<OPENER><DATELINE>From the Hovel at <HI>Hampton-Wick,</HI> <DATE>April 7. 1711.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I first resolved upon doing my self this Honour, I could not but indulge a certain Vanity in dating from this little Covert, where I have frequent∣ly had the Honour of your Lord∣ship's Company, and received from you very many Obligations. The elegant Solitude of this Place, and
<PB REF="4"/>
the greatest Pleasures of it I owe to its being so near those Beautiful Man∣nors wherein you sometimes reside: It is not retiring from the World, but enjoying its most valuable Bles∣sings, when a Man is permitted to share in your Lordship's Conversa∣tions in the Country. All the bright Images which the Wits of past Ages have left behind them in their Wri∣tings, the noble Plans which the greatest Statesmen have laid down for Administration of Affairs, are equally the familiar Objects of your Knowledge. But what is peculiar to your Lordship above all the illu∣strious Personages that have appear∣ed in any Age, is, that Wit and Learning have from your Example fallen into a new <HI>Aera.</HI> Your Pa∣tronage has produced those Arts, which before shunned the Com∣merce of the World, into the Ser∣vice of Life; and it is to you we owe, that the Man of Wit has turn∣ed himself to be a Man of Business. The false Delicacy of Men of Ge∣nius,
<PB REF="5"/>
and the Objections which o∣thers were apt to insinuate against their Abilities for entring into Af∣fairs, have equally vanished. And Experience has shown, that Men of Letters are not only qualify'd with a greater Capacity, but also a grea∣ter Integrity in the Dispatch of Bu∣siness. Your own Studies have been diverted from being the highest Or∣nament, to the highest Use to Man∣kind, and the Capacities which would have rendered you the greatest Poet of your Age, have to the Advan∣tage of <HI>Great Britain</HI> been employ'd in Pursuits which have made you the most able and unbiassed Patriot. A vigorous Imagination, an exten∣sive Apprehension, and a ready Judg∣ment, have distinguished you in all the illustrious Parts of Administra∣tion, in a Reign attended with such Difficulties, that the same Talents without the same Quickness in the Possession of them would have been incapable of Conquering. The natural Success of such Abilities has advan∣ced
<PB REF="6"/>
you to a Seat in that illustrious House, where you were received by a Crowd of your Relations. Great as you are in your Honours, and Personal Qualities, I know you will forgive, an humble Neighbour, the Vanity of pretending to a Place in your Friendship, and subscribing himself,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the last <HI>Tatler</HI> I promised some Explana∣tion of Passages and Persons mention'd in this Work, as well as some Account of the Assi∣stances I have had in the Performance. I shall do this in very few Words; for when a Man has no Design but to speak plain Truth, he may say a great deal in a very narrow Compass. I have in the Dedication of the First Volume made my Acknowledgments to Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> whose plea∣sant Writings, in the Name of <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> crea∣ted an Inclination in the Town towards any Thing that could appear in the same Disguise. I must acknowledge also, that at my first entring upon this Work, a certain uncommon Way of Thinking, and a Turn in Conversation peculiar to that agree∣able Gentleman, rendered his Company very ad∣vantageous to one whose Imagination was to be continually employed upon obvious and common Subjects, though at the same Time obliged to treat of them in a new and unbeaten Method. His Verses on the <HI>Shower in Town,</HI> and the <HI>De∣scription of the Morning,</HI> are Instances of the Happiness of that Genius, which could raise such Pleasing Idea's upon Occasions so barren to an ordinary Invention.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
When I am upon the House of <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> I must not forget that Genealogy of the Family sent to me by the Post, and written, as I since under∣stand, by Mr. <HI>Twisden,</HI> who died at the Battle of <HI>Mons,</HI> and has a Monument in <HI>Westminster-Abbey</HI> suitable to the Respect which is due to his Wit and his Valour. There are through the Course of the Work very many Incidents which were written by unknown Correspondents. Of this Kind is the Tale in the Second <HI>Tatler,</HI> and the Epistle from Mr. <HI>Downes</HI> the Prompter, with others which were very well received by the Publick. But I have only one Gentleman, who will be nameless, to thank for any frequent Assi∣stance to me, which indeed it would have been barbarous in him to have denied to one with whom he has lived in an Intimacy from Childhood, con∣sidering the great Ease with which he is able to dispatch the most entertaining Pieces of this Na∣ture. This good Office he performed with such Force of Genius, Humour, Wit and Learning, that I fared like a distressed Prince who calls in a powerful Neighbour to his Aid; I was undone by my Auxiliary; when I had once called him in, I could not subsist without Dependance on him.</P>
<P>The same Hand writ the distinguishing Cha∣racters of Men and Women under the Names of <HI>Musical Instruments, the Distress of the News-Writers, the Inventory of the Play∣house,</HI> and <HI>the Description of the Thermo∣meter,</HI> which I cannot but look upon as the great∣est Embellishments of this Work.</P>
<P><PB REF="9" MS="y"/>
Thus for I thought necessary to say relating to the great Hands which have been concerned in these Volumes, with Relation to the Spirit and Genius of the Work; and am far from pretending to Modesty in making this Acknowledgment. What a Man obtains from the good Opinion and Friend∣ship of worthy Men, is a much greater Honour than he can possibly reap from any Accomplishments of his own. But all the Credit of Wit which was given me by the Gentlemen above-mentioned (with whom I have now accounted) has not been able to attone for the Exceptions made against me for some Raillery in Behalf of that learned Ad∣vocate for the Episcopacy of the Church, and the Liberty of the People, Mr. <HI>Hoadley.</HI> I mention this only to defend my self against the Imputation of being moved rather by Party than Opinion; and I think it is apparent, I have with the ut∣most Frankness allowed Merit wherever I found it, though joined in Interests different from those for which I have declared my self. When my <HI>Fa∣vonius</HI> is acknowledged to be Dr. <HI>Smalridge,</HI> and the amiable Character of the Dean in the Sixty sixth <HI>Tatler</HI> drawn for Dr. <HI>Atterbury,</HI> I hope I need say no more as to my Impartiality.</P>
<P>I really have acted in these Cases with Honesty, and am concerned it should be thought otherwise: For Wit, if a Man had it, unless it be directed to some useful End, is but a wanton frivolous Quality; all that one should value himself upon in this Kind is, that he had some honourable In∣tention in it.</P>
<P><PB REF="10"/>
As for this Point, never Hero in Romance was carried away with a more furious Ambition to conquer Giants and Tyrants, than I have been in extirpating Gamesters and Duellists And indeed, like one of those Knights too, though I was calm before, I am apt to fly out again, when the Thing that first disturbed me is presented to my Ima∣gination. I shall therefore leave off when I am well, and fight with Windmills no more: Only shall be so Arrogant as to say of my self, that in Spite of all the Force of Fashion and Prejudice, in the Face of all the World, I alone bewailed the Condition of an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman, whose Fortune and Life are at this Day precarious; while His Estate is liable to the Demands of Game∣sters, through a false Sense of Justice; and to the Demands of Duellists, through a false Sense of Honour. As to the First of these Orders of Men, I have not one Word more to say of them: As to the latter, I shall conclude all I have more to offer aginst them (with Respect to their being prompted by the Fear of Shame) by applying to the Duellist what I think Dr. <HI>South</HI> says somewhere of the Lyar, <HI>He is a Coward to Man, and a Brave to God.</HI></P>

<P>THERE are some Occasions in Life, where∣in Regards to a Man's self is the most piti∣ful and contemptible of all Passions; and such a Time certainly is when the true publick Spirit of a Nation is run into a Faction against their Friends and Benefactors. I have hinted heretofore some Things which discover the real Sorrow I am in at the Observation, that it is now very much so in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and have had the Honour to be pelted with several Epistles to expostulate with me on that Subject. Among others, one from a Person of the Number of those they call <HI>Quakers,</HI> who seems to admonish me out of pure Zeal and Good-will. But as there is no Character so unjust as that of talking in Party upon all Occa∣sions, without Respect to Merit or Worth on the
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
contrary Side, so there is no Part we can act so justifiable as to speak our Mind when we see Things urged to Extremity, against all that is Praise-worthy or valuable in Life, upon general and groundless Suggestions. But if I have talked too frankly upon such Reflections, my Cor∣respondent has laid before me, after his Way, the Error of it in a Manner that makes me indeed thankful for his Kindness, but the more inclina∣ble to repeat the Imprudence from the Necessity of the Circumstance.</P>

<P>FOrasmuch as I love thee, I cannot any lon∣ger refrain declaring my Mind unto thee concerning some Things. Thou didst thy self indite the Epistle inserted in one of thy late Lucubrations, as thou wouldst have us call them: For verily thy Friend of Stone, and I speak according to Knowledge, hath no Fin∣gers; and tho' he hath a Mouth, yet speaketh he not therewith; nor yet did that Epistle at all come unto thee from the Mansion-house of the Scarlet Whore. It is plain therefore, that the Truth is not in thee: But since thou wouldst lye, couldst thou not lye with more Discretion? Wherefore shouldst thou insult over the Af∣flicted, or add Sorrow unto the Heavy of Heart? Truly this Gall proceedeth not from the Spirit of Meekness. I tell thee moreover, the People of this Land be marvelously given to Change; insomuch that it may lightly come to pass, that before thou art many Years nearer to thy Disso∣lution, thou mayst behold him sitting on a high Place whom thou now laughest to Scorn: And then how wilt thou be glad to humble thy self to the Ground, and lick the Dust of his Feet, that thou mayst find Favour in his Sight? If thou didst meditate as much upon the Word as
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
thou dost upon the prophane Scribblings of the wise Ones of this Generation, thou wouldst have remembred what happened unto <HI>Shimei,</HI> the Son of <HI>Gera</HI> the <HI>Benjamite,</HI> who cursed the good Man <HI>David</HI> in his Distress. <HI>David</HI> par∣doned his Transgression, yet was he afterwards taken as in a Snare by the Words of his own Mouth, and fell by the Sword of <HI>Solomon</HI> the chief Ruler. Furthermore, I do not remember to have heard in the Days of my Youth and Vanity, when, like thine, my Conversation was with the Gentiles, that the Men of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is <HI>Babylon,</HI> ever sued unto the Men of <HI>Carthage</HI> for Tranquility, as thou dost aver: Neither was <HI>Hannibal,</HI> the Son of <HI>Hamilcar,</HI> called Home by his Countrymen, till these saw the Sword of their Enemies at their Gates; And then was it not Time for him, thinkest thou, to return? It appeareth therefore that thou dost prophesy backwards, thou dost row one Way, and look another; and indeed in all Things art thou too much a Time-server; yet seemest thou not to consider what a Day may bring forth. Think of this, and take Tobacco.</P>

<P>If the zealous Writer of the above Letter has any Meaning, it is of too high a Nature to be the Subject of my Lucubrations. I shall therefore wave such high Points, and be as useful as I can to Persons of less Moment than any he hints at. When a Man runs into a little Fame in the World, as he meets with a great deal of Reproach which he does not deserve, so does he also a great deal of Esteem to which he has in himself no Pre∣tensions. Were it otherwise, I am sure no one would offer to put a Law-Case to me: But be∣cause I am an Adept in Physick and Astrology,
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
they will needs perswade me that I am no less a Proficient in all other Sciences. However, the Point mentioned in the following Letter is so plain a one, that I think I need not trouble my self to cast a Figure to be able to discuss it.</P>

<P>IT is some Years ago since the Entail of the Estate of our Family was altered, by passing a Fine in Favour of me (who now am in Pos∣session of it) after some others deceased. The Heirs-General, who live beyond Sea, were ex∣cluded by this Settlement, and the whole Estate is to pass in a new Channel after me and my Heirs. But several Tenants of the Lordship perswade me to let them hereafter hold their Lands of me according to the old Customs of the Barony, and not oblige them to act by the Limitations of the last Settlement. This, they say, will make me more popular among my Departments, and the ancient Vassals of the Estate, to whom any Deviation from the Line of Succession is always invidious.</P>

<P>YOU have by the Fine a plain Right, in which none else of your Family can be your Competitor; for which Reason, by all Means demand Vassalage upon that Title. The con∣trary Advice can be given for no other Purpose in Nature but to betray you, and favour other Pretenders, by making you place a Right which is in you only, upon a Level with a Right which you have in common with others. I am,</P>

There is nothing so dangerous or so pleasing, as Compliments made to us by our Enemies: And my Correspondent tells me, That though he knows several of those who give him this Coun∣sel were at first against passing the Fine in Favour of him; yet is he so touched with their Homage to him, that he can hardly believe they have a Mind to set it aside, in order to introduce the Heirs-General into his Estate.</P>
<P>These are great Evils; but since there is no proceeding with Success in this World, without complying with the Arts of it, I shall use the same Method as my Correspondent's Tenants did with him, in Relation to one whom I never had a Kindness for; but shall, notwithstanding, pre∣sume to give him my Advice.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Majesty will pardon me while I take the Liberty to acquaint you, that some Passages written from your Side of the Water do very much obstruct your Interests. We take it very unkindly that the Prints of <HI>Paris</HI> are so very partial in Favour of one Set of Men among us, and treat the others as irrecon∣cileable to your Interests. Your Writers are very large in recounting any Thing which re∣lates to the Figure and Power of one Party, but are dumb when they should represent the Actions of the other. This is a trifling Cir∣cumstance many here are apt to lay some Stress upon; therefore I thought fit to offer it to your Consideration before you dispatch the next Courier.</P>

<P>OF all the Evils under the Sun, that of ma∣king Vice commendable is the greatest: For it seems to be the Basis of Society, that Ap∣plause and Contempt should be always given to proper Objects. But in this Age we behold Things for which we ought to have an Abhor∣rence, not only received without Disdain, but even valued as Motives of Emulation. This is na∣turally the Destruction of Simplicity of Manners, Openness of Heart, and Generosity of Temper. When one gives ones self the Liberty to range, and run over in ones Thoughts the different Ge∣nius's of Men which one meets in the World, one cannot but observe, that most of the Indi∣rection and Artifice which is used among Men, does not proceed so much from a Degeneracy in Nature, as an Affectation of appearing Men of Consequence by such Practices. By this Means it is, that a cunning Man is so far from being ashamed of being esteemed such, that he secretly rejoices in it. It has been a Sort of Maxim, That the greatest Art is to conceal Art; but I know not how, among some People we meet with, their greatest Cunning is to appear cunning. There is <HI>Polypragmon</HI> makes it the whole Business of his Life to be thought a cunning Fellow, and thinks it a much greater Character to be terrible than agreeable. When it has once enter'd into a Man's Head to have an Ambition to be thought crafty, all other Evils are necessary Consequences. To
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
deceive, is the immediate Endeavour of him who is proud of the Capacity of doing it. It is cer∣tain, <HI>Polypragmon</HI> does all the Ill he possibly can, but pretends to much more than he performs. He is contented in his own Thoughts, and hugs himself in his Closet, that though he is locked up there and doing nothing, the World does not know but that he is doing Mischief. To favour this Suspicion, he gives Half-Looks and Shrugs in his general Behaviour, to give you to under∣stand that you don't know what he means. He is also wonderfully adverbial in his Expressions, and breaks off with a Perhaps and a Nod of the Head, upon Matters of the most indifferent Na∣ture. It is a mighty Practice with Men of this Genius to avoid frequent Appearance in Publick, and to be as mysterious as possible when they do come into Company. There is nothing to be done, according to them, the common Way; and let the Matter in Hand be what it will, it must be carried with an Air of Importance, and trans∣acted, if we may so speak, with an ostentatious Secrecy. These are your Persons of long Heads, who would fain make the World believe their Thoughts and Idea's are very much superior to their Neighbours, and do not value what these their Neighbours think of them, provided they do not reckon them Fools. These have such a Romantick Touch in Business, that they hate to perform any Thing like other Men. Were it in their Choice, they had rather bring their Pur∣poses to bear by over-reaching the Persons they deal with, than by a plain and simple Manner. They make Difficulties for the Honour of sur∣mounting them. <HI>Polypragmon</HI> is eternally busied after this Manner, with no other Prospect than that he is in Hopes to be thought the most cun∣ning of all Men, and fears the Imputation of Want of Understanding much more than that of the Abuse of it. But alas! How contemptible is
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
such an Ambition, which is the very Reverse of all that is truly laudable; and the very Contra∣diction to the only Means to a just Reputation, Simplicity of Manners? Cunning can in no Cir∣cumstance imaginable be a Quality worthy a Man, except in his own Defence, and meerly to con∣ceal himself from such as are so; and in such Cases it is no longer Craft, but Wisdom. The monstrous Affectation of being thought artful, immediately kills all Thoughts of Humanity and Goodness, and gives Men a Sense of the soft Affections and Impulses of the Mind (which are imprinted in us for our mutual Advantage and Succour) as of meer Weaknesses and Follies. Ac∣cording to the Men of Cunning, you are to put off the Nature of a Man as fast as you can, and acquire that of a Daemon, as if it were a more eligible Character to be a powerful Enemy, than an able Friend. But it ought to be a Mortifica∣tion to Men affected this Way, that there wants but little more than Instinct to be considerable in it; for when a Man has arrived at being very bad in his Inclination, he has not much more to do, but to conceal himself, and he may revenge, cheat, and deceive, without much Employment for Understanding, and go on with great Chear∣fulness with the high Applause of being a prodi∣gious cunning Fellow. But indeed, when we ar∣rive at that Pitch of false Taste, as not to think Cunning a contemptible Quality, it is, methinks, a very great Injustice that Pickpockets are had in so little Veneration, who must be admirably well turned, not only for the Theoretick, but al∣so the Practical Behaviour of cunning Fellows. After all the Endeavour of this Family of Men, whom we call cunning, their whole Work falls to Pieces, if others will lay down all Esteem for such Artifices, and treat it as an unmanly Quali∣ty, which they forbear to practise only because they abhor it. When the Spider is ranging in
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>
the different Apartments of his Web, it is true that he only can weave so fine a Thread; but it is in the Power of the meerest Drone that has Wings to fly through and destroy it.</P>

<P>Tho' the Taste of Wit and Pleasure is at pre∣sent but very low in this Town, yet there are some that preserve their Relish undebauched with common Impressions, and can distinguish between Reality and Imposture. A Gentleman was saying here this Evening, That he would go to the Play to Morrow Night to see Heroism, as it has been represented by some of our Tragedians, repre∣sented in Burlesque. It seems, the Play of <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> is to be then turned into Ridicule for its Bombast, and other false Ornaments in the Thought as well as the Language. The Bluster <HI>Alexander</HI> makes, is as much inconsistent with the Character of an Hero, as the Roughness of <HI>Clytus</HI> an Instance of the Sincerity of a bold art∣less Soldier. To be plain is not to be rude, but rather inclines a Man to Civility and Deference; not indeed to show it in the Gestures of the Bo∣dy, but in the Sentiments of the Mind. It is among other Things from the impertinent Fi∣gures unskilful Dramatists draw of the Chara∣cters of Men, that Youth are bewildered and pre∣judiced in their Sense of the World, of which they have no Notions but what they draw from Books and such Representations. Thus talk to a very young Man, let him be of never so good Sense, and he shall smile when you speak of Sin∣cerity in a Courtier, good Sense in a Soldier, or Honesty in a Politician. The Reason of this is, That you hardly see one Play wherein each of these Ways of Life is not drawn by Hands that know nothing of any one of them: And the Truth is so far of the opposite Side to what they paint, that it is more impracticable to live in Esteem in Courts than any where else without Sincerity. Good
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>
Sense is the great Requisite in a Soldier, and Ho∣nesty the only Thing that can support a Politi∣cian. This Way of Thinking made the Gentle∣man of whom I was just now speaking say, He was glad any one had taken upon him to depre∣ciate such unnatural Fustian as the Tragedy of <HI>Alexander.</HI> The Character of that Prince indeed was, That he was unequal, and given to Intem∣perance; but in his sober Moments, when he had warm in his Imagination the Precepts of his great Instructor, he was a Pattern of generous Thoughts and Dispositions, in Opposition to the strongest Desires which are incident to a Youth and Con∣queror. But instead of representing that Hero in the glorious Character of Generosity and Chasti∣ty, in his Treatment of the beauteous Family of <HI>Darius,</HI> he is drawn all along as a Monster of Lust, or of Cruelty; as if the Way to raise him to the Degree of an Hero, were to make his Cha∣racter as little like that of a worthy Man as pos∣sible. Such rude and indigested Draughts of Things are the proper Objects of Ridicule and Contempt, and depreciating <HI>Alexander,</HI> as we have him drawn, is the only Way of restoring him to what he was in himself. It is well con∣trived of the Players to let this Part be followed by a true Picture of Life, in the Comedy call'd, <HI>The Chances,</HI> wherein Don <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Constantia</HI> are acted to the utmost Perfection. There need not be a greater Instance of the Force of Action than in many Incidents of this Play, where indif∣ferent Passages, and such that conduce only to the tacking of the Scenes together, are enlivened with such an agreeable Gesture and Behaviour, as apparently shows what a Play might be, tho' it is not wholly what a Play should be.</P>

<P>SOme Years since I was engaged with a Coach full of Friends to take a Journey as far as the <HI>Land's-End.</HI> We were very well pleased with one another the first Day, every one endeavouring to recommend himself by his good Humour and Complaisance to the rest of the Company. This good Correspondence did not last long; one of our Party was sowred the very first Evening by a Plate of Butter which had not been melted to his Mind, and which spoiled his Temper to such a Degree, that he continued upon the Fret to the End of our Journey. A Second fell off from his good Humour the next Morning, for no other Reason that I could imagine, but because I chanced to step into the Coach before him, and place my self on the shady Side. This however was but my own private Guess, for he did not mention a Word of it, nor indeed of any Thing else, for Three Days following. The rest of our Company held out very near half the Way, when of a sudden Mr. <HI>Sprightly</HI> fell asleep; and in∣stead of endeavouring to divert and oblige us, as he had hitherto done, carried himself with an unconcerned, careless, drowzy Behaviour, till we came to uur last Stage. There were Three of us who still held up our Heads, and did all we could to make our Journey agreeable; but, to my Shame be it spoken, about Three Miles on this Side <HI>Exeter,</HI> I was taken with an unaccountable
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
Fit of Sullenness, that hung upon me for above Threescore Miles; whether it were for Want of Respect, or from an accidental.

<P>There was another Coach that went along with us, in which I likewise observed, that there were many secret Jealousies, Heart-burnings, and Ani∣mosities: For when we joined Companies at Night, I could not but take Notice, that the Pas∣sengers neglected their own Company, and stu∣died how to make themselves esteemed by us, who were altogether Strangers to them; till at length they grew so well acquainted with us, that they liked us as little as they did one another. When I reflect upon this Journey, I often fancy it to be a Picture of Humane Life, in Respect to the several Friendships, Contracts, and Alliances, that are made and dissolved in the several Periods of it. The most delightful and most lasting En∣gagements are generally those which pass between Man and Woman; and yet upon what Trifles are they weakened, or entirely broken? Sometimes the Parties fly asunder, even in the Midst of Courtship, and sometimes grow cool in the very Honey Month. Some separate before the First Child, and some after the Fifth; others continue good till Thirty, others till Forty; while some few, whose Souls are of an happier Make, and better fitted to one another, travel on toge∣ther to the End of their Journey in a continual Intercourse of kind Offices and mutual Endear∣ments.</P>
<P>When we therefore chuse our Companions for Life, if we hope to keep both them and our selves in good Humour to the last Stage of it, we must be extreamly careful in the Choice we make, as well as in the Conduct on our own
<PB N="13" REF="23"/>
Part. When the Persons to whom we join our selves can stand an Examination, and bear the Scrutiny, when they mend upon our Acquain∣tance with them, and discover new Beauties the more we search into their Characters, our Love will naturally rise in Proportion to their Per∣fections.</P>
<P>But because there are very few possessed of such Accomplishments of Body and Mind, we ought to look after those Qualifications both in our selves and others, which are indispensibly ne∣cessary towards this happy Union, and which are in the Power of every one to acquire, or at least to cultivate and improve. These, in my Opinion, are Chearfulness and Constancy. A chearful Temper joined with Innocence, will make Beau∣ty attractive, Knowledge delightful, and Wit good-natured. It will lighten Sickness, Poverty, and Affliction; convert Ignorance into an amia∣ble Simplicity, and render Deformity it self agree∣able.</P>
<P>Constancy is natural to Persons of even Tem∣pers and uniform Dispositions, and may be ac∣quired by those of the greatest Fickleness, Vio∣lence and Passion, who consider seriously the Terms of Union upon which they come together, the mutual Interest in which they are engaged, with all the Motives that ought to incite their Tenderness and Compassion towards those who have their Dependance upon them, and are em∣barked with them for Life in the same State of Happiness or Misery. Constancy, when it grows in the Mind upon Considerations of this Nature, becomes a Moral Virtue, and a kind of good Na∣ture, that is not subject to any Change of Health, Age, Fortune, or any of those Accidents which are apt to unsettle the best Dispositions that are founded rather in Constitution than in Reason. Where such a Constancy as this is wanting, the most enflamed Passion may fall away into Cold∣ness
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>
and Indifference, and the most melting Ten∣derness degenerate into Hatred and Aversion. I shall conclude this Paper with a Story that is ve∣ry well known in the North of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>About Thirty Years ago, a Packet-Boat that had several Passengers on Board was cast away upon a Rock, and in so great Danger of sinking, that all who were in it endeavoured to save themselves as well at they could, though only those who could swim well had a bare Possibility of doing it. Among the Passengers there were Two Women of Fashion, who seeing themselves in such a disconsolate Condition, begged of their Husbands not to leave them. One of them chose rather to die with his Wife, than to forsake her; the other, though he was moved with the ut∣most Compassion for his Wife, told her, That for the Good of their Children it was better one of them should live, than both perish. By a great Piece of good Luck, next to a Miracle, when one of our good Men had taken the last and long Farewel in order to save himself, and the other held in his Arms the Person that was dearer to him than Life, the Ship was preserved. It is with a secret Sorrow and Vexation of Mind that I must tell the Sequel of the Story, and let my Reader know, that this faithful Pair who were ready to have died in each others Arms, about Three Years after their Escape, upon some tri∣fling Disgust, grew to a Coldness at first, and at length fell out to such a Degree, that they left one another, and parted for ever. The other Couple lived together in an uninterrupted Friend∣ship and Felicity; and what was remarkable, the Husband whom the Shipwreck had like to have separated from his Wife, died a few Months after her, not being able to survive the Loss of her.</P>
<P>I must confess, there is something in the Changeableness and Inconstancy of Humane Na∣ture, that very often both dejects and terrifies
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>
me. Whatever I am at present, I tremble to think what I may be. While I find this Principle in me, How can I assure my self that I shall be always true to my God, my Friend, or my self? In short, without Constancy there is neither Love, Friendship, or Virtue, in the World.</P>

<P>I Have of late received many Epistles, where∣in the Writers treat me as a mercenary Person for some late Hints concerning Matters which they think I should not have touched upon but for sordid Considerations. It is apparent, that my Motive could not be of that Kind; for when a Man declares him self openly on one Side, that Party will take no more Notice of him, because he is sure; and the Set of Men whom he declares against, for the same Reason are violent against him. Thus it is Folly in a Plain-Dealer to ex∣pect, that either his Friends will reward him, or his Enemies forgive him. For which Reason, I thought it was the shortest Way to Impartiality, to put my self beyond further Hopes or Fears, by declaring my self, at a Time when the Dis∣pute is not about Persons and Parties, but Things and Causes. To relieve my self from the Vexa∣tion which naturally attends such Reflections, I came hither this Evening to give my Thoughts
<PB N="16" REF="26"/>
quite a new Turn, and converse with Men of Pleasure and Wit, rather than those of Business and Intrigue. I had hardly entered the Room, when I was accosted by Mr. <HI>Thomas Dogget,</HI> who desired my Favour in Relation to the Play which was to be acted for his Benefit on <HI>Thursday.</HI> He pleased me in saying it was <HI>The Old Batchelor,</HI> in which Comedy there is a necessary Circumstance observ'd by the Author, which most other Poets either overlook or do not understand, that is to say, the Distinction of Characters. It is very or∣dinary with Writers to indulge a certain Modesty of believing all Men as witty as themselves, and making all the Persons of the Play speak the Sentiments of the Author, without any Manner of Respect to the Age, Fortune, or Quality, of him that is on the Stage. Ladies talk like Rakes, and Footmen make Similes: But this Writer knows Men. which makes his Plays reasonable Enter∣tainments, while the Scenes of most others are like the Tunes between the Acts. They are per∣haps agreeable Sounds, but they have no Idea's affixed to them. <HI>Dogget</HI> thanked me for my Vi∣sit to him in the Winter, and, after his Comick Manner, spoke his Request with so arch a Leer, that I promised the Drole I would speak to all my Acquaintance to be at his Play.</P>
<P>Whatever the World may think of the Actors, whether it be that their Parts have an Effect on their Lives, or whatever it is, you see a wonder∣ful Benevolence among them towards the Inte∣rests and Necessities of each other. <HI>Dogget</HI> there∣fore would not let me go, without delivering me a Letter from poor old <HI>Downes</HI> the Prompter, wherein that Retainer to the Theatre desires my Advice and Assistance in a Matter of Concern to him. I have sent him my private Opinion for his Conduct; but the Stage and the State Af∣fairs being so much canvassed by Parties and Fa∣ctions, I shall for some Time hereafter take Leave
<PB N="17" REF="27"/>
of Subjects which relate to either of them, and employ my Care in the Consideration of Matters which regard that Part of Mankind who live without interesting themselves with the Troubles or Pleasures of either. However, for a meer Notion of the present Posture of the Stage, I shall give you the Letter at large as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 1. 1710.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FInding by divers of your late Papers, that you are a Friend to the Profession of which I was many Years an unworthy Member, I the rather make bold to crave your Advice, touch∣ing a Proposal that has been lately made me of coming again into Business, and the Sub-Admini∣stration of Stage Affairs. I have, from my Youth, been bred up behind the Curtain, and been a Prompter from the Time of the Restoration. I have seen many Changes, as well of Scenes as of Actors, and have known Men within my Remembrance arrive to the highest Dignities of the Theatre, who made their Entrance in the Quality of Mutes, Joint-stools, Flower-pots, and Tapestry Hangings. It cannot be unknown to the Nobility and Gentry, That a Gentleman of the Inns of Court, and a deep Intriguer, had some Time since worked himself into the sole Management and Direction of the Theatre. Nor is it less notorious, That his restless Am∣bition, and subtle Machinations, did manifestly tend to the Extirpation of the good old <HI>British</HI> Actors, and the Introduction of foreign Pre∣tenders; such as Harlequins, <HI>French</HI> Dancers, and <HI>Roman</HI> Singers; which, though they impo∣verish'd the Proprietors, and imposed on the Audience, were for some Time tolerated, by Reason of his dextrous Insinuations, which pre∣vailed upon a few deluded Women, especially the Vizard Masks, to believe that the Stage was in Danger. But his Schemes were soon
<PB N="18" REF="28"/>
exposed, and the Great Ones that supported him withdrawing their Favour, he made his Exit, and remained for a Season in Obscurity. During this Retreat the Machiavilian was not idle, but secretly fomented Divisions, and wrought over to his Side some of the inferior Actors, reserving a Trap Door to himself, to which only he had a Key. This Entrance se∣cured, this cunning Person, to compleat his Company, bethought himself of calling in the most eminent of Strollers from all Parts of the Kingdom. I have seen them all ranged toge∣ther behind the Scenes; but they are many of them Persons that never trod the Stage before, and so very aukward and ungainly, that it is impossible to believe the Audience will bear them. He was looking over his Catalogue of Plays, and indeed picked up a good tolerable Set of grave Faces for Counsellors, to appear in the famous Scene of <HI>Venice Preserv'd,</HI> when the Danger is over; but they being but meer Outsides, and the Actors having a great Mind to play <HI>The Tempest,</HI> there is not a Man of them, when he is to perform any Thing above Dumb Show, is capable of acting with a good Grace so much as the Part of <HI>Trincalo.</HI> However, the Master persists in his Design, and is fitting up the old Storm; but I am afraid he will not be able to procure able Sailors or experienced Offi∣cers for Love or Money.</P>
<P>Besides all this, when he comes to cast the Parts, there is so great a Confusion amongst them for Want of proper Actors, that for my Part I am wholly discouraged. The Play with which they design to open is, <HI>The Duke and no Duke;</HI> and they are so put to it, that the Master him∣self is to act the Conjurer, and they have no one for the General but honest <HI>George Powell.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Sir, they being so much at a Loss for the <HI>Dramatis Personae, viz.</HI> the Persons to enact,
<PB N="19" REF="29"/>
and the whole Frame of the House being de∣signed to be altered, I desire your Opinion, whether you think it advisable for me to un∣dertake to prompt 'em? For though I can clash Swords when they represent a Battle, and have yet Lungs enough left to huzza their Victo∣ries, I question, if I should prompt 'em right, whether they would act accordingly. I am</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> Sir, Since I writ this, I am credibly in∣formed, That they design a new House in <HI>Lin∣colns-Inn-Fields,</HI> near the Popish Chapel, to be ready by <HI>Michaelmas</HI> next; which indeed is but repairing an old one that has already failed. You know the honest Man who kept the Office is gone already.</P>

<P>I Was this Morning reading the Tenth Canto in the Fourth Book of <HI>Spencer,</HI> in which Sir <HI>Scudamore</HI> relates the Progress of his Courtship to <HI>Amoret</HI> under a very beautiful Allegory, which is one of the most natural and unmixed of any in that most excellent Author. I shall transprose it, to use Mr. <HI>Bays</HI>'s Term, for the Benefit of many <HI>English</HI> Lovers, who have by frequent Let∣ters desired me to lay down some Rules for the Conduct of their virtuous Amours; and shall
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>
only premise, That by the Shield of Love, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meant a generous, constant Passion for the Per¦son beloved.</P>
<P>When the Fame, says he, of this celebrated Beauty first flew Abroad, I went in Pursuit of her to the <HI>Temple of Love.</HI> This Temple, continues he, bore the Name of the Goddess <HI>Venus,</HI> and was seated in a most fruitful Island, walled by Nature against all Invaders. There was a single Bridge that led into the Island, and before it a Castle garrison'd by Twenty Knights. Near the Castle was an open Plain, and in the midst of it a Pillar, on which was hung the Shield of Love; and underneath it, in Letters of Gold, was this Inscription:</P>
<Q><L>Happy the Man who well can use his Bliss;</L>
<L>Whose ever be the Shield, Fair <HI>Amoret</HI> be his.</L></Q>
<P>My Heart panted upon reading the Inscription: I struck upon the Shield with my Spear. Imme∣diately issued forth a Knight well mounted, and compleatly armed, who, without speaking, ran fiercely at me. I received him as well as I could, and by good Fortune threw him out of the Sad∣dle. I encountered the whole Twenty succes∣sively, and leaving them all extended on the Plain, carried off the Shield in Token of Victo∣ry. Having thus vanquish'd my Rivals, I passed on without Impediment, till I came to the outer∣most Gate of the Bridge, which I found locked and barred. I knocked and called, but could get no Answer. At last I saw one on the other Side of the Gate, who stood peeping through a small Crevice. This was the Porter; he had a double Face resembling a <HI>Janus,</HI> and was continually looking about him, as if he mistrusted some sud∣den Danger. His Name, as I afterwards learn∣ed, was <HI>Doubt.</HI> Over-against him sat <HI>Delay,</HI> who entertained Passengers with some idle Story, while they lost such Opportunities as were never
<PB N="21" REF="31"/>
to be recovered. As soon as the Porter saw my Shield, he opened the Gate; but upon my en∣tring, <HI>Delay</HI> caught hold of me, and would fain have made me listen to her Fooleries. However, I shook her off, and passed forward till I came to the Second Gate, <HI>The Gate of good Desert,</HI> which always stood wide open, but in the Porch was an hideous Giant, that stop'd the Entrance: His Name was <HI>Danger.</HI> Many Warriors of good Reputation, not able to bear the Sternness of his Look, went back again. Cowards fled at the first Sight of him, except some few, who watch∣ing their Opportunity, slipt by him unobserv'd. I prepared to assault him; but upon the first Sight of my Shield, he immediately gave Way. Look∣ing back upon him, I found his hinder Parts much more deformed and terrible than his Face; <HI>Hatred, Murther, Treason, Envy,</HI> and <HI>Detraction,</HI> lying in Ambush behind him, to fall upon the Heedless and Unwary.</P>
<P>I now entered <HI>The Island of Love,</HI> which ap∣peared in all the Beauties of Art and Nature, and feasted every Sense with the most agreeable Objects. Amidst a pleasing Variety of Walks and Allies, shady Seats, and flowry Banks, sun∣ny Hills, and gloomy Valleys, were Thousands of Lovers sitting, or walking together in Pairs, and singing Hymns to the Deity of the Place.</P>
<P>I could not forbear envying this happy People, who were already in Possession of all they could desire. While I went forward to the Temple, the Structure was beautiful beyond Imagination. The Gate stood open. In the Entrance sat a most amiable Woman, whose Name was <HI>Concord.</HI></P>
<P>On either Side of her stood Two young Men, both strongly armed, as if afraid of each other. As I afterwards learned they were both her Sons, but begotten of her by Two different Fathers; their Names, <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hatred.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="32"/>
The Lady so well tempered and reconciled them both, that she forced them to join Hands, tho' I could not but observe, that <HI>Hatred</HI> turned aside his Face, as not able to endure the Sight of his younger Brother.</P>
<P>I at length entered the Inmost Temple, the Roof of which was raised upon an Hundred Marble Pillars, decked with Crowns, Chains, and Garlands. The Ground was strowed with Flowers. An Hundred Altars, at each of which stood a Virgin Priestess cloathed in White, blazed all at once with the Sacrifice of Lovers, who were perpetually sending up their Vows to Hea∣ven in Clouds of Incense.</P>
<P>In the Midst stood the Goddess her self, upon an Altar, whose Substance was neither Gold nor Stone, but infinitely more precious than either. About her Neck flew numberless Flocks of little <HI>Loves, Joys,</HI> and <HI>Graces;</HI> and all about her Altar lay scattered Heaps of <HI>Lovers,</HI> complaining of the Disdain, Pride, or Treachery, of their Mistresses. One among the rest, no longer able to contain his Griefs, broke out into the following Prayer: <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Venus,</HI> Queen of Grace and Beauty, Joy of Gods and Men, who with a Smile becalmest the Seas, and renewest all Nature; Goddess, whom all the different Species in the Universe obey with Joy and Pleasure, grant I may at last obtain the Object of my Vows.'</Q></P>
<P>The impatient Lover pronounced this with great Vehemence; but I in a soft Murmur be∣sought the Goddess to lend me her Assistance. While I was thus praying, I chanced to cast my Eye on a Company of Ladies, who were assem∣bled together in a Corner of the Temple waiting for the Anthem.</P>
<P>The foremost seemed something elder, and of a more composed Countenance than the rest, who all appeared to be under her Direction. Her Name was <HI>Womanhood.</HI> On one Side of her sat
<PB N="23" REF="33"/>
<HI>Shamefacedness,</HI> with Blushes rising in her Cheeks, and her Eyes fixed upon the Ground: On the o∣ther was <HI>Chearfulness,</HI> with a smiling Look, that infused a secret Pleasure into the Hearts of all that saw her. With these sat <HI>Modesty,</HI> holding her Hand on her Heart; <HI>Courtesie,</HI> with a grace∣ful Aspect, and obliging Behaviour; and the Two Sisters, who were always linked together, and resembled each other, <HI>Silence</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Thus sat they all around in seemly Rate,</L>
<L>And in the Midst of them a goodly Maid;</L>
<L>Ev'n in the Lap of <HI>Womanhood</HI> there sate,</L>
<L>The which was all in Lilly-white array'd,</L>
<L>Where Silver Streams among the Linen stray'd;</L>
<L>Like to the Morn, when first her shining Face</L>
<L>Hath to the Gloomy World it self bewray'd.</L>
<L>That same was fairest <HI>Amoret</HI> in Place,</L>
<L>Shining with Beauty's Light, and Heav'nly Vir∣tue's Grace.</L></Q>
<P>As soon as I beheld the charming <HI>Amoret,</HI> my Heart throbbed with Hopes. I stepped to her, and seized her Hand; when <HI>Womanhood</HI> imme∣diately rising up, sharply rebuked me for offer∣ing in so rude a Manner to lay hold on a Virgin. I excused my self as modestly as I could, and at the same Time displayed my Shield; upon which, as soon as she beheld the God emblazoned with his Bow and Shafts, she was struck mute, and instantly retired.</P>
<P>I still held fast the fair <HI>Amoret,</HI> and turning my Eyes towards the Goddess of the Place, saw that she favoured my Pretensions with a Smile, which so emboldened me, that I carried off my Prize.</P>
<P>The Maid, sometimes with Tears, sometimes with Smiles, entreated me to let her go: But I led her through the Temple-Gate, where the Goddess <HI>Concord,</HI> who had favoured my Entrance, befriended my Retreat.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="34"/>
This Allegory is so natural, that it explains it self. The Persons in it are very artfully descri∣bed, and disposed in proper Places. The Posts assigned to <HI>Doubt, Delay,</HI> and <HI>Danger,</HI> are admi∣rable. The Gate of <HI>Good Desert</HI> has something noble and instructive in it. But above all, I am most pleased with the beautiful Grouppe of Fi∣gures in the Corner of the Temple. Among these, <HI>Womanhood</HI> is drawn like what the Philo∣sophers call an Universal Nature, and is attended with beautiful Representatives of all those Vir∣tues that are the Ornaments of the Female Sex, considered in its natural Perfection and Inno∣cence.</P>

<P>THE Learned World are very much offend∣ed at many of my Ratiocinations, and have but a very mean Opinion of me as a Politician. The Reason of this is, That some erroneously conceive a Talent for Politicks to consist in the Regard to a Man's own Interest; but I am of quite another Mind, and think the first and essen∣tial Quality towards being a Statesman is to have a publick Spirit. One of the Gentlemen who are out of Humour with me, imputes my falling into a Way wherein I am so very aukward to a Barrenness of Invention, and has the Charity to lay new Matter before me for the future. He is at the Bottom my Friend, but is at a Loss to know whether I am a Fool or a Physician, and is pleased to expostulate with me with Relation to the latter. He falls heavy upon Licentiates, and seems to point more particularly at us who are
<PB N="25" REF="35"/>
not regularly of the Faculty. But since he has been so civil to me as to meddle only with those who are employed no further than about Men's Lives, and not reflected upon me as of the Astro∣logical Sect, who concern our selves about Lives and Fortunes also, I am not so much hurt as to stifle any Part of his fond Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am afraid there is something in the Suspi∣cions of some People, that you begin to be short of Matter for your Lucubrations. Tho' several of them now and then did appear some∣what dull and insipid to me, I was always cha∣ritably inclined to believe the Fault lay in my self, and that I wanted the true Key to unci∣pher your Mysteries, and remember your Ad∣vertisement upon this Account. But since I have seen you fall in an unpardonable Error, yea, with a Relapse: I mean, since I have seen you turn Politician in the present unhappy Dis∣sentions. I have begun to stagger, and could not chuse but lessen the great Value I had for the Censor of our Isle. How is it possible that a Man, whom Interest did naturally lead to a constant Impartiality in these Matters, and who hath Wit enough to judge, that his Opinion was not like to make many Proselytes? How is it possible, I say, that a little Passion (for I have still too good an Opinion of you to think you was bribed by the Staggering Party) could blind you so far as to offend the very better half of the Nation, and to lessen off so much the Number of your Friends? Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI> will not have Cause to thank you, unless you give over, and endeavour to regain what you have lost. There is still a great many Themes you have left untouched; such as the ill Manage∣ments of Matters relating to Law and Physick, the setting down Rules for knowing the Quacks
<PB N="26" REF="36"/>
in both Professions. What a large Field is there left in discovering the Abuses of the College, who had a Charter and Privileges granted them to hinder the creeping in and prevailing of Quacks and Pretenders; and yet grant Licences to Barbers, and write Letters of Recommenda∣tion in the Country Towns, out of the Reach of their Practice, in Favour of meer Boys; va∣luing the Health and Lives of their Country∣men no farther than they get Money by them. You have said very little or nothing about the Dispensation of Justice in Town and Country, where Clerks are the Counsellors to their Ma∣sters.</P>
<P>But as I can't expect that the Censor of <HI>Great Britain</HI> should publish a Letter, wherein he is censured with too much Reason himself; yet I hope you will be the better for it, and think upon the Themes I have mentioned, which must certainly be of greater Service to the World, your self, and Mr. <HI>Morphew,</HI> than to let us know whether you are a <HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Tory.</HI> I am still</P>

<P>This Gentleman and I differ about the Words, Staggering and Better Part; but instead of an∣swering to the Particulars of this Epistle, I shall only acquaint my Correspondent, That I am at present forming my Thoughts upon the Founda∣tion of Sir <HI>Scudamore</HI>'s Progress in <HI>Spencer,</HI> which has led me from all other Amusements, to consi∣der the State of Love in this Island; and from the Corruptions in the Government of that, to deduce the chief Evils of Life. In the mean Time that I am thus employed, I have given po∣sitive Orders to Don <HI>Saltero</HI> of <HI>Chelsea</HI> the Tooth-Drawer, and Dr. <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> the Corn-Cutter of <HI>King-street, Westminster,</HI> (who have the Mo∣desty
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>
to confine their Pretensions to Manual Ope∣rations) to bring me in, with all convenient Speed, compleat Lists of all who are but of equal Learning with themselves, and yet administer Physick beyond the Feet and Gums. These Ad∣vices I shall reserve for my future Leisure; but have now taken a Resolution to dedicate the re∣maining Part of this Instant <HI>July</HI> to the Service of the Fair Sex, and have almost finished a Scheme for settling the whole Remainder of that Sex who are unmarried, and above the Age of Twen∣ty five.</P>
<P>In order to this good and publick Service, I shall consider the Passion of Love in its full Ex∣tent, as it is attended both with Joys and Inquie∣tudes; and lay down, for the Conduct of my Lovers, such Rules as shall banish the Cares, and heighten the Pleasures, which flow from that amiable Spring of Life and Happiness. There is no less than an absolute Necessity that some Pro∣vision be made to take off the dead Stock of Wo∣men in City, Town, and Country. Let there happen but the least Disorder in the Streets. and in an Instant you see the Inequality of the Num∣bers of Males and Females. Besides that the Feminine Crowd on such Occasions is more nu∣merous in the open Way, you may observe them also to the very Garrets huddled together, Four at least at a Casement. Add to this, that by an exact Calculation of all that have come to Town by Stage-Coach or Waggon for this Twelvemonth last, Three Times in Four the treated Persons have been Males. This over-stock of Beauty, for which there are so few Bidders, calls for an im∣mediate Supply of Lovers and Husbands; and I am the studious Knight-Errant who have suffer'd long Nocturnal Contemplations to find out Me∣thods for the Relief of all <HI>British</HI> Females, who at present seem to be devoted to involuntary Vir∣ginity. The Scheme upon which I design to act,
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>
I have communicated to none but a beauteous young Lady, (who has for some Time left the Town) in the following Letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To <HI>Amanda</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send with this, my Discourse of Ways and Means for encouraging Marriage, and re∣peopling the Island. You will soon observe, that according to these Rules, the mean Consi∣derations (which make Beauty and Merit cease to be the Objects of Love and Courtship) will be fully exploded. I have unanswerably pro∣ved, that Jointures and Settlements are the Bane of Happiness; and not only so, but the Ruin even of their Fortunes who enter into them. I beg of you therefore to come to Town upon the Receipt of this, where I pro∣mise you, you shall have as many Lovers as Toasters; for there needed nothing but to make Men's Interests fall in with their Inclinations, to render you the most courted of your Sex. As many as love you will now be willing to marry you: Hasten then, and be the honoura∣ble Mistress of Mankind. <HI>Cassander,</HI> and many others, stand in <HI>the Gate of Good Descrt</HI> to re∣ceive you. I am,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>July 10.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE intended Course of my Studies was al∣tered this Evening by a Visit from an old Acquaintance, who complained to me, mention∣ing one upon whom he had long depended, that he found his Labour and Perseverance in his Pa∣tron's Service and Interests wholly ineffectual; and he thought now, after his best Years were spent in a professed Adherence to him and his Fortunes, he should in the End be forced to break with him, and give over all further Ex∣pectations from him. He sighed, and ended his Discourse, by saying, <Q REND="inline">'You, Mr. Censor, some Time ago, gave us your Thoughts of the Beha∣viour of great Men to their Creditors.'</Q> This Sort of Demand upon them, for what they invite Men to expect, is a Debt of Honour, which, ac∣cording to Custom, they ought to be most care∣ful of paying, and would be a very worthy Sub∣ject for a Lucubration.</P>
<P>Of all Men living, I think, I am the most pro∣per to treat of this Matter; because in the Cha∣racter and Employment of Censor, I have had Encouragement so infinitely above my Desert, that what I say cannot possibly be supposed to arise from Peevishness, or any Disappointment in that Kind which I my self have met with. When we consider Patrons and their Clients, those who receive Addresses, and those who are
<PB N="30" REF="40"/>
addressed to, it must not be understood that the Dependants are such as are worthless in their Natures, abandoned to any Vice or Dishonour, or such as without a Call thrust themselves upon Men in Power; nor when we say Patrons, do we mean such as have it not in their Power, or have no Obligation to assist their Friends; but we speak of such Leagues where there are Power and Obligation on the one Part, and Merit and Expectation on the other. Were we to be very particular on this Subject, I take it, that the Di∣vision of Patron and Client may include a Third Part of our Nation. The Want of Merit and real Worth will strike out about Ninety nine in the Hundred of these, and Want of Ability in the Patron will dispose of as many of that Or∣der. He who out of meer Vanity to be applied to will take up another's Time and Fortune in his Service, where he has no Prospect of returning it, is as much more unjust as those who took up my Friend the Upholder's Goods without paying him for them. I say, he is much more unjust, as our Life and Time is more valuable than our Goods and Moveables. Among many whom you see about the Great, there is a contented well∣pleased Set, who seem to like the Attendance for its own Sake, and are early at the Abodes of the powerful, out of meer Fashion. This Sort of Vanity is as well grounded, as if a Man should lay aside his own plain Suit, and dress himself up in a gay Livery of anothers.</P>
<P>There are many of this Species who exclude others of just Expectation, and make those pro∣per Dependants appear impatient, because they are not so chearful as those who expect nothing. I have made use of the Penny-Post for the In∣struction of these voluntary Slaves, and informed them, that they will never be provided for; but they double their Diligence upon Admonition. <HI>Will Afterday</HI> has told his Friends, that he was
<PB N="31" REF="41"/>
to have the next Thing these Ten Years; and <HI>Harry Linger</HI> has been Fourteen within a Month of a considerable Office. However, the fanta∣stick Complaisance which is paid to them may blind the Great from seeing themselves in a just Light, they must needs (if they in the least re∣flect) at some Times have a Sense of the Injustice they do in raising in others a false Expectation. But this is so common a Practice in all the Stages of Power, that there are not more Cripples come out of the Wars, than from the Attendance of Patrons. You see in one a settled Melancholy, in another a bridled Rage, a Third has lost his Memory, and a Fourth his whole Constitution and Humour. In a Word, when you see a par∣ticular Cast of Mind or Body, which looks a lit∣tle upon the Distracted, you may be sure the poor Gentleman has formerly had great Friends. For this Reason, I have thought it a prudent Thing to take a Nephew of mine out of a Ladies Service, where he was a Page, and have bound him to a Shoemaker.</P>
<P>But what of all the Humours under the Sun is the most pleasant to consider, is, That you see some Men lay as it were a Set of Acquaintance by them, to converse with when they are out of Employment, who had no Effect of their Power when they were in. Here Patrons and Clients both make the most fantastical Figure imagina∣ble. Friendship indeed is most manifested in Adversity; but I do not know how to behave my self to a Man who thinks me his Friend at no other Time but that. <HI>Dick Reptile</HI> of our Club had this in his Head t'other Night, when he said, I am afraid of ill News when I am visited by any of my old Friends. These Patrons are a little like some fine Gentlemen, who spend all their Hours of Gaiety with their Wenches, but when they fall sick, will let no one come near them but their Wives. It seems, Truth and Honour
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>
are Companions too sober for Prosperity. It is certainly the most black Ingratitude to accept of a Man's best Endeavours to be pleasing to you, and return it with Indifference.</P>
<P>I am so much of this Mind, that <HI>Dick Eastcourt</HI> the Comedian, for coming one Night to our Club, tho' he laughed at us all the Time he was there, shall have our Company at his Play on <HI>Thursday.</HI> A Man of Talents is to be favoured, or never admitted. Let the ordinary World truck for Money and Wares, but Men of Spirit and Conversation should in every Kind do others as much Pleasure as they receive from them. But Men are so taken up with outward Forms, that they do not consider their Actions; else how should it be, that a Man shall deny that to the Entreaties and almost Tears of an old Friend, which he shall solicit a new one to accept of? I remember, when I first came out of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> I had an Intimacy with a Man of Quality, in whose Gift there fell a very good Employment. All the Town cry'd, There's a Thing for Mr. <HI>Bick∣erstaff!</HI> When, to my great Astonishment, I found my Patron had been forced upon Twenty Artifices to surprize a Man with it who never thought of it: But sure it is a Degree of Murder to amuse Men with vain Hopes. If a Man takes away another's Life, where is the Difference, whether he does it by taking away the Minutes of his Time, or the Drops of his Blood? But in∣deed, such as have Hearts barren of Kindness are served accordingly by those whom they employ, and pass their Lives away with an empty Shew of Civility for Love, and an insipid Intercourse of a Commerce in which their Affections are no way concerned. But on the other Side, How beauti∣ful is the Life of a Patron who performs his Du∣ty to his Inferiors? A worthy Merchant, who employs a Crowd of Artificers? A great Lord, who is generous and merciful to the several Ne∣cessities
<PB N="33" REF="43"/>
of his Tenants? A Courtier, who uses his Credit and Power for the Welfare of his Friends? These have in their several Stations a quick Relish of the exquisite Pleasure of doing Good. In a Word, good Patrons are like the Guardian Angels of <HI>Plato,</HI> who are ever busy, though unseen, in the Care of their Wards; but ill Patrons are like the Deities of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> su∣pine, indolent, and unconcerned, though they see Mortals in Storms and Tempests even while they are offering Incense to their Power.</P>

<P>WHEN I came hither this Evening, the Man of the House delivered me a Book very finely bound. When I received it, I over∣heard one of the Boys whisper another, and say, It was a fine Thing to be a great Scholar! What a pretty Book that is! It has indeed a very gay Outside, and is dedicated to me by a very inge∣nious Gentleman, who does not put his Name to it. The Title of it (for the Work is in <HI>Latin</HI>) is, <HI>Epistolarum Obscurorum Virorum, ad Dm. M. Or∣tuinum Gratium, Volumina</HI> II. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> "The Epi∣stles of the Obscure Writers to <HI>Ortuinus, &amp;c.</HI>" The Purpose of the Work is signified in the Dedi∣cation, in very elegant Language, and fine Rail∣lery. It seems, this is a Collection of Letters which some profound Blockheads, who lived be∣fore our Times, have written in Honour of each
<PB N="34" REF="44"/>
other, and for their mutual Information in each others Absurdities. They are mostly of the <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Nation, whence from Time to Time Inun∣dations of Writers have flow'd, more pernicious to the Learned World than the Swarms of <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> to the Politick. It is, methinks, wonderful, that Fellows could be awake, and utter such incoherent Conceptions, and converse with great Gravity like learned Men, without the least Tast of Knowledge or good Sense. It would have been an endless Labour to have ta∣ken any other Method of exposing such Imperti∣nencies, than by an Edition of their own Works, where you see their Follies, according to the Am∣bition of such Virtuosi, in a most correct Edition.</P>
<P>Looking over these accomplish'd Labours, I could not but reflect upon the immense Load of Writings which the Commonalty of Scholars have pushed into the World, and the Absurdity of Parents, who educate Crowds to spend their Time in Pursuit of such cold and sprightless En∣deavours to appear in Publick. It seems there∣fore a fruitless Labour to attempt the Correction of the Tast of our Contemporaries, except it was in our Power to burn all the senseless La∣bours of our Ancestors. There is a secret Pro∣pensity in Nature from Generation to Generation in the Blockheads of one Age to admire those of another; and Men of the same Imperfections are as great Admirers of each other, as those of the same Abilities.</P>
<P>This great Mischief of voluminous Follies pro∣ceeds from a Misfortune which happens in all Ages, that Men of barren Genius's, but fertile Imaginations, are bred Scholars. This may at first appear a Paradox; but when we consider the talking Creatures we meet in publick Places, it will no longer be such. <HI>Ralph Shallow</HI> is a young Fellow, that has not by Nature any the least Pro∣pensity to strike into what has not been observed
<PB N="35" REF="45"/>
and said every Day of his Life by others; but with that Inability of speaking any Thing that is uncommon, he has a great Readiness at what he can speak of, and his Imagination runs into all the different Views of the Subject he treats of in a Moment. If <HI>Ralph</HI> had Learning added to the common Chit-Chat of the Town, he would have been a Disputant upon all Topicks that ever were considered by Men of his own Genius. As for my Part, I never am teazed by an empty Town-Fellow, but I bless my Stars that he was not bred a Scholar. This Addition, we must consider, would have made him capable of maintaining his Follies. His being in the Wrong would have been protected by suitable Arguments; and when he was hedged in by Logical Terms, and false Appearances, you must have owned your self convinced before you could then have got rid of him, and the Shame of his Triumph had been ad∣ded to the Pain of his Impertinence.</P>
<P>There is a Sort of Littleness in the Minds of Men of wrong Sense, which makes them much more insufferable than meer Fools, and has the further Inconvenience of being attended by an endless Loquacity. For which Reason, it would be a very proper Work, if some Well-wisher to humane Society would consider the Terms upon which People meet in publick Places, in order to prevent the unseasonable Declamations which we meet with there. I remember, in my Youth it was an Humour at the University, when a Fel∣low pretended to be more eloquent than ordinary, and had formed to himself a Plot to gain all our Admiration, or triumph over us with an Argu∣ment, to either of which he had no Manner of Call; I say, in either of these Cases, it was the Humour to shut one Eye. This whimsical Way of taking Notice to him of his Absurdity, has prevented many a Man from being a Coxcomb. If amongst us, on such an Occasion each Man of∣fered
<PB N="36" REF="46"/>
a voluntary Rhetorician some Snuff, it would probably produce the same Effect. As the Matter now stands, whether a Man will or no, he is obliged to be informed in whatever another pleases to entertain him with, tho' the Preceptor makes these Advances out of Vanity, and not to instruct, but insult him.</P>
<P>There is no Man will allow him who wants Courage to be called a Soldier; but Men who want good Sense, are very frequently not only al∣lowed to be Scholars, but esteemed for being such. At the same Time it must be granted, that as Courage is the natural Parts of a Soldier, so is a good Understanding of a Scholar. Such little Minds as these, whose Productions are collected in the Volume to which I have the Honour to be Patron, are the Instruments for artful Men to work with, and become popular with the un∣thinking Part of Mankind. In Courts, they make transparent Flatterers; in Camps, ostentatious Bullies; in Colleges, unintelligible Pedants; and their Faculties are used accordingly by those who lead them.</P>
<P>When a Man who wants Judgment is admitted into the Conversation of reasonable Men, he shall remember such improper Circumstances, and draw such groundless Conclusions from their Discourse, and that with such Colour of Sense, as would divide the best Set of Company that can be got together. It is just thus with a Fool who has a Familiarity with Books, he shall quote and recite one Author against another, in such a Man∣ner as shall puzzle the best Understanding to re∣fute him; tho' the most ordinary Capacity may ob∣serve, that it is only Ignorance which makes the Intricacy. All the true Use of that we call Learn∣ing, is to ennoble and improve our natural Fa∣culties, and not to disguise our Imperfections. It is therefore in vain for Folly to attempt to conceal it self by the Refuge of Learned Languages. Li∣terature
<PB N="37" REF="47"/>
does but make a Man more eminently the Thing which Nature made him; and <HI>Poly∣glottes,</HI> had he studied less than he has, and writ only in his Mother Tongue, had been known on∣ly in <HI>Great Britain</HI> for a Pedant.</P>

<HEAD>The History of <HI>Caelia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not necessary to look back into the First Years of this young Lady, whose Story is of Consequence only as her Life has lately met with Passages very uncommon. She is now in the Twentieth Year of her Age, and owes a strict, but chearful Education, to the Care of an Aunt, to whom she was recommended by her dying Fa∣ther, whose Decease was hastened by an incon∣solable Affliction for the Loss of her Mother. As <HI>Caelia</HI> is the Offspring of the most generous Pas∣sion that has been known in our Age, she is adorned with as much Beauty and Grace as the most celebrated of her Sex possess; but her Do∣mestick Life, moderate Fortune, and religious Educaiton, gave her but little Opportunity, and less Inclination, to be admired in publick Assem∣blies. Her Abode has been for some Years a con∣venient Distance from the Cathedral of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s,
<PB N="38" REF="48"/>
where her Aunt and she chose to reside, for the Advantage of that rapturous Way of Devotion which gives Extasy to the Pleasures of Innocence, and, in some Measure, is the immediate Posses∣sion of those Heavenly Enjoyments for which they are addressed.</P>
<P>As you may trace the usual Thoughts of Men in their Countenances, there appeared in the Face of <HI>Caelia</HI> a Chearfulness, the constant Companion of unaffected Virtue; and a Gladness, which is as inseparable from true Piety. Her every Look and Motion spoke the peaceful, mild, resigning, humble Inhabitant, that animated her beauteous Body. Her Air discovered her Body a meer Ma∣chine of her Mind, and not that her Thoughts were employed in studying Graces and Attractions for her Person. Such was <HI>Caelia</HI> when she was first seen by <HI>Palamede</HI> at her usual Place of Wor∣ship. <HI>Palamede</HI> is a young Man of Two and twenty, well-fashioned, learned, genteel, and dis∣creet, the Son and Heir of a Gentleman of a very great Estate, and himself possessed of a plenti∣ful one by the Gift of an Unkle. He became enamoured with <HI>Caelia,</HI> and after having learned her Habitation, had Address enough to commu∣nicate his Passion and Circumstances with such an Air of good Sense and Integrity, as soon obtain'd Permission to visit and profess his Inclinations to∣wards her. <HI>Palamede</HI>'s present Fortune and fu∣ture Expectations were no Way prejudicial to his Addresses; but after the Lovers had passed some Time in the agreeable Entertainments of a suc∣cessful Courtship, <HI>Caelia</HI> one Day took Occasion to interrupt <HI>Palamede</HI> in the Midst of a very plea∣sing Discourse of the Happiness he promised him∣self in so accomplished a Companion, and as∣suming a serious Air, told him, there was another Heart to be won before he gained hers, which was that of his Father. <HI>Palamede</HI> seemed much disturbed at the Overture, and lamented to her,
<PB N="39" REF="49"/>
That his Father was one of those too provident Pa∣rents, who only place their Thoughts upon bring∣ing Riches into their Families by Marriages, and are wholly insensible of all other Considerations. But the Strictness of <HI>Caelia</HI>'s Rules of Life made her insist upon this Demand; and the Son, at a proper Hour, communicated to his Father the Circumstances of his Love, and the Merit of the Object. The next Day the Father made her a Visit. The Beauty of her Person, the Fame of her Virtue, and a certain irresistible Charm in her whole Behaviour on so tender and delicate an Oc∣casion, wrought so much upon him, in Spight of all Prepossessions, that he hastened the Marriage with an Impatience equal to that of his Son. Their Nuptials were celebrated with a Privacy suitable to the Character and Modesty of <HI>Caelia,</HI> and from that Day, till a fatal one of last Week, they lived together with all the Joy and Happi∣ness which attend Minds entirely united.</P>
<P>It should have been intimated, That <HI>Palamede</HI> is a Student of the <HI>Temple,</HI> and usually retired thi∣ther early in a Morning, <HI>Caelia</HI> still sleeping.</P>
<P>It happened a few Days since, that she followed him thither to communicate to him something she had omitted in her redundant Fondness to speak of the Evening before. When she came to his Apart∣ment, the Servant there told her, she was coming with a Letter to her. While <HI>Caelia</HI> in an Inner Room was reading an Apology from her Husband, That he had been suddenly taken by some of his Acquaintance to dine at <HI>Brentford,</HI> but that he should return in the Evening, a Country Girl, de∣cently clad, asked, If those were not the Cham∣bers of Mr. <HI>Palamede?</HI> She was answered, They were, but that he was not in Town. The Stranger asked, When he was expected at Home? The Ser∣vant replied, She would go in and ask his Wife. The young Woman repeated the Word Wife, and fainted. This Accident rais'd no less Curiosity
<PB N="40" REF="50"/>
when Amazement in <HI>Caelia,</HI> who caused her to be removed into the Inner Room. Upon proper Ap∣plications to revive her, the unhappy young Crea∣ture returned to her self, and said to <HI>Caelia,</HI> with an earnest and beseeching Tone, Are you really Mr. <HI>Palamede</HI>'s Wife? <HI>Caelia</HI> replies, I hope I do not look as if I were any other in the Condition you see me. The Stranger answers, No, Madam, he is my Husband. At the same Instant she threw a Bundle of Letters into <HI>Caelia</HI>'s Lap, which con∣firmed the Truth of what she asserted. Their mu∣tual Innocence and Sorrow made them look at each other as Partners in Distress, rather than Rivals in Love. The Superiority of <HI>Caelia</HI>'s Un∣derstanding and Genius gave her an Authority to examine into this Adventure as if she had been offended against, and the other the Delinquent. The Stranger spoke in the following Manner:</P>
<Q>Madam,
<P>If it shall please you, Mr. <HI>Palamede</HI> having an Unkle of a good Estate near <HI>Winchester,</HI> was bred at the School there, to gain the more his good Will by being in his Sight. His Unkle died, and left him the Estate, which my Husband now has. When he was a meer Youth he set his Affections on me; but when he could not gain his Ends he married me, making me and my Mother, who is a Farmer's Widow, swear we would never tell it upon any Account whatsoever; for that it would not look well for him to marry such a one as me; besides, that his Father would cut him off of the Estate. I was glad to have him in an honest Way, and he now and then came and stay'd a Night and away at our House. But very lately he came down to see us, with a fine young Gentleman his Friend, who stay'd behind there with us, pretending to like the Place for the Summer; but ever since Master <HI>Palamede</HI> went, he has attempted to abuse me;
<PB N="41" REF="51"/>
and I ran hither to acquaint him with it, and avoid the wicked Intentions of his false Friend.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Caelia</HI> had no more Room for Doubt, but left her Rival in the same Agonies she felt her self. <HI>Palamede</HI> returns in the Evening, and finding his Wife at his Chambers, learned all that had pas∣sed, and hastened to <HI>Caelia</HI>'s Lodgings.</P>
<P>It is much easier to imagine than express the Sentiments of either the Criminal or the Injured at this Encounter.</P>
<P>Assoon as <HI>Palamede</HI> had found Way for Speech, he confessed his Marriage, and his placing his Companion on Purpose to vitiate his Wife, that he might break through a Marriage made in his Nonage, and devote his riper and knowing Years to <HI>Caelia.</HI> She made him no Answer; but retired to her Closet. He returned to the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he soon after received from her the following Letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU, who this Morning were the best, are now the worst of Men who beath vital Air. I am at once overwhelmed with Love, Hatred, Rage, and Disdain. Can Infamy and Innocence live to∣gether? I feel the Weight of the one too strong for the Comfort of the other. How bitter, Heaven, how bitter is my Portion? How much have I to say; but the Infant which I bear about me stirs with my Agitation. I am, <HI>Palamede,</HI> to live in Shame, and this Creature be Heir to it. Farewel for ever.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<P>WHEN we revolve in our Thoughts such Catastrophes as that in the History of the unhappy <HI>Caelia,</HI> there seems to be something so hazardous in the changing a single State of Life into that of Marriage, that (it may happen) all the Precautions imaginable are not sufficient to defend a Virgin from Ruin by her Choice. It seems a wonderful Inconsistence in the Distribu∣tion of publick Justice, that a Man who robs a Woman of an Ear-ring or a Jewel, should be pu∣nished with Death; but one who by false Arts and Insinuations should take from her her very self, is only to suffer Disgrace. This excellent young Woman has nothing to consolate her self with, but the Reflection that her Sufferings are not the Effect of any Guilt or Misconduct, and has for her Protection the Influence of a Power which, amidst the unjust Reproach of all Mankind, can give not only Patience, but Pleasure to Innocence in Distress.</P>
<P>As the Person who is the Criminal against <HI>Caelia</HI> cannot be sufficiently punished according to our present Law, so are there numberless unhappy Persons without Remedy according to present Custom. That great Ill which has prevailed a∣mong us in these latter Ages, is the making even Beauty and Virtue the Purchase of Money. The Generality of Parents, and some of those of Qua∣lity, instead of looking out for introducing Health of Constitution, Frankness of Spirit, or Dignity of Countenance, into their Families, lay out all their Thoughts upon finding out Marches for their Estates, and not their Children. You shall have
<PB N="43" REF="53"/>
one form a Plot for the Good of his Family, that there shall not be Six Men in <HI>England</HI> capable of pretending to his Daughter. A Second shall have a Son obliged, out of meer Discretion, for fear of doing any Thing below himself, follow all the Drabs in Town. These sage Parents meet; and as there is no Pass, no Courtship, between the young Ones, it is no unpleasant Observation to behold how they proceed to Treaty. There is ever in the Behaviour of each something that denotes his Cir∣cumstance; and honest <HI>Coupler</HI> the Conveniencer says, he can distinguish upon Sight of the Parties, before they have opened any Point of their Busi∣ness, which of the Two has the Daughter to sell. <HI>Coupler</HI> is of our Club, and I have frequently heard him declaim upon this Subject, and assert, that the Marriage-Settlements which are now used have grown fashionable even within his Memory.</P>
<P>When the Theatre in some late Reigns owed its chief Support to those Scenes which were written to put Matrimony out of Countenance, and render that State terrible, then was it that Pin-Money first prevailed, and all the other Articles inserted which create a Diffidence; and intimate to the young People, that they are very soon to be in a State of War with each other: Tho' this had sel∣dom happened, except the Fear of it had been ex∣pressed. <HI>Coupler</HI> will tell you also, that Jointures were never frequent till the Age before his own; but the Women were contented with the Third Part of the Estate the Law allotted them, and scorned to engage with Men whom they thought capable of abusing their Children. He has also in∣formed me, that those who were the oldest Bench∣ers when he came to the <HI>Temple</HI> told him, the first Marriage-Settlement of considerable Length was the Invention of an old Serjeant, who took the Opportunity of Two Testy Fathers, who were ever squabbling to bring about an Alliance be∣tween their Children. These Fellows knew each
<PB N="44" REF="54"/>
other to be Knaves, and the Serjeant took hold of their mutual Diffidence, for the Benefit of the Law, to extend the Settlement to Three Skins of Parchment.</P>
<P>To this great Benefactor to the Profession is ow∣ing the present Price Current of Lines and Words. Thus is Tenderness thrown out of the Question; and the great Care is, What the young Couple shall do when they come to hate each other? I do not question but from this one Humour of Settle∣ments, might very fairly be deduced not only our present Defection in Point of Morals, but also our Want of People. This has given Way to such un∣reasonable Gallantries, that a Man is hardly re∣proachable that deceives an innocent Woman, tho' she has never so much Merit, if she is below him in Fortune. The Man has no Dishonour fol∣lowing his Treachery; and her own Sex are so debased by Force of Custom, as to say in the Case of the Woman, How could she expect he would marry her?</P>
<P>By this Means the good Offices, the Pleasures and Graces of Life, are not put into the Ballance: The Bridegroom has given his Estate out of him∣self and he has no more left but to follow the blind Decree of his Fate, whether he shall be succeeded by a Sot, or a Man of Merit, in his Fortune. On the other Side, a fine Woman, who has also a Fortune, is set up by Way of Auction; her first Lover has Ten to One against him. The very Hour after he has opened his Heart and his Rent-Roll, he is made no other Use of, but to raise her Price. She and her Friends lose no Opportunity of pub∣lishing it to call in new Bidders. While the poor Lover very innocently waits till the Plenipoten∣tiaries at the Inns of Court have debated about the Alliance, all the Partisans of the Lady throw Difficulties in the Way, till other Offers come in; and the Man who came first is not put in Posses∣sion, till she has been refused by half the Town.

If an Abhorrence to such mercenary Proceedings were well settled in the Minds of my Fair Read∣ers, those of Merit would have a Way opened to their Advancement: nay, those who abound in Wealth only, would in Reality find their Account in it. It would not be in the Power of their Prude Acquaintance, their Waiters, their Nurses, Cousins and Whisperers, to perswade them, that there are not above Twenty Men in a Kingdom, (and those such as perhaps they may never set Eyes on) whom they can think of with Discre∣tion. As the Case stands now, let any one consi∣der, how the great Heiresses, and those to whom they were offered, for no other Reason but that they could make them suitable Settlements, live together. What can be more insipid, if not loath∣some, than for Two Persons to be at the Head of a Crowd, who have as little Regard for them as they for each other, and behold one another in an affected Sense of Prosperity, without the least Re∣lish of that exquisite Gladness at meeting, that sweet Inquietude at parting, together with the Charms of Voice, Look, Gesture, and that general Benevolence between well chosen Lovers, which makes all Things please, and leaves not the least Trifle indifferent.</P>
<P>But I am diverted from these Sketches for fu∣ture Essays, in Behalf of my numerous Clients of the Fair Sex, by a Notice sent to my Office in <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> That a blooming Widow, in the Third Year of her Widowhood, and Twenty six of her Age, designs to take a Colonel of Twenty eight.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU can't think it strange if I, who know little of the World, apply to you for Ad∣vice in the weighty Affair of Matrimony, since you your self have often declared it to be of that Consequence as to require the utmost Delibera∣tion. Without farther Preface therefore, give me Leave to tell you, that my Father at his Death left me a Fortune sufficient to make me a March for any Gentleman. My Mother (for she is still alive (is very pressing with me to marry; and I am apt to think, to gratify her, I shall venture upon One of Two Gentlemen who at this Time make their Addresses to me. My Request is, that you would direct me in my Choice; which that you may the better do, I shall give you their Characters; and to avoid Confusion, desire you to call them by the Names of <HI>Philander</HI> and <HI>Sil∣vius.</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="57"/>
<HI>Philander</HI> is young, and has a good Estate; <HI>Silvius</HI> is as young, and has a better. The for∣mer has had a liberal Education, has seen the Town, is retired from thence to his Estate in the Country, is a Man of few Words, and much gi∣ven to Books. The latter was brought up un∣der his Father's Eye, who gave him just Learn∣ing enough to enable him to keep his Accounts; but made him withal very expert in Country Business, such as Ploughing, Sowing, Buying, Selling, and the like. They are both very so∣ber Men, neither of their Persons is disagreea∣able, nor did I know which to prefer till I had heard them discourse; when the Conversation of <HI>Philander</HI> so much prevailed, as to give him the Advantage, with me, in all other Respects. My Mother pleads strongly for <HI>Silvius,</HI> and uses these Arguments, That he not only has the lar∣ger Estate at present, but by his good Husban∣dry and Management increases it daily; That his little Knowledge in other Affairs will make him easy and tractable; whereas (according to her) Men of Letters know too much to make good Husbands. To Part of this I ima∣gine I answer effectually, by saying, <HI>Philander</HI>'s Estate is large enough; That they who think 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year sufficient, make no Difference be∣tween that and Three. I easily believe him less conversant in those Affairs, the Knowledge of which she so much commends in <HI>Silvius;</HI> but I think them neither so necessary or becoming in a Gentleman as the Accomplishments of <HI>Philander.</HI> It is no great Character of a Man to say, He rides in his Coach and Six, and understands as much as he who follows his Plough. Add to this, That the Conversation of these Sort of Men seems so disagreeable to me, that tho' they may make good Bailiffs, I can hardly be perswaded they can be good Companions. 'Tis possible I may seem to have odd Notions, when I say I am
<PB N="48" REF="58"/>
not fond of a Man only for being of (what is called) a Thriving Temper. To conclude, I own I am at a Loss to conceive how good Sense should make a Man an ill Husband, or conversing with Books less complaisant.</P>

<P>The Resolution which this Lady is going to take, she may very well say is founded on Rea∣son: For after the Necessities of Life are served, there is no manner of Competition between a Man of Liberal Education and an Illiterate. Men are not altered by their Circumstances, but as they give them Opportunities of exerting what they are in themselves; and a powerful Clown is a Tyrant in the most ugly Form he can possibly appear. There lies a seeming Objection in the thoughtful Manner of <HI>Philander:</HI> But let her consider which she shall oftener have Occasion to wish, that <HI>Philander</HI> would speak, or <HI>Silvius</HI> hold his Tongue.</P>

<P>IT has been often asserted in these Papers, That the great Source of our wrong Pursuits is the impertinent Manner with which we treat Women, both in the common and important Circumstan∣ces of Life. In vain do we say, the whole Sex would run into <HI>England,</HI> while the Privileges which are allowed them, do no way ballance the
<PB N="51" REF="61"/>
Inconveniencies arising from those very Immuni∣ties. Our Women have very much indulged to them in the Participation of our Fortunes and our Liberty; but the Errors they commit in the Use of either, are by no means so impartially consi∣dered, as the false Steps which are made by Men. In the Commerce of Lovers, the Man makes the Address, assails, and betrays, and yet stands in the same Degree of Acceptance as he was in before he committed that Treachery: The Woman, for no other Crime but believing one whom she thought loved her, is treated with Shiness and In∣difference at the best, and commonly with Re∣proach and Scorn. He that is past the Power of Beauty, may talk of this Matter with the same Unconcern as of any other Subject: Therefore I shall take upon me to consider the Sex, as they live within Rules, and as they transgress them. The ordinary Class of the Good or the Ill have very little Influence upon the Actions of others; but the Eminent in either Kind are those who lead the World below them. The Ill are employed in communicating Scandal, Infamy, and Disease, like Furies; the Good distribute Benevolence, Friend∣ship, and Health, like Angels. The Ill are damped with Pain and Anguish at the Sight of all that is laudable, lovely, or happy. The Virtuous are touched with Commiseration toward the Guilty, the Disagreeable, and the Wretched. There are those who betray the Innocent of their own Sex, and sollicit the Lewd of ours. There are those who have abandoned the very Memory, not only of Innocence, but Shame. There are those who never forgave, nor could ever bear being forgi∣ven. There are also who visit the Beds of the Sick, lull the Cares of the Sorrowful, and double the Joys of the Joyful. Such is the destroying Fiend, such the Guardian Angel, Woman.</P>

<P>Before I withdraw from Business for the Night, it is my Custom to receive all Addresses to me, that others may go to Rest as well as my self, at least as far as I can contribute to it. When I cal∣led to know if any would speak with me, I was informed that Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> the Player, desired to be admitted. He was so, and with much Modesty acquainted me, as he did other People of Note, that <HI>Hamlet</HI> was to be acted on <HI>Wednesday</HI> next for his Benefit. I had long wanted to speak with this Person, because I thought I could admonish him of many Things which would tend to his Improvement. In the General I observed to him, That though Action was his Business, the Way to that Action was not to study Gesture, for the Behaviour would follow the Sentiments of the Mind.</P>
<P>Action to the Player, is what Speech is to an Orator. If the Matter be well conceived, Words will flow with Ease: And if the Actor is well possessed of the Nature of his Part, a proper Action will necessarily follow. He informed me, That <HI>Wilks</HI> was to act <HI>Hamlet,</HI> I desired him, to request of him in my Name, That he would wholly for∣get Mr. <HI>Betterton;</HI> for that he failed in no Part of <HI>Othello,</HI> but where he had him in View. An Actor's forming himself by the Carriage of ano∣ther, is like the Trick among the Widows, who lament their Husbands as their Neighbours did theirs, and not according to their own Sentiments of the Deceased.</P>
<P>There is a Fault also in the Audience which in∣terrupts their Satisfaction very much, that is, the figuring to themselves the Actor in some Part wherein they formerly particularly liked him, and not attending to the Part he is at that Time performing. Thus, whatever <HI>Wilks,</HI> (who is
<PB N="54" REF="64"/>
the strictest Follower of Nature) is acting, the vulgar Spectators turn their Thoughts upon Sir <HI>Harry Wildair.</HI> When I had indulged the Lo∣quacity of an old Man for some Time in such loose Hints, I took my Leave of Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> and was told, Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> of St. <HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-house would speak with me. His Business was to desire I would, as I am an Astrologer, let him know be∣fore-hand who were to have the Benefit-Tickets in the ensuing Lottery; which Knowledge he was of Opinion he could turn to great Account, as he was concerned in News.</P>
<P>I granted his Request, upon an Oath of Secrecy, That he would only make his own Use of it, and not let it be publickly known till after they were drawn. I had not done speaking, when he pro∣duced to me a Plan which he had formed of keep∣ing Books, with the Names of all such Adventu∣rers, and the Numbers of their Tickets, as should come to him, in order to give an Hourly Account of what Tickets shall come up during the whole Time of the Lottery, the Drawing of which is to begin on <HI>Wednesday</HI> next. I liked his Method of disguising the Secret I had told him, and pronoun∣ced him a thriving Man who could so well watch the Motion of Things, and profit by a prevailing Humour and Impatience so aptly, as to make his honest Industry agreeable to his Customers, as it is to be the Messenger of their good Fortune.</P>

<P>THIS Afternoon I went to visit a Gentleman of my Acquaintance at <HI>Mile-End,</HI> and passing through <HI>Stepney</HI> Church-yard, I could not for∣bear entertaining my self with the Inscriptions on the Tombs and Graves. Among others, I ob∣served one with this notable Memorial:</P>
<Q>Here lies the Body of T. B.</Q>
<P>This fantastical Desire of being remembered only by the Two first Letters of a Name, led me into the Contemplation of the Vanity and imperfect Attainments of Ambition in general. When I run back in my Imagination all the Men whom I have ever known and conversed with in my whole Life, there are but very few who have not used their Faculties in the Pursuit of what it is impossible to acquire, or left the Possession of what they might have been (at their setting out) Masters, to search for it where it was out of their Reach. In this Thought it was not possible to
<PB N="56" REF="66"/>
forget the Instance of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> who proposing to himself in Discourse with a Philosopher, one, and another, and another Conquest, was asked, What he would do after all that? Then, says the King, we will make merry. He was well an∣swered, What hinders your doing that in the Con∣dition you are already? The restless Desire of ex∣erting themselves above the common Level of Mankind is not to be resisted in some Tempers; and Minds of this Make may be observed in every Condition of Life. Where such Men do not make to themselves or meet with Employment, the Soil of their Constitution runs into Tares and Weeds. An old Friend of mine, who lost a Ma∣jor's Post Forty Years ago, and quitted, has ever since studied Maps, Encampments, Retreats, and Countermarches, with no other Design but to feed his Spleen and Ill-Humour, and furnish him∣self with Matter for arguing against all the suc∣cessful Actions of others. He that at his first set∣ting out in the World was the gayest Man in our Regiment, ventured his Life with Alacrity, and enjoyed it with Satisfaction, encouraged Men below him, and was courted by Men above him, has been ever since the most froward Crea∣ture breathing. His warm Complexion spends it self now only in a general Spirit of Contradiction; for which he watches all Occasions, and is in his Conversation still upon Sentry, treats all Men like Enemies, with every other Impertinence of a speculative Warrior.</P>
<P>He that observes in himself this natural Inquie∣tude, should take all imaginable Care to put his Mind in some Method of Gratification, or he will soon find himself grow into the Condition of this disappointed Major. Instead of courting proper Occasions to rise above others, he will be ever studious of pulling others down to him: It being the common Refuge of disappointed Ambition, to ease themselves by Detraction. It would
<PB N="57" REF="67"/>
be no great Argument against Ambition, that there are such mortal Things in the Disap∣pointment of it; but it certainly is a forcible Ex∣ception, that there can be no solid Happiness in the Success of it. If we value popular Praise, it is in the Power of the meanest of the People to disturb us by Calumny. If the Fame of being happy, we cannot look into a Village but we see Crowds in actual Possession of what we seek only the Appearance. To this may be added, that there is I know not what Malignity in the Minds of ordinary Men to oppose you in what they see you fond of; and it is a certain Exception against a Man's receiving Applause, that he visibly courts it. However this is not only the Passion of great and undertaking Spirts, but you see it in the Lives of such as one would believe were far enough re∣moved from the Ways of Ambition. The Rural Squires of this Nation even eat and drink out of Vanity. A vain-glorious Fox-hunter shall enter∣tain half a County for the Ostentation of his Beef and Beer, without the least Affection for any of the Crowd about him. He feeds them, because he thinks it a Superiority over them that he does so; and they devour him, because they know he treats them out of Insolence. This in∣deed is Ambition in Grotesque, but may figure to us the Condition of politer Men, whose only Pur∣suit is Glory. When the Superior acts out of a Principle of Vanity, the Dependant will be sure to allow it him; because he knows it destructive of the very Applause which is courted by the Man who favours him, and consequently makes him nearer himself.</P>
<P>But as every Man living has more or less of this Incentive, which makes Men impatient of an unactive Condition, and urges Men to attempt what may tend to their Reputation, it is abso∣lutely necessary they should form to themselves an Ambition which is in every Man's Power to
<PB N="58" REF="68"/>
gratify. This Ambition would be independent, and would consist only in acting what to a Man's own Mind appears most great and laudable. It is a Pursuit in the Power of every Man, and is on∣ly a regular Prosecution of what he himself ap∣proves. It is what can be interrupted by no out∣ward Accidents, for no Man can be robbed of his good Intention. One of our Society of the <HI>Trum∣pet</HI> therefore started last Night a Notion which I thought had Reason in it. It is, methinks, said he, an unreasonable Thing, that Heroick Virtue should (as it seems to be at present) be confined to a certain Order of Men, and be attainable by none but those whom Fortune has elevated to the most conspicuous Stations. I would have every Thing to be esteemed as Heroick which is great and uncommon in the Circumstances in the Man who performs it. Thus there would be no Virtue in humane Life which every one of the Species would not have a Pretence to arrive at, and an Ardency to exert. Since Fortune is not in our Power, let us be as little as possible in hers. Why should it be necessary that a Man should be rich, to be generous? If we measured by the Quality, and not the Quantity, of Things, the Particulars which accompany an Action, is what should denominate it mean or great. The highest Station of humane Life is to be attained by each Man that pretends to it: For every Man can be as valiant, as generous, as wise, and as merciful, as the Faculties and Opportunities which he has from Heaven and Fortune will permit. He that can say to himself, I do as much good, and am as virtuous, as my most earnest Endea∣vours will allow me, whatever is his Station in the World, is to himself possessed of the highest Honour. If Ambition is not thus turned, it is no other than a continual Succession of Anxie∣ty and Vexation. But when it has this Cast, it invigorates the Mind, and the Consciousness of
<PB N="59" REF="69"/>
its own Worth is a Reward which it is not in the Power of Envy, Reproach, or Detraction, to take from it. Thus the Seat of solid Honour is in a Man's own Bosom, and no one can want Support who is in Possession of an honest Con∣science, but he who would suffer the Reproaches of it for other Greatness.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I was going on in my Philosophy, when Notice was brought me, that there was a great Crowd in my Antichamber, who expected Au∣dience. When they were admitted, I found they all met at my Lodgings (each coming upon the same Errand) to know whether they were of the Fortunate in the Lottery which is now ready to be drawn. I was much at a Loss how to ex∣tricate my self from their Importunity; but ob∣serving the Assembly made up of both Sexes, I signified to them, that in this Case it would ap∣pear Fortune is not blind, for all the Lots would fall upon the Wisest and the Fairest. This gave so general a Satisfaction, that the Room was soon emptied, and the Company retired with the best Air, and the most pleasing Grace, I had any where observed. Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> of St. <HI>James</HI>'s Cof∣fee-house now stood alone before me, and signi∣fied to me, he had now not only prepared his Books, but had received a very great Subscription already. His Design was, to advertise his Sub∣scribers at their respective Places of Abode, with∣in an Hour after their Number is drawn, whether it was a Blank or Benefit, if the Adventurer lives within the Bills of Mortality, if he dwells in the Country, by the next Post. I encouraged the Man in his Industry, and told him, The ready Path to good Fortune, was to believe there was no such Thing.</P>

<P>IT is natural for the Imaginations of Men, who lead their Lives in too solitary a Manner, to prey upon themselves, and form from their own Conceptions Beings and Things which have no Place in Nature. This often makes an Adept as much at a Loss when he comes into the World as a meer Savage. To avoid therefore that Inepti∣tude for Society, which is frequently the Fault of us Scholars, and has to Men of Understanding and Breeding something much more shocking and untractable than Rusticity it self, I take Care to visit all publick Solemnities, and go into Assem∣blies as often as my Studies will permit. This being therefore the first Day of the Drawing of the Lottery, I did not neglect spending a conside∣rable Time in the Crowd: But as much a Philo∣sopher as I pretend to be, I could not but look with a Sort of Veneration upon the Two Boys which received the Tickets from the Wheels, as the impartial and equal Dispensers of the For∣tunes which were to be distributed among the Crowd, who all stood expecting the same Chance. It seems at first Thought very wonderful, that one Passion should so universally have the Pre∣eminence of another in the Possession of Men's Minds as that in this Case; all in general have a secret Hope of the great Ticket: And yet Fear in another Instance, as in going into a Battle shall
<PB N="61" REF="71"/>
have so little Influence, as that though each Man believes there will be many Thousands slain, each is consident he himself shall escape. This Cer∣tainty proceeds from our Vanity; for every Man sees abundance in himself that deserves Reward, and nothing which should meet with Mortification. But of all the Adventurers that filled the Hall, there was one who stood by me, who I could not but fancy expected the Thousand Pounds <HI>per An∣num,</HI> as a meer Justice to his Parts and Industry. He had his Pencil and Table-Book, and was at the drawing of each Lot, counting how much a Man with Seven Tickets was now nearer the great Prize, by the striking out another, and ano∣ther Competitor. This Man was of the most par∣ticular Constitution I had ever observed; his Pas∣sions were so active, that he worked in the ut∣most Stretch of Hope and Fear. When one Ri∣val fell before him, you might see a short Gleam of Triumph in his Countenance, which imme∣diately vanished at the Approach of another. What added to the Particularity of this Man, was, that he every Moment cast a Look, either upon the Commissioners, the Wheels, or the Boys. I gently whispered him, and asked, When he thought the Thousand Pounds would come up? Pugh! says he, Who knows that? And then looks upon a little List of his own Tickets, which were pretty high in their Numbers, and said it would not come this Ten Days. This Fellow will have a good Chance, though not that which he has put his Heart on. The Man is me∣chanically turned, and made for getting. The Simplicity and Eagerness which he is in, argues an Attention to his Point; though what he is la∣bouring at does not in the least contribute to it. Were it not for such honest Fellows as these, the Men who govern the rest of their Species would have no Tools to work with: For the outward Show of the World is carried on by such as can∣not
<PB N="62" REF="72"/>
find out that they are doing nothing. I left my Man with great Reluctance, seeing the Care he took to observe the whole Conduct of the Persons concerned, and compute the Inequa∣lity of the Chances with his own Hands and Eyes. Dear Sir, said I, they must rise early that cheat you. Ay, said he, there's nothing like a Man's minding his Business himself. 'Tis very true, said I, The Master's Eye makes the Horse fat.</P>
<P>As it is much the greater Number who are to go without Prizes, it is but very Expedient to turn our Lecture to the forming just Sentiments on the Subject of Fortune. One said this Morn∣ing, That the Chief Lot he was consident would fall upon some Puppy; but this Gentle∣man is one of those wrong Tempers who approve only the Unhappy, and have a natural Prejudice to the Fortunate. But as it is certain that there is a great Meanness in being attacked to a Man purely for his Fortune, there is no less a Mean∣ness in disliking him for his Happiness. It is the same Perverseness under different Colours, and both these Resentments arise from meer Pride.</P>
<P>The true Greatness of Mind consists in valuing Men apart from their Circumstances, or accord∣ing to their Behaviour in them. Wealth is a Di∣stinction only in Traffick; but it must not be al∣lowed as a Recommendation in any other Parti∣cular, but only just as it is applied. It was very prettily said, That we may learn the little Value of Fortune by the Persons on whom Heaven is plea∣sed to bestow it. However, there is not a har∣der Part in Humane Life, than becoming Wealth and Greatness. He must be very well stock'd with Merit, who is not willing to draw some Superiority over his Friends from his Fortune; For it is not every Man that can entertain with
<PB N="63" REF="73"/>
the Air of a Guest, and do good Offices with the Mien of one that receives them.</P>
<P>I must confess, I cannot conceive how a Man can place himself in a Figure wherein he can so much enjoy his own Soul, and that greatest of Pleasures, the just Approbation of his own Actions, than as an Adventurer on this Occasion, to sit and see the Lots go off without Hope or Fear, perfectly unconcerned as to himself, but ta∣king Part in the good Fortune of others.</P>
<P>I will believe there are happy Tempers in be∣ing, to whom all the Good that arrives to any of their Fellow-Creatures gives a Pleasure. These live in a Course of substantial and lasting Happi∣ness, and have the Satisfaction to see all Men en∣deavour to gratify them. This State of Mind not only lets a Man into certain Enjoyments, but relieves him from as certain Anxieties. If you will not rejoice with happy Men, you must re∣pine at them. <HI>Dick Reptile</HI> alluded to this when he said, He would hate no Man out of pure Idle∣ness. As for my own Part, I look at Fortune quite in another View than the rest of the World; and, by my Knowledge in Futurity, tremble at the approaching Prize, which I see coming to a young Lady for whom I have much Tenderness; and have therefore writ her the following Let∣ter, to be sent by Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> with the Notice of her Ticket.</P>

<P>I Have been this Summer upon a Ramble to visit several Friends and Relations; which is the Reason I have left you, and our ingenious, unknown Friend of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> so long in your Error concerning the Grass-plots in my Green-house. I will not give you the Particu∣lars of my Gardiner's Conduct in the Manage∣ment of my covered Garden, but content my self with letting you know, that my little Fields within Doors, though by their Novelty they appear too extravagant to you to subsist even in a regular Imagination, are in the Effect Things that require no Conjuration. Your Correspondent may depend upon it, that under a sashed Roof, which lets in the Sun at all Times, and the Air as often as is convenient, he may have Grass-plots in the greatest Per∣fection, if he will be at the Pains to water, mow, and roll them. Grass and Herbs in ge∣neral, the less they are exposed to the Sun and Wind, the livelier is their Verdure. They re∣quire only Warmth and Moisture; and if you were to see my Plots, your Eye would soon con∣fess, that the Bowling-Green at <HI>Marybone</HI> wears not half so bright a Livery.</P>

<P>MAny are the Inconveniencies which happen from the improper Manner of Address in common Speech, between Persons of the same or of different Quality. Among these Errors, there is none greater than that of the imperti∣nent Use of Title, and a paraphrastical Way of saying, You. I had the Curiosity the other Day to follow a Crowd of People near <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> who were conducting a passionate Woman who sold Fish to a Magistrate, in order to explain some Words which were ill taken by one of her own Quality and Profession in the publick Mar∣ket. When she came to make her Defence, she was so very full of, His Worship, and of, If it should please his Honour, that we could for some Time hardly hear any other Apology she made for her self, than that of attoning for the ill Language she had been accused of towards her Neighbour by the great Civilities she paid to her Judge. But this Extravagance in her Sense of doing Honour, was no more to be wondered at, than that her many
<PB N="66" REF="76"/>
Rings on each Finger were worn as Instances of Finery and Dress. The Vulgar may thus heap and huddle Terms of Respect, and nothing bet∣ter be expected from them; but for People of Rank to repeat Appellatives insignificantly, is a Folly not to be endured, neither with Regard to our Times or our Understanding. It is below the Dignity of Speech to extend it with more Words or Phrases than are necessary to explain our selves with Elegance: And it is, methinks, an Instance of Ignorance, if not of Servitude, to be redun∣dant in such Expressions.</P>
<P>I waited upon a Man of Quality some Morn∣ings ago: He happened to be dressing; and his Shoemaker fitting him, told him, That if his Lordship would please to tread hard, or that if his Lordship would stamp a little, his Lordship would find his Lordship's Shoe will fit as easie as any Piece of Work his Lordship should see in <HI>England.</HI> As soon as my Lord was dressed, a Gentleman approached him with a very good Air, and told him, he had an Affair which had long depended in the Lower Courts, which, through the Inadvertency of his Ance∣stors on the one Side, and the ill Arts of their Ad∣versaries on the other, could not possibly be set∣tled according to the Rules of the Lower Courts: That therefore he designed to bring his Cause be∣fore the House of Lords next Session, where he should be glad if his Lordship should happen to be present; for he doubted not but his Cause would be approved by all Men of Justice and Ho∣nour. In this Place the Word Lordship was gracefully inserted, because it was applied to him in that Circumstance wherein his Quality was the Occasion of the Discourse, and wherein it was most useful to the one, and most honourable to the other.</P>
<P>This Way is so far from being disrespectful to the Honour of Nobles, that it is an Expedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="67" REF="77"/>
for using them with greater Deference. I would not put Lordship to a Man's Hat, Gloves, Wig, or Cane; but to desire his Lordship's Favour, his Lordship's Judgment, or his Lordship's Patro∣nage, is a Manner of speaking, which expresses an Alliance between his Quality and his Merit. It is this Knowledge which distinguished the Dis∣course of the Shoemaker from that of the Gen∣tleman. The highest Point of good Breeding, if any one can hit it, is to show a very nice Re∣gard to your own Dignity, and with that in your Heart express your Value for the Man above you.</P>
<P>But the silly Humour to the contrary has so much prevailed, that the slavish Addition of Title enervates Discourse, and renders the Appli∣cation of it almost ridiculous. We Writers of Diurnals are nearer in our Styles to that of com∣mon Talk than any other Writers, by which Means we use Words of Respect sometimes very unfortunately. The <HI>Post-Man,</HI> who is one of the most celebrated of our Fraternity, fell into this Misfortune Yesterday in his Paragraph from <HI>Ber∣lin</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 26. <HI>Count</HI> Wartemberg (says he) <HI>Great Chamberlain, and Chief Minister of this Court, who on</HI> Monday <HI>lest accompanied the King of</HI> Prussia <HI>to</HI> Oranienburg, <HI>was taken so very ill, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Wednesday <HI>has Life was despaired of; and we had a Report, that his Excellency was dead.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly presume, that it slattens the Narra∣tion, to say his Excellency in a Case which is common to all Men; except you would infer what is not to be inferred, to wit, That the Author designed to say, All wherein he excelled others was departed from him.</P>
<P>Were Distinctions used according to the Rules of Reason and Sense, those Additions to Men's Names would be, as they were first intended, sig∣nificant of their Worth, and not their Persons; so that in some Cases it might be proper to say,
<PB N="68" REF="78"/>
The Man is dead, but his Excellency will never die. It is, methinks, very unjust to laugh at a Quaker, because he has taken up a Resolution to treat you with a Word, the most expressive of Complaisance that can be thought of, and with an Air of good Nature and Charity calls you Friend. I say, it is very unjust to rally him for this Term to a Stranger, when you your selves, in all your Phrases of Distinction, confound Phrases of Honour into no Use at all.</P>
<P><HI>Tom. Courtly,</HI> who is the Pink of Courtesy, is an Instance of how little Moment an undistin∣guishing Application of Sounds of Honour are to those who understand themselves. <HI>Tom.</HI> never fails of paying his Obeisance to every Man he sees, who has Title or Office to make him conspicuous; but his Deference is wholly given to outward Considerations. I, who know him, can tell with∣in half an Acre how much Land one Man has more than another by <HI>Tom</HI>'s Bow to him. Title is all he knows of Honour, and Civility of Friend∣ship: For this Reason, because he cares for no Man living, he is religiously strict in performing what he calls his Respects to you. To this End he is very learned in Pedigree, and will aba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> something in the Ceremony of his Approaches to a Man, if he is in any Doubt about the bearing of his Coat of Arms.

<P>NAture has implanted in us Two very strong Desires, Hunger for the Preservation of the Individual, and Lust for the Support of the Spe∣cies; or, to speak more intelligibly, the former to continue our own Persons, and the latter to in∣troduce others into the World. According as Men behave themselves with regard to these Ap∣petites, they are above or below the Beasts of the Field, which are incited by them without Choice or Reflection. But reasonable Creatures correct these Incentives, and improve them into elegant Motives of Friendship and Society. It is chiefly from this homely Foundation, that we are under the Necessity of seeking for the agreeable Companion, and the honourable Mistress. By this Cultivation of Art and Reason, our Wants are made Pleasures, and the Gratification of our Desires, under proper Restrictions, a Work no Way below our noblest Faculties. The wisest Man may maintain his Character, and yet consi∣der in what Manner he shall best entertain his Friend, or divert his Mistress: Nay, it is so far from being a Derogation to him, that he can in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o other Instances show so true a Tast of his Life, or his Fortune. What concerns one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bove-mentioned Appetites, as it is elevated into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove, I shall have abundant Occasion to discourse
<PB N="70" REF="80"/>
of before I have provided for the numberless Crowd of Damsels I have proposed to take Care of. The Subject therefore of the present Paper shall be that Part of Society which owes its Be∣ginning to the common Necessity of Hunger. When this is considered as the Support of our Be∣ing, we may take in under the same Head Thirst also; otherwise when we are pursuing the Glut∣ton, the Drunkard may make his Escape. The true Choice of our Diet, and our Companions at it, seems to consist in that which contributes most to Chearfulness and Refreshment: And these certainly are best consulted by Simplicity in the Food, and Sincerity in the Company. By this Rule are in the first Place excluded from Pretence to Happiness all Meals of State and Ceremony, which are performed in dumb Shew, and greedy Sullenness. At the Boards of the Great, they say, you shall have a Number attending with as good Habits and Countenances as the Guests, which only Circumstance must destroy the whole Plea∣sure of the Repast: For if such Attendants are introduced for the Dignity of their Appearance, modest Minds are shocked by considering them as Spectators, or else look upon them as Equals, for whose Servitude they are in a Kind of Suffering. It may be here added, that the sumptuous Side∣board to an ingenious Eye has often more the Air of an Altar than a Table. The next absurd Way of enjoying our selves at Meals, is, where the Bottle is ply'd without being called for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where Humour takes Place of Appetite, and the good Company are too dull or too merry to know any Enjoyment in their Senses.</P>
<P>Tho' this Part of Time is absolutely necessar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to sustain Life, it must be also considered, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Life it self is to the endless Being of Man b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> what a Meal is to this Life, not valuable for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> self, but for the Purposes of it. If there be an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Truth in this, the Expence of many Hours th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="71" REF="81"/>
Way is somewhat unaccountable; and placing much Thought either in too great Sumptuousness and Elegance in this Matter, or wallowing in Noise and Riot at it, are both, tho' not equally, unaccountable. I have often considered these dif∣ferent People with very great Attention, and al∣ways speak of them with the Distinction of the Eaters, and the Swallowers. The Eaters sacri∣fice all their Senses and Understanding to this Ap∣petite: The Swallowers hurry themselves out of both, without pleasing this or any other Appetite at all. The latter are improved Brutes, the for∣mer degenerated Men. I have sometimes thought it would not be improper to add to my Dead and Living Men, Persons in an intermediate State of Humanity, under the Appellation of Dozers. The Dozers are a Sect, who, instead of keeping their Appetites in Subjection, live in Subjection to them; nay, they are so truly Slaves to them, that they keep at too great a Distance ever to come into their Presence. Within my own Acquain∣tance, I know those that I dare say have forgot that they ever were hungry, and are no less utter Strangers to Thirst and Weariness, who are be∣holden to Sauces for their Food, and to their Food for their Weariness.</P>
<P>I have often wondered, confidering the excel∣lent and choice Spirits that we have among our Divines, that they do not think of putting vici∣ous Habits into a more contemptible and unlove∣ly Figure than they do at present. So many Men of Wit and Spirit as there are in Sacred Orders, have it in their Power to make the Fashion of their Side. The Leaders in humane Society are more effectu∣ally prevailed upon this Way than can easily be imagined. I have more than one in my Thoughts at this Time capable of doing this against all the Opposition of the most Witty, as well as the most Voluptuous. There may possibly be more ac∣ceptable Subjects, but sure there are none more
<PB N="72" REF="82"/>
useful. It is visible, that tho' Mens Fortunes, Circumstances, and Pleasures, give them Pre∣possessions too strong to regard any Mention ei∣ther of Punishments or Rewards, they will listen to what makes them inconsiderable or mean in the Imaginations of others, and by Degrees in their own.</P>
<P>It is certain such Topicks are to be touched up∣on in the Light we mean, only by Men of the most consummate Prudence, as well as excellent Wit: For these Discourses are to be made, if made to run into Example, before such as have their Thoughts more intent upon the Propriety than the Reason of the Discourse. What indeed leads me into this Way of Thinking, is, That the last Thing I read was a Sermon of the learn∣ed Dr. <HI>South,</HI> upon <HI>the Ways of Pleasantness.</HI> This admirable Discourse was made at Court, where the Preacher was too wise a Man not to believe, the greatest Argument, in that Place, against the Pleasures then in Vogue, must be, that they lost greater Pleasures by prosecuting the Course they were in. The Charming Discourse has in it whatever Wit and Wisdom can put together. This Gentleman has a Talent of making all his Faculties bear to the great End of his hallowed Profession. Happy Genius! He is the better Man for being a Wit. The best Way to praise this Author is to quote him; and, I think, I may de∣fy any Man to say a greater Thing of him, or his Ability, than that there are no Paragraphs in the whole Discourse I speak of below these which follow.</P>
<P>After having recommended the Satisfaction of the Mind, and the Pleasure of Conscience, he proceeds:</P>
<Q><P>An ennobling Property of it is, That it is such a Pleasure as never satiates or wearies; for it properly affects the Spirit, and a Spirit feels no Weariness, as being privileged from the
<PB N="73" REF="83"/>
Causes of it. But can the Epicure say so of any of the Pleasures he so much dotes upon? Do they not expire while they satisfy, and after a few Minutes Refreshment determine in Loath∣ing and Unquietness? How short is the Inter∣val between a Pleasure and a Burthen? How undiscernable the Transition from one to the o∣ther: Pleasure dwells no longer upon the Ap∣petie than the Necessities of Nature, which are quickly and easily provided for; and then all that follows is a Load and an Oppression. Every Morsel to a satisfied Hunger, is only a new Labour to a tired Digestion. Every Draught to him that has quenched his Thirst, is but a further quenching of Nature, and a Provision for Rheum and Diseases, a Drowning of the Quickness and Activity of the Spirits.</P>
<P>He that prolongs his Meals, and sacrifices his Time, as well as his other Conveniencies, to his Luxury, How quickly does he outsit his Plea∣sure? And then, How is all the following Time bestowed upon Ceremony and Surfeit? Till at length, after a long Fatigue of Eating, and Drinking, and Babbling, he concludes the great Work of dining genteely, and so makes a Shift to rise from Table, that he may lie down upon his Bed; where, after he has slept himself into some Use of himself, by much ado he staggers to his Table again, and there acts over the same brutish Scene: So that he passes his whole Life in a dozed Condition, between sleeping and waking, with a Kind of Drowsiness and Con∣fusion upon his Senses, which, what Pleasure it can be, is hard to conceive. All that is of it dwells upon the Tip of his Tongue, and within the Compass of his Palate. A worthy Prize for a Man to purchase with the Loss of his Time, his Reason, and himself!</P></Q>

<P>THE general Purposes of Men in the Con¦duct of their Lives, (I mean with relatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to this Life only) end in gaining either the Af¦fection or the Esteem of those with whom the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> converse.

Words and Actions tend to the Advancement of his Reputation and of his Fortune, toward which he makes hourly Progress, because he lavishes no Part of his good Will upon such as do not make some Advances to merit it. The Man who va∣lues Affection, sometimes becomes popular; he who aims at Esteem, seldom falls of growing rich.</P>
<P>Thus far we have looked at these different Men, as Persons who endeavour to be valued and be∣loved from Design, or Ambition; but they ap∣pear in quite another Figure, when you observe the Men who are agreeable and venerable from the Force of their natural Inclinations. We af∣fect the Company of him who has least Regard of himself in his Carriage, who throws himself into unguarded Gaiety, voluntary Mirth, and ge∣neral good Humour; who has nothing in his Head but the present Hour, and seems to have all his Interests and Passions gratified, if every Man else in the Room is as unconcerned as himself. This Man usually has no Quality or Character among his Companions, let him be born of whom he will, have what great Qualities he please, let him be capable of assuming for a Moment what Figures he pleases, he still dwells in the Ima∣gination of all who know him but as <HI>Jack such a One.</HI> This makes <HI>Jack</HI> brighten up the Room wherever he enters, and change the Severity of the Company into that Gaiety and good Humour into which his Conversation generally leads them. It is not unpleasant to observe even this Sort of Creature go out of his Character, to check himself sometimes for his Familiarities, and pretend so aukwardly at procuring to him∣self more esteem than he finds he meets with. I was the other Day walking with <HI>Jack Gainly</HI> to∣wards <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Walks.</HI> We met a Fellow who is a Lower Officer where <HI>Jack</HI> is in the Di∣rection. <HI>Jack</HI> cries to him, So, How is it Mr —
<PB N="76" REF="86"/>
He answers, Mr. <HI>Gainly,</HI> I am glad to see yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well. This Expression of Equality gave m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Friend a Pang, which appeared in a Flush of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Countenance. Prithee <HI>Jack,</HI> says I, do not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> angry at the Man; for do what you will, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man can only love you, be contented with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Image the Man has of thee; for if thou aimes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at any other, it must be Hatred or Contempt. I went on, and told him, Look'ee, <HI>Jack,</HI> I have heard thee sometimes talk like an Oracle for half an Hour, with the Sentiments of a <HI>Roman,</HI> the Closeness of a School-man, and the Integrity of a Divine; but then, <HI>Jack,</HI> while I admired thee, it was upon Topicks which did not concern thy self, and where the Greatness of the Subject, (ad∣ded to thy being personally unconcerned in it) created all that was great in thy Discourse. I did not mind his being a little out of Humour, but comforted him, by giving him several Instances of Men of our Acquaintance, who had no one Quality in any Eminence, that were much more esteemed than he was with very many: But the Thing is, if your Character is to give Pleasure, Men will consider you only in that Light, and not in those Acts which turn to Esteem and Ve∣neration.</P>
<P>When I think of <HI>Jack Gainly,</HI> I cannot but re∣flect also upon his Sister <HI>Gatty.</HI> She is young, witty, pleasant, innocent. This is her natural Character; but when she observes any one ad∣mired for what they call a Fine Woman, she i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the next Day womanly, prudent, observing, and virtuous. She is every Moment asked in her prudential Behaviour, Whether she is not well? Upon which she as often answers in a Fret, Do People think one must be always romping, al∣ways a Jackpudding? I never fail to enquire o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her, If my Lady such a One, that awful Beauty, was not at the Play last Night? She knows th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Connexion between that Question and her Chang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

of Humour, and says, <Q REND="inline">'It would be very well, if some People would examine into themselves as much as they do into others.'</Q> Or, <Q REND="inline">'Sure there is nothing in the World so ridiculous as an amorous old Man.'</Q></P>
<P>As I was saying, there is a Class which every Man is in by his Post in Nature, from which it is impossible for him to withdraw to another, and become it. Therefore it is necessary that each should be contented with it, and not endeavour at any Progress out of that Tract. To follow Na∣ture, is the only agreeable Course; which is what I would fain inculcate to those jarring Compa∣nions, <HI>Flavia</HI> and <HI>Lucia.</HI> They are Mother and Daughter. <HI>Flavia,</HI> who is the Mamma, has all the Charms and Desires of Youth still about her, and not much turned of Thirty: <HI>Lucia</HI> is bloom∣ing and amorous, and but a little above Fifteen. The Mother looks very much younger than she is, the Girl very much elder. If it were possible to fix the Girl to her sick Bed, and preserve the Portion (the Use of which the Mother partakes) the good Widow <HI>Flavia</HI> would certainly do it. But for fear of <HI>Lucia</HI>'s Escape, the Mother is for∣ced to be constantly attended with a Rival, that explains her Age, and draws off the Eyes of her Admirers. The Jest is, they can never be toge∣ther in Strangers Company, but <HI>Lucy</HI> is eternally reprimanded for something very particular in her Behaviour; for which she has the Malice to say, She hopes she shall always obey her Parents. She carried her Passion and Jealousy to that Height the other Day, that coming suddenly into the Room, and surprising Colonel <HI>Lofty</HI> speaking Rapture on one Knee to her Mother, she clapped down by him, and asked her Blessing.</P>
<P>I do not know whether it is so proper to tell Family Occurrences of this Nature; but we eve∣ry Day see the same Thing happen in the publick Conversation in the World. Men cannot be con∣tented
<PB N="78" REF="88"/>
with what is laudable, but they must have all that is laudable. This Affectation is what de∣stroys the familiar Man into Pretences to take State upon him, and the contrary Character to the Folly of aiming at being winning and com∣plaisant. But in these Cases, Men may easily lay aside what they are, but can never arrive at what they are not.</P>
<P>As to the Pursuits after Affection and Esteem, the Fair Sex are happy in this Particular, that with them the one is much more nearly related to the other than in Men. The Love of a Wo∣man is inseparable from some Esteem of her; and as she is naturally the Object of Affection, the Woman who has your Esteem has also some Degree of your Love. A Man that dotes on a Woman for her Beauty, will whisper his Friend, <HI>That Creature has a great deal of Wit when you are well acquainted with her.</HI> And if you examine the Bottom of your Esteem for a Woman, you will find you have a greater Opinion of her Beau∣ty than any Body else. As to us Men, I design to pass most of my Time with the facetious <HI>Harry Bickerstaff;</HI> but <HI>William Bickerstaff,</HI> the most prudent Man of our Family, shall be my Executor.</P>

<P>HAving Yesterday Morning received a Paper of <HI>Latin</HI> Verses, written with much Ele∣gance in Honour of these my Papers, and being informed at the same Time that they were com∣posed by a Youth under Age, I read them with
<PB N="79" REF="89"/>
much Delight, as an Instance of his Improve∣ment. There is not a greater Pleasure to old Age, than seeing young People entertain themselves in such a Manner as that we can partake of their Enjoyments. On such Occasions we flatter our selves, that we are not quite laid aside in the World, but that we are either used with Grati∣tude for what we were, or honoured for what we are. A well inclined young Man, and whose good Breeding is founded upon the Principles of Nature and Virtue, must needs take Delight in being agreeable to his Elders, as we are truly de∣lighted when we are not the Jest of them. When I say this, I must confess I cannot but think it a very lamentable Thing that there should be a Necessity for making that a Rule of Life, which should be, methinks, a meer Instinct of Nature. If Reflection upon a Man in Poverty, whom we once knew in Riches, is an Argument of Commi∣seration with generous Minds; sure old Age, which is a Decay from that Vigour which the Young possess, and must certainly (if not pre∣vented against their Will) arrive at, should be more forcibly the Object of that Reverence which honest Spirits are inclined to from a Sense of be∣ing themselves liable to what they observe has al∣ready overtaken others.</P>
<P>My Three Nephews, whom in <HI>June</HI> last was Twelvemonth I disposed of according to their se∣veral Capacities and Inclinations, the first to the University, the Second to a Merchant, and the Third to a Woman of Quality as her Page, by my Invitation dined with me to Day. It is my Cu∣stom often, when I have a Mind to give my self a more than ordinary Chearfulness, to invite a certain young Gentlewoman of our Neighbour∣hood to make one of the Company. She did me that Favour this Day. The Presence of a beauti∣ful Woman of Honour, to Minds which are not trivially disposed, displays an Alacrity which is
<PB N="80" REF="90"/>
not to be communicated by any other Object. It was not unpleasant to me to look into her Thoughts of the Company she was in. She smiled at the Party of Pleasure I had thought of for her, which was composed of an old Man and Three Boys. My Scholar, my Citizen, and my self, were very soon neglected; and the young Courtier, by the Bow he made to her at her En∣trance, engaged her Observation without a Rival. I observed the <HI>Oxonian</HI> not a little discomposed at this Preference, while the Trader kept his Eye upon his Unkle. My Nephew <HI>Will</HI> had a Thou∣sand secret Resolutions to break in upon the Dis∣course of his younger Brother, who gave my fair Companion a full Account of the Fashion, and what was reckoned most becoming to this Com∣plexion, and what Sort of Habit appeared best upon t'other Shape. He proceeded to acquaint her, who of Quality was well or sick within the Bills of Mortality, and named very familiarly all his Lady's Acquaintance, not forgetting her very Words when he spoke of their Characters. Be∣sides all this, he had a Road of Flattery; and up∣on her enquiring what Sort of Woman Lady <HI>Love∣ly</HI> was in her Person, Really Madam, says the Jackanapes, she is exactly of your Height and Shape; but as you are fair, she is a brown Wo∣man. There was no enduring that this Fop should outshine us all at this unmerciful Rate, therefore I thought fit to talk to my young Scho∣lar concerning his Studies; and because I would throw his Learning into present Service, I desired him to repeat to me the Translation he had made of some tender Verses in <HI>Theocritus.</HI> He did so, with an Air of Elegance peculiar to the College to which I sent him. I made some Exceptions to the Turn of the Phrases, which he defended with much Modesty, as believing in that Place the Matter was rather to consult the Softness of a Swain's Passion, than the Strength of his Expres∣sions.
<PB N="81" REF="91"/>
It soon appeared, that <HI>Will</HI> had out-strip∣ped his Brother in the Opinion of our young La∣dy. A little Poetry to one who is bred a Scholar, has the same Effect that a good Carriage of his Person has on one who is to live in Courts. The Favour of Women is so natural a Passion, that I envied both the Boys their Success in the Appro∣bation of my Guest; and I thought the only Per∣son invulnerable was my young Trader. During the whole Meal, I could observe in the Children a mutual Contempt and Scorn of each other, ari∣sing from their different Way of Life and Educa∣tion, and took that Occasion to advertise them of such growing Distasts, which might mislead them in their future Life, and disappoint their Friends, as well as themselves, of the Advantages which might be expected from the Diversity of their Professions and Interests.</P>
<P>The Prejudices which are growing up between these Brothers from the different Ways of Edu∣cation, are what create the most fatal Misunder∣standings in Life. But all Distinctions of Dispa∣ragement meerly from our Circumstances, are such as will not bear the Examination of Reason. The Courtier, the Trader, and the Scholar, should all have an equal Pretension to the Deno∣mination of a Gentleman. That Tradesman who deals with me in a Commodity which I do not understand with Uprightness, has much more Right to that Character, than the Courtier who gives me false Hopes, or the Scholar who laughs at my Ignorance.</P>
<P>The Appellation of Gentleman is never to be affixed to a Man's Circumstances, but to his Be∣haviour in them. For this Reason I shall ever, as far as I am able, give my Nephews such Im∣pressions as shall make them value themselves ra∣ther as they are useful to others, than as they are conscious of Merit in themselves. There are no Qualities from which we ought to pretend to the
<PB N="82" REF="92"/>
Esteem of others, but such as render us service∣able to them; for <HI>Free Men have no Superiors but Benefactors.</HI> I was going on like a true old Fel∣low to this Purpose to my Guests, when I recei∣ved the following Epistle:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have yours, with Notice of a Benefit-Ticket of 400 <HI>l. per Annum, both enclosed by</HI> Mr. <HI>El∣liot,</HI> who had my Numbers for that Purpose. Your Philosophick Advice came very seasonably to me with that good Fortune; but I must be so sincere with you as to acknowledge, I owe my present Moderation more to my own Folly, than your wisdom. You will think this strange till I inform you, that I had fixed my Thoughts upon the 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, and had with that Ex∣pectation laid down so many agreeable Plans for my Behaviour towards my new Lovers and old Friends, that I have received this Favour of Fortune with an Air of Disappointment. This is interpreted by all who know not the Springs of my Heart as a wonderful Piece of Humility. I hope my present State of Mind will grow in∣to that; but I confess my Conduct to be now owing to another Cause. However, I know you will approve my taking hold even of Im∣perfections to find my Way towards Virtue, which is so feeble in us at the best, that we are often beholden to our Faults for the first Ap∣pearances of it.

<P>AN old Acquaintanc who met me this Morn∣ing seemed overjoyed to see me, and told me, I looked as well as he had known me do these Forty Years: But, continued he, not quite the Man you were when we visited together at Lady <HI>Brightly</HI>'s. Oh! <HI>Isaac,</HI> those Days are over. Do you think there are any such fine Creatures now living as we then conversed with? He went on with a Thousand incoherent Circumstances, which, in his Imagination, must needs please me; but they had the quite contrary Effect. The Flat∣tery with which he began, in telling me how well I wore, was not disagreeable; but his indiscreet Mention of a Set of Acquaintance we had out∣lived, recalled Ten Thousand Things to my Me∣mory, which made me reflect upon my present Condition with Regret. Had he indeed been so kind as, after a long Absence, to felicitate me up∣on an indolent and easy old Age, and mentioned how much he and I had to thank for, who at our Time of Day could walk firmly, eat heartily, and converse chearfully, he had kept up my Pleasure in my self. But of all Mankind, there are none so shocking as these injudicious civil People. They ordinarily begin upon something that they know must be a Satisfaction; but then, for Fear of the Imputation of Flattery, they follow it with the last Thing in the World of which you would be
<PB N="84" REF="94"/>
reminded. It is this that perplexes civil Persons. The Reason that there is such a general Outcry amongst us against Flatterers, is, that there are so very few good Ones. It is the nicest Art in this Life, and is a Part of Eloquence which does not want the Preparation that is necessary to all other Parts of it, That your Audience should be your Well-wishers: For Praise from an Enemy is the most pleasing of all Commendations.</P>
<P>It is generally to be observed, that the Person most agreeable to a Man for a Constancy is he that has no shining Qualities, but is a certain Degree above great Imperfections, whom he can live with as his Inferior, and who will either overlook or not observe his little Defects. Such an easy Com∣panion as this, either now and then throws out a little Flattery, or lets a Man silently flatter him∣self in his Superiority to him. If you take No∣tice, there is hardly a rich Man in the World, who has not such a led Friend of small Considera∣tion, who is a Darling for his Insignificancy. It is a great Ease to have one in our own Shape a Species below us, and who, without being listed in our Service, is by Nature of our Retinue. These Dependants are of excellent Use on a Rainy Day, or when a Man has not a Mind to dress, or to ex∣clude Solitude, when one has neither a Mind to that or to Company. There are of this good-na∣tured Order, who are so kind as to divide them∣selves, and do these good Offices to many. Five or Six of them visit a whole Quarter of the Town, and exclude the Spleen without Fees from the Families they frequent. If they do not prescribe Physick, they can be Company when you take it. Very great Benefactors to the Rich, or those whom they call People at their Ease, are your Persons of no Consequence. I have known some of them, by the Help of a little Cunning, make delicious Flatterers. They know the Course of the Town, and the general Characters of Persons: By this
<PB N="85" REF="95"/>
Means they will sometimes tell the most agree∣able Falshoods imaginable. They will acquaint you, that such a One of a quite contrary Party said, that tho' you were engaged in different In∣terests, yet he had the greatest Respect for your good Sense and Address. When one of these has a little Cunning, he passes his Time in the ut∣most Satisfaction to himself and his Friends: For his Position is never to report or speak a displea∣sing Thing to his Friend. As for letting him go on in an Error, he knows Advice against them is the Office of Persons of greater Talents and less Discretion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Latin</HI> Word for a Flatterer <HI>(Assentator)</HI> implies no more than a Person that barely con∣sents; and indeed such a one, if a Man were able to purchase or maintain him, cannot be bought too dear. Such a one never contradicts you, but gains upon you, not by a fulsom Way of com∣mending you in broad Terms, but liking what∣ever you propose or utter; at the same Time is ready to beg your Pardon, and gainsay you, if you chance to speak Ill of your self. An old Lady is very seldom without such a Companion as this, who can recite the Names of all her Lovers, and the Matches refused by her in the Days when she minded such Vanities, (as she is pleased to call them, tho' she so much approves the Mention of them.) It is to be noted, that a Woman's Flatterer is generally older than her self, her Years serving at once to recommend her Patroness's Age, and to add Weight to her Complaisance in all other Particulars.</P>
<P>We Gentlemen of small Fortunes are extreme∣ly necessitous in this Particular. I have indeed one who smokes with me often; but his Parts are so low, that all the Incense he does me is to fill his Pipe with me, and to be out at just as many Whiffs as I take. This is all the Praise or Assent that he is capable of, yet there are more Hours when I
<PB N="86" REF="96"/>
would rather be in his Company than that of the brightest Man I know. It would be an hard Mat∣ter to give an Account of this Inclination to be flattered; but if we go to the Bottom of it, we shall find that the Pleasure in it is something like that of receiving Money which lay out. Every Man thinks he has an Estate of Reputation, and is glad to see one that will bring any of it Home to him: It is no Matter how dirty a Bag it is con∣veyed to him in, or by how clownish a Messenger, so the Money is good. All that we want to be pleased with Flattery, is to believe that the Man is sincere who gives it us. It is by this one Ac∣cident, that absurd Creatures often outrun the more Skilful in this Art. Their Want of Ability is here an Advantage, and their Bluntness, as it is the seeming Effect of Sincerity, is the best Co∣ver to Artifice.</P>
<P><HI>Terence</HI> introduces a Flatterer talking to a Cox∣comb whom he cheats out of a Livelihood, and a third Person on the Stage makes on him this plea∣sant Remark, <Q REND="inline">"This Fellow has an Art of making Fools Madmen."</Q> The Love of Flattery is in∣deed sometimes the Weakness of a great Mind; but you see it also in Persons who otherwise dis∣cover no Manner of Relish of any Thing above meer Sensuality. These latter it sometimes im∣proves, but always debases the former. A Fool is in himself the Object of Pity till he is flattered. By the Force of that his Stupidity is raised into Affectation, and he becomes of Dignity enough to be ridiculous. I remember a Drole, that upon one's saying, The Times are so ticklish that there must great Care be taken what one says in Con∣versation; answered with an Air of Surliness and Honesty, If People will be free, let them be so in the Manner that I am, who never abuse a Man but to his Face. He had no Reputation for say∣ing dangerous Truths; therefore when it was re∣peated, You abuse a Man but to his Face? Yes, says he, I flatter him.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="97"/>
It is indeed the greatest of Injuries to flatter any but the Unhappy, or such as are displeased with themselves for some Infirmity. In this latter Case we have a Member of our Club, that when Sir <HI>Jeffery</HI> falls asleep, wakens him with Snoring. This makes Sir <HI>Jeffery</HI> hold up for some Moments the longer, to see there are Men younger than himself among us, who are more Lethargick than he is.</P>
<P>When Flattery is practised upon any other Con∣sideration, it is the most abject Thing in Nature; nay, I cannot think of any Character below the Flatterer, except he that envies him. You meet with Fellows prepared to be as mean as possible in their Condescentions and Expressions; but they want Persons and Talents to rise up to such a Base∣ness. As a Coxcomb is a Fool of Parts, so is a Flatterer a Knave of Parts.</P>
<P>The best of this Order that I know, is one who disguises it under a Spirit of Contradiction or Re∣proof. He told an errant Driveler the other Day, That he did not care for being in Company with him, because he heard he turned his absent Friends into Ridicule. And upon Lady <HI>Autumn</HI>'s dispu∣ting with him about something that happened at the Revolution, he replied with a very angry Tone, Pray, Madam, give me Leave to know more of a Thing in which I was actually con∣cerned, than you who were then in your Nurse's Arms.</P>

<P>ANoble Painter, who has an Ambition to draw an History-Piece, has desired of me to give him a Subject on which he may show the utmost Force of his Art and Genius. For this Purpose I have pitched upon that remarkable Incident be∣tween <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> and his Physician. This Prince, in the Midst of his Conquests in <HI>Persia,</HI> was seized by a violent Fever; and according to the Account we have of his <HI>vast</HI> Mind, his Thoughts were more employed about his Recovery as it regarded the War, than as it concerned his own Life. He professed, a slow Method was worse than Death to him, because it was what he more dreaded, an Interruption of his Glory. He desi∣red a dangerous, so it might be a speedy Reme∣dy. During this Impatience of the King, it is well known that <HI>Darius</HI> had offered an immense Sum to any who should take away his Life. But <HI>Philippus,</HI> the most esteemed and most knowing of his Physicians, promised, that within Three Days Time he would prepare a Medicine for him which should restore him more expeditiously than could be imagined. Immediately after this En∣gagement, <HI>Alexander</HI> receives a Letter from the most considerable of his Captains, with Intelli∣gence, That <HI>Darius</HI> had bribed <HI>Philippus</HI> to poi∣son him. Every Circumstance imaginable favou∣red this Suspicion; but this Monarch, who did nothing but in an extraordinary Manner, conceal∣ed the Letter; and while the Medicine was pre∣paring, spent all his Thoughts upon his Behaviour
<PB N="89" REF="99"/>
in this important Incident. From his long Soli∣loquy he came to this Resolution: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Alexander</HI> must not lie here alive to be oppressed by his Enemy. I will not believe my Physician guilty; or, I will perish rather by his Guilt, than my own Diffidence.'</Q></P>
<P>At the appointed Hour, <HI>Philippus</HI> enters with the Potion. One cannot but form to one's self on Occasion the Encounter of their Eyes, the Resolu∣tion in those of the Patient, and the Benevolence in the Countenance of the Physician. The Hero raised himself in his Bed, and holding the Letter in one Hand, and the Potion in the other, drank the Medicine. It will exercise my Friend's Pencil and Brain to place this Action in its proper Beauty. A Prince observing the Features of a suspected Traytor after having drank the Poison he offer'd him, is a Circumstance so full of Passion, that it will require the highest Strength of his Imagina∣tion to conceive it, much more to express it. But as Painting is Eloquence and Poetry in Mecha∣nism, I shall raise his Idea's, by reading with him the finest Draughts of the Passions concerned in this Circumstance from the most excellent Poets and Orators. The Confidence which <HI>Alexander</HI> assumes from the Air of <HI>Philippus</HI>'s Face as he is reading his Accusation, and the generous Disdain which is to rise in the Features of a falsly accused Man, are principally to be regarded. In this Par∣ticular he must heighten his Thoughts, by reflect∣ing, that he is not drawing only an innocent Man traduced, but a Man zealously affected to his Per∣son and Safety, full of Resentment for being thought false. How shall we contrive to express the highest Admiration mingled with Disdain? How shall we in Strokes of a Pencil say, what <HI>Philippus</HI> did to his Prince on this Occasion? <Q REND="inline">"Sir, my Life never depended on yours more than it does now. Without knowing this Secret, I prepared the Potion, which you have taken as
<PB N="90" REF="100"/>
what concerned <HI>Philippus</HI> no less than <HI>Alexander;</HI> and there is nothing new in this Adventure, but that it makes me still more admire the Generosity and Confidence of my Master."</Q> <HI>Alexander</HI> took him by the Hand, and said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Philippus,</HI> I am con∣fident you had rather I had any other Way to have manifested the Faith I have in you, than a Case which so nearly concerns me: And in Gra∣titude I now assure you, I am anxious for the Effect of your Medicine, more for your Sake than my own.'</Q></P>
<P>My Painter is employed by a Man of Sense and Wealth to furnish him a Gallery, and I shall join with my Friend in the Designing Part. It is the great Use of Pictures to raise in our Minds either agreeable Idea's of our absent Friends, or high Images of eminent Personages. But the latter De∣sign is, methinks, carried on in a very improper Way: For to fill a Room full of Battle-Pieces, pompous Histories of Sieges, and a tall Hero a∣lone in a Crowd of insignificant Figures about him, is of no Consequence to private Men. But to place before our Eyes great and illustrious Men in those Parts and Circumstances of Life wherein their Behaviour may have an Effect upon our Minds, as being such as we partake with them merely as they were Men: Such as these, I say, may be just and useful Ornaments of an elegant Apartment. In this Collection therefore that we are making, we will not have the Battles, but the Sentiments of <HI>Alexander.</HI> The Affair we were just now talking of, has Circumstances of the highest Nature, and yet their Grandeur has little to do with his Fortune. If by observing such a Piece as that of his taking a Bowl of Poison with so much Magnanimity, a Man, the next Time he has a Fit of the Spleen, is less froward to his Friend or his Servants; thus far is some Improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="101"/>
I have frequently thought, that if we had many Draughts which were Historical of certain Passions, and had the true Figure of the great Men we see transported by them, it would be of the most solid Advantage imaginable. To consider this mighty Man on one Occasion administer to the Wants of a poor Soldier, benummed with Cold, with the greatest Humanity; at another, barbarously stab∣bing a faithful Officer: At one Time, so gene∣rously chast and virtuous as to give his Captive <HI>Statira</HI> her Liberty; at another, burning a Town at the Instigation of <HI>Thais.</HI> This Sort of Changes in the same Person are what would be more bene∣ficial Lessons of Morality, than the several Revo∣lutions in a great Man's Fortune. There are but One or Two in an Age to whom the pompous In∣cidents of his Life can be exemplary; but I or any Man may be as sick, as good-natur'd, as compassio∣nate, and as angry, as <HI>Alexander the great.</HI> My Purpose in all this Chat is, that so excellent a Fur∣niture may not for the future have so Romantick a Turn, but allude to Incidents which come with∣in the Fortunes of the ordinary Race of Men. I do not know but 'tis by the Force of this senseless Custom that People are drawn in Postures they would not for half they are worth be surprised in. The unparallell'd Firceness of some Rural 'Squires drawn in Red, or in Armour, who never dreamed to destroy any Thing above a Fox, is a common and ordinary Offence of this Kind. But I shall give an Account of our whole Gallery on another Occasion.</P>

<P>I Did my self the Honour this Day to make a Visit to a Lady of Quality, who is one of those who are ever railing at the Vices of the Age, but mean only one Vice, because it is the only Vice they are not guilty of. She went so far as to fall foul on a young Woman who has had Imputa∣tions; but whether they were just or not, no one knows but her self. However that is, she is in her present Behaviour modest, humble, pious, and discreet. I thought it became me to bring this cen∣sorious Lady to Reason, and let her see she was a much more vitious Woman than the Person she spoke of.</P>
<P>Madam, said I, you are very severe to this poor young Woman, for a Trespass which I believe Heaven has forgiven her, and for which you see she is for ever out of Countenance. Nay, Mr. <HI>Bick∣erstaff,</HI> she interrupted, If you at this Time of Day contradict People of Virtue, and stand up for ill Women—No, no, Madam, said I, not so fast, she is reclaimed, and I fear you never will be. Nay, nay, Madam, do not be in a Passion, but let me tell you what you are. You are indeed as good as your Neighbours, but that is being very bad. You are a Woman at the Head of a Family, and lead a perfect Town Lady's Life. You go on your own Way, and consult nothing but your Glass. What Imperfections indeed you see there, you immediately mend as fast as you can. You may do the same by the Faults I tell you of, for they are much more in your Power to correct.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="103"/>
You are to know then, that you Visiting Ladies, that carry your Virtue from House to House with so much Prattle in each other's Applause, and tri∣umph over other People's Faults, I grant you have but the Speculation of Vice in your own Conver∣sations, but, promote the Practice of it in all others you have to do with.</P>
<P>As for you, Madam, your Time passes away in Dressing, Eating, Sleeping, and Praying. When you rise in Morning, I grant you an Hour spent very well; but you come out to dress in so fro∣ward a Humour, that the poor Girl who attends you, curses her very Being in that she is your Ser∣vant, for the peevish Things you say to her. When this poor Creature is put into a Way, that Good or Evil are regarded but as they relieve her from the Hours she has and must pass with you. The next you have to do with, is your Coachman and Footmen. They convey your Ladyship to Church. While you are praying there, they are cursing, swearing, and drinking in an Ale-house. During the Time also which your Ladyship sets apart for Heaven, you are to know, that your Cook is sweating and fretting in Preparation for your Dinner. Soon after your Meal you make Visits, and the whole World that belongs to you speaks all the Ill of you which you are repeating of o∣thers. You see, Madam, whatever Way you go, all about you are in a very broad one. The Mora∣lity of these People it is your proper Business to enquire into; and till you reform them, you had best let your Equals alone; otherwise, if I allow you you are not vitious, you must allow me you are not virtuous.</P>
<P>I took my Leave, and received at my coming Home the following Letter:</P>

<P>I Have lived a pure and undefiled Virgin these Twenty seven Years; and I assure you, 'tis with great Grief and Sorrow of Heart I tell you, that I become weary and impatient of the Deri∣sion of the Gigglers of our Sex who call me old Maid, and tell me I shall lead Apes. If you are truly a Patron of the Distressed, and an Adept in Astrology, you will advise whether I shall or ought to be prevailed upon by the Impertinen∣cies of my own Sex, to give Way to the Impor∣tunities of yours. I assure you, I am surrounded with both, tho' at present a Forlorn.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I must defer my Answer to this Lady out of a Point of Chronology. She says, she has been Twenty Seven Years a Maid; but I fear, according to a common Error, she dates her Virginity from her Birth, which is a very erroneous Method; for a Woman of Twenty is no more to be thought chast so many Years, than a Man of that Age can be said to have been so long Valiant. We must not allow People the Favour of a Virtue till they have been under the Temptation to the contrary. A Woman is not a Maid till her Birth-Day, as we call it, of her Fifteenth Year. My Plaintiff is there∣fore desired to inform me, whether she is at pre∣sent in her Twenty eighth or Forty third Year, and she shall be dispatched accordingly.</P>

<P>A Merchant came hither this Morning, and read a Letter from a Correspondent of his at <HI>Milan.</HI> It was dated of the 7th Instant. N. S. The following is an Abstract of it. On the 25th of the last Month Five Thousand Men were on their March in the <HI>Lampourdan,</HI> under the Command of General <HI>We¦sell,</HI> having received Orders from his Catholick Majesty to join him in his Camp with all possible
<PB N="95" REF="105"/>
Expedition. The Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> soon had Intelli∣gence of their Motion, and took a Resolution to decamp, in order to intercept them, within a Day's March of our Army. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was ap∣prehensive the Enemy might make such a Move∣ment, and commanded General <HI>Stanhope</HI> with a Body of Horse, consisting of Fourteen Squadrons, to observe their Course, and prevent their Passage over the Rivers <HI>Segra</HI> and <HI>Noguera</HI> between <HI>Larida</HI> and <HI>Balaguer.</HI> It happened to be the first Day that Officer had appeared Abroad after a dangerous and violent Fever; but he received the King's Com∣mands on this Occasion with a Joy which sur∣mounted his present Weakness, and on the 27th of last Month came up with the Enemy on the Plains of <HI>Balaguer.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s Rear-Guard consisting of Twenty six Squadrons, that General sent Intelligence of their Posture to the King, and desired his Majesty's Orders to attack them. During the Time which he waited for his Instructions, he made his Disposition for the Charge, which was to divide themselves into Three Bodies; One to be commanded by himself in the Center, a Body on the Right by Count <HI>Mau∣rice</HI> of <HI>Nassau,</HI> and the Third on the Left by the Earl of <HI>Rochford.</HI> Upon the Receipt of his Ma∣jesty's Direction to attack the Enemy, the General himself charged with the utmost Vigour and Re∣solution, while the Earl of <HI>Rochford</HI> and Count <HI>Maurice</HI> extended themselves on his Right and Left, to prevent the Advantage the Enemy might make of the Superiority of their Numbers. What appears to have misled the Enemy's General in this Affair was, that it was not supposed practicable that the Confederates would attack him till they had received a Reinforcement. For this Reason he pursued his March without facing about, till we were actually coming on to Engagement. Gene∣ral <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s Disposition made it impracticable to do it at that Time, Count <HI>Maurice</HI> and the Earl
<PB N="96" REF="106"/>
of <HI>Rochford</HI> attacking them in the Instant in which they were forming themselves. The Charge was made with the greatest Gallantry, and the Enemy very soon put into so great Disorder, that their whole Cavalry were commanded to support their Rear-Guard. Upon the Advance of this Rein∣forcement, all the Horse of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> were come up to sustain General <HI>Stanhope,</HI> inso∣much that the Battle improved to a general En∣gagement of the Cavalry of both Armies. After a warm Dispute for some Time, it ended in the utter Defeat of all the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s Horse. Upon the Dispatch of these Advices, that Prince was retiring towards <HI>Lerida.</HI> We have no Ac∣count of any considerable Loss on our Side, except that both those Heroick Youths, the Earl of <HI>Roch∣ford</HI> and Count <HI>Nassau,</HI> fell in this Action. They were, you know, both Sons of Persons who had a great Place in the Confidence of your late King <HI>William;</HI> and I doubt not but their Deaths will endear their Families, which were ennobled by him, in your Nation. General <HI>Stanhope</HI> has been reported by the Enemy dead of his Wounds; but he received only a slight Contusion on the Shoul∣der.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> We acknowledge you here a mighty brave People; but you are said to love quarrelling so well, that you cannot be quiet at Home. The Favourers of the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> among us affirm, That this <HI>Stanhope,</HI> who could as it were get out of his sick Bed to fight against their King of <HI>Spain,</HI> must be of the Antimonarchical Party.</P>

<P>IF there were no other Consequence of it, but barely that Humane Creatures on this Day as∣semble themselves before their Creator, with∣out Regard to their usual Employments, their Minds at Leisure from the Cares of this Life, and their Bodies adorned with the best Attire they can bestow on them; I say, were this meer outward Celebration of a Sabbath all that is ex∣pected from Men, even that were a laudable Di∣stinction, and a Purpose worthy the Humane Na∣ture. But when there is added to it the sublime Pleasure of Devotion, our Being is exalted above it self; and he who spends a Seventh Day in the Contemplation of the next Life, will not easily fall into the Corruptions of this in the other Six. They who never admit Thoughts of this Kind into their Imagination, lose higher and sweeter Satisfactions than can be raised by any other En∣tertainment. The most illiterate Man who is touched with Devotion, and uses frequent Exer∣cises of it, contracts a certain Greatness of Mind, mingled with a noble Simplicity, that raises him above those of the same Condition; and there is an indelible Mark of Goodness in those who sin∣cerely possess it. It is hardly possible it should be otherwise; for the Fervours of a pious Mind will naturally contract such an Earnestness and Attention towards a better Being, as will make
<PB N="98" REF="108"/>
the ordinary Passages of Life go off with a be∣coming Indifference. By this, a Man in the lowest Condition will not appear mean, or in the most splendid Fortune, insolent.</P>
<P>As to all the Intricacies and Vicissitudes under which Men are ordinarily intangled with the ut∣most Sorrow and Passion, one who is devoted to Heaven when he falls into such Difficulties is led by a Clue through a Labyrinth. As to this World, he does not pretend to Skill in the Mazes of it, but fixes his Thoughts upon one Certainty, that he shall soon be out of it. And we may ask very boldly, What can be a more sure Consola∣tion than to have an Hope in Death? When Men are arrived at thinking of their very Dissolution with Pleasure, how few Things are there that can be terrible to them? Certainly nothing can be dreadful to such Spirits, but what would make Death terrible to them, Falshood towards Man, or Impiety towards Heaven. To such as these, as there are certainly many such, the Gratifications of innocent Pleasures are doubled, even with Re∣flections upon their Imperfection. The Disap∣pointments which naturally attend the great Pro∣mises we make our selves in expected Enjoy∣ments, strike no Damp upon such Men, but only quicken their Hopes of soon knowing Joys, which are too pure to admit of Allay or Sa∣tiety.</P>
<P>It is thought among the politer Part of Man∣kind an Imperfection to want a Relish of any of those Things which refine our Lives. This is the Foundation of the Acceptance which Eloquence, Musick, and Poetry, make in the World; and I know not why Devotion, considered meerly as an Exaltation of our Happiness, should not at leas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be so far regarded as to be considered. It is pos¦sible the very Enquiry would lead Men into suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thoughts and Gratifications as they did not ex¦pect to meet with in this Place. Many a goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="99" REF="109"/>
Acquaintance has been lost from a general Pre∣possession in his Disfavour, and a severe Aspect has often hid under it a very agreeable Compa∣nion.</P>
<P>There are no distinguishing Qualities among Men to which there are not false Pretenders; but tho' none is more pretended to than that of De∣votion, there are, perhaps, fewer successful Im∣postors in this Kind than any other. There is something so natively great and good in a Person that is truly devout, that an aukward Man may as well pretend to be genteel, as an Hypocrite to be pious. The Constraint in Words and Actions are equally visible in both Cases, and any Thing set up in their Room does but remove the En∣deavourers the further off their Pretensions. But however the Sense of true Piety is abated, there is no other Motive of Action that can carry us through all the Vicissitudes of Life with Alacrity and Resolution. But Piety, like Philosophy, when it is superficial, does but make Men ap∣pear the worse for it; and a Principle that is but half received, does but distract, instead of gui∣ding our Behaviour. When I reflect upon the unequal Conduct of <HI>Lotius,</HI> I see many Things that run directly counter to his Interest; there∣fore I cannot attribute his Labours for the publick Good to Ambition. When I consider his Disre∣gard to his Fortune, I cannot esteem him cove∣tous. How then can I reconcile his Neglect of himself, and his Zeal for others? I have long suspected him to be <HI>a little Pious:</HI> But no Man ever hid his Vice with greater Caution than he does his Virtue. It was the Praise of a great <HI>Ro∣man,</HI> That he had rather be, than appear good. But such is the Weakness of <HI>Lotius,</HI> that I dare say, he had rather be esteemed irreligious, than devout. By I know not what Impatience of Rail∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery he is wonderfully fearful of being thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo great a Believer. A Hundred little Devices
<PB N="100" REF="110"/>
are made use of to hide a Time of private Devo∣tion; and he will allow you any Suspicion of his being ill employed, so you do not tax him with being well. But alas! How mean is such a Be∣haviour? To boast of Virtue is a most ridiculous Way of disappointing the Merit of it, but not so pitiful as that of being ashamed of it. How un∣happy is the Wretch who makes the most abso∣lute and independent Motive of Action the Cause of Perplexity and Inconstancy? How much ano∣ther Figure does <HI>Caelicola</HI> make with all who know him? His great and superior Mind, fre∣quently exalted by the Raptures of Heavenly Me∣ditation, is to all his Friends of the same Use as if an Angel were to appear at the Decision of their Disputes. They very well understand he is as much disinterested and unbiass'd as such a Be∣ing. He considers all Applications made to him, as those Addresses will effect his own Applica∣tion to Heaven. All his Determinations are de∣liver'd with a beautiful Humility; and he pro∣nounces his Decisions with the Air of one who is more frequently a Supplicant than a Judge.</P>
<P>Thus humble, and thus great, is the Man who is moved by Piety, and exalted by Devotion. But behold this recommended by the masterly Hand of a great Divine I have heretofore made bold with.</P>
<Q>It is such a Pleasure as can never cloy or overwork the Mind; a Delight that grows and improves under Thought and Reflection; and while it exercises, does also endear it self to the Mind. All Pleasure that affect the Body must needs weary, because they transport; and all Transportation is a Violence; and no Violence can be lasting, but determines upon the Falling of the Spirits, which are not able to keep up that Height of Motion that the Plea¦sure of the Senses raises them to. And there¦fore how inevitably does an immoderate Laugh¦ter <PB N="101" REF="111"/>
end in a Sigh, which is only Nature's reco∣vering it self after a Force done to it: But the religious Pleasure of a well-disposed Mind moves gently, and therefore constantly. It does not effect by Rapture and Extasie, but is like the Pleasure of Health, greater and stronger than those that call up the Senses with grosser and more affecting Impressions. No Man's Body is as strong as his Appetites; but Heaven has cor∣rected the Boundlesness of his voluptuous De∣sires by stinting his Strengths, and contracting his Capacities.—The Pleasure of the reli∣gious Man is an easy and a portable Pleasure, such an one as he carries about in his Bosom, without alarming either the Eye or Envy of the World. A Man putting all his Pleasure into this one, is like a Traveller putting all his Goods into one Jewel; the Value is the same, and the Convenience greater.</Q>

<P>REading over a Volume of Yours, I find the Words <HI>Simplex Munditiis</HI> mentioned as a De∣scription of a very well dressed Woman. I beg of you, for the Sake of the Sex, to explain these Terms. I cannot comprehend what my Brother means,

</LETTER>
<P>I think the Lady's Brother has given us a very good Idea of that elegant Expression, it being the greatest Beauty of Speech to be close and intelli∣gible. To this End nothing is to be more care∣fully consulted than Plainness. In a Lady's At∣tire this is the single Excellence; for to be what some call fine, is the same Vice in that Case, as to be florid is in Writing or Speaking. I have studied and writ on this important Subject till I almost despair of making a Reformation in the Females of this Island, where we have more Beauty than in any Spot in the Universe, if we did not disguise it by false Garniture, and detract from it by impertinent Improvements. I have by me a Treatise concerning Pinners, which I have some Hopes will contribute to the Amend∣ment of the present Head-dresses, to which I have solid and unanswerable Objections. But most of the Errors in that and other Particulars of adorning the Head, are crept into the World from the Ignorance of modern Tirewomen; for it is come to that Pass, that an aukward Crea∣ture in the first Year of her Apprenticeship, that can hardly stick a Pin, shall take upon her to dress a Woman of the First Quality. However it is certain, that there requires in a good Tire∣woman a perfect Skill in Opticks; for all the Force of Ornament is to contribute to the Inten∣tion of the Eyes. Thus she who has a Mind to look killing, must arm her Face accordingly, and not leave her Eyes and Cheeks undressed. Ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is <HI>Araminta</HI> so sensible of this, that she neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="103" REF="113"/>
will see even her own Husband without a Hood on. Can any one living bear to see Miss <HI>Gruel,</HI> lean as she is, with her Hair tied back after the modern Way? But such is the Folly of our La∣dies, that because one who is a Beauty, out of Ostentation of her being such, takes Care to wear something that she knows cannot be of any Consequence to her Complexion; I say, our Wo∣men run on so heedlesly in the Fashion, that tho' it is the Interest of some to hide as much of their Faces as possible, yet because a leading Toast ap∣peared with a backward Head-dress, the rest shall follow the Mode, without observing that the Author of the Fashion assumed it because it could become no one but her self.</P>
<P><HI>Flavia</HI> is ever well dressed, and always the gentilest Woman you meet: But the Make of her Mind very much contributes to the Ornament of her Body. She has the greatest Simplicity of Manners of any of her Sex. This makes every Thing look native about her, and her Cloaths are so exactly fitted, that they appear as it were Part of her Person. Every one that sees her, knows her to be of Quality; but her Distinction is owing to her Manner, and not to her Habit. Her Beauty is full of Attraction, but not of Al∣lurement. There is such a Composure in her Looks, and Propriety in her Dress, that you would think it impossible she should change the Garb you one Day see her in for any Thing so becoming, till you next Day see her in another. There is no other Mystery in this, but that how∣ever she is apparelled, she is her self the same: For there is so immediate a Relation between our Thoughts and Gestures, that a Woman must think well to look well.</P>
<P>But this weighty Subject I must put off for some other Matters in which my Correspondents are urgent for Answers, which I shall do where I
<PB N="104" REF="114"/>
can, and appeal to the Judgment of others where I cannot.</P>

<P>THere has of late crept in among the downright <HI>English,</HI> a mighty Spirit of Dissimulation. But before we discourse of this Vice, it will be ne∣cessary to observe, that the Learned make a Dif∣ference between Simulation and Dissimulation. Si∣mulation is a Pretence of what is not, and Dis∣simulation a Concealment of what is. The lat∣ter
<PB N="106" REF="116"/>
is our present Affair. When you look round you in publick Places in this Island, you see the Generality of Mankind carry in their Counte∣nance an Air of Challenge or Defiance: And there is no such Man to be found among us who naturally strives to do greater Honours and Civi∣lities than he receives. This innate Sullenness or Stubborness of Complexion is hardly to be con∣quered by any of our Islanders. For which Rea∣son, however they may pretend to choose one another, they make but very aukward Rogues; and their Dislike to each other is seldom so well dissembled, but it is suspected. When once it is so, it had as good be professed. A Man who dis∣sembles well, must have none of what we call Stomach, otherwise he will be cold in his Pro∣fessions of Good-Will where he hates; an Imper∣fection of the last ill Consequence in Business. This Fierceness in our Natures is apparent from the Conduct of our young Fellows, who are not got into the Schemes and Arts of Life which the Children of this World walk by. One would think that of Course, when a Man of any Con∣sequence for his Figure, his Mien, or his Gravity, passes by a Youth, he should certainly have the first Advances of Salutation; but he is, you may observe, treated in a quite different Manner, it being the very Characteristick of an <HI>English</HI> Temper to defy. As I am an <HI>Englishman,</HI> I find it a very hard Matter to bring my self to pull off the Hat first; but it is the only Way to be upon any good Terms with those we meet with: There∣fore the first Advance is of high Moment. Men judge of others by themselves; and he that will command with us, must condescend. It moves ones Spleen very agreeably to see Fellows pre∣tend to be Dissemblers without this Lesson. They are so reservedly complaisant till they have learn¦ed to resign their natural Passions, that all the Steps they make towards gaining those whom
<PB N="107" REF="117"/>
they would be well with, are but so many Marks of what they really are, and not of what they would appear.</P>
<P>The rough <HI>Britains,</HI> when they pretend to be artful towards one another, are ridiculous enough; but when they set up for Vices they have not, and dissemble their Good with an Affectation of Ill, they are insupportable. I know Two Men in this Town who make as good Figures as any in it, that manage their Credit so well as to be thought Atheists, and yet say their Prayers Mor∣ning and Evening. <HI>Tom.

<P>I Have lately read your Paper, wherein you represent a Conversation between a young Lady, your Three Nephews, and your self; and am not a little offended at the Figure you give your young Merchant in the Presence of a Beau∣ty. The Topick of Love is a Subject on which a Man is more beholden to Nature for his Elo∣quence, than to the Instruction of the Schools, or my Lady's Woman. From the Two latter, your Scholar and Page must have reaped all their Advantage above him—I know by this Time you have pronounced me a Trader. I ac∣knowledge it, but cannot bear the Exclusion from any Pretence of speaking agreeably to a Fine Woman, or from any Degree of Genero∣sity that Way. You have among us Citizens
<PB N="108" REF="118"/>
many Well-wishers, but it is for the Justice of your Representations, which we, perhaps, are better Judges of than you (by the Account you give of your Nephew) seem to allow.</P>
<P>To give you an Opportunity of making us some Reparation, I desire you would tell your own Way the following Instance of Heroick Love in the City. You are to remember, that somewhere in your Writings, for enlarging the Territories of Virtue and Honour, you have multiplied the Opportunities of attaining to He∣roick Virtue, and have hinted, that in whatever State of Life a Man is, if he does Things above what is ordinarily performed by Men of his Rank, he is in those Instances an Hero.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Trueman,</HI> a young Gentleman of Eighteen Years of Age, fell passionately in Love with the beauteous <HI>Almira,</HI> Daughter to his Master. Her Regard for him was no less tender. <HI>True∣man</HI> was better acquainted with his Master's Affairs than his Daughter, and secretly lament∣ed, that each Day brought him by many Mis∣carriages nearer Bankrupcy than the former. This unhappy Posture of their Affairs the Youth suspected was owing to the ill Manage∣ment of a Factor, in whom his Master had an entire Confidence. <HI>Trueman</HI> took a proper Oc∣casion, when his Master was ruminating on his decaying Fortune, to address him for Leave to spend the Remainder of his Time with his Fo∣reign Correspondent. During Three Years Stay in that Employment, he became acquaint∣ed with all that concerned his Master; and by his great Address in the Management of that Knowledge, saved him Ten thousand Pounds. Soon after this Accident, <HI>Trueman</HI>'s Unkle left him a considerable Estate. Upon receiving that Advice, he returned to <HI>England,</HI> and deman∣ded <HI>Almira</HI> of her Father. The Father over joy'd at the Match, offer'd him the 10000 <HI>l.</HI> he
<PB N="109" REF="119"/>
had saved him, with the further Proposal of resigning to him all his Business, <HI>Trueman</HI> re∣fused both, and retired into the Country with his Bride, contented with his own Fortune, tho' perfectly skill'd in all the Methods of improving it.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, That <HI>Trueman</HI> refused Twen∣ty Thousand Pounds with another young Lady; so that reckoning both his Self-Denials, he is to have in your Court the Merit of having gi∣ven 30000 <HI>l.</HI> for the Woman he loved. This Gentleman I claim your Justice to; and hope you will be convinced, that some of us have larger Views than only Cash Debtor, <HI>per contra</HI> Creditor.</P>

<P>IN every Party there are Two Sorts of Men, the <HI>Rigid</HI> and the <HI>Supple.</HI> The <HI>Rigid</HI> are an intractable Race of Mortals, who act upon Prin∣ciple, and will not, forsooth, fall into any Mea∣sures that are not consistent with their received
<PB N="110" REF="120"/>
Notions of Honour. These are Persons of a stub∣born, unpliant Morality, that sullenly adhere to their Friends when they are disgraced, and to their Principles, tho' they are exploded. I shall therefore give up this stiff-necked Generation to their own Obstinacy, and turn my Thoughts to the Advantage of the <HI>Supple,</HI> who pay their Ho∣mage to Places, and not Persons; and without enslaving themselves to any particular Scheme of Opinions, are as ready to change their Conduct in Point of Sentiment, as of Fashion. The well∣disciplined Part of a Court are generally so per∣fect at their Exercise, that you may see a whole Assembly, from Front to Rear, face about at once to a new Man of Power, tho' at the same Time they turn their Backs upon him that brought them thither. The great Hardship these com∣plaisant Members of Society are under, seems to be the Want of Warning upon any approaching Change or Revolution; so that they are obliged in a Hurry to tack about with every Wind, and stop short in the Midst of a full Career, to the great Surprize and Derision of their Beholders.</P>
<P>When a Man foresees a decaying Ministry, he has Leisure to grow a Malecontent, reflect upon the present Conduct, and by gradual Murmurs fall off from his Friends into a new Party, by just Steps and Measures. For Want of such No∣tices, I have formerly known a very well-bred Person refuse to return a Bow of a Man whom he thought in Disgrace, that was next Day made Se∣cretary of State; and another, who after a long Neglect of a Minister, came to his Levee, and made Professions of Zeal for his Service the very Day before he was turned out.</P>
<P>This produces also unavoidable Confusions and Mistakes in the Descriptions of great Mens Parts and Merits. That ancient Lyrick, Mr. <HI>D'Urfey,</HI> some Years ago writ a Dedication to a certain Lord, in which he celebrated him for the greatest
<PB N="111" REF="121"/>
Poet and Critick of that Age, upon a Misinfor∣mation in <HI>Dyer</HI>'s Letter, that his noble Patron was made Lord Chamberlain. In short, innume∣rable Votes Speeches, and Sermons, have been thrown away, and turned to no Account, meerly for Want of due and timely Intelligence. Nay it has been known, that a Panegyrick has been half printed off, when the Poet, upon the Removal of the Minister, has been forced to alter it into a Satyr.</P>
<P>For the Conduct therefore of such useful Per∣sons as are ready to do their Country Service up∣on all Occasions, I have an Engine in my Study, which is a Sort of a Political Barometer, or, to speak more intelligibly, a State <HI>Weather-Glass,</HI> that, by the rising and falling of a certain Magi∣cal Liquor, presages all Changes and Revolu∣tions in Government, as the common Glass does those of the Weather. This Weather-Glass is said to have been invented by <HI>Cardan,</HI> and given by him as a Present to his great Countryman and Contemporary <HI>Machiavel,</HI> which (by the Way) may serve to rectify a received Error in Chronology, that places one of these some Years after the other. How or when it came into my Hands, I shall desire to be excused, if I keep to my self; but so it is, that I have walked by it for the better Part of a Century, to my Safety at least, if not to my Advantage; and have among my Papers, a Register of all the Changes that have happened in it from the Middle of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign.</P>
<P>In the Time of that Princess, it stood long at <HI>settled Fair.</HI> At the latter End of King <HI>James</HI> the First, it fell to <HI>Cloudy.</HI> It held several Years after at <HI>Stormy;</HI> insomuch that at last despairing of seeing any <HI>Clear</HI> Weather at Home, I follow'd the Royal Exile, and some Time after finding my Glass rise, returned to my native Country with the rest of the Loyalists. I was then in
<PB N="112" REF="122"/>
Hopes to pass the Remainder of my Days in <HI>set∣tled Fair:</HI> But alas! during the greatest Part of that Reign, the <HI>English</HI> Nation lay in a <HI>dead Calm,</HI> which, as it is usual, was followed by high Winds and Tempests till of late Years: In which, with unspeakable Joy and Satisfaction, I have seen our Political Weather returned to <HI>settled Fair.</HI> I must only observe, that for all this last Summer my Glass has pointed at Changeable. Upon the whole, I often apply to Fortune <HI>Aenaeas</HI>'s Speech to the Sybil:</P>
<Q><L>— Non ulla Laborum,</L>
<L>O Virgo, nova mi Facies inopinave surgit</L>
<L>Omnia praecepi, at{que} Animo mecum ante peregi.</L></Q>
<P>The Advantages which have accured to those whom I have advised in their Affairs, by Vertue of this Sort of Praescience, have been very consi∣derable. A Nephew of mine, who has never put his Money into the Stocks, or taken it out, without my Advice, has in a few Years raised Five hundred Pounds to almost so many Thou∣sands. As for my self, who look upon Riches to consist rather in Content than Possessions, and measure the Greatness of the Mind rather by its Tranquility than its Ambition. I have seldom used my Glass to make my Way in the World, but often to retire from it. This is a By-Path to Happiness, which was first discovered to me by a most pleasing Apothegm of <HI>Pythagoras: When the Winds,</HI> says he, <HI>rise, worship the Eccho.</HI> That great Philosopher (whether to make his Doctrines the more venerable, or to guild his Precepts with the Beauty of Imagination, or to awaken the Curiosity of his Disciples; for I will not sup∣pose what is usually said, that he did it to conceal his Wisdom from the Vulgar) has couched seve∣ral admirable Precepts in remote Allusions and mysterious Sentences. By the Winds in this Apo∣thegm, are meant State-Hurricanes and popular
<PB N="113" REF="123"/>
Tumults. When these arise, says he, worship the Eccho; that is, withdraw your self from the Multitude into Deserts, Woods, Solitudes, or the like Retirements, which are the usual Habitations of the Eccho.</P>

<P><HI>LYsander</HI> has writ to me out of the Country, and tells me, after many other Circum∣stances, that he had passed a great deal of Time with much Pleasure and Tranquility, till his Happiness was interrupted by an indiscreet Flat∣terer, who came down into those Parts to visit a Relation. With the Circumstances in which he represents the Matter, he had no small Provoca∣tion to be offended, for he attacked him in so wrong a Season, that he could not have any Re∣lish of Pleasure in it; tho', perhaps, at another Time, it might have passed upon him without giving him much Uneasiness. <HI>Lysander</HI> had, af∣ter a long Satiety of the Town, been so happy as to get to a Solitude he extremely liked, and re∣covered a Pleasure he had long discontinued, that of Reading. He was got to the Bank of a Ri∣vulet, covered by a pleasing Shade, and fanned by a soft Breeze, which threw his Mind into that Sort of Composure and Attention, in which a Man, though with Indolence, enjoys the utmost Liveliness of his Spirits, and the greatest Strength of his Mind at the same Time. In this State, <HI>Lysander</HI> represents that he was reading <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Georgicks;</HI> when on a sudden the Gentleman abovementioned surprised him, and, without any
<PB N="114" REF="124"/>
Manner of Preparation, falls upon him at once, <Q REND="inline">'What! I have found you out at last, after searching all over the Wood. We wanted you at Cards after Dinner, but you are much better employed. I have heard indeed that you are an excellent Scholar: But at the same Time, is it not a little unkind to rob the Ladies, who like you so well, of the Pleasure of your Com∣pany? But that is indeed the Misfortune of you great Scholars, you are seldom so fit for the World, as those who never trouble themselves with Books. Well, I see you are taken up with your Learning there, and I'll leave you.'</Q> <HI>Ly∣sander</HI> says, he made him no Answer, but took a Resolution to complain to me.</P>
<P>It is a substantial Affliction, when Men govern themselves by the Rules of good Breeding, that by the very Force of them they are subjected to the Insolence of those who either never will, or never can, understand them. The superficial Part of Mankind form to themselves little Mea∣sures of Behaviour from the Outside of Things. By the Force of these narrow Conceptions, they act amongst themselves with Applause, and do not apprehend they are contemptible to those of higher Understanding, who are restrained by De∣cencies above their Knowledge from showing a Dislike. Hence it is, that because Complaisance is a good Quality in Conversation, one Imperti∣nent takes upon him on all Occasions to com∣mend; and because Mirth is agreeable, another thinks fit eternally to jest. I have of late re∣ceived many Packets of Letters complaining of these spreading Evils. A Lady who is lately ar∣rived at the <HI>Bath</HI> acquaints me, there was in the Stage-Coach wherein she went down a common Flatterer, and a common Jester. These Gentle∣men were (she tells me) Rivals in her Favour and adds, If there ever happened a Case wherein of Two Persons One was not liked more than
<PB N="115" REF="125"/>
another, it was in that Journey. They differed only in Proportion to the Degree of Dislike be∣tween the Nauseous and the Insipid. Both these Characters of Men are born out of a Barrenness of Imagination. They are never Fools by Na∣ture, but become such out of an impotent Ambi∣tion of being what she never intended them, Men of Wit and Conversation. I therefore think fit to declare, That according to the known Laws of this Land, a Man may be a very honest Gen∣tleman, and enjoy himself and his Friend, with∣out being a Wit; and I absolve all Men from ta∣king Pains to be such for the future. As the pre∣sent Case stands, is it not very unhappy that <HI>Ly∣sander</HI> must be attacked and applauded in a Wood, and <HI>Corinna</HI> jolted and commended in a Stage-Coach; and this for no manner of Reason, but because other People have a Mind to show their Parts? I grant indeed, if these People (as they have Understanding enough for it) would confine their Accomplishments to those of their own Degree of Talents, it were to be tolerated; but when they are so insolent as to interrupt the Meditations of the Wise, the Conversations of the Agreeable, and the whole Behaviour of the Modest, it becomes a Grievance naturally in my Jurisdiction. Among themselves, I cannot only overlook, but approve it. I was present the o∣ther Day at a Conversation, where a Man of this Height of Breeding and Sense told a young Wo∣man of the same Form, To be sure, Madam, eve∣ry Thing must please that comes from a Lady. She answer'd, I know, Sir, you are so much a Gentleman that you think so. Why, this is very well on both Sides; and it is impossible that such a Gentleman and Lady should do other than think well of one another, These are but loose Hints of the Disturbances in humane Society, of which there is yet no Remedy: But I shall in a little Time publish Tables of Respect and Civility, by
<PB N="116" REF="126"/>
which Persons may be instructed in the proper Times and Seasons, as well as at what Degree of Intimacy a Man may be allowed to commend or rally his Companions; the promiscuous Licence of which is at present far from being among the small Errors in Conversation.</P>

<P>NAture is full of Wonders; every Atom is a standing Miracle, and endowed with such Qualities, as could not be impressed on it by a Power and Wisdom less than Infinite. For this Reason, I would not discourage any Searches that are made into the most minute and trivial Parts of the Creation. However, since the World a∣bounds in the noblest Fields of Speculation, it is, methinks, the Mark of a little Genius to be wholly conversant among Insects, Reptiles, Ani∣malcules, and those trifling Rarities that furnish out the Apartment of a Virtuoso.</P>
<P>There are some Men whose Heads are so odly turned this Way, that tho' they are utter Stran∣gers to the common Occurrences of Life, they are able to discover the Sex of a Cockle, or de∣scribe the Generation of a Mite, in all its Circum∣stances. They are so little versed in the World, that they scarce know a Horse from an Ox; but at the same Time will tell you, with a great deal of Gravity, That a Flea is a Rhinoceros, and a Snail an Hermaphrodite. I have known one of these whimsical Philosophers who has set a great∣er Value upon a Collection of Spiders than he would upon a Collection of Spiders than he would upon a Flock of Sheep, and has sold his Coat off his Back to purchase a Tarantula.</P>
<P>I would not have a Scholar wholly unacquaint∣ed with these Secrets and Curiosities of Nature; but certainly the Mind of Man, that is capable of
<PB N="119" REF="129"/>
so much higher Contemplations, should not be altogether fixed upon such mean and dispropor∣tioned Objects. Observations of this Kind are apt to alienate us too much from the Knowledge of the World, and to make us serious upon Tri∣fles, by which Means they expose Philosophy to the Ridicule of the Witty, and Contempt of the Ignorant. In short, Studies of this Nature should be the Diversions, Relaxations, and Amusements; not the Care, Business, and Concern of Life.</P>
<P>It is indeed wonderful to consider, that there should be a Sort of learned Men who are wholly employed in gathering together the Refuse of Na∣ture, if I may call it so, and hoarding up in their Chests and Cabinets such Creatures as others in∣dustriously avoid the Sight of. One does not know how to mention some of the most precious Parts of their Treasure, without a Kind of an Apology for it. I have been shown a Beetle va∣lued at Twenty Crowns, and a Toad at an Hun∣dred; But we must take this for a general Rule, That whatever appears trivial or obscene in the common Notions of the World, looks grave and philosophical in the Eye of a Virtuoso.</P>

<P>AS I was passing by a Neighbour's House this Morning, I overheard the Wife of the Fa∣mily speak Things to her Husband which gave me much Disturbance, and put me in Mind of a Character which I wonder I have so long omit∣ted, and that is, an outragious Species of the Fair Sex which is distinguished by the Term Scolds. The Generality of Women are by Na∣ture loquacious: Therefore meer Volubility of Speech is not to be imputed to them, but should be considered with Pleasure when it is used to ex∣press such Passions as tend to sweeten or adorn Conversation: But when, thro' Rage, Females are vehement in their Eloquence, nothing in the World has so ill an Effect upon the Features; for by the Force of it, I have seen the most Amiable become the most Deformed; and she that ap∣peared one of the Graces, immediately turned into one of the Furies. I humbly conceive, the great Cause of this Evil may proceed from a false Notion the Ladies have of what we call a Modest Woman. They have too narrow a Conception of this lovely Character, and believe they have not at all forfeited their Pretensions to it, provided they have no Imputations on their Chastity. But alas! the young Fellows know they pick out bet∣ter Women in the Side-Boxes, than many of those who pass upon the World and themselves for Mo∣dest.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="133"/>
Modesty never rages, never murmurs, never pouts: When it is ill treated, it pines, it be∣seeches, it languishes. The Neighbour I men∣tion is one of your common modest Women, that is to say, those as are ordinarily reckoned such. Her Husband knows every Pain in Life with her but Jealousy. Now because she is clear in this Particular, the Man can't say his Soul's his own, but she cries, No modest Woman is respected now a-days. What adds to the Comedy in this Case is, that it is very ordinary with this Sort of Women to talk in the Language of Distress: They will complain of the forlorn Wretchedness of their Condition, and then the poor helpless Creatures shall throw the next Thing they can lay their Hands on at the Person who offends them. Our Neighbour was only saying to his Wife, she went a little too fine, when she imme∣diately pulled his Periwig off, and stamping it under her Feet, wrung her Hands, and said, Ne∣ver modest Woman was so used: These Ladies of irresistible Modesty are those who make Vir∣tue unamiable; not that they can be said to be virtuous, but as they live without Scandal; and being under the common Denomination of being such, Men fear to meet their Faults in those who are as agreeable as they are innocent.</P>
<P>I take the Bully among Men, and the Scold a∣mong Women, to draw the Foundation of their Actions from the same Defect in the Mind A Bully thinks Honour consists wholly in being brave, and therefore has Regard to no one Rule of Life, if he preserves himself from the Accusa∣tion of Cowardize. The froward Woman knows Chastity to be the first Merit in a Woman; and therefore, since no one can call her one ugly Name, she calls all Mankind all the rest.</P>
<P>These Ladies, where their Companions are so imprudent as to take their Speeches for any other than Exercises of their own Lungs, and their
<PB N="124" REF="134"/>
Husbands Patience, gain by the Force of being resisted, and flame with open Fury, which is no Way to be opposed but by being neglected: Tho' at the same Time Humane Frailty makes it very hard to relish the Philosophy of contemning even frivolous Reproach. There is a very pretty In∣stance of this Infirmity in the Man of the best Sense that ever was, no less a Person than <HI>Adam</HI> himself. According to <HI>Milton</HI>'s Description of the First Couple, as soon as they had fallen, and the turbulent Passions of Anger, Hatred, and Jea∣lousy, first enter'd their Breasts, <HI>Adam</HI> grew moody, and talked to his Wife, as you may find it in the 359th Page, and 9th Book, of <HI>Paradise Lest,</HI> in the <HI>Octave</HI> Edition, which out of He∣roicks, and put into Domestick Stile, would run thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Madam, If my Advice had been of any Au∣thority with you when that strange Desire of Gadding possessed you this Morning, we had still been happy: But your cursed Vanity and Opi∣nion of your own Conduct, which is certainly very wavering when it seeks Occasions of being proved, has ruined both your self, and me who trusted you.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Eve</HI> had no Fan in her Hand to ruffle, or Tucker to pull down, but with a reproachful Air she an∣swered:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Sir, Do you impute that to my Desire of Gad∣ding, which might have happened to your self with all your Wisdom and Gravity?'</Q> The Ser∣pent spoke so excellently, and with so good a Grace, that—Besides, <Q REND="inline">'What Harm had I ever done him, that he should design me any? Was I to have been always at your Side, I might as well have continued there, and been but your Rib still: But if I was so weak a Creature as you thought me, Why did you not interpose your sage Authority more absolutely?
<PB N="125" REF="135"/>
You denied me going as faintly, as you say I resisted the Serpent. Had not you been too easie, neither you or I had now transgressed.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> replied, <Q REND="inline">'Why, <HI>Eve.</HI> hast thou the Im∣pudence to upbraid me as the Cause of thy Transgression for my Indulgence to thee? Thus it will ever be with him who trusts too much to Woman: At the same Time that she refuses to be governed, if she suffers by her Ostinacy, she will accuse the Man that shall leave her to her self.'</Q></P>
<Q><L>Thus they in mutual Accusation spent</L>
<L>The fruitless Hours, but neither self condemning:</L>
<L>And of their vain Contest appear'd no End.</L></Q>
<P>This to the Modern will appear but a very faint Piece of Conjugal Enmity; but you are to consider, that they were but just begun to be an∣gry, and they wanted new Words for expressing their new Passions. But her accusing him of let∣ting her go, and telling him how good a Speaker, and how fine a Gentleman the Devil was, we must reckon, allowing for the Improvements of Time, that she gave him the same Provocation as if she had called him Cuckold. The pas∣sionate and familiar Terms with which the same Case, repeated daily for so many Thousand Years, has furnished the present Generation, were not then in Use; but the Foundation of Debate has ever been the same, a Contention about their Merit and Wisdom. Our general Mother was a Beauty, and hearing there was another now in the World, could not forbear (as <HI>Adam</HI> tells her) showing her self, though to the Devil, by whom the same Vanity made her liable to be be∣trayed.</P>
<P>I cannot, with all the Help of Science and, Astrology, find any other Remedy for this Evil but what was the Medicine in this first Quarrel; which was, as appeared in the next Book, that
<PB N="126" REF="136"/>
they were convinced of their being both weak, but one weaker than the other.</P>
<P>If it were possible that the Beauteous could but rage a little before a Glass, and see their pret∣ty Countenances grow wild, it is not to be doubt∣ed but it would have a very good Effect; but that would require Temper: For Lady <HI>Firebrand,</HI> upon observing her Features swell when her Maid vexed her the other Day, stamped her Dressing-Glass under her Feet. In this Case, when one of this Temper is moved, she is like a Witch in an Operation, and makes all Things turn round with her. The very Fabrick is in a Vertigo when she begins to charm. In an In∣stant, whatever was the Occasion that moved her Blood, she has such intolerable Servants, <HI>Betty</HI> is so aukward, <HI>Tom</HI> can't carry a Message, and her Husband has so little Respect for her, that she, poor Woman, is weary of this Life, and was born to be unhappy.</P>

<P>I Chanced to rise very early one particular Morning this Summer, and took a Walk into the Country to divert my self among the Fields and Meadows, while the Green was new, and the Flowers in their Bloom. As at this Season of the Year every Lane is a beautiful Walk, and every Hedge full of Nosegays, I lost my self with a great deal of Pleasure among several Thickets and Bushes that were filled with a great Variety of Birds, and an agreeable Confusion of Notes, which formed the pleasantest Scene in the World to one who had pass'd a whole Winter in Noise and Smoak. The Freshness of the Dews that lay upon every Thing about me, with the cool Breath of the Morning, which inspired the Birds with so many delightful Instincts, created in me the same Kind of animal Pleasure, and made my Heart overflow with such secret Emotions of Joy and Satisfaction as are not to be described or ac∣counted for. On this Occasion I could not but reflect upon a beautiful Simile in <HI>Milton:</HI><Q><L>As one who long in populous City pent,</L>
<L>Where Houses thick, and Sewers, annoy the Air,</L>
<L>Forth issuing on a Summer's Morn, to breath</L>
<L>Among the pleasant Villages, and Farms</L>
<L>Adjoin'd, from each Thing met conceives Delight:</L>
<L>The Smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,</L>
<L>Or Dairy, each rural Sight, each rural Sound.</L></Q> <PB N="128" REF="138"/>
Those who are conversant in the Writings of po∣lite Authors, receive an additional Entertainment from the Country, as it revives in their Memories those charming Descriptions with which such Authors do frequently abound.</P>
<P>I was thinking of the foregoing beautiful Si∣mile in <HI>Milton,</HI> and applying it to my self, when I observed to the Windward of me a black Cloud falling to the Earth in long Trails of Rain, which made me betake my self for Shelter to a House which I saw at a little Distance from the Place where I was walking. As I sat in the Porch, I heard the Voices of Two or Three Persons, who seemed very earnest in Discourse. My Curiosity was raised when I heard the Names of <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> and <HI>Artaxerxes;</HI> and as their Talk seemed to run on ancient Heroes, I concluded there could not be any Secret in it; for which Reason I thought I might very fairly listen to what they said.</P>
<P>After several Parallels between great Men, which appeared to me altogether groundless and chimerical, I was surprized to hear one say, That he valued the <HI>Black Prince</HI> more than the Duke of <HI>Vendosme.</HI> How the Duke of <HI>Vendosme</HI> should become a Rival of the <HI>Black Prince</HI>'s, I could not conceive: And was more startled when I heard a Second affirm with great Vehemence, That if the Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> was not going off, he should like him better than either of them. He added, That tho' the Season was so changeable, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was in blooming Beau∣ty. I was wondering to my self from whence they had received this odd Intelligence, especial∣ly when I heard them mention the Names of se∣veral other great Generals, as the Prince of <HI>Hesse,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who, they said, were both running away. To which they added, what I entirely agreed with them in, That the Crown of <HI>France</HI> was very weak, but that the Mareschal
<PB N="129" REF="139"/>
<HI>Villars</HI> still kept his Colours. At last one of them told the Company, If they would go along with him, he would show them a Chimney-Sweeper and a Painted Lady in the same Bed, which he was sure would very much please them. The Shower which had driven them, as well as my self, into the House, was now over: And as they were passing by me into the Garden, I asked them to let me be one of their Company.</P>
<P>The Gentleman of the House told me, if I de∣lighted in Flowers, it would be worth my while, for that he believed he could show me such a Blow of Tulips as was not to be matched in the whole Country.</P>
<P>I accepted the Offer, and immediately found that they had been talking in Terms of Garden∣ing, and that the Kings and Generals they had mentioned were only so many Tulips, to which the Gardiners, according to their usual Custom, had given such high Titles and Appellations of Honour.</P>
<P>I was very much pleased and astonished at the glorious Show of these gay Vegetables, that arose in great Profusion on all the Banks about us. Sometimes I considered them with the Eye of an ordinary Spectator as so many beautiful Objects, varnished over with a natural Gloss, and stained with such a Variety of Colours, as are not to be equalled in any artificial Dyes or Tinctures. Sometimes I considered every Leaf as an elabo∣rate Piece of Tissue, in which the Threads and Fibres were woven together into different Confi∣gurations, which gave a different Colouring to the Light as it glanced on the several Parts of the Surface. Sometimes I considered the whole Bed of Tulips, according to the Notion of the greatest Mathematician and Philosopher that ever lived, as a Multitude of Optick Instruments, designed for the separating Light into all those various Co∣lours of which it is composed.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="140"/>
I was awakened out of these my Philosophical Speculations, by observing the Company often seemed to laugh at me. I accidentally praised a Tulip as one of the finest that I ever saw; upon which they told me, 'twas a common Fool's-Coat. Upon that I praised a Second, which it seems was but another Kind of Fool's-Coat. I had the same Fate with Two or Three more; for which Reason I desired the Owner of the Garden to let me know which were the finest of the Flowers, for that I was so unskilful in the Art, that I thought the most beautiful were the most valua∣ble, and that those which had the gayest Colours were the most beautiful. The Gentleman smiled at my Ignorance: He seemed a very plain honest Man, and a Person of good Sense, had not his Head been touched with that Distemper which <HI>Hippocrates</HI> calls the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Tulippomania;</HI> insomuch that he would talk very rationally on any Subject in the World but a Tulip.</P>
<P>He told me, That he valued the Bed of Flowers which lay before us, and was not above Twenty Yards in Length, and Two in Breadth, more than he would the best Hundred Acres of Land in <HI>England;</HI> and added, That it would have been worth twice the Money it is, if a foolish Cook-Maid of his had not almost ruined him the last Winter, by mistaking an Handful of Tulip-Roots for an Heap of Onions, and by that Means (says he) made me a Dish of Porridge, that cost me above 1000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling. He then showed me what he thought the finest of his Tulips, which I found received all their Value from their Rarity and Oddness, and put me in Mind of your great For∣tunes, which are not always the greatest Beau∣ties.</P>
<P>I have often looked upon it as a Piece of Hap∣piness, that I have never fallen into any of these fantastical Tasts, nor esteemed any Thing the more for its being uncommon and hard to be met
<PB N="131" REF="141"/>
with. For this Reason, I look upon the whole Country in Spring-time as a spacious Garden, and make as many Visits to a Spot of Daizies, or a Bank of Violets, as a Florist does to his Bor∣ders and Parterres. There is not a Bush in Blos∣som within a Mile of me which I am not ac∣quainted with, nor scarce a Daffodil or Cowslip that withers away in my Neighbourhood with∣out my missing it. I walked Home in this Tem∣per of Mind through several Fields and Meadows with an unspeakable Pleasure, not without re∣flecting on the Bounty of Providence, which has made the most pleasing and most beautiful Ob∣jects the most ordinary and most common.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>Sept. 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NEver were Men so perplexed as a select Com∣pany of us were this Evening with a Cou∣ple of professed Wits, who through our ill For∣tune, and their own Confidence, had thought fit to pin themselves upon a Gentleman who had owned to them that he was going to meet such and such Persons, and named us one by one. These pert Puppies immediately resolved to come with him, and from the Beginning to the End of the Night entertained each other with Imperti∣nencies, to which we were perfect Strangers. I am come Home very much tired; for the Affli∣ction
<PB N="132" REF="142"/>
was so irksome to me, that it surpasses all other I ever knew, insomuch that I cannot re∣flect upon this Sorrow with Pleasure, though it is past.</P>
<P>An easy Manner of Conversation is the most desirable Quality a Man can have; and for that Reason Coxcombs will take upon them to be fa∣miliar with People whom they never saw before. What adds to the Vexation of it is, that they will act upon the Foot of knowing you by Fame, and rally with you, as they call it, by repeating what your Enemies say of you; and court you, as they think, by uttering to your Face at a wrong Time all the kind Things your Friends speak of you in your Absence.</P>
<P>These People are the more dreadful, the more they have of what is usually called Wit: For a lively Imagination, when it is not governed by a good Understanding, makes such miserable Ha∣vock both in Conversation and Business, that it lays you defenceless, and fearful to throw the least Word in its Way, that may give it new Matter for its further Errors.</P>
<P><HI>Tom. Mercett</HI> has as quick a Fancy as any one li∣ving; but there is no reasonable Man can bear him half an Hour. His Purpose is to entertain, and it is of no Consequence to him what is said, so it be what is called well said; as if a Man must bear a Wound with Patience, because he that pushed at you came up with a good Air and Mien. That Part of Life which we spend in Company, is the most pleasing of all our Mo∣ments; and therefore I think our Behaviour in it should have its Laws as well as the Part of our Being, which is generally esteemed the more im∣portant. From hence it is, that from long Expe∣rience I have made it a Maxim. that however we may pretend to take Satisfaction in sprightly Mirth and high Jollity, there is no great Pleasure in any Company where the Basis of the Society
<PB N="133" REF="143"/>
is not mutual Good-Will. When this is in the Room, every trifling Circumstance, the most mi∣nute Accident, the Absurdity of a Servant, the Repetition of an old Story, the Look of a Man when he is telling it, the most indifferent and the most ordinary Occurrences, are Matters which produce Mirth and good Humour. I went to spend an Hour after this Manner with some Friends who enjoy it in Perfection whenever they meet, when those Destroyers above-mentioned came in upon us. There is not a Man among them has any Notion of Distinction of Superiori∣ty to one another, either in their Fortunes or their Talents, when they are in Company. Or if any Reflexion to the contrary occurs in their Thoughts, it only strikes a Delight upon their Minds, that so much Wisdom and Power is in Possession of one whom they love and esteem.</P>
<P>In these my Lucubrations, I have frequently dwelt upon this one Topick. It would make short Work for us Reformers, for it is only Want of making this a Position that renders some Cha∣racters bad, which would otherwise be good. <HI>Tom Mercett</HI> means no Man Ill, but does Ill to every Body. His Ambition is to be witty; and to carry on that Design, he breaks through all Things that other People hold Sacred. If he thought Wit was no Way to be used but to the Advantage of Society, that Sprightliness would have a new Turn, and we should expect what he is going to say with Satisfaction instead of Fear. It is no Excuse for being mischievous, that a Man is mischievous without Malice; nor will it be thought an Attonement that the Ill was done not to injure the Party concern'd, but to di∣vert the Indifferent.</P>
<P>It is, methinks, a very great Error, that we should not profess Honesty in Conversation as much as in Commerce. If we consider, that there is no greater Misfortune than to be ill re∣ceived
<PB N="134" REF="144"/>
where we love the turning a Man to Ridi∣cule among his Friends, we rob him of greater Enjoyments than he could have purchased by his Wealth; yet he that laughs at him, would per∣haps be the last Man who would hurt him in this Case of less Consequence. It has been said, the History of <HI>Don Quixote</HI> utterly destroyed the Spi∣rit of Gallantry in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation; and I be∣lieve we may say much more truly, that the Hu∣mour of Ridicule has done as much Injury to the true Relish of Company in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Such Satisfactions as arise from the secret Com∣parison of our selves to others, with relation to their inferior Fortunes or Merit, are mean and unworthy. The true and high State of Conver∣sation is when Men communicate their Thoughts to each other upon such Subjects, and in such a Manner, as would be pleasant if there were no such Thing as Folly in the World; for it is but a low Condition of Wit in one Man which de∣pends upon Folly in another.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I was here interrupted by the Receipt of my Letters, among which is one from a Lady, who is not a little offended at my Translation of the Discourse between <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve.</HI> She pre∣tends to tell me my own, as she calls it, and quotes several Passages in my Works which tend to the utter Disunion of Man and Wife. Her Epistle will best express her. I have made an Extract of it, and shall insert the most material Passages.</P>

<P>HAving received many Letters filled with Compliments and Acknowledgments for my late useful Discovery of the Political Barome∣ter, I shall here communicate to the Publick an Account of my Ecclesiastical Thermometer, the latter giving as manifest Prognostications of the Changes and Revolutions in Church, as the for∣mer does of those in State, and both of them be∣ing absolutely necessary for every prudent Subject who is resolved to keep what he has, and get what he can.</P>
<P>The Church Thermometer, which I am now to treat of, is supposed to have been invented in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, about the Time when that Religious Prince put some to Death for owning the Pope's Supremacy, and others for denying Transubstantiation. I do not find, how∣ever, any great Use made of this Instrument till it fell into the Hands of a learned and vigilant Priest or Minister, (for he frequently wrote him∣self both one and the other) who was some Time Vicar of <HI>Bray.</HI> This Gentleman lived in his Vi∣caridge to a good old Age; and after having seen several Successions of his neighbouring Clergy either burnt or banish'd, departed this Life with the Satisfaction of having never deserted his
<PB N="137" REF="147"/>
Flock, and died Vicar of <HI>Bray.</HI> As this Glass was first designed to calculate the different De∣grees of Heat in Religion, as it raged in Popery, or as it cooled and grew temperate in the Refor∣mation, it was marked at several Distances, after the Manner our ordinary Thermometer is to this Day, <HI>viz. Extream Hot sultry Hot, very Hot, Hot, Warm, Temperate, Cold, just Freezing, Frost, hard Frost, great Frost, extream Cold.</HI></P>
<P>It is well known, that <HI>Toricellius,</HI> the Inventor of the common Weather-Glass, made the Experi∣ment in a long Tube which held Thirty two Foot of Water; and that a more modern Virtuoso finding such a Machine altogether unweildy and useless, and considering that Thirty two Inches of Quicksilver weigh'd as much as so many Foot of Water in a Tube of the same Circumference, invented that fizeable Instrument which is now in Use. After this Manner, that I might adapt the Thermometer I am now speaking of to the present Constitution of our Church, as divided into <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Low,</HI> I have made some necessary Vari∣ations both in the Tube and the Fluid it contains. In the first Place, I ordered a Tube to be cast in a Planetary Hour, and took Care to seal it Her∣metically, when the Sun was in Conjunction with <HI>Saturn.</HI> I then took the proper Precautions about the Fluid, which is a Compound of Two very different Liquors; one of them a Spirit drawn out of a strong heady Wine; the other a parti∣cular Sort of Rock Water, colder than Ice, and clearer than Chrystal. The Spirit is of a red fiery Colour, and so very apt to ferment, that unless it be mingled with a Proportion of the Water, or pent up very close, it will burst the Vessel that holds it, and fly up in Fume and Smoak. The Water on the contrary is of such a subtle piercing Cold, that unless it be mingled with a Proportion of the Spirits, it will sink through almost every Thing that it is put into, and seems to be of the
<PB N="138" REF="148"/>
same Nature as the Water mentioned by <HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> which, says the Historian, could be con∣tained in nothing but in the Hoof or (as the <HI>Ox∣ford</HI> Manuscript has it) in the Skull of an Ass. The Thermometer is marked according to the following Figure, which I set down at length, not only to give my Reader a clear Idea of it, but also to fill up my Paper.<LIST>
<ITEM>Ignorance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Persecution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wrath.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Zeal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>CHURCH.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Moderation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lukewarmness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Infidelity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ignorance.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Reader will observe, that the Church is placed in the Middle Point of the Glass, between <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> the Situation in which she always flourishes, and in which every good <HI>Eng∣lishman</HI> wishes her who is a Friend to the Con∣stitution of his Country. However, when it mounts to <HI>Zeal,</HI> it is not amiss; and when it sinks to <HI>Moderation,</HI> is still in a most admirable Temper. The worst of it is, that when once it begins to rise, it has still an Inclination to ascend, insomuch that it is apt to climb from <HI>Zeal</HI> to <HI>Wrath,</HI> and from <HI>Wrath</HI> to <HI>Persecution,</HI> which al∣ways ends in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and very often proceeds from it. In the same Manner it frequently takes its Progress through the lower Half of the Glass; and when it has a Tendency to fall, will gradual∣ly descend from <HI>Moderation</HI> to <HI>Lukewarmness,</HI> and
<PB N="139" REF="149"/>
from <HI>Lukewarmness</HI> to <HI>Infidelity,</HI> which very often terminates in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and always proceeds from it.</P>
<P>It is a common Observation, that the ordinary Thermometer will be affected by the breathing of People who are in the Room where it stands; and indeed, it is almost incredible to conceive how the Glass I am now describing will fall by the Breath of a Multitude crying <HI>Popery;</HI> or on the contrary, how it will rise when the same Multi∣tude (as it sometimes happens) cry out in the same Breath, <HI>The Church is in Danger.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as I had finished this my Glass, and ad∣justed it to the above-mentioned Scale of Reli∣gion, that I might make proper Experiments with it, I carried it under my Cloak to several Coffee-houses, and other Places of Resort about this great City. At St. <HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-house, the Li∣quor stood at <HI>Moderation;</HI> but at <HI>Will</HI>'s, to my extream Surprize, it subsided to the very lowest Mark on the Glass. At the <HI>Grecian,</HI> it mounted but just one Point higher; at the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> it still ascended Two Decrees: <HI>Child</HI>'s fetched it up to <HI>Zeal,</HI> and other adjacent Coffee-houses to <HI>Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>It fell into the lower Half of the Glass as I went further into the City, till at length it set∣tled at <HI>Moderation,</HI> where it continued all the Time I stay'd about the <HI>Change,</HI> as also whilst I passed by the <HI>Bank.</HI> And here I cannot but take Notice, that through the whole Course of my Remarks, I never observed my Glass to rise at the same Time that the Stocks did.</P>
<P>To compleat the Experiment, I prevailed upon a Friend of mine, who works under me in the Occult Sciences, to make a Progress with my Glass through the whole Island of <HI>Great Bri∣tain;</HI> and after his Return, to present me with a Register of his Observations. I guessed before∣hand at the Temper of several Places he passed through, by the Characters they have had Time

out of Mind. Thus that facetious Divine, Dr. <HI>Ful∣ler,</HI> speaking of the Town of <HI>Banbury</HI> near a Hundred Years ago, tells us, it was a Place fa∣mous for Cakes and <HI>Zeal,</HI> which I find by my Glass is true to this Day as to the latter Part of this Description; though I must confess, it is not in the same Reputation for Cakes that it was in the Time of that learned Author; and thus of other Places. In short, I have now by me, di∣gested in an Alphabetical Order, all the Counties, Corporations and Boroughs, in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with their respective Tempers, as they stand re∣lated to my Thermometer: But this I shall keep to my self, because I would by no Means do any Thing that may seem to influence any ensuing Elections.</P>
<P>The Point of Doctrine which I would propa∣gate by this my Invention, is the same which was long ago advanced by that able Teacher <HI>Ho∣race,</HI> out of whom I have taken my Text for this Discourse: We should be careful not to over∣shoot our selves in the Pursuits even of Virtue. Whether <HI>Zeal</HI> or <HI>Moderation</HI> be the Point we aim at, let us keep Fire out of the one, and Frost out of the other. But alas! the World is too Wise to want such a Precaution. The Terms <HI>High-Church</HI> and <HI>Low-Church,</HI> as commonly used, do not so much denote a Principle, as they distin∣guish a Party. They are like Words of Battle, that have nothing to do with their original Sig∣nification, but are only given out to keep a Body of Men together, and to let them know Friends from Enemies.</P>
<P>I must confess, I have considered with some lit∣tle Attention the Influence which the Opinions of these great National Sects have upon their Pra∣ctice; and do look upon it as one of the unac∣countable Things of our Times, that Multitudes of honest Gentlemen, who entirely agree in their
<PB N="141" REF="151"/>
Lives, should take it in their Heads to differ in their Religion.</P>

<P>AS I was this Morning going out of my House, a little Boy in a black Coat delivered to me the following Letter. Upon asking who he was, he told me, that he belonged to my Lady <HI>Gim∣crack.</HI> I did not at first recollect the Name; but upon Enquiry, found it to be the Widow of Sir <HI>Nicholas,</HI> whose Legacy I lately gave some Account of to the World. The Letter ran thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope you will not be surprised to receive a Letter from the Widow <HI>Gimcrack.</HI> You know, Sir, that I have lately lost a very whim∣sical Husband, who I find, by one of your last Weeks Papers, was not altogether a Stranger to you. When I married this Gentleman, he had a very handsome Estate; but upon buying a Set of Microscopes, he was chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society; from which Time I do not remember ever to have heard him speak as other People did, or talk in a Manner that any of his Family could understand him. He used, however, to pass away his Time very in∣nocently in Conversation with several Mem∣ber;
<PB N="142" REF="152"/>
of that learned Body; for which Reason I never advised him against their Company for several Years, till at last I found his Brain was quite turned with their Discourses. The first Symptom which he discovered of his being a Virtuoso, as you call him, poor Man! was about Fifteen Years ago, when he gave me positive Orders to turn off an old Weeding-Woman that had been employed in the Family for several Years. He told me at the same Time, that there was no such Thing in Na∣ture as a Weed, and that it was his Design to let his Garden produce what it pleased; so that you may be sure it makes a very pleasant Show as it now lies. About the same Time he took a Humour to ramble up and down the Country, and would often bring Home with him his Pockets full of Moss and Pebbles. This you may be sure gave me a heavy Heart; though at the same Time I must needs say, he had the Character of a very honest Man, notwithstanding he was reckon'd a little weak, till he begun to sell his Estate, and buy those strange Baubles that you have taken Notice of. Upon <HI>Midsummer-Day</HI> last, as he was walking with me in the Fields, he saw a very odd coloured Butterfly just before us. I observed, that he immediately chan∣ged Colour, like a Man that is surprised with a Piece of good Luck, and telling me that it was what he had looked for above these Twelve Years, he threw off his Coat, and followed it. I lost Sight of them both in less than a quarter of an Hour; but my Husband continued the Chace over Hedge and Ditch till about Sun-set; at which Time, as I was afterwards told, he caught the Butterfly, as she rested her self upon a Cab∣bage, near Five Miles from the Place where he first put her up. He was here lifted
<PB N="143" REF="153"/>
from the Ground by some Passengers in a very fainting Condition, and brought Home to me about Midnight. His violent Exer∣cise threw him into a Fever, which grew upon him by Degrees, and at last carried him off. In one of the Intervals of his Di∣stemper, he called to me, and after having excused himself for running out of his E∣state, he told me, That he had always been more industrious to improve his Mind than his Fortune; and that his Family must ra∣ther value themselves upon his Memory as he was a wise Man, than a rich one. He then told me, That it was a Custom a∣mong the <HI>Romans,</HI> for a Man to give his Slaves their Liberty when he lay upon his Death-Bed. I could not imagine what this meant, till after having a little composed himself, he ordered me to bring him a Flea which he had kept for several Months in a Chain, with a Design, as he said, to give it its Ma∣numission. This was done accordingly. He then made the Will, which I have since seen printed in your Works Word for Word. On∣ly I must take Notice, that you have omitted the Codicil, in which he left a large <HI>Concha Veneris,</HI> as it is there called, to a Member of the Royal Society, who was often with him in his Sickness, and assisted him in his Will. And now, Sir, I come to the chief Bu∣siness of my Letter, which is, to desire your Friendship and Assistance in the Disposal of those many Rarities and Curiosities which lie upon my Hands. If you know any one that has an Occasion for a Parcel of dry'd Spiders, I will sell them a Pennyworth. I could like∣wise let any one have a Bargain of Cockle-Shells. I would also desire your Advice, whe∣ther I had best sell my Beetles in a Lump, or by Retail. The Gentleman above-mentioned,
<PB N="144" REF="154"/>
who was my Husband's Friend, would have me make an Auction of all his Goods, and is now drawing up a Catalogue of every Particu∣lar for that Purpose, with the Two following Words in great Letters over the Head of them, <HI>Auctio Gimcrackiana.</HI> But upon talking with him, I begin to suspect he is as mad as poor Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> was. Your Advice in all these Particulars, will be a great Piece of Charity to,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your most humble Servant, <HI>Elizabeth Gimcrack.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I shall answer the foregoing Letter, and give the Widow my best Advice, as soon as I can find out Chapmen for the Wares which she has to put off. In the mean Time, I shall give my Reader the Sight of a Letter which I have re∣ceived from another Female Correspondent by the same Post.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am convinced by a late Paper of yours, that a passionate Woman (which among the common People goes under the Name of a Scold) is one of the most unsupportable Creatures in the World. But alas! Sir, What can we do? I have made a Thou∣sand Vows and Resolutions every Morning to guard my self against this Frailty, but have generally broken them before Dinner, and could never in my Life hold out till the Second Course was set upon the Table.

<P>In Answer to this most unfortunate Lady, I must acquaint her, That there is now in Town an ingenious Physician of my Acquaintance, who undertakes to cure all the Vices and Defects of the Mind by inward Medicines, or outward Applica∣tions. I shall give the World an Account of his Patients and his Cures in other Papers, when I shall be more at Leisure to treat upon this Subject. I shall only here inform my Correspondent, That for the Benefit of such Ladies that are troubled with virulent Tongues, he has prepared a Cold Bath, over which there is fastened, at the End of a long Pole, a very convenient Chair, curious∣ly gilt and carved. When the Patient is seated in this Chair, the Doctor lifts up the Pole, and gives her Two or Three total Emersions in the Cold Bath, till such Time as she has quite lost the Use of Speech. This Operation so effectually chills the Tongue, and refrigerates the Blood, that a Woman, who at her Entrance into the Chair is extreamly passionate and sonorous, will come out as silent and gentle as a Lamb. The Doctor told me, he would not practise this Expe∣riment upon Women of Fashion, had not he seen it made upon those of meaner Condition with very good Effect.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>September 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHereas by Letters from <HI>Nottingham</HI> we have Advice, That the young Ladies of that Place complain for Want of Sleep, by rea∣son of certain riotous Lovers, who for this last Summer have very much infested the Streets of that eminent City with Violins and Bass-Viols, between the Hours of Twelve and Four in the Morning, to the great Disturbance of many of Her Majesty's peaceable Subjects. And whereas I have been im∣portuned to publish some Edict against these Mid∣night Alarms, which, under the Name of Sere∣nades, do greatly annoy many well-disposed Per∣sons, not only in the Place above-mentioned, but also in most of the Polite Towns of this Island.</P>
<P>I have taken that Matter into my serious Con∣sideration, and do find, that this Custom is by no means to be indulged in this Country and Cli∣mate.</P>
<P>It is indeed very unaccountable, that most of our <HI>British</HI> Youth should take such great Delight in these Nocturnal Expeditions. Your robust true-born <HI>Briton,</HI> that has not yet felt the Force of Flames and Darts, has a natural Inclination to break Windows; while th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se whose natural Rug∣gedness has been soothed and softened by gentle Passion, have as strong a Propensity to languish under them, especially if they have a Fidler be∣hind
<PB N="147" REF="157"/>
them to utter their Complaints: For as the Custom prevails at present, there is scarce a young Man of any Fashion in a Corporation who does not make Love with the Town-Musick. The Waits often help him through his Courtship; and my Friend Mr. <HI>Banister</HI> has told me, he was proffered Five hundred Pounds by a young Fellow to play, but for one Winter under the Window of a Lady that was a great Fortune, but more cruel than or∣dinary. One would think they hoped to conquer their Mistresses Hearts as People tame Hawks and Eagles, by keeping them awake, or breaking their Sleep when they are fallen into it.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to search into the Original of this impertinent Way of making Love, which, according to some Authors, is of great Anti∣quity. If we may believe Monsieur <HI>Dacier and</HI> other Criticks, <HI>Horace</HI>'s Tenth Ode of the Third Book was originally a Serenade. And if I was disposed to show my Learning, I could produce a Line of him in another Place, which seems to have been the Burthen of an old Heathen Sere∣nade.</P>
<Q><L>" — Audis minus &amp; minus jam</L>
<L>Me tuo tongas pereunte Noctes,</L>
<L>Lydia, Dormis?</L></Q>
<P>But notwithstanding the Opinions of many lear∣ned Men upon this Subject, I rather agree with them who look upon this Custom, as now practi∣sed, to have been introduced by castrated Musici∣ans, who found out this Way of applying them∣selves to their Mistresses at these Hours, when Men of hoarser Voices express their Passions in a more vulgar Method. It must be confessed, That your <HI>Italian</HI> Eunuchs do practise this Manner of Court∣ship to this Day.</P>
<P>But whoever were the Persons that first thought of the Serenade, the Authors of all Countries are unanimous in ascribing the invention to <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="158"/>
There are Two Circumstances which qualified that Country above all other for this Midnight Musick.</P>
<P>The first I shall mention, was the Softness of their Climate.</P>
<P>This gave the Lover Opportunities of being Abroad in the Air, or of lying upon the Earth whole Hours together, without Fear of Damps or Dews; but as for our Tramontain Lovers, when they begin their Midnight Complaint with,
<Q><L>My Lodging it is on the cold Ground,</L></Q> We are not to understand them in the Rigour of the Letter, since it would be impossible for a <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Swain to condole himself long in that Situa∣tion without really dying for his Mistress. A Man might as well serenade in <HI>Greenland</HI> as in our Re∣gion. <HI>Milton</HI> seems to have had in his Thoughts the Absurdity of these Northern Serenades in the Censure which he passes upon them:</P>
<Q><L>— Or Midnight Ball,</L>
<L>Or Serenede, which the Starv'd Lover sings</L>
<L>To his proud Fair, best quitted with Disdain.</L></Q>
<P>The Truth of it is, I have often pitied, in a Win∣ter Night, a Vocal Musician, and have attributed many of his Trills and Quavers to the Coldness of the Weather.</P>
<P>The second Circumstance which inclined the <HI>Lalians</HI> to this Custom, was that Musical Genius which is so universal among them. Nothing is more frequent in that Country, than to hear a Cobler working to an Opera Tune. You can scarce see a Porter that has not one Nail much longer than the rest, which you will find, upon Enquiry, is cherished for some Instrument. In short, there is not a Labourer, or Handicraft Man, that in the Cool of the Evening does not relieve himself with Solo's and Sonnata's.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="159"/>
The <HI>Italian</HI> fooths his Mistress with a plaintivee Voice, and bewails himself in such melting Mu∣sick, that the whole Neighbourhood sympathizes with him in his Sorrow.</P>
<Q><L>Qualis Populea maerens, Philomela, sub Umbra</L>
<L>Flet Noctem, Rame{que} sedens miserabile Carmen</L>
<L>Integrat, &amp; late moestis Loca Quaestibus implet.</L></Q>
<P>On the contrary, our honest Countrymen have so little an Inclination to Musick, that they sel∣dom begin to sing till they are drunk, which also is usually the Time when they are most disposed to serenade.</P>

<P>I HAVE been very much sollicited by <HI>Cla∣rinda, Flavia,</HI> and <HI>Lysetta,</HI> to reassume my Discourse concerning the Methods of disposing honourably the unmarried Part of the World, and taking off those Bars to it, Jointures and Settle∣ments, which are not only the greatest Impedi∣ments towards entring into that State, but also the frequent Causes of Disturst and Animosity in it after it is consummated. I have with very much Attention consider'd the Case; and among all the
<PB N="150" REF="160"/>
Observations that I have made thro' a long Course of Years, I have thought the Coldness of Wives to their Husbands, as well as Disrespect from Chil∣dren to Parents, to arise from this one Source. This Trade for Minds and Bodies in the Lump, without Regard to either, but as they are accom∣panied with such Sums of Money, and such Par∣ceis of Land, cannot but produce a Commerce between the Parties concerned suitable to the mean Motives upon which they at first came to∣gether. I have heretofore given an Account, that this Method of making Settlements, was first in∣vented by a griping Lawyer, who made Use of the covetous Tempers of the Parents of each Side to force Two young People into these vile Mea∣sures of Diffidence, for no other End but to en∣crease the Skins of Parchment, by which they were put into each other's Possession out of each other's Power. The Law of our Country has given an ample and generous Provision for the Wife, even the Third of the Husband's Estate, and left to her good Humour and his Gratitude the Expectation of further Provision; but the fantasti∣cal Method of going further, with relation to their Heirs, has a Foundation in nothing but Pride and Folly: For as all Men wish their Children as like themselves, and as much better as they can possi∣bly, it seems monstrous, that we should give out of our selves the Opportunities of rewarding and discouraging them according to their Deserts. This wise Institution has no more Sense in it, than if a Man should begin a Deed with, <Q REND="inline">"Whereas no Man living knows how long he shall conti∣nue to be a reasonable Creature, or an honest Man: And whereas I <HI>B.</HI> am going to enter in the State of Matrimony with Mrs. <HI>D.</HI> therefore I shall from henceforth make it indifferent to me, whether from this Time forward I shall be a Fool or a Knave: And therefore in full and per∣fect
<PB N="151" REF="161"/>
Health of Body, and as sound Mind, not knowing which of my Children will prove bet∣ter or worse, I give to my First-born, be he per∣verse, ungrateful, impious, or cruel, the Lump and Bulk of my Estate, and leave one Year's Purchase only to each of my younger Children, whether they shall be brave or beautiful, modest or honourable, from the Time of the Date hereof wherein I resign my Senses, and hereby promise to employ my Judgment no further in the Di∣stribution of my Worldly Goods from the Day of the Date hereof, hereby further confessing and covenanting, that I am from henceforth married, and dead in Law.'</Q></P>
<P>There is no Man that is conversant in modern Settlements, but knows this is an exact Transla∣tion of what is inserted in these Instruments. Men's Passions could only make them submit to such Terms; and therefore all unreasonable Bar∣gains in Marriage ought to be set aside, as well as Deeds extorted from Men under Force or in Prison, who are altogether as much Masters of their Actions as he that is possess'd with a violent Passion.</P>
<P>How strangely Men are sometimes partial to themselves, appears by the Rapine of him that has a Daughter's Beauty under his Direction. He will make no Scruple of using it to force from her Lo∣ver as much of his Estate as is worth 10000 <HI>l.</HI> and at the same Time, as a Justice on the Bench, will spare no Pains to get a Man hanged that has taken but a Horse from him.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped, the Legislature will in due Time take this Kind of Robbery into Considera∣tion, and not suffer Men to prey upon each other, when they are about making the most solemn League, and entring into the strictest Bonds. The only sure Remedy is to fix a certain Rate on every Woman's Fortune; one Price for that of a Maid,
<PB N="152" REF="162"/>
and another for a Widow: For it is of infinite Advantage, that there should be no Frauds or Un∣certainties in the Sale of our Women.</P>
<P>If any Man should exceed the settled Rate, he ought to be at Liberty after Seven Years are over, by which Time his Love may be supposed to abate a little, if it is not founded upon Reason, to re∣nounce the Bargain, and be freed from the Settle∣ment upon restoring the Portion; as a Youth mar∣ried under Fourteen Years old may be off if he pleases when he comes to that Age, and as a Man is discharged from all Bargains but that of Mar∣riage made when he is under Twenty one.</P>
<P>It grives me when I consider, that these Re∣straints upon Matrimony take away the Advan∣tage we should otherwise have over other Coun∣tries, which are sunk much by those great Checks upon Propagation, the Convents. It is thought chiefly owing to these that <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> want above half their Complement of People. Were the Price of Wives always fixed and settled, it would contribute to filling the Nation more than all the Encouragements that can possibly be given to Fo∣reigners to transplant themselves hither.</P>
<P>I therefore, as Censor of <HI>Britain,</HI> till a Law is made, will lay down Rules which shall be obser∣ved with Penalty of degrading all that break them into Pretty Fellows, Smarts, Squibs, Hunt∣ing Horns, Drums, and Bagpipes.</P>
<P>The Females that are guilty of breaking my Orders, I shall respectively pronounce to be Kits, Hornpipes, Dulcimers, and Kettle-Drums. Such Widows as wear the Spoils of one Husband I will bury, if they attempt to rob another.</P>
<P>I ordain, That no Woman ever demand one Shilling to be paid after her Husband's Death, more than the very Sum she brings him, or an Equivalent for it in Land.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="163"/>
That no Settlement be made, in which the Man settles on his Children more than the Reversion of the Jointure, or the Value of it in Money; so that at his Death he may in the Whole be bound to pay his Family but double to what he has receiv'd. I would have the eldest, as well as the rest, have his Provision out of this.</P>
<P>When Men are not able to come up to those Settlements I have proposed, I would have them receive so much of the Portion only as they can come up to, and the rest to go to the Woman by Way of Pin-Money, or Separate Maintenance. In this, I think, I determined equally between the Two Sexes.</P>
<P>If any Lawyer varies from these Rules, or is above Two Days in drawing a Marriage Settle∣ment, or uses more Words in it than one Skin of Parchment will contain, or takes above Five Pounds for drawing it, I would have him thrown over the Bar.</P>
<P>Were these Rules observed, a Woman with a small Fortune, and a great deal of Worth, would be sure to marry according to her Deserts, if the Man's Estate were to be less incumbered in Pro∣portion as her Fortune is less than he might have with others.</P>
<P>A Man of a great deal of Merit, and not much Estate, might be chosen for his Worth; because it would not be difficult for him to make a Settle∣ment.</P>
<P>The Man that loves a Woman best, would not lose her for not being able to bid so much as ano∣ther, or for not complying with an extravagant Demand.</P>
<P>A fine Woman would no more be set up to Auction as she is now. When a Man puts in for her, her Friends or her self take Care to publish it; and the Man that was the first Bidder is made no other Use of but to raise the Price. He that
<PB N="154" REF="164"/>
loves her, will continue in Waiting as long as she pleases, (if her Fortune be thought equal to his) and under Pretence of some Failure in the Rent-Roll, or Difficulties in drawing the Settlement, he is put off till a better Bargain is made with ano∣ther.</P>
<P>All the rest of the Sex that are not rich or beau∣tiful to the highest Degree are plainly Gainers, and would be married so fast, that the least charm∣ing of them would soon grow Beauties to the Bat∣chelors.</P>
<P>Widows might be easily married, if they would not, as they do now, set up for discreet, only by being mercenary.</P>
<P>The making Matimony cheap and easy, would be the greatest Discouragement to Vice: The li∣miting the Expence of Children would not make Men ill inclined, or afraid of having them in a regular Way; and the Men of Merit would not live unmarried, as they often do now, because the Goodness of a Wife cannot be ensured to them; out the Loss of an Estate is certain, and a Man would never have the Affliction of a worthless Heir added to that of a bad Wife.</P>
<P>I am the more serious, large, and particular on this Subject, because my Lucubrations designed for the Encouragement of Virtue, cannot have the desired Success as long as this Incumbrance of Set∣tlements continues upon Matrimony.</P>

<P>IT is my Custom, in a Dearth of News, to en∣tertain my self with those Collections of Ad∣vertisements that appear at the End of all our publick Prints. These I consider as Accounts of News from the little World, in the same Manner that the foregoing Parts of the Paper are from the great. If in one we hear that a Sovereign Prince is fled from his Capital City, in the other we hear of a Tradesman who hath shut up his Shop, and run away. If in one we find the Victory of a General, in the other we see the Desertion of a private Soldier. I must confess, I have a certain Weakness in my Temper, that is often very much affected by these little Domestick Occurrences, and have frequently been caught with Tears in my Eyes over a melancholy Advertisement.</P>
<P>But to consider this Subject in its most ridicu∣lous Lights, Advertisements are of great Use to the Vulgar: First of all, as they are Instruments of Ambition. A Man that is by no Means big enough for the <HI>Gazette,</HI> may easily creep into the Advertisements; by which Means we often see an Apothecary in the same Paper of News with a Plenipotentiary, or a Running-Footman with an Ambassador. An Advertisement from <HI>Pickadilly</HI> goes down to Posterity, with an Article from <HI>Ma∣drid;</HI> and <HI>John Bartlett</HI> of <HI>Goodman's-Fields</HI> is ce∣lebrated in the same Paper with the Emperor of
<PB N="156" REF="166"/>
<HI>Germany.</HI> Thus the Fable tells us, That the Wren mounted as high as the Eagle, by getting upon his Back.</P>
<P>A Second Use which this Sort of Writings have been turned to of late Years, has been the Manage∣ment of Controversy, insomuch that above half the Advertisements one meets with now-a-Days are purely Polemical. The Inventors of <HI>Strops for Razors</HI> have written against one another this Way for several Years, and that with great Bitterness; as the whole Argument <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> in the Case of the <HI>Morning-Gowns</HI> is still carried on after the same Manner. I need not mention the several Proprie∣tors of Dr. <HI>Anderson</HI>'s Pills; nor take Notice of the many Satyrical Works of this Nature so fre∣quently published by Dr. <HI>Clark,</HI> who has had the Confidence to advertise upon that learned Knight, my very worthy Friend, Sir <HI>William Read:</HI> But I shall not interpose in their Quarrel; Sir <HI>William</HI> can give him his own in Advertisements, that, in the Judgment of the Impartial, are as well penn'd as the Doctor's.</P>
<P>The Third and last Use of these Writings is, to inform the World where they may be furnished with almost every Thing that is necessary for Life. If a Man has Pains in his Head, Cholicks in his Bowels, or Spots in his Clothes, he may here meet with proper Cures and Remedies. If a Man would recover a Wife or a Horse that is stolen or stray'd; if he wants new Sermons, Electuaries, Asses Milk, or any Thing else, either for his Body or his Mind, this is the Place to look for them in.</P>
<P>The great Art in writing Advertisements, is the finding out a proper Method to catch the Reader's Eye; without which, a good Thing may pass over unobserved, or be lost among Commissions of Bankrupt. Asterisks and Hands were formerly of great Use for this Purpose. Of late Years, the <HI>N. B.</HI> has been much in Fashion; as also little Cuts and Figures, the Invention of which we must a∣scribe
<PB N="157" REF="167"/>
to the Author of Spring-Trusses. I must not here omit the blind <HI>Italian</HI> Character, which be∣ing scarce legible, always fixes and detains the Eye, and gives the curious Reader something like the Satisfaction of prying into a Secret.</P>
<P>But the great Skill in an Advertiser is chiefly seen in the Style which he makes use of. He is to mention <HI>the universal Esteem, or general Reputa∣tion,</HI> of Things that were never heard of. If he is a Physician or Astrologer, he must change his Lodgings frequently, and (tho' he never saw any Body in them besides his own Family) give pub∣lick Notice of it, <HI>For the Information of the Nobility and Gentry.</HI> Since I am thus usefully employ'd in writing Criticisms on the Works of these diminu∣tive Authors, I must not pass over in Silence an Advertisement which has lately made its Appea∣rance, and is written altogether in a <HI>Ciceronian</HI> Manner. It was sent to me, with Five Shillings, to be inserted among my Advertisements; but as it is a Pattern of good Writing in this Way, I shall give it a Place in the Body of my Paper.</P>
<Q>THE highest compounded Spirit of Lavender, the most glorious (if the Expression may be used) enlivening Scent and Flavour that can pos∣sibly be, which so raptures the Spirits, delights the Gust, and gives such Airs to the Countenance, as are not to be imagined but by those that have tried it. The meanest Sort of the Thing is admi∣red by most Gentlemen and Ladies; but this far more, as by far it exceeds it, to the gaining among all a more than common Esteem. It is sold (in neat Flint Bottles fit for the Pocket) only at the Golden-Key in Warton's-Court near Holborn-Bars, for 3 s. 6 d. with Directions.</Q>
<P>At the same Time that I recommend the several Flowers in which this Spirit of Lavender is wrap∣ped up, (if the Expression may be used) I cannot
<PB N="158" REF="168"/>
excuse my Fellow-Labourers for admitting into their Papers several uncleanly Advertisements, not at all proper to appear in the Works of polite Wri∣ters. Among these I must reckon the <HI>Carminitive Wind expelling</HI> Pills. If the Doctor had called them only his Carminitive Pills, he had been as cleanly as one could have wished; but the Second Word entirely destroys the Decency of the First. There are other Absurdities of this Nature so very gross, that I dare not mention them; and shall therefore dismiss this Subject with a publick Ad∣monition to <HI>Michael Parrot,</HI> That he do not pre∣sume any more to mention a certain Worm he knows of, which, by the Way, has grown Seven Foot in my Memory; for, if I am not much mi∣staken, it is the same that was but Nine Foot long about Six Months ago.</P>
<P>By the Remarks I have here made, it plainly ap∣pears, that a Collection of Advertisements is a kind of Miscellany; the Writers of which, contra∣ry to all Authors, except Men of Quality, give Money to the Booksellers who publish their Co∣pies. The Genius of the Bookseller is chiefly shown in his Method of ranging and digesting these little Tracts. The last Paper I took up in my Hands, places them in the following Order:<LIST>

<P>THE Hours which we spend in Conversation are the most pleasing of any which we en∣joy; yet, methinks, there is very little Care ta∣ken to improve our selves for the frequent Repe∣tition of them. The common Fault in this Case, is that of growing too intimate, and falling into displeasing Familiarities: For it is a very ordinary Thing for Men to make no other Use of a close Acquaintance with each other's Affairs, but to teaze one another with unacceptable Allusions. One would pass over patiently such as converse like Animals, and salute each other with Bangs on the Shoulder, sly Raps with Canes, or other robust Pleasantries practised by the rural Gentry of this Nation: But even among those who should have more polite Idea's of Things, you see a Set of People who invert the Design of Conversa∣tion, and make frequent Mention of ungrateful Subjects; nay, mention them because they are ungrateful; as if the Perfection of Society were in knowing how to offend on the one Part, and how to bear an Offence on the other. In all Parts of this populous Town you find the merry World made up of an active and a passive Companion; one who has good-nature enough to suffer all his Friend shall think fit to say, and one who is re∣solved to make the most of his Good-humour to show his Parts. In the Trading Part of Mankind,
<PB N="160" REF="170"/>
I have ever observed the Jest went by the Weight of Purses, and the Ridicule is made up by the Gains which arise from it. Thus the Packer al∣lows the Clothier to say what he pleases, and the Broker has his Countenance ready to laugh with the Merchant, tho' the Abuse is to fall on him∣self, because he knows that, as a Go-between, he shall find his Account in being in the good Graces of a Man of Wealth. Among these just and punctual People, the richest Man is ever the bet∣ter Jester; and they know no such Thing as a Person who shall pretend to a superior Laugh at a Man, who does not make him Amends by Op∣portunities of Advantage in another Kind: But among People of a different Way, where the pretended Distinction in Company is only what is raised from Sense and Understanding, it is very absurd to carry on a rough Raillery so far, as that the whole Discourse should turn upon each others Infirmities, Follies, or Misfortunes.</P>
<P>I was this Evening with a Set of Wags of this Class. They appear generally by Two and Two; and what is most extraordinary, is, that those very Persons who are most together, appear least of a Mind when joined by other Company. This Evil proceeds from an indiscreet Familiarity, whereby a Man is allowed to say the most gra∣ting Thing imaginable to another, and it shall be accounted Weakness to show an Impatience for the Unkindness. But this and all other Devia∣tions from the Design of pleasing each other when we meet, are derived from Interlopers in Society, who want Capacity to put in a Stock among re∣gular Companions, and therefore supply their Wants by stale Histories, sly Observations, and rude Hints, which relate to the Conduct of others. All Cohabitants in general run into this unhappy Fault; Men and their Wives break into Re∣flections, which are like so much <HI>Arabick</HI> to the rest of the Company; Sisters and Brothers often
<PB N="161" REF="171"/>
make the like Figure from the same unjust Sense of the Art of being intimate and familiar. It is often said, such an one cannot stand the Mention of such a Circumstance: If he cannot, I am sure it is for Want of Discourse, or a worse Reason, that any Companion of his touches upon it.</P>
<P>Familiarity, among the truly Well-bred, never give Authority to trespass upon one another in the most minute Circumstance, but it allows to be kinder than we ought otherwise presume to be. <HI>Eusebius</HI> has Wit, Humour, and Spirit; but there never was a Man in his Company who wished he had less, for he understands Familiarity so well, that he knows how to make Use of it in a Way that neither makes himself or his Friend con∣temptible; but if any one is lessened by his Free∣dom, it is he himself, who always likes the Place, the Diet, and the Reception, when he is in the Company of his Friends. Equality is the Life of Conversation; and he is as much out who assumes to himself any Part above another, as he who considers himself below the rest of the Society. Familiarity in Inferiors is Sauciness; in Superiors, Condescension; neither of which are to have Being among Companions, the very Word implying that they are to be equal. When therefore we have abstracted the Company from all Considerations of their Quality or Fortune, it will immediately appear, that to make it happy and polite, there must nothing be started which shall discover that our Thoughts run upon any such Distinctions. Hence it will arise, that Be∣nevolence must become the Rule of Society, and he that is most obliging, must be most diverting.</P>
<P>This Way of Talking I am fallen into from the Reflection that I am wherever I go entertained with some Absurdity, Mistake, Weakness, or ill Luck of some Man or other, whom not only I, but the Person who makes me those Relations has a Value for. It would therefore be a great Be∣nefit
<PB N="162" REF="172"/>
to the World, if it could be brought to pass that no Story should be a taking one, but what was to the Advantage of the Person of whom it is related. By this Means, he that is now a Wit in Conversation, would be considered as a Sprea∣der of false News is in Business.</P>
<P>But above all, to make a Familiar fit for a Bo∣som Friend, it is absolutely necessary that we should always be inclined rather to hide than rally each others Infirmities. To suffer for a Fault, is a Sort of Attonement; and no Body is concerned for the Offence for which he has made Repara∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I have received the following Letter, which rallies me for being witty sooner than I designed; but I have now altered my Resolution, and intend to be facetious till the Day in <HI>October</HI> heretofore mentioned, instead of beginning for that Day.</P>

<P>IT is one of the Designs of this Paper to trans∣mit to Posterity an Account of every Thing that is monstrous in my own Times. For this Reason I shall here publish to the World the Life of a Person who was neither Man nor Woman, as written by one of my ingenious Correspon∣dents, who seems to have imitated <HI>Plutach</HI> in that multifarious Erudition, and those occasional Differtation, which he has wrought into the Bo∣dy of his History. The Life I am putting out, is that of <HI>Margery, alias John Young,</HI> commonly known by the Name of Dr. <HI>Young,</HI> who (as the Town very well knows) was a Woman that practised Physick in Man's Clothes, and after ha∣ving
<PB N="164" REF="174"/>
had Two Wives and several Children, died about a Month since.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here make bold to trouble you with a short Account of the famous Dr. <HI>Young</HI>'s Life, which you may call (if you please) a Second Part of the Farce of the <HI>Sham Doctor.</HI> This perhaps will not seem so strange to you, who (if I am not mistaken) have somewhere men∣tioned with Honour your Sister <HI>Kirleus</HI> as a Practitioner both in Physick and Astrology: But in the common Opinion of Mankind, a She-Quack is altogether as strange and astonishing a Creature as the Centaur that practis'd Physick in the Days of <HI>Achilles,</HI> or as King <HI>Phys</HI> in the <HI>Rehearsal. Aesculapius,</HI> the great Founder of your Art, was particularly famous for his Beard, as we may conclude from the Behaviour of a Tyrant, who is branded by Heathen Histo∣rians as guilty both of Sacrilege and Blasphe∣my, having robbed the Statue of <HI>Aesculapius</HI> of a thick bushy Golden Beard, and then alledged for his Excuse, <HI>That it was a Shame the Son should have a Beard when his Father</HI> Apollo <HI>had none.</HI> This latter Instance indeed seems some∣thing to favour a Female Professor, since (as I have been told) the ancient Statues of <HI>Apollo</HI> are generally made with the Head and Face of a Woman: Nay, I have been credibly informed by those who have seen them both, that the famous <HI>Apollo</HI> in the <HI>Belvidera</HI> did very much re∣semble Dr. <HI>Young.</HI> Let that be as it will, the Doctor was a Kind of <HI>Amazon</HI> in Physick, that made as great Devastations and Slaughters as any of our chief Heroes in the Art, and was as fatal to the <HI>English</HI> in these our Days, as the famous <HI>Jean d' Arc</HI> was in those of our Forefathers.</P>
<P>I do not find any Thing remarkable in the Life I am about to write till the Year 1695, at
<PB N="165" REF="175"/>
which Time the Doctor, being about Twenty three Years old, was brought to Bed of a Ba∣stard Child. The Scandal of such a Misfor∣tune gave so great Uneasiness to pretty Mrs. <HI>Peg∣gy,</HI> (for that was the Name by which the Doctor was then called) that she left her Fami∣ly, and followed her Lover to <HI>London,</HI> with a fixed Resolution some Way or other to recover her lost Reputation: But instead of changing her Life, which one would have expected from so good a Disposition of Mind, she took it in her Head to change her Sex. This was soon done by the Help of a Sword and a Pair of Breeches. I have Reason to believe, that her first Design was to turn Man-Midwife, having her self had some Experience in those Affairs: But thinking this too narrow a Foundation for her future Fortune, she at length bought her a Gold Button Coat, and set up for a Physician. Thus we see the same fatal Miscarriage in her Youth made Mrs. <HI>Young</HI> a Doctor, that former∣ly made one of the same Sex a Pope.</P>
<P>The Doctor succeeded very well in his Busi∣ness at first, but very often met with Accidents that disquieted him. As he wanted that deep magisterial Voice which gives Authority to a Prescription, and is absolutely necessary for the right Pronouncing of those Words, <HI>Take these Pills,</HI> he unfortunately got the Nickname of the <HI>Squeaking Doctor.</HI> If this Circumstance alarmed the Doctor, there was another that gave him no small Disquiet, and very much diminished his Gains. In short, he found him∣self run down as a superficial prating Quack, in all Families that had at the Head of them a cautious Father, or a jealous Husband. These would often complain among one another, that they did not like such a Smock-faced Physician; though in Truth had they known how justly he deserved that Name, they would rather have
<PB N="166" REF="176"/>
favoured his Practice, than have apprehended any Thing from it.</P>
<P>Such were the Motives that determined Mrs. <HI>Young</HI> to change her Condition, and take in Marriage a virtuous young Woman, who lived with her in good Reputation, and made her the Father of a very pretty Girl. But this Part of her Happiness was soon after destroyed by a Distemper which was too hard for our Physician, and carried off his first Wife. The Doctor had not been a Widow long, before he married his Second Lady, with whom also he lived in very good Understanding. It so hap∣pened, that the Doctor was with Child at the same Time that his Lady was; but the little ones coming both together, they passed for Twins. The Doctor having entirely establish∣ed the Reputation of his Manhood, especially by the Birth of the Boy of whom he had been lately delivered, and who very much resembles him, grew into good Business, and was particu∣larly famous for the Cure of Venereal Distem∣pers; but would have had much more Practice among his own Sex, had not some of them been so unreasonable as to demand certain Proofs of their Cure, which the Doctor was not able to give them. The florid blooming Look, which gave the Doctor some Uneasiness at first, in∣stead of betraying his Person, only recommend∣ed his Physick. Upon this Occasion I cannot forbear mentioning what I thought a very a∣greeable Surprize in one of <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Plays, where a young Woman applies her self to a sick Person in the Habit of a Quack, and speaks to her Patient, who was something scandalized at the Youth of his Physician, to the following Purpose—<HI>I begun to practise in the Reign of</HI> Francis I. <HI>and am now in the Hundred and fifti∣eth Year of my Age; but, by the Vertue of my Medicaments, have maintained my self in the</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="177"/>
<HI>same Beauty and Freshness I had at Fifteen.</HI> For this Reason <HI>Hippocrates</HI> lays it down as a Rule, That a Student in Physick should have a sound Constitution, and a healthy Look; which in∣deed seem as necessary Qualifications for a Physician, as a good Life, and virtuous Beha∣viour, for a Divine. But to return to our Sub∣ject. About Two Years ago the Doctor was very much afflicted with the Vapours, which grew upon him to such a Degree, that about six Weeks since they made an End of him. His Death discovered the Disguise he had acted un∣der, and brought him back again to his former Sex. 'Tis said, that at his Burial the Pall was held up by Six Women of some Fashion. The Doctor left behind him a Widow, and Two Fa∣therless Children, if they may be called so, be∣sides the little Boy before-mentioned. In rela∣tion to whom we may say of the Doctor, as the good old Ballad about <HI>The Children in the Wood</HI> says of the Unnatural Unkle, that he was Father and Mother both in one. These are all the Circumstances that I could learn of Doctor <HI>Young</HI>'s Life, which might have given Occasion to many obscene Fictions: But as I know those would never have gained a Place in your Paper, I have not troubled you with any Impertinence of that Nature; having stuck to the Truth ve∣ry scrupulously, as I always do when I sub∣scribe my self,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I shall add, as a Postcript to this Letter, that I am informed, the famous <HI>Saltero,</HI> who sells Cof∣fee in his Musaeum at <HI>Chelsea,</HI> has by him a Cu∣riosity which helped the Doctor to carry on his Imposture, and will give great Satisfaction to the curious Inquirer.</P>

<P>IT is the Business of Reason and Philosophy to sooth and allay the Passions of the Mind, or turn them to a vigorous Prosecution of what is dictated by the Understanding. In order to this good End, I would keep a watchful Eye upon the growing Inclinations of Youth, and be parti∣cularly careful to prevent their indulging them∣selves in such Sentiments as may imbitter their more advanced Age. I have now under Cure a young Gentleman, who lately communicated to me, that he was of all Men living the most mise∣rably envious. I desired the Circumstances of his Distemper; upon which, with a Sigh that would have moved the most inhumane Breast, <Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> said he, I am Nephew to a Gen∣tleman of a very great Estate, to whose Favour I have a Cousin that has equal Pretensions with my self. This Kinsman of mine is a young Man of the highest Merit imaginable, and has a Mind so tender, and so generous, that I can observe he returns my Envy with Pity. He makes me upon all Occasions the most obliging Condescensions: And I cannot but take Notice of the Concern he is in to see my Life blasted with this racking Passion, though it is against himself. In the Presence of my Unkle, when I am in the Room, he never speaks so well as he is capable of, but always lowers his Talents and Accomplishments out of Regard to me.
<PB N="169" REF="179"/>
What I beg of you, dear Sir, is to instruct me how to love him, as I know he does me: And I beseech you, if possible, to set my Heart right, that it may no longer be tormented where it should be pleased, or hate a Man whom I can∣not but approve.</Q></P>
<P>The Patient gave me this Account with such Candour and Openness, that I conceived imme∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iate Hopes of his Cure; because in Diseases of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Mind, the Person affected is half recovered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen he is sensible of his Distemper. Sir, said I, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Acknowledgment of your Kinsman's Merit is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very hopeful Symptom; for it is the Nature of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersons afflicted with this Evil, when they are in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urable, to pretend a Contempt of the Person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvied, if they are taxed with that Weakness. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an who is really envious, will not allow he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o; but upon such an Accusation is tormented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith the Reflection, that to envy a Man is to al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow him your Superior. But in your Case, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou examine the Bottom of your Heart, I am apt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o think it is Avarice, which you mistake for En∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. Were it not that you have both Expectations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the same Man, you would look upon your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousin's Accomplishments with Pleasure. You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat now consider him as an Obstacle to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterest, would then behold him as an Ornament <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o your Family. I observed my Patient upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccasion recover himself in some Measure; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e owned to me, that he hoped it was as I ima∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined; for that in all Places but where he was his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ival, he had Pleasure in his Company. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as the first Discourse we had upon this Malady; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd I do not doubt but, after Two or Three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore, I shall by just Degrees soften his Envy into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mulation.</P>
<P>Such an Envy as I have here described, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ossibly creep into an ingenuous Mind; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvy which makes a Man uneasy to himself and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hers, is a certain Distortion and Perverseness of
<PB N="170" REF="180"/>
Temper, that renders him unwilling to be pleas'd with any Thing without him that has either Beau∣ty or Perfection in it. I look upon it as a Distem∣per in the Mind, (which I know no Moralist that has described in this Light) when a Man cannot discern any Thing which another is Master of that is agreeable. For which Reason, I look up∣on the good-natured Man to be endowed with a certain discerning Faculty which the Envious are altogether deprived of. Shallow Wits, superficial Criticks, and conceited Fops, are with me so ma∣ny blind Men in respect of Excellencies. They can behold nothing but Faults and Blemishes, and indeed see nothing that is worth seeing. Show them a Poem, it is Stuff; a Picture, it is Daubing. They find nothing in Architecture that is not ir∣regular, or in Musick that is not out of Tune. These Men should consider, that it is their Envy which deforms every Thing, and that the Ugli∣ness is not in the Object, but in the Eye. And as for nobler Minds, whose Merits are either not discovered, or are misrepresented by the envious Part of Mankind, they should rather consider their Defamers with Pity than Indignation. A Man cannot have an Idea of Perfection in ano∣ther, which he was never sensible of in himself. Mr. <HI>Lock</HI> tells us, That upon asking a blind Man, What he thought Scarlet was? He answered, That he believed it was like the Sound of a Trumpet. He was forced to form his Conceptions of Idea's which he had not, by those which he had. In the same Manner, ask an envious Man, What he thinks of Virtue? He will call it Design: What of Good∣nature? And he will term it Dulness. The Diffe∣rence is, That as the Person before-mentioned was born blind, your envious Men have con∣tracted the Distemper themselves, and are trou∣bled with a Sort of an acquired Blindness. Thus the Devil in <HI>Milton,</HI> tho' made an Angel of Light, could see nothing to please him even in Para∣dise,

and hated our First Parents, though in their State of Innocence.</P>

<P>I Have long been of the Number of your Ad∣mirers, and take this Opportunity of telling you so. I know not why a Man so famed for Astrological Observations may not be also a good Casuist, upon which Presumption, 'tis I ask your Advice in an Affair that at present puzzles quite that slender Stock of Divinity I am Master of. I have now been some Time in Holy Orders, and Fellow of a certain College

in one of the Universities; but weary of that unactive Life, I resolve to be doing Good in my Generation. A worthy Gentleman has lately offer'd me a fat Rectory, but means, I perceive, his Kinswoman should have the Benefit of the Clergy. I am a Novice in the World, and con∣fess, it startles me how the Body of Mrs. <HI>Abi∣gail</HI> can be annexed to Cure of Souls. Sir, would you give us in one of your <HI>Tatlers</HI> the Original and Progress of Smock-Simony, and shew us, that where the Laws are silent, Men's Consciences ought to be so too; you could not more oblige our Fraternity of young Divines, and among the rest,</P>

<P>I Have now finished my Almanack for the next Year, in all the Parts of it except that which concerns the Weather; and you having shewn your self, by some of your late Works, more Weatherwise than any of our modern Astrologers, I most humbly presume to trouble you upon this Head. You know very well, that in our ordinary Almanacks the Wind and Rain, Snow and Hail, Clouds and Sun-shine, have their proper Seasons, and come up as regularly
<PB N="173" REF="183"/>
in their several Months as the Fruits and Plants of the Earth. As for my own Part, I freely own to you, that I generally steal my Weather out of some antiquated Almanack, that foretold it several Years ago. Now, Sir, what I hum∣bly beg of you is, that you would lend me your State Weather-Glass, in order to fill up this vacant Column in my Works. This, I know, would sell my Almanack beyond any other, and make me a richer Man than <HI>Poor Robin.</HI> If you will not grant me this Favour, I must have Recourse to my old Method, and will copy after an Almanack which I have by me, and which I think was made for the Year when the great Storm was. I am,</P>

<P>This Gentleman does not consider, what a strange Appearance his Almanack would make to the Ignorant, should he transpose his Weather, as he must do, did he follow the Dictates of my Glass. What would the World say to see Sum∣mers filled with Clouds and Storms, and Winters with Calms and Sun-shine, according to the Va∣riations of the Weather, as they might acciden∣tally appear in a State Barometer? But let that be as it will, I shall apply my own Invention to my own Use; and if I do not make my Fortune by it, it will be my own Fault.</P>

<P>THE whole Creation preys upon it self: E∣very living Creature is inhabited. A Flea has a Thousand invisible Insects that teaze him as he jumps from Place to Place, and revenge our Quarrels upon him. A very ordinary Microscope shows us, that a Louse is it self a very lousy Creature. A Whale, besides those Seas and O∣ceans in the several Vessels of his Body, which are filled with innumerable Shoals of little Ani∣mals, carries about it a whole World of Inhabi∣tants; insomuch that, if we believe the Calcula∣tions some have made, there are more living Creatures which are too small for the naked Eye to behold about the Leviathan, than there are of visible Creatures upon the Face of the whole Earth. Thus every nobler Creature is as it were the Basis and Support of Multitudes that are his Inferiors.</P>
<P>This Consideration very much comforts me, when I think on those numberless Vermin that feed upon this Paper, and find their Sustenance out of it: I mean, the small Wits and Scribble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> that every Day turn a Penny by nibbling at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lucubrations.

I would have these Gentlemen take Care that I do not serve them after the same Manner; for though I have hitherto kept my Temper pretty well, it is not impossible but I may some Time or other disap∣pear; and what will then become of them? Should I lay down my Paper, What a Famine would there be among the Hawkers, Printers, Booksellers, and Authors?

<P>This Letter is in every Point an admirable Pat∣tern of the present polite Way of Writing, nor is it of less Authority for being an Epistle: You may gather every Flower in it, with a Thousand more of equal Sweetness, from the Books, Pam∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lets, and single Papers, offered us every Day in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Coffee-houses: And these are the Beauties in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ced to supply the Want of Wit, Sense, Hu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> and Learning, which formerly were look∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n as Qualifications for a Writer.

How would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>le to read this Letter? And after he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ugh that Difficulty, how would he be
<PB N="181" REF="191"/>
able to understand it? The first Thing that strikes your Eye, is the <HI>Breaks</HI> at the End of almost every Sentence, of which I know not the Use, only that it is a Refinement, and very frequently practised. Then you will observe the Abbrevia∣tions and Elisions, by which Consonants of most obdurate Sound are joined together, without one softening Vowel to intervene; and all this only to make one Syllable of Two, directly contrary to the Example of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> alto∣gether of the <HI>Gothick</HI> Strain, and a natural Ten∣dency towards relapsing into Barbarity, which delights in Monosyllables, and uniting of Mute Consonants, as it is observable in all the Nor∣thern Languages. And this is still more visible in the next Refinement, which consists in pro∣nouncing the first Syllable in a Word that has many, and dismissing the rest; such as <HI>Phizz, Hipps, Mobb, Pozz, Rep,</HI> and many more, when we are already overloaded with Monosyllables, which are the Disgrace of our Language. Thus we cram one Syllable, and cut off the rest, as the Owl fattened her Mice after she had bit off their Legs, to prevent them from running away; and if ours be the same Reason for maiming our Words, it will certainly answer the End, for I am sure no other Nation will desire to borrow them. Some Words are hitherto but fairly split, and therefore only in their Way to Perfection; as <HI>Incog,</HI> and <HI>Plenipo:</HI> But in a short Time, 'tis to be hoped, they will be further dock'd to <HI>Inc.</HI> and <HI>Plen.</HI> This Reflection has made me of late Years very impatient for a Peace, which I believe would save the Lives of many brave Words, as well as Men. The War has introduced abun∣dance of Polysyllables, which will never be able to live many more Campaigns. <HI>Speculations, Operations, Preliminaries, Ambassadors, Pallisa∣does, Communication, Circumvallation, Battalions,</HI> as numerous as they are, if they attack us too
<PB N="182" REF="192"/>
frequently in our Coffee-houses, we shall certain∣ly put them to Flight, and cut off the Rear.</P>
<P>The Third Refinement observable in the Letter I send you, consists in the Choice of certain Words invented by some <HI>pretty Fellows,</HI> such as <HI>Banter, Bamboozle, Country Put,</HI> and <HI>Kidney,</HI> as it is there applied, some of which are now strug∣gling for the Vogue, and others are in Possession of it. I have done my utmost for some Years past to stop the Progress of <HI>Mobb</HI> and <HI>Banter,</HI> but have been plainly born down by Numbers, and betrayed by those who promised to assist me.</P>
<P>In the last Place, you are to take Notice of cer∣tain choice Phrases scattered through the Letter, some of them tolerable enough, till they were worn to Rags by servile Imitators. You might easily find them, though they were not in a dif∣ferent Print, and therefore I need not disturb them.</P>
<P>These are the false Refinements in our Style which you ought to correct: First, by Argument and fair Means; but if those fail, I think you are to make Use of your Authority as Censor, and by an Annual <HI>Index Expurgatorius</HI> expunge all Words and Phrases that are offensive to good Sense, and condemn those barbarous Mutilations of Vowels and Syllables. In this last Point, the usual Pretence is, That they spell as they speak: A noble Standard for Language! To depend up∣on the Caprice of every Coxcomb, who because Words are the Cloathing of our Thoughts, cuts them out and shapes them as he pleases, and changes them oftner than his Dress. I believe all reasonable People would be content that such Refiners were more sparing in their Words, and liberal in their Syllables: And upon this Head, I should be glad you would bestow some Advice upon several young Readers in our Churches, who coming up from the University full fraight
<PB N="183" REF="193"/>
with Admiration of our Town Politeness, will needs correct the Style of their Prayer-Books. In reading the Absolution, they are very careful to say <HI>Pardons</HI> and <HI>Absolves;</HI> and in the Prayer for the Royal Family, it must be <HI>endue'um, enrich'um, prosper'um,</HI> and <HI>bring'um.</HI> Then in their Ser∣mons they use all the modern Terms of Art, <HI>Sham, Banter, Mob, Bubble, Bully, Cutting, Shuf∣fling,</HI> and <HI>Palming;</HI> all which, and many more of the like Stamp, as I have heard them often in the Pulpit from such young Sophisters, so I have read them in some of <HI>those Sermons that have made most Noise of late.</HI> The Design, it seems, is to avoid the dreadful Imputation of Pedantry; to shew us, that they know the Town, understand Men and Manners, and have not been poring upon old unfashionable Books in the Uni∣versity.</P>
<P>I should be glad to see you the Instrument of introducing into our Style that Simplicity which is the best and truest Ornament of most Things in Life, which the politer Ages always aimed at in their Building and Dress, <HI>(Simplex Munditiis)</HI> as well as their Productions of Wit. 'Tis mani∣fest, that all new affected Modes of Speech, whe∣ther borrowed from the Court, the Town, or the Theatre, are the first perishing Parts in any Language; and, as I could prove by many Hun∣dred Instances, have been so in ours. The Wri∣tings of <HI>Hooker,</HI> who was a Country Clergyman, and of <HI>Parsons</HI> the Jesuit, both in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> are in a Style that, with very few Allowances, would not offend any present Reader; much more clear and intelligible than those of Sir <HI>H. Wootton,</HI> Sir <HI>Rob.

<P>THere are very many ill Habits that might with much Ease have been prevented, which, after we have indulged our selves in them, be∣come incorrigible. We have a sort of Proverbial Expression, of <HI>taking a Woman down in her Wed∣ding Shoes,</HI> if you would bring her to Reason. An early Behaviour of this Sort, had a very re∣markable good Effect in a Family wherein I was several Years an intimate Acquaintance.</P>
<P>A Gentleman in <HI>Lincolushire</HI> had Four Daugh∣ters, Three of which were early married very happily; but the Fourth, though no Way inferior to any of her Sisters, either in Person or Accom∣plishments, had from her Infancy discovered so imperious a Temper, (usually called a High Spi∣rit) that it continually made great Uneasiness in the Family, became her known Character in the Neighbourhood, and deterred all her Lovers from declaring themselves. However, in Process of Time, a Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune and
<PB N="185" REF="195"/>
long Acquaintance, having observed that Quick∣ness of Spirit to be her only Fault, made his Ad∣dresses, and obtained her Consent in due Form. The Lawyers finished the Writings, (in which, by the Way, there was no Pin-Money) and they were married. After a decent Time spent in the Father's House, the Bridegroom went to prepare his Seat for her Reception. During the whole Course of his Courtship, though a Man of the most equal Temper, he had artificially lamented to her, that he was the most passionate Creature breathing. By this one Intimation, he at once made her understand Warmth of Temper to be what he ought to pardon in her, as well as that he alarmed her against that Constitution in him∣self. She at the same Time thought her self high∣ly obliged by the composed Behaviour which he maintained in her Presence. Thus far he with great Success soothed her from being guilty of Violences, and still resolved to give her such a terrible Apprehension of his fiery Spirit, that she should never dream of giving Way to her own. He returned on the Day appointed for carrying her Home; but instead of a Coach and Six Horses, together with the gay Equipage suitable to the Occasion, he appeared without a Servant, mounted on the Skeleton of a Horse which his Huntsman had the Day before brought in to feast his Dogs on the Arrival of their new Mistress, with a Pillion fixed behind, and a Case of Pi∣stols before him, attended only by a Favourite Hound. Thus equipped, he in a very obliging (but somewhat positive) Manner desired his La∣dy to seat her self on the Cushion; which done, away they crawled. The Road being obstruct∣ed by a Gate, the Dog was commanded to open it: The poor Cur looked up and wagged his Tail; but the Master, to shew the Impa∣tience of his Temper, drew a Pistol and shot him dead. He had no sooner done it, but he
<PB N="186" REF="196"/>
fell into a Thousand Apologies for his unhappy Rashness, and begged as many Pardons for his Excesses before one for whom he had so profound a Respect. Soon after their Steed stum∣bled, but with some Difficulty recovered: How∣ever, the Bridegroom took Occasion to swear, if he frighted his Wife so again, he would run him through: And alas! the poor Animal being now almost tired, made a second Trip; imme∣diately on which the careful Husband alights, and with great Ceremony first takes off his La∣dy, then the Accoutrements, draws his Sword, and saves the Huntsman the Trouble of killing him: Then says to his Wife, Child, prithee take up the Saddle; which she readily did, and tug∣ged it Home, where they found all Things in the greatest Order, suitable to their Fortune and the present Occasion. Some Time after the Fa∣ther of the Lady gave an Entertainment to all his Daughters and their Husbands, where, when the Wives were retired, and the Gentleman pas∣sing a Toast about, our last married Man took Occasion to observe to the rest of his Brethren, how much, to his great Satisfaction, he found the World mistaken as to the Temper of his Lady, for that she was the most meek and hum∣ble Woman breathing. The Applause was re∣ceived with a loud Laugh: But as a Tryal which of them would appear the most Master at Home, he proposed they should all by Turns send for their Wives down to them. A Servant was dis∣patched, and Answer was made by one, Tell him I will come by and by; another, That she would come when the Cards were out of her Hand; and so on. But no sooner was her Hus∣band's Desire whispered in the Ear of our last married Lady, but the Cards were clapped on the Table, and down she comes with, My Dear, would you speak with me? He receives her in his Arms, and after repeated Caresses tells her
<PB N="187" REF="197"/>
the Experiment, confesses his good Nature, and assures her That since she could now command her, Temper, he would no longer disguise his own.</P>
<P>I received the following Letter, with a Dozen of Wine, and cannot but do Justice to the Li∣quor, and give my Testimony; That I have tried it upon several of my Acquaintance, who were given to impertinent Abbreviations, with great Success.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should have waited on you very frequently to have discoursed you upon some Matters of Moment, but that I love to be well informed in the Subject upon which I consult my Friends be∣fore I enter into Debate with them. I have there∣fore with the utmost Care and Pains applied my self to the reading all the Writings and Pam∣phlets which have come out since the Trial, and have studied Night and Day in order to be Ma∣ster of the whole Controversy: But the Authors are so numerous, and the State of Affairs alters so very fast, that I am now a Fortnight behind∣hand in my Reading, and know only how Things stood Twelve Days ago. I wish you would enter into those useful Subjects; for, if I may be allowed to say so, these are not Times to jest in. As for my own Part, you know very well, that I am of a publick Spirit, and never regarded my own Interest, but looked further; and let me tell you, that while some People are minding only themselves and Families, and o∣thers are thinking only of their own Country, Thing go on strangely in the <HI>North.</HI> I foresee very great Evils arising from the Neglect of Transactions at a Distance; for which Reason I am now writing a Letter to a Friend in the Country, which I design as an Answer to the
<PB N="189" REF="199"/>
Czar of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Letter to the Grand Signior concerning his Majesty of <HI>Sweden.</HI> I have en∣deavoured to prove, that it is not reasonable to expect that his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty should leave <HI>Bender</HI> without Forty Thousand Men; and I have added to this, an Apology for the <HI>Cossacks.</HI> But the Matter multiplies upon me, and I grow dim with much Writing; therefore desire, if you have an old green Pair of Spectacles, such as you used about your Fiftieth Year, that you send them to me; as also, that you would please to desire Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI> to send me in a Bushel of Coals on the Credit of my Answer to his Cza∣rian Majesty; for I design it shall be printed for <HI>Morphew,</HI> and the Weather grows sharp. I shall take it kindly if you would order him also to send me the Papers as they come out. If there are no fresh Pamphlets published, I compute that I shall know before the End of next Month what has been done in Town to this Day. If it were not for an ill Custom lately introduced by a certain Author, of talking <HI>Latin</HI> at the Begin∣ning of Papers, Matters would be in a much clearer Light than they are: But to our Com∣fort, there are solid Writers who are not guilty of this Pedantry. The <HI>Post-Man</HI> writes like an Angel: The <HI>Moderator</HI> is fine Reading! It would do you no Harm to read the <HI>Post-Boy</HI> with Attention; he is very deep of late. He is In∣structive; but I confess a little Satyrical: A sharp Pen! He cares not what he says. The <HI>Exa∣miner</HI> is admirable, and is become a grave and substantial Author. But above all, I am at a Loss how to govern my self in my Judgment of those whose whole Writings consist in Interro∣gatories: And then the Way of answering, by proposing Questions as hard to them, is quite as extraordinary. As for my Part, I tremble at these Novelties; we expose, in my Opinion, our Af∣fairs too much by it. You may be sure the

<P>This unhappy Correspondent, whose fantastical Loyalty to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has reduced him to this low Condition of Reason and Fortune, would appear much more monstrous in his Mad∣ness, did we not see Crowds very little above his Circumstances from the same Cause, a Passion to Politicks.</P>
<P>It is no unpleasant Entertainment to consider the Commerce even of the Sexes interrupted by Difference in State Affairs. A Wench and her Gallant parted last Week upon the Words <HI>Unli∣mited</HI> and <HI>Passive:</HI> And there is such a Jargon of Terms got into the Mouths of the very silliest of the Women, that you cannot come into a Room even among them, but you find them divided in∣to <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory.</HI> What heightens the Humour is, that all the hard Words they know, they cer∣tainly suppose to be Terms useful in the Disputes of the Parties. I came in this Day where Two were in very hot Debate, and one of them pro∣posed to me to explain to them what was the Dif∣ference between Circumcision and Predestination. You may be sure I was at a Loss; but they were too angry at each other to wait for my Explana∣tion, but proceeded to lay open the whole State of Affairs, instead of the usual Topicks of Dress, Gallantry and Scandal.</P>
<P>I have often wondered how it should be possible that this Turn to Politicks should so universally prevail, to the Exclusion of every other Subject out
<PB N="191" REF="201"/>
of Conversation; and upon mature Consideration, find it is for Want of Discourse. Look round you among all the young Fellows you meet, and you see those who have least Relish for Books, Com∣pany, or Pleasure, though they have no Manner of Qualities to make them succeed in those Pur∣suits, shall make very passable Politicians. Thus the most barren Invention shall find enough to say to make one appear an able Man in the Top-Cof∣fee-houses. It is but adding a certain Vehemence in uttering your self, let the Thing you say be never so flat, and you shall be thought a very sensible Man, if you were not too hot. As Love and Honour are the noblest Motives of Life; so the Pretenders to them, without being animated by them, are the most contemptible of all Sorts of Pretenders. The unjust Affectation of any Thing that is laudable, is ignominious in Proportion to the Worth of the Thing we affect: Thus, as Love of one's Country is the most glorious of all Passions, to see the most ordinary Tools in a Na∣tion give themselves Airs that Way, without any one good Quality in their own Life, has something in it Romantick, yet not so ridiculous as odious.</P>

<P>WHEN the Mind has been perplexed with anxious Cares and Passions, the best Me∣thod of bringing it to its usual State of Tranqui∣lity, is, as much as we possibly can, to turn our Thoughts to the Adversities of Persons of higher Consideration in Virtue and Merit than our selves. By this Means all the little Incidents of our own Lives, if they are unfortunate, seem to be the Ef∣fect of Justice upon our Faults and Indiscretions. When those whom we know to be excellent and deserving of a better Fate are wretched, we cannot but resign our selves, whom most of us know to merit a much worse State than that we are placed in. For such and many other Occasions, there is one admirable Relation which one might re∣commend for certain Periods of one's Life, to touch, comfort, and improve the Heart of Man. <HI>Tully</HI> says, somewhere, The Pleasures of an Hus∣bandman are next to those of a Philosopher. In like Manner one may say, (for methinks they bear the same Proportion one to another) the Pleasures of Humanity are next to those of Devotion. In both these latter Satisfactions, there is a certain Humiliation which exalts the Soul above its ordi∣nary State. At the same Time that it lessens our Value of our selves, it enlarges our Estimation of others. The History I am going to speak of, is
<PB N="193" REF="203"/>
that of <HI>Joseph</HI> in Holy Writ, which is related with such Majestick Simplicity, that all the Parts of it strike us with strong Touches of Nature and Compassion, and he must be a Stranger to both who can read it with Attention, and not be over∣whelmed with the Vicissitudes of Joy and Sor∣row. I hope it will not be a Prophanation to tell it ones own Way here, that they who may be unthinking enough to be more frequently Readers of such Papers as this than of Sacred Writ, may be advertised, that the greatest Pleasures the Ima∣gination can be entertained with are to be found there, and that even the Style of the Scriptures is more than Humane.</P>
<P><HI>Joseph,</HI> a beloved Child of <HI>Israel,</HI> became invi∣dious to his elder Brethren, for no other Reason but his superior Beauty and Excellence of Body and Mind, insomuch that they could not bear his growing Virtue, and let him live. They there∣fore conspire his Death; but Nature pleaded so strongly for him in the Heart of one of them, that by his Perswasion they determined rather to bury him in a Pit, than be his immediate Execu∣tioners with their own Hands. When thus much was obtained for him, their Minds still softened towards him, and they took the Opportunity of some Passengers to sell him into <HI>Egypt. Israel</HI> was persuaded by the Artifice of his Sons, that the Youth was torn to Pieces by Wild Beasts: But <HI>Joseph</HI> was sold to Slavery, and still exposed to new Misfortunes, from the same Cause as before, his Beauty and his Virtue. By a false Accusation he was committed to Prison, but in Process of Time delivered from it, in Consideration of his Wis∣dom and Knowledge, and made the Governor of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s House. In this Elevation of his For∣tune, his Brothers were sent into <HI>Egypt</HI> to buy Ne∣cessaries of Life in a Famine. As soon as they are brought into his Presence, he beholds, but he beholds with Compassion, the Men who had sold
<PB N="194" REF="204"/>
him to Slavery approaching him with Awe and Reverence. While he was looking over his Bre∣thren, he takes a Resolution to indulge himself in the Pleasure of stirring their and his own Af∣fections, by keeping himself concealed, and exa∣mining into the Circumstances of their Family. For this End, with an Air of Severity, as a watch∣ful Minister to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> he accuses them as Spies, who are come into <HI>Egypt</HI> with Designs against the State. This led them into the Account which he wanted of them, the Condition of their ancient Father and little Brother, whom they had left be∣hind them. When he had learned that his Bro∣ther was living, he demands the bringing him to <HI>Egypt,</HI> as a Proof of their Veracity.</P>
<P>But it would be a vain and empty Endeavour to attempt laying this excellent Representation of the Passions of Man in the same Colours as they appear in the Sacred Writ in any other Manner, or almost any other Words, than those made use of in the Page it self. I am obliged therefore to turn my designed Narration rather into a Com∣ment upon the several Parts of that beautiful and passionate Scene. When <HI>Joseph</HI> expects to see <HI>Benjamin,</HI> How natural, and how forcible is the Reflection, <HI>This Affliction is come upon us in that we saw the Anguish of our Brother's Soul</HI> without Pity? How moving must it be to <HI>Joseph</HI> to hear <HI>Reuben</HI> accuse the rest, that they would not hear what he pleaded in Behalf of his Innocence and Distress? He turns from them and weeps, but commands his Passion so far as to give Orders for binding one of them in the Presence of the rest, while he at Leisure observed their different Sentiments and Concern in their Gesture and Countenance. When <HI>Benjamin</HI> is demanded in Bondage for stealing the Cup, With what Force, and what Resignation does <HI>Judah</HI> address his Brother?</P>
<P>In what Words shall I speak to my Lord; with what Confidence can I say any Thing? Our Guilt
<PB N="195" REF="205"/>
is but too apparent, we submit to our Fate. <HI>We are my Lord's Servants, both we and he also with whom the Cup is found.</HI> When that is not accep∣ted, How pathetically does he recapitulate the whole Story? And approaching nearer to <HI>Joseph,</HI> delivers himself as follows; which, if we fix our Thoughts upon the Relation between the Plea∣der and the Judge, it is impossible to read with∣out Tears.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Let me intrude so far upon you even in the high Condition in which you are, and the miserable One in which you see me and my Brethren, to in∣form you of the Circumstances of us unhappy Men that prostrate our selves before you. When we were first examined by you, you enquired, (for what Reason my Lord enquired we know not;) but you enquired whether we had not a Father or a Brother? We then acquainted you, that we had a Father, an old Man, who had a Child of his old Age, and had buried another Son whom he had by the same Woman. You were pleased to command us to bring the Child he had remaining down to you: We did so, and he has forfeited his Liberty. But my Father said to us, You know that my Wife bare me Two Sons, one of them was torn in Pieces: If Mischief befal this also, it will bring my Grey Hairs with Sor∣row to the Grave. Accept, therefore, Oh my Lord! me for your Bond-man, and let the Lad return with his Brethren, that I may not see the Evil that shall come on my Father. Here <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Passion grew too great for further Disguise, and he reveals himself with Exclamations of Transport and Tenderness.</P>
<P>After their Recovery from their first Astonish∣ment, his Brethren were seized with Fear for the Injuries they had done him; but how generously does he keep them in Countenance, and make an
<PB N="196" REF="206"/>
Apology for them: <HI>Be not angry with your selves for selling me hither;</HI> call it not so, but think Pro∣vidence sent me before you to preserve Life.</P>
<P>It would be endless to go through all the Beau∣ties of this sacred Narrative; but any who shall read it, at an Hour when he is disengaged from all other Regard or Interests than what arise from it, will feel the alternate Passion of a Father, a Brother, and a Son, so warm in him, that they will incline him to exert himself (in such of those Characters as happen to be his) much above the ordinary Course of his Life.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am an old Man, retired from all Acquain∣tance with the Town, but what I have from your Papers (not the worst Entertainment of
<PB N="197" REF="207"/>
my Solitude;) yet being still a Well-wisher to my Country and the Commonwealth of Learn∣ing <HI>(a qua, confitcor, nullam Aetatis meae Par∣tem abhorruisse;)</HI> and hoping the plain Phrase in Writing that was current in my younger Days would have lasted for my Time, I was startled at the Picture of modern Politeness (transmit∣ted by your ingenious Correspondent), and grie∣ved to see our Sterling <HI>English</HI> Language fallen into the Hands of <HI>Clippers</HI> and <HI>Coyners.</HI> That mutilated Epistle, consisting of <HI>Hippo, Rep's,</HI> and such-like enormous Curtailings, was a mortify∣ing Spectacle, but with the Reserve of Comfort to find this, and other Abuses of our Mother-Tongue, so pathetically complained of, and to the proper Person for redressing them, the Cen∣sor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>He had before represented, <HI>the deplorable Ig∣norance that for several Years past has reigned amongst our</HI> English <HI>Writers, the great Depravity of our Taste, and continual Corruption of our Style:</HI> But, Sir, before you give your self the Trouble of prescribing Remedies for these Distempers, (which you own will require the greatest Care and Application) give me Leave (having long had my Eye upon these Mischiefs, and Thoughts exercised about them) to mention what I hum∣bly conceive to be the Cause of them, and in your Friend <HI>Horace's</HI> Words, <HI>Quo Fonte derivata Clades in Patriam Populumque fluxit.</HI></P>
<P>I take our corrupt Ways of Writing to pro∣ceed from the Mistakes and wrong Measures in our common Methods of <HI>Education,</HI> which I al∣ways looked upon as one of our National Grie∣vances, and a Singularity that renders us no less than our Situation,
<Q><L>— Penitus toto divisos Orbe Britannos.</L></Q>
This puts me upon consulting the most celebra∣ted Criticks on that Subject, to compare our Pra∣ctice
<PB N="198" REF="208"/>
with their Precepts, and find where it was that we came short or went wide.</P>
<P>But after all, I found our Case required some∣thing more than these Doctors had directed, and the principal Defect of our <HI>English</HI> Discipline to lie in the <HI>Initiatory</HI> Part, which, altho' it needs the greatest Care and Skill, is usually left to the Conduct of those blind Guides, <HI>viz.</HI> Chance and Ignorance.</P>
<P>I shall trouble you with but a single Instance, pursuant to what your sagacious Friend has said, That he <HI>could furnish you with a Catalogue of</HI> English <HI>Books, that would cost you a Hundred Pounds at first Hand, wherein you could not find Ten Lines together of common</HI> Grammar; which is a necessary Consequence of our Mismanagement in that Province.</P>
<P>For can any Thing be more absurd than our Way of Proceeding in this Part of Literature? To push tender Wits into the intricate Mazes of Grammar, and a <HI>Latin</HI> Grammer? To learn an unknown Art by an unknown Tongue? To carry them a dark Round-about Way to let them in at a Back-Door? Whereas by teaching them first the Grammar of their Mother-Tongue, (so easy to be learned) their Advance to the Grammars of <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> would be gradual and easy; but our precipitate Way of hurrying them over such a <HI>Gulph,</HI> before we have built them a <HI>Bridge</HI> to it, is a Shock to their weak Understandings, which they seldom, or very late, recover. In the mean Time we wrong Nature, and slander Infants, who want neither Capacity nor Will to learn, till we put them up∣on Service beyond their Strength, and then in∣deed we baulk them.</P>
<P>The Liberal Arts and Sciences are all beauti∣ful as the <HI>Graces;</HI> nor has <HI>Grammar</HI> (the se∣vere Mother of all) so frightful a Face of her <HI>Own;</HI> 'tis the <HI>Vizard</HI> put upon it that scares
<PB N="199" REF="209"/>
Children. She is made to speak hard Words, that to them sound like Conjuring. Let her talk intelligibly, and they will listen to her.</P>
<P>In this, I think, as on other Accounts, we shew our selves true <HI>Britains,</HI> always overlook∣ing our natural Advantages. It has been the Practice of wisest Nations to learn their own Language by stated Rules, to avoid the Confu∣sion that would follow from leaving it to vul∣gar Use. Our <HI>English</HI> Tongue (says a learned Man) is the most determinate in its Constru∣ction, and reducible to the fewest Rules What∣ever Language has less Grammar in it, is not in∣telligible; and whatever has more, all that it has more is superfluous; for which Reasons he would have it made the Foundation of learning <HI>Latin,</HI> and all other Languages.</P>
<P>To speak and write without Absurdity the Language of one's Country, is commendable in Persons of all Stations, and to some indispensi∣bly necessary; and to this Purpose, I would re∣commend above all Things the having a <HI>Gram∣mar</HI> of our Mother-Tongue first taught in our Schools, which would facilitate our Youths learning their <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek Grammars,</HI> with spare Time for Arithmetick, Astronomy, Cos∣mography, History, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that would make them pass the Spring of their Life with Profit and Pleasure, that is now miserably spent in Gram∣matical Perplexities.</P>
<P>But here, methinks, I see the Reader smile, and ready to ask me, (as the Lawyer did Sexton <HI>Diego</HI> on his bequeathing rich Legacies to the Poor of the Parish. Where are these mighty Sums to be raised?) Where is there such a <HI>Grammar</HI> to be had? I will not answer, as he did, Even where your Worship pleases. No, it is our good Fortune to have such a <HI>Grammar,</HI> with Notes, now in the Press, and to be published next Term.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="210"/>

<P>AMong those Inclinations which are common to all Men, there is none more unaccounta∣ble than that unequal Love by which Parents di∣stinguish their Children from each other. Some∣times Vanity and Self-love appear to have a Share towards this Effect; and in other Instances I have been apt to attribute it to meer Instinct: But however that is, we frequently see the Child that has been beholden to neither of these Im∣pulses in their Parents, in spight of being neg∣lected, snubbed, and thwarted at Home, acquire a Behaviour which makes it as agreeable to all the rest of the World, as that of every one else of
<PB N="202" REF="212"/>
their Family is to each other. I fell into this Way of Thinking from an Intimacy which I have with a very good House in our Neighbourhood, where there are Three Daughters of a very different Character and Genius. The eldest has a great deal of Wit and Cunning; the Second has good Sense, but no Artifice; the Third has much Vi∣vacity, but little Understanding. The First is a fine, but scornful Woman; the Second is not charming, but very winning; the Third no Way commendable, but very desirable. The Father of these young Creatures was ever a great Pretender to Wit, the Mother a Woman of as much Coquet∣try. This Turn in the Parents has biassed their Affections towards their Children. The old Man supposes the eldest of his own Genius, and the Mother looks upon the youngest as her self re∣newed. By this Means, all the Lovers that ap∣proach the House are discarded by the Father for not observing Mrs. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Wit and Beauty, and by the Mother for being blind to the Mien and Air of Mrs. <HI>Biddy.</HI> Come never so many Preten∣ders, they are not suspected to have the least Thoughts of Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> the middle Daughter. <HI>Betty</HI> therefore is mortified into a Woman of a great deal of Merit, and knows she must depend on that only for her Advancement. The middle∣most is thus the Favourite of all her Acquaintance as well as mine, while the other Two carry a certain Insolence about them in all Conversations, and expect the Partiality which they meet with at Home to attend them wherever they appear. So little do Parents understand that they are of all People the least Judges of their Children's Merit, that what they reckon such is seldom any Thing else but a Repetition of their own Faults and Infirmities.</P>
<P>There is, methinks, some Excuse for being par∣ticular, when one of the Offspring has any Defect in Nature. In this Case, the Child, if we may so
<PB N="203" REF="213"/>
speak, is so much the longer the Child of its Pa∣rents, and calls for the Continuance of their Care and Indulgence from the Slowness of its Capaci∣ty, or the Weakness of its Body. But there is no enduring to see Men enamoured only at the Sight of their own Impertinencies repeated, and to ob∣serve, as we may sometimes, that they have a se∣cret Dislike of their Children for a Degeneracy from their very Crimes. Commend me to Lady <HI>Goodly;</HI> she is equal to all her own Children, but prefers them to those of all the World beside. My Lady is a perfect Hen in the Care of her Brood; she fights and squabbles with all that ap∣pear where they come, but is wholly unbiassed in dispensing her Favours among them. It is no small Pains she is at to defame all the young Wo∣men in her Neighbourhood by Visits, Whispers, Intimations, and Hearsays; all which she ends with thanking Heaven, that no one living is so blessed with such obedient and well inclined Chil∣dren as her self. Perhaps, says she, <HI>Betty</HI> cannot dance like Mrs. <HI>Frontinett,</HI> and it is no great Mat∣ter whether she does or not; but she comes into a Room with a good Grace; though she says it that should not, she looks like a Gentlewoman. Then if Mrs. <HI>Rebecca</HI> is not so talkative as the mighty Wit Mrs. <HI>Clapper,</HI> yet she is discreet, she knows better what she says when she does speak. If her Wit be slow, her Tongue never runs before it. This kind Parent lifts up her Eyes and Hands in Congratulation of her own good Fortune, and is maliciously thankful that none of her Girls are like any of her Neighbours: But this Preference of her own to all others, is grounded upon an Impulse of Nature; while those who like one be∣fore another of their own, are so unpardonably unjust, that it could hardly be equalled in the Children, though they preferred all the rest of the World to such Parents. It is no unpleasant Entertainment to see a Ball at a Dancing-School,
<PB N="204" REF="214"/>
and observe the Joy of Relations when the young Ones, for whom they are concerned, are in Mo∣tion. You need not be told whom the Dancers belong to. At their first Appearance the Passion of their Parents are in their Faces, and there is al∣ways a Nod of Approbation stolen at a good Step, or a graceful Turn.</P>
<P>I remember among all my Acquaintance but one Man whom I have thought to live with his Children with Equanimity and a good Grace. He had Three Sons and One Daughter, whom he bred with all the Care imaginable in a liberal and ingenuous Way. I have often heard him say, He had the Weakness to love one much better than the other, but that he took as much Pains to cor∣rect that as any other Criminal Passion that could arise in his Mind. His Method was, to make it the only Pretension in his Children to his Favour to be kind to each other; and he would tell them, That he who was the best Brother, he would reckon the best Son. This turned their Thoughts into an Emulation for the Superiority in kind and tender Affection towards each other. The Boys behaved themselves very early with a Manly Friendship; and their Sister, instead of the gross Familiarities and impertinent Freedoms in Behaviour, usual in other Houses, was always treated by them with as much Complaisance as any other young Lady of their Acquaintance. It was an unspeakable Pleasure to visit or sit at Meal in that Family. I have often seen the old Man's Heart flow at his Eyes with Joy upon Occasions which would appear indifferent to such as were Strangers to the Turn of his Mind; but a very slight Accident, wherein he saw his Children's Good-Will to one another, created in him the God-like Pleasure of loving them, because they loved each other. This great Command of him∣self, in hiding his first Impulse to Partiality, at last improved to a steady Justice towards them;
<PB N="205" REF="215"/>
and that which at first was but an Expedient to correct his Weakness, was afterwards the Mea∣sure of his Virtue.</P>
<P>The Truth of it is, those Parents who are in∣terested in the Care of one Child more than that of another, no longer deserve the Name of Pa∣rents, but are in Effect as childish as their Chil∣dren, in having such unreasonable and ungovern∣ed Inclinations. A Father of this Sort has degra∣ded himself into one of his own Offspring; for none but a Child would take Part in the Passions of Children.</P>

<P>I Find in the Registers of my Family, that the Branch of the <HI>Bickerstaffs,</HI> from which I am de∣scended, came originally out of <HI>Ireland.</HI> This has given me a Kind of natural Affection for that Country.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin.</DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FInding by several Passages of your <HI>Tatlers,</HI> that you are a Person curious in Natural Knowledge, I thought it would not be unac∣ceptable to you to give you the following Histo∣ry of the Migration of Frogs into this Country. There is an ancient Tradition among the wild Philosophers of the Kingdom, That this whole Island was once as much infested by Frogs, as that wherein <HI>Whittington</HI> made his Fortune was by Mice. Insomuch that it is said, <HI>Mackdonald</HI> the First could no more sleep by reason of these <HI>Dutch</HI> Nightingales, (as they are called at <HI>Paris</HI>) than <HI>Pharaoh</HI> could when they croaked in his Bed-Chamber. It was in the Reign of this great Monarch that St. <HI>Patrick</HI> arrived in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> being as famous for destroying Vermin as any Rat-catcher of our Times. If we may be∣lieve the Tradition, he killed more in one Day than a Flock of Storks could have done in a Twelvemonth. From that Time for about Five hundred Years, there was not a Frog to be heard in <HI>Ireland,</HI> notwithstanding the Bogs still remained, which in former Ages had been so plentifully stocked with those Inhabitants.</P>
<P>When the Arts began to flourish in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and that great Mo∣narch had placed himself at the Head of the Royal Society, to lead them forward into the Discoveries of Nature, it is said, That several Proposals were laid before his Majesty for the importing of Frogs into <HI>Ireland.</HI> In order to it, a Virtuoso of known Abilities was unanimously elected by the Society, and intrusted with the whole Management of that Affair. For this End he took along with him a sound Able-bo∣died Frog, of a strong hale Constitution, that
<PB N="207" REF="217"/>
had given Proofs of his Vigour by several Leaps which he made before that Learned Body. They took Ship, and sailed together till they came within Sight of the Hill of <HI>Hoath,</HI> before the Frog discovered any Symptoms of being in∣disposed by his Voyage: But as the Wind chop∣ped about, and began to blow from the <HI>Irish</HI> Coast, he grew Sea-sick, or rather Land-sick; for his learned Companion ascribed it to the Particles of the Soil with which the Wind was impregnated. He was confirmed in his Con∣jecture, when, upon the Wind's turning about, his Fellow Traveller sensibly recovered, and continued in good Health till his Arrival upon the Shore, where he suddenly relapsed, and ex∣pired upon a <HI>Ring</HI>'s-<HI>End</HI> Car in his Way to <HI>Dub∣lin.</HI> The same Experiment was repeated seve∣ral Times in that Reign, but to no Purpose. A Frog was never known to take Three Leaps upon <HI>Irish</HI> Turf, before he stretched himself out and died.</P>
<P>Whether it were that the Philos;ophers on this Side the Water despaired of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ocking the Island with this useful Animal, or whether in the following Reign it was not thought proper to undo the Miracle of a Popish Saint, I do not hear of any further Progress made in this Af∣fair till about Two Years after the Battle of the <HI>Boyne.</HI></P>
<P>It was then that an ingenious Physician, to the Honour as well as Improvement of his Native Country, performed what the <HI>English</HI> had been so long attempting in vain. This learned Man, with the Hazard of his Life, made a Voyage to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> where he filled several Barrels with the choicest Spawn of Frogs that could be found in those Parts. This Cargo he brought over very carefully, and afterwards disposed of it in several warm Beds that he thought most capable of bringing it to Life. The Doctor was
<PB N="208" REF="218"/>
a very ingenious Physician, and a very good Protestant; for which Reason, to show his Zeal against Popery, he placed some of the most promising Spawn in the very Fountain that is dedicated to the Saint, and known by the Name of St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s <HI>Well,</HI> where these Animals had the Impudence to make their first Appearance. They have since that Time very much increased and multiplied in all the Neighbourhood of this City. We have here some curious Enquirers into Natural History who observe their Motions, with a Design to compute in how many Years they will be able to hop from <HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Wex∣ford;</HI> tho', as I am inform'd, not one of them has yet passed the Mountains of <HI>Wicklow.</HI></P>
<P>I am further informed, that several Grasiers of the County of <HI>Cork</HI> have entered into a Pro∣ject of planting a Colony in those Parts, at the Instance of the <HI>French</HI> Protestants: And I know not but the same Design may be on Foot in other Parts of the Kingdom, if the Wisdom of the <HI>British</HI> Nation do not think fit to prohibit the further Importation of <HI>English</HI> Frogs. I am,</P>

<P>There is no Study more becoming a rational Creature, than that of Natural Philosophy; but as several of our modern Virtuoso's manage it, their Speculations do not so much tend to open and enlarge the Mind, as to contract and fix it upon Trifles.</P>
<P>This in <HI>England</HI> is in a great Measure owing to the worthy Elections that are so frequently made in our Royal Society. They seem to be in a Con∣federacy against Men of polite Genius, noble Thought, and diffusive Learning; and chuse into their Assemblies such as have no Pretence to Wis∣dom, but Want of Wit; or to natural Know∣ledge,
<PB N="209" REF="219"/>
but Ignorance of every Thing else. I have made Observations in this Matter so long, that when I meet with a young Fellow that is an humble Admirer of the Sciences, but more dull than the rest of the Company, I conclude him to be a Fellow of the Royal Society.</P>

<P>COming Home last Night before my usual Hour, I took a Book into my Hand, in or∣der to divert my self with it till Bed-time. <HI>Mil∣ton</HI> chanced to be my Author, whose admirable Poem of <HI>Paradise Lost</HI> serves, at once, to fill the Mind with pleasing Idea's, and with good Thoughts, and was therefore the most proper Book for my Purpose. I was amusing my self with that beautiful Passage in which the Poet re∣presents <HI>Eve</HI> sleeping by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Side, with the Devil sitting at her Ear, and inspiring evil Thoughts under the Shape of a Toad. <HI>Ithuriel,</HI> one of the Guardian Angels of the Place, walking his Nightly Rounds, saw the great Enemy of Mankind hid in this loathsome Animal, which he touched with his Spear. This Spear being of a Celestial Temper, had such a secret Virtue in it, that whatever it was applied to, immediately flung off all Disguise, and appeared in its natu∣ral Figure. I am afraid the Reader will not par∣don me if I content my self with explaining the
<PB N="210" REF="220"/>
Passage in Prose, without giving it in the Author's own inimitable Words:</P>
<Q><L>— On he led his radiant Files,</L>
<L>Dazzling the Morn: These to the Bower direct,</L>
<L>In Search of whom they sought. Him there they found,</L>
<L>Squat like a Toad, close at the Ear of <HI>Eve;</HI></L>
<L>Essaying by his devilish Art to reach</L>
<L>The Organs of her Fancy, and with them forge</L>
<L>Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams;</L>
<L>Or if, inspiring Venom, he might taint</L>
<L>The Animal Spirits (that from pure Blood arise</L>
<L>Like gentle Breaths from Rivers pure) thence raise</L>
<L>At least distemper'd, discontented Thoughts,</L>
<L>Vain Hopes, vain Aims, inordinate Destres,</L>
<L>Blown up with high Conceits, ingendring Pride.</L>
<L>Him thus intent, <HI>Ithuriel</HI> with his Spear</L>
<L>Touch'd lightly; for no Falshood can endure</L>
<L>Touch of Celestial Temper, but returns</L>
<L>Of Force to his own Likeness. Up he starts,</L>
<L>Discover'd and surpriz'd. As when a Spark</L>
<L>Lights on a Heap of nitrous Powder, laid</L>
<L>Fit for the Tun, some Magazine to store</L>
<L>Against a rumour'd War, the smutty Grain,</L>
<L>With sudden Blaze diffus'd, inflames the Air;</L>
<L>So started up in his own Shape the Fiend.</L></Q>
<P>I could not forbear thinking how happy a Man would be in the Possession of this Spear; or what an Advantage it would be to a Minister of State, were he Master of such a White Staff. It would let him discover his Friends from his Enemies, Men of Abilities from Pretenders: It would hin∣der him from being imposed upon by Appea∣rances and Professions, and might be made use of as a Kind of State Test, which no Artifice could elude.</P>
<P>These Thoughts made very lively Impressions on my Imagination, which were improv'd, in∣stead of being defaced by Sleep, and produced in me the following Dream: I was no sooner fallen
<PB N="211" REF="221"/>
asleep, but, methoughts, the Angel <HI>Ithuriel</HI> ap∣peared to me, and with a Smile that still added to his Celestial Beauty, made me a Present of the Spear which he held in his Hand, and disappear∣ed. To make Trial of it, I went into a Place of publick Resort.</P>
<P>The first Person that passed by me, was a Lady that had a particular Shyness in the Cast of her Eye, and a more than ordinary Reservedness in all the Parts of her Behaviour. She seemed to look upon Man as an obscene Creature, with a certain Scorn and Fear of him. In the Height of her Airs I touched her gently with my Wand, when, to my unspeakable Surprize, she fell upon her Back, and kick'd up her Heels in such a Man∣ner, as made me blush in my Sleep. As I was hasting away from this undisguised Prude, I saw a Lady in earnest Discourse with another, and overheard her say with some Vehemence, Never tell me of him, for I am resolv'd to die a Vir∣gin! I had a Curiosity to try her; but as soon as I laid my Wand upon her Head, she immediately fell in Labour. My Eyes were diverted from her by a Man and his Wife, who walked near me Hand in Hand after a very loving Manner. I gave each of them a gentle Tap, and the next Instant saw the Woman in Breeches, and the Man with a Fan in his Hand. It would be tedious to describe the long Series of Metamorphoses that I entertained my self with in my Night's Adven∣ture, of Whigs disguised in Tories, and Tories in Whigs; Men in Red Coats that denounced Ter∣ror in their Countenances, trembling at the Touch of my Spear; others in Black with Peace in their Mouths, but Swords in their Hands. I could tell Stories of Noblemen changed into Usurers, and Magistrates into Beadles; of Free-Thinkers into Penitents, and Reformers into Whoremasters. I must not however omit the Mention of a grave Citizen that passed by me with an huge Clasped
<PB N="212" REF="222"/>
Bible under his Arm, and a Band of a most im∣moderate Breadth; but upon a Touch on the Shoulder, he let drop his Book, and fell a picking my Pocket.</P>
<P>In the general I observed, that those who ap∣peared good, often disappointed my Expectation; but that on the contrary, those who appeared ve∣ry bad, still grew worse upon the Experiment; as the Toad in <HI>Milton,</HI> which one would have thought the most deformed Part of the Creation, at <HI>Ithuriel</HI>'s Stroke, became more deformed, and started up into a Devil.</P>
<P>Among all the Persons that I touched, there was but one who stood the Test of my Wand; and after many Repetitions of the Stroke, stuck to his Form, and remained steady and fixed in his first Appearance. This was a young Man who boasted of foul Distempers, wild Debauches, In∣sults upon holy Men, and Affronts to Religion.</P>
<P>My Heart was extremely troubled at this Vi∣sion: The Contemplation of the whole Species, so entirely sunk in Corruption, filled my Mind with a Melancholy that is inexpressible, and my Discoveries still added to my Affliction.</P>
<P>In the Midst of these Sorrows which I had in my Heart, methoughts there passed by me a Cou∣ple of Coaches with Purple Liveries. There sate in each of them a Person with a very venerable Aspect. At the Appearance of them, the People who were gathered round me in great Multi∣tudes divided into Parties, as they were disposed to favour either of those reverend Persons: The Enemies of one of them begged me to touch him with my Wand, and assured me, I should see his Lawn converted into a Cloak. The opposite Par∣ty told me with as much Assurance, That if I laid my Wand upon the other, I should see his Garments embroidered with Flower-de-Luces, and his Head covered with a Cardinal's Cap. I made the Experiment, and to my great Joy, saw
<PB N="213" REF="223"/>
them both, without any Change, distributing their Blessings to the People, and praying for those who had reviled them. Is it possible, thought I, that good Men, who are so few in Number, should be divided among themselves, and give better Quarter to the Vicious that are in their Party, than the most strictly Virtuous who are out of it? Are the Ties of Faction above those of Religion?—I was going on in my Soli∣loquies, but some sudden Accident awakened me, when I found my Hand grasped, but my Spear gone. The Reflection on so very odd a Dream made me figure to my self, What a strange Face the World would bear, should all Mankind appear in their proper Shapes and Characters, without Hypocrisy and Disguise? I am afraid, the Earth we live upon would appear to other in∣tellectual Beings no better than a Planet peopled with Monsters. This should, methinks, inspire us with an honest Ambition of recommending our selves to those invisible Spies, and of being what we would appear. There was one Circum∣stance in my foregoing Dream which I at first intended to conceal; but upon second Thoughts, I cannot look upon my self as a candid and im∣partial Historian, if I do not acquaint my Reader, that upon taking <HI>Ithuriel</HI>'s Spear into my Hand, though I was before an old decrepid Fellow, I appeared a very handsome, jolly, black Man. But I know my Enemies will say, this is praising my own Beauty, for which Reason I will speak no more of it.</P>

<P>STorms at Sea are so frequently described by the ancient Poets, and copied by the Moderns, that whenever I find the Winds begin to rise in a new Heroick Poem, I generally skip a Leaf or Two till I come into Fair Weather. <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Tempest</HI> is a Master-piece in this Kind, and is in∣deed so naturally drawn, that one who has made a Voyage can scarce read it without being Sea∣sick.</P>
<P>Land Showers are no less frequent among the Poets than the former, but I remember none of them which have not fallen in the Country; for which Reason they are generally filled with the Lowings of Oxen, and the Bleatings of Sheep, and very often embellished with a Rainbow.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Land Shower</HI> is likewise the best in its Kind: It is indeed a Shower of Consequence, and contributes to the main Design of the Poem, by cutting off a tedious Ceremonial, and bringing Matters to a speedy Conclusion between Two Po∣tentates of different Sexes. My ingenious Kins∣man Mr. <HI>Humphry Wagstaff,</HI> who treats of every Subject after a Manner that no other Author has done, and better than any other can do, has sent me the Description of a City Shower. I do not question but the Reader remembers my Cousin's Description of the Morning as it breaks in Town,
<PB N="215" REF="225"/>
which is printed in the 9th <HI>Tatler,</HI> and is another exquisite Piece of this Local Poetry:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Careful Observers may foretel the Hour</L>
<L>(By sure Prognosticks) when to dread a Show'r:</L>
<L>While Rain depends, the pensive Cat gives o'er</L>
<L>Her Frolicks, and pursues her Tail no more.</L>
<L>Returning Home at Night, you'll find the Sink</L>
<L>Strike your offended Sense with double Stink.</L>
<L>If you be wise, then go not far to dine,</L>
<L>You'll spend in Coach-hire more than save in Wine.</L>
<L>A coming Show'r your shooting Corns presage,</L>
<L>Old Aches throb, your hollow Tooth will rage.</L>
<L>Sauntring in Coffee-house is <HI>Dulman</HI> seen;</L>
<L>He damns the Climate, and complains of Spleen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean while the South rising with dabbled Wings,</L>
<L>A Sable Cloud athwart the Welkin flings,</L>
<L>That swill'd more Liquor than it could contain,</L>
<L>And like a Drunkard gives it up again.</L>
<L>Brisk <HI>Susan</HI> whips her Linen from the Rope,</L>
<L>While the first drizzling Show'r is born aslope.</L>
<L>Such is that Sprinkling which some careless Quean</L>
<L>Flirts on you from her Mop, but not so clean.</L>
<L>You fly, invoke the Gods; then turning, stop</L>
<L>To rail; she singing, still whirls on her Mop.</L>
<L>Not yet, the Dust had shun'd th'unequal Strife,</L>
<L>But aided by the Wind, fought still for Life;</L>
<L>And wafted with its Foe by violent Gust,</L>
<L>'Twas doubtful which was Rain, and which was Dust.</L>
<L>Ah! where must needy Poet seek for Aid,</L>
<L>When Dust and Rain at once his Coat invade;</L>

<P>IT is ridiculous for any Man to criticise on the Works of another, who has not distinguished himself by his own Performances. A Judge would make but an indifferent Figure who had never been known at the Bar. <HI>Cicero</HI> was reputed the greatest Orator of his Age and Country before he wrote a Book <HI>De Oratore;</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> the great∣est Poet before he published his <HI>Art of Poetry.</HI> This Observation arises naturally in any one who casts his Eye upon this last mentioned Author, where he will find the Criticisms placed in the latter End of his Book, that is, after the finest Odes and Satyrs in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>A Modern, whose Name I shall not mention, because I would not make a silly Paper sell, was born a Critick and an Examiner, and, like one of the Race of the Serpent's Teeth, came into the World with a Sword in his Hand. His Works put me in mind of the Story that is told of a <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Monk, who was taking a Catalogue of a Friend's Library, and meeting with a <HI>Hebrew</HI> Book in it, entered it under the Title of, <HI>A Book that has the Beginning where the End should be.</HI> This Author, in the last of his Crudities, has amas∣sed together a Heap of Quotations, to prove that <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> were both of them modester Men than my self, and if his Works were to live as long as mine, they might possibly give Poste∣rity a Notion, that <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> was a very
<PB N="218" REF="228"/>
conceited old Fellow, and as vain a Man as either <HI>Tully</HI> or Sir <HI>Francis Bacon.</HI> Had this serious Wri∣ter fallen upon me only, I could have overlook∣ed it; but to see <HI>Cicero</HI> abused, is, I must confess, what I cannot bear. The Censure he passes upon this great Man runs thus; <HI>The Itch of being very Abusive, is almost inseparable from Vain-Glory.</HI> Tully <HI>has these Two Faults in so high a Degree, that nothing but his being the best Writer in the World can make Amends for them.</HI> The scurrilous Wretch goes on to say I am as bad as <HI>Tully.</HI> His Words are these; <HI>And yet the</HI> Tatler, <HI>in his Paper of</HI> Sep∣tember 26, <HI>has out-done him in both. He speaks of himself with more Arrogance, and with more Inso∣lence of others.</HI> I am afraid by his Discourse, this Gentleman has no more read <HI>Plutarch</HI> than he has <HI>Tully.</HI> If he had, he would have observed a Pas∣sage in that Historian, wherein he has with great Delicacy distinguish'd between Two Passions which are usually complicated in Humane Nature, and which an ordinary Writer would not have thought of separating. Not having my <HI>Greek</HI> Spectacles by me, I shall quote the Passage Word for Word as I find it translated to my Hand. <HI>Nevertheless, tho' he was intemperately fond of his own Praise, yet he was very free from envying others, and most li∣berally profuse in commending both the Ancients and his Contemporaries, as is to be understood by his Wri∣tings; and many of those Sayings are still recorded, as that concerning</HI> Aristotle, <HI>That he was a River of flowing Gold: Of</HI> Plato<HI>'s Dialogue, That if</HI> Jupi∣ter <HI>were to speak, he would discourse as he did.</HI> Theophrastus <HI>he was wont to call his peculiar De∣light; and being asked, Which of</HI> Demosthenes <HI>his Orations he liked best? He answered, The longest.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as for the Eminent Men of his own Time, ei∣ther for Eloquence or Philosophy, there was not one of them which he did not, by writing or speaking fa∣vourably of, render more illustrious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="229"/>
Thus the Critick tells us, That <HI>Cicero</HI> was ex∣cessively vain-glorious and abusive; <HI>Plutarch,</HI> that he was vain, but not abusive. Let the Reader be∣lieve which of them he pleases.</P>
<P>After this he complains to the World, that I call him Names; and that in my Passion I said, He was <HI>a Flea, a Louse, an Owl, a Bat, a small Wit, a Scribbler, and a Nibbler.</HI> When he has thus be∣spoken his Reader's Pity, he falls into that admi∣rable Vein of Mirth, which I shall set down at length, it being an exquisite Piece of Raillery, and written in great Gaiety of Heart. <HI>After this List of Names,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> Flea, Louse, Owl, Bat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) <HI>I was surprised to hear him say, that he has hitherto kept his Temper pretty well; I wonder how he will write when he has lost his Temper? I suppose, as he now is very angry and unmannerly, he will then be ex∣ceeding courteous and good-humoured.</HI> If I can out-live this Raillery, I shall be able to bear any Thing.</P>
<P>There is a Method of Criticism made Use of by this Author, (for I shall take Care how I call him a Scribbler again) which may turn into Ridicule any Work that was ever written, wherein there is a Variety of Thoughts: This the Reader will observe in the following Words; <HI>He</HI> (meaning me) <HI>is so intent upon being something extraordina∣ry, that he scarce knows what he would be; and is as fruitful in his Similes, as a Brother of his whom I lately took Notice of. In the Compass of a few Lines he compares himself to a Fox, to</HI> Daniel Burgess, <HI>to the Knight of the Red Cross, to an Oak with Ivy about it, and to a great Man with an Equipage.</HI> I think my self as much honoured by being joined in this Part of his Paper with the Gentleman whom he here calls my Brother, as I am in the Beginning of it, by being mentioned with <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>It is very hard that a Man cannot publish Ten Papers without stealing from himself; but to show you that this is only a Knack of Writing, and that
<PB N="220" REF="230"/>
the Author is got into a certain Road of Criticism, I shall set down his Remarks on the Works of the Gentleman whom he here glances upon, as they stand in his 6th Paper, and desire the Reader to compare them with the foregoing Passage upon mine.</P>
<P><HI>In Thirty Lines his Patron is a River, the</HI> Primum Mobile, <HI>a Pilot, a Victim, the Sun, any Thing, and Nothing. He bestows Increase, conceals his Source, makes the Machine move, teaches to steer, expiates our Offences, raises Vapours, and looks larger as he sets.</HI></P>
<P>What Poem can be safe from this Sort of Criti∣cism? I think I was never in my Life so much offended as at a Wag whom I once met with in a Coffee-house: He had in his Hand one of the Miscellanies, and was reading the following short Copy of Verses, which, without Flattery to the Author, is (I think) as beautiful in its Kind as any one in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Flavia</HI> the least and flight est Toy</L>
<L>Can with resistless Art employ.</L>
<L>This Fan in meaner Hands would prove</L>
<L>An Engine of small Force in Love;</L>
<L>But she with such an Air and Mien,</L>
<L>Not to be told, or safely seen,</L>
<L>Directs its wanton Motions so,</L>
<L>That it wounds more than <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Bow;</L>
<L>Gives Coolness to the matchless Dame,</L>
<L>To ev'ry other Breast a Flame.</L></Q>
<P>When this Coxcomb had done reading them, Heyday! says he, What Instrument is this that <HI>Flavia</HI> employs in such a Manner as is not to be told, nor safely seen? In Ten Lines it is a Toy, a <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Bow, a Fan, and an Engine in Love. It has wanton Motions, it wounds, it cools, and in∣flames.</P>
<P>Such Criticisms make a Man of Sense sick, and a Fool merry.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="231"/>
The next Paragraph of the Paper we are talk∣ing of, falls upon some Body whom I am at a Loss to guess at: But I find the whole Invective turns upon a Man who (it seems) has been impri∣soned for Debt. Whoever he was, I must hear∣tily pity him; but at the same Time must put the Examiner in Mind, that notwithstanding he is a Critick, he still ought to remember he is a Chri∣stian. Poverty was never thought a proper Sub∣ject for Ridicule; and I do not remember that I ever met with a Satyr upon a Beggar.</P>
<P>As for those little Retortings of my own Ex∣pressions, of <HI>being dull by Design, witty in</HI> October, <HI>shining, excelling,</HI> and so forth; they are the com∣mon Cavils of every Witlin, who has no other Method of showing his Parts, but by little Varia∣tions and Repetitions of the Man's Words whom he attacks.</P>
<P>But the Truth of it is, the Paper before me, not only in this Particular, but in its very Essence, is like <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Eccho:</P>
<Q><L>— Quae nec reticere loquenti,</L>
<L>Nec prior ipsa loqui didicit. —</L></Q>
<P>I should not have deserved the Character of a Censor, had I not animadverted upon the above∣mentioned Author by a gentle Chastisement: But I know my Reader will not pardon me, unless I declare, that nothing of this Nature for the future (unless it be written with some Wit) shall divert me from my Care of the Publick.</P>

<P>I DO not remember that in any of my Lucu∣brations I have touched upon that useful Sci∣ence of Physick, notwithstanding I have declared my self more than once a Professor of it. I have indeed joined the Study of Astrology with it, be∣cause I never knew a Physician recommend him∣self to the Publick who had not a Sister Art to embellish his Knowledge in Medicine. It has been commonly observed in Compliment to the Inge∣nious of our Profession, that <HI>Apollo</HI> was God of Verse as well as Physick; and in all Ages the most celebrated Practitioners of our Country were the particular Favourites of the Muses. Poetry to Physick is indeed like the Gilding to a Pill; it makes the Art shine, and covers the Severity of the Doctor with the Agreeableness of the Com∣panion.</P>
<P>The very Foundation of Poety is good Sense, if we may allow <HI>Harace</HI> to be a Judge of the Art. <Q><L>Scribendi recte sapere est, &amp; Principium, &amp; Fons.</L></Q>
And if so, we have Reason to believe, that the same Man who writes well can prescribe well, if he has applied himself to the Study of both. Be∣sides, when we see a Man making Profession of Two different Sciences, it is natural for us to be∣lieve he is no Pretender in that which we are not Judges of when we find him skilful in that which we understand.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="233"/>
Ordinary Quacks and Charlatans are throughly sensible how necessary it is to support themselves by these collateral Assistances, and therefore al∣ways lay their Claim to some supernumerary Ac∣complishments which are wholly foreign to their Profession.</P>
<P>About 20 Years ago, it was impossible to walk the Streets without having an Advertisement thrust into your Hand of a Doctor <HI>who was arrived at the Knowledge of the Green and Red Dragon, and had discovered the Female Fern Seed.</HI> No Body ever knew what this meant; but the Green and Red Dragon so amused the People, that the Doctor li∣ved very comfortably upon them. About the same Time there was pasted a very hard Word upon every Corner of the Streets. This, to the best of my Remembrance, was
<Q>TETRACHYMAGOGON.</Q>
Which drew great Shoals of Spectators about it, who read the Bill that it introduced with un∣speakable Curiosity; and when they were sick, would have no Body but this learned Man for their Physician.</P>
<P>I once received an Advertisement of one <HI>who had studied Thirty Years by Candle-light for the Good of his Countrymen.</HI> He might have studied Twice as long by Day-light, and never have been taken Notice of: But Lucubrations cannot be over-valued. There are some who have gained themselves great Reputation for Physick by their Birth, as the <HI>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son;</HI> and others by not being born at all, as the <HI>Unborn Doctor,</HI> who, I hear, is lately gone the Way of his Patients, having died worth Five Hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> though he was not <HI>born</HI> to a Halfpenny.</P>
<P>My ingenious Friend Doctor <HI>Saffold,</HI> succeeded my old Contemporary Doctor <HI>Lilly</HI> in the Studies both of Physick and Astrology, to which he ad∣ded
<PB N="224" REF="234"/>
that of Poetry, as was to be seen both upon the Sign where he lived, and in the Bills which he distributed. He was succeeded by Doctor <HI>Case,</HI> who erased the Verses of his Predecessor out of the Sign-Post, and substituted in their Stead Two of his own, which were as follow:</P>
<Q><L>Within this Place</L>
<L>Lives Doctor <HI>Case.</HI></L></Q>
<P>He is said to have got more by this Distich, than Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> did by all his Works. There would be no End of enumerating the several imaginary Per∣fections and unaccountable Artifices by which this Tribe of Men ensnare the Minds of the Vulgar, and gain Crowds of Admirers. I have seen the whole Front of a Mountebank's Stage from one End to the other faced with Patents, Certificates, Medals, and Great Seals, by which the several Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> have testified their particular Re∣spect and Esteem for the Doctor. Every great Man with a sounding Title has been his Patient. I be∣lieve I have seen Twenty Mountebanks that have given Physick to the Czar of <HI>Moscovy.</HI> The Great Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI> escapes no better. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> was likewise a very good Patient.</P>
<P>This great Condescension of the Doctor draws upon him much Good-Will from his Audience; and it is Ten to One, but if any of them be trou∣bled with an aching Tooth, his Ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a Person who has had so many Princes, Kings, and Emperors, under his Hands.</P>
<P>I must not leave this Subject without observing, that as Physicians are apt to deal in Poetry, Apo∣thecaries endeavour to recommend themselves by Oratory, and are therefore without Controversy the most eloquent Persons in the whole <HI>British</HI> Na∣tion. I would not willingly discourage any of the Arts, especially that of which I am an humble Pro∣fessor; but I must confess, for the Good of my
<PB N="225" REF="235"/>
native Country, I could wish there might be a Sus∣pension of Physick for some Years, that our King∣dom, which has been so much exhausted by the Wars, might have Leave to recruit it self.</P>
<P>As for my self, the only Physick which has brought me safe to almost the Age of Man, and which I prescribe to all my Friends, is Abstinence. This is certainly the best Physick for Prevention, and very often the most effectual against a present Distemper. In short, my <HI>Recipe</HI> is, <HI>Take nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Were the Body Politick to be physick'd like particular Persons, I should venture to prescribe to it after the same Manner. I remember when our wholeIsland was shaken with an Earthquake some Years ago, there was an impudent Mountebank who sold Pills which (as he told the Country People) were very good against an Earthquake. It may perhaps be thought as absurd to prescribe a Diet for the allaying Popular Commotions, and National Ferments. But I am verily perswaded, that if in such a Case a whole People were to en∣ter into a Course of Abstinence, and eat nothing but Water-gruel for a Fortnight, it would abate the Rage and Animosity of Parties, and not a lit∣tle contribute to the Cure of a distracted Nation. Such a Fast would have a natural Tendency to the procuring of those Ends for which a Fast is usually proclaimed. If any Man has a Mind to enter on such a voluntary Abstinence, it might not be improper to give him the Caution of <HI>Py∣thagoras</HI> in particular:</P>
<Q>Abstine a Fabis.</Q>
<Q>' Abstain from Beans.</Q>
<P>That is, say the Interpreters, Meddle not with Elections, Beans having been made Use of by the Voters among the <HI>Athenians</HI> in the Choice of Ma∣gistrates.</P>

<P>A Method of spending one's Time agreeably is a Thing so little studied, that the common Amusement of our young Gentlemen (especially of such as are at a Distance from those of the first Breeding) is Drinking. This Way of Entertain∣ment has Custom of its Side; but as much as it has prevailed, I believe there have been very few Companies that have been guilty of Excess this Way, where there have not happened more Acci∣dents which make against, than for the Continu∣ance of it. It is very common that Events arise from a Debauch which are fatal, and always such as are disagreeable. With all a Man's Reason and good Sense about him, his Tongue is apt to utter Things out of meer Gaiety of Heart which may displease his best Friends. Who then would trust himself to the Power of Wine, without saying more against it, than that it raises the Imagination, and depresses the Judgment. Were there only this single Consideration, That we are less Masters of our selves when we drink in the least Proportion above the Exigencies of Thirst; I say, were this all that could be objected, it were sufficient to make us abhor this Vice. But we may go on to say, that as he who drinks but a little is not Ma∣ster of himself, so he who drinks much is a Slave to himself. As for my Part, I ever esteemed a Drunkard of all vicious Persons the most vicious: For if our Actions are to be weighed and consi∣dered according to the Intention of them, what can we think of him who puts himself into a Cir∣cumstance
<PB N="227" REF="237"/>
wherein he can have no Intention at all, but incapacitates himself for the Duties and Of∣fices of Life, by a Suspension of all his Faculties. If a Man considered, that he cannot under the Op∣pression of Drink be a Friend, a Gentleman, a Ma∣ster, or a Subject; that he has so long banished himself from all that is dear, and given up all that is sacred to him, he would even then think of a Debauch with Horror: But when he looks still further, and acknowledges, that he is not only expelled out of all the Relations of Life, but also liable to offend against them all, What Words can express the Terror and Detestation he would have of such a Condition? And yet he owns all this of himself who says he was drunk last Night.</P>
<P>As I have all along persisted in it, that all the Vicious in general are in a State of Death, so I think I may add to the Non-Existence of Drunk∣ards, that they died by their own Hands. He is certainly as guilty of Suicide who perishes by a slow, as he that is dispatched by an immediate, Poison. In my last Lucubration I proposed the general Use of Water-gruel, and hinted, that it might not be amiss at this very Season: But as there are some, whose Cases, in regard to their Families, will not admit of Delay, I have used my Interest in several Wards of the City, that the wholesome Restorative above-mentioned may be given in Tavern Kitchens to all the Mornings Draught Men within the Walls when they call for Wine before Noon. For a further Restraint and Mark upon such Persons, I have given Orders, that in all the Offices where Policies are drawn upon Lives, it shall be added to the Article which prohibits that the Nominee should cross the Sea, the Words, <HI>Provided also, That the above-mention∣ed</HI> A. B. <HI>shall not drink before Dinner during the Term mentioned in this Indenture.</HI></P>
<P>I am not without Hopes but by this Method I shall bring some unsizeable Friends of mine into
<PB N="228" REF="238"/>
Shape and Breath, as well as others who are languid and consumptive into Health and Vigour. Most of the Self-Murderers whom I yet hinted at, are such as preserve a certain Regularity in taking their Poison, and make it mix pretty well with their Food: But the most conspicuous of those who destroy themselves, are such as in their Youth fall into this Sort of Debauchery, and contract a certain Uneasiness of Spirit, which is not to be diverted but by Tippling as often as they can fall into Company in the Day, and conclude with downright Drunkenness at Night. These Gen∣tlemen never know the Satisfaction of Youth, but skip the Years of Manhood, and are decrepid soon after they are of Age. I was Godfather to one of these old Fellows. He is now Three and Thirty, which is the Grand Climacterick of a young Drunkard. I went to visit the crazy Wretch this Morning, with no other Purpose but to rally him under the Pain and Uneasiness of being sober.</P>
<P>But as out Faults are double when they affect others besides our selves, so this Vice is still more odious in a married than a single Man. He that is the Husband of a Woman of Honour, and comes Home overloaded with Wine, is still more con∣temptible in Proportion to the Regard we have to the unhappy Consort of his Bestiality. The Ima∣gination cannot shape to its self any Thing more monstrous and unnatural than the Familiarities between Drunkenness and Chastity. The wretch∣ed <HI>Astraea,</HI> who is the Perfection of Beauty and In∣nocence, has long been thus condemned for Life. The Romantick Tales of Virgins devoted to the Jaws of the Monsters, have nothing in them so terrible as the Gift of <HI>Astraea</HI> to that Bacchanal.</P>
<P>The Reflection of such a Match as spotless In∣nocence with abandoned Lewdness, is what puts this Vice in the worst Figure it can bear with Re∣gard to others; but when it is looked upon with Respect only to the Drunkard himself, it has De∣formities
<PB N="229" REF="239"/>
enough to make it disagreeable, which may be summed up in a Word, by allowing, that he who resigns his Reason, is actually guilty of all that he is liable to from the Want of Reason.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> Among many other Enormities, there are Two in the following Letters which I think should be suddenly amended; but since they are Sins of Omission only, I shall not make Remarks upon them till I find the Delinquents persist in their Errors; and the inserting the Letters themselves shall be all their present Admonition.</P>

<P>IT was with very great Displeasure I heard this Day a Man say of a Companion of his with an Air of Approbation, <HI>You know</HI> Tom <HI>never fails of saying a spightful Thing.</HI> He has a great deal of Wit, but Satyr is his particular Talent. <HI>Did you mind how he put the young Fellow out of Counte∣nance that pretended to talk to him?</HI> Such imper∣tinent Applauses, which one meets with every Day, put me upon considering what true Raillery and Satyr were in themselves; and this, me∣thought, occurred to me from Reflection upon the great and excellent Persons that were admi∣red for Talents this Way. When I had ran over several such in my Thoughts, I concluded, (how∣ever unaccountable the Assertion might appear at first Sight) that Good-Nature was an essential Quality in a Satyrist, and that all the Sentiments which are beautiful in this Way of Writing must proceed from that Quality in the Author. Good-Nature produces a Disdain of all Baseness, Vice, and Folly, which prompts them to express them∣selves with Smartness against the Errors of Men, without Bitterness towards their Persons. This Quality keeps the Mind in Equanimity, and ne∣ver lets an Offence unseasonably throw a Man out of his Character. When <HI>Virgil</HI> said, He that did not hate <HI>Bavius</HI> might love <HI>Maevius,</HI> he
<PB N="232" REF="242"/>
was in perfect good Humour, and was not so much moved at their Absurdities, as passionately to call them Sots or Blockheads in a direct In∣vective, but laughed at them with a Delicacy of Scorn, without any Mixture of Anger.</P>
<P><HI>The best good Man, with the worst-natured Muse,</HI> was the Character among us of a Gentleman as famous for his Humanity as his Wit.</P>
<P>The ordinary Subjects for Satyr are such as in∣cite the greatest Indignation in the best Tem∣pers, and consequently Men of such a Make are the best qualified for speaking of the Offences in Humane Life. These Men can behold Vice and Folly when they injure Persons to whom they are wholly unacquainted, with the same Severity as others resent the Ills they do themselves. A good-natured Man cannot see an over-bearing Fellow put a bashful Man of Merit out of Coun∣tenance, or outstrip him in the Pursuit of any Advantage; but he is on Fire to succour the Op∣pressed, to produce the Merit of the one, and confront the Impudence of the other.</P>
<P>The Men of the greatest Character in this Kind were <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Juvenal.</HI> There is not, that I remember, one ill-natured Expression in all their Writings, not one Sentence of Severity which does not apparently proceed from the contrary Disposition. Whoever reads them, will, I be∣lieve, be of this Mind; and if they were read with this View, it may possibly perswade our young Fellows, that they may be very witty Men without speaking ill of any but those who deserve it: But in the Perusal of these Writers it may not be unnecessary to consider, that they lived in very different Times. <HI>Horace</HI> was inti∣mate with a Prince of the greatest Goodness and Humanity imaginable, and his Court was formed after his Example: Therefore the Faults that Poet falls upon were little Inconsistencies in Behaviour, false Pretences to Politeness, or im∣pertinent
<PB N="233" REF="243"/>
Affectations of what Men were not fit for. Vices of a coarser Sort could not come un∣der his Consideration, or enter the Palace of <HI>Au∣gustus. Juvenal</HI> on the other Hand lived under <HI>Domitian,</HI> in whose Reign every Thing that was great and noble was banished the Habitations of the Men in Power. Therefore he attacks Vice as it passes by in Triumph, not as it breaks into Conversation. The Fall of Empire, Contempt of Glory, and a general Degeneracy of Manners, are before his Eyes in all his Writings. In the Days of <HI>Augustus,</HI> to have talked like <HI>Juvenal</HI> had been Madness, or in those of <HI>Domitian</HI> like <HI>Horace.</HI> Morality and Virtue are every where re∣commended in <HI>Horace,</HI> as became a Man in a po∣lite Court, from the Beauty, the Propriety, the Convenience, of pursuing them. Vice and Corruption are attacked by <HI>Juvenal</HI> in a Style which denotes, he fears he shall not be heard without he calls to them in their own Language, with a bare-faced Mention of the Villanies and Obscenities of his Contemporaries.</P>
<P>This accidental Talk of these Two great Men runs me from my Design, which was to tell some Coxcombs that run about this Town with the Name of Smart Satyrical Fellows, that they are by no Means qualified for the Characters they pretend to, of being severe upon other Men, for they want Good-Nature. There is no Founda∣tion in them for arriving at what they aim at; and they may as well pretend to flatter, as rail agreeably without being Good-Natured.</P>
<P>There is a certain Impartiality necessary to make what a Man says bear any Weight with those he speaks to. This Quality, with Respect to Men's Errors and Vices, is never seen but in Good-natured Men. They have ever such a Frankness of Mind, and Benevolence to all Men, that they cannot receive Impressions of Unkind∣ness without mature Deliberation; and writing
<PB N="234" REF="244"/>
or speaking ill of a Man upon Personal Conside∣ratious, is so irreparable and mean an Injury, that no o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ssessed of this Quality is capable of do∣ing it. But in all Ages there have been Interpre∣ters to A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rs when living, of the same Genius with the Commentators, into whose Hands they fall when dead. I dare say, it is impossible for any Man of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e Wit than one of these to take any of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> and twenty Letters, and form out of them a Name to describe the Character of a Vicious Man with greater Life, but one of these would immediately cry, Mr. such a one is meant in that Place. But the Truth of it is, Sa∣tyrists describe the Age, and Backbiters assign their Descriptions to private Men.</P>
<P>In all Terms of Reproof, when the Sentence appears to arise from Personal Hatred or Passion, it is not then made the Cause of Mankind, but a Misunderstanding between Two Persons. For this Reason, the Representations of a Good-na∣tured Man bear a Pleasantry in them, which shows there is no Malignity at heart, and by Consequence are attended to by his Hearers or Readers because they are unprejudiced. This Deference is only what is due to him; for no Man thoroughly nettled can say a Thing general enough to pass off with the Air of an Opinion declared, and not a Passion gratified. I remem∣ber a humorous Fellow at <HI>Oxford,</HI> when he heard any one had spoken ill of him, used to say, <HI>I won't take my Revenge on him till I have forgiven him.</HI> What he meant by this, was, that he would not enter upon this Subject till it was grown as indifferent to him as any other; and I have, by this Rule, seen him more than once triumph over his Adversary with an inimitable Spirit and Humour; for he came to the Assault against a Man full of sore Places, and he himself invulnerable.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="245"/>
There is no Possibility of succeeding in a Sa∣tyrical Way of Writing or Speaking, except a Man throws himself quite out of the Question. It is great Vanity to think any one will attend a Thing because it is your Quarrel. You must make your Satyr the Concern of Society in ge∣neral, if you would have it regarded. When it is so, the Good-Nature of a Man of Wit will prompt him to many brisk and disdainful Senti∣ments and Replies, to which all the Malice in the World will not be able to repartee.</P>

<P>I Have somewhere made Mention of <HI>Gyges</HI>'s Ring, and intimated to my Reader, that it was at present in my Possession, though I have not since made any Use of it. The Tradition con∣cerning this Ring is very Romantick, and taken Notice of both by <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Tully,</HI> who each of them make an admirable Use of it for the Ad∣vancement of Morality. This <HI>Gyges</HI> was the Ma∣ster Shepherd to King <HI>Candaules.</HI> As he was wandering over the Plains of <HI>Lydia,</HI> he saw a great Chasm in the Earth, and had the Curiosity to enter it. After having descended pretty far into it, he found the Statue of an Horse in Brass, with Doors in the Sides of it. Upon opening of them, he found the Body of a dead Man big∣ger than ordinary, with a Ring upon his Fin∣ger,
<PB N="236" REF="246"/>
which he took off, and put it upon his own. The Virtues of it were much greater than he at first imagined; for upon his going into the As∣sembly of Shepherds, he observed, that he was invisible when he turned the Stone of the Ring within the Palm of his Hand, and visible when he turned it towards his Company. Had <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Cicers</HI> been as well versed in the Occult Sciences as I am, they would have found a great deal of Mystick Learning in this Tradition; but it is impossible for an Adept to be understood by one who is not an Adept.</P>
<P>As for my self, I have with much Study and Application arrived at this great Secret of ma∣king my self invisible, and by that Means con∣veying my self where I pleased; or to speak in Rosycrucian Lore, I have entered into the Clefts of the Earth, discovered the Brazen Horse, and robbed the dead Giant of his Ring. The Tradi∣tion says further of <HI>Gyges,</HI> that by the Means of this Ring he gained Admission into the most re∣tired Parts of the Court, and made such Use of those Opportunities, that he at length became King of <HI>Lydia.</HI> For my own Part, I, who have always rather endeavoured to improve my Mind than my Fortune, have turned this Ring to no other Advantage than to get a thorough Insight into the Ways of Men, and to make such Obser∣vations upon the Errors of others as may be use∣ful to the Publick, whatever Effect they may have upon my self.</P>
<P>About a Week ago, not being able to sleep, I got up and put on my magical Ring, and with a Thought transported my self into a Chamber where I saw a Light. I found it inhabited by a celebrated Beauty, though she is of that Species of Women whith we call a Slattern. Her Head∣dress and one of her Shoes lay upon a Chair, her Petticoat in one Corner of the Room, and her Girdle that had a Copy of Verses made upon
<PB N="237" REF="247"/>
it but the Day before, with her Thread Stock∣ings, in the middle of the Floor. I was so foo∣lishly officious, that I could not forbear gather∣ing up her Cloaths together to lay them upon the Chair that stood by her Bed-side, when, to my great Surprise, after a little Muttering, she cried out, <HI>What do you do? Let my Petticoat alone.</HI> I was startled at first, but soon found that she was in a Dream; being one of those who, to use <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Expression, are <HI>so loose of Thought,</HI> that they utter in their Sleep every Thing that passes in their Imagination. I left the Apartment of this Female Rake, and went into her Neigh∣bours, where there lay a Male-Coquet. He had a Bottle of Salts hanging over his Head, and upon the Table, by his Bed-side, <HI>Suckling</HI>'s Poems, with a little Heap of Black Patches on it. His Snuff Box was within Reach on a Chair: But while I was admiring the Disposition which he made of the several Parts of his Dress, his Slumber seemed interrupted by a Pang, that was accompanied by a sudden Oath, as he turned himself over hastily in his Bed. I did not care for seeing him in his nocturnal Pains, and left the Room.</P>
<P>I was no sooner got into another Bed-Chamber, but I heard very harsh Words uttered in a smooth uniform Tone. I was amazed to hear so great a Volubility in Reproach, and thought it too cohe∣rent to be spoken by one asleep; but upon look∣ing nearer, I saw the Head dress of the Person who spoke, which shewed her to be a Female with a Man lying by her Side broad awake, and as quiet as a Lamb. I could not but admire his exemplary Patience, and discovered by his whole Behaviour, that he was then lying under the Dis∣cipline of a Curtain-Lecture.</P>
<P>I was entertained in many other Places with this Kind of Nocturnal Eloquence, but observed, that most of those whom I found awake, were
<PB N="238" REF="248"/>
kept so either by Envy or by Love. Some of these were sighing, and others cursing, in Soliloquy; some hugged their Pillows, and others gnashed their Teeth.</P>
<P>The Covetous I likewise found to be a very wakeful People. I happened to come into a Room where one of them lay sick. His Phy∣sician and his Wife were in close Whisper near his Bed-side. I overheard the Doctor say to the poor Gentlewoman, he cannot possibly live till Five in the Morning. She received it like the Mistress of a Family prepared for all Events. At the same Instant came in a Servant Maid, who said, <HI>Madam, The Undertaker is below according to your Order.</HI> The Words were scarce out of her Mouth, when the sick Man cried out with a fee∣ble Voice, Pray, Doctor, how went Bank-Stock to Day at <HI>'Change?</HI> This melancholy Object made me too serious for diverting my self fur∣ther this Way: But as I was going Home, I saw a Light in a Garret, and entering into it, heard a Voice crying, <HI>And, Hand, Stand, Band, Fann'd, Tann'd.</HI> I concluded him by this and the Furni∣ture of his Room to be a Lunatick; but upon li∣stening a little longer, perceived it was a Poet, writing an Heroick upon the ensuing Peace.</P>
<P>It was now towards Morning, an Hour when Spirits, Witches, and Conjurers are obliged to re∣tire to their own Apartments, and feeling the In∣fluence of it, I was hastening Home, when I saw a Man had got half Way into a Neighbour's House. I immediately called to him, and turn∣ing my Ring, appeared in my proper Person. There is something Magisterial in the Aspect of the <HI>Bickerstaffs,</HI> which made him run away in Confusion.</P>
<P>As I took a Turn or Two in my own Lodging, I was thinking, that, old as I was, I need not go to Bed alone, but that it was in my Power to marry the finest Lady in this Kingdom, if I
<PB N="239" REF="249"/>
would wed her with this Ring. For what a Figure would she that should have it make a Visit, with so perfect a Knowledge as this would give her of all the Scandal in the Town? But instead of en∣deavouring to dispose of my self and it in Matri∣mony, I resolved to lend it to my loving Friend the Author of the <HI>Atalantis,</HI> to furnish a new <HI>Secret History</HI> of <HI>Secret Memoirs.</HI></P>

<P>IT is no easy Matter when People are advancing in any Thing, to prevent their going too fast for want of Patience. This happens in nothing more frequently than in the Prosecution of Stu∣dies. Hence it is, that we meet Crowds who attempt to be eloquent before they can speak. They affect the Flowers of Rhetorick before they understand the Parts of Speech. In the or∣dinary Conversation of this Town, there are so many who can, as they call it, talk well, that there is not One in Twenty that talks to be un∣derstood. This proceeds from an Ambition to excel, or, as the Term is, to shine, in Company. The Matter is not to make themselves under∣stood, but admired. They come together with a certain Emulation, rather than Benevolence. When you fall among such Companions, the safe Way is to give your self up, and let the Orators declaim for your Esteem, and trouble your self
<PB N="240" REF="250"/>
no further. It is said, that a Poet must be born so; but I think it may be much better said of an Orator, especially when we talk of our Town-Poets and Orators; but the Town-Poets are full of Rules and Laws, the Town-Orators go thro' thick and thin, and are, forsooth. Persons of such eminent natural Parts and Knowledge of the World, that they despise all Men as unex∣perienced Scholasticks who wait for an Occasion before they speak, or who speak no more than is necessary. They had half perswaded me to go to the Tavern the other Night, but that a Gentle∣man whispered me, Prithee, <HI>Isaac,</HI> go with us; there is <HI>Tom Varnish</HI> will be there, and he is a Fellow that talks as well as any Man in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>I must confess, when a Man expresses himself well upon any Occasion, and his falling into an Account of any Subject arises from a Desire to oblige the Company, or from Fulness of the Cir∣cumstance it self, so that his speaking of it at large is occasioned only by the Openness of a Companion; I say, in such a Case as this, it is not only pardonable, but agreeable when a Man takes the Discourse to himself; but when you see a Fellow watch for Opportunities for being Copious, it is excessively troublesome. A Man that stammers, if he has Understanding, is to be attended with Patience and good Nature; but he that speaks more than he need, has no Right to such an Indulgence. The Man who has a De∣fect in his Speech takes Pains to come to you, while a Man of a weak Capacity with Fluency of Speech triumphs in out-running you. The Stammerer strives to be fit for your Company; the loquacious Man endeavours to show you, you are not fit for his.</P>
<P>With Thoughts of this Kind do I always enter into that Man's Company who is recommended as a Person that talks well; but if I were to
<PB N="241" REF="251"/>
chuse the People with whom I would spend my Hours of Conversation, they should be certain∣ly such as laboured no farther than to make themselves readily and clearly apprehended, and would have Patience and Curiosity to understand me. To have good Sense, and Ability to express it, are the most essential and necessary Qualities in Companions. When Thoughts rise in us fit to utter, among familiar Friends there needs but very little Care in cloathing them.</P>
<P><HI>Urbanus</HI> is, I take it, a Man one might live with whole Years, and enjoy all the Freedom and Improvement imaginable, and yet be insen∣sible of a Contradiction to you in all the Mi∣stakes you can be guilty of. His great good Will to his Friends has produced in him such a general Deference in his Discourse, that if he differs from you in his Sense of any Thing, he introduces his own Thoughts by some agreeable Circumlocution, or he has often observed such and such a Circumstance that made him of ano∣ther Opinion. Again, where another would be apt to say, This I am confident of, I may pretend to judge of this Matter as well as any Body; <HI>Urbanus</HI> says, I am verily perswaded, I believe one may conclude. In a Word, there is no Man more clear in his Thoughts and Expressions than he is, or speaks with greater Diffidence. You shall hardly find one Man of any Consideration, but you shall observe one of less Consequence form himself after him. This happens to <HI>Urba∣nus;</HI> but the Man who steals from him almost every Sentiment he utters in a whole Week, dis∣guises the Theft, by carrying it with quite a dif∣ferent Air. <HI>Umbratilis</HI> knows <HI>Urbanus</HI>'s doubt∣ful Way of Speaking proceeds from Good-Nature and Good-Breeding, and not from Uncertainty in his Opinions. <HI>Umbratilis</HI> therefore has no more to do but repeat the Thoughts of <HI>Urbanus</HI> in a positive Manner, and appear to the Undiscern∣ing
<PB N="242" REF="252"/>
a wiser Man than the Person from whom he borrows: But those who know him, can see the Servant in his Master's Habit; and the more he struts, the less do his Clothes appear his own.</P>
<P>In Conversation, the Medium is neither to af∣fect Silence or Eloquence; not to value our Ap∣probation, and to endeavour to excel us who are of your Company, are equal Inquiries. The great Enemies therefore to good Company, and those who transgress most against the Laws of Equali∣ty, (which is the Life of it) are, the Clown, the Wit, and the Pedant. A Clown, when he has Sense, is conscious of his Want of Education, and with an aukward Bluntness hopes to keep himself in Countenance, by overthrowing the Use of all polite Behaviour. He takes Advantage of the Restraint good Breeding lays upon others not to offend him to trespass against them, and is under the Man's own Shelter while he intrudes upon him. The Fellows of this Class are very frequent in the Repetition of the Words, Rough and Manly. When these People happen to be by their Fortunes of the Rank of Gentlemen, they defend their other Absurdities by an imper∣tinent Courage; and to help out the Defect of their Behaviour, add their being dangerous to their being disagreeable. This Gentleman (though he displeases, professes to do so, and knowing that, dares still go on to do so) is not so painful a Companion as he who will please you against your Will, and resolves to be a Wit.</P>
<P>This Man upon all Occasions, and whoever he falls in Company with, talks in the same Circle, and in the same Round of Chat which he has learned at one of the Tables of this Coffee-house. As Poetry is in it self an Elevation above ordinary and common Sentiments, so there is no Fop is so very near a Mad-man in indifferent Company as a Poetical one. He is not apprehensive that the
<PB N="243" REF="253"/>
Generality of the World are intent upon the Bu∣siness of their own Fortune and Profession, and have as little Capacity as Curiosity to enter into Matters of Ornament or Speculation. I remem∣ber at a full Table in the City, one of these ubi∣quitary Wits was entertaining the Company with a Soliloquy (for so I call it when a Man talks to those who do not understand him) con∣cerning Wit and Humour. An honest Gentle∣man who sate next to me, and was worth Half a Plumb, stared at him, and observing there was some Sense as he thought, mixed with his Impertinence, whispered me, <HI>Take my Word for it, this Fellow is more Knave than Fool.</HI> This was all my good Friend's Applause of the wittiest Man of Talk that I was ever present at, which wanted nothing to make it excellent but that there was no Occasion for it.</P>
<P>The Pedant is so obvious to Ridicule, that it would be to be one to offer to explain him. He is a Gentleman so well known, that there is none but those of his own Class who do not laugh at and avoid him. Pedantry proceeds from much Reading and little Understanding. A Pe∣dant among Men of Learning and Sense, is like an ignorant Servant giving an Account of a polite Conversation. You may find he has brought with him more than could have en∣tered into his Head without being there, but still that he is not a Bit wiser than if he had not been there at all.</P>

<P>I Am a Black-moor Boy, and have, by my Lady's Order, been christened by the Chap∣lain. The good Man has gone further with me, and told me a great deal of good News; as, that I am as good as my Lady herself as I am a Christian, and many other Things; But for all this, the Parrat who came over with me from our Country is as much esteemed by her as I am. Besides this, the Shock-Dog has a Collar that cost almost as much as mine. I de∣sire also to know, whether now I am a Chri∣stian, I am obliged to dress like a <HI>Turk,</HI> and wear a Turbant. I am,</P>

<P>WHen one considers the Turn which Con∣versation takes in almost every Set of Ac∣quaintance, Club or Assembly, in this Town or Kingdom, one cannot but observe, that in spight of what I am every Day saying, and all the Mo∣ral Writers since the Beginning of the World have said, the Subject of Discourse is generally upon one another's Faults. This in a great Measure proceeds from Self-Conceit, which were to be endured in one or other individual Person; but the Folly has spread it self almost over all the Species; and one cannot only say, <HI>Tom, Jack,</HI> or <HI>Will,</HI> but in general, <HI>That Man is a Coxcomb.</HI> From this Source it is, that any Excellence is faintly received, any Imperfection unmercifully exposed. But if Things were put in a true Light, and we would take Time to consider that Man in his very Nature is an imperfect Being, our Sense of this Matter would be immediately altered, and the Word <HI>Imperfection</HI> would not carry an unhinder Idea than the Word <HI>Humanity.</HI> It is a pleasant Story, that we, forsooth, who are the only imperfect Creatures in the Universe, are the only Beings that will not allow of Imperfection. Some Body has taken Notice, that we stand in the Middle of Existencies, and are by this one Circumstance the most unhappy of all others. The Brutes are guided by Instinct, and know no
<PB N="249" REF="259"/>
Sorrow; the Angels have Knowledge, and they are happy; but Men are govern'd by Opinion, which is I know not what Mixture of Instinct and Knowledge, and are neither indolent nor happy. It is very observable, that Criticks are a People between the Learned and the Ignorant, and by that Situation enjoy the Tranquility of neither. As Criticks stand among Men, so do Men in ge∣neral between Brutes and Angels. Thus every Man as he is a Critick and a Coxcomb, till im∣proved by Reason and Speculation, is ever for∣getting himself, and laying open the Faults of others.</P>
<P>At the same Time that I am talking of the Cruelty of urging People's Faults with Severity, I cannot but bewail some which Men are guilty of for want of Admonition. These are such as they can easily mend, and no Body tells them of; for which Reason I shall make Use of the Penny-Post, (as I have with Success to several young Ladies about turning their Eyes, and holding up their Heads) to certain Gentlemen whom I remark ha∣bitually guilty of what they may reform in a Moment. There is a fat Fellow whom I have long remarked wearing his Breast open in the Midst of Winter, out of an Affectation of Youth. I have therefore sent him just now the following Letter in my Physical Capacity.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>There is a very handsome well-shaped Youth that frequents the Coffee-houses about <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI>

<P>WAS that Ensign of Honour, which you wear, given you by a Prince or a Lady that you have served? If you bear it as an absent Lover, please to hang it on a black Riband; if as a rewarded Soldier, you may have my Licence to continue the red.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Faithful Servant, <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> Censor.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>These little Intimations do great Service, and are very useful, not only to the Persons them∣selves, but to inform others how to conduct them∣selves towards them.</P>
<P>Instead of this honest private Method, or a Friendly one Face to Face, of acquainting People with Things in their Power to explain or amend, the usual Way among People is to take no No∣tice of Things you can help, and nevertheless exposs you for those you cannot.</P>
<P><HI>Plumbeus</HI> and <HI>Levis</HI> are constantly in each others Company: They would, if they took pro∣per Methods, be very agreeable Companions; but they so extravagantly aim at what they are unfit for, and each of them rallies the other so much in the wrong Place, that instead of doing each other the Offices of Friends, they do but in∣struct the rest of the World to laugh at them with more Knowledge and Skill. <HI>Plumbeus</HI> is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a saturnine and sullen Complexion; <HI>Levis,</HI> of a mercurial and airy Disposition. Both these Gen∣tlemen have but very slow Parts, but would mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a very good Figure, did they pursue what they ought. If <HI>Plumbeus</HI> would take to Business, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="251" REF="261"/>
would in a fews Years know the Forms of Orders so well, as to direct and dictate with so much Ease, as to be thought a solid, able, and at the same Time, a sure Man of Dispatch. <HI>Levis,</HI> with a little Reading and coming more into Company, would soon be able to write a Song, or lead up a Country-Dance. Instead of these proper Pur∣suits, in Obedience to their respective Genius's, <HI>Plumbeus</HI> endeavours to be the Man of Pleasure, and <HI>Levis</HI> the Man of Business. This appears in their Speech, and in their Dress: <HI>Plumbeus</HI> is ever egregiously fine, and talking something like Wit; <HI>Levis</HI> is ever extremely grave, and with a silly Face repeating Maxims. These Two pardon each other for affecting what each is incapable of, the one to be wise, and the other gay; but are ex∣tremely critical in their Judgments of each other in their Way towards what they pretend to, <HI>Plumbeus</HI> acknowledges <HI>Levis</HI> a Man of a great Reach, because it is what <HI>Plumbeus</HI> never cared for being thought himself, and <HI>Levis</HI> allows <HI>Plumbeus</HI> to be an agreeable Rake for the same Reason. Now were these dear Friends to be free with each other as they ought to be, they would change Characters, and be both as commendable, instead of being as ridiculous, as their Capacities will admit of.</P>
<P>Were it not too grave, all that I would urge on this Subject is, that Men are bewildered when they consider themselves in any other View than that of Strangers, who are in a Place where it is no great Matter whether they can, or unreasona∣ble to expect they should, have every Thing about them as well as at their own Home. This Way of Thinking is, perhaps, the only one that can put this Being into a proper Posture for the Ease of Society. It is certain, this would reduce all Faults into those which proceed from Malice or Dishonesty: It would quite change our Manner of beholding one another, and nothing that was
<PB N="252" REF="262"/>
not below a Man's Nature would be below his Character. The Arts of this Life would be pro∣per Advances towards the next; and a very good Man would be a very fine Gentleman. As it now is, Humane Life is inverted, and we have not learned half the Knowledge of this World before we are dropping into another. Thus, instead of the Raptures and Contemplations which natural∣ly attend a well-spent Life from the Approach of Eternity, even we old Fellows are afraid of the Ridicule of those who are born since us, and ashamed not to understand, as well as peevish to resign, the Mode, the Fashion, the Ladies, the Fiddles, the Balls, and what not. <HI>Dick Reptile,</HI> who does not want Humour, is very pleasant at our Club when he sees an old Fellow touchy at being laughed at for any Thing that is not in the Mode, and bawls in his Ear, <HI>Prithee don't mind him; tell him thou art mortal.</HI></P>

<P>I Presume to lay before you an Affair of mine, and begs you'le be very sinceir in giving me your Judgment and Advice in this Matter, which is as followes:</P>
<P>A very agreeable young Gentleman, who is endowed with all the good Quallities that can make a Man compleat, has this long Time maid Love to me in the most passionat Manner that was posable. He has left nothing unsaid to make me belive his Affections real; and in his Letters expressed himself so hansomly, and so tenderly, that I had all the Reason imaginable to belive him sinceir. In short, he positively has promised me he would marry me: But I find all he said nothing; for when the Question was put to him, he wouldn't; but still would con∣tinue my Humble Servant, and would go on at the ould Rate, repeating the Assurences of his Fidelity (and at the same Time has none in him). He now writs to me in the same endear∣ing Style he ust to do, would have me spake to no Man but himself. His Estate is in his oune Hand, his Father being dead. My Fortune at my oune Disposal, (mine being also dead) and to the full answers his Estate. Pray, Sir, be in∣geinous, and tell me cordially, if you don't think I shall do my self an Injurey if I keep Company or a Corospondance any longer with this Gentleman. I hope you'le faver an honest <HI>North Briton</HI> (as I am) with your Advice in this Amoure; for I am resolved just to folow your Directions. Sir, you'le do me a sensable Plea∣sure, and very great Honour, if you'le pleas to insirt this poor Scrole, with your Answer to it, in your <HI>Tatler.</HI> Pray fail not to give

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have frequently read over your Letter, and am of Opinion, that as lamentable as it is, it is the most common of any Evil that attends our Sex. I am very much troubled for the Ten∣derness you express towards your Lover, but rejoice at the same Time that you can so far surmount your Inclination for him as to resolve to dismiss him when you have my Brother's Opinion for it. His Sense of the Matter, he de∣sired me to communicate to you. Oh <HI>Almei∣ra!</HI> The common Failing of our Sex is to value the Merit of our Lovers rather from the Grace of their Address, than the Sincerity of their Hearts. <HI>He has expressed himself so handsomely!</HI> Can you say, that after you have Reason to doubt his Truth? It is a very melancholy Thing, that in this Circumstance of Love (which is the most important of all others in Female Life) we Women, who are, they say, always weak, are still weakest. The true Way of va∣luing a Man, is to consider his Reputation among the Men: For Want of this necessary Rule towards her Conduct, when it is too late, we find our selves married to the Outcasts of that Sex; and it is generally from being dis∣agreeable among Men, that Fellows endeavour to make themselves pleasing to us. The little Accomplishments of coming into a Room with a good Air, and telling while they are with us what we cannot hear among our selves, usually make up the whole of a Woman's Man's Merit. But if we, when we began to reflect upon our Lover, in the first Place considered what Figures they make in the Camp, at the Bar, on the <HI>'Change,</HI> in their Country, or at Court, we should
<PB N="255" REF="265"/>
behold them in quite another View than at pre∣sent.</P>
<P>Were we to behave our selves according to this Rule, we should not have the just Imputa∣tion of favouring the silliest of Mortals, to the great Scandal of the wisest, who value our Fa∣vour as it advances their Pleasure, not their Reputation. In a Word, Madam, if you would judge aright in Love, you must look upon it as in a Case of Friendship. Were this Gentleman treating with you for any Thing but your self, when you had consented to his Offer, if he fell off, you would call him a Cheat and an Impostor. There is therefore nothing left for you to do, but to despise him and your self for doing with Re∣gret.</P>

<P>I have heard it often argued in Conversation, that this Evil Practice is owing to the perverted Tast of the Wits in the last Generation. A Li∣bertine on the Throne could very easily make the Language and the Fashion turn his own Way. Hence it is, that Woman is treated as a Mistress, and not a Wife. It is from the Writings of those Times, and the traditional Accounts of the De∣bauches of their Men of Pleasure, that the Cox∣combs now-a-days take upon them, forsooth, to be false Swains and perjured Lovers. Methinks I feel all the Woman rise in me, when I reflect upon the nauseous Rogues that pretend to deceive us. Wretches, that can never have it in their Power to over-reach any Thing living but their Mistresses! In the Name of Goodness, if we are designed by Nature as suitable Companions to the other Sex, Why are we not treated accordingly? If we have Merit, as some allow, Why is it not as base in Men to injure us as one another? If we are the Insignificants that others call us, Where is
<PB N="256" REF="266"/>
the Triumph in deceiving us? But when I look at the Bottom of this Disaster, and recollect the many of my Acquaintance whom I have known in the same Condition with the <HI>Northern Lass</HI> that occasions this Discourse, I must own I have ever found the Perfidiousness of Men has been ge∣nerally owing to ourselves, and we have contri∣buted to our own Deceit. The Truth is, we do not conduct our selves as we are courted, but as we are inclined. When we let our Imaginations take this unbridled Swing, it is not he that acts best is most lovely, but he that is most lovely acts best. When our humble Servants make their Ad∣dresses, we do not keep our selves enough disinga∣ged to be Judges of their Merit; and we seldom give our Judgment of our Lover, till we have lost our Judgment of him.</P>
<P>While <HI>Clarinda</HI> was passionately attended and addressed to by <HI>Strephon,</HI> who is a Man of Sense and Knowledge in the World; and <HI>Cassio,</HI> who has a plentiful Fortune and an excellent Understand∣ing, she fell in Love with <HI>Damon</HI> at a Ball: From that Moment she that was before the most rea∣sonable Creature of all my Acquaintance, cannot hear <HI>Strephon</HI> speak, but it is something so out <HI>of the Way of Ladies Conversation:</HI> And <HI>Cassio</HI> has ne∣ver since opened his Mouth before us, but she whispers me, <HI>How seldom do Riches and Sense go together?</HI> The Issue of all this is, that for the Love of <HI>Damon,</HI> who has neither Experience, Understanding, or Wealth, she despises those Ad∣vantages in the other Two which she finds want∣ing in her Lover; or else thinks he has them for no Reason but because he is her Lover. This and many other Instances may be given in this Town; but I hope thus much may suffice to prevent the Growth of such Evils at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>

<P>IT may perhaps appear ridiculous; but I must confess, this last Summer as I was riding in <HI>Enfield Chase,</HI> I met a young Lady whom I could hardly get out of my Head, and for ought I know my Heart, ever since. She was mounted on a Pad, with a very well-fancied Furniture. She sate her Horse with a very graceful Air; and when I saluted her with my Hat, she bowed to me so obligingly, that whether it was her Civility or Beauty that touched me so much, I know not, but I am sure I shall never forget her. She dwells in my Imagination in a Figure so much to her Advantage, that if I were to draw a Picture of Youth, Health, Beauty, or Modesty, I should re∣present any or all of them in the Person of that young Woman.</P>
<P>I do not find that there are any Descriptions in the ancient Poets so beautiful as those they draw of Nymphs in their Pastoral Dresses and Exercises. <HI>Virgil</HI> gives <HI>Venus</HI> the Habit of a <HI>Spartan</HI> Hun∣tress when she is to put <HI>Aeneas</HI> in his Way, and relieve his Cares with the most agreeable Object imaginable. <HI>Diana</HI> and her Train are always described as Inhabitants of the Woods, and Fol∣lowers of the Chase. To be well diverted, is the safest Guard to Innocence; and, methinks, it
<PB N="258" REF="268"/>
should be one of the first Things to be regarded among People of Condition to find out proper Amusements for young Ladies. I cannot but think this of Riding might easily be revived a∣mong them, when they consider how much it must contribute to their Beauty. This would lay up the best Portion they could bring into a Fami∣ly, a good Stock of Health, to transmit to their Posterity. Such a charming Bloom as this gives the Countenance, is very much preferable to the real or affected Feebleness or Softness, which ap∣pear in the Faces of our modern Beauties.</P>
<P>The Comedy, called, <HI>The Ladies Cure,</HI> repre∣sents the Affectation of wan Looks and languid Glances to a very entertaining Extravagance. There is, as the Lady in the Play complains, something so robust in perfect Health, that it is with her a Point of Breeding and Delicacy to ap∣pear in publick with a sickly Air. But the natu∣ral Gaiety and Spirit which shine in the Com∣plexion of such as form to themselves a Sort of diverting Industry by chusing Recreations that are Exercises, surpass all the false Ornaments and Graces that can be put on by applying the whole Dispensary of a Toilet. An healthy Body and a chearful Mind give Charms as irresistible as ini∣mitable. The Beauteous <HI>Dictynna,</HI> who came to Town last Week, has from the constant Prospect in a delicious Country, and the moderate Exer∣cise and Journeys in the Visits she made round it, contracted a certain Life in her Countenance which will in vain employ both the Painters and Poets to represent. The becoming Negligence in her Dress, the severe Sweetness of her Looks, and a certain innocent Boldness in all her Behaviour, are the Effect of the active Recreations I am talk∣ing of.</P>
<P>But instead of such or any other as innocent and pleasing Method of passing away their Time with Alacrity, we have many in Town who
<PB N="259" REF="269"/>
spend their Hours in an indolent State of Body and Mind, without either Recreations or Re∣flections. I am apt to believe, there are some Pa∣rents imagine their Daughters will be accomplish∣ed enough, if nothing interrupts their Growth or their Shape. According to this Method of Education, I could name you Twenty Families, where all the Girls hear of in this Life is, That it is Time to rise and to come to Dinner; as if they were so insignificant as to be wholly pro∣vided for when they are fed and cloathed.</P>
<P>It is with great Indignation that I see such Crowds of the Female World lost to humane So∣ciety, and condemned to a Laziness, which makes Life pass away with less Relish than in the hard∣est Labour. <HI>Palestris</HI> in her Drawing-Room, is supported by Spirits to keep off the Returns of Spleen and Melancholy, before she can get over half the Day for want of something to do, while the Wench in the Kitchen sings and scowrs from Morning to Night.</P>
<P>The next disagreeable Thing to a lazy Lady, is a very busy one. A Man of Business in good Company, who gives an Account of his Abilities and Dispatches, is hardly more insupportable than her they call a Notable Woman, and a Ma∣nager. Lady <HI>Goodday,</HI> where I visited the other Day at a very polite Circle, entertained a great Lady with a <HI>Recipe</HI> for a Poultice, and gave us to understand, that she had done extraordinary Cures since she was last in Town. It seems a Countryman had wounded himself with his Sithe as he was Mowing; and we were obliged to hear of her Charity, her Medicine, and her Humility, in the harshest Tone, and coursest Language ima∣ginable.</P>
<P>What I would request in all this Prattle is, that our Females would either let us have their Per∣sons or their Minds in such Perfection as Nature designed them.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="270"/>
The Way to this is, that those who are in the Quality of Gentlewomen should propose to them∣selves some suitable Method of passing away their Time. This would furnish them with Reflections and Sentiments proper for the Companions of reasonable Men, and prevent the unnatural Mar∣riages which happen every Day between the most accomplished Women, and the veriest Oafs; the worthiest Men, and the most insignificant Females. Were the general Turn of Womens Education of another Kind than it is at present, we should want one another for more Reasons than we do as the World now goes. The common Design of Pa∣rents is to get their Girls off as well as they can, and make no Conscience of putting into our Hands a Bargain for our whole Life, which will make our Hearts ake every Day of it.</P>
<P>I shall therefore take this Matter into serious Consideration, and will propose, for the better Improvement of the Fair Sex, a <HI>Female Library.</HI> This Collection of Books shall consist of such Authors as do not corrupt while they divert, but shall tend more immediately to improve them, as they are Women. They shall be such as shall not hurt a Feature by the Austerity of their Reflections, nor cause one impertinent Glance by the Wanton∣ness of them. They shall all tend to advance the Value of their Innocence as Virgins, improve their Understanding as Wives, and regulate their Ten∣derness as Parents. It has been very often said in these Lucubrations, that the Ideas which most frequently pass through our Imaginations, leave Traces of themselves in our Countenances. There shall be a strict Regard had to this in my Female Library, which shall be furnished with nothing that shall give Supplies to Ostentation or Imper∣tinence, but the whole shall be so digested for the Use of my Students, that they shall not go out of Character in their Enquiries, but their Knowledge appear only a cultivated Innocence.</P>

<P>I Was last Night visited by a Friend of mine who has an inexhaustible Fund of Discourse, and never fails to entertain his Company with a Variety of Thoughts and Hints that are altogether new and uncommon. Whether it were in Com∣plaisance to my Way of Living, or his real Opi∣nion, he advanced the following Paradox, That it required much greater Talents to fill up and become a retired Life, than a Life of Business. Upon this Occasion he rallied very agreeably the busie Men of the Age, who only valued them∣selves of being in Motion, and passing through a Series of trifling and insignificant Actions. In the Heat of his Discourse, seeing a Piece of Money lying on my Table, I defie (says he) any of these active Persons to produce half the Adventures that this Twelvepenny-Piece has been engaged in, were it possible for him to give us an Account of his Life.</P>
<P>My Friend's Talk made so odd an Impression upon my Mind, that soon after I was a-Bed I fell insensibly into a most unaccountable <HI>Resverie,</HI> that had neither Moral nor Design in it, and can∣not be so properly called a Dream as a Delirium.</P>
<P>Methoughts the Shilling that lay upon the Ta∣ble reared it self upon its Edge, and turning the Face towards me, opened its Mouth, and in a soft
<PB N="262" REF="272"/>
Silver Sound gave me the following Account of his Life and Adventures:</P>
<P>I was born, says he, on the Side of a Mountain, near a little Village of <HI>Peru,</HI> and made a Voyage to <HI>England</HI> in an Ingot, under the Convoy of Sir <HI>Francis Drake.</HI> I was, soon after my Arri∣val, taken out of my <HI>Indian</HI> Habit, refined, na∣turalized, and put into the <HI>British</HI> Mode, with the Face of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> on one Side, and the Arms of the Country on the other. Being thus equipped, I found in me a wonderful Inclination to ramble, and visit all the Parts of the new World into which I was brought. The People very much favoured my natural Disposition, and shifted me so fast from Hand to Hand, that before I was Five Years old, I had travelled into almost every Corner of the Nation. But in the Begin∣ning of my Sixth Year, to my unspeakable Grief, I fell into the Hands of a miserable old Fellow, who clapped me into an Iron Chest, where I found Five Hundred more of my own Quality who lay under the same Confinement. The only Relief we had, was to be taken out and counted over in the fresh Air every Morning and Evening. After an Imprisonment of several Years, we heard some Body knocking at our Chest, and breaking it open with an Hammer. This we found was the old Man's Heir, who, as his Father lay a dy∣ing, was so good as to come to our Release: He separated us that very Day. What was the Fate of my Companions, I know not: As for my self, I was sent to the Apothecary's Shop for a Pint of Sack. The Apothecary gave me to an Herb-Wo∣man, the Herb-Woman to a Butcher, the Butcher to a Brewer, and the Brewer to his Wife, who made a Present of me to a Nonconformist Prea∣cher. After this Manner I made my Way merri∣ly through the World; for, as I told you before, we Shillings love nothing so much as travelling. I sometimes fetched in a Shoulder of Mutton
<PB N="263" REF="273"/>
sometimes a Play-Book, and often had the Satis∣faction to treat a Templer at a Twelvepenny Or∣dinary, or carry him with Three Friends to <HI>West∣minster-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>In the Midst of this pleasant Progress which I made from Place to Place, I was arrested by a su∣perstitious old Woman, who shut me up in a greazy Purse, in Pursuance of a foolish Saying, That while she kept a Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Shilling about her, she should never be without Money. I continued here a close Prisoner for many Months, till at last I was exchanged for Eight and Forty Farthings.</P>
<P>I thus rambled from Pocket to Pocket till the Beginning of the Civil Wars, when (to my Shame be it spoken) I was employed in raising Soldiers against the King: For being of a very tempting Breadth, a Serjeant made Use of me to inveigle Country Fellows, and list them in the Service of the Parliament.</P>
<P>As soon as he had made one Man sure, his Way was to oblige him to take a Shilling of a more homely Figure, and then practise the same Trick upon another. Thus I continued doing great Mischief to the Crown, till my Officer chancing one Morning to walk Abroad earlier than ordina∣ry, sacrificed me to his Pleasures, and made Use of me to seduce a Milk-Maid. This Wench bent me, and gave me to her Sweetheart, applying more properly than she intended the usual Form of, <HI>To my Love and from my Love.</HI> This unge∣nerous Gallant marrying her within few Days after, pawned me for a Dram of Brandy, and drinking me out next Day, I was beaten flat with an Hammer, and again set a running.</P>
<P>After many Adventures, which it would be te∣dious to relate, I was sent to a young Spendthrift, in Company with the Will of his deceased Fa∣ther. The young Fellow, who I found was very extravagant, gave great Demonstrations of Joy at
<PB N="264" REF="274"/>
the Receiving the Will; but opening it, he found himself disinherited and cut off from the Posses∣sion of a fair Estate, by Vertue of my being made a Present to him. This put him into such a Pas∣sion, that after having taken me in his Hand, and cursed me, he squirred me away from him as far as he could fling me. I chanced to light in an unfrequented Place under a dead Wall, where I lay undiscovered and useless, during the Usurpa∣tion of <HI>Oliver Cromwell.</HI></P>
<P>About a Year after the King's Return, a poor Cavalier that was walking there about Dinner∣time fortunately cast his Eye upon me, and, to the great Joy of us both, carried me to a Cook's-Shop, where he dined upon me, and drank the King's Health. When I came again into the World, I found that I had been happier in my Retirement than I thought, having probably by that Means escaped wearing a monstrous Pair of Breeches.</P>
<P>Being now of great Credit and Antiquity, I was rather looked upon as a Medal than an ordi∣nary Coin; for which Reason a Gamester laid hold of me, and converted me into a Counter, ha∣ving got together some Dozens of us for that Use. We led a melancholy Life in his Possession, being busy at those Hours wherein Current Coin is at rest, and partaking the Fate of our Master, being in a few Moments valued at a Crown, a Pound, or a Sixpence, according to the Situation in which the Fortune of the Cards placed us. I had at length the good Luck to see my Master break, by which Means I was again sent Abroad under my primitive Denomination of a Shil∣ling.</P>
<P>I shall pass over many other Accidents of less Moment, and hasten to that fatal Catastrophe when I fell into the Hands of an Artist who con∣veyed me under Ground, and with an unmerciful Pair of Sheers cut off my Titles, clipped my
<PB N="265" REF="275"/>
Brims, retrenched my Shape, rubbed me to my inmost Ring, and, in short, so spoiled and pillaged me, that he did not leave me worth a Groat. You may think what a Confusion I was in to see my self thus curtailed and disfigured. I should have been ashamed to have shown my Head, had not all my old Acquaintance been reduced to the same shameful Figure, excepting some few that were punched through the Belly. In the midst of this general Calamity, when every Body thought our Misfortune irretrievable, and our Case desperate, we were thrown into the Furnace together, and (as it often happens with Cities ri∣sing out of a Fire) appeared with greater Beauty and Lustre than we could ever boast of before. What has happened to me since this Change of Sex which you now see, I shall take some other Opportunity to relate. In the mean Time I shall only repeat Two Adventures, as being very ex∣traordinary, and neither of them having ever happened to me above once in my Life. The First was, my being in a Poet's Pocket, who was so taken with the Brightness and Novelty of my Appearance, that it gave Occasion to the finest Burlesque Poem in the <HI>British</HI> Language, entitu∣ed from me, <HI>The Splendid Shilling.</HI> The Second Adventure, which I must not omit, happened to me in the Year 1703, when I was given away in Charity to a blind Man; but indeed this was by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mistake, the Person who gave me having heed∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esly thrown me into the Hat among a Penny∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth of Farthings.</P>

<P>I Last Winter erected a Court of Justice for the correcting of several Enormities in Dress and Behaviour, which are not cognizable in any other Courts of this Realm. The Vintner's Case which I there tryed is still fresh in every Man's Memo∣ry. That of the Petticoat gave also a general Satisfaction, not to mention the more important Points of the Cane and Perspective; in which, if I did not give Judgments and Decrees according to the strictest Rules of Equity and Justice, I can safely say, I acted according to the best of my Understanding. But as for the Proceedings of that Court, I shall refer my Reader to an Ac∣count of them, written by my Secretary, which is now in the Press, and will shortly be published under the Title of <HI>Lillie</HI>'s <HI>Reports.</HI></P>
<P>As I last Year presided over a Court of Justice, it is my intention this Year to set my self at the Head of a Court of Honour. There is no Court o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Nature any where at present, except in <HI>France,</HI> where, according to the best of my in∣telligence, it consists of such only as are Marshals of that Kingdom. I am likewise informed, that there is not one of that honourable Board at pre∣sent who has not been driven out of the Field by the Duke of <HI>Marlborough:</HI> But whether this be only an accidental or a necessary Qualification, I must confess I am not able to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="277"/>
As for the Court of Honour of which I am here speaking, I intend to sit my self in it as Pre∣sident, with several Men of Honour on my Right Hand, and Women of Virtue on my Left, as my Assistants. The First Place of the Bench I have given to an old <HI>Tangereen</HI> Captain with a Wooden Leg. The Second is a Gentleman of a long twisted Periwig without a Curl in it, a Muff with very little Hair upon it, and a Thread-bare Coat with new Buttons, being a Person of great Worth, and Second Brother to a Man of Quali∣ty. The Third is a Gentleman-Usher, extreamly well read in Romances, and Grandson to one of the greatest Wits in <HI>Germany,</HI> who was some Time Master of the Ceremonies to the Duke of <HI>Wolfembuttel.</HI></P>
<P>As for those who sit further on my Right Hand, as it is usual in publick Courts, they are such as will fill up the Number of Faces up∣on the Bench, and serve rather for Ornament than Use.</P>
<P>The chief upon my Left Hand are, an old Mai∣den Lady, that preserves some of the best Blood of <HI>England</HI> in her Veins.</P>
<P>A <HI>Welsh</HI> Woman of a little Stature, but high Spirit.</P>
<P>An old Prude that has censured every Marriage for these Thirty Years, and is lately wedded to a young Rake.</P>
<P>Having thus furnished my Bench, I shall esta∣blish Correspondencies with the Horse-Guards, and the Veterans of <HI>Chelsea College;</HI> the former to furnish me with Twelve Men of Honour as often as I shall have Occasion for a Grand Jury, and the latter with as many good Men and true for a Petty Jury.</P>
<P>As for the Women of Virtue, it will not be difficult for me to find them about Midnight at Crimp and Basset.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="278"/>
Having given this publick Notice of my Court, I must further add, that I intend to open it on this Day Sevennight, being <HI>Monday</HI> the Twen∣tieth Instant; and do hereby invite all such as have suffered Injuries and Astronts, that are not to be redressed by the common Laws of this Land, whether they be short Bows, cold Saluta∣tions, supercilious Looks, unreturned Smiles, di∣stant Behaviour, or forced Familiarity; as also all such as have been aggrieved by any ambiguous Expression, accidental Justle, or unkind Repartee; likewise all such as have been defrauded of their Right to the Wall, tricked out of the upper End of the Table, or have been suffered to place them∣selves in their own Wrong on the Back-Seat of the Coach: These, and all of these, I do, as I above said, invite to bring in their several Cases and Complaints, in which they shall be relieved with all imaginable Expedition.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, that the Office I have now taken upon me will engage me in the Disquisi∣tion of many weighty Points that daily perplex the Youth of the <HI>British</HI> Nation, and therefore I have already discussed several of them for my fu∣ture Use; as, How far a Man may brandish his Cane in the telling a Story, without insulting his Hearer? What Degree of Contradiction amounts to the Lye? How a Man should resent another's staring and cocking a Hat in his Face? If asking Pardon is an Attonement for treading upon ones Toes? Whether a Man may put up a Box on the Ear received from a Stranger in the Dark? Or, Whether a Man of Honour may take a Blow of his Wife? With several other Subtilties of the like Nature.</P>
<P>For my Direction in the Duties of my Office, I have furnished my self with a certain Astrologi∣cal Pair of Scales which I have contrived for this Purpose. In one of them I lay the Injuries, in the other the Reparations. The first are repre∣sented
<PB N="269" REF="279"/>
by little Weights made of a Metal resem∣bling Iron, and the other in Gold. These are not only lighter than the Weights made use of in Averdupois, but also than such as are used in Troy-Weight. The heaviest of those that repre∣sent the Injuries amount but to a Scruple; and decrease by so many Sub-divisions, that there are several imperceptible Weights which cannot be seen without the Help of a very fine Microscope. I might acquaint my Reader, that these Scales were made under the Influence of the Sun when he was in <HI>Libra,</HI> and describe many Signatures on the Weights both of Injury and Reparation: But as this would look rather to proceed from an Ostentation of my own Art than any Care for the Publick, I shall pass it over in Silence.</P>

<P>IT is necessary to an easy and happy Life, to possess our Minds in such a Manner as to be always well satisfied with our own Reflections.
<PB N="270" REF="280"/>
The Way to this State, is to measure our Actions by our own Opinion, and not by that of the rest of the World. The Sense of other Men ought to prevail over us in Things of less Consideration, but not in Concerns where Truth and Honour are engaged. When we look into the Bottom of Things, what at first appears a Paradox, is a plain Truth; and those Professions which, for Want of being duly weighed, seem to proceed from a Sort of Romantick Philosophy, and Ignorance of the World, after a little Reflection are so reasonable, that it is direct Madness to walk by any other Rules. Thus to contradict our Desires, and to conquer the Impulses of our Ambition, if they do not fall in with what we in our inward Senti∣ments approve, is so much our Interest, and so absolutely necessary to our real Happiness, that to contemn all the Wealth and Power in the World, where they stand in Competition with a Man's Honour, is rather good Sense than Greatness of Mind.</P>
<P>Did we consider that the Mind of a Man is the Man himself, we should think it the most unna∣tural Sort of Self-Murther to sacrifice the Senti∣ment of the Soul to gratify the Appetites of the Body. Bless us! Is it possible, that when the Necessities of Life are supplied, a Man would flatter to be rich, or circumvent to be powerful? When we meet a poor Wretch urged with Hun∣ger and Cold asking an Alms, we are apt to think this a State we could rather starve than submit to: But yet how much more despicable is his Condition who is above Necessity, and yet shall resign his Reason and his Integrity to purchase Superfluities? These are both abject and common Beggars; but sure it is less despicable to beg a Supply to a Man's Hunger than his Vanity. But Custom and general Prepossessions have so far prevailed over an unthinking World, that those necessitous Creatures who cannot relish Life
<PB N="271" REF="281"/>
without Applause, Attendance, and Equipage, are so far from making a contemptible Figure, that distressed Virtue is less esteemed than suc∣cessful Vice. But if a Man's Appeal in Cases that regarded his Honour were made to his own Soul, there would be a Bafis and standing Rule for our Conduct, and we should always endeavour ra∣ther to be than appear honourable. Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> in his Essay on <HI>Fortitude,</HI> has treated this Subject with great Wit and Magnanimity. <HI>What</HI> (says he) <HI>can be more honourable than to have Courage enough to execute the Commands of Reason and Con∣science; to maintain the Dignity of our Nature, and the Station assigned us? To be Proof against Poverty, Pain, and Death it self? I mean so far as not to do any Thing that's scandalous or sinful to avoid them? To stand Adversity under all Shapes with Decency and Resolution? To do this, is to be great above Title and Fortune. This argues the Soul of an Heavenly Extraction, and is worthy the Offspring of the Deity.</HI></P>
<P>What a generous Ambition has this Man point∣ed to us? When Men have settled in themselves a Conviction by such noble Precepts, that there is nothing honourable that is not accompanied with Innocence; nothing mean but what has Guilt in it; I say, when they have attained thus much, though Poverty, Pain, and Death, may still retain their Terrors, yet Riches, Pleasures, and Honours, will easily lose their Charms, if they stand between us and our Integrity.</P>
<P>What is here said with Allusion to Fortune and Fame, may as justly be applied to Wit and Beau∣ty; for these latter are as adventitious as the o∣ther, and as little concern the Essence of the Soul. They are all laudable in the Man who pos∣sesses them only for the just Application of them. A bright Imagination, while it is subservient to an honest and noble Soul, is a Faculty which makes a Man justly admired by Mankind, and
<PB N="272" REF="282"/>
furnishes him with Reflections upon his own Actions, which add Delicates to the Feast of a good Conscience: But when Wit descends to wait upon sensual Pleasures, or promote the base Purposes of Ambition, it is then to be contemned in Proportion to its Excellence. If a Man will not resolve to place the Foundation of his Happi∣ness in his own Mind, Life is a bewildered and unhappy State, incapable of Rest or Tranquillity: For to such a one the general Applause of Valour, Wit, nay of Honesty it self, can give him but a very feeble Comfort, since it is capable of being interrupted by any one who wants either Under∣standing or Good-nature to see or acknowledge such Excellencies. This Rule is so necessary, that one may very safely say, it is impossible to know any true Relish of our Being without it. Look about you in common Life among the ordinary Race of Mankind, and you will find Merit in every Kind is allowed only to those who are in particular Districts or Sets of Company: But since Men can have little Pleasure in these Facul∣ties which denominate them Persons of Distin∣ction, let them give up such an empty Pursuit, and think nothing essential to Happiness but what is in their own Power, the Capacity of reflecting with Pleasure on their own Actions, however they are interpreted.</P>
<P>It is so evident a Truth, that it is only in our own Bosoms we are to search for any Thing to make us happy, that it is, methinks, a Dis∣grace to our Nature to talk of the taking our Measures from thence only as a Matter of For∣titude. When all is well there, the Vicissitudes and Distinctions of Life are the meer Scenes of a Drama, and he will never act his Part well who has his Thoughts more fixed upon the Applause of the Audience than the Design of his Part.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="283"/>
The Life of a Man who acts with a steady Inte∣grity, without valuing the Interpretation of his Actions, has but one uniform regular Path to move in, where he cannot meet Opposition, or fear Am∣buscade. On the other Side, the least Deviation from the Rules of Honour introduces a Train of numberless Evils, and involves him in inexplica∣ble Mazes. He that has entred into Guilt has bid Adieu to Rest, and every Criminal has his Share of the Misery expressed so emphatically in the Tra∣gedian;</P>
<Q><L>Mackbeth shall sleep no more!</L></Q>
<P>It was with Detestation of any other Grandeur but the calm Command of his own Passion, that the excellent Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> cries out with so much Justice;</P>
<Q><L>If e're Ambition did my Fancy cheat,</L>
<L>With any Thought so mean as to be great,</L>

<P>THE following Letter, and several others to the same Purpose, accuse me of a Rigour of which I am far from being guilty, to wit, the disallowing the chearful Use of Wine.</P>
<LETTER>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my Country-house, <DATE>Oct. 25.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur Discourse against Drinking, in <HI>Tuesday's Tatler,</HI> I like well enough in the main; but in my humble Opinion, you are become too ri∣gid where you say to this Effect: [Were there only this single Consideration, that we are the less Masters of our selves if we drink the least Proportion beyond the Exigence of Thirst.] I hope no one drinks Wine to allay this Appetite. This seems to be designed for a loftier Indulgence of Nature; for it were hard to suppose, that the Author of Nature, who imposed upon her her Necessities and Pains, does not allow her her Pleasures, and we may reckon among the latter the moderate Use of the Grape: And though I am as much against Excess, or whatever ap∣proaches it, as your self, yet I conceive one may safely go farther than the Bounds you there pre∣scribe, not only without forfeiting the Title of being one's own Master, but also to possess it in a much greater Degree. If a Man's expressing himself upon any Subject with more Life and Vivacity, more Variety of Idea's, more copious∣ly, more fluently, and more to the Purpose, ar∣gues it he thinks clearer, speaks more ready, and with greater Choice of comprehensive and significant Terms. I have the good Fortune now to be intimate with a Gentleman remark∣able for this Temper, who has an inexhaustible Source of Wit to entertain the Curious, the Grave, the Humorous, and the Frolick. He can transform himself into different Shapes, and a∣dapt himself to every Company; yet in a Cof∣fee-house, or in the ordinary Course of Affairs, appears rather dull than sprightly. You can seldom get him to the Tavern, but when once he is is arrived to his Pint, and begins to look a∣bout and like his Company, you admire a Thou∣sand
<PB N="275" REF="285"/>
Things in him, which before lay buried. Then you discover the Brightness of his Mind, and the Strength of his Judgment, accompanied with the most graceful Mirth. In a Word, by this enlivening Aid, he is whatever is polite, instructive, and diverting. What makes him still more agreeable is, that he tells a Story, serious or comical, with as much Delicacy of Humour as <HI>Cervantes</HI> himself. And for all this, at other Times, even after a long Knowledge of him, you shall scarce discern in this incomparable Person a whit more than what might be ex∣pected from one of a common Capacity. Doubt∣less, there are Men of great Parts that are guilty of downright Bashfulness, that by a strange He∣sitation and Reluctance to speak, murder the fi∣nest and most elegant Thoughts, and render the most lively Conceptions flat and heavy.</P>
<P>In this Case, a certain Quantity of my White or Red Cordial, which you will, is an easie, but an infallible Remedy. It awakens the Judgment, quickens Memory, ripens Understanding, dis∣perses Melancholy, chears the Heart; in a Word, restores the whole Man to himself and his Friends without the least Pain or Indisposi∣tion to the Patient. To be taken only in the Evening in a reasonable Quantity before going to Bed. <HI>Note,</HI> My Bottles are sealed with Three Flower-de-Luces and a Bunch of Grapes. Be∣ware of Counterfeits. I am</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Whatever has been said against the Use of Wine, upon the Supposition that it enfeebles the Mind, and renders it unfit for the Duties of Life, bears forcibly to the Advantage of that delicious Juice, in Cases where it only heightens Conversation, and brings to Light agreeable Talents, which otherwise would have lain concealed under the
<PB N="276" REF="286"/>
Oppression of an unjust Modesty. I must acknow∣ledge I have seen many of the Temper mentioned by this Correspondent, and own, Wine may very allowably be used in a Degree above the Supply of meer Necessity by such as labour under Melan∣choly, or are Tongue-ty'd by Modesty. It is cer∣tainly a very agreeable Change, when we see a Glass raise a lifeless Conversation into all the Pleasures of Wit and good Humour. But when <HI>Caska</HI> adds to his natural Impudence the Fluster of a Bottle, that which Fools called Fire when he was sober, all Men abhor as Outrage when he is drunk. Thus he that in the Morning was only saucy, is in the Evening tumultuous. It makes one sick to hear one of these Fellows say, They love a Friend and a Bottle. Noisy Mirth has something too rustick in it to be considered with∣out Terror by Men of Politeness: But while the Discourse improves in a well chosen Company, from the Addition of Spirits which flow from moderate Cups, it must be acknowledged, that Leisure Time cannot be more agreeably, or per∣haps more usefully employed than at such Meet∣ings: But there is a certain Prudence in this and all other Circumstances which makes Right or Wrong in the Conduct of ordinary Life. Sir <HI>Jeof∣frey Wildacre</HI> has nothing so much at Heart as that his Son should know the World betimes: For this End he introduces him among the Sots of his own Age, where the Boy learns to laugh at his Father from the Familiarity with which he sees him treated by his Equals. This the old Fellow calls Living well with his Heir, and teaching him to be too much his Friend to be impatient for his Estate. But for the more exact Regulation of Society in this and other Matters, I shall publish Tables of the Characters and Relations among Men, and by them instruct the Town in making Sets and Companies for a Bottle. This Humour
<PB N="277" REF="287"/>
of Sir <HI>Jeoffrey</HI> shall be taken Notice of in the first Place; for there is, methinks, a Sort of Incest in Drunkenness, and Sons are not to behold Fathers stripped of all Reverence.</P>
<P>It is shocking in Nature for the Young, to see those whom they should have an Awe for in Cir∣cumstances of Contempt. I shall therefore utter∣ly forbid, that those in whom Nature should ad∣monish to avoid too gross Familiarities, shall be received in Parties of Pleasure where there is the least Danger of Excess. I should run through the whole Doctrine of Drinking, but that my Thoughts are at present too much employed in the Model∣ling <HI>my Court of Honour;</HI> and altering the Seats, Benches, Bar, and Canopy from that of the Court wherein I last Winter sate upon Causes of less Mo∣ment. By the Way I shall take an Opportunity to examine, what Method is to be taken to make Joiners and other Artificers get out of a House they have once entered, not forgetting to tie them under proper Regulations. It is for Want of such Rules, that I have a Day or two longer than I expected been tormented and deafened with Ham∣mers, insomuch that I neither can pursue this Discourse, or answer the following and many other Letters of the highest Importance.</P>

<Q>Die Lunae vicesimo Novembris, Hora nona Ante∣meridiana.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Court being sat, an Oath prepared by the Censor was administred to the Assistants on his Right Hand, who were all sworn upon their Honour. The Women on his Left Hand took the same Oath upon their Reputation. Twelve Gentlemen of the Horse-Guards were im∣pannelled, having unanimously chosen Mr. <HI>Alexan∣der Truncheon,</HI> who is their Right-Hand Man in the Troop, for their Foreman in the Jury. Mr. <HI>Truncheon</HI> immediately drew his Sword, and holding it with the Point towards his own Body, presented it to the Censor. Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> recei∣ved it, and after having surveyed the Breadth of the Blade, and Sharpness of the Point, with more
<PB N="279" REF="289"/>
than ordinary Attention, returned it to the Fore∣man in a very graceful Manner. The rest of the Jury, upon the Delivery of the Sword to their Foreman, drew all of them together as one Man, and saluted the Bench with such an Air, as signi∣fied the most resigned Submission to those who commanded them, and the greatest Magnanimity to execute what they should command.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> after having received the Com∣pliments on his Right Hand, cast his Eye upon the Left, where the whole Female Jury paid their Respects by a low Courtesie, and by laying their Hands upon their Mouths. Their Forewoman was a professed <HI>Platonist,</HI> that had spent much of her Time in exhorting the Sex to set a just Value upon their Persons, and to make the Men know them∣selves.</P>
<P>There followed a profound Silence, when at length, after some Recollection, the Censor, who continued hitherto uncovered, put on his Hat with great Dignity; and after having composed the Brims of it in a Manner suitable to the Gravi∣ty of his Character, he gave the following Charge, which was received with Silence and Attention, that being the only Applause which he admits of, or is ever given in his Presence.</P>
<Q><P>The Nature of my Office, and the Solemnity of this Occasion, requiring that I should open my First Session with a Speech, I shall cast what I have to say under Two principal Heads.</P>
<P>Under the First, I shall endeavour to show the Necessity and Usefulness of this new-erected Court; and under the Second, I shall give a Word of Advice and Instruction to every constituent Part of it.</P>
<P>As for the First, it is well observed by <HI>Phaedrus</HI> an Heathen Poet,
<Q><PB N="280" REF="290"/>
<L>Nisi utile est quod facimus, frustra est Gloria.</L></Q>
Which is the same, Ladies, as if I should say, <HI>It would be of no Reputation for me to be President of a Court which is of no Benefit to the Publick.</HI> Now the Advantages that may arise to the Weal-Publick from this Institution will more plainly appear, if we consider what it suffers for the Want of it. Are not our Streets daily filled with wild Pieces of Justice and random Penalties? Are not Crimes undetermined, and Reparations disproportioned? How often have we seen the Lye punished by Death, and the Lyar himself deciding his own Cause? nay, not only acting the Judge, but the Excutioner? Have we not known a Box on the Ear more se∣verely accounted for than Manslaughter? In these Extrajudicial Proceedings of Mankind, an unmannerly Jest is frequently as Capital as a premeditated Murder.</P>
<P>But the most pernicious Circumstance in this Case is, that the Man who suffers the Injury must put himself upon the same Foot of Danger with him that gave it, before he can have his just Revenge; so that the Punishment is altoge∣ther accidental, and may fall as well upon the Innocent as the Guilty.</P>
<P>I shall only mention a Case which happens frequently among the more polite Nations of the World, and which I the rather mention, be∣cause both Sexes are concerned in it, and which therefore you Gentlemen and you Ladies of the Jury will the rather take Notice of; I mean that great and known Case of Cuckoldom. Supposing the Person who has suffered Insults in his dearer and better-Half; supposing, I say, this Person should resent the Injuries done to his tender Wife, What is the Reparation he may expect? Why, to be used worse than his poor Lady, run through the Body, and left
<PB N="281" REF="291"/>
Breathless upon the Bed of Honour. What then will you on my Right Hand say must the Man do that is affronted? Must our Sides be elbow∣ed, our Shins broken? Must the Wall, or per∣haps our Mistress, be taken from us? May a Man knit his Forhead into a Frown, toss up his Arm, on pish at what we say, and must the Villain live after it? Is there no Redress for injured Honour? Yes, Gentlemen, that is the Design of the Judicature we have here esta∣blished.</P>
<P>A Court of Conscience, we very well know, was first instituted for the determining of se∣veral Points of Property that were too little and trivial for the Cognizance of higher Courts of Justice. In the same Manner, our Court of Ho∣nour is appointed for the Examination of seve∣ral Niceties and Punctilio's that do not pass for Wrongs in the Eye of our common Laws. But notwithstanding no Legislators of any Nation have taken into Consideration these little Cir∣cumstances, they are such as often lead to Crimes big enough for their Inspection, though they come before them too late for their Re∣dress.</P>
<P>Besides, I appeal to you, Ladies, <HI>[Here Mr.</HI> Bick∣erstaff <HI>turned to his Left Hand]</HI> if these are not the little Stings and Thorns in Life that make it more uneasy than its most substantial Evils? Confess ingenuously, Did you never lose a Morn∣ning's Devotions because you could not offer them up from the highest Place of the Pew? Have you not been in Pain, even at a Ball, because ano∣ther has been taken out to dance before you? Do you love any of your Friends so much as those that are below you? Or have you any Favourites that walk on your Right Hand? You have answered me in your Looks, I ask no more.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="292"/>
I come now to the Second Part of my Dis∣course, which obliges me to address my self in particular to the respective Members of the Court, in which I shall be very brief.</P>
<P>As for you, Gentlemen and Ladies my Assistants and Grand Juries, I have made Choice of you on my Right Hand, because I know you very jealous of your Honour; and you on my Left, because I know you very much concerned for the Reputation of others; for which Rea∣son I expect great Exactness and Impartiality in your Verdicts and Judgments.</P>
<P>I must in the next Place address my self to you, Gentlemen of the Council: You all know, that I have not chosen you for your Knowledge in the litigious Parts of the Law, but because you have all of you formerly fought Duels, of which I have Reason to think you have repent∣ed, as being now settled in the peaceable State of Benchers. My Advice to you is, only that in your Pleadings you are short and expressive: To which End you are to banish out of your Dis∣courses all synonymous Terms, and unnecessary Multiplications of Verbs and Nouns. I do more∣over forbid you the Use of the Words <HI>also</HI> and <HI>likewise;</HI> and must further declare, That if I catch any one among you, upon any Pretence whatsoever, using the Particle <HI>or,</HI> I shall inces∣santly order him to be stripped of his Gown, and thrown over the Bar.</P></Q>

<P>THere are no Books which I more delight in than in Travels, especially those that describe remote Countries, and give the Writer an Oppor∣tunity of showing his Parts without incurring any Danger of being examined or contradicted. Among all the Authors of this Kind, our re∣nowned Countryman Sir <HI>John Mandeville</HI> has di∣stinguished himself, by the Copiousness of his Invention, and Greatness of his Genius. The Second to Sir <HI>John</HI> I take to have been <HI>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto,</HI> a Person of infinite Adventure, and unbounded Imagination. One reads the Voyages of these Two great Wits with as much Astonishment as the Travels of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in <HI>Homer,</HI> or of the <HI>Red Cross</HI> Knight in <HI>Spencer.</HI> All is En∣chanted Ground, and Fairy Land.</P>
<P>I have got into my Hands by great Chance se∣veral Manuscripts of these Two eminent Authors, which are filled with greater Wonders than any of those they have communicated to the Publick; and indeed, were they not so well attested, would appear altogether improbable. I am apt to think, the ingenious Authors did not publish them with the rest of their Works, lest they should pass for Fictions and Fables: A Caution not unnecessary, when the Reputation of their Veracity was not yet established in the World. But as this Reason has now no further Weight.
<PB N="284" REF="294"/>
I shall make the Publick a Present of these curious Pieces at such Times as I shall find my self un∣provided with other Subjects.</P>
<P>The present Paper I intend to fill with an Ex∣tract of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Journal, in which that learned and worthy Knight gives an Account of the Freezing and Thawing of several short Speeches which he made in the Territories of <HI>Nova Zem∣bla.</HI> I need not inform my Reader, that the Au∣thor of <HI>Hudibras</HI> alludes to this strange Quality in that cold Climate, when, speaking of abstra∣cted Notions cloathed in a visible Shape, he adds that apt Simile,</P>
<Q><L>Like Words congeal'd in Northern Air.</L></Q>
<P>Not to keep my Reader any longer in Suspence, the Relation put into modern Language is as fol∣lows:</P>
<P>We were separated by a Storm in the Latitude of 73, insomuch that only the Ship which I was in, with a <HI>Dutch</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Vessel, got safe into a Creek of <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI> We landed, in order to resit our Vessels, and store our selves with Provisions. The Crew of each Vessel made themselves a Cabbin of Turf and Wood, at some Distance from each other, to fence themselves a∣gainst the Inclemencies of the Weather, which was severe beyond Imagination. We soon ob∣served, that in talking to one another we lost se∣veral of our Words, and could not hear one ano∣ther at above Two Yards Distance, and that too when we sat very near the Fire. After much Perplexity, I found that our Words froze in the Air before they could reach the Ears of the Per∣son to whom they were spoken. I was soon con∣firmed in this Conjecture, when, upon the Increase of the Cold, the whole Company grew dumb, or rather deaf; for every Man was sensible, as we afterwards found, that he spoke as well as ever; but the Sounds no sooner took Air, than
<PB N="285" REF="295"/>
they were condensed and lost. It was now a miserable Spectacle to see us nodding and gaping at one another, every Man talking, and no Man heard. One might observe a Seaman, that could hail a Ship at a League distance, beckoning with his Hands, straining his Lungs, and tearing his Throat, but all in vain.</P>
<Q><L>— Nec vox, nec Verba, sequuntur.</L></Q>
<P>We continued here Three Weeks in this dismal Plight. At length, upon a Turn of Wind, the Air about us began to thaw. Our Cabbin was immediately filled with a dry clattering Sound, which I afterwards found to be the Crackling of Consonants that broke above our Heads, and were often mixed with a gentle Hissing, which I imputed to the Letter <HI>S,</HI> that occurs so fre∣quently in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue. I soon after felt a Breeze of Whispers rushing by my Ear; for those being of a soft and gentle Substance, im∣mediately liquefied in the warm Wind that blew across our Cabbin. These were soon followed by Syllables and short Words, and at length by entire Sentences, that melted sooner or later, as they were more or less congealed; so that we now heard every Thing that had been <HI>spoken</HI> du∣ring the whole Three Weeks that we had been <HI>silent,</HI> if I may use that Expression. It was now very early in the Morning, and yet, to my Sur∣prize, I heard some Body say, <HI>Sir</HI> John, <HI>it is Mid∣night, and Time for the Ship's Crew to go to Bed.</HI> This I knew to be the Pilot's Voice, and upon re∣collecting my self, I concluded that he had spo∣ken these Words to me some Days before, though I could not hear them before the present Thaw. My Reader will easily imagine how the whole Crew was amazed, to hear every Man talking, and see no Man opening his Mouth. In the Midst of this great Surprize we were all in, we heard a Volley of Oaths and Curses, lasting for
<PB N="286" REF="296"/>
a long while, and uttered in a very hoarse Voice, which I knew belonged to the Boatswain, who was a very cholerick Fellow, and had taken his Opportunity of Cursing and Swearing at me when he thought I could not hear him; for I had several Times given him the Strappado on that Account, as I did not fail to repeat it for these his pious Soliloquies when I got him on Ship∣board.</P>
<P>I must not omit the Names of several Beauties in <HI>Wapping,</HI> which were heard every now and then, in the Midst of a long Sigh that accompa∣nied them; as, Dear <HI>Kate!</HI> Pretty Mrs. <HI>Peggy!</HI> When shall I see my <HI>Sue</HI> again? This betray'd several Amours which had been concealed till that Time, and furnished us with a great deal of Mirth in our Return to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When this Confusion of Voices was pretty well over, though I was afraid to offer at Speaking, as fearing I should not be heard, I proposed a Visit to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Cabbin, which lay about a Mile further up into the Country. My Crew were extreamly rejoiced to find they had again recovered their Hearing, though every Man ut∣tered his Voice with the same Apprehensions that I had done!</P>
<Q><L>— Et timide Verba intermissa retentat.</L></Q>
<P>At about half a Mile's Distance from our Cab∣bin, we heard the Groanings of a Bear, which at first startled us; but upon Enquiry we were in∣formed by some of our Company, that he was dead, and now lay in Salt, having been killed upon that very Spot about a Fortnight before, in the Time of the Frost. Not far from the same Place we were likewise entertained with some posthumous Snarls and Barkings of a Fox.</P>
<P>We at length arrived at the little <HI>Dutch</HI> Settle∣ment, and upon entering the Room, found it filled
<PB N="287" REF="297"/>
with Sighs that smelt of Brandy, and several o∣ther unsavourly Sounds that were altogether in∣articulate. My Valet, who was an <HI>Irishman,</HI> fell into so great a Rage at what he heard, that he drew his Sword; but not knowing where to lay the Blame, he put it up again. We were stun∣ned with these confused Noises, but did not hear a single Word till about half an Hour after; which I ascribed to the harsh and obdurate Sounds of that Language, which wanted more Time than ours to melt and become audible.</P>
<P>After having here met with a very hearty Wel∣come, we went to the <HI>French</HI> Cabbin, who, to make Amends for their Three Weeks Silence, were Talking and Disputing with greater Rapi∣dity and Confusion than ever I heard in an As∣sembly even of that Nation. Their Language as I found, upon the first Giving of the Weather, sell asunder and dissolved. I was here convinced of an Error into which I had before fallen; for I fancied, that for the Freezing of the Sound, it was necessary for it to be wrapped up, and, as it were, preserved in Breath; but I found my Mi∣stake, when I heard the Sound of a Kit playing a Minuet over our Heads. I asked the Occasion of it; upon which one of the Company told me, that it would play there above a Week longer if the Thaw continued; for, says he, finding our selves bereft of Speech, we prevailed upon one of the Company, who had this Musical Instru∣ment about him, to play to us from Morning to Night; all which Time we employed in Dan∣cing, in order to dissipate our Chagrin, &amp; <HI>tuer le Temps.</HI></P>
<P>Here Sir <HI>John</HI> gives very good Philosophical Reasons why the Kit could be heard during the Frost; but as they are something Prolix, I pass them over in Silence, and shall only observe, that the honourable Author seems, by his Quo∣tations, to have been well versed in the ancient
<PB N="288" REF="298"/>
Poets, which perhaps raised his Fancy above th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ordinary Pitch of Historians, and very muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contributed to the Embellishment of his Wri¦ings.</P>

<HEAD>To the Censor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM at present under very great Difficulties, which it is not in the Power of any one, be∣sides your self, to redress. Whether or no you shall think it a proper Case to come before your <HI>Court of Honour,</HI> I cannot tell; but thus it is: I am Chaplain to an honourable Family, very regular at the Hours of Devotion, and I hope of an unblameable Life; but for not offer∣ing to rise at Second Course, I found my Patron and his Lady very sullen and out of Humour, though at first I did not know the Reason of it. At length, when I happened to help my self to a Jelly, the Lady of the House, other∣wise a devout Woman, told me, That it did not become a Man of my Cloth to delight in such frivolous Food: But as I still continued to sit out the last Course, I was Yesterday infor∣med by the Butler, that his Lordship had no further Occasion for my Service. All which
<PB N="289" REF="299"/>
is humbly submitted to your Consideration, by,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your most humble Servant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The Case of this Gentleman deserves Pity, e∣specially if he loves Sweetmeats, to which, if I may guess by his Letter, he is no Enemy. In the mean Time, I have often wondered at the Indecency of discarding the holiest Man from the Table as soon as the most delicious Parts of the Entertainment are served up, and could never conceive a Reason for so absurd a Custom. Is it because a liquorish Palate, or a sweet Tooth (as they call it) is not consistent with the Sanctity of his Character? This is but a trifling Pretence. No Man of the most rigid Virtue gives Offence by any Excesses in Plumb-Pudding or Plumb-Por∣ridge, and that, because they are the first Parts of the Dinner. Is there any Thing that tends to Incitation in Sweetmeats more than in ordi∣nary Dishes? Certainly not. Sugar-Plumbs are a very innocent Diet, and Conserves of a much colder Nature than your common Pickles. I have sometimes thought, that the Ceremony of the Chaplain's flying away from the Dessert was Typical and Figurative, to mark out to the Com∣pany how they ought to retire from all the lus∣cious Baits of Temptation, and deny their Appe∣tites the Gratifications that are most pleasing to them; or at least to signify, that we ought to stint our selves in our most lawful Satisfactions, and not make our Pleasure, but our Support, the End of Eating: But most certainly, if such a Lesson of Temperance had been necessary at a Table, our Clergy would have recommended it to all the Lay-Masters of Families, and not have disturbed other Men's Tables with such unseason∣able Examples of Abstinence. The Original

therefore of this barbarous Custom, I take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been meerly accidental.

This by Degre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grew into a Duty, till at length, as the Fashio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> improved, the good Man found himself cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the third Part of the Entertainment; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> if the Arrogance of the Patron goes on, it is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> impossible but, in the next Generation, he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> see himself reduced to the Tythe, or Tenth Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of the Table; a sufficient Caution not to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> with any Privilege we are once possessed of. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was usual for the Priest in old Times to feast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦on the Sacrifice, nay the Honey-Cake, while th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hungry Laity looked upon him with great Devo¦tion, or as the late Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> describes it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a very lively Manner:</P>
<Q><L>And whiie the Priest did eat, the People stared.</L></Q>
<P>At present the Custom is inverted; the Lai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> feast, while the Priest stands by as an humbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spectator.

I would fain ask these stif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neck'd Patrons, Whether they would not take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ill of a Chaplain that, in his Grace after Meat, should return Thanks for the whole Entertain∣ment, with an Exception to the Dessert? And ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I cannot but think, that in such a Proceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would but deal with them as they deserved<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> What would a Roman Catholick Priest think<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who is always helped first, and placed next th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ladies, should he see a Clergyman giving hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Company the Slip at the first Appearance of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tarts or Sweetmeats? Would not he believ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he had the same Antipathy to a Candie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Orange, or a Piece of Puff-Past, as some have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="291" REF="301"/>
a <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheese, or a Breast of Mutton? Yet to so ridiculous a Height is this foolish Custom grown, that even the <HI>Christmas</HI> Pye, which in its very Nature is a kind of consecrated Cate, and a Badge of Distinction, is often forbidden to the Druid of the Family. Strange! that a Sirloin of Beef, whether boiled or roasted, when entire, is exposed to his utmost Depredations and Incisions; but if minced into small Pieces, and tossed up with Plumbs and Sugar, changes its Property, and, forsooth, is Meat for his Ma∣ster.</P>
<P>In this Case I know not which to censure, the Patron or the Chaplain, the Insolence of Power, or the Abjectness of Dependance. For my own Part, I have often blushed to see a Gentleman, whom I knew to have much more Wit and Lear∣ning than my self, and who was bred up with me at the University upon the same Foot of a liberal Education, treated in such an ignominious Manner, and sunk beneath those of his own Rank, by reason of that Character which ought to bring him Honour. This deters Men of ge∣nerous Minds from placing themselves in such a Station of Life, and by that Means frequently excludes Persons of Quality from the improving and agreeable Conversation of a learned and ob∣sequious Friend.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Oldham</HI> lets us know, That he was affright∣ed from the Thought of such an Employment, by the scandalous Sort of Treatment which often accompanies it.</P>

<HEAD>The Proceedings of the <HI>Court of Honour,</HI> held in <HI>Sheer-Lane</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> the 20th of <HI>Novem¦ber,</HI> 1710. before <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Censor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>PEter Plumb,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Merchant, was in∣dicted by the Honourable Mr. <HI>Thomas Gules,</HI> of <HI>Gule-Hall</HI> in the Country of <HI>Salop,</HI> for that the said <HI>Peter Plumb</HI> did in <HI>Lombard-street, London,</HI> between the Hours of Two and Three in the Afternoon, meet the said Mr. <HI>Thomas Gules,</HI> and after a short Salutation, put on his Hat, Value Five-Pence, while the Honourable Mr. <HI>Gules</HI> stood bare-headed for the Space of Two Seconds. It was further urged against the Criminal, That during his Discourse with the Prosecutor, he fe∣loniously stole the Wall of him, having clapped his Back against it in such a Manner that it was impossible for Mr. <HI>Gules</HI> to recover it again at his taking Leave of him. The Prosecutor alledged, That he was the Cadet of a very ancient Family; and that according to the Principles of all the younger Brothers of the said Family, he had ne∣ver sullied himself with Business, but had chosen rather to starve like a Man of Honour, than do any Thing beneath his Quality. He produced several Witnesses, that he had never employed himself beyond the Twisting of a Whip, or the Making of a Pair of Nut-Crackers, in which he
<PB N="294" REF="304"/>
only worked for his Diversion, in order to mae a Present now and then to his Friends. The Pri∣soner being asked what he could say for himself, cast several Reflections upon the Honourable Mr. <HI>Gules;</HI> as, That he was not worth a Groat; That no Body in the City would trust him for a Halspenny; That he owed him Money, which he had promised to pay him several Times, but ne∣ver kept his Word: And in short, That he was an idle, beggarly Fellow, and of no Use to the Publick. This Sort of Language was very se∣verely reprimanded by the Censor, who told the Criminal, That he spoke in Contempt of the Court, and that he should be proceeded against for Contumacy, if he did not change his Style. The Prisoner therefore desired to be heard by his Council, who urged in his Defence, That he put on his Hat through Ignorance, and took the Wall by Accident. They likewise produced se∣veral Witnesses, That he made several Motions with his Hat in his Hand, which are generally understood as an Invitation to the Person we talk with to be covered; and that the Gentleman not taking the Hint, he was forced to put on his Hat, as being troubled with a Cold. There was likewise an <HI>Irish</HI> Man who deposed, That he had heard him cough Three and twenty times that Morning. And as for the Wall, it was alledged That he had taken it inadvertently, to save him∣self from a Shower of Rain which was then fal∣ling. The Censor having consulted the Men of Honour who sat at his Right Hand on the Bench, found they were all of Opinion, That the De∣fence made by the Prisoner's Council did rather aggravate than extenuate his Crime; That the Motions and Intimations of the Hat were a To∣ken of Superiority in Conversation, and therefore not to be used by the Criminal to a Man of the Prosecutor's Quality, who was likewise vested with a double Title to the Wall at the Time of

The Evidence being very full and clear, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ry, without going out of Court, declared their Opinion unanimously by the Mouth of their Fore∣man, That the Prosecutor was bound in Honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o make the Sun shine through the Criminal, or, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s they afterwards explained themselves, to whip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im through the Lungs.</P>
<P>The Censor knitting his Brows into a Frown, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd looking very sternly upon the Jury, after a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle Pause, gave them to know, That this Court was erected for the finding out of Penalties suita∣ble to Offences, and to restrain the Outrages of private Justice; and that he expected they should moderate their Verdict. The Jury therefore re∣tired, and being willing to comply with the Ad∣vices of the Censor, after an Hour's Consulta∣tion, declared their Opinion as follows:</P>
<P>That in Consideration this was <HI>Peter Plumb</HI>'s first Offence, and that there did not appear any <HI>Malice prepense</HI> in it, as also that he lived in good Reputation among his Neighbours, and that his taking the Wall was only <HI>se defendendo,</HI> the Pro∣secutor should let him escape with Life, and content himself with the Slitting of his Nose, and the Cutting off both his Ears. Mr. <HI>Bicker∣staff</HI> smiling upon the Court, told them, That he thought the Punishment, even under its present Mitigation, too severe; and that such Penalties might be of ill Consequence in a Trading Na∣tion. He therefore pronounced Sentence against the Criminal in the following Manner: That his Hat, which was the Instrument of Offence, should be forfeited to the Court; That the Criminal should go to the Warehouse from whence he came, and thence, as Occasion should require, proceed to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> or <HI>Garraway</HI>'s Coffee-house, in what Manner he pleased; but that neither he nor any of the Family of the

<P><HI>Dathan,</HI> a Peddling <HI>Jew,</HI> and <HI>T. R—,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Welshman,</HI> were indicted by the Keeper of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Alehouse in <HI>Westminster,</HI> for breaking the Peac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and two Earthen Mugs, in a Dispute about the Antiquity of their Families, to the great Detri∣ment of the House, and Disturbance of the whole Neighbourhood. <HI>Dathan</HI> said for himself, that he was provoked to it by the <HI>Welshman,</HI> who pretended, that the <HI>Welsh</HI> were an ancienter People than the <HI>Jews;</HI> whereas, says he, I can shew by this Genealogy in my Hand, that I am the Son of <HI>Mesheck,</HI> that was the Son of <HI>Naboth,</HI> that was the Son of <HI>Shalem,</HI> that was the Son of — The <HI>Welshman</HI> here interrupted him, and told him, That he could produce Shennalo∣gy as well as himself; for that he was <HI>John ap Rice, ap Shenkin, ap Shones.</HI> He then turned himself to the Censor, and told him in the same broken Accent, and with much Warmth, That the <HI>Jew</HI> would needs uphold, that King <HI>Cadwalla∣der</HI> was younger than <HI>Issachar.</HI> Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> seemed very much inclined to give Sentence a∣gainst <HI>Dathan,</HI> as being a <HI>Jew;</HI> but finding Rea∣sons, by some Expressions which the <HI>Welshman</HI> let fall in asserting the Antiquity of his Family, to suspect that the said <HI>Welshman</HI> was a <HI>Prae-Ada∣mite,</HI> he suffered the Jury to go out, without any previous Admonition. After some Time they returned, and gave their Verdict, That it appearing the Persons at the Bar did neither of them wear a Sword, and that consequently they had no Right to quarrel upon a Point of Ho∣nour; to prevent such frivolous Appeals for the future, they should both of them be tossed in the same Blanket, and there adjust the Superio∣rity
<PB N="297" REF="307"/>
as they could agree it between themselves. The Censor confirmed the Verdict.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Newman</HI> was indicted by Major <HI>Punto,</HI> for having used the Words, <HI>Perhaps it may be so,</HI> in a Dispute with the said Major. The Major urged, That the Word, <HI>Perhaps,</HI> was questioning his Veracity, and that it was an indirect Manner of giving him the Lye. <HI>Richard Newman</HI> had nothing more to say for himself, than that he in∣tended no such Thing, and threw himself upon the Mercy of the Court. The Jury brought in their Verdict Special.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> stood up, and after having cast his Eyes over the whole Assembly, hem'd thrice. He then acquainted them, That he had laid down a Rule to himself, which he was resolved never to depart from, and which, as he conceived, would very much conduce to the shortening the Business of the Court; I mean, says he, never to allow of the Lye being given by Construction, Implication, or Induction, but by the sole Use of the Word it self. He then proceeded to show the great Mischiefs that had arisen to the <HI>English</HI> Nation from that pernicious Monosyllable; That it had bred the most fatal Quarrels between the dearest Friends; That it had frequently thin'd the Guards, and made great Havock in the Ar∣my; That it had sometimes weaken'd the City Trained Bands; and, in a Word, had destroved many of the bravest Men in the Isle of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> For the Prevention of which Evils for the future, he instructed the Jury to <HI>present</HI> the Word it self as a Nusance in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue; and further promised them, That he would, up∣on such their Presentment, publish an Edict of the Court for the entire Banishment and Exclu∣sion of it out of the Discourses and Conversation of all civil Societies.</P>

<P>EVery Nation is distinguished by Productions that are peculiar to it. <HI>Great Britain</HI> is par∣ticularly fruitful in Religions, that shoot up and flourish in this Climate more than in any other. We are so famous Abroad for our great Variety of Sects and Opinions, that an ingenious Friend of mine, who is lately returned from his Tra∣vels, assures me, there is a Show at this Time <HI>carried</HI> up and down in <HI>Germany,</HI> which repre∣sents all the Religions of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in Wax∣work. Notwithstanding that the Pliancy of the Matter in which the Images are wrought makes it capable of being moulded into all Shapes and Figures, my Friend tells me, that he did not think it possible for it to be twisted and tortured into so many skrew'd Faces and wry Features as appeared in several of the Figures that composed the Show. I was indeed so pleased with the De∣sign of the <HI>German</HI> Artist, that I begged my Friend to give me an Account of it in all its Par∣ticulars, which he did after the following Man∣ner.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="309"/>
I have often, says he, been present at a Show of Elephants, Camels, Dromedaries, and other strange Creatures, but I never saw so great an Assembly of Spectators as were met together at the Opening of this great Piece of Wax-work. We were all placed in a large Hall, according to the Price that we had paid for our Seats: The Curtain that hung before the Show was made by a Master of Tapestry, who had woven it in the Figure of a monstrous <HI>Hydra</HI> that had several Heads, which brandished out their Tongues, and seemed to hiss at each other. Some of these Heads were large and entire; and where any of them had been lopped away, there sprouted up several in the Room of them; insomuch that for one Head cut off, a Man might see Ten, Twen∣ty, or an Hundred, of a smaller Size, creeping through the Wound. In short, the whole Picture was nothing but Confusion and Bloodshed. On a sudden, says my Friend, I was startled with a Flourish of many Musical Instruments that I had never heard before, which was followed by a short Tune, (if it might be so called) wholly made up of Jars and Discords. Among the rest, there was an Organ, a Bagpipe, a Groaning-Board, a Stentorophonick-Trumpet, with several Wind Instruments of a most disagreeable Sound, which I do not so much as know the Name of. After a short Flourish, the Curtain was drawn up, and we were presented with the most extraordinary Assembly of Figures that ever entered into a Man's Imagination. The Design of the Work∣man was so well expressed in the dumb Show before us, that it was not hard for an <HI>English∣man</HI> to comprehend the Meaning of it.</P>
<P>The principal Figures were placed in a Row, consisting of Seven Persons. The middle Figure, which immediately attracted the Eyes of the whole Company, and was much bigger than the rest, was formed like a Matron, dressed in the Habit
<PB N="300" REF="310"/>
of an elderly Woman of Quality in Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI>'s Days. The most remarkable Parts of her Dress, was the Beaver with the Steeple Crown, the Scarf that was darker than Sable, and the Lawn Apron that was whiter than Er∣min. Her Gown was of the richest black Vel∣vet, and just upon her Heart studded with large Diamonds of an inestimable Value, disposed in the Form of a Cross. She bore an inexpressible Chearfulness and Dignity in her Aspect; and though she seemed in Years, appeared with so much Spirit and Vivacity, as gave her at the same Time an Air of old Age and Immortality. I found my Heart touched with so much Love and Reverence at the Sight of her, that the Tears ran down my Face as I looked upon her; and still the more I looked upon her, the more my Heart was melted with the Sentiments of Filial Tenderness and Duty. I discovered every Mo∣ment something so charming in this Figure, that I could scarce take my Eyes off it. On its Right Hand there sat the Figure of a Woman so covered with Ornaments, that her Face, her Body, and her Hands, were almost entirely hid under them. The little you could see of her Face was painted; and what I thought very odd, had something in it like artificial Wrinkles; but I was the less surprised at it, when I saw upon her Forehead an old-fashioned Tower of grey Hairs. Her Head-Dress rose very high by Three several Stories or Degrees; her Garments had a Thousand Colours in them, and were embroi∣dered with Crosses in Gold, Silver and Silk: She had nothing on, so much as a Glove or a Slipper, which was not marked with this Figure; nay, so superstitiously fond did she appear of it, that she sat cross-legged. I was quickly sick of this tawdry Composition of Ribands, Silks and Jewels, and therefore cast my Eye on a Dame which was just the Reverse of it. I need not tell
<PB N="301" REF="311"/>
my Reader, that the Lady before described was <HI>Popery,</HI> or that she I am now going to describe is <HI>Presbytery.</HI> She sat on the Left Hand of the ve∣nerable Matron, and so much resembled her in the Features of her Countenance, that she seemed her Sister; but at the same Time that one obser∣ved a Likness in her Beauty, one could not but take Notice, that there was something in it sickly and splenatick. Her Face had enough to discover the Relation, but it was drawn up into a peevish Figure, sowred with Discontent, and overcast with Melancholy. She seemed offended at the Matron for the Shape of her Hat, as too much resembling the triple Coronet of the Person who sat by her. One might see likewise, that she dissented from the white Apron and the Cross; for which Reasons she had made her self a plain, homely Dowdy, and turned her Face towards the Sectaries that sat on her Left Hand, as being a∣fraid of looking upon the Matron, lest she should see the Harlot by her.</P>
<P>On the Right Hand of <HI>Popery</HI> sat <HI>Judaism,</HI> re∣presented by an old Man embroidered with Phy∣lacteries, and distinguished by many Typical Fi∣gures, which I had not Skill enough to unriddle. He was placed among the Rubbish of a Temple; but instead of weeping over it, (which I should have expected from him) he was counting out a Bag of Money upon the Ruins of it.</P>
<P>On his Right Hand was <HI>Deism,</HI> or <HI>Natural Re∣ligion.</HI> This was a Figure of an half-naked auk∣ward Country Wench, who with proper Orna∣ments and Education would have made an agree∣able and beautiful Appearance; but for Want of those Advantages, was such a Spectacle, as a Man would blush to look upon.</P>
<P>I have now, continued my Friend, given you an Account of those who were placed on the Right Hand of the Matron, and who, according to the Order in which they sat, were <HI>Deism, Ju∣daism,</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="312"/>
and <HI>Popery.</HI> On the Left Hand, as I told you, appeared <HI>Presbytery.</HI> The next to her was a Figure which somewhat puzzled me: It was that of a Man looking, with Horror in his Eyes, upon a Silver Bason filled with Water. Observing something in his Countenance that looked like Lunacy, I fancied at first that he was to express that kind of Distraction which the Physicians call the <HI>Hydro-Phobia;</HI> but considering what the Intention of the Show was, I immediately re∣collected my self, and concluded it to be <HI>Ana∣baptism.</HI></P>
<P>The next Figure was a Man that sat under a most profound Composure of Mind: He wore an Hat whose Brims were exactly parallel with the Horizon: His Garment had neither Sleeve nor Skirt, nor so much as a superfluous Button. What they called his Cravat, was a little Piece of white Linen quilled with great Exactness, and hanging below his Chin about two Inches. See∣ing a Book in his Hand, I asked our Artist what it was, who told me it was the <HI>Quakers</HI> Religion; upon which I desired a Sight of it. Upon Peru∣sal, I found it to be nothing but a new-fashioned Grammar, or an Art of abridging ordinary Dis∣course. The Nouns were reduced to a very small Number, as the <HI>Light, Friend, Babylon.</HI> The principal of his Pronouns was <HI>Thou;</HI> and as for You, Ye, and Yours, I found they were not looked upon as Parts of Speech in this Grammar. All the Verbs wanted the Second Person Plural; the Participles ended all in <HI>ing</HI> or <HI>ed,</HI> which were marked with a particular Accent. There were no Adverbs besides <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Nay.</HI> The same Thrift was observed in the Prepositions. The Con∣junctions were only <HI>Hem!</HI> and <HI>Ha!</HI> and the In∣terjections brought under the Three Heads of Sighing, Sobbing, and Groaning.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="313"/>
There was at the End of the Grammar a little Nomenclature, call'd, <HI>The Christian Man's Voca∣bulary,</HI> which gave new Appellations, or (if you will) Christian Names to almost every Thing in Life. I replaced the Book in the Hand of the Fi∣gure, not without admiring the Simplicity of its Garb, Speech, and Behaviour.</P>
<P>Just opposite to this Row of Religions, there was a Statue dressed in a Fool's Coat, with a Cap of Bells upon his Head, laughing and pointing at the Figures that stood before him. This Ideot is supposed to say in his Heart what <HI>David</HI>'s Fool did some Thousands of Years ago, and was therefore designed as a proper Representative of those among us who are called Atheists and In∣fidels by others, and Free-Thinkers by them∣selves.</P>
<P>There were many other Groupes of Figures which I did not know the Meaning of; but see∣ing a Collection of both Sexes turning their Backs upon the Company, and laying their Heads very close together, I enquired after their Religion, and found that they called themselves the <HI>Philo∣delphians,</HI> or the Family of Love.</P>
<P>In the opposite Corner there sat another little Congregation of strange Figures, opening their Mouths as wide as they could gape, and distin∣guished by the Title of the <HI>Sweet Singers of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>I must not omit, that in this Assembly of Wax there were several Pieces that moved by Clock∣work, and gave great Satisfaction to the Specta∣tors. Behind the Matron there stood one of these Figures, and behind <HI>Popery</HI> another, which, as the Artist told us, were each of them the Genius of the Person they attended. That behind <HI>Popery</HI> represented <HI>Persecution,</HI> and the other <HI>Moderation.</HI> The first of these moved by secret Springs to∣wards a great Heap of dead Bodies that lay piled upon one another at a considerable Distance be∣hind the principal Figures. There were written
<PB N="304" REF="314"/>
on the Foreheads of these dead Men several ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Words, as <HI>Prae-Adamites, Sabbatarians, Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦nians, Muggletonians, Brownists, Independants, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦sonites, Camisars,</HI> and the like. At the Approac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Persecution,</HI> it was so contrived, that as sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held up her Bloody Flag, the whole Assembly of dead Men, like those in the <HI>Rehearsal,</HI> started up and drew their Swords. This was followed by great Clashings and Noise, when, in the Midst of the Tumult, the Figure of <HI>Moderation</HI> moved gently towards this new Army, which upon her holding up a Paper in her Hand, inscribed, <HI>Li∣berty of Conscience,</HI> immediately fell into a Heap of Carcasses, remaining in the same quiet Posture that they lay at first.</P>

<SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE>
<P>GRatitude obliges me to make this publick Acknowledgment of the eminent Service you have done my self in particular, and the whole Body of Chaplains (I hope) in general. Coming Home on <HI>Sunday</HI> about Dinner-time, I found Things strangely altered for the better; the Porter smiled in my Face when he let me in, the Footman bowed to me as I passed him, the Steward shook me by the Hand, and Mrs. <HI>Beatrice</HI> drop'd me a Courtesie as she went along. I was surprized at all this Civility, and knew not to what I might ascribe it, except to my bright Beaver and shining Scarf that were new that Day. But I was still more astonished to find such an agreeable Change at the Table: My Lord helped me to a fat Slice of Venison with his own Hand, and my Lady did me the Honour to drink to me. I offered to rise at my usual Time, but was desired to fit still, with this kind Expression: Come Doctor, a Gelly or a Conserve will do you no Harm; don't be a∣fraid of the Dessert. I was so confounded with the Favour, that I returned my Thanks in a most aukward Manner, wondering what was the Meaning of this total Transformation: But

<HEAD>A Continuation of the Journal of the <HI>Court of Ho∣nour,</HI> held in <HI>Sheer-Lane</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> the 27th of <HI>November,</HI> before <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Censor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ELizabeth Makebate,</HI> of the Parish of St. <HI>Cathe∣rine</HI>'s, Spinster, was indicted for surrepti∣tiously taking away the Hassock from under the Lady <HI>Grave-Airs,</HI> between the Hours of Four and Five, on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 26th of <HI>November.</HI> The Pro∣secutor deposed, That as she stood up to make a Courtesie to a Person of Quality in a neighbour∣ing Pew, the Criminal conveyed away the Has∣sock by Stealth, insomuch that the Prosecutor was obliged to fit all the while she was at Church, or to say her Prayers in a Posture that did not become a Woman of her Quality. The
<PB N="310" REF="320"/>
Prisoner pleaded Inadvertency; and the Jury were going to bring it in Chance-medley, had not several Witnesses been produced against the said <HI>Elizabeth Makebate,</HI> that she was an old Of∣fender, and a Woman of a bad Reputation. It appeared in particular, That on the <HI>Sunday</HI> before she had detracted from a new Petticoat of Mrs. <HI>Ma∣ry Doelittle,</HI> having said in the Hearing of several credible Witnesses, that the said Petticoat was scowred, to the great Grief and Detriment of the said <HI>Mary Doelittle.</HI> There were likewise many Evidences produced against the Criminal, that though she never failed to come to Church on <HI>Sunday,</HI> she was a most notorious Sabbath-Brea∣ker, and that she spent her whole Time, during Divine Service, in disparaging other People's Clothes, and whispering to those who sat next her. Upon the whole, she was found guilty of the Indictment, and received Sentence to ask Pardon of the Prosecutor upon her bare Knees, without either Cushion or Hassock under her, in the Face of the Court.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> As soon as the Sentence was executed on the Criminal, which was done in open Court with the utmost Severity, the first Lady of the Bench on Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI>'s Right Hand stood up, and made a Motion to the Court, That whereas it was impossible for Women of Fashion to dress themselves before the Church was half done, and whereas many Confusions and Inconveniencies did arise thereupon, it might be lawful for them to send a Footman, in order to keep their Places, as was usual in other polite and well regulated Assemblies. The Motion was ordered to be en∣tred in the Books, and considered at a more con∣venient Time.</P>
<P><HI>Charles Cambrick,</HI> Linendraper, in the City of <HI>Westminster,</HI> was indicted for speaking obscenely to the Lady <HI>Penolope Youthwood.</HI> It appeared, That the Prosecutor and her Woman going in a
<PB N="311" REF="321"/>
Stage-Coach from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Brentford,</HI> where they were to be met by the Lady's own Chariot, the Criminal and another of his Acquaintance travelled with them in the same Coach, at which Time the Prisoner talked Bawdy for the Space of Three Miles and a half. The Prosecutor alledg∣ed, That over against the <HI>Old Fox</HI> at <HI>Knights∣bridge</HI> he mentioned the Word Linen; That at the further End of <HI>Kensington</HI> he made Use of the Term Smock; and that before he came to <HI>Ham∣mersmith,</HI> he talked almost a Quarter of an Hour upon Wedding-Shifts. The Prosecutor's Woman confirmed what her Lady had said, and added further, That she had never seen her La∣dy in so great a Confusion, and in such a Ta∣king, as she was during the whole Discourse of the Criminal. The Prisoner had little to say for himself, but that he talked only in his own Trade, and meant no Hurt by what he said. The Jury however found him guilty, and represented by their Forewoman, That such Discourses were apt to sully the Imagination, and that by a Concate∣nation of Idea's, the Word Linen implied many Things that were not proper to be stirred up in the Mind of a Woman who was of the Prosecu∣tor's Quality, and therefore gave it as their Ver∣dict, That the Linendraper should lose his Tongue. Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> said, he thought the Prosecutor's Ears were as much to blame as the Prisoner's Tongue, and therefore gave Sentence as follows: That they should both be placed over-against one another in the Midst of the Court, there to re∣main for the Space of one Quarter of an Hour, during which Time, the Linendraper was to be gagged, and the Lady to hold her Hands close upon both her Ears, which was executed accor∣dingly.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Callicoat</HI> was indicted as an Accomplice to <HI>Charles Cambrick,</HI> for that he the said <HI>Edward Callicoat</HI> did, by his Silence and his Smiles, seem
<PB N="312" REF="322"/>
to approve and abet the said <HI>Charles Cambrick</HI> in every Thing he said. It appeared, That the Pri∣soner was Foreman of the Shop to the aforesaid <HI>Charles Cambrick,</HI> and by his Post obliged to smile at every Thing that the other should be pleased to say: Upon which he was acquitted.</P>
<P><HI>Josias Shallow</HI> was indicted in the Name of Dame <HI>Winifred,</HI> sole Relict of <HI>Richard Dainty</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for having said several Times in Company, and in the Hearing of several Persons there present, That he was extremely obliged to the Widow <HI>Dainty,</HI> and that he should never be able suffi∣ciently to express his Gratitude. The Prosecutor urged, That this might blaft her Reputation, and that it was in Effect a boasting of Favours which he had never received. The Prisoner seemed to be much astonished at the Construction which was put upon his Words, and said, That he meant nothing by them, but that the Widow had befriended him in a Lease, and was very kind to his younger Sister. The Jury finding him a little weak in his Understanding, without going out of the Court, brought in their Verdict <HI>Igno∣ramus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ursula Goodenough</HI> was accused by the Lady <HI>Betty Wou'dbe,</HI> for having said, That she the Lady <HI>Betty Wou'dbe</HI> was painted. The Prisoner brought several Persons of good Credit to witness to her Reputation, and proved by undeniable Evidences, that she was never at the Place where the Words were said to have been uttered. The Censor ob∣serving the Behaviour of the Prosecutor, found Reason to believe that she had indicted the Priso∣ner for no other Reason but to make her Com∣plexion be taken Notice of, which indeed was very fresh and beautiful: He therefore asked the Offender with a very stern Voice, How she could presume to spread so groundless a Report? And whether she saw any Colours in the Lady <HI>Wou'd∣be</HI>'s Face that could procure Credit to such a
<PB N="313" REF="323"/>
Falshood? Do you see (says he) any Lillies or Roses in her Cheeks, any Bloom, any Probabili∣ty?—The Prosecutor, not able to bear such Language any longer, told him, That he talked like a blind old Fool, and that she was asham'd to have entertain'd any Opinion of his Wisdom: But she was soon put to Silence, and sentenced to wear her Mask for Five Months, and not to presume to show her Face till the Town should be empty.</P>
<P><HI>Benjamin Buzzard</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was indicted for having told the Lady <HI>Everbloom</HI> at a publick Ball, That she looked very well for a Woman of her Years. The Prisoner not denying the Fact, and persisting before the Court that he looked upon it as a Compliment, the Jury brought him in <HI>Non Com∣pos Mentis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Court then adjourned to</HI> Monday <HI>the</HI> 11<HI>th Instant.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>December 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE have a very learned and elaborate Dis∣sertation upon Thumbs in <HI>Montaigne</HI>'s <HI>Es∣says,</HI> and another upon Ears in the <HI>Tale of a Tub.</HI> I am here going to write one upon Noses, having chosen for my Text the following Verses out of <HI>Hudibras:</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="314" REF="324"/>
<L>So learned <HI>Talicotius</HI> from</L>
<L>The brawny Part of Porter's Bum</L>
<L>Cut Supplemental Noses, which</L>
<L>Lasted as long as Parent Breech:</L>
<L>But when the Date of Nock was out,</L>
<L>Off drop'd the Sympathetick Snout.</L></Q>
<P>Notwithstanding that there is nothing obscene in Natural Knowledge, and that I intend to give as little Offence as may be to Readers of a well∣bred Imagination, I must, for my own Quiet, de∣sire the Criticks (who in all Times have been fa∣mous for good Noses) to refrain from the Lecture of this curious Tract. These Gentlemen were formerly marked out and distinguished by the little Rhinocerical Nose, which was always look∣ed upon as an Instrument of Derision, and which they were used to cock, toss, or draw up in a contemptuous Manner, upon reading the Works of their ingenious Contemporaries. It is not therefore for this Generation of Men that I write the present Transaction,<Q><L>— Minus aptus acutis</L>
<L>Naribus horum Hominum —</L></Q>
But for the Sake of some of my Philosophical Friends in the Royal Society, who peruse Dis∣courses of this Nature with a becoming Gravity, and a Desire of improving by them.</P>
<P>Many are the Opinions of learned Men con∣cerning the Rise of that fatal Distemper which has always taken a particular Pleasure in venting its Spight upon the Nose. I have seen a little Burlesque Poem in <HI>Italian</HI> that gives a very plea∣sant Account of this Matter. The Fable of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ns thus: <HI>Mars,</HI> the God of War, having served during the Siege of <HI>Naples</HI> in the Shape of a <HI>French</HI> Colonel, received a Visit one Night from <HI>Venus,</HI> the Goddess of Love, who had been al∣ways his professed Mistress and Admirer. The
<PB N="315" REF="325"/>
Poem says, she came to him in the Disguise of a Suttling Wench, with a Bottle of Brandy under her Arm. Let that be as it will, he managed Matters so well, that she went away big-bellied, and was at length brought to Bed of a little <HI>Cu∣pid.</HI> This Boy, whether it were by Reason of any bad Food that his Father had eaten during the Siege, or of any particular Malignity in the Stars that reigned at his Nativity, came into the World with a very sickly Look, and crazy Constitution. As soon as he was able to handle his Bow, he made Discoveries of a most perverse Disposition. He dipped all his Arrows in Poison, that rotted every Thing they touched; and what was more particular, aimed all his Shafts at the Nose, quite contrary to the Practice of his elder Brothers, who had made a humane Heart their Burt in all Countries and Ages. To break him of this Ro∣guish Trick, his Parents put him to School to <HI>Mercury,</HI> who did all he could to hinder him from demolishing the Noses of Mankind; but in Spight of Education, the Boy continued very unlucky; and tho' his Malice was a little softened by good Instructions, he would very frequently let fly an invenomed Arrow, and wound his Votaries oft∣ner in the Nose than in the Heart. Thus far the Fable.</P>
<P>I need not tell my learned Reader, that <HI>Correg∣gio</HI> has drawn a <HI>Cupid</HI> taking his Lesson from <HI>Mercury,</HI> conformable to this Poem; nor that the Poem it self was designed as a Burlesque upon <HI>Fracastorius.</HI></P>
<P>It was a little after this fatal Siege of <HI>Naples</HI> that <HI>Talicotius</HI> begun to practise in a Town of <HI>Germany.</HI> He was the first Clap-Doctor that I meet with in History, and a greater Man in his Age than our celebrated Dr. <HI>Wall.</HI> He saw his Species extremely mutilated and disfigured by this new Distemper that was crept into it; and therefore, in Pursuance of a very seasonable In∣ven∣tion,
<PB N="316" REF="326"/>
set up a Manufacture of Noses, havin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first got a Patent that none should presume t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make Noses besides himself. His first Patien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was a great Man of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who had done goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Services to his Country, but in the Midst of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> unfortunately lost his Nose. <HI>Talicotius</HI> grafted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> new one on the remaining Part of the Gristle o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cartilaginous Substance, which would sneeze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> smell, take Snuff, pronounce the Letters <HI>M.</HI> or <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> and in short, do all the Functions of a Genuine and Natural Nose. There was however one Mis∣fortune in this Experiment: The <HI>Portuguese's</HI> Complexion was a little upon the Subfusk, with very black Eyes and dark Eyebrows; and the Nose being taken from a Porter that had a white <HI>German</HI> Skin, and cut out of those Parts that are not exposed to the Sun, it was very visible that the Features of his Face were not Fellows. In a Word, the <HI>Comdé</HI> resembled one of those maimed antique Statues that has often a modern Nose of fresh Marble glewed to a Face of such a yellow Ivory Complexion as nothing can give but Age. To remedy this Particular for the future, the Doctor got together a great Collection of Porters, Men of all Complexions, black, brown, fair, dark, sallow, pale, and ruddy; so that it was impossible for a Patient of the most out-of-the-way Colour not to find a Nose to match it.</P>
<P>The Doctor's House was now very much en∣larged, and become a Kind of College, or rather Hospital, for the fashionable Cripples of both Sexes that resorted to him from all Parts of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> Over his Door was fastened a large Golden Snout, not unlike that which is placed over the great Gates at <HI>Brazen-Nose</HI> College in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and as it is usual for the Learned in Foreign Uni∣versities to distinguish their Houses by a <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence, the Doctor writ underneath this great Golden Proboscis Two Verses out of <HI>Ovid:</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="317" REF="327"/>
<L>Militat omnis Amans, habet &amp; sua Castra Cupido,</L>
<L>Pontice, crede mihi, militat omnis Amans.</L></Q>
<P>It is reported, That <HI>Talicotius</HI> had at one Time in his House Twelve <HI>German</HI> Counts, Nineteen <HI>French</HI> Marquisses, and a Hundred <HI>Spanish</HI> Cava∣liers, besides One solitary <HI>English</HI> Esquire, of whom more hereafter. Tho' the Doctor had the Monopoly of Noses in his own Hands, he is said not to have been unreasonable. Indeed if a Man had Occasion for a high <HI>Roman</HI> Nose, he must go to the Price of it. A Carbuncle Nose likewise bore an excessive Rate: But for your ordinary short turned-up Noses, of which there was the greatest Consumption, they cost little or nothing; at least the Purchasers thought so, who would have been content to have paid much dearer for them, rather than to have gone without them.</P>
<P>The Sympathy betwixt the Nose and its Parent was very extraordinary. <HI>Hudibras</HI> has told us, that when the Porter died, the Nose dropped of Course, in which Case it was always usual to return the Nose, in order to have it interred with its first Owner. The Nose was likewise affected by the Pain as well as Death of the Original Proprietor. An eminent Instance of this Nature happen'd to Three <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whose Noses were all made out of the same Piece of Brawn. They found them one Day shoot and swell extremely; upon which they sent to know how the Porter did, and heard upon Enquiry, that the Parent of the Noses had been severely kicked the Day before, and that the Porter kept his Bed on Account of the Bruises it had received. This was highly resented by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who found out the Person that had used the Porter so unmercifully, and treated him in the same Manner as if the Indignity had been done to their own Noses. In this and several o∣ther Cases it might be said, That the Porters led the Gentlemen by the Nose.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="328"/>
On the other Hand, if any Thing went a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> with the Nose, the Porter felt the Effects of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> insomuch that it was generally articled with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Patient, that he should not only abstain from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his old Courses, but should on no Pretence wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦soever smell Pepper, or eat Mustard; on whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Occasion, the Part where the Incision had be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> made was seized with unspeakable Twinges a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Prickings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Englishman</HI> I before mentioned was so ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> irregular, and relapsed so frequently into the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦stemper which at first brought him to the lear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>Talicotius,</HI> that in the Space of Two Years he wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> out Five Noses, and by that Means so torment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the Porters, that if he would have given 500<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> for a Nose, there was not one of them that wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> accommodate him. This young Gentleman w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> born of honest Parents, and passed his first Yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in Fox-hunting; but accidentally quitting t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Woods, and coming up to <HI>London,</HI> he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> charmed with the Beauties of the Play-hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> that he had not been in Town Two Days befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> he got the Misfortune which carried off this P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of his Face.

<P>I shall close this Paper with an Admonition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the young Men of this Town, which I think t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> more necessary, because I see several new fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> coloured Faces, that have made their first A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦pearance in it this Winter.

to know the Value of any Thing till they have lost it.

<P>IT is the Duty of all who make Philosophy the Entertainment of their Lives, to turn their Thoughts to practical Schemes for the Good of Society, and not pass away their Time in fruit∣less Searches, which tend rather to the Ostenta∣tion of Knowledge than the Service of Life.

By this Means, such whose Fortunes depend upon their own Industry, or Personal Qualifications, need not be deterred by Fear of Poverty from that State which Nature and Reason prescribe to us as the Fountain of the greatest Happiness in Hu∣mane Life. The Censors of <HI>Rome</HI> had Power vested in them to lay Taxes on the unmarried; and I think I cannot show my Impartiality better than in enquiring into the extravagant Privileges my Brother Batchelors enjoy, and fine them accord∣ingly.

It would not, methinks, be amiss, if an old Bat∣chelor, who lives in Contempt of Matrimony, were obliged to give a Portion to an old Maid who is willing to enter into it.

But such as pretend an Aversion to the whole Sex, be∣cause they were ill treated by a particular Female, and cover their Sense of Disappointment in Wo∣men under a Contempt of their Favour, shall be proceeded against as Batchelors Convict.

Accordingly I lately troubled you with my Request and Commission for placing half a Dozen Youths with Mr. <HI>More,</HI> Writing-Master in <HI>Castle-street,</HI> to whom, it is said, we owe all the fine Devices, Flourishes, and the Com∣posure of all the Plates, for the Drawing and paying the Tickets. Be pleased therefore, good Sir, to find or make Leisure for complying there∣with, for I would not appear concerned in this small Matter. I am very much</P>

<HEAD>Journal of the <HI>Court of Honour,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TImothy Treatall</HI> Gent. was indicated by seve∣ral Ladies of his Sisters Acquaintance for a very rude Affront offered to them at an Entertain∣ment, to which he had invited them on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 7th of <HI>November</HI> last past, between the Hours of Eight and Nine in the Evening. The Indict∣ment set forth, That the said Mr. <HI>Treatall,</HI> upon the Serving up of the Supper, desired the Ladies to take their Places according to their different Age and Seniority, for that it was the Way always at his Table to pay Respect to Years. The ind ct∣ment added, That this produced an unspeakable
<PB N="324" REF="334"/>
Confusion in the Company; for that the Ladies who before had pressed together for a Placo at the upper End of the Table, immediately crowded with the same Disorder towards the End that was quite opposite; That Mrs. <HI>Frontly</HI> had the Inso∣leuce to clap her self down at the very lowest Place of the Table; That the Widow <HI>Partlett</HI> seated her self on the Right Hand of Mrs. <HI>Frontly,</HI> alledging for her Excuse, that no Ceremony was to be used at a Round Table; That Mrs. <HI>Fidges</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Fescue</HI> disputed above half an Hour for the same Chair, and that the latter would not give up the Cause till it was decided by the Pa∣rish Register, which happened to be kept hard by. The Indictment further said. That the rest of the Company who sat down, did it with a Reserve to their Right, which they were at Liberty to assert on another Occasion; and that Mrs. <HI>Mary Pippe,</HI> an old Maid, was placed by the unanimous Vote of the whole Company at the upper End of the Table, from whence she had the Confusion to be∣hold several Mothers of Families among her In∣feriors. The Criminal alledged in his Defence, That what he had done, was to raise Mirth, and avoid Ceremony, and that the Ladies did not complain of his Rudeness till the next Morning, having eaten up what he had provided for them with great Readiness and Alacrity. The Censor frowning upon him, told him, That he ought not to discover so much Levity in Matters of a serious Nature, and (upon the Jury's bringing him in guilty) sentenced him to treat the whole Assem∣bly of Ladies over again, and to take Care that he did it with the Decorum which was due to Persons of their Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Rebecoa Shapely,</HI> Spinster, was indicted by Mrs. <HI>Sarah Smack,</HI> for speaking many Words re∣siecting upon her Reputation, and the Heels of her Silk Slippers, which the Prisoner had mali∣ciousiy suggested to be two Inches higher than
<PB N="325" REF="335"/>
they really were. The Prosecutor urged, as an Aggravation of her Guilt, That the Prisoner was her self guilty of the same Kind of Forgery which she had laid to the Prosecutor's Charge, for that she the said <HI>Rebecca Shapely</HI> did always wear a Pair of Steel Bodice, and a false Rump. The Censor ordered the Slippers to be produced in open Court, where the Heels were adjudged to be of the Statutable Size. He then ordered the Grand Jury to search the Criminal, who, after some Time spent therein, acquitted her of the Bodice, but found her guilty of the Rump; upon which she received Sentence as is usual in such Cases.</P>
<P><HI>William Trippit</HI> Esquire, of the <HI>Middle-Temple,</HI> brought his Action against the Lady <HI>Elizabeth Prudely,</HI> for having refused him her Hand as he offered to lead her to her Coach from the Opera. The Plaintiff set forth, That he had entred himself into the List of those Volunteers who officiate e∣very Night behind the Boxes as Gentlemen-Ush∣ers of the Play-house; That he had been at a con∣siderable Charge in white Gloves, Periwigs, and Snuff-Boxes, in order to qualify himself for that Employment, and in Hopes of making his For∣tune by it. The Council for the Defendant re∣ply'd, That the Plaintiff had given out that he was within a Month of wedding their Client, and that she had refused her Hand to him in Ceremony, lest he should interpret it as a Promise that she would give it him in Marriage. As soon as their Plead∣ings on both Sides were finished, the Censor or∣dered the Plaintiff to be cashier'd from his Office of Gentleman-Usher to the Play-house, since it was too plain that he had undertaken it with an ill Design; and at the same Time ordered the Defendant either to marry the said Plaintiff, or to pay him Half a Crown for the new Pair of Gloves and Coach-hire that he was at the Expence of in her Service.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="336"/>
The Lady <HI>Townly</HI> brought an Action of Debt a¦gainst Mrs. <HI>Flambeau,</HI> for that the said Mrs. <HI>Flam¦beau</HI> had not been to see the said Lady <HI>Townly,</HI> and wish her Joy, since her Marriage with Sir <HI>Ralph,</HI> notwithstanding she the said Lady <HI>Townly</HI> had paid Mrs. <HI>Flambeau</HI> a Visit upon her first coming to Town. It was urged in the Behalf of the De∣fendant, That the Plaintiff had never given her any regular Notice of her being in Town; That the Visit she alledged had been made on a <HI>Monday,</HI> which she knew was a Day on which Mrs. <HI>Flam∣beau</HI> was always abroad, having set aside that only Day in the Week to mind the Affairs of her Fami∣ly; That the Servant who enquired whether she was at Home, did not give the Visiting-Knock; That it was not between the Hours of Five and Eight in the Evening; That there was no Can∣dles lighted up; That it was not on Mrs. <HI>Flam∣beau</HI>'s Day; and in short, That there was not one of the essential Points observed that constitute a Visit. She further proved by her Porter's Book, which was produced in Court, that she had paid the Lady <HI>Townly</HI> a Visit on the Twenty fourth Day of <HI>March,</HI> just before her leaving the Town, in the Year 1709-10, for which she was still Cre∣ditor to the said Lady <HI>Townly.</HI> To this the Plain∣tiff only replied, That she was now under Co∣vert, and not liable to any Debts contracted when she was a single Woman. Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> finding the Cause to be very intricate, and that several Points of Honour were likely to arise in it, he de∣ferred giving Judgment upon it till the next Session Day, at which Time he ordered the Ladies on his Left Hand to present to the Court a Table of all the Laws relating to Visits.</P>
<P><HI>Winifred Lear</HI> brought her Action against <HI>Ri∣chard Sly,</HI> for having broken a Marriage Contract, and wedded another Woman, after he had enga∣ged himself to marry the said <HI>Winifred Lear.</HI> She alledged, That he had ogled her twice ar an Ope∣ra,
<PB N="327" REF="337"/>
thrice in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Church, and once at <HI>Powel</HI>'s Puppet-Show, at which Time he promi∣sed her Marriage by a Side-Glance, as her Friend could testify that sat by her. Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> find∣ing that the Defendant had made no further Over∣ture of Love or Marriage, but by Looks, and Ocu∣lar Engagement; yet at the same Time consider∣ing how very apt such impudent Seducers are to lead the Ladies Hearts astray, ordered the Crimi∣nal to stand upon the Stage in the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> be∣tween each Act of the next Opera, there to be exposed to publick View as a false <HI>Ogler.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Rising of the Court, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> having taken one of these Counterfeits in the very Fact as he was ogling a Lady of the Grand Jury, ordered him to be seized, and prosecuted upon the Statute of Ogling. He likewise directed the Clerk of the Court to draw up an Edict against these common Cheats, that make Women believe they are distracted for them by staring them out of Countenance, and often blast a Lady's Reputa∣tion whom they never spoke to, by saucy Looks and distant Familiarities.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>Dec. 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AN old Friend of mine being lately come to Town, I went to see him on <HI>Tusday</HI> last about Eight a Clock in the Evening, with a Design to sit with him an Hour or two, and talk over old Stories; but upon enquiring after him, his Servant told me he was just gone to Bed. The next Morn∣ing, as soon as I was up and dressed, and had dis∣patched
<PB N="328" REF="338"/>
a little Business, I came again to my Friend's House about Eleven a Clock, with a Design to renew my Visit; but upon asking for him, his Servant told me he was just sat down to Dinner. In short, I found that my old fashioned Friend religiously adhered to the Example of his Fore-fathers, and observed the same Hours that had been kept in the Family ever since the Con∣quest.</P>
<P>It is very plain, that the Night was much longer formerly in this Island than it is at present. By the Night, I mean that Portion of Time which Nature has thrown into Darkness, and which the Wisdom of Mankind had formerly dedicated to Rest and Silence. This used to begin at Eight a Clock in the Evening, and conclude at Six in the Morning. The Corfeu, or Eight a Clock Bell, was the Signal throughout the Nation for putting out their Candles and going to Bed.</P>
<P>Our Grandmothers, tho' they were wont to sit up the last in the Family, were all of them fast asleep at the same Hours that their Daughters are busy at Crimp and Basset. Modern Statesmen are concerting Schemes, and engaged in the Depth of Politicks, at the Time when their Fore-fathers were laid down quietly to Rest, and had nothing in their Heads but Dreams. As we have thus thrown Business and Pleasure into the Hours of Rest, and by that Means made the natural Night but half as long as it should be, we are forced to piece it out with a great Part of the Morning; so that near Two thirds of the Nation lie fast asleep for several Hours in broad Day-light. This Irre∣gularity is grown so very fashionable at present, that there is scarce a Lady of Quality in <HI>Great Britain</HI> that ever saw the Sun rise. And if the Humour encreases in Proportion to what it has done of late Years, it is not impossible but our Children may hear the Bell-Man going about the Streets at Nine a Clock in the Morning, and the
<PB N="329" REF="339"/>
Watch making their Rounds till Eleven. This unaccountable Disposition in Mankind to continue awake in the Night, and sleep in Sunshine, has made me enquire, Whether the same Change of Inclination has happened to any other Animals? For this Reason I desired a Friend of mine in the Country to let me know, Whether the Lark rises as early as he did formerly? And whether the Cock begins to crow at his usual Hour? My Friend has answered me, That his Poultry are as regular as ever, and that all the Birds and the Beasts of his Neighbourhood keep the same Hours that they have observed in the Memory of Man; and the same which, in all Probability, they have kept for these Five Thousand Years.</P>
<P>If you would see the Innovations that have been made among us in this Particular, you may only look into the Hours of Colleges, where they still dine at Eleven, and sup at Six, which were doubt∣less the Hours of the whole Nation at the Time when those Places were founded. But at present the Courts of Justice are scarce opened in <HI>West∣minster-Hall</HI> at the Time when <HI>William Rufus</HI> used to go to Dinner in it. All Business is driven forward: The Land Marks of our Fathers (if I may so call them) are removed, and planted fur∣ther up into the Day; insomuch that I am afraid our Clergy will be obliged (if they expect full Congregations) not to look any more upon Ten a Clock in the Morning as a Canonical Hour. In my own Memory the Dinner has crept by Degrees from Twelve a Clock to Three, and where it will fix no Body knows.</P>
<P>I have sometimes thought to draw up a Memo∣rial in the Behalf of Supper against Dinner, set∣ting forth, That the said Dinner has made several Encroachments upon the said Supper, and entered very far upon his Frontiers; That he has banished him out of several Families, and in all has driven him from his Head Quarters, and forced him to

such new Supplies of Animal Spirits, that she finds her self in a State of Youth, especially when she is entertained with the Breath of Flowers, the Melody of Birds, the Dews that hang upon the Plants, and all those other Sweets of Nature that are peculiar to the Morning.</P>
<P>It is impossible for a Man to have this Relish of Being, this exquisite Tast of Life, who does not come into the World before it is in all its Noise and Hurry; who loses the Rising of the Sun, the still Hours of the Day, and immediately upon his first getting up plunges himself into the ordinary Cares or Follies of the World.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Paper with <HI>Milton</HI>'s inimi∣table Description of <HI>Adam</HI>'s awakening his <HI>Eve</HI> in Paradise, which indeed would have been a Place as little delightful as a barren Heath or De∣sert to those who slept in it.

It was said of two an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ent Authors who had very different Beauties in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eir Style, That if you took a Word from one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>em, you only spoiled his Eloquence; but if you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ok a Word from the other, you spoiled his Sense. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have often applied the first Part of this Criticism <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> several of these Coffee-house Speakers whom I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave at present in my Thoughts, tho' the Cha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acter that is given to the last of those Authors is what I would recommend to the Imitation of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oving Countrymen: But it is not only publick Places of Resort, but private Clubs and Conver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations over a Bottle, that are infested with this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oquacious Kind of Animal, especially with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pecies which I comprehend under the Name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Story-Teller. I would earnestly desire these Gentlemen to consider, that no Point of Wit or Mirth at the End of a Story can attone for the Half-Hour that has been lost before they come at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. I would likewise lay it home to their serious Consideration, Whether they think that every Man in the Company has not a Right to speak as well as themselves? And whether they do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hink they are invading another Man's Property, when they engross the Time which should be di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ided equally amongst the Company to their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivate Use?</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="344"/>
What makes this Evil the much greater in Con¦versation is, that these Humdrum Companion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seldom endeavour to wind up their Narrations in¦to a Point of Mirth or Instruction, which might make some Amends for the Tediousness of them, but think they have a Right to tell any Thing that has happened within their Memory. They look upon Matter of Fact to be a sufficient Foun∣dation for a Story, and give us a long Account of Things, not because they are entertaining or sur∣prizing, but because they are true.</P>
<P>My ingenious Kinsman, Mr. <HI>Humphrey Wagstaff</HI> uses to say, The Life of Man is too short for a Story-Teller.</P>
<P><HI>Methusalem</HI> might be half an Hour in telling what a Clock it was; but as for us Postdiluvians, we ought to do every Thing in Hast; and in our Speeches, as well as Actions, remember that our Time is short. A Man that talks for a Quarter of an Hour together in Company, if I meet him frequently, takes up a great Part of my Span. A Quarter of an Hour may be reckoned the Eight and fortieth Part of a Day, a Day the Three hun∣dred and sixtieth Part of a Year, and a Year the Threescore and tenth Part of Life. By this moral Arithmetick, supposing a Man to be in the Talk∣ing World one third Part of the Day, whoever gives another a Quarter of an Hour's Hearing, makes him a Sacrifice of more than the Four hun∣dred thousandth Part of his Conversable Life.</P>
<P>I would establish but one great general Rule to be observed in all Conversation, which is this, <HI>That Men should not talk to please themselves, but those that hear them.</HI> This would make them consider, Whether what they speak be worth Hearing? Whether there be either Wit or Sense in what they are about to say? And, Whether it be adapted to the Time when, the Place where, and the Person to whom, it is spoken?</P>

<HEAD>Continuation of the Journal of the <HI>Court of Honour,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as the Court was sat, the Ladies of the Bench presented, according to Order, a Table of all the Laws now in Force relating to Visits and Visiting-Days, methodically digested under their respective Heads, which the Censor ordered to be laid upon the Table, and after∣wards proceeded upon the Business of the Day.</P>
<P><HI>Henry Heedless</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was indicted by Colonel <HI>Touchy,</HI> of Her Majesty's Trained-Bands, upon an Action of Assault and Battery; for that he the said Mr. <HI>Heedless</HI> having espied a Feather upon the Shoulder of the said Colonel, struck it of gently with the End of a Walking-Staff, Value Three Pence. It appeared, That the Prosecutor did not think himself injured till a few Days after the aforesaid Blow was given him; but that having ruminated with himself for several Days, and conferred upon it with other Officers of the Militia, he concluded, that he had in Ef∣fect been cudgelled by Mr. <HI>Heedless,</HI> and that he ought to resent it accordingly. The Council for the Prosecutor alledged, That the Shoulder was the tenderest Part in a Man of Honour; That it

The Prisoner further brought se¦veral Witnesses. That the said <HI>Jasper Tattle</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was a most notorious Story-Teller; That before he met the Prisoner, he had hindred one of the Prisoners Acquaintance from the Pursuit of his lawful Business, with the Account of his Second Marriage; and that he had detained ano∣ther by the Button of his Coat that very Morn∣ing, till he had heard several witty Sayings and Contrivances of the Prosecutor's eldest Son, who was a Boy of about Five Years of Age. Upon the whole Matter, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> dismissed the Accusation as frivolous, and sentenced the Prose∣cutor to pay Damages to the Prisoner for what the Prisoner had lost by giving him so long and patient an Hearing. He further reprimanded the Prosecutor very severely, and told him, That if he proceeded in his usual Manner to interrupt the Business of Mankind, he would set a Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> upon him for every Quarter of an Hour's Imper∣tinence, and regulate the said Fine according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Time of the Person so injured should appear to be more or less precious.</P>

<P>IT would be a good Appendix to <HI>the Art of Li∣ving and Dying,</HI> if any one would write <HI>the Art of Growing Old,</HI> and teach Men to resign their Pretensions to the Pleasures and Gallantries of Youth, in Proportion to the Alteration they find in themselves by the Approach of Age and Infirmities. The Infirmities of this Stage of Life would be much fewer, if we did not affect those which attend the more vigorous and active Part of our Days; but instead of studying to be wiser, or being contented with our present Fol∣lies, the Ambition of many of us is also to be the same Sort of Fools we formerly have been. I have often argued, as I am a professed Lover of Women, that our Sex grows old with a much worse Grace than the other does; and have ever been of Opinion, that there are more well-plea∣sed old Women than old Men. I thought it a good Reason for this, that the Ambition of the Fair Sex being confined to advantagious Mar∣riages, or shining in the Eyes of Men, their Parts were over sooner, and consequently the Errors in the Performance of them. The Conversation of this Evening has not convinced me of the con∣trary; for one or two Fop Women shall not make a Ballance for the Crowds of Coxcombs among our selves, diversified according to the different Pursuits of Pleasure and Business.</P>

Returning Home this Evening a little before my usual Hour, I scarce had seated my self in my Easy Chair, stirred the Fire, and stroaked my Cat, but I heard some Body come rumbling up Stairs. I saw my Door opened, and a Humane Figure ad∣vancing towards me, so fantastically put together, 'twas some Minutes before I discovered it to be my old and intimate Friend <HI>Sam. Trusty.</HI> Imme∣diately I rose up, and placed him in my own Seat, a Compliment I pay to few. The first Thing he utter'd was, <HI>Isaac,</HI> Fetch me a Cup of your Cherry-Brandy before you offer to ask me any Question. He drunk a lusty Draught, sat silent for some Time, and at last broke out; I am come (quoth he) to insult Thee for an old fantastick Dotard as thou art in ever defending the Wo∣men. I have this Evening visited Two Widows, who are now in that State I have often heard you call an After-Life: I suppose you mean by it, an Existence which grows out of past Enter∣tainments, and is an untimely Delight in the Sa∣tisfactions which they once set their Hearts upon too much to be ever able to relinquish. Have but Patience, (continued he) till I give you a suc∣cinct Account of my Ladies, and of this Night's Adventure. They are much of an Age, but very different in their Characters: The one of them, with all the Advances which Years have made upon her, goes on in a certain Romantick Road of Love and Friendship which she fell into in her Teens; the other has transferred the amo∣rous Passions of her first Years to the Love of Cronies, Petts and Favourites, with which she is always surrounded; but the Genius of each of them will best appear by the Account of what happened to me at their Houses. About Five this Afternoon, being tired with Study, the Weather inviting, and Time lying a little upon my Hands, I resolved, at the Instigation of my Evil Genius, to visit them, their Husbands having been our

I went first to my Lady <HI>Camomile,</HI> and the Butler, who had lived long in the Family, and seen me often in his Master's Time, ushered me very civilly into the Parlour, and told me, Though my Lady had given strict Orders to be denied, he was sure I might be admitted, and bid the Black-Boy acquaint his Lady, that I was to wait upon her. In the Window lay Two Let∣ters, one broke open, the other fresh sealed with a Wafer: The first directed to the Divine <HI>Cos∣melia,</HI> the second to the Charming <HI>Lucinda;</HI> but both, by the indented Characters, appeared to have been writ by very unsteady Hands. Such uncommon Addresses increased my Curiosity, and put me upon asking my old Friend the Butler, If he knew who those Persons were? Very well, says he: This is from Mrs. <HI>Furbish</HI> to my Lady, an old School-Fellow and great Crony of her La∣dyship's, and this the Answer. I enquired in what Country she lived. Oh dear! says he, but just by in the Neighbourhood. Why, she was here all this Morning, and that Letter came and was answered within these Two Hours. They have taken an odd Fancy, you must know, to call one another hard Names, but for all that they love one another hugely. By this Time the Boy returned with his Lady's humble Service to me, desiring I would excuse her, for she could not possibly see me, nor any Body else, for it was Opera Night.</P>
<P>Methinks, (says I) such innocent Folly as Two old Women's Courtship to each other should rather make you merry, than put you out of Humour. Peace, good <HI>Isaac,</HI> (says he) no Inter∣ruption I beseech you. I got soon to Mrs. <HI>Fee∣ble</HI>'s, she that was formerly <HI>Betty Frisk;</HI> you must needs remember het, <HI>Tom. Feeble</HI> of <HI>Brazen-Nose</HI> fell in Love with her for her fine Dancing.
<PB N="343" REF="353"/>
Well, Mrs. <HI>Ursula,</HI> without further Ceremony, carries me directly up to her Mistress's Chamber, where I found her environ'd by Four of the most mischievous Animals that can ever infest a Fa∣mily: An old Shock Dog with one Eye, a Mon∣key chaned to one Side of the Chimney, a great grey Squirrel to the other, and a Parrat wad∣dling in the middle of the Room. However, for a while, all was in a profound Tranquillity. Upon the Mantle-Tree, for I am a pretty curious Observer, stood a Pot of Lambetive Electuary, with a Stick of Liquorish, and near it a Phyal of Rose-Water and Powder of Tutty. Upon the Table lay a Pipe filled with Bettony and Colts-Foot, a Roll of Wax-Candle, a Silver Spitting-Pot, and a <HI>Seville</HI> Orange. The Lady was pla∣ced in a large Wicker Chair, and her Feet wrap∣ped up in Flannel, supported by Cushions; and in this Attitude (would you believe it <HI>Isaac</HI>) was she reading a Romance with Spectacles on. The first Compliments over, as she was industri∣ously endeavouring to enter upon Conversation, a violent Fit of Coughing seized her. This a∣wakened Shock, and in a Trice the whole Room was in an Uproar; for the Dog barked, the Squirrel squealed, the Monkey chattered, the Parrat screamed, and <HI>Ursula,</HI> to appease them, was more clamorous than all the rest. You <HI>Isaac,</HI> who know how any harsh Noise affects my Head, may guess what I suffered from the hi∣deous Din of these discordant Sounds. At length all was appeased, and Quiet restored: A Chair was drawn for me, where I was no sooner seat∣ed, but the Parrat fixed his Horny Beak, as sharp as a Pair of Sheers, in one of my Heels, just above the Shoe. I sprung from the Place with an unusual Agility, and so being within the Monkey's Reach, he snatches off my n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Bob Wig, and throws it upon Two Apples that were roasting by a sullen Sea-Coal Fire. I was
<PB N="344" REF="354"/>
nimble enough to save it from any further Da∣mage than singeing the Foretop. I put it on, and composing my self as well as I could, I drew my Chair towards the other Side of the Chim∣ney. The good Lady, as soon as she had reco∣vered Breath, employed it in making a Thousand Apologies, and with great Eloquence, and a nu∣merous Train of Words, lamented my Misfor∣tune. In the middle of her Harangue, I felt something scratching near my Knee, and feeling what it should be, found the Squirrel had got in∣to my Coat-Pocket. As I endeavoured to re∣move him from his Burrow, he made his Teeth meet through the Fleshy Part of my Fore-Finger. This gave me an unexpressible Pain. The <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> Water was immediately brought to bath it, and Gold-beaters Skin applied to stop the Blood. The Lady renewed her Excuses; but being now out of all Patience, I abruptly took my Leave, and hobbling down Stairs with heedless Hast, I set my Foot full in a Pail of Water, and down we came to the Bottom together. Here my Friend concluded his Narrative, and, with a composed Countenance, I began to make him Compliments of Condoleance; but he started from his Chair, and said, <HI>Isaac,</HI> you may spare your Speeches, I expect no Reply: When I told you this, I knew you would laugh at me; but the next Wo∣man that makes me ridiculous shall be a young one.</P>

<P>I Have heard, that it is a Rule among the Con∣ventuals of several Orders in the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, to shut themselves up at a certain Time of the Year, not only from the World in general, but from the Members of their own Fraternity, and to pass away several Days by themselves in settling Accounts between their Maker and their own Souls, in cancelling unrepented Crimes, and renewing their Contracts of Obedience for the future. Such stated Times for particular Acts of Devotion, or the Exercise of certain religious Duties, have been enjoined in all civil Govern∣ments, whatever Deity they worshipped, or whatever Religion they professed. That which may be done at all Times, is often totally neg∣lected and forgotten, unless fixed and determin∣ed to some Time more than another; and there∣fore, though several Duties may be suitable to every Day of our Lives, they are most likely to be performed if some Days are more particularly set apart for the Practice of them. Our Church has accordingly instituted several Seasons of De∣votion, when Time, Custom, Prescription, and (if I may so say) the Fashion it self, call upon a Man to be serious and attentive to the great End of his Being.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="356"/>
I have hinted in some former Papers, that the greatest and wisest of Men in all Ages and Coun∣tries, particularly in <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> were re∣nowned for their Piety and Virtue. It is now my Intention to show how those in our own Na∣tion, that have been unquestionably the most eminent for Learning and Knowledge, were likewise the most eminent for their Adherence to the Religion of their Country.</P>
<P>I might produce very shining Examples from among the Clergy; but because Priestcraft is the common Cry of every cavelling empty Scribbler, I shall show, that all the Laymen who have ex∣erted a more than ordinary Genius in their Wri∣tings, and were the Glory of their Times, were Men whose Hopes were filled with Immortality, and the Prospect of future Rewards, and Men who lived in a dutiful Submission to all the Do∣ctrines of Revealed Religion.</P>
<P>I shall in this Paper only instance Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> a Man who for the Greatness of Genius, and Compass of Knowledge, did Honour to his Age and Country; I could almost say to Hu∣mane Nature it self. He possessed at once all those extraordinary Talents which were divided amongst the greatest Authors of Antiquity. He had the sound, distinct, comprehensive Know∣ledge of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> with all the beautiful Lights, Graces and Embellishments, of <HI>Cicero.</HI> One does not know which to admire most in his Writings, the Strength of Reason, Force of Style, or Bright∣ness of Imagination.</P>
<P>This Author has remarked in several Parts of his Works, that a thorough Infight into Phi∣losophy makes a good Believer, and that a Smat∣tering in it naturally produces such a Race of despicable Infidels as the little profligate Wri∣ters of the present Age, whom (I must confess) I have always accused to my self, not so much for their Want of Faith as their Want of Learn∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="357"/>
I was infinitely pleased to find among the Works of this extraordinary Man a Prayer of his own composing, which, for the Elevation of Thought, and Greatness of Expression, seems ra∣ther the Devotion of an Angel than a Man. His principal Fault seems to have been the Excess of that Virtue which covers a Multitude of Faults. This betrayed him to so great an Indulgence to∣wards his Servants, who made a corrupt Use of it, that it strip'd him of all those Riches and Honours which a long Series of Merits had heaped upon him. But in this Prayer, at the same Time that we find him prostrating himself before the great Mercy-Seat, and humbled un∣der Afflictions which at that Time lay heavy up∣on him, we see him supported by the Sense of his Integrity, his Zeal, his Devotion, and his Love to Mankind, which give him a much higher Figure in the Minds of Thinking Men, than that Greatness had done from which he was fallen. I shall beg Leave to write down the Prayer it self, with the Title to it, as it was found among his Lordship's Papers, written in his own Hand; not being able to furnish my Reader with an Entertainment more suitable to this solemn Time.</P>
<Q><HI>A Prayer or Psalm made by my Lord</HI> Bacon, <HI>Chancellor of</HI> England.
<P>MOST gracious Lord God, my merciful Father; from my Youth up my Creator, my Redeemer, my Comforter. Thou, O Lord, soundest and searchest the Depths and Secrets of all Hearts; Thou acknowledgest the Up∣right of Heart; Thou judgest the Hypocrite; Thou ponderest Men's Thoughts and Doings as in a Ballance; Thou measurest their Intentions as with a Line; Vanity and crooked Ways cannot be hid from Thee.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="358"/>
Remember, O Lord! how thy Servant hath walked before thee; remember what I have first sought, and what hath been principal in my Intentions. I have loved thy Assemblies, I have mourned for the Divisions of thy Church, I have delighted in the Brightness of thy San∣ctuary. This Vine which thy Right Hand hath planted in this Nation, I have ever pray∣ed unto Thee that it might have the first and the latter Rain, and that it might stretch her Branches to the Seas, and to the Floods. The State and Bread of the Poor and Oppressed have been precious in mine Eyes; I have hated all Cruelty and Hardness of Heart; I have (though in a despised Weed) procured the Good of all Men. If any have been my Enemies, I thought not of them, neither hath the Sun almost set upon my Displeasure; but I have been as a Dove, free from Superfluity of Maliciousness. Thy Creatures have been my Books, but thy Scriptures much more. I have sought Thee in the Courts, Fields and Gardens, but I have found Thee in thy Temples.</P>
<P>Thousands have been my Sins, and Ten Thou∣sands my Transgressions, but thy Sanctifica∣tions have remained with me, and my Heart (through thy Grace) hath been an unquenched Coal upon thine Altar.</P>
<P>O Lord, my Strength! I have since my Youth met with Thee in all my Ways, by thy Fatherly Compassions, by thy comfortable Cha∣stisements, and by thy most visible Providence. As thy Favours have increased upon me, so have thy Corrections; so as Thou hast been al∣ways near me, O Lord! And ever as my Worldly Blessings were exalted, so secret Darts from Thee have pierced me; and when I have ascended before Men, I have descended in Hu∣miliation before Thee. And now when I thought most of Peace and Honour, thy Hand
<PB N="349" REF="359"/>
is heavy upon me, and hath humbled me ac∣cording to thy former loving Kindness, keep∣ing me still in thy Fatherly School, not as a Ba∣stard, but as a Child. Just are thy Judgments upon me for my Sins, which are more in Num∣ber than the Sands of the Sea, but have no Pro∣portion to thy Mercies; for what are the Sands of the Sea? Earth, Heavens, and all these, are nothing to thy Mercies. Besides my innu∣merable Sins, I confess before Thee, that I am Debtor to Thee for the gracious Talent of thy Gifts and Graces, which I have neither put into a Napkin, nor put it (as I ought) to Ex∣changers, where it might have made best Pro∣fit, but mispent it in Things for which I was least fit: So I may truly say, my Soul hath been a Stranger in the Course of my Pilgri∣mage. Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for my Saviour's Sake, and receive me unto thy Bosom, or guide me in thy Ways.</P></Q>

<P>AT my coming Home last Night, I found upon my Table the following Petition or Project, sent me from <HI>Lloyd</HI>'s Coffee-house in the City, with a Present of <HI>Port</HI> Wine, which
<PB N="350" REF="360"/>
had been bought at a late Auction held in that Place.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Lloyd's Coffee-house, Lombard-street, <DATE>Dec. 23.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE the Customers of this Coffee-house, observing that you have taken into your Consideration the great Mischiefs daily done in this City by Coffee-house Orators, do humbly beg Leave to represent to you, That this Coffee-house being provided with a Pulpit for the Benefit of such Auctions that are fre∣quently made in this Place, it is our Custom, upon the first coming in of the News, to order a Youth, who officiates as the Kidney of the Coffee-house, to get into the Pulpit, and read every Paper with a loud and distinct Voice, while the whole Audience are sipping their respective Liquors. We do therefore, Sir, hum∣bly propose, that there be a Pulpit erected within every Coffee-house of this City and the adjacent Parts; That one of the Waiters of the Coffee-house be nominated as Reader to the said Pulpit; That after the News of the Day has been published by the said Lecturer, some Politician of good Note do ascend into the said Pulpit; and after having chosen for his Text any Article of the said News, that he do establish the Authority of such Article, clear the Doubts that may arise thereupon, compare it with Parellel Texts in other Papers, advance upon it wholesome Points of Doctrine, and draw from it salutary Conclusions for the Be∣nefit and Edification of all that hear him. We do likewise humbly propose, That upon any such Politician's quitting the Pulpit, he shall be succeeded by any other Orator that finds himself moved by the same publick Spirit, who shall be at full Liberty either to enforce or
<PB N="351" REF="361"/>
overthrow what the other has said before him, and may in the same Manner be succeeded by any other Politician, who shall with the same Liberty confirm or impugn his Reasons, streng∣then or invalidate his Conjectures, enlarge upon his Schemes, or erect new ones of his own. We do likewise further propose, That if any Person, of what Age or Rank soever, do pre∣sume to cavil at any Paper that has been read, or to hold forth upon it longer than the Space of one Minute, that he be immediately ordered up into the Pulpit, there to make good any Thing that he has suggested upon the Floor. We do likewise further propose, That if any one plays the Orator in the ordinary Coffee-house Conversation, whether it be upon Peace or War, on Plays or Sermons, Business or Poetry, that he be forth with desired to take his Place in the Pulpit.</P>
<P>This, Sir, we humbly presume may in a great Measure put a Stop to those superficial Statesmen who would not dare to stand up in this Manner before a whole Congregation of Politicians, not∣withstanding the long and tedious Harangues and Dissertations which they daily utter in pri∣vate Circles, to the breaking of many honest Tradesmen, the seducing of several eminent Citizens, the making of numberless Malecon∣tents, and to the great Detriment and Disquiet of Her Majesty's Subjects.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>I do heartily concur with my ingenious Friends of the above-mentioned Coffee-house in these their Proposals; and because I apprehend there may be Reasons to put an immediate Stop to the Grie∣vance complained of, it is my Intention, That, till such Time as the aforesaid Pulpits can be e∣rected, every Orator do place himself within the Bar, and from thence dictate whatsoever he shall think necessary for the publick Good.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="362"/>
And further, because I am very desirous th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> proper Ways and Means should be found out f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the suppressing of Story-Tellers and fine Talke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in all ordinary Conversation whatsoever, I do i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sist, That in every private Club, Company, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meeting over a Bottle, there be always an Elbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chair placed at the Table, and that as soon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any one begins a long Story, or extends his Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦course beyond the Space of one Minute, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forthwith thrust into the said Elbow Chair, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less upon any of the Company's calling out t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Chair, he breaks off abruptly, and holds hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tongue.</P>
<P>There are Two Species of Men, notwithstand¦ing any Thing that has been here said, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would exempt from the Disgrace of the Elbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chair. The First are those Buffoons that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Talent of mimicking the Speech and Behaviou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of other Persons, and turning all their Patron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Friends and Acquaintance, into Ridicule. I loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon your <HI>Pantomime</HI> as a Legion in a Man, or at least to be like <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Monster, with an Hun∣dred Mouths and as many Tongues.
<Q><L>— Linguae centum sunt, Oraque centum.</L></Q>
And therefore would give him as much Time to talk in, as would be allowed to the whole Body of Persons he represents, were they actually in the Company which they divert by Proxy. Pro∣vided however, That the said <HI>Pantomime</HI> do not, upon any Pretence whatsoever, utter any Thing in his own particular Opinion, Language, or Cha∣racter.</P>
<P>I would likewise in the Second Place grant an Exemption from the Elbow Chair to any Person who treats the Company, and by that Means may be supposed to pay for his Audience. A Guest cannot take it ill if he be not allowed to talk in his Turn by a Person who puts his Mouth to a better Employment, and stops it with good Beef
<PB N="353" REF="363"/>
and Mutton. In this Case the Guest is very a∣greeably silenced, and seems to hold his Tongue under that Kind of Bribery which the Ancients called, <HI>Bos in Lingua.</HI></P>
<P>If I can once extirpate the Race of solid and substantial Humdrums, I hope by my whole∣some and repeated Advices, quickly to reduce the insignificant Tittle-tattles and Matter-of-Fact-Men that abound in every Quarter of this great City.</P>
<P><HI>Epictetus,</HI> in his little System of Morality, pre∣scribes the following Rule with that beautiful Simplicity which shines through all his Precepts. <HI>Beware that thou never tell thy Dreams in Compa∣ny; for notwithstanding thou may'st take a Pleasure in Telling thy Dreams, the Company will take no Pleasure in Hearing them.</HI></P>
<P>This Rule is conformable to a Maxim which I have laid down in a late Paper, and must always inculcate into those of my Readers who find in themselves an Inclination to be very talkative and impertinent, That they should not speak to please themselves, but those that hear them.</P>
<P>It has been often observed by witty Essay-Wri∣ters, That the deepest Waters are always the most silent; That empty Vessels make the greatest Sound, and tinckling Cymbals the worst Musick. The Marquess of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> in his admirable Ad∣vice to a Daughter, tells her, That good Sense has always something sullen in it: But as Sullen∣ness does not only imply Silence, but an ill-natured Silence, I wish his Lordship had given a softer Name to it. Since I am engaged unawares in Quotations, I must not omit the Satyr which <HI>Horace</HI> has written against this impertinent talka∣tive Companion, and which, I think, is fuller of Humour than any other Satyr he has written. This great Author, who had the nicest Tast of Conversation, and was himself a most agreeable Companion, had so strong an Antipathy to a great
<PB N="354" REF="364"/>
Talker, that he was afraid some Time or other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would be mortal to him, as he has very humo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦rously described it in his Conversation with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> impertinent Fellow who had like to have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the Death of him.</P>

<P>'TIS my Misfortune to be enamoured of a Lady that is neither very beautiful, very witty, nor at all well-natured; but has the Va∣nity to think she excels in all these Qualifica∣tions, and therefore is cruel, insolent, and scorn∣ful. When I study to please her, she treats me with the utmost Rudeness and ill Manners: If I approach her Person, she fights, she scratches me: If I offer a civil Salute, she bites me; inso∣much, that very lately, before a whole Assem∣bly of Ladies and Gentlemen, she rip'd out a considerable Part of my Left Cheek. This is no sooner done, but she begs my Pardon in the most handsome and becoming Terms imagina∣ble, gives her self worse Language than I could
<PB N="356" REF="366"/>
find in my Heart to do, lets me embrace her to pacify her while she is railing at her self, pro∣tests she deserves the Esteem of no one living, says I am too good to contradict her when she thus accuses her self. This attones for all, tempts me to renew my Addresses, which are ever returned in the same obliging Manner. Thus, without some speedy Relief, I am in Danger of losing my whole Face. Notwith∣standing all this, I doat upon her, and am sa∣tisfied she loves me, because she takes me for a Man of Sense, which I have generally thought, except in this one Instance. Your Re∣flections upon this strange Amour would be very useful in these Parts, where we are over-run with wild Beauties and Romps. I earnestly beg your Assistance, either to deliver me from the Power of this unaccountable Inchantment, or, by some proper Animadversions, civilize the Be∣haviour of this agreeable Rustick. I am,</P>

<P>I Now take Leave to address you in your Cha∣racter of Censor, and complain to you, That among the various Errors in Conversation which you have corrected, there is one which, tho' it has not escap'd a general Reproof, yet seems to deserve a more particular Severity. 'Tis an Hu∣mour of jesting on disagreeable Subjects, and in∣sisting on the Jest, the more it creates Uneasi∣ness; and this some Men think they have a Ti∣tle to do as Friends. Is the Design of Jesting to provoke? Or does Friendship give a Privilege to say Things with a Design to shock? How can that be call'd a Jest, which has nothing in it but Bitterness? 'Tis generally allow'd necessary,
<PB N="357" REF="367"/>
for the Peace of Company, that Men should a little study the Tempers of each others; but cer∣tainly that must be in order to shun what's of∣fensive, not to make it a constant Entertain∣ment. The frequent Repetition of what appears harsh, will unavoidably leave a Rancour that's fatal to Friendship; and I doubt much, whether it would be an Argument of a Man's good Hu∣mour, if he should be rouzed by perpetual Tea∣zing, to treat those that do it as his Enemies. In a Word, whereas 'tis a common Practice to let a Story die, meerly because it does not touch, I think such as mention one they find does, are as troublesome to Society, and as unfit for it, as <HI>Wags, Men of Fire, good Talkers,</HI> or any other Apes in Conversation; and therefore, for the publick Benefit, I hope you'll cause them to be branded with such a Name as they deserve.

<P>The Case of <HI>Ebenozer</HI> is a very common one, and is always cured by Neglect. These fantastical Returns of Affection proceed from a certain Va∣nity in the other Sex, supported by a perverted Tast in ours. I must publish it as a Rule, That no Faults which proceed from the Will, either in a Mistress or a Friend, are to be tolerated: But we should be so complaisant to Ladies, to let them displease when they aim at doing it. Pluck up a Spirit, <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> recover the Use of your Judgment, and her Faults will appear, or her Beauties vanish. <HI>Her Faults begin to please me as well as my own,</HI> is a Sentence very prettily put into the Mouth of a Lover by the Comick Poet; but he never designed it for a Maxim of Life, but the Picture of an Imperfection. If <HI>Ebenezer</HI> takes my

<P>I cannot wholly ascribe the Faults mentioned i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Second Letter to the same Vanity or Prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Companions who secretly triumph over thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Friends, in being sharp upon them in Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where they are most tender.

As obscene Language is an Ad∣dress to the Lewd for Applause, so are sharp Al∣lusions an Appeal to the Ill-natured. But mean and illiterate is that Conversation where one Man exercises his Wit to make another exercise his Patience.</P>

<P>ACcording to my late Resolution, I take the Holydays to be no improper Season to enter∣tain the Town with the Addresses of my Corres∣pondents. In my Walks every Day there appear all round me very great Offenders in the Point of Dress. An armed Taylor had the Impudence Yesterday in the <HI>Park</HI> to smile in my Face, and pull off a Laced Hat to me, as it were in Con∣tempt of my Authority and Censure. However, it is a very great Satisfaction, that other People as well as my self are offended with these Impro∣prieties. The following Notices from Persons of different Sexes and Qualities are a sufficient In∣stance how useful my Lucubrations are to the Publick.</P>

<SALUTE>Cousin <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been the peculiar Blessing of our Family to be always above the Smiles or Frowns of Fortune, and by a certain Greatness of Mind to restrain all irregular Fondnesses or Passions. From hence it is, that though a long Decay, and a numerous Descent, have obliged many of our House to fall into the Arts of Trade and Business, no one Person of us has ever made an Appearance that betrayed our be∣ing unsatisfied with our own Station of Life,
<PB N="360" REF="370"/>
or has ever affected a Mien or Gesture unsuit∣able to it.</P>
<P>You have up and down in your Writings very justly remarked, That it is not this or the other Profession or Quality among Men that gives us Honour and Esteem, but the well or ill beha∣ving our selves in those Characters. It is there∣fore with no small Concern, that I behold in Coffee-houses and publick Places my Brethren, the Tradesmen of this City, put off the smooth, even and ancient Decorum of thriving Citi∣zens, for a fantastical Dress and Figure, im∣proper for their Persons and Characters, to the utter Destruction of that Order and Di∣stinction which of Right ought to be between St. <HI>James</HI>'s and <HI>Milkstreet,</HI> the Camp and <HI>Cheap∣side.</HI></P>
<P>I have given my self some Time to find out, how distinguishing the Frays in a Lot of Mus∣lins, or drawing up a Regiment of Thread Laces, or making a Panegyrick on Pieces of Sagathy or <HI>Scotch</HI>-Plod, should entitle a Man to a Laced Hat or Sword, a Wig tied up with Ri∣bands, or an embroidered Coat. The College say, this Enormity proceeds from a Sort of De∣lirium in the Brain, which makes it break out first about the Head, and, for Want of timely Remedies, fall upon the Left Thigh, and from thence in little Mazes and Windings run over the whole Body, as appears by pretty Orna∣ments on the Buttons, Button-holes, Garter∣ings, Sides of the Breeches, and the like. I beg the Favour of you to give us a Discourse wholly upon the Subject of Habits, which will contribute to the better Government of Conver∣sation amongst us, and in particular oblige,</P>

<HEAD>The humble Petition of <HI>Ralph Nab,</HI> Haberdasher of Hats, and many other poor Sufferers of the same Trade,</HEAD>
<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THat for some Years last past the Use of Gold and Silver Galloon upon Hats has been almost universal, being undistinguishably worn by Soldiers, 'Squires, Lords, Footmen, Beaus, Sportsmen, Traders, Clerks, Prigs, Smarts, Cullies, Pretty Fellows, and Sharpers.</P>
<P>That the said Use and Custom has been Two Ways very prejudicial to your Petitioners: <HI>First,</HI> in that it has induced Men, to the great Damage of your Petitioners, to wear their Hats upon their Heads, by which Means the said Hats last much longer whole than they would do if worn under their Arms. <HI>Secondly,</HI> in that very often a new Dressing and a new Lace supply the Place of a new Hat, which Grievance we are chiefly sensible of in the Spring-time, when the Com∣pany is leaving the Town; it so happening commonly, that a Hat shall frequent all Winter the finest and best Assemblies without any Or∣naments at all, and in <HI>May</HI> shall be tricked up with Gold or Silver to keep Company with Ru∣sticks, and ride in the Rain.</P>
<P>All which Premisses your Petitioners humbly pray you to take into your Consideration, and either to appoint a Day in your <HI>Court of Honour,</HI> when all Pretenders to the Galloon may enter their Claims, and have them approved or re∣jected, or to give us such other Relief as to your great Wisdom shall seem meet.</P>

To which it was answered, That he was no Lawyer but a Clergyman. Upon a Wager of a Pot of Coffee we overtook him and your Petitioner was soon convinced she had lost.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner therefore desires your Wor∣ship to cite the Clergyman before you, and to settle and adjust the Length of Canonical Peri∣wigs, and the Quantity of Powder to be made use of in them, and to give such other Di∣rections as you shall think fit.</P>

<P>Q. <HI>Whether this Gentleman be not Chaplain to a Regiment, and in such Case allow Powder accor∣dingly?</HI></P>
<P>After all that can be thought on these Subjects, I must confess, That the Men who dress with a certain Ambition to appear more than they are, are much more excusable than those who betray, in the ado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing their Persons, a secret Vanity and Inclination to shine in Things, wherein if they did succeed, it would rather lessen than advance their Character. For this Reason I am more provoked at the Allegations relating to the Clergyman, than any other hinted at in these Complaints. I have indeed a long Time with much Concern observed abundance of <HI>Pretty Fellows</HI> in Sacred
<PB N="363" REF="373"/>
Orders, and shall in due Time let them know, that I pretend to give <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> as well as <HI>Ci∣vil</HI> Censures. A Man well bred and well dressed in that Habit, adds to the Sacredness of his Fun∣ction and Agreeableness not to be met with a∣mong the Laity. I own I have spent some Even∣ings among the Men of Wit of that Profession with an inexpressible Delight. Their habitual Care of their Character gives such a Chastise∣ment to their Fancy, that all which they utter in Company is as much above what you meet with in other Conversations, as the Charms of a mo∣dest are superior to those of a light Woman. I therefore earnestly desire our young Missionaries from the Universities to consider where they are, and not dress, and look, and move like young Officers. It is no Disadvantage to have a very handsome white Hand; but were I to preach Re∣pentance to a Gallery of Ladies, I would, me∣thinks, keep my Gloves on. I have an unfeign∣ed Affection to the Class of Mankind appointed to serve at the Altar, therefore am in Danger of running out of my Way, and growing too serious on this Occasion; for which Reason I shall end with the following Epistle, which, by my Interest in <HI>Tom.

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<P>THE Printer having informed me, That there are as many of these Papers printed as will make Four Volumes, I am now come to the End of my Ambition in this Matter, and have no∣thing further to say to the World, under the Cha∣racter of <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff.</HI> This Work has indeed for some Time been disagreeable to me, and the Purpose of it wholly lost by my being so long un∣derstood as the Author. I never designed in it to give any Man any secret Wound by my Conceal∣ment, but spoke in the Character of an old Man, a Philosopher, an Humorist, an Astrologer, and a Censor, to allure my Reader with the Variety of my Subjects, and insinuate, if I could, the Weight of Reason with the Agreeableness of Wit. The general Purpose of the whole has been to recommend Truth, Innocence, Honour, and Virtue, as the chief Ornaments of Life; but I considered, that Severity of Manners was abso∣lutely necessary to him who would censure others, and for that Reason, and that only, chose to talk in a Mask. I shall not carry my Humility so far as to call my self a vicious Man; but at the same Time must confess, my Life is at best but pardonable. And with no greater Character
<PB N="365" REF="375"/>
than this, a Man would make but an indifferent Progress in attacking prevailing and fashionable Vices, which Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> has done with a Free∣dom of Spirit that would have lost both its Beau∣ty and Efficacy, had it been pretended to by Mr. <HI>Steele.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Work it self, the Acceptance it has met with is the best Proof of its Value; but I should err against that Candour which an honest Man should always carry about him, if I did not own, that the most approved Pieces in it were written by others, and those which have been most excepted against by my self. The Hand that has assisted me in those noble Discourses up∣on the Immortality of the Soul, the glorious Pro∣spects of another Life, and the most sublime Idea's of Religion and Virtue, is a Person who is too fondly my Friend ever to own them; but I should little deserve to be his, if I usurped the Glory of them. I must acknowledge at the same Time, that I think the finest Strokes of Wit and Humour in all Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI>'s Lucubra∣tions are those for which he is also beholden to him.</P>
<P>As for the Satyrical Parts of these Writings, those against the Gentlemen who profess Gaming are the most licentious; but the main of them I take to come from losing Gamesters, as Invectives against the Fortunate; for in very many of them, I was very little else but the Transcriber. If any have been more particularly marked at, such Persons may impute it to their own Behaviour, (before they were touched upon) in publickly speaking their Resentment against the Author, and professing they would support any Man who should insult him. When I mention this Sub∣ject, I hope Major-General <HI>Davenport,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Bisset,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Forbes,</HI> will accept of my Thanks for their frequent good Offices, in pro∣fessing their Readiness to partake any Danger
<PB N="366" REF="376"/>
that should befal me in so just an Undertaking as the Endeavour to banish Fraud and Couze∣nage from the Presence and Conversation of Gentlemen.</P>
<P>But what I find is the least excusable Part of all this Work is, That I have, in some Places in it, touched upon Matters which concern both the Church and State. All I shall say for this is, That the Points I alluded to are such as concern∣ed every Christian and Freeholder in <HI>England;</HI> and I could not be cold enough to conceal my Opinion on Subjects which related to either of those Characters. But Politicks apart. I must confess, it has been a most exquisite Pleasure to me to frame Characters of Domestick Life, and put those Parts of it which are least observed in∣to an agreeable View; to enquire into the Seeds of Vanity and Affectation, to lay before my Rea∣ders the Emptiness of Ambition: In a Word, to trace Humane Life through all its Mazes and Recesses, and show much shorter Methods than Men ordinarily practise, to be happy, agreeable, and great.</P>
<P>But to enquire into Men's Faults and Weak∣nesses has something in it so unwelcome, that I have often seen People in Pain to act before me, whose Modesty only make them think them∣selves liable to Censure. This, and a Thousand other nameless Things, have made it an irksome Task to me to personate Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> any lon∣ger; and I believe it does not often happen, that the Reader is delighted where the Author is dis∣pleased.</P>
<P>All I can now do for the further Gratification of the Town, is to give them a faithful Index and Explication of Passages and Allusions, and sometimes of Persons intended in the several scattered Parts of the Work. At the same Time, the succeeding Volumes shall discover which of the whole have been written by me, and which
<PB N="367" REF="377"/>
by others, and by whom, as far as I am able, or permitted.</P>
<P>Thus I have voluntarily done what I think all Authors should do when call'd upon. I have published my Name to my Writings, and given my self up to the Mercy of the Town (as <HI>Shake∣spear</HI> expresses it) with all my Imperfections on my Head. The indulgent Readers</P>
