<L>GRAVE Prospero, who charm'd in days of yore,</L>
<L>Was deeply read in magick's wond'rous lore;</L>
<L>Could call forth spirits from the vasty deep,</L>
<L>And their dread power in strong subjection keep;</L>
<L>Marshal the dapper elves, and fairies trim,</L>
<L>By moonlight sporting near the fountain-brim;</L>
<L>In spell-bound service airy forms enroll,</L>
<L>Who ride the rainbow, glance from pole to pole;</L>
<L>And fiends of fire, more fervid than the sun,</L>
<L>Through realms of thrilling ice compel to run:</L>
<L>Wielded Jove's bolt, bade cloud-capt mountains quake,</L>
<L>And the great globe unto its center shake;</L>
<L>Commanding the rude surge to dash the skies,</L>
<L>From their dark beds of clay the dead arise!</L>
<L>What could he not, whom such a Master drew?</L>
<L>To Nature, in his boldest fictions, true!</L>
<L>Whose Ariel, Caliban, ghosts, witches, elves,</L>
<L>Seem Nature's children nearly as ourselves!</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>But what can the weak Prospero of these scenes,</L>
<L>Divested of all wonder-working means?</L>
<L>Pity, kind Reader! the rude lack of skill</L>
<L>Which traced the potent Sage with feeble quill!</L>
<L>Nor grieve, benignant Spirit! in thy sphere,</L>
<L>Sweet Shakspeare! to my heart of heart most dear!</L>
<L>That e'en the humblest of the scenick train</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOATSWAIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>YARE! yare!—bear a hand with that stow∣age; here's a fresh breeze sprung up, and as fair for Italy as heart can wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRINCULO.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where's the wonder o'that?—did not the fairy promise old grey-beard as much?—and your true fairies are no courtiers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOATSWAIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fairy promise?—why, what a plague, are we to be puff'd along by the devil and his imps! I don't know what to make of this conjuration! and as for duke Prospero, I'm a lubber if I think him a jot better than an old wizard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRINCULO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Between ourselves, boatswain, I take him to be a kind of friar Bacon, or doctor Faustus; that I heard so many tales about, in England: and like them, he has sold himself to the devil in the next world, that he may be able to play
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>the devil in this: which he did, with a ven∣geance, when he wreck'd us on this isle of devils!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Sudden darkness.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOATSWAIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Avast!—I wish he be not at some of his dia∣bolical tricks again!—'twas as clear a morn as ever shone but now; and, lo! on a sudden, how it is overcast!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Lightning, Thunder, Wind, &amp;c.</STAGE>
<L>And see!—and hark!—heigh, how it rumbles!</L>

<L>Stephano in a parlous taking.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEPHANO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, oh, oh! deliver me from such a sight again!—boatswain! Trinculo! I have been so scared!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOATSWAIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>With what, I trow?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEPHANO.</SPEAKER>
<P>The conjuring duke has been sinking his necromancy-book to the bottom of the red-sea
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>here—it can be no other!—breaking his magi∣cal-stick, and burying it half-way to Belzebub; which has caused such a clatter among the ele∣ments, that I thought dooms-day was come, at least!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOATSWAIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm no seaman, if I relish this same witch∣craft!—and the old magick-monger is going aboard too!—I wish we get safe to port!—I doubt it:—I'd as lief sail with a corpse as a con∣juror!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRINCULO.</SPEAKER>
<P>By'r lady, boatswain, I'm of your mind! I shall never dare to walk the deck after dark, Stephano, much less keep watch there all night, as he once said we should, for dread of spirits, and hobgoblins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEPHANO.</SPEAKER>
<P>The bare thought of it gives me the shaking palsy, fellow Trinculo!—he were fitter to watch o'nights himself, and let servant-monster be his mate: then, if any goblins should board us, they could gibber with them in their own infernal dialect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOATSWAIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>He don't intend, I hope, to take that land∣shark
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>aboard;—an' he do not keep him in an iron cage, he'll devour all the ship's provisions, and tear us to pieces for more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRINCULO,</SPEAKER>
<P>Who? Caliban? not he, o'my troth!—though he be a monster, he's a tame one; and no glut∣ton neither:—give him but the bottle, you stop his mouth at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEPHANO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you talk of the bottle, Trinculo, I think a sup of it would do me no harm, after the pa∣nick I have been in; what say ye to some sack, boys, before we set sail?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRINCULO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and after too; for I quake horribly with apprehension.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEPHANO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Follow, then; — the rock, my wine-cellar, is in our way to where the ship rides: and our word shall be, no night-watching! for fear of spirits and hobgoblins!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRINCULO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, spirits and hobgoblins!—'mercy on us! say I, and send us all safe to Naples!</P>

<P>Go thy ways for a blood-thirsty, and most monstrous monster! when I was pot-valiant once, indeed, I had some notion of knocking out the old conjuror's brains myself;—but, now that
<PB N="95" REF="83"/>I am sober, I can't bear the thought of murder! no, not even manslaughter! so, that I may n't be an accessary, I'll e'en go look after our ship, the fury said was o' fire; and, if it be not burnt, get aboard again, as fast as I can paddle the boat, or oar myself to it!</P>

<P>Every stick and thread of it! as we were go∣ing aboard, to wash down our wild breakfast with a draught of sack; not being able to find the boat again, we waited 'till the tide should ebb, and leave the ship aground; which it had no sooner done, than a legion of devils slew over our heads, set fire to her, and, in a moment, tore her all to pieces, like a handful of lighted flax!</P>

<SPEAKER>STEPHANO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mayhap they'll make lighted flax of us next!— what a villainous voyage we have made on't!— my wine is all gone,—I am dry as tinder, and shall burn like touchwood! this is all owing to the duke's drowning his magical book, and breaking his conjuring stick:—if he had but them, safe and sound, he'd be a match for the old-one himself!</P>
