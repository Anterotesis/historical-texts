REMARKS ON THE Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Six∣teenth Verses of the Seventh Chapter of ISAIAH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Hear ye now, O house of David, is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign, Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS text has in all ages of Christianity been esteemed a clear and certain predic∣tion of the miraculous birth of Christ; and therefore these remarks upon it would have been superfluous, had not a learned and ingenious gentleman lately attempted to prove a contrary
<PB N="4" REF="5" MS="y"/>
doctrine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Critical Dissertation on Isaiah vii. 13, 14, 15, 16.</NOTE>; viz. <Q>That the prophet <HI>(in this text)</HI> had no reference to the Messiah <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 44.</NOTE>.</Q> That <Q>the words of Isaiah prove only that a young woman should conceive and bring forth a son, without in∣timating any thing miraculous in her conception,</Q> &amp;c. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 21.</NOTE> That <Q>from the most careful and impartial examination, the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>(here translated a virgin)</HI> doth not appear to signify strictly a virgin;</Q> but that <Q>it seems to mean a young woman in gene∣ral, without specifying particularly, whether she is a virgin or not <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 23.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>This writer is not singular in his notions, for the authors of the Critical Review have publicly pro∣fessed themselves of the same opinion concerning this prophecy (see N<SUP>o</SUP> 136, fo. 349.)— <Q>The most obvious and natural explication <HI>(say they)</HI> is this which Dr. W—ms <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The author of a Concordance to the Greek Testament.</NOTE> has adopted,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I do not find that they have objected to a single part of the Doctor's work; and therefore this pub∣lic declaration certainly makes them parties to the whole: nay, perhaps I may say with justice, that they are more concerned in publishing these notions to the world, even than the <HI>anonymous author</HI> him∣self; for instead of giving a short extracted ac∣count
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
of the work as usual, they seem to have co∣pied the whole, almost at length, scarcely omitting a single circumstance.</P>
<P>Now I must acknowledge, in justice to Dr. W—ms, that I think he has set forth his hypo∣thesis to all the advantage that it is capable of; nevertheless, he does not make it appear that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in any other place of the Old Testa∣ment where it occurs, must <HI>necessarily</HI> signify a young woman that was <HI>not</HI> a virgin; without which proof the common acceptation of the sign pro∣mised by Isaiah cannot with justice be rejected; especially as a virgin did afterwards conceive, and bear a son; a miracle which never happened before or since the birth of Christ! therefore it was cer∣tainly a sign worthy of that great and wonderful event; and, from that time to this, has by all Christians (except the author of the Critical Disser∣tation and the authors of the Critical Review <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. W—ms has since informed me of <HI>one other wri∣ter</HI> of the same opinion concerning this passage; (viz. the author of <HI>"The Assembly's Confession of Faith examined,"</HI> printed in 1651.) but at the same time he acknowledges that this authority was not known, even to himself, until <HI>"several months after the Dissertation was published:"</HI> and he declares concerning his own sentiments of the passage, that he apprehended them <HI>"altogether new,"</HI> when he wrote, <Q>for <HI>(says he)</HI> I did not then know that any Chris∣tian writer had so explained it.</Q></NOTE>)
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
been esteemed the completion of the said pro∣phecy.</P>
<P>Dr. W—ms observes that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> occurs only seven times in all; and therefore, I hope, it will not take up too much of my readers time, if I attempt to examine the context of these several places, in order to ascertain the true sense of the word.</P>
<P>The text wherein the signification of this word is esteemed the most doubtful, is in Prov. xxx. 19. where Solomon mentions four things that were too hard for him; in which number (according to the English translation) he includes <Q>the way of a man with a maid.</Q>
The sense of this passage is very different according to the Syriac version, wherein <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is rendered <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>in his youth,</HI> viz. the way of a man <HI>"in his youth,"</HI> and not <HI>"with a maid,"</HI> as in the English version. Like∣wise the Latin vulgate, as well as the old Latin version of St. Jerome, conform in some degree to the Syriac, though not intirely; for they construe it <HI>in adolescentia</HI> (not in adolescentia <HI>ejus</HI>) which is sufficiently clear without having recourse to Dr. Kennicott's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his sermon preached before the university of Ox∣ford in 1765.—Note 8, page 46.</NOTE> expedient of supposing a corruption in the present Heb. text to enable him to read <Q>in his youth;</Q> as if it had been wrote originally <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>Nevertheless, it appears to me that the common English translation of this passage is to be preferred, and that the word must here necessarily signify a <HI>maid</HI> or <HI>virgin:</HI> for the writer seems to allude to the secret artifices and allurements used by a man in order to seduce a virgin; such <HI>artifices</HI> as are hinted at in Exodus xxii. 16. (—<Q>And if a man <HI>entice</HI> a <HI>maid,</HI></Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) &amp;c.) therefore a word signifying merely a young woman, or one that was not esteemed a virgin, would not have been so suit∣able to the context of either of these passages. The <HI>way</HI> of a harlot was too well-known in former days, (as well as the present) to be esteemed a mystery; and much less a mystery to Solomon, who had <Q>threescore queens, <HI>fourscore concubines,</HI> and vir∣gins without number.</Q> (See Canticles vi. 8.) But it is not at all unnatural to suppose that this eastern monarch, with all his wisdom, might sometimes be perplexed with doubts and jealousies concerning the virtue and private conduct of some of those females (as well virgins as others) with respect to other men: this, it seems, was by him esteemed as diffi∣cult to be traced as the way of a ship in the sea, an eagle in the air, &amp;c. By the sin of the adulte∣rous woman (to which the preceding similies allude as being equally uninvestigable <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Such</HI> is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wicked∣ness. Prov. xxx. 20.</NOTE>) Solomon repre∣sents
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
the great difficulty of detecting the inconstancy of any particular persons in the two former classes; I mean his queens and concubines; and he would not find it less difficult (for some time at least) to trace out the <HI>way</HI> (or behaviour) of private admi∣rers towards the third class of his women, that were esteemed <HI>virgins</HI> in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this I must observe, that the strictness of the law of Moses rendered the ob∣servance of secrecy absolutely necessary to offenders in this way: for, if a man was found guilty of <HI>se∣ducing a virgin</HI> (see Exodus xxii. 16.) he was obli∣ged not only to pay a heavy fine to the young wo∣man's father, and to take her for his wife, but was likewise deprived of an indulgence, which, of all others, seemed most agreeable to the libidinous disposition of the Jews at that time; and was al∣lowed them by Moses only on account <HI>of the hard∣ness of their hearts;</HI> (see Matthew xix. 8.) I mean <HI>the giving a bill of divorce;</HI> for, in this case (when a man was obliged to marry one whom he had se∣duced) he might <HI>not put her away all his days.</HI> (See Deut. xxii. 28.)—A punishment of greater morti∣fication to the Jews than any other, which the learned Philo (though himself a Jew) candidly ac∣knowledges <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Fol. 789. Paris Edition, 1640.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10"/>This certainly was a sufficient cause for secrecy on the man's part; so that, whether <HI>his way</HI> (or behaviour) <HI>with a maid</HI> was really criminal, or only imprudent (for either of them may be implied in the text) he would, as much as possible, conceal it from the world, and render it as <HI>uninvestigable</HI> as the other things mentioned in the text to be too wonderful for Solomon; at least his best endea∣vours would not be wanting to make it so.</P>
<P>Neither can we suppose that the same earnest en∣deavours would be wanting on the young woman's part to conceal her disgrace from her friends as long as she could. But the reasons for secrecy are far more obvious in the case of espoused virgins; for, according to the law of Moses (Deut. xxii. 23, 24.) if a man was base enough to seduce one of these, an ignominious death was to be the immediate and dreadful consequence of a discovery; when both parties must share the same wretched fate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxii. 23, 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now if all that I have said shall not be thought sufficient to prove that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in this passage must necessarily signify a maid or virgin, I have never∣theless the satisfaction of observing that the author of the objections, in page 20, allows it to be <Q>a very obscure passage;</Q> and professes to <Q>lay no stress upon it;</Q> and therefore, I think, I may safely conclude, at least, that it is incapable of
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
proving any thing against the true sense of the word in the other passages.</P>
<P>The same author observes in page 19, that "other <HI>four places are absolutely uncertain;</HI>" but they appear in a very different light to me.</P>
<P>In the first of these places (Genesis xxiv. 43.) the word is applied to Rebekah before her mar∣riage, who in the same chapter is said expresly to be a <HI>virgin</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <Q>neither had any man known her.</Q> (See 16th verse.)</P>
<P>In the second place (Exodus ii. 8.) it is applied to Moses's sister, who watched her infant brother during the time of his being exposed in the little ark of bulrushes.</P>
<P>Now it does not appear that Moses had any other sister besides Miriam the prophetess; (see Numb. xxvi. 59. and Exodus xv. 20.) and why her chas∣tity should be called in question (especially so early in life) I know not!</P>
<P>In the third place (Psalm lxviii. 25.) this word with the context expresses the damsels playing with timbrels in the solemn processions of the sanctuary; who, had they been damsels suspected of having <HI>"wrought folly in Israel,"</HI> (Deut. xxii. 21. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">—<Q>that she die: because she <HI>hath wrought folly in Israel,</HI> to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.</Q></NOTE>) they, surely, would not have been permitted to join in this divine service.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>The last of these four places, which the Doctor thinks <HI>"absolutely uncertain,"</HI> is Canticles i. 3. where the same word is applied to the virgins that waited on Solomon's spouse. But this uncertainty is easily removed by the other passage in Canticles (chap. vi. ver. 8.) where the same word is happily applied to the same persons; who must be under∣stood to be virgins, because (as Dr. W—ms him∣self acknowledges in page 29 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">— <Q>I shall here add further, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> occurs only seven times in all; one of which has the appearance of <HI>being decisive in the case,</HI> namely, Canticles vi. 8. where virgins <HI>are distinguished from queens and concubines.</HI> But this distinction is no proof at all, because, the same; in∣deed, a stronger distinction is made, Ezek. xliv. 22. in favour of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q></NOTE>) they <Q>are distin∣guished from queens and concubines.</Q></P>
<P>This one would suppose to be an insurmountable obstacle to the Doctor's argument; but he passes very slightly over the difficulty, and contents him∣self with informing us, that <Q><HI>this distinction</HI> is no proof at all, because, the same; indeed, a stronger distinction is made, Ezek. <HI>xliv. 22.</HI> in favour of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q></P>
<P>Now I hope the Doctor will excuse my want of discernment in not being able to discover <HI>the weight of this reason</HI> against so strong a proof, as the dis∣tinction in question; because, if <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is proved,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
ever so clearly, to signify strictly <HI>a virgin</HI> (and in∣deed I know no reason why any person should doubt of it) yet it is no argument why the other may not <HI>likewise signify the same thing;</HI> for the word <HI>maid,</HI> by having this signification in English, does not oblige us to give a different signification to the English word <HI>virgin:</HI> therefore I think I may safely conclude in the Doctor's own words, that this last text <Q>has the appearance of being decisive in the case;</Q> (see page 29.) and that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> cannot signify a young woman that is not a virgin, because, by the same word in the plural number (according to the author's own observation) <Q>vir∣gins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The ingenious author of the new translation of Solo∣mon's Song observes in his annotations, p. 69, that <Q>the Jewish maidens before marriage were under such strict confinement, and so rarely suffered to appear in public, that the very name for a virgin in Hebrew is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> hidden.</Q></P>
<P>This word is well explained by the learned Stockins, p. 820.</P>
<P N="1">"(1.) <HI>Generatim</HI> &amp; <HI>vi originis</HI> notat <HI>latentem.</HI>"</P>
<P N="2"><Q>(2.) <HI>Speciatim (a) proprie</HI> notat <HI>virginem,</HI> quae domi latitat &amp; continetur, nec adhuc cum quoquam rem habuit. Ita dicitur de Rebecca, nondum propalam nuptam educta, Gen. xxiv. de Mirjam, quae nondum rem cum quoquam habuerat, Ex. ii. 8. de puella incorrupta &amp; illibata, cui vir insidiatur, ut ea potiatur, Prov. xxx. 19. de matre Immanuelis illibata &amp; concubitus ignara, Jes. vii. 14.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>I propose now to examine whether we may safely acquiesce with the author of the Critical Disserta∣tion, fo. 44. and the authors of the Critical Review (No 136, fo. 359.) in their opinion, that Isaiah in his prophecy concerning Immanuel, in the seventh chapter, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th verses, <Q>had no reference to the Messiah.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. W—ms objects (in page 9.) that the 16th verse of the seventh chapter of Isaiah <Q>cannot, in any sense, be applied to the Messiah.</Q> The words of this text, according to the English translation, are as follows: <Q>For before <HI>the child shall</HI> know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</Q></P>
<P>This verse seems to be the principal cause of his objections against the common interpretation of the two preceding verses.</P>
<P>Now, though I do not think with him that these three verses <HI>must, of necessity, relate</HI> to the same per∣son; yet I apprehend there is a great probability
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
that <HI>they may;</HI> and that the 16th verse may reason∣ably be accounted for, even when applied to the Messiah. Dr. W—ms approves of the meaning given to the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the 16th verse by Mr. Mann (viz. that it may signify <HI>"vexest"</HI> instead of <HI>abhorrest</HI>) <Q>the land which thou (Ahaz) <HI>vexest</HI> with thy idolatry.</Q> (See fo. 34.) Thus far he favours the explication which I propose to give of this passage; but then he supposes that <HI>the land which Ahaz vexed</HI> signifies the land of Judah <HI>only.</HI> <Q><HI>The prophet meant</HI> to say, according to this au∣thor (says the Doctor) that the land <HI>of Judah,</HI> which Ahaz by his idolatry and wickedness had brought into trouble and difficulty, should be delivered from <HI>both these kings:</HI></Q> (fo. 35.) by which the Doctor refers to <HI>Resin</HI> king of Syria, and <HI>Pekah</HI> the son of Remaliah king of Israel, who at that time were confederate against <HI>Judah,</HI> and <Q>went up towards Jerusalem to war against it.</Q> See the first part of the same chapter.—The Doctor repeats the same thing in page 37—viz.—the land <HI>(of Ju∣dah)</HI> which thou (Ahaz) vexest, &amp;c. This throws great difficulty upon the text, which informs us, that the land which Ahaz vexed should <Q>be for∣saken of both <HI>her kings.</HI></Q> The construction of the word rendered <HI>"her kings"</HI> requires us to un∣derstand that both the kings there spoken of should be kings of that land which Ahaz vexed: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>"both her kings."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>Now <HI>Pekah king of Israel</HI> cannot be understood to be one of these, if the land, which Ahaz vexed, signified the land of Judah alone; for in what sense could he be called one of the kings of the <HI>land of Judah,</HI> who was not a conqueror (for the true king still maintained his royal seat and title) but a de∣clared enemy and disturber, and <HI>king only of Is∣rael?</HI></P>
<P>Neither could Resin king of Syria be properly said to be either king of Judah or Israel; for he was only an invader of Judah, acting as an ally to the king of Israel.</P>
<P>Though indeed he had rather more right to be accounted one of <HI>the kings of Judah,</HI> than the king of Israel had, because about that time he had taken possession of <HI>Elath, a city of Judah:</HI> but this could not really intitle him to be called a king of that land, because, from the time that the city was ta∣ken, it ceased to be a part of <HI>Judah,</HI> and was ac∣counted a part of the <HI>kingdom of Syria;</HI> for it is expresly said in 2 Kings xvi. 6. that <Q>Resin king of Syria <HI>recovered Elath</HI> to Syria, <HI>and</HI> drave the Jews from <HI>Elath: and the</HI> Syrians <HI>came to Elath, and</HI> dwelt there unto this day.</Q> Dr. W—ms observes in a note (page 37.) that <Q>Resin and Pekah are, perhaps, here called the kings of Judah, because they were then in possession of all the country, Jerusalem excepted;</Q> but the Doctor surely did not consider, that Isaiah was sent to confirm Ahaz,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
that he should not fear <Q>the two tails of these smoking firebrands</Q> (viz. Resin and the son of Remaliah) and to assure him, that their evil council of <HI>setting up a king in Judah should "not stand"</HI>— nor—<HI>"come to pass."</HI> It is not likely therefore, that the prophet should call either or both of these kings <HI>kings of Judah,</HI> because it would have been absolutely a contradiction to his message, which was to encourage and establish <HI>the then reigning king of Judah,</HI> descended from the house of David. Even the Doctor himself seems so sensible of the insufficiency of his interpretation, that he after∣wards, in the same note, proposes another expe∣dient (though a dangerous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Thus it happens with these sacred books as with prophane authors, that when the <HI>medica manus critico∣rum</HI> is to perform an operation upon the text, it is often dislocated and maimed, and rendered almost incurable by improper applications. But whatever may be done with the historical books, we have no right to indulge any conjectural emendations in the prophecies: it looks too much like tampering with evidence. If they are faulty, they must even remain so; and we must take the evidence as it comes to us.</Q> <BIBL>Dr. Gregory Sharpe's 2d Argument in Defence of Christianity, p. 265.</BIBL></NOTE> one) in hopes of solv∣ing the difficulty; for the text not being capable of serving his purpose as it stands at present, the pro∣phet himself must be corrected.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>This is esteemed a much easier thing, now-a-days, than for a critic to give up a favorite opinion, that happens to be contradictory to the Holy Scripture.</P>
<P><Q>Suppose (says the Doctor) that we should read <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>her kings? shall be forsaken of both kings</HI></Q> —this, indeed, is cutting the knot, but it will not enable the Doctor to come off con∣queror, like the Grecian hero. If the omission of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the Septuagint translation should even be allowed to afford sufficient grounds for such a supposition; yet <Q>Dr. Kennicott's truly important work</Q> is not likely to furnish various readings from MSS. equal in authority and antiquity with those from which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theo∣dotion were taken. These were, manifestly, accord∣ing to the present Heb. text in this passage; for it is rendered by all these translators <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, of <HI>her</HI> two kings, or of both <HI>her</HI> kings.</P>
<P>The ancient Syriac version, likewise, confirms the text; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>both her kings.</HI> It would have been time enough to have quoted Dr. Kenni∣cott's various reading, when it was known that any such subsisted—for it is not fair dealing to wound the credit of the holy text with a mere <HI>"perhaps,"</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Dr. Kennicott's truly important work may, <HI>perhaps,</HI> hereafter <HI>strengthen this conjecture.</HI></Q> In a note, fo. 37.</NOTE> and for no other purpose (if I may use the Dr's
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
own words) than to <HI>"strengthen</HI> a <HI>conjecture."</HI> In short, I would advise the Doctor to let the text re∣main as he found it, for this unjustifiable method of solving difficulties is a broken reed, which sel∣dom fails to wound the hands of those who use it.</P>
<P>Now the difficulty ceases, if it be admitted that the <HI>land which Ahaz vexed</HI> signified the land or in∣heritance of the twelve tribes of Israel, including Judah; which construction the circumstances of those times will enable it to bear.</P>
<P>Ahaz had interrupted the sacrifices of atonement usually offered up for <HI>all Israel</HI> in the temple at Jerusalem, which was common to Jews and Israe∣lites; and therefore might truly be said to <HI>vex</HI> the land of Israel, as well as Judah: for he not only <HI>"sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus"</HI> (2 Chron. xxviii. 23.) but he <Q>cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and <HI>shut up the doors of the house of the Lord</HI></Q> (24th verse). King Heze∣kiah <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 2 Chron. xxix.</NOTE> (who opened again the doors of the house of the Lord, and caused the priests and Levites to cleanse all the house from the abominations of Ahaz) was conscious that his father, by the inter∣ruption of divine service before-mentioned, had <HI>vexed Israel</HI> as well as Judah; and therefore made all the amends that lay in his power. He caused <HI>"an atonement"</HI> to be made <HI>"for all Israel:"</HI> for
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
the king <Q>commanded, that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be <HI>made for all Israel.</HI></Q> 2 Chron. xxix. 24.</P>
<P>He likewise <Q>sent to <HI>all Israel</HI> and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the Lord God <HI>of Israel.</HI></Q> 2 Chron. xxx. 1. And we read in the 11th verse of the same chapter, that <Q>divers of Asher and Manasseh, and of Zebulun, hum∣bled themselves (accordingly) and came to Je∣rusalem;</Q> and <HI>"did eat the passover."</HI> (See 18th verse.) Now as it appears that the <HI>land of all the other tribes,</HI> as well as the <HI>land of Judah,</HI> was really vexed by the apostasy of Ahaz, there is reason to suppose that <HI>the land of Immanuel,</HI> mentioned by Isaiah (viii. 8.) might signify (not only <HI>the land of Judah,</HI> but) the land of <HI>both the houses</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, mentioned in the 14th verse of the same chapter; and that the <HI>two kings</HI> of the land, mentioned in the seventh chapter, may mean the kings, or <HI>separate regal powers,</HI> of these two houses of Israel, which were <HI>both to cease before the child</HI> (Immanuel) <HI>should know to refuse the evil and choose the good.</HI> The word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or king, in a figu∣rative way of speaking, may very well be under∣stood in some passages (not to mean merely the person of one particular king, but in a more gene∣ral sense) to signify <HI>a succession of kings,</HI> or rather <HI>the
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
regal constitution of a state;</HI> and the failure of such royalty in some cases serves as a distinguishing mark of conquest or subjection to a foreign power. <Q>The king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited,</Q> says the prophet Zechariah, (ix. 5.) by which is plainly understood (not the de∣struction of a single king, but) the ceasing of the regal government of the city of Gaza. It is a sy∣nonimous term with the <HI>departing of the sceptre:</HI> <Q>The pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and <HI>the sceptre of Egypt</HI> shall depart away,</Q> says the same prophet in the 11th verse of the succeeding chapter. The prophet Hosea, likewise, uses the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the same general sense (xi. 5.) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—"the Assyrian (or Assur) shall be his king:" <HI>one Assyrian king only</HI> cannot here be meant; but the succession of kings reigning in Assyria during the captivity of Israel. Therefore, I presume, there is some ground for my supposition, that Isaiah's ex∣pression in the seventh chapter, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, may signify <HI>the two separate regal governments</HI> of Judah and Israel (called, in the twenty-third chapter of Ezechiel, Aholah and Aholibah) and not merely two single kings.</P>
<P>When I first wrote this opinion, and communi∣cated the MS. to Dr. W—ms, I apprehended that the thought was intirely new;—so little am I ac∣quainted with the republic of letters, for want of leisure and opportunity to read! I must therefore
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
acknowledge myself obliged to Dr. W—ms for his information, that the learned Mr. Mann, in his dissertation De anno natali Christi, <Q>appears to be of the same opinion.</Q> I had likewise the satisfac∣tion, afterwards, to be informed by another gen∣tleman (a worthy friend of mine) that the same in∣terpretation is recommended in the Universal Hist. vol. IV. of the Octavo, p. 154, with the note K.</P>
<P>Now, that the opinion of the learned author may more clearly be understood, I will set down at length the whole that he wrote upon the text in question.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the subject of Isaiah's mes∣sage to Ahaz, he adds— <Q>Here the king, whe∣ther out of respect or despondency and unbelief, —refusing to ask the promised sign, the prophet assured him from the Lord, that—before <HI>that time</HI> came, a virgin should conceive and bear a son, and call his name Himmanuel, or God with us; and so on.</Q> (K).</P>
<P>Upon this opinion he further explains himself in the following note:</P>
<P><Q>(K) This we take to be a much more natural sense of that prophecy than to suppose, as some have done, that such a miraculous child was really born in Ahaz's time, to assure him of the promised deliverance; for as there is not the least mention of such an extraordinary birth, so neither do we see that there was any necessity for
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
it, in order to convince the desponding king, who could not be ignorant of that prophecy of Jacob, that the sceptre should not depart from Judah, till Shiloh was come, much less, that he was to spring of the lineage of David. But what staggered Ahaz's faith, and made him fear that the regal power was going to depart from his family, was, that his two enemies had combined to set a stranger on his throne. All, therefore, that was wanting to dispel his present fears about it, was for the prophet to assure him from God, that this Shiloh, promised to Judah and David, who was to fore-run the total excision of the Jewish polity, was to be born in a miraculous manner and with a divine character, and other remarkable circumstances, such as, he might be easily satisfied, had not as yet happened in his kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As for that part of the prophecy which is com∣monly urged on the other side, namely, <Q>Before this wonderful child shall know good from evil, the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings:</Q> We think, that if it be rightly un∣derstood, it will rather confirm our sense of the prophecy, and that the words ought to be thus rendered. For (or rather, as the particle <HI>chi</HI> seems to import here, nay) before this child can know good from evil, this land, which thou (not abhorrest, as our version renders it, but) art so
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
solicitous about, or givest up for lost, shall be bereaved of both her kings; by which, we think, ought to be understood, not the kings of Syria and Israel, for the former could not be called her (Canaan's) king; and the latter had but a share in it at best; <HI>but the kings of Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> as it really was before the coming of the Messiah.</Q></P>
<P>In order to confirm this opinion, I have annexed to these remarks two distinct dissertations: one on the prophecy of Isaiah vii. 8. (—<Q>and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be bro∣ken that it be not a people</Q>); and the other on the famous prophecy of Jacob, concerning the sceptre of Judah.</P>
<P>In the former I shew, that the <HI>regal government</HI> of the <HI>house of Israel,</HI> as a separate state from Ju∣dah, was put an end to not a great many years after Isaiah's prophecy.</P>
<P>In the latter (I hope) I have proved that the re∣gal government of the house of Judah (I mean only the temporal or worldly kingdom of Judah) ceased precisely at the time limited by Isaiah in the prophecy now before us. So that, I flatter myself, it will appear upon the whole, that the land of Is∣rael, including Judah (being the land which Ahaz <HI>vexed</HI>) was forsaken of <HI>"both her kings,"</HI> or regal governments, before the child Immanuel could <HI>"know to refuse the evil and choose the good."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>For Herod the Great, on a careful examination (I believe) will be found to have been the last king of <HI>the whole land</HI> of <HI>Israel and Judah,</HI> which Ahaz <HI>vexed;</HI> and it is remarkable, that Christ, the true Immanuel, <HI>was a young child in the arms of his mother</HI> at the time of this monarch's death; soon after which, Joseph, the husband of the blessed vir∣gin, was warned by an angel of the Lord in Egypt, saying, <Q>Arise, and take THE YOUNG CHILD and his mother, and go into the <HI>land of Israel</HI></Q> (not the land of <HI>Judah</HI> only) <Q>for they are <HI>dead</HI> which sought the <HI>young child</HI>'s life.</Q> Matth. ii. 20.</P>
<P>But Dr. W—ms in a note (page 32.) observes, that the child Immanuel <Q>could not be Christ, <HI>be∣cause</HI> he is never called the king of Judah.</Q> And he thinks that Nathaniel, when he called him <HI>the king of Israel,</HI> <Q><HI>laboured</HI> under the same mistake with all his countrymen, who expected a tem∣poral Messiah.</Q> The Doctor observes in the same note, that <HI>"Christ is king of the whole earth;"</HI> which he seems to assign as a reason, why <Q>he is never called the king of Judah.</Q></P>
<P>And indeed it does not appear that the Doctor had any other foundation for his censure of Natha∣niel; though this argument is so far from being conclusive in favour of the Doctor's opinion, that it rather proves the contrary; for he that is king of <HI>the whole earth</HI> must necessarily, in a general sense, be king of Israel and Judah; these titles
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
being most certainly included in the former, even supposing the peculiar sceptre of each kingdom to be departed.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the argument (such as it is) is ad∣mitted and approved by the Critical Reviewers! for they quote the Doctor's words at length (see N<SUP>o</SUP> 136, fo. 356.) without offering any thing to jus∣tify Nathaniel from the charge of <HI>labouring under a mistake.</HI></P>
<P>It shall therefore be my business to prove, that the mistake does <HI>not rest with Nathaniel.</HI></P>
<P>Christ is in a peculiar manner eternal king of Judah and Israel, as well as king of the whole earth, and <HI>heir of all things.</HI> (Heb. i. 2.) The angel Ga∣briel testified that Christ should <HI>reign over the house of Jacob (which is Israel)</HI> for ever. See St. Luke i. 32. And the wise men of the East <HI>went to Je∣rusalem</HI> and inquired, <Q>Where is he that <HI>is born king of the Jews?</HI> for we have seen his star in the East, and come</Q> (that is, to Jerusalem, the capital of his kingdom) <HI>"to worship him."</HI> See Matth. ii. 1, 2. Therefore the Doctor's objection that the child Immanuel could not be Christ, <HI>be∣cause he is never called the king of Judah,</HI> seems to be intirely groundless; for the dominion of the land of Immanuel (mentioned in the eighth chapter of Isaiah) may most certainly be attributed with more propriety to the Messiah, who <HI>was king</HI> and <HI>shep∣herd
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
of Israel</HI> (see Ezek. xxxvii. 24. also xxxiv. 23, 24.) than to any son of Isaiah whatever.</P>
<P>Dr. W—ms may, perhaps, suppose, that the king∣doms of Israel and Judah could not belong to Christ, because he refused to accept of any temporal go∣vernment, and withdrew himself when he perceived that the people would come, and take him by force to <HI>make him a king;</HI> (see John vi. 15.) and further, because he even declared that his kingdom was not of this world. See chap. xviii. 36. But all this seems to relate only to the manner of his govern∣ment, which, in general, was merely spiritual. He was nevertheless <HI>king of Israel,</HI> being sent in a par∣ticular manner to the lost sheep of the house of Is∣rael; (see Matth. xv. 24.) and, for a time, Jerusa∣lem was <HI>the seat of his kingdom,</HI> when he went up to the feast; and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way (a greater mark of submission than is ever paid to temporal princes) and others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way (see Matth. xxi. 8.) and cried, <HI>Hosanna, Blessed is the</HI> KING OF ISRAEL that cometh in the name of the Lord. John xii. 13.</P>
<P>Christ did not tell the multitude that they <Q><HI>la∣boured</HI> under a mistake</Q> in calling him KING OF ISRAEL; on the contrary it appears, that he ap∣proved of the voice of the people; which could not have been the case, had he not been really <HI>king of Israel:</HI> for when the pharisees said unto him,
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Master, rebuke thy disciples, he answered and said unto them, <Q><HI>I tell you, that if these should</HI> hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</Q> Luke xix. 38, 39, 40. Thus was the Messiah not only <HI>"called," but proclaimed king of Israel;</HI> and as such he received the homage of his people; yet in such a manner, as best suited the sacred character of him, who had <HI>rejected a worldly kingdom:</HI> for, instead of royal apparel and a triumphal car, he was <HI>"cloathed with humility,"</HI> and sitting on an ass, that the prophecy of Zechariah might be literally fulfilled.</P>
<P><Q>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold THY KING cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salva∣tion, <HI>lowly,</HI> and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</Q> (Zech. ix. 9.) But though Christ professed that his kingdom was not of this world, yet there was no worldly man hardy enough to resist or oppose his will, when he was pleased to exert his divine authority over them; for <Q>he cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money∣changers, and the seats of them that sold doves; and <HI>would not suffer</HI> that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.</Q> Mark xi. 15, 16.</P>
<P>And St. John informs us (chap. ii. 15.) that he made a scourge of small cords, and drove them all (all such as are above-mentioned) out of the temple.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"/>Of all the extraordinary things which Christ did, St. Jerome thought this to be the most wonderful, as Mr. Bragge remarks in his Practical Observations upon the Miracles. This personal authority and do∣minion of Christ <HI>in Israel</HI> was expresly foretold by the prophet Micah (chap. v. 2.) <Q>But thou Beth∣lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that is, to be RULER IN IS∣RAEL; whose goings forth have been from of old <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Wherefore, we ought most certainly to acquit Nathaniel, and other faithful Israelites, of the <HI>mistake</HI> which they have lately been supposed to <HI>"labour under,"</HI> when they declared our Lord Jesus Christ to be <HI>"the king of Israel."</HI> (John i. 49. xii. 13.)</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31"/>Thus far I have ventured to suggest, in answer to Dr. W—ms's declaration in page 9,—that "the 16th verse" (of the seventh chap. of Isaiah) <HI>"cannot, in any sense, be applied to the Messiah:"</HI> I hope I have proved that it may; nevertheless I must observe, that even the common interpretation of this passage is not so unreasonable as Dr. W—ms seems to imagine; though, indeed, the interpreta∣tion before given appears to be much less liable to exception.</P>
<P>The Doctor animadverts severely on the opinion of those who say, that the passage contains two dis∣tinct prophecies;—viz. that the verses 14 and 15 relate to Christ, but the 16th to Isaiah's son. <Q>Is not this <HI>(says he)</HI> very unnatural? and, if I am not mistaken, very unusual?</Q></P>
<P>But the authors of the old commentary on the Bible, commonly called Assemblies Annotations, were of a very different opinion.</P>
<P>They observe on this very text, that <Q><HI>it is an usual thing</HI> in Scripture, with our prophet Isaiah especially, by way of allusion, to apply the same words and phrases unto divers subjects, where occasion is to speak of them together:</Q> and therefore they were of opinion, that the child men∣tioned in the 16th verse was <Q>no other, in all like∣lihood, than Shearjashub, the prophet's child, whom, to this purpose, God hath commanded him to take along with him.</Q> How far this was
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
an usual thing with Isaiah, may be seen even in prophecies which were delivered on the same occa∣sion as the text in question.</P>
<P>For the further illustration of this point, I have added to my book a short dissertation on the nature and style of prophetical writings, shewing, that abrupt transitions from one subject to another are frequently found therein; and that the Holy Scrip∣tures afford many examples of prophecies, which are blended and interwoven with other subjects that are intirely different, both as to the matter and the time of accomplishment.</P>
<P>We must not expect to find all prophecies unat∣tended with difficulties: nevertheless, there are no difficulties in the seventh chapter of Isaiah so great as those, that are occasioned by Dr. W—ms's in∣terpretation of it. <Q>This prophecy (says he) as I take it, relates to <HI>one person only,</HI> and that <HI>was the son of a young woman then present;</HI> which son was afterwards to be born.</Q> See page 4.</P>
<P>Now I may ask with Origen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q></NOTE> (contra Celsum, pag. 28, Cambridge Edition, 1677.)— <Q>Who was born in the time of Ahaz, of whose birth this is
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
said,—Emanuel? <HI>that is,</HI> GOD WITH US? For if no one is found, it is manifest that what was said to Ahaz, was addressed to <HI>the house of</HI> DAVID, according to that which was written;—viz.—of the <HI>seed of David a saviour is born according to the flesh.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Indeed we read, in the eighth chapter, of a son, which the prophetess conceived and bare unto Isaiah; and likewise, that Isaiah was careful to take unto him FAITHFUL WITNESSES TO RECORD con∣cerning him; <Q>for (said he) before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father and my mo∣ther (which must be within two years) the RICHES of DAMASCUS, and the SPOIL of SAMA∣RIA, shall be taken away before the king of As∣syria.</Q> Therefore this child was certainly the TEMPORARY SIGN of the promised deliverance from the <HI>two powers</HI> of DAMASCUS and SAMARIA; but, unfortunately for Dr. W—ms's hypothesis, the said child was NOT CALLED IMMANUEL, but MAHER∣SHALAL-HASH-BAZ, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> properly sig∣nifying and prefiguring the <HI>near approach of the spoiling of Damascus and Samaria.</HI> Now, we do not read of any other child, born at that time, as a sign; and therefore Dr. W—ms's opinion, concerning Immanuel, is not only a <HI>mere supposition,</HI> but a very improbable one; since it is not at all likely, that TWO CHILDREN were then born, one <HI>Maher-shalal-hash-baz,</HI> and the other <HI>Immanuel,</HI> and both of them
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
intended as MERE TEMPORARY SIGNS OF THE SAME THING.</P>
<P>The Doctor will find, on a further examination of the text, that the birth of Isaiah's son is only an <HI>allusion</HI> or <HI>imperfect imitation</HI> of the former REMOTE SIGN mentioned in the seventh chapter (viz. of Im∣manuel's birth) in the same manner as the <HI>brazen serpent</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

<P><PB N="34" REF="35"/><HI>"But when the</HI> FULNESS OF TIME <HI>was come,"</HI> the angel Gabriel was sent from God to Nazareth with a FURTHER REVELATION of the then approaching SIGN of the redemption promised by Isaiah.</P>
<P>The <HI>blessed virgin</HI> answered (Luke i. 34.) <Q>How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man?</Q></P>
<P>That <HI>"a woman should compass a man"</HI> (viz. conceive and bear a son without the knowledge of man), this was an event scarcely to be expected or comprehended by man; it being the <HI>new thing</HI> which God had created in the earth, spoken of by the prophet Jeremiah xxxi. 22. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"How long wilt thou go about, O thou back-sliding daughter?

Gen. iii. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>The occasion of Isaiah's prophecy, concerning the miraculous birth of Immanuel, is mentioned in the beginning of the seventh chapter— <Q>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil council against thee, (Ahaz) saying, Let us go up against Judah, and vex it; and let us make a breach therein for us, and <HI>set</HI> A KING
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
IN THE MIDST OF IT, even the son of Tabeal.</Q> But <Q><HI>thus saith the Lord God,</HI> It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</Q></P>
<P>Now, this was a confirmation of the promise made by God to David, and delivered by Nathan the prophet (2 Sam. vii. 16.) viz. <Q><HI>Thine house</HI> and <HI>thy kingdom</HI> shall be established for ever be∣fore thee: THY THRONE shall be established for EVER.</Q></P>
<P>Therefore, as Justin Martyr observes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Justini Dialogus cum Try∣phone Judaeo, pag. 293, Paris Edition, 1636.</NOTE>, if the prophecy, <HI>"Behold a virgin shall conceive,"</HI> had not been spoken to the house of David, but to any other house of the twelve tribes, the affair might have been doubtful: but the sign was really given to the HOUSE OF DAVID (see 13th verse— <Q>Hear ye now, O house of David</Q>); and as no man was <HI>ever born of a virgin,</HI> except the MESSIAH, who, on account of this birth, was called the SON OF DA∣VID; therefore it was surely the properest sign that could be given, to assure them that the <HI>house</HI> and the KINGDOM of DAVID <HI>should be established for ever,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
and that the evil council of Syria and Ephraim should not stand. The house and the kingdom of David cannot be established FOR EVER, in the per∣son of any of David's descendants, except the Mes∣siah himself; for (with respect to the present times) the worldly kingdom of David ceased very many ages ago, and his people the children of Israel be∣ing most deservedly ejected (on account of their wickedness and unbelief) from their old inheritance the land of Canaan, have never since obtained any other as a possession; but for near seventeen hun∣dred years have been dispersed throughout the whole world: and yet, by the manifest providence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bishop Newton's Dissertation on the Prophecies, 1st vol. p. 215 to 238, where that learned author treats very fully and pathetically concerning the remarkable pro∣vidence of God in the preservation of the Jews.</NOTE> of God, they remain to this day, in the <HI>midst of all nations, a distinct</HI> and <HI>peculiar people;</HI> so that their present state is an authentic and undeniable voucher of the truth of the Holy Scriptures <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>What is occasionally said by Moses and other pro∣phets, concerning the future state of God's people, the Jews, is alone sufficient to establish the divine authority of the holy writings.

<P>But Christ's <HI>spiritual kingdom of Israel,</HI> into which we are adopted, is everlasting; and the prophet Isaiah gave Ahaz, and his cotemporaries of <HI>the house of David,</HI> the strongest assurances that it should be so.— <Q>Of the increase of his govern∣ment and peace</Q> (says he in the ninth chapter, which I have already shewn to have been delivered nearly at the same time with the seventh chapter) <Q>there shall be <HI>NO END,</HI> upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice <HI>from henceforth even for ever: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In page 37, Dr. W—ms says, <Q>The last ob∣jection which I know that can be made to my sense of the passage is, that it is utterly incon∣sistent with the words of St. Matthew, chap. i. 22, 23.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39"/>Here I must intirely agree with the Doctor, though I am not the better satisfied with his hypo∣thesis.</P>
<P>Now, that we may thoroughly understand the text in question, it will be necessary to consider St. Matthew's application of it.</P>
<P>He informs us, that <Q>the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came toge∣ther, she was found with <HI>child of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.

proof) of a passage to a particular sense to which it <HI>originally had no reference.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But should we not seem to pay very little regard to Gospel testimony (I now speak as to Christians) if we were to suppose, that the prophecy <HI>originally had no reference</HI> to this event, when an apostle <HI>ex∣presly affirms</HI> that it had?</P>
<P>Might not Dr. Doddridge's observation (quoted in page 38 of the Crit. Dissert.) be then, with more justice, urged against us? viz. <Q>This way of pro∣ceeding will make the Scriptures the most un∣certain writings in the world.</Q> But now let us see how this notion of <HI>an accommodation</HI> will suit with the rest of the Doctor's hypothesis.</P>
<P>He says (page 44.) <Q>I think that the prophet had <HI>no reference to the Messiah,</HI> and that the evan∣gelist only alludes to this passage in Isaiah, be∣cause it was <HI>remarkably suitable</HI> to the matter which he was relating.</Q> Now the Doctor seems to have forgot his former opinion in page 23; viz. <Q>that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> doth not appear to <HI>signify strictly a virgin.</HI></Q></P>
<P>For if this were true, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> doth not sig∣nify a virgin, in what sense could the text be esteemed <HI>remarkably suitable</HI> to the miraculous con∣ception of a VIRGIN by the HOLY GHOST? and in what manner could the <HI>accommodation of it</HI> to that <HI>singular event</HI> assist the sacred historian <Q>BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION?</Q> (See page 40.)</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41"/>Nay, the Doctor has even taken great pains to render the text REMARKABLY UNSUITABLE! for he would have us understand that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the YOUNG WOMAN (as he construes it) spoken of in the text, was so <HI>far from being a</HI> VIRGIN, that she was with child ("IS CONCEIVING and BEARING a SON," says he in page 37.) even at the time when she was pointed at (as he supposes in page 31.) by the pro∣phet. These words (viz. <Q>IS CONCEIVING and BEARING a SON)</Q> are a part of what he has given us in page 37, as a <Q><HI>literal translation</HI> of the ori∣ginal;</Q> but it is so far from being so, that the true sense of <HI>the letter,</HI> or text, seems to be ex∣changed for that of the interlineary version of the London Polyglot, which renders it <Q>praegnans &amp; pariens.</Q></P>
<P>But the words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> are not participles active, but are in the perfect tense; yet there needs no apology for the Septuagint and other translations in rendering them as if they were of the <HI>future</HI> tense, because the sentence, to which they belong, is plainly the prediction of a <HI>future</HI> event <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">— <Q>It is a well-known observation of the Christian and Jewish doctors, that the prophet seeing in his mind's eye the events he foretels, often speaks of them as al∣ready past.</Q> Dr. Sharpe's 2d Argument in Defence of Christianity, p. 309—in a note.</NOTE>; for in prophetical writings the perfect is frequently used
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
for the <HI>future</HI> tense. <Q>Apud prophetas autem cre∣berrime (praeteritum) pro futuro usurpatur, quo res certò futûra significetur, perinde ac si jam evenisset: ut puer <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> natus est nobis, pro nas∣cetur.</Q> BYTHNER. Institutio Linguae sanctae, p. 10. Dr. W—ms's <HI>literal translation</HI> (as he calls it) of the <HI>perfect</HI> tense into the <HI>participle</HI> active can∣not (I believe) be so easily vindicated.</P>
<P>Would it not be very unnatural to suppose, that the prophets have been intirely silent concerning this most remarkable sign of the Messiah (viz. his being BORN OF A VIRGIN) insomuch that an evan∣gelist should be obliged to ACCOMMODATE to this <HI>singular circumstance</HI> a passage, which originally had <HI>"no reference to</HI> THE MESSIAH?" And that he should attempt to pass such a MERE ACCOMMODA∣TION upon the world for the genuine sense of the prophet, by signifying in the strongest terms, that this text was <HI>fulfilled</HI> by the circumstances which he there relates?</P>
<P>The evangelist thus expresses himself: <Q>Now ALL THIS WAS DONE, that it <HI>might be fulfilled</HI> which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,</Q> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. which implies, that, if ALL THIS had not come to pass, the <HI>word of the Lord by the prophet</HI> would not have <HI>been fulfilled;</HI> therefore this case is by no
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
means similar to the instances of ACCOMMODATION drawn from the GRECIAN POETS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The learned author whom Dr. W—ms has quoted in page 41, has made a very necessary reserve on this head, which the Doctor has omitted in his quotation; viz. <Q>But indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from prophane authors and the prophets.</Q></NOTE> in page 41.</P>
<P>But why should any one attempt, now-a-days, to explain away the genuine meaning of a prophecy, <HI>so literally fulfilled</HI> by the miraculous birth of Christ, when even <HI>the Jewish interpreters,</HI> near 300 years (i. e. according to the Chronicon of Eusebius 279 years) before that wonderful event, had construed the same prophecy in such a manner, that it could not possibly be applied to any person whatsoever, except the promised Messiah, who ALONE WAS BORN OF A VIRGIN?</P>
<P>This testimony of the Septuagint was taken no∣tice of by Origen contra Celsum <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. Quod si Judaeus vocabula excutiens, neget scrip∣tum, <HI>Ecce virginem,</HI> fed <HI>Ecce adolescentula;</HI> dicêmus ibi legi vocem ALMA, quam Septuaginta interpretes verterunt virginem, &amp;c. Cambridge Edition, 1677, p. 27.</NOTE> (p. 27.) and is certainly of much greater authority in favour of the true sense of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (rendered by
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
them <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>a virgin</HI>) than any thing that Dr. W—ms has offered against it.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that all the ancient MSS. of the Septuagint, in different parts of the world, tes∣tify the truth of this reading; of which four in par∣ticular are of considerable authority on account of their very great antiquity; viz. the Vatican, Alex∣andrian, Complutensian, and Venetian MSS. And though many copies of the Septuagint must have been in the hands of Jews, as well as others, both before and after the birth of Christ, yet I never heard that any person ever produced a copy which con∣tradicted this original reading; for as the Septuagint was the common translation used in the synagogues throughout all Asia, Greece, and Egypt (see Bp. Walton's Prolegomena ix. p. 60. N<SUP>o</SUP> 15.) any alte∣ration in so remarkable a text as this would very soon have been discovered.</P>
<P>And it must also be remembered, that the seve∣ral Greek translations, wherein the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is rendered <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a <HI>young woman</HI> (viz. that of Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus) were all made <HI>after the birth of Christ,</HI> when the unbelieving Jews were desirous of perverting the true meaning of the pro∣phecy.</P>
<P>The ancient Syriac version expresses <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> by the very word (viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) which the Doctor sets up in opposition to it; and which he justly observes) must signify strictly a
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
VIRGIN <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Rabbins always by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> mean a <HI>virgin:</HI> that they well understand their own language cannot be denied, &amp;c. p. 20.—See also p. 25, where, speaking of the Sep∣tuagint translation of Esther ii. 2. he adds, <Q>whence it must undeniably appear, that they understood <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to mean <HI>A VIRGIN</HI> in the strictest sense of the word.</Q></NOTE>. And lastly, St. Matthew, whether he quoted the Original or Septuagint, was certainly convinced that the true sense of the word was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a VIRGIN, and he hath accordingly left us his testimony of it; which proves that the Doctor's application of this word to <HI>the mother of Isaiah's son</HI> must be very erroneous.</P>
<P>The child, <HI>Immanuel,</HI> could not be Isaiah's son, because it appears from so many undeniable testi∣monies, that his <HI>mother</HI> was to be really <HI>a virgin;</HI> and because <HI>the event itself</HI> (by which the prophecy is best understood) has proved this truth beyond all contradiction.</P>
<P>Wherefore, I think, I may now safely conclude in Dr. W—ms's own words, before quoted, that his opinion concerning this text <Q>IS UTTERLY IN∣CONSISTENT WITH THE WORDS OF ST. MAT∣THEW,</Q> and of course, that the Doctor is <HI>indispen∣sably bound</HI> to yield up his hypothesis to the <HI>superior authority of the evangelist.</HI></P>

<HEAD><PB REF="47"/>A DISSERTATION ON THE NATURE and STYLE OF Prophetical Writings, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE prophecies contained in the seventh, eighth, and ninth chapters of Isaiah seem to have been delivered during the general consternation of the house of David, occasioned by the invasion of Rezin king of Syria, and Pekah king of Israel; because several circumstances relating to the said kings, and their respective nations, are mentioned in each of these chapters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Septimum, octavum, et nonum Isaiae caput in eodem fere versantur argumento, &amp;c. <HI>P. D. Huetii Demonstratio Evangelica,</HI> p. 291.</NOTE>; notwithstanding that the same chapters
<PB N="4" REF="48"/>
contain prophecies of very distant events, which are so blended with the transactions of the (then) present times, that it would not be easy to dis∣tinguish the real difference in point of chronology, if the apparent accomplishment of these several prophecies did not remove the difficulty. Rezin and Pekah are both particularly mentioned in the 7th chapter, wherein the extraordinary birth of the <HI>child Immanuel</HI> is given as a sign. The spoiling of their respective cities is promised in the 8th chapter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"For before the child <HI>(Maher-shalal-hash-baz)</HI> shall have knowledge to cry, My father and my mother, the <HI>riches of Damascus,</HI> and the <HI>spoil of Samaria,</HI> shall be taken away before the king of Assyria." viii. 4. "Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in <HI>Rezin,</HI> and <HI>Remaliah</HI>'s <HI>son:</HI> Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of <HI>Assyria,</HI>" &amp;c.—"And the stretch∣ing out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, <HI>O Immanuel.</HI>" viii. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE>, wherein the birth of the child Maher∣shalalhashbaz the son of Isaiah is foretold, as the temporary sign of the same; and notwithstanding that the greatest part of the said chapter relates to those times, yet the prophet introduces in the very midst of it a plain reference to the times of the Messiah, see 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th verses, which shall be hereafter considered. In the 9th chapter, the <HI>presumption of Ephraim</HI> and the in∣habitants
<PB N="5" REF="49"/>
of Samaria <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"And all the people shall know, even <HI>Ephraim</HI> and the inhabitants of <HI>Samaria,</HI> that say in the pride and stout∣ness of heart, The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewen stones," &amp;c. ix. 9, 10. "Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of <HI>Rezin</HI> against him," &amp;c. ix. 11. These three verses, 9th, 10th, and 11th, and also the 21st, plainly allude to the subject of the 7th chapter; viz. the evil council and confederacy of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and God's promise that the same should not stand.</NOTE> is reproved, and God's judgments are once more expresly denounced <HI>against Rezin;</HI> as if these things were to happen after the birth of the <HI>child</HI> that was to <Q>be called <HI>Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the ever∣lasting Father, the Prince of peace,</HI> of the in∣crease of <HI>whose government and peace</HI> there should be <HI>no end,</HI> upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom,</Q> &amp;c. for the birth of this divine person is foretold in the former part of the same chapter; and yet I never heard of an attempt to apply this prophecy to a son of Isaiah, or to any other child born about that time.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this 9th chapter the prophet alludes likewise to some other historical circum∣stances, besides what are already mentioned con∣cerning Syria and Ephraim; and these had either then lately happened, or were very shortly to come to pass, notwithstanding that the allusion is
<PB N="6" REF="50"/>
blended with a very distant prophecy concerning the preaching of Christ.</P>
<P>The circumstances, which I speak of, are the Assyrian conquest and captivity of <HI>Zebulun</HI> and <HI>Napthali,</HI> which happened in the days of Pekah king of Israel <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">"In the days of Pekah king of Israel, came Tiglath∣pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maa∣chah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and <HI>Galilee,</HI> all the land of Napthali, and carried them captive to Assyria." 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xv. 29.</NOTE>. This was the affliction <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of <HI>Zebulun,</HI> and the land of <HI>Napthali,</HI> and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jor∣dan in <HI>Galilee</HI> of the nations. <HI>Isaiah</HI> ix. 1. The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light," &amp;c. ix. 2.</NOTE> <HI>by the</HI> <Q>way of the sea, beyond Jordan in Galilee <HI>of the nations,</HI></Q> mentioned by Isaiah ix. 1. by which he expresly points out the very spot, <HI>Galilee,</HI> where <HI>Immanuel</HI> was chiefly to be manifested by his mighty deeds and miracles: for the prophet immediately proceeds, verse 2. <Q>The people (says he) <HI>that walked in darkness</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This corresponds with the prejudice which the Jews conceived against their brethren the Galilaeans. The chief Priests and Pharisees answered Nicodemus, saying, "Search and look: for out of <HI>Galilee</HI> ariseth <HI>no Prophet." John</HI> vii. 52. In like manner answered Nathaniel, when Philip told him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law and the Prophets did write, <HI>Jesus</HI> of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." And Nathanael said unto him, <HI>Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?</HI> John i. 45, 46.</NOTE> <HI>have seen a great light:</HI> they
<PB N="7" REF="51"/>
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon <HI>them hath the light shined.</HI></Q> And after∣wards in the 6th verse he renews the same promises given in the 7th chapter, concerning the <HI>birth of a divine child;</HI> whose attributes and dignity are here so fully expressed by the prophet, that they can by no means agree with the character <HI>of any other child,</HI> but that which was truly <HI>Immanuel,</HI> or <HI>God with us.</HI> Therefore it is plain that the pro∣phecies of the 8th and 9th chapters were delivered nearly at the same time with those of the 7th chapter, which are further explained and confirmed thereby; so that if Dr. W—ms will carefully ex∣amine all these three chapters, he will find, that it is <HI>not unusual</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>See Dr. W—ms's comment on the opinion of those who say, that the 14th, 15th, and 16th verses of the viith chap. of <HI>Isaiah</HI> contain two distinct prophecies.

<P>But an experienced writer, who, on many occasions, has given ample proofs of great learning and scripture-know∣ledge, informs us, that <Q><HI>It is</HI> very natural <HI>and</HI> very usual <HI>with the Prophets to make</HI> a transition from one great de∣liverance to another, as also from one great destruction to another</Q> —and he afterwards gives several remarkable in∣stances of it.

<PB N="8" REF="52"/>
another, <HI>nor unnatural</HI> that a very distant prophecy should be blended with others that were soon to be accomplished; because it <HI>is the nature of prophecy</HI> to be delivered in this mysterious manner. For (says Isaiah xxviii. 10) <Q>precept must be (or hath been) upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, <HI>here a little</HI> and <HI>there a little.</HI> For with stammering lips, and another tongue, will he speak (or he hath spoken) to this people.</Q> And again in the 13th verse, <Q><HI>here a little and there a little;</HI> that they might go and fall back∣ward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</Q> The nature and reason of typical writings are strongly expressed in St. Mark's Gospel <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">"And when he (Jesus) was alone, they that were about him with the twelve, asked of him the parable. And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but <HI>unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</HI> that seeing they may see, and <HI>not perceive,</HI> and hearing they may hear, <HI>and not understand;</HI> lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. And he said unto them, know ye not this parable? and how then will you know all parables? The sower soweth, &amp;c."

<PB N="9" REF="53"/>
when we read the scriptures, that we may under∣stand them to our comfort; lest they should be a stumbling block to us, as they were to the un∣believing Jews. But not only the scriptures, even Christ himself became a stone of stumbling to the Jews. For, about the time of his coming, they universally expected a glorious and triumphant Messiah to rule over them; insomuch that Herod the Great was exceedingly alarmed with the appre∣hension of so powerful a competitor <HI>for the throne of David.</HI> But when <HI>"the desire of all nations"</HI> (see Haggai ii. 7.) was really come, his humble ap∣pearance, meekness, and disinterested, <HI>though in∣teresting,</HI> doctrine, did not in the least correspond with their worldly imaginations; so that <Q>he was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</Q> John i. 10, 11. For the Jews did not then consider (any more than they do at present) that the humility of the Messiah was as expresly foretold by the prophets as his glory. <HI>"Who hath believed our report?"</HI> says Isaiah in chap. liii. when he is about to describe the humility, afflictions, and death of the Messiah. <Q>He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we
<PB N="10" REF="54"/>
shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. <HI>He is despised and rejected of men,</HI></Q> &amp;c. See the whole chapter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Who can read this oracle, and not allow Isaiah to have been, what he is sometimes called, the Evangelical Prophet? Is not this prophecy in every part as applicable to Jesus, as is the account given of him by the holy Evangelists?

And yet it was delivered above 700 years before the birth of Jesus.</Q> <HI>Dr.</HI> Gregory Sharpe's 2d Argument in Defence of Christianity, pag. <HI>232.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Jews could not reconcile this unexpected <HI>humility</HI> with that glorious character which they so long looked for and desired, viz. <Q>a king that should reign and prosper;</Q> whom <HI>"the Lord"</HI> (Je∣hovah) promised by Jeremiah <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Behold the days come, saith the Lord (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Jeho∣vah</HI>) that I will raise unto David a righteous branch, and <HI>a king shall reign and prosper,</HI> and shall execute judg∣ment and justice in the earth. In his days <HI>Judah</HI> shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, <HI>The Lord (Jehovah</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>our righteousness.</HI></Q> —Jeremiah xxiii. 5, 6. See also xxxiii. 16.—where the same title (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) is given to the Branch of righteousness mentioned in the preceding verse.—Compare with these chap. xxx. 9.— <Q>And they shall serve the <HI>Lord their God</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) and <HI>David their king</HI></Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <Q>whom I will raise up unto them.</Q> —The comparing of these texts together has occasioned the following remark, which I find wrote with a pencil in the margin of my Hebrew Bible, I suppose by some former owner of it. <Q>Messias vocabitur David secun∣dum carnem, <HI>Jova</HI> secundum divinitatem</Q> —i.e. <Q>Christ shall be called <HI>David</HI> with respect to his human nature, and <HI>Jehovah</HI> with respect to his divinity.</Q> —The divinity of the Messiah may be clearly proved by a multitude of other pas∣sages even in the Old Testament. Therefore it behoves <HI>the authors of the Critical Review</HI> seriously to consider how those men can be justified, who refuse the Son of God the honour due unto his name; since <Q>the Father hath com∣mitted all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.</Q> John v. 22, 23.</P>
<P>A doctrine very opposite to this is approved and com∣mended in the 10th article of the <HI>Critical Review for May</HI> 1760; whereby it appears, that the author or authors of that recommendatory criticism were not sufficiently armed against the dangerous and pernicious doctrines of the book which they undertook to recommend, viz. <HI>The Trinitarian Controversy reviewed; or a Defence of the Appeal to the common Sense of all Christian People.</HI></P></NOTE> to <Q>raise up unto
<PB N="11" REF="55"/>
<HI>David,</HI></Q> and who is likewise called (as a name the most suitable to the only begotten Son of God) <HI>"the Lord,"</HI> (Jehovah) <HI>"our righteousness."</HI> This unfortunate misapprehension was plainly foretold by Isaiah, when he warned the people to <HI>"sanctify the "Lord of hosts himself</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) and (says he) <Q>let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</Q> Now, what person could the prophet mean by this glorious title (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Jehovah Sabaoth</HI>) if not the Messiah? for he im∣mediately adds, <Q>and he shall be for a sanctuary,

<HI>but</HI> (or rather <HI>and</HI>) for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a <HI>gin,</HI> and for a <HI>snare</HI> to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<P>We have the testimony of St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans (ix. 33.) <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">— <Q>for they <HI>stumbled</HI> at that <HI>stumbling stone;</HI> as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a <HI>stumbling stone,</HI> and <HI>rock of offence:</HI> and whosoever believeth on <HI>him, shall not be ashamed.</HI></Q> Rom. ix. 32, 33.</NOTE> that this text <HI>re∣lates to Christ;</HI> for he has there blended a part of it with another quotation from Isaiah xxviii. 16. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a <HI>stone,</HI> a <HI>tried stone,</HI> a precious <HI>corner stone,</HI> a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not <HI>make haste,</HI></Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) that is, he shall not be sub∣ject to that kind <HI>of haste,</HI> which is commonly the effect <HI>of fear.</HI> Therefore the Syriac version has rendered it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>shall not be afraid;</HI> which is very expressive of the Prophet's meaning. The LXX have rendered it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and St. Paul, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, <HI>shall not be ashamed;</HI> which is still more expressive of a man's being free from that <HI>haste</HI> or confusion caused by fear. <HI>Not to be ashamed</HI> is frequently put for <HI>not to fear.</HI> They shall <HI>not be ashamed</HI> in the <HI>evil time,</HI> says the Psalmist, xxxvii. 19. and again—they shall <HI>not be ashamed,</HI> but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

<P>This I hope is sufficient to reconcile the seeming disagree∣ment between the original and St. Paul's quotation.</P></NOTE>

St. Peter likewise quotes it in his 1st Epistle ii. 8.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>And a <HI>stone of stumbling and a rock of offence</HI> even to them which <HI>stumble</HI> at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also they were appointed.</Q></NOTE> and applies it to Christ. And indeed it can mean no other than <HI>"Christ crucified,"</HI> who (as St. Paul informs us) was <Q>to the Jews <HI>a stumbling block,</HI> and unto the Greeks foolishness,</Q> 1 Cor. i. 23. But notwith∣standing these plain testimonies, Dr. W—ms is of a very different opinion. <Q>Isaiah does not seem, <HI>(says the Dr. in a note, p. 32)</HI> to speak of the Messiah till the ixth chapter.</Q> But though the Dr. here allows that the ixth chapter contains a prophecy concerning the Messiah; yet perhaps he is not aware, that if his reasons against the com∣mon interpretation of the viith chapter (on account of <HI>"the present order, and abrupt transition"</HI> which he complains of in p. 10.) <HI>were at all conclusive,</HI> the same would hold good likewise against the com∣mon interpretation of this ixth chapter; wherein the <HI>transitions</HI> from one subject to another are equally <HI>abrupt,</HI> and the remote events concerning the <HI>birth</HI> and <HI>preaching</HI> of the Messiah are foretold, even before other events <Q>which were immediately, or very shortly to happen.</Q> (See p. 9.)</P>
<P>The Dr. may be right enough in his observation that there are no instances <Q>of <HI>remote signs</HI> to prove the accomplishment of an event near at hand.</Q> (See pages 9 and 10.) But it is plainly his own mistake which causes the difficulty that he

speaks of; for the sign given by Isaiah of the birth of <HI>Immanuel,</HI> (viz. behold a virgin shall conceive, &amp;c.) was not a remote sign of <HI>an event near at hand</HI> (as the Dr. supposes) but a <HI>remote sign</HI> of <HI>a remote event,</HI> and therefore not liable to his censure.</P>
<P>The holy scriptures afford a great many other examples of prophecies, which are blended and interwoven with very different subjects; different, I say, both with respect to the matter, and the time of accomplishment.</P>
<P>There are also many instances of passages which bear a double construction, being partly applicable to some particular person expresly mentioned, though they ultimately and chiefly relate to another very different person.</P>
<P>The prophecy of Nathan concerning Solomon is of this kind. <Q>He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son.</Q> 2 Sam. vii. 13, 14. King David himself ex∣plained this more particularly to his son Solomon, and applied it to him, 1 Chron. xxii. 9. saying, "for his name shall be <HI>Solomon</HI> (see the margin <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>"peaceable"</HI> agreeable to Christ's title men∣tioned in the ixth chap. of Isaiah, viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> prince of <HI>peace</HI>) <Q>and I will give <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>quietness</HI> unto Israel in his days. He shall build an house for my name, and he shall be <HI>my son,</HI> and I will be <HI>his father,</HI> and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel <HI>for ever.</HI></Q> But where has
<PB N="15" REF="59"/>
the throne of Solomon been established for near 1800 years last past, if not in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the spiritual <HI>Solomon,</HI> and <HI>prince of peace?</HI> For though this prophecy plainly related to Solomon, yet it referred to a further acomplishment in the Messiah; by whom alone it could be perfectly fulfilled; and therefore a part of it is applied immediately to Christ by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews i. 5. <Q>I will be to him a <HI>father,</HI> and he shall be to me a <HI>son.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Of the same kind is the lxxiid psalm, dedicated to <HI>Solomon.</HI> <Q><HI>They shall fear</HI> thee <HI>as long as</HI> the sun and moon endure throughout all generations.</Q> This is indeed applied to <HI>Solomon;</HI> but as the reign of that monarch was merely <HI>temporal,</HI> the prophecy cannot be said to be fulfilled in any other person besides the Messiah himself, the true <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (Solomon) who <HI>reigns,</HI> according to the Psalmist's expression <HI>"throughout all generations."</HI></P>
<P>The prophet Haggai, chap. ii. promises <HI>Zerub∣babel governor of Judah,</HI> and <HI>Joshua the high priest,</HI> in the name of <HI>the Lord of hosts,</HI> that <Q>the desire of all nations shall come,</Q> and that he (the Lord of hosts) <Q><HI>will fill this house</HI> (that is, the house which they were ordered to build) with glory.</Q> v. 7. And he adds in the 9th verse, <Q>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give <HI>peace</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) saith the Lord of hosts.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="60"/>Nevertheless, in the former part of the same chapter, the prophet appeals to those who had seen the <Q>house in her first glory: and how (says he) do you see it now? Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?</Q> v. 3. Thus it is plain that the glory of the second house did not consist either in the grandeur of the building laid out by Zerubbabel and Joshua, or in the presence of those great and holy men; notwithstanding that the prophecy is addressed to them both, and that Zerubbabel is spoken to by God in a very re∣markable manner at the conclusion of the same chapter, viz. <Q>I will take thee, <HI>O Zerubbabel my servant,</HI> the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make <HI>thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee,</HI> saith the Lord of hosts.</Q> But the glory was, manifestly, to consist in the "<HI>future coming,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of the desire of all nations.</HI>" For as the promise was made to Zerubbabel and Joshua themselves, the prophecy must necessarily be understood to have a more distant accomplishment; which indeed the beginning of the sentence sufficiently proves, viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Yet once, it is a little while,</HI> and <HI>I will shake the heavens,</HI> &amp;c. Haggai ii. 6, 7.</P>
<P>The prophet Zachariah likewise promises great things to Zerubbabel and Joshua; which he ap∣plies personally to them as builders of the temple;
<PB N="17" REF="61"/>
though the same relate ultimately to Christ. See chap. iv. 6—10.</P>
<P>See also chap. vi. 11, 12, 13. wherein Joshua by his name (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which the LXX render <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Jesus,</HI> signifying a Saviour) as well as by his office and dignity of high priest, was plainly set forth as a type of the future Messiah.</P>
<P>The prophet orders him to be crowned, and saluted with the prophetical title of Christ, viz. <HI>the branch,</HI> of whom he foretold, that he should <Q>grow up out of his place,</Q> and <Q>build the temple of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>Joshua might, indeed, be said to build the temple, as well as Zerubbabel, but he could only be a type of the branch there promised, because the real branch was yet to grow up out of his place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"And speak unto him <HI>(Joshua)</HI> saying, Thus speak∣eth the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is the <HI>branch,</HI> and <HI>he shall grow up out of his place,</HI> and he shall build the temple of the Lord, &amp;c." Zech. vi. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The crowns were given <Q>for a memorial in the temple of the Lord,</Q> (not of the accomplishment of this prophecy in the person of Joshua, but <Q>for a memorial</Q>) of what <HI>should afterwards</HI> <Q>come to pass</Q> <HI>if the people would diligently obey the voice of the Lord their God</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"And the crowns shall be to Helem and to Tobijah, &amp;c.—<HI>for a memorial</HI> in the temple of the Lord.

Thus we find that <HI>Solomon,
<PB N="18" REF="62"/>
Zerubbabel,</HI> and <HI>Joshua,</HI> as builders of the temple, were types of the Messiah, the <HI>true builder</HI> of the <HI>everlasting</HI> TEMPLE OF GOD; I mean, the HOLY CATHOLICK CHURCH, <HI>properly</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>The church of Rome is very <HI>improperly</HI> called the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> because she causes a contradiction in terms, by usurping that <HI>general</HI> title to herself alone; when at the same time she scarcely seems intitled to be esteemed a part of it. For notwithstanding that many worthy mem∣bers of Christ's Catholick Church may have submitted to her communion for want of better information, serving God by the sincerity of their intentions; yet, <Q>what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?</Q> (2 Corinth. vi. 10.) Wherefore <HI>"come out of her"</HI> (ye people of God) <Q><HI>that ye be not partakers</HI> of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</Q> Rev. xviii. 4.

These are no part of <HI>the foundation</HI> (mentioned above) of the <HI>Apostles and Prophets,</HI> whose writings warrant no such <HI>idolatry, exorcisms,</HI> or <HI>enchantments:</HI> and therefore even the <HI>Holy Scriptures themselves</HI> are prohibited in the Popish <HI>Index Expurgatorius.</HI> This last is indeed a precaution necessary to the existence of such doctrines; for if the poor deluded people were permitted to read the Scriptures, they would soon be informed that there is but <Q><HI>One Mediator</HI> between God and man, the <HI>Man Christ Jesus;</HI></Q> (1 Tim. ii. 5.) and that <Q><HI>there is</HI> none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.</Q> Acts iv. 12. O that those men who invoke the <HI>mediation of all saints and angels</HI> (notwithstanding the plain doctrine of St. <HI>Peter</HI> quoted above) would consider what a gross affront by <HI>this execrable service</HI> they offer to Christ, who alone is the <HI>way,</HI> and the <HI>truth,</HI> and the <HI>life!</HI> for their daily prayers witness against them that they do not esteem the <HI>mediation of Christ</HI> sufficient for them, otherwise they would not, like the ido∣latrous Israelites of old, invoke <HI>"all the host of heaven."</HI> 2 Kings xvii. 16. The <HI>Church of Rome</HI> has endeavoured to cloak this abominable worship with the subtle distinctions of <HI>Latria</HI> and <HI>Dulia;</HI> but the necessity of such sophistical arguments proves the reality of that church's backsliding to idolatry. <HI>Heathen Rome</HI> was not more guilty of this crime, nor hath shed more innocent <HI>blood</HI> in defence of <HI>such abo∣minations</HI> under the old Pagan Emperors, than the present Church of Rome has done, since her <HI>Bishops</HI> have assumed <HI>their seat;</HI> that is, have possessed themselves of <HI>the temporal,</HI> as well as ecclesiastical jurisdiction of that ancient city.— So that the Church of Rome, may, indeed, be said to have mounted the <HI>scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy,</HI> (Rev. xvii. 3.) and is, accordingly, most truly described by St. John as a <HI>woman drunken with the blood of the saints,</HI> and <HI>with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Archbishop Cranmer, the Bishops Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, and a great multitude of other worthy <HI>Englishmen</HI> have suffered under her diabolical tyranny.</P>
<P>Indeed the histories of all other European kingdoms are fraught with woful examples of it. In Sully's Memoirs (chap. v. p. 9.) we read that a Popish prayer-book (<Q>livra de grosses heures</Q>) served as a <HI>passport</HI> among the bloody messengers of Popish vengeance at the <HI>massacre</HI> of the Huguenots at Paris. <Q>Tuë, Tuë, ô Huguenot, ô Hu∣guenot,</Q> was the devilish watch-word!</P>

<P><PB N="21" REF="65"/>Compare the above mentioned texts with 1 Cor. iii. 11. John ii. 18—22. Luke xx. 17.18. Acts iv. 11. Psalm cxviii. 22. Isaiah xxviii. 16.</P>
<P>It would make a large volume if I were to col∣lect all the prophecies which absolutely relate to two different and distinct subjects in the type and antitype. Nevertheless, I am particularly obliged to take notice of two more of this kind, because Dr. W—ms has quoted them in favour of his hy∣pothesis, notwithstanding that upon examination they will be found to make much against it. He says (in p. 38.) <Q>it is <HI>not possible indeed</HI> to <HI>reconcile Matthew</HI> ii. 15.23. and perhaps some other passages in his gospel, with <HI>any particular pro∣phecy now extant</HI> in the Old Testament.</Q> As to the 15th verse, wherein St. Matthew quotes the Prophet Hosea xi. 1. <Q>(out of Egypt have I called my son)</Q> the Dr. observes that <Q>the passage in Hosea where these words are found, <HI>is not a pro∣phecy of a future event,</HI> but a declaration of an event long past, and therefore <HI>could not be ful∣filled</HI> when the child JESUS came out of Egypt.</Q></P>
<P>Now, in one respect, the Dr. is right, viz. that the passage, with regard to the people of Israel, <Q>is a declaration of an event long past:</Q> nevertheless he has not assigned any reason why the same passage may not, <HI>likewise,</HI> contain a prophecy <HI>of a future event,</HI> by being intended, like many other prophe∣cies, to bear a double application.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="66"/>Erasmus has assigned a reason for the error of Julian the apostate concerning this text; viz. <Q>that he has too much followed the septuagint edi∣tion; <HI>nimirum secutus editionem septuaginta</HI></Q> (says he) <Q>qui locum hunc transtulerunt in hunc mo∣dum, quia <HI>parvulus</HI> Israel, et ego dilexi <HI>eum,</HI> et ex Aegypta vocavi <HI>filics ejus.</HI></Q> (Annot. in Mat∣thaeum, p. 250.)</P>
<P>A misunderstanding of this text is very ex∣cuseable, likewise, in the authors of that Greek version, who could not easily comprehend <HI>before the event,</HI> that the Messiah should be called out of Egypt, as the children of Israel had been before him; and therefore they rendered the passage in such a manner as they thought would best point out the application of it to the people of Israel <HI>only;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <Q>and out of Egypt have I called <HI>his children.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But if the <HI>prophet himself</HI> had intended the same thing, <HI>and that only,</HI> he would, most likely, have made use of terms more expressive of <HI>a nation,</HI> or <HI>people,</HI> than of <HI>a single person;</HI> <Q>(from Egypt have I called my son,</Q> —) and then the Greek inter∣preters would not have been obliged to leave the literal sense of the original in order to adopt it with propriety to <HI>the people of Israel;</HI> which proves, that some <HI>single person</HI> is more particularly pointed at by the prophet, than <HI>the people</HI> of Israel.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, many passages of Scripture, wherein nations are represented by single persons;
<PB N="23" REF="67"/>
Ezekiel warned the <HI>two houses</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> under the figure of two adulterous women, Aholah and Aho∣libah, &amp;c. But the text in question is very different from many others of that kind; for the <HI>people</HI> of Israel are not only represented therein under the figure of a <HI>single person,</HI> but some eminent single person is likewise plainly represented, at the same time, under the <HI>name</HI> and <HI>figure</HI> of the <HI>people of Israel,</HI> of which the particularity of the stile affords evident testimony <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <Q>when Israel was <HI>a little child,</HI> and I loved <HI>him,</HI> and out of Egypt have I <HI>called my Son.</HI></Q> But the following part of the text, where∣in Israel could not be a type of the Messiah (I mean their forsaking God's commandments, and sacri∣ficing to Baal) is immediately expressed in <HI>the plural number,</HI> as being applicable to the children of Israel <HI>only,</HI> and not to Christ <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <Q>as <HI>they</HI> called <HI>them, so they</HI> went <HI>from them: they</HI> sacrificed unto Baalim, and burnt incense to graven images.</Q> Hosea xi. 2. Thus it is plain that the text is ap∣plicable, in the first place, to <HI>the children of Israel,</HI> who were brought by God out of Egypt, when <HI>they first began</HI> to be esteemed a nation, and there∣fore might, as a type of Christ, be likened to <HI>a little child,</HI> being <HI>young and weak,</HI> in comparison of <HI>their future state and power.</HI> And 2dly, It is un∣doubtedly very applicable to the <HI>single person</HI> of the
<PB N="24" REF="68"/>
Messiah, who was, <HI>also, called by God out of Egypt;</HI> when he was <HI>really a little child</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Before he could know to refuse the evil, and chuse the good;</HI> the land being then forsaken of <HI>both her kings,</HI> ac∣cording to Isaiah's prophecy, vii. 16.

<P>The <HI>child</HI> mentioned by Hosea as <HI>having been called</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The prophecy was, indeed, delivered in the <HI>perfect tense,</HI> as a thing already past; but this did not prevent the application of it to the <HI>future Messiah,</HI> because the <HI>perfect tense</HI> is, almost, as frequently used by the prophets in de∣claring <HI>futurity,</HI> even as the <HI>future</HI> itself.</NOTE> out of Egypt, is indeed expresly named <HI>Israel;</HI> but this is so far from setting aside the ap∣plication to Christ, that, on the contrary, it affords the strongest confirmation of it: for this name was necessarily given in the prophecy, that the appli∣cation might be double; viz. first to the people of Israel, and lastly to the Messiah.</P>
<P>The Messiah is expresly called <HI>Israel</HI> by Isaiah (xlix. 3.) in a prophecy which cannot, <HI>at all, be</HI> ap∣plied to the <HI>people of Israel,</HI> like the former; but must relate <HI>entirely</HI> to Christ. viz. <Q><HI>Thou art my servant, O Israel,</HI> in whom I will be glorified.</Q> (xlix. 3.)</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="69"/>Indeed the true sense and application of this pas∣sage does not appear without the context: never∣theless, I am not sorry for the necessity of a long quotation from this chapter, because it will convey a very clear and distinct idea of the birth and office of the Messiah, at the same time that it proves the point in question.</P>

Isaiah liii. 3, 4.</NOTE>, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers," &amp;c.—Thus far may perhaps be sufficient to shew the nature and design of the prophecy. Isaiah has introduced the important subject as the narrative of a dialogue
<PB N="27" REF="71"/>
between two distinct persons, who are both men∣tioned in this last (the 7th) verse; viz. "the Lord (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) the Redeemer of Israel," and <Q>his <HI>Holy One,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) whom man <HI>despiseth,</HI></Q> and who is also called <HI>Israel</HI> in the former part of this chapter. Now it is remarkable, that the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> or tribes of <HI>Jacob,</HI> are likewise distinctly mentioned in the same prophecy; so that the person, to whom the Lord said, <HI>"Thou art my servant, O Israel,"</HI> (see 3d verse) cannot mean any other person besides the Messiah himself; he alone being the true <Q>light to lighten the Gentiles, <HI>and</HI> the glory of his people <HI>ISRAEL.</HI></Q> For though the <HI>Jewish Religion</HI> was for many ages the only true religion, yet the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were not induced, universally, to acknowledge the truth of the Holy Scriptures by becoming proselytes to <HI>Judaism,</HI> but by being <HI>converts to Christ,</HI> by whom alone they have been <HI>enlightened</HI> according to the Scriptures. If all these things be considered, they will (I doubt not) afford sufficient proof, that the text quoted by St. Matthew from Hosea xi. 1. (though introduced in a context absolutely relating to the <HI>people of Israel</HI>) was, nevertheless, propheti∣cally intended to be applied likewise to some <HI>single person,</HI> and that the same was eminently fulfilled in the person of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the only begotten <HI>Son</HI> of God, whom the Father <HI>called out of Egypt</HI> by his angel. Jacob, and the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> may indeed be called the <HI>Sons of</HI> God, but it must be in
<PB N="28" REF="72"/>
a very different sense from the former; for they are only <HI>types</HI> of the true <HI>Israel</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) the <HI>Prince</HI> of God, who gave this name to Jacob, when he wrestled with him, that he might render him more conspicuously a type of himself; viz. as one that had <Q>power with God, and with men, and had pre∣vailed.</Q> Jacob was sensible of the <HI>Divine presence,</HI> and therefore called the name of the place <HI>Peniel,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) or (as it is expressed in the margin) <HI>the face of God;</HI> for (said he) <Q><HI>I have</HI> seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</Q> Gen. xxxii. 28, 29, 30.</P>
<P>I have already said so much concerning the nature of prophecy in general, and have quoted so many examples of two different subjects being referred to by one and the same prophetical expression, that (I hope) I need not any longer urge the reasonable∣ness of a double application, likewise, of the text quoted by St. Matthew from the Prophet Hosea; especially as Dr. W—ms has not assigned any one reason why it ought to be otherwise; nor any authority whatsoever for his assertion in page 39, that the passage <HI>"could not be fulfilled when the child Jesus came out of Egypt;"</HI> except, indeed, the autho∣rity of his own bare word: which, nevertheless, seems to have had sufficient weight with the Critical Reviewers, though it is opposed to the <HI>express testi∣mony</HI> even of <HI>an Evangelist.</HI></P>
<P>The other quotation of St. Matthew, which Dr. W—ms has called in question, is given in the
<PB N="29" REF="73"/>
2d chapter 23d verse. viz. <Q>He shall be called a Nazarene.</Q> This is one of the texts concerning which the Dr. affirms in page 38, that <HI>"it is not possible to reconcile"</HI> (it) <Q>with any particular prophecy now extant in the Old Testament.</Q> But he is greatly mistaken in this; for the text may certainly be reconciled, not only with one prophecy, but with many very <HI>particular prophecies</HI> <Q><HI>now</HI> extant in the Old Testament;</Q> and therefore St. Matthew ap∣peals with <HI>great propriety in this case,</HI> not to one prophet alone, but to the <HI>sense of all the prophets in general.</HI> viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that "which was <HI>spoken by the prophets.</HI>"</P>
<P>For though the prophets do not say expresly that <HI>"he shall be called a Nazarene;"</HI> yet many of them do plainly allude to this appellation.

<P>Now the Messiah is called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>the Branch</HI> by Isaiah iv. 2. Jeremiah xxiii. 5. and Zechariah iii. 8.</P>
<P>A plant or branch is the usual scripture-emblem for a child.— <Q><HI>Thy children,</HI> like <HI>olive branches,</HI> round about thy table,</Q> says the Psalmist in the cxxviiith Psalm, 3d verse: and in Psalm cxliv. 12. we read— <Q><HI>that</HI> our sons <HI>may</HI> grow up <HI>as the</HI> young plants.</Q> Therefore the prophets very fitly expressed the <HI>childhood</HI> and <HI>growth</HI> of the Messiah by the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> before-mentioned; for it properly signifies not only a <HI>Branch,</HI> but <HI>Germen,</HI> a <HI>bud,</HI> or young twig, which Isaiah further explains in the liiid chap. 2d verse, by the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a <HI>tender plant,</HI> or <HI>sucker;</HI> which is not only a fit emblem of the once <HI>infant state</HI> of the Messiah, but also of his <HI>gradual increase</HI> in strength and wisdom: for <Q>he shall <HI>grow up</HI> before him (says the prophet) as a <HI>tender plant,</HI> and as a <HI>root</HI> out of a dry ground;</Q> by which he assigns the true reason of Christ's being called the <HI>Branch.</HI> Indeed this whole chapter con∣tains so perfect a description of Christ's human state upon earth, that no miracle or demonstration what∣soever can be more capable of affording conviction;
<PB N="31" REF="75"/>
and, consequently, those who have read it, and still disbelieve, are inexcuseable. The prophet Zecha∣riah (vi. 12.) speaks of the <HI>growth</HI> of Christ, <HI>the Branch,</HI> in the same kind of terms, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>"He shall</HI> grow up <HI>out of his place;"</HI> or, as it is properly rendered in the margin, — <Q>he shall <HI>branch up</HI> from under him.</Q> Moreover, this prophet foretold in the same verse, that he should be named the <HI>Branch.</HI>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> "Behold the man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zechariah commanded that this prophecy should be spoken to Joshua (or Jesus) the high-priest, in the time of Zerubbabel; but I have already shewn, that he was therein only a type of our Lord Jesus the true <HI>branch.</HI></NOTE>, whose <HI>name</HI> is the <HI>Branch;</HI>" plainly alluding by the sense (though not the sound) of this appellation to Christ's being surnamed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">— secessit (Joseph) in partes Galilaeae,—ibique habitavit in urbe <HI>Nazareth,</HI> unde et Christus <HI>Nazareni cognomentum</HI> accepit, (Matt. ii. 22, 23.) et <HI>Nazarenorum</HI> Christiani.

<P>But Isaiah, in the xith chap. 1st verse, not only alludes to the sense and meaning of this surname, but to the very sound of it; for he intitles him <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Netser,</HI> a <HI>Branch.</HI> Now Christ was really called in the common Syriac dialect— <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Netseria,</HI> a <HI>Netserian</HI> or <HI>Nazarene,</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Netsereth</HI> (called

from the Greek <HI>Nazareth</HI>) where he had been brought up (Luke iv. 16.) and where (according to the true meaning of the appellation <HI>Netserian</HI> or <HI>Nazarene,</HI> when interpreted) he <HI>grew up</HI> as <HI>a plant</HI> or <HI>branch;</HI> for St. Luke informs us (ii. 40.) that <Q><HI>they</HI> (viz. Joseph and Mary, with the <HI>young child) returned</HI> into Galilee, to their own city <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and the <HI>child grew,</HI> and <HI>waxed strong</HI> in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.</Q></P>
<P>And again in the 52d verse.— <Q><HI>Jesus increased</HI> in wisdom and <HI>stature,</HI> and in favour with God and man.</Q> This exactly corresponds with Jere∣miah's prophecy (xxxiii. 15.) viz. <Q>In those days, and at that time (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) will I cause the <HI>Branch</HI> of righteousness to <HI>grow up</HI> unto David.</Q></P>
<P>If all this be considered, I think, the fitness of St. Matthew's appeal to the prophets, concerning the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, cannot be called in question, unless, like the <HI>Critical Reviewers</HI> (fol. 357.) we should believe from Dr. W—ms's <HI>bare word,</HI> that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies a <HI>Nazorite,</HI> which interpretation would, indeed, render it impossible <Q><HI>to reconcile Matthew</HI> ii. 23. <HI>with any particular prophecy</HI> now extant in the Old Testament,</Q> according to the Doctor's assertion in page 38.</P>
<P>For the Dr. informs us in the following page (39) that <HI>"the word is not</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>a Nazarene, but</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>a Nazorite:"</HI> nevertheless it is certain,
<PB N="33" REF="77"/>
that both these words signify the <HI>same thing,</HI> viz. <HI>a Nazarene</HI> (or inhabitant of <HI>Nazareth</HI>); and like∣wise, that neither of them can signify a <HI>Nazarite,</HI> or (as he spells it) <HI>Nazorite.</HI></P>
<P>For the Hebrew word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>separatus,</HI> from whence these last (<HI>Nazarite</HI> or <HI>Nazorite</HI>) are derived, is no where in Scripture rendered <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but is distinguished from them by an <HI>iota</HI> in the second syllable, viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>a Nazarite,</HI> Judges xiii. 5. and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Nazarites,</HI> Lamentations iv. 7. Besides, it is very plain throughout the whole New Testament, that Christ was not called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as being a <HI>Nazarite</HI> (for he could not properly be called so according to the law of Moses, though John the Baptist was really such) but on account of his having been brought up at the city of Nazareth, which in the Syriac tongue was called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (not with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as <HI>Nezereth,</HI> but with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>Netsereth:</HI> for the word is plainly derived from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>a branch,</HI> the name which the prophet Isaiah has given to the Messiah himself, (as is before observed) and there∣fore St. Matthew's appeal to the prophets in this case is very easily <HI>reconciled</HI> with the prophecies <HI>"now extant in the Old Testament,"</HI> though the Dr. has declared that the same <HI>"is not possible."</HI></P>
<P>Even Christ himself condescended sometimes to prophesy in the same kind of style that had before been used by his servants the prophets. <Q>Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here,
<PB N="34" REF="78"/>
which shall <HI>not taste of death,</HI> till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</Q> Matth. xvi. 28. And again, <Q>If I will that he (John) <HI>tarry till I come,</HI> what is that to thee?</Q> John xxi. 22. Here our Lord makes use of <Q>the same words and phrases</Q> with which he was wont to express his <HI>second coming to judge</HI> the world; so that his disciples understood, that John should not die; whereas the event plainly shewed, that he <Q>meant of his <HI>coming</HI></Q> (so often mentioned in the New Testament) <Q>in judgment upon the Jews at the final overthrow of Jerusalem, which St. John outlived many years.</Q> See Dr. <HI>Cave on the Life of that Disciple,</HI> Antiquitates Apostolicae, p. 158.</P>
<P>Our Lord, likewise, <Q>used the same words and phrases</Q> unto these <HI>two different subjects,</HI> viz. his <HI>coming</HI> in judgment upon Jerusalem, and his last <HI>coming</HI> to judge the world, <Q>when occasion was to speak of them together,</Q> according to the obser∣vation before quoted from Assemblies Annotations; insomuch that the <HI>day of judgment,</HI> and the <HI>end of the world</HI> were expected to follow immediately after the accomplishment of Christ's prophecies in the xxivth chap. of Matthew, xiiith of Mark, and xxist of Luke concerning <HI>God's judgment in the destruction</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>The latter, however, may indeed be considered as a sign, or type, of the <HI>great and last day;</HI> and the accomplishment of the prophecies concerning it is undoubtedly a sure pledge of <HI>God's future</HI> judgment:
<PB N="35" REF="79"/>
just in the same manner as the <HI>temporary deliverance</HI> from Rezin and Pekah, promised to Ahaz and the house of David by Isaiah, was properly the con∣firmation and pledge of the future distant deliverance promised in the person of <HI>Immanuel.</HI> Therefore if Dr. W—ms supposes (as he hints in the words of Mr. Collins in page 7.) that this sign stood in need of other signs to manifest that God would perform it in time, let him consider the context once more, and he will find, that the sign was not without such a manifestation as Mr. Collins and himself have required. Perhaps it may be said, that I have troubled my readers with a great many more ex∣amples of <HI>"types, figures, and secondary senses,"</HI> than were necessary for the point in question; but I was induced thereto by the too hasty censure passed on these sort of writings by the authors of the <HI>Critical Review</HI> in page 349, where they seem to condemn all <HI>types,</HI> &amp;c. whatsoever indiscriminately, without deigning to distinguish the difference between <HI>pro∣per types</HI> and <HI>imaginary</HI> ones.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>—<HI>Within threescore and five years</HI> shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE accomplishment of Isaiah's prophecy (in confirmation of which he required Ahaz to ask a sign) was not <Q>an event near at hand,</Q> as Dr. W—ms supposes; for no less a term than sixty-five years was allowed for the accomplishment of one of the circumstances con∣tained in it; viz.— <Q><HI>within threescore and five years</HI> shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</Q> Isaiah vii. 8.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the king, or regal government of Ephraim (or Israel, for Ephraim in this text seems to be put for the ten tribes of Israel, as separated
<PB N="4" REF="82"/>
from Judah) lasted no longer than about twenty-one years after the prophecy was delivered; for <HI>"in the ninth year of Hoshea"</HI> (the sixth of Heze∣kiah) <Q>the king of Assyria took Samaria, and car∣ried Israel away into Assyria,</Q> (2 Kings xvii. 6.) therefore commentators have generally found it very difficult to account for the number of <HI>sixty-five years</HI> mentioned in this prophecy.</P>
<P>A very learned and justly esteemed author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Newton on the Prophecies.</NOTE>, in order to solve the difficulty, has applied several texts in the second book of Kings to an imaginary cap∣tivity or carrying away by Esarhaddon, which, if the context be carefully considered, will be found to relate, undoubtedly, to the <HI>real</HI> captivity under Salmanasser. We understand, indeed, from Ezra iv. 2. that the adversaries of Benjamin and Judah (the Samaritans) dated the time of their settlement in the cities of Samaria from <Q>the days of Esar∣haddon king of Assur, which <HI>(as they said)</HI> brought us up hither.</Q> But there is no necessity to suppose, that Esarhaddon carried any people away into captivity from thence, nor any evidence to support such a supposition. Was it not possible for Esarhaddon to plant fresh colonies in the land of Israel, where it was too thinly inhabited by the former colonies, without having carried away any of the inhabitants into captivity? Surely it was not
<PB N="5" REF="83"/>
only possible, but most probable, that this was really the case; notwithstanding that several other learned men, besides Bp. Newton, have thought otherwise; and particularly Fr. Junius, quoted by Dr. Simson in his Chronicon Catholicum (pars 3tia, p. 69.) But the Doctor himself sufficiently accounts for the passages in Ezra (ch. iv. 2 and 10.); so that there is no necessity to suppose another captivity un∣der Esarhaddon:— <Q>Quanquam enim Salmanasar illam coloniam primus deduxerit, tamen cum plu∣rimi incolarum à feris, &amp; fortè pestilentiâ (sic enim ait Josephus libro nono) extincti essent, pos∣tea plures ab Asarhaddone illuc missos fuisse <HI>veri∣simile est.</HI></Q> And he likewise quotes Nicholaus Bra∣bantinus to the same purpose:— <Q>Leones enim vastaverunt magnam partem populi quem Salma∣nassar miserat: propter quod iste Asarhaddon mi∣sit alios loco ipsorum, &amp; cum iis unum de sacerdo∣tibus captivis, qui doceret eos colere Dominum.</Q></P>
<P>The prophet does not say, that <HI>Ephraim shall be broken from a kingdom in sixty-five years,</HI> but that within such a time he shall be <HI>broken from a people;</HI> therefore it is plain that the prophecy could not be accomplished by the captivity of Ephraim, and the destruction of the <HI>regal government</HI> of Samaria by Salmanassar; because Ephraim, or the children of Israel, might be still called <HI>a people,</HI> or nation, even after their removal into a strange country, for they could not be said to <HI>"be broken from a people,"</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="84"/>
until the judgments denounced against them by the prophet Amos (ix. 4.) should be fulfilled, viz. <Q>Though they go into captivity before their ene∣mies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them.</Q></P>
<P>It appears from the history of Tobit, that this really came to pass; for he speaks of the frequent slaughter made of <HI>the people</HI> of <HI>his nation</HI> by Sen∣nacherib, chap. i. 17, 18, <Q>for in his wrath he slew many.</Q> And even in the reign of Esarhad∣don, about <HI>sixty-five years</HI> after Isaiah's prophecy, notwithstanding that Achiarcharus, Tobit's nephew, was appointed over all the king's affairs (21st verse) we find an instance recorded of the continuation of this persecution.</P>
<P>For when Tobit was told (chap. ii. 3.) that one of his nation was strangled, and cast out in the market-place, he remembered (6th verse) <Q><HI>that prophecy of Amos,</HI> as he said (see Amos viii. 10.) Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation:</Q> for it was then the <HI>feast of pentecost,</HI> or seven weeks, and Tobit had sent out to invite such of his poor brethren as feared the Lord, that they <HI>might partake of the "good dinner</HI> which was <HI>prepared;</HI>" but, in the mean time, he received this melancholy account; (see 1st, 2d, and 3d verses) which proves the pro∣priety of his quotation from Amos. The same chapter of Amos contains a passage very suitable to my purpose (viii. 2, 3.)</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="85"/><Q><HI>The end is come upon my people of Israel;</HI> I will not again pass by them any more. And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day,</Q> (see 10th verse, quoted by Tobit— <Q>and all your songs into lamentation) <HI>saith the Lord God, there</HI> shall be many dead bodies <HI>in every place,</HI> they shall cast them forth with silence.</Q> I am sensible that the apocryphal book of Tobit ought not to be considered of sufficient authority for the proof of any thing; yet I hope that the remarkable corre∣spondence it bears to the subject in question, will excuse my quotation.</P>
<P>Moses also prophesied that the captives of Is∣rael should be persecuted;— <Q>I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you.</Q> Levit. xxvi. 33.</P>
<P>So we need not doubt but that, by this and other such heavy judgments of God, the captives of the ten tribes of Israel would be so much reduced in number within the <HI>term of threescore and five years</HI> mentioned by Isaiah, that Ephraim might well be said to <HI>be broken from a people;</HI> for we read in Deut. xxviii. 61, 62. <Q>Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. And ye shall <HI>be left few in number</HI></Q> (which agrees well with the expression of Isaiah concerning Ephraim's being <Q>broken, that it be not a people,</Q> viz. being now left <HI>few in
<PB N="8" REF="86"/>
number</HI>) <Q>whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude.</Q></P>
<P>The completion of Isaiah's prophecy concerning Ephraim is very apparent, even in another way; for though some of Ephraim, and of all the other tribes, were afterwards settled in Judaea and other places; though we read of <HI>a remnant of Israel</HI> (see 2 Chron. xxxiv. 9.) that contributed to the repair∣ing of the temple in the reign of Josiah king of Judah, long after the completion of <HI>the sixty-five years</HI> limited by Isaiah; and though Manasseh and Ephraim are expresly mentioned on the same occa∣sion; nevertheless, this remnant of Ephraim, or Is∣rael, could have no pretensions, as before, to be esteemed a separate people or nation from Judah, because they were once more become subject to the laws and regal government of <HI>the tribe of Judah,</HI> of which the authority exercised among them by Josiah is a sufficient proof; and therefore, notwith∣standing that on some particular occasions they were distinguished by their tribes, yet, as a body or nation, they were generally afterwards esteemed a <HI>part of the tribe of Judah;</HI> which accounts for the expression of the historian (2 Kings xvii. 18.) <HI>"There was none left but the tribe of Judah only;"</HI> that is, there was none left but part of the tribes of Levi, Benjamin, and such individuals of the other tribes as lived in (or might have escaped into) the inheritance of Judah, and consequently were
<PB N="9" REF="87"/>
all considered as the proper subjects of <HI>the kingdom of Judah,</HI> and have ever since borne <HI>the name of that tribe,</HI> viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Jews.</HI> Thus the title of <HI>Jews</HI> became general about this time to all the other tribes, as well as Judah; for the kingdom <HI>of Israel</HI> was never afterwards restored in a separate state from Judah; and therefore after the captivity by Salmanassar, <HI>the land which Ahaz vexed</HI> might be said to <HI>"be forsaken of"</HI> one of <HI>"her kings,"</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of BOTH HER KINGS." Isaiah vii. 16.</NOTE> or regal governments.</P>
<P>But the succession of the kings of Judah con∣tinued regularly until the Babylonish captivity; and on account of this interruption (or of others after∣wards) the land could not be said to be <HI>forsaken of both her kings,</HI> if the regal government was to be afterwards restored for any considerable length of time: and we find <HI>that many kings reigned in Judah</HI> after that period. I have already observed, that, when <HI>Ephraim</HI> was <HI>broken from a people,</HI> the natio∣nal name of <HI>Jews</HI> became general to all the other tribes, as well as Judah; but it is likewise remark∣able, that about the same time the whole Jewish nation (including Judah and Benjamin) as descend∣ants of Jacob, began once more to be called <HI>Israel,</HI> as they had formerly been before the revolt of the
<PB N="10" REF="88"/>
ten tribes. In the second book of Chron. xxxv. 3. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">—"And said unto the Levites that taught <HI>all Israel,</HI> which were holy unto the Lord, Put the holy ark in the house, &amp;c.—serve now the Lord your God and <HI>his people Israel.</HI>" 2 Chron. xxxv. 3.</NOTE> the Levites, that taught <HI>all Israel,</HI> are exhorted to serve the Lord their God, and <HI>his people Israel;</HI> meaning the whole nation.

<P>Nevertheless, <HI>all the nation</HI> were <HI>the children of Israel! all were Jews!</HI> and in length of time the <HI>remnant of Israel</HI> was so blended with <HI>Judah,</HI> that many intirely lost the distinction of their tribes

(Ezra ii. 62. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found."

There are likewise several other parts of that learned book, which would both illustrate and confirm many of the points which I have advanced; nevertheless, as I cannot entirely agree with him in all his opinions, and as I had finished my remarks (except a short addition at the end of this Dissertation) before I had the satisfaction of reading his work, I shall therefore content myself with referring my readers to the book itself.</NOTE>, as the Asmonaean princes of the tribe of Levi: for not only the descendants of the twelve tribes were called Jews after the Baby∣lonish captivity (as I have before observed) but even the <HI>proselytes of the</HI> Jews, though they were by birth <HI>Gentiles</HI> of any other nation whatsoever.</P>
<P>This is strongly expressed by Josephus, in his account of king Izates, the great Adiabenian pro∣selyte. See Jewish Antiquities, (20th book <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Orleans edition of Josephus, printed in 1611 (fol. 685.) which is referred to as often us Josephus is quoted in these remarks.</NOTE>) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

(or Edomites <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Thou shalt not abhor an</HI> Edomite, for he is thy brother.</Q> Deut. xxiii. 7.—i. e.—The patriarch Edom (which is Esau, see Gen. xxv. 30.) was Jacob's brother.</NOTE>) from whom Herod was descended, were not only proselytes to the Jewish religion, but were still more nearly connected with the Jews, by having been governed by the same princes and laws, from the time that they were conquered by John Hyrcanus, the nephew of Judas Maccabaeus; <HI>so that from that time they were accounted Jews,</HI> as Josephus testifies. Antiq. 13th book, 17th chap. fol. 450. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And they were afterwards as zealous for the rights and liberties of Jerusalem (which they esteemed <HI>their metropolitan city</HI>) as the native Jews themselves. See Jewish War, book iv. chap. 16. page 887.—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Thus it appears that the Idumaeans, as a nation, had certainly a right to be esteemed <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>But king Herod's claim of relationship did not depend upon this single circumstance of his being descended from the Idumaeans. His connections with the Jews were far greater than any other Idumaean could ever boast of! His father Antipater, though an Idumaean, was a person of such trust and esteem among the Jews, that he held the greatest offices under their kings.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="95"/>He served under their king Alexander <HI>as governor of Idumaea,</HI> (Antiq. book xiv. chap. 2. p. 469.) —under their king and high-priest Hyrcanus as <HI>governor of Judaea itself, and commander in chief of the Jewish army.</HI> And afterwards he served under Caesar also, as <HI>procurator of Judae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> See the xivth and xvth chapters of the same book.</P>
<P>Therefore, not only as an Idumaean, but also by these continual connections, as well as residence among the Jews, Antipater seemed to be entirely naturalized to this people; insomuch that he esteemed their interest as his own; their country as though it had been <HI>his native land!</HI> His assiduity and diligence in repairing the walls of Jerusalem (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, book xiv. chap. 18.) when he had obtained leave of Caesar to do so, is a proof of this, as well as Josephus's manner of expressing that circumstance. <HI>Jewish War,</HI> book i. chap. 8. viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—Thus rendered by Rufinus— <Q>et praeter hoc (Antipater) impe∣travit, ut subversa <HI>patriae</HI> moenia renovare sibi liceret.</Q> And again, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Anti∣pater vero, ubi de Syria Caesarem prosecutus est, in <HI>Judaeam</HI> reversus, <HI>ante omnia</HI> PATRIAE <HI>muros</HI> a Pom∣pëio dirutos reparabat.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="96"/>If all these circumstances are considered, it will not be easy to prove, that the <HI>son</HI> of such a person ought to be accounted a foreigner to the Jews. Herod was born a subject of the kingdom of the Jews, and publickly professed their religion, laws, and customs, notwithstanding that he frequently offended against them all: and if he did not think himself, in reality, intitled to be esteemed one of that nation, he nevertheless omitted no proper oppor∣tunity of claiming relationship. A remarkable instance of this we have in his speech to the Jews, when he proposed to enlarge and beautify their temple. <Q>For (said he) <HI>our fathers</HI> built this temple to Almighty God after the return from Babylon,</Q> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Jewish Antiq. book xv. chap. 14. p. 543.</P>
<P>There are many other instances in Josephus of Herod's expressing himself in this manner: and indeed the singular circumstances of this monarch's connections with the Jews rendered his claim of relationship so just, that it could not be disputed, although he was not descended of any of the twelve tribes. Josephus, who called Herod's father (An∣tipater) <HI>an Idumaean,</HI> does not deny that he was a Jew, but only that he <HI>was not descended from the chief Jews, who came into Judaea from Babylon,</HI> which had been asserted by Nicholas of Damascus.
<PB N="8" REF="97"/>
Antiq. book xiv. chap. 2. p. 469. On the con∣trary, Josephus informs us, that, when the Jews of Caesarea contended with the Syrians for the right of superiority in that city, they alledged that the founder, <HI>Herod their king, was a Jew by birth;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<P>If all these things be considered, I think, they must justify my expression, that Herod had as much right to be esteemed <HI>a Jew,</HI> as the <HI>Asmonaean princes of the tribe of Levi:</HI> and though neither the latter, nor Herod (notwithstanding that <HI>they were Jews</HI>) were really descended of the tribe of Judah; yet the completion of Jacob's prophecy, concerning the sceptre of Judah, is not at all affected by this cir∣cumstance.</P>
<P>For the said prophecy does not (I apprehend) so much relate to the descent or genealogy of the in∣dividuals that were to rule in Judah, as to the par∣ticular pre-eminence of that whole tribe, from which the sceptre (the sign of its being a distinct kingdom)
<PB N="9" REF="98"/>
should not depart till Shiloh was come. Therefore it is not so very material to my present purpose, whether Herod was a Jew or not, since it must be acknowledged (be his parentage what it will) that he was nevertheless <HI>"king of Judaea,"</HI> as Luke stiles him chap. i. verse 5. viz. king of the <HI>tribe and inheritance of Judah</HI> (as well as of the other tribes incorporated therein) and that he kept his royal residence in <HI>the capital city of that ruling tribe,</HI> as did all the preceding kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> howsoever descended.</P>
<P>An objection has been made to the common interpretation of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>sceptre</HI> in Ja∣cob's prophecy; viz. that <Q>it could not with any sort of propriety be said, that <HI>the scepter should not depart from Judah,</HI> when Judah had no scepter, nor was to have any for many gene∣rations afterwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bishop Newton on the Prophecies. Vol. i. p. 95.</NOTE>.</Q> But the learned author of this objection has not considered that the sceptre or regal government in Judah is plainly <HI>implied and foretold in the former part of the same prophecy,</HI> which entirely removes the force of his argument in favour of a different interpretation of that word. <Q><HI>Judah</HI> (said the patriarch) thou art he whom <HI>thy brethren shall praise</HI></Q> (alluding to the meaning of his name) <Q>thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies: <HI>thy father's children shall bow down before thee.</HI></Q> Gen. xlix. 8.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="99"/>Now, notwithstanding the precedency of the tribe of Judah in the encampments and marching of the Israelites in the wilderness, yet this part of the pro∣phecy <Q>thy father's children shall bow down before thee,</Q> cannot be said to be fulfilled, until all the other tribes became subject to the monarchy of the tribe of Judah under David and Solomon; which is observed likewise by the authors of the Commen∣tary on the Bible, called Assemblies Annotations. "This" (say they) <Q>was literally most verified in David and Solomon, who were of this tribe; and spiritually in Christ, the <HI>lion of the tribe of Judah,</HI> Rev. v. 5. to whom all knees shall bow.</Q> Phil. ii. 10.—And they observe further, that <Q>the courage of Judah is compared to a lion's whelp; such was the tribe of Judah in the first essays of war in the time of Joshua; afterwards it increased to the vigour of a lion at full age, and old, in comparison of a whelp; such it was in David's time, and by age and experience subtle, as well as strong; for David of that tribe was so wise, that Saul was afraid of his wisdom, (1 Sam. xviii. 5.14, 15.) and very couragious (see 1 Sam. xvii. from ver. 32 to 51.) as the lion above other beasts, who, by his courage and strength, <HI>is a king over them.</HI></Q> Num. xxiii. 24. Prov. xxviii. 1. and xxx. 30. Amos iii. 8. Mic. v. 8.</P>
<P>If all this be considered, it will appear that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in this text must be translated <HI>a sceptre;</HI> which is
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
the opinion likewise of Mons.

<P>Thus it is plain that the <HI>regal sceptre</HI> was not <HI>to depart from the tribe of Judah</HI> till Shiloh was come.</P>
<P>Now the Messiah was not born until towards the close of <HI>king Herod's</HI> reign, therefore the <HI>sceptre of Judah</HI> could not be said to depart, or begin to de∣part (<HI>"be departing,"</HI> as some commentators have fancied) before that period. Neither could the <HI>the land which Ahaz vexed</HI> be said to <Q>be forsaken of both her kings,</Q> or monarchies, whilst Herod continued to reign in Jerusalem. But <HI>immediately after his death,</HI> the form of government was entirely altered. There was no longer <HI>a sceptre</HI> in the tribe or inheritance of Judah! The Jews had now no other <HI>worldly king but Caesar;</HI> for <HI>the peculiar sceptre of Judah</HI> was departed. They were indeed subject <HI>to a sceptre,</HI> but it was the <HI>Roman sceptre;</HI> which could not on this account be called the <HI>Sceptre of Judah;</HI> and therefore it is plain that at this time
<PB N="12" REF="101"/>
the sceptre departed from Judah. A solemn lega∣tion of fifty ambassadors from Jerusalem (who were backed by eight thousand Jews at Rome) sollicited Caesar that their regal government might be changed, and that they might be added to the pro∣vince of Syria, and become subject to the Roman commanders that should be sent there.—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. See Antiq. p. 611, 612. See also p. 781, 782. where the same thing is strongly expressed.</P>
<P>Nevertheless Caesar did not at that time entirely comply with their request; for as Archelaus was named by his father Herod to be his successor in the kingdom, Caesar was pleased to grant him the half of Herod's dominions, but <HI>not as a kingdom;</HI> for he allowed him the title only of Ethnarch; and as such Archelaus had no more rigth to the <HI>ensign of royalty</HI> spoken of by the patriarch Jacob in the 49th chapter of Genesis, than he had to the <HI>title and dignity of a king,</HI> which were <HI>never conferred</HI> on him, though promised conditionally.</P>

<P>In the mean time Herod Antipas, another son of Herod the Great, was tetrarch of Galilee. It was this Herod who beheaded John the Baptist in his territory of Galilee, and whose crafty, base, and self-interested disposition was characterized by the Messiah himself under the simile of <HI>a fox:</HI> for in detestation of such <HI>pernicious principles</HI> he even named him from that wily animal. <Q>Go and tell <HI>that fox,</HI></Q> &amp;c. To this man was Christ sent by Pontius Pilate; not because Herod Antipas had any judicial authority in Jerusalem, but because Christ was accounted <HI>a Galilean,</HI> and therefore Pilate

sent him, as being one that belonged unto <HI>Herod's jurisdiction.</HI> See St. Luke xxiii 6, 7 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">— <Q>when Pilate heard of <HI>Galilee,</HI> he asked whether the man (Jesus) were <HI>a Galilean.</HI> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto <HI>Herod's jurisdiction,</HI> he <HI>sent him to Herod,</HI> who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Judaea was, indeed, <HI>spiritually the kingdom of the Messiah,</HI> of which many incontestable proofs are inserted throughout this work, and compared with the predictions of the prophets; but with respect to its temporal or civil government, it was so far from <HI>being a kingdom</HI> at this time, that it was only considered as a part of the province of Syria; and for above thirty years together was governed by a regular succession of Roman procurators <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Josephus informs us, that Valerius Gratus, successor to Annius Rufus, was the fifth governor of the Jews; and that he was succeeded by Pontius Pilate—"<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>."—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

appear otherwise. Though Agrippa enjoyed the title, pomp, and appearance of a king, he was nevertheless subjected in no small degree (as well as his predecessors the Roman procurators) to the controul of the Roman president of Syria <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Antiq. book xviii. chap. 15. p. 615. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.</NOTE>.—For when he had undertaken thoroughly to repair and compleat the fortifications of Jerusalem, Marsus the president of Syria had a watchful eye over him, and signified his distrust to Caesar, who caused him to desist. Antiq. book xix. chap. 7. p. 677.— And afterwards Marsus exerted his authority as president in a very remarkable manner, even <HI>in the dominions of Agrippa, when the king himself was resi∣dent therein;</HI> for being jealous of the friendship and unity between Agrippa and several of the neigh∣bouring potentates, who were come to visit him at Tiberias, <HI>he sent and commanded them all to depart to their respective governments, which was a matter of the greatest mortification to Agrippa.</HI>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. book xix. chap. 7. p. 678.</P>
<P>These are proofs that Agrippa's power as a king was very much circumscribed in comparison with that of Herod the Great. Herod was so far from
<PB N="16" REF="105"/>
being subject to the controul of the presidents of Syria, that he himself was made president of <HI>all Syria</HI> by Caesar; (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) who directed the several governors to do nothing without his counsel and advice. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<P>On the other hand, likewise, the reign of Agrippa was so very short in comparison of the time that the sceptre had been departed from Judah, that, I think, it can scarcely be considered as an exception either to the prophecy of Jacob, or to this of Isaiah, concerning <HI>the two kings;</HI> especially as Agrippa was cut off from his kingdom by a very remarkable interposition of Divine Providence: for after he had slain St. James (the brother of St. John) im∣prisoned St. Peter, and otherwise grievously per∣secuted the Christians, he fulfilled the measure of his iniquity by accepting the idolatrous flattery of the people at Caesarea; <Q>and immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten up of worms, and gave up the ghost;</Q> (Acts xii. 23.) having reigned over Judah only <HI>three years</HI> according to Josephus, who, in the 19th book of his Antiquities, chap. 7. p. 679, confirms the account given by St. Luke, though in some particulars his relation is different. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>

<P>Agrippa the younger afterwards obtained the kingdom of Chalcis <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Antiq. book xx. chap. 3. p. 690.

But it is remarkable, that before this short reign the Jews had not only sollicited Caesar by a solemn legation of fifty ambassadors (as I have before observed in page 32.) that their nation might no longer be governed by kings, but their chief priests had likewise publickly abrogated all pretensions that their nation could have <HI>to any peculiar sceptre of</HI> their own: for when Pilate brought forth Jesus in the presence of the main body of the people, who were assembled at Jeru∣salem on account of the passover, and said, <Q>Be∣hold your king;</Q> and again, <Q>Shall I crucify your king?</Q> they answered,—We have <HI>no other king but Caesar.</HI> St. John xix. 14, 15.</P>

<P>Perhaps some critic may object, that, as Christ was undoubtedly <HI>king of Israel and Judah,</HI> the sceptre of Judah cannot be said to depart at the death of Herod according to the interpretation just now given of the patriarch Jacob's prophecy: therefore it is necessary for me to observe, that the <HI>sceptre</HI> spoken of in this prophecy, and the ceasing of the two kings or regal governments, spoken of by Isaiah, can only be understood to mean the de∣parture of the <HI>worldly sceptre,</HI> and <HI>temporal regal authority</HI> from Judah and Israel, as necessarily to be

distinguished from the <HI>spiritual authority, and hea∣venly kingdom</HI> of Christ; for as Christ was <Q>born king of the Jews,</Q> so the sceptre of Judah with respect to him is not departed, but is everlasting, according to the prophecy of the Royal Psalmist concerning Christ's kingdom. <Q>Thy throne, <HI>O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre</HI> of thy king∣dom is <HI>a right sceptre.</HI> Thou lovest righteous∣ness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</Q> Psalm xlv. 6, 7.</P>
<P>The other part of Jacob's prophecy concerning Judah (viz. <HI>"nor a lawgiver from between his feet"</HI>) does not relate (I apprehend) to the sceptre or regal government of Judah; for the particle <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (rendered <HI>"nor"</HI> in the common English version, which divides these words from the former part of the sentence) seems to point out, that two distinct things are here spoken of, as Mons.

Judah might likewise be properly called <HI>a lawgiver</HI> (Psalms lx. 7. cviii. 8.) because <HI>the Messiah</HI> was to be born of that tribe. But the Scribes and Pharisees, or the Sanhedrin, were not sent by God with any fur∣ther revelation, than what had before been given by Moses and the Prophets; and therefore, though they sat in Moses' seat (Matt. xxiii. 2.) yet they could not properly be called lawgivers; being only <HI>lawyers or expounders</HI> of the law of Moses: and, if no person among the Jews for above seventeen hun∣dred years has had a better claim to the title of lawgiver than these, it must plainly appear that the lawgiver (as well as the sceptre) is departed from Judah; and consequently, that the Messiah came before that time. Malachi is the last person whom the Jews acknowledge as a prophet in their canon of the Scriptures; and it is remarkable that Al∣mighty God was pleased to comfort them by this holy <HI>messenger</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) with the promise of another

<P>Compare the said prophecy with that of Daniel ix. 26, 27.</P>
<P>But though this great and dreadful day of the Lord is certainly past, yet the Jews do not allow that the promised Elijah is yet come. Nevertheless they sent Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to enquire of John the Baptist— <Q>Who art thou? —Art thou Elias?</Q> and he saith, I am not. Art "thou that prophet?" (meaning most likely that prophet promised by Moses in Deut. xviii. 15 and 18 verses, who was afterwards acknowledged by about five thousand Jews at one time; for so many were joint witnesses of one of his miracles, being convinced by all their senses of <HI>seeing, hearing,</HI> and <HI>tasting</HI>) and he answered <HI>no.</HI></P>
<P>But notwithstanding that John was a different person from Elijah the prophet, according to his
<PB N="26" REF="115"/>
own confession, yet he was most certainly the pro∣phet promised by <HI>Malachi</HI> under the prophetical appellation of <HI>Elijah,</HI> which denoted the excellency of his spiritual mission; for the angel Gabriel told his father Zacharias in the temple, that John should go before the Lord in the <HI>"spirit and power of Elias."</HI> See St. Luke i. 17.

<P>John was likewise a lawgiver (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) as well as a prophet and messenger; for <Q><HI>there went out to him</HI> Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region round <HI>about Jordan.</HI></Q> Matth. iii. 5. And when he warned them to flee from the wrath to come, <Q>the people asked him, saying, what shall we do then?</Q> (Luke iii. 10.) and we find by the succeed∣ing verses that he instructed them accordingly, not only with general doctrine, but even with particular advice suitable to the different classes of men. These testimonies of the Evangelists in favour of John are confirmed in no small degree even by the <HI>Jewish historian</HI> Josephus, who calls him <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a good man</Q> —for indeed his life and conversa∣tion
<PB N="27" REF="116"/>
was so exemplary and unblameable, that many of the Jews (as Josephus informs us) believed the destruction of Herod's army to be a just judgment of God for the murder of that <HI>good man</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Of whom Josephus, in the place above quoted, gives us the following character: that his whole crime was his exhorting the Jews to the love and practice of virtue; and, first of all, to piety, justice, and regenera∣tion, or newness of life; not by the bare abstinence from this or that particular sin, but by an habitual purity of mind and body.</Q></P>
<P>"Now" (continues he) <Q>so great was the credit and authority of this holy man, as appears by the multitude of his disciples, and the veneration they had for his doc∣trine (for he could do what he would with them) that Herod, not knowing how far the reputation of a man of his spirit might influence the people toward a revolt, resolved at length to take him off before it was too late,</Q> &amp;c. He adds, <Q>that Herod was very unsuccessful in his war with the Arabian king; all which the Jews looked upon as a just judgment of God upon him for that im∣pious murder.</Q> <HI>Univ.

<P>John was not, indeed, of the tribe of Judah, yet it cannot be denied, but that he was <HI>a Jew,</HI> according to what has been before observed con∣cerning the Asmonaean princes, and <Q>Herod the king of Judea</Q> (Luke i. 5.): and he might very well be accounted a <HI>lawgiver from between the feet of Judah,</HI> for he was born in the <HI>hill country of Judea</HI> (Luke i. 65.) in a <HI>city of Juda</HI> (Luke i. 39.
<PB N="28" REF="117"/>
at a time <HI>when that tribe was in full possession of its inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>But the circumstance which more particularly points out the accomplishment of Jacob's prophecy in this holy Nazarite <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John was a <Q><HI>Nazarite</HI> unto God from his mother's womb,</Q> as Sampson, one of the <HI>judges</HI> of Israel, had been before him. (Compare Judges xvi. 17. with St. Luke i. 15.) But Christ could not properly be called a Nazarite (as Dr. W—ms supposes him to be) without a contra∣diction to the usual sense of that title in the Jewish law.</NOTE> is, that John was the very last of the <HI>Jewish lawgivers or prophets.</HI> For though, on extraordinary occasions, some prophetical sen∣tences may have been uttered by men adhering to Judaism, after the coming of Christ (such as the remarkable prophecy of Caiaphas the high-priest concerning Christ— <Q>that it was expedient that one man should die for the people,</Q> &amp;c. (John xi. 50.) <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See what a manifest (though unwilling) testimony, even <HI>the unbelieving Jews</HI> bare of Christ's heavenly mission. — <Q>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, <HI>What do we?</HI> for <HI>this man doeth many miracles.</HI> If we thus let him alone, <HI>all men will believe on him;</HI> and the Romans <HI>shall come and take away both our place and nation.</HI> And one of them named Caiaphas, being <HI>the high-priest</HI> that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us, <HI>that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</HI> And this spake he not of him∣self: but being high-priest that year, <HI>he prophesied</HI> that Jesus should die for that nation,</Q> &amp;c. John xi. 47—51.</NOTE> yet the Jews cannot prove that a single prophet
<PB N="29" REF="118"/>
(professedly as such) has been sent to them from God ever since the time of John; that is, for above 1700 years; except they will condescend to allow to St. Paul, Agabus, and others of the primitive Christians, the title of prophets: but these were under the dispensation of the New Testament, after the ceremonial and typical law was annulled, and therefore cannot be reckoned among the <HI>Jewish</HI> lawgivers or prophets.</P>
<P>This was confirmed by Christ himself (Luke xvi. 16.) "the <HI>law</HI> and the <HI>prophets</HI> were <HI>until John.</HI>" —And again (Matth. xi. 12, 13.) <Q><HI>for</HI> all the prophets <HI>and</HI> the law prophesied until John.</Q></P>
<P>These are sufficient authorities, I hope, to justify my supposition, that the <HI>prophet</HI> and <HI>lawgiver de∣parted from Judah</HI> at the death of John the Baptist; or rather, was gradually departing for some time before his death: because as <HI>Christ increased, John decreased,</HI> according to his own prophecy recorded by John the Evangelist, (iii. 30.) <Q>Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, <HI>I am not the Christ,</HI> but that I am sent before him. He that hath <HI>the bride</HI></Q> (that is, <HI>the church</HI> or congregation; for John had just before been told that Christ <Q>bap∣tizeth, <HI>and</HI> all men come to him,</Q> 26th verse) <Q>is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bride∣groom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy is therefore fulfilled. He <HI>must increase,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="119"/>
but I <HI>must decrease</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><Q>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized <HI>more disciples</HI> than John (though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples) he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</Q> John iv. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven, is above all. And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal, that God is true. For he whom God hath sent speak∣eth the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <HI>(unto him).</HI> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far the Evangelist seems to be relating the testimony of John, the second Elias.</P>
<P>In the 5th chapter (31st verse) of the same Evan∣gelist we read, that this remarkable testimony was afterwards referred to by Christ himself. <Q>If I bear witness of myself (said Christ) my witness is not true. There <HI>is another</HI> that beareth witness of me, and I know that the witness which he wit∣nesseth of me, is true. <HI>Ye sent unto John,</HI> and
<PB N="31" REF="120"/>
he bare witness unto the truth. But I receive <HI>not testimony from man:</HI></Q> — nevertheless our Lord condescended to give the Jews an opportunity of being convinced by <HI>the testimony of man,</HI> a man, whom they almost universally esteemed on account of the purity of his life, which I have already shewn from the authority even of the <HI>Jewish</HI> historian Josephus.</P>
<P>The mercy of God, therefore, is apparent in this condescension; and though our Lord himself de∣clared, that he received not <HI>"testimony from man;"</HI> yet he added—<HI>"but these things"</HI> (relating to John's testimony) <HI>"I say, that ye might be saved."</HI></P>
<P>He then gives a most lively and comprehensive (though short) description of the holy character of this his harbinger. <HI>"He was"</HI> (says our Lord) <HI>"a burning, and a shining light;"</HI>—and he re∣minds the Jews, that they formerly testified a very particular approbation of this holy person: <Q>and ye were willing</Q> (says he) <Q>for a season <HI>to rejoice in his light.</HI> But I have greater witness than that of <HI>John:</HI> for <HI>the works</HI> which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, <HI>bear witness</HI> of me, that the Father hath sent me. <HI>And the Father himself,</HI> which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. And ye have not <HI>his word</HI> abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. <HI>Search
<PB N="32" REF="121"/>
the Scriptures,</HI> for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me.</Q> Thus Christ pointed out to the Jews three incontestible indications of the truth of his holy doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1st. The testimony of John the Baptist, with which he <HI>indulged</HI> them, though the same might be esteemed unnecessary for the cause of him, who "<HI>receives not testimony</HI> from man."</P>
<P N="2">2dly. His own <HI>mighty works,</HI> daily wrought among them, which, as he said, <Q><HI>bear witness</HI> of me, that the Father hath sent me.</Q></P>
<P>And 3dly. The <HI>witness of the Father himself,</HI> though (as Christ expressed himself to the Jews) <Q>Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape;</Q> but he seems plainly to direct them to that <HI>witness of God,</HI> which has in all ages been apparent in the accomplishment of the <HI>word of the Lord by his prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Even the unbelieving Jews themselves pretended to believe <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> and acknowledged them to be <HI>the word of God;</HI> and therefore Christ referred them to the Scriptures, as being <HI>the witness</HI> of the Father himself. <HI>"Search the Scriptures,"</HI> &amp;c. But they wilfully neglected to make a right use of such ample testimony; and were, therefore, inex∣cusable. "Do not think" (said Christ) <Q>that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, <HI>even Moses in whom ye trust.</HI> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed
<PB N="33" REF="122"/>
me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not <HI>his writings,</HI> how shall ye believe my words?</Q></P>
<P>In the very next chapter (vi. 1, 2.) the Evan∣gelist relates the accomplishment of one of the circumstances of Jacob's prophecy, as recorded by Moses; viz.— <Q>and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.</Q></P>
<P>"After these things" (says St. John) <Q>Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tibe∣rias, and A GREAT MULTITUDE FOLLOWED HIM, <HI>because they saw his miracles,</HI></Q> &amp;c. And again (14th and 15th verses) "then those men" (the five thousand persons, who were fed by Christ with five barley loaves and two small fishes) <Q>when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet <HI>that should come into</HI> the world. When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and <HI>take him by force, to make him a king</HI></Q> (for they could not possibly give him a greater proof of their sincerity in <HI>gathering to him</HI> as the true Shiloh) <Q>he departed again into a mountain him∣self alone.</Q></P>
<P>The people of Israel (as Mr. Mann observes in his learned treatise de Anno Natali Christi, p. 4.) were not the only people that were to be <HI>gathered</HI> unto Shiloh; not one nation only is pointed at in the prophecy, <HI>but many nations.</HI> The patriarch's words were not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the gathering <HI>of this people,</HI> or nation, but in the plural number <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the gathering <HI>of the nations;</HI> which has been
<PB N="34" REF="123"/>
apparently fulfilled: for the nations have at dif∣ferent times almost universally submitted to the faith of our Lord Jesus, the true Shiloh; notwith∣standing that many have since fallen back into gross ignorance, superstition, and unbelief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have a dreadful example of this in the present state of the once enlightened Grecian empire, of the greatest part of Asia, and of almost the whole vast continent of Africa. Nay, the greatest part even of Europe itself hath long since resumed the veil of its former darkness, and the shadow of death: for the superstitious vanities of Rome bear too great a resemblance to the old Heathen idolatries; and the multitude of Atheists, Deists, and of those who neglect Christ's holy sacraments, is an alarming indication of a <HI>falling off</HI> even among ourselves.</NOTE>. The <HI>gather∣ing of the people</HI> to impostors does not at all affect the certainty of the sign given by the patriarch Jacob in <HI>the gathering of the people</HI> to Shiloh.</P>
<P>Many false Christs have indeed appeared accord∣ing to our Lord's prediction in Matthew xxiv. 24 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets; and shall shew great signs and wonders, insomuch that (if it were possible) they shall deceive the very elect. <HI>Behold, I have told you before,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<PB N="35" REF="124"/>
foretold by St. Paul) <Q>that they should believe a lie.</Q> 2 Thess. ii. 11.</P>
<P>The same people, who rejected the <HI>truth</HI> through <HI>hardness of heart,</HI> and <HI>want of faith,</HI> very soon afterwards, by a <HI>contrary</HI> infatuation, rendered them∣selves despicable by the most <HI>absurd credulity.</HI></P>
<P>Even the <HI>Jewish</HI> historian Josephus gives ample testimony of the proneness of his countrymen to error and false doctrine, and that they were easily led away by impostors and deceivers. He relates a very remarkable instance of it, in their being led out by an Egyptian to the mount of Olives; from whence he had undertaken to shew them a won∣derful spectacle, viz. that the walls of Jerusalem should fall at his command <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Antiq. book xx. chap. 6. p. 695.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The same spiritual blindness continued even after <HI>the abomination of desolation,</HI> notwithstanding the apparent judgment of God upon them, in the de∣struction of their great (and once holy) city: for they have (as readily since that time, as before) acknowledged the incredible pretensions of several impostors, who have at different times set themselves up for the true Messiah. For instance, the infamous Barchocheba (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or, <HI>Son of a Star</HI>) in the reign of the emperor Adrian, was gladly received, and zealously supported among the Jews, until an immense slaughter of his miserable adherents plainly demonstrated that he was more properly intitled Bar∣chozba

(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>Son of a Lie.</HI> The Jews were also notably deceived by Sabbatei Sevi, who wick∣edly took upon himself the character of the Messiah. But it is remarkable, that it was the Jews alone, and not <HI>all the other nations of the world,</HI> that were gathered to these counterfeits; which ought to de∣monstrate to the <HI>present house of Israel</HI> the apparent difference between the true Messiah, and the miser∣able deceivers above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Thus, I hope, I have shewn, that the sceptre did not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from be∣tween his feet, <HI>until Shiloh was come;</HI> and that <HI>the gathering of the people</HI> (not of one nation only, but <HI>of the universe</HI> at different times) has been unto Christ himself, according to the Scriptures.</P>
<P><Q>Bring forth the blind people that <HI>have eyes,</HI> and the <HI>deaf</HI> that <HI>have ears.</HI> Let <HI>all the nations</HI> be <HI>ga∣thered together,</HI> and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things?

<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO SOME OF THE Principal Arguments used by Dr. W—MS IN DEFENCE OF HIS CRITICAL DISSERTATION ON ISAIAH vii. 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp;c. IN WHICH The opinions of the late Dr. SYKES, and Dr. GEORGE BENSON, concerning <HI>Accommodations</HI> of Scripture Prophecy, <HI>are briefly</HI> considered.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="127"/>AN ANSWER TO Some of the principal Arguments used by Dr. W—MS in Defence of his Critical Disser∣tation on ISAIAH vii. 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE pointed out to Dr. W—ms several mistakes in his Critical Dissertation on Isaiah vii. 13, 14, 15, 16; yet he hath not thought proper to acknowledge one of them, though he has laboured to disprove several. Some of the principal arguments which the Doctor has advanced in favour of his hypothesis are considered in the following pages.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to a defence of my remarks, it may be necessary for me to examine a very im∣portant question concerning the interpretation of Scripture prophecies, notwithstanding that Dr. W—ms apprehends the same to be <Q>sufficiently <HI>and even</HI> conclusively decided already;</Q> viz. Whether any "allegorical meanings, and double senses of "Scripture prophecies are to be allowed?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="128"/><Q>It is impossible (says the Dr.) to determine when any prophecy is fulfilled, if it has more than one single sense. If it has two (says he) it may have two hundred, and all of them equally just.</Q></P>
<P>For the confirmation of this sentiment, he refers me to Dr. George Benson's preface to the first volume of his paraphrase and notes on St. Paul's Epistles, and to Dr. Sykes's Connexion of natural and revealed Religion, page 217, &amp;c.</P>
<P>These I have examined with as much care, I be∣lieve, as is necessary, and find, that the third objection to Dr. George Benson's hypothesis, quoted even in his own Introduction, p. xxxiv. obliges him to make such large concessions concerning types and figures, that—notwithstanding his great zeal against double fenses, his denying of them seems a mere disagree∣ment in terms, and not in effect, from the general received opinion.</P>
<P>In his answer to the said objection, he allows, p. xxxv. <Q>That, wherever the <HI>law</HI> or the <HI>Prophets</HI> have declared, that the rites and ceremonies of <HI>the Mosaic constitution</HI> were intended to point out a moral obligation, or to prefigure the <HI>Messiah,</HI> or something in the Christian dispensation, there that moral intention, or prophetic prefiguration, is the one, true sense of the text, &amp;c.</Q> See the Doctor's answer at length in p. xxxv.</P>
<P>Here he plainly allows of a direct application, in some cases, to the antitype; which he calls <Q>the
<PB N="5" REF="129"/>
one true sense of the text.</Q> —But how (as a rea∣sonable man) he can possibly avoid acknowledging the necessary consequence of this his concession, I leave all candid readers to judge: for if there is an allegorical sense alluding to the antitype (which he calls "a <HI>moral intention</HI> or <HI>prophetic prefiguration</HI>") there must certainly be, likewise, a <HI>literal sense</HI> ap∣plicable <HI>to the type itself.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the Doctor has in that place refined his argument to so small a thread, that it becomes almost imperceptible.</P>
<P>The next objection quoted by Dr. Benson, is as follows. — Object. IV. <Q>Are not many pas∣sages in the New Testament taken from the Old Testament, and used in a quite different sense from what they have, as they stand in the original writer? and must not these be called double senses of the words of sacred Scripture?</Q></P>
<P>To this the Doctor answers, — <Q>It is acknowledged, that our Lord, and his Apostles and Evangelists, have taken several passages from the Old Testament; and used them in a very different sense from what they have, as connected with the place from whence they were taken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But that will not prove a double sense of the words. I may quote a passage from <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil, Herodotus</HI> or <HI>Livy,</HI> to express my present meaning, and in quite another sense from what it has in those antient authors. But that will not
<PB N="6" REF="130"/>
prove that those antient authors intended their words should be understood in two senses. In the original intention they had only one meaning. In <HI>my accommodation of them,</HI> they have only one meaning. And though the same words may have different ideas affixed to them; and be used, by successive speakers, or writers, in various senses; yet that does not prove that, in the original in∣tention, they had more than one signification.</Q></P>
<P>Now I readily allow, that Dr. Benson's idea of <HI>an accommodation</HI> is certainly true in such cases as he has supposed, viz. in quotations from <HI>Homer or Virgil, &amp;c.</HI> <Q>To express a present meaning in quite another sense from what it has in those antient authors.</Q> And I as readily assent to a part of Dr. W—ms quotation in page 41 of his Critical Dissertation from a very learned author, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. GREGORY SHARPE.—See his second argument in Defence of Christianity taken from the ancient prophecies, page 349.</P>
<P>The sentence which immediately follows the above extract, ought by no means to be omitted when the author's sentiments on this head are quoted, viz.</P>
<P><Q>But indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from prophane authors and the prophets.</Q></P></NOTE> viz. that when <Q>passages in the Grecian poets are cited, or alluded to, in the writings of the New,</Q> or Old
<PB N="7" REF="131"/>
"Testament," the same <Q>are not to be considered as prophecies.</Q> For indeed they cannot other∣wise be esteemed than as <Q>a mere accommodation of phrases.</Q></P>
<P>But when the <HI>word of the Lord by his prophets,</HI> or (as St. Matthew warily expresses himself) <Q>that which was <HI>spoken of the Lord</HI> by <HI>the prophet,</HI></Q> is cited by an evangelist, and declared <HI>to be fulfilled;</HI> the idea of "a <HI>mere accommodation</HI>" becomes highly improper, not only in a grammatical, but also in a religious sense.</P>
<P>Therefore, in answer to all that has been said in favour of <HI>accommodations,</HI> I must observe, that the <HI>fulfilling</HI> of proverbs and phrases, or of quotations from poets and historians, by <HI>a similarity of circum∣stances,</HI> is so widely different from <HI>the fulfilling of a prophecy,</HI> that the true meaning of the word <HI>fulfill,</HI> when applied to the latter, cannot justly be ascertained by such a comparison.</P>
<P>The word of <HI>a prophet</HI> (especially the word of the LORD by a PROPHET) implies a <HI>foretelling</HI> or pro∣mise of future things, which must in due time be <HI>fulfilled;</HI> as <Q>all things must <HI>be fulfilled</HI> (said our Lord) which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms concerning me.</Q> Luke xxiv. 44.</P>
<P>Therefore when we are told, that <HI>"the word which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet" is fulfilled,</HI> we
<PB N="8" REF="132"/>
cannot, either with grammatical, or religious pro∣priety (as I have before observed) understand any other <HI>fulfilling or accomplishment</HI> than that which was originally intended by the holy spirit to be pre∣figured.</P>
<P>Because we cannot allow, that a scripture prophecy is <HI>accommodated</HI> <Q>to a particular sense, to which it originally had no reference<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 40. Crit. Dissert.</NOTE>,</Q> unless we allow likewise that such <HI>an accommodation</HI> is absolutely a <HI>perversion</HI> of the <HI>primary</HI> sense of the prophet: for readers would not only be thereby perplexed and misled with respect to the true accomplishment ori∣ginally and singly intended by the words of the pro∣phet so cited, but would also be naturally led to con∣ceive, that the matters, related by the evangelist, were intentionally prefigured or foretold thereby, which would be a deception of no small discredit to the evangelist, if his comparison had really no other relation to the prophecy than that <Q><HI>of a</HI> similiarity of circumstances.</Q></P>
<P>So that such a misapplication of scripture pro∣phecy cannot otherwise be considered than as a de∣ception leading to a <HI>double misconstruction</HI> as above; which would be as little suitable to the testimony of an evangelist <HI>"by way of illustration,"</HI> as to the original sense of the prophet, whatever Dr. Benson
<PB N="9" REF="133"/>
may think of it, or Dr. W—ms either. See his Remarks, p. 40.</P>
<P>If all this be duly considered, I think no one can reasonably suppose that an evangelist would attempt to <HI>mislead</HI> his readers by declaring a prophecy to be accomplished <HI>or fulfilled</HI> in <Q>a particular sense to which it <HI>originally had no reference.</HI></Q> See Cri∣tical Dissert. p. 40.</P>
<P>Dr. Benson in page xxii. of his introduction in∣forms us, that <Q>if the iid and xvith Psalms can be shown quite throughout to agree to king David, then they ought to be interpreted of him. But if (as some judicious persons have thought) there be in them some expressions, which are not applicable to king David, then they should be interpreted wholly concerning the Messiah; to whom they do, in every part, very well agree.</Q></P>
<P>Now I am of the same opinion with Dr. Benson that these two Psalms are undoubtedly to be inter∣preted of the Messiah, and I do not at all contend for the application of them to David.</P>
<P>I only object, therefore, to the Doctor's rule of interpretation, which he has applied to the said Psalms; because I think it will be liable, in a great variety of applications, to mislead and perplex those persons, who may happen to adopt it.</P>
<P>For instance; the lxxiid Psalm, of which he speaks in the same page, is undoubtedly a prophecy of Christ's kingdom, as Dr. Benson interprets it; yet
<PB N="10" REF="134"/>
his rule seems to lead him into a real difficulty con∣cerning it; because he is thereby obliged to deny the least reference to king Solomon; when it plainly appears by the title of the Psalm (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>"To So∣lomon"</HI>) that the psalmist absolutely addressed himself <HI>to Solomon,</HI> who in the beginning of his reign was manifestly a type of the spiritual Solomon or Shiloh (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) the prince <HI>of "peace</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Isaiah ix.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Indeed the Doctor's rule can by no means be ad∣mitted, if we consider the nature and general style of prophetical writings, and the abrupt transitions fre∣quently found therein; of which I have given am∣ple and undeniable proofs from the viith, viiith, and ixth chapters of Isaiah. See the second part of my remarks on the Critical Dissertation.</P>
<P>These passages, and many others of the same kind, very much confirm what I have wrote (Part II. p. 23) concerning the passage quoted by St. Matthew from Hosea; (viz. <Q>out of Egypt have I called my son</Q>)
and, I think, must prove to all considerate people, that Dr. Sykes (the other cham∣pion for accommodations to whom Dr. W—ms has referred me) has been much too precipitate in decla∣ring (pages 230 and 231 of his Connexion of natural and revealed Religion) <Q>that the prophet (in this text) is not speaking of <HI>any future event:</HI></Q> and that the
<PB N="11" REF="135"/>
term <Q>fulfilled, cannot imply a prophecy of our Sa∣viour's going into Egypt, or coming from thence:</Q> &amp;c.—The same observation may with justice be made concerning Dr. W—ms, who boldly asks (page 40.)—"How can it be said, that any thing is ful∣filled "which was not spoken to be fulfilled? as in chap. ii. 15. (Matthew) <Q>or not spoken by a pro∣phet, in the sense in which it is cited by an evan∣gelist?</Q> Also the Doctor declares in page 39— concerning this passage, that it <Q>could not be ful∣filled <HI>when the</HI> child Jesus <HI>came out of</HI> Egypt.</Q></P>
<P>In answer to these assertions I must observe in the first place, that they cannot by any means be proved. And secondly, that it is most reasonable to believe this text of Hosea to be a prophecy of Christ; be∣cause the style and construction of the sentence itself is so peculiarly adapted to the <HI>single person</HI> of the Messiah, that the Seventy have thought themselves obliged to leave the <HI>literal sense</HI> of the original, in order to render it more suitable in their translation to <HI>the people</HI> of Israel: all which I have before parti∣cularly noted.</P>
<P>But there are still other reasons to be given in fa∣vour of it.</P>
<P>Though the people of Israel are here spoken of in such a manner, that Dr. W—ms thinks he has sufficient reason to intitle it <Q>a declaration of an event long past;</Q> yet St. Matthew expresly quotes it as a prophecy, viz. as <Q>that which was spoken of
<PB N="12" REF="136"/>
the Lord by the prophet;</Q> which expression could not with any propriety be used, if the words of the prophet were merely an <HI>historical relation;</HI> for they could not, in that case, be said to be <Q>spoken of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>Thus it plainly appears, that there is not the least room to suppose <HI>an accommodation.</HI></P>
<P>So that, notwithstanding all that has been said by Dr. Sykes, Dr. G. Benson, and Dr. W—ms, against double senses, it must unavoidably be allowed, that the <Q><HI>declaration (in this place)</HI> of an event long past,</Q> prefigured <HI>an event to come;</HI> and conse∣quently that <HI>this single text</HI> affords an indisputable proof of the subsistance of double senses in the Scrip∣tures.</P>
<P>Though some Christians have run into errors by turning every thing into allegory, double senses, pa∣rables and types, whether they were really so or not; yet this is no just argument why we should indiscrimi∣nately reject all constructions of this kind.</P>
<P>And though I contend for double senses in some cases, yet I am as averse to an unnecessary multipli∣cation of them as Dr. W—ms can be; and there∣fore reject and protest against the Doctor's proposi∣tion (in page of his MS reply to my remarks) that if a prophecy <Q>has two <HI>(senses)</HI> it may have two hundred; and all of them equally just.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>fulfilling of a prophecy</HI> (as I have before ob∣served) must mean the <HI>only true accomplishment, or
<PB N="13" REF="137"/>
completion of it;</HI> so that it cannot justly be extended, or applied to any further circumstances, than those particularly and originally intended; therefore, when an evangelist has declared a prophecy <HI>to be fulfilled,</HI> though he may have convinced us that the prophet's words referred to are capable of bearing <HI>a double sense</HI> (viz. one literal, and one allegorical or prefi∣gurative, which he himself points out) yet, at the same time, he manifestly excludes the other 198 senses, notwithstanding that Dr. W—ms thinks <HI>"all of them equally just."</HI> For after a declaration is made <HI>(of indisputable authority)</HI> that a prophecy <HI>is fulfilled,</HI> it would be, not only impertinent, but presumptuous, to look for <HI>a further accomplish∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>It is necessary, however, for me to observe, that the <HI>fulfilling of some particular prophecies</HI> includes a considerable length of time, as well as a variety of circumstances and places.</P>
<P>Of this, I propose to give one remarkable in∣stance, which will afford me, at the same time, a proper opportunity of speaking more particularly to Dr. Sykes.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in his Connexion of natural and re∣vealed Religion, chap. x. p. 229, affirms, <Q>that our Saviour, and his apostles, applied the term <HI>to ful∣fill,</HI> when there was only a similitude of circum∣stances: and (that) they cited the words of the Old Testament, and made use of that term, upon
<PB N="14" REF="138"/>
the application of them, where they did not de∣sign to express the <HI>accomplishment</HI> of a <HI>prophecy.</HI></Q> <Q>You have (says the Doctor) <HI>an instance very clear</HI> in Matthew xiii. 14, 15. where our Saviour gives the reason why he spoke to the people in parables: <HI>because,</HI> says he, <HI>they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they under∣stand.</HI> And in them is <HI>fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, by hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive. For this peoples heart is</HI> waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed: lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their hearts, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our Saviour (says the Doctor) applies these words to the Jews in Judea, and St. Paul, many years afterwards, applies the very same prophecy to the Jews at Rome.</Q> <Q>This shews (continues he) that, though the term <HI>fulfill,</HI> when applied to an <HI>event foretold, does</HI> signify the accomplishment of <HI>a real prophecy;</HI> yet it was used in cases where there was no accomplishment of a prediction, but only a <HI>similitude of circum∣stances;</HI> and consequently, the application of the words of a prophet to a certain particular event, by w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h they are said to <HI>be fulfilled,</HI> does not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a double sense of prophecy,
<PB N="15" REF="139"/>
or that such a <HI>particular event</HI> was foretold:</Q> <Q>But the real meaning of the word must be deter∣mined by other circumstances; such as, whether the prophet is speaking of a future event or not, or, in short, by those means by which one knows whether the words are prophetic or not.</Q></P>
<P>But before all this reasoning of Dr. Sykes be admitted, we ought carefully to examine the foun∣dation or proof on which it is built.</P>
<P>This he calls <HI>"an instance very clear;"</HI> but I hope to convince my readers, that it is <HI>no instance at all of this matter,</HI> and consequently that the Doc∣tor's conclusion thereupon is unjust.</P>
<P>Were not the Jews one people, and descended from the same stock, whether they lived at Jerusa∣lem or Rome?</P>
<P>If this be granted (and I think the most zealous advocates for Dr. Sykes will not deny it) it must ne∣cessarily be allowed likewise, that this remarkable prophecy of Esaias concerning them, (viz. <Q>by hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand,</Q> &amp;c. Isaiah vi. 10.) was <HI>manifestly fulfilled</HI> when the Jews rejected the doctrine of Christ, whether preached by himself at one time, or by his apostles at other different times.</P>
<P>So I think I may safely conclude that the two <HI>dif∣ferent applications</HI> quoted by Dr. Sykes of this same prophecy, were not occasioned, as he supposes, by a
<PB N="16" REF="140"/>
mere <HI>"similitude of circumstances,"</HI> but by a <HI>direct accomplishment</HI> of <HI>the prediction</HI> in <HI>both cases.</HI></P>
<P>Now as this example cannot any longer serve the cause in favour of which it was quoted by Dr. Sykes; I hope it will not be esteemed an im∣proper example of a very <HI>different argument,</HI> and therefore I shall beg leave to claim it on my side of the question, as <HI>"an instance very clear"</HI> of the truth of the observation which I made above, viz. that the <HI>fulfilling</HI> of some particular prophecies includes a considerable length of time, as well as a variety of circumstances and places.</P>
<P>However, I must not leave this text without coming to a further explanation with Dr. W—ms concerning it, because he has brought a very heavy accusation against me concerning the parallel account given by St. Mark, chap. iv. 11, 12.</P>
<P>He charges me with <HI>reflecting</HI> <Q>severely on the character of the blessed Jesus,</Q> by saying, <Q>that he taught in parables, lest they should understand and be saved.</Q> "Our Saviour" (says the Doctor) <Q>gave a very different reason for his conduct; and Mr. S— should have rendered the passage Mark iv. 12. agreeable to the evangelist's words in the 33d verse of the same chapter: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> should be there translated <HI>if per∣adventure,</HI> as it is in 2d. Timothy ii. 25.</Q> — However, I am not at all conscious (I thank God)
<PB N="17" REF="141"/>
of having in the least respect offended against the character of our blessed Lord.</P>
<P>Neither do I know of any <HI>severe reflection</HI> in this case, except the Doctor's <HI>own charge</HI> against myself.</P>
<P>Whatever sense the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> may bear in other places, yet in the parallel places of St. Matthew and Mark above-mentioned, it must necessarily be construed <HI>"lest"</HI>—or to that effect: for, as the sense of the context must confirm the true meaning of any particular word, it will be found, upon ex∣amination, that the Doctor's sense of these passages cannot possibly be admitted.</P>
<P>The words of Christ, according to the testimony of both these evangelists, point out the material distinction, which he then made between those that were true believers, and the reprobate Jews, whom our Lord called, "them that are without" (see Mark iv. 11.) to the former it was <Q>given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God,</Q> Matthew xiii. 11. Mark iv. 11. But to the latter, says St. Matthew, <HI>"it is not given."</HI></P>
<P>Now this necessary distinction is entirely lost by Dr. W—ms's interpretation, because there is no such distinction made in the 33d verse of the fourth chapter of St. Mark, the sense of which the Doctor proposes to adopt; for the evangelist is there speaking of Christ's preaching in general to the whole multitude, including those to whom <Q>it
<PB N="18" REF="142"/>
was given to know,</Q> as well as those to whom it was "not given;" and this is certain, because in the very next verse (the 34th) we read, that afterwards, <Q><HI>when they were alone,</HI> he expounded all things to his disciples.</Q></P>
<P>Now it might very well be said of Christ's preaching to the whole multitude of good and bad together, that <Q>with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they <HI>were able to hear it;</HI></Q> because Christ observed this same method, even when he taught his disciples alone; and at last de∣clared to them, soon before his passion, <Q>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye <HI>cannot bear them now.</HI></Q> John xvi. 12.</P>
<P>But when the <HI>reprobate</HI> Jews are spoken of <HI>separately and distinctly</HI> from those to <HI>whom it</HI> was <HI>"given to know,"</HI> it cannot be understood that the word was spoken <Q><HI>unto them as they</HI> were able to hear it.</Q></P>
<P>Because, it is apparent, that they <HI>were never able to hear it, or bear it</HI>—according to the true sense of these phrases; which imply such a comprehension of the doctrine, as may produce an assent or belief; otherwise the prophecy of Isaiah, which Christ then referred to, could not have been fulfilled. <Q>Be∣cause <HI>seeing, they see not</HI> (said our Lord) and hearing, <HI>they hear not,</HI> neither do <HI>they under∣stand.</HI></Q> (Which is very different from being spoken to, as Dr. W—ms would have it, <Q>as they
<PB N="19" REF="143"/>
<HI>were able to</HI> hear.</Q>) <Q>And in them (continued our Lord) is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, by hearing ye shall hear, and <HI>shall not understand,</HI> and seeing, ye shall see, and <HI>shall not perceive.</HI></Q> (Therefore it is plain that St. Mark's expression, chap. iv. 33. cannot be applied to these, when distinctly spoken of from the rest of the congregation.) "For this people's heart" (said Isaiah) <Q>is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes <HI>they have closed, lest</HI> at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them</Q> (said our Lord). The closing of their eyes was their own act and deed, <Q>their eyes <HI>THEY</HI> have closed, <HI>LEST</HI> they should see,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that there was no partiality <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>For <Q>the reason why these mysteries are no more plainly delivered unto them (the Jews) is for their foregoing obstinacy.</Q> See ASSEMBLY'S ANNOT. on the said text.</P>
<P>Dr. Hammond paraphrases the 15th verse to the same effect, viz. that <Q>this is a just judgment of God's upon them, for their obduration and obstinacy,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mons. Martin likewise explains this to the same purpose. <Q>Cest a dire que Dieu se cache a ceux qui l'ayant pu trouver ne se sont pas mis en etat de le chercher, &amp; qu'il livre a leurs prejuges &amp; a leur tenebres ceux qui ont ferme les yeux a la verité.</Q></P></NOTE> in their condem∣nation,
<PB N="20" REF="144"/>
they having rendered themselves unworthy of a clearer revelation by their unwillingness to be converted. They rejected such evidence as Christ was pleased to give them, which would have been amply sufficient, had they not <HI>not wilfully shut their eyes against it;</HI> for St. John says, chap. iii. 19. <Q>this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their works are evil.</Q></P>
<P>Therefore they were <HI>justly esteemed unworthy</HI> <Q>to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</Q> For, "whosoever hath" (said our Lord) <Q>to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever <HI>hath not,</HI> from him <HI>shall be taken away,</HI> even <HI>that he hath.</HI> THEREFORE, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, speak I to them in parables, because they seeing, see not,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, "THEREFORE," plainly refer to the foregoing sentence, viz. <Q><HI>but whosoever</HI> hath not — <HI>from him</HI> shall be taken away,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that the scope and tenor of the argument would be entirely destroyed if Dr. W—ms's sense of the parallel passage in St. Mark were to be admitted.— For Christ plainly intended to shew, that the unbe∣lieving Jews would lose even what little knowledge they had; so far would they be from understanding or receiving his parables. And the event plainly proved this; for they fell from bad to worse, untill
<PB N="21" REF="145"/>
the total destruction of Jerusalem, when <HI>the abo∣mination of desolation</HI> (spoken of by Daniel) was accomplished.</P>
<P>St. Mark does not, indeed, express the very words of the prophet Isaiah, nor mention the quotation made of them by Christ, but he plainly delivers the <HI>full sense of them,</HI> as they were really <HI>fulfilled</HI> in the unbelieving Jews, viz.</P>
<P>"Unto you" (said Christ to his disciples) <Q>it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but unto <HI>them that are without,</HI> all these things are done in parables: THAT seeing they may see, <HI>and not perceive,</HI> and hearing they may hear, and <HI>not understand,</HI> LEST at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</Q></P>
<P>The particle <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ("THAT") followed by verbs in the subjunctive mood (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.) cannot possibly be made sense of, if the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ("LEST") is translated,—<HI>"if peradventure";</HI> because the negative <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, "may <HI>not see,</HI> and <HI>may not understand</HI>") absolutely leads to a different sense from that proposed by Dr. W—ms.</P>
<P>So that it is most reasonable to conclude with Dr. Hammond, that these words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <Q>that seeing,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>note the obduration of the Isra∣elites, which fell on them from God's desertion; as a punishment of their not making use of the
<PB N="22" REF="146"/>
talents, which he had given them, and so this verse is answerable, and parallel to Matthew xiii. 15, or the end of that place in Isaiah recited, and set down at large in St. Matthew; but here —(and so also in Luke viii. 10. and John xii. 40.) <HI>epitomized and summed up, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, lest they should see,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, therefore, cannot in ei∣ther of these places be construed <HI>"if peradventure,"</HI> without destroying the propriety of our Lord's quota∣tion from Isaiah, delivered at length by St. Mat∣thew, and <HI>epitomized by St. Mark</HI> as above; for the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the original prophecy, is properly rendered <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the Syriac, and LEST in the English translations, and cannot possibly bear any other sense agreeable to the context; because the prophet plainly foretold, that the Jews would <HI>wilfully shut their eyes</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <Q>LEST they should see with their eyes.</Q></P>
<P>Now, men do not usually <HI>shut their eyes</HI> in order <HI>to see therewith,</HI> or (according to Dr. W—ms's interpretation of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>"if peradventure"</HI> they may see with their eyes; but rather, that they may <HI>not see,</HI> or, according to the propriety of the English translation of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <Q>LEST <HI>they should see</HI> with their eyes,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The closing of the eyes, in this place, is indeed a mere figurative expression for the insensibility and wicked obstinacy of the Jews; yet the same reason∣ing
<PB N="23" REF="147"/>
holds good, notwithstanding this consideration, and sufficiently proves, that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> must be construed <HI>negatively,</HI> and not, as Dr. W—ms proposes, "if <HI>peradventure.</HI>"</P>
<P>By this example we learn that some parables were not only difficult to those reprobate unbelievers, whom St. Mark calls <HI>"them that are without,"</HI> but also, even to the true disciples themselves; who, by misunderstanding the parable of the sower, and by desiring an explanation of it (see 10th verse) occasioned this remarkable answer of our Lord, the purport of which is recorded in the two texts con∣sidered above.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there were very many cases, wherein the teaching by parables and types was (not only the safest and most prudent, but also) the shortest and clearest method of conveying a true idea of the proposed doctrine, as being very suitable to the genius and customs of the Eastern nations in general, and of the Jews in particular; and also because the types and figures themselves would make a very deep impression on the memory, and by their well known characters clearly illustrate the allegorical meaning.</P>
<P>I propose now to reconsider the principal subject of my remarks, viz. the prophecy of Isaiah con∣cerning the birth of Immanuel.</P>
<P>Dr. W—ms has asserted (page 44.) <Q>that the evangelist only alludes to the passage in Isaiah,
<PB N="24" REF="148"/>
because it was <HI>remarkably suitable</HI> to the matter which he was relating.</Q></P>
<P>This occasioned my question to the Doctor, viz. <Q>If <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> does not signify a virgin, in what sense can the text be esteemed <HI>remarkably suitable</HI> to the miraculous conception <HI>of a virgin</HI> by the Holy Ghost? And in what manner could the <HI>accom∣modation of it</HI> to that singular event assist the sacred historian (as he supposes) <HI>by way of illustration?</HI></Q> See Part I. page 39.</P>
<P>I afterwards observe, that the Doctor <Q>has taken great pains to make the text <HI>remarkably unsuitable,</HI> by insinuating that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the YOUNG WOMAN (as he construes it) spoken of in the text, was so far from being a <HI>virgin,</HI> that she was <HI>with child,</HI> even at the time when she was pointed at (as he devises in p. 31.) by the prophet.</Q></P>
<P>To which the Doctor replies, <Q>had St. Matthew alluded to the birth of this child, it would have been <HI>very unsuitable.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now this concession is sufficient for my purpose, because the Doctor's insinuation, that the evangelist alluded only <HI>"to the name Immanuel,"</HI> and not to the other circumstances related by the prophet, must appear entirely groundless, when we consider the words of St. Matthew.</P>
<P>For though the evangelist interpreted the name <HI>Immanuel,</HI> yet this does not prove, that he referred
<PB N="25" REF="149"/>
merely to <HI>this name,</HI> but rather, that no other person but the Messiah himself could properly be intitled, <HI>"God with us;"</HI> and consequently that he esteemed the words of Isaiah to be really a prophecy, and such a one as could not be <HI>fulfilled,</HI> except in Christ alone, who was truly <HI>"God with us."</HI> But farther—The evangelist's manner of introducing the quotation very clearly shews, that <HI>this name</HI> was not the only thing he intended to allude to.</P>
<P>For he says— <Q>NOW ALL THIS WAS DONE— (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) that it might <HI>be fulfilled</HI> which was spoken <HI>of the Lord by the prophet,</HI> behold A VIRGIN <HI>shall be with child,</HI> and shall <HI>bring forth a son,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The words "ALL THIS WAS DONE" must refer to the relation before given, concerning the miraculous conception of <HI>the virgin Mary</HI> by the Holy Ghost, and therefore the prophecy of Isaiah, that A VIRGIN should <HI>conceive,</HI> and <HI>bear a son, was suitable,</HI> not in <HI>the name only</HI> (as Doctor W—ms has insinuated) <HI>but</HI> in <HI>the whole quotation.</HI></P>
<P>Another objection is made, <Q>that the birth of a child from a virgin is a fact of such a nature, as not to admit of proof.</Q> "It is a fact" (says the Doctor) <Q><HI>which in the</HI> very nature of it can∣not be a sign to <HI>any</HI> person <HI>but the mother.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Nevertheless the Scriptures inform us that <HI>this sign</HI> was clearly proved (i. e. the wonderful event that <HI>a
<PB N="26" REF="150"/>
virgin had conceived,</HI> was known with absolute cer∣tainty) even <HI>before</HI> the birth of the Messiah; and this, not merely by the testimony <HI>of the mother,</HI> but by other very sufficient authorities; which rendered the sign as apparent and indubitable, as any other sign that was ever given, even the most self-evi∣dent.</P>
<P>For after the angel Gabriel had revealed to the virgin Mary, that she (although a virgin) should "conceive and bring forth a son;" St. Luke i. 31.) the same thing was confirmed to her by her cousin Elizabeth in the hill country of Judea.</P>
<P>"Blessed is she that believed" (said Elizabeth filled with the Holy Ghost) <Q>for there shall be a per∣formance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</Q> Luke i. 45.</P>
<P>See the whole salutation, and the testimony of John the Baptist, though himself at that time only a babe in the womb; which clearly proves that the absolute knowledge of the fact was not confined to the <HI>virgin mother alone.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards an angel was sent from God to pre∣vent Joseph from putting away his espoused wife on account of her being with child; and the angel in∣formed him before the time, that she should <Q>bring forth a son;</Q> and, that he might the more effec∣tually convince him of his wife's purity and virtue, he assured him, saying, <Q>that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</Q> (Matt. i. 20.)</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="151"/>Therefore, though <Q>the birth of a child from a virgin</Q> is by Dr. W—ms esteemed <Q>a fact of such a nature as not to admit of proof;</Q> yet no∣thing is impossible with God, who was pleased to give these indubitable proofs of the long promised sign, even whilst the child Jesus was in the womb, which must entirely obviate the Doctor's objection, that <HI>"this cannot be a sign to any person but the mother."</HI></P>
<P>In the fulness of time the sign was manifested in the most extraordinary manner.</P>
<P>An angel, accompanied with a multitude of the heavenly host, proclaimed the wonderful birth to the shepherds in the field; and a star pointed out to the eastern strangers the place where the young child lay.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly this wonderful circumstance, that A VIRGIN HAD BROUGHT FORTH A SON, would, in a little time, be as well known to <HI>the house of David,</HI> as these miraculous manifestations and confirmations of the said supernatural birth; especially as the family of Joseph, the blessed virgin's husband, was <HI>the chief branch of that royal stock,</HI> lineally descended from Zorobabel, and so from the son of Jesse.</P>
<P>There is still another difficulty with Dr. W—ms. <Q>I cannot perceive (says he) <HI>what event</HI> the birth of Immanuel could be a sign of, unless it <HI>could be a sign of itself?</HI></Q></P>
<P>But is it really possible, that Dr. W—ms <Q>can∣not perceive,</Q> that the miraculous birth of the
<PB N="28" REF="152"/>
true Immanuel was a sign of something more than that event itself?</P>
<P>Was it not a sign to all those, who then waited for <HI>"the consolation and redemption of Israel,"</HI> (Luke ii. 25.) that the <HI>kingdom of God</HI> was <HI>nigh at hand?</HI> (Matthew xii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then <HI>the kingdom</HI> of <HI>God is come</HI> unto you."</NOTE> Luke x. 9.11. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"And say unto them, the kingdom of God <HI>is come</HI> nigh unto you.—Notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."</NOTE>.)</P>
<P>Was it not a sign to <HI>Joseph, and others of the house of David,</HI> that a child, so born, must be the long promised Messiah of the <HI>seed of David,</HI> to whom <HI>the kingdom was to be restored,</HI> and in whom (according to Isaiah's promise to his cotemporaries of <HI>the house of David</HI>) it was to be established for ever? See Isaiah ix. 6, 7. 2 Sam. vii. 16.</P>
<P>But, I find, it is in vain that I urge to Dr. W—ms the accomplishment of the several pro∣phecies concerning the establishment of the <Q>kingdom of David</Q> in Christ; for the Doctor still seems to persist in his former notion that Nathaniel <Q>la∣boured under a mistake</Q> in calling Christ <Q>king of Israel.</Q></P>
<P>He hopes to evade the point by alledging, that <Q>not only Nathaniel and the disciples, but the whole Jewish nation did actually labour under a
<PB N="29" REF="153"/>
great mistake about <HI>the nature</HI> of the Messiah's kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>Thus he would lead me to a very different ques∣tion; but I am aware, that though the disciples did, for some time, <HI>"labour under a mistake,"</HI> as the Doctor observes, concerning <Q>the nature of the Messiah's kingdom;</Q> yet there was <HI>not the least mistake,</HI> in those who truly believed, concerning the main point in question, viz. whether or not the Messiah <HI>was really a king?</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding that our Lord rejected all the temporal authority of a worldly king, and declared, that his kingdom was not of this world, he was nevertheless really a king, <HI>"king of Israel"</HI> (as Nathaniel called him) and king of Judah, or (which is the same thing) <HI>"king of the Jews;"</HI> for even Pilate himself seemed convinced of Christ's just right to the title of <HI>king,</HI> though, like a thorough-paced time server, he preferred his own temporal in∣terest to all other considerations, and delivered up THE KING OF KINGS (Rev. xvii. 14.) to be slain, know∣ing him to be A KING; for his answer to the chief priests, concerning the title intended to be affixed to the cross, plainly shews, that he was conscious of this.</P>
<P>Dr. W—ms charges me with having <Q>brought a vast number of texts to prove, not (my) assertion, that Jesus was ever called the king of Judah, but the truth of (his) assertion,</Q> &amp;c. concerning the
<PB N="30" REF="154"/>
mistake of Nathaniel. And he says, <Q>this will be evident to every one who consults the passages cited by me.</Q></P>
<P>But if the Doctor will please once more to con∣sult the passages himself, he will find, that several among them are prophecies which were absolutely fulfilled in our Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>Therefore, I hope, he will not venture to assert, that the prophets likewise <HI>"laboured under a mistake,"</HI> when they proclaimed these titles of the glorious Messiah; or that the disciples, and all other Chris∣tians even to this day still "labour <HI>under a mistake</HI>" in applying them to Christ, in whom alone they were, or could be fulfilled.</P>
<P><Q>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout O daughter of Jerusalem: behold THY KING <HI>cometh unto thee:</HI></Q> the prophet then proceeds to describe <HI>this coming of</HI> THE KING <HI>of Zion and Jerusalem,</HI> so as exactly to correspond with the evangelist's account (Luke xix. 37, 38.) of Christ's publick entry into Jerusalem, when <Q>the whole multitude of the dis∣ciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice, for all the <HI>mighty works</HI> that they had seen: saying, <HI>blessed be</HI> THE KING <HI>that cometh</HI> in the <HI>name of the Lord,</HI></Q> &amp;c. For he was certainly <HI>a king</HI> even when he rode upon the ass, which is proved by the continuation of Zechariah's prophecy (ix. 9.) whereby he points out the character and appearance of <HI>the king of Zion and Jerusalem</HI> mentioned in the
<PB N="31" REF="155"/>
beginning of the same verse; "he is just" (said the prophet) <Q>and having salvation, lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</Q></P>
<P>So the prophet Micah declared, that out of <HI>Beth∣lehem Ephratah</HI> should <Q>he come forth that is to be <HI>ruler in Israel,</HI> whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting.</Q> (chap. v. 2.)</P>
<P>The event proved the truth of the prophet's words, as well as of the evangelist's citation (Matt. ii. 5 and 6.) for the holy one that was born at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> was afterwards undoubtedly <HI>"ruler in Israel,"</HI> be∣fore the dissolution of that people from an united na∣tion: of which (besides the power of his teaching and his mighty works) his publick entry into Jeru∣salem, and the authority shewn by him in clearing the temple, are remarkable proofs.</P>
<P>That Christ was "a <HI>ruler in Israel</HI>" is implied in the preceding words of the same prophet (Micah v. 1.) <Q>they shall <HI>smite the judge of Israel</HI> with a rod upon the cheek.</Q> A <HI>ruler</HI> and a <HI>judge</HI> are syno∣nymous terms; and it is certain that Christ pro∣nounced <HI>judgment</HI> against <HI>Israel</HI> for their impeni∣tence and want of faith—condemning them (with respect to their <HI>temporal estate</HI>) to a horrid destruction and desolation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Matthew, chap. xxiv.</NOTE>: and as all this was most punctu∣ally fulfilled <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Josephus's account of the Jewish War.</NOTE> upon them, it is certain likewise, that
<PB N="32" REF="156"/>
the same <HI>"judge of Israel"</HI> whom they smote upon the cheek, will <HI>one day judge them,</HI> also, in their <HI>eter∣nal state,</HI> as well as all their unhappy descendants who persist in the same unbelief.</P>
<P>If these prophecies were really <HI>fulfilled</HI> in Jesus, they most certainly prove, that the Messiah was (as he ever will be) A KING, and consequently that his disciples were not mistaken in calling him so, how∣soever they might misunderstand the <HI>nature</HI> of his kingdom.</P>
<P>Therefore the Doctor's reply upon this point can∣not well be esteemed a proof of any thing more than of his own great unwillingness to acknowledge, that he himself (instead of Nathaniel) <HI>labours under a mistake.</HI></P>
<P>Another remarkable excuse, which the Doctor has offered in behalf of his hypothesis, deserves par∣ticular notice.</P>
<P>In answer to my remarks on Canticles vi. 8. (con∣cerning the particular distinction there made of vir∣gins from queens and concubines) the Doctor replies, that <Q><HI>Hebrew poetry is not so well understood</HI> as to enable (me) to determine that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Canticles vi. 8. is not used in stead of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>for the sake of metre.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This unexpected turn of thought may, perhaps, be esteemed ingenious, but it is far from satisfactory; for if criticks were allowed to substitute the sense of one word for another, whenever their arguments are
<PB N="33" REF="157"/>
reduced to that necessity, it would be but a vain task to dispute with them; and a confusion of lan∣guage, like that of the builders of Babel, must necessarily succeed their perversion of words.</P>
<P>In English poetry the Doctor may produce as many instances of such substitutions as he pleases, and he may rest assured, that I shall never think it worth my while to attempt a confutation of them.</P>
<P>But when such refined criticisms are applied to any part of Holy Scripture, I think, they ought not by any means to be admitted, unless the authors of them shall be able to prove, that it is more justifi∣able to adapt the Scriptures to our own private opi∣nions, than our opinions to the Scriptures.</P>
