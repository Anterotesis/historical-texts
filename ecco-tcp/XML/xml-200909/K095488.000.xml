<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT, EARL OF OXFORD AND EARL MORTIMER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SUCH were the notes thy once lov'd Poet sung,</L>
<L>'Till death untimely stop'd his tuneful tongue.</L>
<L>O just beheld, and lost! admir'd, and mourn'd!</L>
<L>With softest manners, gentlest arts, adorn'd!</L>
<L>Blest in each science, blest in ev'ry strain!</L>
<L>Dear to the Muse, to HARLEY dear—in vain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR him, thou oft hast bid the world attend,</L>
<L>Fond to forget the statesman in the friend;</L>
<L>For SWIFT and him, despis'd the farce of state,</L>
<L>The sober follies of the wise and great;</L>
<L>Dextrous, the craving, fawning crowd to quit,</L>
<L>And pleas'd to 'scape from flattery to wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ABSENT or dead, still let a friend be dear,</L>
<L>(A sigh the absent claims, the dead a tear)</L>
<L>Recall those nights that clos'd thy toilsome days,</L>
<L>Still hear thy PARNELL in his living lays:</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>Who careless, now, of int'rest, fame, or fate,</L>
<L>Perhaps forgets that OXFORD e'er was great;</L>
<L>Or deeming meanest what we greatest call,</L>
<L>Beholds thee glorious only in thy fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And sure if ought below the seats divine</L>
<L>Can touch immortals, 'tis a soul like thine:</L>
<L>A soul supreme, in each hard instance try'd,</L>
<L>Above all pain, all anger, and all pride,</L>
<L>The rage of pow'r, the blast of public breath,</L>
<L>The lust of lucre, and the dread of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN vain to desarts thy retreat is made;</L>
<L>The muse attends thee to the silent shade:</L>
<L>'Tis her's, the brave man's latest steps to trace,</L>
<L>Re-judge his acts, and dignify disgrace.</L>
<L>When int'rest calls off all her sneaking train,</L>
<L>When all th' oblig'd desert, and all the vain;</L>
<L>She waits, or to the scaffold, or the cell,</L>
<L>When the last ling'ring friend has bid farewel.</L>
<L>Ev'n now she shades thy evening walk with bays,</L>
<L>(No hireling she, no prostitute to praise)</L>
<L>Ev'n now, observant of the parting ray,</L>
<L>Eyes the calm sun-set of thy various day,</L>
<L>Thro' fortune's cloud one truly great can see,</L>
<L>Nor fears to tell, that MORTIMER is he.</L>

<HEAD>HESIOD: OR, THE RISE OF WOMAN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHAT antient times (those times we fancy wise)</L>
<L>Have left on long record of Woman's rise,</L>
<L>What morals teach it, and what fables hide,</L>
<L>What author wrote it, how that author dy'd,</L>
<L>All these I sing. In Greece they fram'd the tale</L>
<L>(In Greece, 'twas thought a Woman might be frail.)</L>
<L>Ye modern beauties! where the poet drew</L>
<L>His softest pencil, think he dreamt of you;</L>
<L>And warn'd by him, ye wanton pens, beware</L>
<L>How Heav'n's concern'd to vindicate the fair.</L>
<L>The case was Hesiod's; he the fable writ;</L>
<L>Some think with meaning, some with idle wit:</L>
<L>Perhaps 'tis either, as the ladies please;</L>
<L>I wave the contest, and commence the lays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In days of yore, (no matter where or when,</L>
<L>'Twas ere the low creation swarm'd with men)</L>
<L>That one Prometheus, sprung of heav'nly birth,</L>
<L>(Our author's song can witness) liv'd on earth.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>He carv'd the turf to mold a manly frame,</L>
<L>And stole from Jove his animating flame.</L>
<L>The sly contrivance o'er Olympus ran,</L>
<L>When thus the monarch of the stars began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh vers'd in arts! whose daring thoughts aspire</L>
<L>To kindle clay with never-dying fire!</L>
<L>Enjoy thy glory past, that gift was thine;</L>
<L>The next thy creature meets, be fairly mine:</L>
<L>And such a gift, a vengeance so design'd,</L>
<L>As suits the counsel of a God to find;</L>
<L>A pleasing bosom-cheat, a specious ill,</L>
<L>Which felt thy curse, yet covet still to feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said, and Vulcan strait the sire commands,</L>
<L>To temper mortar with etherial hands;</L>
<L>In such a shape to mold a rising fair,</L>
<L>As virgin-goddesses are proud to wear;</L>
<L>To make her eyes with diamond-water shine,</L>
<L>And form her organs for a voice divine.</L>
<L>'Twas thus the sire ordain'd; the pow'r obey'd;</L>
<L>And work'd, and wonder'd at the work he made;</L>
<L>The fairest, softest, sweetest frame beneath,</L>
<L>Now made to seem, now more than seem, to breathe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As Vulcan ends, the chearful Queen of Charms</L>
<L>Clasp'd the new-panting creature in her arms;</L>
<L>From that embrace a fine complexion spread,</L>
<L>Where mingled whiteness glow'd with softer red.</L>
<L>Then in a kiss she breath'd her various arts,</L>
<L>Of trifling prettily with wounded hearts;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>A mind for love, but still a changing mind;</L>
<L>The lisp affected, and the glance design'd;</L>
<L>The sweet confusing blush, the secret wink,</L>
<L>The gentle-swimming walk, the courteous sink,</L>
<L>The stare for strangeness fit, for scorn the frown,</L>
<L>For decent yielding looks declining down,</L>
<L>The practis'd languish, where well-feign'd desire</L>
<L>Wou'd own its melting in a mutual fire;</L>
<L>Gay smiles to comfort; April show'rs to move;</L>
<L>And all the nature, all the art, of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gold-scepter'd Juno next exalts the fair;</L>
<L>Her touch endows her with imperious air,</L>
<L>Self-valuing fancy, highly-crested pride,</L>
<L>Strong sov'reign will, and some desire to chide:</L>
<L>For which, an eloquence, that aims to vex,</L>
<L>With native tropes of anger, arms the sex.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Minerva (skilful goddess) train'd the maid</L>
<L>To twirl the spindle by the twisting thread,</L>
<L>To fix the loom, instruct the reeds to part,</L>
<L>Cross the long weft, and close the web with art,</L>
<L>An useful gift; but what profuse expence,</L>
<L>What world of fashions, took its rise from hence!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young Hermes next, a close-contriving god,</L>
<L>Her brows encircled with his serpent rod:</L>
<L>Then plots and fair excuses, fill'd her brain,</L>
<L>The views of breaking am'rous vows for gain,</L>
<L>The price of favours; the designing arts</L>
<L>That aim at riches in contempt of hearts;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>And for a comfort in the marriage life,</L>
<L>The little, pilf'ring temper of a wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full on the fair his beams Apollo flung,</L>
<L>And fond perswasion tip'd her easy tongue;</L>
<L>He gave her words, where oily flatt'ry lays</L>
<L>The pleasing colours of the art of praise;</L>
<L>And wit, to scandal exquisitely prone,</L>
<L>Which frets another's spleen to cure its own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those sacred virgins whom the bards revere,</L>
<L>Tun'd all her voice, and shed a sweetness there,</L>
<L>To make her sense with double charms abound,</L>
<L>Or make her lively nonsense please by sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To dress the maid, the decent Graces brought</L>
<L>A robe in all the dies of beauty wrought,</L>
<L>And plac'd their boxes o'er a rich brocade</L>
<L>Where pictur'd Loves on ev'ry cover play'd;</L>
<L>Then spread those implements that Vulcan's art</L>
<L>Had fram'd to merit Cytherea's heart;</L>
<L>The wire to curl, the close indented comb</L>
<L>To call the locks that lightly wander, home;</L>
<L>And chief, the mirrour, where the ravish'd maid</L>
<L>Beholds and loves her own reflected shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair Flora lent her stores, the purpled Hours</L>
<L>Confin'd her tresses with a wreath of flow'rs;</L>
<L>Within the wreath arose a radiant crown;</L>
<L>A veil pellucid hung depending down;</L>
<L>Back roll'd her azure veil with serpent fold,</L>
<L>The purfled border deck'd the floor with gold.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>Her robe (which closely by the girdle brac't</L>
<L>Reveal'd the beauties of a slender waste)</L>
<L>Flow'd to the feet; to copy Venus' air,</L>
<L>When Venus' statues have a robe to wear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The new-sprung creature finish'd thus for harms,</L>
<L>Adjusts her habit, practises her charms,</L>
<L>With blushes glows, or shines with lively smiles,</L>
<L>Confirms her will, or recollects her wiles:</L>
<L>Then conscious of her worth, with easy pace</L>
<L>Glides by the glass, and turning views her face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A finer flax than what they wrought before,</L>
<L>Thro' time's deep cave the Sister Fates explore,</L>
<L>Then fix the loom, their fingers nimbly weave,</L>
<L>And thus their toil prophetic songs deceive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Flow from the rock, my flax! and swiftly flow,</L>
<L>Pursue thy thread; the spindle runs below.</L>
<L>A creature fond and changing, fair and vain,</L>
<L>The creature Woman, rises now to reign.</L>
<L>New beauty blooms, a beauty form'd to fly;</L>
<L>New love begins, a love produc'd to dye;</L>
<L>New parts distress the troubled scenes of life,</L>
<L>The fondling mistress, and the ruling wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Men, born to labour, all with pains provide;</L>
<L>Women have time, to sacrifice to pride:</L>
<L>They want the care of man, their want they know,</L>
<L>And dress to please with heart-alluring show,</L>
<L>The show prevailing, for the sway contend,</L>
<L>And make a servant where they meet a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<L>Thus in a thousand wax-erected forts</L>
<L>A loitering race the painful bee supports,</L>
<L>From sun to sun, from bank to bank he flies,</L>
<L>With honey loads his bag, with wax his thighs,</L>
<L>Fly where he will, at home the race remain,</L>
<L>Prune the silk dress, and murm'ring eat the gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet here and there we grant a gentle bride,</L>
<L>Whose temper betters by the father's side;</L>
<L>Unlike the rest that double human care,</L>
<L>Fond to relieve, or resolute to share:</L>
<L>Happy the man whom thus his stars advance!</L>
<L>The curse is gen'ral, but the blessing chance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus sung the Sisters, while the gods admire</L>
<L>Their beauteous creature, made for man in ire;</L>
<L>The young Pandora she, whom all contend</L>
<L>To make too perfect not to gain her end:</L>
<L>Then bid the winds that fly to breathe the Spring,</L>
<L>Return to bear her on a gentle wing;</L>
<L>With wafting airs the winds obsequious blow,</L>
<L>And land the shining vengeance safe below,</L>
<L>A golden coffer in her hand she bore,</L>
<L>(The present treach'rous, but the bearer more)</L>
<L>'Twas fraught with pangs; for Jove ordain'd above,</L>
<L>That gold should aid, and pangs attend on love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her gay descent the man perceiv'd afar,</L>
<L>Wond'ring he run to catch the falling star;</L>
<L>But so surpriz'd, as none but he can tell,</L>
<L>Who lov'd so quickly, and who lov'd so well.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="13"/>O'er all his veins the wand'ring passion burns,</L>
<L>He calls her nymph, and ev'ry nymph by turns.</L>
<L>Her form to lovely Venus he prefers,</L>
<L>Or swears that Venus' must be such as hers.</L>
<L>She, proud to rule, yet strangely fram'd to teize,</L>
<L>Neglects his offers while her airs she plays,</L>
<L>Shoots scornful glances from the bended frown,</L>
<L>In brisk disorder trips it up and down,</L>
<L>Then hums a careless tune to lay the storm,</L>
<L>And sits, and blushes, smiles; and yields, in form.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Now take what Jove design'd (she softly cry'd)</L>
<L>"This box thy portion, and myself thy bride:"</L>
<L>Fir'd with the prospect of the double charms,</L>
<L>He snatch'd the box, and bride, with eager arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unhappy man! to whom so bright she shone:</L>
<L>The fatal gift, her tempting self, unknown!</L>
<L>The winds were silent, all the waves asleep,</L>
<L>And heav'n was trac'd upon the flatt'ring deep;</L>
<L>But whilst he looks unmindful of a storm,</L>
<L>And thinks the water wears a stable form,</L>
<L>What dreadful din around his ears shall rise!</L>
<L>What frowns confuse his picture of the skies!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At first the creature man was fram'd alone,</L>
<L>Lord of himself, and all the world his own.</L>
<L>For him the nymphs in green forsook the woods,</L>
<L>For him the nymphs in blue forsook the floods;</L>
<L>In vain the Satyrs rage, the Tritons rave,</L>
<L>They bore him heroes in the secret cave.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="14"/>No care destroy'd, no sick disorder prey'd,</L>
<L>No bending age his sprightly form decay'd,</L>
<L>No wars were known, no females heard to rage,</L>
<L>And Poets tell us, 'twas a golden age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Woman came, those ills the box confin'd</L>
<L>Burst furious out, and poison'd all the wind,</L>
<L>From point to point, from pole to pole they flew,</L>
<L>Spread as they went, and in the progress grew:</L>
<L>The nymphs regretting left the mortal race,</L>
<L>And alt'ring nature wore a sickly face;</L>
<L>New terms of folly rose, new states of care;</L>
<L>New plagues, to suffer, and to please, the fair!</L>
<L>The days of whining, and of wild intrigues,</L>
<L>Commenc'd, or finish'd, with the breach of leagues;</L>
<L>The mean designs of well-dissembled love;</L>
<L>The sordid matches never join'd above;</L>
<L>Abroad, the labour, and at home the noise,</L>
<L>(Man's double suff'rings for domestic joys)</L>
<L>The curse of jealousy; expence, and strife;</L>
<L>Divorce, the public brand of shameful life;</L>
<L>The rival's sword; the qualm that takes the fair;</L>
<L>Disdain for passion, passion in despair—</L>
<L>These, and a thousand, yet unnam'd, we find;</L>
<L>Ah fear the thousand, yet unnam'd behind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus on Parnassus tuneful Hesiod sung,</L>
<L>The mountain echo'd, and the valley rung,</L>
<L>The sacred groves a fix'd attention show,</L>
<L>The chrystal Helicon forbore to flow,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="15"/>The sky grew bright, and (if his verse be true)</L>
<L>The Muses came to give the laurel too.</L>
<L>But what avail'd the verdant prize of wit,</L>
<L>If Love swore vengeance for the tales he writ?</L>
<L>Ye fair offended, hear your friend relate</L>
<L>What heavy judgment prov'd the writer's fate,</L>
<L>Tho' when it happen'd, no relation clears,</L>
<L>'Tis thought in five, or five and twenty years.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where, dark and silent, with a twisted shade</L>
<L>The neighb'ring woods a native arbour made,</L>
<L>There oft a tender pair for am'rous play</L>
<L>Retiring, toy'd the ravish'd hours away;</L>
<L>A Locrian youth, the gentle Troilus he,</L>
<L>A fair Milesian, kind Evanthe she:</L>
<L>But swelling nature in a fatal hour</L>
<L>Betray'd the secrets of the conscious bow'r;</L>
<L>The dire disgrace her brothers count their own,</L>
<L>And track her steps, to make its author known.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It chanc'd one evening, ('twas the lover's day)</L>
<L>Conceal'd in brakes the jealous kindred lay;</L>
<L>When Hesiod wand'ring, mus'd along the plain,</L>
<L>And fix'd his seat where love had fix'd the scene;</L>
<L>A strong suspicion strait possest their mind,</L>
<L>(For poets ever were a gentle kind.)</L>
<L>But when Evanthe near the passage stood,</L>
<L>Flung back a doubtful look, and shot the wood,</L>
<L>"Now take (at once they cry) thy due reward,"</L>
<L>And urg'd with erring rage, assault the bard.</L>

<L>WHEN thy beauty appears,</L>

<L>WHEN Spring came on with fresh delight,</L>

<L>'Twas then, in yonder piny grove,</L>

<L>Love pair'd the birds through all the grove,</L>

<L>Edwin (if right I read my song)</L>
<L>With slighted passion pac'd along</L>
<L>All in the moony light:</L>

<L>Pride of his sire, and glory of his house,</L>
<L>And more a Mars in combat than a Mouse:</L>

<HEAD>THE FLIES; AN ECLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN in the river cows for coolness stand,</L>
<L>And sheep for breezes seek the lofty land,</L>
<L>A youth, whom Aesop taught that ev'ry tree,</L>
<L>Each bird and insect spoke as well as he:</L>
<L>Walk'd calmly musing in a shaded way,</L>
<L>Where flow'ring hawthorn broke the sunny ray,</L>
<L>And thus instructs his moral pen to draw</L>
<L>A scene that obvious in the field he saw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Near a low ditch, where shallow waters meet,</L>
<L>Which never learnt to glide with liquid feet,</L>
<L>Whose Naiads never prattle as they play,</L>
<L>But screen'd with hedges slumber out the day,</L>
<L>There stands a slender fern's aspiring shade,</L>
<L>Whose answ'ring branches regularly lay'd</L>
<L>Put forth their answ'ring boughs, and proudly rise</L>
<L>Three stories upward, in the nether skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For shelter here, to shun the noon-day heat,</L>
<L>An airy nation of the Flies retreat;</L>
<L>Some in soft air their silken pinions ply,</L>
<L>And some from bough to bough delighted sly,</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="78"/>Some rise, and circling light to perch again;</L>
<L>A pleasing murmur hums along the plain.</L>
<L>So, when a stage invites to pageant shows,</L>
<L>(If great and small are like) appear the Beaux;</L>
<L>In boxes some with spruce pretension sit,</L>
<L>Some change from seat to seat within the pit,</L>
<L>Some roam the scenes, or turning cease to roam;</L>
<L>Preluding music fills the lofty dome.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When thus a fly (if what a fly can say</L>
<L>Deserves attention) rais'd the rural lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where late Amintor made a nymph a bride,</L>
<L>Joyful I flew by young Favonia's side,</L>
<L>Who, mindless of the feasting, went to sip</L>
<L>The balmy pleasure of the shepherd's lip.</L>
<L>I saw the wanton, where I stoop'd to sup,</L>
<L>And half resolv'd to drown me in the cup;</L>
<L>'Till brush'd by careless hands, she soar'd above:</L>
<L>Cease, beauty, cease to vex a tender love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus ends the youth, the buzzing meadow rung,</L>
<L>And thus the rival of his music sung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When suns by thousands shone in orbs of dew,</L>
<L>I wafted soft with Zephyretta flew;</L>
<L>Saw the clean pail, and sought the milky chear,</L>
<L>While little Daphne seiz'd my roving dear.</L>
<L>Wretch that I was! I might have warn'd the dame,</L>
<L>Yet sat indulging as the danger came,</L>
<L>But the kind huntress left her free to soar:</L>
<L>Ah! guard, ye Lovers, guard a mistress more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="74" REF="79"/>
<L>Thus from the fern, whose high-projecting arms,</L>
<L>The sleeting nation bent with dusky swarms,</L>
<L>The Swains their love in easy music breathe,</L>
<L>When tongues and tumult stun the field beneath.</L>
<L>Black Ants in teams come darkning all the road,</L>
<L>Some call to march, and some to lift the load;</L>
<L>They strain, they labour with incessant pains,</L>
<L>Press'd by the cumbrous weight of single grains.</L>
<L>The Flies struck silent gaze with wonder down:</L>
<L>The busy Burghers reach their earthy town;</L>
<L>Where lay the burthens of a wint'ry store,</L>
<L>And thence unwearied part in search of more.</L>
<L>Yet one grave Sage a moment's space attends,</L>
<L>And the small city's loftiest point ascends,</L>
<L>Wipes the salt dew that trickles down his face,</L>
<L>And thus harangues them with the gravest grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye foolish Nurslings of the Summer air,</L>
<L>These gentle tunes and whining songs forbear;</L>
<L>Your trees and whisp'ring breeze, your Grove and Love,</L>
<L>Your Cupid's quiver, and his mother's dove:</L>
<L>Let bards to business bend their vig'rous wing,</L>
<L>And sing but seldom, if they love to sing:</L>
<L>Else, when the flourets of the season fail,</L>
<L>And thus your fenny shade forsakes the vale,</L>
<L>Tho' one would save ye, not one grain of wheat</L>
<L>Shou'd pay such songsters idling at my gate.</L>

<L>She runs her female exercises o'er,</L>
<L>Unfurls or closes, raps or turns the fan,</L>
<L>And smiles, or blushes at the creature Man.</L>
<L>With quicker life, as gilded coaches pass,</L>
<L>In sideling courtesy the drops the glass.</L>
<L>With better strength, on visit-days, she bears</L>
<L>To mount her fifty flights of ample stairs.</L>
<L>Her mien, her shape, her temper, eyes and tongue</L>
<L>Are sure to conquer,—for the rogue is young;</L>
<L>And all that's madly wild, or oddly gay,</L>
<L>We call it only pretty Fanny's way.</L>
<L>Let time, that makes you homely, make you sage;</L>
<L>The sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age.</L>
<L>'Tis true, when beauty dawns with early fire,</L>
<L>And hears the flatt'ring tongues of soft desire,</L>
<L>If not from virtue, from its gravest ways</L>
<L>The soul with pleasing avocation strays.</L>
<L>But beauty gone, 'tis easier to be wise;</L>
<L>As harpers better, by the loss of eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Henceforth retire, reduce your roving airs,</L>
<L>Haunt less the plays, and more the public pray'rs,</L>
<L>Reject the Mechlin head, and gold brocade,</L>
<L>Go pray, in sober Norwich crape array'd.</L>

<L>So for the rest, with less incumbrance hung,</L>
<L>You walk thro life, unmingled with the young;</L>
<L>And view the shade and Substance as you pass</L>
<L>With joint endeavour trifling at the glass,</L>

<L>'Twas thus (if man with woman we compare)</L>
<L>The wise Athenian crost a glittering fair,</L>
<L>Unmov'd by tongues and sights, he walk'd the place,</L>
<L>Thro' tape, toys, tinsel, gimp, perfume, and lace;</L>
<L>Then bends from Mars's hill his awful eyes,</L>
<L>And What a world I never want? he cries;</L>
<L>But cries unheard: for Folly will be free.</L>

<HEAD>THE HERMIT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAR in a wild, unknown to public view,</L>
<L>From youth to age a rev'rend Hermit grew;</L>
<L>The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,</L>
<L>His food the fruits, his drink the chrystal well:</L>
<L>Remote from man, with God he pass'd the days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all his bus'ness, all his pleasure praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A life so sacred, such serene repose,</L>
<L>Seem'd heav'n itself, 'till one suggestion rose;</L>
<L>That Vice shou'd triumph, Virtue Vice obey,</L>
<L>This sprung some doubt of Providence's sway:</L>
<L>His hopes no more a certain prospect boast,</L>
<L>And all the tenour of his soul is lost:</L>
<L>So when a smooth expanse receives imprest</L>
<L>Calm Nature's image on its wat'ry breast,</L>
<L>Down bend the banks, the trees depending grow,</L>
<L>And skies beneath with answ'ring colours glow:</L>
<L><PB N="97" REF="102"/>But if a stone the gentle sea divide,</L>
<L>Swift ruffling circles curl on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>And glimmering fragments of a broken sun,</L>
<L>Banks, trees, and skies, in thick disorder run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To clear this doubt, to know the world by sight,</L>
<L>To find if books, or swains, report it right;</L>
<L>(For yet by swains alone the world he knew,</L>
<L>Whose feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew)</L>
<L>He quits his cell; the pilgrim-staff he bore,</L>
<L>And fix'd the scallop in his hat before;</L>
<L>Then with the sun a rising journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each event.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morn was wasted in the pathless grass,</L>
<L>And long and lonesome was the wild to pass;</L>
<L>But when the Southern sun had warm'd the day,</L>
<L>A youth came posting o'er a crossing way;</L>
<L>His rayment decent, his complexion fair,</L>
<L>And soft in graceful ringlets wav'd his hair.</L>
<L>Then near approaching, Father, Hail! he cry'd;</L>
<L>And Hail, my Son, the reverend Sire reply'd;</L>
<L>Words follow'd words, from question answer flow'd,</L>
<L>And talk of various kind deceiv'd the road;</L>
<L>'Till each with other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their age they differ, join in heart:</L>
<L>Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound,</L>

<L>Came onward, mantled o'er with sober gray;</L>

<L>When near the road a stately palace rose:</L>
<L>There by the moon thro' ranks of trees they pass,</L>
<L>Whose verdure crown'd their sloping sides of grass.</L>
<L>It chanc'd the noble master of the dome</L>
<L>Still made his house the wand'ring stranger's home:</L>
<L>Yet still the kindness, from a thirst of praise,</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain flourish of expensive ease.</L>
<L>The pair arrive: the liv'ry'd servants wait;</L>
<L>Their lord receives them at the pompous gate.</L>
<L>The table groans with costly piles of food,</L>
<L>And all is more than hospitably good.</L>

<L>Deep sunk in sleep, and silk, and heaps of down.</L>

<L>At length 'tis morn, and at the dawn of day</L>
<L>Along the wide canals the Zephyrs play;</L>
<L>Fresh o'er the gay parterres the breezes creep,</L>
<L>And shake the neighb'ring wood to banish sleep.</L>
<L>Up rise the guests, obedient to the call:</L>
<L>An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall;</L>
<L>Rich luscious wine a golden goblet grac'd,</L>
<L>Which the kind master forc'd the guests to taste.</L>
<L>Then pleas'd and thankful, from the porch they go;</L>

<L>And o'er their heads loud-rolling thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,</L>

<L>At length some pity warm'd the master's breast,</L>
<L>('Twas then, his threshold first receiv'd a guest)</L>
<L>Slow creaking turns the door with jealous care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the shivering pair;</L>
<L><PB N="100" REF="105"/>One frugal faggot lights the naked walls,</L>
<L>And Nature's fervor thro' their limbs recals:</L>
<L>Bread of the coarsest sort, with eager wine,</L>

<L>And when the tempest first appear'd to cease,</L>
<L>A ready warning bid them part in peace.</L>

<L>And why shou'd such, (within himself he cry'd)</L>
<L>Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside?</L>

<L>In ev'ry settling feature of his face!</L>
<L>When from his vest the young companion bore</L>
<L>That Cup, the gen'rous landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid profusely with the precious bowl</L>
<L>The stinted kindness of this churlish soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now the clouds in airy tumult fly,</L>
<L>The sun emerging opes an azure sky;</L>
<L>A fresher green the smelling leaves display,</L>
<L>And glitt'ring as they tremble, cheer the day:</L>
<L>The weather courts them from the poor retreat,</L>
<L>And the glad master bolts the wary gate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While hence they walk, the Pilgrim's bosom wrought</L>
<L>With all the travel of uncertain thought;</L>
<L>His partner's acts without their cause appear,</L>
<L>'Twas there a vice, and seem'd a madness here:</L>

<L>Now night's dim shades again involve the sky;</L>
<L>Again the wand'rers want a place to lye,</L>

<L>Hither the walkers turn with weary feet,</L>

<L>To him who gives us all, I yield a part;</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR defects and follies are too often unknown to us; nay, they are so far from being known to us, that they pass for demonstrations of our worth. This makes us easy in the midst of them, fond to shew them, fond to improve in them, and to be esteemed for them. Then it is that a thousand unaccountable con∣ceits, gay inventions, and extravagant actions must af∣ford us pleasures, and display as to others in the colours which we ourselves take a fancy to glory in: and in∣deed there is something so amusing for the time in this state of vanity and ill-grounded satisfaction, that even the wiser world has chosen an exalted word to describe its enchantments, and called it THE PARADISE OF FOOLS. Perhaps the latter part of this reflection may seem a false thought to some, and bear another turn
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>than what I have given; but it is at present none of my business to look after it, who am going to confess that I have been lately amongst them in a vision.</P>
<P>Methought I was transported to a hill, green, flowery, and of an easy ascent. Upon the broad top of it resided squint-eyed ERROR, and popular OPINION with many heads; two that dealt in sorcery, and were famous for bewitching people with the love of themselves. To these repaired a multitude from every side, by two dif∣ferent paths which lead towards each of them. Some who had the most assuming air went directly of them∣selves to ERROR, without expecting a conductor; o∣thers of a softer nature went first to popular OPINION, from whence as she influenced and engaged them with their own praises, she delivered them over to his go∣vernment.</P>
<P>When we had ascended to an open part of the sum∣mit where OPINION abode, we found her entertaining several who had arrived before us. Her voice was plea∣sing; she breathed odours as she spoke: she seemed to have a tongue for every one; every one thought he heard of something that was valuable in himself, and expected a paradise which she promised as the reward of his merit. Thus we were drawn to follow her, 'till she should bring us where it was to be bestowed: and it was observable, that all the way we went, the com∣pany was either praising themselves in their qualifica∣tions, or one another for those qualifications which they
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>took to be conspicuous in their own characters, or dis∣praising others for wanting theirs, or vying in the de∣grees of them.</P>
<P>At last we approached a bower, at the entrance of which ERROR was seated. The trees were thick wo∣ven, and the place where he sat artfully contrived to darken him a little. He was disguised in a whitish robe, which he had put on, that he might appear to us with a nearer resemblance to TRUTH: and as she has a light whereby she manifests the beauties of nature to the eyes of her adorers, so he had provided himself with a magi∣cal wand, that he might do something in imitation of it, and please with delusions. This he listed solemnly, and muttering to himself, bid the glories which he kept un∣der enchantment to appear before us. Immediately we cast our eyes on that part of the sky to which he pointed, and observed a thin blue prospect, which cleared as mountains in a Summer morning when the mists go off, and the palace of VANITY appeared to sight.</P>
<P>The foundation hardly seemed a foundation, but a set of curling clouds, which it stood upon by magical contrivance. The way by which we ascended was paint∣ed like a rainbow; and as we went the breeze that play∣ed about us bewitched the senses. The walls were gild∣ed all for show; the lowest set of pillars were of the slight fine Corinthian order, and the top of the build∣ing being rounded, bore so far the resemblance of a bubble.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="115"/>At the gate the travellers neither met with a porter, nor waited 'till one should appear; every one thought his merits a sufficient passport, and pressed forward. In the hall we met with several phantoms, that rov'd a∣mongst us, and rang'd the company according to their sentiments. There was decreasing HONOUR, that had nothing to shew in but an old coat of his ancestor's at∣chievements: there was OSTENTATION, that made himself his own constant subject, and GALLANTRY strutting upon his tip-toes. At the upper end of the hall stood a throne, whose canopy glitter'd with all the riches that gayety could contrive to lavish on it; and between the gilded arms sat VANITY deck'd in the Pea∣cock's feathers, and acknowledged for another Venus by her votaries. The boy who stood beside her for a Cupid, and who made the world to bow before her, was called SELF-CONCEIT. His eyes had every now and then a cast inwards, to the neglect of all objects about him; and the arms which he made use of for conquest, were borrowed from those against whom he had a de∣sign. The arrow which he shot at the soldier, was fledg'd from his own plume of feathers; the dart he di∣rected against the man of wit, was winged from the quills he writ with; and that which he sent against those who presumed upon their riches, was headed with gold out of their treasuries: he made nets for statesmen from their own contrivances; he took fire from the eyes of ladies, with which he melted their
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>hearts; and lightning from the tongues of the eloquent, to enflame them with their own glories. At the foot of the throne sat three false Graces. FLATTERY with a shell of paint, AFFECTATION with a mirrour to prac∣tise at, and FASHION ever changing the posture of her cloaths. These applied themselves to secure the con∣quests which SELF-CONCEIT had gotten, and had each of them their particular polities. FLATTERY gave new colours and complexions to all things; AFFECTATION new airs and appearances, which, as she said, were not vulgar; and FASHION both concealed some home de∣fects, and added some foreign external beauties.</P>
<P>As I was reflecting upon what I saw, I heard a voice in the crowd, bemoaning the condition of man∣kind, which is thus managed by the breath of OPINION, deluded by ERROR, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir'd by SELF-CONCEIT, and given up to be trained in all the courses of VANITY, 'till SCORN or POVERTY come upon us. These expressions were no sooner handed about, but I immediately saw a general disorder, till at last there was a parting in one place, and a grave old man, decent and resolute, was led forward to be punished for the words he had uttered. He appeared inclined to have spoken in his own defence, but I could not observe that any one was willing to hear him. VANITY cast a scornful smile athim; SELF-CONCEIT was angry; FLATTERY, who knew him for PLAIN-DEALING, put on a vizard, and turned away; AFFECTATION tossed her fan, made mouths, and cal∣led
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>him ENVY or SLANDER; and FASHION would have it, that at least he must be ILL-MANNERS. Thus slight∣ed and despised by all, he was driven out for abusing people of merit and figure; and I heard it firmly resolv∣ed, that he should be used no better where-ever they met with him hereafter.</P>
<P>I had already seen the meaning of most part of that warning which he had given, and was considering how the latter words should be fulfilled, when a mighty noise was heard without, and the door was blackned by a numerous train of harpies crowding in upon us. FOLLY and BROKEN CREDIT were seen in the house before they entered. TROUBLE, SHAME, INFAMY, SCORN and POVERTY brought up the rear. VANITY, with her Cupid and Graces, disappeared; her subjects ran into holes and corners; but many of them were found and carried off (as I was told by one who stood near me) either to prisons or cellars, solitude, or little company, the mean arts or the viler crafts of life. But these, added he with a disdainful air, are such who would fondly live here, when their merits neither matched the lustre of the place, nor their riches its expences. We have seen such scenes as these before now; the glory you saw will all return when the hurry is over. I thank'd him for his information, and be∣lieving him so incorrigible as that he would stay till it was his turn to be taken, I made off to the door, and overtook some few, who, though they would not hear∣ken
<PB N="115" REF="118"/>to PLAIN-DEALING, were now terrified to good purpose by the example of others: but when they had touched the threshold, it was a strange shock to them to find that the delusion of ERROR was gone, and they plainly discerned the building to hang a little up in the air without any real foundation. At first we saw no∣thing but a desperate leap remained for us, and I a thou∣sand times blamed my unmeaning curiosity that had brought me into so much danger. But as they began to sink lower in their own minds, methought the pa∣lace sunk along with us; till they were arrived at the due point of ESTEEM which they ought to have for themselves; then the part of the building in which they stood touched the earth, and we departing out, it re∣tired from our eyes. Now, whether they who stayed in the palace were sensible of this descent, I cannot tell; it was then my opinion that they were not. However it be, my dream broke up at it, and has given me oc∣casion all my life to reflect upon the fatal consequences of following the suggestions of VANITY.</P>

<HEAD>VISION II. SPECTATOR. N<SUP>o</SUP> 501.</HEAD>
<P>HOW are we tortured with the absence of what we covet to possess, when it appears to be lost to us! what excursions does the soul make in imagina∣tion after it! and how does it turn into itself again, more foolishly fond and dejected, at the disappoint∣ment! our grief, instead of having recourse to reason, which might restrain it, searches to find a further nou∣rishment. It calls upon memory to relate the several passages and circumstances of satisfactions which we formerly enjoyed; the pleasures we purchased by those riches that are taken from us; or the power and splen∣dour of our departed honours; or the voice, the words, the looks, the temper, and affections of our friends that are deceased. It needs must happen from hence, that the passion should often swell to such a size as to burst the heart which contains it, if time did not make these circumstances less strong and lively, so that reason should become a more equal match for the passion, or
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>if another desire which becomes more present did not overpower them with a livelier representation. These are thoughts which I had, when I fell into a kind of vision upon this subject, and may therefore stand for a proper introduction to a relation of it.</P>
<P>I found myself upon a naked shore, with company whose afflicted countenances witnessed their conditions. Before us flowed a water deep, silent, and called the ri∣ver of TEARS, which issuing from two fountains on an upper ground, encompassed an island that lay before us. The boat which plied in it was old and shatter'd, having been sometimes overset by the impatience and haste of single passengers to arrive at the other side. This immediately was brought to us by MISFORTUNE who steers it, and we were all preparing to take our places, when there appeared a woman of a mild and composed behaviour, who began to deter us from it, by representing the dangers which would attend our voyage. Hereupon some who knew her for PATIENCE, and some of those too who 'till then cry'd the loudest, were persuaded by her, and return'd back. The rest of us went in, and she (whose good-nature would not suffer her to forsake persons in trouble) desired leave to ac∣company us, that she might at least administer some small comfort or advice while we sailed. We were no sooner embarked but the boat was pushed off, the sheet was spread; and being filled with sighs, which are the winds of that country, we made a passage to the far∣ther
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>bank thro' several difficulties of which t of us seem'd utterly regardless.</P>
<P>When we landed, we perceived the island to be strangely over-cast with fogs, which no brightness could pierce, so that a kind of gloomy horror sat al∣ways brooding over it. This had something in it very shocking to easy tempers, insomuch that some others, whom PATIENCE had by this time gain'd over, left us here, and privily convey'd themselves round the verge of the island to find a ford by which she told them they might escape.</P>
<P>For my part, I still went along with those who were for piercing into the centre of the place; and joining ourselves to others whom we found upon the same journey, we marched solemnly as at a funeral, thro' bordering hedges of rosemary, and thro' a grove of yew-trees, which love to over-shadow tombs and flou∣rish in church-yards. Here we heard on every side the wailings and complaints of several of the inhabitants, who had cast themselves disconsolately at the feet of trees; and as we chanc'd to approach any of these, we might perceive them wringing their hands, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, or after some other manner visibly agitated with vexation. Our sorrows were heigh∣tened by the influence of what we heard and saw, and one of our number was wrought up to such a pitch of wildness, as to talk of hanging himself upon a bough which shot temptingly a-cross the path we travelled in;
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>but he was restrain'd from it by the kind endeavours of our above-mentioned companion.</P>
<P>We had now gotten into the most dusky silent part of the island, and by the redoubled sounds of sighs, which made a doleful whistling in the branches, the thickness of air which occasioned faintish respiration, and the violent throbbings of heart which more and more affected us, we found that we approach'd the GROTTO OF GRIEF. It was a wide, hollow, and me∣lancholy cave, sunk deep in a dale, and watered by ri∣vulets that had a colour between red and black. These crept slow, and half congealed amongst its windings, and mixed their heavy murmur with the echo of groans that rolled thro' all the passages. In the most retired part of it sat the DOLEFUL BEING herself; the path to her was strewed with goads, stings, and thorns; and the throne on which she sat was broken into a rock with ragged pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon. A heavy mist hung above her, her head oppressed with it reclined upon her arm: thus did she reign over her disconsolate subjects, full of herself to stupidity, in e∣ternal pensiveness, and the profoundest silence. On one side of her stood DEJECTION just dropping into a swoon, and PALENESS wasting to a skeleton; on the other side were CARE inwardly tormented with imagi∣nations, and ANGUISH suffering outward TROUBLES to suck the blood from her heart in the shape of VUL∣TURES. The whole vault had a genuine dismalness in
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>it, which a few scattered lamps, whose blueish flames arose and sunk in their urns, discovered to our eyes with encrease. Some of us fell down, overcome and spent with what they suffer'd in the way, and were gi∣ven over to those tormenters that stood on either hand of the presence; others, galled and mortified with pain, recover'd the entrance, where PATIENCE, whom we had left behind, was still waiting to receive us.</P>
<P>With her (whose company was now become more grateful to us by the want we had found of her) we winded round the grotto, and ascended at the back of it, out of the mournful dale in whose bottom it lay. On this eminence we halted, by her advice, to pant for breath; and listing our eyes, which till then were fixed downwards, felt a sullen sort of satisfaction, in observing thro' the shades what numbers had entered the island. This satisfaction, which appears to have ill-nature in it, was excusable, because it happened at a time when we were too much taken up with our own concern, to have respect to that of others; and there∣fore we did not consider them as suffering, but our∣selves as not suffering in the most forlorn estate. It had also the groundwork of humanity and compassion in it, though the mind was then too deeply engaged to perceive it; but as we proceeded onwards it began to discover itself, and from observing that others were un∣happy, we came to question one another, when it was that we met, and what were the sad occasions that
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>brought us together. Then we heard our stories, we compared them, we mutually gave and received pity, and so by degrees became tolerable company.</P>
<P>A considerable part of the troublesome road was thus deceived; at length the openings among the trees grew larger, the air seemed thinner, it lay with less oppres∣sion upon us, and we could now and then discern tracts in it of a lighter greyness, like the breakings of day, short in duration, much enlivening, and called in that country GLEAMS OF AMUSEMENT. Within a short while these gleams began to appear more frequent, and then brighter and of a longer continuance; the SIGHS that hitherto filled the air with so much dolefulness, al∣tered to the sound of common breezes, and in general the horrors of the island were abated.</P>
<P>When we had arrived at last at the ford by which we were to pass out, we met with those fashionable mourners who had been ferried over along with us, and who being unwilling to go as far as we, had coast∣ed by the shore, to find the place, where they waited our coming; that by shewing themselves to the world only at that time when we did, they might seem also to have been among the troubles of the grotto. Here the waters, that rolled on the other side so deep and si∣lent, were much dried up, and it was an easter matter for us to wade over.</P>
<P>The river being crossed, we were received upon the further bank by our friends and acquaintance, whom
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>COMFORT had brought out to congratulate our appear∣ance in the world again. Some of these blamed us for staying so long away from them, others advised us a∣gainst all temptations of going back again; every one was cautious not to renew our trouble, by asking any particulars of the journey; and all concluded, that in a case of so much affliction, we could not have made choice of a fitter companion than PATIENCE. Here PATIENCE, appearing serene at her praises, delivered us over to COMFORT. COMFORT smiled at his re∣ceiving the charge; immediately the sky purpledon that side to which he turned, and double day at once broke in upon me.</P>

<P>I Was considering last night, when I could not sleep, how noble a part of the creation Man was design'd to be, and how distinguished in all his actions above other earthly creatures. From whence I fell to take a view of the change and corruption which he has in∣troduced into his own condition, the groveling appe∣tites, the mean characters of sense, and wild courses of passions, that cast him from the degree in which Pro∣vidence had placed him, the debasing himself with qua∣lifications not his own, and his degenerating into a lower sphere of action. This inspired me with a mix∣ture of contempt and anger; which, however, was not so violent as to hinder the return of sleep, but grew confused as that came upon me, and made me end my
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>reflections with giving mankind the opprobrious names of inconsiderate, mad and foolish.</P>
<P>Here methought, where my waking reason left the subject, my fancy pursued it in a dream; and I ima∣gined myself in a loud soliloquy of passion, railing at my species, and walking hard to get rid of the com∣pany I despised; when two men who had over-heard me made up on either hand. These I observed had many features in common, which might occasion the mistake of the one for the other in those to whom they appear single, but I, who saw them together, could ea∣sily perceive, that tho' there was an air of severity in each, it was tempered with a natural sweetness in the one, and by turns constrained or tussled by the designs of malice in the other.</P>
<P>I was at a loss to know the reason of their joining me so briskly, when he whose appearance displeased me most, thus addressed his companion. Pray, brother, let him alone, and we shall immediately see him trans∣formed into a Tyger. This struck me with horror, which the other perceived, and pitying my disorder, bid me be of good courage, for tho' I had been savage in my treatment of mankind, (whom I should rather reform than rail against) he would, however, endeavour to re∣scue me from my danger. At this I looked a little more chearful, and while I testified my resignation to him, ve saw the angry brother sling away from us in a pas∣sion for his disappointment. Being now left to my
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>friend, I went back with him at his desire, that might know the meaning of those words which so affright∣ted me.</P>
<P>As we went along, to inform you, says he, with whom you have this adventure, my name is REPROOF and his REPROACH, both born of the same mother, but of different fathers. TRUTH is our common parent. FRIENDSHIP. who saw her, fell in love with her, and she being pleased with him, he begat me upon her; but a while after ENMITY lying in ambush for her, be∣came the father of him whom you saw along with me. The temper of our mother enclines us to the fame sort of business, the informing mankind of their faults; but the differing complexions of our fathers make us dif∣fer in our designs and company. I have a natural be∣nevolence in my mind which engages me with friends, and he a natural impetuosity in his, which casts him among enemies.</P>
<P>As he thus discoursed he came to a place where there were three entrances into as many several walks, which lay beside one another. We passed into the middlemost, a plain, strait, regular walk, set with trees, which ad∣ded to the beauty of the place, but did not so close their boughs over head as to exclude the light from it. Here as we walked I was made to observe, how the road on one hand was full of rocks and precipices, o∣ver which REPROACH (who had already gotten thither) was furiously driving unhappy wretches; the other side
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>was all laid out in gardens of gaudy tulips, amongst whose leaves the serpents wreath'd, and at the end of every grassy walk the enchantress FLATTERY was weav∣ing bowers to lull souls asleep in. We continued still walking on the middle way, 'till we arrived in a build∣ing in which it terminated. This was formerly erected by TRUTH for a watch tower, from whence she took a view of the earth, and, as she saw occasion, sent out REPROOF, or even REPROACH, for our reformation. Over the door I took notice that a face was carved with a heart upon the lips of it, and presently call'd to mind that this was the ancients emblem of SINCERITY. In the entrance I met with FREEDOM OF SPEECH and COMPLAISANCE, who had for a long time looked upon one another as enemies; but REPROOF has so happily brought them together, that they now act as friends and fellow-agents in the same family. Before I ascend∣ed up the stairs, I had my eyes purified by a water which made me see extremely clear, and I think they said it sprung in a pit, from whence (as Democritus had reported) they formerly brought up TRUTH, who had hid herself in it. I was then admitted to the upper chamber of prospect, which was called THE KNOW∣LEDGE OF MANKIND; here the window was no sooner opened but I perceived the clouds to roll off and part before me, and a scene of all the variety of the world presented itself.</P>
<P>But how different was mankind in this view, from
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>what it used to appear! methought the very shape of most of them was lost; some had the heads of Dogs, o∣thers of Apes or Parrots, and in short, where-ever any one took upon him the inferior and unworthy qualities of other creatures, the change of his soul became vi∣sible in his countenance. The strutting pride of him who is endued with brutality instead of courage, made his face shoot out in the form of a Horse's; his eyes be∣came prominent, his nostrils widened, and his wig un∣tying flowed down on one side of his neck in a waving mane. The talkativeness of those who love the ill-na∣ture of conversation made them turn into assemblies of Geese, their lips hardened into bills by eternal us∣ing, they gabbled for diversion, they hiss'd in scandal, and their ruffles falling back on their arms, a succession of little feathers appeared, which formed wings for them to flutter with from one visit to another. The envious and malicious lay on the ground with the heads of different sorts of Serpents, and not endeavouring to erect themselves, but meditating mischief to others, they suck'd the poison of the earth, sharpened their tongues to stings upon the stones, and rolled their trains unperceivably beneath their habits. The hypo∣critical oppressors wore the faces of Crocodiles, their mouths were instruments of cruelty, their eyes of de∣ceit; they committed wickedness, and bemoaned that there should be so much of it in the world; they de∣voured the unwary, and wept over the remains of them.
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>The covetous had so hook'd and worn their fingers by counting interest upon interest, that they converted to the claws of Harpies, and these they still were stretch∣ing out for more, yet seem'd unsatisfied with their ac∣quisitions. The sharpers had the looks of Camelions; they every minute changed their appearance, and fed on swarms of Flies which fell as so many Collies a∣mongst them. The bully seemed a dunghil Cock, he crested well, and bore his comb aloft; he was beaten by almost every one, yet still sung for triumph; and only the mean coward prick'd up the ears of a Hare to fly before him. Critics were turned into Cats, whose plea∣sure and grumbling go together. Fopes were Apes in embroidered jackets. Flatterers were curled Spaniels, sawning and crouching. The crafty had the face of a Fox, the slothful of an Ass, the cruel of a Wolf, the ill-bred of a bear, the leachers were Goats, and the gluttons Swine. Drunkenness was the only vice that did not change the face of its professors into that of another creature; but this I took to be far from a pri∣vilege, for these two reasons; because it sufficiently deforms them of itself, and because none of the lower ranks of beings is guilty of so foolish an intempe∣rance.</P>
<P>As I was taking a view of these representations of things, without any more order than is usual in a dream, or in the confusion of the world itself, I per∣ceived a concern within me for what I saw; my eyes
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>began to moisten, and as if the virtue of that water with which they were purified was lost for a time, by their being touched with that which arose from a pas∣sion, the clouds immediately began to gather again, and close from either hand upon the prospect I then turn∣ed towards my guide, who addressed himself to me af∣ter this manner. You have seen the condition of man∣kind when it descends from its dignity; now there∣fore guard yourself from that degeneracy by a modest greatness of spirit on one side, and a conscious shame on the other. Endeavour also with a generosity of goodness to make your friends aware of it; let them know what defects you perceive are growing upon them; handle the matter as you see reason, either with the airs of severe or humourous affection; sometimes plainly describing the degeneracy in its full proper co∣lours, or at other times letting them know that if they proceed as they have begun, you give them to such a day or so many months to turn Bears, Wolves, or Foxes, &amp;c. Neither neglect your more remote ac∣quaintance, where you see any worthy and susceptible of admonition; expose the beasts whose qualities you see them putting on, where you have no mind to en∣gage with their persons. The possibility of their ap∣plying this is very obvious: the Egyptians saw it so clearly, that they made the pictures of animals explain their minds to one another instead of writing; and
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>indeed it is hardly to be missed, since Aesop took them out of their mute condition, and taught them to speak for themselves with relation to the actions of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>VISION IV. GUARDIAN. N<SUP>o</SUP> 66.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a sett of mankind, who are wholly employed in the ill-natured office of gathering up a collection of stories that lessen the reputation of others, and spreading them abroad with a certain air of satisfaction. Perhaps, indeed, an innocent and unmean∣ing curiosity, a desire of being informed concerning those we live with, or a willingness to prosit by reflection upon the actions of others, may sometimes afford an excuse, or sometimes a defence, for inquisitiveness; but certainly it is beyond all excuse, a transgression against huma∣nity, to carry the matter further, to tear off the dres∣sings, as I may say, from the wounds of a friend, and expose them to the air in cruel fits of diversion; and yet we have something more to bemoan, an outrage of an higher nature, which mankind is guilty of when they are not content to spread the stories of folly, frail∣ty and vice, but even enlarge them, or invent new ones, and blacken characters that we may appear ri∣diculous,
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>or hateful to one another. From such prac∣tices as these it happens, that some feel a sorrow, and others are agitated with a spirit of revenge; that scan∣dals or lies are told, because another has told such be∣fore; that resentments and quarrels arise, and injuries are given, received, and multiplied, in a scene of ven∣geance.</P>
<P>All this I have often observed with abundance of concern; and having a perfect desire to further the hap∣piness of mankind, I lately set myself to consider the causes from whence such evils arise, and the remedies which may be applied. Whereupon I shut my eyes to prevent distraction from outward objects, and a while after shot away, upon an impulse of thought, into the WORLD OF IDEAS, where abstracted qualities became visible in such appearances as wer agreeable to each of their natures.</P>
<P>That part of the country, where I happened to light, was the most noisy that I had ever known. The winds whistled, the leaves rustled, the brooks rumbled, the birds chatter'd, the tongues of men were heard, and the echo mingled something of every sound in its repe∣tition, so that there was a strange confusion and up∣roar of sounds about me. At length, as the noise still encreased, I could discern a man habited like a herald (and as I afterwards understood) called NOVELTY, that came forward proclaiming a solemn day to be kept at the house of COMMON FAME. Immediately behind him
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>advanced three nymphs, who had mostrous appear∣ances. The first of these was CURIOSITY, habited like a virgin, and having an hundred ears upon her head to serve in her inquiries. The second of these was TAL∣KATIVENESS, a little better grown, she seemed to be like a young wife, and had an hundred tongues to spread her stories. The third was CENSORIOUSNESS, habited like a widow, and surrounded with an hundred squinting eyes of a malignant influence, which so ob∣liquely darted on all around, that it was impossible to say which of them had brought in the informations she boasted of. These, as I was informed, had been very instrumental in preserving and rearing COMMON FAME, when upon her birth-day she was shuffled into a crowd, to escape the search which TRUTH might have made after her and her parents. CURIOSITY found here there, TALKATIVENESS convey'd her a∣way, and CENSORIOUSNESS so nursed her up, that in a short time she grew to a prodigious size, and obtain∣ed an empire over the universe; wherefore the POWER, in gratitude for these services, has since advanced them to her highest employments. The next who came for∣ward in this procession was a light damsel, called CRE∣DULITY, who carried behind them the lamp, the sil∣ver vessel with a spout, and other instruments proper for this solemn occasion. She had formerly seen these three together, and conjecturing from the number of their ears, tongues and eyes, that they might be the
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>proper Genii of ATTENTION, FAMILIAR CONVERSE, and OCULAR DEMONSTRATION, she from that time gave herself up to attend them. The last who followed were some who had closely muffled themselves in up∣per garments, so that I could not discern who they were; but just as the soremost of them was come up, I am glad, says she, calling me by my name, to meet you at this time, stay close by me, and take a strict ob∣servation of all that passes. Her voice was sweet and commanding, I thought I had somewhere heard it; and from her, as I went along, I learned the meaning of every thing which offered.</P>
<P>We now marched forward thro' the ROOKERY OF RUMOURS, which flew thick and with a terrible din all around us. At length we arrived at the house of COMMON FAME, where a hecatomb of REPUTATIONS was that day to fall for her pleasure. The house stood upon an eminence, having a thousand passages to it, and a thousand whispering holes for the conveyance of found. The hall we entered was formed with the art of a music chamber for the improvement of noises. REST and SILENCE are banished the place. STORIES of different natures wander in light flocks all about, sometimes truths and lies, or sometimes lies themselves clashing against one another. In the middle stood a table painted after the manner of the remotest Asiatic countries, upon which the lamp, the silver vessel, and cups of a white earth, were planted in order. Then
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>dried herbs were brought, collected for the solemnity in moon-shine, and water being put to them, there was a greenish liquor made, to which they added the flower of milk, and an extraction from the canes of America, for performing a libation to the infer∣nal POWERS OF MISCHIEF. After this, CURIOSITY, retiring to a withdrawing-room, brought forth the VICTIMS, being to appearance a sett of small waxen images, which she laid upon the table one after ano∣ther. Immediately TALKATIVENESS gave each of them the name of some one, whom for the time they were to represent; and CENSORIOUSNESS stuck them all about with black pins, still pronouncing at every one she stuck, something to the prejudice of the per∣sons represented. No sooner were these rites perform∣ed, and incantations uttered, but the sound of a speak∣ing trumpet was heard in the air, by which they knew the Deity of the place was propitiated and assisting. Upon this the sky grew darker, a storm arose, and mur∣murs, sighs, groans, cries, and the words of grief or re∣sentment were heard within it. Thus the three Sor∣ceresses discovered, that they, whose names they had given to the images, were already affected with what was done to them in essigy. The knowledge of this was received with the loudest laughter, and in many congratulatory words they applauded one another's wit and power.</P>
<P>As matters were at this high point of disorder, the
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>muffled lady, whom I attended on, being no longer able to endure such barbarous proceedings, threw off her upper garment of RESERVE, and appeared to be TRUTH. As soon as she had confessed herself present, the speaking trumpet ceas'd to sound, the sky cleared up, the storm abated, the noises which were heard in it ended, the laughter of the company was over, and a serene light, till then unknown to the place, was dif∣fused around it. At this the detected Sorceresses en∣deavoured to escape in a cloud which I saw began to thicken about them, but it was soon dispersed, their charms being controuled and prevailed over by the su∣perior Divinity. For my part I was exceedingly glad to see it so, and began to consider what punishments she would inflict upon them. I fancied it would be proper to cut off CURIOSITY'S ears, and six them to the eaves of the houses, to nail the tongue of TALKATIVENESS to Indian tables, and to put out the eyes of CENSO∣RIOUSNESS with a flash of her light. In respect of CREDULITY I had indeed some little pity, and had I been judge, she might, perhaps, have escaped with a hearty reproof.</P>
<P>But I soon found that the discerning Judge had o∣ther designs, she knew, them for such as will not be de∣stroyed entirely while mankind is in being, and yet ought to have a brand and punishment affixed to them that they may be avoided. Wherefore she took a seat for judgment, and had the Criminals brought forward
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>by SHAME ever blushing, and TROUBLE with a whip of many lashes, two phantoms who had dogged the Procession in disguise, and waited till they had an au∣thority from TRUTH to lay hands upon them. Imme∣diately then she ordered CURIOSITY and TALKATIVE∣NEES to be fettered together, that the one should never suffer the other to rest, nor the other ever let her re∣main undiscovered. Light CREDULITY she linkt to SHAME at the tormenter's own request, who was pleas∣ed to be thus secure that her prisoner should not e∣scape; and this was done partly for her punishment, and partly for her amendment. CENSORIOUSNESS was also in like manner begged by TROUBLE, and had her assign'd for an eternal companion. After they were thus chain'd with one another, by the judge's order, she drove them from the presence to wander for ever thro' the world, with NOVELTY stalking before them.</P>
<P>The cause being now over, she retreated from sight within the splendor of her own glory, which leaving the house it had brightned, the sounds that were pro∣per to the place began to be as loud and consused as when we entered, and there being no longer a clear distinguished appearance of any objects represented to me, I returned from the excursion I had made in fancy.</P>

<HEAD>VISION V.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER industry and eagerness the modern discoverers have shewn for the knowledge of new countries, there yet remains an ample field in the creation to which they are utter strangers, and which all the methods of travelling hitherto invented, will never bring them acquainted with. Of this I can give a very particular instance in an accident which lately happened to me.</P>
<P>As I was on the 6th of this instant, being Febru∣ary 1715, walking with my eyes cast upward, I fell into a reflection on the vast tracts of air which ap∣pear'd before me as uninhabited. And wherefore, said I to myself, shou'd all this space be created? can it only be for an odd bird to fly through, as now and then a man may pass a desart? Or are there also kingdoms with their particular polities and people of a species which we know nothing of, ordain'd to live in it?</P>
<P>It was in this manner I continued my thought, when my feet forsook the level, and I was insensibly mounted in the air, till I arriv'd at a footing as firm
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>and level as what I had left. But with what surprize did I find myself among creatures distinct from us in shape and customs?</P>
<P>The inhabitants are of a small stature, below those which history describes for Pigmies. The tallest of them exceed not fourteen or fifteen inches, and the least are hardly three. This difference proceeds only from their growth before they are brought to light; for af∣ter we never observe them to grow, unless it please their parents, who have this uncommon method of enabling them: they recall them to the womb, where having been for some time, they receive an addition to their bulk, then go back to their houses, and continue at a stand as they did before. The experiment has been often try'd with success, but some have suffered ex∣tremely by undergoing it.</P>
<P>Their skins are like the ancient Britain, all drawn over with a variety of figures. The colour made use of for this end, is generally black. I have indeed observ∣ed in some of the religious, and lawyers of the country, red here and there intermingled, tho' not so common∣ly of late. They tell me too, they often us'd to paint with all colours; and I visited two or three of the old inhabitants, who were adorn'd in that fashion: but this is now disused, since the new inventions, by which the use of a black fountain that belongs to that coun∣try, is render'd more useful and serviceable.</P>
<P>The Cloaths in which they go clad, are the skins
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>of beasts; worn by some plain, by others with figure: wrought upon them. Gold is also made use of by some, to beautify their apparel; but very seldom silver, un∣less, as buckles are by us, for fastening the garment be∣fore. I have seen some of them go like seamen in thin blue shirts, others like Indians in a party-colour'd loose kind of apparel, and others who they told me were the Politicians of the country, go about stark naked.</P>
<P>The manner of dressing them is this: at first when they come into the world, they have a suit given them, which if it do not fit exactly, is not, as with us, fitted up again, but the children are in a cruel manner cut and squeez'd to bring them to its proportion. Yet this they seem not much to regard, provided their princi∣pal parts are not affected. When the dress is thus set∣tled on them, they are clad for life, it being seldom their custom to alter it, or put it off: in short, they live in it night and day, and wear it to rags rather than part with it, being sure of the same torture, and a great∣er danger if they should be dress'd a second time. I have further taken notice, that they delight to go o∣pen breasted, most of them shewing their bosoms speck∣led. Some Lawyers indeed wear them quite white, perhaps for distinction sake, or to be known at a dis∣tance. But the finest shew is among the beaux and la∣dies, who mightily affect something of gold, both be∣fore and behind them.</P>
<P>Food I never saw them eat; they being a people,
<PB N="141" REF="144"/>who, as I observed, live in air: their houses are all single and high, having no back rooms, but frequent∣ly seven or eight stories, which are all separate houses above one another. They have one gate to their city, and generally no doors to their houses; tho' I have sometimes seen them have particular doors, and even made of glass, where the inhabitants have been ob∣serv'd to stand many days, that their fine apparel may be seen thro' them. If at any time they lie down, which they do when they come from their habitations (as if coming abroad were their greatest fatigue) they will lie together in heaps without receiving hurt: though the soundest sleep they get, is when they can have dust e∣nough to cover them over.</P>
<P>The females amongst them are but few, nothing be∣ing there produced by a marriage of sexes. The males are of a different strength or endowment of parts, some having knowledge in an extream degree, and others none at all; yet at the same time, they are mighty pre∣tenders to instruct others. Their Names, (for as many as wou'd discover them to me) I observ'd to be the very same as ours are upon earth; I met a few who made theirs a mystery, but why, I am yet to learn. They are so communicative, that they will tell all the knowledge they boast, if a stranger apply himself to their conversation: and this may be worth his while, if he considers that all languages, arts, and sciences, are profest amongst them. I think I may say it with∣out
<PB N="142" REF="145"/>vanity, that I knew a certain Talisman, with pro∣per figures and characters inscrib'd, whereby their great∣est people may be charm'd, brought to reside with a man, and serve him like a familiar in the conduct of life.</P>
<P>There is no such thing as fighting amongst them, but their controversies are determin'd by words, where∣in they seldom own themselves conquer'd, yet proceed no further than two or three replies: perhaps indeed two others take up their neighbour's quarrel, but then they desist too after the same manner; sometimes how∣ever, blows have ensu'd upon their account, though not amongst them: in such a case they have descended to inspire mankind with their sentiments, and chosen champions from among us, in order to decide it.</P>
<P>The time of their life is very different, some die as soon as born, and others in their youth; some get a new lease of life by their entring into the womb again, and if any weather it out to a hundred years, they ge∣nerally live on to an extreme age. After which it is remarkable, that instead of growing weaker as we do, by time, they increase in strength, and become at last so confirm'd in health, that it is the opinion of their country, they never can perish while the world re∣mains.</P>
<P>The sicknesses which may take them of, besides what happens from their natural weakness of body, are of different sorts. One is over-moisture, which affec∣ting their mansions; makes them lose their complexi∣ons,
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>become deform'd, and rot away insensibly: this is often obviated by their not keeping too much with∣in doors. Another is the Worms, which prey upon their bowels: if they be maimed by accidents, they become like us, so far useless; and that maim will some time or other be the occasion of their ruin. However, they perish by these means only in appearance, and like spirits, who vanish in one place, to be seen in a∣nother. But as men die of passions, so Disesteem is what the most nearly touches them; then they with∣draw into holes and corners, and consume away in darkness. Or if they are kept alive a few days by the force of Spices, it is but a short reprieve from their perishing to eternity; without any honour, but that instead of a burial, a small pyre of Past should be erec∣ted over them, while they, like the antient Romans, are reduc'd to ashes.<NOTE PLACE="foot">N.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<PB REF="148"/>
<P>HAVING some time ago heard, that the Translation of HOMER'S ILIAD would be attempted, I resolv'd to confer with the gentleman who undertook it. I found him of a tall presence, and thoughtful countenance, with his hands folded, his eyes fix'd, and his beard untrimm'd. This I took to be a good omen, because he thus resembled the Constantino∣politan statue of Homer which Cedrenus describes; and sure∣ly nothing cou'd have been liker, had he but arriv'd at the character of age and blindness. As my business was to be my introduction, I told him how much I was acquainted with the secret history of Homer; that no one better knows his own horse, than I do the camel of Bactria, in which his soul resided at the time of the Trojan wars; that my acquaintance conti∣nued with him, as he appear'd in the person of the Grecian poet; that I knew him in his next transmigration into a pea∣cock; was pleas'd with his return to manhood, under the name of Ennius at Rome; and more pleas'd to hear he wou'd soon revive under another name, with all his full lustre, in England. This particular knowledge, added I, which sprung from the love I bear him, has made me fond of a conversation with you, in order to the success of your translation.</P>
<P>The civil manner in which he received my proposal en∣couraging me to proceed, I told him, there were arts of suc∣cess, as well as merits to obtain it; and that he, who now dealt in Greek, should not only satisfy himself with being a good Grecian, but also contrive to hasten into the repute of it. He might therefore write in the title-page, TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL GREEK, and select a motto for his purpose out of the same language. He might obtain a copy of verses written in it to prefix to the work; and not call the titles of each book, the first, and second, but ILIAD ALPHA, and BETA. He might retain some names which the world is least acquainted with, as his old translator Chapman uses E∣phaistus
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>instead of Vulcan, Baratrum for Hell; and if the notes were filled with Greek verses, it wou'd more increase the wonder of many readers. Thus I went on; when he told me smiling, I had shewn him indeed a set of arts very diffe∣rent from merit, for which reason, he thought, he ought not to depend upon them. A success, says he, founded on the ig∣norance of others, may bring a temporary advantage, but nei¦ther a conscious satisfaction, nor future fame to the author. Men of sense despise the affectation which they easily see through, and even they who were dazzled with it at first, are no sooner inform'd of its being an affectation, but they ima∣gine it also a veil to cover imperfection.</P>
<P>The next point I ventur'd to speak on, was the sort of poe∣try he intended to use; how some may fancy, a poet of the greatest fire would be imitated better in the freedom of blank verse, and the description of war sounds more pompous out of rhime. But, will the translation, said he, be thus remov'd e∣nough from prose, without greater inconveniences? what transpositions is Milton forc'd to, as an equivalent for want of rhime, in the poetry of a language which depends upon a natural order of words? And even this would not have done his business, had he not given the fullest scope to his genius, by chusing a subject upon which there could be no hyperboles. We see (however he be deservedly successful) that the ridi∣cule of his manner succeeds better than the imitation of it; because transpositions, which are unnatural to a language, are to be fairly derided, if they ruin it by being frequently in∣troduced; and because hyperboles, which outrage every les∣ser subject where they are seriously us'd, are often beautiful in ridicule. Let the French, whose language is not copious, translate in prose; but ours, which exceeds it in copiousness of words, may have a more frequent likeness of sounds, to make the unison or rhime easier; a grace of music, that atones for the harshness our consonants and monosyllables occasion.</P>
<P>After this, I demanded what air he would appear with? whether antiquated, like Chapman's Version, or modern, like
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>La Motte's Contraction. To which he answer'd, by desiring me to observe what a painter does who would always have his pieces in fashion. He neither chuses to draw a beauty in a ruff, or a French-head; but with its neck uncover'd, and in its natural ornament of hair curl'd up, or spread becoming∣ly so may a writer chuse a natural manner of expressing himself which will always be in fashion, without affecting to borrow an odd solemnity and unintelligible pomp from the past times, or humouring the present by falling into its af∣fectations, and those phrases which are born to die with it.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, lastly, whether he would be strictly literal, or expatiate with further licences? I would not be literal, re∣plies he, or ty'd up to line for line in such a manner wherein it is impossible to express in one language what has been de∣liver'd in another. Neither wou'd I so expatiate, as to alter my Author's sentiments, or add others of my own. These errors are to be avoided on either hand, by adhering not only to the word, but the spirit and genius of an author; by con∣sidering what he means, with what beautiful manner he has express'd his meaning in his own tongue, and how he wou'd have express'd himself, had it been in ours. Thus we ought to seek for Homer in a version of Homer: other attempts are but transformations of him; such as Ovid tells us, where the name is retain'd, and the thing alter'd: this will be really what you mention'd in the compliment you began with, a transmigration of the Poet from one country into another.</P>
<P>Here ended the serious part of our conference. All I re∣member further was, that having ask'd him, what he design'd with all those editions and comments I observ'd in his room he made answer, that if any one, who had a mind to find fault with his performance, wou'd but stay 'till it was entirely fi∣nish'd, he shou'd have a very cheap bargain of them.</P>
<P>Since this discourse, I have often resolv'd to try what it was to translate in the spirit of a writer, and at last, chose THE BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE, which is ascrib'd to Homer; and bears a nearer resemblance, to his Iliad, than
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>the Culex does to the Acneid of Virgil. Statius and others think it a work of youth, written as a prelude to his greater poems. Chapman thinks it the work of his age, after he found men ungrateful; to shew he cou'd give strength, line∣age and fame as he pleas'd, and praise a Mouse as well as a Man. Thus, says he, the Poet professedly flung up the world, and apply'd himself at last to hymns. Now, tho' this reason of his may be nothing more than a scheme form'd out of the order in which Homer's works are printed, yet does the con∣jecture that this poem was written after the Iliad, appear probable, because of its frequent allusions to that poem; and particularly that there is not a Frog or a Mouse kill'd, which has not its parallel instance there, in the death of some war∣rior or other.</P>
<P>The poem itself is of the Epic kind; the time of its action the duration of two days; the subject (however its nature fri∣volous, or ridiculous) rais'd, by having the most shining words and deeds of Gods and Heroes accommodated to it: and while other poems often compare the illustrious exploits of great men to those of brutes, this always heightens the sub∣ject by comparisons drawn from things above it. We have a great character given it with respect to the fable in Gaddius de Script non Eccles. It appears, says he, nearer perfection than the Iliad, or Odysses, and excels both in judgment, wit, and exquisite texture, since it is a poem perfect in its own kind. Nor does Crusius speak less to its honour, with respect to the moral, when he cries out in an apostrophe to the reader; <Q>Whoever you are, mind not the names of these little ani∣mals, but look into the things they mean; call them men, call them kings, or counsellors, or human polity itself, you have here doctrines of every sort.</Q> And indeed, when I hear the Frog talk concerning the Mouse's family, I learn, e∣quality shou'd be observ'd in making friendships; when I hear the Mouse answer the Frog, I remember, that a similitude of manners shou'd be regarded in them; when I see their coun∣cils assembling, I think of the bustles of human prudence:
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>and when I see the battle grow warm and glorious, our strug∣gles for honour and empire appear before me.</P>
<P>This piece had many imitations of it in antiquity, as the sight of the Cats, the Cranes, the Starlings, the Spiders, &amp;c. That of the Cats is in the Bodleian library, but I was not so lucky as to find it. I have taken the liberty to divide my trans∣lation into books (tho' it be otherwise in the original) accord∣ing as the fable allow'd proper resting-places, by varying its scene, or nature of action: this I did, after the example of Aristarchus and Zenodotus in the Iliad. I then thought of carrying the grammarians example further, and placing ar∣guments at the head of each, which I fram'd as follows, in imitation of the short ancient Greek inscriptions to the Iliad,
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>BOOK I.</LABEL> In ALPHA, the ground Of the quarrel is found.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>BOOK II.</LABEL> In BETA, we The council see.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>BOOK III.</LABEL> Dire GAMMA relates The work of the fates.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But as I am averse from all information which lessens our surprize, I only mention these for a handle to quarrel with the custom of long arguments before a poem. It may be necessary in books of controversy or abstruse learning, to write an epi∣tome before each part; but it is not kind to forestal us in the work of fancy, and make our attention remiss, by a previous account of the end of it.</P>
<P>The next thing which employ'd my thoughts was the he∣roes names. It might perhaps take off somewhat from the majesty of the poem, had I cast away such noble sounds as, Physignathus, Lycopinax, and Crambophagus, to substitute Bluffcheek, Lickdish and Cabbage-eater in their places. It is for this reason I have retain'd them untranslated: however, I place them in English before the poem, and sometimes give
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>a sfort character extracted out of their names; as in Poly∣phonus, Pternophagus, &amp;c. that the reader may not want some light of their humour in the original.</P>
<P>But what gave me a greater difficulty was, to know how I shou'd follow the poet, when he inserted pieces of lines from his Iliad, and struck out a sprightliness by their new applica∣tion. To supply this in my translation, I have added one or two of Homer's particularities; and us'd two or three allusi∣ons to some of our English poets who most resemble him, to keep up some image of this spirit of the original with an e∣quivalent beauty. To use more, might make my perfor∣mance seem a cento rather than a translation, to those who know not the necessity I lay under.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant, after all my care, how the world re∣ceives the best compositions of this nature. A man need only go to a painter's, and apply what he hears said of a pic∣ture to a translation, to find how he shall be us'd upon his own, or his author's account. There one spectator tells you, a piece is extremely fine, but he sets no value on what is not like the face it was drawn for; while a second informs you, such another is extremely like, but he cares not for a piece of deformity, tho' its likeness be never so exact.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding all which happens to the best, when I translate, I have a desire to be reckon'd amongst them; and I shall obtain this, if the world will be so good-natur'd as to believe writers that give their own characters: upon which presumption, I answer to all objections beforehand, as follows:</P>
<P>When I am literal, I regard my author's words; when I am not, I translate in his spirit. If I am low, I chuse the nar∣rative style; if high, the subject requir'd it. When I am e∣nervate, I give an instance of ancient simplicity; when affec∣ted, I show a point of modern delicacy. As for beauties, there never can be one found in me which was not really intended; and for any faults, they proceeded from too unbounded fan∣cy, or too nice judgment, but by no means from any defect in either of those faculties.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY who have discours'd concerning the na∣ture and extent of criticism, take notice, that editions of authors, the interpretations of them, and the judgment which is pass'd upon each, are the three branches into which the art divides itself. But the last of these, that directs in the choice of books, and takes care to prepare us for reading them, is by the learned Bacon call'd the Chair of the Critics. In this chair (to carry on the figure) have sate Aristotle, De∣metrius Phaleraeus, Dionysius Halicarnassensis, Ci∣cero, Horace, Quintilian, and Longinus; all great names of antiquity, the censors of those ages which went before, and the directors of those that come after them, with respect to the natural and perspicuous man∣ners of thought and a expression, by which a correct and
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>judicious genius may be able to write for the pleasure and profit of mankind.</P>
<P>But whatever has been advanc'd by men really great in themselves, has been also attempted by others of capacities either unequal to the undertaking, or which have been corrupted by their passions, and drawn away into partial violences: so that we have sometimes seen the province of Criticism usurp'd, by such who judge with an obscure diligence, and a cer∣tain dryness of understanding, incapable of compre∣hending a figurative stile, or being mov'd by the beau∣ties of imagination; and at other times by such, whose natural moroseness in general, or particular designs of envy, has render'd them indefatigable against the repu∣tation of others.</P>
<P>In this last manner is ZOILUS represented to us by antiquity, and with a character so abandon'd, that his name has been since made use of to brand all succeed∣ing critics of his complexion. He has a load of in∣famy thrown upon him, great, in proportion to the fame of HOMER, against whom he oppos'd himself: if the one was esteem'd as the very residence of wit, the other is describ'd as a profligate, who wou'd destroy the temple of Apollo and the Muses, in order to have his memory preserv'd by the envious action. I imagine it maybe no ungrateful undertaking to write some ac∣count of this celebrated person, from whom so many derive their character; and I think the life of a Cri∣tic
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>is not unseasonably put before the works of his Poet, especially when his censures accompany him. If what he advances be just, he stands here as a censor; if otherwise, he appears as an addition to the poet's fame, and is placed before him with the justice of an∣tiquity in its sacrifices, when, because such a beast had offended such a deity, he was brought annually to his altar to be slain upon it.</P>
<P>ZOILUS us was born at Amphipolis a city of Thrace, during the time in which the Macedonian empire flou∣rish'd. Who his parents were, is not certainly known; but if the appellation of Thracian Slave, which the world apply'd to him, be not merely an expression of contempt, it proves him of mean extraction. He was a disciple of one Polycrates a sophist, who had distin∣guish'd himself by writing against the great names of the ages before him; and who, when he is mention'd as his master, is said to be particularly famous for a bitter accusation or invective against the memory of Socrates. In this manner is ZOILUS set out to poste∣rity, like a plant naturally baneful, and having its poi∣son render'd more acute and subtle by a preparation.</P>
<P>In his person he was tall and meagre, his comple∣xion was pale, and all the motions of his face were sharp. He is represented by Aelian, with a beard nou∣rish'd to a prodigious length, and his head kept close shav'd, to give him a magisterial appearance: his coat hung over his knees in a slovenly fashion; his man∣ners
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>were form'd upon an aversion to the customs of the world. He was fond of speaking ill, diligent to sow dissension, and from the constant bent of his thought, had obtain'd that sort of readiness for slander or re∣proach, which is esteem'd wit by the light opinion of some, who take the remarks of ill-nature, for an un∣derstanding of mankind, and the abrupt lashes of rude∣ness for the spirit of expression. This, at last, grew to such a height in him, that he became careless of con∣cealing it; he threw off all reserves and managements in respect of others, and the passion so far took the turn of a frenzy, that being one day ask'd, why he spoke ill of every one? <Q>It is (says he) because I am not able to do them ill, tho' I have so great a mind to it.</Q> Such extravagant declarations of his general enmity made men deal with him as with the creature he affected to be; they no more spoke of him as be∣longing to the species he hated; and from henceforth his learned speeches or fine remarks cou'd obtain no other title for him, but that of THE RHETORICAL DOG.</P>
<P>While he was in Macedon he employ'd his time in writing, and reciting what he had written in the schools of sophists. His oratory (says Dionysius Halicarnas∣sensis) was always of the demonstrative kind, which concerns itself about praise or dispraise. His subjects were the most approv'd authors, whom he chose to a∣buse upon the account of their reputation; and to
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>whom, without going round the matter in faint praises or artificial insinuations, he us'd to deny their own characteristics. With this gallantry of opposition did he censure Xenophon for affectation, Plato for vulgar notions, and Isocrates for incorrectness. Demosthe∣nes, in his opinion, wanted fire, Aristotle subtilty, and Aristophanes humour. But, as to have reputation was with him a sufficient cause of enmity, so to have that reputation universal, was what wrought his frenzy to its wildest degree; for which reason it was HOMER with whom he was most implacably angry. And cer∣tainly, if envy choose its object for the power to give torment, it shou'd here (if ever) have the glory of ful∣ly answering its intentions; for the Poet was so wor∣ship'd by the whole age, that his Critic had not the common alleviation of the opinion of one other man, to concur in his condemnation.</P>
<P>ZOILUS however went on with indefatigable indus∣try in a voluminous work, which he intitled, THE <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or CENSURE OF HOMER: 'till having at last finish'd it, he prepares to send it into the world with a pompous title at the head, invented for himself by way of excel∣lency, and thus inserted after the manner of the anci∣ents.</P>
<Q>ZOILUS, the scourge of HOMER, writ this against that lover of fables.</Q>
<P>Thus did he value himself upon a work, which the world has not thought worth transmitting to us, and
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>but just left a specimen in five or six quotations, which happen to be preserv'd by the commentators of that Poet against whom he writ it. If any one be fond to form a judgment upon him from these instances, they are as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>IL. 1. He says, HOMER is very ridiculous (a word he was noted to apply to him) when he makes such a God as APOLLO employ himself in killing dogs and mules.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IL. 5. HOMER is very ridiculous in describing DIO∣MEDES' helmet and armour, as sparkling, and in a blaze of fire about him; for then why was he not burn'd by it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>IL. 5. When IDAEUS quitted his fine chariot, which was entangl'd in the fight, and for which he might have been slain, the Poet was a fool for making him leave his chariot, he had better have run away in it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IL. 24. When ACHILLES makes PRIAM lie out of his tent, lest the Greeks shou'd hear of his being there, the Poet had no breeding, to turn a king out in that manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>OD. 9. The Poet says, ULYSSES lost an equal num∣ber out of each ship. The Critic says, that's impos∣sible.</ITEM>
<ITEM>OD. 10. He derides the men who were turn'd into swine, and calls them HOMER'S poor little blubbering pigs. The first five of these remarks are found in DI∣DYMUS, the last in LONGINUS.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160"/>Such as these are the cold jests and trifling quar∣rels, which have been registred from a composition, that (according to the representation handed down to us) was born in envy, liv'd a short life in contempt, and lies for ever bury'd with infamy.</P>
<P>But, as his design was judg'd by himself wonder∣fully well accomplish'd, Macedon began to be esteem'd a stage too narrow for his glory; and Egypt, which had then taken learning into its patronage, the proper place where it ought to diffuse its beams, to the sur∣prize of all whom he wou'd persuade to reckon them∣selves hitherto in the dark, and under the prejudices of a false admiration. However, as he had prepar'd himself for the journey, he was suddenly diverted for a while by the rumour of the Olympic games, which were at that time to be celebrated. Thither he steer'd his course, full of the memory of Herodotus, and o∣thers who had successfully recited in that large assem∣bly; and pleas'd to imagine he shou'd alter all Greece in their notions of wit before he left it.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival, he found the field in its prepara∣tion for diversion. The chariots stood for the race, carv'd and gilded, the horses were led in costly trap∣pings, some practis'd to wrestle, some to dart the spear, (or whatever they design'd to engage at) in a kind of flourish beforehand: others were looking on, to amuse themselves; and all gaily dress'd, according to the cus∣tom of those places. Through these did ZOITUS move
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>forward, bald-headed, bearded to the middle, its a long sad-colour'd vestment, and inflexibly stretching forth his hands fill'd with volumes roll'd up to a vast thick∣ness: a figure most venerably slovenly! able to de∣mand attention upon account of its oddness. And in∣deed, he had no sooner fix'd himself upon an eminence, but a crowd flock'd about him to know what he in∣tended. Then the Critic casting his eyes on the ring, open'd his volume slowly, as considering with what part be might most properly entertain his audience. It happen'd, that the games at Patroclus' obsequies came first into his thought; whether it was that he judg'd it suitable to the place, or knew that he had fall'n as well upon the games themselves, as upon HOMER for celebrating them, and cou'd not resist his natural dispo∣sition to give mankind offence. Every one was now intently fasten'd upon him, while he undertook to prove, that those games signify'd nothing to the taking of Troy, and therefore only furnish'd an impertinent Episode: that the fall of the lesser Ajax in cow-dung, the squabble of the chariot-race, and other accidents which attend such sports, are mean or trifling: and a world of other remarks, for which he still affirm'd HOMER to be a fool, and which they that heard him took for study'd invectives against those exercises they were then employ'd in. Men who frequent sports, as they are of a chearful dispostion, so are they lovers of poetry: this, together with the opinion they were af∣fronted,
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>wrought them up to impatience and further licences: there was particularly a young Athenian gentleman, who was to run three chariots in those games, who being an admirer of HOMER, could no longer contain himself, but cry'd out, <Q>What in the name of CASTOR have we here, ZOILUS from Thrace?</Q> and as he said it, struck him with a chariot-whip. Immediately then a hundred whips were seen curling round his head; so that his face, natural∣ly deform'd, and heighten'd by pain to its utmost Ca∣ricatura, appear'd in the midst of them, as we may fancy the visage of Envy, if at any time her snakes rise in rebellion to lash their mistress. Nor was this all the punishment they decreed him, when once they imagin'd he was ZOILUS: the Scyronian rocks were near 'em, and thither they hurried him with a general cry, to that speedy justice which is practis'd at places of diversion.</P>
<P>It is here, that, according to SUIDAS, the critic ex∣pir'd. But we following the more numerous testimo∣nies of other authors, conclude he escap'd either by the lowness of those rocks whence he was thrust, or by bushes which might break his fall; and soon after following the courses of his first intention, he set sail for Egypt.</P>
<P>Egypt was at this time govern'd by Ptolemy Phi∣ladelphus, a prince passionately fond of learning, and learned men; particularly an admirer of HOMER, to
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>adoration. He had built the finest library in the world, and made the choicest, as well as most numerous col∣lection of books. No encouragements were wanting from him to allure men of the brightest genius to his court, and no time thought too much which he spent in their company. From hence it is that we hear of ERATOSTHENES and ARISTOPHANES, those univer∣sal scholars, and candid judges of other mens perfor∣mances: CALLIMACHUS, a poet of the most easy, courteous delicacy, famous for a poem on the cutting of Berenice's hair, and whom OVID so much admired as to say, <Q>It was reason enough for him to love a woman, if she would but tell him he exceeded CAL∣LIMACHUS;</Q> THEOCRITUS, the most famous in the pastoral way of writing; and among the young men, ARISTARCHUS and APOLLONIUS RHODIUS, the one of whom prov'd a most judicious critic, the other a poet of no mean character.</P>
<P>These and many more fill'd the court of that mu∣nificent prince, whose liberal dispensations of wealth and favour became encouragements to every one to exert their parts to the utmost; like streams which flow through different sorts of soils, and improve each in that for which it was adapted by nature.</P>
<P>Such was the court when ZOILUS arriv'd; but be∣fore he enter'd Alexandria, he spent a night in the temple of Isis, to enquire of the success of his under∣taking; not that he doubted the worth of his works,
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>but his late misfortune had instructed him, that others might be ignorant of it. Having therefore perform'd the accustom'd sacrifice, and compos'd himself to rest upon the hide, he had a vision which foretold of his future fame.</P>
<P>He found himself sitting under the shade of a dark yew, which was cover'd with hellebore and hemlock, and near the mouth of a cave, where sat a monster, pale, wasted, surrounded with snakes, fost'ring a cocka∣trice in her bosom; and cursing the sun, for making the work of the deities appear in its beauty. The sight of this bred fear in him; when she subddenly turn∣ing her sunk eyes, put on a hideous kind of a loving grin, in which he discover'd a resemblance to some of his own features. Then turning up her snakes, and interlacing them in the form of a turbant, to give him less disgust, thus she address'd herself: <Q>Go on, my son, in whom I am renew'd, and prosper in thy brave undertakings on mankind: assert their wit to be dulness; prove their sense to be folly; know truth only when it is on thy own side; and acknow∣ledge learning at no other time to be useful. Spare not an author of any rank or size; let not thy tongue or pen know pity; make the living feel thy accusa∣tions; make the ghosts of the dead groan in their tombs for their violated fame. But why do I spend time in needless advice, which may be better used in encouragement? Let thy eyes delight themselves with
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>the future recompence which I have reserv'd for thy merit.</Q> Thus spoke the monster, and shriek'd the name of ZOILUS: the shades, who were to bear the same name after him, became obedient; and the mouth of the cave was fill'd with strange supercilious counte∣nances, which all crowded to make their appearance. These began to march before him with an imitation of his mien and manners: some crowned with wild sor∣rel, others having leaves of dead bays mingled amongst it; whilst the monster still describ'd them as he pass'd, and touch'd each with a livid track of malignant light, that shot from her eye, to point where she meant the description. <Q>They (says she) in the chaplets of wild sorrel, are my writers of prose, who erect scandal into criticism: they who wear the wither'd bay with it, are such who write poems, which are professed∣ly to answer all rules, and be left for patterns to men of genius. These that follow shall attack others, because they are excell'd by them. The next rank shall make an author's being read, a sufficient ground of opposition. Here march my grammarians, skill'd to torture words; there my sons of sophistry, ever ready to wrest a meaning. Observe how faint the foremost of the procession appear; and how they are now lost in yonder mists, which roll about the cave of oblivion! this shews, it is not for them∣selves that they are to be known; the world will consider them only as managing a part of thy en∣dowments,
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>and so know them by thy name while they live, that their own shall be lost for ever. But see how my cave still swarms! how every age pro∣duces men, upon whom the preservation of thy me∣mory devolves. My darling, the fates have decreed it! thou art ZOILUS, and ZOILUS shall be eternal. Come, my serpents, applaud him with your hisses, that is all which now can be done; in modern times, my sons shall invent louder instruments, and artificial imitations; noises which drown the voice of merit, shall furnish a concert to delight them.</Q> Here she arose to clasp him in her arms, a strange noise was heard, the critic started at it, and his vision for∣sook him.</P>
<P>It was with some confusion, that he lay musing a while upon what he had seen; but reflecting, that the Goddess had given him no answer concerning his suc∣cess in Egypt, he strengthen'd his heart in his ancient self-love and enmity to others, and took all for an idle dream born of the fumes of indigestion, or produc'd by the dizzy motion of his voyage. In this opinion, he told it at his departure to the priest, who admiring the extraordinary relation, registred it in hieroglyphics at Canopus.</P>
<P>The day when he came to Alexandria was one on which the king had appointed games to APOLLO and the MUSES, and honours and rewards for such writers as shou'd appear in them. This he took for a happy
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>omen at his entrance, and, not to lose an opportunity of shewing himself, repair'd immediately to the public theatre; where, as if every thing was to favour him, the very first accident gave his spleen a diversion, which we find at large in the proem of the seventh book of VITRUVIUS. It happen'd that when the poets had re∣cited, six of the judges decreed the prizes with a full ap∣probation of all the audience. From this, Aristopha∣nes alone dissented, and demanded the first prize for a person whose bashful and interrupted manner of speaking made him appear the most disgustful: for he (says the judge) is alone a poet, and all the rest re∣citers; and they who are judges, shou'd not approve thefts, but writings. To maintain his assertion, those volumes were produc'd from whence they had been stoll'n: upon which, the king order'd them to be for∣mally try'd for theft, and dismiss'd with infamy; but placed Aristophanes over his library, as one, who had given a proof of his knowledge in books. This pas∣sage ZOILUS often afterwards repeated with pleasure, for the number of disgraces which happen'd in it to the pretenders in poetry; tho' his envy made him still careful not to name Aristophanes, but a judge in ge∣neral.</P>
<P>However, criticism had only a short triumph over poetry, when he made the next turn his own, by step∣ping forward into the place of reciting. Here he im∣mediately rais'd the curiosity, and drew the attention
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>of both king and people: but, as it happen'd, neither the one nor the other lasted; for the first sentence where he had registred his own name, satisfied their cu∣riosity; and the next, where he offer'd to prove to a court so devoted to HOMER, that he was ridiculous in every thing; went near to finish his audience. He was nevertheless heard quietly for some time, till the king seeing no end of his abusing the prince of philological learning, (as Vitruvius words it) departed in disdain. The judges follow'd, deriding his attempt as an ex∣travagance which cou'd not demand their gravity; and the people taking a licence from the precedent, hooted him away with obloquy and indignation. Thus ZOILUS fail'd at his first appearance, and was forc'd to retire, stung with a most impatient sense of public contempt.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding all this, he did not omit his attendance at court on the day following, with a peti∣tion that he might be put upon the establishment of learning, and allow'd a pension. This the king read, but return'd no answer: so great was the scorn he conceiv'd against him. But ZOILUS still undauntedly renew'd his petitions, 'till PTOLEMY, being weary of his persecution, gave him a flat denial. HOMER, (says the prince) who has been dead these thousand years, has maintain'd thousands of people; and ZOILUS, who boasts he has more wit than he, ought not only to maintain himself, but many others also.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169"/>His petitions being thrown carelesly about, were fall'n into the hands of men of wit, whom, according to his custom, he had provok'd, and whom it is unsafe to provoke if you wou'd live unexpos'd. I can com∣pare them to nothing more properly, than to the Bee, a creature wing'd and lively, fond to rove through the choicest flowers of nature, and blest at home among the sweets of its own composition: not ill-natur'd, yet quick to revenge an injury; not wearing its sting out of the sheath; yet able to wound more sorely than its appearance would threaten. Now these being made personal enemies by his malicious expressions, the court rung with petitions of ZOILUS transvers'd; new peti∣tions drawn up for him; catalogues of his merits, sup∣pos'd to be collected by himself; his complaints of man's injustice set to a harp out of tune, and a hundred other sports of fancy, with which their epigrams play'd upon him. These were the ways of writing which ZOILUS hated, because they were not only read, but retain'd easily, by reason of their spirit, humour, and brevity; and because they not only make the man a jest upon whom they are written, but a farther jest, if he attempt to answer them gravely. However, he did what he cou'd in revenge, he endeavour'd to set those whom he envy'd at variance among themselves, and invented lyes to promote his design. He told Eratos∣thenes, that Callimachus said, his extent of learning consisted but in a superficial knowledge of the sciences;
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>and whisper'd Callimachus, that Eratosthenes only al∣low'd him to have an artful habitual knack of versify∣ing. He would have made Aristophanes believe, that Theocritus rally'd his knowledge in editions, as a cu∣rious kind of trifling; and Theocritus, that Aristo∣phanes derided the rustical simplicity of his shepherds. Tho' of all his stories, that which be most valu'd him∣self for, was his constant report, that every one whom he hated was a friend to ANTIOCHUS king of Syria, the enemy of PTOLEMY.</P>
<P>But malice is unsuccessful when the character of its agent is known: they grew more friends to one ano∣ther, by imagining, that even what had been said, as well as what had not, was all of ZOILUS'S invention; and as he grew more and more the common jest, their derision of him became a kind of life and cement to their conversation.</P>
<P>Contempt, poverty, and other misfortunes had now so assaulted him, that even they who abhorr'd his tem∣per, contributed something to his support, in common humanity. Yet still his envy, like a vitiated stomach, converted every kindness to the nourishment of his dis∣ease; and 'twas the whole business of his life to revile HOMER, and those by whom he himself subsisted. In this humour he had days, which were so given up to impatient ill-nature, that he could neither write any thing, nor converse with anyone. These he sometimes employ'd in throwing stones at children; which was
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>once so unhappily return'd upon him, that he was ta∣ken up for dead: and this occasion'd the report in some authors, of his being stoned to death in Egypt. Or, sometimes he convey'd himself into the library, where he blotted the name of HOMER wherever he could meet it, and tore the best editions of several volumes; for which the librarians debarr'd him the privilege of that place. These and other mischiefs made him universal∣ly shunn'd; nay, to such an extravagance was his cha∣racter of envy carry'd, that the more superstitious E∣gyptians imagin'd they were fascinated by him, if the day were darker, or themselves a little heavier than ordinary; some wore sprigs of rue, by way of preven∣tion; and others, rings made of the hoof of a wild ass for amulets, lest they should suffer, by his fixing an eye upon them.</P>
<P>It was now near the time, when that splendid temple which PTOLEMY built in honour of HOMER, was to be open'd with a solemn magnificence: for this the men of genius were employ'd in finding a proper pageant. At last, they agreed by one consent, to have ZOILUS, the utter enemy of HOMER, hang'd in effigy; and the day being come, it was on this manner they form'd the procession. Twelve beautiful boys, lightly habited in white, with purple wings representing the HOURS, went on the foremost: after these, came a chariot ex∣ceeding high and stately, where sat one representing APOLLO; with another at his feet, who in thig pomp
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>sustain'd the person of HOMER: Apollo's laurel had little gilded points, like the appearance of rays between its leaves; HOMER's was bound with a blue sillet, like that which is worn by the priests of the Deity: Apollo was distinguish'd by the golden harp he bore; Homer, by a volume, richly beautify'd with horns of inlaid ivo∣ry, and tassels of silver depending from them. Behind these came three chariots, in which rode nine damsels, each of them with that instrument which is proper to each of the Muses; among whom, CALLIOPE, to give her the honour of the day, sate in the middle of the second chariot, known by her richer vestments. Af∣ter these march'd a solemn train aptly habited, like those sciences which acknowledge their rise or improve∣ment from this Poet. Then the men of learning who attended the court, with wreaths, and rods or scepters of laurel, as taking upon themselves the representation of Rhapsodists, to do honour, for the time, to HOMER. In the rear of all was slowly drawn along an odd car∣riage, rather than a chariot, which had its sides art∣fully turn'd, and carv'd so as to bear a resemblance to the heads of snarling mastiffs. In this was borne, as led in triumph, a tall image of deformity, whose head was bald, and wound about with nettles for a chaplet. The tongue lay lolling out, to shew a contempt of man∣kind, and was fork'd at the end, to confess its love to detraction. The hands were manacled behind, and the fingers arm'd with long nails, to cut deep through
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>the margins of authors. Its vesture was of the paper of Nilus, bearing inscrib'd upon its breast in capital letters, ZOILUS THE HOMERO-MASTIX; and all the rest of it was scrawl'd with various monsters of that river, as emblems of those productions with which that critic us'd to fill his papers. When they had reach'd the temple, where the king and his court were already plac'd to behold them from its galleries, the image of ZOILUS was hung upon a gibbet, there erected for it, with such loud acclamations as witness'd the people's satisfaction. This being finish'd, the HOURS knock'd at the gates; which flew open, and discover'd the statue of HOMER magnificently seated, with the pictures of those cities which contended for his birth, rang'd in order around him. Then they who represented the Deities in the procession, laying aside their ensigns of divinity, usher'd in the men of learning with a sound of voices, and their various instruments, to assist at a sacrifice in honour of APOLLO and his favourite HOMER.</P>
<P>It may be easily believ'd, that ZOILUS concluded his affairs were at the utmost point of desperation in Egypt; wherefore, fill'd with pride, scorn, anger, vexa∣tion, envy, (and whatever cou'd torment him) except the knowledge of his unworthiness) he flung himself a∣board the first ship which left that country. As it hap∣pen'd, the vessel he sail'd in was bound for Asia Minor, and this landing him at a port the nearest to Smyrna, he was à little pleas'd amidst his misery to think of de∣crying
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>HOMER in another place where he was ador'd, and which chiefly pretended to his birth. So incorri∣gible was his disposition; that no experience taught him anything which might contribute to his ease and safety.</P>
<P>And as his experience wrought nothing on him, so neither did the accidents, which the opinion of those times took for ominous warnings: for, he is reported to have seen, the night he came to Smyrna, a venerable person, such as HOMER is described by antiquity, threatning him in a dream; and in the morning he found a part of his works gnaw'd by Mice, which, says Aelian, are of all beasts the most prophetic; insomuch. that they know when to leave a house, even before its fall is suspected. Envy, which has no relaxation, still hurry'd him forward; for it is certainly true that a man has not firmer resolution from reason, to stand by a good principle, than obstinacy from perverted nature, to adhere to a bad one.</P>
<P>In the morning as he walk'd the street, he observ'd in some plates inscriptions concerning HOMER, which inform'd him where he liv'd, where he had taught school, and several other particularities which the Smyr∣neans glory to have recorded of him; all which awa∣ken'd and irritated the passions of ZOILUS. But hit temper was quite overthrown, by the venerable ap∣pearance which he saw, upon entring the Homereum: which is a building compos'd of a library, porch, and temple erected to HOMER. Here a phrenzy seited him
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>which knew no bounds; he rav'd violently against the Poet, and all his admirers; he trampled on his works, he spurn'd about his commentators, he tore down his busts from the niches, threw the medals that were cast of him out of the windows, and passing from one place to another, beat the aged priests, and broke down the altar. The cries which were occasioned by this means brought in many upon him; who observ'd with horror how the most sacred honours of their city were pro∣phan'd by the frantic impiety of a stranger; and im∣mediately dragg'd him to punishment before their ma∣gistrates, who were then sitting. He was no sooner there, but known for ZOILUS by some in court, a name a long time most hateful to Smyrna; which, as it valu'd itself upon the birth of HOMER, so bore more impatiently than other places, the abuses offer'd him. This made them eager to propitiate his shade, and claim to themselves a second merit by the death of ZOILUS; wherefore they sentenc'd him to suller by fire, as the due reward of his desecrations; and order'd, that their city shou'd be purify'd by a lustration, for having entertain'd so impious a guest. In pursuance to this sentence, he was led away with his composi∣tions born before him by the public executioner: then was he fasten'd to the stake, prophesying all the while how many shou'd arise to revenge his quarrel; parti∣cularly, that when Greek shou'd be no more a lan∣guage, there shall be a Nation which will both trans∣late
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>HOMER into Prose, and contract him in Verse. At last, his compositions were lighted to set the pile on fire, and he expir'd sighing for the loss of them, more than for the pain he suffer'd: and perhaps too, be∣cause he might foresee in his prophetic rapture, that there shou'd arise a poet in another nation, able to do HOMER justice, and make him known amongst his people to future ages.</P>
<P>Thus dy'd this noted critic, of whom we may ob∣serve from the course of the history, that as several ci∣ties contended for the honour of the birth of HOMER, so several have contended for the honour of the death of ZOILUS. With him likewise perish'd his great work on the ILIAD, and the ODYSSE; concerning which we observe also, that as the known worth of HOMER'S poetry makes him survive himself with glory; so the bare memory of ZOILUS'S criticism makes him sur∣vive himself with infamy. These are deservedly the consequences of that Ill-nature which made him fond of detraction; that Envy, which made him choose so excellent a character for its object; and those partial Methods of Injustice, with which he treated the object he had chosen.</P>
<P>Yet how many commence critics after him, upon the same unhappy principles? How many labour to destroy the monuments of the dead, and summon up the great from their graves to answer for trifles before them? how many, by misrepresentations, both hinder the world
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>from favouring men of genius, and discourage them in themselves; like boughs of a baneful and barren nature, that shoot a-cross a fruit-tree; at once to screen the sun from it, and hinder it by their droppings from producing any thing of value? but if these who thus follow ZOILUS, meet not the same severities of fate, because they come short of his indefatigableness, or their object is not so universally the concern of man∣kind; they shall nevertheless meet a proportion of it in the inward trouble they give themselves, and the outward contempt others fling upon them: a punish∣ment which every one has hitherto felt, who has real∣ly deserv'd to be call'd a ZOILUS; and which will al∣ways be the natural reward of such mens actions, as long as ZOILUS is the proper name of Envy.</P>

<HEAD>ZOILUS's REMARKS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Ingenium magni livor detrectat amici,</L>
<L>Quisquis et ex illo, Zoile, nomen habes.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I MUST do my Reader the justice, before I enter upon these NOTES of ZOILUS, to inform him, that I have not in any author met this work ascrib'd to him by its title, which has made me not mention it in the LIFE. But thus much in general appears, that he wrote several things besides his censure on the ILIAD, which, as it gives ground for this opinion, encourages me to offer an account of the Treatise.</P>
<P>Being acquainted with a grave gentleman who searches after Editions, purchases Manuscripts, and collects Copies, I apply'd to him for some Editions of this Poem, which he readily oblig'd me with. But, ad∣ded he, taking down a paper, I doubt I shall discou∣rage you from your translation, when I show this work, which is written upon the original, by ZOILUS, the famous adversary of HOMER. ZOILUS! said I with
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>surprize; I thought his works had long since perish'd. They have so, answer'd he, all, except this little Piece, which has a PREFACE annex'd to it accounting for its preservation. It seems, when he parted from Macedon, he left this behind him where he lodg'd, and where no one enter'd for a long time, in detestation of the odi∣ousness of his character, 'till Maevius arriving there in his travels, and being desirous to lie in the same room, luckily found it, and brought it away with him. This the author of the PREFACE imagines the reason of Ho∣race's wishing Maevius, in the 10th EPODE, such a shipwreck as HOMER describes; as it were with an eye to his having done something disadvantageous to that Poet. From Maevius, the piece came into the hand of Carbilius Pictor, (who, when he wrote against Virgil, call'd his book, with a respectful imitation of ZOILUS, the AENEIDOMASTIX) and from him into the hands of others who are unknown, because the world apply'd to them no other name than that of ZOILUS, in order to sink their own in oblivion. Thus it ever found some learned philologist or critic, to keep it secret from the rage of HOMER's admirers; yet not so secret, but that it has still been communicated among the LITERATI. I am of opinion, that our great SCALIGER borrow'd it, to work him up when he writ so sharply against Cardan; and perhaps Le Clerc too, when he prov'd Q. Curtius ignorant of every particular branch of learning.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180"/>This formal account made me give attention to what the book contain'd; and I must acknowledge, that whether it be his, or the work of some gramma∣rian, it appears to be writ in his spirit. The open pro∣fession of enmity to great genius's, and the fear of no∣thing so much as that he may not be able to find faults enough, are such resemblances of his strongest features, that any one might take it for his own production. To give the world a notion of this, I have made a collection of some REMARKS, which most struck me, during that short time in which I was allow'd to per∣use the Manuscript.</P>

<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
<HEAD>THE REMARKS OF ZOILUS UPON HOMER'S BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE.</HEAD>
<P>Pag. 43. Ver, 1.</P>
<P>TO FILL MY RISING SONG.] <Q>As Protagoras the sophist found fault with the beginning of the ILIAD, for its speaking to the Muse rather with an abrupt command, than a solemn invocation; so I, says ZOILUs, doon the other hand find fault with him for using any invocation at all before this poem, or any such trifles as he is the author of If he must use one, Protagoras is in the right; if not, I am: this I hold for true criticism, notwithstanding the opinion of Aristotle against us. Nor let any one lay
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>a stress on Aristotle in this point; he alas ! knows nothing of Poetry but what he has read in HOMER; his rules are all extracted from him, or founded in him. In short, HOMER'S works are the examples of Aristotle's precepts; and Aristotle's precepts the methods HOMER wrought by.</Q> From hence it is to be concluded as the opinion of this Critic, that who∣ever wou'd entirely destroy the reputation of HOMER, must renounce the authority of Aristotle before-hand. The rules of building may be of service to us, if we design to judge of an edifice, and discover what may be amiss in it for the advantage of future artificers; but they are of no use to those who only intend to o∣verthrow it utterly.</P>
<P>After the word [SONG,] in the first line the ori∣ginal adds, [WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN MY TA∣BLETS.] These words, which are dropp'd in the trans∣lation as of no consequence, the great ZOILUS has thought fit to expunge; asserting for a reason, with∣out backing it with farther proof, <Q>That tablets were it not of fo early invention.</Q> Now, it must be grant∣ed, this manner of proving by affirmation is of an ex∣traordinary nature; but however it has its end with a set of readers for whom it is adapted. One part of the world knows not with what assurance another part can express itself. They imagine a reasonable creature will not have the face to say any thing which has not some shadow of reason to support it; and run impli∣citly
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>into the snare which is laid for good-nature, by these daring authors of definitive sentences upon bare assertion.</P>
<P>Pag. 43. Ver. 15. WHOM CATS PURSU'D.] The Greek word here expresly signifies a Cat: ZOILUS, whom Perizonius follows, affirms, <Q>It was Weezels which the Mouse fled from;</Q> and then objects a∣gainst its probability. But it is common with one sort of Critics, to shew an author means differently from what he really did; and then to prove, that the mean∣ing which they find out for him is good for nothing.</P>
<P>Pag. 44. Ver. 7. IF WORTHY FRIENDSHIP.] In this proposal begins the moral of the whole piece, which is, that hasty, ill-founded, or unnatural friend∣ships and leagues, will naturally end in war and dis∣cord. But ZOILUS, who is here mightily concern'd to take off from HOMER all the honour of having design'd a moral, asserts on the other hand, <Q>That the Poet's whole intent was to make a Fable; that a Fable he has made, and one very idle and trifling; that many things are ascrib'd to HOMER, which poor HOMER never dream'd of; and he who finds them out, ra∣ther shews his own parts than discovers his author's beauties.</Q> In this opinion has he been follow'd by several of those Critics, who only dip into authors when they have occasion to write against them: and yet even these shall speak differently concerning the writers, if the question be of their own performances;
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>for to their own works they write Prefaces, to dis∣play the grandness of the moral, regularity of the scheme, number and brightness of the figures, and a thousand other excellencies, which if they did not tell, no one wou'd ever imagine. For others, they write Remarks, which tend to contract their excellencies within the narrow compass of their partial appre∣hesion. It were well if they cou'd allow such to be as wise as themselves, whom the world allows to be much wiser; but their being naturally friends to themselves, and professedly adversaries to some greater genius, easily accounts for these different man∣ners of speaking. I will not leave this note, without giving you an instance of its practice in the great JU∣LIUS SCALIGER: he has been free enough with HO∣MER in the Remarks he makes upon him; but when he speaks of himself, I desire my reader wou'd take no∣tice of his modesty; I give his own words, Lib. 3. Poet. Cap. 112. <Q>In Deum Patrem Hymnum cum scriberemus, tanquam rerum omnium conditorem, ab orbis ipsius creatione ad nos nostraque usque duxi∣mus. —In quo abduximus animum nostrum a cor∣poris carcere ad liberos campos contemplationis, quae me in illum transformaret. Tum autem sanc∣tissimi Spiritus ineffabilis vigor ille canto ardore ce∣lebratus est, ut cum lenissimis numeris esset inchoa∣tus Hymnus, repentino divini Ignis impetu consla∣gravit.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="185"/>Pag. 45. Ver. 7. THE CIRCLED LOAVES.] <Q>ZOI∣LUS here finds fault with the mention of loaves, tripes, bacon and cheese, as words below the dig∣nity of the EPIC, as much (says he) as it wou'd be to have opprobrious names given in it.</Q> By which expression we easily see, he hints at the first book of the ILIAD. Now, we must consider in answer, that it is a Mouse which is spoken of, that eating is the most appearing chatacteristic of that creature, that these foods are such as please it most; and to have de∣scrib'd particular pleasures for it in any other way, wou'd have been as incongruous, as to have describ'd a haughty loud anger without those names which it throws out in its fierceness, and which raise it to its pitch of phrenzy. In the one instance you still see a Mouse before you, however the Poet raises it to a man; in the other, you shall see a man before you; however, the Poet raises him to a Demi-God. But some call that LOW, which others call NATURAL. Every thing has two handles, and the critic who sets himself to cen∣sure all he meets, is under an obligation still to lay hold on the worst of them.</P>
<P>Pag. 46. Ver. 1. BUT ME, NOR STALKS.] In this place ZOILUS <Q>laughs at the ridiculousness of the Poet, who (according to his representation) makes a prince refuse an invitation in heroics, because he did not like the meat he was invited to.</Q> And, that the ridicule may appear in as strong a light to others
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>as to himself, he puts as much of the speech as con∣cerns it into burlesque airs, and expressions. This is indeed a common trick with Remarkers, which they either practise by precedent from their master ZOILUS, or are beholden for it to the same turn of temper. We acknowledge it a fine piece of satire, when there is folly in a passage, to lay it open in the way by which it naturally requires to be expos'd: do this hand∣somely, and the author is deservedly a jest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, on the contrary, you dress a passage which was not original∣ly foolish, in the highest humour of ridicule, you only frame something which the author himself might laugh at, without being more nearly concerned than another render.</P>
<P>Pag. 47. Ver. 1. SO PASS'D EUROPA] This si∣mile makes ZOILUS, who sets up for a profess'd enemy of Fables, to exclaim violently. <Q>We had, says he, a Frog and a Mouse hitherto, and now we get a Bull and a Princess to illustrate their actions: when will there be an end of this Fabling-folly and Poetry, which I value myself for being unacquainted with? O great POLYCRATES, how happily hast thou ob∣serv?d in thy accusation against SOCRATES, That whatever he was before, he deserv'd his poison when he began to make verses!</Q> Now, if the question be concerning HOMER'S good or bad Poetry, this is an unqualifying speech, which affords his friends just grounds of exception against the Critic. Wherefore
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>be it known to all present and future Cenfors, who haver, or shall presume to glory, in an ignorance of Poetry, and at the same time take upon them to judge of Poets, that they are in all their degrees for evere ex∣cluded the post they would usurp. In the first place, they who know neither the use, nor practice of the art; in the second, they who know, it but by halves, Who have hearts insensible of the beauties of Poetry, and are however able to find fault by rules; and thirdly, they who, when they are capable of perceiv∣ing beauties and pointing out defects, are still so igno∣rant in the nature of their business, as to imagine the province of Criticism extends itself only on the side of dispraise and reprehension. How cou'd any one at this rate be seen with his proper balance of perfection and error? or what were the best performances in this in∣dulgence of ill-nature, but as apartments hung with the deformities of humanity, done by some great hand, which are the more to be abhorr'd, because the praise and honour they receive, results from the degree of uneasiness, to which they put every temper of com∣mon goodness?</P>
<P>Pag. 47. Ver. 28. YE MICE, YE MICE.] The an∣cients believ'd that heroes were turn'd into Demi-Gods at their death; and in general, that departing fouls have something of a sight into futurity. It is ei∣ther this notion, or a care which the Gods may take to abate the pride of insulting adversaries, which a
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>Poet goes upon, when he makes his leaders die fore∣telling the end of those by whom they are slain. ZOI∣LUS however is against this passage. He says, <Q>That every character ought to be strictly kept; that a ge∣neral ought not to invade the character of a prophet, nor a prophet of a general.</Q> He is positive, <Q>that nothing shou'd be done by any one, without having been hinted at in some previous account of him.</Q> And this he asserts, without any allowance made either for a change of states, or the design of the Gods. To confirm this observation, he strengthens it with a quo∣tation out of his larger work on the ILIAD, where he has these words upon the death of HECTOR: <Q>How foolish is it in HOMER to make HECTOR (who thro' the whole course of the ILIAD had made use of HE∣LENUS, to learn the will of the Gods) becomes pro∣phet just at his death? Let every one be what he ought, without falling into those parts which others are to sustain in a poem.</Q> This he has said, not di∣stinguishing rightly between our natural dispostions and accidental offices. And this he has said again, not minding, that tho' it be taken from another book, it is still from the same author. However, vanity loves to gratify itself by the repetition of what it esteems, to be written with spirit, and even when we repeat it our∣selves, provided another hears us. Hence has he been follow'd by a magisterial set of men who quote them∣selves, and swell their new perfomances with what
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>they admire in their former Treatises. This is a most extraordinary knack of arguing, whereby a man can never want a proof, if he be allow'd to become an au∣thority for his own opinion.</P>
<P>Pag. 48. Ver. 16. AND NO KIND BILLOW.] <Q>How impertinent is this case of pity, says ZOILUS, to be∣moan, that the prince was not toss'd towards land: It is enough he lost his life, and there is an end of his suffering where there is an end of his feeling. To carry the matter farther, is just the same foolish management as HOMER has shewn in his ILIADS, which he spins out into forty trifles beyond the death of HECTOR.</Q> But the Critic must allow me to put the renders in mind, that death was not the last distress the Ancients believ'd was to be met upon earth. The last was the remaining unbury'd, which had this misery an∣nex'd, that while the body was without its funeral-rites in this world, the soul was suppos'd to be without rest in the next. which was the case of the Mouse be∣fore us. And accordingly the AJAX of SOPHOCLES continues after the death of its hero more than an act, upon the contest concerning his burial. All this ZOI∣LUS knew very well: but ZOILUS is not the only one, who disputes for victory rather than truth. These foolish, to shew how much they can write against an author. They act unfairly, that they may be sure to be sharp enough; and trifle with the reader, in order
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>to be voluminous. It is needless to wish them the re∣turn they deserve: their disregard to candour is no sooner discover'd, but they are for ever banish'd from the eyes of men of sense, and condemn'd to wander from stall to stall, for a temporary refuge from that oblivion which they can't escape.</P>
<P>Pag. 49. Ver. 1. OUR ELDEST PERISH'D.] ZOI∣LUS had here taken <Q>the recapitulation of those mis∣fortunes which happen'd to the Royal Family, as an impertinence that expatiates from the subject;</Q> tho' indeed there seems nothing more proper to raise that sort of compassion, which was to inslame his audience to war. But what appears extremely pleasant is, that at the same time he condemns the passage, he shou'd make use of it as an opportunity, to fall into <Q>an ample digression on the various kinds of Mouse∣traps,</Q> and display that minute learning which e∣very Critic of his sort is fond to shew himself master of. This they imagine is tracing of knowledge thro' its hidden veins, and bringing discoveries to day∣light, which time had cover'd over. Indefatigable and useless mortals! who value themselves for knowledge of no consequence, and think of gaining applause by what the reader is careful to pass over unread. What did the disquisition signify formerly, whether Ulysses's Son, or his Dog, was the elder? or how can the ac∣count of a Vesture, or a Player's Masque, deserve that any shou'd write the bulk of a treatise, or others read
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>it when it is written? A vanity, thus poorly support∣ed, which neither affords pleasure nor profit, is the un∣substantial amusement of a dream to ourselves, and a provoking occasion of our derision to others.</P>
<P>Pag. 49. Ver. 15, 16. QUILLS APTLY BOUND—FAC'D WITH THE PLUNDER OF A CAT THEY FLAY'D.] This passage is something difficult in the original, which gave ZOILUS the opportunity of inventing an expression, which his followers conceitedly use when any thing appears dark to them. <Q>This, say they, let Phoebus explain;</Q> as if what exceeds their capa∣city must of necessity demand oracular interpretations, and an interposal of the God of Wit and Learning. The basis of such arrogance is the opinion they have of that knowledge they ascribe to themselves. They take Criticism to be beyond every other part of learn∣ing, because it gives judgment upon books written in every other part. They think in consequence, that every Critic must be a greater Genius than any Au∣thor whom he censures; and therefore if they esteem themselves Critics, they set enthron'd Infancy at the head of Literature. Criticism indeed deserves a noble Elogy, when it is enlarg'd by such a comprehensive learning as Aristotle and Cicero were masters of; when it adorns its precepts with the consummate exactness of Quintilian, or is exalted into the sublime sentiments of Longinus. But let not such men tell us they parti∣cipate in the glory of these great men, and place them∣selves
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>next to PHOEBUS, who, like ZOILUS, entangle an author in the wrangles of grammarians, or try him with a positive air and barren imagination, by the set of rules they have collected out of others.</P>
<P>Pag. 50. Ver. 1. YE FROGS! THE MICE.] At this speech of the Herald's, which recites the cause of the war, ZOILUS is angry with the Author, <Q>for not finding out a cause entirely just; for, says he, it appears not from his own Fable, that Physignathus invited the prince with any malicious intention to make him away.</Q> To this we answer, 1st, That it is not necessary in relating facts to make every war have a just beginning. 2dly, This doubtful cause a∣grees better with the moral, by shewing that ill-found∣ed leagues have accidents to destroy them, even with∣out the intention of parties. 3dly, There was all ap∣pearance imaginable against the frogs; and if we may be allow'd to retort on our adversary the practice of his posterity, there is more humanity in an hostility pro∣claim'd upon the appearance of injustice done us, than in their custom of attacking the works of others as soon as they come out, purely because they are esteem'd to be good. Their performances, which cou'd derive no merit from their own names, are then sold upon the merit of their antagonist: and if they are so sen∣sible of fame, or even of envy, they have the morti∣fication to remember, how much by this means they be∣come indebted to those they injure.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193"/>Pag. 50. Ver. 21. WHERE HIGH THE BANKS.] This project is not put in practice during the follow∣ing battle, by reason of the fury of the combatants: yet the mention of it is not impertinent in this place, forasmuch as the probable face of success which it car∣ties with it tended to animate the Frogs. ZOILUS however cannot be so satisfied; <Q>It were better, says he, to cut it intirely out; nor won'd HOMER be the worse if half of him were serv'd in the same man∣ner; so, continues he, they will find it, whoever in any country, shall hereafter undertake so odd a task, as that of translating him.</Q> Thus Envy finds words to put in the mouth of Ignorance; and the time will come, when Ignorance shall repeat what Envy has pronounced so rashly.</P>
<P>Pag. 51. Ver. 13. AND TAP'RING SEA-REEDS.] If we here take the reed for that of our own growth, it is no spear to match the long sort of needles with which the Mice had arm'd themselves; but the cane, which is rather intended, has its splinters stiff and sharp, to answer all the uses of a spear in battle. Nor is it here to be lightly past over, since ZOILUS moves a question upon it, that the Poet cou'd not choose a more proper weapon for the Frogs, than that which they choose for themselves in a defensive war they maintain with the serpents of Nile. <Q>They have this stratagem, says Aelian, to protect themselves; they swim with pieces of cane across their mouths, of too great a length
<PB N="193" REF="194"/>for the breadth of the serpents throats; by which means they are preserv'd from being swallow'd by them.</Q> This is a quotation so much to the point, that I ought to have usher'd in my Author with more pomp to dazzle the reader. ZOILUS and his follow∣ers, who seldom praise any man, are however careful to do it for their own sakes, if at any time they get an author of their opinion: tho' indeed it must be al∣low'd, they still have a draw-back in their manner of praise, and rather choose to drop the name of their man, or darkly hint him in a periphrasis, than to have it ap∣pear that they have directly assisted the perpetuating of any one's memory. Thus, if a Dutch Critic were to introduce for example MARTIAL, he would, instead of naming him, say, INGENIOSUS ILLE EPIGRAMMATI∣CUS BILBILICUS. Or, if one of our own were to quote from among ourselves, he wou'd tell us how it has been remark'd <Q>in the works of a learned Writer, to whom the world is obliged for many excellent productions,</Q> etc. All which proceeding is like boasting of our great friends, when it is to do ourselves an honour, or the shift of dressing up one who might otherwise be disregarded, to make him pass upon the world for a responsible voucher to our own assertions.</P>
<P>Pag. 51. Ver. 17. BUT NOW WHERE JOVE'S.] At this fine Episode, in which the Gods are introduced, ZOILUS has no patience left him to remark; but runs some lines with a long string of such expressions, as
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>"Trifler, Fabler, Lyar, foolish, impious," all which he lavishly heaps upon the Poet. From this knack of calling names, join'd with the several arts of finding fault, it is to be suspected, that our ZOILUS'S might make very able libellers, and dangerous men to the government, if they did not rather turn themselves to be ridiculous censors: for which reason I cannot but reckon the state oblig'd to men of wit; and under a kind of debt in gratitude, when they take off so much spleen, turbulency, and ill-nature, as might otherwise spend itself to the detriment of the public.</P>
<P>Pag. 52. Ver. 5. IF MY DAUGHTER'S MIND.] This speech, which Jupiter speaks to Pallas with a pleasant kind of air, ZOILUS takes gravely to pieces; and affirms, <Q>It is below Jupiter's wisdom, and on∣ly agreeable with HOMER'S folly, that he shou'd bor∣row a reason for her assisting the Mice from their at∣tendance in the temple, when they waited to prey upon those things which were sacred to her.</Q> But the air of the speech rendering a grave answer unne∣cessary; I shall only offer ZOILUS an observation in return for his. There are upon the stone which is carv'd for the apotheosis of HOMER, figures of Mice by his footstool, which, according to Cuperus, its interpre∣ter, some have taken to signify this Poem; and others those Critics, who tear or vilify the works of great men. Now if such can be compar'd to Mice, let the words of ZOILUS be brought home to himself and his fol∣lowers
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>for their mortification. <Q>That no one ought to think of meriting in the state of learning only by de∣basing the best performances, and as it were prey∣ing upon those things which shou'd be sacred in it.</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 52. Ver. 13. IN VAIN MY FATHER.] The speech of Pallas is dislik'd by ZOILUS, <Q>because it makes the Goddess carry a resentment against such inconsiderable creatures;</Q> tho' he ought to esteem them otherwise when they represent the persons and actions of men, and teach us how the Gods, disregard those in their adversities who provoke them in prospe∣rity. But, if we consider Pallas as the patroness of learn∣ing, we may by an allegorical application of the Mice and Frogs, find in this speech two sorts of enemies to learning; they who are maliciously mischievous, as the Mice; and they who are turbulent through ostentation, as the Frogs. The first are enemies to excellency up∣on principle; the second accidentally by the error of self-love, which does not quarrel with the excellence itself, but only with those people who get more praise than themselves by it. Thus, tho' they have not the same perverseness with the others, they are however drawn into the same practices, while they ruin reputa∣tions, lest they shou'd not seem to be learn'd; as some women turn prostitutes, lest they shou'd not be thought handsome enough to have admirers.</P>
<P>Pag. 54. Ver. 5. THEIR DREADFUL TRUMPETS.] Upon the reading of this, ZOILUS becomes full of dis∣coveries.
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>He recollects, <Q>that Homer makes his Greeks come to battle with silence, and his Trojans with shouts;</Q> from whence he discovers, <Q>that he knew nothing of trumpets.</Q> Again, he sees, <Q>that the hornet is made a trumpeter to the battle;</Q> and hence he discovers, <Q>that the line must not be HO∣MER'S.</Q> Now had he drawn his consequences fair∣ly, he cou'd only have found by the one, that trum∣pets were not in use at the taking of Troy; and by the other, that the battle of Frogs and Mice was laid by the Poet for a later scene of action than that of the ILIAD. But the boast of discoveries accompanies the affectation of knowledge; and the affectation of know∣ledge is taken up with a design to gain a command o∣ver the opinions of others. It is too heavy a task for some Critics to sway our rational judgments by ratio∣nal inferences; a pompous pretence must occasion ad∣miration, the eyes of mankind must be obscur'd by a glare of pedantry, that they may consent to be led blind∣fold, and permit that an opinion shou'd be dictated to them without demanding that they may be reason'd into it.</P>
<P>Pag. 54. Ver. 24. BIG SEUTLAEUS TUMBLING.] ZOILUS has happen'd to brush the dust of some old manuscript, in which the line that kills SEUTLAEUS is wanting. And for this cause he fixes a general conclu∣sion, <Q>that there is no dependance upon any thing which is handed down for HOMER'S, so as to allow it
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>praise; since the different copies vary amongst them∣selves.</Q> But is it fair in ZOILUS, or any of his fol∣lowers, to oppose one copy to a thousand? and are they impartial who wou'd pass this upon us for an ho∣nest balance of evidence? When there is such an in∣equality on each side, is it not more than probable that the number carry the author's sense in them, and the single one its transcriber's errors? It is folly or mad∣ness of passion to be thus given over to partiality and prejudices. Men may flourish as much as they please concerning the value of a new-found edition, in or∣der to byass the world to particular parts of it; but in a matter easily decided by common sense, it will still continue of its own opinion.</P>
<P>Pag. 56. Ver. 17. WITH BORBOCAETES FIGHTS] Through the grammatical part of ZOILUS'S work he frequently rails at HOMER for his dialects. "These," says he in one place, <Q>the Poet made use of because he could not write pure Greek;</Q> and in another, <Q>they strangely contributed to his fame, by making se∣veral cities who observ'd something of their own in his mix'd language, contend for his being one of their natives.</Q> Now since I have here practis'd a licence in imitation of his, by shortning the word BORBO∣CAETES a whole syllable, it seems a good opportunity to speak for him where I defend myself. Remember then, that any great genius, who introduces Poetry into a language, has a power to polish it, and of all the
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>manners of speaking then in use, to settle that for Poe∣tical which he judges most adapted to the art. Take notice too, that HOMER has not only done this for ne∣cessity, but for ornament, since he uses various dialects to humour his sense with sounds which are expressive of it. Thus much in behalf of my Author to answer ZOILUS: as for myself, who deal with his followers, I must argue from necessity, that the word was stub∣born and wou'd not ply to the quantities of an English Verse, and therefore I alter'd it by the Dialect we call Poetical, which makes my line so much smoother, that I am ready to cry with their brother LIPSIUS, when he turn'd an O into an I, <Q>Vel ego me amo, vel me amavit Phoebus quando hoc correxi.</Q> To this let me add a recrimination upon some of them: As 1st, such as choose words written after the manner of those who preceded the purest age of a language, without the necessity I have pleaded, as <Q>regundi for regendi, per∣duit for perdidit,</Q> which restoration of obsolete words deserves to be call'd a Critical Licence or Dia∣lect. 2dly, Those who pretending to verse without an ear, use the Poetical Dialect of Abbreviation, so that the lines shall run the rougher for it. And 3dly, those who presume by their Critical Licences to alter the spellings of words; an affectation which destroys the etymology of a language, and being carry'd on by pri∣vate hands for fancy or fashion, wou'd be a thing we shou'd never have an end.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200"/>Pag. 59. Ver. 13. NOR PALLAS, JOVE!] <Q>I can∣not, says ZOILUS, reflect upon this speech of Mars, is where a Mouse is oppos'd to the God of War, the Goddess of Valour, the thunder of Jupiter, and all the Gods at once, but I rejoice to think that PY∣THAGORAS saw HOMER'S soul in hell, hanging on a tree, and surrounded with serpents, for what he said of the Gods.</Q> Thus he who hates Fables answers one with another, and can rejoice in them when they flatter his envy. He appears at the head of his squadron of Critics, in the full spirit of one utterly devoted to a party; with whom truth is a lye, or as bad as a lye, when it makes against him; and false quotations, pass for truth, or as good as truth, when they are necessary to a cause.</P>
<P>Pag. 61. Ver. 11. AND A WHOLE WAR.] <Q>Here, says ZOILUS, is an end of a very foolish Poem, of which by this time I have effectually convinc'd the world, and silenc'd all such for the future, who, like HOMER, write Fables to which others find Morals, characters whose justness is question'd, unnecessary digressions, and impious episodes.</Q> But what assu∣rance can such a ZOILUS have, that the world will e∣ver be convinc'd against an establish'd reputation, by such people whose faults in writing are so very noto∣rious? who judge against rules, affirm without reasons, and censure without manners? who quote themselves for a support of their opinions, found their pride up∣on
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>a learning in trifles, and their superiority upon the claims they magisterially make? who write of beauties in a harsh style, judge of excellency with a lowness of spirit, and pursue their desire to decry it with every ar∣tifice of envy? There is no disgrace in being censur'd, where there is no credit to be favour'd. But, on the contrary, Envy gives a testimony of some perfection in another; and one who is attack'd by many, is like a hero whom his enemies acknowledge for such, when they point all the spears of a battle against him. In short, an author who writes for every age, may even erect himself a monument of those stones which Envy throws at him: while the Critic who writes against him can have no fame because he had no success; or if he fancies he may succeed, he shou'd remember, that by the nature of his undertaking he wou'd but undermine his own foundation; for he is to sink of course, when the book which he writes against, and for which alone he is read, is lost in disrepute or oblivion.</P>

<L>And the gay picture's in my fancy lost.</L>
<L>With what an eager zeal the conscious soul</L>
<L>Would claim its seat, and soaring pass the pole?</L>
<L>But our attempts these chains of earth restrain,</L>
<L>Deride our toil, and drag us down again.</L>
<L>So from the ground aspiring meteors go,</L>
<L>And rank'd with planets, light the would below;</L>
<L>But their own bodies sink them in the sky,</L>
<L>When the warmth's gone that taught them how to fly.</L>
