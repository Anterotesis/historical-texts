<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 20, 1762.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>My dearest Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a very <HI>surprising</HI> and a <HI>cruel</HI> Thing,
that you will not suppose me to have been <HI>out of Order,</HI> after
such a Neglect of writing, as can hardly be <HI>excused</HI> on any
<HI>other</HI> Score. I cannot, indeed, lay Claim to what the Doctors call an
<HI>acute Disease:</HI> but <HI>Dizzi∣ness of Head,</HI> and
<HI>Depression of Spirits</HI> are at <PB N="2" REF="11"/> best no
<HI>trivial</HI> Maladies, and great <HI>Discourage∣ments</HI> to writing.
There is a lethargic State of <HI>Mind</HI> that deserves your Pity, not your
Anger; though it may require the <HI>Hellebore</HI> of sharp Reproof. Why
then did you not apply this pungent Remedy, before the Disease was gone
so far? But seriously, I pass too much of that Sort of Time, wherein I
am neither <HI>well</HI> nor <HI>ill</HI>; and being unable to ex∣press
myself at large, am averse to do so by Halves. From the strange
Laconicism of your Letter, I am really in Doubt, whether you are not angry at
me; and yet had rather this were owing to <HI>Anger</HI> that <HI>may</HI>
subside, than to any persevering <HI>Fondness</HI> you may have for
such unusual Brevity. Should the latter become habitual, I shall see
the Letters of a Genius dwindle to 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>per first will advise the
Needful.</HI>"</Q> God forbid such a Transformation!</P>
<P>Your <HI>former</HI> Letter, to my great Confusion, was dated
<HI>Sept.</HI> 18. Let me speak first to some few Parts of it—The
Lampreys arrived safe, and were as good as I ever tasted; but every Time I
tasted them, I wanted <HI>you</HI>; and you are mis∣taken, 
<PB N="3" REF="12"/> if you imagine, I can half relish such Cates
<HI>alone:</HI> however, I return you Thanks.</P>
<P>You gave me no Account how far the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> were judged expedient for you. A <HI>charitable</HI> Action
called you up to Town; and you, in the Benevolence of your Heart, presume,
that this <HI>accounts for</HI> the Neglect of every Advantage that concerned
<HI>yourself.</HI> Pray let me know whether the Bath was proper for you at
the same Time inform me, whe∣ther you were able to serve Mrs. H—. I
shall be sorry for <HI>you,</HI> as well as <HI>her,</HI> if you should
miss the Gratification you would derive from the Success of such an
Endeavour.</P>
<P>Were I rich, I would erect a Temple to <HI>Simplicity</HI> and
<HI>Grace</HI>; or, as the latter Word would be <HI>equivocal,</HI> to
<HI>Simplicity</HI> and <HI>Elegance.</HI> I am glad to hear that Mr. W— 
has under∣taken to deify the <HI>former</HI>; as he will produce better
<HI>Grounds</HI> for such a <HI>Consecration</HI> than was ever done by
Pagans, or by Papists, on any <HI>such</HI> Occasion. By the Way, I take
that God∣dess to be a remarkable Friend to Ease and In∣dolence. There is
another well-deserving Per∣sonage, <PB N="4" REF="13"/> <HI>Delicacy,</HI>
whose Cause has been strange∣ly deserted, by either Mr. MELMOTH, or Dr.
LANCASTER.</P>
<P>Will it make better for me, or worse, to say, I've not yet
written to Mr. GRAVES? But I will positively write, within this Week, if it
cost me a Dose of Salts to clear my Brain. As to what he says about my
printing im∣mediately, he <HI>may</HI> be <HI>right,</HI> and I am
<HI>sure</HI> he is <HI>friendly:</HI> but more of this in a little Time.</P>
<P>Since the Receipt of your last Letter, Mr. PERCY and his Wife came
and spent a good Part of the Week here; and <HI>he,</HI> also, would needs
write a Description of the <HI>Leasowes.</HI> Du∣ring the latter Part of
his Circuit, my Friend JAGO and I accompanied him; and what was produced on
that Occasion, you will go near to know in a little Time. Mean while I am
more and more convinced, that no Description of this Place can make any
Figure in Print, unless some <HI>Strictures</HI> upon <HI>Gardening,</HI>
and <HI>other</HI> Embellishments be superadded.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14"/>Mr. JAGO has been with me twice, having written a
Poem in blank Verse, which he leaves here for my Revisal. 'Tis a
descriptive Poem, called <HI>Edge-Hill,</HI> and admits an Account of the
Battle fought there, together with many legendary Tales and Episodes.</P>
<P>About a Week ago, I paid a Visit of two or three Days, which I had
long promised, to Lord FOLEY. His Table, for a Constancy, is the most
magnificent of any I ever saw: eighteen or twenty elegant Dishes; a
continual Succession of Company; his Behaviour, perfectly hospitable, and
his Conversation really entertaining. I most readily own myself to have
been under a Mistake, with Regard to his <HI>companionable</HI> Character. My
Reception was as agreeable as it could possibly be. As to the rest, he
has a most admirable House and Furniture; but without any Room or Utensil
that would stand the Test of <HI>mo∣dern</HI> Criticism. The Views around
him, wild and great; and the Park capable of being rendered <HI>fine;
twice</HI> as striking as it is at pre∣sent, if he would fell some Oaks,
under the Value of a Crown, and some Hawthorns, under <PB N="6" REF="15"/> the
Value of a Half-penny: but 'tis possible, at his Time of Life,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> nothing of this Sort will be undertaken. The two Things at
present remarkable are, his <HI>Lodge</HI> and his <HI>Chapel.</HI> The
Portico of the former, (designed by FLEET∣CROFT) affords three different and
striking Pro∣spects. The Chapel is so very superb and ele∣gant, that
Mrs. GATAKER has nothing to do but send you and me <HI>thither,</HI> to say
our Prayers in it. In reality, it is perfect Luxury; as I truly thought it,
last <HI>Sunday</HI> Se'en-night; <HI>his Pew</HI> is a <HI>Room</HI> with an
handsome Fire-place; the Ceiling carved, painted in Compartments, and the
Remainder enriched with gilt Stucco-Ornaments; the Walls enriched in the same
Manner; the best painted Windows I ever saw; the Monument to his Father,
Mother, and Bro∣thers, cost, he said, 2000<HI>l.</HI> the middle Aisle
rendered comfortable by Iron Stoves, in the Shape of Urns; the Organ perfectly
neat, and good, in Proportion to its Size: and to this Chapel you are led
through a Gallery of Pain∣tings seventy Feet long—And what would you
more? You'll say, a good Sermon—I really think his Parson is able to
preach one.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16"/>And now I come, lastly, to speak of your
Letter I received on Monday. What an uncommon Man you are! to take so much
Thought for <HI>those,</HI> who never took <HI>any</HI> for
themselves!—I have enquired after Mr. WEDDERBURNE, and it seems he is
a very clever and a very rising Lawyer; to whom I am the more obliged for
mentioning me, as I fear I have not the Honour of being the least known to
him.</P>
<P>Pray write to me as soon as possible, and I will make you
Amends (if <HI>Writing</HI> will make Amends) for the scandalous
<HI>Omissions</HI> of which I have been guilty. I have somewhat to tell
you of Lord L—'s usual <HI>great Kindness,</HI> when the Lords
D— and W— were last at <HI>Hagley</HI>; but I have not Time, and
must conclude, my dearest, worthiest Friend!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Mr. G—.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID indeed give you up for lost, as a Correspondent, and find
by your Letter that I am to expect very few future ones. I will endeavour all I
can, to avoid any Sus∣picion of your Indifference for my own Satis∣faction;
but I don't know for certain, that I shall be able, unless you assist
my Endeavours, like my good Genius, by a Course of suita∣ble Epistles, at
certain Distances. I myself correspond but very little now, so you will
meet with the more Indulgence. I don't find by your Letter that you have much
more Phi∣losophy than me. I can't tell, indeed, what the Situation of your
House is; I own, mine gives me Offence on no other Consideration, than that
it does not receive a sufficient Num∣ber of polite Friends, or that it is not
fit to receive them, were they so disposed; I would <PB N="9" REF="18"/>
else cultivate an Acquaintance with about three or four in my Neighbourhood,
that are of a Degree of Elegance and Station superior to the common run. But
I make it a certain Rule, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Arcere profanum Vulgus</HI>".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To banish the profane Vulgar.</NOTE></Q>—Persons who
will despise you for the Want of a good Set of Chairs, or an uncouth
Fire-Shovel, at the same Time that they can't taste any Excel∣lence in a
Mind that overlooks those Things; or (to make a Conceit of this Sentiment)
with whom 'tis in vain that your Mind is furnish∣ed, if the Walls are naked;
indeed, one loses much of one's Acquisitions in Virtue, by an Hour's
Converse with such as judge of Merit by Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet I am
now and then im∣pelled by the social Passion to sit half an Hour in my
Kitchen.</P>
<P>I was all along an Admirer of Sir THOMAS HEAD's Humour and Wit, and
I beg you will represent me in that Light, if Occasion happens. 'Tis not
impossible that I may pe∣netrate this Winter as far as your Neighbour∣hood,
connecting a Set of Visits which I have in my Eye. Tell Mr. WHISTLER, when
you <PB N="10" REF="19"/> see him, that if he must have <HI>some</HI>
Distem∣per, I cannot but be pleased that it is one which is the Fore-runner
of Longevity—Don't tell him so neither, for the Compliment is trite.
From the <HI>Birmingham</HI> Gazette, 
<Q REND="inline">"We hear that on <HI>Thursday</HI> last was

bethought him of a Piece of Tim∣ber in the Neighbourhood, that was converti∣ble
into good Gun-Stocks, and had some of it sent for into the Room, by Way of
Speci∣men.

not you contrive to have it sent me directly? I am quite in your Debt, with
Regard to downright Goods and Moveables, and what is the proper

more upon a Par with you, with Regard to Presents, though I never can, with
Regard to the Pleasures I have received from your Conversation.</P>

<P>Mr. WHISTLER, and you, and I, and Sir T. HEAD, (whom I should
name first, speaking after the Manner of <HI>Men</HI>) have just Variety

<HEAD>LETTER III. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Mr. JAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. JAGO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have not yet troubled you with a Letter, I have not been
void of all Enquiry, or Information concerning your Situation and Mr. HARDY's
Health; indeed, it is now many Weeks since I collected some Particulars
from your Brother, and I am now impatient for some further Intelligence. As
to the Particulars of our friendly Reception at <HI>Wroxhall,</HI> Mr. JOHN
JAGO has very probably acquainted you; he would, however, persuade me to give
you a distinct Account; being as∣sured, he says, it must be a good
Subject for Drollery. I don't know how far this would be proper: but I think,
when I write again to my Friend W—, to give <HI>him</HI> a Sketch of his
own Character, just as it appeared du∣ring the Time of our Visit. I do not
mean to give Offence, so I shall intermix many <PB N="13" REF="22"/> good
Parts of his Character, together with his Oddities. I believe the whole will
take up a Sheet of Paper, for I have already consider∣ed it. He has
Good-Sense, and Good-Nature at the Bottom; pity he should disguise the
former by one continued Air of Buffoonry, and the latter by a total Neglect of
common De∣corum.</P>
<P>Since I came home, I have done little else but plant Bushes,
Hazel, Hawthorn, Crab-Tree, Elder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with some few
flower∣ing Shrubs that I have had given me. I think nothing remarkable has
occurred; only one mi∣serable tempestuous Day, I had the Earl of STAMFORD
called to see my Walks, together with Mr. DOVEY, of <HI>Birmingham,</HI> and
two other Gentlemen. My Lord promised to come again in Summer, and invited me
to <HI>Enville.</HI> By the Way, he is now building a Gothic
<HI>Green-House,</HI> by Mr. M—'s Direction; and by all Accounts, the
Place is worth your seeing, when you come into this Country; 'tis but about
six Miles distant from hence. Pray do not you embroil me with Mr. M—,
in Regard to the Observations I made in his <PB N="14" REF="23"/> Walks.
Remember there were not a few Things with which I was greatly delighted; and if
there were a few that I less appeared to ad∣mire, it was owing to a
Consciousness, that I was amongst Friends only, and that I thought it

<HEAD>LETTER IV. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Mr. WHISTLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. WHISTLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is the first Evening I have had to myself since I left
<HI>Cheltenham</HI>; and as one wants some very favourite Subject to
en∣gross one's Thoughts a little, after a long Dissipation, I could think
of nothing more ef∣fectual than a Letter to one who has so large a Share in
them; beside, they have given me your Letter from <HI>Bradfield,</HI> and I
am in Pain till I have acknowledged so affectionate and polite a Present.
People, whose very Foibles are so many Elegancies, can scarce write any
Thing more agreeable than a plain, unaf∣fected Account of them. I remember, I
used to think this a Kind of Distinction between Mr. GRAVES and you; that
the one had the Knack of making his Virtues unenvied, and the other of
rendering (what I perhaps unjustly termed) his Weaknesses enviable. I am
al∣most <PB N="16" REF="25"/> afraid of inserting this, lest it should
seem to injure the superlative Esteem I have of you: but I must add,
that I consider a Mixture of Weaknesses, and an ingenuous Con∣fession
of them, as the most engaging and so∣ciable Part of any Character; if I did
not, I could not allot them you, whose Manner is so distinguishedly
amiable.</P>
<P>Since I left <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> I have been at Mr. B—'s, in
<HI>Bishop's-Castle.</HI> I rode one Morning with him about three Miles,
that I might say, I had been in <HI>Wales,</HI> and seen <HI>Brecon,
Caderi∣dis,</HI> and <HI>Plinlimmon,</HI> with an extensive Chain of other
Mountains. I called at a small Ale∣house, where the People lived all the
Winter without any Glass in their Windows. I was wondering how they could
live so, in a more cold Country than you have, perhaps, expe∣rienced. The
Wife said, 
<Q REND="inline">"True it was, she could like Glass very
well."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> says the Hus∣band, 
<Q REND="inline">"Glass is very genteel, that it is."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Nay,</Q> says the Wife, 
<Q REND="inline">"not for the Gentleelness nei∣ther, though it is
very genteel, that's the Truth on't."</Q> This Circumstance struck me a
good deal, that they should discover the genteelness <PB N="17" REF="26"/>
of Glazing, and never once think of its <HI>Ex∣pediency.</HI> Mr. B— is a
Man you would like upon Acquaintance, though, as I remember, you had some
Objection to the Superfluity of his Wit. We shall, in all Probability, have
frequent Interviews with him at <HI>Bath, London, &amp;c.</HI> He would fain
have seduced me to have travelled into <HI>Portugal, &amp;c.</HI> with
himself, and one Mr. MOORE, his Neighbour; an agreeable, modest Man, and
late Member for <HI>Bishop's-Castle.</HI> I declined it for two Reasons;
first, on Ac∣count of the Expence, and secondly, that I could not think of
spending two Years in <HI>this</HI> Part of my Life abroad; dead to one's own
Coun∣try, and procuring, at best, very perishable, and useless
Friendships in another. If I could have staid, I was to have gone with him
to a <HI>Welsh</HI> Sessions, fraught with Irascibility. He is a
Justice of Peace there.</P>
<P>As to good Acquaintance, though I much desire it, I have as
literally a Genius for avoid∣ing, as any one ever had for procuring it. I
cannot approach within fifty Yards of Servi∣lity for fear of it.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27"/>I want sadly to talk to you about a
thou∣sand Things. I have some Notion of spend∣ing a Week at Mr.
D—'s. Act sublimely, and give me the Meeting then,
notwithstand∣ing.</P>
<P>Though I was enamoured with the Polite∣ness of Mr. W—'s
Conversation, I should not, perhaps, have been very forward to express my
Sentiments, if you had not intimated, that he made favourable mention of me. I
begin to grow a little pleased with Prudence, and I think it a Debt one owes
her, to reserve one's Encomiums till one knows any one's mu∣tual Sentiments;
for certainly, he that happens to commend an Enemy, happens to condemn
himself. I beg my Compliments.</P>
<P>I believe poor J. D— is alive—Farther I c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnot learn.</P>
<P>I did not think it possible, I could have
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much engaged by love as I
have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ate.—Poor Miss
C—!</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="28"/>It must necessarily be an Honour to a
Girl, to have pleased a Man of Sense, (I know not but I am vain in
supposing myself of that Number) let his Station be how low soever. Now
it must be a Disgraee to captivate a Fool, however high it be; the former
is the strongest Evidence of Merit, the latter of the Want of it.</P>
<P>Now I talk of Vanity, I beseech you never check yourself in your
Letters—<HI>I</HI> don't purpose it; and I think it makes as pretty a
Figure in the Letters of a Man of Taste, as it does in the Embroidery of a
Beau. I am as much yours, as human Nature will admit of.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I promised you some Poetry for Mr. S—, I am afraid
that, through my Desire of recommending myself to his Family, my Tongue
out-run my Wit. If I laid any Sort of <HI>Stress</HI> upon what I was to
send, I am very sure it did so; and when you have read the Trifles
enclosed, you will be of the same Opinion.</P>
<P>It is probable, however, that I had an Eye to a larger Ode of mine,
upon the Subject of rural Elegance, which I have not now Time either to correct
or to transcribe; but which I will not fail to communicate to them upon
some future Occasion.</P>
<P>Or if my Promise regarded a Translation of the Mottos
<HI>here,</HI> I shall have the best Oppor∣tunity of performing it, when I
take the Free∣doms <PB N="21" REF="30"/> you have allowed me, with your po∣lite
Description of my Farm.</P>
<P>Am I wrong in detaining that Paper?—For positively, these
last few Days I have found myself a good deal feverish, and my Head has
been so much confused, that I was almost tempted to omit this
Message. In this Case, I think your Good-nature would have acquitted me
of <HI>Disrespect:</HI> but I could not suffer you to leave the Country
with so bad an Opinion of my punctuality.</P>
<P>It remains, that I present my best Respects to Dr. TURTON and
his Lady, and that I wish you an agreeable Journey to <HI>Oxford.</HI> I
purpose, in a few Weeks, that you shall be enabled to say something
more particular, in Regard to M—'s Poetry; in the mean Time, I desire
that he would accept my Compliments, and my Thanks for the Pleasure his
Verses have afforded me. Above all Things, assure Mr. ARNOLD of my most
unfeigned Esteem; and if he discovers any Partiality for my Place or me,
encourage it, that it may induce him, on a proper Occasion, to favour me once
more <PB N="22" REF="31"/> with his Company. You see, I am availing myself
of <HI>your</HI> Interest, to make all your Friends my own; and to attone for
this Piece of Sel∣fishness, it shall not be my Fault, if every Friend I
have be not yours, at least, with some Share of that Regard with which I

<HEAD>LETTER VI. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your agreeable Letter; read all the fine Things your (I
fear prejudiced) Good-nature made you say; at first distrusted them:
but when I reflected on the Person who said them, I found a strong
Inclination rise in me to believe them; but how to be convinced I was still
at a Loss; for I know it is in your Power, either to make Flattery pass for
Sincerity, or Sincerity (so justly dreaded from <PB N="23" REF="32"/> the
Unskilful) pleasing. But be it as it will, I shall be a Gainer by it; for
if 'tis Flattery, it will give me a fair Reputation, though un∣deserved, with
all who hear it; but if 'tis true, it will assure me, I deserve one from
all who can like you bestow one.</P>
<P>You enquired after Mr. D—. He, and his Lady, and Miss
B—s, have drank Tea with me twice within this Fortnight. We went to
<HI>Christ-Church</HI> Prayers together, from thence, arrayed in Gold and
Silver, we rushed into <HI>St. John's-Chapel,</HI> where we stood, knelt
and sate, (I won't say prayed) the whole Service-Time; for you know it is
usual there for Strangers to sit in the Choir, which we did, to the great
Advantage both of the Fan and the Snuff-Box, which were neither of them long
unemployed, during Divine Service. You know they are great Helps to Devotion:
Snuff cer∣tainly composes, and a Fan may waft a Soul to Heaven before it is
aware.</P>
<P>Mrs. L— still perseveres. She gave it out before she had
seen her, that Miss B— was like a Cat, which when she found Miss
B— <PB N="24" REF="33"/> had heard, she wrote a Letter to excuse
her∣self, and concluded most emphatically with these Words, 
<Q REND="inline">"No, Madam, I am not quite so unbred; it was not
I, but Common-Fame, said you were like a Cat."</Q> I really think here, that
Mrs. L— topt Mrs. L—'s Part. Mr. G— is still a Prude; I
see him sometimes, but should be glad to see him of∣tener. I know no
one Circumstance, but Breach of Sincerity, that can ever be a Reason with
me to slight my Friends. If a Friend of mine had broke all Laws, both human
and divine, yet had conspicuously preserved his Integrity to me, I
should only think myself the more obliged to him, and though I pitied him,
would never forsake him first; I should think he had a higher Notion of
Friendship, and that that was the only Tie which he dared not violate, for
which Reason I would not dare to be a greater Villain than he. I don't know
how this Thought came into my Head, but you see I was willing to spin it to
its full Length; if I have gone too far, you must impute it to that Rapture
of Friendship with which I am yours eternally,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE waited thus long upon a dilatory Lawyer, called, I
suppose, in <HI>Hebrew, Bel∣zebub</HI>; at least, I am confident, Lawyer
is but a synonimous Term for the Devil. I have stayed, and must stay,
to sign some Parch∣ments, which cannot be done without me; and his Delay
has caused mine, in not answering your kind Letter before. I must
likewise go to <HI>Winchester</HI> on the same Business, so that,
to put you out of a disagreeable Expectation, I pluck up Resolution to tell
you, I am afraid I cannot wait upon you this Summer; at once to resist your
Kindness, and my own In∣clination, in my Opinion, is a great Act of
Resolution, at least would be so, if I had any Degree of Choice left me:
but as it is, I think the enduring my Disappointment a great Trial of my
Patience. Mr. GRAVES will witness the <PB N="26" REF="35"/> Truth of my
Misfortune, who has been at <HI>Whitchurch</HI> lately, and who intended to
see you soon. I suppose he told you his Errand into these Parts, a
providential Thing for me, and one of the happiest Revolutions in my Life, if
it succeed, as I hope it will. My Spirits are quite grown rusty, with long
and fruitless Expectations of Happiness, and no Tools are fine enough to
polish, or, as the Artists say, to touch them, but yourself or Mr.
GRAVES. I knew nothing of his coming till I saw him, for which Reason I
looked upon him as mi∣raculous Manna or Food from Heaven.</P>
<P>I lament very much that you don't design to be in <HI>London</HI>
next Winter: I shall be there for about six Weeks, towards the Middle of
it. The Winter we met there, I thought a pleasant one, and enough to
encourage a se∣cond Meeting in the same Place—The only Place for
Whims, practicable there without Re∣proach, or falling from that Dignity which
'tis necessary for a Gentleman to maintain in the Country. I should like
mightily to indulge my Fancy in some innocent, private, romantic 
<PB N="27" REF="36"/> Expeditions; I know not what—But all Things as I
said, are possible there.</P>
<P>Mr. GRAVES tells me you are a great Oe∣conomist. If so, I hope
<HI>London</HI> will be the richer for it, and you the finer, as
<HI>Luxury</HI> is the Daughter of <HI>Industry,</HI> and <HI>Industry</HI>
again the Mother of <HI>Luxury,</HI> each reigning by Turns, and so the World
goes on. If you should go to <HI>London</HI> this Winter, you'll call at
<HI>Whitchurch</HI> by the Way, and we'll go together, which will prevent any
Disappointment. You will always be received here, with Acknowledgment of the
Favour you do us; so say we all, and present our Compliments in one
Garland to you, which I beg you will accept, though it is but coarse∣ly put
together, and you will oblige</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your kind Letter, and, in Spite of all you have said, I
must still think that the Obligation is entirely on my Side, and you have
only, in my Opinion, laid a greater Stress upon it by so generously
disclaiming it. I am resolved to be pleased with every Thing you say or
do, and if I were not, you are resolved I shall. I am very glad you intend
me a Visit; but am likewise very sorry, I must beg you to defer it for
some Time; our Family talk of going to <HI>Bristol</HI> very soon, and as
I have no where else to go, must go with them. If it was in my Power to
defer the Journey, I would gladly do it, to wait on Mr. SHEN∣STONE, at
<HI>Whitchurch</HI>; or if I could com∣mand the House in their Absence,
their Ab∣sence and his Presence would be to me a dou∣ble Happiness. But
as it is, I must, at present, <PB N="29" REF="38"/> be without a Pleasure,
which I hope will not always thus fly from me; I hope the lat-End of this
Summer, and Mr. SHENSTONE, will be both more favourable to me, and if so, I
shall reckon that the Spring of the Year is yet to come; I, who place the
Seasons en∣tirely in my own Fancy.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you in my last, that the Prin∣cess AMELIA did
us the Honour of a Visit at <HI>Whitchurch,</HI> though we were obliged to
the Stag for it, who seemed to fly from the Ho∣nour she designed him, and
had not Ambition enough (as LEE says) to meet the Blow half Way, or be
pleased with Death, though in the Royal Presence. It was a terrible Day,
and the Princess was wet through; she had rode thirty Miles when I saw
her, and she rode thirty Miles after that, which was six o'Clock at Night,
in her wet Cloaths, and appeared at the Drawing-Room at St. <HI>James</HI>'s,
the next Day, which was a Birth-Day.</P>
<P>The Princess (with Submission be it spoke) gave me no
Satisfaction, not through any De∣ficiency in her Demeanour—but from the
dis∣satisfied <PB N="30" REF="39"/> State of Mind. I could be contented with
nothing less than you; and I hope you will be so good, as not to let this
Disappoint∣ment, which I assure you is a great Disappoint∣ment to me,
be any Objection to my having the Pleasure of your Company another Time. With

<HEAD>LETTER IX. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not received your Letter above a Week ago, being but lately
come to Town, which is the true Reason why I have not an∣swered it. Few
Reasons, and none but good ones shall ever prevent me from presenting my
Heart to you: but my Journey hither has been prevented, partly by ill Health,
and partly by little, ill-natured, impertinent Accidents—This
Suspense had had an equal Effect on my writing to you. I here end my most
sincere Apology.</P>
<P>Now for News—I am in <HI>London</HI>; for which Reason, I
suppose I must not be excused; tho' I hate it, remember very little,
and am most likely to blunder in the Recital of that little. The House of
Commons have addressed the King to try MATTHEWS and LESTOCK, and six
Captains, by a Court-Martial, and it is <PB N="32" REF="41"/> thought, some of
them will be condemned.—Poor GARRICK has been dangerously ill of a
Fever this Week: but now, to my great Sa∣tisfaction, there are Hopes of his
Recovery; nay, it is noticed in the <HI>Daily Advertiser,</HI> that he will
perform a Part next <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night.</P>
<P>I have been to wait on Lord D—. He was very civil, and would
fain have kept me till he had opened his Heart with a Bottle of Wine; at
least, I imagined his forwarding the Bottle was with that Design; but I was
engaged. I am to call upon him to go to <HI>Ranelagh</HI>—a Lord would be
a pretty Nosegay in one's Hand, if he had the least Variety of Colours;
nay, if he resembled any one Flower of a single Co∣lour, except the
<HI>Fustus.</HI> Mr. F— I see some∣times, but he is not very
attractive. I always did envy you the Power of Laughing at a Fool by
yourself: but you are a World within yourself. Mr. P—K, I spent an
Evening with lately very agreeably: but he lives so far off, at the Court-End
of the Town, as separates us very much. Mr. P—N I often see, and find
him a very useful Person. But if you were here, both agreeable and useful
would <PB N="33" REF="42"/> vanish, and a far superior Enjoyment take Place.
Mr. GRAVES promised to be in <HI>London</HI> for a Week, but his little
Politics are, you know, very uncertain. I have struck a bold Stroke since I
have been in Town; I mean a laced Coat, for really Waistcoats cost as much,
and are no Mark of Distinction after all. Sir T. HEAD comes to Town this
Week; but I believe, I shall not stay above a Week longer, so would have
you direct to me at <HI>Whitchurch.</HI> I design to go to Court one Night. I
must, as you see, write short, my Paper drawing to an End. It is with
Pleasure I hear, that old People confess a Play is now worth seeing, and
that GARRICK excels BETTERTON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the Diversity of his
Genius, he must far exceed him; when we see him alternately in a
<HI>Rich∣ard</HI> and <HI>Scrub,</HI> in a <HI>Lear,</HI> and <HI>Abel
Drugger,</HI> he is truly astonishing. This Excellence of our dramatic
Representations is another Reason to wish you here. CAMPIONI is a
charming new Dancer. The <HI>Messiah</HI> was performed last Night, but I
could not go.—But I must write no more Tattle. I have just been with
Mr. SHUGBO∣ROUGH, and gave him your Orders about the Pamphlets, and have picked
out some myself, <PB N="34" REF="43"/> <HI>viz.</HI> the Odes, the new Play,
and the Poem on <HI>Sickness.</HI></P>
<P>I wish there had been any better Prints to have enclosed in this
Letter; I should have been glad to have sent them. The Pamphlets I have
ordered to be sent immediately, directed to be left at Mr. AUDLEY's, in
<HI>Birmingham.</HI> The Regret I always feel for your Absence will ever
instruct me how to value you, that is beyond what the elaborate Conclusion
of a Letter can express; therefore I will not endea∣vour to say how much,

Weeks Time, or sooner, and I have Reason to think it will be the last
Time I shall be there, I mean in my Gown. Now as I am willing still to
retain an agree∣able Image of the Place where I have spent so many happy
Hours, I make this Request, that you would stamp the last Impression
upon my Mind. I beg you would meet me there, and give me the Confirmation of
your Friend∣ship, which I shall esteem a greater Honour than all the
Degrees the formal Convocation can bestow; and I think of you, as JUBA does
of CATO, and declare, I would rather have your Praise, than Worlds for my
Ad∣mirers. <PB N="36" REF="45"/> I have forgot the Measure, but this is

<P>I lately wrote you a long Letter, as you were so kind to desire;
and in so very lazy unintellectual a Manner, that I am sure half the
Mortals, who only understand with their Eyes and by the Grammar, could never
have comprehended: but I would converse with you Soul to Soul, have a Hint
understood by you, and not be obliged to a tedious Pe∣riod to communicate a

you as yet—The last Sentence seems a Compliment to myself; but as I
am too lazy to alter it, I beg you would think with me, and interpret every
Thing I say in your own Favour. But thus the Devil will have it; the
Small-Pox is all over <HI>Oxford,</HI> in every Part of the Town, in most of

been for this Month past, and what I write now, proceeds, not from any Flow
of Fancy, but merely from Respect and Esteem. I have <PB N="41" REF="50"/>
been very much taken up of late, by our Fa∣mily being at Home: but that
Excuse I lay no Stress upon; for I shall never let any, ei∣ther
Business or Pleasure hurry you from my Thoughts. Ill Health can be my
only just Apology; and though I cannot say I have been sick, I can
assure you, I have not been well for some Time past. Put my Condition
in the best Light, I am very much in the Va∣pours, and so much, as that you
or Mr. GRAVES alone can cure me: a Letter from you will go a great deal towards
it; though I long for one, I can hardly go on with this Letter, which is the
Means to procure it; like one sinking into a fainting Fit, who can't collect
Strength of Mind or Body, to reach so much as the Hartshorn to his Nose,
which stands at his Elbow. I shall be at <HI>Oxford</HI> in a short Time,
and spend as many Days there as I can pass agreeably, and then take my
Leave of it. If the Town be healthy, I shall go to <HI>London</HI> the
Beginning of the Winter, and stay there just as long as it smiles on me.
But all Things seem to frown in the Absence of my Friends, and I wish I
don't think the Smiles of the Town impertinent without them. 
<PB N="42" REF="51"/> I wish I could be sometimes pleased with less than
you, without I could have you always. Pray write soon, and raise my
Spirits, for I really am forced now to conclude for Want of them,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you remember, in your last Letter but one, you advised me to
read History: ac∣cordingly, as I am always proud to follow your Advice, I
pitched upon BURNET's <HI>History</HI> <PB N="43" REF="52"/> <HI>of his own
Times.</HI> I was over Head and Ears engaged in the Disputes between
Cavaliers, Pro∣testers, Resolutioners, and God knows who, when I received
your last. Though BURNET values himself particularly on private
Intelli∣gence, I had a greater Curiosity, and enter∣tained far greater Hopes
of Pleasure, in break∣ing open your Letter; nor was I at all de∣ceived: I
think you wrote, if possible, more agreeably than usual; it raised my
Spirits, and at the same Time did more than all King CHARLES's Statesmen
could do: set up an ab∣solute Monarchy in my Breast in a Moment, and made
you Sovereign there.</P>
<P>Mr. POWYS had a Child christened yester∣day; it was attended to
Church by half a Dozen Coaches. The great Mr. POINTZ was one of the Godfathers,
and Mrs. TOWNSHEND, now an Inhabitant of your Parts, the God∣mother, by Proxy.
Mrs. POWYS went out on Pleasure to the last, and if her Horses had not
been good, and her Coachman dexterous to ply them with the Whip, she had been
brought to Bed in her Coach, as once before she had like to have been at the
Play-House.

<P>As to what you mentioned about your Poem; you can't think me such
a Barbarian, as that I should expect you should follow my Advice in every
Particular; I rather think you did me an Honour in doing it at all. I know the
great Critics have been long endeavouring to be ab∣solute; but I think it
very unreasonable even in them—and I believe you, as well as my∣self,
have too much Spirit to submit to it. If I can any Ways assist you, by
any little Observations, you shall have my Thoughts, and make use of them
at your Pleasure, for I am very fond of that Rule, of doing as one would be

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received you Pacquet, fraught with every Thing that could delight
me. I believe more Wit was never conveyed under the Title of a Peer before; not
even excepting your own, which, indeed, you generally export by wholesale in
the same Method. Your Letter led me through an Elysian Scene, which
de∣lighted me so, that I must beg Leave to take another Turn with you at
present therein. There is no Subject I can treat of with so much
Pleasure, and, of Consequence, with so much Advantage to myself. In the
first Place, Dick J—, in the Point of Light you set him, diverts me;
yet Humanity teaches me to feel a Kind of Pity, as for an Animal that sings
and hops about the Cage that has just de∣prived him of his Liberty. Lady
LUXBOROUGH I have seen, but not in her Sanctuary, where <PB N="47" REF="56"/>
she delivers her Oracles, and displays her Elo∣quence and Elegancies at
full. This is what my Soul is a-thirst after; the holy Land of a future
Pilgrimage. You have raised a Devotion in me towards her; for we always judge
of the Divinity by the Merits of the Priest. By your Description of Mr.
THOMSON, I admire him, and rejoice in your Acquaintance with him. I beg you
would cultivate it, for it seems like the Dawning of your Fame, whose Merit
the stupid World only wants to be awakened to see. If ever you get your due
Share of Fame, I insist that you be not a Niggard of it, as many are, but
do your ut∣most Endeavour to communicate it to your Friends—You see I
speak in Time.</P>
<P>As for Mr. L—N's Civility, I have no great Faith in it; I fear
he has only some private End to serve, as an Election or so: but,
how∣ever, I would have you nourish it, for it may breed something by
Chance—It will be a Cre∣dit to you at worst—Chance often promotes
Lingerers at Court, who have otherwise very little Hope. It may fall out,
that by serving <PB N="48" REF="57"/> you, he may serve himself. I
should like to have seen Signor OUTING, poor Man.</P>
<P>I think the <HI>Leasowes</HI> a charming Place in itself; but
not knowing how in my Imagina∣tion at any Time to separate the Work from the
Architect, I believe I give the former infinitely more Adoration than its due,
even with all its Improvements. You would often see me gliding across the
Glades, if the Soul was visible. You, indeed, have contrived to make your
Soul, as it were, visible; and a very beautiful Soul it is; particularly in
its last Dress, which became it exceedingly, I mean Elegy—It was
mighty well fancied, and dif∣fused a tender, languishing Air, its highest
Cha∣racter: I am much indebted to it for this splen∣did Visit; spendid I
mean in Beauty. The two old Songs likewise were very agreeable to me: but
chiefly <HI>Giles Collins.</HI> As for the Song of the <HI>Cat,</HI> I am much
obliged to you for it: but I think the Author sunk quite beneath himself
towards the End. The Conclusion was too sudden, and not worked up enough,
and besides was exceeding dirty; however, it was improved by your
Alterations: upon the whole, I <PB N="49" REF="58"/> like it, and out of my
Devotion for the five first Stanzas, I have added six more, which I
submit to your Judgment, whether I have supported the true Spirit of the
Fragment. Pray excuse that I have presumed to omit any of your Alterations;
because I thought in this new Scheme the Context required it.</P>
<P>I live in Hopes of seeing you at <HI>Whitchurch</HI> this Winter,
and of hearing the happy Tidings when; I beg you will let me know some Time
before you come, that I may get your Bed in order; I have but one; (it was
given me, and is none of the largest; indeed, small, which at present I
lament) otherwise I should now give more Invitations; I can entertain but
one Friend at a Time: but all my Friends will be sincerely welcome
severally. Again I say, I lament the Unsociableness of this Scheme, but
it is not in my Power to alter it. Mr. G—'s Affair goes on, I am afraid,
unhappi∣ly. As for my own Situation, I shall say lit∣tle, but leave you to
take a Survey of it, which I hope you will do soon. I think it is cal∣culated
for Happiness, if a Person of the least <HI>Delicatesse</HI> can be
so. I rejoice in all you have <PB N="50" REF="59"/> rejoiced in, and pray for
all you pray for, as becomes</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very much obliged to you for your last kind Letter, and
received your Absolution with a very contrite Heart, though I assure you
my Sin was not wilful; however, it was such as <PB N="51" REF="60"/> I
sincerely lamented, even in the Commission; I should rather say
Omission. I am exceeding sorry to find you have so great a Quarrel with
<HI>London.</HI> I speak sincerely, when I say, I pro∣pose little
Pleasure there without you. I said in my last Letter, we might contrive
to meet there, as hitherto; I think we have contrived not to do it, and if we
were to meet, I can't but fancy we might make it agreeable to each other. I
shall go thither immediately after <HI>Christmas,</HI> and should be glad
to wait on you at <HI>Whitchurch,</HI> and from thence to <HI>London.</HI> You
certainly conclude me happy, in having Mr. GRAVES so near me, and with
Reason. I should think my Scheme of Friendship com∣plete, if you was as
near; but without that Cir∣cumstance, it is far from being so. Sir T. HEAD
and Mr. GRAVES spent three Days with me last Week to my great
Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I have had a Swelling in my Foot, which they tell me is the
Gout—God forbid!—but 'tis certainly like it. I intend to go into a
Milk Diet immediately, for I am terribly alarmed. If it should prove so, I
shall think it a very hard Fate, having been no Drinker, and even 
<PB N="52" REF="61"/> Multitudes of those escape it: but Fortune fa∣vours
the Brutes.</P>
<P>It was not our Mr. POWYS's Landau, for he was at Home, and besides
has never a one. I believe Mr. GRAVES and I shall return Sir G—'s
Favour soon, and spend about a Week with him. How shall we all wish for
you to be with us! That I shall, I can be upon my <HI>Bible Oath</HI>; and
for the rest, I think I can answer in the affirmative. My Brother is at
<HI>Whitchurch</HI> at present, who is a constant Com∣panion to me while he
stays, but I fear that will not be long: but Mr. GRAVES I design to see
often, both for Health and Pleasure.</P>
<P>What with going to <HI>London</HI> this Win∣ter, and
<HI>Bristol</HI> in the Summer, as I have laid my Scheme for the future, I
shall make <HI>Whitchurch</HI> not quite so tedious to me; and above all,
the Thought of waiting upon you, both in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and at the
<HI>Leasowes,</HI> vastly brightens my future Prospect. My Father and
Mother desire to join with me in all Civilities to you—But I beg you
would believe I sur∣pass most People (notwithstanding your appa∣rent

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been extremely busy of late in new modelling my little
Habitation; and the more so, to bring it to some Kind of Perfec∣tion, in
Order to receive you. I have been building up, pulling down, planting, rooting
up, turning Round to Square, and Square to Round. In short, I don't know, but
some <PB N="54" REF="63"/> prudent People would say, I have been playing the
Devil. Indeed, (as in other Things in Life) my Fancy is so confined by the
Smallness of my Possessions, that my Scheme is not very expensive:
'tis all in the <HI>Lilliputian</HI> Stile, and must be so. Though I have
tried to give it what Air of Magnificence it is capable of, I suppose it
will strut like many of those un∣fortunate Heroes who happen not to be four
Feet and a Half high.</P>
<P>Did Lady LUXBOROUGH approve my Senti∣ment of enjoying Things best
by Reflection? I still maintain my Opinion, and endeavour to jus∣tify it
thus: What we enjoy by Reflection we have pure, nay, heightened by our own
Fancy, at the same Time no Inconvenience attends it; on the contrary, the
Pleasure is more poignant by the Contrast. The Thought of an Ice-House in
the Summer is refreshing, and the Imagination of <HI>July</HI> is a Cordial
in Frost and Snow; besides, you well know Hope is the very Hartshorn of
Life, that enlivens every Thing, and particularly attends imaginary
Pleasures, but vanishes whenever they become real—By Reflection, I
mean Imagination in general.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="64"/>I have sent you Stanzas on Flowers. If Lady
LUXBOROUGH likes them, I shall be proud of hitting the Pallate of a Lady of
so high a Taste. I have likewise enclosed another Copy of
Verses—though I am in Doubt, whether I did not send them to you
last Summer; they were done then. I know you don't love Transla∣tions, but
I have nothing new besides. I set about them merely as an Exercise one
Night, when I was dull and alone, not intending any Thing but tearing them
afterwards, for I knew it was a worn-out Subject—But a fatherly
Af∣fection took Place, and I did not care for mur∣dering it, though it was a
Bastard produced unawares.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I beg that nothing of mine may ap∣pear in Print.</P>
<P>I admire those two Lines of Lady WORTLEY's very much. It is a
natural yet uncommon and agreeable Thought. I am pleased with the Com∣pliment
you make me, in saying you always wish me with you to partake any
Pleasure, and imagine how any Thing extraordinary would <PB N="56" REF="65"/>
strike me: I like it, because I know it is a natural, and thereby, a
sincere Thought by my own Heart. I am so far gone that Way, that I can
hardly enjoy any Thing extraordinary, without my Friends are with me,
especially those whom I know it would particularly strike: but next to
gratifying a Friend, is the obser∣ving, how new and extraordinary Objects
work upon a natural Genius; I'll suppose it a Ge∣nius; I think it is one of
the highest Enter∣tainments in Life; when I can meet with such, and have an
Opportunity, I love to read a Play to them, though I know I run the Ha∣zard of
being laughed at for my Pains; but I don't care, the Pleasure pays me for all
the malicious foolish People can say, and you know the natural Criticisms
of Sir ROGER DE COVER∣LEY were not thought unworthy the Notice of the
<HI>British Spectator.</HI> For my Part, I have of∣ten thought that it is one
of the Amusements of the Supreme Being, who planted first the Passions
in us, to observe the Workings and Effects of them. A public Audience gives
me Pleasure upon Trust, for though I know no one there, I always conclude
there are some Geniusses.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="66"/>I am of your Opinion, with Regard to Mrs.
—, at present, for I think, if her Heart be really engaged, which I
very much doubt, Dishonour in Love is the blackest of all dishonest
Actions, and of the worst Conse∣quence—But his precursive Steps
were the Ex∣tremity of Folly, conducted with the Extremity of Folly; but he may
be happy (and I wish he may be happy) in any State of Life. I think our
Visits to DICK J— are fatal; his own Mother lay a dying when we were at
<HI>Henley.</HI> I am very glad to hear you have had so many Amusements. It
is always agree∣able to me, whenever I hear you have met with a flowery Meadow
in your sublunary Walk. If I have any Taste, your <HI>Hercules</HI> is an
elegant and truly poetical Poem, and su∣perior to L—'s: if it is not, I
resign my Taste, for I'll pin it upon your Poem. I don't pretend to
Criticism; but my Passion for SHAKESPEARE, MILTON, POPE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
has made me believe, that I have some natural Taste for Beauty. I am much
obliged to you for the two genteel Copies of Verses; they are very pretty,
and much to my Fancy. As for Odes, <PB N="58" REF="67"/> you have expressed
my Sense of them all on that of Dr. AKENSIDE; they perplex and fret one more
than they please, and may be de∣scribed by the Title of one of
SHAKESPEARE's Plays, <HI>viz. Much Ado about Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>I have no News to send you from hence, that will be in the least
entertaining to you. I am in Hopes Mr. GRAVES will settle at
<HI>Whitchurch</HI> about <HI>Whitsuntide.</HI> I have been much out of Order
for this Week, by a Cold that I caught in attending my Works; and my Foot gives
me ugly Apprehensions at pre∣sent. I continually please myself with the
Thoughts of seeing you at <HI>Whitchurch</HI>; but would never have you make
an Inconvenience of what I would have be a Pleasure to you—I'd have you
choose your own Time, that you may be quite unembarrassed: for my Part, I
think the sooner the better; only I would beg the Favour of one Line to
prevent all ill Ac∣cidents. I think 'tis a Method which should ever be
used; and I wonder at my own Im∣prudence, and my own Good Fortune last Time
I came to the <HI>Leasowes.</HI> I long to see you, and shall be all this
Summer at <HI>Whit∣church,</HI> <PB N="59" REF="68"/> ready to receive you.
Indeed, if I should have the Gout, as I something fear it, I would let you
know, for that would inter∣rupt all our Pleasure. I beg my Compliments to Mr.
DOLMAN: you have likewise the Com∣pliments of this Place. With Wishes to

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU see that I am as eager to answer your Letter as you was to
answer mine, and if my Letter gave you Pain, I assure you, that yours has
equally perplexed me. I am <PB N="60" REF="69"/> in great Hopes, you have
misinterpreted my Sense, in Regard to Mr. G—; and by as much as I can
recollect, I believe you have. He always speaks of you with the utmost
Re∣spect in your Absence, and is much less severe even upon what he
calls your little Faults, than when you are present: all that I hinted at,
was some little Shyness he lately shewed to me, on the Account which you
and I have often mentioned. I have heard you say, you have experienced the
same from him on the like Score. But you could not possibly be now
included, being absent; no, I assure you, I only spoke of myself; and
his Fault towards me would have been imperceptible, but to the Delicacy of
Friendship; nor been have worth communicating, but to one whom my Love would
animate against the like Failing. I de∣clare to you, the Sentence which
included Mr. G—'s Name, was the only one which regarded him; what
followed, though I confess that gave Rise to it, was only to shew my
different Sentiments, and I own my Esteem for Friend∣ship carried me a
great Length. I have been very particular to satisfy you, as well as to
justify Mr. G—, and by that Means to jus∣tify <PB N="61" REF="70"/>
myself. I should have never have for∣given myself, if I had been the
Cause, though inadvertently, of dividing so much Worth as I have always
discovered in you both, and which though separated, it might still
continue to bless me, yet when united, like most other Things, it has a
more powerful Effect. I would not have Mr. G— know a Word of this, for
the most trifling Reflection, when told again, is offensive; nor should I
have said what I did, but to a common Friend; in Truth, it is not every-body
who possibly might feel it so acutely as myself; but you know my
Disposition. I have a Sensibility in my Friendships, that arises even
to a <HI>Soreness,</HI> and the slightest Air of Coolness makes me
wince. This, though in its Consequences sometimes it may render me
unpleasing to my Intimates, certainly has its Source in a Merit, namely, in
the <HI>Ardour</HI> of my Attachments; and therefore I should hope is
easily pardonable. You remember the ele∣gant Line in COTTON's beautiful
Vision of Friendship; 
<Q>"Cold is the only Ill they fear."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71"/>After I had sealed my last, I was afraid it
had rather an Air of Compliment than Since∣rity; if it had, I assure you,
it was only the <HI>Air,</HI> and what the Good-humour, I am always in when I
write to you, might inspire me with. You see the Esteem I have for you,
by turn∣ing Critic on myself in your Behalf. I am now going to mention, what
there is no Occa∣sion at all to say, but Friendship is the most
incontinent Thing in the World; I have long been sensible of your Worth;
that is, ever since I knew you; but I must say, I think it was our last
Meeting which entirely united me to you; every Letter of yours since has
heigh∣tened my Affection for you. I look upon this as my first Absence from
you; your Letters are now necessary to supply your Presence; you
yourself taught me this Taste of Luxury, therefore it is but reasonable
you should sup∣port the Expence. In short, I beg you would write soon.
I am afraid I shall tire you by so frequent a Correspondence, but I

<P>I Promised to give you some Account what became of

valuable. Pos∣sibly before this Time, you may have forgot both my Promise
and me, and it may not be extremely political to renew your Remem∣brance of a
Person who has been so long seem∣ingly neglectful. The Truth is, I can no
more bear to be forgot by those I esteem, than I <PB N="66" REF="75"/> can
be censured of Forgetfulness with Regard to them, and I know no Way but
Writing, by which I can evade both.</P>
<P>Some Sort of Apology I ought to make, that I did not write before;
you will there∣fore please to observe, that I am but just ar∣rived at
Home, though I left <HI>Cheltenham</HI> the Day after you. I stayed, indeed,
to hear Mr. B— preach a Morning Sermon; for which I find Mrs. C— 
has allotted him the Hat, pre∣ferably to Mr. C—. Perhaps you may not
remember, nor did I hear till very lately, that there is a Hat given annually
at <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> for the Use of the best foreign Preacher, of which
the Disposal is assigned to Mrs. C—, to her and her Heirs for
ever. I remember (tho' I knew nothing of this whilst I was upon the Place) I
used to be a little misdeemful, that all who preached there had some
such Premium in their Eye. This Hat, 'tis true, is not quite so valuable as
that of a <HI>Cardinal,</HI> but while it is made a Retribution for Ex∣cellence
in so (if properly considered) sublime a Function, it is an Object for a
Preacher in any Degree. I am sorry, at the same Time, <PB N="67" REF="76"/>
to say, that as a <HI>common Hat,</HI> merely for its <HI>Uses,</HI> it
would be an Object to too many <HI>Coun∣try Curates,</HI> whose Situations

<HEAD>LETTER XX. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Miss CARTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Miss CARTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERHAPS you may remember to have seen an odd Kind of Fellow when
you were at <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> who threatened you with a Let∣ter, and who is
now endeavouring to be as <HI>bad</HI> as his Word; however he hopes for some
lit∣tle <PB N="69" REF="78"/> Partiality on his Behalf, having delayed the
Execution of his Menaces for a consider∣able Time, and even now promising
to say as few Things in your Favour as the real Sen∣timents of his Heart will
admit of.</P>
<P>But Peace to Buffoonery.—After I part∣ed from you, Mr.
M—N, with great Simplicity, endeavoured to keep up my Spirits, by
speak∣ing in Praise of the Family we had left, as though that was not the
ready Method to aggravate the Sense of one's Loss; and yet to aggravate it
was utterly impossible in the Opi∣nion of a Person already so
sensible of it. But he mentioned one Article which was more
suc∣cessful, and that was a Proposal to accom∣pany me to <HI>Stoke,</HI>
and to let me know when it suited his Convenience.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> I was not un∣mindful of that
solemn Vow that I had made, not to survive your Family there a single
Hour: but I found it near five o'Clock, and my Con∣science said, that as I
had made it so late, by my Attendance upon you, though I did stay another
Night, I hoped I might be excused.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="79"/>I have been, since leaving this Town, at Mr.
BROWN's, who lives upon the Borders of <HI>Wales.</HI>—Poor Man! He has
been the most obliging Person in the World to the most stu∣pid of
Companions. 'Tis hardly possible to determine which was greater, the Zeal
with which he shewed me his Fossils, Plants, Poe∣try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or
the stupid Inattention with which I observed them. He commends you and Mrs.
AUBREY highly; so, indeed, do all I know, or I would soon forget that I had
ever seen their Faces. He had found out a Method at last of seducing me
to talk, by frequent Men∣tion of your Merits, and it was a good While before I
discovered his Artifice; and even when I had discovered it, I was ill able
to elude the Force of it.</P>
<P>I am now just returned Home, which is my Apology for not writing
to you about <HI>Chel∣tenham</HI> as I promised. I really scarce recollect
any Circumstance belonging to it, except that you and Mrs. AUBREY were there
the most fa∣vourable, agreeable, and praise-worthy.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="80"/>What, does Mr. M— boast of the glorious
Absurdity he committed at parting, in mis∣taking my Horse for his? When I
see him next, I will produce a Hundred I have been lately guilty of, to no
one of which his is able to compare. His, you know, commenced in the very
Moment of parting, and consequent∣ly was little wonderful, in Comparison of
those I have since committed; besides, his Horse had a Spot or two of
Brown on him, and was therefore easily mistaken at such a Time for one
that was Sorrel all over.</P>
<P>After all, you are a very wicked Lady—you defrauded me of the
Croslet you promised me, putting me off with a single Bead; but it was
yours, and that's enough. The most trivial Donation from a Person we
esteem, has a large Value. I acknowledge to have a great <HI>Penchant</HI>
for what the Vulgar call <HI>Keep-Sakes.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> are notably
practised in these little Elegancies; we are not so much so, as, I
think, a polished People ought to be.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS some Time since at Mr. WHISTLER's Chamber, when he
received a Letter from you, the Sight of which revived in my Mind the
pleasing Correspondence you once favour∣ed me with; the Loss of which I
much re∣gret.—Do you never think of returning to <HI>Oxford?</HI> Have
you left nothing there that may give us Leave once more to expect you? I won't
be so poetically complaisant, as to say every Thing appears grieved at
your Ab∣sence, but I assure you, Sir, there are some that seem
sincerely to lament it. I can't com∣pare those little People that have
sometimes <PB N="73" REF="82"/> censured you, to any Thing but Ants, who are
generally most troublesome in the finest Season. I can't hope, that
even a short Stay at <HI>C—</HI> could be made agreeable, but Novel∣ty
is sometimes pleasing; descend then, and see the new Acquaintance I
have made, which is like to prove a very lasting one: may yours be no less
so!—Mr. GRAVES is in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> and Mr. WHISTLER,
God knows where, and you unkindly conceal from me the Place of your
Residence. I shall direct this wandering Epis∣tle as usual, but
imagine, if it is so fortunate as to find you, it will be in your Hermitage,
where I presume you are before this retired. Were I Mr. WHISTLER, with what
Pleasure should I leave the World, and all its Vanities, for Mr. SHENSTONE
and a Cell—Though I must own, your Intention of making Mr. L—N
im∣mortal, by a Dedication, and singing the Praises and Virtues of the
Court, seem to cherish gayer Thoughts than suit that peaceful Station.
Whether Hermit or Courtier, be assured that whatever conduces to your
Happiness is sin∣cerely wished by me</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. S. D—, Esq. to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN omit no Opportunity of shewing my Desire of continuing a
Correspondence that has always given me so much Pleasure. I wrote you a
Letter some Time ago, and should have used so little Ceremony, as to
have troubled you with another, had I known in what Part of the World you was.
If you know any Thing of Mr. G—, I should be glad to hear something
of him; I am informed that he is a Curate in some Village very
remote—It is a great Pity, so much Merit should be no better
rewarded. We have been returned from <HI>London</HI> about three Weeks: if I
had known you were in Town, I should have left it with much more Reluctance.
If you come into <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> this Summer, I hope you will fa∣vour me
with a Visit at <HI>C—,</HI> which will be a very great Pleasure to
us all.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="84"/>You cannot imagine how happy you have made me,
in giving me Hopes of enjoying a Sight of your Poems; from which I am sure of
reaping a Pleasure which can admit of no Addition, but by receiving them from
your own Hands. I am glad to hear that Mr. G— is settled so much to
his Satisfaction: if he is at <HI>All Souls,</HI> I hope I shall see him
be∣fore he leaves <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>I have lately lost a very agreeable Relation and sincere Friend.
Perhaps you have heard Mr. WHISTLER mention Miss B—: she died at
<HI>C—</HI> about three Months since, after a short Illness of two
Days; which added so much to the melancholy Situation here, that we were
obliged to fly to Town for Amuse∣ments. I came down ten Days since, and
shall return again to-morrow, for about a Week longer. May I hope, dear Sir,
to find a Let∣ter here from you? I am sure the reading of it will give me
more real Pleasure than any Company or Diversion I can propose to find in
<HI>London.</HI> I am sorry to send you any News that will give you
Concern; but can't help <PB N="76" REF="85"/> telling you, that I hear poor Mr.
R. G— is dangerously ill of a Fever in Town. Mr. WHISTLER has left
<HI>Oxford,</HI> on Account of the Small-Pox, which is very much there, and at
present in <HI>Pembroke</HI> College.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this unseasonable Weather, I must beg leave
to put you in Mind of your Promise, and enquire when it is you design us
the Pleasure of your Company in <HI>Oxford∣shire</HI>; where you will meet

<P>My best, and I think I may say, my only dear Lord, Lord

of Negligence, in answering such agreeable and sprightly Letters, as
those of her Ladyship; and I could almost wish, though the Perusal of
them gave me the greatest Pleasure, that you had not favoured me with a
Sight of them; <PB N="79" REF="88"/> as I cannot help drawing <HI>Omens</HI>
from them to myself the most dreadful: if you did not then mean me
<HI>ill,</HI> in your obliging Compli∣ment of the Sight of them, let me see

slighted a Lady's Favours, you will not neglect a sincere Friend, who
admires and esteems you more than (from what I think I have heard you say
of her Ladyship) <HI>she could.</HI> But to wave this, and leave you to
your own Generosity; I must thank you for yours of <HI>March</HI> 26th; had
I not depended on your Promise in it, I should have again trou∣bled you
e'er this: but I must now tell you, that I hope the Week after
<HI>Easter</HI> Week, for the Pleasure of your Company here, and if
con∣venient, to take a Bed with us. In the Ho∣lidays, I apprehend we shall
have Holiday Company, which will be neither agreeable to <HI>you</HI> nor
<HI>us</HI>; as we shall not by such Interrup∣tion be able to pay the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MAKE no Doubt, but you will be much surprised at the Receipt
of this, and like wise greatly concerned at the melancholy Oc∣casion of it.
As the Friendship subsisting between you and my Brother has been of
so long standing, I should be glad to communi∣cate its Contents to you
more gently by some other Hand; but for Want of a Friend in your
Neighbourhood, who has the Honour of your Acquaintance, must do it myself
in the least affecting Manner I am capable.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="91"/>The Beginning of this Month, my Brother was
taken ill of a sore Throat, which con∣tinued for some Days, without any
apparent Symptoms of Danger; indeed, towards the last it was judged the
Disorder was throwing it∣self off: but to the great Surprise of every
one, a Mortification in his Inside was then be∣gun, and came on so fast,
that it was out of the Power of Art, to stop it, of which he ex∣pired the
10th. In <HI>April,</HI> I had the Pleasure of his Company at
<HI>Bristol</HI> for a few Days, with my Father, when amongst other
agreeable Schemes for this Summer's Amusement, he proposed to himself
very great Pleasure, from paying Mr. SHENSTONE a Visit—But Man
proposes and God disposes. I have lost a very good kind Brother;
therefore hope those who were his Friends will continue their Friendship to
me for his Sake, which I shall always endeavour to deserve. To give you
this melancholy In∣formation is a painful Duty; but it is what I am compelled
to pay. I can, in some Mea∣sure, conceive the many afflicting Recollections
which will arise in your humane Mind, on this Event! Your Friendship and
Correspondence <PB N="83" REF="92"/> subsisted a considerable Time,
and with recipro∣cal Satisfaction. He was unquestionably en∣dowed with
natural good Sense, well improved by Education and Reading, of a lively
plea∣sing Fancy, and a benevolent Heart. He was, in short, what your Pen
might most exquisitely describe, but what mine is unequal to.</P>
<P>I beg your Acceptance of a Ring, in Re∣membrance of him, which
shall be conveyed to <HI>Birmingham</HI> the first Opportunity. My Fa∣ther
desires his Service. My Wife likewise joins with me in Compliments. I am,
Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>your obedient, humble Servant, J. WHISTLER.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor can give no precise Account of the Dates of Mr.
WHISTLER's Letters. This last, however, from his Brother must have been
written in the Year 1754; that being the Year which deprived him of so
valuable a Brother, and Mr. SHENSTONE of such an amiable Friend and
Correspondent. According to this Calculation, these Letters of Mr. WHISTLER
should have come earlier in this Collection, but they did not come Time
enough into the Editor's Hands. The same Reason must also be advanced
for some other Letters being misplaced in Point of Time; but as the
several Subjects are independent of each other, it is an Error (the Editor
presumes) which the Reader will more readily
excuse.</NOTE></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should with Pleasure have obeyed your kind Command, and troubled
you with a Let∣ter before this, but that I waited to give you some Account of
your Friends here. I saw Mr. DODSLEY soon after I came to Town; he seems
a very good Sort of Man, and I like him much; I believe he is quite satisfied
with the Success of his Play, for he is in good Health and Spirits.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tragedy of <HI>Cleone,</HI> produced at
<HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre.</NOTE> Mr. WREN I could not meet with, till
<HI>Friday</HI> last, when I found him very busy with half a Dozen young
Ana∣tomists, (for such I presume they were) and Pen, Ink, and a Ream of
Paper before them; had I been free enough with your Friend, I should
certainly have enquired, what weighty Discoveries they had been engaged in,
for they all looked prodigious wise when I entered the Room; but I was soon
left <HI>Tête-à-Tête</HI> with <PB N="85" REF="94"/> Mr.
W—, and then Subjects of still greater Importance, such as Plays,
Operas, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> were to be discussed. Without a
Compliment, I think our Friend improves upon Acquain∣tance much; but I wish
him, as you tell him, less volatile: to say the Truth, when you brought him
to <HI>W—</HI> with K—, he was so very alert, that I was not (but
that he came with you) much prejudiced in his Favour; however, I find he has
more Merit than those over-lively young Gentlemen gene∣rally have; and I
doubt not, but when you have pruned the Luxuriancy of his Sprightli∣ness, he
will make a very good Figure.</P>
<P>I am sincerely sorry, my Congratulations on your having a Place
under Government were premature; but I cannot say, I wish you, as your
Friend GRIFFITH terms it, <HI>Polaury,</HI> though I know it could not have the
Effect on you, it so evidently has had on —: but what any one could
think due to CIBBER's Merit, Mr. SHENSTONE ought to think beneath him.</P>
<P>I have not the Book you enquired for in yours, nor any one that I
can recollect, from <PB N="86" REF="95"/> you. The Letters you were so good as
to send me, are safe locked up in my Bureau, and shall be returned when
we meet; I took the Liberty of keeping them, as I had no Opportunity of
sending to the <HI>Leasowes</HI> before I set out for <HI>London:</HI> if
you have any Com∣mands here, I hope you will oblige me with them, and when you
are at Leisure, let me hear from you: but DODSLEY tells me, you are
re-perusing your Elegies, (he hopes for the Press) and I would not
interrupt you from such Engagements for the World, as you have too long
deprived the Learned and Tasteful the Pleasure of admiring them.</P>

<L>Far from all Resort of Mirth,</L>

innocent ones, lose much of their Power to please, unless participated
with those who have refined Sense enough to enjoy and partake those
delicate Feelings with a Friend—few such are ever to be found here, and
without such, where's the Society? Dissipation, my Friend, is the
ge∣neral <PB N="88" REF="97"/> or chief Amusement of this Town, to the
Generality of People; and though it abounds with Amusements and Pleasures
truly rational, yet by a too frequent, if not cor∣rupted Use, these very
Pleasures become irra∣tional; such they are to the Generality of my
Acquaintance, and though I hope I do not pre∣tend to be wiser than they, yet
I cannot feel a Pleasure in going with them to Entertain∣ments of the
noblest Kind, where I must not attend, but join with them in endeavouring
to draw off the Attention of others, to my Com∣panion or self; for this
Reason then, I gene∣rally go to a Play, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by myself, and by
this very Means, lose much of the Pleasure I should otherwise receive
from it. I wish,

ungenerous Contempt, that you in∣timate is so generally its Attendant: but be

so low a Passion, and the Admi∣ration of every

for true Happiness; be yourself, and be happy—but I grow

would, from your Good-nature, meet with the Pardon I think I might say it

unfashionable Re∣serve I told you in my last I labour under. I am
sincerely desirous of being dear to you; and if the 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>eadem velle atque eadem nolle</HI>"</Q> is a
good Omen of a lasting Friendship, I have good Reasons to hope, that the
Names of W. SHENSTONE and A. B— will ever be mu∣tually esteemed by each
other; for without meaning a Compliment, but to my own Judg∣ment, I really
think, to know what you like or dislike, some <HI>few</HI> Persons
excepted, is suf∣ficient to make me do the same: but I beg for the future,
when you mention the Valua∣bles <HI>London</HI> robs the Country of, at this
Sea∣son, you will not immediately add, that Lord P— is just set out
from <HI>N—</HI> on his Way here.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="103"/><HI>A-propos!</HI> You tell me you are busy
in re∣gulating your Library; will not you laugh at me, if I draw a
Comparison, and tell you that I am engaged at present in a similar
Affair? Regulating the Friends I henceforward design admitting into my
Heart's inmost Recess. You, I dare say, even in <HI>your</HI> Library
have admit∣ted some Rubbish, you will now throw out; how much then must
I, who from a very Child have been a Kind of Enthusiast in Friendship,
have to cleanse from my Esteem? Indeed, I find upon Examination, I have
been much out in my Collection, and have ranked many <HI>fuga∣cious
Pamphlets,</HI> as JOHNSON calls them, as First∣rate Authors; but I shall
make a total Rum∣mage, and hope, for the future, my Taste will be more
refined; indeed, I do not fear it, for I have chosen your Worship sole
Librarian of the Place; and to say the Truth, I find you so delicate a
Gentleman, that you have routed every other living Soul, (my own
<HI>nearest</HI> Relations excepted) nor can I find that you will admit any
one else to enter the poor Cell you have the Charge of but Lord D—:
well, well, you are quite right; I shall have enough <PB N="95" REF="104"/> to
do to value you two as I ought; you <HI>two</HI> shall be my Study, and if I
don't improve enough from reading you, it will be my Fault: for the Pamphlets,
I shall dip into them oc∣casionally, at an idle Hour, unless a female one
demands my closer Application; but I promise you, I shall be very
cautious in my Choice of her.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you, for offering to introduce me to the
Acquaintance of Dr. G—. I should eagerly lay hold of the Favour, but
that I purpose leaving <HI>London</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> the 26th of this
Month, and shall not have Time to pay him the Attention I owe every Friend of
Mr. SHENSTONE's.</P>
<P>I have from your Recommendation read the History of <HI>La
Pompadour,</HI> and like it very well; it seems authentic, though not much to
the Honour of the <HI>Dame</HI> or <HI>Louis le Grand.</HI></P>
<P>I shall expect two Letters from your Wor∣ship, in answer to my
last Nonsense and <HI>this,</HI> and pray, good Sir, do be not so very
concise. Mr. SHENSTONE, believe me, is worse Com∣pany <PB N="96" REF="105"/>
than any Man, when <HI>he</HI> is silent; most People know how agreeable
every Word he says is, and when he is pleased to be mute, cannot but be
uneasy. According to this, you'll say, your Friend wishes you to kill
yourself with talking; not so—but he refers the Whole to your better
Judgment, who knows best (when your modest Humility does not too much
in∣terfere) how to do every Thing with the best Grace.</P>
<P>If you have by you your <HI>Ode on Autumn,</HI> or <HI>Damon's
Bower,</HI> and care to trust them by the Bearer, you will do me a great
Favour in sending them. If you can venture out of your agreeable
<HI>Shell</HI> at the <HI>Leasowes,</HI> and (provided you are preparing your
Elegies for the Press) will bring them with you, not letting the Fa∣vour you
do us delay the Pleasure you will give the polite World in publishing them,
we shall think ourselves happy in accommodating you with a warm Room, Pen,
Ink and Paper, in this Part of the World.</P>
<P>I return the Duchess of SOMERSET's Letters, which I have perused
with great Pleasure, par∣ticularly <PB N="97" REF="106"/> those which give
the Honour due to my Friend, Mr. SHENSTONE.</P>
<P>You have the joint good Wishes of our present contracted
Fire-Side.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Compliment you make me, of desi∣ring me to correct, abridge,
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> the Sheets you have so obligingly sent me, puts me
so much in Mind of MOLIERE's reading his Plays to his old Woman, before he
produced them <PB N="98" REF="107"/> to the Stage, that I can hardly persuade
my∣self, though I am but just turned twenty-seven, and have a good Pair
of Mr. DEHENNIC's fa∣vourite <HI>Lambskin</HI> Breeches on, that I am not of
the other Sex, and at least seventy: as such I have presumed to give
you my Opinion freely, (which you will find first interspersed on little
Bits of Paper, among your Proof-Sheets) and I desire you will not esteem it
in any other Light. I am vain enough of the Friendship you have
distinguished me with, and I desire you will not let your kind Partiality
make me more unworthy of it than I am, by adding to my Vanity. As a Poet I
admire, and as a Friend I love you: but you must not ap∣ply to me, for what I
am not able, with any Credit to myself, to oblige you in. I am glad you
sent DODSLEY's fourth Volume, as I parted with my Set of his Poems this
Sum∣mer to a Friend, who begged them of me. Am much obliged to you, for the
Print of your Grove, and though I think it makes not near the Figure on Paper
so lovely a Scene would be imagined to do, shall value it much.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="108"/>I ought to make many Apologies for keep∣ing the
Books you were so kind as to lend me, so long; but in such Estimation
do I hold every Thing that comes from the <HI>Lea∣sowes,</HI> that a common
Attention to it will not satisfy me, and I cannot readily part with it in
haste; this then must excuse me to you, and I flatter myself it will,
as I know you are my Friend.</P>
<P>Adieu, dear Mr. SHENSTONE. The sooner you favour us with your
Company, the more you will oblige us all.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am very sorry you have been so much in∣disposed since I
left you. Bleeding, Vo∣miting, Purging, the Doctor, and the Disease, are
too many Enemies for a Man to strug∣gle with at once; and I heartily wish
you Joy of your Victory against such apparent Odds. I am sure, I have
very little Reason to sup∣pose, you make Sickness a Plea for
Laziness, since you have taken infinitely more Pains on my Account, than
you seem disposed to take on your own. Pray think of this, and learn to
love yourself as well as you do your Friends; pay as much Regard to your own
Fame as you do to theirs, and the World will be obliged to you.</P>
<P>I received a Letter from Mr. EAVES; he tells me, the Fables are
finished, and that they <PB N="101" REF="110"/> will come up to Town this
Week. I shall be very glad of it; for I find even then, that I shall not be
able to publish before <HI>February.</HI> You tell me the Portrait is

it; and here the Winter is passing away, and I am losing the Pleasure

<P>HOPING by this Time you are in a fair Way of Recovery, I venture to
write to you. Indeed, I was extremely alarmed by the Account Dr. ASH gave me of
you in his first Letter, and also by a Line from Miss H—: but by a

I received some Hopes of your Recovery, tho' not enough to encourage me to
write to your∣self, for fear of the worst. I have been ex∣tremely uneasy
indeed, and still continue so. Pray let MOLLY, or somebody, give me a
Line, to satisfy me how you are. Don't offer to write yourself, if it be
the least uneasy to you: I will be satisfied with hearing from any Hand
that you are better, and when you are able to write yourself, I shall be
happy. Lord S— is come to Town, and in a Day or two I pur∣pose to wait

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. Mr. DODSLEY to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sorry I hurried my Essay out of your Hands, before you
had done with it; but if I think of publishing my Fables next
<HI>Oc∣tober</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> it is high Time I should put both to
Press now, that the Printer may have good Weather to print in, and that the
Work may have Time to dry, after it is finish∣ed, before the Books are bound.
But as it <PB N="104" REF="113"/> happens, I cannot begin till the latter End of
this Month, as the Printer is not at Leisure; however, I have put my Plates
in Hand, and they are going on as fast as possible. I never received Mr.
ALCOCK's Drawings; so I have got two others executed, of somewhat a
dif∣ferent Design. I will not put the Essay in Hand till the last,
which may, perhaps, be about <HI>July,</HI> as I shall be very desirous of
its having the Advantage of your Corrections. But am I not to hope for a new
Fable or two from you? You see how I dwindle in my Expectations: but pray
don't let me be <HI>quite</HI> disappointed. I propose, if possible, to
finish the Printing of my Fables before I set out on my northern
Expedition. Mr. M—, and his Lady, will be at <HI>Nottingham</HI> about
the latter End of <HI>August</HI>; they have wished I would meet them
there, and in their Return to Town, bring them round by the
<HI>Leasowes.</HI> Mr. BURKE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of <HI>the
Sublime and Beautiful.</HI></NOTE> has also a strong Inclination to meet us
there; so that possibly we may be happy enough to spend a Day with you;
another must be spent at Lord LYTTELTON's, (as they are both ac∣quainted 
<PB N="105" REF="114"/> with him) and a third at <HI>Birmingham.</HI> I shall
hate the Name of D— as long as I live: he is crooked in all his Ways; but
the Devil will set strait with him one Day or other. I have not seen a
Page of Mr. PERCY's Novel, and therefore cannot at all explain it to you; but I
suppose he makes no Secret of it. I wish Mr. GRAVES would finish
his.—And will you really consent to an Exchange of Pictures? Upon my
Word, you make but a sorry Bar∣gain for yourself: however, to give you as
little Reason as may be to regret your Com∣pliance, I will sit to one of
our best Artists; and to supply the Want of Merit in the Ori∣ginal, will
endeavour to give as much as I can to the Copy. If you have any Thing to
suggest on this Subject, (as you seem to hint) you will be so good as
to let me have a Line, because, as soon as I am able to get abroad, which I
hope will be in a few Days, I in∣tend to consult with REYNOLDS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</NOTE> about it. Ay, I forgot
to tell you, that I have been con∣fined this Month with the Gout; every Man has
his D—N; <HI>that</HI> is mine. I am glad your <PB N="106" REF="115"/>
Likeness is a strong one; and I think the Attitude, you are drawn in, is a
good one: pray, is that the Picture you intend for me? The Writer of
<HI>Tristram Shandy</HI> is a Mr. STERNE, one of the Prebendaries of
<HI>York.</HI> As to Mr. BASKERVILLE's <HI>Bible,</HI> he will easily be
dissuaded from the marginal Ornaments; but the Title-Page is a Favourite,
and for my Part, I have not much Objection to it. Mr. WEBB's Book, on
<HI>Painting and Painters,</HI> is reckoned ingenious, and if you like the
Subject, will be worth your Perusal. <HI>Antient and Modern Rome,</HI> I
also think a good Poem. My Compliments to Mr. HYLTON, and all Friends.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday searching for Figures for your two
Niches—I have found three Pair, the Figures good, that will do as to
Size, <HI>viz.</HI> the ANTINOUS I mentioned, and the APOLLO with his Arm over
his Head; a FLORA and a CERES; and a HOMER and VIRGIL. The ANTINOUS and APOLLO
are two Feet high, FLORA and CERES twenty-three Inches, and HOMER and VIRGIL
twenty-one. These last are each of them leaning upon a Pedestal; on one
of which, in <HI>Basso Relievo,</HI> is <HI>Troy</HI> in Flames; on the
other, ROMULUS and REMUS sucking a Wolf. These are both pretty Fi∣gures;
and don't you think them better Or∣naments for a Library, and more suitable
Com∣panions for SAPPHO, than either of the others? A Line by the Return of the
Post, will just give me Time to get which of them you choose 
<PB N="108" REF="117"/> finished, and sent to you, before I set off for
<HI>Nottingham,</HI> for I find I must go thither be∣fore I come to the
<HI>Leasowes</HI>; but I shall stay only a few Days. I had a Letter from
my Friend Mr. M—, by the last Post, who is at <HI>Nottingham,</HI>
and I find him wavering in his Resolutions, about coming by the
<HI>Leasowes.</HI> I am glad you like my Design for the Picture: and how
agreeably you have contrived to flat∣ter me about it! But say what you will,
I shall have a Picture of Mr. SHENSTONE; you will have one only of DODSLEY;
and a SHEN∣STONE by ALCOCK, will certainly be more valuable than a DODSLEY even
by REYNOLDS. I read to him that Part of your Letter which related to him; he
desires his Compliments, and would be glad, if you came to Town, that you
sate to him. I hope I shall be able to send the Picture to you, before I
set out on my Journey; but it is not yet finished.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW much am I obliged to you for the Pains you have taken in
translating LA MOTTE's Discourse on Fable! and though I fancy you will
find, upon comparing the two, that I have made a good Deal of Use of it, I
shall be very glad to have more of it in∣terwoven, if you shall think I
have not suffi∣ciently extracted the Essence of it. I must must own,
my Pride (or call it my Folly, if you please) would rather choose to prefix
some∣what of my own on that Subject, than servilely adopt the Thoughts of a
<HI>Frenchman,</HI> though I acknowledge them to be very ingenious. Be∣sides,
I have had the Hardiness to differ with him in some Respects, which makes
it still more improper to take his whole Discourse. Proceed, therefore,
if you please, in correcting my Essay; and interweave with it as much 
<PB N="110" REF="119"/> more of LA MOTTE as you may think pro∣per. If you defer
this till I come down, which I wish you would not, pray in the mean Time
think of half a Dozen new Fables, that we may not have too much to embarrass
us when together. My Face is quite finished, and I believe very like. I fancy
I shall send it, together with the Figures, on <HI>Monday</HI> Se'en∣night;
but I shall not be able to set out myself till <HI>Monday</HI> Fortnight,
and staying a Week or ten Days at <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Mansfield,</HI>
will detain me from the <HI>Leasowes</HI> till the latter End of next Month.
If the Picture should be turned yellowish, by being packed up, Mr. REYNOLDS
advises, that it be set in the Sun for two Hours, which will quite recover
it. Why did you leave the Choice of your two Figures to me? How could you put
me un∣der such a Difficulty? If I have done wrong, you will suffer for it;
and say what you will, I have not sufficient Firmness of Taste to
di∣rect me right; besides, I do not exactly re∣member the Niches: it is
therefore your Fault to trust me; and if I have erred, your Duty to forgive
me. I have ordered the HOMER and VIRGIL to be bronzed: they are very pretty 
<PB N="111" REF="120"/> Figures; and if you have, as you say, no other
Objection to them, but the Want of two or three Inches more of Height, I hope
some Means may be found to obviate so small a Deficiency. I should not,
however, have ven∣tured to send them, but that you seemed, at last, to
acquiesce in their being sent. I think, however, I have been somewhat
happy in my Urns; and I am not without Hopes, that you will approve the whole
Cargo. The Folio-VIRGIL will come in the same Package. I feel myself very
happy in the Thoughts of seeing you soon, and will hasten the Day as much
as is in my Power. I hope Mr. BAS∣KERVILLE will be quite ready for me; I
shall send him the Paper in a Fortnight. I am</P>

<P>YOUR Picture really affords me many plea∣sing Reflections, and I
have ordered the Frame to be full gilt, whilst I am out of Town, that it may
not give you any unplea∣sing ones. I am going to <HI>Derby</HI> and
<HI>Not∣tingham</HI> for three Weeks or a Month: I can't stay longer, as I
must attend to the Press, having put my Fables in Hand for a new Edition. I
have last <HI>Monday</HI> sent you PERCY's Novel; I sent it unbound, as
we had not Time to bind it: it will not be published till the Beginning of
next Winter. I have sent you the <HI>Fables,</HI> bound in <HI>Morocco,</HI>
and the com∣mon Edition in Boards, for your future Cor∣rections: but I would
not have you begin till you see the next Edition, as I hope you will find it
altered somewhat for the better; I will send you one of them as soon as
it is printed. <PB N="113" REF="122"/> You will find, likewise, in the Parcel,
SOAME JENNYNS's Works, and a Pamphlet or two; also the Fables, with your
Drawings in them, many of which I like extremely; that at the Head of the
second I approve the least: but those that are placed in the Life, I
think should be transferred to the Head and Tail-Pieces of the
Fables—but there will be Time enough to talk of this hereafter. As to
Ita∣lics, I believe I shall steer a middle Course, and make Use only of
a few. I send you a List of some Statues, about the same Size with that
Pair you have; 
<LIST>
<ITEM>DEMOSTHENES and CICERO,</ITEM>
<ITEM>LOCKE and NEWTON,</ITEM>
<ITEM>CHAUCER and SPENCER,</ITEM>
<ITEM>SHAKESPEARE and MILTON.</ITEM>
</LIST> When you have fixed upon which Pair you will have, you will
let me know whether you will have them white or bronzed, and what Kind of a
Bronze.</P>
<P>I really don't know how to appease Mr. W—. I told him, I was
very sorry I had pretended to meddle with his Ode, and begged 
<PB N="114" REF="123"/> his Pardon. He is still unappeased, writes me
another angry Letter, and desires me to give him my Reasons for every
Alteration; this it is impossible for me to do, as I have forgot how it
originally was; and I really think it of very little Consequence, as no Name
ap∣pears to it.</P>
<P>Mr. STUART is just now with me, and de∣sires his Compliments. He
thinks of seeing your Place the latter End of the Summer, and believes the
Attorney-General, Mr. PRATT, will be with him. I have just been struck with
the bad News, that Mr. — has lost his Wife. You will perceive I write

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Mr. HULL, at
<HI>Birmingham.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I DESIRE my Compliments to Mr. HULL and Miss MORRISON, with many
Thanks for the Pleasure I received from last Night's Play.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A hasty and imperfect Compilation of some Scenes, on the
Subject of ROSAMOND, which, however, laid the Ground-Work of the present
Tragedy, acted at <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre. The Public may easily
discern how fully the Author has availed himself of the kind and judicious
Hints contained in the Letter before us.</NOTE> It was, indeed, acted with
great Spirit, and as far as I could judge, afforded the Au∣dience no small
Satisfaction—not, perhaps, equal to what they derived from the Appearance
of the Dun Cow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Introduced in a
Pantomime performed the same Even∣ing.</NOTE> for that is hardly to be
expected.</P>
<P>I think the Play has now so much <HI>good</HI> in it, that it may
be worth Mr. HULL's while <PB N="116" REF="125"/> to give it a few more
finishing Touches. Sup∣pose a Confessor or Friar, either out of Ha∣tred
to the Queen, view to his own Advance∣ment, or any <HI>selfish</HI> Motive
(which he might explain in a short Soliloquy) persuaded ROSA∣MOND to
aspire to the Throne, and to urge the King to a Divorce; that ROSAMOND
should avow her Abhorrence of such Injustice to the Queen, intimating,
that her Love had no other Object than the King's Person and heroic Vir∣tues;
that this Refusal should affront the Friar, who in Revenge should inform
the Queen, that ROSAMOND actually <HI>had</HI> those very Intentions with
which he had been endeavouring to in∣spire her, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This would
throw more Plot into the Play, (which it wants) would more sufficiently
account for the Queen's sudden Change from a mild Character to a revenge∣ful
one, and, as Mr. HULL thinks the Play too short, would add two new Scenes.
Some further Improvements I would recommend in the Close, and a few more
Places; but Mr. HULL's further <HI>Attention</HI> to the Play, will render it
need∣less to point them out to him.</P>
<P>If you should ever complete this Undertak∣ing to your Liking, and
produce the Piece <PB N="117" REF="126"/> on a <HI>London</HI>-Stage, I would
recommend, that you should by all Means give it a double Title in the printed
Bills; namely, HENRY <HI>the Second, or the Fall of</HI> ROSAMOND.</P>
<P>I should esteem it as a Favour, if Mr. HULL would send me down
a Copy of the Prologue and Epilogue as they were spoken; which I will not
communicate without his Permission. Either his or Miss MORRISON's Muse
seems to favour them at a Minute's Warning.</P>
<P>Mr. HODGETTS, with whom I am at pre∣sent, would be glad that Mr.
HULL would dine here, about two; and so should I, if it be no way
inconvenient to him.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot to thank you for the Stanzas you left at the
<HI>Leasowes,</HI> when I was on a Visit to <HI>Hagley.</HI> They are well
con∣structed for the Occasion, and the Idea seems to arise from humane
Sensibility, warmed with honest Indignation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Mr. HULL, at
<HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre, <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 18, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. HULL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I recollect aright, both you and NED ALCOCK were here this last
Autumn, on the Evening when my Fish-Ponds had been robbed, and the Fish
destroyed. You were an Eye-Witness of the Circumstances, there∣fore
cannot but retain them in your Memo∣ry. I find I have been arraigned of
<HI>Lenity,</HI> by several conscientiously-upright Neighbours. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I have screened a Robber from
Justice</HI>;"—"<HI>I have given Encouragement to future Thefts,</HI>"
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Such are the Aspersions wherewith I have 
<PB N="121" REF="130"/> been loaded. I make a material Distinction between a
<HI>Robber</HI> and a <HI>Pilferer</HI>; nor can I assign the former
Appellation to a poor Wretch, who, in his Hunger, has taken two or three
<HI>Fishes,</HI> or as many <HI>Loaves.</HI> It is true, I would rather have
given more than the Value of them, to have prevented my <HI>finny Friends</HI>
being di∣sturbed in, or taken away, from their elemen∣tal Habitation; it is
also as true, that, in my first Warmth, on the Report that the Fellow had
bruised the poor Creatures to Death against the Stumps and Roots of Trees,
I could not only have delivered him over to Justice, but have been almost
induced to become myself his Punisher; but when that Warmth submitted to
cool Reflection, <HI>I felt it impossible</HI> to resist his Argument,
of having a Wife with five Children at Home, and not a Doit to procure them a
Meal. I verily believe too he spoke the Truth. Poverty and Affliction
seemed to work and plead within him, and his Words were the Words of
Nature.</P>
<P>I cannot be so severe against these petty Misdemeanours as
many are; nor can I, though I revere the Call of Justice, be a rigorous 
<PB N="122" REF="131"/> Supporter of its Claims, except in atrocious Cases.
Beside, what had it availed me, to have consigned the Offender to the Power
of a Ma∣gistrate? Rather say, what Pain and Inconve∣nience should I not
have entailed on myself? I should have had the Trouble of attending the
Examination; have had the Fellow impri∣soned many Days; and the additional
Mortifi∣cation of travelling, perhaps to <HI>Warwick,</HI> or
<HI>Worcester,</HI> in order to convict him. And after all, no Restitution
is made for my Loss, though it were ten Times more valuable than a whole
<HI>Draught of Fishes.</HI> There is surely something deficient in our
Laws, concerning the <HI>Meum &amp; Tuum</HI>; the Person robbed not only
abides the Loss without Amends, but is even put to Expence, as well as
Inconvenience, to get the Robber punished.</P>
<P>Then again, the Wife and five Children!—The poor Fellow
subsists, chief Part of the Year, only by carrying News-Papers round the
Country. Had He been shut up, what was to have supported the ragged Family
meanwhile? I am beside inclined to think, that half a Crown, and a little
wholesome Admonition, <PB N="123" REF="132"/> that is, if he be not a
practised and stubborn Offender, might go as far towards amending his
Morals, as an Acquaintance with the In∣side of a Prison, and the
Conversation of such Associates as he might find there.</P>
<P>I have suffered myself sometimes to doubt the Excellence of
our Laws, relative to Life and Death, notwithstanding I know it has been
asserted by many People, that they are wiser than those of any other
Nation. What then? Is the Man who takes a few Guineas from you on the Highway,
on a Level with him who commits a deliberate Murder? And is there no
Punishment to be found more ade∣quate to the first Transgression,
than taking away the Life? Surely, one Example made by a visible Brand, a
Mark of Disgrace, which could never be washed away, would more avail
towards the Prevention of future Crimes, than half the Executions in the
Kingdom, which have now, from two great Frequency, lost the chief Part of
their Purpose and Terror. The Punishment which was inflicted by a Regent in
some Part of the East, (I think the Circum∣stance is related in the
<HI>Arabian Nights Enter∣tainments)</HI> <PB N="124" REF="133"/> on a Judge who
had been induced, by Gold, to give an unjust Decision, is admi∣rable. The
Brand, placed on his Habitation, in legible Characters, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Here lives a corrupt Judge,</HI>"</Q> was, in
the highest Degree, conso∣nant to Justice, inasmuch as it made the
Crime its own Punishment.</P>
<P>I have been led into these Reflections by finding how severely I
have been arraigned, only for having been <HI>an innocent Defrauder of the
Law</HI>: so have troubled you with them; but here I come to a Conclusion.
You are at Liberty to draw what Inferences you please from, or make what
Objections you like to, my Opinion.</P>
<P>I am now to thank you for the Anecdotes you have given me, as well
as for the Peru∣sal of the enclosed Ballad. I am particularly pleased
with the Image, 
<Q> 
<L>"Appear they not as drizling Dews</L> 
<L>Fresh'ning some faded Flower?"</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 26, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. HULL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ESTEEM myself beholden to you, for having made me acquainted
with the Rea∣lity of the two Writers, Dr. LANCASTER and HENRY. I have admired
them both in their Pages, but knew only their Names. In fact, when I first
read the <HI>Essay on Delicacy,</HI> I ima∣gined the Name of LANCASTER to
be ficti∣tious, and that the Work might be the Pro∣duction of the Author of
<HI>Sir Thomas Fitz-Oshorne's Letters.</HI> There is great Spirit, fine
Sentiment, and true Elegance of Style through∣out; and my Friend DODSLEY's
preserving it in his <HI>Fugitive Pieces</HI> is truly meritorious. It well
deserves to be rescued from Oblivion. But what a Pity that your Uncle does
not make a more frequent Use of his Pen! the World does not abound too much
in such Writers. <PB N="133" REF="142"/> How much likewise is it to be
lamented, that a Man of such Abilities should lie concealed in an obscure
Part of <HI>Essex!</HI> He should have remained in the World—that
is, I mean, for the Sake of the World; to his own Happi∣ness, probably,
Retirement was most condu∣cive. It is most certain, that no Men are fit for
Solitude, but those who find the Source of Amusement and Employment in
themselves. Fancy, Reflection, and a Love of Reading, are indispensably
necessary for such a Situation. It is downright Lunacy for a Man who has
pas∣sed his Life in a Compting-House, or a Shop; who possesses,
possibly, but a moderate Share of natural Understanding, that
Understanding too not cultivated by Education, and who has ne∣ver known what
it is was to look into a Book—It is, I repeat, downright Lunacy, for
such a Man to think of <HI>retiring.</HI> He knows not, the Fatigue he is
going to encounter: he will want Employment for his Hours; most pro∣bably,
may shorten his Existence, and while he retains it, it will be one
continued State of Apathy, if not Disorder.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="143"/>HENRY, you say, is a Mr. GRIFFITH, of the
County of <HI>Kilkenny</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> A Friend brought me over the
Letters of HENRY and FRANCES, when they were first published in
<HI>Dublin</HI>; they are most admirably clever and comprehensive; I have
enjoyed and re-enjoyed them; and while I have admired the Wri∣tings, have loved
the Writers. In the private Character you have given me of this amiable
<HI>Pair,</HI> I feel as if I were acquainted with them. Before the Information
received from you, I have sometimes suffered myself to think, and even
communicated to an intimate Friend or two, that there was a Similitude of
Disposition between HENRY and myself; but when I look on your
Description of him, I entertain much Doubt. In the active Parts of his
Philosophy, his Perseverance, and Re∣solution, I fear I am far behind
him. He is a Man qualified for any State or Situation; Business or
Amusement, Solitude or a Crowd.—And you have spent Months with him at
<HI>Kilkenny!</HI>—I give you Joy of such an Hap∣piness.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM greatly obliged both to you and Miss MORRISON, for the
Ballads you were so good as to inclose to me. The Speed you have used in
sending them, testifies the Rea∣lity of that Delight you seemed to
express at the <HI>Leasowes,</HI> when I first communicated my Friend Dr.
PERCY's Design. I sent them di∣rectly <PB N="136" REF="145"/> to him; he has
begun to print off his venerable Collection,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antient Poetry,</HI> now published in three Volumes; the
universal Estimation and Encouragement of which Work, sufficiently
testifies its Excellence.</NOTE> with an Eye to the Publication of it
sometime next Winter. One of your Ballads is truly beautily and extreme∣ly
proper for his Purpose. It has that <HI>Nai∣veté,</HI> which is so
very essential in Ballads of all Kind; and which requires no more than,
that <HI>sublime,</HI> or <HI>elegant,</HI> or <HI>tender</HI> Sentiments be
expressed in a simple and unaffected Manner—<HI>Sentimental</HI>
Language would be no ill Term for it; or, perhaps, the Essay before
DODSLEY's <HI>Fables</HI> does not improperly stile it, the <HI>Voice</HI> of
Sentiment, in Opposition to the <HI>Language</HI> of Reflection.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>other,</HI> Miss M— well di∣stinguishes,
that the Merit of it is almost wholly confined to the Sentiment at last.
This is both <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>tender</HI>; and would <HI>she</HI>
take the Pains to new-write the <HI>whole</HI> on this Ac∣count, (for even this
Sentiment is not <HI>expressed</HI> so very simply as one could wish
it) I dare say it is in her Power to render it very plea∣sing. 
<PB N="137" REF="146"/> I know not how far I am <HI>singular</HI>; but as I
love to avail myself of different Words, to bundle up Ideas in different
Parcels, it is become habitual to me, to call <HI>that</HI> a <HI>Ballad</HI>
which describes or implies some <HI>Action</HI>; on the other Hand, I term
that a <HI>Song,</HI> which contains only an Expression of
<HI>Sentiment.</HI> Ac∣cording to this Account, I believe one of your Pieces
would appear a <HI>Ballad,</HI> and the other a <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Play-House</HI> Coronations answer the Pur∣pose of all
those who chuse to compound the Matter betwixt <HI>Indolence</HI> and
<HI>Curiosity.</HI> Mr. GARRICK has given a very genteel Turn to this Taste
among the Citizens, in his Epilogue to the new Play.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epilogue to the Tragedy of <HI>Hecuba,</HI> produced that Year at
<HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre.</NOTE> I have not <HI>yet</HI> seen this
Performance; and should be glad if you would give me some Account of its
Appearance on the Stage. Why does not <HI>your</HI> Dr. LANCAS∣TER 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Editor's Uncle.</NOTE> compleat
his <HI>Essay upon Delicacy?</HI> I read it, since I wrote last, in
DODSLEY's <HI>Fugitive</HI> <PB N="138" REF="147"/> <HI>Pieces,</HI> and think
it mighty well deserves the Labour necessary to its Continuation.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that Specimens of Wit or Hu∣mour have been dispensed
this Winter but spa∣ringly from the Press; and even there in
<HI>po∣litical</HI> Pamphlets, where I am least inclined to seek them. But
we must swim with the Tide, if we would collect the Shells and Co∣rals that
it leaves behind; accordingly I have read two or three of these Pamphlets
which have answered my Expectations. Should any other appear that strikes
you, be so good as to enclose it to me in a Frank. As to <HI>La∣vinia,</HI>
or other dramatic Schemes, I must de∣fer them till I see you again at the
<HI>Leasowes,</HI> which whenever it happens, will afford me Pleasure,

<HEAD>LETTER XL. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Miss M—.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 8, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Miss M—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I OUGHT to have returned Thanks for your agreeable Account of the
Excursion to <HI>Chepstow,</HI> some Time ago; but these are Du∣ties
which I do not always perform so soon as I ought—you know I
don't—Neither will I waste my Time and Paper in apologizing for a
Failing which you are so ready to forgive, <PB N="144" REF="153"/> convinced
that I am not less grateful on that Account.</P>
<P>I have great Joy in reading these little pleasurable Travels, in
a private Letter, related, as yours are, without Formality, describing, with
Ease and Simplicity, every little Occur∣rence as it falls out. I can journey
with you in Imagination, and partake every trivial Dif∣ficulty and every
Delight. <HI>You</HI> are fond of these little <HI>Parties of
Pleasure,</HI> as they are called, and in you it is, by no Means, reprovable;
but in general, they are very dangerous to young Folks. <HI>You</HI> have Means
and Time, at your own Disposal; your Party is small and select, both in
Point of Reputation and Un∣derstanding; you likewise turn your Excur∣sion
to some Advantage; you make Observa∣tions on all you see, form nice
Distinctions between different Places, Points, and Charac∣ters, and draw
just Conclusions from them—But, as I said before, these Parties
too often are hazardous; the Mind once indulged in them, is apt to covet them
too often; they are sometimes the Means of drawing a Female into improper
Company; they encroach on <PB N="145" REF="154"/> Means and Time, neither of
which, probably, can with Propriety be bestowed; they have their Source in
Dissipation, are continually at∣tended with Hazard, and too often end in
the Worst of Mischiefs. In short, I would wish all young Folks, who
have neither Leisure nor Money at Command, to shut their Ears against the
very Name of <HI>a Party of Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>More than once in my Life, I have been so∣licited by Friends to
visit foreign Climes. I had an Invitation of this Kind lately; but it is now
too late; at least, I think so—Besides, why should a Man go so
far for Objects of Cu∣riosity, who has seen too little of his own Coun∣try?
Many Parts of <HI>England, Wales</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land</HI> equally (I
should think) deserve our Ad∣miration, and we need not risque Winds and
Waves, to which I feel <HI>some</HI> Objection. Num∣bers of our travelling
Gentry peregrinate too early in Life, before the Mind is sufficiently formed
to make proper Observations on what they see and hear.</P>
<P>A Friend once related an Anecdote, which is apposite to my
Subject. A very young <PB N="146" REF="155"/> Man, of good natural
Understanding, and Heir to an affluent Fortune, would needs be one of these
inconsiderate Travellers. In the Course of his Adventures, he fell into
Company, in <HI>Naples,</HI> with some well-travelled, and well-in∣formed
Foreigners. They were conversing on what they had seen in <HI>England</HI>;
and some little Difference in Opinion arising about the Ar∣chitecture of
<HI>Windsor</HI>-Castle, they naturally re∣ferred themselves to the young
<HI>Englishman</HI> for Decision. With much Confusion and Hesita∣tion
he was compelled to confess, he had ne∣ver seen the Building in Question.
The Com∣pany, with true foreign Politeness, only testi∣fied their
Admiration in a silent Smile—but the Reflection instantly struck,
and pained the young Gentleman. The Result was, that he returned for
<HI>England</HI> within two Days, rational∣ly determined to instruct
himself in the Know∣ledge of his own Country, before he pryed in∣to those
afar off. His Reflection and Deter∣mination did equal Credit to his
Understanding.</P>
<P>Our Friend HULL has, as usual, been amu∣sing us with as good a
Drama, as our neigh∣bouring Town can give Encouragement to; 
<PB N="147" REF="156"/> but says, he returns no more. I know many who will be
sorry on this Account. He has not departed, however, without having excited
Curiosity in a very peculiar Way; on a small Plan, indeed, but to a very
commenda∣ble Purpose. He enticed with him his two principal Actresses,
Miss MORRISON and Miss IBBOT, (both possessed of great Merit in
their Profession) some few of his Band, two Voices, and gave an Evening's
Entertainment of <HI>Sing∣ing</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> at the little Town of
<HI>Stour∣bridge,</HI> some few Miles off; the Profits de∣voted to the
Assistance of a Tradesman, who had suffered under repeated
Misfortunes. The Success, I hear, more than answered his Ex∣pectations; the
little Assembly-Room was croud∣ed, and with much good Company. A slight
Cold made me fearful of being out late, but the Particulars were given me by a
neigh∣bouring Clergyman who was present. The Pieces selected for Reading
were well-chosen. I do not remember the whole Number, but I recollect that
<HI>Miss</HI> CARTER<HI>'s Ode to Wisdom,</HI> PRIOR<HI>'s Henry and
Emma,</HI> and GRAY's <HI>Elegy in a Country Church-Yard</HI> were amongst
them. The latter gave particular Satisfaction, my <PB N="148" REF="157"/> Friend
told me, to the Gentlemen of the Pul∣pit, of whom he counted seven. The whole
was received with great Approbation. You are to observe that HULL and his
Party, so far from proposing any Emolument to them∣selves, declined even
to be re-imbursed the Ex∣pences they were at in going, and the Master of
the Assembly-Room <HI>gave</HI> the Use of it. From this confined
Instance of such a Scheme, I am apt to think an Union of Poetry and
Music, executed on a larger Plan, would be an admirable
Two-Hours-Entertainment, either in a public Room or private Family.</P>
<P>I enclose a Piece of Writing, which a Friend of mine sent me in
a Frank last Week. I think the Subject calculated for your Liking. It was
planned, and partly written, in Mr. HOARE's lovely Grounds, at
<HI>Stourton</HI> in <HI>Wilt∣shire</HI>; and the Thought suggested by
survey∣ing, from an Eminence there, a woody Vale, wherein ALFRED is reported
to have once con∣cealed himself from the <HI>Danes.</HI> Send it back, when
you have done with it.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Adieu, dear Miss M—.</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Yours very faithfully, W. SHENSTONE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>CADWAL: A LEGENDARY TALE; IN TWO PARTS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DARK <HI>December</HI> was the Month,</L>
<L>The Air was dank and chill,</L>
<L>When CADWAL's weary Foot had reach'd</L>
<L>The Summit of the Hill,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath whose ample Verge he wont</L>
<L>To labour at the Plough,</L>
<L>And, to relieve his Father's Age,</L>
<L>Bedew his infant Brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="150" REF="159"/>
<L>When eighteen Years had o'er him pass'd,</L>
<L>He left his rustic Home,</L>
<L>(Sore-smote with Grief) in distant Grounds,</L>
<L>And Stranger-Fields to roam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Twelve Winters had his Exile seen,</L>
<L>When lo! his Bosom burns,</L>
<L>Again to clasp his Father's Knees,</L>
<L>And homeward he returns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now descending to the Vale,</L>
<L>With slow and trembling Feet,</L>
<L>At this new Sight, his native Soil,</L>
<L>The Pulses flutt'ring beat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, with penetrating Eye,</L>
<L>He pierces the close Dell,</L>
<L>Where in his Thatch-beshelter'd Cot</L>
<L>His Sire did whilom dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet in his sad and troubled Look,</L>
<L>Such Terror might ye see,</L>
<L>As when we almost wish to shun</L>
<L>The Thing, we wish should be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="151" REF="160"/>
<L>He pryed here, he pryed there,</L>
<L>No Cottage could he spy,</L>
<L>Nor smallest Trace of human Tread</L>
<L>Appeared to his Eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Monarch of the feather'd Brood</L>
<L>Was heard aloud to crow,</L>
<L>Nor laboured Ox the vocal Air</L>
<L>Awaken with his Low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In strange Amazement and Suspense</L>
<L>Awhile benumb'd he stood,</L>
<L>Then fell, despairing on the Earth,</L>
<L>And wept, and wail'd aloud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His bitter Cries an Hermit drew</L>
<L>Forth from his lonely Cell,</L>
<L>Whose plyant Sense was quick to feel</L>
<L>Affliction's poignant Yell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Compassion held him mute at first,</L>
<L>While as he ponder'd him</L>
<L>With fixed Eye, where Nature's Floods</L>
<L>Up-swelled to the Brim;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
<L>Then thus—"My Son, your Plaints I heard,</L>
<L>"They smote me to the Heart;</L>
<L>"To me, without Reserve or Fear,</L>
<L>"The weighty Cause impart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Deep-vers'd in Sorrow's heavy Task</L>
<L>"Full many a weary Hour,</L>
<L>"Right well I know what aggravates,</L>
<L>"And what abates its Pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Close-pent within restraining Bounds,</L>
<L>"The River foams and roars,</L>
<L>"Tumultuous boils with mighty Heaves,</L>
<L>"And wounds its kindred Shores;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The Load remov'd, that choak'd its Course,</L>
<L>"The Violence subsides,</L>
<L>"The Tumult lessens by Degrees,</L>
<L>"And smooth the Current glides.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Give, then, the struggling Griefs to flow,</L>
<L>"Which thy clogg'd Heart oppress,</L>
<L>"Each Word will take a Part away,</L>
<L>"And make the Burthen less."</L>
</LG>

<L><HI>Old</HI> CADWAL <HI>here distraught I
seek,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Here</HI> CADWAL <HI>dwelt of yore,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Here, here, his quiet Cottage rose,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But now is here no more.</HI></L>

<L>"Old CADWAL seek'st thou? Hapless Man!</L>

<L><HI>Did he not deal to all around,</HI></L>

<L><HI>Not ev'n the Sparrow of the Hedge,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But in his Love had Share.</HI></L>

<L>"Ah! how severe the Punishment,</L>

<L>"Inflict a milder Pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Less harshly censure thy Offence,</L>
<L>"(Some youthful Warmth, I ween!)</L>
<L>"And give it to mine Ears in Terms</L>

</LG>
<LG>

<L>"Here on this Bank repose awhile,</L>

<HEAD>CADWAL. PART II.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>OLD</HI> CADWAL <HI>here distraught I
seek</HI>—</L>
<L><HI>Ah, me! this wayward Heart!</HI></L>
<L><HI>That dar'd oppose a Father's Pow'r,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That dar'd his Counsel thwart!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>But</HI> EMMA <HI>'s Charms had won my
Love,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And made it all her own;</HI></L>
<L><HI>I sought not copious Flocks and Meads,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I sought Content alone;</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>And, Oh! so sweetly she conform'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>To all I wish'd or said,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You would have sworn our Hearts, as
Twins,</HI></L>
<L>Were for each other made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="158" REF="167"/>
<L><HI>And was it, holy Father, say,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Was it a Crime to Love;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or to my early-plighted Vows</HI></L>
<L><HI>Unchang'd and steady prove?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MATILDA <HI>'s lofty Friends in Store</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of Fleeces did abound,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And ample Sheaves enrich'd their Fields,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And Orchards rose around;</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>And these Possessions ev'ry Hour</HI></L>
<L><HI>Were pour'd into mine Ear;</HI></L>
<L><HI>To count them o'er, my Father made</HI></L>
<L><HI>His Morn and Ev'ning Care.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Sure if he any Failing had,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Twas too fond Love for me;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hence sprung the Wish, that of her
Flocks</HI></L>
<L><HI>I might the Master be;</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>And as he will'd, and as he bade,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Oh! that I could have done!</HI></L>

Love,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And made it all her own.</HI></L>

<L><HI>Say, Father, ought I, at the Church</HI></L>
<L><HI>Have join'd</HI> MATILDA <HI>'s Hand,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When Love and Truth, that should attend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Were not at my Command?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Her spacious Granaries—to me</HI></L>
<L><HI>They no Allurement were;</HI></L>
<L><HI>My</HI> EMMA <HI>'s low-roof'd Dairy-Hut</HI></L>

<HEAD>LETTER XLI. Mr. M— G— to W. SHENSTONE, Esq. with
<HI>Fragments of Antient Poetry,</HI> printed at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in the
Year 1760.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Edinburgh,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 21, 1760.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me the greatest Pleasure, that I have an Opportunity of
conveying to a Person of your Taste, the inclosed Fragments of an∣tient
<HI>Caledonian</HI> Poesy— 
<Q> 
<L>"Full many a Gem of purest Ray serene,</L> 
<L>"The dark unfathom'd Caves of Ocean bear,</L> 
<L>"Full many a Rose is born to blush unseen,</L> 
<L>"And waste its Sweetness on the desart Air."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See GRAY's <HI>Elegy in a Country Church-Yard.</HI></NOTE></L></Q>
But Thanks to the Taste and Care of the in∣genious Translator, that we have
not to la∣ment the utter Loss of those Pieces, which reflect so much
Lustre on the Memory of the original Bards. Here we see Poets framed by the
Hand of Nature; their Manners rude and <PB N="168" REF="177"/> uncultivated, as
the Wilds they inhabited; unacquainted with ARISTOTLE and HORACE, but pouring
the (I had almost said) involun∣tary Effusions of Minds filled with true
poe∣tic Fire, deeply interested in the Themes they sung, devoid of all
Rules, they attach and warm the Heart, by an amazing though se∣cret Power,
the constant Effect of copying Nature, but copying her justly; to which the
languid Efforts of Art bear scarce so inte∣resting a Proportion, as the
Shadow to the Substance.</P>
<P>From the general Structure of the Poetry, from the Names of the
Persons celebrated in it, and the Hints of the <HI>Costume</HI> scattered
here and there, it would appear, that these Poems were composed about the
Time that the antient Bards of <HI>Iceland,</HI> and the other northern
Countries, made so great a Figure in Poetry; or, perhaps, their Date may
reach back beyond the Time of Christianity being preached in our Islands;
hence it will follow, that our Ancestors were rising by surprising
Efforts to catch the fairest Flowers of <HI>Par∣nassus,</HI> while the
polite Regions of <HI>Europe</HI> re∣sounded <PB N="169" REF="178"/> with
polemic Theology and monkish Nonsense: this becomes the more probable,
when we reflect, that scarce any Trace of Christianity is to be found in
these Pieces, and no Trace of the Names that prevailed after the ninth
Century, instead of which, the Names appear entirely Pagan; and numberless
Hints are taken from the predatory Life our Ancestors (particularly those
of the Islands and north-west Coasts of <HI>Scotland)</HI> led before,
and at the first preaching of the Gospel among them. A critical Examination
of the original Language would help to throw some Light on this Conjecture,
as well as the Publication of Pieces of greater Length, which may follow
these first Specimens. It is not, however, to be doubted, that the many
Fragments still preserved amongst our Highlanders of their an∣tient
Poetry, may be of great Use in settling the History, and ascertaining
the Meaning of several Antiquities dispersed over the moun∣tainous Parts
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> while the Man of Taste must be agreeably
surprised to find a Beauty and Force of Diction, a Warmth of Fancy, a
chaste and truly noble Simplicy united, where hitherto no Person has ever
looked for it. <PB N="170" REF="179"/> If these Specimens are well received by
the Public, and if suitable Encouragement were given to the ingenious
Translator, he would oblige the World with the Translation of the Epic Poem
mentioned in the Preface, which consists of upwards of nine thousand
Lines: but the dependant Situation of a Tutor can∣not afford him Leisure to
undertake so great a Work.</P>
<P>Your Friends in this Corner of the World were much disappointed,
in not having the Happiness of seeing you last Summer along with Lord
LYTTELTON; and without Flattery I can assure, that the Number of your
Friends in <HI>Scotland</HI> is greater than, perhaps, you think of, and every
one of them would be happy to have an Opportunity of seeing and obli∣ging
you. Lord ALEMOOR, Dr. ROEBUCK and his Spouse desire to be remembered; and
I shall take it as a particular Favour, that you would, at a leisure Hour,
write me your Opi∣nion of the inclosed Specimens, and allow me to be with
Esteem, truly, dear Sir,</P>

<P>I KNOW no Way so good of making up for my long Silence to you, as
sending you the enclosed Poem, which if it gives you as much Pleasure as
it did me, you will give me no small Thanks for: it is translated from an
old Highland Poem, by one Mr. M' PHER∣SON, a Minister in the Highlands. There
are great Numbers of these Elegies all over the Highlands, which they sing
to mournful Tunes in the Evening over their Fires. Mr. M' PHER∣SON has, I hear,
translated ten more of them, which I fancy will soon be published; if
they are not, I shall endeavour to get them, and send them to you. It will
be needless to say <PB N="172" REF="181"/> any Thing in Praise of the
Poem, as I think it can sufficiently recommend itself. The Trans∣lation
has a great deal of Merit; I think it is one of the best I ever saw. I
fancy SHEN∣STONE will be much pleased with the Poem, which I shall be
obliged to you if you will present to him with my Compliments.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. R. G—, Esq. to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>June</HI> 16.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear HULL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SAFE arrived in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> after two pleasant
and easy Days Journey, and am now set down to write to you, according to my
Promise, and to note what Alterations or Innovations I had observed upon,
in the Modes and Manners of <HI>London,</HI> since I had not been there so
long before.</P>
<P>This Chapter is reduced to so few Heads, from the several
Conversations we had together in Town, upon the taking down the Signs, the
rooting up the Posts, the paving and lighting of <HI>Oxford-Road, Holborn,
Monmouth-Street,</HI> and <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s, the constructing of
<HI>Black-Friars-Bridge, &amp;c.</HI> that I cannot recollect any other Remark
I made worth mentioning, at present, except the introducing of Asses in
the City, for the Use of Milkmen, Fruiterers, Hawkers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="193"/>This I thought a great Improvement, as it
serves to lessen the Number of Barrows that used to interrupt Walkers
on the broad Pave∣ments; but this Consideration was damped again at seeing
the barbarous Treatment these poor Animals often suffer from their brutal
Guides or Riders. I often thought of STERNE upon these Occasions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Passage about an Ass in his <HI>Sentimental
Journey.</HI></NOTE> An Ass is a dull, slow Creature, that will not mend
its Pace for Whip or Spur—This these Wretches call
<HI>Obstinacy,</HI> and so punish it for a Defect of Nature, as they
would for a moral Vice: for if they reason at all, you may be sure they
reason thus, because it is wrong.</P>
<P>This has renewed a Reflection in my Mind, that has often occurred to
me before, upon the unaccountable Disposition towards Cruelty exercised
against the Brute-Creation, which is too frequently observed among the
general Classes of Mankind, who have not been re∣strained by natural
Sentiment, or refined by a liberal Education.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="194"/>If Sympathy, as modern Philosophers
assert, be the ultimate Cause of our being affected for others, that of
Pain, one would think, should be the strongest. All Men do not feel
Misfortunes, or suffer Grief, alike. One Per∣son may resent a
Mortification, or a Loss, to Madness; while his more temperate Friend can
afford his Pity or Compassion no higher or further than his own
Passions or Sentiments would have extended in the same Circumstances.
Here Sympathy is at an End. But all Per∣sons and Animals too are alike
sensible of Pain—<HI>Ergo</HI>—</P>
<P>We have from hence Reason to conclude, that 'tis more from Want of
Thought, than of Humanity, that the contrary is so apparent; and this
Argument, I think, is fully proved by the Observation, that Children and
Fools are the most guilty of it.</P>
<P>Besides which, there is a great deal in Cus∣tom, that may take
off from the natural Feel∣ings of Compassion, with Regard to the
Brute-Creation, among Numbers of People, such as <PB N="186" REF="195"/>
Butchers, Surgeons, Soldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Fish∣woman being reprehended
for the Barbarity of fleaing Eels alive, answered, that it was no Cruelty,
<HI>as they were so much used to it</HI>; which was plainly transferring
the Insensibility she had herself acquired, through Habit, to the poor
suf∣fering Reptile. This puts me in Mind of the Blunder of an
<HI>Irish</HI> Parliament once, that framed an Act to punish Forgery with
the Loss of both Ears, and so <HI>toties quoties.</HI></P>
<P>There is also, I apprehend, a Sort of No∣tion resting in
uninstructed Minds, that Mo∣rality has nothing to do with our Actions
to∣wards Brutes, any more than it has with Re∣gard to inanimate Nature; so
that many Folks, from such a strange Misconception, torture an Animal
with as little Remorse as they would lop off the Branch of a Tree. Such
People must never have read the Sentence of SOLO∣MON, that <HI>a good Man is
merciful to his Beast</HI>; nor that of SHAKESPEARE, 
<Q> 
<L>"The poor Beetle that we tread upon,</L> 
<L>"In corp'ral Suff'rance feels a Pang as great</L> 
<L>"As when a Giant dies."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="196"/>I remember I was once sitting with a Friend,
and seeing his Son tormenting a poor Dog, by making him suffer great Pain,
I spake to the Father, to reprove him for it; to which he coolly answered,
that as he designed the Boy for the Army, he did not care to inspire him
with too tender Feelings. 
<Q REND="inline">"Your Idea might not be much amiss,"</Q> I
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"if you meant to breed him a Butcher, or a
Hangman."</Q> What a Gothic Notion, that Bravery and Hu∣manity were
incompatible!</P>
<P>OVID seems to have been of my Opinion in the above Reproof, by
making Priests, who were the first Butchers, or Sacrificers, to have led
the Way to Cruelty and Slaughter—
<Q> 
<L>Primoque a caede Ferarum</L> 
<L>Incaluisse putem maculatum sanguine Ferrum.</L></Q> I will
not say, however, that this may be the Reason why Parsons and Butchers
are equally excluded from being on Juries of Life and Death, because there
would be a Sort of <HI>pert Dulness</HI> in the Remark—Asking Pardon
for the <PB N="188" REF="197"/> Tautology—No; the true Reason for
these Exclusions is, that the latter are rendered cal∣lous, from being too
familiar with Slaughter; and with Regard to the former, that the Mini∣sters
of Peace should keep clear of Blood.</P>
<P>A Thought has just occurred to me. I have not Leisure both to
examine and to write it too, so I shall only sport it for the present.
Perhaps, the Injunction in the Levitical Law, to abstain from Blood, might
not have been meant in Derogation of <HI>Black-Puddings</HI> in the least,
but only as a figurative Manner of re∣peating the Sixth Commandment, 
<Q REND="inline">"Thou shalt do no Murder."</Q></P>
<P>A Comment upon the Inhibition of PYTHA∣GORAS, <HI>Abstine à
Fabis,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abstain from Beans.</NOTE> has hinted
this No∣tion to me; for the learned BACON, which Name, you know, accords very
well with <HI>Beans,</HI> says, that what the Sage intended by the
Pro∣hibition was, to forbid meddling with the Con∣tentions and Strife of
Electioneering, where the Votes or Suffrages were given, <HI>pro</HI> and
<HI>con,</HI> by black and white Beans.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="198"/>And this Interpretation ought certainly to
appear the true Sense of the Precept, from this Consideration; for as that
Philosopher had before restricted his Disciples from the Use of all
animal Food, on Account of the transmi∣gratory Notions he had picked up in

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV. Mrs. — to Mr. HULL, of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>
Theatre.</HEAD>
<P>THE great Respect you, Sir, have shewn to Mr. SHENSTONE, in
dedicating your Tragedy of ROSAMOND to his Memory, added to the Pleasure I
have received from some of your other Publications, will, I trust, plead an
Excuse for an Intrusion from a Stranger, and especially as it is to beg
your Acceptance of the enclosed Poem; it was written by that Friend whose
Death you so feelingly lament; it has been in my Possession ever
since, or before that Period: of its Merits I am no Judge; but from its
Author, should imagine it not destitute, and have long regretted its
remaining in Hands so little capable of mak∣ing it appear as it ought. The
sincere Plea∣sure I received, in seeing Mr. SHENSTONE's Name so
respectfully and publickly revived, induced me to wish to make the Author
some Acknowledgment, and this appears to be the <PB N="191" REF="200"/> only
Way; for should not the <HI>Diamond</HI> have Brilliancy enough for the
Public, yet it may not be an unwelcome Amusement to a private Friend, to
remove the Dimness.</P>
<P>I should much sooner have made this Ac∣knowledgment, but from a
Diffidence of its being accepted; however, I hope the best, and that you will
be kind enough to accept it as it is meant. Should it prove worthy of No∣tice,
and acceptable to so partial a Friend, I shall hope, (as I have no Copy) to
receive your Opinion; and must request it as a par∣ticular Favour, that to
any Friend you chuse to shew it, my Name may not be mentioned; on that
Account I decline saying any Thing of myself. My Address is,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Permit me to hope you will excuse the Er∣rors of a weak Pen, and
believe me, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your obliged humble Servant, M. —.</SIGNED>

<L>CUPID o'er human Breasts resistless reigns,</L>

<L>His Passion lasting, when his Hopes were
flown;</L>
<L>MYRTILLO, fram'd to make e'en Toasts adore,</L>
<L>And blest by Fortune much, by Nature more;</L>
<L>Swift o'er the Spinnet-Keys his Fingers flew,</L>
<L>And, Love except, to quell each Passion knew.</L>
<L>Such human Art, with Joy APOLLO view'd,</L>

<L>That deck'd his Words, or sparkled in his Face,</L>
<L>Endear'd his Person, or his Thoughts refin'd,</L>
<L>The Nymph alone, he lov'd, alone was blind.</L>
<L>Each other Belle the slighted Charms admir'd,</L>
<L>Each other Belle the slighted Heart desir'd;</L>
<L>With practis'd Airs they strove to please the

<L>No bright enamour'd Fair could e'er incline</L>
<L>The Heart LAMIRA fir'd without Design.</L>

<L>Where cou'd he fly? From whence his An∣guish

<L>And Solitude and Sounds, with Love conspir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To CUPID thus, while Music's tuneful Aid</L>
<L>Sadden'd each Note, the Boy in Anguish pray'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Harmonious Pow'r! Accept these mournful Strains,</L>
<L>"Reward my Passion, or remove my Pains;</L>
<L>"If e'er thy Praise with early Care I sing,</L>

known,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>APOLLO heard, and list'ning to his Grief,</L>
<L>Sent MAIA's nimble Son to bring Relief;</L>
<L>His Message known, he cleaves the yielding
Skies,</L>
<L>And quick as Light'ning to the Suppliant flies;</L>
<L>Ruffled with Winds, he shakes his azure Plumes,</L>
<L>And round the Place diffus'd divine Perfumes;</L>
<L>Then thus begins—"MYRTILLO cease to grieve,</L>
<L>"And from the <HI>Delphian</HI> Pow'r these Notes
re∣ceive;</L>

<L>She shun'd no Virtue, tho' she sought no
Praise,</L>
<L>And pass'd in quiet unexpos'd her Days;</L>
<L>Much had she heard the various Toils that wait</L>
<L>The Pride of Riches, and the Pomp of State;</L>
<L>Much her fond Mother taught, with pious Care,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fresh Charms adorn'd her, as more Years she
knew,</L>
<L N="100">Her Fame extended as her Beauties grew;</L>
<L>A rigid Sternness all her Beauties arm'd,</L>

<L>The opening Rose shone in her Cheeks refin'd,</L>

<LG>
<L>The wond'ring Prince receiv'd at length her Fame,</L>
<L>And to the Court convey'd th' unwilling Dame;</L>
<L>Th' unwilling Dame to please he vainly strove,</L>
<L>Too soon she rais'd, but ne'er return'd his
Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here long she shone untainted and the same,</L>

Fame;</L>

<L>APOLLO burn'd—But since the Fair cou'd prove</L>

<L>Bright azure Pastures, deep impervious Shades,</L>
<L>Deserving Swains, and not ingrateful Maids;</L>
<L>Beneath a clouded Beach a Shepherd lay,</L>
<L>And with blue Fingers play'd, or seem'd to play,</L>
<L>The gen'rous Nymphs forsook the neighb'ring

<L>But when she spake, all Merit left the Place!</L>

<L>There, blending Vice with Virtue, Truth with Lies,</L>
<L>Left not one Virgin to adorn the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She told why Deities admire Perfumes,</L>

<L>What Muse forgot her Eye-brow Box she shew'd,</L>
<L>And why AURORA's Face with Crimson glow'd;</L>

<L>And JUNO's Toilette shone with Floods of Paint;</L>

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. Mrs. W— to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<P>PERMIT me, Sir, to assure you, that to me your Manner of
receiving what I thought only a due Acknowledgment to your disinterested
Friendship, more than even ac∣quits a real Obligation, as well as gives me a
sincere Pleasure in reflecting, that what I esteem'd is at last in the
Hands of one who will equally value its intrinsic Worth, and is so much
more capable of introducing it proper∣ly to the public Inspection; such I
imagine is your Intention, and I most willingly receive the Favour you offer,
of letting me know your Determination; for why may I not look upon the Friend
of a Gentleman, whose Me∣mory I esteem, in the Number of my own? Give me
leave so to do, and as such to pre∣sent the Compliments of the Season
to you and Mrs. HULL, with cordial Wishes for your seeing many happy
Returns.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221"/>The Manner of the <HI>Diamond</HI> is
similar to the Poem you mention;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">POPE's <HI>Rape of

Truth, I give the former the Preference, even against POPE, and this
because I think there is greater Deli∣cacy of Sentiment: but what else
could be ex∣pected from a Mind, the Characteristics of which were refined
Sensibility, and unbounded Bene∣volence? Though, as I cannot express more
than I believe you think, I will stop my Pen, by saying, that I trust you
will allow your own Wish, relative to the <HI>Snuff-Box,</HI> as a Plea for
my so soon troubling you with another Letter, and that I remain, with due

<P>P. S. I thank you for the two Inscriptions to the Memory of our
amiable Friend. They would have been agreeable Companions to some of the
same Turn already printed at the End of his Works, by Mr. DODSLEY. That which
was wrote by CUNNINGHAM is possessed of genuine Elegance and
Sensibility. I dare say you think so. Those you have sent, affect me
in the same Manner; particularly the <HI>Prose</HI>-Tribute, which you tell
me came from a fe∣male Pen. I think I can guess the Writer, and would, when
next I see her, challenge a Confession, were I sure I could do it
with∣out wounding her Delicacy of Feeling.</P>
<P>The Elegy I also admire much. The Thoughts of the Author are
equally tender and benevolent with those of the Friend, whose Memory he
so pathetically laments. The last Lines of the second Stanza particularly
please me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVI. R. G—, Esq. to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your Letter, and it has astonished me, that you can
be in the least Degree hurt by the Opinion of narrow Minds. With Regard to
the Grievance you complain of; let it be always a Matter of Consolation to
you, that the illiberal Treatment Actors may some∣times meet with, on Account
of their Profession, can never proceed from any but illiberal Minds; 'tis
the Censurers themselves who become Objects of Contempt, when they would
render you so, <HI>from that Consideration merely:</HI> and this
Reflec∣tion ought therefore to make you as indifferent to such Instances of
Ignorance and Ill-breed∣ing, <PB N="219" REF="226"/> as you would be to a
<HI>Billingsgate</HI> Scold, or a St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Abuse.</P>
<P>An Actor is a respectable Character, while he properly
considers, and endeavours to preserve the original Design of his
Profession; and I have ever been of Opinion, and am convinced of the Truth
of the Maxim, that acting should unques∣tionably be accepted among the
Liberal Arts, even with this Advantage over Poetry and Pain∣ting, that it
superadds Example to Document and Delight. 'Tis the <HI>living Moral,</HI>
while the others are but the <HI>dead Letter.</HI> The Stage is a School, and
may be an useful one too—As such it was patronized and cherished by
the wisest and most virtuous States of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI>;
and it has been the Fault of Managers, not of Actors, when∣ever Theatres have
ceased to afford either Pre∣cept or Example.</P>
<P>There are so many Requisites of Talents, Assiduity, and
Person, to form a complete Actor, that even a moderate Degree of Ex∣cellence
should be deemed sufficient Merit to entitle a Performer to the public
Favour and Indulgence: to which, if an honest, decent <PB N="220" REF="227"/>
and unexceptionable Repute be joined, I can see no Sort of Reason, in the
Nature or Di∣stinction of Things, why the <HI>Sock and Buskin</HI> should
not be admitted <HI>ad eundem</HI> with the <HI>Goif and Cowl</HI>; so that
it must be the <HI>per∣sonal</HI> Character, and not the <HI>Dramatis
Personae,</HI> that can ever debase your Profession; in which
Predicament, both the Parson and the Lawyer stand equally with you.</P>
<P>But, indeed, the World, that illiberal Part of it which you hint at,
are apt to consider us Au∣thors, also, in the same inferior Light they do
Actors. I remember a Friend of mine, some∣time ago, was cast off by his
Father, for having published a very ingenious Poem, while he was a Student at
the Temple; and another Acquaintance was severely reproved by his Re∣lations,
for having married a Lady, every other Way worthy of his Choice, <HI>because
she had written a Book.</HI></P>
<P>Such curious Censors, I suppose, would de∣spise the
Meanness of my Spirit now, if I should declare to them, that I would rather
have been HOMER or VIRGIL, than ALEX∣ANDER <PB N="221" REF="228"/> or AUGUSTUS;
and ROSCIUS the Ac∣tor, than the Tribune of the same Name; though the latter
was a Sort of Manager, as may be proved by his having framed the <HI>Lex
Roscia,</HI> for the Regulation of the Theatre at <HI>Rome.</HI> But it might
possibly reconcile them to me again, if I should confess this common
Foible of human Nature, at the same Time, that fond as I am of Fame, I would
yet rather be even what I am myself <HI>now,</HI> than the best of them all
<HI>then.</HI> This is some Sort of Qua∣lification to the former
Sentiment.</P>
<P>I shall here conclude my Letter to you, with intreating, that you
will continue to de∣feat the Malice of such ignorant Censors, by an uniform
Attention to the Spirit and Utility of that <HI>Walk</HI> in Life, which either
Fortune, or your own Choice, has led you into. Elevate your Crest; take
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for your Motto, and study the
following Lines which this Subject has just brought to my Mind.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you undertook to be the Ama∣nuensis, as well as the
Receiver-Gene∣ral to the agreeable Society I have left with so much Regret, I
remember you charged me to write as soon as I should reach this Place; I
accordingly begin my Task, and am very happy to have an Opportunity of
writing to you a good long Letter, without the Expence of Postage, which I
have not the Vanity to sup∣pose my Epistles deserve; I send this by a
pretty Sort of Man, whose Name is —, and who, I should suppose,
has some strong Attachment in your County, which induces him to take so
long a Journey at this rude Season of the Year.</P>
<P>We were very fortunate in Weather, and found the Roads as good as
the Nature of the <PB N="224" REF="231"/> Country will allow them to be. Some
Parts of <HI>Savoy</HI> is frightfully wild and dreary, other Parts very
romantic and beautiful. I was vast∣ly amused with the Manner of
crossing Mount <HI>Cenis:</HI> the Chair we are carried in, or rather
<HI>on,</HI> resemble a good deal a <HI>Chinese</HI> Palanquin, only they
want a Canopy over them; the Chairmen are certainly the best in the World, or
it would be both dangerous and frightful; it seems to me, that they have the
Strength of Mules, and the Agility of Goats, for they run down the Precipices,
and bound from Rock to Rock, in a most astonishing Manner. The Ascent
of the Mountain is three Miles, on the Side of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Plain on the
Top, six Miles in Length, and the Descent on the <HI>Turin</HI> Side, six
Miles more; we had four Men to each of the Ladies' Chairs, and six to the
Gentlemen's, and after carrying us these fifteen dreadful Miles, they were
quite delighted that our Party took them on from <HI>Novalese</HI> (a small
Town at the Foot of Mount <HI>Cenis)</HI> to <HI>Susa,</HI> which is nine
Miles further, and they carried us the last three Leagues in an Hour and a
Half, laughing and jesting with each other all the Way, as if they had been
doing a Thing <PB N="225" REF="232"/> merely for Sport and Amusement; so you
see, my dear Sir, how visible the Goodness of Pro∣vidence is to all
Creatures; these poor Souls, who spend all their Lives in the utmost
In∣digence, and inhabit a Country that seems only fit for Savages, if they
are denied the Luxu∣ries of Life, are amply repaid, in the Enjoy∣ment of a
double Portion of Health and Strength.</P>
<P>We stopped a few Days at <HI>Lyons, Turin, Milan</HI> and
<HI>Verona,</HI> and saw every Thing wor∣thy a Stranger's Curiosity, in
each of these fine Cities; nothing amused me more, than seeing a Parcel
of <HI>Angels</HI> walking about the Streets of <HI>Milan,</HI> they were fine
Cherry-cheek'd Boys, ready dressed for a grand Procession that was
preparing for the Day following, in Ho∣nour of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI>'s
Birth-Day. <HI>Venice</HI> is a very magnificent Place, and possesses
the Charm of Novelty in a much higher Degree than any of the other Places I
have named; 'tis impossible to give a stronger Idea of it, 'tis in a
Stile so peculiar to itself. The Mask∣ing is begun, which is extremely
entertaining: I should be excessively happy to pop in amongst 
<PB N="226" REF="233"/> your dear Society some Day, when you are all
as∣sembled; I assure you, it would be no small Surprize to see me
in a <HI>Venetian</HI> Dress; it consists of a long black silk Cloak,
called here a <HI>Tabora,</HI> a <HI>Baouta,</HI> which is made of black Lace,
three Quarters of a Yard long, and five Times as wide, and hangs about the
Shoul∣ders like a Petticoat; it has a Hood to it, which, when you choose to
be concealed, covers the bottom Part of the Face to the upper Lip, the rest
is hid by a white Mask, and the Women wear on their Heads a Man's Hat
smartly cocked; the <HI>Venetian</HI> Women, who are rather masculine in
their Manner, look still more so in this Dress.</P>
<P>We have had the Prince of <HI>Brunswick</HI> here for ten Days,
which made the Town all alive. I will describe to you one of the
Entertain∣ments made for him, and that will serve as a Specimen of all the
Rest. Our Resident had not got then into his Palace, (as it is justly
called, for it is indeed a noble one) so that he could not make any
Entertainments for the Prince, but he gave him some excellent Mu∣sic one
Morning in a private Manner, which <PB N="227" REF="234" MS="y"/> he seemed to
enjoy the more for being so. The Night after his Highness's Arrival, Count
DURAZZO, the Imperial Ambassador, invited all the <HI>English,</HI> the
foreign Nobility that don't belong to <HI>Venice,</HI> and all the foreign
Ministers, to meet the Prince at Supper. The Ambassa∣dress received her
Guests with mingled Grace and Dignity, she is really a fine Woman, and her
Beauty was heightened by all the Elegance of Dress; soon after the Company
were as∣sembled, a most delightful Serenade began upon the Water, which
was not only delightful to the Ear, but formed a very beautiful Object to the
Sight, for the Musicians were placed in a large open Barge finely
illuminated; the Har∣mony drew around them an infinite Number of Gondolas
belonging to the noble Venetians, who could no otherwise partake of this
Feast; for by their Laws they are secluded from all Commerce with Strangers
that are in a public Character. At proper Intervals of the Music, all Sorts
of Refreshments, of Ices, Fruits, Sweat-meats, Lemonades, <HI>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</HI> were presented to the Company, who, when they had listened to
the Serenade for some Time, changed the Scene, either sat down to Cards, or
formed little chat∣ting <PB N="228" REF="235"/> Parties. When the Card-Tables
broke up, a very elegant Concert, composed of a few choice Pieces of Music,
performed by the very best Hands, agreeably filled up Time, till a most
magnificent Supper was served. When the Company rose from Table, Coffee was
brought, which is the Custom here after Supper, as well as after Dinner; when
this was over, a superb Barge attended, in which the Prince, and all the
Ladies, and a suitable Number of Gentlemen were placed, and rowed to St.
<HI>Mark's</HI> (which is the only public Place here for walking) followed by
the Music, the rest of the Company in their Gondolas, and those of the
noble <HI>Venetians</HI> which the Harmony had attracted. After walking for
some Time to enjoy the cool Air, the Company retired to a very elegant
Apartment, which the Am∣bassadress has on the Place of St. <HI>Mark,</HI>
where she receives her Company, when she chuses to be in private. When we
had chatted here for Half an Hour, it was found to be a proper Time to retire,
as it was three o'Clock in the Morning; and so ended this agreeable Even,
every Part of which was employed in some innocent Amuse∣ment, without any
Thing being hurried or con∣fused. <PB N="229" REF="236"/> I have been the more
particular in this Account, that you may see, my good Friend, that Taste
and Elegance is no more wanting in <HI>Venice,</HI> than it is in the gay
Metropolis of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I hope you will soon indulge me with a Letter, and that it will
bring me a good Account of yourself, and every worthy Indi∣vidual of our
Friends in Friendship assembled; send it in a Frank to Mr. L—, in
— Street, <HI>London,</HI> and he will put it in his Ex∣cellency's
Packet: it must be but a single Letter, but I hope it will contain a good
deal. I long to hear that your good Mother is well re-established in her
Health, she is a worthy Soul, and one cannot help wishing such People to
live for ever; I hope, my dear Friend, though such a cruel Distance divides
us, that I am not esteemed the less a Member of the friendly Society, than
if I was with you; I find the same Warmth of Affection towards the happy
Circle, as if I was not an <HI>Absen∣tee,</HI> therefore beg you will give my
best Af∣fections to all the happy Members.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="237"/>I went the other Day to see the Ceremony of
a Nun taking the last Veil, and 'tis very awful and melancholy, and, to
speak honestly and unprudishly, does not inspire me with the least
Desire to be a Nun: first, the divine Service is performed with very fine
Music, both vocal and instrumental, in the Church of the Convent; then a
little Door is opened in the Grate of the private Chapel, before which the Nun
is seated on a Chair of State under a Canopy, with a Prayer-Book in her Hand,
till the Service is finished; she then comes forward, and kneeling at the
Grate, repeats to a Priest the Vows of the Order, and promises Obedience to
the Abbess; she then rises, and the Nuns take off her white Veil, and put
on a black one, after which she kneels and says some Prayers: then six
of the Sisters advance, and hold over her a purple Pall, whilst Part of the
Funeral-Service is read, during which Time she is supposed to be
<HI>dead</HI>; they then take away the purple Cloth, and the Abbess places on
her Head a Crown richly ornamented with Jewels, to signify that she dies to
the World and rises again to Glory; she then receives <PB N="231" REF="238"/> from the Priest a Tablet, with the Rules of the Order, which she
reads over and kisses; then, with the Tablet in one Hand, and a long wax
Taper, ornamented with Wreaths of Flow∣ers, in the other, she walks slowly
round the Chapel, followed by the rest of the Nuns, and deposits the Tablet
on the Altar. Thus ends the melancholy Ceremony. This young Lady was very
pretty, and not above seventeen; we all thought she had an Appearance of
great Constraint in her Chearfulness, but we were assured, it was
entirely her Choice, that she had a large Fortune, had buried her Father, and
was Mistress of herself; perhaps it may be the Taste of the Family, for
another Sis∣ter professed last Year in the same Convent.</P>
<P>As we are but just got to our new Habi∣tation, you will easily
suppose nobody is idle the House, however I was determined I would not
lose so fair an Opportunity of writing to you, so hope you will excuse
so vile a Scrawl, and believe me, when I assure you, there is nothing
more true, than that I am, my good Sir, ever most sincerely and
affectionately yours and the Society's,</P>

<P>MAY every Blessing of this chearful Sea∣son await you, and
every Individual of the happy Family and Friends you are with! May your
Pleasures be unmixed with Pain, and your Years numerous and
happy!—Re∣ceive these fervent Wishes of an exiled Mem∣ber of your
worthy Society, and be assured, that though you are all Absent from my
Sight, you are ever present to my Mind. I wrote you a long Letter, near three
Months ago, by an <HI>Irish</HI> Gentleman, who assured me, he should
be in your Part of the World as soon as the Post; when lo, and behold!
three Weeks ago I heard of him at <HI>Sienna,</HI> where, I sup∣pose, he
will stay the Winter; therefore, as I am quite in the Dark, in Regard to the
Fate of my unfortunate Epistle, I could not be easy till I had again set
Pen to Paper, <PB N="233" REF="240"/> to request you will all continue to love
me as I do you, which I assure you, my dear Sir, is with undiminished
Truth. I believe I told you in my last, how to forward a Letter to me, but
for fear you have never received it, I will repeat it; if you can send it to
any Friend in <HI>London,</HI> and get them to forward it by the Penny Post
to Mr. L—, in — Street, he will enclose it in the Secretary of
State's Packet, by which Means, I shall be more certain of getting it safe,
than by the Post, as well as that I shall receive it free.</P>
<P>I have a great Favour, my dear Sir, to beg of you, which is, that
you will procure me a Piece of Information for the Use of our Resident, in
Regard to a young Gentleman who has been at <HI>Venice</HI> for some Time,
and seems in no Hurry to leave it, owing, as we imagine, to an Attachment to
a fair <HI>Venetian</HI> Lady; his Name is —, his Family, he says, is
settled near <HI>F—</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire</HI>; he makes a
genteel Appearance in Point of Fortune, and seems to be a modest, pretty
behaved young Man, upon which Account, his Excel∣lency wishes to shew him
any Civility in his <PB N="234" REF="241"/> Power; but, at the same Time,
would be glad to be rightly informed, as to his Character and Family, before he
receives him in an in∣timate Manner. I thought it was very pro∣bable, Mr.
D— might know his Father. I have some Notion, I have heard the Name
mentioned at Mr. B—'s; if, my dear Sir, you can procure me a particular
Account of this young Hero, I shall esteem it as a great Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>I am become wonderfully fond of the mas∣quing Dress, and am
told, I wear it just as well as a <HI>Venetian</HI>; 'tis the most
comfortable, warm, Walking-Dress that can be conceived; I have kept House
these last nine Days, be∣cause it was prohibited, but to-morrow
Mas∣quing begins again, and continues till Lent. I am told we had an
Earthquake, but, thank God, I did not perceive it: since that, there had been
very tempestuous Weather, and vio∣lent Snow and Rain, which, added to a high
Tide, overflowed all the Canals, and I can't but say, at that Time
<HI>Venice</HI> gave me a strong Idea of the universal Deluge.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242"/>There have been five Theatres open till within
these nine Days, and I am told, in the Carnival there will be no less than
seven. The comic Opera was very pleasing, in Point of Music, and always
crouded; but the serious Opera nobody could bear, though MANZOLI sung in
it, and TIBALDI, who is reckoned one of the best tenor Voices, if not the
very best, now living. By this you will perceive how the <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Italian</HI> Taste for Music differs; though I must say, I
believe the great∣est Admirers of MANZOLI would allow he is much altered for
the worse; for my own Part, had I not remembered his Person, I should not
have had the least Recollection of him from his Voice. The Theatre, he
performed at, was entirely fitted up with Glass, both the Stage and all the
Boxes, which, when well lighted, had a fine Effect. There was a Change of the
Scenes for one of the Dances, that was, I think one of the most beautiful
Things I ever beheld.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian</HI> Comedy does not delight me much, for I do not
understand the Language <PB N="236" REF="243"/> well enough yet, to be
amused with the <HI>Bon∣mots</HI> of HARLEQUIN, and to laugh at him because
he has a black Face, and at PAN∣TALOON, merely for having a long Beard; it is
not what I feel myself much disposed to do. I understand the
<HI>Italian</HI> Tragedies better than the Comedies, but I find the Actors
in∣finitely below ours. I intend to be very stu∣dious, and when all the
Family are gadding to the Opera and the Play, I shall sit at home and
drudge at the <HI>Italian,</HI> and this for many good Reasons, but chiefly
to acquit my∣self of my chief Promise to you.</P>
<P>We have, at present, a second Edition of the Prince of
<HI>Brunswick,</HI> who has been at <HI>Ve∣nice</HI> a Week, but on
<HI>Monday</HI> next he leaves us entirely. This Time he has spent most of
his leisure Hours with our Resident, and expresses great Pleasure in
being received on an intimate and easy Footing; he is really a very
sensible and agreeable Man, and as far as can be judged from outward
Appearance, is very amiable: he has with him two young <HI>German</HI> Barons,
who are also very pretty Kind <PB N="237" REF="244"/> of Men, and speak
<HI>English</HI> so well, that it is a Comfort to hear them.</P>
<P>My Brother desires me to present his best Respects to you,
and I hope my dear nominal Uncle will always be mindful to say for me to the
dear Society every Thing that is kind, grateful, and affectionate.</P>
<P>My Vanity will not suffer me to pass over in Silence a
Conquest that I am told I have certainly made, of an <HI>Italian</HI> Count,
who is here in a public Character; he is not quite sixty, his Figure and
Complexion exactly re∣sembles a very bad, long, thin Tallow-Candle; he is
much bedaubed with <HI>Spanish</HI> Snuff, and on meagre Days so overcomes
one with Gar∣lick, that it is dreadful; except these little Accidents, he is
a most agreeable Companion, for he is very sensible, very religious, very
philosophic, extremely polite, and his Conver∣sation is both instructive
and amusing. Now, my good Friend, from the Picture I have drawn, would you
not think I was in some Danger of losing my Heart, but that luckily 
<PB N="238" REF="245"/> my amiable Count is a bigotted Roman Ca∣tholic, and I an
obstinate <HI>Heretick?</HI></P>
<P>We may give ourselves what Airs we please about our
<HI>English</HI> Liberty, but for the <HI>Ladies, Italy</HI> is undoubtedly
the Land of perfect Free∣dom; to all public Places, they constantly go in
Pairs, with their <HI>Cavalier Serventes,</HI> and put me much in Mind of the
<HI>clean</HI> and <HI>unclean</HI> Beasts going into the Ark. What would
be∣come of the Reputation of a miserable <HI>English</HI> Woman, if she
was to go to the Play with a Man <HI>tête-à-tête?</HI> And
yet that is constantly done here without Imputation of Wrong—In
short, if a Woman has any Mind to be wicked, <HI>Venice</HI> seems to be
the last Place in the World to give her better Sentiments.</P>
<P>How delighted should I be to surprize the dear Society, some
Night or other, when you are over your sober Game of Quadrille, in my white
Masque and Man's Hat; you have no Notion with what an Air I have learnt to
put it over my right Eye. I will not de∣spair but that we may again meet
happily under that hospitable Roof, where for some <PB N="239" REF="246"/>
Weeks, in the Enjoyment of such friendly Conversation, I tasted more real
Happiness and Peace than I ever experienced <HI>before</HI> or
<HI>since</HI> in my whole Life. I did not know, be∣fore I had the melancholy
Experience of it, how very irksome and painful a Feel it is, to be so very
far from those we truly regard. Adieu! my dear Friends, may Heaven shower
upon you all its choicest Blessings, is the sin∣cere and constant
Prayer of your ever faithful and affectionate</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIX. Miss N— to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 3, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE only Task you enjoined me on lea∣ving <HI>England,</HI> is,
perhaps, the most dif∣ficult you could have exacted from me; never∣theless,
I am resolved to attempt it; for, how∣ever you may be disappointed in my
Perfor∣mance, I shall, at least, have the Satisfaction 
<PB N="240" REF="247"/> of proving, that I chearfully obey any Com∣mand of
yours, and though surrounded with Difficulties, I enter upon the Performance
of my Promise with Courage; well knowing, from the Candour of your
Disposition, that you will accept of an earnest Desire on my Part to
gratify your laudable Curiosity, in Lieu of greater Abilities for such an
Undertaking.</P>
<P>I am not surprised, that a Person of your speculative Turn
should feel an earnest Desire to be made acquainted with some
Particulars relative to the wise and complicated Govern∣ment of the Republic
of <HI>Venice</HI>; it justly merits the Attention of the sensible and
curious Part of Mankind, were it only to discover by what Means it has been
preserved nearly in the same State, for such a Number of Ages; but it is
hardly possible to arrive with Certainty at this Knowledge; for there is no
Subject the <HI>Vene∣tians</HI> are so tenacious of conversing upon as
Politicks, profound Secrecy being the great Engine on which this very
singular Govern∣ment turns. I find <HI>one must</HI> not depend too much on
the Accounts of those who have written upon the Subject, for after allowing 
<PB N="241" REF="248"/> the utmost to their Integrity and Industry, they
must have been often liable to Misinfor∣mation, besides the unavoidable
Change that Time naturally produces in all sublunary Things. I have now lying
before me a Hi∣story of the Republic, by AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI, one by ST.
DISDIER, and another by the ABBÉE LANGIER, of a much later Date; and I
shall freely transcribe from these Authors, in as succinct a Manner as
possible, all such Passages as coincide with the present State of
Things: but the most pleasing As∣sistant I promise myself is, Mr.
SMITH, who has been settled in this City a great Number of Years, and was
formerly the <HI>British</HI> Con∣sul; he is now retired from Business,
and de∣votes his Time to the Study and Encourage∣ment of the polite Arts, of
which he is a li∣beral Protector; he is, at present, appointed
<HI>Chargé d'Affaires,</HI> by our Court, till the Ar∣rival of Sir JAMES
WRIGHT, who succeeds the present Ambassador at
<HI>Constantinople</HI> in the Residentship of <HI>Venice.</HI> I am
sorry the new Minister is not expected during my Stay here, for, as I am
told, he has spent some Time in this Capital, when upon his Travels in a
pri∣vate <PB N="242" REF="249"/> Character. Under his Auspices, I might,
perhaps, with more Ease, have pursued my Researches. Mr. SMITH is an
intelligent, sensi∣ble Man, and preserves, in a very advanced Age, a
Degree of Politeness, Vivacity and Good-Humour, rarely to be met with, which
renders his Conversation as pleasing as it is instructive. This Gentleman
is married to the Sister of Mr. MURRAY, the late Resident, a very amiable
Woman; their House is open every Evening to the <HI>English,</HI> in the
most easy, agreeable Manner, where I have infinite Plea∣sure in talking
over, in a polite chearful Cir∣cle, the <HI>Virtù</HI> that has engaged
my Attention in the Morning; but through this Correspon∣dence, I shall not
prophane my favourite Sub∣ject, by introducing it with the dry one, your
Curiosity has led me to.</P>
<P>As ST. DISDIER is my favourite Writer on the State of
<HI>Venice,</HI> I shall begin with his Account of the Origin of this City,
but must first endeavour to make you acquainted with the <HI>Lagunes,</HI>
(or Lakes) which I look upon to be the great Sources of Health and Plea∣sure,
to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as well as the Means <PB N="243" REF="250"/> by which
all their Wants are supplied; nothing can be more delicious, than the Airings
the Nobility take on these Lakes during the Sum∣mer Season, sometimes
attended with a Barge filled with Musicians, and often
<HI>tête-à-tête</HI> with their <HI>Cicisbeo,</HI> in a
Gondola, which is an easy and luxurious Conveyance. The <HI>Lagunes</HI> are
formed by a strong Bank of Sand, at the En∣trance of the Gulph, which extends
from South to West about thirty-six Miles, and is about six Hundred Feet
in Breadth; the Sea, ha∣ving broke through the Bank in six different Places,
has covered with Water all the low Land for seven or eight Miles, leaving a
Num∣ber of small Islands, upon which are built the Towns of the
<HI>Lagunes.</HI> The six Passages above∣mentioned, are the only Ports by
which Ves∣sels can approach to <HI>Venice.</HI> First, that of
<HI>Brondolo,</HI> to the South; secondly, <HI>Chiosa,</HI> (an episcopal
City;) thirdly, <HI>Malamocco</HI>; fourthly, <HI>Lido,</HI> (opposite to the
East Point of <HI>Venice;)</HI> fifthly, <HI>St. Erasmus,</HI> and
sixthly, the three Ports; by this last, only the small fishing Barks
can pass.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="251"/>In the Year 407, the <HI>Goths,</HI> under the
Com∣mand of RADAGAISUS, having broke like a Torrent into <HI>Italy,</HI> put
all the Inhabitants to the Sword, who attempted to oppose their Fury; the
People who were situated near the <HI>Lagunes</HI> (I have above described)
found no Asylum so secure as those maritime Isles, the most Part of
which were only inhabited by Fishermen: here the Fugitives remained in
Safety, until the Ge∣nerals, sent by the Emperor HONORIUS, (having defeated
the Barbarians) left the affrighted Wan∣derers at Liberty to return to the
<HI>Terra Firma.</HI> In the Year 413, the horrible Ravages com∣mitted by the
<HI>Visigoths,</HI> under ALARICK, made the same People a second Time
seek their for∣mer Retreat; and as these Invaders staid longer in
<HI>Italy</HI> than those led by RADAGAISUS, the Fugitives began to build
themselves comforta∣ble Habitations on these Islands. The
<HI>Paduans,</HI> to whom these Isles belonged, had a Port at that of
<HI>Rialto,</HI> (now called <HI>Venice)</HI> and the Senate having resolved
to make it a conside∣rable Place, not only by Way of Asylum for their
Subjects, but also to secure their Trade by Sea, sent, in the Year 441,
three Consuls, who proclaimed it a free Port, so that in a 
<PB N="245" REF="252"/> short Time it was peopled, not only by those who
retired to the Islands for Safety, but by many Persons of all Ranks, who
left the <HI>Terra Firma</HI> to settle there. The third Undertaking of the
Barbarians, under ATTILA, King of the <HI>Huns,</HI> threatened <HI>Italy</HI>
with total Desolation; that Scourge of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> as he was
justly denominated, having caused <HI>Germany, France,</HI> and
<HI>Italy,</HI> to be laid Waste, returned in the Year 453 a second Time
into the last-named Country, and destroyed <HI>Pavia, Milan, Padua,
Aquilea,</HI> and many other great Towns, the miserable Remains of whose
Inhabitants finish∣ed the Peopling not only of <HI>Rialto,</HI> but all the
other Isles of the <HI>Lagunes</HI>; and entertain∣ing no Hope of returning
to their ruined Ci∣ties, they caused to be transported from the <HI>Terra
Firma,</HI> Marble, and other Materials of their demolished Palaces; so
that, in the Space of about fifty Years, not only the People of Rank, but even
the Artizans, were conve∣niently lodged. <HI>Padua</HI> being at length
re-esta∣blished, and seeing <HI>Rialto</HI> become considerable, by the
Number of its Inhabitants, the Senate thought proper to send Consuls to
govern the People, with some Appearance of Authority; <PB N="246" REF="253"/>
but in Time the richest and most powerful of the Inhabitants of these
Isles got themselves declared Protectors of the People, with the Title of
Tribunes. In the Year 709, the Tri∣bunes of the twelve most considerable
Islands of the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> judging it necessary to have a better
Form of Government, resolved to com∣pose a Republic, and to elect a proper
Person from among themselves to be their Chief or Prince; but as they knew
they had no Right to take this Step against the Will of the
<HI>Pa∣duans,</HI> to whom they were indebted for the Place of their
Residence, they sent an Ambas∣sy to the Emperor LEO, who was Sovereign
of the whole Country, and to Pope JOHN the Fifth, to obtain their
Permission to elect a Prince, to whom they gave the Title of Doge. PAOLO
LUCE ANAFESTE, the first Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> was elected 288 Years after
<HI>Rialto</HI> was proclaimed a free Port by the <HI>Paduans.</HI> This
Election was made at <HI>Ereclea,</HI> a Town of the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> in the
Year 709; at this Place, the first three Doges resided. These Princes
ruled with absolute Power till 1172, when, upon the Election of SEBASTIAN
ZIANI, the Form of Government became democratical, and <PB N="247" REF="254"/>
continued so till 1289, when the Doge, PIETRO GRADENIGO, found Means to
change it to an Aristocracy; this he effected by getting a De∣cree passed
in the <HI>Quarantia Criminale,</HI> that all those who had composed the
great Council for four Years, should be ballotted for in that Chamber of
Justice, and such of them who had twelve Balls in their Favour, and who
attended the Council on a certain Day, at an appointed Hour, should have
their Names written in a Book, called <HI>Il Libro d'Oro,</HI> and that they
and their Descendants should form the great Council forever. As this
Intrigue was managed with much Secrecy, none had Notice to attend, but those
whom the Doge and his Party approved of, or who had Friends in the
<HI>Quarantia.</HI> When this chosen Number were assembled, at the
Ringing of a Bell, the Doors were locked, and no more suffered to enter. This
the <HI>Venetians</HI> call 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Il Serrar del Cansiglio,</HI>"</Q> and is one
of the most remark∣able Epochas of their Government: though this Step
wrested all Share of the Administra∣tion out of the Hands of the Citizens,
and unjustly deprived some Families of their Ti∣tle to Nobility, yet it was
owing to this Event, <PB N="248" REF="255"/> that the Republic established a
more perfect Form of Government than she before enjoyed, and which continues,
with very little Change, to this Day. BAYAMONTE TIEPOLI, the Head of one of the
most antient Families of the Republic, joined the <HI>Quirini,</HI> and
some other illustrious Persons, in a Conspiracy to sacrifice the Doge
to their Resentment, for this Innova∣tion; but all the Conspirators
perished in the Enterprise, and this Attempt only occasioned fresh
Regulations, which more securely establish∣ed the new Form of
Government.</P>
<P>Accept of thus much, by Way of Intro∣duction to a Sketch of the
present State of the Republic of <HI>Venice,</HI> and in my next, I shall
have the Honour to introduce you to SUA SERENITA, the Doge, but at present
the Post will only allow me Time to assure you how sincerely I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LX. Miss N— to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>April</HI> 9,
1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Promised in my last to introduce you to the Doge of
<HI>Venice,</HI> and I think you will agree with me, that his Serenity is a
very uncomfortable Being. Since the Period of <HI>Il Serrar del
Consiglio,</HI> his Power has gra∣dually decreased. A Procurator of St.
<HI>Mark</HI> is generally elected Prince, who has ser∣ved the Republic in
expensive Embassies, or in the first Offices of the State. Although he
has the Name of Sovereign, the Power remains with the Senate; and having little
Influence in the Affairs of the State, great Wisdom is by no Means an
essential Recom∣mendation to this high Rank; an advanced Age, an easy
Disposition, and illustrious Birth, are the Qualifications chiefly
sought for in the Doge; his Children, Grand-Children, and Bro∣thers are
disqualified from holding any consi∣derable <PB N="250" REF="257"/>
Employment connected with Govern∣ment during his Reign. His Wife was for∣merly
treated <HI>en Princesse,</HI> and crowned with great Magnificence, but
that custom is now exploded; however, she still retains the Title of
<HI>Dogeressa.</HI> Though the Doge presides at all the Councils, he is
only acknowledged Head of the Senate, at the Tribunals, and in the Palace of
St. <HI>Mark.</HI> He cannot leave the City without the previous Leave of his
Coun∣sellors; he is allowed no Marks of Distinction in his Dress or
Equipage when he makes pri∣vate Visits, or leaves the City, except that his
Family are suffered to use Gold or Silver Lace on their Liveries, and in
the Ornaments of their Box at the Theatre; and the Ladies wear rich coloured
Cloaths at public Festivals, when the <HI>Pragmatica</HI> obliges the other
noble <HI>Venetians</HI> to appear in black. Upon public Occasions, his
Serenity generally wears a Vest and Ducal Mantle of Brocade of Gold or
Silver, lined with Ermine, a Cap of Crimson Velvet, with a Border of Gold, to
represent the Diadem, and under it a short Hood of Gauze, and Shoes of
Crimson Damask. The Sword of State is carried after the Prince, and 
<PB N="251" REF="258"/> at the Head of the Seignory, to shew where the real
Power is lodged. A folding Chair, with a gilt Frame, and a Seat of Brocade,
with a Stool of the same to set his Foot on, and a large Parisole of Gold
Stuff, are car∣ried with the Doge in all public Processions, and they
pretend that this Regalia was pre∣sented to the famous SEBASTIAN ZIANI by
Pope ALEXANDER the Third, in acknowledg∣ment of the Protection he received from
the Republic, when oppressed by the Emperor FREDERICK the Second. The Doge
has the Title of Serenity and Serene Prince, but to shew that they are not
attached to his Person alone, Ambassadors use them in his Absence in
addressing the College. Though all Dis∣patches are written in the Name of
the Prince, and the Answers addressed to him, yet he can∣not open them
without the Members of the Col∣lege being present, whereas they can open, and
even answer them, without his being present; and to shew that his Power
and Influence is merely imaginary, the Senate neither propose any
Ques∣tion, or take any Resolution, till he and his Counsellors are
withdrawn; they then examine the Affairs under Debate, take the Advice of 
<PB N="252" REF="259"/> the Savi, and prepare their Deliberations in Writing, to
be carried to the first Meeting of the Senate, where the Doge and his
Coun∣sellors are present, who have a Voice to ap∣prove or disapprove in
common with the other Senators. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Money bears the Name of
the Doge, and was formerly stamped as his Coin, when the Power of the Prince
was absolute; at present is substituted the Figure of a Man in the
Ducal Habit on his Knees before St. <HI>Mark,</HI> to shew that the Doge is
subject to the Republic, of which St. <HI>Mark</HI> is the Hieroglyphic. The
Income of the Prince is fourteen thousand Ducats <HI>per Annum,</HI> (which
amounts to about two thousand Pounds ster∣ling) to maintain his Family, and
to defray the Expence of treating the Seignory four Times a Year. The foreign
Ambassadors, who have made their public Entry, have a Right to be at
these Feasts. The Republic pay all the Officers who attend the Prince on
public Occasions: he has the Power of selling the dif∣ferent Employments of
the Palace, in which, and collating the Benefices of St. <HI>Mark,</HI>
con∣sist the principal Emoluments of his Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="260"/>When the Doge dies, his Body is embalmed, and
exposed for three Days on a Bed of State, in an Apartment of the Palace
destined for that Purpose. This Exposition is not only to give the People
an Opportunity to pay the last Honours to their Prince, but also to give
the Senate Time to receive any Complaints against his Administration, and
to give his Creditors Leisure to make their Demands on his Heirs, which if
they refuse to satisfy, he is deprived of funeral Honours at the Ex∣pence
of the Republic: for this Reason, on the Death of a Doge, three Inquisitors
are appointed to search into his past Conduct, to hear all Complaints, and
to satisfy all Demands at the Expence of the Succession. The No∣bles who
assist at the Funeral, are dressed in Scarlet Robes, to shew that
it is not the Go∣vernment of the Prince that causes the Hap∣piness of the
State, and that the Republic being free, ought not to shew any Marks of
Affliction at his Death. The Obsequies are no sooner over, than all the
Nobles, who are more than thirty Years of Age, assemble in the great
Council-Chamber, and elect five Cor∣rectors, <PB N="254" REF="261"/> who
inspect the Book of Statutes that the Doge, on his Election, swears to
observe. These five Noblemen have a Right to add to, or to retrench from
these Statutes, what∣ever they think necessary for the Good of the State.
The Ballotation upon this Occasion is managed with so much Caution, that it
is im∣possible for any Thing but Chance to decide which shall be the
forty-one Senators chose out of the whole Number to elect a Successor to
the deceased Prince. When these Electors have been approved by the general
Council, they are shut up in the Palace of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and not
suffered to stir out until the Election is over; twenty-five of the
forty-one Voices must be in Favour of the Person that is chosen. The
first Thing required of the Doge is, to swear to the Observance of the
Book of Sta∣tutes. He then shews himself to the People, and in going out of
the Palace for that Pur∣pose, passes through the Chamber in which his
Body is to be exposed after his Death, and <HI>there</HI> he receives from
the Grand Chancellor the first Compliments on his new Dignity. He then gets
into a Machine, not unlike a great Tub, and two hundred Men, who belong to 
<PB N="255" REF="262"/> the Arsenal, carry him by Turns round the Place of St.
<HI>Mark</HI> on their Shoulders. The Doge thus seated, one of his Children,
or some near Relation, stands behind him, holding two Basons filled with
Money, which he distributes among the Populace.</P>
<P>Having killed one Prince, and proclaimed another, I think I may
decently take my Leave for the present; and should you be as tired with
reading, as I am with writing, you will wish you had never heard of his
Serenity. I hope you will think my next more interesting, which will treat of
the different Councils of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 12, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING in my last dispatched his Sere∣nity the Doge, I now
proceed with Ala∣crity to give you an Account of the Coun∣cils, of which,
according to AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAIE, there are three principal; the great one,
which comprehends all the Nobility; the College, which gives Audience to
Am∣bassadors; and the Pregadi, which is the Se∣nate. The Great-Council
meets every <HI>Sunday</HI> and Holiday to chuse Magistrates, which is done
by Ballotation. The Nobles have no Right to enter into it, until they are
twenty-five Years old, but the Seignory dispense some∣times with their
being under Age. This As∣sembly has a Right of confirming or annulling the
Decrees of the Senate, and to make or repeal Laws. The most remarkable
standing Laws are these, <HI>viz.</HI> that all Ecclesiastics are 
<PB N="257" REF="264"/> excluded from every civil Employment and public
Assembly. The Nobles cannot arrive at the principal Offices, but by
Gradation; nor can they hold more than one Office at once, be it ever so
small. Those who refuse any Employment, are fined two thousand Du∣cats,
and banished for two Years from the Great Council and Broglio; (this Name
they give to an Apartment under the <HI>Procuratia Nuova,</HI> where the
Noblemen meet in a Mor∣ning, and those who are trying to attain any Place in
the Government, use this Opportu∣nity to solicit the Votes of their Friends
for their Ballotation in the Great Council.) No Magistrate can resign, or
leave the City. All the Sons of the Nobility have equal Portions: if a Daughter
has more than five thousand Ducats, (about six hundred Pounds sterling)
she receives the Income of the Overplus for her own separate Use, and if
she dies without Chil∣dren, it returns to her Family. All Subjects of the
Republic (the Doge not excepted) pay Taxes in Proportion to their Fortune. The
Magistrates in civil Causes can receive no Vi∣sits or Recommendation of
the Parties, but may in criminal ones, if they are not State 
<PB N="258" REF="265"/> Affairs. No Nobleman can enter into Trade. The Great
Council corrects all public Errors, and redresses all Grievances imposed
by those who use their Authority unlawfully, so that this may be called
the first Tribunal, and the Basis, as well as Support of the Republic.</P>
<P>To gratify the young Nobility, they admit thirty by Lot every Year
into the Great Coun∣cil, who are only twenty Years of Age, and allow them the
same Privileges as those who are twenty-five; these young ones are called
<HI>Barbarini,</HI> because they are chosen on the Day of St. BARBARA. This
Assembly sits from eight in the Morning until Noon; it is held in the
largest Room of the Palace: at the upper End are raised Seats, on which the
Doge and his Counsellors are placed. The Chief of the Council of Ten, the
Avoga∣dores and the Censors are seated round the Hall, upon raised
Benches. The Counsellors of the Doge can convoke, at Pleasure, the Great
Council, and for this Purpose they cause the Bells of the principal
Churches in the six Quar∣ters of the Town to be rung, and at this Sig∣nal,
the Nobles attend the Council without <PB N="259" REF="266"/> Arms, which they
are forbid to carry there on Pain of Death.</P>
<P>When AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAIE wrote his History of the Republic of
<HI>Venice,</HI> the No∣bles were computed at five and twenty Hun∣dred; but
they now fall very short of that Calculation. The Great Council usually
con∣sists of about eight hundred, and nearly the same Number is
supposed to be employed in the Provinces, on Embassies, and other
public Services; or, for private Reasons, are not in a Situation to attend in
Council.</P>
<P>THE COLLEGE.</P>
<P>THE College is formed of twenty-six Mem∣bers, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Doge and his six Counsellors, three of the <HI>Quarantia Criminale,</HI>
(who are changed every two Months) six <HI>Savi Grandi,</HI> five of the
<HI>Savi</HI> of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> and the five <HI>Savi</HI> of Order.
The College has the Right of assembling the Senate, and propo∣sing what
is to be debated therein; but yet they must obey its Resolutions, and act
in <PB N="260" REF="267"/> Concert with it. At this Tribunal the Maje∣sty of
the Prince may be said to reside, for here the Ambassadors have their
Audience, all Letters upon foreign Affairs are read, all Me∣morials are
presented, and all Privileges, in Regard to Benefices, Prelates, <HI>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</HI> are pleaded. In short, this is the Committee of Ways and Means,
where all Business is first planned, in order to be laid before the
Senate for their Concurrence.</P>
<P>THE SENATE.</P>
<P>THE Senate had formerly the Name of <HI>Pregadi</HI> given to it,
because it then never as∣sembled but upon extraordinary Occasions; and
the Magistrates were obliged to request the Attendance of the principal
Citizens, when any important Affair required their Advice. This Assembly
now meets every <HI>Wednesday</HI> and <HI>Fri∣day,</HI> and, upon an
Emergency, the <HI>Savi</HI> for the Week can call an extraordinary
<HI>Pregadi.</HI> This Tribunal possesses all the Authority of the
Republic, for here all Resolutions con∣cerning Peace and War are taken, all
Leagues <PB N="261" REF="268"/> and Alliances are made, Ambassadors and
also Officers who have considerable Rank in the Army are nominated, and all
Taxes are imposed according to the Exigency of Affairs. The Consultations
of the College are here examin∣ed and determined by a Plurality of Voices. This
Institution in its Commencement was only composed of sixty Senators,
called an <HI>ordinary Pregadi</HI>; but being often obliged, in Cases of
Importance, to add to the Number, sixty more were created, called the
<HI>Junto:</HI> these hundred and twenty Senators are always No∣blemen of
advanced Age and approved Merit. The Members of the College, the Council of
Ten, the <HI>Quarantia Criminale,</HI> the Procurators of St. <HI>Mark,</HI>
with most Part of the Magi∣strates, enter also into the <HI>Pregadi,</HI>
so that it now consists of near three hundred Members, one Part whereof
have a Right to vote, the rest can only hearken and learn the Rules of
Government. The Doge and his Counsellors are the only Persons whose
Advice can be bal∣lotted, to prevent the Confusion that would probably
arise from a Diversity of Opinions, as half the Votes must be in Favour
of the Ques∣tion before it can pass. Those who have no 
<PB N="262" REF="269"/> Right to vote, may harangue and contradict the Opinions
proposed. The hundred and twenty, who compose the ordinary <HI>Pregadi</HI>
and <HI>Junto,</HI> are ballotted every Year in the Great Council, to be
changed or continued, as shall be de∣termined in the said Council. The
Senate is particularly attentive in maintaining Harmony among the Nobles; well
knowing, that a con∣trary Behaviour might be productive of fatal Consequences
to the Liberty of the Country, as was formerly the Case with
<HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Verona.</HI></P>
<P>The COUNSELLORS of the DOGE.</P>
<P>THE Counsellors of the Doge (or more pro∣perly of the Signory) are
six in Number, they are chosen from amongst the oldest Senators of the
first Rank; though they are Counsel∣lors for a Year, they only assist
in the Col∣lege eight Months; the other four Months they preside in the
<HI>Quarantia Criminale,</HI> in the same Manner as the Chiefs of that
Chamber have places in the College during two Months. These six
Counsellors have more Power than the Doge; <PB N="263" REF="270"/> their
Employment is two-fold: first, they are obliged to consult with the Doge
upon all Matters that are to be proposed in the Coun∣cils, to open all
Letters directed to the Sig∣nory, to receive Petitions, and to appoint Judges
to settle any Dispute which may arise about Jurisdiction; and
secondly, to preside at all Councils, and, during an <HI>Interregnum,</HI>
to dis∣patch Orders to all the Officers of the State. When the Doge is ill,
the most antient of the Counsellors represent him in the College, and at
all public Functions: but he is nei∣ther allowed to sit in the ducal Chair,
or wear the Habit of the Prince, and is only distinguished by a Cap which
he never takes off, no more than the Doge does his ducal Crown. The
Counsellors, whilst in Office, wear scarlet Gowns.</P>
<P>As I shall, in my next, introduce you to a Tribunal so awful,
that the bare Name makes thousands tremble, I shall allow myself some
Respite for the present, and endeavour to lose the Idea of these dry
intricate Subjects in the more pleasing ones of <HI>Virtù.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="271"/>You will excuse my breaking off thus, when I
tell you, that my Gondola now waits to carry me to a <HI>dilletanti</HI> Party,
with whom I am going to examine the famous Marriage of PAOLO VERONESE, at the
Convent of St. <HI>George.</HI> It so rarely happens, that our Plea∣sures
in the Enjoyment equal the Vivacity of our Expectation, I almost fear I
promise myself too much on this Occasion; but if this celebrated Piece
deserves half the Encomiums that are bestowed upon it, my Delight will be
exqui∣site: I heartily wish you could be a Partaker of it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII. Miss N— to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>April</HI> 15,
1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Promised, in my last, to introduce you to the most
tremendous Tribunal, that, per∣haps, ever poor Culprits trembled before, if we
view it in its original State: but I think all the sensible People, I have
conversed with in <HI>Venice,</HI> agree, that it is somewhat relaxed, from
its primitive Severity, though still to be dreaded for the Extent of Power,
the Inqui∣sitors of State are entrusted with.</P>
<P>The INQUISITION.</P>
<P>THIS Tribunal is composed of two of the Council of Ten, and one of
the Counsellors of the Doge. As the Affairs, that fall under the Cognizance
thereof are of the utmost Conse∣quence to the State, depending chiefly upon
cer∣tain Intelligences collected by Spies, so all their Proceedings are
managed with the deepest Se∣crecy; and, in some Cases, they are obliged 
<PB N="266" REF="273"/> to use Severity, and to punish Offenders in a very
exemplary Manner, The Life of the Doge, the Nobles, and all the Subjects of the
State, lie at the Mercy of this Tribunal, pro∣vided the three Inquisitors
entirely concur in Opinion; and in this Case, they are not obliged to give an
Account of their Actions to any one, or even communicate them to the Coun∣cil
of Ten. The Execution of the Sentences pronounced by these Judges is not
less se∣cret than their Judgments, except when the Crime is of a public
Nature: in private Cases, to prevent Exclamations against such seeming
Severity, as often punishes with Death an un∣guarded Expression against
so rigorous a Go∣vernment, (it is said) they send in the Night, and have
the Offender seized, and pronounce his Doom, without any other Ceremony, than
confronting him with two Witnesses, if there are any, or else, on the
bare Report of Spies. As many Inconveniencies have arisen from this
despotic Method of Proceeding, a Law has been provided, that the
Inquisitors shall not put to Death a noble Venetian, without first
hearing his Defence. If a Stranger of any Consequence becomes suspected
by this Tri∣bunal, <PB N="267" REF="274"/> he must expect to lose his
Papers, and receive an Order, signed by one of the Inqui∣sitors, requiring
him to leave the State within a limited Time, on Pain of Death. As the
<HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility, of every Class, are forbid to hold any Sort of
Correspondence with Am∣bassadors, or foreign Ministers, or even with
the meanest Person in their Families, it is for this Intent, that the Spies
of the Inquisitors are particularly vigilant in collecting Matter of
Complaint.</P>
<P>Harsh as the Proceedings of this Tribunal must appear to
<HI>Englishmen,</HI> who are blessed with the happiest Form of
Government, the sensible and unprejudiced MONTESQUIEU as∣serts, that it
has often saved the Republic of <HI>Venice</HI> from total Destruction.</P>
<P>The COUNCIL OF TEN.</P>
<P>THIS was orignally, a mere temporary Cham∣ber of Justice,
appointed to enquire into the famous Conspiracy of TIEPOLI: but was soon
after made perpetual, and is now one of the <PB N="268" REF="275"/> most
respectable Tribunals of the Republic; it takes Cognizance of all the
criminal Affairs among the Nobility, that happen in the City, or State of
<HI>Venice,</HI> and judges Crimes of <HI>Leze Majesté,</HI> and all
other attrocious Offences. This Council has the Care of the public
Tranqui∣lity, and their Power is as much to be dreaded by the Nobles, as by the
common People. The Doge and his Counsellors have a Right to enter this
Chamber of Justice; but the ten Senators, of whom it is composed, have not
less Power in the Absence of the Doge, than when he is present: they are
chosen out of diffe∣rent Families, and are elected in the Great Coun∣cil
every Year; they then elect three among themselves to be the Head of the
Councils; these rule Week about, and are changed every three Months. The
Chief in Office receives all Informations from Spies, and reports them to his
Colleagues, who, upon the Deposition of Witnesses, and the Answers of
the accused, proceed against them before the Council, where the Offender is
not allowed to plead for him∣self personally, or by Lawyer. The armed
Galley that always lies at St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Place, and some Cannon and
Gallies at the Arsenal, <PB N="269" REF="276"/> are under the Command of the
Council of Ten. They meet only once a Week, unless some Affair of
Importance calls them oftener together.</P>
<P>The <HI>QUARANTIA CRIMINALE.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are three Courts of Justice, that con∣sist each of forty
Judges; the first of these is the most antient Tribunal of the Republic,
but it has suffered a great Diminution of Power by the Establishment of
the Council of Ten. The forty Judges of the upper Chamber have a Right to vote
in the Senate; and the three Chiefs, who are Presidents, have likewise
Seats in the College, during the two last Months they are in Office; and
three of the Counsellors of the Doge preside in the <HI>Quarantia
Criminale,</HI> the four last Months of their Year, to shew the Connexion
there is between this Chamber and the College. This Office is generally filled
by Noblemen who are not rich; they receive thirty Ducats <HI>per</HI> Month by
it, and acquire Consi∣deration among the Nobility. To arrive at this Chamber,
they must pass through the <PB N="270" REF="277"/> other <HI>Quarantias</HI>
first, which are much infe∣rior in Authority. Besides these, there are
many other lower Courts of Justice that take Cognizance of mercantile
Affairs, Bankrupt∣cies, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> It is worthy of Observation,
in this wise and intricate Government, how all the superior Tribunals are
interwoven with, and, if I may use the Expression, germinate from, each
other.</P>
<P><HI>SAVI GRANDI.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Magistrates are six in Number; they are chosen from
among the wisest of the Senators, and, during the Time they are in office,
manage all political Affairs of Impor∣tance, and are, properly speaking,
prime Mi∣nisters: they are elected by the Senate, and changed every six
Months, three at a Time, by which Means, there remain three old Se∣nators in
Office, who are able to inform the new elected ones, of what happened during
their Administration, and serves as a model for the future Conduct of the
new Ministers.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="278"/><HI>SAVI</HI> of the <HI>TERRA FIRMA.</HI></P>
<P>THESE five Officers of the State have little less Authority in the
College than the <HI>Savi Grandi</HI>; they are the same Length of Time in
Office, are chosen of a less advanced Age, and are preferred according to
their Applica∣tion, and the Abilities they have shewn in the Offices they
must necessarily have passed through to arrive at this. The first,
or <HI>Savi Cashier,</HI> is Pay-Master; the second, <HI>Savi degli
Scritura,</HI> Se∣cretary at War, and the third, <HI>Savi</HI> of the
Or∣dinance, has the Direction of the Military of the <HI>Terra Firma</HI>; the
other two are only to assist the three first. They are elected by the
Senate, as the <HI>Savi Grandi,</HI> and have a Right to vote on every Motion,
which may be pro∣posed by them; but, to preserve a Subordina∣tion between
the two Offices, have no Right to vote in the Senate.</P>
<P><HI>SAVI</HI> of ORDER.</P>
<P>THIS Magistracy is the same in Number as the <HI>Savi</HI> of
the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> but is with∣out <PB N="272" REF="279"/>
Jurisdiction, and is only a School, as it were, wherein the young Nobility
may learn the Art of Government. These Noblemen, during the six Months they
are in Office, assist at all the Consultations of the College, and
conse∣quently have a Share in the Secrets of State; they have no Right to
vote either in the Col∣lege or Senate, but may give their Opinion at the
Consultations of the <HI>Savi,</HI> always speak∣ing uncovered and
standing. They are allowed to see all the Dispatches that are sent to
Am∣bassadors, and the Registers of the Affairs of State. This Employment
is looked upon by the Republic, as the Touchstone of the Cha∣racter and
Genius of their young Nobility.</P>
<P>PROCURATORS of ST. <HI>MARK.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Honour is generally bestowed on such of the Nobility who
have been of essential Ser∣vice to their Country in expensive
Embassies, in a naval Command, or for having gone through the most
important Employments of the State with Honour and Integrity. The Procurators
take Place of all the other Nobi∣lity; <PB N="273" REF="280"/> they have the
Disposal of all pious Le∣gacies, are the Guardians of Orphans, and
Protectors of Widows. The Number was for∣merly confined to nine, but is now
encreased to eleven. In pressing Necessities of the Re∣public, this
Dignity has been sold for immense Sums; but, except in Cases of public
Distress, it can only be disposed of by Merit; and those who
purchase it never have any Succes∣sors appointed when they die. Their
Dress is a purple Robe. The magnificent Buildings on each Side of St.
<HI>Mark</HI>'s Place, were ori∣ginally destined for the Habitation of the
Pro∣curators, and from thence called <HI>Procuratias</HI>; but they are now
chiefly rented to Strangers and foreign Ministers, by Way of
<HI>Casinos.</HI></P>
<P>The GRAND CHANCELLOR.</P>
<P>THIS Dignity can only be enjoyed by a Person of the Rank of
Citizen; he takes Place of all the other Magistrates, and wears a pur∣ple
Robe, like the Procurators of St. <HI>Mark.</HI> All the Councils are open to
him; he holds the Seal of the Republic, and assists at read∣ing 
<PB N="274" REF="281"/> and answering the Dispatches from Am∣bassadors,
and every Thing else material that is treated of in the Senate. He has the
Ti∣tle of <HI>Excellenza,</HI> and is the Head of the Peo∣ple, as the Doge is
of the Nobility. His In∣come is about nine thousand Ducats <HI>per
An∣num.</HI> He is buried with great Pomp, at the Expence of the Republic.</P>
<P>The <HI>AVOGADORES.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Office resembles, in Part, that of Attorney-General in
<HI>England,</HI> but is divided among three People; the greatest Instance
of its Power is, being able, for the Space of three Days, to suspend the
Judgment of all the other Courts of Justice, when the Crime is not clearly
proved upon the Culprit. In this Particular, the <HI>Avogador</HI> resembles
the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Tribunes of the People. They are elected by the Senate, but
the Choice must be con∣firmed by the Grand Council, where all Pro∣ceedings
would be null, if one of the <HI>Avo∣gadores</HI> did not assist. Their
Dress, when in Office, is a purple Robe.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282"/>The TWO CENSORS.</P>
<P>THE Jurisdiction of the Censors extends principally to the
Manners of particular Per∣sons; to the Intrigues of the Nobles in the
<HI>Broglio</HI>; to the Condemnation and Fining of those who violate the
Statutes of the Great Council; to the Payment of Wages, Pilfering of Servants,
and Correction of <HI>Gondaliers.</HI> They are sixteen Months in Office;
during which Term, they have a Right to vote in the <HI>Pre∣gadi,</HI> and wear
purple Gowns.</P>
<P>I have extended this beyond the common Bounds of a Letter, and find
that by so doing, I have lost Half an Hour of an agreeable Conversation,
where I am engaged this Even∣ing, so shall only add, that I am
sincerely</P>

<P>P. S. I am obliged to one of my <HI>Gonda∣liers,</HI> a clever,
intelligent Fellow, for remind∣ing me, that it is past the Hour of my
En∣gagement; <PB N="276" REF="283"/> and here let me do Justice to this

<HEAD>LETTER LXIII. Miss N—, to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 19, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WITH your Leave, my good Friend, I am going to engage you in a
little Trip to the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> in Order to intro∣duce you to the
<HI>Podestàs</HI> and <HI>Capitanios,</HI> a Set of Gentlemen of no
small Consequence, I as∣sure you, in their respective
Governments.</P>
<P>To the greater Towns of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> the Senate send
two Noblemen, with the Ti∣tles of <HI>Podestà</HI> and
<HI>Capitanio</HI>; these equally re∣present the Republic, the first in
the Admi∣nistration <PB N="277" REF="284"/> of civil Justice, the second
in the Command of Military Affairs. The <HI>Podestà</HI> is the
principal Person, as he takes Cognizance of all that regards the Police, and
the good Order of the People. The <HI>Capitanio,</HI> besides the Command of
the Troops, has Power to punish the Inhabitants for any Crime com∣mitted in
the Streets, during the Course of the Night. He has also the Care of the
public Money, which is collected by Receivers, who are accountable to him for
it. The <HI>Podestàs</HI> and <HI>Capitanios</HI> are obliged to
report to the Senate every Measure they take. To the Ca∣pitals of Provinces
are generally sent both the above-mentioned Officers; but in Towns of small
Importance, the two Offices are united in the Person of the
<HI>Podestà,</HI> who holds his Employment sixteen Months. The
Appoint∣ments allowed them by the Republic are very small, in Comparison to
what they are obli∣ged to spend in the Capitals, therefore to them the Senate
generally sends rich Noblemen, and poor ones to the small Towns, where, not
being obliged to make an expensive Appear∣ance, they may, if they please,
gain a com∣fortable <PB N="278" REF="285"/> Subsistence by their Post,
during the Time they are employed in it.</P>
<P>A Nobleman of the first Rank is always sent into the
<HI>Frioul,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Provedi∣tore-General</HI> of <HI>Palma
Nova</HI>; this Place is of great Consequence to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as
it serves for a Frontier to the Emperor's Dominions, and is a strong
Barrier against the Incursions of the <HI>Turks.</HI> At <HI>Udeney,</HI>
where the Patriarch of <HI>Aqui∣lia</HI> resides, the Republic employs only a
Lieu∣tenant and some Subalterns. In <HI>Istria</HI> are four episcopal
Towns, with five others not so con∣siderable, each of them governed by a
<HI>Podestà.</HI> The Commanding-Officers of these Places, as well
as those of the <HI>Levant</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> are changed only once
in two Years. The Senate gives the Title of Counts, Governors, and Captains, to
the Noblemen who are sent into <HI>Dalmatia</HI> to administer Justice.
The Ma∣gistrates of the principal Towns, (for Exam∣ple, the Counts of
<HI>Spalatro</HI> and <HI>Gara,</HI> who are likewise Archbishops) have
appointed to them a Council of three noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> with∣out whom
they cannot determine on any Thing; but all these Officers are subject to
the <HI>Prove∣ditore-General,</HI> <PB N="279" REF="286"/> who has full
Authority in all Affairs civil and military. The Isles of <HI>Cor∣fuzant</HI>
and <HI>Cephalonia,</HI> are each governed by a <HI>Proveditore,</HI>
assisted by a Council of three noble <HI>Venetians. Corfu</HI> is a Place
of great Importance, as it commands the Entrance of the Gulph, and is the
Repository of the <HI>Ve∣netian</HI> Merchandize brought from the
<HI>Levant</HI>; this Place is regarded by the <HI>Turks</HI> with a jealous
Eye. There is also a General of these three Isles, to whom the particular
<HI>Proveditores</HI> render Obedience, as the Magistrates of the Towns in
<HI>Dalmatia</HI> do to the <HI>Proveditore-Ge∣neral.</HI></P>
<P>INQUISITORS of the <HI>TERRA FIRMA.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY five Years, Inquisitors are sent to hold Courts in the
several Provinces of the <HI>Terra Firma</HI>; their Business is to
inspect into the Conduct of <HI>Podestàs</HI> and
<HI>Capitanios,</HI> and to receive all Complaints of Mal-administra∣tion of
Justice. Their Censures are seldom severe, but when there are Proofs of
Embez∣zlement of the public Money, and in that <PB N="280" REF="287"/> Case,
their Office obliges them to act with the utmost Rigour. They are attended by
a Com∣pany of Cavalry, and an Executioner, that they may punish on the Spot
all Offences that are clearly proved. This gives the Provin∣cials a very high
Idea of the Justice of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government.</P>
<P>The MAGISTRATES of POMP.</P>
<P><HI>Gli Sopre Proveditore alle Pompe,</HI> are Sena∣tors, who by
strict Ordinances suppress all out∣ward Marks of Luxury, and preserve
an exact Equality, in the exterior Appearance of the Nobility. At public
Feasts, the Dress of the Ladies is always black, except on some
Oc∣casions, when they are allowed to wear a rich gold or silver Stuff
Petticoat with their black Gowns. The noble <HI>Venetians</HI> are not
suffered to use gold or silver Lace on their Boatmen's Liveries, or in
their Boxes at the Theatres, except the Doge's Family and the Grand
Chan∣cellor's. In Masking-Time, the Ladies may wear rich coloured Cloaths,
which is about six Months in the Year; and when they are 
<PB N="281" REF="288"/> at their Estates on the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> they may
give as rich Liveries as they choose, but the Servants who wear them never
attend them at <HI>Venice,</HI> but in their own Houses.</P>
<P>REVENUES and EXPENCES of the STATE.</P>
<P>THE settled Revenue of the Republic is supposed, at present,
according to the best Cal∣culation, to amount to about a Million and a Half
sterling <HI>per Annum</HI>; this is raised by Imports and Exports, and
Taxes upon all the Provisions consumed in the City of <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> and
upon all Sorts of Merchandizes, and by other Duties raised in the Isles of
the <HI>La∣gunes,</HI> and upon all the Estates situated near
<HI>Venice,</HI> called the <HI>Dogado</HI> or Dutchy. Another Part of the
Revenue is raised in the same Manner from the Towns and Provinces of the
<HI>Terra Firma,</HI> and also from <HI>Istria, Dalma∣tia,</HI> and the
Isles of <HI>Corfu, Zant,</HI> and <HI>Cepha∣lonia.</HI> A large Portion
likewise arises from the Salt made at <HI>Corfu</HI> and <HI>Chiosa</HI>;
and to this may be added, twenty thousand Ducats <HI>per</HI> 
<PB N="282" REF="289"/> Month, that are paid into the Coffers of the Republic
from a Lottery, on the same Plan as those of <HI>Rome</HI> and
<HI>Naples,</HI> which has been established within these thirty Years. In
Time of War, the Senate finds great Resources by ennobling rich Families,
making supernumerary Procurators of St. <HI>Mark</HI>; by renewing old Taxes,
and imposing new ones. The yearly Expences of Government do not require above
half the Income of the State, so that in Time of Peace the Republic can lay
up vast Sums; by which Means, the <HI>Venetians</HI> are enabled to negotiate
all their Affairs with foreign Powers by the Force of Money instead of
Arms.</P>
<P>The FORCES of the REPUBLIC.</P>
<P>IN Time of Peace, the <HI>Venetians</HI> are sup∣posed to pay
about twenty-five thousand Men; but there is strong Reason to believe,
that not above one third of them are effective, owing to the Abuses of the
<HI>Proveditores</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia.</HI> The Infantry are chiefly
<HI>Sclavonians, Morlaques,</HI> and <HI>Albanians</HI>; they are esteemed
brave Soldiers, and are firmly attached to the <PB N="283" REF="290"/>
<HI>Venetians,</HI> from an inveterate Hatred to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who are
their natural Enemies. The Cavalry are partly composed of the same
Na∣tions, and partly of <HI>Ultramontanes.</HI> The Ge∣neral in Chief must
always be a Foreigner, and his Power is so over-ruled by the
<HI>Pro∣veditore-General,</HI> that he has only the Name of Commander of the
Forces. The chief At∣tention of the Senate is paid to the Marine. They have no
regular naval Force in Time of Peace; but upon an Emergency, can arm thirty
Galleys, able to act against their Ene∣mies, in a very expeditious Manner.
They always keep some Galleys in the <HI>Levant,</HI> with other Vessels,
to guard the Provinces situated near the Sea; these are under the Command
of the <HI>Proveditore-General.</HI> A Squadron of six Gal∣leys, and
several other Vessels, are likewise em∣ployed to cruize about the Mouth
of the Gulph, to secure the Traders from the Corsairs, and to make the
Merchants pay their proper Du∣ties. The Nobleman who commands this Squa∣dron
has the Title of General of the Gulph, his Command continues for three Years.
The Republic, in Peace as well as in War, creates a <HI>Proveditore
General,</HI> who commands both the <PB N="284" REF="291"/> Fleet and Army; he
has an absolute Power to punish with Death all Officers, Soldiers, and
Sailors, and to dispose of all Posts in the Army and Navy; he resides
at <HI>Corfu</HI> the first three Years he is in Office, and when that Time
is expired, he is obliged to render an Account of his Administration to the
Senate.</P>
<P>SPIES and INFORMERS.</P>
<P>SPIES have ever been looked upon as in∣famous Ministers of
Tyranny; but the Senate of <HI>Venice</HI> have found Means to conceal the
Shame of such Miscreants, by making Mouths of Stone speak for them; for
in many Parts of the Palace of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and in all the Parts of the
City near the public Tribunals, Heads are cut in the Walls with gaping Mouths,
into which they cast the Notes of Information. If the Informer has no Scruple
to declare him∣self, he goes in Person to receive the Reward allowed by Law
on this Occasion; if he does not choose to be known, he sends a Friend,
with a Piece of Paper that has been torn from that on which the Information was
written, <PB N="285" REF="292"/> and the Money is paid without any other
For∣mality than comparing the two Pieces of Pa∣per together. As the great Maxim
of the <HI>Ve∣netians</HI> is, that the Safety of the State depends upon their
having exact Intelligence of every Thing that passes, especially in the
Families of Ambassadors and foreign Ministers, it is in∣credible what a
Number of Spies of all Ranks they keep in constant Pay. That the
<HI>Vene∣tians</HI> are often branded with the ridiculous Epithet of
Pantaloons, for this apparent My∣steriousness in their System of
Politics, we very well know; but how far they are right or wrong in it, I leave
to better Judgments than mine to determine: this however we must allow, that
their Government has subsisted under a re∣publican Form, without any
material Alteration, for a much longer Period of Time than any other Republic
that History furnishes us with an Account of, at least that I can
recollect. I had a great Curiosity, when I came to <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> to learn
the Etymology of the Name of <HI>Pantaloon,</HI> and why it is so
particularly applied to the <HI>Venetians</HI>; I am told it comes from
<HI>Pianta Leone,</HI> and was first appropriated to them for their great
Eagerness to plant the <PB N="286" REF="293"/> Standard of <HI>Venice,</HI>
which you know is a Lion, wherever they could by Force or Fraud ob∣tain a Bit
of Ground large enough to con∣tain it. How far this etymological Account of
honest <HI>Pantaloon</HI> may satisfy you, I know not; but, remember, I do
not vouch for the Reality of it, I only offer it to you as I have received it.
I propose by the next Post to send you a succinct Account of the
Me∣thod of proceeding at <HI>Venice</HI> in criminal Cases, and am, in the
mean Time,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>faithfully yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIV. Miss N— to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>May</HI> 1, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AN agreeable Excursion for a few Days into the Country has
prevented my being so punctual in my literary Engagement as I have hitherto
been; but I make no Aplogy, <PB N="287" REF="294"/> for I know you never meant
it should interfere with my Amusements. Now to proceed with my historical
Anecdotes.</P>
<P>PROCEEDINGS in CRIMINAL CASES at <HI>VENICE.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a Crime is supposed to have been committed at
<HI>Venice,</HI> the Courts of Justice are more solicitous to be
ascertained of the Fact, than to secure the Offender; and when they have
obtained the necessary Proofs, they send an Officer to enter publicly the
House of the Criminal; and on the Report of this Officer, that he is not be
found, (which is generally the Case) they summon him to ap∣pear in a longer
or shorter Space of Time, according to the Enormity of the Crime com∣mitted,
to answer for the Offence, and till that Period is elapsed, the Offender is
safe from any Molestation, provided he does not appear on the Place of St.
<HI>Mark,</HI> or on the <HI>Rialto</HI>; and he may also demand three
De∣lays, and if he thinks he cannot find Means to prevent the Affair coming to
a fatal Issue, <PB N="288" REF="295"/> he may avoid a Trial, by getting a
Noble∣man's Boat to convey him to some Part of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> from
whence he may easily escape out of the State. Hence it proceeds, that
most Criminals at <HI>Venice</HI> are judged by Contumacy, which they call
<HI>Bandire:</HI> but this Judgment is always accompanied with Condi∣tions
proportionable to the Crime; for exam∣ple, that the condemned Person shall
never be able to purchase his Pardon; that whoever kills him in the
<HI>Venetian</HI> State shall receive a considerable Reward, and double the
Sum, if they kill him in any other Territory. If the Crime sensibly touches
the Republic, they add to the Reward, the Liberty of delivering a
State-Prisoner: but notwithstanding this ap∣parent great Rigour, there have
been Instances of Noblemen who have been guilty of atro∣cious Crimes making
their Peace, by Means of great Interest. When the Criminal is se∣cured, and
the Process formed, the <HI>Avogador</HI> names his own Day, and, conducting
the Cul∣prit before his Judges, pleads strongly against him, exaggerates
every Particular of his Crime, and concludes with advising a severe
Punish∣ment. The Advocate of the Party accused <PB N="289" REF="296"/>
answers all the chief Points of the Accusa∣tion; and when he has performed
his Part, the Auditors retire, and the Opinion of the <HI>Avogador</HI> is
balloted against that of the Chiefs of the <HI>Quarantia,</HI> which is
always the most gentle, and the Plurality of Balls determine the Fate of the
Offender. By this Means the Judges decide without giving the Reason of their
Opinion, and it is consequently un∣known who is for, and who is against the
Criminal. The Lawyers are obliged to plead in the <HI>Venetian</HI> Dialect,
that the most ignorant Auditor may understand what passes, as well as
the more learned Part of the Assembly. The severest Hardship, in the
Course of Jus∣tice at <HI>Venice,</HI> is the Length of Time it takes to
terminate an Affair, owing to the Courts of Justice being so closely
connected, and, if I may be allowed the Expression, playing into each
others Hands; so that a poor Wretch is often suffered to lie in Gaol for
two or three Years, before he can obtain an hearing, to expiate, as they
pretend, by this Punishment, part of his Crime. The frequent Sentences that
are passed upon Criminals, condemning them to an horrid obscure Prison
for eight or <PB N="290" REF="297"/> ten Years, and often for Life, (where in
Win∣ter they suffer all the Rigour of extreme Cold, and in Summer of
excessive Heat) are certainly more cruel Punishments than Death at
once.</P>
<P>Now in my usual abrupt Manner, I shall conduct you at one Step
from temporal to spiritual Affairs, and say a few Words of the Church,
whose Power is very limited in this Republic.</P>
<P>The STATE of the CHURCH.</P>
<P>THE Republic of <HI>Venice</HI> has ever been careful to exclude the
Clergy from their Coun∣cils, and from all political Employments, even those
who are noble <HI>Venetians.</HI> The Head of the Church is stiled Patriarch
of <HI>Venice,</HI> and Primate of <HI>Dalmatia</HI>; he is always a Noble∣man,
enjoys a good Revenue, makes a re∣spectable Appearance in public
Processions, but has no Power, even in ecclesiastical Af∣fairs; at all
religious Functions, where the Pope's Nuncio is present, the Patriarch is
obliged to send the Master of the Ceremo∣nies <PB N="291" REF="298"/> to
ask his Permission to give the Blessing. An Office of Inquisition
is allowed at <HI>Venice,</HI> but under such Restrictions, as render it as
dependent on the political Government as any of the secular Tribunals are.
The Holy-Office is composed of the Patriarch, the Nuncio, and a Friar, who
has the Title of Father In∣quisitor, and two experienced Senators, with∣out
whose Presence and Consent, all Proceed∣ings are null; by this Means, and
under this Pretext, that Matters brought before the In∣quisition are contrary
to the Laws and Inte∣rest of the Republic, the greatest Affairs of this
Tribunal are reduced to a mere Trifle. The Convents in <HI>Venice</HI> were
formerly so ill regulated, that it occasioned much Scandal; but at
present, they are under better Disci∣pline, for three Magistrates are
appointed by the Senate, with an extensive Authority, to take Cognizance of
all that passes in the fe∣male Monasteries; and though the Patriarch
himself allows a Priest to say Mass in one of their Churches, he is
obliged to obtain a Per∣mission from one of these Magistrates
besides, who limits this Licence to what Time he thinks proper. All the Women
likewise who <PB N="292" REF="299"/> perform any Commissions for the Nuns,
are obliged, under Penalty of corporal Punishment, to have Leave in Writing
to execute them, signed by one of the aforesaid Magistrates. The Senate
has, within these few Years, made many wise and useful Reformations in
the re∣gular Convents of Friars also; and have trans∣ferred from the
Superiors of those Houses to the Senate, the Power of inflicting capital
Pu∣nishments and Imprisonment upon the Monks, and only allow them for the
future to impose Penances of Fasting, Prayers, and such like conventual
Exercises.</P>
<P>Now we must return from spiritual to tem∣poral Affairs again,
that I may have the Ho∣nour to introduce you to the <HI>Venetian
No∣blesse,</HI> who are not a little vain of the great Antiquity of their
Nobility, which they can certainly, many of them at least, authenticate for
several Ages past, better than any other Nation we are acquainted with.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="300"/>NOBILITY of the FIRST CLASS.</P>
<P>THE noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> who compose the first Class,
comprehend the Families of the twelve Tribunes who elected the first Doge in
709: the <HI>Contarini, Morosini, Poli, Badovari, Tiepoli, Michele, Sanudi,
Gradenigo, Memo, Fa∣lier, Dondolo,</HI> and <HI>Barozzi.</HI> The four Families
next to these in Point of Antiquity, date their Nobility from the Year 800,
when they signed the Contract for the Abbey of St. <HI>George</HI> the Great;
these are the <HI>Justiniani, Cornaro, Bra∣gadini,</HI> and <HI>Bembo.</HI>
The first are popularly called the twelve Apostles, and the last the four
Evangelists. To this Class may be added also, eight Families who look
upon themselves as equal to the first, because long before <HI>il Serral
del Consiglio,</HI> which happened in 1289, they were very considerable;
these are the <HI>Del∣phini, Quirini, Soranzo, Zorzi,</HI> and
<HI>Marcello</HI>; the other three, by Reason of extreme Pover∣ty, are fallen
into total Obscurity, or perhaps are extinct: in this Class too, may be
placed some illustrious Families, who retired to <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> 
<PB N="294" REF="301"/> from the Town of <HI>Acre</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> when
it was destroyed by the <HI>Venetian</HI> General TIE∣POLI, for having
revolted from its Obedience to the Republic after the first Conquest of it.
The greatest Advantage these Families derive from their Antiquity is being
more considered in the Disposal of public Employments that reflect Honour
on the Possessors; in Point of Precedency, all the Nobility of
<HI>Venice</HI> rank alike.</P>
<P>NOBILITY of the SECOND CLASS.</P>
<P>THIS Class is composed of those who can produce no authentic
Proof of their Nobi∣lity earlier than 1289, when their Names were written in
the <HI>Libro d'Oro,</HI> which now contains more than five hundred Families.
It was at that memorable Event, <HI>il Serrar del Consiglio,</HI> that this
List of the Nobles was first made out, and a Law enacted, that if the Names
of their Children were not written in this Book within a certain Time after
their Birth, they should forfeit their Title to Nobi∣lity; and this also
happens, if the Contract <PB N="295" REF="302"/> of their Parents' Marriage does
not legally pass the Senate, which it cannot do, if a no∣ble
<HI>Venetian</HI> marries a public Performer, either in the Drama, or Music,
one who has been in a State of Servitude, or one whose Father is of any
Profession or Trade, excepting a Physician, a Manufacturer of gold or
silver Silks, or a Maker of Glass. As it is now upwards of four hundred
Years since <HI>il Serrar del Consig∣lio,</HI> this Class of Nobles is
highly esteemed. The most considerable of these Families that still
exist, are the <HI>Moncenigo,</HI> the <HI>Capello, Fos∣carini, Foscari,
Grimani, Gritti, Garzoni, Love∣dan, Dona, Nani, Malipiero, Pesoro, Pisani,
Priuli, Ruzzini, Sagredo, Valier, Venier, Bassa∣dona, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>
most of these have given Doges to the Republic, and the reigning one at
pre∣sent is a <HI>Moncenigo.</HI> In this Rank are also placed thirty
Families that were ennobled nine∣ty-one Years later, on the Termination of the
<HI>Genoese</HI> War, as a Reward for assisting the State with vast
Sums of Momey; the most considerable of these that are remaining are the
<HI>Trevisan, Vendramin, Renier, Justi,</HI> and
<HI>Pas∣qualighi.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="303"/>After having introduced you to so much good
Company, I think you will not be sorry if I take my Leave for the present;
but I cannot do that, without first assuring you, that I am, with Truth,
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXV. Miss N— to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>May</HI> 6, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TO proceed with my Subject where I left it in my last Letter, I
must now talk to you a little of a younger Branch of the <HI>Venetian</HI>
Nobility, whom I shall stile the third Class, and even these are
respectable for their Antiquity.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="304"/>NOBILITY of the THIRD CLASS.</P>
<P>IN this Class are comprehended about eighty Families, who
purchased their Nobility for an hundred thousand Ducats each, during the
last War of <HI>Candia</HI>; some of these have remained poor and
distressed ever since, by that Instance of their Vanity: the
following are still con∣siderable for their Wealth and Alliances, the
<HI>Videman, Labia, Zenobia, Fini, Manini, Gam∣bara, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> The
<HI>Savorgnan</HI> gave to the Republic some Fortresses of great
Importance, for guarding the <HI>Venetitian</HI> Territories from the
Encroachments of the <HI>Turks</HI>; and the <HI>Ben∣zoni</HI> made the State a
Present of the Pro∣vince of <HI>Crema,</HI> of which they possessed
the Seignory; and for these free Gifts the two Families received the Honour
of being enno∣bled. Though the noble <HI>Venetians</HI> can au∣thenicate the
Antiquity of their Nobility bet∣ter than any People perhaps in <HI>Europe,</HI>
yet not content with this Advantage, they are fond of deriving their Families
from fabulous Ori∣ginals: thus the <HI>Contarini,</HI> from a Similitude 
<PB N="298" REF="305"/> of Name, pretend to be descended from an∣tient
<HI>German</HI> Princes, who were stiled Counts of the <HI>Rhine</HI>; the
<HI>Justiniani,</HI> who give for their Arms a Spread Eagle, from thence
claim their Descent from an Emperor of the East of their Name. I have been
told a curious Anecdote of this noble Family, that I will relate for your
Amusement: some Centuries past, they fitted out a Vessel, under the
Doge VITAL MICHELE, to fight against the Emperor EMANUEL; (who had ill
treated the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the <HI>Levant)</HI> the
<HI>Justiniani</HI> were all cut to Pieces, and the only surviving Male was
a <HI>Benedictine</HI> Friar, for whom the Doge obtained a Dispensation of
his Vows from the Pope, and married him to his Daughter, and from this Couple
are descended the present Family, according to this Legend, which whether
true or false I shall not take upon me to deter∣mine. One Branch of the
<HI>Cornaro</HI> Family stile themselves <HI>Cornaro della Regina,</HI>
from one of their House having been Queen of <HI>Candia</HI>; but this
Alliance is rather a Blot in their Escutcheon, if a certain evil Fame may be
relied on, who says, that the Husband of this Lady was an Usurper, whom
she poisoned, and <PB N="299" REF="306"/> treacherously betrayed the
<HI>Candians</HI> to the <HI>Ve∣netians.</HI> A Gentleman has promised to
intro∣duce me to a Lady of this Name, who is a very agreeable, sensible
Woman, and who, he says, will shew me the complete Ornaments of the
Toilette of the Queen above-mentioned, which is still in the
Possession of the Family, and valued by them at many thousand
Ducats.</P>
<P>The CITIZENS, or ORDER of SECRETARIES.</P>
<P>THE Citizens had formerly a large Share in the Government, and
<HI>Venice</HI> would probably have always remained in a State of Democra∣cy,
had not the Resentment of PIETRO GRA∣DENIGO against many of the Class,
who op∣posed his being chosen Doge, determined him to transfer the Power
entirely from the Peo∣ple into the Hands of the Nobility, which he fully
effected by Means of the <HI>Serrar del Consiglio</HI>; at which Period,
several of the No∣bles lost their Rank, by not being admitted into the
Secret; and at present, by the Word Citizen, (at <HI>Venice)</HI> is meant
the Families thus <PB N="300" REF="307"/> excluded from the Grand Council, many
of whom bear the same Name and Arms of the old Nobility; and to these may
be added ma∣ny who by Merit or Money have obtained the same Privileges in the
Republic: they rank with the Nobility of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> and one at
least of every Family wears the Vest, the same as the noble
<HI>Venetians:</HI> it has been thought, this is allowed them to prevent the
People from observing how small a Num∣ber of Men they are governed by.
Though, by a standing Law, every noble <HI>Venetian</HI> is forbid to enter
into Trade, yet they often join privately in Commerce with the wealthy
Citi∣zens, which the Senate winks at, because when they are become opulent,
they can make it turn to the Advantage of the State, by employing them in
expensive Embassies. From among the Citizens are chosen the Secretaries
of the Senate, Secretaries of Embassies, and also Residents at foreign
Courts, for a noble <HI>Venetian</HI> can accept of no Employment of that kind,
but with the Title of Ambassador; and, for the same Reason, the
Republic receives no foreign Minister in any intermediate Cha∣racter between
a Resident and an Ambassador. <PB N="301" REF="308"/> The Dignity of Grand
Chancellor is always conferred on one of this Class; and as it is the
highest Honour that can be attained by a Person who is not noble, it is
generally given as a Reward to one who has served the Re∣public well in
expensive Residencies. The Sub∣jects of the <HI>Venetian</HI> State are by
some rated, at present, at about 2,655,448; but those who have made very
accurate Enquiries upon this Head affirm, that they are over-rated by one
million.</P>
<P>Thus, my Friend, I have obeyed your Com∣mands, and, in as concise
a Manner as I pos∣sibly could, have endeavoured to give you a just Idea
of the very extraordinary Govern∣ment of the Republic of <HI>Venice</HI>; I
flatter my∣self, that by offering you this at one View, I have saved you
the Trouble of turning over some Books which, besides being very dry
read∣ing, you might not easily have met with: but was this little Extract (or
whatever you are pleased to call it) to fall under the Ob∣servation of a
less indulgent Judgment than yours, I should, with great Reason, fear
being charged with having given it in a slovenly in∣correct Manner. I shall
only advance, in my De∣fence, <PB N="302" REF="309"/> that you well know how
limited my Time is at <HI>Venice,</HI> and how strongly my natural
Incli∣nation leads me to a much more entertaining Study than that of History;
but to such a Friend as yourself, I could not refuse a Gra∣tification
that it was in my Power to procure you, at the trifling Expence of putting
myself, for a few Hours, out of my Way; I only wish you may find my Attempt
satisfactory. However, before I entirely quit this Subject, I cannot forbear
communicating to you a few Re∣flections into which it has naturally led me; it
is melancholy to observe, that in a Govern∣ment so wise in many of its
Parts, such gross Errors should be suffered to pass uncorrected, as
must in Time most certainly destroy the whole System. A total Neglect
evidently ap∣pears in the Education of the young Nobi∣lity, which gives them an
Ignorance, I had almost said Brutality, that renders them very
disagreeable in civil Society, and must prove an Obstacle to their
becoming wise and pru∣dent Magistrates; and, added to this, the
Li∣centiousness not only permitted, but even en∣couraged, among the Clergy,
has produced such a shameful Neglect in Matters of true 
<PB N="303" REF="310"/> Religion, that Vice and Immorality seem to pre∣vail
among all Ranks of People, which must in Time infallibly bring to a final
Dissolution this once flourishing and powerful Republic. How amazingly
must the Manners of the <HI>Ve∣netians</HI> have been corrupted since their
first Establishment, if the Abbate LANGIER has drawn a true Character of
them in his <HI>Storia Veneta,</HI> P. 130, Libro 1. He says,
<HI>Esigevansi Costumi puri, Condotta semplice, una Vita labo∣riosia
per Ottenere da Lei la Qualita di Cittadino.</HI> The same Author quotes a
Letter, written by CASSIODORUS, who was Minister from King THEODORICK to the
Tribunes of the mari∣time Isles, which contains these Words, <HI>Più
di sussante piccole Isole essendo state Abitate
suc∣cessivamente intorno Rialto per componere al fire questa Cita
prodigiosa.</HI> P. 160. Libro 2. I have transcribed this only by Way of
observ∣ing how very early <HI>Rialto</HI> (now called <HI>Venice)</HI> became
a considerable Place. LANGIER places the Election of PAOLO LUCIO ANAFESTE,
the first Doge, in 697, which is twelve Years ear∣lier than St. DISDIER's
Account, who says, this Prince was elected in 709. AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI, in
his History of the Republic <PB N="304" REF="311"/> of <HI>Venice,</HI>
says, The Government of <HI>Venice</HI> by Consuls and Tribunes, which
lasted 270 Years, may be called her Infancy; the de∣spotic Reign of the
Doges, from PAOLO LU∣CIO ANAFESTE to SEBASTIAN RIANI, (which comprehends 463
Years) her Childhood; the Democracy, (which lasted above a Century) her
Youth, which, says he, was robust and vigo∣rous; but, as it often happens
in similar Cases, it was disturbed and agitated by dan∣gerous Paroxisms
of Wars and Revolts. Her Virility, he adds, began with <HI>il Serrar del
Con∣siglio,</HI> and lasted till the War of the League of <HI>Cambray,</HI>
in 1309, which may be called the Beginning of her old Age.</P>
<P>The Republic liberally rewarded SANAZAR for the following very
flattering Epigram: 
<Q> 
<L>Viderat <HI>Adriacis Venetum NEPTUNUS</HI> in Undis</L> 
<L>Stare Urbem &amp; toto dicere Jura Mari.</L>

<L>Si <HI>Tiberim</HI> Pelago confers, Urbem aspice utramque,</L>

<L>Illam Homines dices, hanc possuisse Deos.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="312"/>Thus hastily translated by a Gentleman of
my Acquaintance: 
<Q> 
<L>NEPTUNE within the <HI>Adriatic</HI> Seas</L> 
<L>Beheld fair <HI>Venice</HI> her rich Turrets raise,</L> 
<L>And seem o'er all the Main to issue her

<L>To equal this—bring thine own MARS's Wall—</L> 
<L><HI>Tarpeian</HI> Cliffs—immortal <HI>Tyber</HI>'s

<L>Where mighty <HI>Rome</HI> her deep Foundations laves,</L>

<L>Thy proudest Toils by what I guard outdone;</L> 
<L>Works but of human Skill thy Bulwarks stand,</L> 
<L>Mine boast the Touch of an immortal Hand.</L></Q></P>
<P>As I am very partial to this famous Re∣public, even in her present
faulty State, I can∣not do better than to take my Leave of her, after paying
her so high a Compliment; and at the same Time shall bid you, my dear
Friend, adieu for some Time, as I propose leaving <HI>Venice</HI> in a few
Days, and from what Place I shall next write to you, I cannot at pre∣sent
foresee. Farewel, believe me, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My dearest Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE kind Expressions in your welcome Epistle, and
superabundant Thanks for my <HI>Venetian</HI> Extract, were, I assure
you, a Cor∣dial to my Heart. I am rejoiced that our worthy Patroness has
passed so good a Win∣ter, and hope the Summer will be still more
propitious to her.</P>
<P>You will see by the Date of this Letter, we have changed our
Situation, and are got to a sweet Retirement, on the Banks of the
<HI>Brenta</HI>; the House is large, convenient, clean and chearful; the
Gardens spacious, and in good Order; and the whole Atmosphere per∣fumed
with Roses, Jasmines and Orange Flo∣wers, which we have in great
Profusion. The River, which is in the Front of the House, affords a
continual moving Picture of large <PB N="307" REF="314"/> Barges, passing to
and fro from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Padua,</HI> from either of which Places we
can have any Thing brought by Water to the very Door. The north Side of the
River is planted with Forest Trees, and the south Side with Vines that hang
in beautiful Festoons, supported by other Trees: in short, we want
nothing but a few liberal Souls (such as di∣stinguish the Party you are
with) in this Neigh∣bourhood, to render this delicious Spot an abso∣lute
terrestrial Paradise; yet, I am sure, whilst you have the Advantage of
such a Socie∣ty, you would not exchange your retired Spot for all I have been
describing; and in this Preference, I join with you most cordially, and beg
my best Love to all the dear Mem∣bers that are so happy to be collected
within the magic Circle.</P>
<P>A hasty Summons (on Account of the De∣parture of the Packet that
contains this Tri∣fle) obliges me to use more Brevity than I am either
accustomed or inclined to. I can∣not, however, send it off without
enclosing a Piece of News, that I flatter myself is not quite indifferent
to you; namely, that, please God <PB N="308" REF="315"/> no unforeseen
Accident intervenes, in a twelve-month's Time, at farthest, I may probably be
so happy as to salute you all in your usual dear Assembly-Room. Be
persuaded, however, of this simple Truth, that whether the Time I am
absent from you all is long or short, or the Distance great or small, I
am ever, and shall always remain, with the same Affection and
Sincerity,</P>

<P>Pray let me have the Pleasure to hear from you soon.</P>
<P>P. S. By the Bye, I have a Favour in the Transcript-Way to
entreat of <HI>you.</HI> You do not forget, I am sure, that, previous to my
setting off for <HI>Venice,</HI> I was hurried about (my usual Fate) from
Spot to Spot, and sent you occasional Accounts of such Places and Events
as I thought best worth your Notice. A dear Friend here wishes to see
them: now, as some Time is elapsed, it would save my Head as well as Hand
much Trouble, if you would oblige me with Copies of those Let∣ters, 
<PB N="309" REF="316"/> provided you have thought them worth preserving: I

<DATE><HI>July</HI> 5.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK myself so much obliged to you, for you taking so much
Notice of my insignificant Scrawl, that I am not the least inclined to find
fault with the Length of Time you have taken in answering my last; and to
shew my Sincerity in this Particular, I am sat down to acknowledge your
Favour, though I have not had it in my Possession longer than this
Afternoon, for it has lain some Time in <HI>London.</HI> I have been on a
Visit to a worthy Friend of ours, at this Place, for a Month 
<PB N="310" REF="317"/> past, and I assure you, I have all the Rea∣son
in the World to be satisfied with my Journey. Pray, good Sir, did you ever
see <HI>Bridgenorth?</HI> I believe not—Very well; then I must give
you some little Description of this Place, (as I am habituated to do of
every new Spot I tread upon, whether large or small) for I think
<HI>Bridgenorth</HI> is, in Point of Situ∣ation, by much the prettiest I ever
saw; it is divided into two Parishes, distinguished by the Names of the
Upper and Lower Town. I was, the other Day, on a Visit to the Rec∣tor of the
upper Parish; the Parsonage-House is a truly Gothic Structure, which
overlooks the Church-Yard, and though I cannot say, this is the most
<HI>pleasant,</HI> yet it certainly is not the least <HI>useful</HI>
Prospect in the World, to a speculative Mind. The upper Town is situ∣ated
on a Cliff, which renders it very whol∣some, both from its Height, and the
Clear∣ness of the Air. The View from our back Windows is more beautiful than
any Thing you can imagine: at the Foot of the Hill, the <HI>Severn</HI> rolls
its crystal Waves, in a charm∣ing serpentine Stream, down to the Banks
whereof, is a Succession of sloping Gardens, <PB N="311" REF="318"/> that
vie with each other in Beauty, Fragrance, and Order. On the opposite Side, in
a Vale, lies the lower Town, and above that are de∣lightful Fields and Meadows,
interspersed with fine Plantations of Trees of a long Growth. The Grounds,
by an easy Ascent, terminate at last in a Common, fifteen Miles long, on
which is a very good Horse-Course; to the left, the Prospect is bounded
by a very high Rock, and on the right, as far as the Eye can stretch, is a
fine open fertile Country; this strong Contrast has a most happy Effect.
A noble Object in this inimitable Landscape is the Ruin of an old Castle,
which, from the Position wherein it has been left by a Can∣non-Ball, is,
perhaps, one of the greatest Cu∣riosities in <HI>Europe</HI>; it strikes
us with Admi∣ration and Awe, while we contemplate its nod∣ding Towers, which
look as if they meant to overwhelm the heedless Passenger in sudden
De∣struction; yet the <HI>Mathematicians</HI> affirm, that nothing less
than an Earthquake can move this immense Pile of Building. Round it is a
de∣lightful Walk, where we often repair when the Weather is inviting; but when
this happens not to be the Case, we have for our Amuse∣ment, 
<PB N="312" REF="319"/> in the House, a <HI>Microscope,</HI> a reflecting
<HI>Tellescope,</HI> and a <HI>Camera Obscura:</HI> the first of these
is my Favourite; Mr. L—, by the help of it, the other Day, detected a
<HI>Beau</HI> of an <HI>Humble Bee,</HI> in the very Act of scratching a
<HI>Louse</HI> (Oh, shameful Truth!) off the downy Part of his Neck, and
this little Animal, though scarcely perceptible to the naked Eye, is a most
<HI>tremendous</HI> Figure, much resembling a Hog, in the Glass; for my
Part, though I am not apt to be attracted by gaudy Co∣lours, I am absolutely
in love with the ra∣diant Armour of a green <HI>Beetle,</HI> richly gilded,
with a Sun-Beam. I own to you, my good Friend, I have a hearty Contempt for the
<HI>Cox∣combs</HI> of the human Race, who place all their Happiness in
Dress, when I consider that an humble Moth, in the simple Habit which
Nature has given it, far outshines them in all the Glitter of Lace and
Embroidery.</P>
<P>Whenever we amuse ourselves with these Sort of Contemplations,
our <HI>worthy Neighbour the Pastor,</HI> never fails to make Improvement go
Hand in Hand with Amusement, by ta∣king Occasion to expatiate on the
Wisdom and <PB N="313" REF="320"/> bounteous Goodness of our great Creator,
ex∣emplified in the most minute, as well as in the greatest Objects of
Nature. This excellent Man edifies his Parishioners as much by the exemplary
Life he leads, as by the sound and <HI>orthodox</HI> Doctrine he delivers
from the Pulpit, and he does this with the most chearful Dis∣position
that can be, and totally free from the least Shadow of
<HI>Ostentation</HI>; we attend him every Morning to public Prayers in the
Church.</P>
<P>Now, my good Friend, I have given you a very particular Account of
my present Situa∣tion, and leave it to you to judge, if it is not very
agreeable. I must add to this, that I got here Time enough for the Races,
where there was a great Appearance of Company, (for such a Place;) though Men
were scarce, I got a Partner each Night. Lord STAMFORD's Family were the
first in Rank. Lady MARY GREY opened the Ball, and I had the Honour to dance
a Minuet with Mr. GREY, the first Night: indeed, I have met with so much

<P>I HAVE been some Time without hearing from you. I hope the
excellent Presi∣dent of our Society is not laid up with her old Plague, the
Gout. If social Worth could ward off Malady, she would never be ill. 
<PB N="315" REF="324"/> Perhaps you have not been in the Writing-Vein; such a
Fit attacks us all at Times, and you know it is our Rule reciprocally to allow
for it. If that is the Case, do but sub∣scribe the Initials of your Name
to a good, though short Account of yourselves, and I will rest
contented.</P>
<P>I know not what I said in my last, but to the best of my
Rememberance, I gave you no Account of this terestrial Paradise; but now I
am more acquainted with its Beauties, I will make an Attempt of that Sort.</P>
<P>The 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sweet winding Tay,</HI>"</Q> which runs at the
Bottom of our Garden, for upwards of six Miles, forms the most beautiful
Canal you can imagine; on the one Side of it, for the same Extent, are
delightful Walks, rising one above another, no less than five Stages, all
amply shaded with stately Trees, from around whose Trunks the twining
Woodbine and Sweet-Briar pours forth a Profusion of Sweets; the sloping
Sides of the Walks are also planted with Va∣riety of sweet-smelling
Shrubs, which being fanned by the fresh Breezes off the River, 
<PB N="316" REF="325"/> scatter Perfumes in a plenteous and grateful Return,
along the verdant Banks. At judicious Distances are placed grassy Seats,
moss-grown Cells, and flowery Arbours, all which, in their several Turns,
would invite us to sit down and indulge Contemplation, but that the
un∣wearied Mind, enraptured with these enchan∣ting Objects, urges us to
proceed in Search of new Beauties, and in that Pursuit it cannot here meet
with the slightest Disappointment. The opposite Side of the River is a
deep Bank, finely fringed with Wood of a younger Growth; at different Points of
View, we see the <HI>Brawn,</HI> another beautiful River, and a foaming
Cas∣cade; each paying the Tribute of their lucid Stores into the crystal
Bosom of the <HI>Tay,</HI> who, as if conscious of superior Merit, trips
nimbly along, in Murmurs of Self-Applause. This charming Prospect is at
last closed with Views of distant Ruins, Hills covered with Trees,
fertile Vales, and Mountains of a most vene∣rable Appearance, covered with a
Heath so beautiful, that it may vie with the glowing Amaranthus. The Gardens
are very extensive, and laid out in the finest Taste, that is to say,
with Grandeur and Simplicity united. <PB N="317" REF="326"/> Nature appears here
in her loveliest Attire, and Art is contented to act in her proper Sphere, as
Handmaid to the Goddess. We seldom drink Tea in the House; sometimes an
elegant Tent and <HI>Marquis</HI> is pitched at some fine Point of View;
sometimes we resort to a fine banqueting Room, and often the Shade of a
large spreading Oak has the Pre∣ference. Upon these Occasions the Duke
al∣ways reads and we work. What most attracts my Admiration here is, to
perceive that in every surrounding Object, Utility adds Merit to Beauty: the
Farm-Houses on this Estate are neat as the Hand of Industry can make
them, and chearful as the Smiles of Content; and every Creature that breathes
upon this Spot seems to participate in the unfeigned Happiness of the
excellent Possessors, whose Goodness adds the highest Lustre to
Wealth and Title that they are capable of receiving. It was well said,
whoever made the Observation, that a good Action never loses its reward;
here was I sat down, full of Love and Re∣spect to write my dearest
Friends a dutiful and loving Letter, when lo, and behold! I was made happy by
the Receipt of yours; and <PB N="318" REF="327"/> truly rejoiced I am to find,
that my Fears are groundless; however, I don't feel happy at the Thought of
our Society's meeting with any Interruption to its Pleasures. Believe my
Assurance sincere, when I affirm, that I think the <HI>Content</HI> which
reigns therein, far excels in Value the highest Gratifications that Shew and
Grandeur can bestow on its restless Votaries. Pray have you ever read DE
TOUCHE's Co∣medies? I am positive such excellent Subjects, modelled for our
Stage, would be of public Emolument, and I should hope, would be productive
of both Honour and Profit to the Undertaker. I am afraid, by what you say of
<HI>Dunkeld,</HI> I gave you an Account of its Beauties in my last, if so,
this will be a hor∣rid, stupid Repetition; in that Case, commit me to the
Flames without the least Remorse of Conscience. I hope the Sight of a
Letter directed by the Pen of a fine young Gen∣tleman, won't give you any
Alarm; I con∣fess it has done so by me, since this new fashioned Way of
franking. Adieu! In more Haste than can be expressed, believe me ever</P>

<DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 10, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW strong and wonderful, my good Friend, is the Force of Habit! I
re∣member, near upon my Departure from the dear Society in
<HI>Somersetshire,</HI> I felt an auk∣ward Kind of—I don't know
what—when it was proposed that I should maintain a con∣tinual
Correspondence with <HI>one of the other Sex,</HI> during my Absence. I
felt this, even in spite of the Conviction, that writing to <HI>you,</HI>
was, in fact, but writing to the <HI>whole Circle.</HI> How idle!—Now
that I have done so, for some Time, I have taught myself to address
you, with as little Reserve, as if you were my <HI>real,</HI> instead of my
<HI>nominal</HI> Uncle. So much the better—Reserve was not made for
true Friendship, and liberal Minds, and with none but such do I
correspond.—So much by Way of Digression; now, to return to my
little Travels.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="329"/>We have been these six Weeks past at
<HI>Atholl</HI> House, a very magnificent Seat of the Duke's, twenty Miles
higher up in the High∣lands than this Place is; though it far ex∣ceeds
<HI>Dunkeld</HI> in Grandeur, yet I own the rural Beauties of the latter, have
more Charms for my humble Disposition; Providence ha∣ving, no doubt,
designed me to tread the 
<Q REND="inline">"Cool sequestered Vale of Life,"</Q> has bounded
my Ideas accordingly, and I look upon this as one of the numberless
Instances I have ex∣perienced of the Divine Bounty. The Coun∣try about
<HI>Atholl</HI> is very romantic and beauti∣ful; in some Places rather wild,
in others very fertile, which forms a fine Contrast. The House is
immensely large, the Rooms are in∣finite in Number, finely proportioned, and
elegantly furnished throughout; 'tis situated in a very extensive Vale,
amply wooded, and or∣namented with four beautiful Rivers, all of which, at
different Places, lose themselves in the <HI>Tay.</HI> Some of them from
the Tops of very high Mountains receive a prodigious In∣crease from the
finest natural Cascades you can imagine, which is a Sight extremely
beautiful, <PB N="321" REF="330"/> and at the same Time very tremendous. The
Kitchen-Garden is the finest Thing of the Kind that in my Life I ever saw;
elegant Sum∣mer-houses, Alcoves, Octagons, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> often
tempted us to drink Tea abroad, and enjoy the fine extensive Views at
Leisure. I should have told you, that the Vale is surrounded with Hills
and Mountains, at such a Distance, that in∣stead of confining the
Prospect, they add great∣ly to the Grandeur of it.</P>
<P>I must not omit to mention a natural Cu∣riosity I here met with,
of a very extraordinary Kind: M' PHERSON, Laird of <HI>Foignes,</HI> two Years
before the Peace, raised eight and twen∣ty Men to serve in
<HI>America</HI>; who unanimously declared when they came to embark, that
they would not have enlisted, had they not thought they should have
served under <HI>him</HI>; the ge∣nerous Laird was so struck with this
Proof of their Attachment, that he declared they should not be
disappointed, and, at the Age of seventy-two, asked Leave to serve as a
Vo∣lunteer; during the Remainder of the Cam∣paign he was present in every
Action, was always ready to expose his Person, and never 
<PB N="322" REF="331"/> was a single Day prevented by Illness from doing his
Duty; the Government has reward∣ed his spirited Generosity with a
<HI>Lieutenancy,</HI> and Leave to retire upon full Pay, so that now, like
the Patriarchs of old, he wages more harmless Wars with the feathered Race
and swift-footed Stag: now, at near fourscore Years of Age, he is able to
walk and scram∣ble amongst the Mountains, the whole Day, in Pursuit of
Game. How few, my good Friend, of our degenerate Countrymen, are at such an
Age able to serve their King and Country! Enervated by Sloth and Luxury, long
before that Period of Life, they become a Burthen to themselves, and a
Torment to all about them. When I looked at the military Garb and venerable
silver Locks of this northern Hero, I fancied I saw in his single
Person an Epitome of all the illustrious <HI>Greeks</HI> that served in
the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI>; and if my Heart had been inclined to change its
present Situa∣tion, I verily believe I should without Hesi∣tation have
bestowed it upon this warlike Mountaineer.</P>
<P>I fear the Season is now approaching, when our friendly
Association must lose some of its <PB N="323" REF="332"/> agreeable
Ornaments; I feel for the Mortifi∣cation a <HI>sensible</HI> Mind must
suffer, at being obliged to quit the Society of a favourite <HI>few,</HI> to
mix with the unthinking many: but hope that the kind Genius of Friendship
will inter∣pose a Gleam of Pleasure, at the Prospect of a future
Meeting.</P>
<P>My Love to all, you know, is a constant Commission, and I am
sure you will never forget to discharge it. How is that best of good
Beings, our President, our Patroness, our Life, our Spirit, our all? Is
she not the wor∣thiest of Heaven's Worthies? Was there ever Acquaintance
who did not esteem her, Friend who did not love her, Domestic who did not
bless her, or Indigent, who came to her Door, that did not pray for her? Long
may she remain with us! and whenever it pleases Pro∣vidence to remove her
from Earth, may she receive Blessings in a future State, in as ample
Portions, as she, through Life, has ever wished and endeavoured to
dispense them to her Fellow-Creatures.</P>

<P>DID you ever expect to hear of, or from me again? Ever since I
received your last, I have lived the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife of a Whirlagig, but be
assured that I had not a Moment to tell you so. The dear Spot I left was
al∣ways in my Thoughts, and indeed as yet my poor Brain is far from being in a
composed State; a scribbling Moment too is the only good Thing that is
scarce here. A few Days after I received yours we left the calm Sweets of
<HI>Dunkeld,</HI> and went to pay a second Visit at Lord BREADALBANE's,
where all was Mirth, Music, Masquerades, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> From
thence we set forth on our Return towards a southern Sun, and gentler
Breezes, and stopped for a few Days at the elegant and superb Seat of Lord
BINGLEY, near <HI>York</HI>; there we found a brilliant Assembly of Ladies
and Gentlemen, <PB N="325" REF="334"/> who had met to dine and play Cards,
how∣ever, most of them went away in the Evening, and we remained a decent
Party for the rest of the Time; from thence we bent our Course to this
magnificent Castle, hoping, wishing, and expecting, to find a quiet,
peaceable Family till <HI>Christmas,</HI> when we knew a deli∣cious Riot was
always intended; but lo, and behold! here we found his Highness of
<HI>York,</HI> Lord and Lady CHARLES SPENCER, Lady CHATHERINE, and Mr.
BEAUCLERK, Lord and Lady LUDLOW, and a World more of fine Folks; the very
first Night we were forced to join in a Ball, and every Day, whilst his
Highness stayed, we had Music in the Morn∣ings, and Cards or Dancing at
Night; I be∣lieve every Creature was fatigued with Plea∣sures, and I can
answer for one who was glad when it was over; the Duke of YORK was so
pleased with his Entertainment, that it is not impossible but he may
return at <HI>Christmas.</HI> We are now a sober decent Party of ten or
twelve, and, like rational Beings, read and work in the Evenings; and, to
shew you that all this Dissipation does not totally banish serious
Thoughts, we have Prayers con∣stantly <PB N="326" REF="335"/> every Morning in
a beautiful Chapel in the Castle. I take it for granted, that you know, all
this Time, that the Owner of this Palace is the Duke of MANCHESTER, who is a
very amiable young Nobleman, his Bro∣ther, Lord CHARLES MONTAGU, is no less
so, the Duchess is beautiful, polite, and a very good young Woman; but the
Character that I could dwell upon with Delight for Ages, is Lady CAROLINE
MONTAGU, the Duke's Sister. If ever perfect Goodness chose to dwell with
mere Mortality, one may imagine it inhabits her Breast; and I flatter
myself, that you will not conceive the worse Idea of her Ladyship, when I
tell you, that she honours me with a very particular Friendship, unworthy
as I am of such a valuable Distinction. Don't think I flatter, for I am
perfectly sincere, when I assure you, that I often think, amidst this
perpetual Round of gay Amusements, with infinite Regret of the dear
<HI>social Party,</HI> where∣with I have spent some of the happiest and
most rational Moments of my Life; I gave such a Picture of it to a young
Man of <HI>great Quality</HI> and <HI>good Sense,</HI> a little while ago,
that he made me pass my Word, if ever we met <PB N="327" REF="336"/> at
—, to introduce him to the Lady Pa∣troness of the agreeable
<HI>Society.</HI> I beg my best Affections to all the dear Associates; I
rejoice, without the least Mixture of Envy, at my worthy Namesake's happy
Prospects, and sincerely wish she may enjoy every Feli∣city the
<HI>holy Estate</HI> can possibly produce. I hope I need not say, that
a Letter from you always gives me Pleasure; you will, I am sure, indulge me
between this and <HI>Christmas.</HI> Pray tell me, in your next, if Mr. QUIN
is not alive; besides the Concern I should feel for his Death, I am engaged
in a Wager about it.</P>
<P>I am become such a wandering Vagabond over the Face of the Earth,
that I should not be a Bit surprised to find myself conveyed suddenly
to the utmost Extent of the habita∣ble Globe: I fear, I shall be less
fortunate than NOAH's Dove; she, at last, found Rest for the Sole of her
Foot, but I doubt I shall not, till my Soul has taken its Flight to some
more happy Region; I assure you I meant no Pun, but I see one has fallen
from my Pen of its own Accord. I heard from our <PB N="328" REF="337"/> Friends
in — since I got here, and have the Satisfaction to find they are all
well.</P>
<P>I would attempt to give you some Idea of this Place, but there is
a Magnificence and Extensiveness in it, that goes far beyond the Capacity
of my Pen. The Castle is a very large and regular Building, the
Connoisseurs say the Architecture is very just; 'tis expen∣sively
furnished, though not in the modern Taste; there are many good Paintings
that this Duke bought in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Parks, Lawns, <HI>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</HI> are judiciously planted, and laid out in a good Taste; I find
the present Possessor has made many Improvements, and is making
still more. The Plate and Apparatus for the Table is more superb than any
Thing of the Kind that I have ever seen, and the Table is always elegantly
covered; but I must confess, this is the Kind of Luxury that pleases me
the least, and I often think, how much more healthy, and consequently
happier, our Forefathers were, than their degenerate Proge∣ny, who live upon
<HI>Ragouts, Fricasses,</HI> and high-seasoned Meats.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="338"/>Adieu! If you are tired with my moralizing,
you will not be sorry, that both my Time and Paper obliges me to assure
you, that I am, with the sincerest Truth, your ever obliged</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW write to you from this Metropolis of <HI>Dirt</HI> and
<HI>Gentility,</HI> which, owing to the Narrowness of the Streets and Height
of the Houses, puts me more in mind of the Ca∣pital of <HI>North</HI> than of
<HI>South Britain</HI>; but then the <HI>Grands Hotels</HI> are more noble, and
in greater Abundance than our Noblemen's Houses; and the Environs of
<HI>Paris</HI> are, in my Opi∣nion, finer than those of <HI>London,</HI>
which Place <PB N="330" REF="339"/> we left on <HI>Thursday</HI> the 17th of
this Month, and arrived here on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 22d, with∣out meeting
any disagreeable Accident during the Journey. We have got a very elegant
Apartment in one of the best Parts of <HI>Paris,</HI> and, you may be sure,
have lost no Time since our Arrival, in seeing every Thing that is worthy
a Stranger's Curiosity. The <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> of which <HI>French</HI>
Novellists make such frequent Mention, is a pleasant Place for the People
of Fashion to take the Air in. The <HI>Louvre,</HI> which, in outward Shew,
far exceeds any Palace we have, runs along one End of it, and on the opposite
Side a fine Square is building, called the <HI>Place de Louis Quinze</HI>;
there are noble shady Walks, and a charming Terrass, that commands a fine
View of <HI>Paris</HI>; but the old Taste, in which the Center of the Garden
is laid out, is frightful, and exactly resembles the Ornaments of a
Minced-Pye. There is another fashionable Rendezvous for the Evening Airings,
about a Mile out of <HI>Paris,</HI> that, I confess, pleases me still
more, called the <HI>Bois de Bullogne,</HI> where, instead of a sharp
Gravel and crowded Walks, like our Park, you may wander about 
<PB N="331" REF="340"/> at full Liberty, and tread upon a verdant Car∣pet all
the Time, which to tender-footed Folks makes a great Difference. We have seen
se∣veral private Collections of Paintings, and other Curiosities, that do
great Honour to the Taste and Judgment of the Possessors: but nothing
charms me so much, as a noble Collection of Pictures at the <HI>Palais
Royale,</HI> which belongs to the Duke of ORLEANS, first Prince of the Blood,
and were chiefly purchased by the famous Regent. The grand Opera here is the
finest Thing to see one can possibly imagine; the Scenes are
splendid, the Dresses rich and elegant, the Dances composed with
infinite Taste, and finely executed, and the Stage much better filled than
ours: but the Music is truly detestable; 'tis all <HI>French,</HI> and from
the Beginning to the End like a solemn Dirge. As for the Voices, if you will
imagine a Concert composed of Cats, Owls, and Monkeys, it will give you a
tole∣rable Idea of the Harmony, and whoever as∣sassinates your Ears
with the greatest Violence is most applauded. The <HI>French</HI> comic
Opera is as agreeable as the serious one is the re∣verse. The Songs are all
sprightly <HI>Italian</HI> <PB N="332" REF="341"/> Airs; the Scenery and
Dresses, as at the other, excel ours, and to my Fancy, this is the most
agreeable Amusement <HI>Paris</HI> affords; their Manner of acting Plays, I
own, does not charm me, after being used to the genteel, familiar Dialogue of
our <HI>English</HI> Comedies; and even in Tragedy, I think they have too
much Ener∣gy, both of Voice and Action. I should not thus familiarly play the
Critic, were I not perfectly well acquainted with your Candour and Good-nature;
for, after all, I am talking of what I don't understand, and am as likely to
be wrong as right. So much by Way of Digression, a Liberty all modern
Novellists allow themselves; and now my Narrative pro∣ceeds to the Chapter
of Fashions, for the Sake of the female Members of your Party. The Ladies in
general would, I believe, be hand∣some, but for two shocking Dabs of
Crimson, or Scarlet, which some prefer, in a circular Form, directly under
each Eye, which makes them look just like so many Furies; the Hair
dressed out of all Proportion, for often the Height of the Hair is more a
great Deal than the Length of the whole Face; even <HI>I,</HI> who am quite
moderate, am at least three Inches <PB N="333" REF="342"/> of
<HI>Toupée</HI> taller than I was when I left <HI>Eng∣land</HI>; the
Hoops are very small, the Ruffles very moderate, and the Necks more covered
than in <HI>England</HI>; the Gowns are made very high behind, and pin pretty
close before, and almost as wide at Bottom as at Top; the Pleats of the
Sacks behind are made narrower than ours. The married Ladies (indeed we never
see any other in public) all wear very small Caps. The Court being in
Mourning, prevents our seeing any other finery than Dia∣monds, in which the
Ladies seem to abound, in general, more than in <HI>England.</HI> Not a Head
of any Sort have I yet seen that is not abso∣lutely plaistered with
Pomatum and Powder, those of the Poor as well as the Rich; I wonder the
Consumption of Flower in this Metropolis of well-dressed dirty People,
does not breed a Famine: the Streets are always so crowded with them, that
you would swear <HI>Paris</HI> was the most populous Place, and the
<HI>Pa∣risians</HI> the most idle Set of People, in the whole World. A
fashionable Custom here is, when the Comedy is finished, to drive to what
is called the <HI>Grande Boule Vert,</HI> one Side of which is shaded with
Trees, and the other filled with <PB N="334" REF="343"/> large Coffee-houses,
finely illuminated, where you see all Manner of Sport going forward, as
Eating, Dancing, Music, Puppet-Shows, Conjurers, Fireworks, Fire-Eaters,
Giants, Lil∣liputians, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> in short, you may be
amused, in about the Length of the Mall, from eight in the Evening till three
in the Morning; but the genteel Way is only to drive up and down the Walk
without getting out of your Car∣riage. I am afraid that my Description of
<HI>Paris,</HI> and its Amusements, will tire both your Eyes and your
Patience, at least, it has done so by me, and I have scribbled in such
a Hurry, that it is not fit to send; but I flatter myself, you would rather
have a Letter ill written, than none; I am mortified though, that it will
cost you a great deal more po∣stage than it is worth, and by the Time it
reaches you, we shall probably be pursuing our Journey, so that I cannot
hope to hear a Word of or from our dear Society till I get to <HI>Venice.</HI>
In the mean Time, I beg to be remembered in the kindest Manner, to every
Member, and that you will believe me to be, as I ever am, with Truth and
Sincerity, yours and the Society's truly affectionate and obliged</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE greatest Pleasure I can feel during my Exile is to hear good
Accounts fre∣quently of those Friends in <HI>England</HI> that are most
dear to me. I hope you will answer this very soon, and be so good as to
direct your Letter to me as usual, under Cover to Mr. —, who has the
Care of sending our Letters to the Secretary of State's Office, by which
Means I receive my Letters much safer, than when they are not put in the
Packet. It is not yet quite three Months since I left <HI>England,</HI> and I
declare it appears to me three Years already; we were so fortunate, as to
perform our Journey without one unlucky Ac∣cident. On the twentieth of
<HI>July,</HI> of all Days in the Year, we began our Peregrinations, and
arrived here on the twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> after stopping about five
Days on the Road, to <PB N="337" REF="346"/> see different Places that were
worthy of Ob∣servation. We made no small Figure, I as∣sure you, at
setting out; our Train consist∣ing of two Post-Coaches and two
Post-Chaises: to our no small Amusement, we were mistaken for
Foreigners all the Way to <HI>Dover,</HI> which, I suppose, was owing to
our wearing large <HI>French</HI> Caps without Hats, and our Gentlemen being
dressed in loose <HI>French</HI> Coats, which are the most convenient
Kind of Dress for tra∣velling. We were not quite three Hours cros∣sing
the Water; the Quickness of the Passage scarcely made up for the
Roughness of it, which was really frightful, even to me, who am no
despicable Sailor for a <HI>Female</HI> In short, I was the only Person
well enough to nurse, which was very necessary for the other Females in
our Party. At <HI>Calais</HI> we found two excellent Berlins waiting to conduct
us to <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> in which we proceeded with our two
<HI>English</HI> Chaises. Our Route was quite different from that by which
we once went from <HI>Strasbourg</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> to my no small
Joy, for I think a twice-gone Road almost as bad as a twice-told Tale. I had
an Op∣portunity, by this Means, of seeing Beauties in <PB N="338" REF="347"/>
<HI>Champaigne,</HI> which, till then, I had no Idea of; for many Miles the
Road formed an actual Terrass, bounded on one Side by little Hills,
interspersed with Vineyards and Corn Fields, and on the other Side, the Eye
is led, by a gentle Descent, down to the most fertile Vales, the Verdure of
which could scarcely be con∣ceived from the Painting of pastoral Poetry;
through these, for an immense Way, meanders a most beautiful serpentine
River, whose Banks are adorned with innumerable Droves of Cat∣tle of every
Sort, which puts one in Mind of the peaceful Reign of the Patriarchs, since,
being undivided, they appear to be the Pro∣perty of <HI>one</HI> Master. You
will scarcely think, my good Friend, that these smiling Scenes could
raise melancholy Ideas, and yet they had that Effect upon my Mind; in
almost every Village we passed through, which had looked beautiful at a
Distance, we found all the Appearance of Wretchedness and Want that you
see in the most dreary Parts of <HI>Savoy,</HI> for what the Extravagance
and Luxury of the Prince of CONDE (part of whose immense Ter∣ritory this
is) leaves to the Peasants, is wrecked from them by the lazy Priests, who,
like Lo∣custs, <PB N="339" REF="348"/> seem to be sent only to eat up the
Riches of the Land; here you see no hospi∣table Gentleman's Seat; no warm,
neat Cot∣tages; those are Comforts reserved only for the
<HI>English,</HI> who would, perhaps, be more grate∣ful for the Blessings
they enjoy, if they pos∣sessed fewer of them. But to return to our
Journey; the fine Season of the Year, good Roads, and every where tolerable
Accommoda∣tions, carried us in twelve Days to <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> where we
stopped for three Days, and where you may, if you please, suppose we
shall re∣main till you hear from me next, as I shall defer the Rest of my
Account of our Jour∣ney for a future Letter.</P>
<P>The Masking is just begun, and two comic Operas, and two
Play-Houses opened; I have been once at the Opera, and caught such a Cold,
(partly, I suppose, a Tribute to the Sea∣son of the Year, and partly to
Change of Cli∣mate) that, for fear of the like Accident, I shall frequent
Theatres very little, unless I am tempted by a Party.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="349"/>I fear, my dear Friends, your Patience will be
quite tired out before you get to the Con∣clusion of this very long Letter;
but as I can only send a <HI>single Letter,</HI> I could not re∣sist
taking the largest Paper, and I cannot bear to send it you blank.</P>
<P>I am just in the disagreeable Situation I was this Time two
Years, when I was so happy to be with you, almost all my worldly Goods
being at the Mercy of the Waves, and the Ship ought to have been here at
least a Month ago. Adieu, my dearest Friends; may you en∣joy every earthly
Good, and may we be mu∣tually happy in a joyful Meeting, is the ear∣nest
Wish and Prayer of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>your sincerely affectionate S.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIII. Miss N— to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 26, 1772.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Received with infinite Pleasure, my dear Friends, your very kind
Letter; the good Account you give of yourselves is really and truly a
<HI>Happiness</HI> to me, and you have my sincere Prayers and good
Wishes, that your Health and Spirits may daily improve. I make no Doubt, but
your Tour was a de∣lightful one: there is about you, our sweet Patroness, a
certain Chearfulness and Good-humour that proceeds immediately from the
Heart, that not only illuminates her own Dis∣position, but inspires
those about her with the most pleasing Sensations the human Mind is
capable of feeling. I beg of you to present my best Affections to the
Doctor and Mrs. W—, and assure them, that I take the sincerest
Part in their Affliction; my good <HI>Papa</HI>'s filial Piety always appeared
to me a <PB N="342" REF="351"/> shining Part of his Character—my Love
and sincere good Wishes attend every Member of the <HI>dear Society</HI>;
would to God I could say, I had any Prospect of being soon re-united to
that best of all possible Societies: but, alas! that is not to be hoped
for: what <HI>must be, must be,</HI> and I make no Doubt 'tis right.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Friend, I must beg of you to take a Step back with me
to <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> for there, I think, we parted last; from thence we
steered our Course to <HI>Ball,</HI> (or <HI>Bazill,</HI> as it is called
in the Maps) in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> This Change in our Route delighted me,.
We were induced to make this little Round, to avoid a great Part of
<HI>Swabia,</HI> where we heard the Roads were almost impassable, the
Water un∣wholsome, a great Scarcity of Provisions, and the Measles raging
every where; <HI>Ball</HI> is ex∣tremely well worth the Observation of
Travel∣lers; the Situation is on a very noble Part of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which
runs through the Town; it also merits the Attention of the Lovers of
<HI>Virtù,</HI> as the best Relict of the famous HOL∣BENS (known by
the Name of <HI>Death's Dance)</HI> is preserved in the public Library. From
<HI>Ball</HI> <PB N="343" REF="352"/> we proceeded to <HI>Schafhausen,</HI>
another of the protestant <HI>Swiss</HI> Cantons; about three Miles hence
is the Cataract of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> an Ob∣ject which I contemplated with a
Mixture of <HI>Horror</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI> easier to be felt than
described, which I beg you will tell my <HI>Papa</HI> conveyed to me a
clearer Idea of the <HI>Sublime and Beautiful,</HI> than I could ever gather
even from Mr. BURKE. We next travelled a very pleasant Road, and caught many
fine Views of the famous Lake <HI>de Constance:</HI> but upon the whole,
though I like <HI>Swisserland</HI> well enough, <HI>en-passant,</HI>
there is an unpolished melancholy Air, even in the greatest Towns, that is
disgusting. When we got into the <HI>Tyrrol,</HI> every Thing lost the
Charm of Novelty to me, and I had only the mortifying Reflection to make, that
when I last passed those rugged Paths, I was going towards
<HI>England,</HI> and now, alas! was going from it. As we met with no
Adven∣tures new or surprising, I will trouble you with no further
Particulars of our Journey, save that we arrived at <HI>Venice</HI> the
twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> after being exactly a Month on the Road,
without meeting with one Overturn, bro∣ken <PB N="344" REF="353"/> Axeltree, or
other sinister Accident what∣ever.</P>
<P>And now let me say a few Words for my∣self, independent of
Company. Since the twen∣ty sixth of <HI>December,</HI> every Creature here,
that has Spirits enough to be so, has appeared quite mad; indeed,
<HI>Venice</HI> (in Carnival-Time espe∣cially) is only fit for those who
can place their Happiness in <HI>Vice, Folly,</HI> and
<HI>Dissipation</HI>; indeed, I am not only a professed, but a
sin∣cere Enemy to these three: you will believe me, when I tell you, that I
am horridly out of my Element here, and I feel the greatest Conviction, that
I shall never taste a hearty Satisfaction, till I again enjoy our rational,
dear friendly Society; but I fear the Time is very far distant when I shall
be allowed to par∣take of such enviable Amusements. You know I mean, in
this Declaration, only to refer to the Customs of the Place, not to the Party
where∣with I came, which is indisputably as rational and amiable as
<HI>can</HI> be enjoyed, uninterrupted with Hurry of <HI>Place</HI> and
ceremonial Visitors. I believe you have often heard me mention a Mrs.
S—, a very particular Friend of mine, <PB N="345" REF="354"/> who has been
settled here many Years, and now, having lost a Husband in his
ninety-ninth or hundredth Year, she is preparing to return to
<HI>England</HI>; we have talked so much and so often of you all, that
she is persuaded she is ac∣quainted with you, and begs me to give her
Compliments to you; and I verily believe, she will be tempted when she
arrives, to make you a friendly Visit.</P>
<P>I am ashamed to send you such a horrid Scrawl, but I have
wrote it by Snatches, with most vile Implements; the Date will faith∣fully
shew you it was begun on the twenty∣sixth of <HI>January,</HI> and now I am
concluding it on the ninth of <HI>February,</HI> so that you may be
assured, though I <HI>seem</HI> dilatory in writing, I, by no Means,
intend to <HI>be</HI> so. I was in Hopes to have popped this into a
Dispatch: but, alas! they are grown scarce Commodities at our House.</P>
<P>We have no less than three Operas and four Play Houses open;
and, would you believe it! I am grown so <HI>old</HI> or so
<HI>stupid,</HI> that I pre∣fer a Book or a Pen by the Fire-Side, to 
<PB N="346" REF="355"/> any of them. I am much abused for this Want of
Taste; but so hardened a Sinner am I, that it grows every Day stronger on
me. Adieu, my dear good Friend; may every Fe∣licity and Blessing attend you
all! Such is the sincere Prayer of your ever</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>faithful and affectionate S.
