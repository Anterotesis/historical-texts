<HEAD>The CLAIMS of the People of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the present century, (anno 1701, 12 W. III.) a sensible and loyal Writer drew up a small Tract of political information, which he intitled — <Q>THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND <HI>essayed in a Letter from the Country.</HI></Q> But, before the Tract was printed, the Author had the satisfaction to hear, that the <HI>Claims,</HI> he had asserted, were in many respects established by a new Act of the Parliament then sitting; which sea∣sonable attention to the People's <HI>Rights</HI> he most gratefully acknowledged in a Post∣script to his Letter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Act of Settlement,</HI> by virtue of which the present Royal Family succeeded to the Crown of these Realms, was the Statute, which then so happily (in the opinion of that Writer) <Q>secured THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.</Q></P>
<P>It is intitled, <Q><HI>An Act for the farther Limitation of the Crown, and better se∣curing the Rights and Liberties of the Subject;</HI></Q> — and accordingly contains
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>eight very excellent Articles of <HI>Limitation,</HI> agreeable to <Q><HI>the Claims of the People of England;</HI></Q> which, it seems, were en∣acted, <Q><HI>with the unanimous Concurrence of both Houses of Parliament,</HI></Q> for the ex∣press purpose of <Q><HI>securing our Religion, Laws, and Liberties.</HI></Q></P>
<P>One of these Articles ordained—"That" <Q>—<HI>all matters and things relating to the well governing of this</HI> Kingdom, <HI>which are properly cognizable in the Privy Coun∣cil by the Laws and Customs of this Realm, shall be transacted there, and all Resolu∣tions taken thereupon shall be signed by such of the Privy Council as shall advise and consent to the same.</HI></Q><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This excellent provision would effectually prevent any <HI>secret Council,</HI> or Faction, from becoming <HI>efficient without Responsibility.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>And by another of these Articles it was ordained — <Q><HI>That no person, who has an Office, or Place of profit, under the King, or receives a Pension from the Crown, shall be capable of serving as a Member of the House of Commons.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It might perhaps have been objected at that time, as well as at present, that such a <HI>total exclusion of Place∣men</HI> would withdraw from Parliament the Council and Assistance of many worthy Men <HI>in Office,</HI> (or that ought to be <HI>in Office,</HI>) whose parliamentary Abilities are the most distinguished and eminent in the Kingdom. Yet there is and obvious answer to this objection, viz. That it is very easy for a free Parliament (if in their wisdom they shall think it proper) to permit the <HI>great Officers of State,</HI> or even <HI>their Secretaries or first Clerks</HI> to have seats in Parliament, and, as Members, not only to declare their opinions, but also, for the better information of the House, even to <HI>debate</HI> and <HI>reply</HI> upon all questions relating to public affairs; which might be allowed without any dangerous effect, pro∣vided they are duly restrained from the single privilege of VOTING. The Nation by this means may have ample be∣nefit in the exercise of their great and shining abilities, without risque of <HI>undue influence,</HI> which cannot justly be attributed to mere <HI>argument,</HI> as that has no other weight or effect than what is fairly due to its merit; and any unrea∣sonable <HI>length of speech,</HI> whenever it is used with an appa∣rent intention to procrastinate and obstruct the intention of the Majority, may be duly restrained at the pleasure of the House. But otherwise, (i. e. without some due restriction, and, more especially, <HI>without an absolute exclusion from the power of voting,</HI>) a TREASURY BENCH, or any other BENCH OF PLACEMEN, in the House of Commons, is a <HI>manifest</HI> ABOMINATION, utterly repugnant to all just Ideas of a <HI>free uninfluenced Parliament,</HI> and consequently is highly derogatory to the honour of that House!</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>But, as the Parliament was at that time invested with the dangerous unconstitutio∣nal power of a <HI>triennial</HI> duration without <HI>Re∣election,</HI> it was impossible that the <HI>Elected</HI> (who thereby acquired a temporary indepen∣dency of the <HI>Electors,</HI> and, of course, too ma∣ny of them, a <HI>separate interest</HI> of their own) could long continue <HI>real</HI> Representatives of the <HI>People's Claims;</HI> and, consequently, these two most excellent provisions against <HI>undue influence</HI> were unhappily repealed, a very
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>few years afterwards, in the 4th year of Queen Anne (c. 8.) Which amply proves, that the most salutary provisions for <Q><HI>the Claims of the people</HI></Q> cannot be securely established under <HI>triennial</HI> or <HI>septennial</HI> Par∣liaments; and, of course, that the antient usage of <HI>sessional</HI> ELECTIONS is a <HI>Claim,</HI> of all others the most essentially necessary for our welfare.</P>
<P>Since the fatal repeal above mentioned, the prevalence of <HI>undue influence</HI> hath so rapidly and enormously increased, that the ever-loyal Citizens of London thought it their duty, in the year 1770, to bear testi∣mony against it; and accordingly they assert∣ed, in a public declaration to the King him∣self, that <HI>"the"</HI> (then) <Q><HI>House of Commons did</HI> NOT <HI>represent the people.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>Representatives of the People are essential to the making of Laws, and there is a Time when it is morally demonstrable that Men cease to be Representatives. That Time is now arrived. THE PRESENT HOUSE OF COMMONS DO NOT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE.</Q> —Address of the Mayor, Aldermen, &amp;c. of the City of London, 1770.</NOTE></P>
<P>Subsequent Facts have demonstrated the absolute necessity we are now under to <HI>claim</HI> and promote an <HI>unequivocal</HI> abolition of all <HI>undue Influence</HI> in Parliament.</P>
<P>Measures, the most <HI>unrighteous,</HI> as well as the most <HI>ruinous</HI> that could have been de∣vised,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>have been adopted and carried on under a pretended sanction of <HI>parliamentary Authority,</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">This must of course be understood to refer (if you please) only to <HI>former</HI> Parliaments that began the Mischief, whose <HI>pretended Sanction</HI> had more of the <HI>Name</HI> than the <HI>Reality</HI> of <HI>parliamentary Authority,</HI> if a <HI>real Representation of the Commons</HI> be at all essential to constitute a true <HI>legal Par∣liament.</HI>
<P>The Representatives are chosen by a <HI>very small Propor∣tion</HI> of the People, and even that <HI>small Proportion</HI> of People is so monstrously <HI>unequal</HI> in their <HI>power of delegation,</HI> that the small Number of 5723 Borough Voters elect 254 Re∣presentatives, which is very near <HI>half</HI> the Number of Re∣presentatives that are due to six Millions of People, and <HI>more than half,</HI> or a <HI>Majority,</HI> of the Numbers that are ever known to attend at any one Time. The INJUSTICE of such an <HI>enormous Disproportion</HI> in the Representation of the whole People cannot be parallelled by any other gross Ab∣surdity, except THE INIQUITY of rendering that <HI>dispro∣portionate Representation</HI> still more contemptible and nuga∣tory by SEPTENNIAL or (what were nearly as pernicious) TRIENNIAL, instead of the ancient constitutional Usage of SESSIONAL, ELECTIONS.</P></NOTE> which have involved both King and People (whose true interests are inseparable) in the most alarming difficul∣ties: and the ostensible Agents in the mis∣chief have obstinately persevered to the ut∣most extension of <HI>ability,</HI> until public Di∣sasters, and a happy preventive incapacity of their own, (their Heads and Funds being equally exhausted of council and resource,) have compelled them to make a temporary retreat; though the nu∣merous
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>Corps of Placemen, Pensioners, Contractors, &amp;c. occasionally procured them a shameful Majority almost to the last!</P>
<P>Hence it is evident that the <HI>Corruption of Parliament</HI> is the real source of all our national calamities and grievances, which cannot therefore be relieved by a <HI>mere change of Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Minority</HI> in Parliament hath once before, in the memory of most men, be∣come the <HI>Majority;</HI> and the worthy Op∣posers of bad measures were indulged with a temporary administration of public Affairs, until the secret <HI>efficient Cabinet</HI> could reco∣ver from the surprise and dismay of their former defeat in Parliament, and, by a renewed exertion of their <HI>undue influence,</HI> were able to shackle the new Administra∣tion with the rueful alternative, either to abandon their newly-acquired dignities, or else to adopt such measures as must effec∣tually deprive them of the people's confi∣dence; after which they were contemp∣tuously compelled (one by one, or as it might best suit the purposes of the reigning system of <HI>undue influence</HI>) to yield up their places for the emolument of the more pliant creatures of the secret faction.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>It would be madness for <HI>Englishmen,</HI> af∣ter such galling experience, to neglect their just and indispensible <HI>Claim</HI> to some imme∣diate and effectual precaution against similar <HI>delusions.</HI> To trust another new Adminis∣tration, without insisting at the same time on a constitutional <HI>limitation of power,</HI> by a <HI>free uninfluenced Representation of the Commons,</HI> may be dangerous to our very existence as an independent Kingdom!</P>
<P>The reduced circumstances of the Na∣tion cannot admit the risque of another such credulous experiment!</P>
<P>It is therefore become absolutely neces∣sary, for the security both of King and Peo∣ple, (which includes the <HI>true interest</HI> of all parties,) that the just <HI>"Claims of the Peo∣ple"</HI> be satisfied in an immediate Restora∣tion of the antient <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>responsible</HI> Go∣vernment, by a <HI>Revival</HI> of the two repealed Articles of the Act of Settlement, above recited, and by a <HI>Revival</HI> also of that most excellent Statute for SESSIONAL PARLIA∣MENTS, passed in the 4th of K. Ed. III. c. 14. declaring, <HI>"that a Parliament"</HI> (meaning a <HI>newly-elected</HI> Parliament, as the writs of those times incontestably demon∣strate) <Q><HI>shall be holden every year once, and more often if need be.</HI></Q> But this indispen∣sible
<PB N="10" REF="9"/><HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Claim</HI> of the People (for the Act itself is no more than an authentic <HI>De∣claration,</HI> or <HI>Acknowledgement,</HI> of an antient <HI>Right</HI>) cannot have complete <HI>effect</HI> without totally repealing an <HI>Act</HI> of the 8th year of K. Hen. VI. (cap. vii.) which, on <HI>false pretences,</HI> (whereby it is rendered unwor∣thy the title and dignity of a <HI>Statute,</HI>) dis∣franchised at once by far the greatest part of the English Nation, by robbing them of their BIRTHRIGHT,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the Act of Settlement, by virtue of which the pre∣sent King sits on the Throne, it is declared, that <Q><HI>the Laws of England are the Birthright of the people thereof:</HI></Q> and, according to an antient Maxim of the Common Law, this our <HI>Birthright in the Laws</HI> is to be esteemed our <HI>most valuable inheritance,</HI> superior to every other Denomination of PROPERTY. <Q><HI>Major Haereditas unicuique venit a jure et legibus quam a parentibus.</HI></Q> Lord Coke says it <Q>— is <HI>the best Birthright the subject hath; for thereby his Goods, Lands, Wife, Children, his Body, Life, Honour and Estimation, are protected from injury and wrong:</HI></Q> and then he cites the maxim— "<HI>Major Haereditas, &amp;c.</HI> 2 Inst. p. 56. An Act of Parliament, therefore, which sets up an <HI>inferior</HI> and mere <HI>pecuniary property</HI> as the object of <HI>representation,</HI> not only in <HI>preference,</HI> but to the total <HI>exclu∣sion</HI> of that <HI>superior property,</HI> or personal Right, which ought to be esteemed the <HI>most valuable inheritance,</HI> or <Q>BEST BIRTHRIGHT <HI>the subject hath,</HI></Q> &amp;c. is such a <Q><HI>malum in so,</HI></Q> such an iniquitous contempt and infringement of <HI>Common Right,</HI> against <HI>Reason and Justice,</HI> and against the express declaration of a <HI>fundamental principle of the English Constitution,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot fail to render the Act <Q><HI>null and void in itself,</HI></Q> if the People will but unite in maintain∣ing this just and legal plea against it; for which they have ample authority. See Doctor and Student, c. 10. where∣in it is declared, that <Q><HI>Statutes cannot exist against</HI> REASON <HI>or the</HI> LAW DIVINE,</Q>—<Q><HI>nec contra</HI> RATIONEM, <HI>nec contra</HI> LEGEM <HI>divinam existant:</HI></Q> for the execrable <HI>ini∣quity</HI> abovementioned is surely <HI>against both;</HI> and there∣fore as <Q><HI>these two Laws</HI></Q> (the Law of <HI>Reason</HI> and the <HI>Law of God</HI>) <Q><HI>cannot abate or turn aside,</HI></Q>—<Q><HI>Hae duae Leges declinari non possunt,</HI></Q> (ib. c. 17.) it is manifest that the unjust Act is utterly unworthy to be named a <HI>Statute,</HI> and must needs be <HI>void,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Plowden has reported a variety of cases, wherein Acts of Par∣liament were esteemed <HI>void in Law</HI> through the want of <HI>truth</HI> in the <HI>recitals.</HI> See pages 398 to 400.</Q> (Sharp's Declaration, p. 237.) Which legal <HI>disqualification</HI> is obvious in the preamble to the Act in question.</NOTE> as it cannot otherwise be esteemed than a mere <HI>corruption,</HI> (or <HI>corruptela,</HI>) according to the ex∣press direction of the same approved Author in his 2d ch. — viz. — <Q><HI>Against this Law,</HI></Q> (i. e. the <HI>Law of Reason,</HI>) <Q><HI>prescription,</HI> STATUTE, <HI>nor custom, may not prevail; and, if any be brought in against it, they be not prescriptions,</HI> STATUTES, <HI>nor Customs, but</HI> CORRUPTIONS, (COR∣RUPTELAE,) <HI>things</HI> VOID <HI>and against Justice.</HI></Q> — Doct. et Stud. Eng. ed. 1668, p. 5.</NOTE> the inestimable <HI>Right</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>of voting for Representatives in Parliament, without which they cannot properly be esteemed <HI>Freemen,</HI> because the <HI>Laws,</HI> their BIRTHRIGHT and <HI>most valuable Property,</HI> may be <HI>changed, suspended,</HI> or <HI>entirely with∣drawn from them,</HI> without their consent; whereas, in antient times, they enjoyed not only the privilege of voting, in <HI>plen Countie, (i. e.</HI> the full County-court or Parlia∣ment of each County,) for the Knights of the Shire, but frequently also for the Citi∣zens
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>and Burgesses, elected in their respec∣tive Counties; whereby the <HI>Equality</HI> of <HI>Representation</HI> was then preserved; and may again be happily restored by some such equitable mode of transferring the represen∣tation of <HI>depopulated</HI> or notoriously venal Bo∣roughs to the Decision of their respective <HI>County courts.</HI> Which method of <HI>equalising Representation</HI> deserves preference to all others, because it is not liable to the odious charge of <HI>innovation,</HI> but, on the contrary, is authenticated by <HI>long-continued usage and legal Precedents of ancient times:</HI> and the same may be said of all the other changes already recommended in this Address.</P>
<P>By these approved and tried means, the just <HI>claims of the people</HI> may be <HI>amply,</HI> as well as <HI>easily,</HI> established; and the happy ef∣fects of such a perfect Reformation would be <HI>security</HI> and <HI>support</HI> to any <HI>virtuous</HI> Ad∣ministration: for it would prevent their just measures from being <HI>impeded</HI> and <HI>clogged</HI> by the secret machinations of any private <HI>Cabal,</HI> or Cabinet <HI>Faction,</HI> that might otherwise be <HI>efficient</HI> without <HI>Responsibility;</HI> and it would also exclude the interested op∣position of needy unprincipled persons, who at present can <HI>introduce themselves</HI> into P—l—m—t (if they can but find credit for
