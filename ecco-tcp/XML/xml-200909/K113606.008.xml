<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF INSECTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Caterpillars in General.</HEAD>
<P>IF we take a cursory view of insects in ge∣neral,
caterpillars alone, and the butterflies and moths they give birth to, will make
a third part of the number. Wherever we move, wherever we turn, these
insects, in one shape or another, present themselves to our view. Some,
in every state, offer the most entertain∣ing spectacle; others are
beautiful only in their winged form. Many persons, of which number I am one,
have an invincible aversion to caterpillars, and worms of every species:
there is something disagreeable in their slow crawling motion, for which
the variety of their colouring can never compensate. But others feel no
repugnance at observing, and even handling them with the most attentive
application.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>There is nothing in the butterfly state,
so beau∣tiful or splendid as these insects. They serve, not less
than the birds themselves, to banish so∣litude from our walks, and to
fill up our idle in∣tervals with the most pleasing speculations. The
butterfly makes one of the principal ornaments of oriental poetry; but, in
those countries, the insect is larger and more beautiful than with us.</P>
<P>The beauties of the fly may therefore very well excite our
curiosity to examine the reptile. But we are still more strongly attached
to this tribe, from the usefulness of one of the number. The silkworm is,
perhaps, the most serviceable of all other animals; since, from its
labours, and the manufacture attending it, near a third part of the world are
cloathed, adorned, and supported.</P>
<P>Caterpillars may be easily distinguished from worms or
maggots, by the number of their feet; and by their producing butterflies of
moths. When the sun calls up vegetation, and vivifies the various eggs of
insects, the caterpillars are the first that are seen, upon almost
every vegetable and tree, eating its leaves, and preparing for a state of
greater perfection. They have feet both before and behind; which not only
enable them to move forward by a sort of steps made by their fore and
hinder parts, but also to climb up ve∣getables, and to stretch themselves
out from the boughs and stalks, to reach their food at a <PB N="5" REF="7"/>
distance. All of this class have from eight feet at the least, to
sixteen; and this may serve to distinguish them from the worm tribe,
that never have so many. The animal into which they are converted, is always
a butterfly or a moth; and these are always distinguished from other
flies, by having their wings covered over with a painted dust, which gives
them such various beauty. The wings of flies are trans∣parent, as we see
in the common flesh fly; while those of beetles are hard, like horn: from
such the wing of a butterfly may be easily distin∣guished; and words
would obscure their dif∣ferences.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that caterpillars, whether in the reptile
state, or advanced to their last state of perfection into butterflies,
may easily be distinguished from all other insects; being animals
peculiarly formed, and also of a pe∣culiar nature. The transmutations they
undergo, are also more numerous than those of any insect hitherto
mentioned; and, in consequence, they have been placed in the third order of
changes by Swammerdam, who has thrown such lights upon this part of natural
history. In the second order of changes, mentioned before, we saw the
grass∣hopper and the earwig, when excluded from the egg, assume a form
very like that which they <PB N="6" REF="8"/> were after to preserve; and
seemed arrived at a state of perfection, in all respects, except in not
having wings; which did not bud forth until they were come to maturity. But the
in∣sects of this third order, that we are now about to describe, go through
a much greater variety of transformations: for, when they are excluded from the
egg, they assume the form of a small caterpillar, which feeds and grows
larger every day, often changing its skin, but still preserving its form.
When the animal has come to a cer∣tain magnitude in this state, it
discontinues eat∣ing, makes itself a covering or husk, in which it
remains wrapped up, seemingly without life or motion; and after having for
some time con∣tinued in this state, it once more bursts its con∣finement,
and comes forth a beautiful butterfly. Thus we see this animal put on no
less than three different appearances, from the time it is first excluded
from the egg. It appears a crawling caterpillar; then an insensible
aurelia, as it is called, without life or motion; and lastly, a butterfly,
variously painted, according to its different kind. Having thus
distinguished this class of insects from all others, we will first
sur∣vey their history in general; and then enter par∣ticularly into the
manners and nature of a few of them, which most deserve our curiosity and
attention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Transformations of the Caterpillar into its
corresponding Butterfly or Moth.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN winter has disrobed the trees of their leaves, Nature
then seems to have lost her in∣sects. There are thousands of different
kinds, with and without wings; which, though swarming at other seasons,
then entirely disappear. Our fields are re-peopled, when the leaves begin to
bud, by the genial influence of spring; and ca∣terpillars, of various
sorts, are seen feeding upon the promise of the year, even before the
leaves are completely unfolded. Those caterpillars, which we then see, may
serve to give us a view of the general means which Nature employs to
preserve such a number of insects during that season, when they can
no longer find subsistence. It is known, by united experience, that all
these animals are hatched from the eggs of butterflies; and those who
observe them more closely, will find the fly very careful in depositing
its eggs in those places where they are likely to be hatched with the
greatest safety and success. During winter, therefore, the greatest
number of ca∣terpillars are in an egg state; and in this lifeless 
<PB N="8" REF="10"/> situation, brave all the rigours and the humi∣dity of the
climate: and though often exposed to all its changes, still preserve the
latent prin∣ciples of life, which is more fully exerted at the approach of
spring. That same power that pushes forth the budding leaf, and the
opening flower, impels the insect into animation; and Nature at once seems
to furnish the guest and the banquet. When the insect has found force to
break its shell, it always finds its favourite aliments provided in abundance
before it.</P>
<P>But all caterpillars are not sent off from the egg in the
beginning of spring; for many of them have subsisted during the winter
in their au∣relia state: in which, as we have briefly observed above, the
animal is seemingly deprived of life and motion. In this state of
insensibility, many of these insects continue during the rigours of
winter; some enclosed in a kind of shell, which they have spun for
themselves at the end of autumn; some concealed under the bark of trees;
others in the chinks of old walls; and many buried under ground. From all
these, a variety of butterflies are seen to issue, in the beginning of
spring; and adorn the earliest part of the year with their painted
flutterings.</P>
<P>Some caterpillars do not make any change whatsoever at the
approach of winter; but con∣tinue <PB N="9" REF="11"/> to live in their reptile
state, through all the severity of the season. These chuse
them∣selves some retreat, where they may remain un∣disturbed for some
months together; and there they remain, quite motionless, and as
insensible as if they were actually dead. Their constitution is such,
that food, at that time, would be use∣less; and the cold prevents their
making those dissipations which require restoration. In ge∣neral,
caterpillars of this kind are found in great numbers together, enclosed in
one common web, that covers them all, and serves to protect them from the
injuries of the air.</P>
<P>Lastly, there are some of the caterpillar kind, whose
butterflies live all the winter; and who, having fluttered about for some
part of the latter end of autumn, seek for some retreat during the winter,
in order to answer the ends of pro∣pagation, at the approach of spring.
These are often found lifeless and motionless in the hol∣lows of trees,
or the clefts of timber; but, by being approached to the fire, they recover
life and activity, and seem to anticipate the desires of the spring.</P>
<P>In general, however, whether the animal has subsisted in
an egg state, during the winter; or whether as a butterfly, bred from an
aurelia, in the beginning of spring; or a butterfly that <PB N="10" REF="12"/>
has subsisted during the winter, and lays eggs as soon as the leaves of
plants are shot forward, the whole swarm of caterpillars are in motion to
snare the banquet that Nature has provided. There is scarce a plant that
has not its own pe∣culiar insects; and some are known to support
several of different kinds. Of these, many are hatched from the egg, at the
foot of the tree, and climb up to its leaves for subsistence: the eggs of
others, have been glued by the parent butterfly to the leaves; and they are no
sooner excluded from the shell, but they find them∣selves in the midst
of plenty.</P>
<P>When the caterpillar first bursts from the egg, it is
small and feeble; its appetites are in pro∣portion to its size, and it
seems to make no great consumption: but as it encreases in magnitude, it
improves in its appetites; so that, in its adult caterpillar state, it is
the most ravenous of all animals whatsoever. A single caterpillar will
eat double its own weight of leaves in a day, and yet seems no way
disordered by the meal.—What would mankind do, if their oxen or their
horses were so voracious!</P>
<P>These voracious habits, with its slow crawling motion, but
still more a stinging like that of nettles, which follows upon handling the
greatest number of them, make these insects not the most 
<PB N="11" REF="13"/> agreeable objects of human curiosity. However, there are
many philosophers who have spent years in their contemplation; and who have
not only attended to their habits and labours, but mi∣nutely examined their
structure and internal conformation.</P>
<P>The body of the caterpillar, when anato∣mically considered, is
found composed of rings, whose circumference is pretty near circular or
oval. They are generally twelve in number, and are all membraneous; by which
caterpillars may be distinguished from many other insects, that nearly
resemble them in form. The head of the caterpillar is connected to the
first ring by the neck; that is generally so short and con∣tracted, that
it is scarce visible. All the co∣vering of the head in caterpillars seems
to consist of a shell; and they have neither upper nor un∣der jaw, for
they are both placed rather verti∣cally, and each jaw armed with a large thick
tooth, which is singly equal to numbers. With these the animals devour
their food in such amazing quantities; and with these, some of the kind
defend themselves against their ene∣mies. Though the mouth be kept shut,
the teeth are always uncovered; and while the insect is in health, they are
seldom without employ∣ment. Whatever the caterpillar devours, these 
<PB N="12" REF="14"/> teeth serve to chop it into small pieces, and render
the parts of the leaf fit for swallowing. Many kinds, while they are yet
young, eat only the succulent part of the leaf, and leave all the fibres
untouched; others, however, attack the whole leaf, and eat it clean away. One
may be amused, for a little time, in observing the avidity with which they
are seen to feed; some are seen eating the whole day; others have their
hours of repast; some chuse the night, and others the day. When the
caterpillar attacks a leaf, it places its body in such a manner that the edge
of the leaf shall fall between its feet, which keeps it steady, while the
teeth are em∣ployed in cutting it: these fall upon the leaf, somewhat in
the manner of a pair of gardener's sheers; and every morsel is swallowed
as soon as cut. Some caterpillars feed upon leaves so very narrow, that
they are not broader than their mouths; in this case the animal is seen to
devour it from the point, as we would eat a radish.</P>
<P>As there are various kinds of caterpillars, the numbers of their
feet are various; some having eight, and some sixteen. Of these feet
the six foremost are covered with a sort of shining gristle; and are
therefore called the shelly legs. The hindmost feet, whatever be 
<PB N="13" REF="15"/> their number, are soft and flexible, and are called
membranaceous. Caterpillars also, with regard to their external figure, are
either smooth, or hairy. The skin of the first kind is soft to the
touch, or hard, like shagreen; the skin of the latter, is hairy, and as it
were thorny; and generally, if handled, stings like nettles. Some of them
even cause this stinging pain, if but approached too nearly.</P>
<P>Caterpillars, in general, have six small black spots
placed on the circumference of the fore ring, and a little to the side of the
head. Three of these are larger than the rest, and are convex and
transparent: these Reaumur takes to be the eyes of the caterpillar;
however, most of these reptiles have very little occasion for sight,
and seem only to be directed by their feeling.</P>
<P>But the parts of the caterpillar's body which most justly
demand our attention, are the stigmata, as they are called; or those holes
on the sides of its body, through which the animal is supposed to
breathe. All along this insect's body, on each side, these holes are
easily dis∣coverable. They are eighteen in number, nine on a side, rather
nearer the belly than the back; a hole for every ring, of which the animal's
body is composed, except the second, the third, and the last. These
oval openings may be con∣sidered <PB N="14" REF="16"/> as so many mouths,
through which the insect breathes; but with this difference, that as we have
but one pair of lungs, the caterpillar has no less than eighteen. It requires
no great anatomical dexterity to discover these lungs in the larger kind of
caterpillars: they appear, at first view, to be hollow cartilaginous tubes,
and of the colour of mother-of-pearl. These tubes are often seen to unite
with each other; some are perceived to open into the intestines; and some
go to different parts of the surface of the body. That these vessels
serve to convey the air, appears evidently, from the famous expe∣riment of
Malpighi; who, by stopping up the mouths of the stigmata with oil, quickly
suf∣focated the animal, which was seen to die con∣vulsed the instant
after. In order to ascertain his theory, he rubbed oil upon other parts of
the insect's body, leaving the stigmata free; and this seemed to have no
effect upon the ani∣mal's health, but it continued to move and eat as usual:
he rubbed oil on the stigmata of one side, and the animal underwent a
partial con∣vulsion, but recovered soon after. However, it ought to be
observed, that air is not so ne∣cessary to these as to the nobler
ranks of animals, since caterpillars will live in an exhausted re∣ceiver
for several days together; and though <PB N="15" REF="17"/> they seem dead
at the bottom, yet, when taken out, recover, and resume their former
vivacity.</P>
<P>If the caterpillar be cut open longitudinally along the back,
its intestines will be perceived running directly in a straight line from
the mouth to the anus. They resemble a number of small bags opening into
each other; and strengthened on both sides by a fleshy cord, by which
they are united. These insects are, upon many occasions, seen to cast
forth the internal coat of their intestines with their food, in the changes
which they so frequently undergo. But the intestines take up but a small
part of the animal's body, if compared to the fatty sub∣stance in which
they are involved. This sub∣stance changes its colour when the insect's
me∣tamorphosis begins to approach; and from white it is usually seen to
become yellow. If to these parts, we add the caterpillar's imple∣ments for
spinning, (for all caterpillars spin at one time or another) we shall
have a rude sketch of this animal's conformation: however, we shall
reserve the description of those parts, till we come to the history of
the silk-worm, where the manner in which these insects spin their webs,
will most properly find place.</P>
<P>The life of a caterpillar seems one continued succession
of changes; and it is seen to throw off <PB N="16" REF="18"/> one skin only
to assume another; which also is divested in its turn: and thus for
eight or ten times successively. We must not, however, confound this
changing of the skin with the great metamorphosis which it is afterwards to
undergo. The throwing off one skin, and assuming another, seems, in
comparison, but a slight operation among these animals: this is but the
work of a day; the other is the great adventure of their lives. Indeed, this
faculty of changing the skin, is not peculiar to caterpillars only, but is
common to all the insect kind; and even to some animals that claim a higher
rank in nature. We have already seen the lobster and the crab out-growing
their first shells, and then bursting from their confine∣ment, in order
to assume a covering more roomy and convenient. It is probable that the
louse, the flea, and the spider, change their covering from the same
necessity; and growing too large for the crust in which they have been
for some time enclosed, burst it for another. This period is probably
that of their growth; for as soon as their new skin is hardened round them,
the animal's growth is necessarily cir∣cumscribed, while it remains
within it. With respect to caterpillars, many of them change their skins
five or six times in a season; and <PB N="17" REF="19"/> this covering,
when cast off, often seems so complete, that many might mistake the
empty skin for the real insect. Among the hairy ca∣terpillars, for
instance, the cast skin is covered with hair; the feet, as well gristly
as mem∣braneous, remain fixed to it; even the parts which nothing but a
microscope can discover, are visible in it; in short, all the parts of
the head; not only the skull, but the teeth.</P>
<P>In proportion as the time approaches in which the caterpillar is
to cast its old skin, its colours become more feeble, the skin seems to
wither and grow dry, and in some measure resembles a leaf, when it is no
longer supplied with moisture from the stock. At that time, the insect
begins to find itself under a necessity of changing; and it is not
effected without violent labour, and perhaps pain. A day or two before the
critical hour approaches, the insect ceases to eat, loses its usual
activity, and seems to rest immoveable. It seeks some place to remain
in se∣curity; and no longer timorous, seems regardless even of the touch.
It is now and then seen to bend itself and elevate its back; again it
stretches to its utmost extent: it sometimes lifts up the head, and then
lets it fall again; it sometimes waves it three or four times from side to
side, and then remains in quiet. At length, some of <PB N="20" REF="20"/>
within from the view; but in others, where it is more transparent, the
caterpillar, when it has done spinning, strikes into it the claws of the
two feet under the tail, and afterwards forces in the tail itself, by
contracting those claws, and violently striking the feet one against the
other. If, however, they be taken from their web at this time, they appear in a
state of great languor; and, incapable of walking, remain on that spot
where they are placed. In this condition they remain one or two days,
pre∣paring to change into an aurelia; somewhat in the manner they made
preparations for changing their skin. They then appear with their bodies bent
into a bow, which they now and then are seen to straiten: they make no
use of their legs; but if they attempt to change place, do it by the
contortions of their body. In proportion as their change into an aurelia
approaches, their body becomes more and more bent; while their extensions and
con∣vulsive contractions become more frequent. The hinder end of the body is
the part which the animal first disengages from its caterpillar skin;
that part of the skin remains empty, while the body is drawn up contractedly
towards the head. In the same manner they disengage themselves from the
two succeeding rings; so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the animal is then lodged entirely in the <PB N="21" REF="21"/> fore part of its
caterpillar covering: that half which is abandoned, remains flacid and empty;
while the fore part, on the contrary, is swolen and distended. The animal,
having thus quitted the hinder part of its skin, to drive itself up into
the fore part, still continues to heave and work as before; so that the
skull is soon seen to burst into three pieces, and a longitudinal
opening is made in the three first rings of the body, through which the
insect thrusts forth its naked body, with strong efforts. Thus at last,
it entirely gets free from its cater∣pillar skin, and for ever forsakes its
most odious reptile form.</P>
<P>The caterpillar, thus stripped of its skin for the last
time, is now become an aurelia; in which the parts of the future butterfly are
all visible; but in so soft a state, that the smallest touch can
discompose them. The animal is now become helpless and motionless; but
only waits for the assistance of the air to dry up the moisture on its
surface, and supply it with a crust capable of resisting external
injuries. Im∣mediately after being stripped of its caterpillar skin, it is
of a green colour, especially in those parts which are distended by an
extraordinary afflux of animal moisture; but in ten or twelve hours after
being thus exposed, its parts harden, <PB N="20" REF="22"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="21" REF="23"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="24" REF="24"/> their
glutinous silk, make a kind of paste, in which they wrap themselves up.
Many are the forms which these animals assume in this help∣less
state; and it often happens, that the most deformed butterflies issue
from the most beau∣tiful aurelias.</P>
<P>In general, however, the aurelia takes the rude outline of the
parts of the animal which is contained within it; but as to the various
co∣lours which it is seen to assume, they are rather the effect of
accident; for the same species of insect does not at all times assume
the same hue, when it becomes an aurelia. In some, the beautiful gold
colour is at one time found; in others, it is wanting. This brilliant hue,
which does not fall short of the best gilding, is formed in the same
manner in which we see leather ob∣tain a gold colour, though none of that
metal ever enters into the tincture. It is only formed by a beautiful brown
varnish, laid upon a white ground; and the white thus gleaming through the
transparency of the brown, gives a charming golden yellow. These two
colours are found, one over the other, in the aurelia of the little animal we
are describing; and the whole ap∣pears gilded, without any real gilding.</P>
<P>The aurelia thus formed, and left to time to expand into a
butterfly, in some measure re∣sembles <PB N="25" REF="25"/> an animal in
an egg, that is to wait for external warmth to hatch it into life and vigour.
As the quantity of moisture that is enclosed within the covering of the
aurelia, continues to keep its body in the most tender state, so it is
requisite that this humidity should be dried away, before the little
butterfly can burst its prison. Many have been the experiments to prove
that nature may in this respect be assisted by art; and that the life
of the insect may be retarded or quickened, without doing it the smallest
injury. For this purpose, it is only requisite to continue the insect in
its aurelia state, by preventing the evaporation of its hu∣midity; which will
consequently add some days, nay weeks, to its life: on the other hand, by
evaporating its moisture, in a warm situation, the animal assumes its
winged state before its usual time, and goes through the offices
assigned its existence. To prove this, Mr. Reaumur enclosed the aurelia
in a glass tube; and found the evaporated water, which exhaled from the body
of the insect, collected in drops at the bottom of the tube: he covered the
aurelia with varnish; and this making the evaporation more difficult and
slow, the butterfly was two months longer than its natural term, in coming
out of its case: he found, on the other hand, <PB N="26" REF="26"/> that by
laying the animal in a warm room, he hastened the disclosure of the
butterfly; and by keeping it in an ice-house in the same manner, he delayed
it. Warmth acted, in this case, in a double capacity; invigorating the
animal, and evaporating the moisture.</P>
<P>The aurelia, though it bears a different ex∣ternal appearance,
nevertheless contains within it all the parts of the butterfly in perfect
form∣ation; and lying each in a very orderly manner, though in the smallest
compass. These, how∣ever, are so fast and tender, that it is
impossible to visit without discomposing them. When either by warmth,
or encreasing vigour, the parts have acquired the necessary force and
so∣lidity, the butterfly then seeks to disembarrass itself of those
bands which kept it so long in confinement. Some insects continue under the
form of an aurelia not above ten days; some twenty; some several months;
and even for a year together.</P>
<P>The butterfly, however, does not continue so long under the
form of an aurelia, as one would be apt to imagine. In general, those
caterpillars that provide hemselves with cones, continue within them but a
few days after the cone is completely finished. Some, however, remain buried
in this artificial covering for eight <PB N="27" REF="27"/> or nine months,
without taking the smallest sustenance during the whole time: and
though in the caterpillar state no animals were so vora∣cious, when thus
transformed, they appear a miracle of abstinence. In all, sooner or later,
the butterfly bursts from its prison; not only that natural prison which
is formed by the skin of the aurelia, but also from that artificial one of
silk, or any other substance in which it has enclosed itself.</P>
<P>The efforts which the butterfly makes to get free from its
aurelia state, are by no means so violent as those which the insect had
in changing from the caterpillar into the aurelia. The quan∣tity of moisture
surrounding the butterfly is by no means so great as that attending its
former change; and the shell of the aurelia is so dry, that it may be
cracked between the fingers.</P>
<P>If the animal be shut up within a cone, the butterfly always
gets rid of the natural internal skin of the aurelia, before it eats its way
through the external covering which its own industry has formed round it. In
order to observe the manner in which it thus gets rid of the aurelia
covering, we must cut open the cone, and then we shall have an opportunity
of discovering the insect's efforts to emancipate itself from its natural
shell. When this operation begins, there <PB N="28" REF="28"/> seems to be a
violent agitation in the humours contained within the little animal's body. Its
fluids seem driven, by an hasty fermentation, through all the vessels;
while it labours violently with its legs, and makes several other violent
struggles to get free. As all these motions concur with the growth of the
insect's wings and body, it is impossible that the brittle skin which
covers it should longer resist: it at length gives way, by bursting
into four distinct and regular pieces. The skin of the head and legs
first separates; then the skin at the back flies open, and di∣viding into
two regular portions, disengages the back and wings: then there likewise
happens another rupture in that portion which covered the rings of the back of
the aurelia. After this, the butterfly, as if fatigued with its struggles,
remains very quiet for some time, with its wings pointed downwards, and its
legs fixed in the skin which it had just thrown off. At first sight the
animal, just set free, and permitted the future use of its wings, seems
to want them entirely: they take up such little room, that one would wonder
where they were hidden. But soon after, they expand so rapidly, that the
eye can scarce attend their unfolding. From reach∣ing scarce half the
length of the body, they acquire, in a most wonderful manner, their full 
<PB N="29" REF="29"/> extent and bigness, so as to be each five times larger
than they were before. Nor is it the wings alone that are thus encreased: all
their spots and paintings, before so minute as to be scarce
discernible, are proportionably extended; so that, what a few minutes
before seemed only a number of confused, unmeaning points, now become
distinct and most beautiful ornaments. Nor are the wings, when they are
thus ex∣panded, unfolded in the manner in which ear∣wigs and grasshoppers
display theirs, who unfurl them like a lady's fan: on the contrary, those
of butterflies actually grow to their natural size in this very short
space. The wing, at the instant it is freed from its late confinement, is
con∣siderably thicker than afterwards; so that it spreads in all its
dimensions, growing thinner as it becomes broader. If one of the wings be
plucked from the animal just set free, it may be spread by the fingers,
and it will soon become as broad as the other, which has been left behind. As
the wings extend themselves so suddenly, they have not yet had time to
dry; and accord∣ingly appear like pieces of wet paper, soft, and full of
wrinkles. In about half an hour, they are perfectly dry, their wrinkles
entirely dis∣appear, and the little animal assumes all its splendor.
The transmutation being thus per∣fectly <PB N="30" REF="30"/> finished, the
butterfly discharges three or four drops of a blood-coloured liquid, which
are the last remains of its superfluous moisture. Those aurelias which
are enclosed within a cone, find their exit still more difficult, as they
have still another prison to break through: this, however, they perform in
a short time; for the butterfly, freed from its aurelia skin, butts with
its head violently against the walls of its artificial prison; and probably
with its eyes, that are rough and like a file, it rubs the internal surface
away; till it is at last seen bursting its way into open light; and, in
less than a quarter of an hour, the animal acquires its full per∣fection.</P>
<P>Thus, to use the words of Swammerdam, we see a little
insignificant creature distin∣guished, in its last birth, with
qualifications and ornaments, which man, during his stay upon earth, can
never even hope to acquire. The butterfly, to enjoy life, needs no other food
but the dews of Heaven; and the honeyed juices which are distilled from every
flower. The pageantry of princes cannot equal the orna∣ments with which it is
invested; nor the rich colouring that embellishes its wings. The skies
are the butterfly's proper habitation, and the air its element: whilst man
comes into the <PB N="31" REF="31"/> world naked, and often roves about without
habitation or shelter; exposed, on one hand, to the heat of the sun; and,
on the other, to the damps and exhalations of the earth; both alike enemies of
his happiness and existence.—A strong proof that, while this little
animal is raised to its greatest height, we are as yet, in this world, only
candidates for perfection!</P>

<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Butterflies and Moths.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been already shewn that all Butterflies are bred from
caterpillars; and we have exhi∣bited the various circumstances of that
sur∣prizing change. It has been remarked, that butterflies may be easily
distinguished from flies of every other kind, by their wings; for, in
others, they are either transparent, like gauze, as we see in the common
flesh fly; or they are hard and crusted, as we see in the wings of the
beetle. But in the butterfly, the wings are soft, opake, and painted over
with a beautiful dust, that comes off with handling.</P>
<P>The number of these beautiful animals is very great; and
though Linnaeus has reckoned up above seven hundred and sixty different
kinds, the catalogue is still very incomplete. Every collector of butterflies
can shew undescribed species: and such as are fond of minute
dis∣covery, can here produce animals that have been examined only by
himself. In general, however, those of the warm climates, are larger and
more beautiful than such as are bred at home; and we can easily admit the
beauty of <PB N="33" REF="33"/> the butterfly, since we are thus freed from
the damage of the caterpillar. It has been the amusement of some to collect
these animals, from different parts of the world; or to breed them from
caterpillars at home. These they arrange in systematic order; or
dispose so as to make striking and agreeable pictures: and all must
grant, that this specious idleness is far pre∣ferable to that unhappy
state which is produced by a total want of employment.</P>
<P>The wings of butterflies, as was observed, fully
distinguish them from flies of every other kind. They are four in number;
and though two of them be cut off, the animal can fly with the two others
remaining. They are, in their own substance, transparent; but owe their
opa∣city to the beautiful dust with which they are covered; and which has
been likened, by some naturalists, to the feathers of birds; by others, to
the scales of fishes; as their imaginations were disposed to catch the
resemblance. In fact, if we regard the wing of a butterfly with a good
microscope, we shall perceive it studded over with a variety of little
grains of different dimensions and forms, generally supported upon a
footstalk, regularly laid upon the whole sur∣face. Nothing can exceed the
beautiful and regular arrangement of these little substances; 
<PB N="34" REF="34"/> which thus serve to paint the butterfly's wing, like the
tiles of an house. Those of one rank are a little covered by those that
follow: they are of many figures: on one part of the wing may be seen a
succession of oval studs; on ano∣ther part, a cluster of studs,
each in the form of an heart: in one place they resemble a hand open; and in
another they are long or trian∣gular; while all are interspersed with
taller studs, that grow between the rest, like mush∣rooms upon a stalk.
The wing itself is com∣posed of several thick nerves, which render the
construction very strong, though light; and though it be covered over with
thousands of these scales or studs, yet its weight is very little
encreased by the number. The animal is with ease enabled to support
itself a long while in air, although its flight be not very graceful. When it
designs to fly to a considerable distance, it ascends and descends
alternately; going some∣times to the right, sometimes to the left, with∣out
any apparent reason. Upon closer exa∣mination, however, it will be found
that it flies thus irregularly in pursuit of its mate; and as dogs bait and
quarter the ground in pursuit of their game, so these insects
traverse the air, in quest of their mates, whom they can discover at more
than a mile's distance.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="35"/>If we prosecute our description of the
but∣terfly, the animal may be divided into three parts; the head, the
corselet, and the body.</P>
<P>The body is the hinder part of the butterfly, and is composed
of rings, which are generally concealed under long hair, with which that part
of the animal is cloathed. The corselet is more solid than the rest of
the body, because the fore wings, and the legs, are fixed therein. The legs
are six in number, although four only are made use of by the animal; the
two fore legs being often so much concealed in the long hair of the body,
that it is sometimes difficult to discover them. If we examine these
parts in∣ternally, we shall find the same set of vessels in the
butterfly that we observed in the caterpillar, but with this great
difference; that as the blood, or humours, in the caterpillar, circulated from
the tail to the head, they are found, in the but∣terfly, to take a direct
contrary course, and to circulate from the head to the tail; so that the
caterpillar may be considered as the embryo animal, in which, as we have
formerly seen, the circulation is carried on differently from what it is in
animals when excluded.</P>
<P>But leaving the other parts of the butterfly, let us turn our
attention particularly to the head. The eyes of butterflies have not all the
same <PB N="36" REF="36"/> form; for, in some they are large, in others
small; in some they are the larger portion of a sphere, in others they
are but a small part of it, and just appearing from the head. In all of
them, however, the outward coat has a lustre, in which may be discovered
the various colours of the rainbow. When examined a little closely, it will
be found to have the ap∣pearance of a multiplying glass; having a great
number of sides, or facets, in the man∣ner of a brilliant cut diamond. In
this par∣ticular, the eye of the butterfly, and of most other insects,
entirely correspond; and Luen∣hoek pretends, there are above six thousand
facets on the cornea of a flea. These animals, therefore, see not only with
great clearness; but view every object multiplied in a surprizing manner.
Puget adapted the cornea of a fly in such a position, as to see objects
through it by the means of a microscope; and nothing could exceed the
strangeness of its representations: a soldier, who was seen through
it, appeared like an army of pigmies; for while it multi∣plied, it also
diminished the object: the arch of a bridge exhibited a spectacle more
magni∣ficent than human skill could perform; the flame of a candle seemed a
beautiful illumi∣nation. It still, however, remains a doubt, 
<PB N="37" REF="37"/> whether the insect sees objects singly, as with one
eye; or whether every facet is itself a com∣plete eye, exhibiting its own
object distinct from all the rest.</P>
<P>Butterflies, as well as most other flying insects, have two
instruments, like horns, on their heads, which are commonly called feelers.
They dif∣fer from the horns of greater animals, in being moveable at their
base; and in having a great number of joints, by which means the insect is
enabled to turn them in every direction. Those of butterflies are placed at
the top of the head, pretty near the external edge of each eye. What the use
of these instruments may be, which are thus formed with so much art, and
by a Work∣man who does nothing without reason, is as yet unknown to man. They
may serve to guard the eye; they may be of use to clean it; or they may be
the organ of some sense which we are ignorant of: but this is only
explaining one difficulty by another.</P>
<P>We are not so ignorant of the uses of the trunk, which few
insects of the butterfly kind are without. This instrument is placed
exactly between the eyes; and when the animal is not employed in seeking its
nourishment, it is rolled up, like a curl. A butterfly, when it is feeding,
flies round some flower, and settles upon it. <PB N="38" REF="38"/> The
trunk is then uncurled, and thrust out either wholly or in part; and is
employed in searching the flower to its very bottom, let it be never so
deep. This search being repeated seven or eight times, the butterfly then
passes to another; and continues to hover over those agreeable to its
taste, like a bird over its prey. This trunk consists of two equal hollow
tubes, nicely joined to each other, like the pipes of an organ.</P>
<P>Such is the figure and conformation of these beautiful
insects, that cheer our walks, and give us the earliest intimations of
summer. But it is not by day alone that they are seen fluttering wantonly
from flower to flower, as the greatest number of them fly by night, and
ex∣pand the most beautiful colouring, at those hours when there is no
spectator. This tribe of insects has therefore been divided into Di∣urnal
and Nocturnal Flies; or, more properly speaking, into Butterflies and Moths:
the one only flying by day, the other most usually on the wing in the
night. They may be easily distinguished from each other, by their horns
or feelers: those of the butterfly being clubbed, or knobbed at the end;
those of the moth, tapering finer and finer to a point. To express it
technically—the feelers of butterflies are cla∣vated; those of moths,
are filiform.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="39"/>The butterflies, as well as the moths,
employ the short life assigned them, in a variety of en∣joyments. Their
whole time is spent either in quest of food, which every flower offers; or
in pursuit of the female, whose approach they can often perceive at above
two miles distance. Their sagacity in this particular is not less
asto∣nishing than true; but by what sense they are thus capable of
distinguishing each other at such distances, is not easy to conceive.
It cannot be by the sight, since such small objects as they are must
be utterly imperceptible, at half the distance at which they perceive each
other: it can scarcely be by the sense of smelling, since the animal
has no organs for that purpose. Whatever be their powers of perception,
certain it is, that the male, after having fluttered, as if carelesly, about
for some time, is seen to take wing, and go forward, sometimes for two
miles together, in a direct line to where the female is perched on a
flower.</P>
<P>The general rule among insects is, that the female is larger
than the male; and this obtains particularly in the tribe I am describing.
The body of the male is smaller and slenderer; that of the female, more
thick and oval. Previous to the junction of these animals, they are seen
sporting in the air, pursuing and flying from <PB N="40" REF="40"/> each
other, and preparing, by a mock combat, for the more important business of
their lives. If they be disturbed while united, the female flies off with the
male on her back, who seems entirely passive upon the occasion.</P>
<P>But the females of many moths and butterflies seem to have
assumed their airy form for no other reason but to fecundate their eggs,
and lay them. They are not seen fluttering about in quest of food, or a
mate: all that passes, during their short lives, is a junction with the
male of about half an hour; after which they deposite their eggs, and die,
without taking any nourishment, or seeking any. It may be ob∣served,
however, that in all the females of this tribe, they are impregnated by the
male by one aperture, and lay their eggs by another.</P>
<P>The eggs of female butterflies are disposed in the body like
a bed of chaplets; which, when excluded, are usually oval, and of a whitish
colour: some, however, are quite round; and others flatted, like a turnip.
The covering or shell of the egg, though solid, is thin and trans∣parent;
and in proportion as the caterpillar grows within the egg, the colours change,
and are distributed differently. The butterfly seems very well instructed
by nature in its choice of the plant, or the leaf, where it shall deposite
its <PB N="41" REF="41"/> burthen. Each egg contains but one caterpillar; and it
is requisite that this little animal, when excluded, should be near its
peculiar provision. The butterfly, therefore, is careful to place her brood
only upon those plants that afford good nourishment to its posterity.
Though the little winged animal has been fed itself upon dew, or the honey of
flowers, yet it makes choice for its young of a very different provision, and
lays its eggs on the most unsavoury plants; the rag∣weed, the cabbage, or
the nettle. Thus every butterfly chuses not the plant most grateful to it
in its winged state; but such as it has fed upon in its reptile form.</P>
<P>All the eggs of butterflies are attached to the leaves of the
favourite plant, by a sort of size or glue; where they continue,
unobserved, unless carefully sought after. The eggs are sometimes
placed round the tender shoots of plants, in the form of bracelets,
consisting of above two hundred in each, and generally surrounding the
shoot, like a ring upon a finger. Some butterflies secure their eggs from
the injuries of air, by covering them with hair, plucked from their own bodies,
as birds sometimes are seen to make their nests; so that their eggs are
thus kept warm, and also entirely concealed.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42"/>All the tribe of female moths lay their eggs
a short time after they leave the aurelia; but there are many butterflies
that flutter about the whole summer, and do not think of laying, till the
winter begins to warn them of their ap∣proaching end: some even continue the
whole winter in the hollows of trees, and do not pro∣vide for posterity until
the beginning of April, when they leave their retreats, deposite their eggs,
and die. Their eggs soon begin to feel the genial influence of the
season: the little animals burst from them in their caterpillar state,
to become aurelias, and butterflies in their turn; and thus to continue the
round of nature.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Enemies of the Caterpillar.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE, though it has rendered some animals surprizingly
fruitful, yet ever takes care to prevent their too great encrease. One set
of creatures is generally opposed to another: and those are chiefly the
most prolific, that are, from their imbecility, incapable of making any
effectual defence. The caterpillar has perhaps, of all other animals, the
greatest number of enemies; and seems only to exist, by its sur∣prizing
fecundity. Some animals devour them by hundreds; others, more minute, yet more
dangerous, mangle them in various ways: so that, how great soever their
numbers may be, their destroyers are in equal proportion. In∣deed, if we
consider the mischiefs these reptiles are capable of occasioning, and
the various da∣mages we sustain from their insatiable rapacity, it is
happy for the other ranks of nature, that there are thousands of fishes,
birds, and even insects, that live chiefly upon caterpillars, and make them
their most favourite repast.</P>
<P>When we described the little birds that live in our gardens,
and near our houses, as de∣structive <PB N="44" REF="44"/> neighbours,
sufficient attention was not paid to the services which they are
fre∣quently found to render us. It has been proved, that a single sparrow
and its mate, that have young ones, destroy above three thousand
ca∣terpillars in a week; not to mention several butterflies, in which
numberless caterpillars are destroyed in embryo. It is in pursuit of
these reptiles that we are favoured with the visits of many of our most
beautiful songsters; that amuse us during their continuance, and leave us
when the caterpillars disappear.</P>
<P>The maxim which has often been urged against man, that he, of
all other animals, is the only creature that is an enemy to his own kind, and
that the human species only are found to destroy each other, has been
adopted, by persons who never considered the history of insects. Some
of the caterpillar kind in par∣ticular, that seem fitted only to live upon
leaves and plants, will, however, eat each other; and the strongest will
devour the weak, in pre∣ference to their vegetable food. That which lives upon
the oak, is found to seize any of its companions, which it conveniently can,
by the first rings, and inflict a deadly wound: it then feasts in
tranquillity on its prey, and leaves no∣thing of the animal but the husk.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45"/>But it is not from each other they have
most to fear, as in general they are inoffensive; and many of this tribe
are found to live in a kind of society. Many kinds of flies lay their eggs
either upon, or within their bodies; and as these turn into worms, the
caterpillar is seen to nourish a set of intestine enemies within its
body, that must shortly be its destruction: Nature having taught flies,
as well as all other animals, the surest methods of perpetuating their
kind. 
<Q REND="inline">"Towards the end of August," says Reaumur,
"I perceived a little fly, of a beautiful gold colour, busily employed in the
body of a large caterpillar, of that kind which feeds upon cabbage. I gently
separated that part of the leaf on which these insects were placed, from
the rest of the plant, and placed it where I might observe them more at my
ease. The fly, wholly taken up by the business in which it was employed,
walked along the cater∣pillar's body, now and then remaining fixed to a
particular spot. Upon this occasion, I perceived it every now and then dart
a sting, which it carried at the end of its tail, into the caterpillar's
body, and then drew it out again, to repeat the same operation in another
place. It was not difficult for me to conjecture the business which engaged
this animal so ear∣nestly; <PB N="46" REF="46"/> its whole aim was to
deposite its eggs in the caterpillar's body; which was to serve as a proper
retreat for bringing them to per∣fection. The reptile thus rudely treated,
seemed to bear all very patiently, only mov∣ing a little when stung too
deeply; which, however, the fly seemed entirely to disregard. I took
particular care to feed this caterpillar; which seemed to me to continue as
voracious and vigorous as any of the rest of its kind. In about ten or twelve
days, it changed into an aurelia, which seemed gradually to decline, and
died: upon examining its internal parts, the animal was entirely devoured by
worms; which, however, did not come to perfection, as it is probable they had
not enough to sustain them within."</Q></P>
<P>What the French philosopher perceived upon this occasion, is
every day to be seen in several of the larger kinds of caterpillars,
whose bodies serve as a nest to various flies, that very carefully
deposite their eggs within them. The large cabbage caterpillar is so
subject to its injuries, that, at certain seasons, it is much easier to
find them with than without them. The ichnumon fly, as it is called,
particularly infests these rep∣tiles, and prevents their fecundity. This
fly is, of all others, the most formidable to insects of 
<PB N="47" REF="47"/> various kinds. The spider, that destroys the ant, the
moth, and the butterfly, yet often falls a prey to the ichnumon; who pursues
the robber to his retreat, and, despising his nets, tears him in pieces, in
the very labyrinth he has made. This insect, as redoubtable as the little
quadru∣pede that destroys the crocodile, has received the same name; and
from its destruction of the caterpillar tribe, is probably more serviceable
to mankind. This insect, I say, makes the body of the caterpillar the place
for depositing its eggs; to the number of ten, fifteen, or twenty. As they
are laid in those parts which are not mortal, the reptile still continues
to live, and to feed, shewing no signs of being incommoded by its new
guests. The caterpillar changes its skin; and sometimes undergoes the
great change into an aurelia: but still the fatal intruders work within, and
secretly devour its internal sub∣stance: soon after they are seen
bursting through its skin, and moving away, in order to spin
them∣selves a covering, previous to their own little transformation. It is
indeed astonishing some∣times to see the number of worms, and those
pretty large, that thus issue from the body of a single caterpillar, and
eat their way through its skin: but it is more extraordinary still, that
they should remain within the body, devouring its <PB N="48" REF="48"/>
entrails, without destroying its life. The truth is, they seem instructed
by nature not to devour its vital parts; for they are found to feed only upon
that fatty substance which composes the largest part of the
caterpillar's body. When this surprizing appearance was first observed,
it was supposed that the animal thus gave birth to a number of flies,
different from itself; and that the same caterpillar sometimes bred an
ichnumon, and sometimes a butterfly: but it was not till after more careful
inspection, it was discovered, that the ichnumon tribe were not the
caterpillar's offspring, but its murderers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Silkworm.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING mentioned, in the last chapter, the damages inflicted
by the caterpillar tribe, we now come to an animal of this kind, that alone
compensates for all the mischief occasioned by the rest. This little
creature, which only works for itself, has been made of the utmost
service to man; and furnishes him with a covering more beautiful than any
other animal can supply. We may declaim indeed against the luxuries of the
times, when silk is so generally worn; but were such garments to fail,
what other arts could supply their deficiency?</P>
<P>Though silk was anciently brought in small quantities to
Rome, yet it was so scarce as to be sold for its weight in gold; and was
considered as such a luxurious refinement in dress, that it was infamous
for a man to appear in habits of which silk formed but half the
composition. It was most probably brought among them from the remotest
parts of the east; since it was, at the time of which I am speaking,
scarcely known even in Persia.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more remote from the truth, <PB N="50" REF="50"/>
than the manner in which their historians describe the animal by which
silk is produced. Pausanias informs us, that silk came from the country
of the Seres, a people of Asiatic Scy∣thia; in which place an insect, as
large as the beetle, but in every other respect resembling a spider, was
bred up for that purpose. They take great care, as he assures us, to feed
and defend it from the weather; as well during the summer's heat, as the
rigours of winter. This insect, he observes, makes its web with its feet,
of which it has eight in number. It is fed, for the space of four years, upon
a kind of paste, prepared for it; and at the beginning of the fifth, it is
supplied with the leaves of the green willow, of which it is particularly
fond. It then feeds till it bursts with fat; after which they take out its
bowels, which are spun into the beautiful manufacture so scarce and
costly.</P>
<P>The real history of this animal was unknown among the Romans
till the times of Justinian; and it is supposed, that silkworms were
not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century; when Roger
of Sicily, brought workmen in this manufacture from Asia Minor, after his
return from his expedition to the Holy Land, and settled them in Sicily and
Calabria. From these the other kingdoms of Europe <PB N="51" REF="51"/>
learned this manufacture; and it is now one of the most lucrative carried on
among the southern provinces of Europe.</P>
<P>The silkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar,
of a whitish colour, with twelve feet, and producing a butterfly of the moth
kind. The cone on which it spins, is formed for covering it while it
continues in the aurelia state; and several of these, properly wound off,
and united together, form those strong and beautiful threads, which is
woven into silk. The feeding these worms, the gathering, the winding, the
twisting, and the weaving their silk, is one of the principal manufactures
of Europe; and, as our luxuries encrease, seems every day to become more
and more necessary to human happiness.</P>
<P>There are two methods of breeding silk∣worms; for they may be
left to grow, and re∣main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched; or
they may be kept in a place built for that purpose, and fed every day with
fresh leaves. The first method is used in China, Tonquin, and other hot
countries; the other is used in those places where the animal has been
artificially propagated, and still continues a stranger. In the warm
climates, the silkworm proceeds from an egg, which has been glued 
<PB N="52" REF="52"/> by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberry-tree,
and which remains in that situa∣tion during the winter. The manner in which
they are situated and fixed to the tree, keeps them unaffected by the
influence of the wea∣ther; so that those frosts which are severe enough
to kill the tree, have no power to injure the silkworm.</P>
<P>The insect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has
provided it a sufficient supply; and till the budding leaves are
furnished, in suffi∣cient abundance, for its support. When the leaves are
put forth, the worms seem to feel the genial summons, and bursting from
their little eggs, crawl upon the leaves, where they feed with a most
voracious appetite. Thus they become larger by degrees; and after some months
feeding, they lay, upon every leaf, small bundles, or cones of silk, which
appear like so many golden apples, painted on a fine green ground. Such is
the method of breeding them in the East; and without doubt it is best for
the worms, and least troublesome for the feeder of them. But it is
otherwise in our colder European climates; the frequent changes of the
weather, and the heavy dews of our even∣ings, render the keeping them all night
exposed, subject to so many inconveniences, as to admit 
<PB N="53" REF="53"/> of no remedy, It is true, that by the assistance of
nets, they may be preserved from the insults of birds; but the severe
cold weather, which often succeeds the first heats of summer, as well as
the rain and high winds, will destroy them all: and, therefore, to breed them
in Europe, they must be sheltered and protected from every external
injury.</P>
<P>For this purpose, a room is chosen, with a south aspect;
and the windows are so well glazed, as not to admit the least air: the
walls are well built, and the planks of the floor ex∣ceeding close, so as
to admit neither birds nor mice, nor even so much as an insect. In the
middle there should be four pillars erected, or four wooden posts, so
placed as to form a pretty large square. Between these are different
stories made with ozier hurdles; and under each hur∣dle there should be a
floor, with an upright bor∣der all round. These hurdles and floors must
hang upon pullies, so as to be placed, or taken down at pleasure.</P>
<P>When the worms are hatched, some tender mulberry leaves are
provided, and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were laid, and
which are large enough to hold a great number. When they have acquired some
strength, they must be distributed on beds of <PB N="54" REF="54"/>
mulberry leaves, in the different stories of the square in the middle of
the room, round which a person may freely pass on every side. They will
fix themselves to the leaves, and afterwards to the sticks of the hurdles,
when the leaves are devoured. They have then a thread, by which they can
suspend themselves on occasion, to pre∣vent any shock by a fall; but
this is by no means to be considered as the silk which they spin
afterwards in such abundance. Care must be taken that fresh leaves be
brought every morning, which must be strewed very gently and equally over
them; upon which the silk∣worms will forsake the remainder of the old
leaves, which must be carefully taken away, and every thing kept very clean;
for nothing hurts these insects so much as moisture and
unclean∣liness. For this reason their leaves must be gathered when the
weather is dry, and kept in a dry place, if it be necessary to lay in a
store. As these animals have but a short time to live, they make use of
every moment, and almost continually are spinning, except at those
in∣tervals when they change their skins. If mul∣berry leaves be difficult to
be obtained, the leaves of lettuce or holyoak will sustain them: but they
do not thrive so well upon their new diet; and their silk will neither be
so copious, nor of so good a quality.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="55"/>Though the judicious choice, and careful
management of their diet, is absolutely ne∣cessary, yet there is another
precaution of equal importance, which is to give them air, and open their
chamber windows, at such times as the sun shines warmest. The place
also must be kept as clean as possible; not only the several floors
that are laid to receive their ordure, but the whole apartments in general.
These things well observed, contribute greatly to their health and
encrease.</P>
<P>The worm, at the the time it bursts the shell, is extremely
small, and of a black colour; but the head is of a more shining black than
the rest of the body: some days after, they begin to turn whitish, or of
an ash-coloured grey. After the skin begins to grow too rigid, or he animal
is stinted within it, the insect throws it off, and appears cloathed a-new:
it then be∣comes larger and much whiter, though it has a greenish cast:
after some days, which are more or less, according to the different heat of
the climate, or to the quality of the food, it leaves off eating, and seems
to sleep for two days together: then it begins to stir, and put itself
into violent motions, till the skin falls off the second time, and is
thrown aside by the animal's feet. All these changes are made in three
weeks <PB N="58" REF="56"/> may easily be observed is, that it is composed
externally of a kind of rough cotton-like sub∣stance, which is called
floss; within the thread is more distinct and even; and next the body of
the aurelia, the apartment seems lined with a substance of the hardness
of paper, but of a much stronger consistence. It must not be
sup∣posed, that the thread which goes to compose the cone, is rolled
round, as we roll a bottom; on the contrary, it lies upon it in a very
irre∣gular manner, and winds off now from one side of the cone, and then from
the other. This whole thread, if measured, will be found about three hundred
yards long; and so very fine, that eight or ten of them are generally rolled
off into one by the manufacturers. The cone, when completed, is in form like a
pidgeon's egg, and more pointed at one end than the other; at the smaller
end, the head of the aurelia is generally found; and this is the place that the
insect, when converted into a moth, is generally seen to burst
through.</P>
<P>It is generally a fortnight or three weeks before the aurelia is
changed into a moth; but no sooner is the winged insect completely formed,
than having divested itself of its aurelia skin, it prepares to burst
through its cone, or outward prison: for this purpose it extends its 
<PB N="59" REF="57"/> head towards the point of the cone, butts with its eyes,
which are rough, against the lining of its cell, wears it away, and at last
pushes for∣ward, through a passage which is small at first, but which
enlarges as the animal encreases its efforts for emancipation; while the
tattered rem∣nants of its aurelia skin lie in confusion within the cone,
like a bundle of dirty linen.</P>
<P>The animal, when thus set free from its double confinement,
appears exhausted with fatigue, and seems produced for no other pur∣pose
but to transmit a future brood. It neither flies nor eats; the male only
seeking the female, whose eggs he impregnates; and their union continues
for four days, without interruption. The male dies immediately after
separation from his mate; and she survives him only till she has laid
her eggs, which are not hatched into worms till the ensuing spring.</P>
<P>However, there are few of these animals suf∣fered to come to
a state of maturity; for as their bursting through the cone destroys the
silk, the manufacturers take care to kill the aurelia, by exposing it to
the sun, before the moth comes to perfection. This done, they take off the
floss, and throw the cones into warm water, stirring them till the first
thread offers them a clue for winding all off. They generally take eight of 
<PB N="60" REF="58"/> the silken threads together; the cones still kept
under water, till a proper quantity of the silk is wound off: however, they
do not take all; for the latter parts grow weak, and are of a bad colour. As to
the paper-like substance which remains, some stain it with a variety of
colours, to make artificial flowers; others let it lie in the water, till the
glutinous matter which cements it is all dissolved: it is then carded like
wool, spun with a wheel, and converted into silk stuffs of an inferior
kind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Fourth Order of Insects.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing part we treated of cater∣pillars changing into
butterflies; in the present will be given the history of grubs changing
into their corresponding winged animals. These, like the former, undergo
their transformation, and appear as grubs or maggots, as aurelias, and at
last as winged insects. Like the former, they are bred from eggs; they feed
in their reptile state; they continue motionless and lifeless, as
aurelias; and fly and propagate, when furnished with wings. But they differ
in many respects: the grub or maggot wants the number of feet which the
caterpillar is seen to have; the aurelia is not so totally wrapped up, but
that its feet and its wings appear. The perfect animal, when emancipated,
also has its wings either cased, or transparent, like gauze; not coloured
with that beautifully painted dust which adorns the wings of the
butterfly.</P>
<P>In this class of insects, therefore, we may place a various
tribe, that are first laid as eggs, then are excluded as maggots or grubs,
then change <PB N="64" REF="61"/> into aurelias, with their legs and wings not
wrapped up, but appearing; and lastly, assum∣ing wings, in which state
they propagate their kind. Some of these have four transparent wings, as
bees; some have two membranous cases to their wings, as beetles; and some
have but two wings, which are transparent, as ants. Here, therefore, we will
place the bee, the wasp, the humble bee, the ichnumon fly, the gnat, the
tipula or longlegs, the bettle, the may-bug, the glow-worm, and the ant. The
transformations which all these undergo, are pretty nearly similar; and
though very different animals in form, are yet produced nearly in the same
manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Bee.</HEAD>
<P>TO give a complete history of this insect in a few pages,
which some have exhausted vo∣lumes in describing, and whose nature and
pro∣perties still continue in dispute, is impossible. It will be
sufficient to give a general idea of the animal's operations; which, though
they have been studied for more than two thousand years, are still but
incompletely known. The account given us by Reaumur is sufficiently minute;
and, if true, sufficiently wonderful: but I find many of the facts which he
relates, doubted by those who are most conversant with bees; and some
of them actually declared not to have a real existence in nature.</P>
<P>It is unhappy, therefore, for those whose me∣thod demands an
history of bees, that they are unfurnished with those materials which
have in∣duced so many observers to contradict so great a naturalist.
His life was spent in the contem∣plation; and it requires an equal share of
at∣tention, to prove the error of his discoveries. Without entering,
therefore, into the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pute, I will
take him for my guide; and just mention, <PB N="66" REF="63"/> as I go along,
those particulars in which suc∣ceeding observers have begun to think him
er∣roneous. Which of the two are right, time only can discover; for my part I
have only heard one side, for as yet none have been so bold as openly to
oppose Reaumur's delightful researches.</P>
<P>There are three different kinds of bees in every hive. First,
the labouring bees, which make up the far greatest number, and are thought to
be neither male or female, but merely born for the purposes of labour, and
continuing the breed, by supplying the young with provision, while yet in
their helpless state. The second sort are the drones; they are of a
darker colour, longer, and more thick by one third than the former: they are
supposed to be the males; and there is not above a hundred of them, in a
hive of seven or eight thousand bees. The third sort is much larger than
either of the former, and still fewer in number: some assert, that
there is not above one in every swarm; but this later observers affirm not
to be true, there being sometimes five or six in the same hive. These
are called queen bees, and are said to lay all the eggs from which the whole
swarm is hatched in a season.</P>
<P>In examining the structure of the common working bee, the
first remarkable part that <PB N="67" REF="64"/> offers is the trunk, which
serves to extract the honey from flowers. It is not formed, like that of
other flies, in the manner of a tube, by which the fluid is to be sucked up;
but like a besom, to sweep, or a tongue, to lick it away. The animal is
furnished also with teeth, which serve it in making wax. This
substance is gathered from flowers, like honey; it consists of that
dust or farina which contribute to the fecundation of plants, and is molded
into wax by the little animal, at leisure. Every bee, when it leaves the hive
to collect this precious store, enters into the cup of the flower,
particularly such as seem charged with the greatest quantities of this
yellow farina. As the animal's body is covered over with hair, it rolls
itself within the flower, and soon becomes quite covered with the dust,
which it soon after brushes off with its two hind legs, and kneads into two
little balls. In the thighs of the hind legs there are two cavities, edged with
hair; and into these, as into a basket, the animal sticks its pellets.
Thus employed, the bee flies from flower to flower, encreasing its store,
and adding to its stock of wax; until the ball, upon each thigh, becomes as
big as a grain of pepper: by this time, having got a sufficient load, it
returns, making the best of its way to the hive.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="65"/>The belly of the bee is divided into six
rings, which sometime shorten the body, by slipping one over the other.
It contains within it, beside the intestines, the honey-bag, the venom-bag,
and the sting. The honey-bag is as transparent as chrystal, containing
the honey that the bee has brushed from the flowers; of which the greater
part is carried to the hive, and poured into the cells of the honey-comb; while
the re∣mainder serves for the bee's own nourishment: for, during summer,
it never touches what has been laid up for the winter. The sting, which
serves to defend this little animal from its enemies, is composed of three
parts; the sheath, and two darts, which are extremely small and
penetrating. Both the darts have several small points or barbs, like
those of a fish-hook, which renders the sting more painful, and makes the
darts rankle in the wound. Still, however, this instrument would be very
slight, did not the bee poison the wound. The sheath, which has a sharp
point, makes the first impression; which is followed by that of the
darts, and then the venomous liquor is poured in. The sheath sometimes
sticks so fast in the wound, that the animal is obliged to leave it
behind; by which the bee soon after dies, and the wound is con∣siderably
enflamed. It might at first appear <PB N="69" REF="66"/> well for mankind, if
the bee were without its sting; but, upon recollection, it will be found,
that the little animal would then have too many rivals in sharing its
labours. An hundred other lazy animals, fond of honey, and hating la∣bour,
would intrude upon the sweets of the hive; and the treasure would be
carried off, for want of armed guardians to protect it.</P>
<P>From examining the bee singly, we now come to consider it in
society, as an animal not only subject to laws, but active, vigilant,
laborious, and disinterested. All its provisions are laid up for the
community; and all its arts in building a cell, designed for the benefit of
posterity. The substance with which bees build their cells is wax; which
is fashioned into convenient apart∣ments for themselves and their young.
When they begin to work in their hives, they divide themselves into four
companies: one of which roves in the fields in search of materials; another
employs itself in laying out the bottom and par∣titions of their cells; a
third is employed in making the inside smooth from the corners and angles;
and the fourth company bring food for the rest, or relieve those who return
with their respective burthens. But they are not kept constant to one
employment; they often change the tasks assigned them: those that have
been <PB N="70" REF="67"/> at work, being permitted to go abroad; and those
that have been in the fields already, take their places. They seem even to
have signs, by which they understand each other; for when any of them want
food, it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected, which then
opens its honey-bag, and lets some drops fall into the other's mouth, which
is at that time opened to receive it. Their diligence and labour is so great,
that, in a day's time, they are able to make cells, which lie upon each other
numerous enough to contain three thousand bees.</P>
<P>If we examine their cells, they will be found formed in the
exactest proportion. It was said by Pappus, an ancient geometrician, that,
of all other figures, hexagons were the most con∣venient; for, when placed
touching each other, the most convenient room would be given, and the
smallest lost. The cells of the bees are per∣fect hexagons: these, in
every honeycomb, are double, opening on either side, and closed at the
bottom. The bottoms are composed of little triangular panes, which, when
united together, terminate in a point, and lie exactly upon the extremities of
other panes of the same shape, in opposite cells. These lodgings have
spaces, like streets, between them, large enough to give the 
<PB N="71" REF="68"/> bees a free passage in and out; and yet narrow enough
to preserve the necessary heat. The mouth of every cell is defended by a
border, which makes the door a little less than the inside of the cell,
which serves to strengthen the whole. These cells serve for different
pur∣poses: for laying up their young; for their wax, which in winter becomes
a part of their food; and for their honey, which makes their principal
subsistence.</P>
<P>It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very
close; and what their hives want, from the negligence or unskilfulness of
man, these animals supply by their own industry: so that it is their
principal care, when first hived, to stop up all the crannies. For this
purpose they make use of a resinous gum, which is more tenacious than
wax, and differs greatly from it. This the ancients called Propolis: it will
grow considerably hard in June; though it will in some measure soften
by heat; and is often found different in consistence, colour and smell.
It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed; and by some
it is considered as a most grateful perfume. When the bees begin to work
with it, it is soft, but it acquires a firmer consistence every day; till
at length it assumes a brown colour, and becomes much <PB N="72" REF="69"/>
harder than wax. The bees carry it on their hinder legs; and some think it is
met with on the birch, the willow, and poplar. However it is procured, it is
certain that they plaister the inside of their hives with this
composition.</P>
<P>If examined through a glass hive, from the hurry the whole
swarm is in, the whole at first appears like anarchy and confusion: but
the spectator soon finds every animal diligently em∣ployed, and following
one pursuit, with a set∣tled purpose. Their teeth are the instruments
by which they model and fashion their various buildings, and give them such
symmetry and perfection. They begin at the top of the hive; and several of
them work at a time, at the cells which have two faces. If they are stinted
with regard to time, they give the new cells but half the depth which they
ought to have; leaving them imperfect, till they have sketched out the number
of cells necessary for the present occasion. The construction of
their combs, costs them a great deal of labour: they are made by
insen∣sible additions; and not cast at once in a mold, as some are apt
to imagine. There seems no end of their shaping, finishing, and turning
them neatly up. The cells for their young are most carefully formed; those
designed for lodging the drones, are larger than the rest; 
<PB N="73" REF="70"/> and that for the queen-bee, the largest of all. The
cells in which the young brood are lodged, serve at different times for
containing honey; and this proceeds from an obvious cause: every worm, before
it is transformed into an aurelia, hangs its old skin on the partitions of
its cell; and thus, while it strengthens the wall, dimi∣nishes the capacity
of its late apartment. The same cell, in a single summer, is often
tenanted by three or four worms in succession; and the next season,
by three or four more. Each worm takes particular care to fortify the pannels
of its cell, by hanging up its spoils there: thus, the partitions being
lined, six or eight deep, become at last too narrow for a new brood, and
are converted into store-houses, for honey.</P>
<P>Those cells where nothing but honey is de∣posited, are much
deeper than the rest. When the harvest of honey is so plentiful that they
have not sufficient room for it, they either lengthen their combs, or build
more; which are much longer than the former. Sometimes they work at three combs
at a time; for, when there are three work-houses, more bees may be thus
employed, without embarrassing each other.</P>
<P>But honey, as was before observed, is not the only food upon
which these animals subsist. <PB N="74" REF="71"/> The meal of flowers,
of which their wax is formed, is one of their most favourite repasts. This
is a diet which they live upon during the summer; and of which they lay up a
large winter provision. The wax of which their combs are made, is no more
than this meal digested, and wrought into a paste. When the flowers upon
which bees generally feed, are not fully blown, and this meal or dust is not
offered in sufficient quantities, the bees pinch the tops of the stamina in
which it is contained, with their teeth; and thus anticipate the progress of
vegetation. In April and May, the bees are busy, from morning to evening, in
gathering this meal; but when the weather becomes too hot in the midst of
summer, they work only in the morning.</P>
<P>The bee is furnished with a stomach for its wax, as well as
its honey. In the former of the two, their powder is altered, digested and
concocted into real wax; and is thus ejected by the same passage by which
it was swallowed. Every comb, newly made, is white: but it be∣comes yellow as
it grows old, and almost black when kept too long in the hive. Beside the
wax thus digested, there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food
in every hive, and kept in separate cells, for winter provision. 
<PB N="75" REF="72"/> This is called, by the country people, bee-bread; and
contributes to the health and strength of the animal during winter. Those
who rear bees, may rob them of their honey, and feed them, during the winter,
with treacle; but no proper substitute has yet been found for the
bee-bread; and, without it, the animals become consumptive and die.</P>
<P>As for the honey, it is extracted from that part of the flower
called the nectareum. From the mouth this delicious fluid passes into the
gullet; and then into the first stomach, or honey-bag, which, when filled,
appears like an oblong bladder. Children, that live in country places, are well
acquainted with this bladder; and destroy many bees to come at their store
of honey. When a bee has sufficiently filled its first stomach, it
returns back to the hive, where it disgorges the honey into one of the cells.
It often happens that the bee delivers its store to some other, at the
mouth of the hive, and flies off for a fresh supply. Some honey-combs are
always left open for common use; but many others are stopped up, till there
is a necessity of opening them. Each of these are covered care∣fully with
wax; so close, that the covers seem to be made at the very instant the
fluid is de∣posited within them.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="73"/>Having thus given a cursory description
of the insect, individually considered, and of the habitation it forms, we
next come to its social habits and institutions: and, in considering this
little animal attentively, after the necessary pre∣cautions for the
immediate preservation of the community, its second care is turned to the
continuance of posterity. How numerous soever the multitude of bees may
appear in one swarm, yet they all owe their original to a single parent,
which is called the queen-bee. It is indeed surprizing that a single
insect shall, in one summer, give birth to above twenty thousand young:
but, upon opening her body, the wonder will cease; as the number of eggs
appearing, at one time, amounts to five thousand. This animal, whose
existence is of such importance to her subjects, may easily be
distinguished from the rest, by her size, and the shape of her body.
On her safety depends the whole wel∣fare of the commonwealth; and the
attentions paid her by all the rest of the swarm, evidently shew the
dependence her subjects have upon her security. If this insect be
carefully observed, she will be seen at times attended with a nu∣merous
retinue, marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremity of her body into
many of them, and leaving a small egg in each.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="74"/>The bees which generally compose her
train, are thought to be males, which serve to im∣pregnate her by turns.
These are larger and blacker than the common bees; without stings, and
without industry. They seem formed only to transmit a posterity; and to
attend the queen, whenever she thinks proper to issue from the secret
retreats of the hive, where she most usually resides. Upon the union of
these two kinds depends all expectations of a future pro∣geny; for the
working bees are of no sex, and only labour for another offspring: yet such
is their attention to their queen, that if she hap∣pens to die, they will
leave off working, and take no farther care of posterity. If, however,
another queen is in this state of universal despair presented them,
they immediately acknowledge her for sovereign, and once more diligently
ap∣ply to their labour. It must be observed, how∣ever, that all this
fertility of the queen-bee, and the great attentions paid to her by the rest,
are controverted by more recent observers. They assert, that the common
bees are parents themselves; that they deposite their eggs in the cells
which they have prepared; that the females are impregnated by the males, and
bring forth a progeny, which is wholly their own.</P>
<P>However, to go on with their history, as <PB N="78" REF="75"/>
delivered us by Mr. Reaumur—When the queen-bee has deposited the number
of eggs necessary in the cells, the working bees under∣take the care of the
rising posterity. They are seen to leave off their usual employments;
to construct proper receptacles for eggs; or to complete those that are
already formed. They purposely build little cells, extremely solid, for the
young; in which they employ a great deal of wax: those designed for lodging
the males, as was already observed, are larger than the rest; and those
for the queen-bees the largest of all. There is usually but one egg
deposited in every cell; but when the fecundity of the queen is such, that
it exceeds the number of cells already pre∣pared, there are sometimes three
or four eggs crowded together in the same apartment. But this is an
inconvenience that the working bees will by no means suffer. They seem
sensible that, two young ones, stuffed up in the same cell, when they
grow larger, will but embarrass, and at last destroy each other: they
therefore take care to leave a cell to every egg; and remove, or destroy the
rest.</P>
<P>The single egg that is left remaining, is fixed to the bottom
of the cell, and touches it but in a single point. A day or two after it is
depo∣sited, the worm is excluded from the shell of <PB N="79" REF="76"/> the
egg, having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and lying softly
on a bed of a whitish coloured jelly; upon which also the little animal
begins to feed. In the mean time, the instant it appears, the working bees
attend it with the most anxious and parental tenderness; they furnish it
every hour with a supply of this whitish substance, on which it feeds
and lies; and watch the cell with unre∣mitting care. They are nurses that
have a greater affection for the offspring of others, than many parents have
for their own children. They are constant in visiting each cell, and
seeing that nothing is wanting; preparing the white mixture, which is nothing
but a compo∣sition of honey and wax, in their own bowels, with which they
feed them. Thus attended, and plentifully fed, the worm, in less than six
days time, comes to its full growth, and no longer accepts the food offered it.
When the bees perceive that it has no further occasion for feeding, they
perform the last offices of ten∣derness, and shut the little animal up in
its cell; walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax: there they leave the
worm to itself; having secured it from every external injury.</P>
<P>The worm is no sooner left enclosed, but, from a state of
inaction, it begins to labour, <PB N="80" REF="77"/> extending and shortening
its body; and by this means lining the walls of its apartment with a silken
tapestry, which it spins in the manner of caterpillars, before they undergo
their last transformation. When their cell is thus pre∣pared, the animal is
soon after transformed into an aurelia; but differing from that of the
com∣mon caterpillar, as it exhibits not only the legs, but the wings of the
future bee, in its present state of inactivity. Thus, in about twenty, or
one and twenty days after the egg was laid, the bee is completely formed, and
fitted to undergo the fatigues of its state. When all its parts have acquired
their proper strength and con∣sistence, the young animal opens its
prison, by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that con∣fines it. When
just freed from its cell, it is as yet moist, and incommoded with the
spoils of its former situation; but the officious bees are soon seen to
flock round it, and to lick it clean on all sides with their trunks; while
another band, with equal assiduity, are observed to feed it with honey:
others again begin immediately to cleanse the cell that has been just left;
to carry the or∣dures out of the hive, and to fit the place for a new
inhabitant. The young bee soon repays their care, by its industry; for as
soon as ever its external parts become dry, it discovers its na∣tural 
<PB N="81" REF="78"/> appetites for labour, and industriously be∣gins the
task, which it pursues unremittingly through life. The toil of man is
irksome to him, and he earns his subsistance with pain; but this little
animal seems happy in its pur∣suits, and finds delight in all its
employments.</P>
<P>When just freed from the cell, and pro∣perly equipped by its
fellow bees for duty, it at once issues from the hive, and instructed
only by nature, goes in quest of flowers, chuses only those that yield it
a supply, rejects such as are barren of honey, or have been already drained
by other adventurers; and when load∣ed, is never at a loss to find its way
back to the common habitation. After this first sally, it begins to gather
the mealy powder, that lies on every flower, which is afterwards converted into
wax; and with this, the very first day, it returns with two large balls
stuck to its thighs.</P>
<P>When bees first begin to break their prisons, there are
generally above a hundred excluded in one day. Thus, in the space of a few
weeks, the number of the inhabitants in one hive, of moderate size, becomes
so great, that there is no place to contain the new comers; and they are
scarcely excluded from the cell, when they are obliged, by the old bees, to
sally forth in quest of new habitations. In other words, the 
<PB N="82" REF="79"/> hive begins to swarm, and the new progeny prepares for
exile.</P>
<P>While there is room enough in the hive, the bees remain quietly
together; it is necessity alone that compels the separation. Sometimes,
indeed, the young brood, with graceless ob∣stinacy, refuse to depart, and
even venture to resist their progenitors. The young ones are known by being
browner than the old, with whiter hair; the old ones are of a lighter co∣lour,
with red hair. The two armies are therefore easily distinguishable, and
dreadful battles are often seen to ensue. But the victory almost ever
terminates with strict poetical justice in favour of the veterans, and the
re∣bellious offspring are driven off, not without loss and mutilation.</P>
<P>In different countries, the swarms make their appearance at
different times of the year, and there are several signs previous to this
in∣tended migration. The night before, an un∣usual buzzing is heard in the
hive; in the morning, though the weather be soft and in∣viting, they seem
not to obey the call, being intent on more important meditations within. All
labour is discontinued in the hive, every bee is either employed in forcing,
or reluctant∣ly yielding a submission; at length, after some 
<PB N="83" REF="80"/> noise and tumult, a queen bee is chosen, to guard,
rather than conduct, the young colony to other habitations, and then they are
marshalled with∣out any apparent conductor. In less than a minute, they
leave their native abode, and form∣ing a cloud round their protectress, they
set off, without seeming to know the place of their desti∣nation; 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The world before them, where to chuse
their place of rest.</HI></Q> The usual time of swarming, is from ten in
the morning, to three in the afternoon, when the sun shines bright, and
invites them to seek their fortunes. They flutter for a while, in the air,
like flakes of snow, and sometimes un∣dertake a distant journey, but more
frequently are contented with some neighbouring asylum; the branch of a
tree, a chimney top, or some other exposed situation. It is, indeed,
remark∣able, that all those animals, of what ever kind, that have long been
under the protection of man, seem to lose a part of their natural
saga∣city, in providing for themselves. The rabbit, when domesticated,
forgets to dig holes, the hen to build a nest, and the bee to seek a
shelter, that shall protect it from the inclemen∣cies of winter. In those
countries, where the bees are wild, and unprotected by man, they are always
sure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree; but with us, they
seem im∣provident <PB N="84" REF="81"/> provident in their choice, and the
first green branch that stops their flight, seems to be thought
sufficient for their abode through win∣ter. However, it does not appear, that
the queen chuses the place where they are to alight, for many of the
stragglers, who seem to be pleased with a particular branch, go and
settle upon it; others are seen to succeed, and at last, the queen
herself, when she finds a sufficient number there before her, goes to
make it the place of her head quarters. When the queen is settled, the rest
of the swarm soon follow; and, in about a quarter of an hour, the whole
body seem to be at ease. It sometimes is found, that there are two or
three queens to a swarm, and the colony is divided into parties; but it
most usually happens, that one of these is more considerable than the
other, and the bees by degrees, desert the weakest, to take shelter under
the most powerful protector. The deserted queen does not long survive
this defeat; she takes refuge under the new monarch, and is soon
destroyed by her jealous rival. Till this cruel execution is performed, the
bees never go out to work; and if there should be a queen bee, belonging to
the new colony, left in the old hive, she always under∣goes the fate of the
former. However, it must <PB N="85" REF="82"/> be observed, that the bees
never sacrifice any of their queens, when the hive is full of wax and honey;
for there is at that time, no dan∣ger in maintaining a plurality of
breeders.</P>
<P>When the swarm is thus conducted to a place of rest, and the
policy of government is settled, the bees soon resume their former
la∣bours. The making cells, storing them with honey, impregnating the queen,
making pro∣per cells for the reception of the rising progeny, and protecting
them from external danger, employ their unceasing industry. But soon
after, and towards the latter end of summer, when the colony is
sufficiently stored with in∣habitants, a most cruel policy ensues. The
drone bees, which are (as has been said) ge∣nerally in a hive, to the number
of an hundred, are marked for slaughter. These, which had hitherto led a
life of indolence and pleasure, whose only employment was in impregnating
the queen, and rioting upon the labours of the hive, without aiding in the
general toil, now share the fate of most voluptuaries, and fall a
sacrifice to the general resentment of society.</P>
<P>The working bees, in a body, declare war against them; and in
two or three days time, the ground all round the hive is covered with their
dead bodies. Nay, the working bees <PB N="86" REF="83"/> will even kill such
drones, as are yet in the worm state, in the cell, and eject their bodies
from the hive, among the general carnage.</P>
<P>When a hive sends out several swarms in the year, the
first is always the best, and the most numerous. These, having the
whole summer before them, have the more time for mak∣ing wax and honey, and
consequently their labours are the most valuable to the proprietor.
Although the swarm chiefly consists of the youngest bees, yet it is
often found, that bees of all ages compose the multitude of emigrants, and it
often happens, that bees of all ages are seen remaining behind. The number of
them is always more considerable than that of some populous cities, for
sometimes upwards of forty thousand are found in a single hive. So large
a body may well be supposed to work with great expedition; and in fact, in
less than twenty-four hours, they will make combs above twenty inches long,
and seven or eight broad. Sometimes they will half fill their hives with wax,
in less than five days. In the first fifteen days, they are always found to
make more wax than they do afterwards during the rest of the year.</P>
<P>Such are the out-lines of the natural history of these
annimals, as usually found in our own <PB N="87" REF="84"/> country. How they
are treated, so as to pro∣duce the greatest quantity of honey, belongs
rather to the rural oeconomist, than the natural historian; volumes have
been written on the subject, and still more remains equally curious and
new. One thing, however, it may be pro∣per to observe, that a farm, or a
country, may be over stocked with bees, as with any other sort of animal;
for a certain number of hives, always require a certain number of flowers to
subsist on. When the flowers near home are rifled, then are these
industrious insects seen tak∣ing more extensive ranges, but their
abilities may be over taxed; and if they are obliged, in quest of honey, to
go too far from home, they are over-wearied in the pursuit, they are
devour∣ed by birds, or beat down by the winds and rain.</P>
<P>For a knowledge of this, in some parts of France and Piedmont,
they have contrived, as I have often seen, a kind of floating
bee-house.</P>
<P>They have on board one barge, threescore or an hundred
bee-hives, well defended from the inclemency of an accidental storm; and with
these, the owners suffer themselves to float gently down the river. As
the bees are con∣tinually chusing their flowery pasture along the banks of
the stream, they are furnished with sweets before unrifled; and thus a
single float∣ing <PB N="88" REF="85"/> bee-house, yields the proprietor a
consider∣able income. Why a method similar to this has never been adopted
in England, where we have more gentle rivers, and more flowery banks, than in
any other part of the world, I know not; certainly it might be turned to
ad∣vantage, and yield the possessor a secure, though perhaps a
moderate income.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the industry of these ad∣mirable insects,
it will be proper to say some∣thing of the effects of their labour, of that
wax and honey, which are turned by man to such various uses. Bees gather
two kinds of wax, one coarse and the other fine. The coarser sort is
bitter, and with this, which is called <HI>propolis,</HI> they stop up all
the holes and crevices of their hives. It is of a more resinous nature than
the fine wax, and is consequently better qualified to resist the
moisture of the season, and preserve the works warm and dry within. The
fine wax is as necessary to the animals preservation as the honey
itself. With this they make their lodg∣ings, with this they cover the cells
of their young, and in this they lay up their magazines of honey. This is made,
as has been already observed, from the dust of flowers, which is carefully
kneaded by the little insect, then swallowed, and having undergone a kind
of di∣gestion, <PB N="89" REF="86"/> is formed into the cells, which answers
such a variety of purposes. To collect this, the animal rolls itself in
the flower it would rob, and thus takes up the vegetable dust with the hair
of its body. Then carefully brushing it into a lump, with its fore paws it
thrusts the composition into two cavities behind the thighs, which are made
like spoons to receive the wax, and the hair that lines them, serves to
keep it from falling.</P>
<P>As of wax, there are also two kinds of honey. The white and
the yellow. The white is taken without fire from the honey-combs. The yellow is
extracted by heat, and squeezed through bags, in a press. The best honey
is new, thick and granulated, of a clear transparent white colour, of a
soft and aromatic smell, and of a sweet lively taste. Honey made in
moun∣tainous countries, is preferable to that of the valley. The honey made in
the spring, is more highly esteemed, than that gathered in summer, which
last is still more valuable, than that of autumn, when the flowers begin to
fade and lose their fragrance.</P>
<P>The bees are nearly alike in all parts of the world, yet there
are differences worthy our notice. In Guadaloupe, the bee is less by one
half, than the European, and more black and <PB N="90" REF="87"/> round. They
have no sting, and make their cells in hollow trees; where, if the hole they
meet with is too large, they form a sort of waxen house, of the shape of
a pear, and in this they lodge and store their honey, and lay their eggs.
They lay up their honey in waxen vessels, of the size of a pigeon's egg,
of a black or deep violet colour; and these are so joined to∣gether, that
there is no space left between them. The honey never congeals, but is fluid,
of the consistence of oil, and the colour of amber. Resembling these,
there are found little black bees, without a sting, in all the tropical
cli∣mates; and though these countries are replete with bees, like our own,
yet those form the most useful and laborious tribe in that part of the
world. The honey they produce, is neither so unpalatable, nor so
surfeiting as ours; and the wax is so soft, that it is only used for
medi∣cinal purposes, it being never found hard enough to form into candles,
as in Europe.</P>
<P>Of insects, that receive the name of bees, among us, there are
several; which, however, differ very widely from that industrious social
race we have been just describing. The HUM∣BLE BEE is the largest of all
this tribe, being as large as the first joint of one's middle finger. These
are seen in every field, and perched on <PB N="87" REF="88"/> every flower.
They build their nest in holes in the ground, of dry leaves, mixed with wax
and wool, defended with moss from the weather. Each humble bee makes a
separate cell about the size of a small nutmeg, which is round and
hollow, containing the honey in a bag. Se∣veral of these cells are joined
together, in such a manner, that the whole appears like a cluster of
grapes. The females, which have the ap∣pearance of wasps, are very few, and
their eggs are laid in cells, which the rest soon cover over with wax. It
is uncertain whether they have a queen or not; but there is one much larger
than the rest, without wings, and with∣out hair, and all over black, like
polished ebony. This goes and views all the works, from time to time, and
enters into the cell, as if it wanted to see whether every thing was done
right: In the morning, the young humble bees are very idle, and seem not at
all inclined to labour, till one of the largest, about seven o'clock,
thrusts half its body from a hole, designed for that purpose, and
seated on the top of the nest, beats its wings for twenty minutes
successively, buzzing the whole time, till the whole colony is put in
motion. The humble bees gather honey, as well as the com∣mon 
<PB N="92" REF="89"/> bees; but it is neither so fine, nor so good, nor the
wax so clean, or so capable of fusion.</P>
<P>Besides the bees already mentioned, there are various kinds
among us, that have much the appearance of honey-makers, and yet make only wax.
The WOOD BEE is seen in every garden. It is rather larger than the common
queen bee; its body of a blueish black, which is smooth and shining. It
begins to appear at the ap∣proach of spring, and is seen flying near walls
exposed to a sunny aspect. This bee makes its nest in some piece of
wood, which it contrives to scoop and hollow for its purpose. This,
however, is never done in trees that are stand∣ing, for the wood it makes
choice of is half rotten. The holes are not made directly for∣ward, but turning
to one side, and have an opening sufficient to admit one's middle finger;
from whence runs the inner apartment, gene∣rally twelve or fifteen inches long.
The instru∣ments used in boring these cavities, are their teeth; the
cavity is usually branched into three or four apartments; and in each of
these, they lay their eggs, to the number of ten or twelve, each separate
and distinct from the rest: The egg is involved in a sort of paste,
which serves at once for the young animal's protection <PB N="93" REF="90"/>
and nourishment. The grown bees, however, feed upon small insects,
particularly a louse, of a reddish brown colour, of the size of a small
pin's head.</P>
<P>MASON BEES make their cells with a sort of mortar, made of
earth, which they build against a wall that is exposed to the sun. The
mortar, which at first is soft, soon becomes as hard as stone, and in
this their eggs are laid. Each nest contains seven or eight cells, an egg
in every cell, placed regularly one over the other. If the nest remains
unhurt, or wants but little repairs, they make use of them the year
ensuing: and thus they often serve three or four years successively.
From the strength of their houses, one would think these bees in perfect
security, yet none are more exposed than they. A worm with very strong
teeth, is often found to bore into their little fortifica∣tions, and devour
their young.</P>
<P>The GROUND BEE builds its nest in the earth, wherein they make
round holes, five or six inches deep; the mouth being narrow, and only just
sufficient to admit the little inhabi∣tant. It is amusing enough, to
observe the patience and assiduity with which they labour. They carry out
all the earth, grain by grain, to the mouth of the hole, where it forms a
little <PB N="94" REF="91"/> hillock, an Alps compared to the power of the
artist by which it is raised. Sometimes the walks of a garden are found
undermined by their labours; some of the holes running directly downward,
others horizontally be∣neath the surface. They lay up in these ca∣vities
provisions for their young, which consist of a paste that has the
appearance of corn, and is of a sweetish taste.</P>
<P>The LEAF-CUTTING BEES make their nest and lay their eggs among
bits of leaves, very artificially placed in holes in the earth, of about the
length of a tooth-pick case. They make the bits of leaves of a roundish
form, and with them line the inside of their habita∣tions. This tapestry is
still further lined by a reddish kind of paste, somewhat sweet or
acid. These bees are of various kinds; those that build their nests with
chesnut-leaves are as big as drones, but those of the rose-tree are
smaller than the common bee.</P>
<P>The WALL BEES are so called, because they make their nests
in walls of a kind of silky membrane with which they fill up the vacuities
between the small stones which form the sides of their habitation. Their
apartment consists of several cells placed end to end, each in the
shape of a woman's thimble. Though the <PB N="95" REF="92"/> web which lines
this habitation is thick and warm, yet it is transparent and of a whitish
colour. This substance is supposed to be spun from the animal's body;
the male and females are of a size, but the former are without a sting. To
these varieties of the bee kind might be added several others which are all
different in nature, but not sufficiently distinguished to excite
curiosity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Wasp and Hornet.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER similar many insects may be in appearance, this does
not imply a similitude in their history. The bee and the wasp re∣semble
each other very strongly, yet, in ex∣amining their manner and their duration,
they differ very widely; the bee labours to lay up honey, and lives to enjoy
the fruits of its indu∣stry; the wasp appears equally assiduous, but
only works for posterity, as the habitation is scarcely completed when the
inhabitant dies.</P>
<P>The wasp is well known to be a winged in∣sect with a
sting. To be longer in proportion to its bulk than the bee, to be marked with
bright yellow circles round its body, and to be the most swift and active
insect of all the fly kind. On each side of the mouth this animal is
furnished with a long tooth, notched like a saw, and with these it is
enabled to cut any substance, not omitting meat itself, and to carry it
to its nest. Wasps live like bees in community, and sometimes ten or
twelve thousand are found inhabiting a single nest.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="94"/>Of all other insects the wasp is the
most fierce, voracious, and most dangerous, when enraged. They are seen
wherever flesh is cutting up, gorging themselves with the spoil, and then
flying to their nests with their reeking prey. They make war also on every
other fly, and the spider himself dreads their ap∣proaches.</P>
<P>Every community among bees is composed of females or queens,
drones or males, and neutral or working bees. Wasps have similar
occupations; the two first are for propagating the species, the last for
nursing, defending and supporting the rising progeny. Among bees,
however, there is seldom above a queen or two in an hive; among wasps there
are above two or three hundred.</P>
<P>As soon as the summer begins to invigorate the insect
tribes, the wasps are the most of the number, and diligently employed
either in providing provisions for their nest, if already made, or in
making one, if the former habi∣tation be too small to receive the
encreasing community. The nest is one of the most cu∣rious objects in
natural history, and contrived almost as artificially as that of the bees
them∣selves. Their principal care is to seek out an hole that has been
begun by some other ani∣mal, <PB N="98" REF="95"/> a field mouse, a rat, or
a mole, to build their nests in. They sometimes build upon the plain, where
they are sure of the dryness of their situation, but most commonly on
the side of a bank to avoid the rain or water that would otherwise annoy
them. When they have chosen a proper place they go to work with wonderful
assiduity. Their first labour is to enlarge and widen the hole, taking
away the earth and carrying it off to some distance. They are perfectly
formed for labour, being furnished with a trunk above their mouths, two
saws on each side which play to the right and left against each other,
and six strong muscu∣lar legs to support them. They cut the earth into
small parcels with their saws, and carry it out with their legs or paws.
This is the work of some days; and at length the outline of their habitation
is formed, making a cavity of about a foot and an half every way. While some
are working in this manner, others are roving the fields to seek out
materials for their building. To prevent the earth from falling down and
crushing their rising city into ruin, they make a sort of roof with their
gluey substance, to which they begin to fix the ru∣diments of their
building, working from the top downwards, as if they were hanging a 
<PB N="99" REF="96"/> bell, which, however at length they close up at the
bottom. The materials with which they build their nests are bits of wood and
glue. The wood they get where they can from the rails and posts which they
meet with in the fields and elsewhere. These they saw and di∣vide into a
multitude of small fibres, of which they take up little bundles in their
claws, letting fall upon them a few drops of gluey matter with which their
bodies are provided, by the help of which they knead the whole composition
into a paste, which serves them in their future building. When they have
returned with this to the nest, they stick their load of paste on that
part where they make their walls and par∣titions; they tread it close with
their feet, and trowel it with their trunks, still going back∣wards as they
work. Having repeated this ope∣ration three or four times, the composition is
at length flatted out until it becomes a small leaf of a grey colour, much
finer than paper, and of a pretty firm texture. This done the same wasp
returns to the field to collect a second load of paste, repeating the
same several times, placing layer upon layer, and strengthening eve∣ry
partition in proportion to the wants or con∣veniencies of the general fabric.
Other work∣ing wasps come quickly after to repeat the same 
<PB N="100" REF="97"/> operation, laying more leaves upon the former, till at
length, after much toil, they have finish∣ed the large roof which is to
secure them from the tumbling in of the earth. This dome be∣ing finished,
they make another entrance to their habitation, designed either for letting
in the warmth of the sun, or for escaping in case one door be invaded by
plunderers. Cer∣tain however it is, that by one of these they al∣ways enter,
by the other they sally forth to their toil; each hole being so small
that they can pass but one at a time. The walls being thus composed, and
the whole somewhat of the shape of a pear, they labour at their cells,
which they compose of the same paper-like substance that goes to the
formation of their outside works. Their combs differ from those of bees,
not less in the composition than the position which they are always
seen to obtain. The honey-comb of the bee is edgeways with respect to the
hive; that of the wasp is flat, and the mouth of every cell opens downwards.
Thus is their habitation, contrived story above story, supported by
several rows of pillars which give firmness to the whole building, while
the upper story is flat-roofed, and as smooth as the pave∣ment of a room,
laid with squares of marble. The wasps can freely walk upon these
stories <PB N="101" REF="98"/> between the pillars to do whatever their wants
require. The pillars are very hard and com∣pact, being larger at each end than
in the middle, not much unlike the columns of a building. All the cells of the
nest are only de∣stined for the reception of the young, being replete with
neither wax nor honey.</P>
<P>Each cell is like that of the bee, hexagonal; but they are of
two sorts, the one larger for the production of the male and female wasps,
the other less for the reception of the working part of the community. When
the females are im∣pregnated by the males, they lay their eggs, one in each
cell, and stick it in with a kind of gummy matter to prevent its falling out.
From this egg proceeds the insect in its worm-state, of which the old ones
are extremely careful, feeding it from time to time till it becomes large and
entirely fills up its cell. But the wasp community differs from that of the
bee in this; that among the latter the working bees take the parental duties
upon them, whereas among the wasps the females alone are permitted to feed
their young, and to nurse their rising pro∣geny. For this purpose the
female waits with great patience till the working wasps have brought in their
provisions, which she takes from them, and cuts into pieces. She then goes 
<PB N="102" REF="99"/> with great composure from cell to cell, and feeds every
young one with her mouth. When the young worms have come to a certain size
they leave off eating, and begin to spin a very fine silk, fixing the
first end to the entrance of the cell, then turning their heads, first on
one side, then on the other, they fix the thread to different parts, and thus
they make a sort of a door which serves to close up the mouth of the
cell. After this they divest themselves of their skins after the usual
mode of transforma∣tion, the aurelia by degrees begins to emanci∣pate itself
from its shell; by little and little it thrusts out its legs and wings, and
insensibly acquires the colour and shape of its parent.</P>
<P>The wasp thus formed, and prepared for de∣predation, becomes a
bold, troublesome, and dangerous insect: there are no dangers which it will
not encounter in pursuit of its prey, and nothing seems to satiate its
gluttony. Though it can gather no honey of its own, no animal is more fond of
sweets. For this purpose it will pursue the bee and the humble bee,
de∣stroy them with its sting, and then plunder them of their honey-bag,
with which it flies triumphantly loaded to its nest to regale its young.
Wasps are ever fond of making their nests in the neighbourhood of bees,
merely to <PB N="103" REF="100"/> have an opportunity of robbing their hives,
and feasting on the spoil. Yet the bees are not found always patiently
submissive to their ty∣ranny, but fierce battles are sometimes seen
to ensue, in which the bees make up by conduct and numbers what they want in
personal prow∣ess. When there is no honey to be had, they seek for the
best and sweetest fruits, and they are never mistaken in their choice.
From the garden they fly to the city, to the grocers shops, and butchers
shambles. They will sometimes carry off bits of flesh half as big as
themselves, with which they fly to their nests for the nourishment of
their brood. Those who cannot drive them away, lay for them a piece of ox's
liver, which being without fibres, they prefer to other flesh; and whenever
they are found, all other flies are seen to desert the place immediately.
Such is the dread with which these little animals impress all the rest of
the insect tribes, which they seize and devour without mercy, that they
vanish at their ap∣proach. Wherever they fly, like the eagle or the falcon,
they form a desert in the air around them. In this manner the summer is
passed in plundering the neighbourhood, and rearing up their young; every
day adds to their numbers; and from their strength, agility, and
indiscriminate appetite for every kind of pro∣vision, <PB N="104" REF="101"/> were they as long lived as the bee, they would soon swarm upon
the face of nature, and become the most noxious plague of man: but
providentially their lives are measured to their mischief, and they live
but a single sea∣son.</P>
<P>While the summer heats continue, they are bold, voracious, and
enterprizing; but as the sun withdraws, it seems to rob them of their
courage and activity. In proportion as the cold encreases, they are seen to
become more do∣mestic; they seldom leave the nest, they make but short
adventures from home, they flutter about in the noon-day heats, and soon
after return chilled and feeble.</P>
<P>As their calamities encrease, new passions soon begin to
take place; the care for poste∣rity no longer continues, and as the parents
are no longer able to provide their grow∣ing progeny a supply, they take the
barba∣rous resolution of sacrificing them all to the necessity of the
times. In this manner, like a garrison upon short allowance, all the
useless hands are destroyed; the young worms, which a little before they
fed and protected with so much assiduity, are now butchered and dragged
fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m their cells. As the cold
encreases they no longer find sufficient warmth in their nests, which
grow hateful to them, and they fly to <PB N="105" REF="102"/> seek it in the
corners of houses, and places that receive an artificial heat. But the winter
is still insupportable; and, before the new year begins, they wither and
die; the working bees first, the males soon following, and many of the
fe∣males suffering in the general calamity. In every nest, however, one or
two females survive the winter, and having been impregnated by the male
during the preceding season, she begins in spring to lay her eggs in a
little hole of her own contrivance. This bundle of eggs, which is clustered
together like grapes, soon produces two worms which the female takes proper
pre∣caution to defend and supply, and these when hatched soon give
assistance to the female, who is employed in hatching two more; these
also gathering strength, extricate themselves out of the web that
enclosed them, and become likewise assistants to their mother;
fifteen days after, two more make their appearance; thus is the community every
day encreasing, while the female lays in every cell, first a male and then
a female. These soon after become breed∣ers in turn, till, from a single
female, ten thou∣sand wasps are seen produced before the month of June.
After the female has thus produ∣ced her progeny, which are distributed in
dif∣ferent districts, they assemble from all parts, <PB N="106" REF="103"/> in the middle of summer, and provide for themselves the large
and commodious habita∣tion, which has been described above.</P>
<P>Such is the history of the social wasp; but, as among
bees, so also among these insects, there are various tribes that live
in solitude: these lay their eggs in a hole for the purpose, and the
parent dies long before the birth of its offspring. In the principal species
of the SOLITARY WASPS, the insect is smaller than the working wasp of the
social kind. The fila∣ment, by which the corselet is joined to the body, is
longer and more distinctly seen, and the whole colour of the insect is
blacker than in the ordinary kinds. But it is not their figure, but the manners
of this extraordinary insect that claim our principal regard.</P>
<P>From the end of May to the beginning of July, this wasp is
seen most diligently em∣ployed. The whole purpose of its life seems to
be in contriving and fitting up a commodious apartment for its young one, which
is not to succeed it till the year ensuing. For this end it is employed,
with unwearied assiduity, in boring a hole into the finest earth some
inches deep, but not much wider than the diameter of its own body. This is but
a gallery lead∣ing to a wider apartment destined for the con∣venient 
<PB N="107" REF="104"/> lodgment of its young. As it always chuses a gravelly
soil to work in, and where the earth is almost as hard as stone itself;
the digging and hollowing this apartment is an enterprize of no small labour:
for effecting its operations, this insect is furnished with two teeth,
which are strong and firm, but not sufficiently hard to penetrate the
substance through which it is resolved to make its way. In order
therefore to soften that earth which it is unable to pierce, it is
furnished with a gummy liquor which it emits upon the place, and which
renders it more easily separable from the rest, and the whole becoming a
kind of soft paste is removed to the mouth of the habi∣tation. The animal's
provision of liquor in these operations is however soon exhausted; and
it is then seen either taking up water from some neighbouring flower or
stream in order to supply the deficiency.</P>
<P>At length, after much toil, a hole some inches deep is formed,
at the bottom of which is a large cavity; and to this no other hostile
insect would venture to find its way, from the length and the narrowness of
the defile through which it would be obliged to pass. In this the solitary
wasp lays its egg, which is destined to continue the species; there the
nascent animal <PB N="108" REF="105"/> is to continue for above nine months,
unattend∣ed and immured, and at first appearance the most helpless
insect of the creation. But when we come to examine, new wonders offer, no
other insect can boast so copiously luxurious a provision, or such
confirmed security.</P>
<P>As soon as the mother wasp has deposited her egg at the
bottom of the hole, her next care is to furnish it with a supply of
provisions, which may be offered to the young insect as soon as it leaves
the egg. To this end she procures a number of little green worms, generally
from eight to twelve, and these are to serve as food for the young one the
instant it awakens into life. When this supply is regularly arranged and
laid in, the old one then, with as much assiduity as it before worked out
its hole, now closes the mouth of the passage; and thus leaving its young
one immured in perfect se∣curity, and in a copious supply of animal food,
she dies satisfied with having provided for a future progeny.</P>
<P>When the young one leaves the egg it is scarcely visible,
and is seen immured among a number of insects, infinitely larger than
itself, ranged in proper order around it, which, how∣ever give it no manner
of apprehension. Whe∣ther the parent, when she laid in the insect 
<PB N="109" REF="106"/> provision, contrived to disable the worms from
resistance, or whether they were at first incapa∣ble of any, is not
known. Certain it is, that the young glutton feasts upon the living spoil
without any controul; his game lies at his hand, and he devours one after the
other as the calls of appetite incite him. The life of the young animal is
therefore spent in the most luxurious manner, till its whole stock of
worms is exhausted, and then the time of its transfor∣mation begins to
approach; and then spinning a silken web, it continues fixed in its cell
till the sun calls it from its dark abode the ensuing summer.</P>
<P>The wasps of Europe are very mischievous, yet they are
innocence itself when compared to those of the tropical climates, where all
the insect tribes are not only numerous, but large, voracious, and
formidable. Those of the West Indies are thicker, and twice as long as the
common bee; they are of a grey colour, striped with yellow, and armed with a
very dangerous sting. They make their cells in the manner of a honey-comb, in
which the young ones are hatched and bred. They generally hang their nests by
threads, composed of the same substance with the cells, to the branches
of trees, and the eaves of houses. They are <PB N="110" REF="107"/> seen
every where in great abundance, de∣scending like fruit, particularly pears,
of which shape they are, and as large as one's head. The inside is divided
into three round stories, full of cells, each hexagonal, like those of an
honey-comb. In some of the islands, these insects are so very
numerous, that their nests are stuck up in this manner, scarce two feet
asunder, and the inhabitants are in con∣tinual apprehension from their
accidental re∣sentment. It sometimes happens, that no pre∣cautions can
prevent their attacks, and the pains of their sting is almost
insupportable. Those who have felt it think it more terrible than even that
of a scorpion; the whole visage swells, and the features are so
disfigured, that a person is scarcely known by his most intimate
acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Ichnumon Fly.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY rank of insects, how voracious soever, have enemies
that are terrible to them, and that revenge upon them the injuries done upon
the rest of the animated creation. The wasp, as we have seen, is very
troublesome to man, and very formidable to the insect tribe; but the
ichnumon fly (of which there are many varieties) fears not the wasp itself,
it enters its retreats, plunders its habitations, and takes possession
of that cell for its own young, which the wasp had laboriously built for a
dearer posterity.</P>
<P>Though there are many different kinds of this insect, yet the
most formidable, and that best known, is called the common ichnumon, with
four wings, like the bee, a long slender black body, and a three forked tail,
consisting of bristles; the two outermost black, and the middlemost
red. This fly receives its name from the little quadrupede, which is found to
be so destructive to the crocodile, as it bears a strong similitude in
its courage and rapacity.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="109"/>Though this instrument is, to all
appearance, slender and feeble, yet it is found to be a wea∣pon of great
force and efficacy. There is scarce any substance which it will not
pierce; and, indeed, it is seldom seen but employed in pe∣netration. This
is the weapon of defence, this is employed in destroying its prey, and
still more, by this the animal deposites her eggs where∣ever she thinks
fit to lay them. As it is an instrument chiefly employed for this purpose,
the male is unprovided with such a sting, while the female uses it with
great force and dexterity, brandishing it when caught, from side to side,
and very often wounding those who thought they held her with the greatest
security.</P>
<P>All the flies of this tribe are produced in the same manner,
and owe their birth to the de∣struction of some other insect, within
whose body they have been deposed, and upon whose vitals they have
preyed, till they came to ma∣turity. There is no insect whatever, which they
will not attack, in order to leave their fatal present in its body; the
caterpillar, the gnat, and even the spider himself, so formid∣able to
others, is often made the unwilling fosterer of this destructive
progeny.</P>
<P>About the middle of summer, when other insects are found in
great abundance, the ich∣numon <PB N="113" REF="110"/> is seen flying busily
about, and seeking proper objects upon whom to depose its pro∣geny. As
there are various kinds of this fly, so they seem to have various
appetites. Some are found to place their eggs within the aurelia of some
nascent insect, others place them within the nest, which the wasp had
curiously contrived for its own young; and as both are produced at the same
time, the young of the ichnumon, not only devours the young wasp, but the
whole supply of worms, which the parent had carefully provided for its
provision. But the greatest number of the ichnumon tribe are seen
settling upon the back of the caterpillar, and darting, at different
intervals, their stings into its body. At every dart they depose an egg,
while the wounded animal seems scarcely sensi∣ble of the injury it
sustains. In this manner they leave from six to a dozen of their eggs,
within the fatty substance of the reptile's body, and then fly off to
commit further depredations. In the mean time the caterpillar thus irreparably
injured, seems to feed as voraciously as before, does not abate of its
usual activity; and to all appearance, seems no way affected by the
in∣ternal enemies that are preparing its destruction in their darksome
abode. But they soon burst from their egg state, and begin to prey upon 
<PB N="114" REF="111"/> the substance of their prison. As they grow
larger, they require a greater supply, till at last the animal, by whose
vitals they are sup∣ported, is no longer able to sustain them, but dies;
its whole inside being almost eaten away. It often happens, however, that
it survives their worm state, and then they change into a chrysalis,
enclosed in the caterpillar's body till the time of their delivery
approaches, when they burst their prisons and fly away. The caterpillar,
however, is irreparably destroyed, it never changes into a chrysalis, but
dies shortly after, from the injuries it had sustained.</P>
<P>Such is the history of this fly, which though very terrible to
the insect tribe, fails not to be of infinite service to mankind. The
millions which it kills in a single summer, are uncon∣ceiveable; and
without such a destroyer, the fruits of the earth would only rise to
furnish a banquet for the insect race, to the exclusion of all the nobler
ranks of animated nature.</P>

<PB N="115" REF="112"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Ant.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the number of two winged flies be very great, and the
naturalists have taken some pains to describe their characters and
varieties; yet there is such a similitude in their forms and manners, that
in a work like this, one description must serve for all. We now
therefore, come to a species of four winged insects, that are famous from
all antiquity, for their social and industrious habits, that are marked for
their spirit of subordination, that are offered as a pattern of
parsimony, to the profuse, and of unremitting diligence to the
sluggard.</P>
<P>In the experiments, however, which have been more recently made,
and the observations which have been taken, much of their boasted frugality
and precaution seems denied them; the treasures they lay up, are no longer
sup∣posed, intended for future provision, and the choice they make in
their stores, seems no way dictated by wisdom. It is, indeed, somewhat
surprizing, that almost every writer of antiqui∣ty, should describe
this insect, as labouring in the summer, and feasting upon the produce 
<PB N="116" REF="113"/> during the winter. Perhaps, in some of the warmer
climates, where the winter is mild, and of short contiuance, this may take
place; but in France and England, these animals can have no manner of
occasion for a supply of winter provisions, as they are actually in a
state of torpidity during that season.</P>
<P>The common ants of Europe, are of two or three different kinds;
some red, some black, some with stings, and others without. Such as
have stings, inflict their wounds in that manner; such as are unprovided
with these weapons of defence, have a power of spurting, from their hinder
parts, an acid pungent liquor, which, if it lights upon the skin, inflames
and burns it like nettles.</P>
<P>The body of an ant is divided, into the head, breast and
belly. In the head, the eyes are placed, which are entirely black, and under
the eyes, there are two small horns or feelers, composed of twelve joints,
all covered with a fine silky hair. The mouth is furnished with two crooked
jaws, which project outwards, in each of which are seen incisures, that
look like teeth. The breast is covered with a fine silky hair, from which
project six legs, that are pretty strong and hairy, the extremities of each
armed with two small claws, which the animal uses in <PB N="117" REF="114"/>
climbing. The belly is more reddish than the rest of the body, which is of
a brown chesnut colour, it is as shining as glass, and covered with
extremely fine hair.</P>
<P>From such a formation, this animal seems bolder, and more
active, for its size, than any other of the insect tribe, and fears not to
attack a creature, often above ten times its own mag∣nitude.</P>
<P>As soon as the winter is past, in the first fine day in
April, the ant hill, that before seemed a desart, now swarms with new
life, and myriads of these insects are seen just awaked from their
annual lethargy, and preparing for the pleasures and fatigues of the
season. For the first day they never offer to leave the hill, which may
be considered as their citadel, but run over every part of it, as if to
examine its present situation, to observe what injuries it has
sustained during the rigours of winter,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires pour servoir a l' Histoire des insectes par
Charles de Geer.</BIBL></NOTE> while they slept, and to mediate and settle
the labours of the day ensuing.</P>
<P>At the first display of their forces, none but the
wingless tribe appears, while those furnish∣ed with wings remain at the
bottom. These are the working ants, that first appear, and that 
<PB N="118" REF="115"/> are always destitute of wings; the males and females,
that are furnished with four large wings each, are more slow in making
their ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>Thus, like bees, they are divided into males, females, and the
neutral or the working tribe. These are all easily distinguished from
each other; the females are much larger than the males; the working ants are
the smallest of all. The two former have wings; which, however, they
sometimes are divested of; the latter never have any, and upon them are
devolved all the labours that tend to the welfare of the commu∣nity. The
female, also, may be distinguished, by the colour and structure of her
breast, which is a little more brown, than that of the common ant, and a
little brighter than that of the male.</P>
<P>In eight or ten days after their first appear∣ance, the
labours of the hill are in some for∣wardness; the males and females are
seen mix∣ed with the working multitude, and pursued or pursuing each
other. They seem no way to partake in the common drugeries of the state;
the males pursue the females with great assiduity, and in a manner, force
them to compliance. They remain coupled for some time, while the males thus
united, suffer themselves to be drawn along by the will of their
partners.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="116"/>In the mean time, the working body of the
state take no part in their pleasures, they are seen diligently going
from the ant-hill, in pursuit of food for themselves and their
asso∣ciates, and of proper materials for giving a comfortable retreat to
their young, or safety to their habitation. In the fields of England,
ant-hills are formed with but little apparent regularity. In the more
southern provinces of Europe, they are constructed with wonderful
contrivance, and offer a sight highly worthy a naturalist's curiosity.
These are generally formed in the neighbourhood of some large tree and a
stream of water. The one is con∣sidered by the animals, as the proper place
for getting food; the other for supplying them with moisture, which they
cannot well dispense with. The shape of the ant-hill, is that of a
sugar loaf, about three feet high, composed of various substances;
leaves, bits of wood, sand, earth, bits of gum, and grains of corn. These
are all united into a compact body, perforated with galleries down to the
bottom, and wind∣ing ways within the body of the structure. From this
retreat, to the water, as well as to the tree, in different directions, there
are many paths worn by constant assiduity, and along these the busy
insects are seen passing and re∣passing <PB N="120" REF="117"/>
continually; so that from May, or the beginning of June, according to the
state of the season, they work continually, till the bad weather comes
on.</P>
<P>The chief employment of the working ants, is in sustaining
not only the idlers at home, but also finding a sufficiency of food for
them∣selves. They live upon various provisions, as well of the vegetable as
of the animal kind. Small insects they will kill and devour; sweets of all
kinds, they are particularly fond of. They seldom, however, think of their
com∣munity, till they themselves are first satiated. Having found a juicy
fruit, they swallow what they can, and then tearing it in pieces, carry home
their load. If they meet with an insect above their match, several of them
will fall upon it at once, and having mangled it, each will carry off a part of
the spoil. If they meet, in their excursions, any thing that is too heavy
for one to bear, and yet, which they are unable to divide, several of them
will endeavour to force it along; some dragging and others push∣ing. If any
one of them happens to make a lucky discovery, it will immediately give
ad∣vice to others, and then at once, the whole republic will put themselves
in motion. If in these struggles, one of them happens to be 
<PB N="121" REF="118"/> killed, some kind survivor will carry him off to a
great distance, to prevent the obstructions his body may give to the
general spirit of industry.</P>
<P>But while they are thus employed in support∣ing the state,
in feeding abroad, and carrying in provisions to those that continue at
home, they are not unmindful of posterity. After a few days of fine weather,
the female ants begin to lay their eggs, and those are as assidu∣ously
watched and protected by the working ants, who take upon themselves to
supply whatever is wanting to the nascent animal's convenience or
necessity. They are carried as soon as laid, to the safest
situation, at the bot∣tom of their hill, where they are carefully de∣fended
from cold and moisture. We are not to suppose, that those white
substances which we so plentifully find in every ant-hill, are the eggs
as newly laid. On the contrary, the ant's egg is so very small, that,
though laid upon a black ground, it can scarcely be discerned. The little
white bodies we see, are the young animals in their maggot state, endued
with life, long since freed from the egg, and often in∣volved in a cone,
which it has spun round it∣self, like the silk worm. The real egg when
laid, if viewed through a microscope, appears smooth, polished and
shining, while the mag∣got <PB N="122" REF="119"/> is seen composed of
twelve rings, and is oftener larger than the ant itself.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express the fond attach∣ment which the
working ants shew to their rising progeny. In cold weather they take them
in their mouths, but without offering them the smallest injury, to the very
depths of their ha∣bitation, where they are less subject to the severity
of the season. In a fine day they re∣move them, with the same care,
nearer the sur∣face, where their maturity may be assisted by the warm
beams of the sun. If a formidable enemy should come to batter down their
whole habitation, and crush them by thousands in the ruin, yet these
wonderful insects, still mindful of their parental duties, make it their
first care to save their offspring. They are seen running wildly about
and different ways, each loaded with a young one, often bigger than the
insect that supports it. I have kept, says Swammer∣dam, several of the
working ants in my closet, with their young, in a glass filled with earth.
I took pleasure in observing, that in proportion as the earth dried on the
surface, they dug deeper and deeper to deposite their eggs; and when I
poured water thereon, it was surprising to see with what care, affection,
and diligence they laboured, to put their brood in safety, in 
<PB N="123" REF="120"/> the driest place. I have seen also, that when
water has been wanting for several days, and when the earth was moistened
after it a little, they immediately carried their young ones to have a share,
who seemed to enjoy and suck the moisture.</P>
<P>When the young maggot is come to its full growth, the breast
swells insensibly, it casts its skin, and loses all motion. All the
members which were hidden before, then begin to appear, an aurelia is formed,
which represents very distinctly, all the parts of the animal, though they
are yet without mo∣tion, and as it were, wrapped up in swaddling-cloaths.
When at length, the little insect has passed through all its changes, and
acquired its proper maturity, it bursts this last skin, to as∣sume
the form it is to retain ever after. Yet this is not done by the efforts of the
little ani∣mal alone, for the old ones very assiduously break open, with
their teeth, the covering in which it is enclosed. Without this
assistance the aurelia would never be able to get free, as Mr. De Geer
often found, who tried the expe∣riment, by leaving the aurelia to themselves.
The old ones not only assist them, but know the very precise time for
lending their assistance, for if produced too soon the young one dies
of <PB N="124" REF="121"/> cold, if retarded too long it is suffocated in its
prison.</P>
<P>When the female has done laying, and the whole brood is thus
produced, her labours, as well as that of the male, become unnecessary, and
her wings, which she had but a short time before so actively employed,
drop off. What becomes of her when thus divested of her orna∣ments is not
well known, for she is seen in the cells for some weeks after. The males,
on the other hand, having no longer any occupation at home, make use of
those wings with which they have been furnished by nature, and fly away,
never to return, or to be heard of more. It is probable they perish with the
cold, or are de∣voured by the birds, which are particularly fond of this petty
prey.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the working ants having probably deposed
their queens, and being de∣serted by the males, that served but to clog the
community, prepare for the severity of the win∣ter, and bury their retreats
as deep in the earth as they conveniently can. It is now found that the grains
of corn, and other substances with which they furnish their hill, are
only meant as fences to keep off the rigours of the weather, not as
provisions to support them during its con∣tinuance. It is found generally
to obtain, that <PB N="125" REF="122"/> every insect that lives a year after
it is come to its full growth, is obliged to pass four or five months without
taking any nourishment, and will seem to be dead all that time. It would be
to no purpose therefore for ants to lay up corn for the winter, since they
lie that time without motion, heaped upon each other, and are so far from
eating, that they are utterly unable to stir. Thus what authors have
dignified by the name of a magazine, appears to be no more than a cavity, which
serves for a common re∣treat when the weather forces them to return to their
lethargic state.</P>
<P>What has been said with exaggeration of the European ant, is
however true, if asserted of those of the tropical climates. They build
an ant-hill with great contrivance and regularity, they lay up provisions,
and, as they probably live the whole year, they submit themselves to
regulations entirely unknown among the ants of Europe.</P>
<P>Those of Africa are of three kinds, the red, the green and the
black; the latter are above an inch long, and in every respect a most
for∣midable insect. Their sting produces extreme pain, and their
depredations are sometimes ex∣tremely destructive. They build an ant-hill
of a very great size, from six to twelve feet high; <PB N="126" REF="123"/>
it is made of viscous clay, and tapers into a py∣ramidal form. This
habitation is constructed with great artifice, and the cells are so
nume∣rous and even, that a honey-comb scarce ex∣ceeds them in number and
regularity.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this edifice seem to be un∣der a very
strict regulation. At the slightest warning they will sally out upon
whatever dis∣turbs them, and if they have time to arrest their enemies, he
is sure to find no mercy. Sheep, hens, and even rats are often destroyed by
these merciless insects, and their flesh devoured to the bone. No
anatomist in the world can strip a skeleton so cleanly as they, and no
animal, how strong soever, when they have once seized upon it, has power
to resist them.</P>
<P>It often happens that these insects quit their retreat in a
body, and go in quest of adventures. 
<Q REND="inline">"During my stay," says Smith, "at Cape
Corse Castle, a body of these ants came to pay us a visit in our
fortification. It was about day-break when the advanced guard of this
famished crew entered the chapel, where some negroe servants were
asleep upon the floor. The men were quickly alarmed at the invasion of this
unexpected army, and prepared, as well as they could, for a de∣fence. While the
foremost battalion of in∣sects <PB N="127" REF="124"/> had already taken
possession of the place, the rear guard was more than a quarter of a
mile distant. The whole ground seemed alive and crawling with unceasing
destruc∣tion. After deliberating a few moments up∣on what was to be done, it
was resolved to lay a large train of gunpowder along the path they had taken,
by this means millions were blown to pieces, and the rear guard peceiv∣ing the
destruction of their leaders, thought proper instantly to return, and make
back to their original habitation."</Q></P>
<P>The order which these ants observe, seems very
extraordinary; whenever they sally forth, fifty or sixty larger than the
rest are seen to head the band, and conduct them to their destined prey.
If they have a fixed spot where their prey continues to resort to, they
then form a vaulted gallery, which is sometimes a quarter of a mile in
length, and yet, they will hollow it out in the space of ten or twelve
hours.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="128" REF="125"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Beetle and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have been treating of in∣sects with four
transparent wings, we now come to a tribe with two transparent wings, with
cases that cover them close while at rest, but which allow them their
proper play when fly∣ing. The principal of these are the Beetle, the May Bug,
and the Cantharis. These are all bred like the rest of their order, first
from eggs, then they become grubs, then a chrysalis in which the parts of the
future fly are distinctly seen, and lastly the animal leaves its
prison, breaking forth as a winged animal in full ma∣turity.</P>
<P>Of the Beetle there are various kinds; all, however, concurring
in one common formation of having cases to their wings, which are the more
necessary to those insects, as they often live under the surface of
the earth, in holes, which they dig out by their own industry. These
cases prevent the various injuries their real wings might sustain, by
rubbing or crushing against the sides of their abode. These, though 
<PB REF="126"/> 
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of some types of
beetles</FIGDESC>
<HEAD>Beetles.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>E. Martin sculp.</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="129" REF="127"/> they do not assist flight,
yet keep the internal wings clean and even, and produce a loud buzzing noise,
when the animal rises in the air.</P>
<P>If we examine the formation of all animals, of the beetle kind,
we shall find, as in shell-fish, that their bones are placed externally,
and their muscles within. These muscles are formed very much like those
of quadrupedes, and are endued with such surprizing strength, that bulk
for bulk, they are a thousand times stronger than those of a man. The
strength of these muscles is of use in digging the animal's
subterraneous abode, where it is most usually hatched, and to which it
most frequently re∣turns, even after it becomes a winged insect, capable of
flying.</P>
<P>Beside the difference which results from the shape and
colour of these animals, the size also makes a considerable one; some
beetles being not larger than the head of a pin, while others, such as the
elephant beetle, are as big as ones fist: But the greatest difference among
them is, that some are produced in a month, and in a single season go
through all the stages of their existence, while others take near four
years to their production; and live as winged insects a year more. To give
the history of all these <PB N="130" REF="128"/> animals, that are bred
pretty much in the same way, would be insipid and endless; it will
suffice to select one or two from the number, the origin of which may
serve as specimens of the rest. I will, therefore, offer the history of
the may-bug to the reader's attention; pre∣mising, that most other beetles,
though not so long lived, are bred in the same manner.</P>
<P>The may-bug, or dorr-beetle, as some call it, has, like all
the rest, a pair of cases to its wings, which are of a reddish brown
colour, sprinkled with a whitish dust, which easily comes off. In
some years their necks are seen covered with a red plate, and in others,
with a black; these, however, are distinct sorts, and their difference is
by no means accidental. The fore legs are very short, and the better
calculated for burrowing in the ground, where this insect makes its retreat.
It is well known for its evening buzz to children; but till more formidably
introduced to the acquaintance of husbandmen and gardeners, for in some
seasons, it has been found to swarm in such numbers, as to eat up every
vegetable production.</P>
<P>The two sexes in the may-bug, are easily distinguished
from each other, by the superior length of the tufts, at the end of the
horns, in <PB N="131" REF="129"/> the male. They begin to copulate in summer,
and at that season, they are seen joined together for a considerable
time. The female being im∣pregnated, quickly falls to boring a hole into the
ground, where to deposit her burthen. This is generally about half a foot
deep, and in it the places her eggs, which are of an oblong shape, with great
regularity, one by the other. They are of a bright yellow colour, and no way
wrapped up in a common covering, as some have imagined. When the female is
lightened of her burthen, she again ascends from her hole, to live as
before, upon leaves and ve∣getables, to buzz in the summer evening, and to
lie hid, among the branches of trees, in the heat of the day.</P>
<P>In about three months after these eggs have been thus
deposited in the earth, the contain∣ed insect begins to break its shell,
and a small grub or maggot crawls forth, and feeds upon the roots of whatever
vegetable it happens to be nearest. All substances, of this kind, seem
equally grateful, yet it is probable the mother insect has a choice among
what kind of veget∣ables she shall deposit her young. In this manner
these voracious creatures continue in the worm state, for more than three
years, devouring the roots of every plant they ap∣proach, <PB N="132" REF="130"/> and making their way under ground, in quest of food, with great
dispatch and facility. At length they grow to above the size of a walnut,
being a great thick white maggot with a red head, which is seen most
frequently in new turned earth, and which is so eagerly sought after by
birds of every species. When largest, they are found an inch and an half
long, of a whitish yellow colour, with a body consisting of twelve
seg∣ments or joints, on each side of which, there are nine breathing holes,
and three red feet. The head is large, in proportion to the body, of a
reddish colour, with a pincer before, and a semi-circular lip, with which
it cuts the roots of plants, and sucks out their moisture. As this insect
lives entirely under ground, it has no occasion for eyes, and accordingly it
is found to have none; but is furnished with two feelers, which, like the
crutch of a blind man, serve to direct its motions. Such is the form of this
animal, that lives for years in the worm state under ground, still
voracious, and every year changing its skin.</P>
<P>It is not till the end of the fourth year, that this
extraordinary insect prepares to emerge from its subterraneous abode, and
even this is not effected, but by a tedious preparation. <PB N="133" REF="131"/>
About the latter end of autumn, the grub be∣gins to perceive the approaches of
its transfor∣mation, it then buries itself deeper and deeper in the earth,
sometimes six feet beneath the surface, and there forms itself a
capacious apartment, the walls of which it renders very smooth and shining,
by the excretions of its body. Its abode being thus formed, it begins soon
after, to shorten itself, to swell, and to burst its last skin, in
order to assume the form of a chrysalis. This, in the beginning, appears
of a yellowish colour, which heightens by de∣grees, till at last, it is
seen nearly red. Its exterior form plainly discovers all the vestiges of
the future winged insect, all the fore parts being distinctly seen; while
behind, the animal seems as if wrapped in swaddling cloaths.</P>
<P>The young may-bug continues in this state for about three
months longer, and it is not till the beginning of January, that the aurelia
divests itself of all its impediments, and be∣comes a winged insect,
completely formed. Yet still the animal is far from attaining its natural
strength, health, and appetite. It un∣dergoes a kind of infant imbecillity,
and unlike most other insects, that the instant they become flies are
arrived at their state of full perfection, the may-bug continues feeble and
sickly. <PB N="134" REF="132"/> Its colour is much brighter than in the
perfect animal, all its parts are soft, and its voracious nature seems for
a while, to have entirely for∣saken it. As the animal is very often found in
this state, it is supposed, by those unacquainted with its real
history, that the old ones, of the former season, have buried
themselves for the winter, in order to revisit the sun the ensuing
summer. But the fact is, the old one never survives the season but
dies, like all the other winged tribe of insects, from the severity of cold
in winter.</P>
<P>About the latter end of May, these insects, after having
lived for four years under ground, burst from the earth, when the first
mild even∣ing invites them abroad. They are at that time seen rising from
their long imprisonment, from living only upon roots, and imbibing only the
moisture of the earth, to visit the mildness of the summer air, to
chuse the sweetest vegetables for their banquet, and to drink the dew of
the evening. Wherever an attentive observer then walks abroad, he will see
them bursting up before him in his pathway, like ghosts on a theatre. He
will see every part of the earth, that had its surface beaten into
hardness, per∣forated by their egression. When the season is
favourable for them, they are seen by myriads <PB N="135" REF="133"/> buzzing
along, hitting against every object that intercepts their flight. The mid-day
sun, how∣ever, seems too powerful for their constitu∣tions; they then
lurk under the leaves and branches of some shady tree; but the willow
seems particularly, their most favourite food; there they lurk in
clusters, and seldom quit the tree till they have devoured all its
ver∣dure. In those seasons, which are favourable to their propagation,
they are seen in an even∣ing as thick as flakes of snow, and hitting
against every object with a sort of capricious blindness. Their duration,
however, is but short, as they never survive the season. They begin to
join shortly after they have been let loose from their prison, and when
the female is impregnated, the cautiously bores a hole in the ground, with an
instrument fitted for that purpose, which the is furnished with at the
tail, and there deposits her eggs, generally to the number of threescore.
If the season and the soil be adapted to their propagation, these
soon multiply as already described, and go through their noxious stages
of their contemp∣tible existence. This insect, however, in its worm
state, though prejudicial to man, makes one of the chief repasts of the
feathered tribe, and is generally the first nourishment with 
<PB N="136" REF="134"/> which they supply their young: Rooks, and hogs are
particularly fond of these worms, and de∣vour them in great numbers. The
inhabitants of the county of Norfolk, some time since, went into the
practice of destroying their rookeries, but in proportion, as they
destroyed one plague, they were pestered with greater; and these
insects multiplied in such an amazing abundance, as to destroy not only
the verdure of the fields, but even the roots of vegetables, not yet shot
forth. One farm in particular was so injured by them in the year 1751, that
the occupier was not able to pay his rent, and the landlord was not only
content to lose his income for that year, but also gave money for the
sup∣port of the farmer and his family. In Ireland they suffered so much
by these insects, that they came to a resolution of setting fire to a
wood, of some miles in extent, to prevent their mischievous
propagation.</P>
<P>Of all the beetle kind this is the most nume∣rous, and
therefore deserves the chief attention of history. The numerous varieties
of other kinds, might repay the curiosity of the diligent observer, but we
must be content in general to observe, that in the great out-lines of the
history, they resemble those of which we have just been giving a
description; like them, all <PB N="137" REF="135"/> other beetles are bred
from the egg, which is deposited in the ground, or sometimes, tho'
seldom, in the barks of trees, they change into a worm; they subsist in
that state by living up∣on the roots of vegetables, or the succulent parts
of the bark round them. They generally live a year at least before they
change into an aurelia; in that state they are, not entirely mo∣tionless,
nor intirely swaddled up without form.</P>
<P>It would be tedious and endless to give a description of
all, and yet it would be an un∣pardonable omission not to mention the
parti∣cularities of some beetles, which are singular rather from their
size, their manners, or their formation. That beetle which the Americans call
the tumble-dung, particularly demands our attention; it is all over of a
dusky black, rounder than those animals are generally found to be, and so
strong, tho' not much larger than the common black beetle, that if one of
them be put under a brass candlestick, it will cause it to move backwards
and forwards, as if it were by an invisible hand, to the admiration of
those who are not accustomed to the sight; but this strength is given
it for much more use∣ful purposes than those of exciting human
curi∣osity, for there is no creature more laborious, either in seeking
subsistence, or in providing a <PB N="138" REF="136"/> proper retreat for
its young. They are endow∣ed with sagacity to discover subsistence by
their excellent smelling, which directs them in flights to excrements just
fallen from man or beast, on which they instantly drop, and fall
unanimously to work in forming round balls or pellets there∣of, in the middle
of which they lay an egg. These pellets, in September, they convey three feet
deep in the earth, where they lye till the approach of spring, when the eggs
are hatched and burnt their nests, and the insects find their way out of
the earth. They assist each other with indefatigable industry, in
rolling these globular pellets to the place where they are to be buried. This
they are to perform with the tail foremost, by raising up their hinder
part, and shoving along the ball with their hind-feet. They are always
accompanied with other beetles of a larger size, and of a more elegant
structure and colour. The breast of this is covered with a shield of a
crimson co∣lour, and shining-like metal; the head is of the like colour,
mixed with green, and on the crown of the head stands a shining black horn,
bended backwards. These are called the kings of the beetles, but for what
reason is uncer∣tain, since they partake of the same dirty drud∣gery with
the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="137"/>The Elephant-beetle is the largest of
this kind hitherto known, and is found in South-America, particularly Guiana
and Surinam, as well as a∣bout the river Oroonoko. It is of a black co∣lour,
and the whole body is covered with a very hard shell, full as thick and as
strong as that of a small crab. Its length, from the hinder part to the
eyes, is almost four inches, and from the same part to the end of the
proboscis, or trunk, four inches and three quarters. The transverse
dia∣meter of the body is two inches and a quarter, and the breadth of each
elytron, or case for the wings, is an inch and three tenths. The an∣tennae or
feelers, are quite horny; for which reason the proboscis or trunk is
moveable at its insertion into the head, and seems to sup∣ply the place
of feelers. The horns are eight tenths of an inch long, and terminate in
points. The proboscis is an inch and a quarter long, and turns upwards,
making a crooked line, terminating in two horns, each of which is near a
quarter of an inch long; but they are not perforated at the end like the
proboscis of other insects. About four tenths of an inch above the head, or
that side next the body, is a prominence, or small horn, which if the
rest of the trunk were away, would cause this part to resemble the horn
of a rhinoceros. There is <PB N="140" REF="138"/> indeed a beetle so called,
but then the horns or trunk has no fork at, the end, though the lower horn
resembles this. The feet are all forked at the end, but not like lobsters
claws.</P>
<P>To this class we may also refer the glow-worm, that little
animal which makes such a distinguished figure in the descriptions of
our poets. No two insects can differ more than the male and female of this
species from each other. The male is in every respect a beetle, having
cases to its wings, and rising in the air at pleasure; the female, on the
contrary has none, but is entirely a creeping insect, and is obliged to wait
the approaches of her capri∣cious companion. The body of the female has eleven
joints, with a shield breast-plate, the shape of which is oval; the head
is placed over this, and is very small, and the three last joints of her
body are of a yellowish colour; but what distinguishes it from all other
animals, at least in this part of the world, is the shining light which it
emits by night, and which is supposed by force philosophers, to be an
emanation which she sends forth to allure the male to her com∣pany. Most
travellers who have gone through sandy countries, must well remember the
little shining sparks with which the ditches are stud∣ded on each side
of the road. If incited by <PB N="141" REF="139"/> curiosity to approach more
nearly, he will find the light sent forth by the glow-worm; if he should
keep the little animal for some time, its light continues to grow paler, and
at last ap∣pears totally extinct: The manner in which this light is produced
has hitherto continued inexplicable; it is probable the little animal is
supplied with some electrical powers, so that by rubbing the joints of
its body against each other, it thus supplies a stream of light which if
it allures the male, as we are told, serves for very useful purposes.</P>
<P>The cantharis is of the beetle kind, from whence come
cantharides, well known in the chops by the name of Spanish flies, and for
their use in blisters. They have feelers like bristles, flexible cases
to the wings, a breast pretty plain, and the sides of the belly wrink∣led.
Cantharides differ from each other in their size, shape, and colour,
those used in the shops also do the same. The largest in these
parts are about an inch long, and as much in cir∣cumference, but others are not
above three quarters of an inch. Some are of a pure azure colour, others of
pure gold, and others again, have a mixture of pure gold and azure colours; but
they are all very brilliant, and extremely beautiful. These insects, as is
well <PB N="142" REF="140"/> known, are of the greatest benefit to mankind,
making a part in many medicines conducive to human preservation. They are
chiefly natives of Spain, Italy, and Portugal; but they are to be met with
also about Paris in the summer time, upon the leaves of the ash, the
poplar, and the rose-trees, and also among wheat, and in meadows. It is
very certain, that these in∣sects are fond of ash leaves, insomuch that
they will sometimes strip one of these trees quite bare. Some affirm,
that these flies de∣light in sweet-smelling herbs, and it is very
certain, that they are fond of honey-suckles, liloc, and wild-cherry
shrubs; but some that have sought after them declare, they never could
find them on elder-trees, nut-trees, and among wheat. We are told, that the
country people expect the return of these insects every seven years. It
is very certain, that such a num∣ber of these insects have been seen
together in the air, that they appeared like swarms of bees; and that they
have so disagreeable a smell, that it may be perceived a great way off,
especially about sun-set, though they are not seen at that time. This
bad smell is a guide for those who make it their business to catch
them. When they are caught they dry them, after which they are so light, that
fifty will hardly weigh a <PB N="143" REF="141"/> dram. Those that gather
them, tie them in a bag, or a piece of linnen cloth, that has been well worn,
and then they kill them with the vapours of hot vinegar; after which they dry
them in the sun, and keep them in boxes. These flies, thus dried, being
chymically ana∣lysed, yield a great deal of volatile caustic-salt, mixed
with a little oil, phlegm and earth. Cantharides are penetrating, corrosive,
and ap∣plied to the skin, raise blisters, from whence proceeds a great
deal of serosity. They are made use of both inwardly and outwardly.
However it is somewhat strange that the effects of these flies should
fall principally upon the urinary passages, for though some authors have
endeavoured to account for this, we are mill in the dark, for all they have
said amounts to no more, than that they affect these parts in a manner
which may be very learnedly described, but very obscurely comprehended.</P>
<P>An insect of great, tho' perhaps not equal use in medicine,
is that which is known by the name of the kermes; it is produced in the
ex∣crescence of an oak, called the berry-bearing ilex, and appears at first
wrapt up in a membranaceous bladder, of the size of a pea, smooth and
shining of a brownish red colour, and covered with a very fine
ash-coloured pow∣der. <PB N="144" REF="142"/> This bag teems with a number of
reddish eggs or insects, which being rubbed with the fingers pour out a
crimson liquor. It is only met with in warm countries in the months of May
and June. In the month of April this insect becomes of the size and shape
of a pea, and its eggs some time after burst from the womb, and soon
turning worms, run about the branches and leaves of the tree. They are of two
sexes, and the females have been hitherto described; but the males are very
distinct from the former, and are a sort of small flies like gnats, with
six feet, of which the four forward are short, and the two backward long,
divided into four joints, and armed with three crooked nails. There are two
feelers on the head, a line and a half long, which are moveable, streaked and
articulated. The tail, at the back part of the body, is half a line long, and
forked. The whole body is covered with two transparent wings, and they leap
about in the manner of fleas. The har∣vest of the kermes is greater or less
in propor∣tion to the severity of the winter, and the wo∣men gather them
before sun-rising, tearing them off with their nails; for fear there
should be any loss from the hatching of the insects. They sprinkle them
with vinegar, and lay them in the sun to dry, where they acquire a red
colour.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="143"/>An insect, perhaps, still more
useful than, either of the former, is the cochineal, which has been very
variously described by authors; some have supposed it a vegetable
excrescence from the tree upon which it is found; some have described it
as a louse, some as a bug, and some as a beetle. As they appear in our
shops when brought from America, they are of an irre∣gular shape, convex on
one side, and a little concave on the other; but are both marked with
transverse streaks or wrinkles. They are of a scarlet colour within,
and without of a blackish red, and sometimes of a white, reddish, or
ash-colour, which are accounted the best, and are brought to us from
Mexico. The cochineal insect is of an oval form, of the size of a small
pea, with six feet, and a snout or trunk. It brings forth its young alive,
and is nourished by sucking the juice of the plant. Its body consists
of several rings, and when it is once fixed on the plant, it continues
immove∣able, being subject to no change. Some pre∣tend there are two sorts,
the one domestic, which is best, and the other wild, that is of a vivid
colour; however they appear to be the same, only with this difference, that
the Wild feeds upon uncultivated trees, without any assis∣tance, whereas
the domestic is carefully at a <PB N="146" REF="144"/> stated season,
removed to cultivated trees, where it feeds upon a purer juice. Those who
take care of these insects, place them on the prickly pear plant in a
certain order, and are very industrious in defending them from other
insects; for if any other kind come among them, they take care to brush
them off with foxes tails. Towards the end of the year, when the rains and cold
weather are coming on, which are fatal to these insects, they take off the
leaves or branches covered with cochineal, that have not attained their
utmost degree of perfection, and keep them in their houses till winter is
past. These leaves are very thick and juicy, and supply them with
sufficient nourish∣ment, while they remain within doors. When the milder
weather returns, and these animals are about to exclude their young, the
natives make them nests, like those of birds, but less, of tree-moss,
or soft hay, or the down of co∣coa-nuts, placing twelve in every nest.
These they fix on the thorns of the prickly pear-plant, and in three or four
days time they bring forth their young, which leave their nests in a few
days, and creep upon the branches of the plant, till they find a proper place
to rest in, and take in their nourishment; and until the fe∣males are
secundated by the males, which, as <PB N="147" REF="145"/> in the former
tribe, differ very widely, from the females being winged insects, whereas the
others only creep, and are at most stationary. When they are impregnated,
they produce a new offspring, so that the propagator has a new harvest thrice
a year. When the native Americans have gathered the cochineal, they put them
into holes in the ground, where they kill them with boiling water, and
afterwards dry them in the sun, or in an oven, or lay them upon hot plates.
From the various me∣thods of killing them, arise the different co∣lours which
they appear in when brought to us. While they are living, they seem to be
sprinkled over with a white powder, which they lose as soon as the
boiling water is poured upon them. Those that are dried upon hot places are
the blackest. What we call the co∣chineal are only the females, for the males
are a sort of fly as already observed in the kermes. They are used both
for dyeing and medicine, and are said to have much the same virtue as the
ker∣mes, tho' they are now seldom used alone, but are mixed with other
things for the sake of the colour.</P>
<P>I shall end this account of the beetle tribe with the history
of an animal which cannot pro∣perly be ranked under this species, and yet
which cannot be more methodically ranged under <PB N="148" REF="146"/> any
other. This is the insect that forms and resides in the gall-nut, the
spoils of which are converted to such useful purposes. The gall
insects are bred in a sort of bodies adhering to a kind of oak in Asia,
which differ with regard to their colour, size, roughness, smoothness
and shape, and which we call galls. They are not fruit, as some have
imagined, but preternatural tumours, owing to the wounds given to the buds,
leaves, and twigs of the tree, by a kind of insects that lay their eggs
within them. This animal is furnished with an implement, by which the female
penetrates into the bark of the tree, or into that spot which just begins
to bud, and there sheds a drop of corrosive fluid into the cavity. Having
thus formed a recepta∣cle for her eggs, she deposites them in the place,
and dies soon after. The heart of the bud be∣ing thus wounded, the
circulation of the nu∣tritive juice is interrupted and the fermentation
thereof, with the poison injected by the fly, burns the parts adjacent, and
then alters the natural colour of the plant. The juice or sap turned bark
from its natural course, extravasates and flows round the egg. After which
it swells and dilates by the assistance of some bubbles of air, which
get admission through the pores of the bark, and which run in the
vessels with the sap. <PB N="149" REF="147"/> The external coat of this
excrescence is dried by the air, and grows into a figure which bears some
resemblance to the bow of an arch, or the roundness of a kernel. This
little ball receives its nutriment, growth and vegetation as the other parts of
the tree by slow degrees, and is what we call the gall-nut. The worm that is
hatched un∣der this spacious vault, finds in the substance of the ball,
which is as yet very tender, a subsistence suitable to its nature;
gnaws and digests it till the time comes for its transformation to a nymph,
and from that state of existence changes into a fly. After this the
insect, perceiving it∣self duly provided with all things requisite,
dis∣engages itself soon from its confinement, and takes its flight into
the open air. The case how∣ever, is not similar with respect to the
gall-nut, that grows in autumn. The cold weather fre∣quently comes on before
the worm is transform∣ed into a fly, or before the fly can pierce through its
inclosure. The nut falls with the leaves, and altho' you may imagine that the
fly which lies within is lost, yet in reality it is not so; on the
contrary, its being covered up so close, is the means of its
preservation. Thus it spends the winter in a warm house, where every
crack and cranny of the nut is well stopped up; and lies buried as it were
under a heap of leaves, <PB N="150" REF="148"/> which preserves it from the
injuries of the weather. This apartment, however, tho' so commodious a
retreat in the winter, is a per∣fect prison in the spring. The fly, rouzed
out of its lethargy by the first heats, breaks its way through, and ranges
where it pleases. A very small aperture is sufficient since at this
time the fly is but a diminutive crea∣ture. Besides, the ringlets whereof its
body is composed, dilate, and become pliant is the passage.</P>

<PB N="151" REF="149"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Gnat and the Tipula.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two insects which entirely re∣semble each other in
their form, and yet widely differ in their habits, manners and propaga∣tion.
Those who have seen the tipula, or long-legs, and the larger kind of gnat,
have most probably mistaken the one for the other, they have often
accused the tipula, a harmless insect, of depredations made by the gnat,
and the innocent have suffered for the guilty; in∣deed the differences in
their form are so very minute, that it often requires the assistance of
a microscope to distinguish the one from the other: they are both mounted
on long legs, both furnished with two wings and a slender body; their heads
are large, and they seem to be hump-backed; the chief and only difference,
therefore, is, that the tipula wants a trunk, while the gnat has a large one,
which it often exerts to very mischievous purposes. The tipula is a
harmless peaceful insect, that offers injury to nothing; the gnat is
sanguinary and <PB N="152" REF="150"/> predaceous, ever seeking out for a
place in which to bury its trunk, and pumping up the blood from the animal in
large quantities.</P>
<P>The gnat proceeds from a little worm, which is usually seen
at the bottom of standing waters. The manner in which the insect lays its
eggs is particularly curious; after having laid the pro∣per number on the
surface of the water, it sur∣rounds them with a kind of unctuous matter,
which prevents them from sinking; but at the same time fastens them with
a thread to the bottom, to prevent their floating away, at the mercy of every
breeze, from a place the warmth of which is proper for their production, to any
other, where the water may be too cold, or the animals its enemies too
numerous. Thus the insects, in their egg state, resemble a buoy, which is
fixed by an anchor. As they come to maturity they sink deeper, and at last,
when they leave the egg as worms they creep at the bottom. They now make
themselves lodg∣ments of cement, which they fasten to some solid body
at the very bottom of the water, unless, by accident, they meet with a piece
of chalk, which being of a soft and pliant nature, gives them an opportunity
of sinking a retreat for themselves, where nothing but the claws of a
cray-fish can possibly molest them. The worm <PB N="153" REF="151"/>
afterwards changes its form. It appears with a large head, and a tail
invested with hair, and moistened with an oleaginous liquor, which she
makes use of as a cork, to sustain her head in the air, and her tail in
the water, and to tran∣sport her from one place to another. When the oil with
which her tail is moistened begins to grow dry, she discharges out of her
mouth an unctuous humour, which she sheds all over her tail, by virtue
whereof, she is enabled to-transport herself where she pleases,
without be∣ing either wet or any ways incommoded by the water. The gnat, in her
second state, is pro∣perly speaking, in her form of a nymph, which is an
introduction, or entrance into a new life. In the first place, the diverts
herself of her se∣cond skin; in the next she resigns her eyes, her
antennae, and her tail; in short, she actually seems to expire. However,
from the spoils of the amphibious animal, a little winged insect cuts the
air, whose every part is active to the last de∣gree, and whose whole
structure is the just ob∣ject of our admiration. Its little head is
adorn∣ed with a plume of feathers, and its whole body invested with scales
and hair, to secure it from any wet or dust. She makes trial of the
activity of her wings, by rubbing them either against her body, or her broad
side-bags, <PB N="154" REF="152"/> which keep her in an equilibrium. The
fur∣below, or little border of fine feathers, which graces her wings is very
curious, and strikes the eye in the most agreeable manner. There is
nothing, however, of greater importance to the gnat, than her trunk, and that
weak imple∣ment may justly be deemed one of nature's master-pieces. It is
so very small, that the extremity of it can scarcely be discerned
through the best microscope that can be procured. That part which is at
first obvious to the eye, is nothing but a long scaly sheath under the
throat. At near the distance of two thirds of it, there is an aperture,
through which the in∣sect darts out four stings, and afterwards retracts
them. One of which, however sharp and ac∣tive it may be, is no more than the
case in which the other three lie concealed, and run in a long groove. The
sides of these stings are sharpened like two-edged swords; they are
likewise barbed, and have a vast number of cutting teeth towards the point,
which turns up like a hook, and is fine beyond expression. When all these
darts are stuck into the flesh of animals, sometimes one after another,
and sometimes all at once, the blood and humours of the adjacent parts must
unavoidably be ex∣travasated; upon which a tumour must conse∣quently 
<PB N="155" REF="153"/> ensue, the little orifice whereof is closed up by
the compression of the external air. When the gnat, by the point of her
case, which she makes use of as a tongue, has tasted any fruit,
flesh, or juice, that she has found out; if it be a fluid, she sucks it
up, without play∣ing her darts into it; but in case she finds the least
obstruction by any flesh whatever, she ex∣erts her strength, and
pierces through it, if possibly she can. After this she draws back her
stings into their sheath, which she applies to the wound in order to
extract, as through a reed, the juices which she finds inclosed. This is
the implement with which the gnat performs her work in the summer, for during
the winter the has no manner of occasion for it. Then she ceases to eat,
and spends all that tedious season either in quarries or in caverns,
which she abandons at the return of summer, and flies about in search
after some commodious ford, or standing water, where she may produce her
progeny, which would be soon washed a∣way and lost, by the too rapid
motion of any running stream. The little brood are some∣times so
numerous, that the very water is tin∣ged according to the colour of the
species, as green, if they be green, and of a sanguine hue, if they be
red.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="154"/>These are circumstances sufficiently
extraor∣dinary in the life of this little animal, but it offers something
still more curious in the me∣thod of its propagation. However similar
in∣sects of the gnat kind are in their appearance, yet they differ widely
from each other in the manner in which they are brought forth, for some are
ovi∣parous, and are produced from eggs, some are viviparous, and come forth
in their most per∣fect form; some are males, and unite with the female;
some are females, requiring the im∣pregnation of the male; some are of
neither sex, yet still produce young, without any copu∣lation whatsoever.
This is one of the strangest discoveries in all natural history! A gnat
se∣parated from the rest of its kind, and inclosed in a glass
vessel, with air sufficient to keep it alive, shall produce young,
which also, when separated from each other, shall be the parents of a
numerous progeny. Thus, down for five or six generations do these
extraordinary animals propagate without the use of copulation, with∣out any
congress between the male and female, but in the manner of vegetables, the
young bursting from the body of their parents, without any previous
impregnation. At the sixth genera∣tion however, their propagation stops,
the gnat no longer produces its like, from itself <PB N="157" REF="155"/>
alone, but it requires the access of the male to give it another
succession of secundity.</P>
<P>The gnat of Europe gives but little uneasi∣ness; it is
sometimes heard to hum about our beds at night, and keeps off the approaches
of sleep by the apprehension it causes; but it is very different in the
ill-peopled regions of America, where the waters stagnate, and the climate is
warm, and where they are produced in multitudes beyond expression. The
whole air is there filled with clouds of those famished insects; and they
are found of all sizes, from six inches long, to a minuteness that even
re∣quires the microscope to have a distinct percep∣tion of them. The warmth
of the mid-day sun is too powerful for their constitutions; but when the
evening approaches, neither art nor flight can shield the wretched
inhabitants from their at∣tacks, tho' millions are destroyed, still
millions more succeed, and produce unceasing torment. The native Indians,
who anoint their bodies with oil, and who have from their infancy been used
to their depredations, find them much less inconvenient than those who are
newly ar∣rived from Europe; they sleep in their cot∣tages covered all over
with thousands of the gnat kind upon their bodies, and yet do not seem to
have their slumbers interrupted by <PB N="158" REF="156"/> their cruel
devourers. If a candle happens to be lighted in one of those places, a cloud
of insects at once light upon the flame, and extinguish it; they are
therefore obliged to keep their candles in glass lanthorns; a mi∣serable
expedient to prevent an unceasing calamity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Zoophytes in General.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to the last link in the chain of animated
nature, to a class of beings so confined in their powers, and so
defective in their formation, that some historians have been at a loss
whether to consider them as a superior rank of vegetables, or the
humblest order of the animated tribe. In order therefore to give them a
denomination, agreeable to their existence, they have been called Zoophytes,
a name implying vegetable nature indued with animal life; and indeed, in some
the marks of the animal are so few, that it is difficult to give their place
in nature with precision, or to tell whether it is a plant or an insect
that is the object of our consideration.</P>
<P>Should it be asked what it is that constitutes the
difference between animal and vegetable life, what it is that lays the line
that separates those two great kingdoms from each other, it would be
difficult, perhaps we should find it impossible, to return an answer.
The power of motion cannot form this distinction, since some vegetables
are possest of motion, and <PB N="162" REF="159"/> many animals are
totally without it. The sen∣sitive plant has obviously a greater variety
of motions than the oyster or the pholas. The animal that fills the
acorn-shell is immoveable, and can only close its lid to defend itself
from external injury, while the flower, which goes by the name of the fly-trap,
seems to close upon the flies that light upon it, and that attempt to rifle
it of its honey. The animal in this instance, seems to have scarce a
power of self defence; the ve∣getable not only guards its
possessions, but seizes upon the robber that would venture to invade
them. In like manner, the methods of propaga∣tion give no superiority to the
lower rank of ani∣mals. On the contrary, vegetables are frequently produced
more conformably to the higher ranks of the creation, and though some plants
are pro∣duced by cuttings from others, yet the general manner of propagation is
from seeds, laid in the womb of the earth, where they are hatched into the
similitude of the parent plant or flower. But a most numerous tribe of
animals have lately been discovered, which are propagated by cuttings, and
this in so extraordinary a manner, that, though the original insect be
divided into a thousand parts, each, however small, shall be formed into
an animal, entirely resembling that which was at first divided; in this
respect, <PB N="163" REF="160"/> therefore, certain races of animals seem to
fall beneath vegetables, by their more imperfect propagation.</P>
<P>What, therefore, is the distinction between them, or are the
orders so intimately blended as that it is impossible to mark the
boundaries of each? To me it would seem, that all animals are
possessed of one power, of which vegetables are totally deficient; I
mean either the actual ability, or an aukward attempt at
self-preser∣vation. However vegetables may seem possessed of this
important quality, yet it is with them but a mechanical impulse, resembling
the rais∣ing one end of the lever, when you depress the other: the
sensitive plant contracts and hangs its leaves, indeed, when touched, but
this mo∣tion no way contributes to its safety; the fly-trap flower acts
entirely in the same manner; and though it seems to seize the little
animal, that comes to annoy it, yet, in reality, only closes mechanically
upon it, and this inclosure neither contributes to its preservation nor its
defence. But it is very different with insects, even of the lowest order;
the earth-worm not only contracts, but hides itself in the earth, and
escapes with force share of swiftness from its pursuers. The polypus
hides its horns; the star-fish contracts its arms, upon the ap∣pearance 
<PB N="164" REF="161"/> even of distant dangers; they not only hunt for their
food, but provide for their safety, and however imperfectly they may be
formed, yet still they are in reality, placed many degrees above the
highest vegetable of the earth, and are possessed of many animal
functions, as well as those that are more elaborately formed.</P>
<P>But though these be superior to plants, they are very far
beneath their animated fellows of existence. In the class of zoophytes, we
may place all those animals, which may be propa∣gated by cuttings, or in
other words, which, if divided into two or more parts, each part in time,
becomes a separate and perfect animal; the head shoots forth a tail, and on
the contrary, the tail produces a head; some of these will bear dividing,
but into two parts, such is the earth-worm; some may be divided into more
than two, and of this kind are many of the star fish; others still may be
cut into a thousand parts, each becoming a per∣fect animal; they may be
turned inside out, like the finger of a glove, they may be mould∣ed into all
manner of shapes, yet still their vivacious principle remains, still
every single part becomes perfect in its kind, and after a few days
existence, exhibits all the arts and in∣dustry <PB N="165" REF="162"/> of
its contemptible parent! We shall, therefore, divide zoophytes according to
their several degrees of perfection, namely, into worms, star-fish and
polypi; contenting our∣selves with a short review of those nauseous and
despicable creatures, that excite our curiosity chiefly by their
imperfections; it must not be concealed, however, that much has of late been
written on this part of natural history. A new mode of animal production,
could not fail of exciting not only the curiosity, but the asto∣nishment
of every philosopher; many found their favourite systems totally
overthrown by the dis∣covery, and it was not without a wordy struggle, that
they gave up what had formerly been their pleasure and their pride. At
last, however, con∣viction became too strong for argument, and a
question, which owed its general spread rather to its novelty, than to its
importance, was given up in favour of the new discovery.</P>

<PB N="166" REF="163"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Worms.</HEAD>
<P>THE first in the class of zoophytes, are animals of the worm
kind, which being entirely destitute of feet, trail themselves along upon
the ground, and find themselves a retreat under the earth, or in the water.
As these, like ser∣pents, have a creeping motion, so both, in general, go
under the common appellation of reptiles; a loathsome, noxious, malignant
tribe, to which man by nature, as well as by religion, has the strongest
antipathy. But though worms, as well as serpents, are mostly without feet,
and have been doomed to creep along the earth on their bellies, yet their
motions are very different. The serpent, as has been said before, having a
back bone, which it is incapable of contract∣ing, bends its body into the form
of a bow, and then shoots forward from the tail; but it is very different
with the worm, which has a power of contracting or lengthening itself at
will. There is a spiral muscle, that runs round its whole body, from the
head to tail, somewhat resembling a wire wound round a walking-cane, 
<PB N="167" REF="164"/> which, when slipped off, and one end extended and held
fast, will bring the other nearer to it; in this manner the earth-worm,
having shot out, or extended its body, takes hold by the slime of the fore
part of its body, and so contracts and brings forward the hinder part; in
this manner it moves onward, not without great effort, but the occasions for
its progressive motion are few.</P>
<P>As it is designed for living under the earth, and leading a
life of obscurity, so it seems toler∣ably adapted to its situation. Its
body is armed with small stiff sharp burrs or prickles, which it can
erect or depress at pleasure; under the skin there lies a slimy juice,
to be ejected as oc∣casion requires, at certain perforations, between the
rings of the musces, to lubricate its body, and facilitate its passage
into the earth. Like most other insects, it hath breathing-holes along the
back, adjoining each ring; but it is without bones, without eyes, without ears,
and, properly without feet. It has a mouth, and also an elemen∣tary canal,
which runs along to the very point of the tail. In some worms, however,
particular∣ly such as are found in the bodies of animals, this canal opens
towards the middle of the belly, at some distance from the tail. The
in∣testines of the earth-worm, are always found <PB N="168" REF="165"/> filled
with a very fine earth, which seems to be the only nourishment these
animals are capable of receiving.</P>
<P>The animal is entirely without brain, but near the head is
placed the heart, which is seen to beat with a very distinct motion, and
round it are the spermatic vessels, forming a number of little globules,
containing a milky fluid, which have an opening into the belly, not far from
the head: they are also often found to contain a number of eggs, which are
laid in the earth, and are hatched in twelve or four∣teen days into life, by
the genial warmth of their situation; like snails, all these animals
unite in themselves, both sexes at once, the reptile that impregnates,
being impregnated in turn; few that walk out, but must have ob∣served them,
with their heads laid against each other, and so strongly attached, that
they suffer themselves to be trod upon.</P>
<P>When the eggs are laid in the earth, which, in about fourteen
days, as has been said, are hatched into maturity, the young ones come forth
very small, but perfectly formed, and suffer no change during their
ex∣istence: how long their life continues is not well known, but it certainly
holds for more than two or three seasons. During the winter, 
<PB N="169" REF="166"/> they bury themselves deeper in the earth, and seem,
in some measure, to share the general torpidity of the insect tribe. In
spring, they revive with the rest of nature, and on those oc∣casions, a
moist or dewy evening brings them forth from their retreats, for the
universal pur∣pose of continuing their kind. They chiefly live in a light
rich and fertile soil, moistened by dews or accidental showers, but avoid
those places where the water is apt to lie on the sur∣face of the earth, or
where the clay is too stiff for their easy progression under
ground.</P>
<P>Helpless as they are formed, yet they seem very vigilant in
avoiding those animals that chiefly make them their prey; in particular, the
mole, who feeds entirely upon them be∣neath the surface, and who seldom
ventures, from the dimness of its sight, into the open air; him they avoid,
by darting up from the earth, the instant they feel the ground move; and
fishermen, who are well acquainted with this, take them in what numbers they
chuse, by stirring the earth where they expect to find them. They are
also driven from their retreats under ground, by pouring bitter or acrid
water thereon, such as that water in which green walnuts have been steeped,
or a lye made of pot-ashes.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="167"/>Such is the general outline of the
history of these reptiles, which, as it should seem, degrades them no
way beneath the rank of other animals of the insect creation; but we now come
to a part of their history, which proves the imperfection of their organs,
from the easiness with which these little machines may be damaged and
re∣paired again. It is well known in mechanics, that the finest and most
complicated instruments are the most easily put out of order, and the
most difficultly set right; the same also obtains in the animal
machine. Man, the most com∣plicated machine of all others, whose nerves are
more numerous, and powers of action more various, is most easily
destroyed: he is seen to die under wounds which a quadruped or a bird could
easily survive; and as we descend gradu∣ally to the lower ranks, the
ruder the composi∣tion, the more difficult it is to disarange it. Some
animals live without their limbs, and of∣ten are seen to reproduce them;
some are seen to live without their brain for many weeks to∣gether;
caterpillars continue to increase and grow large, tho' all their nobler
organs are in∣tirely destroyed within; some animals continue to exist,
though cut in two, their nobler parts pre∣serving life, while the others
perish that were cut away; but the earth worm, and all the 
<PB N="171" REF="168"/> zoophyte tribe, continue to live in separate parts,
and one animal, by the means of cut∣ting, is divided into two distinct
existences, sometimes into a thousand.</P>
<P>There is no phaenomenon in all natural histo∣ry more
astonishing than this, that man, at plea∣sure, should have a kind of
creative power, and out of one life make two, each compleatly formed, with all
its apparatus and functions, each with its perceptions, and powers of motion
and self-preservation, each as compleat in all respects as that from
which it derived its exist∣ence, and equally enjoying the humble
grati∣fications of its nature.</P>
<P>When De Cartes first started the opinion, that brutes were
machines, the discovery of this surprising propagation was unknown, which
might, in some measure, have strengthened his fanciful theory. What is
life, in brutes, he might have said, or where does it reside? In some we
find it so diffused, that every part seems to maintain a vivacious
principle, and the same animal appears possessed of a thousand
distinct irrational souls at the same time. But let us not, he would
say, give so noble a name to such contemptible powers, but rank the
vivi∣fying principle in these with the sap that rises in vegetables, or
the moisture that contracts a <PB N="172" REF="169"/> cord, or the heat that
puts water into motion! Nothing, in fact, deserves the name of soul, but
that which reasons, that which understands, and by knowing God, receives
the mark of its currency, and is minted with the impression of its great
Creator.</P>
<P>Sucb might have been the speculations of this philosopher,
however to leave theory, it will be sufficient to say that we owe the
first discovery of this power of reproduction in animals to Mr. Trembley,
who first observed it in the polypus, and after him, Spalanzani and others
found it taking place in the earth-worm, the sea-worm, and several other
ill-formed animals of a like kind, which were susceptible of this new mode
of propagation. This last philosopher, has tried several experiments upon
the earth-worm, many of which succeeded according to his expectation; every
earth-worm, however, did not retain the vivacious principle with the same
obstinacy; some, when cut in two, were intirely destroyed; others
survived only in the nobler part; and while the head was living the tail
entirely pe∣rished, and a new one was seen to burge on from the extremity.
But what was most sur∣prising of all, in some, particularly in the
small red-headed earth worm, both extremities survived the operation; the
head produced a <PB N="173" REF="170"/> tail with the anus, the intestines,
the anular muscles, and the prickly beards; the tail part, on the other hand,
was seen to shoot forth the nobler organs, and in less than the space
of three months sent forth a head, heart, with all the apparatus and
instruments of gene∣ration. This part, as may easily be supposed, was
produced much more slowly than the for∣mer, a new head taking above three or
four months for its completion, a new tail being shot forth in less than as
many weeks. Thus two animals, by dissection, were made out of one, each
with their separate appetites, each endued with life and motion, and
seemingly as perfect as that single animal from whence they derived their
origin.</P>
<P>What was performed upon the earth-worm, was found to obtain
also in many other of the vermicular species. The sea-worm, the white
water-worm, and many of those little worms with feelers, found at the bottom
of dirty ditches; in all these the nobler organs are of such little use,
that if taken away, the ani∣mal does not seem to feel the want of them; it
lives in all its parts, and in every part, and by a strange paradox in
nature, the most useless and contemptible life is of all others the
most difficult to destroy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Star-fish.</HEAD>
<P>THE next order of zoophytes is that of the star fish, a
numerous tribe, shapeless and de∣formed, assuming at different times
different appearances. The same animal that now appears round like a ball,
shortly after flattens as thin as a plate. All of this kind are formed of a
se∣mi-transparent gelatinous substance, covered with a thin membrane,
and, to an inattentive spectator, often appear like a lump of inani∣mate
jelly, floating at random upon the surface of the sea, or thrown by chance
on shore at the departure of the tide. But upon a more minute inspection,
they will be found possessed of life and motion; they will be found to
shoot forth their arms in every direction, in order to seize upon such
insects as are near, and to devour them with great rapacity. Worms, the
spawn of fish, and even muscles themselves, with their hard
resisting shell, have been found in the sto∣machs of these voracious
animals; and what is very extraordinary, tho' the substance of their own
bodies be almost as soft as water, yet they are no way injured by
swallowing <PB REF="172"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="175" REF="173"/> these shells, which are
almost of a stony hardness. They increase in size as all other
ani∣mals do. In summer, when the water of the sea is warmed by the heat of
the sun, they float upon the surface, and in the dark they send forth a
kind of shining light resembling that of phosphorus. Some have given
these animals the name of sea-nettles, because they burn the hands of
those that touch them, as nettles are found to do. They are often seen
fastened to the rocks, and to the largest sea-shells, as if to de∣rive
their nourishment from them. If they be taken and put into spirit of wine,
they will con∣tinue for many years intire, but if they be left to the influence
of the air, they are, in less than four and twenty hours melted down into a
limpid and offensive water.</P>
<P>In all of this species, none are found to pos∣sess a
vent for their excrements, but the same passage by which they devour
their food, serves for the ejection of their faeces. These animals as was
said, take such a variety of figures, that it is impossible to
describe them under one deter∣minate shape; but in general, their bodies
re∣semble a truncated cone, whose base is applied to the rock to which
they are found usually attached. Tho' generally transparent, yet they are
found of different colours, some inclining to <PB N="176" REF="174"/> green,
some to red, some to white, and some to brown. In some, their colours
appear dif∣fused over the whole surface, in some, they are often
streaked, and in others often spotted. They are possest of a very
slow progressive mo∣tion, and in fine weather, they are continually
seen, stretching out and fishing for their prey. Many of them are
possest of a number of long slender filaments, in which they entangle
any small animals they happen to approach, and thus draw them into their
enormous stomachs, which fill the whole cavity of their bodies. The harder
shells continue for some weeks in∣digested, but at length, they undergo a
kind of maceration in the stomach, and become a part of the substance of
the animal itself. The indigestible parts, are returned by the same
aperture by which they were swallowed, and then the star-fish begins to
fish for more. These also may be cut in pieces, and every part will
survive the operation; each becoming a perfect animal, endued with its
natural rapacity. Of this tribe, the num∣ber is various, and the description
of each would be tedious and uninstructing; the man∣ners and nature of all,
are nearly as described; but I will just make mention of one creature,
which, tho' not properly belonging to this class, <PB N="177" REF="175"/> yet
is so nearly related, that the passing it in silence would be an
unpardonable omission.</P>
<P>Of all other animals, the cuttle-fish, tho' in some
respect superior to this tribe, possesses qualities the most
extraordinary. It is about two feet long, covered with a very thin skin, and
its flesh composed of a gelatinous substance, which however within
side is strengthened by a strong bone, of which such great use is
made by the goldsmiths. It is possessed of eight arms, which it
extends, and which are proba∣bly of service to it in fishing for its prey;
while in life, it is capable of lengthening or contract∣ing these at
pleasure; but when dead, they con∣tract and lose their rigidity. They feed
upon small fish, which they seize with their arms; and they are bred from
eggs, which are laid upon the weeds along the sea-shore.</P>
<P>The cuttle fish is found along many of the coasts of Europe,
but are not easily caught, from a contrivance with which they are
furnish∣ed by nature; this is a black substance, of the colour of ink,
which is contained in a bladder generally on the left-side of the belly, and
which is ejected in the manner of an excrement from the anus. Whenever
therefore this fish is pur∣sued, and when it finds a difficulty of
escaping, it spurts forth a great quantity of this black 
<PB N="178" REF="176"/> liquor, by which the waters are totally darken∣ed, and
then it escapes, by lying close at the bottom. In this manner the creature
finds its safety, and men find ample cause for admira∣tion, from the great
variety of stratagems with which creatures are endued for their peculiar
preservation.</P>

<PB N="179" REF="177"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Polypus.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE animals which we have described in the last chapter,
are variously denominated. They have been called the Star-fish,
Sea-net∣tles, and Sea-polypi. This last name has been peculiarly ascribed
to them by the ancients, because of the number of feelers or feet of which
they are all possest, and with which they have a slow progressive
motion; but the mo∣derns have given the name of Polypus, to a reptile that
lives in fresh water, by no means so large or observable. These are
found at the bottom of wet ditches, or attached to the un∣der surface of the
broad-leafed plants that grow and swim on the waters. The same difference
holds between these and the sea-water polypus, as between all the
productions of the sea, and of the land and the ocean. The marine vegetables
and animals grow to a monstrous size. The eel, the pike, or the bream of
fresh-waters, is but small; but in the sea, they grow to an enormous
magnitude. The herbs of the field are at most but a few feet high; those of
the sea often shoot forth a stalk of a hundred. It is so between the
polypi of <PB N="180" REF="178"/> both elements. Those of the sea are found
from two feet in length to three or four, and Pliny has even described one,
the arms of which were no less than thirty feet long. Those in fresh
waters, however, are comparatively minute; at their utmost size, seldom
above three parts of an inch long, and when gathered up into their usual
form, not above a third even of those dimensions.</P>
<P>It was upon these minute animals, that the power of
dissection was first tried in multiply∣ing their numbers. They had been
long con∣sidered as little worthy the attention of observ∣ers, and were
consigned to that neglect in which thousands of minute species of
insects remain to this very day. It is true, indeed, that Reau∣mur
observed, classed, and named them. By contemplating their motions, he was
enabled di∣stinctly to pronounce on their being of the animal, and not of the
vegetable kingdom; and he call∣ed them Polypi, from their great resemblance
to those larger ones that were found in the ocean. Still, however, their
properties were neglected, and their history unknown.</P>
<P>Mr. Trembley was the person to whom we owe the first
discovery of the amazing properties and powers of this little vivacious
creature: He divided this class of animals into four different 
<PB N="181" REF="179"/> kinds; into those inclining to green, those of a
brownish cast, those of flesh-colour, those which he calls the polype
dé panache. The differences of structure in these, as also of
co∣lour, are observable enough; but the manner of their subsisting, of
seizing their prey, and of their propagation, is pretty nearly the same in
all.</P>
<P>Whoever has looked with care into the bot∣tom of a wet ditch,
when the water is stagnant, and the sun has been powerful, may remember to
have seen many little transparent lumps of jelly, about the size of a
pea, and flatted on one side; such also as have examined the un∣der
side of the broad-leafed weeds that grow on the surface of the water,
must have observed them studded with a number of these little
jelly-like substances, which were probably then dis∣regarded, because
their nature and history was unknown. These little substances however,
were no other than living polypi gathered up into a quiescent state and
seemingly inanimate, because either disturbed, or not excited by the
calls of appetite to action. When they are seen exert∣ing themselves they
put on a very different appearance from that when at rest; to conceive a
just idea of their figure, we may suppose the finger of a glove cut off
at the bottom; we may <PB N="182" REF="180"/> suppose also several
threads or horns plant∣ed round the edge like a fringe. The hollow of this
finger will give us an idea of the stomach of the animal, the threads
issuing forth from the edges may be considered as the arms or feelers,
with which it hunts for its prey. The animal, at its greatest extent, is
seldom seen above an inch and a half long, but it is much shorter when it
is contracted and at rest; it is furnished neither with muscles nor
rings, and its manner of length∣ening or contracting itself, more resembles
that of the snail, than worms, or any other insect. The polypus contracts
itself more or less, in proportion as it is touched, or as the water is
agitated in which they are seen. Warmth ani∣mates them, and cold benumbs
them; but it requires a degree of cold approaching conge∣lation before they are
reduced to perfect in∣activity; those of an inch have generally their arms
double, often thrice as long as their bo∣dies. The arms, where the animal is
not disturb∣ed, and the season not unfavourable, are thrown about in
various directions, in order to seize and entangle its little prey;
sometimes three or four of the arms are thus employed, while the rest are
contracted like the horns of a snail, within the animal's body. It seems
capable of giving what length it pleases to these arms; it con∣tracts 
<PB N="183" REF="181"/> and extends them at pleasure, and stretches them
only in proportion to the remote∣ness of the object it would seize.</P>
<P>These animals have a progressive motion, which is
performed by that power they have of lengthening and contracting themselves
at plea∣sure; they go from one part of the bottom to another; they mount
along the margin of the water, and climb up the side of aquatic plants. They
often are seen to come to the surface of the water, where they suspend
themselves by their lower end. As they advance but very slowly, they employ
a great deal of time in every action, and bind themselves very strongly to
whatever body they chance to move upon as they proceed; their adhesion is
voluntary, and is probably performed in the manner of a cupping glass
ap∣plied to the body.</P>
<P>All animals of this kind have a remarkable attachment to turn
towards the light, and this naturally might induce an enquirer to look for
their eyes; but however carefully this search has been pursued, and however
excellent the microscope with which every part was examined yet nothing of
the appearance of this or∣gan was found over the whole body; and it is most
probable that, like several o∣ther insects which hunt their prey by their 
<PB N="184" REF="182"/> feeling, these creatures are unfurnished with
advantages which would be totally useless for their support.</P>
<P>In the center of the arms, as was said before, the mouth is
placed, which the animal can open and shut at pleasure, and this serves
at once as a passage for food, and an opening for it after digestion. The
inward part of the animal's body seems to be one great stomach, which is
open at both ends; but the purposes which the opening at the bottom serves
are hitherto un∣known, but certainly not for excluding their excrements, for
those are ejected at the aperture by which they are taken in. If the
surface of the body of this little creature be examined with a microscope,
it will be found studded with a number of warts, as also the arms,
especially when they are contracted; and these tubercles, as we shall
presently see, answer a very important pur∣pose.</P>
<P>If we examine their way of living, we shall find these
insects chiefly subsisting upon others, much less than themselves,
particularly a kind of millepedes that live in the water, and a very small
red worm, which they seize with great avidity. In short, no insect
whatsoever, less than themselves, seems to come amiss to them; their
arms, as was observed above, serve them as a <PB N="185" REF="183"/> net
would a fisherman, or perhaps more ex∣actly speaking, as a lime-twig does a
fowler. Wherever their prey is perceived, which the ani∣mal effects by its
feeling, it is sufficient to touch the object it would seize upon and it is
fastened, without a power of escaping. The instant one of this insect's
long arms is laid upon a millepede, the little insect sticks without a
possibility of re∣treating. The greater the distance at which it is
touched, the greater is the ease with which the Polypus brings the prey to
its mouth. If the lit∣tle object be near, tho' irretrievably caught, it is not
without great difficulty that it can be brought to the mouth and swallowed.
When the Polypus is unsupplied with prey, it testifies its hunger by
opening its mouth; the aperture, however, is so small that it cannot be
easily perceived; but when, with any of its long arms, it has seized upon
its prey, it then opens the mouth distinct∣ly enough, and this opening is
always in pro∣portion to the size of the animal which it would swallow; the
lips dilate insensibly by small degrees, and adjust themselves
precisely to the figure of their prey. Mr. Trembley, who took a pleasure in
feeding this useless brood, found that they could devour aliments of every
kind, fish and flesh as well as insects; but he owns they did not thrive
so well upon beef and <PB N="186" REF="184"/> veal, as upon the little worms
of their own provi∣ding. When he gave one of these famished rep∣tiles any
substance which was improper to serve for aliment, at first it seized
the prey with avi∣dity, but after keeping it some time entangled near the
mouth, it let drop again with di∣stinguishing nicety.</P>
<P>When several polypi happen to fall upon the same worm, they
dispute their common prey with each other. Two of them are often seen
seizing the same worm at different ends, and dragging it at opposie
directions with great force. It often happens that while one is swal∣lowing
its respective end, the other is also em∣ployed in the same manner, and
thus they con∣tinue swallowing each his part, until their mouths meet
together; they then rest, each for some time in this situation, till the
worm breaks be∣tween them, and each goes off with his share; but it often
happens, that a seemingly more dangerous combat ensues, when the mouths of
both are thus joined upon one common prey to∣gether: the largest polypus then
gapes and swal∣lows his antagonist; but what is very wonderful, the animal
thus swallowed seems to be rather a gainer by the misfortune. After it has
lain in the conquerors body for about an hour, it is∣sues unhurt, and often
in possession of the prey <PB N="187" REF="185"/> which had been the
original cause of conten∣tion; how happy would it be for men, if they had as
little to fear from each other!</P>
<P>These reptiles continue eating the whole year, except when the
cold approaches to congelation; and then, like most others of the insect
tribe, they feel the general torpor of nature, and all their faculties are for
two or three months suspended; but if they abstain at one time, they are
equally voracious at ano∣ther, and like snakes, ants, and other animals that
are torpid in winter, the meal of one day sufficies them for several months
together. In general, however, they devour more largely in proportion to their
size, and their growth is quick exactly as they are fed; such as are best
supplied, soonest acquire their largest size, but they diminish
also in their growth with the same facility, if their food be taken
away.</P>
<P>Such are the more obvious properties of these little animals,
but the most wonderful still remain behind: Their manner of propa∣gation,
or rather multiplication, has for some years been the astonishment of all
the learned of Europe. They are produced in as great a variety of manners as
every species of vegetable. Some polypi are propagated from eggs, as plants
are from their seed; <PB N="188" REF="186"/> some are produced by buds
issuing from their bodies, as plants are produced by inoculation, while all
may be multiplied by cuttings, and this to a degree of minuteness that
exceeds even philosophical perseverance.</P>
<P>With respect to such of this kind as are hatched from the
egg little curious can be added, as it is a method of propagation so com∣mon
to all the tribes of insect nature; but with regard to such as are produced
like buds from their parent stem, or like cuttings from an ori∣ginal root,
their history requires a more de∣tailed explanation. If a polypus be
carefully observed in summer, when these animals are chiefly active, and
more particularly prepared for propagation, it will be found to burgeon forth
from different parts of its body several tubercles or little knobs, which
grow larger and larger every day; after two or three days inspection, what at
first appeared but a small excrescence takes the figure of a small
animal, entirely resembling its parent, furnished with feelers, a mouth,
and all the apparatus for seizing and digesting its prey. This little
crea∣ture every day becomes larger, like the parent, to which it continues
attached; it spreads its arms to seize upon whatever insect is proper for
aliment, and devours it for its own <PB N="189" REF="187"/> particular benefit;
thus it is possessed of two sources of nourishment, that which it
receives from the parent by the tail, and that which it receives from its own
industry by the mouth. The food which these animals receive often tinctures
the whole body, and upon this occa∣sion the parent is often seen
communicating a part of its own fluids to that of its progeny that grows upon
it; while, on the contrary, it never receives any tincture, from any
sub∣stance that is caught and swallowed by its young. If the parent
swallows a red worm, which gives a tincture to all its fluids, the young one
par∣takes of the parental colour; but if the latter should seize upon the
same prey, the parent polypus is no way benefited by the capture, but all the
advantage remains with the young one.</P>
<P>But we are not to suppose that the parent is capable of
producing only one at a time, se∣veral young ones are thus seen at once, of
dif∣ferent sizes, growing from its body, some just budding forth, others
acquiring their perfect form, and others come to sufficient maturity, and
just ready to drop from the original stem to which they had been attached
for several days. But what is more extraordinary still, those young ones
themselves that continue at∣tached <PB N="190" REF="188"/> to their parent,
are seen to burgeon, and propagate their own young ones also, each holding
the same dependance upon its respec∣tive parent, and possessed of
the same advan∣tages that have been already described in the first
connection. Thus we see a surprizing chain of existence continued, and
numbers of animals naturally produced without any union of the sexes, or
other previous disposition of nature.</P>
<P>This seems to be the most natural way by which these
insects are multiplied; their pro∣duction from the egg being not so common;
and tho' some of this kind are found with a little bladder attached to their
bodies, which is supposed to be filled with eggs, which afterwards come to
maturity, yet the artificial method of propagating these animals, is much
more expeditious and equally certain: It is in∣different whether one of them be
cut into ten, or ten hundred parts, each becomes as perfect an animal as that
which was originally divided, but it must be observed, that the smaller
the part which is thus separated from the rest, the longer it will be in
coming to maturity, or in assuming its perfect form. It would be end∣less
to recount the many experiments that have been tried upon this philosophical
prodigy; <PB N="191" REF="189"/> the animal has been twisted, and turned into
all manner of shapes; it has been turned inside out, it has been cut in
every division, yet still it continued to move; its parts adapted
them∣selves again to each other, and in a short time it became as voracious
and industrious as be∣fore.</P>
<P>Besides these kinds mentioned by Mr.Tremb∣ley, there are
various others which have been lately discovered by the vigilance of
succeeding observers, and some of these so strongly re∣semble a
flowering vegetable in their forms, that they have been mistaken by many
natu∣ralists for such. Mr. Hughes, the author of the Natural History of
Barbadoes, has described a species of this animal, but has mistaken its
nature, and called it a sensitive flowering plant; he observed it to take
refuge in the holes of rocks, and when undisturbed, to spread forth a
number of ramifications, each terminated by a flowery petal which shrunk at
the approach of the hand, and withdrew into the hole from whence before it had
been seen to issue. This plant however was no other than an animal of the
polypus kind, which is not only to be found in Barbadoes, but also on many
parts of the coast of Cornwall, and along the shores of the Continent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of Lithophytes and Sponges.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very probable that the animals we see, and are
acquainted with, bear no manner of proportion to those that are concealed
from us. Although every leaf and vegetable swarms with animals upon land, yet
at sea, they are still more abundant; for the greatest part of what would
seem vegetables growing there are in fact nothing but the artificial
formation of insects, palaces which they have built for their own
habitation.</P>
<P>If we examine the bottom of the sea along some shores, and
particularly at the mouths of several rivers, we shall find it has the
ap∣pearance of a forest of trees under water, mil∣lions of plants growing in
various directions, with their branches entangled in each other, and sometime
standing so thick as to obstruct navigation. The shores of the
Persian gulph, the whole extent of the Red-sea, and the western coasts
of America, are so choaked up in many places with these Coraline
substances, that tho' <PB REF="191"/>

<HEAD>The Coral-plants.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>E. Martin sculp.</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="193" REF="192"/> ships force a passage
through them, boats and swimmers find it impossible to make their way.
These aquatic groves are formed of different substances, and assume
various appearances. The coral-plants, as they are called, some∣times shoot
out like trees without leaves in winter; they often spread out a broad
surface like a fan, and not uncommonly a large bund∣ling head, like a faggot;
sometimes they are found to resemble a plant with leaves and flowers; and
often the antlers of a stag, with great exactness and regularity. In other
parts of the sea are seen sponges of various magni∣tude, and
extraordinary appearances, assuming a variety of phantastic forms like
large mushrooms, mitres, fonts and flower-pots. To an atten∣tive spectator
these various productions seem intirely of the vegetable kind; they seem
to have their leaves and their flowers, and have been experimentally known to
shoot out branches in the compass of a year. Philoso∣phers, therefore,
till of late, thought them∣selves pretty secure in ascribing these
producti∣ons to the vegetable kingdom; and Count Marsigli, who has written
very laboriously and learnedly upon the subject of corals and spon∣ges,
has not hesitated to declare his opinion, that they were plants of the
aquatic kind, fur∣nished <PB N="194" REF="193"/> with flowers and seed, and
endued with a vegetation intirely resembling that which is found upon land.
This opinion, however, some time after, began to be shaken by Rumphius and
Jussieu, and at last by the ingeni∣ous Mr. Ellis who by a more
sagacious and dili∣gent enquiry into nature, put it past doubt, that corals
and sponges were entirely the work of animals and that like the honey-comb,
which was formed by the bee, the coral was the work of an infinite number of
reptiles of the polypus kind, whose united labours were thus capable of
filling whole tracts of the ocean with those embarrassing tokens of their
industry.</P>
<P>If in our researches after the nature of these plants, we
should be induced to break off a branch of the coraline substance, and
observe it carefully, we shall perceive its whole surface, which is very
rugged and irregular, covered with a mucous fluid, and almost in every part
studded with little jelly-like drops, which when closely examined, will be
found to be no other than reptiles of the polypus kind. These have their
motions, their arms, their appetites, exactly resembling those described
in the last chapter, but they soon expire when taken out of the sea, and
our curiosity is at once stopped in its <PB N="195" REF="194"/> career, by
the animals ceasing to give any marks of their industry; recourse
therefore has been had to other expedients, in order to de∣termine the nature
of the inhabitant, as well as the habitation.</P>
<P>If a coraline plant be strictly observed, while still
growing in the sea, and the animals upon its surface be not disturbed,
either by the agi∣tation of the waters, or the touch of the ob∣server, the
little polypi will then be seen in infinite numbers, each issuing from
its cell, and in some kinds, the head covered with a little shell,
resembling an umbrella, the arms spread abroad, in order to seize its
prey, while the hinder part still remains attached to its habita∣tion, from
whence it never wholly removes. By this time it is perceived that the number of
inha∣bitants is infinitely greater than was at first sus∣pected; that
they are all assiduously employed in the same pursuits, and that they
issue from their respective cells, and retire into them at plea∣sure.
Still, however, there are no proofs that those large branches which they
inhabit are en∣tirely the construction of such feeble and minute animals.
But chemistry will be found to lend a clue to extricate us from our doubts in
this par∣ticular. Like the shells which are formed by <PB N="196" REF="195"/>
snails, muscles and oysters, these cora∣line substances
effervesce with acids, and may therefore well be supposed to partake of
the same animal nature. But Mr. Ellis went still farther, and examined
their operations, just as they were beginning. Observing an oyster-bed
which had been for some time neglected, he there perceived the first
rudiments of a coraline plantation, and tufts of various kinds shooting from
different parts of this favourable soil. It was upon these he tried his
principal experiment. He took out the oysters which were thus furnished
with cora∣lines, and placed them in a large wooden vessel, covering them
with sea-water. In about an hour, he perceived the animals, which before had
been contracted by handling, and had shewn no signs of life, expanding
themselves in every direction, and appearing employed in their own natural
manner. Perceiving them therefore in this state, his next aim was to
preserve them thus expanded, so as to be permanent objects of curiosity.
For this purpose he poured, by slow degrees, an equal quantity of
boiling-water into the vessel of sea water in which they were immersed.
He then separated each polypus with pincers from its shell, and plunged
each se∣parately into small chrystal vases, filled with spirit 
<PB N="197" REF="196"/> of wine mixed with water. By this means, the animal was
preserved entire, without having time to contract itself, and he thus
perceived a variety of kinds, almost equal to that variety of productions
which these little animals are seen to form. He has been thus able to
perceive and describe fifty different kinds, each of which is seen to
possess its own peculiar mode of con∣struction, and to form a coraline
that none of the rest can imitate. It is true indeed, than on every coraline
substance there are a number of polypi found, no way resembling those
which are the erectors of the building; these may be called a vagabond race
of reptiles, that are only intruders upon the labours of others, and that take
possession of habitations, which they have neither art nor power to
build for themselves. But in general, the same difference that
subsists between the honeycomb of the bee, and the paper-like cells of
the wasp, subsists between the different habitations of the
coral-making polypi.</P>
<P>With regard to the various forms of these substances, they
have obtained different names from the nature of the animal that produced them,
or the likeness they bear to some well∣known object, such as coralines
fungimadre-pores, sponges, astroites, and keratophytes. Tho' 
<PB N="198" REF="197"/> these differ extremely in their outward appear∣ances,
yet they all are formed in the same manner by reptiles of various kinds and
nature. When examined chemically, they all discover the marks of animal
formation; the corals, as was said, dissolve in acids, the sponges burn
with an odour strongly resembling that of burnt horn. We are left
somewhat at a loss with re∣gard to the precise manner in which this
multi∣tude of cells which at last assume the appearance of a plant or
flower, are formed. If we may be led in this subject by analogy, it is most
probable, that the substance of coral is produced in the same manner that
the shell of the snail grows round it; these little reptiles are each
possessed of a slimy matter, which covers its body, and this
hardening, as in the snail, be∣comes an habitation exactly fitted to the body
of the animal that is to reside in it; several of these habitations being
joined together, form at length a considerable mass, and as most ani∣mals
are productive, in proportion to their mi∣nuteness, so these multiplying
in a surprising degree at length form those extensive forests that
cover the bottom of the deep.</P>
<P>Thus all nature seems replete with life; almost every plant
on land has its surface co∣vered with millions of these minute creatures, 
<PB N="199" REF="198"/> of whose existence we are certain, but of whose
uses we are intirely ignorant; while numbers of what seem plants at sea
are not only the receptacles of insects, but also en∣tirely of insect
formation. This might have led some late philosophers into an opinion, that
all nature was animated, that every, even the most inert mass of matter,
was en∣dued with life and sensation, but wanted or∣gans to make those
sensations perceptible to the observer: Those opinions, taken up at
random, are difficultly maintained, and as difficultly refuted; like combatants
that meet in the dark, each party may deal a thousand blows without ever
reaching the adversary. Those perhaps are wiser who view nature as she
offers; who without searching too deeply into the recesses in which she
ultimately hides, are contented to take her as she pre∣sents herself, and
storing their minds with effects, rather than with causes, instead of the
embarrasment of systems, about which few agree, are contented with the
history of appearances, concerning which, all mankind have but one
opinion.</P>

395—best method of classing animals adopted by Ray, Klein, and
Linnaeus, ii. 294, to 299—the author's method of classing them, 301,
to 308—the carnivorous seek their food in gloomy solitude,—they
are sharper than the ruminating kind, and why—ruminating animals most
harmless, and most easily tamed—generally go in herds, for their
mu∣tual security—live entirely upon vegetables, iii. 1—the
meanest of them unite in each other's de∣fence—carnivorous animals have
small stomachs and short intestines—ruminating animals naturally
more indolent and less artful than the carnivorous kinds, and why, iii.

more humble and pliant of dispo∣sition, iii. 25—the large kind of the
torrid zone very fond of the water, iii. 29—some void their dung, when
pursued; this arises rather from fear, than a desire of defence, iii.
32—the number of the cow kind, by naturalists extended to eight or ten
sorts, reduced to two; one animal of the cow kind, no naturalist has
hitherto described, it may be added as a third species—description

about Angora; the inhabitants drive trade with their hair, iii. 58—the

ears, or fineness of the hair, iii. 60—the fat, urine, beak, and even
dung of various animals efficacious in some disorders, iii. 69—of all

rhinoceros, the tiger, and the hippopotamos, iii. 225—of all American,
the tiger the most formidable and mischievous, iii. 245—the
generality have greater agility, greater swiftness, and more formidable
arms, from na∣ture, than man; and their senses, particularly that of
smelling, are far more perfect, iii. 275—those living upon flesh
hunt by nature, iii. 276—all under the influence of man, are subject to

carnivorous kinds only breed annually, and are less fruitful than
others—breed but few at a time, v. 82—where supplies of food are
difficult, the old soon drive the brood from the nest to shift for

hunger—almost all birds of prey unso∣ciable—the male and female

usually prowl alone, v. 83—birds with crooked beaks and talons are
solitary—all males of prey are less, and weaker than the
females—the females are of a greater size, more beautiful and lovely
for shape and colours, stronger, more fierce and generous, than the
males—it may be necessary to be thus superior, to provide for

victory—two male birds strive in song, till the loudest silences
the other; during the contention, the female sits an attentive silent
auditor, and often rewards the loudest songster with her company during
the season, v. 307—the male, while his mate is hatching, sits upon

of driving out their young from the nest to shift for themselves, they
keep them with care, and even when adult do not forsake them—the whole

<ITEM><HI>Caterpillars,</HI> their differences from all other
insects, viii. 4, et seq.—all these animals are hatched from the

are in an egg state, viii. 7—in the aurelia state, they are
seemingly deprived of life and motion, viii. 8—some do not make any
change at the approach of winter, but chuse them∣selves some retreat, and
there remain quite mo∣tionless, and as insensible as if actually
dead—ca∣terpillars of this kind are found in great numbers together,
enclosed in one common web that covers them all—there are some of the

nothing but flesh, and starve upon any other provision, iii.
198—their greatest force lies in the claws, iii. 200—the cat goes
with young fifty-six days; and seldom brings forth above five or six at a
time—the male often devours the kittens—before they are a year old,
they are fit to engender, iii. 203—the female seeks the male with
cries; nor is their co∣pulation performed without great pain; and
why—cats hunt the serpents in the isle of Cy∣prus—any animal
weaker than themselves, is to them an indiscriminate object of
destruction—the mouse is their favourite game, and they patiently
watch a whole day, until the mouse appears, iii. 204, 205—a flagrant
mark by which the cat discovers its natural malignity—their eyes see

212—all the cat kind are kept off by the fires which the inhabitants
light to preserve their herds and flocks—and they hunt ra∣ther by the
sight than the smell, iii. 222—it happens that the lion pursues the
jackall or the wild dog, while they are hunting upon the scent, and mere∣ly
for themselves; the lion is then an unwelcome intruder upon the fruits of
their toil—from thence, probably, has arisen the story of the lion's
provid∣er, iii. 223—the lion devours a great deal at a time, and
generally fills himself for two or three days to come—in the deserts
and forests, his most usual prey are the gazelles, and the monkeys, iii.
223, 224—the race of cats noxious in proportion to their power to do
mischief—inhabit the most torrid latitudes of India, Africa, and
America, and have never been able to multiply beyond the torrid zone; they
seldom attack man, though provoked—of all animals these are the
most sullen, and, to a proverb, untameable, iii. 259—different

v. 87, 88—strong similitude to each other—great patience, and
much art, required to tame an eagle; though taken young, and brought under by
long assiduity, yet it is a dangerous domestic, and often turns its force
against its master, v. 89—sometimes has an attachment for its
feeder; it is then serviceable, and will provide for his pleasures and
support—flies the highest of all birds, and from thence has by the
ancients been called the bird of heaven—it has also the quickest eye;
but its sense of smelling is far inferior to that of the vulture—it
never pursues, but in sight, v. 90—finds difficulty in rising when

sustenance whatever—they are first white, then in∣clining to
yellow, and at last light brown, v. 94—age, hunger, captivity, and
diseases, make them whiter—those kept tame are fed with every kind
of flesh, fresh or corrupting; and upon a deficiency of that, bread, or any
other provision, will suffice—it is dangerous approaching them, if
not quite tame; and they sometimes send forth a loud piercing la∣mentable
cry, which renders them still more for∣midable—they drink but seldom,

invasions the more dis∣agreeable, there being no means of repelling them;
since an attempt to molest a drove would certainly be fatal, iv.
255—manner of going against him who offers the insult—do no
personal in∣jury when suffered to feed uninterrupted—molest∣ed by
man, they seek all occasions to be revenged—where they like best to
live in their natural state—cannot live far from water; and always
disturb it before they drink—often fill their trunk with water, to cool
it, or by way of play to spurt it out like a fountain—equally
distressed by the ex∣tremes of heat and cold—swim from the

migrate from one country to another; and why—their food of the vegetable
kind, loathing all sort of animal diet—one finding a spot of good
pasture, invites the rest to partake of it—precautions by negroes and

the harvest, overturn their habitations, and then re∣treat in order, as they
made the irruption, iv. 257—looks with attention and friendship at its
master—its ears wipe its eyes, and cover them against the dust and
flies—it likes music, learns to beat time, move in measure, and join
its voice to the sound of the drum and trumpet—is pleased with the
odours that delight man, iv. 258—the orange flower particularly grateful

drinks, and smells through the trunk, iv. 259, 260—takes a pin from the

so short that it must turn about to discover what is behind it, iv.

what manner the In∣dians endeavour to prevent it—the flies torment this

of labour, of war, to encrease the grandeur of eastern princes, or to

own riding, kept in a palace, attended by nobles, and almost adored by the

the tone of command from that of anger or approbation, and acts
accordingly—executing orders with prudence, eagerly, yet without
precipitation—is taught to kneel down, to receive its rider, usually
mounted upon its neck—caresses those it knows, salutes such as
ordered to distinguish, and helps to take up part of its load—takes a
pleasure in the finery of its trappings—draws chariots, cannon, or
shipping with strength and perseverance; and satis∣faction, provided it
be not corrected without a cause, and that its master be pleased with its
exer∣tions—in what manner the conductor guides it—frequently takes
such an affection to its keeper as to obey no other; has been known to die of
grief for killing its conductor in a fit of madness—surprising
instance of moderation in its fury—a word sufficient to put it into
motion, iv. 275—a century or two ago the Indian generals made great
dependence <PB REF="305"/> upon the number and the expertness of their
ele∣phants; of late they are little used, except for drawing cannon, and
transporting provisions—still they are used in war in Siam, in

weapons with double force—no∣thing more dreadful, or more

modern arts of war—Romans quickly learned the art of opening their ranks
to admit the elephant, iv. 277—and separating it from assistance,
compell∣ed its conductors to calm the animal's fury, and to
submit—sometimes, instead of obeying, turned upon those it was
employed to assist; one elephant is known to consume as much as forty
men in a day—they are now chiefly employed in carry∣ing or drawing
burthens throughout the pen∣insula of India—it can, with ease, draw
more than six horses can remove—it carries upon its back three or
four thousand weight; and upon its tusks it can support near a
thousand—when pushed, it moves as swiftly as a horse at full
gallop—it travels fifty or sixty miles a day; and hard pressed
almost double that quantity—heard trotting on at a great dis∣tance,
iv. 278—its tract is deeply impressed on the ground, and from fifteen
to eighteen inches in dia∣meter—used, in India, as executioners, and
with what dexterity they perform the horrid task—some∣times they
impale the criminal on their enormous tusks, iv. 279—two surprising

is different from those on the A∣frican coast, iv. 217—an elaborate
description of each must be useless and tiresome, their numbers being
very great, and their differences very trifling—those of two cantons
never found to mix—of all kinds less than the baboon, have less power
of do∣ing mischief, and their ferocity diminishes with their size, iv.
217, 218—do nothing desired without beating; their fears once removed,
they are the most insolent headstrong animals in nature—in their
native woods, are the pests of other ani∣mals, and the masters of the
forest where they re∣side—the tiger, nor the lion will not venture to
dis∣pute dominion with creatures, who from the tops of trees with impunity
carry on an offensive war, and by their agility escape all pursuit, iv.
219—yet they sometimes fall a prey to the lion in deserts and
forests, iii. 223, 224—birds have not less to fear from their
continual depredations—such be∣ing their petulant delight in
mischief, that they fling the eggs against the ground when wanting
ap∣petite to devour them, iv. 219—one only animal in the forest
ventures to oppose them, that is the serpent—larger snakes often
wind up the trees where they reside, and happening to surprize them
sleeping, swallow them whole, before they can make defence—they
generally inhabit the tops of trees, and the snakes cling to the branches
nearer the bottom, in this manner they are near each o∣ther, like enemies in
the same field of battle—some supposed their vicinity rather
argued mutual friend∣ship—father Labat has seen them playing their
gambols upon those branches on which the snakes <PB REF="402"/> were
reposing, and jumping over them without re∣ceiving any injury, iv.
220—they provoke the snake as the sparrows twitter at a
cat—when attacked, they show perfect skill in defending and
assisting each other—they regularly begin hostilities against
those who enter their woods, iv. 221—they take most desperate
leaps, and seldom come to the ground—one being wounded, the rest come
round, put their fingers into the wound, as de∣sirous of sounding its
depth—the blood flowing in any quantity, some stop it, while others
get leaves, chew, and thrust them into the opening—are often killed in
numbers before they make a retreat, with the same precipitation as they at
first came on—in this retreat the young are clinging to the back of the
female, who jumps away, seem∣ingly unembarrassed by the burthen, iv.
222—usual way of taking them alive—the monkey not killed
outright, does not fall; but clinging to some branch, continues, when dead,
its last grasp, and remains where shot, until it drops by putrefaction,
iv. 223—skinned and served up at negroe-feasts, so like a child,
an European is shocked at the sight, iv. 224—the negroes seeing
Europeans buy young and tame monkies, with equal care brought rats to the
factors for sale, and were greatly disappointed find∣ing no
purchaser—negroes cannot comprehend ad∣vantages arising from
educating or keeping animals who come in companies to lay waste fields of
corn or rice, or plantations of sugar-canes—they carry off what they
are able, and destroy ten times more, iv. 224, 225—manner of their
plundering—are un∣der a kind of discipline, exercised among
themselves, iv. 225—account to this purpose by Morgrave—one
species, by Mr. Buffon called the ouarine, remarkable for loudness and
distinctness of voice—use to which they convert it—are
generally together in com∣panies, march in exact order, and obey the voice of
some chieftain, remarkable for his size and gra∣vity, iv. 226—chief
food of the tribe, iv. 227—ex∣traordinary <PB REF="403"/> manner of
managing an oyster—manner of drawing crabs from the water,—no
snare, how nicely baited, takes a monkey of the West Indian
islands—female brings forth one, and sometimes two at a
time—rarely breed when brought into Europe—the male and female
never tired of fondling their young, and in∣struct it with no little
assiduity—often severely cor∣rect it, if stubborn, or
disinclined to profit by their example—manner of carrying their young
in the woods, iv. 227, 228—dexterity in passing from one tree to
another, by forming a kind of chain, lock∣ing tail in tail, or hand in hand,
iv. 229—one amused itself for hours imposing upon the gravity of a
cat—and playing its pranks among rabbits, iv. 230—faithful
services which father Carli received from the monkies in Angola, where he
went to convert the savage natives to Christianity—savages of
Africa and America, suppose monkies to be men; idle, slothful, ra∣tional
beings, capable of speech and conversa- but obstinately dumb, for fear of
being compelled to labour—monkies of Africa most expert and
entertaining, iv. 231—shew a greater degree of cunning and
activity—three marks by which mon∣kies of the new continent are
distinguished from those of the old, iv. 232—Mr. Buffon makes but

two kinds, the grey and the red; the grey is most prolific, and always keep
on the ground—the red less common, and perches upon trees—the
partridge is found in every country, and climate—in Greenland, where it
is brown in summer, becomes white in winter, v. 208, 209—those of
Barakonda are larger legged, swifter of foot, and reside in the highest
rocks—partridges of all sorts agree in one character, being
immoderately addict∣ed to venery; often to an unnatural degree—the 
<PB REF="431"/> male pursues the hen to her nest, and breaks her eggs,
rather than be disappointed—the young having kept in flocks during the
winter, break so∣ciety in spring, when they begin to pair; and terrible
combats ensue—their manners otherwise resemble those of poultry,
but their cunning and instincts are superior, v. 209—means the female

peacocks to the tables of the great, not to be eaten, but seen; in what
manner they served them—its flesh is said to keep longer
unputrefied than any other, v. 173—has a predilection for
barley—but as a proud and fickle bird, there is scarce any food it will
at all times like—it strips the tops of houses of tiles or thatch,
lays waste the labours of the garden∣er, roots up the choicest seeds, and
nips favourite flowers in the bud—is still more salacious than the

hen—the pea-hen, as much as possible hides her nest from him, that
he may not disturb her sitting—she seldom lays above five or

twelve—in forests where they breed naturally, they are very
numerous—this bird lives about twenty years—and not till the third
