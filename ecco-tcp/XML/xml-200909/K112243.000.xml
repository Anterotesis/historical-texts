ACCOUNT of several remarka∣ble Facts not mentioned by other Historians of

<P>Written by Sir RICHARD BULSTRODE, Resident at

Envoy from King JAMES II. till the Revolution 1688.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN the Posthumous Pieces of any Author have for some Years
lain in Obscurity, and at last come into the World, the Publisher, for
his own Reputation, is obliged to satisfy the Publick, that they are the
genuine Productions of that Pen to which his Title Page pretends to ascribe
them.</P>
<P>THAT these MEMOIRS may fall un∣der no Suspicions of being
spurious, it is necessary that I should account for <PB REF="4"/> their
coming into my Possession. When I was last Year in <HI>Paris,</HI> it
was my good Fortune to contract some Acquain∣tance with a younger Son of Sir
<HI>Richard Bulstrode,</HI> who then resided there, as Governour in the
Family of the young Earl of <HI>Fingal.</HI> I had not long enjoy'd the Honour
of his Conversation, before he frankly gave me the Copy of these MEMOIRS,
with free Liberty to make them publick to the World, and assured me they
were all wrote by the Hand of Sir <HI>Richard</HI> his Father. The Town is
therefore indebted to this Gentleman's Generosity, and are to look upon me as
an Agent that labours to be faithful in acquitting my self of a Charge
intrusted to me.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have thought it a neces∣sary Piece of Justice, to
have made a Character of Sir <HI>Richard Bulstrode</HI> a Part of this
Preface, but find all that is re∣quisite on this Head is already done by
<HI>Whitlock Bulstrode,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> likewise a Son of the
Author, and who has obliged the Publick with a Volume of his Father's 
<PB REF="5"/> Essays, Printed in <HI>Octavo</HI> in the Year 1715, where the
Reader may be enter∣tained with a preliminary Account, how well Sir
<HI>Richard</HI> was qualify'd both for an Author and Statesman.</P>
<P>IF these Sheets could stand in need of any other Proof of
their being ge∣nuine, than the Assertion I have given from whose Hands I
received them, I could not desire a stronger concurring Testimony than
those Essays. Every Judge, who will do himself the Plea∣sure of a
Comparison, will find both those and the MEMOIRS penn'd in the same
Style, and with the same Cast of Thought and Spirit of Language. The
Contents being Matter of Fact, they should neither be partial, nor of a
Par∣ty; yet if some will think he reflects too severely, let them
consider he wrote at a Time when Faction and Presbytery had undone his Royal
Master, and left a very poor Prospect of the Kingdom it self escaping
from their Rancour.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE <HI>Reign</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> OF K.
<HI>CHARLES</HI> the I<SUP>st.</SUP></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is natural for all Men, when streightened with Fears, to run
for Shelter to what their Fancy presents as an Instru∣ment of their Ease
and Reme∣dy; but he that hath Time to deliberate, unless he places his Hopes
upon something that is like to ease his Pain, by making his Afflictions
less, or his Pa∣tience <PB N="2" REF="23" MS="y"/> more, deserves that
Misery he groans under: But Afflictions which come by God's Appointment,
represent the Sadness of Morta∣lity, and become Monuments of Mens Piety and
Devotion. In the unnatural War, which the Subjects of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.
began against their most lawful Sovereign, contrary to all Solemnies of
Christianity, and of all that is called Good, I was then very young, and in a
Labyrinth, not knowing well which Way to go; but at last I resolved to go
to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> with some Gentlemen of the <HI>Inner-Temple,</HI>
be∣ing then newly come thither from <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where I had been bred,
in <HI>Pembroke-Hall.</HI> I was brought up to <HI>London</HI> by my Father,
from <HI>Coventry,</HI> where we then dwelt: We were all brought into the
King's Presence by the Lord Chamberlain, and had the Honour to kiss the
King's Hands, who took our Coming very kind∣ly, and at the same time told us,
he hoped he should have no need of our Service.</P>
<P>About this Time, the King, and the Laws, (who by God and Man
respectively are appoin∣ted the sole Protectors of Innocence and Truth) had
themselves, I thought, the greatest need of a Protector; and when I
consider'd our King's Case, in the Beginning of his Troubles, me-thought it
was much like to that of King <HI>David,</HI> who was vexed with a Civil War,
both by his Son <HI>Absalom,</HI> and by his own People: But the Case of
our King was worse than that of King <HI>David</HI>; for the Text says, his
Enemies kept about him <HI>like Bees,</HI> and were extinct; there was 
<PB N="3" REF="24"/> some Honey with them; but our King's Ene∣mies came about
him like Hornets, where there was all Sting, and no Honey. And indeed the
King's Case was rather like that of <HI>Isaac</HI> ready to be
sacrificed; the Wood was prepared, the Fire kindled, the Knife was lift up,
and the Hand was striking; and if the King's loyal Sub∣jects had not been
something like <HI>Abraham</HI> too, having, out of Hope, believed in Hope,
we had been as much without Comfort, as we were in outward Appearance without
Remedy. Indeed I then saw such unparallel'd Revolutions in our
<HI>English</HI> Monarchy, as I hope will never be imi∣tated, and will be
scarce credited in After-Ages; whereupon I have thought it worth my Time to
give some Account of those great and strange Transactions, wherein I
was personally engag'd, which are still fresh in my Memory, having
faithfully served King <HI>Charles</HI> I. from the Year 1640, which Civil
War ended not till 1648, in the most deplorable Murder of the best of
Kings, whose Cause at last God so owned, and so vindicated his
Honour, that never Prince was more truly lamented, nor his Posterity, by
divine Providence, more wonderfully re-esta∣blished, without the
Assistance of any foreign Power, tho' his rebellious Subjects used all
possible Diligence, (which either Wit or Malice could invent) to extirpate
the Royal Family, both Root and Branch.</P>
<P>I presume, the Duty of my publick Employ∣ments abroad, under
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II. will in some Measure
plead my Excuse <PB N="4" REF="25"/> for giving some Relations of the War of
King <HI>Charles</HI> I. which have not yet been mention'd, and of those
sudden Changes, and violent Re∣volutions happen'd in the last Age; and
being now grown old to all worldly Pleasures, after many long and faithful
Services to the Crown, and being wholly unacquainted with the Know∣ledge of
Riches, or with the Cares of increasing them, or the Fears of losing them,
and finding little Taste in common Conversation, I have spent my latter
Years in writing some Memoirs, Poems, and other Discourses, to shew
that I have not spent my last Days in Idleness and Vanity; and that
since I can no longer live in an active Life, I may not die an unprofitable
Servant. And yet I have but small Inclination to write, when the Number of
Scribblers in this last Age hath given the World a Surfeit, by the
mischievous Liberty of Writing, where∣by great Advantage hath been taken, to
corrupt People with false Notions of Government, which hath destroyed
Millions of Men, by engaging them in such a Rebellion, as no Age or Nation
can equal, under Pretence of Reli∣gion and Law: And tho' at first it did not
break out into Blood, but was carried on for some time with Paper
Skirmishes, yet at last it grew too strong for both; and according to the
usual Practice, when any Rebellion was hatch∣ing, they that designed it,
immediately cry'd out, <HI>Hannibal ad Portas,</HI> and that what they did, was
to preserve their Religion, Laws, Li∣berties and Properties, when none of
them were <PB N="5" REF="26"/> in Danger; and when they most flattered their
Sovereign, and called God to witness the Purity of their Intentions, even
then they were prepa∣ring their Weapons to murder him. And as it is seen in
natural Bodies, that Fatness of Diet doth for the most Part lay the
Foundation of Maladies, which cannot be expell'd by the most skillful
Physician, without the Use of some ex∣traordinary Medicines; so, in our
Body Poli∣tick, we were bless'd with long Peace, with Riches and Plenty the
Product of it, and by the propitious Influence of our King, when we thus
flourished, we went only to throw away those blessed Fruits of Peace,
so that the whole Body Politick was quickly out of Order: And tho' perhaps
there were some Errors and Irre∣gularities in the Government, yet they
pro∣ceeded not from any Pravity of Disposition in the King, nor from any
Principles of Arbitrary Government; it being confessed by the King's
greatest Enemies, that he was indued with the best and purest Morals, of
any Prince that ever held the <HI>English</HI> Scepter. But his People
thought that some evil Counsellours did capti∣vate him at their Pleasure,
and did thrust his Majesty into Actions prejudicial to himself and the
common Good; upon which they were in∣vited by that rebellious Parliament to
take Arms, under the plausible Shew of Reformation and Liberty, when many of
them, in the Simplici∣ty of their Hearts, never had the least Intenti∣on of
abridging the King of any of his just Pre∣rogative, but only to restrain
some Excesses in <PB N="6" REF="27"/> Government, which they really
thought were the Excrescences of sovereign Power, and were rather Burthens
than Ornaments of his royal Diadem. Indeed his very Example would have had a
greater Influence upon his Subjects, than the strictest Laws. He was so
great a Lover of Justice, and so great a Justiciar himself, that no
Temptations could dispose him to a wrongful Action, unless it were so
disguised to him, that he believed it to be just; and yet I cannot but
confess, that a Prince's Fame, in this World, depends more upon his wise
Administration, than upon his private Morality and good Life. The Goodness
of his Government depends chiefly upon those that advise him, who are to
yield unto their Prince all the Reputation ari∣sing from their good
Counsels, and never to in∣tercept the Honour of them from the King: It being
an infallible Maxim, That he is not the worst King, that is the worst Man,
but he who hath the worst Counsellours and Instruments under him.</P>
<P>The Laws of <HI>England</HI> making them the on∣ly Persons
obnoxious to be arraigned and puni∣shed, being in the King's Confidence, and
in the Head of his Affairs, these should have been pitched upon to answer
criminally for all those things which were then called Miscarriages; the
Law having mark'd them out as Offenders, and as Offerings of Attonement for the
King's Faults (were he guilty of any) but instead of this, the King (whom all
the Laws of the Land, and the Constitution it self, hold not only
un∣punishable, <PB N="7" REF="28"/> but innocent) was elected as the
Scape-Goat, to have the Offences of his Mini∣sters, and the subordinate
Tools of the Govern∣ment, transmitted and laid upon him.</P>
<P>Thus Rebels are never without some Pretext to palliate their
Actions; and rather than fail, will make their Vizard of Religion, which (if
true) is a Setler, not a Stickler in Government: She confirms Men in Obedience,
and does not en∣courage them in Rebellion. It is a great Mi∣stake indeed, to
think Peace is well enough preserved, if the Sword be not drawn, and think it
not War, because we do not take the Field; whereas, we may as well call it
Health, when there is a dangerous Fermentation in the Blood, because the
Patient hath not taken his Bed: For certainly, where there is not a firm
Trust between the King and his People, from a due Obedience to his Laws and
Government, and a steady Care not to remove the ancient Landmarks, not to
disturb those Constitutions, which the Wisdom of our Ancestors hath
set∣led, in order to preserve the whole Frame of the Government upon the
old Foundations: When any of these fail, the Kingdom must needs fall into
Confusion, as was miserably seen in the Time of this unhappy Prince.</P>
<P>But, to find the Beginning of these Evils, we must look back
as far as Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where we shall discover the
Presbyterians con∣triving what they have since put in Execution, to the
eternal Scandal of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. Their Religion hath always
been imperious, <PB N="8" REF="29" MS="y"/> turbulent, and bloody, and hath
embroil'd all Places with Rebellion, where it once got Foot∣ing, from its
first Rise at <HI>Geneva,</HI> to its Re∣move into <HI>France,</HI> from
thence into <HI>Holland,</HI> so into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from thence to
its Arrival in <HI>England.</HI> They are impatient of any kind of Government;
Theocracy it self would not please them, for they conclude against all
Governments. From their first Institution, they shewed their Hatred
against Monarchs, and they still glory to have had a principal Part in
most of the Commotions of Christendom, since they took up the Work of
Reformation; and by their frequent Insurrections in <HI>England,</HI> they
gave the first Occasion of saying, <HI>Rex Angliae, Rex Diabolorum.</HI>
The rest of Schismaticks are but their Spawn; <HI>Calvin</HI> first
founded his Presbytery and Treason: For when they at <HI>Geneva</HI> had,
in his Absence, expell'd their lawful Prince, he not only encourag'd, but
confirm'd what they had done, at his Return. Presbytery never was received
into any State, where it did not embroil; never any Man was possessed
with it, whom it did not strangely transform with Moroseness; all their
Writings are stuff'd with reproachful Language against the sacred
Persons of Princes, with Dethroning Principles, and King-killing Doctrines,
as may be seen in <HI>Calvin</HI>'s <HI>Institutions,</HI> in that of
<HI>Junius Brutus,</HI> in <HI>Vindiciae contra Tyrannos,</HI> written by
<HI>Beza,</HI> and <HI>Knox</HI>'s <HI>Appellation to the People,</HI> and
<HI>Buchanan</HI>'s <HI>Jus Regni apud Scotos,</HI> which he had the Impudence
to dedicate to King <HI>James</HI>; <PB N="9" REF="30"/> in which Book, and
others of their Writings, they say, The People are the Original of all just
Power, and that wicked Kings, for their Misgovernment, may be put to Death by
their Subjects: An impious Principle! justly con∣demn'd, and fitted only for
the Mouth of a <HI>Ravilliac.</HI> History tells us, that, in the Reigns of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the
Presbyterians were always grum∣bling and murmuring against the Times, their
whole Practice being to deprive God of his Glory, the Prince of his Honour, and
the Peo∣ple of their Senses, affirming the Condition of <HI>England</HI> was
miserable. In the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Pulse of the
People began to beat high (by the Instigation of the Presby∣terians)
towards an Aristocratical Government, under a Kingly Title, and the malicious
Ene∣mies of the Church and State did then begin to appear; but that watchful
Queen was soon alar∣med, and so asserted her Prerogative, that she
kept all in their Duty: She declared, and pro∣tested publickly, that no
Trouble should arrive to the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, for any Difference in
Religion (which did much abate the Opposition which might possibly have
been made by them) hoping for fair Quarter under her Government. She knew well,
that a King or Queen of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> how sovereign soever, could not
establish a new Religion in their Kingdom, without the Authority and
Countenance of a Parliament; and therefore, to win the Bishops, and the
rest of the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks in Parliament, at <PB N="10" REF="31"/>
least to Obedience, she was content to use Poli∣cy with them, and would
qualify the Style of Supreme Head of the Church and State, to that of Supreme
Governour, which, tho' it al∣ter'd not the Sense, yet it abused many into a
Belief or Conceit, that the Queen pretended not so much Primacy
Ecclesiastick as the King her Father had done, who was the first King of
<HI>England</HI> that ever gave Cause to try the ad∣mirable Patience and
Obedience of his Catho∣lick Subjects, who took not Arms against their
Sovereign, and had no other Weapons but <HI>Praeces &amp; Lachrymae,</HI> the
Prayers and Tears of the Church for their Refuge.</P>
<P>Indeed Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was so careful, that the
Parliament could make no Impression upon her Sovereignty; and tho' the Cry
of Persecu∣tion was pretty loud, and that the Enemies of Church and State
were troublesome to her, yet, by her constant Resolution, she was not
over∣borne by any Faction; and finding it easier to crop them in the Bud,
than to pull them up by the Roots, she took the right Course with them, by
putting the Schismaticks under the Statute of Recusancy, equal with the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, whereby she quieted All; and often declared in
Parliament, That both Houses had only Au∣thority to advise and consent to
what they thought was for the common Good and Benefit of her Subjects: And
wherever the Prince is not jealous of Underminers, and active to pre∣serve
the establish'd Government, there will never want Spirits to attempt a
Change, and <PB N="11" REF="32"/> make Religion a Shelter for their Rebellion.
It is certain, the <HI>English</HI> have always loved those Princes best,
who grounded their Power in the Affections of their People, who ruled them by
their old Laws, and used such moderate Power, as was consistent with
their Government, rather than such as aim'd at any Change, which might tend
to subvert their ancient Constitution; and seldom any Prince hath
miscarried, who con∣stantly pursued the publick Good, and directed all
his Counsels to his Country's Ease; but those Princes have been full of
disastrous Troubles, who have obstinately adhered to a Few, against the
Whole, and have conferred that Affection to particular Persons, which
should be exten∣ded to the universal Body of the People.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Excellency of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI>'s
Government was, that, at her first Coming to the Crown, she found a Council
of able Ministers (which in the last Age were not seen) which she
continued, who managed the publick Affairs with such prudent Conduct, that
their Counsels and Actions, as they were either Gown or Sword Men, gave great
Satisfaction, and had great Influence upon the whole Nation. But her
Successor, King <HI>James,</HI> was not so wary, who came to the Crown
under many Difficulties; for, the Mixture of a Stranger Nation, formerly upon
no good Terms with <HI>England,</HI> the Subjection of it to a Stranger Prince,
whose Nature and Disposition being unknown, could not but prove of very
ill Con∣sequence, who let that ill Humour in the Peo∣ple 
<PB N="12" REF="33" MS="y"/> imbibe so fast, that it soon bred in them a
violent Contumacy against the Prerogative: And this King <HI>James</HI>
minding his Pleasures more than his Business, his Favourites were more
esteemed than his Statesmen; who there∣upon permitted his Favourite
<HI>Scotchmen</HI> (coming out of a poor mountainous Country, into a rich Soil)
to make a Harvest of the Crown Reve∣nue; and when handsom Mr.
<HI>Villiers</HI> was brought into Favour (for Handsomness went a great Way
in our Court) he came suddenly to have so prodigious an Ascent upon the
King, that he entirely disposed of all his Favours, and did whatever he
pleas'd.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of this King's Government, the King had no great
Choice of excellent Men; and Mr. <HI>Villiers</HI>'s Ascent was so quick,
that it seem'd rather a Flight than a Growth; and he was such a Darling of
Fortune, as if he had been born a Favourite, being Supreme the first Month he
came to Court. However, he was very unfortunate in the Election of his
Depen∣dants, few of his Servants being qualified enough to advise him, and
were intent only of grow∣ing rich under him, and not upon their Ma∣ster's
being as Good as Great. And if this great Favourite had been so happy as to
have had but one faithful Friend, that Person might have done great Service
to both his Masters, even to Father and Son. In King <HI>James</HI> the
Father's Time, he took the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI>
contrary to the King's Opinion, who yet submitted to him; and upon a
particular <PB N="13" REF="34"/> Discontent of his own, broke the intended
Marriage, and brought back the Prince, to the great Satisfaction both of King
and People; which Action was so highly approved in the last Parliament of
that King, that the Duke of <HI>Bucks</HI> was called, The Saviour of the
People; and the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> then Ambassador at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> was recalled, and Articles exhibited against him by the
Duke, and by his Interest was kept out of the House of Lords. Now all that
happen'd in <HI>Spain</HI> is here very well worth relating, which I have had
from a very sure Hand, which hath been kept private from many.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> was employ'd Ambassador in
<HI>Spain</HI> by King <HI>James,</HI> to treat of the Marri∣age with the then
<HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> being zealous
for the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion, insisted to procure some
Favours for the <HI>English Roman</HI> Catholicks, which related no farther,
than to a Freedom of Religion for the <HI>Infanta,</HI> her Servants, and the
Children of the Marriage, and her Ecclesiasticks and Reli∣gious, which
could not be done, without the King's particular Licence and Dispensation;
to which the King assented. But this Affair being longer delayed, the
<HI>Spanish</HI> King urged farther, in Favour of the <HI>English
Roman</HI> Catholicks in general (but the Manner and Way of doing it, was to be
left to his Majesty's Wisdom:) Where∣upon King <HI>James</HI> and Prince
<HI>Charles</HI> both signed; and King <HI>James,</HI> for farther
Satisfaction, did, by the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> his then Secretary of State,
dated <HI>Aug.</HI> 7. 1623. declare and engage, <PB N="14" REF="35"/> That his
said Majesty would cause a present Suspension, under the Great Seal
of <HI>England,</HI> of all those penal Laws whereunto his <HI>Roman</HI>
Catholick Subjects were before subject, and under the same Great Seal would
give a Dispen∣sation and Toleration to all his <HI>Roman</HI> Catho∣lick
Subjects, as well Priests as temporal Per∣sons. The Marriage not taking
Effect, and Animosities happening betwixt the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
and the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the Earl, before King <HI>James</HI>'s
Death having been impea∣ched in Parliament; yet he wrought so with the
House of Commons, as to impeach the Duke, who then prevailed with his
present Majesty, that the Impeachment of the Earl should be first try'd
in the same Parliament, thereby to cause the Earl to forbear Prosecution
of his Charge against the Duke, or to invalidate his Testimony. One of the
Articles charged against the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> was, <HI>That he
counselled and perswaded King</HI> James, <HI>to grant and allow the
Papists free Toleration, and silencing all Laws made against them.</HI>
But the Earl positively de∣nied this Article, and said, it was only
decla∣red, <HI>That he would dispense with the Laws, which imported no more
than a Permission to ex∣ercise their Religion in private Houses, and to
suspend the Execution of the Laws against them for a time; all which the
King had Power to do:</HI> But to grant a free Toleration, imports an
Al∣lowance of publick Worship, and the silencing all Laws against them,
might import a total Repeal, <HI>which the King did not claim a Right</HI> 
<PB N="15" REF="36"/> <HI>to do himself.</HI> When the Impeachment was brought
into the Lords House, the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> did put in his Answer
to it, and posi∣tively denied, that he had counselled any thing in the
Matter charged, and declared fully what was done, and what was signed by the
late King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI>; as also the Decla∣ration
made by the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> by the King's Order; and added, <HI>That the
Duke of</HI> Buckin∣gham <HI>being then the greatest Minister of State, and
Favourite to King</HI> James, <HI>did advise all things in the Affair: That
the Lord</HI> Conway <HI>certainly signed the Declaration.</HI> The Earl
wanted neither Wit nor Courage to charge the Duke with Crimes as
distasteful as he could find any; and he spared not the Lord
<HI>Conway,</HI> who was the Duke's Friend, and must have been the best
Witness to save the Duke, in case the Charge had been prosecuted. The
Parliament then sit∣ting was as diligent to enquire into Misde∣meanours, as
much displeased with the Duke, and as little fond of the Lord
<HI>Conway,</HI> then Secretary of State, and were as much enclined to enquire
into the too much advancing or stretching the King's Prerogative, to the
Preju∣dice of the Subject, and against the Laws, as any Parliament which ever
sat in <HI>England. Yet neither did the Parliament, or the Earl of</HI>
Bri∣stol, <HI>charge any thing against the Duke, or the Lord</HI> Conway,
<HI>for advising to dispense with Pe∣nal Laws, nor did the Parliament
prosecute the Earl of</HI> Bristol <HI>upon the Impeachment against
him,</HI> tho' he was thereby particularly charged <PB N="16" REF="37" MS="y"/>
for advising the King to dispense with the Penal Laws. <HI>Now, if
King</HI> James <HI>and King</HI> Charles I. <HI>did pass any Act of
Parliament (as some affirm) to bar themselves or the Crown of this Right,
the same could be only intended as to the ordi∣nary Exercise of that
Right,</HI> but not to the ex∣traordinary, where the publick Good requires the
same should be exercised. The King's Pro∣ceedings were to be thus
intended, and not otherwise, which was proved by the King's continual
Exercise of that Power, in the Suspen∣sion of Penal Laws, never
questioned or com∣plained of, but still submitted unto, and admit∣ted as
legal; <HI>as namely, those touching the Im∣portation of</HI> French
<HI>Wines:</HI> And it was clear by his Majesty's Practice for many Years,
that he thought it both reasonable and legal, to con∣tinue the
Dispensations by which his Majesty suspended many Laws, without any
Oppo∣sition.</P>
<P>About this Time a War was declared with <HI>Spain,</HI> which was
carried on by the violent Humour of the Duke, whose Power was so great,
that he govern'd all without a Rival; which Preheminence he managed very
unthrif∣tily, disposing of all Places to his own Relati∣ons, where there
was no Advantage or Profit to be had. <HI>This Partiality shewed the Duke's
Weakness, and was much unbecoming the Great∣ness of the King his Master,
whose Honour should shine upon the whole Body of his People, as the Sun
sheds his Influence, warming all Parts of the Earth.</HI> And where Kings
shew them∣selves <PB N="17" REF="38"/> partial to a Party, they are
usually served by the worst of the People, and are often forced to
protect the Bad against the Good, as we have often seen in our late
Revolutions: Not that Subjects repine, that Princes should have Friends with
whom they may communicate their Thoughts, and unbend their Cares, nor to see
such better'd by their Favours, which is warranted by the Example of the
best of Kings, who must sometimes recreate themselves, and not be
always upon their Thrones, which would too much weary them. Greatness must
be set aside sometimes, the better to be relished: But Subjects do
behold with Indignation, Men to be exalted, who abuse their Prince's Favours,
and by false Representations, traduce all others, that they may ingross
the Prince to themselves, with∣out Regard to the King's Honour, when their
par∣ticular Advantage or Safety is in Question. Such Ministers are
generally hated, and the People commonly reach their Heads at last. Wise
Prin∣ces should never protect such Ministers; for when Princes bring
Projectors into the Administration of their Affairs, who are Inventers of new
Taxes, they bring an Odium upon their Master; and the Ignorance of such Men
brings more Necessities upon the Prince, than their Arts of raising
Mo∣ney can supply. None but wanting Princes employ such Men, who
sometimes can skin over a Sore, which after breaks out with greater
Rancour: Whereas wise Statesmen would, by wholesom Counsel, obviate the
Danger in its Growth, and restrain their King's extravagant 
<PB N="18" REF="39"/> Bounty, before he hath nothing left to give: For the
Bounty of a Prince often frights Men from meddling in their Affairs. I know,
Li∣berality is counted the proper Virtue of a Prince, it being much better for
him to be pro∣fuse, than avaritious, Prodigality having the Resemblance of
something more noble, than Avarice, and really it is less odious; and they
that gain by it, make it pass for a Virtue, but perhaps it is more
prejudicial to Posterity, and no less dangerous than the other Extreme. For
if a King give away his whole Kingdom, he cannot satisfy all that ask, no,
nor all that think they deserve much from him. It is then more convenient to
give with Reason, and ne∣ver to draw so near the Bottom, but that Princes
may always have wherewith to gratify Persons of Merit; and above all, they
should take espe∣cial Care, that their Liberality be exercised without
Oppression of their People, to avoid Murmuring, which may produce
Rebellion. Wise Kings should never give, till their Coffers are full; for
the Measures of Bounty ought to be taken from the Plenty of the Giver, as
well as the Merit of the Receiver: And Kings seldom hurt themselves by
giving what is actually in their Keeping, for Reward of particular Merit, but
giving things they never had (as King <HI>James</HI> I. actually did to his
Favourites) of which they know not the Value, is the Ruin of Princes
Treasure, and consequently of their Affairs. For the Necessities of
wanting Princes make them repeat Taxes, which loses them the 
<PB N="19" REF="40"/> Affection of their Subjects; and Thrift hath ever been
esteemed a Point of good Wisdom in Kings, who should stand firm
against all parti∣cular Suits, so that no Case, upon what Grace soever,
may break the Rule; for if one strong Sheep breaks the Hedge, a Hundred
little ones will follow: And therefore the first thing a King should learn
to say, is <HI>No,</HI> and that so re∣solutely, as never to be asked
twice, nor once importunately: For one extravagant Gift to one, raises the
Market to every Man else; and the unlimited Bounty of a wanting Prince, makes
him a Beggar, tho' he have a vast Reve∣nue: And that Prince, who will give
more to Importunity than Merit, may as reasonably forbid his Subjects doing
well, upon Penalty of being undone by it. Where Princes give, be∣cause they
are importun'd, and where the less useful Part of the People have most
Credit with their King, this shews, the Way to get every thing, is to be good
for nothing; and tho' the servile Part of Mankind are apt to extol, not only
generous Princes, but those that are pro∣fuse; yet if we consider the
Story of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, we shall find their Decadence took its
Rise principally from this profuse Temper, and that their Prodigality drove
them to Want, and made them oppress, and become odious to their People, by
their frequent Taxes. But we need not now make Laws against giving too much,
Princes are not so free in this Age, and we want no Overseer of that kind,
in our Court, at <HI>St. Germaine</HI>'s, where we live upon Alms.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="41"/>The good Emperor, <HI>Marcus Aurelius
Antoni∣nus,</HI> in his Nature very bountiful, having given the People a larger
Donative than usual, was yet so frugal of the publick Money, that, upon an
Expedition against the <HI>Scythians,</HI> he would not draw any Sum from the
Treasury, without first asking Leave of the Senate, affirming that he had
nothing in particular, and not so much as the House he lived in. And being
another Time pressed by his Army, for a Donative, after a signal Victory,
he refused it, saying, <HI>The more I give the young Soldiers, the more I
must oppress their Parents.</HI> And therefore the <HI>Romans</HI> well
answer'd one of their Emperors demanding double Taxes: <HI>O Emperor, if thou
wilt have double Taxes, we must have double Harvests.</HI> Kings are
Fathers of their Country, but unless they keep their own Estates, they are
such Fathers as the Sons maintain, which is against the Order of Nature,
and the less a Father depends upon his Children, the more he is certainly
respected.</P>
<P>The Love of Subjects is not obtained by Mo∣ney, but by wise
Government, and good Con∣duct; and all People, even Soldiers, reverence their
Prince more, who keeps something in his Power to give, than he who gives all
away; Ex∣pectation and Hope carrying Men farther than the Sense of past or
present Benefits, and good Princes desire to make their People easy. King
<HI>Charles</HI> I. of <HI>England</HI> never refused to ease his People of
any Grievance, and passed more Acts of Grace for the Benefit of his
Subjects, than <PB N="21" REF="42"/> any five Kings or Queens had done before
him. He granted an Act of Triennial Parliament, and the perpetuating of them,
was an Act unparal∣lel'd by any of his Predecessors: And good Sub∣jects
should never think it just, that the King's Condition should be worse,
by bettering theirs. But our good King counted himself undimini∣shed by his
largest Concessions, thinking by them to gain the Love of his People,
being perswaded he could not grant too much, nor distrust too little, to
Men that being professed∣ly his Subjects, pretended singular Piety, and
religious Strictness. But our King was much mistaken, for no Fountain of
Royal Bounty was able to satisfy their <HI>Corban</HI> of Religion: And it is
sure, had that good King yielded less, he had been opposed less; and
had he denied more, he had been more obeyed. Princes should therefore take
Care of running with the Stream; for, chusing a crooked Course, for fear of
the Torrent, is not commonly very dangerous.</P>
<P>The Honour of a King consists chiefly in doing good to the
universal Body of his People, which good <HI>Charles</HI> aim'd at, there
being no∣thing so glorious for a Prince, as to let his Peo∣ple enjoy Ease
and Plenty, and not to enrich a few Persons with the Spoils of a whole
Coun∣try. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France</HI> said, he hoped so to order
Matters, that every Man in his Kingdom might have a boil'd Capon for his
Dinner. Cer∣tainly, no Apothegm, so much by the Ancients commended, could
so well become the Mouth <PB N="22" REF="43"/> of a great King, as this
well-natur'd Saying; and it is probable, had he lived, he would have made good
his Word, which would have been a more durable Triumph to his Fame, than all
his great Victories; and his Example, who, by his Frugality, brought the Crown
of <HI>France</HI> out of Debt, is to be preferred to that of <HI>Henry</HI>
III. of <HI>France,</HI> who harassed his whole Kingdom, to build up four
or five great Fami∣lies, whereby he left behind him so many con∣spicuous
Monuments of his Folly and Weak∣ness. And our King <HI>James</HI> I. followed
the Measures of <HI>Henry</HI> III. in his most extravagant Bounties, which
caused the then Lord Treasu∣rer to put upon a long Table, where the King
was to pass by that Morning, a large Sum of Money in Silver, which the King
had given to one of his Favourites the Night before: The King being much
surprized with the Sight, (having never seen so much Money before
to∣gether) asked the Treasurer, who was behind him, what that Money was
for? who said, it was for such a Person, naming him to whom the King had
given it: To which the King presently replied (with his usual Oath) it was
much more than any Man could deserve from him, and commanded the Treasurer
to pay him only one Quarter of it. This made the King more careful of his
future Bounties; tho' I may truly say, that this King (tho' to his own
Pre∣judice) had more Compassion of other Mens Necessities, than of his
own Coffers; for, in Li∣berality, he exceeded, by many Degrees, all the 
<PB N="23" REF="44"/> Kings that ever went before him: And it had been much
better for King <HI>Charles,</HI> his Succes∣sor, if his Liberality had not
been so great; for by that means, he left his Successor much indebted,
which prov'd infinitely prejudicial both to the King and Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now, whosoever hath read King <HI>James</HI>'s Works, will find
therein most rational and po∣litick Discourses of the Nature of
Government, and the good Temper of the <HI>English</HI> Monarchy, where there
is no unnatural Swelling of Power, nor Liberty; for these two are like Heat
and Moisture, where they are well mix'd, every thing prospers, but where
they are single, they are destructive; and our true lawful Govern∣ment in
<HI>England</HI> is like our Climate, where there are sometimes unquiet loud
Winds, which, tho' troublesome, yet they clear the Air, and much of Mens
Healths is owing to them. Ab∣solute Power is a Plant that will not grow up∣on
<HI>English</HI> Ground; those who have attempted to cultivate it in that
Soil, have hastned their own Ruine. All Men must confess, that King
<HI>James</HI>'s Discourses in Parliaments were admira∣ble, but the
practical Part was wanting; for his remiss and loose Government was a great
Cause of our following Disorders: For, finding no Money could be raised,
to supply his Necessi∣ties, and extravagant Bounties, but by Parlia∣ment,
he therefore still caressed them, thinking that Way to prevent the ill
Humour, which lay in the Stomach of the Nation, which then be∣gan to shew it
self more publickly; and he <PB N="24" REF="45"/> would often say, he was
but One King, that, in his House of Commons, were near Five Hun∣dred; and
whilst he liv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> his Presbyterian Subjects so much
teazed, and so often imprisoned him, that he had as good al∣most been one
of the Kings of <HI>Brentford,</HI> as King of <HI>Scotland.</HI> However, this
King, con∣tented with those Dominions which he had by an undisputed
Succession, coveted nothing more from his Neighbours, nor had other
Thoughts or Wishes, besides those of the common Peace and Repose of
Christendom, and had therefore a just Motto given to his Arms, <HI>Beati
Pacifici.</HI> He had so much Cunning, that he still held well with his
Parliaments, and desired to be beloved, rather than feared by them: For
Pow∣er, without Love, hath a terrifying Aspect, and the Worship paid to it,
is like that which the <HI>Indians</HI> give, out of Fear, to wild Beasts and
Devils. And as he that fears God, only because he is Almighty, wishes there
was no God; so he that fears the King, only because he can punish,
wishes there was no King; and therefore a King cannot take too much Care to
keep himself up: For if a King lets his People slip from him, he is no
longer really their King, but the People may let a King fall, and still
re∣main a People.</P>
<P>In this Conjuncture, after Twenty Two Years peaceably reigning in
<HI>England,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> I. died, leaving his Son, then King
<HI>Charles,</HI> his Successor, ingag'd in a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> by
Ad∣vice of Parliament, without Supplies to sup∣port <PB N="25" REF="46"/> it,
and left his own Debts great, by his immoderate Bounty; to which a great
Addition was made, upon King <HI>Charles</HI>'s coming first to the Crown,
and many Inconveniencies were then submitted to, for Supply, contrary to
for∣mer Laws; and Miscarriages in Government escaped in the Beginning of
this King's Reign, which happened thro' the ill Counsel of some Men,
driving on their own private Ends, and the Peevishness of some others,
envying the Publick should be managed without them, join'd with the
insuperable Necessities of State, rather than from any Propensity in
the King, who was free from any Injuriousness, or Op∣pression of his
People.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was at this time received into an
admired Intimacy and Dearness by the King, and a Marriage was soon
conclu∣ded with the Princess <HI>Henrietta Maria</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and
the Duke was sent thither to con∣duct her to the King. A little after this a
Par∣liament was called, the House of Commons, upon their first
Assembly, pressed for Redress of Grievances, and against
Recusants, and they gave the King two Subsidies, which did not answer his
Wants and Expectations, nor at all satisfy; and the King finding the
Parliament more stiff than he expected, he soon dissolved them; that
sowre Humour against Kingly Pre∣rogative being then very predominant in the
House of Commons; and the Duke, who, in the last Parliament of King
<HI>James,</HI> was stiled, The Saviour of the People, in bringing Home 
<PB N="26" REF="47"/> the then Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> was now called, The
Destroyer of the People, and more cry'd down, than he was before cry'd up,
and was named, the Corrupter of the King, and principal Cause of all
Disorder, who had betrayed the Subjects Liberties, and his ill Management was
made the Pretext for not assisting the King in Parlia∣ment, as the State
of the King's Affairs then required; who used all possible Means to
satis∣fy a discontented People, but could not. The late Parliament, before
their Dissolution, de∣clared, the King had sent Ships into
<HI>France,</HI> to assist the <HI>French</HI> King against his
Protestant Subjects at <HI>Rochel,</HI> which was by the Duke's Interest,
without acquainting the Council of State, which much exasperated the People,
who complain'd, that the Duke had not made the Match with <HI>Spain,</HI> out
of a particular Spleen against the <HI>Conde d'Olivares,</HI> and had made it
with <HI>France,</HI> upon much harder Terms.</P>
<P>The Duke being hereupon questioned in Par∣liament, made a
plausible Answer: However, the House of Commons resolved against any
farther Supply (except the two Subsidies they had given) without Redress of
Grievances. After the Dissolution of this first Parliament, some
provisional Acts of State were made, to supply the Defects in Law, and a
Proclama∣tion was published against Catholicks, to give the People some
Satisfaction, and a Fleet was sent out by the Duke against <HI>Cadiz,</HI>
but retur∣ned with ill Success.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="48"/>In <HI>February</HI> following, a second
Parliament was called, and the King was soon after crowned. The Lord Keeper
then made a Speech to the Parliament, declaring the King's Love to them,
striving whether he should be a greater King, or a better Man; and that
they were called to make good Laws, and execute Justice. The House of
Commons presently fell upon Grie∣vances, the Miscarriage of the
<HI>Cadiz</HI> Voyage, the Misemployment of the King's Revenue, and reflected
much upon the Duke, and several bold Speeches were made against him, and
great Animosities still continued betwixt the Duke and the Earl of
<HI>Bristol.</HI> The King demands of the Parliament a present Supply, and
desired they would rather redress, than inquire into Grievances. The
House of Commons exhibi∣ted Articles against the Duke, desiring he might
have no more Access to the King, and agreed upon a Remonstrance against
the Duke, and pray'd the King not to dissolve them. The Duke being much
transported with this Usage, prevailed with the King to dissolve them,
and fell into such Anger against some principal Members, that they were
imprisoned or disgra∣ced soon after Dissolution. From this time the
People were generally apprehensive of an arbi∣trary Government, and were much
unsatisfied with the excessive Greatness of the Duke, who had a greater
Ascendant upon his new Master, the present King, than upon his
Predecessor; which was much wondred at, that the same Person should
be the prime Favourite both to <PB N="28" REF="49"/> Father and Son, which bred
a great Distemper of Humours in the Court, which soon descen∣ded into the
Country, and the Displeasure to the Favourite soon seized their Duty to
their Prince. Kings raise some Men so high, as to over-top All, and keep
them under; but it is dangerous to bestow too much upon one Man, for there is
no Man fitting to be a King, but he that is a King; and when Kings are
immo∣derate in bestowing their Power, it many times brings much Woe to the
People, much Danger to the Person in Power, and not seldom, much Sorrow to
the King himself: And a wise Prince will not oblige his Courtiers, who are
Birds of Prey, to disoblige his Subjects, who are Beasts of Burthen. It was
indeed look'd upon as a rare Felicity, and seldom known, that the Duke
should be in greater Favour with the Son, than he was with the Father: For,
the new King, from the Death of the old King, even to the Death of the Duke
himself, discover'd the most entire Confidence, and even Friendship, to
the Duke, that ever King shewed to any Subject; all Preferments were given by
him; all his Friends and Kindred to that Degree in Honour, Riches, or Offices,
as the Duke thought fit; all his Enemies discountenanced, as he appointed:
But it was strange, that he should so suddenly fall, from the
greatest Heighth of popular Esti∣mation, to the lowest Depth of Calumny
and Reproach, by perswading the King to dissolve Parliaments, which
proved most pernicious to the Duke himself; for, in the first Parliament 
<PB N="29" REF="50"/> of this King, tho' most of the same Persons were
chosen, who so passionately adhered to him be∣fore, the Affection they
had then for him, even of the same Men, was turned into Animosity against
him, and that in so high a Nature, that all the Actions of his Life were ript
up, Votes and Remonstrances passed against him, as an Enemy to the
Publick, and his ill managing of the King's Grace and Favour to him, made the
Ground of their Refusal to give the King that Supply which he expected, and
was highly ne∣cessary for the King, in that Conjuncture. Here all the
People's Discontents were laid up∣on the Duke, in respect of the mighty
Share he had in his Majesty's Favour and Affection, and that he managed his
Power, to the Eclipse of all other great Men, and moulded the Court to the
Advantage principally of his own Family, thinking thereby to strengthen
himself (instead of endeavouring to mollify the Misunderstan∣dings
betwixt the King and his People, which was his true Interest:) But the Duke's
Want of Experience, having never seen or felt the Re∣verse of Fortune, made
him too great an En∣terprizer, to succeed in what he so unadvisedly
undertook, and so precipitately, and for his own Satisfaction; and, upon his
single Discon∣tent, first ran the late King into a War with
<HI>Spain,</HI> which proved both fruitless and bur∣thensome to him. And
thus the Throne was endanger'd by him, whose Obligation and true Interest
it was to uphold it; and King <HI>Charles</HI> did not only succeed to his
Royal Father's <PB N="30" REF="51"/> Crown, but Troubles, who was left involved
in most strange Intrigues and Difficulties, the Counsels of his
Ministers being not then con∣ducted according to those Rules and Measures
of Policy, which the Circumstances and Necessities of the King's Affairs
required; which, if they had been well managed, had easily prevented the
cruel Rebellion which afterwards followed.</P>
<P>Thus we see Princes cannot be secure, when leading Men in
their own Courts fall into Fa∣ction; and when there is most need of Concord
and Unity, Mens Minds are then most disuni∣ted, and, contrary to ancient
Prudence, when <HI>England</HI> wanted the best, the worst Men were set
at the Head of Business; and our then most unhappy King, was, by
Diversity of Counsels, drawn oftentimes from his own Judgment, (which was
better than theirs) and was forced many times to court those he hated, and to
frown upon those, whose Abilities and faithful Services to the Crown he
secretly approved; which is usually the Fate of such Princes who are
drawn into Streights, either by their Pre∣decessors, or their own
Negligence; and at this time the greatest Part of the King's Counsel where
wholly taken up in the Improvement of their own Fortunes, or Gratification of
their Pleasures which they earnestly affected, and had so much to do for
themselves, that they wholly neglected the King's Affairs, and those which
were most able, were frighted from meddling in them; and when those
Ministers, whose Steadiness of Judgment, and Directness 
<PB N="31" REF="52"/> of Application to their Master's and the King∣dom's
Honour and Advantage, estrange them∣selves from Court, it abates Mens
Confidence in the successful Course of Affairs.</P>
<P>The King being put to these Streights, Ton∣nage and Pondage were
levied by Order from the Board, and likewise Loan Money and Be∣nevolence
taken; and the Duke finding the King somewhat unsatisfied with the
<HI>French</HI> King, and that the Queen's Servants were sending Home, his
Grace soon changed the Scene, and caused the King to declare War against
<HI>France,</HI> and went in Person to the Isle of <HI>Rhee,</HI> to
assist the <HI>Rochellers</HI> against their King; but he was there
defeated, and this Repulse was more un∣fortunate than that of <HI>Cadiz.</HI>
But, in <HI>March</HI> following, another Parliament was call'd, and the King
spake to them, to expedite Business, shewed them the common Danger,
moved for a Supply, and told them plainly, if they did not do their Duty, he
should be obliged to use other Mea∣sures, which would not be so
pleasing to them: But however, the House of Commons fell upon Grievances,
before Supply, and after many Debates, and some Conferences, the Petition of
Right was setled by Act of Parliament, and several other Acts passed,
and then the Parlia∣ment was prorogued till <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>In this Interval the Duke resolved upon a second Attempt
against <HI>France,</HI> and was prepa∣ring for it at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI>
but was prevented by his sudden Murder, which gave the King much Sorrow and
Trouble: And as the Duke, during <PB N="32" REF="53"/> Life, was unfortunate in
publick Affairs, so his sudden Death produced a Change in all Counsels;
it being first generally agreed, that the King should make a Peace with
both Crowns, since the War could not be carried on without Supplies, and the
Parliament was far∣ther prorogued, till <HI>January,</HI> which was ill taken.
And Kings of <HI>England</HI> will never do well, to fence with the
Inclinations of their Parliaments, or Discontents of their People; they
must shew they have no other Interests, but those of their Subjects in
general; for Par∣tiality in a Prince produces Heart-Burnings, to see some
few lifted up high, wallowing in Wealth and Pleasures, while the People groan
under heavy Taxes. A Government is never well establish'd but in the Hearts
of the Sub∣jects, nor so hard to be shaken, as when the Generality of the
People, as well as the Nobi∣lity, are intirely satisfied; which they will
ne∣ver be, till they see Men chosen into Offices, by being fit for them,
and continued for dischar∣ging well, and rewarded for extraordinary Me∣rit,
and punished for remarkable Faults. In such Cases, the King discharges
the Severity of all Punishments upon the Parliament, and com∣mits no Force
upon the Gentleness of his own Nature, when his Subjects see, that no
Ten∣derness of their Prince, nor Corruption of his Ministers, can
preserve them from paying what they owe to any Forfeits of their Duty; nor
indeed can any Prince do Justice to those that serve him well, without
punishing those that <PB N="33" REF="54"/> serve him ill, since that is
to make their Con∣ditions equal, whose Deserts are different. And therefore
Kings should not only consent to, but encourage any Inquiries a Parliament
shall make into the Miscarriages of Ministers, and join willingly with
them therein: But whether, at that Time that the Parliament would have
questioned the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> they did then proceed from a
steady Intention of a general Good, or from some particular Animosities
against the Duke, or from some accidental Distempers, from which the
greatest and best Assemblies are not always free, is still a great
Question; especially when such Assem∣blies have continued long
together: For then they will spy out, and look after Miscarriages and
Grievances, rather than supply their law∣ful King and Sovereign. 'Tis
certainly true, when Kings of <HI>England</HI> meet often with their
Parliaments, and agree with them, they may command what they please: But if a
King's Revenue be such, as to enable him to live without his Parliament, he
will be more free; for the Meeting and long Sitting of Parliaments is
dangerous; for usually, when publick Busi∣ness is ended (nay, many times
before they have ended it) they fall upon Grievances, and enter into Factions,
to the great Prejudice of both King and Kingdom (as hath been often seen) and
therefore <HI>Posning</HI>'s Law was a good Pro∣vision against long
Sitting of Parliaments. However, when Parliaments resolve to go upon
Grievances, Kings should never interpose, to <PB N="34" REF="55"/> secure
their Favourites from answering Crimes which are alledged against them in
Parliament, as was intended against the Duke, before the Parliament was
prorogued; for it lays an Im∣putation upon the Prince, as being privy to their
Actions, and fixes also a Scandal upon the Person accused, that he is
generally thought guilty of all things laid to his Charge. And this Course,
which was taken in the Beginning of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Government, of
Proroguing and Dissolving Parliaments, rendred the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Power more formidable, be∣cause it was thought
unlimited; and tho' he was esteemed but as an Idol set up by King
<HI>James,</HI> and was therefore more contemptible to the People; yet, at the
same time, they thought the present King stood in Awe of him, and was
afraid to pull down that Favourite, who was grown so formidable by his Power,
and the Number of his Followers and Adhe∣rents; but such top-heavy Buildings,
which have no solid Foundation in them, of Merit, are soon blown down; and
let bad Men have never so much seeming Greatness and Power, they are
seldom dangerous to wise Princes, who will never hinder them from being
brought to Punishment, by a timely Sacrifice; and no Man ever yet saw a
Tumult to defend them. And if this great Favourite, the Duke, had not been so
soon murdered, he had certainly been made a Victim to the Publick, by the
Parliament. And when this Parliament met in <HI>January,</HI> they were very
troublesome, fell upon Grievan∣ces, <PB N="35" REF="56"/> and made some
Assaults against the Prero∣gative, and were preparing some
Accusations against the Lord Treasurer <HI>Weston:</HI> And tho' the
King sent the Black Rod for the Commons, to come to the House of Lords,
they locked the Door of their House, and not only refused Entrance to the
Black Rod, but forced the Speaker to his Chair, till they had adjourned the
House to a Day, thinking thereby not to be dissolved before the Day of
their Adjourn∣ment. However, the King went in Person to the House of Lords,
without calling the Com∣mons, and dissolved the Parliament, affirming, that
some Vipers in the House of Commons, were the Cause of his dissolving
them, and at the same time very much courted and commen∣ded the Lords; and,
after this Dissolution, some of those Members who had carried
them∣selves very insolently, were committed to seve∣ral Prisons, and
the King, to satisfy his People, published a Proclamation, shewing the
Causes of dissolving those three Parliaments.</P>
<P>In the Year 1630, Prince <HI>Charles</HI> was born, at whose
Birth great Rejoicing was thro' the whole Kingdom; and in 1633, the King went
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was there Crowned with great Solemnity. At his
Return, in 1634, Ship-Money was raised with great Care and Equality, by
Letters written from the Privy-Council to every High-Sheriff; and tho' this
Pill was gilded, it would not be swallowed, but great Discontents were
express'd at an Imposition never before practised, and against Law: But
yet this was <PB N="36" REF="57"/> done by the Advice and solemn Agreement of
all the Judges, (except two, <HI>Hatton</HI> and <HI>Crook</HI>) who argued
against it. However, they subscri∣bed for the King's doing it; neither
did the Judges do so much in this, as was done in the Parliament of 31
<HI>H.</HI> VIII. when it was agreed, that the Legislative Power should be
in the King and his Council, in Intervals of Parliament; and that the King's
Proclamation should be of equal Force with an Act of Parliament: And this was
thought fit by the Parliament, as being a dangerous thing, that the King
should be at Disadvantage, for Want of Power, in Case of sudden
Exigencies. And therefore there was Reason, that the King should steer
with a shor∣ter Rudder, that his Care might meet with every Turn of
Providence, which might otherwise suddenly overturn the good Government of
the Nation: And it was then also declared in Par∣liament, that if the Motions
at home should wait upon the Debates in Parliament, things must needs come
short in Execution, and the Affairs of the Nation extremely suffer. And
tho' this was but a temporary Law, during the then present Condition of
Affairs; yet, in the 34 and 35 of the same King, another Law was made to
confirm what was done before, with a Power granted to the King and Council, to
change and alter, as they should think fit. And certainly the same Reason
held as strong, du∣ring the troublesome and impetuous Reign of King
<HI>Charles,</HI> tho' he thought not convenient to demand any such Power.
<HI>The Opinion of</HI> <PB N="37" REF="58"/> <HI>the Judges was subscribed
in these Words fol∣lowing.</HI></P>
<Q>We are of Opinion, that when the Good and Safety of the Kingdom in
general is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in Danger, your Maje∣sty may by
Writ, under the Great Seal of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> command all your Subjects of
this King∣dom, at their Charge, to provide and furnish such Number of
Ships, with Men, Victuals, and Ammunition, and for such Time as your
Majesty shall think fit, for the Defence and Safeguard of the Kingdom, from
such Peril and Danger; and that, by the Law, your Majesty may compel the
doing hereof; and, in Case of Refusal, or Refractoriness, we are also
of Opinion, that your Majesty is the sole Judge, both of the Danger, and
when and how the same is to be prevented and avoided.</Q>
<P>The King did nothing herein, but what he was advised to do by
his Judges, who were al∣ways esteemed the King's learned Council in the Law;
and if any thing was amiss in this Particular, the Advisers were to
answer for it, which they did, and some of them were suffici∣ently
punished for it: But whether they were punished deservedly, or not, is
yet a Question. Soon after the King's Return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> Bishop
<HI>Laud</HI> succeeded Archbishop <HI>Abbot</HI> in the See of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> who being very powerful with the King, advised the
Setling the Church Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it was in
<HI>England,</HI> that there might be an Uniformity of Church Discipline in
both Kingdoms; and the King <PB N="38" REF="59"/> sent down his Orders
accordingly, with a new Service Book of Common-Prayer, with Com∣mand to be read
in all the Churches: But ma∣licious and designing Men, who desire
Innova∣tions in State, do most commonly begin their first Attempt upon the
Church, as was seen in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by their Commotions upon this
Occa∣sion, when they were, at that time, by God's Mercy to us, and the King's
Care over us, in perfect Peace with all the Nations upon Earth. The King, by
the Marquess of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> his Commissioner, did all he could to
quiet those Troubles; yet nothing would do, for the <HI>Scots</HI> made a
Covenant together, and declared never to renounce it, but prepared for War; and
from thence sprung the true Fountain of all our en∣suing Miseries in
<HI>England.</HI> This kind of Presby∣terian Government, which was then
established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had found good Reception in some of the
<HI>Gallican</HI> and <HI>Belgian</HI> Churches, and which <HI>Beza</HI> used
his utmost Endeavours to plant in <HI>England:</HI> But wary Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> stood fix'd, and could not be brought to any
Unsettlement of the ancient Discipline of Epis∣copacy: But in
<HI>Scotland</HI> this new Form prospe∣red, by the Artifices of
<HI>Buchanan</HI> and <HI>Knox,</HI> and during King <HI>James</HI>'s Minority,
they threw down Bishops, and setled Presbytery, and used their King as
they pleased.</P>
<P>About this Time, the short Parliament of 1640 drew near; the
King being then at <HI>York,</HI> was preparing to return to <HI>London.</HI>
It was then considered, whether the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> 
<PB N="39" REF="60"/> should stay with the Army, or go with the King to
<HI>London.</HI> The Earl shewed many substantial Reasons for his not
going, and knowing how much the <HI>Scots</HI> were incensed against him,
and how great an Interest they would have in the Parliament: That, by his
Absence, he would not be so much in their Mind; and that if any thing
should be objected against him, he might the better avoid, and retire from
any Danger, and be better able to do the King Service else∣where, when the
King's Occasions should require it (as he much feared they would;) but no
Ar∣guments could prevail, but the King continued earnest for his going with
him, and assured him in the Word of a King, if he should be questioned,
he would so defend him, that a Hair of his Head should not be touched; and
so the Earl resolved to submit to the King's Commands, tho' he foresaw
his own Destruction in it.</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1640, the Parliament met, when
<HI>Glanville</HI> was chosen Speaker. A Message was soon sent by the
King to the House of Commons, for Supplies, shewing the intolerable
Indignities and Injuries of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who had not only common Ties of
Nature, Sovereignty, and Bounty upon that Nation, with his late royal Father,
but had twice gratified the active Spi∣rit among them so far, that he had
preferred the Desires of that Party before his own Inte∣rest or Honour; and
his royal Bounty to them had emboldened them to ask and act beyond all Bounds
of Modesty and Gratitude, which made the King more scandalized at their
coming into <PB N="40" REF="61"/> <HI>England,</HI> contrary to his Will, and
with the Forfeiture of so many Obligations of Duty to him. It is true, that
when they first entered <HI>England,</HI> Success crowned their Work, being
thought a wise and resolute Nation, who, after an unbloody War, for above
one Year, returned laden with Spoils, and great Riches, and were most
liberally rewarded, as well for going out, as coming into <HI>England:</HI> But
God's Justice was in the End discovered through all their Preten∣tions of
Religion, in which they wrapt up their wicked Designs, who built their Piety
upon the Ruines of Loyalty, and made Bankrupt of their Allegiance, to set up
a quicker Trade for Re∣ligion. Upon this Account, the King (as he had good
Reason) was very angry with them, and declared, if the House of Commons
would assist him suitable to the Exigency of his Affairs, he would not
only quit his Claim to Ship-Mo∣ney, but would give them full Satisfaction in
all their just Demands; which Message was much approved by both Houses,
and many Con∣ferences were held, whether the Supply, or the Subjects Grievances
should precede. The Lords voted for the first, but the Commons for the
latter; however, the Difference was soon unhappily decided by a voluntary
Mistake in old Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> then Secretary of State, who was
ordered by the King and Council, to demand six Subsidies, and he demanded
twelve; which was so highly unreasonable, that many were much
displeased, but all were inclined to have given six, which was no usual
Gift.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="62"/>Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> escaped not without
great Censure, for demanding Double to his Com∣mission; but it was really
believed, this Mi∣stake was purposely done, to raise the House to
Animosities, which took Effect; for the House would not consent to what
he demanded, but insisted upon their Grievances, which made the King so
desperate, that he forthwith dissol∣ved the Parliament. The Counsel
given to dissolve them was generally disliked, because the Differences
between the King and this Par∣liament might have been cemented by the Lords,
and the <HI>Scots</HI> Troubles, by this Parliament, appeased, which grew
wider by this Breach; and the Odium of this was laid upon Archbi∣shop
<HI>Laud,</HI> who was thought to be more busy in temporal Matters, than he
ought; and be∣ing too full of Fire (tho' a just, good Man) his too much Zeal
for the Church made him per∣swade the King to the Sitting of the Convoca∣tion
(which ought not to have been done) af∣ter Dissolution of the Parliament.
The King then caused a Guard to be set about <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
while the Convocation sat, who setled the Discipline of the Church, and
would not alter the Government by Bishops, and they granted a Benevolence to
the King, of Four Shillings in the Pound, for six Years, towards his
Expe∣dition against the <HI>Scots,</HI> wherein the Archbi∣shop was very
active. The <HI>Scots</HI> were at this time come into a warmer Climate than
their own, and Petitioned the King for Redress of their Grievances, in
several Articles. All good <PB N="42" REF="63"/> Men inveighed sufficiently
against them, whilst others approved of their Proceedings. There was at
this time a strange Spirit of Division in the Opinions of Men, of these
Affairs; too many not only favouring, but joining with the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Covenanters, who presented their De∣mands, How their Army should be
maintained, till the Treaty was ended, and Peace secured; and so they had a
great Allowance: But the King's best Subjects said, the King should
rather have put All to the Issue of a Battle, than to give such Terms to
most rebellious Subjects. But the King saw plainly, that divers Officers of
his own Army, and even the private Soldi∣ers, had no Mind to fight against
the <HI>Scots,</HI> which made the King conclude the Treaty with them. The Earl
of <HI>Montrose,</HI> who had great Alliances in <HI>Scotland,</HI> came then
into <HI>England,</HI> to serve the King, but by the Marquess of
<HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Cunning, (who betrayed the King in all the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Affairs) <HI>Montrose</HI> was slighted and neglected, whereupon he went
back to the Covenanters; but being soon weary of them, he wrote to the King,
professing his great Loy∣alty and Service to his Majesty; which Letter
was taken out of the King's Pocket at Night, by the Marquess of
<HI>Hamilton,</HI> and sent to the Covenanters.</P>
<P>About this Time, a Resolution was taken by the King and Council,
to call another Parlia∣ment, the great Necessity of the King's Affairs then
obliging him to it. The Court Party la∣boured much to bring in their Friends,
but <PB N="43" REF="64"/> those that were most esteemed at Court, had
least Respect and Interest in the Country; and it was not a little
strange to see, what a Spirit of Opposition was in the Hearts of most
Men, to the Court's Proceeding: So that very few of the King's Party were
chosen Members of Par∣liament. And indeed the highest Danger in
<HI>England</HI> comes from the Power of the People to elect their
Representatives; for they will be such as are of their own Complexion, and
which will stand by them in all their Designs against the Government, for
clipping the Wings of Monarchy, and restraining the King's lawful
Prerogative; which was the true Reason why the King broke so many
Parliaments; but at last being wearied, and overborne, he was
necessita∣ted to give Way to their Meeting in 1641, which, by several
Encroachments upon the Royal Prerogative, their long Sitting, and Suc∣cess in
their Rebellion, brought their lawful Sovereign at last to the Block, as will
be seen in the Sequel of these <HI>Memoirs.</HI></P>
<P>This Long Parliament was convened to meet <HI>November</HI> 3.
1641. a most ominous Day! for the Parliament met that Day, in 20 <HI>H.</HI>
VIII. which began with the Fall of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey</HI>; and therefore
Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> was desired to get their Meeting adjourned for
some Days: But the good Man took no Notice of those things. At their
first Meeting, the King told them, he was resolved to put himself freely
upon the Love and Affection of his Subjects, and left it intirely to them,
where to begin, <PB N="44" REF="65"/> promising them Redress of Grievances,
and de∣sired that all Suspicion of each other should be laid aside. The
House of Commons, after establishing Committees, fell upon Grievances,
and many sharp Speeches were made upon that Subject. The King passed the
Bill for the Tri∣ennial Parliament, and thereby declared his great Confidence
in them, and the extraordina∣ry Favour he did his Subjects, by passing that
Bill. The House of Commons fell presently upon the Earl of
<HI>Strafford,</HI> whom they accu∣sed of High Treason, and desired he
might be secured, which was done accordingly, and great Preparations made for
his Trial in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> before the Lords; and one of the
sharpest Managers of the Evidence against his Lordship, says, That
<HI>No Man ever acted a Part on such a Theatre with more Wisdom,
Elo∣quence, and Constancy, and with greater Reason, Judgment and Temper,
and with a better Grace,</HI> than that great Lord and excellent Person did,
so that he moved the Hearts of all his Auditors (some few excepted) to
great Pity and Remorse. His Lordship told them, it was hard that
Pu∣nishment should precede Promulgation of a Law; to be punished by a Law
subsequent to the Fact, was never heard of till that time; that there
should no Mark be set, by which the Offence might be known, no
Admonish∣ment given to avoid it, was a Case extreme hard. The King heard
all the Tryal, and after went to the House of Lords, and sent for the
Commons, and did passionately desire the Par∣liament <PB N="45" REF="66"/>
not to proceed severely against the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI>
assuring them in the Word of a Christian, that he could not in
Conscience con∣demn him, and added, that neither Fear, nor any other
Respect, should make him go against his Conscience. However, the Bill
of Attain∣der passed both Houses, and a Bill not to pro∣rogue, adjourn,
or dissolve the Parliament, without Consent of both Houses. Thus, when
Men seek to limit and confine the King to their Reason, they must needs
have a secret Aim to share with him, or usurp upon him in his Pow∣er and
Dominion: For good Men in Parliament will propose nothing to their King, nor
expect any thing from their King, but what he will be as ready to give them, as
they are to receive from him.</P>
<P>The King was much perplexed at the sending to him these two
Bills, and sent for some of his Bishops, and others of his intimate
Counsel∣lours, to have their Advice what Measures to take, who advised
him to pass the Bills: And the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> being informed of
the King's great Perplexity, wrote to the King, de∣siring him to pass the
Bill against him, saying, his Consent would acquit the King before
Al∣mighty God. Whereupon the King passed the Bill, and sent Mr. Secretary
<HI>Carleton,</HI> to ac∣quaint the Earl with it, who not believing, without
some Astonishment, that the King would have passed the Bill, he
rose from his Chair, and lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, clapp'd his Hand upon
his Breast, and said with some <PB N="46" REF="67"/> Passion, <HI>Put
not your Trust in Princes, nor in the Sons of Men, for there is no Truth in
them;</HI> which he had some Reason to say, because the King had
engaged him to come to <HI>London,</HI> con∣trary to his own Sentiment, and had
faithfully assured him, in the Word of a King, that in Case he should
be attack'd in Parliament, he would so defend him, that a Hair of his Head
should not be touched. And now by this un∣expected Message, he had Notice
given him of his Death, to which he really believed the King would never have
consented; which made him break out in that Expression, with some more
than ordinary Movement, believing his Letter to the King would have made him
more firm in his Resolution. Great Reflections were made upon the King's
passing these two Bills, the one against his most faithful Servant,
and the other against himself: The first took away the Life of that great
Statesman, the other his own Life, both Bills being signed at the same
Time, and with the same Pen. The King had great Remorse for what he had
done, and the next Day sent a Letter to the Lords written with his own Hand,
by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> to inter∣cede for the Earl's Life; but nothing
would prevail, tho' it was confidently affirmed by some, that the Earl's Life
was promised the King, to encourage him to pass the Bill: But now the Lords
would not consent to his Maje∣sty's Desire. And thus fell this noble
Earl, who, for natural Parts and Abilities, for Im∣provement of Knowledge, by
Experience in <PB N="47" REF="68"/> greatest Affairs; for Wisdom, Fidelity,
Obe∣dience, and Gallantry, left no Equal behind him. A little after this, to
satisfy the King in somewhat, the House of Commons granted an Act for
Tonnage and Pondage, which the King took before as due by his Prerogative, but
now as a Gift from his People.</P>
<P>The Parliament then adjourned till Winter, it being thought fit
the King should go into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> the People there beginning to
shew their Discontents more publickly, where the King being in Person
might better redress their Grie∣vances, as they call'd them. The King then
granted every thing they desired, without ask∣ing any Questions, till
they declared they had no more to ask, the King having entirely fulfil∣led
their Desires, and (as the Phrase then went) <HI>He parted, a contented
King, from a contented People.</HI> For, from the Time of the King's co∣ming
among them, he had fully complied with all they desired, both for the publick
Govern∣ment, and their private Advancements. The Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
within it self, enjoyed perfect Peace and Tranquillity, and the King was
confident, the Affections of the <HI>Scots</HI> could not be corrupted,
believing they were sensible of their former Breach of Duty, and willing to
repair it by any Service; and that their Gene∣ral, <HI>Lesly,</HI> had made
great Acknowledgments and Professions of Duty to his Majesty, and would
be always ready and willing to serve him. About the End of <HI>November</HI>
this Year, the King returned well satisfied from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was, 
<PB N="48" REF="69"/> upon his Arrival, most sumptuously entertained by
the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The King then went to the Parliament, and made a Speech to both
Houses, wherein he told them, he made as much Haste to them, as his Affairs
in <HI>Scotland</HI> permitted; and that he had left that Nation in a most
peaceable and con∣tented Condition: And yet he was no sooner gone from them,
but they subscribed their Co∣venant, raised an Army against their
lawful King, made <HI>Lesly</HI> their General, to join with their dear
Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> who were then hatching a Rebellion against
their King, who then told them in Parliament, That tho' he did not find
<HI>England</HI> so well setled as he expected, (being full of
Jealousies, and Alarms of De∣signs and Plots) yet he doubted not of his
Sub∣jects good Affections, by his Reception at his Return: And added, That he
was so far from repenting what he had done for them, that he was willing and
ready to pass any thing more, that might justly be desired, for their
Liberties, Properties, and Maintenance of their Religion; and desired them
not to be discontented at their own Happiness, nor to be without Sense of
their natural Allegiance: And that having got∣ten the Opinion of being good
Patriots for their Country, they should not be inveigled into Steps of
Disloyalty, nor to use such Measures as would disturb the Throne. The
King also re∣commended to them the Business of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where,
it seems a Rebellion broke out, during his Absence in <HI>Scotland</HI>;
and the King offered <PB N="49" REF="70"/> to go thither in Person, to
prosecute those Re∣bels, but the Parliament would not agree to it. Now, he
that governs three Kingdoms, com∣posed of three several Nations, whose
Religi∣on, Manners, and Language are different, and whose Passions and
Interests are contrary to each other, must keep a constant severe Hand
over them: For, to think of governing them, as King <HI>Charles</HI> I. did, by
a gentle and obliging Temper, was as impossible, as to think of put∣ting
six wild Horses to a Coach, and to drive them without Whip or Reins. And
whoever hath read the pious Meditations of King <HI>Charles,</HI> hath there
found by his own Words, that he condescended against his own Judgment and
Conscience, to settle Presbytery in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>; and it appeared
soon after, how unhap∣py this King was, in his too kind and tender
Condescensions to the <HI>Scots,</HI> which occasioned all those
Troubles he had in the North of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> The Presbyterians called
God to witness, that nothing was so dear to them, as the Honour and Safety
of the King, and at the same time they conspired against both. They
seemed won∣derfully sollicitous for his Life and Safety, when they were
complotting how to entrap him: They told us, their dear Liberties and
Proper∣ties hung upon the Thread of the King's Life, and yet, at that
Instant, they were resolved to cut that Thread off. But the good
Christians of old did not use this Method; they prayed for their Princes
and Governours, when most bar∣barously and unjustly provoked to the
contrary; <PB N="50" REF="71"/> so that no Christian died as a Rebel or
Traytor, in all the early Persecutions of Christianity, for several
Centuries. The Presbyterians made it their Business, by their libellous
Pamphlets, and other wicked Arts, not only to make the King's Government
odious, his faithful Subjects suspected, but also to excite a Hatred to
his Royal Person; and made use of the Name of <HI>Popery,</HI> to carry on
all their wicked Designs, being the common Engine they have always play'd
against the Government. For it hath been observed, that the Prerogative
never so suffered, no great Statesman was ever disgra∣ced, nor the
Liberties of the People ever wounded, but a dreadful Outcry of <HI>Popery</HI>
hath still preceded; and if any durst shew his Fidelity to Monarchy, by
opposing their Anti∣monarchical Projects, he was presently blasted with
the Name of a <HI>Court,</HI> or a <HI>Church Papist:</HI> And when they
could not undermine the Go∣vernment by Fraud, they would overthrow it by main
Force, and always had those in great Estimation, who made the biggest
Noise for Religion, and made no Scruple of involving three Kingdoms in
Misery and Confusion. They strained at Conformity, but swallowed down
Rebellion; they stumbled at the Rails before the Altar, but leap'd over
Dethroning their King, whom they murdered first in his Reputation, by calling
him Tyrant, (whose Fault was only his Clemency) and then they murdered him in
his Person.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="72"/>I remember well what <HI>Josephus</HI>
says in his <HI>Antiquities, Lib.</HI> 17. <HI>Cap.</HI> 3. That the
<HI>Pharisees</HI> were a bold Sect, that would swear Allegiance to
<HI>Caesar,</HI> but were inveterate Enemies to Kings, and would not stick
to make Attempts upon their Lives: And the Difference betwixt those
<HI>Pharisees</HI> and ours is, that they were <HI>Jewish</HI> Fanaticks,
and ours are Christian <HI>Jews,</HI> which appears by their Principles, who
say, the King holds not his Power <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> but is the People's
Trustee, and to them accountable: A Doctrine which leads to the Destruction
of all Kings. What our Blessed Saviour told his Dis∣ciples, that <HI>the
Times were coming, when they that killed them should think they did God good
Service,</HI> was seen about this Time, when Chur∣ches were pulled down for
God's Glory, when Religion was called <HI>Popery,</HI> and Monarchy
<HI>Tyranny</HI>; when Atheists would reform Religion, Bankrupts secure
Property, and Army Officers guard Liberty: When the Property of Nobi∣lity and
Gentry was held to be destructive of Liberty, and it was a dangerous thing
for Men to have any Sense of their Duty and Allegiance. But alas! those
that foment such Animosities and Divisions, do more Mischief to their
Coun∣try, than foreign Enemies. No Fears of Arbi∣trary Government can
justify, no Zeal for Re∣ligion can sanctify, such Proceedings. To live
and die with their King, is the highest Professi∣on a Subject can make,
and he serves his Coun∣try best, who well serves his King. And truly I am
perswaded, that many Men entred into <PB N="52" REF="73"/> our
<HI>English</HI> Rebellion, who little thought of any such thing, at their
first setting out, but were easily drawn in, by entering into the
So∣ciety of evil Men, and were not guilty of such black Intentions, and were
led away with the common Error and false Presumptions, that no∣thing was at
the Bottom, but to settle the true Interest of the Nation, and so fight
for the King and Parliament together, which they thought was their Duty; but
being once engaged, they went rashly farther than they at first intended:
But a true Christian Zeal will not suffer us to transgress the strict
Bounds of our Duty, both to God and the King, whatever flattering Pro∣spect
of Advantage it may give. <HI>Omne in prae∣cipiti vitium stetit:</HI> When
Men once espouse an ill Party, like those running down a Hill, they
cannot stop when they will; and I really believe, that some Proselytes
were made, who at first abhorred the Thoughts of Treason and Rebellion, but
were merely seduced by the Insi∣nuation and Address of some busy
Factors for Sedition and Rebellion: And therefore wise Men should take Care
of listning to any Suspi∣cion of their Prince, and not to hear with
Pleasure any scandalous Reflections of him; for he that can with Content
hear his King vilified, will soon think him not fit to be a King. And tho' we
do not think at first to be turning Re∣bels, yet whatsoever is at first
but a Tending to∣wards it, proves so at last, there being more Danger, that
the Beginnings of Vice should corrupt us, than any Hope that a sound
Dispo∣sition <PB N="53" REF="74"/> should correct the Influence of such
a Vice.</P>
<P>At this Time a great Diffidence began betwixt the Court and the
Country Party in Parliament, and the Disadvantage lay altogether on the
King's Side, who had then such Counsellours as did not do their Duty; and
so the Head and Members of our Monarchy entred into Distrust of each
other, which filled the Kingdom with Confusions, Miseries, and infinite
Desolations. The King had then no Counsellours about him, or at least did
not trust them that had the least Consideration for his Honour, or
Friendship for them that sat at the Helm of Affairs; and the King had no
Counsellours but those that made false Steps: There was no honest Man
that durst speak his Conscience to the King, for fear of his Ruine, and
those that the King thought most true to him, betrayed him every Hour; and
his very Whispers in his Bed-cham∣ber were presently conveyed to them
against whom those Whispers were: So that the King had very few to whom
he could breathe his Plaints, that were not suborned against him, or
averse to his Opinions: And that King can ne∣ver be a great Monarch, who hath
not just and wise Counsellours, by whom he must inform his Reason,
and guide his Actions, and use the Service and Industry of the best and
wisest Men.</P>
<P>It was about this Time that the Parliament avowed publickly that
the Power was entirely in them, and that the King being sever'd from 
<PB N="54" REF="75"/> them, had no Royal Power in him; and the House of
Commons did then petition the King touching their Privileges, declaring the
King ought to take no Notice of any Debate in either House of Parliament, but
by Information from them, nor be displeased with any Debate, be∣fore it was
presented to him; the Members of Parliament being the sole Judges of their
own Errors, in Matters depending before them. Many Members thought the Petition
was too rough, but the general Fate of things then drove that Way, to
increase the Jealousy be∣twixt the King and his People; and the Parlia∣ment
declared, they would not proceed in any Affairs, till they had a satisfactory
Answer to their Petition. The King, before any Answer given, withdraws to
<HI>Hampton Court,</HI> which in∣creases the Discontents in Parliament, who
sent a Committee to him at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> to tell the King plainly,
that the whole Frame of Go∣vernment was out of Order, and a Remon∣strance was
prepared by the Parliament, very roughly penn'd, both for Matter and
Expressi∣ons in it, wherein were mentioned all the Mi∣stakes,
Misfortunes, Illegalities, and Defaults of Government, with an Enumeration of
all Grievances, and not one single Error in Go∣vernment omitted, nor any
passionate Exercise of Power, from the Death of King <HI>James,</HI> till
that time; and that they had no Hopes of set∣ling the Distractions of the
Kingdom, by rea∣son of the evil Counsellours, and malignant Party that were
about the King. And when this <PB N="55" REF="76"/> Remonstrance was read in
the House, some mo∣derate Members did then protest against it, and were
sent to the <HI>Tower</HI> for it, but they were soon after released.
Soon after this, the King came again to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and being informed,
that some Members of Parliament had private Meetings and Correspondence
with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and countenanced the late Tumults, which came from the
City to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and which caused the King's Removal to
<HI>Hampton Court:</HI> The King, upon this Information, gave a War∣rant to
seal up their Trunks, Studies, and Pa∣pers; upon which the Commons having
Notice, passed several Votes against it, and justified their Members.
Whereupon the King exhibi∣ted Articles against the five Members (which were
named) for endeavouring to subvert the fundamental Laws and Government, and
to deprive the King of his Regal Power. The King taking Notice, that the
House of Com∣mons would defend their Members, went sud∣denly the next
Morning, with his Guard of Pensioners, entered the House of Commons,
stept into the Speaker's Chair, and look'd round the House for the Members,
who having had Notice of the King's Coming, were gone; the King said, he was
sorry for the Occasion of his Coming thither, having sent the Day before
a Sergeant at Arms to apprehend some that were accused of High Treason,
whereunto he expe∣cted Obedience (and not a Message, as they had sent
him) and he said, no King was ever more careful of their Privileges; but,
that <PB N="56" REF="77"/> in Cases of High-Treason, no Person had a
Privilege; and therefore commanded the Spea∣ker to send them to him; who
replied, that he had neither Eyes to see, nor Tongue to speak in that
Place, but as the House should direct him: And so the King returned to
<HI>Whitehall.</HI> This Action of the King's was look'd upon as a great Breach
of their Privileges, and was judged extreamly prejudicial to the King, and much
to his Enemies Advantage, and was thought ve∣ry strange by those who had
any Knowledge in publick Affairs, that the King was advised to so an
intemperate an Action, and many Excuses were made for it, and said it was
done by Wo∣mens Counsel, that the King should not suffer himself to be
so baffled, which provoked him to it. Many of the King's Friends resented
his going to the House, as a Motion rising rather from Passion than
Reason, being not guided with such Discretion as the Touchiness of
those Times required. Upon this the House of Commons frame a Declaration,
That the King's Coming to the House in a warlike Manner, to the Terror of the
Parliament, was a high Breach of their Privileges, and inconsistent with
their Liberty, and that they could not sit safely without a Guard, for
which they had been Suitors to the King, but could not obtain it. Upon this
great Tumults were in the City, and at <HI>Westminster</HI>; and as the
King went through the City, great Tumults flocked about his Coach, beseeching
him to agree with his Parliament. The King being in Danger of these Tumults,
was coun∣selled <PB N="57" REF="78"/> to remove again to <HI>Hampton
Court,</HI> which he did, and took with him the Queen, Prince of
<HI>Wales,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York</HI>; which was much wondred at by
prudent Men, that the King should leave the Place of his Residence, which
brought great Disadvantage upon himself and his Affairs. But the Fear of
those with him, and his own Fears for them, occasioned by the Tumults, with
the Hopes, that, by his Absence, the Heat of the Parliament might in some
Measure abate, were alledged, to ex∣cuse his Majesty's Retiring. But, on
the other Side, no Reason can be given for Rebellion, but Pretences; for
where Monarchy is setled, as in <HI>England,</HI> the Respect due to it
could not be violated, without being guilty of a kind of Sacrilege; it being
not only a Resemblance of that Power which God hath given the King, but a
Participation of that Power which none can resist, without the Breach of
God's Com∣mand. But People, at this time, were willing to be led blindfold by
their own Representa∣tives, rather than be guided by their Prince; and a few
subtle Heads in a House of Commons are dangerous, when they oppose the
Royal Autho∣rity, and are backed by the Multitude. Some Men softly instill
the Venom of their Princi∣ples, and bring about their Ends, by insinua∣ting
themselves into publick Affairs, and their Complaints sometimes seem
plausible, that they may gain Proselytes to their Faction, who may not mean
so ill as their Leaders do. For, with what plausible Pretences were many
Thousands <PB N="58" REF="79"/> first engaged in the War against King
<HI>Charles!</HI> What more plausible, than to engage in a War for the
Defence of King and Parliament! It is the Constitution of our Government, and
we were happy, if we had well understood it, where our Laws are propounded by
our selves in Parliament, and ratified by our Kings, which is our proper
Freedom, as <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and from the due Execution of those Laws
arises our Safety: But cunning and ambitious Men in the House of Commons,
who framed the Platform of all our Miseries, fixed the odious Name of
<HI>Malignants</HI> upon all those that adhered to the King, and the known
Laws, and who would not run to the same Excess of Madness and Re∣bellion
with them. And I well remember the time, when Parliament Soldiers plundered the
Houses, and took away the Horses of honest Countrymen, who liv'd
peaceably at Home, only because they were call'd Malignants, and that Name
did warrant the Plunder. The Ef∣fects of these Complaints brought that Civil
War upon us in 1641; and the Decoy to en∣gage Men then was, to fight for King
and Par∣liament, but the War ended in the Ruine of both, when Subjects bathed
their Swords in the Blood of their King; a Murder committed by the Mockery of
Justice, never to be forgot∣ten, and yet never to be mentioned, without
Horror and Detestation! 'Tis true, that Offen∣ces are given and taken in all
Governments; Kings sit uneasy on their Thrones, where their People are
tumultuous, and Religion is disgra∣ced; <PB N="59" REF="80"/> and God hath
exercised our <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion with a various Face of Afflictions
in the last Age: Our Fears and Jealousies did even anticipate our
Miseries, and we oftentimes brought real Miseries upon our selves, by
hast∣ning to prevent the fancied ones. But when cunning Men design
against the Government they live under, 'tis plain they would be Go∣vernours
themselves, and they murmur at Mer∣cies, as <HI>Israel</HI> did at
<HI>Manna,</HI> and their Hearts open and shut according to their own Rules,
when they strain at Gnats, and swallow Ca∣mels, like the
<HI>Neopolitan</HI> Shepherd, who going to his Confessor at
<HI>Easter,</HI> nothing so much troubled his Conscience, as that he had
tasted a little Cream the <HI>Lent</HI> before; but he had often robbed and
murdered Passengers in the Mountains, which troubled not his Conscience,
because his Father and Grandfather had fol∣lowed that Trade before.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Power of King <HI>Charles</HI> (after his
strange Condescension, to let the Par∣liament sit as long as they
pleased) was little more than imaginary. The Crown of <HI>England</HI> gives
no proper Strength to them that wear it, if personal Force be not
proportioned to their Station; which, if it reached as far as Prero∣gative, it
would be a mighty Advantage, for then a Monarch might be sure; but as this
unhappy King's Case stood, his Empire consi∣sted chiefly in his
Submission to other Mens Wills, which was, in a Manner, but reigning by
Courtesy: And therefore the Affections of <PB N="60" REF="81"/> the People is
generally the strongest, but not the best Title, as we have often seen
and felt in <HI>England,</HI> in the last and this Age. Where∣fore, all
Degrees of Inferiority should be ten∣derly used; for, if they be trampled
upon, they will certainly grow sowre and stubborn, believing they have a
Right to be always well used: And the least Grievances suggest
muti∣nous Thoughts in them, and they presently run up their Pedigree to
<HI>Adam,</HI> saying, <HI>In the Beginning it was not so.</HI> And thus
the House of Commons served King <HI>Charles,</HI> being full of dutiful
Affections and Expressions, and abounded with large Promises of what
Demon∣strations of Duty they would shortly make him, in acknowledging his
Royal Favour and Prote∣ction to be a great Blessing to them, and
Pre∣servation of their Liberties and Privileges; when any of which were
infringed, they were found humbly to appeal to his Justice for Redress, the
Rights and Privileges of Parliament not be∣ing only their Birth-right and
Inheritance, but of the whole Kingdom; one of which Privileges undoubtedly was,
that the whole Right of the Revenue, upon the Book of Rates, was the People's,
and proceeded only from his Subjects Gifts; and then they inflicted severe
Penalties upon those that should presume, for the future, to collect
them, or to raise any Money, but as the Parliament should grant and
appoint: By which Means the King was exposed to all the Dangers that might
happen, either at Home or Abroad, and also deprived of the Possibility of
<PB N="61" REF="82"/> supporting the Government it self, and was thereby
reduced to a more helpless Condition, than the meanest of his Subjects, by
their un∣worthy Votes, and unwarrantable Proceedings. Thus the House of
Commons served the King, and did then farther declare, that tho' the Power of
the Militia was wholly in the King, yet the Power of the Money was solely in
them; and that without the Power of the Mo∣ney, to pay the Soldiers, the Power
of the Militia could be of little Force: So that unless the King and the
House of Commons agreed, the Sword must be left in the Scabbard. They then
also declared, That the King's Coming to the House, and the Speech he made
there, was a great Breach; and therefore desired he would name the Persons
that advised and induced him to that Action, that they might be punished,
this being the only Way to procure a firm Con∣fidence and Amity betwixt the
King and his People.</P>
<P>In Answer to this, the King conjured them by all the Obligations
of Love, Duty, and Obedience, to remove all their Doubts and Fears, and that
doing so, he did not doubt but God would render him a Great and Glorious
Prince, and them a free and happy People. But to all these Offers he had
most unsuitable Returns; so that then the King perceived plain∣ly, that
the House of Commons were by De∣grees stealing so much Power into their
own Hands, that they did not care what remained in his: For they had got the
Art of imposing <PB N="62" REF="83"/> upon the People's Understandings,
against their own Reason, and perswaded them they were in Danger of
Invasion, when the King was not only in Peace with all Christendom, but
even those Princes that were in War desired his Assi∣stance: And his
Majesty was so moved with those odious Imputations (which had most
per∣nicious Effects upon the Minds of his People) that he was forced to comply
with many things contrary to his Judgment, to obviate greater Inconveniencies,
which were likely to rise against him, by those false and scandalous
Sug∣gestions: And therefore he often answered their seditious and
undutiful Expressions, with too much Gentleness and Condescension,
thinking that Way to undeceive them, and thereby to restore them to their
Understandings, before they could be awakened to their Duty due to their
Sovereign, the King believing he was to stoop to all Arts and Means for that
Purpose. But herein he was ill advised, and took false Measures; for
tho' the Proceedings of the House of Commons, and the Tumults raised by
them, were the highest Affront to his Majesty, yet the House of Peers was
then in a tractable Temper, and with a little Patience might have been brought
to blast all the Extravagancies of the House of Commons. But other
Resoluti∣ons were then taken, which proved fatal to the King and Kingdom. It
is true, the Votes, and Affronts of the House of Commons were great, and the
Tumults also, but the House of Lords was then well disposed, and if
managed by the <PB N="63" REF="84"/> King with a little Patience, the Higher
House had blasted all the Extravagancies of the Low∣er House, which, at
that Time, were the At∣tempts of Persons in Despair, and the Strug∣lings of
Men at the last Gasp: And if the King would have been only a Spectator of
the Di∣vision between the two Houses, and so have encouraged the Lords,
who were firm to the King, the Commons would have been brought within their due
Limits; but the King thought, by his Gentleness and easy Carriage, to
recover his Subjects to their Sobriety, before they would be apprehensive of
their Duty, and by that Way undid all. The Truth is, the King's Passing the
Bill against the Bishops, was a great Weakening of his Party, not only by
losing so many Voices in the Lords House, but it much influenced those,
(whose Minds were then in Suspense) to see Foundations shaken.
Besides, they that knew well the King's Disposition, did believe nothing
could have prevailed with him to pass so Antimonarchical an Act, and
there∣fore could never after be sure the King would deny any thing that was
importunately asked: And so either some withdrew themselves from
those Consultations, that they might decline the Danger of Envy, by
contradicting them, or else suffered themselves patiently to be car∣ried
on by the Stream, and to agree to any thing that was lustily attempted. But
truly, I think nothing ought to discourage publick Spirits from contributing
all they can to the Firmness of such Counsels, as they esteem most
just and safe <PB N="64" REF="85"/> for the publick Good, and not to
withdraw themselves upon any Pretence. Certainly the King was here
overperswaded to agree with the Parliament in this Act against Bishops,
that so for the future he might be able to deny them nothing; and this
Condescension of his Maje∣sty was very surprizing to the whole Kingdom,
and much blamed by all, but only those who had a Hand in perswading the
King to it.</P>
<P>It was then indeed a sad Prospect, to see the melancholy
Condition the King was in, sunk, in a few Days, from the Heighth of all
Great∣ness, which made his Enemies before to fear him, to such a Degree of
Lowness, that his own Servants durst hardly come near him. He then
perceived (when it was too late) that his Granting more than ever Prince had
done, had encouraged the People to ask more than ever Subjects had demanded;
and yet the King de∣clared, if he knew the particular Grounds of his Subjects
Fears, he would most gladly apply suitable Remedies, and desired they
would not, out of Apprehension of possible Dangers, throw his Majesty
and themselves into real and present Inconveniencies; and that they would
pursue such Methods as might restore Felicity both to King and People.
The King farther assured the House of Commons, That he would satisfy
all their just Demands, by retracting any thing he had done, which seemed
but to intrench upon their Privileges, and hoped they would have the same
Regard to his Honour and Reputation, with that of his Subjects: But
whatsoever the <PB N="65" REF="86"/> King said or promised, signified
little with the Parliament: For then both Houses declared, they were the
supreme Judicature of the King∣dom; and when they had declared what the Law
of the Land was, to have it disputed or contradicted, (tho' by the King's
Command) was a Breach of Privilege, and not to be obey∣ed; which was to
declare, in plain Terms, that a Vote of the two Houses was obligatory to all
without; (tho' against his Majesty's Con∣sent) which Resolve did
absolutely annull the Laws of the Land, and Liberty of the Subject, and let
all sober Men see, that the fatal Period of both was near an End, and that
a Founda∣tion was then laid for Anarchy, which soon followed.</P>
<P>But I must not forget to say, that a little be∣fore the War
was declared, the Queen went with the Princess <HI>Mary</HI> her Daughter, to
the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> her Husband, and was ac∣companied by the King
to <HI>Dover,</HI> from whence the King returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and
sent for the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> to go
with him towards <HI>York,</HI> where he was well received. The Parliament
sent after him the nineteen Propositions, which were treated on, and
refused by the King. But I will not omit one Passage at
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> before the King left it, which was somewhat strange and
ominous; which was thus. The King commanded his Statue to be carried from
<HI>Greenwich</HI> Garden into the Magazine: In the Carriage of it, the Face
being upwards, a Swallow, or some other <PB N="66" REF="87"/> Bird, flying
over it, dunged in the Face of the King's Statue, which was wiped off
immediate∣ly by those that carried it; but notwithstanding all Endeavours,
it could not be gotten off, but turned into Blood. This Statue was made at
<HI>Rome,</HI> by the famous Statuary Signor <HI>Bernino</HI>; and when the
King's Picture was brought to him, by which he was to make the Statue, with
po∣sitive Directions to conceal whose Picture it was, Signor
<HI>Bernino,</HI> after having look'd some∣time very stedfastly upon it,
said, he had never seen any Picture, whose Face shewed so much
Greatness, and withal such Marks of Sadness and Misfortune, which proved
too true in all its Circumstances; for never any King kept greater State or
Order in his Court, and was more majestick in keeping up his Dignity, till at
last he was made a sad Spectacle both to Men and Angels, before his own
Palace.</P>
<P>But, leaving this Digression, it is Time to tell you, that
both Houses declared, the King∣ly Prerogative, which was before lodged in the
Crown, tho' with some Limitations, was now no more there, but in the two
Houses of Par∣liament: Whereas, by the Constitution of the
<HI>English</HI> Government, the King is singly Sove∣reign, and no Power on
Earth co-ordinate with him: And as Almighty God is the absolute So∣vereign of
all Princes, so imperial Princes (as the Kings of <HI>England</HI> are
esteemed) are abso∣lute, next, and immediately under God, to whom alone
they are accountable. And there∣fore those that set the Laws above the
Maker <PB N="67" REF="88"/> of them, or subordinate Magistrates above the
Fountain of the first Power, usurp upon the original Founder, and take upon
them to re∣move the unchangeable Foundations of Power it self: For there is
no longer any Govern∣ment, where the Inferior incroaches upon the Superior, and
confounds the Relations of Kings and Subjects, in that Anarchical Whimsey of
imagining that Kings are to govern by Contract, and Subjects to obey
accordingly: Whereas no Man can shew, that there ever was an Origi∣nal
Contract between former Kings and the People of <HI>England,</HI> besides
that which was implied in the Constitution; and the very Sup∣position of
one is repugnant to all our Laws, and expressly opposite to the Words and
Sense of many of our Statutes; there being nothing more irreconcileable and
contradictory, than a Contract by which our Kings are made judici∣ally
accountable to their People, or censurable for Miscarriages in their
Government, when several Acts of Parliament do not only declare our Kings to
be unaccountable, but make it High Treason to take up Arms against them,
upon any Pretence whatsoever. And, to ima∣gine it either lawful or
practicable, to question and depose Kings, without a Liberty of taking up
Arms against them, is a Contradiction that none will pretend to reconcile,
who are not Lunatick, or deeply Hypochondriacal: And as for that Contract in
our first Constitution, it only declares the Ends for which our Princes
were to Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> The Safety, Peace, and <PB N="68" REF="89"/>
Prosperity of their People, to teach and instruct them, that they were to
govern by Laws; but it no way promises, that they should be accoun∣table to
their People, or arraigned by their Subjects, leaving them for that only
responsible to God, and in no manner punishable, but by the Stings of
their own Consciences: <HI>For who can say to the King, what doest
thou?</HI></P>
<P>About this Time the War was openly decla∣red against the King,
after his being refused Entrance into <HI>Hull</HI>; whereupon he went to
<HI>York.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was named General for the
Parliament: the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> Ge∣neral of the Horse: The Lord
<HI>Kimbolton, Sta∣pleton, Balfour,</HI> and <HI>Ramsey,</HI> General
Officers for the Parliament. Whereupon the King na∣med the Earl of
<HI>Lindsey</HI> Lord Chamberlain of <HI>England,</HI> to be his Lieutenant
General, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Cousin to the King, General of the Horse,
Sir <HI>Jacob Astley</HI> Major General of the Foot, and Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>
Commissary General of the Horse.</P>
<P>Thus the War was began, and the King, by a very unhappy Accident,
was obliged to de∣clare before he was in any Condition for Action. The
Occasion, This: Collonel <HI>Goring,</HI> Gover∣nour of
<HI>Portsmouth,</HI> declared for the King, before the King was ready to
march to his Suc∣cour. Upon some private Suspicion the Par∣liament had of
<HI>Goring,</HI> he was sent for, and examined, and upon his Confession
of some things relating to the Army, the Lords <HI>Wilmot, Ashburnham</HI>
and <HI>Pollard,</HI> all three Members, <PB N="69" REF="90"/> were expelled the
House of Commons, and sent to several Prisons; but <HI>Peircy</HI> and
<HI>Jermyn,</HI> who were also Members accused, escaped. This
Confession of <HI>Goring</HI> gave him a great Reputa∣tion with the
Parliament, who sent him back to his Government with Money to pay the
Sol∣diers, and to take Care of his Government. By his great Dexterity, he
perswaded the King, that he was not only sorry for the Fault he had
com∣mitted, but that he would soon redeem it by some signal Service to
the King; and he managed him∣self with such Address, that he received
Three Thousand Pounds from the Queen, to fortify the Garrison, when it
should be necessary for him to declare for the King; and at the same
time he received a great Supply from the Parliament, for Payment of the
Garrison, that it might be kept for their Service. Some time after, upon
some new Information, he was sent for again, and appeared in the House,
and justified himself with so much Innocence and Unaffected∣ness, that
the House of Commons, after an Apology for the Trouble they had given him,
commanded him to return to his Government, and to take great Care for the
Safety of the Place, which was of much Importance to them, and consented to
all he proposed in behalf of the Garrison. In the mean time, he assured
his Majesty, (by those that were employed be∣tween them) that in a short
time he should be in a Condition to declare for the King, when the King
should require it; but by the Sequel, we shall find he was obliged to do
it, much <PB N="70" REF="91"/> sooner than he was prepared for it, tho' no
sooner than he had Reason to expect it. It seems, when the Lord
<HI>Kimbolton</HI> received his Commission to be Lieutenant General of the
Horse for the Parliament, <HI>Goring</HI> was appointed to be his
Major-General: But <HI>Goring</HI> wrote to his Lordship, desiring he might
be excused for his Attendance upon the Army, till it was rea∣dy to march,
that he might be present in his Garrison, till some Fortifications were
perfected, that were necessary for that important Place: Upon which the
Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> prevailed with the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> that
<HI>Goring</HI> should not be sent for, till they were ready to enter upon
Action; and, at last, upon several Instances from the Lord
<HI>Kimbolton</HI> to General <HI>Goring,</HI> to come away, after several
Excuses, he told him, he was advised by Counsel, that it was dange∣rous
to leave the Place without the King's Leave, having received the Command of
that Place from him. Hereby the King received a consi∣derable Reputation,
that so important a Place as <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> with so considerable
an Officer as Collonel <HI>Goring,</HI> had declared for him: But his
declaring, before the King was ready, or the Garrison in Condition to
sustain a Siege, was the Cause of the King's Resolution of setting up
his Standard; and the Loss of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> which soon happened,
gave a great Disorder to the King's Affairs: For the Parliament sent
forthwith to besiege it, and <HI>Goring</HI> was obliged to surrender it,
upon very good Articles for himself, going into <HI>France</HI> with the
Money he <PB N="71" REF="92"/> had received on both Sides, without making good
his Promise to either. But this his Car∣riage was much resented by all the
King's Friends, and more particularly by those who were expelled the House.
If his Conscience and Integrity had equalled his Wit and Courage, he had been
one of the most eminent Men of the Age he lived in: But he could not
resist Temptations, and was a Man without Scruple, and loved no Man so
well, but he would cozen him, and afterwards laugh at him, as he did at the
Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI>; and of all his Qualifica∣tions (which were many)
Dissimulation was his Master-piece, in which he so much excelled, with
his great Dexterity, seeming Modesty and Unaffectedness, that in this
Concern, of <HI>Ports∣mouth,</HI> he cozened the House of Commons twice,
where were many Persons not easily to be deceived; neither were they
ashamed to be cozened twice by him, who was so perfect a Master in that
Art of Deceiving.</P>
<P>Upon this Incident, the King published a Declaration, wherein
all the insolent and re∣bellious Actions of both Houses were recited,
forbidding all his Subjects from paying any Obedience to them, and requiring
all that could bear Arms, to be present to serve him at
<HI>Nottingham,</HI> the 24th of <HI>August</HI> following, on which Day he
intended to set up his Royal Stan∣dard, where all his good Subjects were
obliged to attend. Many thought his Majesty had better have set it up at
<HI>York:</HI> But the Inclina∣tion the King had to be near <HI>London,</HI>
and his <PB N="72" REF="93"/> Hopes of great Effects from <HI>Portsmouth,</HI>
(which proved vain) made him prefer <HI>Notingham</HI>; and the Earl of
<HI>Cumberland</HI> was left Commander in Chief of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI>
assisted with Sir <HI>Thomas Glemham.</HI> Most Persons in
<HI>Yorkshire</HI> were very faithful to the King, except the Lord
<HI>Fairfax</HI> and his Son, who were to be made Prisoners; the Seizing of
them had probably prevented the Mischief which soon after broke out in
those Parts; but the King (being always ill ill advised) could not admit
they should be made Prisoners. The King came to <HI>Nottingham</HI> some
Days before his Standard was set up, and hearing some Regiments, by Order
from the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> were marching to <HI>Coventry,</HI> the
King hastened thither with some Troops of Horse well armed, and got
thither the Day before the Parliament's Forces. However, the Gates were shut
against him, and some of his Servants kill'd from the Walls. The King had
no Remedy for this Affront, but lodged that Night at <HI>Stonely Abbey,</HI> at
Sir <HI>Thomas Lee</HI>'s. The next Day the King's Body of Horse, being near
the Enemy at <HI>Southam,</HI> who were not above Twelve Hundred Foot, with one
Troop of Horse, in a free Campagne, yet they retired without being charged.
Commissary <HI>Wilmot</HI> then commanded the King's Horse, and several
Reflections were made upon his not charging them. About this time I was with
the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> at <HI>Warwick,</HI> having left
<HI>Coventry</HI> some Months before, where I resided with my Father, being
then very young, and went with two Horses, <PB N="73" REF="94"/> and one of
his Men, to the Earl of <HI>Northam∣pton,</HI> who was Lord Lieutenant of
<HI>Warwick∣shire,</HI> with whom I was when he first put the
Commission of Array in Execution at <HI>Coleshill,</HI> eight Miles from
<HI>Coventry</HI> towards <HI>Bermingham.</HI> From thence we went to
<HI>Warwick,</HI> in Hopes to have surprized that Castle; but Sir
<HI>Edward Peito</HI> was gotten into it before, and had Orders to keep it for
the Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> whose Castle it was, and his Lordship was then
employed by the Par∣liament, to settle the Militia in
<HI>Warwickshire.</HI> The Castle was strong, and well scituated, the
River <HI>Avon</HI> running by it. Our Endeavours for taking it, were to little
Purpose, for we had only two small Pieces of Cannon, which were brought
from <HI>Compton House,</HI> belonging to the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI>
and those were drawn up to the Top of the Church Steeple, and were
discharged at the Castle, to which they could do no Hurt, but only frighted
them within the Castle, who shot into the Street, and killed several of
our Men. The King (as I said before) being repul∣sed from
<HI>Coventry,</HI> hastened back towards <HI>Not∣tingham,</HI> and the Earl
of <HI>Essex</HI> drawing near us with his Army, being then at
<HI>Southam,</HI> my Lord of <HI>Northampton,</HI> with his Troop of Gentlemen,
which were numerous, marched towards <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> where we met Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> with some Troops of Horse, with whom we joined, and drew up
in the Fields, not far from <HI>Powych</HI> Bridge, upon the <HI>Severn,</HI>
where we stood very quietly for some time, being informed that the Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> was marching after us. We had <PB N="74" REF="95"/> not been
long in this Posture, before some Troops of Horse, commanded by Collonel
<HI>Nathaniel Fiennes,</HI> who lay on the other Side <HI>Powych</HI> Bridge,
expecting to meet the Vanguard of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Army, passed the
Bridge, and having passed the Defiles, he drew up his Troops not far from
ours, which the Prince gave him Time to do; but then the Prince charged and
routed them, and sent them back over the Bridge, in great Confusion and
Disorder. In this Action we took several Prisoners, amongst whom was
one Collonel <HI>Sandys,</HI> who was mortally woun∣ded, and died some Hours
after. Major <HI>Dou∣glass,</HI> and several others, were killed upon the
Place. This was the first Action I was ever in, and being upon an unruly
Horse, he ran away with me amongst the Enemy, while we pursued them to
the Bridge, in which Hurly I lost my Hat; but my Horse's Courage being
somewhat abated, I stopp'd him before we came to the Bridge, and so
returned with our own Troops. We retired that Evening into the City of
<HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> where being refreshed, we marched that Night towards
<HI>Ludlow,</HI> where we stayed some time; and from thence we went to
<HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> where we stay'd till the King came thither with his
Army, which much increased in those Quarters, by several Regiments newly
raised in those Parts for the King. The next Day after our leaving
<HI>Worcester,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> came thither with his
Army, and made that City his Head Quarters for some time. The King stay'd
at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> till his Army was well recruited, <PB N="75" REF="96"/>
and then Resolutions were taken to march to∣wards <HI>London,</HI> in Hopes
to get thither before the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who was then, with the
Par∣liament Army, about <HI>Worcester</HI> and <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P>While the King stay'd about <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> his Army was
modelled into several Regiments of Horse, Foot, and Dragoons, which, in
all, made a considerable Body: The Horse were put into several Brigades,
the Foot into Tertia's (as they were then called) and we had Three or Four
Regiments of Dragoons: Our chief Want was Arms; for most of the Regiments,
which were raised in <HI>Wales,</HI> were very ill armed. However, they were
brave and resolute to serve their King, with such Arms as they had, or
could get in their March, and our Army increa∣sed daily, by many coming to us
from all Parts, as we marched. From <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> we marched thro' Part
of <HI>Staffordshire</HI> and <HI>Warwickshire:</HI> I was then with the
Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> in his own Troop, which consisted of One
Hun∣dred Gentlemen of Quality. The Lord <HI>Com∣pton,</HI> eldest Son to the
Earl, was the Right∣hand Man; Sir <HI>Charles Compton,</HI> his second Son,
was Cornet; and Mr. <HI>Arden,</HI> a Gentleman of one of the most ancient
Families in <HI>War∣wickshire,</HI> was Lieutenant to the Earl. We were then
put into the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Re∣giment of Horse, which
consisted of six gallant Troops, besides the Servants: The Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI>'s own Troop commanded by Sir <HI>Thomas Byron,</HI> who was
Collonel of the Regiment, with Sir <HI>Thomas Daniel</HI> Lieutenant, and Mr.
<HI>Mettham</HI> <PB N="76" REF="97"/> of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> Cornet: The Duke
of <HI>York</HI>'s Troop, commanded by the Lord <HI>Aubigny,</HI> Brother to
the Duke of <HI>Richmond:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s Troop,
commanded by his Bro∣ther Collonel <HI>Cavendish:</HI> The Earl of
<HI>Lindsey</HI>'s Troop, commanded by his Son the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
of <HI>Eresby:</HI> The Earls of <HI>Northam∣pton</HI> and
<HI>Westmoreland</HI> commanded each their own Troop; and all the Servants of
the whole Regiment were put into one Troop, comman∣ded by Captain
<HI>Davison,</HI> an old experienced Low-Country Soldier, who was recommended
for that Employ, by the old Earl of <HI>Nor∣thampton.</HI></P>
<P>We marched thro' a great Part of <HI>Warwick∣shire,</HI> and
came under <HI>Wormington</HI> Hills, on <HI>Saturday</HI> in the Evening, the
Twenty Second Day of <HI>October,</HI> 1642. The King lodged that Night, at Sir
<HI>William Chancie</HI>'s, at <HI>Ratott</HI> Bridge, and Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> at the Lord <HI>Spen∣cer</HI>'s, at <HI>Wormleighton.</HI> The
Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment, in which we were, was quartered in two or
three Villages under <HI>Wormington</HI> Hills, When it was dark, we saw
several Fires not far from us, and sending out a Party to see, we were
soon informed, that the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was there with his whole
Army, and quartered at <HI>Keinton,</HI> a Market-Town. Whereupon our whole
Regiment drew into the Fields, and had Provi∣sions brought us from the
Villages, and we forthwith gave Notice to the King and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
and soon after we received Orders to be upon our Guard all Night, and to be
the <PB N="77" REF="98"/> next Morning by Eight, at the Rendezvous upon
<HI>Wormington</HI> Hills. The King, with the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and
Duke of <HI>York,</HI> came soon after, and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who
called a general Council of War, where it was debated, whether to march towards
<HI>London,</HI> or to march back, and fight the Enemy, whom we saw from the
Hill, embattelling their Army in the Bottom near <HI>Keinton.</HI> To march
from them was thought dishonourable, as if we feared them, and they would be
sure to follow, and give us continual Trouble in our March, when we should
not, perhaps, find so good Occasion to fight them; and so it was
resolved, that we should go down the Hill and attack them. Whereupon great
Preparations were made, and Precautions taken, for descending the Hill, which
was very steep and long, and had been impracticable, if the Enemy had drawn
nearer to the Bottom of it; but we saw by the Ranging their Army, that they
intended to stay there for us, having a good Market Town by them, and not far
from <HI>Warwick.</HI> In the first Place, it was resolved, that Collonel
<HI>Washington,</HI> with his Regiment of Dragoons, should descend the
Hill, and possess some Inclosures and Briars on the right Hand of our
Army, and a forlorn Hope of Six Hun∣dred Horse were ordered likewise to
descend be∣fore the Army, and the Carriage Horses of the Cannon were put
behind the Carriages, excepting a Horse or two before, and the Foot were
orde∣red to descend as well as they could. The King was that Day in a black
Velvet Coat lin'd <PB N="78" REF="99"/> with Ermin, and a Steel Cap covered with
Vel∣vet. He rode to every Brigade of Horse, and to all the Tertia's of Foot,
to encourage them to their Duty, being accompanied by the great Officers of the
Army: His Majesty spoke to them with great Courage and Chearfulness,
which caused Huzza's thro' the whole Army. I take the Liberty here to
remember one Pas∣sage which was remarkable. It seems, that very Morning,
before the Army descended the Hill, the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> (being
returned from his Travels) waited then upon the King, by whom his Grace was
very well received and caressed. He brought with him one Mr.
<HI>Scroop,</HI> who had accompanied him. After this Gentle∣man had kissed
the King's Hand, as also that of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and Duke of
<HI>York,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> told the King, that the Gen∣tleman's
Father was Sir <HI>Gervase Scroop,</HI> who had a good Estate, had raised
a Foot Regiment in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> to serve his Majesty, and was
then in the Army, but very angry with his Son, and would not see him, or be
reconciled to him, because he went with the Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> without
his Father's Consent, and had spent much more Money than he allowed him.
The Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> therefore prayed the King to make them Friends.
Whereupon the King sent for the Father, and told him, it was his Plea∣sure
he should be reconciled to his Son, who being then present, demanded upon
his Knees his Father's Blessing; whereupon the Father gave it him, and
said thus to his Son: <HI>I am</HI> <PB N="79" REF="100"/> <HI>now going down
the Hill to serve the King, and if I be killed, I have left you, my Son,
enough to spend:</HI> And the Son presently answered; <HI>And if I be
killed, I shall leave you enough to pay for me.</HI> And so the Father and
Son went down the Hill together; and it so happened, that the Son saved his
Father's Life, who ha∣ving received many Wounds, was stript, and left for
dead, and was brought off the next Morning by his Son, in one of the King's
Coaches, who lived some Years after, always very kind to his Son, and left
him a very good Estate. I have presumed to add this Particular, because I
have had great Obligations to that Family; and upon King <HI>Charles</HI> II.'s
Restora∣tion, he was made Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> by the Name of Sir
<HI>Adrian Scroop:</HI> And I was then one of the Gentlemen that brought him to
the King, when his Majesty put the Red Ribband about him. But, leaving this
Digression, let us turn again to the King's Army, which, about Ten in the
Morning, began to descend the Hill, the Foot getting down several Ways
which the Horse could not do, by reason of the Hill's Steepness. When the
whole Army was down, and drawn into Order, the King desired the Earl of
<HI>Lindsey,</HI> who was his Lieutenant General, that he would permit
General <HI>Ruthen,</HI> an old <HI>Scotch</HI> Officer, and who had long
served under <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> the late King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and had been a Lieutenant General in his Ar∣my, to draw up his Majesty's Army
that Day, and to command it, being an old experienced <PB N="80" REF="101"/>
General; to which the Earl of <HI>Lindsey</HI> (being wholly made of
Obedience) willingly complied, and said he would serve the King that Day,
as Collonel of the King's Royal Regiment of Foot Guards, which he did,
accompanied by his Son, the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Eresby.</HI> The
Enemy had all the Morning to draw up their Army, in a great plain Field, which
they did to their best Advantage, by putting several Bodies of Foot with
Retrenchments and Can∣non before them, and all their Foot were lined with
Horse behind them, with Intervals betwixt each Body, for their Horse to
enter, if need required; and upon their right Wing were some Briars covered
with Dragoons, and a little be∣hind, on their left Wing, was the Town of
<HI>Keinton,</HI> which supplied them with Provisions, and where their
Baggage and Carriages were.</P>
<P>Our whole Army was drawn up in a Body, the Horse Three deep in
each Wing, and the Foot in the Center Six deep. The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s
Regiment was on the right Wing, which was commanded by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
and Collo∣nel <HI>Washington</HI> was with his Dragoons upon our Right. In
the Center was the Infantry, com∣manded in chief by General <HI>Ruthen,</HI>
and un∣der him, by Sir <HI>Jacob Astley.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Lindsey</HI>
marched on Foot, in the Head of the Regiment of the Royal Foot Guards, with his
Son, the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edmond Verney</HI> carried the
Royal Standard. The left Wing of our Horse was commanded by Com∣missary
General <HI>Wilmot,</HI> with Collonel <HI>Fielding</HI> <PB N="81" REF="102"/>
and some other principal Officers; and Collonel <HI>George Lisle,</HI> with
Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Ennis,</HI> were in the left Wing, with a Regiment of
Dra∣goons, to defend the Briars on that Side, and we had a Body of Reserve,
of Six Hundred Horse, commanded by the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon.</HI> When our
Army was drawn up at the Foot of the Hill, and ready to march, all the Generals
went to the King (who intended to march with the Army) and desi∣red he would
retire to a rising Ground, some Di∣stance from thence, on the Right, with
the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and Duke of <HI>York</HI> (having his Guard of
Pensioners on Horseback with him) from whence he might see the Issue
of the Battle, and be out of Danger; and that otherwise the Army would not
advance towards the Enemy: To which the King (very unwillingly) was at last
perswaded.</P>
<P>Just before we began our March, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>
passed from one Wing to the other, gi∣ving positive Orders to the
Horse, to march as close as was possible, keeping their Ranks with
Sword in Hand, to receive the Enemy's Shot, without firing either Carbin or
Pistol, till we broke in amongst the Enemy, and then to make use of our
Fire-Arms as need should require; which Order was punctually observed. The
Enemy stayed to receive us, in the same Po∣sture as was formerly
declared; and when we came within Cannon Shot of the Enemy, they discharged
at us three Pieces of Cannon from their left Wing, commanded by Sir <HI>James
Ram∣sey;</HI> which Cannon mounted over our Troops, without doing any Hurt,
except that their se∣cond <PB N="82" REF="103"/> Shot killed a
Quarter-Master in the Rear of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Troop. We soon
after engaged each other, and our Dragoons on our Right beat the Enemy from the
Briars, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> led on our right Wing so furi∣ously,
that, after a small Resistance, we forced their left Wing, and were
Masters of their Can∣non; and the Prince being extreamly eager of this
Advantage (which he better knew how to take, than to keep) was not content with
their Cannon, and keeping their Ground, but eager∣ly pursued the Enemy, who
fled on the other Side of <HI>Keinton</HI> towards <HI>Warwick:</HI> And we of
the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment, (who were all scattered) pursued
also, till we met with two Foot Regiments of <HI>Hambden</HI> and
<HI>Hollis,</HI> and with a Regiment of Horse coming from <HI>Warwick</HI> to
their Army, which made us hasten as fast back as we had pursued. In this
Pursuit I was wounded in the Head by a Person who turned upon me, and
struck me with his Pole-axe, and was seconding his Blow, when Sir
<HI>Thomas Byron</HI> being near, he shot him dead with his Pistol, by
which Means I came back. In fine, by meeting these three Regiments, we were
obli∣ged to return back to our Army, and then found our great Error, in leaving
our Foot naked, who were rudely handled by the Enemy's Horse and Foot
together, in our Absence, who fell principally upon the King's Royal Regiment
of Foot Guards, who lost Eleven of Thirteen Colours, the King's
Standard-Brearer, Sir <HI>Ed∣mond Verney,</HI> killed, and the Royal Standard 
<PB N="83" REF="104"/> taken, which was presently retaken by Cap∣tain <HI>John
Smith,</HI> who was Knighted for it that Night by the King, under the Standard
Royal, and made a Baronet with the usual Ceremonies; and had afterwards a
large Medal of Gold gi∣ven him, with the King's Picture on the one Side, and
the Banner on the other, which he always wore to his dying Day, in a large
green watered Ribband, cross his Shoul∣ders. He was afterwards killed at the
Battle of <HI>Alresford</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> in the Year 1644, which
was called <HI>Cheriton</HI> Fight, with the Lord <HI>Bernard Stewart,</HI>
Brother to the Duke of <HI>Rich∣mond,</HI> and several others. Sir <HI>Robert
Walsh,</HI> an <HI>Irishman,</HI> who also pretended that he was very
instrumental in regaining the Standard, did also in the same Manner wear
a green Rib∣band with a Medal; but whether it was given him by Order, or how he
came by it, I do not know, tho' I have often seen him wear it. In this Battle
of <HI>Edgehill</HI> (as it was always called) during our Pursuit of the
Enemy, the Earl of <HI>Lindsey</HI> was mortally wounded, and taken
Pri∣soner, with his Son the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> who killed the Man that
wounded his Father, who died in the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Coach, as he
was carrying to <HI>Warwick.</HI> Now, when we returned from following the
Enemy, the Night came soon upon us, whereas, in all Probability, we had
gained the Victory, and made an End of the War, if we had only kept our Ground,
after we had beaten the Enemy, and not left our Foot naked to their Horse and
Foot: And, <PB N="84" REF="105"/> to add to our Misfortune, a careless
Soldier, in fetching Powder (where a Magazin was) clapt his Hand carelessly
into a Barrel of Powder, with his Match lighted betwixt his Fingers, whereby
much Powder was blown up, and many kill'd. The Night then soon parted both
Armies, and both Sides pretended to the Victory; but since we retired up the
Hill, from whence we came down, and left the <HI>Champ de Battaile</HI> to the
Enemy, I think we had no great Reason to brag of a Victory: For, the King,
with a great Part of the Army, marched that Night up to <HI>Wormington</HI>
Hills, it being a hard Frost, and very cold. But that which made us think we
had the Victory, was, that whereas the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was commanded
to hinder our getting to <HI>London</HI> before him, by this Battle we were
nearest <HI>London,</HI> and might have been there much before the Earl of
<HI>Essex,</HI> if we had taken right Measures: So that it may be said
of this Battle, <HI>Victus uterque fuit, Victor uterque fuit.</HI> There is
always great Difference in Relation of Battles, which is usually according to
the Interest of the Rela∣tors; when it is certain, that, in a Battle, the
next Man can hardly make a true Relation of the Actions of him that is next
him; for, in such a Hurry and Smoke as in a set Field, a Man takes Notice
of nothing but what relates to his own Safety: So that no Man give a clear
Account of particular Passages.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, being next after the Battle, several
Parties were sent down to view <PB N="85" REF="106"/> the Dead, the greatest
Part of the Enemy having retired in the Night to the Town of <HI>Keinton,</HI>
which was near them; and Mr. <HI>Adrian Scroop</HI> having seen his Father
fall (being much woun∣ded) desired the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> to speak to
the King, that one of his Coaches might go with him, to bring up his Father's
Body; which being granted, he found his Father stript, with several very
dangerous Wounds, and that he was alive: Whereupon he lapt him up in his Cloak,
and brought him in the Coach, where he was presently dressed by the
King's Chirur∣geons, and by their Care and Skill was cured, and lived many
Years after, tho' he had seven∣teen Wounds, and had died upon the Place, but
that the Coldness of the Weather stopp'd the Bleeding of his Wounds, which
saved also se∣veral other Mens Lives that were wounded. We rested all
<HI>Monday</HI> upon the Hill, to put our Army in Order; and seeing the Enemy
(as we thought) were preparing to retire, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was
resolved, that <HI>Monday</HI> Night, to go down the Hill, at a Place called
<HI>Sun-Rising,</HI> a Mile on our left Hand, and to fall upon the Enemy in
their Retreat; and on <HI>Tuesday</HI> Morning ve∣ry early, the Prince, with
a strong Detatch∣ment of Horse and Dragoons, fell into <HI>Keinton,</HI>
where he found all Houses full of wounded and sick Men, with divers
Officers, and several Waggons loaded with Muskets and Pikes, and all Sorts
of Ammunition, preparing to follow the Army, which was marched towards
<HI>War∣wick.</HI> These Arms were extreamly wanting in <PB N="86" REF="107"/>
our Army, and were a very good Supply for some Hundreds of <HI>Welchmen</HI>
were so brave, that they had no Arms but Pitchforks, and such like Tools,
and many only with good Cudgels; yet they went down the Hill as eagerly to
fight, as the best armed Men among them. And in∣deed most of the Gentry in
North <HI>Wales</HI> most willingly ingaged for the King, and raised what
Men they possibly could for his Service, while the King stayed in
<HI>Shropshire</HI>; and the Gentry of that Country did in a most
particular Man∣ner shew their Zeal for his Majesty's Service, there being
scarce a Family of any Consideration, in any of those Counties, that was
not ingaged for the King; as the <HI>Salisburies,</HI> the <HI>Mostyns,</HI>
the <HI>Trevors,</HI> the <HI>Thelwells,</HI> and several others whose
Families I have forgotten: But this I certainly knew, that none served the
King with greater Loyalty and Affection, than all the Gentry of North
<HI>Wales,</HI> wherein the Family of <HI>Bulkeley</HI> must not be
forgotten, who were always very eminent for the King's Service.</P>
<P>After this Battle of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> it was resolved the King
should hasten to <HI>London,</HI> and that if he could get thither before
the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> with his Army, the King would be certainly well
received, and, in all Probability, make an End of the War, of which the
Parliament was in such Fear, that several Expresses were sent to the
Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> to make all possible Haste with his Army to
<HI>London,</HI> and prevent the King's Coming before him: But our King trifled
away his Time in taking <HI>Banbury</HI> and <PB N="87" REF="108"/>
<HI>Broughton House,</HI> which belonged to the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> Places of
very little Consideration! and so marched very slowly towards
<HI>London,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> with his Army arrived
before him, tho' the King's Army was much nearer <HI>London,</HI> after the
Battle of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> if right Use had been made of it. By Judgment of
most, the Victory in this Battle was the King's, because he gain'd his
Point, a clear Passage for his Way to <HI>London</HI>; of which the
Parliament was so sensible, that not only reiterated Orders were sent
to hasten the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s March, but all the Shops, both in
<HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI> were shut up the next Day
after the Battle, that the People might be in a better Readiness to defend
themselves and the Parliament.</P>
<P>But alas! the King retarded his March, of which the Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> taking hold, got be∣tween the King and <HI>London</HI>; and
in this our March towards <HI>London,</HI> the Parliament sent a Petition to
the King, in a much humbler Strain than their former Messages to the King
used to be; which Petition the King liked well, and re∣solved to reside
at his Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> there to receive the Parliament's
Propositions: But News being then brought to the King, that
<HI>Essex</HI> was advanced towards him, and had possessed the
Passes of <HI>Windsor, Kingston,</HI> and <HI>Acton,</HI> and that if
<HI>Essex</HI> should also take <HI>Brentford,</HI> the King would be
wholly surrounded, and depri∣ved either of moving or subsisting:
Whereupon a Council of War was called, and Resolutions taken, that the King's
Army should advance to <PB N="88" REF="109"/> <HI>Brentford,</HI> where, at
the first, we found con∣siderable Opposition. The Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment of Horse, where I was, being drawn up behind a
great Hedge, where the Enemy had planted some Cannon, which we saw not,
till they played so fast upon us, that we lost some Men, and were
obliged to draw off and retire for our better Security; and upon our Foot's
coming up, we beat the Regiments of <HI>Hambden</HI> and <HI>Hollis</HI> out of
the Town, took several Prisoners and Arms, and sunk two great Barks in
the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> with many Sol∣diers: And as two other Regiments
came up to their Succour, they were also beaten, and we took some Colours
and Cannon, and were in∣tire Masters of <HI>Brentford,</HI> until the Night;
but then finding the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> with his Army, was drawn out
upon <HI>Turnham Green,</HI> with the Trained Bands of the City, and that the
Ene∣my's Army was double to the King's, and that most of our Ammunition was
spent; it was therefore thought fit by the Council, that the King should
retreat. Whereupon the King re∣tired that Night to the Lord
<HI>Cottington</HI>'s House, near <HI>Hounslow,</HI> and we marched the
next Day by <HI>Colebrook,</HI> towards <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI>
the first of which Places was garrisoned, and <HI>Oxford</HI> was the
King's Head Quarters, where he made his Residence. I can give this Relation
with Certainty, being present in all that March, and in the Actions at
<HI>Brentford,</HI> till the King's Return to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and then the
Earl of <HI>Nor∣thampton</HI> was commanded to <HI>Banbury,</HI> which 
<PB N="89" REF="110"/> was given him for Winter Quarters, with Or∣ders to
raise a Regiment of Horse.</P>
<P>This Advance of the King's Army towards <HI>London,</HI> when a
Treaty of Peace was proposed both by the Parliament and the City of
<HI>London,</HI> in a milder Strain than they had ever done be∣fore, was by
many thought imprudent to make the Breach wider, and divers Reflections were
made upon it: However, the King sent Word to the Houses, that he intended
to settle his Court at such a Distance from them, as might take away all
Misapprehensions. Hereupon the City petition the King, professing their
Grief for his Distrust of them, and declare their Loy∣alty to him. And the
Parliament finding the general Inclinations of the People for Peace, resolved
to send some Propositions to the King, which not being accepted, the
Treaty was soon broken off. But then another Treaty was pro∣posed in
<HI>March</HI> following, and new Commissi∣oners named, which were only the
Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> with four of the House of Commons, who had
free Access to the King, who used them with great Civility and Favour, and
treated personally with them, because their Instructions were very
strict, and tied them up to treat with none but the King himself, where
they often attended, and had Access at all Times when they desired it, and
were allowed a very free Debate with his Majesty. In this Trea∣ty the King
shewed his great Parts and Abilities, Strength of Reason, and Quickness
of Appre∣hension, with much Patience hearing what was <PB N="90" REF="111"/>
objected against him, wherein he allowed the Commissioners all Freedom,
and when he dif∣fered from them in Opinion, he would tell them, by your Favour,
my Lord <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> (who was the chief of the Commissioners) I
am not of your Opinion, or, I think other∣wise, and would himself sum up
their Argu∣ments, and give a clear Judgment upon them. The King's great
Unhappiness was, that he had a better Opinion of others Judgment, than of his
own (tho' weaker than his own) and of this these Commissioners at that
time had a sad Experience, to their great Trouble.</P>
<P>It seems, in this Treaty, they so pressed his Majesty
with their best Reasons and Arguments, to grant what they desired, that
the King was so fully satisfied with their Reasons, that he abso∣lutely
agreed to what they proposed, and promi∣sed to give them their Answer the
next Morning, according to their Desires; but because it was then late, and
past Midnight, he deferred to give his Answer in Writing till the next
Morning, and commanded them to wait upon him accor∣dingly. The
Commissioners hereupon went to their Lodging full of Joy, in Hopes to
receive the Answer agreed upon; but, instead of what they expected, and was
promised by the King, he gave them a Paper quite contrary to what was
concluded between them the Night before. The Commissioners did most
humbly expostu∣late with his Majesty, and pressed him upon his Royal
Word, and the ill Consequences they feared would follow upon this new Paper:
To <PB N="91" REF="112"/> which the King told them, he had altered his Mind, and
that the Paper he gave them was his Answer which he was resolved to make
upon their last Debate, and they could obtain no other Answer from him,
which gave them much Sadness and Trouble. After this sad Rencoun∣ter,
(which the Commissioners did not expect) they enquired of some of the
King's particular Counsellours, how the King came to change his Mind, who
said, that after the King had left his Council, and was undressing,
some of those Gentlemen about him, whose Interest was for Continuance
of the War, and hearing what Answer the King had promised, never left
pressing the King, till they had perswaded and prevailed with him, to
change his former Reso∣lution, and to order his Answer to be drawn as then
delivered; which being intimated to the Commissioners, they used their
utmost En∣deavours to disswade the King from sending this Answer,
fearing it would break the Treaty; but they could not prevail, the Answer was
sent, and upon the Parliament's receiving it, they fortwith recalled their
Commissioners, and the Treaty ended unsuccessfully, having lasted
from the Beginning of <HI>March</HI> till the Middle of <HI>April.</HI> This
Relation I had from one of the Commissioners, my Cousin German, who, I am
sure, wished well to the King, and desired no∣thing more than a good
Peace between the King and his People: And this Gentleman was after accused
in the House of Commons, by a Lord who was at the Time of the Treaty with the
<PB N="92" REF="113"/> King in <HI>Oxford,</HI> but soon after deserted the
King, and went to the Parliament, and accused that Commissioner to have
had several private Conferences with the King, unknown to the rest of the
Commissioners; and if that Person had not been powerfully supported,
and high∣ly defended by Mr. <HI>Denzell Hollis,</HI> who was also a
Commissioner, that other Person had been ruined by that Lord's false
Accusation, who quite lost his Reputation by it. Thus we see a good King
was unhappily misled by those about him, which caused him often to
refuse those things to which he should chearfully have consented, and
freely have condescended to many things which he should have denied to the
last. It is certain, a Prince should esteem nothing more precious than
his Word, nothing more sacred than his Promise; which made <HI>Francis</HI>
I. of <HI>France</HI> say, That if Faith was to∣tally banished out of the
World, it should be found in his Word. Indeed a Prince should be careful of
promising any thing that may be of Damage to him, and where the Thing
pro∣mised cannot without good Reason bind to the Performance; and whether
what the King pro∣mised to those Commissioners were of that sort, I
will not undertake to determine.</P>
<P>When the King had settled his Court at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
recruited his Army, and fortified his Garrisons in all Parts, he gave
<HI>Banbury,</HI> and that Part of the Country, to the Earl of
<HI>Nor∣thampton,</HI> who was commanded to raise a Re∣giment of Horse,
which was given to the Lord <PB N="93" REF="114"/> <HI>Compton,</HI> his
eldest Son, and Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> his second Son, was made Lieutenant
Collonel of it: To Sir <HI>William Compton,</HI> his third Son, was given the
Castle of <HI>Banbury:</HI> One Troop in his Regiment of Horse was given to
Captain <HI>James Chamberlain,</HI> Brother to Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> who was
then High Sheriff of <HI>Oxfordshire:</HI> To Captain <HI>James
Chamberlain</HI> were given the two Villages of Upper and Lower
<HI>Heigford,</HI> opposite to <HI>North</HI> and <HI>Steeple Aston,</HI>
in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> for his Quarters, while he raised the said
Company. Mr. <HI>Herbert Jeffries,</HI> of <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> was his
Lieutenant, and I was his Cornet. This Com∣pany was soon raised, and the
first Time the Captain went out with it, he was killed near
<HI>Northampton,</HI> by one Captain <HI>Lawson.</HI> About the same time
Mr. <HI>Herbert Jeffries</HI> was sent for by his Uncle Sir <HI>Herbert
Price,</HI> upon Mr. <HI>Jef∣fries</HI>'s Father being drowned in passing
the Ri∣ver <HI>Wye:</HI> Whereupon Mr. <HI>Jeffries</HI> came no more back, and
the Troop of Horse fell to my Lot, where I continued not long; for the Lord
<HI>Wentworth,</HI> who was Major-General of the Horse by the Death of Sir
<HI>Thomas Byron,</HI> was also made Collonel of the Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment; and being very inquisitive to find out a young
active Man to be his Adjutant, I was recommended to his Lordship, by Mr.
<HI>Hat∣ton Farmer</HI> (Son to Sir <HI>William Farmer</HI> of
<HI>Eu∣ston</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire</HI>) who was at that time Cornet
to the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> The great Dif∣ficulty was, whether I should
quit my Troop, to be his Lordship's Adjutant? To which I was 
<PB N="94" REF="115"/> advised by many, assuring me by that Employ∣ment I
should know more of the War in one Year, than being a Captain all my
Lifetime; and so I quitted my Company, with the good Will of the Earl of
<HI>Northampton,</HI> after I had been at the Battle of <HI>Middleton
Cheney,</HI> near <HI>Banbury,</HI> where we beat the Parliament Troops. Upon
the quitting my Troop, Mr. <HI>George Chamberlain,</HI> another Brother of Sir
<HI>Thomas,</HI> was made Captain of it; and I had not been long with my Lord
<HI>Wentworth,</HI> before my Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> being Lieutenant General of
the Horse, desired me to be his Adjutant, which his Lord∣ship could not
refuse, the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> being his superior General Officer; and in
that Sta∣tion I remained with my Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> to his great
Satisfaction, till his Disgrace in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> as shall be said
hereafter.</P>
<P>During this Year 1643, I was Adjutant to my Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI>
when he defeated <HI>Waller</HI> at <HI>Roundway-Down,</HI> near the
<HI>Devizes,</HI> took his Cannon, Ammunition, and Baggage, with some Foot
Colours and Standards, and <HI>Wallet</HI> himself escaped to
<HI>Bristol.</HI> By this Loss of <HI>Waller</HI>'s, the King was Master
of all the West, <HI>Bristol</HI> and <HI>Exeter</HI> being soon after
delivered; and if the King had then marched to <HI>London,</HI> he had, in all
Probability, made an End of the War. But he was ill (if not maliciously)
perswaded, to besiege <HI>Gloucester,</HI> which was the only Place left
to the Parliament in these Parts. The King had Intentions of Storming it, but
fear∣ing to lose the best Part of his Infantry in that <PB N="95" REF="116"/> Action, and being assured it could not be re∣lieved, made the
King lose much Time, and the Opportunity of taking it: For the Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> soon raised an Army in <HI>London,</HI> for its Relief;
to prevent which, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> were
sent with all the Horse, to stop his Passage, or at least to retard
his March through <HI>Oxfordshire:</HI> And tho' the Prince had then a brave
Army, and was most commonly in a Race Campagne, and that we still marched
before <HI>Essex,</HI> to eat up the Provisions, and to attend his
Motions, yet we took no Advantage of him, nor was his Design of raising the
Siege of <HI>Gloucester</HI> prevented, tho' it was then in the last
Extremity. When <HI>Essex</HI> came upon the Brow of the Hills, not far
distant from <HI>Glou∣cester,</HI> he discharged some Cannon, to give
them Notice of his Coming, and the King hereupon raised the Siege, without
any Loss or Impeach∣ment from the Town. Thus, when the King's Affairs were in
a prosperous Condition, he trifled away Time to no Purpose in that
unfor∣tunate Siege. When <HI>Essex</HI> had put the City of
<HI>Gloucester</HI> in Order, and left them Cannon and Ammunition, he marched
unexpectedly to <HI>Tewksbury,</HI> which he surprized, and sent from
thence great Stores of all Sorts of Provision, which the King sent thither
from his Camp; and <HI>Essex</HI> likewise took in <HI>Tewksbury</HI> two
Re∣giments of Horse, with divers Officers, com∣manded by Sir <HI>Nicholas
Crisp;</HI> from whence he marched towards <HI>London,</HI> by the way of
<HI>Hun∣gerford</HI> and <HI>Newbury,</HI> where was the first
<HI>New∣bury</HI> <PB N="96" REF="117"/> Fight; but since I was not present
in that Battle, I will not pretend to give a Relation of it: Only this I may
say truly, that we staked there Pearls against Pebbles, and lost some
Men there of great Consideration, tho' the Enemy lost more Soldiers, and
were obliged to quit their Station; and in this Year 43, the King was so
successful, that the Parliament began to despair, and the prevailing
Party in the House of Commons were ready to truss up Bag and Baggage: But
<HI>Essex</HI>'s Success at <HI>Gloucester</HI> chan∣ged the Scene of
publick Affairs, and the King returned to <HI>Oxford.</HI> It was about this
time that the Earls of <HI>Bedford</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> deserted the
Parliament, and came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to submit themselves to the King:
But they not being received nor countenanced as they expected, they both
returned again to the Parliament: When the King ought most certainly to have
received them well, and to have used them kindly, for Encouragement to
others. But our unfortunate Prince was still advised to take false
Measures, in Affairs that most nearly concer∣ned him. Upon their first
Coming, there was a Debate in Council, by the King's Order, how they should
be received? Some thought his Ma∣jesty should receive them very
graciously, and with kind Expressions of his Acceptance of their Return
to his Service, and that the Behaviour of all others towards them, should be
such as might make them think themselves very wel∣come, without taking
Notice of any thing for∣merly done amiss by them: But others, of a 
<PB N="97" REF="118"/> contrary Judgment, would not have them ad∣mitted into the
King's Presence. Betwixt these Extremes, others were of Opinion, they
should neither be neglected nor courted, but admitted to kiss the King and
Queen's Hands. But the Reason of old <HI>Fabius</HI> ought to have been
consi∣dered, which he gave in the Case of <HI>Cossius Altinius,</HI>
who, after the Battle of <HI>Cannae,</HI> de∣serted the <HI>Romans,</HI> and
fled to <HI>Hannibal</HI>; and when the Condition of the <HI>Romans</HI>
mended, he came again to them. Hereupon many thought he should be esteemed
as a common Enemy, and sent back to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> as a perfidious
Person; but <HI>Fabius</HI> reprehended their Severity as unrea∣sonable,
who judged in the Heat of War, as in the Time of Peace, and told them, their
chief Care ought to be, that none of their Friends should forsake them, and
next, that they who had forsaken them, might return to their Obedience and
Protection, and be well used: Which Method should have been taken with
these two Earls, which had prevented their Return, and encouraged others to
follow them.</P>
<P>But it was the unhappy Temper of those who were often called to
Council in this King's Time, that Resolutions taken upon full Debate, were
seldom prosecuted with equal Resolution, but often changed upon new and
short Debates; and many Counsellours were irresolute and un∣constant,
and full of Objections, which much hindred good Resolutions. And the great
Mis∣fortune was, that the King most commonly <PB N="98" REF="119"/>
considered more the Person that spoke, as he was in his Grace or
Prejudice, than the Coun∣sel it self; and always suspected, or at
least trusted less to his own Judgment than he ought to have done, which
rarely deceived him so much as that of other Men: And if in the Case
aforementioned, he had followed his own Judgment, he had received and used
those Lords very kindly. But at this time the King's Affairs were in a
flourishing Condition, and it was the unlucky Temper of the King's Party, to
be the most desperately cast down upon the least ill Success, and,
upon any good, to be the most elated; and therefore were of Opinion against
receiving those Lords with any Civility, believing they returned to the King,
because the Parliament's Affairs were at that time but in a tottering
Condition.</P>
<P>The King having successfully settled military Affairs the
last Year, and the Parliament fear∣ing a farther Encrease of them, called
to their Assistance their Brethren the <HI>Scots,</HI> in Pursu∣ance of
their wicked League and Covenant; which second Voyage of theirs into
<HI>England,</HI> brought that Deluge of Mischiefs which after∣wards
followed; for, in the Beginning of the Year 44, the King's Affairs begun to
change Face, for <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Waller</HI> were soon recruited
at <HI>London,</HI> and by the Help of other associa∣ted Counties, they
raised two powerful Armies, marched into <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> hovering
about the King's Head Quarters, who not liking such Neighbours, had a Mind to
draw them from <PB N="99" REF="120"/> thence, and therefore left
<HI>Oxford.</HI> Upon this the Enemy was ordered to follow the King, leaving
his evil Counsellours unmolested in <HI>Oxford,</HI> contrary to what they
had always till then pretended, that their Design was only to remove the evil
Counsellours; but now it plainly appeared, that their Design was against
the King's sacred Person, since both Armies followed him, which being too
great to conti∣nue long together, they separated, and <HI>Essex</HI> was
perswaded by the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> and others, to reduce the Western
Counties to the Obedi∣ence of the Parliament, and that <HI>Waller,</HI> with
his Army, should attend the King's Motions, who was marching, as the Enemy
thought, to∣wards <HI>Wales:</HI> But the King gave <HI>Waller</HI> the Go-by,
and having gotten before him, was marching to <HI>Daventry</HI> in great
Diligence, ha∣ving left a strong Guard of Dragoons at <HI>Cro∣predy</HI>
Bridge (a Pass over the <HI>Charwell</HI> between both Armies)
<HI>Waller</HI> being on the other Side the River, waiting the King; and
perceiving the Guard was drawn off from <HI>Cropredy</HI> Bridge, and that the
Van of the King's Army was much before their Rear, the Van having marched
faster than was necessary; so that the Rear of the King's were but then
come to their Ren∣dezvous, and were not advanced so far as the Bridge, which
the King's Guard had quitted. <HI>Waller</HI> taking this Advantage, passed
over a great Part of his Army at this Bridge, under the Command of Collonel
<HI>Weems,</HI> who was General of the Artillery, with several Cannon 
<PB N="100" REF="121"/> of <HI>Weems</HI>'s Invention, being more easy of
Car∣riage; and this great Detachment of <HI>Waller</HI>'s Army was drawn up
just in the Way where the Rear of the King's Army was to pass, which was
commanded by the old Earl of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> who was of Necessity
obliged to fight the Ene∣my,. before he could get to the Van of the King's
Army; the whole Army of <HI>Waller</HI> being drawn up on the other Side the
River, to pass the Bridge, in Case <HI>Weems</HI> succeeded, of which
<HI>Waller</HI> doubted not, having passed over many more Troops than the
Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI> had in the Rear. However, the Earl behaved
him∣self so well in that Engagement, that, after a very sharp Dispute,
the Enemy was beaten, and forced over <HI>Cropredy</HI> Bridge, to join their
Army. Many were killed upon the Place, and many Prisoners taken, with all
their Cannon and Ammunition, and, amongst the Prisoners, <HI>Weems,</HI> a
<HI>Scot,</HI> and the King's sworn Servant, being made Master-Gunner of
<HI>England,</HI> a con∣siderable Employment; and besides, he had a good
Sum of Money given him, for the Inven∣tion of making those Leather Cannon.
After the Battle, he was was brought before the King, and had the Impudence to
tell his Majesty, in his <HI>Scotch</HI> Tone, That, in good Faith, his Heart
was always towards his Majesty. This Victory was not obtained without some
Loss on our Side, for Sir <HI>William Boteler,</HI> and Sir <HI>Wil-William
Clark,</HI> both Collonels of Horse, were killed, and much regretted, being
brave Men. We had there a Regiment of Dragoons com∣manded <PB N="101" REF="122"/> by Collonel <HI>Hooper,</HI> who signalized himself upon this
Occasion so well, that tho' he was of a mean Education, and small
Extra∣ction, yet such particular Notice was taken of him by the Earl of
<HI>Cleveland,</HI> who gave so good an Account of his Service that Day, that
the King gave him the Honour of Knighthood, by the Name of Sir <HI>Thomas
Hooper,</HI> to encou∣rage others to follow his Example. This De∣feat made
<HI>Waller</HI> hasten to <HI>London</HI> for Recruits, and the King taking
Advantage of his Retreat, turned again with his Army, and marched with great
Diligence after the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who was gone into the
West.</P>
<P>While the King was upon his March, he had an Account, that
<HI>York</HI> was besieged by the <HI>Scots,</HI> who were joined with
<HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Man∣chester</HI>; upon which Information, the King
sent Orders to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> to join with the Mar∣quess of
<HI>Newcastle</HI>'s Army, to raise that Siege, which the Prince did; but
not content with that, he would needs follow the Enemy, with whom he fought
upon <HI>Marston-Moor,</HI> four Miles from <HI>York,</HI> and had defeated
the Enemy, disordered their main Battle, possess'd their Cannon, and
forced their three Generals out of the Field; but being too furious in
pursuing his Advantage, and his Soldiers too busy in Pillaging,
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> who then commanded the Horse under <HI>Manchester,</HI>
having rallied toge∣ther some Troops, charged the Prince, and pressed him
so hard, that he changed the whole Fortune of the Day, and forced the Prince
to a <PB N="102" REF="123"/> disorderly Flight, and gained an entire Victory,
and took Prisoners Major General <HI>George Porter,</HI> Sir <HI>Charles
Lucas,</HI> Collonel <HI>Tybiard,</HI> and seve∣ral others. This Defeat was
infinitely preju∣dicial to the King's Affairs in the North, the Loss of
<HI>York</HI> soon following it, and many Re∣flections were made upon the
Prince's Fighting, which he should not have done, his Business only
having been to raise the Siege of <HI>York.</HI> Hereupon the Marquess of
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> with several other eminent Officers in the North, being
highly dissatisfied with the Prince, quit∣ted <HI>England,</HI> and went to
<HI>Hamburgh,</HI> whereby the whole North was soon after lost. The King
having received an Account of this De∣feat in his March, hastened the more
after <HI>Essex,</HI> and being come into a Race Campagne in
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> three or four Miles only from the Ene∣my, and General
<HI>Goring</HI> being newly come from the North, after the Defeat of
<HI>Marston-Moor,</HI> and was then with the King in the Head of his Army,
the Van of which was that Day commanded by the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> Major
General, and the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> Lieutenant General, brought up the Rear
of the Army with his own Brigade; and being ready to go to Prayers, Mr.
<HI>Elliot,</HI> of the King's Bed-cham∣ber, came to his Lordship, and told
him, the King would speak with him: To which the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>
replied, <HI>You see I am just going to Prayers, I will serve God
first, and then I shall serve the King the better after, and will
presently wait upon the King after Prayers:</HI> <PB N="103" REF="124"/> Which
being ended, as his Lordship was mar∣ching up to the King, Sir <HI>Edward
Sydenham,</HI> Knight-Marshal, came riding down the Hill, with several
Gentlemen, and told the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> that the King commanded him to be
his Prisoner. His Lordship being somewhat surprized with this
Message, turned his Horse, and I asked him, what Service he would
com∣mand me? To which his Lordship presently replied, <HI>I can command you
nothing, being a Prisoner; but I pray you acquaint the Lord</HI> Wentworth
<HI>with my present Condition</HI>; which I did, who was much surprized
with it, and so were all the other General Officers to whom I told it; and
they all concluded it was the Ef∣fect of General <HI>Goring</HI>'s coming to
the King. The Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> forthwith alighted, with several other
principal Officers, to consider what Measures to take, in so sudden and
unex∣pected a Change, and were all much unsatisfied, believing General
<HI>Goring</HI> to be the Cause, of whom they had no good Opinion, since
his Examination in Parliament, at the Beginning of the War, when he was
Governour of <HI>Ports∣mouth,</HI> which he soon delivered, and made good
Conditions for his going into <HI>France,</HI> after he had received Money on
both Sides, and resto∣red to neither. Upon this Consideration, the General
Officers of Horse were so far from be∣ing satisfied with the Change, that
they pre∣sently drew up an Address to the King, which was penned by Mr.
<HI>Adrian Scroop,</HI> the Substance of which was, as I well remember, as
followeth. <PB N="104" REF="125"/> <HI>That they, the Lord</HI> Wentworth,
<HI>and other Ge∣neral Officers of the Army, having had the Honourlong to
serve his Majesty under the Command of the Lord</HI> Wilmot, <HI>were so
well and intimately acquainted with all his Concerns relating to the Army, that
they were confident he could be guilty of no Crime but what they must know;
and that finding his Lordship suddenly disgraced, and fallen into his
Majesty's Displeasure, they there∣fore most humbly begged his Majesty
would gra∣ciously please to let them know what Fault the Lord</HI> Wilmot
<HI>had committed, that they might free themselves from it, or most humbly
implore the King's Pardon for it.</HI> This Address was presented to the
King by the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> accompanied with several General
Officers, and others of the Army. I was then present, when the King, having
first read the Address to him∣self, gave this verbal Answer, which I
heard the King say. <HI>That if the Lord</HI> Wilmot <HI>had continued to
command his Army of Horse, his Crown could not have long stood upon his
Head;</HI> and he assured the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> and those Officers
with him, that when the Business was over with the Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> (with whom he was now engaged) we should all know what
Fault the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> had committed: That, in the <HI>Interim</HI> his
Majesty was well satisfied of their Loyalty, who had presented that
Address, and commanded them to go to their several Brigades and Regiments,
and to obey General <HI>Goring,</HI> whom he had made General of all his
Cavalry.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="126"/>Hereupon General <HI>Goring</HI> went to the
Head of the Horse, to command a Thousand to be drawn out; but not finding
the Lord <HI>Went∣worth,</HI> nor the Adjutant General, he returned to the
King, and complained, he could find no General Officer, or Adjutant, to draw
out a Party: Whereupon the King asked for me (who every Night brought his
Majesty the List of the Quarters) and sent <HI>Tomkins,</HI> an Equerry,
to find me, and bring me to his Majesty, which he soon did; and the King
commanded me to go with General <HI>Goring,</HI> and obey his Orders: And
accordingly I forthwith drew out a De∣tachment of One Thousand Horse, under
the Conduct of Collonel <HI>Richard Nevil,</HI> of <HI>Billing∣beer</HI> in
<HI>Berkshire.</HI> The General was pleased with my Diligence, in so
soon drawing out the Detachment, and commanded me to come with him, and told
me, he made me that Day his Adjutant; and that I being the first Man that the
King had recommended to him, he would take particular Care of me, and
assured me, that whenever Collonel <HI>Scrimsour,</HI> an old
<HI>Scotch∣man,</HI> that was Adjutant-General, died, he would make me
Adjutant-General; which hap∣pened soon after, and then I was made
Adju∣tant-General of all the Horse that were, or should be raised in the
Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Town of
<HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> for so my Commission ran. But,
leaving this Digression, I must not omit to tell, that General
<HI>Goring</HI> being advanced to the Top of the Hill, about two Miles before
our Army, <PB N="106" REF="127"/> had there a perfect View of the Enemy, who
were then about <HI>Lestwythiel.</HI> He stopp'd then, and sent me back
in great Haste to the King, to tell him in what Posture the Enemy was,
desiring the King to advance with his Army without Delay, and that he would
make good the Post where he was, which would be very advantageous for his
Majesty's Army. In the mean time that I went from General <HI>Goring</HI> to
the King, he commanded Collonel <HI>Nevil</HI> to send a Party towards
<HI>Buconnock,</HI> the Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s House, where perhaps a further
Dis∣covery might be made of the Enemy. Where∣upon Collonel <HI>Nevil</HI>
sent out a Party under the Command of Monsieur <HI>Gascoigne,</HI> a
<HI>Florentine,</HI> who meeting some Country-Men, he asked them, if they
knew any thing of the Enemy? Who told him, if he made Haste to the Lord
<HI>Mohun</HI>'s House, he would find there some of the Parlia∣ment
Officers at Dinner, not believing the King's Army was so near them. Whereupon
the Party hastened thither, and surprized se∣veral Officers, whom they
brought Prisoners; for which Service, and some others after, he was
Knighted, and known by the Name of Sir <HI>Bernard Gascoigne,</HI> and was
made Major to General <HI>Goring</HI>'s Regiment of Horse, and served not
only to the End of the War in very good Esteem, but was also at the
Rising in <HI>Essex,</HI> and condemned to be shot to Death at
<HI>Colche∣ster,</HI> with Sir <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> and Sir <HI>George
Lisle;</HI> but being a Foreigner, he was reprieved, and saved. And now I
will tell the Reasons <PB N="107" REF="128"/> why I appointed Collonel
<HI>Nevil</HI> to command this Detachment of a Thousand Horse, tho' it was
not his Turn to go. Whilst the Address from the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> and
the General Officers was making to the King, his Lordship commanded me to go
to such Collonels of Horse in the Army, to desire their Agreeing and
Sign∣ing to the Address: And when I told Collonel <HI>Nevil</HI> of it, he
said, he was as great a Servant to the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> and had as good
an Opi∣nion of him as any Person in the Army, well knowing that his
Lordship had long and faith∣fully served the King; but yet, whoever the
King should set over him, he would obey: And added, that he thought not
fit, at that Time especially, to dispute the King's Commands, when they
were going to attack the Enemy; and that therefore he would have no Hand in the
Address, and desired the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> to excuse him: And it
was upon this Considera∣tion that I chose Collonel <HI>Nevil</HI> to
command that Detachment, tho' I knew it was not his Turn to go; in which he
acted to the Gene∣ral's great Satisfaction, who had ever after a great Esteem
and Value for him.</P>
<P>At my Return to the King with the Message of General
<HI>Goring,</HI> the King forthwith marched with his Army towards him, who not
only made good the Post where he was, but, upon the Earl of
<HI>Brentford</HI>'s drawing and advancing farther, (who then commanded the
Army in chief under the King) and reviewing the Sci∣tuation of
<HI>Essex</HI>'s Army, which then began to <PB N="108" REF="129"/> retire
towards <HI>Foy,</HI> the King's Army did there∣upon advance nearer the Enemy,
and the King's General Head Quarters were settled at <HI>Bucon∣nock,</HI> the
Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s House, and Sir <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> was ordered,
with some Regiments of Foot, to fix them at the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI>'s
House, a strong Quarters opposite to the King's, on the other Side the
Valley; at the Head of which Valley a strong Guard of Horse was ordered to
be constantly kept, to keep in the Enemy; our whole Army being encamped on
both Sides the Valley, which prevented the Enemy from making any Excursion
that Way. But, because the rest of <HI>Cornwal</HI> behind the Enemy was
open, it was thought necessary to send a strong Detachment thither, to
stop their Passage on that Side. Whereupon General <HI>Goring</HI> was
sent with the greatest Part of the Horse to St. <HI>Blase</HI> Bridge,
which was the only Passage by which the Ene∣my could enlarge their Quarters
on that Side. Sir <HI>Thomas Basset,</HI> a <HI>Cornish</HI> Man, was
likewise sent thither with his Tertia of Foot, and I was with his
Excellency. The Enemy, by this Disposition of our Army, finding they were
encompassed on all Sides, and that it was im∣possible to break through
with their whole Ar∣my, without apparent Ruine, resolved to chuse the
least Evil, and that their Horse, being about Two Thousand, should
attempt in the Night to break thro' the Valley between both Armies, which
succeeding, they might march with great Diligence, and pass the River at
<HI>Saltash,</HI> before our Army could overtake them, <PB N="109" REF="130"/>
and so get to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that <HI>Essex</HI> should take
Shipping at <HI>Foy,</HI> and meet his Horse at <HI>Plymouth</HI>; and that
Major General <HI>Skippon,</HI> who commanded the Infantry, should stay
with them, to defend them as long as he could, and at last make Articles for
them, being caught in a Net. This Resolution being taken, it was put in
Execution the next Night; and Gene∣ral <HI>Goring</HI> being at St.
<HI>Blase,</HI> a Soldier from the King's Quarters, for Orders brought a
Letter without any Seal, written in great Haste by the King himself, in
these Words: <HI>Goring, the Enemy have, this Night past, broke thro' our
Quarters with their Horse, after some Resistance made by our Horse
Guard commanded by</HI> Cleve∣land, <HI>who was not able to hinder their
Passage, being near five times his Number. They were like to have
surprized Sir</HI> Edward Waldgrave<HI>'s Brigade in their Passage; but
he having some Notice of their March, prevented them. They are gone in great.
Haste, without Bag or Bag∣gage, towards</HI> Saltash, <HI>commanded by
Sir</HI> Wil∣liam Balfour. <HI>Some of our Horse are gone to stop their
Passage at</HI> Saltash, <HI>if it be possible: You must therefore
immediately march after them with all your Horse, and leave</HI> Butler
<HI>with the Foot to keep St.</HI> Blase <HI>Bridge.</HI> The General got his
Army together forthwith, and marched after the Enemy with great Diligence, but
was told by some Troops that followed them from the King's Quarters, that it
was impossible to overtake them, they being returned upon that Account.
Upon this Information, which the <PB N="110" REF="131"/> General had from some
considerable Officers, who had followed the Enemy to no Purpose, his
Excellency thought fit to return, and sent the Horse to their Quarters, and
went to tell the King, he had been able to do nothing of what he had commanded.
The General then stayed with the King, where Orders were forth∣with given
concerning the Enemy's Infantry; and upon Assurance that the Earl of
<HI>Essex,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> and several others, were
gone by Sea to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that their Foot Army began early in the
Morning to retire towards <HI>Foy,</HI> in Hopes to find Ships there to
transport them to their General <HI>Essex</HI> at <HI>Ply∣mouth:</HI> The
King's Army hereupon, being in their Rear, pressed them so close, that
they were forced to fight from Hedge to Hedge, be∣ing in an inclosed Country;
and tho' they were many times put to a disorderly Retreat, how∣ever they
fought till the Night parted us. The next Morning early Major General
<HI>Skippon</HI> sent Collonel <HI>Butler</HI> to desire a Parly, which
being accepted, and Hostages delivered, the Treaty began that Morning in the
King's Quar∣ters, and Articles were soon agreed upon, all Arms, Cannon and
Ammunition, to be delive∣red with their Carriages. We took Fifty Pieces of
Brass Cannon, Three Hundred Barrels of Powder, with Match and Ball
proportionable, Seven Hundred Carriages, between Nine and Ten Thousand Arms,
and many common Sol∣diers deserted, and those who stayed, marched off
only with Sticks in their Hands; but all <PB N="111" REF="132"/> Collonels and
Field Officers were on Horseback, with their Swords only, with Major General
<HI>Skippon</HI> in the Head of the Army, who carried his Loss with a very
good Grace, and they were to be conducted to <HI>Winchester.</HI></P>
<P>Collonel <HI>Thomas Bulstrode,</HI> my Cousin Ger∣man, had
there a Foot Regiment, and I pre∣vailed with General <HI>Goring,</HI> that, if
I could disengage him from that Service, he should be well received, and
have the same Command in our Army: And, in order to this, I accompa∣nied him
two Days, and shewed him all the Kindness I could, and used my best
Endeavours to take him off from that Party; but he was so bigotted, and
seduced by the Zealots of that Army, that I could prevail nothing with him,
who told me plainly, he was resolved to suffer with his Brethren (as he
called them) rather than to quit them, or accept of any Employ∣ment I could
offer him: And added, that his Father was Governour of <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> and
had raised at his own Expences two Regiments for the Parliament, and that he
was resolved to run the same Fortune with the rest of his Com∣rades, and
therefore desired I would not press him farther in that against which he
had taken a final Resolution; and so I left him as I found him, wilful,
stubborn, and full of rebellious Principles.</P>
<P>This Defeat of their Army in <HI>Cornwal</HI> was certainly of
very great Consequence; for, tho' their Horse escaped, yet most of
their Foot were destroyed by their long and tedious March 
<PB N="112" REF="133"/> thro' an Enemy's Country, wanting Provisions and
Necessaries, especially thro' <HI>Cornwal</HI> and <HI>Devonshire,</HI>
which were great Enemies to them, and all our Army of Horse marching at the
same time near them, towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> and our Infantry followed; so
that the Country People would scarce give them Provisions for Money. They
found the same also in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> the Country People being
usually for the strongest Party, and the King's Affairs at that time run
very smoothly: And tho' the Parliament Offi∣cers did always lessen their
Defeats, and enlarge their Victories, yet this Loss of theirs was so
visible, that it gave great Reputation to the King's Affairs, and many
scurvy Reflections were made upon <HI>Essex</HI>'s leaving the Army,
which did proceed (as was publickly said) ei∣ther out of Fear or Cowardice,
neither of which was believed by thinking Men, knowing that the Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> durst fight, and had fought, and very well deserved of
the Parliament be∣fore; and therefore they were rather of Opi∣nion, that
<HI>Essex</HI> finding more of their Inten∣tions, who managed the great
Design in the House of Commons, than was at first imparted to him, he
saw no Way would bring the leading Members in both Houses to a Compliance
with the King, in those peaceable Propositions his Majesty made to them,
by his Letters, not only after <HI>Waller</HI>'s Defeat at <HI>Cropredy,</HI>
but after his signal Victory in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> than by keeping things as
near as his Excellency could, in an equal Ba∣lance. However, it was generally
known, that <PB N="113" REF="134"/> there were great Designs against
<HI>Essex,</HI> many being very desirous to remove him from his Sta∣tion
of General, upon their Jealousy that he was too much inclined to Peace, tho'
we found no such thing from him, neither had the Parlia∣ment any Reason to
believe it; for, by raising the Siege of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> which
<HI>Essex</HI> had done with great Dexterity, he did the Parliament so
great Service, that they could never sufficiently acknowledge it; that Siege
having been one of the greatest Misfortunes that happened to King
<HI>Charles,</HI> during the War; and those who advised the King to it,
either thro' Ignorance or Malice, did more Mischief to the King's Affairs,
than the greatest of his Enemies: For if the King had marched towards
<HI>London,</HI> when he sat down before <HI>Gloucester,</HI> he had, in
all hu∣man Appearance, made an End of the War. But this King was very ill
served in his Wars, thro' too much Fire and Heat in some of his Generals,
by their frequent Factions among themselves, wherein the King found
Difficulty enough to reconcile them, even where he was in Person, and divers
sudden Changes were made afterwards, which proved very disadvan∣tageous to
the King. This was the Time, when really those that wished well to the
King, yet sacrificed his Security to their Animosities against each
other, without any Design of Treachery, but to the King's irreparable
Da∣mage: A Time, in which Want of Discretion produced as much Mischief as
the most plain Villainy; for the King suffered as much by 
<PB N="114" REF="135"/> the Faction of his Counsellours, by their not
foreseeing what was evident, and by their Jea∣lousies of what was not like
to be; they often deliberated too long without Resolution, and as often
resolved without deliberating, and ne∣ver executed rigorously what was
resolved up∣on; and all went to wreck by Negligence, In∣advertency, and
Dejection of Spirit. It was in this Year that the Queen was delivered at
<HI>Exeter</HI> of the Princess <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> who was put into
the Hands of the Lady <HI>Dalkeith</HI>; after which the Queen took Shipping at
<HI>Pen∣dennis</HI> Castle in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and arrived safely in
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Before the King left <HI>Buconnock</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI>
several Addresses were made to him in the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Behalf;
but the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> being then Secretary of State, still delayed the
Business; the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> in the mean time, being first sent
Prisoner to <HI>Exeter,</HI> from thence to <HI>Barnstable.</HI> At last,
upon the King's being daily importuned in that Affair, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>
gave this Answer from the King, and that they were to expect no other, which
was as follows. <HI>That, upon the Earl of</HI> Essex<HI>'s marching
into</HI> Cornwal, <HI>it was resolved at a Cabinet Council, where the
Lord</HI> Wilmot <HI>was, That the King should write with his own Hand to the
Earl of</HI> Essex, <HI>offering him what Conditions he pleased, if he
would lay down his Arms, come to the King, and leave his Army to the King's
Mercy; and it was precisely ordered by the King in Coun∣cil, that no Person
should take Notice of that</HI> <PB N="115" REF="136"/> <HI>Letter, or send
any Message to the Earl of</HI> Essex: <HI>That, notwithstanding this
particular Command of the King's, the Lord</HI> Wilmot <HI>bid him that carried
the Letter, to remember his Service to the Earl of</HI> Essex,
<HI>desiring he would lay hold of the Opportunity then offered, assu∣ring
him the King should make good his Word, and that he</HI> (<HI>the Lord</HI>
Wilmot) <HI>would take Care the Courtiers should not hinder it, nor car∣ry
things as they had done.</HI> Upon this Answer the Officers gave over their
Pursuit of any farther Addresses, and the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> was no
farther questioned, but went into <HI>France</HI> at the End of the War, and
was the chief Person that saved the Life of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after
his Defeat at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and carried him safe into
<HI>France,</HI> and was in great Esteem with that King, even to his Death;
and his Disgrace under King <HI>Charles</HI> I. was look'd upon purely as an
Effect of the Power General <HI>Goring</HI> had at that time with the King, who
had certainly all <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Faults, but wanted his Regularity, and
preserving his Respects with the Officers. <HI>Wilmot</HI> always shut
Debauchery out of his Bu∣siness, never neglected that, and so rarely
mis∣carried in it: <HI>Goring</HI> had a sharper Wit, and much a keener
Courage and Presence of Mind in Danger, in which <HI>Wilmot</HI> could not
behave himself so well, and therefore warily declined it, as he did near
<HI>Southam,</HI> at the Beginning of the War, when the King was near
<HI>Coventry,</HI> before his Standard was set up; and for missing that
Opportunity of Fighting, his Lordship <PB N="116" REF="137"/> was much blamed.
<HI>Wilmot</HI> never drank, when he was within Distance of an Enemy, and
<HI>Goring</HI> seldom or never refused it, and could not resist
Temptations; and therefore he had always much Company, and few Friends, and he
loved no Man so well, but he would cozen him, and then laugh at him for being
cozened.</P>
<P>About this Time, General <HI>Goring</HI> was sent for with his
Forces to the King, and upon his first coming, lying at <HI>Bampton in the
Bush,</HI> he defeated the Enemy, which gave him such Re∣putation, that he
was sent into the West with full Power as Generalissimo, and General of
all the Horse of <HI>England.</HI> His Excellency then went to
<HI>Taunton,</HI> and besieged it, which Place was reduced to some
Necessity, when Collonel <HI>Graves</HI> came to relieve it: Whereupon the
Ge∣neral drew up the Hills, whilst <HI>Graves</HI> put some Recruits and
Provisions into the Town. At the same time the General sent Sir <HI>John
Digby,</HI> Major General of the Horse, with a great Detachment, to fall upon
Collonel <HI>Graves</HI> in his Retreat; in which Action Sir <HI>John
Dig∣by</HI> had good Success, and took many Prisoners: But being shot in
the Arm, he was sent to <HI>Bridg∣water,</HI> to be cured; but his Arm
gangrened, and he there died, to the great Regret of the Army, and of all that
knew him. So soon as <HI>Graves</HI> was retired, General <HI>Goring</HI>
drew down his Army again to besiege <HI>Taunton,</HI> which put the
Garrison into greater Consternation than before, believing the King must
have had some extraordinary Success, which made our Gene∣ral 
<PB N="117" REF="138"/> take those Measures. We pressed them so hard,
that we were like to be soon Masters of the Place, but that an unlucky
Accident hap∣pened, of Sir <HI>William Courtney</HI>'s and Collonel
<HI>Thornhill</HI>'s falling foul upon each other, in∣stead of the Enemy,
which was a great Misfor∣tune; and tho' the Governour, <HI>Blague,</HI>
defen∣ded the Place very bravely, we were likely to be Masters of it in a
very little time.</P>
<P>But I must not forget, that, after the Defeat in
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> the King staying some time in the Western Parts,
<HI>Essex</HI> got together another Ar∣my, and being joined with
<HI>Waller</HI> and <HI>Man∣chester,</HI> was then so strong, that he
hoped to take his Revenge, and encompass the King, who was then going to
<HI>Oxford,</HI> taking <HI>Newbury</HI> in his Way. <HI>Essex,</HI> with
his Army, had made his Rendezvous in <HI>Aldermarston</HI> Park, belonging to
Sir <HI>Humphrey Foster</HI>; from whence he came more suddenly upon us
than we expected, which put us into some Confusion. They attacked us at the
same time in several Places, with diffe∣rent Success, being much
stronger than we; and when they could not prevail in one Place, they attack'd
us in another, hoping in the End to surround us: So that there was fighting
at the same time in several Places, in most of which the Enemy prevailed,
and we retired, and were upon the Defensive in all Parts. Upon the West
Side of <HI>Spine</HI> they pressed us very hard, where young Sir <HI>John
Greenvil</HI> was posted up∣on a high Rising Ground, with some Foot and
Cannon, with a small Retrenchment before him: <PB N="118" REF="139"/> General
<HI>Goring</HI> being then on that Side, and see∣ing the Enemy intended to
attack that Place with Horse and Foot, to prevent which, he resolved to
charge their Horse with the Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI>'s Brigade, which was
then drawn up on that Side, which was done accordingly: But the Earl of
<HI>Cleveland</HI> engaging his Person too far, was there taken Prisoner,
and then a great Body of the Enemy's Foot advanced in good Order upon Sir
<HI>John Greenvil,</HI> forced him from that Post, with the Loss of some
Men and Cannon, and himself wounded in the Head with a Sword in this Action.
Upon this Success, the Enemy pursued furiously, and the Fight continued
very hot, the Enemy still advancing: Where∣upon I was commanded by General
<HI>Goring,</HI> to bring up the Queen's Regiment of Horse, which was then in
Reserve, commanded by Sir <HI>John Cansfield,</HI> who charged them so
home, that he stopp'd their Career, and obliged them to re∣treat, which gave
some breathing Time to our Troops on that Side; but in this Action Sir
<HI>John Cansfield</HI> had one of his Legs shot and broken: And while we
were thus fighting on that Side of <HI>Spine, Manchester,</HI> with his
Ar∣my, attacked Mr. <HI>Doleman</HI>'s House at <HI>Shaw,</HI> below the
Castle, where there was a sharp En∣gagement all that Afternoon, and the
Garden was warmly attacked, and as well defended, by the Collonels
<HI>Lisle</HI> and <HI>Thelwell,</HI> with the Help of Sir <HI>Thomas
Hooper</HI>'s Dragoons; and a little before the Evening, Sir <HI>John
Brown,</HI> with the Prince's Regiment of Horse, charged the Ene∣my 
<PB N="119" REF="140"/> so briskly, that he obliged them to retreat up the
Hill, with the Loss of some Colours, and two Field Pieces of Cannon. Thus
the Fight continued on all Sides, till the Night parted us. The King stayed
in the Field till Midnight, that all our Cannon were drawn within the Walls of
<HI>Dennington</HI> Castle, for their Security, and then General
<HI>Goring,</HI> with most of the Army, marched that Night towards
<HI>Oxford,</HI> without any Alarm from the Enemy, who durst not follow us,
and the King went to <HI>Bristol.</HI> The next Day, after our Retreat,
<HI>Essex</HI> possess'd himself very quietly of <HI>Newbury,</HI>
making little Doubt of taking <HI>Dennington</HI> Ca∣stle, which was thrice
summoned, and as often stormed, but without Success; and finding it would
be a Work of Time, and nothing was to be got there but Blows, he retired with
his Army, and quitted <HI>Newbury</HI>; to which Place General <HI>Goring</HI>
soon came again, relieved the Castle with what was wanting, and brought off
all our Cannon.</P>
<P>The Parliament finding that <HI>Newbury</HI> was quitted, not only
without, but against their Order, and all the Cannon brought away from
<HI>Dennington</HI> Castle, tho' the Parliament Armies were more than double
to the Number of the King's, they were much displeased at the Pro∣ceedings
of <HI>Essex,</HI> which being joined with great Aspersions of his ill
Conduct in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> made the Parliament resolve to new model their
Army, which they would do with great Policy, by Degrees, that the less Notice
might be taken <PB N="120" REF="141"/> of it. In order to this, they first
made a Self-denying Ordinance (as they called it) that after such a prefixed
Time (which was then declared) no Member of either House of Par∣liament
should enjoy any Office either Civil or Military.</P>
<P>The Winter following this Year, General <HI>Goring</HI> was
quartered at <HI>Bruton</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> at Sir <HI>Charles
Berkeley</HI>'s, a great inclosed Coun∣try, where the Villages were thick,
and great Store of Forage For Horse. Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> was then
quartered at <HI>Salisbury</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> where the Villages are
thin, standing only in the Valleys, some Distance from each other.
General <HI>Goring</HI> taking this Advantage, sent out Parties, almost
every Night, to beat up the Enemy's Quarters in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> which was
done with such good Success, that in a short time we took many
Prisoners and Colours, which occa∣sioned <HI>Waller</HI> to write this
ensuing Letter to General <HI>Goring. Noble Lord, God's Blessing he on
your Heart, you are the jolliest Neighbour I have ever met with: I wish for
nothing more, but an Opportunity to let you know, I would not be behind in this
kind of Courtesy. In the mean time, if your Lordship please to release
such Prisoners as you have of mine, for the like Num∣ber and Quality that I
have of yours, I shall esteem it as a great Civility, being your
Lord∣ship's most Humble and Obedient Servant,</HI></P>
<P>William Waller.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="142"/>This Letter was brought by a Trumpeter, who
had been often with us, and was well known to us, and was a good pleasant
Droll; and whilst we were at Dinner in the General's Quarters, a Party of
Horse returned, with five Colours, and several Prisoners of Collonel
<HI>Popham</HI>'s Regiment, whose Quarters were beaten up the Night before.
Upon this the General sent for the Trumpeter into the Room, where we were at
Dinner, to shew him the Colours, and the principal Prisoners: Whereupon the
Trumpeter pressed his Excellency to dispatch him back with his Answer,
fearing, if he should stay longer, that <HI>Waller</HI> himself might be
taken, before he, the Trumpeter, could reach <HI>Salisbu∣ry</HI>; and so he
was dispatched with this Answer from the General: <HI>That if Sir</HI>
William Waller <HI>had Authority, and could nominate two Officers of Quality,
of his Army, to meet two Officers of the like Quality, of General</HI>
Goring<HI>'s Army, at any convenient Place between both Armies, they should
be empowered to exchange all Priso∣ners on both Sides, of equal Quality, from
the</HI> Lands-End <HI>in</HI> Cornwal, <HI>to</HI> Portsmouth <HI>in</HI>
Hamp∣shire: Which Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> willingly ac∣cepted, and
accordingly named Collonel <HI>Ennis,</HI> his Adjutant General, and Major
<HI>Butler,</HI> who was Major to <HI>Waller</HI>'s own Regiment, and desired
<HI>Shaftsbury</HI> might be the Place of Meeting. To this the General
willingly consented, and sent a Pass by the same Trumpeter, for the
Persons na∣med by Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> and at the same time
nominated me with Sir <HI>Bernard Gascoigne,</HI> Ma∣jor 
<PB N="122" REF="143"/> to his own Regiment, Commissioners from his
Excellency: And accordingly a Pass was sent us forthwith from Sir
<HI>William Waller,</HI> and the Time appointed for our Meeting at
<HI>Shafts∣bury,</HI> to which Place we all came the same Day with our
Servants, and Trumpeters with each. The Country People believing we were
appoin∣ted to make a Peace, flocked in great Numbers to <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI>
where we stayed fifteen Days, to release all Prisoners of Quality on both
Sides, from the <HI>Lands-End</HI> in the West, to <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> Sir
<HI>William Waller</HI> sent us a great Present of Wines, which came from
<HI>London,</HI> believing we could have none such elsewhere. We then
appointed all our Prisoners to be brought to <HI>Wareham</HI> in
<HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and all the Prisoners of the Parliament's Side, to
be brought to <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Hampshire</HI>; and Sir
<HI>Bernard Gascoigne</HI> went to <HI>Wareham,</HI> to receive our
Prisoners, and Major <HI>Butler</HI> went to <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> to
receive the Parliament's. Collonel <HI>Ennis</HI> returned to
<HI>Salisbury,</HI> and I came back to <HI>Bruton,</HI> to give the Generals an
Account of what we had done.</P>
<P>Now, the King having often sollicited the Parliament for Peace,
even after both his Victories, at <HI>Cropredy</HI> Bridge, and in
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> and the Parliament seeing the general In∣clination of the
People and City of <HI>London</HI> bend that way, that they might seem at
least to have the same Desires for the Good of the Na∣tion, (tho' it
plainly appeared they otherwise intended) the Parliament, with the Consent
of the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> present some 
<PB N="123" REF="144"/> Propositions to the King, which they desire may be
treated on at <HI>Uxbridge:</HI> To which Treaty the King soon agreed, when
it was well known the Parliament never intended to come to an Agreement, by
their most irrational and unjust Demands, which they knew, the King could
neither in Reason, Honour, or Consci∣ence, grant; and so the Treaty was
soon bro∣ken, to the King's great Dissatisfaction, who then clearly
saw, the Parliament was resolved to prosecute the War against him, to
the last Extremity.</P>
<P>About this time, the great Designs against <HI>Essex</HI>
began to appear, who was much suspected by those who designed to
destroy both Govern∣ment, Ministry, and Magistracy, and resolved to
remove the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> from his Command, and took Resolutions
to put the Self-denying Ordinance in Execution: But <HI>Essex,
Manche∣ster,</HI> and <HI>Denbigh,</HI> forthwith surrendered their
Commissions; the same did likewise the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> their
Admiral, they being all fully perswaded, by the Parliament's Procee∣ding,
that they intended to perpetuate them∣selves, and the usurped Government of
the three Nations, and to make themselves a free State, under a
Presbyterian Government. But the Parliament were much mistaken in their
Policy, and were soon deprived of their main Design, and quickly lost all
that Dominion which they so eagerly desired, and so long ga∣ped for, it
being presently snatched out of their Hands, by the Independent Party, who
were <PB N="124" REF="145"/> newly sprung up out of their own Bowels: For
notwithstanding their Self-Denying Ordinance, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was
dispensed with to hold his Com∣mand of Lieutenant General to Sir <HI>Thomas
Fairfax,</HI> who was made General of their new modelled Army, whose first
Rendezvous was at <HI>Windsor,</HI> where they did their own Business,
and quite ruined the King's.</P>
<P>The first Success by this new modelled Ar∣my was performed by
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> who wasting the Country with a Body of Horse, fell
unex∣pectedly upon a Party at <HI>Islip</HI> Bridge, comman∣ded by the Earl
of <HI>Northampton,</HI> who were defeated, and some Prisoners taken, and
the Remainder pursued to <HI>Bleckington House,</HI> four Miles from
<HI>Oxford,</HI> where Collonel <HI>Windebank</HI> was settled for some
time, with a small Party of Horse and Foot. <HI>Cromwell</HI> presently
summo∣ned the House, which had only a Wall about it; the Governour
forthwith surrendered it, and had Articles to retire to <HI>Oxford</HI>;
where be∣ing called to a Council of War, he was con∣demned, and shot to
Death, for delivering it so soon to a Party of Horse only, when he might
have had speedy Assistance from <HI>Oxford,</HI> which was but four
Miles from <HI>Bleckington.</HI></P>
<P>About this time, General <HI>Goring</HI> was at the Siege of
<HI>Taunton,</HI> of which he was in great Hopes soon to be Master, (at
least he made us all believe so) when he received Letters from the King
(some Days before his taking of <HI>Lei∣cester</HI>) commanding him to quit
the Siege of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and hasten to him with his Army, 
<PB N="125" REF="146"/> fearing the Enemy would be too strong for him: To
which I wrote the General's Answer to the King, having kept the Copy of it,
which was to this Effect. <HI>That he was certain, in few Days, to be Master
of</HI> Taunton, <HI>and should leave that Country free from any Enemy,
excep∣ting</HI> Lyme <HI>(which was then, and had been for some Time blocked
up;) whereas, if he should leave the Siege, the Enemy would be Masters of
that Country; and therefore he most humbly prayed the King, to forbear any
Engagement, and to be upon the Defensive, upon the River of</HI> Trent,
<HI>which he might very well do, till the Siege of</HI> Taunton <HI>was ended,
and then he would bring his Army to serve the King to his best Advantage;
and he did again desire the King to keep at a Distance, and not
engage.</HI> But the taking of <HI>Leicester</HI> being a great Loss to the
Parliament, and of such Advantage to the King, that his Majesty then wrote
to the Queen, that he might (without being too much sanguine) af∣firm, that,
since the Rebellion began, his Affairs were never in so hopeful a Way; and
indeed the Parliament was then likewise of the same Opi∣nion. But this
Letter from the General being intercepted by <HI>Fairfax,</HI> caused his
sudden Ad∣vance from his Rendezvous at <HI>Brickhill,</HI> to send in great
Haste for <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who was gone into the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI>
upon whose Return a Resolu∣tion was taken to engage the King forthwith to a
Battle, before the Loss of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and that General <HI>Goring</HI>
should arrive with his Army. Now, the King, not having Advice from Ge∣neral 
<PB N="126" REF="147"/> <HI>Goring,</HI> by his Letter being intercepted, and
both his and his Soldiers Spirits being much heightened by taking of
<HI>Leicester,</HI> and the King hearing the Enemy was advancing to∣wards
him, a Council was forthwith called at Midnight, where it was resolved to
give the Enemy Battle the next Day; to which the King then prepared, and had in
all Appearance gained a Victory, if Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> (who was some∣time
before made Lieutenant General of all the King's Armies, in Place of the Earl
of <HI>Brentford</HI>) had not, after his usual Manner, having defeated the
Enemy's left Wing, pursued furiously so far, as to leave the Foot naked,
who were severely fallen upon by the Enemy's Reserve of Horse, who had
put them in great Disorder, and the whole Army was almost to∣tally broken,
before the Prince came back to to their Relief, tho' the King in Person (to
the great Hazard of his Life) did all that possibly could be done by
Valour, in rallying his Horse, and endeavouring to maintain the Battle; but
seeing all lost, the King was forced to fly to∣wards <HI>Leicester,</HI>
for his own Safety, leaving the Enemy wholly Masters of the Field. The Loss
of all was Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s pursuing the Horse, which he had
beaten, whose natural Heat and Impatience was such, that he could not
endure the Enemy in View, nor would he believe the Enemy had Courage to endure
his Charge; and thus the Army was engaged, be∣fore the Cannon was turned, or
the Ground made choice of, upon which they were to fight: <PB N="127" REF="148"/> So that Courage was only to be relied on, where all Conduct failed.
However, if the King had then gone directly into the West, where he had an
Army ready formed, and People generally devoted to his Service, instead of
amusing him∣self about forming a new Army in Countries worn out with the
Oppression of his own Troops, and the Licence of their Governours, he might
have given the Enemy a great Interruption, if not restored his Affairs. Thus
this fatal Battle of <HI>Naseby,</HI> fought the 14th of <HI>June,</HI>
proved the entire Ruine of all the King's Affairs. The King, after this Battle,
fled from Place to Place, not well knowing which Way to turn himself: At
last he came to <HI>Newark,</HI> where he received a new Mortification from
his Subjects then in Arms for him, much sharper than any he had received from
the Enemy, which he suffered with more Grief and Perplexity of Mind. Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> after the Loss of the West and
<HI>Bristol,</HI> were at <HI>Belvoir</HI> Castle, where the King commanded
them to stay, and not to follow him to <HI>Newark</HI>; but, contrary to the
King's Commands, they both came thither, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> told his
Ma∣jesty, he was come to give an Account of the Loss of <HI>Bristol,</HI>
and to clear himself from those Imputations that had been cast upon him
for the Surrender of that Place. Tho' the King was displeased with the
Prince's coming thither, contrary to his Orders, he was yet resolved to hear
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Defence, who had promi∣sed the King to hold
<HI>Bristol</HI> at least four Months, <PB N="128" REF="149"/> and yet gave
it up almost in as few Days: And he told Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> that he did
really be∣lieve, the Prince had no Design against his Ser∣vice, and that he
would command a Declaration to be drawn up, by which the Prince should be
absolved from any Disloyalty, either in that, or any other Action of the
War; but that in Truth he could not absolve him of Indiscretion in the
Delivery of <HI>Bristol.</HI> The King resolved to retreat from
<HI>Newark</HI> towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> because the Enemy were on the North
Side of <HI>Trent,</HI> but he imparted his Resolution to none; except to two
or three of the nearest Trust about him; and finding great Differences grow
betwixt Sir <HI>Richard Willis,</HI> the Governour, and the Gentlemen of the
Country, who were firm to him, and whose Interest alone had preserved
that Place; and finding no Way to preserve that Garrison, but by Removal of
the Gover∣nour, he sent for him into his Bed-chamber, and after many gracious
Expressions of the Sa∣tisfaction he had received in his Service, he told
him, his Design was to go that Night, and to take him with him, and to make
him Captain of his Guards, in Place of the Earl of <HI>Litch∣field,</HI> who
was lately killed near <HI>Chester,</HI> and would leave Collonel
<HI>Bellasis</HI> Governour there, who being allied to most of the Gentry
of the adjacent Counties, would be more acceptable to them; and that he could
not give a more ample Justification of his Services, and of his Satis∣faction
in them, than by the Honour and Trust he conferred upon him. Sir <HI>Richard
Willis</HI> <PB N="129" REF="150"/> appeared much troubled, and excused his
taking the other Command, as a Place of too great Honour, and that his Fortune
could not maintain him in that Employment, and said, his Enemies would
triumph in his Removal. The King told him, he would take Care and provide for
his Support, and so went out of his Chamber to Church; and after his Return,
being at Dinner, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Prince <HI>Mau∣rice,</HI> Lord
<HI>Gerard,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Willis,</HI> with about Twenty Officers of
the Garrison, came into the Presence-Chamber, where Sir <HI>Richard
Willis</HI> addressed himself to the King, and told him, it was the
publick Talk of the Town, that he was disgraced, and turned out from his
Government; and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> added, Sir <HI>Richard Willis</HI> was
to be removed from his Go∣vernment, for no other Fault, but for being his
Friend. The Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> said, it was a Plot of the Lord
<HI>Digby,</HI> who was a Traitor, and he would prove him to be so. The King
was so much surprized at these extravagant and insolent Discourses,
that he rose from Dinner in great Disorder, and retiring into his
Bed∣chamber, he called Sir <HI>Richard Willis</HI> to follow him, who
answered loudly, that he had re∣ceived a publick Injury, and expected a
publick Satisfaction. This so provoked his Majesty, that, with much greater
Indignation than ever he was seen possessed with, he commanded them
to depart his Presence, and to come no more into it; and this with such
Circumstances in his Looks and Gesture, as well as Words, that 
<PB N="130" REF="151"/> they appeared no less confounded, and departed the
Room, ashamed of what they had done: Yet so soon as they came to the
Governour's House, they sounded to Horse, intending to be presently
gone; but soon after they sent to the King for Passes, who gave them
such as they desired, and sent them, and declared Collonel
<HI>Bellasis</HI> Governour of <HI>Newark,</HI> but forgot at the same time
to have hanged up Sir <HI>Richard Willis,</HI> for his insolent Carriage
towards his Sovereign.</P>
<P>After this the King went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> sent several
Messages for Peace, and for a present Treaty; that he would come to
<HI>London,</HI> and put himself into their Hands: But nothing would be
accepted. And tho' he tried to deal with the Independants, yet it was in vain;
the King's ill Success run on in a continued Series, in this Year 1645, he
lost more in three Months than he had gotten before in three Years. The
<HI>French</HI> seemed glad of these Disorders amongst us, Cardinal
<HI>Richlieu</HI> having had an implacable Malice and Hatred to
<HI>England,</HI> ever since the Isle of <HI>Rhee</HI> Voyage, and the
declared Protecti∣on of <HI>Rochel</HI> against the King; and he being now
dead, and Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> in his Place, an <HI>Italian,</HI> who
seemed very kind to the Queen, but yet gave very little and ordinary
Supplies, that he might a little continue the Struggle; but he was more
sollicitous to keep a good Corre∣spondence with the Parliament, and to
profess a Neutrality betwixt the King and the Parlia∣ment, by means of
<HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> <PB N="131" REF="152"/> the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Ambassador, who made all his Ad∣dresses to the Parliament. But that
which put a Period to all our King's Hopes, was the De∣feating the Lord
<HI>Astley</HI> near <HI>Stow in the Wold,</HI> who was taken Prisoner with
several other Offi∣cers, and were all either killed or dispersed, as they
were coming from <HI>Worcester</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> which hindred the
King from drawing any other Troops into the Field; and being now in the Ebb of
his good Fortunes, he thought it in vain to expect a Treaty with his
Parliament, who, in the Height of his good Success, would listen to no
Reason: Yet, to satisfy his Friends, who were generally inclined to Peace,
he sent a Message to his Parliament, full of tender Ex∣pressions,
setting forth his deep Sense of the Nation's Miseries, by these civil
Distractions amongst them, and conjured them, as they would answer it to
Almighty God, in that Day when he should make Inquisition for Blood, which
had, or might be spilt, in that unnatu∣ral War; and as they tendred the
Preservation of their Religion, by all the Bonds of Duty and Allegiance to
their King, of Compassion for their bleeding Country, or Charity to
them∣selves, to dispose their Hearts to a true Sense, and to employ
their Faculties to a more serious Endeavour, together with his Majesty, to
put a speedy End to these wasting Divisions, and to make both King and
People happy. But this Message produced nothing, but much more in∣solent
Propositions than those at <HI>Uxbridge</HI>; and it was in vain for the
King to expostulate with <PB N="132" REF="153"/> them who were resolved not
to give him any reasonable Satisfaction: And tho' the House of Lords was
willing to correspond with the King's Desires, yet they were over-ruled and
curbed by the Commons, the Lords then standing but as Cyphers, and were
forced by the Commons into a Compliance, in whatever they desired or
determined; and if the Lords dissented to any Particular, they would do it
without them, the active Commons doing all things at their Plea∣sure: Which
did sufficiently demonstrate, that they had no Intention to come to any
Agreement of Peace, but to pursue their Designs to the uttermost Round of
the Ladder; and having once drawn their Swords against their lawful Prince,
to throw away the Scabbard, knowing their Crimes could not be safe, but by
attempt∣ing greater: And tho' the Design was hatched in the House of
Commons, for the Extirpation of Monarchy, yet I really believe the tenth Part
of them never knew, nor thought, that the Business would go so far, as at
last it did, they looking no farther than the bare Outside of Things, which
carried a fair Shew and Gloss, to fight for King and Parliament, and were
in∣sensibly drawn in by the Insinuation of the prevailing Party.</P>
<P>The King found all his Endeavours for Peace signified nothing,
that the Commons were re∣solved upon his Ruine, and that nothing would
serve but his Submission to all they demanded, against which he was
absolutely resolved, it being his Obligation in Honour and Conscience, 
<PB N="133" REF="154"/> not to abandon a just Cause, nor injure his
Suc∣cessor, nor forsake his Friends; and therefore expected no other
Success, but to end his Days with Honour and a good Conscience, and did
seriously avow, as appeared by his Letter to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
wherein he freely told the Prince, that those who would stay with him, were
to expect and resolve, either to die for a good Cause, or, which was
worse, to live as miserable in maintaining it, as the Insolence of
insulting Rebels could make them.</P>
<P>I must confess, I knew not General <HI>Goring,</HI> till he
came to the King in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> after the Battle of
<HI>Marston-Moor,</HI> but I have heard great Reflections made upon his
Conduct in the Busi∣ness of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> of which he was
Gover∣nour in the Beginning of the War; and most wondered why the King would
employ him, being made General of all the Horse in <HI>England,</HI> and
Generalissimo in the West, both of Horse and Foot. But I believe he had
done some ex∣traordinary Service for our King in <HI>France,</HI> before he
came over with the Queen; and I have been informed from good Hands, that he did
not only procure great Store of Arms and Ammunition, but furnished the Queen
also with a considerable Sum of Money, which he got by his Dexterity and
Cunning; which pre∣vailed so much with the King, that, by the Queen's
Intercession, he gave him those great Commands, which made a mighty
Noise in the Army, and gave great Discontent to many. As to his Person, I
had as much Reason to know <PB N="134" REF="155"/> him as any, and was always
entrusted with his most secret Dispatches; and tho' I know his Memory
remains blasted upon several Occasions, yet I cannot but do him this
Right, which com∣mon Honesty obliges me to say of him: That he was a
Person of extraordinary Abilities, as well as Courage, and was, without
Dispute, as good an Officer as any served the King, and the most
dexterous, in any sudden Emergency, that I have ever seen, and could
extricate himself with the least Concern, of which I was a par∣ticular
Eye-Witness upon several Occasions in the Siege of <HI>Taunton,</HI>
where Collonel <HI>Blague</HI> the then Governour made many sharp and
un∣expected Sallies; but he was still repulsed and beaten back with Loss,
by the Courage and Dexterity of General <HI>Goring,</HI> without which that
Siege had been soon raised. But after all that can be said in General
<HI>Goring</HI>'s Behalf, he had likewise his blind Side, for he strangely
loved the Bottle, was much given to his Plea∣sures, and a great Debauchee;
and the great Misfortune was, when he commanded in chief in the West of
<HI>England,</HI> his Excellency had two Companions, who commanded next under
him, who fed his wild Humour and Debauch, and one of them, if not both, wanted
his great and natural Courage. These two Commanders, the one being Lieutenant
General, made the General turn his Wantonness into Riot, and his Riot into
Madness: So that if the King had been truly informed of their continued
strange Debauches, his Majesty would either have re∣moved 
<PB N="135" REF="156"/> them from him, or all Three from fu∣ture Trust or
Employment: For when Princes give way to the Vices of their Commanders, tho'
they be never so brave Men, they seldom recompense their Neglects by any
future Dili∣gence; for they must stand in Awe of the Prince they serve,
or else the Prince must be Servant to their Humour.</P>
<P>Whilst the Siege of <HI>Taunton</HI> continued, I confess
Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI> had several Conferences with the Officers
of the Rebels that were then in that Garrison, to the great Scan∣dal of many,
who knew not what Interpreta∣tion to make of it; but this being often
practi∣sed among the Chiefs of the Army, much No∣tice was not taken of it.
About this time Ge∣neral <HI>Goring</HI> seemed something discontented
with the Prince's Council; whereupon Sir <HI>John Berkeley,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh
Pollard,</HI> and Collonel <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> were sent to confer with
General <HI>Goring,</HI> to know particularly what he desired. Their
Conference was kept very private; how∣ever, I was informed, that the General
carried himself very extravagantly, and that they could not satisfy him.
Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> being then coming into the West against General
<HI>Goring,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> recommended to him the Garrison
of <HI>Langport,</HI> as being of great Impor∣tance for the Security of
<HI>Bridgwater:</HI> But Ge∣neral <HI>Goring</HI>'s Troops being quartered
about <HI>Langport,</HI> took away the Contribution assigned for the
Support of it, to supply his own Army, which brought the Garrison so low,
that when <PB N="136" REF="157"/> it might have been very advantageous to our
Army, it had very little or no Provision in it. And then, to add to our
Misery, the Clubmen in <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Somersetshire</HI> began
to rise, and sent Complaints to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> of the great
Oppressions and Disorders committed by our Army, which the Prince
promised to re∣form, and went to General <HI>Goring</HI> about it, setting
forth the great Danger the Country was in, by the Liberty his Troops took to
them∣selves. But the General having no Money to give the Army, connived at
the Licence they took, and, at the same time, to shew his Popu∣larity,
sided in many things with the Clubmen, who in the End did us as much
Mischief as the Power of the Rebels, who, about that time, being towards the
Month of <HI>July,</HI> entered <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> and being
suppressed, and agreed with Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> he besieged
and took <HI>Sherborn</HI> Castle, which was well defended by Sir <HI>Lewis
Dives,</HI> who was there taken Prisoner, with Collonel <HI>Strangeways</HI>
and several others. After the taking of <HI>Sherborn,</HI> the Parliament
Army advanced towards General <HI>Goring,</HI> who was encamped about
<HI>Langport,</HI> which, by rea∣son of the River on the one Side, and the
great Marsh or Bogg betwixt that and <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> was esteemed a
strong Post, and likewise to make a good Retreat, in Case we were
beaten. The Day before we engaged, the General sent Lieutenant General
<HI>Porter,</HI> with three Brigades of Horse, on the other Side the River,
farther from the Enemy than we were, and in a Race <PB N="137" REF="158"/>
Campagne, who had his Quarters beaten up at Noon Day, by General
<HI>Massey,</HI> for want of Scouts being out, the Lieutenant General
be∣ing then in his utmost Debauches with some of his Officers. The Enemy
was seen coming from the Hills a Mile before them, and yet was up∣on our Men,
before they could get to their Horses, who were feeding in the Meadows. The
Alarm being brought to General <HI>Goring,</HI> he immediately marched in
Person to his Suc∣cour, rallied the Horse that were flying, stopp'd the
Enemy's Carreer, who were eagerly pursu∣ing, and made a handsome Retreat,
without which the best Part of our Army had been lost that Day; and when
our General met Lieute∣nant General <HI>Porter</HI> in the Rear flying with the
rest, his Excellency turned to me, and said, <HI>He deserves to be
pistoll'd for his Negligence or Cowardice</HI>; but being the General's
Brother-in-Law, that Fault was soon forgotten and pardoned: And yet I have
often heard the Ge∣neral say, <HI>That his Brother-in-Law, Lieutenant
General</HI> Porter, <HI>was the best Company, but the worst Officer, that
ever served the King.</HI></P>
<P>After this Beating up of Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI>'s
Quarters, <HI>Fairfax,</HI> with his Army, marched directly to us from
<HI>Evil,</HI> where, be∣ing a plain and rising Ground, the Enemy's Army was
drawn up upon it, with a great Marsh and Bogg between both Armies, which
hindred the Enemy from attacking us, except by one Passage in the Bottom of
the Hill, between both Armies, which Passage was narrow, and 
<PB N="138" REF="159"/> our General had placed there two Regiments of Foot to
guard that Passage; which were Collo∣nel <HI>Slaughter</HI>'s and Collonel
<HI>Wise</HI>'s Regiments, lately raised in South <HI>Wales.</HI> General
<HI>Goring</HI> himself, with all his Horse, was drawn up upon the Hill, at
the Mouth of the Passage, with the Infantry upon his right Hand, near
<HI>Langport,</HI> to succour those two Regiments, in case of Attack upon
the Pass, which the Gene∣ral hoped to make good, at least till Night, that
then we might retire with less Loss, being unseen. In the mean time,
General <HI>Goring</HI> commanded me to send away all the Baggage and Cannon,
except two Field Pieces, which he commanded should be drawn to the Top of the
Hill, at the Head of the Pass, and bid me to order Sir <HI>Joseph
Wagstaffe</HI> from him, who commanded the Foot near to <HI>Langport,</HI>
that in case the Enemy should force the Pass upon him, that then Sir
<HI>Joseph Wagstaffe</HI> should retire with all his Foot to
<HI>Langport,</HI> and there pass the River towards <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and
burn down the Bridge behind him, which was a Draw-bridge over the River; and,
in the Morning, when I had Orders to send away the Baggage and Cannon, I
sent them that Way, for their greater Security, otherwise they had been all
lost; for we were in Hopes to keep that Pass till Night: Yet so soon as
the Enemy had put their Army in Order of Battle, upon the Top of the Hill, on
the other Side the Bogg, which we thought was their whole Army, they opened and
drew to their Right and Left, advancing <PB N="139" REF="160"/> towards the
Pass, whilst another great Body came up in their Place, by which their Army
was more than double our Number. However, our General neither lost his
Courage nor Con∣duct, but still remained at the Head of the Pass, with his
own Guards of Horse, comman∣ded by Collonel <HI>Patrick Barnwell,</HI> a very
brave <HI>Irish</HI> Gentleman, Son to the Lord <HI>Barnwell</HI>; next to
him was the General's own Regiment of Horse, commanded by Collonel
<HI>Charles Goring,</HI> his Excellency's Brother, who was also seconded by
Sir <HI>Arthur Slingsby,</HI> with his Regiment of Horse, and the rest of
the Horse Army behind him; but the Enemy advancing very fast down the Hill,
with Horse, Foot, Dragoons and Cannon, much overpowered us in Number; and our
Foot that were drawn down to guard the Pass not doing their Duty, many of
them deserting, and shooting against us, the Enemy thereupon gained the
Pass. The General charged the Enemy twice, but being much overpowered in
Number, we were at last beaten off, and obliged to a very disorderly
Re∣treat. The Foot, commanded by Major Gene∣ral <HI>Wagstaffe,</HI> retired
to <HI>Langport</HI>; as did like∣wise the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> and
retreated over the Bridge that Way to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> having broken and
burnt down the Draw-bridge be∣hind them: But our Horse were obliged to
re∣treat the ordinary Way, which being a moorish Ground, full of several
narrow Passes, where several Officers were obliged to stay, to make
good the Retreat for others; so that divers of <PB N="140" REF="161"/>
Distinction were taken, too many to be reckoned up, and among the Prisoners
was Sir <HI>Arthur Slingsby,</HI> but Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI>
esca∣ped that Way, Room being made for him by other Officers. But our
General, with his Brother, Mr. <HI>Barnwell,</HI> Sir <HI>Bernard
Gascoigne,</HI> and my self, with some of our Retinue, were obliged to
leave the Army upon our Left, to get over several difficult Places. However,
we came at last safe to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> tho' something about, and
were in great Fear, that all our Foot and Cannon were lost; but it seems
Sir <HI>Joseph Wagstaffe</HI> marched all Night, and came safe the next
Morning to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and we lost only one Piece of Cannon that
Way, be∣cause the Carriage of it was broke. I stayed all that Night with
the General in his Chamber, and when I gave him Notice in the Morning, that Sir
<HI>Joseph Wagstaffe</HI> was come with the Foot and the Cannon, he was
overjoyed.</P>
<P>After we had reposed two Days at <HI>Bridg∣water,</HI> and got
together our shattered Troops, who all past thro' <HI>Bridgwater</HI> as
fast as they came, for their greater Security, we then mar∣ched towards
<HI>Dunstar</HI> Castle, which we left on our Right, and made little or no
Stop till we came near <HI>Torrington,</HI> where our Army quarte∣red, and the
General made his Head Quarters at Mr. <HI>Rolles</HI>'s House, where we
stayed some Days, and then we marched towards <HI>Barnsta∣ple,</HI> and
from thence to <HI>Exeter,</HI> where we stayed that Winter, with Four
Thousand Horse, who quartered in the Country near us. Whilst 
<PB N="141" REF="162"/> we were about <HI>Torrington,</HI> the General sent
the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> at
<HI>Launceston,</HI> making great Complaints of his hard Usage, and made
several Demands from the General, to which no Answer was given, because
the Chancellor of the Exchequer was absent, being gone farther into
<HI>Cornwal</HI> upon great Affairs of the Prince; and besides, the Prince
intended, at the Chancellor's Return, to go to <HI>Exeter</HI>; and when the
Prince came thither, General <HI>Goring</HI> was ill, and in a Course of
Physick: Whereupon the Chancellor was sent to him, to whom, after many
Assurances of continuing faithful to the King, and his Interest, he then
freely declared his Apprehen∣sion of his Brother <HI>Porter</HI>'s
Negligence, or Treachery, in many particular Instances, and that he
resolved to be quit of him. The Chan∣cellor then told his Excellency freely,
that his Demands by the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> to the Prince, were not
seasonable for his Royal Highness to grant, nor fit for him to ask; and
so the Chan∣cellor left General <HI>Goring.</HI></P>
<P>But I must not forget to tell, that whilst General
<HI>Goring,</HI> Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> Lieutenant General <HI>Porter,</HI>
and most of the General Offi∣cers, both Horse and Foot, kept their Winter
Quarters in and about <HI>Exeter,</HI> the Death of Sir <HI>John Digby</HI>
made vacant the Employment of a Major General of Horse to the Lord
<HI>Goring</HI>'s Army, for which there were several Pretendants, amongst
which was Collonel <HI>Samuel Tuke,</HI> who being the eldest Collonel of 
<PB N="142" REF="163"/> Horse in our Army, stood fairest for it,
espe∣cially being a Favourite to Lieutenant Gene∣ral <HI>Porter,</HI> and to
Collonel <HI>Charles Goring,</HI> the General's Brother; and therefore made his
first Address to the Lieutenant General, desiring his Assistance in
his Pretentions; which being promised him by the Lieutenant General, he then
applied himself to the Lord General <HI>Goring,</HI> who told him, he would
willingly have served him, but that he was before engaged for Collonel
<HI>Webb,</HI> by the Intercession of Lieute∣nant General <HI>Porter:</HI>
At which Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> being much surprized, he presently demanded
the Lord General's Permission to quit his Com∣mand, declaring, that being
the eldest Collo∣nel in the Army, he thought it a Right belon∣ging to him,
and that he could not serve with Honour, since another was put over his
Head. Hereupon the Lord General forthwith promi∣sed him his Discharge, and
commanded his Se∣cretary, <HI>Dun,</HI> to draw it. Upon this Infor∣mation from
the General himself, that he was ingaged for Collonel <HI>Webb,</HI> upon the
Sollicita∣tion of Lieutenant General <HI>Porter,</HI> Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI>
wrote a very reproachful Letter to the Lieutenant General, which so soon as
he re∣ceived, he forthwith sent his Brother-in-Law, Collonel <HI>Charles
Goring</HI> (for they were then both at Sir <HI>William Portman</HI>'s, five
Miles from <HI>Exeter</HI>) to desire Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> to meet him at a
Place he then appointed, to interpret his Letter; and Collonel <HI>Goring</HI>
also told Collonel <HI>Tuke,</HI> that he must bring a Friend with him, 
<PB N="143" REF="164"/> who thereupon sent to Collonel <HI>Adrian Scroop,</HI>
who promised to go with him the next Mor∣ning. But this Business was not
carried so privately, but that it quickly came to the Lord General's
Knowledge, who presently sent for me, and commanded me to set Guards
imme∣diately upon Collonel <HI>Tuke,</HI> and upon Collo∣nel <HI>Scroop,</HI>
and to require them, in his Excel∣lency's Name, not to stir from their
Lodgings till farther Orders. The Lord General was at this time indisposed
with the Gout, and kept his Bed, but he presently sent for the Lord
<HI>Wentworth,</HI> and desired him to call a Council of War the next
Morning, of the principal Of∣ficers that were then Town, and that his
Lord∣ship would be President of it, for that there was a Quarrel, and a
Duel designed, betwixt Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI> and Collonel
<HI>Tuke:</HI> That this last was already secured in his Lod∣ging, and
also Collonel <HI>Scroop,</HI> who was to be his Second; and that he had
sent for the Lieute∣nant General, and his Brother Collonel <HI>Goring,</HI>
who was concerned in the Quarrel. The next Morning the Council of War met,
where Lieu∣tenant General <HI>Porter</HI> was present, and sat with the
Council, which was composed of the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> as President,
Lieutenant General <HI>Porter,</HI> Major General <HI>Wagstaffe,</HI> Sir
<HI>William Courtney,</HI> Sir <HI>Foulk</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Hunkes,</HI>
Sir <HI>Thomas Basset,</HI> and my self. The first thing (after having
read the Letter) upon Debate was, That the Letter was very reproachful and
provoking: The Substance of the Letter was, <PB N="144" REF="165"/> <HI>That
he</HI> (Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI>) <HI>would no more accuse Lieutenant
General</HI> Porter <HI>of Cowardice, since he had fought, and killed a
Collonel in Justifi∣cation of his Honour; but that the Lieutenant General was
guilty of many other Sins, which ran in the same Rank with Cowardice; as, in
his Breach of Faith, having promised to assist him in his Pretentions
to the General, when he had before ingaged the General to another: In his
little or no Religion, in turning the Bible and all sacred things into
Ridicule: In his great and constant Debaucheries, with many other Vices not
fit to be named; and that now being upon even Terms with him, he could do no
less than reproach him for his treacherous and unjust Dealing, in this
Particular of his Pretentions, from the General's own Mouth; and that he
should look upon him as his darling Sin, whom he had loved the longest, and
had the most Reason to repent him of it.</HI></P>
<P>After reading this Letter, which was much enlarged upon by the
Lieutenant General, who declared, that tho' the Letter was not a formal
Challenge, yet it was so provoking and reproach∣ful, that no Man of Honour
could receive it, without giving a Challenge to him that sent it; and that
this was also from an inferior Officer to a superior, which was Death by
the Articles of War. Hereupon arose a long Debate, after which the Council
ordered, that I should go forthwith to the Lord General, to know from him,
whether he had discharged Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> from being an Officer in his
Army? To which <PB N="145" REF="166"/> the General told me, <HI>That he had
discharged him, and promised him a formal Discharge in Writing, and
commanded his Secretary to draw it up; and that if it was not done, it was the
Fault of his Secretary; and that since he had discharged him by Word of
Mouth, he esteemed him to be no longer an Officer.</HI> Upon my deli∣vering
this Answer from the General, the Coun∣cil left off that Point, of debating
his being an Officer; but the Council thought fit a Wri∣ting should be drawn
up, and presented to him, which he should read publickly in Council, which
was done accordingly in these Words following. <HI>I confess to have
written a scanda∣lous and injurious Letter to Lieutenant General</HI> Porter,
<HI>for which I am heartily sorry, and so desire his Remission and
Friendship.</HI> This Wri∣ting being agreed upon by the Council, Collo∣nel
<HI>Tuke</HI> was called in to make this publick Acknowledgment; which Paper
being given to Collonel <HI>Tuke,</HI> he having first read the Words
privately to himself, he expressed him∣self in publick thus. <HI>I
confess to have written a Letter to Lieutenant General</HI> Porter; <HI>it
was my Sense of him when I wrote it, which is still my Belief, and there is
not a Syllable in it which I will not justify with my Life.</HI> Upon this
the Council commanded him to withdraw, and they began to be very sharp upon
him, that he should make that publick Declaration, contra∣ry to the Sentiment
of the Council; and it was the Opinion of some, that he should be
com∣mitted to Prison, till he should make that pub∣lick 
<PB N="146" REF="167"/> Acknowledgment which the Council had ordered: But Sir
<HI>Foulk</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Hunkes,</HI> with Sir <HI>Thomas
Basset,</HI> declared against it, and said, tho' he had spoken so
publickly his Sense as to his own Letter, yet he had not refused <HI>in
terminis</HI> to make the Acknowledgment; and that therefore, before they came
to that Extre∣mity, of committing him to Prison, one of the Council should
be sent to him, to perswade him to make that publick Acknowledgment; and
accordingly I was desired to go to him, which I did, and told him the Sense
of the Council, and that it was their general Opinion, that he should not
scruple of making that publick Ack∣nowledgment, if he was called in again.
And upon my Return to the Council, and declaring that I found him willing to
make that Acknow∣ledgment, he was called in again; and after his Respects
made to the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> and the Council, he took the Paper in his
Hand, and said, <HI>In Obedience to the Order of your Lordship and this
Council, I do confess to have written a scandalous and injurious Letter to
Lieutenant General</HI> Porter, <HI>for which I am heartily sorry, and do
desire his Remission and Friendship</HI>; and then he retired. But then
the Lieutenant Ge∣neral began to complain heavily, and said That was not a
sufficient Satisfaction for the publick Scandal he had received, nor for the
insolent Behaviour of Collonel <HI>Tuke,</HI> and he seemed nothing
pleased or satisfied with what the Coun∣cil had done, who thereupon broke
up without farther Satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="168"/>Some time after this, Lieutenant General
<HI>Porter</HI> came again to <HI>Exeter,</HI> before it was sur∣rendered,
and sent again to Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> for farther Satisfaction; but the
Collonel being then sick in Bed, was not able to meet him as he desired:
However, Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> did then write a Letter to him, assuring
him, that so soon as he was able to get on Horseback, he would not fail
to find him out, and give him the Satisfaction he desired, if the Fear of our
sudden Ruine did not make him go to the Par∣liament sooner, which fell out
as he foretold: For soon after this, Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI> made
his Peace with General <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and went into the Parliament's
Quarters, and Col∣lonel <HI>Tuke</HI> never heard more of him, nor from
him.</P>
<P>About this time the King sent to General <HI>Goring,</HI> to
march to him with his Army; but the General neither obeyed the King's Orders,
nor communicated them to the Prince, or advi∣sed with the Prince about them,
tho' his Royal Highness then let him know, that he was well content he
should break thro' to the King with his Horse, thinking he might well and
easily have done it: But the General (after Recovery of his Health) spent
his Time in his usual Jol∣lities, and was privately resolved to leave the
Army, and go beyond Sea; and Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI> was also
resolved to quit the Army, and retire to <HI>London</HI>; but both these
Transactions were carried very privately, and known to none but the Lord
<HI>Wentworth,</HI> who <PB N="148" REF="169"/> went to the Prince with a Letter
from Gene∣ral <HI>Goring,</HI> to beg Leave for his going into <HI>France,</HI>
for Recovery of his Health, as he pre∣tended; yet intimating at the same time
to his Royal Highness, that he hoped to do him great Service by his going
thither. But I was after assured by the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> that he
never attended the Prince's Resolution, but went forthwith to
<HI>Dartmouth,</HI> and there embarqued for <HI>France</HI>; but before his
going, sign'd a War∣rant for some Money for Lieutenant General
<HI>Porter,</HI> to bear his Charges to <HI>London,</HI> who soon after the
Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Absence, declined the Exercise of his Command, and
having re∣ceived a Pass from Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> he went forthwith
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s going for <HI>France,</HI>
the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> declared, that General <HI>Goring</HI> intended to
return no more, but relied upon his Lordship to preserve the Horse, till
he could procure Licence from the Parliament to transport them for the
Service of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or some other foreign Prince. But
after General <HI>Goring</HI> left the Army, the Sol∣diers took a greater
Liberty than before, and much resented his going away. From the Be∣ginning of
<HI>July</HI> till towards the End of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> the General stayed
at <HI>Exeter</HI>; and Four Thousand Horse were quartered in that
Neigh∣bourhood, without making any Attempt upon the Enemy: And considering
his doing nothing in all that time but pleasing himself, many were of
Opinion, that if he had been confede∣rate <PB N="149" REF="170"/> with the
Enemy, and been corrupted to betray the West, he could not have done worse;
not having obeyed the King's Commands in going to him, tho' his Royal
Highness was willing to it. His Courage indeed was always esteemed, but
least of all his Conscience and Integrity, and there was much Difference
be∣twixt the Presentness of his Mind in a sudden Attempt, (tho' never
so full of Danger) and of an Enterprize which required Deliberation and
Patience, for he could not keep his Mind long bent; of which I had a particular
Experience at his Siege of <HI>Taunton,</HI> where the Governour for the
Parliament made many frequent and dangerous Sallies, but were always
unsuccess∣ful, by the Vivacity and Courage of General <HI>Goring</HI>'s
Spirit, which was very extraordinary.</P>
<P>After this General's going into <HI>France,</HI> his Army was
solely left to the Disposition of the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who was a
very lazy and un∣active Man, and was not thought either of In∣terest,
Experience, Courage, or Reputation enough, for that Trust which was devolved
upon him by General <HI>Goring:</HI> It was therefore resolved by his Royal
Highness, that he should rather be advised than commanded; and that if
his Lordship comported himself with that Tem∣per and Modesty which was
expected from him, all Resolutions should be formed in the Prince's
Council, and all Orders should issue in his Lordship's Name, for the
Relief of <HI>Exeter</HI>; for all the Army of Horse was then drawn off from
<HI>Exeter,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> <PB N="150" REF="171"/> was
quartered at <HI>Ashburton,</HI> six Miles from <HI>Totnes,</HI> and the
whole Contribution which was for Support of the Army, was taken forcibly by the
Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Horse. Whereupon the Prince, being then at
<HI>Totnes,</HI> sent for the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who told the Prince in
the first Place, that he was to declare to his Roy∣al Highness, that he
could receive no Orders from any Person but his Highness, the Lord
<HI>Goring</HI> having reposed that Trust in him, and talked very
imperiously and disrespectfully. However, the Prince took little Notice
of it; but the next Day his Lordship being in Drink, which was his usual
Fault, he talked very offensively to the Chancellor (whom he always hated)
tho' of the Prince's Council, in Presence of the Prince, who being much
dissatisfied with the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Carriage, told him, he
would take the Command of the Army upon himself, and issue out the Orders
as he should think fit; upon which the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> troubled, and
much unsatisfied, returned to his Quarters at <HI>Ashburton,</HI> which
were soon after beaten up by the Enemy at Noon Day, and the Army thereby put
into great Disorder.</P>
<P>Upon this Incident the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> went in great
Haste to the Prince, who was then at <HI>Tavestock,</HI> upon the Borders
of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and in∣formed the Particulars of his Loss, which was not
so great as his Lordship imagined. The Prince was very desirous to
pursue his former Resolution of going to <HI>Totnes</HI> with the Body of
his Army; but the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> told him, he believed 
<PB N="151" REF="172"/> the Enemy was possessed of <HI>Totnes,</HI> and
that he could not so soon recover his Loss, nor get his Troops together
in any considerable Number, till they had some Days Rest; and so that
De∣sign of the Prince was ended; whereas the Rout of the Army was
occasioned only by small Parties of the Enemy, who came into our Quarters
in the Daytime, and found no Guards, and all their Horses in the Stables.
Here∣upon his Royal Highness thought fit to go to <HI>Launceston,</HI> upon
the Borders of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> to be farther from the Enemy, and commanded
the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> that all his Horse should be quartered on
<HI>Devonshire</HI> Side, fearing otherwise, that all the Trained Bands of
<HI>Cornwal</HI> would run Home to save their Houses from being plun∣dered,
to which the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Troops were much addicted, who
dispersed themselves for many Miles about the Country, as if no Enemy was
near them, and were all comman∣ded by Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who challenged
them by Deputation from the Lord General <HI>Goring</HI>; and the Lord
<HI>Wentworth</HI> would submit to no other Command but that of the Prince.
The Mischief which grew hereupon was much more visible than the Remedy,
when both Officers and Soldiers (by the Looseness and Extrava∣gancy of the
Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Government) were glad to take any Occasion of
Excuse for laying down their Arms: And whoever was fit would hardly undertake
the Command of a dissolute, undisciplined, wicked, beaten Army, upon
which he must engage his Honour. Howe∣ver, <PB N="152" REF="173"/> some
Resolution was absolutely necessary in that Conjuncture to be taken by
the Prince, who thereupon declared the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> should take upon
him the Care of the whole Army, as being General, and the Lord
<HI>Wentworth</HI> should be General of the Horse, and Collonel
<HI>Webb</HI> Major General, and Sir <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> General of the
Foot.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> being entirely devoted to the King's
Interest, submitted to the Pleasure of the Prince, and told his Royal
Highness he would obey him, tho' he knew he must lose his Honour: But
since his Royal Highness thought it necessary to command him, he was
most ready and willing to obey. There was no Suspicion of Sir <HI>Richard
Greenvil,</HI> because he had been before under the Command of the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI>; but it was believed the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> (who had
carried himself more high and imperiously since his disorderly Retreat
from <HI>Ashburton,</HI> than before) would have refu∣sed; in which Case
the Prince resolved to com∣mit the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> and would have
given his Command to the Lord <HI>Capel:</HI> But much contrary to Expectation,
Sir <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> refused, who was thereupon forthwith sent
Pri∣soner to the <HI>Mount</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> where he was, till the
Enemy possessed the greatest Part of that County; and then, that he
might not fall in∣to the Hands of the Enemy, the Prince permit∣ted his being
transported beyond Sea. And tho' the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> seemed much
surpri∣zed with the Prince's Order, which he heard 
<PB N="153" REF="174" MS="y"/> read at the Council Table, desired time to
con∣sider of it till the next Day, that he might confer with his Officers;
yet the Prince told him sharply, that he would not refer his Acts to be
scanned by his Officers, but that his Lord∣ship should presently give
his positive Answer, whether he would submit, or not? To which he
submitted, and went that Night to his Quar∣ters; at which neither the Prince,
nor his Council, nor others, were very glad, but rather wished he would have
obliged the Prince to make other Alterations, as the Prince intended, because
he knew the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Hu∣mour, that he would never chearfully
obey.</P>
<P>The Prince then hearing of the Loss of <HI>Dart∣mouth,</HI> and
every Day was News, and fearing the Loss of <HI>Exeter,</HI> it was thought
fit the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> should march back with his Army to∣wards
<HI>Torrington,</HI> and that the Prince should not hazard his Person any
longer in that open Country, but should retire to <HI>Truro,</HI> near the
nether End of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> for his greater Security.</P>
<P><HI>Fairfax</HI> having taken <HI>Dartmouth</HI> by Storm, the
Governour soon surrendered the Castle. He then came to <HI>Exeter,</HI>
which he summoned, but having received a stout Answer from Sir <HI>John
Berkeley</HI> the Governour, he left Sir <HI>Hardress Waller</HI> to finish
that Work, and went with his Army after the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who had fixed
himself near <HI>Torrington,</HI> and had not been there above four or five
Days, where he had made some Barricadoes and little Fastnesses, but he
heard that General <HI>Fairfax</HI> was come within <PB N="154" REF="175"/>
eight Miles of him. However, the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> for good Reasons,
thought it better to expect the Enemy there, than to retire into
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> with the few that remained of the Trained Bands, who would
immediately dissolve, and run to their Houses, and all would soon be
de∣stroyed without Fighting; and therefore his Lordship chose rather
staying where he was, notwithstanding the great Disadvantage in Number,
thinking he might there defend him∣self with greater Advantage, than in any
other Place. Very sharp Disputes were on both Sides, and the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI>'s Foot behaved themselves with such Courage, that they
maintained the Fight all that Day till Night, retiring still to∣wards
<HI>Torrington</HI>; but at last, being over∣powered by the Numbers of the
Enemy, who were supplied from time to time with fresh Troops, they forced
the Barricades, the Horse with his Lordship neither charging nor making a
Stand, but basely ran away in great Con∣fusion, leaving their General, the
Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who was hurt in the Face with a Pike, and his Horse
killed under him; but receiving a fresh Horse, he was obliged to retire to
<HI>Strat∣ton,</HI> where he stayed some Days, till Twelve Hundred of his
Foot came up to him. Upon his Lordship's retiring, the Enemy entered
<HI>Torrington,</HI> and fell to Pillaging and Plun∣dering the whole Town
extreamly, but were soon stopt, by the Ammunition in the Church taking
Fire, by what Accident was unknown, but it brought a dismal Destruction
both upon <PB N="155" REF="176"/> the Soldiers and Burghers, there being near an
Hundred Barrels of Powder in the Church, which made a terrible <HI>Fracas</HI>
amongst all People; which being finished, and General <HI>Fairfax</HI>
having a little settled <HI>Torrington,</HI> he marched after the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> to <HI>Strat∣ton,</HI> whereupon his Lordship retired farther
to <HI>Bodmin,</HI> and those Horse commanded by the Lord
<HI>Wentworth</HI> observed no Orders. The Prince went from <HI>Truro</HI> to
<HI>Pendennis</HI> Castle, and the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> and the Lord
<HI>Capel</HI> advertized his Royal Highness, that they had severally
received Intelligence of a Design to seize upon the Person of the Prince,
who there∣upon returned no more to <HI>Truro,</HI> but stayed at
<HI>Pendennis</HI> Castle, and no Person knew the King's Pleasure
concerning the Prince, but the Lord <HI>Culpepper</HI> and the Chancellor of
the Ex∣chequer; and they two knowing only what was to be done, had no great
Confidence that they should have Reputation enough to go thro' with it,
finding the Earl of <HI>Berkshire,</HI> who was then Governour to the Prince,
jealous of the Design of going into <HI>France,</HI> whatever they said to
the contrary, and the Governour of <HI>Pendennis</HI> Ca∣stle being old and
fearful, they durst not trust him with the Secret: Whereupon they sent
Letters forthwith to the Lords <HI>Hopton</HI> and <HI>Capel,</HI> to know
their Opinion, who both agreed, that the Prince was immediately, without Loss
of Time, to be transported to <HI>Scilly,</HI> which was a Part of
<HI>Cornwal</HI>; and News being daily brought, that our Army was still
retiring, and <PB N="156" REF="177"/> General <HI>Fairfax</HI> advancing after
it, Resolution was therefore taken, that the Prince should that Night
embark for <HI>Scilly,</HI> a Ship being ready for him then in the Harbour; and
the Gover∣nour and his Son (who was a worthy honest Gentleman) were called in
to the Prince's Chamber, and made acquainted with it; and that Night the Prince
went on Board, and ar∣rived the next Night safe in <HI>Scilly</HI>; from
whence the Lord <HI>Culpepper</HI> was immediately dispatched to
<HI>France,</HI> to acquaint the Queen with the Ar∣rival of the Prince in that
Island, and with the Wants and Incommodities of it, and that it was not so
strong as reported; and therefore his Royal Highness was soon embarked
from thence for <HI>France,</HI> where they all safely ar∣rived.</P>
<P>When the Prince was gone, and the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> left
General in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> he soon found the Soldiers, especially the
Horse, could not be restrained from Plundering, and thereupon his
Excellency called a Council of War, to con∣sider what was to be done. The
Lord <HI>Went∣worth,</HI> with the principal Officers, declared, that the Men
would never be brought to fight, being taken in a worse Trap, than they took
<HI>Essex</HI>'s Army near <HI>Foy,</HI> and the Horse Officers
proposed to send for a Treaty, to which they all agreed, except Major
General <HI>Webb.</HI> The Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> told them, he could not
consent to a Treaty, without Leave from the Prince. But whilst the Officers
continued their Impor∣tunity, a Trumpeter arrived at the same time 
<PB N="157" REF="178"/> from General <HI>Fairfax,</HI> with a Letter to the Lord
<HI>Hopton,</HI> offering a Treaty, which his Lordship kept private: However,
the General Officers all assembled, and declared, if the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> would not consent to a Treaty, they would treat themselves;
and that in the <HI>Interim</HI> they would neither keep Guards, nor do their
Duty, the Enemy's Horse every Day mingling with them, without any Act of
Hosti∣lity, and bought several of our Soldiers Hor∣ses. Then the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> declared, that he would neither treat for himself, nor for
any of the Garrisons, and gave the Horse Leave to treat. Whereupon some
Persons were presently appointed, and Articles were soon concluded, and
the Army of Horse was dissolved; and every Horseman who had not sold
his Horse, had Twenty Shillings, with a Passport from Gene∣ral
<HI>Fairfax,</HI> to go home to their Houses, and there to live quietly,
without engaging farther in the Wars; and many of our Soldiers had sold and
exchanged so many good Horses, for pitiful Jades they received from the
Enemy, that they would not give Twenty Shillings apiece for them; and so many
Hundred of Sol∣diers went Home on Horseback, with their Passes from the
General, that the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was obliged to treat with the Enemy,
tho' he would have no Article for himself, nor be men∣tioned in the Treaty:
After which, his Lord∣ship, with the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> Lord
<HI>Capel,</HI> and Major General <HI>Webb,</HI> went to the <HI>Mount</HI> in
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> from whence they were transpor∣ted <PB N="158" REF="179"/>
to <HI>Scilly,</HI> and from thence were embarqued for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The King being now reduced to the lowest Condition that
possibly could be, having lost all his Forces, most of his Garrisons
taken and yielded, and General <HI>Fairfax</HI> having cleared the West, was
marching to besiege <HI>Oxford.</HI> The King being there, began to think of
some Way for his Escape and Safety; and being treacherously invited by
the <HI>Scots,</HI> to put him∣self under the Protection of their Army then
at the Siege of <HI>Newark,</HI> his Majesty went dis∣guised from
<HI>Oxford,</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1646, accompa∣nied only with Mr. <HI>John
Ashburnham,</HI> a Groom of his Bed-chamber, and Mr. <HI>Hudson</HI> a
Mini∣ster, few or none else being acquainted with his Design; but all
were amazed, when they heard he was arrived in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Camp, he
having been before-hand promised Security for himself, and those he
brought with him, or that should come to him, tho' they denied both in Word
and Act, as plainly appeared by their delivering him to the Parliament, a
Prisoner, for Two Hundred Thousand Pounds <HI>Sterling:</HI> And that the
<HI>Scots</HI> may be the better known, I shall give you their Character by
one who was well acquainted with their wicked Princi∣ples. He tells us,
<HI>They are a People who de∣light to enslave others, yet are of a
slavish Con∣dition themselves; a People, whose Freedom is Service,
whose Mercies are Cruelties, whose Religion is only Formality, whose
Government is Tyranny, a Generation of Vipers and Hypo∣crites,</HI> 
<PB N="159" REF="180"/> <HI>whom no Oaths or Covenants can bind, no Courtesy
or Civility oblige.</HI> Thus the King was delivered Prisoner to the
Parliament by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and by the Parliament sent Prisoner to
<HI>Holmby</HI>; and from thence he was soon after forcibly taken away, and
carried to the Army, by Cornet <HI>Joyce</HI>; who being asked by the
Parliament Commissioners, who then waited upon the King, by what Authority
he did it? He answered, it was by the Pleasure of the Army, and that the
King should be with them with Honour, and in Safety. This Action startled
the Parliament extreamly, who from this time began to surrender themselves
and their Power into the Hands of their own Army. The General, in his Letter to
the Parliament, makes the King's Remove from <HI>Holmby</HI> to be by his own
Consent; tho' certainly it was not so, tho' it might be without the
General's Knowledge: And the Lord <HI>Dumfermling</HI> ac∣quainted the
Parliament, that the King com∣manded him to tell them, that his Majesty was
unwillingly taken away, by a Party from the Army; and that he desired both
Houses to maintain the Laws of the Land, and that he might be obliged to
sign many things in that Condition, and that he would not have them be
believed, till they had farther Notice from his Majesty.</P>
<P>Thus we see the Inconstancy of Men, and the Uncertainty of
worldly Affairs. The Offi∣cers and Soldiers of an Army, tho' never so
successful and well disciplined, will, for want <PB N="160" REF="181"/> of
Action, fall into Discord, and Designs of Trouble: A victorious Army out of
Employ∣ment, is very inclinable to assume Power over their Leaders. When
the Parliament had Con∣quest and Success after their own Desires, yet
they were strangely encumbered with the Mu∣tinery of their Army on the one
Side, and with discontented Petitions on the other, besides the Petulancy
of many Pamphlets, which daily flew abroad against their Proceedings. Many
believed there was some private Treaty at this time by some Officers of the
Army with the King, and that Instructions were given for it by
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> that if the King would assent to their Proposals,
which were much lower than those of the Parliament, the Army would then
settle the King upon his Throne. The King, in his own Judgment, seemed
inclined to it, and therefore disdained the Parliament's Propositi∣ons, and
would rely upon the Proposals of the Army, and urged a Treaty upon them. The
<HI>Scots</HI> complain of the King's being taken from <HI>Holmby</HI> by
Force, and would not apply to the Army, since it ought to be under the
Com∣mand of the Parliament: They declared, that their Stability and Happiness
did much depend upon the Safety and Preservation of the King's Person, and
that they would endeavour to com∣pose the unhappy Differences; and therefore
desire the Propositions may be proceeded upon by the mutual Consent of
both Kingdoms, and desire there might be a present Treaty with the King,
and that he might come to <HI>London</HI> with <PB N="161" REF="182"/> Safety,
Honour, and Freedom. The King being then passionately sensible of the
lan∣guishing and unsettled State of the Kingdom, and of their great
Distractions, pressed earnest∣ly for a Peace, and was most willing to
testify to all the World his Readiness to contribute his utmost
Endeavours for it: But the Parliament then thought the King was too much in the
Army's Interest, who were then contriving their main Design, of coming up
to <HI>London,</HI> to curb both Parliament and City, and to make them act
according to their Prescriptions.</P>
<P>About this time the Agitators were set up, who were some
Soldiers elected out of each Re∣giment of Horse and Foot, to meet and
consult by that Name, who undertook to understand and regulate the chief
Affairs of the Army. These Men were very busy, and the King was privately
informed, whether by Design of the Army, was not known, but supposed by
most to be so, that the Agitators intended some Vio∣lence to the King's
sacred Person; and there∣fore the King was privately perswaded to make an
Escape, if possible, and contrived by Sir <HI>John Berkeley,</HI>
Collonel <HI>Leg,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Ashburnham,</HI> who provided a Ship
at <HI>Southamp∣ton,</HI> and Horses were to be ready at <HI>Hampton</HI>
Ferry, on the other Side, for the King's Escape: And that which gave most
Suspicion that the Army designed the King's Escape, was, that Collonel
<HI>Whaley</HI> (who had the Guard of the King's Person) did that very Day
give the King a Letter, which he said was put into his Hand 
<PB N="162" REF="183"/> by an unknown Person, giving a blind Account of the
Agitators Intention to take away the King's Life for the Good of the Nation;
and that very Night <HI>Cromwell</HI> sent a Letter to in∣form the Parliament
that the King was escaped, the Manner thus.</P>
<P>The Officers who attended the King, won∣dering he came not forth
of his Chamber to Supper, having been long in, writing, they went into his
Chamber, and missed him, with∣in half an Hour after he was gone; and his
Cloak was carelessly cast upon the Ground, in his Way to the Water-side;
and this following Letter was left upon the Table, written with his own Hand,
to be communicated to the Parliament, in these Words following.</P>
<P><HI>That Liberty the King now generally preten∣ded to, and aimed
at, was as necessary for Kings as any other: That he had a long Time
endured Captivity, hoping it might tend to the Settlement of a good Peace; but
finding the contrary, and the Unfixedness of the Army, and new Guards set
upon him, he had withdrawn himself: That wherever he should be, he would
earnestly labour for settling a good Peace, and to prevent the Effusion
of more Blood; and if he might be heard with Freedom Honour, and Safety, he
would instantly break through his Cloud of Re∣tirement, and shew himself
ready to be</HI> Pater Patriae. Upon reading this Letter, and
<HI>Crom∣well</HI>'s Information, it was ordered in Parlia∣ment, That it
should be Loss of Life and Estate for any one to conceal or detain the 
<PB N="163" REF="184"/> King's Person, and not to discover it to both
Houses of Parliament.</P>
<P>Upon the King's Escape the Parliament sent all Ways to find
him; but in the dark, rainy, cloudy Night the King was lost in
<HI>Windsor</HI> Forest, and passing in the Morning thro'
<HI>Farn∣ham</HI> to the Sea-side, his Majesty missed his Design of
going to <HI>Jersey,</HI> the Ship failing to be at the Place, if any Place
was really ap∣pointed which was promised; and the Want of it caused some
Reflections upon the Underta∣ker, who was very well known to me. The King
fearing a Discovery of him could by no Means be prevented, it was resolved,
that the Kjng and Collonel <HI>Leg</HI> should lodge that Night at
<HI>Tedsworth,</HI> at the House of the Countess Dowager of
<HI>Southampton,</HI> which was near the Sea; and that the other two should
ferry over to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> to find Collonel <HI>Ham∣mond,</HI>
under whole Assurance, for his Brother's sake, Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> the
King hoped for some Friendship and Fidelity. This Design was ac∣cordingly
put in Execution; and Sir <HI>John Berkeley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ashburnham</HI>
were both told by the King, that unless Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> gave his
Oath and Faith of Preservation, Protection, Secrecy, and Freedom to the
King's Person at all Times, they should not discover any more, than
signify in general the King's Escape from the imminent Danger of
Assassination: That the King's Desire led him to cast himself
upon Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> for Protection, which if he should refuse,
and secure the Persons of Sir <PB N="164" REF="185"/> <HI>John Berkeley</HI>
and <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> the King and <HI>Leg</HI> (by their not returning at
the Time prefixed) might have Opportunity to dispose of themselves
otherwise. These two being dispatch'd, the King sent <HI>Leg</HI> to
the Countess, to tell her, that a Person of Quality, her dear Friend,
desired the Privacy of her House that Night, without Discovery; to which
she readily consented. On <HI>Sunday</HI> Mor∣ning the two Messengers
got into the Island, and met Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> on his Way towards
<HI>Newport,</HI> whom they acquainted with the Bu∣siness. The Collonel
told them, he wished the King's Safety as his own Soul, that he should not
be inquisitive where the King was, but were he in his Custody, his Oath and
Interest to the Parliament being in Ballance, he should be safe from
Violence; but for the Freedom and Liberty of his Person, he could not
an∣swer it to his Superiours. This Answer tho' not satisfactory, nor
according to their Com∣mission; yet they, being loath to be taken in∣to
Custody, or for what other Reason none can tell, came over with the
Collonel and a Guard to the House of the Countess; and
<HI>Ash∣burnham</HI> went up Stairs to the King's Chamber, and told the King
Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> was be∣low at Supper, and had given Assurance of
Ho∣nour for his Majesty's Safety, but not of Li∣berty for his Person; which
the King hearing, in Passion struck his Hand upon his Breast, and
replied to <HI>Ashburnham; And is this all? Then I am betrayed!
Ashburnham</HI> and <HI>Berkeley,</HI> sorry for their great
Misadvisedness, would have made <PB N="165" REF="186"/> some desperate
Attempt to have killed <HI>Hammond,</HI> which the King would not admit of; and
in this Extremity, with a seeming Willingness, the King went over with them
and with Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> to <HI>Carisbrook</HI> Castle. Collonel
<HI>Ham∣mond</HI> immediately acquaints the Parliament with the King's being
there, who forthwith vote the King should stay there; that none who had
bore Arms against the Parliament should stay in the Island, excepting
such Inhabitants as had compounded; that no Delinquent or Foreigner should
be admitted to the King's Pre∣sence without Leave of Parliament; that those
Persons who attended the King thither should be sent to the Parliament,
which Collonel <HI>Ham∣mond</HI> refused; and also complained, that the
Conditions for the King were not suitable to his Quality. Thus that unhappy
King fell out of one Trap into another; and sends his Message to the
Parliament, why he did not receive their Propositions for Peace, which they
sent him to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> because the Commissioners from
<HI>Scotland</HI> presented him the same Day with a Declaration against
those Propositions, in the Name of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may take notice of the perplexed Condition of the
Parliament; the Army raised, commissioned, and paid by them, making War
against them, and with their Swords in Hand controul their Masters, and had
a Design to carry away the King from the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> but were
prevented by the General; the City, the Parliament's old Friends and
Assistants, <PB N="166" REF="187"/> are averse towards them, and
question their Integrity, reproach them, and would cast them off; the King
writes to the Parliament, and taxes them for not answering his last
Message, and earnestly presses for a present Treaty, that Peace
might be settled, and lays the Retarding it upon them: The <HI>Scotch</HI>
Commissioners declare a joint Interest with the Parliament, for
settling a Peace in both Kingdoms, protest against the four Bills sent
to the King, press for a present Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> saying,
<HI>Let that be given to</HI> God <HI>which is</HI> God<HI>'s, and that to</HI>
Caesar <HI>which is</HI> Caesar<HI>'s,</HI> and put them in Mind of their
professed Loyalty. Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> has more strict Orders to
secure the King, and se∣veral of the King's Servants which attended him are
discharged: Then the Parliament send Commissioners to the King, who
return with∣out Satisfaction; and after a long Debate, the prevailing Party in
the House of Commons vote no more Addresses to the King, and no
Message or Letters to be received from him; and that it should be High
Treason for any to deliver any Message to the King, or receive any from
him, without the Leave of both Houses of Parlia∣ment; and Collonel
<HI>Hammond,</HI> with Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Constable,</HI> had Orders to place
and displace such Persons about the King as they thought fit, which
highly discontented the King; but the Governour said, he had Orders from
the Par∣liament for it, whom he must obey.</P>
<P>Soon after this the General presents an Ad∣dress to the
Parliament, in the Name of the <PB N="167" REF="188"/> whole Army, that they
would stand by the Parliament, in making no more Addresses to the King;
and that they would intirely submit to the Government of the Parliament. Thus
they are quickly made Friends again; and the Army had the Thanks of the
Houses for their Address; who ordered the King's Houshold should be
dissolved, and the Navy no longer be called the King's Navy: Whereupon the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> (as they had Reason) refused to strike Sail, as being
the elder State. Two Earls were named to go to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to acquaint
that Kingdom with what the Parliament had done, and a Declaration was
published for no more Addresses to the King, wherein all the
Miscar∣riages of the Government were named, from the King's first coming to
the Crown.</P>
<P>Thus the Parliament and Army were made Friends, and well fixed
again, by the Cunning of of <HI>Cromwell</HI> and his Party; but then the
Appren∣tices, with others in <HI>London,</HI> made an Insurrection against
the Parliament and Army, and great Pre∣parations were making in
<HI>Scotland</HI> for a War, declaring they would rescue the King from
Im∣prisonment, which was done contrary to the Re∣solution of both Kingdoms;
and that the King might come to one of his own Houses near <HI>London,</HI>
with Honour, Freedom, and Safety: And Infor∣mation came from <HI>Scotland,</HI>
that the King's Party there was very strong, and carried all, and that there
would be a general Rising in that Kingdom, for Religion, King, and Church;
and the Chan∣cellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by Order of their Parlia∣ment, 
<PB N="168" REF="189"/> demanded, that the King might come to some of his
Courts near <HI>London,</HI> with Free∣dom, Honour, and Safety, and that a
personal Treaty be had with his Majesty, and that the Independant
Schismatick Army might be dis∣banded, which governed all as they pleased.
Whereupon the Parliament returned Answer, That they would keep the Covenant
and the Treaty between the two Kingdoms, and that they would be ready to join
with <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Propositions presented to the King at
<HI>New∣market.</HI></P>
<P>About this time, or a little before, the Duke of <HI>York</HI>
made his Escape into <HI>Holland,</HI> and was very tenderly and kindly
received by the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI> at whose Escape
the Parliament was very much troubled; and now Petitions came from several
Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and Risings were in several Counties, and the
People in general were weary of the War, and would have a personal Treaty
with the King: And Risings were not only at Land, but In∣formation came, that
several Ships were revol∣ted from <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> whom they had
set on Shore, and sent for the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> to command them,
who was thereupon declared Admiral. Thus a new War was begun, and great
Divisions and Perplexities were in Parlia∣ment; and yet the Risings in
several Parts for the King not being well concerted, were still quashed,
and did only serve to unite the Party stronger against the King. However,
the Par∣liament seeing that the People's Hearts were <PB N="169" REF="190"/>
generally set against them, and that the revol∣ted Ships at <HI>Deal</HI>
would not own them, finding their Backwardness for a personal Treaty with
the King, and that the City of <HI>London</HI> and Offi∣cers of the Trained
Bands, prayed the King might be brought to <HI>London,</HI> with Freedom,
Honour, and Safety, to treat with the Parlia∣ment, and that the City would
engage for the Security of his Majesty's Royal Person, and would also
undertake to keep the Parliament safe from all Tumults and Mutinery, and that
they would defend the King and Parliament in the Treaty, and defray the Charge
of the Guards during the Treaty, and find a conveni∣ent Place for the Treaty;
with many other Particulars: The Parliament hereupon began to think of a
Treaty, and to set aside their Votes of Non-Addresses. In the mean
time, these several Petitions for Peace encouraged the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> with his Brother, with the Earls of <HI>Holland</HI> and
<HI>Peterborough,</HI> to a Rising about <HI>Kingston,</HI> where they were
soon pursued, and the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> (who had formerly had a
great Hand in bringing Straits upon the King and Kingdom, in the Beginning of
the War) now seeing the Parliament backward to a personal Treaty, hoped
they should be able in the End to bring the Parliament to Reason: But the
Parliament's Army being old Soldiers, prospe∣rous in their Attempts, and well
provided with all Necessaries, it was a desperate Attempt to make Head
against them, without having be∣fore concerted all things well; which was a 
<PB N="170" REF="191"/> great Prejudice to the King's Affairs, there being
small Trust to be given to People's Promises in such Occasions, who
would not stir, unless they saw the Tide turning with some previous
Success, which was at that time very unhappy to the King's Affairs in all
Parts; tho' nothing could be more honourable, just, and pious, than to
endeavour rescuing our Country from the Misery and Slavery it lay under;
and our Sins were certainly the Cause it took Effect, joined with the
Mismanagement of those who undertook it, without having first well
concerted for the carrying on that Design: So that the Earl of
<HI>Holland</HI>'s Party was totally defeated, himself with many others taken
Pri∣soners, and the Brother to the Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham,</HI> and others
killed. Then Duke <HI>Hamil∣ton</HI> enters <HI>England</HI> with an Army, and
all join∣ing with him are declared Rebels. Here is a strange Turn of Affairs,
to which all human Actions are subject. Great Endeavours were formerly
used, to bring in the <HI>Scots</HI> to assist the Parliament, and now
they invade <HI>England</HI> with a considerable Army; they joined before
with the Parliament against the King, and now they took with the King
against the Parliament. The People of this World are like the Sea, still
eb∣bing and flowing, always in an uncertain Mo∣tion, constant in nothing but
Inconstancy.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and Duke of <HI>York</HI> did at this
time come to <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road with divers Ships, and landed some Men,
but were beaten by the Parliament's Horse, and several taken 
<PB N="171" REF="192"/> Prisoners; but the Town rescued them, and the rest
of his Royal Highness's Men got into the Town. The Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
of <HI>Parham</HI> was on Ship-board, and commanded the Prince's Fleet, having
quitted the Parliament, upon their declining a personal Treaty; and when the
Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> came near him with the Parliament Fleet, the Lord
<HI>Willoughby</HI> was ve∣ry earnest to have fought, upon Assurance that
several in the Fleet would have revolted to his Royal Highness; but those
that were about the Prince disswaded him from Fighting, preten∣ding great
Danger to his Highness's Person, and so they carried it: Whereas, in all
Probability, (as the Seamens Affections then stood) the Par∣liament's Fleet
would have been endangered. The Prince then stopped several Merchants
Ships, and sent to the Merchants Adventurers at <HI>London,</HI> for Twenty
Thousand Pounds <HI>Ster∣ling,</HI> to release their Ships; and that he was
come with that Fleet, to endeavour to release his Majesty from his
Imprisonment.</P>
<P>The Parliament seeing the General Inclina∣tion of the People was
for a Treaty, they fell from their Vote of Non-Addresses, and ordered a
personal Treaty with the King in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> with Honour,
Freedom, and Safety, in what Place there his Majesty should appoint, who
well approved of <HI>Newport,</HI> and received the Parliament
Commissioners with much Chear∣fulness, declaring, that no Man desired a
Peace so much as he; and that he would hearken to any Motion that might
conduce to so good an <PB N="172" REF="193"/> End, and that whoever gained by
the Troubles, he was sure to be a Loser; and challenged all Men to produce
the least Colour of Reason, that he was against the Treaty. He then
said, if it was Peace they desired, he had shewed them the Way, by a
just Compliance with all their Interests. If they desired Plenty and
Happi∣ness, they were the inseparable Effects of Peace. If it was Security,
he offered the Militia for all his Time. If it was a Liberty of Consci∣ence,
he that wanted it most, was most willing to give it. If it was the right
Administration of Justice, all Officers and Offices of Trust he left to
the Choice of the Parliament. If they would have frequent Parliaments, he fully
con∣curred therewith. If they demanded the Ar∣rears of the Army which fought
against him, he fully agreed they should be paid: So that all the World
might see his unwearied Endea∣vours for Peace.</P>
<P>The Lords and Commons agreed, that the Vote against farther
Addresses should be recalled: That the King had chosen <HI>Newport</HI>
in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> to treat with the Parliament's
Commis∣sioners, and all such Persons should be admit∣ted, as his
Majesty should think fit to send for: That Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI>'s
Instructions for keep∣ing the King should be repealed, taking the King's
own Engagement for his going abroad in the Island, and Horses, Coaches, and
Mo∣ney, both for the publick, and the King's pri∣vate Use, were sent to the
Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> where the King kept a Fast for a Blessing upon
the <PB N="173" REF="194"/> Treaty, and agreed in every thing, except Re∣ligion,
wherein he let the Commissioners know how far he could condescend. Some
of the Commissioners then begged of the King upon their Knees, with Tears
in their Eyes, as to the Proposition touching Religion, but Matter of
Conscience prevailed more with the King than all their Arguments; of which
they gave an Account to the Parliament, who thereupon vo∣ted, that the King's
Concessions as to Religion, the Church, and <HI>Ireland,</HI> were
unsatisfactory. However, the House of Commons voted, that a Committee
should draw up something for the King's coming to <HI>London,</HI> with
Instructions for the Terms of his Majesty's being in Freedom, Honour, and
Safety: That the Committee should also consider of the King's Desires
concerning his Revenues: That an Act of Obli∣vion should be presented to
the King, to be passed with such Limitations as shall be agreed by both
Houses. The House of Commons vote likewise, that the King should come
to <HI>London,</HI> so soon as the Concessions in the Treaty were
agreed, and that the King should have his Lands and Revenues made good to
him, according to the Laws; and that what he should pass away of his legal
Right, he should have Allowance in Compensation: And that an Act of
Oblivion should be agreed upon. And both Houses agreed to all these
Votes, and, in fine, the Par∣liament voted, that the King's Concessions to
the Propositions of the Parliament upon the Treaty, were sufficient Grounds
for settling the <PB N="174" REF="195"/> Peace of the Kingdom, and they named
a Com∣mittee to go to the General and Head Quarters, to confer with the General
and Officers of the Army, for the Continuance of a good Corre∣spondence
betwixt the Parliament and Army.</P>
<P>But whilst these things were doing, Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI>
sends a Letter to the Parliament, with one inclosed from the General unto
him, requiring him to repair to his Excellency at the Head Quarters, and that
Collonel <HI>Ewre</HI> was appointed to take Charge of the King in the Isle
of <HI>Wight.</HI> Hereupon the Commons voted, That Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI>
should stay in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and continue his Charge, and
that the Admiral should forthwith send Ships for Security of the Isle of
<HI>Wight,</HI> and that they should obey Collonel <HI>Hammond:</HI> But a
Messen∣ger brought Word, that Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> was upon his Way to
<HI>Windsor,</HI> according to the Ge∣neral's Order, and that Collonel
<HI>Ewre</HI> had se∣cured his Majesty's Person, and removed him to
<HI>Hurst</HI> Castle, a pitiful Place, and most pesti∣lential Air.
Hereupon the Parliament sent a Letter to the General, acquainting him, that
those Orders and Instructions from him to Col∣lonel <HI>Ewre,</HI> for
securing the King's Person, were contrary to their Resolution, and
fresh Instructions were sent again by the Parliament to Collonel
<HI>Hammond,</HI> to return, and attend his Charge in the Isle of
<HI>Wight</HI>; and that it was the Pleasure of the Parliament, that his
Excellency should recal his Orders, and that Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI>
should again attend his <PB N="175" REF="196"/> Charge; but Collonel
<HI>Hammond</HI> sent Word to the Parliament, that he was detained at
<HI>Wind∣sor,</HI> and that Collonel <HI>Ewre</HI> had the Charge of the
King. At the same time the General wrote to the Lord Mayor of
<HI>London,</HI> that he was up∣on his March with his Army towards
<HI>London,</HI> and demanded Fourty Thousand Pounds <HI>Ster∣ling</HI>
immediately of the City, and that he would quarter his Army in the void
Houses near the City, as <HI>Whitehall, St. James,</HI> the <HI>Mews, York
House,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon this Advance of the Army, all Persons were full of
Perplexity, not knowing the End of it. The Parliament then declared the
sei∣zing of the King's Royal Person was without their Advice, and against
their Consent; and the House being to sit the next Day, Collonel
<HI>Pride,</HI> with several of his Regiments, stood in the Court of
Requests, upon the Stairs in the Lobby before the House of Commons,
<HI>Pride</HI> having a Paper of Names in his Hand, and the Lord <HI>Gray</HI>
of <HI>Grooby</HI> stood by him, to inform him who the Members were; and
<HI>Pride</HI> seized upon such as the Lord directed by his Note, and
sent them away with Soldiers, by special Order from the General and Council
of Offi∣cers. The House of Commons being informed of this, sent their
Serjeant at Arms to the Mem∣bers seized upon, to let them know, it was the
Pleasure of the House, that they should forth∣with attend the Service of
the House, but they were still detained by the Guard of Officers.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="197"/>The Army having thus ejected the greatest
and best Part of the House of Commons, brought the rest so to their
Will, whom they permitted to sit, that they acted nothing but by their
Di∣ctates, and in pursuance of their Designs, which were to subvert
Monarchy, and to bury it in one Grave with the King; and having contri∣ved with
this Juncto of the House of Commons, how to bring the King to his End, which
they soon resolved upon, with a strange unheard of Impudence, in a
pretended Way of Justice, (whose Death the Juncto had long before
re∣solved upon) and their Design being now ripe, a Resolution was taken,
which amazed the whole Christian World, of which past Ages had ne∣ver any
Precedent, nor may any future Age take Example by this most barbarous and
hor∣rid Cruelty, to bring a just King, their lawful Sovereign (who prized his
Subjects Liberties and Welfare before his own Life) to be ad∣judged by his
most rebellious Subjects, and condemned to die, by a pretended Legality and
Cloak of Justice, with mock Formalities of Law, and Villainy of so deep a
Dye, that all the World blush at, being the Masterpiece of all Iniquities,
which they thought better than to have poisoned their King in
<HI>Carisbrook</HI> Castle.</P>
<P>And when the nauseous pestilential Air of <HI>Hurst</HI>
Castle effected not what they designed, then they carried him with a
strong Guard to <HI>Windsor,</HI> in order to his intended Tryal, deny∣ing
him not only the Ceremony of the Knee, but even the common Civility of the
Hat.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="198"/>The King being brought from
<HI>Windsor</HI> to <HI>St. James,</HI> their Juncto of Parliament proceed to
Votes in order to his Tryal, and declare, That by the fundamental Laws of the
Land, it was Treason in the King of <HI>England,</HI> to le∣vy War against
his Parliament and Kingdom, and all the Blood spilt was by the Juncto laid
upon the King, who was the greatest Sufferer in the War, which was made and
begun upon him; and what the King did, was purely in his own Defence, who
endeavoured to stop that Flux of Blood, by a Treaty with his two Hou∣ses of
Parliament, which was agreed upon, but hindered by the imperious Army, who were
so audacious, as to style the King, in their unpa∣rallelled rebellious
Remonstrance, the King∣dom's capital Enemy, who was formerly con∣demned for
yielding too little to his Parliament, and was now to be condemned by the Army,
for yielding too much: He was formerly im∣prisoned for making War, and now
was to be condemned for making Peace: He was at first condemned for having
evil Counsellours, and was now to be condemned, having no Counsel; and all
this to be done by Wolves in Sheeps Clothing, who pretended only Zeal, when
their Hearts were filled with Blood, and were resolved from Servants to
become Masters, to bring in Democracy, by abolishing Monarchy, declaring in
their Charge, by that impudent Arch-Traitor <HI>Bradshaw,</HI> That the King
of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> is entrusted by the People with a limited Power to
govern according to the Laws of the <PB N="178" REF="199"/> Land, and not
otherwise; and that by his Trust, Oath, and Office, he is obliged to use
the Pow∣er committed to him, for the Good and Bene∣fit of the People, and for
Preservation of their Rights and Liberties; and where the King fails in any
of these, and rules and governs according to his Will, he thereby commits
Treason, and may be impeached as a Traitor and Murderer: A Doctrine never
heard of before, even amongst the most barbarous Nations, it evidently
ap∣pearing, that the Authority of Kings is imme∣diately derived from God, and
not conferred upon them as a Trust from the People. They are called the
<HI>Ministers of God, and the Powers that be are ordained of God.</HI></P>
<P>When God first subjected his own People to the Government of
Kings, the People had no∣thing to do in conferring the Power. <HI>Moses</HI>
was made King and Ruler by God himself; so <HI>Joshua</HI> and the
<HI>Judges</HI>; for so long Theocracy did continue visible amongst Men:
And when the People desired a King, God was not angry with them for
desiring it, for he had before told them, that they should have a King, but
for some Irregularities in the Manner of their de∣siring it; neither was
the King chosen by the People, but by Lot, and no Hand of the Peo∣ple in
chusing him. <HI>David</HI> was made King by God's immediate Choice; but
after him the Government descended by Succession: And no History either
sacred or profane, can shew any Footsteps, that the People did entrust
their Power to their Kings; which Supposition is <PB N="179" REF="200"/> built
upon the mere Strength of their own Ima∣gination. And if we take a View of all
the Ways whereby Princes ascend to the Throne, it will appear they are but
few; and yet in none of them the People confer the Power on the King.</P>
<P>First, by Descent and Succession, as in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
the People do not confer the Power. I know very well, at the King's Coronation,
the Consent of the People is demanded; yet the King is King to all Intents
and Purposes before his Coronation. Besides, all the People are not
summoned, nor any considerable Part of them appear at the Coronation: And
if any should reject his Prince, that would not hinder the Coronation, which
is barely a thing of Course, and does not deduce the King's Power from the
People. Nay, some Kings have de∣ferred their Coronation, being only a
Ceremo∣ny. In the next Place, if a King gets the Crown by Conquest, no Man
can say, he re∣ceives the Crown by Consent of the People, tho' there be a
tacit Consent in their yielding him Obedience. As for those who surprize
a King∣dom by Fraud, they may impose upon the Peo∣ple, so as to gain a
formal Consent, yet there is not a real Consent in those that are thus
cajoled by the People, who had a Hand in bringing them in.</P>
<P>There are some that come to the Crown by Election, and here the
People think the King derives his Power from them, believing the Throne was
vacant, and make Stipulations with him that is to govern: But we must
consider, <PB N="180" REF="201"/> that there is much Difference betwixt
designing the Person, and conferring the Power; the for∣mer is from them
that chuse, the latter by no means. The Dean and Chapter of a Cathedral, by
the King's Leave, chuse a Bishop, <HI>Sede va∣cante</HI>; this Choice
designs the Person, but does not confer the Power, which is afterwards
gi∣ven him in his Consecration. The Aldermen and Commons of a City do yearly
chuse their Mayors; this Choice shews the Person, but does not confer the
Power, which he hath by the King's Charter. When the Electors chuse an
Emperor, or the States of <HI>Poland</HI> chuse their King, they only
design his Person, his Power is not from them, but immediately from God.
But supposing that, in the first Institution of Monarchy, the People
did confer the Power upon the Prince, it doth not therefore follow, that it
lyes in the Power of the People to re∣voke it; tho' this was unlawfully
maintained against King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and since by some People
holding the same Principles, who would have the King's Power to be a Trust
committed to him by the People, and so revocable; which is a very false
Supposition, and the Superstructure upon it must needs fall in Course;
and yet supposing it was true, the Revocableness does not follow.</P>
<P>Both Law and Reason tell us, that what is absolutely conferred
in any Compact, is not to be revoked. When the Aldermen and Common Council have
chosen a Lord Mayor, it does not lye in their Power to reassume the
Trust into their own Hands: When the Knights of the <PB N="181" REF="202"/>
Shire are chosen to sit in Parliament, it does not lye in the Freeholders
Power afterwards to re∣cal their Trust: They might have forbore to commit the
Trust, but they cannot recal it. Then the Accountableness of Princes to
their People, in their Representatives, hath passed for current Doctrine
in the last Age, by Impri∣soning, Trying, and Condemning their lawful King;
whereas no earthly Power can justly call their King in Question, God
Almighty be∣ing the only Ruler of Princes, and to him alone they owe their
Accounts, by whom all Kings reign, and cannot be called to any Account in this
World, but by the Stings of their own Consciences: And it is a plain
Contradiction, after we have owned the King to be Supreme, to affirm there is
any other Superior to him, that can call him to an Account; it being a known
Maxim, <HI>Par in parem not habet Pote∣statem.</HI> If then the King be
Supreme, and there be others in his Kingdom that are Su∣perior to him, then he
is Supreme and not Supreme: But the <HI>English</HI> pretend they are un∣der
Stipulations of a conditional Obedience, provided the King maintains their
Rights; so that the King not performing the former, they are not bound to the
latter: Whereas we are certainly bound to Subjection irrespectively, to a
<HI>Caligula,</HI> as well as to an <HI>Augustus</HI>; to cruel <HI>Nero</HI>
and <HI>Domitian,</HI> as well as to courteous <HI>Vespasian</HI>; to the
Apostate <HI>Julian,</HI> as well as to Christian <HI>Constantine,</HI>
because they have equal∣ly their Power from God.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="203"/>The <HI>Jews</HI> were commanded to pray for
the Prosperity of their Governours, and the Peace of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and
for the Lives of <HI>Nebuchadne∣zar</HI> and <HI>Balthazar</HI>; and this was
performed in the first and purest Ages. They were to pray for their
Emperors and Kings irrespective∣ly to their Religion, or Opinions in it, even
for their Heathen Persecutors: And if they must pray for them, they must
not certainly take up Arms against them: And if we must not touch the
Lord's Anointed, our Assassina∣tion of him is contrary to our not
touching him. <HI>Tertullian</HI> is certainly a competent Wit∣ness for
<HI>Septimius Severus,</HI> and <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI>;
for <HI>Valerianus</HI> and <HI>Gallienus</HI>; the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church
prayed for <HI>Alericus,</HI> the Eastern for the Emperor <HI>Valerius,</HI>
an <HI>Arian,</HI> and for <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Younger, and
<HI>Valentinian</HI> III. the one a <HI>Nestorian,</HI> the other a
dissolute Per∣son; and their Prayers were, that God would grant them long
Life and a secure Reign, and preserve their Families in Safety, and their
Government in Peace; which are perfectly in∣consistent with Attempts on
their Persons, or Practices to disturb the Tranquillity of their
Government. The very endeavouring it, is perfectly opposite to the Tenor of
the Old Testa∣ment, and of the Gospel. King <HI>David</HI> com∣mitted
those two great Sins, of Murder and Adultery, either of which singly was
capital by the <HI>Jewish</HI> Law; and yet we do not find him called to an
Account for them. Nay, in his penitential Confession, he only looks up to 
<PB N="183" REF="204"/> God, and says, <HI>Against thee only have I
sinned:</HI> Which is an Instance by which all Men should be guided.
Besides, for the People to have a Power to call their Prince to an Account,
is highly inconsistent with the Law of Nature, and is against all
Reason and Conscience; for by this the People are both Complainants,
Witnesses, Jury and Judges; a thing never heard of in any judicial
Proceeding: And yet that hellish Juncto of Parliament made a High Court of
Justice (as they called what was the Height of Injustice, and the utmost
Wickedness) to Try and Con∣demn their lawful Sovereign: Such was the
monstrous Impiety of the last Age! when that incomparable Monarch, the
Honour of the World, was forced to bow down his Head, and fall a sad
Sacrifice to the Fury of the most bar∣barous Villains that ever appeared upon
the Stage of this World, when Men threw away a Felicity always to be reflected
on, but never to be recovered, to the World's End.</P>
<P>Thus fell the best of Kings, whose Greatness of Judgment, as
well as that of his Condition, did eminently appear at his Death, in the
Cle∣mency of his Nature, even in pardoning the Trea∣son and Malice of his
most inveterate Enemies, who were not satisfied with his Blood, but
un∣hinged the best of Governments, and brought up∣on the <HI>English</HI>
Nation nothing but Confusion and Misery. And having thus murdered their
King, they took Possession of his Kingdom, disinherited (as much as
in them lay) the lawful Heir, and by their Proclamation declared themselves a
Free <PB N="184" REF="205"/> State. But before I go farther, give me Leave to
give you this King's Character.</P>
<P>He was no great Scholar, his Learning con∣sisted more in what
he had seen, than what he had studied: His Judgment was good, and bet∣ter
than most of his Ministers. The Misfor∣tune was, that he seldom depended
upon it, unless in Matters of his own Religion, where∣in he was always very
stiff. His Arguing was beyond Measure civil and patient. He would seldom
or never contradict any Man angrily, but would always say, by your Favour, I
think otherwise, or, I am not of your Opinion. He would discourage any bold
Address that was made to him, and did not love Strangers; and whilst he was
upon his Throne, he would per∣mit none to enter abruptly with him into
Bu∣siness. He was wiser than most of his Coun∣cil, yet so unhappy as
seldom to follow his own Judgment. He would always (whilst in his Court, be
addressed to by proper Ministers, and still kept up the Dignity of his
Court, limiting all Persons to Places suitable to their Employ∣ments and
Quality, and would there only hear them, unless he called for them in
particular. Besides the Ladies and Women who attended the King, he permitted
no Minister to have his Wife in Court. He spake but slowly, and would
stammer a little, when he began to speak eagerly. He seldom or never made
his own Dispatches, till his latter Days, but would still mend and alter
them; and to that Purpose he would often say, he found it better to be a 
<PB N="185" REF="206"/> Cabler, than a Shoemaker. As to his Religion, he was
very positive in it, and would bear no Arguments against it.</P>
<P>When the Juncto had finished their sad Tra∣gedy, we soon
saw what followed their dismal Actings; for, having got the supreme Power
into their Hands, they were resolved to over∣act all those who should
oppose their tyran∣nical Proceedings: Neither could there be then a greater
Crime than Loyalty, whilst That was only made Treason; and the Servants
having got the Sword into their Hands, they resolved to improve it to their
Security: And having then a Set of Men fit for their Turns, which were the
Juncto, they would be sure that none of those who concluded the late King's
Con∣cessions a sufficient Ground for Settlement of Peace, should sit
amongst them, but should be voted out of the House, and be no more
admitted to sit as Members: And having thus settled their own House,
they, in the next Place, fell upon the House of Lords, and vote, That the
House of Peers in Parliament was useless and dange∣rous, and by an Act of
theirs did abolish it; but yet, that they might have the Privilege to be
elected Knights of the Shire and Burgesses; which was first willingly
embraced by the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> (who would play at small Game
rather than sit out) but the rest of the Lords, sensible of that
strange Alteration of the fun∣damental Government of the Nation, published
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Protestation against it,
in the Name of all the Peers of the Realm, being a treasonable 
<PB N="186" REF="207"/> Proceeding, and tyrannical Usurpation, of some
Members of the House of Commons, being a few insolent and traitorous
Members of that House, while the better and greatest Part of the House
were forcibly detained from thence. But it was in vain to think, by
Protestation, to re∣duce those Men to Reason, who had Swords by their
Sides, and were resolved to overcome, or perish, in Maintainance of their
usurped Au∣thority, and abolishing whatever was right, as most likely to
oppose their Intrusion: And therefore they declared, in the Name of the
Commons of <HI>England</HI> assembled in Parliament (tho' they were not the
tenth Part of their Number) that they found by Experience, the Office of a King
in <HI>England,</HI> and to have the Power thereof in any one single
Person, was unnecessary, and dangerous to the Liberty, Safety, Religion,
and the publick Interest of the Nation, and therefore should be
abolished: And to the End that all Persons might more readily yield
Obedience to their usurped Power, they were absolved from all Oaths made to
their late Sovereign and his Posterity.</P>
<P>Thus this small Part of a seeming Parliament (which was
actually dissolved by the King's Death) acted by the Dictates of the
Council of War, for the Juncto were only the Wheels of the Government, guided
by the Will and Pleasure of the Army; or rather their Tools by which they
acted, who yet thought them∣selves not strong enough, till a third Power
was set up by them, to strengthen them in their <PB N="187" REF="208"/>
Usurpation. This they called a Council of State, consisting of Forty
Persons, most of which were principal Officers of the Army, to whom Power
was given to settle the Militia of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and
to dispose of it from time to time, as they should think fit, and that
they should execute their Powers for a Year; and an Oath was made, whereby
each Member admitted to that Council, was to declare, That he approved what the
House of Commons and their High Court of Justice had done against the
late King, and their abolishing the Kingly Government and House of Lords;
and that the legislative and supreme Power was wholly in the House of
Commons. This Oath Twenty One of the Forty they had named refused to take,
but their Number was soon filled up by them of as large Consciences as
themselves.</P>
<P>About this time, <HI>Cromwell</HI> having been victo∣rious in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and almost conquered all there, left his Son-in-Law,
<HI>Ireton,</HI> Deputy in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to perfect the Conquest of that
Kingdom, and comes over himself to <HI>London,</HI> where he was much
caressed by all the Officers of the new Commonwealth (for so the Juncto
had declared <HI>England</HI> to be) and now the Juncto fearing lest
<HI>Charles</HI> II. should join Interest with the <HI>Scots,</HI> they
provided against a Storm from thence, and ordered a considerable Body of
their Troops to lye upon the Borders near <HI>Scotland</HI>; and having an
Account that the <HI>Scots</HI> had modelled an Ar∣my, with which they were
preparing to enter <HI>England, Cromwell,</HI> with some other General 
<PB N="188" REF="209"/> Officers, were appointed to meet and confer with General
<HI>Fairfax,</HI> and to perswade him, that the <HI>English</HI> Army then
upon the Borders of <HI>Scotland,</HI> might forthwith enter into that Kingdom,
and carry the War into their Country: But the General would not be satisfied
in his Con∣science to do that, being of the same Religion with them,
notwithstanding all the Arguments that <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the other
Officers could use to perswade him. In fine, he told them plain∣ly, he
would rather lay down his Commission than agree with them (which was indeed
the great Design of those Officers that then met) and so they would
press the General no farther, whose Commission was presently accepted
by the Juncto of Parliament, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> was made forthwith General
in <HI>Fairfax</HI>'s Place; and being General, he readily marched with his
Army Northwards, to the great Amazement of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who fearing an
Invasion, al∣ledged the Covenant and the Articles of Paci∣fication, by which
they ought not to be inva∣ded without three Months Warning.</P>
<P>The first News that General <HI>Cromwell</HI> heard from
<HI>Scotland</HI> was, that King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was landed there, and
received as their King; and that it was resolved to invade <HI>England,</HI>
if the <HI>English</HI> Army did not invade them: But that the <HI>Scots</HI>
first thought fit to send to the Juncto of Par∣liament, to know whether the
<HI>English</HI> Marching towards <HI>Scotland</HI> was in a Defensive or
an Of∣fensive Way? Whereupon the Juncto published, in a Declaration, their
Reasons for their Army <PB N="189" REF="210"/> marching Northwards. The
<HI>Scots</HI> forthwith chose a particular Council, by whose Advice and
Direction their King was to govern; who gave such general Satisfaction to the
<HI>Scots,</HI> that by Proclamation published at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Cross,
they gave the King all his Royal Power; where∣upon <HI>Cromwell</HI> advanced,
and sent his Reasons into <HI>Scotland,</HI> of his March with his Army
in∣to that Kingdom, and soon after advanced to <HI>Dunbar,</HI> where both
Armies were near each other; but the <HI>English</HI> beginning to want
Pro∣visions, <HI>Cromwell</HI> resolved to retreat, before his Army was put
to Extremity. But the <HI>Scots</HI> pressed hard upon them, and the
Presbyterian Ministers in the Army encouraged the <HI>Scots</HI> to fight,
contrary to the Opinion of their Gene∣ral, and other principal Officers, who
advised rather to make a Bridge for the <HI>English</HI> Army to pass
quietly homewards, than to hinder or oppose them. But the Ministers carried
for Fighting; and the Day before the Engagement, the <HI>Scots</HI> seemed
so sure of Victory (by Encou∣ragement from their Ministers, who said it
was the Lord's Battle) that they consulted of sen∣ding Propositions to
the <HI>English,</HI> that they should have Leave to pass into
<HI>England</HI> with their Swords only, leaving their Cannon and Ammunition
behind them. 'Tis true, the <HI>English</HI> were then in a very sad
Condition, many sick and wanting Provisions, the Passes before them
stopt, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army on one Side of them, the Sea on the other, and
the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> behind them. The General seeing no Way to 
<PB N="190" REF="211"/> escape, without making his Way thro' them, resolved
to fight, in that desperate Condition, and after one Hour's warm Dispute,
the <HI>Scots</HI> were defeated, and the <HI>English</HI> obtained an
en∣tire Victory, whereby the Scene was so much changed, that the
<HI>English</HI> were forced to break the Pikes and Muskets they took, not
having Conveniency of sending them for <HI>England.</HI> It seems the
<HI>Scots</HI> pursued the <HI>English</HI> to <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and
pressed so hard upon them (thinking they had them in a Net) that the
<HI>English</HI> could not retire without fighting; by which they got so
compleat a Victory, that General <HI>Cromwell</HI> was Master, that very Day,
both of <HI>Leith</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The News of this Defeat being brought to the King, he was
pleased to say, he thanked God he was so rid of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that
their Kirk might then see their Error in prohibiting their King from being in
Person with their Army, and keeping out the <HI>English,</HI> and the
rest of the King's Followers, who, in all Probability, had prevented their
great Misfortune. However, their King was crowned soon after at
<HI>Scone,</HI> tho' the <HI>Scotch</HI> Ministers preached, that their
Defeat was occasioned by their too much Com∣pliance with their King, to whom
most of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords adhered: But some Commanders with the
Kirk were of a contrary Opinion, and would by all means purge the King's
Houshold. However, the <HI>Scots</HI> raise a new Army, whom the King in
Person would command; the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> is made Lieutenant
General, <HI>David</HI> <PB N="191" REF="212"/> <HI>Lesley</HI> Major General,
<HI>Middleton</HI> Lieutenant General of the Horse, and <HI>Massy</HI>
Major Gene∣ral of the <HI>English</HI>; and with this Army the King hoped to
get bye the <HI>English,</HI> and to make the Seat of the War in
<HI>England.</HI> But after a long and terrible March, wherein were several
Engagements, with different Success, the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> being in the
Rear, and on all Sides of the <HI>Scots</HI>; so that most of the
Engagements were to the King's Disadvantage, who at last arrived at
<HI>Worcester</HI> with his shattered Army, where he was beaten by General
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> the Third Day of <HI>September,</HI> as he had done the Year
be∣fore at <HI>Dunbar.</HI> After this total Defeat, the King escaped, and
was miraculously preserved for a better Fortune, and to see the Murderers
of his late Royal Father, at least some of the principal of them, most
justly and deservedly punished.</P>
<P>After the Success of this Battle, General <HI>Cromwell</HI> went
to <HI>London,</HI> and was highly ca∣ressed by all, and having then a
Vacation from military Labours, he had Time to juggle with his Officers, to
advance his Power; for tho' he then governed as King, and the Juncto of
Parliament acted only according to his Dictates, yet he seemed not so great
as he desired, whilst he only acted as Master, under the Title of a
Servant; and finding the Juncto did not proceed in all things according to his
Mind, he resol∣ved to take the Power wholly into his own Hands, that it might
clearly appear what he was in effect: And to this Purpose he got the 
<PB N="192" REF="213"/> Consent of most of the Officers of the Army, who
were his Creatures, to be willing he should break the Juncto of Parliament.
But before he would execute any Part of this, which with∣in himself he had
long before designed, and now being ripe for Execution, he held a long
Conference with an eminent Person, upon whose Opinion and Judgment he much
relied, and declared to him his Dissatisfaction with the Parliament's
Proceedings, and that he would do nothing therein without his Advice, who was
at this time a Member of Parliament, and in great Esteem among them. This
Gentle∣man with whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> then conferred, told him freely, that
since he governed all at pre∣sent, and that the Juncto of Parliament did
nothing without his Consent, he thought it best that he should continue
General as he was, ha∣ving the whole Government in his Hands, un∣less he
would take upon him the Title of King, and then he might govern safely, and
those that served under him would be in no Danger, he being King <HI>de
facto,</HI> according to an Act of Parliament made in the Eleventh of
<HI>Henry</HI> VII. which was still in Force: But <HI>Cromwell</HI>
abso∣lutely refused this, because he knew he could never get the Officers
of the Army their Con∣sent to it, nor some of his own near Relations, who
swore they would kill him, if ever he took that Title upon him. This
Conference puts me in Mind of what Mr. <HI>Hambden</HI> said to the Lord
<HI>Digby,</HI> in the Beginning of the War, as they were going down the
Parliament Stairs. <PB N="193" REF="214"/> <HI>Cromwell</HI> going just before
them, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> (who was then a great Man in the House of
Commons) asked <HI>Hambden,</HI> who that Man was? <HI>for I see,</HI>
saith the Lord <HI>Digby, he is of our Side, by his speaking so warmly
this Day:</HI> Upon which Mr. <HI>Hambden</HI> replied, <HI>That sloven∣ly
Fellow, which you see before us, who hath no Ornament in his Speech: I say,
that Sloven, if we should ever come to have a Breach with the King, (which
God forbid) I say, that Slo∣ven, in such Case, will be one of the
greatest Men of</HI> England; which was a prophetical Speech: But
<HI>Hambden</HI> knew him well, and was intimately acquainted with him.</P>
<P>Now, after this Conference between <HI>Cromwell</HI> and that
other Person, a Member of Parlia∣ment, finding <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s
Averseness to what he proposed, he told him, there was but one other Way
that he knew, whereby <HI>Cromwell</HI> might make himself and Family as
great as he pleased, but that he would not propose it, without first
having an Assurance from his Excellency, that he would not take it ill what
he should say, nor mention it to any other; both which <HI>Crom∣well</HI>
promised him upon his Faith and Honour: And when the Gentleman disclosed
himself farther to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> advertizing him what he might do, to
his own eternal Honour, and to what Advantage he pleased, for all his Family,
his Excellency told the Gentleman, that it was a Matter of the greatest
Importance, and would require a good Time to consider of it. But his
Excellency never spoke one Word more to that <PB N="194" REF="215"/> Gentleman
about it; and finding by that Gentle∣man's Discourse, that he was not like
to approve of what he intended, his Excellency soon found a Way to have him
sent a foreign Ambassador, whilst he continued his first
Resolution; in or∣der to which, he first erects a Council of Offi∣cers, who
expostulate with the Parliament about their Arrears, and the Dissolution
of the Par∣liament, which occasioned a long Debate in the House, where it
was resolved they would con∣tinue their Power: Whereupon General
<HI>Crom∣well,</HI> in the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1653, comes into the House
with some of his Generals, and a File of Musqueteers, and dissolves the
Juncto of Parliament, and after declares his Reasons for it, to give the
People Satisfaction.</P>
<P>In this he was obeyed, tho' with some Mur∣muring and Reluctancy
of the Members. He then bid his Soldiers take away the Fool's Bau∣ble, their
Mace. The Speaker being unwil∣ling to leave his Chair, was pulled out of it by
Collonel <HI>Harrison,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> sat down in it, and
stayed in the House, till he saw all the Members out, and then he
caused the Doors to be locked up, to the great Content of the Nation, who
then judged a worse Slavery could not befal them, tho' they expected little
Liber∣ty or Freedom from him into whose Hands the Power then fell. This
Action was certainly a much higher Affront than what the House of Commons
took so ill from the late King, that one of their own Members should so
violently turn them all out.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="216"/>Thus this Juncto of Parliament was at this
time treated by those that had set them up, and took their Commissions
and Authority from them; nor could the Army justify any Action they had done,
or one Drop of Blood they had spilt, but by their Authority. The Servants
rose up against their Masters, and dissolved that Power by which they
were created Officers and Soldiers, and then the Army took (what they had long
since designed) all Power into their own Hands; and after the Parliament
had sub∣dued all their Enemies, they were overthrown and ruined by their own
Servants, and those whom they had raised, pulled down their Ma∣sters; an
Example very strange! by which we see how uncertain all worldly Affairs
are, and how apt to fall, when they think them at the highest Point: And
soon after this Dissolution, the General gave his Reasons in Print to
satisfy the Nation why he had dissolved them, in a long Declaration.</P>
<P>By this Dissolution, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was possessed
of the Three Kingdoms, having both the legisla∣tive and military Power in his
Hands; and therefore he thought fit to chuse several Per∣sons to be the
supreme Government, who met at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and called
themselves a Par∣liament, and chose one Mr. <HI>Rouse</HI> for their
Speaker, who had the usual Ceremonies belon∣ging to that Office, and this was
by Nick-name called <HI>Barebone</HI>'s Parliament, because he was a Member
of it, being at that time a Leather-Seller in <HI>Fleetstreet.</HI> But this
Parliament not <PB N="196" REF="217"/> agreeing amongst themselves, (tho'
they were but an Hundred and Forty) after some short Time, they resign
their Power to <HI>Cromwell</HI> who gave it them. Then <HI>Cromwell</HI> is
declared by his Council, or by the Instrument of Govern∣ment, as they called
it, Protector of the Com∣monwealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and proclaimed so in the usual Places as the Kings
formerly were; and in this extraordina∣ry Manner he mounted the Throne of the
Three Kingdoms, without the Name of a King, but with greater Power and
Authority than any King, and received greater Esteem and Respect from all
the Princes of Christendom, than ever had been shewed to any Monarch of the
Three Nations: For tho' they all abhorred him, yet they trembled at his Power,
and courted his Friendship. After he had sufficiently beaten the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> he made a Peace with them, and obliged <HI>Portugal</HI> to
send an Ambassador to make Peace, and prosecuted all those of the
King's Party that were at home, with the utmost Ri∣gour and Cruelty, and
erected a High Court of Justice, for Tryal of such as should rise, or
plot any thing against him, and many were executed upon that Account. He made
his youngest Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ire∣land:</HI> But
<HI>England</HI> proved not so as he ex∣pected; for the most considerable
Men that were in the House of Commons, from the time that he dissolved
them, poisoned the Affections of the People towards the Government, and yet
carried themselves so warily, that they did <PB N="197" REF="218"/> not
disturb the Peace of the Nation. And tho' <HI>Cromwell</HI> was then
possessed of the sove∣reign Power, yet he thought himself not
secure, till he had the Consent of the People in Parlia∣ment; and
therefore, according to his Power in the Instrument of Government, he
summo∣ned a Parliament, which met at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the Third Day
of <HI>September</HI> 1654, the famous Day of his two great Victories at
<HI>Dunbar</HI> and <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> and in this Parliament
<HI>Lenthall</HI> was cho∣sen Speaker. This he thought was the only Way to
have the People entirely submit to him, and he ordered it so, that no
Person who had ever been against the Parliament, during the time of the
Civil War, or the Sons of any such Person, should be chosen.
<HI>Cromwell</HI> came into the House, and allowed the Speaker: The first
Speech that was made amongst them, was to know by what Authority they came
thither? And whether he that had convened them, had a lawful Power to do it?
And tho' the Pro∣tector's Creatures endeavoured to direct them, yet many of the
Members declared against the Power: And one more bold than others said,
<HI>That as God had made him instrumental of cut∣ting down Tyranny in one
Man; so now he could not endure to see the Nation's Liberties shackled by
another, who had no Right to the Govern∣ment, but by the Length of his
Sword.</HI> The Continuance of this warm Debate lasted for some Days, which
much perplexed the Prote∣ctor, who sent for the Parliament to him in the
<HI>Banqueting-House,</HI> and told them in his canting <PB N="198" REF="219"/> Tone, that he was sorry to hear they were fal∣ling into Heats and
Divisions, and declared, that the same Government that made him Pro∣tector,
had made them a Parliament; and that therefore no Man was to sit in that
House, that did not first take an Engagement, which he had caused to be
made, which many refused to take, as being against their Privileges, and a
Guard was set at the Door of the House, that none should enter that had
not taken it; and not∣withstanding many refused entering upon that Account,
yet the Residue proved so resty, that he was obliged to dissolve
them; which he did, and said, he could do his Business without them. It
was about this time, that <HI>Wildman</HI> and <HI>Lil∣burn,</HI> the two great
Levellers, were taken and prosecuted, but <HI>Lilburn</HI> more severely
than the other; and tho' he was accused and tryed for High-Treason, yet the
Jury found him Not Guilty. He told the People at his Tryal, <HI>That all</HI>
Englishmen <HI>were obliged to oppose</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s Tyranny, as he
had done purely for their sakes, to preserve them from being Slaves:</HI>
And tho' he was acquitted, yet <HI>Cromwell</HI> never suffered him to be
set at Liberty, but still kept him inclosed from Prison to Prison,
till he him∣self died.</P>
<P>After the Dissolution of the Parliament, <HI>Cromwell</HI> not
thinking himself secure in the Government, he invented a new Chimera to
keep the People in Awe, which was the Go∣vernment by the Major Generals, and
the whole Kingdom was divided amongst them, being <PB N="199" REF="220"/>
Eleven in all: These were principally employed to decimate Delinquents
Estates, and gave them great Power to value what the Tenth Part of every
such Estate did amount to, and every Man was to pay what they thought fit,
and upon Neglect, the Person to be imprisoned, and his whole Estate
sequestered. But finding these Major Generals were very odious to all
Parties, and fearing they might in the End undermine his own Greatness, and
govern like <HI>Turkish</HI> Bassaws, he soon put an End to their
Power, believing they eclipsed his Glory.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Jews</HI> offered <HI>Cromwell</HI> a great Sum of
Money, that they might be permitted to traffick freely; but the City and
principal Merchants therein being much against it, that Project failed him.
After, in the Year 1656, <HI>Cromwell</HI> (who was then called Protector of
the Commonwealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> &amp;c.)
summoned another Parliament, who met accordingly, and remembring the Speeches
and Carriages of many Members of the late Parliament, he gave secret Advice
to the Sheriffs of the several Counties, to hinder, if possible, their
being chosen; but this Advice proved fruitless in most Places. However,
the Parliament met, and before they were permit∣ted to enter the House, they
were to subscribe a Recognition, that they would act nothing that was
prejudicial to the Government, as established by a Protector: Whereupon
many Members chose rather to return home; but the Major Part signed the
Recognition, entered the <PB N="200" REF="221"/> House, and chose Sir
<HI>Thomas Withrington</HI> Spea∣ker, who acted suitably to the Protector's
De∣sires in every thing. The Parliament pressed <HI>Cromwell</HI>
mightily to be King, which <HI>Cromwell</HI> positively refused; but his
Refusal seemed not in the least disadvantageous; for that by a new
Instrument, which was called the Humble Peti∣tion and Advice, they granted
him not only the Authority of Protector for his Life, but also a Power to
declare his Successor; and when they had agreed upon this, they desired
an Audience, which he gave them in the <HI>Banqueting-House,</HI> the Twenty
Fifth of <HI>May</HI> 1657, where their Speaker, <HI>Withrington,</HI>
presented and read the Petition and Advice of his Parliament, and desired
his Assent to it, which the Protector then signed, and made a long
Harangue to them, and was solemnly in∣augurated in
<HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> and adjourned the Parliament till
<HI>January</HI> following.</P>
<P>And thus the Parliament having done all that could be expected
from them, he would do something for himself, whose Greatness, in that
Vacancy, was so well established, both at Home and Abroad, that it
seemed as if it could never be shaken. He was confirmed in his Power with
the Title of Protector, and took his Oath accordingly, and was proclaimed
Protector in the usual Places as the Kings for∣merly were, and solemnly
inaugurated in <HI>West∣minster-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>January</HI> the Parliament met; but new Institutions in
Government are often unsecure, for a Gap was left open, which none of the 
<PB N="201" REF="222"/> Contrivers of the new Government thought of, there being
one Article in <HI>The Humble Pe∣tition and Advice,</HI> to which
<HI>Cromwell</HI> had assen∣ted and sworn, <HI>That no Member lawfully
chosen should be excluded, but by the Consent of that House of which he
was a Member</HI>; and pro∣ceeding to the calling over their House, all
those who had been before refused Entrance, for not signing the
Recognition, were admitted, where∣by above One Hundred of the most inveterate
Enemies of the Protector came and sat in the House: But <HI>Cromwell</HI>
thought he had sufficient∣ly provided for his Security, to restrain the
Insolency of the House of Commons, by having called the other House,
which by the Petition and Advice was to be done, and filled it for the most
Part with Officers of the Army, and of his surest Friends, and that were
firmly fixed to the Protector's Interest.</P>
<P>When the Adjournment ended, and the Houses met,
<HI>Cromwell</HI> came to the Upper House, and sent the Black Rod for the
House of Commons to attend him; and being in his Chair of State, he began his
Speech in the old Style, <HI>My Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses of the House of Commons.</HI> So soon as the Com∣mons
returned to their House, they began to question the Authority and
Jurisdiction of the other House: That tho' the Petition and Advice admitted
there should be another House, but that it should be a House of Peers,
and they be called My Lords, there was no such Provision; nor did it appear
what Jurisdiction they should <PB N="202" REF="223"/> have; and that it
would be ridiculous for them, who sat only by their Vote, no better Men than
themselves, to have a negative Voice to controul their Masters; and they
esteemed it as a thing made on Purpose to mock them: And then they began to
question the Protector's Au∣thority, how his Highness came to place them in
the House of Peers, at which the Commons were much disgusted: Of which
the Protector being advertized, he was strangely surprized, and found he
had been short-sighted, in not having proceeded at the same time, to fill
up his House of Commons, when he erected his other of Peers. However, he
forthwith con∣vened both Houses, and reprehended the House of Commons for
presuming to question his Au∣thority: The other House, he said, were
Lords, and should be Lords, and commanded them to enter upon such
Business as might be for the Benefit, not Destruction of the
Commonwealth, which he would by God's Help prevent: But finding his
Animadversions did not reform them, but that they continued their former
Presum∣ption, and knowing the Ticklishness of his Time would not endure
Disputes, especially as to his Pageant Lords, whom he had newly erected: He
therefore sent the Black Rod for the House of Commons, the Fourth of
<HI>February,</HI> and after having used many sharp Expressions of
Indig∣nation, he told them, it concerned his Interest as much as the Peace of
the Nation, to dissolve them, and accordingly he did dissolve them: And
to shew how little he feared those Men <PB N="203" REF="224"/> who
contradicted him at home, he sent imme∣diately for <HI>Lambert,</HI> and took
away his Com∣mission, and removed him from the Army, who forthwith retired,
and was as little taken notice of, as if he had never been in Authority; which
gave great Reputation to the Protector, and shewed he was Master of his
Army.</P>
<P>Whilst these warm Debates were in Agita∣tion at home, about
the Protector's Govern∣ment, he was so cunning as to make Treaties and
Leagues abroad, and was publickly owned by many Kingdoms and States; and it was
about this time, that the <HI>English,</HI> with Conjun∣ction of the
<HI>French,</HI> took <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Graveling</HI>; the first of
which was by by Agreement garri∣soned by the <HI>English,</HI> and Sir
<HI>William Lockhart,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> made Governour; and
<HI>Graveling</HI> was garrisoned by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>But during these Successes abroad, the King was first at
<HI>Cologne,</HI> where he was well received and treated, before which, his
Family was in great Disorder at <HI>Paris</HI>; but being at
<HI>Cologne,</HI> it was put under the Care and Management of Sir <HI>Stephen
Fox,</HI> who had the Disposal of all, and he there kept the King's House
and Family for about Six Hundred Pistoles a Month; but his Majesty never
kept a Coach all the time he was at <HI>Cologne.</HI> From thence his Majesty
went to <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he stayed in the Year
1657; and after he had been there some time, Six Thousand Guilders was
settled month∣ly for himself and Family; and Half that Sum (I mean Half as
much more) for Support of <PB N="204" REF="225"/> the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and
<HI>Gloucester.</HI> He was then to raise Four Regiments of Foot; the
first Regiment for his own Guards, commanded by the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>;
but they were to do their Duty in the Army as common Men, till his Majesty
was in Condition to bring them about his Person. The Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI>
had the se∣cond Regiment, the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> the third, and the
fourth was given to the Earl of <HI>New∣burgh,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Nobleman,
who had served the King with great Fidelity: And these four Re∣giments were
soon raised. Whilst the King was at <HI>Bruges, Cromwell</HI> exercised
all imaginary Tyranny in his Government: The King's Heart was almost broken
with the daily Informations he received, of the Ruine and Destruction his
loyal Party underwent, and the Butchery acted upon them, and the extreme
Tyranny <HI>Cromwell</HI> exercised over the whole Nation, was then very
grievous to his Majesty, seeing no End of it.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> was then governed by a Rod of Iron, subdued by
those whom they had first taught to rebel, and with whom they had joined to
destroy their own natural Prince, and dissol∣ved that Monarchy which had
been ever since they were a Nation; and those who had used to practise
such ill Behaviour towards their King, were then contemned, and made Slaves
to the meanest of the People, who prescribed them new Laws to which they
had never been accu∣stomed. The King then saw those, who were the
Beginners and first Authors of our publick <PB N="205" REF="226"/> Calamities,
so much Sharers therein, that they were no more Masters of their own.
Estates, than they were whom they had first spoiled; and that no Part of
the new Government was in their Hands who had pulled down the old; and that
after Monarchy had seemed so odious to them, their whole Nation was at the
Disposal of a single Person; and that those <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords,
without whose traitorous Assistance the Scepter could never have been
wrested out of the Hands of their King, were now reckoned amongst the
Dreggs of the People, and so numbred. This could not but give some
Satisfaction to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to see God's Judgments fallen upon
them, who were the principal Cause of our Rebellion in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But before I go farther, I will beg Leave here to give you
<HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Character, both before and after he came to be Protector.
At the first Beginning of the Long Parliament, when he heard any Man speak
of the Troubles of the Nation, he would weep most bitterly, and appear the
most afflicted Person in the World, with the Sense of the Calamities that
were likely to arrive: But the wiser sort of Men in the House of Commons
soon discovered his wicked Intentions, and his great Hypocrisy was no
longer concealed from them. Nothing more perplexed him, than the Death of his
dear Daughter <HI>Claypole,</HI> who was troubled at nothing so much, before
her Death, as at the Blood her Father had spilt; and it was believed she
had represented his worst Actions to him, <PB N="206" REF="227"/> and yet he
never made the least Shew of any Remorse or Repentance for any of his
Actions. He could never have done half that Mischief he did, without having
great Parts of Industry, Courage, and Judgment. He must have had a
wonderful Insight into the Affections and Hu∣mours of Men, who from a private
Birth, with∣out any Interest, Estate, or Alliance, could raise himself
to so great a Height: He attempted that which no good Man durst undertake,
and performed that which none but a wicked vali∣ant Man could succeed in.
There was certain∣ly never a more wicked Man, nor one that ever brought to
pass what he designed more wicked∣ly. He consulted very few, and when he
had once taken a Resolution, he would not be dis∣swaded from it. He was
never unfortunate in any of his Undertakings abroad, but only in that of
<HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Venables,</HI> who were sent out by him with a Fleet and
Land Army, in 1655, and had ill Success. In fine, to reduce Three Nations,
who perfectly hated him, into an in∣tire Obedience, and to govern them with a
Rod of Iron, by an Army that wished his utter Ru∣ine, was an Instance of a
prodigious Address, and shewed, that he was born for the Ruine of our
<HI>English</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>But yet, after all his Greatness both at home and abroad, some
things happened before his End, which much disturbed him; not only the
frequent Plots against his Person, but the Co∣ming up of a monstrous
Whale in the fresh Wa∣ter, contrary to the Nature of that Fish, as 
<PB N="207" REF="228"/> far as <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where it was taken, and
be∣lieved by many to portend some great Alteration in the Commonwealth: Yet
this did not so much trouble the Protector, as the Death of his dear Daughter
<HI>Claypole,</HI> who died in the Beginning of <HI>August</HI> 1658. He had
settled his greatest Affection upon this Daughter, from the time of whose
Death he appeared very melancholy, and fell sick about the Middle of
<HI>August</HI>; but his Sickness being only an Ague, there was no
Ap∣prehensions of his Death; and he declared pub∣lickly to his Physicians,
and many others, <HI>That God would not take him away, till he done some more
Work for him.</HI> But it soon appeared, that if God did not, the Devil did
take him; for he died the Third of <HI>September</HI> following: A Day that had
been so fortunate to him proved his last in this World; and such a
Tempest ac∣companied his Death that Night, as was not seen in the Memory of
Man: Great Trees in <HI>St. James</HI>'s Park were blown up by the Roots, of
which I was an Eye Witness. The large strong Pales, which made up the
Breach on <HI>London</HI> Bridge (caused by a violent Fire some Years
before) were blown down; many Boats cast away upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> great
Shipwrecks at Sea, besides several by the Storm, in divers Parts of
<HI>England,</HI> by Land. The Prince of the Air shewed his Power was above
the Pro∣tector's, who thought not fit that he should part quietly out of this
World, who had made such a Combustion, Trouble, and Misery in it. He was
a Person indeed, who, by his Arts of Dis∣sembling, <PB N="208" REF="229"/>
Wickedness, and Murder, attained to the Height of Greatness: He made
foreign Nations know more of <HI>England</HI>'s Strength, than any of our Kings
of late Years had done. Besides, he had all Parts of Policy so
necessary for an Usurper, and had so perfectly learnt the Art of
Dissembling, that, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven (whose Heart was far
from it) and his Hand laid on his Breast, he would pray, cry, and act the
Saint, till he had fully accom∣plished his Designs.</P>
<P>After <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Death, his Son <HI>Richard</HI> be∣ing
named in the Petition and Advice, succeeded as Protector; but having nothing
of his late Father's Spirit or Parts, was unfit to hold what his late Father
had got, and so was quickly turned out and deposed by his ambitious and
jealous Kindred, without drawing his Sword for it. Then, at the Army's Call,
that filthy Part of the Commons called the Juncto, retur∣ned back to govern;
who not pleasing their over-powerful Masters, the Army, they were a
second time expulsed by the Army. Then a Creature of the Army's begetting
(with a new Name of their own devising) called, <HI>The Com∣mittee of
Safety,</HI> was substituted, which occa∣sioned a great Difference
betwixt the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, the latter declaring a
great Dissatisfaction against the Proceedings of the former, and the
Contest ended by the Divisi∣ons in the <HI>English</HI> Army, their
Mutinery and Mouldring away, whilst the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, un∣der the
Command of the prudent <HI>Fabius,</HI> Gene∣ral <PB N="209" REF="230"/>
<HI>Monk,</HI> advanced towards <HI>London,</HI> whose Coming and Design
had been prevented, if timorous <HI>Fleetwood</HI> had made good his Promise
of sending first to the King, the Great Seal, with the Keeper of it, to
assure his Majesty of their Repentance and Resolution to call in the
King; which was agreed betwixt <HI>Fleetwood</HI> and the Keeper, who was ready
to go with the Great Seal: But some Officers, then in Being in the Army,
opposed <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s Resolution, who had before promised them to
do nothing without their Consent, of that Nature; and so the whole
Business was set aside, when the Keeper was ready to go with the Great
Seal.</P>
<P>It was the King's great Happiness, that <HI>Monk</HI> never
owned his Design of serving the King, till it fell in his Power. If he had
declared his Resolution sooner, he had destroyed himself; and the
Assurance that the Parliament had, that <HI>Monk</HI> had no such
Intention, hindered those Obstructions which probably would have ruined his
Credit with his own Army, and united the rest of the Forces against him. It
is true, that he was the Instrument to bring that to pass, which certainly
he had neither Wisdom to fore∣see, nor Understanding to contrive, he
being a phlegmatick dull Person, till he was awakened by his Officers, who
thought him in great Dan∣ger by pulling down the Gates of the City of
<HI>London:</HI> And therefore his Officers perswaded him to march again into
the City, and then he declared to the Citizens (at Alderman <HI>Wate</HI>'s
House) whom I knew very well, and at which <PB N="210" REF="231"/> time I
lodged at Mr. <HI>Clargy</HI>'s House, an Apo∣thecary near
<HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> whose Sister was married to <HI>Monk.</HI> This
Apothecary was a very active stirring Man, and full of Intrigues, and I
believe he prevailed much with his Brother <HI>Monk,</HI> to induce him to do
what he did: For, whilst he was at Alderman <HI>Wate</HI>'s, he then
assured the Citizens, that he would live and die with them, which gave them
great Joy, and put the Parliament in some Disorder; where∣upon they sent
some Members to treat with him, upon which he returned to <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
and then sent for the Members of both Parties, for those that were turned
out of Parliament in the Year 1648, and delivers a Paper to them in Writing,
which his Secretary read to them; and then they all thought, that he really
in∣tended the Establishing a Commonwealth: But no sooner was the
Conference ended, but the Members that had been excluded from 1648, entered the
House of Commons, and presently dissolved themselves; which really
contributed as much to his Majesty's Service, as if really <HI>Monk</HI> had
designed it at the first: But whether he did, or did not, I think is yet a
great Que∣stion, the wisest amongst us believing he never at first
intended it, but that it fell into his Lap, to make our Nation happy, by
restoring the right Heir to the Crown, without the Assi∣stance of any
foreign Prince, which was a Hap∣piness beyond our Expectation or
Desert.</P>
<P>But before the almost miraculous Restoration of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. and his coming to the Go∣vernment, <PB N="211" REF="232"/>
I think something may be said, tho' not in Vindication, yet in Mitigation,
of the Crimes committed by some Members in that Long Parliament, in which
unhappy Times the Crown was even laid in the Dust, and the Justice of the
King's Cause did not prevail against those malignant Spirits (who had
de∣signed the King's Ruine) and had misled and corrupted the
Understandings of many of his Majesty's Subjects, who were over-perswaded
by the specious Shew of <HI>Salus Populi suprema Lex,</HI> and thro'
Mistakes and Inconveniences then introduced (tho' not intended by the late
King) did, in those calamitous Times, rather weakly than wilfully,
transgress their Bounds of Duty, and did not pay the Reverence and
Obedience to the fundamental Laws of the Land, which they should have done,
but were led by the wicked Insinuation of others, being confident that many,
from their Hearts, ab∣horred every Article of that strange and un∣heard of
Rebellion, and most heartily depreca∣ted the Miseries that followed it; and
yet they themselves contributed to it, and to those very Votes from whence
those Evils they abhorred did naturally spring; not considering, that
when their Consultations tended to lessen or infringe the Power and
Dignity of their King, they meddled with that which was not in their
Determination, and which the King ought to have maintained with the Sacrifice
of his Life: And we may well believe, those Miseries could never have been
brought upon the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion, <PB N="212" REF="233"/> nor that
Violence committed upon the sa∣cred Person of his then Majesty, if
those pro∣fligated Villains that designed it, had not first violated the
Parliament, by forcibly excluding those Members, who would never have
consen∣ted to so execrable an Attempt, since they had avowed and
covenanted for Defence and Safety of the King's Person, which was ever before
dear to Parliaments: And none can think of that horrid Act committed against
the precious Life of our Sovereign, but with Detestation, and such
Abhorrence, that Words are wanting to express it. And had I the Voice of
<HI>Stentor,</HI> nay, of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> I could not sufficiently
de∣claim against it; and next to wishing it had never been, we wish it
may never be remem∣bered, but with that Grief and Trouble of Mind it
deserves, being the greatest Reproach to our <HI>English</HI> Nation that
it ever yet incurred, tho' the Nation it self, as well as several Mem∣bers
of Parliament were innocent of it, which was the only Contrivance and Act of
some ambitious blood-thirsty Persons, hoping the di∣vine Justice will
not impute the Evil of it to the whole Kingdom, and involve the Guiltless
with the Guilty.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE REIGN and GOVERNMENT OF K. <HI>CHARLES</HI>
the II<SUP>d.</SUP></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER the deplorable Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. fitter
to be writ∣ten in Tears of Blood than Ink, or rather to have a Veil drawn over
it, that it may never be re∣membered, to the eternal Shame of the
<HI>English</HI> Nation, his Son, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was crowned King
in <HI>Scotland</HI>; but it was up∣on such hard Terms, that it was a
Question, <PB N="216" REF="236"/> whether the Crown was worth accepting.
How∣ever, as the King's Affairs then stood, it was judged best to accept of
it, preferring the em∣pty Title of a King in his own Dominions, to the empty
Title of a King in another Nation. And yet it was thought strange, that the
King would put himself into the Hands of that Na∣tion, whose Army had
treated his royal Father so perfidiously; the Selling and Delivering him to
the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> being the most barbarous Action that any
People were ever guilty of; and their Honour can never be re∣paired for the
Horridness of that most wicked Crime. However, the late King
<HI>Charles</HI> could not be much blamed, in the sad Posture of his
Affairs, for going to that Army, to which he was so kindly invited, having
been ever a great Lover of that Nation, not only having been born there, but
educated by them; and there∣fore thought he should find there his greatest
Security, where he found the most Danger. But indeed such strange
Circumstances contri∣buted to his Ruine, that we might think Hea∣ven and
Earth had conspired against him, who was from the Beginning so much
betrayed by his own Servants, that very few remained faith∣ful to him; and yet
their Treachery proceeded rather from some particular Animosities amongst
themselves, than from any treasonable Intent to do the King Harm: And
notwithstanding he was reduced to so miserable a Fate, yet it is most
certain he had as great a Share in the Hearts and Affections of his Subjects in
gene∣ral, <PB N="217" REF="237"/> and was as much beloved and esteemed by
them, as any of his Predecessors: But it was our Wantonness under the
Happiness we en∣joyed beyond any other Nation, and our own Sins, which
brought that Judgment upon us. The strange Transactions in
<HI>England,</HI> which began in the Year 1641, are not to be paral∣lelled for
the wonderful Passages therein; we then saw <HI>England,</HI> in the
highest Pitch of worldly Happiness, fall to the lowest Degree of
Misfortune and Misery.</P>
<P>I know very well, how unsearchable the Se∣crets of Princes
are, in what an Abyss they lye, and how much too deep to be sounded by our
Discourses; but when I remember the Turns of those Times, I seem rather
to dream, than to think the Relation true, of so many surpri∣zing
Revolutions, which are scarce credible in this our Age. The best of Kings
was then condemned by merciless Rebels, after being abandoned by his
nearest Friends, and pursued by his fiercest Enemies, who furiously
seized upon his sacred Person, and at last took away his Life, and
triumphed in their own Wicked∣ness with successful Insolence for some
Years, when, at last, by God's Providence, the right∣ful Heir to the Crown
was brought home to his own People, without the Assistance of any foreign
Prince, in as full Exercise of his Go∣vernment, as any of his
Predecessors ever en∣joyed, and by many of the same Men, who had before
been very active in the Miseries of the Kingdom, and Destruction of their
own <PB N="218" REF="238"/> Country; and yet the Sufferings of the royal Family
were all recovered, by the concurring Hand of divine Providence. By which we
may see, when Subjects make Victories over their Princes, they are Triumphs
over them∣selves; and those Men which will force Laws which they are bound
to preserve, will, in the End, find all their Victories full of Trou∣bles,
bringing Ruine to their Authors.</P>
<P>But, leaving this Digression, let us see what is become of
our King in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who car∣ried many eminent faithful Subjects with
him thither, who were nothing at all esteemed by the <HI>Scots,</HI> who
chose a particular Council, by whose Advice the King was to govern, who
gave the <HI>Scots</HI> great Satisfaction in all things they desired of him:
And, upon his being crowned in <HI>Scotland, Cromwell</HI> was declared
General, and prepared for a War, and marched with his Army, which he had before
modelled to his own Mind, commanded absolutely, dis∣countenancing and
suppressing all who had been supported by General <HI>Fairfax.</HI> The
Indepen∣dants had all the Credit about <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the Pulpits were
open to all that would shew their Gifts, and great Distraction and
Confusion in Religion then governed. The <HI>Scots</HI> raised an Army
against <HI>Cromwell,</HI> supplied with all things necessary, but
Prudence, Courage, and Conduct. The King desired that he might command the
Army, since he was to run the Fortune of it; but the <HI>Scots</HI> would
scarce give him Leave to see it. <HI>Cromwell</HI> enters <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="239"/> as far as <HI>Dunbar,</HI> but was soon reduced to
great Distress, for want of all Necessaries. The <HI>Scots</HI> really
believed they had the <HI>English</HI> at their Mercy; and it is certain, if
the <HI>Scots</HI> had only kept their Trenches, and sent Parties of Horse
after the <HI>English,</HI> they would have marched off, and left their
Cannon and heavy Baggage behind: But <HI>Cromwell</HI> seeing the
<HI>Scotch</HI> Army decamp, and follow him, he then made a Stand with his
Army, and the <HI>Scots</HI> soon found they were not upon so clear a
Chase as they imagined, being so clearly defeated by <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
that he was that Night, being the Third of <HI>September,</HI> Master both of
<HI>Leith</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> The <HI>Scots,</HI> like the
Anabaptists in <HI>Germany,</HI> pretended at first nothing but Faith and
true Fear of God, and declared against Riches and Honours as Vanity; and upon
the great Opinion of their Humility and Devotion, they had procured much
Esteem; and after they had ensnared many with their Hypocrisy, they would
reform both Church and State: And having gotten Power, and enriched
them∣selves with the Spoils of <HI>England,</HI> they thought then to
justify themselves by our Saviour's Pro∣mise, that <HI>The Meek should
inherit the Earth.</HI> When they first entered <HI>England,</HI> their
Success crowned their Work, and they were thought a wise and resolute
Nation; for, after an unbloody War, for above one Year, they returned laden
with Spoils and great Riches, and were liberally rewarded, as well for going
out, as coining in∣to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="240"/>It seems the King, in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
was so far from being in their late Battle at <HI>Dunbar,</HI> that he was
not admitted into their Councils or Ar∣my: But to redeem their former Error,
they resolved to raise a new Army, to be comman∣ded by the King in
Person, hoping to pass ano∣ther Way bye <HI>Cromwell</HI> into
<HI>England,</HI> intending to make the Seat of the War there, and made the
highest Professions of Duty to his Majesty, that could be invented, and
gave great Promi∣ses to the King, of what Demonstrations of Zeal and Duty
they would suddenly shew him.</P>
<P>The King began his March, which was long and terrible, and
several Engagements passed in the Way, with different Success, but
most of them to the King's Disadvantage, who, in the End, arrived at
<HI>Worcester</HI> with his shattered Army, and was there as clearly
defeated by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> the Third of <HI>September,</HI> as the
<HI>Scots</HI> were the Year before at <HI>Dunbar.</HI> The King's Escape,
after the Loss of this Battle, was very miraculous, being preserved by a
wonderful Providence from the Fury of his blood-thirsty Rebels. His Majesty
first met in a Wood, not far from <HI>Boscobell,</HI> with Captain
<HI>Careless,</HI> who perswaded the King to get up into an Oaken Tree:
From thence he went into a Cottage, where he lay in a Barn, and was then
condu∣cted to another House by Father <HI>Huddleston,</HI> who was sent
to him by <HI>Careless,</HI> who after brought him to the Lord
<HI>Wilmot,</HI> who con∣ducted the King to Mr. <HI>Lane</HI>'s House; from
whence the King rode before young Mrs. <HI>Lane,</HI> <PB N="221" REF="241"/> to
her Cousin <HI>Norton</HI> near <HI>Bristol,</HI> where the King was known
to the Butler. From thence the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> took the King into
<HI>Sussex,</HI> to Collonel <HI>Gunter</HI>'s, and from thence brought the
King into <HI>Normandy,</HI> who had ever after a great Esteem for his
Lordship. There was in∣deed such a Concurrence of Charity, good Na∣ture and
Generosity, in Persons of the meanest Extraction, and hardest Fortune,
who knew the Delivery of the King would have been of great Advantage to them,
that we may look upon the King's Escape as conducted by Hands of the
Almighty, who covered him as with a Shield, when his rebellious People sought
his Life, who was still concealed from their most diligent Search, wherein
Father <HI>Huddleston</HI> was very instrumental: And tho' many knew where
the King was, and those very poor, yet none were tempted by great Rewards,
and more pow∣erful Fears, to betray the King, who after ma∣ny Changes of
Station, and Misfortunes, after this miraculous Manner, was brought into
<HI>France,</HI> and at last brought home to his own People: And tho' he was
forced away by a Whirlwind of Rebellion, he was restored to his Three
Kingdoms with the still Voice of Peace and Mercy; a happy Presage how his
Majesty would govern, whose Reign, at least the Begin∣ning of it,
shewed sufficiently his meek and ge∣nerous Temper. In the time of the
King's Ba∣nishment, he spent two Years at <HI>Cologne,</HI> where he was
well received by a Widow, at whose House he lodged. Before his going to
<HI>Cologne,</HI> <PB N="222" REF="242"/> his Family was in great Disorder;
but at his being there, by Direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, his
Family was put under the Care and Management of Sir <HI>Stephen Fox,</HI> who
kept it in excellent Order. The King was then of a very merciful Nature, and at
that time it was very agreeable to his Inclination, not to have the Penal Laws
put in Execution; and tho' it was not in his Power to repeal them, yet it was
never in his Will to execute them; and his Majesty was then very forward to
do all he could for the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks in that kind: But when he
came into <HI>England,</HI> he soon changed his Mind, and proved in the End
very severe against the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, who desi∣red to live
quietly, but could not be allowed to do so.</P>
<P>Upon this King's most happy Restoration, there was seen
from all Parts his loyal Subjects contending how to express their Gratitude
to Heaven, for its glorious Favour, and the King's no less than miraculous
Return, and for the manifold Blessings they were like to enjoy un∣der the
benign Reign of so excellent a Prince, every Man striving who should
first pay the humble Oblation of their Duties, which really proceeded from
Hearts full of Reverence and Obedience to his sacred Person; being
possessed with a deep Sense of the Honour and good For∣tune they had
to be born his Subjects: And, indeed, who could forbear to be transported
with Joy, that was going to receive his King? And who could contain the
Overflowings of his <PB N="223" REF="243"/> Heart, when he could say, <HI>I
have my KING again?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, that when the Nation had been so long mad, after
so many Changes and Revolu∣tions, and our Progress from bad to worse, we
might with Reason have expected, God should have sent us the worst of
Tyrants, some Infi∣del or Usurper, to scourge us with Whips, as we well
deserved: But he was so gracious as to send us our own King, the
undoubted Heir to the Crown, to redeem our Nation from the In∣famy it had
undergone, and to restore it to all it had lost, and to make the People as
happy as they ought to be. In order to which, the King gave a general Pardon to
all (excepting only such as should be excepted by Parliament) and that no
Person whatsoever, for any Crime committed, either against his late royal
Father, or against the present King's sacred Person, should ever be
brought in Question, to the least Damage of Life, Liberty, or Estate, or
even to the Prejudice of his Reputation, or any other Reproach or Term of
Distinction: And the King did then also declare a Liberty to tender
Consciences, and that none should be disquie∣ted, or called in Question
for Difference of Opinion in Matters of Religion, which did not disturb the
Peace or Settlement of the Kingdom. And further, to let his Subjects see how
to practise the Art of Forgetfulness, which they should learn from him,
his Majesty did then put some Men into eminent Employs, who had before
disserved him; so that every Man might <PB N="224" REF="244"/> capacitate
himself, by his future Behaviour, for any Place. But this Conduct seemed to
some like a trimming Indifferency, to disoblige his old Friends, in hopes
of getting new ones, which hath usually been the Subversion of
Go∣vernments; and no wise Counsellour would ad∣vise his Prince to grieve
his old Friends, to make his old Enemies rejoice. However, as the Posture of
the King's Affairs then stood, he was obliged to take such Measures; but
whether, at last, the King found his End in them, is yet a great Question.
For, as the Judgments of God, have, in all Ages, reached those at last, who
have secretly taken away the Lives of Princes, or have been in open
Rebel∣lion against their lawful Kings, so his Justice did at last, in
<HI>England,</HI> become the Revenger of Blood, and pursued those that
killed and took Possession, after they had boasted of their
Wickedness for several Years, and brought them at last to condign
Punishment, to let the World see and know, that Rebellion is criminal, even
when it is prosperous; and tho' God may forbear for some time to punish,
yet he always does it justly at last: For tho' God hath leaden Feet, and is
slow in punishing, yet he hath Iron Hands, and strikes home in the End:
And here, that some Compensation might be made for the Loss of the Royal
Father, which was irreparable, God gave the Crown to his eldest Son. It is
most certain, that King <HI>Charles</HI> II. at his first coming to the
Throne, had most reconciling Thoughts, who gave large Evidence of them, 
<PB N="225" REF="245"/> after so high a Distemper, and such a universal
shaking the Foundations of Government, desi∣ring and commanding his
Parliament to take Care to repair the Breaches, and to use such
Circumspection and Industry, as might provide things necessary for
strengthening those Repairs, and to prevent for the future whatever might
disturb or weaken the common Interest; re∣commending to his Parliament a
general Union, as the best, if not the only Way for their own Security, and
the Happiness of the whole King∣dom. This King, indeed, at his Restoration,
was glorious in the Eyes of all his Subjects: Those great Deliverances which
the divine Goodness had afforded to his royal Person from many imminent
Dangers, and the Support which it gave to his heroick princely Mind, under
such various Tryals, made it appear, that he was precious in God's Sight, and
as Gold out of the Fire: He was restored to his People and Patrimony with
more Splendor and Dignity, who had made a right Use of his Afflictions, and
taken such Observations of other Countries, that he really intended to make
all his Subjects the better for what he had seen and suffered abroad.</P>
<P>It is true, that, in the Beginning of this King's Reign, the
Doctrine of the Court was, <HI>Sow a little, that ye may reap much</HI>; and
those who were then entrusted with the Nation's Purse, were themselves
for diving into the Prince's Pocket; and that too generous Prince, at his
first coming to the Crown, was soon over-perswaded <PB N="226" REF="246"/>
to give away the greatest Part of his Crown Lands. The Courtier begged, and
the Citizen bought, and the King was soon di∣vested of all; and yet they
who suffered for his late royal Father, were not the better for all his
immoderate Bounties. These his great Li∣beralities were not given as the
Recompence of ancient Merit, but were bestowed either as Re∣wards of Vice, or
Price of Treachery; so that the worst Men made the best Advantage: And
tho' the King did then what was very prejudi∣cial to the Crown; yet such was
the flourishing Condition of the <HI>English</HI> at that time, that the
People could bear a great deal of ill Manage∣ment: Besides, some were glad
to see a young King that would soon be necessitated by his ex∣travagant
Bounty to depend upon his People, who did then begin to apprehend, that the
King did meditate an arbitrary Power. Now, whatever Ground the great
Counsellours of those Times had, there was no Bar put in the Way of that
destructive Bounty; but as ill∣gotten Goods seldom prosper, very little
of what was obtained remained long in the Hands of the first
Possessor, but all was soon dispersed into a Multitude of Hands,
and the Silence of those who then had a Right to complain, seemed in some
measure to have justified such Proceed∣ings: And tho' the King, being
then young, airy and liberal, was much to blame for per∣mitting such a Spoil
to be made of his Revenue; yet they (whose Duty it was to take Care of the
Body Politick) suffered the Distemper to <PB N="227" REF="247"/> proceed too
far; and what the King did was then winked at, because the Courtiers (who
were nearest the King's Person) got all, and and the great Trade and Wealth
of the <HI>English</HI> might bear such Gifts, which were not then
supplied by new and heavy Taxes, which the People after found excessive
in a following Reign. However, this great Oversight of the King should
teach wise Princes to distinguish betwixt those that serve them for
their own Ends, and those that have only in their View the Interest and
Honour of the King their Ma∣ster: But we always see Compliance and
Flatte∣ry get the better of Honesty and plain Dealing, Princes usually
loving those best that dispute not with them, and prefer them before
such as advise them really what is best for their Service. This kind of
Flattery is a Plant so preserved in most Courts, that it never fails of
bringing most dangerous Fruit, and Princes very seldom discover it, till
it be too late, and that they are ruined by it. I must confess, it would be
a great Advantage to Princes, and to their Sub∣jects a great Happiness, to
have plain Truths delivered to them with Decency and Privacy, from their most
faithful Servants, whereby they might redress many Mistakes of their
Judg∣ments or Will; which brings to my Mind what <HI>Tom Killigrew,</HI> a
Groom of the Bed-Chamber to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. said, as he was under
his Barber's Hands: A Book being in the Window, in which <HI>Killigrew</HI> was
looking, it being a Book of his own Plays, of which the King taking 
<PB N="228" REF="248"/> Notice, he asked him, <HI>What Account he would give
at the Day of Judgment, of all the idle Words in that Book? Why truly,</HI>
says <HI>Killigrew, I shall give a better Account of all the idle Words in
this Book, than your Majesty shall do of all your idle Promises, and more
idle Patents, which have undone many; but my idle Words in this Book have
undone no Person.</HI> This was a bold and sharp Repartee; but the King
being an in∣dulgent Master, and not of a Disposition to do harsh
things, gave <HI>Killigrew</HI> a great Liberty of Fooling; for otherwise he
must needs have ta∣ken Notice of that bitter Reflection, which the King did
not: But if the Substance of that Sar∣casm had been told the King decently
and pri∣vately, it might have had a good Operation; whereas what was spoken
was then taken for a Jest only, and so the King passed it by. Now if we
seriously reflect on the first Twelve Years of this King's Government, we
shall not find in the like Space of Time, either at home or abroad, so
great Plenty of all things for the Delight of Mankind, nor find so long a
Time free from Injustice and Oppression, where the King and Lords did
less oppress the Commons, and where there was so great a
Condescension to tender Consciences: And if it be true, that as <HI>Multa
funera sunt opprobria Medicorum,</HI> so <HI>Multa supplicia sunt
opprobria Principum</HI>; it must be much for the Honour and Memory of this
King, that in his first Twelve Years Go∣vernment, there was not one Nobleman
put to Death, and so few of all others at the Assizes, 
<PB N="229" REF="249"/> that the like was never known in the Memory of Man; and
yet impartial Justice was executed every where. I heartily wish I could
have said the same to this King's Death, for then un∣doubtedly he would
have been <HI>CHARLES the Good,</HI> tho' not <HI>CHARLES the Great.</HI></P>
<P>But alas! there now began to be a great Vi∣cissitude of good
and bad Events, and a very unsettled and various Management of publick
Affairs, and not with such a Steadiness of Con∣duct as the fresh
Experience of our then late Misfortunes might have instructed those with
Courage and Constancy that were entrusted with them: But those
Ministers that then ser∣ved the King at the Helm of his Government, were
much to blame to suffer such things, which were quickly reduced to a most
unhappy Con∣dition, betwixt the King and his ill-natured obstinate Subjects
then assembled in Parliament, that by his Majesty's condescending to
some things, which seemed of little or no Conse∣quence when first
yielded unto, yet they were afterwards made the Foundation of a great Battery
against the King's Authority, Reputa∣tion, and Strength of his Government:
But it was our own Ingratitude under so many great Advantages we then enjoyed
beyond other Peo∣ple, which drew those Judgments from Heaven upon us. I
confess, the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks who were peaceable and innocent,
suffered at this time many grievous Persecutions, which were not only
permitted by the King, but his Par∣liament was encouraged therein, tho' the
King <PB N="230" REF="250"/> was not ignorant of their Innocence: Yet, to
Persons that knew those Times, and how con∣tinually the King was teazed by
those ill-na∣tured Gentlemen of the House of Commons, it will be the less
Wonder, that such things should happen in the Days of such a Prince, who
had so yielding a Nature as the King. 'Tis true, the great Persecutions
which the Christians suf∣fered under the good Reign of <HI>Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, were all impu∣ted to him, how
justly I cannot say; but our King did not only connive, but would often
rally at the Extravagance of the House of Commons: And yet this I may truly
say, that tho' he gave unlawful Permission to persecute the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, whom he knew to be innocent; yet he always stood
firm to keep the Succession of his Crown in its due and lawful Descent,
and would never yield to have it alte∣red, tho' he was pressed very
violently to it, by great Artifices, which made him often prorogue Parliaments,
and the King continued resolute in this Point, even to his Death.</P>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1672, Mr. <HI>Borell</HI> the <HI>Holland</HI>
Mini∣ster, was with his Majesty, and desired the Ad∣mission of four
Deputies from the States Gene∣ral, to know what the King desired, and said
as many were appointed for <HI>France</HI>; but the King refused their
Admission, and said, he would do nothing without the Participation of his
Allies: However, he would be so generous as to do what he could that lay in
his Power, and then named the Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> his Envoy 
<PB N="231" REF="251"/> Extraordinary to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and would
send him to confer with that King upon their Proposals, and it was said
he should go thro' <HI>Holland,</HI> and take Sir <HI>Gabriel Sylvius</HI>
with him.</P>
<P>The Sixteenth of <HI>January</HI> following, the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> had the same Censure from the House of Commons as the
Duke of <HI>Lauder∣dale</HI> had, to be both banished from the King's
Presence for ever: Whereupon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> desired to be
heard in the House of Commons, which was granted to him, and his Business
was to lay all the Blame upon the Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> who also
answered in the House, and behaved himself so well, that he got
immortal Reputation, to be a Man of Abi∣lity, Prudence, Conduct, and of great
Tem∣per, and so escaped the Censure of the House.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Marquis de Fresno,</HI>
Am∣bassador Extraordinary from <HI>Spain,</HI> presented to the King a
very warm Memorial, menacing a War, unless the King would embrace a Peace
with <HI>Holland,</HI> upon these Three Points. The First was, The Flag to
Content, with Eight Hundred Thousand Pattacoons, and the mutual Restitution
of Places and Prizes taken in <HI>Eu∣rope:</HI> To which his Majesty returned
this fol∣lowing Answer.</P>
<P>That, if they would add a Promise to regu∣late the <HI>East
India</HI> Trade, give Liberty of De∣parture to the <HI>English</HI> at
<HI>Surinam,</HI> and not to Fish on the <HI>English</HI> Coast without
Permission; as to his Majesty, he would be content: But 
<PB N="232" REF="252"/> that the Place of Treaty must be <HI>Cologne,</HI> and
Respect paid to the Mediation of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which could not be avoided,
because it was accepted by all: But because his Majesty's Answer to the
said Memorial may be fully seen, I shall here repeat it, which was sent
to me by the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> then Secretary of State.</P>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="statement">
<P>His Majesty having seen and considered a
Me∣morial delivered to him by his Excellency the <HI>Marquis de Fresno,</HI>
Ambassador Extraordinary from the Catholick King, bearing Date the 20th of
<HI>December</HI> Instant, commands this Answer to be made
thereunto.</P>
<P>THAT he was not a little surprized to find the
Contents of this Paper confirmed to him the Report of a Treaty made betwixt the
King his Master and the <HI>States General of the United Provinces,</HI> the
Assisting of whom in this War was a manifest Breach of the separate
Article in the Treaty betwixt the two Kings, binding them reciprocally; not to
assist each other's Enemies in any open War: And his Majesty's Wonder
there∣upon hath been the greater, that the Treaty with the <HI>States
General</HI> was never owned to him by the Ambassador himself, or by any
other <HI>Spanish</HI> Minister; and that his Excellency was pleased to
look upon it (when the Rumour there∣of came first abroad) as a malicious
Invention of the Enemies of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> diffused only to
create a Misunderstanding betwixt his Majesty and that Crown: Whereas now
it seemed <PB N="233" REF="253"/> to be a real Thing, and does no less,
according to the Tenor of the said Memorial, than threaten a War to his
Majesty, if he will not submit him∣self to Conditions imposed upon him
by his de∣clared Enemies: Notwithstanding which, his Majesty esteems
himself in some Degree beholden to the Catholick Queen, for having imparted
to him the Terms and Conditions upon which the <HI>States General of the United
Provinces</HI> will be content to make a Peace; since, in so many Months
that his Majesty's Plenipotentiaries have been at <HI>Cologne,</HI> their
Deputies could never be brought to make a clear Declaration of any Offers they
would stand to, but held them still under such Ambiguities, as they might
at all times re∣cede from them as they should see Cause.</P>
<P>Now, altho' the Conditions offered in the said
Memorial are very small, in respect of the great Expence of Blood and
Treasure that War hath cost; yet, that the World may see how desirous
his Majesty is to contribute to the general Peace of Christendom, he
declares he will be contented with any reasonable Conditions for a Peace
suitable to his Honour, and the Interest of his Subjects.</P>
<P>The Offers made in his Excellency's Name are, 
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> The Flag to be adjusted to
his Majesty's Satisfaction.</ITEM>
<ITEM> <HI>Secondly,</HI> A reciprocal Restitution of
Places and Prizes that are, or may have been taken, during the late War.</ITEM>
<ITEM> <PB N="234" REF="254"/><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Sum
of Eight Hundred Thou∣sand Pattacoons.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now, if the <HI>States General</HI> will extinguish
their Pretences to the Restitution of Prizes, as a Thing impracticable, and
never insisted upon in any Treaty of Peace, and to the above-named Offers
add these additional ones, which cannot well be denied: 
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> An equal and reciprocal
Regulation of Trade in the <HI>East Indies,</HI> as was promised
par∣ticularly in the late Treaty of <HI>Bredah.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM> <HI>Secondly,</HI> Leave to his Majesty's
Subjects yet detained at <HI>Surinam,</HI> to depart thence, with their
Estates and Effects, pursuant to the said Treaty, and their own
reiterated Promises and Orders.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the <HI>States
General</HI> shall, for the future, abstain from Fishing upon the
Coasts and Shores of any of his Majesty's Dominions, without Leave and
Passport first obtained:</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>His Majesty declares, that, as to himself, he will
be content with these Conditions. But, because the Wording of the Articles
thereupon is of equal Moment to the Things that shall be contained in them,
and that this cannot be ef∣fected but by Persons equally intrusted and
im∣powered on both Sides, his Majesty farther de∣clares, That he will direct
his Plenipotentiaries at <HI>Cologne,</HI> to apply themselves, together with
the Deputies of the <HI>States General,</HI> thereupon, <PB N="235" REF="255"/>
with the Mediators of the Crown of <HI>Sweden;</HI> who having been accepted
and authorized on both Sides, and the City of <HI>Cologne</HI> having been
insisted upon by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to the Media∣tors, for the Place of
Treaty; his Majesty con∣ceiveth, that neither the Place nor the Media∣tors
can be declined, without a notorious Offence to the Parties concerned, and more
particularly to the Honour of the Crown of <HI>Sweden.</HI> And his Majesty
assureth himself, that this his Pro∣ceeding will appear so fair and
equal to the Ca∣tholick Queen, as not to lessen in any Degree, in her royal
Breast, the Esteem she professes to have for his Friendship and
Alliance, which his Ma∣jesty hath ever used, to his utmost Endeavour, to
cultivate and improve; particularly, in making himself the principal
Interest of the two Peaces of <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI>
so valuable to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the Minority of their King;
and in continuing the Peace between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> from any
Violation or Distur∣bance by this present War, as he did in the Treaty made
with the most Christian King, when he en∣tered into the Union and
Confederation with him, against the <HI>States General of the United
Provinces.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="236" REF="256"/>Upon this Memorial, many Members of
Parliament had the States Generals Reply to his Majesty's Answer to the
Memorial, sent inclosed to them in Print, before the King had received the
Original. Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> had four Copies sent him in several
Pacquets, which he forthwith carried to the Lord Keeper, and his Lordship to
the King; by which may be seen what incongruous things the States Ge∣neral
suffered, who endeavoured to dethrone his Majesty, by their Appeal to his
People, without taking Notice of the King. The Ori∣ginal of this Reply of the
States General was sent to his Excellency the <HI>Marquis de Fresno,</HI>
who thought it too scandalous for him to offer, and sent it back to the
States with great In∣dignation: But towards the End of <HI>January,</HI> his
Excellency presented a Letter from the States General to the King, wherein
they granted Five of the Six Points in a full Manner, but they refused any
Acknowledgment for the Fishing. The Ninth of <HI>February</HI> following, the
Peace betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> was Signed and Sealed by
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador, as Plenipo∣tentiary for
<HI>Holland,</HI> and by six Privy-Coun∣sellours on the <HI>English</HI>
Side, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lord Keeper, the Lord High Treasurer, Duke of
<HI>Monmouth,</HI> Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> with the two principal Secretaries
of State. The Scope of the Peace was as follows.</P>
<P>The Treaty of <HI>Bredah</HI> remains firm, the Ma∣rine Treaty
confirmed for Nine Months, and that Commissioners should presently meet
to <PB N="237" REF="257"/> regulate the <HI>East India</HI> Trade, in which
Regu∣lation <HI>Spain</HI> to be left the Umpire, as it is the Guaranty of the
whole Treaty; <HI>New-York</HI> to be restored; the <HI>English</HI> to
come from <HI>Surinam</HI>; Eight Hundred Thousand Pattacoons to be paid in
the Time specified; the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships to strike in the
<HI>British</HI> Seas, from Cape <HI>Fenestre</HI> to the <HI>Naze</HI> in
<HI>Norway:</HI> An Article for hindering each from succouring the Enemies of
the other; but no mention is made of the Fishing, that remaining in the
same Condition it formerly was. <HI>France</HI> seemed much displeased
at this Peace; but it was believed his Majesty of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> would
interpose as Mediator, which was not what most <HI>Englishmen</HI>
desired, who would gladly see <HI>France</HI> reduced to the Treaty
<HI>Pyrrhe∣nean.</HI> The Peace betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>
being thus settled, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador took Leave of his
Majesty, and embarked on the <HI>Assistance</HI> Frigat, commanded by
Sir <HI>Richard Munden,</HI> and <HI>Don Emanuel de Lyra</HI> was named Envoy
in the Ambassador's Place; and I think it a Right owing to my Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> to in∣sert here a true Translation of the Letter which
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador wrote from <HI>St. Andrè</HI> in
in <HI>Spain,</HI> bearing Date the 30th of <HI>August</HI> 1674, which was
sent me by the Lord <HI>Arlington.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Most Excellent Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GRatitude will not permit me to lose any Occasion of
manifesting the same, which I now do by the Return of Sir <HI>Richard
Munden;</HI> for the Honours done me by his Majesty of <HI>Great</HI> 
<PB N="238" REF="258"/> <HI>Britain,</HI> have been so singular, and have
raised me so much Esteem and Glory, that my Obliga∣tion is not to be
expressed; so that I must beseech your Excellency to lay my Duty at
his Majesty's Feet, and to acquaint him of my Arrival in <HI>Spain,</HI>
which hath been with so prosperous and remarkable a Voyage, that on the
fifth Day in the Morning we discovered the Coast of <HI>Biscay;</HI> and
had I intended to go to the <HI>Groyn,</HI> we had been there that Day. In this
Dispatch I must attribute much to the great Care and Dexterity of our
Captain, and to his very courteous Usage of me, the better supporting all
the Trouble which the Inconveniences of the Sea would give a sick Man: And
for all this I pay to his Majesty (unto whose Grandeur it is due) infinite
Thanks, and shall still publish to the World my Sense and
Acknowledgments of All; and for the Friendship and Favour which I owe to your
Excellency, I shall always correspond with the sincerest Truth and
Passion I am able. God preserve your Ex∣cellency.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>But before I go farther, I will give an Ac∣count how I came to
these honourable Employ∣ments on this Side the Sea.</P>
<P>Be pleased then to know, that, at the Lord
<HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Death, which happened a little before the Burning of
<HI>London,</HI> I was, by the King's Command signified to me by the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> Principal Secretary of State, ap∣pointed to take Care of
his Funeral, and the Manner of it was then prescribed me. His 
<PB N="239" REF="259"/> Lordship was a Privy-Counsellour, Collonel of the
First Regiment of Foot Guards, and was before Major General of all the
Horse in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and General of the Horse in the West of
<HI>England,</HI> and, at his Death, was Gentleman of his Majesty's
Bed-chamber. When I had car∣ried his Body in State, as the King commanded, to
<HI>Teddington</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> to be buried with his
Ancestors, and that I returned to <HI>London,</HI> the Bills of the Charges
of the Funeral were brought to me, which I gave the Lord <HI>Arling∣ton</HI>;
but Money being then very rare, and the King no very good Paymaster, the
Merchants expected their Money from me; and the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> having
received some Money from me, which was due to some Companies of the
Regiment, the Captains thereof complaining that their Companies were not paid,
the Matter was left to be adjusted by the Duke of <HI>Albe∣marle,</HI> who
was General. The Merchants be∣ing very importunate for their Money, I thought
best to retire, and came to <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where many
<HI>English</HI> Officers coming daily, I was soon discovered, and taken
Prisoner, and at first was used very hardly by the Jayler, who had Orders
to keep me in his own Apartments, to eat and drink with him, and that I
should have Ten Shillings <HI>English</HI> daily allowed me, for Diet,
Lodging, and all Necessaries, which should be paid before I was
released; and Sir <HI>Mark d'Ogniati</HI> (who was of <HI>Bruges</HI>) and at
that time Resident for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> engaged
to see all punctually paid. <PB N="240" REF="260"/> When my Circumstances
were better known, I was used very well; and it being then that the King of
<HI>France</HI> began his Pretensions upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> in Right of the
<HI>Dauphin,</HI> and many <HI>Spanish</HI> Officers being then in
<HI>Bruges,</HI> I had every Day much Company, and knew all that passed in
the Army, of which I gave an Ac∣count each Post to the Earl of
<HI>Arlington,</HI> who being then Principal Secretary of State, shewed my
Letters to the King, who being pleased with them, asked the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> who sent those Letters? who thereupon told his
Majesty, that he had them from me, who was then a Prisoner in
<HI>Bruges:</HI> Whereupon the King presently an∣swered, that he had seen
no Letters that plea∣sed him so much, and that gave so clear Ac∣counts;
and that if I could give such Accounts in Prison, I should give much
better when out: And therefore the King bid his Lordship take Care, that I
should be forthwith released, and sent over to him; tho' his Majesty
knew I was at that time reconciled, and made a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, by
Father <HI>John Cross,</HI> who was Pre∣sident at <HI>Douay,</HI> and at
that time Confessor to the <HI>English</HI> Nuns in the Prince's Hoffe at
<HI>Bru∣ges.</HI> Upon this Intimation from the King, Sir <HI>Mark
d'Ogniati</HI> was desired by the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> to write to
<HI>Bruges,</HI> what the Account came to for my Imprisonment, and all
Necessa∣ries, and that all should be suddenly paid; up∣on which the
Jayler came to tell me the good News: But I told him I was very well where I
was, and being out of Danger, that I had a <PB N="241" REF="261"/> very good
Allowance, and could no where live so well, and that I would not stir from
Prison, unless, after paying all the Charges, I might have Money to put me
in Equipage, and then I would willingly and faithfully serve the King: That
from my Scituation in Prison I could see the Vanity and Hurry of the World,
where mi∣serable Men were daily distracting themselves in wearisom
contentious Wars, about the Great∣ness of an empty World; and I could look
safely upon them, never intermeddling with the Actions of others, but spend
my Thoughts in my own little Sphere, and lay down my Head in Peace, and sleep
securely in the Bosom of Providence. Within few Days after I had given this
Account, Money was sent to pay all the Charges of the Prison, with One
Hundred Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> to put me in good Equipage; the Return of
Money being then very high, and much to my Advantage, I received what Was
ordered, and was forthwith released from Prison.</P>
<P>So soon as I was at Liberty, I went to the Earl of
<HI>Castlehaven,</HI> and knowing he had a great Influence upon <HI>Don Pedro
de Ronquillos,</HI> who was Super-Intedant at <HI>Brussels,</HI> I
desired he would speak to <HI>Don Pedro</HI> in my Behalf, that I might be
Auditor to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Regiment of Foot; which Place was then vacant,
and the Regiment was National, commanded by Collo∣nel <HI>Scot</HI> of
<HI>Tekelah,</HI> Kinsman to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> Hereupon his
Lordship recommen∣ded me to <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> who was pleased to 
<PB N="242" REF="262"/> examine me, and finding me fit for the Employ∣ment, gave
me his Certificate to the Constable of <HI>Castile,</HI> who was then
Governour of the <HI>Spa∣nish Netherlands,</HI> in Place of <HI>Marquis
Castle Roderigo:</HI> But the Plague being then at <HI>Brussels,</HI> the
Constable stayed at <HI>Malines,</HI> and, upon pretending much
Indisposition of Health, de∣sired he might return into <HI>Spain.</HI>
However, he sent the <HI>Marquis de Velasco</HI> to compliment our King
upon his coming to the Government, who sent Sir <HI>Edward-Spraig</HI> to
return his Compli∣ment, and the Queen sent Mr. <HI>Roper</HI> on her Part. So
soon as the Plague ceased at <HI>Brussels,</HI> the Constable
returned thither, where I found a Way to speak to him, and gave him <HI>Don
Pedro</HI>'s Certificate, with a <HI>Placet</HI> from my self, and had his
Excellency's Promise of Dispatch, which he performed the next Day, to the
great Admiration of all the <HI>Commis</HI> in the Secretary's Office, that I
being a Stranger could get my Business so soon done, when many General
Officers of the Army had been waiting some Months without Dispatch. Thus I
presently got the Auditor's Place, and had the Consta∣ble's Patent for it;
and when the Constable, upon his own importunate Desire, returned for
<HI>Spain,</HI> I was then garrisoned in the <HI>Fauxburgs</HI> of
<HI>Ghent,</HI> and we had Orders not to beat any Drums, or to make the least
Noise whilst the Constable passed in his Barque.</P>
<P>Upon the Constable's going for <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Count
de Monterrey,</HI> who was <HI>Master de Camp</HI> of a <HI>Spanish</HI>
Regiment, was made Governour <PB N="243" REF="263"/> <HI>pro Interim,</HI> and
was after confirmed Governour General of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI>
where he continued six Years, and was the best Gover∣nour I ever saw in
them. He paid the Soldiers Ten Months in the Year, kept the Country in very
good Order, so that there was no Fear of Robbery; but it cost the Lives of
many Men, and I have seen Fifteen or Sixteen hanging to∣gether upon the
Canal, betwixt <HI>Brussels</HI> and <HI>Willibrook,</HI> for Robberies
committed there.</P>
<P>Not long after Count <HI>Monterrey</HI>'s coming to the
Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Congress was appointed at
<HI>Cologne.</HI> The Plenipotentiaries for our King were Sir <HI>Leoline
Jenkins,</HI> Judge of our Admiralty, and Sir <HI>Joseph Williamson,</HI>
from both which I received Letters to go to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to buy some
Horses and Coaches for them; and I was particularly recommended by them to
Monsieur <HI>Marine,</HI> First Esquire to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
to take his Opinion and Ad∣vice in the Choice of them. I was to buy two Setts
of Eight Horses for each Coach, and the Coaches likewise, if I could get
them good and cheap: After which I was desired to meet them at
<HI>Antwerp,</HI> in their Way to the Congress, which I did according to
their Directions. At their coming to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> they sent me to find
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and Sir <HI>William Lockart,</HI> who were then
with the King of <HI>France,</HI> at a House belonging to the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> Three Miles from <HI>Brussels.</HI> I there found the
aforenamed Persons with the King, who was then marching to besiege
<HI>Maestricht.</HI> <PB N="244" REF="264"/> The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was
made a Lieutenant General in the King's Army, and Sir <HI>William Lockhart</HI>
was our King's Ambassador with the <HI>French</HI> King. At my Return to
the Plenipo∣tentiaries, I waited upon them to <HI>Cologne,</HI> and after came
back to <HI>Brussels,</HI> where I was em∣ployed several times by their
Excellencies, be∣twixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Cologne,</HI> upon great
Occasi∣ons, and was ordered by them to hold a strict Correspondence with
Mr. <HI>Neipho,</HI> who lived then at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and was ordered to
serve our Plenipotentiaries in all he could.</P>
<P>At this time I found the Count <HI>Monterrey</HI> was no Friend
to our Plenipotentiaries, nor indeed to our Master, or his Interest, in any
Case, and was particularly a great Friend to the Capers at <HI>Ostend,</HI>
which Nest of Pyrates did much Hurt to our <HI>English</HI> Merchants,
seizing all <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Ships they could find trading with
<HI>France,</HI> tho' their Trade was freely allowed by the Treaty of 1667,
solemnly ratified by both Crowns: But the Count <HI>Monterrey</HI> would not
allow that Treaty, because he said it was never published in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> which was their own Fault, for the Ratification, not the
Publication, makes all Treaties effectual: And yet our King bore all these
Affronts with incredible Patience, expecting that the Count <HI>Monterrey</HI>
would bet∣ter inform himself, both of the Matters of Fact, and of the Law;
for certainly the Articles of that Treaty were so plain and clear in the
Point, that the Case was adjudged, as soon as compared with the Terms of
the Treaty; and the King <PB N="245" REF="265"/> was still in Hopes, that the
Count would be made sensible of the unsufferable Affront, as well as the
Injustice of such Proceeding of the Privateers was to his Majesty, even
to such a Degree, that his Majesty was thinking of another Way to right his
Subjects, if sudden Reparation came not by fair Means.</P>
<P>Neither was the Count <HI>Monterrey</HI> only re∣fractory in
this, but was highly displeased at my being employed by the
Plenipotentiaries at <HI>Cologne,</HI> and told Father <HI>Patrick</HI> (who
was then called Abbot of <HI>Thuly</HI>) that there was a little
<HI>Englishman</HI> (whose Name he knew not) that was employed by the
Ambassadors at <HI>Cologne,</HI> of which Father <HI>Patrick</HI> gave me
Notice, and said, that, by the Description, he was almost confi∣dent that
his Excellency meant me: And the next Day, as I was going to Dinner, at the
<HI>Great Looking-Glass</HI> in the <HI>Berge Street,</HI> where I lodged, a
Servant told me, there was a Gen∣tleman without that would speak with me.
Whereupon I went out to him, and told him, I was just going to Dinner. He
said, he was Adjutant to his Excellency, and that I must presently go
with him. Upon which I desired his Leave to go into my Chamber, to put on
another Peruke, and that a Coach should be made ready in the mean time, and
so I would go with him. When I came to Court, I met Viscount
<HI>Berlin</HI> (who was then Governour of <HI>Brussels</HI>) in the
Anti-Chamber, who told me his Excellency was in the next Room, and would
speak a Word with me; and thereupon <PB N="246" REF="266"/> led me in to his
Excellency, who asked me three or four Questions before I could answer
him one of them: As, what I did at <HI>Brussels,</HI> why I went so often
to <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>England?</HI> I told him, I was employed by the
<HI>English</HI> Am∣bassadors at <HI>Cologne,</HI> to receive and send
their Letters; and that I should wait upon his Ex∣cellency in few Days, to
get an <HI>Escorte</HI> to carry some things from <HI>England</HI> to the
Pleni∣potentiaries. To which his Excellency replied, That if what I said was
true, <HI>Antwerp</HI> was a fitter Place for me than <HI>Brussels,</HI>
and that he would not permit my longer Stay at <HI>Brussels.</HI> To which
I answered, That there being no open War declared between <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> and so long as I obeyed the Laws of the Coun∣try, it was
lawful for me to stay: And besides, that I was indebted in my Lodging, and
could not go till I had satisfied All. In fine, his Excellency told me,
these were only Excuses which I made, and commanded Viscount
<HI>Berlin,</HI> that the Adjutant should see me go out of Town that Night,
and that <HI>Antwerp</HI> was a much fitter Place for me than
<HI>Brussels</HI>; and so I left his Excellency, and went presently to
Father <HI>Patrick,</HI> who lived near the Court, to inform him of what had
happened, and desired him to send to Mr. <HI>Chaumont</HI> for my Letters,
and open them in my Absence, and then send them to me at Mr.
<HI>Neipho</HI>'s at <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day the Letters came, and one from Sir <HI>Robert
Southwell</HI> to me, giving an Ac∣count of the Peace signed that Day in
Council, <PB N="247" REF="267"/> he being then Clerk of the Council. He told me,
the Writings were scarce dry upon the Council Table; but however, he thought
ne∣cessary to give me a speedy Account of it, for the Information of
others. Father <HI>Patrick</HI> carried this Letter in his Pocket late on
<HI>Satur∣day</HI> Night, and said, he came to give his Ex∣cellency Joy of
the Peace that was made in <HI>England.</HI> His Excellency answered, it was
true that the Peace was made, and that he was very angry with the <HI>Marquis
de Fresno,</HI> who told him, he had been all that Day in Council, and was
so weary, that he could not give him an Ac∣count till the next Post, of all
the Particulars. Whereupon Father <HI>Patrick</HI> said, he would shew him
all the Particulars, which his Excellency was very desirous to see; and
having perused them, he desired to know from whom he had them; and the
Father told him, that Sir <HI>Robert Southwell</HI> had sent them to the
Gentleman he had sent to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> who had given him Leave to open
his Letters in his Absence, and to send them to him. His Excellency
presently said, <HI>I know Sir</HI> Robert Southwell <HI>to be a very
honest Man, and well inclined to us; and if the Gen∣tleman I sent to</HI>
Antwerp <HI>keeps a Correspondence with him, I believe he may be honest
also; and therefore I pray send for him back, and let him bring his little
Horse with him, of whom I have heard great Miracles.</HI> On <HI>Monday</HI>
I came back, and his Excellency sent for Mr. <HI>Chicati</HI> (who was
Master of the Academy at <HI>Brussels</HI>) to ride the Horse round the
Park, and to give him an <PB N="248" REF="268"/> Account of the Horse, who
gave such an Ac∣count of him, that his Excellency would by all Means buy the
Horse of me. I told him, I could not sell him; but if his Excellency would
please to accept of him, with his <HI>English</HI> Equipage, I would
present him; but he refused to have him, unless he might buy him, and
so I saved my Horse and my Honour also. But I must not forget to do
Father <HI>Patrick</HI> this Right, that upon his Excellency's commanding me
from <HI>Brussels,</HI> he forthwith wrote Word of it to the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> and what Danger I did run, by being employed without a
Commission. But whilst I was at <HI>Cologne,</HI> I received this Letter
following from our Ambassadors Plenipotentia∣ries, bearing Date in the
Afternoon of the 12th of <HI>July</HI> 1673.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Upon this emergent Occasion I got to <HI>Antwerp</HI> before
Mr. <HI>Frances,</HI> tho' he parted from <HI>Cologne</HI> in the Morning, and
I did not leave it till late in the Evening, and having shewed him my Letter
from the Ambassadors, and given him all his other Dispatches, I
hastened into <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> after I had taken a Turn into
<HI>Holland,</HI> and visited all Places both by Land and Sea, and from
thence I made a short Step into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> to give the King an
Account of what I had seen, which I put into Writing so fully to his
Majesty's Satisfaction, that he caused my Relation to be entered into the
Council-Book; and having done this, I went to find my Brother <HI>Henry,</HI>
who was very private in <HI>London,</HI> after having had the Misfortune to
kill a <HI>Sussex</HI> Gen∣tleman, his Neighbour, in a Duel (tho' with all
the Fairness and Honour so unfortunate an Accident is capable to have
said for it) and tho' wounded himself, yet he was so severely 
<PB N="250" REF="270"/> prosecuted, that he must leave <HI>England.</HI>
Upon which Occasion, after serious Consideration of his Condition, I
moved my Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> pri∣vately, to get his Majesty's Leave, that
my Brother might go over with me into <HI>Holland,</HI> and I would undertake
to place him where he should give his Lordship constant Accounts of what
passed in those Parts worthy his Know∣ledge, and that by his great
Diligence and In∣dustry should merit his Majesty's Pardon, if not his
Grace and Favour. But, in order to this, I did beg his Lordship, that a
Letter might be written to the Master of the Pacquet-Boat at
<HI>Harwich,</HI> not to let the Boat go off with the Letters till my Arrival,
which should be with all Speed, and that none who came with me might be
questioned, but that we might freely embark: Which being granted to me, I
carried my Brother, where I placed him very well for his Majesty's Service,
which he so punctually performed, that he did not only get the King's Pardon
under the Great Seal, but did his Ma∣jesty such farther Service, that he
was rewarded for it. From <HI>Holland</HI> I went into <HI>Flanders</HI> by the
Way of <HI>Sluys,</HI> and dined with Monsieur <HI>La Leok,</HI> the
Governour, who was Brother to Monsieur <HI>Odybe</HI> of <HI>Zealand.</HI>
From <HI>Flanders</HI> I want to <HI>Brussels,</HI> where I was not many
Days before I received a Patent from the King, to be his Agent at the Court at
<HI>Brussels,</HI> with a civil Letter to the Governour, the <HI>Count de
Monter∣rey,</HI> telling him, that for some particular Reasons he had not
thought fit to send me those Powers <PB N="251" REF="271"/> sooner, which
were antedated some Months be∣fore. Upon this I was very kindly received by
his Excellency, and from that time acknowledged for the King's Minister, the
greatest Cause of which, next to my Diligence in the King's Ser∣vice, I
must attribute to the Letter of Father <HI>Patrick</HI> to my Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> upon my being commanded from <HI>Brussels</HI> by the
<HI>Count de Mon∣terrey,</HI> and at that time acting without a
Com∣mission. But I must not forget, that, at my Return to
<HI>Brussels,</HI> I did disswade Father <HI>Patrick</HI> from going
into <HI>England,</HI> which before he had resolved to do, knowing it would
not only be very prejudicial to the King, but very disadvan∣tageous to the
Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who at that time had many considerable Enemies, and
that no∣thing was moved more strongly against him, than Father
<HI>Patrick</HI>'s lodging at his House in the <HI>Park,</HI> of which my
Lord's Enemies made great Use: But his Lordship was so wise as to
change the Pen for the White Staff, had the Golden Key delivered to him, and
was declared Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Houshold, and Sir
<HI>Joseph Williamson</HI> was forthwith decla∣red, and sworn Secretary
of State in his Place, who sent the several Letters of Complaint, of the
Violences committed upon our Merchants Ships, by the insolent Capers of
<HI>Ostend,</HI> against whom we could never get any Justice done,
du∣ring the Government of the <HI>Count de Monterrey,</HI> who would not own
the Treaty of 1667, which was the Rule we were to go by, in all the Dis∣putes
between the <HI>English</HI> Merchants and the <PB N="252" REF="272"/> Capers,
which Treaty was solemnly ratified by both Crowns. Whereupon I received the
fol∣lowing Letter from Sir <HI>Joseph Williamson,</HI> da∣ted the 21st of
<HI>September</HI> 1674, in these Words following.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bulstrode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is beyond Belief, to see with what intole∣rable
Insolence the Capers of <HI>Ostend</HI> treat all the King's Subjects: The
Treaty of <HI>Madrid</HI> in 1667 must be stood upon, it being express in
the Point; and till the <HI>Count de Monterrey</HI> can have Time to consider
and judge of it himself, 'tis but just he should issue out present
Orders to the Admiralty, not to proceed in any of those Cases, till his
farther Order; and that is the Point you must press immediately at Court,
and get clear and full Proofs of all Wrongs, Injuries, and Threats done, or
given out by them, against any <HI>Englishman,</HI> and demand Satisfaction
of them, and at the same time certify them over hither, that if Justice be
denied there, the King may please to consider what he will farther do; and
continue to press hard for speedy Justice in the Case of all seized
Ships and Goods, and to get the Treaty of 1667 owned as the stand∣ing Rule in
all those Concerns; and be sure to insist, that it hath been allowed in
all Cases amongst us here in our Admiralty, as Sir <HI>Leoline
Jenkins,</HI> Judge of that Court, hath assured me.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>And the 14th of <HI>December</HI> following, I re∣ceived this

<LETTER>
<PB N="253" REF="273"/>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bulstrode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is said now, that our People themselves, either out of
Ignorance or Malice, have given the <HI>Ostenders</HI> great Advantages in
several Cases, by confessing their carrying double Bills of Lading, and
casting Papers overboard, with such like indecent Practices, which in all
Times, and in all Countries, are reputed just Cause of Condemnation, as was
practised in <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars. If this be so,
they may thank themselves if such Cases be given against them. But,
upon the whole Matter, the Proceedings of the Capers should be straitly
watched, and upon what Grounds the Sentences are pretended to be given, that
so the Matter may be received and judged on this Side. In the mean time, it
is manifest, that the King omits nothing that he can possibly and
lawfully do for his Subjects, who are very unjust and ungrateful to his
Majesty, to lay any Part of the Blame upon the King or his Ministers, as I
hear some of them do. It is necessary for you to have an exact List of
all Ships at any time carried up by the <HI>Ostenders,</HI> and I pray try to
get one, with Affidavits of the most notorious of these Capers, for we may
find a Way to meet with them, when they least think of it. I have sent you
an Exemplar of the Trea∣ty of 1667, by which it will appear, how noto∣riously
their Proceedings are against the express Words of the Treaty. What the
Secretary of his Excellency says, <HI>That the Way to prevent all Disputes,
is to have a new Treaty made,</HI> is <PB N="254" REF="274"/> true; but we
insist to have the present Treaty executed: And if any Cases now
arise, where∣in no Provision is yet made, it may not be impro∣per to
propose the having a Rule made for such Cases; but as far as the
present Treaty reaches, That is to be our standing Rule. And as for the
Ship with Plate on board, I see no Reason That should differ the Case,
it coming from <HI>Tangier;</HI> and let the Goods be what they would (not
be∣ing counterband) the Ship being <HI>English</HI> ought to free them: For,
by the Treaty, an <HI>English</HI> Ship is at Liberty to carry all Goods
(even to the Enemies of <HI>Spain,</HI> so they be not counter∣band) and
there is to be no Inquiry into her Lading, all being free, the Ship being
<HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>You are, for the future, to expect Mr. Secre∣tary
<HI>Coventry</HI>'s Orders in all Matters from the King, because you are now
in his District, he having prevailed with his Majesty, that
<HI>Brussels</HI> may be joined to his Province, being under the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Government.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>On the 22d of <HI>January</HI> 1674, I had this following Letter

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bulstrode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Would lose no Time, upon the News of the <HI>Duc de Villa
Hermosa</HI>'s being the assured Successor to <HI>Count de
Monterrey,</HI> to pay him my Compliments; and I beg, Sir, you will do me the
Favour to deliver the inclosed, with the Of∣fers of my humble Service, as one
that has ever had a very particular Value and Honour for the 
<PB N="255" REF="275"/> Person and Merit of the Duke, and in Confor∣mity to
the Joy our Master hath at the Choice; assuring you, that the King hath a
very good Opinion of the Duke; and I hope the King of <HI>Spain</HI> his
Master may have Cause to be glad, by the good Effects it may produce during
his Go∣vernment.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI> wrote to me, That denying the
Treaty of <HI>Flanders</HI> was of so great Concern, having been so long
since ratified, that I should inform my self of the <HI>Count de
Monterrey,</HI> before his Departure for <HI>Spain,</HI> whether he made any
Scruple of owning it; of which I gave Mr. Secretary an Account, that his
Excellency made Difficulty to acknow∣ledge it. Whereupon Mr. Secretary
answered, That he never thought it would have been a Question with the
Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> whether a Treaty of universal Extent, made,
signed, and ratified at <HI>Madrid,</HI> should be com∣plied with in
<HI>Flanders?</HI> For, if <HI>Ostend</HI> was in the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s Dominions, the Treaty reached it. Mr. Secretary, upon this,
sent an Account to our Ambassador in <HI>Spain,</HI> not to in∣treat an
Order, but to expostulate the Matter with that Crown, and the Secretary had
for Answer, That they admired how his Excellen∣cy should make a Question
of observing that Treaty, so nationally ratified as it was: That then they
had sent Orders upon it, which be∣fore they could not have thought
necessary. Count <HI>Monterrey</HI> did then, before his Departure, 
<PB N="256" REF="276"/> send a Letter to our King, to send over Captain
<HI>Berthold</HI> (who was then Prisoner in <HI>England</HI>) to be tryed in
<HI>Flanders</HI>; but his Majesty would not make such a Precedent
against himself, as not to vindicate his Flag's Right against any thing
that should affront it, when he finds them in his own Dominions, and would
give this Answer to <HI>Baron de Bergeyk,</HI> whenever he should demand
it. In the mean time, that what he wrote, was only to inform me of the State of
the Thing, that if it should be dis∣coursed by any of the Ministers, I
might be furnished with Reasons to defend the Proceed∣ings of my Master,
but not as ordered so to do, but as of my self: That the <HI>Count de
Mon∣terrey</HI> was much misinformed in the Matter, the Captain's refusing
to strike being witnessed by the whole Sloop's Crew, both Officers and
Soldi∣ers: That this was done with reproachful Terms, commanding our Captain to
strike in the Name of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> (an Insolence never
com∣mitted before, and against the Peace betwixt the two Crowns) and
pyratically forced away the <HI>English</HI> Ship, being under the King's
Flag, in our own Channel: That this being the Case, and the Offender taken on
the King's Ground (the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI>) there could be no more
Question of the King's Right to try this Man, than if he had come and robbed
in the <HI>Thames:</HI> That I might likewise say, that Captain
<HI>Berthold</HI> and his Comerades have been tryed by a Jury of Twelve Men,
Half of which (according to our Law) were Aliens, and found Guilty, and 
<PB N="257" REF="277"/> have received their Sentence, and have humbly petitioned
the King, for a Release of their Im∣prisonment, to which the King hath
consented, and hath given Order accordingly; and that the Matter of the Flag,
upon the Insult offered to Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> his Majesty's Envoy to the
<HI>Duc de Villa Hermosa,</HI> which Insult was before <HI>Ostend,</HI>
was laid by till the Arrival of <HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</HI> who was daily
expected, his Goods being already come.</P>
<P>About this time I had a Letter from Sir <HI>Joseph
Williamson,</HI> wherein he told me, he was sorry to hear of nothing but
Words in the Business of our Ships: That Provocations were rather daily
renewed, than any Satisfaction given, and even Insults of a higher Nature:
That <HI>Don Francisco Marco de Velasco,</HI> Envoy from the <HI>Duc de
Villa Hermosa</HI> to compliment the King upon his coming to the Government
of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> had taken his Leave, and <HI>Don Pedro de
Ronquillos</HI> was daily expected as Envoy Ex∣traordinary from <HI>Spain,</HI>
who had promised to begin his Business with that of the
<HI>English</HI> Ships carried up by the <HI>Ostenders</HI>; which was
become so clamorous a Cause, that, without some spee∣dy Reparation, no
body knew what would fol∣low. That indeed the Insolence of those Ca∣pers
was intolerable; and not only those, but the <HI>Majorcans</HI> in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> were grown insupportable, by the Number of
Com∣plaints brought daily to the King, for which he had commanded his
Ambassador at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to declare, that if speedy and effectual
Repara∣tion <PB N="258" REF="278"/> were not made, his Majesty could not
lon∣ger withstand the thing, and that it would be impossible to deny
Letters of Reprisal to so many crying Cases of his Subjects that called
for them: That, it happening that the Yacht which carried Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI>
his Majesty's Envoy to return the Compliment of the <HI>Duc de Villa
Hermosa,</HI> coming before <HI>Ostend,</HI> met with a <HI>Spanish</HI>
Man of War, which, according to Custom, he required to strike, and for that
Purpose pierced his Rigging with some Shot; but the Man of War not only
finally refused to strike, but at last gave the Yacht one Gun with a
Bullet in it, which was resented as it ought to be, and put into a legal Way
of ex∣amining first, and would after be proceeded in according to the
ordinary Custom of the Law, as a Crime of a high Misdemeanor, and
con∣stantly punished as such by the Laws of our Kingdom; but because
<HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos</HI> was soon expected at <HI>London,</HI> this
Business would be deferred till his Arrival.</P>
<P>Being informed by a Person of Honour at <HI>Brussels,</HI>
that the <HI>Count de Monterrey</HI> would return into <HI>Spain</HI> by the
Way of <HI>France,</HI> be∣cause his Excellency thought his Presence would
not be acceptable to our King, I did thereupon acquaint Mr. Secretary
<HI>Coventry</HI> with it, who told me, That having acquainted the King with
what I wrote, his Majesty was much surprized, not knowing the Cause for
such a Jealousy: That it was true, the daily Complaints made by his
Subjects, of the ill Treatments they received <PB N="259" REF="279"/> from
<HI>Ostend,</HI> and the small or no Satisfaction that he had received,
notwithstanding the re∣iterated Letters of his Majesty, did much
dis∣please him: But, as to the Person of his Ex∣cellency, the King had no
particular Dissatisfa∣ction; but, on the contrary, if his Excellency
pleased to see <HI>England</HI> in his Return, he needed no way doubt of
receiving Respects suitable to his Quality, and high Employment he had in
<HI>Flanders.</HI> However, the <HI>Count de Monterrey</HI> did not think fit
to pass thro' <HI>England</HI> in his Return, but went thro'
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>September</HI> following, the King wrote a Letter to the
<HI>Duc de Villa Hermosa,</HI> which was sent to me from
<HI>Windsor,</HI> to be delivered, which being faithfully translated from
the <HI>French,</HI> runs thus in <HI>English.</HI></P>

<P>I Have a great Regret to write to you upon the Complaints of

Commerce and Navigation coming from the Ports under Obedience of his Catholick
Majesty. That which I shall at present tell you, is of a double Affront
by two Privateers of <HI>Ostend</HI> (the one commanding a Frigat of Twelve
Guns, with Two Hundred Men, the other of Six Guns, with One Hundred Men)
offered to me as well as my Subjects. A small Ship carrying my Colours, and
having in Convoy a Galliot Merchant belonging to <HI>London,</HI> meeting with
the said two Priva∣teers, about the Height of my Island of
<HI>Guernsey,</HI> <PB N="260" REF="280"/> gave them usual Notice to
strike, which they did not only refuse, but by an unheard of Insolence,
commanded my Ship to strike to them, and to compleat their Outrage, took the
said Merchant, and carried it to <HI>Ostend.</HI> You may well judge, that
this Proceeding is not agreeable to Friends and Allies: And therefore having
represented it to you, I believe you will give your Orders for the
Punishment of these sort of People, as well in this, as in all others of
the like Nature, as my Agent at <HI>Brussels</HI> shall from time to time
in∣form you of, that I may have no Cause to com∣plain farther, but leave my

<P>TO morrow the Earls of <HI>Arlington</HI> and

the Journey gives great Jealou∣sy of a Treaty of Peace, of which there is

Titles, and are purely sent to the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> The Merchants
who have Interest in the Ship St. <HI>George</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> have
made their Complaints to the King and Council, and his Majesty is resolved
to speak roundly about it to the <HI>Baron de Bergeyk,</HI> when he comes:
But in the mean time it will surely be very proper for the Merchants
concerned, that by your Intercession they should have true Copies of the
Proofs and Reason of the Judgment, which cannot in Reason be denied them,
which I will send to the Judge of our Admiralty; and if there be real
Exceptions in Point of Law, Matter of Fact being stated on both Sides, our
Business will go on much more formally, and the King make his Complaints
upon a more so∣lid Ground, than the bare Allegation of the Merchants
interessed, upon whose Complaint the Council would advise nothing
positive, tho' they were very sensible of the Injustice. In the
<HI>Inte∣rim</HI> I am commanded by his Majesty, that you should exhibite
the State of the Case to the Mi∣nisters at <HI>Brussels,</HI> and
demand in his Majesty's Name, that either the Fact be avowed or else
disproved, by letting you see the authentick Do∣cument of the Court; and
the King will, upon a true State of the Matter, consider how to redress
such of his Subjects, as have truly been wronged contrary to the Treaty of
1667: And as for such who by their own Folly, in carrying double Cockets, and
other forbidden Ways, have brought them∣selves into those Streights, they
must be content wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> such

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Very much approve of what my Lord <HI>Mordaunt</HI> and you
told me you were about, and should, if I had been in Town, readily have
joined with you, and, upon the least Notice have come up; for it's certainly
all our Duties, and particularly mine, who have borne such Offices under the 
<PB N="265" REF="285"/> Crown, to improve any Opportunity of a good
Correspondence and Understanding between the Royal Family and the People;
and to leave it impossible for the King to apprehend, that we stand upon
any other Terms that are not as good for him, as necessary for us: Neither
can we fear to be accounted Undertakers at the next Meeting of Parliament; for
I hope it shall never be thought unfit for any Number of Lords to give the
King privately their Opinion, when asked, which in former Days, thro' all the
Northern Kingdoms, nothing of great Moment was acted by their Kings, without
the Advice of the most considerable and active Nobility, that were within
Distance, tho' they were not of the ordinary Privy-Council; such
Occasions being not always of that Nature as did require the Assembling
the great Council, or Parliament. Besides, there are none so likely as us,
nor Time so proper as now, to give the only Advice I know truly serviceable
to the King, affectionate to the Duke, and secure to the Country (which is a
new Parliament) which I do undertake at any time to convince your Lordship,
is the clear Interest of all them. But, in the mean time, I must beg yours
and my Lord <HI>Mordaunt</HI>'s Pardon, that I come not up as I intended, for I
hear from all Quarters, of Letters from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that do give
Notice, that I am coming up to Town, that a great Office with a strange Name
is preparing for me, and such like. I am ashamed I was thought so easy
a Fool by those who should know me better: But I assure your
Lordship, there's no Place or Con∣dition <PB N="266" REF="286"/> will invite
me to Court, during this Par∣liament, nor until I see the King thinketh
fre∣quent Parliaments as much his Interest, as they are the People's Right:
For until then, I can neither serve the King as I could, nor think a great
Place safe enough for a second Adventure. When our great Men have tried a
little longer, they will be of my Mind; in the mean time, no kind of Usage
shall put me out of that Duty and Respect I owe to the King and Duke: But I
think it would not be amiss, for the Men that are in great Offices, who are
at Ease, and where they would be, to be ordinarily civil to a Man in my
Condition, since, they may be assured, that all their great Places put
together shall not buy me from my Principles. My Lord, I beseech you to
impart this to the Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> my Lord of
<HI>Falconbridge,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Hollis;</HI> and when you four command
me up, I will obey. I am sorry my Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> had no better
Success in his Summer's Negotiation, and that his Uncle Sir <HI>William</HI>
could make no nearer Approach to the Ministers of State, than the Kissing

<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bulstrode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Understand that <HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</HI> and the
<HI>Sieur Decio,</HI> are come in Commission to <HI>Ostend,</HI> and have
made Bargains with some particular Merchants, by way of Composition (tho'
nothing concluded with his Majesty as to Right) but these very Bargains and
Contracts made with them by <HI>Don Pedro</HI> and <HI>Decio,</HI> who is a
Burgher of <HI>Ostend,</HI> are neither respected nor regarded; and if
these Affronts are done and maintained by Order from the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> we must look upon it as a Violation of the Treaty: But if it
be done by Particulars that will not give Obedience to his Catholick Majesty,
nor Sa∣tisfaction to us, I hope we shall not be blamed, if we right our
selves by Reprisals, allowed by the Treaty against such, as both in
Contempt of our King and their own, do impudently continue their Insolences.
Sir, I pray you to assure his Excellency, that I have done my utmost to
com∣pose these Differences, but the no Satisfaction received, and the many
Insolences since done, maketh it impossible to suffer any much longer
Delay. The Parliament now approaches, and when the oppressed Merchants
shall there tell their Story, I know what Reproaches will be uttered
against those Ministers that have not been quicker in giving Remedies to
these Vio∣lences. I am sorry, Sir, I can give you no other Answer upon
this Matter; but without speedy Reparation, Reprisals cannot be

</LETTER>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1675, the two Houses were in a great Heat
with each other; whereupon, the Ninth of that Month, the Black Rod knocked at
the Door of the House of Commons, and said, the King commanded them to wait
upon him presently in the House of Lords. The King then told them, That he
had called them <PB N="270" REF="290"/> together, to secure their Religion and
Proper∣ties, which he hoped they would have done successfully, seeing he
had not offered any Bu∣siness of his own to hinder or obstruct it, and
had let them sit longer than he intended at first: That he designed only
to have adjourned them for a short Time; but finding some of his and their
Enemies had been able to make Differen∣ces between them, which could not be
accom∣modated by any thing less than a Prorogation, he very unwillingly
prorogued them to the 13th of <HI>October,</HI> when he hoped to meet them
again in a better Temper, without springing new Differences, or reviving the
old. The Members then posted down into their several Countries,
dissatisfied enough, but with whom, or with what, they could not tell. They
all agreed, the King did no more than Necessity required him to do, and
some believed he had not done so much as he ought to have done, or must
quickly do; for, that a Prorogation was not likely to do the Business, but
that the Par∣liament must be dissolved, for that no Good could be
expected from them, and that it was lost Labour to try them longer. After
this Prorogation, the Marquess of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and the Earl of
<HI>Shaftsbury</HI> appeared at Court, which was done by Permission; for
the King being asked, if he would not take it ill, if they came, his
Majesty's Answer was, That he forbid no Body, without any farther
Encouragement. It seems the Two before-mentioned went likewise to St.
<HI>James</HI>'s, and were at the Duke's Rising, <PB N="271" REF="291"/> and
were received very kindly by his Royal Highness, which gave new Occasion of
Talk, and that the latter of them two would come soon into Play. The
Parliament being again farther prorogued, and afterwards assembling, the
Lords were very hot upon the Point of the Legality of that Parliament; and tho'
those that opposed were so few, that it was not worth being put to the
Question, yet it lasted a long Debate, and when the Debate was over, it was
moved, that those who first stirred the Scruple should be punished;
and then how many should be accounted liable? Whether the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> who first moved it, or others with him? And how many,
and who? Upon which three others were named, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earls of
<HI>Salisbury</HI> and <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> and Lord <HI>Wharton:</HI> And a
Debate arose, whether those Lords should withdraw as criminal, till their
Punishment was agreed upon? The Question being put, Whether the offending
Lords should withdraw? it was carried in the Affirmative. Then the House
called for the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who was gone; upon which it was
ordered, that the Black Rod should take his Grace into Custody, and bring
him to the House the next Day. Then the other Three were called, and
requi∣red to ask Pardon of the King and the House, which they refused,
and were thereupon sent Prisoners to the <HI>Tower.</HI> The Duke of
<HI>Buck∣ingham</HI> appeared the next Day, and was sent Prisoner to the
<HI>Tower,</HI> because he refused like∣wise to make the
Acknowledgment.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="292"/><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 29th of
<HI>February,</HI> the Peti∣tion of the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was read in
the House, submitting to what the Lords should enjoin him, in begging
Pardon of the King and their Lordships. Whereupon the Lord Chan∣cellor told
the House, That the King had also received a Petition from the said Earl;
but un∣derstanding, that he endeavoured to free him∣self from their
Censure, by an Appeal to the King's Bench, during the Adjournment of
Par∣liament, his Majesty thought not fit to declare his Pleasure, as to his
Enlargement, till the House of Lords had taken the Case into their
Consideration. Upon which, after a long De∣bate, it was ordered, That the
Records of the King's Bench Court should be brought into the House, and the
Earl's Business proceeded upon the next Day; when the Lords declared, That
it was a Breach of Privilege for any of their House to appeal to an inferior
Court, during the Sitting of Parliament: That however, this should not be any
Bar to any Plea the Earl should make. However, it seems that, some Time
after, the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> moved again by his Council in the King's
Bench, for ano∣ther <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI>; upon which his Lordship was
brought thither, and the Business was agreed by Council on both Sides, and
the Judges de∣clared, that his Lordship being committed by a superior
Court, <HI>viz.</HI> the House of Lords, of which his Lordship was a
Member, they could not enquire into the Legality or Illegality of his
Commitment, nor could they give him any <PB N="273" REF="293"/> Relief, and so
remanded his Lordship back to the <HI>Tower.</HI> Upon this the Earl
petitioned the House of Lords, to know whether he should be released or
not? To which the Lords told him, considering he had added a new Offence to
that for which he was committed, much more heinous than the first, in
applying himself to the King's Bench with a new <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> which
was a farther Contempt of the Authority of the House of Lords, they would not
release him. To which his Lordship answered, That the Crime for which he
was committed, was the only Matter in Question before them; and there∣fore,
if they looked upon his Submission as Satisfaction enough for the Fault he
had com∣mitted, he might be allowed by the House to make his Application to
the King, for his Liber∣ty; but, after a long Debate, it was carried in the
Negative, That he should not be allowed by the House to make his
Application to the King, and that they were resolved not to release him,
till they had examined all his Faults together. Then the Lords resolved to
have the Earl once more before them, and having perused the Record of his
second <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> they agreed, that his applying again to an
inferior Court, in the time of an Adjournment, which is a virtual Session
of Parliament, to be relieved against the Judgment of the House of Lords,
was a Breach of their Privileges, and resolved, That he should answer the
Crime at the Bar of their House, the next Day; but the other Crime, far which
he was committed, seemed to be for∣given. <PB N="274" REF="294"/> In the End,
the Earl finding his Peti∣tion to the Lords rejected there, for want of having
behaved himself with due Submission and Obedience to the King, did then
again pe∣tition his Majesty; but either uncarefully, or too capriciously
insinuated in his Petition, that he did it by Order of the House of Lords,
which the King took ill, and refused the Petition upon it. After this, the
Lords were again upon this Business, and after many refined Questions,
the whole Matter hung upon some Words which were alledged his Lordship
should have said at the King's Bench Bar, upon his bringing his last
<HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and that the Words then spoken by his Lordship were
derogatory to the House of Lords, and to their Power: Whereupon
Wit∣nesses were called in and heard, who proved so little to the Earl's
Disadvantage, that he was at length called for, to make his Submission to
the House, which his Lordship did with all the Words and Ceremonies exacted
of him, so much to the Satisfaction of the House, that they or∣dered an
Address to be made to the King, to signify to his Majesty, that they (the
House of Lords) were entirely satisfied, and that the whole Business of
his Lordship's Enlargement, or farther Confinement, rested with his
Maje∣sty: Upon which his Lordship was that Night remanded to the
<HI>Tower.</HI> The next Morning, the White Staves of the Lords House, in the
Name of the whole House, made an Address to his Majesty, in the Case of
the Earl of <HI>Shafts∣bury</HI>; and the Lord Treasurer, the Morning 
<PB N="275" REF="295"/> following, made Report to the House, that his
Majesty was satisfied, and that he would gra∣ciously please to order,
that the said Earl should be delivered from the <HI>Tower,</HI> which was
done accordingly; and the next Day the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had his
Liberty, and took his Place in the House of Lords.</P>
<P>About this time I received a Letter from the King to the <HI>Duc
de Villa Hermosa,</HI> brought me from <HI>Windsor</HI> by Mr.
<HI>Puckle,</HI> who was then employed by the Merchants. That it being long
since the Merchants first applied them∣selves to his Majesty for
Redress in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the King having long expected, from the
Interposition of himself in that Affair, and the several Memorials given
in his Name to the Mi∣nisters of <HI>Spain,</HI> from time to time
residing, as also by his Minister at <HI>Brussels,</HI> that his
Sub∣jects would sooner have found the good Effects of their Instances; but
especially being so seri∣ously promised, upon the coming of their
De∣puties, with <HI>Sieur Decio</HI> their Fiscal, all Dif∣ferences would be
speedily adjusted: Yet, to his great Dissatisfaction he found, that
several Months had been taken up by them in Confe∣rences, and yet the Affair
appeared so far from being ended, that it seemed to be industriously
protracted: And his Subjects therefore freshly importuning him with
reiterated Complaints of their Oppressions, and imploring that he would
provide for their Satisfaction, by such Ways as were agreeable to his royal
Dignity: His Maje∣sty therefore calling to Mind with what Pa∣tience 
<PB N="276" REF="296"/> he had waited for Reparation of their Damages, and
having used all amicable Ways depending upon him, was now constrained to
let his Excellency know, That if Justice were not speedily administred to
his Subjects, he should be obliged by the Protection he owes them, to give
them Leave to take their Satisfaction, by such Ways as the Law of Nations,
and his Treaty of 1667 with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> allowed. And therefore
the King seriously desired his Ex∣cellency to give effectual Orders to
those con∣cerned, that what had been wrongfully done or taken from his
Majesty's Subjects, by the Privateers of <HI>Ostend,</HI> might be adjudged
and re∣stored to them, or their Value; that thereby the Necessity of
having Recourse to severer Remedies might be prevented, which his Majesty
promised himself from his Love to Justice, and his great Desire to
preserve a good Friendship and Corre∣spondence betwixt the two Crowns.
'Tis true indeed we had better Orders from the Duke, than we had formerly from
the Count <HI>Monter∣rey</HI>; but the Difference was, that the <HI>Count de
Monterrey</HI> would always have his Orders pun∣ctually obeyed, and the Orders
of the <HI>Duc de Villa Hermosa</HI> were seldom complied with; so that
his Majesty's Subjects were very little the better for all the good Orders of
the <HI>Duc de Villa Hermosa.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after this, I received a Letter from the King to the
<HI>Duc de Villa Hermosa,</HI> which being faithfully translated, run
thus.</P>

<SALUTE>Cousin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Desire I have always had, and have, to do and perform
all things on my Part, that may effectually conduce to the constant
maintaining of a perfect Amity between me and my good Brother the Catholick
King; and the Care which you have also used on your Part, to the same
good Purpose, ever since you came to the Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI>
made me believe, that my Subjects might have exercised their Commerce and
Navigation, without any Hinde∣rance or Interruption from those of his
Catholick Majesty; and the rather, because you once sent the Sieur
<HI>Decio,</HI> Fiscal of <HI>Ostend,</HI> hither into <HI>England,</HI> to
adjust such Matters as were then in Difference, and to prevent the like for
the future: Notwithstanding which, I am informed, that a Difficulty is
raised concerning the Liberty of Trade to my Subjects, from one Port to
another, of such Countries as are in Enmity with <HI>Spain,</HI> but in Peace
and Amity with <HI>England,</HI> tho' there be not the least Ground or Shadow
of any such Exception between me and his Catholick Majesty, nor is the like
practised or pretended by any other Nation in Amity with me. Yet the
Admiralty of <HI>Ostend</HI> refuseth to allow my Subjects that Liberty,
upon a Pretence that the said Fiscal, when he was lately here, had given
undeniable Arguments in that Behalf: But I am well infor∣med, that, when the
said Fiscal was here, and presented this Objection with some others
against the Liberty of Trade, Sir <HI>Leoline Jenkins,</HI> Judge 
<PB N="278" REF="298"/> of my Admiralty, and Sir <HI>Robert Southwell,</HI>
Knights, being appointed to examine the Fiscal's Papers, did make Answer
thereto in Writing, in the Month of <HI>July</HI> 1675, and in particular to
that very Point, touching the Right of Freedom in Trade from one Port to
another; and that never any Answer or Reply being made thereunto, it was
believed that the said Fiscal, and all those concerned in that
Question, had finally acquies∣ced therein. A Copy of the Answer made by
the said two Knights to the Fiscal's Objection, I have caused to be
transmitted to my Resident at <HI>Brussels,</HI> and commanded him to
impart the same unto you, not doubting but the Arguments there∣in contained
will appear to you so strongly groun∣ded upon Treaties and Reason, that I
shall not need to press you for Justice in so clear a Case; but that
that you will, of your own Accord and free Motion, adjust and finally
determine this Point, according to the Rules set down in the aforesaid
Treaty of 1667, between me and his Catholick Majesty, so as my Subjects may
receive no farther Interruption in the lawful Exercise of their Freedom in
Trade and Navigation, which is the only Intent of this my Letter to you, with
the Assurance whereof I remain,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>About this time Letters from the <HI>Hague</HI> told us, that
the States General and their Confede∣rates had accepted of <HI>Nimmeguen</HI>
for the Place <PB N="279" REF="299"/> of Treaty, at the Mediation and
Recommen∣dation of his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which was forthwith
communicated to <HI>Monsieur de Ravigni,</HI> the <HI>French</HI>
Ambassador, who told our King, that his most Christian Majesty would
not send his Ambassadors, till the Emperor had agreed to some
Accommodation upon the two preliminary Points, of Prince <HI>William</HI> of
<HI>Fur∣stenberg,</HI> and the Money belonging to the <HI>French</HI> King
seized at <HI>Cologne.</HI> Hereupon our King sent to his Ambassador at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> to press the States in that Matter, who answered, That
they did not think fit to meddle in that Matter, but left it entirely to the
Emperor's Pleasure, whose Minister at the <HI>Hague</HI> declared in the
Name of the Emperor, That his Imperial Ma∣jesty was willing to suspend
the Process against the Prince, and would agree, that in the Assem∣bly
at <HI>Nimmeguen,</HI> Consideration should be had of that Prince's
Detention, and of seizing the Money at <HI>Cologne</HI>; but that the Prince
being a natural born Subject of the Emperor, he could not admit to put him into
a third Hand; upon which the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the States were
satisfied.</P>
<P>In the Year 1675, I had Notice given me by Mr. Secretary
<HI>Coventry,</HI> That the King was re∣solved I should follow the Camp,
and had or∣dained an Allowance of 400 <HI>L. Sterling</HI> for my Equipage:
That I should be careful to write all that passed in the Army, and leave
some Person at <HI>Brussels</HI> to write all from thence, as fully as
I used to do: That the Continuance of my Di∣ligence <PB N="280" REF="300"/>
and Exactness was the Way to have my Pains valued, which would at last
bring a good Recompence with it.</P>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> 1677, I was advised by Mr. Secre∣tary
<HI>Coventry,</HI> that <HI>Mynheer van Benningham,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Envoy, had told him, that, in Dis∣course with <HI>Count de Basigni,</HI>
a Lieutenant Ge∣neral of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops, I had told him at
<HI>Brussels,</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had raised his
Siege of <HI>Charleroy</HI> without fighting, to make himself King of his own
Country, with many other things very prejudicial to the Honour and Trust of
the Prince; which being known to the King and Duke, they were much concerned at
it: And that it would therefore become me pre∣sently to apply my self to
Count <HI>Basigni,</HI> to get a Certificate from him, that I had said no
such thing to him. The same Story was also told me by Mr. <HI>Laury
Hyde,</HI> who was newly arrived from the <HI>English</HI> Court. Upon
these In∣formations, I went forthwith to Count <HI>Basigni,</HI> and
shewed him Mr. Secretary's Letter, which was wrote by Order from the King.
Where∣upon <HI>Count de Basigni</HI> told me, I had always been esteemed a
<HI>Frenchman,</HI> and that I had a great Inclination for that Nation: That he
had endeavoured to do me that Right, as to assure the contrary, by
saying, I was unsatisfied at the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s raising his
Siege of <HI>Charleroy</HI> without fighting, which he had purposely done, to
make himself King of <HI>Holland</HI> and the Low Countries. I then asked
him, whether he had ever heard me say any such thing? He then 
<PB N="281" REF="301"/> confessed he never heard me say so, but that
what he had said was in my Justification, and that I was not the Man that
others apprehended me to be: That I might make a good Excuse to the
Secretary, by saying, <HI>Count de Basigni</HI> not being well, was gone to
drink the <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters, and that at his Return I would get such a
Cer∣tificate from him as was required: That in the mean time the Business
would be forgotten, and I should hear no more of it. But I told him plainly,
that since his Tongue had been too long, in speaking that, as from me,
which I never said, whereby my Honour was in great Hazard, his Hand was not
too short to give me Satisfaction by his Pen; which if he refused, he
must do it with his Sword, and that my Coach was at his Door, and that I
would carry him out of the Ramparts, and the Business would quickly be
decided. To which he an∣swered, he would much more willingly give me
Satisfaction with his Sword, than with his Pen, after he had heard Mass at
the <HI>Domini∣cans.</HI> Upon which I left him, and went to the
<HI>Dominicans</HI>; soon after which, the Count came thither, and when the
Mass was ended, we went out together to my Coach, and putting him before me,
as I was going in after him, <HI>Don Antonio de Lera,</HI> and <HI>Don Martin
de les Ries,</HI> two <HI>Spanish</HI> Officers, stopp'd me, and said we
should not go together, for that they knew there was a Quarrel betwixt us,
and that they would secure and take <HI>Count de Basigni</HI> Priso∣ner
from me, and would forthwith give Notice <PB N="282" REF="302"/> of it to the
Governour, Viscount <HI>Berling:</HI> Whereupon I went into my Coach, and
sent immediately to Mr. <HI>Lent,</HI> who was Resident for the King of
<HI>Denmark.</HI> He came presently to me, to whom I told all that happened:
Where∣upon he offered me his Service, and said he would stand by me, and
serve me in all I should desire of him. Soon after Viscount
<HI>Berlin</HI> came to me, to let me know, that he would endeavour to
compose the Difference amicably between Count <HI>Basigni</HI> and me, in
the Absence of the <HI>Duc de Villa Hermosa,</HI> and that he had secured
Count <HI>Basigni</HI> in his own House, but durst not meddle with me,
because I was a publick Minister; but desired I would not stir abroad,
and that he hoped to compose the Dif∣ference friendly between us. I sent
forthwith to Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> to desire him to take my Coach to <HI>Bruin
le Comte,</HI> to see the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and to make my Excuse
for not waiting upon his Highness, till I had freed my self from the
Imputation that was cast upon me. I had not been long at Home, but <HI>Count
de Tanuti,</HI> the Pope's Internuncio, accompanied with the Ab∣bot of
<HI>Leyde,</HI> came to see me, and offered their Service for accommodating
the Business between us. The Internuncio told me, and so did the Abbot of
<HI>Leyde,</HI> that they could not advise <HI>Count de Basigni</HI> to
give me such a Certificate as I desired, for that would be to give
himself the Lye; but I told them, he must either do that, or fight with me,
and that I had rather lose my Life than my Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="303"/>In the Afternoon of the same Day, Mr.
<HI>Ly∣seca,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who was Superintendant in the Place
of <HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</HI> came to see me: Amongst other things,
he told me, that perchance he might do me some Service, because, by virtue
of his Office, he could examine upon Oath, any Person that was Prisoner
upon such an Occasion; and that if I would let him know what Questions he
should ask him, he would not fail to do it; and that he would take a
<HI>Commis</HI> with him, who should put in Writing all that was said, of
which he would give me a Copy attested under his Hand and Seal. Upon this I
told him, that he would please to examine Count <HI>Basigni,</HI> how he
came to be a Prisoner? and if there was a Quarrel betwixt us? and upon what
Account? And that, whether he had heard me at any time, especially since
the Siege of <HI>Charleroy,</HI> speak any thing against the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> that might reflect upon his Honour, or Trust reposed in
him by the States General of the United Provinces? and that he, the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> did not fight then, be∣cause he would make himself King of
that Coun∣try? To which Count <HI>Basigni</HI> answered upon Oath, That he
never heard me speak any thing tending to the Dishonour of the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> or breaking of his Trust to the States General; because,
if he had heard any such thing, he would have questioned me for it. When
Mr. <HI>Lyseca</HI> gave me this Account the next Day, I told him, I should
be very well satisfied, if he would give me three Certificates signed by 
<PB N="284" REF="304"/> himself and his <HI>Commis,</HI> signifying what he
had told me; the one should be for the King and the Duke, the second for
the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the third to be left in the Stadt-House at
<HI>Brussels, in perpetuam rei memoriam,</HI> which was done accordingly,
and all our Differences were amicably composed. The King my Master, with
his Royal Highness, were entirely satisfied with my Proceeding and Conduct
in this Busi∣ness, as Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI> wrote me Word, and
the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was fully satisfied, as Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
informed me, and as I understood afterwards from the Prince himself. But
this Affair stuck upon <HI>Count de Basigni,</HI> as an ill Mark upon him,
who lived not many Years after it.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> 1677, the House of Commons re∣solved, that
those Persons who either advised, compelled, assisted, or
encouraged the raising, levying, or sending his Majesty's Subjects into
the military Service of the <HI>French</HI> King, since the King's
Proclamation to the contrary, are, and shall be esteemed Enemies to the
Safety of the Kingdom. Then they agreed to present an Address to his

Majesty's Kingdoms, by the Growth and Power of the <HI>French</HI> King,
especi∣ally by the Acquisitions already, and the farther Progress likely
to be made by him in the <HI>Spanish Netherlands;</HI> in the Preservation
and Security whereof we humbly conceive the Interest of Your Majesty, and
the Safety of Your People, are singly concerned: And therefore we most
humbly beseech Your Majesty to take the same into Your Royal
Consideration, and to strengthen Your self with such stricter
Alliances as may secure Your Majesty, and preserve and secure the
said <HI>Nether∣lands,</HI> and thereby quiet the Minds of Your Ma∣jesty's
People.</P>

<P>The King's Answer to this Address was to this Effect. That
his Majesty was of Opinion, that the Conservation of <HI>Flanders</HI> was
of great Importance to <HI>England:</HI> That he would use all Means in his
Power for the Preservation of <HI>Flanders,</HI> as could consist with
the Safety of the Kingdom. And the 11th of <HI>April</HI> 1677, his Majesty
sent this Message to the House of Commons.</P>
<Q><PB N="287" REF="307"/>HIS Majesty having considered your
late Address, and finding some Alterations in Affairs abroad, thinks it
necessary to put you in Mind, that the only Way to prevent the Dangers that
may arise to these Kingdoms, must be by putting his Majesty timely in a
Condition to make such fitting Preparations as may enable him to do what
shall be most for the Security of them.</Q>

<P>THAT the Thanks of this House be given to his

they had provided a Security of 200000<HI>l.</HI> and that what∣soever of the

<P>The 16th of this Month, his Majesty sent for the House of

him Credit for, was not sufficient for making the necessary Preparations;
and there∣fore demanded Six Hundred Thousand Pounds <PB N="288" REF="308"/>
more; but the House desired his Majesty, he would give them Leave to
defer that Matter, till they came together again, for that their House was at
present very empty; and the 22d of <HI>May</HI> 1677, his Majesty sent a
Message to the House of Commons, to attend him presently in the
<HI>Banqueting-House,</HI> where he made a Speech to them, and they being
returned, went into a grand Committee of the whole House, to consider of
his Majesty's Speech, and resolved, That an Humble Address be presented

Reasons why they could not comply with his Majesty's Speech, till such

Necessity of such spee∣dy Alliances; and that when such Alliances
were made, to give his Majesty Assurances of speedy and chearful

<P><HI>May</HI> the 21st, the Address of the House of Commons
was read and agreed to, and the Privy-Counsellours of the House were
ordered to know his Majesty's Pleasure when the House should wait upon
him with it. The 26th of <HI>May</HI> they attended the King in the
<HI>Banqueting-House</HI> with their Address. The King told them, it was of
great Weight, that he would take it into Consideration, and return them an
Answer. The 28th of <HI>May</HI> he sent for the House of Com∣mons into
the <HI>Banqueting-House</HI> at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and gave them this
following Answer. That he could by no means approve of their last
Ad∣dress, for that it contained many things unfit for them to meddle with,
and which intrenched upon the undoubted Right of the Crown, whose Prerogative
it was to make Peace, and declare War: That his Majesty would never suffer
to <PB N="290" REF="310"/> be lessened so essential a Part of the
Monarchy: But withal his Majesty declared, that as he had done all that lay
in his Power, so he would continue to apply himself by all the Means he
could, to let the World see his Care both for the Security and Satisfaction
of his People, tho' it might not be with those Advantages to them, which by
their Assistance he might have procured.</P>
<P>But I must not forget to tell, that in this Year 1677, the
House of Commons agreed up∣on an Address to his Majesty, to return him
their humble Thanks for expressing his great Care of the Protestant
Religion, in marrying his Niece to a Protestant Prince, and did humbly
beseech his Majesty to admit of no Treaty of Peace, but such a one as
leaves the <HI>French</HI> King in no better State or Condition to offend his
Neighbours, than he is left by the Treaty of the <HI>Pyrrbeneans.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1678, the two Houses of Parliament met, and
the King being in his Robes in the Lords House, sent for the House of
Commons to confirm their new Speaker, Sir <HI>Robert Sawyer</HI>; after which
the Lord Chief Justice <HI>North</HI> (the Lord Chancellor being
indisposed) acquainted the two Houses, That his Majesty hoped he
should have been able at their Meeting to have told something to their full
Satisfaction, but that things were not yet in that Condition, by reason the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassador was not fully au∣thorized to treat an Alliance,
which might com∣prehend all the Allies, and particularly to en∣gage, 
<PB N="291" REF="311"/> that the States General should, in like manner as is
done in <HI>England,</HI> prohibite all Trade with <HI>France</HI>; and
therefore his Majesty had thought fit, that they should adjourn for some
short time longer, when his Majesty hoped he should be able to tell them
the Certainty of things, upon which they might take the Reso∣lutions that
were fit: Upon which both Hou∣ses of Parliament adjourned themselves.</P>
<P>About this time I received a Letter from Sir <HI>Joseph
Williamson,</HI> in these Words.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE bear nothing yet of the great Business of our
<HI>East India</HI> Company so long since promised, which is not yet
ended, nor like to be; the Commissioners can come to no Agreement in their
Differences, each Company being obsti∣nate in their Demands. All that is like
to be done is this, to leave Matters in the same State they were before the
Negotiation, and a Rule is made for the amicable Decision of all Complaints,
which is this that follows. If Justice be not done, or Satisfaction given to
the Parties by the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or the <HI>States
General,</HI> respectively, in Three Months, then within Three Months after,
Four Commissioners shall be named on each Side, who shall be obliged to
determine it in Three Months following their Assembly; and if they do not,
they shall name an Arbitra∣tor, to decide within Six Months: And if he do
not, and the Commissioners cannot agree upon such an Arbitrator, then the
Cause to devolve <PB N="292" REF="312"/> upon the King of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> to decide; and this to be the Method.
Upon each Complaint, the Commissioners in the first Case to meet at
<HI>London,</HI> and in the second at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and so
alternatively; and an Act is passed between the King and the
<HI>States,</HI> That the 9th Article of the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> which
relates to this Matter of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> and the Treaty Marine, be
executed, and no farther Proceedings to be had upon it: Upon which the Deputies
of the <HI>East India</HI> Company are parted, as likewise the
Commissioners for <HI>Surinam,</HI> the States of <HI>Zealand</HI> having
some Weeks past sent their Orders directly to <HI>Surinam,</HI> for
executing that Part of the Treaty, and bringing off the <HI>English</HI> from
thence.</P>

<P><PB N="293" REF="313"/>This was in the Year 1678 that Sir
<HI>Joseph Williamson</HI> resigned, and the Earl of <HI>Sunder∣land</HI>
came in his Place.</P>
<P>The 22d of <HI>April</HI> 1678, all People were impatiently
expecting what Resolution would be taken in <HI>Holland</HI> upon the
Proposals of the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors, which it seems the States
were inclined to accept, at a Time when his Majesty was so vigorously
preparing for the War, and was so near engaging in it, that it was believed,
by the latter End of the next Month, his Royal Highness would be in
<HI>Flan∣ders</HI> with the whole Army, if no extraordinary Accident hinder'd
it.</P>
<P>But on the 6th of <HI>May</HI> 1678, after a long Debate, the

Treaty with <HI>Holland,</HI> as not consisting with the Safety of the
Kingdom: Secondly, that his Majesty will please to enter into an Alliance
with the Em∣peror, <HI>Spain,</HI> (and the States General, if they will come
into it, if not, to proceed without them) and other the Confederates for

<P>The 14th of <HI>May</HI> his Majesty sent a Message to
the House of Commons, to let them know, that unless they did farther
supply his Majesty, he should be forced to disband all his Forces, and
to cease his Preparations for Sea; and in the Afternoon of that Day, the
House of Com∣mons presented their Address, to which the King was
pleased to answer the next Day, That their Address was so extravagant,
that his Ma∣jesty did not think fit to give it the Answer it deserved,
and the next Day the King prorogued the Parliament to the 23d of <HI>May</HI>
1678. The 31st of <HI>May</HI> the House of Commons ordered the Members of
the Privy Council, to pray his Majesty, that if he will please to enter
into a War against the <HI>French</HI> King, they would sup∣port him in it;
if otherwise, they would pro∣ceed to provide for paying and disbanding the
Army: To which his Majesty was pleased the next Day to answer, That the
<HI>French</HI> King had consented to a Cessation to the 27th of
<HI>July,</HI> which his Majesty believed would be followed by a general
Peace; but that the King thought it necessary to keep up his Army till that
time, and therefore called upon them forthwith to provide a Subsistence for
them; Whereupon the <PB N="295" REF="315"/> House resolved, that all the
Forces raised since the 29th of <HI>September</HI> last, be forthwith
paid and disbanded, except those Forces that were sent to the
Plantations; and they resolved, That a Supply be granted to his Majesty,
towards the paying and disbanding the Forces that have been raised since
the said 29th of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> 1678 several Persons were ap∣prehended
for High Treason, and were exa∣mined before the Lords of the Privy Council,
and committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> in order to their Tryal; and all that were,
or suspected to be <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, were seized upon, and the
House of Commons passed this following Vote, That, upon the Evidence that
had already ap∣peared to them, there is, and hath been, a damnable hellish
Plot contrived and carried on by the Popish Recusants, for
assassinating and murdering the King, and for subverting the
Government, and destroying the Protestant Religion by Law established;
and ordered, that this Vote be communicated to the Lords at a Conference, and
that the Lords be then desired to join with the House of Commons, in
providing Remedies for the Safety of his Ma∣jesty's sacred Person and
Government, and Protestant Religion by Law established. His Majesty was
then pleased to issue out his Pro∣clamation, requiring all Popish
Recusants not to go five Miles from the Places of their Abode, and command
all of them to quit the City of <HI>London,</HI> without Exception of any
Person, but only foreign Ministers; and his Majesty <PB N="296" REF="316"/> sent an Answer in Writing by one of his prin∣cipal Secretaries
to the Address for tendering the Oaths to all Persons residing in
<HI>Whitehall, St. James</HI>'s, and <HI>Somerset-House,</HI> except the
menial Servants of the Queen and Dutchess, who are excepted by Articles of
Marriage.</P>
<P>Upon the 4th of <HI>August</HI> 1679, the King was taken at
<HI>Windsor</HI> with an Indisposition something like an Ague,
occasioned by a Cold, which made him very heavy, and took away his Stomach:
The News thereof being brought to the Duke at <HI>Brussels,</HI> his Royal
Highness sent for me at Ten at Night, and then he ac∣quainted me with his
Intention of going early the next Morning for <HI>England,</HI> and commanded
me to make his Excuse to the <HI>Duc de Villa Hermosa,</HI> for not taking
Leave of his Excel∣lency, his going being so sudden, private, and
unexpected. The 5th of <HI>September</HI> following I had Letters from
<HI>England,</HI> that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was safely arrived at
<HI>Windsor,</HI> and was most kindly received by the King and all the
Court: That many Persons flocked thither to see the Duke, and kiss his
Hands; and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> were resolved to
come in a Body, to pay their Respects to his Royal Highness.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI> wrote me Word,
That he had received an Express from <HI>Spain,</HI> which he had long
expected: That he did believe that Court would not be so quick in declaring a
Rupture, as some of their Mini∣sters in <HI>England</HI> had been, in both
threatning <PB N="297" REF="317"/> and advising it: That I might assure
the <HI>Count de Fuentes,</HI> that our Master was never wanting in the
courteous receiving any publick Mini∣ster, much less one of his Character,
and sent from so great a King, whilst they performed their Respects to
him; But when those that are sent to him make their Addresses
elsewhere, and in a Fashion derogatory to his Government, he will let them
and the World know, that <HI>Eng∣land</HI> is a Monarchy, and he the Monarch;
and that no Addresses in his Kingdom must be made but to him, or by his
Approbation: That his Majesty had had from several Hands a very good
Character of the Count and his Temper, and hoped when he came, he would bring
Or∣ders proportionable to such a Temper: That the King and Duke had declared
their Consent to the Marriage of the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> with the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> which employed the Jollity of the Town that Night, which was
all at prefent from, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> was about this time tryed for High
Treason: <HI>Oates, Bedlow, Dug∣dale,</HI> and <HI>Prance</HI> were
Witnesses against him. <HI>Oates</HI> deposed, That Sir <HI>George
Wakeman</HI> had, to his Knowledge, accepted of Fifteen Thou∣sand Pounds, to
poyson the King, and had re∣ceived Five Thousand Pounds of it.
<HI>Bedlow</HI> deposed, That meeting Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> at
<HI>Harcourt</HI>'s Chamber, he had acquainted him with his Design of
poysoning the King: But Sir <HI>Philip Lloyd,</HI> Clerk of the Privy
Council, deposed, That <HI>Oates</HI> before the Council being 
<PB N="298" REF="318"/> asked, upon the first Discovery of the Plot,
whether he could say any thing of his own Knowledge, of Sir <HI>George
Wakeman,</HI> he answe∣red, God forbid, for he knew nothing of his own
Knowledge, but he had heard Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> was to poyson the
King. To this <HI>Oates</HI> answered, That at the Council he was much
disturbed, and his Memory was by that disor∣dered. And <HI>Bedlow</HI>
being asked by the Jury, whether he had seen Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI>
be∣fore he met him at <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s Chamber, he answered, No: Whereupon
the Jury reflected, that Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> must needs be very
indiscreet to intrust him with so great a Secret; and so Sir <HI>George
Wakeman,</HI> with three other Prisoners, <HI>Marshal, Corker,</HI> and a
Lay-Brother, were all absolved after one Hour's Consultation.
<HI>Dugdale</HI> and <HI>Prance</HI> being the other Witnesses, spake
only as to the Plot in general; so that Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> was
acquitted upon very good Reason, the Tryal having lasted from Eight in the
Morning till Six at Night: But the common People would have all Papists
hanged without more ado, and were much en∣raged against both Jury and Judges,
and swore they were all turned Papists.</P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>July</HI> 1679, the Privy Coun∣cil ordered a
Proclamation should be drawn up for a new Parliament to meet the 7th of
<HI>Octo∣ber</HI>; but the King ordered in Council at <HI>Ham∣pton Court,</HI>
that the Parliament should not meet till the 17th of <HI>October,</HI> the
King intending to go to <HI>Newmarket</HI> some time in that Month, and 
<PB N="299" REF="319"/> would after return to attend the Business in
Parliament without Intermission; but this Par∣liament was afterwards
prorogued from the 17th of <HI>October</HI> to the 15th of <HI>April.</HI> In
the mean time there came out every Day such Swarms of impudent licentious
Libels upon all Sorts of Persons, and upon all Subjects, printed, as the like
was never known, and will be still conti∣nued whilst the <HI>Habeas
Corpus</HI> is still in Force, and that they are sure to be bailed.</P>
<P>The King having written to the University of
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> to let them know how much he was displeased with the
undutiful Carriage of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> they did presently
chuse a new Chancellor. On the 21st of <HI>April</HI> 1679, the King being
in his Robes in the House of Lords, and the Commons attending with their
Speaker, his Majesty made this following Speech to them.</P>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought it necessary to acquaint you what I have
done this Day, which is, that I have established a new Privy-Council, the
constant Number of which shall not exceed Thirty. I have made Choice of
such Persons as are worthy and able to advise me: And I am resolved in
all my weighty and important Affairs (next to the Advice of my great Council in
Parliament, with which I shall very often consult) to be advised by this
Council. I would not make so great a Change without acquainting both Houses
of Par∣liament: And I desire you will all apply your selves 
<PB N="300" REF="320"/> heartily (as I shall do) to those things that are
necessary for the Safety of the Kingdom, and that no Time may be lost in
it. The constant Number of the Council is to be Thirty, amongst which the
Princes of the Blood, the President and Secre∣tary of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are
not reckoned; because it may happen there may be none of the first nor
se∣cond, and the <HI>Scotch</HI> Secretary will not be con∣stantly
there.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>His Majesty then told both Houses, that he would hold no
more Cabinet Councils: A De∣claration from the King is expected upon this
Change, which it is believed was hatched at a Meeting of the Privy Council the
Night be∣fore, which was so private, that the Clerks of the Council attending
were ordered to with∣draw, which is not usual; and this Change did not meet
with that general Approbation of the House of Commons, as a Condescension
of that Nature seemed to challenge, as we may perceive by deferring the
Consideration of giving his Ma∣jesty Thanks for his Speech, which in good
Manners they ought to have done immediately.</P>
<P>The Day before the King declared this great Change of his
Council, the House of Commons came to this Resolution, That it was their
Opi∣nion, that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> being a Papist, and the Hopes of his
coming such to the Crown, had given the greatest Countenance and
Encou∣ragement to the present Conspiracy of the Pa∣pists against his
Majesty and the Protestant Re∣ligion; and this Resolution was sent up
to the <PB N="301" REF="321"/> Lords, for their Concurrence, by the Lord
<HI>Russel.</HI> The House of Commons made likewise an Address to his
Majesty in the <HI>Banqueting-House,</HI> That <HI>Pickering</HI> and the
other Popish Priests con∣demned might be speedily executed. To which his
Majesty answered, That he was very tender of Blood, but would send them
an Answer to their Address very speedily. The Commons then voted, That a
Bill should be brought in, for disabling the Duke of York to inherit the
imperial Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and that they would stand by the King
with their Lives and Fortunes; and that if the King (which God forbid) should
be taken away by any sudden Accident, they would revenge him to the ut∣most
upon all the Papists in <HI>England.</HI> The Tryal of the Lords in the
<HI>Tower</HI> was deferred for some time, and a Committee of both Houses
met to adjust the Preliminaries. The Lords have at last come to
Resolution, that the Lords Spiritual have a right to stay in Court in all
capital Causes, till such time as Judgment of Death comes to be pronounced,
which they have declared and explained to be, till the House proceeds to the
Votes of Guilty, or Not Guilty. The Commons were not at all con∣tented with
this Declaration of the Lords, nor with their Lordships having appointed the
Tryal of the Popish Lords in the <HI>Tower,</HI> be∣fore the Earl of
<HI>Danby</HI> came to his Tryal.</P>
<P>The 9th of <HI>July</HI> 1679, the Council ordered a
Proclamation should be drawn up for a new Parliament; but his Majesty
finding that the <PB N="302" REF="322"/> two Houses could not agree about the
Tryal of the Lords, and that they grew to excessive Heats, was pleased to
prorogue them till the 24th of <HI>August,</HI> and the next Day he sent
for the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Council, and gave them Orders
to appease all groundless Jealousies which some Men endeavou∣red to
raise in People's Minds; and the Justices of the Peace in
<HI>Middlesex</HI> had the like Orders given them in Council, and to proceed
to put the Laws in Execution against the Papists: And the Lord Chancellor
acquainted the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, that the King commanded them to put the
Laws exactly in Execution against Pa∣pists: And because some might
pretend to be in Town as Witnesses for the Popish Lords in the
<HI>Tower,</HI> and others might presume, upon the Pro∣roguing of the
Parliament, to appear, which be∣fore they durst not do, his Majesty
commanded to double their Diligence for finding out all Papists, and
proceeding to a speedy Conviction of them, his Majesty being resolved,
that they should be proceeded against with greater Seve∣rity than if the
Parliament were sitting, the King being absolutely resolved to clear the
City of Papists: And, a farther Mark of the King's Zeal in these
Proceedings was, that he comman∣ded the several Priests who had been
condemned should be executed forthwith according to the Sentence passed
upon them. So much did his Majesty's Proceedings differ now from the Opi∣nion
he had at <HI>Cologne,</HI> which was never to put the Penal Laws in
Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="323"/>It seems the Lords and Commons could not
come to any Agreement about the Try∣als of the Lords in the <HI>Tower.</HI> The
Com∣mons resolved to have the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> come first, and to
exclude the Bishops from sitting ill the Court; so that the King was
necessitated to a Prorogation, to abate their Heats; and there was an
Expedient intended to be proposed in the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s Case,
which was, That he should be perpetually banished and degraded, to see
how that would take: But the Earl's Consent being asked to the
Proposition, he po∣sitively refused it, and said he would stand or
fall by his Pardon, and nothing else.</P>
<P>The Heats which appeared upon proroguing the Parliament in
<HI>June</HI> 1679, were much aba∣ted, and People's Thoughts somewhat quieted
by what the King had pleased to do; since first, by giving strict
Orders to the Lord Mayor and Justices of the Peace of
<HI>Westminster,</HI> to put the Laws in Execution against the Papists,
and di∣recting Mr. Attorney General to bring those that were Prisoners for
the Plot to a speedy Tryal; in commanding the Execution of the condemned
Priests, and in ordering an Account to be made in every County, of those
Persons that are fitting to be Justices of Peace, and in declaring the Duke
of <HI>York</HI> should not return during the Prorogation.</P>
<P>There was a warm Report about this time, that the Earl of
<HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was to leave the Council, and the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI> to
be made Lord President in his Place. The Occasion of this 
<PB N="304" REF="324"/> Report was, that the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI> was a great
Assertor of the Rights of the Lords and the Bishops, when the Earl of
<HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was of a contrary Opinion. It seems the House of
Com∣mons continued very eager upon the Search of such Persons as had in the
last Parliament re∣ceived any Money, which was put upon the Account of
secret Service; and having gotten a List of many Names, they examined Sir
<HI>Ste∣phen Fox,</HI> the Pay-Master General, if he had not payed Money to
such as they named. He confessed, that he had payed several Sums, and
named the Persons to whom he had payed Mo∣ney for secret Service; but the
Commons being not content with his verbal Confession, they would see his
Books of Accompts, and sent a Committee of the House to <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
to fetch the Books; but the Lord Chamberlain told the Committee, that, by
virtue of his Office, he could not suffer any Search to be made in the King's
House, without his Majesty's Leave; and so the Committee went away
without them, but Mr. <HI>Bertie</HI> was kept in Custody for not de∣livering
his Books of the Treasury.</P>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> 1679, Sir <HI>Lionel Jenkins</HI> landed at
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> and went directly to <HI>Windsor</HI> to kiss the
King's Hands, and was very well re∣ceived of his Majesty. The Duke's Arrival
at <HI>Windsor</HI> from <HI>Brussels</HI> incognito, was a great
Surprize to them. His Royal Highness was most kindly received by the King;
but it was not determined whether he should continue in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or
return to <HI>Brussels.</HI> Great Numbers <PB N="305" REF="325"/> of People
of all Qualities did daily come to Court to kiss the Duke's Hands, which
makes the World believe his Presence is very accepta∣ble. About this time the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> laid down his Commission of being General, and
was by his Majesty's Command to leave <HI>England</HI> in few Days; and the
Duke of <HI>York</HI> is likewise to return to <HI>Brussels.</HI> He is
at pre∣sent lodged in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and will go with his Majesty to
<HI>New-market,</HI> to which Place he is resolved to go, tho' his
Physicians advise the contrary. It is said the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
is often in Discourse with the King, not having a Mind to leave
<HI>England,</HI> and is passing his Par∣don under the Great Seal, before
he goes, the King being resolved upon his going. When the King and Queen go
to <HI>New-market,</HI> the Duke of <HI>York</HI> returns towards
<HI>Brussels,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> goes for
<HI>Holland,</HI> intending to reside at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> having lent him his House at <HI>Rhenen.</HI> The Dutchess
does not accompany the Duke, the King having disswaded her from it.</P>
<P>I was about this time informed from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that the
17th of <HI>October</HI> drawing on, when the Parliament was to meet, I
should have News from thence, but they could not promise me it should be
good at the same time; and from the same Hand I was told, that the Lord
Chief Justice being in his Circuit, and giving his Charge to the Grand Jury,
amongst other things, recommended unto them the strict executing the Laws
against Papists: Whereupon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> 
<PB N="306" REF="326"/> (who was in the Court upon the Bench) stood up and
said, <HI>It was well indeed if that were done; but that the Lord Chief
Justice, when he gave that Charge, did not mean it should be obser∣ved,
because he was a Favourer of the Papists, and that he</HI> (the Duke)
<HI>knew he had private Or∣ders to assist and favour the Papist all he
could:</HI> Which last is a Reflection upon the King pu∣nishable by the
Law, which declares it Trea∣son to say the King is a Papist. It is added
to me in my Letter, from a very good Hand, that the Duke did hereupon
abscond, and that the Chief Justice, before he gave out his Warrant,
complained to the King, and had the King's Directions in it, and I have been
since told, that the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was gone pri∣vately into
<HI>Holland,</HI> and was there seen by them that well knew his Grace.</P>
<P>The Parliament was prorogued this Day for Fourteen Days longer,
his Majesty having de∣clared to the Council, that he was desirous to
spend some more Days at <HI>New-market,</HI> finding that Air very
agreeable to him; and that after his Return he had several Matters to prepare
for the Parliament, which he thought would not be unpleasing to them, which
would not be ready against the Time it was at first inten∣ded they should
be. The Yacht that carried his Royal Highness to <HI>Brussels</HI> did
bring back the Lady <HI>Anne</HI> and the Lady <HI>Isabella</HI> to
<HI>London,</HI> with the Dutchess of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>October</HI> Mr. Secretary <HI>Coven∣try</HI>
communicated a Letter to those in his Of∣fice, <PB N="307" REF="327"/> which
he had then received from <HI>New∣market</HI> by the King's Command, that the
Duke of <HI>York,</HI> before his Return to <HI>Brussels,</HI> had
de∣sired he might live in the Dominions of his Majesty, rather than in
those of any other Prince; and having asked the King's Leave to go to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the King had granted it, and ac∣cordingly had ordered two
Frigates to be ready in the <HI>Downes</HI> to transport his Royal
Highness, and the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was dispatched to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> to make Preparations for his Royal Highness's Reception,
which was hindered for some time by the unlucky Accident which happened at
Sea. However, the 12th of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> both their Royal Highnesses
arrived at Court, and were very well received by all that End of the Town, but
I know not whether I can say so much for the other: Their Stay will be
short, being designed for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where, by his Majesty's
Leave, they intend to reside.</P>
<P>The 17th of <HI>October</HI> 1679, the Parliament met, and were
prorogued to the 28th of <HI>Janu∣ary</HI>; and at the same time, one of the
princi∣pal Secretaries of State, by his Letter to the Earl of
<HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> let his Lordship know, by the King's Command, that his
Majesty intended to make no more Use of his Lordship at the Council
Table; and not only excused his Lord∣ship for attending as President of
the Council, but discharged him from his farther Attendance there; and the
24th of the same Month his Majesty ordered the Earl of <HI>Radnor</HI> to
take the Place of Lord President of the Council <PB N="308" REF="328"/> Table,
in the Place of the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> which the Earl of
<HI>Radnor</HI> did accordingly. Mr. <HI>Oates</HI>'s Complaint against Sir
<HI>Philip Lloyd,</HI> one of the Clerks of the Council, was heard, and it
being proved that Sir <HI>Philip</HI> had, in a Coffee-house, spoken some
Words, as if he did not believe the Plot, and besides, spoke
in∣discreetly at the Tryal of Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI>; the King, as a
Mark of his Displeasure, suspen∣ded him the Execution of his Place.
Then the Matter against Sir <HI>Thomas Williams</HI> the Chymist was heard;
and it appearing that, of his own Head, he had gone with pretended Messages
between the Duke and Mr. <HI>Oates,</HI> which he then denied, as well as
some Words which were proved he had said to Mr. <HI>Oates,</HI> viz.
<HI>That he knew enough to ruine the Duke and all his Party,</HI> he was, by
Order of the Council, committed to the <HI>Gate-House.</HI> It seems Mr.
<HI>Oates</HI> was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and would have had the same Degree of
Doctor as he pre∣tended to have had at <HI>Salamanca,</HI> but they re∣fused
him.</P>
<P>We are told, their Royal Hignesses, in their Passage for
<HI>Scotland,</HI> stayed some Days at <HI>York</HI> to rest themselves
before they went into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
did not shew that Respect to them which they expected; of which the King
being informed, and that their Behaviour differed much from what it did before,
at the Duke's former Passage there, his Majesty was thereupon much
displea∣sed, the which he signified to the Lord Mayor 
<PB N="309" REF="329"/> and Aldermen of that City, letting them know, that his
Majesty expects, whenever the Duke passes that Way again, that they treat
him in the same Manner as they did formerly, and that they shew him that
Respect which becomes all good Subjects to shew to the King's Brother. The
<HI>Scots</HI> seem greatly pleased at the Duke's Coming, and that they
shall have a Court kept amongst them.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the 3d, 1679, I am told, they are again at
<HI>London</HI> launched into the Business of the Plot, one
<HI>Dangerfield</HI> having been several Days before the Council in
Examination; but People are not very hasty to give Credit to his Relation,
who hath been once, if not oftener, in the Pillory, and is now in
<HI>Newgate.</HI> A Proclamation is in the Press, and will sud∣denly
issue out, for giving Notice, that who∣ever knows any thing of the Plot,
and does not discover it before the End of next <HI>February,</HI> he is to
expect the Penalty of the Law for Misprision of Treason, and is not to
have any Benefit of Pardon. About this time there was another new Discoverer
of the Plot upon the King's Life come in: He was a Servant to Sir <HI>Thomas
Gascoign,</HI> a <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Gentleman of a great Estate, and
great Age. However, he is sent for to <HI>Whitehall</HI> by a Messenger.
These several Discoverers, will, I hope, let us see the Bottom, or at
least the End once of this Matter. I am informed from a good Hand at
<HI>Whitehall,</HI> of a warm Report spread abroad, that the Earl of
<HI>Essex,</HI> First Commissioner of the Treasury, 
<PB N="310" REF="330"/> and his Brother Sir <HI>Henry Capel,</HI> First
Com∣missioner of the Admiralty, are both withdraw∣ing themselves from the
Court and Council, tho' there be no Reason yet known for it, the King not
having shewed any Disfavour to either of them. The Humour is much changed,
when such Men quit their Places without any visible Reasons; and
therefore we may well think the King will be as willing to accept, as they are
to resign.</P>
<P>I had Letters from <HI>Whitehall</HI> of the 20th of
<HI>November,</HI> which said, the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> came to Town
unlook'd for; that so soon as his Coming was known, the People made
Bon∣fires, shot off Guns, and rung their Bells. He offered to see the King,
but his Majesty not only refused him, because he returned without his
Orders, but forbad him the Court, and or∣dered him to return within Twenty Four
Hours, when Preparations were making of new Bon∣fires, which were
suppressed; and yet the Duke continued still in Town, the 8th of
<HI>December,</HI> but stript of all Employments, and no great Talk of
him.</P>
<P>An Address hath been made to the King by Eight Lords, for the
Meeting of the Parlia∣ment at the Time appointed, and the same has been done
by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to the King in Council, where, after the Lord
Chancellor had done, the King spoke himself, and told the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen with great Earnestness, That he could not endure any longer
those factious Doings, and expected the City of <HI>London</HI> should be
an Example to <PB N="311" REF="331"/> the whole Kingdom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A
Proclamation was then ordered to be printed and published, to forewarn all
People from signing such Petitions, shewing the Danger they will run
themselves into by so doing.</P>
<P>The 15th of <HI>October</HI> 1679, the Justices of
<HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> were called before the Privy
Council, and were strictly charged to put the Laws in Execution against the
Papists, and that they should meet and consult of such Expedients as
they should think most effectual, and return the same to the Board; and a
Com∣mittee of the Council were appointed Com∣missioners to receive and
consider of such Pro∣positions, and to propose such other Expedients
as should occur to them. Hereupon the Justi∣ces of Peace of
<HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> did make their Report to the
Council, of the seve∣ral Expedients which they had agreed to amongst
themselves, for the better executing the Laws against Papists, which the
Privy Council ap∣proved of. It seems, notwithstanding the Pro∣clamation,
some seditious People would fain bring on the Petitions, as well about the
Court, as in <HI>Essex</HI>; and tho' they are not considerable enough to
bring the Matter to any Head, yet it may give Encouragement to others, if it be
not punished: And upon Information of this, the Privy Council have sent for
Three or Four of the principal Persons ingaged herein, and the great
Expectation is, to see how they will proceed against them: And it is
suspected, that the City of <HI>London,</HI> with some of the Coun∣ties 
<PB N="312" REF="332"/> adjoining, have not quite laid aside their Design of
Petitioning his Majesty for a Parlia∣ment, notwithstanding there is small
Appea∣rance it will be to any Effect. In the mean time, the Privy Council have
taken several Re∣solutions concerning the vigorous Prosecution of the
Papists, which will be executed without any Connivance or Partiality, and the
particu∣lar Method that will be taken, is set down in a Proclamation that is
now in the Press for that Purpose. We are told from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that
the Duke has taken his Place in the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and as
First Prince of the Blood, was dispensed with as to taking the Oaths,
which is likewise the Practice in <HI>England:</HI> For, at the forming the
present Privy Council, all the Lords were sworn, except Prince
<HI>Rupert,</HI> who being a Prince of the Blood, he was not sworn.</P>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1680, I received this ensuing Let∣ter from
Mr. Secretary <HI>Jenkins.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am infinitely obliged to you for your constant
Correspondence. Last Night, a Defensive Alliance between his Majesty
and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was signed: It is the same in Effect with
that made in 1673, between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and that in
1678 between his Majesty and <HI>Hol∣land.</HI> It is his Majesty's
Instruction to all his Ministers abroad, not to make any Flourish or
Noise on our Part of this League, but only to own and avow (upon all
Occasions that shall be given by the Enquiries of other Men) that there 
<PB N="313" REF="333"/> is such a League newly made; that it is such a one
that can give no Offence or Umbrage to any Neighbour Prince, it being purely
defensive, and inducing no Obligation, but that the two Kings defend each
other in their present Peace and Possessions, against any that
shall aggress or in∣vade them. I am, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most Humble Servant, <HI>L.
JENKINS.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Some time after this, the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> peti∣tioned the
King and House of Lords, that he might be tryed; but nothing being done in
it, his Lordship petitioned farther, that he might be bailed, and his Case
was argued by Mr. <HI>Polexton, Wallop,</HI> and <HI>Holt,</HI> and likewise
by my Lord him∣self. The Substance of what was said is reducible to Four
Heads. First, The King's Prerogative. Secondly, The Liberty of the Subject.
Thirdly, The Privilege of Parliament: And Fourthly, The Jurisdiction of the
Court of King's Bench.</P>
<P>First, It was urged, That, by bailing of my Lord, the King's
Prerogative would be main∣tained, which would otherwise suffer by his
longer Confinement: For that he produced the King's Pardon, as a great Motive
to incline the Court to bail him. Besides that, Mr. Attorney had declared the
King's particular Inclination to consent to it; and the King having Power to
pardon a Person impeached (which Mr. <HI>Polex∣ton</HI> said no Man of the
Robe ought to question) tho' the Impeachment be not at his Suit, it was hoped
the Court would take so much Notice of <PB N="314" REF="334"/> these
Intimations of his Majesty's Justice, as to let my Lord out upon Bail,
whereby they would assert the King's true Power and just Prerogative; it
being hard, that there shall not be a Power of Bailing where there is a Power
of Pardoning.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Liberty of the Subject will be preserved by it;
for if there be no Remedy for any Person impeached, but that he must lye by
it, till he be enlarged by the same Power that committed him, it would
follow, that, during the Recesses of Parliament, a Failure of Justice
would arise, which will be a heavy Blow to that natural Freedom to which the
Sub∣jects of <HI>England</HI> by Birth-right are intituled; and such a
Punishment as is not only a Con∣demnation, but may prove even an Execution
before Tryal: For probably, my Lord being oppressed with the Inconvenience
of the Place, and with his own Infirmities, may die in the Jayl before his
Enlargement by his Peers, and the Stain of his Impeachment dwell upon his
Memory, and his Posterity for ever: For the Prevention of which lamentable
Case, and for Preservation of that due Liberty which the King's Subjects
ought to have, it was conceived that my Lord ought to be bailed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Privileges of Parliament would not hereby be
infringed; for, to bail a Man being committed by a superior Court, is not to
assume a Jurisdiction of his Cause, or any way to claim a Cognizance of
it (which it was granted the Court of King's Bench, in Cases of 
<PB N="315" REF="335"/> Impeachment, ought not to do) but it was on∣ly an
enlarging of his Prison, or (as Mr. <HI>Wal∣lop</HI> said, a lengthening of
his Chain, instead of his remaining <HI>in arcta custodia,</HI> for so is
every Man let out upon good Bail presumed to be; and the Law looks upon his
Forthcoming to be as secure as if he were under close Confinement: So that
such a Proceeding as this is not to in∣trench, or to encroach upon the
Privileges of Parliament, but only to avoid a great Evil, a Failure of
Justice.</P>
<P>Fourthly, By bailing my Lord of <HI>Danby,</HI> the Court would
assert their own Jurisdiction, it being conceived that the Court of
King's Bench have always intermeddled with Circum∣stances and mediate Acts
relating to things done in Parliament, thereafter, as the Necessity of the
Case required (tho' not with the very things themselves) and to that
Purpose several Prece∣dents were cited; as one of <HI>Okey,</HI> and two
other Traitors, who were attainted in Parliament, and before Execution awarded,
there happened a Pro∣rogation. Whereupon the Record of their Con∣viction was
removed into the King's Bench, and the Prisoners brought to the Bar, and
having nothing to say why Execution should not be awarded against them,
were accordingly exe∣cuted. This was the Sum of what was said by all those
that argued. The Court was divided, whether they should give their Opinion
pre∣sently, or take Time; but they resolved to con∣sider till the next
Term, and my Lord was again remanded to Prison.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="336"/>Upon this Occasion, I have thought fit
to give a Copy of the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Pember∣ton</HI>'s Charge, upon
summing up the Evidence upon the Tryal of <HI>Fitzharris</HI> in
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="charge">
<P>THE Prisoner at the Bar, Gentlemen of of the Jury, is
charged with Treason, for Libelling the Government, and setting others to
do it. Whether <HI>Fitzharris</HI> be the Author of this Libel, or not, is the
Question. The Evi∣dence against him is very great. Mr. <HI>Everard</HI>
declares to you the whole Design and Discourse with him; he tells you the
Manner, and gives you the very Grounds on which the Libel was to be written. It
was, to raise Sedition, to make an Insurrection, and to stir up People to
rebel. Mr. <HI>Eve∣rard</HI> was so cautious, that he walked not alone in
this Case, but with much Prudence declared it to others, that they might be
Witnesses with him, and Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> agrees with him in all things:
How he heard <HI>Fitzharris</HI> give the Directions for ma∣king this Libel,
heard the Design of it, and the Reward promised for the doing it, which was
the first Night. The next Night Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> was present,
and says, <HI>Fitzharris</HI> gave the same Instructions, and owned them;
and what is not to be answered, they are all under his own Hand; which
Directions are Treason enough, and is as strong an Evidence against him
as perhaps ever was; and I think a plainer Evidence cannot be given, than that
<HI>Fitzharris</HI> is the Author of this Libel. The Witnesses he brings
for himself are Mr. <HI>Oates</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cor∣nish:</HI> 
<PB N="317" REF="337"/> The First says, That, Mr. <HI>Everard</HI> told him,
this was a Design, and that it should be put in∣to the Pockets of some
Lords and Members of Parliament, and that they should be apprehen∣ded and
questioned for the Libel: But Mr. <HI>Eve∣rard</HI> upon his Oath testifies
he never said any such thing. Then Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI> says, That
ha∣ving some Discourse with his Majesty concerning Mr.
<HI>Fitzharris,</HI> the King said, he was an ill Man, and had some Money
from him for some Service he promised to do him; but it can never be
thought, that the King would give Money to stir up his Sub∣jects against
him, or to hazard all that is near and dear to him: And if you believe
<HI>Fitzharris</HI>'s own Hand-writing, or any Evidence that can be given, 'tis
a plain Case that he is Guilty: And for saying, he would charge you with
his Blood, because he is impeached by the Commons, that's nothing at all to
the Matter, nor are you to have any Consideration, whether we have Power to
try him, or not; that is a Question already de∣termined: There lyes no more
before you, who are the Jury, but only to consider, whether Guilty, or Not
Guilty. And as to the Vote of the Commons, that can no more alter the Laws of
the Land, than a Letter to us from the King, of which we are not to take
Notice, being upon our Oaths to do Justice, and see if he be Guilty, or
not. If he be Guilty, you can no more spare him, than condemn an innocent
Man. The Vote of the House of Commons can neither excuse us nor you: We are
to try Matters of Law, and you the Matter of Fact. But you, Mr.
<HI>Johnson,</HI> <PB N="318" REF="338"/> who are the Foreman of the Jury, to
give you all manner of Satisfaction, this Doubt was mo∣ved to my Brother
<HI>Jones,</HI> when he gave the Charge to the Grand Jury; upon which all the
Judges of <HI>England</HI> met, and they all agreed we might try him: And this
was done, to re∣move all manner of Scruple that might arise.</P>

<P>Some few Days after this, Sheriff <HI>Bethel</HI> having
received a Warrant for the Execution of Mr. <HI>Oliver Plunket</HI> and Mr.

<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> having lately passed up and
down the Kingdom in a Manner that gave much Offence to his Majesty; and
having been at <HI>West-Chester,</HI> where the Mayor being a 
<PB N="320" REF="340"/> Fanatick, and his Wife Neice to the late
<HI>Brad∣shaw,</HI> the Great Traitor, his Grace was very well received by
them; but at <HI>Litchfield, Coventry,</HI> and other Places, neither the
Magi∣strates nor Gentry took much Notice of him. However, by the King's
Command, a Sergeant at Arms was sent down to <HI>Stafford</HI> to bring him
up; and being brought to one of the Secreta∣ries of State, after Examination of
him, he committed him by a second Warrant to the Custody of the Sergeant at
Arms (which War∣rant charged his Grace to have passed thro' se∣veral
Parts of the Kingdom, with great Num∣bers of People, in a riotous Manner, to
the Disturbance of the Publick Peace, and to the Terror of the King's good
Subjects) who was to keep him in Custody, till he should give Security to
appear at the King's Bench, the First Day of the next Term, to answer to
such Information as should be brought against him on the King's Behalf;
and that in the mean time he should be of good Behaviour. And the First Day
of the Term the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was upon his <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI>
brought before Judge <HI>Raymond,</HI> where he gave the desired Se∣curity;
the Earl of <HI>Clare,</HI> the Lord <HI>Russel,</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Gower</HI> and Mr. <HI>Offeley,</HI> being his Bail. The Duke was bound
in Ten Thou∣sand Pounds, and the Bail each in Two Thou∣sand Pounds. The
Behaviour of the Duke gives the King every Day more Offence, and particu∣larly
his having accosted the Earl of <HI>Hallifax</HI> with very unbecoming
Language, upon Ac∣count <PB N="321" REF="341"/> of something supposed his
Lordship had said in Council concerning the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth.</HI> The
King was pleased in Council to declare, That he looked upon it as an
Insolence offered to himself, for any one to question a Privy
Counsellour for any thing said in Coun∣cil; and did strictly forbid all
Persons having any Relation to his Service, to have for the future any
Communication with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who hath been so angry with
his Wife for seeing the Dutchess, by whom she was very kindly received,
that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> will not see his Dutchess.</P>
<P>An Action of <HI>Scandalum Magnatum,</HI> in Be∣half of the
Duke, was brought against Mr. <HI>Pil∣kington,</HI> for Words spoken by him
when his Royal Highness dined last in <HI>London</HI> with the
<HI>Artillery Company.</HI> The Words spoken were these: <HI>He hath burnt
the City, and is now come to cut our Throats: Innuendo</HI> the Duke of
<HI>York.</HI> The Jury were all Gentlemen of Quality of
<HI>Hertfordshire</HI> (which County Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> had chosen)
and they gave his Royal Highness One Hundred Thousand Pounds Damage; which
will doubtless teach factious Persons, who have lived of late with so
much Licence in their Discourses, to govern their Tongues better.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>Scotland</HI> tell us, that Affairs go there
according to Wish: That the Parlia∣ment there have written a Letter of Thanks
to the King, for sending the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which we hope will break
the Measures of those <PB N="322" REF="342"/> who flattered themselves
with a Support from that Kingdom, which has not been in many Ages more united
than it is at present, under the prudent Conduct of his Royal Highness. Our
Letters from thence tell us, that the Lords of the Articles had prepared three
publick Bills; the First, for recognizing the Rights of the Crown and the
Succession; the Second, for continuing a Tax for Five Years longer, for
Maintainance of the standing Forces: The Third, a Bill for establishing
the Protestant Religion, which passed very chearfully in the Articles,
and Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> concurred in them all. The Letters add, That the
Duke is high∣ly esteemed and beloved of all Sorts of People, and that there
is a constant and great Court of Lords and Ladies. Major <HI>Oglethorp</HI>
brings this Account, which is very pleasing to all the People in this
Court.</P>
<P>The Apprentices in <HI>London</HI> presented their Petition to
his Majesty, with Twelve Thousand Hands, to give his Majesty Thanks for
his late Declaration. It met with a gracious Ac∣ceptance, and those that
carried it were intro∣duced by the Lord Chamberlain, and had the Honour to
kiss his Majesty's Hand. The King gave them a Brace of Bucks out of
<HI>Hyde</HI> Park, and they made a great Feast in <HI>London.</HI> The Duke
of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and many of the Nobility did them the Honour to be
present at their Feast, which they intend to keep annually; and the Duke of
<HI>Grafton</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Feversham</HI> have done them the Honour
to be their Stew∣ards <PB N="323" REF="343"/> for the next Year. The Apprentices
of <HI>Bristol,</HI> in Imitation of those of <HI>London,</HI> have
subscribed an Address, to give the King their most humble Thanks for
his gracious Declara∣tion. The Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Norfolk</HI> have
done the like; and the Addresses from all Parts on the same Account come
in very fast; and one has been presented from the Lieute∣nancy of
<HI>London,</HI> and from <HI>Southwark,</HI> and 'tis wished they may have
the good Effect they were intended for.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> with the Court of Aldermen,
attended the King at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> with a Petition from the Common
Coun∣cil, desiring his Majesty to assemble a Parlia∣ment. The Lord
Chancellor, by the King's Command, gave them a very severe Reprimand, telling
them, that the King wondered how they durst bring such a Paper to him in
Name of the City, when it was against the Sense of the best Part of the
City: That the King knew there were restless Spirits amongst them, and
would set a Mark upon them; and that if they went on in those Courses, he
would make them sensible of his Displeasure. The 7th of <HI>July</HI>
1681, the Lord Mayor came again to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> with a Petition of
the Common Coun∣cil, and the Lord Chancellor gave them an An∣swer much like
the last. This Morning the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was taken by a Warrant
from Sir <HI>Lionel Jenkins,</HI> and his Trunks and Papers seized, and both
he and they were car∣ried before the Council, where he was exami∣ned 
<PB N="324" REF="344"/> so privately, that all the Clerks of the Council were
turned out. It is said, he was taken upon the Information of Mr.
<HI>Haynes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Macknamarra,</HI> and <HI>Ivy,</HI> who, 'tis said,
corroborate the Testimony <HI>Fitzharris</HI> gave to Mr. <HI>Hawkins,</HI>
amongst whose Papers is found one of Instructions or Directions to
<HI>Fitzharris,</HI> with several Heads of what he should plead, and what
he should swear to. The Hand is very well known, and will be made publick.
The King was present at this extraordinary Council held at
<HI>Whitehall,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was brought in
Custody of a Ser∣geant at Arms, and was told there was a Charge of High
Treason against him, which would be proved by several Witnesses;
whereupon he was committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and that Evening the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth,</HI> with several Lords, went to visit him, which
occasioned a greater Restraint upon him; and he and my Lord <HI>Howard</HI>
are both close Prisoners, and only their Wives are permitted to come to
them.</P>
<P>The Proceedings this Session at the <HI>Old Baily</HI> were
very remarkable, most of the Judges be∣ing there, and many Persons of the
first Qua∣lity; as, the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and several others. Mr.
<HI>Wallop</HI> and Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> pleaded hard for the <HI>Habeas
Corpus</HI> for the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and the Lord <HI>Howard:</HI>
But the <HI>Tower</HI> being a Prison out of the City, and their Meeting
being only a Session of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Ter∣miner,</HI> the
<HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> could not lye in that Court. A Bill of Indictment was
then presen∣ted <PB N="325" REF="345"/> to the Grand Jury of the City of
<HI>London,</HI> against <HI>Colledge,</HI> the <HI>Protestant Joyner,</HI>
as he was always called. The Witnesses against him were Mr.
<HI>Smith,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dugdale,</HI> Mr. <HI>Haynes,</HI> the two
<HI>Macknamara's,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Jen∣nings.</HI> They all
positively swore, that <HI>Colledge</HI> told them, there was a Design to
seize the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and bring him to <HI>London,</HI> and
there keep him, till he had complied with them, or else to bring him to the
Block, as they did his Father; and that in this Design the House of Lords
and Commons were concerned, and that there was an Army ready at <HI>London</HI>
to assist them. It is certainly true, that never Men swore more firmly
than they did in Court, be∣fore the Jury, who demanded of the Court a Copy of
their Oaths, and that the Witnesses might go with them, to be examined
apart; which Request was granted to the Jury, and after two or three Hours
Consideration, the Jury returned, and found the Bill <HI>Ignoramus.</HI> Upon
which the Lord Chief Justice demanded, whether they would give no Reason
for this Verdict; and whether they believed those Six Witnesses perjured?
To which they replied, That they had given their Verdict according to their
Consciences, and that they would stand by it. To which the Lord Chief
Justice <HI>North</HI> said, <HI>There was never such a Verdict brought
in the World.</HI> The Grand Jury, before they were discharged, delivered a
Petition to the Court, desiring the Removal of the Priests and Jesuits
farther from the Lords in the <HI>Tower,</HI> they <PB N="326" REF="346"/>
holding Correspondence with them. Upon bringing in this Bill <HI>Ignoramus,
Colledge</HI> will be sent to be tryed in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where the Judges
arrived the 15th of <HI>July.</HI> Their Commission was opened, and the
Grand Jury was sworn, of which Sir <HI>Thomas Spencer</HI> was Foreman; the
rest were all Gentlemen of Loyalty, and Pro∣testants, and of good
Estates; and upon hearing the Evidence against <HI>Colledge,</HI> they
found the Indictment <HI>Billa vera, nemine contradicente.</HI> One of the
Evidence against him swore, That if the King did not agree with his
Parliament, there was a Design to seize upon him, and Thirty Thousand Men
were ready in the City of <HI>London</HI> to back the Design; and that if the
King refused to pass the Bill of Exclusion, they would serve him as
they did his Father. This <HI>Colledge</HI> was brought to his Tryal at
<HI>Oxford,</HI> before the Lord Chief Justice <HI>North</HI> and Justice
<HI>Jones.</HI> The Tryal lasted from Two in the Afternoon, till Two in the
Morning, so much Time was taken up in examining the Wit∣nesses. The
Evidence against the Prisoner was the same which was at the
<HI>Old-Baily</HI>; those for the Prisoner were chiefly Mr. <HI>Oates, Mow
bray,</HI> and <HI>Waldron,</HI> who said, that <HI>Dug∣dale</HI> and
<HI>Smith</HI> told them, they knew nothing against <HI>Colledge</HI>; but
they denied it upon their Oaths, and the Jury brought him in Guilty; and some
Hours after the Prisoner received his Sentence, the Court meeting again for
that Purpose. Some Days after, <HI>Colledge</HI> was executed, and his Head
was set <PB N="327" REF="347"/> upon <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> to be a Warning to
others to avoid his Fate.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sidney</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> finding that his
Maje∣sty was much surprized at his having taken a Commission in
<HI>Holland,</HI> without his Leave, to be General of all the
<HI>English</HI> Forces there, which hath been vacant since the Death of
the Earl of <HI>Ossory,</HI> hath been perswaded by his Friends to
resign that Employment to the Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> Son to Duke
<HI>Hamilton,</HI> who is now very well at the Court in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
has the King's Leave to accept of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Regiment in
<HI>Holland,</HI> whereof <HI>Kilpatrick</HI> was Collonel, which the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> has offered him.</P>
<P>About this time the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came for
<HI>England,</HI> and was very well received by the King and Court, and had
been several times in private with the King. Various Discourses are
raised about his Coming, and his Return will be very sudden. He hath been
something unlucky at Play, having lost in one Night, Three Thou∣sand
Pounds at <HI>Basset.</HI> His Highness, whilst in <HI>London,</HI>
lodges at <HI>Arlington-House,</HI> where he hath been magnificently
entertained at the King's Charge, and hath been likewise treated very
splendidly by the Duke of <HI>Albemarle.</HI> His Highness was also
invited to dine with the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and accepted the
Invitation, and great Preparations were made for his Re∣ception; and as he was
preparing to dine in <HI>London,</HI> he received an Express from his
Ma∣jesty to come presently to <HI>Windsor,</HI> which he did, and the
Secretary of State carried his Ex∣cuse. <PB N="328" REF="348"/> After this the
Lord Mayor sent the two Sheriffs to invite his Highness to dine with him,
who promised the next Day to dine with his Lordship: But the King sent
for him again that Day; whereupon his Highness sent his own Secretary to
excuse it, and left the Lord Mayor under a very great Disappointment: And
not many Hours before he left <HI>Windsor,</HI> a Cabinet Council was there
held concerning <HI>Flanders,</HI> wherein the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was
present; but the Reason of his Coming is still kept very secret, which
none can tell. About this time the Lord Mayor carried up an Address of the
Common Hall to the King at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and gave it to the King in
Council. Sir <HI>John Shorter,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Be∣thel,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI> attended upon his Lord∣ship, who
having presented the Address to his Majesty, he was pleased to return

<P>YOU have presented the King with a Paper, which hath
been publickly printed long since; and the King doth not believe it is now
presented so much for the Satisfaction of his Majesty, as to serve for
some other End. The King knows that the major Part of the City are well
inclined to his Service, and that it is not in the Power of a few ill Men
amongst them to corrupt the rest. The King therefore doth not believe this
to be so unanimous a Vote of the City as is pretended; and he commands me

<P><PB N="331" REF="351"/>The Sessions at <HI>Hickes</HI>'s
<HI>Hall</HI> for the County beginning, and Sir <HI>George Jeffries</HI> being
Chair∣man, he objected against the Persons that were returned to serve on
the Grand Jury, as being Dissenters from the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and required the Under-Sheriff to make a new Pan∣nel of substantial good
Men; which he refu∣sing, the Court ordered the Sheriffs themselves should
attend the next Day: But, instead of them, the Recorder of <HI>London</HI>
appeared, and told the Court, that the Sheriffs having ac∣quainted the Court of

did exempt the Sheriffs from any Attendance at <HI>Hickes</HI>'s <HI>Hall</HI>;
and that it was sufficient if the Under-Sheriff did their Busi∣ness: But
the Court not allowing the Excuse, for their Contempt, fined the two Sheriffs
One Hundred Pounds, and then adjourned, and re∣solved to acquaint the Judges
with the Matter. Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> a Secretary to the Earl of

been long in the Government, before the <HI>Marquis de Grana</HI> was sent
from <HI>Spain</HI> thro' <HI>England,</HI> to be Governour of Arms in

to which if the <HI>Prince de Parma</HI> did not agree, he was then to leave
the Government to the <HI>Marquis de Grana</HI>; but this Matter was kept very
private, and the <HI>Marquis</HI> took a private House near the Court. The

was resolved to leave the Government, and using each Evening to take the

<HI>London</HI> meeting for the Choice of a Sheriff, the Sheriffs declared to
the People, that <HI>Papillion</HI> and <HI>Dubois</HI> had each Two Thousand
Voices, and were chosen; but the Lord Mayor hearing of it, went with the
usual Solemnity, and decla∣red Mr. <HI>Box</HI> the other Sheriff; and Mr.
<HI>North</HI> and <HI>Box</HI> will hold, tho' great Endeavours will be used
to disswade them; and it is believed the Proceedings of the present
Sheriffs will be severely punished. Upon the <HI>Prince de Parma</HI>'s
quitting the <HI>Spanish</HI> Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the
<HI>Marquis de Grana</HI>'s taking it upon him, it's believed that Mr.
<HI>Thomas Howard</HI> will make the King's Compliment to him.</P>
<P>About this time the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> being brought to
<HI>Hickes</HI>'s <HI>Hall,</HI> to be tryed for High Treason. The Grand Jury
found the Bill <HI>Igno∣ramus,</HI> whereupon he was acquitted, taken out of
the Hands of Justice, and Medals dispersed for his Deliverance, Treason
being frontless and secure. Such a bare-faced Affront to Au∣thority can
scarce be parallelled, as was seen at this time, when the King was soon
over-per∣swaded to take away the Lives of many honest innocent Men, purely
upon the false Assevera∣tions <PB N="340" REF="360"/> of Persons to whom
he was almost forced to give Pensions, being a Pack of profligated
Villains, who were kept in Pay to accuse any Man that opposed their wicked
Designs, with∣out any Process of Law, hearing their Defence, or any Proof
proferred against them. And after the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was thus
quitted, he retired privately into <HI>Holland,</HI> where he died in the
Beginning of 1683, of the Gout in his Stomach.</P>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1683, the Lord Mayor, with most of the
Aldermen, Sheriffs, and Recorder, with a great Number of the principal Citizens
of <HI>London,</HI> presented the King in Council with a Petition which had
been before agreed in their Common Council, wherein they did in all hum∣ble
Manner deprecate his Majesty's Displeasure against them, for their late
Miscarriages in the Government of the City, promising all Obe∣dience for
the future, and humbly begging his Majesty's Directions for their better
Conduct. The Petition was presented by the Lord May∣or kneeling, with the
Aldermen and all the Citizens likewise, till the King was pleased to bid
them rise. Then the Lord Mayor and the rest being withdrawn for some
time, they were called in again. Then the Lord Keeper deli∣vered to them his
Majesty's Pleasure, represen∣ting the great Cause of Mislike that his
Majesty had to their former Proceedings, telling them the particular
Regulations that he thought ne∣cessary to require from them; concluding,
that Judgment according to Form should be entered <PB N="341" REF="361"/>
against them on <HI>Saturday</HI> then following (which might prove very
prejudicial to some of their Privileges and Customs, which were Matters of
great Profit to them, with which his Maje∣sty did not intend to meddle)
unless they did, by the Time prescribed, voluntarily put into his
Majesty's Hands, by such Conveyance as his Attorney, Sollicitor, and
Counsel learned shall think fit, the Approving of the Officers that have
the principal Part in their Govern∣ment; such as are the Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Recorder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so as none of them enter upon the
Execution of their respective Offices, notwithstanding their being elected
in usual Manner thereunto, till his Majesty shall also have approved of
them under his Signet and Sign Manual: And many Particulars more were told them
by my Lord Keeper. It was observed by every body present, that the
Sub∣mission was very cordial, and that it was a great Satisfaction to the
Citizens, that his Majesty took this Course to preserve their Peace, and
to assert the just Rights of the Crown.</P>
<P>The next Day after there was a Common Hall in <HI>London,</HI>
where it was resolved to com∣ply with his Majesty's Demands, and they have
saved Mr. Attorney the Trouble of entering Judgment: Whereupon I had this
following Letter from Mr. Secretary <HI>Jenkins.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the Favour of yours to acknowledge, and in Return I
send you the Lord Major's and City's Submission. Many of our Friends
voted for a Seizure, upon a Scruple of Consci∣ence, desiring rather the
King should take those Liberties into his Hands by a Seizure, than come
into a Possession of them by a Surrender, since that might blanch
something upon the Oaths they took as Freemen. However, the Thing was carried
by a Fair Poll for a Surrender. Every Man is well pleased, except those
that are im∣placable, and some there are amongst us still, as it appears
by what is now broken out; for every body's Mouth is full of a most horrid
and hellish Plot against the Life of the King and his Royal Highness,
wherein many People of the first Qua∣lity are concerned. I cannot yet give
you any certain Account of the Particulars; but the De∣sign was laid in
short to shoot the King and Duke at their coming the last Season from
<HI>Newmarket,</HI> but was prevented by the King's sudden coming from
thence, by reason of the Fire which hap∣pened there. Several Persons are in
Custody upon this Account; some are fled (as <HI>Good enough,</HI> the late
Under Sheriff, and one Mr. <HI>West</HI>) and by the Confession of one of
the Accomplices, and by the Examination of another, there was a desperate
Design against the King's Life (whom God preserve) and an Insurrection
was designed to follow it. We have the Names of divers that are concerned,
but find the Birds are flown. I <PB N="343" REF="363"/> shall be able to tell
you more by the next, when you may expect farther Particulars: But this I may
now tell you, that his Majesty (who does upon all Occasions too much
slight these things) does believe there is great Appearance of Reality in
that which is now come to Light. This hath been so busy a Day with me, that
I have only Time to close this, and to tell you that I am, Sir, with much
Esteem,</P>

<P>By another good Hand from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> of the 25th of
<HI>June</HI> 1683, I am told, that Mr. <HI>West</HI> the Lawyer, and
Collonel <HI>Ramsey,</HI> had sur∣rendered themselves, and have been
examined, and confessed the whole Design of killing the King and Duke, at
their late coming from <HI>New∣market,</HI> of which by God's Providence they
were disappointed. It is certain, a more diaboli∣cal Design could never be
contrived, and the Ex∣aminations already taken do plainly bring it to Light.
Yesterday the Council met, and a Pro∣clamation was ordered to be forthwith
issued out, to tell all the World, that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the
Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Armstrong,</HI> and one
<HI>Ferguson,</HI> are of the Number of the Conspira∣tors, and 500
<HI>L.</HI> is offered to such as shall bring in any of them. If the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> be guilty of this Crime, sure it is in him more than
High Treason, to which the greatest Pu∣nishments of human Laws are
assigned. Col∣lonel <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI> is sent to the
<HI>Tower</HI> for <PB N="344" REF="364"/> conspiring the Death of the King.
The Lord <HI>Russel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Trenchard</HI> are likewise sent
to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and Major <HI>Wildman</HI> is taken into Custody, in
whose Lodgings two small Field-Pieces were found, altho' he declared at his
being taken, he had no Arms in his House; and hereupon Orders were sent out
to disarm all dissaffected Persons, and a Committee of Lords were
sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> to examine Collonel <HI>Sidney.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Grey</HI> was carrying to the <HI>Tower,</HI> who
made his Escape just at the <HI>Tower</HI> Gate, out of the Coach from the
Sergeant at Arms, who was all alone with him and his Servant. He went directly
to the Water Side, and passed over into <HI>Southwark.</HI> The Sergeant
was asleep, or what is as bad, consenting to it. He refu∣sed to have a
Guard of Soldiers, and will be prosecuted with all Severity. Major
<HI>Holmes,</HI> an <HI>Oliverian</HI> Officer, and one Mr. <HI>Baillie,</HI> a
<HI>Scotchman,</HI> are sent to the <HI>Gate-house</HI> for Trea∣son; and
<HI>Hone</HI> the Joyner is also seized, who hath been examined: And tho'
he would not accuse others, he hath confessed enough to hang himself.
The Conspiracy is confirmed by all, but especially by Mr. <HI>Blaney,</HI>
who was privy to most of their Intrigues. His Majesty hath given Leave to
the Lady <HI>Russel</HI> to see her Husband in the <HI>Tower.</HI> The
Escape of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with some others of the
Conspirators, is confirmed by Letters from <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> being
embarqued on a Dogger Boat, with one <HI>Lock</HI> a rigid Presbyterian, who 
<PB N="345" REF="365"/> was Master of her. <HI>Mead,</HI> an Independant
Minister, with Six more, is brought from <HI>Essex. Mead</HI> is said
to have administred a Sacrament of Secrecy to the Conspirators, and one
<HI>Bourn,</HI> who is said to be one of those that were to give the fatal
Blow.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and several of the
Common Council, did in an humble Address to the King and his Royal
Highness, congratulate their Delivery from the late Conspiracy: The same
did Mr. <HI>North</HI> from <HI>Southwark,</HI> Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> from the
<HI>Middle Temple,</HI> Sir <HI>John Churchill,</HI> and Mr. <HI>James
Butler</HI> from <HI>Lincolns Inn.</HI> It is said, that Sir <HI>Thomas
Jones,</HI> one of the Judges of the King's Bench, will be made Lord Chief
Justice in the Place of Sir <HI>Edmund Sanders.</HI></P>

<P>The Grand Jury of <HI>London</HI> have found Bill of Indictment
against these Persons following <HI>Thomas Walcot, Richard Goodenough,
Richard</HI> <PB N="347" REF="369"/> <HI>Rumbold, Nathaniel Wade, Richard

of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Arm∣strong</HI>; and accordingly
<HI>Walcot, Rouse, Hone,</HI> and <HI>Blague,</HI> were arraigned
immediately; and <HI>Walcot</HI> Being brought to his Tryal, after a long
Hearing, was found Guilty of High Treason by the Jury. He confess'd he was
not to have killed the King, but had engaged himself to oppose the Guards.
This Morning, being the 13th of <HI>July,</HI> the Lord <HI>Russel</HI> and
<HI>Hone</HI> the Joyner, were brought to their Tryal, and found Guilty of High
Treason. At the same time the King being visiting a Fortification that
was making in the <HI>Tower,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> withdrawing
into his Closet, cut his own Throat with his Razor, of which he died
im∣mediately.</P>
<P>The 14th of <HI>July</HI> the Privy Council met, and the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen attending, were sent for into the Council, and
the Lord Chancellor told them, That the King had taken Notice of the irregular
Proceeding of the Common Hall about the Election of She∣riffs, and the great
Disorders occasioned there∣by; and that, for the Prevention of farther
Mischief, his Majesty did command the Lord Mayor to begin the whole
Proceeding <HI>de novo,</HI> and that his Lordship should take great Care
to maintain the ancient Customs of the City. <PB N="348" REF="370"/> Whereupon
the Common Hall meeting, the Order of Council was read, and my Lord Mayor told
them, That, in Obedience to it, they were to begin their whole Proceedings
<HI>de novo,</HI> and accordingly Mr. <HI>North</HI> was put up to be
confirm'd, and the Lord Mayor declared him one of the Sheriffs. Then they were
to go to the Poll, which Sheriff <HI>Chute</HI> declared they did with a
<HI>salvo Jure</HI> to their former Choice, and the Sheriffs had made a
Column in their Poll Bill, to Poll negatively against Mr. <HI>North</HI>'s
Confirmation, with which the Lord Mayor was so unsatisfied, that he
ad∣journed the Poll till the next Day, intending then his own Officers to take
the Poll.</P>
<P>The 20th of <HI>July, Walcot, Hone,</HI> and <HI>Rouse</HI>
were executed at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> the first of them most remarkably
penitent, and hath made a Decla∣ration under his Hand of many more Particu∣lars
of his own and others Guilt in this hor∣rid Conspiracy, than hath been yet
imputed to them. To morrow, the Lord <HI>Russel</HI> will lose his Head
in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</HI> of which I had this following Account from a
very good Hand at <HI>Whitehall. On</HI> Saturday <HI>the Lord</HI> Russel
<HI>was brought to the Place of his Execu∣tion in his own Coach, accompanied
with Dr.</HI> Tillotson <HI>and Dr.</HI> Burnet. <HI>He behaved himself
with great Courage. The Execution being ended, a Speech was published by his
La∣dy's Direction, wherein were several Reflecti∣ons defaming the Justice
of the Nation; and Dr.</HI> Burnet <HI>being suspected to have had a
Hand</HI> <PB N="349" REF="371"/> <HI>in it, he was examined before the Council
about it; and one</HI> Johnson, <HI>the late Lord</HI> Russel<HI>'s
Chaplain, was examined, as well about the said Speech, as for some
Passages in the Life of</HI> Julian the Apostate, <HI>whereof he was the
Author. A Declaration containing an Account of the Rise and Progress of the
present Conspiracy, hath been read and approved in Council, and in
pursuance of it, the</HI> 9<HI>th of</HI> September <HI>is appointed a Day of
solemn Thanksgiving in all Churches, for so great a Deliverance.</HI> At
the same time I am, told from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that Prince <HI>George</HI>
of <HI>Denmark</HI> was arrived; that he was a Person of a good Mein, and had
dined with the King, Queen, and Duke, who gave the Prince the upper Hand. The
Court will soon return to <HI>Windsor,</HI> where the Marriage between the
Prince and Lady <HI>Anne</HI> will be consummated. His Presents (which are
very noble) are pre∣sented to her, and their Families will be settled after
the Manner of the Duke's and Dutchess's, but not so numerous. A Chapter
will be held at <HI>Windsor</HI> for chusing Prince <HI>George</HI> into
the most noble Order of the Garter; but the Prince hath desired it may be
deferred, till he hath written to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> for his Leave
to forbear wearing the Order of the Elephant, for that it would not be seemly
to wear that and the Order of the Garter at the same time.</P>
<P>The King's Declaration concerning the Plot gives great
Satisfaction, wherein the particular Steps and Methods of it were set down;
and <PB N="350" REF="372"/> Mr. <HI>Carlton,</HI> who is named in the King's
De∣claration, is brought up from <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> where he was seized;
and being very intimate with the late Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> he hath been
ex∣amined by the Council, and is still in the Mes∣senger's Hands, and is
putting in Writing what he knows of the Conspiracy, which is expected to be
very considerable, because of his known Intimacy with the late Earl. The
present Earl, and the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> his Son (who is a very hopeful
young Gentleman) have kissed the King's Hand at <HI>Windsor.</HI> The
King hath de∣sired his Royal Highness to forbear Hunting this Season, it
not being safe for him at this time, when such villainous Designs are
disco∣vered against his Life. One Major <HI>Creed,</HI> and Major
<HI>Gladman,</HI> two <HI>Oliverian</HI> Officers, are both seized upon
Account of this Conspiracy. Mr. <HI>Speake</HI> of <HI>Somersetshire</HI>
is also seized, and continues in the Custody of one of the King's
Messengers; and Mr. <HI>Hawkins</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> a great
Confidant of the late Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> hath been taken and examined
before the Lords of the Council, and hath since had his Liberty upon Bail.
The <HI>Marquis de Tilladet,</HI> and the <HI>Marquis de la Fare,</HI> were
sent by the <HI>French</HI> King and the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> to
congratulate with his Majesty and his Royal Highness, upon the Discovery
of this Conspiracy. The King sends the Earl of <HI>Dumbarton</HI> and the
Duke, and Mr. <HI>Nichols</HI> of the Bedchamber, to con∣dole with the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur last private Letter, as well as your publick one, were
read before his Majesty yesterday in Council. Your Answers to the
Go∣vernour were well approved of, especially that Article wherein you
observed to him, That it is out of the Sphere of any foreign Ministers, to
take upon them to alledge, or make use of any Argument grounded upon the
Sentiment or De∣sires of the Subjects and Vassals of the Prince 
<PB N="352" REF="374"/> that a foreign Minister so alledging resides with:
For Example, would the King of <HI>Spain</HI> have taken it well, that Sir
<HI>Henry Goodrick</HI> should have urged, why he offered his Majesty's
Arbi∣trage, the Sentiments or Desires of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation,
either in their Provinces, or else in other Territories of the Catholick
King? Can <HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos</HI> make it out, that the City of
<HI>London</HI> does desire, that his Majesty should embark in a War?
Does he know the Sentiments of the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>Ire∣land?</HI> Hath he put all the Sentiments of those great Bodies into
a Balance? Does he know which amongst them will preponderate? There was a
Time (and 'tis within your Memory and mine) when not only foreign Ministers
with Character, but their very Clerks and <HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> did meddle
with our Affairs of State, and might (as they thought) with our publick
Councils. This was an Indignity upon the King, I hope it will be so no more.
Sure I am of one thing, they did not do our Business, which they pretended
highly to do; if they have done their own, much good may it do them. You have
already all the Account I can give you of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
saving that yesterday Evening, after Council, he came to my Office, and I
discharged the Sergeant at Arms that had him in Custody: Then I waited upon
him, as I had been ordered, to the Duke: The Duke car∣ried him immediately to
the King. After his Examination, the King carried him to the Queen. Then the
Duke brought him back again to his <PB N="353" REF="375"/> own Side, to the
Dutchess, and he was all this Morning at Court. I am, Sir,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>It seems, the Lord Privy Seal, the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI>
and several other Lords of the Privy Council, knowing for certain, that the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was at Court, and had been well received and pardoned
by the King, went to visit the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> at the
<HI>Cock-pit</HI>; and some People had the Confidence to contra∣dict what was
published concerning the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> tho' nothing was printed
con∣cerning him, but by Order from the King, and Council, and entered
<HI>verbatim</HI> in the Council Book, that it might be kept in particular.
However, what was printed concerning the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> was the
Subject of much Discourse, and the Whiggs and factious People had the
Impudence to say it was false, and that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did
not make any Con∣fession of the Conspiracy; and the Thing went so far,
that Reports were spread abroad, of Discourses the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> had himself held to that Purpose, and that the printed
Re∣lation was injurious to him; so that there was a Necessity that some
publick Notice should be taken of it, and that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
should vindicate the King's Honour as well as his own, by owning publickly
the Confession he had made to the King, in Presence of his Royal
Highness, with which his Majesty was so well <PB N="354" REF="376"/>
pleased, as not only to grant him his Pardon, which was to pass forthwith
under the Great Seal, but likewise gave him a considerable Sum of Money for
the Frankness of his Confession. But upon the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
denying what was published concerning him, and ha∣ving declared the same in
divers publick Places, and the Persons being sent for and examined, they
declared, That they heard the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> himself deny that he
had made any such Confession of the Conspiracy; and the Factious
thereupon beginning to shew them∣selves with great Confidence, it was
thought absolutely necessary, that publick Notice should be taken of
it. Whereupon the King required the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to make a publick
De∣claration either before the Council, or else to confess publickly what
he had declared and owned to his Majesty, when he was first brought to the
King by his Royal Highness: But the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> then having his
Pardon un∣der the Great Seal, and the Money which the King gave him, did
absolutely refuse to con∣form to what his Majesty so justly required
of him, and which the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> should not have made the
least Scruple of doing. The King was so highly offended at the Duke's
re∣fusing to perform so necessary a Part of his Du∣ty, that he
forthwith ordered Mr. Vice-Cham∣berlain <HI>Saville,</HI> to signify to him
his Majesty's Pleasure, That he should not any more come into the King's
Presence, and that he should presently leave the Court; which the Duke 
<PB N="355" REF="377"/> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did, and took a little House in
<HI>Holbourn,</HI> to the Astonishment of all Men that had any Duty for the
King or Government. Upon this the Whiggs and factious People made it the great
Subject of all their Discourses: Whereupon the King was pleased to
declare publickly, That the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did confess to him, in
Presence of the Duke, all the Plot, and did repeat to him all the
conside∣rable Particulars sworn by the Witnesses, and did assure
the King, that what the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>Escrick</HI> had sworn
against <HI>Algernoon Sidney,</HI> was true; and that he was one of the
most dangerous Men to the Government in his Ma∣jesty's Dominions: And yet,
at the same time, several Persons of Credit deposed, That they had
heard the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> disown what was published about him,
and refused to make a publick Declaration of what he had confessed and
owned to the King.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the King was pleased to ac∣quaint the Lords
of his Council, That having received the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> into his
Mer∣cy, and having since heard several Reports from the Duke's own Servants
and others, that the Duke had made no Confession to his Majesty of the
Conspiracy, nor owned any Share he had in it: The King did therefore think
fit, for the Vindication of the Truth of what the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had
declared to him and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> to require the same from him
in wri∣ting a Letter under his own Hand, which the said Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> refused to do in the Terms <PB N="356" REF="378"/> it was
commanded him: His Majesty was so much offended therewith, that he had
forbid him his Presence, and commanded him to depart the Court: And for the
farther Information of the Council, his Majesty had directed the Letter that
the Duke had been required to sign, to be entered in the Council Book,
declaring he did not intend it should be a Secret. The Letter was as
follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Have heard some Reports of me, as if I should have
lessened the late Plot, and have gone about to discredit the Evidence
against those that have died by Justice. Your Majesty and the Duke know
how ingenuously I have owned the late Conspiracy; and tho' I was not
conscious of any Design against your Majesty's Life, yet I lament the
having a great Hand in the other Part of the Conspiracy, which was the
Confederacy. Sir, I have taken the Liberty to put this in Wri∣ting, for my own

<P>The King having made this Declaration con∣cerning the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> to the Council, caused it to be entered in the Council
Book, <PB N="357" REF="379"/> that Copies might be taken of it, which gave a
general and great Satisfaction; whereas many before began to be staggered
with the Reports that were with so much Confidence, or rather Impudence,
spread abroad; and the great Won∣der was, why the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
should refuse to give the King and the World the Sa∣tisfaction of signing
the above-written Paper. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> declared upon going from
his House in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> that he would re∣tire privately to his
House in <HI>Moore Park,</HI> but none know (at least publickly) where he
now is; and I have been told from a good Hand at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that he
had written a submissive Let∣ter to the King, but not being in the Terms
his Majesty expected, he would take no Notice of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI> will executed the next Week, the
Warrant being signed for his Execution, and the Lord Chief Justice hath
committed two Persons to <HI>Newgate,</HI> for using some scandalous
Expressions concerning Mr. <HI>Sid∣ney</HI>'s Tryal and Jury, it being fit
that some should be made Examples, to teach others to govern their Tongues.
On the 7th of <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sidney</HI> was beheaded. He came on
Foot from the <HI>Tower</HI> to the Scaffold upon <HI>Tower Hill</HI>: He there
saluted the People, and gave the Sheriffs a Paper, which he desired might
be communicated to the World; and kneeling down, he prayed to himself for
some Minutes, and then rising undressed himself. The She∣riffs
asked him, if he had nothing to say? who <PB N="358" REF="380"/> answered,
he had nothing to say or to do, but to die: And being undressed, and
putting on his Cap, he laid himself down, and bid the Executioner do his
Duty, who struck off his Head at one Blow. The Sheriffs carried the Paper to
the King, which was an Invective against the Government, his Judges, Jury,
and Witnesses, and concludes with this Expression, That he <HI>doubts
not but God Almighty will con∣tinue to own the Cause for which he died.</HI>
He shewed a great Courage and Unconcernedness for Death; but it is to be
wished he had shewed a more Christian Temper. He had no Minister with
him, having a Religion of his own, and his Paper may be justly called, a very
venemous Libel: He seems to justify the last Rebellion, and prayed God
still to support the Old Cause, for which he appeared so eminently
heretofore. It is certain, that he carried his detestable Princi∣ples
against Monarchy and the established Go∣vernment with him to his Grave,
and gloried in his treasonable Actions and Practices, rather than repented of
them. The Paper he gave the Sheriffs will not be printed; it begins thus:
<HI>Men, Brethren, and Fathers, Friends, Country∣men, and Strangers</HI>; and
having justified his own Book, and exclaimed against the Proceed∣ings at
his Tryal, it ends thus: <HI>By these means am I brought hither; the Lord
forgive their Practices, and avert the Evils which threaten the Nation from
them! Lord sanctify these my Sufferings unto me! and tho' I fall a
Sacrifice to Idols, suffer not Idolatry to be established in</HI> 
<PB N="359" REF="381"/> <HI>the Land. Bless thy People, and save them:
Defend thy own Cause; defend them that defend it: Stir up such as are
faint, direct such as are willing, confirm such as waver, give Wisdom and
Integrity to All: Order all things so as they may redound to thy Glory; and
grant I may die glorifying thee for all thy Mercies, and for that thou hast
at last permitted me to be singled out as a Witness of thy Truth, and
even by the Con∣fession of my Opposers, for <HI REND="blackletterType">The
Old Cause,</HI> for which thou hast so often and so wonderfully
declared thy self.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Mayor of <HI>York</HI> is summoned to answer before
the Council several High Misde∣meanours charged against him; and having
appeared before the Council, he was obliged to give Bail to answer the
Information that shall be exhibited against him by Mr. Attorney Ge∣neral.

all the Re∣lations that were written and printed concerning him. I have only
one thing to observe to you in the whole Transaction of that Business,

Answer to it by Word of Mouth, to <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> but strictly
commanded not to give it in Writing, or to dictate it, that he might take a

<P>In the Beginning of the Year following, the Court of King's
Bench gave Judgment in the great Case of the <HI>East India</HI> Company,
and were unanimously of Opinion, that Judgment ought to be given for the
Plaintiffs, which are the <HI>East India</HI> Company. Their Arguments were
all resolved into these two Questions: First, Whether the Grant of a
sole Trade to the Company, without Prohibition to all the rest of the
King's Subjects not to trade to those Parts, be a good Grant? Secondly,
Suppose the Grant be good, whether this Action be maintainable? And the whole
Court held in the Affirmative to both: And, that in the First Point, as well
the prohibitory as the enabling Part, were consistent both with the Laws of
the Land, and the Law of Nations: Which the Lord Chief Justice made out with
much painful Learning, by citing many Authorities and Precedents out of the
Parliament Rolls and foreign Books, whereby he proved that <HI>Jus Gentium</HI>
must be the Judge of foreign Trade, <PB N="367" REF="389"/> by which it was at
first established, as it is re∣gulated in all other Nations. As to the
Obje∣ction, that this excluding Grant was a Mono∣poly, he distinguished
upon the Word, proving out of several Books of the Civil Law, that Monopolies
are of two Sorts, either Lawful, as when the Prince grants to any College a
sole Trade exclusive of all other Persons: Or Un∣lawful, according to the
vulgar Acceptation of the Word; and that this Grant is of the for∣mer Sort, and
not such a Monopoly as the Law condemns. The Court held, That the Statute of
<HI>Edw.</HI> III. pleaded by the Defendant, had Relation only to the Trade of
the Staple, and could not be intended to controul this, which was not then in
Being. Yet, supposing the Sta∣tute were powerful, and gave Licence to all
Persons to trade every where; yet the King having, by the common Law, a Power
of re∣straining his Subjects from trading, and there being no express Words
in the Statute, to take away this Power, the Statute, as to that, is void,
according to the Rule set down by my Lord <HI>Cook,</HI> that, without
express Words, no Prerogative shall be taken away. The Court said
further, That tho' the King had covenan∣ted with the Company, to grant no
Licences to any other Persons of a concurrent Trade; yet the King hath not
hereby concluded him∣self, but that he may, at his Pleasure, license any
of his Subjects to trade to the Places men∣tioned in the Charter.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="390"/>This being a Matter of Curiosity, I give
you this particular Account for your Satisfaction.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your last, which was read yesterday before the King and
Council, you are pleased to de∣sire to know the King's Pleasure, whether
you should go into the Campaign with that Governour. His Majesty
resolved, that it was not necessary, because the Scene of the War in
that Country being like to be of a very narrow Compass, and not far from the
Place where you have always resided, which being the Capital of that
Coun∣try, will still have the best Share in the Intelli∣gence. One thing
that concerns my self I shall take Leave to impart to you with a very
sincere Joy: It is, That his Majesty hath, upon my most humble, and even
importunate Suit, given me Leave, in regard of my ill Health, to resign my
Post of Secretary, and hath bestowed it up∣on Mr. <HI>Godolphin,</HI> in
whose Correspondence, as far as it will take in your Deportment, you will,
I am sure, be very happy. My great Concern is, that this being a pure Effect
of my most hum∣ble Supplication, and even intolerable Importu∣nity with his
Majesty and the Duke, it may not be imputed to any Surprize upon me at Court,
much less to my disliking of the present Measures there. This I say,
because I know the Fanaticks will put the most malicious Constructions
they can invent upon an Incident at Court: But, up∣on my honest Word, Sir, it
is my utter Disabi∣lity to serve, and that alone, which hath pre∣vailed
upon his Majesty's infinite Clemency and Goodness, to consent to my
Dismission, with such <PB N="373" REF="395"/> Marks of his Grace and
Royal Bounty, as to me are unexpressible. This I thought it my Duty to
impart to you, to prevent Misinformation, and to let you know, at the same

being Principal Secretary of State, I had the following Letter from him, dated

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have often pitied you very heartily, under the intolerable
Pains you take, in writing so many Letters with your own Hand. I must now,
in Conscience, not only pray you, but in a manner require you, to ease your
self of writing any longer to me, and I shall reckon my Obliga∣tion no
less than if you did this. His Majesty allows me the Honour of Access, as
before, to the Committee of Foreign Affairs; so that as often as I go
thither, I shall be sure to meet with your Intelligence; and when my Health
does not give me Leave to do so, my Friends are pleased to communicate unto
me so much as serves my Turn. But if at anytime your own Occasions invite
you to write to me, I pray do it very freely; for in those Matters you may
command me still, as, Sir,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="376" REF="398"/>The 20th of <HI>May</HI> 1684, I had this
following Letter from a very good Hand.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am sure that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador hath
been spoken to, concerning the Treatment which they gave the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> at <HI>Brussels,</HI> and has been given to understand
the great Resentment the King hath of their Pro∣ceedings. Hereupon the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador has taken an Occasion to speak to the
King, assuring him, that the Civilities which were shewed him at
<HI>Brussels,</HI> were purely in respect to his Majesty, as being his
Son; of which I am told the King took hold, and hath caused a Letter to be
written to the Ambassador, to let that Court know the little Satisfaction
his Ma∣jesty hath in their treating the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI> as they
have done; and yet the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador continues his
Instances, tho' he knows they cannot succeed to his Satisfaction. For he
that asketh a Thing that cannot be granted, without the great Prejudice of
him that is to grant it, cannot certainly think to obtain what he desires,
and has not so much Cause to be dis∣satisfied, when refused, as he
hath, of whom he desires a Thing to his Prejudice. I suppose it will be
no News to tell you, that the <HI>French</HI> King hath given Assurances,
that after the Ta∣king of <HI>Luxenburgh,</HI> he will not attempt any thing
farther in <HI>Flanders.</HI> The <HI>Count d'Araux</HI> hath declared thus
much at the <HI>Hague,</HI> upon <PB N="377" REF="399"/> which it is not doubted
but the <HI>States</HI> will re∣solve to sit still, and let the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> manage the War, as they will, if they will not comply with
the <HI>French</HI> Proposals. We have no News from my Lord
<HI>Dartmouth</HI> at <HI>Tangier,</HI> expecting that he is coming home, and
will be speedily in <HI>England.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> is highly
caressed at the <HI>Hague,</HI> which would make me wonder what the Prince
of <HI>Orange</HI> aims at by such a Proceeding. The King was pleased to
de∣clare in the last Council at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> that he thought fit
that his Royal Highness should be present at the Meeting of the Council,
and ac∣cordingly the Duke took his Place at the Board, as First Prince of the
Blood.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I am told from a good Hand, that the King hath forbid all
Correspondence with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and hath declared to the
Nobility, and others attending him, that they should hold no Commerce with
the Prince, who hath given the old <HI>Hoffe,</HI> where the Princess his
Grandmother lived, at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> We
expect daily a publick Ac∣count of the Discovery lately made in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> it being as plain as the Day, that the Conspi∣racy was
so laid between the Rebels here and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to make an
Insurrection in both Kingdoms at the same time; upon which many Gentlemen,
whom they call Lairds, are com∣mitted to Prison; it appearing that the
Design of the Conspiracy was to have surprized <HI>Berwick,</HI> and
thereby have opened their Way to <HI>New-castle.</HI> <PB N="378" REF="400"/>
By the Deposition of one <HI>Carstairs,</HI> who was taken in
<HI>England,</HI> and sent to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by several others, the
Correspondence is made so plain between the Conspirators here and in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> that there is no farther Doubt made of it, it being
sufficiently made appear. But at the same time it is worthy Remark, that
all their Credit in <HI>Scotland</HI> could not raise Thirty Thousand
Pounds to carry on their Plot. I am told from a good Hand, that
<HI>Danvers</HI> who is now in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> was the Author of that
damna∣ble Libel about the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> being a Parcel of Lies
and Forgeries maliciously put together, to perswade the Whiggs and the
Ignorant, that the then Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was murdered by Order from
the Government, when it was apparent that he cut his own Throat. Circular
Letters have been written by the King's Commands, to all the Lords Lieutenants
of the Counties of this Kingdom, to this Effect: That the King being informed
Reports were spread abroad in the Country, that his Majesty intended to
call a Parliament, and that many Gentlemen have thereupon begun to make
Interests to be cho∣sen, his Majesty had thought fit to let them know,
that he has not at present any Intention to call a Parliament; and when he
shall find it ne∣cessary for his Service and the publick Good, to call
one, he will cause timely Notice to be given thereof; and in the mean time,
commands them to take Care to suppress all such false Reports, and to
punish the Authors of them. And his Majesty being informed, that Endeavours
have <PB N="379" REF="401"/> been used to promote a tumultuary Petition for
the Sitting of Parliament, his Majesty com∣mands them to crush such
seditious Practices, tending to the great Disturbance of the Go∣vernment
and the publick Peace, and to enquire for the Authors and Promoters of
them.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>London</HI> about Sixty Companies, of which
Fourty and more have already sur∣rendered their Charters to his Majesty,
who hath been pleased to grant them new ones, with such Alterations and
Limitations as the King thinks necessary for his Service; and those
Companies which do yet stand out, will be proceeded against in another
Way.</P>
<P>I am told from a very good Hand at <HI>White∣hall,</HI> by
Letter of the 13th of <HI>June</HI> 1684, That the Duke's Counsel let Mr.
<HI>Oates</HI> in the <HI>King's Bench</HI> Prison know, that there was a
Declaration filed against him on the Part of the Duke, for false and
scandalous Words, and that if he pleaded not, Judgment should be entered
against him by Default. He replied, according to his insolent Manner, That,
as he had never loved the Duke, so he did not fear him, and that he would
answer the Declara∣tion when he thought fit; and that, for the entering
Judgment by Default, he could not, for he would stay in Prison, till there
was a Parliament, and then he should come out, and others would be in his
Place. Upon this, the Duke's Counsel moved at the King's Bench Bar, That if
<HI>Oates</HI> suffered Judgment to be entered by Default, in this Action of
the Duke, the <PB N="380" REF="402"/> Court would then grant a Writ of Enquiry
of Damages to be executed at the Bar. The Aim of the Duke's Counsel in
desiring this, is, that the Matter they charge <HI>Oates</HI> with may be
laid open to the World, by having the Witnesses examined in open Court.</P>
<P>The Yacht that brought over Sir <HI>Thomas Armstrong</HI>
being arrived at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> he was brought on Shore by Captain
<HI>Richardson,</HI> the Keeper of <HI>Newgate,</HI> who put Shackles upon
him, and brought him to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where he hath been examined by a
Committee of Lords, but would confess nothing. It seems Mr.
<HI>Chud∣leigh</HI> having Notice, that Seven or Eight <HI>Eng∣lishmen</HI>
were come to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> he sent his Secretary, who discovered them
at <HI>Delft,</HI> and followed them to <HI>Leyden</HI>; and having lodged them
there, he applied himself to the Scout, in Pursuance of an Order Mr.
<HI>Chudleigh</HI> had obtained some time before of the States; and having
the Scout's Assistance, he went to the House where they were, and
seized <HI>Armstrong</HI> without any Opposition. The others with him
were not meddled with, for that they were not mentioned in the Order of the
States. <HI>Armstrong</HI> was carried to Mr. <HI>Chudleigh</HI>'s House at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> and from thence on board the Yacht at <HI>Rotterdam.</HI>
Since his coming to <HI>London,</HI> he hath been brought to the King's Bench,
where Execution was prayed against him: But he pleaded a Statute of
<HI>Edward</HI> VI. which says, if a Person outlawed yield himself within
a Year and Day, he shall be admitted to a Tryal: <PB N="381" REF="403"/> But
he was answered, he did not yield him∣self, but was brought in by Force,
and so could not claim the Benefit of that Statute. He re∣plied, the King had
allowed <HI>Holloway</HI> (who was likewise outlawed) the Liberty to
reverse the Outlawry, and to stand a Tryal, and hoped he should not be
denied it. He was answered by the Judges, that was the King's particular
Grace and Mercy, of which they were not the Dispensers; and that there
remained nothing for them to do, but to order his Execution, which they did
accordingly. He did not seem inclined to make any Confession, nor to have
the Sense that a Man ought to have that had Guilt upon him. After this, a
Motion was made on his Behalf, in the Court of Chancery, for a Writ of Error to
reverse the Outlawry: But my Lord Keeper answered, he could not grant it
without Mr. Attorney's Consent, who said he had no Directions to consent
to it. One would think Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> ought not to expect any Mercy or
Favour from the King, to whom he hath been so ungrateful. But I must not
for∣get to tell you, that when he was taken, he dropt some Papers into a
House of Office, but they were found, and amongst them were Let∣ters from
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to the Sieur <HI>Dien,</HI> the
<HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Minister at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and another to one of
the States, recommend∣ing Sir <HI>Thomas Armstrong</HI> to them in the most
pressing Manner imaginable. He was executed at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> drawn
thither from <HI>Newgate</HI> upon a Sledge. He saluted several People as
he <PB N="382" REF="404"/> went. He had Dr. <HI>Tennison</HI> to pray with
him, and died with much Courage and Resolution. His Head will be put up over
the <HI>Gate-house</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and his Quarters will be
dis∣posed of in like manner. One of his Quarters will be sent to
<HI>Stafford,</HI> for which Place he was a Burgess in Parliament. By his
Paper which he gave the Sheriff, he justifies his In∣nocency, and complains
that he had not a Tryal.</P>
<P>After Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Execution, the Paper he gave the
Sheriffs was first brought to the King, and his Majesty gave it again to
the Sheriffs, with Liberty to publish it. In it he disowns to know of any
Plot against the King's Person and Government, and asserts his
Innocency to those Matters. He justified himself of what was reported of
him, of betraying the King in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Time. He declared, he died a
Mem∣ber of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but confessed he had not lived
according to her Rules and Doctrines. He said, he died justly for the ma∣ny
Sins he had committed in his Life-time, and desired those he had injured to
forgive him, as he forgave every Body.</P>
<P>About this time was <HI>Oates</HI>'s, Tryal with the Duke, where
no less than Ten Witnesses swore, That <HI>Oates</HI> had said, his
Royal Highness was <HI>a Traitor, a Rascal, a Devil, the Son of a
Whore,</HI> with other Words not fit to be named, were it not to shew the
audacious Insolence of <HI>Oates,</HI> who may possibly e'er long be
called to an Account for many other things. Mr. <HI>Wil∣liams,</HI> 
<PB N="383" REF="405"/> late Speaker of the House of Commons, had a
Declaration filed against him, for having caused several Papers, called
Votes and Ad∣dresses of the House of Commons, to be prin∣ted and
published, wherein were many scan∣dalous Reflections upon his Majesty and
his Government; of which the said Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> having Notice, he did
not appear in <HI>Westmin∣ster-hall</HI> the last Day of the Term, which
he never missed before.</P>
<P>I was told from a good Hand at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> by Letters of
the 30th of <HI>June</HI> 1684, That the Lord Treasurer of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
with several other Lords of that Kingdom, were come to the <HI>English</HI>
Court, to complain against the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland:</HI> That the King
and Duke had heard their Complaints, which they found so well grounded, that
the Great Seal was taken from the Chancellor, whose Name is Sir <HI>George
Gordon,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> was constituted Lord Chancellor
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Place he had of Justice General was given to
the Earl of <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> Collonel of the Guards, and the said
Regiment of Guards was given to Collonel <HI>Douglas,</HI> Brother to the Lord
Treasurer, the Marquess of <HI>Queensborough,</HI> who has at present a
<HI>Scotch</HI> Regiment in Service of the States General; and Matters being
thus settled, the Lords are returning home again very well satisfied.</P>
<P>I am told by a good Hand from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> That Sir
<HI>Gabriel Sylvius</HI> being returning for <HI>Holland,</HI> is charged with
a Message from the <PB N="384" REF="406"/> King to the Prince of
<HI>Orange:</HI> That the King considering the ill Circumstances that
Prince had put himself into, the King had writ late∣ly to the Prince, to
assure him of his Kindness, and that he would do all he could to
support him. To which the Person that writes tells me, that the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> returned a very cold and indifferent Answer; and which is
much wondered at, that the Prince should shew such Kindness to the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and the Lord <HI>Brandon,</HI> which neither the King nor
Duke can take well from the Prince. I am told from the same Hand, That the
King had taken Notice to the Envoy of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> of the great
Respect and Kindness which is shewed to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> at
<HI>Berlin</HI>; and his Majesty was pleased to say, he did not think the
Elector would have given that Coun∣tenance to one that was in his Disfavour.
But the Minister, to excuse the Elector, said his Electoral Highness,
in the Respect he had shewed to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> did it as to
his Majesty's Son, and not to him as Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>; who is so
highly caressed at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that it is thought the Prince will
make him General of all the <HI>English</HI> Forces, and of all other his
Majesty's Subjects that are in the States Service; with which his Majesty
is so highly dissatisfied, that, perhaps, at Mr. <HI>Chud∣leigh</HI>'s
Return to the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Majesty's Re∣sentment may appear more
publick.</P>
<P>I am told, there hath lately happened a very unlucky Accident at
<HI>Norwich,</HI> betwixt <PB N="385" REF="407"/> Mr. <HI>Bedingfield</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Barney</HI>; the first a Man of a very good Estate, and the other
an ancient Baronet; and some Words having passed between them at a
Gentleman's House, <HI>Barney</HI> came behind <HI>Bedingfield,</HI> and
stabbed him in the Back, of which he died presently. The Sessions being
then there, he was tryed, con∣victed, and condemned, and was executed at the
Market Cross, the Fact being so foul, that all Sollicitations for his Life
were ineffectual. I am told from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that the King had named
Mr. <HI>Brisbane,</HI> late Secretary of the Ad∣miralty, to go in Quality of
his Majesty's En∣voy Extraordinary to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in the
Room of Mr. <HI>Fanshaw,</HI> who was recalled; but Mr. <HI>Brisbane</HI>
falling sick at <HI>Windsor,</HI> is since dead.</P>
<P>By Letters of the 25th of <HI>August,</HI> 1684, I am told,
that the King had thought fit to re∣move the Earl of <HI>Radnor</HI> from the
President∣ship of the Council, his Majesty's Pleasure be∣ing therein
signified to his Lordship by a Let∣ter from the Secretary of State, with an
Assurance of the King's entire Satisfaction in his Services, and that his
Majesty, as a Mark of it, would continue to him his Pension which he had as
Lord President. The Lord <HI>Radnor</HI>'s Answer was full of Duty and
Sub∣mission to the King; who was so well pleased with it, that he
ordered the Lords of the Trea∣sury to take particular Care of the Payment of
the said Pension: And his Majesty caused the Earl of
<HI>Rochester</HI> to be sworn Lord Presi∣dent <PB N="386" REF="408"/> of
the Council; and also acquainted the Lords, that his Intention was, that Mr.
<HI>Godol∣phin</HI> should be made an <HI>English</HI> Baron, by the Name
of Baron <HI>Godolphin</HI> of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> and succeed the Lord
<HI>Rochester</HI> in the Place of First Commissioner of the
Treasury: That the Earl of <HI>Middleton,</HI> late one of the Secretaries of
State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> should succeed Mr. <HI>Godolphin</HI> in that
of Secretary of State of <HI>England,</HI> who was sworn accordingly; and
that the King had given the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> Sixteen Thousand
Pounds, to be raised out of the Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s Estate: Which Changes
were made by the King to the Satisfaction of all Parties concerned.</P>
<P>I was told from a good Hand at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that the Duke
of <HI>Grafton</HI> was gone incognito into <HI>Holland,</HI> and would from
thence go to <HI>Brussels,</HI> to meet with his Brother the Duke of
<HI>Northumberland,</HI> and then return together, after having seen the
Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and spoken with the Resident at
<HI>Brussels,</HI> which they both did, but could not perform what they
intended. The same Person told me, that the Discovery made in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> by the decy∣phering of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Letters, which were
owned by his Secretary, are of great Importance; which make the late horrid
Conspiracy so evi∣dent, that none can doubt of it. It seems this
Secretary was Prisoner in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was charged with a Letter
from <HI>Argyle,</HI> which was found about him when he was taken, and a
Person at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> did decypher it. The Se∣cretary at first
denied it; but after having se∣veral <PB N="387" REF="409"/> times endured the
Torture called the <HI>Boot,</HI> he had at last owned the Letter to be truly
de∣cyphered, and confessed several Particulars, which make the
Conspiracy as plain as Noon-Day. Upon this Discovery, the Laird of
<HI>Monroe</HI> and several others are apprehended in <HI>Scotland</HI>; and
<HI>Monroe</HI> being threatened with the Torture, hath confessed all, and
hath con∣firmed what was evidenced by others, designing to make an
Insurrection in <HI>Scotland</HI> at the same time it was to be in
<HI>England. Monroe</HI> is bring∣ing up to <HI>London,</HI> having made a very
large Confession. He hath attempted, with the Hor∣ror of his Guilt, to
destroy himself, and there∣fore is looked after more closely. After this
<HI>Monroe</HI>'s Arrival, <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Letters, and the Confession of
his Secretary and others, will be made publick, to convince World of the
hellish Designs of the Conspirators against the King and Government:
Tho' one would think there should be none that needs be convinced, after the
plain Proofs that have already been given of them. It appears, that the
Design of the Conspirators was to have surprized <HI>Berwick,</HI> and
thereby to have opened their Way to <HI>New∣castle,</HI> where the Plot hath
been also discove∣red: For the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Jeffries</HI> being
upon the Bench. Information was given him, that several considerable
Persons of that Town had signed an Association for reforming the
Abuses of the Government in Church and State: That the Original of this
Association was burnt, upon Discovery of the Plot against 
<PB N="388" REF="410"/> the King and Duke: But a Copy was produced to the Lord
Chief Justice, and one that signed the Original, swore it to be a true
Copy: Up∣on which Sixteen or Seventeen principal Per∣sons of that Place were
apprehended and com∣mitted to Prison for High Treason, before the
Assizes were there ended; and since the Lord Chief Justice
<HI>Jeffries</HI>'s Return, he hath given an Account thereof to the King: As
also, that many Corporations in his Circuit had submit∣ted their Charters
to such Alterations as his Majesty hath thought necessary for
securing the Government in good and loyal Hands. The City of <HI>York</HI> as
well as <HI>London,</HI> is now governed by Commission, their Charter being
seized into the King's Hands, who out of his natural Goodness will grant
them new Char∣ters. A <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> being sent down against the
Charter of the City of <HI>Exeter,</HI> they imme∣diately resolved to lay
their Charter at the King's Feet, and to make such a Resignation thereof as
his Majesty shall think fit: By which may be seen the general Duty of his
Majesty's Sub∣jects to his Royal Authority. A great Change in few Months!
which next to the good Provi∣dence of God, is to be attributed to his
Maje∣sty's great Prudence and Conduct.</P>
<P>The Lord Chief Justice <HI>Jeffries</HI> being re∣turned from
his Circuit, is gone to <HI>Winchester,</HI> to lay at his Majesty's Feet
several Charters that were surrendered to him in his Circuit, where most
Corporations have submitted to his Majesty's good Pleasure therein. Their
Ma∣jesties <PB N="389" REF="411"/> are returned from <HI>Winchester,</HI>
and their Royal Highnesses, with the Prince and Princess of
<HI>Denmark</HI> the Day before; the King and Duke, since the Discovery of
the Conspiracy, never travelling the same Day together.</P>
<P>This Week Mr. <HI>Rosewell,</HI> a Nonconformist Preacher,
was committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> having uttered treasonable Words, as he
was holding forth in a Conventicle. He will not be tryed at the <HI>Old
Baily,</HI> but at the King's Bench Bar, the next Term. The Words he is charged
with are very seditious and treasonable, and as well against the late
King as the present Government, and are proved by so many Witnesses,
that he is like to pass his Time very ill.</P>
<P>I must not forget to tell, that upon Mr. Se∣cretary
<HI>Jenkins</HI>'s laying down, with the King's Leave, his being Principal
Secretary of State, I was then put into the Province of the Earl of
<HI>Sunderland,</HI> who wrote me this following Letter, dated the 25th of
<HI>August,</HI> 1684, at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>About this time the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador in
<HI>England, Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</HI> took an Occasion to speak with
the King my Master in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Behalf, by Order from
the <HI>Marquis de Grana,</HI> then Governour of the <HI>Spanish
Netherlands,</HI> which produced a Letter from the King to the Marquis, which
was sent to me to deliver; wherein his Majesty let the Marquis know, how
much he was dis∣satisfied with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
Com∣portment, which I represented to his Excellen∣cy in the best Terms I
could: But the <HI>Marquis de Grana</HI> told me, he knew from whence the
King's Displeasure came, and that it was the Duke of <HI>York</HI> who was
the great Enemy of the Duke <PB N="391" REF="413"/> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> whom
the King loved as he did his Eyes, and endeavoured to perswade me to shew
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> great Civilities. I told his Excellency, that I
was absolutely to obey my Master, who had commanded me not to own him, and
at the same time had spoken to <HI>Don Pedro</HI> to represent to the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> his Master, in what ill Circumstances the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> stood with the King his Father.</P>
<P>It was a strange Ingratitude in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
who was in quiet Possession of all Places of Trust, Profit, or
Honour, which could make him either happy or serviceable for the Government,
or grateful to the People, to be engaged in a Conspiracy which was against
Religion, Morality, and the common Sense of Humanity, and the highest
Ingratitude to the King his Father, and even to Heaven it self. Certainly
this counterfeit <HI>Absalom</HI> took a Glo∣ry to exceed in Wickedness,
that no Man should be so infamous as himself; who with the Gracefulness
of his Person, with his Po∣pularity and other sinister and base
Artifices, had strangely insinuated himself amongst the worst of Men,
the common People; and be∣fore the Conspiracy broke out, he made some
Voyages into the Country, and addressed him∣self to the Populace, like
another <HI>Absalom,</HI> which went to his Royal Father's Heart. His
rebellious Son <HI>Absalom!</HI> who was no sooner gone from his Father's
Presence, but he endea∣voured to steal away the Hearts of his People, and
alienate the Affections of his Subjects from <PB N="392" REF="414"/> their
Obedience. His ambitious Son! whom no Preferments could content: His ungrateful
Son! with his artificial Submission at his Fa∣ther's Feet; but was no
sooner gone from his Presence, but denied all he had confessed: And yet
his royal and indulgent Father was willing to forget
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forgive all his Faults, if he
would but confess and acknowledge what he had done. But, <HI>Benefacere,
&amp; malum audire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> regium
est.</HI> It is too often the ill Fortune of Kings to be ill spoken of,
when they do best for their Sub∣jects Good. For after our blood-thirsty
<HI>English</HI> Rebels had murdered their late King, and brought the Nation
to great Confusion, which continued for some Years, when God was
mi∣raculously pleased to restore them to their an∣cient Government, by
sending them their own King: Yet were the People so ungrateful, that in
place of praising God for so great a Benefit, like the ancient
<HI>Jews,</HI> they complained and murmured at that very Time when God was
leading them into the Land of Promise, into Peace and Plenty; they wished
themselves back in <HI>Egypt,</HI> whining after their Leeks and Oni∣ons, and
desiring their former Slavery: Even so at this time, Conventicles, by their
leering Whines, and their melting Complaints, insinu∣ated the sad Times
that were coming, even the Coffee-houses croaked with the Noise of it, and
there came out every Day some compleat Arti∣fice in Print, such as the
<HI>Popish Counsellour Julian.</HI> Now, when People's Heads are once
actuated with such Hurricanes of Jealousies and <PB N="393" REF="415"/>
Fears, and that their Religion, Properties and Liberties are pulling down, what
can stop their Rage from attempting or believing any thing that is most
unreasonable and contradi∣ctory to the Sense of their own Good? The People
at this time were soon overperswaded to entertain Fears of the Loss of
that Liber∣ty, of which no Nation under Heaven was more secure; and yet Men
were so befooled, to undertake that which would certainly bring them to
Tyranny and Slavery. And from hence this King <HI>Charles</HI> II. felt the
Rage of that rebellious Faction in the House of Com∣mons, which endeavoured
to make his Majesty cheap abroad, and contemptible at Home, by arraigning the
Justice of his Government, and exciting a Hatred of the King's Person, and
did infest the Nation with Swarms of pestilent Libels, which like Locusts
overspread the Land, poisoned the Minds of the People, and drowned all the
little Remains of Duty, Alle∣giance, Civility, and common Honesty, offering
to remove from the King the very Guards of his royal Person, by precluding
the Advantage he might take of his own Revenues, by their unwarrantable and
unreasonable Votes, which exposed his Majesty to all Dangers that might
happen, by endeavouring to deprive him of the Possibility of supporting
the Government, by running down the King and all his loyal Sub∣jects to the
late woful, or worser Evils and Events, to which the rebellious Senate of
1641 had brought the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="416"/>Now when such a Number of discontented
People are assembled, pretending their Religion is in Danger, this does
influence them to the highest Resolution of acting, be the Attempts never
so hazardous; and we may very well re∣member, that Religion, Liberty and
Property, were lost and gone, when Monarchy by the Long Parliament was taken
away, and could never be revived, till Monarchy was most hap∣pily restored;
and if this Conspiracy had suc∣ceeded, we had been worse than ever. About
this time we heard every Day new Stories of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary
Govern∣ment, with many scurrilous Reflections upon the King; and if any Man
durst shew his Fi∣delity to the Monarchy, by opposing their
An∣timonarchical Principles, he was presently blasted with the Name of a
Court or a Church Papist. How unwarrantable were the Procee∣dings and
seditious Votes of the House of Com∣mons, and their pragmatical
intermeddling with the Succession; a Thing top sacred to be tou∣ched by
their unhallowed Hands! it being the Belief of all good, as well as learned
Men, that no Power under Heaven can hinder the Descent of the Crown upon the
next Heir of the Blood, which is his unalterable Right by Religion, Law,
History and Reason: Yet the House of Commons resolved against it, and
would not be undeceived by undeniable Arguments: Nay, they voted, they would
make his Majesty a Glorious King, with a better Revenue than any of his
Predecessors, by taking away all his <PB N="395" REF="417"/> kingly Power,
so that he should not be able to support his Friends, or suppress his
Enemies. Nay, they voted, That whosoever should lend the King any Money
upon the several Branches of his Revenue, should answer it in Parliament;
whereby they not only took away all Hopes of necessary Supplies, but tied
the Hands of the King's faithful Subjects, and would have redu∣ced him to a
more helpless Condition than the meanest of his Subjects: And they
assumed a Power to themselves of suspending Acts of Par∣liament, by
resolving, that the Prosecution of Dissenters upon the Penal Laws, was
grievous to the Subject, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom; and nothing
would serve these ill-natured Gentlemen, but a total Exclusion of his
Royal Highness's succeeding to the Crown, to which the King had often and
positively told them, he could neither in Honour, Conscience, or Justice
consent; and yet, instead of advan∣cing his Majesty's Honour and
Greatness, they persisted resolute in what they demanded. When the King
saw they went so fast, he thought it high Time to prorogue them, which he
did several times, in hopes of their agreeing at last; but they were
still so unhappy as not to agree, which rendered the Friendship of
<HI>England</HI> unsafe to trust to, and which made our warlike wary
Neighbours take other Resoluti∣ons, whereby we gratified our Enemies, and
discouraged our Friends by our unseasonable Disputes. And indeed the
Calling of Parlia∣ments does sometimes great Hurt, when more 
<PB N="396" REF="418"/> Men are called together, than can be united in
Affections and Interests, and they rather break into Factions, than join in
publick Interest; from whence have risen those dangerous Facti∣ons which
ruined the Peace and Happiness of our Nation.</P>
<P>Sovereign Princes, as ours in <HI>England,</HI> have ever been
God's Vicegerents upon Earth, deri∣ving their Power and Authority from him
alone who hath delegated Part of his own Power to Kings, and stampt his own
Character upon them; and therefore we are never to speak rudely to them, nor
design any Evil against them: And the primitive Fathers often acknow∣ledged
the Heathen Emperors to be constituted by God, and to hold their Empire from
him only, and to have God only above them: And therefore, in the early Ages of
the Church, the Doctrine of Questioning the supreme Ma∣gistrate was
unknown, and there was no such thing as Rebellion in the first Centuries of
the Church; and whatsoever the Forms of Govern∣ment were, which differ
according to the Cu∣stoms of their Country, yet the Power and Au∣thority it
self is derived from God, and never received of the People in Trust; nor is
the sovereign Power answerable to the People for the Administration of
it. But when Men pre∣sume to think, that the King is the People's Creature,
deriving his Power and Trust from them, they will implead the King's
Authority, as a conditional and precarious Thing, and upon the least
Distrust, will meditate a Revocation <PB N="397" REF="419"/> of their
Trust; so that whatsoever is done, the King must answer for it: So
apt are resty Men to clamour against their own Happiness, and to promote
the Steps of their own Ruine. <HI>Solo∣mon,</HI> who was a great and a wise
King, had some Hundreds of strange Wives, contrary to the Law of
<HI>Moses,</HI> and by reason of them, he fell to Idolatry; yet neither
Priest nor People took up Arms against him, but left it to God, who is the
proper Judge of Kings, who, in the Time appointed by his divine Providence,
raised up <HI>Jeroboam</HI> to chastise him in his Son.</P>
<P>I know, <HI>Calvin</HI> says, That the Magistrates, or any
Part of the Realm, may resist the King, being an Idolater, as <HI>Jehu</HI>
revolted from <HI>Joram,</HI> when he forsook God. Nay, he says farther,
the Government of the Kingdom is not given to the King alone; and that there is
a Stipulation in all hereditary Kingdoms: As in <HI>France,</HI> when the King
is crowned, the Bishops of <HI>Bauvais</HI> and <HI>Lyons</HI> ask the
People, if they desire and command this Man to be King. But surely
<HI>Calvin</HI> forgot that he was born at <HI>Noyon</HI> in <HI>Picardy,</HI>
and that this is no Argument that they chose him to be King, much less that
they make him such: For this is an Acceptation only, and not an Electi∣on; a
Declaration of their willing Subjection, and nothing else; the Kingdom was
confessed before to be hereditary, and the Succession was determined by
Law. The Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> count the Time of their
Reign from their Entrance to the Crown. And was not <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
several Years before he was crowned? <PB N="398" REF="420"/> The Peers are
<HI>Pares inter se,</HI> but not Compa∣nions to the King. In <HI>England</HI>
all the Power and Authority depends upon the King, and the State is nothing but
the Authority of the King, who is the Fountain whence springs all Au∣thority
and Nobility. He summons the great Council the Parliament, and dissolves
them when he pleases: And he that would restrain Sovereignty within any
narrower Bounds, or communicate it to others, makes no Difference between the
Crown of a King, and the Bonnet of a Duke of <HI>Venice.</HI> I know,
<HI>Buchanan</HI> says, Princes may be deposed by the People, if they be
Enemies to God and his Truth; and that their Subjects are freed from their
Oaths and their Obedience, and that the People are above the King, and of
greater Authority than he. The Case of the idolatrous <HI>Iraelites</HI> was
plain, the People acted nothing but by the Command of <HI>Moses,</HI> who was
supreme Magistrate, neither did he command any thing to be done, but from
the Mouth of God, according to the express Law, <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> 13.</P>
<P>This is not to put the Sword into the Peo∣ple's Hands, and to
permit them to execute their fiery Zeal upon whom they please, under
Pre∣tence of rooting out Superstition, especially such as no Man judges
so but themselves. Per∣secution in Matters of Religion is not the best
Way to advance Religion, which is the Judg∣ment of wise and learned Men, even
of Pro∣testants, and better than any can be shewed for the contrary.
<HI>Osiander</HI> says, That God doth <PB N="399" REF="421"/> not allow,
that Hereticks should be punished with Death, and forbids Magistrates to
execute any such Authority: And <HI>Calvin</HI> was of the same Opinion,
till he was settled in Power at <HI>Geneva.</HI> For before, he was much for
Liber∣ty of Conscience; and of the same Judgment was <HI>Melancton</HI> and
many other learned Prote∣stants, as, <HI>Cassander, Grotius,</HI> and
many other of the middle Temper. The Cantons of <HI>Switzer∣land</HI> agree
well in temperate things; and does not the famous Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI>
tolerate Di∣versity of Religions? and the great Emperor of <HI>Muscovy</HI>
does the same. What Reason can be given by indifferent Men, why the Policy
of <HI>England</HI> should be so singular, and so differing from that
of all other Christian Kingdoms and Nations about her? Why should the
<HI>English</HI> Government be more severe in this Point, than that of our
Neighbours? It may seem some∣thing to reflect upon the Honour of our
Na∣tion, to mention the <HI>Turk</HI> in this Case; yet certainly it cannot
be denied, but that Christi∣ans live quietly in the <HI>Turk</HI>'s
Dominions, and upon Conditions so easy, that the Catholicks in
<HI>England</HI> would be well contented with the like, who by the Grace of God
have, and would de∣mean themselves as loyally in all Points, as not to
attempt any thing offensive to the State, or prejudicial to the publick
Peace. There is nothing in the Catholick Religion inconsistent with
Loyalty; and Catholicks are in Truth better Subjects than Protestants have
shewed themselves to be, generally speaking, conside∣ring 
<PB N="400" REF="422"/> their Principles. Can any Man deny, but that there was a
most horrid Rebellion carried on by Protestants in <HI>England?</HI> And
the Catholicks hope, that having always wished well to his Majesty's Title,
and prayed for his happy Succession to his Kingdoms, that their so long
tried Fidelity will at last procure them some Liberty and Refreshment. I
know, <HI>Calvin</HI> says, they are out of their Wits who desire to live
under Sovereign Monarchies; and says, Order and Policy must needs decay,
where one Man holds such an Extent of Government: And Kings, says he,
oftentimes forget they are Men, and they are styled <HI>Dei
gratiâ,</HI> for no other Purpose, but to shew that they acknow∣ledge
no Superior upon Earth, and that they usually make Choice of such
Counsellours as can best fit their Humours, and accommodate themselves to
their Appetites: So that he ma∣keth Kings nothing the better for having
Coun∣sellours, whom he stains with an intolerable Scandal. And
<HI>Buchanan</HI> says, St. <HI>Paul</HI> com∣mands Obedience to Princes, in
the Infancy of the Church; and if he had lived at this Time, he would have
said otherwise. But as it is said, <HI>Nullum unquam magnum ingenium
sine aliqua mixtura insaniae</HI>; so <HI>Buchanan</HI> was a
high-soaring Wit, and had some Tincture of Phrenzy: For had he been
perfectly sound, he would never have let slip such a <HI>Hysteron
Pro∣teron</HI> as this from his Pen. And <HI>Knox,</HI> in his History of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> not only justifies what <HI>Buchanan</HI> says, but
would be content, that <PB N="401" REF="423"/> there were publick Rewards
appointed for such as murder Tyrants, as there are for such as kill Wolves;
which is a most pernicious Doctrine, fit for nothing but to encourage a
<HI>Ravilliac,</HI> or a <HI>Poltrat. Calvin,</HI> who writes in the Quality of
a Divine, in his Institutions, makes a <HI>Nebuchadnezar</HI> of all Kings,
that he might not come short of his Predecessor <HI>Martin
Luther.</HI></P>
<P>I confess, Princes once dispossessed seldom
recover their Hold again. There is none will deny, but that it is necessary
the Government of all Princes should be regulated by Laws, and that Persons
in Authority do observe those Rules that are prescribed to them by
those to whom that Power belongs. I pretend not to enhance the Authority of
Princes so far, as to exempt them from the Rule of Law, or to make them
arbitrary in their Government: But when it is said, <HI>Vos estis Dii,</HI>
they are justly established in the supreme Authority; and when <HI>I
have said, Ye are Gods,</HI> surely it was inten∣ded rather to teach the
World a Lesson of Obe∣dience, than Rebellion; and Kings by those Words
are justly established by divine Provi∣dence in the same Authority, and
exempted from any popular Cognizance. It's proper on∣ly for God to say,
<HI>Transferam Regna de Gente in Gentem:</HI> The Translating of Kingdoms is
the extraordinary Dispensation of divine Pro∣vidence, for Reasons known
to God's secret Wisdom: And tho' this be done by the Hands of Men, yet are
not the common People licen∣sed thereby to run upon any irregular Designs 
<PB N="402" REF="424"/> of their own Head, and to take Revenge of their
Governours. St. <HI>Paul</HI> commands every Soul to pay Obedience and Honour
to <HI>Nero,</HI> who was God's Lieutenant upon Earth, and had the Image of God
upon him, that is, God's Authority, and was therefore to be used with due
Honour and Reverence. When <HI>Julian,</HI> of a Christian Emperor, became
Apostate, and persecuted the Christians with great Cruelty; tho' the
People sharply reproved, and inveighed against his Proceedings, yet none of
them took up Arms against him, to depose him of Domi∣nion or Life; and if
they thought it not expe∣dient to do so against a Tyrant, who only acted by
his exorbitant Passions, how much less would they have thought it lawful
to be done against such Princes as govern legally, and do nothing against
Religion. We must know, that Kings are to be considered in a double
Ca∣pacity, of Nature, and of Policy: The Body Politick never dies, and so is
never defective of Authority. The Acts of the Body Politick are not abated by
the Natural Body's Access; the Body Politick is not disabled to govern by
the Nonnage of the Natural. So in the 4th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the
Leases of the Dutchy of <HI>Lancaster</HI> made by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.
were resolved by all the Judges to be good, tho' made in the King's Minority:
For tho' the King's Body Natural cannot judge, yet that disables not, that
the Acts of his Minority, ordered by his Council or Regent, should be of no
Vali∣dity. The Parliament certainly would not take <PB N="403" REF="425"/> it
well, if a Catholick should affirm, that the Change of Religion made by King
<HI>Edward</HI> VI. was not warrantable, being done in his Mino∣rity, when he
had not Age to discern what he did, being in the Hands of the Protector and
<HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P>But, suppose the King breaks his Coronation Oath, may not
many things happen after his Oath taken, to excuse him from Perjury? By Law,
every Oath, how absolute soever, hath always this necessary Condition
annexed tacit∣ly, <HI>viz. Rebus sic stantibus,</HI> that things remain as
they were, when the Oath was taken: But if such Alterations, which make
either the Oath or Promise impossible, or unlawful to be per∣formed, a
Man doth not then commit Perjury, that breaks his Oath or Promise. What, if
that which the King at his Inauguration pro∣mised for the Good of his People,
cannot be observed, without great Damage to them? If the Condition of Affairs
be so changed, Reso∣lutions upon them must also change. Dr.
<HI>Bil∣son,</HI> a great Divine, and a great Prelate of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> and chosen on Purpose by the great Statesmen of his
Time, to write <HI>Cum Privilegio,</HI> puts the Question, Whether a King
shall be deposed for breaking his Coro∣nation Oath? And he answers in the
Negative, and gives this Reason: <HI>The People may not break with their
Prince so often as he breaks with God: For,</HI> says he, <HI>Subjects
cannot depose their Prin∣ces, to whom they must be subject for
Conscience sake</HI>; which Doctrine is quite contrary to what 
<PB N="404" REF="426"/> is now taught. And farther, Dr. <HI>Bilson</HI>
says, That <HI>Subjects are forbidden to take Arms against their
Princes;</HI> the Reason hereof he says is invincible: <HI>For to him that
may Kill and War against a Prince, Killing him is of Consequence
inevitable. The Apostle,</HI> saith he, <HI>obeyed Ty∣rants that commanded
all things against Reli∣gion; and in those things they did submit
them∣selves with Meekness to endure the Magi∣strate's Pleasure, and not
to obey his Will.</HI> And he concludes, <HI>That if the Laws of the Land
appoint the Nobles, as next the King, to assist him in doing right, and
to withold him from do∣ing wrong, then they are licensed by Man's Law to
interpose themselves, but in no Case to deprive the Prince where the
Scepter is inherited.</HI></P>
<P>It is most manifest, that this Spirit of Refor∣mation hath
ever been, and is most dangerous to those Princes and States where it gets
Foot∣ing. This was it which begat so many Conspi∣racies against Queen
<HI>Mary</HI>: So that more Prin∣ces have been deposed and persecuted by
Pro∣testants their Subjects, upon the Difference of Religion, than have been
by the Practices of any Catholick Subjects in any time before Queen
<HI>Mary</HI>'s Days, for Six Hundred Years. But we will send them to Doctor
<HI>Bilson,</HI> a great Divine of their own Church, who holds it an Article
of Faith, that Princes were not to be deposed; which was good Doctrine in the
Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> tho' it was not thought so in the Reign of
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who reigned not much above Five Years, and yet had more
Insur∣rections <PB N="405" REF="427"/> raised against her in that small
Time, than Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had from the Catholicks in Forty Five
Years; and yet Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was very merciful, and shewed much
Compassion to such as deserved not well of her: To the Dutchess of
<HI>Somerset</HI>; to Sir <HI>John Clarke,</HI> who had been a principal
Corrupter of King <HI>Edward</HI> her Brother's Infancy; to the Lord Chief
Ju∣stice <HI>Montague,</HI> who both counselled and sub∣scribed to her
Disinheriting; and to many others who were attainted, that neither affected
her Religion nor Title, and were then Priso∣ners in the <HI>Tower</HI>; and
yet she released them all: And for all this, the Zealots of her Time would
not suffer her to enjoy any Quiet, but murmured against the Government of
Women, and did conspire and plot her Deprivation, out of a Desire to
advance her Successor, under whom they expected a golden Age. And
<HI>Knox</HI> then said, the Nobility, Magistrates, and Judges, and the
whole People of <HI>England,</HI> were bound in Conscience not only to
oppose the Proceedings of that <HI>Jezabel, Mary,</HI> but even to have
killed her, and all her Priests with her.</P>
<P>After the Death of this Queen, her Sister <HI>Elizabeth</HI>
came to the Crown, and the whole Christian World stood amazed at such a
sudden Alteration; and the rather, because Religion had been so lately
and so solemnly restored by Parliament. Also, the Queen that now was
had always professed her self a Catholick, du∣ring the Reign of her
Sister, and did constantly <PB N="406" REF="428"/> hear Mass, and went
often to Confession; and in open Parliament, after her Intention for a
Change in Religion, began to be discovered, she used Policy, at least;
for she assured the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, that no Trouble should
arise to them for any Difference in Religion, which did much abate the
Opposition that otherwise might probably have been made by the Catho∣lick
Party, and put the Clergy themselves in Hopes of some fair Quarter under
her Govern∣ment. She knew well, that a Prince alone, how sovereign soever,
could not establish a new Religion in this Kingdom, without a Parlia∣ment
to give Authority and Countenance to it; and therefore, to win the Bishops,
and the rest of the Catholicks in Parliament, to Silence, at least, she
was content to use Policy with them, and promise them fair; and she
also thought good to qualify the Style somewhat, from <HI>Su∣preme
Head</HI> changing it into <HI>Supreme Gover∣nour</HI>; which altered not the
Sense, yet it abu∣sed some into a Belief, that the Queen preten∣ded not
much in Matters Ecclesiastical, as the King her Father had done, who was
<HI>Flagelium Dei,</HI> the Scourge of God to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and the first King in our Nation that ever tried the admirable Patience,
Obedience, and Loyalty of his Catholick Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>Nicephorus Phocas,</HI> the Emperor, was the nearest
Parallel to this King that we meet with in all the Ecclesiastical
History; for he resu∣med all Donations that had been made unto
Monasteries and Churches in his Time; but <PB N="407" REF="429"/> such
Afflictions followed him ever after, that <HI>Basilius</HI> his Successor
(who was none of the best Emperors) was yet careful to abrogate those Laws
of <HI>Phocas</HI> among his first Acts, as the Root of all the Calamities of
those Times. Nor did any better Success attend King <HI>Harrie</HI>'s
Impieties. His exorbitant Lusts, which were the Original of all the
Mischiefs which the Nation suffered, became at last his Torments. No King
was ever more necessitated in Point of Treasure, in very few Years after
that immense Treasure left him by his royal Father. Never did King lay more
heavy Taxes upon his Sub∣jects, and never any King did use more ignoble and
unprincely Ways to raise Money; and to shew God's great Displeasure
against him, he was frustrated of that which was pretended to be his
chiefest Design, <HI>viz.</HI> Succession and Issue: All his noble
Stems and Branches were taken away, one after the other, without Issue, and
his Crown translated to another Name and Na∣tion, God suffering him as a
blind Man, to err and wander in all his Courses; and all the great Treasure
which he had raked together upon the Ruine of the Church, was all spent in
Excess and Vanity, and not to any Honour of the Kingdom, nor Ease of his
Subjects, or Maintenance of the Borders, or Relief of the Poor (all which were
at first mainly pretended) but at last all was employed in Tiltings,
Masks, and Mummeries, and in pleasing and inviting his Mistresses,
and to satisfy the greedy Appe∣tites of those Sollicitors of his Lust.
And when <PB N="408" REF="430"/> the King had thus wearied his Subjects with a
long and inglorious Reign, and that he found his Soul as much oppressed
with the Guilt of his Sins, as his Body was become unweildy thro' his
excessive Intemperance; he died (as some say) desirous to repent, and
be reconciled to the Church; but what Effect his Desires had, is only known
to God: And yet the Catho∣licks took all patiently, raised no Tumults or
Insurrections, but were Examples of the true <HI>Israelites,</HI> and did
imitate, in some Measure, their divine Master's Meekness, and
resolved rather to undergo God's just Punishment in the King's great
Injustice, than to shew themselves like so many <HI>Lutherans</HI> or
<HI>Calvinists,</HI> and had only the true Christian Arms, of Prayers and
Tears, by Submission to God's Will.</P>
<P>Kings indeed ought to consider, that God hath placed them over
his People, as Examples, to give Countenance to their Laws, by their own
strict Observation of them; and that as their Subjects are to be protected
by their Prin∣ces, so they are to be assisted and supported by each
other, the Function of Kings being an Order by it self; and the Rebellion of
Sub∣jects ought to be looked upon by all other Kings as an Assault upon
their own Sovereignty, and in some Degree a Design against Monarchy it
self, and consequently to be suppressed in what Kingdom soever it
is, with the like Concern∣ment as if it were in their own Bowels: And all
foreign Ministers, who ought to have been highly concerned for the Murder of
K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. <PB N="409" REF="431"/> by his merciless Rebels, and to
have vindica∣ted that royal Blood, did scarce murmur at it, but made haste
to send over their Emissaries to get a Share in the Spoils of a murdered
Prince: And yet not one of those Monarchs and Prin∣ces, which bought all the
costly Pictures, and rich Hangings and Furniture, ever restored any of
their unlawful Purchases to the King after his most happy Restoration.
'Tis true, the then King of <HI>Spain</HI> expressed a very tender Sense
of our King's Sufferings, and said, it concerned all Kings to join together,
for Pu∣nishment of such an impious Rebellion, and cruel Parricide, whilst
his own Abmbassador, <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> then in
<HI>England,</HI> not only countenanced and joined with the Parlia∣ment, but
bought the greatest and best Part of all the rare Pictures and rich
Moveables, which he sold in <HI>Spain</HI> at great Rates: And whilst he
was in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he gave Count <HI>Fuensaldagna</HI> a false
Relation of the <HI>English</HI> Affairs, assuring him that the
<HI>English</HI> Monarchy would never again be restored; and when it
happened, he was laughed at by all. However, it is certain, that whilst that
great Impostor <HI>Cromwell</HI> lived, his Power at Home was nothing
considerable to what it was Abroad: For <HI>France, Spain, Hol∣land,</HI> and
all the neighbouring Princes feared him to that Degree, that there was nothing
he could have demanded of them that they would have denied him.</P>
<P>No Man can deny, but that many well-mean∣ing Men were seduced
by the disguised Designs <PB N="410" REF="432"/> of that mysterious Age,
and by those Villains who always had in their Aim to destroy Mo∣narchy, and
unhinge the whole Frame of Go∣vernment; and the sober Party were cozened by
the Artifices of that loathsome Hypocrite, <HI>Cromwell:</HI> Till at last
they were inspired with a Resolution to redeem themselves, their
Reli∣gion and Liberties, which were treacherously taken from them by Deceit
and Fraud; and to free themselves from the miserable Yoke they lay under,
when they plainly saw, that Reli∣gion, Reformation, and Liberty, were only
deceitful Baits to draw in the deluded Multi∣tude: But still their most
hopeful Designs not being carried on with that Prudence and Pre∣caution which
was necessary, they were always discovered, and did rather settle and
confirm, than weaken the Rebellion; till that over-ru∣ling Hand of Providence,
which guides and determines the Affairs of the whole World, was most
visibly seen in his Majesty's most happy Restoration.</P>
<P>It is no new thing for the worst of Men to make use of the
sacred Name of Religion, to palliate their abominable Undertakings. The Ruine
of pious Kings and Princes, the Over∣turning all Order in the World, the
tragical Transactions of the last Age, the Convulsions of State, the
Commotions of the People, the many Changes and Overturnings of Governours and
Governments, were the sad Effects of the pretended Reformation; and all
these Mischiefs were usher'd in with the Lamb-like, harmless 
<PB N="411" REF="433"/> Voice of Religion. They came indeed in Sheeps Cloathing,
who inwardly were ravening Wolves. Some Mens Religion inclines them to Faction,
and there is none to dangerous Faction as that which is nourished by the
Corruption of false Religion. The <HI>Jewish</HI> Zealots and the
<HI>English</HI> Enthusiasts are a plain Example of it; and therefore
when Men make great Pretences, and begin to talk factiously, a fair
Opportunity is very like to make them Rebels: And those who have seen what
the Event of those Actions were in the Years of 1640 and 1641, when they
saw the same things acted over again, and even by some of the same Men,
they might easily and certainly expect the same Events: And if Men had
seriously observed this, the same Men would never have played over the
same Game twice in the same Age; which obliged the then Lord Chancellor to
take Notice of it in his Speech to both Houses of Parliament, That he hoped
they would not see three Kingdoms quite de∣stroyed twice in one Age, by the
same Methods; telling them, when Men were in their Wits, they would not fall
into the same Pit, in which they had seen others fall before them, when
even Beasts will not do it, let the Bait be what it will. But, alas! many of
those who were the principal Makers of the first, were so far from
falling into it, that they were the chiefest Diggers of the second Pit, in
which so many had fallen: And we were then come to that Pass, that it was
an unpardonable Crime for any Man to look as if he thought the Cry of
<HI>Popery!</HI> was false, <PB N="412" REF="434"/> and made a Property only
(as it then really was) to serve some Mens Ends and Designs.</P>
<P>It was a great Fault in King <HI>Charles</HI> I. at least, a
great Weakness in him, to divest him∣self of the Power of dissolving
the Long Par∣liament, which was a just Prerogative belong∣ing to him: And
tho' the Parliament then said, that should not encourage them to do any
thing which otherwise was not fit for them to do; yet they soon invaded the
publick Liberty, and they who said they had no Mind to be Slaves, were yet
willing to be Tyrants themselves, and would admit no Rules to govern by but
their own Will; not considering the Misery of <HI>Athens</HI> was at the
highest when it was governed by Thirty Tyrants. And therefore the wisest
Course of Princes is frequently to summon Parliaments, and seasonably
to dissolve them after their applying Cures to those Diseases they
had discovered, whereby they would be of great Esteem to the Crown, as well
as Veneration with the People, and not let them sit any longer, lest they
should fall into Factions, and pretend to find Grievances where there are
none. And if King <HI>Charles</HI> II. had lived some Years longer, he had
certainly brought them to that Pass, and preserved <HI>England</HI> from
the Distractions that have since followed; which his Majesty foresaw,
and which caused him to make those frequent Intervals of Parliaments. And
yet his Majesty declared unto them, That none of his Predecessors ever
had a greater Esteem for Parliaments, the King believing 
<PB N="413" REF="435"/> them to be the vital Part of the Constitution of the
Kingdom, and so necessary for the Govern∣ment of it, that neither Prince
nor People could be happy without them; and looked up∣on their Counsels as
the best he could receive, and was as tender of their Privileges, and as
careful to preserve and protect them, as of his own royal Authority; knowing
that all good Subjects would be jealous of any thing that might infringe or
impair his royal Authori∣ty, his own Interest being entirely bound up with
that of his Subjects. But they should consider, that Parliament Men sit
as Subjects, not as Superiors, and that they are called to be the King's
Counsellours, not Dictators, their Summons being only to recommend their
Advice, not to command. They should be wise, dispassionate, good
Patriots, to raise up those Banks and Fences which were cast down by
Rebellion, in Hopes that the same Prosperi∣ty should spring up again
from those Roots which it did heretofore, and hath always grown, tho' it was
very hard to redeem our Nation from the Infamy it had undergone, and to
restore it to all it had lost, and to make the King and People as happy as
they ought to be; and there was nothing that the Parliament could propose for
the Happiness of the King∣dom, in which the King did not contend with them to
compass, the King not being only wil∣ling, but desirous to gratify his
People, by se∣curing their Religion, Liberties and Properties, by as many
good Laws as the Parliament <PB N="414" REF="436"/> would propose. He was
absolutely determined to do all that in him lay to glad the Hearts of his
People, and gave them many Opportunities of providing for their Good; and it
could not be imputed to his Majesty, that the Success did not answer his
Expectation.</P>
<P>The particular Causes of the King's Dissa∣tisfaction were
such, that what he recommen∣ded to the House of Commons to avoid, they
purposely fell into; and tho' the King solemn∣ly promised to comply with
any thing that would have been proposed for Security of the Protestant
Religion as by Law established, that might consist with preserving
the Succession of the Crown in its due and legal Course of De∣scent:
Yet to all his Majesty's Offers he met with most unsuitable and most
unwarrantable Returns. The King would most willingly have consented to any
Expedient by which the Pro∣testant Religion established might have been
preserved, and the Monarchy not destroyed: But no Expedient would serve
those ill-natured Gentlemen of the House of Commons, but the total
Exclusion of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which his Majesty had so often
declared, was a Point which in Honour, Justice and Conscience, he could not
consent to. When this Bill of Ex∣clusion was first set on Foot, it was
well said, by a noble Person then in the House of Com∣mons, That the King
might outlive the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and then all they were doing would be
unnecessary; and why should they, to pre∣vent that which might not be,
attempt to do <PB N="415" REF="437"/> that which they could never justify,
either to the King or Country. When the King found they went contrary to the
direct Rules of Law, that he was deceived by them, and that the Follies and
Imprudencies of the prevailing Par∣ty in the House of Commons (some of
which had given Birth and Growth to the Miseries of the last Age) and were
now pouring in Vinegar instead of Oil, into the Wounds of the Nation, and
departed from that Fidelity which they owed the King, and that Zeal which they
should have shewed to his Service, and that nothing would serve them of
the same Leaven with those of 1641, but the total Exclusion of his Royal
Highness succeeding to the Crown, and had prepared an Act for it, the King
came in Per∣son to the House of Lords, and sent for the Commons to attend
him, in the Year 1680. The King then spake roundly to them, and told them how
unsatisfied he was with their extra∣vagant Proceedings, and desired to know
spee∣dily, how he should be assisted by them, and what they desired
from him, assuring them in the Word of a King, that he would concur to any
thing for the Security of the Protestant Religion, as it was established
by Law, but still upon the same Terms he had formerly proposed to them,
and that he would never do it other∣wise.</P>
<P>But before the House of Commons went to the Lords, where the
King in his Robes ex∣pected them, they passed those ensuing Votes: That
the only Way for suppressing of Popery, <PB N="416" REF="438"/> was, that
a Bill should be brought in to banish immediately all the considerable
Papists in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> out of the King's Dominions: That so long as
the Papists had any Hopes of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s succeeding to the
Crown, the King's Person, the Protestant Religion, the Lives, Liberties and
Properties of all his Ma∣jesty's Protestant Subjects, were in apparent
Danger to be destroyed. They farther voted, That a Bill should be brought
in for an Asso∣ciation of all his Majesty's Protestant Subjects, for
the Safety of his Majesty's Person, for De∣fence of the Protestant
Religion against all Ty∣ranny and Oppression whatsoever; and for
pre∣venting the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> or any Papist, for succeeding to the
Crown. They did likewise declare, That it was the Opinion, that the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> had been removed from his Offices and Commands, by the
Influence of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>; and that an Address should be made
to the King, to restore the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI> to his Offices and
Commands; and resol∣ved likewise (just before the King being in his Robes
had sent for them to the Lords House to prorogue them) that whosoever
advised the King to that Prorogation, which they said was done on Purpose
against Passing the Bill for Exclusion of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
was a Betrayer of the King, the Protestant Religion, the King∣dom of
<HI>England,</HI> a Promoter of the <HI>French</HI> Interest, and a
Pensioner of <HI>France.</HI> They also voted at the same time, That it
was the Opinion of the House, that the City of <HI>London</HI> 
<PB N="417" REF="439"/> was burnt by the Papists in 1666, thereby de∣signing
to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Power. Upon these extravagant, insolent,
and disloyal Votes, the King forthwith dissolved the Parliament.</P>
<P>Now the strangest thing was, that those who most
pretended in the House of Commons for Reformation, had a bare-fac'd Contempt
and Distaste of all Religion whatsoever, and not so much as the Shadow
of Vertue: Men of the most licentious Lives, of the most seared
Con∣sciences, of the most profligate Reputation, that had bid Defiance to
all Religion, and most di∣ligently cultivated Atheism and Profaneness. It
is indeed enough to move the most patient Man upon Earth, to consider what
Foreheads of Steel and Adamant those impious Wretches had, who were thus
confident to gull and im∣pose upon the People of <HI>England,</HI> by
seem∣ing Zeal for Religion and Reformation: But such as rebel under
Pretence of Religion, are most dangerous to the Government; they will pretend
to defend the King's Person against Ca∣tholicks, that themselves only
might have the Honour of subverting the Government; so hard a thing it is
to cure one that is bewitched with the Principles of Rebellion, that after many
Years he shall return to his Trade as boldly as if his former Pranks had
never been heard of. Fear of Popery, Arbitrary Government, and evil
Counsellours, in my Memory, since the Year 1641, made our
<HI>English</HI> Nation run mad, cost an infinite Treasure, with the
Lives of <PB N="418" REF="440"/> some Thousand <HI>English</HI>; and, in
Conclusion, instead of Religion, setting up Enthusiasm; instead of
Liberty, the Nation was enslaved to a military Power; instead of Property,
Plunder, Sacrilege, and Sequestration; and they were just playing the
same Game over again in this King's Time, if by little less than a Miracle,
they had not been prevented: And whosoever throws off his Allegiance to his
Sovereign, he renounces all Duty and Conscience towards God.</P>
<P>The King calls a Parliament by his own Writ and Authority
(without which they cannot meet) to give him faithful Counsel about his
most weighty Affairs; but he does not resign up his Interest and Freedom:
He never sub∣jects himself to their absolute Determination: He always
weighs their Counsels, as coming from a Body entrusted by him; and when he
dissents from them, he tells them the Reasons which prevailed with his
Conscience and Un∣derstanding, with that Candor that a Prince should do
towards his Subjects. A King should look upon his Parliament as his great
Council, to whose Advice he should always have Regard: But a King should
likewise look upon himself, as neither deprived of his Understanding, nor
divested of any Right he had, if there was no Parliament sitting. The
King's Power is un∣doubtedly very useful for his People's Liber∣ty, and
Parliaments ought not to set Bounds to their Princes; and wise Princes will
never de∣sire nor affect more Greatness or Prerogative, 
<PB N="419" REF="441"/> than what is really for the Good of their Subjects.</P>
<P>The Truth is, since the happy Restoration of our King, his
People were given up to too much Joy and Forgetfulness of our past
Mise∣ries; and there was not such a Return to God for his wonderful
Blessings, as was due to the great Giver of them; and when we saw some
Portion of that innocent royal Blood which was spilt, recompensed upon
some of their Heads, who were the wicked Contrivers of that Parricide: When
the Miseries of our Na∣tion, and the Sufferings of the Royal Family were all
recovered by the unerring Hand of divine Providence, without the Intervention
of any foreign Prince, many of the same Men joining in the Settlement of our
distracted Na∣tion, who had before been active in the De∣struction of their
Country, to shew how sensi∣ble they were of their former Errors and great
Miscarriages; it then manifestly appearing to them, and all others (who
were not wilfully blind) that the Bill of Exclusion was carried on with that
Violence, to facilitate the Dethro∣ning of the King and his Successor, who
had ventured his Blood as frankly both by Sea and Land, in the Good of the
Country, as the meanest Subject in it; and had manifested his unalterable
Loyalty and Affection to his Ma∣jesty and his Subjects, by reducing
<HI>Scotland</HI> to Obedience, whose Conduct in that Affair was both wise
and prosperous.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="442"/>Now, when the Nation had scarce wiped
their Eyes dry for the Blood of the incompa∣rable Father, they were ready to be
drowned again in Tears for the Murder of the succeed∣ing Son, if their
Cruelty had been effected. The Rage of those Rebels in the Long Parlia∣ment
had only the Blood of one King for its Gratification; but here the Rebels
intended to have glutted their Thirst of Blood, by mur∣thering Two at one
Blow, the King with his Royal Brother: And to give their Inhumanity the
highest Ascent, they were preparing to murder a Prince whose august
Majesty had not only enobled the Nation, and once more resto∣red it from
its lost Reputation abroad, but made his own Kingdom (as he then had Reason
to think) an Ark of Safety at home, when almost all other Christian Nations
were deluged in Blood and Confusion.</P>
<P>Who would have imagined a Design should be laid to murder
that King, the Blood of whose Royal Father still cried for Vengeance? Who
would imagine, that he who was restored almost by a Miracle, when the
People of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> ran chearfully into Obedience, and met his
Majesty with Duty and Love, and received him with triumphant Hosanna's,
with many Protestations of Sorrow for their former Mis∣carriages, and with
many Vows of Loyalty and Obedience? Who would have thought, after so many
Promises of making him a Glorious King! After such Acts of Indemnity
granted to such Monsters of Rebels! After such Profusions 
<PB N="421" REF="443"/> of royal Bounty to such undeserving Villains! After
so many Professions of the Care they would have for the Preservation of
his sacred Life! After so many specious Addresses of his most
Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, as they cal∣led themselves? Who, I say, would
imagine, that after all this, any Man could be found to conspire to murder
his sacred Majesty? As if all his Condescensions and Favours had been
Injuries to make Reprisals upon his Life; and then resolved to revenge his
Death upon others, when they were doing it themselves. In the Bill of
Exclusion, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was to be set aside for the King's
Preservation; but in this Plot the King was to be murdered for the Duke's
sake; and both King and Duke being taken in the same Dilemma (after the
Presbyterian Lo∣gick) were to be sacrificed: And had their Conspiracy
taken Effect, they would so far have extenuated the Matter, that Cutting of
Throats would only be called a <HI>Scotch</HI> Way of Trimming, and the
Destruction of the King and Duke, to be no more but a perfecting the Work of
entire Reformation: And if this Con∣spiracy had succeeded, it would have
put an End to our national Constitution, and a Period to the very
Fundamentals of all human Society.</P>
<P>I know no Deliverances come nearer to those of King
<HI>David,</HI> than those wonderful Delive∣rances of this King: First from
his Escape at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and from so many <HI>Sheba's</HI> and
<HI>Achi∣tophels,</HI> which God from time to time wrought for him; which
perhaps no Age, no State, no <PB N="422" REF="444"/> History can shew the
like: But this Conspiracy was the more terrible, in that <HI>Achitophel</HI>
was in the Head of it, who had corrupted and debauched the counterfeit
<HI>Absalom. Achitophel!</HI> that false and treacherous Villain; that
dextrous Man at Wickedness; that cunning crafty Politician, who had been
President of the King's Council, who was esteemed as an Oracle! That
hardened Trai∣tor, who stole away, that he might die in his Bed, when it was
Pity that such an inveterate and advising Rebel should have died any
other Way, than by the Hand of Justice, which he had certainly done without
an <HI>Ignoramus Jury,</HI> when the highest Treason was formed by such
working Heads, and conducted by such poli∣tick Counsels; for it was not
only countenan∣ced and abetted by the <HI>Faeces</HI> of the People, but was
really incouraged by some of the No∣bility, who had affronted his Majesty,
by Pe∣titioning, Protesting, and Caballing, which gave the seditious
Faction a full Assurance, that they were powerful enough to overturn the
Mo∣narcy, their Design being to be executed by such desperate Villains,
that nothing less could be ex∣pected, than the Kingdom's inevitable Ruine,
had not the King been miraculously preserved.</P>
<P>But how shameful a thing was it, that Per∣sons of Birth and
Quality should condescend to be Tools, and to creep in the Dust, to
humour a base, unworthy, disloyal Faction, taken out of the Dregs of the
People? That they should endeavour to extinguish that Light from whence
they derived their own Lustre, and to shine <PB N="423" REF="445"/> only by
the Favour of an inconstant heady Mul∣titude, and the King's Death (however
it hap∣pened) was to be put upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Catho∣licks; and those
Rebels had a Person ready to take upon him the Government, whose
Pre∣sumption in the next Reign, owning his false Title to the Crown,
brought him to end his Life upon a Scaffold, instead of a Throne, which he
aimed at; and if he had gained his Point, he had entailed War and Blood to our
unborn Posterity; against which no Caution could certainly be too great,
nor against that Distemper from which we were so miraculously
recovered, when there was no Cause to fear the Loss of Religion, Liberty,
and Property; neither did they believe themselves, who pre∣tended to be
afraid of them. The Moderation of a Prince was never more shewed than by this
King, who then suffered so much licenti∣ous Talk to pass unpunished;
and there ap∣peared fewer Grievances in his Time than had ever been before, and
<HI>England</HI> seemed never more happy than at this Time: And it was a
strange Ingratitude of those who seemed ill at Ease un∣der so
temperate a Government, who were yet so numerous in the House of Commons,
that they out-voted the best Men in it; which made the King often prorogue
them, which proved fatal to his Successor, tho' this King did all that was
possible, to keep his People in Peace whilst he lived, and to leave them
so when he died; which puts me in Mind of a prophetical Saying of this King
to me, some Years before his Death.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="446"/>About two Years before the Death of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. he gave me Leave to come into <HI>England,</HI> and sent
the <HI>Katherine</HI> Yacht to <HI>Ostend</HI> for me. Some Days after my
Arrival at <HI>White∣hall,</HI> he commanded me to walk with him to <HI>Hyde
Park;</HI> and as I walked with him (the rest of the Company keeping at a
good Distance) he told me, that I had served him very well at
<HI>Brussels,</HI> and that his Brother had given him a very good Account
of my Carriage towards him there. His Majesty then told me, that I had
served him as Agent and Resident for many Years; and tho' he constantly
used to change his Ministers, at least their Station, every three Years;
that yet I had served him so much to his Satisfaction, that he was
resolved never to remove me from <HI>Brussels</HI> whilst he lived,
espe∣cially during the Wars in <HI>Flanders,</HI> because I had always
given him a very particular Account of them, and that I knew that Country very
well, and the Interest of all the great Men in it; and that I was there very
well approved of, and that my Diligence and Activity in his Ser∣vice had been
very considerable in those trou∣blesome Times: And, after having asked
me many Questions about the Nobility of those Countries, he said, that
during his Exile abroad, he had seen many Countries, of which none pleased
him so much as that of the <HI>Fle∣mings,</HI> which were the most honest
and true∣hearted Race of People that he had met with; and then added, <HI>but I
am weary of travelling, I am resolved to go abroad no more: But when</HI> 
<PB N="425" REF="447"/> <HI>I am dead and gone, I know not what my Bro∣ther will
do: I am much afraid, that when he comes to the Crown, he will be obliged to
travel again: And yet I will take Care to leave my Kingdoms to him in Peace,
wishing he may long keep them so. But this hath all of my Fears, little of
my Hopes, and less of my Reason; and I am much afraid, that when my Brother
comes to the Crown, he will be obliged again to leave his native Soil.</HI>
This Discourse of the King's I have often remembered with much Grief and
Sorrow, which hath been — true in all its Circumstances: And certainly
had this King loved Business as well as he understood it, he had been the
greatest Prince of his Time.</P>
<P>Some time after my Return to <HI>Brussels,</HI> in the Year
1684, I received this following Let∣ter from the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI>
who was then Principal Secretary of State, in whose Province I was, dated
<HI>April</HI> 14, 1684.</P>

<P><PB N="426" REF="448"/>About this time, several
<HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Officers came daily to see me from the
Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Camp then at <HI>Dighnin</HI> near
<HI>Brus∣sels</HI>; and some of them being very inquisitive to know
what News I had from <HI>England,</HI> the Time being then very critical, I
shewed them my Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s Letter to me, which, it seems,
had such Influence upon some of them, that the next Day, when the Duke of
<HI>Mon∣mouth</HI> went from <HI>Brussels</HI> to the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI>'s Camp, which he did very frequently, and the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> had given a general Order, that whenever the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> entered the Camp, the whole Army should stand to their
Arms. But that Day, when the Duke entered the Camp, some <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Scotch</HI> Of∣ficers did neither stand to their Arms, as the Duke
passed by them, nor their Companies; of which Neglect the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> took particular Notice, and complained to his High∣ness of
their Neglect. Whereupon the Prince forthwith sent for those Officers, and
sharply reprehended them for not obeying his Orders; who thereupon told the
Prince, that the <HI>English</HI> Resident had given them Orders not to do
it. Whereat the Prince was very angry; which being told me by some of the
Officers, I went the next Day, with Intention to dine with the Prince, and had
my Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s Letter in my Pocket. But when I came to the
Prince's Quarters, being informed that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was there,
I thought not fit to stay, <PB N="427" REF="449"/> but dined with one of the
<HI>English</HI> Collonels in the Camp; and after Dinner I waited on the
Prince, and was conducted into his Closet, where the Prince came presently,
and after usual Salutation, his Highness asked me, how I came to give
Orders to the Officers of his Army not to stand to their Arms when the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> entered his Camp? I told the Prince, that I never gave
them any Orders: That I had, at their earnest Request, shewed them a
Letter I had newly received from my Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI>; and that if his
Highness pleased, I would shew it him. Whereupon he desired to see
it; and after reading it privately to himself, he presently told me, if I
had done no more than shewed them the Letter, I had done no more than my
Duty, and that it was the Fault of his Officers in not obeying his Commands:
That for the King of <HI>England,</HI> he might do what he pleased, in
sending for his Officers and Soldiers, none of which he would keep against
their Wills; but whilst they served him, he pretended they should do
their Duty, and obey his Commands: And so I took my Leave of the Prince,
without going into the other Room, where the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> Mr.
<HI>Bentinck,</HI> and several General Officers were.</P>

<P><PB N="430" REF="452"/>Whilst I was in <HI>England,</HI> the
<HI>Marquis de Grana,</HI> who was Governour General of the <HI>Spanish
Netherlands,</HI> being not well in his Health, retired to <HI>Marimont</HI> in
<HI>Hennault,</HI> and after some Days Sickness, he died there by a great
Stoppage of Urine; and <HI>Don Antonio d'Agusto,</HI> who was then <HI>Maitre
de Camp Ge∣neral</HI> of the Army, was forthwith declared Governour <HI>pro
interim,</HI> wherein he behaved himself so well, that by the Interest of
the King my Master, and of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> he was confirmed
absolute Governour with all its Privileges, and continued Governour for Six
Years, and was then outed of his Govern∣ment by the Interest of the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> who was then more against him, than his High∣ness was
before for him; for finding he was made <HI>Marquis de Gastanaga,</HI> and
that he had a great and private Veneration for King <HI>James</HI> II. my
Master, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> thereupon used his utmost Endeavour
to out him of the Government of <HI>Flanders</HI>; and one of the Ar∣ticles
which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> sent to <HI>Ma∣drid</HI> against the
<HI>Marquis de Gastanaga,</HI> was, That he had held several private
Conferences with me, after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had sent me Letters
of Revocation from my Function of Envoy: But the King my Master did not
dis∣cover this till it was too late to remedy it; the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> being very averse to all that had any Veneration for my
Master <HI>James</HI> II. or that were Friends to his Majesty: And that the
<HI>Marquis de Gastanaga</HI> was his Majesty's <PB N="431" REF="453"/>
real, tho' secret Friend, may be seen by the Letters which he wrote to me,
whilst I was in <HI>England,</HI> in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
Rebel∣lion; and after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had dis∣charged me from
my Employment, he made Mr. <HI>Ekart,</HI> a <HI>Switzer,</HI> his Resident
at the Court of <HI>Brussels</HI>; who dying soon after, the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> made Mr. <HI>Wolseley</HI> his Envoy in the Court of
<HI>Brussels,</HI> where he continued for some Years; but he was found to
be a very lazy and unactive Man, and gave no Satisfaction to the Elector of
<HI>Bavaria,</HI> who succeeded the <HI>Marquis de Gastanaga,</HI> and
continued Governour during the Life of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> since
whose Death there hath been a great Change of Affairs by the Battle of
<HI>Ramillies,</HI> and most of <HI>Flanders</HI> is now reduced under the
Government of the Archduke <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst I was with King <HI>James</HI> my Royal Master, I
received many Letters from <HI>Don An∣tonio Agusto,</HI> who was then
Governour <HI>pro in∣terim</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> by which
it will appear how much he was in the Interest of the King my Master; the
first of which was of the 6th of <HI>July</HI> 1685.</P>
