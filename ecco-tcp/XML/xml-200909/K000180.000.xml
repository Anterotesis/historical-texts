<P>THE FASHIONABLE LOVER; A COMEDY: As it is acted at the
THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed for W. GRIFFIN, at GARRICK's HEAD, in
Catharine-Street, Strand. MDCCLXXII.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I COMMIT this Comedy to the press with all possible
gratitude to the Public for the reception it has met: I cannot flatter myself
that the same applause will follow it to the closet; for as it owed much
to an excellent representation, I have neither on this, nor any preceding
occasion, considered myself other∣wise than as a sharer only with the
Managers and Performers, who have distinguished them∣selves in the
exhibition of my trifling pro∣ductions. But it is not on the score of
spectacle only that I am obliged to Mr. Garrick; I am both in the instance
of this Comedy, and in that of the West Indian, materially indebted to his
judgment, and owe the good effect of many incidents in both to his
suggestion and advice: the correction of a real critic is as different from
that of a pre∣tender, as the operation of a surgeon from the stab of an
assassin.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>The Comedy, now submitted to the reader, is
design'd as an attempt upon his heart, and as such proceeds with little
deviation from mine; if it should be thought therefore, that I have meant
well, the charge of having ex∣ecuted indifferently I shall patiently submit
to: I have on this occasion, (as on the two preceding ones) wholly rested
my perform∣ance upon such poor abilities, as I am master of; I am not
conscious of having drawn any particular assistance, either in
respect of cha∣racter or design, from the productions of others; altho' I
am far from presuming to say or think, that I have ever exhibited any
cha∣racter purely original: The level manners of a polish'd country, like
this, do not supply much matter for the comic muse, which de∣lights in
variety and extravagance; where∣ever therefore I have made any attempts at
novelty, I have found myself obliged either to dive into the lower class of
men, or be∣take myself to the out-skirts of the empire; the center is too
equal and refined for such purposes.</P>
<P>Whether the reception of this Comedy may be such, as shall
encourage me to future efforts, is of small consequence to the public; 
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/> but if it should chance to obtain some little credit
with the candid part of mankind, and it's author for once escape without
those per∣sonal and unworthy aspersions, which writers, who hide their
own names, fling on them who publish their's, my success it may be hoped
will draw forth others to the undertaking with far superior requisites; and
that there are numbers under this description, whose sensibility keeps
'em silent, I am well per∣swaded when I consider how general it is for
men of the finest parts, to be subject to the finest feelings; and I
would submit whe∣ther this unhandsome practice of abuse, is not
calculated to create in the minds of men of genius, not only a disinclination
to en∣gage in dramatic compositions, but a languid and unanimated manner of
executing them: It will drive men from a necessary confidence in their own
powers, and it will be thought convenient to get out of the torrent's way, by
mooring under the lee of some great name, either French or Italian, and
sitting down contented with the humble, but less expo∣sed, task of
translation. Should this take place, a cold elaborate stile will prevail in
our drama, clearly opposite to the national <PB N="viii" REF="7"/> character,
and not at all at unison with the taste of our writers themselves.
Correctness will become the chief object in view, by which, though much may
be avoided, little will be obtained: nothing great can be ac∣complished on a
plain; turn to Shakespear, and you find the Alps not more irregular than his
genius; had the critics of his days marked his inaccuracies with that illiberal
spirit which seems reserved for our time, the bold and daring sallies
of the sublimest Muse would probably have been suppressed, and
neither the great Actor who has brought his scenes to life, nor the elegant
Essayist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Essay on the Genius and
Writings of Shakespear.</BIBL></NOTE> who has defended them, would have made
such display of their own genius in the celebration and protec∣tion of
his.</P>

<LG>
<L>I AM a devil, so please you—and must hoof</L>
<L>Up to the poet yonder with this proof:</L>
<L>I'd read it to you, but, in faith, 'tis odds</L>
<L>For one poor Devil to face so many Gods.</L>
<L>A ready imp I am, who kindly greets</L>
<L>Young authors with their first exploits in sheets;</L>
<L>While the Press groans, in place of dry-nurse stands,</L>
<L>And takes the bantling from the midwife's hands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If any author of prolific brains,</L>
<L>In this good company, feels labour-pains;</L>
<L>If any gentle poet, big with rhime,</L>
<L>Has run his reck'ning out and gone his time;</L>
<L>If any critic, pregnant with ill-nature,</L>
<L>Cries out to be deliver'd of his satire;</L>
<L>Know such that at our Hospital of Muses</L>
<L>He may lye in, in private, if he chuses;</L>
<L>We've single lodgings there for secret sinners,</L>
<L>With good encouragement for young beginners.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here's one now that is free enough in reason;</L>
<L>This bard breeds regularly once a season;</L>
<L>Three of a sort, of homely form and feature,</L>
<L>The plain coarse progeny of humble nature;</L>
<L>Home-bred and born; no strangers he displays,</L>
<L>Nor tortures free-born limbs in stiff French stays:</L>
<L><PB N="x" REF="9"/>Two you have rear'd; but between you and
me,</L>
<L>This youngest is the fav'rite of the three.</L>
<L>Nine tedious months he bore this babe about,</L>
<L>Let it in charity live nine nights out;</L>
<L>Stay but his month up; give some little law;</L>
<L>'Tis cowardly to attack him in the straw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear Gentlemen Correctors, be more civil;</L>
<L>Kind courteous Sirs, take counsel of the Devil;</L>
<L>Stop your abuse, for while your readers see</L>
<L>Such malice, they impute your works to me;</L>
<L>Thus, while you gather no one sprig of fame,</L>
<L>Your poor unhappy friend is put to shame:</L>
<L>Faith, Sirs, you shou'd have some consideration,</L>
<L>When ev'n the Devil pleads against Damnation.</L>

<LG>
<L>LADIES, your country's ornament and pride,</L>
<L>Ye, whom the nuptial deity has tied</L>
<L>In silken setters, will ye not impart</L>
<L>For pity's sake some portion of your art</L>
<L>To a mere novice, and prescribe some plan</L>
<L>How you would have me live with my good man?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell me, if I should give each passing hour</L>
<L>To love of pleasure or to love of power;</L>
<L>If with the fatal thirst of desperate play</L>
<L>I shou'd turn day to night and night to day;</L>
<L>Had I the faculty to make a prize</L>
<L>Of each pert animal that meets my eyes,</L>
<L>Say are these objects worth my serious aim;</L>
<L>Do they give happiness or health or fame?</L>
<L>Are hecatombs of lovers hearts of force</L>
<L>To deprecate the demons of divorce?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Speak, my advisers, shall I gain the plan</L>
<L>Of that bold club, which gives the law to man,</L>
<L>At their own weapons that proud sex defies</L>
<L>And sets up a new female paradise?</L>
<L>Lights for the ladies! Hark, the bar-bells sound!</L>
<L>Show to the club-room—See the glass goes
round—</L>
<L>Hail, happy meeting of the good and fair,</L>
<L>Soft relaxation from domestic care,</L>
<L>Where virgin minds are early train'd to loo,</L>
<L>And all Newmarket opens to the view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In these gay scenes shall I affect to move,</L>
<L>Or pass my hours in dull domestic love?</L>
<L>Shall I to rural solitudes descend</L>
<L>With Tyrrel my protector, guardian, friend,</L>
<L>Or to the rich Pantheon's round repair,</L>
<L>And blaze the brightest heathen-goddess there?</L>
<L>Where shall I six? Determine ye who know,</L>
<L>Shall I renounce my husband, or Soho?</L>
<L>With eyes half-open'd and an aking head</L>
<L>And ev'n the artificial roses dead,</L>
<L>When to my toilette's morning task resign'd,</L>
<L>What visitations then may seize my mind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Save me, just Heaven, from such a painful life,</L>
<L>And make me an unfashionable wife!</L>

Flourish of French horns.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>HOOT! fellows, haud your honds: pack up your damn'd clarinets,
and gang your gait, for a pair of lubberly minstrels, as you are. An you
cou'd hondle the bagpipe instead, I wou'd na' say you nay: ah! 'tis an
auncient instrument of great melody, and has whastled many a braw lad to
his grave; but your holidays horns there are fit only to play to a drunken
city-barge on a swan-hopping party up the Thames.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Jeu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fedon, Monsieur Colin, for why you have send away the horns?
It is very much the ton in this country for the fine gentlemens to have the
horns: upon my vord, my Lord this day give grand entertainment to very grand
company; tous les maccaroni below stairs, et toute la coterie above. Hark,
who vait dere? My Lord ring his bell.—Voi la, Monsieur Colin, dere is
all the company going to the tea-room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(looking out.)</STAGE>
<P> Now the de'el burst the weams of you all together, say I,
for a pack of locusts; a cow in a clover field has more moderation than the
best among you: <PB N="2" REF="13"/> had my lord Abberville the wealth of
Glasgow, you'd swallow it all down before you gee'd over.—Crom,
crom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Jeu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vat is dat crom, crom? We do not know in France vat is dat crom,
crom. But vat you say to the dinner? Upon my vord Monsieur the cook, make
as fine dispositions for the table, as the Grand Condé did for the
battle: ma foi, he merit to have his statue raised en crocan, in the center
of his own performance.</P>

<P>Colin, see that covers are laid for four-and-twenty, and
supper served at twelve in the great eating-parlour.</P>

<P>Ecod, my Lord, had you ken'd the mess of cakes and sweeties
that was honded up amongst 'em just now, you wou'd na' think there cou'd be

<P>What, fellow, wou'd you have me starve my guests?</P>

<P>Troth, an you don't, they'll go nigh to starve you.</P>

<P>Let me hear no more of this, Colin Macleod; I took you for my
servant, not for my adviser.</P>

where's the breach of duty in that?</P>

<P>What quoting, Mortimer? and satire too?—I thought you

<P>True; therefore, I'm returning home.—Good night to
you.</P>

philosopher want food to feast his spleen upon?</P>

<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Food! I revolt against the name; no Bramin cou'd abominate
your fleshly meal more than I do, why Hirtius and Apicius would have
blush'd for it: Marc Antony, who roasted eight whole boars for supper,
never massacred more at a meal than you have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce, good cynick: pr'ythee now get thee up stairs, and
take my place; the ladies will be glad of you at cards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me at cards! me at a quadrille-table; pent in with fuzzing
dowagers, gossiping old maids and yellow admirals; 'sdeath, my Lord
Abberville, you must excuse me</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out on thee, unconformable being, thou art a traitor to
society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you call that society?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but not my society; none such as you describe will be
found here; my circle, Mr. Mortimer, is form'd by people of the first
fashion and spirit in this country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fashion and spirit! Yes, their country's like to suffer by
their fashion more than 'twill ever profit by their spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, your temper is too sour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your's too sweet: a mawkish lump of manna; sugar in
the mouth, but physic to the bowels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Mortimer, you was my father's executor; I did not know your
office extended any further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; when I gave a clear estate into your hands, I clear'd
myself of an unwelcome office: I was, indeed, your father's executor; the
gentlemen of fashion and spirit will be your lordship's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! you've been black-ball'd at some paltry port-drinking
club; and set up for a man of wit and ridicule.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, believe me: your companions are too dull to laugh at, and
too vicious to expose.—There stands a sample of your choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, Doctor Druid? Where's the harm in him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is the merit?—What one quality does that old piece
of pedantry possess to fit him for the liberal office of travelling
preceptor to a man of rank? You know, my Lord, I recommended you a friend as
fit to form your <PB N="4" REF="15"/> manners as your morals; but he was a
restraint; and, in his stead, you took that Welchman, that buffoon, that
antiquarian forsooth, who looks as if you had rak'd him out of the cinders of
Mount Vesuvius.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I did: but pr'ythee, Mortimer, don't run away; I long
to have you meet.</P>

<P>You must excuse me.</P>

<P>Nay, I must have you better friends.—Come hither,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that's no objection, none in the least, fa∣shion
reconciles all those scruples: to consult your own ease in all things
is the very first article in the recipe for good breeding; when every man
looks after himself, no one can complain of neglect; but as these maxims
may not be orthodox on the eastern side of Temple-bar, you must stand
Gentleman Usher in this spot; put your best face upon the matter, and
marshal my citizens into the assem∣bly room, with as much ceremony, as if
they came up with an address from the whole company of Cordwainers.</P>

<P>Youv'e guest it; such a divine, delicious little devil,
lurks in my heart; Glendower himself cou'd not exorcise her: I am
possest, and from the hour I saw her by surprize, I have been
plotting methods how to meet her; a lucky opening offers, the mine is laid, and
Bridge∣more's visit is the signal for springing it.</P>

<P>Pridgemore's! how so?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, 'tis with him she lives; what else cou'd make it
difficult, and what but difficulty, cou'd make me pursue it? They prudently
enough wou'd have conceal'd her from me, for who can think of any other, when
Miss Aubrey is in sight?—But hark! they're come; I must

<P>Pless us, what hastes and hurries he is in, and all for

venerable antique: I never shall bring down his mercury, to touch the proper
freezing point, which that of a true virtuoso ought to stand at:
sometimes indeed he will contemplate a beautiful statue, as if it was a

<P>Yes truly, he's impatient for your coming, but you shall find
him not at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>How; not at home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mighty proof of his impatience, truly.</P>

<P>Why, 'twas some plaguy business took him out, but we'll
dispatch it out of hand, and wait upon you quickly.</P>

<P>Well, business, business must be done.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought my Lord had been a man of fashion, not of
business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so he is; a man of the first fashion; you can∣not have
a fresher sample: the worst gallant in nature is your maccaroni; with the
airs of a coquette you meet the manners of a clown: fear keeps him in some
awe be∣fore the men, but not one spark of passion has he at heart, to
remind him of the ladies.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what say you, Sir? you're glad to be at home;
nothing I warrant like old England. Ah I what's France, and Spain, and
Burgundy, and Flanders? no, old England for my money; 'tis worth all the world
besides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your pelly says as much; 'twill fill the pot, but starve the
prain; 'tis full of corn, and sheep, and villages, and people: England, to
the rest of the oorld, is like a flower-garden to a forest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but the people, Sir, what say you to the people?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing: I never meddle with the human species; man, living
man, is no object of my curiosity, nor ooman neither; at least, Mr.
Pridgemore, till she shall be made a mummies of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; you speak in the way of trade: money's
your object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Money and trade! I scorn 'em both; the beaten track of
commerce I disdain to follow: I've traced the Oxus, and the Ton; traversed
the Riphaean Moun∣tains, and pierced into the inmost Tesarts of Kalmuc
Tartary—follow trade indeed! no; Iv'e followed the ra∣vages of Kouli Chan
with rapturous delight: there is the land of wonders; finely depopulated;
gloriously laid waste; fields without a hoof to tread 'em, fruits without a
hand to gather 'em; with such a catalogue of pats, peetles, serpents,
scorpions, caterpillars, toads—oh! tis a recreating contemplation, to a
philosophic mind!</P>

<P>Out on 'em, filthy vermin, I hope you left 'em where you found
'em.</P>

<P>How I am watch'd in this house you well know, Mr. Tyrrel;
therefore you must not stay: what you have done and suffer'd for my

surmount your difficulties by the recovery of Lord Courtland: may your life
never be again exposed on my account!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I glory in protecting you; when he, or any other rake, repeats
the like offence, I shall repeat the like cor∣rection. I am now going to my
uncle Mortimer, who does not know that I am in town. Life is not life without
thee; never will I quit his feet, till I've obtain'd his voice for our

knows no happiness itself, nor feels complacency in that of others?</P>

<P>When you know Mr. Mortimer you'll find how totally the world

secure the door: 'twill not be amiss to bar this retreat. 
<STAGE>(Locks the door, and advances to the
glass-door.)</STAGE> Ay, there she is!—How pensive is that
posture!—Musing on her condition; which, in truth, is melancholy
enough; an humble cousin to a vulgar tyrant.—'Sdeath, she cannot
chuse but jump at my proposals.—See, she weeps.—I'm glad

strongest reasons for what I request.</P>

<P>Can you now in your heart suppose that Mor∣timer will let

<P>Oh, yes! I give you perfect credit for your inno∣cence; the
hour, the place, your Lordship's character, the Lady's composure, all are
innocence itself. Can't you affect a little surprize, Ma'am, at finding a
Gentleman in your bed-room, though you placed him there yourself? So
excellent an actress might pretend a fit on the occasion: Oh, you have not
half your part.</P>

<P>Indeed, Miss Bridgemore, you look upon this in too serious a
light.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, be assured: I'm charmed with your ad∣dress; you are a
perfect fashionable lover: so agree∣able to invite us to your house, so
well bred to be from home, and so considerate to visit poor Miss Aubrey
in our absence: altogether, I am puzzled which to prefer, your wit,
politeness, or your honour.</P>

resign yourself to my protection; you shall face your tyrant, out-face
her, shine above her, put her down in splendor as in beauty; be no more the
servile thing her cruelty has made you; but be the life, the leader of each
public pleasure, the envy of all womankind, the mistress of my
happiness—</P>

<P>And murderer of my own. No, no, my Lord, I'll perish first:
the last surviving orphan of a noble house, I'll not disgrace it: from
these mean, unfeeling people, who to the bounty of my ancestors owe all
they have, I shall expect no mercy; but you, whom even pride might teach
some virtue, you to tempt me, you with unmanly cunning to seduce
distress yourself created, sinks you deeper in contempt than Heaven
sinks me in poverty and shame.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my story, Sir; I drew my sword in the defence of
innocence: to punish and repel the libertine attempts of an ennobled ruffian;

honour covers all your faults, as that of passion all your follies.</P>

<P>Honour is what mankind have made it: and as we hold our lives
upon these terms, with our lives it behoves us to defend them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have made it reason then it seems, make it religion too,
and put it out of fashion with the world at once: of this be sure, I had
sooner cast my guineas in the sea, than give 'em to a duellist. But
come, Frank, you are one from prejudice, not principle; therefore we'll talk no

lasting one; it should be, therefore, a delibe∣rate one: but let me see
your girl; I'm a sour fellow; so the world thinks of me; but it is

<P>Whence learn you that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>From little Napthali of St. Mary Axe: when a man borrows money
of a Jew, 'tis a presumption no Chris∣tian can be found to lend him
any.</P>

<P>Hoot! know you not that every losing gamester has his Jew?
He is your only doctor in a desperate case; when the regulars have brought
you to Death's door, the quack is invited to usher you in.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Jew, Colin, in the present case, savours more of the

you have effects.</P>

<P>You've hit the nail o' the hede; my Laird will sign to any
thing; there's bonds, and blanks, and bar∣gains, and promisary notes, and a
damn'd sight of rogue∣ries, depend on't. Ecod he had a bundle for his
break∣fast, as big as little Napthali cou'd carry; I wou'd it had braken his
bock; and yet he is na' half the knave of yon fat fellow upon Fish-street
Hill.</P>

<P>Ay, ay, he's at the bottom of the plot; this little Hebrew's
only his jackall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>I comprehend you; Bridgemore, under cover of this Jew, has been
playing the usurer with Lord Abber∣ville, and means to pay his daughter's
portion in parch∣ment; this must be prevented.</P>

<P>Troth, Maister Mortimer I canna' satisfy you on that hede;
but yesternight the job was done; methought the business never had a
kindly aspect from the first.</P>

<P>Well, as my Lord has got rid of Miss, I think he may very well
spare her fortune.</P>

<P>Odzooks, but that's no reason he shou'd lose his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Colin, may be past my power to hinder; yet even that
shall be attempted: find out the Jew that Bridgemore has employ'd, and bring
him hither, if you can.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="17" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone for that; there never was a Jew since Samson's
time that Colin cou'd na' deal with; an' he hangs bock, and will na' follow
kindly, troth, I'll lug him to you by the ears; ay, will I, and his Maister
the fat fellow into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, leave me to deal with Bridgemore; I'll scare away that

<P>Nay, my good friend, come in. 
<STAGE>(COLIN enters.)</STAGE> This honest man was my
conductor: while you, Lord Abberville, in a distinguish'd rank are openly
assaulting innocence, he, in his humble post is secretly supporting
it.—If you come under that de∣scription, Madam, I am your defender; if
not, I have no further business here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why shou'd I urge my innocence? I am unfor∣tunate, I'm poor:
your nephew, Sir, will tell you that is cause sufficient for abandoning
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>This grows too serious; I scorn to steal that from you
half my fortune could not purchase. I believe you are as innocent as Heaven
first form'd you; and to con∣vince the world in what esteem I hold your
virtues, here, before Mortimer, I offer you my hand, and lay my title, rank and
fortune, at your feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, there may be a legal prostitute as well as a licentious
one; had you a world to give, after your base experiment, you cannot offer
any thing that I shall take. You may find others less exceptious; but in a
noble fa∣mily, though stripp'd of fortune, there will still be pride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see my fate; I see a prepossession in your heart
too strong for me to shake: I plainly perceive that Mr. Tyrrel can offend
with more impunity than I can; however, Mortimer, you are a man of honour; I
resign Miss Aubrey into your hands for the present, and shall expect
you will avail yourself of no unfair advantages over me.—Macleod, I
find Miss Aubrey is to thank you for this seasonable visit of Mr.
Mortimer's.</P>

<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!—Mr. Mortimer! You'll pardon me, but must I think
you serious? If what you now propose is meant in kindness to me, I must
say the world has not done justice to your character: I have been taught to
look upon you as no friend to our sex in particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor am I; your sex have broke treaty with us, pass'd the
bounds betwixt us, forc'd into our very taverns, and from being once the glory
of my country are become it's shame.</P>
</SP>

<P>But all have not done this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nor am I then at enmity with all; a virtuous individual is of no

<P>No country? Hoot! A true North Briton will give up his virtue
afore his country at any time.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes and I think it was a partiality to your country rather than
to virtue, which determin'd you to put me into this house.</P>

<P>De'il take me now and all may kindred with me, if I knew ought
about the house, more than the name of Macintosh upon the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time will clear all things up: a general mis∣conception is
gone forth; my nephew I perceive has fallen under it. As for poor Colin, his
design in bringing you hither was more than innocent, depend upon it, it was
noble; I have heard his story and at my request he brings me here: commit
yourself therefore to my protection and rely upon my justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall I answer you? Your generosity o'er∣whelms
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>I generous! No, I am a meer voluptuary; I study luxury by
principle, and am as sensual on the side of virtue, as Abberville, or any
other fashionable rake, on that of vice.—Colin, you'll settle matters
with your countrywoman and come to us at my house.</P>
<STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>My countrywoman! The fiend a bit! I never will believe she has
a drop of Scottish blude in aw her composition; as I shall answer I
never blush'd before for any of the name: there must be something
spurious in her genealogy: I'll have a little serious talk with her on
that; I've got the pedigree of the Macintoshes at my fingers ends, and if
there's e'er a flaw in her descent 'twixt this and Noah, gadzooks, I'll wager

<P>IF Bridgemore has'nt shifted his abode, that is the house;
'twas there that eighteen years ago I lost a wife, and left an infant
daughter. All-disposing Providence, who hast ordain'd me to this hour,
and thro' innumerable toils and dangers led me back to this affecting spot,
can it be wonder'd at, if I approach it with an anxious aching heart, uncertain
as I am if I have still a child or not? What shall I do? If my Augusta's
lost, 'twere better I should never enter those ill-omen'd doors; if she
survives, how shall I disclose my∣self, and tell her she has
still a father? Oh, that unknown and unperceiv'd, I cou'd but catch a sight
of her, gaze till I'd gratified my longing, and till this throbbing might
abate! I'll watch the door till somebody comes out, that I may speak to.

<P>Aw that he owns I know; what base begotten brats he may haue

<P>You misconceive me, honest friend; has no young Lady of the

<P>In virtue, Sir, nought else, and that will not pass current

<P>Who is Mr. Mortimer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Maister Mortimer is one who does a thou∣sand noble acts
without the credit of one; his tongue wounds and his heart makes whole; he
must be known and not describ'd: an' you will bait a-while in yonder tavern
till I come from Bradgemore's, I'll accompany you to where your daughter
is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed! I fear I've been mistaken in this Bridge∣more; three
years ago I consign'd to him a cargo of great value from Scanderoon; if he
has robb'd me—but till I've seen my daughter, I'll suspend enquiry.
Step with me into yonder tavern, there we'll concert the means of bringing
Bridgemore to an interview at Mr. Mortimer's. Come, my good benefactor, how
fortunate was this meet∣ing! I long to know to whom I owe this happiness.</P>

gratification from it; so that Augusta had but one lover less, I care not
if she had forty fathers living: Tyrrel's the man of her heart, and in truth
he is an object worthy any woman's prefer∣ence; if I cou'd draw him from her

<P>Sir, your most humble servant. Can you forgive the

<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>A stranger, Sir, is welcome: I cannot always say as much to
an acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I plainly see your experience of mankind by the value you put
upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir; I've visited the world from arctic to ecliptic, as
a surgeon does a hospital, and find all men sick of some distemper:
the impertinent part of mankind are so busy, the busy so impertinent,
and both so incurably ad∣dicted to lying, cheating and betraying, that their
case is desperate: no corrosive can eat deep enough to bottom the
corruption.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="60"/>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, with such good store of mental pro∣vision about
you, you may stand out a siege against society; your books are
companions you never can be tir'd of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly their company is more tolerable, than that of their
authors wou'd be; I can bear them on my shelves, tho' I shou'd be sorry
to see the impertinent puppies, who wrote them: however, Sir, I can quarrel
with my books too, when they offend my virtue or my reason.—But I'm
taking up your time; the honest Scotch∣man, who announc'd you, told me you
had something of importance to communicate to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have: I'm told I am your debtor, and I came with a design to
pay you down such thanks as your bene∣volence well merits; but I perceive
already you are one, whom great professions wou'd annoy, whose principle
is virtue, and whose retribution rises from within.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, no more of this; if you have any thing to request,
propose it: I'd rather much be told what I may do for you, than reminded of
what I may have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I readily believe you, and according to your hu∣mour will
address you: I own you may confer a benefit upon me; 'tis in your power, Mr.
Mortimer, to make me happiest of all mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me your hand; why now you speak good sense; I like
this well: let us do good, Sir, and not talk about it: show me but how I may
give happiness to you, with innocence to myself, and I shall be the
person under obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>This then it is; you have a young person under your

<P>You're insolent, or grossly ignorant, to think I wou'd
betray a trust, a sacred trust: she is a ward of vir∣tue; 'tis from

think to make a traitor of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your zeal does honour to you; yet if you persist in it, and
spite of my protest hold out, your constancy will be no virtue; it must
take another name.</P>

<P>Do I live?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, in my heart, while I have life or memory; that dear injur'd
girl, whom you so honourably protect, is my daughter. The overflowings of a
father's heart bless and reward you! You whom I know not, and that poor
Highlander, out of his small pittance, have under Provi∣dence prerserv'd my
child; whilst Bridgemore, whom I rais'd from penury, and trusted with the
earnings of my travel, has abandoned and defrauded her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>O mother Nature, thou'lt compel me to for∣swear thee.</P>

<P>Ah, Sir, you feel the villainy of man in every vein; I am more
practised, and behold it only with a sigh: Colin and I have laid a little
plot to draw this Bridgemore hither; he believes me dead, and thinks he is to
meet a person at your house, who can relate particulars of my death, in
which case it is clear he means to sink a capital consign∣ment I sent
him about three years since, and turn my daughter on the world.</P>

<P>Was ever the like heard? Pray whence do you <PB N="49" REF="62"/>
derive pretensions to Miss Aubrey? Tell me in presence of this

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not from my own deservings I confess; yet if an ardent,
firm, disinterested passion, sanctified withal by her consent, can
recommend me, I am not without some title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you there now: this fellow you shall know, Sir, is my
nephew; my sister's son; a child of fortune.—Hark'e, with what face
do you talk of love, who are not worth a groat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have allow'd me, Sir, to talk of love; openly, beneath your
eye I have solicited Miss Aubrey's consent and gain'd it; as for my
poverty, in that I glory, for therein I resemble her whom I adore; and I
shou'd hope, tho' for∣tune has not favour'd us, we have not lost our title
to the rights of nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! the rights of nature! While you enjoy it's rights, how
will you both provide against its wants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your bounty hitherto has let me feel no wants; and shou'd it
be your pleasure to withdraw it, thanks to Pro∣vidence, the world is not so
scantily provided but it can give to honest industry a daily dinner.</P>

<P>Fine words! But I'll appeal to this good Gen∣tleman; let him
decide betwixt us.</P>

<P>In truth, young gentleman, your uncle has good reason on his
side; and was I he, I never wou'd consent to your alliance

brought a fortune large enough to keep you both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are your maxims I've no doubt; they only prove to me
that you love money more than beauty, gene∣rosity or honour.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is your Lady in possession of all these? Let me be
made acquainted with her, and perhaps I may come over to your sentiments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Frank, go, fetch your girl, and let my friend here see
her; I'm in earnest. Upon my honour, nephew, till you've gain'd this
Gentleman's consent, you never can have mine; so go your ways and let us
see if you have interest enough to bring her hither.</P>

Look at that girl; 'tis thus mortality encounters happiness; 'tis thus the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Save you Sir, save you; is it true I pray you that a learned
Gentleman, a traveller but just arrived, is now with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a person under that description in my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>May he be seen, good now? may he be talk'd with? what has he
brought home? is he well stor'd with oriental curiosities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Sir, indifferent well; he has brought a con∣siderable
parcel of sun-dried bricks from the ruins of an∣tient Babylon; a heavy
collection of ores from the mines of Siberia, and a pretty large cargo of
common salt from the banks of the Caspian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inestimable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, mere ballast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ballast indeed, and what discoveries does he draw from all
these?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he has discover'd that the bricks are not 
<PB N="55" REF="68"/> fit for building; the mines not worth the working, and the
salt not good for preserving: in short, Doctor, he has no taste for
these trifles; he has made the human heart his study; he loves his own
species, and does not care if the whole race of butterflies was extinct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, putterflies—'tis in my mind, d'ye see, what you
have said about my putterflies: 'tis upon my memory; but no matter—your
studies Mr. Mortimer, and mine, are wide asunder.—But go
on—reform the world, you'll find it a tough task; I am content to take
it as I find it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>While the sun shines, you'll carry a candle; how will that
light them, who travel in the night? Away with such philosophers, here
comes an honest man, and that's a character worth ten on't.— 
<STAGE>(COLIN enters.)</STAGE> So, Colin, what's the news with
you? If I'm to augur from your countenance, something goes wrong at your
house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Troth, Sir, no mighty matter; only Laird Ab∣berville has turn'd
away a troublesome fellow, who bore your honour grete gude will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is't you tell me? is my Lord determined upon ruin, that he
puts away the only honest man be∣longing to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this coot light, and that is well remem∣ber'd; look'e, I've
got your wages: come, hold out your hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Axcuse me, I'll ha' none on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wages? why 'tis all coot money; 'tis in full. What, man,
think better on't; you'll want it when you get to Scotland, ten to one
else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enow, but by my sol I'll touch na filler; he has geen a
title to me, which I hanna merited, Heav'n knows, nor ever shall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>What title has he given you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Saving your presence it ha' pleas'd my Laird to say, I am a
rascall; but I'll na wear a rascall's wages in a scottish pouch: de'il
o' my soul, I'd sooner eat my stroud for famine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think thou woud'st, but wait a while with pa∣tience; this
rash young man's affairs press to a crisis; I have yet one effort more to
make, which if it fails I sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>

<P>Lord Abberville, Sir, desires to speak with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well. Colin, go you with honest Jarvis. Doctor, for
once let us unite our studies in this cause, come you with me; if my advice
can rescue your unhappy pupil from a course of guilty occupations, your
philosophy may furnish harmless ones to fill their place: make haste;
make haste, here come the Bridgemores.</P>

<P>Please to walk in here; my master will wait upon you

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody here!—Hark'e, friend, I expected to meet a
stranger; a gentleman just landed from Scanderoon. Know you of such a
one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is now in the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>

<P>He is; they both will wait upon you presently.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That's well, that's well; as for old furly-boots we cou'd well
spare his company; 'tis a strange dogged fellow, and execrated by all
mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank Heaven, he is a man one seldom meets; I little thought
of ever setting foot in his house: I hope the savage won't grow
ceremonious and return the visit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Unless he brings his nephew in his hand.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ladies, you do me honour. Mr. Bridgemore, you come here upon a
mechancholy errand—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, but death you know is common to all men; I look'd to
meet a gentleman here—this is all lost time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>True: therefore before he comes, let us fill it up with
something more material: I have a business to propose to you, which I
consider as my own. You must know, Sir, I've a nephew.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mind that, Lucy, he is opening his com∣mission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Law, Ma'am, you put me into such a flutter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a certain Lady, Mr. Bridgemore, whom, on this
occasion, you must father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>How tedious he is! Coudn't he as well have nam'd my
daughter?—Well, Sir, what are your expecta∣tions from that Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nothing but what you can readily supply: I know no good
thing she stands in want of, but a for∣tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and who doubts but on a proper occa∣sion I shall give
her one? Ay, and a tolerable fortune too, Mr. Mortimer, as times go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fortune you was to have given my ward, Lord Abberville, will
just suffice: I think the sum was forty thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you speak out at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>'That ever been my custom; I abominate long sleepy
processes; life don't allow of 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hear nothing on your part; Mr. Tyrrel, as I take it, is
wholly dependant on your bounty—besides, affairs, as I conceive, are
yet scarce ripe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, pappa, you're very much mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Mr. Mortimer, the parties shou'd at least be
suffer'd to consult each other's inclina∣tions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means; let 'em speak for themselves: 'tis their own
cause, and they will plead it best: hark'e, come in, Sir, these are the
parties.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>TYRRELL and MISS AUBREY enter.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>What ails you; have you trod upon a thorn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishing assurance! Augusta here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: Francis Tyrrel and Augusta Aubrey. Do the names offend
you? Look at the parties, are they not well match'd? Examine them, they'll tell
you they're agreed. Who shall forbid their union?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who cares about it? If Mr. Tyrrel and the Lady 
<PB N="68" REF="71"/> are agreed, that's enough: I suppose it is not
necessary for us to be present at the ceremony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, I pray you, where's the occasion for us to be call'd
in, because your nephew chuses to take up with an unworthy girl, that I
once harbour'd upon charity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your audacious tongue: let conscience keep you
silent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush, hush! you frighten me; pray be compos'd; and let me
own that no injustice, no severity can wholly cancel what I owe to Mr.
Bridgemore for his past pro∣tection, and that share of education he allow'd
me; but when he puts this to the account of charity, he takes a virtue foreign
to his heart, and only aggravates the shame that's falling on him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the man thunder-struck; why don't you answer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charity keeps him silent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, let's begone: her words have daggers in 'em, and her looks
are poison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before you go, Miss Bridgemore, suffer me to ask, when you
related Lord Abberville's adventure to Mr. Tyr∣rel, why you suppress'd the
evidence of your own maid, who conducted him into my chamber?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Aubrey, if it ever is your fate to have a rival, you will
find an answer to that question.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit. with Mrs. Bridgemore.</STAGE>

<P>Hold, you and I, Sir, must not part.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, your pleasure?</P>

present at.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, Mr. Bridgemore, you that harbour'd my Augusta upon
charity, I shall leave my uncle to discharge my obligations to you on that
score, together with his own.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, we're now alone; and if it needs must be that one
of us shall come to shame, 'tis well we are so. It is thought I am a hard
unfeeling man; let it be so: you shall have justice notwithstanding:
innocence requires no more. You are accus'd; defend yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accus'd of what; and who is my accuser?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man; and you shall face him like a man. Who waits? 
<STAGE>(A Servant enters.)</STAGE> Desire the stranger to 
<PB N="59" REF="72"/> come hither 
<STAGE>(exit Servant.)</STAGE> Fear nothing; we're enough to try
this question; where the human heart is present, and the appeal is made to
Heaven, no jury need be sum∣moned. Here is a stranger has the confidence to
say that your pretensions to charity are false; nay, he arraigns your
honesty; a charge injurious to any man, but mortal to a trader, and levell'd
at the vital root of his profession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, 'tis the Turky merchant I suppose; let him come in; I
know upon what ground I stand, and am afraid of no man living.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>To thy confusion—Rais'd by the bounty of my family, is
this your gratitude? When in the bitterness of my distress I put an
infant daughter in your hands, the last weak scyon of a noble stock, was
it to rob me you received her? To plunder and defraud an helpless orphan, as
you thought her, and rise upon the ruins of your benefactor's fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I am trepann'd! How shall I look my wife and daughter in
the face 
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where have you lodg'd the money I deposited with you at
parting? I find my daughter destitute: what have you done with the
remittances I sent from time to time? But above all, where is the produce of
the Nep∣tune's cargo? Villain, look here, I have the proofs; this is the
abstract of the sale; if you dispute it, I am here provided with a
witness, your Jew broker, ready at hand to attest it to your face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Expose me not; I will refund to the last far∣thing: I
dispute nothing; call him not in.</P>

guilty.</P>

her knees to her Father.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, upon my knees I do beseech you miti∣gate your
severity; it is my first petition; he's detected, let his conscience add
the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, my beloved child, it shall be so. There, Sir, your
pardon be your punishment; it was my money only you attempted, my choicest
treasure you have left untouch'd: now go and profit by this meeting: I will
not expose you: learn of your fraternity a more honour∣able practice; and let
integrity for ever remain the inse∣parable characteristic of an English
merchant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay; I've another point to settle with you; you're a creditor
of Lord Abberville's: I find you've put Miss Aubrey's money to extraordinary
interest: Jarvis, shew this Gentleman into my library, you'll find a lawyer
there will settle your accounts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bridge.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you've pretty well done that already—A fine
visit truly I have made on't; and a fine reception I shall meet at
home.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Abberville? You frighten me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear nothing; you will find him a new man; a deep incision has
let out the disorder; and I hope a healthy regimen in time will heal the
wound; in short I can't be idle; and now Frank is off my hands, I've once
more un∣dertaken to set this ricketty babe of quality upon his legs—Oh,
here he comes; why this is as it should be; now you look like friends.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>May we be ever so! O, Mortimer, I blush to look upon that

chide me, I should sink with shame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>You've nothing, my Lord Abberville, to appre∣hend from me: I
should be loth to give an interruption to your happiness in the height of
my own.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me thy hand, Augusta—In the hope that I was
labouring for thy sake, and in thy person that I shou'd restore the
prostrate fortunes of an ancient house, I have toiled on through eighteen
years of wearisome ad∣venture: crown'd with success, I now at length
return, and find my daughter all my fondest hope could represent; but
past experience makes me provident; I would secure my treasure; I would
bestow it now in faithful hands—What say you, Sir, will you accept
the charge? 
<STAGE>(To Tyrrel.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and will bear it ever in my sight, watch over it with
unremitting love, and guard it with my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>What says my child, my dear Augusta? But I read her
looks—Blest be you both!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amen, say I. Live an example to the age; and when I read the
list of marriages, as I do that of burials, with a sigh, let me have this
to say, that there was one example of felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Frank, 'tis hard to speak the word, but you deserve her;
yours is the road to happiness; I have been lost in error, but I shall
trace your steps and press to overtake you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's well said; there spoke your father from within
you: now begone; fly to the altars of your country lares; visit that nurse
of contemplation, solitude; and while you range your groves, that shook at
every rattle of the dice, ask of your reason, why you was a gamester.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've been a madman; I have lost an humble faithful friend,
whose services wou'd be invaluable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why ay, your Highlander, your poor Macleod; our plan must
stop without his help; I'm but a projector, he must execute—but there
likewise I can serve you.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Mortimer, how much have I mistaken thee!</P>
</SP>

<P>Come, come, I have my faults; I'm an un∣toward fellow, and
stand as much in need of a reform as any of you all.</P>

<STAGE>DOCTOR DRUID enters hastily, followed by COLIN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tutor me truly—talk to me! Pray, Gen∣tlemens, bear
witness: is Master Colins here a proper teacher of the dialects, d'ye
see, and pronunciations of the English tongue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="62" REF="75"/>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Is there not Duncan Ross of Aberdeen that lactures
twice a week in oratory at the Seven Dials? and does not Sawney Ferguson, a
cousin of mine awn, administer the English language in it's utmost
elegance at Amsterdam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bear witness, that is all I say, bear wit∣ness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>We do; there is not one amongst us, Doctor, but can witness
to some noble act of Colin's; and we wou'd not wound his harmless vanity,
for any bribe that you can offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colin, I've done you wrong; but I was not myself; be you no
worse a servant than you have been, and you shall find henceforward I
will be a better master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm satisfied; an you'll neglect yoursall na more than I
shall do, things will gang well enow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must apologize to Colin too; like my Lord Ab∣berville, I was
not myself when I rebuff'd you on the business of Miss Aubrey's
letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, Maister Tyrrel; 'tis not for a mon to resent
the pertness of a child, or the petulance of a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what shall I say to him? where shall I find words to
thank him as I ought?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I father all your obligations; 'twas not you but me his bounty
sav'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir, in point of obligation I stand first. By how much
there is more disgrace in doing than in suffering a violence, by so much
I am more his debtor than you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod and that is true enow; Heaven sends mis∣fortune, but
the De'il sends mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Master Colins, all is past and over; you have got your
place again, and all is well. Coot now, let me admonish you for the future to
be quiet and hear reason; moderate your choler and your passions and your
partialities: it is not for a clown like you to prattle and dispute with me;
in fait you shou'd know better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, 'tis you that shou'd know better; in this poor
Higlander the force of prejudice has some plea, because he is a clown; but
you, a citizen that shou'd be of the world, whose heart philosophy and
travel might <PB N="63" REF="76"/> have open'd, shou'd know better than to
join the cry with those, whose charity, like the limitation of a brief,
stops short at Berwick, and never circulates beyond the Tweed. By Heaven,
I'd rather weed out one such unmanly pre∣judice from the hearts of my
countrymen, than add another Indies to their empire.</P>
