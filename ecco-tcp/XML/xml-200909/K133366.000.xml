<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Work is delivered to the world as the first of a series of performances, which the favorable reception of this will induce the Writer to publish. His purpose is neither selfish nor temporary, but aims at the illustration of some im∣portant branches of the moral constitution of man. Whether this tale will be classed with the ordinary or frivolous sources of amusement, or be ranked with the few productions whose usefulness secures to them a lasting reputation, the reader must be permitted to decide.</P>
<P>The incidents related are extraordinary and rare. Some of them, perhaps, approach as nearly to the nature of miracles as can be done by that which is not truly miraculous. It is hoped that intelligent readers will not disapprove of the man∣ner in which appearances are solved, but that the solution will be sound to correspond with the known principles of human nature. The power which the principal person is said to pos∣sess can scarcely be denied to be real. It must be acknowledged to be extremely rare; but no fact, equally uncommon, is sup∣ported by the same strength of historical evidence.</P>
<P>Some readers may think the conduct of the younger Wie∣land impossible. In support of its possibility the Writer must appeal to Physicians and to men conversant with the latent springs and occasional perversions of the human mind. It will not be objected that the instances of similar delusion are rare, because it is the business of moral painters to exhibit their sub∣ject in its most instructive and memorable forms. If history furnishes one parallel fact, it is a sufficient vindication of the Writer; but most readers will probably recollect an authentic case, remarkably similar to that of Wieland.</P>
<P>It will be necessary to add, that this narrative is addressed, in an epistolary form, by the Lady whose story it contains, to a small number of friends, whose curiosity, with regard to it, had been greatly awakened. It may likewise be mentioned, that these events took place between the conclusion of the French and the beginning of the revolutionary war. The memoirs of Carwin, alluded to at the conclusion of the work. will be published or suppressed according to the reception which is given to the present attempt.</P>

<HEAD>WIELAND; OR THE TRANSFORMATION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I Feel little reluctance in complying with your request. You know not fully the cause of my sorrows. You are a stranger to the depth of my distresses. Hence your efforts at consolation must necessarily fail. Yet the tale that I am going to tell is not intended as a claim upon your sympathy. In the midst of my despair, I do not disdain to con∣tribute what little I can to the benefit of mankind. I acknowledge your right to be informed of the events that have lately happened in my family. Make what use of the tale you shall think proper. If it be communicated to the world, it will incul∣cate the duty of avoiding deceit. It will exemplify the force of early impressions, and show the im∣measurable evils that flow from an erroneous or imperfect discipline.</P>
<P>My state is not destitute of tranquillity. The sentiment that dictates my feelings is not hope. Futurity has no power over my thoughts. To all that is to come I am perfectly indifferent. With
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
regard to myself, I have nothing more to fear. Fate has done its worst. Henceforth, I am callous to misfortune.</P>
<P>I address no supplication to the Deity. The power that governs the course of human affairs has chosen his path. The decree that ascertained the condition of my life, admits of no recal. No doubt it squares with the maxims of eternal equity. That is neither to be questioned nor denied by me. It suf∣fices that the past is exempt from mutation. The storm that tore up our happiness, and changed into dreariness and desert the blooming scene of our ex∣istence, is lulled into grim repose; but not until the victim was transfixed and mangled; till every obstacle was dissipated by its rage; till every rem∣nant of good was wrested from our grasp and ex∣terminated.</P>
<P>How will your wonder, and that of your com∣panions, be excited by my story! Every sentiment will yield to your amazement. If my testimony were without corroborations, you would reject it as incredible. The experience of no human being can furnish a parallel: That I, beyond the rest of mankind, should be reserved for a destiny without alleviation, and without example! Listen to my narrative, and then say what it is that has made me deserve to be placed on this dreadful eminence, if, indeed, every faculty be not suspended in wonder that I am still alive, and am able to relate it.</P>
<P>My father's ancestry was noble on the paternal side; but his mother was the daughter of a mer∣chant. My grand-father was a younger brother, and a native of Saxony. He was placed, when he had reached the suitable age, at a German college. During the vacations, he employed himself in tra∣versing the neighbouring territory. On one occa∣sion
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
it was his fortune to visit Hamburg. He formed an acquaintance with Leonard Weise, a merchant of that city, and was a frequent guest at his house. The merchant had an only daughter, for whom his guest speedily contracted an affection; and, in spite of parental menaces and prohibitions, he, in due season, became her husband.</P>
<P>By this act he mortally offended his relations. Thenceforward he was entirely disowned and re∣jected by them. They refused to contribute any thing to his support. All intercourse ceased, and he received from them merely that treatment to which an absolute stranger, or detested enemy, would be entitled.</P>
<P>He found an asylum in the house of his new fa∣ther, whose temper was kind, and whose pride was flattered by this alliance. The nobility of his birth was put in the balance against his poverty. Weise conceived himself, on the whole, to have acted with the highest discretion, in thus disposing of his child. My grand-father found it incumbent on him to search out some mode of independent subsistence. His youth had been eagerly devoted to literature and music. These had hitherto been cultivated merely as sources of amusement. They were now converted into the means of gain. At this period there were few works of taste in the Saxon dialect. My ancestor may be considered as the founder of the German Theatre. The modern poor of the same name is sprung from the same fa∣mily, and, perhaps, surpasses but little, in the fruit∣fulness of his invention, or the soundness of his taste, the elder Wieland. His life was spent in the composition of sonatas and dramatic pieces. They were not unpopular, but merely afforded him a scanty subsistence. He died in the bloom of his life,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
and was quickly followed to the grave by his wife. Their only child was taken under the protection of the merchant. At an early age he was apprenticed to a London trader, and passed seven years of mer∣cantile servitude.</P>
<P>My father was not fortunate in the character of him under whose care he was now placed. He was treated with rigor, and full employment was pro∣vided for every hour of his time. His duties were laborious and mechanical. He had been educated with a view to this profession, and, therefore, was not tormented with unsatisfied desires. He did not hold his present occupations in abhorrence, because they withheld him from paths more flowery and more smooth, but he found in unintermitted labour, and in the sternness of his master, sufficient occa∣sions for discontent. No opportunities of recrea∣tion were allowed him. He spent all his time pent up in a gloomy apartment, or traversing narrow and crowded streets. His food was coarse, and his lodging humble.</P>
<P>His heart gradually contracted a habit of morose and gloomy reflection. He could not accurately define what was wanting to his happiness. He was not tortured by comparisons drawn between his own situation and that of others. His state was such as suited his age and his views as to fortune. He did not imagine himself treated with extraordinary or unjustifiable rigor. In this respect he supposed the condition of others, bound like himself to mercan∣tile service, to resemble his own; yet every en∣gagement was irksome, and every hour tedious in its lapse.</P>
<P>In this state of mind he chanced to light upon a book written by one of the teachers of the Albi∣genses, or French Protestants. He entertained no
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
relish for books, and was wholly unconscious of any power they possessed to delight or instruct. This volume had lain for years in a corner of his garret, half buried in dust and rubbish. He had marked it as it lay; had thrown it, as his occasions required, from one spot to another; but had felt no inclination to examine its contents, or even to in∣quire what was the subject of which it treated.</P>
<P>One Sunday afternoon, being induced to retire for a few minutes to his garret, his eye was attract∣ed by a page of this book, which, by some acci∣dent, had been opened and placed full in his view. He was seated on the edge of his bed, and was em∣ployed in repairing a rent in some part of his clothes. His eyes were not confined to his work, but occa∣sionally wandering, lighted at length upon the page. The words "Seek and ye shall find," were those that first offered themselves to his notice. His cu∣riosity was roused by these so far as to prompt him to proceed. As soon as he finished his work, he took up the book and turned to the first page. The further he read, the more inducement he found to continue, and he regretted the decline of the light which obliged him for the present to close it.</P>
<P>The book contained an exposition of the doc∣trine of the sect of Camissards, and an historical account of its origin. His mind was in a state pe∣culiarly fitted for the reception of devotional senti∣ments. The craving which had haunted him was now supplied with an object. His mind was at no loss for a theme of meditation. On days of busi∣ness, he rose at the dawn, and retired to his cham∣ber not till late at night. He now supplied himself with candles, and employed his nocturnal and Sun∣day hours in studying this book. It, of course, abounded with allusions to the Bible. All its con∣clusions
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
were deduced from the sacred text. This was the fountain, beyond which it was unnecessary to trace the stream of religious truth; but it was his duty to trace it thus far.</P>
<P>A Bible was easily procured, and he ardently entered on the study of it. His understanding had received a particular direction. All his reveries were fashioned in the same mould. His progress towards the formation of his creed was rapid. Every fact and sentiment in this book were viewed through a medium which the writings of the Ca∣missard apostle had suggested. His constructions of the text were hasty, and formed on a narrow scale. Every thing was viewed in a disconnected position. One action and one precept were not employed to illustrate and restrict the meaning of another. Hence arose a thousand scruples to which he had hitherto been a stranger. He was alter∣nately agitated by fear and by ecstacy. He ima∣gined himself beset by the snares of a spiritual foe, and that his security lay in ceaseless watchfulness and prayer.</P>
<P>His morals, which had never been loose, were now model'ed by a stricter standard. The empire of religious duty extended itself to his looks, gestures, and phrases. All levities of speech, and negligences of behaviour, were proscribed. His air was mourn∣ful and contemplative. He laboured to keep alive a sentiment of fear, and a belief of the awe-creating presence of the Deity. Ideas foreign to this were sedulously excluded. To suffer their intrusion was a crime against the Divine Majesty inexpiable but by days and weeks of the keenest agonies.</P>
<P>No material variation had occurred in the lapse of two years. Every day confirmed him in his present modes of thinking and acting. It was to
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
be expected that the tide of his emotions would sometimes recede, that intervals of despondency and doubt would occur; but these gradually were more rare, and of shorter duration; and he, at last, ar∣rived at a state considerably uniform in this respect.</P>
<P>His apprenticeship was now almost expired. On his arrival of age he became entitled, by the will of my grand-father, to a small sum. This sum would hardly suffice to set him afloat as a trader in his present situation, and he had nothing to expect from the generosity of his master. Residence in England had, besides, become almost impossible, on account of his religious tenets. In addition to these motives for seeking a new habitation, there was another of the most imperious and irresistable necessity. He had imbibed an opinion that it was his duty to disseminate the truths of the gospel among the unbelieving nations. He was terrified at first by the perils and hardships to which the life of a missionary is exposed. This cowardice made him diligent in the invention of objections and excuses; but he found it impossible wholly to shake off the belief that such was the injunction of his duty. The belief, after every new conflict with his pas∣sions, acquired new strength; and, at length, he formed a resolution of complying with what he deemed the will of heaven.</P>
<P>The North-American Indians naturally presented themselves as the first objects for this species of be∣nevolence. As soon as his servitude expired, he converted his little fortune into money, and em∣barked for Philadelphia. Here his fears were re∣vived, and a nearer survey of savage manners once more shook his resolution. For a while he relin∣quished his purpose, and purchasing a farm on Schuylkill, within a few miles of the city, set him∣self
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
down to the cultivation of it. The cheapness of land, and the service of African slaves, which were then in general use, gave him who was poor in Europe all the advantages of wealth. He passed fourteen years in a thrifty and laborious manner. In this time new objects, new employments, and new associates appeared to have nearly obliterated the devout impressions of his youth. He now be∣came acquainted with a woman of a meek and quiet disposition, and of slender acquirements like himself. He proffered his hand and was accepted.</P>
<P>His previous industry had now enabled him to dispense with personal labour, and direct attention to his own concerns. He enjoyed leisure, and was visited afresh by devotional contemplation. The reading of the scriptures, and other religious books, became once more his favorite employment. His ancient belief relative to the conversion of the sa∣vage tribes, was revived with uncommon energy. To the former obstacles were now added the plead∣ings of parental and conjugal love. The struggle was long and vehement; but his sense of duty would not be stifled or enfeebled, and finally triumphed over every impediment.</P>
<P>His efforts were attended with no permanent suc∣cess. His exhortations had sometimes a temporary power, but more frequently were repelled with in∣sult and derision. In pursuit of this object he en∣countered the most imminent perils, and underwent incredible fatigues, hunger, sickness, and solitude. The licence of savage passion, and the artifices of his depraved countrymen, all opposed themselves to his progress. His courage did not forsake him till there appeared no reasonable ground to hope for success. He desisted not till his heart was re∣lieved from the supposed obligation to persevere.
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
With a constitution somewhat decayed, he at length returned to his family. An interval of tranquillity succeeded. He was frugal, regular, and strict in the performance of domestic duties. He allied him∣self with no sect, because he perfectly agreed with none. Social worship is that by which they are all distinguished; but this article found no place in his creed. He rigidly interpreted that precept which enjoins us, when we worship, to retire into soli∣tude, and shut out every species of society. Ac∣cording to him devotion was not only a silent office, but must be performed alone. An hour at noon, and an hour at midnight were thus appropriated.</P>
<P>At the distance of three hundred yards from his house, on the top of a rock whose sides were steep, rugged, and encumbered with dwarf cedars and stony asperities, he built what to a common eye would have seemed a summer-house. The eastern verge of this precipice was sixty feet above the ri∣ver which flowed at its foot. The view before it consisted of a transparent current, fluctuating and rippling in a rocky channel, and bounded by a ris∣ing scene of cornfields and orchards. The edifice was slight and airy. It was no more than a circu∣lar area, twelve feet in diameter, whose flooring was the rock, cleared of moss and shrubs, and ex∣actly levelled, edged by twelve Tuscan columns, and covered by an undulating dome. My father furnished the dimensions and outlines, but allowed the artist whom he employed to complete the struc∣ture on his own plan. It was without seat, table, or ornament of any kind.</P>
<P>This was the temple of his Deity. Twice in twenty-four hours he repaired hither, unaccompa∣nied by any human being. Nothing but physical inability to move was allowed to obstruct or post∣pone
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
this visit. He did not exact from his family compliance with his example. Few men, equally sincere in their faith, were as sparing in their cen∣sures and restrictions, with respect to the conduct of others, as my father. The character of my mother was no less devout; but her education had habituated her to a different mode of worship. The loneliness of their dwelling prevented her from joining any established congregation; but she was punctual in the offices of prayer, and in the per∣formance of hymns to her Saviour, after the man∣ner of the disciples of Zinzendorf. My father re∣fused to interfere in her arrangements. His own system was embraced not, accurately speaking, be∣cause it was the best, but because it had been ex∣pressly prescribed to him. Other modes, if prac∣tised by other persons, might be equally acceptable.</P>
<P>His deportment to others was full of charity and mildness. A sadness perpetually overspread his fea∣tures, but was unmingled with sternness or discon∣tent. The tones of his voice, his gestures, his steps were all in tranquil unison. His conduct was cha∣racterised by a certain forbearance and humility, which secured the esteem of those to whom his te∣nets were most obnoxious. They might call him a fanatic and a dreamer, but they could not deny their veneration to his invincible candour and inva∣riable integrity. His own belief of rectitude was the foundation of his happiness. This, however, was destined to find an end.</P>
<P>Suddenly the sadness that constantly attended him was deepened. Sighs, and even tears, sometimes escaped him. To the expostulations of his wife he seldom answered any thing. When he designed to be communicative, he hinted that his peace of mind was flown, in consequence of deviation from
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
his duty. A command had been laid upon him, which he had delayed to perform. He felt as if a certain period of hesitation and reluctance had been allowed him, but that this period was passed. He was no longer permitted to obey. The duty as∣signed to him was transferred, in consequence of his disobedience, to another, and all that remained was to endure the penalty.</P>
<P>He did not describe this penalty. It appeared to be nothing more for some time than a sense of wrong. This was sufficiently acute, and was ag∣gravated by the belief that his offence was incapa∣ble of expiation. No one could contemplate the agonies which he seemed to suffer without the deep∣est compassion. Time, instead of lightening the burthen, appeared to add to it. At length he hinted to his wife, that his end was near. His imagina∣tion did not prefigure the mode or the time of his decease, but was fraught with an incurable per∣suasion that his death was at hand. He was like∣wise haunted by the belief that the kind of death that awaited him was strange and terrible. His anticipations were thus far vague and indefinite; but they sufficed to poison every moment of his be∣ing, and devote him to ceaseless anguish.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY in the morning of a sultry day in Au∣gust, he left Mettingen, to go to the city. He had seldom passed a day from home since his return from the shores of the Ohio. Some urgent en∣gagements at this time existed, which would not admit of further delay. He returned in the even∣ing, but appeared to be greatly oppressed with fa∣tigue. His silence and dejection were likewise in a more than ordinary degree conspicuous. My mother's brother, whose profession was that of a surgeon, chanced to spend this night at our house. It was from him that I have frequently received an exact account of the mournful catastrophe that followed.</P>
<P>As the evening advanced, my father's inquietudes increased. He sat with his family as usual, but took no part in their conversation. He appeared fully engrossed by his own reflections. Occasion∣ally his countenance exhibited tokens of alarm; he gazed stedfastly and wildly at the ceiling; and the exertions of his companions were scarcely suffici∣ent to interrupt his reverie. On recovering from these fits, he expressed no surprize; but pressing his hand to his head, complained, in a tremulous and terrified tone, that his brain was scorched to cinders. He would then betray marks of insupportable anx∣iety.</P>
<P>My uncle perceived, by his pulse, that he was in∣disposed, but in no alarming degree, and ascribed appearances chiefly to the workings of his mind. He exhorted him to recollection and composure, but
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
in vain. At the hour of repose he readily retired to his chamber. At the persuasion of my mother he even undressed and went to bed. Nothing could abate his restlessness. He checked her tender ex∣postulations with some sternness. "Be silent," said he, "for that which I feel there is but one cure, and that will shortly come. You can help me no∣thing. Look to your own condition, and pray to God to strengthen you under the calamities that await you." "What am I to fear?" she answer∣ed. "What terrible disaster is it that you think of?" "Peace—as yet I know it not myself, but come it will, and shortly." She repeated her in∣quiries and doubts; but he suddenly put an end to the discourse, by a stern command to be silent.</P>
<P>She had never before known him in this mood. Hitherto all was benign in his deportment. Her heart was pierced with sorrow at the contemplation of this change. She was utterly unable to account for it, or to figure to herself the species of disaster that was menaced.</P>
<P>Contrary to custom, the lamp, instead of being placed on the hearth, was left upon the table. Over it against the wall there hung a small clock, so con∣trived as to strike a very hard stroke at the end of every sixth hour. That which was now approaching was the signal for retiring to the fane at which he addressed his devotions. Long habit had occasion∣ed him to be always awake at this hour, and the toll was instantly obeyed.</P>
<P>Now frequent and anxious glances were cast at the clock. Not a single movement of the index appeared to escape his notice. As the hour verged towards twelve his anxiety visibly augmented. The trepidations of my mother kept pace with those of her husband; but she was intimidated into silence.
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
All that was left to her was to watch every change of his features, and give vent to her sympathy in tears.</P>
<P>At length the hour was spent, and the clock tol∣led. The sound appeared to communicate a shock to every part of my father's frame. He rose im∣mediately, and threw over himself a loose gown. Even this office was performed with difficulty, for his joints trembled, and his teeth chattered with dis∣may. At this hour his duty called him to the rock, and my mother naturally concluded that it was thi∣ther he intended to repair. Yet these incidents were so uncommon, as to fill her with astonish∣ment and foreboding. She saw him leave the room, and heard his steps as they hastily descended the stairs. She half resolved to rise and pursue him, but the wildness of the scheme quickly suggested itself. He was going to a place whither no power on earth could induce him to suffer an attendant.</P>
<P>The window of her chamber looked toward the rock. The atmosphere was clear and calm, but the edifice could not be discovered at that distance through the dusk. My mother's anxiety would not allow her to remain where she was. She rose, and seated herself at the window. She strained her sight to get a view of the dome, and of the path that led to it. The first painted itself with sufficient distinctness on her fancy, but was undistinguishable by the eye from the rocky mass on which it was erected. The second could be imperfectly seen; but her husband had already passed, or had taken a different direction.</P>
<P>What was it that she feared? Some disaster im∣pended over her husband or herself. He had pre∣dicted evils, but professed himself ignorant of what nature they were. When were they to come?
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Was this night, or this hour to witness the accom∣plishment? She was tortured with impatience, and uncertainty. All her fears were at present linked to his person, and she gazed at the clock, with nearly as much eagerness as my father had done, in ex∣pectation of the next hour.</P>
<P>An half hour passed away in this state of sus∣pence. Her eyes were fixed upon the rock; sud∣denly it was illuminated. A light proceeding from the edifice, made every part of the scene visible. A gleam diffused itself over the intermediate space, and instantly a loud report, like the explosion of a mine, followed. She uttered an involuntary shriek, but the new sounds that greeted her ear, quickly conquered her surprise. They were piercing shrieks, and uttered without intermission. The gleams which had diffused themselves far and wide were in a moment withdrawn, but the interior of the edifice was filled with rays.</P>
<P>The first suggestion was that a pistol was dis∣charged, and that the structure was on fire. She did not allow herself time to meditate a second thought, but rushed into the entry and knocked loudly at the door of her brother's chamber. My uncle had been previously roused by the noise, and instantly flew to the window. He also imagined what he saw to be fire. The loud and vehement shrieks which succeeded the first explosion, seemed to be an invocation of succour. The incident was inexplicable; but he could not fail to perceive the propriety of hastening to the spot. He was un∣bolting the door, when his sister's voice was heard on the outside conjuring him to come forth.</P>
<P>He obeyed the summons with all the speed in his power. He stopped not to question her, but hur∣ried down stairs and across the meadow which lay
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
between the house and the rock. The shrieks were no longer to be heard; but a blazing light was clearly discernible between the columns of the temple. Irregular steps, hewn in the stone, led him to the summit. On three sides, this edifice touched the very verge of the cliff. On the fourth side, which might be regarded as the front, there was an area of small extent, to which the rude staircase con∣ducted you. My uncle speedily gained this spot. His strength was for a moment exhausted by his haste. He paused to rest himself. Meanwhile he bent the most vigilant attention towards the object before him.</P>
<P>Within the columns he beheld what he could no better describe, than by saying that it resembled a cloud impregnated with light. It had the bright∣ness of flame, but was without its upward motion. It did not occupy the whole area, and rose but a few feet above the floor. No part of the building was on fire. This appearance was astonishing. He approached the temple. As he went forward the light retired, and, when he put his feet within the apartment, utterly vanished. The suddenness of this transition increased the darkness that succeeded in a tenfold degree. Fear and wonder rendered him powerless. An occurrence like this, in a place assigned to devotion, was adapted to intimidate the stoutest heart.</P>
<P>His wandering thoughts were recalled by the groans of one near him. His sight gradually re∣covered its power, and he was able to discern my father stretched on the floor. At that moment, my mother and servants arrived with a lanthorn, and enabled my uncle to examine more closely this scene. My father, when he left the house, besides a loose upper vest and slippers, wore a shirt and
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
drawers. Now he was naked, his skin throughout the greater part of his body was scorched and bruised. His right arm exhibited marks as of having been struck by some heavy body. His clothes had been removed, and it was not immediately perceived that they were reduced to ashes. His slippers and his hair were untouched.</P>
<P>He was removed to his chamber, and the requi∣site attention paid to his wounds, which gradually became more painful. A mortification speedily shewed itself in the arm, which had been most hurt. Soon after, the other wounded parts exhi∣bited the like appearance.</P>
<P>Immediately subsequent to this disaster, my father seemed nearly in a state of insensibility. He was passive under every operation. He scarcely opened his eyes, and was with difficulty prevailed upon to answer the questions that were put to him. By his imperfect account, it appeared, that while en∣gaged in silent orisons, with thoughts full of con∣fusion and anxiety, a faint gleam suddenly shot athwart the apartment. His fancy immediately pictured to itself, a person bearing a lamp. It seemed to come from behind. He was in the act of turning to examine the visitant, when his right arm received a blow from a heavy club. At the same instant, a very bright spark was seen to light upon his clothes. In a moment, the whole was reduced to ashes. This was the sum of the infor∣mation which he chose to give. There was some∣what in his manner that indicated an imperfect tale. My uncle was inclined to believe that half the truth had been suppressed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the disease thus wonderfully gene∣rated, betrayed more terrible symptoms. Fever and delirium terminated in lethargic slumber, which,
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
in the course of two hours, gave place to death. Yet not till insupportable exhalations and crawling putrefaction had driven from his chamber and the house every one whom their duty did not detain.</P>
<P>Such was the end of my father. None surely was ever more mysterious. When we recollect his gloomy anticipations and unconquerable anxiety; the security from human malice which his charac∣ter, the place, and the condition of the times, might be supposed to confer; the purity and cloudless∣ness of the atmosphere, which rended it impossible that lightning was the cause; what are the conclu∣sions that we must form?</P>
<P>The prelusive gleam, the blow upon his arm, the fatal spark, the explosion heard so far, the fiery cloud that environed him, without detri∣ment to the structure, though composed of com∣bustible materials, the sudden vanishing of this cloud at my uncle's approach—what is the in∣ference to be drawn from these facts? Their truth cannot be doubted. My uncle's testimony is pe∣culiarly worthy of credit, because no man's temper is more sceptical, and his belief is unalterably at∣tached to natural causes.</P>
<P>I was at this time a child of six years of age. The impressions that were then made upon me, can never be effaced. I was ill qualified to judge respecting what was then passing; but as I advanced in age, and became more fully acquainted with these facts, they oftener became the subject of my thoughts. Their resemblance to recent events re∣vived them with new force in my memory, and made me more anxious to explain them. Was this the penalty of disobedience? this the stroke of a vindictive and invisible hand? Is it a fresh proof that the Divine Ruler interferes in human affairs,
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
meditates an end, selects, and commissions his agents, and enforces, by unequivocal sanctions, submission to his will? Or, was it merely the irre∣gular expansion of the fluid that imparts warmth to our heart and our blood, caused by the fatigue of the preceding day, or flowing, by established laws, from the condition of his thoughts?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A case, in its symptoms exactly parallel to this, is pub∣lished in one of the Journals of Florence.

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE shock which this disastrous occurrence occasioned to my mother, was the foundation of a disease which carried her, in a few months, to the grave. My brother and myself were children at this time, and were now reduced to the condition of orphans. The property which our parents left was by no means inconsiderable. It was entrusted to faithful hands, till we should arrive at a suitable age. Meanwhile, our education was assigned to a maiden aunt who resided in the city, and whose tendern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss made us in a short time cease to regret that we had lost a mother.</P>
<P>The years that succeeded were tranquil and happy. Our lives were molested by few of those cares that are incident to childhood. By accident more than design, the indulgence and yielding tem∣per of our aunt was mingled with resolution and stedfastness. She seldom deviated into either ex∣treme of rigour or lenity. Our social pleasures were subject to no unreasonable restraints. We were instructed in most branches of useful know∣ledge, and were saved from the corruption and tyranny of colleges and boarding-schools.</P>
<P>Our companions were chiefly selected from the children of our neighbours. Between one of these and my brother, there quickly grew the most affec∣tionate intimacy. Her name was Catharine Pleyel. She was rich, beautiful, and contrived to blend the most bewitching softness with the most exuberant vivacity. The tie by which my brother and she were united, seemed to add force to the love which
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
I bore her, and which was amply returned. Be∣tween her and myself there was every circumstance tending to produce and foster friendship. Our sex and age were the same. We lived within sight of each other's abode. Our tempers were remarkably congenial, and the superintendants of our educa∣tion not only prescribed to us the same pursuits, but allowed us to cultivate them together.</P>
<P>Every day added strength to the triple bonds that united us. We gradually withdrew ourselves from the society of others, and found every moment irksome that was not devoted to each other. My brother's advance in age made no change in our situation. It was determined that his profession should be agriculture. His fortune exempted him from the necessity of personal labour. The task to be performed by him was nothing more than super∣intendance. The skill that was demanded by this was merely theoretical, and was furnished by casual inspection, or by closet study. The attention that was paid to this subject did not seclude him for any long time from us, on whom time had no other effect than to augment our impatience in the ab∣sence of each other and of him. Our tasks, our walks, our music, were seldom performed but in each other's company.</P>
<P>It was easy to see that Catharine and my brother were born for each other. The passion which they mutually entertained quickly broke those bounds which extreme youth had set to it; confes∣sions were made or extorted, and their union was postponed only till my brother had passed his mi∣nority. The previous lapse of two years was con∣stantly and usefully employed.</P>
<P>O my brother! But the task I have set myself let me perform with steadiness. The felicity of
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
that period was marred by no gloomy anticipa∣tions. The future, like the present, was serene. Time was supposed to have only new delights in store. I mean not to dwell on previous incidents longer than is necessary to illustrate or explain the great events that have since happened. The nup∣tial day at length arrived. My brother took pos∣session of the house in which he was born, and here the long protracted marriage was solemnized.</P>
<P>My father's property was equally divided be∣tween us. A neat dwelling, situated on the bank of the river, three quarters of a mile from my bro∣ther's, was now occupied by me. These domains were called, from the name of the first possessor, Mettingen. I can scarcely account for my re∣fusing to take up my abode with him, unless it were from a disposition to be an economist of pleasure. Self-denial, seasonably exercised, is one means of enhancing our gratifications. I was, beside, de∣sirous of administering a fund, and regulating an household, of my own. The short distance allowed us to exchange visits as often as we pleased. The walk from one mansion to the other was no unde∣lightful prelude to our interviews. I was some∣times their visitant, and they, as frequently, were my guests.</P>
<P>Our education had been modelled by no reli∣gious standard. We were left to the guidance of our own understanding, and the casual impressions which society might make upon us. My friend's temper, as well as my own, exempted us from much anxiety on this account. It must not be supposed that we were without religion, but with us it was the product of lively feelings, excited by reflection on our own happiness, and by the gran∣deur of external nature. We sought not a basis
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
for our faith, in the weighing of proofs, and the dissection of creeds. Our devotion was a mixed and casual sentiment, seldom verbally expressed, or solicitously sought, or carefully retained. In the midst of present enjoyment, no thought was be∣stowed on the future. As a consolation in calamity religion is dear. But calamity was yet at a dis∣tance, and its only tendency was to heighten enjoyments which needed not this addition to satisfy every craving.</P>
<P>My brother's situation was somewhat different. His deportment was grave, considerate, and thought∣ful. I will not say whether he was indebted to sublimer views for this disposition. Human life, in his opinion, was made up of changeable elements, and the principles of duty were not easily unfolded. The future, either as anterior, or subsequent to death, was a scene that required some preparation and provision to be made for it. These positions we could not deny, but what distinguished him was a propensity to ruminate on these truths. The images that visited us were blithsome and gay, but those with which he was most familiar were of an opposite hue. They did not generate affliction and fear, but they diffused over his behaviour a certain air of forethought and sobriety. The principal effect of this temper was visible in his features and tones. These, in general, bespoke a sort of thril∣ling melancholy. I scarcely ever knew him to laugh. He never accompanied the lawless mirth of his companions with more than a smile, but his conduct was the same as ours.</P>
<P>He partook of our occupations and amusements with a zeal not less than ours, but of a different kind. The diversity in our temper was never the parent of discord, and was scarcely a topic of re∣gret.
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
The scene was variegated, but not tarnished or disordered by it. It hindered the element in which we moved from stagnating. Some agitation and concussion is requisite to the due exercise of human understanding. In his studies, he pursued an austerer and more arduous path. He was much conversant with the history of religious opinions, and took pains to ascertain their validity. He deemed it indispensable to examine the ground of his belief, to settle the relation between motives and actions, the criterion of merit, and the kinds and properties of evidence.</P>
<P>There was an obvious resemblance between him and my father, in their conceptions of the import∣ance of certain topics, and in the light in which the vicissitudes of human life were accustomed to be viewed. Their characters were similar, but the mind of the son was enriched by science, and em∣bellished with literature.</P>
<P>The temple was no longer assigned to its ancient use. From an Italian adventurer, who errone∣ously imagined that he could find employment for his skill, and sale for his sculptures in America, my brother had purchased a bust of Cicero. He professed to have copied this piece from an antique dug up with his own hands in the environs of Mo∣dena. Of the truth of his assertions we were not qualified to judge; but the marble was pure and polished, and we were contented to admire the per∣formance, without waiting for the sanction of con∣noisseurs. We hired the same artist to hew a suitable pedestal from a neighbouring quarry. This was placed in the temple, and the bust rested upon it. Opposite to this was a harpsichord, sheltered by a temporary roof from the weather. This was the place of resort in the evenings of summer. Here
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
we sung, and talked, and read, and occasionally ban∣queted. Every joyous and tender scene most dear to my memory, is connected with this edifice. Here the performances of our musical and poetical ances∣tor were rehearsed. Here my brother's children re∣ceived the rudiments of their education; here a thousand conversations, pregnant with delight and improvement, took place; and here the social affec∣tions were accustomed to expand, and the tear of delicious sympathy to be shed.</P>
<P>My brother was an indefatigable student. The authors whom he read were numerous, but the chief object of his veneration was Cicero. He was never tired of conning and rehearsing his pro∣ductions. To understand them was not sufficient. He was anxious to discover the gestures and ca∣dences with which they ought to be delivered. He was very scrupulous in selecting a true scheme of pronunciation for the Latin tongue, and in adapt∣ing it to the words of his darling writer. His favorite occupation consisted in embellishing his rhetoric with all the proprieties of gesticulation and utterance.</P>
<P>Not contented with this, he was diligent in set∣tling and restoring the purity of the text. For this end, he collected all the editions and commentaries that could be procured, and employed months of severe study in exploring and comparing them. He never betrayed more satisfaction than when he made a discovery of this kind.</P>
<P>It was not till the addition of Henry Pleyel, my friend's only brother, to our society, that his passion for Roman eloquence was countenanced and fos∣tered by a sympathy of tastes. This young man had been some years in Europe. We had sepa∣rated
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
at a very early age, and he was now returned to spend the remainder of his days among us.</P>
<P>Our circle was greatly enlivened by the accession of a new member. His conversation abounded with novelty. His gaiety was almost boisterous, but was capable of yielding to a grave deportment, when the occasion required it. His discernment was acute, but he was prone to view every object merely as supplying materials for mirth. His con∣ceptions were ardent but ludicrous, and his me∣mory, aided, as he honestly acknowledged, by his invention, was an inexhaustible fund of entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>His residence was at the same distance below the city as ours was above, but there seldom passed a day without our being favoured with a visit. My brother and he were endowed with the same attach∣ment to the Latin writers; and Pleyel was not be∣hind his friend in his knowledge of the history and metaphysics of religion. Their creeds, however, were in many respects opposite. Where one dis∣covered only confirmations of his faith, the other could find nothing but reasons for doubt. Moral necessity, and calvinistic inspiration, were the props on which my brother thought proper to repose. Pleyel was the champion of intellectual liberty, and rejected all guidance but that of his reason. Their discussions were frequent, but, being ma∣naged with candour as well as with skill, they were always listened to by us with avidity and be∣nefit.</P>
<P>Pleyel, like his new friends, was fond of music and poetry. Henceforth our concerts consisted of two violins, an harpsichord, and three voices. We were frequently reminded how much hap∣piness
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
depends upon society. This new friend, though, before his arrival, we were sensible of no vacuity, could not now be spared. His departure would occasion a void which nothing could fill, and which would produce insupportable regret. Even my brother, though his opinions were hourly assailed, and even the divinity of Cicero contested, was captivated with his friend, and laid aside some part of his ancient gravity at Pleyel's ap∣proach.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>SIX years of uninterrupted happiness had rolled away, since my brother's marriage. The sound of war had been heard, but it was at such a dis∣tance as to enhance our enjoyment by affording objects of comparison. The Indians were repuls∣ed on the one side, and Canada was conquered on the other. Revolutions and battles, however ca∣lamitous to those who occupied the scene, contri∣buted in some sort to our happiness, by agitating our minds with curiosity, and furnishing causes of patriotic exultation. Four children, three of whom were of an age to compensate, by their personal and mental progress, the cares of which they had been, at a more helpless age, the objects, exercised my brother's tenderness. The fourth was a charm∣ing babe that promised to display the image of her mother, and enjoyed perfect health. To these were added a sweet girl fourteen years old, who was loved by all of us, with an affection more than parental.</P>
<P>Her mother's story was a mournful one. She had come hither from England when this child was an infant, alone, without friends, and without money. She appeared to have embarked in a hasty and clandestine manner. She passed three years of solitude and anguish under my aunt's protection, and died a martyr to woe; the source of which she could, by no importunities, be prevailed upon to unfold. Her education and manners bespoke her to be of no mean birth. Her last moments were rendered serene▪ by the assurances she received from
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
my aunt, that her daughter should experience the same protection that had been extended to herself.</P>
<P>On my brother's marriage, it was agreed that she should make a part of his family. I cannot do justice to the attractions of this girl. Perhaps the tenderness she excited might partly originate in her personal resemblance to her mother, whose character and misfortunes were still fresh in our remembrance. She was habitually pensive, and this circumstance tended to remind the spectator of her friendless condition; and yet that epithet was surely misapplied in this case. This being was cherished by those with whom she now resided, with unspeakable fondness. Every exertion was made to enlarge and improve her mind. Her safety was the object of a solicitude that almost exceeded the bounds of discretion. Our affection indeed could scarcely transcend her merits. She never met my eye, or occurred to my reflections, without ex∣citing a kind of enthusiasm. Her softness, her in∣telligence, her equanimity, never shall I see sur∣passed. I have often shed tears of pleasure at her approach, and pressed her to my bosom in an agony of fondness.</P>
<P>While every day was adding to the charms of her person, and the stores of her mind, there occurred an event which threatened to deprive us of her. An officer of some rank, who had been disabled by a wound at Quebec, had employed himself, since the ratification of peace, in travelling through the colo∣nies. He remained a considerable period at Phila∣delphia, but was at last preparing for his departure. No one had been more frequently honoured with his visits than Mrs. Baynton, a worthy lady with whom our family were intimate. He went to her house with a view to perform a farewell visit, and was on
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
the point of taking his leave, when I and my young friend entered the apartment. It is impossible to describe the emotions of the stranger, when he fixed his eyes upon my companion. He was motion∣less with surprise. He was unable to conceal his feelings, but sat silently gazing at the spectacle be∣fore him. At length he turned to Mrs. Baynton, and more by his looks and gestures than by words, besought her for an explanation of the scene. He seized the hand of the girl, who, in her turn, was surprised by his behaviour, and drawing her for∣ward, said in an eager and faultering tone, Who is she? whence does she come? what is her name?</P>
<P>The answers that were given only increased the confusion of his thoughts. He was successively told, that she was the daughter of one whose name was Louisa Conway, who arrived among us at such a time, who seduously concealed her parentage, and the motives of her flight, whose incurable griefs had finally destroyed her, and who had left this child under the protection of her friends. Having heard the tale, he melted into tears, eagerly clasped the young lady in his arms, and called himself her father. When the tumults excited in his breast by this unlooked for meeting were somewhat subsided, he gratified our curiosity by relating the following incidents.</P>
<P>"Miss Conway was the only daughter of a banker in London, who discharged towards her every duty of an affectionate father. He had chanced to fall into her company, had been subdued by her attractions, had tendered her his hand, and been joyfully accepted both by parent and child. His wife had given him every proof of the fondest at∣tachment. Her father, who possessed immense wealth, treated him with distinguished respect, libe∣rally
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
supplied his wants, and had made one condi∣tion of his consent to their union, a resolution to take up their abode with him.</P>
<P>"They had passed three years of conjugal felicity, which had been augmented by the birth of this child; when his professional duty called him into Germany. It was not without an arduous struggle, that she was persuaded to relinquish the design of accompanying him through all the toils and perils of war. No parting was ever more distressful. They strove to alleviate, by frequent letters, the evils of their lot. Those of his wise, breathed nothing but anxiety for his safety, and impatience of his ab∣sence. At length, a new arrangement was made, and he was obliged to repair from Westphalia to Canada. One advantage attended this change. It afforded him an opportunity of meeting his family. His wife anticipated this interview, with no less rapture than himself. He hurried to London, and the moment he alighted from the stage-coach, ran with all speed to Mr. Conway's house.</P>
<P>"It was an house of mourning. His father was overwhelmed with grief, and incapable of answer∣ing his inquiries. The servants, sorrowful and mute, were equally refractory. He explored the house, and called on the names of his wife and daughter, but his summons was fruitless. At length, this new disaster was explained. Two days before his arrival, his wife's chamber was found empty. No search, however diligent and anxious, could trace her steps. No cause could be assigned for her disappearance. The mother and child had fled away together.</P>
<P>"New exertions were made, her chamber and cabinets were ransacked, but no vestige was found serving to inform them as to the motives of her
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
flight, whether it had been voluntary or otherwise, and in what corner of the kingdom or of the world she was concealed. Who shall describe the sorrow and amazement of the husband? His restlessness, his vicissitudes of hope and fear, and his ultimate despair? His duty called him to America. He had been in this city, and had frequently passed the door of the house in which his wife, at that moment, resided. Her father had not remitted his exertions to eluci∣date this painful mystery, but they had failed. This disappointment hastened his death; in conse∣quence of which, Louisa's father became possessor of his immense property."</P>
<P>This tale was a copious theme of speculation. A thousand questions were started and discussed in our domestic circle, respecting the motives that influenced Mrs. Stuart to abandon her country. It did not appear that her proceeding was involun∣tary. We recalled and reviewed every particular that had fallen under our own observation. By none of these were we furnished with a clue. Her conduct, after the most rigorous scrutiny, still re∣mained an impenetrable secret. On a nearer view, Major Stuart proved himself a man of most amiable character. His attachment to Louisa ap∣peared hourly to increase. She was no stranger to the sentiments suitable to her new character. She could not but readily embrace the scheme which was proposed to her, to return with her father to England. This scheme his regard for her in∣duced him, however, to postpone. Some time was necessary to prepare her for so great a change and enable her to think without agony of her separa∣tion from us.</P>
<P>I was not without hopes of prevailing on her father entirely to relinquish this unwelcome design.
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
Meanwhile, he pursued his travels through the southern colonies, and his daughter continued with us. Louisa and my brother frequently received letters from him, which indicated a mind of no common order. They were filled with amusing details, and profound reflections. While here, he often partook of our evening conversations at the temple; and since his departure, his correspond∣ence had frequently supplied us with topics of dis∣course.</P>
<P>One afternoon in May, the blandness of the air, and brightness of the verdure, induced us to assem∣ble, earlier than usual, in the temple. We females were busy at the needle, while my brother and Pleyel were bandying quotations and syllogisms. The point discussed was the merit of the oration for Cluentius, as descriptive, first, of the genius of the speaker; and, secondly, of the manners of the times. Pleyel laboured to extenuate both these species of merit, and tasked his ingenuity, to shew that the orator had embraced a bad cause; or, at least, a doubtful one. He urged, that to rely on the exaggerations of an advocate, or to make the picture of a single family a model from which to sketch the condition of a nation, was absurd. The controversy was suddenly diverted into a new chan∣nel, by a misquotation. Pleyel accused his com∣panion of saying <HI>"polliciatur"</HI> when he should have said <HI>"pollicerctur"</HI> Nothing would decide the contest, but an appeal to the volume. My brother was returning to the house for this purpose, when a servant met him with a letter from Major Stuart. He immediately returned to read it in our company.</P>
<P>Besides affectionate compliments to us, and pa∣ternal benedictions on Louisa, his letter contained
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
a description of a waterfall on the Monongahela. A sudden gust of rain falling, we were compelled to remove to the house. The storm passed away, and a radiant moon-light succeeded. There was no motion to resume our seats in the temple. We therefore remained where we were, and engaged in sprightly conversation. The letter lately received naturally suggested the topic. A parallel was drawn between the cataract there described, and one which Pleyel had discovered among the Alps of Glarus. In the state of the former, some par∣ticular was mentioned, the truth of which was questionable. To settle the dispute which thence arose, it was proposed to have recourse to the letter. My brother searched for it in his pocket. It was no where to be found. At length, he remembered to have left it in the temple, and he determined to go in search of it. His wife, Pleyel, Louisa, and myself, remained where we were.</P>
<P>In a few minutes he returned. I was somewhat interested in the dispute, and was therefore impa∣tient for his return; yet, as I heard him ascending the stairs, I could not but remark, that he had exe∣cuted his intention with remarkable dispatch. My eyes were fixed upon him on his entrance. Me∣thought he brought with him looks considerably different from those with which he departed. Won∣der, and a slight portion of anxiety were mingled in them. His eyes seemed to be in search of some object. They passed quickly from one person to another, till they rested on his wife. She was seated in a careless attitude on the sofa, in the same spot as before. She had the same muslin in her hand, by which her attention was chiefly en∣grossed.</P>
<P>The moment he saw her, his perplexity visibly
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
increased. He quietly seated himself, and fixing his eyes on the floor, appeared to be absorbed in meditation. These singularities suspended the in∣quiry which I was preparing to make respecting the letter. In a short time, the company relin∣quished the subject which engaged them, and di∣rected their attention to Wieland. They thought that he only waited for a pause in the discourse, to produce the letter. The pause was uninterrupted by him. At length Pleyel said, "Well, I suppose you have found the letter."</P>
<P>"No," said he, without any abatement of his gravity, and looking stedfastly at his wife, "I did not mount the hill."—"Why not?"—"Catha∣rine, have you not moved from that spot since I left the room?"—She was affected with the solem∣nity of his manner, and laying down her work, an∣swered in a tone of surprise, "No; Why do you ask that question?"—His eyes were again fixed upon the floor, and he did not immediately answer. At length, he said, looking round upon us, "Is it true that Catharine did not follow me to the hill? That she did not just now enter the room?"—We assur∣ed him, with one voice, that she had not been absent for a moment, and inquired into the motive of his questions.</P>
<P>"Your assurances," said he, "are solemn and unanimous; and yet I must deny credit to your assertions, or disbelieve the testimony of my senses, which informed me, when I was half way up the hill, that Catharine was at the bottom."</P>
<P>We were confounded at this declaration. Pleyel rallied him with great levity on his behaviour. He listened to his friend with calmness, but without any relaxation of features.</P>
<P>"One thing," said he with emphasis, "is true;
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
either I heard my wife's voice at the bottom of the hill, or I do not hear your voice at present."</P>
<P>"Truly," returned Pleyel, "it is a sad dilemma to which you have reduced yourself. Certain it is, if our eyes can give us certainty, that your wife has been sitting in that spot during every moment of your absence. You have heard her voice, you say, upon the hill. In general, her voice, like her tem∣per, is all softness. To be heard across the room, she is obliged to exert herself. While you were gone, if I mistake not, she did not utter a word. Clara and I had all the talk to ourselves. Still it may be that she held a whispering conference with you on the hill; but tell us the particulars."</P>
<P>"The conference," said he, "was short; and far from being carried on in a whisper. You know with what intention I left the house. Half way to the rock, the moon was for a moment hidden from us by a cloud. I never knew the air to be more bland and more calm. In this interval I glanced at the temple, and thought I saw a glimmering be∣tween the columns. It was so faint, that it would not perhaps have been visible, if the moon had not been shrowded. I looked again, but saw nothing. I never visit this building alone, or at night, without being reminded of the fate of my father. There was nothing wonderful in this appearance; yet it suggested something more than mere solitude and darkness in the same place would have done.</P>
<P>"I kept on my way. The images that haunted me were solemn; and I entertained an imperfect curiosity, but no fear, as to the nature of this ob∣ject. I had ascended the hill little more than half way, when a voice called me from behind. The accents were clear, distinct, powerful, and were uttered, as I fully believed, by my wife. Her voice
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not commonly so loud. She has seldom occasion to exert it, but, nevertheless, I have sometimes heard her call with force and eagerness. If my ear was not deceived, it was her voice which I heard.</P>
<P>"Stop, go no further. There is danger in your path." The suddenness and unexpectedness of this warning, the tone of alarm with which it was given, and, above all, the persuasion that it was my wife who spoke, were enough to disconcert and make me pause. I turned and listened to assure myself that I was not mistaken. The deepest silence succeeded. At length, I spoke in my turn. Who calls? is it you, Catharine? I stopped and presently received an answer. "Yes, it is I; go not up; return instantly; you are wanted at the house." Still the voice was Catharine's, and still it proceeded from the foot of the stairs.</P>
<P>"What could I do? The warning was myste∣rious. To be uttered by Catharine at a place, and on an occasion like these, enhanced the mystery. I could do nothing but obey. Accordingly, I trod back my steps, expecting that she waited for me at the bottom of the hill. When I reached the bottom, no one was visible. The moon-light was once more universal and brilliant, and yet, as far as I could see no human or moving figure was discern∣able. If she had returned to the house, she must have used wonderous expedition to have passed already beyond the reach of my eye. I exerted my voice, but in vain. To my repeated exclamations, no answer was returned.</P>
<P>"Ruminating on these incidents, I returned hither. There was no room to doubt that I had heard my wife's voice; attending incidents were not easily ex∣plained; but you now assure me that nothing ex∣traordinary
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
has happened to urge my return, and that my wife has not moved from her seat."</P>
<P>Such was my brother's narrative. It was heard by us with different emotions. Pleyel did not scru∣ple to regard the whole as a deception of the senses. Perhaps a voice had been heard; but Wieland's ima∣gination had misled him in supposing a resemblance to that of his wife, and giving such a signification to the sounds. According to his custom he spoke what he thought. Sometimes, he made it the theme of grave discussion, but more frequently treated it with ridicule. He did not believe that sober reason∣ing would convince his friend, and gaiety, he thought, was useful to take away the solemnities which, in a mind like Wieland's, an accident of this kind was calculated to produce.</P>
<P>Pleyel proposed to go in search of the letter. He went and speedily returned, bearing it in his hand. He had found it open on the pedestal; and neither voice nor visage had risen to impede his design.</P>
<P>Catharine was endowed with an uncommon portion of good sense; but her mind was accessible, on this quarter, to wonder and panic. That her voice should be thus inexplicably and unwar∣rantably assumed, was a source of no small disquie∣tude. She admitted the plausibility of the argu∣ments by which Pleyel endeavoured to prove, that this was no more than an auricular deception; but this conviction was sure to be shaken, when she turned her eyes upon her husband, and perceived that Pleyel's logic was far from having produced the same effect upon him.</P>
<P>As to myself, my attention was engaged by this occurrence. I could not fail to perceive a shadowy resemblance between it and my father's

death. On the latter event, I had frequently re∣flected; my reflections never conducted me to certainty, but the doubts that existed were not of a tormenting kind. I could not deny that the event was miraculous, and yet I was invincibly averse to that method of solution. My wonder was excited by the inscrutableness of the cause, but my wonder was unmixed with sorrow or fear. It begat in me a thrilling, and not unpleasing solem∣nity. Similar to these were the sensations produced by the recent adventure.</P>
<P>But its effect upon my brother's imagination was of chief moment. All that was desirable was, that it should be regarded by him with indifference. The worst effect that could flow, was not indeed very formidable. Yet I could not bear to think that his senses should be the victims of such delu∣sion. It argued a diseased condition of his frame, which might show itself hereafter in more danger∣ous symptoms. The will is the tool of the under∣standing, which must fashion its conclusions on the notices of sense. If the senses be depraved, it is impossible to calculate the evils that may flow from the consequent deductions of the understanding.</P>
<P>I said, this man is of an ardent and melancholy character. Those ideas which, in others, are casual or obscure, which are entertained in moments of abstraction and solitude, and easily escape when the scene is changed, have obtained an immoveable hold upon his mind. The conclusions which long habit has rendered familiar, and, in some sort, pal∣pable to his intellect, are drawn from the deepest sources. All his actions and practical sentiments are linked with long and abstruse deductions from the system of divine government and the laws of
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
our intellectual constitution. He is, in some re∣spects, an enthusiast, but is fortified in his belief by innumerable arguments and subtilties.</P>
<P>His father's death was always regarded by him as flowing from a direct and supernatural decree. It visited his meditations oftener than it did mine. The traces which it left were more gloomy and permanent. This new incident had a visible effect in augmenting his gravity. He was less disposed than formerly to converse and reading. When we sifted his thoughts, they were generally found to have a relation, more or less direct, with this incident. It was difficult to ascertain the exact species of im∣pression which it made upon him. He never in∣troduced the subject into conversation, and listened with a silent and half-serious smile to the satirical effusions of Pleyel.</P>
<P>One evening we chanced to be alone together in the temple. I seized that opportunity of inves∣tigating the state of his thoughts. After a pause, which he seemed in no wise inclined to interrupt, I spoke to him—"How almost palpable is this dark; yet a ray from above would dispel it." "Ay," said Wieland, with fervor, "not only the physical, but moral night would be dispelled." "But why," said I, "must the Divine Will address its precepts to the eye?" He smiled significantly. "True," said he, "the understanding has other avenues." "You have never," said I, approaching nearer to the point—"you have never told me in what way you considered the late extraordinary incident." "There is no determinate way in which the sub∣ject can be viewed. Here is an effect, but the cause is utterly inscrutable. To suppose a decep∣tion will not do. Such is possible, but there are
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
twenty other suppositions more probable. They must all be set aside before we reach that point." "What are these twenty supposi∣tions" "It is needless to mention them. They are only less improbable than Pleyel's. Time may convert one of them into certainty. Till then it is useless to expatiate on them."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time had elapsed when there happened another occurrence, still more remarkable. Pleyel, on his return from Europe, brought information of considerable importance to my brother. My an∣cestors were noble Saxons, and possessed large do∣mains in Lufatia. The Prussian wars had destroyed those persons whose right to these estates pre∣cluded my brother's. Pleyel had been exact in his inquiries, and had discovered that, by the law of male-primogeniture, my brother's claims were superior to those of any other person now liv∣ing. Nothing was wanting but his presence in that country, and a legal application to establish this claim.</P>
<P>Pleyel strenuously recommended this measure. The advantages he thought attending it were nu∣merous, and it would argue the utmost folly to neglect them. Contrary to his expectation he found my brother averse to the scheme. Slight ef∣forts, he, at first, thought would subdue his reluc∣tance; but he sound this aversion by no means flight. The interest that he took in the happiness of his friend and his sister, and his own partiality to the Saxon soil, from which he had likewise sprung, and where he had spent several years of his youth, made him redouble his exertions to win Wieland's consent. For this end he employed every argument that his invention could suggest. He paint∣ed, in attractive colours, the state of manners and government in that country, the security of civil rights, and the freedom of religious sentiments. He
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
dwelt on the privileges of wealth and rank, and drew from the servile condition of one class, an argument in favor of his scheme, since the revenue and power annexed to a German principality af∣ford so large a field for benevolence. The evil flowing from this power, in malignant hands, was proportioned to the good that would arise from the virtuous use of it. Hence, Wieland, in forbearing to claim his own, withheld all the positive felicity that would accrue to his vassals from his success, and hazarded all the misery that would redound from a less enlightened proprietor.</P>
<P>It was easy for my brother to repel these argu∣ments, and to shew that no spot on the globe en∣joyed equal security and liberty to that which he at present inhabited. That if the Saxons had no∣thing to fear from mis-government, the external causes of havoc and alarm were numerous and manifest. The recent devastations committed by the Prussians furnished a specimen of these. The horrors of war would always impend over them, till Germany were seized and divided by Austrian and Prussian tyrants; an event which he strongly suspected was at no great distance. But setting these considerations aside, was it laudable to grasp at wealth and power even when they were within our reach? Were not these the two great sources of depravity? What security had he, that in this change of place and condition, he should not de∣generate into a tyrant and voluptuary? Power and riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of their tendency to deprave the possessor. He held them in abhorrence, not only as instruments of misery to others, but to him on whom they were conferred. Besides, riches were comparative, and was he not rich already? He lived at present in the
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
bosom of security and luxury. All the instruments of pleasure, on which his reason or imagination set any value, were within his reach. But these he must forego, for the sake of advantages which, whatever were their value, were as yet uncertain. In pursuit of an imaginary addition to his wealth, he must reduce himself to poverty, he must exchange present certainties for what was distant and con∣tingent; for who knows not that the law is a system of expence, delay and uncertainty? If he should embrace this scheme, it would lay him under the necessity of making a voyage to Europe, and re∣maining for a certain period, separate from his family. He must undergo the perils and discom∣forts of the ocean; he must divest himself of all domestic pleasures; he must deprive his wife of her companion, and his children of a father and instruct∣or, and all for what? For the ambiguous advanta∣ges which overgrown wealth and flagitious tyranny have to bestow? For a precarious possession in a land of turbulence and war? Advantages, which will not certainly be gained, and of which the acquisi∣tion, if it were sure, is necessarily distant.</P>
<P>Pleyel was enamoured of his scheme on account of its intrinsic benefits, but, likewise, for other rea∣sons. His abode at Leipsig made that country appear to him like home. He was connected with this place by many social ties. While there he had not escaped the amorous contagion. But the lady, though her heart was impressed in his favor, was compelled to bestow her hand upon another. Death had removed this impediment, and he was now in∣vited by the lady herself to return. This he was of course determined to do, but was anxious to ob∣tain the company of Wieland; he could not bear to think of an eternal separation from his present
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
associates. Their interest, he thought, would be no less promoted by the change than his own. Hence he was importunate and indefatigable in his argu∣ments and solicitations.</P>
<P>He knew that he could not hope for mine or his sister's ready concurrence in this scheme. Should the subject be mentioned to us, we should league our efforts against him, and strengthen that reluc∣tance in Wieland which already was sufficiently difficult to conquer. He, therefore, anxiously con∣cealed from us his purpose. If Wieland were previously enlisted in his cause, he would find it a less difficult task to overcome our aversion. My brother was silent on this subject, because he be∣lieved himself in no danger of changing his opinion, and he was willing to save us from any uneasiness. The mere mention of such a scheme, and the pos∣sibility of his embracing it, he knew, would consi∣derably impair our tranquillity.</P>
<P>One day, about three weeks subsequent to the mysterious call, it was agreed that the family should be my guests. Seldom had a day been passed by us, of more serene enjoyment. Pleyel had promis∣ed us his company, but we did not see him till the sun had nearly declined. He brought with him a countenance that betokened disappointment and vexation. He did not wait for our inquiries, but immediately explained the cause. Two days be∣fore a packet had arrived from Hamburgh, by which he had flattered himself with the expectation of receiving letters, but no letters had arrived. I never saw him so much subdued by an untoward event. His thoughts were employed in accounting for the silence of his friends. He was seized with the tor∣ments of jealousy, and suspected nothing less than the infidelity of her to whom he had devoted his
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
heart. The silence must have been concerted. Her sickness, or absence, or death, would have in∣creased the certainty of some one's having written. No supposition could be formed but that his mis∣tress had grown indifferent, or that she had trans∣ferred her affections to another. The miscarriage of a letter was hardly within the reach of possibility. From Leipsig to Hamburgh, and from Hamburgh hither, the conveyance was exposed to no hazard.</P>
<P>He had been so long detained in America chiefly in consequence of Wieland's aversion to the scheme which he proposed. He now became more impa∣tient than ever to return to Europe. When he reflected that, by his delays, he had probably for∣feited the affections of his mistress, his sensations amounted to agony. It only remained, by his speedy departure, to repair, if possible, or prevent so intolerable an evil. Already he had half resolved to embark in this very ship which, he was inform∣ed, would set out in a few weeks on her return.</P>
<P>Meanwhile he determined to make a new at∣tempt to shake the resolution of Wieland. The evening was somewhat advanced when he invited the latter to walk abroad with him. The invitation was accepted, and they left Catharine, Louisa and me, to amuse ourselves by the best means in our power. During this walk, Pleyel renewed the subject that was nearest his heart. He re-urged all his former arguments, and placed them in more forcible lights.</P>
<P>They promised to return shortly; but hour after hour passed, and they made not their appearance. Engaged in sprightly conversation, it was not till the clock struck twelve that we were reminded of the lapse of time. The absence of our friends ex∣cited some uneasy apprehensions. We were ex∣pressing
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
our fears, and comparing our conjectures as to what might be the cause, when they entered together. There were indications in their coun∣tenances that struck me mute. These were un∣noticed by Catharine, who was eager to express her surprize and curiosity at the length of their walk. As they listened to her, I remarked that their surprize was not less than ours. They gazed in silence on each other, and on her. I watched their looks, but could not understand the emotions that were written in them.</P>
<P>These appearances diverted Catharine's inquiries into a new channel. What did they mean, she asked, by their silence, and by their thus gazing wildly at each other, and at her? Pleyel profited by this hint, and assuming an air of indifference, framed some trifling excuse, at the same time darting signi∣ficant glances at Wieland, as if to caution him against disclosing the truth. My brother said no∣thing, but delivered himself up to meditation. I likewise was silent, but burned with impatience to fathom this mystery. Presently my brother and his wife, and Louisa, returned home. Pleyel pro∣posed, of his own accord, to be my guest for the night. This circumstance, in addition to those which preceded, gave new edge to my wonder.</P>
<P>As soon as we were left alone, Pleyel's counte∣nance assumed an air of seriousness, and even con∣sternation, which I had never before beheld in him. The steps with which he measured the floor betoken∣ed the trouble of his thoughts. My inquiries were suspended by the hope that he would give me the information that I wanted without the importunity of questions. I waited some time, but the confu∣sion of his thoughts appeared in no degree to abate. At length I mentioned the apprehensions which
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
their unusual absence had occasioned, and which were increased by their behaviour since their return, and solicited an explanation. He stopped when I began to speak, and looked stedfastly at me. When I had done, he said, to me, in a tone which faulter∣ed through the vehemence of his emotions, "How were you employed during our absence?" "In turning over the Della Crusca dictionary, and talk∣ing on different subjects; but just before your en∣trance, we were tormenting ourselves with omens and prognosticks relative to your absence." "Ca∣tharine was with you the whole time?" "Yes," "But are you sure?" "Most sure. She was not absent a moment." He stood, for a time, as if to assure himself of my sincerity. Then, clenching his hands, and wildly lifting them above his head, "Lo," cried he, "I have news to tell you. The Baroness de Stolberg is dead?"</P>
<P>This was her whom he loved. I was not sur∣prised at the agitations which he betrayed. "But how was the information procured? How was the truth of this news connected with the circum∣stance of Catharine's remaining in our company?" He was for some time inattentive to my questions. When he spoke, it seemed merely a continuation of the reverie into which he had been plunged.</P>
<P>"And yet it might be a mere deception. But could both of us in that case have been deceived? A rare and prodigious coincidence! Barely not impossible. And yet, if the accent be oracular— Theresa is dead. No, no," continued he, co∣vering his face with his hands, and in a tone half broken into sobs, "I cannot believe it. She has not written, but if she were dead, the faithful Ber∣trand would have given me the earliest information. And yet if he knew his master, he must have easily
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
guessed at the effect of such tidings. In pity to me he was silent."</P>
<P>"Clara, forgive me; to you, this behaviour is mysterious. I will explain as well as I am able. But say not a word to Catharine. Her strength of mind is inferior to your's. She will, besides, have more reason to be startled. She is Wieland's an∣gel."</P>
<P>Pleyel proceeded to inform me, for the first time, of the scheme which he had pressed, with so much earnestness, on my brother. He enumerated the objections which had been made, and the industry with which he had endeavoured to confute them. He mentioned the effect upon his resolutions pro∣duced by the failure of a letter. "During our late walk," continued he, "I introduced the subject that was nearest my heart. I re-urged all my former arguments, and placed them in more forcible lights. Wieland was still refractory. He expatiated on the perils of wealth and power, on the sacredness of conjugal and parental duties, and the happiness of mediocrity.</P>
<P>"No wonder that the time passed, unperceived, away. Our whole souls were engaged in this cause. Several times we came to the foot of the rock; as soon as we perceived it, we changed our course, but never failed to terminate our circuitous and devious ramble at this spot. At length your brother observed, "We seem to be led hither by a kind of fatality. Since we are so near, let us ascend and rest ourselves a while. If you are not weary of this argument we will resume it there."</P>
<P>"I tacitly consented. We mounted the stairs, and drawing the sofa in front of the river, we seated ourselves upon it. I took up the thread of
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
our discourse where we had dropped it. I ridiculed his dread of the sea, and his attachment to home. I kept on in this strain, so congenial with my dispo∣sition, for some time, uninterrupted by him. At length, he said to me, "Suppose now that I, whom argument has not convinced, should yield to ridi∣cule, and should agree that your scheme is eligible; what will you have gained? Nothing. You have other enemies beside myself to encounter. When you have vanquished me, your toil has scarcely begun. There are my sister and wife, with whom it will remain for you to maintain the contest. And trust me, they are adversaries whom all your force and stratagem will never subdue." I insinuated that they would model themselves by his will: that Catharine would think obedience her duty. He answered, with some quickness, "You mistake. Their concurrence is indispen∣sable. It is not my custom to exact sacrifices of this kind. I live to be their protector and friend, and not their tyrant and foe. If my wife shall deem her happiness, and that of her children, most consulted by remaining where she is, here she shall remain." "But," said I, "when she knows your pleasure, will she not conform to it?" Before my friend had time to answer this question, a ne∣gative was clearly and distinctly uttered from ano∣ther quarter. It did not come from one side or the other, from before us or behind. Whence then did it come? By whose organs was it fashioned?</P>
<P>"If any uncertainty had existed with regard to these particulars, it would have been removed by a deliberate and equally distinct repetition of the same monosyllable, "No." The voice was my sister's. It appeared to come from the roof. I started from my seat. Catharine, exclaimed I, where are you?
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
No answer was returned. I searched the room, and the area before it, but in vain. Your bro∣ther was motionless in his seat. I returned to him, and placed-myself again by his side. My astonish∣ment was not less than his."</P>
<P>"Well," said he, at length, "What think you of this? This is the self-same voice which I for∣merly heard; you are now convinced that my ears were well informed."</P>
<P>"Yes," said I, "this, it is plain, is no fiction of the fancy." We again sunk into mutual and thoughtful silence. A recollection of the hour, and of the length of our absence, made me at last propose to return. We rose up for this purpose. In doing this, my mind reverted to the contempla∣tion of my own condition. "Yes," said I aloud, but without particularly addressing myself to Wie∣land, "my resolution is taken, I cannot hope to prevail with my friends to accompany me. They may doze away their days on the banks of Schuyl∣kill, but as to me, I go in the next vessel; I will fly to her presence, and demand the reason of this extraordinary silence."</P>
<P>"I had scarcely finished the sentence, when the same mysterious voice exclaimed, "You shall not go. The seal of death is on her lips. Her silence is the silence of the tomb." Think of the effects which accents like these must have had upon me. I shuddered as I listened. As soon as I recovered from my first amazement, "Who is it that speaks?" said I, "whence did you procure these dismal tid∣ings?" I did not wait long for an answer. "From a source that cannot fail. Be satisfied. She is dead." You may justly be surprised, that, in the circum∣stances in which I heard the tidings, and notwith∣standing the mystery which environed him by
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
whom they were imparted, I could give an undi∣vided attention to the facts, which were the subject of our dialogue. I eagerly inquired, when and where did she die? What was the cause of her death? Was her death absolutely certain? An answer was returned only to the last of these ques∣tions. "Yes," was pronounced by the same voice; but it now sounded from a greater distance, and the deepest silence was all the return made to my subsequent interrogatories.</P>
<P>"It was my sister's voice; but it could not be uttered by her; and yet, if not by her, by whom was it uttered? When we returned hither, and discovered you together, the doubt that had previ∣ously existed was removed. It was manifest that the intimation came not from her. Yet if not from her, from whom could it come? Are the circumstances attending the imparting of this news proof that the tidings are true? God forbid that they should be true."</P>
<P>Here Pleyel sunk into anxious silence, and gave me leisure to ruminate on this inexplicable event. I am at a loss to describe the sensations that affected me. I am not fearful of shadows. The tales of apparitions and enchantments did not possess that power over my belief which could even render them interesting. I saw nothing in them but igno∣rance and folly, and was a stranger even to that terror which is pleasing. But this incident was different from any that I had ever before known. Here were proofs of a sensible and intelligent existence, which could not be denied. Here was information obtained and imparted by means un∣questionably super-human.</P>
<P>That there are conscious beings, beside ourselves, in existence, whose modes of activity and infor∣mation
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
surpass our own, can scarcely be denied. Is there a glimpse afforded us into a world of these superior beings? My heart was scarcely large enough to give admittance to so swelling a thought. An awe, the sweetest and most solemn that imagi∣nation can conceive, pervaded my whole frame. It forsook me not when I parted from Pleyel and retired to my chamber. An impulse was given to my spirits utterly incompatible with sleep. I passed the night wakeful and full of meditation. I was impressed with the belief of mysterious, but not of malignant agency. Hitherto nothing had occurred to persuade me that this airy minister was busy to evil rather than to good purposes. On the con∣trary, the idea of superior virtue had always been associated in my mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with that of superior power. The warnings that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thus been heard appeared to have been prompted by beneficent intentions. My brother had been hindered by this voice from ascending the hill. He was told that danger lurked in his path, and his obedience to the intimation had perhaps saved him from a destiny similar to that of my father.</P>
<P>Pleyel had been rescued from tormenting uncer∣tainty, and from the hazards and fatigues of a fruitless voyage, by the same interposition. It had assured him of the death of his Theresa.</P>
<P>This woman was then dead. A confirmation of the tidings, if true, would speedily arrive. Was this confirmation to be deprecated or desired? By her death, the tie that attached him to Europe, was taken away. Henceforward every motive would combine to retain him in his native country, and we were rescued from the deep regrets that would accompany his hopeless absence from us. Propi∣tious was the spirit that imparted these tidings.
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
Propitious he would perhaps have been, if he had been instrumental in producing, as well as in com∣municating the tidings of her death. Propitious to us, the friends of Pleyel, to whom has thereby been secured the enjoyment of his society; and not unpro∣pitious to himself; for though this object of his love be snatched away, is there not another who is able and willing to console him for her loss?</P>
<P>Twenty days after this, another vessel arrived from the same port. In this interval, Pleyel, for the most part, estranged himself from his old com∣panions. He was become the prey of a gloomy and unsociable grief. His walks were limited to the bank of the Delaware. This bank is an artificial one. Reeds and the river are on one side, and a watery marsh on the other, in that part which bounded his lands, and which extended from the mouth of Hollander's creek to that of Schuyl∣kill. No scene can be imagined less enticing to a lover of the picturesque than this. The shore is deformed with mud, and incumbered with a forest of reeds. The fields, in most seasons, are mire; but when they afford a firm footing, the ditches by which they are bounded and intersected, are mantled with stagnating green, and emit the most noxious exhalations. Health is no less a stranger to those seats than pleasure. Spring and autumn are sure to be accompanied with agues and bilious remittents.</P>
<P>The scenes which environed our dwellings at Mettingen constituted the reverse of this. Schuyl∣kill was here a pure and translucid current, broken into wild and ceaseless music by rocky points, mur∣muring on a sandy margin, and reflecting on its surface, banks of all varieties of height and degrees of declivity. These banks were chequered by
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
patches of dark verdure and shapeless masses of white marble, and crowned by copses of cedar, or by the regular magnificence of orchards, which, at this season, were in blossom, and were prodigal of odours. The ground which receded from the river was scooped into valleys and dales. Its beau∣ties were enhanced by the horticultural skill of my brother, who bedecked this exquisite assemblage of slopes and risings with every species of vegetable ornament, from the giant arms of the oak to the clustering tendrils of the honey-suckle.</P>
<P>To screen him from the unwholesome airs of his own residence, it had been proposed to Pleyel to spend the months of spring with us. He had apparently acquiesced in this proposal; but the late event induced him to change his purpose. He was only to be seen by visiting him in his retirements. His gaiety had flown, and every passion was absorb∣ed in eagerness to procure tidings from Saxony. I have mentioned the arrival of another vessel from the Elbe. He descried her early one morning as he was passing along the skirt of the river. She was easily recognized, being the ship in which he had performed his first voyage to Germany. He immediately went on board, but found no letters directed to him. This omission was, in some de∣gree, compensated by meeting with an old acquaint∣ance among the passengers, who had till lately been a resident in Leipsig. This person put an end to all suspense respecting the fate of Theresa, by re∣lating the particulars of her death and funeral.</P>
<P>Thus was the truth of the former intimation attested. No longer devoured by suspense, the grief of Pleyel was not long in yielding to the in∣fluence of society. He gave himself up once more to our company. His vivacity had indeed been
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
damped; but even in this respect he was a more acceptable companion than formerly, since his seri∣ousness was neither incommunicative nor sullen.</P>
<P>These incidents, for a time, occupied all our thoughts. In me they produced a sentiment not unallied to pleasure, and more speedily than in the case of my friends were intermixed with other to∣pics. My brother was particularly affected by them. It was easy to perceive that most of his meditations were tinctured from this source. To this was to be ascribed a design in which his pen was, at this period, engaged, of collecting and investigating the facts which relate to that mysterious personage, the Daemon of Socrates.</P>
<P>My brother's skill in Greek and Roman learn∣ing was exceeded by that of few, and no doubt the world would have accepted a treatise upon this subject from his hand with avidity; but alas! this and every other scheme of felicity and honor, were doomed to sudden blast and hopeless extermi∣nation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW come to the mention of a person with whose name the most turbulent sensations are con∣nected. It is with a shuddering reluctance that I enter on the province of describing him. Now it is that I begin to perceive the difficulty of the task which I have undertaken; but it would be weakness to shrink from it. My blood is congealed: and my fingers are palsied when I call up his image. Shame upon my cowardly and infirm heart! Hi∣therto I have proceeded with some degree of com∣posure, but now I must pause. I mean not that dire remembrance shall subdue my courage or baffle my design, but this weakness cannot be immedi∣ately conquered. I must desist for a little while.</P>
<P>I have taken a few turns in my chamber, and have gathered strength enough to proceed. Yet have I not projected a task beyond my power to execute? If thus, on the very threshold of the scene, my knees faulter and I sink, how shall I sup∣port myself, when I rush into the midst of horrors such as no heart has hitherto conceived, nor tongue related? I sicken and recoil at the prospect, and yet my irresolution is momentary. I have not formed this design upon slight grounds, and though I may at times pause and hesitate, I will not be finally diverted from it.</P>
<P>And thou, O most fatal and potent of mankind, in what terms shall I describe thee? What words are adequate to the just delineation of thy charac∣ter? How shall I detail the means which rendered
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
the secrecy of thy purposes unfathomable? But I will not anticipate. Let me recover if possible, a sober strain. Let me keep down the flood of passion that would render me precipitate or power∣less. Let me stifle the agonies that are awakened by thy name. Let me, for a time, regard thee as a being of no terrible attributes. Let me tear myself from contemplation of the evils of which it is but too certain that thou wast the author, and limit my view to those harmless appearances which attended thy entrance on the stage.</P>
<P>One sunny afternoon, I was standing in the door of my house, when I marked a person passing close to the edge of the bank that was in front. His pace was a careless and lingering one, and had none of that gracefulness and ease which distin∣guish a person with certain advantages of edu∣cation from a clown. His gait was rustic and aukward. His form was ungainly and dispropor∣tioned. Shoulders broad and square, breast sunken, his head drooping, his body of uniform breadth, supported by long and lank legs, were the ingre∣dients of his frame. His garb was not ill adapted to such a figure. A slouched hat, tarnished by the weather, a coat of thick grey cloth, cut and wrought, as it seemed, by a country tailor, blue worsted stockings, and shoes fastened by thongs, and deeply discoloured by dust, which brush had never disturbed, constituted his dress.</P>
<P>There was nothing remarkable in these appear∣ances; they were frequently to be met with on the road, and in the harverst field. I cannot tell why I gazed upon them, on this occasion, with more than ordinary attention, unless it were that such figures were seldom seen by me, except on the road or field. This lawn was only traversed by men
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
whose views were directed to the pleasures of the walk, or the grandeur of the scenery.</P>
<P>He passed slowly along, frequently pausing, as if to examine the prospect more deliberately, but never turning his eye towards the house, so as to allow me a view of his countenance. Presently, he entered a copse at a small distance, and disap∣peared. My eye followed him while he remained in sight. If his image remained for any duration in my fancy after his departure, it was because no other object occurred sufficient to expel it.</P>
<P>I continued in the same spot for half an hour, vaguely, and by fits, contemplating the image of this wanderer, and drawing, from outward appearances, those inferences with respect to the intellectual history of this person, which experience affords us. I reflected on the alliance which commonly subsists between ignorance and the practice of agriculture, and indulged myself in airy speculations as to the influence of progressive knowledge in dissolving this alliance, and embodying the dreams of the poets. I asked why the plough and the hoe might not become the trade of every human being, and how this trade might be made conducive to, or, at least, consistent with the acquisition of wisdom and eloquence.</P>
<P>Weary with these reflections, I returned to the kitchen to perform some household office. I had usually but one servant, and she was a girl about my own age. I was busy near the chimney, and she was employed near the door of the apartment, when some one knocked. The door was opened by her, and she was immediately addressed with "Pry'thee, good girl, canst thou supply a thirsty man with a glass of buttermilk?" She answered that there was none in the house. "Aye, but
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
there is some in the dairy yonder. Thou knowest as well as I, though Hermes never taught thee, that though every dairy be an house, every house is not a dairy." To this speech, though she understood only a part of it, she replied by repeating her assur∣ances, that she had none to give. "Well then," rejoined the stranger, "for charity's sweet sake, hand me forth a cup of cold water." The girl said she would go to the spring and fetch it. "Nay, give me the cup, and suffer me to help myself. Neither manacled nor lame, I should merit burial in the maw of carrion crows, if I laid this task upon thee." She gave him the cup, and he turned to go to the spring.</P>
<P>I listened to this dialogue in silence. The words uttered by the person without, affected me as some∣what singular, but what chiefly rendered them re∣markable, was the tone that accompanied them. It was wholly new. My brother's voice and Pleyel's were musical and energetic. I had fondly ima∣gined, that, in this respect, they were surpassed by none. Now my mistake was detected. I cannot pretend to communicate the impression that was made upon me by these accents, or to depict the degree in which force and sweetness were blended in them. They were articulated with a distinct∣ness that was unexampled in my experience. But this was not all. The voice was not only melli∣fluent and clear, but the emphasis was so just, and the modulation so impassioned, that it seemed as if an heart of stone could not fail of being moved by it. It imparted to me an emotion altogether in∣voluntary and incontroulable. When he uttered the words "for charity's sweet sake," I dropped the cloth that I held in my hand, my heart overflowed with sympathy, and my eyes with unbidden tears.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63"/>This description will appear to you trifling or incredible. The importance of these circumstances will be manifested in the sequel. The manner in which I was affected on this occasion, was, to my own apprehension, a subject of astonishment. The tones were indeed such as I never heard be∣fore; but that they should, in an instant, as it were, dissolve me in tears, will not easily be be∣lieved by others, and can scarcely be comprehend∣ed by myself.</P>
<P>It will be readily supposed that I was somewhat inquisitive as to the person and demeanour of our visitant. After a moment's pause, I stepped to the door and looked after him. Judge my surprize, when I beheld the self-same figure that had appeared an half hour before upon the bank. My fancy had conjured up a very different image. A form, and attitude, and garb, were instantly created wor∣thy to accompany such elocution; but this person was, in all visible respects, the reverse of this phan∣tom. Strange as it may seem, I could not speedily reconcile myself to this disappointment. Instead of returning to my employment, I threw myself in a chair that was placed opposite the door, and sunk into a fit of musing.</P>
<P>My attention was, in a few minutes, recalled by the stranger, who returned with the empty cup in his hand. I had not thought of the circum∣stance, or should certainly have chosen a different seat. He no sooner shewed himself, than a con∣fused sense of impropriety, added to the suddenness of the interview, for which, not having foreseen it, I had made no preparation, threw me into a state of the most painful embarrassment. He brought with him a placid brow; but no sooner had he cast his eyes upon me, than his face was as glowingly
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
suffused as my own. He placed the cup upon the bench, stammered out thanks, and retired.</P>
<P>It was some time before I could recover my wonted composure. I had snatched a view of the stranger's countenance. The impression that it made was vivid and indelible. His cheeks were pallid and lank, his eyes sunken, his forehead overshadowed by coarse straggling hairs, his teeth large and irre∣gular, though sound and brilliantly white, and his chin discoloured by a tetter. His skin was of coarse grain, and sallow hue. Every feature was wide of beauty, and the outline of his face re∣minded you of an inverted cone.</P>
<P>And yet his forehead, so far as shaggy locks would allow it to be seen, his eyes lustrously black, and possessing, in the midst of haggardness, a radi∣ance inexpressibly serene and potent, and something in the rest of his features, which it would be in vain to describe, but which served to betoken a mind of the highest order, were essential ingredients in the portrait. This, in the effects which imme∣diately flowed from it, I count among the most ex∣traordinary incidents of my life. This face, seen for a moment, continued for hours to occupy my fancy, to the exclusion of almost every other image. I had purposed to spend the evening with my bro∣ther, but I could not resist the inclination of forming a sketch upon paper of this memorable visage. Whether my hand was aided by any peculiar in∣spiration, or I was deceived by my own fond con∣ceptions, this portrait, though hastily executed, ap∣peared unexceptionable to my own taste.</P>
<P>I placed it at all distances, and in all lights; my eyes were rivetted upon it. Half the night passed away in wakefulness and in contemplation of this picture. So flexible, and yet so stubborn, is the
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
human mind. So obedient to impulses the most transient and brief, and yet so unalterably observant of the direction which is given to it! How little did I then foresee the termination of that chain, of which this may be regarded as the first link?</P>
<P>Next day arose in darkness and storm. Tor∣rents of rain fell during the whole day, attended with incessant thunder, which reverberated in stun∣ning echoes from the opposite declivity. The in∣clemency of the air would not allow me to walk out. I had, indeed, no inclination to leave my apartment. I betook myself to the contempla∣tion of this portrait, whose attractions time had rather enhanced than diminished. I laid aside my usual occupations, and seating myself at a window, consumed the day in alternately looking out upon the storm, and gazing at the picture which lay upon a table before me. You will, perhaps, deem this conduct somewhat singular, and ascribe it to certain peculiarities of temper. I am not aware of any such peculiarities. I can account for my devotion to this image no otherwise, than by sup∣posing that its properties were rare and prodigious. Perhaps you will suspect that such were the first in∣roads of a passion incident to every female heart, and which frequently gains a footing by means even more slight, and more improbable than these. I shall not controvert the reasonableness of the sus∣picion, but leave you at liberty to draw, from my narrative, what conclusions you please.</P>
<P>Night at length returned, and the storm ceased. The air was once more clear and calm, and bore an affecting contrast to that uproar of the elements by which it had been preceded. I spent the dark∣some hours, as I spent the day, contemplative and seated at the window. Why was my mind ab∣sorbed
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
in thoughts ominous and dreary? Why did my bosom heave with sighs, and my eyes overflow with tears? Was the tempest that had just past a signal of the ruin which impended over me? My soul fondly dwelt upon the images of my brother and his children, yet they only increased the mournfulness of my contemplations. The smiles of the charming babes were as bland as formerly. The same dignity sat on the brow of their father, and yet I thought of them with an∣guish. Something whispered that the happiness we at present enjoyed was set on mutable founda∣tions. Death must happen to all. Whether our felicity was to be subverted by it to-morrow, or whether it was ordained that we should lay down our heads full of years and of honor, was a question that no human being could solve. At other times, these ideas seldom intruded. I either forbore to re∣flect upon the destiny that is reserved for all men, or the reflection was mixed up with images that disrobed it of terror; but now the uncertainty of life occurred to me without any of its usual and alle∣viating accompaniments. I said to myself, we must die. Sooner or later, we must disappear for ever from the face of the earth. Whatever be the links that hold us to life, they must be broken. This scene of existence is, in all its parts, calamitous. The greater number is oppressed with immediate evils, and those, the tide of whose fortunes is full, how small is their portion of enjoyment, since they know that it will terminate.</P>
<P>For some time I indulged myself, without re∣luctance, in these gloomy thoughts; but at length, the dejection which they produced became insup∣portably painful. I endeavoured to dissipate it with music. I had all my grand-father's melody as well
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
as poetry by rote. I now lighted by chance on a ballad, which commemorated the fate of a German Cavalier, who fell at the siege of Nice under God∣frey of Bouillon. My choice was unfortunate, for the scenes of violence and carnage which were here wildly but forcibly pourtrayed, only suggested to my thoughts a new topic in the horrors of war.</P>
<P>I sought refuge, but ineffectually, in sleep. My mind was thronged by vivid, but confused images, and no effort that I made was sufficient to drive them away. In this situation I heard the clock, which hung in the room, give the signal for twelve. It was the same instrument which formerly hung in my father's chamber, and which, on account of its being his workmanship, was regarded, by every one of our family, with veneration. It had fallen to me, in the division of his property, and was placed in this asylum. The sound awakened a series of reflections, respecting his death. I was not allowed to pursue them; for scarcely had the vibrations ceased, when my attention was attracted by a whisper, which, at first, appeared to proceed from lips that were laid close to my ear.</P>
<P>No wonder that a circumstance like this startled me. In the first impulse of my terror, I uttered a slight scream, and shrunk to the opposite side of the bed. In a moment, however. I recovered from my trepidation. I was habitually indifferent to all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of fear, by which the majority are afflicted. I entertained no apprehension of either ghosts or robbers. Our security had never been molested by either, and I made use of no means to prevent or counterwork their machinations. My tranquillity, on this occasion, was quickly retrieved. The whisper evidently proceeded from one who was posted at my bed-side. The first idea that suggested
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
itself was, that it was uttered by the girl who lived with me as a servant. Perhaps, somewhat had alarmed her, or she was sick, and had come to re∣quest my assistance. By whispering in my ear, she intended to rouse without alarming me.</P>
<P>Full of this persuasion, I called; "Judith," said I, "is it you? What do you want? Is there any thing the matter with you?" No answer was returned. I repeated my inquiry, but equally in vain. Cloudy as was the atmosphere, and cur∣tained as my bed was, nothing was visible. I withdrew the curtain, and leaning my head on my elbow, I listened with the deepest attention to catch some new sound. Meanwhile, I ran over in my thoughts, every circumstance that could assist my conjectures.</P>
<P>My habitation was a wooden edifice, consisting of two stories. In each story were two rooms, separated by an entry, or middle passage, with which they communicated by opposite doors. The passage, on the lower story, had doors at the two ends, and a stair-case. Windows answered to the doors on the upper story. Annexed to this, on the eastern side, were wings, divided, in like manner, into an upper and lower room; one of them com∣prized a kitchen, and chamber above it for the ser∣vant, and communicated, on both stories, with the parlour adjoining it below, and the chamber ad∣joining it above. The opposite wing is of smaller dimensions, the rooms not being above eight feet square. The lower of these was used as a depo∣sitory of household implements, the upper was a closet in which I deposited my books and papers. They had but one inlet, which was from the room adjoining. There was no window in the lower one, and in the upper, a small aperture which com∣municated
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
light and air, but would scarcely admit the body. The door which led into this, was close to my bed-head, and was always locked, but when I myself was within. The avenues below were accustomed to be closed and bolted at nights.</P>
<P>The maid was my only companion, and she could not reach my chamber without previously passing through the opposite chamber, and the mid∣dle passage, of which, however, the doors were usually unfastened. If she had occasioned this noise, she would have answered my repeated calls. No other conclusion, therefore, was left me, but that I had mistaken the sounds, and that my ima∣gination had transformed some casual noise into the voice of a human creature. Satisfied with this solution, I was preparing to relinquish my listening attitude, when my ear was again saluted with a new and yet louder whispering. It appeared, as be∣fore, to issue from lips that touched my pillow. A second effort of attention, however, clearly shewed me, that the sounds issued from within the closet, the door of which was not more than eight inches from my pillow.</P>
<P>This second interruption occasioned a shock less vehement than the former. I started, but gave no audible token of alarm. I was so much mistress of my feelings, as to continue listening to what should be said. The whisper was distinct, hoarse, and uttered so as to shew that the speaker was de∣sirous of being heard by some one near, but, at the same time, studious to avoid being overheard by any other.</P>
<P>"Stop, stop, I say; madman as you are! there are better means than that. Curse upon your rashness! There is no need to shoot."</P>
<P>Such were the words uttered in a tone of eager∣ness
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
and anger, within so small a distance of my pillow. What construction could I put upon them? My heart began to palpitate with dread of some unknown danger. Presently, another voice, but equally near me, was heard whispering in an∣swer. "Why not? I will draw a trigger in this business, but perdition be my lot if I do more." To this, the first voice returned, in a tone which rage had heightened in a small degree above a whisper, "Coward! stand aside, and see me do it. I will grasp her throat; I will do her business in an instant; she shall not have time so much as to groan." What wonder that I was petrified by sounds so dreadful! Murderers lurked in my closet. They were planning the means of my de∣struction. One resolved to shoot, and the other menaced suffocation. Their means being chosen, they would forthwith break the door. Flight in∣stantly suggested itself as most eligible in circum∣stances so perilous. I deliberated not a moment; but, fear adding wings to my speed, I leaped out of bed, and scantily robed as I was, rushed out of the chamber, down stairs, and into the open air. I can hardly recollect the process of turning keys, and withdrawing bolts. My terrors urged me forward with almost a mechanical impulse. I stopped not till I reached my brother's door. I had not gained the threshold, when, exhausted by the violence of my emotions, and by my speed, I sunk down in a fit.</P>
<P>How long I remained in this situation I know not. When I recovered, I found myself stretched on a bed, surrounded by my sister and her female servants. I was astonished at the scene before me, but gradually recovered the recollection of what had happened. I answered their importunate in∣quiries
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
as well as I was able. My brother and Pleyel, whom the storm of the preceding day chanced to detain here, informing themselves of every particular, proceeded with lights and weapons to my deserted habitation. They entered my cham∣ber and my closet, and found every thing in its pro∣per place and customary order. The door of the closet was locked, and appeared not to have been opened in my absence. They went to Judith's apartment. They found her asleep and in safety. Pleyel's caution induced him to forbear alarming the girl; and finding her wholly ignorant of what had passed, they directed her to return to her cham∣ber. They then fastened the doors, and returned.</P>
<P>My friends were disposed to regard this transac∣tion as a dream. That persons should be actually immured in this closet, to which, in the circum∣stances of the time, access from without or within was apparently impossible, they could not seriously believe. That any human beings had intended murder, unless it were to cover a scheme of pillage, was incredible; but that no such design had been formed, was evident from the security in which the furniture of the house and the closet remained.</P>
<P>I revolved every incident and expression that had occurred. My senses assured me of the truth of them, and yet their abruptness and improbability made me, in my turn, somewhat incredulous. The adventure had made a deep impression on my fancy, and it was not till after a week's abode at my bro∣ther's, that I resolved to resume the possession of my own dwelling.</P>
<P>There was another circumstance that enhanced the mysteriousness of this event. After my recovery it was obvious to inquire by what means the atten∣tion of the family had been drawn to my situation.
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
I had fallen before I had reached the threshold, or was able to give any signal. My brother related, that while this was transacting in my chamber, he himself was awake, in consequence of some slight indisposition, and lay, according to his custom, musing on some favorite topic. Suddenly the silence, which was remarkably profound, was bro∣ken by a voice of most piercing shrillness, that seemed to be uttered by one in the hall below his chamber. "Awake! arise!" it exclaimed: "has∣ten to succour one that is dying at your door."</P>
<P>This summons was effectual. There was no one in the house who was not roused by it. Pleyel was the first to obey, and my brother overtook him before he reached the hall. What was the general astonishment when your friend was discovered stretched upon the grass before the door, pale, ghastly, and with every mark of death!</P>
<P>This was the third instance of a voice, exerted for the benefit of this little community. The agent was no less inscrutable in this, than in the former case. When I ruminated upon these events, my soul was suspended in wonder and awe. Was I really deceived in imagining that I heard the closet conversation? I was no longer at liberty to ques∣tion the reality of those accents which had formerly recalled my brother from the hill; which had im∣parted tidings of the death of the German lady to Pleyel; and which had lately summoned them to my assistance.</P>
<P>But how was I to regard this midnight conversa∣tion? Hoarse and manlike voices conferring on the means of death, so near my bed, and at such an hour! How had my ancient security vanished! That dwelling, which had hitherto been an invio∣late asylum, was now beset with danger to my life.
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
That solitude, formerly so dear to me, could no longer be endured. Pleyel, who had consented to reside with us during the months of spring, lodged in the vacant chamber, in order to quiet my alarms. He treated my fears with ridicule, and in a short time very slight traces of them remained: but as it was wholly indifferent to him whether his nights were passed at my house or at my brother's, this arrangement gave general satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL not enumerate the various inquiries and conjectures which these incidents occasioned. After all our efforts, we came no nearer to dispelling the mist in which they were involved; and time, instead of facilitating a solution, only accumulated our doubts.</P>
<P>In the midst of thoughts excited by these events, I was not unmindful of my interview with the stranger. I related the particulars, and shewed the portrait to my friends. Pleyel recollected to have met with a figure resembling my description in the city; but neither his face or garb made the same im∣pression upon him that it made upon me. It was a hint to rally me upon my prepossessions, and to amuse us with a thousand ludicrous anecdotes which he had collected in his travels. He made no scruple to charge me with being in love; and threatened to inform the swain, when he met him, of his good fortune.</P>
<P>Pleyel's temper made him susceptible of no dur∣able impressions. His conversation was occasion∣ally visited by gleams of his ancient vivacity; but, though his impetuosity was sometimes inconvenient, there was nothing to dread from his malice. I had no fear that my character or dignity would suffer in his hands, and was not heartily displeased when he declared his intention of profiting by his first meeting with the stranger to introduce him to our acquaintance.</P>
<P>Some weeks after this I had spent a toilsome day, and, as the sun declined, found myself disposed to
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
seek relief in a walk. The river bank is, at this part of it, and for some considerable space upward, so rugged and steep as not to be easily descended. In a recess of this declivity, near the southern verge of my little demesne, was placed a slight building, with seats and lattices. From a crevice of the rock, to which this edifice was attached, there burst sorth a stream of the purest water, which, leaping from ledge to ledge, for the space of sixty feet, produced a freshness in the air, and a murmur, the most delicious and soothing imaginable. These, added to the odours of the cedars which embowered it, and of the honey-suckle which clustered among the lattices, rendered this my favorite retreat in summer.</P>
<P>On this occasion I repaired hither. My spirits drooped through the fatigue of long attention, and I threw myself upon a bench, in a state, both mentally and personally, of the utmost supineness. The lulling sounds of the waterfall, the fragrance and the dusk combined to becalm my spirits, and, in a short time, to sink me into sleep. Either the uneasiness of my posture, or some slight indispo∣sition molested my repose with dreams of no cheer∣ful hue. After various incoherences had taken their turn to occupy my fancy, I at length ima∣gined myself walking, in the evening twilight, to my brother's habitation. A pit, methought, had been dug in the path I had taken, of which I was not aware. As I carelessly pursued my walk, I thought I saw my brother, standing at some dis∣tance before me, beckoning and calling me to make haste. He stood on the opposite edge of the gulph. I mended my pace, and one step more would have plunged me into this abyss, had not some one from behind caught suddenly my arm, and exclaimed, in a voice of eagerness and terror, "Hold! hold!"</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76"/>The sound broke my sleep, and I found myself, at the next moment, standing on my feet, and sur∣rounded by the deepest darkness. Images so terrific and forcible disabled me, for a time, from distin∣guishing between sleep and wakefulness, and with∣held from me the knowledge of my actual condi∣tion. My first panics were succeeded by the per∣turbations of surprize, to find myself alone in the open air, and immersed in so deep a gloom. I slowly recollected the incidents of the afternoon, and how I came hither. I could not estimate the time, but saw the propriety of returning with speed to the house. My faculties were still too confused, and the darkness too intense, to allow me imme∣diately to find my way up the steep. I sat down, therefore, to recover myself, and to reflect upon my situation.</P>
<P>This was no sooner done, than a low voice was heard from behind the lattice, on the side where I sat. Between the rock and the lattice was a chasm not wide enough to admit a human body; yet, in this chasm he that spoke appeared to be stationed. "Attend! attend! but be not terrified."</P>
<P>I started and exclaimed, "Good heavens! what is that? Who are you?"</P>
<P>"A friend; one come, not to injure, but to save you; fear nothing."</P>
<P>This voice was immediately recognized to be the same with one of those which I had heard in the closet; it was the voice of him who had proposed to shoot, rather than to strangle, his victim. My terror made me, at once, mute and motionless. He continued, "I leagued to murder you. I repent. Mark my bidding, and be safe. Avoid this spot. The snares of death encompass it. Elsewhere danger will be distant; but this spot, shun it as you
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
value your life. Mark me further; profit by this warning, but divulge it not. If a syllable of what has passed escape you, your doom is sealed. Re∣member your father, and be faithful."</P>
<P>Here the accents ceased, and left me overwhelmed with dismay. I was fraught with the persuasion, that during every moment I remained here, my life was endangered; but I could not take a step without hazard of falling to the bottom of the pre∣cipice. The path, leading to the summit, was short, but rugged and intricate. Even star-light was excluded by the umbrage, and not the faintest gleam was afforded to guide my steps. What should I do? To depart or remain was equally and eminently perilous.</P>
<P>In this state of uncertainty, I perceived a ray flit across the gloom and disappear. Another succeed∣ed, which was stronger, and remained for a passing moment. It glittered on the shrubs that were scat∣tered at the entrance, and gleam continued to suc∣ceed gleam for a few seconds, till they, finally, gave place to unintermitted darkness.</P>
<P>The first visitings of this light called up a train of horrors in my mind; destruction impended over this spot; the voice which I had lately heard had warned me to retire, and had menaced me with the fate of my father if I refused. I was desirous, but unable, to obey; these gleams were such as pre∣luded the stroke by which he fell; the hour, per∣haps, was the same—I shuddered as if I had be∣held, suspended over me, the exterminating sword.</P>
<P>Presently a new and stronger illumination burst through the lattice on the right hand, and a voice, from the edge of the precipice above, called out my name. It was Pleyel. Joyfully did I recognize his accents; but such was the tumult of my thoughts
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
that I had not power to answer him till he had fre∣quently repeated his summons. I hurried, at length, from the fatal spot, and, directed by the lanthorn which he bore, ascended the hill.</P>
<P>Pale and breathless, it was with difficulty I could support myself. He anxiously inquired into the cause of my affright, and the motive of my unu∣sual absence. He had returned from my brother's at a late hour, and was informed by Judith, that I had walked out before sun-set, and had not yet re∣turned. This intelligence was somewhat alarming. He waited some time; but, my absence continuing, he had set out in search of me. He had explored the neighbourhood with the utmost care, but, re∣ceiving no tidings of me, he was preparing to ac∣quaint my brother with this circumstance, when he recollected the summer-house on the bank, and con∣ceived it possible that some accident had detained me there. He again inquired into the cause of this detention, and of that confusion and dismay which my looks testified.</P>
<P>I told him that I had strolled hither in the after∣noon, that sleep had overtaken me as I sat, and that I had awakened a few minutes before his arrival▪ I could tell him no more. In the present impe∣tuosity of my thoughts, I was almost dubious, whe∣ther the pit, into which my brother had endeavoured to entice me, and the voice that talked through the lattice, were not parts of the same dream. I re∣membered, likewise, the charge of secrecy, and the penalty denounced, if I should rashly divulge what I had heard. For these reasons, I was silent on that subject, and shutting myself in my chamber, delivered myself up to contemplation.</P>
<P>What I have related will, no doubt, appear to you a fable. You will believe that calamity has
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
subverted my reason, and that I am amusing you with the chimeras of my brain, instead of facts that have really happened. I shall not be surprized or offended, if these be your suspicions. I know not, indeed, how you can deny them admission. For, if to me, the immediate witness, they were fertile of perplexity and doubt, how must they affect another to whom they are recommended only by my testi∣mony? It was only by subsequent events, that I was fully and incontestibly assured of the veracity of my senses.</P>
<P>Meanwhile what was I to think? I had been assured that a design had been formed against my life. The ruffians had leagued to murder me. Whom had I offended? Who was there with whom I had ever maintained intercourse, who was capable of harbouring such atrocious purposes?</P>
<P>My temper was the reverse of cruel and impe∣rious. My heart was touched with sympathy for the children of misfortune. But this sympathy was not a barren sentiment. My purse, scanty as it was, was ever open, and my hands ever active, to relieve distress. Many were the wretches whom my personal exertions had extricated from want and disease, and who rewarded me with their gratitude. There was no face which lowered at my approach, and no lips which uttered imprecations in my hear∣ing. On the contrary, there was none, over whose fate I had exerted any influence, or to whom I was known by reputation, who did not greet me with smiles, and dismiss me with proofs of venera∣tion; yet did not my senses assure me that a plot was laid against my life?</P>
<P>I am not destitute of courage, I have shewn myself deliberative and calm in the midst of peril. I have hazarded my own life, for the preservation
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
of another, but now was I confused and panic struck. I have not lived so as to fear death, yet to perish by an unseen and secret stroke, to be mangled by the knife of an assassin, was a thought at which I shuddered; what had I done to deserve to be made the victim of malignant passions?</P>
<P>But soft! was I not assured, that my life was safe in all places but one? And why was the trea∣son limited to take effect in this spot? I was every where equally defenceless. My house and cham∣ber were, at all times, accessible. Danger still im∣pended over me; the bloody purpose was still en∣tertained, but the hand that was to execute it, was powerless in all places but one!</P>
<P>Here I had remained for the last four or five hours, without the means of resistance or defence, yet I had not been attacked. A human being was at hand, who was conscious of my presence, and warned me hereafter to avoid this retreat. His voice was not absolutely new, but had I never heard it but once before? But why did he pro∣hibit me from relating this incident to others, and what species of death will be awarded if I disobey?</P>
<P>He talked of my father. He intimated, that dis∣closure would pull upon my head, the same de∣struction. Was then the death of my father, por∣tentous and inexplicable as it was, the consequence of human machinations? It should seem, that this being is apprised of the true nature of this event, and is conscious of the means that led to it. Whe∣ther it shall likewise fall upon me, depends upon the observance of silence. Was it the infraction of a similar command, that brought so horrible a penalty upon my father?</P>
<P>Such were the reflections that haunted me dur∣ing the night, and which effectually deprived me of
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
sleep. Next morning, at breakfast, Pleyel related an event which my disappearance had hindered him from mentioning the night before. Early the pre∣ceding morning, his occasions called him to the city; he had stepped into a coffee-house to while away an hour; here he had met a person whose appearance instantly bespoke him to be the same whose hasty visit I have mentioned, and whose extraordinary visage and tones had so powerfully affected me. On an attentive survey, however, he proved, likewise, to be one with whom my friend had had some intercourse in Europe. This authorised the liberty of accosting him, and after some conversation, mindful, as Pleyel said, of the footing which this stranger had gained in my heart, he had ventured to invite him to Mettingen. The invitation had been cheerfully accepted, and a visit promised on the afternoon of the next day.</P>
<P>This information excited no sober emotions in my breast. I was, of course, eager to be informed as to the circumstances of their ancient intercourse. When, and where had they met? What knew he of the life and character of this man?</P>
<P>In answer to my inquiries, he informed me that, three years before, he was a traveller in Spain. He had made an excursion from Valencia to Murvie∣dro, with a view to inspect the remains of Roman magnificence, scattered in the environs of that town. While traversing the scite of the theatre of old Saguntum, he lighted upon this man, seated on a stone, and deeply engaged in perusing the work of the deacon Marti. A short conversation ensued, which proved the stranger to be English. They returned to Valencia together.</P>
<P>His garb, aspect, and deportment, were wholly Spanish. A residence of three years in the coun∣try,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
indefatigable attention to the language, and a studious conformity with the customs of the people, had made him indistinguishable from a native, when he chose to assume that character. Pleyel found him to he connected, on the footing of friendship and respect, with many eminent merchants in that city. He had embraced the catholic religion, and adopted a Spanish name instead of his own, which was CARWIN, and devoted himself to the literature and religion of his new country. He pursued no pro∣fession, but subsisted on remittances from England.</P>
<P>While Pleyel remained in Valencia, Carwin be∣trayed no aversion to intercourse, and the former found no small attractions in the society of this new acquaintance. On general topics he was highly intelligent and communicative. He had visited every corner of Spain, and could furnish the most accu∣rate details respecting its ancient and present state. On topics of religion and of his own history, pre∣vious to his <HI>transformation</HI> into a Spaniard, he was invariably silent. You could merely gather from his discourse that he was English, and that he was well acquainted with the neighbouring coun∣tries.</P>
<P>His character excited considerable curiosity in this observer. It was not easy to reconcile his con∣version to the Romish faith, with those proofs of knowledge and capacity that were exhibited by him on different occasions. A suspicion was, sometimes, admitted, that his belief was counterfeited for some political purpose. The most careful observation, however, produced no discovery. His manners were, at all times, harmless and inartificial, and his habits those of a lover of contemplation and seclu∣sion. He appeared to have contracted an affection for Pleyel, who was not slow to return it.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>My friend, after a month's residence in this city, returned into France, and, since that period, had heard nothing concerning Carwin till his appear∣ance at Mettingen.</P>
<P>On this occasion Carwin had received Pleyel's greeting with a certain distance and solemnity to which the latter had not been accustomed. He had waved noticing the inquiries of Pleyel respecting his desertion of Spain, in which he had formerly de∣clared that it was his purpose to spend his life. He had assiduously diverted the attention of the latter to indifferent topics, but was still, on every theme, as eloquent and judicious as formerly. Why he had assumed the garb of a rustic, Pleyel was una∣ble to conjecture. Perhaps it might be poverty, perhaps he was swayed by motives which it was his interest to conceal, but which were connected with consequences of the utmost moment.</P>
<P>Such was the sum of my friend's information. I was not sorry to be left alone during the greater part of this day. Every employment was irksome which did not leave me at liberty to meditate. I had now a new subject on which to exercise my thoughts. Before evening I should be ushered into his presence, and listen to those tones whose magi∣cal and thrilling power I had already experienced. But with what new images would he then be ac∣companied?</P>
<P>Carwin was an adherent to the Romish faith, yet was an Englishman by birth, and, perhaps, a protestant by education. He had adopted Spain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his country, and had intimated a design to spend his days there, yet now was an inhabitant of this district, and disguised by the habiliments of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>own! What could have obliterated the impres∣sions of his youth, and made him abjure his religion
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
and his country? What subsequent events had in∣troduced so total a change in his plans? In with∣drawing from Spain, had he reverted to the religion of his ancestors; or was it true, that his former conversion was deceitful, and that his conduct had been swayed by motives which it was prudent to conceal?</P>
<P>Hours were consumed in revolving these ideas. My meditations were intense; and, when the series was broken, I began to reflect with astonishment on my situation. From the death of my parents, till the commencement of this year, my life had been serene and blissful, beyond the ordinary portion of humanity; but, now, my bosom was corroded by anxiety. I was visited by dread of unknown dan∣gers, and the future was a scene over which clouds rolled, and thunders muttered. I compared the cause with the effect, and they seemed dispropor∣tioned to each other. All unaware, and in a manner which I had no power to explain, I was pushed from my immoveable and lofty station, and cast upon a sea of troubles.</P>
<P>I determined to be my brother's visitant on this evening, yet my resolves were not unattended with wavering and reluctance. Pleyel's insinuations that I was in love, affected, in no degree, my belief, yet the consciousness that this was the opinion of one who would, probably, be present at our intro∣duction to each other, would excite all that con∣fusion which the passion itself is apt to produce. This would confirm him in his error, and call forth new railleries. His mirth, when exerted upon this topic, was the source of the bitterest vexation. Had he been aware of its influence upon my hap∣piness, his temper would not have allowed him to persist; but this influence, it was my chief endea∣vour
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
to conceal. That the belief of my having bestowed my heart upon another, produced in my friend none but ludicrous sensations, was the true cause of my distress; but if this had been disco∣vered by him, my distress would have been un∣speakably aggravated.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as evening arrived, I performed my vi∣sit. Carwin made one of the company, into which I was ushered. Appearances were the fame as when I before beheld him. His garb was equally negligent and rustic. I gazed upon his counte∣nance with new curiosity. My situation was such as to enable me to bestow upon it a deliberate ex∣amination. Viewed at more leisure, it lost none of its wonderful properties. I could not deny my homage to the intelligence expressed in it, but was wholly uncertain, whether he were an object to be dreaded or adored, and whether his powers had been exerted to evil or to good.</P>
<P>He was sparing in discourse; but whatever he said was pregnant with meaning, and uttered with rectitude of articulation, and force of emphasis, of which I had entertained no conception previously to my knowledge of him. Notwithstanding the uncouthness of his garb, his manners were not un∣polished. All topics were handled by him with skill, and without pedantry or affectation. He uttered no sentiment calculated to produce a disad∣vantageous impression: on the contrary, his obser∣vations denoted a mind alive to every generous and heroic feeling. They were introduced without pa∣rade, and accompanied with that degree of earnest∣ness which indicates sincerity.</P>
<P>He parted from us not till late, refusing an invi∣tation to spend the night here, but readily consented to repeat his visit. His visits were frequently re∣peated. Each day introduced us to a more intimate
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
acquaintance with his sentiments, but left us wholly in the dark, concerning that about which we were most inquisitive. He studiously avoided all mention of his past or present situation. Even the place of his abode in the city he concealed from us.</P>
<P>Our sphere, in this respect, being somewhat limited, and the intellectual endowments of this man being indisputably great, his deportment was more diligently marked, and copiously commented on by us, than you, perhaps, will think the circumstances warranted. Not a gesture, or glance, or accent, that was not, in our private assemblies, discussed, and inferences deduced from it. It may well be thought that he modelled his behaviour by an un∣common standard, when, with all our opportuni∣ties and accuracy of observation, we were able, for a long time, to gather no satisfactory informa∣tion. He afforded us no ground on which to build even a plausible conjecture.</P>
<P>There is a degree of familiarity which takes place between constant associates, that justifies the negligence of many rules of which, in an earlier period of their intercourse, politeness requires the exact observance. Inquiries into our condition are allowable when they are prompted by a disinterested concern for our welfare; and this solicitude is not only pardonable, but may justly be demanded from those who chuse us for their companions. This state of things was more slow to arrive on this oc∣casion than on most others, on account of the gra∣vity and loftiness of this man's behaviour.</P>
<P>Pleyel, however, began, at length, to employ re∣gular means for this end. He occasionally alluded to the circumstances in which they had formerly met, and remarked the incongruousness between the religion and habits of a Spaniard, with those of a
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
native of Britain. He expressed his astonishment at meeting our guest in this corner of the globe, especially as, when they parted in Spain, he was taught to believe that Carwin should never leave that country. He insinuated, that a change so great must have been prompted by motives of a singular and momentous kind.</P>
<P>No answer, or an answer wide of the purpose, was generally made to these insinuations. Britons and Spaniards, he said, are votaries of the same Deity, and square their faith by the same precepts; their ideas are drawn from the same fountains of literature, and they speak dialects of the same tongue; their government and laws have more re∣semblances than differences; they were formerly provinces of the same civil, and till lately, of the same religious, Empire.</P>
<P>As to the motives which induce men to change the place of their abode, these must unavoidably be fleeting and mutable. If not bound to one spot by conjugal or parental ties, or by the nature of that employment to which we are indebted for subsistence, the inducements to change are far more numerous and powerful, than opposite in∣ducements.</P>
<P>He spoke as if desirous of shewing that he was not aware of the tendency of Pleyel's remarks; yet, certain tokens were apparent, that proved him by no means wanting in penetration. These tokens were to be read in his countenance, and not in his words. When any thing was said, indicating cu∣riosity in us, the gloom of his countenance was deepened, his eyes sunk to the ground, and his wonted air was not resumed without visible strug∣gle. Hence, it was obvious to infer, that some in∣cidents of his life were reflected on by him with
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
regret; and that, since these incidents were carefully concealed, and even that regret which flowed from them laboriously stifled, they had not been merely disastrous. The secrecy that was observed ap∣peared not designed to provoke or baffle the inqui∣sitive, but was prompted by the shame, or by the prudence of guilt.</P>
<P>These ideas, which were adopted by Pleyel and my brother, as well as myself, hindered us from employing more direct means for accomplishing our wishes. Questions might have been put in such terms, that no room should be left for the pre∣tence of misapprehension, and if modesty merely had been the obstacle, such questions would not have been wanting; but we considered, that, if the disclosure were productive of pain or disgrace, it was inhuman to extort it.</P>
<P>Amidst the various topics that were discussed in his presence, allusions were, of course, made to the inexplicable events that had lately happened. At those times, the words and looks of this man were objects of my particular attention. The subject was extraordinary; and any one whose experience or reflections could throw any light upon it, was entitled to my gratitude. As this man was en∣lightened by reading and travel, I listened with eagerness to the remarks which he should make.</P>
<P>At first, I entertained a kind of apprehension, that the tale would be heard by him with incre∣dulity and secret ridicule. I had formerly heard stories that resembled this in some of their myste∣rious circumstances, but they were, commonly, heard by me with contempt. I was doubtful, whe∣ther the same impression would not now be made on the mind of our guest; but I was mistaken in my fears.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"/>He heard them with seriousness, and without any marks either of surprize or incredulity. He pursued, with visible pleasure, that kind of disquisition which was naturally suggested by them. His fancy was eminently vigorous and prolific, and if he did not persuade us▪ that human beings are, sometimes, ad∣mitted to a sensible intercourse with the author of nature, he, at least, won over our inclination to the cause. He merely deduced, from his own reason∣ings, that such intercourse was probable; but con∣fessed that, though he was acquainted with many instances somewhat similar to those which had been related by us, none of them were perfectly exempt∣ed from the suspicion of human agency.</P>
<P>On being requested to relate these instances, he amused us with many curious details. His narra∣tives were constructed with so much skill, and re∣hearsed with so much energy, that all the effects of a dramatic exhibition were frequently produced by them. Those that were most coherent and most minute, and, of consequence, least entitled to credit, were yet rendered probable by the exquisite art of this rhetorician. For every difficulty that was suggested, a ready and plausible solution was fur∣nished. Mysterious voices had always a share in producing the catastrophe, but they were always to be explained on some known principles, either as reflected into a focus, or communicated through a tube. I could not but remark that his narratives, however complex or marvellous, contained no in∣stance sufficiently parallel to those that had befallen ourselves, and in which the solution was applicable to our own case.</P>
<P>My brother was a much more sanguine reasoner than our guest. Even in some of the facts which were related by Carwin, he maintained the proba∣bility
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
of celestial interference, when the latter was disposed to deny it, and had found, as he imagined, footsteps of an human agent. Pleyel was by no means equally credulous. He scrupled not to deny faith to any testimony but that of his senses, and allowed the facts which had lately been supported by this testimony, not to mould his belief, but merely to give birth to doubts.</P>
<P>It was soon observed that Carwin adopted, in some degree, a similar distinction. A tale of this kind, related by others, he would believe, provided it was explicable upon known principles; but that such notices were actually communicated by beings of an higher order, he would believe only when his own ears were assailed in a manner which could not be otherwise accounted for. Civility forbad him to contradict my brother or myself, but his under∣standing refused to acquiesce in our testimony. Be∣sides, he was disposed to question whether the voices heard in the temple, at the foot of the hill, and in my closet, were not really uttered by human or∣gans. On this supposition he was desired to ex∣plain how the effect was produced.</P>
<P>He answered, that the power of mimickry was very common. Catharine's voice might easily be imitated by one at the foot of the hill, who would find no difficulty in eluding, by flight, the search of Wieland. The tidings of the death of the Saxon lady were uttered by one near at hand, who over∣heard the conversation, who conjectured her death, and whose conjecture happened to accord with the truth. That the voice appeared to come from the ceiling was to be considered as an illusion of the fancy. The cry for help, heard in the hall on the night of my adventure, was to be ascribed to an human creature, who actually stood in the hall
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
when he uttered it. It was of no moment, he said, that we could not explain by what motives he that made the signal was led hither. How imperfectly acquainted were we with the condition and designs of the beings that surrounded us? The city was near at hand, and thousands might there exist whose powers and purposes might easily explain whatever was mysterious in this transaction. As to the closet dialogue, he was obliged to adopt one of two suppositions, and affirm either that it was fashioned in my own fancy, or that it actually took place between two persons in the closet.</P>
<P>Such was Carwin's mode of explaining these appearances. It is such, perhaps, as would com∣mend itself as most plausible to the most sagacious minds, but it was insufficient to impart conviction to us. As to the treason that was meditated against me, it was doubtless just to conclude that it was either real or imaginary; but that it was real was attested by the mysterious warning in the summer-house, the secret of which I had hitherto locked up in my own breast.</P>
<P>A month passed away in this kind of intercourse. As to Carwin, our ignorance was in no degree enlightened respecting his genuine character and views. Appearances were uniform. No man possessed a larger store of knowledge, or a greater degree of skill in the communication of it to others; Hence he was regarded as an inestimable addition to our society. Considering the distance of my brother's house from the city, he was frequently prevailed upon to pass the night where he spent the evening. Two days seldom elapsed without a visit from him; hence he was regarded as a kind of in∣mate of the house. He entered and departed with∣out ceremony. When he arrived he received an
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
unaffected welcome, and when he chose to retire, no importunities were used to induce him to re∣main.</P>
<P>The temple was the principal scene of our social enjoyments; yet the felicity that we tasted when as∣sembled in this asylum, was but the gleam of a former sun-shine. Carwin never parted with his gravity. The inscrutableness of his character, and the uncertainty whether his fellowship tended to good or to evil, were seldom absent from our minds. This circumstance powerfully contributed in sadden us.</P>
<P>My heart was the seat of growing disquietudes. This change in one who had formerly been charac∣terized by all the exuberances of soul, could not fail to be remarked by my friends. My brother was always a pattern of solemnity. My sister was clay, moulded by the circumstances in which she hap∣pened to be placed. There was but one whose de∣portment remains to be described as being of im∣portance to our happiness. Had Pleyel likewise dismissed his vivacity?</P>
<P>He was as whimsical and jestful as ever, but he was not happy. The truth, in this respect, was of too much importance to me not to make me a vigilant observer. His mirth was easily perceived to be the fruit of exertion. When his thoughts wandered from the company, an air of dissatisfac∣tion and impatience stole across his features. Even the punctuality and frequency of his visits were somewhat lessened. It may be supposed that my own uneasiness was heightened by these tokens; but, strange as it may seem, I found, in the present state of my mind, no relief but in the persuasion that Pleyel was unhappy.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94"/>That unhappiness, indeed, depended, for its value in my eyes, on the cause that produced it. It did not arise from the death of the Saxon lady: it was not a contagious emanation from the countenances of Wieland or Carwin. There was but one other source whence it could flow. A nameless ecstacy thrilled through my frame when any new proof occurred that the ambiguousness of my behaviour was the cause.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>MY brother had received a new book from Ger∣many. It was a tragedy, and the first attempt of a Saxon poet, of whom my brother had been taught to entertain the highest expectations. The ex∣ploits of Zisca, the Bohemian hero, were woven into a dramatic series and connection. According to German custom, it was minute and diffuse, and dictated by an adventurous and lawless fancy. It was a chain of audacious acts, and unheard-of dis∣asters. The moated fortress, and the thicket; the ambush and the battle; and the conflict of headlong passions, were pourtrayed in wild numbers, and with terrific energy. An afternoon was set apart to rehearse this performance. The language was familiar to all of us but Carwin, whose company, therefore, was tacitly dispensed with.</P>
<P>The morning previous to this intended rehearsal, I spent at home. My mind was occupied with re∣flections relative to my own situation. The sen∣timent which lived with chief energy in my heart, was connected with the image of Pleyel. In the midst of my anguish, I had not been destitute of consolation. His late deportment had given spring to my hopes. Was not the hour at hand, which should render me the happiest of human crea∣tures? He suspected that I looked with favorable eyes upon Carwin. Hence arose disquietudes, which he struggled in vain to conceal. He loved me, but was hopeless that his love would be com∣pensated. Is it not time, said I, to rectify this error? But by what means is this to be effected?
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
It can only be done by a change of deportment in me; but how must I demean myself for this pur∣pose?</P>
<P>I must not speak. Neither eyes, nor lips, must impart the information. He must not be assured that my heart is his, previous to the tender of his own; but he must be convinced that it has not been given to another; he must be supplied with space whereon to build a doubt as to the true state of my affections; he must be prompted to avow himself. The line of delicate propriety; how hard it is, not to fall short, and not to overleap it!</P>
<P>This afternoon we shall meet at the temple. We shall not separate till late. It will be his province to accompany me home. The airy expanse is without a speck. This breeze is usually stedfast, and its promise of a bland and cloudless evening, may be trusted. The moon will rise at eleven, and at that hour, we shall wind along this bank. Possibly that hour may decide my fate. If suitable encouragement be given, Pleyel will reveal his soul to me; and I, ere I reach this threshold, will be made the happiest of beings. And is this good to be mine? Add wings to thy speed, sweet evening; and thou, moon, I charge thee, shroud thy beams at the moment when my Pleyel whispers love. I would not for the world, that the burning blushes, and the mounting raptures of that moment, should be visible.</P>
<P>But what encouragement is wanting? I must be regardful of insurmountable limits. Yet when minds are imbued with a genuine sympathy, are not words and looks superfluous? Are not motion and touch sufficient to impart feelings such as mine? Has he not eyed me at moments, when the pressure of his hand has thrown me into tumults, and was
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
it possible that he mistook the impetuosities of love, for the eloquence of indignation?</P>
<P>But the hastening evening will decide. Would it were come! And yet I shudder at its near ap∣proach. An interview that must thus terminate, is surely to be wished for by me; and yet it is not without its terrors. Would to heaven it were come and gone!</P>
<P>I feel no reluctance, my friends to be thus ex∣plicit. Time was, when these emotions would be hidden with immeasurable solicitude, from every human eye. Alas! these airy and fleeting im∣pulses of shame are gone. My scruples were preposterous and criminal. They are bred in all hearts, by a perverse and vicious education, and they would still have maintained their place in my heart, had not my portion been set in misery. My errors have taught me thus much wisdom; that those sentiments which we ought not to disclose, it is criminal to harbour.</P>
<P>It was proposed to begin the rehearsal at four o'clock; I counted the minutes as they passed; their flight was at once too rapid and too slow; my sensations were of an excruciating kind; I could taste no food, nor apply to any task, nor enjoy a moment's repose: when the hour arrived, I has∣tened to my brother's.</P>
<P>Pleyel was not there. He had not yet come. On ordinary occasions, he was eminent for punc∣tuality. He had testified great eagerness to share in the pleasures of this rehearsal. He was to divide the task with my brother, and, in tasks like these, he always engaged with peculiar zeal. His elo∣cution was less sweet than sonorous; and, there∣fore, better adapted than the mellifluences of his friend, to the outrageous vehemence of this drama.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98"/>What could detain him? Perhaps he lingered through forgetfulness. Yet this was incredible. Never had his memory been known to fail upon even more trivial occasions. Not less impossible was it, that the scheme had lost its attractions, and that he staid, because his coming would afford him no gratification. But why should we expect him to adhere to the minute?</P>
<P>An half hour elapsed, but Pleyel was still at a distance. Perhaps he had misunderstood the hour which had been proposed. Perhaps he had con∣ceived that to-morrow, and not to-day, had been selected for this purpose: but no. A review of pre∣ceding circumstances demonstrated that such mis∣apprehension was impossible; for he had himself proposed this day, and this hour. This day, his attention would not otherwise be occupied; but to∣morrow, an indispensible engagement was foreseen, by which all his time would be engrossed: his de∣tention, therefore, must be owing to some unfore∣seen and extraordinary event. Our conjectures were vague, tumultuous, and sometimes fearful. His sickness and his death might possibly have de∣tained him.</P>
<P>Tortured with suspense, we sat gazing at each other, and at the path which led from the road. Every horseman that passed was, for a moment, imagined to be him. Hour succeeded hour, and the sun, gradually declining, at length, disappeared. Every signal of his coming proved fallacious, and our hopes were at length dismissed. His absence affected my friends in no insupportable degree. They should be obliged, they said, to defer this un∣dertaking till the morrow; and, perhaps, their im∣patient curiosity would compel them to dispense en∣tirely with his presence. No doubt, some harmless
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
occurrence had diverted him from his purpose; and they trusted that they should receive a satis∣factory account of him in the morning.</P>
<P>It may be supposed that this disappointment affect∣ed me in a very different manner. I turned aside my head to conceal my tears. I fled into solitude, to give vent to my reproaches, without interruption or restraint. My heart was ready to burst with indignation and grief. Pleyel was not the only ob∣ject of my keen but unjust upbraiding. Deeply did I execrate my own folly. Thus fallen into ruins was the gay fabric which I had reared! Thus had my golden vision melted into air!</P>
<P>How fondly did I dream that Pleyel was a lover! If he were, would he have suffered any obstacle to hinder his coming? Blind and infatuated man! I exclaimed. Thou sportest with happiness. The good that is offered thee, thou hast the insolence and folly to refuse. Well, I will henceforth intrust may felicity to no one's keeping but my own.</P>
<P>The first agonies of this disappointment would not allow me to be reasonable or just. Every ground on which I had built the persuasion that Pleyel was not unimpressed in my favor, appeared to vanish. It seemed as if I had been misled into this opinion, by the most palpable illusions.</P>
<P>I made some trifling excuse, and returned, much earlier than I expected, to my own house. I re∣tired early to my chamber, without designing to sleep. I placed myself at a window, and gave the reins to reflection.</P>
<P>The hateful and degrading impulses which had lately controuled me were, in some degree, re∣moved. New dejection succeeded, but was now produced by contemplating my late behaviour. Surely that passion is worthy to be abhorred which
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
obscures our understanding, and urges us to the commission of injustice. What right had I to ex∣pect his attendance? Had I not demeaned myself like one indifferent to his happiness, and as having bestowed my regards upon another? His absence might be prompted by the love which I considered his absence as a proof that he wanted. He came not because the sight of me, the spectacle of my coldness or aversion, contributed to his despair. Why should I prolong, by hyprocrisy or silence, his misery as well as my own? Why not deal with him explicitly, and assure him of the truth?</P>
<P>You will hardly believe that, in obedience to this suggestion, I rose for the purpose of ordering a light, that I might instantly make this confession in a letter. A second thought shewed me the rash∣ness of this scheme, and I wondered by what in∣firmity of mind I could be betrayed into a mo∣mentary approbation of it. I saw with the utmost clearness that a confession like that would be the most remediless and unpardonable outrage upon the dignity of my sex, and utterly unworthy of that passion which controuled me.</P>
<P>I resumed my seat and my musing. To account for the absence of Pleyel became once more the scope of my conjectures. How many incidents might occur to raise an insuperable impediment in his way? When I was a child, a scheme of plea∣sure, in which he and his sister were parties, had been, in like manner, frustrated by his absence; but his absence, in that instance, had been occasioned by his falling from a boat into the river, in conse∣quence of which he had run the most imminent hazard of being drowned. Here was a second dis∣appointment endured by the same persons, and pro∣duced by his failure. Might it not originate in the
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
same cause? Had he not designed to cross the river that morning to make some necessary purchases in Jersey? He had preconcerted to return to his own house to dinner; but, perhaps, some disaster had befallen him. Experience had taught me the inse∣curity of a canoe, and that was the only kind of boat which Pleyel used: I was, likewise, actuated by an hereditary dread of water. These circum∣stances combined to bestow considerable plausibility on this conjecture; but the consternation with which I began to be seized was allayed by reflect∣ing, that if this disaster had happened my brother would have received the speediest information of it. The consolation which this idea imparted was ra∣vished from me by a new thought. This disaster might have happened, and his family not be appriz∣ed of it. The first intelligence of his fate may be communicated by the livid corpse which the tide may cast, many days hence, upon the shore.</P>
<P>Thus was I distressed by opposite conjectures: thus was I tormented by phantoms of my own cre∣ation. It was not always thus. I can ascertain the date when my mind became the victim of this imbecility; perhaps it was coeval with the inroad of a fatal passion; a passion that will never rank me in the number of its eulogists; it was alone sufficient to the extermination of my peace: it was itself a plenteous source of calamity, and needed not the concurrence of other evils to take away the attractions of existence, and dig for me an untime∣ly grave.</P>
<P>The state of my mind naturally introduced a train of reflections upon the dangers and cares which inevitably beset an human being. By no violent transition was I led to ponder on the tur∣bulent life and mysterious end of my father. I
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
cherished, with the utmost veneration, the memory of this man, and every relique connected with his fate was preserved with the most scrupulous care. Among these was to be numbered a manuscript, containing memoirs of his own life. The narrative was by no means recommended by its eloquence; but neither did all its value flow from my relation∣ship to the author. Its stile had an unaffected and picturesque simplicity. The great variety and cir∣cumstantial display of the incidents, together with their intrinsic importance, as descriptive of human manners and passions, made it the most useful book in my collection. It was late; but being sensible of no inclination to sleep, I resolved to betake my∣self to the perusal of it.</P>
<P>To do this it was requisite to procure a light. The girl had long since retired to her chamber: it was therefore proper to wait upon myself. A lamp, and the means of lighting it, were only to be found in the kitchen. Thither I resolved forthwith to repair; but the light was of use merely to enable me to read the book. I knew the shelf and the spot where it stood. Whether I took down the book, or prepared the lamp in the first place, ap∣peared to be a matter of no moment. The latter was preferred, and, leaving my seat, I approached the closet in which, as I mentioned formerly, my books and papers were deposited.</P>
<P>Suddenly the remembrance of what had lately passed in this closet occurred. Whether midnight was approaching, or had passed, I knew not. I was, as then, alone, and defenceless. The wind was in that direction in which, aided by the deathlike repose of nature, it brought to me the murmur of the water-fall. This was mingled with that solemn and enchanting sound, which a breeze produces
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
among the leaves of pines. The words of that mysterious dialogue, then fearful import, and the wild excess to which I was transported by my ter∣rors, filled my imagination anew. My steps faul∣tered, and I stood a moment to recover myself.</P>
<P>I prevailed on myself at length to move towards the closet. I touched the lock, but my fingers were powerless; I was visited afresh by unconquerable apprehensions. A sort of belief darted into my mind, that some being was concealed within, whose purposes were evil. I began to contend with those fears, when it occurred to me that I might, without impropriety, go for a lamp previously to opening the closet. I receded a few steps; but before I reached my chamber door my thoughts took a new direction. Motion seemed to produce a mechanical influence upon me. I was ashamed of my weak∣ness. Besides, what aid could be afforded me by a lamp?</P>
<P>My fears had pictured to themselves no precise object. It would be difficult to depict, in words, the ingredients and hues of that phantom which haunted me. An hand invisible and of preterna∣tural strength, lifted by human passions, and select∣ing my life for its aim, were parts of this terrific image. All places were alike accessible to this foe, or if his empire were restricted by local bounds, those bounds were utterly inscrutable by me. But had I not been told by some one in league with this enemy, that every place but the recess in the bank was exempt from danger?</P>
<P>I returned to the closet, and once more put my hand upon the lock. O! may my ears lose their sensibility, ere they be again assailed by a shriek so terrible! Not merely my understanding was sub∣dued by the sound: it acted on my nerves like an
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
edge of steel. It appeared to cut asunder the fibres of my brain, and rack every joint with agony.</P>
<P>The cry, loud and piercing as it was, was never∣theless human. No articulation was ever more distinct. The breath which accompanied it did not fan my hair, yet did every circumstance com∣bine to persuade me that the lips which uttered it touched my very shoulder.</P>
<P>"Hold! Hold!" were the words of this tremen∣dous prohibition, in whose tone the whole soul seemed to be rapt up, and every energy converted into eagerness and terror.</P>
<P>Shuddering▪ I dashed myself against the wall, and by the same involuntary impulse, turned my face backward to examine the mysterious monitor. The moon-light streamed into each window, and every corner of the room was conspicuous, and yet I beheld nothing!</P>
<P>The interval was too brief to be artificially mea∣sured, between the utterance of these words, and my scrutiny directed to the quarter whence they came. Yet if a human being had been there, could he fail to have been visible? Which of my senses was the prey of a fatal illusion? The shock which the sound produced was still felt in every part of my frame. The sound, therefore, could not but be a genuine commotion. But that I had heard it, was not more true than that the being who uttered it was stationed at my right ear; yet my attendant was invisible.</P>
<P>I cannot describe the state of my thoughts at that moment. Surprize had mastered my faculties. My frame shook, and the vital current was congealed. I was conscious only to the vehemence of my sen∣sations. This condition could not be lasting. Like a tide, which suddenly mounts to an overwhelming
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
height, and then gradually subsides, my confusion slowly gave place to order, and my tumults to a calm. I was able to deliberate and move. I re∣sumed my feet, and advanced into the midst of the room. Upward, and behind, and on each side, I threw penetrating glances. I was not satisfied with one examination. He that hitherto refused to be seen, might change his purpose, and on the next survey be clearly distinguishable.</P>
<P>Solitude imposes least restraint upon the fancy. Dark is less fertile of images than the feeble lustre of the moon. I was alone, and the walls were chequered by shadowy forms. As the moon passed behind a cloud and emerged, these shadows seemed to be endowed with life, and to move. The apart∣ment was open to the breeze, and the curtain was occasionally blown from its ordinary position. This motion was not unaccompanied with sound. I failed not to snatch a look, and to listen when this motion and this sound occurred. My belief that my monitor was posted near, was strong, and in∣stantly converted these appearances to tokens of his presence, and yet I could discern nothing.</P>
<P>When my thoughts were at length permitted to revert to the past, the first idea that occurred was the resemblance between the words of the voice which I had just heard, and those which had termi∣nated my dream in the summer-house. There are means by which we are able to distinguish a sub∣stance from a shadow, a reality from the phantom of a dream. The pit, my brother beckoning me forward, the seizure of my arm, and the voice be∣hind, were surely imaginary. That these incidents were fashioned in my sleep, is supported by the same indubitable evidence that compels me to be∣lieve myself awake at present; yet the words and
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
the voice were the same. Then, by some inexpli∣cable contrivance, I was aware of the danger, while my actions and sensations were those of one wholly unacquainted with it. Now, was it not equally true that my actions and persuasions were at war? Had not the belief, that evil lurked in the closet, gained admittance, and had not my actions beto∣kened an unwarrantable security? To obviate the effects of my infatuation, the same means had been used.</P>
<P>In my dream, he that tempted me to my destruc∣tion, was my brother. Death was ambushed in my path. From what evil was I now rescued? What minister or implement of ill was shut up in this recess? Who was it whose suffocating grasp I was to feel, should I dare to enter it? What mon∣strous conception is this? my brother!</P>
<P>No; protection, and not injury is his province. Strange and terrible chimera! Yet it would not be suddenly dismissed. It was surely no vulgar agency that gave this form to my fears. He to whom all parts of time are equally present, whom no con∣tingency approaches, was the author of that spell which now seized upon me. Life was dear to me. No consideration was present that enjoined me to relinquish it. Sacred duty combined with every spontaneous sentiment to endear to me my being. Should I not shudder when my being was endan∣gered? But what emotion should possess me when the arm lifted against me was Wieland's?</P>
<P>Ideas exist in our minds that can be accounted for by no established laws. Why did I dream that my brother was my foe? Why but because an omen of my fate was ordained to be communi∣cated? Yet what salutary end did it serve? Did it arm me with caution to elude, or fortitude to
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
bear the evils to which I was reserved? My pre∣sent thoughts were, no doubt, indebted for their hue to the similitude existing between these incidents and those of my dream. Surely it was phrenzy that dictated my deed. That a ruffian was hidden in the closet, was an idea, the genuine tendency of which was to urge me to flight. Such had been the effect formerly produced. Had my mind been simply occupied with this thought at present, no doubt, the same impulse would have been expe∣rienced; but now it was my brother whom I was irresistably persuaded to regard as the contriver of that ill of which I had been forewarned. This persuasion did not extenuate my fears or my dan∣ger. Why then did I again approach the closet and withdraw the bolt? My resolution was instantly conceived, and executed without faultering.</P>
<P>The door was formed of light materials. The lock, of simple structure, easily forewent its hold. It opened into the room, and commonly moved upon its hinges, after being unfastened, without any effort of mine. This effort, however, was be∣stowed upon the present occasion. It was my purpose to open it with quickness, but the exer∣tion which I made was ineffectual. It refused to open.</P>
<P>At another time, this circumstance would not have looked with a face of mystery. I should have supposed some casual obstruction, and repeat∣ed my efforts to surmount it. But now my mind was accessible to no conjecture but one. The door was hindered from opening by human force. Surely, here was new cause for affright. This was confirmation proper to decide my conduct. Now was all ground of hesitation taken away. What could be supposed but that I deserted the chamber
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
and the house? that I at least endeavoured no longer to withdraw the door?</P>
<P>Have I not said that my actions were dictated by phrenzy? My reason had forborne, for a time, to suggest or to sway my resolves. I reiterated my endeavours. I exerted all my force to overcome the obstacle, but in vain. The strength that was exerted to keep it shut, was superior to mine.</P>
<P>A casual observer might, perhaps, applaud the audaciousness of this conduct. Whence, but from an habitual defiance of danger, could my perseve∣rance arise? I have already assigned, as distinctly as I am able, the cause of it. The frantic concep∣tion that my brother was within, that the resist∣ance made to my design was exerted by him, had rooted itself in my mind. You will comprehend the height of this infatuation, when I tell you, that, finding all my exertions vain. I betook myself to exclamations. Surely I was utterly bereft of un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>Now had I arrived at the crisis of my fate. "O! hinder not the door to open," I exclaimed, in a tone that had less of fear than of grief in it. "I know you well. Come forth, but harm me not. I be∣seech you come forth."</P>
<P>I had taken my hand from the lock, and removed to a small distance from the door. I had scarcely uttered these words, when the door swung upon its hinges, and displayed to my view the interior of the closet. Whoever was within, was shrouded in darkness. A few seconds passed without inter∣ruption of the silence. I knew not what to expect or to fear. My eyes would not stray from the recess. Presently, a deep sigh was heard. The quarter from which it came heightened the eager∣ness of my gaze. Some one approached from the
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
father end. I quickly perceived the outlines of a human figure. Its steps were irresolute and slow, I recoiled as it advanced.</P>
<P>By coming at length within the verge of the room, his form was clearly distinguishable. I had prefigured to myself a very different personage. The face that presented itself was the last that I should desire to meet at an hour, and in a place like this. My wonder was stifled by my fears. Assas∣sins had lurked in this recess. Some divine voice warned me of danger, that at this moment awaited me. I had spurned the intimation, and challenged my adversary.</P>
<P>I recalled the mysterious countenance and du∣bious character of Carwin. What motive but atrocious ones could guide his steps hither? I was alone. My habit suited the hour, and the place, and the warmth of the season. All succour was remote. He had placed himself between me and the door. My frame shook with the vehemence of my apprehensions.</P>
<P>Yet I was not wholly lost to myself: I vigilantly marked his demeanour. His looks were grave, but not without perturbation. What species of in∣quietude it betrayed, the light was not strong enough to enable me to discover. He stood still; but his eyes wandered from one object to another. When these powerful organs were fixed upon me, I shrunk into myself. At length, he broke silence. Earnestness, and not embarrassment, was in his tone. He advanced close to me while he spoke.</P>
<P>"What voice was that which lately addressed you?"</P>
<P>He paused for an answer; but observing my tre∣pidation, he resumed, with undiminished solemnity: "Be not terrified. Whoever he was, he hast done
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
you an important service. I need not ask you if it were the voice of a companion. That sound was beyond the compass of human organs. The know∣ledge that enabled him to tell you who was in the closet, was obtained by incomprehensible means.</P>
<P>"You knew that Carwin was there. Were you not apprized of his intents? The same power could impart the one as well as the other. Yet, know∣ing these, you persisted. Audacious girl! but, per∣haps, you confided in his guardianship. Your con∣fidence was just. With succour like this at hand you may safely defy me.</P>
<P>"He is my eternal foe; the baffler of my best concerted schemes. Twice have you been saved by his accursed interposition. But for him I should long ere now have borne away the spoils of your honor."</P>
<P>He looked at me with greater stedfastness than before. I became every moment more anxious for my safety. It was with difficulty I stammered out an entreaty that he would instantly depart, or suffer me to do so. He paid no regard to my request, but proceeded in a more impassioned manner.</P>
<P>"What is it you fear? Have I not told you, you are safe? Has not one in whom you more rea∣sonably place trust assured you of it? Even if I execute my purpose, what injury is done? Your prejudices will call it by that name, but it merits it not.</P>
<P>"I was impelled by a sentiment that does you honor; a sentiment, that would sanctify my deed; but, whatever it be, you are safe. Be this chimera still worshipped; I will do nothing to pollute it." There he stopped.</P>
<P>The accents and gestures of this man left me drained of all courage. Surely, on no other occa∣sion
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
should I have been thus pusillanimous. My state I regarded as a hopeless one. I was wholly at the mercy of this being. Whichever way I turned my eyes, I saw no avenue by which I might escape. The resources of my personal strength, my ingenuity, and my eloquence, I estimated at nothing. The dignity of virtue, and the force of truth, I had been accustomed to celebrate; and had frequently vaunted of the conquests which I should make with their assistance.</P>
<P>I used to suppose that certain evils could never befall a being in possession of a sound mind; that true virtue supplies us with energy whcih vice can never resist; that it was always in our power to, obstruct, by his own death, the designs of an enemy who aimed at less than our life. How was it that a sentiment like despair had now invaded me, and that I trusted to the protection of chance, or to the pity of my persecutor?</P>
<P>His words imparted some notion of the injury which he had meditated. He talked of obstacles that had risen in his way. He had relinquished his design. These sources supplied me with slender consolation. There was no security but in his ab∣sence. When I looked at myself, when I reflected on the hour and the place, I was overpowered by horror and dejection.</P>
<P>He was silent, museful, and inattentive to my situation, yet made no motion to depart. I was silent in my turn. What could I say? I was con∣fident that reason in this contest would be impo∣tent. I must owe my safety to his own suggestions. Whatever purpose brought him hither, he had changed it. Why then did he remain? His reso∣lutions might fluctuate, and the pause of a few mi∣nutes restore to him his first resolutions.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112"/>Yet was not this the man whom we had treated with unwearied kindness? Whose society was en∣deared to us by his intellectual elevation and ac∣complishments? Who had a thousand times expa∣tiated on the usefulness and beauty of virtue? Why should such a one be dreaded? If I could have forgotten the circumstances in which our interview had taken place, I might have treated his words as jests. Presently, he resumed:</P>
<P>"Fear me not: the space that severs us is small, and all visible succour is distant. You believe your∣self completely in my power; that you stand upon the brink of ruin. Such are your groundless fears. I cannot lift a finger to hurt you. Easier it would be to stop the moon in her course than to injure you. The power that protects you would crum∣ble my sinews, and reduce me to a heap of ashes in a moment, if I were to harbour a thought hos∣tile to your safety.</P>
<P>"Thus are appearances at length solved. Little did I expect that they originated hence. What a portion is assigned to you? Scanned by the eyes of this intelligence, your path will be without pits to swallow, or snares to entangle you. Environed by the arms of this protection, all artifices will be frustrated, and all malice repelled."</P>
<P>Here succeeded a new pause. I was still obser∣vant of every gesture and look. The tranquil so∣lemnity that had lately possessed his countenance gave way to a new expression. All now was tre∣pidation and anxiety.</P>
<P>"I must be gone," said he in a faltering accent▪ "Why do I linger here? I will not ask your for∣giveness. I see that your terrors are invincible Your pardon will be extorted by fear, and not dic¦tated by compassion. I must fly from you forever
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
He that could plot against your honor, must expect from you and your friends persecution and death. I must doom myself to endless exile."</P>
<P>Saying this, the hastily left the room. I listened while he descended the stairs, and, unbolting the outer door, went forth. I did not follow him with my eyes, as the moon-light would have enabled me to do. Relieved by his absence, and exhausted by the conflict of my fears, I threw myself on a chair, and resigned myself to those bewildering ideas which incidents like these could not fail to produce.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>ORDER could not readily be introduced into my thoughts. The voice still rung in my ears. Every accent that was uttered by Carwin was fresh in my remembrance. His unwelcome approach, the re∣cognition of his person, his hasty departure, pro∣duced a complex impression on my mind which no words can delineate. I strove to give a slower mo∣tion to my thoughts, and to regulate a confusion which became painful; but my efforts were nuga∣tory. I covered my eyes with my hand, and sat, I know not how long, without power to arrange or utter my conceptions.</P>
<P>I had remained for hours, as I believed, in ab∣solute solitude. No thought of personal danger had molested my tranquillity. I had made no pre∣paration for defence. What was it that suggested the design of perusing my father's manuscript? If, instead of this, I had retired to bed, and to sleep, to what fate might I not have been reserved? The ruffian, who must almost have suppressed his breath∣ings to screen himself from discovery, would have noticed this signal, and I should have awakened only to perish with affright, and to abhor myself. Could I have remained unconscious of my danger? Could I have tranquilly slept in the midst of so deadly a snare?</P>
<P>And who was he that threatened to destroy me? By what means could he hide himself in this closet? Surely he is gifted with supernatural power. Such is the enemy of whose attempts I was forewarned. Daily I had seen him and conversed with him. No∣thing
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
could be discerned through the impenetrable veil of his duplicity. When busied in conjectures, as to the author of the evil that was threatened, my mind did not light, for a moment, upon his image. Yet has he not avowed himself my enemy? Why should he be here if he had not meditated evil?</P>
<P>He confesses that this has been his second at∣tempt. What was the scene of his former conspi∣racy? Was it not he whose whispers betrayed him? Am I deceived; or was there not a faint re∣semblance between the voice of this man and that which talked of grasping my throat, and extinguish∣ing my life in a moment? Then he had a colleague in his crime; now he is alone. Then death was the scope of his thoughts; now an injury unspeak∣ably more dreadful. How thankful should I be to the power that has interposed to save me!</P>
<P>That power is invisible. It is subject to the cog∣nizance of one of my senses. What are the means that will inform me of what nature it is? He has set himself to counterwork the machinations of this man, who had menaced destruction to all that is dear to me, and whose cunning had surmounted every human impediment. There was none to rescue me from his grasp. My rashness even has∣tened the completion of his scheme, and precluded him from the benefits of deliberation. I had robbed him of the power to repent and forbear. Had I been apprized of the danger, I should have regarded my conduct as the means of rendering my escape from it impossible. Such, likewise, seem to have been the fears of my invisible protector. Else why that startling intreaty to refrain from opening the closet? By what inexplicable infatuation was I compelled to proceed?</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116"/>Yet my conduct was wise. Carwin, unable to comprehend my folly, ascribed my behaviour to my knowledge. He conceived himself previously de∣tected, and such detection being possible to flow only from <HI>my</HI> heavenly friend, and <HI>his</HI> enemy, his fears acquired additional strength.</P>
<P>He is apprized of the nature and intentions of this being. Perhaps he is a human agent. Yet, on that supposition his achievements are incredible. Why should I be selected as the object of his care; or, it a mere mortal, should I not recognize some one, whom, benefits imparted and received had prompted to love me? What were the limits and duration of his guardianship? Was the genius of my birth entrusted by divine benignity with this province? Are human faculties adequate to receive stronger proofs of the existence of unfettered and beneficent intelligences than I have received?</P>
<P>But who was this man's coadjutor? The voice that acknowledged an alliance in treachery with Carwin warned me to avoid the summer-house. He assured me that there only my safety was endan∣gered. His assurance, as it now appears, was fal∣lacious. Was there not deceit in his admonition? Was his compact really annulled? Some purpose was, perhaps, to be accomplished by preventing my future visits to that spot. Why was I enjoined silence to others, on the subject of this admonition, unless it were for some unauthorized and guilty purpose?</P>
<P>No one but myself was accustomed to visit it. Backward, it was hidden from distant view by the rock, and in front, it was screened from all examina∣tion, by creeping plants, and the branches of cedars. What recess could be more propitious to secrecy?
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
The spirit which haunted it formerly was pure and rapturous. It was a fane sacred to the memory of infantile days, and to blissful imaginations of the future! What a gloomy reverse had succeeded since the ominous arrival of this stranger! Now, perhaps, it is the scene of his meditations. Pur∣poses fraught with horror, that shun the light, and contemplate the pollution of innocence, are here engendered, and fostered, and reared to maturity.</P>
<P>Such were the ideas that, during the night, were tumultuously revolved by me. I reviewed every conversation in which Carwin had borne a part. I studied to discover the true inferences deducible from his deportment and words with regard to his former adventures and actual views. I pondered on the comments which he made on the relation which I had given of the closet dialogue. No new ideas suggested themselves in the course of this re∣view. My expectation had, from the first, been disappointed on the small degree of surprize which this narrative excited in him. He never explicitly declared his opinion as to the nature of those voices, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> decided whether they were real or visionary. He recommended no measures of caution or pre∣vention.</P>
<P>But what measures were now to be taken? Was the danger which threatened me at an end? Had I nothing more to fear? I was lonely, and with∣out means of defence. I could not calculate the mo∣tives and regulate the footsteps of this person. What certainty was there, that he would not re-assume his purposes, and swiftly return to the execution of them?</P>
<P>This idea covered me once more with dismay. How deeply did I regret the solitude in which I was placed, and how ardently did I desire the return of
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
day! But neither of these inconveniencies were susceptible of remedy. At first, it occurred to me to summon my servant, and make her spend the night in my chamber; but the inefficacy of this ex∣pedient to enhance my safety was easily seen. Once I resolved to leave the house, and retire to my bro∣ther's, but was deterred by reflecting on the un∣seasonableness of the hour, on the alarm which my arrival, and the account which I should be obliged to give, might occasion, and on the danger to which I might expose myself in the way thither. I began, likewise, to consider Carwin's return to molest me as exceedingly improbable. He had relinquished, of his own accord, his design, and departed without compulsion.</P>
<P>"Surely," said I, "there is omnipotence in the cause that changed the views of a man like Carwin. The divinity that shielded me from his attempts will take suitable care of my future safety. Thus to yield to my fears is to deserve that they should be real."</P>
<P>Scarcely had I uttered these words, when my attention was startled by the sound of footsteps. They denoted some one stepping into the piazza in front of my house. My new-born confidence was extinguished in a moment. Carwin, I thought, had repented his departure, and was hastily return∣ing. The possibility that his return was prompted by intentions consistent with my safety, found no place in my mind. Images of violation and mur∣der assailed me anew, and the terrors which suc∣ceeded almost incapacitated me from taking any measures for my defence. It was an impulse of which I was scarcely conscious, that made me fasten the lock and draw the bolts of my chamber door. Having done this, I threw myself on a seat; for I trembled to a degree which disabled me from stand∣ing,
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
and my soul was so perfectly absorbed in the act of listening, that almost the vital motions were stopped.</P>
<P>The door below creaked on its hinges. It was not again thrust to, but appeared to remain open. Footsteps entered, traversed the entry, and began to mount the stairs. How I detested the folly of not pursuing the man when he withdrew, and bolt∣ing after him the outer door! Might he not con∣ceive this omission to be a proof that my angel had deserted me, and be thereby fortified in guilt?</P>
<P>Every step on the stairs, which brought him nearer to my chamber, added vigor to my despera∣tion. The evil with which I was menaced was to be at any rate eluded. How little did I preconceive the conduct which, in an exigence like this, I should be prone to adopt. You will suppose that deliberation and despair would have suggested the same course of action, and that I should have, un∣hesitatingly, resorted to the best means of personal defence within my power. A penknife lay open upon my table. I remembered that it was there, and seized it. For what purpose you will scarcely inquire. It will be immediately supposed that I meant it for my last refuge, and that if all other means should fail, I should plunge it into the heart of my ravisher.</P>
<P>I have lost all faith in the stedfastness of human resolves. It was thus that in periods of calm I had determined to act. No cowardice had been held by me in greater abhorrence than that which prompt∣ed an injured female to destroy, not her injurer ere the injury was perpetrated, but herself when it was without remedy. Yet now this penknife appeared to me of no other use than to baffle my assailant, and prevent the crime by destroying myself. To
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
deliberate at such a time was impossible; but among the tumultuous suggestions of the moment, I do not recollect that it once occurred to me to use it as an instrument of direct defence.</P>
<P>The steps had now reached the second floor. Every footfall accelerated the completion, without augmenting, the certainty of evil. The conscious∣ness that the door was fast, now that nothing but that was interposed between me and danger, was a source of some consolation. I cast my eye towards the window. This, likewise, was a new sugges∣tion. If the door should give way, it was my sudden resolution to throw myself from the win∣dow. Its height from the ground, which was co∣vered beneath by a brick pavement, would insure my destruction; but I thought not of that.</P>
<P>When opposite to my door the footsteps ceased. Was he listening whether my fears were allayed, and my caution were asleep? Did he hope to take me by surprize? Yet, if so, why did he allow so many noisy signals to betray his approach? Pre∣sently the steps were again heard to approach the door. An hand was laid upon the lock, and the latch pulled back. Did he imagine it possible that I should fail to secure the door? A slight effort was made to push it open, as if all bolts being with∣drawn, a slight effort only was required.</P>
<P>I no sooner perceived this, than I moved swiftly towards the window. Carwin's frame might be said to be all muscle. His strength and activity had appeared, in various instances, to be prodigious. A slight exertion of his force would demolish the door. Would not that exertion be made? Too surely it would; but, at the same moment that this obstacle should yield, and he should enter the apart∣ment, my determination was formed to leap f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
the window. My senses were still bound to this object. I gazed at the door in momentary expecta∣tion that the assault would be made. The pause continued. The person without was irresolute and motionless.</P>
<P>Suddenly, it occurred to me that Carwin might conceive me to have fled. That I had not betaken myself to flight was, indeed, the least probable of all conclusions. In this persuasion he must have been confirmed on finding the lower door unfastened, and the chamber door locked. Was it not wise to foster this persuasion? Should I maintain deep silence, this, in addition to other circumstances, might encourage the belief, and he would once more depart. Every new reflection added plau∣sibility to this reasoning. It was presently more strongly enforced, when I noticed footsteps with∣drawing from the door. The blood once more flowed back to my heart, and a dawn of exultation began to rise: but my joy was short lived. In∣stead of descending the stairs, he passed to the door of the opposite chamber, opened it, and having en∣tered, shut it after him with a violence that shook the house.</P>
<P>How was I to interpret this circumstance? For what end could he have entered this chamber? Did the violence with which he closed the door testify the depth of his vexation? This room was usually occupied by Pleyel. Was Carwin aware of his absence on this night? Could he be suspected of a design so sordid as pillage? If this were his view there were no means in my power to frustrate it. It behoved me to seize the first opportunity to escape▪ but if my escape were supposed by my enemy to have been already effected, no asylum was more secure than the present. How could my passage
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
from the house be accomplished without noises that might incite him to pursue me?</P>
<P>Utterly at a loss to account for his going into Pleyel's chamber, I waited in instant expectation of hearing him come forth. All, however, was pro∣foundly still. I listened in vain for a considerable period, to catch the sound of the door when it should again be opened. There was no other avenue by which he could escape, but a door which led into the girl's chamber. Would any evil from this quarter befall the girl?</P>
<P>Hence arose a new train of apprehensions. They merely added to the turbulence and agony of my reflections. Whatever evil impended over her, I had no power to avert it. Seclusion and silence were the only means of saving myself from the perils of this fatal night. What solemn vows did I put up, that if I should once more behold the light of day, I would never trust myself again within the threshold of this dwelling!</P>
<P>Minute lingered after minute, but no token was given that Carwin had returned to the passage. What, I again asked, could detain him in this room? Was it possible that he had returned, and glided, unperceived, away? I was speedily aware of the difficulty that attended an enterprize like this; and yet, as if by that means I were capable of gaining any information on that head, I cast anxious looks from the window.</P>
<P>The object that first attracted my attention was an human figure standing on the edge of the bank. Perhaps my penetration was assisted by my hopes. Be that as it will, the figure of Carwin was clearly distinguishable. From the obscurity of my station, it was impossible that I should be discerned by him, and yet he scarcely suffered me to catch a glimpse
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
of him. He turned and went down the steep, which, in this part, was not difficult to be scaled.</P>
<P>My conjecture then had been right. Carwin was softly opened the door, descended the stairs, and issued forth. That I should not have overheard his steps, was only less incredible than that my eyes had deceived me. But what was now to be done? The house was at length delivered from this detested inmate. By one avenue might he again re-enter. Was it not wise to bar the lower door? Perhaps he had gone out by the kitchen door. For this end, he must have passed through Judith's cham∣ber. These entrances being closed and bolted, as great security was gained as was compatible with my lonely condition.</P>
<P>The propriety of these measures was too mani∣fest not to make me struggle successfully with my fears. Yet I opened my own door with the utmost caution, and descended as if I were affraid that Carwin had been still immured in Pleyel's cham∣ber. The outer door was a-jar. I shut, with trembling eagerness, and drew every bolt that ap∣pended to it. I then passed with light and less cau∣tious steps through the parlour, but was surprized to discover that the kitchen door was secure. I was compelled to acquiesce in the first conjecture that Carwin had escaped through the entry.</P>
<P>My heart was now somewhat eased of the load of apprehension. I returned once more to my chamber, the door of which I was careful to lock. It was no time to think of repose. The moon∣light began already to fade before the light of the day. The approach of morning was betokened by the usual signals. I mused upon the events of this night, and determined to take up my abode henceforth at my brother's. Whether I should in∣form
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
him of what had happened was a question which seemed to demand some consideration. My safety unquestionably required that I should aban∣don my present habitation.</P>
<P>As my thoughts began to flow with fewer im∣pediments, the image of Pleyel, and the dubious∣ness of his condition, again recurred to me. I again ran over the possible causes of his absence on the preceding day. My mind was attuned to melancholy. I dwelt, with an obstinacy for which I could not account, on the idea of his death. I painted to myself his struggles with the billows, and his last appearance. I imagined myself a mid∣night wanderer on the shore, and to have stumbled on his corpse, which the tide had cast up. These dreary images affected me even to tears. I endea∣voured not to restrain them. They imparted a re∣lief which I had not anticipated. The more co∣piously they flowed, the more did my general sen∣sations appear to subside into calm, and a certain restlessness give way to repose.</P>
<P>Perhaps, relieved by this effusion, the slumber so much wanted might have stolen on my senses, had there been no new cause of alarm.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS aroused from this stupor by sounds that evidently arose in the next chamber. Was it pos∣sible that I had been mistaken in the figure which I had seen on the bank? or had Carwin, by some inscrutable means, penetrated once more into this chamber? The opposite door opened; footsteps came forth, and the person, advancing to mine, knocked.</P>
<P>So unexpected an incident robbed me of all pre∣sence of mind, and, starting up, I involuntarily ex∣claimed, "Who is there?" An answer was im∣mediately given. The voice, to my inexpressible astonishment, was Pleyel's.</P>
<P>"It is I. Have you risen? If you have not, make haste; I want three minutes conversation with you in the parlour—I will wait for you there." Saying this he retired from the door.</P>
<P>Should I confide in the testimony of my ears? If that were true, it was Pleyel that had been hi∣therto immured in the opposite chamber: he whom my rueful fancy had depicted in so many ruinous and ghastly shapes: he whose footsteps had been listened to with such inquietude! What is man, that knowledge is so sparingly conferred upon him! that his heart should be wrung with distress, and his frame be exanimated with fear, though his safety be encompassed with impregnable walls! What are the bounds of human imbecility! He that warned me of the presence of my foe refused the intimation by which so many racking fears would have been precluded.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126"/>Yet who would have imagined the arrival of Pleyel at such an hour? His tone was desponding and anxious. Why this unseasonable summons? and why this hasty departure? Some tidings he, perhaps, bears of mysterious and unwelcome im∣port.</P>
<P>My impatience would not allow me to consume much time in deliberation: I hastened down. Pleyel I found standing at a window, with eyes cast down as in meditation, and arms folded on his breast. Every line in his countenance was pregnant with sorrow. To this was added a certain wanness and air of fatigue. The last time I had seen him ap∣pearances had been the reverse of these. I was startled at the change. The first impulse was to question him as to the cause. This impulse was sup∣planted by some degree of confusion, flowing from a consciousness that love had too large, and, as it might prove, a perceptible share in creating this im∣pulse. I was silent.</P>
<P>Presently he raised his eyes and fixed them upon me. I read in them an anguish altogether ineffa∣ble. Never had I witnessed a like demeanour in Pleyel. Never, indeed, had I observed an human countenance in which grief was more legibly in∣scribed. He seemed struggling for utterance; but his struggles being fruitless, he shook his head and turned away from me.</P>
<P>My impatience would not allow me to be longer silent: "What," said I, "for heaven's sake, my friend, what is the matter?"</P>
<P>He started at the sound of my voice. His looks, for a moment, became convulsed with an emotion very different from grief. His accents were broken with rage.</P>
<P>"The matter—O wretch!—thus exquisitely
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
fashioned—on whom nature seemed to have ex∣hausted all her graces; with charms so awful and so pure! how art thou fallen! From what height fallen! A ruin so complete—so unheard of!"</P>
<P>His words were again choaked by emotion. Grief and pity were again mingled in his features. He resumed, in a tone half suffocated by sobs:</P>
<P>"But why should I upbraid thee? Could I re∣store to thee what thou hast lost; efface this cursed stain; snatch thee from the jaws of this fiend; I would do it. Yet what will avail my efforts? I have not arms with which to contend with so con∣summate, so frightful a depravity.</P>
<P>"Evidence less than this would only have excited resentment and scorn. The wretch who should have breathed a suspicion injurious to thy honor, would have been regarded without anger; not hatred or envy could have prompted him; it would merely be an argument of madness. That my eyes, that my ears, should bear witness to thy fall! By no other way could detestible conviction be im∣parted.</P>
<P>"Why do I summon thee to this conference? Why expose myself to thy derision? Here admo∣nition and entreaty are vain. Thou knowest him already, for a murderer and thief. I had thought to have been the first to disclose to thee his infamy; to have warned thee of the pit to which thou art hastening; but thy eyes are open in vain. O foul and insupportable disgrace!</P>
<P>"There is but one path. I know you will dis∣appear together. In thy ruin, how will the felicity and honor of multitudes be involved! But it must come. This scene shall not be blotted by his pre∣sence. No doubt thou wilt shortly see thy detested paramour. This scene will be again polluted by
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
a midnight assignation. Inform him of his danger; tell him that his crimes are known; let him fly far and instantly from this spot, if he desires to avoid the fate which menaced him in Ireland.</P>
<P>"And wilt thou not stay behind?—But shame upon my weakness. I know not what I would say.—I have done what I purposed. To stay longer, to expostulate, to beseech, to enumerate the consequences of thy act—what end can it serve but to blazon thy infamy and embitter our woes? And yet, O think, think ere it be too late, on the distresses which thy flight will entail upon us; on the base, grovelling, and atrocious cha∣racter of the wretch to whom thou hast sold thy honor. But what is this? Is not thy effrontery impenetrable, and thy heart thoroughly cankered? O most specious, and most profligate of women!"</P>
<P>Saying this, he rushed out of the house. I saw him in a few moments hurrying along the path which led to my brother's. I had no power to prevent his going, or to recall, or to follow him. The accents I had heard were calculated to confound and bewilder. I looked around me to assure myself that the scene was real. I moved that I might banish the doubt that I was awake. Such enormous imputations from the mouth of Pleyel! To be stigmatized with the names of wanton and profligate! To be charged with the sacrifice of honor! with midnight meetings with a wretch known to be a murderer and thief! with an intention to fly in his company!</P>
<P>What I had heard was surely the dictate of phrenzy, or it was built upon some fatal, some in∣comprehensible mistake. After the horrors of the night; after undergoing perils so imminent from this man, to be summoned to an interview like this;
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
to find Pleyel fraught with a belief that, instead of having chosen death as a refuge from the vio∣lence of this man, I had hugged his baseness to my heart, had sacrificed for him my purity, my spotless name, my friendships, and my fortune! that even madness could engender accusations like these was not to be believed.</P>
<P>What evidence could possibly suggest concep∣tions so wild? After the unlooked-for interview with Carwin in my chamber, he retired. Could Pleyel have observed his exit? It was not long after that Pleyel himself entered. Did he build on this incident, his odious conclusions? Could the long series of my actions and sentiments grant me no exemption from suspicions so foul? Was it not more rational to infer that Carwin's designs had been illicit; that my life had been endangered by the fury of one whom, by some means, he had discovered to be an assassin and robber; that my honor had been assailed, not by blandishments, but by violence?</P>
<P>He has judged me without hearing. He has drawn from dubious appearance, conclusions the most improbable and unjust. He has loaded me with all outrageous epithets. He has ranked me with prostitutes and thieves. I cannot pardon thee, Pleyel, for this injustice. Thy understanding must be hurt. If it be not, if thy conduct was sober and deliberate, I can never forgive an outrage so unmanly, and so gross.</P>
<P>These thoughts gradually gave place to others. Pleyel was possessed by some momentary phrenzy: appearances had led him into palpable errors. Whence could his sagacity have contracted this blindness? Was it not love? Previously assured of my affection for Carwin, distracted with grief and
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
jealousy, and impelled hither at that late hour by some unknown instigation, his imagination trans∣formed shadows into monsters, and plunged him into these deplorable errors.</P>
<P>This idea was not unattended with consolation. My soul was divided between indignation at his in∣justice, and delight on account of the source from which I conceived it to spring. For a long time they would allow admission to no other thoughts. Surprize is an emotion that enfeebles, not invigo∣rates. All my meditations were accompanied with wonder. I rambled with vagueness, or clung to one image with an obstinacy which sufficiently tes∣tified the maddening influence of late transactions.</P>
<P>Gradually I proceeded to reflect upon the con∣sequences of Pleyel's mistake, and on the measures I should take to guard myself against future injury from Carwin. Should I suffer this mistake to be detected by time? When his passion should sub∣side, would he not perceive the flagrancy of his in∣justice, and hasten to atone for it? Did it not be∣come my character to testify resentiment for lan∣guage and treatment so opprobrious? Wrapt up in the consciousness of innocence, and confiding in the influence of time and reflection to confute so groundless a charge, it was my province to be pas∣sive and silent.</P>
<P>As to the violences meditated by Carwin, and the means of eluding them, the path to be taken by me was obvious. I resolved to tell the tale to my brother, and regulate myself by his advice. For this end, when the morning was somewhat advanc∣ed, I took the way to his house. My sister was engaged in her customary occupations. As soon as I appeared, she remarked a change in my looks. I was not willing to alarm her by the information
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
which I had to communicate. Her health was in that condition which rendered a disastrous tale par∣ticularly unsuitable. I forbore a direct answer to her inquiries, and inquired, in my turn, for Wie∣land.</P>
<P>"Why," said she, "I suspect something mys∣terious and unpleasant has happened this morning. Scarcely had we risen when Pleyel dropped among us. What could have prompted him to make us so early and so unseasonable a visit I cannot tell. To judge from the disorder of his dress, and his countenance, something of an extraordinary nature has occurred. He permitted me merely to know that he had slept none, nor even undressed, during the past night. He took your brother to walk with him. Some topic must have deeply engaged them, for Wieland did not return till the breakfast hour was passed, and returned alone. His disturbance was excessive; but he would not listen to my im∣portunities, or tell me what had happened. I ga∣thered from hints which he let fall, that your situ∣ation was, in some way, the cause: yet he assured me that you were at your own house, alive, in good health, and in perfect safety. He scarcely ate a morsel, and immediately after breakfast went out again. He would not inform me whither he was going, but mentioned that he probably might not return before night."</P>
<P>I was equally astonished and alarmed by this in∣formation. Pleyel had told his tale to my brother, and had, by a plausible and exaggerated picture, instilled into him unfavorable thoughts of me. Yet would not the more correct judgment of Wieland perceive and expose the fallacy of his conclusions? Perhaps his uneasiness might arise from some in∣sight into the character of Carwin, and from ap∣prehensions
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
for my safety. The appearances by which Pleyel had been misled, might induce him likewise to believe that I entertained an indiscreet, though not dishonorable affection for Carwin. Such were the conjectures rapidly formed. I was inexpressibly anxious to change them into certain∣ty. For this end an interview with my brother was desirable. He was gone, no one knew whither, and was not expected speedily to return. I had no clue by which to trace his footsteps.</P>
<P>My anxieties could not be concealed from my sister. They heightened her solicitude to be ac∣quainted with the cause. There were many rea∣sons persuading me to silence: at least, till I had seen my brother, it would be an act of inexcusable temerity to unfold what had lately passed. No other expedient for eluding her importunities oc∣curred to me, but that or returning to my own house. I recollected my determination to become a tenant of this roof. I mentioned it to her. She joyfully acceded to this proposal, and suffered me, with less reluctance, to depart, when I told her that it was with a view to collect and send to my new dwelling what articles would be immediately useful to me.</P>
<P>Once more I returned to the house which had been the scene of so much turbulence and danger. I was at no great distance from it when I observed my brother coming out. On seeing me he stopped, and after ascertaining, as it seemed, which way I was going, he returned into the house before me. I sincerely rejoiced at this event, and I hastened to set things, if possible, on their right footing.</P>
<P>His brow was by no means expressive of those vehement emotions with which Pleyel had been agitated. I drew a favorable omen from this cir∣cumstance.
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
Without delay I began the conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>"I have been to look for you," said I, "but was told by Catharine that Pleyel had engaged you on some important and disagreeable affair. Before his interview with you he spent a few minutes with me. These minutes he employed in upbraiding me for crimes and intentions with which I am by no means chargeable. I believe him to have taken up his opinions on very insufficient grounds. His be∣haviour was in the highest degree precipitate and unjust, and, until I receive some atonement, I shall treat him, in my turn, with that contempt which he justly merits: meanwhile I am fearful that he has prejudiced my brother against me. That is an evil which I most anxiously deprecate, and which I shall indeed exert myself to remove. Has he made me the subject of this morning's conversation?"</P>
<P>My brother's countenance testified no surprize at my address. The benignity of his looks were no wise diminished.</P>
<P>"It is true;" said he, "your conduct was the subject of our discourse. I am your friend, as well as your brother. There is no human being whom I love with more tenderness, and whose welfare is nearer my heart. Judge then with what emotions I listened to Pleyel's story. I expect and desire you to vindicate yourself from aspersions so foul, if vindication be possible."</P>
<P>The tone with which he uttered the last words affected me deeply. "If vindication be possible!" repeated I. "From what you know, do you deem a formal vindication necessary? Can you harbour for a moment the belief of my guilt?"</P>
<P>He shook his head with an air of acute anguish. "I have struggled," said he, "to dismiss that be∣lief.
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
You speak before a judge who will profit by any pretence to acquit you: who is ready to ques∣tion his own senses when they plead against you."</P>
<P>These words incited a new set of thoughts in my mind. I began to suspect that Pleyel had built his accusations on some foundation unknown to me. "I may be a stranger to the grounds of your belief. Pleyel loaded me with indecent and virulent in∣vectives, but he withheld from me the facts that generated his suspicions. Events took place last night of which some of the circumstances were of an ambiguous nature. I conceived that these might possibly have fallen under his cognizance, and that, viewed through the mists of prejudice and passion, they supplied a pretence for his conduct, but be∣lieved that your more unbiassed judgment would estimate them at their just value. Perhaps his tale has been different from what I suspect it to be. Listen then to my narrative. If there be any thing in his story inconsistent with mine, his story is false."</P>
<P>I then proceeded to a circumstantial relation of the incidents of the last night. Wieland listened with deep attention. Having finished, "This," continued I, "is the truth; you see in what cir∣cumstances an interview took place between Car∣win and me. He remained for hours in my closet, and for some minutes in my chamber. He de∣parted without haste or interruption. If Pleyel marked him as he left the house, and it is not im∣possible that he did, inferences injurious to my character might suggest themselves to him. In ad∣mitting them, he gave proofs of less discernment and less candor than I once ascribed to him."</P>
<P>"His proofs," said Wieland, after a consider∣able pause, "are different. That he should be
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
deceived, is not possible. That he himself is not the deceiver, could not be believed, if his testimony were not inconsistent with yours; but the doubts which I entertained are now removed. Your tale, some parts of it, is marvellous; the voice which exclaimed against your rashness in approaching the closet, your persisting notwithstanding that prohi∣bition, your belief that I was the ruffian, and your subsequent conduct, are believed by me, because I have known you from childhood, because a thou∣sand instances have attested your veracity, and be∣cause nothing less than my own hearing and vision would convince me, in opposition to her own asser∣tions, that my sister had fallen into wickedness like this."</P>
<P>I threw my arms around him, and bathed his cheek with my tears. "That," said I, "is spoken like my brother. But what are the proofs?"</P>
<P>He replied—"Pleyel informed me that, in going to your house, his attention was attracted by two voices. The persons speaking sat beneath the bank out of sight. These persons, judging by their voices, were Carwin and you. I will not repeat the dialogue. If my sister was the female, Pleyel was justified in concluding you to be, indeed, one of the most profligate of women. Hence, his accu∣sations of you, and his efforts to obtain my con∣currence to a plan by which an eternal separation should be brought about between my sister and this man."</P>
<P>I made Wieland repeat this recital. Here, in∣deed, was a tale to fill me with terrible foreboding. I had vainly thought that my safety could be suffi∣ciently secured by doors and bars, but this is a foe from whose grasp no power of divinity can save me! His artifices will ever lay my fame and hap∣piness
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
at his mercy. How shall I counterwork his plots, or detect his coadjutor? He has taught some vile and abandoned female to mimic my voice. Pleyel's ears were the witnesses of my dis∣honor. This is the midnight assignation to which he alluded. Thus is the silence he maintained when attempting to open the door of my chamber, ac∣counted for. He supposed me absent, and meant, perhaps, had my apartment been accessible, to leave in it some accusing memorial.</P>
<P>Pleyel was no longer equally culpable. The sicerity of his anguish, the depth of his despair. I remembered with some tendencies to gratitude. Yet was he not precipitate? Was the conjecture that my part was played by some mimic so utterly un∣tenable? Instances of this faculty are common. The wickedness of Carwin must, in his opinion, have been adequate to such contrivances, and yet the supposition of my guilt was adopted in prefer∣ence to that.</P>
<P>But how was this error to be unveiled? What but my own assertion had I to throw in the balance against it? Would this be permitted to out∣weigh the testimony of his senses? I had no wit∣nesses to prove my existence in another place. The real events of that night are marvellous. Few, to whom they should be related, would scruple to discredit them. Pleyel is sceptical in a transcend∣ant degree. I cannot summon Carwin to my bar, and make him the attestor of my innocence, and the accuser of himself.</P>
<P>My brother saw and comprehended my distress. He was unacquainted, however, with the full ex∣tent of it. He knew not by how many motives I was incited to retrieve the good opinion of Pleyel. He endeavored to console me. Some new event,
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
he said, would occur to disentangle the maze. He did not question the influence of my eloquence, if I thought proper to exert it. Why not seek an in∣terview with Pleyel, and exact from him a minute relation, in which something may be met with serv∣ing to destroy the probability of the whole?</P>
<P>I caught, with eagerness, at this hope; but my alacrity was damped by new reflections. Should I, perfect in this respect, and unblemished as I was, thrust myself, uncalled, into his presence, and make my felicity depend upon his arbitrary verdict?</P>
<P>"If you chuse to seek an interview," continued Wieland, "you must make haste, for Pleyel in∣formed me of his intention to set out this evening or to-morrow on a long journey."</P>
<P>No intelligence was less expected or less wel∣come than this. I had thrown myself in a window seat; but now, starting on my feet, I exclaimed, "Good heavens! what is it you say? a journey? whither? when?"</P>
<P>"I cannot say whither. It is a sudden resolution I believe. I did not hear of it till this morning. He promises to write to me as soon as he is settled."</P>
<P>I needed no further information as to the cause and issue of this journey. The scheme of happi∣ness to which he had devoted his thoughts was blasted by the discovery of last night. My prefer∣ence of another, and my unworthiness to be any longer the object of his adoration, were evinced by the same act and in the same moment. The thought of utter desertion, a desertion originating in such a cause, was the prelude to distraction. That Pleyel should abandon me forever, because I was blind to his excellence, because I coveted pollution, and wedded infamy, when, on the con∣trary, my heart was the shrine of all purity, and
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
beat only for his sake, was a destiny which, as long as my life was in my own hands, I would by no means consent to endure.</P>
<P>I remembered that this evil was still preventable; that this fatal journey it was still in my power to procrastinate, or, perhaps, to occasion it to be laid aside. There were no impediments to a visit: I only dreaded lest the interview should be too long delayed. My brother befriended my impatience, and readily consented to furnish me with a chaise and servant to attend me. My purpose was to go immediately to Pleyel's farm, where his engage∣ments usually detained him during the day.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>MY way lay through the city. I had scarcely entered it when I was seized with a general sensa∣tion of sickness. Every object grew dim and swam before my sight. It was with difficulty I prevented myself from sinking to the bottom of the carriage. I ordered myself to be carried to Mrs. Baynton's, in hope that an interval of repose would invigo∣rate and refresh me. My distracted thoughts would allow me but little rest. Growing somewhat bet∣ter in the afternoon, I resumed my journey.</P>
<P>My contemplations were limited to a few objects. I regarded my success, in the purpose which I had in view, as considerably doubtful. I depended, in some degree, on the suggestions of the moment, and on the materials which Pleyel himself should furnish me. When I reflected on the nature of the accusation, I burned with disdain. Would not truth, and the consciousness of innocence, render me triumphant? Should I not cast from me, with irresistible force, such atrocious imputations?</P>
<P>What an entire and mournful change has been effected in a few hours! The gulf that separates man from insects is not wider than that which se∣vers the polluted from the chaste among women. Yesterday and to-day I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. There is a degree of depravity to which it is impossible for me to sink; yet, in the apprehension of another, my ancient and intimate associate, the perpetual wit∣ness of my actions, and partaker of my thoughts,
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
I had ceased to be the same. My integrity was tar∣nished and withered in his eyes. I was the col∣league of a murderer, and the paramour of a thief!</P>
<P>His opinion was not destitute of evidence: yet what proofs could reasonably avail to establish an opinion like this? If the sentiments corresponded not with the voice that was heard, the evidence was deficient; but this want of correspondence would have been supposed by me if I had been the auditor and Pleyel the criminal. But mimicry might still more plausibly have been employed to explain the scene. Alas! it is the fate of Clara Wieland to fall into the hands of a precipitate and inexorable judge.</P>
<P>But what, O man of mischief! is the tendency of thy thoughts? Frustrated in thy first design, thou wilt not forego the immolation of thy victim. To exterminate my reputation was all that remain∣ed to thee, and this my guardian has permitted. To dispossess Pleyel of this prejudice may be im∣possible; but if that be effected, it cannot be sup∣posed that thy wiles are exhausted; thy cunning will discover innumerable avenues to the accom∣plishment of thy malignant purpose.</P>
<P>Why should I enter the lists against thee? Would to heaven I could disarm thy vengeance by my de∣precations! When I think of all the resources with which nature and education have supplied thee; that thy form is a combination of steely fibres and organs of exquisite ductility and boundless com∣pass, actuated by an intelligence gifted with infinite endowments, and comprehending all knowledge, I perceive that my doom is fixed. What obstacle will be able to divert thy zeal or repel thy efforts? That being who has hitherto protected me has borne testimony to the formidableness of thy at∣tempts,
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
since nothing less than supernatural inter∣ference could check thy career.</P>
<P>Musing on these thoughts, I arrived, towards the close of the day, at Pleyel's house. A month be∣fore, I had traversed the same path; but how dif∣ferent were my sensations! Now I was seeking the presence of one who regarded me as the most degenerate of human kind. I was to plead the cause of my innocence, against witnesses the most explicit and unerring, of those which support the fabric of human knowledge. The nearer I ap∣proached the crisis, the more did my confidence de∣cay. When the chaise stopped at the door, my strength refused to support me, and I threw myself into the arms of an ancient female domestic. I had not courage to inquire whether her master was at home. I was tormented with fears that the pro∣jected journey was already undertaken. These sears were removed, by her asking me whether she should call her young master, who had just gone into his own room. I was somewhat revived by this intelligence, and resolved immediately to seek him there.</P>
<P>In my confusion of mind, I neglected to knock at the door, but entered his apartment without previous notice. This abruptness was altogether involuntary. Absorbed in reflections of such un∣speakable moment, I had no leisure to heed the niceties of punctilio. I discovered him standing with his back towards the entrance. A small trunk, with its lid raised, was before him, in which it seemed as if he had been busy in packing his clothes. The moment of my entrance, he was employed in gazing at something which he held in his hand.</P>
<P>I imagined that I fully comprehended this scene. The image which he held before him, and by which
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
his attention was so deeply engaged, I doubted not to be my own. These preparations for his jour∣ney, the cause to which it was to be imputed, the hopelessness of success in the undertaking on which I had entered, rushed at once upon my feelings, and dissolved me into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>Startled by this sound, he dropped the lid of the trunk and turned. The solemn sadness that pre∣viously overspread his countenance, gave sudden way to an attitude and look of the most vehement astonishment. Perceiving me unable to uphold my∣self, he stepped towards me without speaking, and supported me by his arm. The kindness of this action called forth a new effusion from my eyes. Weeping was a solace to which, at that time, I had not grown familiar, and which, therefore, was pe∣culiarly delicious. Indignation was no longer to be read in the features of my friend. They were pregnant with a mixture of wonder and pity. Their expression was easily interpreted. This visit, and these tears, were tokens of my penitence. The wretch whom he had stigmatized as incurably and obdurately wicked, now shewed herself susceptible of remorse, and had come to confess her guilt.</P>
<P>This persuasion had no tendency to comfort me. It only shewed me, with new evidence, the difficulty of the task which I had assigned myself. We were mutually silent. I had less power and less inclination than ever to speak. I extricated myself from his hold, and threw myself on a sofa. He placed himself by my side, and appeared to wait with impatience and anxiety for some beginning of the conversation. What could I say? If my mind had suggested any thing suitable to the occasion, my utterance was suffocated by tears.</P>
<P>Frequently he attempted to speak, but seemed de∣terred
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
by some degree of uncertainty as to the true nature of the scene. At length, in faltering ac∣cents he spoke:</P>
<P>"My friend! would to heaven I were still per∣mitted to call you by that name. The image that I once adored existed only in my fancy; but though I cannot hope to see it realized, you may not be totally insensible to the horrors of that gulf into which you are about to plunge. What heart is forever exempt from the goadings of compunction and the influx of laudable propensities?</P>
<P>"I thought you accomplished and wise beyond the rest of women. Not a sentiment you uttered, not a look you assumed, that were not, in my ap∣prehension, fraught with the sublimities of recti∣tude and the illuminations of genius. Deceit has some bounds. Your education could not be without influence. A vigorous understanding cannot be ut∣terly devoid of virtue; but you could not counter∣feit the powers of invention and reasoning. I was rash in my invectives. I will not, but with life, relinquish all hopes of you. I will shut out every proof that would tell me that your heart is incura∣bly diseased.</P>
<P>"You come to restore me once more to happi∣ness; to convince me that you have torn her mask from vice, and feel nothing but abhorrence for the part you have hitherto acted."</P>
<P>At these words my equanimity forsook me. For a moment I forgot the evidence from which Pleyel's opinions were derived, the benevolence of his re∣monstrances, and the grief which his accents be∣spoke; I was filled with indignation and horror at charges so black; I shrunk back and darted at him a look of disdain and anger. My passion supplied me with words.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144"/>"What detestable infatuation was it that led me hither! Why do I patiently endure these horrible insults! My offences exist only in your own dis∣tempered imagination: you are leagued with the traitor who assailed my life: you have vowed the destruction of my peace and honor. I deserve in∣famy for listening to calumnies so base!"</P>
<P>These words were heard by Pleyel without visi∣ble resentment. His countenance relapsed into its former gloom; but he did not even look at me. The ideas which had given place to my angry emotions returned, and once more melted me into tears. "O!" I exclaimed, in a voice broken by sobs, "what a task is mine! Compelled to hear∣ken to charges which I feel to be false, but which I know to be believed by him that utters them; believed too not without evidence, which, though fallacious, is not unplausible.</P>
<P>"I came hither not to confess, but to vindicate. I know the source of your opinions. Wieland has informed me on what your suspicions are built. These suspicions are softered by you as certainties; the tenor of my life, of all my conversations and letters, affords me no security; every sentiment that my tongue and my pen have uttered, bear testimony to the rectitude of my mind; but this testimony is rejected. I am condemned as brutally profligate: I am classed with the stupidly and sordidly wicked.</P>
<P>"And where are the proofs that must justify so foul and so improbable an accusation? You have overheard a midnight conference. Voices have sa∣luted your ear, in which you imagine yourself to have recognized mine, and that of a detected vil∣lain. The sentiments expressed were not allowed to outweigh the casual or concerted resemblance of voice. Sentiments the reverse of all those whose
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
influence my former life had attested, denoting a mind polluted by grovelling vices, and entering into compact with that of a thief and a murderer. The nature of these sentiments did not enable you to detect the cheat, did not suggest to you the possibi∣lity that my voice had been counterfeited by ano∣ther.</P>
<P>"You were precipitate and prone to condemn. Instead of rushing on the impostors, and comparing the evidence of sight with that of hearing, you stood aloof, or you fled. My innocence would not now have stood in need of vindication, if this conduct had been pursued. That you did not pur∣sue it, your present thoughts incontestibly prove. Yet this conduct might surely have been expected from Pleyel. That he would not hastily impute the blackest of crimes, that he would not couple my name with infamy, and cover me with ruin for inadequate or slight reasons, might reasonably have been expected." The fobs which convulsed my bosom would not suffer me to proceed.</P>
<P>Pleyel was for a moment affected. He looked at me with some expression of doubt; but this quickly gave place to a mournful solemnity. He fixed his eyes on the floor as in reverie, and spoke:</P>
<P>"Two hours hence I am gone. Shall I carry away with me the sorrow that is now my guest? or shall that sorrow be accumulated tenfold? What is she that is now before me? Shall every hour supply me with new proofs of a wickedness beyond example? Already I deem her the most abandoned and detestable of human creatures. Her coming and her tears imparted a gleam of hope, but that gleam has vanished."</P>
<P>He now fixed his eyes upon me, and every muscle in his face trembled. His tone was hollow
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
and terrible—"Thou knowest that I was a witness of your interview, yet thou comest hither to up∣braid me for injustice! Thou canst look me in the face and say that I am deceived!—An inscruta∣ble providence has fashioned thee for some end. Thou wilt live, no doubt, to fulfil the purposes of thy maker, if he repent not of his workman∣ship, and send not his vengeance to exterminate thee, ere the measure of thy days be full. Surely nothing in the shape of man can vie with thee!</P>
<P>"But I thought I had stifled this fury. I am not constituted thy judge. My office is to pity and amend, and not to punish and revile. I deemed my∣self exempt from all tempestuous passions. I had almost persuaded myself to weep over thy fall; but I am frail as dust, and mutable as water; I am calm, I am compassionate only in thy absence.— Make this house, this room, thy abode as long as thou wilt, but forgive me if I prefer solitude for the short time during which I shall stay." Saying this he motioned as if to leave the apartment.</P>
<P>The stormy passions of this man affected me by sympathy. I ceased to weep. I was motionle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and speechless with agony. I sat with my han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> clasped, mutely gazing after him as he withdrew I desired to detain him, but was unable to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> any effort for that purpose, till he had passed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the room. I then uttered an involuntary an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> piercing cry—"Pleyel! Art thou gone? Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> forever?"</P>
<P>At this summons he hastily returned. He behe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me wild, pale, gasping for breath, and my head a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ready sinking on my bosom. A painful dizzine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> seized me, and I fainted away.</P>
<P>When I recovered, I found myself stretched o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a bed in the outer apartment, and Pleyel, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
female servants standing beside it. All the fury and scorn which the countenance of the former lately expressed, had now disappeared, and was succeeded by the most tender anxiety. As soon as he per∣ceived that my senses were returned to me, he clasped his hands, and exclaimed, "God be thanked! you are once more alive. I had almost despaired of your recovery. I fear I have been precipitate and unjust. My senses must have been the victims of some inexplicable and momentary phrenzy. For∣give me, I beseech you, forgive my reproaches. I would purchase conviction of your purity, at the price of my existence here and hereafter."</P>
<P>He once more in a tone of the most fervent tenderness, besought me to be composed, and then left me to the care of the women.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>HERE was wrought a surprizing change in my friend. What was it that had shaken conviction so firm? Had any thing occurred during my fit, adequate to produce so total an alteration? My attendants informed me that he had not left my apartment; that the unusual duration of my fit, and the failure, for a time, of all the means used for my recovery, had filled him with grief and dismay. Did he regard the effect which his reproaches had pro∣duced as a proof of my sincerity?</P>
<P>In this state of mind, I little regarded my languors of body. I rose and requested an interview with him before my departure, on which I was resolved, notwithstanding his earnest solicitation to spend the night at his house. He complied with my request. The tenderness which he had lately betrayed, had now disappeared, and he once more relapsed into a chilling solemnity.</P>
<P>I told him that I was preparing to return to my brother's; that I had come hither to vindicate my innocence from the foul aspersions which he had cast upon it. My pride had not taken refuge in silence or distance. I had not relied upon time, or the suggestions of his cooler thoughts, to confute his charges. Conscious as I was that I was perfectly guiltless, and entertaining some value for his good opinion, I could not prevail upon myself to be∣lieve that my efforts to make my innocence mani∣fest, would be fruitless. Adverse appearances might
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
be numerous and specious, but they were unques∣tionably false. I was willing to believe him sin∣cere, that he made no charges which he himself did not believe; but these charges were destitute of truth. The grounds of his opinion were fallacious; and I desired an opportunity of detecting their fal∣lacy. I entreated him to be explicit, and to give me a detail of what he had heard, and what he had seen.</P>
<P>At these words, my companion's countenance grew darker. He appeared to be struggling with his rage. He opened his lips to speak, but his ac∣cents died away ere they were formed. This con∣flict lasted for some minutes, but his fortitude was finally successful. He spoke as follows:</P>
<P>"I would fain put an end to this hateful scene: what I shall say, will be breath idly and unpro∣fitably consumed. The clearest narrative will add nothing to your present knowledge. You are ac∣quainted with the grounds of my opinion, and yet you avow yourself innocent: Why then should I rehearse these grounds? You are apprized of the character of Carwin: Why then should I enume∣rate the discoveries which I have made respecting him? Yet, since it is your request; since, consider∣ing the limitedness of human faculties, some error may possibly lurk in those appearances which I have witnessed, I will briefly relate what I know.</P>
<P>"Need I dwell upon the impressions which your conversation and deportment originally made upon me? We parted in childhood; but our intercourse, by letter, was copious and uninterrupted. How fondly did I anticipate a meeting with one whom her letters had previously taught me to consider as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he first of women, and how fully realized were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he expectations that I had formed!</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="150"/>"Here, said I, is a being, after whom sages may model their transcendent intelligence, and painters, their ideal beauty. Here is exemplified, that union between intellect and form, which has hitherto existed only in the conceptions of the poet. I have watched your eyes; my attention has hung upon your lips. I have questioned whether the enchantments of your voice were more conspicuous in the intricacies of melody, or the emphasis of rhetoric. I have marked the transitions of your discourse, the felicities of your expression, your refined argumentation, and glowing imagery; and been forced to acknowledge, that all delights were meagre and contemptible, compared with those con∣nected with the audience and sight of you. I have contemplated your principles, and been astonished at the solidity of their foundation, and the perfection of their structure. I have traced you to your home. I have viewed you in relation to your servants, to your family, to your neighbours, and to the world. I have seen by what skilful arrangements you facili∣tate the performance of the most arduous and com∣plicated duties; what daily accessions of strength your judicious discipline bestowed upon your me∣mory; what correctness and abundance of know∣ledge was daily experienced by your unwearied ap∣plication to books, and to writing. It she that possesses so much in the bloom of youth, will go on accumulating her stores, what, said I, is the picture she will display at a mature age?</P>
<P>"You know not the accuracy of my observation. I was desirous that others should profit by an ex∣ample so rare. I therefore noted down, in writing, every particular of your conduct. I was anxious to benefit by an opportunity so seldom afforded us. I laboured not to omit the slightest shade, or the
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
most petty line in your portrait. Here there was no other task incumbent on me but to copy; there was no need to exaggerate or overlook, in order to produce a more unexceptionable pattern. Here was a combination of harmonies and graces, inca∣pable of diminution or accession without injury to its completeness.</P>
<P>"I found no end and no bounds to my task. No display of a scene like this could be chargeable with redundancy or superfluity. Even the colour of a shoe, the knot of a ribband, or your attitude in plucking a rose, were of moment to be recorded. Even the arrangements of your breakfast-table and your toilet have been amply displayed.</P>
<P>"I know that mankind are more easily enticed to virtue by example than by precept. I know that the absoluteness of a model, when supplied by in∣vention, diminishes its salutary influence, since it is useless, we think, to strive after that which we know to be beyond our reach. But the picture which I drew was not a phantom; as a model, it was de∣void of imperfection; and to aspire to that height which had been really attained, was by no means unreasonable. I had another and more interesting object in view. One existed who claimed all my tenderness. Here, in all its parts, was a model worthy of assiduous study, and indefatigable imita∣tion. I called upon her, as she wished to secure and enhance my esteem, to mould her thoughts, her words, her countenance, her actions, by this pattern.</P>
<P>"The task was exuberant of pleasure, and I was deeply engaged in it, when an imp of mischief was let loose in the form of Carwin. I admired his powers and accomplishments. I did not wonder that they were admired by you. On the rectitude of your judgment, however, I relied to keep this
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
admiration within discreet and scrupulous bounds. I assured myself, that the strangeness of his deport∣ment, and the obscurity of his life, would teach you caution. Of all errors, my knowledge of your character informed me that this was least likely to befall you.</P>
<P>"You were powerfully affected by his first ap∣pearance; you were bewitched by his countenance and his tones; your description was ardent and pa∣thetic: I listened to you with some emotions of sur∣prize. The portrait you drew in his absence, and the intensity with which you mused upon it, were new and unexpected incidents. They bespoke a sensibility somewhat too vivid; but from which, while subjected to the guidance of an understand∣ing like yours, there was nothing to dread.</P>
<P>"A more direct intercourse took place between you. I need not apologize for the solicitude which I entertained for your safety. He that gifted me with perception of excellence, compelled me to love it. In the midst of danger and pain, my contem∣plations have ever been cheered by your image. Every object in competition with you, was worth∣less and trivial. No price was too great by which your safety could be purchased. For that end, the sacrifice of ease, of health, and even of life, would cheerfully have been made by me. What wonder then, that I scrutinized the sentiments and deport∣ment of this man with ceaseless vigilance; that I watched your words and your looks when he was present; and that I extracted cause for the deepest inquietudes, from every token which you gave of having put your happiness into this man's keeping"</P>
<P>"I was cautious in deciding. I recalled the va∣rious conversations in which the topics of love and marriage had been discussed. As a woman, young,
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
beautiful, and independent, it behoved you to have fortified your mind with just principles on this sub∣ject. Your principles were eminently just. Had not their rectitude and their firmness been attested by your treatment of that specious seducer Dash∣wood? These principles, I was prone to believe, exempted you from danger in this new state of things. I was not the last to pay my homage to the unrivalled capacity, insinuation, and eloquence of this man. I have disguised, but could never stifle the conviction, that his eyes and voice had a witch∣craft in them, which rendered him truly formidable: but I reflected on the ambiguous expression of his countenance—an ambiguity which you were the first to remark; on the cloud which obscured his character; and on the suspicious nature of that con∣cealment which he studied; and concluded you to be safe. I denied the obvious construction to ap∣pearances. I referred your conduct to some prin∣ciple which had not been hitherto disclosed, but which was reconcileable with those already known.</P>
<P>"I was not suffered to remain long in this sus∣pence. One evening, you may recollect, I came to your house, where it was my purpose, as usual, to lodge, somewhat earlier than ordinary. I spied a light in your chamber as I approached from the outside, and on inquiring of Judith, was informed that you were writing. As your kinsman and friend, and fellow-lodger, I thought I had a right to be familiar. You were in your chamber, but your employment and the time were such as to make it no infraction of decorum to follow you thither. The spirit of mischievous gaiety possessed me. I proceeded on tiptoe. You did not perceive my en∣trance; and I advanced softly till I was able to overlook your shoulder.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154"/>"I had gone thus far in error, and had no power to recede. How cautiously should we guard against the first inroads of temptation! I knew that to pry into your papers was criminal; but I reflected that no sentiment of yours was of a nature which made it your interest to conceal it. You wrote much more than you permitted your friends to peruse. My curiosity was strong, and I had only to throw a glance upon the paper, to secure its gratification. I should never have deliberately committed an act like this. The slightest obstacle would have re∣pelled me; but my eye glanced almost spontane∣ously upon the paper. I caught only parts of sen∣tences; but my eyes comprehended more at a glance, because the characters were short-hand. I lighted on the words <HI>summer-house, midnight,</HI> and made out a passage which spoke of the propriety and of the effects to be expected from <HI>another</HI> interview. All this passed in less than a moment. I then checked myself, and made myself known to you, by a tap upon your shoulder.</P>
<P>"I could pardon and account for some trifling alarm; but your trepidation and blushes were ex∣cessive. You hurried the paper out of sight, and seemed too anxious to discover whether I knew the contents to allow yourself to make any inquiries. I wondered at these appearances of consternation, but did not reason on them until I had retired. When alone, these incidents suggested themselves to my reflections anew.</P>
<P>"To what scene, or what interview, I asked, did you allude? Your disappearance on a former evening, my tracing you to the recess in the bank, your silence on my first and second call, your vague answers and invincible embarrassment, when you, at length, ascended the hill, I recollected with new
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
surprize. Could this be the summer-house alluded to? A certain timidity and consciousness had gene∣rally attended you, when this incident and this re∣cess had been the subjects of conversation. Nay, I imagined that the last time that adventure was mentioned, which happened in the presence of Car∣win, the countenance of the latter betrayed some emotion. Could the interview have been with him?</P>
<P>"This was an idea calculated to rouse every faculty to contemplation. An interview at that hour, in this darksome retreat, with a man of this mysterious but formidable character; a clandestine interview, and one which you afterwards endea∣voured with so much solicitude to conceal! It was a fearful and portentous occurrence. I could not measure his power, or fathom his designs. Had he rifled from you the secret of your love, and recon∣ciled you to concealment and nocturnal meetings? I scarcely ever spent a night of more inquietude.</P>
<P>"I knew not how to act. The ascertainment of this man's character and views seemed to be, in the first place, necessary. Had he openly pre∣ferred his suit to you, we should have been impow∣ered to make direct inquiries; but since he had chosen this obscure path, it seemed reasonable to infer that his character was exceptionable. It, at least, subjected us to the necessity of resorting to other means of information. Yet the improbabi∣lity that you should commit a deed of such rash∣ness, made me reflect anew upon the insufficiency of those grounds on which my suspicions had been built, and almost to condemn myself for harbour∣ing them.</P>
<P>"Though it was mere conjecture that the in∣terview spoken of had taken place with Carwin,
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
yet two ideas occurred to involve me in the most painful doubts. This man's reasonings might be so specious, and his artifices so profound, that, aided by the passion which you had conceived for him, he had finally succeeded; or his situation might be such as to justify the secrecy which you maintained. In neither case did my wildest reveries suggest to me, that your honor had been forfeited.</P>
<P>"I could not talk with you on this subject. If the imputation was false, its atrociousness would have justly drawn upon me your resentment, and I must have explained by what facts it had been sug∣gested. If it were true, no benefit would follow from the mention of it. You had chosen to con∣ceal it for some reasons, and whether these reasons were true or false, it was proper to discover and remove them in the first place. Finally, I acqui∣esced in the least painful supposition, trammelled as it was with perplexities, that Carwin was upright, and that, if the reasons of your silence were known, they would be found to be just.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>"THREE days have elapsed since this occur∣rence. I have been haunted by perpetual inquie∣tude. To bring myself to regard Carwin without terror, and to acquiesce in the belief of your safety, was impossible. Yet to put an end to my doubts, seemed to be impracticable. If some light could be reflected on the actual situation of this man, a direct path would present itself. If he were, con∣trary to the tenor of his conversation, cunning and malignant, to apprize you of this, would be to place you in security. If he were merely unfor∣tunate and innocent, most readily would I espouse his cause; and if his intentions were upright with regard to you, most eagerly would I sanctify your choice by my approbation.</P>
<P>"It would be vain to call upon Carwin for an avowal of his deeds. It was better to know no∣thing, than to be deceived by an artful tale. What he was unwilling to communicate, and this unwil∣lingness had been repeatedly manifested, could never be extorted from him. Importunity might be ap∣peased, or imposture effected by fallacious repre∣sentations. To the rest of the world he was un∣known. I had often made him the subject of dis∣course; but a glimpse of his figure in the street was the sum of their knowledge who knew most. None had ever seen him before, and received as new, the information which my intercourse with him in Valencia, and my present intercourse, enabled me to give.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158"/>"Wieland was your brother. If he had really made you the object of his courtship, was not a brother authorized to interfere and demand from him the confession of his views? Yet what were the grounds on which I had reared this supposition? Would they justify a measure like this? Surely not.</P>
<P>"In the course of my restless meditations, it occurred to me, at length, that my duty required me to speak to you, to confess the indecorum of which I had been guilty, and to state the reflections to which it had led me. I was prompted by no mean or selfish views. The heart within my breast was not more precious than your safety: most cheerfully would I have interposed my life between you and danger. Would you cherish resentment at my conduct? When acquainted with the mo∣tive which produced it, it would not only exempt me from censure, but entitle me to gratitude.</P>
<P>"Yesterday had been selected for the rehearsal of the newly-imported tragedy. I promised to be present. The state of my thoughts but little qua∣lified me for a performer or auditor in such a scene; but I reflected that, after it was finished, I should return home with you, and should then enjoy an opportunity of discoursing with you fully on this topic. My resolution was not formed without a remnant of doubt, as to its propriety. When I left this house to perform the visit I had promised, my mind was full of apprehension and despondency. The dubiousness of the event of our conversation, fear that my interference was too late to secure your peace, and the uncertainty to which hope gave birth, whether I had not erred in believing you devoted to this man, or, at least, in imagining that he had obtained your consent to midnight conferences, dis∣tracted
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
me with contradictory opinions, and repug∣nant emotions.</P>
<P>"I can assign no reason for calling at Mrs. Baynton's. I had seen her in the morning, and knew her to be well. The concerted hour had nearly arrived, and yet I turned up the street which leads to her house, and dismounted at her door. I entered the parlour and threw myself in a chair. I saw and inquired for no one. My whole frame was overpowered by dreary and comfortless sensa∣tions. One idea possessed me wholly; the inex∣pressible importance of unveiling the designs and character of Carwin, and the utter improba∣bility that this ever would be effected. Some in∣stinct induced me to lay my hand upon a news∣paper. I had perused all the general intelligence it contained in the morning, and at the same spot. The act was rather mechanical than voluntary.</P>
<P>"I threw a languid glance at the first column that presented itself. The first words which I read, began with the offer of a reward of three hundred guineas for the apprehension of a convict under sentence of death, who had escaped from Newgate prison in Dublin. Good heaven! how every fibre of my frame tingled when I proceeded to read that the name of the criminal was Francis Carwin!</P>
<P>"The descriptions of his person and address were minute. His stature, hair, complexion, the extraordinary position and arrangement of his fea∣tures, his aukward and disproportionate form, his gesture and gait, corresponded perfectly with those of our mysterious visitant. He had been found guil∣ty in two indictments. One for the murder of the Lady Jane Conway, and the other for a robbery com∣mitted on the person of the honorable Mr. Ludloe.</P>
<P>"I repeatedly perused this passage. The ideas
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
which flowed in upon my mind, affected me like an instant transition from death to life. The pur∣pose dearest to my heart was thus effected, at a time and by means the least of all others within the scope of my foresight. But what purpose? Car∣win was detected. Acts of the blackest and most sordid guilt had been committed by him. Here was evidence which imparted to my understanding the most luminous certainty. The name, visage, and deportment, were the same. Between the time of his escape, and his appearance among us, there was a sufficient agreement. Such was the man with whom I suspected you to maintain a clandes∣tine correspondence. Should I not haste to snatch you from the talons of this vulture? Should I see you rushing to the verge of a dizzy precipice, and not stretch forth a hand to pull you back? I had no need to deliberate. I thrust the paper in my pocket, and resolved to obtain an immediate con∣ference with you. For a time, no other image made its way to my understanding. At length, it occurred to me, that though the information I pos∣sessed was, in one sense, sufficient, yet if more could be obtained, more was desirable. This pas∣sage was copied from a British paper; part of it only, perhaps, was transcribed. The printer was in possession of the original.</P>
<P>"Towards his house I immediately turned my horse's head. He produced the paper, but I found nothing more than had already been seen. While busy in perusing it, the printer stood by my side. He noticed the object of which I was in search. "Aye," said he, "that is a strange affair. I should never have met with it, had not Mr. Hallet sent to me the paper, with a particular request to re∣publish that advertisement."</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161"/>"Mr. Hallet! What reasons could he have for making this request? Had the paper sent to him been accompanied by any information respecting the convict? Had he personal or extraordinary reasons for desiring its republication? This was to be known only in one way. I speeded to his house. In answer to my interrogations, he told me that Ludloe had formerly been in America, and that during his residence in this city, considerable intercourse had taken place between them. Hence a confidence arose, which has since been kept alive by occasional letters. He had lately received a letter from him, enclosing the newspaper from which this extract had been made. He put in into my hands, and pointed out the passages which re∣lated to Carwin.</P>
<P>"Ludloe confirms the facts of his conviction and escape; and adds, that he had reason to believe him to have embarked for America. He describes him in general terms, as the most incomprehen∣sible and formidable among men; as engaged in schemes, reasonably suspected to be, in the highest degree, criminal, but such as no human intelligence is able to unravel: that his ends are pursued by means which leave it in doubt whether he be not in league with some internal spirit: that his crimes have hitherto been perpetrated with the aid of some unknown but desperate accomplices: that he wages a perpetual war against the happiness of mankind, and sets his engines of destruction at work against every object that presents itself.</P>
<P>"This is the substance of the letter. Hallet expressed some surprize at the curiosity which was manifested by me on this occasion. I was too much absorbed by the ideas suggested by this letter, to pay attention to his remarks. I shuddered with the

apprehension of the evil to which our indiscreet familiarity with this man had probably exposed us. I burnt with impatience to see you, and to do what in me lay to avert the calamity which threatened us. It was already five o'clock. Night was has∣tening, and there was no time to be lost. On leaving Mr. Hallet's house, who should meet me in the street, but Bertrand, the servant whom I left in Germany. His appearance and accoutrements be∣spoke him to have just alighted from a toilsome and long journey. I was not wholly without expecta∣tion of seeing him about this time, but no one was then more distant from my thoughts. You know what reasons I have for anxiety respecting scenes with which this man was conversant. Carwin was for a moment forgotten. In answer to my vehement inquiries, Bertrand produced a copious packet. I shall not at present mention its contents, nor the measures which they obliged me to adopt. I be∣stowed a brief perusal on these papers, and having given some directions to Bertrand, resumed my pur∣pose with regard to you. My horse I was obliged to resign to my servant, he being charged with a commission that required speed. The clock had struck ten, and Mettingen was five miles distant. I was to journey thither on foot. These circum∣stances only added to my expedition.</P>
<P>"As I passed swiftly along, I reviewed all the incidents accompanying the appearance and deport∣ment of that man among us. Late events have been inexplicable and mysterious beyond any of which I have either read or heard. These events were coeval with Carwin's introduction. I am unable to explain their origin and mutual depend∣ance; but I do not, on that account, believe them to have a supernatural original. Is not this man
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
the agent? Some of them seem to be propitious; but what should I think of those threats of assassina∣tion with which you were lately alarmed? Blood∣shed is the trade, and horror is the element of this man. The process by which the sympathies of nature are extinguished in our hearts, by which evil is made our good, and by which we are made susceptible of no activity but in the infliction, and no joy but in the spectacle of woes, is an obvious process. As to an alliance with evil geniuses, the power and the malice of daemons have been a thou∣sand times exemplified in human beings. There are no devils but those which are begotten upon selfish∣ness, and reared by cunning.</P>
<P>"Now, indeed, the scene was changed. It was not his secret poniard that I dreaded. It was only the success of his efforts to make you a confederate in your own destruction, to make your will the instrument by which he might bereave you of liberty and honor.</P>
<P>"I took, as usual, the path through your bro∣ther's ground. I ranged with celerity and silence along the bank. I approached the fence, which divides Wieland's estate from yours. The recess in the bank being near this line, it being necessary for me to pass near it, my mind being tainted with inveterate suspicions concerning you; suspicions which were indebted for their strength to incidents connected with this spot; what wonder that it seized upon my thoughts!</P>
<P>"I leaped on the fence; but before I descended on the opposite side, I paused to survey the scene. Leaves dropping with dew, and glistening in the moon's rays, with no moving object to molest the deep repose, filled me with security and hope. I left the station at length, and tended forward. You
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
were probably at rest. How should I communi∣cate without alarming you, the intelligence of my arrival? An immediate interview was to be pro∣cured. I could not bear to think that a minute should be lost by remissness or hesitation. Should I knock at the door? or should I stand under your chamber windows, which I perceived to be open, and awaken you by my calls?</P>
<P>"These reflections employed me, as I passed opposite to the summer-house. I had scarcely gone by, when my ear caught a sound unusual at this time and place. It was almost too faint and too transient to allow me a distinct perception of it. I stopped to listen; presently it was heard again, and now it was somewhat in a louder key. It was laughter; and unquestionably produced by a female voice. That voice was familiar to my senses. It was yours.</P>
<P>"Whence it came, I was at first at a loss to conjecture; but this uncertainty vanished when it was heard the third time. I threw back my eyes towards the recess. Every other organ and limb was useless to me. I did not reason on the subject. I did not, in a direct manner, draw my conclusions from the hour, the place, the hilarity which this sound betokened, and the circumstance of having a companion, which it no less incontestably proved. In an instant, as it were, my heart was invaded with cold, and the pulses of life at a stand.</P>
<P>"Why should I go further? Why should I return? Should I not hurry to a distance from a sound, which, though formerly so sweet and delect∣able, was now more hideous than the shrieks of owls?</P>
<P>"I had no time to yield to this impulse. The thought of approaching and listening occurred to
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
me. I had no doubt of which I was conscious. Yet my certainty was capable of increase. I was likewise stimulated by a sentiment that partook of rage. I was governed by an half-formed and tem∣pestuous resolution to break in upon your inter∣view, and strike you dead with my upbraiding.</P>
<P>"I approached with the utmost caution. When I reached the edge of the bank immediately above the summer-house, I thought I heard voices from below, as busy in conversation. The steps in the rock are clear of bushy impediments. They al∣lowed me to descend into a cavity beside the build∣ing without being detected. Thus to lie in wait could only be justified by the momentousness of the occasion."</P>
<P>Here Pleyel paused in his narrative, and fixed his eyes upon me. Situated as I was, my horror and astonishment at this tale gave way to compas∣sion for the anguish which the countenance of my friend betrayed. I reflected on his force of under∣standing. I reflected on the powers of my enemy. I could easily divine the substance of the conversa∣tion that was overheard. Carwin had constructed his plot in a manner suited to the characters of those whom he had selected for his victims. I saw that the convictions of Pleyel were immutable. I for∣bore to struggle against the storm, because I saw that all struggles would be fruitless. I was calm; but my calmness was the torpor of despair, and not the tranquillity of fortitude. It was calmness in∣vincible by any thing that his grief and his fury could suggest to Pleyel. He resumed—</P>
<P>"Woman! wilt thou hear me further? Shall I go on to repeat the conversation? Is it shame that makes thee tongue-tied? Shall I go on? or art thou satisfied with what has been already said?"</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"/>I bowed my head. "Go on," said I. "I make not this request in the hope of undeceiving you. I shall no longer contend with my own weakness. The storm is let loose, and I shall peaceably submit to be driven by its fury. But go on. This con∣ference will end only with affording me a clearer foresight of my destiny; but that will be some sa∣tisfaction, and I will not part without it."</P>
<P>Why, on hearing these words, did Pleyel hesi∣tate? Did some unlooked-for doubt insinuate itself into his mind? Was his belief suddenly shaken by my looks, or my words, or by some newly recol∣lected circumstance? Whencesoever it arose, it could not endure the test of deliberation. In a few minutes the flame of resentment was again lighted up in his bosom. He proceeded with his accus∣tomed vehemence—</P>
<P>"I hate myself for this folly. I can find no apology for this tale. Yet I am irresistibly im∣pelled to relate it. She that hears me is apprized of every particular. I have only to repeat to her her own words. She will listen with a tranquil air, and the spectacle of her obduracy will drive me to some desperate act. Why then should I persist! yet persist I must."</P>
<P>Again he paused. "No," said he, "it is im∣possible to repeat your avowals of love, your ap∣peals to former confessions of your tenderness, to former deeds of dishonor, to the circumstances of the first interview that took place between you. It was on that night when I traced you to this re∣cess. Thither had he enticed you, and there had you ratified an unhallowed compact by admitting him—</P>
<P>"Great God! Thou witnessedst the agonies that tore my bosom at that moment! Thou wit∣nessedst
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
my efforts to repel the testimony of my ears! It was in vain that you dwelt upon the con∣fusion which my unlooked-for summons excited in you: the tardiness with which a suitable excuse occurred to you; your resentment that my imper∣tinent intrusion had put an end to that charming interview: A disappointment for which you endea∣voured to compensate yourself, by the frequency and duration of subsequent meetings.</P>
<P>"In vain you dwelt upon incidents of which you only could be conscious; incidents that oc∣curred on occasions on which none beside your own family were witnesses. In vain was your discourse characterized by peculiarities inimitable of sentiment and language. My conviction was effected only by an accumulation of the same to∣kens. I yielded not but to evidence which took away the power to withhold my faith.</P>
<P>"My sight was of no use to me. Beneath so thick an umbrage, the darkness was intense. Hear∣ing was the only avenue to information, which the circumstances allowed to be open. I was couched within three feet of you. Why should I approach nearer? I could not contend with your betrayer. What could be the purpose of a contest? You stood in no need of a protector. What could I do, but retire from the spot overwhelmed with con∣fusion and dismay? I sought my chamber, and en∣deavoured to regain my composure. The door of the house, which I found open, your subsequent entrance, closing, and fastening it, and going into your chamber, which had been thus long deserted, were only confirmations of the truth.</P>
<P>"Why should I paint the tempestuous fluctua∣tion of my thoughts between grief and revenge, be∣tween rage and despair? Why should I repeat my
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
vows of eternal implacability and persecution, and the speedy recantation of these vows?</P>
<P>"I have said enough. You have dismissed me from a place in your esteem. What I think, and what I feel, is of no importance in your eyes. May the duty which I owe myself enable me to forget your existence. In a few minutes I go hence. Be the maker of your fortune, and may adversity instruct you in that wisdom, which edu∣cation was unable to impart to you."</P>
<P>Those were the last words which Pleyel uttered. He left the room, and my new emotions enabled me to witness his departure without any apparent loss of composure. As I sat alone, I ruminated on these incidents. Nothing was more evident than that I had taken an eternal leave of happiness. Life was a worthless thing, separate from that good which had now been wrested from me; yet the sen∣timent that now possessed me had no tendency to palsy my exertions, and overbear my strength. I noticed that the light was declining, and perceived the propriety of leaving this house. I placed my∣self again in the chaise, and returned slowly towards the city.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I reached the city it was dusk. It was my purpose to spend the night at Mettingen. I was not solicitous, as long as I was attended by a faithful servant, to be there at an early hour My exhausted strength required me to take some refresh∣ment. With this view, and in order to pay respect to one whose affection for me was truly maternal, I stopped at Mrs. Baynton's. She was absent from home; but I had scarcely entered the house when one of her domestics presented me a letter. I open∣ed and read as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To Clara Wieland,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>What shall I say to extenuate the misconduct of last night? It is my duty to repair it to the utmost of my power, but the only way in which it can be repaired, you will not, I fear, be prevailed on to adopt. It is by granting me an interview, at your own house, at eleven o'clock this night. I have no means of removing any fears that you may entertain of my designs, but my simple and solemn declarations. These, after what has passed between us, you may deem unworthy of confidence. I cannot help it. My folly and rashness has left me no other resource. I will be at your door by that hour. If you chuse to admit me to a conference, provided that conference has no witnesses, I will dis∣close to you particulars, the knowledge of which is of the utmost importance to your happiness. Farewell.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>CARWIN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170"/>What a letter was this! A man known to be an assassin and robber; one capable of plotting against my life and my fame; detected lurking in my chamber, and avowing designs the most flagitious and dreadful, now solicits me to grant him a mid∣night interview! To admit him alone into my pre∣sence! Could he make this request with the ex∣pectation of my compliance? What had he seen in me, that could justify him in admitting so wild a belief? Yet this request is preferred with the utmost gravity. It is not accompanied by an appearance of uncommon earnestness. Had the misconduct to which he alludes been a flight incivility, and the interview requested to take place in the midst of my friends, there would have been no extrava∣gance in the tenor of this letter; but, as it was, the writer had surely been bereft of his reason.</P>
<P>I perused this epistle frequently. The request it contained might be called audacious or stupid, if it had been made by a different person; but from Carwin, who could not be unaware of the effect which it must naturally produce, and of the manner in which it would unavoidably be treated, it was perfectly inexplicable. He must have counted on the success of some plot, in order to extort my assent. None of those motives by which I am usually governed would ever have persuaded me to meet any one of his sex, at the time and place which he had prescribed. Much less would I con∣sent to a meeting with a man, tainted with the most detestable crimes, and by whose arts my own safety had been so imminently endangered, and my hap∣piness irretrievably destroyed. I shuddered at the idea that such a meeting was possible. I felt some reluctance to approach a spot which he still visited and haunted.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171"/>Such were the ideas which first suggested them∣selves on the perusal of the letter. Meanwhile, I resumed my journey. My thoughts still dwelt upon the same topic. Gradually from ruminating on this epistle, I reverted to my interview with Pleyel. I recalled the particulars of the dialogue to which he had been an auditor. My heart sunk anew on viewing the inextricable complexity of this decep∣tion, and the inauspicious concurrence of events, which tended to confirm him in his error. When he approached my chamber door, my terror kept me mute. He put his ear, perhaps, to the crevice, but it caught the sound of nothing human. Had I called, or made any token that denoted some one to be within, words would have ensued; and as omni∣presence was impossible, this discovery, and the art∣less narrative of what had just passed, would have saved me from his murderous invectives. He went into his chamber, and after some interval, I stole across the entry and down the stairs, with inaudible steps. Having secured the outer doors, I returned with less circumspection. He heard me not when I descended; but my returning steps were easily distin∣guished. Now he thought was the guilty inter∣view at an end. In what other way was it possible for him to construe these signals?</P>
<P>How fallacious and precipitate was my decision! Carwin's plot owed its success to a coincidence of events scarcely credible. The balance was swayed from its equipoise by a hair. Had I even begun the conversation with an account of what befel me in my chamber, my previous interview with Wie∣land would have taught him to suspect me of im∣posture; yet, if I were discoursing with this ruffian, when Pleyel touched the lock of my chamber door, and when he shut his own door with so much vio∣lence,
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
how, he might ask, should I be able to relate these incidents? Perhaps he had withheld the knowledge of these circumstances from my brother, from whom, therefore, I could not obtain it, so that my innocence would have thus been irresistibly de∣monstrated.</P>
<P>The first impulse which flowed from these ideas was to return upon my steps, and demand once more an interview; but he was gone: his parting declarations were remembered.</P>
<P>Pleyel, I exclaimed, thou art gone for ever! Are thy mistakes beyond the reach of detection? Am I helpless in the midst of this snare? The plotter is at hand. He even speaks in the style of peni∣tence. He solicits an interview which he promises shall end in the disclosure of something momentous to my happiness. What can he say which will avail to turn aside this evil? But why should his remorse be feigned? I have done him no injury. His wickedness is fertile only of despair; and the billows of remorse will some time overbear him▪ Why may not this event have already taken place? Why should I refuse to see him?</P>
<P>This idea was present, as it were, for a moment. I suddenly recoiled from it, confounded at that frenzy which could give even momentary harbour to such a scheme; yet presently it returned. A length I even conceived it to deserve deliberation▪ I questioned whether it was not proper to admit, at a lonely spot, in a sacred hour, this man of tremen∣dous and inscrutable attributes, this performer o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> horrid deeds, and whose presence was predicted to call down unheard-of and unutterable horrors.</P>
<P>What was it that swayed me? I felt myself di¦vested of the power to will contrary to the motive that determined me to seek his presence. My mind
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
seemed to be split into separate parts, and these parts to have entered into furious and implacable con∣tention. These tumults gradually subsided. The reasons why I should confide in that interposi∣tion which had hitherto defended me; in those tokens of compunction which this letter contained; in the efficacy of this interview to restore its spot∣lessness to my character, and banish all illusions from the mind of my friend, continually acquired new evidence and new strength.</P>
<P>What should I fear in his presence? This was unlike an artifice intended to betray me into his hands. If it were an artifice, what purpose would it serve? The freedom of my mind was untouch∣ed, and that freedom would defy the assaults of blandishments or magic. Force was I not able to repel. On the former occasion my courage, it is true, had failed at the imminent approach of danger; but then I had not enjoyed opportunities of deliberation; I had foreseen nothing; I was sunk into imbecility by my previous thoughts; I had been the victim of recent disappointments and an∣ticipated ills: Witness my infatuation in opening the closet in opposition to divine injunctions.</P>
<P>Now, perhaps, my courage was the offspring of a no less erring principle. Pleyel was for ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost to me. I strove in vain to assume his person, and suppress my resentment; I strove in vain to be∣lieve in the assuaging influence of time, to look forward to the birth-day of new hopes, and the re∣exaltation of that luminary, of whose effulgencies I had so long and so liberally partaken.</P>
<P>What had I to suffer worse than was already inflicted?</P>
<P>Was not Carwin my foe? I owed my untimely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his treason. Instead of flying from his pre∣sence,
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
ought I not to devote all my faculties to the gaining of an interview, and compel him to repair the ills of which he has been the author? Why should I suppose him impregnable to argument? Have I not reason on my side, and the power of imparting conviction? Cannot he be made to see the justice of unravelling the maze in which Pleyel is bewildered?</P>
<P>He may, at least, be accessible to fear. Has he nothing to fear from the rage of an injured woman? But suppose him inaccessible to such inducements; suppose him to persist in all his flagitious pur∣poses; are not the means of defence and resistance in my power?</P>
<P>In the progress of such thoughts, was the resolu∣tion at last formed. I hoped that the interview was sought by him for a laudable end; but, be that as it would, I trusted that, by energy of reasoning or of action, I should render it auspicious, or, at least, harmless.</P>
<P>Such a determination must unavoidably fluctuate. The poet's chaos was no unapt emblem of the state of my mind. A torment was awakened in my bosom, which I foresaw would end only when this interview was past, and its consequences fully ex∣perienced. Hence my impatience for the arrival of the hour which had been prescribed by Carwin.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, my meditations were tumultuously active. New impediments to the execution of the scheme were speedily suggested. I had apprized Catharine of my intention to spend this and many future nights with her. Her husband was informed of this arrangement, and had zealously approved it. Eleven o'clock exceeded their hour of retiring. What excuse should I form for changing my plan? Should I shew this letter to Wieland, and submit
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
myself to his direction? But I knew in what way he would decide. He would servently dissuade me from going. Nay, would he not do more? He was apprized of the offences of Carwin, and of the reward offered for his apprehension. Would he not seize this opportunity of executing justice on a criminal?</P>
<P>This idea was new. I was plunged once more into doubt. Did not equity enjoin me thus to fa∣cilitate his arrest? No. I disdained the office of betrayer. Carwin was unapprized of his danger, and his intentions were possibly beneficent. Should I station guards about the house, and make an act, intended perhaps for my benefit, instrumental to his own destruction? Wieland might be justified in thus employing the knowledge which I should impart, but I, by imparting it, should pollute myself with more hateful crimes than those undeservedly imputed to me. This scheme, therefore, I unhe∣sitatingly rejected. The views with which I should return to my own house, it would therefore be ne∣cessary to conceal. Yet some pretext must be in∣vented. I had never been initiated into the trade of lying. Yet what but falshood was a deliberate suppression of the truth? To deceive by silence or by words is the same.</P>
<P>Yet what would a lie avail me? What pretext would justify this change in my plan? Would it not tend to confirm the imputations of Pleyel? That I should voluntarily return to an house in which honor and life had so lately been endanger∣ed, could be explained in no way favorable to my integrity.</P>
<P>These reflections, if they did not change, at least suspended my decision. In this state of uncertainty I alighted at the <HI>hut.</HI> We gave this name to the
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
house tenanted by the farmer and his servants, and which was situated on the verge of my brother's ground, and at a considerable distance from the man∣sion. The path to the mansion was planted by a double row of walnuts. Along this path I pro∣ceeded alone. I entered the parlour, in which was a light just expiring in the socket. There was no one in the room. I perceived by the clock that stood against the wall, that it was near eleven. The lateness of the hour startled me. What had be∣come of the family? They were usually retired an hour before this; but the unextinguished taper, and the unbarred door were indications that they had not retired. I again returned to the hall, and passed from one room to another, but still encoun∣tered not a human being.</P>
<P>I imagined that, perhaps, the lapse of a few mi∣nutes would explain these appearances. Mean∣while I reflected that the preconcerted hour had arrived. Carwin was perhaps waiting my approach. Should I immediately retire to my own house, no one would be apprized of my proceeding. Nay, the interview might pass, and I be enabled to return in half an hour. Hence no necessity would arise for dissimulation.</P>
<P>I was so far influenced by these views that I rose to execute this design; but again the unusual con∣dition of the house occurred to me, and some vague solicitude as to the condition of the family. I was nearly certain that my brother had not retired; but by what motives he could be induced to desert his house thus unseasonably, I could by no means divine. Louisa Conway, at least, was at home, and had, probably, retired to her chamber; perhaps she was able to impart the information I wanted.</P>
<P>I went to her chamber, and found her asleep.
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
She was delighted and surprized at my arrival, and told me with how much impatience and anxiety my brother and his wife had waited my coming. They were fearful that some mishap had befallen me, and had remained up longer than the usual period. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, Catharine would not resign the hope of seeing me. Louisa said she had left them both in the parlour, and she knew of no cause for their absence.</P>
<P>As yet I was not without solicitude on account of their personal safety. I was far from being per∣fectly at ease on that head, but entertained no dis∣tinct conception of the danger that impended over them. Perhaps to beguile the moments of my long protracted stay, they had gone to walk upon the bank. The atmosphere, though illuminated only by the star-light, was remarkably serene. Mean∣while the desireableness of an interview with Car∣win again returned, and I finally resolved to seek it.</P>
<P>I passed with doubting and hasty steps along the path. My dwelling, seen at a distance, was gloomy and desolate. It had no inhabitant, for my servant, in consequence of my new arrangement, had gone to Mettingen. The temerity of this attempt began to shew itself in more vivid colours to my under∣standing. Whoever has pointed steel is not with∣out arms; yet what must have been the state of my mind when I could meditate, without shuddering, on the use of a murderous weapon, and believe my∣self secure merely because I was capable of being made so by the death of another? Yet this was not my state. I felt as if I was rushing into deadly toils, without the power of pausing or receding.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as I arrived in sight of the front of the house, my attention was excited by a light from the window of my own chamber. No appearance could be less explicable. A meeting was expected with Carwin, but that he pre-occupied my cham∣ber, and had supplied himself with light, was not to be believed. What motive could influence him to adopt this conduct? Could I proceed until this was explained? Perhaps, if I should proceed to a distance in front, some one would be visible. A sidelong but feeble beam from the window, fell upon the piny copse which skirted the bank. As I eyed it, it suddenly became mutable, and after flitting to and fro, for a short time, it vanished. I turned my eye again toward the window, and perceived that the light was still there; but the change which I had noticed was occasioned by a change in the position of the lamp or candle within. Hence, that some person was there was an unavoidable inference.</P>
<P>I paused to deliberate on the propriety of ad∣vancing. Might I not advance cautiously, and, therefore, without danger? Might I not knock at the door, or call, and be apprized of the nature of my visitant before I entered? I approached and listened at the door, but could hear nothing. I knocked at first timidly, but afterwards with loud∣ness. My signals were unnoticed. I stepped back and looked, but the light was no longer discernible.
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
Was it suddenly extinguished by a human agent? What purpose but concealment was intended? Why was the illumination produced, to be thus suddenly brought to an end? And why, since some one was there, had silence been observed?</P>
<P>These were questions, the solution of which may be readily supposed to be entangled with danger. Would not this danger, when measured by a wo∣man's fears, expand into gigantic dimensions? Menaces of death; the stunning exertions of a warning voice; the known and unknown attributes of Carwin; our recent interview in this chamber; the pre-appointment of a meeting at this place and hour, all thronged into my memory. What was to be done?</P>
<P>Courage is no definite or stedfast principle. Let that man who shall purpose to assign motives to the actions of another, blush at his folly and forbear. Not more presumptuous would it be to attempt the classification of all nature, and the scanning of su∣preme intelligence. I gazed for a minute at the window, and fixed my eyes, for a second minute, on the ground. I drew forth from my pocket, and opened, a penknife. This, said I, be my safe-guard and avenger. The assailant shall perish, or myself shall fall.</P>
<P>I had locked up the house in the morning, but had the key of the kitchen door in my pocket. I, there∣fore, determined to gain access behind. Thither I hastened, unlocked and entered. All was lonely, darksome, and waste. Familiar as I was with every part of my dwelling, I easily found my way to a closet, drew forth a taper, a flint, tinder, and steel, and, in a moment as it were, gave myself the gui∣dance and protection of light.</P>
<P>What purpose did I meditate? Should I explore
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
my way to my chamber, and confront the being who had dared to intrude into this recess, and had laboured for concealment? By putting out the light did he seek to hide himself, or mean only to cir∣cumvent my incautious steps? Yet was it not more probable that he desired my absence by thus encou∣raging the supposition that the house was unoccu∣pied? I would see this man in spite of all impedi∣ments; ere I died, I would see his face, and summon him to penitence and retribution; no matter at what cost an interview was purchased. Reputation and life might be wrested from me by another, but my rectitude and honor were in my own keeping, and were safe.</P>
<P>I proceeded to the foot of the stairs. At such a crisis my thoughts may be supposed at no liberty to range; yet vague images rushed into my mind, of the mysterious interposition which had been ex∣perienced on the last night. My case, at present, was not dissimilar; and, if my angel were not weary of fruitless exertions to save, might not a new warning be expected? Who could say whe∣ther his silence were ascribable to the absence of danger, or to his own absence?</P>
<P>In this state of mind, no wonder that a shivering cold crept through my veins; that my pause was prolonged; and, that a fearful glance was thrown backward.</P>
<P>Alas! my heart droops, and my fingers are ener∣vated; my ideas are vivid, but my language is faint; now know I what it is to entertain incommunica∣ble sentiments. The chain of subsequent incidents is drawn through my mind, and being linked with those which forewent, by turns rouse up agonies and sink me into hopelessness.</P>
<P>Yet I will persist to the end. My narrative may
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
be invaded by inaccuracy and confusion; but if I live no longer, I will, at least, live to complete it. What but ambiguities, abruptnesses, and dark tran∣sitions, can be expected from the historian who is, at the same time, the sufferer of these disasters?</P>
<P>I have said that I cast a look behind. Some ob∣ject was expected to be seen, or why should I have gazed in that direction? Two senses were at once assailed. The same piercing exclamation of <HI>hold! hold!</HI> was uttered within the same distance of my ear. This it was that I heard. The airy undu∣lation, and the shock given to my nerves, were real. Whether the spectacle which I beheld existed in my fancy or without, might be doubted.</P>
<P>I had not closed the door of the apartment I had just left. The stair-case, at the foot of which I stood, was eight or ten feet from the door, and at∣tached to the wall through which the door led. My view, therefore, was sidelong, and took in no part of the room.</P>
<P>Through this aperture was an head thrust and drawn back with so much swiftness, that the imme∣diate conviction was, that thus much of a form, ordinarily invisible, had been unshrowded. The face was turned towards me. Every muscle was tense; the forehead and brows were drawn into vehement expression; the lips were stretched as in the act of shrieking, and the eyes emitted sparks, which, no doubt, if I had been unattended by a light, would have illuminated like the corruscations of a meteor. The sound and the vision were pre∣sent, and departed together at the same instant; but the cry was blown into my ear, while the face was many paces distant.</P>
<P>This face was well suited to a being whose per∣formances exceeded the standard of humanity, and
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
yet its features were akin to those I had before seen. The image of Carwin was blended in a thousand ways with the stream of my thoughts. This visage was, perhaps, pourtrayed by my fancy. If so, it will excite no surprize that some of his lineaments were now discovered. Yet affinities were few and unconspicuous, and were lost amidst the blaze of opposite qualities.</P>
<P>What conclusion could I form? Be the face human or not, the intimation was imparted from above. Experience had evinced the benignity of that being who gave it. Once he had interposed to shield me from harm, and subsequent events de∣monstrated the usefulness of that interposition. Now was I again warned to forbear. I was hurry∣ing to the verge of the same gulf, and the same power was exerted to recall my steps. Was it pos∣sible for me not to obey? Was I capable of hold∣ing on in the same perilous career? Yes. Even of this I was capable!</P>
<P>The intimation was imperfect: it gave no form to my danger, and prescribed no limits to my cau∣tion. I had formerly neglected it, and yet escaped. Might I not trust to the same issue? This idea might possess, though imperceptibly, some influence. I persisted; but it was not merely on this account. I cannot delineate the motives that led me on. I now speak as if no remnant of doubt existed in my mind as to the supernal origin of these sounds; but this is owing to the imperfection of my language, for I only mean that the belief was more perma∣nent, and visited more frequently my sober medita∣tions than its opposite. The immediate effects served only to undermine the foundations of my judgment and precipitate my resolutions.</P>
<P>I must either advance or return. I chose the
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
former, and began to ascend the stairs. The silence underwent no second interruption. My chamber door was closed, but unlocked, and, aided by ve∣hement efforts of my courage, I opened and look∣ed in.</P>
<P>No hideous or uncommon object was discernible. The danger, indeed, might easily have lurked out of sight, have sprung upon me as I entered, and have rent me with his iron talons; but I was blind to this fate, and advanced, though cautiously, into the room.</P>
<P>Still every thing wore its accustomed aspect. Neither lamp nor candle was to be found. Now, for the first time, suspicions were suggested as to the nature of the light which I had seen. Was it possible to have been the companion of that super∣natural visage; a meteorous refulgence producible at the will of him to whom that visage belonged, and partaking of the nature of that which accom∣panied my father's death?</P>
<P>The closet was near, and I remembered the com∣plicated horrors of which it had been productive. Here, perhaps, was inclosed the source of my peril, and the gratification of my curiosity. Should I adventure once more to explore its recesses? This was a resolution not easily formed. I was sus∣pended in thought: when glancing my eye on a table, I perceived a written paper. Carwin's hand was instantly recognized, and snatching up the pa∣per, I read as follows:—</P>
<P>"There was folly in expecting your compliance with my invitation. Judge how I was disappoint∣ed, in finding another in your place. I have wait∣ed, but to wait any longer would be perilous. I shall still seek an interview, but it must be at a dif∣ferent time and place: meanwhile, I will write this
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
—How will you bear—How inexplicable will be this transaction!—An event so unexpected—a sight so horrible!"</P>
<P>Such was this abrupt and unsatisfactory script. The ink was yet moist, the hand was that of Car∣win. Hence it was to be inferred that he had this moment left the apartment, or was still in it. I looked back, on the sudden expectation of seeing him behind me.</P>
<P>What other did he mean? What transaction had taken place adverse to my expectations? What sight was about to be exhibited? I looked around me once more, but saw nothing which indi∣cated strangeness. Again I remembered the closet, and was resolved to seek in that the solution of these mysteries. Here, perhaps, was inclosed the scene destined to awaken my horrors and baffle my foresight.</P>
<P>I have already said, that the entrance into this closet was beside my bed, which, on two sides, was closely shrowded by curtains. On that side nearest the closet, the curtain was raised. As I passed along I cast my eye thither. I started, and looked again. I bore a light in my hand, and brought it nearer my eyes, in order to dispel any illusive mists that might have hovered before them. Once more I fixed my eyes upon the bed, in hope that this more stedfast scrutiny would annihilate the object which before seemed to be there.</P>
<P>This then was the sight which Carwin had pre∣dicted! This was the event which my understand∣ing was to find inexplicable! This was the fate which had been reserved for me, but which, by some untoward chance, had befallen on another!</P>
<P>I had not been terrified by empty menaces. Vio∣lation and death awaited my entrance into this
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
chamber. Some inscrutable chance had led <HI>her</HI> hither before me, and the merciless fangs of which I was designed to be the prey, had mistaken their victim, and had fixed themselves in <HI>her</HI> heart. But where was my safety? Was the mischief exhausted or flown? The steps of the assassin had just been here; they could not be far off; in a moment he would rush into my presence, and I should perish under the same polluting and suffocating grasp!</P>
<P>My frame shook, and my knees were unable to support me. I gazed alternately at the closet door and at the door of my room. At one of these avenues would enter the exterminator of my honor and my life. I was prepared for defence; but now that danger was imminent, my means of defence, and my power to use them were gone. I was not qualified, by education and experience, to encoun∣ter perils like these: or, perhaps, I was powerless because I was again assaulted by surprize, and had not fortified my mind by foresight and previous re∣flection against a scene like this.</P>
<P>Fears for my own safety again yielded place to reflections on the scene before me. I fixed my eyes upon her countenance. My sister's well-known and beloved features could not be concealed by convulsion or lividness. What direful illusion led thee hither? Bereft of thee, what hold on happi∣ness remains to thy offspring and thy spouse? To lose thee by a common fate would have been suffi∣ciently hard; but thus suddenly to perish—to be∣come the prey of this ghastly death! How will a spectacle like this be endured by Wieland? To die beneath his grasp would not satisfy thy enemy. This was mercy to the evils which he previously made thee suffer! After these evils death was a boon which thou besoughtest him to grant. He
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
entertained no enmity against thee: I was the ob∣ject of his treason; but by some tremendous mis∣take his fury was misplaced. But how comest thou hither? and where was Wieland in thy hour of distress?</P>
<P>I approached the corpse: I lifted the still flexible hand, and kissed the lips which were breatless. Her flowing drapery was discomposed. I restored it to order, and seating myself on the bed, again fixed stedfast eyes upon her countenance. I can∣not distinctly recollect the ruminations of that mo∣ment. I saw confusedly, but forcibly, that every hope was extinguished with the life of <HI>Catharine.</HI> All happiness and dignity must henceforth be ba∣nished from the house and name of Wieland: all that remained was to linger out in agonies a short existence; and leave to the world a monument of blasted hopes and changeable fortune. Pleyel was already lost to me; yet, while Catharine lived life was not a detestable possession: but now, severed from the companion of my infancy, the partaker of all my thoughts, my cares, and my wishes, I was like one set afloat upon a stormy sea, and hanging his safety upon a plank; night was clos∣ing upon him, and an unexpected surge had torn him from his hold and overwhelmed him forever.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD no inclination nor power to move from this spot. For more than an hour, my faculties and limbs seemed to be deprived of all activity. The door below creaked on its hinges, and steps ascended the stairs. My wandering and confused thoughts were instantly recalled by these sounds, and dropping the curtain of the bed, I moved to a part of the room where any one who entered should be visible; such are the vibrations of sen∣timent, that notwithstanding the seeming fulfil∣ment of my fears, and increase of my danger, I was conscious, on this occasion, to no turbulence but that of curiosity.</P>
<P>At length he entered the apartment, and I re∣cognized my brother. It was the same Wieland whom I had ever seen. Yet his features were pervaded by a new expression. I supposed him unacquainted with the fate of his wife, and his ap∣pearance confirmed this persuasion. A brow ex∣panding into exultation I had hitherto never seen in him, yet such a brow did he now wear. Not only was he unapprized of the disaster that had hap∣pened, but some joyous occurrence had betided. What a reverse was preparing to annihilate his tran∣sitory bliss! No husband ever doated more fondly, for no wife ever claimed so boundless a devotion. I was not uncertain as to the effects to flow from the discovery of her fate. I confided not at all in the efforts of his reason or his piety. There were few
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
evils which his modes of thinking would not disarm of their sting; but here, all opiates to grief, and all compellers of patience were vain. This spectacle would be unavoidably followed by the outrages of desperation, and a rushing to death.</P>
<P>For the present, I neglected to ask myself what motive brought him hither. I was only fearful of the effects to flow from the sight of the dead. Yet could it be long concealed from him? Some time and speedily he would obtain this knowledge. No stratagems could considerably or usefully prolong his ignorance. All that could be sought was to take away the abruptness of the change, and shut out the confusion of despair, and the inroads of madness: but I knew my brother, and knew that all exertions to console him would be fruitless.</P>
<P>What could I say? I was mute, and poured forth those tears on his account, which my own unhappiness had been unable to extort. In the midst of my tears, I was not unobservant of his motions. These were of a nature to rouse some other sentiment than grief, or, at least, to mix with it a portion of astonishment.</P>
<P>His countenance suddenly became troubled. His hands were clasped with a force that left the print of his nails in his flesh. His eyes were fixed on my feet. His brain seemed to swell beyond its con∣tinent. He did not cease to breathe, but his breath was stifled into groans. I had never witnessed the hurricane of human passions. My element had, till lately, been all sunshine and calm. I was un∣conversant with the altitudes and energies of senti∣ment, and was transfixed with inexplicable horror by the symptoms which I now beheld.</P>
<P>After a silence and a conflict which I could not interpret, he lifted his eyes to heaven, and in broken
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
accents exclaimed, "This is too much! Any vic∣am but this, and thy will be done. Have I not suf∣ficiently attested my faith and my obedience? She that is gone, they that have perished, were linked with my soul by ties which only thy command would have broken; but here is sanctity and ex∣cellence surpassing human. This workmanship is thine, and it cannot be thy will to heap it into ruins."</P>
<P>Here suddenly unclasping his hands, he struck one of them against his forehead, and continued— "Wretch! who made thee quicksighted in the councils of thy Maker? Deliverance from mortal fetters is awarded to this being, and thou art the minister of this decree."</P>
<P>So saying, Wieland advanced towards me. His words and his motions were without meaning, ex∣cept on one supposition. The death of Catharine was already known to him, and that knowledge, as might have been suspected, had destroyed his reason. I had feared nothing less; but now that I beheld the extinction of a mind the most luminous and penetrating that ever dignified the human form, my sensations were fraught with new and insupportable anguish.</P>
<P>I had not time to reflect in what way my own safety would be effected by this revolution, or what I had to dread from the wild conceptions of a mad∣man. He advanced towards me. Some hollow noises were wafted by the breeze. Confused cla∣mours were succeeded by many feet traversing the grass, and then crowding into the piazza.</P>
<P>These sounds suspended my brother's purpose, and he stood to listen. The signals multiplied and grew louder; perceiving this, he turned from me, and hurried out of my sight. All about me was
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
pregnant with motives to astonishment. My sis∣ter's corpse, Wieland's frantic demeanour, and, at length, this crowd of visitants so little accorded with my foresight, that my mental progress was stopped. The impulse had ceased which was accustomed to give motion and order to my thoughts.</P>
<P>Footsteps thronged upon the stairs, and presently many faces shewed themselves within the door of my apartment. These looks were full of alarm and watchfulness. They pryed into corners as if in search of some fugitive; next their gaze was fixed upon me, and betokened all the vehemence of terror and pity. For a time I questioned whether these were not shapes and faces like that which I had seen at the bottom of the stairs, creatures of my fancy or airy existences.</P>
<P>My eye wandered from one to another, till at length it fell on a countenance which I well knew. It was that of Mr. Hallet. This man was a dis∣tant kinsman of my mother, venerable for his age, his uprightness, and sagacity. He had long dis∣charged the functions of a magistrate and good citi∣zen. If any terrors remained, his presence was sufficient to dispel them.</P>
<P>He approached, took my hand with a compassion∣ate air, and said in a low voice, "Where, my dear Clara, are your brother and sister?" I made no answer, but pointed to the bed. His attendants drew aside the curtain, and while their eyes glared with horror at the spectacle which they beheld, those of Mr. Hallet overflowed with tears.</P>
<P>After considerable pause, he once more turned to me. "My dear girl, this sight is not for you. Can you confide in my care, and that of Mrs. Baynton's? We will see performed all that cir∣cumstances require."</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="191"/>I made strenuous opposition to this request. I insisted on remaining near her till she were interred. His remonstrances, however, and my own feelings, shewed me the propriety of a temporary dereliction. Louisa stood in need of a comforter, and my bro∣ther's children of a nurse. My unhappy brother was himself an object of solicitude and care. At length, I consented to relinquish the corpse, and go to my brother's, whose house, I said, would need mistress, and his children a parent.</P>
<P>During this discourse, my venerable friend strug∣gled with his tears, but my last intimation called them forth with fresh violence. Meanwhile, his attendants stood round in mournful silence, gaz∣ing on me and at each other. I repeated my reso∣lution, and rose to execute it; but he took my hand to detain me. His countenance betrayed irresolu∣tion and reluctance. I requested him to state the reason of his opposition to this measure. I entreat∣ed him to be explicit. I told him that my his brother had just been there, and that I knew his condition. This misfortune had driven him to madness, and his offspring must not want a protector. If he chose, I would resign Wieland to his care; but his innocent and helpless babes stood in instant need of nurse and mother, and these offices I would by no means allow another to perform while I had life.</P>
<P>Every word that I uttered seemed to augment his perplexity and distress. At last he said, "I think, Clara, I have entitled myself to some regard from you. You have professed your willingness to ob∣lige me. Now I call upon you to confer upon me the highest obligation in your power. Permit Mrs. Baynton to have the management of your brother's house for two or three days; then it shall be yours to act in it as you please. No matter what are my
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
motives in making this request: perhaps I think your age, your sex, or the distress which this dis∣aster must occasion, incapacitates you for the office. Surely you have no doubt of Mrs. Baynton's ten∣derness or discretion."</P>
<P>New ideas now rushed into my mind. I fixed my eyes stedfastly on Mr. Hallet. "Are they well?" said I. "Is Louisa well? Are Benjamin, and William, and Constantine, and Little Clara, are they safe? Tell me truly, I beseech you!"</P>
<P>"They are well," he replied; "they are per∣fectly safe."</P>
<P>"Fear no effeminate weekness in me: I can bear to hear the truth. Tell me truly, are they well?"</P>
<P>He again assured me that they were well.</P>
<P>"What then," resumed I, "do you fear? Is it possible for any calamity to disqualify me for per∣forming my duty to these helpless innocents? I am willing to divide the care of them with Mrs. Bayn∣ton; I shall be grateful for her sympathy and aid; but what should I be to desert them at an hour like this!"</P>
<P>I will cut short this distressful dialogue. I still persisted in my purpose, and he still persisted in his opposition. This excited my suspicions anew; but these were removed by solemn declarations of their safety. I could not explain this conduct in my friend; but at length consented to go to the city, provided I should see them for a few minutes at present, and should return on the morrow.</P>
<P>Even this arrangement was objected to. At length he told me they were removed to the city. Why were they removed, I asked, and whither▪ My importunities would not now be eluded. My suspicions were roused, and no evasion or artifice was sufficient to allay them. Many of the aud∣ience
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
began to give vent to their emotions in tears. Mr. Hallet himself seemed as if the conflict were too hard to be longer sustained. Something whis∣pered to my heart that havoc had been wider than I now witnessed. I suspected this concealment to arise from apprehensions of the effects which a knowledge of the truth would produce in me. I since more entreated him to inform me truly of their state. To enforce my entreaties, I put on an air of insensibility. "I can guess," said I, "what has happened—They are indeed beyond the reach of injury, for they are dead! Is it not so?" My voice faltered in spite of my courageous efforts.</P>
<P>"Yes," said he, "they are dead! Dead by the same fate, and by the same hand, with their mo∣ther"</P>
<P>"Dead!" replied I; "what, all?"</P>
<P>"All!" replied he: "he spared <HI>not one!"</HI></P>
<P>Allow me, my friends, to close my eyes upon he after-scene. Why should I protract a tale which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> already begin to feel is too long? Over this scene <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> least let me pass lightly. Here, indeed, my nar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ative would be imperfect. All was tempestuous commotion in my heart and in my brain. I have to memory for ought but unconscious transitions and rueful sights. I was ingenious and indefatiga∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e in the invention of torments. I would not dis∣pense with any spectacle adapted to exasperate my grief. Each pale and mangled form I crushed to my bosom. Louisa, whom I loved with so ineffable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passion, was denied to me at first, but my obsti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acy conquered their reluctance.</P>
<P>They led the way into a darkened hall. A lamp <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endant from the ceiling was uncovered, and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ointed to a table. The assassin had defrauded me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f my last and miserable consolation. I sought not
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
not in her visage, for the tinge of the morning, and the lustre of heaven. These had vanished with life; but I hoped for liberty to print a last kiss upon her lips. This was denied me; for such had been the merciless blow that destroyed her, that not a <HI>lineament remained!</HI></P>
<P>I was carried hence to the city. Mrs. Hallet was my companion and my nurse. Why should I dwell upon the rage of fever, and the effusions of deli∣rium? Carwin was the phantom that pursued my dreams, the giant oppressor under whose arm I was for ever on the point of being crushed. Strenuous muscles were required to hinder my flight, and hearts of steel to withstand the eloquence of my fears. In vain I called upon them to look upward to mark his sparkling rage and scowling contempt All I sought was to fly from the stroke that was lift¦ed. Then I heaped upon my guards the most vehe¦ment reproaches, or betook myself to wailings of the haplessness of my condition.</P>
<P>This malady, at length, declined, and my weep¦ing friends began to look for my restoration. Slow¦ly, and with intermitted beams, memory revisite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me. The scenes that I had witnessed were revived became the theme of deliberation and deduction and called forth the effusions of more rational sor¦row.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD imperfectly recovered my strength, when I was informed of the arrival of my mother's bro∣ther, Thomas Cambridge. Ten years since, he went to Europe, and was a surgeon in the British forces in Germany, during the whole of the late war. After its conclusion, some connection that he had formed with an Irish officer, made him re∣tire into Ireland. Intercourse had been punctually maintained by letters with his sister's children, and hopes were given that he would shortly return to his native country, and pass his old age in our so∣ciety. He was now in an evil hour arrived.</P>
<P>I desired an interview with him for numerous and urgent reasons. With the first returns of my understanding I had anxiously sought information of the fate of my brother. During the course of my disease I had never seen him; and vague and unsatisfactory answers were returned to all my in∣quiries. I had vehemently interrogated Mrs. Hallet and her husband, and solicited an interview with this unfortunate man; but they mysteriously in∣sinuated that his reason was still unsettled, and that his circumstances rendered an interview impossible. Their reserve on the particulars of this destruction, and the author of it, was equally invincible.</P>
<P>For some time, finding all my efforts fruitless, I had desisted from direct inquiries and solicitations, determined, as soon as my strength was sufficiently renewed, to pursue other means of dispelling my un∣certainty.
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
In this state of things my uncle's arri∣val and intention to visit me were announced. I almost shuddered to behold the face of this man. When I reflected on the disasters that had befallen us, I was half unwilling to witness that dejection and grief which would be disclosed in his counte∣nance. But I believed that all transactions had been thoroughly disclosed to him, and confided in my importunity to extort from him the knowledge that I sought.</P>
<P>I had no doubt as to the person of our enemy; but the motives that urged him to perpetrate these horrors, the means that he used, and his present condition, were totally unknown. It was reason∣able to expect some information on this head, from my uncle. I therefore waited his coming with impatience. At length, in the dusk of the even∣ing, and in my solitary chamber, this meeting took place.</P>
<P>This man was our nearest relation, and had ever treated us with the affection of a parent. Our meeting, therefore, could not be without overflow∣ing tenderness and gloomy joy. He rather en∣couraged than restrained the tears that I poured out in his arms, and took upon himself the task of comforter. Allusions to recent disasters could not be long omitted. One topic facilitated the admis∣sion of another. At length, I mentioned and de∣plored the ignorance in which I had been kept re∣specting my brother's destiny, and the circum∣stances of our misfortunes. I entreated him to tell me what was Wieland's condition, and what pro∣gress had been made in detecting or punishing the author of this unheard of devastation.</P>
<P>"The author!" said he; "Do you know the author?"</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="197"/>"Alas!" I answered, "I am too well acquainted with him. The story of the grounds of my sus∣picions would be painful and too long. I am not apprized of the extent of your present knowledge. There are none but Wieland, Pleyel, and myself, who are able to relate certain facts."</P>
<P>"Spare yourself the pain," said he. "All that Wieland and Pleyel can communicate, I know already. If any thing of moment has fallen within your own exclusive knowledge, and the relation be not too arduous for your present strength, I confess I am desirous of hearing it. Perhaps you allude to one by the name of Carwin. I will anticipate your curiosity by saying, that since these disasters, no one has seen or heard of him. His agency is, therefore, a mystery still unsolved."</P>
<P>I readily complied with his request, and related as distinctly as I could, though in general terms, the events transacted in the summer-house and my chamber. He listened without apparent surprize to the tale of Pleyel's errors and suspicions, and with augmented seriousness, to my narrative of the warn∣ings and inexplicable vision, and the letter found upon the table. I waited for his comments.</P>
<P>"You gather from this," said he, "that Car∣win is the author of all this misery."</P>
<P>"Is it not," answered I, "an unavoidable in∣ference? But what know you respecting it? Was it possible to execute this mischief without witness or coadjutor? I beseech you to relate to me, when and why Mr. Hallet was summoned to the scene, and by whom this disaster was first suspected or discovered. Surely, suspicion must have fallen upon some one, and pursuit was made."</P>
<P>My uncle rose from his seat, and traversed the floor with hasty steps. His eyes were fixed upon
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
the ground, and he seemed buried in perplexity. At length he paused, and said with an emphatic tone, "It is true; the instrument is known. Car∣win may have plotted, but the execution was ano∣ther's. That other is found, and his deed is ascer∣tained."</P>
<P>"Good heaven!" I exclaimed, "what say you? Was not Carwin the assassin? Could any hand but his have carried into act this dreadful purpose?"</P>
<P>"Have I not said," returned he, "that the per∣formance was another's? Carwin, perhaps, or heaven, or insanity, prompted the murderer; but Carwin is unknown. The actual performer has, long since, been called to judgment and convicted, and is, at this moment, at the bottom of a dungeon loaded with chains."</P>
<P>I lifted my hands and eyes. "Who then is this assassin? By what means, and whither was he traced? What is the testimony of his guilt?"</P>
<P>"His own, corroborated with that of a servant-maid who spied the murder of the children from a closet where she was concealed. The magistrate re∣turned from your dwelling to your brother's. He was employed in hearing and recording the testi∣mony of the only witness, when the criminal him∣self, unexpected, unsolicited, unsought, entered the hall, acknowledged his guilt, and rendered himself up to justice.</P>
<P>"He has since been summoned to the bar. The audience was composed of thousands whom ru∣mours of this wonderful event had attracted from the greatest distance. A long and impartial ex∣amination was made, and the prisoner was called upon for his defence. In compliance with this call he delivered an ample relation of his motives and actions." There he stopped.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199"/>I besought him to say who this criminal was, and what the instigations that compelled him. My uncle was silent. I urged this inquiry with new force. I reverted to my own knowledge, and sought in this some basis to conjecture. I ran over the scanty catalogue of the men whom I knew; I lighted on no one who was qualified for minister∣ing to malice like this. Again I resorted to im∣portunity. Had I ever seen the criminal? Was it sheer cruelty, or diabolical revenge that produced this overthrow?</P>
<P>He surveyed me, for a considerable time, and listened to my interrogations in silence. At length he spoke: "Clara, I have known thee by report, and in some degree by observation. Thou art a being of no vulgar sort. Thy friends have hitherto treated thee as a child. They meant well, but, perhaps, they were unacquainted with thy strength. I assure myself that nothing will surpass thy forti∣tude.</P>
<P>"Thou art anxious to know the destroyer of thy family, his actions, and his motives. Shall I call him to thy presence▪ and permit him to confess before thee? Shall I make him the narrator of his own tale?"</P>
<P>I started on my feet, and looked round me with fearful glances, as if the murderer was close at hand. "What do you mean?" said I; "put an end, I beseech you, to this suspence."</P>
<P>"Be not alarmed; you will never more behold the face of this criminal, unless he be gifted with supernatural strength, and sever like threads the constraint of links and bolts. I have said that the assassin was arraigned at the bar, and that the trial ended with a summons from the judge to confess or to vindicate his actions. A reply was immediately
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
made with significance of gesture, and a tranquil majesty, which denoted less of humanity than god∣head. Judges, advocates and auditors were panic-struck and breathless with attention. One of the hearers faithfully recorded the speech. There it is," continued he, putting a roll of papers in my hand, "you may read it at your leisure."</P>
<P>With these words my uncle left me alone. My curiosity refused me a moment's delay. I opened the papers, and read as follows.</P>

<P>"THEODORE WIELAND, the prisoner at the bar, was now called upon for his defence. He looked around him for some time in silence, and with a mild countenance. At length he spoke:</P>
<P>"It is strange; I am known to my judges and my auditors. Who is there present a stranger to the character of Wieland? who knows him not as an husband—as a father—as a friend? yet here am I arraigned as criminal. I am charged with dia∣bolical malice; I am accused of the murder of my wife and my children!</P>
<P>"It is true, they were slain by me; they all pe∣rished by my hand. The task of vindication is ig∣noble. What is it that I am called to vindicate? and before whom?</P>
<P>"You know that they are dead, and that they were killed by me. What more would you have? Would you extort from me a statement of my mo∣tives? Have you failed to discover them already? You charge me with malice; but your eyes are not shut; your reason is still vigorous; your memory has not forsaken you. You know whom it is that you thus charge. The habits of his life are known to you; his treatment of his wife and his offspring is known to you; the soundness of his integrity, and the unchangeableness of his principles, are fa∣miliar to your apprehension; yet you persist in this charge! You lead me hither manacled as a fe∣lon, you deem me worthy of a vile and tormenting death!</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="202"/>"Who are they whom I have devoted to death? My wife—the little ones, that drew their being from me—that creature who, as she surpassed them in excellence, claimed a larger affection than those whom natural affinities bound to my heart. Think ye that malice could have urged me to this deed? Hide your audacious fronts from the scrutiny of heaven. Take refuge in some cavern unvisited by human eyes. Ye may deplore your wickedness or folly, but ye cannot expiate it.</P>
<P>"Think not that I speak for your sakes. Hug to your hearts this detestable infatuation. Deem me still a murderer, and drag me to untimely death. I make not an effort to dispel your illusion: I utter not a word to cure you of your sanguinary folly: but there are probably some in this assembly who have come from far: for their sakes, whose distance has disabled them from knowing me, I will tell what I have done, and why.</P>
<P>"It is needless to say that God is the object of my supreme passion. I have cherished, in his pre∣sence, a single and upright heart. I have thirsted for the knowledge of his will. I have burnt with ardour to approve my faith and my obedience.</P>
<P>"My days have been spent in searching for the revelation of that will; but my days have been mournful, because my search failed. I solicited direction: I turned on every side where glimmer∣ings of light could be discovered. I have not been wholly uninformed; but my knowledge has always stopped short of certainty. Dissatisfaction has in∣sinuated itself into all my thoughts. My purposes have been pure; my wishes indefatigable; but not till lately were these purposes thoroughly accom∣plished, and these wishes fully gratified.</P>
<P>"I thank thee, my father, for thy bounty, that
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
thou didst not ask a less sacrifice than this; that thou placedst me in a condition to testify my sub∣mission to thy will! What have I withheld which it was thy pleasure to exact? Now may I, with dauntless and erect eye, claim my reward, since I have given thee the treasure of my soul.</P>
<P>"I was at my own house: it was late in the evening: my sister had gone to the city, but pro∣posed to return. It was in expectation of her re∣turn that my wife and I delayed going to bed be∣yond the usual hour; the rest of the family, how∣ever, were retired.</P>
<P>"My mind was contemplative and calm; not wholly devoid of apprehension on account of my sister's safety. Recent events, not easily explained, had suggested the existence of some danger; but this danger was without a distinct from in our im∣agination, and scarcely ruffled our tranquillity.</P>
<P>"Time passed, and my sister did not arrive; her house is at some distance from mine, and though her arrangements had been made with a view to residing with us, it was possible that, through for∣getfulness, or the occurrence of unforeseen emer∣gencies, she had returned to her own dwelling.</P>
<P>"Hence it was conceived proper that I should ascertain the truth by going thither. I went. On my way my mind was full of these ideas which re∣lated to my intellectual condition. In the torrent of fervid conceptions, I lost sight of my purpose. Some times I stood still; some times I wandered from my path, and experienced some difficulty, on recovering from my fit of musing, to regain it.</P>
<P>"The series of my thoughts is easily traced. At first every vein beat with raptures known only to the man whose parental and conjugal love is with∣out
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
limits, and the cup of whose desires, immense as it is, overflows with gratification. I know not why emotions that were perpetual visitants should now have recurred with unusual energy. The transition was not new from sensations of joy to a consciousness of gratitude. The author of my be∣ing was likewise the dispenser of every gift with which that being was embellished. The service to which a benefactor like this was entitled, could not be circumscribed. My social sentiments were in∣debted to their alliance with devotion for all their value. All passions are base, all joys feeble, all energies malignant, which are not drawn from this source.</P>
<P>"For a time, my contemplations soared above earth and its inhabitants. I stretched forth my hands; I lifted my eyes, and exclaimed, O! that I might be admitted to thy presence; that mine were the supreme delight of knowing thy will, and of performing it! The blissful privilege of direct communication with thee, and of listening to the audible enunciation of thy pleasure!</P>
<P>"What task would I not undertake, what pri∣vation would I not cheerfully endure, to testify my love of thee? Alas! thou hidest thyself from my view: glimpses only of thy excellence and beauty are afforded me. Would that a momentary ema∣nation from thy glory would visit me! that some unambiguous token of thy presence would salute my senses!</P>
<P>"In this mood, I entered the house of my sister. It was vacant. Scarcely had I regained recollection of the purpose that brought me hither. Thoughts of a different tendency had such absolute possession of my mind, that the relations of time and space
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
were almost obliterated from my understanding. These wanderings, however, were restrained, and I ascended to her chamber.</P>
<P>"I had no light, and might have known by ex∣ternal observation, that the house was without any inhabitant. With this, however, I was not satisfied. I entered the room, and the object of my search not appearing, I prepared to return.</P>
<P>"The darkness required some caution in de∣scending the stair. I stretched my hand to seize the balustrade by which I might regulate my steps. How shall I describe the lustre, which, at that mo∣ment, burst upon my vision!</P>
<P>"I was dazzled. My organs were bereaved of their activity. My eye-lids were half-closed, and my hands withdrawn from the balustrade. A name∣less fear chilled my veins, and I stood motionless. This irradiation did not retire or lessen. It seemed as if some powerful effulgence covered me like a mantle.</P>
<P>"I opened my eyes and found all about me lu∣minous and glowing. It was the element of heaven that flowed around. Nothing but a fiery stream was at first visible; but, anon, a shrill voice from behind called upon me to attend.</P>
<P>"I turned: It is forbidden to describe what I saw: Words, indeed, would be wanting to the task. The lineaments of that being, whose veil was now lifted, and whose visage beamed upon my sight, no hues of pencil or of language can pour∣tray.</P>
<P>"As it spoke, the accents thrilled to my heart. "Thy, prayers are heard. In proof of thy faith, render me thy wife. This is the victim I chuse. Call her hither, and here let her fall."—The sound, and visage, and light vanished at once.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206"/>"What demand was this? The blood of Ca∣tharine was to be shed! My wife was to perish by my hand! I sought opportunity to attest my virtue. Little did I expect that a proof like this would have been demanded.</P>
<P>"My wife! I exclaimed: O God! substitute some other victim. Make me not the butcher of my wife. My own blood is cheap. This will I pour out before thee with a willing heart; but spare, I beseech thee, this precious life, or commis∣sion some other than her husband to perform the bloody deed.</P>
<P>"In vain. The conditions were prescribed; the decree had gone forth, and nothing remained but to execute it. I rushed out of the house and across the intermediate fields, and stopped not till I entered my own parlour.</P>
<P>"My wife had remained here during my ab∣sence, in anxious expectation of my return with some tidings of her sister. I had none to commu∣nicate. For a time, I was breathless with my speed: This, and the tremors that shook my frame, and the wildness of my looks, alarmed her. She im∣mediately suspected some disaster to have happened to her friend, and her own speech was as much overpowered by emotion as mine.</P>
<P>"She was silent, but her looks manifested her impatience to hear what I had to communicate. I spoke, but with so much precipitation as scarcely to be understood; catching her, at the same time, by the arm, and forcibly pulling her from her seat.</P>
<P>"Come along with me: fly: waste not a mo∣ment: time will be lost, and the deed will be omit∣ted. Tarry not; question not; but fly with me▪</P>
<P>"This deportment added afresh to her alarms Her eyes pursued mine, and she said, "What is the
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
matter? For God's sake what is the matter? Where would you have me go?"</P>
<P>"My eyes were fixed upon her countenance while she spoke. I thought upon her virtues; I viewed her as the mother of my babes; as my wife: I recalled the purpose for which I thus urged her attendance. My heart faltered, and I saw that I must rouse to this work all my faculties. The danger of the least delay was imminent.</P>
<P>"I looked away from her, and again exerting my force, drew her towards the door—'You must go with me—indeed you must.'</P>
<P>"In her fright she half-resisted my efforts, and again exclaimed, 'Good heaven! what is it you mean? Where go? What has happened? Have you found Clara?'</P>
<P>"Follow me, and you will see," I answered, still urging her reluctant steps forward.</P>
<P>"What phrenzy has seized you? Something must needs have happened. Is she sick? Have you found her?"</P>
<P>"Come and see. Follow me, and know for yourself."</P>
<P>"Still she expostulated and besought me to ex∣plain this mysterious behaviour. I could not trust myself to answer her; to look at her; but grasping her arm, I drew her after me. She hesitated, rather through confusion of mind than from unwilling∣ness to accompany me. This confusion gradually abated, and she moved forward, but with irresolute footsteps, and continual exclamations of wonder and terror. Her interrogations of "what was the matter?" and "whither was I going?" were cease∣less and vehement.</P>
<P>"It was the scope of my efforts not to think; to keep up a conflict and uproar in my mind in
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
which all order and distinctness should be lost; to escape from the sensations produced by her voice. I was, therefore, silent. I strove to abridge this interval by my haste, and to waste all my attention in furious gesticulations.</P>
<P>"In this state of mind we reached my sister's door. She looked at the windows and saw that all was desolate—"Why come we here? There is no body here. I will not go in."</P>
<P>"Still I was dumb; but opening the door, I drew her into the entry. This was the allotted scene▪ here she was to fall. I let go her hand, and pressing my palms against my forehead, made one mighty effort to work up my soul to the deed.</P>
<P>"In vain; it would not be; my courage was appalled; my arms nerveless: I muttered prayers that my strength might be aided from above. They availed nothing.</P>
<P>"Horror diffused itself over me. This con∣viction of my cowardice, my rebellion, fastened upon me, and I stood rigid and cold as marble. From this state I was somewhat relieved by my wife's voice, who renewed her supplications to be told why we came hither, and what was the fate of my sister.</P>
<P>"What could I answer? My words were bro∣ken and inarticulate. Her fears naturally acquired force from the observation of these symptoms; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these fears were misplaced. The only inference she deduced from my conduct was, that some ter∣rible mishap had befallen Clara.</P>
<P>"She wrung her hands, and exclaimed in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agony, "O tell me, where is she? What has be¦come of her? Is she sick? Dead? Is she in he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> chamber? O let me go thither and know th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worst!"</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209"/>"This proposal set my thoughts one more in motion. Perhaps what my rebellious heart refused to perform here, I might obtain strength enough to execute elsewhere.</P>
<P>"Come then," said I, "let us go."</P>
<P>"I will, but not in the dark. We must first procure a light."</P>
<P>"Fly then and procure it; but I charge you, lin∣ger not. I will await for your return.</P>
<P>"While she was gone, I strode along the entry. The sellness of a gloomy hurricane but faintly re∣sembled the discord that reigned in my mind. To omit this sacrifice must not be; yet my sinews had refused to perform it. No alternative was offered. To rebel against the mandate was impossible; but obedience would render me the executioner of my wife. My will was strong, but my limbs refused their office.</P>
<P>"She returned with a light; I led the way to the chamber; she looked round her; she lifted the curtain of the bed; she saw nothing.</P>
<P>"At length, she fixed inquiring eyes upon me. The light now enabled her to discover in my visage what darkness had hitherto concealed. Her cares were now transferred from my sister to myself, and she said in a tremulous voice. "Wieland! you are not well: What ails you? Can I do nothing for you?"</P>
<P>"That accents and looks so winning should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sarm me of my resolution, was to be expected. My thoughts were thrown anew into anarchy. I spread my hand before my eyes that I might not see her, and answered only by groans. She took my other hand between her's, and pressing it to her heart▪ spoke with that voice which had ever swayed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y will, and wasted away sorrow.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="210"/>"My friend! my soul's friend! tell me thy cause of grief. Do I not merit to partake with thee in thy cares? Am I not thy wife?"</P>
<P>"This was too much. I broke from her em∣brace, and retired to a corner of the room. In this pause, courage was once more infused into me. I resolved to execute my duty. She followed me, and renewed her passionate entreaties to know the cause of my distress.</P>
<P>"I raised my head and regarded her with stedfast looks. I muttered something about death, and the injunctions of my duty. At these words she shrunk back, and looked at me with a new expression of anguish. After a pause, she clasped her hands, and exclaimed—</P>
<P>"O Wieland! Wieland! God grant that I am mistaken; but surely something is wrong. I see it: it is too plain: thou art undone—lost to me and to thyself." At the same time she gazed on my fea∣tures with intensest anxiety, in hope that different symptoms would take place. I replied to her with vehemence—</P>
<P>"Undone! No; my duty is known, and I thank my God that my cowardice is now vanquished, and I have power to fulfil it. Catharine! I pity the weakness of thy nature: I pity thee, but must not spare. Thy life is claimed from my hands: thou must die!"</P>
<P>"Fear was now added to her grief. 'What mean you? Why talk you of death? Bethink yourself, Wieland: bethink yourself, and this fit will pass. O why came I hither! Why did you drag me hither?'</P>
<P>"I brought thee hither to fulfil a divine com∣mand. I am appointed thy destroyer, and destroy thee I must." Saying this I seized her wrists. She
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
shrieked aloud, and endeavoured to free herself from my grasp; but her efforts were vain.</P>
<P>"Surely, surely Wieland, thou dost not mean it. Am I not thy wife? and wouldst thou kill me? Thou wilt not; and yet—I see—thou art Wieland no longer! A fury resistless and horrible possesses thee—Spare me—spare—help—help—"</P>
<P>"Till her breath was stopped she shrieked for help—for mercy. When she could speak no longer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er gestures, her looks appealed to my compassion. My accursed hand was irresolute and tremulous. I meant thy death to be sudden, thy struggles to be brief. Alas! my heart was infirm; my resolves mutable. Thrice I slackened my grasp, and life kept its hold, though in the midst of pangs. Her eye-balls started from their sockets. Grimness and distortion took place of all that used to bewitch me into transport, and subdue me into reverence.</P>
<P>"I was commissioned to kill thee, but not to torment thee with the foresight of thy death; not to multiply thy fears, and prolong thy agonies. Haggard, and pale, and lifeless, at length thou ceasedst to contend with thy destiny.</P>
<P>"This was a moment of triumph. Thus had I successfully subdued the stubbornness of human passions: the victim which had been demanded was given: the deed was done past recal.</P>
<P>"I lifted the corpse in my arms and laid it on the bed. I gazed upon it with delight. Such was the elation of my thoughts, that I even broke into laughter. I clapped my hands and exclaimed, 'It is done! My sacred duty is fulfilled! To that I have sacrificed, O my God! thy last and best gift, my wife!'</P>
<P>"For a while I thus soared above frailty. I im∣agined I had set myself forever beyond the reach of
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
selfishness; but my imaginations were false. This rapture quickly subsided. I looked again at my wife. My joyous ebullitions vanished, and I ask∣ed myself who it was whom I saw? Methought it could not be Catharine. It could not be the wo∣man who had lodged for years in my heart; who had slept, nightly, in my bosom; who had borne in her womb, who had fostered at her breast, the beings who called me father; whom I had watched with delight, and cherished with a fondness ever new and perpetually growing: it could not be the same.</P>
<P>"Where was her bloom! These deadly and blood-suffused orbs but ill resemble the azure and exstatic tenderness of her eyes. The lucid stream that meandered over that bosom, the glow of love that was wont to sit upon that cheek, are much un∣like these livid stains and this hideous deformity. Alas' these were the traces of agony; the gripe of the assassin had been here!</P>
<P>"I will not dwell upon my lapse into desperate and outrageous sorrow. The breath of heaven that sustained me was withdrawn, and I sunk into <HI>mere man.</HI> I leaped from the floor: I dashed my head against the wall: I uttered screams of horror: I panted after torment and pain. Eternal fire, and the bickerings of hell, compared with what I felt, were music and a bed of roses.</P>
<P>"I thank my God that this degeneracy was tran∣sient, that he deigned once more to raise me aloft. I thought upon what I had done as a sacrifice to duty, and <HI>was calm.</HI> My wife was dead; but I reflected, that though this source of human conso∣lation was closed, yet others were still open. It the transports of an husband were no more, the feelings of a father had still scope for exercise. When remembrance of their mother should excite
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
too keen a pang, I would look upon them, and <HI>be comforted.</HI></P>
<P>"While I revolved these ideas, new warmth flowed in upon my heart—I was wrong. These feelings were the growth of selfishness. Of this I was not aware, and to dispel the mist that obscured my perceptions, a new effulgence and a new man∣date were necessary.</P>
<P>"From these thoughts I was recalled by a ray that was shot into the room. A voice spake like that which I had before heard—'Thou hast done well; but all is not done—the sacrifice is incom∣plete—thy children must be offered—they must pe∣rish with their mother!—'</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>WILL you wonder that I read no farther? Will you not rather he astonished that I read thus far? What power supported me through such a task I know not. Perhaps the doubt from which I could not disengage my mind, that the scene here depicted was a dream, contributed to my persever∣ance. In vain the solemn introduction of my un∣cle, his appeals to my fortitude, and allusions to something monstrous in the events he was about to disclose; in vain the distressful perplexity, the mys∣terious silence and ambiguous answers of my atten∣dants, especially when the condition of my brother was the theme of my inquiries, were remembered I recalled the interview with Wieland in my cham∣ber, his preternatural tranquillity succeeded by bursts of passion and menacing actions. All these coin∣cided with the tenor of this paper.</P>
<P>Catharine and her children, and Louisa were dead. The act that destroyed them was, in the highest degree, inhuman. It was worthy of sava∣ges trained to murder, and exulting in agonies.</P>
<P>Who was the performer of the deed? Wieland▪ My brother! The husband and the father! That man of gentle virtues and invincible benign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty▪ placable and mild—an idolator of peace! Surely, said I, it is a dream. For many days have I been vexed with frenzy. Its dominion is still felt; but new forms are called up to diversify and augment my torments.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215"/>The paper dropped from my hand, and my eyes followed it. I shrunk back, as if to avoid some petrifying influence that approached me. My tongue was mute; all the functions of nature were at a stand, and I sunk upon the floor lifeless.</P>
<P>The noise of my fall, as I afterwards heard, alarmed my uncle, who was in a lower apartment, and whose apprehensions had detained him. He hastened to my chamber, and administered the as∣sistance which my condition required. When I opened my eyes I beheld him before me. His skill as a reasoner as well as a physician, was exerted to obviate the injurious effects of this disclosure; but he had wrongly estimated the strength of my body or of my mind. This new shock brought me once more to the brink of the grave, and my ma∣lady was much more difficult to subdue than at first.</P>
<P>I will not dwell upon the long train of dreary sensations, and the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deous confusion of my under∣standing. Time slowly restored its customary firm∣ness to my frame, and order to my thoughts. The images impressed upon my mind by this fatal paper were somewhat effaced by my malady. They were obscure and disjointed like the parts of a dream. I was desirous of freeing my imagination from this chaos. For this end I questioned my uncle, who was my constant companion. He was intimidated by the issue of his first experiment, and took pains to elude or discourage my inquiry. My impetuo∣sity some times compelled him to have resort to misrepresentations and untruths.</P>
<P>Time effected that end, perhaps, in a more be∣neficial manner. In the course of my meditations the recollections of the past gradually became more distinct. I revolved them, however, in silence,
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
and being no longer accompanied with surprize, they did not exercise a death-dealing power. I had discontinued the perusal of the paper in the midst of the narrative; but what I read, combined with information elsewhere obtained, threw, perhaps, a sufficient light upon these detestable transactions; yet my curiosity was not inactive. I desired to peruse the remainder.</P>
<P>My eagerness to know the particulars of this tale was mingled and abated by my antipathy to the scene which would be disclosed. Hence I employ∣ed no means to effect my purpose. I desired know∣ledge, and, at the same time, shrunk back from receiving the boon.</P>
<P>One morning, being left alone, I rose from my bed, and went to a drawer where my finer cloth∣ing used to be kept. I opened it, and this fatal pa∣per saluted my sight. I snatched it involuntarily, and withdrew to a chair. I debated, for a few mi∣nutes, whether I should open and read. Now that my fortitude was put to trial, it failed. I felt my∣self incapable of deliberately surveying a scene of so much horror. I was prompted to return it to its place, but this resolution gave way, and I deter∣mined to peruse some part of it. I turned over the leaves till I came near the conclusion. The nar∣rative of the criminal was finished. The verdict of <HI>guilty</HI> reluctantly pronounced by the jury, and the accused interrogated why sentence of death should not pass. The answer was brief, solemn, and emphatical.</P>
<P>"No. I have nothing to say. My tale has been told. My motives have been truly stated. If my judges are unable to discern the purity of my inten∣tions, or to credit the statement of them, which I have just made; if they see not that my deed was
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
enjoined by heaven; that obedience was the test of perfect virtue, and the extinction of selfishness and error, they must pronounce me a murderer.</P>
<P>"They refuse to credit my tale; they impute my acts to the influence of daemons; they account me an example of the highest wickedness of which human nature is capable; they doom me to death and infamy. Have I power to escape this evil? If I have, be sure I will exert it. I will not accept evil at their hand, when I am entitled to good; I will suffer only when I cannot elude suffering.</P>
<P>"You say that I am guilty. Impious and rash! thus to usurp the prerogatives of your Maker! to set up your bounded views and halting reason, as the measure of truth!</P>
<P>"Thou, Omnipotent and Holy! Thou knowest that my actions were conformable to thy will. I know not what is crime; what actions are evil in their ultimate and comprehensive tendency or what are good. Thy knowledge, as thy power, is unlimited. I have taken thee for my guide, and cannot err. To the arms of thy protection, I en∣trust my safety. In the awards of thy justice, I confide for my recompense.</P>
<P>"Come death when it will, I am safe. Let calumny and abhorrence pursue me among men; I shall not be defrauded of my dues. The peace of virtue, and the glory of obedience, will be my por∣tion hereafter."</P>
<P>Here ended the speaker. I withdrew my eyes from the page; but before I had time to reflect on what I had read, Mr. Cambridge entered the room. He quickly perceived how I had been employed, and betrayed some solicitude respecting the condi∣tion of my mind.</P>
<P>His fears, however, were superfluous. What I
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
had read, threw me into a state not easily described Anguish and fury, however, had no part in it. My faculties were chained up in wonder and awe. Just then, I was unable to speak. I looked at my friend with an air of inquisitiveness, and pointed at the roll. He comprehended my inquiry, and answered me with looks of gloomy acquiescence. After some time, my thoughts found their way to my lips.</P>
<P>Such then were the acts of my brother. Such were his words. For this he was condemned to die: To die upon the gallows! A fate, cruel and unmerited! And is it so? continued I, struggling for utterance, which this new idea made difficult; is he—dead!</P>
<P>"No. He is alive. There could be no doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as to the cause of these excesses. They originated in sudden madness; but that madness continues, and he is condemned to perpetual imprisonment."</P>
<P>"Madness, say you? Are you sure? Were not these sights, and these sounds, really seen and heard?"</P>
<P>My uncle was surprized at my question. He looked at me with apparent inquietude. "Can you doubt," said he, "that these were illusions! Does heaven, think you, interfere for such ends?"</P>
<P>"O no; I think it not. Heaven cannot stimu∣late to such unheard of outrage. The agent was not good, but evil."</P>
<P>"Nay, my dear girl," said my friend, "lay aside these fancies. Neither angel nor devil had any part in this affair."</P>
<P>"You misunderstand me," I answered; "I be∣lieve the agency to be external and real, but not supernatural."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" said he, in an accent of surprize "Whom do you then suppose to be the agent?"</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="219"/>"I know not. All is wildering conjecture. I cannot forget Carwin. I cannot banish the suspi∣cion that he was the setter of these snares. But how can we suppose it to be madness? Did insanity ever before assume this form?"</P>
<P>"Frequently. The illusion, in this case, was more dreadful in its consequences, than any that has come to my knowledge; but, I repeat that similar illusions are not rare. Did you never hear of an instance which occurred in your mother's family?"</P>
<P>"No. I beseech you relate it. My grandfa∣ther's death I have understood to have been extra∣ordinary, but I know not in what respect. A bro∣ther, to whom he was much attached, died in his youth, and this, as I have heard, influenced, in some remarkable way, the fate of my grandfather; but I am unacquainted with particulars."</P>
<P>"On the death of that brother," resumed my friend, "my father was seized with dejection, which was found to flow from two sources. He not only grieved for the loss of a friend, but enter∣tained the belief that his own death would be ine∣vitably consequent on that of his brother. He waited from day to day in expectation of the stroke which he predicted was speedily to fall upon him. Gradually, however, he recovered his cheerfulness and confidence. He married, and performed his part in the world with spirit and activity. At the end of twenty-one years it happened that he spent the summer with his family at an house which he possessed on the sea coast in Cornwall. It was at no great distance from a cliff which overhung the ocean, and rose into the air to a great height. The summit was level and secure, and easily as∣cended on the land side. The company frequently
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
repaired hither in clear weather, invited by its pure airs and extensive prospects. One evening in June my father, with his wife and some friends, chanc∣ed to be on this spot. Every one was happy, and my father's imagination seemed particularly alive to the grandeur of the scenery.</P>
<P>"Suddenly, however, his limbs trembled and his features betrayed alarm. He threw himself into the attitude of one listening. He gazed earnestly in a direction in which nothing was visible to his friends. This lasted for a minute; then turning to his companions, he told them that his brother had just delivered to him a summons, which must be instantly obeyed. He then took an hasty and solemn leave of each person, and, before their sur∣prize would allow them to understand the scene, he rushed to the edge of the cliff, threw himself headlong, and was seen no more.</P>
<P>"In the course of my practice in the German army, many cases, equally remarkable, have oc∣curred. Unquestionably the illusions were mania∣cal, though the vulgar thought otherwise. They are all reducible to one class,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mania Mutabilis. See Darwin's Zoonomia, vol. ii. Class III. 1. 2. where similar cases are stated.</NOTE> and are not more dif∣ficult of explication and cure than most affections of our frame."</P>
<P>This opinion my uncle endeavoured, by various means, to impress upon me. I listened to his reason∣ings and illustrations with silent respect. My asto∣nishment was great on finding proofs of an influ∣ence of which I had supposed there were no exam∣ples; but I was far from accounting for appearances in my uncle's manner. Ideas thronged into my mind which I was unable to disjoin or to regulate
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
I reflected that this madness, if madness it were, had affected Pleyel and myself as well as Wieland. Pleyel had heard a mysterious voice. I had seen and heard. A form had showed itself to me as well as to Wieland. The disclosure had been made in the same spot. The appearance was equally complete and equally prodigious in both instances. Whatever supposition I should adopt, had I not equal reason to tremble? What was my security against influences equally terrific and equally irre∣sistable?</P>
<P>It would be vain to attempt to describe the state of mind which this idea produced. I wondered at the change which a moment had affected in my bro∣ther's condition. Now was I stupified with ten∣fold wonder in contemplating myself. Was I not likewise transformed from rational and human into a creature of nameless and fearful attributes? Was I not transported to the brink of the same abyss? Ere a new day should come, my hands might be embrued in blood, and my remaining life be con∣signed to a dungeon and chains.</P>
<P>With moral sensibility like mine, no wonder that this new dread was more insupportable than the anguish I had lately endured. Grief carries its own antidote along with it. When thought becomes merely a vehicle of pain, its progress must be stop∣ped. Death is a cure which nature or ourselves must administer: To this cure I now looked for∣ward with gloomy satisfaction.</P>
<P>My silence could not conceal from my uncle the state of my thoughts. He made unwearied efforts to divert my attention from views so pregnant with danger. His efforts, aided by time, were in some measure successful. Confidence in the strength of my resolution, and in the healthful state of my fa∣culties,
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
was once more revived. I was able to de∣vote my thoughts to my brother's state, and the causes of this disasterous proceeding.</P>
<P>My opinions were the sport of eternal change. Some times I conceived the apparition to be more than human. I had no grounds on which to build a disbelief. I could not deny faith to the evidence of my religion; the testimony of men was loud and unanimous: both these concurred to persuade me that evil spirits existed, and that their energy was frequently exerted in the system of the world.</P>
<P>These ideas connected themselves with the image of Carwin. Where is the proof, said I, that daemons may not be subjected to the controul of men? This truth may be distorted and debased in the minds of the ignorant. The dogmas of the vulgar, with regard to this subject, are glaringly absurd; but though these may justly be neglected by the wise, we are scarcely justified in totally re∣jecting the possibility that men may obtain super∣natural aid.</P>
<P>The dreams of superstition are worthy of con∣tempt. Witchcraft, its instruments and miracles, the compact ratified by a bloody signature, the ap∣paratus of sulpherous smells and thundering ex∣plosions, are monstrous and chimerical. These have no part in the scene over which the genius of Carwin presides. That conscious beings, dissimilar from human, but moral and voluntary agents as we are, some where exist, can scarcely be denied. That their aid may be employed to benign or malignant purposes, cannot be disproved.</P>
<P>Darkness rests upon the designs of this man The extent of his power is unknown; but is their not evidence that it has been now exerted?</P>
<P>I recurred to my own experience. Here Car∣win
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
had actually appeared upon the stage; but this was in a human character. A voice and a form were discovered; but one was apparently exerted, and the other disclosed, not to befriend, but to coun∣teract Carwin's designs. There were tokens of hostility, and not of alliance, between them. Car∣win was the miscreant whose projects were resisted by a minister of heaven. How can this be re∣conciled to the stratagem which ruined my brother? There the agency was at once preternatural and malignant.</P>
<P>The recollection of this fact led my thoughts into a new channel. The malignity of that influence which governed my brother had hitherto been no subject of doubt. His wife and children were de∣stroyed; they had expired in agony and fear; yet was it indisputably certain that their murderer was criminal? He was acquitted at the tribunal of his own conscience; his behaviour at his trial and since, was faithfully reported to me; appearances were uniform; not for a moment did he lay aside the majesty of virtue; he repelled all invectives by ap∣pealing to the deity, and to the tenor of his past life; surely there was truth in this appeal: none but a command from heaven could have swayed his will; and nothing but unerring proof of divine approba∣tion could sustain his mind in its present elevation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH, for some time, was the course of my me∣ditations. My weakness, and my aversion to be pointed at as an object of surprize or compassion prevented me from going into public. I studiously avoided the visits of those who came to express the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sympathy, or gratify their curiosity. My uncle was my principal companion. Nothing more power∣fully tended to console me than his conversation.</P>
<P>With regard to Pleyel, my feelings seemed to have undergone a total revolution. It often hap∣pens that one passion supplants another. Late dis∣asters had rent my heart, and now that the wound was in some degree closed, the love which I had cherished for this man seemed likewise to have va∣nished.</P>
<P>Hitherto, indeed, I had had no cause for despair▪ I was innocent of that offence which had estranged him from my presence. I might reasonably expect that my innocence would at some time be irresistably demonstrated, and his affection for me be revived with his esteem. Now my aversion to be though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> culpable by him continued, but was unattended with the same impatience. I desired the removal of his suspicions, not for the sake of regaining his love, but because I delighted in the veneration of so excellent a man, and because he himself would derive pleasure from conviction of my integrity.</P>
<P>My uncle had early informed me that Pleyel and he had seen each other, since the return of the latter
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
from Europe. Amidst the topics of their conver∣sation, I discovered that Pleyel had carefully omitted the mention of those events which had drawn upon me so much abhorrence. I could not account for his silence on this subject. Perhaps time or some new discovery had altered or shaken his opinion. Perhaps he was unwilling, though I were guilty, to injure me in the opinion of my venerable kinsman. I understood that he had frequently visited me dur∣ing my disease, had watched many successive nights by my beside, and manifested the utmost anxiety on my account.</P>
<P>The journey which he was preparing to take, at the termination of our last interview, the catastrophe of the ensuing night induced him to delay. The motives of this journey I had, till now, totally mis∣taken. They were explained to me by my uncle, whose tale excited my astonishment without awa∣kening my regret. In a different state of mind, it would have added unspeakably to my distress, but now it was more a source of pleasure than pain. This, perhaps, is not the least extraordinary of the facts contained in this narrative. It will excite less wonder when I add, that my indifference was tem∣porary, and that the lapse of a few days shewed me that my feelings were deadened for a time, rather than finally extinguished.</P>
<P>Theresa de Stolberg was alive. She had con∣ceived the resolution of seeking her lover in Ame∣rica. To conceal her flight, she had caused the report of her death to be propagated. She put her∣self under the conduct of Bertrand, the faithful ser∣vant of Pleyel. The pacquet which the latter re∣ceived from the hands of his servant, contained the tidings of her safe arrival at Boston, and to meet her there was the purpose of his journey.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="226"/>This discovery had set this man's character in a new light. I had mistaken the heroism of friend∣ship for the phrenzy of love. He who had gained my affections, may be supposed to have previously entitled himself to my reverence; but the levity which had formerly characterized the behaviour of this man, tended to obscure the greatness of his sentiments. I did not fail to remark, that since this lady was still alive, the voice in the temple which asserted her death, must either have been intended to deceive, or have been itself deceived. The latter supposition was inconsistent with the notion of a spiritual, and the former with that of a benevolent being.</P>
<P>When my disease abated, Pleyel had forborne his visits, and had lately set out upon this journey. This amounted to a proof that my guilt was still believed by him. I was grieved for his errors, but trusted that my vindication would, sooner or later, be made.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, tumultuous thoughts were again set afloat by a proposal made to me by my uncle. He imagined that new airs would restore my languish∣ing constitution, and a varied succession of objects tend to repair the shock which my mind had re∣ceived. For this end, he proposed to me to take up my abode with him in France or Italy.</P>
<P>At a more prosperous period, this scheme would have pleased for its own sake. Now my heart sickened at the prospect of nature. The world of man was shrowded in misery and blood, and con∣stituted a loathsome spectacle. I willingly closed my eyes in sleep, and regretted that the respite it afforded me was so short. I marked with satis∣faction the progress of decay in my frame, and con∣sented to live, merely in the hope that the course of nature would speedily relieve me from the bur∣then.
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
Nevertheless, as he persisted in his scheme, I concurred in it merely because he was entitled to my gratitude, and because my refusal gave him pain.</P>
<P>No sooner was he informed of my consent, than he told me I must make immediate preparation to embark, as the ship in which he had engaged a passage would be ready to depart in three days. This expedition was unexpected. There was an impatience in his manner when he urged the ne∣cessity of dispatch that excited my surprize. When I questioned him as to the cause of this haste, he generally stated reasons which, at that time, I could not deny to be plausible; but which, on the review, appeared insufficient. I suspected that the true mo∣tives were concealed, and believed that these motives had some connection with my brother's destiny.</P>
<P>I now recollected that the information respecting Wieland which had, from time to time, been im∣parted to me, was always accompanied with airs of reserve and mysteriousness. What had appeared sufficiently explicit at the time it was uttered, I now remembered to have been faltering and ambiguous. I was resolved to remove my doubts, by visiting the unfortunate man in his dungeon.</P>
<P>Heretofore the idea of this visit had occurred to me; but the horrors of his dwelling-place, his wild yet placid physiognomy, his neglected locks, the letters which constrained his limbs, terrible as they were in description, how could I endure to behold!</P>
<P>Now, however, that I was preparing to take an everlasting farewell of my country, now that an ocean was henceforth to separate me from him, how could I part without an interview? I would examine his situation with my own eyes. I would know whether the representations which had
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
been made to me were true. Perhaps the sight of the sister whom he was wont to love with a passion more than fraternal, might have an auspicious in∣fluence on his malady.</P>
<P>Having formed this resolution, I waited to com∣municate it to Mr. Cambridge. I was aware that, without his concurrence, I could not hope to carry it into execution, and could discover no objection to which it was liable. If I had not been deceived as to his condition, no inconvenience could arise from this proceeding. His consent, therefore, would be the test of his sincerity.</P>
<P>I seized this opportunity to state my wishes on this head. My suspicions were confirmed by the manner in which my request affected him. After some pause, in which his countenance betrayed every mark of perplexity, he said to me, "Why would you pay this visit? What useful purpose can it serve?"</P>
<P>"We are preparing," said I, "to leave the country forever: What kind of being should I be to leave behind me a brother in calamity without even a parting interview? Indulge me for three minutes in the sight of him. My heart will be much easier after I have looked at him, and shed a few tears in his presence."</P>
<P>"I believe otherwise. The sight of him would only augment your distress, without contributing, in any degree, to his benefit."</P>
<P>"I know not that," returned I. "Surely the sympathy of his sister, proofs that her tenderness is as lively as ever, must be a source of satisfaction to him. At present he must regard all mankind as his enemies and calumniators. His sister he, pro∣bably, conceives to partake in the general infatua∣tion, and to join in the cry of abhorrence that is
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
raised against him. To be undeceived in this re∣spect, to be assured that, however I may impute his conduct to delusion, I still retain all my former affection for his person, and veneration for the pu∣rity of his motives, cannot but afford him pleasure. When he hears that I have left the country, with∣out even the ceremonious attention of a visit, what will he think of me? His magnanimity may hin∣der him from repining, but he will surely consider my behaviour as savage and unfeeling. Indeed, dear Sir, I must pay this visit. To embark with you without paying it, will be impossible. It may be no service to him, but will enable me to acquit myself of what I cannot but esteem a duty. Be∣sides," continued I, "if it be a mere fit of insanity that has seized him, may not my presence chance to have a salutary influence? The mere sight of me, it is not impossible, may rectify his perceptions."</P>
<P>"Ay," said my uncle, with some eagerness; "it is by no means impossible that your interview may have that effect; and for that reason, beyond all others, would I dissuade you from it."</P>
<P>I expressed my surprize at this declaration. "Is it not to be desired that an error so fatal as this should be rectified?"</P>
<P>"I wonder at your question. Reflect on the consequences of this error. Has he not destroyed the wife whom he loved, the children whom he idolized? What is it that enables him to bear the remembrance, but the belief that he acted as his duty enjoined? Would you rashly bereave him of this belief? Would you restore him to himself, and convince him that he was instigated to this dreadful outrage by a perversion of his organs, or a delusion from hell?</P>
<P>"Now his visions are joyous and elate. He con∣ceives
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
himself to have reached a loftier degree of virtue, than any other human being. The merit of his sacrifice is only enhanced in the eyes of supe∣rior beings, by the detestation that pursues him here, and the sufferings to which he is condemned. The belief that even his sister has deserted him, and goes over to his enemies, adds to his sublimity of feel∣ings, and his confidence in divine approbation and future recompense.</P>
<P>"Let him be undeceived in this respect, and what floods of despair and of horror will overwhelm him. Instead of glowing approbation and serene hope, will he not hate and torture himself? Self-violence, or a phrenzy far more savage and destructive than this, may be expected to succeed. I beseech you therefore, to relinquish this scheme. If you calmly reflect upon it, you will discover that your duty lies in carefully shunning him."</P>
<P>Mr. Cambridge's reasonings suggested views to my understanding, that had not hitherto occurred. I could not but admit their validity, but they shew∣ed, in a new light, the depth of that misfortune in which my brother was plunged. I was silent and irresolute.</P>
<P>Presently, I considered, that whether Wieland was a maniac, a faithful servant of his God, the victim of hellish illusions, or the dupe of human imposture, was by no means certain. In this state of my mind it became me to be silent during the visit that I projected. This visit should be brief; I should be satisfied merely to snatch a look at him. Admitting that a change in his opinions were not to be desired, there was no danger from the con∣duct which I should pursue, that this change should be wrought.</P>
<P>But I could not conquer my uncle's aversion to
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
this scheme. Yet I persisted, and he found that to make me voluntarily relinquish it, it was necessary to be more explicit than he had hitherto been. He took both my hands, and anxiously examining my countenance as he spoke, "Clara," said he, "this visit must not be paid. We must hasten with the utmost expedition from this shore. It is folly to conceal the truth from you, and, since it is only by disclosing the truth that you can be prevailed upon to lay aside this project, the truth shall be told.</P>
<P>"O my dear girl!" continued he with increasing energy in his accent, "your brother's phrenzy is, indeed, stupendous and frightful. The soul that formerly actuated his frame has disappeared. The same form remains; but the wise and benevolent Wieland is no more. A fury that is rapacious of blood, that lifts his strength almost above that of mortals, that bends all his energies to the destruc∣tion of whatever was once dear to him, possesses him wholly.</P>
<P>"You must not enter his dungeon; his eyes will no sooner be fixed upon you, than an exertion of his force will be made. He will shake off his fetters in a moment, and rush upon you. No interposition will then be strong or quick enough to save you.</P>
<P>"The phantom that has urged him to the mur∣der of Catharine and her children is not yet ap∣peased. Your life, and that of Pleyel, are exacted from him by this imaginary being. He is eager to comply with this demand. Twice he has escaped from his prison. The first time, he no sooner found himself at liberty, than he hasted to Pleyel's house. It being midnight, the latter was in bed. Wieland penetrated unobserved to his chamber, and opened
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
his curtain. Happily, Pleyel awoke at the critical moment, and escaped the fury of his kinsman, by leaping from his chamber-window into the court. Happily, he reached the ground without injury. Alarms were given, and after diligent search, your brother was found in a chamber of your house, whither, no doubt, he had sought you.</P>
<P>"His chains, and the watchfulness of his guards, were redoubled; but again, by some miracle, he re∣stored himself to liberty. He was now incautiously apprized of the place of your abode: and had not information of his escape been instantly given, your death would have been added to the number of his atrocious acts.</P>
<P>"You now see the danger of your project. You must not only forbear to visit him, but if you would save him from the crime of embruing his hands in your blood, you must leave the country. There is no hope that his malady will end but with his life, and no precaution will ensure your safety, but that of placing the ocean between you.</P>
<P>"I confess I came over with an intention to re∣side among you, but these disasters have changed my views. Your own safety and my happiness require that you should accompany me in my re∣turn, and I entreat you to give your cheerful con∣currence to this measure."</P>
<P>After these representations from my uncle, it was impossible to retain my purpose. I readily consented to seclude myself from Wieland's presence. I like∣wise acquiesced in the proposal to go to Europe; not that I ever expected to arrive there, but be∣cause, since my principles forbad me to assail my own life, change had some tendency to make sup∣portable the few days which disease should spare to me.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="233"/>What a tale had thus been unfolded! I was hunted to death, not by one whom my misconduct had exasperated, who was conscious of illicit mo∣tives, and who sought his end by circumvention and surprize; but by one who deemed himself commis∣sioned for this act by heaven; who regarded this ca∣reer of horror as the last refinement of virtue; whose implacability was proportioned to the reverence and love which he felt for me, and who was inaccessible to the fear of punishment and ignominy!</P>
<P>In vain should I endeavour to stay his hand by urging the claims of a sister or friend: these were his only reasons for pursuing my destruction. Had I been a stranger to his blood; had I been the most worthless of human kind; my safety had not been endangered.</P>
<P>Surely, said I, my fate is without example. The phrenzy which is charged upon my brother, must belong to myself. My foe is manacled and guarded; but I derive no security from these restraints. I live not in a community of savages; yet, whether I sit or walk, go into crouds, or hide myself in solitude, my life is marked for a prey to inhuman violence; I am in perpetual danger of perishing; of perishing under the grasp of a brother!</P>
<P>I recollected the omens of this destiny; I remem∣bered the gulf to which my brother's invitation had conducted me; I remembered that, when on the brink of danger, the author of my peril was de∣picted by my fears in his form: Thus realized, were the creatures of prophetic sleep, and of wake∣ful terror!</P>
<P>These images were unavoidably connected with that of Carwin. In this paroxysm of distress, my attention fastened on him as the grand deceiver; the
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
author of this black conspiracy; the intelligence that governed in this storm.</P>
<P>Some relief is afforded in the midst of suffering, when its author is discovered or imagined; and an object found on which we may pour out our indig∣nation and our vengeance. I ran over the events that had taken place since the origin of our intercourse with him, and reflected on the tenor of that descrip∣tion which was received from Ludloe. Mixed up with notions of supernatural agency, were the vehe∣ment suspicions which I entertained, that Carwin was the enemy whose machinations had destroyed us.</P>
<P>I thirsted for knowledge and for vengeance. I regarded my hasty departure with reluctance, since it would remove me from the means by which this knowledge might be obtained, and this vengeance gratified. This departure was to take place in two days. At the end of two days I was to bid an eternal adieu to my native country. Should I not pay a parting visit to the scene of these disasters? Should I not bedew with my tears the graves of my sister and her children? Should I not explore their desolate habitation, and gather from the sight of its walls and furniture food for my eternal melan∣choly?</P>
<P>This suggestion was succeeded by a secret shud∣dering. Some disastrous influence appeared to overhang the scene. How many memorials should I meet with serving to recall the images of those I had lost!</P>
<P>I was tempted to relinquish my design, when it occurred to me that I had left among my papers a journal of transactions in short-hand. I was em∣ployed in this manuscript on that night when Pleyel's incautious curiosity tempted him to look over my
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
shoulder. I was then recording my adventure in <HI>the recess,</HI> an imperfect sight of which led him into such fatal errors.</P>
<P>I had regulated the disposition of all my proper∣ty. This manuscript, however, which contained the most secret transactions of my life, I was desi∣rous of destroying. For this end I must return to my house, and this I immediately determined to do.</P>
<P>I was not willing to expose myself to opposition from my friends, by mentioning my design; I there∣fore bespoke the use of Mr. Hallet's chaise, under pretence of enjoying an airing, as the day was re∣markably bright.</P>
<P>This request was gladly complied with, and I directed the servant to conduct me to Mettingen. I dismissed him at the gate, intending to use, in re∣turning, a carriage belonging to my brother.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE inhabitants of the HUT received me with a mixture of joy and surprize. Their homely wel∣come, and their artless sympathy, were grateful to my feelings. In the midst of their inquiries, as to my health, they avoided all allusions to the source of my malady. They were honest creatures, and I loved them well. I participated in the tears which they shed when I mentioned to them my speedy de∣parture for Europe, and promised to acquaint them with my welfare during my long absence.</P>
<P>They expressed great surprize when I informed them of my intention to visit my cottage. Alarm and foreboding overspread their features, and they attempted to dissuade me from visiting an house which they firmly believed to be haunted by a thou∣sand ghastly apparitions.</P>
<P>Those apprehensions, however, had no power over my conduct. I took an irregular path which led me to my own house. All was vacant and for∣lorn. A small enclosure, near which the path led, was the burying-ground belonging to the family. This I was obliged to pass. Once I had intended to enter it, and ponder on the emblems and inscrip∣tions which my uncle had caused to be made on the tombs of Catharine and her children; but now my heart faltered as I approached, and I hastened forward, that distance might conceal it from my view.</P>
<P>When I approached the recess, my heart again sunk. I averted my eyes, and left it behind me as
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
quickly as possible. Silence reigned through my habitation, and a darkness which closed doors and shutters produced. Every object was connected with mine or my brother's history. I passed the entry, mounted the stair, and unlocked the door of my chamber. It was with difficulty that I curbed my fancy and smothered my fears. Slight movements and casual sounds were transformed into beckoning shadows and calling shapes.</P>
<P>I proceeded to the closet. I opened and looked round it with fearfulness. All things were in their accustomed order. I sought and found the manu∣script where I was used to deposit it. This being secured, there was nothing to detain me; yet I stood and contemplated awhile the furniture and walls of my chamber. I remembered how long this apart∣ment had been a sweet and tranquil asylum; I com∣pared its former state with its present dreariness, and reflected that I now beheld it for the last time.</P>
<P>Here it was that the incomprehensible behaviour of Carwin was witnessed: this the stage on which that enemy of man shewed himself for a moment unmasked. Here the menaces of murder were wafted to my ear; and here these menaces were executed.</P>
<P>These thoughts had a tendency to take from me my self-command. My feeble limbs refused to sup∣port me, and I sunk upon a chair. Incoherent and half-articulate exclamations escaped my lips. The name of Carwin was uttered, and eternal woes, woes like that which his malice had entailed upon us, were heaped upon him. I invoked all-seeing heaven to drag to light and to punish this betrayer, and accused its providence for having thus long delayed the retribution that was due to so enormous a guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="238"/>I have said that the window shutters were closed. A feeble light, however, found entrance through the orevices. A small window illuminated the closet, and the door being closed, a dim ray streamed through the key-hole. A kind of twilight was thus created, sufficient for the purposes of vision; but, at the same time, involving all minuter objects in obscurity.</P>
<P>This darkness suited the colour of my thoughts. I sickened at the remembrance of the past. The prospect of the future excited my loathing. I mut∣tered in a low voice, Why should I live longer? Why should I drag a miserable being? All, for whom I ought to live, have perished. Am I not myself hunted to death?</P>
<P>At that moment, my despair suddenly became vigorous. My nerves were no longer unstrung. My powers, that had long been deadened, were re∣vived. My bosom swelled with a sudden energy, and the conviction darted through my mind, that to end my torments was, at once, practicable and wise.</P>
<P>I knew how to find way to the recesses of life. I could use a lancet with some skill, and could dis∣tinguish between vein and artery. By piercing deep into the latter, I should shun the evils which the future had in store for me, and take refuge from my woes in quiet death.</P>
<P>I started on my feet, for my feebleness was gone, and hasted to the closet. A lancet and other small instruments were preserved in a case which I had deposited here. Inattentive as I was to foreign con∣siderations, my ears were still open to any sound of mysterious import that should occur. I thought I heard a step in the entry. My purpose was sus∣pended, and I cast an eager glance at my chamber
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
door, which was open. No one appeared, unless the shadow which I discerned upon the floor, was the outline of a man. If it were, I was authorized to suspect that some one was posted close to the en∣trance, who possibly had overheard my exclama∣tions.</P>
<P>My teeth chattered, and a wild confusion took place of my momentary calm. Thus it was when a terrifie visage had disclosed itself on a former night. Thus it was when the evil destiny of Wieland as∣sumed the lineaments of something human. What horrid apparition was preparing to blast my sight?</P>
<P>Still I listened and gazed. Not long, for the shadow moved; a foot, unshapely and huge, was thrust forward; a form advanced from its conceal∣ment, and stalked into the room. It was Carwin!</P>
<P>While I had breath I shrieked. While I had power over my muscles, I motioned with my hand that he should vanish. My exertions could not last long; I sunk into a fit.</P>
<P>O that this grateful oblivion had lasted for ever! Too quickly I recovered my senses. The power of distinct vision was no sooner restored to me, than this hateful form again presented itself, and I once more relapsed.</P>
<P>A second time, untoward nature recalled me from the sleep of death. I found myself stretched upon the bed. When I had power to look up, I re∣membered only that I had cause to fear. My dis∣tempered fancy fashioned to itfelf no distinguishable image. I threw a languid glance round me; once more my eyes lighted upon Carwin.</P>
<P>He was seated on the floor, his back rested against the wall, his knees were drawn up, and his face was buried in his hands. That his station was at some distance, that his attitude was not menacing, that
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
his ominous visage was concealed, may account for my now escaping a shock, violent as those which were past. I withdrew my eyes, but was not again deserted by my senses.</P>
<P>On perceiving that I had recovered my sensibility, he lifted his head. This motion attracted my attention. His countenance was mild, but sorrow and astonishment sat upon his features. I averted my eyes and feebly exclaimed—"O! fly—fly far and for ever!—I cannot behold you and live!"</P>
<P>He did not rise upon his feet, but olasped his hands, and said in a tone of deprecation—" I will fly. I am become a fiend, the sight of whom de∣stroys. Yet tell me my offence! You have linked curses with my name; you ascribe to me a malice monstrous and infernal. I look around; all is loneliness and desert! This house and your bro∣ther's are solitary and dismantled! You die away at the sight of me! My fear whispers that some deed of horror has been perpetrated; that I am the undesigning cause."</P>
<P>What language was this? Had he not avowed himself a ravisher? Had not this chamber witnessed his atrocious purposes? I besought him with new vehemence to go.</P>
<P>He lifted his eyes—"Great heaven! what have I done? I think I know the extent of my offences. I have acted, but my actions have possibly effect∣ed more than I designed. This fear has brought me back from my retreat. I come to repair the evil of which my rashness was the cause, and to prevent more evil. I come to confess my errors."</P>
<P>"Wretch!" I cried when my suffocating emo∣tions would permit me to speak, "the ghosts of my sister and her children, do they not rise to accuse thee? Who was it that blasted the intellects of
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
Wieland? Who was it that urged him to fury, and guided him to murder? Who, but thou and the devil, with whom thou art confederated?"</P>
<P>At these words a new spirit pervaded his coun∣tenance. His eyes once more appealed to heaven. "If I have memory, if I have being, I am inno∣cent. I intended no ill; but my folly, indirectly and remotely, may have caused it; but what words are these! Your brother lunatic! His children dead!"</P>
<P>What should I infer from this deportment? Was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he ignorance which these words implied real or pretended?—Yet how could I imagine a mere hu∣man agency in these events? But if the influence was preternatural or maniacal in my brother's case, they must be equally so in my own. Then I re∣membered that the voice exerted, was to save me from Carwin's attempts. These ideas tended to abate my abhorrence of this man, and to detect the absurdity of my accusations.</P>
<P>"Alas!" said I, "I have no one to accuse. Leave me to my fate. Fly from a scene stained with cruelty; devoted to despair."</P>
<P>Carwin stood for a time musing and mournful. At length he said, "What has happened? I came to expiate my crimes: let me know them in their full extent. I have horrible forebodings! What has happened?"</P>
<P>I was silent; but recollecting the intimation gi∣ven by this man when he was detected in my clo∣set, which implied some knowledge of that power which interfered in my favor, I eagerly inquired, "What was that voice which called upon me to hold when. I attempted to open the closet? What face was that which I saw at the bottom of the stairs? Answer me truly."</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242"/>"I came to confess the truth. Your allusions are horrible and strange. Perhaps I have but faint conceptions of the evils which my infatuation has produced; but what remains I will perform. It was <HI>my voice</HI> that you heard! It was <HI>my face</HI> that you saw!"</P>
<P>For a moment I doubted whether my remem∣brance of events were not confused. How could he be at once stationed at my shoulder and shut up in my closet? How could he stand near me and yet be invisible? But if Carwin's were the thril∣ling voice and the fiery visage which I had heard and seen, then was he the prompter of my brother▪ and the author of these dismal outrages.</P>
<P>Once more I averted my eyes and struggled for speech. "Begone! thou man of mischief! Re∣morseless and implacable miscreant! begone!"</P>
<P>"I will obey," said he in a disconsolate voice; "yet, wretch as I am, am I unworthy to repair the evils that I have committed? I came as a re∣pentant criminal. It is you whom I have injured, and at your bar am I willing to appear, and confess and expiate my crimes. I have deceived you: I have sported with your terrors: I have plotted to destroy your reputation. I come now to remove your errors; to set you beyond the reach of similar fears; to rebuild your fame as far as I am able.</P>
<P>"This is the amount of my guilt, and this the fruit of my remorse. Will you not hear me? Lis∣ten to my confession, and then denounce punish∣ment. All I ask is a patient audience."</P>
<P>"What!" I replied, "was not thine the voice that commanded my brother to imbrue his hands in the blood of his children—to strangle that angel of sweetness his wife? Has he not vowed my death, and the death of Pleyel, at thy bidding? Hast thou
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
not made him the butcher of his family; changed him who was the glory of his species into worse than brute; robbed him of reason, and consigned the rest of his days to fetters and stripes?"</P>
<P>Carwin's eyes glared, and his limbs were petri∣fied at this intelligence. No words were requisite to prove him guiltless of these enormities: at the time, however, I was nearly insensible to these ex∣culpatory tokens. He walked to the further end of the room, and having recovered some degree of composure, he spoke—</P>
<P>"I am not this villain; I have slain no one; I have prompted none to slay; I have handled a tool of wonderful efficacy without malignant intentions, but without caution; ample will be the punishment of my temerity, if my conduct has contributed to this evil." He paused.—</P>
<P>I likewise was silent. I struggled to command myself so far as to listen to the tale which he should tell. Observing this, he continued—</P>
<P>"You are not apprized of the existence of a power which I possess. I know not by what name to call it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Biloquium,</HI> or ventrilocution. Sound is varied according to the variations of direction and distance. The art of the ventriloquist consists in modifying his voice according to all these variations, without changing his place. See the work of the Abbe de la Chappelle, in which are accurately recorded the performances of one of these artists, and some ingenious, though unsatisfactory speculations are given on the means by which the effects are produced. This power is, perhaps, given by nature, but is doubtless improvable, if not acquirable, by art. It may, possibly, consist in an unusual flexibility or ex∣ertion of the bottom of the tongue and the uvula. That speech is producible by these alone must be granted, since anatomists mention two instances of persons speaking without a tongue. In one case, the organ was originally wanting, but its place was supplied by a small tubercle, and the uvula was perfect. In the other, the tongue was destroyed by disease, but proba∣bly a small part of it remained.</P><P>This power is difficult to explain, but the fact is undeniable. Experience shews that the human voice can imitate the voice of all men and of all inferior animals. The sound of musical instruments, and even noises from the contact of inanimate substances, have been accurately imitated. The mimicry of animals is notorious; and Dr. Burney (Musical Travels) men∣tions one who imitated a flute and violin, so as to deceive even his ears.</P></NOTE> It enables me to mimic exactly the
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
voice of another, and to modify the sound so that it shall appear to come from what quarter, and be uttered at what distance I please.</P>
<P>"I know not that every one possesses this power. Perhaps, though a casual position of my organs in my youth shewed me that I possessed it, it is an art which may be taught to all. Would to God I had died unknowing of the secret! It has produced no∣thing but degradation and calamity.</P>
<P>"For a time the possession of so potent and stu∣pendous an endowment elated me with pride. Un∣fortified by principle, subjected to poverty, stimu∣lated by headlong passions, I made this powerful engine subservient to the supply of my wants, and the gratification of my vanity. I shall not mention how diligently I cultivated this gift, which seemed capable of unlimited improvement; nor detail the various occasions on which it was successfully ex∣erted to lead superstition, conquer avarice, or excite awe.</P>
<P>"I left America, which is my native soil, in my youth. I have been engaged in various scenes of life, in which my peculiar talent has been exercis∣ed with more or less success. I was finally betray∣ed by one who called himself my friend, into acts which cannot be justified, though they are suscep∣tible of apology.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="245"/>"The perfidy of this man compelled me to with∣draw from Europe. I returned to my native coun∣try, uncertain whether silence and obscurity would save me from his malice. I resided in the purlieus of the city. I put on the garb and assumed the manners of a clown.</P>
<P>"My chief recreation was walking. My prin∣cipal haunts were the lawns and gardens of Met∣tingen. In this delightful region the luxuriances of nature had been chastened by judicious art, and each successive contemplation unfolded new en∣chantments.</P>
<P>"I was studious of seclusion: I was satiated with the intercourse of mankind, and discretion re∣quired me to shun their intercourse. For these rea∣sons I long avoided the observation of your family, and chiefly visited these precincts at night.</P>
<P>"I was never weary of admiring the position and ornaments of <HI>the temple.</HI> Many a night have I passed under its roof, revolving no pleasing me∣ditations. When, in my frequent rambles, I per∣ceived this apartment was occupied, I gave a dif∣ferent direction to my steps. One evening, when a shower had just passed, judging by the silence that no one was within, I ascended to this building. Glancing carelessly round, I perceived an open let∣ter on the pedestal. To read it was doubtless an offence against politeness. Of this offence, how∣ever, I was guilty.</P>
<P>"Scarcely had I gone half through when I was alarmed by the approach of your brother. To scramble down the cliff on the opposite side was impracticable. I was unprepared to meet a stran∣ger. Besides the aukwardness attending such an interview in these circumstances, concealment was necessary to my safety. A thousand times had I
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
vowed never again to employ the dangerous talent which I possessed; but such was the force of habit and the influence of present convenience, that I used this method of arresting his progress and lead∣ing him back to the house, with his errand, what∣ever it was, unperformed. I had often caught parts, from my station below, of your conversation in this place, and was well acquainted with the voice of your sister.</P>
<P>"Some weeks after this I was again quietly seat∣ed in this recess. The lateness of the hour secured me, as I thought, from all interruption. In this, however, I was mistaken, for Wieland and Pleyel, as I judged by their voices, earnest in dispute, as∣cended the hill.</P>
<P>"I was not sensible that any inconvenience could possibly have flowed from my former exertion; yet it was followed with compunction, because it was a deviation from a path which I had assigned to myself. Now my aversion to this means of escape was enforced by an unauthorized curiosity, and by the knowledge of a bushy hollow on the edge of the hill, where I should be safe from discovery. Into this hollow I thrust myself.</P>
<P>"The propriety of removal to Europe was the question eagerly discussed. Pleyel intimated that his anxiety to go was augmented by the silence of Theresa de Stolberg. The temptation to interfere in this dispute was irresistible. In vain I contended with inveterate habits. I disguised to myself the impropriety of my conduct, by recollecting the benefits which it might produce. Pleyel's proposal was unwise, yet it was enforced with plausible ar∣guments and indefatigable zeal. Your brother might be puzzled and wearied, but could not be con∣vinced. I conceived that to terminate the contro∣versy
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
in favor of the latter was conferring a benefit on all parties. For this end I profited by an open∣ing in the conversation, and assured them of Ca∣tharine's irreconcilable aversion to the scheme, and of the death of the Saxon baroness. The latter event was merely a conjecture, but rendered ex∣tremely probable by Pleyel's representations. My purpose, you need not be told, was effected.</P>
<P>"My passion for mystery, and a species of im∣posture, which I deemed harmless, was thus awak∣ened afresh. This second lapse into error made my recovery more difficult. I cannot convey to you an adequate idea of the kind of gratification which I derived from these exploits; yet I meditat∣ed nothing. My views were bounded to the passing moment, and commonly suggested by the momen∣tary exigence.</P>
<P>"I must not conceal any thing. Your princi∣ples teach you to abhor a voluptuous temper; but, with whatever reluctance, I acknowledge this tem∣per to be mine. You imagine your servant Judith to be innocent as well as beautiful; but you took her from a family where hypocrisy, as well as licen∣tiousness, was wrought into a system. My atten∣tion was captivated by her charms, and her princi∣ples were easily seen to be flexible.</P>
<P>"Deem me not capable of the iniquity of seduc∣tion. Your servant is not destitute of feminine and virtuous qualities; but she was taught that the best use of her charms consists in the sale of them. My nocturnal visits to Mettingen were now prompted by a double view, and my correspondence with your servant gave me, at all times, access to your house.</P>
<P>"The second night after our interview, so brief and so little foreseen by either of us, some daemon
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
of mischief seized me. According to my compa∣nion's report, your perfections were little less than divine. Her uncouth but copious narratives con∣verted you into an object of worship. She chiefly dwelt upon your courage, because she herself was deficient in that quality. You held apparitions and goblins in contempt. You took, no precautions against robbers. You were just as tranquil and secure in this lonely dwelling, as if you were in the midst of a crowd.</P>
<P>"Hence a vague project occurred to me, to put this courage to the test. A woman capable of recollection in danger, of warding off groundless panics, of discerning the true mode of proceeding, and profiting by her best resources, is a prodigy. I was desirous of ascertaining whether you were such an one.</P>
<P>"My expedient was obvious and simple: I was to counterfeit a murderous dialogue; but this was to be so conducted that another, and not yourself, should appear to be the object. I was not aware of the possibility that you should appropriate these menaces to yourself. Had you been still and lis∣tened, you would have heard the struggles and prayers of the victim, who would likewise have appeared to be shut up in the closet, and whose voice would have been Judith's. This scene would have been an appeal to your compassion; and the proof of cowardice or courage which I expected from you, would have been your remaining inac∣tive in your bed, or your entering the closet with a view to assist the sufferer. Some instances which Judith related of your fearlesness and promptitude made me adopt the latter supposition with some de∣gree of confidence.</P>
<P>"By the girl's direction I found a ladder, and
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
mounted to your closet window. This is scarcely large enough to admit the head, but it answered my purpose too well.</P>
<P>"I cannot express my confusion and surprize at your abrupt and precipitate flight. I hastily re∣moved the ladder; and, after some pause, curiosity and doubts of your safety induced me to follow you. I found you stretched on the turf before your bro∣ther's door, without sense or motion. I felt the deepest regret at this unlooked for consequence of my scheme. I knew not what to do to procure you relief. The idea of awakening the family na∣turally presented itself. This emergency was cri∣tical, and there was no time to deliberate. It was a sudden thought that occurred. I put my lips to the key-hole, and sounded an alarm which effec∣tually roused the sleepers. My organs were natu∣rally forcible, and had been improved by long and assiduous exercise.</P>
<P>"Long and bitterly did I repent of my scheme. I was somewhat consoled by reflecting that my pur∣pose had not been evil, and renewed my fruitless vows never to attempt such dangerous experiments. For some time I adhered, with laudable forbear∣ance, to this resolution.</P>
<P>"My life has been a life of hardship and expo∣sure. In the summer I prefer to make my bed of the smooth turf, or, at most, the shelter of a sum∣mer-house suffices. In all my rambles I never found a spot in which so many picturesque beauties and rural delights were assembled as at Mettingen. No corner of your little domain unites fragrance and secrecy in so perfect a degree as the recess in the bank. The odour of its leaves, the coolness of its shade, and the music of its water-fall, had attracted my attention. Here my sadness was
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
converted into peaceful melancholy—here my slumbers were sound, and my pleasures enhanced.</P>
<P>"As most free from interruption, I chose this as the scene of my midnight interviews with Judith. One evening, as the sun declined, I was seated here, when I was alarmed by your approach. It was with difficulty that I effected my escape unno∣ticed by you.</P>
<P>"At the customary hour, I returned to your habitation, and was made acquainted by Judith, with your unusual absence. I half suspected the true cause, and felt uneasiness at the danger there was that I should be deprived of my retreat; or, at least, interrupted in the possession of it. The girl, likewise, informed me, that among your other sin∣gularities, it was not uncommon for you to leave your bed, and walk forth for the sake of night-airs and starlight contemplations.</P>
<P>"I desired to prevent this inconvenience. I found you easily swayed by fear. I was influenced, in my choice of means, by the facility and certainty of that to which I had been accustomed. All that I forsaw was, that, in future, this spot would be cautiously shunned by you.</P>
<P>"I entered the recess with the utmost caution, and discovered, by your breathings, in what con∣dition you were. The unexpected interpretation which you placed upon my former proceeding, sug∣gested my conduct on the present occasion. The mode in which heaven is said by the poet, to inter∣fere for the prevention of crimes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>— Peeps through the blanket of the dark, and cries</L><L>Hold! Hold!—</L><BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> was somewhat analogous to my province, and never failed to occur to me at seasons like this. It was requisite to break
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
your slumbers, and for this end I uttered the power∣ful monosyllable, "hold! hold!" My purpose was not prescribed by duty, yet surely it was far from being atrocious and inexpiable. To effect it, I uttered what was false, but it was well suited to my purpose. Nothing less was intended than to injure you. Nay, the evil resulting from my former act, was partly removed by assuring you that in all places but this you were safe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>"MY morals will appear to you far from rigid, yet my conduct will fall short of your suspicions. I am now to confess actions less excusable, and yet surely they will not entitle me to the name of a desperate or sordid criminal.</P>
<P>"Your house was rendered, by your frequent and long absences, easily accessible to my curiosity. My meeting with Pleyel was the prelude to direct intercourse with you. I had seen much of the world, but your character exhibited a specimen of human powers that was wholly new to me. My intercourse with your servant furnished me with curious details of your domestic management. I was of a different sex: I was not your husband; I was not even your friend; yet my knowledge of you was of that kind, which conjugal intimacies can give, and, in some respects, more accurate. The observation of your domestic was guided by me.</P>
<P>"You will not be surprized that I should some∣times profit by your absence, and adventure to exa∣mine with my own eyes, the interior of your cham∣ber. Upright and sincere, you used no watchfulness, and practised no precautions. I scrutinized every thing, and pried every where. Your closet was usually locked, but it was once my fortune to find the key on a bureau. I opened and found new scope for my curiosity in your books. One of these was manuscript, and written in characters which essen∣tially
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
agreed with a short-hand system which I had learned from a Jesuit missionary.</P>
<P>"I cannot justify my conduct, yet my only crime was curiosity. I perused this volume with eagerness. The intellect which it unveiled, was brighter than my limited and feeble organs could bear. I was naturally inquisitive as to your ideas respecting my deportment, and the mysteries that had lately occurred.</P>
<P>"You know what you have written. You know that in this volume the key to your inmost soul was contained. If I had been a profound and malignant impostor, what plenteous materials were thus furnished me of stratagems and plots!</P>
<P>"The coincidence of your dream in the sum∣mer-house with my exclamation, was truly won∣derful. The voice which warned you to forbear was, doubtless, mine; but mixed by a common process of the fancy, with the train of visionary incidents.</P>
<P>"I saw in a stronger light than ever, the dan∣gerousness of that instrument which I employed, and renewed my resolutions to abstain from the use of it in future; but I was destined perpetually to violate my resolutions. By some perverse fate, I was led into circumstances in which the exertion of my powers was the sole or the best means of escape.</P>
<P>"On that memorable night on which our last interview took place, I came as usual to Mettin∣gen. I was apprized of your engagement at your brother's, from which you did not expect to return till late. Some incident suggested the design of visit∣ing your chamber. Among your books which I had not examined, might be something tending to illustrate your character, or the history of your fa∣mily.
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
Some intimation had been dropped by you in discourse, respecting a performance of your father in which some important transaction in his life wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> recorded.</P>
<P>"I was desirous of seeing this book; and such was my habitual attachment to mystery, that I pre¦ferred the clandestine perusal of it. Such were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> motives that induced me to make this attempt. Ju¦dith had disappeared, and finding the house unoc¦cupied, I supplied myself with a light, and proceede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to your chamber.</P>
<P>"I found it easy, on experiment, to lock an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unlock your closet door without the aid of a key▪ I shut myself in this recess, and was busily ex¦ploring your shelves, when I heard some one ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the room below. I was at a loss who it could be, whether you or your servant. Doubtful, how¦ever, as I was, I conceived it prudent to extinguish the light. Scarcely was this done, when some on entered the chamber. The footsteps were easil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distinguished to be yours.</P>
<P>"My situation was now full of danger and per¦plexity. For some time, I cherished the hope tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you would leave the room so long as to afford m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an opportunity of escaping. As the hours passed this hope gradually deserted me. It was plain tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you had retired for the night.</P>
<P>"I knew not how soon you might find occasion to enter the closet. I was alive to all the horror of detection, and ruminated without ceasing, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the behaviour which it would be proper, in case o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> detection, to adopt. I was unable to discover an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consistent method of accounting for my being thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immured.</P>
<P>"It occurred to me that I might withdraw you from your chamber for a few minutes, by counter¦feiting
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
a voice from without. Some message from your brother might be delivered, requiring your pre∣sence at his house. I was deterred from this scheme by reflecting on the resolution I had formed, and on the possible evils that might result from it. Besides, it was not improbable that you would speedily retire to bed, and then, by the exercise of sufficient cau∣tion, I might hope to escape unobserved.</P>
<P>"Meanwhile I listened with the deepest anxiety to every motion from without. I discovered no∣thing which betokened preparation for sleep. In∣stead of this I heard deep-drawn sighs, and occasion∣ally an half-expressed and mournful ejaculation. Hence I inferred that you were unhappy. The true state of your mind with regard to Pleyel your own pen had disclosed; but I supposed you to be framed of such materials, that, though a momentary sadness might affect you, you were impregnable to any per∣manent and heartfelt grief. Inquietude for my own safety was, for a moment, suspended by sympathy with your distress.</P>
<P>"To the former consideration I was quickly recalled by a motion of yours which indicated I knew not what. I fostered the persuasion that you would now retire to bed; but presently you ap∣proached the closet, and detection seemed to be in∣evitable. You put your hand upon the lock. I had formed no plan to extricate myself from the dilemma in which the opening of the door would involve me. I felt an irreconcilable aversion to de∣tection. Thus situated, I involuntarily seized the door with a resolution to resist your efforts to open it.</P>
<P>"Suddenly you receded from the door. This de∣portment was inexplicable, but the relief it afforded me was quickly gone. You returned, and I once
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
more was thrown into perplexity. The expedient that suggested itself was precipitate and inartificial. I exerted my organs and called upon you <HI>to hold.</HI></P>
<P>"That you should persist in spite of this admo∣nition, was a subject of astonishment. I again re∣sisted your efforts; for the first expedient having failed, I knew not what other to resort to. In this state, how was my astonishment increased when I heard your exclamations!</P>
<P>"It was now plain that you knew me to be within. Further resistance was unavailing and use∣less. The door opened, and I shrunk backward. Seldom have I felt deeper mortification, and more painful perplexity. I did not consider that the truth would be less injurious than any lie which I could hastily frame. Conscious as I was of a certain de∣gree of guilt, I conceived that you would form the most odious suspicions. The truth would be im∣perfect, unless I were likewise to explain the mys∣terious admonition which had been given; but that explanation was of too great moment, and involved too extensive consequences to make me suddenly resolve to give it.</P>
<P>"I was aware that this discovery would associate itself in your mind, with the dialogue formerly heard in this closet. Thence would your suspicions be aggravated, and to escape from these suspicions would be impossible. But the mere truth would be sufficiently opprobrious, and deprive me for ever of your good opinion.</P>
<P>"Thus was I rendered desperate, and my mind rapidly passed to the contemplation of the use that might be made of previous events. Some good genius would appear to you to have interposed to save you from injury intended by me. Why, I said, since I must sink in her opinion, should I not cherish
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
this belief? Why not personate an enemy, and pretend that celestial interference has frustrated my schemes? I must fly, but let me leave wonder and fear behind me. Elucidation of the mystery will always be practicable. I shall do no injury, but merely talk of evil that was designed, but is now past.</P>
<P>"Thus I extenuated my conduct to myself, but I scarcely expect that this will be to you a sufficient explication of the scene that followed. Those habits which I have imbibed, the rooted passion which possesses me for scattering around me amazement and fear, you enjoy no opportunities of knowing. That a man should wantonly impute to himself the most flagitious designs, will hardly be credited, even though you reflect that my reputation was already, by my own folly, irretrievably ruined; and that it was always in my power to communicate the truth, and rectify the mistake.</P>
<P>"I left you to ponder on this scene. My mind was full of rapid and incongruous ideas. Com∣punction, self-upbraiding, hopelesness, satisfaction at the view of those effects likely to flow from my new scheme, misgivings as to the beneficial result of this scheme took possession of my mind, and seemed to struggle for the mastery.</P>
<P>"I had gone too far to recede. I had painted myself to you as an assassin and ravisher, withheld from guilt only by a voice from heaven. I had thus reverted into the path of error, and now, hav∣ing gone thus far, my progress seemed to be irre∣vocable. I said to myself, I must leave these pre∣cincts for ever. My acts have blasted my fame in the eyes of the Wielands. For the sake of creating a mysterious dread, I have made myself a villain. I may complete this mysterious plan by some new
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
imposture, but I cannot aggravate my supposed guilt.</P>
<P>"My resolution was formed, and I was swiftly ruminating on the means for executing it, when Pleyel appeared in sight. This incident decided my conduct. It was plain that Pleyel was a devoted lover, but he was, at the same time, a man of cold resolves and exquisite sagacity. To deceive him would be the sweetest triumph I had ever enjoyed. The deception would be momentary, but it would likewise be complete. That his delusion would so soon be rectified, was a recommendation to my scheme, for I esteemed him too much to desire to entail upon him lasting agonies.</P>
<P>"I had no time to reflect further, for he pro∣ceeded, with a quick step, towards the house. I was hurried onward involuntarily and by a mecha∣nical impulse. I followed him as he passed the re∣cess in the bank, and shrowding myself in that spot, I counterfeited sounds which I knew would arrest his steps.</P>
<P>"He stopped, turned, listened, approached, and overheard a dialogue whose purpose was to van∣quish his belief in a point where his belief was most difficult to vanquish. I exerted all my powers to imitate your voice, your general sentiments, and your language. Being master, by means of your journal, of your personal history and most secret thoughts, my efforts were the more successful. When I reviewed the tenor of this dialogue, I can∣not believe but that Pleyel was deluded. When I think of your character, and of the inferences which this dialogue was intended to suggest, it seems incredible that this delusion should be pro∣duced.</P>
<P>"I spared not myself. I called myself murderer,
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
thief, guilty of innumerable perjuries and misdeeds: that you had debased yourself to the level of such an one, no evidence, methought, would suffice to convince him who knew you so thoroughly as Pleyel; and yet the imposture amounted to proof which the most jealous scrutiny would find to be unexceptionable.</P>
<P>"He left his station precipitately and resumed his way to the house. I saw that the detection of his error would be instantaneous, since, not having gone to bed, an immediate interview would take place between you. At first this circumstance was considered with regret; but as time opened my eyes to the possible consequences of this scene, I regard∣ed it with pleasure.</P>
<P>"In a short time the infatuation which had led me thus far began to subside. The remembrance of former reasonings and transactions was renewed. How often I had repented this kind of exertion; how many evils were produced by it which I had not foreseen; what occasions for the bitterest re∣morse it had administered, now passed through my mind. The black catalogue of stratagems was now increased. I had inspired you with the most vehe∣ment terrors: I had filled your mind with faith in shadows and confidence in dreams: I had depraved the imagination of Pleyel: I had exhibited you to his understanding as devoted to brutal gratifications and consummate in hypocrisy. The evidence which accompanied this delusion would be irresistible to one whose passion had perverted his judgment, whose jealousy with regard to me had already been excited, and who, therefore, would not fail to overrate the force of this evidence. What fatal act of despair or of vengeance might not this error produce?</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="260"/>"With regard to myself, I had acted with a phrenzy that surpassed belief. I had warred against my peace and my fame: I had banished myself from the fellowship of vigorous and pure minds: I was self-expelled from a scene which the munificence of nature had adorned with unrivalled beauties, and from haunts in which all the muses and humanities had taken refuge.</P>
<P>"I was thus torn by conflicting fears and tu∣multuous regrets. The night passed away in this state of confusion, and next morning in the gazette left at my obscure lodging, I read a description and an offer of reward for the apprehension of my per∣son. I was said to have escaped from an Irish pri∣son, in which I was confined as an offender con∣victed of enormous and complicated crimes.</P>
<P>"This was the work of an enemy, who, by falsehood and stratagem, had procured my condem∣nation. I was indeed, a prisoner, but escaped, by the exertion of my powers, the fate to which I was doomed, but which I did not deserve. I had hoped that the malice of my foe was exhausted; but I now perceived that my precautions had been wise, for that the intervention of an ocean was insuffici∣ent for my security.</P>
<P>"Let me not dwell on the sensations which this discovery produced. I need not tell by what steps I was induced to seek an interview with you, for the purpose of disclosing the truth, and repairing, as far as possible, the effects of my misconduct. It was unavoidable that this gazette would fall into your hands, and that it would tend to confirm every erroneous impression.</P>
<P>"Having gained this interview, I purposed to seek some retreat in the wilderness, inaccessible to your inquiry and to the malice of my foe, where
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
I might henceforth employ myself in composing a faithtul narrative of my actions. I designed it as my vindication from the aspersions that had rested on my character, and as a lesson to mankind on the evils of credulity on the one hand, and of im∣posture on the other.</P>
<P>"I wrote you a billet, which was left at the house of your friend, and which I knew would, by some means, speedily come to your hands. I en∣tertained a faint hope that my invitation would be complied with. I knew not what use you would make of the opportunity which this proposal afford∣ed you of procuring the seizure of my person; but this fate I was determined to avoid, and I had no doubt but due circumspection, and the exercise of the faculty which I possessed, would enable me to avoid it.</P>
<P>"I lurked, through the day, in the neighbour∣hood of Mettingen: I approached your habitation at the appointed hour: I entered it in silence, by a trap-door which led into the cellar. This had for∣merly been bolted on the inside, but Judith had, at an early period in our intercourse, removed this impediment. I ascended to the first floor, but met with no one, nor any thing that indicated the pre∣sence of an human being.</P>
<P>"I crept softly up stairs, and at length perceived your chamber door to be opened, and a light to be within. It was of moment to discover by whom this light was accompanied. I was sensible of the inconveniencies to which my being discovered at your chamber door by any one within would sub∣ject me; I therefore called out in my own voice, but so modified that it should appear to ascend from the court below, 'Who is in the chamber? Is it Miss Wieland?'</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="262"/>"No answer was returned to this summons. I listened, but no motion could be heard. After a pause I repeated my call, but no less ineffectually.</P>
<P>"I now approached nearer the door, and adven∣tured to look in. A light stood on the table, but nothing human was discernible. I entered cauti∣ously, but all was solitude and stillness.</P>
<P>"I knew not what to conclude. If the house were inhabited, my call would have been noticed; yet some suspicion insinuated itself that silence was studiously kept by persons who intended to surprize me. My approach had been wary, and the silence that ensued my call had likewise preceded it; a cir∣cumstance that tended to dissipate my fears.</P>
<P>"At length it occurred to me that Judith might possibly be in her own room. I turned my steps thither; but she was not to be found. I passed into other rooms, and was soon convinced that the house was totally deserted. I returned to your chamber, agitated by vain surmises and opposite conjectures. The appointed hour had passed, and I dismissed the hope of an interview.</P>
<P>"In this state of things I determined to leave a few lines on your toilet, and prosecute my journey to the mountains. Scarcely had I taken the pen when I laid it aside, uncertain in what manner to address you. I rose from the table and walked across the floor. A glance thrown upon the bed acquaint∣ed me with a spectacle to which my conceptions of horror had not yet reached.</P>
<P>"In the midst of shuddering and trepidation, the signal of your presence in the court below recalled me to myself. The deed was newly done: I only was in the house: what had lately happened justi∣fied any suspicions, however enormous. It was plain that this catastrophe was unknown to you: I
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
thought upon the wild commotion which the disco∣very would awaken in your breast: I found the confusion of my own thoughts unconquerable, and perceived that the end for which I sought an inter∣view was not now to be accomplished.</P>
<P>"In this state of things it was likewise expedient to conceal my being within. I put out the light and hurried down stairs. To my unspeakable sur∣prize, notwithstanding every motive to fear, you lighted a candle and proceeded to your chamber.</P>
<P>"I retired to that room below from which a door leads into the cellar. This door concealed me from your view as you passed. I thought upon the spec∣tacle which was about to present itself. In an ex∣igence so abrupt and so little foreseen, I was again subjected to the empire of mechanical and habitual impulses. I dreaded the effects which this shock∣ing exhibition, bursting on your unprepared senses, might produce.</P>
<P>"Thus actuated, I stept swiftly to the door, and thrusting my head forward, once more pronounced the mysterious interdiction. At that moment, by some untoward fate, your eyes were cast back, and you saw me in the very act of utterance. I fled through the darksome avenue at which I entered, covered with the shame of this detection.</P>
<P>"With diligence, stimulated by a thousand in∣effable emotions, I pursued my intended journey. I have a brother whose farm is situated in the bo∣som of a fertile desert, near the sources of the Le∣heigh, and thither I now repaired.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="24" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>"DEEPLY did I ruminate on the occurrences that had, just passed. Nothing excited my wonder so much as the means by which you discovered my being in the closet. This discovery appeared to be made at the moment when you attempted to open it. How could you have otherwise remained so long in the chamber apparently fearless and tran∣quil? And yet, having made this discovery, how could you persist in dragging me forth: persist in defiance of an interdiction so emphatical and so∣lemn?</P>
<P>"But your sister's death was an event detestable and ominous. She had been the victim of the most dreadful species of assassination. How, in a state like yours, the murderous intention could be gene∣rated, was wholly inconceivable.</P>
<P>"I did not relinquish my design of confessing to you the part which I had sustained in your family, but I was willing to defer it till the task which I had set myself was finished. That being done, I resumed the resolution. The motives to incite me to this continually acquired force. The more I re∣volved the events happening at Mettingen, the more insupportable and ominous my terrors became. My waking hours and my sleep were vexed by dismal presages and frightful intimations.</P>
<P>"Catharine was dead by violence. Surely my malignant stars had not made me the cause of her death; yet had I not rashly set in motion a machine,
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
over whose progress I had no controul, and which experience had shewn me was infinite in power? Every day might add to the catalogue of horrors of which this was the source, and a seasonable disclo∣sure of the truth might prevent numberless ills.</P>
<P>"Fraught with this conception, I have turned my steps hither. I find your brother's house deso∣late: the furniture removed, and the walls stained with damps. Your own is in the same situation. Your chamber is dismantled and dark, and you exhibit an image of incurable grief, and of rapid decay.</P>
<P>"I have uttered the truth. This is the extent of my offences. You tell me an horrid tale of Wieland being led to the destruction of his wife and children, by some mysterious agent. You charge me with the guilt of this agency; but I repeat that the amount of my guilt has been truly stated. The perpetrator of Catharine's death was unknown to me till now; nay, it is still unknown to me."</P>
<P>At that moment, the closing of a door in the kitchen was distinctly heard by us. Carwin started and paused. "There is some one coming. I must not be found here by my enemies, and need not, since my purpose is answered."</P>
<P>I had drunk in, with the most vehement attention, every word that he had uttered. I had no breath to interrupt his tale by interrogations or comments. The power that he spoke of was hitherto unknown to me: its existence was incredible; it was suscep∣tible of no direct proof.</P>
<P>He owns that his were the voice and face which I heard and saw. He attempts to give an human explanation of these phantasms; but it is enough that he owns himself to be the agent; his tale is a lie, and his nature devilish. As he deceived me,
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
he likewise deceived my brother, and now do I be∣hold the author of all our calamities!</P>
<P>Such were my thoughts when his pause allowed me to think. I should have bad him begone if the silence had not been interrupted; but now I feared no more for myself; and the milkiness of my nature was curdled into hatred and rancour. Some one was near, and this enemy of God and man might possibly be brought to justice. I reflected not that the preternatural power which he had hitherto ex∣erted, would avail to rescue him from any toils in which his feet might be entangled. Meanwhile, looks, and not words of menace and abhorrence, were all that I could bestow.</P>
<P>He did not depart. He seemed dubious, whether, by passing out of the house, or by remaining some∣what longer where he was, he should most endan∣ger his safety. His confusion increased when steps of one barefoot were heard upon the stairs. He threw anxious glances sometimes at the closet, some∣times at the window, and sometimes at the chamber door, yet he was detained by some inexplicable fas∣cination. He stood as if rooted to the spot.</P>
<P>As to me, my soul was bursting with detestation and revenge. I had no room for surmises and fears respecting him that approached. It was doubtless a human being, and would befriend me so far as to aid me in arresting this offender.</P>
<P>The stranger quickly entered the room. My eyes and the eyes of Carwin were, at the same mo∣ment, darted upon him. A second glance was not needed to inform us who he was. His locks were tangled, and fell confusedly over his forehead and ears. His shirt was of coarse stuff, and open at the neck and breast. His coat was once of bright and fine texture, but now torn and tarnished
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
with dust. His feet, his legs, and his arms were bare. His features were the seat of a wild and tranquil solemnity, but his eyes bespoke inquietude and curiosity.</P>
<P>He advanced with firm step, and looking as in search of some one. He saw me and stopped. He bent his sight on the floor, and clenching his hands, appeared suddenly absorbed in meditation. Such were the figure and deportment of Wieland! Such, in his fallen state, were the aspect and guise of my brother!</P>
<P>Carwin did not fail to recognize the visitant. Care for his own safety was apparently swallowed up in the amazement which this spectacle produc∣ed. His station was conspicuous, and he could not have escaped the roving glances of Wieland; yet the latter seemed totally unconscious of his pre∣sence.</P>
<P>Grief at this scene of ruin and blast was at first the only sentiment of which I was conscious. A fearful stillness ensued. At length Wieland, lifting his hands, which were locked in each other, to his breast, exclaimed, "Father! I thank thee. This is thy guidance. Hither thou hast led me, that I might perform thy will: yet let me not err: let me hear again thy messenger!"</P>
<P>He stood for a minute as if listening; but reco∣vering from his attitude, he continued—"It is not needed. Dastardly wretch! thus eternally ques∣tioning the behests of thy Maker! weak in resolu∣tion! wayward in faith!"</P>
<P>He advanced to me, and, after another pause, re∣sumed: "Poor girl! a dismal fate has set its mark upon thee. Thy life is demanded as a sacrifice. Prepare thee to die. Make not my office difficult by fruitless opposition. Thy prayers might subdue
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
stones; but none but he who enjoined my purpose can shake it."</P>
<P>These words were a sufficient explication of the scene. The nature of his phrenzy, as described by my uncle, was remembered. I who had sought death, was now thrilled with horror because it was near. Death in this form, death from the hand of a brother, was thought upon with undescribable repugnance.</P>
<P>In a state thus verging upon madness, my eye glanced upon Carwin. His astonishment appeared to have struck him motionless and dumb. My life was in danger, and my brother's hand was about to be embrued in my blood. I firmly believed that Carwin's was the instigation. I could rescue me from this abhorred fate; I could dissipate this tre∣mendous illusion; I could save my brother from the perpetration of new horrors, by pointing out the devil who seduced him; to hesitate a moment was to perish. These thoughts gave strength to my limbs, and energy to my accents: I started on my feet.</P>
<P>"O brother! spare me, spare thyself: There is thy betrayer. He counterfeited the voice and face of an angel, for the purpose of destroying thee and me. He has this moment confessed it. He is able to speak where he is not. He is leagued with hell, but will not avow it; yet he confesses that the agency was his."</P>
<P>My brother turned slowly his eyes, and fixed them upon Carwin. Every joint in the frame of the latter trembled. His complexion was paler than a ghost's. His eye dared not meet that of Wieland, but wandered with an air of distraction from one space to another.</P>
<P>"Man," said my brother, in a voice totally un∣like that which he had used to me, "what art
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
thou? The charge has been made. Answer it. The visage—the voice—at the bottom of these stairs—at the hour of eleven—To whom did they belong? To thee?"</P>
<P>Twice did Carwin attempt to speak, but his words died away upon his lips. My brother re∣sumed in a tone of greater vehemence—</P>
<P>"Thou falterest; faltering is ominous; say yes or no: one word will suffice; but beware of false∣hood. Was it a stratagem of hell to overthrow my family? Wast thou the agent?"</P>
<P>I now saw that the wrath which had been pre∣pared for me was to be heaped upon another. The tale that I heard from him, and his present trepida∣tions, were abundant testimonies of his guilt. But what if Wieland should be undeceived! What if he shall find his acts to have proceeded not from an heavenly prompter, but from human treachery! Will not his rage mount into whirlwind? Will not he tare limb from limb this devoted wretch?</P>
<P>Instinctively I recoiled from this image, but it gave place to another. Carwin may be innocent, but the impetuosity of his judge may misconstrue his answers into a confession of guilt. Wieland knows not that mysterious voices and appearances were likewise witnessed by me. Carwin may be ignorant of those which misled my brother. Thus may his answers unwarily betray himself to ruin.</P>
<P>Such might be the consequences of my frantic precipitation, and these, it was necessary, if possible, to prevent. I attempted to speak, but Wieland, turning suddenly upon me, commanded silence, in a tone furious and terrible. My lips closed, and my tongue refused its office.</P>
<P>"What art thou?" he resumed, addressing himself to Carwin. "Answer me; whose form—
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
whose voice—was it thy contrivance? Answer me."</P>
<P>The answer was now given, but confusedly and scarcely articulated. "I meant nothing—I intended no ill—if I understand—if I do not mistake you—it is too true—I did appear—in the entry—did speak. The contrivance was mine, but—"</P>
<P>These words were no sooner uttered, than my brother ceased to wear the same aspect. His eyes were downcast: he was motionless: his respiration became hoarse, like that of a man in the agonies of death. Carwin seemed unable to say more. He might have easily escaped, but the thought which occupied him related to what was horrid and unin∣telligible in this scene, and not to his own danger.</P>
<P>Presently the faculties of Wieland, which, for a time, were chained up, were seized with restlessness and trembling. He broke silence. The stoutest heart would have been appalled by the tone in which he spoke. He addressed himself to Carwin.</P>
<P>"Why art thou here? Who detains thee? Go and learn better. I will meet thee, but it must be at the bar of thy Maker. There shall I bear wit∣ness against thee."</P>
<P>Perceiving that Carwin did not obey, he con∣tinued; "Dost thou wish me to complete the cata∣logue by thy death? Thy life is a worthless thing. Tempt me no more. I am but a man, and thy presence may awaken a fury which may spum my controul. Begone!"</P>
<P>Carwin, irresolute, striving in vain for utterance, his complexion pallid as death, his knees beating one against another, slowly obeyed the mandate and withdrew.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXV.</HEAD>
<P>A Few words more and I lay aside the pen for ever. Yet why should I not relinquish it now? All that I have said is preparatory to this scene, and my fingers, tremulous and cold as my heart, refuse any further exertion. This must not be. Let my last energies support me in the finishing of this task. Then will I lay down my head in the lap of death. Hushed will be all my murmurs in the sleep of the grave.</P>
<P>Every sentiment has perished in my bosom. Even friendship is extinct. Your love for me has prompted me to this task; but I would not have complied if it had not been a luxury thus to feast upon my woes. I have justly calculated upon my remnant of strength. When I lay down the pen the taper of life will expire: my existence will ter∣minate with my tale.</P>
<P>Now that I was left alone with Wieland, the perils of my situation presented themselves to my mind. That this paroxysm should terminate in havock and rage it was reasonable to predict. The first suggestion of my fears had been disproved by my experience. Carwin had acknowledged his of∣fences, and yet had escaped. The venge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce which I had harboured had not been admitted by Wieland, and yet the evils which I had endured, compared with those inflicted on my brother, were as nothing. I thirsted for his blood, and was tormented with an insatiable appetite for his destruction; yet my bro∣ther
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
was unmoved, and had dismissed him in safety. Surely thou wast more than man, while I am sunk below the beasts.</P>
<P>Did I place a right construction on the conduct of Wieland? Was the error that misled him so easily rectified? Were views so vivid and faith so strenuous thus liable to fading and to change? Was there not reason to doubt the accuracy of my per∣ceptions? With images like these was my mind thronged, till the deportment of my brother called away my attention.</P>
<P>I saw his lips move and his eyes cast up to hea∣ven. Then would he listen and look back, as if in expectation of some one's appearance. Thrice he repeated these gesticulations and this inaudible prayer. Each time the mist of confusion and doubt seemed to grow darker and to settle on his under∣standing. I guessed at the meaning of these tokens. The words of Carwin had shaken his belief, and he was employed in summoning the messenger who had formerly communed with him, to attest the value of those new doubts. In vain the summons was repeated, for his eye met nothing but vacancy, and not a sound saluted his ear.</P>
<P>He walked to the bed, gazed with eagerness at the pillow which had sustained the head of the breathless Catharine, and then returned to the place where I sat. I had no power to lift my eyes to his face: I was dubious of his purpose: this purpose might aim at my life.</P>
<P>Alas! nothing but subjection to danger, and ex∣posure to temptation, can show us what we are. By this test was I now tried, and found to be cow∣ardly and rash. Men can deliberately untie the thread of life, and of this I had deemed myself ca∣pable; yet now that I stood upon the brink of fate,
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
that the knife of the sacrificer was aimed at my heart, I shuddered and betook myself to any means of escape, however monstrous.</P>
<P>Can I bear to think—can I endure to relate the outrage which my heart meditated? Where were my means of safety? Resistance was vain. Not even the energy of despair could set me on a level with that strength which his terrifie prompter had bestowed upon Wieland. Terror enables us to perform incredible feats; but terror was not then the state of my mind: where then were my hopes of rescue?</P>
<P>Methinks it is too much. I stand aside, as it were, from myself; I estimate my own deservings; a hatred, immortal and inexorable, is my due. I listen to my own pleas, and find them empty and false: yes, I acknowledge that my guilt surpasses that of all mankind: I confess that the curses of a world, and the frowns of a deity, are inadequate to my demerits. Is there a thing in the world wor∣thy of infinite abhorrence? It is I.</P>
<P>What shall I say! I was menaced, as I thought, with death, and, to elude this evil, my hand was ready to inflict death upon the menacer. In visit∣ing my house, I had made provision against the machinations of Carwin. In a fold of my dress an open penknife was concealed. This I now seized and drew forth. It lurked out of view; but I now see that my state of mind would have rendered the deed inevitable if my brother had lifted his hand. This instrument of my preservation would have been plunged into his heart.</P>
<P>O, insupportable remembrance! hide thee from my view for a time; hide it from me that my heart was black enough to meditate the stabbing of a
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
brother! a brother thus supreme in misery; thus towering in virtue!</P>
<P>He was probably unconscious of my design, but presently drew back. This interval was sufficient to restore me to myself. The madness, the iniquity of that act which I had purposed rushed upon my apprehension. For a moment I was breathless with agony. At the next moment I recovered my strength, and threw the knife with violence on the floor.</P>
<P>The sound awoke my brother from his reverie. He gazed alternately at me and at the weapon, With a movement equally solemn he stooped and took it up. He placed the blade in different posi∣tions, scrutinizing it accurately, and maintaining, at the same time, a profound silence.</P>
<P>Again he looked at me, but all that vehemence and loftiness of spirit which had so lately charac∣terized his features, were flown. Fallen muscles, a forehead contracted into folds, eyes dim with un∣bidden drops, and a ruefulness of aspect which no words can describe, were now visible.</P>
<P>His looks touched into energy the same sympa∣thies in me, and I poured forth a flood of tears. This passion was quickly checked by fear, which had now, no longer, my own, but his safety for their object. I watched his deportment in silence. At length he spoke:</P>
<P>"Sister," said he, in an accent mournful and mild, "I have acted poorly my part in this world. What thinkest thou? Shall I not do better in the next?"</P>
<P>I could make no answer. The mildness of his tone astonished and encouraged me. I continued to regard him with wistful and anxious looks.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="275"/>"I think," resumed he, "I will try. My wife and my babes have gone before. Happy wretches! I have sent you to repose, and ought not to linger behind."</P>
<P>These words had a meaning sufficiently intelli∣gible. I looked at the open knife in his hand and shuddered, but knew not how to prevent the deed which I dreaded. He quickly noticed my fears, and comprehended them. Stretching towards me his hand, with an air of increasing mildness: "Take it," said he: "Fear not for thy own sake, nor for mine. The cup is gone by, and its transient inebriation is succeeded by the soberness of truth.</P>
<P>"Thou angel whom I was wont to worship! fearest thou, my sister, for thy life? Once it was the scope of my labours to destroy thee, but I was prompted to the deed by heaven; such, at least, was my belief. Thinkest thou that thy death was sought to gratify malevolence? No. I am pure from all stain. I believed that my God was my mover!</P>
<P>"Neither thee nor myself have I cause to injure. I have done my duty, and surely there is merit in having sacrificed to that, all that is dear to the heart of man. If a devil has deceived me, he came in the habit of an angel. If I erred, it was not my judgment that deceived me, but my senses. In thy sight, being of beings! I am still pure. Still will I look for my reward in thy justice!"</P>
<P>Did my ears truly report these sounds? If I did not err, my brother was restored to just perceptions. He knew himself to have been betrayed to the mur∣der of his wife and children, to have been the victim of internal artifice; yet he found consolation in the rectitude of his motives. He was not devoid of sorrow, for this was written on his countenance; but his soul was tranquil and sublime.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="276"/>Perhaps this was merely a transition of his former madness into a new shape. Perhaps he had not yet awakened to the memory of the horrors which he had perpetrated. Infatuated wretch that I was! To set myself up as a model by which to judge of my heroic brother! My reason taught me that his conclusions were right; but conscious of the impo∣tence of reason over my own conduct; conscious of my cowardly rashness and my criminal despair, I doubted whether any one could be stedfast and wise.</P>
<P>Such was my weakness, that even in the midst of these thoughts, my mind glided into abhorrence of Carwin, and I uttered in a low voice, O! Car∣win! Carwin! What hast thou to answer for?</P>
<P>My brother immediately noticed the involuntary exclamation: "Clara!" said he, "be thyself. Equity used to be a theme for thy eloquence. Re∣duce its lessons to practice, and be just to that un∣fortunate man. The instrument has done its work, and I am satisfied.</P>
<P>"I thank thee, my God, for this last illumina∣tion! My enemy is thine also. I deemed him to be man, the man with whom I have often com∣muned; but now thy goodness has unveiled to me his true nature. As the performer of thy behests, he is my friend."</P>
<P>My heart began now to misgive me. His mourn∣ful aspect had gradually yielded place to a serene brow. A new soul appeared to actuate his frame, and his eyes to beam with preternatural lustre. These symptoms did not abate, and he continued:</P>
<P>"Clara! I must not leave thee in doubt. I know not what brought about thy interview with the being whom thou callest Carwin. For a time, I was guilty of thy error, and deduced from his in∣coherent confessions that I had been made the victim
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
of human malice. He left us at my bidding, and I put up a prayer that my doubts should be removed. Thy eyes were shut, and thy ears sealed to the vision that answered my prayer.</P>
<P>"I was indeed deceived. The form thou hast seen was the incarnation of a daemon. The visage and voice which urged me to the sacrifice of my family, were his. Now he personates a human form: then he was invironed with the lustre of heaven.—</P>
<P>"Clara," he continued, advancing closer to me, "thy death must come. This minister is evil, but he from whom his commission was received is God. Submit then with all thy wonted resignation to a decree that cannot be reversed or resisted. Mark the clock. Three minutes are allowed to thee, in which to call up thy fortitude, and prepare thee for thy doom." There he stopped.</P>
<P>Even now, when this scene exists only in me∣mory, when life and all its functions have sunk into torpor, my pulse throbs, and my hairs uprise: my brows are knit, as then; and I gaze around me in distraction. I was unconquerably averse to death; but death, imminent and full of agony as that which was threatened, was nothing. This was not the only or chief inspirer of my fears.</P>
<P>For him, not for myself, was my soul tormented. I might die, and no crime, surpassing the reach of mercy, would pursue me to the presence of my Judge; but my assassin would survive to contem∣plate his deed, and that assassin was Wieland!</P>
<P>Wings to bear me beyond his reach I had not. I could not vanish with a thought. The door was open, but my murderer was interposed between that and me. Of self-defence I was incapable. The
<PB N="276" REF="278"/>
phrenzy that lately prompted me to blood was gone; my state was desperate; my rescue was impossible.</P>
<P>The weight of these accumulated thoughts could not be borne. My sight became confused; my limbs were seized with convulsion; I spoke, but my words were half-formed:—</P>
<P>"Spare me, my brother! Look down, righte∣ous, Judge! snatch me from this fate! take away this fury from him, or turn it elsewhere!"</P>
<P>Such was the agony of my thoughts, that I no∣ticed not steps entering my apartment. Supplicating eyes were cast upward, but when my prayer was breathed, I once more wildly gazed at the door. A form met my sight: I shuddered as if the God whom I invoked were present. It was Carwin that again intruded, and who stood before me, erect in atti∣tude, and stedfast in look!</P>
<P>The sight of him awakened new and rapid thoughts. His recent tale was remembered: his magical transitions and mysterious energy of voice: Whether he were infernal or miraculous, or hu∣man, there was no power and no need to decide. Whether the contriver or not of this spell, he was able to unbind it, and to check the fury of my bro∣ther. He had ascribed to himself intentions not ma∣lignant. Here now was afforded a test of his truth. Let him interpose, as from above; revoke the savage decree which the madness of Wieland has assigned to heaven, and extinguish for ever this passion for blood!</P>
<P>My mind detected at a glance this avenue to safety. The recommendations it possessed throng∣ed as it were together, and made but one impres∣sion on my intellect. Remoter effects and colla∣teral dangers I saw not. Perhaps the pause of an
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
instant had sufficed to call them up. The impro∣bability that the influence which governed Wieland was external or human; the tendency of this stra∣tagem to sanction so fatal an error, or substitute a more destructive rage in place of this; the suf∣ficiency of Carwin's mere muscular forces to coun∣teract the efforts, and restrain the fury of Wieland, might, at a second glance, have been discovered; but no second glance was allowed. My first thought hurried me to action, and, fixing my eyes upon Car∣win I exclaimed—</P>
<P>"O wretch! once more hast thou come? Let it be to abjure thy malice; to counterwork this hellish stratagem; to turn from me and from my brother, this desolating rage!</P>
<P>"Testify thy innocence or thy remorse: exert the powers which pertain to thee, whatever they be, to turn aside this ruin. Thou art the author of these horrors! What have I done to deserve thus to die? How have I merited this unrelenting per∣secution? I adjure thee, by that God whose voice thou hast dared to counterfeit, to save my life!</P>
<P>"Wilt thou then go? leave me! Succourless!"</P>
<P>Carwin listened to my intreaties unmoved, and turned from me. He seemed to hesitate a moment: then glided through the door. Rage and despair stifled my utterance. The interval of respite was passed; the pangs reserved for me by Wieland, were not to be endured; my thoughts rushed again into anarchy. Having received the knife from his hand, I held it loosely and without regard; but now it seized again my attention, and I grasped it with force.</P>
<P>He seemed to notice not the entrance or exit of Carwin. My gesture and the murderous weapon appeared to have escaped his notice. His silence
<PB N="278" REF="280"/>
was unbroken; his eye, fixed upon the clock for a time, was now withdrawn; fury kindled in every feature; all that was human in his face gave way to an expression supernatural and tremendous. I felt my left arm within his grasp.—</P>
<P>Even now I hesitated to strike. I shrunk from his assault, but in vain.—</P>
<P>Here let me desist. Why should I rescue this event from oblivion? Why should I paint this de∣testable conflict? Why not terminate at once this series of horrors?—Hurry to the verge of the pre∣cipice, and cast myself for ever beyond remem∣brance and beyond hope?</P>
<P>Still I live: with this load upon my breast; with this phantom to pursue my steps; with adders lodged in my bosom, and stinging me to madness: still I consent to live!</P>
<P>Yes, I will rise above the sphere of mortal pas∣sions: I will spurn at the cowardly remorse that bids me seek impunity in silence, or comfort in for∣getfulness. My nerves shall be new strung to the task. Have I not resolved? I will die. The gulph before me is inevitable and near. I will die, but then only when my tale is at an end.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>MY right hand, grasping the unseen knife, was still disengaged. It was lifted to strike. All my strength was exhausted, but what was sufficient to the performance of this deed. Already was the energy awakened, and the impulse given, that should bear the fatal steel to his heart, when— Wieland shrunk back: his hand was withdrawn. Breathless with affright and desperation, I stood, freed from his grasp; unassailed; untouched.</P>
<P>Thus long had the power which controuled the scene forborne to interfere; but now his might was irresistible, and Wieland in a moment was disarm∣ed of all his purposes. A voice, louder than hu∣man organs could produce, shriller than language can depict, burst from the ceiling, and commanded him—<HI>to hold!</HI></P>
<P>Trouble and dismay succeeded to the stedfastness that had lately been displayed in the looks of Wie∣land. His eyes roved from one quarter to another, with an expression of doubt. He seemed to wait for a further intimation.</P>
<P>Carwin's agency was here easily recognized. I had besought him to interpose in my defence. He had flown. I had imagined him deaf to my prayer, and resolute to see me perish: yet he disappeared merely to devise and execute the means of my re∣lief.</P>
<P>Why did he not forbear when this end was ac∣complished? Why did his misjudging zeal and ac∣cursed
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
precipitation overpass that limit? Or meant he thus to crown the scene, and conduct his inscru∣table plots to this consummation?</P>
<P>Such ideas were the fruit of subsequent contem∣plation. This moment was pregnant with fate. I had no power to reason. In the career of my tem∣pestuous thoughts, rent into pieces, as my mind was, by accumulating horrors, Carwin was unseen and unsuspected. I partook of Wieland's creduli∣ty, shook with his amazement, and panted with his awe.</P>
<P>Silence took place for a moment; so much as allowed the attention to recover its post. Then new sounds were uttered from above.</P>
<P>"Man of errors! cease to cherish thy delusion: not heaven or hell, but thy senses have misled thee to commit these acts. Shake off thy phrenzy, and ascend into rational and human. Be lunatic no longer."</P>
<P>My brother opened his lips to speak. His tone was terrific and faint. He muttered an appeal to heaven. It was difficult to comprehend the theme of his inquiries. They implied doubt as to the na∣ture of the impulse that hitherto had guided him, and questioned whether he had acted in consequence of insane perceptions.</P>
<P>To these interrogatories the voice, which now seemed to hover at his shoulder, loudly answered in the affirmative. Then uninterrupted silence en∣sued.</P>
<P>Fallen from his losty and heroic station; now finally restored to the perception of truth; weighed to earth by the recollection of his own deeds; con∣soled no longer by a consciousness of rectitude, for the loss of offspring and wife—a loss for which he was indebted to his own misguided hand; Wie∣land
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
was transformed at once into the <HI>man of sor∣rows!</HI></P>
<P>He reflected not that credit should be as reason∣ably denied to the last, as to any former intimation; that one might as justly be ascribe to erring or diseased senses as the other. He saw not that this discovery in no degree affected the integrity of his conduct; that his motives had lost none of their claims to the homage of mankind; that the prefe∣rence of supreme good, and the boundless energy of duty, were undiminished in his bosom.</P>
<P>It is not for me to pursue him through the ghastly changes of his countenance. Words he had none. Now he sat upon the floor, motionless in all his limbs, with his eyes glazed and fixed; a monument of woe.</P>
<P>Anon a spirit of tempestuous but undesigning activity seized him. He rose from his place and strode across the floor, tottering and at random. His eyes were without moisture, and gleamed with the fire that consumed his vitals. The muscles of his face were agitated by convulsion. His lips moved, but no sound escaped him.</P>
<P>That nature should long sustain this conflict was not to be believed. My state was little different from that of my brother. I entered, as it were, into his thought. My heart was visited and rent by his pangs—Oh that thy phrenzy had never been cured! that thy madness, with its blissful visions, would return! or, if that must not be, that thy scene would hasten to a close! that death would cover thee with his oblivion!</P>
<P>What can I wish for thee? Thou who hast vied with the great preacher of thy faith in sanctity of motives, and in elevation above sensual and self∣ish! Thou whom thy fate has changed into pari∣cide
<PB N="282" REF="284"/>
and savage! Can I wish for the continuance of thy being? No.</P>
<P>For a time his movements seemed destitute of purpose. If he walked; if he turned; if his fingers were entwined with each other; if his hands were pressed against opposite sides of his head with a force sufficient to crush it into pieces; it was to tear his mind from self-contemplation; to waste his thoughts on external objects.</P>
<P>Speedily this train was broken. A beam ap∣peared to be darted into h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s mind, which gave a purpose to his efforts. An avenue to escape pre∣sented itself: and now he eagerly gazed about him: when my thoughts became engaged by his demea∣nour, my fingers were stretched as by a mechani∣cal force, and the knife, no longer heeded or of use, escaped from my grasp, and fell unperceived on the floor. His eye now lighted upon it; he seized it with the quickness of thought.</P>
<P>I shrieked aloud, but it was too late. He plunged it to the hilt in his neck; and his life instantly escaped with the stream that gushed from the wound. He was stretched at my feet; and my hands were sprinkled with his blood as he fell.</P>
<P>Such was thy last deed, my brother! For a spec∣tacle like this was it my fate to be reserved! Thy eyes were closed—thy face ghastly with death— thy arms, and the spot where thou liedest, floated in thy life's blood! These images have not, for a moment, forsaken me. Till I am breathless and cold, they must continue to hover in my sight.</P>
<P>Carwin, as I said, had left the room, but he still lingered in the house. My voice summoned him to my aid, but I scarcely noticed his re-entrance, and now faintly recollect his terrified looks, his broken exclamations, his vehement avowals of in∣nocence,
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
the effusions of his pity for me, and his offers of assistance.</P>
<P>I did not listen—I answered him not—I ceased to upbraid or accuse. His guilt was a point to which I was indifferent. Ruffian or devil, black as hell or bright as angels, thenceforth he was no∣thing to me. I was incapable of sparing a look or a thought from the ruin that was spread at my feet.</P>
<P>When he left me, I was scarcely conscious of any variation in the scene. He informed the inha∣bitants of the hut of what had passed, and they flew to the spot. Careless of his own safety, he hasted to the city to inform my friends of my con∣dition.</P>
<P>My uncle speedily arrived at the house. The body of Wieland was removed from my presence, and they supposed that I would follow it; but no, my home is ascertained; here I have taken up my rest, and never will I go hence, till, like Wieland, I am borne to my grave.</P>
<P>Importunity was tried in vain: they threatened to remove me by violence—nay, violence was used; but my soul prizes too dearly this little roof to en∣dure to be bereaved of it. Force should not pre∣vail when the hoary locks and supplicating tears of my uncle were ineffectual. My repugnance to move gave birth to ferociousness and phrenzy when force was employed, and they were obliged to con∣sent to my return.</P>
<P>They besought me—they remonstrated—they appealed to every duty that connected me with him that made me, and with my fellow-men—in vain. While I live I will not go hence. Have I not ful∣filled my destiny?</P>
<P>Why will ye torment me with your reasonings and reproofs? Can ye restore to me the hope of
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
my better days? Can ye give me back Catharine and her babes? Can ye recall to life him who died at my feet?</P>
<P>I will eat — I will drink— I will lie down and rise up at your bidding—all I ask is the choice of my abode. What is there unreasonable in this de∣mand? Shortly will I be at peace. This is the spot which I have chosen in which to breathe my last sigh. Deny me not, I beseech you, so flight a boon.</P>
<P>Talk not to me, O my revered friend! of Car∣win. He has told thee his tale, and thou excul∣patest him from all direct concern in the fate of Wieland. This scene of havock was produced by an illusion of the senses. Be it so: I care not from what source these disaster have flowed; it suffices that they have swallowed up our hopes and our existence.</P>
<P>What his agency began, his agency conducted to a close. He intended, by the final effort of his power, to rescue me and to banish his illusions from my brother. Such is his tale, concerning the truth of which I care not. Henceforth I foster but one wish—I ask only quick deliverance from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and all the ills that attend it.—</P>
<P>Go wretch! torment me n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with thy presence and thy prayers,—Forgive thee? Will that avail thee when thy fateful hour shall arrive? Be thou acquitted at thy own tribunal, and thou needest not fear the verdict of others, if thy guilt be capable of blacker hues, if hitherto thy conscience be with∣out stain, thy crime will be made more flagrant by thus violating my retreat. Take thyself away from my sight if thou wouldest not behold my death!</P>
<P>Thou art gone! murmuring and reluctant! And now my repose is coming —my work is done!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Written three years after the foregoing, and dated at Montpellier.]</HEAD>
<P>I Imagined that I had forever laid aside the pen; and that I should take up my abode in this part of the world, was of all events the least probable. My destiny I believed to be accomplished, and I looked forward to a speedy termination of my life with the fullest confidence.</P>
<P>Surely I had reason to be weary of existence, to be impatient of every tie which held me from the grave. I experienced this impatience in its fullest extent. I was not only enamoured of death, but conceived, from the condition of my frame, that to shun it was impossible, even though I had ar∣dently desired it; yet here am I, a thousand leagues from my native soil, in full possession of life and of health, and not destitute of happiness.</P>
<P>Such is man. Time will obliterate the deepest impressions. Grief the most vehement and hope∣less, will gradually decay and wear itself out. Ar∣guments may be employed in vain: every moral prescription may be ineffectually tried: remon∣strances, however cogent or pathetic, shall have no power over the attention, or shall be repelled with disdain; yet, as day follows day, the turbulence of our emotions shall subside, and our fluctuations be finally succeeded by a calm.</P>
<P>Perhaps, however, the conquest of despair was chiefly owing to an accident which rendered my
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
continuance in my own house impossible. At the conclusion of my long, and, as I then supposed, my last letter to you, I mentioned my resolution to wait for death in the very spot which had been the principal scene of my misfortunes. From this resolution my friends exerted themselves with the utmost zeal and perseverance to make me depart. They justly imagined that to be thus surrounded by memorials of the fate of my family, would tend to foster my disease. A swift succession of new ob∣jects, and the exclusion of every thing calculated to remind me of my loss, was the only method of cure.</P>
<P>I refused to listen to their exhortations. Great as my calamity was, to be torn from this asylum was regarded by me as an aggravation of it. By a per∣verse constitution of mind, he was considered as my greatest enemy who sought to withdraw me from a scene which supplied eternal food to my melancho∣ly, and kept my despair from languishing.</P>
<P>In relating the history of these disasters I derived a similar species of gratification. My uncle ear∣nestly dissuaded me from this task; but his remon∣strances were as fruitless on this head as they had been on others. They would have withheld from me the implements of writing; but they quickly perceived that to withstand would be more injurious than to comply with my wishes. Having finished my tale, it seemed as if the scene were closing. A fever lurked in my veins, and my strength was gone. Any exertion, however slight, was attended with difficulty, and, at length, I refused to rise from my bed.</P>
<P>I now see the infatuation and injustice of my conduct in its true colours. I reflect upon the sensations and reasonings of that period with won∣der
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
and humiliation. That I should be insensible to the claims and tears of my friends; that I should overlook the suggestions of duty, and fly from that post in which only I could be instrumental to the benefit of others; that the exercise of the social and beneficent affections, the contemplation of na∣ture and the acquisition of wisdom should not be seen to be means of happiness still within my reach, is, at this time, scarcely credible.</P>
<P>It is true that I am now changed; but I have not the consolation to reflect that my change was owing to my fortitude or to my capacity for in∣struction. Better thoughts grew up in my mind imperceptibly. I cannot but congratulate myself on the change, though, perhaps, it merely argues a fickleness of temper, and a defect of sensibility.</P>
<P>After my narrative was ended I betook myself to my bed, in the full belief that my career in this world was on the point of finishing. My uncle took up his abode with me, and performed for me every office of nurse, physician and friend. One night, after some hours of restlessness and pain, I sunk into deep sleep. Its tranquillity, however, was of no long duration. My fancy became suddenly dis∣tempered, and my brain was turned into a theatre of uproar and confusion. It would not be easy to describe the wild and phantastical incongruities that pestered me. My uncle, Wieland, Pleyel and Carwin were successively and momently discerned amidst the storm. Sometimes I was swallowed up by whirlpools, or caught up in the air by half-seen and gigantic forms, and thrown upon pointed rocks, or cast among the billows. Sometimes gleams of light were shot into a dark abyss, on the verge of which I was standing, and enabled me to discover, for a moment, its enormous depth and hideous pre∣cipices.
<PB N="288" REF="290"/>
Anon, I was transported to some ridge of Aetna, and made a terrified spectator of its fiery torrents and its pillars of smoke.</P>
<P>However strange it may seem, I was conscious, even during my dream, of my real situation. I knew myself to be asleep, and struggled to break the spell, by muscular exertions. These did not avail, and I continued to suffer these abortive cre∣ations till a loud voice, at my bed side, and some one shaking me with violence, put an end to my reverie. My eyes were unsealed, and I started from my pillow.</P>
<P>My chamber was filled with smoke, which, though in some degree luminous, would permit me to see nothing, and by which I was nearly suffocat∣ed. The crackling of flames, and the deafening clamour of voices without, burst upon my ears. Stunned as I was by this hubbub, scorched with heat, and nearly choaked by the accumulating va∣pours, I was unable to think or act for my own preservation; I was incapable, indeed, of compre∣hending my danger.</P>
<P>I was caught up, in an instant, by a pair of sinewy arms, borne to the window, and carried down a ladder which had been placed there. My uncle stood at the bottom and received me. I was not fully aware of my situation till I found myself sheltered in the <HI>Hut,</HI> and surrounded by its inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>By neglect of the servant, some unextinguished embers had been placed in a barrel in the cellar of the building. The barrel had caught fire; this was communicated to the beams of the lower floor, and thence to the upper part of the structure. It was first discovered by some persons at a distance, who hastened to the spot and alarmed my uncle and the
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
servants. The flames had already made consider∣able progress, and my condition was overlooked till my escape was rendered nearly impossible.</P>
<P>My danger being known, and a ladder quickly procured, one of the spectators ascended to my chamber, and effected my deliverance in the man∣ner before related.</P>
<P>This incident, disastrous as it may at first seem, had, in reality, a beneficial effect upon my feel∣ings. I was, in some degree, roused from the stupor which had seized my faculties. The monotonous and gloomy series of my thoughts was broken. My habitation was levelled with the ground, and I was obliged to seek a new one. A new train of images, disconnected with the fate of my family, forced itself on my attention, and a belief insensi∣bly sprung up, that tranquillity, if not happiness, was still within my reach. Notwithstanding the shocks which my frame had endured, the anguish of my thoughts no sooner abated than I recovered my health.</P>
<P>I now willingly listened to my uncle's solicita∣tions to be the companion of his voyage. Prepa∣rations were easily made, and after a tedious pas∣sage, we set our feet on the shore of the ancient world. The memory of the past did not forsake me; but the melancholy which it generated, and the tears with which it filled my eyes, were not un∣profitable. My curiosity was revived, and I con∣templated, with ardour, the spectacle of living manners and the monuments of past ages.</P>
<P>In proportion as my heart was reinstated in the possession of its ancient tranquillity, the sentiment which I had cherished with regard to Pleyel re∣turned. In a short time he was united to the Saxon woman, and made his residence in the neighbour∣hood
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
of Boston. I was glad that circumstances would not permit an interview to take place be∣tween us. I could not desire their misery; but I reaped no pleasure from reflecting on their happi∣ness. Time, and the exertions of my fortitude, cured me, in some degree, of this folly. I conti∣nued to love him, but my passion was diguised to myself; I considered it merely as a more tender species of friendship, and cherished it without com∣punction.</P>
<P>Through my uncle's exertions a meeting was brought about between Carwin and Pleyel, and explanations took place which restored me at once to the good opinion of the latter. Though separated so widely our correspondence was punctual and fre∣quent, and paved the way for that union which can only end with the death of one of us.</P>
<P>In my letters to him I made no secret of my for∣mer sentiments. This was a theme on which I could talk without painful, though not without de∣licate emotions. That knowledge which I should never have imparted to a lover, I felt little scruple to communicate to a friend.</P>
<P>A year and an half elapsed when Theresa was snatched from him by death, in the hour in which she gave him the first pledge of their mutual affec∣tion. This event was borne by him with his cus∣tomary fortitude. It induced him, however, to make a change in his plans. He disposed of his property in America, and joined my uncle and me, who had terminated the wanderings of two years at Montpellier, which will henceforth, I believe, be our permanent abode.</P>
<P>If you reflect upon that entire confidence which had subsisted from our infancy between Pleyel and myself; on the passion that I had contracted, and
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
which was merely smothered for a time; and on the esteem which was mutual, you will not, per∣haps, be surprized that the renovation of our in∣tercourse should give birth to that union which at present subsists. When the period had elapsed ne∣cessary to weaken the remembrance of Theresa, to whom he had been bound by ties more of honor than of love, he tendered his affections to me. I need not add that the tender was eagerly accepted.</P>
<P>Perhaps you are somewhat interested in the fate of Carwin. He saw, when too late, the danger of imposture. So much affected was he by the catastrophe to which he was a witness, that he laid aside all regard to his own safety. He sought my uncle, and confided to him the tale which he had just related to me. He found a more impartial and indulgent auditor in Mr. Cambridge, who im∣puted to maniacal illusion the conduct of Wieland, though he conceived the previous and unseen agency of Carwin, to have indirectly but powerfully pre∣disposed to this deplorable perversion of mind.</P>
<P>It was easy for Carwin to elude the persecutions of Ludloe. It was merely requisite to hide him∣self in a remote district of Pennsylvania. This, when he parted from us, he determined to do. He is now probably engaged in the harmless pursuits of agriculture, and may come to think, without in∣supportable remorse, on the evils to which his fatal talents have given birth. The innocence and use∣fulness of his future life may, in some degree, atone for the miseries so rashly or so thoughtlessly in∣flicted.</P>
<P>More urgent considerations hindered me from mentioning, in the course of my former mournful recital, any particulars respecting the unfortunate father of Louisa Conway. That man surely was
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
reserved to be a monument of capricious fortune. His southern journies being finished, he returned to Philadelphia. Before he reached the city he left the highway, and alighted at my brother's door. Contrary to his expectation, no one came forth to welcome him, or hail his approach. He attempted to enter the house, but bolted doors, barred win∣dows, and a silence broken only by unanswered calls, shewed him that the mansion was deserted.</P>
<P>He proceeded thence to my habitation, which he found, in like manner, gloomy and tenantless. His surprize may be easily conceived. The rustics who occupied the hut told him an imperfect and incre∣dible tale. He hasted to the city, and extorted from Mrs. Baynton a full disclosure of late dis∣asters.</P>
<P>He was inured to adversity, and recovered, after no long time, from the shocks produced by this disappointment of his darling scheme. Our inter∣course did not terminate with his departure from America. We have since met with him in France, and light has at length been thrown upon the mo∣tives which occasioned the disappearance of his wife, in the manner which I formerly related to you.</P>
<P>I have dwelt upon the ardour of their conjugal attachment, and mentioned that no suspicion had ever glanced upon her purity. This, though the belief was long cherished, recent discoveries have shewn to be questionable. No doubt her integrity would have survived to the present moment, if an extraordinary fate had not befallen her.</P>
<P>Major Stuart had been engaged, while in Ger∣many, in a contest of honor with an Aid de Camp of the Marquis of Granby. His adversary had propagated a rumour injurious to his character. A challenge was sent: a meeting ensued▪ and Stuart
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
wounded and disarmed the calumniator. The of∣fence was atoned for, and his life secured by suit∣able concessions.</P>
<P>Maxwell, that was his name, shortly after, in consequence of succeeding to a rich inheritance, sold his commission and returned to London. His fortune was speedily augmented by an opulent mar∣riage. Interest was his sole inducement to this marriage, though the lady had been swayed by a credulous affection. The true state of his heart was quickly discovered, and a separation, by mu∣tual consent, took place. The lady withdrew to an estate in a distant county, and Maxwell con∣tinued to consume his time and fortune in the dis∣sipation of the capital.</P>
<P>Maxwell, though deceitful and sensual, possessed great force of mind and specious accomplishments. He contrived to mislead the generous mind of Stu∣art, and to regain the esteem which his misconduct, for a time, had forfeited. He was recommended by her husband to the confidence of Mrs. Stuart. Maxwell was stimulated by revenge, and by a law∣less passion, to convert this confidence into a source of guilt.</P>
<P>The education and capacity of this woman, the worth of her husband, the pledge of their alliance which time had produced, her maturity in age and knowledge of the world—all combined to render this attempt hopeless. Maxwell, however, was not easily discouraged. The most perfect being, he believed, must owe his exemption from vice to the absence of temptation. The impulses of love are so subtile, and the influence of false reasoning, when enforced by eloquence and passion, so unbounded, that no human virtue is secure from degeneracy.
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
All arts being tried, every temptation being sum∣moned to his aid, dissimulation being carried to its utmost bound, Maxwell, at length, nearly accom∣plished his purpose. The lady's affections were withdrawn from her husband and transferred to him. She could not, as yet, be reconciled to dishonor. All efforts to induce her to elope with him were in∣effectual. She permitted herself to love, and to avow her love; but at this limit she stopped, and was immoveable.</P>
<P>Hence this revolution in her sentiments was pro∣ductive only of despair. Her rectitude of principle preserved her from actual guilt, but could not re∣store to her her ancient affection, or save her from being the prey of remorseful and impracticable wishes. Her husband's absence produced a state of suspence. This, however, approached to a pe∣riod, and she received tidings of his intended return. Maxwell, being likewise apprized of this event, and having made a last and unsuccessful effort to con∣quer her reluctance to accompany him in a journey to Italy, whither he pretended an invincible necessity of going, left her to pursue the measures which despair might suggest. At the same time she re∣ceived a letter from the wife of Maxwell, unveiling the true character of this man, and revealing facts which the artifices of her seducer had hitherto con∣cealed from her. Mrs. Maxwell had been prompted to this disclosure by a knowledge of her husband's practices, with which his own impetuosity had made her acquainted.</P>
<P>This discovery, joined to the delicacy of her scru∣ples and the anguish of remorse, induced her to abscond. This scheme was adopted in haste, but effected with consummate prudence. She fled, on
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
the eve of her husband's arrival, in the disguise of a boy, and embarked at Falmouth in a packet bound for America.</P>
<P>The history of her disastrous intercourse with Maxwell, the motives inducing her to forsake her country, and the measures she had taken to effect her design▪ were related to Mrs. Maxwell, in reply to her communication. Between these women an ancient intimacy and considerable similitude of cha∣racter subsisted. This disclosure was accompanied with solemn injunctions of secrecy, and these in∣junctions were, for a long time, faithfully observed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Maxwell's abode was situated on the banks of the Wey. Stuart was her kinsman; their youth had been spent together; and Maxwell was in some degree indebted to the man whom he be∣trayed, for his alliance with this unfortunate lady. Her esteem for the character of Stuart had never been diminished. A meeting between them was occasioned by a tour which the latter had underta∣ken, in the year after his return from America, to Wales and the western counties. This interview produced pleasure and regret in each. Their own transactions naturally became the topics of their conversation; and the untimely fate of his wife and daughter were related by the guest.</P>
<P>Mrs. Maxwell's regard for her friend, as well as for the safety of her husband, persuaded her to con∣cealment; but the former being dead, and the latter being out of the kingdom, she ventured to produce Mrs. Stuart's letter, and to communicate her own knowledge of the treachery of Maxwell. She had previously extorted from her guest a promise not to pursue any scheme of vengeance; but this promise was made while ignorant of the full extent of Max∣well's
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
depravity, and his passion refused to adhere to it.</P>
<P>At this time my uncle and I resided at Avignon. Among the English resident there, and with whom we maintained a social intercourse, was Maxwell. This man's talents and address rendered him a fa∣vorite both with my uncle and myself. He had even tendered me his hand in marriage; but this being refused, he had sought and obtained permission to continue with us the intercourse of friendship. Since a legal marriage was impossible, no doubt, his views were flagitious. Whether he had relin∣quished these views I was unable to judge.</P>
<P>He was one in a large circle at a villa in the en∣virons, to which I had likewise been invited, when Stuart abruptly entered the apartment. He was recognized with genuine satisfaction by me, and with seeming pleasure by Maxwell. In a short time, some affair of moment being pleaded, which required an immediate and exclusive interview, Maxwell and he withdrew together. Stuart and my uncle had been known to each other in the German army; and the purpose contemplated by the former in this long and hasty journey, was con∣fided to his old friend.</P>
<P>A defiance was given and received, and the banks of a rivulet, about a league from the city, was se∣lected as the scene of this contest. My uncle, hav∣ing exerted himself in vain to prevent an hostile meeting, consented to attend them as a surgeon.— Next morning, at sun-rise, was the time ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en.</P>
<P>I returned early in the evening to my lodgings. Preliminaries being settled between the combatants, Stuart had consented to spend the evening with us, and did not retire till late. On the way to his hotel

he was exposed to no molestation, but just as he stepped within the portico, a swarthy and malignant figure started from behind a column, and plunged a stiletto into his body.</P>
<P>The author of this treason could not certainly be discovered; but the details communicated by Stuart, respecting the history of Maxwell, naturally pointed him out as an object of suspicion. No one expres∣sed more concern, on account of this disaster, than he; and he pretended an ardent zeal to vindicate his character from the aspersions that were cast upon it. Thenceforth, however, I denied myself to his visits; and shortly after he disappeared from this scene.</P>
<P>Few possessed more estimable qualities, and a better title to happiness and the tranquil honors of long life, than the mother and father of Louisa Conway: yet they were cut off in the bloom of their days; and their destiny was thus accomplished by the same hand. Maxwell was the instrument of their destruction, though the instrument was ap∣plied to this end in so different a manner.</P>
<P>I leave you to moralize on this tale. That vir∣tue should become the victim of treachery is, no doubt, a mournful consideration; but it will not escape your notice, that the evils of which Car∣win and Maxwell were the authors, owed their existence to the errors of the sufferers. All ef∣forts would have been ineffectual to subvert the happiness or shorten the existence of the Stuarts, if their own frailty had not seconded these efforts. If the lady had crushed her disastrous passion in the bud, and driven the seducer from her presence, when the tendency of his artifices was seen; if Stuart had not admitted the spirit of absurd revenge, we

should not have had to deplore this catastrophe. If Wieland had framed juster notions of moral duty, and of the divine attributes; or if I had been gifted with ordinary equanimity or foresight, the double-tongued deceiver would have been baffled and re∣pelled.</P>
