<P>THE following Papers were publish'd, and se∣veral of 'em written, by a Gentleman now Abroad. Many of 'em came from the same Hands which contributed to the other Volumes, several of which (I fancy) will easily distinguish themselves to have been the Pro∣ductions of a Gentleman lately dead; one who, to the Advan∣tages of a large Estate and good Education, had acquir'd Learn∣ing and an exact Knowledge of the best Sort of Men both at
<PB REF="3"/>
Home and Abroad; and with∣al, was Master of so much Wit and Humour, that there are few People whose Conversations could be more desirable. His Friends and the Publick equal∣ly regret his Loss, since he was serviceable and agreeable to 'em both in a very eminent De∣gree. The rest of these Papers are to live upon what Commen∣dations they can give them∣selves, and perhaps may be thought not altogether unwor∣thy of the Honour of serving as a Supplement to the former Volumes.</P>

<P>'TIS impossible perhaps for the best and wisest amongst us, to keep so constant a Guard upon our Temper, but that we may at one Time or other lie open to the Strokes of Fortune, and such Incidents as we cannot foresee. With Sentiments of this Kind I came Home to my Lodgings last Night, much fatigued with a long and sudden Journey from the Country, and full of the ungrateful Occa∣sion of it. 'Twas natural for me to have im∣mediate Recourse to my Pen and Ink; but be∣fore I would offer to make Use of them, I re∣solv'd deliberately to tell over a Hundred, and when I came to the End of that Sum, I found it more advisable to defer drawing up my in∣tended Remonstrance, till I had slept soundly on my Resentments. Without any other Pre∣face
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
than this, I shall give the World a fair Account of the Treatment I have lately met with, and leave them to judge, whether the Uneasiness I have suffer'd be inconsistent with the Character I have generally pretended to. About Three Weeks since, I receiv'd an Invita∣tion from a Kinsman in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> to spend my <HI>Christmas</HI> in those Parts. Upon taking Leave of Mr. <HI>Morphew,</HI> I put as many Papers into his Hands as would serve till my Return and charg'd him at parting, to be very punctual with the Town. In what Manner he and Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> have been tamper'd with since, I can∣not say, they have given me my Revenge, if I desired any, by allowing their Names to an idle Paper, that in all humane Probability, cannot live a Fortnight to an End. My self, and the Family I was with, were in the Midst of Gaie∣ty, and a plentiful Entertainment, when I re∣ceiv'd a Letter from my Sister <HI>Jenny,</HI> who, af∣ter mentioning some little Affairs I had intru∣sted to her, goes on thus: <Q REND="inline">"The inclos'd, I be∣lieve, will give you some Surprize, as it has al∣ready astonish'd every Body here: Who Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> is, that subscribes it, I don't know, any more than I can comprehend what could induce him to it. <HI>Morphew</HI> and <HI>Lillie,</HI> I am told, are both in the Secret. I shall not presume to instruct you, but hope you will use some Means to dis∣appoint the ill Nature of those who are taking Pains to deprive the World of one of its most reasonable Entertainments. I am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I am to thank my Sister for her Compli¦ment; but be that as it will, I shall not easily be discourag'd from my former Undertaking<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In Pursuance of it, I was obliged upon this Notice to take Places in the Coach for my self and my Maid with the utmost Expedition, lest I should, in a short Time, be rallied out of my Existence, as some People will needs fancy
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> has been, and the real <HI>Isaac Bic∣kerstaff</HI> have passed for a Creature of Mr. <HI>Steele</HI>'s Imagination. This Illusion might have hoped for some tolerable Success, if I had not more than once produced my Person in a crowded Theatre; and such a Person as Mr. <HI>Steele,</HI> if I am not misinformed in the Gentleman, would hardly think it an Advantage to own, though I should throw him in all the little Honour I have gained by my <HI>Lucubrations.</HI> I may be al∣lowed, perhaps, to understand Pleasantry as well as other Men, and can (in the usual Phrase) take a Jest without being angry; but I appeal to the World, whether the Gentleman has not carried it too far, and whether he ought not to make a publick Recantation, if the Cre∣dulity of some unthinking People should force me to insist upon it. The following Letter is just come to Hand, and I think it not improper to be inserted in this Paper.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am extreamly glad to hear you are come to Town, for in your Absence we were all mightily surprized with an unaccountable Pa∣per, Sign'd, <HI>Richard Steele,</HI> who is esteem'd by those that know him, to be a Man of Wit and Honour; and therefore we took it either to be a Counterseit, or a perfect <HI>Christmas</HI> Frolick of that ingenious Gentleman. But then, your Paper ceasing immediately after; we were at a Loss what to think: If you were weary of the Work you had so long carried on, and had given this Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> Orders to sig∣nify so to the Publick, he should have said it in plain Terms; but as that Paper is worded, one would be apt to judge, that he had a Mind to perswade the Town that there was some Analogy between <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> and him-Possibly
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Possibly there may be a Secret in this which I cannot enter into; but I flatter my self that you never had any Thoughts of giving over your Labours for the Benefit of Mankind, when you cannot but know how many Subjects are yet unexhausted, and how many others, as being less obvious, are wholly untouch'd. I dare promise, not only for my self, but many other abler Friends, that we shall still continue to furnish you with Hints on all proper Occa∣sions, which is all your Genius requires. I think, by the Way, you cannot in Honour have any more to do with <HI>Morphew</HI> and <HI>Lillie,</HI> who have gone beyond the ordinary Pitch of Assu∣rance, and transgress'd the very Letter of the Proverb, by endeavouring to cheat you of your Christian and Sirname too. Wishing you, Sir, long to live for our Instruction and Diversion, and to the defeating of all Impostors, I re∣main,</P>

<P>I Remember <HI>Menage</HI> tells a Story of Monsieur <HI>Racan,</HI> who had appointed a Day and Hour to meet a certain Lady of great Wit whom he had never seen, in order to make an Acquaintance between them. <Q REND="inline">'Two of <HI>Racan</HI>'s Friends, who had heard of the Appointment resolved to play him a Trick. The first went to the Lady two Hours before the Time, said his Name was <HI>Racan,</HI> and talk'd with her an Hour; they were both mightily pleased, began a great Friendship, and parted with much Satisfaction. A few Minutes after comes the Second, and sends up the same Name; the Lady wonders at the Meaning, and tells him, Mr. <HI>Racan</HI> had just left her. The Gentleman says it was some ras∣cally Impostor, and that he had been frequent∣ly us'd in that Manner. The Lady is convinc'd, and they laugh at the Oddness of the Adven∣tures. She now calls to Mind several Passages which confirms her that the former was a Cheat. He appoints a Second Meeting, and takes his Leave. He was no sooner gone, but the true <HI>Racan</HI> comes to the Door, and desires, under that Name, to see the Lady. She was
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
out of all Patience, sends for him up, rates him for an Impostor, and, after a Thousand Inju∣ries, flings a Slipper at his Head. It was im∣possible to pacify or disabuse her; he was for∣ced to retire, and it was not without some Time, and the Intervention of Friends, that they could come to an Eclaircisement."</Q> This, as I take it, is exactly the Case with Mr. <HI>S—le,</HI> the pretended TATLER from <HI>Morphew,</HI> and my self, only (I presume) the World will be sooner undeceiv'd than the Lady in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nage.</HI> The very Day my last Paper came out, my Printer brought me another of the same Date, call'd the TAT∣LER, by <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and, which was still more pleasant, with an Advertisement at the End, calling me the <HI>Female</HI> TATLER: It is not enough to rob me of my Name, but now they must impose a Sex on me, when my Years have long since determin'd me to be of none at all. There is only one Thing wanting in the Opera∣tion, that they would renew my Age, and then I will heartily forgive them all the rest. In the mean Time, whatever Uneasiness I have suffer'd from the little Malice of these Men, and my Re∣tirement in the Country, the Pleasures I have re∣ceiv'd from the same Occasion, will fairly bal∣lance the Account. On the one Hand I have been highly delighted to see my Name and Character assumed by the Scribblers of the Age, in order to recommend themselves to it; and on the other, to observe the good Taste of the Town, in di∣stinguishing and exploding them through every Disguise, and sacrificing their Trifles to the sup∣posed <HI>Manes</HI> of <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> Esquire. But the greatest Merit of my Journey into <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> is, that it has open'd to me a new Fund of unre∣prov'd Follies and Errors that have hitherto lain out of my View, and, by their Situation, escap'd my Censure. For, as I have liv'd generally in Town, the Images I had of the Country were
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
such only as my Senses receiv'd very early, and my Memory has since preserv'd with all the Ad∣vantages they first appear'd in.</P>
<P>Hence it was that I thought our Parish-Church the noblest Structure in <HI>England,</HI> and the 'Squire's Place-House, as we call'd it, a most magnificent Palace. I had the same Opinion of the Alms-House in the Church-yard, and of a Bridge over the Brook that parts our Parish from the next. 'Twas the common Vogue of our School, That the Master was the best Scholar in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Usher the Second. Not happening to correct these Notions by comparing them with what I saw when I came into the World, upon return∣ing back, I began to resume my former Imagi∣nations, and expected all Things should appear in the same View as I left them when I was a Boy: But to my utter Disappointment I found them wonderfully shrunk, and lessen'd almost out of my Knowledge. I look'd with Contempt on the Tribes painted on the Church Walls, which I once so much admired, and on the carv'd Chimney-Piece in the 'Squire's Hall. I found my old Master to be a poor ignorant Pedant; and, in short, the whole Scene to be extreamly chang'd for the worse. This I could not help mention∣ing, because though it be of no Consequence in it self, yet 'tis certain, that most Prejudices are contracted and retained by this narrow Way of Thinking, which in Matters of the greatest Mo∣ment are hardly shook off; and which we only think true, because we were made to believe so, before we were capable to distinguish between Truth and Falshood. But there was one Prepos∣session which I confess to have parted with, much to my Regret: I mean the Opinion of that na∣tive Honesty and Simplicity of Manners which I had always imagin'd to be inherent in Country People. I soon observ'd it was with them and us, as they say of Animals; That every Species
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
at Land, has one to resemble it at Sea; for 'twas easy to discover the Seeds and Principles of every Vice and Folly that one meets with in the more known World, though shooting up in different Forms. I took a Fancy out of the several Inha∣bitants round, to furnish the Camp; the Bar, and the Exchange, and some certain Chocolate and Coffee-houses, with exact Parallels to what, in many Instances, they already produce. There was a drunken quarrelsome <HI>Smith,</HI> whom I have a hundred Times fancied at the Head of a Troop of Dragoons. A Weaver, within two Doors of my Kinsman, was perpetually setting Neighbours together by the Ears. I lamented to see how his Talents were misplac'd, and imagin'd what a Fi∣gure he might make in <HI>Westminster-hall.</HI> Good∣man <HI>Crop</HI> of <HI>Compton-Farm,</HI> wants nothing but a Plumb and a Gold-Chain to qualify him for the Government of the City. My Kinsman's Stable-Boy was a gibbing Companion that would always have his Jest. He would often put Cow-itch in the Maids Bed, pull Stools from under Folks, and lay a Coal upon their Shoes when they were a∣sleep. He was at last turn'd off for some notable Piece of Roguery, and when I came away, was loitering among the Ale-houses. Bless me, thought I, what a prodigious Wit would this have been with us! I could have match'd all the Sharpers between St. <HI>James</HI>'s and <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> with a notable Fellow in the same Neighbour∣hood, (since hang'd for picking Pockets at Fairs) could he have had the Advantages of their Edu∣cation. So nearly are the Corruptions of the Country ally'd to those of the Town, with no further Difference than what is made by another Turn of Thought and Method of Living.</P>
<P>Many more Grievances, though not of equal Importance, have been laid before me from seve∣ral Parts of this Kingdom, which, as they fall not under any ones Cognizance so properly as
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
my own, oblige me to a speedy and effectual Re∣gulation of them. When I was prevail'd upon to, act as Censor of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I did not enough, consider the Extent of that Province, nor how, difficult it would be to make my Authority un∣derstood in the remoter Parts of this Island; for most of the Natives being Strangers to Litera∣ture, I cannot hope my Lucubrations should meet with a general Reception amongst them; and therefore I have now resolved on an Expe∣dient, which I shall explain by the following Or∣der.</P>

<P>WHereas I have from many Parts of the Kingdom, as well Villages as Country Towns, receiv'd credible Information of several Innovations, Abuses, and Offences, lately crept into them, much derogating from their Ho∣nour, nor less pernicious to the Quiet of So∣ciety, and at the same Time not punishable by any Law, Common or Municipal, as yet in Force; and whereas my Age, growing Infir∣mities, and necessary Residence in this Place, will not give me Leave to come in Person, and put a Stop to these Evils: I do hereby charge and require you, and every one of you, within Five Days after Receipt of this, to repair forth∣with to the Vestry, or what other Place shall to your Wisdom seem most proper; there to chuse, elect, and nominate, some candid, so∣ber, and understanding Person, being not a∣bove the Dignity of a Squire, nor under that of Clerk of the Parish, aged Fifty Years at

<P>WHen I left the Town, as I said before, I did not only make a sufficient Provision for the Continuance of my Lucubrations, till the Time I had fix'd for my Return, but took Care to substitute one, who in case my Stay should happen to be longer than I design'd, would much better have furnished out the usual Entertain∣ment the Publick expected from me. <HI>Sam Trusty,</HI> of whom I made Mention in a former Paper, was the Person I pitched upon to execute that Of∣fice. Fifty Years and upwards we have liv'd in so strict an Intimacy, in so perfect an Union, that neither Times, Interest, Passions nor Opinions, have ever been able to make the least Flaw in our Friendship. I am not ashamed to own I have received more Advantage from his Conver∣sation, than from all the Academick Exercises; 'tis to his Instructions I owe the Improvement of my Understanding, to his Precepts and Example the forming of my Manners; and to his Obser∣vations, the principal Remarks I have made up∣on the several States and Conditions of Mankind. As his Genius at our first setting out in the World, was much above mine, so he has ever since maintained the same Superiority. His Words were always few, his Arguments weighty, his Reflections just, his Intentions sincere, and his Connexions were mixed with such an agreeable Mirth, that I have often taken Pleasure in put∣ting my self in the Wrong, on purpose to excite him to so delightful a Reproof. A' sudden Indis∣position
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
defeated me of his Assistance, and has exposed me to the Difficulties I have been under in reinstating my self in my former Authority. However, that he designed to serve me effectual∣ly, will appear by the ensuing Discourse, which he intended to publish the Day after my Depar∣ture; where in his ludicrous Way he has pursued the Directions I left him, as he takes Notice himself in his Introduction. I was unwilling the World should be deprived of one Line of his Writing, and consequently could not well omit what the Excess of his Affection prompted him to say in my Favour, and which is perhaps the only Instance that can be given of his Partia∣lity.</P>
<P>My very good Friend <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff,</HI> being indispensably obliged to visit some Relations in the Country these Holy-Days: That there may be no Interruption of Justice in his Absence, has deputed me to officiate for him till his Return; and his last Instructions were, to have a particu∣lar Regard to the Interest of the Fair Sex, of which he has all along shewn himself a profess'd and constant Admirer. I am sensible how un∣equal my Talents are for so important a Task, nor are our different Sentiments upon that Sub∣ject a less Obstruction to the Performance of what he has enjoin'd me, than my Want of Abi∣lities to fill the Place of so worthy and great a Person. But to proceed to the Business in Hand.</P>
<Q><P>If we were to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake Mankind's Character from one another, there never could have been so seasonable a Time to exercise the Office of Censor with the utmost Severity; because there never was a Time, by universal Consent, when the Iniquities of the Age were so full blown, and consequently the World stood so much in Need of Correction. It has ever been thought natural to People advanced in Years, as I am,
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
to declaim upon the Vices of the Age they live in; but I am far from believing we are half so wicked as we say we are; and being a pretty strict Enquirer into Humane Nature, and endea∣vouring to trace all Things up to their original Causes, I am fully perswaded, that a malignant Love of Detraction is the reigning Vice of our Times; and could we but eradicate the perni∣cious Practice of Railing and Defamation, we should appear to be much upon the Level with our Predecessors, and not worse than the Na∣tions round about us. <HI>Zeno,</HI> the Founder of the Stoick Philosophy, had so little Indulgence for the Frailties and Infirmities of Mankind, that he esteemed the minutest Deviation from the Rules of Reason and Justice, to be of equal Weight with the most horrid Crimes, and gros∣sest Impieties; so stealing an Apple, by his Ac∣count, was as great a Sin as committing Sacri∣lege; and the throwing at Cocks on <HI>Shrove-Tuesday</HI> would have been reckoned as heinous an Offence, as murthering ones Father in cold Blood. We seem to pursue his Principles in the Judgments we make of other Peoples Actions. Every little Error, the most harmless Irregula∣rities, are subject to have Names of Infamy af∣fixed to them, and ranked among Deeds of the blackest Complexion.</P>
<P><HI>Jenny Filch</HI> is a lamentable Instance of this barbarous Custom. They have lately set upon her Reputation at my Lady <HI>Swaddles,</HI> the ge∣neral Rendezvous of reverend Female Elders, consisting of Antiquated Prudes, Superannuated Belles, and Coquets of Fifty Five. Her Lady∣ship stroaking the downy Honours of her Chin, with a hoarse masculine Voice, pronounced her guilty of Incontinency, cheating at Play, Theft, and drinking to Excess: What an Accumula∣tion of Enormities! How severe are these Re∣flections upon the Reputation of a young Lady?
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
And had she not a Greatness of Mind superior to their Malice, which some no doubt will a∣scribe to Impudence, I cannot see how she could dare shew her Face. But I who have known her from her Infancy, think it incumbent on me to vindicate her Character, and make no Question, in very few Words, of convincing all impartial Judges, how innocent she is of what they lay to her Charge. <HI>Jenny Filch</HI> was brought up at a Boarding-School, where Chil∣dren of both Sexes were promiscuously receiv'd. From a Girl she hated a Sedentary Life; so little Progress was made in the Sampler. Her Humour was brisk and jovial, her Constitution sanguine and vigorous, which led her to delight in robust Diversions; such as Trap-ball, Jug∣gle-cat, British-hoppers, Nine-pins, and Whip∣ping Tops. To share in their Sports, she was fain to be much among the Boys; she grew from thence to love their Company extreamly, and has gradually continued the Affection ever since. I am forced to explain this Matter very particularly, because she has been often twitted by the Ladies for liking to be with the Fellows rather than with them. As she is a very little Observer of Forms, she seldom could endure to be under the Restraint of a set Dress, but rather chuse, with some one Friend, to go in a Mob, and a Mask, into the Pit at a Play, than to sit in a Box. The Vivacity of her Wit, and the Smart∣ness of her Repartees, drew constantly all the young Beaux about her. This Humour of hers it seems took mightily; and she would often prevail upon those Ladies of her Acquain∣tance, whose Husbands were beyond Sea, pure∣ly out of Compassion, rather than to sit moping and melancholy at Home, to go along with her; and in short, did all she could to procure them such Diversions, as might make them less sen∣sible of their 'Spouse's Absence. When the Play
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
was near done, no Body was more nice in chu∣sing some of the most civil and harmless Men to lead them to a Coach; and because Hack∣ney-Coachmen are often very rude and impo∣sing, they would now and then for Protection permit them to step in, and perhaps drive to <HI>Phillips</HI>'s, just to refresh their Spirits. Some∣times, if they were very well assured of the Gentlemen's Behaviour, they would in a Fro∣lick venture to ear a Frigasee at <HI>Pontacks,</HI> but never failed to be back by Twelve. I remem∣ber there was a great Pother about Two or Three of her Companions, who at their Hus∣band's Return, were very near encreasing their Family. But how she is to blame all this while, no Body can say 'twas her doing; let every one answer for their own Follies: And this is all I ever heard alledged against her upon the first Article.</P>
<P>Now, as to cheating at Play, I suppose, what mislead them into that Opinion, was her great Skill and Dexterity in all Tricks at Cards: For having very fine Fingers, she took a great deal of Pleasure in learning whatever the famous <HI>High German</HI> could teach her in that Art, wherein she grew so great a Proficient, that in a short Time she out-did her Master. Twice or Thrice a Week (meerly for Amusement) she would pass the Evening at <HI>Langteral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>;</HI> and truly 'twas very entertaining for any Standers by to ob∣serve what a superior Genius she had in hand∣ling the Cards above the People she play'd with. She would make nothing of shewing Three Loo's in Five Deals, to the great Wonder and Surprize of all the Company. But as this was only done for Diversion, she chose to play so low, that she seldom carried off above Four or Five Pounds, just to pay her Chair, and buy clean Gloves; what they mean by Theft, I can't imagine, unless 'twas slipping now and then a

China Cup into her Pocket at an <HI>Indian House,</HI> to adorn her Cabinet. This, it seems, is a here∣ditary Piece of Furniture she is very fond of; it came from <HI>Italy</HI> long ago, the Inside is curious∣ly painted, wherein are represented the Loves of <HI>Endymion</HI> and the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, Cupid</HI> and <HI>Psyche, Ve∣nus</HI> and <HI>Adonis,</HI> with several other fabulous Stories. She ever loved to have Things neat a∣bout her, and only wanted some few Pieces of China to place upon the Top of this Cabinet, but being a notable Housewife, she could not endure to squander away her Money upon such Baubles; so when she went with any of her Ac∣quaintance to Shops that deal in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Things, she would pick up in one Place a Cup, in the next a Saucer, in a Third something of another Sort, either China or Japan, just as it came to Hand, and by Degrees got as compleat a Col∣lection together as any Body: In short, there ne∣ver was a more agreeable Variety, for no Two Pieces were alike in the whole Parcel. 'Tis ten to one some scrupulous People will be apt to call this Pilfering; but let them consider, no Body ever more exactly observed the Rules of Justice, in all the Measures she took, to supply her self with those Conveniencies. Every Shop contributed but barely its Share, and the Bur∣then being equally laid, (so far from giving Oc∣casion of Complaint) the Loss was scarce felt by any Body; besides, she made them ample A∣mends by commending their Goods, and bring∣ing them Custom. I may add in her Behalf, that what she did was meerly in Conformity of the Fashion: Every Lady's Cabinet was cover'd with China; she could not well afford to buy it, What should she do? It has been a receiv'd Saying, <HI>One had as good be out of the World, as out of the Fashion;</HI> from whence we may con∣clude, those Things are as necessary as Meat and Drink; and no Body was ever accounted a Cri∣minal
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
for taking as much as would suffice Na∣ture, let it be at whose Expence it would. In∣deed, had this been done in any b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e View, for filthy Lucre, and to sell again, I readily grant she were to blame; but in her Case 'tis no more than stealing the Custom of Wine for ones own Table, and we all know how commonly that's practised by People of very tender Con∣sciences.</P></Q>
<P>What remains to be spoken of, is, <HI>Her immode∣rate Love of Wine;</HI> nor will she be less clear in this, than in all the rest. <Q><HI>Jenny</HI> has a voluble Tongue, and loves to exercise it, that I cannot but own she often talks her self into a Heat, and that causes Thirst; sometimes by an Ab∣sence of Mind, pretty incident to her, she will call for Glass after Glass, without remembring, she drank but the Minute before. Now, this may prove she has a short Memory indeed; but how to infer the <HI>Love of Wine</HI> from hence, I cannot see. The Mistake however is easy to be accounted for. The Negligence of her Dress, her fluster'd Complexion, her great Loquacity sometimes, and her incoherent Answers to o∣thers, when her Thoughts are wandering, often concur to make her look as if she were actually in Drink: But is this an equitable Way of Judg∣ing? If once we suffer our selves to be imposed on by Appearances, farewel all Hopes of having Truth established among us in our Generation.</Q></P>
<P>Before I dismiss this Subject, I cannot but ex∣press a sincere Concern for a Multitude of injur'd Women who have suffered in their Characters, for want of a Champion to defend their Cause; and I will take upon me to affirm, as much might have been said for a Hundred about this Town who have been basely abused, as I have done for <HI>Jenny Filch.</HI> But I refer their Justification to my Friend <HI>Isaac,</HI> to whom that Province does most properly belong.</P>

<P>LEaning out of my Window this Morning, I observ'd a Young Gentleman pass under it, whose Face I was sure to have seen, but could not presently recollect his Name. The Oddness of his Figure help'd to disguise him; for, though otherwise decent enough, he had a Napkin-Cap on his Head; and at the same Time, by the Neg∣ligence of his Air, gave one to understand, that he thought himself dress'd for the whole Day. In this Manner he walk'd on to the End of our Lane, then turn'd short upon his Heel, and hurry'd back again with the utmost Precipitation. By this Time I had made a shift to remember, that this was the same Young Gentleman whom I formerly made Mention of, in order to recommend a Play of his to the World. There was Merit enough in that Performance to make me a Well-wisher to the Author, and as much Wit as might make him ca∣pable of an odd Turn in his Understanding.</P>
<P>I was sorry to see him thus expos'd, and bec∣kon'd him up to me; he came in great Confusion, and without giving me Time to ask any Que∣stions, told me, <HI>he was particularly asham'd to be seen by a Man of my Character, in so heedless a Way, that indeed he had come out in some hast, and forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his Hat and Perriwig.</HI> By his aukward Man∣ner of excusing himself, I soon found the Cause of his Disorder; that it was purely Artificial, and
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
lay rather in his Heart than his Head. 'Twas with great Indignation I heard his Apology, and had not I been strongly prejudic'd in the young Man's behalf, I should hardly have afforded him the Fa∣vour of a Rebuke. After some Enquiry, I found by him, that this Inadvertency had cost him much Pains and Industry to acquire, and that by long Use, it was now improv'd into a Habit.</P>
<P>He freely own'd, that this was a Method he had often took to distinguish and recommend himself as a Wit, and that he had hitherto met with good Success. I was a little pacify'd with the Frankness of this Confession, and encourag'd him to proceed in it.—<Q REND="inline">'To tell you the Truth, Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> I was led into this Error ve∣ry young, and the Occasion of it perhaps may give you Diversion. 'Twas a Custom at the Great School where I was bred, frequently to call over the Names of the Boys, in the Presence of the Master. This happen'd one Day, just af∣ter the Publick Prayers were over, and when it came to my Turn to say <HI>Adsum,</HI> through Mi∣stake I answer'd, <HI>Amen.</HI> Would you believe, Sir, that from this very Moment I came imme∣diately into Vogue? I was cry'd up for a Boy of great Parts, and of a wild, but extraordinary Ge∣nius. As I grew more careless, I was still more admir'd, and by a Thousand little premeditated Blunders. I at last establish'd a Reputation. When I came to the University, I expected to be laugh'd out of my Fooleries; but instead of that, I was every Day more confirm'd in them. There was hardly a Man of Distinction, but was, as they call it in the University Cant, a <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> and a <HI>Rattle.</HI> To be a very great Sloven in Dress, was some Degree of Merit, and I par∣ticularly remember one of the <HI>Beaux Esprits,</HI> that valued himself upon being the dirtiest Fel∣low that ever writ a good Line. 'Twas a Mat∣ter of Emulation amongst us, whose Rooms
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
should be worst furnish'd, and lie in the greatest Disorder, so that with a little wresting of the Sense, we might have writ over our Doors,<Q><L>— Hic vivimus ambitiosa</L>
<L>Paupertate. —</L></Q>
<HI>Harry Heedless,</HI> whose Works you may have heard of, has lately taken an Allegorical Inven∣tory of his Goods, in Heroic Verse; suffer me, Sir, to put it into your Hands, and to beg a Place for it in your next <HI>Lucubrations.</HI>"</Q> Here the young Gentleman took his Leave, and thank'd me for my Friendship, with an Air of Sincerity that could not be dissembled. His Readiness to understand his Error, and his Resolution to re∣form it, have indeed convinc'd me, that in Mat∣ters of this Kind, a Man of great Parts may re∣peat more in half an Hour, than one of ordinary Capacity can in many Years. But I must not omit the Verses.</P>

<L>Sublime and far Superior to the rest,</L>

<P><PB N="21" REF="24"/>
I cannot help adding a Word or Two upon this Humour of setting up for a Wit, by personating a different Conduct from others, in the Common Actions of Life. The rather, because within the Compass of my own Observation, it has depriv'd the World of many useful Persons, and eclips'd many valuable Qualifications. It has certainly been the Misfortune of several Great Men, to have had something singular in their Gate, their Diet, and even in their Conversation it self. They who have follow'd the profounder Studies, appear of∣ten to have their thoughts distracted, as 'tis par∣ticularly observ'd of Mathematicians, their Minds being so steddily fix'd, that they cannot easily un∣bend them.</P>
<P>Hence it is that others, imagining the Merit lies in the Singularity, are glad to find it so easie a Matter to distinguish themselves; the Desire of doing which I take to be the Root of all Affecta∣tion. To say Truth, the Men of Wit have, na∣turally, their Share in these Imperfections. For as more severe Studies require a very close Appli∣cation, theirs perhaps ingage it too little, and their Spirits are too volatile to give a long and constant Attention. This Absence of theirs, if I may so speak, my Cousin <HI>Humphry</HI> calls a Tax upon great Genius's, and says, he thinks it a Happiness, when a Man of eminent Parts has nothing Particular to be known by, ei∣ther when he walks the Street, or appears in Company. For which Reason, in talking over the Characters of Ingenious Men, I am frequently offended to hear People dwell upon some odd Circumstances in their Behaviour. A certain Au∣thor about Town is much celebrated for writing all his Works upon Backs of Letters, and Scraps of Paper. Another writ the best Part of his Poem upon old Cards, and had like to have lost Ten of the finest Lines in it, upon an Ace of Dia∣monds, which he had unluckily misplac'd. A
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
Third, of Immortal Memory, was wont to lie in his Perriwig, and caught a Cold that destroy'd him, by washing his Hands. These and many other Singularities observable in Men of extraor∣dinary Talents, might, for ought one knows, be natural to them. But when <HI>Papilio</HI> studies for In∣coherent Answers to every Question that is ask'd him, and makes Appointments on purpose to for∣get them; 'tis a Question amongst the Curious, Whether the Humour be natural or affected? I think it the most favourable Opinion, that there is a Mixture of both. I have often with great Pleasure considered the Character of my Friend <HI>Urbanus,</HI> whose great Wit and Learning are in∣deed accompanied with Singularities, such as are altogether Natural, but will, I doubt, meet with few Imitators: I mean his excessive Candor, Mo∣desty and good Nature. The Affectation of these Qualities would sufficiently distinguish any one that would be at the Pains to transcribe them, and the Consequences of it would be of Service to the World. But to copy the Infirmities only of Great Men, and to quote their Example in our Defence, is making Precedents of them, where they least desire to be so, and perverting their Authority to give a Sanction to Folly.</P>

<P>AMongst other Severities I have met with from some Criticks, the cruelest for an Old Man is, that they will not let me be at quiet in my Bed, but pursue me to my very Dreams. I
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
must not dream but when they please, nor upon long continued Subjects, however Visionary in their own Natures; because there is a manifest Moral quite thro' them, which to produce as a Dream is improbable and unnatural. The Pain I might have had from this Objection, is prevented by considering they have missed another, against which I should have been at a Loss to defend my self. They should have ask'd me whether the Dreams I publish can properly be call'd <HI>Lucubra∣tions,</HI> which is the Name I have given to all my Papers, whether in Volumes or Half-sheets: So manifest a Contradiction <HI>in Terminis,</HI> that I won∣der no Sophister ever thought of it: But the o∣ther is a Cavil. I remember when I was a Boy at School, I have often dream'd out the whole Passages of a Day; that I rode a Journey, bai∣ted, supp'd, went to Bed, and rose the next Morning; and I have known young Ladies who would dream a whole Contexture of Adventures in one Night large enough to make a Novel. In Youth the Imagination is strong, not mix'd with Cares, nor tinged with those Passions that most disturb and confound it, such as Avarice, Ambi∣tion, and many others. Now as old Men are said to grow Children again, so in this Article of Dreaming, I am returned to my Childhood. My Imagination is at full Ease, without Care, Ava∣rice, or Ambition to clog it, by which, among ma∣ny others, I have this Advantage of doubling the small Remainder of my Time, and living Four and Twenty Hours in the Day. However, the Dream I am now going to relate, is as wild as can well be imagined, and to please these Re∣finers upon Sleep, without any Moral that I can discover.<Q>It happen'd that my Maid left on the Table in my Bed-Chamber, one of her Story-Books (as she calls them) which I took up, and found full of strange Impertinences, fitted to her Tast and
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
Condition; of Poor Servants that came to be Ladies, and Serving-Men of low Degree, who married Kings Daughters. Among other Things I met this Sage Observation, that a Lion would never hurt a true Virgin: With this Medly of Nonsense in my Fancy I went to Bed, and dream'd that a Friend waked me in the Mor∣ning, and proposed for Pastime to spend a few Hours in seeing the Parish-Lions, which he had not done since he came to Town; and because they show'd but once a Week, he would not miss the Opportunity. I said I would humour him; tho', to speak the Truth, I was not fond of those cruel Spectacles, and if it were not so ancient a Custom, founded, as I had heard, upon the wisest Maxims, I should be apt to cen∣sure the Inhumanity of those who introduced it. All this will be a Riddle to the waking Reader, till I discover the Scene my Imagination had formed upon the Maxim, that a Lion would ne∣ver hurt a true Virgin. I dream'd, that by a Law of Immemorial Time a He-Lion was kept in every Parish at the common Charge, and in a Place provided, adjoining to the Church-yard; That, before any one of the Fair Sex was married, if she affirmed her self to be a Virgin, she must on her Wed∣ding-Day, and in her Wedding-Cloaths, per∣form the Ceremony of going alone into the Den, and stay an Hour with the Lion let loose, and kept fasting Four and Twenty Hours on purpose. At a proper Height, above the Den, were convenient Galleries for the Relations and Friends of the Young Couple, and open to all Spectators. No Maiden was forced to offer her self to the Lion; but if she refused, it was a Disgrace to marry her, and every one might have Liberty of calling her a Whore. And me∣thought it was as usual a Diversion to see the Parish-Lions, as with us to go to a Play or an
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
Opera. And it was reckoned convenient to be near the Church, either for marrying the Vir∣gin if she escaped the Trial, or for burying the Bones when the Lion had devoured the rest, as he constantly did.</Q></P>
<P>To go on therefore with the Dream: <Q>We call'd first (as I remember) to see St. <HI>Dunstan</HI>'s Lion, but we were told they did not shew to Day: From thence we went to that of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> which, to my great Surprize, we found as lean as a Skeleton, when I expected quite the contrary; but the Keeper said 'twas no Wonder at all, because the poor Beast had not got an Ounce of Woman's Flesh since he came into the Parish. This amaz'd me more than the other, and I was forming to my self a mighty Vene∣ration for the Ladies in that Quarter of the Town, when the Keeper went on, and said, He wonder'd the Parish would be at the Charge of maintaining a Lion for nothing. Friend, (said I) do you call it Nothing, to justify the Virtue of so many Ladies, or has your Lion lost his distinguishing Faculty? Can there be any Thing more for the Honour of your Parish, than that all the Ladies married in your Church were pure Virgins? That is true, (said he) and the Doctor knows it to his Sorrow, for there has not been a Couple married in our Church since his Worship has been amongst us. The Virgins hereabouts are too wise to venture the Claws of the Lion; and because no Body will marry them, have all entered into Vows of Vir∣ginity. So that in Proportion we have much the largest Nunnery in the whole Town. This Manner of Ladies entring into a Vow of Vir∣ginity, because they were not Virgins, I easily conceiv'd, and my Dream told me, that the whole Kingdom was full of Nunneries, plenti∣fully stock'd from the same Reason.
<P><PB N="26" REF="29"/>
We went to see another Lion, where we found much Company met in the Gallery, the Keeper told us, we should see Sport enough, as he call'd it; and in a little Time, we saw a young beautiful Lady put into the Den, who walk'd up towards the Lion with all imaginable Security in her Countenance, and look'd smi∣ling upon her Lover and Friends in the Gallery; which I thought nothing extraordinary, because it was never known that any Lion had been mistaken. But however, we were all Disap∣pointed, for the Lion lifted up his Right Paw, which was the fatal Sign, and advancing for∣ward, seized her by the Arm, and began to tear it: The poor Lady gave a terrible shriek, and cry'd out, <HI>The Lion is just, I am no true Virgin,</HI> Oh! <HI>Sappho, Sappho.</HI> She could say no more, for the Lion gave her the <HI>Coup de Grace,</HI> by a squeeze in the Throat, and she expir'd at his Feet. The Keeper dragg'd away her Body to feed the Animal when the Company was gone, for the Parish Lions never used to eat in Pub∣lick. After a little Pause, another Lady came on towards the Lion in the same Manner as the former; we observ'd the Beast smell her with great Diligence, he scratch'd both her Hands with lifting them to his Nose, and clapping a Claw on her Bosom, drew Blood; however he let her go, and at the same Time turned from her with a So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Contempt, at which she was not a little mortify'd, and retired with some Confusion to her Friends in the Gallery. Me∣thought the whole Company immediately un∣derstood the Meaning of this, that the Easiness of the Lady had suffered her to admit certain impudent and dangerous Familiarities, border∣ing too much upon what is Criminal; neither was it sure whether the Lover then present had not some Sharers with him in those Free∣doms,
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
of which a Lady can never be too spa∣ring.</P>
<P>This happened to be an extraordinary Day, for a Third Lady came into the Den, laughing loud, playing with her Fan, tossing her Head, and smiling round on the young Fellows in the Gallery. However, the Lion leap'd on her with great Fury, and we gave her for gone; but on a sudden he let go his Hold, turned from her as if he were nauseated, then gave her a Lash with his Tail; after which she returned to the Gal∣lery, not the least out of Countenance: And this, it seems, was the usual Treatment of Co∣quets.</P>
<P>I thought we had now seen enough, but my Friend would needs have us go and visit One or Two Lions in the City. We call'd at Two or Three Dens where they happen'd not to shew, but we generally found half a Score young Girls, between Eight and Eleven Years Old, playing with each Lion, sitting on his Back, and putting their Heads into his Mouth; some of them would now and then get a Scratch; but we always discover'd, upon examining, that they had been hoydening with the young Ap∣prentices. One of them was calling to a pretty Girl of about Twelve Years, that stood by us in the Gallery, to come down to the Lion, and upon her Refusal, said, <HI>Ah, Miss</HI> Betty, <HI>we could never get you to come near the Lion, since you play'd at Hoop and Hide with my Brother in the Garret.</HI> We followed a Couple, with the Wedding Folks, goint to the Church of St. <HI>Ma∣ry-Ax</HI>'s. The Lady, though well stricken in Years, extremely crooked and deform'd, was dress'd out beyond the Gaiety of Fifteen; ha∣ving jumbled together, as I imagin'd, all the Tawd'ry Remains of Aunts, Godmothers, and Grandmothers, for some Generations past:
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
One of the Neighbours whisper'd me that she was an Old Maid, and had the clearest Repu∣tation of any in the Parish. There is nothing strange in that, thought I, but was much sur∣pris'd when I observ'd afterwards that she went towards the Lion with Distrust and Concern. The Beast was lying down, but upon Sight of her, snuff'd up his Nose Two or Three Times, and then giving the Sign of Death, proceeded instantly to Execution. In the midst of her A∣gonies, she was heard to name the Words, <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Artifices,</HI> with the utmost Horror, and several repeated Execrations: And at last concluded, <HI>Feel that I was, to put so much Con∣fidence in the Toughness of my Skin!</HI></P>
<P>The Keeper immediately set all in order a∣gain for another Customer, which happened to be a famous Prude, whom her Parents after long Threatnings, and much Perswasion, had with the extreamest Difficulty prevailed on to accept a young handsome Goldsmith, that might have pretended to five Times her Fortune. The Fathers and Mothers in the Neighbourhood used to quote her for an Ex∣ample to their Daughters. Her Elbows were rivetted to her Sides, and her whole Person so order'd as to inform every Body that she was afraid they should touch her. She only drea∣ded to approach the Lion, because it was a He one, and abhorr'd to think an Animal of that Sex should presume to breathe on her. The Sight of a Man at Twenty Yards Distance made her draw back her Head. She always sate upon the far∣ther Corner of the Chair, tho' there were Six Chairs between her and her Lover, and with the Door wide open, and her little Sister in the Room. She was never saluted but at the Tip of her Ear, and her Father had much ado to make her dine without her Gloves when there
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
was a Man at Table. She enter'd the Den with some Fear, which we took to proceed from the Height of her Modesty, offended at the Sight of so many Men in the Gallery. The Lion beholding her at a Distance, immediately gave the deadly Sign; at which the poor Crea∣ture (methinks I see her still) miscarried in a Fright before us all. The Lion seem'd to be surpris'd as much as we, and gave her Time to make her Confession, <HI>That she was Four Months gone, by the Fore-man of her Father's Shop, that this was her Third big Belly;</HI> and when her Friends ask'd, why she would venture the Trial? She said, <HI>her Nurse assured her, that a Lion would never hurt a Woman with Child.</HI>" Upon this I immediately wak'd, and could not help wishing, that the Deputy-Censors of my late Institution were indu'd with the same In∣stinct as these Parish Lions were.</P></Q></P>

Yet for all this, I do not find that I have any Degree of Interest in their Persons, or any Restraint upon their Con∣duct. Not a Furbelow has been sunk, nor a Yard of Whalebone parted with, to oblige me. Even my most gentle Corrections and Penny-Post Inti∣mations, have met with Neglect, Scorn and De∣fiance. <HI>Bellaria</HI> is a provoking Instance of this Kind; it has in good Earnest stood me in Three-Pence to reform her, and I do not find that she is One Farthing the better for it. She is young, 'tis true, and may live to be wiser: As her Beau∣ty goes off, Prudence perhaps will grow upon her; but to be discreet in the Height of her Charms, would be a much greater Merit. She knows the Faults I have charged her with, and must thank her self if she should hereafter
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
oblige me to be more open and particular. <HI>Sempro∣nia,</HI> with the same Aggravation, continues to be haughty, insolent, and unnatural. She is the Mo∣ther of Five beautiful Children, the eldest not above Seven Years Old, whom she never speaks to, but with a Design to teize them, and uses worse than any Animals that belong to her. Go∣ing to her Coach the other Day, she observ'd Two or Three of them diverting themselves in the Hall, and turning to her People, asked the Rea∣son why those Brats lay litt'ring about the House. Miss <HI>Molly</HI> was severely whip'd within this Week, for calling her Mother behind her back; and Ma∣ster <HI>Neddy</HI> taken from Table, for seeming only to want his Dinner before the <HI>Italian</HI> Greyhound had been fed.</P>
<P>I have met with a Case yet more extraordinary, and which has given me much Uneasiness; Tho' I cannot say of so Criminal a Nature as the latter. Taking a Turn in the <HI>Park</HI> about a Month since, I saw a Paper lie upon the Ground, which I had the Curiosity to stoop for, and found to be a <HI>Re∣cipe.</HI></P>

<P>I was very much surpris'd at so odd a Prescrip∣tion, and having formerly had the Honour to know the Lady for whose Use it was intended, cou'd not help inquiring into the Occasion of it:
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
With some Difficulty I inform'd my self, that <HI>Clo¦rinda,</HI> whom all the World admir'd, was very lately displeas'd with her own Person. Some good natur'd Friend, it seems, had put it in her Head that she was growing too fat, and in a little Time wou'd be out of all Shape. This sufficiently a∣larm'd her, and from a Gaiety of Temper, that was peculiar to her, she fell into Spleen, Vapours, and a Thousand imaginary Disquiets. There was no Absurdity so gross that her Fears did not im∣pose upon her. As she pass'd the Streets in her Chair, she expected every Moment that the Fel∣lows wou'd sink under their Burden, and wou'd often say to her self, <HI>Bless me, how the poor Crea∣tures blow!</HI> My Lady <HI>Kill-Chairman</HI>'s Shape was become the Object of her Envy, as it had former∣ly been the Subject of her Ridicule. In short, a Consultation of the most eminent Physicians was resolv'd on, and a Course of Acids, <HI>Cum Regimi∣ne,</HI> was, it seems, the Result of it. As soon as this came to my Knowledge, I sent <HI>Clorinda</HI> a Letter, full of such pressing Remonstrances, as the Occasion suggested to me. I conjur'd her with all the Tenderness of a Gallant, not to suffer so much Beauty to be lost to the World, by being over-curious to preserve it; nor that Bloom to wi∣ther thro' an irreligious Mortification of her self.</P>
<P>After taking so much Pains, to see my Advice neglected, and other Measures pursu'd, has, I own, sensibly touch'd me, both as an old Man, and a graduate Physician. However, it is yet in the Power of <HI>Clorinda</HI> to retrieve what is pass'd: She has nothing more to do than to eat, drink, and sleep, to make her self again the Joy of her Friends, the Desire of Mankind; and what is yet greater, (without Vanity be it said) to be heartily forgiven by the Censor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>

<P>'TIS a common Mistake, tho' of very ill Consequence, that many Failings and In∣firmities are too closely woven into our Constitu∣tions ever to be removed by any Pains or Appli∣cation of our own. Had I suffer'd my self to be∣lieve this, I had been now one of the peevishest old Fellows, as I was formerly one of the most passionate Youths, in the World. Till the Age of Sixteen I was never in good Humour two Hours together. I thought my self affronted by every one I met, and grew into a Proverb for the Violence of my Resentments. I no sooner came to the Use of my Reason, but I began to cool a∣pace, and have ever since preserved such an Even∣ness of Temper as is not easily ruffled, and which, under the greatest Difficulties and Distresses, has made me superior to them all.</P>
<P>I remember one Thing of my self in the Days of my Minority that was pleasant enough: When∣ever any Body had done me an ill Office, I used, in the Bitterness of my Heart, to wish my self Parson of the Parish for their Sake. He, I ob∣served, had once a Week the Privilege of speak∣ing
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
his Mind in publick, and of telling his Pa∣rishioners their own. This, I thought, was a mighty Relief to his Spleen, and indeed the Doctor made Use of it as if he had been of the same Opinion. He had a particular Felicity in finding out Texts to his Purpose, and no one Of∣fence could be committed against him, that did not appear the next <HI>Sunday</HI> to be literally forbid∣den in Scripture. The Top Gentleman in the Parish having one Day made him a Visit in a striped Night-Gown, he looked upon this <HI>Disha∣bilee</HI> as a Mark of Contempt; and the very next Time the Pulpit was his own, giving a Side-Glance towards the 'Squire's Pew, he pronounced with a loud Voice, <HI>Stripes are for the Backs of Fools,</HI> &amp;c. A poor Taylor had cabbaged some black Cloth that was put into his Hands, and the Text chosen for his Reprimand was, <HI>Hell and De∣struction are before them;</HI> though towards the End of the Discourse it was allowed, that <HI>a Rem∣nant should be saved.</HI></P>
<P>This petulant Humour of prostituting a pub∣lick Capacity to particular Resentments, is what I have industriously avoided throughout the whole Course of my Lucubrations. After the many Observations I have made upon humane Nature, it is, I confess, some Pleasure to com∣municate them to the Publick in the Manner I have chose to do it: But, unless in Cases where my Reputation has been openly attacked, I have never once interested the World in any Disputes relating to my self. Every Body knows what Provocations Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> gave me, and in how crowded a Theatre, before I would descend to take any Notice of him. When I did, it was in such a Manner, I thought, as all Controversy ought to be managed between Scholars and Gen∣tlemen. Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> obliged me to draw my Pen against them by a Piece of Ingra∣titude
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
that is hardly to be matched in History. I had always treated those Persons with a Respect due to their Characters, and as our Interests were mutual, I flattered my self that our Affections were so too. I know I shall suffer in the Opinion of some unforgiving People, when I make it known, that after such repeated Indignities I have again taken them into Favour. But as the following Petition was introduced to me by some of the first Quality in this Kingdom, I can deny nothing to their Commands, nor indeed to the Dictates of my own Humanity.</P>

<P>It was an infinite Pleasure to me the Day after I had reinstated the Petitioners, to see the Faces of my old Officers about me.

<P>THat Activity or Restlesness of Thought, that Desire of doing something, which is natural to almost every Body, does, when rightly appli∣ed, give Birth to many great and noble Enter∣prizes; but when it falls under the Direction of a fantastical Judgment, it becomes troublesome and ridiculous to all the World. On one Side, it con∣tributes to the Characters of the greatest Gene∣rals, and the wisest Statesmen; and on the other, it furnishes publick Conversations with Busy Bo∣dies and Buffoons. I have observed <HI>Will Worth∣less</HI> for a long Time about this Town labouring under a prodigious Impatience of being distin∣guish'd as a Man of some Sort of Figure or other. At his first coming from the University, he set up for a great Unbeliever; for which Reason, as likewise because he was afraid to be in a Room by himself, he spent most of his Time at the <HI>Graecian.</HI> But not arriving to any great Eminence in Infidelity, he turned himself with great Appli∣cation to the Calling of a Virtuoso. To equip himself for this, he travel'd twice into <HI>Italy,</HI> from
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
whence, at great Expence, he brought back a so∣lemn Face, with the Reputation of knowing as much as he did when he went out. Being now greatly accomplish'd for the Service of his Coun∣try, he thought it was high Time to take Care of the Constitution; and to that End, without Fear or Wit, leap'd at once over Head and Ears into publick Business. From that Time to this he has liv'd in a profess'd Course of Gravity. I have had more frequent Opportunities of conversing with him than I could have wish'd. For taking me by my Age to be a Man for his Purpose, he has in a Manner forced himself upon my Acquaintance. He has told me with great Frankness, That he thinks it below a reasonable Man either to laugh or drink Wine, and that he has laid down some Rules to himself as essential to the Character he affects: <Q REND="inline">"To preserve a stedfast Countenance, to whisper in Coffee-houses, to shave but twice a Week, and to wear but one Loop to his Hat; to read nothing but the Votes, and to keep Company with his Father. He has sometimes said with as much Pleasure as his Face is capa∣ble of, Well, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> nothing sure is so solid a Satisfaction as Business—For my Part, I love it so well, that I can't like a Proposal the worse for having been rejected;"</Q> and to do him Justice, he has been a true Friend to di∣stressed Projects, and as good as a Father to Bills in Disgrace. He receives more Petitions than a First Minister, and solicits the Affairs of all the mad Beggars about Town. <HI>Monday</HI> last I was obliged upon some Business to go to his Levee. I found with him, over Bohea and Bread and But∣ter, Justice <HI>Upperside</HI> and Sir <HI>Paul Marmalade.</HI> Upon my coming in, Mr. <HI>Worthless,</HI> who sate next the Fire, rose up and forced me into his Chair. The Justice, with an innocent Smile in his Face, and his Cane at his Mouth, said, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. <HI>Bicker∣staff,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
you can tell us; Pray, Sir, what are all these Insurances upon Births and Marriages, will they come to any Thing or no? Before I could answer, he went on, Why really, Sir, I would be glad Gentlemen would consider, eve∣ry Nation consists chiefly of Men and Women. How! says Sir <HI>Paul,</HI> do you make nothing of Children?"</Q> The Justice, shaking his Head, said, <Q REND="inline">"My good Friend Sir <HI>Paul,</HI> you don't take me; but what I would offer, is this, If Mar∣riages are hindered, Procreation in a legal Way will cease, and the Consequence of that every one knows. However, if no Body else takes Notice of it, I am sure I shan't—'Tis not my Business to find Faults'—</Q>Mr. <HI>Worthless</HI> stopping him short, cried, <Q REND="inline">"Pray take me along with you; for unless the Persons marrying be equal to the Persons married, where is your Ballance? For I take it, a Nation may be over as well as under married."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well, says Sir <HI>Paul,</HI> I don't love disputing in Company, but you would have a hard Matter to make that out."</Q> This weighty Conversation was interrupted by Captain <HI>Mystery,</HI> who came in from his Round of Levees, with a Face of great Hurry and Impor∣tance: <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, says he, you little think where I have been this Morning—Hark you Mr. <HI>Worthless,</HI> a Word in your Ear. All out—Ships—Command—A Blockhead and a Coward, and all their Hands to it—'Tis a little hard tho' that neither Side should take any Notice of one'—</Q></P>
<P>This was all I overheard of his Whisper, when a Servant came and told Mr. <HI>Worthless,</HI> there were several People at the Door who desired to speak with his Honour. Leave of Audience be∣ing given, the first that entered was Don <HI>Cava∣liero de Tristo Figure.</HI> The Solemnity of his Air, joined with the miserable Habit he was in, was a
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
most exquisite Burlesque upon the Humour of his Country. He had in his Hand a Bundle of Pa∣pers, much obscured with Filth, and of a Fra∣grancy not to be endured. These he presented to the Patriot, who gave me to understand, that they contained a short and easy Expedient to settle the House of <HI>Austria</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Spain,</HI> whispering at the same Time, that he ve∣rily believed this Gentleman to be of the Blood Royal.</P>
<P>The next, as I understood from him, was one Mrs. <HI>James,</HI> a little ancient Gentlewoman, in a Pair of very high Pattins, who, with much Anxiety and Hunger in her Countenance, desired his Honour, with a low Voice, and in a Language that I hardly understood, <Q REND="inline">"To attend her Busi∣ness in the House, for that it was now just rea∣dy to come on;"</Q> and it seems it has been in the same Forwardness for these Thirty Years past. She withdrew with great Humility, and repeat∣ed Courtesies, to make Room for a Third. Mr. <HI>Worthless</HI> took me aside, and told me, <Q REND="inline">"That this was a Gentleman who in his younger Days studied the Law; but having failed in that, had now put himself into the fantastical Habit I saw, and under it was one of the deepest Heads in the World. He has attended me, says he, these Three Years, with a Project to save <HI>England,</HI> and I know not yet whether I shall bring it to bear."</Q> I was by this Time heartily tired, and in proper Form took Leave of the Company, not knowing whether I ought most to commiserate the Misfortunes of these poor Wretches, or contemn and expose the Fol∣lies of their Patron.</P>

I was so pleased with the Style and Orthography of it, that I could not but wonder at the Carelesness of the Person who, as I sup∣posed, after writing an Answer, had left so va∣luable a Piece behind him; and knowing no readier Way to put it into his Hands again, re∣solved to make it publick by the first Opportu∣nity.</P>

<P>THough I happen to be descended from a Melancholy Father, and a Hypochondrix Mother, I was not till my Fortieth Year made sensible that Infirmities of this Kind are commu∣nicated from Parents to their Children. 'Twas about that Time that the College Clock run∣ning mightily in my Head, I could not help fancying my self to be so nearly related to it, that I was obliged not to speak but when that strook. My Cousin, the Clock happening soon after to be down with a Disorder, I heard no∣thing of him for a Week together, during which Time I could not be prevailed upon to speak one Syllable; and it being my Turn to read a publick Lecture, I was forced to send my Ex∣cuse in Writing.</P>
<P>This Fit going off, I was my self for Half a Year afterwards; but sitting much by the Com∣mon-Room Fire, I had a strange Fancy that I was a Poker, and if any Body talked of filling a Pipe, I immediately moved off for fear they should make Use of me to light it. Upon the least Indisposition, I had no Notion of going to any Body but the Smith to be mended. After this, I took my self for the College Gate, and lay under a constant Apprehension of being se∣verely thumped at all Hours of the Night.
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
Would you think it, Sir? At last this Whim went so far, that I verily believed my self to be your Paper, the <HI>Tatler,</HI> Then, though I had sometimes the Pleasure of thinking that I was mightily commended, at others I had inexpres∣sible Fears. I fancied, that a Friend of mine who had taken Physick, was looking for me high and low on a very unworthy Occasion, and was wonderfully delighted when my Bro∣ther, the <HI>Gazette,</HI> was made Use of in my Stead. I was often vexed at my Heart to be hung al∣most all over with Advertisements of Insuran∣ces, Morning-Gowns, Lap-Dogs, and Lottery Tickets, and now and then had terrible Unea∣siness for having made bold with my Betters. Being at length pretty well recovered of this Fit, I thought it advisable to come to <HI>London</HI> and take Care of my Health: But as I was go∣ing to the Coach, to my great Surprize, I found my self turned into a Foot-ball, and at the Mercy of a Pack of Scoundrels, who, without any Re∣gard to the Dignity of my former Characters, kicked me from one End of the <HI>High-street</HI> to the other. During this last Misfortune, I have been made the unwilling Instrument of break∣ing many Windows, and once of flying in the Face of a Civil Magistrate. For this Reason I am, as you may very well imagine, ashamed to shew my Head; and being from my Spherical Figure incapable of Writing my self, I have begged a Friend to consult you in my Name up∣on this my deplorable Condition, and to tell you, that I hope in some Time I shall be able to assure you of my being my own Man, and</P>

<P>ONE or two of my last Papers having made it known that I am removed from by old Lodgings in <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> I have on that Occasion received Letters from two Correspon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents of very different Sentiments. One of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem wishes me Joy of a clearer Air, and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leasing Situation; the other is so free as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all me a restless, unquiet old Fellow, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain Pretender to Philosophy.

If the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entleman who is so severe upon me would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o me the Favour of a Visit, he would be con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nced that I have changed for the better. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave from hence a Prospect filled with such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ariety of Entertainments, that I am almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>mpted in my old Age to turn Poet for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ke of it. As a Lover of my Country, it is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nsible Pleasure to me, from the Nobleness of

the River, and Magnificence of the Structures, to measure the Wealth and Grandeur of the <HI>British</HI> Nation. In the Capacity of Censor, I consider this huge Mass of Buildings as my own Province, and am in a Manner directed by my Eye to the Execution of my Office, as I appre∣hend this or that Part of the Metropolis to stand in Need of Correction. But these, alas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> were not the principal Inducements that brought me hither. Old Age, and an unhealthy Win∣ter, have taken from me most of my Friends in the other Part of the Town, whom Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a long Acquaintance had rivetted into my E∣steem, and made almost necessary to my Way of Living.</P>
<P>They were not Men indeed whom I ever ad∣mired for a ready Turn of Wit, or the Vivari∣ty of their Conversation, which, to say Truck are but the Embellishments of a good Under∣standing, and serve rather to divert and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than to indear us to one another. It is for this Reason, that, in the large Commerce I have had with Mankind, it has been my Way to prefer Men of steady Judgment, even Tem∣pers, cool and indolent Complexions, to those of excessive Smartness, Humour, and Repar¦tee; there being something in the constant So¦ciety of the latter, that loosens and unhing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the Mind from the more serious Offices of Life, and at the same Time keeps it upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stretch in idle and unprofitable Pursuits. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trusty,</HI> on this as well as many other Accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> has ever preserved the first Place in my Af¦fections.

first he introduced to me is a Clergyman of a∣bout Sixty, who, it seems, has passed Thirty Years of his Life on a moderate Preferment in the Country, without ever solliciting or desiring a Removal. His Children are grown up, and by his good Management provided for. He has been for some Time a Widower, and being very much worn with the constant Duties of his Function, was with Difficulty prevailed on to leave a Curate on his Benefice, and come up to Town, where his eldest Daughter is settled, and with whom he now lives. My Friend tells me, That he was never known to have a Law Suit or Difference with any of his Parishioners; That he was ever making up Quarrels, and doing good. Offices in the Neighbourhood; That he had been often left sole Guardian to Orphans, and discharged his Trust with the utmost Fidelity; That he constantly visited the Sick, and ha∣ving some Knowledge in Physick, and the Composition of Medicines, had assigned Part of his Income to that Use. When he came first to the Place, there was a Conventicle hard by, which had drawn away most of the Peo∣ple from the Church; but by the Exemplari∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of his Life, his great Hospitality for so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lender a Fortune, and the Gentleness of his Nature, joined with the Force of his Perswa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, the People returned by Degrees, the Dissenting Minister went off, and the Barn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey met in was applied to its proper Use.</P>
<P>I was pleased with the Figure of the Man as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e came into my Room, somewhat tall, incli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to be lean, his Hair grey, of a fair but flo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d Complexion, with a certain Sweetness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>mplicity in his Countenance.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55"/>
In our Conversation he seemed to shew that Sort of Diffidence which usually attends Men of the best Sense, after having passed their Lives in Retirement. Upon all Occasions he sub∣mitted with great Deference to me, as one who had studied Humane Nature, and atta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣ed to a perfect Knowledge of the World. Af∣ter an Hour's Talk, having industriously led him through several Subjects, I found him to be of an excellent Understanding, cultiva∣ted by the Knowledge of the best Author of Antiquity, and of a perfect good Taste to point out their Beauties. Amongst the rest, he shewed me many Instances of the Sublime in the Holy Writings, which I had not heard any one before observe; so that upon the Whole, all the Difference I could find be∣tween us both in Point of knowing the World, was, that he had been chiefly conver∣sant with the best Part of it, and I with the worst.</P>
<P>This Day Sevennight in the Morning Mr. <HI>Trusty</HI> presented me another new Acquain∣tance: <Q REND="inline">"Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> says he, this is Dr. — I know you will be pleased with one another."</Q> Having never heard the Name before, I concluded him not very emi∣nent in his Profession. He had no Haste in his Countenance, and sate with me above two Hours without any visible Impatience to be going. He appeared to have Abundance of good Nature without the sneaking mercenary Affectation of it, and mentioned with Honour as many of his own Profession as are allowed to deserve it. He received no Message all the while we were together; and I observed par∣ticularly, that he discoursed often as if he be∣lieved Revealed Religion. We dined toge∣ther, and he carved up a Pullet without read∣ing
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
a Lecture of Anatomy upon it. He seem∣ed to be of a facetious Wit, and after a few Glasses of Wine would now and then let off a Quibble, without thinking it any Disparage∣ment to his Understanding. I took the first Opportunity to enquire of my Friend into the Character of this Gentleman, whose Account was, That he had many Years belonged to the Faculty, that he was an admirable Scholar, and very knowing in his Profession; but be∣ing born a Gentleman, and to a competent Fortune of his own, he disdained the servile Ways of making Court to Nurses and Apothe∣caries, and therefore his chief Practice lay a∣mong the Poor. He never valued his Reputa∣tion equal to the Life of a Patient, and often preserved the latter, though by transgressing a∣gainst Form and Method. He was once com∣ing into Business, but lost it by perswading his Patients they were not sick, and refusing their Fees.</P>
<P>The other Mr. <HI>Trusty</HI> has recommended to me, is a young Gentleman under Twenty, and a Nephew of his own. His Person is graceful, his Eyes quick and lively, the Tone of his Voice agreeable, his Look open, affable and serene, his Constitution vigorous and sanguine, his Air, Dress and Behaviour, easy, modest and unaffected. He has been bred under the Care and Direction of his Uncle, who, I remember, often used to say to me, <Q REND="inline">"I will undertake, <HI>Isaac,</HI> to make this Boy have as much useful Knowledge at Nineteen, as you or I have at Fifty."</Q> This he has effected beyond what I could possibly have conceived, and the Methods he has taken to do it, shall hereafter in one or more of these Papers be communicated to the Publick. In the mean Time, it is an infinite Delight to me to find this young Man fre∣quently
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
making such just Observations as are in others the Result of long Experience; to hear him reason closely without Prejudice, Passion or Conceit; at other Times to see him gay, chearful and entertaining, without run∣ning into indecent Liberty, or straining for the Character of a Wit; and upon all Occasions to observe in him a generous Detestation of every Thing that is base and unworthy, an Integrity founded on good Sense, and superior to every Temptation. What inexpressible Pleasure must arise from the Reflection of having furnished the World with so extraordinary a Person? who, if his Merit does not hinder him, may, for half a Century, in the highest Stations, and most honourable Employments, be of publick Im∣portance to the World.</P>

<P>SItting last Night over a chearful Fire, and a Glass of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, with my Friend <HI>Sa∣muel Trusty,</HI> I happened to say, with a Free∣dom peculiar to our Manner of Conversing, that I could not but admire our mutual Con∣stancy in the Friendship that had so long been between us. <Q REND="inline">"Why, 'tis right, <HI>Isaac,</HI> says he, and I hope we may look upon it as an Argu∣ment of Virtue on both Sides. For my own Part, I do not remember that I ever wished my self from you when our Affairs would give us Leave to be together."</Q> But this A∣greement, says I, is so far from being com∣mon in the World, that if the Institution at <HI>Dunmowe</HI> were in Favour of Friendship, as it is of Matrimony, I am confident there are few besides our selves would have any Right to the <HI>Pramium.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"No, (says he) and I remember a Story of two pretty remarkable Friends of our own Time that you remind me of on this Occasion. They had lived some time about Town, and being weary of mixed Company, Noise, and Impertinence, agreed to retire where they might without Interruption en∣joy one another. <HI>Nottingham</HI> was the Place resolved on; but they had not continued
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
there a Week in close and constant Conversa∣tion, before they grew insufferably sick of each other. Some Third Person must be en∣gaged into their Relief, and being acciden∣tally lodged in a House next the Gaol, where a Cup of good Liquor was to be had, they sent a Message to the Gaoler, to tell him, if he was at Leisure, there were two Gentlemen that were alone would come and smoak a Pipe with him. Being otherwise employed, he sent his Excuse. Upon which they went in Person, and asked him, If there was never an honest Highwayman in the House that would be glad of Company? He told them he was quite out at present, and that if it was to save their Lives, he had no Body but an old Woman that was under Sentence of Death for exercising the Black Art, and he was sure they would not take up with her. He happened to be mistaken, for they im∣mediately obtained Leave to go down into the Dungeon, and there solaced themselves with Ale, Brandy, and the Society of this poor unfortunate Creature, till within two Hours of her Execution.'</Q></P>
<P>What a Levity of Mind is this, that will not suffer us to acquiesce in the most reasonable Enjoyments of Life? What a Want of Princi∣ple, Reflection, and ordinary Resolution? As one every Day sees the wretched Effects of this viciated Taste in Conversation, Dress, and Be∣haviour; I for my own Part am made more particularly sensible of them in the Prosecution of this Work. To say as much as is proper on the same Subject, is wearing it out, as they call it; and a Half Sheet without Four or Five Breaks has a dull heavy Look, and is offensive to the Eyes of curious Readers; so that for

<P>I Think it not of much Consequence whe∣ther your <HI>Isaacship</HI> be real or assumed, much less whether the Papers you publish are your own, or chiefly raised by Contribu∣tion from able Hands. As to the first of these Objections, I confess for my own Part, that I am not the less diverted or instructed by a Fable for knowing that it is such, but have often found my self bettered and entertained by the imaginary Conversations of <HI>Chanti∣cleer</HI> and <HI>Reynard</HI> the Fox. For the other, if you are as little fond of Praise as a good and wise Man ought to be, you will content your self with being, in any Sort, the Instrument of doing a Service to Mankind, without ex∣pecting or desiring their Applause for it: Though perhaps it may hereafter reflect some Honour on your Name, that in an Age when Wit and Learning were at a great Height in this Kingdom, you were admitted to a De∣gree of Intimacy with the Top Genius's of it, and at the same Time had so much Regard to the Publick, as always to prefer their Wri∣tings to your own. To tell you the Truth, I am at present more sollicitous about the Existence of another Person than that of Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> and would enquire very seri∣ously of you, Whether there be really any

Rather than fail, I would stretch hard for the other Two; but I conjure you, Sir, not to make this Letter publick, which if you answer privately, and to my Satisfaction, by the Penny-Post, I will afterwards meet either your self, or wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> you shall depute, to talk further on this Af∣fair.

<P>I Am a Gentleman of the Broad Sword, and desire to be heard before your Honour touching a Point that nearly concerns mine, which is this: Being in Company this Even∣ing with a Youth of more than ordinary Fire, he observed my Nose to be somewhat larger than his; upon which he took a Dislike to my Face, and towards the End of the Night could not forbear telling me, that he thought it an Affront to thrust the said Nose into civil Com∣pany. Without giving me Leave to answer for so inoffensive a Member, he instantly drew, and took off a Piece of it at once, that reduced it to the Size of his own. This I re∣turned with so sound a Blow, that swelled his to the Bigness of mine before its Amputation. Now, Sir, the Question is, Whether I may not in <HI>Honour</HI> cut off his Nose in its present Cir∣cumstances, for the same Reason he did mine before? A speedy Decision whereof will oblige me to be for ever,</P>

<P>IT is now something more than three Weeks since I issued forth my Order for the Ele∣ction of Rural Censors throughout every Parish in the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> This, in most Places, has been punctually observed, and with great Regularity and Order; but in others it has produced Discord, Division, and Tumult. The last Post brought me an Ac∣count from <HI>Smallworth, Wiltshire,</HI> That there were actually Two Censors chosen for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>me Parish, who, upon all Occasions, una∣voidably clash and interfere with each other. At <HI>Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewell</HI> in <HI>Hampshire</HI> very indirect Pra∣ctices have been made Use of, and a Person elected that had not lived Two Days in the Place. A bad Effect this of a most useful In∣stitution! If Church-wardens and Sides-men are thus open to Corruption, where is Justice and Integrity to be found? The Love of Power is without Doubt very natural to us all, and there are many Temptations in the Office of a Censor to justifie the Desire of at∣taining
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
to it: But to pursue this Ambition through unwarrantable Means, is in my O∣pinion no less absurd than criminal, because it defeats the very Purpose we have in View, and at once disqualifies us for the Employ∣ment we affect. It is a Violence to my Na∣ture to act any Thing that is rigid and se∣vere; but I very much question whether I shall not be shortly obliged to do exem∣plary Justice on the aforementioned Ac∣count. I have now under Consideration a great Number of Complaints from several Parts of the Kingdom, which in due Time shall be laid before the Publick. As for those Gentlemen who have been duly elected to so weighty a Post, I shall always treat them with a Regard due to their Character; and as the following Remonstrance came first to my Hands, it does of Course claim Precedency of all others.</P>

<P>YOur Order, dated the 13th of <HI>Janua∣ry,</HI> came to Hand the 18th of the same Month; and within the Time by you limited, the Church-wardens and Sides∣men of this our Parish of <HI>Fatland</HI> repair∣ed to the Vestry thereunto belonging; and having debated for the Space of Three Quarters of an Hour, without Eating or Drinking all that Time, they did then and there chuse, elect and nominate me <HI>John Hart</HI> Gent. to act in full Power and Au∣thority as Rural Censor of the said Pa∣rish, and did notify the same to me by <HI>Jeremiah Solfa,</HI> Clerk of the said Parish, who, by Order of the said Church war∣dens and Sides-men, having first washed
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
his Hands and Face, attended me to the Vestry in Form and Manner by them pre∣scribed; where being introduced, and the Door shut, they did unanimously vote, pronounce, and declare me the said <HI>John Hart</HI> to be from and after the Time then being Rural Censor for the said Parish of <HI>Fat∣land,</HI> and accordingly entered this their Act and Deed in a Book provided for that Purpose.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, Honoured Sir, how unworthy I am to represent so great a Man as your self in so high a Station, having little more to brag of than the Honesty of my Intentions, and a hearty Desire to be serviceable to my Country. I will be bold to say, that no Body shall outdo me in those Points, whatever they may in some others. Since I have come into Employment, it has been my whole Business to observe and remark careful∣ly the Behaviour of my Fellow Parishio∣ners, which is for the most Part as I could wish. I was always well esteemed among them, but upon this Preferment I am in a Manner worshipped. I have already been invited to Two Christenings, and several Junketings, which I hope will be no Re∣flection upon my Character, having heard, that you your self, Sir, will take a chir∣ping Cup upon Occasion. I shall endea∣vour to imitate you in all Things, though I am apt to think I shall hardly ever write so well as you do; not but I have had some Education, and might by this Time have been a pretty Scholar, if my Father had not wanted me in the Sta∣bles, and for that Reason taken me from School. As I was saying, Sir, I am migh∣tily
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
respected at present, and very often dine with the best Gentleman in the Pa∣rish, in whose Family I have observed some Matters which I think it my Duty to acquaint you with. His eldest Daughter, Mrs. <HI>Susan,</HI> and his second Son, Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣naby,</HI> who had before lived altogether in the Country, have been up at <HI>London</HI> Three Weeks of this Winter, and by the Improvements they have made there, are become a Trouble to the whole Neigh∣bourhood. The young Lady takes upon her to laugh at every Thing, and every Body that comes in her Way, and is ever and anon twitting the good Lady her Mo∣ther with having never seen any Thing of the World. I believe, if the Truth were known, she has invented Fifty Foole∣ries in her Dress, on Purpose to bring 'em into Fashion, and in Process of Time make the whole County ridiculous. The very Heels of her Shoes are laced, her Head not above an Inch high; she has Stuff enough in her Petticoat to cloath all her Brothers and Sisters, and at the same Time is naked her self half Way down her Back. I observed t'other Day a little Spoon in her Snuff-Box, and could not help ask∣ing her, Whether she hid it there upon a Report we had lately about calling in the Plate?</P>
<P>The young Gentleman is to the full as bad in his Way: His Cloaths are intole∣rably apish and fantastical, and he will face us down, that a Thousand of the same Make were seen on Her Majesty's Birth-Day. He has brought down a Set of new Words, to the great Confusion of common
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
Conversation, and pretends, that he had them from the Top Wits of the Age. He talks of Plays, Opera's, and Assemblies, as he calls 'em, to every Farmer he meets; and, instead of the Queen and Church, makes all his Father's Tenants toast the charming Dutchess of — upon their Knees. These and many other Grievances of the same Kind, are, in these young Gen∣tlefolks, the Effects of having seen the World; which, as in Duty bound, I hum∣bly offer to your Consideration; and remain,</P>

<P>IT is certain that most of our Errors, whe∣ther in Conversation or Conduct, are ow∣ing to Want of Reflection, and a right Way of Thinking. The Privilege of applying our Fa∣culties that Way, is the noblest Distinction of our Nature, and of the last Consequence to the Regulation of our Lives. This I do not offer as a new Observation, but only as the general Neglect of it, and at the same Time the Impor∣tance of its being rightly understood, make it necessary to be put often in our Way. What∣ever Improvements or Acquisitions we make without this Foundation, are but superficial and Ornamental at best, and will never support us through any Figure or Character in the World: For which Reason, when the Business of the Day, and the innocent Entertainments of the Evening are at an End, I constantly set apart an Hour at least to descend into my self, to weigh and examine my past Behaviour, and the Principles I have acted upon. The little Lei∣sure
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
I thus steal from the Publick is returned to them, by endeavouring to become more perfect in the several Relations I bear to Mankind.</P>
<P>In this Manner I was employing my Thoughts some Nights ago, when going towards my Window. I heard a Watchman in the Street cry, <HI>Past Twelve of the Clock, and a Moon-light Morning.</HI> Another, who came just after him, called the same Hour, <HI>and a cloudy Morning.</HI> He who had declared himself first, thinking his Veracity in Question, turned round in some Anger, and in a low sullen Voice gave the o∣ther the Lie. Words were multiplied upon it, and Blows followed. I immediately threw up my Sash, and had Authority enough to part them. For my own Part, I looked upon it to be a very bright Sky, and therefore gave the Fellow a Reprimand that had pronounced it otherwise: But when he assured me, that at the very Instant he did so, a Cloud was just co∣ming over the Moon, the Cause was puzzled, and I did not know justly where to lay the Blame. However, having made up the Mat∣ter, I pulled down my Window, and retired to Bed. Before I fell asleep, I could not help re∣flecting on the Oddness of this Dispute, and to make it of some Use to my self, resolved I would never more engage in Controversy with Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> or any other Person.</P>
<P>Soon after I happened to have some Tryal of my Temper, for amongst other Letters, I re∣ceived that which follows from my old Adver∣sary Mr. <HI>Powell.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Presume you will be convinced by this, that in attacking me you have ventured upon one who is something more than your Match, having lately had the Honour to fur∣nish the House in the <HI>Haymarkes</HI> with half a Dozen of my Seas tack'd together, and a Sail of weather-beaten Ships, for the Opera of Et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>. This I had never mentioned, but that the Persons, concerned therein, have had the Assurance to make frequent Use of Four hun∣dred Yards and upwards of my old Waves, without so much as quoting me in the Mar∣gin.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your humble Servant, <HI>— Powell.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I could not but be much surprized at so ex∣traordinary an Account, and doubting the Truth of it, went <HI>incognito</HI> the next Night to the House, where I found my Correspondent had but too good Grounds for triumphing over me in the Manner he had done.</P>
<P>After being heartily tired with the First Act, I had Leisure to consider the extraordinary Re∣ception of these Foreign Entertainments, and the Discouragement of our own Musick. I could no otherwise account for it, than by ha∣ving Recourse to a certain Journal that had a little before fallen into my Hands, in which I find, that on the First of <HI>November</HI> last the House of Ladies came to this Resolution:<Q>Resolved, That Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> never writ a good Song, That Mr. <HI>Clayton</HI> cannot set one, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mrs. <HI>Tofts</HI> sing one.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71"/>
In this Debate, I am told they all spoke, and all at once; so it being impossible for them to know what each other said, I could never learn the Reasons that induced that honourable House to pass so cruel a Vote. Two are chiefly al∣ledged without Doors to justify this Severity. The First is, That our Language is so uncooth as not to be endured, and calculated only for Acts of Parliament. The Gentleman that made this Objection, appeared at my Court Yester∣day, where being tried for Slander, after ha∣ving made a smooth Defence in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, he was found guilty, and sentenced to speak no other Words than <HI>Otway</HI> and <HI>Waller</HI> for the <HI>Space</HI> of Nine Days; as likewise to tran∣slate the <HI>Mira</HI> of Mr. <HI>G—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> into <HI>High-Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Reason, which is, the Want of Performers, has been pressed to me with all As∣surance of Success: But the Persons who pre∣sumed so far, upon a very solemn Trial, were found guilty also by a very fair Jury, sentenced to beg Mrs. <HI>Tofts</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Leveridge</HI>'s Pardon upon their Knees, and fined One thousand Pound each for the Use of the Queen of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> whose Treasures are exhausted, and her Terri∣tories invaded. I, who am advanced in Years, and have neither Leisure nor Application for the Attainment of a Language I as yet know little of, have more than ordinary Reason to be apprehensive of its encroaching too far up∣on us. Should it universally prevail, I am in a Manner debarred the Commerce of Mankind, and my Lucubrations of Course fall to the Ground. I could wish it were further conside∣red, how great Sufferers a considerable Part of my Fellow-Subjects would be, if we took away only the Use of a few Words, and whether any that can be substituted in their Stead,
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
would make Amends for the Loss. As for In∣stance, you deprive the Lover of <HI>Angel, Goddess, Cupid, Charms, Darts, Flames, Fire, Sigh, Die:</HI> 'Tis plain he is undone for ever. Take from the Critick, <HI>Delicacy of Thought, Turn of Words, Propriety of Speech, Diction, Image, Genius, Sub∣lime:</HI> The peevish Man will have very little left. Rob the Politician of <HI>Ballance of Power, Limited Monarchy, Hereditary Right, Church, State, Ministry:</HI> Most of the Coffee-houses would break, and even that of St. <HI>James</HI>'s be very thin.</P>
<P>After all, I am credibly informed by some of the Royal Society, that there is something in the Formation of a Tramontane Ear, that will not suffer it to relish the Softness of <HI>Italian</HI> Airs; and further, that Sound it self, at so ma∣ny Degrees Northward, was never known to come to perfect Maturity: Only that of Drums, Trumpets, Hautboys, and here and there as much of the Vocal as will serve to keep a pri∣vate Family in Order, being of our own Growth, and agreeing tolerably well with the Climate.</P>
<P>For my Sentiments of Musick in General; fitly introduced, and in its proper Circumstan∣ces, I leave them to be expressed by <HI>Shake∣speare,</HI> wanting Words of my own for that Oc∣casion.</P>
<P><HI>Antonio,</HI> in the <HI>Jew of Venice,</HI> speaks thus to <HI>Bassanio:</HI><Q><SP>

<P>IT is observable of Men of base Extraction and low Education, that when they have any Thing in them of what the World calls good Sense, they turn it wholly to the getting of Money. They have but that one Point in View, and consequently overlook all either difficult or indirect Ways which lead to it.</P>
<P>If they attain their End, and become rich toward their middle Age, before they decline in Years, and decay in Strength, and that their Appetite of Getting is not yet turned into an Avarice of Hoarding, if they have any Fire re∣maining, they commonly feel themselves war∣med with a Kind of Ambition of being Some∣body, as well as Something. They find a Want of that Respect which they observe to be paid to such who are called Gentlemen, and Persons of Condition, though of small Fortunes. They would give any Consideration to be of an honourable Descent, and alter the Spelling of their Names to bring them on as near as pos∣sible
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
to some Name or Seat of Antiquity. If that cannot be brought about, they push for a Knighthood, or an Alliance with some Family of Name or Title, whose Follies or Misfortunes have reduced them to match themselves or Children to Money, however basely lodged, or infamously obtained.</P>
<P>I fell into this Reflection after a Visit made me some Days since by one whom I remember to have known a Link-Boy, and who has often lighted me formerly from the <HI>Green-Dragon</HI> in <HI>Fleet-street</HI> to my Lodgings in <HI>Sheer-lane.</HI> We used to call him <HI>Foundling,</HI> a Name given him by his Godfather the Parish, and which he has not yet been able to part with, or vary, though he has found the Secret to be worth very near what they call a Plumb, and upon <HI>'Change</HI> has obtained the Appellation of a good Man. He came to me with much Frankness, owning both his past and present Circumstances; but what made me, smile, was, the Request he made me to accompany him to a House in our Row, where lives one <HI>Randall</HI> (as he called him) <HI>a Creature Merchant.</HI> This Person is a great Vir∣tuoso, and deals in Birds and Beasts, though not either as a Butcher or Poulterer; for he nourishes nothing that is eatable, nor ever ut∣ters any Commodity but while it is alive.</P>
<P>As we walked towards this Virtuoso's Habi∣tation, which I may call an Abridgment of the Ark, my Friend <HI>Foundling</HI> told me, <Q REND="inline">"He had purchased a fair Seat in the Country, That he had a Mind to appear well in the World; and since he had a Gentleman's Estate, he would endeavour to have every Thing sui∣table to it; That he had bargained already with the Herald's College for a Coat of Arms; and that his present Errand to <HI>Ran∣dall</HI>'s was, from among his Variety, of Ani∣mals
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
to fancy himself a Crest, in which he mightily desired my Assistance and Approba∣tion."</Q> I was delighted with the Folly and Frankness of the Man; but it happened he saw nothing that pleased him. As we returned, I advised him to an honest home-bred Crest out of his own Farmers Yard, which was a Cock's Head untrim'd, with the Gills and Comb en∣tire. This he approved, and took his Leave. I was about to reflect on what had pass'd, when suddenly returning he called to me, and co∣ming nearer, told me, he would let me into all his Project, and desired I would step with him to a Waterman's House hard by, where he had lodged a Set of Ancestors, which were to go up next Tide to his Seat upon the River. He desired my Judgment of the Choice he had made of Three Generations to furnish his Par∣lor. I went with him, not readily compre∣hending what he meant, till we enter'd the House, where he explained to me, that at <HI>Fleet-Ditch</HI> he had bought the Pictures of Three Men and Three Women, which were suited well enough to each other, and were to personate his Family up to his Great-Grand∣father and Great-Grandmother, which he thought was pretending far enough for one who was in Truth related to no Body that he knew of in the World. As I was extremely diverted with the Oddness and Extravagance of the Man's Fancy, I was no less satisfied with his Judgment in the Choice of the Pictures; the Habits and Dispositions of the Figures be∣ing suited to Three different Periods and Fa∣shions of Time, and concluding, or rather be∣ginning, in the Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmother, with a Pair of Trunk-Hose, a Ruff, and a Farthingale. I pleased him with my Approbation, and took Leave of him, en∣tertaining
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
my self often since with the Re¦flections which naturally arise from the Con¦templation of Vanity, Wealth, and titular Happiness. I have since heard there is a Mar¦riage likely to be concluded betwixt his Daugh¦ter Mrs. <HI>Priscilla Foundling</HI> and the eldest Son of the Lord <HI>Mortgage.</HI></P>

<P>OH Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff!</HI> If your Name, Per∣son, Authority, and the good Nature expressed in some of your Papers, are not all one Fiction to amuse and impose upon the World, give me Leave, in Behalf of a poor despairing Creature, to beg your most seri∣ous and tender Consideration. My Sister,
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
the unfortunate <HI>Fidelia,</HI> the best, the softest, and the fairest of her Sex, is even now on the Brink of Distraction. Her Perplexity is beyond all Example, and indeed the Occasion of it very extraordinary. It is now Three Years and upwards since Two young Gen∣tlemen of Birth and Fortune, who had lived together in the strictest Friendship, became Rivals on her Account. Both so equally me∣rited her Esteem, that for some Time she knew not on which to bestow her Love. The one was of an open Behaviour, warm in his Pretensions, but not over constant in his Application; the other close, assiduous, and importunate. However it happened, she was at last determined in Favour of the lat∣ter; and, with a Heart never before engaged in an Affair of this Kind, gave at once into all the Softnesses and Indearments of it. <HI>Po∣lydor</HI> (if I may so call the neglected Lover) now found himself but coldly received; yet, with an unexpected Evenness of Temper, con∣tinued still to visit my Sister; upon the Foot of a Friend, a Platonick, or what else she would please to call him. In the mean Time, the Father of <HI>Castalio,</HI> his Rival, had some Intimation given him of his Intrigue, and that he intended to marry <HI>Fidelia,</HI> whose Fortune, tho' better than Six thousand Pounds, was by no Means answerable to what he proposed for his Son. Without taking any further Notice, he sent for him, and having a considerable Estate at <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> made the Care of that a Pre∣tence for dispatching him thither. In short, <HI>Fidelia</HI> and he were forced to part, with a Flood of Tears, and the usual Vows to each other. Two Years almost past before any Thing was heard of him; then came the
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
News of his Death, confirmed by so many Hands, and such particular Circumstances, that there was no Room to doubt the Truth of it. <HI>Polydor</HI> all this while had gone on in the same Road of an innocent Acquaintance with my Sister, and as she ever preserved a good Respect for him, now, under her Af∣fliction, she found the Use of his Friendship. Who could so properly condole with her the Loss of <HI>Castalio,</HI> as the Man who had loved him beyond his own Quiet and Happiness? To whom could she so freely communicate her Grief, as to one who knew her Weakness, and had long since forgiven her the cruelest Effects of it? Thus, Sir, by mingling their Sorrows, they fell insensibly into a Tender∣ness for each other. His Flame revived with greater Violence than ever, and she on a sud∣den wonder'd at the Progress she had made, before she well knew where she was. Con∣sidering her self as a Kind of Widow, she re∣solved to continue such till a Twelvemonth was expired. She did so, and having appoin∣ted <HI>Thursday</HI> last for her Wedding Day, just as she was going out, she was met by <HI>Casta∣lio</HI> at the Door. In the midst of Joy and Confusion, she flew to him, and fainted in his Arms. What Measures, good Mr. <HI>Bicker∣staff,</HI> can be taken in this Affair? <HI>Polydor</HI> raves like a Madman, walks the Streets with his Sword drawn, and in case he is disap∣pointed, threatens Destruction to all about him. <HI>Castalio</HI> bewails <HI>Fidelia</HI> and himself, commiserates his Friend, and upbraids his Father that had intercepted his Letters, and purchased of several <HI>Irish</HI> Men the Report of his Death: But my Sister—she alas! is lost to all Reason; and if she were not, the Truth is, I have none to offer upon this

<P>The Case of <HI>Fidelia,</HI> as well as that of the Pretenders to her, is indeed very deplorable; and the more so, because having carefully per∣used the Records belonging to the <HI>Court of Ho∣nour,</HI> I cannot from thence inform my self how to proceed, or in whom to vest the Right of her Person. However, if necessary, a Special Verdict may be had without much Trouble or Expence. In the mean Time, to speak upon it in an extrajudicial Way, if the Lady happens to be of the <HI>Romish</HI> Persuasion, I advise her to a Nunnery; if not, and she be qualified as her Brother has represented, I know a certain old Gentleman who will be well enough pleased to take her off with all her Misfortunes and Infir∣mities about her. By having frequent Oppor∣tunities of instilling the Precepts of Philosophy, he may in Time alleviate her Disquiets; at least under the Protection of such a one, she may; as many others do, enjoy all the conve∣nient Privacy, without any of the Confinement or Severities of a Monastick Retirement.</P>

<P>THERE is no Consideration of more Mo∣ment, or which more respects the present or future Good of Mankind, than a severe and nice Attention to the natural Bent, Genius or Disposition of Children. 'Tis through a Neg∣lect of this, that we see so many Professions, Functions and Vocations so ill executed and supplied. I have often preached this to Major <HI>Matchlock,</HI> who himself had been an <HI>Oliverian,</HI> and could neither write nor read, and but scur∣vily set his Mark. His Consciousness of his Want of Learning made him run mad upon making his Son a Scholar. The Lad, who had an hereditary and unalienable Dulness, was ut∣terly incapable. Nevertheless to the <HI>Charter-House</HI> he went, where after having been for Four Years under a good Discipline, he was (if possible) more stupified by Correction, and returned again, like a leaden Shilling, upon his father's Hands. Soon after, by my Advice, he
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
was put to a Banker in <HI>Lombard-street,</HI> is now a Common-Councilman, will shortly be Depu∣ty of the Ward, and may in Time bid fair for the Chair. This is one Instance, and every one who reads this, cannot fail, from his own Knowledge, of recollecting many more. On the other Hand, a great Genius is sometimes overlooked, and a Youth ty'd down to mean Applications by having a Mechanick to his Fa∣ther, whose natural Fire, and Greatness of Spi∣rit, make frequent vigorous Attempts; by which he at length sallies from behind the Counter, breaks through his Indentures, quits his opprobrious Apron, and flourishes in Arts or Arms. We read, that <HI>Wolsey</HI> was but the Son of a Butcher, his Servant, the great <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> and who perhaps was as great a Man, the Son of a Blacksmith. An eminent Person of la∣ter Times was reproached by one of better Birth, though of meaner Parts, for having for∣merly been a Carrier. His Answer, for his Temper and excellent Judgment in it, is not to be forgotten, which was, <Q REND="inline">"That if he who re∣proach'd him had once been a Carrier, he would have been a Carrier still."</Q> To descend yet to a more modern Instance, my Friend <HI>U∣riah Pattern,</HI> by Profession a Salesman in the <HI>Strand,</HI> who sold me my last Purple Bays Gown, has a Son whom he bound to himself, that he might learn to make Clothes; but he, it seems, was only born to wear 'em. I cannot say that he appears addicted by Nature either to Arts or Arms, being of the Beau Species, and giving daily Indications of a Smart Fellow. The Symptoms broke out early upon him, in red Heels, wrought Clocks, Agate-headed Canes, Lispings, Patches, Contortions in Bow∣ing, Oaths, Shrugs, Smiles, white Gloves, with a perpetual Propensity of stretching out his
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
Hand to lead Ladies, not only from his Fa∣ther's Door, but from Pews, Pit, Box, or Galle∣ry. It was also observable of him, that when up∣on any Emergency he was forced to attend the Shop, he handled his Ell, and unrolled the Callicoes, with a particular Air of Scorn, Re∣gret and Indignation. What the Catastrophe of this Character will be I am loth to deter∣mine, but there seems to be some present Ma∣lignancy in his Stars. His Mother, good Wo∣man, came to me the other Day with Tears in her Eyes, and told me, that on the 6th of <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI> last he went out, to all Appearance, well in the Morning. He had indeed disgui∣sed himself in a rich Suit, by Means of which he was as much observed, as he was unknown, at Court; that he returned very late at Night, extremely disordered, and has rav'd ever since. His Imagination being fill'd with the Idea's of what he saw there, he frequently breaks out in Exclamations on Basset, Drawing-Room, Balls, Rigadoons, Minuets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He talks of Dut∣chesses, Countesses, and Yeomen of the Guard. A poor Country Woman call'd in to buy a Yard of Flannel, and he cry'd, Stand by. A Servant Maid came just afterwards for a Callicoe Gown and Petticoat: Asking him how much would serve, he told her, she must take so many Yards extraordinary, for he presumed she would have it with a Train; then offered to lead her to her Pattins, which she had put off at the Door, and wish'd her Grace a good Night.</P>
<P>A Person of less Penetration than my self, may easily see to the Bottom of <HI>Ned Pattern</HI>'s Case. To speak Poetically, he has, like <HI>Pro∣metheus,</HI> stolen Fire from bright Eyes that roll in an Orb too far above him. It is highly pro∣bable that he knows not the great Lady that has given him the Wound, and utterly impossible

that from her he should ever obtain any Cure. If he can be informed of her Title and Habita∣tion, I would advise him to entertain humble Thoughts, to aim at being introduced into the Presence, and by Degrees into the Favour, of her <HI>Abigail,</HI> the Possession of whom, though not as a principal Remedy, may yet as a <HI>Suc∣cedaneum</HI> prove effectual to his Recovery; a Method very familiar to us in our Practice of Physick: And who knows, but the old Clothes and tarnished Habiliments, together with the cast Airs and Second-hand Simagreex, of the original Beauty, may have a Virtue in them like that said to have been in <HI>Achilles</HI> Spear, the Rust of which never failed to heal the Wounds it had made<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> This is what I think proper to advise for the present, though if this should not have the desired Effect, for the Sake of my old Friend <HI>Uriah,</HI> I shall take <HI>Nea</HI>'s Case into further Consideration, and save him (if possible) from a Bed of Straw and a dark Room.</P>

<P>MY Landlady has a little Boy about Five Years old, with whose Conversation I often divert my self when I have taken my af∣ternoon's Nap. I was yesterday, with my Spectacles on, cutting out for him the Fi∣gures of Kings, Milk-Maids, Trees, and the
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
like, in Paper. We happen'd to be in warm Debate upon some important Circumstance in our Business, when <HI>Will Moody</HI> came into my Room, and seemed to wonder how a Person of my Age and Gravity could descend to such Trifles. He made me so tedious a Visit, and was so very disagreeable in it, that I long'd till he was gone, and young Master and my self had resumed our Entertainment, having a King to finish, who wanted only his Crown and a Pair of Hands. I have since reflected with some Contempt on those who think that Wisdom consists in a constant Tenor of Gra∣vity, and that they can never put off their Se∣riousness without breaking into their Cha∣racter. How ill Judges such People are of hu∣mane Nature may be determined, not only from the Opinions of Poets and Philosophers, but from the Practice of the wisest and greatest Men. <HI>Socrates,</HI> who, I think, may be recko∣ned in the first Rank of Mankind, was at Fourscore taken by some of his Scholars in the Fact, Whistling and Dancing by himself. <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Laelius</HI> used to amuse themselves with ga∣thering Shells on the Sea-Shore, and <HI>Augustus</HI> to play at Cobnut with some favourite Boys.</P>
<P>As all Exercise, whether of Body or Mind, requires some Relaxation, so we may observe a Sort of Analogy or Agreement between Men's several Employments, and the Amusements they fall into. Thus the Labourer, after the Toil of the Day, refreshes himself in the Eve∣ning with Wrestling, Dancing, or flinging the Bar: The dull Plodders in Business, as soon as they are disingaged from it, fall insensibly asleep, or doze over a Pint: Men of great Ge∣nius naturally fall into these Trifles which, at the same Time that they give Ease and Re∣spite to the Faculties, serve to enliven in some
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
Degree, and keep them in a gentle Motion. This I take to have been the Ease of those great Men whose Examples I have produced; and I am so far gone in this Opinion, that I be∣lieve every Person understands the Art of Tri∣fling agreeably, in Proportion to his Share of Wit and good Sense; those who are defective in either, being as incapable of doing it them∣selves as of relishing it in others. The only In∣convenience is, when Men in great or grave Stations are not cautious enough to distinguish before whom they give themselves a Liberty this Way.</P>
<P><HI>Will Moody,</HI> amongst many others, has fur∣nished me with this Observation. After much formal Advice against doing Things unsuitable to my Age, and telling me how much it would have reflected upon me if any but a Friend had come in, he added, That he was mightily shocked some Time ago by a Person of Repu∣tation for Learning and Virtue, that had enter∣tained him for half an Hour together with the Particularities of a Puppet-Show, which he carried his little Grandson to see the Night be∣fore. The Truth is, such sow and groveling Spirits as these have some Reason for their Censure, who possessing no good Qualities able to gain or to raise Esteem, should not presume to act a Part that would serve only to make 'em ridiculous. A Man who hopes to establish his Character and Fortune by the Solemnity of his Countenance, would be in the Wrong to part with it upon every slight Occasion. Should he once deviate from the Road he is in, he knows not where it might end, nor how to recover his Mistake. Even a Smile might be of dan∣gerous Consequence, and therefore he arms himself with an impregnable Gravity against all the Fooleries and Gaieties that may happen in his Way.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="92"/>
<HI>Democritulus</HI> is equally a Coxcomb, though of a very different Mould. He laughs for Laughing's Sake in the wrong Place, and is a Trifler upon all Occasions. In Pursuit of this Humour, he regards neither Time, Person, nor Circumstance, but lays about him without Distinction, and is a Kind of <HI>Drawcansir</HI> in Conversation. His nearest Acquaintance, and their tenderest Concerns, are the Subjects of his Wit and Ridicule; and he seems to value himself for nothing more, than for having got the better of Modesty, good Manners, and Humanity. How an Inclination to Raillery may betray one into Offences of this Kind, I must produce my self as an Instance; and as the following Letter has awakened in me a Sense of my Error, my Willingness to insert it here, will, I hope, in some Measure atone for it.</P>

<P>AS I take it, all Vices are altered by their Circumstances, and more or less affect the Multitude, in Proportion to the Character of the Person that commits them. This Con∣sideration obliges me (tho' with all due Re∣spect, and humble Submission, to the Autho∣rity of the Censor of <HI>Great Britain</HI>) unwil∣lingly to charge <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with ri∣diculing the Misfortunes of those who were properly the Objects of his Care and Com∣passion. 'Twas with the greatest Satisfaction I read <HI>Fidelia</HI>'s Letter, and the Introduction to it, in your <HI>Tatler</HI> of the 22d. The Case of that unhappy Fair is so moving in it self, and so well described, and her Brother so earnest∣ly and passionately entreats your Assistance, that I cannot without Indignation reflect on
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
your barbarous Insults under the Cover of your Court of Honour and a Nunnery; but what is yet infinitely worse, to aggravate her deplorable Condition by tendering your Flan∣nel Corps to supply the Place of her beloved <HI>Castalio,</HI> or the unfortunately successful <HI>Poly∣dor,</HI> is Inhumanity, and the Result of de∣testable Avarice, the darling Vice of an old Man, who, for a Prospect of 6000 <HI>l.</HI> can for∣get those many good Instructions a certain Author used to abound in, especially relating to the Choice of Companions for Life, and the Government of our prevailing Passions. Example and Precept are the best Comments on each other, and he that acts inconsistently, seems not in the least to be affected with what he says. Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> your Lucubrations tell me, you understand humane Nature too well to think, that an old Man, or Philoso∣phical Precepts, will either raise or alleviate the Misfortunes of a young Lady, especially under <HI>Fidelia</HI>'s Circumstances. Therefore to be consonant with your self (which you know is a prime Excellency) you are obliged either to vindicate your Proceedings, or make a publick Acknowledgment of your Mistake; according to the Consequence of which I shall continue, or cease to be,</P>

<P>THE Relation between Masters and their Servants, would, if rightly improved, contribute a great deal to the Happiness of both. <HI>Seneca</HI> places the latter in a lower Rank of Friends, and imputes the vile and abject Treat∣ment they usually meet with, to the Pride or Ignorance of those who have the Power in their Hands. For my own Part, I have ever had a Kind of Tenderness and Regard for the few I have entertained in my Service: I have at proper Times bestowed suitable Advice up∣on them, and to the best of my Power impro∣ved both their Morals and Understanding. By this Means they have gradually commenced
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
humble Companions, and served to amuse me with a Kind of low Conversation, at the same Time that they were doing the little necessary Offices about my Person. My Maid, who is now turned of Fifty, is of singular Use in this Way: As she is warming my Bed, she tells me a Hundred Stories of Spirits without Heads, black Dogs, and several Kinds of Apparitions, that have for <HI>sarten</HI> been seen in the Parish where she was born. In a Morning, when she brings me my Candle, she acquaints me how the World goes, and entertains me with her simple Remarks on the most considerable Men, and most important Affairs in it. This is ma∣king the most of her Capacity: But <HI>Pacolet,</HI> my other Servant, was a much greater Genius, and adorn'd with many excellent Qualities the high Station of <HI>Premiere Ministre</HI> to the Censor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>As the Publick has been frequently obliged to his Intelligence for the Detection of several secret Enormities, I cannot think it improper to give some Account of him here, of his Ab∣sence for Six Months past, and his late Return to these Parts. About the latter End of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> last he came to me, and after talking over some Affairs I had employed him in, he told me in short, he was grown weary of acting al∣together within the narrow Limits of this Kingdom, that if I would please to allow him a Salary, and send him abroad with a Cha∣racter, he would in a short Time visit all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and bring from thence ma∣ny Secrets and Curiosities worthy of my Know∣ledge and Acceptance. My Correspondents being numerous, and the Accounts they sent me very faithful and material, I could the bet∣ter spare <HI>Pacolet</HI> at that Time. Accordingly, Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> prepared his Credentials, in which
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
he was stiled <HI>Legate a Latere</HI> from <HI>Isaac Bic∣kerstaff</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Astrologer, Student in Physick, and Censor of the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> He set out soon after, and having made the pro∣mised Tour with an Expedition peculiar to his Way of Travelling, he arrived again at <HI>Sheer-Lane</HI> (from whence he was directed to <HI>Chan∣nel-Row</HI>) the 22d Instant. I received him with much Pleasure, together with the many Pre∣sents, Letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he brought me from Con∣noisseurs, Great Princes, and Writers of Alma∣nacks. I find by him that my Predictions first introduced me to their Knowledge, and laid a Foundation for the Fame of my succeeding Lu∣cubrations. He was, it seems, particularly well received in the <HI>North;</HI> the contending Powers in those Parts alternately perswading him to declare in my Name for their Interest; which he prudently declined, alledging for his Excuse, that he had particular Instructions from the Censor, his Master, not to meddle in those Affairs. Amongst other Things, he produc'd from his Portmanteau Two large Fo∣lio's, each of which, he told me, contained an Account of his Travels, the same in Substance, but differing in Style and the Manner of Wri∣ting. He added, <Q REND="inline">"That which I approved should have the Preference, and shortly be made ready for the Press."</Q> In the first Place therefore he read as follows: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>August</HI> 22. 1710. This Morning, having taken Leave of my Master, I mounted my Flying-Horse at the lower End of <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> and without observing much the Roads I passed over, soon arrived at <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> I baited there at the <HI>Cat and Fiddle,</HI> and after kissing my Lan∣lady's Daughter in the Cellar, proceeded on my Journey to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which I reached about Noon the same Day."</Q> Very
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
well, <HI>Pacolet,</HI> says I. <Q REND="inline">"Ah Sir! replies he, this is but a plain Narration."</Q>—Then taking up the other Volume, he begun thus: <Q REND="inline">'The Vehemence of the Summer Solstice was now much abated, when, invited by the agreeable Temperature of the charming Sea∣son, I resolved to make an Excursion into re∣mote Climates. Accordingly having by long Premeditation determin'd the Time of my Departure, I applied my self to that illustrious Person I have the Honour of appertaining un∣to, and having obtained a gentle Indulgence for my intended Peregrination, I gave Orders for my winged Palfrey to be brought to the Extremity of <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> where, amongst other noble Pieces of Architecture which salute the wondering Eye, that vulgar∣ly distinguished by the Denomination of <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> is by no Means inferior to any round about it.

<P>Here I started up in some Disorder, and snatching the Book out of his Hand, told him he should never more see my Face if he did not that Moment go his Ways and sleep till he had recovered his Understanding.

Time took my several Degrees in Conversa∣tion. At first setting out, it was my constant Rule to pay a Deference to as many as had any Pretence to it, to smile modestly when they were pleased to be facetious, and often stand their Raillery, without offering to return it. It was not without some Difficulty that I got this Mastery of my self, in Spight of which, towards the latter End of an Evening, I now and then made an imprudent Sally, and endea∣voured to be as sprightly as my Betters; but as it happened, I never said a good Thing over Night that was invidiously remember'd the next Morning: The Truth is, the Smallness of my Fortune laid some Restraint upon my Ge∣nius. I seldom rightly enjoyed my self till the Reckoning was paid, and by this Means my Gaiety begun when that of other People was at an End. At length, by an habitual Dulness, and other innocent Arts in my Behaviour, I worked my self into the Esteem of my Ac∣quaintance, and in something more than four Years was allowed to be one of the Company. Then it was that I began to exert my Talents, and by assuming every Day more and more, at length established an indisputable Authority in the World. Though the Impatience and Fire of Youth may suggest otherwise, these are certainly the Steps that lead safely to consum∣mate Greatness, in whatever Form or Profession we aspire after it.</P>
<P>I am indeed of Opinion, that some Years of our Lives are in a Manner thrown away and lost by Means of a wrong Education; which nothing has more effectually convinced me of, than the great and early Improvements that my Friend <HI>Sam Trusty</HI>'s Nephew, mentioned in one of my former Papers, has made under the particular Care and Direction of his Uncle:
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
But till the same Method can be brought into general Practice, we must e'en take the World as we find it; we must submit to the Rules universally received, and instead of weighing our own Merits abstractedly, consider them as they are placed in Relation to, and Dependance upon, those about us. Amongst other Grada∣tions necessary to be observed in Life, there is one which, for the Benefit of those who come Strangers to this City, I cannot but take No∣tice of; that of Coffee-houses I mean, the Violation of which may otherwise lead them into many Inconveniencies and Indecorums. The following Letter, which came to Hand this Evening, has partly occasioned this Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ection.</P>

<P>I Came to Town with my Sister last Night by the <HI>Reading</HI> Coach, and having both of us a great Longing to see Colonel —, who quarter'd formerly at my Father's House, we prevailed upon the Coachman to drive directly to <HI>White</HI>'s Chocolate-House in St. <HI>James</HI>'s-<HI>street,</HI> which was the Place he told us to enquire at for him if ever we came to <HI>London.</HI> We both alighted and went in; 'tis true I was somewhat ashamed to see so much fine Company, and the more so, be∣cause my Sister, who is always sick in a Coach, had but a little before pewk'd upon my Clothes. However, the Place I suppose is free for any Body, and for all their Silver and Gold Lace, perhaps I had as much Mo∣ney in my Pocket as the best of 'em. They were civil enough to her, that's true; but
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
they all laughed out at me, and an ugly lame Rogue there was ready to shove me out at the Door, and told me, I was mistaken in the House. If you think this to be good Manners, I have no more to say; if not, I don't see why you should not take Notice of it. You have put foolisher Things in your Paper; but whether you do or no, I am resolved I'll go thither every Day whilst I am in Town, and shew 'em that I am not so much a Put but that I can say bo! to a Goose.</P>

<P>There seems to be a true <HI>English</HI> Spirit in the Resentment of my Correspondent; but if I might advise, he should let this Matter rest for the present. In less than three Winters I will un∣dertake he shall be able to look the Enemy in the Face, provided he lives regular, and takes the Measures I prescribe. There is scarce any Part of the Town so destitute, where he may not find out a little Coffee-house to drink a Cup of Sage in every Morning, and peruse the <HI>Tatler</HI> as often as it comes out. Here I confine him for Two Months: If in that Time he can compass to have a Place kept for him by the Fire, to talk without being contradicted, and to read my Paper to the Company, he shall then, by Vertue of a Pass from <HI>Charles Lillie,</HI> be allowed the Liberty of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> near <HI>Temple-Bar;</HI> there to continue till the Booksel∣lers thereabouts have found him out for a Wit, and employed him in some Libel against the late or present Ministry. He will of Course pass afterwards to the <HI>Grecian,</HI> and may (if he thinks fit) call in at <HI>Tom</HI>'s in <HI>Devereux-Court.</HI> It will by this Time be proper that he should make himself a new Suit of Clothes. I could

wish they might not be too gay, which will by no Means become a Person whom I am con∣ducting through the World. According to the best Calculation I can make, he will, by <HI>De∣cember</HI> the 18th, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1712. arrive at <HI>Will</HI>'s, where, if he is capable of further Im∣provement, he may soon furnish himself with good Sense, Politicks, and good Manners e∣nough to carry him through the rest of his Journey, and set him upon an equal Foot with the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of St. <HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-house, <HI>White</HI>'s, or the <HI>Cocoa-Tree.</HI></P>

<P>THose inferior Duties of Life which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>les petite Morale,</HI> or the smal∣ler Morals, are with us distinguished by the Name of good Manners or Breeding. This I look upon, in the general Notion of it, to be a Sort of artificial good Sense, adapted to the meanest Capacities, and introduced to make Mankind easy in their Commerce with each o∣ther. Low and little Understandings, without some Rules of this Kind, would be perpetually wandring into a Thousand Indecencies and Ir∣regularities in Behaviour, and in their ordinary Conversation fall into the same boisterous Fa∣miliarities that one observes amongst them when a Debauch has quite taken away the Use of their Reason. In other Instances it is odd to consider, that for Want of common Discre∣tion the very End of good Breeding is wholly perverted, and Civility, intended to make us easy, is employed in laying Chains and Fet∣ters upon us, in debarring us of our Wishes,
<PB N="103" REF="106"/>
and in crossing our most reasonable Desires and Inclinations. This Abuse reigns chiefly in the Country, as I found to my Vexation, when I was last there, in a Visit I made to a Neigh∣bour about Two Miles from my Cousin. As soon as I enter'd the Parlour, they forced me into the great Chair that stood close by a huge Fire, and kept me there by Force till I was al∣most stifled. Then a Boy came in great Hurry to pull off my Boots, which I in vain opposed, urging that I must return soon after Dinner. In the mean Time the good Lady whispered her eldest Daughter, and slipped a Key into her Hand. She returned instantly with a Beer Glass half full of <HI>Aqua Mirabilis</HI> and Syrrup of Gillyflowers. I took as much as I had a Mind for, but Madam vowed I should drink it off, (for she was sure it would do me Good after coming out of the cold Air) and I was forced to obey, which absolutely took away my Sto∣mach. When Dinner came in, I had a Mind to sit at a Distance from the Fire; but they told me, it was as much as my Life was worth, and set me with my Back just against it. Tho' my Appetite was quite gone, I resolved to force down as much as I could, and desired the Leg of a Pullet. Indeed, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> says the Lady, you must eat a Wing to oblige me, and so put a Couple upon my Plate. I was persecuted at this Rate during the whole Meal. As often as I called for Small Beer, the Master tipped the Wink, and the Servant brought me a Brimmer of <HI>October.</HI> Some Time after Din∣ner I ordered my Cousin's Man who came with me to get ready the Horses; but it was resol∣ved I should not stir that Night; and when I seemed pretty much bent upon going, they or∣dered the Stable Door to be locked, and the Children hid away my Cloak and Boots. The
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
next Question was, what I would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Supper. I said I never eat any Thing at Nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> but was at last in my own Defence obliged t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name the first Thing that came into my Head<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> After Three Hours spent chiefly in Apology fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Entertainment, insinuating to me, <Q REND="inline">"Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this was the worst Time of the Year for Pro∣visions, that they were at a great Distance from any Market, that they were afraid I should be starved, and they knew they kept me to my Loss"</Q>, the Lady went, and left me to her Husband (for they took special Care I should never be alone). As soon as her Back was turned, the little Misses ran backwards and forwards every Moment, and constantly as they came in or went out, made a Courtefie directly at me, which in good Manners I was forced to return with a Bow, and, <HI>Your humble Servant pretty Miss.</HI> Exactly at Eight the Mo∣ther came up, and discovered by the Redness of her Face that Supper was not far off. It was twice as large as the Dinner, and my Per∣secution doubled in Proportion. I desired at my usual Hour to go to my Repose, and was conducted to my Chamber by the Gentleman, his Lady, and the whole Train of Children. They importuned me to drink something be∣fore I went to Bed, and upon my refusing, at last left a Bottle of <HI>Stingo,</HI> as they called it, for Fear I should wake and be thirsty in the Night. I was forced in the Morning to rise and dress my self in the Dark, because they would not suffer my Kinsman's Servant to disturb me at the Hour I had desired to be called. I was now resolved to break through all Measures to get away, and after sitting down to a mon∣strous Breakfast of cold Beef, Mutton, Neats Tongues, Venison Pasty, and Stale Beer, took Leave of the Family; but the Gentleman would
<PB N="105" REF="108"/>
needs see me Part of my Way, and carry me a short Cut through his own Grounds, which, he told me, would save half a Mile's Riding. This last Piece of Civility had like to have cost me dear, being once or twice in Danger of my Neck, by leaping over his Ditches, and at last forced to alight in the Dirt, when my Horse, having slip'd his Bridle, ran away, and took us up more than an Hour to recover him a∣gain.</P>
<P>It is evident that none of the Absurdities I met with in this Visit proceeded from an ill Intention, but from a wrong Judgment of Complaisance, and a Misapplication of the Rules of it. I cannot so easily excuse the more refined Criticks upon Behaviour, who having professed no other Study, are yet infinitely de∣fective in the most material Parts of it. <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Fashion</HI> has been bred all his Life about Court, and understands to a Tittle all the Punctilio's of a Drawing-Room. He visits most of the fine Women near St. <HI>James</HI>'s, and upon all Oc∣casions says the civilest and softest Things to them of any Man breathing. To Mr. <HI>Isaac</HI> he owes an easie Slide in his Bow, and a graceful Manner of coming into a Room. But in some other Cases he is very far from being a well∣bred Person: He laughs at Men of far superior Understanding to his own, for not being as well dressed as himself, despises all his Ac∣quaintance that are not Quality, and in publick Places has on that Account often avoided ta∣king Notice of some of the best Speakers in the House of Commons. He rails strenuously at both Universities before the Members of either, and never is heard to swear an Oath, or break in upon Morality or Religion, but in the Com∣pany of Divines. On the other Hand, a Man of right Sense has all the Essentials of good
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
Breeding, though he may be wanting in the Forms of it. <HI>Horatio</HI> has spent most of his Time at <HI>Oxford.</HI> He has a great deal of Learning, an agreeable Wit, and as much Modesty as serves to adorn without concealing his other good Qualities. In that retired Way of Living he seems to have formed a Notion of humane Na∣ture, as he has found it described in the Wri∣tings of the greatest Men, not as he is like to meet with it in the common Course of Life. Hence it is, that he gives no Offence, that he converses with great Deference, Candor, and Humanity. His Bow, I must confess, is some∣what aukward; but then he has an extensive, universal, and unaffected Knowledge, which makes some Amends for it. He would make no extraordinary Figure at a Ball; but I can as∣sure the Ladies in his Behalf, and for their own Consolation, that he has writ better Verses on the Sex than any Man now living, and is pre∣paring such a Poem for the Press as will trans∣mit their Praises and his own to many Genera∣tions.</P>

<P>THE Concern I have for the Errors of Mankind in general, does sensibly abate or increase in Proportion to the Rank and Quality of those who fall under my Observation. For this Reason I can never suffer a Coronet to pass me without enquiring whom it belongs to, and whether it be worn in a Manner suitable to so honourable a Distinction. I can say with a great deal of Truth, that I am commonly an∣swered to my Satisfaction: When it happens otherwise, I carry my Enquiry yet further, and inform my self with the greatest Exactness ima∣ginable, whether the Misfortune of Complexion, or that of Education, has chiefly contributed to eclipse the Lustre, and defeat the Advantages, of a high and noble Descent. Many Failures I find chargeable on the former, but they are not so numerous, nor of so dangerous a Nature, as
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
those which result from the latter, being only such Tendencies of the Mind as, by early Care and proper Application, might have been culti∣vated and improved into useful and generous Qualifications. It is therefore of the last Impor∣tance, as well to the future Happiness of our young Nobility, as to that of a Nation in great Measure depending on them; that their Genius should be nicely observed, their Capacity im∣proved, and a right Turn given to their Under∣standing. To effect this, I have sometimes had it in my Head to write a Treatise with Dire∣ctions to Tutors or Governors in the Discharge of so weighty an Employment; but being cre∣dibly informed that they were a Sort of People who had little Opinion of any Body's Wisdom but their own, I was discouraged from that Undertaking, and obliged to pursue other Measures. I have within this Twelvemonth made a Coffee-house Acquaintance with as ma∣ny of them as I could, and now and then over a Dish of Tea enquired into the Schemes and Methods they have laid down for the Manage∣ment of their Pupils. The first I happened up∣on, is a grave, sober, and discreet Person, turn∣ed of Fifty, his Countenance somewhat formi∣dable, and his Conversation extremely rigid and severe. He has by some Means or other seen the Outsides of most of the Courts in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and got a Smattering in the Languages; but having no Taste of polite Learning, nor a∣ny Insight into humane Nature, he is much better qualified to wait in an Ante-room, or keep the Accounts of the Family he belongs to, than to conduct the Hopes of it into the World. He has often told me with great Pride and Sa∣tisfaction, <Q REND="inline">"That he has his young Lord in as much Subjection as a Footboy, That he of
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
Course denies him every Thing he has a Mind to, and that in the Midst of his Diver∣sion he can make him tremble with a Frown."</Q> Such is the Love of Tyranny in mean and nar∣row Spirits, even in the lowest Circumstance of Power. Another of them sets up for a fine Gentleman, and is a Pedant in taking Pains to be otherwise. He has a Notion that Letters are but a poor Accomplishment for a Man of Quality, that a good Air, and being furiously of a Party, are sufficient Distinctions for one that is born to many others; and therefore in∣dulges the Youth under his Care in an immo∣derate Love of Dogs, Horses, Plays, Gallantry, and all Manner of Entertainments. At Lei∣sure Hours he flatters him with an Opinion of his Superiority to the common Level of Mankind, and strictly cautions him against entertaining the least Regard for the Scum and Dregs of the People. What a Patriot, Hero, and Counsellor, may we hope for from so extraordinary an Education! A Third, whom I suffer indeed to visit me now and then, seems to have a better Sense of his Duty in this Station than either of the others. Knowing that I am a great Lover of Chil∣dren, he one Day brought his Pupil, who is very young, to my Lodgings. He had long promised him, I found, that he would carry him to wait upon Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff;</HI> and I do not remember, that I was ever so well pleased with being pointed at in Publick, as I was with the particular Survey this little Boy took of me. After this Curiosity was pretty well over, he seemed willing to enter into Conversation, in which he acquitted himself with the utmost good Manners, and a manly Turn of Wit very disproportioned to his Years. I could perceive
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
he had a great Mind to be talking of the <HI>Tat∣lers,</HI> and I on Purpose led him into it. He made some very surprising Remarks upon several of them, and with an agreeable Freedom ask'd me the Meaning of others that he did not under∣stand. I begged his little Lordship to accept of the Volumes I had by me, and in Return he desired my Leave to be a Subscriber for the next. Ever now and then I had my Eye upon his Tutor, and could perceive in him an inex∣pressible Pleasure for the good Behaviour of his Charge.</P>
<P>I could not help taking him aside soon after, and telling him, that I almost envy'd him the Happiness of having so fine a Genius in his Hands: <Q REND="inline">"Go on Sir, says I, to cultivate and improve it, and by that Means be an Instru∣ment of publick Good to your Country. You will never, perhaps, have it in your Power to act in a more meritorious Capacity. Think only what a Pleasure it will be to you, to see this young Gentleman hereafter at the Head of an Army, or managing a Debate in the most illustrious Assembly in the World. Be∣lieve me, you will in a great Measure partake his Glory, and act as it were by Proxy in whatever Station his Merit shall advance him to If I can form any Judgment of him at these Years, you will from his future Grati∣tude and Esteem receive the Fruits of the ut∣most Pains you can bestow upon him. He will consider you almost in the highest Rela∣tion, and next to the Persons that gave him Life, will love and honour one that pointed out to him the Use and End of his Being.'</Q></P>

<P>DOctor <HI>Proteus,</HI> of <HI>Wadham College</HI> in <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> whose Letter I inserted in the <HI>Tat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> Numb. 9. is at last come to Town. The Whim of the Foot-ball went off upon the Breaking of the Frost, when that violent Exercise natu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally ceases. The poor Man is mighty sensible of the Condition he has been in, and is so far from being proud of the Spleen, that he is re∣solved to leave no lawful Means untry'd to get rid of it. He looks very ill indeed, and I fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t will be next to impossible to effect a perfect Cure, since by the Account he gives me it has run in the Family for some Time. His Father had this Misfortune so very young, that he was a Kit when he was a meer Stripling, and after∣wards became in his riper Age a very grave and worthy Hum-drum, or Bass-Viol; in which Capacity, (or rather Case) he served his Country (being at the same Time a Justice of the Peace) for several Years, and at last died in it. Of Seven virtuous Ladies that were his Aunts, Six lived and died Virginals. However
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
as <HI>Art finds Means,</HI> according to the Observa¦tion of the most ingenious Author of the Plai¦ster for Corns, I told the Doctor, if he woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> apply himself to the famous <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be very glad of joining with him, in or∣der to re-establish his Health. Accordingly he went Yesterday to wait upon him. But I was very much surprized when, upon his coming to me again in the Evening. I found he had not received the Satisfaction we both expected from the Assistance of so celebrated a Physician. <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Mr.</HI> Bickerstaff, (said he to me with a deject∣ed Countenance) I have been to see my old Friend <HI>Aesculapius.</HI> I found with him a young Man whom I took at first to have been a Pa∣tient; for he looked sadly. At his going out, I heard the Doctor say, <HI>Either forbear to use those Powders, or see my Face no more. Ah! old Friend, said he, upon Sight of me, this ex∣travagant Boy will certainly undo me. Have I walked up so many Pair of Stairs to get a little Money together, to have this young Fellow spend it at Twopence a Day for Powder for his Hair? Come sit down, let me know what it is brings you to Town.</HI> I told him my Case in as few Words as I could, to which he answered with a melancholy Look, <HI>That he was not at all surprised at it, since he was but too sensible of his having formerly been a Football himself;</HI> and to let me know what strange Impressions the Mind of Man is capable of, he assured me, <HI>That a certain Gentleman in this Town me long ago took his Face for a Spitting Pot.</HI> I was no less startled at what he said, than at what I afterwards observed. We were no sooner seated, but looking on his Watch, he started up again, and cried, <HI>Adso! we must think of Dinner:</HI> Then stepping into the next Room, he fetched from thence a String. Ha∣ving

fasten'd one End of it to a Nail over his Chimney, he tied a Leg of Mutton to the o∣ther, and giving it a Twirl, began a long Complaint of the melancholy Circumstances he found himself in. He told me, <HI>Every Body thought him vastly rich, but they did not know what the Expences of Life were.</HI> Then giving his Mutton another Twirl, <HI>'Tis true,</HI> says he, <HI>I have Fourscore Thousand Pounds in the Funds; but if a Man did not take Care to dress hit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dinner, he might be poisoned for all that.</HI> So desiring me to reach him the Flower-Box, <HI>Doctor,</HI> says he, <HI>What do you think gilding a Chariot might stand me in?</HI> Sir, said I, What need you trouble your self about that? All the World knows—<HI>All the World may know what they please,</HI> replied he, <HI>but you will see me want before I die. However,</HI> says he, <HI>I think it would do no Harm if we had a Dripping-pan now; Pray give the Box a shake, Doctor, whilst I step and fetch it. You must not take it ill that I put you upon these Offices, there are but few Friends I can trust to do them for me.</HI> He went on, <HI>Do you love</HI> French <HI>Wine? I believe you may; I did once my self: But let me tell you, That White Port is not only the cheapest, but the best Wine now about Town.</HI> Here I interrupted him, and desired he would think a little of my Case. <HI>Why, suppose,</HI> says he, <HI>you went to the</HI> Bath? <HI>I have been there formerly. Or what if you took a Lodging about</HI> Hammersmith? <HI>Or else met me at</HI> Tom<HI>'s to Morrow?</HI> I perceived it was much the same which of the Three I did, or whether I did any of them or no; so I e'en took my Leave, and came away.

<P>THE Dignity and Distinction of Men of Wit is seldom enough considered, either by themselves or others; their own Behaviour, and the Usage they meet with, being generally very much of a Piece.

This Kind of Insolence is risen to such a Height, that I my self was the other Day sent to by a Man with a Title, whom I had never seen, desiring the Fa∣vour that I would dine with him and half a Dozen of his select Friends. I found after∣wards, the Footman had told my Maid below Stairs, that my Lord having a Mind to be mer∣ry, had resolved right or wrong to send for ho∣nest <HI>Isaac.</HI> I was sufficiently provoked with the Message; however I gave the Fellow no o∣ther Answer, than that <HI>I believed he had mi∣staken the Person, for I did not remember that his Lord had ever been introduced to me.</HI> I have Reason to apprehend that this Abuse hath been owing rather to a Meanness of Spirit in Men of Parts, than to the natural Pride or Ignorance of their Patrons. Young Students coming up to Town from the Places of their Education, are dazzled with the Grandeur they every where meet, and making too much Haste to distin∣guish their Parts, instead of waiting to be desi∣red

and caressed, are ready to pay their Court at any Rate to a great Man, whose Name they have seen in a publick Paper, or the Frontis∣piece of a Dedication. It has not always been thus; Wit in polite Ages has ever begot either Esteem or Fear: The Hopes of being celebra∣ted, or the Dread of being stigmatized, pro∣cured an universal Respect and Awe for the Persons of such as were allowed to have the Power of distributing Fame or Infamy where they pleased. <HI>Aretine</HI> had all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> his Tributaries, and when any of them had committed a Folly that laid them open to his Censure, they were forced by some Present extraordinary to compound for his Silence; of which there is a famous Instance on Record. When <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth had miscarried in his <HI>African</HI> Expedition, which was looked upon as the weakest Undertaking of that great Empe∣ror, he sent <HI>Aretine</HI> a Gold Chain, who made some Difficulty of accepting it, saying, <HI>It was too small a Present in all Reason for so great a Folly.</HI> For my own Part, in this Point I differ from him, and never could be prevailed upon, by any valuable Consideration, to conceal a Fault or a Folly since I first took the Censor∣ship upon me.</P>
<P>Having long considered with my self the ill Application that some make of their Talents, I have this Day erected a Court of <HI>Alienation,</HI> by the Statutes of which the next a Kin is im∣powered to <HI>beg</HI> the Parts and Understanding of any such Person as can be proved, either by imbezelling, making a wrong Use, or no Use at all of the said Parts and Understanding, not to know the true Value thereof: Who shall immediately be put out of Possession, and dis∣qualified for ever; the said Kinsman giving sufficient Security that he will employ them as
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
the Court shall direct. I have set down under certain Heads the several Ways by which M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> prostitute and abuse their Parts, and from thence have framed a Table of Rules, whereby the Maintiff may be informed when he has a good Title to eject the Defendant. I may in a following Paper give the World some Account of the Proceedings of this Court. I have al∣ready got Two able Criticks for my Assessors upon the Bench, who, though they have al∣ways exercised their Pens in taking off from the Wit of others, have never pretended to challenge any themselves, and consequently are in no Danger of being engaged in making Claims, or of having any Suits commence a∣gainst them. Every Writer shall be tried by his Peers, throughly vers'd in that Point where∣in he pretends to excel; for which Reason the Jury can never consist of above half the ordi∣nary Number, I shall in general be very tender how I put any Person out of his Wits; but as the Management of such Possessions is of great Consequence to the World, I shall hold my self obliged to vest the Right in such Hands as will answer the great Purposes they were intended for, and leave the former Proprietors to see their Fortune in some other Way.</P>

Nine in the Morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Court being seated, Silence made, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mr. Critick <HI>Wordy,</HI> rising slowly from the Bench, spoke in the following Manner:</P>
<P><Q>Gentlemen, I am commissioned by the Censor, whose Place and Authority my Bro∣ther and my self, however unworthy, are at present obliged to represent and supply: I am commissioned, I say, to speak a few Words, as well in Relation to the Institu∣tion of this Court, as to apprize all such who shall be concerned therein, what they
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
are to expect, and in what Methods to pro∣ceed. As to the first of these Heads, I shall have Occasion to speak the less upon it, the Censor himself having lately in Wri∣ting communicated the Motives that indu∣ced him to erect so wise and necessary an Institution. No one sure can be so entirely a Stranger to the World of Literature, as not to be sensible of the many Abuses that have lately crept into it, which, unless a speedy and effectual Remedy were applied, would in Process of Time bring no small Scandal on the most refined Part of Man∣kind, and end perhaps (which I tremble to think of) in the utter Extirpation of Let∣ters amongst us. Poetry it self, the Attain∣ment of which (with Submission be it spo∣ken) I look upon to be one of the great Ends of our Creation, would in an Age or Two, it may be sooner, faint, languish, and die away.<Q><L>Ex illo ruere, &amp; retro sublapsa referri.</L></Q>
<P>I am in the next Place to acquaint you as briefly as possible, and as near as the Varie∣ty of contingent Circumstances will permit, what the general Issue will be of Causes de∣pending before us. As for Instance:
<Q><L>Si quis condiderit in quem mala Carmina, Jus est</L>
<L>Judiciumque —</L></Q>
That is to say, in this Case <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> the Plain∣tiff laying an Indictment against <HI>Quis</HI> the Defendant,—</P></Q>
Here Mr. Critick <HI>Snap</HI> in∣terrupted him, and said, <Q>In short, Brother, let us proceed to Business: Every Body that comes here knows what he has to do.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="131"/>
Then an Indictment was read against <HI>Jere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Wrangle,</HI> Batchelor of Arts, for that he the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>Jeremy</HI> did some Nights ago take upon him, in the Company of several Officers of Her Maje¦sty's Foot-Guards, to deny many plain and un¦deniable Consequences, under Pretence that the Arguments were not brought in Mood and Fi∣gure, and that he could not find in them either <HI>Major, Minor,</HI> or <HI>Conclusion.</HI> The Plaintiff said, <Q REND="inline">'He had brought the Business into that Court as having no other Way of doing himself Right on one that professed to be a meer Scholar. As for <HI>Majors</HI> or <HI>Minors,</HI> why the Gentleman should twit him with them, he could not imagine, that he had served, and at that Time had his Commission for Lieute∣nant-Colonel in his Pocket."</Q>The Court, up∣on a fair Hearing, ordered Mr. <HI>Wrangle</HI> to be divested of his Logick, which was bestowed on one Mr. <HI>Smart,</HI> an Ensign, nearly related to the Defendant, and then appearing in Court to put in his Claim. There was in an Instant a visible Alteration in each of their Faces: <HI>Jere∣my</HI>'s Pedantick Gravity disappeared, and his Cousin, the Soldier, walked out of Court with a becoming Seriousness in his Gate and Air.</P>
<P><HI>Tobias Sternhold</HI> was next produced in Court by his Relations, who had obtained a Writ of <HI>Captias</HI> against him. They alledged, That ha∣ving a Wife and large Family, which he might have maintained comfortably by his Industry, (he being a very good Clerk) he had neverthe∣less given himself up wholly to the making of Things with Rhimes at the End of them, which he called Verses; and that he was come to that Pass at last, that he frequently writ his Orders and Warrants in that Way; insomuch that the Commissioners had threatned to turn him out, which, if it should happen, would
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the utter Ruin of himself and poor Fami∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y: Therefore they prayed the Assistance of the Court. He pretended to justify himself, by saying, That one <HI>Genius,</HI> by Name, had drawn him into it, and quoted the Examples of <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Spencer,</HI> that could not resist the Instiga∣tion of Poetry, producing likewise some In∣stances of Rich Poets still living. Mr. <HI>Snap</HI> took him up short, and bad him not trifle with the Bench, telling him, <Q REND="inline">"If they writ Verses, it was in their own Coaches, or when they had nothing else to do."</Q> Then Sentence was passed upon him, <Q REND="inline">"That he should be <HI>Huska∣naw'd,</HI> and his Penmanship put into the Hands of his Wife.'</Q></P>
<P>She immediately took down the Proceedings of the Court in Writing; upon which he fell into a violent Passion, and such a Torrent of Words followed, as plainly shewed they had exchanged Faculties with each other.</P>
<P>Then the Court was adjourn'd till the First of <HI>April</HI> next, which falling on <HI>Easter</HI>-Day will be kept the <HI>Monday</HI> following.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment in <HI>Channel-Row,</HI> <DATE>March 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>When this last Sentence was brought to me for my Confirmation, I very readily approved of it; and though I was aware that the Term of <HI>Huskanawing</HI> being a Word unknown in any of the Courts of <HI>Westminster,</HI> it might seem an Hardship upon a People jealous of their Rights and Liberties, to impose a new Sort of Punish∣ment upon what has hitherto been scarce ac∣counted a Crime: Nevertheless, out of the Plenitude of my Power, and of my own meer Motion and certain Science, I do ratify and confirm the said Sentence. But as I shall ne∣ver
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
extend the Prerogative of Censor of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to any unreasonable Bounds, nor use it at all, but for the Good of the People; so for the Quieting of their Minds from any Doubts which might arise concerning this new Word, I have thought it convenient to explain to them what it means.</P>
<P>It is a Custom amongst the <HI>West-Indians</HI> that border upon <HI>Virginia,</HI> for the Priests of the Country to elect a certain Number of the hope∣fulest young Men, and of the best Families, to make the Operation of <HI>Huskanawing</HI> upon. When they have gather'd together Thirty or Forty of 'em they retire with them into the most inaccessible Parts of the Woods, where they build a large Stove, in which they sweat the young Men. They keep 'em to a very strange Diet, and their Drink is an odd Com∣position of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and Juices of poiso∣nous Herbs, which has such an Effect upon them, that they lose their Hair, their Nails, their Skins, and half of them their Lives, be∣fore the Process be half over. They that have Strength enough to hold out till Thirty Days, are brought Home in great Triumph, and these are looked on as the Top Patriots of that Coun∣try. This seems to me to be a very wise Insti∣tution, and fit to be introduced in my own Country; for the Sweatings, Diet, Drugs and Drink which they have been used to, quite re∣novate the Men, so that they come out without any Remembrance of their Parents, Country, Loves, Language, or even of their own Names. These are their Heroes, these their Counsellors, these their Ambassadors, these have the Ma∣nagement of all their Publick Affairs, and are maintained at the Publick Charge. I must not omit, that 'tis almost impossible they should, after this Operation, retain any Regard for
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
their former Studies, or in the least desire to return to them: If they should, they durst not own it, for Fear of being taken and <HI>Re∣huskanaw'd.</HI></P>

<P>A Writer who has the World under his Di∣rection, cannot better employ his Interest and Authority, than in cultivating a good Cor∣respondence between Men, and endeavouring to make them agreeable to each other. Not∣withstanding the Pains I have taken this Way. I have Reason, from an Accident I met with, to believe I have not yet throughly effected so great and necessary a Work. Walking the Streets this Morning, I met a Gentleman of my Acquaintance who has the Honour to serve his Country in a very useful Capacity. <HI>Oh Mr.</HI> Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣kerstaff, says he, <HI>you are luckily met; I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> your Advice upon a very extraordinary Occasion. You may command me,</HI> answered I, <HI>to the best of my Understanding; but 'tis a Rule with me, nei∣ther to talk nor look wisely in the Street. Please</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>
<HI>only to walk into the next Coffee-house—By no Means, Sir,</HI> replied he, <HI>starting back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> don't you know that some of the rankest—in</HI> Great Britain <HI>come thither?—Not I in good Truth, Sir; but if they do, I suppose there may be Room for us—Ay marry,</HI> (says he) <HI>and so there may be in the Dens at the</HI> Tower; <HI>for my Part I would as soon venture into one as the other.</HI> I immediately laughed out in his Face; upon which he turned away in great Indignation, and left me to reflect on so extra∣ordinary a Behaviour.</P>
<P>I went on, and having a Curiosity to see these strange Creatures my Friend had spoke of, called in at the Place before-mentioned. I was indeed surprized at my Entrance to ob∣serve the Eyes of the whole Herd turned upon me, a full Stop put to their Conversation, and their Dishes for some Time suspended in Mid-Air at a little Distance from their Lips. Turn∣ing to the Gentleman at the Bar, I asked in a soft Tone for a Dish of Tea. <HI>There is none made,</HI> said he, in a very surly Man∣ner—<HI>Pray then will you help me to a Dish of your Coffee?—You must stay till it is settled,</HI> re∣plied he, <HI>if you will have any</HI>—I did so, and called for the <HI>Tatler</HI>—A pert Boy looked in my Face, and told me, <HI>They did not take it in since it had left off lashing the Party; I might have the</HI> Review, Observator, <HI>or the</HI> Spectator, <HI>if I pleased</HI>—In the mean Time the grave People round the Fire had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle recovered their Confusion, and by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hispering to each other, and then staring at me, gave me to understand that I was looked upon as a Spy, or at least an In∣truder into select Company. One of them, more bold than the rest, seemed prepared to speak to me, and collected himself in a reso∣lute
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>
Posture in order to it; but his Courage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>iling, he sunk down into his Chair again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d suffered me to pass unmolested to a Seat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext the Chimney. A surly-looking Fellow, who seemed to be one of those who do not care a Farthing for any Body, sate opposite to me, and fixing his Eyes stedfastly upon me, threw out Three or Four of his main Principles in a Breath, expecting, as I suppo∣sed, either my Dislike or Approbation of them. A young Gentleman next him, who, I observed, filled his Pipe, and reached the Tobacco-Tongs for him, assented with a Smile to what he said, and could not but wonder, <HI>that any Person should be so proposterous as to think otherwise, or so insipid as to conceal his Thoughts if he did.</HI></P>
<P>The Calmness and invincible Silence with which I received all this Raillery, had like to have brought me into some Peril; for in less than a Quarter of an Hour the whole Fire-side was up in a Passion: Upon which I rose deli∣berately from my Chair, laid a Couple of Pence without Noise upon the Bar, and stole out in the same State of Neutrality that I came in. I take it for granted, if I had fol∣lowed my Friend to a Coffee-house of his chu∣sing, I should have met with the same Treat∣ment, only softened a little perhaps by the lucky Circumstance of being introduced by one of the same Society.</P>
<P>A Humour so absurd needs not any Anim∣adversions. Follies of this Stamp are too glaring in their own Nature to suffer any Sa∣tyr or Illustration upon them; to which, with some Alteration, may be applied those excel∣lent Lines:<Q><PB N="134" REF="137"/>
<L>When Actions unadorn'd are faint and weak,</L>
<L>Cities and Countries must be taught to speak:</L>
<L>Gods may descend in Factions from the Skies,</L>
<L>And Rivers from their ouzy Beds arise.</L>
<L><HI>Marlbro</HI>'s Exploits appear divinely bright,</L>
<L>And proudly shine in their own native Light:</L>
<L>Rais'd of themselves their genuine Charms they boast,</L>
<L>And they who paint them truest, praise them most.</L></Q></P>
<P>In like Manner the Embellishments of Ridi∣cule are thrown away in Cases where a plain Narration does more effectually serve the Ends proposed by it.</P>
<P>I must not omit mentioning a good whim∣fical Business that I accidentally met with in this Adventure. The Boy of the Coffee-house having put one or two of his politick Papers into my Hand, the Title of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> which I had never before seen or heard of, in∣duced me to read it over in such a cursory Manner as that Kind of Writing requires. To∣wards the End of the Paper, I found a Letter subscribed <HI>C— L—.</HI> After perusing it, I could not without Tears in my Eyes con∣sider the deplorable Condition of this poor Man. The Case of <HI>Ned Prattin,</HI> Salesman, and that of this unfortunate Perfumer, bear some Resemblance; and I have but too much Reason to fear will both terminate in the wretch∣ed Circumstances of <HI>Straw and a dark Room.</HI> Whether it be owing to the great Quantities of Snuff he has taken, or to Pride of Heart from the Encouragement I formerly gave him, it is certain that the latter has not for some Time been right in his Mind. His unaccount∣able Usage of me when I went last into the Country, was the first Sally of his Distemper,
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
which is now broke out into manifest Phrenzy. However unwilling I am to expose him in so publick a Manner, I must hereby warn all Persons whatsoever concerned about him not to trust a Penknife in his Hands, nor any In∣strument wherewith he may do himself or o∣thers a Mischief; that his Maid do every Night take off his Garters, and remove them far out of his Reach; that he be not permitted to drink out of a Glass, lest he should eat it; nor to feed on Fish, (although it be <HI>Lent</HI>) lest he should industriously choak himself with the Bones.</P>
<P>I would by no Means be misunderstood, as if what I here say were meant as any Reflection on Mr. <HI>Buckley</HI>'s Paper. Any Gentleman in his Way may insert such Letters as come first to Hand, and I verily believe That I speak of to be <HI>Charles</HI>'s own Writing. Only I cannot help cautioning Mr. <HI>Buckley</HI> against suffering his Correspondents to direct any of their Ad∣vices to the said Mr. <HI>Lillie;</HI> for who knows but in his mad Fit he may set up a Daily Paper up∣on that Foot, and, by giving it out in his Bills that he sells Three Thousand a Day, come into as much Reputation as the <HI>Spectator</HI> him∣self? For my own Part, as I observe some little Glimmering of a Genius in that Writer, I shall be very willing to encourage him in his Studies. For the present, let him make Use of the following Motto's, as he shall find Occasion, and I will hereafter take Care that he shall want for nothing that is fit for him.<Q><L>Que tam seposita est, quae Gens tam barbara, <HI>Caesar,</HI></L>

To this End, I have been obliged to ap∣pear frequently at most of the Gaming-houses, both the Theatres, and at Punch's Opera. At the latter of these Entertainments, notwith∣standing my Presence, there happened one Evening some Advances towards a Quarrel, when Punch, with great Resolution of Body, coming forwards upon the Stage, ask'd the Gentlemen, <HI>If they were not ashamed to commit such Disorders before himself and the Censor of</HI> Great Britain; For which Instance of Respect, I shall ever honour and esteem that incompa∣rable Player.

</LETTER>
<P>It is natural for a Man who receives a Fa∣vour of this Kind from an unknown Fair, to frame immediately some Idea of her Person which being suited to the Opinion we have of our own Merit, is commonly as beautiful and perfect as the most lavish Imagination can fur∣nish out. Strongly possessed with these No∣tions, I have read over <HI>Sylvia</HI>'s Billet; and not∣withstanding the Reserve I have had upon this Matter, am resolved to go a much greater Length than I yet ever did in making my self known to the World, and in particular to my charming Correspondent. In order to it I must premise, That the Person produced as mine in the Play-house last Winter did in no wise ap∣pertain to me. It was such a one however as agreed well with the Impression my Wri∣tings had made, and served the Purpose I in∣tended it for; which was to continue the Awe and Reverence due to the Character I was vest∣ed with, and at the same Time to let my Ene∣mies see how much I was the Delight and Fa∣vourite of this Town. This innocent Imposture, which I have all along taken Care to carry on as it then was of some Use, has since been of singular Service to me, and by being mentioned in one of my Papers, effectually recovered my <HI>Egoiety</HI> out of the Hands of some Gentlemen who endeavoured to wrest it from me. This is saying, in short, what I am not: What I am, and have been for many Years, is next to be explained.

This Affectation of Inhumanity is no less shocking when applied to other Circumstances of Life; and yet I am well satisfied, that some Persons are at more Pains to make themselves Masters of it, than others to arrive at the highest Pitch of Virtue, Generosity, and good Nature. It were otherwise impossible that an easy Fortune, a happy Constitution, and in short all the Ad∣vantages of Life, should strip Men of those Qualities, which, at the same Time that they were highly beneficial to the rest of Mankind, would reflect the truest Honour; and the most exalted Satisfaction on themselves. Amongst the many Refinements upon Pleasure which this polite Age has produced, it is a Wonder to me that so few have hit upon that of Relieving the Poor. This may sound very harsh in the Ears of a fine Gentleman, but most certain it is, that the least Reflection would furnish him with the same Observation. Were it possible for such a one to enter into all the disinai Cir∣cumstances of Want, Poverty and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ress, and to consider how far it may be in his Power to remove them, he would be content perhaps to part with some of his present Enjoyments, or rather, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xchange them for those of a more exquisite Nature.</P>

Delight your incomparable Essays give me, have with much Pleasure brought me to Town. It was so much my Ambition to see the Great <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> that the Diversions of the Country, and a chearful Fire-Side, had not Charms enough to keep me at Home. Soon after my Arrival, the Taylor, Semp∣stress, and Periwig-maker, equipped me for my intended Visit.

These were the Appearances that had sedu∣ced me into some Hopes that this Person was the Gentleman I had been in search after; but to my greater Surprize.

<P>IT is certainly very unreasonable that a Man, because he has some Wit, should set up for having more than all the rest of the World. Be∣sides the Folly of such a Presumption, there is an Inconvenience which naturally attends it: When one Man seems to grow into a great Estate in Fame from Nothing, other People are apt to enquire into his Title. The discerning Part of Mankind will be allowed upon such an Occasion to take from him what is not his Due without the Imputation of Detraction. Let <HI>Hilario</HI> be pleasant, and let some of his Friends have Wit; But does it naturally follow from thence that he is a Philosopher? And that it is the Effect of Envy not to allow him all those Excellencies he and they think he has?</P>
<P>Envy is a Vice of such a detestable and per∣nicious Nature, that I would have it not only

For my self, I can safe¦ly say I am contented with that Condition Pro¦vidence has placed me in: My own little For¦tune is sufficient for my Necessities, my Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are as many as supply all my Conversations<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that small Portion of Fame I have got, wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> give me as much Distinction in my Life-time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and as much Reputation with Posterity, as I desire. For this Reason I was never an Enemy to any Man's growing into the good Opinion of the World. I could with all the Indifference of an <HI>Idle Spectator</HI> sit still, and see my own old Wit every Day put to new Uses by other People. One dumb Man retails my judicial Astrology in <HI>Drury-lane;</HI> and another of the same Sort, who owns he lives somewhere or other, new vamps my cast Lucubrations, and cries my old Morals about the Street every Day in the Week. This is what some People may think a pretty fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Way of turning the Penny; let it be so, I allow it them. But when honest <HI>Dumb</HI> forgets his Name and his Nature so far as to set up for a Dictator, when he assumes the Magistrate, and prescribes Laws so Manners; in short, wh n he arrogates to himself the Authority of Censor of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I think it Time to as∣sert my self, and put a Stop to Encroachments of such a Nature. For this Reason I think fit to admonish that Pe son, whoever he may be, not to interfere with my Jurisdiction, unless he can prove himself to be me, an Enterprize of so vain and ridiculous a Nature, that I hope I need not go about to convince my Readers of
<PB N="155" REF="158"/>
the Folly it would be to attempt it. From my first Considerations upon Envy, I am naturally led to reflect upon some little ill Offices which have been lately done me. My Maid, who takes the Privilege of an old Servant to talk to me in an Evening while she is warming my Cap, setting my Slippers, and turning down my Bed; as she was in her usual Employment last Night, I believe, Sir, (said she) I should make your Worship laugh if I should tell you a comical Thing that happened to me t'other Day. As our Neighbour's Maid and I were standing at the Door together last <HI>Sunday</HI> in the Afternoon, there comes by a young Wo∣man; I thought to my self I should know her—So she comes up to me—Laud! says I, Mrs. <HI>Ann!</HI> I profess I did not know you—And who should this be but the Wi∣dow Gentlewoman's Daughter that lived at the next Door to where we lived before—How do you do Mrs. <HI>Mary?</HI> says she. Very well, says I, Mrs. <HI>Ann,</HI> How do you? And how does your Master do, says she—Very well, says!—Laud! says she, we heard at our End of the Town how an as if he should have given over his Business—Laud! says I to her again, Who should tell you so? Nay, says she, 'twas one told me so; whereupon thought I to my self, says she, if it be so, and if Mr. <HI>Bic∣kerstaff</HI> should leave off his Business, and go in∣to the Country, why, perhaps, Mrs. <HI>Mary</HI> may be to seek for a Place; and so truly I was re∣solved to come and see whether 'twere so or no—Thank you for your Love, said I, Mrs. <HI>Ann,</HI> my Master is a good Master to me, and I don't think of parting with him yet—Well, says she, as brisk as could be up again to me, if your Master be a good Master, a better

will do you no Harm: You'd find another guess Sort of a Man if you were to live with our Gentleman—Pray, says I, and who is your Gentleman? Laud! says she, how strange you make it! As if you did not know our Gentleman that lodges at my Mother's—Well but, says I, has your Gentleman no Name? No matter for that, says she, that argues nei∣ther here nor there; but if you have a Mind to have your Wages raised, I can tell you some∣thing more of the Matter—Ay, thought I to my self, is that your Business! so, Sir, I was resolved to take no Notice—So (says the to me) but Mrs. <HI>Mary,</HI> What makes you like to live so with an old Man? I am sure, if your Place had been so good a Place as you talk of, Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> would have hardly come away from your Master—Mr. <HI>Lillie,</HI> said I! Laud help your Head, as if my Master could not do without Mr. <HI>Lillie;</HI> Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> is no Rule for me, my Master was but too kind to him; and if I had a Mind to have served Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> a dirty Trick—My Master knows him well enough, and if he had not gone away as he did, my Master had turned him away the <HI>Thursday</HI> after—Nay Mrs. <HI>Mary,</HI> says she, if you are in a Passion, (and indeed I was as red as the Fire) good Night to you. Good Night to you, says I, and clap'd the Door after me.</P>
<P>Tho' I was tired with the Wench's Story, I could not help being pleased with this uncom∣mon Mark of her Fidelity: And at the same Time it was with some Indignation that I re∣flected upon the little mean Arts that were made Use of to entice away my Servant. I could hardly have believed another Instance of be same Nature, if I had not been assured by

<P>IT is in my Opinion no small Reflection on the Theatrical Entertainments of this Town, that the intermission of them should be looked upon as a Kind of negative Preparation to Du∣ties of the last Importance. This amounts to a tacit Acknowledgment that they are, in ge∣neral, calculated for our Diversion, without Re∣gard to our Improvement; that they amuse on∣ly and unbend the Minds of an Audience, in∣stead of filling them with great and noble I∣dea's; and serve rather to sink the Dignity of humane Nature, than to raise in us any just Sentiments about it. Were it otherwise, the Stage would have good Reason to remonstrate against so peculiar a Mark of Infamy, as that of being denied to the World at the Approach of any Religious Solemnity, and forced by that Means to confess an irreconcilable Enmity be∣tween the Pleasures of the one, and the Obli∣gations of the other. Notwithstanding all this, I confess, for my own Part, that I receive ma∣ny Advantages from going to the Play-house sometimes. There is, besides the Play it self,
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
something in the Circumstances of such an As∣sembly, that gives me a new Turn of Think∣ing, and furnishes me with Observations out of the common Road. I have a Pleasure more than I ever observed in any one else on that Occasion, in seeing so great a Variety of Faces, as well beautiful as others, and in tracing their several Tempers, Humours and Opinions in their Looks, Air and Behaviour. To sit Three Hours in a Crowd, is in my Opinion a severe Trial of a Man's Understanding, and from his Deportment there I can generally form a Judg∣ment on his whole Life and Conversation. Amongst others, I have ever avoided making an Acquaintance with any Person of either Sex who talked loud, or laboured by any Means to be distinguished from the rest of the Audience. My Friend <HI>Sam Trusty</HI> exceeds me in Penetra∣tion. He and I commonly sit together, and be∣tween the Acts entertain our selves with read∣ing over as many People as lie within our Kens. He enters not only into their Dispositions, but the minutest Circumstances of their Fortunes, can cast up their Monthly Accounts, knows how their Rooms are furnished, what they eat and drink; and in short, is at first Sight of their Persons let into the Secrets of their re∣spective Families. In taking a Survey of the Front Boxes, we are from thence furnished with many serious Speculations, whilst the more youthful Part of the Company are enter∣taining themselves on the same Subject after a very different Manner. We examine coolly and without Danger the Symmetry and Pro∣portion of a fine Face; and from the Bloom of a Complexion, are led perhaps into Reflections upon Light and Colours. We were engaged in a Conversation of this Sort some Evenings ago at the Opera, when <HI>Sam Trusty</HI> breaking

<P>I Cannot better shew the Concern I have for the <HI>Belles Letters,</HI> than in making such a Provision for those who are turned that Way as may best conduce to their Proficiency in it. The different Seasons of the Year are proper for different Sorts of Performances, which I don't remember any of my Fellow-Labourers in Astrology to have observed in their Yearly Almanacks. This indeed is a very gross Omis∣sion; and I question not, if Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> were alive, but he would readily embrace the Hint, and hereafter improve upon it. Suppose, for Instance, in a Work of this Kind one were to write <HI>Observations on</HI> April.<Q><P>This Month sow Hemp and Flax, pole Hops, set and sow all Kind of Garden Herbs; restore the Liberty of the laborious Bee by opening her Hive, bark Trees for Tanners, and let good Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ives mind their Gardens, and begin to think of their Dairies.</P></Q>
<Q><PB N="164" REF="167"/>
<L>In Gard'ning ne'er this Rule forget,</L>
<L>For to sow dry, and to set wet.</L></Q></P>
<P>Subjoining afterwards:<Q>This Month also lay the Plots of Plays, and de∣sign the Models of Heroick Poems. Set and sow the Seeds of all Kind of Poetry, restore the Liber∣ty of the laborious Muse by opening her Common-Place Book. Cut out Work for the Booksellers. Let extravagant Poets look before them, and be∣gin to think of Bargaining for their Copies.</Q>
<Q><L>Their Interest they does rightly measure,</L>
<L>That writes for Profit more than Pleasure.</L></Q></P>
<P>What follows from my Brother <HI>Rider</HI> is very good.<Q>The Use of Physick becomes now seasonable, and also Purging and Phlebotomy. Abstain from Ve∣nery; many Diseases will be taken thereby, to the undoing of many. In Cases of Extremity, pray to God for a Remedy.</Q>
<Q><L>Hei mihi quod nullis Amor est medicabilis Herbis!</L></Q></P>
<P>And I think the <HI>Regimen</HI> would have been perfectly adapted to Writers of Poetry, if he had added that ancient Aphorism,
<Q><L>In Poetry never this Rule forget,</L>
<L>To rise dry and set wet.</L></Q></P>
<P>I shall not pursue this Thought through all the Months in this Paper but reserve that to my next Almanack. A present it will not be amiss to range the several Speci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of po∣lite
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
Writers under their proper Quarters of the Year.</P>
<P>Those concerned in Pastorals I have elsewhere consider'd. To proceed therefore: As soon as the glorious Planet <HI>Sol</HI> peeps through the Horns of the Celestial <HI>Ram,</HI> Matrimony then coming in Season, I would advise the lesser Sort of Po∣ets to get their <HI>Epithalamiums</HI> ready. The Diversions of <HI>New-market</HI> likewise approach∣ing, let those who can write neither Verse nor Rhime scrub up their <HI>Rindaricks.</HI> The Haber∣dashers of Songs and Sonnets will do well to frequent <HI>Lambeth, Islington,</HI> and <HI>Richmond-Wells,</HI> and be prepared to celebrate any <HI>Phillis</HI> that should have the good or ill Fortune to be over-turned in the Park on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Night. Being informed that the Town is disappointed of an excellent Comedy by an ingenious Tra∣der's employing his Stock another Way, I be∣lieve I may put the Success of the rest of the Comick Writers into <HI>Easter</HI> Term without crowding them.</P>
<P>For the Summer Quarter, any one who has unfashionable Wares lying dead upon his Hands, as tawdry Panegyricks, or faded Sa∣tyrs, which neither please the present, nor hurt the past Ministry, is advised to seek out some Plantation or Colony of civil <HI>Indians,</HI> where perhaps they may barter them for Ale, Rum, and Tobacco; and if they should fail there, to proceed on a trading Voyage to the <HI>Bath,</HI> where, by altering the Names, without chang∣ing the Substance, their Goods will become Lampoons, and undergo a Fate reverse to that of <HI>Asa Foetida,</HI> which sets out a Perfume from <HI>Surat,</HI> and arrives a Stink at <HI>London.</HI> In one Place it is eat for Sawce, and in the other cures Hysterick Fits.

In either Case the Heir will succeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Estate at Quarter-Day, which is worth the Poet's Consideration. Since by the Inclemency of our Climate, the <HI>British</HI> Vintage usually suc∣ceeds this Month, the Dithyrambick Poets may not improperly celebrate the Manufacture of that Juice, <HI>which,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has it, <HI>makes the</HI> Britons <HI>bold,</HI> and congratulate the Return of Patriots to their Cares and Watchings for the good of their Country.</P>
<P>As I was meditating in this Way, I fell into a Sort of Enthusiasm: I seemed to behold a Chariot, that had painted upon the Doors of it a Snake with the Tail in its Mouth, which being the Hieroglyphick of the Year, as well as the Ensign of the Divinity of Phy∣sick, I was at a Loss what to make of it. Till observing it was <HI>corteged</HI> by broken Prin∣ters and Apothecaries, I enquired who the Person was I saw fitting in the Chariot, and what he could be writing. I was answered, That it was the Genius of Heroick Poetry, a
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>r of the First Magnitude in that Science, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ich generally rose towards the Winter Sol∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ice. I went up to him, methoughts, and said, O thou Antimonarchical Praiser of Princes and Heroes! Shall their Glories never be suf∣fered to pass uncommended by thee? When wilt thou learn how unequal to this Task even the best are in the most abstracted Re∣tirement? The Jolts and Rumblings of thy Chariot must needs affect any Verses, and make them unfit to express the Smoothness and Steadiness of this Hero's Conduct and Successes.</P>
<P>I recovered this Delirium as the Bell-man went about with an annual Sort of Poetry, which I had like to have forgot, though I have for many Years with Joy observed it to be a Fore-runner of Mince-Pies and Plum-Por∣ridge.</P>

<P>THE Desire of Superiority is very natural or at least, through the Weakness of hu∣mane Nature, has universally obtained in the World. This Disposition, in Persons of a pub∣lick Capacity, produces it self in an Affectation of Tyranny and arbitrary Power. In private Conversation the Effects of it are equally disa∣greeable, tho' less extensive, and serve to give one a Taste of Slavery in Cases of a higher Concern. A Man who has taken this Ambi∣tion in his Head, sets up for a Kind of Dictator amongst his nearest Acquaintance, and will suf∣fer them to give into no other Sentiments or In∣clinations than what are entirely consonant with his own.</P>
<P>It is worth observing, that every Set of Com∣pany does naturally, and without designing it, fall into a Form of Monarchical Government, and pay such a Deference to one amongst them as se ves to keep the rest in good Order. The Abuse of this Power is indeed very frequent, but without some such Regulation many great Inconveniencies would follow. The Diversions

<P>HAving a great Honour for your Perfor∣mances, I think it my Duty to acquaint you with the unworthy Treatment many of your Papers have lately met with. It is my Custom in an Afternoon to saunter from one Coffee-house to another; and as I was the other Day thus rambling about, a Couple of odd Fellows enter'd the Room where I was; one of them in his own short black Hair, with an uncommon Smartness in his Face; the other a thin meagre Person, having much Hunger and Discontent in his Countenance. Whilst the former of these engaged the Man of the House in a brisk Conversation, the latter, I observed, slip'd the <HI>Tatler</HI> into his
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
Pocket, and drop'd two <HI>Spectators</HI> in the Place of it, in order, as I suppose, to stifle the one, and introduce the other. They immediately afterwards went out, and upon following them in a careless Manner to three or four o∣ther Houses, I found them putting the same Stratagem in Practice. At last I laid hold of one of them, and resolved to bring him be∣fore you, when giving a sudden Spring, he broke loose from me, and with his Accom∣plice made the best of his Way up the next Alley. I leave it to your Wisdom to take some effectual Measures for the Defeat of these and all other your Enemies, who am, for my own Part,</P>

<P>THE Extent of your Lucubrations being such, as to take in whatever may be seriously instructive, or innocently diverting, I presume the following Relation may come within the Compass of them, and therefore venture to lay it before you as it accidentally occurred.</P>
<P>Happening to visit last Night an old Ac∣quaintance, whose Hours of Retirement have been spent in uncommon Contemplations and Experiments, he shewed me under a large Glass, Hermetically sealed up, a spreading Plant, in its full Verdure, strong and lively to
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
the Eye, which he assured me he had raised from its own Ashes in a few Moments. This naturally led him to a Rational Discourse on the Refurrection, which, though succinct, was managed with that Perspicuity, as to an∣swer to Demonstration all the Objections brought against it by its most formidable Op∣ponents, those perfect Masters of Reason's and of Nature's Laws, though very imperfect Christians, Moralists, or Men. But to return to the Plant: It bore the Figure of that <HI>In∣dian</HI> Weed (if it be lawful to call it one) that more than half the World hold in so great Esteem; and my Friend growing less serious, desired, that (while I smoaked my Pipe) he might take <HI>Aesop</HI>'s Liberty, and let the admi∣red Vegetable give its own History in the fol∣lowing Words:</P>
<P>Our Extract is of ancienter Date than that of Mankind, flourishing in the World before the Days of <HI>Adam.</HI> Our Parents, tho' wide∣ly distant from each other as Heaven and Earth, yet always kindly concurred in our Generation and Production, raising us higher in their Favour than any of our Sister Plants. As our Birth was for many Ages spontaneous, so was our Life uncontrouled; and while we saw our Neighbours devoured all by Rep∣tiles, Brutes, or Men, our selves securely ranged the <HI>American</HI> Woods unexposed to their voracious Appetites; for as we were Objects of their Love, so neither were they of our Fears. How did the Sun each Morn smile on us with Paternal Rays, and deck us with its clearest Gems, while the Gignatick Trees around (as our Life-Guards) protected us from the Fury of insulting Winds, and only suffered the Fans of gentle <HI>Zephyrs</HI> to
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
refresh us. Thus for long Tracts of Time did each reviving Spring cherish our Infant Days, and Summer's Heat mature us, dis∣closing all their various Beauties to us, and e'er ill-boding Winter, that mortal Foe of an∣nual Plants, frowned on us, we in a good old Age retired to endless Rest within our Mo∣ther's Bosom.</P>
<P>But alas! those happy Times are now no more! For a malicious <HI>Indian</HI> (for what Cause we know not) committed (some Ages since) a grave Ancestor of ours to the de∣vouring Flames, the Odors of whose Death procured us all the Injuries we have since received; for we no longer lived or died in Peace, but fell an easy and defenceless Prey to numberless Tortures, invented by the barbarous Nations round, to ravish from us all our new discovered Sweets and Vir∣tues,</P>
<P>This was not long our Case before the In∣habitants of an unknown World came, and inflicted on them as many Deaths as they on us; a just Return for their inhumance Treat∣ment of us poor Innocents! But these too proved, alas! as merciless as those, and have ever since forced us into Life by their mali∣cious Art and cruel Care, to be untimely torn from our Mother's Breast, then left to scorch with Thirst and pine away, and in∣stead of a kind Burial in our Native Soil, transported us to far distant Regions, where our withered Flesh stripped from our shrivel'd Bones, was cut in a Thousand Pieces by En∣gines of a dire Invention.</P>
<P>Nor are these last Complaints unjust, for though when plucked from Earth our Vegetation ceases, yet do we still retain our Spirits in full Strength, and so are never
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
released from Pain till totally consumed in Flames.</P>
<P>To enumerate the Qualities I have been famed for, the Usage I have met with, and the various, and sometimes contrary Effects ascribed to my powerful Operations, would be an endless Task; I shall instance there∣fore only in some few.</P>
<P>At first I was the Prisoner of the meanest Sort, confined in greazy Pouches, and visi∣ted with them my native Fields and Hedges: But I soon got the Esteem of those who kept me in a nearer, though a stronger Prison, and so was introduced to Shops and Taverns. Then the learned Faculty began their curious Searches into my hidden Virtues, and could not long conceal their good Opinion of me, which quickly exalted me to the sublimest Heads, so that the Statesman, Lawyer, and Divine, admitted me to their Closets and their Studies; and I have often since been the obstetrical Assistant of many a teeming Brain. How often have I created a keen Appetite to him that before had none; and, which is stranger, as often filled a hungry Belly? Many a Time have I received the Thanks of the Scholar at his Books, the Trader at his Accounts, and the Soldier in the Camp, for the Thoughts I have inspired, the Composedness I have occasioned, and the Refreshment I have administred. The Sick have praised my Cures, the Healthy my Preventions, the Solitary my Amusements; and thus have I gratified the greatest Part of the Male World, but generally been the Aver∣sion of the Fair.</P>
<P>I was once indeed the private Favourite of a Maiden Lady, but unfortunately discovered by her Admirer, by being forgotten to be
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
thrust behind the Hangings; and he, not a∣ble to brook so disgustful a Rival, immediate∣ly dismiss'd his Suit, which produced a Shy∣ness between the whole Sex and me in my ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm ever since.</P>
<P>But since I have been refined by the new Mode of crushing me to smallest Atoms, in∣stead of being kept Prisoner as before to ex∣pire in Flames, I have had all the Riches of the <HI>East</HI> bestowed in fitting up Apartments for me, and am become the constant and be∣loved Companion of the most celebrated Wits and Beauties. I freely visit now the Church, the Court, the Mansions of the Great, the Tea-Table, and the Closet, and every Re∣sort of highest Quality.</P>
<P>Nay, I'm not refused the Virgin Bed, but often dwell at Midnight on the sweetest Lips, and wake the chastest Fair with Longings to embrace me. By this new Art I gain a free Admission to the Brain too, and am as it were immortalized by being almost mixed with Thought it self. But what I value more than all is, that I am the richest Jewel in the <HI>British</HI> Diadem.</P>
<P>So concluded my Friend and Pipe, and so concludes,</P>

<P>HAving, as I formerly observed, passed through an infinite Variety of Scenes in humane Life, I cannot better employ the Re∣flections I have made upon them, than by in∣structing those in the Paths they ought to pur∣sue whose Youth and Unexperience would o∣therwise betray them into a Thousand Mi∣stakes. Of all others I have a tender Regard for such as apply themselves to those Arts and Sciences which gave me some Reputation in the Days of the Emperor <HI>Trajan.</HI> I was esteem∣ed the greatest Wit of that Age; but, by a
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
Misapplication of my Parts and Learning, came to an ignoble End. This is a reigning Misfortune amongst the Genius's of the present Age, but has indeed prevailed much more in some foregoing Reigns. It is with the utmost Indignation that I see many great Capacities prostituted to the most unworthy Purposes, and the World in a Manner corrupted and de∣bauched by Persons whose Talents seem in∣tended for the Ornament and Reformation of it. Next to the Want of Morality, I bewail the Narrowness of Fortune which too often presses Men of a liberal Education, and which perhaps is one Step towards leading them into the former. A young Fellow who is uneasy in his Circumstances, is naturally betrayed into those Follies which recommend him to Compa∣ny, and give him Hopes of making an Ac∣quaintance that may one Time or other turn to his Advantage. With this View he gives into many Fooleries that he secretly despises, and at last is harden'd into Vices which he former∣ly abhorred. The Students of both Universi∣ties are on this Account in a peculiar Manner the Objects of my Care and Concern. As of∣ten as I see a new Face about Town, that pro∣mises much good Understanding, and a lively Imagination, I conclude it came up by the last Coach from <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge.</HI> I am im∣mediately upon the Rack to consider the many Difficulties such a one must encounter, the At∣tendance he must pay to insolent Greatness, the frequent Shocks he will receive from the Promotion of inferior Merit, from the Dissimu∣lation of some, and the Envy of others; and at last, from the mean Reward he is likely to meet with for a long Course of Slavery and Dependance.</P>

<P>IF the Distresses of Mankind do really fit so near you as we are given to understand by your Paper of the 27th of the last Month, I have but too just a Right to your Compas∣sion, and the most tender Advice you can bestow upon me.</P>
<P>It was not long since my good Fortune to be a Member of — College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I spent Four Years in a Manner per∣fectly innocent and agreeable to my Temper. Good Part of my Time was spent in Reading, the rest in such Amusements as the Place af∣forded. I was generally well esteemed by the few I was known to, and being not much turned to Gallantry, made a Shift to be easy without the Company of Ladies, which, eve∣ry Body knows, are scarce in those Parts. During this Retirement, I happened to write a Copy of Verses which alarmed Two or Three of the Top Booksellers in this Town, and gave them Hopes of me for a future Author of some more considerable Work. Whether they employed my Acquaintance to flatter me on that Occasion I know not, but, to my utter Ruin, I received incredible Ap∣plause for my Performance. Soon after, I took it in my Head that the University was too narrow a Sphere for me to act in. I
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
formed to my self great Notions of my Re∣putation at <HI>London,</HI> and thought it would be taken amiss, if I did not go and visit my Friends and Admirers there. I made a Jour∣ney accordingly, and had the Honour to be introduced to some Persons of a considerable Figure. Now, thought I, my Fortune is made; I have seen the greatest General, and the best Poet in <HI>Europe.</HI> My old Friends in the mean Time whom I had left behind me, sent frequent Letters of Congratulation upon the Prospect I had of coming into the Mini∣stry, which I received, and answered with the Air and Style of one that was already in Em∣ployment. I affected, for Instance, a new Way of writing my Name, of making up my Paper, and of subscribing my self according to the Forms received in the Offices about <HI>Whitehall.</HI> The great Civility and good Man∣ners of many whom I was presented to, had like to have led me into some Mistake: Through my great Ignorance, and Want of Breeding, I believed every Word they said to me; and when they assured me, <HI>they would do me any Service that lay in their Power, that they had a great Opinion of my Merit, and only wanted an Opportunity to shew it;</HI> I had no more Complaisance than to take them at their Words, and look out for Occasions of trying their Friendship. In the mean while my slender Fortune run out a∣pace; the Spleen succeeded, and I am now, in every Essential, as errant a Wit as any about Town. Words cannot express the Shame, Scorn, and Regret I have for my past Indiscretion, which I can no other∣wise atone for than by laying it open in this Way for the Good of others, and applying at the same Time for Advice to Mr. <HI>Bicker∣staff</HI>

<P>IN taking a Survey of Mankind, one cannot but observe an universal Pursuit of what they call Pleasure, and at the same Time the grossest Mistakes about the Notion of it. Not to enter into more Particulars, let it suffice, that in the Catalogue of Things conducing to this End, Friendship is generally omitted, and either not at all considered, or else exploded and laughed out of Countenance. The Truth is, our Vanity seems to have got the better of our Reason, and choose rather to appear happy than be so. Hence it is, that instead of cultivating an Intimacy with a few, we make a superficial Acquaintance with all that offer, and are more desirous of being seen by a Multi∣tude, than rightly known and understood by any. The Want of Virtue is at the Bottom of all this: Having no true Principles of Honour, Generosity, or good Nature, we naturally a∣void being too strictly enquired into, and there∣fore are cautious that those about us should not take any Freedom beyond what a mixed
<PB N="184" REF="187"/>
Kind of Conversation will allow. It is suf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦cient that a Set of unthinking young Fello<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> can meet over a Bottle, and make a Shift <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pass the Time with trifling and indifferent T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦picks, without ever entertaining the least m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tual Regard, or examining into the Merits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one another. It will be difficult to perswad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such Men that they have not yet tasted one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most exquisite Enjoyments that the Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> capable of, or that they have it in their Powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to open to themselves a more delightful Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Living than they have hitherto been ac¦quainted with. Talking the other Day with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very young Gentleman on this Subject, I could not help asking him, <Q REND="inline">"Whether, amongst the many Affairs he had made with the Ladies, he had never yet happened to have one of an honourable Nature upon his Hands?"</Q> He frankly confessed he had; and upon being fur∣ther pressed, <Q REND="inline">"That he found more Satisfaction in the Pursuit of That, than from all the Successes he ever met with in those of ano∣ther Kind."</Q> <Q REND="inline"> "Believe me then (said I) there is no less Difference between the idle Amusement of a common Acquaintance, and the refined Endearments of an intimate Friendship."</Q> I insisted the more on this Point with a Person who was as yet in a great Measure a Stranger to the World, because it is very certain, that the sooner this Notion is re∣ceived, the more advantageous it proves, and is a Means of preventing many Miscarriages in our Behaviour. For my own Part, amongst a Thousand other Obligations which I owe to my Parents, I must particularly acknowledge that of instilling an early Benevolence to Man∣kind in general, and a Desire of fixing my self in the Affections of one or more who should appear best qualified for so near an Alliance.
<PB N="185" REF="188"/>
<HI>Sam Trusty,</HI> whom I have often mentioned in these Papers, was almost my first Choice, and has preserved me from many Errors which Youth and Indiscretion would otherwise have led me into. I am infinitely obliged to my Cousin <HI>Humphry Wagstaff</HI> on the same Account, as well as for the great Assistance he has given me in the Prosecution of this Work. My Con∣versation with each of these Gentlemen is a Kind of elegant Retirement from the World, as it furnishes me with the justest Remarks upon the several Occurrences in it. Our Sen∣timents are communicated without Reserve, insomuch that our ordinary Discourse is by the latter stiled Thinking aloud. In this happy Situation of Life we stand less exposed than others commonly are, either to the Strokes of Fortune, the Ill-nature of our Enemies, or any Calamity that can befal us. In the mean Time all our Enjoyments, by being shared amongst us, are heightened and improved in Propor∣tion to the Pleasure that every Individual re∣ceives from them.</P>
<P>In order to make Mankind happy in the Relish of so refined a Commerce with each other, I could wish our present Writers of Plays, instead of filling their Works of that Sort with the Business of Love, would some∣times diversify them with the Distress of Friends, their Heroick Behaviour under it, with all the beautiful Incidents that History can furnish, or a warm and noble Imagina∣tion suggest upon that Model. I am sensible how great a Genius is required to this Task; but whenever the Prudence of our Superiors shall think fit to deliver the Stage from the State of Slavery and Mismanagement it now labours under, I shall not despair of seeing

<P>I Came hither about a Week since, being forced from <HI>London,</HI> where I spent the Winter, by the Commands of my Mother, who took it in her Head that I grew too fond of that Place, and was in Danger of throwing my self away upon some idle young Fellow or other. It is not to be ex∣pressed how melancholy I am here: My Heart akes at this Instant as if it would break; I look upon no one Object with Pleasure. The Fellows whom I liked well enough Half a Year ago, appear silly and aukward, and even the Cathedral Church, of a <HI>Sunday,</HI> affords me no Entertainment.
<PB N="193" REF="196"/>
What shall I do, dear Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> to re∣move the Heaviness that sits upon my Heart? How shall I divert my self in this wild and solitary Retreat? Formerly indeed I could spend whole Days and Nights in turning over my Romances; I could with infinite Pleasure rove about the Wilderness, in our Garden, and charm the Rival Nightingales with the Musick of my Flute. How often have I there unbound my Silver Locks, and given them to be the Sport of wanton <HI>Ze∣phyrs?</HI> Young ruddy Damsels waited round me, and decking me forth with all the Pride and Beauty of the Spring, proclaimed me Goddess of the Place—Oh cursed <HI>Damon</HI>—That dear dissembling Youth! He, alas! has robbed me of my Innocence, and with it, of all the pleasing Errors that made Soli∣tude delightful, and gilded over these Silvan Scenes—</P>
<P>He in short, Sir, has turned my Notions another Way, and given me a new Set of Desires and Inclinations. If you will bestow some Advice upon me, I will endeavour to follow it, and give you a constant Account of the Success it has with me. If I at all understand my own Case, I am by my pre∣sent Circumstances very well qualified for a Rural Censor, and can see no Reason why Women should be excluded that Office. I promise you to have a very strict Eye upon my own Sex, and may perhaps let you into some Secrets relating to them that have hi∣therto escaped your Censure. The faithful Execution of this Employment will be a Means to divert my own Spleen, and may perhaps conduce to the Gratification of yours, and that of many Thousands more. I will in all Things act as becomes the Substitute of

</LETTER>
<P>The Case of <HI>Belinda</HI> is in my Opinion very deplorable, and would, if fully considered, give Occasion to many useful Reflections. At present I shall only observe upon it, that the Blemish she has received in her own Character is by no Means a Step towards a Power and Jurisdiction over the Conduct of others. I am not unwilling to admit some of the Fair Sex into the Employment she sollicits for, having in general a great Opinion of their Capacities, as well as of their earnest Desire to reform the Manners of those about them. It may not however be amiss to give the Electors in this Point a short Abstract of the Qualifications re∣quisite to a Female Censor, lest any Mistakes should happen upon so weighty an Affair: As first, That she is indeed with an habitual Si∣lence; Secondly, That she has a known Ha∣tred to Scandal and Detraction; Thirdly, That she neither pays nor receives any impertinent Visits; Fourthly, That she is a constant Rea∣der of the <HI>Tatler;</HI> And Fifthly and Lastly, That she has, besides other Books, a huge <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of Receipts.</P>

By this Means he has raised the Expectation of all who have seen the Piece, to my great Disad∣vantage in the Disposal of my Person.

For my own Sake therefore, and that of many others in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Cir∣cumstances, I humbly move the Court for speedy Sentence on so notorious an Offen∣der.</P>

<P>I Have examined your Lucubrations with the utmost Care and Diligence, but can find nothing relating to my present Case. Whether your Thoughts have been employed on more useful Subjects, or whether Circum∣stances so entirely alter the Nature of Things that it is impossible to define them; but if so it happens, that the Importunity which a Man should use in the Recovery of his Own has wholly escaped you, I could read a Dis∣sertation of yours upon Dunning with more Pleasure than I ever looked at a new-fashio∣ned

Toy. You only can direct us how far a Gentleman may be decently pressed, and whether Personally or by Billet is the more proper Method.</P>
<P>If you knew how much I was interested in this Affair, I perswade my self, your Concern for the Sex would hasten your Resolution. I cannot look at poor <HI>Charles</HI>'s Face without bathing it with a Flood of Tears. Had he sold Cast Work for Hammer'd, or Horn for Tortoise-Shell, I could moderate my Resent∣ments; but to be kick'd, disabled, and caned like a Stockfish for only demanding his Due, is an Indignity not to be suffered in a free Country.</P>
<P>Good Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> take a distressed Wo∣man into your Protection, and give me such Redress as you in your great Wisdom shall judge suitable to the Offence, and believe my Application to the Censor of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> to proceed only from the Equity<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have observed in all your Determinations.

<P>ONE great Design of this Paper is to re∣concile Men to their several Stations in Life, and to remove that Uneasiness which commonly arises from the supposed Advantages of those about them. Unless this be in some Measure effected, it is in vain to expect any great Success from Precepts of another Kind; a Person who is out of Humour being as in∣capable of receiving Advice as bestowing it on others. The Stake chiefly contended for is Power, and this, if I mistake not, is more equally divided than we commonly imagine. The executive Part of it seems indeed to be pretty much engross'd by Men of great For∣tunes and large Possessions. They, 'tis true, carry about them all the Distinctions of Gran∣deur and Superiority, they are attended by Maces, adorned with Ribands, and crowded by a numerous Train of Dependants. In the
<PB N="198" REF="201"/>
mean Time it must be no small Satisfaction for a Man who is inclined to envy them such pom∣pous Appearances, to make a strict Enquiry in∣to some other Circumstances which are not al∣together so much exposed to the publick View. He will by this Means discover that these great Machines are informed, turned and directed by the most minute Springs and Movements; that in many Instances, a menial Servant has the Management of their highest Concerns, and disposes of their Actions as he in his great Wisdom shall judge most convenient for them.</P>
<P>As my Cousin <HI>Humphrey</HI> and my self were taking a Walk in the <HI>Park</HI> the other Day, a Person of Note passed by us with an Air of Inso∣lence and Contempt, attended by a very mag∣nificent Equipage. He, with his usual Free∣dom, taking me aside, desired me to observe that fine Thing, and to give my Opinion of him. Observing me a little reserved upon the Matter, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Isaac</HI> (says he) with some Indigna∣tion, You are the greatest Coward in the World: Had I put the same Question to you upon Fifty others of Five hundred Times the Worth of inferior Rank, you would have made no Scruple of speaking your Sentiments. I will tell you then; That Gentleman you see there, is one Way or other in Subjection to every one of those Fellows that dangle after him. I happen (continued he) to be well ac∣quainted in his Family, in which there is a Chain of Interests carried on after the fol∣lowing Manner: The Steward, who is an old Servant, and has cheated his Master Time out of Mind, has the entire Government of him. The Housekeeper has a Hank, as they call it, over the Steward, and makes sin∣gular Use of him in all impertinent Affairs.
<PB N="199" REF="202"/>
The Page has no less Interest in the House∣keeper, at the same Time that he is himself in Love with the Chambermaid. <HI>Rose,</HI> for that is her Name, professes a Passion for <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> the Footman, who is deeply smitten with dirty <HI>Moll</HI> the Kitchen Wench. The latter of these has in Conclusion a great Sway in what∣ever Cases she thinks fit to exert her Inte∣rest, which, if she were made sensible of it, would undoubtedly afford her no small Com∣fort under the constant Hurry and Fatigue of her painful Occupation.'</Q></P>
<P>Having but little Knowledge of great Fami∣lies, I was not before aware that this Scheme of Government was received amongst them; but in the Compass of my own Acquaintance I have seldom seen it otherwise. Old Major <HI>Matchlock,</HI> I remember, was a very blustering Fellow over a Bottle, and withal made a good terrible Figure at the Head of a Company; but within his own Doors he behaved himself with great Pusillanimity, and paid the utmost Subjection to an ancient Maid, whom in less than Forty Years he had raised from raking in a Heap of Cinders, to the Superintendancy over all his domestick Affairs. I am not in my own Nature much addicted to Fear, yet I can∣not but confess that I stand in Awe of my old Servant <HI>Mary.</HI> She happens to be of a mild Disposition, which makes her Authority fit the more easy upon me; but if it were otherwise, I do not presume that I should have Courage enough to make Head against her. As she has few other Favourites or Companions than my Dog and tabby Cat, there is no Danger of her leading me into any Absurdities on their Behalf.</P>

<P>THere is nothing more shocking to a gene∣rous Mind, than to see his Labours ren∣dered vain and fruitless. I once flattered my self with the happy Effects of my Censorship, and thought the Influence of <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> had so generally obtain'd through the United Kingdoms of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that there was no∣thing remaining but the Fruits and Glory of the Conquest. But such is the Misfortune of a publick Character! I have no sooner routed and disarmed the Enemy in one Quarter of my Dominions, exposed the Vice and Folly of Mankind in one Particular, but I find my self engaged in a fresh Dispute; as if my Authori∣ty was not so universally received as I imagin'd, as if the People of this Island thought me only <HI>de Facto,</HI> and not <HI>de Jure,</HI> Censor. By my Age and Experience I have hitherto put a Stop to the growing Evil: But there is a Race of Creatures sprung up (by their Frame and Com∣plexion resembling Men) which are as far above my Understanding, as they are real Objects of my Concern. It grieves me to see the Bull,
<PB N="203" REF="206"/>
the Bear, the Lion, stalking in a humane Form. I am in Pain to find something so like my self sending forth nothing but <HI>Brutal</HI> Ac∣cents, as if all Joy and Grief consisted in the Quantity of Sound, and there was no Way to express the Dictates and Sentiments of Nature but by being tumultuous. These Men, if I may be allowed to call them so, seem weary of being at the Fag-End of the Rational Species, and think they shall make tolerable good Fi∣gures under another Character. I will refer the Examination of this Particular to another Paper, and insert the Letter which gave Occa∣sion to the Reflection.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMong the many Benefits which Mankind has received from your Lucubrations, that of improving and polishing our Conver∣sation has been none of the least. Your di∣stinguishing the different Characters of Men by the Instruments of Harmony, has given most an Inclination to be musical; each pre∣paring and hoping to appear in a better Class. This innocent Ambition has had an Effect even on the lowest Kind, and I have known some Drums, despairing of ever getting a fi∣ner Note, content to be silent; a great Ne∣gative Blessing to those unhappy Gentlemen who were sometimes condemned to be Part of their Audience! But, Sir, there is Need of a farther Reformation, there are some People who have formed to themselves a Sound that comes under no Denomination you have yet imparted to the World; indeed there are not many of this Sect, nor should I
<PB N="204" REF="207"/>
take any Notice of them, but that I have ve∣ry lately observed they begin to get Con∣verts. These noisy Men have their Fits come upon them very constantly, and with very little Intermission, yet they can be sometimes articulate; but then I don't observe those Tokens of Mirth which they show at the End of the Paroxism. I have seen one of them jump out of his Chair, and suddenly getting his Legs from the Ground five or six Times, make such a Noise as Nature gave us not Ears to receive, which has ended in about Seven Minutes in a strong loud Laugh, ac∣companied with the rest of the Sect, if there be any present, (for the Fit often takes 'em a∣mong Strangers) who join in the Chorus. I have seen your great Masters of Noise, Fox∣hunters, Bombardiers, Gunners of all Kinds, Sailers, who are Judges of Storms, amazed at their prodigious Vociferation. I should take them to be something Enthusiastical, but there is no Shew of Religion among them. The <HI>Hottentotts,</HI> (a <HI>Free People</HI>) as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Travellers tell us, come near them in Sound, but with less Impetuosity. From their Agi∣tation they may pass for <HI>French</HI> Prophets, but I think they deserve neither <HI>Toleration</HI> nor <HI>Indulgence.</HI> There have been Arguments us'd by Men of Wit, and God knows of Probity, to support all the Follies that have appeared in the World. Mr. <HI>Herbert, an old solemn Bard of our own,</HI> a Defender of Joking to the last Extent, has observed, <HI>That every Thing is big with Jest, and has Wit in it, if you can find it out.</HI> I neither doubt your Power Phy∣sically, Astrologically, or Mathematically; yet if you can reduce these Sounds into any Compass, if you can form any Figure to ex∣press something inarticulate, though the Dis∣quisition
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>
may not entertain the Multitude, do the fair Thing, and forgive a Friend, who begs of you even to make our Monsters agree∣able.</P>

<P>I AM oblig'd to visit my old Friend <HI>Hortensius</HI> every <HI>April,</HI> when his <HI>Auricula</HI>'s are in Blos∣som. He tells me, he should be as much dis∣appointed if his Friends did not come and see him while his Garden is in its Pride, as a fine Lady would be on her Day, if no Body came to admire how well she was lighted up.</P>
<P>I went down on <HI>Monday</HI> last to his House. It was almost dark when I arrived, and I found my Friend watering his Pots with his own Hand, and covering the choicest of them with Glasses, lest the Inclemency of one Frosty Night, in so uncertain a Climate as ours is, should shorten the Duration of a Pleasure which is but too Transitory even in its longest Continuance. He bid me welcome to his Her∣mitage, and conducted me with <HI>Aude, Hospes, contemnere Opes,</HI> to an elegant little Supper, a good Part of which was the Product of his Garden. After the Cloth was taken away, <Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> said he, I fancy you look with a good deal of Contempt upon our Country Amusements: Is it not very odd to find me doing the same Thing to Night, that
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
I did Forty Years ago? Not at all, replied I, I don't think Individuals either grow better or worse after One and Twenty; and I am no more surprized to find you diverted with an agree∣able innocent Employment Forty Years toge∣ther, than I should be Forty Years hence (if it were possible I could live so long) to find those who are now young Fops to be grown old ones, or those that are young Knaves to be grown more experienc'd: For since People don't grow weary of their Faults, I see no Reason why they should grow weary of their Pleasures, at least of such Pleasures as don't grow weary of them. Ah! dear <HI>Isaac,</HI> said my Friend, there's the Point, to find out some Entertainment that will not find out that we grow old, and such a one I believe I have made Choice of. By that Means I converse daily with the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wdiest Part of the Creation; for since there is no Body here to tell it again to the Toasts, I must own to you, that I think Nature has been no where so la∣vish of her Beauties, as amongst the Birds and Flowers. Harmonious Voices, sweet Breaths, fine Complexions, blooming Youth, and then for Constancy, (one of my poor Turtles is dying of a Widowhood) Where will you match me these in the rest of the World? You durst not talk at that Rate, re∣ply'd I, nor I hear you, but at the Age of Se∣venty, though it is natural for every one to give as much Dignity as he can to whatever he is fond of. Dignity! interrupted <HI>Horten∣sius</HI> a little warmly, we want no Dignity, or at least we need not strain a Point for it. Pray, Friend <HI>Isaac,</HI> when Man was made lit∣tle lower than the Angels, what was he? A Prince, a General, or a Great Minister? Nei∣ther. He was a Gardiner. Pray what is it
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
that distinguishes Man from Beasts? Why all Philosophers say, Reason. Philosophers are Puppies; if Man were distinguished from the rest of the Creation by Reason, would he not be distinguish'd by the noblest Operation of Reason; the cultivating a virtuous Mind? But how is that? Ask any of these Philoso∣phers for Examples of Cruelty, Lust, of Avarice, of Disobedience to Parents, of Ra∣pine, of Ambition, of Treachery, of Cow∣ardice, of any Vice they shall bring you Instances of all these from Kings, Queens, Generals, Popes, and even Philosophers them∣selves: But talk to them of Fidelity, they quote you the Dog; of Piety to Parents, the Stork; of Industry, the Ant and the Bee; of Meekness, the Lamb; of Courage, the Lion; and of Constancy, there my poor Turtle comes in again. Oh! Reason is a dainty Thing; I love that noble Distinction mightily: 'Tis almost as good as Risibility. Hold, dear <HI>Hortensius,</HI> said I, pray let us be distinguished some Way or other, or let us go naked as they do, and save Taylors Bills; or rather let us get Hair and Feathers on our Skins, for I doubt I should not like to walk about pull'd neither."</Q> He smiled upon me, and went on, <Q REND="inline">"I design to distinguish for you too: The true Distinction between Man and Beast, and which <HI>soli Homini convenit</HI> is Gar∣dening. <HI>Homo est Animal Horticolum:</HI> Upon that Condition you may differ from Beasts as much as you please, and be as distinct a Spe∣cies as you can. But if you design to take the Advantage of this Proposal, you must be∣gin by going to Bed early, that we may be up to Morrow to enjoy the Sweets of the Mor∣ning, and therefore I'll wait on you to your Chamber."</Q> The next Morning was so like
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>
one in a Romance, that if it would not make this Paper too long, I could be content to de∣scribe it: About Seven a Clock my Friend came into my Chamber, and told me I was going to be very Happy as soon as I had drank my Cho∣colate, for every Thing conspired to make our Walk so pleasant, that, what with the Perfume of the Flowers, and the Harmony of the Birds, he questioned whether I would regret either the Smoak or the Noises of <HI>London.</HI> There were Two Parterres on either Side of the House, which were separated by a neat Espa∣lier from the rest of the Garden. These were destined for the Reception of the Flowers of Quality, such as <HI>Auricula's, Tulips, Anemonies, Ranunculus's,</HI> and <HI>Carnations,</HI> who lived here removed from the Commerce of the People of Flowers which inhabit the Remainder of this vegetable Kingdom. My Friend was pleased to see me surprized with the Beauties of his Benches of <HI>Auricula's.</HI> He made me take par∣ticular Notice of Number I. which he told me was honoured with the Name of a Great Prin∣cess, and the rest of the Confederacy stood in their proper Places after her. The next Series my Friend enlarged more upon, finding I be∣gun to tast the Entertainment, and made me remark a Flower which was a little overblown; but he told me it had been wonderfully fine in its Time, and whispered me in the Ear the La∣dy's Name it went by: <Q REND="inline">"And what I value it for exceedingly, said he, is, That I have rai∣sed those Four Seedlings which stand next her from this Flower. There was a Fifth, but I could not preserve it: If we had not such Losses, we should be too happy."</Q> In short, he went on with above Fifty fine Ladies one after another, and I believe would never have given off if I had not interrupted him,
<PB N="210" REF="213"/>
by asking him how his Flowers came to be all of a Party, and saying that I did not think to have seen that Matter carried so far. <Q REND="inline">"Why, said he, I don't know how that comes about, but we endeavour to fit our Flowers to our Faces and Characters, and this is done in a Manner by Election: But no Body need be without their Flower, for the <HI>Daffodil</HI> and <HI>Piony</HI> Kind stand empty for any Ladies that please to take them; and as any new ones come out a∣mongst our better Flowers, if they will stand Candidates for them, I shall be very im∣partial. But we can't do so well by the Ge∣nerals; they must have a Campagne in their Bellies, and can't be provided for till next Spring, and then they'll stand as fair as o∣thers."</Q> We took our Walk on through the rest of the Garden, at the lower End of which there was a little Trout Stream, with Benches by the Side of it. Here we sate down, and <HI>Hortensius</HI> asked me if I was not tired with such a sauntering Country Life. I assured him no, and wished I had it in my Power to invite him to such another Place. <Q REND="inline">"Why really my Friend, said he, I passed a good Part of my Time in what the World calls Pursuit of Plea∣sure and Honour, and have found at last, that all those Things are nothing more than what I have in this little Brook,</Q> Noise and Motion.'</P>

<P>I WENT Two or Three Nights ago to <HI>Brown</HI>'s Coffee-house to smoak a Pipe, and talk of the Affairs of <HI>Germany,</HI> with my old Friend Mr. <HI>Solomon Million.</HI> As we were dis∣coursing of Funds and Politicks, I observed a tall genteel Man come in, who made a very re∣spectful Bow to <HI>Million,</HI> and stood at a Distance, but looked as if he had something to say to him.

<HEAD>To all Lovers and others within the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> and the Liberties thereof.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas there have been great Com∣plaints at all Times of the Inconstan∣cies, Indiscretions, Inabilities, and Exorbi∣tances of the several Lovers within the Bills of Mortality, and whereas the same do still continue, notwithstanding the several Statutes in those Cases had, made and provided, so that often those who have gone to Bed in a substantial, happy and reputable Condition, have perhaps the next Morning, by some sud∣den unforeseen Accident, found themselves stripped of all that was near and dear to them, their Pleasure and Reputation: For the preventing of which fatal Misfortunes for the future, it is humbly proposed, That as <HI>Office of Insurance for Lovers</HI> be erected, after the Manner of the <HI>Amicable Society;</HI> where all Persons subscribing the Policies, (which will be ready by the First of <HI>May</HI> next, at which Time the Books will likewise be open∣ed at the Sign of the <HI>United Hearts</HI> in St. <HI>Martin's-Lane</HI>) may be entitled to the following Advantages:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="213" REF="216"/>
I. Any Lover may be insured <HI>ad Val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rem</HI> for any Term of Years, or for Life, if re∣quired, for a reasonable <HI>Praemium,</HI> to be set∣tled by the Majority of the Subscribers at their First General Court, which is to be held as soon as One hundred thousand of ei∣ther Sex have entered themselves of this So∣ciety, which, it is humbly presumed, may be in less than Twenty four Hours after the Books are opened.</P>
<P N="2">II. After such Subscription, and the Name entered in the Company's Books, the Per∣sons who take a Policy, will be insured by the Sum of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> That their Lover shall neither deceive, forsake, nor be∣tray them; and in case of Decay in Af∣fection, which 'tis hoped will seldom hap∣pen, such Losses shall be made good by all the Members of this Society, who, upon due Notice, are to pay in their Quota to any such Claim within Eight Days at far∣thest.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Society will stand to all Repairs of the Persons subscribing they having in Pay the best Artists of all Kinds for that Purpose, some of whom have been bred up at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and procured the most valuable Cosmeticks there at a vast Expence; by which Means they will be able at a Minute's Warning, and in Two Hours Time, to scaffold up and new Point any La∣dy that apprehends falling to sudden Decay, and make her tenantable without Loss of Time, or Hindrance of Business.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="214" REF="217"/>
IV. Young Men of Quality, and Offi∣cers of the Army, must be insured at pret∣ty high Rates, they being liable to Brag∣ging and Inconstancy; but Citizens. Sea∣men, and Country Gentlemen, will come at little or nothing.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Pleasures and Profits of this So∣ciety to be equally divided betwixt the Ad∣venturers.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Any married Woman shall in this Of∣fice be deemed and taken as a Femme Sole, and may subscribe and enjoy to her own Use and Behoof such Policy or Policies, not∣withstanding her Coverture; and in case of any Trouble from her Husband, or if any Divorce should be attempted, the whole So∣ciety are obliged to use their Interest against it, either in the Commons, or otherwise.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Any Adventurers in this Society, may by mutual Agreement, with the Consent of the Governor and Governess, and the Majo∣rity of the Four and twenty Directors, trans∣fer their Right and Title in any Policy to any other Member of this Society.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. All Persons, at their Admission, to take an Oath to stand by and mutually assist each other against all malicious and censo∣rious Tongues, who are always raising ill Reports, and misconstruing the most inno∣cent Looks, to the great Disquiet of civil Families.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="215" REF="218"/>
IX. There are to be Sworn-Appraisers of both Sexes, who are to take a Survey, and certify upon Oath, the true Values of the Persons subscribing.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>Though I am far from taking this for a per∣fect Scheme, yet I think it does not deserve to be rejected at the first Reading; for perhaps something may be added in a Committee to make it of great Use.</P>
<P>I do therefore refer it to a Committee of the whole Town, who are to examine the Allega∣tions, and report their Opinion; for I cannot but think that if something of this Kind could be done, it would be of universal Advantage, and might go a great Way towards extinguish∣ing those Heats and Animosities which are amongst us, and put an affectual Stop to those wicked Emissaries that are continually busied in stirring up Jealousies and evil Reports among Her Majesty's loving Subjects.</P>

<P>ONE great Inducement to me in removing to this End of the Town, was for the Benefit of the Air in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> where I usually take one Turn in the Morning, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it be any Thing like Weather, another as soon as my Pipe is done after Dinner. In my Walk the other Day I met with so odd an Adventure, that I can't help being particular in the Relation of it; especially since, in Regard to Posterity, it may serve to clear up one of the most impor∣tant Passages of my Life. Just by the <HI>Cock-Pit,</HI> at the <HI>Privy-Garden</HI> Door, there step'd up gently to me an ancientish Woman, in a little black Hood, a Whisk Band, and a Crape Gown, and in a soft low Voice calls to me, "<HI>Sir.</HI> I could never think it Charity to relieve your Street-Beggars: What little I do in that Kind, is chiefly to Charity-Schools, and decayed House∣keepers. So on I walk'd, and she after me. <Q REND="inline">'But, Sir, says she again with a respectful Whisper, I am a Gentlewoman. Gentle or Simple, said I, that's nothing to me; Prithee,
<PB N="217" REF="220"/>
Woman, be gone about thy Business: This is not a Place for you."</Q> When she had got me to answer her, she proceeds, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you look like a Gentleman; and my Case is really such, that if you knew but Half—I don't de∣sire to know a Quarter,"</Q> said I. But the Wo∣man was so very civil, and withal so very im∣portunate, that I could not help turning about to her; and with that she pulls Two or Three dirty torn Papers out of her Stays, and offers them me to read. <Q REND="inline">"Pray Mistress, said I, what is it you would have of me? This is not a Place to read Papers in: But my Name is so, I live in such a Place, and if you think it worth your while to come to me when I have more Leisure, I'll hear what you have to say.'</Q> I observed she changed Colour upon hearing my Name, and coming up closer to me, told me, <Q REND="inline">"Nothing but the greatest Necessity could have brought her to this: Her Education, it was well known, had been above any such Thing, till the Frowns of Fortune had redu∣ced her to this Condition. Why it is a strange Thing, said I, Mistress, that you won't take an Answer. I tell you again that I have not for you, and let that suffice. Ah! dear Sir, said she, there was a Time when one of your Name would have given me a kinder Answer."</Q> This brought a Thousand confu∣sed Imaginations into my Head, and I felt something awakening within me that I could not account for. I stole a Look over my Shoul∣der, and saw her wiping a Pair of Eyes, that I thought I should not be a Stranger to, with a greasy Glove, and the Lappet of her Hood. <Q REND="inline">'I have no small Money about me, said I, but I'm just at Home, and made what Haste I could to my House."</Q> As I was going into my Parlour, I heard my Maid disputing the Door
<PB N="218" REF="221"/>
with her. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mary,</HI> said I, let the Gentlewo¦man come in."</Q> As soon as we were alone, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fix'd my Eye upon her, and ask'd her, <Q REND="inline">"Pray what may your Name be? Ah! Mr. <HI>Bicker∣staff,</HI> she replied, Is it possible you should have forgot me? But indeed the Troubles I have gone thro' since you and I danced toge∣ther at the Mayor's Feast at <HI>Litchfield,</HI> would have altered a better Face than I could ever pretend to. Whatever Changes Time and Trouble may have made in you, said I, I'm sure it has not made so much in me, but that I am mightily concerned to know what has happened to you, since I am now assured you can be no other than Mrs. <HI>Olivia Darkin,</HI> for whom once I pass'd so many uneasy Mi∣nutes. Well, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> I must own—But pray sit down, said I—And <HI>Mary,</HI> D'ye hear? Bring me a Pint of that Sack in the Corner, and bake a Toast. Well, pray go on. Why truly, Sir, as I was saying, I did perceive you had a Kindness for me; but alas! What could you expect of a giddy∣headed young Thing as I was in those Days? For you must know, Sir, that Mr. <HI>Mac-Carrot,</HI> that you saw at our House, had engaged my Affections before I came from the Boarding-School; but I am sure I have lived to repent it every Vein of my Heart that ever I cross'd the Seas with him. In short, Sir, we were no sooner married, but he carried me over with him to the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> where he had Relations who were well enough to pass, and what with their Assistance, and that little we had of our own, we made a pretty good Shift for some Years, 'till the War breaking out in <HI>Ireland,</HI> my Husband was too zealous for the Popish Interest, and entered into the Service of the late K— <HI>J—s.</HI> I told him
<PB N="219" REF="222"/>
over and over what would come of it. He gave me no Answer, but that it was his Opi∣nion, and he would stand and fall by it; and Child, said he, you are a Fool if you don't turn Catholick. Never talk on it, said I, I'll die a Thousand Deaths before I'll change my Religion, and so he never press'd me any more about it. But as I had foretold, so it happened, he was killed at the Siege of <HI>Li∣merick,</HI> and our House plundered; I may safely say they did not leave me the Value of this Rag to wind about my Finger."</Q> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>en she burst out a Crying. <Q REND="inline">"Ha! said I, this is a melancholy Story indeed; come, here's to you, I'll promise you 'tis a Glass of good Sack: But pray did his Relations do nothing for you? Relations! Ah Lord! said she, they were his Relations, not mine; and when he went, all went with him: You must think, Sir, I went to 'em, but they looked as coldly upon me as if I came to take the Bread out of their Mouths. At last, they agreed among 'em to take one of my Girls off my Hands, and gave me Five Pounds to carry me over to <HI>England.</HI> But when I came there, I was never the near, for I had anger'd all my Friends in Marrying; and I dare say some of 'em were glad to see me in such Necessity. At last an Aunt of mine sent me Word I should be welcome to her in <HI>Staf∣fordshire,</HI> where, being a Widow, and old and infirm, I was serviceable to her in the Nature of her House-keeper. It pleased God she died in about Two Years after, and left me in Money and Goods to the Value of Four hundred Pounds. Upon this I pluck'd up a good Heart again, and had several Of∣fers made me from substantial Farmers of good Repute in the Neighbourhood; but it
<PB N="220" REF="223"/>
was a Sort of Life I did not care for, and having no Thoughts of altering my Condi∣tion, nothing would serve me but I must come up to Town here; and having a Stock of Linen, and other good Things that my Aunt left me, I hired a handsome House, and took Lodgers. Well, why this put you in a good Way again, said I, interrupting her. Yes indeed, Sir, said she, I had several Par∣liament-Men and other very good Gentlemen in my House, and lived as creditably as any Body in my Employ; so that in a few Years I thought I should be able to do very well for my Children. Pray what Children might you have, said I, besides the <HI>Girl</HI> you were mentioning in <HI>Ireland.</HI> I had a Son and Daughter, said she, and as hopeful they were, though I say it, as any Woman would wish to be Mother of. But there was a Gen∣tleman in my House who belonged to the Army, a civil Man to my thinking, as ever came under any Body's Roof. I never heard an Oath come out of his Mouth, he paid me punctually every <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, and was so easy and contented, that I thought I could never do enough for him. It seems, as I found afterwards, he took a Liking to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Betty;</HI> and I believe there was no Love lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> for I observed the Girl would go mopin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about the House, and I would often s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> to her, What's come to you, Child?

<PB N="221" REF="224"/>
and as soon as she was up, Well, Mother, says she, I will not live here to be a Disgrace to you, I'll try my Fortune in the <HI>Indies.</HI> So I agreed with a <HI>West-India</HI> Captain of my Acquaintance, since the Girl had such a Mind to travel into foreign Parts; but the first News I had by the Return of the Ships was, that she died of the Distemper of the Coun∣try. Still I was in Hopes my Son <HI>Joseph</HI> would do well; but he was got in with an idle Gang, who would send for him at all Hours in the Night. I was fond of him, and sed him with Money till I was almost redu∣ced again, in Hopes to reclaim him by fair Means: At other Times I would talk to him seriously, and tell him he had had another Sort of an Education: But nothing would do; I found I was but a Woman; he would give me the Hearing, and then away to his Comrades. But one Day above the rest, there was a great Noise of a Robbery and Murder that had been committed upon <HI>Bagshot-Heath,</HI> and my Son, among others, was taken up and carried to <HI>Newgate.</HI> Upon his Tryal, he confessed he was among them, and was found guilty; but he declared with his last Breath, he was not concerned in the Murder. I was with him every Day after his Condem∣nation. He told me all along he was willing to die; but I did what I could with Money and Friends, till I had nothing left, to get his Pardon; and a Gentleman who belonged to the Court, and had formerly been my Lodger, gave me Hopes to the last, and bid me fear nothing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that my Son should not suffer. To keep him in Heart, I told him we should get a Reprieve: But when he found he must go into the Cart, he fixed his Eyes stedfastly upon me, and only said, Mo∣ther,
<PB N="222" REF="225"/>
is it come to this? I repented afterwards that I had deluded my poor Child with vain Promises; for he relied so much upon them, that I am afraid he did not make so good an End as he should have done. It was a bad End indeed, said I, for an only Son; but Children, you know, are certain Troubles, and uncertain Comforts: However, what's past can't be recalled. I am sorry for your Misfortunes; but pray tell me, Do you want any little Assistance that I can give you? Sir, said she, I'll conceal nothing from you; I want for nothing: I have between Six and Seven Hundred Pounds by me, which I have pick'd up in this Way, and hope that will put me above Dependance for the rest of my Life."</Q> I drank again to her to renew our old Acquaintance, and so we parted. She left me so full of Reflections upon the Escape I had had when I would have married her, that I could not sleep a Wink that Night.</P>

<P>EVER since I have taken upon me the Of∣fice of Censor of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it has been my principal Care to guard my self against all Manner of just Reproaches, which might depretiate those wholesome Maxims which I every Day distribute to the Publick, and to fence against all those Vices which render old Age contemptible. And 'tis wholly owing to this that I have never fallen into that common Weakness of finding Fault with the present only for an Excuse to cry up the last Age. I must own I have had a great Itch to do it, but as I weigh every Thing before I attempt doing it, I find upon mature Deliberation, that ge∣nerally

speaking the Age is virtuously inclined, and that what Faults it has proceed chiefly from excellent Principles, and might be made Virtues with a very little Trouble. For, in the first Place, I observe that Part of Mankind, where one would least expect it, to be wonder∣fully inclined to Oeconomy; I mean the Young and the Fair of Quality. No Frost, Snow, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> East Wind, can hinder a large Set of People from going to the Park in <HI>February,</HI> no Dust nor Heat in <HI>June.</HI> And this is come to such an intrepid Regularity, that those a∣greeable Creatures that would shriek at an hind Wheel in a deep Gutter, are not afraid, in their proper Sphere, of the Disorder and Danger of Seven Rings. But as the City does generally value it self upon out-doing t'other End of the Town in these Matters, so I have long observed, with infinite Satisfaction, a certain Coach, which I esteem particularly. It belongs to a worthy Trader in or near <HI>Well-Close,</HI> and no Disparagement to <HI>Charles</HI>'s-<HI>Wain,</HI> it keeps its Course as regularly as any Fix'd Star of 'em all. The Family to which this wondrous Automaton belongs, goes to Dinner as soon as Morning Service is over, they set out in the Cool of the Noon, about Half an Hour after Twelve, and, according to the Rule of discreet Travellers, make the Coachman drive slowly at first, by which they have Two Ad∣vantages; one, that they see all the Company go to Church in the City, and the other, that their Horses have Time to empty themselves. At <HI>Charing-Cross</HI> they stop and give the Cattel a Mouthful of Hay, have a cool Tankard, or the like, and any of the Gentlewomen that have Occasion step out of the Coach. By the End of <HI>Suffolk-street</HI> they mend their Pace, and
<PB N="225" REF="228"/>
get into a tolerable Trot, which brings them so happily to the farthest Part of their Journey, and in such good Time, that they are there as soon as the best of 'em. I remember last Year I was over-against <HI>Northumberland</HI> House when this Caravan reposed there; they were Five of the Fair Sex, Three pretty fat ones, one very fat, and a lean one. They were all sure of the Thousand Pounds a Year in the Lottery, and almost fell out about their several Ways of Dis∣posing of it. The fattest of them said, <Q REND="inline">"If it should please God to take away her Master, she would not change her Condition tho' she should get the Thousand Pounds a Year, but would lay it up to make her Children love her; but if they should prove undutiful, she could not tell how far she might be prevailed upon; but an't please God she'd never mar∣ry a Seaman again, she'd have no more Frights and Twitters at every puff of Wind."</Q> The next in Size to her Ladiship said, <Q REND="inline">"Laud Mother, Why to be sure, Forsooth, you won't have it; you'll have enough without it. Child, said her Mother, Will you never leave off that ugly Trick? Can't you call a Body, Madam? I wou'd to God I had sent you to <HI>Chelsey</HI> instead of <HI>Stepney,</HI> but 'twas such a great Way off. Prithee, Sister, don't fright your self, says another, I shall have it mun; for I was adreamed, and so methought there came a fine Gentleman to me, in a Cinnamon-colour'd Coat and Gold Buttons, and a long Wig, and a Gold Chain about his Neck, and so he ax'd me to go with him to his Country-House at <HI>Grinitch,</HI> and methought he had my Lord Mayor's Bage and Tisdale, and the City Musick, and he said as how 'twas because I had a great Forti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
<PB N="226" REF="229"/>
The Third said, she was sure she should have it, because she had a Mind to it; and if she got it, she'd come away immediately to that very Coffee-house yonder, and send for one of those young Officers out, and marry him immediately; and then, Madam, I'll come and wait upon you in my Glass Chariot, and pass my Time like a little Queen. Ah, <HI>Mal!</HI> said the old one, thou art a mad Girl; thou'dst think on't twice—Ay so I shall Forty Times, said she; till the Lottery is drawn, I shall do nothing but think on't: But Sister <HI>Rachel</HI> says nothing. Why, says the lean one, I'm satisfied none of you will have it, for 'tis come into my Head just now that I shall have it my self; and I'll take a House in <HI>Devonshire-Square,</HI> and get a Set to play all Day long at <HI>Lue,</HI> and never marry, but despise Mankind; though now I think on't, if any of you have a Girl to my Mind, per∣haps I may breed her up, and when I die, leave her all I have, and then she may be married to a Lord: Look'ee there now."</Q> It grieved me mightily to see the Coach drive a∣way at this Period, and I could not but make this Reflection: How Five People could be sanguine enough to expect the great Lot, which was One hundred and fifty thousand to One whether either of them had it, and of the many Thousand Owners of Coaches in and about this great City, not one of them was afraid of having their Necks broke at the <HI>Park,</HI> where the Odds are not above Two hundred at most; nay, Folks are glad to borrow a Chance for being crippled. I concluded with my self, that those who come from the wary Part of the Town, had perhaps had the Precau∣tion to insure in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> without which
<PB N="227" REF="230"/>
I thought it impossible Ladies should venture to travel so far to run such Dangers; for we may perceive by the Number of Offices now in Town, that it is no longer in Fashion to ride Post to Sieges: But the Mystery was soon explained as to these <HI>Well-Close</HI> Pilgrims; for that very Evening my honest Friend <HI>Faber</HI> would needs take me from St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park</HI> with him to eat a cold Chicken and Sallad, and drink a Flask of <HI>Flurrence,</HI> as he calls it; and as we were looking out at Window in the <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> and seeing the Coaches going to the <HI>Park,</HI> I saw my Lady and her Daughters re∣turn. I had an Inclination to smile at first; but upon Reflection, I could not but admire the Sagacity of those People, who (having a great Way to go) come out of the <HI>Park</HI> when others are going in, for by that Means they see all the Company, and avoid all the Danger.</P>

<P>I Cannot without Admiration behold the forward Pretensions of the Youth of this Age, wherein we daily find Boys exerting the very first Operations of their Minds in the most abstruse Parts of Learning; so that one would th nk the Souls of their Great Grandfathers had transmigrated into them. This praecoci∣ous Wit, as it is very unbecoming in the Pre∣sence of a Man of my Years, so is it likewise very ominous to the Persons who are possessed with it; for they are generally short-liv'd, and give Occasion to their Mothers to say, The poor Child had too much Sense to live long. It is therefore my Opinion, That this great Vice takes its Beginning entirely from taking Chil∣dren too soon f om the Breast, and admitting them so early to the Use of a luxurious Variety in their Food, which forces an Understanding before its due Time. I have therefore, from a
<PB N="229" REF="232"/>
long Observation amongst young Fellows, as I find them in their Conversation, and according to the Subjects which they handle, been able to tell the very Day when the Nurse applied the bitter Drug to the Nipple, to give them an Aversion to Sucking. There was a Law among that wise People the <HI>Romans,</HI> That no Man should kill above Thirty Asses at a Time for a Banquet; and the Reason was, that they being a Creature then esteemed a great Dainty, and a vast Consumption of them, there was found at length a great Defect of their Milk for the Education of the Offspring of the Common∣wealth, to the unspeakable Pain and Labour of the good Women, who were otherwise obli∣ged to suckle their Children till they should be fit to carry Arms in Defence of their Coun∣try. I have therefore, out of a due Respect to such an excellent Example, and to prevent the Inconveniencies of these too early Essays in Things of sublime Science, ordered the inge∣nious Mr. <HI>Charles Bubbleboy</HI> to get made for the Use of the Publick, from Time to Time, a sufficient Number of Sucking-Bottles, which all young Fellows under the Age of Twenty are to hang with a Chain about their Necks. And I likewise ordain, That when any Person under the Age above written shall presume to launch out of his Depth in Theoretical Learn∣ing, it shall be in the Power of any By-stander to apply the Bottle to his Mouth, and make him suck.</P>
<P>I hope by this Simplicity of Diet in some reasonable Time so far to reform the Manners of Youth in Conversation, that no one under the Age aforementioned shall presume to ex∣ceed the Limits of Grammatical Learning in Discourse; and likewise to augment the
<PB N="230" REF="233"/>
Strength and Stature of my Countrymen, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well as their Understandings.</P>
<P>It has ever been the Custom of our Family to bring up their Children without endeavou∣ring to improve their Minds till their Bodies were grown to a full Maturity, and we were suffered as it were to lie fallow without any Cultivation, till the Soil was rich enough to give a full Vigour and Extension to the Seed that should be sown in it. For this Reason I was looked upon as a meer Idiot all the Time of my Childhood, and lived in a State of Ad∣miration to an Age wherein others are wont to exert egregious Signs of Wisdom. I remember very well, that I sucked my Mother till I was able to carry my Cradle on my Back, and could not speak a Word till I was Ten Years old, being a perfect <HI>Pythagorean</HI> by Nature, and always more inclinable to hear than talk, till I grew so full of Conceptions, that at last I was obli∣ged to give Vent by Writing, as my Thoughts oppress'd me, the Delivery of which hath had that wonderful Effect as to make me arrive at the Dignity of being Censor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>

<P>MY Curiosity led me the other Day to be present at the Election at <HI>Westminster</HI> School, where I met with an Entertainment of Juvenile Exercises suitable to my Expecta∣tion, and observed with great Satisfaction those pretty Velitations of Wit, which may be called the politer Parts of Grammatical Learning, and are the promising Preludes of future Perfections in the sublime Sciences. Those little Epigram∣matical Flowers, in which you behold Poetry in her Spring, very various in her Array of Co∣lours, but not daring yet to shoot high from the Earth, which were then offered up as Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Fruits to the Great <HI>Harlaeus,</HI> as they shew their own Inability of soaring high enough, yet they do in some Measure point at that immense Heighth of Praise, which should be equal to
<PB N="233" REF="236"/>
the Subject commended, and which ought to be the particular Province of an Epick Poet.</P>
<P>When I first entered the School, I was struck with a becoming Awe and Veneration to so sa∣cred a Place, and the Dignity of the Person presiding in it, not without a due Regard to the <HI>Fasces,</HI> which are the Symbol of his Au∣thority. I could not then forbear taking the Person and Office of a Schoolmaster into a nearer Consideration, and to propose him to my Mind in the Abstract, with a View of what he teaches.</P>
<P>A Schoolmaster is a compleat Treasury of chosen Words from Classick Authors, the very Composition of whose Body does not seem to owe it self so much to the Four Physicical Ele∣ments, as to the Four and twenty Letters of the Alphabet; and yet with so little Confusion in his Contexture, that he shall be able, as it were, to unravel his whole Substance into Idi∣oms, Proper Diction, Golden Sentences, Ver∣ses, Themes, and Declamations. You would think the Oeconomy of his House was directed entirely according to the Three Special Rules, and that the Book of Tenses served for a Clock to it. His proper Business is to teach Gram∣mar, which he distributes as sound Aliment to his Scholars, giving every one such a Portion for a Meal, and with that Impartiality, that no one complains of having too little.</P>
<P>Whilst I was amusing my self with these Thoughts, which to some may seem too ludi∣crous on so grave a Subject, (though I profess <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is far from my Intention to lessen the Idea of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o excellent a Function) I was diverted from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther prosecuting the Character, by being obli∣ged

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU were pleased some Time since to make several Parts of Mankind the Instruments of much Mirth to the Town, and to debase humane Nature so low, as to inclose several Persons in Viols and Harpsi∣cords, for no other End but to play upon them. I would be glad one Part of the World could be diverted without the other's paying the Expence of it, and I have such a general Good-Will to every Thing that has Life, that I cannot see any of my Fellow Creatures abused without a very sensible Concern. The ill Usage of Dogs (notwith∣standing their Fidelity, which ought to have gained them the Esteem of all honest Men) is so notorious, that 'tis become a Proverb; and I have long had a Design of vindicating these Animals in a regular Treatise, in which I would oppose them to several Ranks of Men, and impartially examine the Merits on both Sides, and decide according to Justice: But as my Business at present will not permit me to enter into so large a Field as that Disqui∣sition, I have sent you up some Heads,

<P>I observe first, That <HI>Bear-Dogs</HI> are a stay'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sort of grave dull Animals, and I fancy no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much inferior to some Country Justices.</P>
<P><HI>Bull-Dogs,</HI> though they have neither Fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor Wit, yet being apt to fall upon any Thing that's tied to a Stake, and to make their Teeth meet when they have any, might be usefully employed as Exe∣cutioners of Justice against publick Mis∣managers.</P>
<P><HI>French Spaniels,</HI> who generally profess the Doctrine of Passive Obedience, would make as good Courtiers as Setters; for they will lie still while a Net is drawn over them, though they are caught themselves in it, and will not stir, in Hopes of having a dead Bird flung to them to mumble.</P>
<P>There are many Curs of all Denominations, that allow Resistance in the extreamest Necessity: These are called Mad Dogs by the other Whelps, in hopes to get 'em knocked on the Head; but People don't rise upon them, notwithstanding the Out∣cry, because they do not take 'em to be Driv'lers.</P>

<P><HI>Fop-Dogs</HI> are <HI>Italian Greyhounds, Dutch Mastives,</HI> and <HI>Shocks.</HI> These are the Beaux, Smarts, and Dappers.</P>

<P>WHen I was formerly an <HI>Oxford</HI> Scholar, I had the Honour of being Mace-bearer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Club of Ugly Faces for several Years to∣gether; and I remember it was of very great Use to me in those Times, for as I had never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Money in my Pocket to spend, so neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad I any Occasion for it, it being a standing Rule in the Club, always to run away without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying the Reckoning; as it was also, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould never come to the same House twice.

<P>LOng have I laboured, and much have I travelled, for the Improvement of my Fellow-Subjects. I have not been wanting by my Speculations to show the easy and pleasant Ways to Virtue; nor have I been less severe in censuring Vice wherever I met it, which I find every where increase, and come on apace, while Virtue slowly creeps up, meets with continual Opposition, and seldom, very seldom comes to that Perfection as to dare to look Vice in the Face; but then it easily looks such false Courage out of Countenance. It was most amazing to me, when I was Yester∣day at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-house, to see a for∣ward Youth, well dressed and powdered, whom I knew not only to be of very mean Extract, but of more despicable Parts, lay his extraor∣dinary Chin over a Duke's Shoulder, and as familiarly ask him impertinent Questions, as if his Equality or Intimacy entitled him to di∣sturb that noble Peer, who, when he was de∣livered from the Weight of his Chin, enquired who he was. How easy had it been for me to have told the Company, that that Place was
<PB N="246" REF="249"/>
indeed very fit for him, but in another Capaci¦ty? However I only privately informed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Master, who, in Respect to his Brother Coffee¦Man, desired the Count to know himself, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not be so familiar with those that he did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> know. From that Place I came to <HI>Tom</HI>'s at <HI>De¦vereux-Court.</HI> I have a singular Respect for that courteous Man, and find, that if he per∣mits Doctor <HI>Sal-vo</HI>—to lay aside the Man in that violent Man, and with an Indignation (greater than can be admitted to any Orator) retire into the Third Sphere, and talk Things indeed not fit to be heard, I assure my Under-Secretary, that as Curiosity at present doubles his Customers at the Doctor's Eloquence, in a short Time, as no Body else now can be heard, there will be no Body to hear.</P>
<P><HI>Ordered</HI> therefore, That unless the said Do∣ctor will condescend to be on the Level with Common Sense, his Tea be always Two De∣grees under Proof; That he be allowed no Tobacco, nor the Use of his own <HI>S. V. O.</HI> both too conducive to Agitation; but after having paid his Penny, you show him the Situation of your Door.</P>
<P>What made me in some Measure excuse the Doctor's Vociferation was, that I did not see as usual the News-Papers, of which none could give Account, till in about Half an Hour's Time I saw a Man come out of the Yard with a Handful, yet enquiring most thirstily for the <HI>Post-Boy;</HI> till he had that, he would not deliver the rest. Upon Enquiry, I found him to be my old Friend the Upholsterer revi∣ved in a <HI>North-British</HI> Barber, who is so great a Patriot, so good a Politician, so sollicitous for the Grand Alliance in General, and so tender of

<P>DIscouraged and wearied by the ill Success of my Endeavours to reclaim this obsti∣nate Age f om its Vices and Follies, I have of∣ten had it in my Thoughts to quit my Office. My Friends all importune me to it, and one of them, whom in <HI>January</HI> last I had desired to continue this Paper during a necessary Avoca∣tion of mine, actually tried to lay it down handsomly for me. Nothing has hindered me from complying with their Requests, but a strong Benevolence I have always had towards Mankind, and an ardent Desire of doing some Good in my Generation. These alone have supported me under my Disappointment, and now prompt me to put in Execution a new Scheme, which is to abate something from the Grandeur of my Enterprize; and, since I can∣not attain a greater Good, to attempt a less, no longer endeavouring to ease Men of their Fol∣lies, but in their Follies; nor striving to make
<PB N="249" REF="252"/>
Men supportable to each other, but each one to himself. This Thought arose in me the o∣ther Night at the Play, upon observing several Difficulties that many of our Nobility and Gen∣try laboured under. A pretty young Gentle∣man tore his Breeches, and broke his Sword, by getting over the Box into the Pit, that he might have that Opportunity of exposing to Sight his Pearl-coloured Stockings and red-top'd Shoes. Another, who had a very fine Wig, and a Feather in his Hat, was forced to sit covered all the Time, and spoil the Wig to shew the Feather. A Third, lest his fring'd Gloves should not be seen, underwent the Pain of leaning forwards for a whole Play together upon the fore Part of the Box, setting his Arms upright upon his Elbows. A Fourth, who was in low Circumstances of Stature, every now and then with great Labour heaved into Sight a rich Sword-Knot: And many others were variously hamper'd and perplex'd in displaying their several Fineries. To remedy which In∣conveniences, I at first thought it might be pro∣per to advise the Owners of the Play-house to appropriate each Division of the Side-Boxes to a several Dress, and to distinguish them by In∣scriptions over them in large Letters in these and the like Words:<LIST>
<ITEM>Red-top'd Shoes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sword-Knots.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Feathers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fring'd Gloves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Gold Snuff-Boxes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dress'd at all Points.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By which Means the whole Audience would at one Glance be appriz'd of the particular Or∣nament of every Person in that Division.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="253"/>
But reflecting since that this Invention would be of too narrow an Use, (it being likely to ex∣tend only to the Play-house, and perhaps a Ca∣thedral or two) I have applied my self to find out something that may be of general Ease to the Beau Monde; proceeding in this Manner; I considered what might be the Rise or Cause of all that vast Variety of Fashions which we Yearly see. This I found to be solely the Oftentation of Riches; for upon this Accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is, that People have no sooner one Sui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought Home from the Taylor's, but (to shew that their Purse is not exhausted) they bespeak another, which (that it may appear to the most careless Eye to be a late Purchase) must differ from the former, not only in Matter, but in Form. This in the present Course of Things will be an eternal Occasion of the Mutability of Fashions, and as a Man has but one Way of being in the Right, and Ten thousand of be∣ing in the Wrong, so there can be but one Dress commodious, and as soon as we deviate from that, we shall find all the rest trouble∣some. I therefore thought, that if a Medium could be invented by me, whereby both the Fair and the Foul. Sex might at once be rid of the Incumbrances of the Mode, and be conti∣nued in the Reputation of Profuseness, I should do an acceptable Piece of Service to my Country, and procure to my self Peace of Mind in a Consciousness that I had not lived in vain. This I hope I have at last happily ef∣fected by the following Project:</P>
<Q>An Office shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed by the Name of <HI>The Equivalent Office.</HI> In this Office, any Person shall be admitted to pay down such Sum or Sums of Money as he or she shall be desirous to expend in any particular
<PB N="251" REF="254"/>
Orna∣ment or Ornaments. Upon the Payment of such Sum or Sums, and Intimation given what Piece of Finery it is designed for, there shall be made out a neat Ticket or Creden∣tial (in the Language of the Office) to be worn in the most conspicuous Part of the Bo∣dy, certifying to all Men, that the Wearer thereof has actually laid out so much Money as would have purchased such an Ornament therein described, and requiring them to deem, esteem and repute the said Wearer as <HI>ipso facto</HI> wearing the said Ornament, any Thing in outward Appearance to the contrary notwithstanding.</Q>
<P>The Advantages that will arise from this Of∣fice are innumerable. I shall only hint at a few, which will put the Reader into a Way of discovering many more.</P>
<P>By Vertue of proper Credentials, Gentlemen may wear Wigs of such Size and Colour as shall best suit with their Features and Complexions, and yet have the Credit of Light Full-Bottoms. Thick Legs may be diminished by black Stock∣ings, and Spindle-Shanks enlarged by white, yet both be reputed as Scarlet Silk. Corns may be avoided by keeping the Feet in easy old Shoes, and yet the Owner maintain the Reputation of having a new Pair every Day. Ladies, by these Credentials, may yet farther enlarge their Petticoats, which in their present Method is impossible to be done. They may make their Head-Dresses proportionable to their Petticoats, and they may patch their Faces with Diamonds without Disparagement to their Eyes.</P>
<P>I am not insensible how highly beneficial this Scheme might be in raising Money for the
<PB N="252" REF="255"/>
Publick; but a former Project of mine ha∣ving been rejected with Scorn when I offer∣ed it, and Two Years after made Use of with good Success, but without any Acknow∣ledgment of or to the Inventor, I am dis∣gusted from making any more Proposals of that Nature. I had once a Mind to apply the Profits to Charitable Uses; but then I thought again, that doing Good with the Money would be so prodigious an Altera∣tion in the Application of it, that it would create an insuperable. Objection against the whole Undertaking in those who were likely to be my Contributors; so that I have at last resolved to apply it wholly to my own Benefit.</P>

<P>IT is impossible to describe Wit by Generals: We must descend to Particulars, and trace it Part by Part. For Wit is like Beauty: We may admire the Air, the Symmetry, the whole Collection of Charms; but we cannot express it without running over the Lip, the Neck, the Eye, the Breasts, and every individual Fea∣ture. At present I shall examine that Sort of Wit we call <HI>Turns.</HI> These appear to Advan∣tage in some Parts of Poetry, which make their proper Province, but lose their Lustre when misplaced, and have nothing to excuse them, but an unbounded irregular Fancy. The Ornaments of Poetry, like those of Dress, owe their <HI>Ecclat</HI> in a great Measure to their Situa∣tion. A Turn, that would have given Life to an <HI>Epigram,</HI> will make an Image in <HI>Heroicks</HI> particoloured and ridiculous; as the same Jew∣el which adorned the Ear or the Neck, would in the Nose look monstrous and rueful. This
<PB N="254" REF="257"/>
Misapplication then is a Species of False Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> and has a large Share in the Degeneracy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our modern Writers. I should be apt to di¦stinguish the <HI>Muse</HI> that inspired this Sort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wit from the Divine <HI>Calliope,</HI> as I would a <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦quet</HI> from a <HI>Fine Woman:</HI> One is all Air an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Affectation; the other refines upon good Sense<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet converses in proper Words and Sentiments. A Turn is the Creature of Fancy, that after it is born, is put under the Tuition of the Judg∣ment, which is to assign it a proper Station, and to stint its Extravagancies. When it de∣pends upon the Words or Style, great Care is to be used that it may not dwindle into <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> and <HI>Jingle;</HI> and when it consists chiefly in the Thought, the same Diligence is required that it may not sink into any of those <HI>Flowers</HI> of the School, or <HI>Common-Places</HI> of Youth, by which they gradually ascend to this Attainment. Both the <HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Verbal Turn</HI> owe their Beau∣ty to Novelty; for there is no greater Per∣fection in these Witticisms, than what arises from that sudden Surprize they make upon the Imagination. They seem to take their Name from their Nature; for they consist mostly in advancing a Thought or Expression, and then making what follows, play upon it in an agreeable Way, either by retracting what went before, or wittily perverting it, or comparing it with something that hits the same Fact or Idea to any Degree of Exactness, or giving some surprizing Reason for it when it seemed a Paradox. Indeed, the Variety of Turns is so great, and their Beauty so entirely owing to this Variety, that it is almost impossible to fix them to any stated Rules. A <HI>Turn</HI> being the Product of Fancy, it is unnatural to use it but in those gayer and more airy Parts of Poetry, where the Fancy is at Liberty to wanton and
<PB N="255" REF="258"/>
gambol. In the <HI>Epick,</HI> in <HI>Tragedy,</HI> or in that Sort of <HI>Elegy</HI> which has Distress for its Subject, it would be ridiculous and trifling; for here the chief Business belongs to the Judgment, and the Fancy is only concerned in ranging for Images and Ideas equal to the Grandeur of the Subject. A Hero in a Passion, might as well express the high Sentiments of his Soul by laughing at one of the Plumes out of his Hel∣met, as by playing with a Turn or a Double Entendre. A Lover, lamenting the Rigour of his Mistress, or a Poet the Loss of his Friend, in this sportive Way, would make as aukward a Figure as the resigned <HI>Ardelia,</HI> when she laughs at the Mischiefs committed by her Monkey, though the Loss of her <HI>China</HI> wrings her very Soul; or an <HI>Irishman,</HI> in his Country Way, singing at a Funeral. The Ancients had Abundance of this Sort of Wit, and used it more discreetly than the Moderns. The <HI>Greeks</HI> indeed appear perfect Strangers to it: They had other Ways to improve that Mirth which was so natural to them. <HI>Anacreon</HI> and <HI>Aristo∣phanes</HI> write in a Way where <HI>Turns</HI> are a Beau∣ty, and yet it is very difficult to find so much as one Expression of that Sort in their Works. <HI>Homer, Hesiod, Theocritus,</HI> and <HI>Musaeus,</HI> have no∣thing like it in their Poems. It seems to have begun at <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Epigrams</HI> became the common Entertainment of their best People. After Supper, or over a Bottle in a cool Re∣treat, it was their Custom to divert one ano∣ther with reciting or composing three or four <HI>Distichs,</HI> that were usually pointed with one of these Turns, in which they were smart upon some of the reigning Coxcombs, Coquets, or Humours of that Age. Modern Lampoons were introduced as a <HI>Third</HI> Course at the Ta∣bles of great Men in Imitation of this Custom.
<PB N="256" REF="259"/>
A good Part of <HI>Martial</HI>'s Epigrams seem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been made at some of those Conversa¦tions; whence we may account for the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inequality in his Works, which himself ac¦knowledges—<Q><L>Sunt bona, sunt quaedam mediocria, sunt mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plura.</L></Q> For we may imagine, that the <HI>Grave</HI> Pieces were made just upon the Whet, the <HI>Bright</HI> after the first Bottle, and the <HI>Smutty</HI> after a full Dose.

<HEAD>A Lover's Meditation on his Mistress.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hours to me are Ages of Misery; they must be insupportable to a Wretch who can never know what Joy is but in her Presence. Love may well be defined a restless Impatience to be with those we adore. What a miserable Constraint then must I live under, who make it my Business to avoid the Mistress of my Soul? Where my Heart, my Wishes, my Thoughts are eternally, there I must never be. Did she but know what I suffer, and how much a Discretion as exact as mine makes one miserable; but alas! they must love like me that are to guess at my Torments. I hardly know I live, but by what I endure for her. O! Nothing can touch my Soul; there is no Har∣mony
<PB N="259" REF="262"/>
in Words, unless she speaks-them; there is no Bliss, but in her Smile; no Terror, but in her Frown; nothing worth living for, but her Esteem. There is this Comfort in an Af∣fliction like mine, no other Thing can give me a Moment's Uneasiness. She prevents all other Grief, she prevents all other Pleasure. If the whole World should change its Place, and she not concerned, I should hardly perceive it. Whether Peace or War, what Party prevails, whose Ruin is near, all these Things are now indifferent, they employ not my Thoughts. My only Impatience is to increase her good Opinion, my only Care not to forfeit her Esteem. This Thought brings me into one of those terrible Fits of Fear which often seize them that adore her. I know I am not in positive Disobedience; and a little Equivocation, if so much practised in Religion, may be indulged in Love. I nei∣ther write nor send to her; I dare not disobey. Sure if there be any Thing like a Fault in this, I am safe. Who is it is to accuse? Who is guilty? And I hope I may say, What is the Crime? This Letter is sent to you, meant to her, and it came from him; but, Who are these? In this Dress, it is to every Body, it is to no Body. How will you draw up my In∣dictment? However let me not be condemn'd unaccus'd, unheard; save me from being cri∣minal, if you can think me so. Burn this, and there can be but a single Evidence against me, your self; and there never shall be another. This is the plotting Way of your Servant, who with less Fear would engage in Treason than in what might offend her too scrupulous Nice∣ness. I confess I tremble, tho' I can say (if this be one) it is a new Kind of Sin, against which there is no Law.</P>
<P>Her Eyes were not more fatal to me the first Time that I saw them, than my own have been

false to my Heart ever since, if they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> told her a Thousand Times that I die for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Alas! How many Tears will that Happin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> cost them?

The Adoration that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her is such, and no other but what we shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> all pay the Gods were their charming Attri∣butes so visible. I was prepared for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣tal Influence before I saw her Eyes, I was be∣witch'd by her Syren Tongue before I heard it. I lov'd the Spring from whence she came, and my Soul follows the enticing Stream with Plea∣sure. I knew there must be Wit and Fire be∣fore I heard so, and I found more than was spoken of. Thus I was struck by Prepossession, and the Poison first instilled into my Heart be∣fore I saw or knew her, can never be removed from thence by all that I shall ever see or know. I would not profane a Confession as sincere as ever was a dying Man's with the least Aug∣mentation of Truth. I will not pretend that I have not endeavoured to remove, by any other Object, a Stroke of Fate (as I may call it) that has given and will give me such Uneasiness. Were I to make a Wish for a Friend, he should have many Half-Passions, but none such as I have felt for her.</P>
<P>O! This would content me alone, that she might know how long I have struggled against her Charms in vain.</P>
<P>As the Beginning of my Fate was extraordi∣nary, I think all the Steps of it have been and will be out of the common Road. The Foun∣dation of a common Passion is a Desire to please ones self, but the Aim of mine is only to please her I adore.</P>

O! How shall I express my self? What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall I say? Or is it possible to be silent? There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a distracted Language she does not under∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tand; the Dialect is particular to them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove; and the cruel Lady will find no Sense in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because she is insensible. She must not then play the Critick too severely, if she should chance to hear my Complaints. She must ex∣cuse my accusing her of Ignorance. What is it she does not understand but Love? Vows, Curses, Melancholy, Madness, Hopes, Despair, Shunning, Pursuing, Passion, Discretion, Im∣patience, Resignation; all these in one Letter, she would call a romantick Heap of Contra∣dictions shuffled together; yet they do all a∣gree in me, and work at once in my distracted Mind. If the greatest Wit had put them toge∣ther with the utmost Art and Passion, they would express less than I feel: The Thoughts would be below my Love, and not above the Truth.</P>

O the false Fires with which the persecuting Fops afflict your Sex! Every Way false! They are not such as warm my Breast. Though I could leap through Flames to come to her, and not feel more Heat; though I could swim through Seas, and not quench the Flame; yet I love with that Cool∣ness and Temper, with that Command over my Passion, that, rather than bring her to the least Inconveniency, I would renounce the ut∣most Happiness if it were in my Reach. One would think this were enough to be allowed the most passionate, the most miserable of Men. Misery beyond this is hardly to be conceived. This seems Torment enough in Love to drag an afflicted Heart through so many distracted Fears for such an Eternity: But to have lived accused of having deserved her Anger, to think I was accounted Criminal, that knew the ten∣der faithful Passion of my Soul; to live thus for Ages, for many Months without obtaining one happy to be justified, without doing any Thing rash or indiscreet to show my Innocence: This you will sure allow to have been Torment and Discretion beyond any Example.</P>
