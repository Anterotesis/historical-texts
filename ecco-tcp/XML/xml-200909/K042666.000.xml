<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Large and elegant bridge, forming a way over a broad and rapid river, is justly esteemed one of the noblest pieces of mechanism that man is capable of performing. And the usefulness of an art which, at the same time that it con∣nects distant shores by a way over the deep and rapid waters, also allows those waters and their navigation to pass smooth and uninterrupted, renders all probable attempts to advance the theory or practice of it, highly deserving the encouragement of the public.</P>
<P>This little book is offered as an attempt towards the per∣fection of the theory of this art, in which the properties, di∣mensions, proportions, and other relations of the various parts of a bridge, are strictly demonstrated, and clearly illustrated by various examples. It is divided into five sections: the <HI>1st</HI> treats on the projects of bridges, containing a regular detail of the various circumstances and considerations that are cog∣nizable in such projects: The <HI>2d</HI> treats on arches, demon∣strating their various properties, with the relations between their intrados and extrados, and clearly distinguishes the most preferable curves to be used in a bridge; the first two or three propositions being instituted after the manner of two or three done by Mr. Emerson in his Fluxions and Mechanics: The <HI>3d</HI> section treats on the piers, demonstrating their thick∣ness necessary for supporting any kind of an arch, springing at any height, and that both when part of the pier is supposed to be immersed in water, and when otherwise: The <HI>4th</HI> de∣monstrates the force of the water against the end or face of the pier, considered as of different forms; with the best form for dividing the stream, &amp;c. and to it is added a table shewing the several heights of the fall of the water under the arches, arising from its velocity and the obstruction of the piers; as it was composed by Tho. Wright, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Auckland, in the county of Durham, who informs me it is part of a word on which he has spent much time, and with which he intends to favour the public: And the <HI>5th</HI> and last section contains a dictionary of the most material terms peculiar to the subject;
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>in which many practical observations and directions are given, which could not be so regularly nor properly introduced into the former sections. The whole, it is presumed, containing full directions for constituting and adapting to one another, the several essential parts of a bridge, so as to make it the strongest; and the most convenient, both for the passage over and under it, that the situation and other circumstances will possibly admit: not indeed for the actual methods of disposing the stones, making of mortar, or the external ornaments, &amp;c. those things I do not descend to, but leave to the discretion of the practical architect, as being no part of the plan of my un∣dertaking; and for the same reason also I have given no views of bridges, but only prints of such parts or figures as are ne∣cessary in explaining the elementary parts of the subject.</P>
<P>As my profession is not that of an architect, very probably I should never have turned my thoughts to this subject, so as to address the public upon it, had it not been from the occasion of an accident in that part of the country in which I reside, viz. the fall of Newcastle and other bridges on the river Tyne on the <HI>17th</HI> of november <HI>1771,</HI> occasioned by a high flood which rose about <HI>9</HI> feet higher at Newcastle than the usual spring tides do.—And this occasion having furnished me with many opportunities of hearing and seeing very absurd things advanced on the subject in general, I thought the demonstrations of the relations of the essential parts of a bridge, would not be unac∣ceptable to those architects and others who may be capable of perceiving the force of them, and whose ignorance may not have prejudiced them against things which they do not un∣derstand.</P>
<P>In the <HI>4th</HI> section there is one thing forgotten to be re∣marked, viz. That in determining the best form of the end of the pier to be a right-lined triangle, the water was supposed to strike every part of it with the same velocity: had the vari∣ably increased velocity been used, the form of the ends would come out a little curved; but as the increase of the velocity in the best bridges is very small, the difference in them is quite imperceptable.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRINCIPLES OF STONE BRIDGES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Of the Projects of Bridges, with the Design; Estimate, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a bridge is deemed necessary to be built over a river, the first consideration is the place of it; or what particular situation will contain a maximum of the advantages over the disadvantages.</P>
<P>In agitating this most important question, e∣very circumstance, certain and probable, attend∣ing or likely to attend the bridge, should be separately, minutely, and impartially stated and examined; and the advantage or disadvantage of it rated at a value proportioned to it: then the difference between the whole advantages and
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>disadvantages, will be the neat value of that particular situation for which the calculation is made. And by doing the same for any other situations, all their neat values will be found, and of consequence the most preferable situation among them.—Or, in a competition between two place, if each one's advantage over the other be estimated or valued in every circum∣stance attending them, the sums of their advan∣tages will shew whether of them is the better. And the same being done for this and a third, and so on, the best situation of all will be ob∣tained.</P>
<P>In this estimation, a great number of particu∣lars must be included; and nothing omitted that can be found to make a part of the consideration.</P>
<P>Among these, the situation of the town or place for the convenience of which the bridge is chiefly to be made, will naturally produce a particular of the first consequence; and a great many others ought to be sacrificed to it. If possible, the bridge should be placed where there can conveniently be opened and made passages or streets from the ends of it in every direction, and especially one as nearly in the direction of the bridge itself as possible, tending towards the body of the town, without narrows or crooked windings, and easily communicating with the chief streets, thoroughfares, &amp;c.—And here
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>every person, in judging of this, should divest himself of all partial regards or attachments what∣ever; think and determine for the good of the whole only, and for posterity as well as the pre∣sent.</P>
<P>The banks or declivities towards the river are also of particular concern, as they affect the conveniency of the passage to and from the bridge, or determine the height of it, upon which in a great measure depends the expence.</P>
<P>The breadth of the river, the navigation upon it, and the quantity of water to be passed, or the velocity and depth of the stream, from also considerations of great moment; as they deter∣mine the bridge to be higher or lower, longer or shorter. However, in most cases, a wide part of the river ought rather to be chosen than a narrow one, especially if it is subject to great tides or floods; for, the increased velocity of the stream in the narrow part, being again aug∣mented by the farther contraction of the breadth, by the piers of the bridge, will both incommode the navigation through the arches, and under∣mine the piers and endanger the whole bridge.</P>
<P>The nature of the bed of the river is also of great concern, it having a great influence on the expence; as upon it, and the depth and velocity
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>of the stream, depend the manner of laying the foundations, and building the piers.</P>
<P>These are the chief and capital articles of con∣sideration, and which will branch themselves out into other dependent ones, and so lead to the required estimate of the whole.</P>
<P>HAVING resolved on the place, the next con∣siderations are the form, the estimate of the ex∣pence, and the manner of execution.</P>
<P>With respect to the form; strength, utility, and beauty ought to be regarded and united; the chief part of which lies in the arches. The form of the arches will depend on their height and span; and the height on that of the water, the navigation, and the adjacent banks. They ought to be made so high, as that they may easily transmit the water at its greatest height either from tides or floods; and their height and figure ought also to be such as will easily allow of a convenient passage of the craft through them. This and the disposition of it above, so as to ren∣der the passage over it also convenient, make up its utility.—Having fixed the heights of the arches, their spans are still necessary for de∣termining their figure. Their spans will be known by dividing the whole breadth of the river into a convenient number of arches and piers, allowing at least the necessary thickness of
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>the piers out of the whole. In fixing on the number of arches, take always an odd number, and rather take few and large ones than many and smaller, if convenient: For thus you will have not only fewer foundations and piers to make, with fewer arches and centers, which will produce great savings in the expence, but the arches themselves will also require much less ma∣terials and workmanship, and allow of more and better passage for the water and craft through them; and will appear at the same time more noble and beautiful, especially if constructed in elliptical, or in cycloidal forms: for the truth of which it may be sufficient to refer to that noble and elegant bridge lately built at Blackfriars, London, by Mr. Mylne. And here I can't help remarking that the Gentleman who, a few years since in a pamphlet on the Principles of Bridges, censured Mr. Mylne and Mr. Muller concerning elliptic arches, has very much exposed himself, and absurdly criticises them through his own want of mathematical knowledge, which he some∣where in the same pamphlet affects to despise. He brings to my mind an expression of (I think) Mr. Henry Fielding somewhere in his works, That a person does not speak the worse on a subject for knowing something about it. I do not however make this remark through any par∣ticular disrespect for this Gentleman, concerning whom I know nothing farther, any more than I do about the other two Gentlemen, but only to
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>prevent others from being prejudiced and misled by the authority of his <HI>ipse dixit.</HI>—If the top of the bridge be a streight horizontal line, let the arches be made all of a size; if it be a little lower at the ends than the middle, the arches must pro∣portionally decrease from the middle towards the ends; but if higher at the ends than the middle, let them increase towards the ends. A choice of the most convenient arches is to be made from the 4th and 5th propositions, where their several properties, &amp;c. are demonstrated and pointed out; Among them, the elliptic, cycloi∣dal, and equilibrial arch in prop. 5, will gene∣rally claim the preference, both on account of their strength, beauty, and cheapness or saving in materials and labour: Other particulars also concerning them may be seen under the word ARCH in the Dictionary in the last section, And as the choice of the arch is of so great moment, let no person, either through ignorance or indo∣lence, prefer a worse arch because it may seem to him easier to construct; for he would very ill deserve the name or employment of an Archi∣tect, who is incapable of rendering the exact construction of these curves easy and familiar to himself; but if, by chance, a Bridge-builder should be employed who is incapable of doing that, he ought at least to be endowed with such a share of honesty as to procure some person to go through the calculations which he cannot make for himself.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10"/>Next find what thickness at the keystone or top will be necessary for the arches. For which see the word KEYSTONE in the Dictionary in the last section.</P>
<P>Having thus obtained all the parts of the arches, with the height of the piers, the neces∣sary thickness of the piers themselves are next to be computed by prop. 10.</P>
<P>This done, the chief and material requisites are found; the elevation and plans of the design can then be drawn, and the calculations of the expence form thence made, including the foun∣dations, with such ornamental or accidental ap∣pendages as shall be thought fit; which I shall leave to the discretion of the Practical Architect, as being no part of the plan of my undertaking, together with the practical methods of carrying the design into execution. I shall however, in the Dictionary in the last section, not only de∣scribe the terms, parts, machines, &amp;c. but also speak of their dimensions, properties, and any thing else material belonging to them; and to which therefore I from hence refer for more ex∣plicit information in each particular article, as well as to these immediately following proposi∣tions, in which the theory of the arches, piers, &amp;c. are fully and strictly demonstrated.</P>

<P>BY the resolution of forces, each of the weights or forces Bb, Cc, Dd, &amp;c. in the diagonals of the parallelograms, is equal to, and may be re∣solved into two forces expressed by two adjacent sides of the parallelogram; viz. the force Bb will be resolved into the two forces Bm, Bn, and in those directions; the force Cc into the two forces Cp, Cq, and in those directions; the force Dd into the two forces Dr, Ds, and in those directions; and so on: Then, since two forces that are equal, and in opposite directions, do mutually balance each other; therefore the several pairs of forces Bn and Cp, Cq and Dr, Ds and Et, &amp;c. being equal and opposite, by the construction, do mutually destroy or balance each other; and the extreme forces Bm, Ev, are balanced by the opposite resistances of the sixed points A, F. Wherefore there is no force

<P>BY the last proposition the weights are as Bb, Cc, Dd, &amp;c. when Bn = pC, Cq = rD, Ds = tE, &amp;c. But, since the angle ABb is = the angle
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>Bbn, and the angle BCc = the angle Ccq, &amp;c. as being always the alternate angles made by a line cutting two other parallel lines; also the sine of the ∠ ABC = s. ∠ Bnb, and s. ∠ BCD = s. ∠ Cqc, as being supplements one to ano∣ther; by plane trigonometry we shall have (Bn=) Bb×s.∠ABb / s.∠ABC = (Cp=) Cc×s.∠cCD / S.∠BCD, (Cq=) Cc×s.∠BCc / s.∠BCD = (Dr=) Dd×s.∠dDE / s.∠CDE, (Ds=) Dd×s.∠CDd / s.∠CDE = (Et=) Ee×s.∠eEF / s.∠DEF, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Now supposing these narrow parallelograms to stand upon indefinitely small equal parts of the arch, their breadths will be directly as the s. ∠ kCI and inversly as radius; hence the pa∣rallelogram IC × s. ∠ kCI is as <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and consequently the altitude IC as <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> or as the <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; CP being perpendicular to CI, and the radius all along equal to unity.</P>

<P>HENCE KIG is a curve running up an infi∣nite height towards G, the perpendicular AG being an asymptote to it: And the curve is accurately as represented in the figure, when the thickness DK at the top is 1-15th of the span.</P>

<HEAD>Corollary <HI>2.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT the curve KIG is quite inconvenient for the form of the ex∣trados of any bridge; <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> however a streight ho∣rizontal line IK might be used instead of it, if the materials of which the arch is built, could
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>be so chosen, as that they might increase in their specific gravity from DK towards CI, continually as the cube of the secant of the arch from D. And this again perhaps would be quite impracticable: But if a circular arch and a right line at the top were <HI>necessarily</HI> required, the proportion of DK to the radius DQ may be found so as the arch may be <HI>nearly</HI> in equilibrium thus:</P>
<P>When KI is a right line, then KR in the figure to the example, must be nothing; or ra∣ther when the curve crosses the horizontal line, then KR is equal to nothing; put its value then, as found above, equal to o, and we shall have <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and from this equation, by assuming one of the quantities, <HI>a, y,</HI> the corresponding value of the other may be found for the point where the curve crosses the horizontal line; so from hence the general value of <HI>a</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. Now this va∣lue of <HI>a</HI> or DK evidently becomes = 0 when the arch consists of the whole semi-circle; but
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>when the arch is less than the semicircle, <HI>a</HI> will have a finite value, and between 60 and 120 de∣grees many arches of equilibration of a certain thickness at top may be found. Thus, if the half arch DC contain 30 degrees; then its sine <HI>y</HI> or PC is = ½<HI>r;</HI> which being substituted for it in the above general value of <HI>a,</HI> we have <HI>a</HI> = 7√3−6/37 × 3\2 <HI>r,</HI> or = ¼<HI>r</HI> extremely near; that is, DK is = ¼ of DQ or ¼ of 2PC the span when the curve cuts the horizontal line directly above the point in the circle which an∣swers to 30 degrees. And if DC were an arch of 45 degrees; then <HI>y</HI> = <HI>r</HI>√1/2, and <HI>a</HI> = 3√2−2/14 × <HI>r</HI> = 16<HI>r</HI>/100, or 1/9 of the span nearly. Also, if DC were 60 degrees; then <HI>y</HI> = <HI>r</HI>√3/4, and <HI>a</HI> = 1/14th of <HI>r</HI> = 7<HI>r</HI>/100, or 1/16 of the span nearly.— So that in each of these cases the points C and D would be in equilibrium; but then about the middle parts between D and C, or rather nearer to D than to C, the materials should be a little lighter than at D and C, and the exact propor∣tion in which their gravity should be diminished, might easily be found by calculation; so in the first case, in particular, the specific gravity of the materials in the middle of the arch between D and C, that is at 15 degrees from D, should be to that at D or C, as 278 to 284, which is
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>but a very inconsiderable decrease, and may be very well neglected.—In the first two cases, the thickness at the top would be too much; but in the latter one, when the whole arch is 120 degrees, the thickness is just about that which the best architects now allow; and in greater arches the thickness would become too little. So that an arch of nearly about 120 de∣grees, is the only part of a circle that can be used with any degree of propriety.</P>

<P>As we have found above that the extrados will be a streight horizontal line when <HI>a</HI> is equal

<P>Now the equation to the curve expressed in terms of <HI>c, x,</HI> and <HI>y,</HI> is <HI>y</HI> = <HI>c</HI> × hyp. log. of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; and when <HI>x</HI> and <HI>y</HI> are given, the value of <HI>c</HI> may be found from this equation, by the method of trial and error.

<P>Since then <HI>y</HI> is = <HI>c</HI> × hyp. log. of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, by taking the fluxion of this equation, we have <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> by writing <HI>d</HI> for 2<HI>c;</HI> and by ex∣panding this expression into a series, it becomes <HI>ẏ</HI> = <HI>ẋ</HI> √ <HI>d</HI>/<HI>x</HI> × ∶ 1 − <HI>x</HI>/2<HI>d</HI> + 1·3<HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/2·4<HI>d</HI><SUP>2</SUP> − 1·3·5<HI>x</HI><SUP>3</SUP>/2·4·6<HI>d</HI><SUP>3</SUP> + 1·3·5·7<HI>x</HI><SUP>4</SUP>/2·4·6·8<HI>d</HI> &amp;c.

Then, by reverting this series, we have <HI>w</HI> = <HI>v</HI> + 1/6<HI>v</HI> − 37/360<HI>v</HI><SUP>3</SUP> + 547/5040<HI>v</HI><SUP>5</SUP> − 337/5600<HI>v</HI><SUP>7</SUP> &amp;c. And hence, by squaring, &amp;c. and restoring the ori∣ginal letters, it is (½<HI>d</HI> = ½<HI>xw</HI><SUP>2</SUP> =) <HI>c</HI> = ½<HI>x</HI> × ∶ <HI>y</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/<HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP> + ⅓ − 8<HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/45<HI>y</HI><SUP>2</SUP> + 691<HI>x</HI><SUP>4</SUP>/3780<HI>y</HI><SUP>4</SUP> − 23851<HI>x</HI><SUP>6</SUP>/453600<HI>y</HI><SUP>6</SUP> &amp;c. where a few of the first terms are sufficient to determine the value of <HI>c</HI> pretty nearly.</P>
<P>Now, for an example in numbers, suppose the height of the arch to be 40 feet, and its span 100, which are nearly the dimensions of the middle arch of Blackfriar's Bridge at Lon∣don. Then <HI>x</HI> = 40, and <HI>y</HI> = 50; which being substituted for them in this series, it gives <HI>c</HI> = 36.88 feet nearly. So that to have made that arch a catenarian one, with a streight line above, the top of the arch must have been almost of the
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>immense thickness of 37 feet, to have kept it in equilibrium.</P>
<P>But if the height and span be 40 and 100 feet, as above, and the thickness of the arch at top be assumed equal to 6 feet, then the extrados will not be a right line, but as it is drawn in the figure to this example, which figure is accurately constructed according to these dimensions.</P>
<P>It may be farther remarked, that the curves in these last three examples, viz. the parabola, hy∣perbola, and catenary, are all very improper for the arches of a bridge consisting of several arches; because it is evident from their figures, which are all accurately constructed, that all the build∣ing or filling up of the flanks of the arches will tend to destroy the equilibrium of them. But in a bridge of one single arch whose extrados rises pretty much from the spring to the top, one of these figures will answer better than any of the former ones.</P>

<P>Hence then, by substituting in this equation the given value of <HI>z</HI> instead of it, as expressed in terms of <HI>y,</HI> the resulting equation will then involve only <HI>x</HI> and <HI>y</HI> together with their first and second fluxions, besides constant quantities.

<P>By taking AQ = <HI>h</HI> = 50, and DQ = <HI>r</HI> = 40, also DK = <HI>a</HI> = 6. Then the hyp. log.
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> is = the hyp. log. of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> the hyp. log. of 15·26784 = 2·7257487; by which dividing <HI>h</HI> = 50, the quo∣tient is 18·343584. So that the ordinate <HI>y</HI> will be constantly in that case equal to 18·343584 × the hyp. log. of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. Also 1/18·343584 = .05451497 is = <HI>D,</HI> and <HI>A</HI> = hyp. log. of 6 = 1·7917594; then <HI>N</HI> = the number whose hyp. log. is 1·7917594 + .05451497<HI>y.</HI> And then by assuming several values of one of the letters <HI>x, y,</HI> the corresponding values of the other will be found from one of the two equa∣tions above.</P>
<P>And in this manner were calculated the num∣bers in the following table; from which the curve being constructed, it will be as appears in the figure to the example.—And thus we have an arch in equilibrium in all its parts, and its top a streight line, as is generally required in most bridges; or at least they are so near a ho∣rizontal line, that their difference from it will cause no sensible ill consequence. It is also both both of a graceful figure, and of a convenient form for the passage through it. So that there can be no good reason for neglecting to use it in works of any consequence.</P>

<P>Now (by prop. 63 <HI>Emer.</HI> Mechan.) the weight of the arch is to its pressure in the direction AB, as NM is to MA; hence <HI>h</HI> ∶ <HI>c</HI> ∷ <HI>A</HI> ∶ <HI>cA</HI>/<HI>h</HI> = the force or shoot of the arch in the direction AB; which being drawn into the length of the lever BG = d, we have <HI>cdA</HI>/<HI>h</HI> for the effica∣cious force of the arch to overset the pier, or to turn it about the point G. Again, <HI>ex</HI> is = the area of the section of the pier; which being supposed to be collected into the middle line EF, it may be considered as a weight appended to the end E of the lever EG; therefore <HI>ex</HI> × EG = ½<HI>exx</HI> will be the efficacious force of the pier to prevent its being overturned.

<P>In the above investigation it is supposed that the whole of the pier was out of water: But if any part of it OL be supposed to be im∣mersed in water, that part will lose so much of its weight as is equal to its bulk of water; and since the specific gravity of water is to that of common stone, as 1 is to 2½, or as 2 to 5, it is evident that OL will lose 2 parts in 5 of its weight. Hence then, putting <HI>g</HI> = OG, since OG × GL = <HI>gx</HI> is the area immersed, there∣fore ⅖<HI>gx</HI> = the weight lost by the immersion; which being taken from <HI>ex</HI> the whole, we shall have <HI>ex</HI> − 2/6<HI>gx</HI> as the weight remaining ap∣pended to E; then this being drawn into GE = ½<HI>x,</HI> and the product equated to the efficacious force of the arch as before, we have ½<HI>exx</HI> − 1/5 <HI>gxx</HI> = <HI>cdA</HI>/<HI>h</HI>; and hence <HI>x</HI> = √ 10<HI>cdA</HI>/<HI>h</HI>·5<HI>e</HI>−2<HI>g</HI> for the thickness of the pier when it is im∣mersed in water to the height expressed by <HI>g.</HI> —Or, because <HI>g</HI> will be nearly equal to <HI>d,</HI> the theorem for the thickness may be <HI>x</HI> = √ 10<HI>cdA</HI>/<HI>h</HI>·5<HI>e</HI>−2<HI>d</HI> = √ 10AM×AL×<HI>A</HI>/DQ×5EF−2AL.</P>

<P>IN the investigation of this proposition, the sections of the arch and pier are used for their solidities, as being evidently in the same pro∣portion, or in that of their weights, since they are of the same length, viz. the breadth of the bridge.</P>
<P>By the above rules, together with those in the four preceding propositions, the necessary thick∣ness of a pier may be found, so that it shall <HI>just</HI> balance the spread or shoot of the arch, independent of any other arch on the other side of the pier. But the weight of the pier ought a little to preponderate against or exceed in ef∣fect the shoot of the arch; and therefore the thickness ought to be taken a little more than what will be found by these rules; unless it be supposed that the pointed projections of the piers against the stream, beyond the common breadth of the bridge, will be a sufficient addi∣tion to the pier, to give it the necessary pre∣ponderancy. —But there is one very material thing, on account of which the thickness of the piers may be much diminished; viz. by the
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>stones of the wall above the voussoirs being bonded in with those of the pier and with one another, the pier will carry part of their weight; which will not only diminish the weight of the whole arch and wall, but will also both add the same to the weight of the pier, and lengthen the lever EG, by moving the center of gravity a little nearer to L; but then also M will be a little nearer to Q, so that AM will be longer, and the effects of the change of the centers of gravity may be supposed nearly to balance each other.—In the foregoing propo∣sitions I have considered circular arches only, as it will make no difference of any consequence, to suppose the arches of any other curve of the same span and pitch. But this 10th prop. is general for all curves.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> Of the Terms or Names of the various parts peculiar to a Bridge, and the Machines, &amp;c. used about it; disposed in alphabetical order.</HEAD>
<P>ABUTMENT, or BUTMENT, which see in its place below.</P>
<P>ARCH, and opening of a bridge, through or under which the water, &amp;c. passes, and which is supported by piers or by butments.</P>
<P>Arches are denominated circular, elliptical, cycloidal, catenarian, &amp;c. according to the figure of the curve of them. There are also other denominations of circular arches according to the different parts of a circle: So, a semicircular arch is half the circle; a scheme or skeen arch is a segment less than the semicircle; and arches of the third and fourth point, or gothic arches, consist of two circular arcs, excentric and meet∣ing in an angle at top, each being 1-3d or 1-4th, &amp;c. of the whole circle.</P>
<P>The chief properties of the most considerable arches, with regard to the extrados they re∣quire, &amp;c. may be learned from the second sec∣tion. It there appears that none, but the arch
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>of equilibration in the example to prop. 5, can admit of a horizontal line at top; that this arch is not only of a graceful but of a convenient form, as it may be made higher or lower at pleasure with the same opening; that it, but no other, with a horizontal top, can be equally strong in all its parts, and therefore ought to be used in all works of much consequence. All the other arches require tops that are curved either upward or downward, some more and some less: Of these the elliptical arch seems to be the fittest to be substituted instead of the equilibrial one with any tolerable degree of propriety; it is in general also the best form for most bridges, as it can be made of any height to the same span, or of any span to the same height, while at the same time its hanches are sufficiently ele∣vated above the water, even when it is pretty flat at top; which is a property of which the other curves are not possessed in the same de∣gree; and this property is the more valuable, because it is remarked that after an arch is built and the centering struck, it settles more about the hanches than the other parts, by which other curves are reduced near to a streight line at the hanches. Elliptical arches also look bolder, are really stronger, and require less ma∣terials and labour than the others. Of the other curves, the cycloidal arch is next in quality to the elliptical one, for all the above properties. And, lastly, the circle. As to the others, the
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>parabola, hyperbola, and catenary, they may not at all be admitted in bridges of several arches; but may in some cases be used for a bridge of one single arch which is to rise very high, because then not much loaded at the hanches. We may hence also perceive the fal∣sity of those arguments which assert, that be∣cause the catenarian curve supports itself equally in all its parts, it will therefore best support any additional weight laid upon it: for the additional building made to raise the bridge to a horizontal line, or nearly such, by pressing more in one part than another, must force those parts down, and the whole must fall. Whereas other curves will not support themselves at all without some additional parts built above them, to balance them, or to reduce their parts to an equilibrium.</P>
<P>ARCHIVOLT, the curve or line formed by the upper sides of the voussoirs or arch stones. It is parallel to the intrados or underside of the arch when the voussoirs are all of the same length; otherwise not.</P>
<P>By the archivolt is also sometimes understood the whole set of voussoirs.</P>
<P>BANQUET, the raised foot path at the sides of the bridge next the parapet. This ought to be allowed in all bridges of any considerable
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>size: it should be raised about a foot above the middle or horse passage, made 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. feet broad according to the size of the bridge, and paved with large stones whose length is equal to the breadth of the walk.</P>
<P>BATTARDEAU, or <HI>Coffer-dam,</HI> a case of pi∣ling, &amp;c. without a bottom, fixed in the bed of the river, water-tight or nearly so, by which to lay the bottom dry for a space large enough to build the pier on. When it is fixed, its sides reaching above the level of the water, the water is pumped out of it, or drawn off by engines, &amp;c. till the space be dry; and it is kept so by the same means, if there are leaks which cannot be stopped, till the pier is built up in it; and then the materials of it are drawn up again.</P>
<P>Battardeaux are made in various manners, either by a single inclosure, or by a double one, with clay or chalk rammed in between the two, to prevent the water from coming through the sides. And these inclosures are also made either with piles only, driven close by one another, and sometimes notched or dove-tailed into each other; or with piles grooved in the sides, driven in at a distance from one another, and boards let down between them in the grooves.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="88"/>The method of building in battardeaux can∣not well be used where the river is either deep or rapid. It also requires a very good natural bottom of solid earth or clay; for, although the sides be made water-tight, if the bottom or bed of the river be of a loose consistence, the water will ooze up through it in too great abundance to be evacuated by the engines.</P>
<P>It is almost needless to remark that the sides must be made very strong, and well propt or braced in the inside, to prevent the ambient water from pressing the sides in, and forcing its way into the battardeau.</P>
<P>BRIDGE, a work of carpentry or masonry, built over a river, canal, &amp;c. for the conve∣niency of crossing the same.</P>
<P>A stone bridge is an edifice forming a way over a river, &amp;c. supported by one arch or by several arches, and these again supported by proper piers or butments.</P>
<P>A stately bridge over a large river is one of the most noble and striking pieces of art. To behold huge and bold arches, composed of an immense quantity of small materials, as stones, bricks, &amp;c. so disposed and united together that
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>they seem to form but one solid compact body, affording a safe passage for men and carriages over large waters, which with their navigation pass free and easy under them at the same time, is a sight truly surprizing and affecting indeed.</P>
<P>To the absolutely necessary parts of a bridge already mentioned, viz. the arches, piers, and abutments, may be added the paving at top, the parapet wall, either with or without a ba∣lustrade, &amp;c. also the banquet or raised foot way on each side, leaving a sufficient breadth in the middle for horses and carriages. The breadth of a bridge for a great city should be such as to allow an easy passage for three carriages and two horsemen a-breast in the middle way, and for three foot passengers in the same manner on each banquet. And for other less bridges a less breadth.</P>
<P>As a bridge is made for a way or passage over a river, &amp;c. so it ought to be made of such a height as will be quite convenient for that passage; but yet so as to be consistent with the interest and concerns of the river itself, easily admitting through its arches the craft that navi∣gate upon it, and all the water even at high tides and floods. The neglect of this precept has been the ruin of many bridges, and parti∣cularly that at Newcastle, over the river Tyne, on the 17th of november 1771. So that in de∣termining
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>its height, the conveniencies both of the passage over it and under it should be con∣sidered, and the height made to answer the best for them both, observing to make the <HI>convenient</HI> give place to the <HI>necessary</HI> when their interests are opposite.</P>
<P>Bridges are generally placed in a direction perpendicular to the stream in a direct line, to give free passage to the water, &amp;c. But some think they should be made not in a streight line, but convex towards the stream, the better to resist floods, &amp;c. And some such bridges have been made.</P>
<P>Again, a bridge should not be made in too narrow a part of a navigable river, or one sub∣ject to tides or floods: because the breadth be∣ing still more contracted by the piers, will in∣crease the depth, velocity, and fall of the water under the arches, and endanger the whole bridge and navigation.</P>
<P>The number of arches of a bridge are gene∣rally made odd; either that the middle of the stream or chief current may flow freely without the interruption of a pier; or that the two halves of the bridge, by gradually rising from the ends to the middle, may there meet in the highest and largest arch; or else, for the sake of grace, that by being open in the middle, the eye in
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>viewing it may look directly through there, as one always expects to do in looking at it, and without which opening one generally feels a disappointment in viewing it.</P>
<P>If the bridge be equally high throughout, the arches, being all of a height, are made all of a size; which causes a great saving of centering. If the bridge be higher in the middle than at the ends, let the arches decrease from the middle to∣wards each end, but so as that each half have the arches exactly alike, and that they decrease in span, proportionally to their height, so as to be always the same kind of figure, and similar parts of that figure: thus, if one be a semicircle, let the rest be semicircles also, but proportionally less; if one be a segment of a circle, let the rest be similar segments of other circles; and so for other figures. The arches being equal at equal distances on both sides of the middle, is not only for the strength and beauty of the bridge, but that the centering of the one half may serve for the other also. But if the bridge be higher at the ends than in the middle, the arches ought to increase in span and pitch from the middle towards the ends.</P>
<P>When the middle and ends are of different heights, their difference however ought not to be great in proportion to the length, that the ascent may be easy; and then also it is more
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>beautiful to make the top one continued curve than two inclined streight lines from the ends towards the middle.</P>
<P>Bridges should rather be of few and large arches than of many and small ones, if the height and situation will possibly allow of it; for this will leave more free passage for the water and navigation, and be a great saving in materials and labour, as there will be fewer piers and centers, and the arches themselves will require less materials.</P>
<P>For the fabric of a bridge, and the proper estimation of the expence, &amp;c. there are gene∣rally necessary three plans, three sections, and an elevation. The three plans are so many horizontal sections, viz. the first a plan of the foundation under the piers, with the particular circumstances attending it, whether of gratings, planks, piles, &amp;c. the second is the plan of the piers and arches, &amp;c. and the third is the plan of the superstructure, with the paved road and banquet. The three sections are vertical ones; the first of them a longitudinal section from end to end and through the middle of the breadth; the second a transverse one, or across it, and through the summit of an arch; and the third also across, and taken upon a pier. The eleva∣tion is an orthographic projection of one side or face of the bridge, or its appearance as viewed
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>at an infinite distance, and shews the exterior aspect of the materials, and the manner in which they are worked and decorated.</P>
<P>Other observations are to be seen in the first section.</P>
<P>BUTMENTS, or <HI>abutments,</HI> the extremities of a bridge, by which it joins to or abuts upon the land or sides of the river, &amp;c. These must be made very secure, quite immovable, and more than barely sufficient to resist the drift of its adjacent arch. So that if there are not rocks or very solid banks to raise them against, they must be well reinforced with proper walls or returns, &amp;c. The thickness of them that will be barely sufficient to resist the shoot of the arch, may be calculated as that of a pier by prop. 10.</P>
<P>When the foundation of a butment is raised against a sloping bank of rock, gravel, or good solid earth, it will produce a saving of materials and labour, to carry the work on by returns at different heights, like steps of stairs.</P>
<P>CAISSON, a kind of <HI>chest,</HI> or flat-bottomed boat, in which a pier is built, then sunk to the bed of the river, and the sides loosened and taken off from the bottom, by a contrivance for that purpose; the bottom of it being left
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>under the pier as a foundation. It is evident therefore that the bottoms of caissons must be made very strong and fit for the foundations of the piers. The caisson is kept a-float till the pier be built to about the height of low-water mark; and for that purpose its sides must either be made of more than that height at first, or else gradually raised to it as it sinks by the weight of the work, so as always to keep its top above water. And therefore the sides must be made very strong, and kept asunder by cross timbers within, lest the great pressure of the ambient water crush the sides in, and so not only endanger the work, but also drown the men who work within it. The caisson is made of the shape of the pier, but some feet wider on every side to make room for the men to work: the whole of the sides are of two pieces, both joined to the bottom quite around, and to each other at the salient angle, so as to be disengaged from the bottom and from each other when the pier is raised to the desired height, and sunk. It is also convenient to have a little sluice made in the bottom, occasionally to open and shut, to sink the caisson and pier sometimes by, before it be finished, to try if it bottom level and rightly; for by opening the sluice, the water will rush in and fill it to the height of the exterior water, and the weight of the work already built will sink it; then by shutting the sluice again, and pumping out the
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>water, it will be made to float again, and the rest of the work may be completed: but it must not be sunk but when the sides are high enough to reach above the surface of the water, otherwise it cannot be raised and laid dry again. Mr. Labelye tells us that the caissons in which he built some of the piers of Westminster bridge, contained above 150 load of fir timber of 40 cubic feet each, and was of more tonnage or capacity than a 40 gun ship of war.</P>
<P>CENTERS, are the timber frames erected in the spaces of the arches to turn them on, by building on them the voussoirs of the arch. As the center serves as a foundation for the arch to be built on, when the arch is completed, that foundation is struck from under it, to make way for the water and navigation, and then the arch will stand of itself from its curved fi∣gure. A center must therefore be constructed of the exact figure of the intended arch, convex as the arch is concave, to receive it on as a mould. If the form be circular, the curve is struck from a central point by a radius: if it be elliptical, it ought to be struck with a dou∣bled cord, passing over two pins or nails fixed in the focusses, as the mathematicians describe their ellipses; and not by striking different pieces or arcs of circles from several centers; for these will form no ellipse at all, but an irregular mis∣shapen curve made up of broken pieces of dif∣ferent
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>circular arcs: but if the arch be of any other form, the several abscissas and ordinates ought to be calculated, then their corresponding lengths, transferred to the centering, will give so many points of the curve, and exactly by which points bending a bow of pliable matter, the curve may be drawn by it.</P>
<P>The centers are constructed of beams, &amp;c. of timber firmly pinned and bound together, into one entire compact frame, covered smooth at top with planks or boards to place the voussoirs on, the whole supported by offsets in the sides of the piers, and by piles driven into the bed of the river, and capable of being raised and depressed by wedges, contrived for that purpose, and for taking them down when the arch is completed. They ought also to be constructed of a strength more than sufficient to bear the weight of the arch.</P>
<P>In taking the center down; first let it down a little, all in a piece, by easing some of the wedges; there let it rest a few hours or days to try if the arch make any efforts to fall, or any joints open, or stones crush or crack, &amp;c. that the damage may be repaired before the center is entirely removed, which is not to be done till the arch ceases to make any visible efforts.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="97"/>In some bridges the centering makes a very considerable part of the expence, and therefore all means of saving in this article ought to be closely attended to; such as making few arches, and as nearly alike or similar as possible, that the centering of one arch may serve for others, and at least that the same center may be used for both of each pair of equal arches on both sides of the middle.</P>
<P>CHEST, the same as <HI>Caisson.</HI></P>
<P>COFFERDAM, the same as <HI>Battardeau.</HI></P>
<P>DRIFT, <HI>Shoot,</HI> or <HI>Thrust</HI> of an arch, is the push or force which it exerts in the direction of the length of the bridge. This force arises from the perpendicular gravitation of the stones of the arch, which, being kept from descending by the form of the arch and the resistance of the pier, exert their force in a lateral or hori∣zontal direction. This force is computed in prop. 10, where the thickness of the pier is de∣termined that is necessary to resist it; and is greater the lower the arch is, <HI>coeteris paribus.</HI></P>
<P>ELEVATION, the orthographic projection of the front of a bridge on the vertical plane pa∣rallel to its length. This is necessary to shew the form and dimensions of the arches and other
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>parts as to height and breadth, and therefore has a plain scale annexed to it to measure the parts by. It also shews the manner of working up and decorating the fronts of the bridge.</P>
<P>EXTRADOS, the exterior curvature or line of an arch. In the propositions of the second section it is the outer or upper line of the wall above the arch; but it often means only the upper or exterior curve of the voussoirs.</P>
<P>FOUNDATIONS, the bottoms of the piers, &amp;c. or the bases on which they are built. These bottoms are always to be made with projections, greater or less according to the spaces on which they are built. And according to the nature of the ground, depth and velocity of water, &amp;c. the foundations are laid and the piers built after different manners, either in caissons, in battar∣deaux, on stilts with sterlings, &amp;c. for the par∣ticular methods of doing which, see each under its respective term.</P>
<P>The most obvious and simple method of lay∣ing the foundations and raising the piers up to water-mark, is to turn the river out of its course above the place of the bridge, into a new channel cut for it near the place where it makes an elbow or turn; then the piers are built on dry ground, and the water turned into its old course again, the new one being securely banked
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>up. This is certainly the best method, when the new channel can be easily and conveniently made; but which however is seldom or never the case.</P>
<P>Another method is to lay only the space of each pier dry till it be built, by surrounding it with piles and planks driven down into the bed of the river, so close together as to exclude the water from coming in; then the water is pumped out of the inclosed space, the pier built in it, and lastly the piles and planks drawn up. This is coffer-dam work, but evidently cannot be practised if the bottom be of a loose con∣sistence admitting the water to ooze and spring up through it.</P>
<P>When neither the whole nor part of the river can be easily laid dry as above, other methods are to be used; such as to build either in cais∣sons or on stilts, both which methods are de∣scribed under their proper words; or yet by another method, which hath, though seldom, been sometimes used, without laying the bottom dry, and which is thus: the pier is built upon strong rafts or gratings of timber well bound together, and buoyed up on the surface of the water by strong cables, fixed to other flotes or machines, till the pier is built; the whole is then gently let down to the bottom, which must be made level for the purpose. But of
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>these methods, that of building in caissons is the best.</P>
<P>But before the pier can be built in any man∣ner, the ground at the bottom must be well secured, and made quite good and safe if it be not so naturally. The space must be bored into to try the consistence of the ground; and if a good bottom of stone, or firm gravel, clay, &amp;c. be met with within a moderate depth below the bed of the river, the loose sand, &amp;c. must be removed and digged out to it, and the foun∣dation laid on the firm bottom on a strong gra∣ting or base of timber made much broader every way than the pier, that there may be the greater base to press on, to prevent its being sunk. But if a solid bottom cannot be found at a conve∣nient depth to dig to, the space must then be driven full of strong piles, whose tops must be sawed off level some feet below the bed of the water, the sand having been previously digged out for that purpose; and then the foundation on a grating of timber laid on their tops as before. Or, when the bottom is not good, if it be made level, and a strong grating of tim∣ber, two, three, or four times as large as the base of the pier be made, it will form a good base to bulid on, its great size preventing it from sinking. In driving the piles, begin at the mid∣dle, and proceed outwards all the way to the borders or margin: the reason of which is, that
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>if the outer ones were driven first, the earth of the inner space would be thereby so jammed together, as not to allow the inner piles to be driven. And besides the piles immediately under the piers, it is also very prudent to drive in a single, double, or triple row of them around and close to the frame of the foundation, cutting them off a little above it, to secure it from slipping aside out of its place, and to bind the ground under the pier the firmer. For, as the safety of the whole bridge depends on the foun∣dation, too much care cannot be used to have the bottom made quite secure.</P>
<P>JETTEE, the border made around the stilts under a pier, being the same with <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>IMPOST, is the part of the pier on which the feet of the arches stand, or from which whey spring.</P>
<P>KEYSTONE, the middle voussoir, or the arch stone in the top or immediately over the center of the arch. The length of the keystone, or thickness of the archivolt at top, is allowed to be about 1-15th or 1-16th of the span, by the best architects.</P>
<P>ORTHOGRAPHY, the elevation of a bridge, or front view as seen at an infinite distance.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="102"/>PARAPET, the breast wall made on the top of a bridge to prevent passengers from falling over. In good bridges, to build the parapet but a little part of its height close or solid, and upon that a balustrade to above a man's height, has an elegant effect.</P>
<P>PIERS, the walls built for the support of the arches, and from which they spring as their bases.</P>
<P>They ought to be built of large blocks of stone, solid throughout, and cramped together with iron, which will make the whole as one solid stone. Their faces or ends, from the base up to high-water mark, ought to project sharp out with a salient angle, to divide the stream. Or, perhaps, the bottom of the pier should be built flat or square up to about half the height of low-water mark, to allow a lodgment against it for the sand and mud, to cover the founda∣tion; lest, by being left bare, the water should in time undermine and so ruin or injure it. The best form of the projection for dividing the stream, is the triangle; and the longer it is, or the more acute the salient angle, the better it will divide it, and the less will the force of the water be against the pier; but it may be suffi∣cient to make that angle a right one, as it will make the work stronger, and in that case the
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>perpendicular projection will be equal to half the breadth or thickness of the pier. In rivers on which large heavy craft navigate and pass the arches, it may perhaps be better to make the ends semicircular; for although it does not di∣vide the water so well as the triangle, it will both better turn off and bear the shock of the craft.</P>
<P>The thickness of the piers ought to be such as will make them of weight or strength sufficient to support their interjacent arch independent of any other arches. And then if the middle of the pier be run up to its full height, the centering may be struck to be used in another arch before the hanches are filled up. The whole theory of the piers may be seen in the third section.</P>
<P>They ought to be made with a broad bottom on the foundation, and gradually diminished in thickness by offsets up to low-water mark.</P>
<P>The methods of laying their foundations, and building them up to the surface of the water, are given under the word FOUNDATION.</P>
<P>PILES, are timbers driven into the bed of the river for various purposes, and are either round, square, or flat like planks. They may be of any wood which will not rot under water, but oak and fir are mostly used, especially the latter, on account of its length, streightness, and
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>cheapness. They are shod with a pointed iron at the bottom, the better to penetrate into the ground; and are bound with a strong iron band or ring at top, to prevent them from being split by the violent strokes of the ram by which they are driven down.</P>
<P>Piles are either used to build the foundations on, or are driven about the pier as a border of defence, or to support the centers on; and in this case, when the centering is removed, they must either be drawn up or sawed off very low under water; but it is perhaps better to saw them off and leave them sticking in the bot∣tom, lest the drawing of them out should loosen the ground about the foundation of the pier. Those to build on, are either such as are cut off by the bottom of the water, or rather a few feet within the bed of the river; or else such as are cut off at low-water mark, and then they are called stilts. Those to form borders of defence, are rows driven in close by the frame of a foundation, to keep it firm; or else they are to form a case or jettee about stilts, to keep within it the stones that are thrown in to fill it up; in this case, the piles are grooved, driven at a little distance from each other, and plank piles let into the grooves between them, and driven down also, till the whole space is sur∣rounded. Besides using this for stilts, it is also sometimes necessary to surround a stone pier
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>with a sterling or jettee, and fill it up with stones to secure an injured pier from being still more damaged, and the whole bridge ruined. The piles to support the centers may also serve as a border of piling to secure the foundation, cutting them off low enough after the center is removed.</P>
<P>PILE DRIVER, and engine for driving down the piles. It consists of a large ram of iron sliding perpendicularly down between two guide posts; which being lift up to the top of them, and there let fall from a great height, comes down upon the top of the pile with a violent blow. It is worked either with men or horses, and either with or without wheel-work. That which was used at the building of Westminster bridge, is perhaps the best ever invented.</P>
<P>PITCH, of an arch, the perpendicular height from the spring or impost to the keystone.</P>
<P>PLAN, of any part, as of the foundations, or piers, or superstructure, is the orthographic projection of it on a plane paralled to the ho∣rizon.</P>
<P>PUSH, of any arch, the same as drift, shoot, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106"/>SALIENT ANGLE, of a pier, the projection of the end against the stream, to divide it. The right-lined angle best divides the stream, and the more acute the better for that purpose; but the right angle is generally used as making the best masonry. A semicircular end, though it does not divide the stream so well, is sometimes better in large navigable rivers, as it carries the craft the better off, or bears their shocks the better.</P>
<P>SHOOT, of an arch, the same as drift.</P>
<P>SPRINGERS, are the first or lowest stones of an arch, being those at its feet bearing im∣mediately on the impost.</P>
<P>STERLINGS, or Jettees, a kind of case made about a pier of stilts, &amp;c. to secure it, and is particularly described under the next word <HI>Stilts.</HI></P>
<P>STILTS, a set of piles driven into the space intended for the pier, whose tops being sawed level of about low-water mark, the pier is then raised on them. This method was formerly used when the bottom of the river could not be laid dry; and these stilts were surrounded, at a few feet distance, by a row of piles and planks, &amp;c. close to them like a coffer-dam, and called a sterling or jettee; after which loose
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>stones, &amp;c. are thrown or poured down into the space till it be filled up to the top, by that means forming a kind of pier of rub∣ble or loose work, and which is kept together by the sides or sterlings: this is then paved level at the top, and the arches turned upon it. This method was formerly much used, most of the large old bridges in England being e∣rected that way, such as London bridge, New∣castle bridge, Rochester bridge, &amp;c. But the inconveniencies attending it are so great, that it is now quite exploded and disused: for, be∣cause of the loose composition of the piers, they must be made very large or broad, or else the arch would push them over and rush down as soon as the center was drawn; which great breadth of piers and sterlings so much contracts the passage of the water, as not only very much incommodes the navigation through the arch, from the fall and quick motion of the water, but from the same cause also the bridge itself is in much danger, especially in time of floods, when the water is too much for the passage. Add to this that besides the danger there is of the pier bursting out the sterlings, they are also subject to much decay and damage by the velocity of the water and the craft passing through the arches.</P>
<P>THRUST, the same as drift, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="108"/>VOUSSOIRS, the stones which immediately form the arch, their under sides constituting the intrados. The middle one, or keystone, ought to be about 1-15th or 1-16th of the span, as has been observed; and the rest should in∣crease in size all the way down to the impost; the more they increase the better, as they will the better bear the great weight which rests upon them without being crushed, and also will bind the firmer together. Their joints should also be cut perpendicular to the curve of the intrados.</P>
