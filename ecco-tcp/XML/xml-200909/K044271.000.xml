<P>THE School for LOVERS, A COMEDY.</P>
<P>As it is Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> POET LAUREAT.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed for R. and J. DODSLEY in <HI>Pall-mall;</HI> and Sold by J. HINXMAN, in <HI>Pater-noster-row.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Comedy is formed on a plan of Monsieur de Fontenelle's, never intended for the stage, and printed in the eighth volume of his works, under the title of Le Testament.</P>
<P>The scene of that piece is laid in Greece, and the embarrassing circumstances depend on some peculiarities in the customs of that coun∣try. Slaves likewise, as is usual in the Grecian Comedy, act as confidantes to the principal personages. The Author, therefore, hopes he may be excused for having made the story English, and his own; for having introduced a new character, and endeavoured to heighten those he found already sketched out. The delicacy of the sentiments in Philonoe and Eudamidas, he has inviolably adhered to, wherever he could insert them properly, in his Caelia and Sir John Dorilant; and would willingly flatter himself, that he has made great and not contemptible additions to their characters, as well as to the others.</P>
<P>Those who will give themselves the trouble to read both pieces, will see where the Author is, or is not indebted to that elegant French Writer.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. As it was intended to have been SPOKEN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SUCCESS makes people vain.—The maxim's true,</L>
<L>We all confess it — and not over new.</L>
<L>The veriest clown who stumps along the streets,</L>
<L>And doffs his hat to each grave cit he meets,</L>
<L>Some twelvemonths hence, bedaub'd with livery lace,</L>
<L>Shall thrust his saucy flambeau in your face.</L>
<L>Not so our Bard: tho' twice your kind applause</L>
<L>Has, on this fickle spot, espous'd his cause:</L>
<L>He owns, with gratitude, th' obliging debt;</L>
<L>Has twice been favour'd, and is modest yet.</L>
<L>Plain Tragedy, his first adventurous care,</L>
<L>Spoke to your hearts, and found an echo there,</L>
<L>Plain Comedy to-night, with strokes refin'd,</L>
<L>Would catch the coyest features of the mind:</L>
<L>Would play politely with your hopes and fears,</L>
<L>And sometimes smiles provoke, and sometimes tears,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your giant wits, like those of old, may climb</L>
<L>Olympus high, and step o'er space and time;</L>
<L>May stride with seven-leagu'd boots, from shore to shore,</L>
<L>And, nobly by transgressing, charm you more.</L>
<L>Alas! our Author dares not laugh at schools,</L>
<L>Plain sense confines his humbler Muse to rules.</L>
<L>Form'd on the classic scale his structures rise,</L>
<L>He shifts no scenes to dazzle and surprize.</L>
<L>In one poor garden's solitary grove,</L>
<L>Like the primaeval pair, his lovers rove.</L>
<L>And in due time will each transaction pass,</L>
<L>— Unless some hasty critic shakes the glass.</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. As it is spoken by Mr. GARRICK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SUCCESS makes people vain.—The maxim's true.—</L>
<L>We all confess it— and not over new.</L>
<L>The veriest clown, who stumps along the streets,</L>
<L>And doffs his hat to each grave cit he meets,</L>
<L>Some twelvemonths hence, bedaub'd with livery lace,</L>
<L>Shall thrust his saucy flambeau in your face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so our Bard—though twice your kind applause</L>
<L>Has, on this fickle spot, espous'd his cause:</L>

<L>May stride, with seven-leagu'd boots, from shore to shore,</L>
<L>And, nobly by transgressing, charm ye more.</L>
<L>Alas! our Author dares not laugh at schools —</L>
<L>Plain sense confines his humbler Muse to rules:</L>
<L>He shifts no scenes—But here I stop'd him short —</L>
<L>Not change your scenes? said I, — I'm sorry for't:</L>
<L>My constant friends above, around, below,</L>
<L>Have English tastes, and love both change and show▪</L>
<L>Without such aids, even Shakespear would be flat —</L>
<L>Our crouded Pantomimes are proofs of that.</L>
<L>What eager transport stares from every eye,</L>
<L>When pullies rattle, and our Genii fly!</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>When tin cascades like falling waters gleam:</L>
<L>Or through the canvas—bursts the real stream:</L>
<L>While thirsty Islington laments in vain</L>
<L>Half her New-River roll'd to Drury-Lane.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord, Sir, said I, for gallery, boxes, pit,</L>
<L>I'll back my Harlequin against your wit—</L>
<L>Yet still the Author, anxious for his play,</L>
<L>Shook his wise head—What will the critics say?</L>
<L>As usual, Sir—abuse you all they can!—</L>
<L>And what the ladies—He's a charming man!</L>
<L>A charming piece!—One scarce knows what it means;</L>
<L>But that's no matter—where there's such sweet scenes!</L>
<L>Still he persists—and let him—<HI>entre nous</HI>—</L>
<L>I know your tastes, and will indulge 'em too.</L>
<L>Change you shall have; so set your hearts at ease:</L>
<L>Write as <HI>he</HI> will, we'll act it as <HI>you</HI> please.</L>

<P>BUT madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir! what can possibly have alarmed you thus? You see me quite unconcerned. I only tell you in a plain simple narrative manner — (this plaguy thread) — and merely by way of conver∣sation, that you are in love with Caelia; and where is the mighty harm in all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The harm in it, madam! have I not told you a
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
thousand and a thousand times that you were the only woman who could possibly make me happy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why aye, to be sure you have, and sworn a thousand and a thousand oaths to confirm that as∣sertion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And am not I here now expressly to marry you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that <HI>too</HI> is true—but—you are in love with Caelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, madam, what can I say to you? If it had not been for my attendance upon you, I had never known Caelia or her mother either, though they are both my relations. The mother has since indeed put some kind of confidence in me; she is a widow you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And wants consolation! The poor orphan too her daughter! Well, charity is an excellent virtue. I never considered it in that light before. You are vastly charitable, Mr. Modely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible to talk with you.—If you will not do me justice, do it to yourself at least. Is there any comparison betwixt you and Caelia? Could any man of sense hesitate a moment? She has yet no character. One does not know what she is, or what she will be; a chit, a green girl of fourteen or fifteen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seventeen at least.—(I cannot undo this knot.)—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let her be seventeen. Would any man of
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
judgment attach himself to a girl of that age? O' my soul, if one was to make love to her, she would hardly understand what one meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Girls are not quite so ignorant as you may ima∣gine, Mr. Modely; Caelia will understand you, take my word for it, and does understand you. As to your men of judgment and sense, here is my brother now; I take him to be full as reasonable as yourself, and somewhat older; and yet with all his philosophy, he has brought himself to a de∣termination at last, to fulfill the father's will, and marry this green girl. I am sorry to tell you so, Mr. Modely, but he will certainly marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him marry her. I should perhaps do it my∣self, if I was in his place. He was an intimate friend of her father's. She is a great fortune, and was given to him by will. But do you imagine, my dear Araminta, that if he was left to his own choice, without any bias, he would not rather have a woman nearer his own years? He might al∣most be her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true. But you will find it difficult to persuade me, that youth in a woman is so insur∣mountable an objection. I fancy, Mr. Modely, it may be got over. Suppose I leave you to think of it.—(I cannot get this right.)—
<STAGE>Going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, dear Araminta, why will you plague me thus? Your own charms, my earnestness, might prove to you —</P>

<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you I don't want proofs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, you shall have none then. But give me leave to hope, since you have done me the honour to be a little uneasy on my account —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Uneasy!—I uneasy!— What does the man mean? I was a little concerned indeed to give you uneasiness by informing you of my brother's in∣tended marriage with Caelia. But—(this shuttle bends so abominably.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou perplexing tyrant! Nay, you shall not go.—May I continue to adore you! you must not forbid me that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part I neither command nor forbid any thing. Only this I would have you remember, I have quick eyes. Your servant.—(I wish this knotting had never come in fashion.)</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit Araminta.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quick eyes indeed! I thought my cunning here had been a master piece. The girl cannot have told sure! and the mother is entirely on my side. They certainly were those inquisitive eyes she speaks of, which have found out this secret. Well, I must be more cautious for the future, and act the lover to Araminta ten times stronger than ever. One would not give her up till one was sure of suc∣ceeding in the other place.</P>

<P>How came I here? — How came you here— if you come to that? A man can't retire from the noise and bustle of the world, to admire the beauties of the spring, and read pastoral in an arbour, but impertinent lovers must disturb his meditations.— Thou art the errantest hypocrite, Modely —</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hypocrite!—My dear friend, we men of gal∣lantry must be so.—But have a care, we may have other listeners for aught I know, who may not be so proper for confidantes.
<STAGE>Looking about.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be easy on that head. We have the garden to ourselves. The widow and her daughter are just gone in, and Sir John is busy with his steward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The widow, and her daughter! Why, were they in the garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>They just came into it, but upon seeing you and Araminta together, they turned back again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>On seeing me and Araminta? I hope I have no jealousies there too. However I am glad Caelia knows I am in the garden, because it may probably induce her to fall in my way, by chance you know, and give me an opportunity of talking to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think she likes you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She does not know what she does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you like her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, I think I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then do you pursue your affair with Ara∣minta? and not find some honourable means of breaking off with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That might not be quite so expedient. I think Araminta the finest woman, and Caelia the prettiest girl I know. Now they are both good fortunes, and one of them I am resolved to have, but which —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your great wisdom has not yet determined. Thou art undoubtedly the vainest fellow living.— I thought you brought me down here now to your wedding?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Egad I thought so too, but this plaguy little rustic has disconcerted all my schemes. Sir John, you know, by her father's will, may marry her if he pleases, and she forfeits her estate if she marries any one else. Now I am contriving to bring it about, that I may get her, and her fortune too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very likely business, truly. So you modestly expect that Sir John Dorilant should give up his mistress, and then throw her fortune into the bat∣gain, as an additional reward to the obliging man who has seduced her from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum! why I don't expect quite that. But you know, Belmour, he is a man of honour, and would not force her inclinations tho' he loved her to dis∣traction. —Come, come, he is quite a different creature from what you and I are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak for yourself, good Sir; yet why should you imagine that her inclinations are not as likely to fix upon him as you? He has a good person, and is scarce older than yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That shews your ignorance; I am ten years younger than he is. My dress and the company I keep, give a youth and vivacity to me, which he must always want. An't I a man of the town? O that town, Belmour! Could I but have met these ladies there, I had done the business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were they never there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.—Sir Harry Beverley, the father of this girl, lived always in the country, and divided his time between his books and his hounds. His wife and daughter seldom mixed with people of their own rank, but at a horse-race, or a rural visit. And see the effects! The girl, tho' she is naturally genteel, has an air of simplicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not want sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no!—She has a devilish deal of that kind of sense, which is acquired by early reading. I have heard her talk occasionally, like a queen in a tragedy, or at least like a sentimental lady in a comedy,
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
much above your misses of thirty in town, I assure you.—As to the mother—But she is a charac∣ter, and explains herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I have read her. But pray how came it to pass, that the father, who was of a different way of thinking in regard to party, should have left Sir John guardian to his daughter, with the addi∣tional clause too, of her being obliged to marry him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is somewhat surprizing. But the truth of the case was, they were thoroughly acquainted, and each considered party as the foible of the other. Sir Harry thought a good husband his daughter's best security for happiness, and he knew it was im∣possible Sir John Dorilant should prove a bad one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this prospect of happiness would you destroy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; I only see farther than Sir Harry did, and would increase that happiness, by giving her a better husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! your humble servant, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, the mother is entirely in my interest, and by the by has a hankering after Sir John herself. <Q>He is a sober man, and should have a woman of discretion for his wife, not a hoydening girl.</Q>— 'Egad, Belmour, suppose you attacked the widow? The woman is young enough, and has an excellent jointure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so became your father-in-law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will have an admirable opportunity to∣night; we are to have the fiddles you know, and you may dance with her.</P>
<P>When musick softens, and when dancing fires! Eh! Belmour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are vastly kind to Sir John, and would ease him I find of both his mistresses. But suppose this man of honour should be fool enough to resign his mistress, may not another kind of honour oblige him to run you through the body for deserting his sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, it may. However, it is not the first duel I have fought on such an occasion, so I am his man. Not that it is impossible but he may have scruples there too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't think him a coward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know he is not. But your reasoning men have strange distinctions. They are quite different crea∣tures, as I told you, from you and I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are pleased to compliment. But suppose now, as irrational as you think me, I should find out a means to make this whole affair easy to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not by attacking the widow, but by making my addresses in good earnest to Araminta.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I forbid that absolutely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, do you think it possible I should suc∣ceed after the accomplished Mr. Modely?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith between you and I, I think not, but I don't chuse to hazard it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you love her still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it is nothing upon earth but that insati∣able vanity of yours, with a little tincture of ava∣rice, that leads you a gadding thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I plead guilty. But be it as it will, I am deter∣mined to pursue my point. And see where the little rogue comes most opportunely. I told you she would be here. Go, go, Belmour, you must not listen to all my love scenes.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do lovers ever change?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not those who feel a real passion. But there are false alarms in love, which the unpractised heart sometimes mistakes for true ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were yours such for Araminta?</P>

<P>Do you hope I should not marry her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure I do. I would not have the poor lady deceived, and I would willingly have a better opinion of Mr. Modely than to believe him ca∣pable of making false protestations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To you he never could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me?—I am out of the question.—But I am sorry for Araminta, for I believe she loves you.</P>

<P>If you can pity those who love in vain, why am not I an object of compassion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mr. Modely, why will you talk thus? My hand, you know, is destined to Sir John Do∣rilant,
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
and my duty there does not even permit me to think of other lovers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy, happy man! Yet give me leave to ask one question, madam.—I dread to do it, tho' my last glimpse of happiness depends upon your answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What question?—Nay, pray speak, I intreat it of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then tell me, lovely Caelia, sincerely tell me, were your choice left free, and did it depend upon you only to determine who should be the master of your affections, might I expect one favourable thought?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(after some hesitation.)</STAGE>
<P>It—it does not depend upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it does not, but if it did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Mr. Modely, I cannot talk upon this subject. Impossibilities are impossibilities. — But I hope you will acquaint Araminta instantly with this change in your inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would do it, but I dare not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You should break it first to Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My difficulty does not lie in the breaking it; but if I confess my passion at an end, I must no longer expect admittance into this family, and I could still wish to talk to Caelia as a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Mr. Modely, I should be loth myself to lose your acquaintance; but — O here comes my mama, she may put you in a method.</P>

<P>Well, well, if that be all, I may perhaps help you out, and break it to Sir John myself.—Not that I approve of roving affections I assure you.</P>

<P>Mr. Modely as a husband! Why surely madam, Sir John —</P>

<P>Fiddle faddle Sir John; Sir John knows better things than to plague himself with a wife in lead∣ing strings.</P>

<P>O ho! would you be glad to have me sure of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I don't know what I should be glad of. I would not give Sir John a moment's pain to be mistress of the whole world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if it should be brought about without giv∣ing him pain. Hey! Caelia—

<P>I should be sorry for it.</P>

<P>For then he must think lightly of me.</P>

<P>What does the girl mean? Come, come, I must enter roundly into this affair. Here, here, sit down, and tell me plainly and honestly without equivoca∣tion or reservation, is Modely indifferent to you? Nay, nay,—look me in the face; turn your eyes to∣wards me. One judges greatly by the eyes, espe∣cially in a woman.

<P>When Sir John Dorilant talks to me, my heart is softened but not perplexed. My esteem, my gratitude overflows towards him. I consider him as a kinder father, with all the tenderness without the authority.</P>

<P>But when Mr. Modely talks?</P>

<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Madam, there are a thousand obstacles. —I am afraid Sir John loves me; I am sure he esteems me, and I would not forfeit his esteem for the universe. I am certain I can make him an af∣fectionate and an humble wife, and I think I can forget Mr. Modely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forget a fiddle! Don't talk to me of forgetting. I order you on your duty not to forget. Mr. Modely is, and shall be the man. You may trust my prudence for bringing it about. I will talk with Sir John instantly.—I know what you are going to say, but I will not hear a word of it. Can you imagine, Caelia, that I shall do any thing but with the utmost decency and decorum?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you will not, madam; but there are de∣licacies —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>With which I am unacquainted to be sure, and my daughter must instruct me in them. Pray, Caelia, where did you learn this nicety of sentiments? Who was it that inspired them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the maxims of the world —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are altered, I suppose, since I was of your age. Poor thing, what world hast thou seen? Notwith∣standing your delicacies and your maxims, Sir John perhaps may be wiser than you imagine, and chuse a wife of somewhat more experience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>May he be happy wherever he chuses.—But dear madam —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again? don't make me angry. I will positively not be instructed. Ay, you may well blush.— Nay, no tears—Come, come, Caelia, I forgive you. I had idle delicacies myself once. Lard! I remember when your poor papa —he, he, he— but we have no time for old stories. What would you say now if Sir John himself should propose it, and persuade the match, and yet continue as much your friend as ever, nay become more so, a nearer friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>In such a case, madam —</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I understand you, and will about it instantly. B'ye Caelia; O how its little heart flutters!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit Lady.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does indeed. A nearer friend? I hardly know whether I should wish her success or not — Sir John is so affectionate. Would I had never seen Mr. Modely! —Araminta too! what will she say? — O I see a thousand bad consequences. I must follow her, and prevent them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRITHEE don't teize me so; I vow, cousin Modely, you are almost as peremptory as my daughter. She truly was teaching me decorum just now, and plaguing me with her delicacies, and her stuff. I tell you Sir John will be in the gar∣den immediately, this is always his hour of walk∣ing: and when he comes, I shall lay the whole affair before him, with all its concatenation of cir∣cumstances, and I warrant you bring it about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt, madam, of the transcendency of your ladyship's rhetorick; it is on that I entirely rely. But I must beg leave to hint, that Araminta already suspects my passion, and should it be openly declared, would undoubtedly prevail that instant with her brother to forbid me the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that might be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And tho' I told your daughter I did not care how soon it came to an eclaircisment, yet a woman of your ladyship's penetration and knowledge of
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
the world, must see the necessity of concealing it, at least for a time. I beg pardon for offering what may have even the distant appearance of instruction. But it is Sir John's delicacy which must be princi∣pally alarmed with apprehensions of her disregard for him; and I am sure your ladyship's manner of doing it, will shew him where he might much better place his affections, and with an undoubted prospect of happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now you talk to the purpose.—But stay, is not that Sir John coming this way?—It is I vow, and Araminta with him. We'll turn down this walk, and reason the affair a little more, and then I will come round the garden upon him.</P>
<STAGE>Modely takes her hand to lead her out.</STAGE>
<P>You are very gallant, cousin Modely.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you drag me into the garden for? We were private enough where we were—and I hate walking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me, my dear sister; I am restless every where, my head and heart are full of nothing but this lovely girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, dear brother, you are enough to spoil any woman in the universe. I tell you again and again, the girl is a good girl, an excellent girl, and will make an admirable wife. You may trust one woman in her commendations of another; we are
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
not apt to be too favourable in our judgments, especially when there is beauty in the case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You charm me when you talk thus. If she is really all this, how happy must the man be who can engage her affections. But alas! Araminta, in every thing which regards me, it is duty, not love, which actuates her behaviour. She steals away my very soul by her attentions, but never once expresses that heart-felt tenderness, those sym∣pathetic feelings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha—ha — ha!—O my stars!— Sympathetic feelings!—Why, would you have a girl of her age have those sympathetic feelings, as you call them! If she had, take my word for it, she would coquet it with half the fellows in town before she had been married a twelvemonth. Besides, Sir John, you don't consider that you was her father's friend; she has been accustomed from her infancy to respect you in that light; and our fathers friends, you know, are always old people, grey beards, philoso∣phers, enemies to youth, and the destruction of gayety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I was never such.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may imagine so; but you always had a grave turn. I hated you once myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Araminta!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did as I hope to live; for many a time has your aversion to dancing hindered me from having a fiddle.—By the by, remember we are to have the fiddles
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
to-night.—But let that pass: As the case now stands, if I was not already so near akin to you, you have the temper in the world which I should chuse in a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN</SPEAKER>
<P>That is obliging, however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so very obliging perhaps neither. It would be merely for my own sake, for then would I have the appearance of the most obedient sympathetic wife in the universe, and yet be as despotic in my govern∣ment as an eastern monarch. And when I grew tired, as I probably should do, of a want of contradiction, why, I should find an easy remedy for that too— I could break your heart in about a month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't trifle with me, 'tis your serious advice I want; give it me honestly as a friend, and ten∣derly as a sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I have done it, fifty times. What can I say more? If you will have it again you must. This then it is in plain terms.—But you are sure you are heartily in love with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, that we will take for granted; and now you want to know what is right and proper for you to do in the case. Why, was I in your place, I should make but short work with it. She knows the circumstances of her father's will, therefore, would I go immediately to her, tell her how my heart stood inclined, and hope she had no objections to comply, with what it is not in her power to refuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would not have me talk thus abruptly to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I would. It will save a world of trouble. She will blush perhaps at first, and look a little aukward, (and by the by so will you too); but if she is the girl I take her for, after a little irresolute gesture, and about five minutes conversation, she will drop you a curtesy with the demure humility of a Vestal, and tell you it shall be as you and her mama pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that it were come to that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray what hinders it? Nothing upon earth but your consummate prudence and discretion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think of marrying her, till I am sure she loves me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lud, Lud!—why what does that signify? If she consents is not that enough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her gratitude may induce her to consent, rather than make me unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would absolutely make a woman mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, could you think of marrying a man who had no regard for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And could you then?</P>

<P>Uncommon ones indeed.</P>

<P>Madam!</P>

<P>I say, Sir, John we must pardon the sailings of our deceased friends. Indeed his affection for his child excuses it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuses it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeed does it. His fondness for her might naturally make him wish to place her with a person of your known excellence of character; for my own part, had I died, I should have wished it myself.—I don't believe you have your equal in the world.— Nay, dear Sir John, 'tis no compliment.—This I say might make him not attend to the impropriety of the thing, and the reluctance a gentleman of your good sense and judgment must undoubtedly have to accede to so unsuitable a treaty. Especially as he could not but know there were women of discre∣tion in the world, who would be proud of an al∣liance where the prospect of felicity, was so inviting and unquestionable.</P>

<SP>

<P>Dear Sir John!—You put such peremptory ques∣tions, you might easily understand what one meant methinks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, madam, I must speak plain at once.— Know then, my heart, my soul, my every thought of happiness is fixed upon that lovely girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O astonishing! Well, miracles are not ceased, that's certain. But every body, they say, must do a foolish
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
thing once in their lives.—And can you really and seriously think of putting Sir Harry's will in execution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I could!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure the girl has a fine fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortune! I despise it. I would give it with all my soul to any one who could engage me her af∣fections.—Fortune! dirt.</P>

<P>I am thunderstruck! —</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Turning eagerly to her.)</STAGE>
<P>O madam, tell me, sincerely tell me, what me∣thod can I possibly pursue to make her think fa∣vourably of me! You know her inmost soul, you know the tender moments of address, the easy avenues to her unpractised heart. Be kind, and point them out.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow, Sir John, I don't know what to say to you. — Let go my hand. — You talked of my disconcerting you just now, I am sure you dis∣concert me with a witness.—
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
I did not think the man had so much rapture in him. He squeezed my hand with such an emphasis! I may gain him perhaps at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why will you not speak, madam? Can you see me on the brink of desperation, and not lend a friend∣ly hand to my assistance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have it.—
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
—Alas, Sir John, what
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
signifies what I can do! Can I answer for the incli∣nations of a giddy girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know she is not such; her innocent mind is yet untainted with the follies of her sex. And if a life devoted to her service, without a wish but what regards her happiness, can win her to be mine —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that might go a great way with an unpre∣judiced mind. But when a first passion has taken place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(With amazement.)</STAGE>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the truth, I am afraid the girl is not so untainted as you imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You distract me. — How—when — whom can she have seen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly there is a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me who, that I may — No, that I may give her to him, and make her happy whatever be∣comes of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is generous indeed.—So — so.
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But 'tis impossible. I have observed all her mo∣tions, all her attentions, with a lover's eye incapa∣ble of erring.—Yet stay— has any body written to her?</P>

<P>Confusion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I was going to offer some proposals to you, but your strange declaration stopped me short.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You proposals? —You?—Are you her a better in the affair? — O madam, what un∣pardonable crime have I committed against you, that you should thus conspire my ruin? Have not I always behaved to you like a friend, a brother? — I will not call you ungrateful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on us! —The man raves.— How could it possibly enter into my head, or the girl's either, that you had any serious thoughts of marrying her? But I see you are too much discomposed at present, to admit of calm reasoning. So I shall take some other opportunity.—Friend—Brother — Un∣grateful!—Marry come up!— I hope, at least, you will not think of forcing the poor girl's inclinations! Ungrateful indeed!
<STAGE>Exit in a passion.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for the universe.—Stay, madam.—She is gone.— But it is no matter. I am but little dis∣posed for altercation now. Heigh ho! —Good heaven! can so slight an intercourse have effected all this? — I have scarce ever seen them together. O that I had been born with Belmour's happy ta∣lents of address. — Address!— 'tis absolute ma∣gick, 'tis fascination — Alas! 'tis the rapidity of real passion. — Why did Modely bring him hither to his wedding? Every thing has conspired against me. He brought him, and the delay of the lawyers has kept him here. Had I taken Araminta's advice a poor fortnight ago, it had not been in the power of fate to have undone me. — And yet she might
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
have seen him afterwards, which would at least have made her duty uneasy to her.—Heigh ho!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>She did not absolutely mention his name, but I

In the mean time, Sir John, I have the satisfaction of acquainting you, that my affair, with Araminta's leave, draws very near a conclusion. The lawyers have finished their papers, and I only now wait for your perusal of them.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mr. Modely, you shall not wait a moment for me. I will dispatch them instantly. I feel the

want of happiness too severely myself, to postpone it in others. I leave you with my sister; when she names the day, you may depend upon my concur∣rence.

<P>Why, don't you know that I know—</P>

<P>I cannot help a lady's knowledge or imagina∣tions. All I know is, that it is in your power to make me either the happiest or most miserable man in the whole creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, this is astonishing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, madam, that any unguarded behavi∣our of mine, any little playful gallantries, should have occasioned surmises, which—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Serious, as I hope to live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not enough to make one serious, when the woman one has pursued for years, almost with ado∣ration, is induced by mere appearances to doubt
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
the honourableness of one's intentions. Have you not heard me this moment apply to your brother, even in the midst of his uneasiness.—I little ex∣pected where the difficulty would lie.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, well, poor thing, I won't teize it any lon∣ger; here, there, take my hand.</P>

<P>To-morrow, then, my angel, be the day. O Araminta, I cannot speak my transport.—And did you really think that I was in love with Caelia?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as a proof of my future sincerity, I must confess I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I wonder how you could.</P>

<P>Why, yes, I think I am.—But what can my brother mean about Belmour?</P>

<P>It is some trick of the widow's.</P>
</SP>

<P>I dare say she meant you.</P>

<P>Possibly she might; you know her motives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, yes, her passion for my brother is pretty no∣torious. But the wretch will be mistaken.—To∣morrow, you say?</P>

<P>To-morrow, my adorable.</P>
</SP>

<P>It shall be as you please.—But my situation is so terribly aukward, that I must break from you. Adieu!
<STAGE>Exit Araminta.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul she is a fine woman; and loves me to distraction; and what is still more, I most un∣doubtedly love her.—I have a good mind to take her.—Yet not to have it in my power to suc∣ceed in the other place, would call my parts in question.—No, no; — I must not disparage my parts neither.—In order to be a great character, one should go as near being a rogue as possible. I have a philosopher's opinion on my side in that, and the practice of half the heroes and politicians in Europe.</P>

<SPEAKER>BELMOUR</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(alone.)</STAGE>
<P>CAELIA in love with me! Egad the thing is not impossible; my friend Modely may have been a little mistaken. Sir John was very serious when he told me of it; and though I protested to him that I had never made the least advances, he still persisted in his opinion.—The girl must have have told him so herself.—Let me recollect a little. —She is always extremely civil to me; but that indeed she is to every body.—I do not remember any thing particular in her looks; but I shall watch them more narrowly the next time I see her.—She is very handsome; and yet in my opi∣nion, notwithstanding Modely's infidelity, Ara∣minta is much the finer woman.—Suppose— No, that will not do.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> MODELY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so, Mr. Belmour, I imagined I should find you here; this is the lover's corner. We have all had our reveries in it. But why don't you talk louder, man? You ought, at least, to give me my revenge in that. My soliloquies, you know, are easily over-heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never designedly over-heard them, Mr. Modely; nor did I make any improper use of the accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grave, very grave, and perfectly moral! And so this is all I am to have for the loss of my mis∣tress.—Heigh ho!</P>
<Q><L>Then I must be content to see her bless</L>
<L>Yon happier youth.—</L></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your raillery is a little unseasonable, Mr. Mode∣ly; for to speak plainly, I begin to suspect that this is some trick of yours, to dupe me as well as Sir John Dorilant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour, no, if we must be serious: it may be a mistake, but not intended on my side, I can assure you. Come, come, if the girl really likes you, take her. If I should prove the happy man, give me joy, and there's an end of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy you are used to disappointments in love, they sit so easy upon you. Or rather I should sup∣pose, in this case, you are pretty sure of your ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither, upon my soul; but a certain <HI>Je ne scai quoy,</HI> a <HI>Gayete de Coeur</HI> which carries me above misfortunes: some people call it vanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are not absolutely mistaken. But what becomes of Araminta all this while?</P>
</SP>

<STAGE>(yawning.)</STAGE>
<P>I shall marry her, I believe, to-morrow.</P>

<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir John is at this very moment looking over the settlements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet it is pretty plain, methinks. I tell you I am to be married to-morrow. Was it not time to make sure of one mistress, when you was running away with the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I have no such intentions.—But are you really serious? Have you laid aside your designs upon Caelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so, neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean then by your marriage with Araminta? Why won't you unriddle this affair to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Because it is at present a riddle to myself, and I expect lady Beverley here every moment to resolve the enigma.</P>
</SP>

<P>Was it a scheme of her's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ha! ha! ha! or else you fight me, I suppose. Why, so you may; and so may Sir John Dorilant too, and faith with some colour of reason.

</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LADY BEVERLEY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear cousin Modely, I am all over in an agita∣tion; we shall certainly be discovered; that devil Araminta —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of her, madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is now with her brother talking so eagerly— Oh! I saw the villainous changes in her counte∣nance; I would have given the world to have over∣heard their conversation.—Come, come, you must advise me instantly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ladyship must first let me into the secret. I am absolutely in a wood with regard to the whole affair. What is all this of Caelia and Belmour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, nothing at all; an errant dilemma of the foolish man's own making, which his imper∣tinent sister will immediately clear up to him, and then all must out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came Belmour ever to be mentioned in the case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, dear, he never was mentioned. I must confess that I was so provoked with Sir John's un∣natural behaviour, that I could not help telling him that Caelia had a lover, and in the house too. Your situation with regard to Araminta made him never dream of you, and consequently all his suspicions turned on Belmour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you did not say that that lover had made his addresses to Caelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what I might say; for he used me like a Turk. But whatever I said I can unsay it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if I might venture to advice a person of your lady's sagacity —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O ay, with all my heart, cousin Modely. For though I may say it without vanity, that nobody has a more clear apprehension of things when the mental faculty is totally undisturbed; yet, when I am in a trepidation, nobody upon earth can be more glad of advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, madam, to speak with reverence, I should hope your ladyship would see the necessity of keeping me as concealed as possible. It is the young lady's passion, not mine, which must have the principal influence. Sir John Dorilant's pecu∣liarity of temper is such—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, he has peculiarity enough, that's cer∣tain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it is there, madam, as the weakest part, that our attack will be the surest. If she confesses an inclination for me, not both the Indies, added to her fortune, could induce him to marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is honourable, however, cousin Modely. But he is a horrid creature, notwithstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it, madam; but a failure in an improper pursuit may recal his reason, and, as he does not want understanding, teach him to search for hap∣piness where only it is to be expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He! he! I am so angry with him at present, that I really believe I should refuse him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ladyship must not be too cruel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I confess it is not in my nature; but— bless me, here they come.—Let us run down this walk directly, for they must not see us to∣gether.

<P>Come along, I say, you dragged me into the garden just now, and I will command in my turn. Talk to her you must, and shall. The girl has sense and spirit when she is disengaged from that

horrid mother of her's; and I have told her you wanted her, and in this very spot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You cannot feel, Araminta, what you make me suffer. But sooner or later it must come to this, and therefore I will assume a resolution, and be rid of all my doubts at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, this nonsense about Belmour is merely a phantom of her mother's raising, to sound your intentions, and promote her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus far is certain, that Belmour disclaims all knowledge of the affair, and with an appearance of sincerity; but even that is doubtful. Besides, they are not his, but her inclinations which give me any concern. It is the heart I require. The life∣less form, beauteous as it is, would only elude my grasp; the shadow of a joy, not the reality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, dear, that men had but a little common sense; or that one could venture to tell them what one knows of one's own sex! I have a good mind to be honest.—As I live, the girl is coming. —I'll speed her on the way. Courage, brother, Voila!

<STAGE>Half aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me beg of you, sir, to ask it freely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then — is your heart your own?</P>
<P>O Caelia, that hesitation confirms my fears. You cannot answer in the affirmative, and have too much humanity for what I feel, to add to my torments. —Good God! — and is it possible, that an acquaint∣ance of a few days, should entirely obliterate the at∣tentive assiduity, the tender anxieties which I have shewn for years!—But I understand it all too well. Mine were the aweful, though heart-felt attentions of a parent; his, the sprightly address of a presum∣ing lover. His easy assurance has won upon your affections, and what I thought <HI>my</HI> greatest merit, has undone me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were so good, sir, a little while ago, to pity
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
my confusion; pity it now, and whilst I lay my heart open before you, be again that kind, that ge∣nerous friend, which I have always found you.</P>
</SP>

<P>Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in vain for me to dissemble an ignorance of your meaning, nor would I if I could. I own I have been too much pleased with Mr. Modely's conver∣sation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Modely's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me go on.—His intended marriage with Araminta, gave him a freedom in this family which it was not my business to restrain. His attentions to my mother, and the friendly manner in which he executed some commissions of consequence to her, gave him frequent opportunities of talking to me. I will confess too, that his appearance and his man∣ner struck me. But I was so convinced of his real passion for Araminta, that I never dreamt of the least attachment to me, till—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Till what, when— Modely?—Why, he is to be married to my sister to-morrow or next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it was so intended, but his behaviour this morning, and the intercessions of my mother, had, I own, won upon me strangely, and induced me to believe that I only was the object of his pursuits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am thunderstruck! —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mother made me clearly perceive that the
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
completion of his marriage would be an injury to Araminta. She told me too, sir, that you yourself would be my adviser in the affair, and even per∣suad me to accept it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O the malicious woman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that indeed I perceive she greatly erred. And I only mean this as a confession of what is past, and of what is now at an end for ever.—For the fu∣ture, I give myself to your guidance alone, and am what you direct.—
<STAGE>Giving her hand to him.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou amiable softness! —No, Caelia, how∣ever miserable I may be myself, I will not make you so; it was your heart, not your hand I aspired to. As the former has been seduced from me, it would be an injustice to us both to accept of the latter. As to Mr. Modely, and Lady Beverley, I have not deserved this treachery from them, and they shall both feel my resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>She told me indeed there was a favoured lover, and my suspicions fell very naturally upon Belmour. Nay, even now, nothing but that lovely sincerity— which undoes me—could make me credit this vil∣lainy of Modely.—O Caelia! what a heart have I lost!</P>

<P>My artifices! Mrs. Araminta.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Your artifices, lady Beverley; but they are all to no purpose; the girl has too good an understand∣ing to be imposed upon any longer; and your boast∣ed

<P>What does the woman mean? But the loss of a lover, I suppose, is an excuse for ill-breeding! Poor creature! if the petulancy of thy temper would let me, I could almost pity thee. The loss of a lover is no agreeable thing; but women at our time of life, Mrs. Araminta, must not expect a lasting pas∣sion.</P>

<P>Scarce any at all I believe, if they go a wooing themselves. For my part, I have had the satisfac∣tion of being sollicited however.

<P>Marry her, my dear Araminta? Can you think it possible, that I should have so preposterous a thought? No, my behaviour shall deserve her, but not over-rule her inclinations. Were I to seize the tender opportunity of her present disposition, the world would ascribe it to her fortune; and I am sure my deceased and valuable friend, however kindly he meant to me in the affair, never intend∣ed that I should make his daughter unhappy.</P>

<P>To shew how mistaken you are in all this, I have given him up totally. I despise, and hate him; nay I am upon the brink of a resolution to give myself to another.

I am, I assure you; his friend Mr. Belmour is by no means indifferent on my subject.</P>

<P>And is this revenge on yourself, a proof of your want of passion for him?—Ah Araminta!—Come, come, my dear, I own I think him unworthy of you, and would resent his usage to the utmost, did not I clearly perceive that it would appear mercenary in myself, and give real pain both to you and Caelia.</P>

<P>Nay, Sir John, to be sure I am not afraid of trust∣ing my daughter alone with you. A man of your discretion will undoubtedly be guilty of no impro∣priety.

<P>Now, Caelia, we are alone, and I have many excuses to make to you for the impassioned sallies of our late conversation; which I do most sincere∣ly.—Can you pardon them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, 'tis I who ought to intreat for pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, madam, I have no blame to cast upon you for any part of your conduct. Your youth and inexperience, joined to the goodness of your heart, are sufficient apologies for any shadow of indiscretion which might appear in your behavi∣our. I am afraid mine was not so irreproachable. However, Caelia, I shall endeavour to make you all the amends in my power; and to shew you that
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
it is your happiness, not my own, which is the ob∣ject of my anxiety.</P>
<P>Your father's will is but too clear in its inten∣tions. But the purity of his heart never meant to promote my felicity at the expence of yours. You are therefore, madam, entirely at liberty from this moment, to make your choice where you please. This paper will entitle you to that authority, and this will enable you to bestow your fortune where you bestow your hand.—Take them, my dear! —Why are you so disturbed?—Alas, Caelia, I see too plainly the cause of these emotions. You only wish the happy man to whom you have given your heart, loved you as I do!—</P>
<P>But I beg pardon; and will only add one cau∣tion, which my duty demands of me, as your guardian, your protector, and your father's friend. —You have been a witness of Modely's transacti∣ons with my sister. Have a care therefore, Caelia; be sure of his firm attachment before you let your own hurry you into a compliance. These papers give you up all power on my part; but as an ad∣viser, I shall be always ready to be consulted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My tears and my confusion have hitherto hin∣dered me from answering; not the invidious sug∣gestion which you have so cruelly charged me with. What friend, what lover have I, to engross my at∣tentions? I never had but one, and he has cast me off for ever.—O, Sir, give me the papers, and let me return them where my soul longs to place them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Caelia, to accept them again, would im∣peach the justice of my whole proceeding. It
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
would make it look like the mean artifice of a mercenary villain, who attempted to gain by stra∣tagem what his merits did not entitle him to.— I blush to think of it.—I have performed my office. Be mistress of yourself, and let me fly from a com∣bat to which I find myself unequal.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU find, Mr. Belmour, that I have seen your partialities, and like a woman of ho∣nour I have confessed my own. Your behaviour to your friend is generous beyond comparison, and I could almost join in the little stratagem you pro∣pose, merely to see if he deserves it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, you mistake him utterly. Vanity is his ruling vice; an idle affectation of suc∣cess among the ladies, which makes fools admire, and boys envy him, is the master passion of his giddy heart. The severe checks he has met with to-day, have sufficiently opened his understanding; and the real possession of one valuable woman, whom he dreads to lose, will soon convince him how de∣spicable his folly has made him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, Mr. Belmour, a man who has half his life been pursuing bubbles, without perceiving their insignificance, will be easily tempted to re∣sume
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
the chace. The possession of one reality will hardly convince him that the rest were shadows. And a woman must be an ideot indeed, who thinks of fixing a man to herself after marriage, whom she could not secure before it. To begin with in∣sensibility, O fie, Mr. Modely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not fear it, madam; his heart—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is as idle as our conversation on the subject. I beg your pardon for the comparison; as I do, for having sent for you in this manner. But I thought it necessary that both you and Mr. Modely should know my real sentiments, undisguised by passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And may I hope you will concur in my proposal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to say to it, it is a piece of mummery which I am ill suited for at present. But if an opportunity should offer, I must confess I have enough of the woman in me, not to be insen∣sible to the charms of an innocent revenge.—But this other intricate business, if you can assist me in that, you will oblige me beyond measure. There are two hearts, Mr. Belmour, worthy to be united! Had my brother a little less honour, and she a little less sensibility—But I know not what to think of it.</P>

<P>Honour, Mr. Modely! 'tis a sacred word. You ought to shudder when you pronounce it. Honour has no existence but in the breast of truth. 'Tis the harmonious result of every virtue combined. — You have sense, you have knowledge; but I can as∣sure you, Mr. Modely, tho' parts and knowledge, without the dictates of justice, or the feelings of hu∣manity, may make a bold and mischievous member of society even courted by the world, they only, in my eye, make him more contemptible.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, Sir, 'tis more; 'tis real unaffected passion. Her innocent soul speaks through her eyes the honest dictates of her heart. In our last conference, notwithstanding her mother's com∣mands; notwithstanding, what I blush to own, my utmost ardent solicitations to the contrary, she persisted in her integrity, tore the papers which left her choice free, and treated us with an indig∣nation which added charms to virtue.</P>

<P>I shall declare nothing, Sir John, on that sub∣ject: what I have to say is of a very different im∣port. — In short, without circumlocution, or
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
any unnecessary embarrassment to entangle the af∣fair, I and my daughter are of an opinion, that it is by no means proper for us to continue any longer in your family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is what I had to declare, Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does Caelia, madam, desire to leave me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a proposal of her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confusion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a very sensible one too, in my opinion. For when people are not so easy together, as might be expected, I know no better remedy than parting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Sure, this is no trick of Modely's, to get her away from me?—He talked too himself, of leav∣ing my family immediately.—I shall relapse again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, Sir John, you are somewhat disconcert∣ed: but, for my part —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O torture!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, for my part, Sir John, it might have been altogether as well, perhaps, if we had never met.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, madam, my behaviour has offended you, but—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(to Caelia as she enters.)</STAGE>
<P>Leave the house indeed! Come, come, you shall speak to him.— What is all this disorder for? Pray, brother, has any thing new happened? — That wretch has been before-hand with us—
<STAGE>(Aside to Belmour.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing at all, Mrs. Araminta; I have only made a very reasonable proposal to him, which he is pleased to treat with his and your usual in∣civility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wrong us, madam, with the imputation. —
<STAGE>(After a pause, and some irresolution, he goes up to Caelia.)</STAGE>
—I thought, Miss Beverley, I had al∣ready given up my authority, and that you were perfectly at liberty to follow your own inclinations. I could have wished, indeed, to have still assisted you with my advice; and I flattered myself that my presence would have been no restraint upon your conduct. But I find it is otherwise. My very roof is grown irksome to you, and the inno∣cent pleasure I received in observing your growing virtues, is no longer to be indulged to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, put not so hard a construction upon what I thought a blameless proceeding. Can it be won∣dered at, that I should fly from him, who has twice rejected me with disdain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>With disdain, Caelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who has withdrawn from me even his parental tenderness, and driven me to the hard necessity of avoiding him, lest I should offend him farther.</P>
<P>I know how much my inexperience wants a faithful guide; I know what cruel censures a ma∣licious world will pass upon my conduct; but I must bear them all. For he who might protect me from myself, protect me from the insults of li∣centious tongues, abandons me to fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Caelia!—have I, have I abandoned thee? —Heaven knows my inmost soul how it did rejoice but a few moments ago, when Modely told me that your heart was mine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Modely!—Did Modely tell you so? — Do you hear that, Mr. Belmour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did, my sister, with every circumstance which could increase his own guilt, and her in∣tegrity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was honest, however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought it so, and respected him accordingly. O he breathed comfort to a despairing wretch! but now a thousand thousand doubts crowd in up∣on me. He leaves my house this instant; nay, may be gone already. Caelia too is flying from me,—perhaps to join him, and with her hap∣pier lover, smile at my undoing!—
<STAGE>(Leans on Araminta.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I burst with indignation!—Can I be suspected
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
of such treachery? Can you, Sir, who know my every thought, harbour such a suspicion?—O ma∣dam, this contempt have you brought upon me. A want of deceit was all the little negative praise I had to boast of, and that is now denied me.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Leans on Lady Beverley.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come away, child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam. I have a harder task still to per∣form.
<STAGE>Comes up to Sir John</STAGE>
To offer you my hand again under these circum∣stances, thus despicable as you have made me, may seem an insult. But I mean it not as such.—O Sir, if you ever loved my father, in pity to my orphan state, let me not leave you. Shield me from the world, shield me from the worst of misfortunes, your own unkind suspicions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What fooling is here? Help me, Mr. Belmour. —There, take her hand. — And now let it go if you can.</P>

<STAGE>(grasping her hand.)</STAGE>
<P>O Caelia! may I believe Modely? Is your heart mine?</P>

<P>It is, and ever shall be.</P>

</SP>

<P>I should, think Sir John, a mother's consent — tho' Mrs. Araminta, I see, has been so very good to take that office upon herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, madam; my thoughts were too much engaged. — But may I hope for your concurrence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to say to you; I think you have bewitch'd the girl amongst you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, lady Beverley, this is quite preposterous. —Ha!—He here again!—Protect me, Mr. Belmour.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> MODELY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you need fly no where for protection: you have no insolence to fear from me. I am humbled sufficiently, and the post-chaise is now at the door to banish me for ever.— My sole business here is, to unite that virtuous man with the most worthy of her sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(half aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Thank you for the compliment—Now, Mr. Belmour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may spare yourself that trouble, cousin Mode∣ly; the girl is irrecoverably gone already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>May all the happiness they deserve attend them!
<STAGE>Going, then looks back at Araminta.</STAGE>
I cannot leave her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Modely, is there nobody here besides, whom you ought to take leave of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own my parting from that lady
<STAGE>(to Araminta)</STAGE>
should not be in silence; but a conviction of my guilt stops my tongue from utterance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say I quite believe that; but as our af∣fair may make some noise in the world, for the sake of my own character, I must beg of you to declare before this company, whether any part of my conduct has given even a shadow of excuse for the insult I have received. If it has, be honest, and proclaim it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>None by heaven; the crime was all my own, and I suffer for it justly and severely—with shame I speak it, notwithstanding the appearances to the contrary, my heart was ever yours, and ever will be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied; and will honestly confess, the sole reason of my present appeal was this, that where I had destined my hand, my conduct might ap∣pear unblemished.
<STAGE>Gives her hand to Belmour.</STAGE></P>

<P>What do ye mean? What are ye surprized at? —The insinuating Mr. Modely can never want mistresses any where. Can he, Mr. Belmour? You know him perfectly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Distraction!—Knows me? Yes, he does know me. The villain! though he triumphs in my sufferings, knows what I feel!—You, madam, are just in your severity, from you I have deserved every thing; the anguish, the despair which must attend my future life comes from you like heaven's avenging minister!—But for him —
<STAGE>Sir John interposes.</STAGE>
O for a sword! — But I shall find a time, and a severe one.—Let me go, Sir John—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll carry on the farce no longer.—Rash incon∣siderate madman! The sword which pierces Mr. Belmour's breast, would rob you of the best of friends.—This pretended marriage, for it is no more, was merely contrived by him, to con∣vince me of your sincerity.—Embrace him as your guardian angel, and learn from him to be virtuous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>O madam, let me still plead for him. Surely when a vain man feels himself in the wrong, you cannot desire him to suffer a greater punishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done with fooling.— You told me to∣day, lady Beverley, that he would never return to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I told you at the same time, madam, that if he did—you would take him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>In both you were mistaken. —Mr. Modely, your last behaviour to Caelia and my brother, shews a generosity of temper I did not think you capable
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
of, and for that I thank you. But to be serious on our own affair, whatever appearance your present change may carry with it, your transactions of to-day have been such, that I can never hereafter have that respect for you, which a wife ought to have for her husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to say it, Mr. Modely, her deter∣mination is, I fear, too just. Trust to time how∣ever, at least let us part friends, and not abruptly. We should conceal the failings of each other, and if it must come to that, endeavour to find out spe∣cious reasons for breaking off the match, without injuring either party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To shew how willing I am to conceal every thing, now I have had my little female revenge, as my brother has promised us the fiddles this evening, Mr. Modely, as usual, shall be my part∣ner in the dance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have deserved this ridicule, madam, and am humbled to what you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, brother, as we all seem in a strange dilemma, why may'nt we have one dance in the garden? it will put us in good humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you please, madam.—Call the fiddles hither, —Don't despair Mr. Modely.
<STAGE>Half aside to him.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not dance, positively.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed but you shall, madam; do you think I will be the only disconsolate swain who wants a partner? Besides, you see there are are so few of us,
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
that we must call in the butler and the ladies maids even to help out the figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, lady Beverley, you must lay aside all ani∣mosities. If I have behaved improperly to you to∣day, I most sincerely ask your pardon, and hope the anxieties I have been under will sufficiently plead my excuse; my future conduct shall be irre∣proachable.
<STAGE>Turning to Caelia.</STAGE></P>
<P>Here have I placed my happiness, and here ex∣pect it. O Caelia, if the seriousness of my beha∣viour should hereafter offend you, impute it to my infirmity; it can never proceed from want of affection.</P>
<Q><L>A heart like mine its <HI>own</HI> distress contrives,</L>
<L>And feels <HI>most</HI> sensibly the pain it gives;</L>
<L>Then even its frailties candidly approve,</L>

<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<L>WELL, ladies, am I right, or am I not?</L>
<L>Should not this foolish passion be forgot;</L>
<L>This fluttering something, scarce to be exprest,</L>
<L>Which pleads for coxcombs in each female breast?</L>
<L>How mortified he look'd! — and looks so still.</L>
<STAGE>Turning to Modely.</STAGE>
<L>He really may repent — perhaps he will. —</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Will, Araminta?—Ladies, be so good,</L>
<L>Man's made of frail materials, flesh and blood.</L>
<L>We all offend at some unhappy crisis,</L>
<L>Have whims, caprices, vanities, — and vices.</L>
<L>Your happier sex by nature was design'd,</L>
<L>Her last best work, to perfect humankind.</L>
<L>No spot, no blemish the fair frame deforms,</L>
<L>No avarice taints, no naughty passion warms</L>
<L>Your firmer hearts. No love of change in you</L>
<L>E'er taught desire to stray. —</L>

<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<L>All this is true.</L>
<L><PB REF="95"/>Yet stay; the men, perchance, will call it sneer,</L>
<L>And some few ladies think you not sincere.</L>
<L>For your petition, whether wrong or right,</L>
<L>Whate'er it be, withdraw it for to-night.</L>
<L>Another time, if I should want a spouse,</L>
<L>I may myself report it to the house:</L>
<L>At present, let us strive to mend the age;</L>
<L>Let justice reign, at least upon the stage.</L>
<L>Where the fair dames, who like to live by rule,</L>
<L>May learn two lessons from the <HI>LOVER'S SCHOOL.</HI></L>
<L>While Caelia's choice instructs them how to chuse,</L>
