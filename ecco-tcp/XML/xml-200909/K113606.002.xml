<HEAD>CHAP. I. A Comparison of Animals with the inferior Ranks of
Creation.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given an account of the earth in general, and the advantages
and inconveniencies with which it abounds, we now come to con∣sider it more
minutely. Having described the habitation, we are naturally led to enquire
after the inhabitants. Amidst the infinitely different productions which the
earth offers, and with which it is every where covered, ani∣mals hold the
first rank; as well because of the finer formation of their parts as of
their supe∣rior power. The vegetable, which is fixed to <PB N="2" REF="4"/>
one spot, and obliged to wait for its accidental supplies of nourishment,
may be considered as the prisoner of nature. Unable to correct the
disadvantages of its situation, or to shield itself from the dangers
that surround it, every object that has motion may be its destroyer.</P>
<P>But, animals are endowed with powers, of motion and defence. The
greatest part are capable, by changing place, of commanding Nature; and of
thus obliging her to furnish that nourishment which is most agreeable to
their state. Those few that are fixed to one spot, even in this
seemingly helpless situation, are, nevertheless, protected from
external injury, by an hard shelly covering; which they often can close at
pleasure, and thus defend them∣selves from every assault. And here, I
think, we may draw the line between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Every
animal, by some means or other, finds protection from injury; either from its
force, or courage, its swiftness, or cunning. Some are protected by hiding
in convenient places; and others by taking refuge in an hard resisting
shell. But, vegetables are totally unprotected; they are exposed to every
assailant, and patiently submissive in every at∣tack. In a word, an
animal is an organized being that is in some measure provided for its own 
<PB N="3" REF="5"/> security; a vegetable is destitute of every
pro∣tection.</P>
<P>But though it is very easy, without the help of definitions, to
distinguish a plant from an animal, yet both possess many properties
so much alike, that the two kingdoms, as they are called, seem mixed with
each other. Hence, it frequently puzzles the naturalist to tell ex∣actly
where animal life begins, and vegetative terminates; nor, indeed, is it easy
to resolve, whether some objects offered to view be of the lowest of the
animal, or the highest of the vege∣table races. The sensitive plant, that
moves at the touch, seems to have as much perception as the fresh water
polypus, that is possessed of a still flower share of motion.
Besides, the sen∣sitive plant will not re-produce upon cutting in pieces,
which the polypus is known to do; so that the vegetable production seems to
have the superiority. But, notwithstanding this, the polypus hunts for its
food, as most other animals do. It changes its situation; and, therefore
possesses a power of chusing its food, or retreating from danger.
Still, there∣fore, the animal kingdom is far removed above the vegetable; and
its lowest denizen is pos∣sessed of very great privileges, when
com∣pared with the plants with which it is often surrounded.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>However, both classes have many
resem∣blances, by which they are raised above the un∣organized and inert
masses of nature. Mi∣nerals are mere inactive, insensible bodies,
en∣tirely motionless of themselves, and waiting some external force to
alter their forms, or their properties. But, it is otherwise with animals and
vegetables; these are endued with life and vigour; they have their state of
im∣provement and decay; they are capable of re∣producing their kinds; they grow
from seeds, in some, and from cuttings in others; they seem all
possessed of sensation, in a greater or less degree; they both
have their enmities and affections; and as some animals are, by nature,
impelled to violence, so some plants are found to exterminate all others,
and make a wilder∣ness of the places round them. As the lion makes a desert
of the forest where it resides, thus no other plant will grow under the
shade of the machinel-tree. Thus, also, that plant, in the West-Indies,
called caraguata, clings round whatever tree it happens to approach: there it
quickly gains the ascendant; and, load∣ing the same with a verdure not its
own, keeps away that nourishment designed to feed the trunk; and, at
last, entirely destroys its sup∣porter.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>As all animals are ultimately supported upon
vegetables, so vegetables are greatly pro∣pagated, by being made a part of
animal food. Birds distribute the seeds wherever they fly, and quadrupeds
prune them into greater luxuriance. By these means the quantity of food, in a
state of nature, is kept equal to the number of the consumers; and, lest
some of the weaker ranks of animals should find nothing for their
support, but all the provisions be devoured by the strong, different
vegetables are appropriated to different appetites. If transgressing this
rule, the stronger ranks should invade the rights of the weak, and,
breaking through all regard to appetite, should make an indiscriminate
use of every vegetable, nature then punishes the transgression, and
poison marks the crime as capital.</P>
<P>If again we compare vegetables and animals, with respect to the
places where they are found, we shall find them bearing a still stronger
simili∣tude. The vegetables that grow in a dry and sunny soil, are
strong and vigorous, though not luxuriant; so, also, are the animals of
such a climate. Those, on the contrary, that are the joint product of heat
and moisture, are luxuriant and tender: and the animals assimi∣lating to
the vegetable food, on which they ulti∣mately <PB N="6" REF="8"/> subsist,
are much larger in such places than in others. Thus, in the internal parts of
South-America, and Africa, where the sun usually scorches all above,
while inundations cover all below, the insects, reptiles, and other animals,
grow to a prodigious size: the earth∣worm of America is often a yard in
length, and as thick as a walking cane; the boiguacu, which is the largest of
the serpent kind, is sometimes forty feet in length; the bats, in those
countries, are as big as a rabbit; the toads are bigger than a duck, and their
spiders are as large as a sparrow. On the contrary, in the cold frozen
regions of the north, where ve∣getable nature is stinted of its growth, the
few animals in those climates partake of the dimi∣nution; all the wild
animals, except the bear, are much smaller than in milder countries; and
such of the domestic kinds as are carried thither, quickly degenerate, and
grow less. Their very insects are of the minute kinds, their bees and
spiders being not half so large as those in the temperate zone.</P>
<P>The similitude between vegetables and ani∣mals is no where more
obvious than in those that belong to the ocean, where the nature of one is
admirably adapted to the necessities of the other. This element it is well
known has its vegetables, <PB N="7" REF="9"/> and its insects that feed upon
them in great abundance. Over many tracts of the sea, a weed is seen
floating, which covers the surface, and gives the resemblance of a green
and extensive meadow. On the under side of these unstable plants,
millions of little animals are found, adapted to their situation. For as
their ground, if I may so express it, lies over their heads, their feet are
placed upon their backs; and as land animals have their legs below their
bodies, these have them above. At land also, most animals are furnished
with eyes to see their food; but at sea, almost all the reptile kinds are
without eyes, which might only give them prospects of danger, at a time when
unprovided with the means of escaping it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Amaenitates, vol. v. p. 68.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus, in all places, we perceive an obvious similitude between the
animals and the vege∣tables of every region. In general, however, the most
perfect races have the least similitude to the vegetable productions on
which they are ultimately fed; while, on the contrary, the meaner the animal,
the more local it is found to be, and the more it is influenced by the
va∣rieties of the soil where it resides. Many of the more humble reptile
kinds are not only confined to one country, but also to a plant; nay, even to
<PB N="8" REF="10"/> a leaf. Upon that they subsist; encrease with its
vegetation, and seem to decay as it declines. They are merely the
circumscribed inhabitants of a single vegetable; take them from that and
they instantly die; being entirely assimilated to the plant they feed on,
assuming its colour, and even its medicinal properties. For this reason
there are infinite numbers of the meaner animals that we have never an
opportunity of seeing in this part of the world; they are inca∣pable of
living separate from their kindred ve∣getables, which grow only in a certain
climate.</P>
<P>Such animals as are formed more perfect, lead a life of less
dependance; and, some kinds are found to subsist in many parts of the
world at the same time. But, of all the races of animated nature, man is the
least af∣fected by the soil where he resides, and least influenced by
the variations of vegetable sustenance: equally unaffected by the
luxuriance of the warm climates, or the sterility of the poles, he has
spread his habitations over the whole earth; and finds subsistence as
well amidst the ice of the north as the burning de∣sarts under the line.
All creatures of an in∣ferior nature, as has been said, have peculiar
propensities to peculiar climates; they are cir∣cumscribed to zones, and
confined to territo∣ries <PB N="9" REF="11"/> where their proper food is found
in greatest abundance; but, man may be called the ani∣mal of every climate,
and suffers but very gra∣dual alterations from the nature of any
situation.</P>
<P>As to animals of a meaner rank, whom man compels to attend him in
his migrations, these being obliged to live in a state of constraint, and
upon vegetable food, often different from that of their native soil, they
very soon alter their natures with the nature of their nourishment,
as∣similate to the vegetables upon which they are fed, and thus assume
very different habits as well as appearances. Thus, man, unaffected himself,
alters and directs the nature of other animals at his pleasure; encreases
their strength for his delight, or their patience for his
ne∣cessities.</P>
<P>And this power of altering the appearances of things seems to have
been given him for very wise purposes. The Deity, when he made the earth,
was willing to give his favoured creature many opponents, that might at once
exercise his virtues, and call forth his latent abilities. Hence we find, in
those wide uncultivated wildernesses, where man, in his savage state,
owns inferior strength, and the beasts claim divided dominion, that the
whole forest swarms with noxious animals and vegetables; animals, 
<PB N="10" REF="12"/> as yet undescribed, and vegetables which want a name. In
those recesses Nature seems rather lavish than magnificent, in
bestowing life. The trees are usually of the largest kinds, covered round
with parasite plants, and inter∣woven at the tops with each other. The
boughs, both above and below, are peopled with various generations; some of
which have never been upon the ground, and others that have never stirred
from the branches on which they were produced. In this manner millions of
minute, and loathsome creatures, pursue a round of uninterrupted
existence, and enjoy a life scarce superior to vegetation. At the same
time, the vegetables, in those places, are of the larger kinds, while the
animal race is of the smaller: but, man has altered this dis∣position of
nature; having, in a great measure, levelled the extensive forests,
cultivated the softer and finer vegetables, destroyed the num∣berless
tribes of minute and noxious animals, and taken every method to encrease a
numerous breed of the larger kinds. He thus has ex∣ercised a severe
control; unpeopled nature, to embellish it; and diminished the size of
vege∣table, in order to improve that of the animal kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>To subdue the earth to his own use, was, and
ought to be, the aim of man; which was only to be done by encreasing the
number of plants, and diminishing that of animals: to multiply existence,
alone was that of the Deity. For this reason, we find, in a state of
nature, that animal life is encreased to the greatest quantity
possible: and, we can scarce form a system that could add to its
numbers. First, plants, or trees, are provided, by Nature, of the largest
kinds; and, consequently, the nou∣rishing surface is thus extended. In
the second place, there are animals peculiar to every part of the vegetable,
so that no part of it is lost. But, the greatest possible encrease
of life would still be deficient, were there not other animals that lived
upon animals themselves; and these are, themselves, in turn, food for
some other greater and stronger set of crea∣tures. Were all animals to
live upon vegetables alone, thousands would be extinct that now have
existence, as the quantity of their pro∣vision would shortly fail. But,
as things are wisely constituted, one animal now supports another; and
thus, all take up less room than they would by living on the same food; as,
to make use of a familiar instance, a greater number of people may be
crowded into the <PB N="12" REF="14"/> same space, if each is made to bear
his fellow upon his shoulders.</P>
<P>To diminish the number of animals, and en∣crease that of
vegetables, has been the general scope of human industry; and, if we
compare the utility of the kinds, with respect to man, we shall find, that
of the vast variety in the animal kingdom, but very few are serviceable to
him; and, in the vegetable, but very few are entirely noxious. How small a
part of the insect tribes, for instance, are beneficial to man∣kind, and
what numbers are injurious! In some countries they almost darken the air: a
candle cannot be lighted without their instantly flying upon it, and putting
out the flame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa's Description of
Guayaquil.</BIBL></NOTE>. The closest recesses are no safeguard from
their an∣noyance; and the most beautiful landscapes of nature only serve
to invite their rapacity. As these are injurious, from their multitudes; so
most of the larger kinds are equally dreadful to him, from their courage and
ferocity. In the most uncultivated parts of the forest these maintain an
undisputed empire; and man in∣vades their retreats with terror. These are
terrible; and there are still more that are ut∣terly useless to him, that
serve to take up that room which more beneficial creatures 
<PB N="13" REF="15"/> might possess; and incommode him, rather with their
numbers than their enmities. Thus, in a catalogue of land animals, that amounts
to more than twenty thousand, we can scarcely reckon up an hundred that are
any way useful to him; the rest, being either all his open, or his secret
enemies, immediately attacking him in person, or intruding upon that food he
has appro∣priated to himself. Vegetables, on the contrary, though existing
in greater variety, are but few of them noxious. The most deadly poisons
are often of great use in medicine; and even those plants that only seem
to cumber the ground, serve for food to that race of animals which he has
taken into friendship, or protection. The smaller tribes of vegetables, in
particular, are cultivated, as contributing either to his neces∣sities, or
amusement; so that vegetable life is as much promoted, by human industry,
as animal life is controlled and diminished.</P>
<P>Hence, it was not without a long struggle, and various
combinations, of experience and art, that man acquired his present dominion.
Almost every good that he possesses was the result of the
contest; for, every day, as he was con∣tending, he was growing more wise;
and, pa∣tience and fortitude were the fruits of his in∣dustry.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16"/>From hence, also, we see the necessity
of some animals living upon each other, to fill up the plan of Providence;
and we may, conse∣quently, infer the expediency of man's living upon all.
Both animals and vegetables seem equally fitted to his appetites; and, were
any religious, or moral motives, to restrain him from taking away life, upon
any account, he would only thus give existence to a variety of beings made to
prey upon each other; and, instead of preventing, he would only thus multiply
mu∣tual destruction.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Generation of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we survey animals in their state of maturity, and
performing the functions adapted to their respective natures, method requires
that we should consider them in the more early periods of their
existence. There was a time when the proudest and the noblest animal was
a partaker of the same imbecility with the meanest reptile; and, while yet
a candidate for existence, was equally helpless and contemp∣tible. In their
incipient state all are upon a footing; the insect and the philosopher
being equally insensible, clogged with matter, and unconscious of
existence. Where then are we to begin with the history of those beings,
that make such a distinguished figure in the crea∣tion? Or, where lie
those peculiar characters in the parts that go to make up animated nature;
that mark one animal as destined to creep in the dust, and another to
glitter on the throne?</P>
<P>This has been a subject that has employed the curiosity of all
ages, and the philosophers of every age have attempted the solution. In
tracing up Nature to her most hidden recesses, <PB N="16" REF="18"/> she
becomes too minute, or obscure, for our inspection; so that we find it
impossible to mark her first differences, to discover the point where
animal life begins, or the cause that conduces to set it in motion. We know
little more than that the greatest number of animals require the concurrence
of a male and female to reproduce their kind; and that these, distinctly
and invariably, are found to beget creatures of their own species.
Curiosity has, therefore, been active, in trying to discover the imme∣diate
result of this union, how far either sex contributes to the bestowing
animal life, and whether it be to the male or female that we are most
indebted for the privilege of our ex∣istence.</P>
<P>Hippocrates has supposed that fecundity pro∣ceeded from the
mixture of the seminal liquor of both sexes, each of which equally
contri∣bute to the formation of the incipient animal. Aristotle, on the other
hand, would have the seminal liquor in the male alone to contribute to this
purpose, while the female supplied the proper nourishment for its
support. Such were the opinions of these fathers of philosophy; and
these continued to be adopted by the na∣turalists, and school-men, of
succeeding ages, with blind veneration. At length, Steno and 
<PB N="17" REF="19"/> Harvey, taking anatomy for their guide, gave mankind a
nearer view of nature, just advanc∣ing into animation. These perceived in
all such animals as produced their young alive, two glandular bodies, near
the womb, re∣sembling that ovary, or cluster of small eggs, which is
found in fowls; and, from the analogy between both, they gave these also
the name of ovaria. These, as they resembled eggs, they naturally concluded
had the same offices; and, therefore, they were induced to think that all
animals, of what kind soever, were produced from eggs. At first, however,
there was some altercations raised against this system; for, as
these ovaria were separate from the womb, it was objected that they could
not be any way instrumental in replenishing that organ, with which they did
not communicate. But, upon more minute inspection, Fallopius, the
anato∣mist, perceived two tubular vessels depending from the womb, which,
like the horns of a snail, had a power of erecting themselves, of embracing
the ovaria, and of receiving the eggs, in order to be fecundated by the
seminal liquor. This discovery seemed, for a long time after, to fix the
opinions of philosophers. The doctrine of Hippocrates was re-established,
and the chief business of generation was ascribed <PB N="18" REF="20"/> to
the female. This was, for a long time, the established opinion of the
schools; but Lowen∣hoeck, once more, shook the whole system, and
produced a new schism among the lovers of speculation. Upon examining the
seminal li∣quor of a great variety of male animals, with microscopes, which
helped his sight more than that of any of his successors, he perceived
therein infinite numbers of little living crea∣tures, like tadpoles, very
brisk, and floating in the fluid, with a seeming voluntary motion. Each of
these, therefore, was thought to be the rudiments of an animal, similar to
that from which it was produced; and this only re∣quired a reception from the
female, together with proper nourishment, to complete its growth. The
business of generation was now, therefore, given back to the male a
second time, by many; while others suspended their assent, and
chose rather to confess ignorance than to embrace error<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bonet's Considerations sur Corps
Organises.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this manner has the dispute continued for several ages,
some accidental discovery serving, at intervals, to renew the debate, and
revive cu∣riosity. It was a subject where speculation could find much
room to display itself; and, Mr. Buffon, who loved to speculate, would
not <PB N="19" REF="21"/> omit such an opportunity of giving scope to his
propensity. According to this most pleasing of all naturalists, the
microscope discovers that the seminal liquor, not only of males, but of
females also, abounds in these moving little animals, which have been
mentioned above, and that they appear equally brisk in either fluid. These
he takes not to be real animals, but organical particles, which, being
simple, cannot be said to be organized themselves, but which go to the
composition of all organized bodies what∣soever. In the same manner as a
tooth, in the wheel of a watch, cannot be called either the wheel, or the
watch, and yet contributes to the sum of the machine. These organical
particles are, according to him, diffused throughout all nature, and to be
found not only in the seminal liquor, but in most other fluids in the parts
of vegetables, and all parts of animated nature. As they happen, therefore, to
be differently applied, they serve to constitute a part of the animal, or
the vegetable, whose growth they serve to encrease, while the
superfluity is thrown off in the seminal liquor of both sexes, for the
re-production of other animals or vegetables of the same species. These
particles assume different figures, according to the receptacle into which
they enter; falling into the womb <PB N="20" REF="22"/> they unite into a
foetus; beneath the bark of a tree they pullulate into branches; and, in
short, the same particles that first formed the animal in the womb,
contribute to encrease its growth when brought forth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this system it has been objected, that it is impossible
to conceive organical sub∣stances without being organized; and that, if
divested of organization themselves, they could never make an organized
body, as an infinity of circles could never make a triangle. It has been
objected, that it is more difficult to con∣ceive the transformation of these
organical par∣ticles than even that of the animal, whose growth we are
enquiring after; and this system, therefore, attempts to explain one
obscure thing by another still more obscure.</P>
<P>But an objection, still stronger than these, has been
advanced, by an ingenious country∣man of our own; who asserts, that these
little animals, which thus appear swimming, and sporting, in almost every
fluid we examine with a microscope, are not real living particles, but some
of the more opake parts of the fluid, that are thus encreased in size, and
seem to have a much greater motion than they have in reality. For the motion
being magnified with the object, <PB N="21" REF="23"/> the smallest degree
of it will seem very consider∣able; and a being almost at rest may, by
these means, be apparently put into violent action. Thus, for instance, if
we look upon the sails of a windmill moving, at a distance, they appear to
go very slow; but, if we approach them, and thus magnify their bulk to our
eye, they go round with great rapidity. A microscope, in the same manner,
serves to bring our eye close to the object, and thus to enlarge it; and
not only encrease the magnitude of its parts, but of its motion. Hence,
therefore, it would follow, that these organical par∣ticles that are said
to constitute the bulk of living nature, are but mere optical illusions;
and the system founded on them must, like them, be illusive.</P>
<P>These, and many other objections, have been made to this
system; which, instead of enlight∣ening the mind, serve only to shew,
that too close a pursuit of Nature chiefly leads to un∣certainty. Happily,
however, for mankind, the most intricate enquiries are generally the most
useless. Instead, therefore, of balancing accounts between the sexes,
and attempting to ascertain to which the business of generation most
properly belongs, it will be more in∣structive, as well as amusing, to
begin with <PB N="22" REF="24"/> animal nature, from its earliest retirements,
and evanescent outlines, and pursue the incipient creature through all its
changes in the womb till it arrives into open day.</P>
<P>The usual distinction of animals, with re∣spect to their
manner of generation, has been into the oviparous and viviparous kinds; or, in
other words, into those that bring forth an egg, which is afterwards hatched
into life, and those that bring forth their young alive and perfect. In one
of these two ways all ani∣mals were supposed to have been produced, and
all other kinds of generation were supposed imaginary or erroneous. But
later discoveries have taught us to be more cautious in making general
conclusions, and have even induced many to doubt whether animal life may not
be produced merely from putrefaction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bonet.
Consid. p. 100.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Indeed, the infinite number of creatures that putrid substances
seem to give birth to, and the variety of little insects seen floating in
liquors, by the microscope, appear to favour this opi∣nion. But, however this
may be, the former method of classing animals can now by no means be
admitted, as we find many animals that are produced neither from the womb, nor
from the shell, but merely from cuttings; so <PB N="23" REF="25"/> that to
multiply life in some creatures, it is sufficient only to multiply the
dissection. This being the simplest method of generation, and that in
which life seems to require the smallest preparation for its existence,
I will begin with it, and so proceed to the two other kinds, from the
meanest to the most elaborate.</P>
<P>The earth-worm, the millipedes, the sea-worm, and many marine
insects, may be multiplied by being cut in pieces; but the polypus is noted
for its amazing fertility; and from hence it will be proper to take the
description. The structure of the polypus may be compared to the finger of
a glove, open at one end, and closed at the other. The closed end
represents the tail of the polypus, with which it serves to fix itself to
any substance it happens to be upon; the open end may be compared to the
mouth; and, if we conceive six or eight small strings issuing from
this end, we shall have a proper idea of its arms, which it can erect,
lengthen, and contract, at pleasure, like the horns of a snail. This
creature is very voracious, and makes use of its arms as a fisherman does
of his net, to catch, and entangle such little animals as happen to come
within its reach. It lengthens these arms several inches, keeps them
separated from each other, and thus oc∣cupies <PB N="24" REF="26"/> a large
space in the water, in which it resides. These arms, when extended, are
as fine as threads of silk, and have a most exqui∣site degree of feeling.
If a small worm happens to get within the sphere of their activity, it is
quickly entangled by one of these arms, and, soon after, the other arms
come to its aid: these altogether shortening, the worm is drawn into the
animal's mouth, and quickly devoured, colouring the body as it is swallowed.
Thus much is necessary to be observed of this ani∣mal's method of living,
to shew that it is not of the vegetable tribe, but a real animal, perform∣ing
the functions which other animals are found to perform, and endued with powers
that many of them are destistute of. But what is most extraordinary
remains yet to be told; for, if examined with a microscope, there are seen
se∣veral little specks, like buds, that seem to pul∣lulate from different
parts of its body; and these, soon after appear to be young polypi
themselves, and like the large polypus, begin to cast their little arms
about for prey, in the same manner. Whatever they happen to ensnare is
de∣voured, and gives a colour not only to their own bodies, but to that of the
parent; so that the same food is digested, and serves for the
nou∣rishment of both. The food of the little one <PB N="25" REF="27"/>
passes into the large polypus, and colours its body; and this, in its turn,
digests, and swal∣lows its food to pass into theirs. In this man∣ner
every polypus has a new colony sprouting from its body; and these new ones,
even while attached to the parent animal, become parents themselves, having a
smaller colony also bud∣ding from them. All, at the same time, busily
employed in seeking for their prey, and the food of any one of them serving
for the nou∣rishment, and circulating through the bodies of all the rest.
This society, however, is every hour dissolving; those newly produced
are seen at intervals to leave the body of the large poly∣pus, and become,
shortly after, the head of a beginning colony themselves.</P>
<P>In this manner the polypus multiplies natu∣rally; but, one may take
a much readier and shorter way to encrease them, and this only by cutting
them in pieces. Though cut into thou∣sands of parts, each part still
retains its viva∣cious quality, each shortly becomes a distinct and a
complete polypus; whether cut lengthways, or crossways, it is all the same;
this extraordinary creature seems a gainer by our endeavours, and multiplies
by apparent destruction. The ex∣periment has been tried, times without
number, and still attended with the same success. Here, 
<PB N="26" REF="28"/> therefore, naturalists who have been blamed for the
cruelty of their experiments upon living animals, may now boast of their
encreasing animal life, instead of destroying it. The pro∣duction of the
polypus is a kind of philoso∣phical generation. The famous Sir Thomas Brown
hoped one day to be able to produce children by the same method as trees are
pro∣duced; the polypus is multiplied in this man∣ner; and every philosopher
may thus, if he pleases, boast of a very numerous, though, I should
suppose, a very useless progeny.</P>
<P>This method of generation, from cuttings, may be considered as the
most simple kind, and is a strong instance of the little pains Nature
takes in the formation of her lower, and humbler productions. As the removal of
these from inanimate into animal existence is but small, there are but
few preparations made for their journey. No organs of generation seem
provided, no womb to receive, no shell to protect them in in their state of
transition. The little reptile is quickly fitted for all the offices of its
humble sphere, and, in a very short time, arrives at the height of its
contemptible perfection.</P>
<P>The next generation is of those animals that we see produced
from the egg. In this man∣ner all birds, most fishes, and many of the
in∣sect <PB N="27" REF="29"/> tribes, are brought forth. An egg may be
considered as a womb, detached from the body of the parent animal, in which
the embryo is but just beginning to be formed. It may be regarded as a kind
of incomplete delivery, in which the animal is disburthened of its young
before its perfect formation. Fishes, and in∣sects, indeed, most
usually commit the care of their eggs to hazard; but birds, which are more
perfectly formed, are found to hatch them into maturity, by the warmth of their
bodies. How∣ever, any other heat, of the same temperature, would answer the
end as well; for either the warmth of the sun, or of a stove, is equally
efficacious in bringing the animal in the egg to perfection. In this respect,
therefore, we may consider generation from the egg as inferior to that in
which the animal is brought forth alive. Nature has taken care of the
viviparous ani∣mal in every stage of its existence. That force which
separates it from the parent, separates it from life; and the embryo is
shielded with un∣ceasing protection till it arrives at exclusion. But it
is different with the little animal in the egg; often totally neglected by the
parent, and always separable from it, every accident may retard its growth,
or even destroy its exist∣ence. Besides, art, or accident, also, may
bring <PB N="28" REF="30"/> this animal to a state of perfection; so that it
can never be considered as a complete work of Nature, in which so much is
left for accident to finish, or destroy.</P>
<P>But, however inferior this kind of generation may be, the
observation of it will afford great in∣sight into that of nobler animals,
as we can here watch the progress of the growing embryo, in every period of
its existence, and catch it in those very moments when it first seems
stealing into motion. Malpighi and Haller have been particularly
industrious on this subject; and, with a patience almost equalling that
of the sit∣ting hen, have attended incubation in all its stages. From them,
therefore, we have an amazing history of the chicken in the egg, and of its
advances into complete formation.</P>
<P>It would be methodically tedious to describe those parts of the
egg, which are well known, and obvious; such as its shell, its white, and
its yolk; but the disposition of these is not so apparent. Immediately
under the shell lies that common membrane, or skin, which lines it on the
inside, adhereing closely to it every where, except at the broad end, where
a little cavity is left, that is filled with air, which encreases as the
animal within grows larger. Under this mem∣brane are contained two whites,
though seeming to us to be only one, each wrapped up in a <PB N="29" REF="31"/> membrane of its own, one white within the other. In the midst of
all is the yolk, wrapt round, likewise, in its own membrane. At each end of
this are two ligaments, called chalazae, which are, as it were, the poles of
this microcosm, being white dense substances, made from the membranes,
and serving to keep the white and the yolk in their places. It was the
opinion of Mr. Derham that they served also for ano∣ther purpose: for a
line being drawn from one ligament to the other, would not pass directly
through the middle of the yolk, but rather to∣wards one side, and would
divide the yolk into two unequal parts, by which means these liga∣ments
served to keep the smallest side of the yolk always uppermost; and in
this part he supposed the cicatricula, or first speck of life, to
reside; which, by being upermost, and con∣sequently next the hen, would
be thus in the warmest situation. But this is rather fan∣ciful than true,
the incipient animal being found in all situations, and not particularly
in∣fluenced by any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Haller.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
cicatricula, which is the part where the animal first begins to shew
signs of life, is not unlike a vetch, or a lentil, lying on one side of the
yolk, and within its mem∣brane. All these contribute to the little ani∣mal's
convenience, or support; the outer mem∣branes, <PB N="30" REF="32"/> and
ligaments, preserve the fluids in their proper places; the white serves as
nourish∣ment; and the yolk, with its membranes, after a time, becomes a part
of the animal's body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Haller.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
is the description of an hen's egg, and answers to that of all others, how
large or how small soever.</P>
<P>Previous to putting the eggs to the hen, our philosophers first
examined the cicatricula, or little spot, already mentioned; and which may be
considered as the most important part of the egg. This was found, in
those that were im∣pregnated by the cock, to be large; but, in those laid
without the cock, very small. It was found, by the microscope, to be a kind
of bag, containing a transparent liquor, in the midst of which the embryo
was seen to reside. The embryo resembled a composition of little
threads, which the warmth of future incubation tended to enlarge, by varying,
and liquifying the other fluids contained within the shell, and thus
pressing them either into the pores or tubes of their substance.</P>
<P>Upon placing the eggs in a proper warmth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Malpighi.</BIBL></NOTE>, either under the sun, or in a
stove, after six hours the vital speck begins to dilate, like the pupil
of the eye. The head of the chicken is <PB N="31" REF="33"/> distinctly
seen, with the back-bone, something re∣sembling a tadpole, floating in
its ambient fluid, but as yet seeming to assume none of the func∣tions of
animal life. In about six hours more the little animal is seen more
distinctly; the head becomes more plainly visible, and the ver∣tebrae of
the back more easily perceivable. All these signs of preparation for life
are encreased in six hours more; and, at the end of twenty-four hours, the
ribs begin to take their places, the neck begins to lengthen, and the head to
turn to one side.</P>
<P>At this time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Harvey.</BIBL></NOTE>,
also, the fluids in the egg seem to have changed place; the yolk, which was
before in the center of the shell, approaches nearer to the broad end. The
watery part of the white is, in some measure, evaporated through the
shell, and the grosser part sinks to the small end. The little animal
appears to turn towards the part of the broad end, in which a cavity has been
described, and with its yolk seems to adhere to the membrane there. At the
end of forty hours the great work of life seems fairly begun, and the animal
plainly appears to move; the back-bone, which is of a whitish colour,
thickens; the head is turned still more on one side; the first rudiments
of the <PB N="32" REF="34"/> eyes begin to appear; the heart beats, and the
blood begins already to circulate. The parts, however, as yet are fluid; but,
by degrees, become more and more tenacious, and harden into a kind of jelly. At
the end of two days, the liquor, in which the chicken swims, seems to
encrease; the head appears with two little bladders in the place of eyes, the
heart beats in the manner of every embryo where the blood does not circulate
through the lungs. In about fourteen hours after this, the chicken is grown
more strong; its head, however, is still bent downwards; the veins and the
arteries begin to branch, in order to form the brain; and the spinal marrow
is seen stretching along the back bone. In three days, the whole body of
the chicken appears bent; the head, with its two eye-balls, with their
different humours, now distinctly ap∣pear; and five other vesicles are
seen, which soon unite to form the rudiments of the brain. The out-lines
also of the thighs, and wings, begin to be seen, and the body begins to
gather flesh. At the end of the fourth day, the vesicles that go to form
the brain, approach each other; the wings and thighs appear more solid; the
whole body is covered with a jelly like flesh; the heart, that was hitherto
exposed, is now co∣vered up within the body, by a very thin 
<PB N="33" REF="35"/> transparent membrane; and, at the same time, the
umbilical vessels, that unite the animal to the yolk, now appear to come
forth from the ab∣domen. After the fifth and sixth days, the vessels of
the brain begin to be covered over; the wings and thighs lengthen; the belly is
closed up, and tumid; the liver is seen within it, very distinctly, not
yet grown red, but of a very dusky white; both the ventricles of the heart
are discerned, as if they were two separate hearts, beating distinctly;
the whole body of the animal is covered over; and the traces of the incipient
feathers are already to be seen. The seventh day, the head appears very
large; the brain is covered entirely over; the bill begins to appear betwixt
the eyes; and the wings, the thighs, and the legs, have acquired their perfect
figure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Haller.</BIBL></NOTE>. Hitherto, however,
the animal appears as if it had two bodies; the yolk is joined to it by the
umbilical vessels that come from the belly; and is furnished with its
vessels, through which the blood circulates, as through the rest of the
body of the chicken, making a bulk greater than that of the animal itself.
But towards the end of incubation, the umbilical vessels shorten the
yolk, and with it the intes∣tines are thrust up into the body of the
chicken, <PB N="34" REF="36"/> by the action of the muscles of the belly; and
the two bodies are thus formed into one. During this state, all the organs
are found to perform their secretions; the bile is found to be separated,
as in grown animals; but it is fluid, transparent, and without bitterness:
and the chicken then also appears to have lungs. On the tenth, the muscles
of the wings appear, and the feathers begin to push out. On the eleventh, the
heart, which hitherto had appeared divided, begins to unite; the arteries which
belong to it, join into it, like the fingers into the palm of the hand. All
these appearances only come more into view, because the fluids the
vessels had hitherto secreted, were more transparent; but as the
co∣lour of the fluids deepen, their operations and circulations are more
distinctly seen. As the animal thus, by the eleventh day completely formed,
begins to gather strength, it becomes more uneasy in its situation, and
exerts its ani∣mal powers with encreasing force. For some time before it is
able to break the shell in which it is imprisoned, it is heard to chirrup,
receiving a sufficient quantity of air for this purpose, from that cavity
which lies between the membrane and the shell, and which must contain air
to resist the external pressure. At length, upon the twentieth day, in
some birds sooner, and later <PB N="35" REF="37"/> in others, the enclosed
animal breaks the shell within which it has been confined, with its beak;
and, by repeated efforts, at last procures its enlargement.</P>
<P>From this little history we perceive, that those parts which are
most conducive to life, are the first that are begun: the head, and the
back-bone, which no doubt enclose the brain, and the spinal marrow, though
both are too limpid to be discerned, are the first that are seen to
exist; the beating of the heart is perceived soon after: the less noble
parts seem to spring from these; the wings, the thighs, the feet, and,
lastly, the bill. Whatever, therefore, the ani∣mal has double, or whatever it
can live without the use of, these are latest in production: Na∣ture
first sedulously applying to the formation of the nobler organs, without
which life would be of short continuance, and would be begun in vain.</P>
<P>The resemblance between the beginning ani∣mal in the egg, and the
embryo in the womb, is very striking; and this similitude it is that has
induced many to assert, that all animals are produced from eggs, in the
same manner. They consider an egg excluded from the body by some, and
separated into the womb by others, to be actions merely of one kind; with
this only <PB N="36" REF="38"/> difference, that the nourishment of the one is
kept within the body of the parent, and en∣creases as the embryo happens to
want the sup∣ply; the nourishment of the other is prepared all at once, and
sent out with the beginning ani∣mal, as entirely sufficient for its future
support. But leaving this to the discussion of anatomists, let us
proceed rather with facts than disserta∣tions; and as we have seen the
progress of an oviparous animal, or one produced from the shell, let us
likewise trace that of a viviparous animal, which is brought forth alive. In
this investigation, Graaf has, with a degree of pa∣tience, characteristic
of his nation, attended the progress and encrease of various animals in the
womb, and minutely marked the changes they undergo. Having dissected a
rabbit, half an hour after impregnation, he perceived the horns of the womb,
that go to embrace and commu∣nicate with the ovary, to be more red than
be∣fore; but no other change in the rest of the parts. Having dissected
another, six hours after, he perceived the follicules, or the mem∣brane
covering the eggs contained in the ova∣ry, to become reddish. In a rabbit
dissected after twenty-four hours, he perceived, in one of the ovaries,
three follicules, and, in the other, five, that were changed; being become,
from transparent, dark and reddish. In one <PB N="37" REF="39"/>
dissected after three days, he perceived the horns of the womb very
strictly to embrace the ovaries; and he observed three of the fol∣licules
in one of them, much longer and har∣der than before: pursuing his
inquisition, he also found two of the eggs actually separated into the
horns of the womb, and each about the size of a grain of mustard-seed;
these little eggs were each of them enclosed in a double mem∣brane, the
inner parts being filled with a very limpid liquor. After four days, he found,
in one of the ovaries, four, and in the other, five follicules, emptied of
their eggs; and in the horns correspondent to these, he found an equal
number of eggs thus separated: these eggs were now grown larger than
before, and somewhat of the size of sparrow-shot. In five days, the
eggs were grown to the size of duck-shot, and could be blown from the part
of the womb where they were, by the breath. In seven days, these eggs were
found of the size of a pistol-bullet, each covered with its double
membrane, and these much more distinct than before. In nine days, having
examined the liquor contained in one of these eggs, he found it, from a
limpid colour, less fluid, to have got a light cloud floating upon it. In ten
days, this cloud began to thicken, and to form an oblong body, of the figure of
a <PB N="38" REF="40"/> little worm: and, in twelve days, the figure of the
embryo was distinctly to be perceived, and even its parts came into view. In
the region of the breast he perceived two bloody specks; and two more, that
appeared whitish. Fourteen days after impregnation, the head of the embryo
was become large and transparent, the eyes prominent, the mouth open, and the
rudiments of the ears beginning to appear; the back-bone, of a whitish
colour, was bent towards the breast; the two bloody specks being now
considerably encreased, appeared to be nothing less than the outlines of
the two ventricles of the heart; and the two whitish specks on each side,
now appear∣ed to be the rudiments of the lungs; towards the region of the
belly, the liver began to be seen, of a reddish colour; and a little
intricate mass, like ravelled thread, discerned, which soon ap∣peared to
be the stomach and the intestines: the legs soon after began to be
seen, and to assume their natural positions: and from that time forth,
all the parts being formed, every day only served to develope them still
more, until the thirty-first day, when the rabbit brought forth her young,
completely fitted for the purposes of their humble happiness.</P>
<P>Having thus seen the stages of generation in the meaner animals,
let us take a view of its <PB N="39" REF="41"/> progress in man; and trace the
feeble begin∣nings of our own existence. An account of the lowliness of our
own origin, if it cannot amuse, will at least serve to humble us; and it
may take from our pride, though it fails to gra∣tify our curiosity. We cannot
here trace the variations of the beginning animal, as in the former
instances; for the opportunities of in∣spection are but few and accidental:
for this reason, we must be content often to fill up the blanks of our
history with conjecture. And first, we are entirely ignorant of the state
of the infant in the womb, immediately after con∣ception; but we have good
reason to believe, that it proceeds, as in most other animals, from the
egg<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This history of the child in the womb is
translated from Mr. Buffon, with some alterations.</NOTE>. Anatomists
inform us, that four days after conception, there is found in the womb an oval
substance, about the size of a small pea, but longer one way than the
other; this little body is formed by an extremely fine membrane, en∣closing a
liquor a good deal resembling the white of an egg: in this may, even then, be
per∣ceived, several small fibres, united together, which form the first
rudiments of the embryo. Beside these, are seen another set of fibres,
which soon after become the placenta, or that <PB N="40" REF="42"/> body by
which the animal is supplied with nou∣rishment.</P>
<P>Seven days after conception, we can readily distinguish, by the
eye, the first lineaments of the child in the womb. However, they are as yet
without form; shewing, at the end of seven days, pretty much such an
appearance as that of the chicken, after four and twenty hours being a small
jelly-like mass, yet exhibiting the rudi∣ments of the head; the trunk is
barely visible; there likewise is to be discerned a small
assem∣blage of fibres issuing from the body of the in∣fant, which
afterwards become the blood-vessels that convey nourishment from the
placenta to the child, while enclosed in the womb.</P>
<P>Fifteen days after conception, the head be∣comes distinctly
visible, and even the most pro∣minent features of the visage begin to
appear. The nose is a little elevated; there are two black specks in the
place of eyes; and two little holes, where the ears are afterwards seen. The
body of the embryo also is grown larger; and both above and below, are seen
two little protuberances, which mark the places from whence the arms and thighs
are to proceed. The length of the whole body, at this time, is less than half
an inch.</P>
<P>At the end of three weeks, the body has re∣ceived 
<PB N="41" REF="43"/> very little encrease; but the legs and feet, with the
hands and arms, are become ap∣parent. The growth of the arms is more speedy
than that of the legs; and the fingers are sooner separated than the toes.
About this time, the internal parts are found, upon dissection, to be∣come
distinguishable. The places of the bones are marked by small thread-like
substances, that are yet more fluid even than a jelly. Among them, the ribs
are distinguishable, like threads also, disposed on each side of
the spine; and even the fingers and toes scarce exceed hairs in
thick∣ness.</P>
<P>In a month, the embryo is an inch long; the body is bent forward, a
situation which it al∣most always assumes in the womb, either
be∣cause a posture of this kind is the most easy, or because it takes
up the least room. The hu∣man figure is now no longer doubtful: every part of
the face is distinguishable; the body is sketched out; the bowels are to
be distinguished as threads; the bones are still quite soft, but in
some places beginning to assume a greater rigidity; the blood vessels
that go to the placen∣ta, which, as was said, contributes to the child's
nourishment, are plainly seen issuing from the navel (being therefore
called the umbilical vessels) and going to spread themselves upon 
<PB N="42" REF="44"/> the placenta. According to Hippocrates, the male embryo
developes sooner than the female: he adds, that, at the end of thirty days,
the parts of the body of the male are distinguishable; while those of the
female are not equally so till ten days after.</P>
<P>In six weeks, the embryo is grown two inches long; the human
figure begins to grow every day more perfect; the head being still much
larger, in proportion to the rest of the body; and the motion of the heart is
perceived almost by the eye. It has been seen to beat in an em∣bryo of
fifty days old, a long time after it had been taken out of the womb.</P>
<P>In two months, the embryo is more than two inches in length. The
ossification is perceivable in the arms and thighs, and in the point of the
chin, the under jaw being greatly advanced be∣fore the upper. These parts,
however, may as yet be considered as bony points, rather than as bones. The
umbilical vessels, which before went side by side, are now begun to be
twisted, like a rope, one over the other, and go to join with the placenta,
which as yet is but small.</P>
<P>In three months, the embryo is above three inches long, and weighs
about three ounces. Hippocrates observes, that not till then the mother
perceives the child's motion; and he <PB N="43" REF="45"/> adds, that in female
children, the motion is not observable till the end of four months. How∣ever,
this is no general rule, as there are women who assert, that they perceived
themselves to be quick with child, as their expression is, at the end of
two months; so that this quickness seems rather to arise from the
proportion between the child's strength, and the mother's sensibility,
than from any determinate period of time. At all times, however, the child is
equally alive; and, consequently, those juries of matrons that are to
determine upon the pregnancy of cri∣minals, should not enquire whether the
woman be quick, but whether she be with child; if the latter be perceivable,
the former follows of course.</P>
<P>Four months and an half after conception, the embryo is from six
to seven inches long. All the parts are so augmented, that even their
proportions are now distinguishable. The very nails begin to appear upon
the fingers and toes; and the stomach and intestines already begin to
perform their functions of receiving and digest∣ing. In the stomach is
found a liquor similar to that in which the embryo floats; in one part of the
intestines, a milky substance; and, in the other, an excrementitious.
There is found also, a small quantity of bile in the gall-bladder; and 
<PB N="44" REF="46"/> some urine in its own proper receptacle. By this time
also, the posture of the embryo seems to be determined. The head is bent
forward, so that the chin seems to rest upon its breast; the knees are
raised up towards the head, and the legs bent backward, somewhat
resembling the posture of those who sit on their haunches. Sometimes
the knees are raised so high as to touch the cheeks, and the feet are
crost over each other; the arms are laid upon the breast, while one of the
hands, and often both, touch the visage; sometimes the hands are shut,
and sometimes also, the arms are found hanging down by the body. These
are the most usual postures which the embryo assumes; but these it
is frequently known to change; and it is ow∣ing to these alterations that the
mother so fre∣quently feels those twitches, which are usually attended
with pain.</P>
<P>The embryo, thus situated, is furnished by Nature with all
things proper for its support; and, as it encreases in size, its
nourishment also is found to encrease with it. As soon as it first
begins to grow in the womb, that receptacle, from being very small, grows
larger; and, what is more surprizing, thicker every day. The sides of a
bladder, as we know, the more they are distended the more they become thin.
But here, the larger the womb grows the more <PB N="45" REF="47"/> it appears to
thicken. Within this the embryo is still farther involved, in two membranes,
called the chorion, and amnios; and floats in a thin transparent fluid, upon
which it seems, in some measure, to subsist. However, the great
storehouse, from whence its chief nourishment is supplied, is called
the placenta; a red sub∣stance somewhat resembling a sponge, that
ad∣heres to the inside of the womb, and commu∣nicates, by the umbilical
vessels, with the em∣bryo. These umbilical vessels, which consist
of a vein and two arteries, issue from the navel of the child, and are
branched out upon the placenta; where they, in fact, seem to form its
substance; and, if I may so express it, to suck up their
nourishment from the womb, and the fluids contained therein. The blood thus
received from the womb, by the placenta, and communicated by the umbilical vein
to the body of the embryo, is conveyed to the heart; where, without ever
passing into the lungs, as in the born infant, it takes a shorter
course; for, entering the right auricle of the heart, in∣stead of
passing up into the pulmonary artery, it seems to break this partition,
and goes di∣rectly through the body of the heart, by an opening called the
foramen ovale, and from thence to the aorta, or great artery; by which 
<PB N="46" REF="48"/> it is driven into all parts of the body. Thus we see the
placenta, in some measure, supply∣ing the place of lungs; for as the
little animal can receive no air by inspiration, the lungs are therefore
useless. But we see the placenta con∣verting the fluid of the womb into
blood, and sending it, by the umbilical vein, to the heart; from whence it is
dispatched by a quicker and shorter circulation through the whole
frame.</P>
<P>In this manner the embryo reposes in the womb; supplied with
that nourishment which is fitted to its necessities, and furnished with
those organs that are adapted to its situation. As its sensations are
but few, its wants are in the same proportion; and it is probable that a
sleep, with scarce any intervals, marks the earliest period of animal
life. As the little crea∣ture, however, gathers strength and size, it
seems to become more wakeful and uneasy; even in the womb it begins to feel
the want of something that it does not possess; a sensation that
seems coeval with man's nature, and never leaves him till he dies. The embryo
even then begins to struggle for a state more marked by pleasure and
pain, and, from about the sixth month, begins to give the mother warning of
the greater pain she is yet to endure. The continuation of pregnancy, in
woman, is usually <PB N="47" REF="49"/> nine months; but there have been many
in∣stances when the child has lived that was born at seven; and some
also, are found to continue pregnant a month above the usual time. When the
appointed time approaches, the infant, that has for some months been giving
painful proofs of its existence, now begins to encrease its ef∣forts for
liberty. The head is applied down∣ward, to the apperture of the womb, and by
reiterated efforts it endeavours to extend the same: these endeavours
produce the pain which all women, in labour, feel in some degree; those of
strong constitutions the least, those most weakly the most
severely; since we learn, that the women of Africa always deliver
them∣selves, and are well a few hours after; while those of Europe require
assistance, and recover more slowly. Thus the infant, still
continuing to push with its head forward, by the repetition of its
endeavours, at last succeeds, and issues into life. The blood, which
had hitherto passed through the heart, now takes a wider circuit; and the
foramen ovale closes; the lungs, that had till this time been inactive, now
first begin their functions; the air rushes in to distend them; and this
produces the first sensation of pain, which the infant expresses by a
shriek; <PB N="48" REF="50"/> so that the beginning of our lives, as well as
the end, is marked with anguish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bonet
Contemplat. de la Nature, vol. i, p. 212.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From comparing these accounts, we per∣ceive that the most
laboured generation is the most perfect; and that the animal which, in
proportion to its bulk, takes the longest time for production, is always the
most complete when finished. Of all others, man seems the slowest in
coming into life, as he is the slowest in coming to perfection; other
animals, of the same bulk, seldom remain in the womb above six months,
while he continues nine; and even after his birth appears more than any other
to have his state of imbecility prolonged.</P>
<P>We may observe also, that that generation is the most complete
in which the fewest animals are produced: Nature, by attending to the
pro∣duction of one at a time, seems to exert all her efforts in bringing it
to perfection; but, where this attention is divided, the animals so pro∣duced
come into the world with partial ad∣vantages. In this manner twins are never,
at least while infants, so large, or so strong, as those that come
singly into the world; each having, in some measure, robbed the other of
its right; as that support, which Nature meant for one, has been prodigally
divided.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51"/>In this manner, as those animals are the
best that are produced singly, so we find that the noblest animals are
ever the least fruitful. These are seen usually to bring forth but one
at a time, and to place all their attention upon that alone. On the other hand,
all the oviparous kinds produce in amazing plenty; and even the lower tribes of
viviparous animals encrease in a seeming proportion to their minuteness
and imperfection. Nature seems lavish of life in the lower orders of the
creation; and, as if she meant them entirely for the use of the nobler
races, she appears to have bestowed greater pains in multiplying the number
than in com∣pleting the kind. In this manner, while the elephant, and the
horse, bring forth but one at a time, the spider and the beetle are seen
to produce a thousand: and even among the smaller quadrupedes themselves,
all the inferior kinds are extremely fertile; any one of these being found,
in a very few months, to become the parent of a numerous progeny.</P>
<P>In this manner, therefore, the smallest ani∣mals multiply in the
greatest proportion; and we have reason to thank Providence that the most
formidable animals are the least fruitful. Had the lion and the tyger the
same degree of <PB N="50" REF="52"/> fecundity with the rabbit, or the rat,
all the arts of man would be unable to oppose these fierce invaders; and we
should soon perceive them become the tyrants of those who claim the
lordship of the creation. But Heaven, in this respect, has wisely
consulted the advantage of all. It has opposed to man only such ene∣mies
as he has art and strength to conquer; and as large animals require
proportional sup∣plies, Nature was unwilling to give new life, where it, in
some measure, denied the necessary means of subsistence.</P>
<P>In consequence of this pre-established order, the animals that
are endowed with the most perfect methods of generation, and bring forth but
one at a time, seldom begin to pro∣create till they have almost acquired
their full growth. On the other hand, those which bring forth many, engender
before they have arrived at half their natural size. The horse, and the
bull, come almost to perfection before they begin to generate; the hog, and
the rabbit, scarce leave the tate before they become parents themselves. In
whatever light, therefore, we consider this subject, we shall find that
all creatures approach most to perfection, whose generation most nearly
resembles that of man. <PB N="51" REF="53"/> The reptile produced from cutting
is but one degree above the vegetable. The animal pro∣duced from the egg is
still a step higher in the scale of existence: that class of animals
which are brought forth alive, are still more exalted. Of these, such as
bring forth one at a time are the most complete; and foremost of these
stands man, the great master of all, who seems to have united the
perfections of all the rest in his formation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Infancy of Man.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we take a survey of the various classes of animals, and
examine their strength, their beauty, or their structure, we shall find
man to possess most of those advantages united, which the rest
enjoy partially. Infinitely supe∣rior to all others in the powers of the
under∣standing, he is also superior to them in the fit∣ness and
proportions of his form. He would, indeed, have been one of the most
miserable beings upon earth, if with a sentient mind he was so formed as
to be incapable of obeying its impulse; but Nature has otherwise provided;
as with the most extensive intellects to com∣mand, she has furnished
him with a body the best fitted for obedience.</P>
<P>In infancy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. iv. p.
173.</BIBL></NOTE>, however, that mind, and this body, form the most
helpless union in all ani∣mated nature; and, if any thing can give us a
picture of complete imbecillity, it is a man when just come into the world.
The infant just born stands in need of all things, without the power of
procuring any. The lower races <PB N="53" REF="55"/> of animals, upon being
produced, are active, vigorous, and capable of self-support; but the infant
is obliged to wait in helpless expectation; and its cries are its only aid to
procure sub∣sistence.</P>
<P>An infant just born may be said to come from one element into
another; for from the watery fluid in which it was surrounded, it now
immerges into air; and its first cries seem to imply how greatly it regrets
the change. How much longer it could have continued in a state of almost
total insensibility, in the womb, is impossible to tell; but it is very
probable that it could remain there some hours more. In order to throw some
light upon this subject, Mr. Buffon so placed a pregnant bitch as that her
puppies were brought forth in warm water, in which he kept them above half an
hour at a time. However, he saw no change in the animals, thus newly brought
forth; they con∣tinued the whole time vigorous; and, during the whole time, it
is very probable that the blood circulated through the same channels through
which it passed while they continued in the womb.</P>
<P>Almost all animals have their eyes closed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, for some days after being
brought into the <PB N="54" REF="56"/> world. The infant opens them the
instant of its birth. However, it seems to keep them fixed and idle; they
want that lustre which they acquire by degrees; and if they happen to move,
is is rather an accidental gaze than an ex∣ertion of the act of seeing. The
light alone seems to make the greatest impression upon them. The eyes
of infants are sometimes found turned to the place where it is strongest;
and the pu∣pil is seen to dilate and diminish, as in grown persons, in
proportion to the quantity it re∣ceives. But still, the infant is incapable
of di∣stinguishing objects; the sense of seeing, like the rest of
the senses, requires an habit before it becomes any way serviceable. All
the senses must be compared with each other, and must be made to
correct the defects of one another, before they can give just information. It
is probable, therefore, that if the infant could express its own
sensations, it would give a very extraordinary description of the
illusions which it suffers from them. The sight might, perhaps, be
represented as inverting objects, or multi∣plying them; the hearing,
instead of convey∣ing one uniform tone, might be said to bring up an
interrupted succession of noises; and the touch apparently would divide
one body into as many as there are fingers that grasped it. But 
<PB N="55" REF="57"/> all these errors are lost in one common confused
idea of existence; and it is happy for the infant, that it then can make but
very little use of its senses, when they could serve only to bring it
false information.</P>
<P>If there be any distinct sensations, those of pain seem to
be much more frequent and stronger than those of pleasure. The infant's
cries are sufficient indications of the uneasinesses it must at every
interval endure; while, in the beginning, it has got no external marks to
testify its satisfactions. It is not till after forty days that it is
seen to smile; and not till that time also, the tears begin to appear,
its former expressions of uneasiness being always without them. As to
any other marks of the passions, the infant being as yet almost without
them, it can express none of them in its visage; which, except in the act
of crying and laughing, is fixed in a settled serenity. All the other parts
of the body seem equally relaxed and feeble: its motions are uncertain, and
its postures with∣out choice; it is unable to stand upright; its hams are
yet bent, from the habit which it re∣ceived from its position in the womb; it
has not strength enough in its arms to stretch them for∣ward, much less
to grasp any thing with its hands; it rests just in the posture it is
laid; <PB N="56" REF="58"/> and, if abandoned, must still continue in the
same position.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, though this be the description of infancy among
mankind in general, there are countries, and races, among whom infancy does not
seem marked with such utter imbecillity, but where the children, not long
after they are born, appear possessed of a greater share of
self-support. The children of Negroes have a sur∣prizing degree of this
premature industry: they are able to walk at two months; or, at least, to
move from one place to another: they also hang to the mother's back without
any assist∣ance, and seize the breast over her shoulder, continuing
in this posture till she thinks proper to lay them down. This is very
different in the children of our countries, that seldom are able to walk
under a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>The skin of children newly brought forth, is always red,
proceeding from its transparency, by which the blood beneath appears more
con∣spicuous. Some say that this redness is greatest in those
children that are afterwards about to have the finest complexions; and it
stands to reason that it should be so, since the thinnest skins
are always the fairest. The size of a new∣born infant is generally about
twenty inches, and its weight about twelve pounds. The head <PB N="57" REF="59"/> is large, and all the members delicate, soft, and puffy. These
appearances alter with its age; as it grows older, the head becomes less in
pro∣portion to the rest of the body; the flesh har∣dens; the bones, that
before birth grew very thick in proportion, now lengthen by degrees, and the
human figure more and more acquires its due dimensions. In such children,
however, as are but feeble or sickly, the head always con∣tinues too big for
the body; the heads of dwarfs being extremely large in proportion.</P>
<P>Infants, when newly born, pass most of their time in sleeping,
and awake with crying, ex∣cited either by sensations of pain, or of hunger.
Man, when come to maturity, but rarely feels the want of food, as eating twice
or thrice in the four and twenty hours is known to suffice the most
voracious: but the infant may be consider∣ed as a little glutton, whose
only pleasure con∣sists in its appetite; and this, except when it
sleeps, it is never easy without satisfying. Thus Nature has adapted
different desires to the dif∣ferent periods of life; each as it seems
most ne∣cessary for human support or succession. While the animal
is yet forming, hunger excites it to that supply which is necessary for
its growth; when it is completely formed, a different ap∣petite takes place,
that incites it to communicate <PB N="58" REF="60"/> existence. These two
desires take up the whole attention at different periods, but are very
sel∣dom found to prevail strongly together in the same age; one
pleasure ever serving to repress the other: and, if we find a person of
full age, placing a principal part of his happiness in the nature and
quantity of his food, we have strong reasons to suspect, that with
respect to his other appetites, he still retains a part of the imbecillity
of his childhood.</P>
<P>It is extraordinary enough, however, that in∣fants, who are thus
more voracious than grown persons, are nevertheless more capable of
sustain∣ing hunger. We have several instances, in ac∣cidental cases
of famine, in which the child has been known to survive the parent; and they
have been seen clinging to the breast of their dead mother. Their little
bodies also, are more patient of cold; and we have similar in∣stances of
the mother's perishing in the snow, while the infant has been found alive
beside her. However, if we examine the internal structure of infants, we
shall find an obvious reason for both these advantages. Their
blood-vessels are known to be much larger than in adults; and their nerves
much thicker and softer: thus, being furnished with a more copious quantity
of juices, both of the nervous and sanguinary <PB N="59" REF="61"/> kinds, the
infant finds a temporary sustenance in this superfluity, and does not
expire till both are exhausted. The circulation also being larger and
quicker, supplies it with proportion∣able warmth, so that it is more
capable of re∣sisting the accidental rigours of the weather.</P>
<P>The first nourishment of infants is well known to be the
mother's milk; and, what is remark∣able, the infant itself has milk in its
own breasts, which may be squeezed out by compression: this
nourishment becomes less grateful as the child gathers strength; and
perhaps, also, more unwholesome. However, in cold countries, which are
unfavourable to propagation, and where the female has seldom above three or
four children at the most, during her life, she continues to suckle the
child for four or five years together. In this manner the mothers of Canada and
Greenland are often seen suckling two or three children, of different ages,
at a time.</P>
<P>The life of infants is very precarious, till the age of three or
four, from which time it be∣comes more secure; and when a child arrives at
its seventh year, it is then considered as a more certain life, as Mr.
Buffon asserts, than at any other age whatever. It appears, from
Simpson's Tables, that of a certain number of children <PB N="60" REF="62"/>
born at the same time, a fourth part are found dead, at the end of the
first year; more than two thirds at the end of the second; and, at least,
half, at the end of the third: so that those who live to be above three
years old, are indulged a longer term than half the rest of their
fellow-creatures. Nevertheless, life, at that period, may be considered as
mere animal existence; and rather a preparation for, than an enjoyment of
those satisfactions, both of mind and body, that make life of real value:
and hence it is more natural for mankind to deplore a fellow-creature, cut off
in the bloom of life, than one dying in early infancy. The one, by living up to
youth, and thus wading through the disad∣vantageous parts of existence,
seems to have earned a short continuance of its enjoyments; the infant, on
the contrary, has served but a short apprenticeship to pain; and, when
taken away, may be considered as rescued from a long continuance of
misery.</P>
<P>There is something very remarkable in the growth of the human
body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. iv. p. 173.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
embryo in the womb continues to encrease still more and more, till it is
born. On the other hand, the child's growth is less every year, till the time
of puberty, when it seems to start up of a sudden. <PB N="61" REF="63"/>
Thus, for instance, the embryo, which is an inch long, in the first month,
grows but one inch and a quarter in the second; it then grows one and an half
in the third; two and an half in the fourth; and in this manner it keeps
en∣creasing, till in the last month of its continuance it is actually found
to grow four inches; and, in the whole, about eighteen inches long. But it is
otherwise with the child when born: if we suppose it eighteen inches at
that time, it grows, in the first year, six or seven inches; in the
second year, it grows but four inches; in the third year, about three; and
so on, at the rate of about an inch and an half, or two inches, each year,
till the time of puberty, when Nature seems to make one great last effort,
to complete her work, and unfold the whole animal ma∣chine.</P>
<P>The growth of the mind in children seems to correspond with that
of the body. The comparative progress of the understanding is greater in
infants than in children of three or four years old. If we only reflect a
moment on the amazing acquisitions that an infant makes in the first and
second years of life, we shall have much cause for wonder. Being sent
into a world where every thing is new and unknown, the first months of life
are spent in a kind of <PB N="62" REF="64"/> torpid amazement; an attention
distracted by the multiplicity of objects that press to be known. The
first labour, therefore, of the little learner is, to correct the illusions
of the senses, to distinguish one object from another, and to exert the
memory, so as to know them again. In this manner a child of a year old has
already made a thousand experiments; all which it has properly ranged, and
distinctly re∣members. Light, heat, fire, sweets, and bit∣ters, sounds
soft or terrible, are all distinguished at the end of a very few months.
Besides this, every person the child knows, every individual object it
becomes fond of, its rattles, or its bells, may be all considered as so
many new lessons to the young mind, with which it has not become
acquainted, without repeated exertions of the understanding. At this period
of life, the knowledge of every individual object cannot be acquired without
the same effort which, when grown up, is employed upon the most abstract
idea: every thing the child hears or sees, all the marks and characters of
nature, are as much un∣known, and require the same attention to attain, as if
the reader were set to understand the cha∣racters of an Ethiopic
manuscript: and yet we see in how short a time the little student
begins <PB N="63" REF="65"/> to understand them all, and to give evident marks
of early industry.</P>
<P>It is very amusing to pursue the young mind, while employed in
its first attainments. At about a year old, the same necessities that
first engaged its faculties, encrease, as its acquaint∣ance with nature
enlarges. Its studies, there∣fore, if I may use the expression, are no
way re∣laxed; for having experienced what gave plea∣sure at one time, it
desires a repetition of it from the same object; and, in order to obtain
this, that object must be pointed out: here, therefore, a new necessity
arises, which, very often, neither its little arts nor importunities can
remove; so that the child is at last obliged to set about naming the
objects it desires to possess or avoid. In beginning to speak, which
is usually about a year old, children find a thou∣sand difficulties. It is
not without repeated trials that they come to pronounce any one of the letters;
nor without an effort of the me∣mory, that they can retain them. For this
rea∣son, we frequently see them attempting a sound which they had
learned, but forgot; and when they have failed, I have often seen their
attempt attended with apparent confusion. The letters soonest learned,
are those which are most easily formed; thus A and B require an obvious
dis∣position <PB N="64" REF="66"/> of the organs, and their pronunciation is
consequently soon attained. Z and R, which require a more complicated
position, are learned with greater difficulty. And this may, perhaps, be the
reason why the children in some countries speak sooner than in others;
for the letters mostly occurring in the language of one country, being such
as are of easy pronunciation, that language is of course more easily
attained. In this manner the children of the Italians are said to speak
sooner than those of the Germans; the language of the one being smooth
and open; that of the other, crowded with consonants, and extremely
gutteral.</P>
<P>But be this as it will, in all countries, children are found able to
express the greatest part of their wants by the time they arrive at two
years old; and from the moment the necessity of learning new words
ceases, they relax their in∣dustry. It is then that the mind, like the
body, seems every year to make slow advances; and, in order to spur up
attention, many systems of education have been contrived.</P>
<P>Almost every philosopher who has written on the education of
children, has been willing to point out a method of his own, chiefly
professing to advance the health, and improve the intellects at the same
time. These are usually found to <PB N="65" REF="67"/> begin with finding
nothing right in the common practice; and by urging a total reformation. In
consequence of this, nothing can be more wild or imaginary than their various
systems of improvement. Some will have the children every day plunged in
cold water, in order to strengthen their bodies; they will have them
converse with the servants in nothing but the Latin language, in order to
strengthen their minds; every hour of the day must be appointed for its own
studies, and the child must learn to make these very studies an
amusement; till about the age of ten or eleven it becomes a prodigy of
premature improvement. Quite opposite to this, we have others, whom the
courtesy of man∣kind also calls philosophers: and they will have the
child learn nothing till the age of ten or eleven, at which the former has
attained so much perfection; with them the mind is to be kept empty, until it
has a proper distinction of some metaphysical ideas about truth; and the
promising pupil is debarred the use of even his own faculties, lest they
should conduct him into prejudice and error. In this manner, some men, whom
fashion has celebrated for profound and fine thinkers, have given their
hazarded and untried conjectures, upon one of the most im∣portant subjects
in the world, and the most in∣teresting <PB N="66" REF="68"/> to humanity.
When men speculate at liberty upon innate ideas, or the abstracted
distinctions between will and power, they may be permitted to enjoy their
systems at pleasure, as they are harmless, although they may be wrong;
but when they alledge that children are to be every day plunged in cold water,
and, whatever be their constitution, indiscriminately enured to cold and
moisture; that they are to be kept wet in the feet, to prevent their
catch∣ing cold; and never to be corrected when young, for fear of breaking
their spirits when old; these are such noxious errors, that all
reasonable men should endeavour to oppose them. Many have been the
children whom these opinions, begun in speculation, have injured or
destroyed in practice; and I have myself seen many a little
philosophical martyr, whom I wished, but was unable to relieve.</P>
<P>If any system be now therefore necessary, it is one that
would serve to shew, a very plain point; that very little system is
necessary. The natural and common course of education is in every
respect the best: I mean that in which the child is permitted to play among
its little equals, from whose similar instructions it often gains the
most useful stores of knowledge. A child is not idle because it is
playing about the <PB N="67" REF="69"/> fields, or pursuing a butterfly; it is
all this time storing its mind with objects, upon the nature, the properties,
and the relations of which future curiosity may speculate.</P>
<P>I have ever found it a vain task to try to make a child's learning
its amusement; nor do I see what good end it would answer were it
actually attained. The child, as was said, ought to have its share of play,
and it will be benefited thereby; and for every reason also, it ought to
have its share of labour. The mind, by early labour, will be thus
accustomed to fatigues and subordination; and whatever be the person's
future employment in life, he will be better fitted to endure it: he will be
thus enabled to support the drudgeries of office with content; or to fill up
the vacancies of life with variety. The child, therefore, should by times be
put to its duty; and be taught to know, that the task is to be done, or the
punishment to be endured. I do not object against alluring it to duty by
re∣ward; but we well know, that the mind will be more strongly stimulated
by pain; and both may, upon some occasions, take their turn to operate. In
this manner, a child, by playing with its equals abroad, and labouring with
them at school, will acquire more health and knowledge <PB N="68" REF="70"/>
than by being bred up under the wing of any speculative system-maker; and
will be thus qua∣lified for a life of activity and obedience. It is true,
indeed, that when educated in this manner, the boy may not be so seemingly
sensible and forward as one bred up under solitary instruc∣tion; and,
perhaps, this early forwardness, is more engaging than useful. It is well
known, that many of those children who have been such prodigies of
literature before ten, have not made an adequate progress to twenty. It
should seem, that they only began learning manly things before their time;
and, while others were busied in picking up that knowledge adapted to their
age and curiosity, these were forced upon subjects unsuited to their
years; and, upon that account alone, appearing extra∣ordinary. The stock of
knowledge in both may be equal; but with this difference, that each is yet to
learn what the other knows.</P>
<P>But whatever may have been the acquisitions of children at ten or
twelve, their greatest, and most rapid progress, is made when they arrive
near the age of puberty. It is then that all the powers of nature seem at
work in strengthening the mind, and completing the body: the youth acquires
courage, and the virgin modesty; the <PB N="69" REF="71"/> mind, with new
sensations, assumes new powers; it conceives with greater force, and
remembers with greater tenacity. About this time, there∣fore, which is various
in different countries, more is learned in one year than in any two of the
preceding: and on this age, in particular, the greatest weight of
instruction ought to be thrown.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Puberty.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been often said, that the season of youth is the
season of pleasures: but this can only be true in savage countries,
where but little pre∣paration is made for the perfection of human nature; and
where the mind has but a very small part in the enjoyment. It is otherwise
in those places where nature is carried to the highest pitch of refinement,
in which this season of the greatest sensual delight is wisely made
subservient to the succeeding, and more rational one of manhood. Youth,
with us, is but a scene of preparation; a drama, upon the right conduct of
which all future happiness is to de∣pend. The youth who follows his
appetites, too soon seizes the cup, before it has received its best
ingredients; and, by anticipating his pleasures, robs the remaining parts of
life of their share; so that his eagerness only pro∣duces a manhood of
imbecility, and an age of pain.</P>
<P>The time of puberty is different in various countries, and always
more late in men than in women. In the warm countries, of India, the 
<PB N="71" REF="73"/> women are marriageable at nine or ten, and the men at
twelve or thirteen. It is also dif∣ferent in cities where the inhabitants
lead a more soft, luxurious life, from the country where they work harder,
and fare less deli∣cately. Its symptoms are seldom alike in dif∣ferent
persons; but it is usually known by a welling of the breasts in one
sex, and a rough∣ness of the voice in the other. At this season also,
the women seem to acquire new beauty, while the men lose all that delicate
effeminacy of countenance which they had when boys.</P>
<P>All countries, in proportion as they are ci∣vilized, or barbarous,
improve, or degrade the nuptial satisfaction. In those miserable regions,
where strength makes the only law, the stronger sex exerts its power, and
becomes the tyrant over the weaker: while the inhabitant of Ne∣groland is
indolently taking his pleasure in the fields, his wife is obliged to till the
grounds, that serve for their mutual support. It is thus in all barbarous
countries, where the men throw all the laborious duties of life upon the
wo∣men; and, regardless of beauty, put the softer sex to those
employments that must effectually destroy it.</P>
<P>But, in countries that are half barbarous, particularly wherever
Mahometanism prevails, <PB N="72" REF="74"/> the men run into the very
opposite extreme Equally brutal with the former, they exert their tyranny
over the weaker sex, and consider that half of the human creation as merely
made to be subservient to the depraved desires of the other. The chief,
and indeed the only aim of an Asiatic, is to be possest of many women;
and to be able to furnish a seraglio is the only tendency of his ambition.
As the savage was totally regardless of beauty, he, on the contrary, prizes
it too highly; he excludes the person who is possest of such
personal attractions, from any share in the duties, or employments of life;
and, as if willing to engross all beauty to himself, en∣creases the
number of his captives in proportion to the progress of his fortune. In this
manner he vainly expects to augment his satisfactions, by seeking from many
that happiness which he ought to look for in the society of one alone. He
lives a gloomy tyrant, amidst wretches of his own making; he feels none of
those endearments which spring from affection, none of those de∣licacies
which arise from knowledge. His mi∣stresses, being shut out from the
world, and to∣tally ignorant of all that passes there, have no arts to
entertain his mind, or calm his anxieties; the day passes with them in
sullen silence, or languid repose; appetite can furnish but few
op∣portunities <PB N="73" REF="75"/> of varying the scene; and all that falls
beyond it must be irksome expectation.</P>
<P>From this avarice of women, if I may be al∣lowed to express it
so, has proceeded that jea∣lousy and suspicion which ever attends the
miser: hence those low and barbarous methods of keeping the women of
those countries guard∣ed, and of making, and procuring eunuchs to attend
them. These unhappy creatures are of two kinds, the white and the black. The
white are generally made in the country where they reside, being but partly
deprived of the marks of virility; the black are generally brought from the
interior parts of Africa, and are made en∣tirely bare. These are chiefly
chosen for their deformity; the thicker the lips, the flatter the nose, and
the more black the teeth, the more valuable the eunuch; so that the vile
jealousy of mankind here inverts the order of Nature; and the poor wretch
finds himself va∣lued in proportion to his deficiencies. In Italy, where this
barbarous custom is still retained, and eunuchs are made, in order to
improve the voice, the laws are severely aimed against such practice;
so that being entirely prohibited, none but the poorest, and most
abandoned of the people, still secretly practise it upon their chil∣dren.
Of those served in this manner, not one <PB N="74" REF="76"/> in ten is
found to become a singer; but such is the luxurious folly of the times,
that the suc∣cess of one amply compensates for the failure of the rest.
It is very difficult to account for the alterations which castration makes in
the voice, and the other parts of the body. The eunuch is shaped differently
from others. His legs are of an equal thickness above and below; his knees
weak; his shoulders narrow; and his beard thin and downy. In this manner his
per∣son is rendered more deformed; but his desires, as I am told, still
continue the same; and ac∣tually, in Asia, some of them are found to have
their seraglios, as well as their masters. Even in our country, we have an
instance of a very fine woman's being married to one of them, whose
appearance was the most unpro∣mising; and, what is more extraordinary
still, I am told, that this couple continue perfectly happy in each other's
society.</P>
<P>The mere necessities of life seem the only aim of the
savage; the sensual pleasures are the only study of the
semi-barbarian; but the re∣finement of sensuality, by reason, is the
boast of real politeness. Among the merely barbarous nations, such as the
natives of Madagascar, or the inhabitants of Congo, nothing is desired so
ardently as to prostitute their wives, or <PB N="75" REF="77"/> daughters, to
strangers, for the most trifling advantages; they will account it a
dishonour not to be among the foremost who are thus received into favour;
on the other hand, the Mahometan keeps his wife faithful, by confin∣ing her
person; and would instantly put her to death if he but suspected her
chastity. With the politer inhabitants of Europe both these barbarous
extremes are avoided; the woman's person is left free, and no constraint is
imposed but upon her affections. The passion of love, which may be
considered as the nice conduct of ruder desire, is only known, and
practised in this part of the world; so that what other na∣tions guard as
their right, the more delicate European is contented to ask as a favour. In
this manner, the concurrence of mutual appe∣tite contributes to encrease
mutual satisfaction; and the power on one side of refusing, makes every
blessing more grateful when obtained by the other. In barbarous countries,
woman is considered merely as an useful slave; in such as are
somewhat more refined, she is regarded as a desireable toy; in countries
entirely po∣lished, she enjoys juster privileges; the wife being
considered as an useful friend, and an agreeable mistress. Her mind is
still more prized than her person; and without the im∣provement

<PB N="75" REF="79"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="76" REF="80"/> of both, she can never expect to be∣come truly
agreeable; for her good sense alone can preserve what she has gained by
her beauty.</P>
<P>Female beauty, as was said, is always seen to improve about the
age of puberty: but, if we should attempt to define in what this beauty
con∣sists or what constitutes its perfection, we should find nothing
more difficult to determine. Every country has its peculiar way of thinking, in
this respect; and even the same country thinks differently, at different
times. The ancients had a very different taste from what prevails at
present. The eye-brows joining in the middle was considered as a very
peculiar grace, by Ti∣bullus, in the enumeration of the charms of his
mistress. Narrow foreheads were approved of, and scarce any of the Roman
ladies that are celebrated for their other perfections, but are also
praised for the redness of their hair. The nose also of the Grecian
Venus, was such as would appear at present an actual deformity; as it fell
in a straight line from the forehead, without the smallest sinking
between the eyes; without which we never see a face at present.</P>
<P>Among the moderns, every country seems to have peculiar ideas of
beauty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. The Persians
admire large eye-brows, joining in the middle; <PB N="77" REF="81"/> the edges
and corners of the eyes are tinctured with black, and the size of the head is
encreased by a great variety of bandages, formed into a turban. In some
parts of India, black teeth and white hair, are desired with ardour; and one
of the principal employments of the women of Thibet, is to redden the teeth
with herbs, and to make their hair white by a certain pre∣paration. The
passion for coloured teeth ob∣tains also in China, and Japan; where, to
com∣plete their idea of beauty, the object of desire must have little eyes,
nearly closed, feet ex∣tremely small, and a waist far from being
shapely. There are some nations of the Ame∣rican Indians, that flatten the
heads of their chil∣dren, by keeping them, while young, squeezed between two
boards, so as to make the visage much larger than it would naturally be.
Others flatten the head at top; and others still make it as round as they
possibly can. The inhabitants along the western coasts of Africa, have
a very extraordinary taste for beauty. A flat nose, thick lips, and a jet
black complexion, are there the most indulgent gifts of Nature. Such,
in∣deed, they are all, in some degree, found to possess. However, they
take care, by art, to encrease these natural deformities, as they should
seem to us; and they have many additional <PB N="78" REF="82"/> methods of
rendering their persons still more frightfully pleasing. The whole body
and vi∣sage is often scarred with a variety of mon∣strous figures; which
is not done without great pain, and repeated incision; and even some∣times,
parts of the body are cut away. But it would be endless to remark the various
arts which caprice, or custom, has employed to di∣stort and disfigure the
body, in order to ren∣der it more pleasing: in fact, every nation, how
barbarous soever, seems unsatisfied with the hu∣man figure, as Nature has
left it, and has its peculiar arts of heightening beauty. Painting, powdering,
cutting, boring the nose, and the ears, lengthening the one, and
depressing the other, are arts practised in many countries; and, in
some degree, admired in all. These arts might have been at first
introduced to hide epi∣demic deformities; custom, by degrees, re∣conciles
them to the view; till, from looking upon them with indifference, the eye at
length begins to gaze with pleasure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Age of Manhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This
chapter is translated from Mr. Buffon, whose de∣scription is very
excellent. Whatever I have added is marked by inverted commas, "thus." And in
whatever trifling points I have differed, the notes will serve to
shew.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THE human body attains to its full height during the age of puberty;
or, at least, a short time after. Some young people are found to cease
growing at fourteen, or fifteen; others continue their growth till two or three
and twenty. During this period they are all of a slender make; their thighs
and legs small, and the muscular parts as yet unfilled. But, by degrees,
the fleshy fibres augment; the muscles swell, and assume their
figure; the limbs be∣come proportioned, and rounder; and, before the age of
thirty, the body, in men, has ac∣quired the most perfect symmetry. In
women, the body arrives at perfection much sooner, as they arrive at the age
of maturity more early; the muscles, and all the other parts being weaker,
less compact, and solid, than those of man, they require less time in
coming to per∣fection; and, as they are less in size, that size 
<PB N="80" REF="84"/> is sooner completed. Hence the persons of women are
found to be as complete at twenty, as those of men are found to be at
thirty.</P>
<P>The body of a well-shaped man ought to be square; the muscles
should be expressed with boldness, and the lines of the face strongly
marked. In the woman, all the colours should be rounder, the lines softer,
and the features more delicate. Strength and majesty belong to the man, grace
and softness are the peculiar embellishments of the other sex. In both,
every part of their form declares their sovereignty over other creatures. Man
supports his body erect; his attitude is that of command; and his face, which
is turned towards the heavens, dis∣plays the dignity of his station. The
image of his soul is painted in his visage; and the excellence of his
nature penetrates through the material form in which it is enclosed. His
majestic port, his sedate, and resolute step, announce the nobleness
of his rank. He touches the earth only with his extremity; and beholds it as if
at a disdainful distance. His arms are not given him, as to other
creatures, for pillars of sup∣port; nor does he lose, by rendering them
cal∣lous against the ground, that delicacy of touch which furnishes him
with so many of his enjoy∣ments. His hands are made for very different 
<PB N="81" REF="85"/> purposes; to second every intention of his will, and
to perfect the gifts of Nature.</P>
<P>When the soul is at rest, all the features of the visage
seem settled in a state of profound tran∣quility. Their proportion, their
union, and their harmony seem to mark the sweet serenity of the mind, and
give a true information of what passes within. But, when the soul is
excited, the human visage becomes a living picture; where the passions
are expressed with as much delicacy as energy, where every motion is
de∣signed by some correspondent feature, where every impression
anticipates the will, and be∣trays those hidden agitations, that he would
often wish to conceal.</P>
<P>It is particularly in the eyes that the passions are painted;
and in which we may most readily discover their beginning. The eye seems
to be∣long to the soul more than any other organ; it seems to participate
of all its emotions; as well the most soft and tender, as the most
tumul∣tuous and forceful. It not only receives, but transmits them by
sympathy; the observing eye of one catches the secret fire from another;
and the passion thus often becomes general.</P>
<P>Such persons as are short sighted labour un∣der a particular
disadvantage, in this respect. They are, in a manner, entirely cut off from
<PB N="82" REF="86"/> the language of the eyes; and this gives an air of
stupidity to the face, which often produces very unfavourable preventions.
However in∣telligent we find such persons to be, we can scarcely be
brought back from our first preju∣dice, and often continue in the first
erroneous opinion. In this manner we are too much in∣duced to judge of men by
their physiognomy; and having, perhaps, at first, caught up our judgments
prematurely, they mechanically in∣fluence us all our lives after. This extends
even to the very colour, or the cut of people's cloaths; and we should for
this reason be care∣ful, even in such trifling particulars, since they go
to make up a part of the total judgment which those we converse with may
form to our advantage.</P>
<P>The vivacity, or the languid motion of the eyes, gives the
strongest marks to physiog∣nomy; and their colour contributes still
more to enforce the expression. The different colours of the eye are the
dark hazle, the light hazle, the green, the blue, the grey, the whitish grey,

<Q REND="inline">"and also the red."</Q> These different colours
arise from the different colours of the little 
<Q REND="inline">"muscles that serve to contract the pupil; and
they are very often found to change colour with disorder, and with
age."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="87"/>The most ordinary colours are the hazle and
the blue, and very often both these colours are found in the eyes of the
same person. Those eyes which are called black are only of the dark
hazle, which may be easily seen upon closer inspection; however,
those eyes are reckoned the most beautiful where the shade is the
deepest; and either in these, or the blue eyes, the fire, which gives its
finest expression to the eye, is more distinguishable in propor∣tion
to the darkness of the tint. For this reason, the black eyes, as they are
called, have the greatest vivacity; but, probably, the blue have the most
powerful effect in beauty, as they re∣flect a greater variety of lights, being
composed of more various colours.</P>
<P>This variety, which is found in the colour of the eyes, is peculiar
to man, and one or two other kinds of animals; but, in general, the colour in
any one individual is the same in all the rest. The eyes of oxen are brown;
those of sheep of a water colour; those of goats are grey; 
<Q REND="inline">"and it may also be, in general, re∣marked, that
the eyes of most white animals are red; thus the rabbit, the ferrit, and,
even in the human race, the white Moor, all have their eyes of a red
colour."</Q></P>
<P>Although the eye, when put into motion, <PB N="84" REF="88"/> seems
to be drawn on one side; yet it only moves round its centre; by which its
coloured part moves nearer, or farther from the angle of the eye-lids, or is
elevated or deprest. The distance between the eyes is less in man than in
any other animal; and in some of them it is so great that it is
impossible that they should ever view the same object with both eyes at
once, unless it be very far off. 
<Q REND="inline">"This, however, in them, is rather an advantage than
an inconve∣nience; as they are thus able to watch round them, and guard
against the dangers of their precarious situation."</Q></P>
<P>Next to the eyes, the features, which most give a character to the
face, are the eye-brows; which being, in some measure, more apparent than
the other features, are most readily di∣stinguished at a distance. 
<Q REND="inline">"Le Brun, in giving a painter directions, with
regard to the pas∣sions, places the principal expression of the face in
the eye brows. From their elevation and depression, most of the furious
passions are characterized; and such as have this feature ex∣tremely
moveable, are usually known to have an expressive face. By means of
these we can imitate all the other passions, as they are raised and
depressed, at command; the rest of the fea∣tures are generally fixed; or,
when put into <PB N="85" REF="89"/> motion, they do not obey the will; the mouth
and eyes, in an actor, for instance, may, by being violently distorted,
give a very different expression from what he would intend; but the
eye-brows can scarcely be exerted improperly; their being raised, denotes
all those passions which pride, or pleasure inspire; and their
de∣pression marks those which are the effects of contemplation and pain;
and such who have this feature, therefore, most at command, are often found
to excel as actors."</Q></P>
<P>The eye-lashes have an effect, in giving ex∣pression to the
eye, particularly when long and close; they soften its glances, and improve
its sweetness. Man and apes are the only animals that have eye-lashes
both upon the upper and lower lids; all other animals want them on the lid
below.</P>
<P>The eye-lids serve to guard the ball of the eye, and to furnish
it with a proper moisture. The upper lid rises and falls; the lower has
scarce any motion; and although their being moved depends on the will, yet it
often hap∣pens that the will is unable to keep them open, when sleep, or
fatigue, oppresses the mind. In birds, and amphibious quadrupedes, the
lower lid alone has motion; fishes and insects have no eye-lids
whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="90"/>The forehead makes a large part of the face, and
a part which chiefly contributes to its beauty. It ought to be justly
proportioned; neither too round nor too flat; neither too nar∣row nor too low;
and the hair should come thick upon its extremities. It is known to every
body how much the hair tends to im∣prove the face; and how much the being bald
serves to take away from beauty. The highest part of the head is that which
becomes bald the soonest, as well as that part which lies imme∣diately
above the temples. The hair under the temples, and at the back of the head, is
very seldom known to fail, 
<Q REND="inline">"and women are much less apt to become bald than
men; Mr. Buffon seems to think they never become bald at all; but we have too
many instances of the contrary among us, not very easily to contradict the
assertion. Of all parts, or appendages of the body, the hair is that which
is found most different, in different climates; and often not only
contributes to mark the country, but also the disposition of the man. It
is, in general, thickest where the constitution is strongest; and more
glossy and beautiful where the health is most permanent. The ancients
held the hair to be a sort of excrement, produced like the nails; the part
next the root pushing out that <PB N="87" REF="91"/> immediately contiguous.
But the moderns have found that every hair may be truly said to live, to
receive nutriment, to fill and distend itself like the other parts of the
body. The roots, they observe, do not turn grey sooner than the
extremities, but the whole hair changes colour at once; and we have many
instances of persons who have grown grey in one night's time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon says that the hair begins to grow grey at the points,
but the fact is otherwise.</NOTE>. Each hair, if viewed with a micro∣scope,
is found to consist of five or six lesser ones, all wrapped up in one
common covering; it appears knotted, like some sorts of grass, and
sends forth branches at the joints. It is bulbous at the root, by which it
imbibes its moisture from the body, and it is split at the points; so
that a single hair, at its end, re∣sembles a brush. Whatever be the
size, or the shape of the pore, through which the hair issues, it
accommodates itself to the same; being either thick, as they are large;
small, as they are less; round, triangular, and variously formed as the
pores happen to be various. The hair takes its colour from the juices flow∣ing
through it; and it is found that this co∣lour differs in different tribes and
races of people. The Americans, and the Asiatics, have <PB N="88" REF="92"/>
their hair black, thick, straight, and shining. The inhabitants of the
torrid climates of Africa, have it black, short, and woolly. The people of
Scandinavia have it red, long, and curled; and those of our own, and the
neighbouring countries, are found with hair of various co∣lours. However, it is
supposed by many, that every man resembles in his disposition the
inha∣bitants of those countries whom he resembles in the colour, and the
nature of his hair; so that the black are said, like the Asiatics, to be
grave and acute; the red, like the Gothic na∣tions, to be cholerick and bold.
However this may be, the length and the strength of the hair is a general
mark of a good constitution; and as that hair which is strongest is
most com∣monly curled, so curled hair is generally re∣garded among us as a
beauty. The Greeks, however, had a very different idea of beauty, in this
respect; and seem to have taken one of their peculiar national
distinctions from the length and the straightness of the hair."</Q></P>
<P>The nose is the most prominent feature in the face; but, as it
has scarce any motion, and that only in the strongest passions, it
rather adds to the beauty than to the expression of the countenance. 
<Q REND="inline">"However, I am told, by the skilful in this branch
of knowledge, that wide <PB N="89" REF="93"/> nostrils add a great deal to the
bold and re∣solute air of the countenance; and where they are narrow, though
it may constitute beauty, it seldom improves expression."</Q> The form
of the nose, and its advanced position, are peculiar to the human visage
alone. Other animals, for the most part, have nostrils, with a partition
between them; but none of them have an ele∣vated nose. Apes themselves have
scarce any thing else of this feature, but the nostrils; the rest of
the feature lying flat upon the visage, and scarce higher than the cheek
bones. 
<Q REND="inline">"A∣mong all the tribes of savage men also, the
nose is very flat; and I have seen a Tartar who had scarce any thing
else but two holes through which to breathe."</Q></P>
<P>The mouth and lips, next to the eyes, are found to have the
greatest expression. The passions have great power over this part of
the face; and the mouth marks its different degrees, by its different forms.
The organ of speech still more animates this part, and gives it more life
than any other feature in the countenance. The ruby colour of the lips, and the
white ena∣mel of the teeth, give it such a superiority over every other
feature, that it seems to make the principal object of our regards. In fact,
the whole attention is fixed upon the lips of the <PB N="90" REF="94"/>
speaker; however rapid his discourse, however various the subject, the
mouth takes corre∣spondent situations; and deaf men have been often found
to see the force of those reasonings which they could not hear,
understanding every word as it was spoken.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The under jaw in man possesses a great
va∣riety of motions; while the upper has been thought, by many, to be quite
immoveable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon is of this opinion. He says,
that the upper jaw is immoveable in all animals whatsoever. How∣ever, the
parrot is an obvious exception; and so is man himself, as shewn
above.</NOTE>. However, that it moves in man, a very easy ex∣periment will
suffice to convince us. If we keep the head fixed, with any thing between our
teeth, the edge of a table for instance, and then open our mouths, we shall
find that both jaws recede from it at the same time; the upper jaw rises,
and the lower falls, and the table remains untouched between them. The upper
jaw, therefore, has motion as well as the under; and, what is remarkable, it
has its proper muscles behind the head, for thus raising and depressing
it. Whenever, therefore, we eat, both jaws move at the same time, though very
unequally; for the whole head moving with the upper jaw, of which it makes a
part, its motions are thus <PB N="91" REF="95"/> less observable."</Q> In
the human embryo, the under jaw is very much advanced before the upper. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the adult, it hangs a good deal more backward;
and those whose upper and under row of teeth are equally prominent, and
strike directly against each other, are what the painters call under-hung;
and they consider this as a great defect in beauty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon says, that both jaws, in a perfect face, should be
on a level: but this is denied by the best painters.</NOTE>. The under jaw in
a Chinese face falls greatly more backward than with us; and, I am told, the
difference is half an inch, when the mouth is shut naturally."</Q> In
instances of the most violent passion, the un∣der jaw has often an
involuntary quivering mo∣tion; and often also, a state of languor produces
another, which is that of yawning. 
<Q REND="inline">"Every one knows how very sympathetic this kind of
languid motion is; and that for one person to yawn, is sufficient to set
all the rest of the com∣pany a yawning. A ridiculous instance of this was
commonly practised upon the famous M'Laurin, one of the professors at
Edinburgh. He was very subject to have his jaw dislocated; so that when
he opened his mouth wider than ordinary, or when he yawned, he could not shut
it again. In the midst of his harangues, there∣fore, <PB N="92" REF="96"/> if
any of his pupils began to be tired of his lecture, he had only to gape or
yawn, and the professor instantly caught the sympathetic affection;
so that he thus continued to stand speechless, with his mouth wide
open, till his servant, from the next room, was called in to set his jaw
again."</Q></P>
<P>When the mind reflects with regret upon some good unattained or
lost, it feels an internal emotion, which acting upon the diaphragm, and that
upon the lungs, produces a sigh; this, when the mind is strongly affected,
is repeated; sor∣row succeeds these first emotions; and tears are often
seen to follow: sobbing is the sigh still more invigorated; and
lamentation, or crying, proceeds from the continuance of the plaintive tone of
the voice, which seems to implore pity. 
<Q REND="inline">"There is yet a silent agony, in which the mind
appears to disdain all external help, and broods over its distresses
with gloomy reserve. This is the most dangerous state of mind; accidents
or friendship may lessen the louder kinds of grief; but all remedies for
this, must be had from within: and there, despair too often finds the
most deadly enemy."</Q></P>
<P>Laughter is a sound of the voice, interrupted and pursued for
some continuance. The mus∣cles of the belly, and the diaphragm, are
em∣ployed <PB N="93" REF="97"/> in its slightest exertions; but those of
the ribs are strongly agitated in the louder: and the head sometimes is
thrown backward, in order to raise them with greater ease. The smile is
often an indication of kindness and good-will: it is also often used as a
mark of contempt and ridicule.</P>
<P>Blushing proceeds from different passions; being produced by
shame, anger, pride, and joy. Paleness is often also the effect of anger;
and almost ever attendant on fright and fear. These alterations in the
colour of the coun∣tenance, are entirely involuntary; all the other
expressions of the passions are, in some small de∣gree, under
controul; but blushing and pale∣ness, betray our secret purposes; and
we might as well attempt to stop them, as the circulation of the blood, by
which they are caused.</P>
<P>The whole head, as well as the features of the face, takes peculiar
attitudes from its passions: it bends forward, to express humility,
shame, or sorrow; it is turned to one side, in languor, or in pity; it is
thrown with the chin forward, in arrogance and pride; erect, in self-conceit,
and obstinacy; it is thrown backwards in astonishment; and combines its
motions to the one side, and the other, to express contempt, ridicule,
anger, and resentment. 
<Q REND="inline">"Painters, <PB N="94" REF="98"/> whose study
leads to the contemplation of ex∣ternal forms, are much more adequate judges of
these than any naturalist can be; and it is with these a general remark,
that no one passion is regularly expressed on different countenances in
the same manner; but that grief often sits upon the face like joy; and
pride assumes the air of passion. It would be vain, therefore, in
words, to express their general effect, since they are often as various as
the countenances they sit upon; and in making this distinction nicely, lies
all the skill of the physiognomist. In being able to distinguish what
part of the face is marked by nature, and what by the mind; what part has been
originally formed, and what is made by habit, constitutes this science;
upon which the ancients so much valued themselves, and which we at
present so little regard. Some, however, of the most acute men among us,
have paid great attention to this art; and, by long practice, have been able to
give some cha∣racter of every person whose face they examined. Montaigne
is well known to have disliked those men who shut one eye in looking upon
any ob∣ject: and Fielding asserts, that he never knew a person with a
steady glavering smile, but he found him a rogue. However, most of
these observations, tending to a discovery of the mind 
<PB N="95" REF="99"/> by the face, are merely capricious; and Nature has kindly
hid our hearts from each other, to keep us in good humour with our fellow
creatures."</Q></P>
<P>The parts of the head which give the least expression to the
face, are the ears; and they are generally found hidden under the hair.
These, which are immoveable, and make so small an appearance in man, are
very distin∣guishing features in quadrupedes. They serve in them as the
principal marks of the passions; the ears discover their joys or their
terrors, with tolerable precision; and denote all their internal agitations.
The smallest ears, in men, are said to be most beautiful; but the
largest are found the best for hearing. There are some savage nations
who bore their ears, and so draw that part down, that the tips of the ears
are seen to rest upon their shoulders.</P>
<P>The strange variety in the different customs of men, appears
still more extravagant in their manner of wearing their beards. Some, and
among others the Turks, cut the hair off their heads, and let their beards
grow. The Euro∣peans, on the contrary, shave their beards, and wear their
hair. The Negroes shave their heads in figures at one time, in stars at
another, in the manner of friars; and still more com∣monly in alternate
stripes; and their little boys <PB N="96" REF="100"/> are shaved in the
same manner. The Tala∣poins, of Siam, shave the heads and the eye-brows of
such children as are committed to their care. Every nation seems to have
enter∣tained different prejudices, at different times, in favour of one part or
another of the beard. Some have admired the hair upon the cheeks on each
side, as we see with some low-bred men among ourselves, who want to be
fine. Some like the hair lower down; some chuse it curled; and others like
it strait. 
<Q REND="inline">"Some have cut it into a peak; and others shave
all but the whisker. This particular part of the beard was highly prized
among the Spaniards; till of late, a man without whiskers was considered as
unfit for company; and where Nature had de∣nied them, Art took care to supply
the defi∣ciency. We are told of a Spanish general who, when he borrowed a
large sum of money from the Venetians, pawned his whisker, which he
afterwards took proper care to release. Kingson assures us, that a
considerable part of the re∣ligion of the Tartars consists in the
manage∣ment of their whiskers; and that they waged a long and bloody war with
the Persians, declar∣ing them infidels, merely because they would not give
their whiskers the orthodox cut. The kings of Persia carried the care of
their beards <PB N="97" REF="101"/> to a ridiculous excess, when they chose
to wear them matted with gold thread: and the kings of France themselves, of
the first races, had them knotted and buttoned with gold. But of all nations,
the Americans take the greatest pains in cutting their hair, and plucking
their beards. The under part of the beard, and all but the whisker, they take
care to pluck up by the roots, so that many have supposed them to have no
hair naturally growing on that part: and even Linnaeus himself has fallen
into that mi∣stake. Their hair is also cut into bands; and no small care
employed in adjusting the whisker. In fact, we have a very wrong idea of
savage finery; and are apt to suppose that, like the beasts of the
forest, they rise, and are dressed with a shake: but the reverse is
true; for no birth-night beauty takes more time or pains in the adorning her
person, than they. I remember, when the Cherokee kings were over here, that I
have waited for three hours. during the time they were dressing. They
ne∣ver would venture to make their appearance till they had gone through the
tedious cere∣monies of the toilet; they had their boxes of oil and oker, their
fat, and their perfumes, like the most effeminate beau, and generally took up
four hours in dressing, before they con∣sidered <PB N="98" REF="102"/>
themselves as fit to be seen. We must not, therefore, consider a
delicacy in point of dress, as a mark of refinement, since savages are
much more difficult in this particular, than the most fashionable or tawdry
European. The more barbarous the people, the fonder of finery. In Europe, the
lustre of jewels, and the splen∣dor of the most brilliant colours, are
generally given up to women, or to the weakest part of the other sex, who
are willing to be contempti∣bly fine: but in Asia, these trifling fineries
are eagerly sought after by every condition of men; and, as the proverb has
it, we find the richest jewels in an Aethiop's ear. The passion for
glittering ornaments, is still stronger among the absolute barbarians,
who often exchange their whole stock of provisions, and whatever else
they happen to be possessed of, with our seamen, for a glass bead,
or a looking-glass."</Q></P>
<P>Although fashions have arisen in different countries from fancy
and caprice, these, when they become general, deserve examination. Mankind
have always considered it as a matter of moment, and they will ever continue
desirous of drawing the attention of each other, by such ornaments as mark
the riches, the power, or the courage of the wearer. The value of those
shining stones which have at all times been <PB N="99" REF="103"/>
considered as precious ornaments, is entirely founded upon their
scarceness or their bril∣liancy. It is the same likewise, with
respect to those shining metals, the weight of which is so little
regarded, when spread over our cloaths. These ornaments are rather
designed to draw the attention of others, than to add to any enjoyments of
our own; and few there are that these ornaments will not serve to dazzle,
and who can coolly distinguish between the metal and the man.</P>
<P>All things rare and brilliant, will, therefore, ever continue to be
fashionable, while men de∣rive greater advantages from opulence than virtue;
while the means of appearing consider∣able, are more easily acquired, than
the title to be considered. The first impression we gene∣rally make,
arises from our dress; and this varies, in conformity to our inclinations,
and the manner in which we desire to be considered. The modest man, or he
who would wish to be thought so, desires to shew the simplicity of
his mind, by the plainness of his dress; the vain man, on the contrary,
takes a pleasure in dis∣playing his superiority, 
<Q REND="inline">"and is willing to in∣cur the spectator's
dislike, so he does but excite his attention."</Q></P>
<P>Another point of view which men have in <PB N="100" REF="104"/>
dressing, is to encrease the size of their figure; and to take up more
room in the world than Nature seems to have allotted them. We desire to
swell out our cloaths by the stiffness of art, and raise our heels,
while we add to the large∣ness of our heads. How bulky soever our dress
may be, our vanities are still more bulky. The largeness of the doctor's
wig arises from the same pride with the smallness of the beau's queue.
Both want to have the size of their un∣derstanding measured by the size
of their heads.</P>
<P>There are some modes that seem to have a more reasonable
origin, which is to hide or to lessen the defects of Nature. To take men
al∣together, there are many more deformed and plain, than beautiful and
shapely. The former, as being the most numerous, give law to fashion; and
their laws are generally such as are made in their own favour. The women
begin to colour their cheeks with red, when the na∣tural roses are faded; and
the younger are obliged to submit, though not compelled by the same
necessity. In all parts of the world, this custom prevails more or
less; and powdering and frizzing the hair, though not so general, seems
to have arisen from a similar control.</P>
<P>But leaving the draperies of the human <PB N="101" REF="105"/>
picture, let us return to the figure, unadorned by art. Man's head, whether
considered exter∣nally or internally, is differently formed from that of all
other animals, the monkey-kind only excepted, in which there is a striking
similitude. There are some differences, however, which we shall take
notice of in another place. The bodies of all quadrupede animals are covered
with hair; but the head of man seems the part most adorned; and that more
abundantly than in any other animal.</P>
<P>There is a very great variety in the teeth of all animals; some
have them above and below; others have them in the under jaw only: in some
they stand separate from each other; while in some they are continued and
united. The palate of some fishes is nothing else but a bony plate
studded with points, which perform the offices of teeth. All these
substances, in every animal, derive their origin from the nerves; the
substance of the nerves hardens by being exposed to the air; and the
nerves that terminate in the mouth, being thus exposed, acquire a bony
solidity. In this manner, the teeth and nails are formed in man; and in this
manner also, the beak, the hoofs, the horns, and the talons of other
ani∣mals, are found to be produced.</P>
<P>The neck supports the head, and unites it to <PB N="102" REF="106"/> the body. This part is much more considerable in the generality of
quadrupedes, than in man. But fishes, and other animals that want lungs
similar to ours, have no neck whatsoever. Birds, in general, have the neck
longer than any other kind of animals: those of them, which have short
claws, have also short necks; those, on the contrary, that have them
long, are found to have the neck in proportion. 
<Q REND="inline">"In men, there is a lump upon the wind-pipe, formed
by the thuroid cartilage, which is not to be seen in women; an Arabian fable
says, that this is a part of the original apple, that has stuck in the
man's throat by the way, but that the woman swallowed her part of it
down."</Q></P>
<P>The human breast is outwardly formed in a very different manner
from that of other ani∣mals. It is larger in proportion to the size of the
body; and none but man, and such ani∣mals as make use of their fore feet as
hands, such as monkies, bats, and squirrels, are found to have those
bones called the clavicles, or, as we usually term them, the
collar-bones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon says, that none but monkeys
have them: but this is an oversight.</NOTE>. The breasts in women are
larger than in men; how∣ever, they seem formed in the same manner; and,
sometimes, milk is found in the breasts of <PB N="103" REF="107"/> men, as
well as in those of women. Among ani∣mals, there is a great variety in this
part of the body. The teats of some, as in the ape and the elephant, are like
those of men, being but two, and placed on each side of the breast. The
teats of the bear amount to four. The sheep has but two, placed between the
hinder legs. Other animals, such as the bitch, and the sow, have them all
along the belly; and, as they produce many young, they have a great many teats
for their support. The form also of the teats, varies in different animals;
and, in the same animal, at different ages. The bosom in females, seems
to unite all our ideas of beauty, where the outline is continually changing,
and the gra∣dations are soft and regular.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The graceful fall of the shoulders, both in man
and woman, constitute no small part of beauty. In apes, though otherwise
made like us, the shoulders are high, and drawn up on each side towards the
ears. In man they fall by a gentle declivity; and the more so, in pro∣portion
to the beauty of his form. In fact, being high shouldered, is not without
reason considered as a deformity, for we find very sickly persons are
always so; and people, when dying, are ever seen with their shoulders
drawn up in a surprizing manner. The muscles that <PB N="104" REF="108"/>
serve to raise the ribs, mostly rise near the shoulders; and the
higher we raise the shoul∣ders, we the more easily raise the ribs
likewise. It happens, therefore, in the sickly, and the dying, who do not
breathe without labour, that to raise the ribs, they are obliged to call in
the assistance of the shoulders; and thus their bodies assume, from
habit, that form which they are so fre∣quently obliged to assume. Women
with child also, are usually seen to be high shouldered; for the weight
of the inferior parts drawing down the ribs, they are obliged to use every
effort to elevate them, and thus they raise the shoulders of course.
During pregnancy also, the shape, not only of the shoulders, but also
of the breast, and even the features of the face, are greatly altered: for
the whole upper fore-part of the body is covered with a broad thin skin,
called the myoides; which being, at that time, drawn down, it draws down with
it the skin, and, consequently, the features of the face. By this means,
the visage takes a particular form; the lower eye-lids, and the corners of
the mouth, are drawn downwards; so that the eyes are enlarged, and the mouth
lengthened: and women, in these circumstances, are said, by the midwives,
to be all mouth and eyes."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="109"/>The arms of men but very little resemble the
fore feet of quadrupedes, and much less the wings of birds. The ape is the
only animal that is possessed of hands and arms; but these are much
more rudely fashioned, and with less exact proportion than in men; 
<Q REND="inline">"the thumb not being so well opposed to the
rest of the fingers, in their hands, as in ours."</Q></P>
<P>The form of the back is not much different in man from that of other
quadrupede animals, only that the reins are more muscular in him, and
stronger. The buttock, however, in man, is different from that of all other
animals what∣soever. What goes by that name, in other creatures, is only the
upper part of the thigh: man being the only animal that supports him∣self
perfectly erect, the peculiar largeness of this part is owing to the
peculiarity of his position.</P>
<P>Man's feet also are different from those of all other animals,
those even of apes not excepted. The foot of the ape is rather a kind of
aukward hand; its toes, or rather fingers, are long, and that of the middle
longest of all. This foot also wants the heel, as in man; the sole also
is nar∣rower, and less adapted to maintain the equi∣librium of the body in
walking, dancing, or running.</P>
<P>The nails are less in man than in any other <PB N="106" REF="110"/>
animal. If they were much longer than the extremities of the fingers, they
would rather be prejudicial than serviceable, and obstruct the management
of the hand. Such savages as let them grow long make use of them in fleaing
animals, in tearing their flesh, and such like purposes; however, though
their nails are con∣siderably larger than ours, they are by no means to be
compared to the hoofs, or the claws of other animals. 
<Q REND="inline">"They may sometimes be seen longer, indeed, than
the claws of any animal whatsoever; as we learn that the nails of some of
the learned men in China are longer than their fingers. But these want that
solidity which might give force to their exertions; and could never, in a
state of nature, have served them for annoyance, or defence."</Q></P>
<P>There is little known exactly with regard to the proportion of the
human figure; and the beauty of the best statues is better conceived by
observ∣ing than by measuring them. The statues of antiquity, which were
at first copied after the human form, are now become the models of it; nor is
there one man found whose person any way approaches to those inimitable
perform∣ances that have thus, in one figure, united the perfections of many. It
is sufficient to say that, from being at first models, they are now
become <PB N="107" REF="111"/> orginals; and are used to correct the
deviations in that form from whence they were taken." I will not, however,
pretend to give the pro∣portions of the human body as taken from these, there
being nothing more arbitrary, and which good painters themselves so much
contemn. Some, for instance, who have studied after these, divide the
body into ten times the length of the face, and others into eight. Some pretend
to tell us that there is a similitude of proportion in dif∣ferent parts of
the body. Thus, that the hand is the length of the face; the thumb the length
of the nose; the space between the eyes is the breadth of an eye; that the
breadth of the thigh, at thickest, is double that of the thickest part of
the leg, and treble the smallest; that the arms extended are just as long
as the figure is high; that the legs and thighs are just half the length of
the figure. All this, however, is extremely arbitrary; and the excellence of a
shape, or the beauty of a statue, results from the attitude and
position of the whole, rather than any established measurements, begun
without experience, and adopted by caprice. In general, it may be remarked that
the pro∣portions alter in every age, and are obviously different in the two
sexes. In woman, the shoul∣ders are narrower, and the neck proportionably 
<PB N="108" REF="112"/> longer than in men. The hips also are con∣siderably
larger, and the thighs much shorter than in men. These proportions,
however, vary greatly at different ages. In infancy the upper parts of the body
are much larger than the lower; the legs and thighs do not constitute any
thing like half the height of the whole figure; in proportion as the child
encreases in age, the inferior parts are found to lengthen; so that the
body is not equally divided until it has acquired its full growth.</P>
<P>The size of men varies considerably. Men are said to be tall
who are from five feet eight inches to six feet high. The middle stature is
from five feet five to five feet eight: and these are said to be of small
stature who fall under these measures. 
<Q REND="inline">"However, it ought to be re∣marked, that the same
person is always taller when he rises in the morning, than upon going to
bed at night; and sometimes there is an inch difference; and I have seen
more. Few persons are sensible of this remarkable variation; and, I am
told, it was first perceived, in England, by a recruiting officer. He often
found that that those men whom he had enlisted for sol∣diers, and
answered to the appointed standard at one time, fell short of it when
they came to be measured before the colonel, at the head 
<PB N="109" REF="113"/> quarters. This dimunition in their size pro∣ceeded
from the different times of the day, and the different states of the body
when they hap∣pened to be measured. If, as was said, they were measured
in the morning, after the night's refreshment, they were found to be commonly
half an inch, and very often a whole inch taller than in measured after the
fatigues of the day; if they were measured when fresh, in the country, and
before a long fatiguing march to the regiment, they were found to be an inch
taller than when they arrived at their journey's end. All this is now well
known among those who recruit for the army; and the reason of this
difference of stature is obvious. Between all the joints of the back-bone,
which is composed of several pieces, there is a glutinous liquor
deposited, which serves, like oil in a machine, to give the parts an easy
play upon each other. This lubricating liquor, or synovia, as the
ana∣tomists call it, is poured in during the season of repose, and is
consumed by exercise and em∣ployment; so that in a body, after hard
labour, there is scarce any of it remaining; but all the joints grow stiff,
and their motion becomes hard and painful. It is from hence, therefore, that
the body diminishes in stature. For this moi∣sture being drained away,
from between the nu∣merous <PB N="110" REF="114"/> joints of the back-bone, they
lie closer upon each other; and their whole length is thus very sensibly
diminished; but sleep once more, by restoring the fluid, again swells
the spaces between the joints, and the whole is extended to its former
dimensions. 
<P>"As the human body is thus often found to differ from itself
in size, so it is found to differ in its weight also; and the same
person, with∣out any apparent cause, is found to be heavier at one time
than another. If, after having eaten an hearty dinner, or having drank hard,
the person should find himself thus heavier, it would appear no way
extraordinary; but the fact is, the body is very often found heavier some
hours after eating an hearty meal, than immediately succeeding it. If, for
instance, a person, fatigued by a day's hard labour, should eat a
plentiful supper, and then get himself weighed upon going to bed; after
sleeping soundly, if he is again weighed, he will find himself
considerably heavier than before; and this difference is often found to
amount to a pound, or sometimes to a pound and a half. From whence this
adventitious weight is derived is not easy to conceive; the body, during the
whole night, appears rather plentifully perspiring than imbibing any fluid,
ra∣ther <PB N="111" REF="115"/> losing than gaining moisture: however, we
have no reason to doubt but that either by the lungs, or, perhaps, by a
peculiar set of pores, it is all this time inhaling a quantity of fluid,
which thus encreases the weight of the whole body, upon being weighed the
next morning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this experiment also, the learned
may gather upon what a weak foundation the whole doctrine of Sanc∣torian
perspiration is built: but this disquisition more properly belongs to
medicine than natural history.</NOTE>."</P></Q></P>
<P>Although the human body is externally more delicate than any in of
the quadrupede kind, it is, notwithstanding, extremely muscular: and,
per∣haps, for its size, stronger than that of any other animal
whatsoever. If we should offer to com∣pare the strength of the lion with
that of man, we should consider that the claws of this animal give us a
false idea of its power; we ascribe to its force what is only the effects
of its arms. Those which man has received from Nature are not offensive;
happy had art never furnished him with any more terrible than those which
arm the paws of the lion.</P>
<P>But there is another manner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr.
Buffon calls it a better manner, but this is not the case.</NOTE> of
comparing the strength of man with that of other animals; namely, by the
weights which either can carry. <PB N="112" REF="116"/> We are assured that
the porters of Constanti∣nople, carry burthens of nine hundred pounds weight:
Mr. Desaguliers tells us of a man, who, by distributing weights in such a
manner as that every part of his body bore its share, he was thus able to
raise a weight of two thousand pounds. An horse, which is about seven
times our bulk, would be thus able to raise a weight of fourteen thousand
pounds, if its strength were in the same proportion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon carries this subject no farther; and thus far,
without explanation, it is erroneous.</NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"But, the truth is, an horse will not carry upon
its back, above a weight of two or three hundred pounds; while a man, of
confessedly inferior strength, is thus able to support two thousand.
Whence comes this seeming superiority? The answer is obvious. Because
the load upon man's shoul∣ders is placed to the greatest advantage; while,
upon the horse's back, it is placed at the greatest disadvantage. Let us
suppose, for a moment, the man standing as upright as possible, under
the great load abovementioned. It is obvious that all the bones of his body may
be compared to a pillar supporting a building, and that his muscles have
scarce any share in this dangerous duty. However, they are not entirely
inactive; as man, let him stand never so upright, will 
<PB N="113" REF="117"/> have some bending in the different parts of his body.
The muscles, therefore, give the bones some assistance, and that with
the greatest pos∣sible advantage. In this manner, therefore, a man has
been found to support two thousand weight; but may be capable of
supporting a still greater. The manner in which this is done, is by
strapping the load round the shoulders of the person, who is to bear it
by a machine, something like that by which milk vessels, or water-buckets
are carried. The load being thus placed on a scaffold, on each side,
con∣trived for that purpose, and the man standing erect in the midst, all
parts of the scaffold, ex∣cept that where the man stands, are made to
sink; and thus the man maintaining his posi∣tion, the load, whatever it is,
becomes sus∣pended, and the column of his bones may be fairly said to
support it. If, however, he should but ever so little give way, he must
inevitably drop; and no power of his can raise the weights again. But the
case is very different with re∣gard to a load laid upon an horse. The
co∣lumn of the bones there lies a different way; and a weight of five hundred
pounds, as I am told, would break the back of the strongest horse that
could be found. The great force of an horse, and other quadrupedes, is
exerted <PB N="114" REF="118"/> when the load is in such a position as that
the column of the bones can be properly applied; which is lengthwise. When,
therefore, we are to estimate the comparative strength of an horse, we
are not to try what he can carry, but what he can draw; and, in this case,
his amaz∣ing superiority over man is easily discerned; for one horse
can draw a load that ten men cannot move. And in some cases it happens that
a draft horse draws the better for being somewhat loaded; for, as the
peasants say, the load upon his back keeps him the better to the
ground."</Q></P>
<P>There is still another way of estimating hu∣man strength by
the perseverance and agility of our motions. Men, who are exercised in
run∣ning, outstrip horses; or at least hold their speed for a longer
continuance. In a journey, also, a man will walk down a horse; and, after
they have both continued to proceed for several days, the horse will be
quite tired, and the man will be fresher than in the beginning. The king's
messengers of Ispahan, who are runners by profession, go thirty-six
leagues in fourteen hours. Travellers assure us that the Hotten∣tots
outstrip lions in the chace; and that the savages, who hunt the elk,
pursue with such speed, that they at last tire down, and take it. 
<PB N="115" REF="119"/> We are told many very surprizing things of the great
swiftness of the savages, and of the long journeys they undertake, on
foot, through the most craggy mountains, where there are no paths to direct,
nor houses to entertain them. They are said to perform a journey of twelve
hundred leagues in less than six weeks. 
<Q REND="inline">"But, notwithstanding what travellers report of
this matter, I have been assured, from many of our officers, and
soldiers, who compared their own swiftness with that of the native
Americans, during the last war, that although the savages held out and, as
the phrase is, had better bot∣tom, yet, for a spurt, the Englishmen were
more nimble and speedy."</Q></P>
<P>Nevertheless, in general, civilized man is ignorant of his own
powers; he is ignorant how much he loses by effeminacy; and what might be
acquired by habit and exercise. Here and there, indeed, men are found among
us of extraordinary strength; but that strength, for want of opportunity,
is seldom called into exer∣tion. 
<Q REND="inline">"Among the ancients it was a quality of much greater
use than at present; as in war the same man that had strength
sufficient to carry the heaviest armour, had strength suffi∣cient
also to strike the most fatal blow. In this case, his strength was at
once his protection <PB N="116" REF="120"/> and his power. We ought not to be
surprized, therefore, when we hear of one man terrible to an army, and
irresistible in his career, as we find some generals represented in
ancient hi∣story. But we may be very certain that this prowess was
exaggerated by flattery, and exalted by terror. An age of ignorance is ever an
age of wonder. At such times, mankind, having no just ideas of the human
powers, are willing rather to represent what they wish than what they know;
and exalt human strength, to fill up the whole sphere of their limited
conceptions. Great strength is an accidental thing; two, or three, in a
country, may possess it; and these may have a claim to heroism. But
what may lead us to doubt of the veracity of these accounts is, that the
heroes of antiquity are represented as the sons of heroes; their amazing
strength is delivered down from father to son; and this we know to be
contrary to the course of nature. Strength is not hereditary; although titles
are: and I am very much induced to believe, that this great tribe of heroes,
who are all represented as the de∣scendants of heroes, are more obliged to
their titles than to their strength, for their characters. With regard to the
shining characters in Ho∣mer, they are all represented as princes, and as
the sons of princes; while we are told of <PB N="117" REF="121"/> scarce any
share of prowess whatsoever in the meaner men of the army; who are only
brought into the field for these to protect, or to slaughter. But nothing
can be more unlikely than that those men, who were bred in the luxury of
courts, should be strong; while the whole body of the people, who received
a plainer and simpler edu∣cation, should be comparatively weak. Nothing can
be more contrary to the general laws of nature, than that all the sons of
heroes should thus inherit not only the kingdoms, but the strength of their
forefathers; and we may conclude, that they owe the greatest share of their
imputed strength rather to the dignity of their stations than the force of
their arms; and, like all fortunate princes, their flatterers happened to be
believed. In later ages, indeed, we have some accounts of amazing strength,
which we can have no reason to doubt of. But in these, nature is found to
pursue her ordi∣nary course; and we find their strength acci∣dental. We
find these strong men among the lowest of the people, and gradually
rising into notice, as this superiority had more opportunity of being
seen. Of this number was the Roman tribune, who went by the name of the
second Achilles; who, with his own hand, killed, at different times, three
hundred of the enemy; <PB N="118" REF="122"/> and when treacherously set
upon, by twenty-five of his own countrymen, although then past his sixtieth
year, killed fourteen of them before he was slain. Of this number was Milo,
who, when he stood upright, could not be forced out of his place. Pliny,
also, tells us of one Athanatus, who walked across the stage at Rome,
loaded with a breast plate weigh∣ing five hundred pounds, and buskins of
the same weight. But of all the prodigies of strength, of whom we have any
accounts in Roman history, Maximin, the emperor, is to be reckoned the
foremost. Whatever we are told relative to him is well attested; his
cha∣racter was too exalted not to be thoroughly known; and that very
strength, for which he was celebrated, at last procured him no less a
re∣ward than the empire of the world. Maximin was above nine feet in height,
and the best pro∣portioned man in the whole empire. He was by birth a
Thracian; and, from being a simple herdsman, rose through the gradations
of of∣fice, until he came to be Emperor of Rome. The first opportunity he had
of exerting his strength, was in the presence of all the citizens, in the
theatre, where he overthrew twelve of the strongest men, in wrestling,
and outstript two of the fleetest horses, in running, all in 
<PB N="119" REF="123"/> one day. He could draw a chariot loaden, that two
strong horses could not move; he could break a horse's jaw with a blow of
his fist; and its thigh with a kick. In war he was always foremost, and
invincible; happy had it been for him, and his subjects, if, from being
formi∣dable to his enemies, he had not become still more so to his
subjects; he reigned, for some time, with all the world his enemy; all
mankind wishing him dead, yet none daring to strike the blow. As if fortune
had resolved that through life he should continue unconquerable, he was
killed at last by his own soldiers, while he was sleeping. We have many
other instances, in later ages, of very great strength, and not fewer of
amazing swiftness; but these, merely corporeal perfections, are now
considered as of small ad∣vantage, either in war or in peace. The
in∣vention of gunpowder has, in some measure, levelled down all force to
one standard; and has wrought a total change in human edu∣cation through all
parts of the world. In peace also, the invention of new machines every day,
and the application of the strength of the lower animals to the purposes of
life, have rendered human strength less valuable. The boast of corporeal
force is now, therefore, consigned to savage nations, where those arts 
<PB N="120" REF="124"/> not being introduced, it may still be need∣ful; but,
in more polite countries, few will be proud of that strength which other
animals can be taught to exert to as useful purposes as they. 
<P>"If we compare the largeness and thickness of our muscles
with those of any other animal, we shall find that, in this respect, we
have the advantage; and if strength, or swiftness, de∣pended upon the
quantity of muscular flesh alone, I believe that, in this respect, we
should be more active and powerful than any other. But this is not the
case; a great deal more than the size of the muscles goes to constitute
ac∣tivity, or force; and it is not he who has the thickest legs that can make
the best use of them. Those, therefore, who have written elaborate
treatises on muscular force, and have estimated the strength of animals
by the thick∣ness of their muscles, have been employed to very little
purpose. It is, in general, observed that thin and raw-boned men are always
stronger and more powerful than such as are seemingly more muscular; as
in the former all the parts have better room for their exertions."</P></Q></P>
<P>Women want much of the strength of men; and, in some countries,
the stronger sex have availed themselves of this superiority, in
cruelly <PB N="121" REF="125"/> and tyranically enslaving those who were
made with equal pretensions to a share in all the ad∣vantages life can
bestow. Savage nations oblige their women to a life of continual labour; upon
them rests all the drudgeries of domestic duty; while the husband,
indolently reclined in his hammock, is first served from the fruits of her
industry. From this negligent situation he is seldom rouzed, except by
the calls of appetite, when it is necessary, either by fishing or
hunt∣ing, to make a variety in his entertainments. A savage has no idea of
taking pleasure in ex∣ercise; he is surprized to see an European walk
forward for his amusement, and then return back again. As for his part he
could be con∣tented to remain for ever in the same situation, perfectly
satisfied with sensual pleasures and undisturbed repose. The women,
therefore, of these countries, are the greatest slaves upon earth;
sensible of their weakness, and unable to resist, they are obliged to
suffer those hard∣ships which are naturally inflicted by such as have
been taught that nothing but corporeal force ought to give pre-eminence. It is
not, therefore, till after some degree of refinement, that women are treated
with lenity; and not till the highest degree of politeness, that they are 
<PB N="122" REF="126"/> permitted to share in all the privileges of man. The
first impulse of savage nature is to confirm their slavery; the next,
of half barbarous na∣tions, is to appropriate their beauty; and that, of the
perfectly polite, to engage their affec∣tions. In civilized countries,
therefore, women have united the force of modesty to the power of their
natural charms; and thus obtain that superiority over the mind, which they
are unable to extort by their strength.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of Sleep and Hunger.</HEAD>
<P>AS man, in all the privileges he enjoys, and the powers he is
invested with, has a superiority over all other animals, so, in his
necessities, he seems inferior to the meanest of them all. Nature has
brought him into life with a greater variety of wants and infirmities, than the
rest of her creatures, unarmed in the midst of ene∣mies. The lion has
natural arms; the bear natural cloathing; but man is destitute of all such
advantages; and, from the superiority of his mind alone, he is to supply
the deficiency. The number of his wants, however, were merely given, in order
to multiply the number of his enjoyments; since the possibility of being
de∣prived of any good, teaches him the value of its possession. Were
man born with those ad∣vantages which he learns to possess by
industry, he would very probably enjoy them with a blunter relish: it is by
being naked, that he knows the value of a covering; it is by being exposed to
the weather, that he learns the com∣forts of an habitation. Every want thus
be∣comes a means of pleasure, in the redressing; and that animal that has
most desires, may be <PB N="124" REF="128"/> said to be capable of the
greatest variety of happiness.</P>
<P>Beside the thousand imaginary wants peculiar to man only, there
are two, which he has in common with all other animals; and which he feels in a
more necessary manner than they. These are the wants of sleep and
hunger. Every animal that we are acquainted with, seems to endure the want of
these with much less injury to health, than man; and some are most
sur∣prizingly patient in sustaining both. The little domestic animals
that we keep about us, may often set a lesson of calm resignation, in
sup∣porting want and watchfulness, to the boasted philosopher. They
receive their pittance at uncertain intervals, and wait its coming with
chearful expectation. We have instances of the dog, and the cat, living, in
this manner, without food, for several days; and yet still preserving
their attachment to the tyrant that oppresses them; still ready to exert
their little services for his amusement or defence. But the patience of
these is nothing, to what the animals of the forest endure. As these
mostly live upon ac∣cidental carnage, so they are often known to remain
without food for several weeks together. Nature, kindly solicitous for
their support, has also contracted their stomachs, to suit them for 
<PB N="125" REF="129"/> their precarious way of living; and kindly, while it
abridges the banquet, lessens the ne∣cessity of providing for it. But
the meaner tribes of animals are made still more capable of sustaining
life without food, many of them re∣maining in a state of torpid indifference
till their prey approaches, when they jump upon and seize it. In this manner,
the snake, or the spider, continue, for several months together, to
subsist upon a single meal; and some of the butterfly kinds actually
live upon nothing. But it is very different with man: his wants daily make
their importunate demands; and it is supposed, that he cannot continue to
live four days without eating, drinking, and sleeping.</P>
<P>Hunger is a much more powerful enemy to man than watchfulness, and
kills him much sooner. It may be considered as a disorder that food
removes; and that would quickly be fatal, without its proper antidote. In fact,
it is so terrible to man, that to avoid it he even en∣counters certain death;
and, rather than endure its tortures, exchanges them for immediate
destruction. However, by what I have been told, it is much more dreadful in
its approaches, than in its continuance; and the pains of a fa∣mishing
wretch, decrease as his strength di∣minishes. In the beginning, the
desire of food <PB N="126" REF="130"/> is dreadful indeed, as we know by
experience, for there are few who have not in some degree felt its
approaches. But, after the first or second day, its tortures become less
terrible, and a total insensibility at length comes kindly in to the poor
wretch's assistance. I have talked with the captain of a ship, who was
one of six that endured it in its extremities; and who was the only person
that had not lost his senses, when they received accidental relief. He
as∣sured me, his pains at first were so great, as to be often tempted
to eat a part of one of the men who died; and which the rest of his crew
actually for some time lived upon: he said that, during the continuance of
this paroxysm, he found his pains insupportable; and was desirous, at one
time, of anticipating that death which he thought inevitable: but his pains, he
said, gra∣dually decreased, after the sixth day, (for they had water in
the ship, which kept them alive so long) and then he was in a state
rather of lan∣guor than desire; nor did he much wish for food, except when
he saw others eating; and that for a while revived his appetite, though with
diminished importunity. The latter part of the time, when his health was
almost destroy∣ed, a thousand strange images rose upon his mind; and
every one of his senses began to <PB N="127" REF="131"/> bring him wrong
information. The most fra∣grant perfumes appeared to him to have a foetid
smell; and every thing he looked at, took a greenish hue, and sometimes a
yellow. When he was presented with food by the ship's com∣pany that took
him and his men up, four of whom died shortly after, he could not help
looking upon it with loathing, instead of desire; and it was not till after
four days, that his sto∣mach was brought to its natural tone; when the
violence of his appetite returned, with a sort of canine eagerness.</P>
<P>Thus dreadful are the effects of hunger; and yet when we come to
assign the cause that pro∣duces them, we find the subject involved in
doubt and intricacy. This longing eagerness is, no doubt, given for a very
obvious pur∣pose; that of replenishing the body, wasted by fatigue and
perspiration. Were not men sti∣mulated by such a pressing monitor,
they might be apt to pursue other amusements, with a per∣severance beyond
their power; and forget the useful hours of refreshment, in those more
tempting ones of pleasure. But hunger makes a demand that will not be
refused; and, indeed, the generality of mankind, seldom await the call.</P>
<P>Hunger has been supposed by some to arise 
<PB N="128" REF="132"/> from the rubbing of the coats of the stomach against
each other, without having any inter∣vening substance to prevent their
painful at∣trition. Others have imagined, that its juices, wanting their
necessary supply, turn acrid, or, as some say, pungent; and thus fret
its internal coats, so as to produce a train of the most un∣easy
sensations. Boerhaave, who made his re∣putation in physic, by uniting the
conjectures of all those that preceded him, ascribes hunger to the united
effect of both these causes; and asserts, that the pungency of the
gastric juices, and the attrition of its coats against each other, cause
those pains, which nothing but food can remove. These juices continuing
still to be separated in the stomach, and every moment becoming more
acrid, mix with the blood, and infect the circulation: the circulation being
thus contaminated, becomes weaker, and more con∣tracted; and the whole nervous
frame sympa∣thizing, an hectic fever, and sometimes madness, is produced;
in which state the faint wretch ex∣pires. In this manner, the man who dies of
hunger, may be said to be poisoned by the juices of his own body; and is
destroyed less by the want of nourishment, than by the vitiated qualities
of that which he had already taken.</P>
<P>However this may be, we have but few in∣stances 
<PB N="129" REF="133"/> of men dying, except at sea, of absolute hunger. The
decline of those unhappy creatures who are destitute of food, at land,
being more slow and unperceived. These, from often being in need, and as
often receiving an accidental supply, pass their lives between surfeiting
and repining; and their constitution is impaired by insensible degrees.
Man is unfit for a state of precarious expectation. That share of provident
precaution which incites him to lay up stores for a distant day, becomes
his torment, when totally unprovided against an immediate call. The lower
race of animals, when satisfied, for the instant moment, are perfectly
happy: but it is otherwise with man; his mind anticipates di∣stress, and
feels the pangs of want even before it arrests him. Thus the mind, being
con∣tinually harrassed by the situation, it at length influences the
constitution, and unfits it for all its functions. Some cruel disorder, but
no way like hunger, seizes the unhappy sufferer; so that almost all
those men who have thus long lived by chance, and whose every day may be
considered as an happy escape from famine, are known at last to die in
reality, of a dis∣order caused by hunger; but which, in the common
language, is often called a broken-heart. Some of these I have known
my∣self, <PB N="130" REF="134"/> when very little able to relieve them: and I
have been told, by a very active and worthy magistrate, that the number of
such as die in London for want, is much greater than one would
imagine—I think he talked of two thousand in a year.</P>
<P>But how numerous soever those who die of hunger may be, many
times greater, on the other hand, are the number of those who die by
repletion. It is not the province of the present page to speculate, with
the physician, upon the danger of surfeits; or, with the moralist, upon
the nauseousness of gluttony: it will only be proper to observe, that
as nothing is so pre∣judicial to health as hunger by constraint, so
nothing is more beneficial to the constitution than voluntary abstinence.
It was not without reason that religion enjoined this duty; since it
answered the double purpose of restoring the health oppressed by
luxury, and diminished the consumption of provisions, so that a part
might come to the poor. It should be the bu∣siness of the legistature,
therefore, to enforce this Divine precept; and thus, by restraining one part
of mankind in the use of their super∣fluities, to consult for the benefit
of those who want the necessaries of life. The injunctions for
abstinence are strict over the whole Con∣tinent; and were rigorously
observed, even <PB N="131" REF="135"/> among ourselves, for a long time
after the Reformation. Queen Elizabeth, by giving her commands, upon this head
the air of a political injunction, lessened, in a great measure, and, in
my opinion, very unwisely, the religious force of the obligation. She
enjoined that her sub∣jects should fast from flesh on fridays and
sa∣turdays; but at the same time declared, that this was not commanded from
motives of re∣ligion, as if there were any differences in meats, but merely to
favour the consumption of fish, and thus to multiply the number of
mariners; and also to spare the stock of sheep, which might be more
beneficial in another way. In this manner the injunction defeated its own
force; and this most salutary law became no longer binding, when it was
supposed to come purely from man. How far it may be enjoined in the
Scriptures, I will not take upon me to say; but this may be asserted,
that if the utmost benefit to the individual, and the most extensive
advantage to society, serve to mark any insti∣tution as of Heaven, this
of abstinence may be reckoned among the foremost.</P>
<P>Were we to give an history of the various benefits that have
arisen from this command, and how conducive it has been to long life, the
in∣stances would fatigue with their multiplicity. <PB N="132" REF="136"/> It
is surprizing to what a great age the pri∣mitive Christians of the East,
who retired from persecution in the desarts of Arabia, continued to live,
in all the bloom of health, and yet all the rigours of abstemious
discipline. Their common allowance, as we are told, for four and twenty
hours, was twelve ounces of bread, and nothing but water. On this simple
beverage, St. Anthony is said to have lived an hundred and five years; James,
the hermit, an hundred and four; Arsenius, tutor to the emperor Ar∣cadius, an
hundred and twenty; St. Epiphanius, an hundred and fifteen; Simeon, an hundred
and twelve; and Rombald, an hundred and twenty. In this manner did these holy
tem∣perate men live to an extreme old age, kept chearful by strong hopes, and
healthful by mo∣derate labour.</P>
<P>Abstinence which is thus voluntary, may be much more easily
supported than constrained hunger. Man is said to live without food for
seven days; which is the usual limit assigned him: and, perhaps, in a
state of constraint, this is the longest time he can survive the want
of it. But in cases of voluntary abstinence, of sickness, or
sleeping, he has been known to live much longer.</P>
<P>In the records of the Tower, there is an ac∣count of a Scotchman,
imprisoned for felony, <PB N="133" REF="137"/> who, for the space of six
weeks, took not the least sustenance, being exactly watched during the
whole time; and for this he received the king's pardon.</P>
<P>When the American Indians undertake long journies, and when,
consequently, a stock of provisions sufficient to support them the
whole way, would be more than they could carry, in order to obviate this
inconvenience, instead of carrying the necessary quantity, they contrive
a method of palliating their hunger, by swallow∣ing pills, made of calcined
shells and tobacco. These pills take away all appetite, by produc∣ing a
temporary disorder in the stomach; and, no doubt, the frequent repetition
of this wretched expedient, must at last be fatal. By this means, however,
they continue several days without eating, chearfully bearing such extremes
of fatigue and watching, as would quickly destroy men bred up in a greater
state of delicacy. For those arts by which we learn to obviate our
ne∣cessities, do not fail to unfit us for their ac∣cidental encounter.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, therefore, man is less able to support hunger
than any other animal; and he is not better qualified to support a state of
watchfulness. Indeed, sleep seems much more necessary to him, than to
any other creature; <PB N="134" REF="138"/> as, when awake, he may be said to
exhaust a greater proportion of the nervous fluid; and, consequently, to
stand in need of an adequate supply. Other animals, when most awake, are
but little removed from a state of slumber; their feeble faculties,
imprisoned in matter, and rather exerted by impulse than deliberation,
require sleep rather as a cessation from motion, than from thinking. But
it is otherwise with man; his ideas, fatigued with their various
excursions, demand a cessation, not less than the body, from toil; and
he is the only creature that seems to require sleep from double motives;
not less for the refreshment of the mental, than of the bodily frame.</P>
<P>There are some lower animals, indeed, that seem to spend the
greatest part of their lives in sleep; but, properly speaking, the
sleep of such may be considered as a kind of death; and their waking, a
resurrection. Flies, and insects, are said to be asleep, at a time that
all the vital motions have ceased; without respiration, with∣out any
circulation of their juices, if cut in pieces, they do not awake, nor does any
fluid ooze out at the wound. These may be con∣sidered rather as congealed
than as sleeping animals; and their rest, during winter, rather as a
cessation from life, than a necessary refresh∣ment: 
<PB N="135" REF="139"/> but in the higher races of animals, whose blood is not
thus congealed, and thawed by heat, these all bear the want of sleep much
better than man; and some of them continue a long time without seeming to
take any refreshment from it whatsoever.</P>
<P>But man is more feeble; he requires its due return; and if it fails
to pay the accustomed visit, his whole frame is in a short time thrown
into disorder: his appetite ceases; his spirits are dejected; his pulse
becomes quicker and harder; and his mind, abridged of its slum∣bering
visions, begins to adopt waking dreams. A thousand strange phantoms
arise, which come and go without his will: these, which are transient in
the beginning, at last take firm possession of the mind, which yields
to their dominion, and, after a long struggle, runs into confirmed madness.
In that horrid state, the mind may be considered as a city without walls,
open to every insult, and paying homage to every invader every idea that then
starts with any force, becomes a reality; and the reason, over fatigued
with its former impor∣tunities, makes no head against the tyran∣nical
invasion, but submits to it from mere imbecillity.</P>
<P>But it is happy for mankind, that this state <PB N="136" REF="140"/> of inquietude is seldom driven to an extreme; and that there are
medicines, which seldom fail to give relief. However, man finds it more
difficult than any other animal to procure sleep: and some are obliged to
court its approaches for several hours together, before they incline to
rest. It is in vain that all light is excluded; that all sounds are
removed; that warmth and softness conspire to invite it; the restless
and busy mind still retains its former activity; and reason, that
wishes to lay down the reins, in spite of herself, is obliged to maintain
them. In this disagreeable state, the mind passes from thought to
thought, willing to lose the distinct∣ness of perception, by encreasing
the multitude of the images. At last, when the approaches of sleep are
near, every object of the imagination begins to mix with that next it; their
outlines become, in a manner, rounder; a part of their distinctions fade
away; and sleep, that ensues, fashions out a dream from the
remainder.</P>
<P>If then it should be asked from what cause this state of
repose proceeds, or in what man∣ner sleep thus binds us for several hours
to∣gether, I must fairly confess my ignorance, although it is easy to
tell what philosophers say upon the subject. Sleep, says one of
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rohault.</BIBL></NOTE>, 
<PB N="137" REF="141"/> consists in a scarcity of spirits, by which the
orifices or pores of the nerves in the brain, through which the spirits
used to flow into the nerves, being no longer kept open by the fre∣quency of
the spirits, shut of themselves; thus the nerves, wanting a new supply
of spirits, become lax, and unfit to convey any impression to the brain.
All this, however, is explaining a very great obscurity by somewhat more
ob∣scure: leaving, therefore, those spirits to open and shut the
entrances to the brain, let us be contented with simply enumerating the
effects of sleep upon the human constitution.</P>
<P>In sleep, the whole nervous frame is re∣laxed, while the heart and
the lungs seem more forcibly exerted. This fuller circulation pro∣duces
also a swelling of the muscles, as they al∣ways find who steep with
ligatures on any part of their body. This encreased circulation also, may
be considered as a kind of exercise, which is continued through the frame;
and, by this, the perspiration becomes more copious, al∣though the appetite
for food is entirely taken away. Too much sleep dulls the apprehension,
weakens the memory, and unfits the body for labour. On the contrary, sleep
too much abridged, emaciates the frame, produces me∣lancholy, and consumes
the constitution. It requires some care, therefore, to regulate the 
<PB N="138" REF="142"/> quantity of sleep, and just to take as much as will
completely restore Nature, without op∣pressing it. The poor, as Otway
says, sleep little; forced, by their situation, to lengthen out their
labour to their necessities, they have but a short interval for this
pleasing refreshment; and I have ever been of opinion, that bodily labour
demands a less quantity of sleep than mental. Labourers and artizans are
generally satisfied with about seven hours; but I have known some
scholars who usually slept nine, and per∣ceived their faculties no way
impaired by over∣sleeping.</P>
<P>The famous Philip Barrettiere, who was considered as a prodigy of
learning at the age of fourteen, was known to sleep regularly twelve hours in
the twenty-four; the extreme activity of his mind, when awake, in some
mea∣sure called for an adequate alternation of re∣pose: and, I am apt to
think, that when stu∣dents stint themselves in this particular, they
lessen the waking powers of the imagination, and unfit it for its most
strenuous exertions. Animals, that seldom think, as was said, can very
easily dispense with sleep; and of men, such as think least, will
very probably be sa∣tisfied with the smallest share. A life of study,
it is well known, unfits the body for receiving this gentle refreshment; the
approaches of <PB N="139" REF="143"/> sleep are driven off by thinking: when,
there∣fore, it comes at last, we should not be too ready to interrupt its
continuance.</P>
<P>Sleep is, indeed, to some, a very agreeable period of their
existence: and it has been a question in the schools, which was most
happy, the man who was a beggar by night, and a king by day; or he who was a
beggar by day, and a king by night? It is given in favour of the nightly
monarch, by him who first started the question: for the dream, says he,
gives the full enjoyment of the dignity, without its attendant inconveniences;
while, on the other hand, the king, who supposes himself degraded, feels
all the misery of his fallen fortune, without trying to find the comforts of
his humble situation. Thus, by day, both states have their peculiar
distresses: but, by night, the exalted beggar is perfectly blessed,
and the king completely mi∣serable. All this, however, is rather fanciful
than just; the pleasure dreams can give us, sel∣dom reaches to our waking
pitch of happiness: the mind often, in the midst of its highest
vi∣sionary satisfactions, demands of itself, whether it does not owe them
to a dream; and fre∣quently awakes with the reply.</P>
<P>But it is seldom, except in cases of the highest delight, or
the most extreme uneasiness, that <PB N="140" REF="144"/> the mind has
power thus to disengage itself from the dominion of fancy. In the ordinary
course of its operations, it submits to those numberless phantastic
images that succeed each other, and which, like many of our waking thoughts,
are generally forgotten. Of these, however, if any, by their oddity, or their
con∣tinuance, affect us strongly, they are then re∣membered; and there have
been some who felt their impressions so strongly, as to mistake
them for realities, and to rank them among the past actions of their
lives.</P>
<P>There are others, upon whom dreams seem to have a very different
effect; and who, with∣out seeming to remember their impressions the next
morning, have yet shewn, by their actions during sleep, that they were very
powerfully impelled by their dominion. We have num∣berless instances of
such persons, who, while asleep, have performed many of the ordinary
duties to which they had been accustomed when waking; and, with a ridiculous
industry, have completed by night, what they failed doing by day. We are
told, in the German ephemerides, of a young student, who being enjoined a
severe exercise by his tutor, went to bed, despairing of accomplishing
it. The next morning, awaking, to his great surprize he found the task
fairly <PB N="141" REF="145"/> written out, and finished in his own
hand∣writing. He was at first, as the account has it, induced to ascribe
this strange production to the operations of an infernal agent; but his
tutor, willing to examine the affair to the bot∣tom, set him another
exercise, still more severe than the former; and took precautions to
ob∣serve his conduct the whole night. The young gentleman, upon being so
severely tasked, felt the same inquietude that he had done on the former
occasion; went to bed gloomy and pen∣sive, pondering on the next day's
duty, and, after some time, fell asleep. But shortly after, his tutor,
who continued to observe him from a place that was concealed, was surprized
to see him get up, and very deliberately go to the table; there he took out
pen, ink, and paper, drew himself a chair, and sate very methodically to
thinking: it seems, that his being asleep, only served to strengthen
the powers of his imagination; for he very quickly and easily went through
the task assigned him, put his chair aside, and then returned to bed to
take out the rest of his nap. What credit we are to give to this account, I
will not pretend to de∣termine: but this may be said, that the book from
whence it is taken, has some good marks of veracity; for it is very learned,
and very dull, <PB N="142" REF="146"/> and is written in a country well noted,
if not for truth, at least for want of invention.</P>
<P>The ridiculous history of Arlotto is well known, who has had a
volume written, contain∣ing a narrative of the actions of his life, not one of
which was performed while he was awake. He was an Italian Franciscan friar,
extremely rigid in his manners, and remarkably devout and learned in his daily
conversation. By night, however, and during his sleep, he played a very
different character from what he did by day, and was often detected in very
at∣trocious crimes. He was at one time detected in actually attempting a rape,
and did not awake till the next morning, when he was sur∣prized to find
himself in the hands of justice. His brothers of the convent often watched
him while he went very deliberately into the cha∣pel, and there attempted to
commit sacrilege. They sometimes permitted him to carry the chalice and the
vestments away into his own chamber, and the next morning amused
them∣selves at the poor man's consternation for what he had done. But of
all his sleeping trans∣gressions, that was the most ridiculous, in
which he was called to pray for the soul of a person departed. Arlotto,
after having very devoutly performed his duty, retired to a cham∣ber 
<PB N="143" REF="147"/> which was shewn him, to rest; but there he had no
sooner fallen asleep, than he began to reflect that the dead body had got a
ring upon one of the fingers, which might be useful to him: accordingly, with
a pious resolution of stealing it, he went down, undressed as he was,
into a room full of women, and, with great composure, endeavoured to seize
the ring. The consequence was, that he was taken before the inquisition for
witchcraft; and the poor creature had like to have been condemned, till his
pe∣culiar character accidentally came to be known: however, he was ordered to
remain for the rest of life in his own convent, and upon no account
whatsoever to stir abroad.</P>
<P>What are we to say to such actions as these; or how account
for this operation of the mind in dreaming? It should seem, that the
ima∣gination, by day, as well as by night, is always employed; and that often,
against our wills, it intrudes where it is least commanded or de∣sired.
While awake, and in health, this busy principle cannot much delude us: it may
build castles in the air, and raise a thousand phantoms before us; but we
have every one of the senses alive, to bear testimony to its falsehood.
Our eyes shew us that the prospect is not present; our hearing, and our
touch, depose against its <PB N="144" REF="148"/> reality; and our taste
and smelling are equally vigilant in detecting the impostor. Reason,
therefore, at once gives judgment upon the cause; and the vagrant intruder,
imagination, is imprisoned, or banished from the mind. But in sleep it is
otherwise; having, as much as possible, put our senses from their
duty, having closed the eyes from seeing, and the ears, taste, and
smelling, from their peculiar functions, and having diminished even the
touch itself, by all the arts of softness, the imagination is then left
to riot at large, and to lead the understanding without an opposer. Every
incursive idea then becomes a reality; and the mind, not having one power
that can prove the illusion, takes them for truths. As in madness, the
senses, from struggling with the imagination, are at length forced to
submit, so, in sleep, they seem for a while soothed into the like
submission: the smallest violence exerted upon any one of them,
however, rouzes all the rest in their mu∣tual defence; and the imagination,
that had for a while told its thousand falshoods, is totally driven away,
or only permitted to pass under the custody of such as are every moment
ready to detect its imposition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of Seeing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapter is
taken from Mr. Buffon. I believe the reader will readily excuse any apology;
and, perhaps, may wish that I had taken this liberty much more fre∣quently.
What I add is marked, as in a former instance, with inverted commas,
"thus."</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"HAVING mentioned the senses as cor∣recting the
errors of the imagination, and as forcing it, in some measure, to bring us
just information, it will naturally follow that we should examine the
nature of those senses them∣selves: we shall thus be enabled to see
how far they also impose on us, and how far they contribute to correct each
other. Let it be observed, however, that in this we are nei∣ther giving a
treatise of optics, or phonics, but an history of our own perceptions; and
to those we chiefly confine ourselves."</Q></P>
<P>The eyes very soon begin to be formed in the human embryo, and in
the chicken also. Of all the parts which the animal has double, the eyes are
produced the soonest, and appear the most prominent. It is true, indeed,
that in vivi∣parous animals, and particularly in man, they 
<PB N="146" REF="150"/> are not so large in proportion, at first, as in the
oviparous kinds; nevertheless, they are more speedily developed, when they
begin to appear, than any other parts of the body. It is the same with the
organ of hearing; the little bones that go to compose the internal parts of
the ear, are entirely formed before the other bones, though much larger, have
acquired any part of their growth, or solidity. Hence it appears, that
those parts of the body which are fur∣nished with the greatest quantity
of nerves, are the first in forming. Thus the brain, and the spinal marrow,
are the first seen begun in the embryo; and, in general, it may be said,
that wherever the nerves go, or send their branches in great numbers, there
the parts are soonest begun, and the most completely finished.</P>
<P>If we examine the eyes of a child some hours, or even some days
after its birth, it will be easily discerned that it, as yet, makes no
use of them. The humours of the organ not hav∣ing as yet acquired a
sufficient consistence, the rays of light strike but confusedly upon
the retina, or expansion of nerves at the back of the eye. It is not till
about a month after they are born, that children fix them upon objects; for,
before that time, they turn them indiscriminately every where, without
appearing <PB N="147" REF="151"/> to be affected by any. At six, or seven
weeks old, they plainly discover a choice in the objects of their attention;
they fix their eyes upon the most brilliant colours, and seem peculiarly
de∣sirous of turning them towards the light. Hi∣therto, however, they only
seem to fortify the organ for seeing distinctly; but they have still
many illusions to correct.</P>
<P>The first great error in vision is, that the eye inverts every
object; and it in reality appears to the child, until the touch has served to
un∣deceive it, turned upside down. A second er∣ror in vision is, that
every object appears double. The same object forms itself distinctly upon
each eye; and is consequently seen twice. This er∣ror, also, can only be
corrected by the touch; and although, in reality, every object we see appears
inverted, and double, yet the judg∣ment, and habit, have so often corrected
the sense, that we no longer submit to its imposi∣tion, but see every
object in its just position, the very instant it appears. Were we,
there∣fore, deprived of feeling, our eyes would not only misrepresent the
situation, but also the number of all things round us.</P>
<P>To convince us that we see objects inverted, we have only to
observe the manner in which images are represented, coming through a
small <PB N="148" REF="152"/> hole, in a darkened room. If such a small
hole be made in a dark room, so that no light can come in, but through that,
all the objects without will be painted on the wall behind, but in an inverted
position, their heads downwards. For as all the rays which pass from the
different parts of the object without, cannot enter the hole in the same
extent which they had in leav∣ing the object, since, if so, they would
require the apperture to be as large as the object; and, as each part, and
every point of the object, sends forth the image of itself on every side,
and the rays, which form these images, pass from all points of the object
as from so many centres, so such only can pass through the small
apperture as come in opposite directions. Thus the little apperture becomes a
centre for the entire ob∣ject; through which the rays from the upper parts, as
well as from the lower parts of it, pass in converging directions; and,
conse∣quently, they must cross each other in the cen∣tral point, and thus
paint the objects behind, upon the wall, in an inverted position.</P>
<P>It is, in like manner, easy to conceive, that we see all objects
double, whatever our present sensations may seem to tell us to the
contrary. For, to convince us of this, we have only to compare the situation
of any one object on <PB N="149" REF="153"/> shutting one eye, and then
compare the same situation by shutting the other. If, for instance, we
hold up a finger, and shut the right eye, we shall find it hide a certain
part of the room; if again reshutting the other eye, we shall find that
part of the room visible, and the finger seeming to cover a part of the
room that had been visible before. If we open both eyes, however, the part
covered will appear to lie between the two extremes. But, the truth is, we
see the object, our finger had covered, one image of it to the right, and the
other to the left; but, from habit, suppose that we see but one image
placed between both; our sense of feeling having corrected the errors of
sight. And thus, also, if instead of two eyes we had two hundred, we
should, at first, fancy the objects encreased in proportion, until one
sense had corrected the errors of another.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The having two eyes might thus be said to be
rather an inconvenience than a benefit, since one eye would answer the
purposes of sight as well, and be less liable to illusion. But it is
other∣wise; two eyes greatly contribute, if not to di∣stinct, at least to
extensive vision<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lenoardo da
Vinci.</BIBL></NOTE>. When an object is placed at a moderate distance, by the
means of both eyes we see a larger share of it <PB N="150" REF="154"/> than
we possibly could with one; the right eye seeing a greater portion of its
right side, and the left eye of its correspondent side. Thus both eyes,
in some measure, see round the ob∣ject; and it is this that gives it, in
nature, that bold relievo, or swelling, with which they appear; and which no
painting, how exquisite soever, can attain to. The painter must be
contented with shading on a flat surface; but the eyes, in observing
nature, do not behold the shading only, but a part of the figure also, that
lies behind those very shadings, which gives it that swelling, which
painters so ardently de∣sire, but can never fully imitate." 
<P>"There is another defect, which either of the eyes, taken
singly, would have, but which is corrected, by having the organ double. In
either eye there is a point, which has no vision whatsoever; so that if
one of them only is em∣ployed in seeing, there is a part of the object to
which it is always totally blind. This is that part of the optic nerve where
its vein and artery run; which being insensible, that point of the object
that is painted there must continue unseen. To be convinced of this we have
only to try a very easy experiment. If we take three black patches, and
stick them upon a white wall, about a foot distant from each 
<PB N="151" REF="155"/> other, each about as high as the eye that is to
observe them; then retiring six or seven feet back, and shutting one
eye, by trying for some time, we shall find, that while we distinctly
be∣hold the black spots that are to the right and left, that which is in the
middle remains to∣tally unseen. Or, in other words, when we bring that part
of the eye, where the optic ar∣tery runs, to fall upon the object, it will then
become invisible. This defect, however, in either eye, is always corrected by
both, since the part of the object that is unseen by one, will be very
distinctly perceived by the other."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Beside the former defects we can have no idea of distances from
the sight, without the help of touch. Naturally every object we see appears
to be within our eyes; and a child, who has as yet made but little use of the
sense of feeling, must suppose that every thing it sees makes a
part of itself. Such objects are only seen more or less bulky as they
approach, or recede from its eyes; so that a fly that is near will ap∣pear
larger than an ox at a distance. It is ex∣perience alone that can rectify
this mistake; and a long acquaintance with the real size of every object,
quickly assures us of the distance at which it is seen. The last man
in a file of sol∣diers appears in reality much less, perhaps ten 
<PB N="152" REF="156"/> times more diminutive, than the man next to us; however,
we do not perceive this difference, but continue to think him of equal
stature; for the numbers we have seen thus lessened by di∣stance, and
have found, by repeated experience, to be of the natural size, when we come
closer, instantly corrects the sense, and every object is perceived
with nearly its natural proportion. But it is otherwise, if we observe
objects in such situations as we have not had sufficient expe∣rience to
correct the errors of the eye; if, for instance, we look at men from the top
of an high steeple, they, in that case, appear very much diminished, as
we have not had an habit of correcting the sense in that position.</P>
<P>Although a small degree of reflection will serve to convince us
of the truth of these po∣sitions, it may not be amiss to strengthen
them by an authority which cannot be disputed. Mr. Cheselden having couched
a boy of thirteen for a cataract, who had hitherto been blind, and thus at once
having restored him to sight, curiously marked the progress of his
mind, upon that occasion. This youth, though he had been till then incapable
of seeing, yet was not totally blind, but could tell day from night, as
persons in his situation always may. He could also, with a strong
light, distinguish black <PB N="153" REF="157"/> from white, and either from
the vivid colour of scarlet; however, he saw nothing of the form of bodies;
and, without a bright light, not even colours themselves. He was, at first,
couched only in one of his eyes; and, when he saw for the first time, he
was so far from judg∣ing of distances, that he supposed that his eyes
touched every object that he saw, in the same manner as his hands might be
said to feel them. The objects that were most agreeable to him were such
as were of plain surfaces and regular figures; tho' he could as yet make no
judg∣ment whatever of their different forms, nor give a reason why one
pleased him more than ano∣ther. Although he could form some idea of colours
during his state of blindness, yet that was not sufficient to direct him
at present; and he could scarcely be persuaded that the colours he now
saw were the same with those he had for∣merly conceived such erroneous
ideas of. He delighted most in green; but black objects, as if giving him an
idea of his former blindness, he regarded with horror. He had, as was said,
no idea of forms; and was unable to distinguish one object from another,
though never so dif∣ferent. When those things were shown him, which he
had been formerly familiarized to, by his feeling, he beheld them with
earnestness, in <PB N="154" REF="158"/> order to remember them a second
time; but, as he had too many to recollect at once, he for∣got the greatest
number; and for one he could tell, after seeing, there was a thousand he
was totally unacquainted with. He was very much much surprized to find that
these things and persons he loved best were not the most beauti∣ful to
be seen; and even testified displeasure in not finding his parents so
handsome as he con∣ceived them to be. It was near two months before he could
find that a picture resembled a solid body. Till then he only considered
it as a flat surface, variously shadowed; but, when he began to perceive
that these kind of shadings actually represented human beings, he then
be∣gan to examine, by his touch, whether they had not the usual qualities of
such bodies, and was greatly surprized to find, what he expected a very
unequal surface to be smooth and even. He was then shewn a miniature
picture of his father, which was contained in his mother's watch-case, and he
readily perceived the resemblance; but asked, with great astonishment,
how so large a face could be contained in so small a compass. It
seemed as strange to him as if a bushel was contained in a pint
vessel. At first, he could bear but a very small quantity of light, and
he saw every object much greater than the life; <PB N="155" REF="159"/> but,
in proportion as he saw objects that were really large, he seemed to think
the former were diminished; and although he knew the chamber where he was
contained in the house, yet, until he saw the latter, he could not be
brought to conceive how an house could be larger than a chamber. Before the
opera∣tion he had no great expectations from the pleasure he should receive
from a new sense; he was only excited by the hopes of being able to read
and write; he said, for instance, that he could have no greater pleasure
in walking, in the garden, with his sight than he had with∣out it, for he
walked there at his ease, and was acquainted with all the walks. He re∣marked
also, with great justice, that his former blindness gave him one
advantage over the rest of mankind, which was that of being able to walk in
the night, with confidence and security. But, when he began to make use of
his new sense, he seemed transported beyond measure. He said that
every new object was a new source of delight, and that his pleasure was
so great as to be past expression. About a year after, he was brought
to Epsom, where there is a very fine prospect, with which he seemed
greatly charmed; and he called the landscape before him a new method of
seeing. He was couched <PB N="156" REF="160"/> in the other eye, a year after
the former, and the operation succeeded equally well: when he saw with both
eyes, he said that objects appeared to him twice as large as when he saw
but with one; however, he did not see them doubled, or at least he shewed
no marks as if he saw them so. Mr. Cheselden mentions instances of many
more that were restored to sight in this manner; they all seemed to
concur in their perceptions with this youth; and they all seemed particularly
embarrassed in learning how to direct their eyes to the objects they
wished to observe.</P>
<P>In this manner it is that our feeling corrects the sense of
seeing, and that objects which ap∣pear of very different sizes, at
different di∣stances, are all reduced, by experience, to their natural
standard. 
<Q REND="inline">"But not the feeling only, but also the colour,
and brightness of the ob∣ject, contributes, in some measure, to
assist us in forming an idea of the distance at which it appears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon gives a different theory, for which I must refer the
reader to the original. That I have given, I take to be easy, and
satisfactory enough.</NOTE>. Those which we see most strongly marked
with light and shade, we readily know to be nearer than those on which the
colours are more faintly spread, and that, in some mea∣sure, take a part
of their hue from the air <PB N="157" REF="161"/> between us and them. Bright
objects also, are seen at a greater distance than such as are
ob∣scure, and, most probably, for this reason, that, being less
similar in colour to the air which interposes, their impressions are
less effaced by it, and they continue more distinctly visible. Thus a
black and distant object is not seen so far off as a bright and
glittering one; and a fire by night is seen much farther off than by
day."</Q></P>
<P>The power of seeing objects at a distance is very rarely equal
in both eyes. When this inequality is in any great degree, the person so
circumstanced then makes use only of one eye, shutting that which sees
the least, and employ∣ing the other with all its power. And hence proceeds
that aukward look which is known by the name of strabism.</P>
<P>There are many reasons to induce us to think that such as are
near sighted see objects larger than other persons; and yet the contrary
is most certainly true, for they see them less. Mr. Buffon informs us
that he himself is short sighted, and that his left eye is stronger
than his right. He has very frequently experienced, upon looking at any object,
such as the letters of a book, that they appear less to the weakest eye;
and that when he places the book, so as that the letters appear double, the
images of <PB N="158" REF="162"/> the left eye, which is strongest, are
greater than those of the right, which is the most feeble. He has examined
several others, who were in similar circumstances, and has always found
that the best eye saw every object the largest. This he ascribes to
habit; for near sighted people being accustomed to come close to the
object, and view but a small part of it at a time, the habit ensues, when
the whole of an object is seen, and it appears less to them than to
others.</P>
<P>Infants having their eyes less than those of adults, must
see objects also smaller in propor∣tion. For the image formed on the back
of the eye will be large, as the eye is capacious; and infants, having it not
so great, cannot have so large a picture of the object. This may be a
reason also why they are unable to see so di∣stinctly, or at such
distances as persons arrived at maturity.</P>
<P>Old men, on the contrary, see bodies close to them very
indistinctly, but bodies at a great di∣stance from them with more
precision; and this may happen from an alteration in the coats, or, perhaps,
humours of the eye; and not, as is supposed, from their dimunition. The
cornea, for instance, may become too rigid to adapt itself, and take a
proper convexity for seeing <PB N="159" REF="163"/> minute objects; and its
very flatness will be suf∣ficient to fit it for distant vision.</P>
<P>When we cast our eyes upon an object ex∣tremely brilliant, or when
we fix and detain them too long upon the same object, the organ is hurt and
fatigued, its vision becomes indistinct, and the image of the body, which
has thus too violently, or too perseveringly employed us, is painted upon
every thing we look at, and mixes with every object that occurs. 
<Q REND="inline">"And this is an obvious consequence of the eye
taking in too much light, either immediately, or by reflexion. Every body
whatsoever that is ex∣posed to the light, for a time, drinks in a quan∣tity
of its rays, which, being brought into dark∣ness, it cannot instantly
discharge. Thus the hand, if it be exposed to broad day light, for some
time, and then immediately snatched into a dark room, will appear still
luminous; and it will be some time before it is totally dark∣ened. It is thus
with the eye; which, either by an instant gaze at the sun, or a steady
con∣tinuance, upon some less brilliant object, has taken in too much light;
its humours are, for a while, unfit for vision, until that be discharged,
and room made for rays of a milder nature."</Q> How dangerous the looking upon
bright and luminous objects is to the sight, may be easily 
<PB N="160" REF="164"/> seen, from such as live in countries, covered for
most part of the year with snow, who become generally blind before their
time. Travellers themselves, who cross these countries, are obliged to
wear a crape before their eyes, to save their eyes, which would otherwise
be ren∣dered totally unserviceable; and it is equally dangerous in the
sandy plains of Africa. The reflexion of the light is there so strong
that it is impossible to sustain the effect, with∣out incurring the
danger of losing one's sight entirely. Such persons, therefore, as read,
or write for any continuance, should chuse a mo∣derate light, in order to
save their eyes; and, although it may seem insufficient at first, the
eye will accustom itself to the shade, by de∣grees, and be less hurt by
the want of light than the excess.</P>
<P>"It is, indeed, surprizing how far the eye can accommodate
itself to darkness, and make the best of a gloomy situation. When
first taken from the light, and brought into a dark room, all things
disappear; or, if any thing is seen, it is only the remaining radiations
that still continue in the eye. But, after a very little time, when these
are spent, the eye takes the advantage of the smallest ray that happens
to enter; and this alone would, in time, serve for many of the purposes of
life. There was a <PB N="161" REF="165"/> gentleman of great courage and
understanding, as we are told, by Boyle, who wasa major under King Charles
the First. This unfortunate man sharing in his master's misfortunes, and
being forced abroad, ventured at Madrid to do his king a signal service;
but, unluckily, failed in the at∣tempt. In consequence of this, he was
instantly ordered to a dark and dismal dungeon, into which the light never
entered, and into which there was no opening but by an hole at the top; down
which the keeper put his provisions, and presently closed it again on the
other side. In this manner the unfortunate loyalist conti∣nued for some
weeks, distressed and disconsolate; but, at last, began to think he
saw some little glimmering of light. This internal dawn seemed to
encrease from time to time, so that he could not only discover the parts
of his bed, and such other large objects, but, at length, he even be∣gan to
perceive the mice that frequented his cell; and saw them as they ran about
the floor, eating the crumbs of bread that happened to fall. After some
months confinement he was at last set free; but, such was the effect of
the darkness upon him, that he could not for some days venture to leave his
dungeon, but was obliged to accustom himself by degrees to the light of the
day.</P>

<PB N="162" REF="166"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Hearing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapter is
taken from Mr. Buffon, except where marked by inverted commas.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>AS the sense of hearing, as well as of sight, gives us notice
of remote objects, so, like that, it is subject to similar errors, being
capable of imposing on us upon all occasions, where we cannot rectify it by
the sense of feeling. We can have from it no distinct intelligence of the
distance from whence a sounding body is heard; a great noise far off, and
a small one very near, produce the same sensation; and, unless we
re∣ceive information from some other sense, we can never distinctly
tell whether the sound be a great or a small one. It is not till we have
learned, by experience, that the particular sound which is heard, is of a
peculiar kind; then we can judge of the distance from whence we hear it. When
we know the tone of the bell, we can then judge how far it is from us.</P>
<P>Every body that strikes against another pro∣duces a sound,
which is simple, and but one in bodies which are not elastic, but which is
often repeated in such as are. If we strike a bell, or 
<PB N="163" REF="167"/> a stretched string, for instance, which are both
elastic, a single blow produces a sound, which is repeated by the
undulations of the sonorous body, and which is multiplied as often as it
happens to undulate, or vibrate. These undu∣lations each strike their own
peculiar blow; but they succeed so fast, one behind the other, that the
ear supposes them one continued sound; whereas, in reality, they make
many. A per∣son who should, for the first time, hear the toll of the
bell, would, very probably, be able to distinguish these breaks of
sound; and, in fact, we can readily ourselves perceive an intension and
remission in the sound.</P>
<P>In this manner, sounding bodies are of two kinds; those
unelastic ones, which being struck, return but a single sound; and
those more elastic returning a succession of sounds; which uniting
together form a tone. This tone may be con∣sidered as a great number of
sounds, all pro∣duced one after the other, by the same body, as we find in
a bell, or the string of an harp∣sichord, which continues to sound for
some time after it is struck. A continuing tone may be also produced from
a nonelastic body, by repeating the blow quick and often, as when we beat a
drum, or when we draw a bow along the string of a fiddle.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="168"/>Considering the subject in this light, if
we should multiply the number of blows, or repeat them at quicker intervals
upon the sounding body, as upon the drum, for instance, it is evi∣dent that
this will have no effect in altering the tone; it will only make it either more
even or more distinct. But it is otherwise, if we en∣crease the force of
the blow; if we strike the body with double weight, this will produce a tone
twice as loud as the former. If, for in∣stance, I strike a table with a
switch, this will be very different from the sound produced by striking
it with a cudgel. From hence, there∣fore, we may infer, that all bodies give a
louder and graver tone, not in proportion to the num∣ber of times they are
struck, but in proportion to the force that strikes them. And, if this be
so, those philosophers who make the tone of a sonorous body, of a bell,
or the string of an harpsichord, for instance, to depend upon the number
only of its vibrations, and not the force, have mistaken what is only an
effect for a cause. A bell, or an elastic string, can only be
considered as a drum beaten; and the fre∣quency of the blows can make no
alteration whatsoever in the tone. The largest bells, and the longest and
thickest strings, have the most forceful vibrations; and, therefore,
their tones are the most loud and the most grave.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="169"/>To know the manner in which sounds thus
produced become pleasing, it must be observed, no one continuing tone,
how loud or swelling soever, can give us satisfaction; we must have a
succession of them, and those in the most pleasing proportion. The
nature of this pro∣portion may be thus conceived. If we strike a body
incapable of vibration with a double force, or, what amounts to the same
thing, with a double mass of matter, it will produce a sound that will be
doubly grave. Music has been said, by the ancients, to have been first
invented from the blows of different hammers on an an∣vil. Suppose then we
strike an anvil with an hammer of one pound weight, and again with an hammer
of two pounds, it is plain that the two pound hammer will produce a sound
twice as grave as the former. But if we strike with a two pound hammer, and
then with a three pound, it is evident that the latter will pro∣duce a sound
one third more grave than the former. If we strike the anvil with a three
pound hammer, and then with a four pound, it will likewise follow that the
latter will be a quarter part more grave than the former. Now, in the comparing
between all those sounds, it is obvious that the difference between one and
two is more easily perceived than between two <PB N="166" REF="170"/> and
three, three and four, or any numbers suc∣ceeding in the same proportion.
The succession of sounds will be, therefore, pleasing in pro∣portion
to the ease with which they may be di∣stinguished. That sound which is
double the former, or, in other words, the octave to the preceding tone, will
of all others be the most pleasing harmony. The next to that, which is as
two to three, or, in other words, the third, will be most agreeable. And thus
universally, those sounds whose differences may be most easily
compared are the most agreeable.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Musicians, therefore, have contented
them∣selves with seven different proportions of sound, which are called
notes, and which sufficiently answer all the purposes of pleasure. Not
but that they might adopt a greater diversity of proportions; and some have
actually done so; but, in these, the differences of the proportion are so
imperceptible, that the ear is rather fa∣tigued than pleased in making the
distinction. In order, however, to give variety, they have admitted half
tones; but, in all the countries where music is yet in its infancy, they have
re∣jected such; and they can find music in none but the obvious ones. The
Chinese, for in∣stance, have neither flats nor sharps in their music;
but the intervals between their other notes, are in the same proportion with
ours. 
<P><PB N="167" REF="171"/>"Many more barbarous nations have their
peculiar instruments of music; and, what is re∣markable, the proportion
between their notes is in all the same as in ours. This is not the place for
entering into the nature of these sounds, their effects upon the air, or
their consonances with each other. We are not now giving an history of
sound, but of human perception.</P> 
<P>"All countries are pleased with music; and, if they have not
skill enough to produce har∣mony, at least they seem willing to
substitute noise. Without all question, noise alone is sufficient
to operate powerfully on the spirits; and, if the mind be already
predisposed to joy, I have seldom found noise fail of encreasing it
into rapture. The mind feels a kind of distracted pleasure in such
powerful sounds, braces up every nerve, and riots in the excess. But, as in
the eye, an immediate gaze upon the sun will disturb the organ, so, in
the ear, a loud, unex∣pected noise, disorders the whole frame, and
sometimes disturbs the sense ever after. The mind must have time to
prepare for the expected shock, and to give its organs the proper tension
for its arrival."</P> 
<P>"Musical sounds, however, seem of a dif∣ferent kind. These
are generally most pleasing, which are most unexpected. It is not from
bracing <PB N="168" REF="172"/> up the nerves, but from the grateful
succession of the sounds, that these become so charming. There are
few, how indifferent soever, but have at times felt their pleasing
impression; and, perhaps, even those who have stood out against the
powerful persuasion of sounds, only wanted the proper tune, or the proper
instrument, to allure them."</P> 
<P>"The ancients give us a thousand strange in∣stances of the
effects of music, upon men and animals. The story of Arion's harp, that
ga∣thered the dolphins to the ship side, is well known; and, what is
remarkable, Schotteus assures us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Quod occulis meis spectavi. 
<BIBL>Schotti Magic. uni∣versalis, pars ii. l. 1, p.
26.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, that he saw a similar instance of fishes being
allured by music, himself. They tell us of diseases that have been
cured, un∣chastity corrected, seditions quelled, passions removed, and
sometimes excited even to mad∣ness. Doctor Wallis has endeavoured to
ac∣count for these surprizing effects, by ascribing them to the novelty
of the art. For my own part, I can scarce hesitate to impute them to the
exaggeration of their writers. They are as hy∣perbolical in the effects of
their oratory; and yet, we well know, there is nothing in the orations which
they have left us, capable of ex∣citing <PB N="169" REF="173"/> madness, or of
raising the mind to that ungovernable degree of fury which they de∣scribe.
As they have exaggerated, therefore, in one instance, we may naturally
suppose, that they have done the same in the other: and, in∣deed, from
the few remains we have of their music, collected by Meibomius, one might be
apt to suppose, there was nothing very powerful in what is lost. Nor does
any one of the ancient instruments, such as we see them represented in
statues, appear comparable to our fiddle."</P> 
<P>"However this be, we have many odd ac∣counts, not only among them,
but the moderns, of the power of music; and it must not be de∣nied, but
that, on some particular occasions, musical sounds may have a very
powerful effect. I have seen all the horses and cows in a field, where
there were above an hundred, gather round a person that was blowing the
French horn, and seeming to testify an aukward kind of satisfaction. Dogs
are well known to be very sensible of different tones in music; and I
have sometimes heard them sustain a very ridiculous part in a concert,
where their assist∣ance was neither expected nor desired."</P> 
<P>"We are told<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Olaij Magni, l. 15,
hist. c. 28.</BIBL></NOTE>, of Henry IV. of Denmark, that being one day
desirous of trying in person <PB N="170" REF="174"/> whether a musician
who boasted that he could excite men to madness, was not an impostor, he
submitted to the operation of his skill: but the consequence was much
more terrible than he expected; for, becoming actually mad, he killed four of
his attendants, in the midst of his transports. A contrary effect of
music we have<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hist. de l'Accad. 1708, p.
22.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the cure of a madman, of Alais, in France, by music.
This man, who was a dancing-master, after a fever of five days, grew furious,
and so ungovernable that his hands were obliged to be tied to his sides:
what at first was rage, in a short time was converted into silent
melancholy, which no arts could ex∣hilerate, nor no medicines remove. In this
sullen and dejected state, an old acquaintance accidentally came to enquire
after his health; he found him sitting up in bed, tied, and to∣tally
regardless of every external object round him. Happening, however, to take up
a fiddle that lay in the room, and touching a favourite air, the poor madman
instantly seemed to brighten up at the sound; from a recumbent posture,
he began to sit up; and as the musician continued playing, the patient
seemed desirous of dancing to the sound: but he was tied, and incapable
of leaving his bed, so that he could <PB N="171" REF="175"/> only humour the
tune with his head, and that part of his arms which were at liberty. Thus the
other continued playing, and the dancing-master practiced his own art, as far
as he was able, for about a quarter of an hour, when sud∣denly falling into a
deep sleep, in which his dis∣order came to a crisis, he awaked perfectly
re∣covered."</P> 
<P>"A thousand other instances might be added, equally true: let it
suffice to add one more, which is not true; I mean that of the taran∣tula.
Every person who has been in Italy, now well knows, that the bite of this
animal, and its being cured by music, is all a deception. When strangers
come into that part of the country, the country people are ready enough to take
money for dancing to the tarantula. A friend of mine had a servant who
suffered himself to be bit; the wound, which was little larger than the
puncture of a pin, was uneasy for a few hours, and then became well without
any far∣ther assistance. Some of the country people, however, still
make a tolerable livelihood of the credulity of strangers, as the musician
finds his account in it not less than the dancer."</P></Q></P>
<P> Sounds, like light, are not only extensively diffused, but are
frequently reflected. The laws of this reflection, it is true, are not as well 
<PB N="172" REF="176"/> understood as those of light; all we know is, that
sound is principally reflected by hard bo∣dies; and their being hollow
also, sometimes encreases the reverberation. 
<Q REND="inline">"No art, how∣ever, can make an echo; and some, who
have bestowed great labour and expence upon such a project, have only
erected shapeless buildings, whose silence was a mortifying lecture
upon their presumption."</Q></P>
<P> The internal cavity of the ear seems to be fitted up for the
purposes of ecchoing sound with the greatest precision. This part is
fashioned out in the temporal bone, like a cavern cut into a rock. 
<Q REND="inline">"In this the sound is repeated and articulated;
and, as some anatomists tell us, (for we have as yet but very little
knowledge on this subject) is beaten against the tympanum, or drum of the
ear, which moves four little bones joined thereto; and these move and
agi∣tate the internal air which lies on the other side; and, lastly, this
air strikes and affects the au∣ditory nerves, which carry the sound to the
brain."</Q></P>
<P> One of the most common disorders in old age is deafness;
which probably proceeds from the rigidity of the nerves in the labyrinth of the
ear. This disorder also, sometimes pro∣ceeds from a stoppage of the
wax, which art <PB N="173" REF="177"/> may easily remedy. In order to know
whether the defect be an internal or an external one, let the deaf person put
a repeating watch into his mouth; and if he hears it strike, he may be
assured that his disorder proceeds from an external cause, and is, in
some measure, curable: 
<Q REND="inline">"for there is a passage from the ears into the
mouth, by what anatomists call the eustachian tube; and, by this
passage, people often hear sounds, when they are utterly with∣out hearing
through the larger channel: and this also is the reason that we often see
persons who listen with great attention, hearken with their mouths open, in
order to catch all the sound at every apperture."</Q></P>
<P>It often happens, that persons hear differently with one ear from
the other; and it is generally found that these have what is called, by
mu∣sicians, a bad ear. Mr. Buffon, who has made many trials upon persons,
of this kind, always found that their defect in judging properly of sounds,
proceeded from the inequality of their ears; and receiving by both, at the
same time, unequal sensations, they form an unjust idea. In this
manner, as those people hear false, they also, without knowing it, sing
false. Those persons also frequently deceive themselves with regard
to the side from whence the sound <PB N="174" REF="178"/> comes, generally
supposing the noise to come on the part of the best ear.</P>
<P>Such as are hard of hearing, find the same advantage in the
trumpet made for this pur∣pose, that short-sighted persons do from
glasses. These trumpets might be easily enlarged, so as to encrease
sounds, in the same manner that the telescope does bodies: however, they
could be used to advantage only in a place of solitude and stillness,
as the neighbouring sounds would mix with the more distant, and the whole
would produce in the ear nothing but tumult and con∣fusion.</P>
<P>Hearing is a much more necessary sense to man than to
animals. With these it is only a warning against danger, or an
encouragement to mutual assistance. In man, it is the source of most
of his pleasures; and without which, the rest of his senses would be of
little benefit. A man born deaf, must necessarily be dumb; and his whole
sphere of knowledge must be bounded only by sensual objects. We have an
instance of a young man who, being born deaf, was restored, at the age of
twenty-four, to per∣fect hearing: the account is given in the Me∣moirs of the
Academy of Sciences, 1703, page 18.</P>
<P>A young man, of the town of Chartres, <PB N="175" REF="179"/> between
the age of twenty-three and twenty-four, the son of a tradesman, and deaf
and dumb from his birth, began to speak all of a sudden, to the great
astonishment of the whole town. He gave them to understand that, about
three or four months before, he had heard the sound of the bells for the
first time, and was greatly surprized at this new and unknown
sen∣sation. After some time, a kind of water issued from his left
ear, and he then heard per∣fectly well with both. During these three months,
he was sedulously employed in listen∣ing without saying a word, and
accustoming himself to speak softly, so as not to be heard, the words
pronounced by others. He la∣boured hard also in perfecting himself in the
pronunciation, and in the ideas attached to every sound. At length, having
supposed him∣self qualified to break silence, he declared, that he
could now speak, although as yet but im∣perfectly. Soon after, some able
divines questioned him concerning his ideas of his past state; and
principally with respect to God, his soul, the morality or turpitude of
actions. The young man, however, had not driven his solitary speculations
into that channel. He had gone to mass indeed with his parents, had learned
to sign himself with the cross, to kneel down and <PB N="176" REF="180"/>
assume all the grimaces of a man that was pray∣ing; but he did all this
without any manner of knowledge of the intention or the cause; he saw
others do the like, and that was enough for him; he knew nothing even of death,
and it never entered into his head; he led a life of pure ani∣mal instinct;
entirely taken up with sensible objects, and such as were present, he
did not seem even to make as many reflections upon these, as might
reasonably be expected from his improving situation: and yet, the young man
was not in want of understanding; but the understanding of a man, deprived
of all com∣merce with others, is so very confined, that the mind is in some
measure totally under the con∣trol of its immediate sensations.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, it is very possible to com∣municate ideas to
deaf men, which they pre∣viously wanted, and even give them very pre∣cise
notions of some abstract subjects, by means of signs, and of letters. A
person born deaf, may, by time, and sufficient pains, be taught to write
and read, to speak, and, by the motions of the lips, to understand what is
said to him: however, it is probable that, as most of the motions of
speech are made within the mouth by the tongue, the knowledge from the motion
of the lips, is but very confined: 
<Q REND="inline">"nevertheless, <PB N="177" REF="181"/> I have
conversed with a gentleman thus taught, and in all the commonly occurring
questions, and the usual salutations, he was ready enough, merely by
attending to the motion of the lips alone. When I ventured to speak for a
short continuance, he was totally at a loss, although he understood the
subject, when written, ex∣tremely well."</Q> Persons taught in this manner,
were at first considered as prodigies; but there have been so many
instances of success of late, and so many are skilful in the art of
instructing in this way, that, though still a matter of some curiosity,
it ceases to be an object of wonder.</P>

<PB N="178" REF="182"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of smelling, feeling, and tasting.</HEAD>
<P>AN animal may be said to fill up that sphere which he can reach
by his senses; and is actually large in proportion to the sphere to which
its organ extends. By sight, man's enjoyments are diffused into a wide
circle; that of hearing, tho' less widely diffused, nevertheless extends
his powers; the sense of smelling is more contracted still; and the
taste and touch are the most confined of all. Thus man enjoys very
distant objects, but with one sense only; more nearly he brings two
senses at once to bear upon them; his sense of smelling assists
the other two, at its own distance; and of such objects, as a man, he may
be said to be in perfect possession.</P>
<P>Each sense, however, the more it acts at a di∣stance, the more
capable it is of making combi∣nations; and is, consequently, the more
improve∣able. Refined imaginations, and men of strong minds, take more
pleasure, therefore, in improv∣ing the delights of the distant senses,
than in enjoying such as are scarce capable of improve∣ment.</P>
<P>By combining the objects of the extensive <PB N="179" REF="183"/>
senses, all the arts of poetry, painting, and har∣mony, have been
discovered; but the closer senses, if I may so call them, such as
smelling, tasting, and touching, are, in some measure, as simple as
they are limited, and admit of little variety. The man of imagination makes a
great and an artificial happiness, by the pleasure of altering and
combining; the sensualist just stops where he began, and cultivates
only those plea∣sures which he cannot improve. The sensualist is
contented with those enjoyments that are already made to his hand; but the
man of pleasure is best pleased with growing happiness.</P>
<P>Of all the senses, perhaps, there is not one in which man is
more inferior to other animals than in that of smelling. With man, it is a
sense that acts in a narrow sphere, and disgusts almost as
frequently as it gives him pleasure. With many other animals it is diffused
to a very great extent; and never seems to offend them. Dogs not only trace
the steps of other animals, but also discover them by the scent, at a
very great distance; and, while they are thus exquisitely sensible of
all smells, they seem no way dis∣gusted by any.</P>
<P>But, although this sense is, in general, so very inferior in
man, it is much stronger in those nations that abstain from animal 
<PB N="180" REF="184"/> food, than among us of Europe. The Bra∣mins of India
have a power of smelling, as I am informed, equal to what it is in most
other creatures. They can smell the water which they drink, that to us
seems quite inodorous; and have a word, in their language, which denotes a
country of fine water. We are told, also, that the Negroes of the Antilles,
by the smell alone, can distinguish between the footsteps of a
Frenchman and a Negro. It is possible, there∣fore, that we may dull this
organ by our lux∣urious way of living; and sacrifice to the plea∣sures of
taste those which might be received from perfume.</P>
<P>However, it is a sense that we can, in some measure,
dispense with; and I have known many that wanted it entirely, with but very
little inconvenience from its loss. In a state of nature it is said to be
useful to us, in guiding us to proper nourishment, and deterring us from
that which is unwholesome; but, in our present situation, such
information is but little wanted; and, indeed, but little attended to. In fact,
the sense of smelling gives us very often false in∣telligence. Many
things that have a disagree∣able odour are, nevertheless, wholesome, and
pleasant to the taste; and such as make eating an art, seldom think a
meal fit to please the ap∣petite <PB N="181" REF="185"/> till it begins to
offend the nose. On the other hand, there are many things that smell most
gratefully, and yet are noxious, or fatal to the constitution. Some
physicians think that all perfumes, in general, are unwholesome; that they
relax the nerves, produce head aches, and even retard digestion. The machinel
apple, which is known to be deadly poison, is possessed of the most
grateful odour. Some of those mineral vapours that are often found fatal, in
the stomach, smell like the sweetest flowers, and continue thus to
flatter till they destroy. This sense, therefore, as it should seem,
was never meant to direct us in the choice of food, but appears rather as an
attendant than a necessary pleasure.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we examine the natives of different countries, or even
different natives of the same, we shall find no pleasure in which they
differ so widely as that of smelling. Some persons are pleased with the
smell of a rose; while I have known others that could not abide to have it
approach them. The savage nations are highly delighted with the smell of
assafoetida, which is to us the most nauseous stink in nature. It
would in a manner seem that our delight in per∣fumes was made by habit; and
that a very little <PB N="182" REF="186"/> industry could bring us totally to
invert the perception of odours.</P>
<P>Thus much is certain, that many bodies which at one distance are
an agreeable perfume, when nearer are a most ungrateful odour. Musk, and
ambergrease, in small quantities, are considered by most persons as
highly fragrant; and yet, when in larger masses, their scent is
insufferable. From a mixture of two bodies, each whereof is, of itself,
void of all smell, a very powerful smell may be drawn. Thus, by grinding
quick lime with sal-ammoniac, may be produced a very foetid mixture. On the
contrary, from a mixture of two bodies, that are separately dis∣agreeable,
a very pleasant aromatic odour may be gained. A mixture of aqua fortis with
spirit of wine produces this effect. But not only the alterations of bodies,
by each other, but the smallest change in us, makes a very great
alte∣ration in this sense, and frequently deprives us of it totally. A
slight cold often hinders us from smelling; and as often changes the nature
of odours. Some persons, from disorder, retain an incurable aversion to
those smells which most pleased them before; and many have been known
to have an antipathy to some animals, whose presence they instantly
perceive by the smell. From all this, therefore, the sense of 
<PB N="183" REF="187"/> smelling appears to be an uncertain monitor, easily
disordered, and not much missed when totally wanting.</P>
<P>The sense most nearly allied to smelling is that of
tasting. This, some have been willing to consider merely as a nicer kind
of touch, and have undertaken to account, in a very me∣chanical manner, for the
difference of savours. Such bodies, said they, as are pointed, happen∣ing
to be applied to the papillae of the tongue, excite a very powerful
sensation, and give us the idea of saltness. Such, on the contrary, as
are of a rounder figure, slide smoothly along the papillae, and are
perceived to be sweet. In this manner they have, with minute labour, gone
through the variety of imagined forms in bo∣dies, and have given them as
imaginary ef∣fects. All we can precisely determine upon the nature of
tastes is, that the bodies to be tasted must be either somewhat
moistened, or, in some measure, dissolved by the saliva before they
can produce a proper sensation: when both the tongue itself, and the body
to be tasted, are extremely dry, no taste whatever ensues. The
sensation is then changed; and the tongue, instead of tasting, can only
be said, like any other part of the body, to feel the object.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="188"/>It is for this reason, that children have a
stronger relish of tastes than those who are more advanced in life.
This organ with them, from the greater moisture of their bodies, is kept in
greater perfection; and is, consequently, better adapted to perform its
functions. Every person remembers how great a pleasure he found in
sweets, while a child; but his taste growing more obtuse, with age, he is
obliged to use ar∣tificial means to excite it. It is then that he is found to
call in the assistance of poignant sauces, and strong relishes, of
salts and aromatics; all which the delicacy of his tender organ, in
child∣hood, were unable to endure. His taste grows callous to the natural
relishes; and is artificially formed to others more unnatural; so that the
highest epicure may be said to have the most depraved taste; as it is
owing to the bluntness of his organs that he is obliged to have recourse to
such a variety of expedients, to gratify his appetite.</P>
<P>As smells are often rendered agreeable by habit, so also
tastes may be. Tobacco, and coffee, so pleasing to many, are yet, at
first, very disagreeable to all. It is not without per∣severance that we
begin to have a relish for them; we force nature so long, that what was
constraint, in the beginning, at last becomes inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="189"/>The grossest, and yet the most
useful of all the senses, is that of feeling. We are often seen to
survive under the loss of the rest; but of this we can never be totally
deprived, but with life. Although this sense is diffused over all parts
of the body, yet it most frequently happens that those parts which are
most exercised in touching, acquire the greatest degree of accuracy. Thus
the fingers, by long habit, become greater ma∣sters in the art than any
others, even where the sensation is more delicate and fine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. vi. p. 80.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is from this
habit, therefore, and their peculiar forma∣tion, and not, as is supposed,
from their being furnished with a greater quantity of nerves, that the
fingers are thus perfectly qualified to judge of forms. Blind men, who are
obliged to use them much oftener than we, have this sense much finer;
so that the delicacy of the touch arises rather from the habit of
constantly employing the fingers, than from any fancied nervousness in
their conformation.</P>
<P>All animals that are furnished with hands<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. vi. p. 82.</BIBL></NOTE>, seem to have more
understanding than others. Monkeys have so many actions, like those of
men, that they appear to have similar ideas of the form of bodies. All other
creatures, de∣prived of hands, can have no distinct ideas of 
<PB N="186" REF="190"/> the shape of the objects, by which they are
sur∣rounded, as they want this organ, which serves to examine and measure
their forms, their risings and depressions. A quadrupede probably
con∣ceives as erroneous an idea of any thing near him, as a child would of a
rock, or a mountain, that it beheld at a distance. It may be for this
reason, that we often see them frighted at things with which they ought to
be better acquainted. Fishes, whose bodies are covered with scales, and
who have no organs for feeling, must be the most stupid of all animals.
Serpents, that are likewise destitute, are yet, by winding round several
bodies, better capable of judging of their form. All these, however, can have
but very imperfect ideas from feeling; and we have already seen, when
deprived of this sense, how little the rest of the senses are to be
relied on.</P>
<P>The feeling, therefore, is the guardian, the judge, and the examiner
of all the rest of the senses. It establishes their information, and
detects their errors. All the other senses are altered by time, and
contradict their former evidence; but the touch still continues the same;
and though extremely confined in its operations, yet it is never found to
deceive. The universe, to a man who had only used the rest of his
senses, would be but a scene of il∣lusion; <PB N="187" REF="191"/> every
object misrepresented, and all its properties unknown. Mr. Buffon has
ima∣gined a man just newly brought into existence, describing the
illusion of his first sensations, and pointing out the steps by which
he arrived at reality. He considers him as just created, and awaking
amidst the productions of Nature; and, to animate the narrative still more
strongly, has made his philosophical man a speaker. The reader will no
doubt recollect Adam's speech in Milton, as being similar. All that I can
say to obviate the imputation of plagiarism is, that the one treats the
subject more as a poet, the other more as a philosopher. The
philosopher's man describes his first sensations in the following
manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. vi. p. 88.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I well remember that joyful anxious mo∣ment when I first became
acquainted with my own existence. I was quite ignorant of what I was, how I
was produced, or from whence I came. I opened my eyes: what an addition to my
surprize! the light of the day, the azure vault of heaven, the verdure of the
earth, the chrystal of the waters, all employed me at once, and animated and
filled me with inexpressible delight. I at first imagined that all
those ob∣jects <PB N="188" REF="192"/> were within me, and made a part of
myself.</P>
<P>Impressed with this idea, I turned my eyes to the sun; its
splendor dazzled and over∣powered me: I shut them once more; and, to my
great concern, I supposed that, during this short interval of darkness,
I was again returning to nothing.</P>
<P>Afflicted, seized with astonishment, I pon∣dered a moment on
this great change, when I heard a variety of unexpected sounds. The
whistling of the wind, and the melody of the grove, formed a concert, the
soft cadence of which sunk upon my soul. I listened for some time,
and was persuaded that all this music was within me.</P>
<P>Quite occupied with this new kind of ex∣istence, I had already
forgotten the light which was my first inlet into life; when I once more
opened my eyes, and found myself again in possession of my former
happiness. The gra∣tification of the two senses at once, was a
plea∣sure too great for utterance.</P>
<P>I turned my eyes upon a thousand various objects: I soon found
that I could lose them, and restore them at will; and amused myself
more at leisure with a repetition of this new-made power.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="193"/>I now began to gaze without emotion, and to
hearken with tranquillity, when a light breeze, the freshness of which
charmed me, wafted its perfumes to my sense of smelling, and gave me
such satisfaction as even encreased my self-love.</P>
<P>Agitated, rouzed by the various pleasures of my new existence, I
instantly arose, and per∣ceived myself moved along, as if by some
un∣known and secret power.</P>
<P>I had scarce proceeded forward, when the novelty of my situation
once more rendered me immoveable. My surprize returned; I sup∣posed that
every object around me had been in motion: I gave to them that agitation which
I produced by changing place; and the whole creation seemed once more in
disorder.</P>
<P>I lifted my hand to my head; I touched my forehead; I felt my whole
frame: I then sup∣posed that my hand was the principal organ of my
existence; all its informations were distinct and perfect; and so
superior to the senses I had yet experienced, that I employed myself
for some time in repeating its enjoyments: every part of my person I
touched, seemed to touch my hand in turn; and gave back sensation for
sensation.</P>
<P>I soon found, that this faculty was expanded over the whole
surface of my body; and I now <PB N="190" REF="194"/> first began to
perceive the limits of my exist∣ence, which I had in the beginning
supposed spread over all the objects I saw.</P>
<P>Upon casting my eyes upon my body, and surveying my own form, I
thought it greater than all the objects that surrounded me. I gazed upon my
person with pleasure; I exa∣mined the formation of my hand, and all its
motions; it seemed to me large or little in pro∣portion as I approached it to
my eyes; I brought it very near, and it then hid almost every other object
from my sight. I began soon, however, to find that my sight gave me
uncertain infor∣mation, and resolved to depend upon my feel∣ing for
redress.</P>
<P>This precaution was of the utmost service; I renewed my motions,
and walked forward with my face turned towards the heavens. I happened to
strike lightly against a palm-tree, and this renewed my surprize: I laid
my hand on this strange body; it seemed replete with new wonders, for it
did not return me sensation for sensation, as my former feelings had
done. I now, therefore, perceived that there was some∣thing external, and
which did not make a part of my own existence.</P>
<P>I now, therefore, resolved to touch whatever I saw, and vainly
attempted to touch the sun; <PB N="191" REF="195"/> I stretched forth my
arm, and felt only yielding air: at every effort, I fell from one surprize
into another, for every object appeared equally near me; and it was not till
after an infinity of trials, that I found some objects further re∣moved than
the rest.</P>
<P>Amazed with the illusions, and the uncer∣tainty of my state, I
sat down beneath a tree; the most beautiful fruits hung upon it, within my
reach; I stretched forth my hand, and they instantly separated from the
branch. I was proud of being able to grasp a substance with∣out me; I
held them up, and their weight ap∣peared to me like an animated power that
en∣deavoured to draw them to the earth. I found a pleasure in conquering
their resistance.</P>
<P>I held them near my eye; I considered their form and beauty; their
fragrance still more al∣lured me to bring them nearer; I approached them to
my lips, and drank in their odours; the perfume invited my sense of
tasting, and I soon tried a new sense—How new! how ex∣quisite!
Hitherto I had tasted only of pleasure; but now it was luxury. The power of
tasting gave me the idea of possession.</P>
<P>Flattered with this new acquisition, I con∣tinued its exercise,
till an agreeable languor stealing upon my mind, I felt all my limbs 
<PB N="192" REF="196"/> become heavy, and all my desires suspended. My
sensations were now no longer vivid and di∣stinct; but seemed to lose
every object, and pre∣sented only feeble images, confusedly marked. At that
instant I sunk upon the flowery bank, and slumber seized me. All now
seemed once more lost to me. It was then as if I was re∣turning into my
former nothing. How long my sleep continued, I cannot tell; as I yet had no
perception of time. My awaking appeared like a second birth; and I then
perceived that I had ceased for a time to exist. This produced a new
sensation of fear; and from this inter∣ruption in life, I began to conclude
that I was not formed to exist for ever.</P>
<P>In this state of doubt and perplexity, I began to harbour new
suspicions; and to fear that sleep had robbed me of some of my late
powers; when, turning on one side, to resolve my doubts, what was my
amazement, to behold another being, like myself, stretched by my side!
New ideas now began to arise; new passions, as yet unperceived, with
fears, and pleasures, all took possession of my mind, and prompted my
curiosity: love served to com∣plete that happiness which was begun in the
in∣dividual; and every sense was gratified in all its varieties.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of old Age and Death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This
chapter is taken from Mr. Buffon, except where it is marked by inverted
commas.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing in nature has its improvement and decay. The human form
is no sooner ar∣rived at its state of perfection than it begins to decline.
The alteration is, at first, insensible; and, often, several years are
elapsed before we find ourselves grown old. The news of this
dis∣agreeable change, too generally, comes from without; and we learn from
others that we grow old, before we are willing to believe the report.</P>
<P>When the body has come to its full height, and is extended into its
just dimensions; it then also begins to receive an additional bulk, which
rather loads than assists it. This is formed from fat; which generally,
at the age of thirty-five, or forty, covers all the muscles, and inter∣rupts
their activity. Every action is then per∣formed with greater labour, and the
encrease of size only serves as a forerunner of decay.</P>
<P>The bones, also, become every day more so∣lid. In the embryo
they are as soft almost as the muscles and the flesh; but, by de∣grees,
<PB N="194" REF="198"/> they harden, and acquire their natural vigour; but
still, however, the circulation is carried on through them; and, how hard
soever the bones may seem, yet the blood holds its current through them as
through all other parts of the body. Of this we may be convinced, by an
experiment, which was first accidentally dis∣covered, by our ingenious
countryman Mr. Belcher. Perceiving, at a friend's house, that the bones of
hogs, which were fed upon madder, were red, he tried it upon various animals,
by mixing this root with their usual food; and he found that it tinctured the
bones in all: an evident demonstration that the juices of the body had a
circulation through the bones. He fed some animals alternately upon madder
and their common food, for some time, and he found their bones tinctured with
alternate layers, in conformity to their manner of living. From all this, he
naturally concluded, that the blood circulated through the bones as it does
through every other part of the body; and that, how solid soever they
seemed, yet, like the softest parts, they were furnished, through all
their substance, with their proper canals. Never∣theless, these canals
are of very different ca∣pacities, during the different stages of life. In
infancy they are capacious; and the blood flows <PB N="195" REF="199"/> almost
as freely through the bones as through any other part of the body; in manhood
their size is greatly diminished; the vessels are al∣most
imperceptible; and the circulation through them is proportionably slow. But,
in the de∣cline of life, the blood, which flows through the bones, no longer
contributing to their growth, must necessarily serve to encrease
their hardness. The channels, that every where run through the human frame,
may be compared to those pipes that we every where see crusted on the
inside, by the water, for a long continuance, running through them. Both,
every day grow less and less, by the small rigid particles which are
de∣posited within them. Thus as the vessels are by degrees diminished,
the juices, also, which were necessary for the circulation through them,
are diminished in proportion; till, at length, in old age, those props of
the human frame are not only more solid but more brittle.</P>
<P>The cartilages, or gristles, which may be considered as bones
beginning to be formed, grow also more rigid. The juices circulating through
them, for there is a circulation through all parts of the body, every day
contributes to render them harder; so that these substances, which in
youth are elastic, and pliant in age, become hard and bony. As these
cartilages <PB N="196" REF="200"/> are generally placed near the joints, the
motion of the joints also, must, of consequence, become more difficult.
Thus, in old age, every ac∣tion of the body is performed with labour; and the
cartilages, formerly so supple, will now sooner break than bend.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"As the cartilages acquire hardness, and unfit the
joints for motion, so also that mucous li∣quor, which is always separated
between the joints, and which serves, like oil to an hinge, to give them an
easy and ready play, is now grown more scanty. It becomes thicker, and more
clammy, more unfit for answering the purposes of motion; and from thence,
in old age, every joint is not only stiff, but aukward. At every motion, this
clammy liquor is heard to crack; and it is not without the greatest ef∣fort
of the muscles that its resistance is over∣come. I have seen an old
person, that never moved a single joint that did not thus give no∣tice of
the violence that was done it."</Q></P>
<P>The membranes that cover the bones, the joints, and the rest of
the body, become, as we grow old, more dense and more dry. These which
surround the bones, soon cease to be duc∣tile. The fibres, of which the
muscles or flesh is composed, become every day more rigid; and, while to
the touch the body seems, as we ad∣vance <PB N="197" REF="201"/> in years, to
grow softer, it is, in reality, encreasing in hardness. It is the skin,
and not the flesh, that we feel upon such occasions. The fat, and the
flabbiness of that, seems to give an ap∣pearance of softness, which the
flesh itself is very far from having. There are few can doubt this after
trying the difference between the flesh of young and old animals. The first
is soft and tender, the last is hard and dry.</P>
<P>The skin is the only part of the body that age does not contribute
to harden. That stretches to every degree of tension; and we have horrid
instances of its pliancy, in many disorders incident to humanity. In youth,
therefore, while the body is vigorous and en∣creasing, it still gives way
to its growth. But, although it thus adapts itself to our encrease, it does
not in the same manner conform to our de∣cay. The skin, which in youth was
filled, and glossy, when the body begins to decline, has not elasticity
enough to shrink entirely with its di∣munition. It hangs, therefore, in
wrinkles, which no art can remove. The wrinkles of the body, in general,
proceed from this cause. But those of the face seem to proceed from
another; namely, from the many varieties of positions into which it is put by
the speech, the food, or the passions. Every grimace, and every 
<PB N="198" REF="202"/> passion wrinkles up the visage into different
forms. These are visible enough in young per∣sons; but what at first
was accidental, or transi∣tory, becomes unalterably fixed in the visage as
it grows older. 
<Q REND="inline">"From hence we may conclude, that a freedom from
passions not only adds to the happiness of the mind, but preserves the
beauty of the face; and the person that has not felt their influence, is
less strongly marked by the decays of nature."</Q></P>
<P>Hence, therefore, as we advance in age, the bones, the cartilages,
the membranes, the flesh, the skin, and every fibre of the body, becomes
more solid, more brittle, and more dry. Every part shrinks, every motion
becomes more slow; the circulation of the fluids is performed with less
freedom; perspiration diminishes; the se∣cretions alter; the digestion
becomes slow and laborious; and the juices no longer serving to convey
their accustomed nourishment, those parts may be said to live no longer
when the circulation ceases. Thus the body dies by little and little; all its
functions are diminished by degrees; life is driven from one part of the
frame to another; universal rigidity prevails; and death at last seizes
upon the little that is left.</P>
<P>As the bones, the cartilages, the muscles, <PB N="199" REF="203"/>
and all other parts of the body, are softer in women than in men, these
parts must, of con∣sequence require a longer time to come to that
hardness which hastens death. Women, there∣fore, ought to be a longer time
in growing old than men; and this is actually the case. If we consult the
tables which have been drawn up respecting human life, we shall find, that
after a certain age they are more long lived than men, all other
circumstances the same. A woman of sixty has a better chance than a man
of the same age to live till eighty. Upon the whole we may infer, that such
per∣sons as have been slow in coming up to ma∣turity, will also be slow
in growing old; and this holds as well with regard to other animals as to
man.</P>
<P>The whole duration of the life of either ve∣getables, or animals,
may be, in some measure, determined from their manner of coming to
maturity. The tree, or the animal, which takes but a short time to encrease
to its utmost pitch, perishes much sooner than such as are less
pre∣mature. In both, the encrease upwards is first accomplished; and not
till they have acquired their greatest degree of height do they begin to
spread in bulk. Man grows in stature till about the age of seventeen; but
his body is not com∣pletely <PB N="200" REF="204"/> developed till about thirty.
Dogs, on the other hand, are at their utmost size, in a year, and become as
bulky as they usually are in another. However, man who is so long in
growing continues to live for fourscore, or an hundred years; but the dog
seldom above twelve, or thirteen. In general, also, it may be said that
large animals live longer than little ones, as they usually take a larger
time to grow. But in all animals one thing is equally certain, that they carry
the causes of their own decay about them; and that their deaths are
necessary and inevitable. The prospects which some vi∣sionaries have
formed of perpetuating life by remedies, have been often enough proved false
by their own example. Such unaccountable schemes would, therefore, have died
with them, had not the love of life always augmented our credulity.</P>
<P>When the body is naturally well formed, it is possible to
lengthen out the period of life for some years by management. Temperance in
diet is often found conducive to this end. The famous Cornaro, who lived to
above an hundred years, although his constitution was naturally feeble, is a
strong instance of the benefit of an abste∣mious life. Moderation in the
passions also may contribute to extend the term of our exist∣ence. 
<PB N="201" REF="205"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"Fontenelle, the celebrated writer, was naturally of
a very weak and delicate habit of body. He was affected by the smallest
irre∣gularities; and had frequently suffered severe fits of illness from
the slightest causes. But the remarkable equality of his temper, and his
seeming want of passion, lengthened out his life to above an hundred. It
was remarkable of him, that nothing could vex or make him un∣easy; every
occurrence seemed equally pleasing; and no event, however unfortunate,
seemed to come unexpected."</Q> However, the term of life can be prolonged
but for a very little time by any art we can use. We are told of men who have
lived beyond the ordinary duration of human existence; such as Par, who
lived to an hundred and forty-four; and Jenkins to an hundred and sixty-five;
yet these men used no peculiar arts to prolong life; on the contrary, it
appears that these, as well as some others, remarkable for their longevity,
were peasants accustomed to the greatest fatigues, who had no settled
rules of diet, but who often indulged in accidental excesses. Indeed, if we
consider that the European, the Negroe, the Chinese, and the American, the
civilized man, and the savage, the rich and the poor, the inhabitant of the
city, and of the country, though all so different in other re∣spects, 
<PB N="202" REF="206"/> are yet entirely similar in the period al∣lotted them
for living; if we consider that nei∣ther the difference of race, of climate,
of nou∣rishment, of convenience, or of soil, makes any difference in the
term of life; if we consider that those men who live upon raw flesh, or
dried fishes, upon seago, or rice, upon cassava, or upon roots,
nevertheless live as long as those who are fed upon bread and meat, we
shall readily be brought to acknowledge, that the duration of life depends
neither upon habit, customs, or the quantity of food; we shall confess,
that no∣thing can change the laws of that mechanism which regulates the
number of our years, and which can chiefly be affected only by long fast∣ing,
or great excess.</P>
<P>If there be any difference in the different pe∣riods of man's
existence, it ought principally to be ascribed to the quality of the air.
It has been observed, that in elevated situations there have been found
more old people than in those that were low. The mountains of Scotland,
Wales, Auvergne, and Switzerland, have fur∣nished more instances of extreme
old age than the plains of Holland, Flanders, Germany, or Poland. But, in
general, the duration of life is nearly the same in most countries. Man, if
not cut off by accidental diseases, is generally <PB N="203" REF="207"/>
found to live to ninety or an hundred years. Our ancestors did not live
beyond that date; and, since the times of David, this term has made but
little alteration.</P>
<P>If we be asked how in the beginning men lived so much longer
than at present, and by what means their lives were extended to nine hundred
and thirty, or even nine hundred and sixty years, it may be answered, that
the pro∣ductions of the earth, upon which they fed, might be of a different
nature at that time, from what they are at present. 
<Q REND="inline">"It may be answered, that the term was abridged by
Divine command, in order to keep the earth from being over-stocked with human
inhabitants; since, if every person were now to live and ge∣nerate for nine
hundred years, mankind would be encreased to such a degree, that there
would be no room for subsistence: so that the plan of Providence would
be altered; which is seen not to produce life, without providing a proper
supply."</Q></P>
<P>But, to whatever extent life may be pro∣longed, or however some
may have delayed the effects of age, death is the certain goal to which all are
hastening. All the causes of decay which have been mentioned, contribute to
bring on this dreaded dissolution. However, nature <PB N="204" REF="208"/>
approaches to this awful period, by slow and imperceptible degrees; life is
consuming day after day; and some one of our faculties, or vital
principles, is every hour dying before the rest; so that death is only the
last shade in the picture: and it is probable, that man suffers a greater
change in going from youth to age, than from age into the grave. When we
first begin to live, our lives may scarcely be said to be our own; as the
child grows, life encreases in the same proportion; and is at its height in
the prime of manhood. But as soon as the body begins to decrease, life
decreases also; for, as the human frame diminishes, and its juices
cir∣culate in smaller quantity, life diminishes and circulates with less
vigour; so that as we begin to live by degrees, we begin to die in the same
manner.</P>
<P>Why then should we fear death, if our lives have been such as
not to make eternity dread∣ful! Why should we fear that moment which is
prepared by a thousand other moments of the same kind! the first pangs of
sickness being probably greater than the last struggles of de∣parture.
Death, in most persons, is as calmly endured as the disorder that brings
it on. If we enquire from those whose business it is to attend the
sick and the dying, we shall find that, <PB N="205" REF="209"/> except in a
very few acute cases, where the pa∣tient dies in agonies, the greatest
number die quietly, and seemingly without pain: and even the agonies of the
former, rather terrify the spectators, than torment the patient; for how many
have we not seen who have been acci∣dentally relieved from this extremity,
and yet had no memory of what they then endured. In fact, they had ceased to
live, during that time when they ceased to have sensation; and their
pains were only those of which they had an idea.</P>
<P>The greatest number of mankind die, there∣fore, without
sensation; and of those few that still preserve their faculties
entire to the last moment, there is scarce one of them that does not also
preserve the hopes of still out-living his disorder. Nature, for the
happiness of man, has rendered this sentiment stronger than his reason.
A person dying of an incurable dis∣order, which he must know to be so,
by fre∣quent examples of his case; which he perceives to be so, by the
inquietude of all around him, by the tears of his friends, and the departure or
the face of the physician, is, nevertheless, still in hopes of getting
over it. His interest is so great, that he only attends to his own
repre∣sentations; the judgment of others is considered 
<PB N="206" REF="210"/> as an hasty conclusion; and while death every moment
makes new inroads upon his con∣stitution, and destroys life in some part,
hope still seems to escape the universal ruin, and is the last that
submits to the blow.</P>
<P>Cast your eyes upon a sick man, who has an hundred times told
you that he felt himself dying, that he was convinced he could not re∣cover,
and that he was ready to expire; ex∣amine what passes on his visage,
when, through zeal or indiscretion, any one comes to tell him that his end is
at hand. You will see him change, like one who is told an unexpected piece of
news. He now appears not to have thoroughly believed what he had been telling
you himself; he doubted much; and his fears were greater than his hopes: but
he still had some feeble expectations of living, and would not have seen
the approaches of death, unless he had been alarmed by the mistaken
assiduity of his attendants.</P>
<P>Death, therefore, is not that terrible thing which we suppose it
to be. It is a spectre which frights us at a distance, but which
dis∣appears when we come to approach it more closely. Our ideas of its
terrors are conceived in prejudice, and dressed up by fancy; we re∣gard it
not only as the greatest misfortune, but <PB N="207" REF="211"/> as also an
evil accompanied with the most ex∣cruciating tortures: we have even
encreased our apprehensions, by reasoning on the extent of our
sufferings. It must be dreadful, say some, since it is sufficient
to separate the soul from the body; it must be long since our
sufferings are proportioned to the succession of our ideas; and these
being painful, must succeed each other with extreme rapidity. In this
manner has false philosophy laboured to augment the miseries of our
nature; and to aggravate that period, which Nature has kindly covered with
insensibility. Neither the mind, nor the body, can suffer these
calamities; the mind is, at that time, mostly without ideas; and the body too
much enfeebled, to be capable of perceiving its pain. A very acute pain
produces either death, or fainting, which is a state similar to death: the
body can suffer but to a certain de∣gree; if the torture becomes
excessive, it de∣stroys itself; and the mind ceases to perceive, when
the body can no longer endure.</P>
<P>In this manner, excessive pain admits of no reflection; and
wherever there are any signs of it, we may be sure that the sufferings of
the patient are no greater than what we ourselves may have remembered to
endure.</P>
<P>But, in the article of death, we have many <PB N="208" REF="212"/>
instances in which the dying person has shewn that very reflection that
pre-supposes an absence of the greatest pain; and, consequently, that
pang which ends life, cannot even be so great as those which have preceded.
Thus, when Charles XII. was shot at the siege of Frederick- shall, he was
seen to clap his hand on the hilt of his sword; and although the blow was
great enough to terminate one of the boldest and bravest lives in the
world, yet it was not painful enough to destroy reflection. He perceived
him∣self attacked; he reflected that he ought to de∣fend himself, and his
body obeyed the impulse of his mind, even in the last extremity. Thus it is
the prejudice of persons in health, and not the body in pain, that makes us
suffer from the approach of death: we have, all our lives, con∣tracted an
habit of making out excessive plea∣sures and pains; and nothing but
repeated ex∣perience shews us, how seldom the one can be suffered, or the
other enjoyed to the utmost.</P>
<P>If there be any thing necessary to confirm what we have said,
concerning the gradual cessation of life, or the insensible approaches
of our end, nothing can more effectually prove it, than the uncertainty of the
signs of death. If we consult what Winslow or Bruhier have said upon
this subject, we shall be convinced, that <PB N="209" REF="213"/> between
life and death, the shade is so very un∣distinguishable, that even all
the powers of art can scarcely determine where the one ends, and the other
begins. The colour of the visage, the warmth of the body, the suppleness
of the joints, are but uncertain signs of life still subsist∣ing;
while, on the contrary, the paleness of the complexion, the coldness of the
body, the stiff∣ness of the extremities, the cessation of all mo∣tion,
and the total insensibility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death
begun. In the same manner also, with regard to the pulse, and the
breathing, these motions are often so kept under, that it is impossible
to perceive them. By approaching a looking-glass to the mouth of the person
supposed to be dead, people often expect to find whether he breathes or
not. But this is a very uncertain experiment: the glass is frequently
sullied by the vapour of the dead man's body; and often the person is
still alive, although the glass is no way tarnished. In the same
manner, neither burning, nor scarifying, neither noises in the ears, nor
pungent spirits applied to the nostrils, give certain signs of the
discontinuance of life; and there are many in∣stances of persons who have
endured them all, and afterwards recovered, without any external 
<PB N="210" REF="214"/> assistance, to the astonishment of the
spectators. How careful, therefore, should we be, before we commit those
who are dearest to us to the grave, to be well assured of their
departure: ex∣perience, justice, humanity, all persuade us not to hasten
the funerals of our friends, but to keep their bodies unburied, until we have
cer∣tain signs of their real decease.</P>

<PB N="211" REF="215"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Varieties in the Human Race.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have compared man with other animals; we now come to
compare men with each other. We have hitherto considered him as an
individual, endowed with excellencies above the rest of the creation; we now
come to consider the advantages which men have over men, and the various
kinds with which our earth is inhabited.</P>
<P>If we compare the minute differences of mankind, there is scarce
one nation upon the earth that entirely resembles another; and there may be
said to be as many different kinds of men as there are countries inhabited.
One po∣lished nation does not differ more from another, than the merest
savages do from those savages that lie even contiguous to them; and it
fre∣quently happens that a river, or a mountain, di∣vides two barbarous tribes
that are unlike each other in manners, customs, features, and com∣plexion.
But these differences, however per∣ceivable, do not form such
distinctions as come within a general picture of the varieties of man∣kind.
Custom, accident, or fashion, may pro∣duce <PB N="212" REF="216"/>
considerable alterations in neighbouring nations; their being derived from
ancestors of a different climate, or complexion, may contri∣bute to make
accidental distinctions, which every day grow less; and it may be said,
that two neighbouring nations, how unlike soever at first, will
assimilate by degrees; and, by long continuance, the difference between
them will at last become almost imperceptible. It is not, therefore,
between contiguous nations we are to look for any strong marked varieties in
the human species; it is by comparing the inha∣bitants of opposite
climates, and distant coun∣tries; those who live within the polar circle
with those beneath the equator; those that live on one side of the globe
with those that occupy the other.</P>
<P>Of all animals, the differences between man∣kind are the
smallest. Of the lower races of creatures, the changes are so great as
often en∣tirely to disguise the natural animal, and to di∣stort, or to
disfigure its shape. But the chief differences in man are rather taken from
the tincture of his skin than the variety of his figure; and in all climates
he preserves his erect de∣portment, and the marked superiority of his form.
If we look round the world there seem to be not above six distinct
varieties in the hu∣man <PB REF="217"/> 
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of the Laplander</FIGDESC>
<HEAD>The Laplander.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>E. Martin sculp.</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="213" REF="218"/> species, each of which is
strongly marked, and speaks the kind seldom to have mixed with any
other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have taken four of these varieties from
Linnaeus; those of the Laplanders and Tartars from Mr. Buffon.</NOTE>. But
there is nothing in the shape, nothing in the faculties, that shews their
coming from different originals; and the varieties of climate, of
nourishment, and custom, are suf∣ficient to produce every change.</P>
<P>The first distinct race of men is found round the polar regions.
The Laplanders, the Esqui∣maux Indians, the Samoeid Tartars, the inha∣bitants
of Nova Zembla, the Borandians, the Greenlanders, and the natives of
Kamskatka, may be considered as one peculiar race of people, all greatly
resembling each other in their stature, their complexion, their customs,
and their ignorance. These nations being un∣der a rigorous climate, where the
productions of nature are but few, and the provisions coarse and
unwholesome, their bodies have shrunk to the nature of their food; and
their complexions have suffered, from cold, almost a similar change to
what heat is known to produce; their colour being a deep brown, in some
places inclining to actual blackness. These, therefore, in ge∣neral, are
found to be a race of short stature, and odd shape, with countenances as
savage as <PB REF="219"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="213" REF="220"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="214" REF="221"/> their manners are barbarous. The visage, in these
countries, is large and broad, the nose flat and short, the eyes of a
yellowish brown inclining to blackness, the eye-lids drawn to∣wards the
temples, the cheek-bones extremely high, the mouth very large, the lips thick
and turned outwards, the voice thin and squeak∣ing, the head large, the hair
black and streight, the colour of the skin of a dark greyish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz.</BIBL></NOTE>. They are short in stature, the
generality not being above four feet high, and the tallest not above five.
Among all these nations the women are as deformed as the men, and resemble
them so nearly that one cannot, at first, distinguish the sexes among
them.</P>
<P>These nations not only resemble each other in their deformity,
their dwarfishness, the co∣lour of their hair and eyes, but they have all,
in a great measure, the same inclinations, and the same manners, being
all equally rude, su∣perstitious, and stupid. The Danish Lap∣landers
have a large black cat, to which they communicate all their secrets, and
consult in all their affairs. Among the Swedish Lap∣landers there is in
every family a drum for con∣sulting the devil; and, although these nations
are robust, and nimble, yet they are so cowardly <PB N="215" REF="222"/>
that they never can be brought into the field. Gustavus Adolphus attempted to
make a regi∣ment of Laplanders, but he found it impossible to accomplish
his design; for it should seem that they can live only in their own
country, and in their own manner. They make use of skates, which are made
of fir, of near three feet long, and half a foot broad; these are pointed,
and raised before, and tyed to the foot by straps of leather. With these
they skate upon the icy snow with such velocity, that they very easily
overtake the swiftest animals. They make use also of a pole, pointed
with iron at one end, and rounded at the other. This pole serves to push
them along, to direct their course, to support them from falling, to stop
the im∣petuosity of their motion, and to kill that game which they have
overtaken. Upon these skates they descend the steepest mountains, and
scale the most craggy precipices; and, in these exercises, the women
are not less skilful than the men. They have all the use of the bow and
arrow, which seems to be a con∣trivance common to all barbarous nations; and
which, however, at first, required no small skill to invent. They launce
a javelin also, with great force; and some say that they can hit a mark,
no larger than a crown, at thirty yards <PB N="216" REF="223"/> distance, and
with such force as would pierce a man through. They are all hunters; and
particularly pursue the ermine, the fox, the ounce, and the martin, for the
sake of their skins. These they barter, with their southern neighbours,
for brandy and tobacco; both which they are fond of to excess. Their food is
principally dried fish, the flesh of rein-deer and bears. Their bread is
composed of the bones of fishes, pounded and mixed with the inside tender
bark of the pine tree. Their drink is train-oil, or brandy, and, when de∣prived
of these, water, in which juniper berries have been infused. With regard to
their morals, they have all the virtues of simplicity, and all the vices of
ignorance. They offer their wives and daughters to strangers; and seem to
think it a particular honour if their offer be accepted. They have no idea of
religion, or a Supreme Being; the greatest number of them are ido∣laters; and
their superstition is as profound as their worship is contemptible.
Wretched and ignorant as they are, yet they do not want pride; they set
themselves far above the rest of man∣kind; and Krantz assures us, that
when the Greenlanders are got together, nothing is so customary among them
as to turn the Euro∣peans into ridicule. They are obliged, indeed, 
<PB N="217" REF="224"/> to yield them the pre-eminence in understand∣ing, and
mechanic arts; but they do not know how to set any value upon these. They
there∣fore count themselves the only civilized and well-bred people in the
world; and it is com∣mon with them, when they see a quiet, or a modest
stranger, to say that he is almost as well bred as a Greenlander.</P>
<P>From this description, therefore, this whole race of people may be
considered as distinct from any other. Their long continuance in a climate
the most inhospitable, their being obliged to subsist on food the
most coarse and ill prepared, the savageness of their manners, and
their laborious lives, all have contri∣buted to shorten their stature, and
to deform their bodies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ellis's Voyage, p.
256.</BIBL></NOTE>. In proportion as we approach to∣wards the north pole, the
size of the natives appears to diminish, growing less and less as we
advance higher, till we come to those la∣titudes that are destitute of all
inhabitants what∣soever.</P>
<P>The wretched natives of these climates seem fitted by nature to
endure the rigours of their situation. As their food is but scanty and
precarious, their patience in hunger is amaz∣ing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz. p. 134, vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. A man, who has ate
nothing for four days, can manage his little canoe, in the most 
<PB N="218" REF="225"/> furious waves, and calmly subsist in the midst
of a tempest, that would quickly dash an Eu∣ropean boat to pieces. Their
strength is not less amazing than their patience; a woman among them will
carry a piece of timber, or a stone, near double the weight of what an
European can lift. Their bodies are of a dark grey all over; and their faces
brown, or olive. The tincture of their skins partly seems to arise from
their dirty manner of living, being generally daubed with train-oil; and partly
from the rigours of climate, as the sudden alterations of cold and raw air in
winter, and of burning heats in summer, shade their com∣plexions by
degrees, till, in a succession of ge∣nerations, they at last become
almost black. As the countries in which these reside are the most
barren, so the natives seem the most bar∣barous of any part of the earth.
Their more southern neighbours of America, treat them with the same scorn
that a polished nation would treat a savage one; and we may readily judge
of the rudeness of those manners, which even a native of Canada can think
more barbarous than his own.</P>
<P>But the gradations of nature are imper∣ceptible; and, while the
north is peopled with such miserable inhabitants, there are here and there
to be found, upon the edges of these <PB N="219" REF="226"/> regions, people
of larger stature, and completer figure. A whole race of the dwarfish breed
is often found to come down from the north, and settle more to the
southward; and, on the contrary, it sometimes happens that southern
nations are seen higher up, in the midst of these diminutive tribes,
where they have continued for time immemorial. Thus the Ostiac Tartars seem
to be a race that have travelled down from the north, and to be originally
sprung from the minute savages we have been describing. There are also
Norwegians, and Finlanders, of proper stature, who are seen to inhabit in
latitudes higher even than Lapland. These, however, are but accidental
migrations, and serve as shades to unite the distinct varieties of
man∣kind.</P>
<P>The second great variety, in the human spe∣cies, seems to be
that of the Tartar race; from whence, probably, the little men we have been
describing originally proceeded. The Tartar country, taken in general,
comprehends the greatest part of Asia; and is, consequently, a general
name given to a number of nations, of various forms and complexions. But,
however they seem to differ from each other, they all agree in being very
unlike the people of any other country whatsoever. All these nations 
<PB N="220" REF="227"/> have the upper part of the visage very broad, and
wrinkled even while yet in their youth. Their noses are short and flat,
their eyes little and sunk in their heads; and, in some of them, they are
seen five or six inches asunder. Their cheek-bones are high, the lower
part of their visage narrow, the chin long and advanced forward, their teeth
of an enormous size and growing separate from each other, their eye-brows
thick and large and covering their eyes, their eye-lids thick, the face broad
and flat, the complexion olive coloured, and the hair black. They are of a
middle size, extremely strong, and very robust. They have but little
beard, which grows straglingly on the chin. They have large thighs, and
short legs. The ugliest of all are the Calmoucks, in whose ap∣pearance
there seems to be something frightful. They all lead an erratic life,
remaining under tents of hair, or skins. They live upon horse flesh and
that of camels, either raw or a little sodden between the horse and the
saddle. They eat also fish dried in the sun. Their most usual drink
is mares milk fermented with mil∣let ground into meal. They all have the head
shaven, except a lock of hair, on the top, which they let grow sufficiently
long to form into tresses, on each side of the face. The <PB REF="228"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="221" REF="229"/> women, who are as ugly as the men,
wear their hair, which they bind up with bits of copper and other ornaments of
a like nature. The ma∣jority of these nations have no religion, no settled
notions of morality, no decency of be∣haviour. They are chiefly robbers: and
the natives of Dagestan, who live near their more polished neighbours, make
a traffic of Tartar slaves who have been stolen, and sell them to the
Turks and the Persians. Their chief riches consist in horses, of which
perhaps there are more in Tartary, than in any other part of the world. The
natives are taught by custom to live in the same place with their horses;
they are continually employed in managing them, and at last bring them to
such great obedience, that the horse seems actually to understand the
rider's intention.</P>
<P>To this race of men also, we must refer the Chinese and the
Japanese, however different they seem in their manners and ceremonies. It
is the form of the body that we are now principally con∣sidering; and there
is, between these countries, a surprizing resemblance. It is in general
al∣lowed that the Chinese have broad faces, small eyes, flat noses, and
scarce any beard; that they are broad and square shouldered, and rather
less in stature than Europeans. These are marks <PB REF="230"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="222" REF="232"/> common
to them and the Tartars, and they may, therefore, be considered as being
derived from the same original. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have observed," says Chardin, "that in all
the people from the east and the north of the Caspian sea, to the
peninsula of Malacca, that the lines of the face, and the formation of the
visage, is the same. This has induced me to believe, that all these
nations are derived from the same ori∣ginal, however different either their
complex∣ions or their manners may appear: for as to the complexion, that
proceeds entirely from the climate and the food; and as to the manners, these
are generally the result of their different degrees of wealth or power."</Q>
That they come from one stock, is evident also, from this; that the Tartars
who settle in China, quickly re∣semble the Chinese; and, on the contrary,
the Chinese who settle in Tartary, soon assume the figure, and the
manners, of the Tartars.</P>
<P>The Japanese so much resemble the Chinese, that one cannot
hesitate to rank them in the same class. They only differ in being rather
browner, as they inhabit a more southern cli∣mate. They are, in general,
described, as of a brown complexion, a short stature, a broad flat face,
a very little beard, and black hair. Their customs and ceremonies are nearly
the same; <PB N="223" REF="233"/> their ideas of beauty similar; and their
artificial deformities of blackening the teeth, and ban∣daging the feet,
entirely alike in both countries. They both, therefore, proceed from the same
stock; and although they differ very much from their brutal progenitors, yet
they owe their civilization wholly to the mildness of the climate in which
they reside, and to the peculiar fertility of the soil. To this tribe
also, we may refer the Cochin Chinese, the Siamese, the Ton∣quinese,
and the inhabitants of Aracan, Laos, and Pegu, who, though all differing from
the Chinese, and each other, nevertheless, have too strong a
resemblance, not to betray their com∣mon original.</P>
<P>Another, which makes the third variety in the human species, is
that of the southern Asiatics; the form of whose features and persons
may be easily distinguished from those of the Tartar races. The nations
that inhabit the pe∣ninsula of India, seem to be the principal stock from
whence the inhabitants of the islands that lie scattered in the Indian
ocean, have been peopled. They are, in general, of a slender shape, with
long strait black hair, and often with Roman noses. Thus they resemble
the Europeans in stature and features; but greatly differ in colour and habit
of body. The Indians <PB N="224" REF="234"/> are of an olive colour, and, in the
more southern parts, quite black; although the word Mogul, in their language,
signifies a white man. The women are extremely delicate, and bathe very
often: they are of an olive colour, as well as the men; their legs and thighs
are long, and their bodies short, which is the opposite to what is seen
among the women of Europe. They are, as I am assured, by no means so
fruitful as the European women; but they feel the pains of child-birth with
much less sensibility, and are generally up and well the day following.
In fact, these pains seem greatest in all countries where the women are
most delicate, or the con∣stitution enfeebled by luxury or indolence. The
women of savage nations seem, in a great mea∣sure, exempt from painful
labours; and even the hard working wives of the peasants among ourselves,
have this advantage, from a life of industry, that their child bearing is
less painful. Over all India, the children arrive sooner at maturity, than
with us of Europe. They often marry, and consummate, the husband at ten
years old, and the wife at eight; and they fre∣quently have children at that
age. However, the women who are mothers so soon, cease bear∣ing before
they are arrived at thirty; and, at that time, they appear wrinkled, and seem
<PB N="225" REF="235"/> marked with all the deformities of age. The Indians have
long been remarkable for their cowardice and effeminacy; every conqueror that
has but attempted the invasion of their country, having succeeded. The
warmth of the climate entirely influences their manners; they are slothful,
submissive and luxurious: satisfied with sensual happiness alone,
they find no plea∣sure in thinking; and contented with slavery, they are
ready to obey any master. Many tribes among them eat nothing that has life;
they are fearful of killing the meanest insect; and have even erected
hospitals for the main∣tenance of all kinds of vermin. The Asiatic dress
also, is a loose flowing garment, rather fitted for the purposes of peace
and indolence, than of industry or war. The vigour of the Asiatics is
therefore in general conformable to their dress and nourishment: fed upon
rice, and cloathed in effeminate silk vestments, their soldiers are
unable to oppose the onset of an European army; and, from the times of
Alex∣ander to the present day we have scarce any instances of their
success in arms. Upon the whole, therefore, they may be considered as a
feeble race of sensualists, too dull to find rap∣ture in any pleasures,
and too indolent to turn their gravity into wisdom. To this class we may 
<PB N="226" REF="236"/> refer the Persians and Arabians, and, in general, the
inhabitants of the islands that lie scattered in the Indian ocean.</P>
<P>The fourth striking variety in the human species, is to be found
among the Negroes of Africa. This gloomy race of mankind is found to blacken
all the southern parts of Africa, from eighteen degrees north of the line, to
its extreme termination, at the Cape of Good Hope. I know it is said, that
the Caffres, who inhabit the southern extremity of that large continent, are
not to be ranked among the Negroe race; however, the difference between them,
in point of colour and features, is so small, that they may very easily
be grouped in this general picture; and in the one or two that I have seen, I
could perceive not the smallest difference. Each of the Negroe nations, it
must be owned, differ among each other; they have their peculiar countries
for beauty, like us; and different nations, as in Europe, pride themselves
upon the regularity of their features. Those of Guinea, for instance, are
extremely ugly, and have an-insupportable scent; those of Mosam∣bique,
are reckoned beautiful, and have no ill smell whatsoever. The Negroes, in
general, are of a black colour, with a smooth soft skin. This
smoothness proceeds from the downy soft∣ness <PB REF="237"/>

hair which grows upon it; the strength of which gives a roughness to the
feel, in those of a white complexion. Their skins, therefore, have a velvet
smoothness, and seem less braced upon the muscles than ours. The hair
of their heads differs entirely from what we are accustomed to, being soft,
woolly, and short. The beard also, partakes of the same qualities: but in
this it differs, that it soon turns grey, which the hair is seldom found to
do; so that several are seen with white beards, and black hair, at the
same time. Their eyes are generally of a deep hazle; their noses flat and
short; their lips thick and tumid; and their teeth of an ivory whiteness.
This their only beauty, however, is set off by the colour of their skin;
the contrast between the black and white being the more observable. It is
false to say that their features are deformed by art; since, in the
Negroe children born in European countries, the same deformities are seen
to prevail; the same flatness in the nose; and the same promi∣nence in
the lips. They are, in general, said to be well shaped; but of such as I
have seen, I never found one that might be justly called so; their legs
being mostly ill formed, and most commonly bending outward on the
shin-bone. But it is not only in those parts of their bodies 
<PB N="228" REF="241"/> that are obvious, that they are disproportioned;
those parts which among us are usually con∣cealed by dress, with them are
large and lan∣guid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">

one child, hang down below the navel; and it is customary, with them, to
suckle the child at their backs, by throwing the breast over the
shoulder. As their persons are thus naturally deformed, at least to our
imaginations, their minds are equally incapable of strong exertions. The
climate seems to relax their mental powers still more than those of the
body; they are, therefore, in general, found to be stupid, in∣dolent, and
mischievous. The Arabians them∣selves, many colonies of whom have migrated
southward into the most inland parts of Africa, seem to have degenerated
from their ancestors; and forgetting their ancient learning, with their
beauty, have become a race scarce any way distinguishable from the
original natives. Nor does it seem to have fared otherwise with the
Portuguese, who, about two centuries ago, settled along this coast. They
also are become <PB REF="242"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="229" REF="243"/> almost as black as the Negroes;
and are said, by some, to be even more barbarous.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of America make a fifth race, as different from all
the rest in colour, as they are distinct in habitation. The natives of
America (except in the northern extremity, where they resemble the
Laplanders) are of a red or copper colour; and although, in the old world,
different climates produce a variety of complexions and customs, the natives
of the new continent seem to resemble each other in almost every
respect. They are all nearly of one colour; all have black thick strait
hair, and thin black beards; which, however, they take care to pluck out by the
roots. They have, in general, flat noses, with high cheek bones, and small
eyes; and these deformities of nature they endeavour to encrease by art:
they flatten the nose, and often the whole head of their children, while the
bones are yet susceptible of every impression. They paint the body and
face of various colours, and consider the hair upon any part of it, except
the head, as a deformity which they are careful to eradicate. Their limbs are
generally slighter made than those of the Europeans; and I am assured,
they are far from being so strong. All these savages seem to be
cowardly; they seldom are known to face their <PB REF="244"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="230" REF="246"/> enemies
in the field, but fall upon them at an advantage; and the greatness of their
fears serves to encrease the rigours of their cruelty. The wants which they
often sustain, makes them surprizingly patient in adversity;
distress, by being grown familiar, becomes less terrible; so that their
patience is less the result of for∣titude than of custom. They have all a
serious air, although they seldom think; and, how∣ever cruel to their
enemies, are kind and just to each other. In short, the customs of
savage nations in every country are almost the same; a wild, independent,
and precarious life, pro∣duces a peculiar train of virtues and vices: and
patience and hospitality, indolence and rapa∣city, content and sincerity,
are found not less among the natives of America, than all the barbarous
nations of the globe.</P>
<P>The sixth and last variety of the human species, is that of
the Europeans, and the nations bordering on them. In this class we may reckon
the Georgians, Circassians, and Mingre∣lians, the inhabitants of Asia
Minor, and the northern parts of Africa, together with a part of those
countries which lie north-west of the Caspian sea. The inhabitants of
these countries differ a good deal from each other; but they generally agree
in the colour of their bodies, <PB N="231" REF="247"/> the beauty of their
complexions, the largeness of their limbs, and the vigour of their
under∣standings. Those arts which might have had their invention among the
other races of man∣kind, have come to perfection there. In bar∣barous
countries, the inhabitants go either naked, or are awkwardly cloathed in furs
or feathers; in countries semi-barbarous, the robes are loose and flowing;
but here the cloathing is less made for shew than expedition, and unites,
as much as possible, the extremes of or∣nament and dispatch.</P>
<P>To one or other of these classes, we may re∣fer the people of
every country; and as each nation has been less visited by strangers, or
has had less commerce with the rest of mankind, we find their persons,
and their manners, more strongly impressed with one or other of the
cha∣racters mentioned above. On the contrary, in those places where trade has
long flourished, or where enemies have made many incursions, the races are
usually found blended, and pro∣perly fall beneath no one character. Thus, in
the islands of the Indian ocean, where a trade has been carried on for time
immemorial, the inhabitants appear to be a mixture of all the nations upon the
earth; white, olive, brown, and black men, are all seen living together in 
<PB N="232" REF="248"/> the same city, and propagate a mixed breed, that can
be referred to none of the classes into which naturalists have thought
proper to divide mankind.</P>
<P>Of all the colours by which mankind is di∣versified, it is easy
to perceive, that ours is not only the most beautiful to the eye, but the
most advantageous. The fair com∣plexion seems, if I may so express it,
as a transparent covering to the soul; all the varia∣tions of the
passions, every expression of joy or sorrow, flows to the cheek, and,
without language, marks the mind. In the slightest change of health also,
the colour of the Eu∣ropean face is the most exact index, and often teaches
us to prevent those disorders that we do not as yet perceive: not but that
the African black, and the Asiatic olive complexions, admit of their
alterations also; but these are neither so distinct, nor so
visible, as with us; and, in some countries, the colour of the visage is
never found to change; but the face continues in the same settled shade
in shame, and in sickness, in anger, and despair.</P>
<P>The colour, therefore, most natural to man, ought to be that which
is most becoming; and it is found, that, in all regions, the children are
born fair, or at least red, and that they grow more black, or tawny, as they
advance in age. <PB N="233" REF="249"/> It should seem, consequently, that
man is na∣turally white; since the same causes that darken the complexion
in infants, may have originally operated, in slower degrees, in blackening
whole nations. We could, therefore, readily account for the blackness of
different nations, did we not see the Americans, who live under the line, as
well as the natives of Negroland, of a red colour, and but a very small
shade darker than the natives of the northern lati∣tudes, in the same
continent. For this reason, some have sought for other causes of
blackness than the climate; and have endeavoured to prove that the blacks are
a race of people, bred from one man, who was marked with acciden∣tal
blackness. This, however, is but mere un∣grounded conjecture; and, although
the Ame∣ricans are not so dark as the Negroes, yet we must still continue
in the ancient opinion, that the deepness of the colour proceeds from the
excessive heat of the climate. For, if we com∣pare the heats of Africa with
those of America, we shall find they bear no proportion to each other. In
America, all that part of the conti∣nent which lies under the line, is cool and
plea∣sant, either shaded by mountains, or refreshed by breezes from the
sea. But, in Africa, the wide tract of country that lies under the line is
very <PB N="232" REF="250"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="233" REF="251"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="234" REF="252"/> extensive, and the soil sandy; the reflexion of
the sun, therefore, from so large a surface of earth, is almost
intolerable; and it is not to be wondered at, that the inhabitants should
bear, in their looks, the marks of the inhospitable climate. In America, the
country is but thinly inhabited; and the more torrid tracts are gene∣rally left
desert by the inhabitants; for which reason they are not so deeply tinged
by the beams of the sun. But in Africa the whole face of the country is fully
peopled; and the natives are obliged to endure their situation, without a
power of migration. It is there, consequently, that they are in a manner tied
down to feel all the severity of the heat; and their complexions take the
darkest hue they are capable of receiving. We need not, there∣fore, have
recourse to any imaginary propaga∣tion, from persons accidentally black,
since the climate is a cause obvious, and sufficient to produce the
effect.</P>
<P>In fact if we examine the complexions of dif∣ferent countries, we
shall find them darken in proportion to the heat of their climate; and the
shades gradually to deepen as they approach the line. Some nations, indeed,
may be found not so much tinged by the sun as others, although they lie
nearer the line. But this ever proceeds <PB N="235" REF="253"/> from some
accidental causes; either from the country lying higher, and consequently
being colder; or from the natives bathing oftener, and leading a more civilized
life. In gene∣ral, it may be asserted, that, as we approach the line, we
find the inhabitants of each country grow browner, until the colour deepens
into perfect blackness. Thus taking our standard from the whitest race of
people, and beginning with our own country, which, I believe, bids fairest
for the pre-eminence, we shall find the French, who are more southern, a
slight shade deeper than we; going farther down, the Spaniards are browner
than the French; the in∣habitants of Fez darker than they; and the na∣tives of
Negroeland the darkest of all. In what manner the sun produces this effect,
and how the same luminary which whitens wax and linen, should darken the
human complexion, is not easy to conceive. Sir Thomas Brown first
supposed that a mucous substance, which had something of a vitriolic
quality, settled under the reticular membrane, and grew darker with heat.
Others have supposed that the blackness lay in the epi∣dermis, or scarf
skin, which was burnt up like leather. But nothing has been satisfactorily
discovered upon the subject; it is sufficient that we are assured of
the fact; and that we have no <PB N="236" REF="254"/> doubt of the sun's
tinging the complexion in proportion to its vicinity.</P>
<P>But we are not to suppose that the sun is the only cause of
darkening the skin; the wind, extreme cold, hard labour, or coarse and
spar∣ing nourishment, are all found to contribute to this effect. We find
the peasants of every country, who are most exposed to the weather, a
shade darker than the higher ranks of people. The savage inhabitants of all
places are exposed still more, and, therefore, contract a still deeper
hue; and this will account for the tawny colour of the North American Indians.
Although they live in a climate the same, or even more northerly than ours,
yet they are found to be of complexions very different from those of Europe.
But it must be considered that they live continually exposed to the
sun; that they use many methods to darken their skins by art, painting
them with red oker, and anointing them with the fat of bears. Had they taken,
for a succession of several generations, the same precautions to
brighten their colour that an Eu∣ropean does, it is very probable that they
would in time come to have similar com∣plexions; and, perhaps, dispute the
prize of beauty.</P>
<P>The extremity of cold is not less productive <PB N="237" REF="255"/> of a tawny complexion than that of heat. The natives of the artic
circle, as was observed, are all brown; and those that lie most to the
north are almost entirely black. In this manner both extremes are
unfavourable to the human form and colour, and the same effects are produced
under the poles that are found at the line.</P>
<P>With regard to the stature of different coun∣tries, that seems
chiefly to result from the na∣ture of the food, and the quantity of the
sup∣ply. Not but that the severity of heat or cold, may, in some
measure, diminish the growth, and produce a dwarfishness of make. But,
in general, the food is the great agent in produc∣ing this effect; where that
is supplied in large quantities, and, where its quality is wholesome and
nutrimental, the inhabitants are generally seen above the ordinary stature.
On the con∣trary, where it is afforded in a sparing q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ty, or very coarse, and void of nourishment in its
kind, the inhabitants degenerate, and sink be∣low the ordinary size of
mankind. In this re∣spect they resemble other animals, whose bo∣dies, by
proper feeding, may be greatly aug∣mented. An ox, on the fertile plains of
India, grows to a size four times as large as the dimi∣nutive animal of the
same kind bred in the <PB N="238" REF="256"/> Alps. The horses bred in the
plains are larger than those of the mountain. So it is with man; the
inhabitants of the valley are usually found taller than those of the hill:
the natives of the Highlands of Scotland, for instance, are short, broad,
and hardy; those of the Lowlands are tall and shapely. The inhabitants of
Green∣land, who live upon dried fish and seals, are less than those of
Gambia or Senegal, where Nature supplies them with vegetable and ani∣mal
abundance.</P>
<P>The form of the face seems rather to be the result of custom.
Nations who have long con∣sidered some artificial deformity as beautiful,
who have industriously lessened the feet, or flattened the nose, by
degrees, begin to receive the im∣pression they are taught to assume;
and Nature, in a course of ages, shapes itself to the con∣straint, and
assumes hereditary deformity. We find nothing more common in births than
for children to inherit sometimes even the accidental deformities of their
parents. We have many instances of squinting in the father, which he
received from fright, or habit, communicated to the offspring; and I myself
have seen a child distinctly marked with a scar, similar to one the
father had received in battle. In this man∣ner <PB N="239" REF="257"/>
accidental deformities may become natural ones; and by assiduity may be
continued, and even encreased, through successive generations. From
this, therefore, may have arisen the small eyes and long ears of the
Tartars, and Chinese nations. From hence originally may have come the flat
noses of the blacks, and the flat heads of the American Indians.</P>
<P>In this slight survey, therefore, I think we may see that all
the variations in the human figure, as far as they differ from our own, are
produced either by the rigour of the climate, the bad quality, or the
scantiness of the pro∣visions, or by the savage customs of the
country. They are actual marks of the degeneracy in the human form; and we may
consider the Eu∣ropean figure and colour as standards to which to refer all
other varieties, and with which to compare them. In proportion as the Tartar or
American approaches nearer to European beauty, we consider the race as less
degenerated; in pro∣portion as he differs more widely, he has made greater
deviations from his original form.</P>
<P>That we have all sprung from one common parent, we are taught,
both by reason and re∣ligion, to believe; and we have good reason also to
think that the Europeans resemble him <PB N="240" REF="258"/> more than any of
the rest of his children. How∣ever, it must not be concealed that the olive
coloured Asiatic, and even the jet black Ne∣groe, claim this honour of
hereditary resem∣blance; and assert that white men are mere de∣viations
from original perfection. Odd as this opinion may seem, they have got
Linnaeus, the celebrated naturalist, on their side; who sup∣poses man a
native of the tropical climates, and only a sojourner more to the north. But,
not to enter into a controversy upon a matter of a very remote speculation,
I think one argument alone will suffice to prove the contrary, and shew
that the white man is the original source from whence the other varieties
have sprung. We have frequently seen white children pro∣duced from black
parents, but have never seen a black offspring the production of two whites.
From hence we may conclude that whiteness is the colour to which mankind
naturally tends; for, as in the tulip, the parent stock is known by all the
artificial varieties breaking into it; so in man, that colour must be
original which never alters, and to which all the rest are acciden∣tally
seen to change. I have seen in London, at different times, two white
Negroes, the issue of black parents, that served to convince me of 
<PB N="241" REF="259"/> the truth of this theory. I had before been taught to
believe that the whiteness of the Negroe skin was a disease, a kind of
milky whiteness, that might be called rather a leprous crust than a
na∣tural complexion. I was taught to suppose that the numberless white
Negroes, found in va∣rious parts of Africa, the white men that go by the name
of Chacrelas, in the East-Indies, and the white Americans, near the Isthmus
of Da∣rien, in the West Indies, were all as so many diseased persons,
and even more deformed than the blackest of the natives. But, upon ex∣amining
that Negroe which was last shewn in London, I found the colour to be
exactly like that of an European; the visage white and ruddy, and the lips of
the proper redness. However, there were sufficient marks to con∣vince me of
its descent. The hair was white and woolly, and very unlike any thing I had
seen before. The iris of the eye was yellow, inclining to red; the nose was
flat, exactly re∣sembling that of a Negroe; and the lips thick, and
prominent. No doubt, therefore, re∣mained of the child's having been born of
Ne∣groe parents; and the person who shewed it had attestations to
convince the most incredu∣lous. From this then we see that the variations 
<PB N="242" REF="260"/> of the Negroe colour is into whiteness, whereas the
white are never found to have a race of Ne∣groe children. Upon the whole,
therefore, all those changes which the African, the Asiatic, or the
American undergo, are but accidental defor∣mities, which a kinder climate,
better nou∣rishment, or more civilized manners, would, in a course of
centuries, very probably, re∣move.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of Monsters.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO I have only spoken of those varieties in the human
species, that are com∣mon to whole nations; but there are varieties of
another kind, which are only found in the individual; and, being more rarely
seen, are, therefore, called monstrous. If we examine into the varieties of
distorted nature, there is scarce a limb of the body, or scarce a feature
in the face, that has not suffered some repro∣bation, either from art or
nature; being en∣larged or diminished, lengthened or wrested, from its due
proportion. Linnaeus, after hav∣ing given a catalogue of monsters,
particularly adds, the flat heads of Canada, the long heads of the Chinese,
and the slender waists of the women of Europe, who, by strait lacing,
take such pains to destroy their health, through a mistaken de∣sire to
improve their beauty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Syst. vol. i. p.

physician than the naturalist to attend to these minute deformities; and,
indeed, it is a melancholly contemplation to speculate upon a catalogue of
calamities, inflicted by unpitying <PB N="244" REF="262"/> nature, or brought
upon us by our own ca∣price. Some, however, are fond of such ac∣counts; and

infinite; and, perhaps, their use is as much circumscribed as their variety
is extensive.</NOTE>. It is sufficient here to observe, that every day's
experience must have shewn us miserable instances of this kind,
produced by nature, or affectation; calamities that no pity can soften, nor
assiduity relieve.</P>
<P>Passing over, therefore, every other account, 
<PB N="245" REF="263"/> I shall only mention the famous instance, quoted by
Father Malbranche; upon which he founds his beautiful theory of monstrous
pro∣ductions. A woman of Paris, the wife of a tradesman, went to see a
criminal broke alive upon the wheel, at the place of public execu∣tion. She was
at that time two months ad∣vanced in her pregnancy, and no way subject to any
disorders to affect the child in her womb. She was, however, of a tender
habit of body; and, though led by curiosity to this horrid spectacle, very
easily moved to pity and compassion. She felt, therefore, all those
strong emotions which so terrible a sight must naturally inspire;
shud∣dered at every blow the criminal received, and almost swooned at his
cries. Upon returning from this scene of blood, she continued for some
days pensive, and her imagination still wrought upon the spectacle she
had lately seen. After some time, however, she seemed perfectly
re∣covered from her fright, and had almost for∣gotten her former
uneasiness. When the time of her delivery approached, she seemed no
ways mindful of her former terrors, nor were her pains in labour more than
usual in such cir∣cumstances. But, what was the amazement of her friends,
and assistants, when the child came into the world! It was found that
every <PB N="246" REF="264"/> limb in its body was broken just like those of
the malefactor, and just in the same place. This poor infant, that had
suffered the pains of life, even before its coming into the world, did not
die, but lived in an hospital, in Paris, for twenty years after, a wretched
in∣stance of the supposed power of imagination in the mother of altering
and distorting the infant in the womb. The manner in which Mal∣branche
reasons upon this fact, is as follows. The Creator has established such
a sympathy between the several parts of nature, that we are led not only to
imitate each other, but also to partake in the same affections and
desires. The animal spirits are thus carried to the re∣spective parts of
the body, to perform the same actions which we see others perform, to
receive in some measure their wounds, and take part in their sufferings.
Experience tells us, that if we look attentively on any person severely
beaten, or sorely wounded, the spirits imme∣diately flow into those parts
of the body which correspond to those we see in pain. The more delicate
the constitution, the more it is thus af∣fected; the spirits making a
stronger impres∣sion on the fibres of a weakly habit than of a robust
one. Strong vigorous men see an exe∣cution without much concern, while women
of <PB N="247" REF="265"/> nicer texture are struck with horror and con∣cern.
This sensibility in them must, of con∣sequence, be communicated to all
parts of their body; and, as the fibres of the child, in the womb, are
incomparably finer than those of the mother, the course of the animal
spirits must, consequently, produce greater altera∣tions. Hence, every
stroke given to the cri∣minal, forcibly struck the imagination of the
woman; and, by a kind of counter stroke, the delicate tender frame of the
child.</P>
<P>Such is the reasoning of an ingenious man, upon a fact, the
veracity of which many since have called in question<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. 4, p. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>. They have allowed,
indeed, that such a child might have been produced, but have denied the
cause of its de∣formity. How could the imagination of the mother, say they,
produce such dreadful ef∣fects upon her child? She has no communica∣tion with
the infant; she scarce touches it in any part; quite unaffected with her
concerns, it sleeps in security, in a manner secluded by a fluid in which
it swims, from her that bears it. With what a variety of deformities, say
they, would all mankind be marked, if all the vain and capricious desires of
the mother were thus readily written upon the body of the child? 
<PB N="248" REF="266"/> Yet, notwithstanding this plausible way of
reasoning, I cannot avoid still giving some credit to the variety of
instances I have either read, or seen, upon this subject. If it be a
prejudice, it is as old as the days of Aristotle, and to this day as
strongly believed, by the ge∣nerality of mankind, as ever. It does not ad∣mit
of a reason; and, indeed, I can give none even why the child should, in any
respect, re∣semble the father, or the mother. The fact we generally find to
be so. But why it should take the particular print of the father's features
in the womb, is as hard to conceive, as why it should be affected by the
mother's imagination. We all know what a strong effect the imagi∣nation has
on those parts in particular, without being able to assign a cause how
this effect is produced; and why the imagination may not produce the same
effect in marking the child that it does in forming it, I see no reason.
Those persons whose employment it is to rear up pidgeons of different
colours, can breed them, as their expression is, to a feather. In fact, by
properly paring them, they can give what colour they will to any feather, in
any part of the body. Were we to reason upon this fact, what could we say?
Might it not be asserted, that the egg, being distinct from the body of 
<PB N="249" REF="267"/> the female, cannot be influenced by it? Might it not be
plausibly said, that there is no simili∣tude between any part of the egg
and any par∣ticular feather, which we expect to propagate? and yet, for all
this, the fact is known to be true, and what no speculation can invalidate.
In the same manner, a thousand various in∣stances assure us that the
child, in the womb, is sometimes marked by the strong affections of the
mother; how this is performed we know not; we only see the effect, without
any connexion between it and the cause. The best physicians have allowed
it; and have been sa∣tisfied to submit to the experience of a number of
ages; but many disbelieve it, because they expect a reason for every
effect. This, however, is very hard to be given, while it is very easy to
appear wise by pretending incredulity.</P>
<P>Among the number of monsters, dwarfs and giants are usually
reckoned; though not, per∣haps, with the strictest propriety, since they
are no way different from the rest of mankind, except in stature. It is a
dispute, however, about words; and, therefore, scarce worth con∣tending
about. But there is a dispute, of a more curious nature, on this subject;
namely, whe∣ther there are races of people thus very dimi∣nutive, or vastly
large, or whether they be <PB N="250" REF="268"/> merely accidental varieties,
that now and then are seen in a country, in a few persons, whose bodies
some external cause has contributed to lessen, or enlarge.</P>
<P>With regard to men of diminutive stature, all antiquity has been
unanimous in asserting their national existence. Homer was the first
who has given us an account of the pigmy na∣tion, contending with the cranes;
and what po∣etical licence might be supposed to exaggerate, Athenaeus has
attempted seriously to confirm by historical assertion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Athenaeus. ix. 390.</BIBL></NOTE>. If we attend to these,
we must believe that in the internal parts of Africa, there are whole nations
of pigmy be∣ings, not more than a foot in stature, who continually wage an
unequal war with the birds and beasts that inhabit the plains in which they
reside. Some of the ancients, however, and Strabo in particular, have
supposed all these accounts to be fabulous; and have been more inclined
to think this supposed nation of pig∣mies, nothing more than a species of
apes, well known to be numerous in that part of the world. With this opinion
the moderns have all con∣curred; and that diminutive race, which was
described as human, has been long degraded into a class of animals that
resemble us but very imperfectly.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="269"/>The existence, therefore, of a pigmy race of
mankind, being founded in error, or in fable, we can expect to find men of
diminutive stature only by accident, among men of the ordinary size. Of
these accidental dwarfs, every country, and almost every village, can
produce numerous instances. There was a time, when these un∣favoured
children of Nature, were the peculiar favourites of the great; and no prince,
or no∣bleman, thought himself completely attended, unless he had a dwarf
among the number of his domestics. These poor little men were kept to be
laughed at; or to raise the barbarous pleasure of their masters, by their
contrasted inferiority. Even in England, as late as the times of king James
the First, the court was at one time fur∣nished with a dwarf, a giant, and
a jester: these the king often took a pleasure in opposing to each
other, and often fomented quarrels among them, in order to be a concealed
spectator of their animosity. It was a particular entertainment of the
courtiers at that time, to see little Jeffery, for so the dwarf was called,
ride round the lists, expecting his antagonist; and discovering, in his
actions, all the marks of contemptible re∣solution.</P>
<P>It was in the same spirit, that Peter of Russia, in the year
1710, celebrated a marriage of <PB N="252" REF="270"/> dwarfs. This monarch,
though raised by his native genius far above a barbarian, was,
never∣theless, still many degrees removed from actual refinement. His
pleasures, therefore, were of the vulgar kind; and this was among the
num∣ber. Upon a certain day, which he had ordered to be proclaimed several
months before, he in∣vited the whole body of his courtiers, and all the foreign
ambassadors, to be present at the marriage of a pigmy man and woman. The
preparations for this wedding were not only very grand, but executed in a
style of barbarous ridi∣cule. He ordered, that all the dwarf men and women,
within two hundred miles, should re∣pair to the capital; and also
insisted, that they should be present at the ceremony. For this
purpose, he supplied them with proper vehicles; but so contrived it, that
one horse was seen car∣rying in a dozen of them into the city at once,
while the mob followed shouting, and laughing, from behind. Some of them were
at first unwil∣ling to obey an order, which they knew was cal∣culated to turn
them into ridicule, and did not come; but he soon obliged them to obey; and,
as a punishment, enjoined, that they should wait upon the rest at dinner.
The whole company of dwarfs amounted to seventy, beside the bride and
bridegroom, who were richly adorned, and <PB N="253" REF="271"/> in the
extremity of the fashion. For this little company in miniature, every thing
was suitably provided; a low table, small plates, little glasses, and,
in short, every thing was so fitted, as if all things had been dwindled to
their own standard. It was his great pleasure to see their gravity and
their pride; the contention of the women for places, and the men for
superiority. This point he attempted to adjust, by ordering, that the
most diminutive should take the lead; but this bred disputes, for none
would then consent to sit foremost. All this, however, being at last
settled, dancing followed the din∣ner, and the ball was opened with a minuet
by the bridegroom, who measured exactly three feet two inches high. In the
end, matters were so contrived, that this little company, who met together in
gloomy pride, and unwilling to be pleased, being at last familiarized to
laughter, joined in the diversion, and became, as the journalist has
it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Die dench wurdige. Iwerg. Hocksheit, &amp;c.
Lipsiae, 1713. vol. viii. page 102. seq.</BIBL></NOTE>, extremely
sprightly and en∣tertaining.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the entertainment such guests might afford,
when united, I never found a dwarf capable of affording any when alone. I have
sometimes conversed with some of these <PB N="254" REF="272"/> that were
exhibited at our fairs about town, and have ever found their intellects as
con∣tracted as their persons. They, in general, seemed to me to have
faculties very much re∣sembling those of children, and their desires
seemed of the same kind; being diverted with the same sports, and
best pleased with such companions. Of all those I have seen, which
may amount to five or six, the little man, whose name was Coan, that died
lately at Chelsea, was the most intelligent and sprightly. I have heard
him and the giant, who sung at the theatres, sustain a very ridiculous
duet, to which they were taught to give great spirit. But this mirth, and
seeming sagacity, were but assumed. He had, by long habit, been taught
to look chearful upon the approach of com∣pany; and his conversation was but
the mere etiquette of a person that had been used to re∣ceive visitors.
When driven out of his walk, nothing could be more stupid or ignorant,
no∣thing more dejected or forlorn. But, we have a compleat history of a
dwarf, very accurately related by Mr. Danbenton, in his part of the Histoire
Naturel; which I will here take leave to translate.</P>
<P>This dwarf, whose name was Baby, was well known, having spent
the greatest part of his life <PB N="255" REF="273"/> at Lunenville, in the
palace of Stanislaus, the exiled king of Poland. He was born in the village
of Plaisne, in France, in the year 1741. His father and mother were
peasants, both of good constitutions, and inured to a life of hus∣bandry
and labour. Baby, when born, weighed but a pound and a quarter. We are not
informed of the dimensions of his body at that time; but we may conjecture
they were very small, as he was presented on a plate to be baptized, and
for a long time lay in a slipper. His mouth, although proportioned to the
rest of his body, was not, at that time, large enough to take in the nipple;
and he was, therefore, obliged to be suckled by a she-goat that was in the
house; and that served as a nurse, attending to his cries with a kind of
maternal fondness. He began to articulate some words when eighteen months
old; and at two years he was able to walk alone. He was then fitted with
shoes that were about an inch and a half long. He was attacked with several
acute disorders; but the small-pox was the only one which left any marks
behind it. Until he was six years old, he eat no other food but pulse,
potatoes, and bacon. His father and mother were, from their po∣verty, incapable
of affording him any better nourishment; and his education was little better 
<PB N="256" REF="274"/> than his food, being bred up among the rustics of the
place. At six years old he was about fifteen inches high; and his whole body
weigh∣ed but thirteen pound. Notwithstanding this, he was well proportioned,
and handsome; his health was good, but his understanding scarce
passed the bounds of instinct. It was at that time that the king of
Poland, having heard of such a curiosity, had him conveyed to Lunen∣ville,
gave him the name of Baby, and kept him in his palace.</P>
<P>Baby, having thus quitted the hard condition of a peasant to enjoy
all the comforts and the conveniencies of life, seemed to receive no
al∣teration from his new way of living, either in mind or person. He
preserved the good∣ness of his constitution till about the age of
sixteeen, but his body seemed to encrease very slowly during the whole
time; and his stupi∣dity was such, that all instructions were lost in
improving his understanding. He could never be brought to have any sense
of religion, nor even to shew the least signs of a reasoning fa∣culty.
They attempted to teach him dancing and music, but in vain; he never could
make any thing of music; and as for dancing, altho' he beat time tolerably
exact, yet he could never remember the figure, but while his dancing-master 
<PB N="257" REF="275"/> stood by to direct his motions. Not∣withstanding a
mind thus destitute of under∣standing, was not without its passions,
anger and jealousy harrassed it at times; nor was he without desires of
another nature.</P>
<P>At the age of sixteen, Baby was twenty-nine inches tall; at this
he rested; but having thus arrived at his acme, the alterations of puberty,
or rather, perhaps, of old age, came fast upon him. From being very
beautiful, the poor little creature now became quite de∣formed; his strength
quite forsook him; his back bone began to bend; his head hung for∣ward; his
legs grew weak; one of his shoul∣ders turned awry; and his nose grew
dispro∣portionably large. With his strength, his na∣tural spirits also
forsook him; and, by the time he was twenty, he was grown feeble, decrepid,
and marked with the strongest impressions of old age. It had been
before remarked by some, that he would die of old age before he arrived at
thirty; and, in fact, by the time he was twenty-two, he could scarcely walk
an hundred paces, being worn with the multi∣plicity of his years, and bent
under the burthen of protracted life. In this year he died; a cold, attended
with a slight fever, threw him into a kind of lethargy, which had a few
mo∣mentary <PB N="258" REF="276"/> intervals; but he could scarce be brought
to speak. However, it is asserted, that in the five last days of his
life, he shewed a clearer understanding, than in his times of best
health: but at length he died, after enduring great agonies, in the
twenty-second year of his age.</P>
<P>Opposite to this accidental diminution of the human race, is that
of its extraordinary mag∣nitude. Concerning the reality of a nation of Giants,
there have been many disputes among the learned. Some have affirmed the
proba∣bility of such a race; and others, as warmly have denied the
possibility of their existence. But it is not from any speculative
reasonings, upon a subject of this kind, that information is to be
obtained; it is not from the disputes of the scholar, but the labours of
the enterprizing, that we are to be instructed in this enquiry. Indeed,
nothing can be more absurd, than what some learned men have advanced upon
this subject. It is very unlikely, says Grew, that there should either be
dwarfs or giants; or if such, they cannot be fitted for the usual
enjoy∣ment of life and reason. Had man been born a dwarf, he could scarce
have been a reasonable creature; for to that end, he must have a jolt head,
and then he would not have body and blood enough to supply his brain with
spirits: <PB N="259" REF="277"/> or if he had a small head, proportionable
to his body, there would not be brain enough for con∣ducting life. But it is
still worse with giants; and there could never have been a nation of
such, for there would not be food enough found in any country to sustain
them; or if there were beasts sufficient for this purpose, there would
not be grass enough for their main∣tenance. But what is still more, add
others, giants could never be able to support the weight of their own bodies;
since a man of ten feet high, must be eight times as heavy as one of the
ordinary stature; whereas, he has but twice the size of muscles to
support such a burthen: and, consequently, would be overloaded with the
weight of his own body. Such are the the∣ories upon this subject; and they
require no other answer, but that experience proves them both to be false:
dwarfs are found capable of life and reason; and giants are seen to carry
their own bodies. We have several accounts from mariners, that a nation of
giants actually exists; and mere speculation should never in∣duce us to
doubt their veracity.</P>
<P>Ferdinand Magellan was the first who dis∣covered this race of
people along the coast, towards the extremity of South America. Ma∣gellan was
a Portuguese, of noble extraction, <PB N="260" REF="278"/> who having long
behaved with great bravery, under Albukerk, the conqueror of India, he was
treated with neglect by the court, upon his re∣turn. Applying, therefore, to
the king of Spain, he was entrusted with the command of five ships, to take
and subdue the Molucca islands; upon one of which he was slain. It was in
his voyage thither, that he happened to winter in St. Julian's Bay, an American
har∣bour, forty-nine degrees south of the line. In this desolate region,
where nothing was seen but objects of terror, where neither trees nor
ver∣dure drest the face of the country, they re∣mained for some months
without seeing any human creature. They had judged the country to be utterly
uninhabitable; when one day, they saw approaching, as if he had been dropt
from the clouds, a man of enormous stature, dancing and singing, and
putting dust upon his head, as they supposed, in token of peace. This
overture for friendship was, by Magellan's command, quickly answered by the
rest of his men; and the giant approaching, testified every mark of
astonishment and surprize. He was so tall, that the Spaniards only
reached his waist; his face was broad, his colour brown, and painted over
with a variety of tints; each cheek had the resemblance of an heart drawn
upon it; <PB N="261" REF="279"/> his hair was approaching to whiteness; he was
cloathed in skins, and armed with a bow. Being treated with kindness, and
dismissed with some trifling presents, he soon returned, with many
more of the same stature; two of whom the mariners decoyed on ship-board:
nothing could be more gentle than they were in the beginning; they considered
the fetters that were preparing for them, as ornaments, and played with them,
like children with their toys; but when they found for what purpose they were
intended, they instantly exerted their amazing strength, and broke them in
pieces with a very easy effort. This account, with a variety of other
circumstances, has been confirmed by succeed∣ing travellers: Herrera,
Sebald Wert, Oliver Van Noort, and James le Maire, all correspond in
affirming the fact, although they differ in many particulars of their
respective descriptions. The last voyager we have had, that has seen
this enormous race, is Commodore Byron. I have talked with the person who
first gave the relation of that voyage, and who was the car∣penter of the
Commodore's ship; he was a sen∣sible, understanding man, and I believe
ex∣tremely faithful. By him, therefore, I was assured, in the most
solemn manner, of the truth of his relation; and this account has since
been <PB N="262" REF="280"/> confirmed by one or two publications; in all which,
the particulars are pretty nearly the same. One of the circumstances which
most puzzled me to reconcile to probability, was that of the horses, on
which they are described as riding down to the shore. We know the American
horse to be of European breed; and, in some measure, to be degenerated
from the original. I was at a loss, therefore, to account how an horse of
not more than fourteen hands high, was capable of carrying a man of nine feet;
or, in other words, an animal almost as large as itself. But the wonder
will cease, when we consider, that so small a beast as an ass, will
carry a man of ordinary size tolerably well; and the proportion between this,
and the former instance, is tolerably exact. We can no longer, therefore,
refuse our assent to the exist∣ence of this gigantic race of mankind;
in what manner they are propagated, or under what re∣gulations they live, is a
subject that remains for future investigation. It should appear,
how∣ever, that they are a wandering nation, changing their abode with the
course of the sun, and shifting their situation, for the convenience of
food, climate, or pasture.</P>
<P>This race of giants are described as pos∣sessed of great
strength; and, no doubt, they <PB N="263" REF="281"/> must be very different
from those accidental giants that are to be seen in different parts of
Europe. Stature with these, seems rather their infirmity than their pride;
and adds to their burthen, without encreasing their strength. Of those I
have seen, the generality were ill-formed and unhealthful; weak in their
persons, or in∣capable of exerting what strength they were
possessed of. The same defects of understanding that attended
those of suppressed stature, were found in those who were thus
overgrown: they were heavy, phlegmatic, stupid, and inclined to sadness.
Their numbers, however, are but few; and it is thus kindly ordered by
Providence, that as the middle state is the best fitted for happiness,
so the middle ranks of mankind are produced in the greatest variety.</P>
<P>However, mankind seems naturally to have a respect for men of
extraordinary stature; and it has been a supposition of long standing,
that our ancestors were much taller, as well as much more beautiful than we.
This has been, in∣deed, a theme of poetical declamation from the beginning; and
man was scarce formed, when he began to deplore an imaginary decay. Nothing
is more natural than this progress of the mind, in looking up to antiquity
with reve∣rential wonder. Having been accustomed to <PB N="264" REF="282"/>
compare the wisdom of our fathers, with our own in early imbecillity, the
impression of their superiority remains when they no longer exist, and
when we cease to be inferior. Thus the men of every age consider the past
as wiser than the present; and the reverence seems to accu∣mulate as our
imaginations ascend. For this rea∣son, we allow remote antiquity many
advantages, without disputing their title: the inhabitants of uncivilized
countries represent them as taller and stronger; and the people of a more
polished nation, as more healthy and more wise. Ne∣vertheless, these
attributes seem to be only the prejudices of ingenuous minds; a kind of
gra∣titude, which we hope in turn to receive from posterity. The ordinary
stature of men, Mr. Derham observes, is, in all probability, the same now
as at the beginning. The oldest measure we have of the human figure, is in
the monument of Cheops, in the first pyramid of Egypt. This must have
subsisted many hundred years before the times of Homer, who is the
first that deplores the decay. This mo∣nument, however, scarce exceeds the
measure of our ordinary coffins: the cavity is no more than six feet long,
two feet wide, and deep in about the same proportion. Several mummies also,
of a very early age, are found to be only of the <PB N="265" REF="283"/>
ordinary stature; and shew that, for these three thousand years at
least, men have not suffered the least diminution. We have many
corrobo∣rating proofs of this, in the ancient pieces of armour which are dug up
in different parts of Europe. The brass helmet dug up at Medauro, fits one of
our men, and yet is allowed to have been left there at the overthrow of
Asdrubal. Some of our finest antique statues, which we learn from Pliny,
and others, to be exactly as big as the life, still continue to this day,
remain∣ing monuments of the superior excellence of their workmen indeed, but
not of the supe∣riority of their stature. We may conclude, therefore, that
men have been, in all ages, pretty much of the same size they are at
present; and that the only difference must have been accidental, or perhaps
national.</P>
<P>As to the superior beauty of our ancestors, it is not easy to
make the comparison; beauty seems a very uncertain charm; and frequently is
less in the object, than in the eye of the be∣holder. Were a modern lady's
face formed exactly like the Venus of Medicis, or the sleeping vestal,
she would scarce be considered beautiful, except by the lovers of
antiquity, whom, of all her admirers, perhaps, she would 
<PB N="266" REF="284"/> be least desirous of pleasing. It is true, that we
have some disorders among us that disfigure the features, and from which
the ancients were exempt; but it is equally so, that we want some which
were common among them, and which were equally deforming. As for their
intellectual powers, these also were probably the same as ours: we excel
them in the sciences, which may be considered as an history of
ac∣cumulated experience; and they excel us in the poetic arts, as they had the
first rifling of all the striking images of Nature.</P>

willing to lengthen out his ex∣istence by art; and although he cannot prevent
death, he tries to obviate his dissolution. It is natural to attempt to
preserve even the most trifling relicks of what has long given us
plea∣sure; nor does the mind separate from the body, without a wish, that
even the wretched heap of dust it leaves behind, may yet be re∣membered. The
embalming, practised in va∣rious nations, probably had its rise in this
fond desire: an urn filled with ashes, among the Ro∣mans, served as a
pledge of continuing af∣fection; and even the grassy graves in our own
church yards, are raised above the surface, with the desire that the body
below should not be wholly forgotten. The soul, ardent after eter∣nity for
itself, is willing to procure, even for the body, a prolonged
duration."</Q></P>
<P>But of all nations, the Egyptians carried this art to the highest
perfection: as it was a prin∣ciple <PB N="268" REF="286"/> of their religion, to
suppose the soul con∣tinued only coeval to the duration of the body, they
tried every art to extend the life of the one, by preventing the
dissolution of the other. In this practice they were exercised from the
earliest ages; and the mummies they have em∣balmed in this manner, continue
in great num∣bers to the present day. We are told, in Ge∣nesis, that
Joseph seeing his father expire, gave orders to his physicians to embalm
the body, which they executed in the compass of forty days, which was the
usual time of embalming. Herodotus also, the most ancient of the
pro∣phane historians, gives us a copious detail of this art, as it was
practised, in his time, among the Egyptians. There are certain men among
them, says he, who practise embalming as a trade; which they perform with
all expedition possible. In the first place, they draw out the brain
through the nostrils, with irons adapted to this purpose; and in proportion
as they eva∣cuate it in this manner, they fill up the cavity with aromatics:
they next cut open the belly, near the sides, with a sharpened stone, and
take out the entrails, which they cleanse, and wash in palm oil: having
performed this operation, they roll them in aromatic powder, fill them with
myrrh, cassia, and other perfumes, except <PB N="269" REF="287"/> incense;
and replace them, sewing up the body again. After these precautions, they
salt the body with nitre, and keep it in the salting-place for seventy
days, it not being permitted to pre∣serve it so any longer. When the
seventy days are accomplished, and the body washed once more, they
swathe it in bands made of linen, which have been dipt in a gum the Egyptians
use instead of salt. When the friends have taken back the body, they make
an hollow trough, something like the shape of a man, in which they place
the body; and this they in∣close in a box, preserving the whole as a most
precious relick, placed against the wall. Such are the ceremonies used with
regard to the rich; as for those who are contented with an humbler
preparation, they treat them as follows: they fill a syringe with an
odoriferous liquor ex∣tracted from the cedar tree, and, without mak∣ing any
incision, inject it up the body of the deceased, and then keep it in nitre,
as long as in the former case. When the time is expired, they evacuate the
body of the cedar liquor which had been injected; and such is the effect of
this operation, that the liquor dissolves the intestines, and brings them
away: the nitre also, serves to eat away the flesh; and leaves only the
skin and the bones remaining. This <PB N="270" REF="288"/> done, the body is
returned to the friends, and the embalmer takes no farther trouble about it.
The third method of embalming those of the meanest condition, is merely by
purging and cleansing the intestines by frequent in∣jections, and
preserving the body for a similar term in nitre, at the end of which it is
restored to the relations.</P>
<P>Diodorus Siculus also, makes mention of the manner in which
these embalmings are per∣formed. According to him, there were several
officers appointed for this purpose: the first of them, who was called the
scribe, marked those parts of the body, on the left side, which were to
be opened; the cutter made the incision; and one of those that were to
salt it, drew out all the bowels, except the heart and the kidnies; another
washed them in palm-wine, and odo∣riferous liquors; afterwards, they anointed
for above thirty days, with cedar, gum, myrrh, cinnamon, and other perfumes.
These aro∣matics preserved the body entire for a long time, and gave it a
very agreeable odour. It was not in the least disfigured by this
pre∣paration; after which it was returned to the relations, who kept it in a
coffin, plac'd up∣right against the wall.</P>
<P>Most of the modern writers who have treated <PB N="271" REF="289"/>
on this subject, have merely repeated what has been said by Herodotus; and
if they add any thing of their own, it is but merely from con∣jecture. Dumont
observes, that it is very pro∣bable, that aloes, bitumen, and cinnamon, make
a principal part of the composition which is used on this occasion: he
adds, that after embalming, the body is put into a coffin, made of the
sycamore-tree, which is almost in∣corruptible. Mr. Grew remarks, that in an
Egyptian mummy, in the possession of the Royal Society, the preparation
was so pene∣trating, as to enter into the very substance of the bones,
and rendered them so black, that they seemed to have been burnt. From this
he is induced to believe, that the Egyptians had a custom of embalming their
dead, by boil∣ing them in a kind of liquid preparation, until all the aqueous
parts of the body were exhaled away; and until the oily or gummy matter had
penetrated throughout. He proposes, in con∣sequence of this, a method of
macerating, and afterwards of boiling the dead body in oil of walnut.</P>
<P>I am, for my own part, of opinion, that there were several ways of
preserving dead bodies from putrefaction; and that this would be no difficult
matter, since different nations have all <PB N="272" REF="290"/> succeeded
in the attempt. We have an ex∣ample of this kind among the Guanches, the
ancient inhabitants of the island of Teneriff. Those who survived the
general destruction of this people, by the Spaniards, when they con∣quered
this island, informed them, that the art of embalming was still preserved
there; and that there was a tribe of priests among them, possessed of
the secret, which they kept con∣cealed as a sacred mystery. As the
greatest part of the nation was destroyed, the Spaniards could not arrive
at a complete knowledge of this art; they only found out a few of the
par∣ticulars. Having taken out the bowels, they washed the body several
times in a lee, made of the dried bark of the pine-tree, warmed, during the
summer, by the sun, or by a stove in the winter. They afterwards anointed
it with but∣ter, or the fat of bears, which they had pre∣viously boiled with
odoriferous herbs, such as sage and lavender. After this unction, they
suffered the body to dry; and then repeated the operation, as often as it was
necessary, until the whole substance was impregnated with the
pre∣paration. When it was become very light, it was then a certain sign that
it was fit, and pro∣perly prepared. They then rolled it up in the dried skins
of goats; which, when they had a <PB N="273" REF="291"/> mind to save expence,
they suffered to remain with the hair still growing upon them. Pur∣chas
assures us, that he has seen mummies of this kind in London; and mentions
the name of a gentleman who had seen several of them in the island of
Teneriff, which were supposed to have been two thousand years old; but
without any certain proofs of such great anti∣quity. This people, who
probably came first from the coasts of Africa, might have learned this art
from the Egyptians, as there was a traffic carried on from thence into the
most in∣ternal parts of Africa.</P>
<P>Father Acosta, and Garcilasso de la Vega, make no doubt but
that the Peruvians under∣stood the art of preserving their dead for a very
long space of time. They assert their having seen the bodies of
several Incas, that were per∣fectly preserved. They still preserved
their hair, and their eye-brows; but they had eyes, made of gold, put in the
places of those taken out. They were cloathed in their usual habits, and
seated in the manner of the Indians, their arms placed on their breasts.
Garcilasso touched one of their fingers, and found it ap∣parently as hard
as wood; and the whole body was not heavy enough to over-burthen a weak man,
who should attempt to carry it away. <PB N="274" REF="292"/> Acosta
presumes, that these bodies were em∣balmed with a bitumen, of which the
Indians knew the properties. Garcilasso, however, is of a different
opinion, as he saw nothing bitu∣minous about them; but he confesses, that
he did not examine them very particularly; and he regrets his not having
enquired into the methods used for that purpose. He adds that, being a
Peruvian, his countrymen would not have scrupled to inform him of the
secret, if they really had it still among them.</P>
<P>Garcilasso, thus being ignorant of the secret, makes use of
some inductions, to throw light upon the subject; he asserts, that the
air is so dry and so cold at Cusco, that flesh dries there like wood,
without corrupting: and he is of opinion, that they dried the body in snow,
be∣fore they applied the bitumen: he adds, that in the times of the Incas, they
usually dried the flesh which was designed for the ammunition of the
army; and that when they had lost their humidity, they might be kept without
salt, or any other preparation.</P>
<P>It is said, that at Spitsbergen, which lies within the artic
circle, and, consequently, in the coldest climate, bodies never corrupt,
nor suffer any apparent alteration, even though buried for thirty years:
nothing corrupts or putrifies <PB N="275" REF="293"/> in that climate; the wood
which has been em∣ployed in building those houses where the train-oil is
separated, appears as fresh as the day they were first cut.</P>
<P>If excessive cold, therefore, be thus ca∣pable of preserving
bodies from corruption, it is not less certain, that a great degree of
dry∣ness, produced by heat, produces the same effect. It is well known,
that the men and animals that are buried in the sands of Arabia, quickly dry
up, and continue in preservation for several ages, as if they had been
actually em∣balmed. It has often happened, that whole caravans have perished
in crossing those deserts, either by the burning winds that infest
them, or by the sands which are raised by the tempest, and overwhelm
every creature in certain ruin. The bodies of those persons are preserved
en∣tire; and they are often found in this condition by some accidental
passenger. Many authors, both ancient and modern, make mention of such
mummies as these; and Shaw says, that he has been assured, that numbers
of men, as well as other animals, have been thus preserved, for times
immemorial, in the burning sands of Saibah, which is a place, he
supposes, situate between Rasem and Egypt.</P>
<P>The corruption of dead bodies, being en∣tirely <PB N="276" REF="294"/> caused by the fermentation of the hu∣mours, whatever is capable of
hindering or re∣tarding this fermentation, will contribute to their
preservation. Both heat and cold, though so contrary in themselves,
produce similar ef∣fects in this particular, by drying up the hu∣mours. The
cold in condensing and thickening them, and the heat in evaporating them
be∣fore they have time to act upon the solids. But it is necessary that
these extremes should be constant; for if they succeed each other so
as that cold shall follow heat, or dryness humi∣dity, it must then
necessarily happen, that cor∣ruption must ensue. However, in temperate
climates, there are natural causes capable of preserving dead bodies; among
which we may reckon the qualities of the earth in which they are buried. If the
earth be drying and astrin∣gent, it will imbibe the humidity of the body; and
it may be probably for this reason that the bodies buried in the monastery
of the Cor∣deliers, at Thoulouse, do not putrify, but dry in such a manner
that one may lift them up by one arm.</P>
<P>The gums, resins, and bitumens, with which dead bodies are
embalmed, keep off the impres∣sions which they would else receive from
the al∣teration of the temperature of the air; and still 
<PB N="277" REF="295"/> more, if a body thus prepared be placed in a dry or
burning sand, the most powerful means will be united for its
preservation. We are not to be surprized, therefore, at what we are told by
Chardin, of the county of Chorosan, in Persia. The bodies which have been
previously embalmed, and buried in the sands of that country, as he
assures us, are found to petrify, or, in other words, to become extremely
hard, and are preserved for several ages. It is as∣serted that some
of them have continued for a thousand years.</P>
<P>The Egyptians, as has been mentioned above, swathed the body with
linen bands, and enclosed it in a coffin; however, it is pro∣bable that, with
all these precautions, they would not have continued till now, if the tombs,
or pits, in which they were placed, had not been dug in a dry chalky soil,
which was not susceptible of humidity; and which was, be∣sides, covered
over with a dry sand of several feet thickness.</P>
<P>The sepulchres of the ancient Egyptians sub∣sist to this
day. Most travellers who have been in Egypt, have described those of
ancient mummies, and have seen the mummies interred there. These catacombs
are within two leagues of the ruins of this city, nine leagues from 
<PB N="278" REF="296"/> Grand Cairo, and about two miles from the vil∣lage of
Zaccara. They extend from thence to the Pyramids of Pharaoh, which are about
eight miles distant. These sepulchres lie in a field, covered with a fine
running sand, of a yellowish colour. The country is dry and hilly; the
entrance of the tomb is choaked up with sand; there are many open, but
several more that are still concealed. The inhabitants of the neighbouring
village have no other com∣merce, or method of subsisting, but by
seeking out mummies, and selling them to such stran∣gers as happen to
be at Grand Cairo. 
<Q REND="inline">"This commerce, some years ago, was not only a
very common, but a very gainful one. A complete mummy was often sold for
twenty pounds: but it must not be supposed that it was bought at such
an high price from a mere passion for an∣tiquity; there were much more
powerful mo∣tives for this traffic. Mummy at that time made a considerable
article in medicine; and a thousand imaginary virtues were ascribed to it,
for the cure of most disorders, particularly of the paralytic kind. There
was no shop, therefore, without mummy in it; and no physician thought he
had properly treated his patient, without adding this to his prescription.
In∣duced by the general repute, in which this sup∣posed 
<PB N="279" REF="297"/> drug was at that time, several Jews, both of Italy and
France, found out the art of imi∣tating mummy so exactly, that they, for a
long time, deceived all Europe. This they did by drying dead bodies in ovens,
after having prepared them with myrrh, aloes, and bitumen. Still, however, the
request for mummies con∣tinued, and a variety of cures were daily ascribed
to them. At length, Paraeus wrote a treatise on their total inefficacy in
physic; and shewed their abuse in loading the stomach, to the
exclusion of more efficacious medicines. From that time, therefore, their
reputation began to decline; the Jews discontinued their counterfeits, and
the trade returned entire to the Egyptians, when it was of no longer value. The
industry of seeking after mummies is now totally relaxed, their price
merely arbitrary, and just what the curious are willing to give."</Q></P>
<P>In seeking for mummies, they first clear away the sand, which
they may do for weeks together, without finding what they want. Upon coming to
a little square opening, of about eighteen feet in depth, they descend into
it, by holes for the feet, placed at proper in∣tervals; and there they are
sure of finding what they seek for. These caves, or wells, as they call
them there, are hollowed out of a white <PB N="280" REF="298"/> free-stone,
which is found in all this country a few feet below the covering of sand.
When one gets to the bottom of these, which are sometimes forty feet below
the surface, there are several square openings, on each side, into
passages of ten or fifteen feet wide, and these lead to chambers of
fifteen or twenty feet square. These are all hewn out into the rock; and in
each of the catacombs are to be found several of these apartments,
communicating with each other. They extend a great way under ground, so as to
be under the city of Memphis, and in a manner to undermine its environs.</P>
<P>In some of the chambers, the walls are adorned with figures and
hieroglyphics; in others, the mummies are found in tombs, round the apartment
hollowed out in the rock. These tombs are upright, and cut into the shape
of a man, with his arms stretched out. There are still others found, and
these in the greatest num∣ber, in wooden coffins, or in cloaths covered
with bitumen. These coffins, or wrappers, are all over covered with a variety
of ornaments. There are some of them painted, and are adorned with figures,
such as that of death, and the leaden seals, on which several characters
are engraven. Some of these coffins are carved <PB N="281" REF="299"/> into
the human shape; but the head alone is distinguishable; the rest of the
body is all of a piece, and terminated by a pedestal, while there are some
with their arms hanging down; and it is by these marks that the bodies of
per∣sons of rank are distinguished from those of the meaner order.
These are generally found lying on the floor, without any profusion of
orna∣ments; and in some chambers the mummies are found indiscriminately
piled upon each other, and buried in the sand.</P>
<P>Many mummies are found lying on their backs; their heads turned to
the north, and the hands placed on the belly. The bands of linen, with which
these are swathed, are found to be more than a thousand yards long; and,
of consequence, the number of circumvolu∣tions they make about the body
must have been amazing. These were performed by beginning at the head, and
ending at the feet; but they contrived it so as to avoid covering the face.
However, when the face is entirely uncovered, it moulders into dust
immediately upon the admission of the air. When, therefore, it is
preserved entire, a slight covering of cloth is so disposed over it,
as that the shape of the eye, the nose, and the mouth, are seen under it.
Some mummies have been found with a long <PB N="282" REF="300"/> beard, and hair
that reached down to the mid-leg, nails of a surprizing length, and some
gilt, or at least painted of a gold colour. Some are found with bands upon
the breast, covered with hieroglyphics, in gold, silver, or in green; and
some with tutelary idols, and other figures of jasper, within their body. A
piece of gold, also, has often been found under their tongues, of about two
pistoles value; and, for this reason, the Arabians spoil all the mummies
they meet with, in order to get at the gold.</P>
<P>But, although art, or accident, has thus been found to preserve
dead bodies entire, it must by no means be supposed that it is capable of
preserving the exact form and lineaments of the deceased person. Those
bodies which are found dried away in the Desarts, or in some particular
church-yards, are totally deformed and scarce any lineaments remain of their
external structure. Nor are the mummies pre∣served by embalming, in a
better condition. The flesh is dried away, hardened, and hidden under a
variety of bandages; the bowels, as we have seen, are totally removed; and
from hence, in the most perfect of them, we see only a shapeless mass
of skin discoloured; and even the features scarce distinguishable.
The art is, therefore, an effort rather of preserving <PB N="283" REF="301"/>
the substance than the likeness of the deceased; and has,
consequently, not been brought to its highest pitch of perfection. It
appears from a mummy, not long since dug up in France, that the art of
embalming was more completely understood in the western world than even in
Egypt itself. This mummy, which was dug up at Auvergne, was an amazing
instance of their skill, and is one of the most curious reliques in the
art of preservation. As some peasants, in that part of the world, were
digging in a field near Rion, within about twenty-six paces of the highway,
between that and the river Artier, they discovered a tomb, that was about a
foot and a half beneath the surface. It was composed only of two stones;
one of which formed the body of the sepulchre, and the other the cover. This
tomb was of free-stone; seven feet and an half long, three feet and a half
broad, and about three feet high. It was of rude workmanship; the cover had
been polished, but was without figure or in∣scription: within this tomb was
placed a leaden coffin, four feet seven inches long, fourteen inches broad,
and fifteen high. It was not made coffin fashion, but oblong, like a box,
equally broad at both ends, and covered with a lid that fitted on like a
snuff-box, without <PB N="284" REF="302"/> an hinge. This cover had two holes
in it, each of about two inches long, and very narrow, filled with a
substance resembling butter; but for what purpose intended remains
unknown. Within this coffin was a mummy, in the highest and most perfect
preservation. The internal sides of the coffin were filled with an aromatic
substance, mingled with clay. Round the mummy was wrapped a coarse cloth,
in form of a napkin; under this were two shirts, or shrouds, of the most
exquisite texture; be∣neath these a bandage, which covered all parts of the
body, like an infant in swadling cloaths; still, under this general bandage
there was another, which went particularly round the extremities, the hands and
the legs. The head was covered with two caps; the feet and hands were without
any particular ban∣dages; and the whole body was covered with an aromatic
substance, an inch thick. When these were removed, and the body exposed
naked to view, nothing could be more asto∣nishing than the preservation
of the whole, and the exact resemblance it bore to a body that had but just
been dead a day or two before. It ap∣peared well proportioned, except that the
head was rather large, and the feet small. The skin had all the pliancy and
colour of a body lately <PB N="285" REF="303"/> dead; the visage, however, was
of a brownish hue. The belly yielded to the touch; all the joints were
flexible, except those of the legs and feet; the fingers stretched forth of
them∣selves when bent inwards. The nails still con∣tinued perfect; and all
the marks of the joints, both in the fingers, the palms of the hands, and the
soles of the feet, remained perfectly vi∣sible. The bones of the arms and
legs were soft and pliant; but, on the contrary, those of the skull
preserved their rigidity; the hair, which only covered the back of the head,
was of a chesnut colour, and about two inches long. The pericranum at top was
separated from the skull, by an incision, in order to open that for the
introducing proper aromatics in the place of the brain, where they were found
mixed with clay. The teeth, the tongue, and the ears, were all preserved in
perfect form. The intestines were not taken out of the body, but remained
pliant and entire, as in a fresh sub∣ject; and the breast was made to
rise and fall like a pair of bellows. The embalming pre∣paration had a very
strong and pungent smell, which the body preserved for more than a month
after it was exposed to the air. This odour was perceived whenever the mummy
was laid; although it remained there but a very <PB N="286" REF="304"/> short
time, it was even pretended that the pea∣sants of the neighbouring villages
were incom∣moded by it. If one touched either the mummy, or any part of the
preparation, the hands smelt of it for several hours after, although
washed with water, spirit of wine, or vinegar. This mummy, having remained
exposed for some months to the curiosity of the public, began to suffer
some mutilations. A part of the skin of the forehead was cut off; all its
teeth were drawn out, and some attempts were made to pull away the tongue. It
was, therefore, put into a glass-case, and shortly after transmitted to
the king of France's cabinet, at Paris.</P>
<P>There are many reasons to believe this to be the body of a
person of the highest distinction; however, no marks remain to assure
us either of the quality of the person, or the time of his decease. There
only are to be seen some irre∣gular figures on the coffin; one of which
repre∣sents a kind of star. There were also some sin∣gular characters
upon the bandages, which were totally defaced by those who had torn them
away. However, it should seem that it had remained for several ages in
this state, since the first years immediately succeeding the interment,
are usually those in which the body is most liable to decay. It appears
also to be a much <PB N="287" REF="305"/> more perfect method of embalming
than that of the Egyptians; as in this the flesh continues with its natural
elasticity and colour, the bowels remain entire, and the joints have almost
the pliancy which they had when the person was alive. Upon the whole, it is
probable that a much less tedious preparation than that used by the
Egyptians would have sufficed to keep the body from putrefaction; and that an
injection of petreoleum inwardly, and a layer of asphal∣tum without, would
have sufficed to have made a mummy; and it is remarkable that Auvergne, where
this was found, affords these two substances in sufficient plenty. This
art, therefore, might be brought to greater per∣fection than it has arrived at
hitherto, were the art worth preserving. But mankind have long since grown
wiser in this respect; and are con∣tented no longer to keep by them a
deformed carcass, which, instead of aiding their magni∣ficence, must only
serve to mortify their pride.</P>

<PB N="288" REF="306"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>LEAVING man, we now descend to the lower ranks of animated nature,
and prepare to examine the life, manners, and characters of these our humble
partners in the creation. But, in such a wonderful variety as is diffused
around us, where shall we begin. The num∣ber of beings endued with life as
well as we, seems, at first view, infinite. Not only the fo∣rest, the
waters, the air, teems with animals of various kinds; but almost every
vegetable, every leaf, has millions of minute inhabitants, each of which fill
up the circle of its allotted life, and some of which are found objects of
the greatest curiosity. In this seeming exube∣rance of animals, it is
natural enough for igno∣rance to lie down in hopeless uncertainty, and to
declare what requires labour to particularize to be utterly inscrutable. It
is otherwise how∣ever with the active and searching mind; no way
intimidated with the immense variety, it begins the task of numbering,
grouping and classing all the various kind that fall within its notice;
finds every day new relations between <PB N="289" REF="307"/> the several
parts of the creation, acquires the art of considering several at a time
under one point of view; and, at last, begins to find that the variety is
neither so great nor so inscrutable as was at first imagined. As in a
clear night, the number of the stars seems infinite; yet, if we
sedulously attend to each in its place, and regularly class them, they
will soon be found to diminish, and come within a very scanty
com∣putation.</P>
<P>Method, therefore, is one of the principal helps in natural
history, and without it very little progress can be made in this science.
It is by that alone we can hope to dissipate that glare, if I may so
express it, that arises from a multiplicity of objects at once presenting
themselves to the view. It is method that fixes the attention to one point,
and leads it, by slow and certain degrees, to leave no part of nature
unobserved.</P>
<P>All naturalists, therefore, have been very careful in adopting
some method of classing or grouping the several parts of nature; and
some have written books of natural history with no other view. These
methodical divi∣sions some have treated with contempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Buffon in his Introduction, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>, not
considering that books, in general, are written <PB N="290" REF="308"/> with
opposite views: some to be read, and some only to be occasionally
consulted. The methodists, in natural history, seem to be con∣tent with
the latter advantage; and have sa∣crificed to order alone, all the delights
of the subject, all the arts of heightening, awakening, or continuing
curiosity. But they certainly have the same use in science that a
dictionary has in language; but with this difference, that in a dictionary we
proceed from the name to the definition; in a system of natural history,
we proceed from the definition to find out the thing. Without the aid of
system, nature must still have lain undistinguished, like furniture
in a lumber room; every thing we wish for is there, indeed; but we know not
where to find it. If, for instance, in a morning excursion, I find a plant,
or an insect, the name of which I desire to learn; or, perhaps, am curious
to know whether already known; in this enquiry I can expect information only
from one of these systems, which, being couched in a methodical form,
quickly directs me to what I seek for. Thus we will suppose that our
enquirer has met with a spider, and that he has never seen such an
in∣sect before. He is taught by the writer of a system<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaeus.</BIBL></NOTE> to examine whether it has wings, and
<PB N="291" REF="309"/> he finds that it has none. He, therefore, is to look for
it among the wingless insects, or the Aptera, as he calls them; he then is
to see whether the head and breast make one part of the body, or are
disunited: he finds they make one: he is then to reckon the number of feet
and eyes, and he finds that it has eight of each. The insect, therefore,
must be either a scorpion or a spider; but he lastly examines its
feelers, which he finds clavated, or clubbed; and, by all these marks, he at
last discovers it to be a spider. Of spiders, there are forty-seven
sorts; and, by reading the description of each, the enquirer will learn the
name of that which he desires to know. With the name of the insect, he is
also directed to those authors that have given any account of it, and the
page where that account is to be found; by this means he may know at once what
has been said of that animal by others, and what there is of novelty in the
result of his own re∣searches.</P>
<P>From hence, therefore, it will appear how useful those
systems in natural history are to the enquirer; but, having given them
all their merit, it would be wrong not to observe, that they have in general
been very much abused. Their authors, in general, seem to think that 
<PB N="292" REF="310"/> they are improvers of natural history, when in reality
they are but guides; they seem to boast that they are adding to our
knowledge, while they are only arranging it. These authors also, seem to
think that the reading of their works and systems, is the best method to
attain a knowledge of nature; but, setting aside the im∣possibility of
getting through whole volumes of a dry long catalogue, the multiplicity of
whose contents is too great for even the strongest me∣mory; such works
rather tell us the names than the history of the creature we desire to
en∣quire after. In these dreary pages, every in∣sect, or plant, that has a
name, makes as di∣stinguished a figure as the most wonderful, or the
most useful. The true end of studying nature is to make a just
selection, to find those parts of it that most conduce to our pleasure
or convenience, and to leave the rest in greater neglect. But these
systems, employing the same degree of attention upon all, give us no
opportunities of knowing which most deserves attention; and he who has made
his know∣ledge from such systems only, has his memory crouded with a
number of trifling, or minute particulars, which it should be his
business and his labour to forget. These books, as was said before, are
useful to be consulted, but they are <PB N="293" REF="311"/> very
unnecessary to be read; no enquirer in nature should be without one of
them; and without any doubt Linnaeus deserves the pre∣ference.</P>
<P>One fault more, in almost all these systematic writers, and
that which leads me to the subject of the present chapter, is, that
seeing the ne∣cessity of methodical distribution in some parts of
nature, they have introduced it into all. Finding the utility of arranging
plants, birds, or insects, they have arranged quadrupedes also with the
same assiduity; and although the num∣ber of these is so few as not to
reach two hundred, they have darkened the subject with distinctions and
divisions, which only serve to puzzle and perplex. All method is only
use∣ful in giving perspicuity, where the subject is either dark or
copious: but with regard to qua∣drupedes, the number is but few; many of them
we are well acquainted with by habit; and the rest may very readily be known,
without any method. In treating of such, therefore, it would be useless
to confound the reader with a multiplicity of divisions; as quadrupedes are
conspicuous enough to obtain the second rank in nature, it becomes us to be
acquainted with, at least, the names of them all. However, as there are
naturalists who have gained a name <PB N="294" REF="312"/> from the excellence
of their methods, in classing these animals, some readers may desire
to have a knowledge of what has been laboriously in∣vented for their
instruction. I will just take leave, therefore, to mention the most
applauded methods of classing animals, as adopted by Ray, Klein, and
Linnaeus; for it often happens, that the terms which have been long used in a
science, though frivolous, become, by prescrip∣tion, a part of the
science itself.</P>
<P>Ray, after Aristotle, divides all animals into two kinds; those
which have blood, and those which are bloodless. In the last class, he
places all the insect tribes. The former he di∣vides into such as breathe
through the lungs, and such as breathe through gills: these last
comprehend the fishes. In those which breathe through the lungs, some
have the heart com∣posed of two ventricles, and some have it of one. Of the
last are all animals of the cetaceous kind, all oviparous quadrupedes, and
serpents. Of those that have two ventricles, some are oviparous, which
are the birds; and some vivi∣parous, which are quadrupedes. The quadru∣pedes
he divides into such as have an hoof, and such as are claw-footed. Those
with the hoof, he divides into such as have it undivided, such as have it
cloven, and such as have the <PB N="295" REF="313"/> hoof divided into more
parts, as the rhinoceros, and hippopotamos. Animals with the cloven hoof, he
divides into such as chew the cud, such as the cow, and the sheep; and
such as are not ruminant, as the hog. He divides those ani∣mals that chew
the cud, into four kinds: the first have hollow horns, which they never
shed, as the cow; the second is of a less species, and is of the
sheep kind; the third is of the goat kind; and the last, which have solid
horns, and shed them annually, are of the deer kind. Coming to the
claw-footed animals, he finds some with large claws, resembling the fingers
of the human hand; and these he makes the ape kind. Of the others, some
have the foot divided in two, and have a claw to each division; these are
the camel kind. The ele∣phant makes a kind by itself, as its claws are
covered over by a skin. The rest of the nume∣rous tribe of claw-footed
animals, he divides into two kinds; the analogous, or such as re∣semble
each other; and the anomalous, which differ from the rest. The analogous
claw-footed animals, are of two kinds: they have more than two cutting teeth in
each jaw, such as the lion and the dog, which are carnivorous; or they have
but two cutting teeth in each jaw; and these are chiefly fed upon vegetables.
<PB N="296" REF="314"/> The carnivorous kinds are divided into the great and the
little. The great carnivorous animals are divided into such as have a short
snout, as the cat and the lion; and such as have it long and pointed, as
the dog and the wolf. The little claw-footed carnivorous ani∣mals, differ from
the great, in having a pro∣portionably smaller head, and a slender body,
that fits them for creeping into holes, in pur∣suit of their prey, like
worms; and they are therefore called the vermin kind.</P>
<P>We see, from this sketch of division and sub∣division, how
a subject, extremely delightful and amusing in itself, may be darkened,
and ren∣dered disgusting. But, notwithstanding, Ray seems to be one of
the most simple distributors; and his method is still, and not without
reason, adopted by many. Such as have been at the trouble to learn this
method, will certainly find it useful; nor would we be thought, in the
least, to take from its merits; all we contend for is, that the same
information may be ob∣tained by a pleasanter and an easier method.</P>
<P>It was the great success of Ray's method, that soon after
produced such a variety of at∣tempts in the same manner; but almost all
less simple, and more obscure. Mr. Klein's me∣thod is briefly as follows:
he makes the power <PB N="297" REF="315"/> of changing place, the
characteristic mark of animals in general; and he takes their di∣stinctions
from their aptitude and fitness for such a change. Some change place by
means of feet, or some similar contrivance; others have wings and feet:
some can change place only in water, and have only fins; some go upon
earth, without any feet at all: some change place, by moving their shell;
and some move only at a certain time of the year. Of such, however, as do
not move at all, he takes no notice. The quadrupedes that move chiefly by means
of four feet upon land, he divides into two orders. The first are the hoofed
kind; and the second, the claw kind. Each of these orders is divided into
four fa∣milies. The first family of the hoofed kind, are the single hoofed,
such as the horse, ass, &amp;c. The second family are such as have
the hoof cloven into two parts, such as the cow, &amp;c. The third family
have the hoof divided into three parts; and in this family is found only the
rhinoceros. The fourth family have the hoof divided into five parts; and in
this is only to be found the elephant. With respect to the clawed kind, the
first family comprehends those that have but two claws on each foot, as the
camel; the second family have three claws; <PB N="298" REF="316"/> the third,
four; and the fourth, five. This me∣thod of taking the distinctions of
animals from the organs of motion, is ingenious; but it is, at the same time,
incomplete: and, besides, the divisions into which it must
necessarily fall, is inadequate; since, for instance, in his family
with two claws, there is but one animal; whereas, in his family with five
claws, there are above an hundred.</P>
<P>Brisson, who has laboured this subject with great accuracy,
divides animated nature into nine classes: namely, quadrupedes; cetaceous
animals, or those of the whale kind; birds; rep∣tiles, or those of the
serpent kind; cartilaginous fishes; spinous fishes; shelled animals;
insects; and worms. He divides the quadrupedes into eighteen orders; and
takes their distinctions, from the number and form of their teeth.</P>
<P>But of all those whose systems have been adopted and
admired, Linnaeus is the foremost; as, with a studied brevity, his
system compre∣hends the greatest variety, in the smallest
space.</P>
<P>According to him, the first distinction of animals is to be
taken from their internal structure. Some have the heart with two
ven∣tricles, and hot red blood: namely, quadrupedes and birds. The quadrupedes
are viviparous, and the birds oviparous.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="317"/>Some have the heart with but one ventricle,
and cold red blood; namely, amphibia and fishes. The amphibia are furnished
with lungs; the fishes, with gills.</P>
<P>Some have the heart with one ventricle, and cold white serum;
namely, insects and worms: the insects have feelers; and the worms,
holders.</P>
<P>The distinctions of quadrupedes, or animals with paps, as he calls
them, are taken from their teeth. He divides them into seven or∣ders; to
which he gives names that are not easy of translation: Primates, or
principals, with four cutting teeth in each jaw; Bruta, or brutes, with no
cutting teeth; Ferae, or wild beasts, with generally six cutting teeth in
each jaw; Glires, or dormice, with two cutting teeth, both above and below;
Pecora, or cattle, with many cutting teeth above, and none below; Belluae, or
beasts, with the fore teeth blunt; Cete, or those of the whale kind, with
cartilaginous teeth. I have but just sketched out this system, as
being, in its own nature, the closest abridgment; it would take volumes to
dilate it to its proper length. The names of the differ∣ent animals, and their
classes, alone makes two thick octavo volumes; and yet nothing is given but
the slightest description of each. I <PB N="300" REF="318"/> have omitted
all criticism also, upon the ac∣curacy of the preceding systems: this
has been done both by Buffon and Daubenton, not with less truth than humour,
for they had too much good sense not to see the absurdity of
multi∣plying the terms of science to no end, and dis∣appointing our
curiosity rather with a catalogue of nature's varieties than an history of
nature.</P>
<P>Instead, therefore, of taxing the memory and teizing the patience
with such a variety of di∣visions and subdivisions, I will take leave
to class the productions of nature in the most ob∣vious, though not in the
most accurate man∣ner. In natural history, of all other sciences, there
is the least danger of obscurity. In morals, or in metaphysics, every
definition must be precise, because those sciences are built upon
definitions; but it is otherwise in those subjects where the exhibition
of the object itself is always capable of correcting the error. Thus it may
often happen that in a lax system of natural history, a creature may be
ranked among quadrupedes that belongs more pro∣perly to the fish or the
insect classes. But that can produce very little confusion, and every
reader can thus make a system the most agree∣able to his own imagination.
It will be of no manner of consequence whether we call a bird 
<PB N="301" REF="319"/> or an insect a quadrupede, if we are careful in
marking all its distinctions: the uncertainty in reasoning, or thinking,
that these approxima∣tions of the different kinds of animals produce, is but
very small, and happens but very rarely; whereas the labour that
naturalists have been at to keep the kinds asunder, had been excessive.
This, in general, has given birth to that va∣riety of systems which we have
just mentioned, each of which seems to be almost as good as the
preceding.</P>
<P>Taking, therefore, this latitude, and using method only where it
contributes to concise∣ness or perspicuity, we shall divide animated
nature into four classes; namely, quadrupedes, birds, fishes, and
insects. All these seem in general pretty well distinguished from
each other by nature; yet there are several instances in which we can
scarce tell whether it is a bird or a quadrupede that we are about to
examine; whether it is a fish or an insect that offers to our curiosity.
Nature is varied by impercep∣tible gradations, so that no line can be drawn
between any two classes of its productions, and no definition made to
comprehend them all. However, the distinctions between these classes
are sufficiently marked in general; and their encroachments upon each other
are so rare, that <PB N="302" REF="320"/> it will be sufficient particularly
to apprize the reader when they happen to be blended.</P>
<P>There are many quadrupedes that we are well acquainted with; and of
those we do not know we shall form the most clear and distinct
conceptions, by being told wherein they differ, and wherein they resemble
those with which we are familiar. Each class of qua∣drupedes may be ranged
under some one of the domestic kinds, that may serve for the mo∣del by
which we are to form some kind of idea of the rest. Thus we may say that
a tiger is of the cat kind, a wolf of the dog kind, be∣cause there are some
rude resemblances between each; and a person who has never seen the wild
animals will have some incomplete knowledge of their figure from the tame
ones. On the contrary, I will not, as some systematic writers have
done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Syst.</BIBL></NOTE>, say that a
bat is of the human kind, or an hog of the horse kind, merely because there
is some resemblance in their teeth, or their paps. For, although this
resemblance may be striking enough, yet a person who has never seen a
bat or a hog, will never form any just conception of either, by being told of
this minute similitude. In short, the method in classing quadrupedes
should be taken from their <PB N="303" REF="321"/> most striking
resemblances; and where these resemblances do not offer, we should not
force the similitude, but leave the animal to be de∣scribed as a solitary
species, by itself. The number of quadrupedes, is so few that, indeed,
without any method whatsoever, there is no great, danger of confusion.</P>
<P>All quadrupedes, the number of which, ac∣cording to Buffon, amounts
to but two hundred, may be classed in the following manner.</P>
<P>First, those of the Horse kind. This class contains the
Horse, the Ass, and the Zebra. Of these, none have horns; and their hoof
is of one solid piece.</P>
<P>The second class are those of the Cow kind; comprehending the
Urus, the Buffalo, the Bi∣son, and the Bonassas. These have cloven
hoofs, and chew the cud.</P>
<P>The third class is that of the Sheep kind; with cloven hoofs, and
chewing the cud, like the former. In this is comprehended the Sheep, the Goat,
the Lama, the Vigogne, the Gazella, the Guinea deer, and all of a similar
form.</P>
<P>The fourth class is that of the Deer kind, with cloven hoofs, and
with solid horns, that are shed every year. This class contains the Elk,
the Rein-deer, the Stag, the Buck, the Roe-buck, and the Axis.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="322"/>The fifth class comprehends all those of
the Hog kind, the Pecari, and the Bayberroussa.</P>
<P>The sixth class is that numerous one of the Cat kind. This
comprehends the Cat, the Lion, the Panther, the Leopard, the Jaguar, the
Cou∣gar, the Jaguarette, the Lynx, the Ounce, and the Catamountain. These are
all carnivorous, and furnished with crooked claws, which they can sheath
and unsheath at pleasure.</P>
<P>The seventh class is that of the Dog kind, carnivorous, and
furnished with claws like the former, but which they cannot sheath. This
class comprehends the Dog, the Wolf, the Fox, the Jackall, the Isatis, the
Hyena, the Civette, the Gibet, and the Genet.</P>
<P>The eighth class is that of the Weasil kind, with a long small
body, with five toes, or claws, on each foot; the first of them separated
from the rest like a thumb. This comprehends the Weasil, the Martin, the
Pole-cat, the Ferrit, the Mangoust, the Vansire, the Ermin, with all the
varieties of the American Moufettes.</P>
<P>The ninth class is that of the Rabbit kind, with two large cutting
teeth in each jaw. This comprehends the Rabbit, the Hare, the Guinea-pig, all
the various species of the Squirrel, the Dormouse, the Marrnotte, the Rat,
the Mouse, Agouti, the Paca, the Aperea, and the Tapeti.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="323"/>The tenth class is that of the Hedge-hog
kind, with claw feet, and covered with prickles, comprehending the Hedge-hog
and the Porcu∣pine, the Couendou, and the Urson.</P>
<P>The eleventh class is that of the Tortoise kind, covered with a
shell, or scales. This comprehends the Tortoise; the Pangolin, and the
Phataguin.</P>
<P>The twelfth is if the Otter, or amphibious kind, comprehending the
Otter, the Beaver, the Desman, the Morse, and the Seal.</P>
<P>The thirteenth class is that of the Ape and Monkey kinds, with
hands, and feet resembling hinds.</P>
<P>The fifteenth class is that of winged qua∣drupedes, or the Bat
kind, containing the Bat, the Flying Squirrel, and some other varieties.</P>
<P>The animals which seem to approach no other kind, either in
nature, or in form, but to make each a distinct species in itself, are
the following: the Elephant, the Rhinoceros, the Hippopotamos, the Camelopard,
the Camel, the Bear, the Badger, the Tapir, the Cabiai, the Coati, the Antbear,
the Tatou, and lastly the Sloth.</P>
<P>All other quadrupedes, whose names are not set down, will be
found among some of the above-mentioned classes, and referred to that 
<PB N="306" REF="324"/> which they most resemble. When, therefore, we are at
a loss to know the name of any par∣ticular animal, by examining which of the
known kinds it most resembles, either in shape, or in hoofs, or claws;
and then, examining the particular description, we shall be able to
discover not only its name, but its history. I have already said that all
methods of this kind are merely arbitrary, and that nature makes no exact
distinction between her productions. It is hard, for instance, to tell
whether we ought to refer the Civet to the dog, or the cat kind; but, if we
know the exact history of the civet, it is no great matter to which kind we
shall judge it to bear the greatest resemblance. It is enough that a
distribution of this kind ex∣cites in us some rude out-lines of the make,
or some marked similitudes in the nature of these animals; but, to know
them with any precision, no system, or even description will serve,
since the animal itself, or a good print of it, must be seen, and its
history be read at length, be∣fore it can be said to be known. To pretend
to say that we have an idea of a quadrupede, because we can tell the
number, or the make of its teeth, or its paps, is as absurd as if we should
pretend to distinguish men by the but∣tons on their cloaths. Indeed it
often happens <PB N="307" REF="325"/> that the quadrupede itself can be but
seldom seen; that many of the more rare kinds do not come into Europe above
once an age, and some of them have never been able to bear the re∣moval; in
such a case, therefore, there is no other substitute but a good print
of the animal to give an idea of its figure; for no description whatsoever
can answer this purpose so well. Mr. Locke, with his usual good
sense, has ob∣served, that a drawing of the animal, taken from the life,
is one of the best methods of advancing natural history; and yet, most of
our modern sy∣stematic writers are content rather with de∣scribing.
Descriptions, no doubt, will go some way towards giving an idea of the
figure of an animal; but they are certainly much the longest way about, and,
as they are usually managed, much the most obscure. In a drawing we can,
at a single glance, gather more instruction than by a day's painful
investigation of me∣thodical systems, where we are told the pro∣portions
with great exactness, and yet remain ignorant of the totality. In fact, this
method of describing all things is a fault that has in∣fected many of our
books, that treat on the meaner arts for this last age. They attempt to teach
by words what is only to be learnt by practice and inspection. Most of our
dictio∣naries, <PB N="308" REF="326"/> and bodies of arts and sciences, are
guilty of this error. Suppose, for instance, it be requisite to mention
the manner of making shoes, it is plain that all the verbal instructions in
the world will never give an adequate idea of this humble art, or teach a man
to become a shoe-maker. A day or two in a shoe-maker's shop will answer
the end better than a whole folio of instruction, which only serves to
op∣press the learner with the weight of its pre∣tended importance. We have
lately seen a la∣borious work carried on at Paris, with this only intent of
teaching all the trades by de∣scription; however, the design at first
blush seems to be ill considered; and it is pro∣bable that very few
advantages will be derived from so laborious an undertaking. With regard to
the descriptions in natural history, these, without all question, under
the direction of good sense, are necessary; but still they should
be kept within proper bounds; and, where a thing may be much more easily
shewn than described, the exhibition should ever pre∣cede the
account.</P>

<PB N="309" REF="327"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of Quadrupedes in general compared to Man.</HEAD>
<P>UPON comparing the various animals of the globe with each other, we
shall find that Qua∣drupedes demand the rank immediately next ourselves;
and, consequently, come first in con∣sideration. The similitude between
the struc∣ture of their bodies and ours, those instincts which they enjoy
in a superior degree to the rest, their constant services, or their
unceasing hostilities, all render them the foremost objects of our
curiosity, the most interesting parts of animated nature. These,
however, although now so completely subdued, very probably, in the
beginning, were nearer upon an equality with us, and disputed the
possession of earth. Man, while yet savage himself, was but ill
qua∣lified to civilize the forest. While yet naked, un∣armed, and without
shelter, every wild beast was a formidable rival; and the destruction of
such was the first employment of heroes. But, when he began to multiply,
and arts to accumulate, he soon cleared the plains of the most noxious of
these his rivals; a part was taken under his protection and care, while the
rest found a pre∣carious <PB N="310" REF="328"/> refuge in the burning defart,
or the howling wilderness.</P>
<P>From being rivals, quadrupedes have now become the assistants
of man; upon them he devolves the most laborious employments, and finds in
them patient and humble coad∣jutors, ready to obey, and content with the
smallest retribution. It was not, however, without long and repeated
efforts that the in∣dependant spirit of these animals was broken; for the
savage freedom, in wild animals, is ge∣nerally found to pass down through
several ge∣nerations before it is totally subdued. Those cats and dogs
that are taken from a state of na∣tural wildness in the forest, still
transmit their fierceness to their young: and, however con∣cealed in
general, it breaks out upon several occasions. Thus the assiduity and
application of man in bringing them up, not only alters their disposition,
but their very forms; and the difference between animals in a state of nature
and domestic tameness is so considerable, that Mr. Boffon has taken
this as a principal di∣stinction in classing them.</P>
<P>In taking a cursory view of the form of qua∣drupedes, we may
easily perceive that, of all the ranks of animated nature, they bear the
nearest resemblance to man. This similitude will be <PB N="311" REF="329"/> found more striking when, erecting themselves on their hinder
feet, they are taught to walk forward in an upright posture. We then see
that all their extremities in a manner corre∣spond with ours, and present
us with a rude imitation of our own. In some of the ape kind the
resemblance is so striking, that ana∣tomists are puzzled to find in
what part of the human body man's superiority consists; and scarce any
but the metaphysician can draw the line that ultimately divides them.</P>
<P>But, if we compare their internal structure with our own, the
likeness will be found still to encrease, and we shall perceive many
advan∣tages they enjoy in common with us, above the lower tribes of nature.
Like us, they are placed above the class of birds, by bringing forth their
young alive; like us, they are placed above the class of fishes, by
breathing through the lungs; like us, they are placed above the class of
insects, by having red blood circulating through their veins; and lastly,
like us, they are different from almost all the other classes of animated
nature, being either wholly or partly covered with hair. Thus nearly are we
represented in point of conformation to the class of animals immediately
below us; and this shews what little reason we have to be proud 
<PB N="312" REF="330"/> of our persons alone, to the perfection of which
quadrupedes make such very near approaches.</P>
<P>The similitude of quadrupedes to man ob∣tains also in the
fixedness of their nature, and their being less apt to be changed by the
in∣fluence of climate or food than the lower ranks of nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xviii. p. 179.</BIBL></NOTE>. Birds are found
very apt to alter both in colour and size; fishes, likewise, still
more; insects may be quickly brought to change and adapt themselves to the
climate; and, if we descend to plants, which may be al∣lowed to have a kind
of living existence, their kinds may be surprizingly and readily altered,
and taught to assume new forms. The figure of every animal may be
considered as a kind of drapery, which it may be made to put on or off by
human assiduity; in man the drapery is almost invariable; in quadrupedes
it admits of some variation; and the variety may be made greater still as
we descend to the inferior classes of animal existence.</P>
<P>Quadrupedes, although they are thus strongly marked, and in
general divided from the va∣rious kinds around them, yet, still some of
them are often of so equivocal a nature, that it is hard to tell whether they
ought to be ranked in the quadrupede class, or degraded to those below 
<PB N="313" REF="331"/> them. If, for instance, we were to marshal the whole
groupe of animals round man, placing the most perfect next him, and those
most equivocal near the classes they most approach, we should find it
difficult, after the principal had taken their stations near him, where to
place many that lie at the out-skirts of this phalanx. The bat makes a near
approach to the aerial tribe, and might by some be reckoned among the birds.
The porcupine has not less pretensions to that class, being covered with
quills, and shewing that birds are not the only part of nature that are
fur∣nished with such a defence. The armadilla might be referred to the
tribe of insects, or snails, being, like them, covered with a shell; the
seal and the morse might be ranked among the fishes, like them being
furnished with fins, and almost constantly residing in the same
ele∣ment. All these, the farther they recede from the human figure become
less perfect, and may be considered as the lowest kinds of that class
to which we have referred them.</P>
<P>But, although the variety in quadrupedes is thus great, they all
seem well adapted to the stations in which they are placed. There is
scarce one of them, how rudely shaped soever, that is not formed to enjoy
a state of happiness <PB N="314" REF="332"/> fitted to its nature. All its
deformities are only relative to us, but all its enjoyments are pecu∣liarly its
own. We may superficially suppose the Sloth, that takes up months in
climbing a single tree, or the Mole, whose eyes are too small for
distinct vision, are wretched and helpless creatures; but it is probable
that their life, with respect to themselves, is a life of luxury; the
most pleasing food is easily obtained; and, as they are abridged in one
pleasure, it may be doubled in those which remain. Qua∣drupedes, and all
the lower kinds of animals, have, at worst, but the torments of immediate
evil to encounter, and this is but transient and accidental; man has two
sources of calamity, that which he foresees as well as that which he feels;
so that, if his reward were to be in this life alone, then, indeed, would he
be of all beings the most wretched.</P>
<P>The heads of quadrupedes, though differing from each other, are in
general adapted to their way of living. In some it is sharp, the better to
fit the animal for turning up the earth in which its food lies. In some it is
long, in order to give a greater room for the olfactory nerves, as in dogs, who
are to hunt and find out their prey by the scent. In others it is short and
thick, as in the lion, to encrease the strength <PB N="315" REF="333"/> of
the jaw and to fit it the better for combat. In quadrupedes, that feed upon
grass, they are enabled to hold down their heads to the ground, by a strong
tendinous ligament, that runs from the head to the middle of the back. This
serves to raise the head, although it has been held to the ground for
several hours, without any labour, or any assistance from the muscles
of the neck.</P>
<P>The teeth of all animals are entirely fitted to the nature of their
food. Those of such as live upon flesh differ in every respect from
such as live upon vegetables. In the latter they seem entirely made for
gathering and bruising their simple food, being edged before and fitted for
cutting; but broad towards the back of the jaw and fitted for pounding. In the
carnivorous kinds they are sharp before, and fitted rather for holding than
dividing. In the one the teeth serve as grindstones, in the other as
wea∣pons of defence; in both, however, the sur∣face of those teeth which
serve for grinding are unequal; the cavities and risings fitting those of
the opposite so as to tally exactly when the jaws are brought together.
These inequalities better serve for comminuting the food; but they become
smooth with age; and, for this reason, old animals take a longer time to
chew <PB N="316" REF="334"/> their food than such as are in the vigour of
life.</P>
<P>Their legs are not better fitted than their teeth to their
respective wants or enjoyments. In some they are made for strength only,
and to support a vast unwieldy frame, without much flexibility or beautiful
proportion. Thus the legs of the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the
sea-horse, resemble pillars; were they made smaller they would be unfit
to support the body; were they endowed with greater flexibi∣lity, or
swiftness, that would be needless, as they do not pursue other animals
for food; and, conscious of their own superior strength, there are none
that they deign to avoid. Deers, hares, and other creatures, that are to find
safety only in flight, have their legs made entirely for speed; they are
slender and ner∣vous. Were it not for this advantage, every car∣nivorous
animal would soon make them a prey, and their races would be entirely
extinguished. But, in the present state of nature, the means of safety
are rather superior to those of offence: and the pursuing animal must
owe success only to patience, perseverance, and industry. The feet of
some, that live upon fish alone, are made for swimming. The toes of
these animals are joined together with membranes, being web-footed, 
<PB N="317" REF="335"/> like a goose or a duck, by which they swim with
great rapidity. Those animals that lead a life of hostility, and live upon
others, have their feet armed with sharp claws, which some can sheath and
unsheath at will. Those, on the contrary, who lead peaceful lives, have
generally hoofs, which serve some as weapons of defence; and which in all
are better fitted for traversing extensive tracts of rugged coun∣try, than
the claw foot of their pursuers.</P>
<P>The stomach is generally proportioned to the quality of the
animal's food, or the ease with which it is obtained. In those that live
upon flesh and such nourishing substances, it is small and
glandular, affording such juices as are best adapted to digest its
contents; their intestines also, are short and without fatness. On the
contrary, such animals as feed entirely upon vegetables have the stomach
very large; and those who chew the cud have no less than four stomachs,
all which serve as so many la∣boratories, to prepare and turn their
coarse food into proper nourishment. In Africa, where the plants happen to
afford greater nou∣rishment than in our temperate climates, se∣veral
animals, that with us have four stomachs, have there but two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. However, in all animals 
<PB N="318" REF="336"/> the size of the intestines are proportioned to the
nature of the food; where that is furnished in large quantities, the
stomach dilates to answer the encrease. In domestic animals, that are
plentifully supplied, it is large; in the wild animals, that live
precariously, it is much more contracted, and the intestines are much
shorter.</P>
<P>In this manner, all animals are fitted by na∣ture to fill up some
peculiar station. The greatest animals are made for an inoffensive life,
to range the plains and the forest without injuring others; to live upon the
productions of the earth, the grass of the field, or the tender branches of
trees. These, secure in their own strength, neither fly from any other
quadrupedes nor yet attack them: Nature, to the greatest strength has added
the most gentle and harmless dispositions; without this, those
enormous creatures would be more than a match for all the rest of the
creation; for what devastation might not ensue were the elephant, or the
rhinoceros, or the buffalo, as fierce and as mischievous as the tiger or the
rat? In order to oppose these larger animals, and in some mea∣sure to
prevent their exuberance, there is a species of the carnivorous kind, of
inferior strength indeed, but of greater activity and cunning. The lion and
the tiger generally <PB N="319" REF="337"/> watch for the larger kinds of prey,
attack them at some disadvantage, and commonly jump upon them by
surprize. None of the carnivorous kinds, except the dog alone, will make a
vo∣luntary attack, but with the odds on their side. They are all cowards by
nature, and usually catch their prey by a bound from some lurking place,
seldom attempting to invade them openly; for the larger beasts are too
powerful for them, and the smaller too swift.</P>
<P>A lion does not willingly attack an horse; and then only when
compelled by the keenest hunger. The combats between a lion and a horse are
frequent enough in Italy; where they are both inclosed in a kind of
amphi∣theatre, fitted for that purpose. The lion always approaches wheeling
about, while the horse presents his hinder parts to the enemy. The lion in
this manner goes round and round, still narrowing his circle, till he comes
to the proper distance to make his spring; just at the time the lion
springs, the horse lashes with both legs from behind, and, in general,
the odds are in his favour; it more often happening that the lion is stunned,
and struck motionless by the blow, than that he effects his jump between
the horse's shoulders. If the lion is stunned, and left sprawling, the 
<PB N="320" REF="338"/> horse escapes, without attempting to improve his
victory; but if the lion succeeds, he sticks to his prey, and tears the
horse in pieces in a very short time.</P>
<P>But it is not among the larger animals of the forest alone, that
these hostilities are carried on; there is a minuter, and a still more
treacherous contest between the lower ranks of quadrupedes. The panther hunts
for the sheep and the goat; the catamountain, for the hare or the rabbit; and
the wild cat, for the squirrel or the mouse. In proportion as each
carnivorous animal wants strength, it uses all the assistance of
patience, assiduity, and cunning. However, the arts of these to pursue,
are not so great as the tricks of their prey to escape; so that the power
of de∣struction in one class, is inferior to the power of safety in the
other. Were this otherwise, the forest would soon be dispeopled of the
feebler races of animals; and beasts of prey themselves, would want, at one
time, that subsistence which they lavishly destroyed at another.</P>
<P>Few wild animals seek their prey in the day∣time; they are then
generally deterred by their fears of man in the inhabited countries, and by the
excessive heat of the sun in those extensive forests that lie
towards the south, and in which <PB N="321" REF="339"/> they reign the
undisputed tyrants. As soon as the morning, therefore, appears, the
carnivorous animals retire to their dens; and the elephant, the horse, the
deer, and all the hare kinds, those inoffensive tenants of the plain, make
their appearance. But again, at night-fall, the state of hostility begins:
the whole forest then echoes to a variety of different howlings. Nothing
sure can be more terrible than an African land∣scape at the close of
evening: the deep toned roarings of the lion; the shriller yellings of the
tyger; the jackall, pursuing by the scent, and barking like a dog; the
hyaena, with a note pe∣culiarly solitary and dreadful; but to crown all, the
hissing of the various kinds of serpents, that at that time begin their
call, and, as I am assured, make a much louder symphony than the birds in
our groves in a morning.</P>
<P>Beasts of prey seldom devour each other; nor can any thing but
the greatest degree of hunger induce them to it. What they chiefly seek
after, is the deer, or the goat; those harm∣less creatures, that seem
made to embellish nature. These are either pursued or surprized, and
afford the most agreeable repast to their destroyers. The most usual
method with even the fiercest animals, is to hide and crouch near some path
frequented by their prey; or some <PB N="322" REF="340"/> water, where cattle
come to drink; and seize them at once with a bound. The lion and the tyger
leap twenty feet at a spring; and this, rather than their swiftness or
strength, is what they have most to depend upon for a supply. There is
scarce one of the deer or hare kind, that is not very easily capable of
escaping them by its swiftness; so that whenever any of these fall a
prey, it must be owing to their own in∣attention.</P>
<P>But there is another class of the carnivorous kind, that hunt by
the scent, and which it is much more difficult to escape. It is remarkable,
that all animals of this kind pursue in a pack; and encourage each other by
their mutual cries. The jackall, the syagush, the wolf, and the dog, are of
this kind: they pursue with patience rather than swiftness; their prey
flies at first, and leaves them for miles behind; but they keep on with a
constant steady pace, and excite each other by a general spirit of
industry and emulation, till at last they share the common plunder. But
it too often happens, that the larger beasts of prey, when they hear a cry of
this kind begun, pursue the pack, and when they have hunted down the animal,
come in and monopolize the spoil. This has given rise to the report of the
jackall's being the lion's <PB N="323" REF="341"/> provider; when the reality
is, that the jackall hunts for itself, and the lion is an unwelcome intruder
upon the fruits of his toil.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, with all the powers which car∣nivorous animals are
possessed of, they gene∣rally lead a life of famine and fatigue. Their
prey has such a variety of methods for escaping, that they sometimes
continue without food for a fortnight together: but nature has endowed them
with a degree of patience, equal to the severity of their state; so that
as their subsistence is precarious, their appetites are complying. They
usually seize their prey with a roar, either of seeming delight, or
perhaps to terrify it from resistance. They frequently devour it, bones and
all, in the most ravenous manner; and then retire to their dens, continuing
in∣active till the calls of hunger again excite their courage and industry.
But as all their me∣thods of pursuit are counteracted by the arts of
evasion, they often continue to range with∣out success, supporting a
state of famine for several days, nay, sometimes, weeks together. Of
their prey, some find protection in holes, in which nature has directed them
to bury them∣selves; some find safety by swiftness; and such as are
possessed of neither of these advantages, generally herd together,
and endeavour to repel <PB N="324" REF="342"/> invasion by united force. The
very sheep, which to us seem so defenceless, are by no means so in a
state of nature; they are furnished with arms of defence, and a very great
degree of swiftness; but they are still further assisted by their
spirit of mutual defence: the females fall into the center; and the males,
forming a ring round them, oppose their horns to the assailants. Some
animals, that feed upon fruits which are to be found only at one time of the
year, fill their holes with several sorts of plants, which enable them to
lie concealed during the hard frosts of the winter, contented with their
prison, since it affords them plenty and pro∣tection. These holes are dug
with so much art, that there seems the design of an architect in the
formation. There are usually two aper∣tures, by one of which the little
inhabitant can always escape, when the enemy is in possession of the
other. Many creatures are equally care∣ful of avoiding their enemies, by
placing a cen∣tinel, to warn them of the approach of danger. These generally
perform this duty by turns; and they know how to punish such as have
neg∣lected their post, or have been unmindful of the common safety. Such
are a part of the efforts that the weaker races of quadrupedes exert, to avoid
their invaders; and, in general, they are <PB N="325" REF="343"/> attended with
success. The arts of instinct are most commonly found an overmatch for
the in∣vasions of instinct. Man is the only creature against whom all
their little tricks can scarce prevail. Wherever he has spread his
dominion, scarce any flight can save, or any retreat har∣bour; wherever he
comes, terror seems to fol∣low, and all society ceases among the inferior
tenants of the plain; their union against him can yield them no protection,
and their cunning is but weakness. In their fellow brutes, they have an enemy
whom they can oppose with an equality of advantage; they can oppose fraud
or swiftness to force; or numbers to invasion: but what can be done
against such an enemy as man, who finds them out though unseen, and
though remote destroys them? Wherever he comes, all the contest among the
meaner ranks seem to be at an end, or is carried on only by surprize. Such
as he has thought proper to protect, have calmly submitted to his protection;
such as he has found it convenient to destroy, carry on an unequal war, and
their numbers are every day decreasing.</P>
<P>The wild animal is subject to few alterations; and, in a state
of savage nature, continues for ages the same, in size, shape, and
colour. But it is otherwise when subdued, and taken <PB N="326" REF="344"/>
under the protection of man; its external form, and even its internal
structure, are altered by human assiduity: and this is one of the first
and greatest causes of the variety that we see among the several
quadrupedes of the same species. Man appears to have changed the very
nature of domestic animals, by cultivation and care. A domestic animal is a
slave that seems to have few other desires but such as man is willing
to allow it. Humble, patient, resigned, and at∣tentive, it fills up the
duties of its station; ready for labour, and content with
subsistence.</P>
<P>Almost all domestic animals seem to bear the marks of
servitude strong upon them. All the varieties in their colour, all the
fineness and length of their hair, together with the depending length of
their ears, seem to have arisen from a long continuance of domestic
slavery. What an immense variety is there to be found in the ordinary race
of dogs and horses! the principal differences of which has been effected by
the industry of man, so adapting the food, the treat∣ment, the labour, and
the climate, that nature seems almost to have forgotten her original
de∣sign; and the tame animal no longer bears any resemblance to its
ancestors in the woods around him.</P>
<P>In this manner, nature is under a kind of <PB N="327" REF="345"/>
constraint, in those animals we have taught to live in a state of
servitude near us. The savage animals preserve the marks of their first
for∣mation; their colours are generally the same; a rough dusky brown, or a
tawny, seem almost their only varieties. But it is otherwise in the tame;
their colours are various, and their forms different from each other. The
nature of the climate, indeed, operates upon all; but more particularly on
these. That nourishment which is prepared by the hand of man, chosen not
to their appetites, but to suit his own convenience, that climate the rigours
of which he can soften, and that employment to which they are sometimes
assigned, produce a number of di∣stinctions that are not to be found
among the savage animals. These at first were accidental, but in time
became hereditary; and a new race of artificial monsters are propagated,
rather to answer the purposes of human pleasure, than their own
convenience. In short, their very appetites may be changed; and those that
feed only upon grass, may be rendered carnivorous. I have seen a sheep
that would eat flesh, and an horse that was fond of oysters.</P>
<P>But not their appetites, or their figure alone, but their very
dispositions, and their natural sagacity, are altered by the vicinity of
man. <PB N="328" REF="346"/> In those countries where men have seldom
in∣truded, some animals have been found, esta∣blished in a kind of civil
state of society. Re∣mote from the tyranny of man, they seem to have a
spirit of mutual benevolence, and mu∣tual friendship. The beavers, in
these distant solitudes, are known to build like architects, and rule
like citizens. The habitations that these have been seen to erect, exceed
the houses of the human inhabitants of the same country, both in neatness
and convenience. But as soon as man intrudes upon their society, they
seem impressed with the terrors of their inferior situation, their
spirit of society ceases, the bond is dissolved, and every animal
looks for safety in solitude, and there tries all its little industry to
shift only for itself.</P>
<P>Next to human influence, the climate seems to have the
strongest effects both upon the na∣ture and the form of quadrupedes. As in
man, we have seen some alterations, produced by the variety of his
situation; so in the lower ranks, that are more subject to variation, the
influence of climate is more readily perceived. As these are more nearly
attached to the earth, and in a manner connected to the soil; as they have
none of the arts of shielding off the inclemency of the weather, or
softening the rigours of the <PB N="329" REF="347"/> sun, they are
consequently more changed by its variations. In general, it may be remarked,
that the colder the country, the larger and the warmer is the fur of each
animal; it being wisely provided by nature, that the inhabitant should be
adapted to the rigours of its situation. Thus the fox and wolf, which in
temperate climates have but short hair, have a fine long fur in the frozen
regions near the pole. On the contrary, those dogs which with us have long
hair, when carried to Guinea, or Angola, in a short time cast their thick
covering, and assume a lighter dress, and one more adapted to the warmth
of the country. The beaver, and the ermine, which are found in the greatest
plenty in the cold regions, are remarkable for the warmth and delicacy of their
furs; while the elephant, and the rhinoceros, that are natives of the line,
have scarce any hair at all. Not but that human industry can, in some
measure, co-operate with, or repress the effects of climate in this
particular. It is well known what al∣terations are produced by proper care, in
the sheep's fleece, in different parts of our own country; and the same
industry is pursued with a like success in Syria, where many of their
animals are cloathed with a long and beautiful hair, which they take care to
improve, as they <PB N="330" REF="348"/> work it into that stuff called
camblet, so well known in different parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The disposition of the animal seems also not less marked
by the climate than the figure. The same causes that seem to have
rendered the human inhabitants of the rigorous climates savage and ignorant,
have also operated upon their animals. Both at the line and the pole, the
wild quadrupedes are fierce and untame∣able. In these latitudes, their
savage dispo∣sitions having not been quelled by any efforts from man, and
being still farther stimulated by the severity of the weather, they
continue fierce and untractable. Most of the attempts which have hitherto
been made to tame the wild beasts brought home from the pole or the equator,
have proved ineffectual. They are gentle and harmless enough while young; but
as they grow up, they acquire their natural ferocity, and snap at the hand
that feeds them. It may indeed, in general, be asserted, that in all
countries where the men are most barbarous, the beasts are most fierce
and cruel: and this is but a natural consequence of the struggle be∣tween
man and the more savage animals of the forest; for in proportion as he is
weak and timid, they must be bold and intrusive; in pro∣portion as his
dominion is but feebly supported, <PB N="331" REF="349"/> their rapacity
must be more obnoxious. In the extensive countries, therefore, lying round
the pole, or beneath the line, the quadrupedes are fierce and formidable.
Africa has ever been remarked for the brutality of its men, and the
fierceness of its animals: its lions and its leo∣pards are not less
terrible than its crocodiles and its serpents; their dispositions seem
entirely marked with the rigours of the climate; and being bred in an extreme
of heat, they shew a peculiar ferocity, that neither the force of man can
conquer, nor his arts allay. However, it is happy for the wretched inhabitants
of those climates, that its most formidable animals are all solitary
ones; that they have not learnt the art of uniting, to oppress mankind; but
each depending on its own strength, invades without any assistant.</P>
<P>The food also is another cause in the variety, which we find
among quadrupedes of the same kind. Thus the beasts which feed in the
valley are generally larger than those which glean a scanty
subsistence on the mountain. Such as live in the warm climates, where the
plants are much larger and more succulent than with us, are equally
remarkable for their bulk. The ox fed in the plains of Indostan, is very much
larger than that which is more hardily main∣tained <PB N="332" REF="350"/> on
the side of the Alps. The deserts of Africa, where the plants are extremely
nourish∣ing, produce the largest and fiercest animals; and perhaps, for a
contrary reason, America is found not to produce such large animals as are
seen in the ancient continent. But, what∣ever be the reason, the fact is
certain, that while America exceeds us in the size of its rep∣tiles of all
kinds, it is far inferior in its qua∣drupede productions. Thus, for instance,
the largest animal of that country is the tapir, which can by no means be
compared to the elephant of Africa. Its beasts of prey also, are divested
of that strength and courage which is so dangerous in this part of the
world. The American lion, tyger, and leopard, if such di∣minutive creatures
deserve these names, are neither so fierce nor so valiant as those of
Africa and Asia. The tyger of Bengal has been seen to measure twelve feet
in length, without in∣cluding the tail; whereas the American tyger seldom
exceeds three. This difference obtains still more in the other animals of
that country, so that some have been of opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE> that all quadrupedes in Southern
America are of a dif∣ferent species from those most resembling them in
the old world; and that there are none <PB N="333" REF="351"/> which are common
to both but such as have entered America by the north; and which, being able
to bear the rigours of the frozen pole, have travelled from the ancient
continent, by that passage, into the new. Thus the bear, the wolf, the elk,
the stag, the fox, and the beaver, are known to the inhabitants as well of
North America as of Russia; while most of the various kinds to the
southward, in both continents, bear no resemblance to each other. Upon the
whole, such as peculiarly belong to the new continent are without any marks
of the quadrupede perfection. They are almost wholly destitute of the power
of defence; they have neither formidable teeth, horns, or tail; their figure is
ungainly, and their limbs ill proportioned. Some among them, such as the ant,
bear, and the sloth, appear so miserably formed as scarce to have the
power of moving and eating. They, seemingly, drag out a mi∣serable and
languid existence in the most de∣sert solitude; and would quickly have
been de∣stroyed in a country where there were inhabit∣ants, or powerful
beasts to oppose them.</P>
<P>But, if the quadrupedes of the new conti∣nent be less, they are
found in much greater abundance; for it is a rule that obtains through nature,
that the smallest animals multiply the <PB N="334" REF="352"/> fastest.
The goat, imported from Europe to South America, soon begins to degenerate;
but as it grows less it becomes more prolific; and, instead of one kid at a
time, or two at the most, it generally produces five, and some∣times more.
What there is in the food, or the climate, that produces this change, we have
not been able to learn; we might be apt to ascribe it to the heat, but that
on the African coast, where it is still hotter, this rule does not obtain;
for the goat, instead of degenerating there, seems rather to improve.</P>
<P>However, the rule is general among all qua∣drupedes, that those
which are large and for∣midable produce but few at a time; while such as are
mean and contemptible are extremely prolific. The lion, or tyger, have seldom
above two cubs at a litter; while the cat, that is of a similar nature, is
usually seen to have five or six. In this manner, the lower tribes become
extremely numerous; and, but for this sur∣prizing fecundity, from their
natural weak∣ness, they would quickly be extirpated. The breed of mice, for
instance, would have long since been blotted from the earth, were the
mouse as slow in production as the elephant. But it has been wisely
provided that such ani∣mals as can make but little resistance, should 
<PB N="335" REF="353"/> at least have a means of repairing the destruc∣tion,
which they must often suffer, by their quick reproduction; that they
should encrease even among enemies, and multiply under the hand of the
destroyer. On the other hand, it has as wisely been ordered by Providence,
that the larger kinds should produce but slowly; otherwise, as they
require proportional sup∣plies from nature, they would quickly consume
their own stores; and, of consequence, many of them would soon perish
through want; so that life would thus be given without the ne∣cessary
means of subsistence. In a word, Pro∣vidence has most wisely
ballanced the strength of the great against the weakness of the little.
Since it was necessary that some should be great and others mean,
since it was expedient that some should live upon others, it has
assisted the weakness of one by granting it fruitfulness; and
diminished the numbers of the other by in∣fecundity.</P>
<P>In consequence of this provision, the larger creatures, which
bring forth few at a time, sel∣dom begin to generate till they have nearly
ac∣quired their full growth. On the contrary, those which bring many,
reproduce before they have arrived at half their natural size. Thus the
horse and the bull are nearly at their best <PB N="336" REF="354"/> before
they begin to breed; the hog and the rabbit scarce leave the teat before they
become parents in turn. Almost all animals likewise continue the time of
their pregnancy in pro∣portion to their size. The mare continues eleven
months with foal, the cow nine, the wolf five, and the bitch nine weeks. In
all, the intermediate litters are the most fruitful; the first and the
last generally producing the fewest in number and the worst of the
kind.</P>
<P>Whatever be the natural disposition of ani∣mals at other times,
they all acquire new cou∣rage when they consider themselves as defend∣ing
their young. No terrors can then drive them from the post of duty; the
mildest begin to exert their little force, and resist the most
formidable enemy. Where resistance is hope∣less, they then incur every
danger, in order to rescue their young by flight, and retard their own
expedition by providing for their little ones. When the female opossum, an
animal of America, is pursued, she instantly takes her young into a
false belly, with which nature has supplied her, and carries them off, or
dies in the endeavour. I have been lately assured of a she-fox which,
when hunted, took her cub in her mouth, and run for several miles without
quit∣ting it, until at last she was forced to leave it 
<PB N="337" REF="355"/> behind, upon the approach of a mastiff, as she ran
through a farmer's yard. But, if at this period the mildest animals acquire
new fierceness, how formidable must those be that subsist by
rapine! At such times, no obstacles can stop their ravage, nor no threats
can ter∣rify; the lioness then seems more hardy than even the lion
himself. She attacks men and beasts indiscriminately, and carries all
she can overcome reeking to her cubs, whom she thus early accustoms to
slaughter. Milk, in the carnivorous animals, is much more sparing than in
others; and it may be for this reason that all such carry home their prey
alive, that, in feeding their young, its blood may supply the deficiencies of
nature, and serve instead of that milk, with which they are so
sparingly supplied.</P>
<P>Nature, that has thus given them courage to defend their young, has
given them instinct to chuse the proper times of copulation, so as to
bring forth when the provision suited to each kind is to be found in the
greatest plenty. The wolf, for instance, couples in December, so that the
time of pregnancy continuing five months it may have its young in April. The
mare, who goes eleven months, admits the horse in summer, in order to foal
about the <PB N="338" REF="356"/> beginning of May. On the contrary, those
animals which lay up provisions for the winter, such as the beaver and the
marmotte, couple in the latter end of autumn, so as to have their young about
January, against which season they have provided a very comfortable
store. These seasons for coupling however, among some of the
domestic kinds, are generally in conse∣quence of the quantity of
provisions with which they are at any time supplied. Thus we may, by
feeding any of these animals, and keeping off the rigour of the climate, make
them breed whenever we please. In this manner those contrive who produce
lambs all the year round.</P>
<P>The choice of situation in bringing forth is also very
remarkable. In most of the rapacious kinds, the female takes the utmost
precautions to hide the place of her retreat from the male; who otherwise,
when pressed by hunger, would be apt to devour her cubs. She seldom,
there∣fore, strays far from the den, and never ap∣proaches it while he is in
view, nor visits him again till her young are capable of providing for
themselves. Such animals as are of tender constitutions take the utmost
care to provide a place of warmth as well as safety, for their young; the
rapacious kinds bring forth in the thickest woods; those that chew the cud,
with <PB N="339" REF="357"/> the various tribes of the vermin kind, choose
some hiding place in the neighbourhood of man. Some dig holes in the ground;
some choose the hollow of a tree; and all the am∣phibious kinds bring up
their young near the water, and accustom them betimes to their proper
element.</P>
<P>Thus Nature seems kindly careful for the protection of the
meanest of her creatures: but there is one class of quadrupedes that
seems entirely left to chance, that no parent stands forth to protect, nor
no instructor leads, to teach the arts of subsistence. These are the
quadrupedes that are brought forth from the egg, such as the lizard, the
tortoise, and the cro∣codile. The fecundity of all other animals com∣pared
with these is sterility itself. These bring forth above two hundred at
a time; but, as the offspring is more numerous, the parental care is less
exerted. Thus the numerous brood of eggs are, without farther solicitude,
bu∣ried in the warm sands of the shore, and the heat of the sun alone is
left to bring them to perfection. To this perfection they arrive al∣most as
soon as disengaged from the shell. Most of them, without any other
guide than instinct, immediately make to the water. In their passage
thither, they have numberless <PB N="340" REF="358"/> enemies to fear. The
birds of prey that haunt the shore, the beasts that accidentally come that
way, and even the animals themselves that give them birth are known, with a
strange rapacity, to thin their numbers as well as the rest.</P>
<P>But it is kindly ordered by Providence, that these animals which
are mostly noxious, should thus have many destroyers; were it not for
this, by their extreme fecundity, they would soon over-run the earth, and
cumber all our plains with deformity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the Horse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As it may happen
that, in a description where it is the aim rather to insert what is not
usually known, than all that is known, some of the more obvious particulars
may be omitted; I will take leave to subjoin in the notes the
characteristic marks of each animal, as given us by Lin∣naeus. The horse,
with six cutting teeth before; and single hoofed; a native of Europe and
the East; (but I rather believe of Africa) a generous, proud, and strong
animal; fit either for the draught, the course, or the road; he is delighted
with woods; he takes care of his hinder parts; defends himself from the flies
with his tail; scratches his fellow; defends its young; calls by neighing;
sleeps after night-fall; fights by kicking, and by biting also; rolls on
the ground when he sweats; eats the grass closer than the ox;
distributes the seed by dung∣ing; wants a gall bladder; never vomits; the
foal is produced with the feet stretched out; he is injured by being struck
on the ear; upon the stiffle; by being caught by the nose in barnacles; by
having his teeth rubbed with tallow; by the herb padus; by the herb phalandria;
by the cruculio; by the conops. His dis∣eases are different in different
countries. A consumption of the ethmoid bones of the nose, called the
glanders, is with us the most infectious and fatal. He eats hem∣lock without
injury. The mare goes with foal 290 days. The placenta is not fixed. He
acquires the canine teeth not till the age of five years.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>ANIMALS of the horse kind deserve a place next to man, in an
history of nature. Their <PB N="342" REF="360"/> activity, their strength,
their usefulness, and their beauty, all contribute to render them the
principal objects of our curiosity and care; a race of creatures in whose
welfare we are in∣terested next to our own.</P>
<P>Of all the quadrupede animals, the horse seems the most
beautiful; the noble largeness of his form, the glossy smoothness of
his skin, the graceful ease of his motions, and the exact symmetry of his
shape, have taught us to re∣gard him as the first, and as the most
perfectly formed; and yet, what is extraordinary enough, if we examine him
internally, his structure will be found the most different from that of man
of all other quadrupedes whatsoever. As the ape approaches us the nearest
in internal con∣formation, so the horse is the most remote<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Histoire Naturelle, Daubenton, vol. vii. p.
374.</BIBL></NOTE>; a striking proof that there may be oppositions of
beauty, and that all grace is not to be referred to one standard.</P>
<P>To have an idea of this noble animal in his native simplicity, we
are not to look for him in the pastures, or the stables, to which he has
been consigned by man; but in those wild and extensive plains where he
has been originally produced, where he ranges without controul, and riots in
all the variety of luxurious nature. <PB N="343" REF="361"/> In this state of
happy independence, he dis∣dains the assistance of man, which only
tends to servitude. In those boundless tracts, whether of Africa, or New
Spain, where he runs at liberty, he seems no way incommoded with the
inconveniencies to which he is subject in Europe. The continual verdure of
the fields supplies his wants; and the climate that never knows a winter
suits his constitution, which na∣turally seems adapted to heat. His
enemies of the forest are but few, for none but the greater kinds will
venture to attack him; any one of these he is singly able to overcome;
while at the same time he is content to find safety in society; for the
wild horses of those countries always herd together.</P>
<P>In these countries, therefore, the horses are often seen
feeding in droves of five or six hun∣dred. As they do not carry on war
against any other race of animals, they are satisfied to re∣main entirely
upon the defensive. The pa∣stures on which they live satisfy all their
appe∣tites, and all other precautions are purely for their security, in
case of a surprize. As they are never attacked but at a disadvantage,
when∣ever they sleep in the forests, they have always one among their
number that stands as centinel, <PB N="344" REF="362"/> to give notice of any
approaching danger; and this office they take by turns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictionaire Universelle, Des Animaux, p.
19.</BIBL></NOTE>. If a man ap∣proaches them while they are feeding by day,
their centinel walks up boldly near him, as if to examine his strength, or to
intimidate him from proceeding; but, as the man approaches within pistol
shot, the centinel then thinks it high time to alarm his fellows; this he
does by a loud kind of snorting, upon which they all take the signal, and
fly off with the speed of the wind; their faithful centinel bringing up the
rear<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Labat. tome vii.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is not easy to say from what country the horse came
originally. It should seem that the colder climates do not agree with his
consti∣tution; for, although he is found almost in them all, yet his form
is altered there, and he is found at once diminutive and ill shaped. We have
the testimony of the ancients that there were wild horses once in Europe;
at present, however, they are totally brought under subjec∣tion; and even
those which are found in Ame∣rica are of a Spanish breed, which being
sent thither upon its first discovery, have since be∣come wild, and
have spread over all the south <PB N="345" REF="363"/> of that vast
continent, almost to the Streights of Magellan. These, in general, are a
small breed, of about fourteen hands high. They have thick jaws and clumsy
joints; their ears and neck also are long; they are easily tamed; for the
horse by nature is a gentle complying creature, and resists rather from
fear than ob∣stinacy. They are caught by a kind of nooze, and then held
fast by the legs, and tyed to a tree, where they are left for two days,
without food or drink. By that time, they begin to grow manageable; and in
some weeks they become as tame as if they had never been in a state of
wildness. If by any accident they are once more set at liberty, they never
become wild again, but know their masters, and come to their call. Some of
the buccaneers have often been agreeably surprized, after a long absence,
to see their faithful horses once more present themselves, with their
usual assiduity; and come up, with fond submission, to receive the
rein.</P>
<P>These American horses, however, cannot properly be ranked among
the wild races, since they were originally bred from such as were tame. It
is not in the new, but the old world that we are to look for this animal, in a
true state of nature; in the extensive deserts of <PB N="346" REF="364"/>
Africa, in Arabia, and those wide spread coun∣tries that separate Tartary
from the more southern nations. Vast droves of these animals are seen
wild among the Tartars: they are of a small breed, extremely swift, and
very readily evade their pursuers. As they go together, they will not admit
of any strange animals among them, though even of their own kind. Whenever
they find a tame horse attempting to associate with them, they
instantly gather round him, and soon oblige him to seek safety by
flight. There are vast numbers also of wild horses to the north of China,
but they are of a weak timid breed; small of stature and useless in
war.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope also there are numbers of horses, in a
state of nature, but small, vicious, and untameable. They are found wild
also in several other parts of Africa; but the wretched inhabitants of that
country either want the art to tame them, or seem ig∣norant of their uses.
It is common with the Negroes, who are carried over from thence to America,
when they first see an horse, to testify both terror and surprize.
These poor men seem not to have any knowledge of such a crea∣ture; and,
though the horse is probably a native of their own country, they have let all
the rest <PB N="347" REF="365"/> of mankind enjoy the benefit of his
services, without turning them to any advantage at home. In some parts of
Africa, therefore, where the horse runs wild, the natives seem to
consider him rather in the light of a dainty, for food, than a useful
creature, capable of assisting them either in war or in labour: riding
seems a refinement that the natives of Angola, or Caffraria, have not as yet
been able to attain to; and whenever they catch an horse, it is only with an
intent to eat him.</P>
<P>But of all countries in the world, where the horse runs wild,
Arabia produces the most beautiful breed, the most generous, swift, and
persevering. They are found, though not in great numbers, in the deserts of
that country; and the natives use every stratagem to take them. Although
they are active and beautiful, yet they are not so large as those that are
bred up tame; they are of a brown colour; their mane and tail very short, and
the hair black and tufted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Marm. Descript. de
l'Afrique, l. 1, p. 51.</BIBL></NOTE>. Their swiftness is incredible; the
attempt to pursue them in the usual manner of the chace, with dogs, would
be entirely fruitless. Such is the rapidity of their flight, that they are
instantly out of view, and the dogs themselves give up the vain pursuit.
The only <PB N="348" REF="366"/> method, therefore, of taking them is by traps,
hidden in the sand, which entangling their feet, the hunter at length comes
up, and either kills them or carries them home alive. If the horse be young,
he is considered among the Arabians as a very great delicacy; and they
feast upon him while any part is found remaining; but if, from his shape or
vigour, he promises to be ser∣viceable in his more noble capacity, they
take the usual methods of taming him, by fatigue and hunger, and he soon
becomes an useful do∣mestic animal.</P>
<P>The usual manner of trying their swiftness is by hunting the
ostrich: the horse is the only animal whose speed is comparable to that
of this creature, which is found in the sandy plains, with which those
countries abound. The instant the ostrich perceives itself aimed at, it
makes to the mountains, while the horse∣man pursues with all the
swiftness possible, and endeavours to cut off its retreat. The chace
then continues along the plain, while the ostrich makes use of both legs
and wings to assist its motion. However, an horse of the first
speed is able to out run it; so that the poor animal is then obliged to
have recourse to art to elude the hunter, by frequently turning: at length,
finding all escape hopeless, it hides its head <PB N="349" REF="367"/>
wherever it can, and suffers itself tamely to be taken. If the horse, in
a trial of this kind, shews great speed, and is not readily tired, his
price becomes proportionably great; and there are some horses valued at a
thousand ducats.</P>
<P>But the horses thus caught, or trained in this manner, are at
present but very few; the value of Arabian horses, over all the world, has
in a great measure thinned the deserts of the wild breed; and there are
very few to be found in those countries, except such as are tame. The
Arabians, as we are told by historians, first began the management of
horses in the time of Sheque Ismael. Before that they wandered wild along
the face of the country, ne∣glected and useless; but the natives then
first began to tame their fierceness, and to improve their beauty; so
that at present they possess a race of the most beautiful horses in
the whole world, with which they drive a trade, and furnish the stables of
princes at immense prices.</P>
<P>There is scarce an Arabian, how poor so∣ever, but is provided
with his horse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. They, in
general, make use of mares in their ordinary excursions; experience having
taught them that they support fatigue, thirst, and hunger, 
<PB N="350" REF="368"/> better than the horses are found to do. They are
also less vicious, of a gentler nature, and are not so apt to neigh. They
are more harm∣less also among themselves, not so apt to kick or hurt
each other, but remain whole days to∣gether without the least mischief. The
Turks, on the contrary, are not fond of mares; and the Arabians sell them
such horses as they do not chuse to keep for stallions at home. They
pre∣serve the pedigree of their horses with great care, and for several
ages back. They know their alliances and all their genealogy; they
distin∣guish the races by different names, and divide them into three
classes. The first is that of the nobles, the ancient breed, and
unadul∣terated on either side: the second is that of the horses of the
ancient race, but adulterated; and the third is that of the common and inferior
kind: the last they sell at a low price; but those of the first
class, and even of the second, amongst which are found horses of equal
value to the former, are sold extremely dear. They know, by long experience,
the race of an horse by his appearance; they can tell the name, the
surname, the colour, and the marks properly belonging to each. When they are
not possessed of stallions of the noble race them∣selves, for their
mares, they borrow from their <PB N="351" REF="369"/> neighbours, paying a
proper price as with us, and receive a written attestation of the whole. In
this attestation is contained the name of the horse and the mare, and their
respective ge∣nealogies. When the mare has produced her foal, new
witnesses are called, and a new at∣testation signed, in which are
described the marks of the foal, and the day noted when it was brought forth.
These attestations encrease the value of the horse; and they are given
to the person who buys him. The most ordinary mare of this race sells for
five hundred crowns; there are many that sell for a thousand; and some of
the very finest kinds for fourteen or fifteen hundred pound. As the Arabians
have no other house but a tent to live in, this also serves them for a
stable; so that the mare, the foal, the husband, the wife, and the
children, lie all together indiscriminately; the little chil∣dren are often
seen upon the body, or the neck of the mare, while these continue
inoffensive and harmless, permitting them thus to play with and caress
them without any injury. The Arabians never beat their horses: they treat
them gently; they speak to them, and seem to hold a discourse; they
use them as friends; they never attempt to encrease their speed by the
whip, nor spur them but in cases of neces∣sity. <PB N="352" REF="370"/>
However, when this happens, they set off with amazing swiftness; they
leap over ob∣stacles with as much agility as a buck; and, if the rider
happens to fall, they are so manage∣able that they stand stock still in
the midst of their most rapid career. The Arabian horses are of a middle
size, easy in their motions, and rather inclined to leanness than fat.
They are regularly dressed every morning and evening, and with such care
that the smallest roughness is not left upon their skins. They wash
the legs, the mane, and the tail, which they never cut; and which they seldom
comb, left they should thin the hair. They give them nothing to eat during
the day; they only give them to drink once or twice; and at sun-set they
hang a bag to their heads, in which there is about half a bushel of clean
barley. They continue eating the whole night, and the bag is again taken away
the next morning. They are turned out to pasture in the beginning of March,
when the grass is pretty high, and at which time the mares are given to the
stallion. When the spring is past, they take them again from pa∣sture,
and they get neither grass nor hay during the rest of the year; barley is
their only food, except now and then a little straw. The mane of the foal is
always clipped off when about a <PB N="353" REF="371"/> year or eighteen months
old, in order to make it stronger and thicker. They begin to break them at
two years old, or two years and an half at farthest; they never saddle or
bridle them till at that age; and then they are always kept ready saddled at
the door of the tent, from morning till sun-set, in order to be prepared
against any surprize. They at present seem sensible of the great
advantage their horses are to the country; there is a law, therefore, that
prohibits the exportation of the mares; and such stallions as are brought
into England are generally purchased on the eastern shores of Africa, and
come round to us by the Cape of Good Hope. They are in general less in
sta∣ture than our own, being not above fourteen, or fourteen hands and an
half high; their mo∣tions are much more graceful and swifter than of our own
horses; but, nevertheless, their speed is far from being equal; they run
higher from the ground; their stroke is not so long and close; and they
are far inferior in bottom. Still, however, they must be considered as the
first and finest breed in the world; and that from which all others have
derived their prin∣cipal qualifications. It is even probable that Arabia is the
original country of horses; since there, instead of crossing the
breed, they take <PB N="354" REF="372"/> every precaution to keep it entire. In
other countries they must continually change the races, or their horses
would soon degenerate; but there the same blood has past down through a
long succession, without any dimi∣nution either of force or beauty.</P>
<P>The race of Arabian horses has spread itself into Barbary,
among the Moors, and has even extended across that extensive continent to
the western shores of Africa. Among the Negroes of Gambia and Senegal, the
chiefs of the country are possessed of horses; which, though little,
are very beautiful and extremely manageable. Instead of barley they are fed,
in those coun∣tries, with maize, bruised and reduced into meal, and mixed
up with milk when they de∣sign to fatten them. These are considered as
next to the Arabian horses, both for swiftness and beauty; but they are
rather still smaller than the former. The Italians have a peculiar sport,
in which horses of this breed run against each other. They have no riders,
but saddles so formed as to flap against the horses' sides as they
move, and thus to spur them forward. They are set to run in a kind of
railed walk, about a mile long, out of which they never attempt to escape;
but, when they once set forward, they never stop, although the walk from
one end <PB N="355" REF="373"/> to the other is covered with a crowd of
spec∣tators, which opens and gives way as the horses approach. Our horses
would scarcely, in this manner, face a crowd, and continue their speed,
without a rider, through the midst of a multi∣tude; and, indeed, it is a
little surprizing how in such a place the horses find their own way.
How∣ever, what our English horses may want in saga∣city, they make up by
their swiftness; and it has been found upon computation that their speed
is nearly one fourth greater even carrying a rider than that of the
swiftest Barb without one.</P>
<P>The Arabian breed has been diffused into Egypt as well as Barbary,
and into Persia also; where, as we are told by Marcus Paulus, there are
studs of ten thousand white mares all together, very fleet, and with the
hoof so hard that shoeing is unnecessary. In these countries, they in
general give their horses the same treatment that they give in Arabia,
except that they litter them upon a bed of their own dung, dried in the sun,
and then reduced to powder. When this, which is spread under the horse
about five inches thick, is moistened, they dry it again, and spread it as
before. The horses of these countries a good deal resemble each other.
They are usually of a slender make; their legs fine, bony, and 
<PB N="356" REF="374"/> far apart; a thin mane; a fine crest; a beau∣tiful
head; the ear small and well pointed; the shoulder thin; the side
rounded, without any unsightly prominence; the croup is a little of the
longest, and the tail is generally set high. The race of horses, however,
is much dege∣nerated in Numidia; the natives having been discouraged from
keeping the breed up by the Turks, who seize upon all the good horses,
with∣out paying the owners the smallest gratuity for their care in bringing
them up. The Tingitanians and Egyptians have now, therefore, the fame of
rearing the finest horses, both for size and beauty. The smallest of
these last are usually sixteen hands high; and all of them shaped, as
they express it, with the elegance of an antelope.</P>
<P>Next to the barb, travellers generally rank the Spanish genette.
These horses, like the former, are little, but extremely swift and
beautiful. The head is something of the largest; the mane thick; the ears
long, but well pointed; the eyes filled with fire; the shoulder thickish,
and the breast full and large. The croup round and large; the legs beautiful,
and without hair; the pastern a little of the longest, as in the Barb, and
the hoof rather too high. Never∣theless, they move with great ease, and
carry <PB N="357" REF="375"/> themselves extremely well. Their most usual
colour is black, or a dark bay. They seldom or never have white legs, or
white snip. The Spaniards, who have a groundless aversion to these
marks, never breed from such as have them. They are all branded on the
buttock with the owner's name; and those of the province of Andalusia
pass for the best. These are said to possess courage, obedience,
grace, and spirit, in a greater degree than even the Barb; and, for this
reason, they have been preferred as war horses to those of any other
country.</P>
<P>The Italian horses were once more beautiful than they are at
present, for they have greatly neglected the breed. Nevertheless, there are
still found some beautiful horses among them, particularly among the
Neapolitans, who chiefly use them for the draught. In general, they have
large heads and thick necks. They are also restiff, and consequently
unmanageable. These faults, however, are recompenced by the largeness of
their size, by their spirit, and the beauty of their motion. They are
excellent for shew, and have a particular aptitude to prance.</P>
<P>The Danish horses are of such an excellent size and so
strong a make, that they are pre∣ferred to all others for the draught. There 
<PB N="358" REF="376"/> are some of them perfectly well shaped; but this is
but seldom seen, for in general they are found to have a thick neck, heavy
shoulders, long and hollow back, and a narrow croup: however, they all move
well, and are found excellent both for parade and war. They are of all colours,
and often of whimsical ones, some being streaked like the tyger, or
mottled like the leopard.</P>
<P>The German horses are originally from Arabian and Barbary
stocks; nevertheless, they appear to be small and ill shaped: it is
said also, that they are weak and washy, with tender hoofs. The Hungarian
horses, on the other hand, are excellent for the draught, as well as the
saddle. The Hussars, who use them in war, usually slit their
nostrils; which is done, as it is said, to prevent their neighing, but,
perhaps, without any real foundation.</P>
<P>The Dutch breed is good for the draught, and is generally used for
that purpose over Europe: the best come from the province of Friezland. The
Flanders horses are much in∣ferior to the former; they have most commonly
large heads, flat feet, and swollen legs; which are an essential
blemish in horses of this kind.</P>
<P>The French horses are of various kinds; but they have few that are
good. The best <PB N="359" REF="377"/> horses of that country come from
Limosin; they have a strong resemblance to the Barb, and, like them, are
excellent for the chace; but they are slow in coming to perfection: they are
to be carefully treated while young, and must not be backed till they are
eight years old. Normandy furnishes the next best; which, though not so
good for the chace, are yet better for war. In general, the French horses
have the fault of being heavy shouldered, which is opposite to the fault of
the Barb, which is too thin in the shoulder, and is, consequently, apt to
be shoulder-slipt.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the horses most usually known in Europe, we
pass on to those of more distant countries, of whose horses we can
only judge by report. We mentioned the wild horses of America. Such as are
tame, if we may credit the latest reports<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa's Voyage, vol. i. p. 464.</BIBL></NOTE>, are
admirable. Great numbers of these are bred up to the chace, and are chiefly
kept for this purpose, particularly at Quito. The hunters, as Ulloa informs
us, are divided into two classes; one part on foot, the other on
horseback: the bu∣siness of the footmen is to rouze the deer; and that of
the horsemen, to hunt it down. They all, at break of day, repair to the place
ap∣pointed, <PB N="360" REF="378"/> which is generally on the summit of an
hill, with every man his greyhound. The horsemen place themselves on the
highest peaks; whilst those on foot range the precipices, mak∣ing an
hideous noise, in order to start the deer. Thus the company extend
themselves three or four leagues, or more, according to their num∣bers. On
starting any game, the horse which first perceives it, sets off, and
the rider, being unable to guide or stop him, pursues the chace,
sometimes down such a steep slope, that a man on foot, with the
greatest care, could hardly keep his legs; from thence he flies up a
danger∣ous ascent, or along the side of a mountain, so that a person
not used to this exercise, would think it much safer to throw himself
out of the saddle, than commit his life to the precipitate ardor of his
horse. The other horses, which join in the chace, do not wait for the
riders to animate them; they set forward immediately upon seeing another at
full speed; and it be∣comes prudence in the rider to give them their way, and
at the same time to let them feel the spur, to carry him over the
precipices. These horses are backed and exercised to this method of
hunting; and their usual pace is trotting.</P>
<P>There are said to be very good horses in the islands of the
Archipelago. Those of Crete <PB N="361" REF="379"/> were in great reputation
among the ancients, for their swiftness and force; however, at pre∣sent
they are but little used, even in the country itself, because of the
unevenness of the ground, which is there very rocky and mountainous. The
original horses of Morocco are much smaller than the Arabian breed;
however, they are very swift and vigorous. In Turky there are to be found
horses of almost all races; Arabians, Tartars, Hungarians, and those
na∣tural to the place. The latter are very beau∣tiful and elegant; they have a
great deal of fire, swiftness, and management; but they are not able to
support fatigue: they eat little; they are easily heated; and they have
skins so sensible, that they can scarcely bear the rubbing of the
stirrup. The Persian horses are, in ge∣neral, the most beautiful and
most valuable of all the east. The pastures in the plains of Media,
Persepolis, Ardebil, and Derbent, are excellent for the purpose of rearing
them; and there were bred in those places vast numbers, by order of the
government of Persia, while that country was under any government. Pietro
della Valle prefers the horses of Persia to those of Italy; and informs
us, that they are in general of a middle size; and although some are found
even of the smallest stature, yet that does not <PB N="362" REF="380"/>
impair their beauty nor their strength: yet, in some places, they are found
of a very good size, and as large as the English saddle-horses are
generally found to be: they have all a thin head, a fine crest, a narrow
breast, small ears well placed, the legs fine, the hoof hard, and the croup
beautiful; they are docile, spi∣rited, nimble, hardy, courageous, and capable
of supporting a very great fatigue; they run very swiftly, without being
easily fatigued; they are strong, and easily nourished, being only
supplied with barley and chopped straw; they are put to grass only for
six weeks in the spring; they have always the tail at full length, and
there is no such thing as geldings among the number; they are defended from
the air, as in England, by body-cloaths; they attend them with the most
punctual exactness; and they are rid generally in a snafflle, without
spurs. Great numbers of these are every year transported into Turky, but
chiefly into the East-Indies: however, after all, travellers agree that they
are not to be compared to the Arabian horses, either for courage, force, or
beauty; and that the latter are greatly sought, even in Persia.</P>
<P>The horses of India are of a very indifferent kind, being weak and
washy. Those which are used by the grandees of the country, come 
<PB N="363" REF="381"/> from Persia and Arabia; they are fed with a small
quantity of hay during the day; and at night they have boiled peas, mixed with
sugar and butter, instead of oats or barley: this nourishment supports
them, and gives them strength; otherwise, they would soon sink and
degenerate, the heat of the climate being against them. Those naturally
belonging to the country, are very small and vicious. Some are so very
little, that Taverner reports, that the young Mogul prince, at the age of
seven or eight, rode one of those little horses, that was not much larger
than a greyhound: and it is not long since one of these was brought over
into this country, as a present to our Queen, that measures no more than
nine hands high; and is not much larger than a common mastiff. It would
seem, that climates excessively hot, are unfavourable to this animal. In
this manner, the horses of the Gold coast, and of Guinea, are extremely
little, but very manageable. It is a common exercise with the grandees of
that country, who are excellent horsemen, to dart out their lances before
them upon full gallop, and to catch them again before they come to the ground.
They have a sport also on horse∣back, that requires great dexterity in
the rider, and a great share of activity in the horse; they 
<PB N="364" REF="382"/> strike off a ball, with a battledore, while they are
upon a full gallop, and pursuing it, strike it again before it comes to the
ground; and this they continue for a mile together, striking sometimes to
the right, and sometimes to the left, with amazing speed and agility.</P>
<P>The horses of China are as indifferent as those of India: they
are weak, little, ill-shaped, and cowardly. Those of Corea are not above
three feet high: almost all the breed there are made geldings, and are so
timorous, that they can be rendered no way serviceable in war; so that it
may be said, that the Tartar horses were pro∣perly the conquerors of China.
These, indeed, are very serviceable in war; and although but of a middle
size, yet they are surprizingly pa∣tient, vigorous, swift, and bold;
their hoofs are extremely hard, though rather too narrow; their heads are fine,
but rather too little; the neck is long and stiff; the legs of the longest;
and yet, with all these faults, they are found to be an excellent breed. The
Tartars live with their horses pretty much in the same manner as the
Arabians do; they begin to back them at the age of seven or eight months,
placing their children upon them, who manage them even at that early age. By
this means they break them, by little and little, till at last, about the age
of <PB N="365" REF="383"/> six or seven years, they are capable of enduring
amazing hardships. Thus they have been known to march two or three days
without once stopping; to continue five or six, without eating any thing
except an handful of grass at every eight hours; and, besides, to remain
without drinking, for four and twenty hours. These horses, which are so
vigorous in their own country, lose all their strength when they are
brought into China or the Indies; but they thrive pretty well in Persia and
Turky. The race of little Tartars towards the north, have also a breed of
little horses, which they set such a value upon, that it is forbidden to
sell them to strangers: these horses have the very same qua∣lities
with those of the larger kind; which they probably derive from a similar
treatment. There are also several very fine horses in Circassia and
Mingrelia. There are some greatly esteemed in the Ukraine, in Walachia,
Poland, and Sweden; but we have no particular accounts of their ex∣cellencies
or defects.</P>
<P>If we consult the ancients on the nature and qualities of the
horses of different countries, we learn, that the Grecian horses, and
particu∣larly those of Thessaly, had the reputation of being excellent
for war; that those of Achaia were the largest that were known; that the
most <PB N="366" REF="384"/> beautiful came from Egypt, which bred great
numbers; that the horses of Ethiopia were not in esteem from the heat of
the country; that Arabia and Afric furnished very beautiful horses, and
very fit for the course; that those of Italy, and particularly of Apulia,
were very good; that in Sicily, Capadocia, Syria, Ar∣menia, Media, and
Persia, there were excellent horses, equally esteemed for their speed
and vi∣gour; that those of Sardinia and Corsica, though small, were
spirited and courageous; that those of Spain resembled the Parthian
horses, in being very well adapted for war; that in Walachia and
Transylvania, there were horses with bushy tails, and manes hanging down
to the ground, which, nevertheless, were extremely swift and active; that
the Danish horses were good leapers; those of Scandinavia, though little,
were well shaped, and possessed of great agility; that the Flanders
breed was strong; that the Gaulish horses were good for carrying
burthens; that the German breeds were so bad, so diminutive, and ill
shaped, that no use could be made of them; that the Swiss and Hungarian
horses were good; and, lastly, that those of India were very diminutive
and feeble.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="385"/>Such are the different accounts we have of the
various races of horses in different parts of the world. I have hitherto
omitted making mention of one particular breed, more excellent than any that
either the ancients or moderns have produced; and that is our own. It is not
without great assiduity, and unceasing appli∣cation, that the English
horses are now become superior to those of any other part of the world,
both for size, strength, swiftness, and beauty. It was not without
great attention, and repeated trials of all the best horses in different
parts of the world, that we have been thus successful in improving the
breed of this animal; so that the English horses are now capable of
performing what no others ever could attain to. By a ju∣dicious mixture of the
several kinds, by the happy difference of our soils, and by our su∣perior
skill in management, we have brought this animal to its highest perfection.
An English horse, therefore, is now known to excel the Arabian, in size
and swiftness; to be more durable than the Barb, and more hardy than the
Persian. An ordinary racer is known to go at the rate of a mile in two
minutes: and we had one instance, in the admirable Childers, of still
greater rapidity. He has been frequently <PB N="368" REF="386"/> known to move
above eighty-two feet and an half in a second, or almost a mile in a
minute: he has run also round the course of New market, which is very
little less than four miles, in six minutes and forty seconds. But what
is surpriz∣ing, no other horse has been since found, that ever could
equal him; and those of his breed have been remarkably deficient.</P>
<P>However this be, no horses can any way equal our own, either in
point of swiftness or strength; and these are the qualifications our
horsemen seem chiefly to value. For this rea∣son, when the French, or
other foreigners, describe our breed, they all mention, as a fault, the
aukward and ungainly motion of our horses; they allow them to be very good
indeed, but they will not grant them an easy or an ele∣gant carriage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Buffon's Account of our Horses.</BIBL></NOTE>.
But these writers do not con∣sider that this seeming want of grace is
entirely the result of our manner of breaking them. We consult only speed
and dispatch in this animal's motions: the French, and other na∣tions, are
more anxious for parade and spirit. For this reason we always throw our
horses forward, while they put them upon their haunches; we give them an
easy swift gait of <PB N="369" REF="387"/> going, that covers a great deal
of ground: they, on the contrary, throw them back, giving them a more shewy
appearance indeed, but one infinitely less useful. The fault of our manner
of breaking is, that the horse is sometimes apt to fall forward; the French
managed horse never falls before, but more usually on one side; and for
this reason, the rider wears stiff boots, to guard his legs against
such accidents. However, it would be a very easy matter to give our
horses all that grace which foreigners are so fond of; but it would
certainly take from their swiftness and durability.</P>
<P>But in what degree of contempt soever foreigners might formerly
have held our horses, they have for some time perceived their error, and
our English hunters are considered as the noblest and the most useful
horses in the world. Our geldings are, therefore, sent over to the
continent in great numbers, and sell at very great prices; as for our mares
and stallions, there is a law prohibiting their exportation; and one
similar to this, obtained even as early as the times of Athelstan, who
prohibited their exportation, except where designed as presents.</P>
<P>Roger de Belegme, created earl of Shrewsbury <PB N="370" REF="388"/> by William the Conqueror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British
Zoology, vol. i. p. 4.</BIBL> To this work I am indebted for several
particulars with regard to the native animals of this island.</NOTE>, is the
first who is recorded to have made attempts towards the mending our native
breed. He introduced Spanish stallions into his estate at Powisland in
Wales, from which that part of the country was for many ages after famous for a
swift and generous race of horses: however, at that time, strength and
swiftness were more regarded than beauty; the horses shapes, in time of
action, being entirely hid by a coat of armour, which the knights then
usually put upon them, either by way of ornament or defence.</P>
<P>The number of our horses, in London alone, in the time of king
Stephen, is said to have amounted to twenty thousand. However, long after,
in the times of queen Elizabeth, the whole kingdom could not supply two
thousand horses to form our cavalry. At present, the former numbers
seem revived; so that, in the late war, we furnished out above thirteen
thou∣sand horsemen: and could, if hard pushed, supply above four times
that number. How far this great encrease of horses among us may be
beneficial, or otherwise, is not the proper <PB N="371" REF="389"/>
business of the present page to discuss; but cer∣tain it is, that
where horses encrease in too great a degree, men must diminish
proportionably; as that food which goes to supply the one, might very
easily be converted into nourish∣ment to serve the other. But, perhaps,
it may be speculating too remotely, to argue for the diminution of their
numbers upon this prin∣ciple, since every manufacture we export into other
countries, takes up room, and may have occupied that place, which, in a state
of greater simplicity, might have given birth and sub∣sistence to
mankind, and have added to popu∣lation.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, as we have been at such expence and trouble to
procure an excellent breed of horses, it is not now to be expected that we
should decline the advantages arising from it, just when in our
possession. It may be, therefore, the most prudent measure in our
legislature, to encourage the breed, as an useful branch of commerce, and a
natural de∣fence to the country. But how far this end is answered by the
breeding up of racers, is what most persons, versed in this subject,
are very apt to question. They assert, that the running-horse, as the
breed has been for a long time re∣fined, <PB N="372" REF="390"/> is unfit for
any other service than that of the course, being too slight either for
the road, the chace, or the combat; and his joints so de∣licately united, as
to render him subject to the smallest accidents. They, therefore,
con∣clude, that less encouragement given to racing, would be a means of
turning us from breeding rather for swiftness than strength; and that we
should thus be again famous for our strong hunters, which they say are
wearing out from among us.</P>
<P>How far this may be fact, I will not take upon me to determine,
being but little versed in a subject that does not properly come within the
compass of natural history. Instead, there∣fore, of farther expatiating
on this well known animal's qualifications, upon which many vo∣lumes might
easily be written, I will content myself with just mentioning the
description of Camerarius, in which he professes to unite all the
perfections which an horse ought to be possessed of. 
<Q REND="inline">"It must," says he, "have three parts like
those of a woman; the breast must be broad, the hips round, and the mane
long: it must, in three things resemble a lion; its coun∣tenance must be
fierce, its courage must be great, and its fury irresistible: it must
have <PB N="373" REF="391"/> three things belonging to the sheep; the nose,
gentleness, and patience: it must have three of a deer; head, leg, and
skin: it must have three of a wolf; throat, neck, and hearing: it must
have three of a fox; ear, tail, and trot: three of a serpent; memory,
sight, and flexi∣bility: and, lastly, three of an hare; running, walking,
and perseverance."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Of the Ass.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many parts of
this account are extracted from Dau∣benton and Buffon; which I mention here, to
avoid troubling the reader with a multiplicity of quotations.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH this animal is very easily distinguished from the
horse at first sight, yet, upon a closer inspection, the similitude
between them is very striking. They have both a similar outline in the
external parts; the same confor∣mation within. One would be led, from the
great resemblance there is between them, to suppose them of the same
species; and that the ass was only an horse degenerated: however, they
are perfectly distinct, and there is an in∣separable line drawn between
them, for the mule they produce is barren. This seems to be the barrier
between every species of animals; this keeps them asunder, and preserves
the unities of their form. If the mule, or the monster bred between two
animals whose form nearly approaches, is no longer fertile, we may then
conclude, that these animals, however resembling, are of different
kinds.—Nature has providently stopped the fruitfulness of these
ill-formed productions, in order to pre∣serve <PB N="375" REF="393"/> the form
of every animal unconta∣minated: were it not for this, the races would quickly
be mixed with each other; no one kind would preserve its original perfection;
every creature would quickly degenerate; and the world would be stocked with
imperfection and deformity.</P>
<P>The horse and the ass, therefore, though so nearly approaching
in form, are of two distinct kinds, different in their natures; and were
there but one of each kind, both races would then be extinguished. Their
shapes and their habits may, indeed, be very nearly alike; but there is
something in every animal, beside its confor∣mation or way of life, that
determines its spe∣cific nature. Thus there is much greater re∣semblance
between the horse and the ass, than between the sheep and the goat; and
yet the latter produce an animal that is by no means barren, but which quickly
re produces an off∣spring resembling the sheep; while the mule of the
former is marked with certain sterility. The goat and the sheep may be
therefore said to be of one kind, although so much unlike in figure; while
the horse and the ass are perfectly di∣stinct, though so closely
resembling. It has, indeed, been said by Aristotle, that their male is
sometimes prolific; this, however, has not <PB N="376" REF="394"/> been
confirmed by any other testimony, al∣though there has elapsed a period of
near two thousand years to collect the evidence.</P>
<P>But what tends to put the subject out of dis∣pute is, that the
two animals are found in a state of nature, entirely different. The onager,
or wild ass, is seen in still greater abundance than the wild horse;
and the peculiarities of its kind are more distinctly marked than in those
of the tame one. Had it been an horse dege∣nerated, the likeness would be
stronger between them, the higher we went to the original stock from whence
both have been supposed to be sprung. The wild animals of both kinds
would, in such a case, resemble each other, much more than those of the
tame kind, upon whom art has, for a succession of ages, been
ex∣ercising all its force, and producing strange habits and new
alterations. The contrary how∣ever obtains, and the wild ass is even more
assinine, if I may so express it, than that bred in a state of
domestic servitude; and has even a natural aversion to the horse, as
the reader will shortly learn.</P>
<P>The wild ass has, by some writers, been con∣founded with the
zebra, but very improperly, for they are of a very different species. The
wild ass is not streaked like the zebra, nor is his <PB N="377" REF="395"/>
shape so beautiful: his figure is pretty much the same as that of the
common ass, except that he is of a brighter colour, and has a white list
running from his head to his tail. This animal is found wild in many islands
of the Archipelago, particularly in that of Cerigo. There are many wild
asses in the desarts of Lybia and Numidia, that run with such amaz∣ing
swiftness, that scarce even the coursers of the country can overtake
them. When they see a man, they set up an horrid braying, and stop
short all together, till he approaches near them; they then, as if by common
consent, fly off with great speed; and it is upon such oc∣casions that
they generally fall into the traps which are previously prepared to catch
them. The natives take them chiefly upon account of their flesh, which they
esteem as delicious eating; and for their skins, of which that kind of
leather is made which is called shagreen.</P>
<P>Olearius relates that the monarch of Persia invited him on a
certain day to be present at an entertainment of a very peculiar nature,
which was exhibited in a small building near the palace, resembling a
theatre. After a col∣lation of fruits and sweetmeats, more than thirty of
these wild asses were driven into the area, among which the monarch
discharged <PB N="378" REF="396"/> several shot, and some arrows, and in
which he was imitated by some of the rest of his attend∣ants. The
asses, finding themselves wounded, and no way of escaping, instantly
began to at∣tack each other, biting with great fierceness, and braying
terribly. In this manner they con∣tinued their mutual animosity, while the
arrows were poured in from above, until they were all killed; upon which they
were ordered to be taken, and sent to the king's kitchen at Ispahan. The
Persians esteem the flesh of this animal so highly, that its delicacy
is even become a pro∣verb among them. What may be the taste of the wild
asses flesh, we are unable to say; but certain it is, that the flesh
of the tame ass is the worst that can be obtained, being dryer, more tough,
and more disagreeable than even horse-flesh. Galen even says that it is
very unwhol∣some. Yet we should not judge hastily upon the different
tastes of different people, in the preference they give to certain meats. The
climate produces very great changes in the tenderness and the favour of
several viands: that beef, for instance, which is so juicy and good in
England, is extremely tough and dry when killed under the line; on the
contrary, that pork which is with us so unpalatable in summer, in the
warmer latitudes, where it is <PB N="379" REF="397"/> always hotter than here,
is the finest eating they have, and much preferable to any hog's flesh in
Europe.</P>
<P>The ass, like the horse, was originally im∣ported into America
by the Spaniards, and after∣wards by other nations. That country seems to
have been peculiarly favourable to this race of animals; and, where they have
run wild, they have multiplied in such numbers, that in some places they
are become a nuisance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p.
316.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the kingdom of Quito, the owners of the grounds where
they are bred, suffer all persons to take away as many as they can, on
paying a small acknowledgment, in proportion to the number of days their
sport lasts. They catch them in the following manner. A number of persons
go on horseback, and are attended by Indians on foot: when arrived at the
proper places, they form a circle in order to drive them into some valley;
where, at full speed, they throw the noose, and endeavour to halter them.
Those creatures, finding themselves inclosed, make very furious efforts
to escape; and, if only one forces his way through, they all follow with an
irresistible impetuosity. However, when noosed, the hunters throw them
down and se∣cure them with fetters, and thus leave them <PB N="380" REF="398"/> till the chace is over. Then, in order to bring them away with
greater facility, they pair them with tame beasts of the same kind; but
this is not easily performed, for they are so remark∣ably fierce that they
often hurt the persons who undertake to manage them. They have all the
swiftness of horses, and neither declivities nor precipices can retard
their career. When attacked, they defend themselves with their heels and
mouth with such activity, that, with∣out flackening their pace, they often
maim their pursuers. But the most remarkable pro∣perty in these creatures
is, that after carrying their first load, their celerity leaves them, their
dangerous ferocity is loft, and they soon con∣tract the stupid look and
dullness peculiar to the assinine species. It is also observable,
that these creatures will not permit an horse to live among them. They
always feed together; and, if an horse happens to stray into the place
where they graze, they all fall upon him; and, without giving him the liberty
of flying, they bite and kick him till they leave him dead upon the spot.</P>
<P>Such is this animal in its natural state, swift, fierce, and
formidable; but, in his state of tameness, the ass presents a very
different pic∣ture; the moment his native liberty is repressed, 
<PB N="381" REF="399"/> he seems entirely to give up all claims to free∣dom;
and he assumes a patience and submis∣sion even humbler than his
situation. He is, in a state of tameness, the most gentle and quiet of
all animals. He suffers with constancy, and, perhaps, with courage, all the
ill treat∣ment that cruelty and caprice are pleased to inflict. He is
temperate with regard to the quantity and the quality of his provision. He is
contented with the most neglected weeds; and makes his humble repast upon
what the horse and other animals leave behind. If he gives the preference to
any vegetable, it is to the plantane; for which he is often seen to neglect
every other herb in the pasture: but he is chiefly delicate with respect to
his water; he drinks only at the clearest brooks, and chiefly those to
which he has been accustomed. He drinks as soberly as he eats; and never,
like the horse, dips his nose into the stream. As he is seldom
saddled, he frequently rolls him∣self upon the grass; and lies down, for
this purpose, as often as he has an opportunity, without minding what becomes
of his burthen. He never rolls, like the horse, in the mud; he even fears to
wet his feet; and turns out of his way to avoid the dirty parts of a road.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="400"/>When very young, the ass is sprightly, and
even tolerably handsome; but he soon loses these qualifications, either
by age or bad treat∣ment, and he becomes slow, stupid, and head∣strong.
He seems to shew no ardour, except for the female, having been often known
to die after the covering. The she-ass is not less fond of her young than
the male is of her; and we are assured that she will cross fire and
water to protect, or rejoin it. This animal is sometimes not less attached
to his owner; by whom he is too often abused. He scents him at a
distance, and distinguishes him from others in a crowd; he knows the ways
he has passed and the places where he inhabits.</P>
<P>When over-loaded, the ass shews the injustice of his master,
by hanging down his head and lowering his ears; when he is too hard
pressed, he opens his mouth and draws back his lips in a very
disagreeable manner. If his eyes are covered, he will not stir a step;
and, if he is laid down in such a manner that one eye is covered with the
grass while the other is hidden with a stone, or whatever is next at hand,
he will continue fixed in the same situation, and will not so much as
attempt to rise to free himself from those slight impediments. He
walks, trots, <PB N="383" REF="401"/> and gallops like an horse; but, although
he sets out very freely at first, yet he is soon tired; and then no
beating will make him mend his pace. It is in vain that his unmerciful rider
exerts his whip or his cudgel; the poor little animal bears it all with
patience, and without a groan; and, conscious of his own imbecility, does not
offer even to move.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the stupid heaviness of his air, he may be
educated with as much ease as any other animal; and several have been
brought up to perform, and exhibited as a shew. In general, however, the poor
animal is entirely neglected. Man despises this humble useful creature,
whose efforts are exerted to please him, and whose services are too
cheaply purchased. The horse is the only favourite, and upon him alone all
expence and labour are bestowed. He is fed, attended, and stabled, while
the ass is abandoned to the cruelty of the lowest rustics, or even to the
sport of children, and, instead of gaining by the lessons he receives,
is always a loser. He is conducted along by blows; he is insulted by
unnecessary stripes; he is overloaded by the lazy; and, being ge∣nerally
the property of the poor, he shares with them in their wants and their
distresses. Thus this faithful animal, which, were there no 
<PB N="384" REF="402"/> horses, would be the first of the quadrupede kind in
our esteem, is now considered as no∣thing; his properties and
qualifications being found in an higher degree elsewhere, he is en∣tirely
disregarded; and, from being the second, he is degraded into one of the
most useless of the domestic quadrupedes.</P>
<P>For this reason, very little care has been taken to improve the
breed; it is suffered to degenerate; and it is probable, that of all other
animals this alone is rendered feebler and more diminutive, by being in a
state of domestic ser∣vitude. The horse, the cow, and the sheep, are
rendered larger by the assiduity of man; the ass is suffered to dwindle
every generation, and particularly in England, where it is probable that, but
for the medicinal qualities of its milk, the whole species would have ere now
been ex∣tinguished. Nevertheless, we have good reasons to believe that,
were the same care bestowed on the ass that is spent upon the horse,
were the same industry used in crossing the breed and improving it,
we should see the ass become from his present mean state, a very
portly and serviceable animal; we should find him rival the horse in
some of his perfections, and exceed him in others. The ass, bulk for bulk,
is stronger than the horse; he is more sure footed <PB N="385" REF="403"/>
also; and, though more slow in his motions, he is much less apt to
start out of the way.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, of all people in Europe, seem alone to be
acquainted With the value of the ass. They take all proper precautions to
improve the breed; and I have seen a jack-ass, from that country, above
fifteen hands high. This animal, however, seems originally a na∣tive of
Arabia. A warm climate is known to produce the largest and the best; their
size and spirit decline in proportion as they advance into colder
regions.</P>
<P>Though now so common in all parts of Eng∣land, the ass was
entirely lost amongst us during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Holingshed
in∣forms us that our land did yield no asses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology, vol. i. p. 11.</BIBL></NOTE>. However,
there are accounts of their being common in England before that time. In
Sweden, they are at present a sort of rarity; nor does it appear by the
last history of Nor∣way that they have yet reached that country. It is in
the hotter climates alone that we are to look for the original of this
serviceable creature. In Guinea, they are larger and more beautiful than even
the horses of the same country. In Persia, they have two kinds; one of
which is <PB N="386" REF="404"/> used for burthens, being slow and heavy;
the other, which is kept for the saddle, being smooth, stately, and
nimble. They are ma∣naged as horses, only that the rider fits nearer the
crupper, and they are taught to amble like them. They generally cleave their
nostrils to give them more room for breathing, and many of these are sold
for forty or fifty pounds.</P>
<P>The ass is a much more healthy animal than the horse, and liable
to fewer diseases. Of all animals covered with hair, he is the least
sub∣ject to vermin, for he has no lice, probably owing to the dryness and
the hardness of his skin. Like the horse, he is three or four years in
coming to perfection; he lives till twenty or twenty-five; sleeps much less
than the horse; and never lies down for that purpose, unless very much
tired. The she-ass goes above eleven months with young, and never brings
forth more than one at a time. The mule may be engendered either between an
horse or a she-ass, or between a jack-ass and a mare. The latter breed
is every way preferable, being larger, stronger, and better shaped. It is
not yet well known whether the animal called the Gimerro be one of these
kinds; or, as is as∣serted, bred between the ass and the bull. While 
<PB N="387" REF="405"/> naturalists affirm the impossibility of this
mix∣ture, the natives of the Alpine countries, where this animal is bred, as
strongly insist upon its reality. The common mule is very healthy, and
will live above thirty years, being found very serviceable in carrying
burthens, particularly in mountainous and stony places, where horses are
not so sure footed. The size and strength of our asses is at
present greatly im∣proved by the importation of Spanish jack∣asses; and
it is probable we may come in time to equal the Spaniards in breeding them,
where it is not uncommon to give fifty or sixty guineas for a mule; and,
indeed, in some mountainous countries, the inhabitants cannot well do
with∣out them. Their manner of going down the precipices of the Alps, or the
Andes, is very extraordinary; and with it we will conclude their history. In
these passages, on one side, are steep eminences, and, on the other,
fright∣ful abysses; and, as they generally follow the direction of the
mountain, the road, instead of lying in a level, forms at every little
distance steep declivities, of several hundred yards downward. These
can only be descended by mules; and the animal itself seems sensible
of the danger, and the caution that is to be used <PB N="388" REF="406"/> in
such descents. When they come to the edge of one of these descents,
they stop of themselves, without being checked by the rider; and, if he
inadvertently attempts to spur them on, they continue immoveable. They seem
all this time ruminating on the danger that lies before them, and preparing
themselves for the en∣counter. They not only attentively view the road, but
tremble and snort at the danger. Having prepared for the descent, they
place their fore-feet in a posture, as if they were stopping themselves;
they then also put their hinder feet together, but a little forward, as if
they were going to lie down. In this atti∣tude, having taken as it were a
survey of the road, they slide down with the swiftness of a meteor. In
the mean time, all the rider has to do is to keep himself fast on the
saddle, with∣out checking the rein, for the least motion is sufficient to
disorder the equilibrium of the mule; in which case they both unavoidably
perish. But their address, in this rapid de∣scent, is truly wonderful;
for, in their swiftest motion, when they seem to have lost all
go∣vernment of themselves, they follow exactly the different windings of the
road, as if they had previously settled in their minds the route 
<PB N="389" REF="407"/> they were to follow, and taken every precau∣tion for
their safety. In this journey, the na∣tives, who are placed along the sides
of the mountains, and hold by the roots of the trees, animate the beasts with
shouts, and encourage him to perseverance. Some mules, after being long
used to these journeys, acquire a kind of reputation for their safety and
skill; and their value rises in proportion to their fame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="390" REF="408"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the Zebra.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are but three animals of the horse kind. The horse, which
is the most stately and courageous; the ass, which is the most pa∣tient
and humble; and the zebra, which is the most beautiful, but at the same
time the wildest animal in nature. Nothing can exceed the delicate regularity
of this creature's colour, or the lustrous smoothness of its skin; but,
on the other hand, nothing can be more timid or more untameable.</P>
<P>It is chiefly a native of the southern parts of Africa; and there
are whole herds of them often seen feeding in those extensive plains that
lie towards the Cape of Good Hope. How∣ever, their watchfulness is such,
that they will suffer nothing to come near them; and their swiftness so
great, that they readily leave every pursuer far behind. The zebra, in
shape, rather resembles the mule, than the horse, or the ass. It is
rather less than the former, and yet larger than the latter. Its ears are not
so long as those of the ass, and yet not so small as in the horse
kind. Like the ass, its head is large, its back <PB N="391" REF="409"/>
straight, its legs finely placed, and its tail tufted at the end; like the
horse, its skin is smooth and close, and its hind quarters round and
fleshy. But its greatest beauty lies in the amazing regularity and elegance
of its colours. In the male, they are white and brown; in the female, white and
black. These colours are disposed in alternate stripes over the whole
body, and with such exactness and symmetry, that one would think Nature
had employed the rule and compass to paint them. These stripes, which,
like so many ribbands, are laid all over its body, are narrow, parallel, and
exactly se∣parated from each other. It is not here as in other party coloured
animals, where the tints are blended into each other; every stripe here is
perfectly distinct, and preserves its colour round the body, or the limb,
without any di∣minution. In this manner are the head, the body, the thighs, the
legs, and even the tail and the ears beautifully streaked, so that at a
little distance one would be apt to suppose that the animal was
dressed out by art, and not thus admirably adorned by nature.</P>
<P>In the male zebra, the head is striped with fine bands of black
and white, which in a man∣ner center in the forehead. The ears are va∣riegated
with a white and dusky brown. The <PB N="392" REF="410"/> neck has broad
stripes of the same dark brown running round it, leaving narrow white
stripes between. The body is striped also across the back with broad
bands, leaving narrower spaces of white between them, and ending in points at
the sides of the belly, which is white, except a black line pectinated on
each side, reaching from between the fore-legs, along the middle of the
belly, two thirds of its length. There is a line of separation between the
trunk of the body and the hinder quarters, on each side; behind which, on the
rump, is a plat of narrow stripes, joined together, by a stripe down the
middle, to the end of the tail. The colours are different in the female; and in
none the stripes seem entirely to agree in form, but in all they are
equally distinct; the hair equally smooth and fine; the white shining and
unmixed; and the black, or brown, thick and lustrous.</P>
<P>Such is the beauty of this creature, that it seems by nature
fitted to satisfy the pride and the pleasure of man; and formed to be taken
into his service. Hitherto, however, it appears to have disdained
servitude, and neither force nor kindness have been able to wean it from
its native independance and fe∣rocity. But this wildness might, perhaps, in 
<PB N="393" REF="411"/> time, be surmounted; and, it is probable, the horse
and the ass, when first taken from the forest, were equally obstinate,
fierce, and un∣manageable, Mr. Buffon informs us that the zebra, from which he
took his description, could never be entirely mastered, notwithstand∣ing
all the efforts which were tried to tame it. They continued, indeed to mount
it, but then with such precautions as evidently shewed its fierceness,
for two men were obliged to hold the reins while the third ventured upon its
back; and even then it attempted to kick whenever it perceived any person
approaching. That which is now in the Queen's menagerie, at Buckingham Gate, is
even more vicious than the former; and the keeper who shews it takes care to
inform the spectators of its ungovernable nature. Upon my attempting to
approach, it seemed quite terrified, and was preparing to kick, appearing as
wild as if just caught, although taken extremely young, and used with the
utmost indulgence. Yet still it is most probable that this animal, by
time and assiduity, could be brought under subjection. As it resembles
the horse in form, without all doubt it has a similitude of nature, and
only requires the efforts of an industrious and skilful nation to be added
to the number of our do∣mestics. <PB N="394" REF="412"/> It is not now known
what were the pains and the dangers which were first under∣gone to reclaim
the breed of horses from savage ferocity; these, no doubt, made an equal
op∣position; but, by being opposed, by an in∣dustrious and enterprizing
race of mankind, their spirit was at last subdued, and their free∣dom
restrained. It is otherwise with regard to the zebra; it is the native of
countries where the human inhabitants are but little raised above the
quadrupede. The natives of Angola, or Cafraria, have no other idea of advantage
from horses but as they are good for food; neither the fine stature of the
Arabian courser, nor the delicate colourings of the zebra, have any
al∣lurements to a race of people who only consider the quantity of flesh
and not its conformation. The delicacy of the zebra's shape, or the painted
elegance of its form, are no more regarded by such, than by the lion that
makes it his prey. For this reason, therefore, the zebra may hitherto have
continued wild, because it is the native of a country where there have been
no successive efforts made to reclaim it. All pursuits that have been
hitherto instituted against it, were rather against its life than its
liberty; the animal has thus been long taught to consider man as its most
mortal enemy; and <PB N="395" REF="413"/> it is not to be wondered that it
refuses to yield obedience where it has so seldom experienced mercy.
There is a kind of knowledge in all animals, that I have often considered
with amazement; which is, that they seem perfectly to know their enemies, and
to avoid them. Instinct, indeed, may teach the deer to fly from the lion; or
the mouse to avoid the cat: but what is the principle that teaches the dog to
attack the dog-butcher wherever he sees him? In China, where the killing and
dressing dogs is a trade, whenever one of these people move out, all the
dogs of the village, or the street, are sure to be after him. This I
should hardly have believed, but that I have seen more than one instance
of it among ourselves. I have seen a poor fellow who made a practice of
steal∣ing and killing dogs for their skins, pursued hue and cry for three
or four streets together, by all the bolder breed of dogs, while the weaker
flew from his presence with affright. How these animals could thus find out
their enemy, and pursue him, appears I own unac∣countable, but such is the
fact; and it not only obtains in dogs, but in several other animals, though
perhaps to a less degree. This very probably may have been, in some
measure, a <PB N="396" REF="414"/> cause that has hitherto kept the zebra in
its state of natural wildness; and in which it may continue, till kinder
treatment shall have re∣conciled it to its pursuers.</P>
<P>It is very likely, therefore, as a more civi∣lized people are now
placed at the Cape of Good Hope, which is the chief place where this animal is
found, that we may have them tamed and rendered serviceable. Nor is its
extraordinary beauty the only motive we have for wishing this animal among
the number of our dependents; its swiftness is said to surpass that
of all others; so that the speed of a zebra is become a proverb among the
Spaniards and Portuguese. It stands better upon its legs also than an
horse; and is consequently stronger in proportion. Thus, if by proper
care we im∣proved the breed, as we have in other in∣stances, we should
probably in time to come have a race as large as the horse, as fleet, as
strong, and much more beautiful.</P>
<P>The zebra, as was said, is chiefly a native of the Cape of Good
Hope. It is also found in the kingdom of Angola; and, as we are assured
by Lopez, in several provinces also of Barbary. In those boundless
forests it has nothing to re∣strain its liberty; it is too shy to be
caught in <PB N="397" REF="415"/> traps, and therefore seldom taken alive. It
would seem, therefore, that none of them have ever been brought into Europe,
that were caught sufficiently young, so as to be un∣tinctured by their
original state of wildness. The Portuguese, indeed, pretend that they
have been able to tame them, and that they have sent four from Africa to
Lisbon, which were so far brought under as to draw the king's coach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dapper.</BIBL></NOTE>; they add, that the person who
sent them over, had the office of notary conferred upon him for his reward,
which was to remain to him and his posterity for ever: but I do not find this
confirmed by any person who says he saw them. Of those which were
sent to Brasil, not one could be tamed; they would permit one man only to
approach them; they were tied up very short; and one of them, which had by
some means got loose, actually killed his groom, having bitten him to
death<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pyrard. tom. ii. p.
376.</BIBL></NOTE>. Notwithstanding this, I believe, were the zebra taken up
suffici∣ently young, and properly treated, it might be rendered as tame as
any other animal; and Me∣rolla, who saw many of them, asserts, that when
tamed, which he speaks of as being common enough, they are not less
estimable for their swiftness than their beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="416"/>This animal, which is neither to be found in
Europe, Asia, or America, is nevertheless very easily fed. That which
came over into Eng∣land some years ago, would eat almost any thing, such
as bread, meat, and tobacco; that which is now among us, subsists
entirely upon hay. As it so nearly resembles the horse and the ass in
structure, so it probably brings forth annually as they do. The noise
they make is neither like that of an horse or an ass, but more resembling
the confused barking of a mastiff dog. In the two which I saw, there was
a circumstance that seems to have escaped naturalists; which is, that
the skin hangs loose below the jaw upon the neck, in a kind of dewlap,
which takes away much from the general beauty. But whether this be a natural or
accidental blemish, I will not take upon me to determine.</P>
<P>These animals are often sent as presents to the princes of the
east. We are told, that one of the governors of Batavia gave a zebra, which
had been sent to him from Africa, to the emperor of Japan, for which he
received as an equivalent for the company, a present, to the value of sixty
thousand crowns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Navendorf.</BIBL></NOTE>.
