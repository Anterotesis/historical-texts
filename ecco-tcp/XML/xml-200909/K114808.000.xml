<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE vast Number of Books which the Pen and Press have
produced, has made all Lovers of Literature desirous of knowing, by some
compendious Me∣thods, what has been written in the several Sciences to which
they have appropriated their Studies: And this Desire grows more importunate,
as the Difficulty encreases of satisfying it; the Works of the Learned
multiplying so much beyond the Accounts which are given of them, and our
Attention being engrossed to the Regard only of <HI>some</HI> few
Writers, by those very means, which might be used to give us a tolerable
notice of <HI>all,</HI> who any ways deserve it.</P>
<P>For several Attempts have indeed been made, in many Countries,
to gratify in some measure, this universal Cu∣riosity; but in
<HI>England,</HI> especially, by such narrow and cir∣cumscribed Schemes,
as have left many Impediments to the Advancement of human Knowledge unremov'd.
For thro' the Defect of such Intelligence, in its proper Extent; how many
AUTHORS have we, who are consuming their Time, their Quiet and their Wits, in
searching after that which is either past finding, or already found? In
admiring at the Penetrations themselves have made, tho' to the Rind only, in
those very Branches of Science which their Fore∣fathers have pierced to the
Pith? And how many, who <HI>would be</HI> Authors, as excellent as ever
appear'd, had they but such Plans or Models laid before them, as might induce
them to marshal their Thoughts into a regular Order; or did they but know
where to meet with Concurrence of Opinion, with Arguments, Authorities or
Examples, to corroborate and ripen their teeming Conceptions?</P>
<P>Again, had such Intelligence been dispersed in its due Scope
and Latitude, how many BOOKSELLERS, who would neither <HI>be impos'd</HI> upon
themselves, with mere Transcripts <PB N="ii" REF="13"/> of obsolete and
obscure Works, for modern Compositions, nor <HI>impose upon others,</HI>
so much to the Discredit of their Trade, and, in the main, to their own
Disadvantage, either such injudicious Valuations of some old Books, or
so many im∣mature Publications of new ones; when the same Subjects are
already more significantly handled at their very Elbows, but mourning in a
kind of Sackloth and Ashes, for that Re∣vival, they might at a much easier
Expence, be preferr'd to; knew the Possessors but where, even in their
own Shops to find them? Nor yet would they <HI>impose upon themselves</HI>
the Losses they often so voluntarily do, of turning those very Pieces
to Waste-paper, which to some Reader or other would be most acceptable,
knew the one how to <HI>communicate,</HI> and the other, how to
<HI>compass</HI> the <HI>Contents</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>Lastly, how many READERS, who would not be glad of attaining to
Knowledge the shortest way, seeing the Orb thereof is swoln to such a
Magnitude, and Life but such a Span to grasp it? How many, who have not
some Curiosity to know the Foundations of those Tenets upon which they
so securely trust their Understandings? Or where the Foot∣steps of
those Precepts and Precedents may be found, which have given Direction to
so many modern Performances? Who would not embrace the most likely means to
detect the vile Grievance of Plagiarism, and deter so many
disad∣vantageous Repetitions of the same thing? What Reader would not think
it convenient to be apprized of the Worth of Authors, before he gave them place
in his Study or Esteem, by some previous Characters or little Analysis of
what is comprized in them? And who would not find it commo∣dious to have the
opportunity of revising the Library of which he is, he has been, or may be
possess'd, in faithful Portraits thereof, at such Times and Places in
which he cannot come at the Originals? In a word, if he be ignorant, who would
not covet to enlarge his Knowledge? If he be knowing, who would not willingly
refresh his Memory? And yet all the Expedients we have to accommodate the
Cu∣rious with so many <HI>Desiderata,</HI> are only some superficial
<HI>Catalogues,</HI> either of Authors, rather than their Works, or of the
Works of Authors only, in some one peculiar place of Education, or in some
single Science; or else, those which have been most cursorily taken
of some particular Libraries; and also a few <HI>Extracts,</HI> limited to
the Recom∣mendation only of some modern Writers.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="14"/>As for our CATALOGUES of Books, they are
generally, and indeed necessarily, thro' the great Charge and Hurry which
attend the making and printing them at proper Junc∣tures, so short and
defective, that we cannot often under∣stand, by the two or three Words they
bestow upon a Vo∣lume, the very Title, nor sometimes the Size, nor
frequently the Time when it was printed, much less the Matter treated of
therein: So that many Gentlemen, who live remote from the Places where our
Sales and Auctions are made, are, by the blind and doubtful Informations which
these Cata∣logues afford them, both led to over-look some Books which they
have most occasion for, and to give Commissions for the Purchase of
others, by which they are utterly disappointed, as answering in no wise
their Expectation. Nay, many who have Opportunities even of being present
where such Libra∣ries are disposed of, do still, after Examination,
commonly meet with no less Disappointment. For the bare and naked
<HI>Titles</HI> of Books, especially so contracted, are insufficient to
explain them at best, or when their Contents are ingenuously design'd to
be signified by the Titles; but, on the contrary, the Titles of many are
often mere Paradoxes, Enigmas, and even Contrarieties to the Subjects or
Arguments maintained in them; and are so disguised, many times, thro'
Artifice, by the Authors, Editors, and Booksellers themselves, to de∣ceive
the Purchaser, and catch him by the Purse. This Deceit will last as long
as Books, if the other Expedient of <HI>Extracts</HI> is not more effectually
put in execution, than it has hitherto been done.</P>
<P>For EXTRACTS indeed would have prevented all these
In∣conveniencies, had they been employ'd in a Scheme, only as comprehensive,
as it is obvious to be suggested. But tho' it is above fifty Years since
such Extracts of Books were first publish'd in <HI>England,</HI> yet do
all, or the greatest part which have been here made, respect only the Works
of a few con∣temporary Writers; as if it were a shame not to be ungrateful,
and trample those Predecessors into Oblivion, by the help of whose
Learning and Abilities, the Moderns have improved their own. But this is a very
partial and pernicious kind of Flattery, so to celebrate and compliment the
Learning and Genius of the present Times, that Posterity may not believe
any before them worthy of their notice: For those who ex∣tend not their
Knowledge beyond their own Age, must not only lose the noblest
Inheritance of their Ancestors, but in∣struct their Successors to
imitate their Example, and deal <PB N="iv" REF="15"/> the same measure to
the <HI>present,</HI> which these have dealt to the <HI>past.</HI></P>
<P>For these Reasons, and many others, in which an intelli∣gent
Reader might forestall us, we think it high time to be∣gin with an
Undertaking which may include both those Ex∣pedients to their full Advantage,
in a <HI>Catalogue</HI> more com∣plete, as to the <HI>Titles</HI> of Books,
which alone would be no inconsiderable Improvement upon what has been done,
and an <HI>Extract</HI> more unlimited, as to the Times in which they were
written, than have hitherto appear'd among us; so as to facilitate the most
useful Researches of the Living, by a general Register of, or Directory
to the most notable Particulars in the Labours of the Dead.</P>
<P>And the more directly to prosecute this Attempt, it is
comprehended under the Title of the BRITISH LIBRARIAN: For not only because
Matters of our own Observation are generally most applicable to us, or
because the running into Books of all Countries, would make it a Work of
which we could never hope to see any End, or tolerable Progress; but
chiefly because our Pains and Respect are principally due to our own
Country; because also such Service thereunto has been most neglected;
and because the Language thereof is most extensively useful to our own
People, we shall confine our∣selves to our own Authors; and some indeed
of those Fo∣reigners likewise, who are either become as it were
natura∣liz'd among us, by Translations, or have deserved to be so, by
treating of <HI>English</HI> Affairs.</P>
<P>By calling this Work of our LIBRARIAN a <HI>compendious
Review</HI> or <HI>Abstract,</HI> we propose not always a minute and entire
Epitome of every Book, which would make a Scheme of this Compass so tedious
and voluminous, that we know not whether our Readers or ourselves would be
first wearied in going thro' it. Besides, excellent Authors, so serv'd,
would never satisfy curious Readers; and those Authors who cannot claim
that Character, would either not deserve such distinction, or not be
suffer'd, by the Attention which others, equally deserving, would also
demand, to exact such par∣ticular Cognizance, in a Work of such a general
Nature. Our Business therefore cannot be so much to delight Read∣ers with
the Flowers of Books, or satisfy them with a smooth Contexture of all the
Reasons and Arguments in them, as to point out those Heads or Topicks,
which, like so many Streams and Rivulets that severally arise in the
Provinces of Literature, may best direct them to the Fountains them∣selves,
<PB N="v" REF="16"/> where every Reader will extract those Parts, and those
Proportions, which no Epitomist can do for him. So that by this Compendium of
Hints and Advertisements concerning the most observable Persons and
Places, Times and Things, which have been spoken of in the Writings of Men,
is intended a <HI>Promptuary</HI> only, to the Search of those Writings, as
the most ready means to expedite the Attain∣ment of what every one is
seeking. For as the excellent Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> complains, 
<Q REND="inline">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Augment.
Scientiarum, Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 5.</BIBL></NOTE>learned Men want such
<HI>Inven∣tories</HI> of every thing in Art and Nature, as rich Men have of
their Estates."</Q> Here then, we hope to supply that Want, by giving not
only such Inventories of all those things, but, at the same time, a
Reference to the Observa∣tions in their Authors which have been further made
on them; and not only that, but oftentimes what has been ob∣served even of
the Authors also. And this more expresly, after presenting first of all
their Titles, commonly at length, in a manner as agreeably diversified as the
Authors will con∣veniently permit; sometimes with Reasons for the Choice of
them; a transient View of the Drift or Design, and Con∣tents of those we
revive; some Notice of their Vouchers and Authorities; some Sketches of
their chief Arguments or Examples; some Indication of their Method, and
Instances of their Stile, occasionally, as they yield Matter most likely
to be serviceable; with Characters also sometimes subjoin'd, which
others have given of them. And in this treatment of good old Authors, we hope
for the same effect, as in the pruning of good old Trees, in which the
Gardener does not pride himself with the Twigs which he cuts off, or throws
together, but expects that the Operation will be a means of making the Stocks
themselves, from whence they grew, shoot forth with fresh Vigour, and
reward, with better Fruits, the Hands that shall gather them.</P>
<P>By our most <HI>Scarce, Useful, and Valuable</HI> Books in all
Sciences, we intend the most considerable of all Times, from the most
Ancient we can procure, to the most Modern, in all Sizes, even Pamphlets as
well as bound Volumes. And here our Scheme is so copious as to admit not only
of many which have been long buried in Darkness by their great Age, but
some, in a manner so young, as never yet to have seen the Light of
Publication, being only in the Press, or but going to it; and that, in a
Method, as may be hence gather'd, more satisfactory than they are usually
notified to the Pub∣lick. <PB N="vi" REF="17"/> And because we have received
hopes from some emi∣nent and judicious Persons, who approve of this
Undertak∣ing, that we shall be favour'd from time to time with several
useful <HI>Manuscripts</HI> which have long lain disregarded, we
propose to enrich our Collections with a short Account also of one or
more in every Number.</P>
<P>For as to the <HI>Method of Publication,</HI> we find it most
com∣modious, that we may better admit the Communications of such as please
to oblige us with their Correspondence, that it should be <HI>Monthly,</HI>
and in such a <HI>miscellaneous</HI> manner as may yield the greatest
Variety; so that every Number may be a little <HI>Pocket-Library,</HI>
describing Folio's, Quarto's, Oc∣tavo's, Pamphlets and Manuscripts: By
which different Sizes, Readers, of different Circumstances, may be the
easier suited in the Purchases they are inclin'd to. Then also, as
much, generally, as Opportunity will allow, of the various Sciences in every
Number, for the like Reason, that Read∣ers of different Studies may the
sooner be inform'd of what they are enquiring after. For a Publication
<HI>Topically</HI> di∣gested, or <HI>Chronologically,</HI> would be
impracticable, unless a Man had all the Books in the Kingdom together at
once, to methodize, before he set out: And then it would be very
inconvenient, by attracting only one Set of Readers to that one Branch, and
making all the rest wait till the Course of their respective Studies
arose; by which they would yet lose many pertinent Digressions upon
their own Subjects, which would occur in the different Sciences; for they
inter∣change, and some Subjects are often to be found in Books of all
Sciences, while other Books would be denied admission under any one of
them, because they do not distinctly pro∣fess any, or directly treat of
all. Moreover, the Sale of some Sciences would, in that case, be so
unproportionable to o∣thers, that it would be a great Discouragement to the
Under∣taking, and render the Edition of the whole, in many parts, incomplete.
Besides, this abstracted Revival of Books, in∣dependent of each other, as
to the Subjects, was never ob∣jected to any other Schemes of Abridgment, which
have been, or are carried on, in <HI>Latin, French,</HI> or <HI>English</HI>;
the Readers well knowing, how easily they may be directed to what they want,
by <HI>Tables</HI> and <HI>Indexes</HI> annexed to every Volume.</P>
<P>Thus we are not under any Anxiety about what Authors we shall
commence with, or with whom we shall conclude, since that which is look'd
for in this Number, may arise in <PB N="vii" REF="18"/> the next: Nor are we
under any Apprehension of being misconstrued to pledge our own Judgment
for the Merits of all the <HI>Authors</HI> we shall revive, since whatever
they are <HI>es∣sentially,</HI> 'tis the Application of them, the Use to
which they are converted, that makes them <HI>effectually</HI> good or bad;
wherefore, it is in the <HI>Readers</HI> Power to make few <HI>Authors</HI>
unworthy of such Revival. However, we shall use our best Endeavours to
please them, and always be submissive to better Judgments: So that if
any Improvement of our Undertaking shall come to hand, we shall gratefully
acknow∣ledge, and cheerfully pursue it; if not, and the Encourage∣ment of the
Publick shall be proportionable to the Industry we bestow upon this
Scheme, we hope that any Imperfec∣tions in our execution thereof, will bear no
proportion to the Benefits which may universally flow from it.</P>

<P>THIS being the most ancient <HI>British</HI> Historian
ex∣tant, demands the first Place in our <HI>British</HI> Library. Some
Particulars relating to the Author, with the different Editions and Character
of his Work, we refer to the bottom of the Page<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We
shall not here trouble our Reader with distinguishing two other Persons
of the same Name with our Author, since none of their genuine Works remain,
at least in History. 'Tis enough to observe that this GILDAS, called
<HI>Badonicus,</HI> because said to be born at <HI>Bath,</HI> for his
singular Prudence and the Se∣verity of his Morals, was surnamed the WISE;
that he was Monk of <HI>Bangor</HI>; flourish'd in the middle of the sixth
Century, and lived to about the end of the third part thereof, as may ap∣pear
by this Treatise <HI>De Excidio Britanniae,</HI> the only one of his writing
extant, as Arch-bp <HI>Usher</HI> assures it to be. He wrote it in
<HI>Latin,</HI> in a Stile according to that Age, harsh and per∣plexed
enough; and the first Edition of it, published by <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI>
in 8vo. <HI>London,</HI> 1525. and dedicated to <HI>Cuthbert Tonstal</HI> Bp.
of <HI>Durham,</HI> was from an incorrect Copy; re-printed at <HI>Basil</HI>
1541. and at <HI>London</HI> 1568. This last Edition, or another much about
the same time, which <HI>John Josseline</HI> gave of it from an∣other MS.
is but little more perfect than that first, which was remitted into the
<HI>Bibliotheca Patrum:</HI> But the latest and best is in Dr.
<HI>Gale</HI>'s Collection of ancient <HI>English</HI> Historians, 3 vol.
Fol. <HI>Oxon.</HI> 1684. who had the advantage of a more ancient and bet∣ter
Copy, as Bp. <HI>Nicholson</HI> observes. The Life of <HI>Gildas</HI> is
writ∣ten at large by <HI>Caradoc</HI> of <HI>Lancarvan,</HI> and by an
Anonymous Author, publish'd by <HI>John a Bosco</HI> in <HI>Biblioth.
Florent.</HI> also more briefly in <HI>Bale, Pits,</HI> and <HI>Fuller</HI>'s
Worthies; which last wonders, not without Reason, that <HI>Gerard
Vossius</HI> should attribute a Comedy in <HI>Plautus</HI> to this our
<HI>Gildas,</HI> upon such slender Grounds as he there mentions. As to his
Character, <HI>Milton</HI> tells us, That <HI>Gildas</HI> is every way
preferable, in speaking of the <HI>British</HI> Wars, to the <HI>Saxon</HI>
Writers, and a good Reason he gives for it: because <HI>Gildas</HI> was
nothing conceited of the <HI>British</HI> Valour, whereas the <HI>Saxons</HI>
ever magnified their own Deeds. Vide <HI>Mils. Hist. of Brit.</HI> Lib.
3.</NOTE>. But the Subject Matter of this <PB N="2" REF="25"/> <HI>Epistle to
the Britains,</HI> and his Method of handling it, may be best gathered from
the Arguments he briefly touches upon, under distinct Heads in the following
Order.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of the Island, its Situation and Extent; the number of
its Cities, the Magnificence of its Buildings, and Fertility of its Soil. 2.
The Disobedience of the People, both in Religion and Government; their
monstrous Idols before the Introduction of Christianity, and their
Character by <HI>Porphiry,</HI> for their detestable Tyrants. Then he
proposes to recount their Sufferings under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, not
from the <HI>British</HI> Authors, they being destroyed by their Foes, or
transported by their Exiles; but from foreign Accounts. So passes to, 3.
The Subjection of the Island, and how tamely she received the foreign Yoke.
4. Of her Rebellion under Queen <HI>Boadicia</HI>; her neglect to secure her
Conquests by Sea and Land; and final Overthrow; which intro∣duced, 5. Her
second Subjection and dreadful Slavery, till, 6. Her second Relief by
<HI>Christianity</HI>; which produced 7. Her Persecution under
<HI>Dioclesian</HI>; and, 8. Many holy Martyrs; as, <HI>Alban</HI> of
<HI>Verolam,</HI> with <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Julius</HI> of <HI>Carlile,</HI>
besides many others not here named: also of their triumphant State till, 9.
The <HI>Arian</HI> Heresy; and 10. The Usurpation and Tyranny of
<HI>Maximus,</HI> followed by, 11. The Invasion of the <HI>Scots</HI> and
<HI>Picts.</HI> 12. Their Ex∣pulsion by the <HI>Romans</HI>; 13. The
Re-invasion by those Neighbours; 14. And second Deliverance by the
<HI>Romans,</HI> who having taught the <HI>Britains</HI> to arm themselves,
and fortify their Country, take their last Farewell. 15. Of the third 
<PB N="3" REF="26"/> wastful Spoil by the aforesaid Enemy. 16. And by a
de∣vouring Famine. 17. Of their pitiful but fruitless Address to the
<HI>Roman</HI> Consul <HI>Agitius.</HI> 18. Of the brave Resistance to
which some of them were driven by Necessity; and the Victory they
obtained against their Enemies, by whom they were forsaken, tho' not by
their Iniquities. Therefore, 19. Of their Vices, and the Licentiousness
which followed their Peace and Plenty: Their Choice of wicked Princes, and the
Corruption of their Pastors. 20. The sudden A∣larm of their inveterate
Enemies. 21. And new Calamities by Pestilence. 22. Of their Councils to
redress themselves. 23. And Invitation of their far most cruel Enemy the
<HI>Sax∣ons</HI> to aid them against the Northern Powers. 24. Who totally
waste and spoil the Country. 25. The miserable State of the fugitive
<HI>Britains</HI>; their gathering head under <HI>Aurelius Ambrosius</HI>;
Battle with and Victory over the <HI>Sax∣ons.</HI> 26. Of the last Victory
obtained by the <HI>Britains</HI> against them at the Siege of the Mountain
of <HI>Bath</HI> (or <HI>Badon-Hill</HI>) forty four Years and one Month after
the landing of the <HI>Sax∣ons,</HI> and also <HI>the Time of my
Nativity,</HI> says <HI>Gildas.</HI> In this Article, the most observable
of all the rest, as being now enter'd into the times of his own Knowledge,
our Author first bewails, and sharply reproves the Depravity of the
<HI>British</HI> Rulers in general; next, gives particular Characters of five
of them; beginning with the Tyrant <HI>Constantine</HI> then living, his
Perfidiousness, the Murders he committed under the Habit of the Saintly
<HI>Amphabale,</HI> his Adulteries and other Impieties. Then proceeds to
<HI>Aurelius Conanus,</HI> whom he reproaches in like manner: With equal
Severity he scourges <HI>Vortiper,</HI> a wicked Son of a good King. Nor does
he less chastise <HI>Cuneglasse,</HI> that <HI>golden Butcher,</HI>
as his Name inports; and concludes with the like Execrations a∣gainst that
<HI>Dragon</HI> of the <HI>Island, Maglocune,</HI> who surpassed many
Tyrants, as in Power, so in Mischief. Here he sub∣joins the Menaces
denounced against these and such like wicked Princes, by the sacred
Oracles of Holy Scripture. After which follows a Transition from the
<HI>Civil</HI> to the <HI>Ec∣clesiastical</HI> Corruptions; and here he
inveighs against the Vices of the Clergy no less freely than he had done
against those in the State; which, with several Examples from the New
Testament and some Fathers of the Church, concludes this his <HI>Epistle
to the Britains.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Translation</HI> of the said <HI>Epistle,</HI>
appears to have been made near the first Entrance of the <HI>Scottish</HI>
Line upon the <PB N="4" REF="27"/> Throne of <HI>England</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' this Translation of <HI>Gildas</HI> was made at the
Beginning of K. <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, we meet with no earlier Edition of it
in Print than that publish'd 8vo. 1638, and it was not improbably
re-published now again in 1652, on account of the sharp and Christian
Reproofs therein of Kings and Priests. The Editor says, That in rendering
this into <HI>English,</HI> much Faith has been observed; by which you may
discover the Author still the same, though in his Apparel fashioned to
the Time; in perusing of whom, the Reader shall find that, <HI>Impiety is
the great Destroyer of Empires, and that Kingdom which remains most
immaculate from Sin, stands safest from Ruin.</HI></NOTE>, as the Editor
tells us, and while the Translator was under some Confinement, as he
informs us himself in his large <HI>Introduction to the Inhabitants of the
Island;</HI> which further contains, chiefly some Apologies for
<HI>Gildas,</HI> as to his using so much Scripture Application, and that,
not according to the vulgar Version, as <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> has
observ'd; with an Answer also to this Author's erro∣neous Observation
upon the <HI>Dioclesian</HI> Persecution from <HI>Gildas</HI> himself.
Then he strives more favourably to inter∣pret the Invectives wherewith
<HI>Gildas</HI> has been accused to have aspersed the <HI>Britains</HI>
by Sir <HI>John Price</HI>; as that our Author having already recorded their
praise-worthy Deeds in his <HI>Chronicle,</HI> cited by <HI>Henry</HI> of
<HI>Huntington,</HI> intended now to admonish them of their reproveable
Actions only in this <HI>Epistle,</HI> according to what <HI>Gildas</HI>
says in his own <HI>Prologue</HI> to it: 
<Q REND="inline">"That he does not now determine so much to
re∣port the Dangers of the bloody Battles of most valiant Sol∣diers, as the
Perils of slothful Men."</Q> In like manner, the Translator excuses the
Character of so much Barbarity given to the <HI>Scotch, Picts,</HI> and
<HI>Irish</HI> by our Author, as also his hard Censures of the
<HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>English</HI>; so descends from the ancient
<HI>Union</HI> of these Nations, to that which was then on foot between the
<HI>English</HI> (including the <HI>British</HI>) and the <HI>Scotch</HI>;
and because of K. <HI>James</HI>'s Descent from the Blood Royal of these
three Nations, concludes with a Motion to <HI>unite</HI> also the Titles of
his Dominions under the general Name of GREAT BRITAIN.</P>

Berthelet,</HI> near to the <HI>Cundite,</HI> at the Sign of <HI>Lucrece: cum
Privilegio:</HI> without Date or Name of the Author. 52 Pages 8vo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Altho' this Dialogue is undated, it may appear to have been
printed at the Beginning of our <HI>Reformation</HI>; and tho' the Au∣thor's
Name was not yet publish'd to it, it is well known to have been written by
that famous Clerk and Schoolman WILLIAM of OCCHAM, so called from being born
in a Village of that Name in <HI>Surrey,</HI> as <HI>Camden</HI> and others
have observ'd. It was written by our Author so early as the Year 1305, if
the MS. Note on the Copy before me is right. There was another E∣dition of it
afterwards in 1540, wherein it is said to be written by <HI>William</HI> of
<HI>Occham,</HI> the great Philosopher, in <HI>English</HI> and
<HI>Latin.</HI> [<HI>Extat. Lat. in Goldast. Monarch. T. Ed.</HI>] The Author
was Scholar to <HI>John Duns Scotus,</HI> and afterwards, his Antagonist. In
their grand Scholastic Controversy, <HI>Scotus</HI> was distinguished
Father of the <HI>Reals,</HI> and <HI>Occham</HI> of the <HI>Nominals.
Occham,</HI> flushed with his Success, undertook Pope <HI>John</HI> the
23d, and gave a mortal Wound to his <HI>Temporal Power over Princes.</HI> He
got a good Guardian, <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> the Emperor, whose
Court was his Sanctuary, but he was excommunicated by the Pope; and the
Masters of <HI>Paris</HI> condemned him for an Heretic, and burnt his Books;
which <HI>Fuller</HI> conceives to be the Cause why <HI>Luther</HI> was so
vers'd in his Works, which he had at his Fingers ends; being the sole
Schoolman in his Library whom he esteem'd. The Pope being afterwards, it
seems, reconciled to him, he was restored to his State with the Repute of
an <HI>Acute Schoolman. Fox,</HI> in his <HI>Book of Martyrs,</HI> Ed. 1576.
fol. 376. says, that in the Time of K. <HI>Edward</HI> II. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Gulielmus Occham</HI> was a worthy
Divine, and of a right sincere Judgment, as the Times wou'd then either give
or suffer."</Q> The same Historian further, fol. 393. mentions this
<HI>Dialogue,</HI> as of <HI>Occham</HI>'s Writing, tho' it appeared without
the Name of its Author. He there also men∣tions another of his Books, called
his <HI>Questions and Distinctions</HI>; and quotes <HI>John Sleidan</HI>'s
History in his Commendation; who, telling us the said <HI>Occham</HI>
flourished in the Year 1326. gives us an Abstract of another of his Books,
on <HI>the Authority of the Bishop of Rome.</HI> These two last, with two
more of his writing, were printed abroad, between the Years 1491 and 1496, as
appears in <HI>Corn. à Beughem</HI>'s <HI>Incunab. Typographiae,</HI>
12mo. Amst. 1688. p. 100. As for the Author's Death, some place it in 1330,
others seventeen Years later. See <HI>Leland, Bale, Pits, Fuller,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Cave, Du Pin,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THis notable little Tract was written to silence the Clergy, and
answer their unreasonable Expectations, that the Pope might exercise a
Jurisdiction over the Temporalities of <PB N="6" REF="29"/> Princes, and the
Church be exempted from contributing of its Riches in time of need, either for
the Relief of the Poor or the Security of the Nation where they abide; as may
ap∣pear by the following Abstract thereof.</P>
<P>CLERICUS begins with complaining how much the Ec∣clesiastical
Rights are invaded, and what wrongs the Clergy endure against all Law. MILES
asks him, what Law is? And he answers; the Ordinances of the Popes, and
Decrees of the Fathers. MILES allows that what they have hereto∣fore ordain'd
in Matters of Temporality, may be Law to the Clergy, but not to the Laity; none
having power to ordain Statutes of Things, over which they have no Lord∣ship;
therefore, that he, lately, laugh'd heartily, when he heard that Pope
<HI>Boniface</HI> VIII. had made a new Statute, that he himself should be
above all secular Princes and King∣doms; and that he needed but to put it
into Writing, and all things were his: If he would have my Castle, my Town,
my Field, my Money, or the like, he need but to will, to write, and decree it,
and he's entitled to those Things. Then CLERICUS would derive this Authority
from <HI>Christ</HI> himself: To whom it is said in the <HI>Psalms, Ask
of me and I will give Nations to thine Heritage, and all the World about to thy
Possession:</HI> And of whom it is written, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. <HI>That
he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> Then he argues from the
<HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Holy Church,</HI> that <HI>Peter</HI> was ordain'd
<HI>Christ</HI>'s full Vicar for himself and Successors, so has the
same Power over Temporalities as <HI>Christ</HI> had. But here MILES
distinguishes two States of <HI>Christ</HI>; one of his Humility, the
other of his Power and Majesty: The former, from the Time that he took
Flesh and Blood to his Passion; the latter, after his Re∣surrection;
when he said, <HI>All Power is given to me in Hea∣ven and Earth:</HI> That
<HI>Peter</HI> was ordain'd <HI>Christ</HI>'s Vicar for the State of his
Humility, and to follow him in those Things which he did in that State, or to
exercise that Power which <PB N="7" REF="30"/> he, as mortal Man, did; and not
that which after his Glo∣rification he receiv'd. Here it is proved from
Scripture that <HI>Christ</HI> neither had, nor pretended to a temporal
Kingdom; and that <HI>Peter</HI> had not by his Commission the Keys of the
Kingdom of Earth given him, but of Heaven; that he was <HI>Christ</HI>'s
Vicar in the Godly Kingdom of Souls, and not in <HI>Temporal Lordship</HI> of
Castles and Lands: And this again is proved out of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Then
CLERICUS flies to another Argument; for seeing it allow'd that Holy Church
may correct Sins, he infers, that he who has to do in the know∣ledge of Sin,
must know and deem in Right and Wrong; and since there is Right and Wrong
in Temporal Matters, the Pope ought consequently to rule and deem in Temporal
Causes. But MILES having shew'd the Absurdity of this Sophism, and that
Right and Wrong in Temporal Matters, are to be judg'd by Temporal Laws, proves
this also out of Scripture; where even in case of the People's
Disobedience to those Laws, it appears the Clergy are only to admonish
and warn them that they be <HI>subject to Princes,</HI> and in an∣other Place
that <HI>every Soul</HI> shall be <HI>subject</HI> to the <HI>higher
Powers;</HI> which excepts not the Clergy themselves. 
<Q REND="inline">"And if you will needs be knowing in such
Causes, says he, be∣cause Wrong and Sin are link'd together; it belongs
to you to know and deem in Causes of Wedlock; I pray will you therefore say
it follows, that you shall know and deem of all that belongeth thereto, for
the <HI>knitting of the Deed?</HI>"</Q> So advises him not to intermeddle in
the Judg∣ment of Things which concern Temporality; 
<Q REND="inline">"For so much as ye usurp and take upon you
that which belongs to others, it is right mete that ye suffer as ye do."</Q>
Then CLERICUS asks if he can deny that the Temporal Power should be
serviceable to the Spiritual? MILES allows the Temporality should be so
far serviceable to them, as to find those who worship and serve God all
that is necessary for them; that in the old Law they were handsomely
provided for, but not thereby ordain'd any Temporal Kingdom or Lordship; for
what kind of Lordship was appointed the Mi∣nistry, may appear from four or
five Places of Scripture here quoted: from whence it is demanded, 
<Q REND="inline">"Lo to whom doth <HI>Christ</HI> and his
Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> liken you? To Work∣men, to hired Men, and Oxen; and not
to Kings. I pray you, be Workmen, and hired Men, Lords of Things? Then it
seemeth that <HI>Temporalities</HI> are granted you to help your Living, and
for Charge of Spiritual Admini∣stration, <PB N="8" REF="31"/> and not for
<HI>Lordship:</HI> And of the <HI>Spiritual,</HI> it is written in the Law of
<HI>Moses</HI>; there ye be likened to an Ox that threshes; for which it is
enough to take his Meat, though he fill all the Barn with his Travail."</Q> A
little far∣ther CLERICUS is for allowing Princes to enjoy their Tem∣poralities,

<Q REND="inline">"And let them suffer us, says he, in Peace
with ours."</Q> But MILES cannot allow this to be any ways rea∣sonable. For,
says he, we are to see the Wills of our Fore∣fathers fulfill'd, who gave
you these Temporalities so plen∣tifully, that you should dispose both
of them and yourselves to charitable Purposes, to the Health of our Souls
and the Honour of God, to praying for the Dead and relieving the Wants of the
Living; 
<Q REND="inline">"But ye do nothing so; ye spend away your
Temporality in sinful Deeds and Vanity; ye recke not for Honesty, no nor
for your own Law, nor for Dedes of Mercy and Charity, but in folly, and
<HI>bo∣bance,</HI> and in liking of this World, ye dispend all that was given
you for an holy Intent. Shall not his Wages be stopped who will not do Deeds
of <HI>Knighthood?</HI> He that holdeth of another, and doth not his due Office
and Ser∣vice, he shall lose and forgo his <HI>Fee.</HI>"</Q> Here he brings
in the Example of K. <HI>Joas,</HI> who would not let <HI>Joidas</HI> re∣ceive
any more of the Ecclesiastical Revenue, but apply it to the Reparation of
God's House; and concludes this Ar∣gument with observing, 
<Q REND="inline">"That ye have received all such Lordships and
Riches as the Wages of holy Chivalry, and to the Intent to have Cloth and Food;
with which two, the Apostle saith, he held him paid; and all the
o∣ver-plus, besides Cloth and Food, ye ought to spend in Deeds of Mercy and
Piety, as on poor People, that have need, and on such as be sick and
diseased, and oppressed with Misery: And if ye do not so, then
must <HI>we have to do therewith</HI>; for then it falleth to us to take heed
of your Temporality, that ye beguile not and deceive the Quick and the
Dead."</Q> CLERICUS observes, that King <HI>Joas</HI> did not apply the Money
to his own Use, but to that of Holy Church. 
<Q REND="inline">"But now-a-days ye take our Goods, which ye
spend not to the Use of Holy Church, but on your busy and unruly
Soldiers, and on Ships and Engines of War."</Q> MILES answers, 
<Q REND="inline">"That neither does the King apply it to his own
Use, but for your Safeguard, the De∣fence of Holy Church, and of your Goods
and Chattels. That if the King's Power should fail, the Gentry, such as are
needy and had prodigally consumed their Substance, <PB N="9" REF="32"/>
would turn to yours, and destroy all you have; therefore that the King's
Strength is to you as a strong Wall, and his Peace is your Peace: That by
giving a little Portion to him, you buy your own Safeguard: But as ye have
al∣ways been unkind for the Goodness he hath done, so now ye complain
against what is your own Profit: That if Kings at their own Costs and Peril
are to defend you, and you to rest, in Idleness and Luxury, eating,
drinking, and solacing yourselves, then you only are Kings, and they your
Slaves."</Q> Then he proves from Scripture again, that the Church, or Riches of
it, should not be spared when Christian People are in Danger; 
<Q REND="inline">"The Ghostly Temple, which is Mankind, being of
more worth than the Tem∣ple that is made of Lime and Stone."</Q> CLERICUS
ob∣jects that if those things which are once given to God may be taken away
again, then all Vows may be made void. But MILES distinguishes, that what
he has said is not to with∣draw such Gifts, but to apply them to those
Uses for which they were first given. Then CLERICUS would allude from the
Words of our Saviour, how free the Clergy were from paying Tribute to Princes.
But MILES argues, that the Example he produces, and the answer therein given,
was for Christ, and not for you; however grants, that Clerks in their own
Persons should be free, but not such as lead their Lives as lewd Men.
Yet, tho' some may be thus freed in their Person by the Privilege of
Princes, shall your Fields have now the same Freedom? And he who had before
a yearly Tribute from them, lose it afterwards in you? The Commonwealth
must be defended at the Cost of the Com∣monalty; and whatever Part thereof
enjoys this Defence, 'tis most agreeing with right, that he set his
Shoulder and help to bear the Burden: Then if Possessions are as
rightly subject to the common Charge as to the yearly Rent, he shall be
under Charge whoever owns them. If ye talk of Prescription; we answer, in
as much longer as this Free∣dom, or Exemption has been allow'd by the Benignity
of Princes, so much the sooner ye should be ready to pay your Part where
need requires it; but both holy Writ and civil Powers abolish this
Prescription, as appears by Examples here cited. CLERICUS thinks it hard that
Kings should resume the Privileges granted by their Predecessors. But
MILES urges that any particular Privilege, however long or firmly granted,
must submit to general Occasions; and, if it be found hurtful to the
Commonwealth, may be repeal'd <PB N="10" REF="33"/> in time of need, as
<HI>Solomon,</HI> in some Matters of Theft, changed somewhat even of God's
Law CLERICUS would insinuate, that it was Emperors who establish'd
these Things, and that they might guide the Reins of the Law, but not Kings.
MILES looks upon this as a kind of Blasphemy, proceeding either from
Ignorance or Envy; so draws an Instance from <HI>France</HI> and the
Empire, shewing how di∣stinctly and independently the one exercises its
Power from the other. That as the Emperor may make Laws over all his Empire,
and add or diminish as he thinks good; so may the King of <HI>France</HI>
either utterly repel the Emperor's Laws, or change, or clearly banish them,
and at his Pleasure or∣dain new ones. This he concludes with several
Examples from Scripture, proving the Subjection of the Clergy to their Princes;
as how by anointing, they acknowledg'd them to be their Princes and Rulers, how
they guarded, attended on, and pray'd for them as such, insomuch that
CLERICUS cannot forbear breaking off the Conference, with observing that it
was drawing towards Night, but he'd answer it all in the Morning.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner ends this ancient and remarkable Treatise,
thus publish'd in <HI>English,</HI> with express Priviledge, by K.
<HI>Henry</HI>'s Printer, no doubt to forward and strengthen the
<HI>Reformation</HI> then in its Infancy. But if the Reader would see this
Argument, on the King's <HI>Ecclesiastical Supremacy,</HI> as it more
particularly regards the <HI>English</HI> Nation, deduced from a vast
Variety of our most authentic Instruments and Records, we must refer him
to Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI>'s voluminous Collections on that Head, in three Volumes
Folio, of which we shall here next take a short Survey, because of the
Af∣finity of the Subject, and its being traced from the earliest times;
however the Author is thereby ranged in this Num∣ber before some others who
were earlier Writers.</P>

<P>Then follows a Copious Dedication to the King, wherein the Author
acknowledges, that his Obligations to his Ma∣jesty, his Father and

his Majesty's conferring on him without his Sollicitation, the Office of

<HI>Saxons.</HI> 5. The Conversion of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings to
Christianity by <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk, by whom the Pope began his
Encroachments upon our <HI>British</HI> Bishops, Kings, and Churches, with
their Resistance thereof; also the Claim and Practice of the said
Eccle∣siastical Jurisdiction by our <HI>Saxon</HI> Christian Kings,
till sup∣planted by the <HI>Danes.</HI> 6. The like claimed and exercised
by the <HI>Danes</HI>; likewise by <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and
<HI>Ha∣rold,</HI> with their Opposition of Papal Impositions. 7. The said
Sovereign Eccesiastical Authority claimed and executed by our first
<HI>Norman</HI> Kings, till the end of King <HI>Richard</HI> I. wherewith the
Author concludes this Tome, including many Oppositions made against the

Becket;</HI> with the Practices of other Popish Prelates against their
Kings. 8. Also the In∣stitution of Arch-Bishopricks and Bishopricks in
<HI>England, Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI>; the Subordination of those
in <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> to those of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and
<HI>York,</HI> with the Con∣tests of these two Primacies against each
other. 9. Instances of the Popes, Cardinals, Arch-Bishops, Bishops,
Priests, Monks, Nuns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> their Pride, Covetousness,
Ambition, World∣liness, Simony, Perjury, Treachery, Hatred, Malice, Bri∣bery,
Injustice, Corruptions, Incontinency, Abuses of Ex∣communications, and
other Ecclesiastical Censures; their great Neglect of all religious
Duties, Contempts of their own Canons, Bulls, Decretals, during these Kings
Reigns, with the Endeavours used to redress them. 10. The At∣tempts of
Popes and Prelates to introduce their Canon Laws and Decretal, to advance their
Authority, and trample down our Municipal Laws, Kings Prerogatives, and
People's Liberties, with the Banishment thereof out of the Realm. 11. A
Vindication of the Right of our Kings to the Sove∣reign Feodal Dominion of
<HI>England, Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Refutation of the forged
Claims thereto by the Popes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 12. The Bulls, Letters, of
several Popes and Legates, to our own and other Princes, to advance their
Authority, oppress, fleece, and invade their Realms, under pretence of
relieving the Holy Land against the <HI>Saracins</HI>; to tax, censure,
command, or absolve at Pleasure, and wreek <PB N="13" REF="36"/> their
Malice on those who comply'd not with their Impo∣sitions. 13. Their
canonizing <HI>Anselm, Becket,</HI> and other Prelates, as Saints, Martyrs,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and adoring them more than God or Christ himself, for
their Treasons against their Princes, to advance the Miter above the Crown,
and en∣courage the like Rebellions by the Examples of these sainted
Traitors, and the Pilgrimages to their Shrines. 14. The intolerable Pride,
Insolence, Oppressions, Rapines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of our Popish
Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and Clergymen, when promoted to the highest
Secular Offices, and trusted with the Temporal and Spiritual Sword, which
made them double Tyrants; with the Canons of the Popes and Censures of
Popish Writers against such their worldly Employments in former Ages. 15.
The true original Ground of erecting most Monasteries by our Kings and
others, to expiate their Adulteries, Rapes, Murders, or Impieties, merit
Salvation, save or redeem their Souls from Purgatory. With the
Un∣cleanness, Whoredoms, Adulteries of Popish Prelates, Priests, Monks,
Nuns, thro' the Prohibition of Marriages; and of the ancient Suppression of
Monasteries (for such Impurities) by our Kings. 16. The Grievances and
Complaints of fo∣reign Princes against Popes and their Legates
Usurpa∣tions, Extortions, unjust Sentences, Excommunications, Interdicts,
Deprivations relating to our Kings, or registred in our Histories. 17.
Transcripts of many Laws and Char∣ters of Christian Princes, evidencing
their Sovereign Pre∣rogative over all Ecclesiastical Affairs and Persons,
as ex∣emplified in the <HI>Chartae Antiquae,</HI> and other <HI>Rolls</HI> in
the Tower of <HI>London</HI>; all other their Records and Writs before King
<HI>John</HI> relating to their Ecclesiastical or Civil Govern∣ment being
long since perished, except some Copies of them in some old
Leiger-Books, belonging to Monasteries or Hi∣storians already printed.
Wherefore, this first Tome con∣sists chiefly of Historical and other
Collections, and some Charters of our Kings not formerly printed: whereas,
all succeeding it (especially 3, 4, 5,) will be almost wholly made up of
useful, pertinent, and rare <HI>Records,</HI> not hitherto published,
unknown to most Antiquaries and Lawyers; 
<Q REND="inline">"which, thro' God's Assistance, by your kind
Acceptation, says our Author, of the Tomes now published, I shall be
encouraged to communicate to the World with all possible Expedition, for
the Honour of our King, Kingdoms, Church and Religion."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="37"/>At the End of this Volume is an
Advertisement to the Reader, intimating that the late dreadful Fire (of
<HI>London</HI>) having in three Days space turned 88 Parishes and their
Churches, with the Cathedral-Church of this glorious City, to Ashes; and
among other Losses and Mischiefs to the several Companies of the City,
most of all endamaged the Company of Printers and Stationers, most of
whose Habi∣tations, Storehouses, Shops, Stocks and Books were not only
consumed, but their Ashes and scorch'd Leaves con∣veyed aloft and
dispersed by the Wind to Places above 16 Miles distant, to the Admiration
of Beholders; and that a∣mong Millions of other Books thus suddenly
destroy'd, while our Author was busy in securing the publick
<HI>Records</HI> of the Kingdom, his Printer's House with most of the
printed Copies of this Tome, then finish'd at the Press (all except the
Tables to it) as likewise the second Tome formerly pub∣lished, and of the
first Book, and third Tome (wherein he had made some Progress) were there
burnt together with it; not above 70 of them being rescued from the Fire, to
the Author's Damage near 2000 <HI>l.</HI> wherefore he did not print his
intended <HI>Tables</HI> for so few Copies of this Tome, till God should
enable him to re-print it, especially since the Pages of the re-printed
Volume (by reason of some Additions) will vary from these already
printed, so make the Tables unsuitable thereto.</P>

<P>THis second Volume, which was first printed, is dedicated to

En∣courager of this Work.</P>
<P>The Author has prefix'd to this Tome a brief necessary
<HI>Introduction</HI> of 80 Pages, to supply the want of his <HI>larger
In∣troduction</HI> <PB N="15" REF="38"/> comprised in the first Book of the

at first design'd.</P>
<P>This Tome, as those intended to succeed it, principally
consists of memorable Records (in the Tower of <HI>London</HI>) not
formerly published, intermixed with Historical Passages out of our
most ancient Historians of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion writing in or
nearest these Times. They are printed in their proper Dialects, the better
to be communicated to fo∣reign Countries, and prevent all Cavils against
their Transla∣tions. All the said Records are carefully compar'd by the
Author himself with the Originals, which may serve to cor∣rect, ratify and
illustrate many obscure Passages in our Hi∣storians, Chronologers,
and King <HI>John</HI>'s printed Charter, and supply many observable
Defects of Bulls, Patents, Writs, Records, Transactions, relating to the
Ecclesiastical Supre∣macy of our Kings.</P>
<P>In his <HI>Preface</HI> to his Readers, he speaks of others who
had cursorily handled the Subject, as, Sir <HI>Ed. Coke,</HI> Sir <HI>John

<HI>Roger Twisden</HI>; but never before chronologically and histo∣rically

Chronologers, or Divines. Then he gives his Reasons for praeponing this
second Volume, in point of Publication before the first. The Uses and
Benefits of it to our Kings and their Officers of State, Prelates, Divines,
Judges, Lawyers, Nobility and Gentry in both Kingdoms, and all Professors
of the Protestant Faith, or <HI>Romish</HI> Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>The brief necessary Introduction sets forth, what Sovereign
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction is; the Claims of Popes and Bi∣shops of
<HI>Rome</HI>; their fictitious Titles; their Practices and Doctrines; the
pretended Monarchy of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and the imaginary Succession of
the Popes, with their Claims, and the Grounds refuted from their own Practices,
and Asser∣tions of their own Writers.</P>

be inserted in their proper Places of this <HI>Historical Vindication</HI>;
which are here ranged in an Historical Order, and each referr'd to its proper
Place in the said last Reign, according as their Dates, or other
Cir∣cumstances directed him, together with the Pages and Lines where they
most properly may be inserted in the next E∣dition. With this Supplement
the whole Work finishes at Page 1307. Then comes an Advertisement to the
Readers, informing us of fourteen several Tables he had made to this third
Tome, in an Alphabetical and Chronological Method, after the Manner of the
preceeding Volume: And we are referr'd to such Tables in this last Volume
also, at the End of its Table of Contents. But such Tables or Indexes were
omitted, at least in a very fair Set of these scarce and elabo∣rate
Books, whence this short View of them is extracted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This last Volume of Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI>'s said
<HI>Records</HI> was design'd, by him, to have borne the same Title with
the two former, as may appear in the Book itself; but the Author dying just
before it was publish'd, those who were concern'd in the Edition call'd it
<HI>The History of King John,</HI> &amp;c. in hopes that appearing (under
that more general Title,) in the Shape and Disguise of an entire Work, it
would go off the more readily, as Bishop <HI>Nicholson</HI> has
suggested; but with what Propriety, or Regard to the Subject, is left for
others to consider. 'Tis certain that neither of the three Volumes have been
so sufficiently used by, or even known to suc∣ceeding Writers of, or
upon our <HI>English</HI> History, as such copious Materials, so
carefully collected, do deserve. One Reason, no doubt, is, the Scarcity of
the two former Volumes; which are advanced to such an extraordinary Price,
that it is well known, the <HI>Complete Set</HI> has been sold for <HI>Thirty
Pounds.</HI> Another reason for their having lain so much in Obscurity,
might be, some pub∣lick Punishment the Author once underwent, for writing
an∣other <PB N="21" REF="44"/> Book, but in the former Reign, and long before he
was <HI>Keeper</HI> of the <HI>Records</HI>; for which he yet had a handsome
Re∣compence assign'd him by the Parliament, however it might leave some
Distaste to his Name upon the Minds of many; as we may elsewhere
observe. The last cause of their Neglect may be, that artful Disregard
which has been insinuated of these <HI>Col∣lections,</HI> to abate the
Curiosity of the Laity, and dissuade their looking into them. The Right
Reverend Author last quoted, speaking of those two Tomes which perish'd
in the Fire of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> adds, 
<Q REND="inline">"And no Man has hitherto thought it worth his
Ex∣pence and While to give us a new Edition from any of the few that escaped:
His Third has enough, in all Conscience, to satisfy any reasonable
Reader, and <HI>supersede</HI> his <HI>Enquiry</HI> into the State of the
Case, in either former, or following Ages."

in two fair Copies of this very scarce old Book, which I have seen; and the
said Title is at the Head of the Kalendar or Table of Contents, which is
printed in double Columns, as most of the Book also is. But it seems to
want the first Leaf, which might contain a more gene∣ral Title, and
possibly the Name also of its Author. For the first Signature in both
those Copies is A 2, the Book not being numerically paged at top, nor has it
any Printer's Name, or Date when printed. The late Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> in his
Copy has en∣titled it, <HI>The Customes of London, or</HI> ARNOLDE<HI>'s

the whole first Chapter; at the End whereof (which gives it the Name of a

rather, one Year being mis-printed twice over, the 13th of <HI>Henry</HI> the

<P>THis scarce and learned old Treatise, so remarkable both in
Beauty of the Print and Ornaments, and Rarity of the Subject, for a Book of
such Antiquity, has a Frontis∣piece from a neat wooden Cut, wherein those
Sciences, leading to the Studies here treated of, are represented, with
some of the Ancients who were eminent therein: And at the Bottom of the
said Title are these six Lines; 
<Q>

<P>In his Dedication to <HI>Robert Duddeley,</HI> of the mooste

mooste excellente Majestye, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he tells his Lordship, that
Men may behold, in this <HI>Glass,</HI> the Heavens with her Planets and
Stars, the Earth with her beautiful Re∣gions, and the Seas with her merveilous
Increase; and that <PB N="27" REF="50"/> if his Lordship will take this Work
into his Tuition, he shall be boulden'd to present him with others of his
Labours, the particular Titles of seven whereof he here recites<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' this Dr. <HI>Cuningham</HI> of <HI>Norwich</HI> had been a
Traveller, yet being bred a Physician, it may be look'd upon as somewhat
extraordinary, that he should set forth a Book upon this Subject, so much
more copious and elegant than had hitherto been pub∣lish'd; and also write
so many others as he here mentions; the Names whereof are, <HI>An Apology; A
New Quadrat, by no Man ever publish'd; The Astronomical Ring;
Organographia; Gazo∣philacion Astronomicum; Chronographia</HI>; and
<HI>Commentaries in Hip∣pocrates de Aëre, Aquis &amp; Regionibus:</HI> The
Author being now no more than twenty-eight Years of Age.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After this Dedication, follow some <HI>Latin</HI> Verses by
Dr. <HI>Gilbert Barckley,</HI> and <HI>Tho. Langley</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI>
in Praise of the Author and his Work: At the Back of which is a wooden Print
of the Author in his Doctor's Habit.</P>
<P>Then follows his Preface, setting forth the Benefits of these
Cosmographical Studies. Herein he tells us, they are daily more and more
perceiv'd; for what Country or Island is not in our Age search'd out? So
exemplifies in <HI>Vespu∣tius Americus.</HI> And concludes the said Preface
with ob∣serving, that by this Glass, 
<Q REND="inline">"such as are delighted in tra∣vailing as well by
Land as Water, shall receive no small Comfort; and the other sort, by it
may also protract and set out particular <HI>Cards</HI> for any Countrye,
Region or Pro∣vince, or else the universal Face of the Earth in a
<HI>gene∣rale Map.</HI> And that the Precepts might seme facile and plaine, I
have (says he) reduced it into the Forme of a <HI>Dialoge</HI>; the Names of
the Personages indede fained, but yet most aptly serving our
Institution. In which SPON∣DAEUS (representing the Scholar) maketh Doubtes,
asketh Questions, objecteth; yea and, sometyme, digresseth not from the
Imaginations of the grosse witted. Unto which, PHILONICUS (supplying the
Office of a Teacher) an∣swereth to all Objections and giveth Praecepts. What
Diligence I have given in time of the Printing, to the Correction hereof; and
also in devising sundry newe <HI>Ta∣bles, Pictures,
Demonstrations,</HI> and <HI>Praecepts</HI>; that you may easily judge by
readyng of the same Worke. Also what Charges the Printer hath
susteined, that his good Will might not be wanting, that shall be
evident, confer∣rying his beautiful <HI>Pictures</HI> and <HI>Letters</HI> with
such Workes as herto hath bene publish'd. And thus I leave the with 
<PB N="28" REF="51"/> my COSMOGRAPHICALL GLASS; requirying that these my
Travayles and Labours be not rewarded with Ingra∣titude or ill Reporte. And if
for the Difficultie of the Worke, any Errour escape; remember <HI>I am the
firste that ever in our Tongue have written of this Argument,</HI> and
therefore am constrained to find out the Pathe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> At
<HI>Norwich,</HI> the 18th of <HI>July,</HI> 1559.</P>
<P>The whole Work is divided into five Books, in the first whereof,
after some general Heads, leading to that Know∣ledge in Arithmetic and
Geometry, which is requisite for this Art, he defines Cosmography and
Geometry: Then gives you three Figures or Pictures; the first representing
<HI>Cosmography,</HI> by a Globe of the Heavens, containing the Earth; the
second, <HI>Geography,</HI> representing the Earth and Waters only; and the
last, <HI>Chorography,</HI> or the Representa∣tion of some one Town or
City, which he illustrates by an <HI>accurate Map</HI> of the excellent City
of NORWYCHE, as the Forme of it is, says he, at this present 1558; with
many Alphabetical References to an Explanation, at the bottom, of the principal
Places set forth in the same, (which Map has been look'd upon as a very
great Curiosity:) Hence he proceeds to define what the <HI>World</HI> is, and
to shew that it is made of <HI>two Parts.</HI> The Number also of the
<HI>Heavens</HI>; with the Errors of some Ancients. That only eight Hea∣vens
were found out by the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> that <HI>Ptolemy</HI> found out the
ninth, and <HI>Alphonsus</HI> the tenth: So gives us a Fi∣gure of the
<HI>Coelestial Sphere.</HI> Next he describes what a <HI>Cen∣tre</HI> is,
what the <HI>Axis,</HI> and what a <HI>Diameter</HI>; what the <HI>Poles</HI>
are, what an <HI>oblique Sphere,</HI> how a Sphere differs from a
<HI>Circle.</HI> The <HI>Number</HI> of Circles in a Sphere, what the
<HI>Ho∣rizon</HI> is, the Division of it, with Figures of the several
sorts; what the <HI>Meridian</HI> is, the <HI>Zenith, Antipodes,</HI> the
<HI>Equinoctial</HI>; with the Use of the <HI>Horizon, Meridian,</HI> and
<HI>Equinoctial Circles:</HI> What the <HI>Zodiac</HI> is, and the
<HI>Ecliptic,</HI> what a <HI>Sign</HI> is, what a <HI>Degree,</HI> and what a
<HI>Minute</HI>; with the <HI>Septentrio∣nal</HI> Signes, <HI>Meridional</HI>
Signes, and the Use of the <HI>Zodiac.</HI> A <HI>Table</HI> of many notable
fixed <HI>Stars,</HI> with their several Names, their true Longitude,
Latitude, and Declination, faithfully rectified unto the Year 1559, profitable
for finding out the Latitude of any Country or Place. Then we have the two
Declinations of every <HI>Planet</HI> distinguish'd, with the Diversity
of the Sun's Declination from <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s Time to ours, and the Manner
how to find out, by a Quadrant, the Sun's Declination. After which we have a
<HI>Table,</HI> in two <PB N="29" REF="52"/> Parts, of <HI>Declination</HI> of
the <HI>Ecliptic,</HI> in <HI>Degrees, Minutes,</HI> and <HI>Seconds,</HI> from
the Equinoctial; answering to the <HI>Sun</HI>'s greatest Declination, 23
Degrees, 28 Minutes; being the true Declination of the Sun in this (our
Author's) Age, which Table is more copiously useful than <HI>Orontius,</HI>
or Doctor <HI>Re∣cord</HI>'s Table, and yet not so prolix as <HI>Erasmus
Reignholt</HI>'s. Next we have the <HI>Poles</HI> of the <HI>Zodiac</HI>
explain'd, what the <HI>Summer Tropic,</HI> and what the <HI>Winter</HI> is.
Whence the four <HI>Seasons</HI> of the Year are derived, what the two
<HI>Colures</HI> are, the <HI>Artick</HI> Circle, and the <HI>Antartick</HI>
defin'd, from <HI>Proclus,</HI> as most of the other Distinctions are. Thus
PHILONICUS having learn'd his Scholar what the <HI>six</HI> greater Circles
of the Sphere are, and what the <HI>four</HI> lesser, gives him the
reason why they are so distinguish'd from <HI>John de
Sacro-Bosco.</HI> Then representing these several Parts together in one
Figure or Picture, he concludes his Account of the <HI>Celestial</HI> Sphere,
and so proceeds to that which comprehends the <HI>Elementary</HI> Region,
observing why it can consist but of four Elements; their Order and
Situation, the Division of the Air, where Comets, Hail and Snow are
engendred, what the Earth is, Diversity of Opinions touching its Form,
Objections against its Rotundity answer'd from <HI>Cleomedes,</HI> also
from the Ex∣ample of two Eclipses of the Moon, and Observation of some
Stars, with Reference for further Proof to <HI>Ptolemy, Philo, Aristotle,
Reignholt, Orontius, John de Sacro-Bosco,</HI> and Master <HI>Recorde</HI>;
who does almost repeat all their Argu∣ments, in his <HI>Castle of
Knowledge.</HI> Here, joining together all the Parts which have been
severally before treated of, in one Type or Figure of a compleat Sphere,
representing both the Heavens and the Earth, he concludes with making his
Scholar give him a Recapitulation of what he had learnt in this first Book;
so proceeds to</P>
<P>The second Book, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which is plainly
expressed the Order and Number of Zones, Parallels and Climates; also
sundry ways for the exact finding out of the Meridian Line, the Longitude and
Latitude of Places, with many other Pre∣cepts belonging to the making of a
Carte or Mappe. After an ingenious Introduction of this Book, and Repetition of
what is taught in it, the Author, seeing the Matter thereof chiefly de∣pends
upon Dimension and Mensuration, first shews what <HI>Di∣mension</HI>
is; what a Point, what a Line, what a Platform, and what a Body is. Then gives
us a Table of <HI>Measure</HI>; the quantity of <HI>Helvetian</HI> and of
<HI>English Miles</HI>; the different Signification of <HI>Longitude,</HI>
both in Astronomy and Cosmo∣graphy; <PB N="30" REF="53"/> what
<HI>Latitude</HI> is; how to find out the <HI>Circuit</HI> of the Earth and the
Vertical Point, with the Diversity of O∣pinions about the Circuit of the
Earth: Then, of what Parts are habitable, and what not. Of the Zones, and the
Error of <HI>Polybius</HI>; the Objection of some being uninhabitable
an∣swered; of the Inhabitants, who are distinguished by the Diversity
of their Shadows, as, the <HI>Amphiscii,</HI> or double-shadowed; the
<HI>Ascii,</HI> or People without Shadows; the <HI>He∣teroscii,</HI> or
those who have their Shadows on one Side, as we who have our Shadow directly
North, and the <HI>Antipodes,</HI> who have theirs to the South; lastly, the
<HI>Periscii,</HI> who have their Shadow going about the Horizon. Here
follows a <HI>Table of Shadows,</HI> shewing their Proportion to the
<HI>Gnomon</HI> (it being divided into 60 parts) for every Degree of the Sun's
Altitude; and also the quantity of the Shadow in every Country, Region and
City, thro' the universal Earth, when the Sun is in the Equinoxial and
Solsticial Points. Then returning to the <HI>Zones,</HI> he shews how they
differ from <HI>Cli∣mates,</HI> with <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s Division of Climates;
next, what <HI>Parallels</HI> are, exemplified in a Figure. The number of
Cli∣mates, also in a Figure; and Quantity both of them and Pa∣rallels; with a
<HI>Table containing the number of Parallels and Climates,</HI> with the
Elevation of the <HI>Pole-Artic,</HI> and <HI>Quantity</HI> of the longest
Day and Night answering hereto. Of South Parallels, and the Reason why
<HI>Avicenne</HI> thought the Air most temperate under the Equinoxial; which
introduces a Conjecture where <HI>Paradise</HI> was seated, and
<HI>Lyra</HI>'s Interpre∣tation that the <HI>Fiery Sword</HI> was the
<HI>burning Zone,</HI> with a Con∣jecture where <HI>Hell</HI> is seated.
After which, we have <HI>Gla∣rian</HI>'s Manner of finding out the Noon-Stead
or Meridian Line, and four other Methods also of finding the same. The
Order of finding the Height of any Planet or fix'd Star in the Noonstead Line
by Night. Then follows <HI>a Table of the Sun's Meridian Altitude above the
Horizon,</HI> calculated for every Degree in the Zodiac, respecting the
Elevation of the Pole-Artic, at <HI>Norwich</HI> 52 Degrees 10 Min. and the
Sun's Declination 23 Deg. 28 Min. The manner to find out the Elevation of the
Pole above the Horizon, and the <HI>Lati∣tude</HI> of any Region, City or Town,
several ways; especially by the <HI>Astronomy-Ring.</HI> Of finding the
<HI>Longitude</HI> of any Place, according to the Ancients, by
<HI>Eclipses</HI> of the Moon. That <HI>Atreus</HI> found out the time of
<HI>Eclipses.</HI> The Cause of the Moon's Eclipse. A Calculation of
such Eclipses of the Moon as shall happen from the Year 1560 till 1605;
apply∣ing <PB N="31" REF="54"/> the Time of their Beginning in Years, Days,
Hours and Minutes, unto the Meridian of <HI>Norwich</HI> exactly, which is 22
Degrees and 30 Minutes, from the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands: with the Figures of
all the said Eclipses. How to find the Longi∣tude of Regions by an
Eclipse. How to turn the Hours of the Day into Degrees and Minutes of the
Equinoxial, with a Table for that purpose. <HI>Apian</HI>'s Way of finding
out the <HI>Longitude</HI> of Places by the <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Staff,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Method to be taken when the Moon is West, or East of
the Star; further illustrated by an Example of finding the Longitude of
<HI>Norwich.</HI> Another Method of finding the Longitude of any Region in
every Place as well by Day as Night, and at every Hour, by means of a little
<HI>Clock,</HI> such as they used to wear in the fashion of a Tablet;
whereof were then made as excellent without <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> as any which
were brought from <HI>Flanders</HI>: with the Particulars of this Experiment
ends this second Book.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third Book</HI> is express'd the making and
Portraiture of the Face of the Earth, both in <HI>Cartes</HI> particular, and
also u∣niversal: with divers Things incident thereto. Here having shewn
what a chief Requisite the Art of Drawing or Delineat∣ing is in the Study of
Cosmography, and what noble Rewards the Ancients had in store for the
Inventors of Science; when they not only gave them abundance of Treasure, but
also deified them for the same: The Author descends to explain what an
<HI>Island</HI> is; what a <HI>Peninsula</HI>; an <HI>Isthmus</HI>; a
<HI>Conti∣nent</HI>; then exhibits them all in a Map together; with an Answer
to an Objection against the Form of the Terrestrial Globe; so begins with
teaching the Manner of making a particular Carte for any Region, and here draws
up a Ta∣ble of the <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Proportion</HI> of the
<HI>Equinoxial,</HI> or any great Circle, to every Parallel, North and South
therefrom. Hence we are led to a particular Example, containing the whole
Process in making a <HI>Map of England,</HI> and shewing how the Work
chiefly depends on the Meridian Line, ap∣pointing thereby the Longitudes; and
by Parallels of Cli∣mates, whose use in a Carte is to limit the Latitude
from the Equinoxial: This is illustrated by a Draught or Figure. From hence
we are taught how to describe three or four Regions in one Map, or as many as
are contained in one eighth Part of the Earth; and after the particular
Instruc∣tions for this Operation, we have the Form also thereof de∣lineated
to the Eye. So we proceed to the Composition of a Map for one half of the
Earth, whereof also we have a <PB N="32" REF="55"/> Draught. And this is
followed by the Method of making a Map for the whole Earth, which we are again
further ac∣quainted with by lineal Representations: And here we have a
<HI>Table</HI> of the <HI>Segments</HI> and Parts of the Equinoxial, drawn in a
plain Platform, answering to the Circumference of Parallels. A little further
is another <HI>Table of Regions</HI> and <HI>Cities</HI> subject to the
<HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>Planets.</HI> Then we have the Figure of an
<HI>Instrument,</HI> serving to make a Map, without knowing Longitude or
Latitude, which is here called a <HI>Geo∣graphical Plain Sphere,</HI> by which
not only the Distance of one Place from another may be found in the Map, but
of the Places themselves, in Miles also from one another; as by a
Demonstration here figured out appears: And with this Experiment ends the
third Book.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth Book</HI> lays down such necessary Principles
and Rules as are to be observed in <HI>Hydrography,</HI> and
<HI>Navigation.</HI> Herein it is proposed not to shew the minute
Difference of one Vessel from another, nor their Names, nor their Burden,
but how to correct the Errors in guiding and directing them. And first, we
have a Division of the Waters, from the gene∣ral Name of the Ocean, down to
Lakes and Ponds. The Cause of Spring and Ebb <HI>Tides.</HI> Cause of
<HI>Ebbing</HI> and <HI>Flow∣ing.</HI> How to find the <HI>Age</HI> of the
<HI>Moon</HI> at all times. The <HI>Epact,</HI> with a <HI>Table</HI> to find
it. A <HI>Table</HI> of the <HI>Sun's rising</HI> and <HI>going down</HI>
throughout the Year; whereby to find how long the Moon shines every Night. A
<HI>Table</HI> shewing how long the <HI>Moon shines</HI> in our
<HI>Horizon. Another</HI> shewing in what Places, chiefly on the
<HI>English</HI> Shore, the Moon makes full Seas. How to know the exact
<HI>Time</HI> of <HI>Ebbing</HI> and <HI>Flow∣ing,</HI> with a <HI>Table</HI>
for finding out <HI>Ebbs</HI> and <HI>Floods</HI> in the Coasts of
<HI>England, Scotland, Ireland, Dutchland,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> A
Description of the <HI>Wind.</HI> The Number, Division, and Nature of the
Winds. The new Division of the Horizon into 32 Parts, by the learned
Hydrographers, seemingly in our Author's Time; who here disposes them
into a <HI>Type</HI> or <HI>Figure.</HI> Of the Mariners <HI>Compass,</HI>
unknown to the Ancients, found out by <HI>Gemma,</HI> and a Draught of it. The
Praise of the <HI>Needle</HI>; the Observations of <HI>Jofrancus</HI> in
what Places it has erred. How to correct the Needle in Day-time, by help of the
Sun; in the Night, by some fixed Star. Of the Errors in describing the
Shipman's Chart, and the way how to sail by Longitudes and Latitudes. How to
direct a Ship to any Port. How to know the Form of the Lode-Star; and to know
in what Place they are who are driven <PB N="33" REF="56"/> from their Course.
With these Discoveries and Directions in Cosmography, Geography, and
Navigation, our Author ends this fourth Book.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fifth Book</HI> describes the Parts of the Earth,
particu∣larly according to late Observations; with the <HI>Longitudes</HI>
and <HI>Latitudes</HI> of Regions, Provinces, Islands, Cities, Towns,
Villages, and Hills: Also the Commodities, Natures, Laws, Rights, and
Customs of many Countries, and their Inhabi∣tants. This begins with a
particular Description of <HI>Europe,</HI> containing <HI>Christendom</HI>
and part of <HI>Turky</HI>; beginning with <HI>Ireland,</HI> as
<HI>Ptolemy</HI> does: In which, after a short Account of the Products and
Character of the People, and Dimen∣sions of the Island, he notes the chief
Places, with their Longitude and Latitude: So proceeds to <HI>England,</HI>
which is treated of in the same manner. Then <HI>Scotland, Iceland,
Corsica, Sicily, Sardinia, Majorca</HI> and <HI>Minorca, Gades, Eu∣boea,
Crete,</HI> the <HI>Cyclades</HI> and <HI>Sporades.</HI> In such like

the prin∣cipal Places therein. <HI>Asia,</HI> after the same manner, is
next described; and lastly, such parts of <HI>America</HI> as are by

But we have not yet met with any more of this Author's Writing, printed by him,
how many soever he had ready for the Press; which perhaps may be accounted

<BIBL><HI>A short Discovery of the unobserved Dangers of
several sorts of ignorant and unconsiderate Practisers of</HI>

Multitude, and easie for their mean Capacities, but raising reformed and

Cotta <HI>of</HI> Northampton, <HI>Dr. in Physicke,</HI> 4to. 1612. pages
135.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS Tract was the Product chiefly of that ten Years Observation
and Experience which our Author had in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> as he
informs us in his Dedication to the Gentry thereof, among whom he was first
introduced by his honoured Friend, Sir <HI>William Tate,</HI> as therein also
ap∣pears. Not but the said Frauds and Corruptions in Physick were
epidemical enough to have mov'd him to the like Ani∣madversions, had he
resided in any other part of the Nation. For as he says, in his
<HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Reader</HI>; 
<Q REND="inline">"So infinitely do the numbers of barbarous and
unlearned <HI>Counsellors of Health</HI> at this time overspread all
Corners of this Kingdom, that their confused Swarms do not only every where
cover and eclipse the Sun-shine of all true Learning and Under∣standing,
but generally darken and extinguish the very Light of common Sense and
Reason."</Q> Therefore, both in duty to the common Good, and to the
Sollicitations of his Friends, he presents us with 
<Q REND="inline">"this needful Detection of harmful Succours, and
necessary Council for safe Supply."</Q> He proposes to suit the
meanest Readers with the Plainness and Simplicity of a familiar Stile; and
to keep the Current of the Text clear from all Quotation of ancient
<HI>Languages,</HI> referring only the learned to the Margin; which latter, he
has observed through every Page. His Method further, is to illustrate his
general Cautions and Rules with particular Cases and Reports, drawn chiefly
from those Parts where he now practised and resided, as an Inducement to
read, and an Enticement to continue, Example being neither least pleasing
nor least profitable to the Vulgar.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="58"/>The Work itself is open'd with an
<HI>Introduction,</HI> shewing, how desirable, but how difficult it is, to
meet with an able Physician, thro' the variety of Causes and
Circumstances to be consider'd in Diseases, and the Application of
Remedies; with the ill Consequences of the common Neglect and Igno∣rance
herein, and the monopolizing of Cures to the Pre∣rogative of this or that
Secret, to the Contempt of the due Permutation of Medicines and the Increase
of Diseases, both beyond their own Nature, and the Constitutions of the
Sick. Here, among those Things, the indiscriminate use of which he
discommends, are mention'd Tobacco, and Quicksilver, and even Cassia,
and Rhubarb, which being indiscreetly, out of time and place dispenced,
bring Mischief instead of Good; with other Instances here produced, both
of internal and external Remedies, most sovereign and renowned in
themselves, which yet do bring forth effects unworthy of themselves, and
all because such a promiscuous and unskilful Rabble of the meanest
Mechanicks, Women, Priests, Witches, Conjurers, Jugglers, and
Fortune-Tellers, are suffer'd to become Medicine-Mongers, and make a gainful
Traffic of Homicide it self. That not only the Simple but those also of
better Sort are deluded to encourage such Preten∣ders, on account of some
casual Success; but, says our Author, 
<Q REND="inline">"As in Military Designs, oft-times a bold and
fool-hardy Enterprize, above and beside Reason, and beyond Ex∣pectation,
produceth an excellent and admir'd Good in the happy Issue; yet it is not
commended, or in any case permitted, as being very dangerous in ordinary
Practice, or Custom of Warfare: so likewise, divers Events of Me∣dicines
prove good, whose bold Use and rash Prescription is dangerous and
unskilful"</Q> He concludes this Chapter with observing, That as improper
Remedies are, for the most part, worse than Diseases, and unlearned
Physicians, of all bad Causes of Diseases, are themselves the
worst; it is not there∣fore a needless Learning, more studiously to
know the Good from Ill and Ill from Good; beginning with the last first,
in</P>
<P>Chap. 2. <HI>Of the Emperick.</HI> Herein is described, what an
Emperick is; in what his Defects consist. The Assistance of
Invention; of Experience, and what a circumscribed Guide of it self. 
<Q REND="inline">"For as it is with the Soldier in the Field, let
his own special Experience in Arms be never so an∣cient, so true, so
sound, yet without a more general Un∣derstanding or Theory, and a more
enlarged Knowledge than his particular and limited Experience can bring forth, 
<PB N="36" REF="59"/> he must be lamely fitted to many sudden and oft before
unforeseen Occurrents, which the perpetual Mutability and Change of
Circumstances in Warfare must needs produce. The Field, the Enemy, the Time
(not always the same) require a divers and oft a contrary Consultation,
Design, and Manner, wherein one particular Experience by it self, cannot
but be much wanting, because the same Thing or Action seldom or never
happens again the same in all Circumstances; and one Circumstance alone
com∣monly altering the whole Condition. As it is in Military Affairs, so is
it in the Assaults of Diseases, where the Fight and Wrestling of
Nature is not always in the same Part, nor in the same Form or Manner, nor
with the same Disease, nor of the same Period: All which
Circum∣stances in the same Subject cannot happen always to any Sight or
Sense the same, which makes Experience; yet are ever present in the
general Notions of the Under∣standing, whereby the prudent and wise Man
doth make supply, tho' Experience fail."</Q> Besides, many Diseases
a∣rise in the Body of Man which are scarce seen in a Man's Life, and in
which, Experience can give no Prescription. Here are mentioned, the
<HI>French</HI> Disease and the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> strange to us once, and
the <HI>English Sweating-Sickness,</HI> so now. To these are added,
some more singular and un∣common Accidents, as <HI>Rulandus</HI> his Report
of the Golden Tooth which grew naturally in the Mouth of a Child. Also
another Child, in <HI>Hollerus,</HI> who thrust its hand out of its Mother's
Navel for 15 Days, and was afterwards born alive, and the Mother safe.
Also, <HI>Brasavola</HI>'s Cure of the Soldier who had almost half his
Head cut away with part of his Brains. Hence he descends to several
Examples and Cases of his own Observation in <HI>Northamptonshire</HI>;
and con∣cludes, from them, that every Day almost, may pose bare and naked
Experience, especially when Empericks apply it to similar Appearances: 
<Q REND="inline">"For, with the Wise, the <HI>like,</HI> is much
unlike the <HI>same</HI>; and it is a chief Point in all Learning, truly to
discern between differing Similitudes and like Differences. Many Accidents
fall out seeming alike, yet have no Affinity; and again, in Shew the same,
yet indeed, contrary. Contraries have oft, in many things, Likeness; and
Likeness, Contraries, easily deceiving the Unwotting and Unlearned."</Q>
This again is proved by many Instances, tending to demonstrate the
Imperfections of their Practice, who use no light of Judgment or Reason, 
<PB N="37" REF="60"/> but the only Sense of their own Experience. With regard
also to whom, our Author says a little further, 
<Q REND="inline">"I wou'd it were a Slander, in these days, that
Good-Will and excel∣lent Medicines, put to death more Lives than open Mur∣der;"
and thinks "it would be happy, if at length, the common Inconvenience and
publick Scandal might be∣get a Law, and Law bring forth Restraint."</Q> Here
also we have many Instances how helpless or hurtful good Medi∣cines are,
when apply'd without Distinction of proper Cir∣cumstances, Concomitancies,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> intended to caution us against putting any confidence in the
Excellency of any Re∣medies, without Advice for the right Dispensation of
them, and consequently, against relying upon the many Books of
<HI>Physical Receipts</HI> and Apothecaries Shops in print, which were then
divulged in all Places; wise and discreet Men knowing, that Things without
Reason in themselves, are by Reason and Wisdom to be guided.</P>
<P>Chap. 3. is <HI>Of the Practice of</HI> Women <HI>about the Sick;
common-visiting Counsellors, and Commenders of Medicines.</HI> Wherein, as
vulgar Pretenders were before exclaimed a∣gainst, for want of proper
Education and Knowledge, Pa∣tients are, for the same Reason, warned
against consulting with <HI>Petticoat Practitioners</HI>; who are rather
advised to pre∣scribe Rules of <HI>Conduct</HI> to themselves, than
<HI>Physick</HI> to their Friends; as what would free them from the
Unhappiness of having their Hands so commonly in others Mishaps, to the
Dishonour of their own Sex; by intimidating the Sick with Doubts, and
dissuading them, if not from Physick ab∣solutely, yet from the regular
Composition and Use of it; from all that is not of their own making, or of
which they have not had Tryal; as their own Ointments, Plaisters,
Cear-Cloths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> often beguiling them with the dangerous Flattery
of harmless and palatable Medicines, proving, that old <HI>Eve</HI> will
never be worn out of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Children; and not seldom rendring it
incredible that such mean sort of People can get acquaintance with such
dangerous Medicines as are here also specified; but that Quacksalvers,
Bankrupt Apothecaries, and fugitive Surgeons, who every where over∣spread the
Kingdom, are compelled for gain, to communi∣cate such Secrets, whereby
desperate Ingredients and Experi∣ments grow vulgar Medicaments.
Therefore,</P>
<P>Chap. 4. Treats of <HI>Fugitives, Workers of Juggling Won∣ders,
and Quacksalvers.</HI> Under this Head, we have a running Description of
the Impostors here named. 
<Q REND="inline">"Among these <PB N="38" REF="61"/> Men, says
he, "credulous Minds may see Things invisible, Beggars are enabled to
sell Gold to drink, that want Silver to make them eat. <HI>Aurum
Potabile</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our Author, Dr. <HI>Cotta,</HI> (who was
educated at <HI>Cambridge</HI>) here reflects upon Dr. <HI>Fra Anthonie,</HI>
who at this time was noted for his <HI>Universal Medicine</HI> called
<HI>Aurum Potabile,</HI> whereof he publish'd a Book about four Years after,
and our Author an <HI>An∣swer</HI> to it, as may be seen in <HI>Athen.
Oxon.</HI></NOTE>, the <HI>Natural Bal∣samum,</HI> the <HI>Philosopher's
Stone, dissolved Pearl,</HI> and the like inestimable Glories and Pride
of Art and Nature are their professed ordinary Creatures, and the
Workmanship of their Hands; in whose hands are nothing but Idleness,
Theft, and Beggary."</Q> He concludes this Head with intimating, that
Pretenders to such uncommon Performan∣ces, are to be suspected of wanting
even common Suffi∣ciency. That God has not ordain'd Wonders and Miracles to
give supply to our common Needs, or to answer the or∣dinary Occasions of
Life; nor do Truth and Sufficiency re∣ceive their just Trial by rare Works,
or casual Events, but by an habitual and continual Proof and Exercise in
their daily, ordinary, and proper Subjects and Occurrents.</P>
<P>Chap. 5. is, <HI>Of Surgeons</HI>; and such as esteeming well
of themselves for the Exercise of their Hands in Wounds, Am∣putations,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> arrogate a Privilege in the Practice of Phy∣sick; and even
undertake to educate and institute Physicians, as an Undergrowth to
themselves; and that thus also the World is furnished with Factors for
the Grave. Hereof he produces Examples, manifesting, by the Practice of
these Barber-Surgeons, how confident Ignorance will be, and how powerfully it
will infatuate the Distressed. And here again is arraign'd, the Custom
of giving the same Medicine to different Constitutions. Whence, says our
Author, 
<Q REND="inline">"How can he who considers the Disease and
not the Per∣son, in curing the one, but in danger the other?"</Q> A little
farther he lays down the plain and uncontrolled Difference between the Learned
and the Unlearned in the Faculty; and shews how the Learned has a Prerogative
in three Parts to himself, and an equal Part with the Unlearned, in the
fourth; yet allows, that in many desperate Cases, the Igno∣rant by their
Blindness, their Boldness, and their Luck, may be the only fit
Instruments. Here we have also Examples how wonderous Good oft issues
out of devilish and dange∣rous Acts; yet if the Unskilful fail, the hopeful
Use of any <PB N="39" REF="62"/> other Means is commonly thereby over-run, and
the Hap∣piness of After-health by better Council, frustrated. Hence we are
led to</P>
<P>Chap. 6. Of <HI>Apothecaries:</HI> To whom thus much is al∣low'd;
That if any may have Prerogative to be Physicians by the Excellence and rare
Choice of Medicines, it is most proper unto them. Nay, 'tis further allow'd,
that for the excellent Preparation and Knowledge of Medicines, they sometimes
may excel some Physicians themselves. 
<Q REND="inline">"But above and beyond the Preparation; the right
and judicious Dispensation is truly worthy, commanding and directing
therein safe and prudent Use. This Skill requires an Un∣derstanding able
to raise itself above both the Medicine and the Maker, unto the Great Maker
of them both, and from his general Decree and Council in the Adminis∣tration
of all things in Nature, to levy and limit Circum∣stances, Proportion, Time,
Place, Quantity, and Qua∣lity, according to the manifold Purposes and
infinite Uses for the Preservation, Conservation, and Conti∣nuance of
Health and Life to Mankind."</Q> So far as the Apothecaries keep within their
own proper Bounds, they cannot be denied a worthy Esteem; but if the Pride
and Mastership of the Medicine stir once in them the Ambition of
Medication, they will be justly condemned. A little further the Question is
proposed, whether a Physician should be both Surgeon and Apothecary
himself. And it is allow'd that in Judgment, Skill, Knowledge, and Ability of
Direc∣tion, it may be requisite; but the particular Execution should be
divided to others, whose continual Exercise therein makes them fitter for
it; and this Chapter is concluded with some further Remarks to the same
Purpose.</P>
<P>Chap. 7. <HI>Of Practisers by Spells.</HI> Among the Arguments
here used against these Deluders, is this, 
<Q REND="inline">"If the faithful and devout Prayer of Holy Men, to
which the Promise of God and Blessings of Men are annexed, has no such
As∣surance or Success of necessary Consequent, without la∣borious
Industry and the use of good Means, how can Religion or Reason suffer
Men who are not void of both to give such impious Credit unto an
insignificant and senseless Mumbling of idle Words, contrary to
Reason, without Precedent of any truly wise or learned, and justly
suspected of all sensibe Men?"</Q></P>
<P>Chap. 8. <HI>Of Witchcraft in the Sick,</HI> &amp;c. Herein are
va∣rious Arguments advanced, to prove there are many things <PB N="40" REF="63"/> whereof few Men, many whereof no Man can attain the Reason, yet
every Man knoweth to have a Reason in Nature. That Casualty oft apts
Consequences to Dreams, yet it is no Proof of Truth to trust in them. That
Women in their Sleep have foreseen or foretold many Things which have come to
pass, but this makes their Dreams no Oracles; and many vain Men have
confidently predicted such Things as have happen'd, yet are not taken for
Prophets. In like man∣ner, some who have possess'd themselves with
Witchcraft and the Opinion thereof, have seemed to know Things a∣bove their
Knowledge, and That Knowledge above and beyond all Reason hath been true. Yet
neither is this any Dispossession of themselves of this Spirit of
Folly, nor just Proof or Accusation of any one to be a Witch. Our Author
does not deny or defend devilish Practices of Men and Women, but desires
only 
<Q REND="inline">"to moderate the general Madness of this Age,
which ascribes to Witchcraft what∣soever falls out unknown or strange to
a vulgar Sense."</Q> Therefore, concerning Diseases, there are here set
forth some strange and particular Cases, which had undergone unjust
Imputations of this kind; and one especially, of a Gentlewoman, whom certain
Witches, lately executed for Sorcery, confess'd to have bewitch'd; tho' her
Malady was only a natural Complication of divers Disorders, chiefly
convulsive, which produced a Concourse of Accidents, seeming of
monstrous and wondered Shapes. Upon this, says our Author, I grant the
voluntary and uncompelled, or duly and truly evicted Confession of a
<HI>Witch,</HI> to be sufficient Condemnation of herself, and therefore,
justly hath the Law laid their Blood upon their own Heads; but their
Confession, I cannot conceive sufficient Eviction of the
<HI>Witchcraft</HI> itself; and this Topic is conluded with Arguments and
Cautions further to the same Purpose.</P>
<P>Chap. 9. <HI>Of Wisards.</HI> These are described to be a
sort of Practitioners, whom our Custom and Country call Wise Men, and
Wise Women, reputed a kind of honest harmless Witches or Wisards, who,
by good Words, hallowed Herbs, Salves, and other superstitious Ceremonies,
promise to allay and calm De∣vils, Practices of other Witches, and the Force
of many Dis∣eases. But these being much of the same Nature with those
before mentioned to use Spells, are referred unto them, and dismiss'd
with a short History of our Author's Observation.</P>
<P>Chap. 10. <HI>Of Servants to Physicians and ministring
Help∣ers.</HI> Our Author concludes his Number and Distinction 
<PB N="41" REF="64"/> of <HI>Empericks</HI> with this Tribe; who are such as
either by oft serving Physicians, or conversing with them and viewing
their Practice, or by Employment from their Directions, or by Attendance about
the Sick, engross to themselves sup∣posed special Observations and
choice Remedies; and with such small Ware, taken upon credit, set up for
themselves. Here the Insufficiency of such apish Imitation is
descanted upon, and this kind of second-hand Use of other People's
Practice; shewing, in several Aphoristical Observations how unsafe
such Experience in Physick is; as 
<Q REND="inline">"how necessary it is, That Man should be in
himself a Master of Know∣ledge and sincere Judgment, who shall be able
truely to make right Use of another's Experience."</Q> And even 
<Q REND="inline">"That which Experience has once, or oft times
known and found to do good, must not therefore, in necessity, still do
the same good, except the same Reason of the good, do, in each
Circumstance, again commend and command it; which only they can judge and
examine who are wise and learned."</Q> With other like Reflections therefore
on this preposterous Practice; and a Detail of such Abilities and
Application as are requisite for attaining a suf∣ficiency in this
Profession, our Author concludes this Chap∣ter, and therewith the
<HI>First Book</HI> of this <HI>Treatise:</HI> The fore∣going Extracts from
which, being sufficient to give a Taste of the Performance, we shall, for
brevity sake, only give the Titles of the two ensuing Books, which are as
follows.</P>
<P>Book II. Chapter 1. <HI>The Methodian learned Deceiver, or
Heretick Physician.</HI> Chapter 2. <HI>Of Beneficed Practisers.</HI>
Chapter 3. <HI>Of Astrologers and Ephemerides Masters.</HI> Chap∣ter 4.
<HI>Of Conjectors by Urine.</HI> Chapter 5. <HI>Of Travellers.</HI> Which ends
this Book.</P>

<P>THE Author of this learned Book has, with great La∣bour, join'd
many dispersed Rarities of Art under se∣veral Heads; with much Modesty,
brought a great deal of Reading into a little Compass; and, withall, omitted
to pre∣fix his Name to it. Yet, in justice to his Memory, we have been
obliged with it by another Hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anthony Wood</HI>
ascribes it to Dr. <HI>Tho. Powell,</HI> Canon of <HI>St. David's,</HI> who
was, says he, an able Philosopher, a curious Cri∣tic, and well vers'd in
various Languages. He died in <HI>London, Dec.</HI> 31, 1660.</NOTE>. There is
a short Preface or Advertisement to the Reader, seemingly by the
Bookseller, in Commendation of the Work; wherein he says, <HI>You will
imagine yourself, even among the</HI> Mechanic Arts, <HI>to be conversant
in the</HI> Liberal. Tho' from the Defect of the alphabetical Catalogue,
intended at the beginning, of the principal Authors mention'd in this Work;
with some Errors in the Table of Contents, and the Omissions in the Index
of any Reference to the Pages; we might, alone, without any other Knowledge of
the Author, or the time when he died, have presumed he did not supervise
the Press, yet are those Imperfections of little moment, because the Work
is concise.</P>
<P>The Book itself is divided into twelve Chapters, in the
following Order.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Of the Invention of Dials, Clocks, Watches, and other
Time-Tellers.</HI> Here, speaking of the Division of Time, he tells you,
whence the Name of <HI>Horae</HI> or Hours, was derived according to
<HI>Macrobius,</HI> and how the Day was divided into twenty-four Hours
according to the <HI>Egyptians</HI>; of the <HI>Clyp∣sidrae</HI> or
Water-glasses; of the Way to make the Motion of Time visible and audible,
first by the Invention of <HI>Sun-Dials</HI>; with an Observation from
<HI>Busbequius,</HI> that the <HI>Turks</HI> <PB N="43" REF="66"/> have no
Distinction of Miles or Hours; and that among the <HI>Persians,</HI> their
Bellies were their Dials; upon what Defects the Invention of Engines by the
<HI>Trochilic</HI> Art, or that of Wheels arose, and that <HI>Severinus
Boetius</HI> was the first who contrived any Engine of this sort. Then as
to their Va∣riety; some being mute, some vocal, some so small as to
be worn in Rings, for making whereof, in <HI>Italy,</HI> our Coun∣tryman
<HI>George Whitehead</HI> is celebrated by <HI>Schottus</HI> in his Itinerary.
Then of <HI>Andrew Alciat</HI>'s Clock, which was both Larum and Tinder-Box. Of
Astronomical Clocks; that at <HI>Prague,</HI> serving also as an Almanac:
That at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> more particularly describ'd in <HI>Coriat</HI>'s
Travels. The strange alphabetical Globe of our Countryman <HI>Linne,</HI> a
Jesuit of <HI>Liege,</HI> which in a Water-glass would turn to an Index
every Hour, according to the Accounts of <HI>Kercher, de magnete,</HI> and
<HI>Gassendus</HI> in the Life of <HI>Peiriscus.</HI> The no less
strange Cork of the said <HI>Kercher,</HI> which, with Seeds of the
Helio∣trope in it, would also in Water keep Course with the Sun. He gives
us one more Description of a Saddle-Clock, at <HI>Dresden,</HI> from
<HI>Morysin</HI>'s Travels: So concludes this Head with a <HI>Latin</HI>
Epigram, by <HI>Tho. Campian,</HI> on a Watch, with the Translation by
<HI>H.V.</HI> i. e. <HI>Vaughan.</HI> And an Observation from <HI>Tycho
Brahe</HI> on a Defect in all Clocks and Watches; in Watches, for that the
first half Hour goes faster than the last, because Springs, wound up,
move faster in the begin∣ning; and in Clocks, the last half Hour is
faster than the first, because their Weights move flower at first, and
ac∣celerate as they draw nearer the Earth.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Of some curious Spheres, and Representations of
the World.</HI> This Chapter is introduced with a Praise of
<HI>Ar∣chimedes,</HI> and <HI>Claudian</HI>'s Epigram on his Coelestial
Sphere, with a Translation of it by Mr. <HI>Nath. Carpenter.</HI> Of King
<HI>Sapor's</HI> Glass-Sphere. The Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s silver
Heaven, which he presented to <HI>Solyman,</HI> as mention'd by <HI>Paul
Jovius Sabellicus,</HI> and <HI>Dubartas.</HI> Among the Moderns, <HI>Cornelius
Van Drebble</HI> of <HI>Alcmar,</HI> is much admir'd: He liv'd in
<HI>England,</HI> had a gold Chain sent him by the Emperor, and was <HI>Regi
Jacobo à Mechanicis,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> his Engi∣neer: He
presented that King with a <HI>Perpetual Motion,</HI> which is here
describ'd; and a Draught or Figure of it, re∣ferr'd to in Mr. <HI>Tho.
Tims</HI>'s <HI>Philosophical Dialogue.</HI> He is praised by <HI>Marcellus
Vrankheim,</HI> in an Epistle, and his said Microcosm by
<HI>Grotius,</HI> in a <HI>Latin</HI> Epigram, which you have here recited with
<HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Translation: So concludes <PB N="42" REF="67"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="44" REF="69"/> with an
Account of <HI>Erasmus</HI> his gold Ring, which had a Coelestial Sphere in
it, and some Devices of <HI>Janellus Tur∣rianus</HI> of <HI>Cremona,</HI>
with which he used to recreate the Em∣peror <HI>Charles</HI> V. as his brazen
Heavens, his little Armies of Horse and Foot, his wooden Sparrows, Iron-Mill
that turn'd itself, and would grind as much Wheat in a Day as would suffice
eight Persons, with his Water-Works, whereby he drew up the River
<HI>Tagus</HI> to the top of the Mountain of <HI>To∣ledo,</HI> as we have it in
<HI>Strada</HI>'s History of the <HI>Low-Country</HI> Wars.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Of sundry Machines, and artificial Motions by
Water and Air.</HI> In this, having admir'd the wonderful Creation of the
greater World and the lesser, and instanced how many useful Machines
and artificial Motions have been framed after those two primary
<HI>Automata</HI> that God him∣self made, he enumerates several Engineers,
ancient and modern, who have been famous for such Works; then pro∣ceeds to
treat, first, of <HI>Wind-Motions,</HI> whereof, after men∣tioning what
<HI>Baptista Porta</HI> and <HI>Marinus Mersennus</HI> had written upon
this Subject, he gives Examples in the wooden Dove of <HI>Architas,</HI> the
wooden Eagle of <HI>Regiomontanus,</HI> and his Iron Fly, the sailing Chariot
of <HI>Simon Stevinius,</HI> which would carry eight or nine Persons above
forty Miles in two Hours. 'Twas in the fashion of a Boat, with four Wheels
and two Sails. It was much admir'd by <HI>Peireskius</HI> accord∣ing to
<HI>Gassendus</HI>; and here are two Epigrams of <HI>Grotius</HI> upon it,
with their Translations. Then we have Accounts of Statues, walking and
speaking, and the artificial Animals which <HI>Luitprandus</HI> saw at
<HI>Constantinople</HI>; the Statue of <HI>Al∣bert Magnus,</HI> Friar
<HI>Bacon</HI>'s brazen Head, and the vocal I∣mage in King <HI>Richard</HI> the
Second's Reign, whereof Sir <HI>R. Baker</HI> speaks: Then of <HI>Cornelius
Van Drebble</HI>'s Organ, which would play of itself, in the open Air and
clear Sun∣shine, but be silent in the Shade: The Mill that would saw
Boards without Hands, at <HI>Dantzick</HI>; and such another, which Dr.
<HI>John Dee</HI> saw at <HI>Prague,</HI> as he mentions himself. Then he
speaks of the <HI>Wind-Guns, Aeolii Scopoli,</HI> to discharge without
Powder, and <HI>Aeoliae Pilae</HI> or <HI>Wind-Balls,</HI> to blow up or kindle
Fires; and <HI>Wind-Spits,</HI> according to the Ac∣count of <HI>Cardan.</HI>
Then he comes to <HI>Water-Motions,</HI> and here mentions the curious Mills at
<HI>Thoulouse</HI> and <HI>Dantzick,</HI> from the Accounts of
<HI>Golnitz</HI> and <HI>Morison</HI>; also the Mint at <HI>Segovia,</HI>
which perform'd the several Operations of coin∣ing by a Water-Engine, as Sir
<HI>K. Digby</HI> relates; the Statues <PB N="45" REF="70"/> in the Duke of
<HI>Florence</HI>'s Garden, with their various Motions and Harmony, also the
Birds at <HI>Tivoli</HI> which sing by the same <HI>Hydraulic</HI> Art. Of
Water-Organs, and the vast Sce∣nery of Woods, Beasts, Waters, and Shipping
in the <HI>Roman</HI> Amphitheatres. The <HI>Versatile</HI> Dining-Rooms,
where every Course is eaten in a different Chamber, the Guests never
removing from their Seats. Next is mentioned the por∣table Palace, carried to
<HI>France</HI> for the Interview between <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and
<HI>Francis</HI> I. which so many Writers have spoken of (tho' we think not
that it is here placed under its proper Head) and lastly a more distinct
Account of <HI>Mem∣non</HI>'s Statue, its musical Property, even when it was
broke; and the Conjecture of <HI>Kircher</HI> that it was made by
<HI>Talisma∣nic</HI> Art<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this Art see <HI>Marcil
Ficinus de Vitâ coelitus comparanda, Jos. Scaliger Epist.</HI> and
<HI>Gregory</HI>'s <HI>Opuscula.</HI></NOTE>, tho' he shews that such
Effects might be pro∣duced by Mathematical Contrivance in his <HI>Oedipus,</HI>
where more Examples may be seen of <HI>Pneumatical</HI> Devices among the
<HI>Aegyptians</HI> in their Temples.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Of the Art and Mystery of Writing, with the
Instruments.</HI></P>
<P>This he begins with shewing what a vast number of dif∣ferent
ways the Alphabet may be joined according to <HI>Clavius.</HI> That the
<HI>Chinese</HI> have 40000 Letters according to <HI>Purchas,</HI> and that
the <HI>Indians</HI> admir'd this dumb Commerce, so as to believe that
Letters were Spirits, or a kind of <HI>Internuncii</HI> between the
Correspondents; and to this sense quotes <HI>Tho. Readi Inventa
adespota.</HI> Of the Invention attributed to <HI>Cad∣mus</HI> by the
<HI>Phoenicians,</HI> as we have it in <HI>Ausonius</HI> and <HI>Her∣mannus
Hugo.</HI> Of the admirable Perfection which the an∣cient <HI>Librarians</HI>
arrived to in the Art of Writing, and seve∣ral Examples of their Performance
in Miniature, particularly that of <HI>Fra. Alumnus,</HI> according to the
Testimony of <HI>Gene∣brand</HI> and <HI>Sim. Maiolus. Pliny</HI>'s Account
of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Iliad</HI> in a Nut-shell, and <HI>Cicero</HI>'s
Confirmation, however <HI>Lancelotti</HI> reckons it among his
<HI>Farfalloni.</HI> Of <HI>Tho. Sweicker,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Writer with
his Feet, and how choicely some Copies of his said Writing are kept,
according to <HI>Fel. Platerus</HI>; and of an <HI>English</HI> Woman who
wrote in the same manner. Of <HI>Brachygraphy</HI> or <HI>Short-hand</HI> for
Speed and Privacy; invented by <HI>Mecaenas</HI> according to <HI>Dion,</HI>
and used by <HI>Cicero.</HI> Of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>'s invention, which
was a kind of <HI>Cryptography,</HI> by Transposure of the Alphabet. That
the <HI>Instruments</HI> are <HI>active</HI> and <HI>passive</HI>; being
those <HI>wherewith</HI> and those <HI>whereon</HI> we write. And first,
of those whereon we write, as Stone, <PB N="46" REF="71"/> on which the old
<HI>Jewish</HI> Law was wrote, and some antique <HI>Danish</HI> Records,
as mentioned by <HI>Selden</HI> in <HI>Marmora Arun∣dell.</HI> Then on Leaves
of Trees, as the <HI>Sybils</HI> Books and the <HI>Indians,</HI> whence the
word <HI>Folio.</HI> On Lead, as in <HI>Job,</HI> and the Poems of
<HI>Hesiod</HI> in <HI>Pausanias,</HI> and on the inner Rhind of Trees,
whence the words <HI>Liber, Caudex</HI> and <HI>Codex.</HI> On Papyr Reeds, as
in <HI>Isaiah,</HI> whence Paper; which Reed was called <HI>Biblus,</HI>
whence <HI>Biblia.</HI> On Tables of Brass, as the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws; on
Waxen Tables, whence <HI>Tabellarii</HI> or Letter-Carriers; which Tables are
mentioned in St. <HI>Luke</HI> and in <HI>Isaiah</HI>; and in the
<HI>Septuagint</HI> called Box-Tables, also sometimes made of Cedar-Wood.
Of the Invention of Vellum and Parchment by <HI>Eumenes</HI> King of
<HI>Pergamus.</HI> And lastly, of our modern Paper, with Lord
<HI>Bacon</HI>'s Obser∣vations on the Excellence of the said Invention. Of
the Cotton Paper in <HI>Mexico,</HI> and Silk Paper in the
<HI>East-Indies.</HI> Next of the <HI>Active Instruments,</HI> as the
Finger of God on the Tables of Stone; Graving Tools for Metals, and Dia∣monds
for Glass; the <HI>Stylus</HI> for Waxen Tables; the Reed, called <HI>Calamus
Scriptorius</HI> and <HI>Arundo,</HI> for writing on the Papyr Seggs about
<HI>Memphis,</HI> as mentioned in <HI>Martial</HI>; and lastly, the Quill of
a Bird's Wing for Parchment and Paper, called by <HI>Ausonius,
Fissipes,</HI> from the Slit made in it to let down the Ink; and four Lines
in its Praise by <HI>Barlaeus de Penna</HI>; with the notice taken of these
three last in an old Chronicle. Of writing with corroding Waters, by the
Cut∣lers of <HI>Damascus,</HI> on the <HI>Turkish</HI> Scimeters, and of
the long lasting of a Pen, in the Example of Dr. <HI>Holland</HI>'s the
Phy∣sician of <HI>Coventry,</HI> wherewith he translated all
<HI>Pliny</HI>'s <HI>Natu∣ral History</HI> into <HI>English</HI>; which
therefore was preserved by a Lady, as a great Rarity in a Silver Case; and
<HI>Ovid</HI>'s Silver Pen, which being found in some Ruins, was given to the
Queen of <HI>Hungary</HI> in 1540, according to Mr. <HI>Sandys,</HI> in the
Life of that Poet.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Of Printing and Printing-Presses.</HI> Here we
have the Commendations of <HI>Pol. Virgil, Cardan,</HI> and <HI>Read</HI>
before mentioned, in Prose and Verse, of this Art. The Conten∣tion of
<HI>higher</HI> and <HI>lower Germany</HI> for the Invention of it. The general
Voice for <HI>Mentz,</HI> and <HI>John Guttemberg,</HI> or <HI>Fust</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The learned Dr. <HI>Will. Cuningham,</HI> who was in these
parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> in or before the Year 1559, and conversant with
the most learned Men there, says in his foregoing Treatise, fol. 181. 
<Q REND="inline">"That at this City of <HI>Mentz</HI> was the Art
of Printing first found by <HI>John Faustus,</HI> in the Year of Christ
our Saviour 1453."</Q></NOTE>, about the Year 1440, according to
<HI>Polydore.</HI> The <PB N="47" REF="72"/> Evidence of the <HI>Tully</HI>'s
<HI>Offices</HI> cited by <HI>Salmuth</HI> upon <HI>Pan∣cirollus,</HI> another
Instance from the Library at <HI>Francfort</HI>; with the Opposition of
<HI>Adrian Junius,</HI> who would carry it from the <HI>High Dutch,</HI> and
make the Town of <HI>Harlem</HI> its Birth-place, and <HI>Laurence-John</HI>
(<HI>Coster</HI>) the Inventor, from his Rudiments thereof carved out of the
Barks of Trees, which <HI>Junius</HI> saw in that Town; with his Account how
<HI>John Faustus</HI> stole away <HI>Coster</HI>'s Letters and
Utensils, and settling at <HI>Mentz</HI> printed the <HI>Doctrinal</HI> of
<HI>Alex. Gallus</HI> 1440. Also the Description over <HI>Coster</HI>'s
House, justifying the same, and <HI>Pet. Scriverius</HI> his Confirmation
thereof, with <HI>Jo. Scaliger</HI>'s Account of the first Printing from
Wooden Tables. That the <HI>Chinese</HI> may plead Antiquity for the
In∣vention, according to <HI>P. Maffaeus,</HI> and that they have prac∣tised
the Art above 500 Years, as <HI>Trigaultius</HI> affirms, but differently from
the <HI>Europeans</HI>; for they do not compose by Letters, but make for
every Leaf a Table, with Charac∣ters on both sides, as <HI>Gonsalvo
Mendoza</HI> observes. So that the Invention of the modern manner may still
be allowed in honour of the <HI>Germans.</HI> Our Author then mentions a
<HI>Latin</HI> Poem written in praise of this Art (which it well deserves,
being the Preserver of all other Arts) by Mrs. <HI>Joan. Eliza∣beth
Weston,</HI> one of the Muses of <HI>England.</HI> And lastly gives a
description of <HI>Christopher Plantin</HI>'s Printing-House, his twelve
Presses, and near 100 sorts of Characters, besides Frontispieces,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and tells us that the first Printing-Press in
<HI>England</HI> was set up in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> by <HI>Simon
Islip, An.</HI> 1471. where <HI>William Caxton</HI> first practised the
Art, as <HI>Stow</HI> affirms in his <HI>Survey of London.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Of the Art of Limning and Painting.</HI> This
Chapter commences with Praises of the Art by Sir <HI>Henry Wotton,</HI> St
<HI>Gregory,</HI> &amp;c. The Reason why <HI>Death's Dance</HI> was painted
in the Church at <HI>Basil.</HI> How simple the Art was at first,
according to <HI>Aelian,</HI> but encreased to ten Colours, as
<HI>Bu∣lenger</HI> observes; who it was added the <HI>Ethick</HI> part of
Paint∣ing, and first expressed the Passions. The Excellence of
<HI>Apelles</HI> and <HI>Protogenes, Zeuxes</HI> and <HI>Parrhasius,</HI> the
Virgin <HI>Lala</HI> and <HI>Renè</HI> King of <HI>Sicily.</HI> Of
some modern Rarities; as, the representing in one Piece several Faces
according to different Position or Standing, by pleated Paper, and in∣denting
or folding of the Table; others that shewed the Head of a <HI>Spaniard</HI>
one way, another way, that of an Ass; a <PB N="48" REF="73"/> third in the
Chancellor of <HI>France</HI>'s Cabinet, which presented many little Faces,
his Ancestors, to the vulgar Eye; but, thro' a Perspective, the single
Portrait only of the Owner, according to Sir <HI>Rich. Fanshaw</HI> in the
<HI>Epist.</HI> before his Translat. of <HI>Pastor Fido.</HI> Of Painting
in Oil; with the Art of Sculpture and Engraving. Of other Perspective Pieces.
The Art of <HI>Myron,</HI> and Imagery of <HI>Lysippus.</HI> Of <HI>Michael
Angelo</HI> and his three Perfections; <HI>Albert Durer, Vandick,</HI> so
famous in <HI>London,</HI> who attain'd to great Wealth by his Art; and
<HI>Paul Rubens,</HI> whose Table of the <HI>Last Judgment</HI> was valued
at five thousand <HI>Florins.</HI> Of <HI>Annealing</HI> or paint∣ing in
Glass, and <HI>Bulenger</HI>'s erroneous Opinion that it was known to the
Ancients, from a Distich in <HI>Martial.</HI> Of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Pictures stain'd in Linnen Cloth. Pictures woven in Cloth, as in Carpets and
Tapestry-Work, first taught by the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> according to
<HI>Pol. Virgil,</HI> and rival'd by the Arras-Workers in <HI>Flanders.</HI> Of
<HI>Mosaick</HI> Work, with co∣loured Stones, Metals, and Glass, in all
Figures, known to the Ancients according to <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Bulenger de
Pictura &amp; Statuaria.</HI> Lastly, of the Picture of <HI>Laoco</HI>
mentioned in <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> preserved in the Palace at
<HI>Rome,</HI> and ad∣mired by <HI>M. Angelo.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Of the Art of Spinning and Weaving, with the
seve∣ral Materials of Garments.</HI> After a Word or two on the In∣vention of
this Art ascribed to <HI>Minerva,</HI> we are inform'd of a rare
self-moving Engine at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> which would weave four or five Webs
at a time, and without human help work night and day; which, yet in favour of
the poor Weavers, was suppressed, and the Inventor secretly
destroy'd, according to <HI>Lancelotti.</HI> He next speaks of the
primitive Attire of Fig-leaves, and <HI>Paul</HI> the Hermit's Suit of
Palm-leaves; the Skins of Beasts; <HI>Arachne's</HI> Excellence in Spin∣ning;
the several sorts of Materials whereof Cloth is woven, as the
<HI>Nettle-Cloth,</HI> that of the <HI>Palm-leaves,</HI> of the Bark of the
<HI>Maguei</HI> among the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> which bears the <HI>Coco,</HI>
here describ'd from <HI>Du Bartas</HI>; and of the <HI>Pumpion</HI> brought
from <HI>Mecha,</HI> whereof <HI>Peireskius</HI> had a kind of Silk woven, as
<HI>Gassendus</HI> relates in his Life, besides which there is no
<HI>Se∣ricum Vegetabile,</HI> according to our Author; for that Silk properly
is made by and from the Silk-Worm, as <HI>Julius Scaliger</HI> against
<HI>Cardan</HI> shews; of which <HI>Pliny</HI> inserts many a moral
Lesson among his Observations. It is next ob∣served, that
<HI>Pamphilia</HI> first wove Silks; that the Emperor <HI>M. Aurel.
Antoninus</HI> first wore them in <HI>Europe</HI>; and that 
<PB N="49" REF="74"/> the Worm was first brought into this Quarter by certain
Monks in <HI>Justinian</HI>'s Time. That in the <HI>Summer-Islands</HI>
there are large beautiful-colour'd Spiders, which spin perfect raw Silk, as
<HI>Oviedo</HI> and Captain <HI>Smith</HI> relate. Of other Garments, made with
Hair, such as the Prophets wore: Grograms of Goat's Hair; whereof
<HI>Busbequius</HI> gives a more particular Account; and Chamlets of Camel's
Hair, as we may further read in <HI>Aelian.</HI> Of Flax and Hemp; that they
were first dress'd in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that the <HI>Egyptian</HI> and
<HI>Jewish</HI> Priests wore their Vestments thereof; also of Cotton
which grows in Balls on certain Shrubs. Next of the fine Linnen made in
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Cambray,</HI> whence called Hollands and Cambricks,
which <HI>Adrian Junius</HI> describes to be as white as snow, as fine as
Lawn, and as dear as Silk. Of the Sea-Wool, spoken of by <HI>Tertullian,</HI>
as fine as Silk according to <HI>La Cerda,</HI> which is made of the downy
Substance growing out of the large Shell-fish call'd <HI>Pinna.</HI> Also
a kind of Stone-Cloth made from certain Stones here named, which are beaten
into small Fibres or Hairs, and so woven; it is call'd by <HI>Langius,</HI>
Salamander's Wool, having the property of re∣sisting Fire. <HI>Ferdinand
Imperatus</HI> had of it in his <HI>Museum,</HI> and <HI>Callimachus</HI>
hung up a Taper of it in the Temple of <HI>Mi∣nerva,</HI> according to
<HI>Salmasius.</HI> But there is a Vegetable of the same property call'd by
the <HI>Greeks Asbastos,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Linum vivum</HI>
or incombustible Flax, and says the Car∣casses of Kings were wrapt in
it, when they were to be burn'd, to preserve their Ashes for the Urns.
<HI>Podocatter,</HI> who wrote <HI>de Rebus Cypriis</HI> in 1566, had of this
Cloth, which was seen by <HI>Tho. Porcacchius</HI> as he relates in his
<HI>Funeral Rites. Ludovicus Vives</HI> saw the like at <HI>Lovain,</HI> as
he also relates, and <HI>Baptista Porta,</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> as may be
read in his <HI>Nat. Magia.</HI> Mettals were also wrought into Cloth: such
were the <HI>Attalic</HI> Garments, call'd by the <HI>Italians, Veste di
Brocato di Oro</HI>; and when the marble Coffin of <HI>Mary,</HI> the Wife of
the Emperor <HI>Honorius,</HI> was dug up at <HI>Rome</HI> in 1544, tho' her
Body was consumed and turned to dust, all but her Teeth and Bones, her
golden Apparel was fresh; out of which, was extracted 36 Pound weight of pure
Gold, as <HI>Aldrovand</HI> records in his <HI>Musaeum Metallicum.</HI> The
<HI>Si∣donians</HI> had also such Vestments, as may be seen in
<HI>Virgil,</HI> Aen. xi. But the strangest of all, was that kind of Wool
mention'd by St. <HI>Hierom</HI> and <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> to have rained
down from the Clouds about <HI>Artois</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> whereof Cloth
was spun to the great Enrichment of the Country: <PB N="50" REF="75"/> So that
as there was once <HI>Coelum escatile,</HI> as <HI>Salvian</HI> speaks of
the wonderful <HI>Manna,</HI> in like manner there was now <HI>Coelum
textile,</HI> as we may term it; the Sky affording both Food and Rayment. To
this Chapter is join'd an <HI>Appendix</HI> of <HI>The Plumary Art.</HI> Here
it is observ'd to what Perfec∣tion this Art was arrived in <HI>Florida,</HI>
and other Parts of the <HI>West-Indies</HI>; where such Birds of
<HI>Orient</HI> Plumage abound, as the <HI>Phenicopter, Parrot,</HI> and
<HI>Tomincio</HI>: With the manner how they strip the Quills, and paste on
the Feathers in all Shapes and Shades. What delicate Works of this kind
<HI>Fer∣dinand Cortez,</HI> saw in the Emperor <HI>Motizuma</HI>'s Palace at
<HI>Mexico.</HI> That Cardinal <HI>Paleotti</HI> had the Picture of St.
<HI>Hie∣rom</HI> of this Workmanship; and that certain Fryers had learnt the
Art. That it was not unknown even to the Ancients. That St. <HI>Hierom</HI>
mentions it; also <HI>Julius Fermicus, Pruden∣tius,</HI> and <HI>Seneca.</HI>
That these Plumes surpass all the Beauties of the Pencil, not only in
Lustre but Duration, and foil the Art of Painting.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Of the Art of Musick, with the
Instruments,</HI> &amp;c. From the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Notion of Musick in
the Spheres, the Delight of Man's Soul in Harmony is here accounted for,
according to <HI>Macrobius</HI>; also from the Body of Man, which is a living
Organ, and Life itself, the Lesson which his Soul plays thereon. That
vocal Musick is most delight∣ful. That <HI>Pan</HI> devised the Imitation
of this musical Pipe in the Throat of Man, with a <HI>Syringe</HI> or Reed,
tho' <HI>Lucretius</HI> ascribes it to the whistling of the
<HI>Zephyrs</HI> in the Reeds. That in Imitation of them the Shank-bones of
Cranes were used, whence came the <HI>Flute:</HI> Not but musical
Instruments were in the World before <HI>Pan</HI>'s Time; <HI>Jubal</HI>
being the In∣ventor of the <HI>Harp</HI> and <HI>Organ.</HI> That the
<HI>Egyptian Mercury</HI> invented the Lyre or Lute, by a Tortoise-shell he
found on the <HI>Nile</HI>-side, to which some Nerves hung, reaching from
end to end, whereof <HI>Du Bartas</HI> has taken notice. That
<HI>Terpander</HI> encreased the Lyre from three Strings to seven,
<HI>Simonides</HI> added an eighth, and <HI>David</HI> mentions a
ten-string'd Instrument, who invented many sorts; but all are divided
into such as are founded either by the <HI>Breath</HI> or <HI>Hand.</HI>
Since his Time many have been the Improvements. <HI>Leander Al∣berti</HI> in
his Description of <HI>Italy</HI> relates that he saw a pair of Organs, in
which, Men would think they heard Boys and Men distinctly sing their Parts
in Concert; and another Pair in the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI>'s Court, made all
of <HI>Alabas∣ter,</HI> which gave a loud and full Sound; also another very
<PB N="51" REF="76"/> musical Pair at <HI>Venice,</HI> made all of Glass,
which are men∣tion'd by <HI>Moryson</HI> in his Travels. Pope
<HI>Sylvester</HI> the Se∣cond made a Pair that would play without any other
Organist than warm Water: Such <HI>Hydraulics,</HI> frequent in
<HI>Italy,</HI> are sounded also with cold Water. <HI>Gaudentius Merula, de
Mi∣rab. Mundi,</HI> mentions an Organ at <HI>Milan;</HI> the Pipes where∣of
were made of various Materials, as Wood, Brass, White∣lead, and imitated
various musical Instruments. Speaking next of vocal Musick, natural and
artificial, the Scarcity of good natural Singers is observ'd, occasioning
the Supply of musical Instruments for Delight, and to appease the Cares
of Life. Hence we are led to an <HI>Appendix, Of the Power and Efficacy of
Musick.</HI> The Commendations of <HI>Orpheus</HI> by <HI>Horace</HI> and
<HI>Claudian,</HI> and of <HI>Silenus</HI> by <HI>Virgil;</HI> with <HI>Tho.
Ran∣dolph</HI>'s Exhortation to Musick, finely illustrating the Force
thereof upon Rocks and Trees. Thus leaving things <HI>in∣animate,</HI> he
proceeds to Instances of the Regency of Mu∣sick over Creatures,
<HI>rational</HI> and <HI>irrational</HI>; among other Authorities he produces
that of <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> who says (in <HI>Pref. ad Herod.</HI>) that
he saw a Lion at <HI>London,</HI> which would forsake his Food to hear
Musick. The Delight which Deer and Elephants take therein; and that the Ass
only is not pleased with it. That Birds likewise are affected with
Mu∣sick, and Hawks tamed therewith. That it rules also in the Water, as in
the famous Story of <HI>Arion</HI> and the Dolphin; and was expected to prevail
over Hell itself, as in the at∣tempt made for the Recovery of
<HI>Eurydice,</HI> with a Compli∣ment to <HI>Spenser</HI> out of <HI>W.
Brown</HI>'s Pastorals, attesting that if <HI>Orpheus</HI> had been but
half his equal, he had not left her in those infernal Regions. Then for
rational Creatures, here are many Examples produced to shew, how Musick has
all our Passions at Command; how Courage and Fear have been raised by it;
how Anger has been stirr'd up, and al∣lay'd by it; how it exhilarates and
enlivens the Spirits, in∣spires Devotion, Chastity, and Civility; with an
Instance of the effect of <HI>Dactyls</HI> and <HI>Spondaics.</HI> That
Musick has also power over the Body, to keep it from drooping and
wea∣riness, and cure it of Maladies; of this latter we have many particulars,
as the Cure of the Plague in <HI>Homer</HI> by Musick; of the Frensy, by
<HI>Zenocrates;</HI> of the <HI>Sciatica,</HI> from the Ex∣perience of
<HI>Theophrastus;</HI> and some Aches, as reported in <HI>France:</HI> The
poisonous Bite of the <HI>Tarantula</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> that kind of
Frensy, call'd <HI>St. Vitus</HI> his Dance, in <HI>Germany,</HI> in which,
upon hearing of a Fiddle, the Patient dances till he is tired 
<PB N="52" REF="77"/> and cured; as <HI>Skenkius</HI> observes. Hence we
proceed to the Musick of Speech and Eloquence: Of the <HI>Grecian</HI>
Orators, who had the power of Fire and Water, to inflame and ex∣tinguish; to
make Peace and War. Then of some Moderns, as <HI>Savanorola,</HI> who managed
the Commonwealth with his Tongue, and <HI>Ugolin</HI> the Friar, who, by a
Sermon, moved his Audience to beat their Enemies. And if plain Speech has
such power, how much more must Words join'd with Harmony and Numbers? Here
we have a Summary of all the foremention'd Effects of Musick in some
Verses of <HI>Du Bartas;</HI> which is follow'd by <HI>Baptista
Porta</HI>'s nice Attempt to ascribe the wonderful Effects of Musick to the
Vertues of the several sorts of Trees, whereof the Instruments are made,
which, says he, have a secret Property to cure Dis∣eases more than the
Sounds that are made of them. But our Author thinks him mistaken, because
bare Words have power over Men's Minds and Spirits; so shews us, more
dis∣tinctly, from <HI>Scaliger,</HI> how the Vibration or trembling of the
Air, by Musick, affects the Spirits of Man. This is further strengthen'd by
the affinity between the Soul and Musick, observ'd by <HI>Aristotle</HI>
and <HI>Macrobius,</HI> and the Argu∣ment of its being no wonder that every
Creature, which has a living Soul, should be taken with Musick, since the
Soul of the Universe, whereof every particular Soul is a Part, is made of
<HI>Harmony.</HI> This Head is concluded with an Exam∣ple of the Force of
Eloquence in <HI>Pericles</HI> from <HI>Val. Maxi∣mus,</HI> and in the
Philosopher <HI>Hegesias,</HI> who so pathetically set forth the Evils
of Life, that his Auditors resolv'd to kill themselves, according to
<HI>Cicero.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>Of the Invention of Glass, and Glass-Works.</HI>
We are here inform'd of the Ingredients whereof Glass is made; by what
Accident it was invented, from <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Josephus;</HI> the
Properties of it, how fluid and ductile while hot, how hard, clean, and clear
when cold; how broken by Poisons, excessive Cold, or Heat. How Art in
forming of it imi∣tates the Creation, it being made with the Breath of the
Mouth. How preciously it is esteem'd of in some Coun∣tries, where it is
exchanged for Gold, according to <HI>Pigafetta.</HI> Where the best are made,
near <HI>Venice,</HI> and how. Tho' ours is so brittle, that an Artist at
<HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>Tiberius</HI> his Time, could make it malleable and
flexible, and that he was secretly made away, lest the Knowledge of his Art
should make Gold contemptible. Then we come to the Uses of Glass in Cups
and Vessels, Looking-Glasses, Telescopes, <PB N="53" REF="78"/>
Microscopes, Thermometers, Spheres, Spectacles, where∣by old Eyes become
young, small Objects are magnified, things invisible seen, and things
behind us brought before, and those done in our Neighbour's Houses, or
Enemy's Tents, brought to our Knowledge without the help of Ma∣gic; for which
we are referr'd to <HI>Baptista Porta.</HI> Then we advance more to
Particulars, as that <HI>Cornelius Van Drebble,</HI> that rare Engineer of
<HI>Alcmar,</HI> who liv'd here in K. <HI>James</HI>'s Court, invented the
Microscopes, whereby we discover the subtilest Objects, and the
smallest: And that <HI>Sanctorius,</HI> a famous Physician of
<HI>Padua,</HI> invented the Thermometers, which, in a Man's Chamber,
discover the Temper of the Air, whether hot or cold, moist or dry, or
inclining to ei∣ther. That Telescopes, for discovering things a-far off,
were invented by <HI>Jacobus Metius</HI> of <HI>Alcmar,</HI> as <HI>Des
Cartes</HI> tells us, and perfected by <HI>Gallileo Gallilei</HI> the
<HI>Florentine;</HI> which will represent Objects thirty times bigger than
the ap∣parent Quantity, and a hundred times nearer than the appa∣rent
Distance. By these, new Stars have been discover'd, and new Worlds in
them; the Moon brought down to Ex∣amination, and found to be another
<HI>America.</HI> By these <HI>Telesius</HI> has given us his
<HI>Selenographia,</HI> or Description of the Countries and Provinces there;
and <HI>Van Drebble</HI> saw not only the Hills and Plains, but the
Forests, Cities and Build∣ings in this Lunary World; as <HI>Gassendi</HI>
has written in his Life of <HI>Peiresk.</HI> And as for Burning-Glasses, we
have here the Account of the <HI>Roman</HI> Ships fired by <HI>Archimedes</HI>
at <HI>Sy∣racuse,</HI> from <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Life of <HI>Marcellus</HI>;
and those of <HI>Vi∣talianus</HI> fired by <HI>Proclus</HI> with such
Glasses; who thereby de∣fended <HI>Constantinople</HI> as
<HI>Zonaras</HI> records; and those where∣with our learned Countryman
<HI>Roger Bacon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Vir tam vastae doctrinae, ut <HI>Anglia</HI>

<BIBL><HI>Vossius</HI> de Artibus popular. Artis Magnae,
Lib. 10.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> offer'd the Pope to annoy the <HI>Turks</HI> more
than all the Galleys of <HI>Italy,</HI> or an Army of a Hundred Thousand Men
could do, as <HI>Gaffarel</HI> from others relates. <HI>Kircher</HI> indeed
could never hit upon the Experiment, or hear of Glasses that would burn
above fifteen Paces distance; but <HI>Baptista Porta</HI> declares there is
a way to make Glasses that would burn things at any distance, and Dr.
<HI>John Dee,</HI> in the Preface to his <HI>Monas Hieroglyphica,</HI> that it
may be made to calcine Stones and reduce them to powder. After this we come to
a Remark or two on the Spheres of <HI>Archimedes,</HI> which represented the
Motion of the <PB N="54" REF="79"/> heavenly Bodies, and is described by
<HI>Claudian</HI>; with the Dis∣tinction of <HI>Kircher,</HI> that the
outside only was of Glass; yet <HI>Peter Ramus</HI> speaks of two Glass
Spheres at <HI>Paris,</HI> like those of <HI>Archimedes.</HI> Next we have an
Observation on the Am∣phitheatre of Glass in <HI>Pliny,</HI> which was a
kind of Fossile, or <HI>Obsidian</HI> Glass found in
<HI>Aethiopia,</HI> black, transparent, and easily wrought; of which was
built the stately Tomb in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> by <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> for
<HI>Alexander,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> relates. <HI>Herodotus</HI> also tells
us this kind of Glass was wrought hol∣low, to case or enshrine dead
Bodies, that they might be seen. The specular Stone was of this kind but
brighter, and like Crystal: It was also used to shelter Fruits from
blighting Colds. But this kind of Stone is return'd by <HI>Pan∣cirollus, inter
non inventa. Leander</HI> mentions a compleat Galley of Glass at
<HI>Venice,</HI> and Glass Organs: <HI>James Howel</HI> saw such a Galley
at the <HI>Murano,</HI> as he writes in his <HI>History of</HI> Venice. As
Glass is diaphanous and passive to Objects, so it is also reflective,
and beats back the Objects which fall upon it, when the backside is lin'd
with Tinsoil, or Leaf of Tin-silver, or other Metal; and thus
Looking-Glasses are made, wherewith many strange Feats may be perform'd,
even to the Suspicion of Magic and unlawful Arts.</P>
<P N="10">X. <HI>The Invention of Shipping, Sailing, and the
Mariner's Compass.</HI> This Invention of riding on the blue Roads with
wooden Horses, as the old comic Poet phrases it, was highly bold as
<HI>Horace</HI> expresses it, and no less useful as all the World have
found it. The Motives to such Hazard are shewn from the Book of
<HI>Wisdom,</HI> to be Desire of Gain in Man, and a Willingness in God,
that the Works of his Wis∣dom should not lie idle. But we shall admire
such Boldness the more, in considering the Simplicity of Sailing in the
first Ages, when the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> made their Boats of Reeds and
Rushes, according to <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Lucan;</HI> such was that in
which <HI>Moses</HI> was preserv'd, such is spoken of in
<HI>Isaiah;</HI> also among the <HI>Indians,</HI> according to
<HI>Herodotus.</HI> The old <HI>Britains</HI> had their <HI>Naves Vitiles,</HI>
says <HI>Pliny</HI>; the <HI>Irish</HI> their <HI>Corraghes,</HI> being
made of Wicker cover'd with Leather, not much bigger than a Basket; such
<HI>Strabo</HI> says he sail'd to <HI>Egypt</HI> in; such were those
which <HI>Caesar</HI> learnt to make of the <HI>Britains;</HI> and such
were used by the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> as tes∣tifies <HI>Herodotus:</HI>
And they were so light that the Master could carry them on Shore, as they
carried him at Sea, like the <HI>Arabian</HI> Fisherman, whose
Tortoise-Shell was his Shal∣lop by Water, and his House by Land, as
<HI>Dubartas</HI> has it <PB N="55" REF="80"/> from a <HI>Latin</HI> Epigram.
Such like also, for lightness, the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> use on the
<HI>Nile,</HI> and <HI>Boterus</HI> mentions such again in the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> where they have also their <HI>Balsa's,</HI> or
Bulrushes rafted together, and row to fish in the main Sea upon them, as
may be read in <HI>Acosta.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> have likewise their
Canoes made out of one Tree hollowed, and in <HI>Greenland,</HI> Boats shaped
like a Shuttle, covered with Seal-Skins, and rib'd with Bones of Fishes, as
<HI>Purchas</HI> describes. <HI>Pet. Gellius</HI> in his Description of the
<HI>Thracian Bosphorus,</HI> speaks of a Ship he saw, laden with
<HI>A∣rabian</HI> Merchandize, which had no Iron in it, but was sewed
together with Cords, covered with Rosin of the Frank∣incence-Tree, and her
Tackling made of the Tree which bears the <HI>Indian</HI> Nut, which Mr.
<HI>Geo. Herbert</HI> describes. But the <HI>Tyrians</HI> are reputed the
first who improved Shipping with Masts, Sails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
<HI>Ovid</HI> tells us that <HI>Jason</HI> was the first Contriver of
Ships, and that his famous <HI>Argo</HI> was stelli∣fied by Astronomers.
The Shell-Fish called <HI>Nautilus,</HI> gave the first Hint of framing a
Ship, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> as the flying of the Kite did of the Stern;
afterwards they were magnificently made, as that Cedar Galley built by
<HI>Caligula,</HI> which had Halls, Rooms, and Gardens in it: and that of
<HI>Ptolemaeus Philopater,</HI> who built one two hundred eighty Cubits long,
fifty two Cubits from the Bottom to the upper Decks; had four hundred Banks for
four thousand Rowers, with Gardens and Orchards at top of it, as
<HI>Plutarch</HI> relates in his Life of <HI>Demetrius.</HI> But the
Improvement of Navi∣gation without Sails or Oars, so as never to be
wind-bound, was more commendable. We have the Account in <HI>Vitruvius</HI>
that for this end the Ancients had in their Ships three Wheels on each side,
with eight <HI>radii,</HI> a Span long, projecting from each Wheel, and six
Oxen within turning the same, which casting the Water backward, moved the
Ship on with great Speed. They had also an Instrument in those Ships,
called <HI>Carrum,</HI> dividing the Hours of the Day. Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> in
his <HI>Novum Organum,</HI> speaks of Boats in <HI>England</HI> to sail
under Water; and <HI>Julius Scaliger,</HI> of a Ship he could make that would
steer herself. This Chapter ends with the famous Re∣presentation of a
Naval Fight in <HI>Claudius Caesar</HI>'s time, men∣tioned by
<HI>Suetonius,</HI> and <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s Account of the Earthen Boats used
in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> So we proceed to the <HI>Appendix, of the Mariners
Compass,</HI> wherein we are inform'd that <HI>John Goia,</HI> or <HI>Flavius
Goia</HI> of <HI>Amalphi</HI> in <HI>Campania</HI> in the King∣dom of
<HI>Naples,</HI> first invented the Compass, who is therefore 
<PB N="56" REF="81"/> celebrated by <HI>Du Bartas.</HI> By what Stars Pilots
were di∣rected before the said Invention, and Travellers in the De∣serts of
<HI>Arabia,</HI> and how they were oblig'd to stop when the Sky was clouded,
therefore our Author says of the Loadstone, as <HI>Rablais</HI> of the
Milstone, that 'tis the most precious of all others. Then follows
<HI>Claudian</HI>'s Description of the <HI>Magnet,</HI> its two Properties of
<HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Direction,</HI> which gave Invention to the
Mariners Compass, whose Needle, touched therewith, points its Lilly-Hand to
the North, in any part of the World. The Inhabitants of <HI>Taprobana</HI>
having not the <HI>Pole-Star</HI> to sail by, carried certain Birds on board,
which being set at liberty, flew by natural Instinct to the Shore; so
gave direction to the Sailors, according to <HI>Pliny.</HI> The
<HI>Sy∣rians</HI> and the <HI>Bactrians,</HI> according to <HI>Curtius,</HI>
travelled by the Guidance of Stars; but the <HI>Arabians,</HI> says <HI>Lud.
Bartema,</HI> in certain Wooden Boxes on their Camels, have the Load∣stone
like the Compass, to steer their Course by over the Desarts. Some
ascribe this Invention to the <HI>Chinese</HI>; and Dr. <HI>Gilbert, de
Magnete, lib.</HI> 1. affirms that <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> brought it first
into <HI>Italy, An.</HI> 1260, having learnt it from them. <HI>Ludovicus
Vertomanus</HI> reports, that he saw about the Year 1500, the <HI>Indian</HI>
Pilot of his Ship, sailing in <HI>Java,</HI> steer by a Compass, made as
in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Head is con∣cluded with a Remark, that our Compass
is not yet brought to due Perfection, for that the <HI>Magnetic</HI> Needle
does not yet point exactly to the North in all Meridians, to the cause of
much Error in Navigation. <HI>Van Helmont</HI> professes a way to rectify
this Inconvenience, which, tho' somewhat fanciful, as appears by our Author's
Account of it, 'tis yet to be wish'd some Devices might be found to amend
that Imper∣fection.</P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>The Art of Cicuration and taming of wild
Beasts.</HI> It appears by the Introduction of this Chapter, that we have not
the same Title to this Book which our Author intended, and that he had call'd
it <HI>Historia Naturae Subactae</HI>; therefore thinks this Chapter no
Digression. He begins with a Quo∣tation from the New Testament,
shewing, that <HI>every kind of Beast is tamed by Mankind;</HI> gives
seveval Examples of the Elephant, and refers to many Stories of their
Officiousness and Docility in one of <HI>Lipsius</HI> his Epistles; and
of the Lion out of <HI>Pliny</HI>; that Tygers drew the Coach of
<HI>Bacchus,</HI> from <HI>Silius Italicus</HI>; and that of
<HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> as <HI>Lampridius</HI> re∣lates. <HI>Martial</HI>
mentions the same in <HI>Domitian</HI>'s time; that the fierce
<HI>Byson,</HI> and Stag were taught to do the same; and 
<PB N="57" REF="82"/> at <HI>Walton</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> our Author saw
four Stags draw a small Coach. <HI>Lipsius</HI> in his Notes upon
<HI>Tacitus,</HI> speaks of Dogs drawing a Chariot at <HI>Rome</HI>; and
<HI>Textor,</HI> of Os∣triches that drew the Coach of the Emperor
<HI>Firmus.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the second, had a Deer which
would receive a Bridle and a Rider, and run against the fleetest Horse,
as <HI>Mich. Neander</HI> relates. <HI>Martial</HI> mentions also a Deer
used to a Bridle, and <HI>Camden</HI> in his Annals of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
that Sir <HI>Hierom Bowes</HI> brought from <HI>Muscovia</HI> certain
<HI>Does</HI> of admirable Swiftness, which being yoked and coupled in a
Coach, would carry a Man with great Speed. Next we have an Account of tame
Panthers, Leopards, and Lions to hunt with, as the King of <HI>Cambala</HI>'s,
which <HI>Aelian</HI> mentions, and <HI>Scaliger</HI>; and Mr.
<HI>Moryson</HI> speaks of Leopards so tame, that they would leap up
behind the Huntsman on his Horse, and sit like a Dog, and soon
dispatch a Hart, which shews the Excellence of Man's Abilities to subdue
other Creatures; but as <HI>Xenophon</HI> observes, it is far easier taming
any Creature than Man; and <HI>Seneca</HI> has a Reflection to the same
purpose, that no Creature is so wayward, fierce, and untractable as Man. We
have next an Account from <HI>Strabo,</HI> of a Crocodile that had been tamed,
and Dragons mentioned by <HI>Seneca</HI> to have crept tamely upon Men's
Tables, among their Cups; and of a four-legged Serpent in <HI>Cairo,</HI> grown
familiar and harmless. Many Instances of Birds; as, Ostriches drawing a
Coach; Eagles enured to fly at Fowl like Hawks; a Crow taught to fly at
Partridges, and Wild-Ducks made Decoys. Of Sea-Animals; the <HI>Mannti,</HI> or
Sea-Cow is instanced, from <HI>Peter Martyr</HI>; the Sea-Horse, from
<HI>Leo Afer</HI>; and the Fish called <HI>Reversus,</HI> by which the
<HI>Indians</HI> caught others, as is related by <HI>Bodin,</HI> in his
<HI>Theatrum Naturae,</HI> also by <HI>Purchas</HI> and <HI>P. Martyr.
Pliny</HI>'s Dolphins, which would suffer Correction like Setting-Dogs, as
<HI>Oppian</HI> also testifies, and of Otters taught to drive Fish into
the Net, according to <HI>Cardan.</HI> Also several Examples of Wild
Beasts tamed for Sport and Pleasure, as well as Service; such were the
Dancing Camels which <HI>Leo</HI> saw, and the Elephants which danced on the
Ropes, in <HI>Seneca,</HI> with the manner of teaching them upon a hot Floor,
from <HI>Sandys</HI> in his Travels. The Elephant <HI>Busbequius</HI> saw at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> which danced and play'd at Ball. The Bear which
danced to the Musick of his own Tabor, and then begg'd for Reward, seen by
<HI>Neander.</HI> The Dance of Horses at the Marriage of the Duke of
<HI>Florence,</HI> attested by Sir <HI>K. Digby</HI>; and the Ass seen by
<HI>Leo</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> which would <PB N="58" REF="83"/> vie Feats
with <HI>Banks</HI> his Horse, that rare Master of the
<HI>Ca∣ballistic</HI> Art. Here we have a Story of the dangerous Effects of
such Dancing Horses among the <HI>Sabarites,</HI> when their Enemies the
<HI>Crotonians</HI> brought Musick into the Field of Battle, from
<HI>Diodorus Siculus, Aelian,</HI> and <HI>Pliny.</HI> To shew that a Baboon
has play'd upon the Guittar, and a Monky at Chess, we are referr'd to
<HI>Balt. Castilione.</HI> Of Birds, are mentioned the Talking Starlings,
Pyes and Crows at <HI>Rome</HI>; Cardinal <HI>Ascanio</HI>'s Parrot would
say the <HI>Creed,</HI> and another in <HI>Spain</HI> which would sing the
<HI>Gamut,</HI> as <HI>John Barnes</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Frier relates, in
his learned Book <HI>de Aequivocatione.</HI> Many of these Examples are
sum'd up by <HI>Martial</HI> in his Book of <HI>Shows, Epig.</HI> 105 which
is here recited, with a Transla∣tion. Lastly, it is observed how Animals
will learn the Language of their Country, so far as is necessary for
their Direction, as Elephants, Horses, and Mules, which <HI>Claudian</HI> has
taken notice of; and that Dogs have been trained for the Wars by the old
<HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Gauls,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Camden</HI>
relate; so have Bulls, Bears, and Lions, according to <HI>Lucre∣tius,</HI>
here cited. This, with some other Citations from <HI>Grotius, Plutarch,</HI>
and <HI>Origen,</HI> shewing that the Wit and Reason of Man reduces all
other Creatures to his Service and Subjection, concludes this Chapter.</P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>Of certain Sports and Extravagancies of Art.</HI>
In this last Chapter of the Book, it is set forth, that as Nature has her
<HI>Ludicra,</HI> so has Art; and that Art as well as Nature is never more
wonderful than in smaller Works: That St. <HI>Augustine</HI> admired as
much at the Tooth of a Moth as that of an Elephant. So we descend to
Particulars, as the Ivory Ants of <HI>Callicrates</HI>; the little Ivory
Chariot, Horses and Dri∣ver of <HI>Myrmecides,</HI> to be cover'd with the
Wings of a Fly; and the Ship with all her Tackling, which a Bee could hide,
according to <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Aelian.</HI> Next are <HI>Vulcan</HI>'s
Nets, mentioned out of <HI>Ovid.</HI> The Waggon and Oxen of Glass, which
might be concealed by a Fly, in <HI>Cardan</HI>; and the neat little Wooden
Lock, mentioned by <HI>Leander Alberti</HI>; which introduces the rare
Workmanship of <HI>Mark Scaliot</HI> a Blacksmith of <HI>London,</HI> in
his Iron Lock and Key and Gold Chain of forty three Links, all drawn by a Flea,
and all, with the Flea, weighing but one Grain and a half; as witnesses
<HI>John Stow</HI> in his <HI>Annals,</HI> who saw it. <HI>Scaliger</HI>
also men∣tions a Flea with a Gold Chain, and <HI>Leo Afer</HI> such a
Chain, for which the Artist had a Suit of Cloth of Gold bestowed upon him
by the <HI>Sultan. Hadr. Junius</HI> saw at <HI>Mechlin,</HI> a 
<PB N="59" REF="84"/> Basket made of a Cherry-Stone, which held fourteen pair of
Dice, whose Spots were visible. Then we have notice taken of the precious
Stone in a Ring, representing <HI>Phaeton,</HI> his Chariot and Steeds,
tumbling into the River, as men∣tion'd in <HI>Galen</HI>; and <HI>Geo.
Whitehead</HI>'s Ship, with all her Tackling, moving of itself on a Table,
with Rowers, a Wo∣man playing on the Lute, a Whelp howling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as
affirmed by <HI>Schottus,</HI> in <HI>Itin. Italiae</HI>; also,
<HI>Gafferell</HI>'s Account, in his <HI>Unheard of Curiosities,</HI> of the
Clock at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> which had on it a Company of Shepherds playing on
the Bagpipes, with others dancing by Couples thereto, in Time and Measure.
Here is also mentioned the Chain, in <HI>Cardan,</HI> so little and so
light, that when it fell to the Ground, it would not break, tho' made of
Glass; and the Iron Spider in <HI>Walchius</HI>'s ninth Fable; to which our
Author applies the Verses in <HI>Dubartas,</HI> celebrating the Iron Fly of
<HI>Regiomontanus</HI>; also the Bear and Lion of Gold (presented to the
<HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>Hesse</HI>) each a Middle-Finger's Length, and
both weighing but a <HI>French</HI> Crown, for which the Artist was rewarded
with three thou∣sand Crowns. This is followed with <HI>Claudian</HI>'s
Epigram <HI>de Quadriga Marmorea,</HI> and the Translation; and the whole
Book concludes with a Reference to many more Instances of the like nature, in
<HI>John Tradescant</HI>'s Ark at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and the Archives of
several Princes and private Persons, who have their <HI>Pinacotheca</HI>'s
and <HI>Technematophylacia</HI> to preserve all Rarities; more particularly
that of <HI>Bernard Paludanus</HI> a Physician in <HI>Holland,</HI> upon
which here is an Epigram quoted, and Information of another among
<HI>Grotius</HI>'s Poems to the same purpose.</P>

<P>THis <HI>English Theological Library</HI> may well recommend
itself to the Notice of the <HI>British Librarian,</HI> seeing the
Author, who was Historiographer to the Elector of <HI>Bran∣denburg,</HI> 
<PB N="60" REF="85"/> has so sincerely intended therein the Honour of the
<HI>British</HI> Nation, and has common-placed, so succinctly and, for
the generality, so methodically, above <HI>sixteen Hundred Writers of
Divinity</HI> in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> un∣der
some of the most considerable Heads. But being writ∣ten in <HI>Latin</HI>
and printed abroad, at <HI>Koningsberg</HI> in <HI>Prussia,</HI> it seems
not to have yet made sufficiently its way among some of our Readers, to
whom it might have been useful in several respects; and possibly
that, among the rest, of in∣spiring an Ambition to give us a more enlarged
and perfect Plan upon this Subject: For, strictly speaking, tho' such a
spiritual Army, of all ranks; is here muster'd up, many who were eminent
among us are omitted, and several enlisted who little deserve such
Distinction; some also, who were Writers in different Sciences, are not
very properly perhaps introduced here; and, of most, we have only the bare
Names, with the shortest Reference to those Parts of their Works, which
concern the respective Topics, under which they are assembled. But the
Author's Aim was Variety and Dispatch; and rather to bring a great number of
Writers into a little Compass, than either to appear severely scrupu∣lous
in his Choice, and always distinctly acquainted with their Characters, or to
make his Readers constantly so with the Editions of their Works. The Book
will however be very serviceable to any Reader or Writer upon the Subjects
herein treated of. It will yield Matter of Recollection to those who are even
most conversant in our Theological Au∣thors, and to those who are most
inquisitive after them, continual Directions for further Satisfaction. The
Author neglected no Advantages to render it thus far useful; he seems to
have consulted our Catalogues very diligently, which specify those
<HI>English</HI> Authors who have written upon the several Parts of
Scripture, and other Points of Divinity; and further, for his purpose, to
have made good Use of his Time while he was in the Library at
<HI>Oxford,</HI> among several of the Books themselves which they refer to,
as also of the Conversation he had with Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> and other
learned Men in <HI>England,</HI> particularly Dr. <HI>Thomas Barlow,</HI>
afterwards Bi∣shop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> who was himself an
<HI>Ecclesiastical Library.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Method and Contents more particularly of this Work;
after the Author's Dedication to the <HI>Elector</HI> afore∣said, and a
learned Epistle to the Reader, he opens it with a copious Preface, concerning
the different Versions and E∣ditions of the Bible in <HI>England,</HI> with
notice of those among <PB N="61" REF="86"/> us who have written any
Discourses thereon, or Books to explain it, as Annotations, Lexicons,
Criticisms, Chrono∣logies, Chorographies, and the like. Then he begins his
<HI>first</HI> Book with the <HI>English</HI> Commentators on the <HI>Old
Testa∣ment;</HI> goes distinctly through all the Parts or <HI>Books</HI>
thereof, and through all the <HI>Chapters</HI> of every Book; and therein tells
us, what <HI>English</HI> Author has written upon any of the said Books,
Chapters, or Verses in them. The like he does in his <HI>second</HI> Book
by all the <HI>English</HI> Commentaries, Ob∣servations, and Sermons on the
<HI>New Testament;</HI> comprising a Book in every Chapter, and the Writers
on each Chap∣ter in a Paragraph. Thus having got over near half the Volume we
come to the last Book, which is divided into <HI>Twenty-one</HI> Chapters;
the first <HI>Six</HI> of which, comprehend chiefly his <HI>Systema
Theologiae Positivae,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Au∣thors treating of
the several Branches therein; which, for brevity, we shall refer to. Then
we come, in the <HI>Seventh,</HI> to those <HI>Englishmen</HI> who have
written of the <HI>Church</HI> and its Government, Ordination,
Representatives, Revenues, Po∣lity, Schisms, Ceremonies, Festivals,
Sabbath, Musick, and oeconomic State; particularly, Matrimony, Polygamy, and
Education. The 8th is of the Writers on the four last Things. 9. Those who
have wrote of Polemical Divinity. 10. Against Atheists, Jews, Turks, and
Infidels. 11. A∣gainst Popery. 12. Against the Socinians, Anabaptists,
&amp;c. 13. Against Enthusiasts, Libertines, Antinomians, and Ar∣minians.
14. Against the <HI>English</HI> Sectaries, Puritans, Se∣paratists,
Brownists, Independents, Fanaticks, Presbyterians, &amp;c. 15. Against the
Quakers. 16. On School-Divinity. 17. On Practical Divinity. 18. On
Casuistical Divinity. 19. Of the improved Editions of the Fathers in
<HI>England.</HI> 20. Of our Politico-Ecclesiastical Historians. And
lastly, 21, of the <HI>English</HI> Councils.</P>
<P>Then follows the <HI>Appendix,</HI> containing an epistolary
Dis∣course upon the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> written in his native Tongue;
no Author having publish'd, in <HI>Germany,</HI> any thing upon the
Institution, Progress, and Purpose of that laudable Or∣der: With a List
of the <HI>Fellows</HI> of the said <HI>Society</HI>; and Verses at the
end.</P>

ENG∣LISH STAGE; <HI>shewing the ancient Use, Improvement, and Perfection
of</HI> DRAMATIC <HI>Representations in this Nation. In a Dialogue of</HI>
PLAYS <HI>and</HI> PLAYERS. 8vo. 1699. pages 32.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>WHen this Pamphlet was publish'd, there was a Controversy on
foot about the Stage; and while others wrote to shew what it then
<HI>was,</HI> our Author, as a Topic not touch'd upon, ob∣serves what it
<HI>had been.</HI> He apologizes to those who may ima∣gine his Subject
trivial, by producing a Player, who was a Saint; and referring to Examples of
Merit in the Discourse itself: 
<Q REND="inline">"If the <HI>major</HI> Part of them (as he
concludes his Preface) fall un∣der a different Character, it is the general
Unhappiness of Mankind, that the <HI>most</HI> are the
<HI>worst.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Dialogue</HI> is held between <HI>Lovewit</HI> and
<HI>Truman</HI> an old <HI>Ca∣valier,</HI> who knew the Stage in the Reign of
K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. From these we learn, how much the Actors before the
Civil Wars sur∣passed their Successors: Why they did not now revive
<HI>Ben John∣son</HI>'s Plays. Where, before the Wars, the Town supported
<HI>five</HI> Play-houses at once; and in which of them they always acted by
Day-light: That now the Plays in <HI>two</HI> Houses only, would hardly draw
an Audience, without a Signior <HI>Fideli</HI> or a Monsieur <HI>L'Abbe.</HI>
That <HI>Edward Allen</HI> built a Play-house, also <HI>Dulwich</HI>
College in 1619. Then we have a little History of the Actors during the
Rebellion; shewing how honourably they served in the King's Army. Next, how
they return'd to acting, but pri∣vately; and, in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Time, at
<HI>Holland-House.</HI> How the Companies reviv'd after the Restoration.
Where <HI>Scenes</HI> were in∣troduced by Sir <HI>W. Davenant.</HI> When Women
first acted. A Character of Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Book against the Stage.
That our ancient Plays were of religious Subjects, in many Examples from
<HI>Stow,</HI> Sir <HI>W. Dugdale, Fitz-Stephens,</HI> Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> the
Play of the <HI>Pardoner</HI> and <HI>Frene,</HI> &amp;c. When Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> first had Players, and of Noblemen's Companies. The
first Comedy that looks like regular. Sir <HI>George Buck</HI>'s Encomium on
acting of Plays in his Time. When Theatres were first erected in
<HI>London.</HI> Of the Prohibition of Plays from <HI>Hollinshed</HI>; and
Statutes for their Regulation, 39 <HI>Eliz.</HI> cap. 4. and 3 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1.
cap. 21. The two <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the Long Parliament, <HI>Octob.</HI>
22, 1647. and <HI>Feb.</HI> 11. the same Year, to suppress them. That
Cock-fighting was also prohibited by one of <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Acts,
<HI>March</HI> 31, 1654. But the <HI>Old Cavalier</HI> not allowing these as
<HI>Laws,</HI> takes leave of his Correspondent, and so concludes the

<HI>&amp;c. Enprynted by</HI> <HI REND="blackletterType">William Caxton</HI>
<HI>at</HI> Westmestre. Folio, 1477. 75 Leaves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This
is a Title gather'd from what the <HI>Translator</HI> mentions in his
Preface, and the <HI>Printer,</HI> in his Conclusion of the Book; for the Art
of Printing had not yet arrived at the Distinction of <HI>Title-pages</HI> in
Form. Further, we may remark of this antique <HI>Specimen</HI> of that, then,
new Art in <HI>England,</HI> that if it is not our first Book printed here,
it may be the second, tho' printed so late in the Year above-mention'd as
<HI>November</HI>; and tho' some other smaller Work might be printed by
<HI>Caxton</HI> the same Year. For tho' the Knowledge of two, printed before
it, by him, is descended to us; yet one is expressly said to be printed
abroad, and the other has no place mention'd where it was printed. Dr.
<HI>Conyers Middleton</HI> observes, 
<Q REND="inline">"It has been generally asserted and
believ'd, that all <HI>Caxton</HI>'s Books were printed in the Ab∣bey of
<HI>Westminster</HI>; yet we have no Assurance of it from him∣self, nor
any mention of the place before 1477."</Q> Which Ob∣servation is plainly
drawn from the Date of this Book, and it appears thereby to be the first, at
least now in being, which was printed at <HI>Westminster</HI>; 
<Q REND="inline">"So that he had been printing several Years
without telling us where."</Q> See the said Doctor's <HI>Ori∣gin of Printing
in England,</HI> 4<HI>to. Cambr.</HI> 1735. <HI>p.</HI> 20. We are in∣form'd
there is in being a fair MS of this Translation, and, what some may think
yet a greater Curiosity, an Illumination in it, representing King
<HI>Edward</HI> IV. his Queen, and the Prince, with the Picture also of this
<HI>Antony Wydeville</HI> Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> presenting <HI>Caxton</HI> to
the King. But more particularly of the printed Book, we observe, it is
perform'd on a good thick Paper, in which may be discern'd its Maker's Mark
to be somewhat like a Pair of Horns, with a Flower over them. The Pages have
no Num∣bers at top, nor Signatures, or Catch-words at bottom; these be∣ing
more modern Improvements in Printing, at least in <HI>England.</HI> The
Division of the Chapters is seldom by any larger Space than the other
lines; only the three first lines of every Chapter being shorter than the
rest, leave room, towards the Margin, for the <HI>initial</HI> Letter, which
is always a small one; and the second Let∣ter of the Word which begins
every Chapter, is always a Capi∣tal. As to <HI>Orthography,</HI> the same
Words are not always spell'd alike, and several of the Proper Names are
much obscur'd by the old Manner of spelling them, especially after the
<HI>French</HI> Copy: and as to <HI>Pointing,</HI> there are but two sorts of
Stops used; the one, a little Dash, the other, a little Cross; and
seldom either used as a Period at the End of a complete Sentence, it being
thought sufficient Distinction to allow a little longer Space there than
be∣tween other Words, and to begin the next Sentence with a Capi∣tal. More
Observations might hence be made on the Rudiments of Printing in
<HI>England</HI>; but to those who are not curious after such Inquiries,
possibly the greater Number, these may be e∣nough. Of the noble Earl
<HI>Rivers,</HI> who translated this Book, much might be written: therefore
we shall only observe here, that he publish'd one or more Books after
this, and refer those who would know more of him to the Chronicles, and
especially to <HI>Dugdale's Baronage</HI>; where it may appear what a Man of
su∣perior. Merit and Dignity he was among many eminent of his Name; also
how he was barbarously put to death in <HI>June</HI> 1483, at
<HI>Pontefract</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> by the Procurement of
<HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> then Protector, being aged
about 41 Years, as we compute from the Account of his Age at the Death of his
Mo∣ther <HI>Jacquett</HI> Dutchess of <HI>Bedford</HI> in 1472, as it
stands upon Re∣cord in the <HI>Escheats.</HI></NOTE>.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE first Page of this Book begins with the Earl's Preface or
Introduction. Herein he observes, that every hu∣man Creature is subject to
the Storms of Fortune, and per∣plex'd <PB N="64" REF="89"/> with worldly
Adversity, of which he had largely had his Part; but having been reliev'd by
the Goodness of God, he was exhorted to dispose his recover'd Life to his
Service. And understanding there was to be a Jubilee and Pardon at <HI>St.
James's</HI> in <HI>Spain, an.</HI> 1473. he determin'd upon a Voyage thither:
so in <HI>July</HI> the same Year, set sail from <HI>Southampton</HI>;
when, a worshipful Gentleman in his Company, named <HI>Lowys de
Bretaylles,</HI> lent him to pass over the Time, this Book of the <HI>Sayings
of the Philosophers,</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> which had been translated
from the <HI>Latin</HI> by Messire <HI>Johan de Teonville,</HI> Provost
of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Earl was very much af∣fected with the wholesome and
sweet Sayings therein of the <HI>Paynems</HI>; and finding how 
<Q REND="inline">"it speaketh universally to the Example, Weel,
and Doctryne of alle Kynges, Prynces, and to People of every Estate; lawdes
Vertu and Science, blames Vices and Ignorance;"</Q> tho' he could not then, nor
in all that Pilgrimage, oversee it well at his Pleasure, thro' 
<PB N="65" REF="90"/> the Dispositions that belong to the Taker of a Jubilee
and Pardon, and the great Acquaintance he found there of wor∣shipful Folks,
he intended at a more convenient Time to be better acquainted with it.
Remaining in this Opinion after the King commanded him to attend upon the
Prince, and having then leisure, he translated it into <HI>English,</HI>
which had not been before done: But as there were divers Copies of this Book,
differing from each other, he concludes with intimating his hopes, that he
shall not be censured for that which he has follow'd; or his Translation
judg'd of by those which vary from it.</P>
<P>The Work itself opens with the Sayings of <HI>Sedechias;</HI>
so goes on with those of many eminent Ancients, as <HI>Homer, Solon,
Hyppocrates, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Alexander,
Ptolemy, Seneca,</HI> St. <HI>Gregory, Galen,</HI> and some few others; all
whom have a Chapter a-piece be∣stow'd upon their Sayings. But the concluding
Chapter comprehends the Sayings of several Persons; first, of those
whose Names are remember'd, and lastly, such as are <HI>ano∣nymous;</HI>
from which, as the <HI>Apopthegms</HI> of most of those Ancients are now
more directly translated from the origi∣nal Languages, in which they were
deliver'd, we shall only give this one Example.. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ther cam byfore a Kyng thre Wysemen; the one
was a <HI>Greke,</HI> the other a <HI>Jewe,</HI> and the therde a
<HI>Sarasyn;</HI> of whom the sayd Kyng desirid, that ych of them wold
utter som good and notable Sen∣tence. Then the <HI>Greke</HI> sayd, I may
wele correcte and amende my <HI>Thoughtis,</HI> but not my <HI>Wordes:</HI>
Then the <HI>Jewe</HI> sayd, I have mervayll of them that <HI>saye</HI>
thinges <HI>prejudicial,</HI> where <HI>Silence</HI> were more
<HI>prouffitable:</HI> And the <HI>Sarasyn</HI> sayd, I am
<HI>Mayster</HI> over my Wordes, or it be pronounced; but when it is
spoken, I am <HI>Servaunt</HI> there∣to. And it was asked one of them; Who
might be called a <HI>Kyng?</HI> And he answerd, He that is not
<HI>subgett</HI> to his owne Will.</Q></P>
<P>At the end of the Translation of this Work, there is a
remarkable Chapter added of three Leaves (which concludes the whole Volume) by
<HI>William Caxton,</HI> or in his Name: For, as it contains a Translation
from the <HI>French,</HI> of those Sarcasms of <HI>Socrates,</HI> against
the female Sex, which our no∣ble Translator of the rest, had purposely
pass'd over, in the proper Place, under the Chapter of that Philosopher;
the Reader is left to judge, if the said Earl seriously intended to 
<PB N="66" REF="91"/> favour the Fair, by such an Omission, in the middle
of his Book, whether his Printer would probably make so free as to publish
it, of his own accord, tho' in his own Name, more conspicuously at the end
of it. If it is a piece of <HI>Fi∣nesse,</HI> it is artfully enough
conducted, to expose them more notoriously, under the Notion of forbearing
to do it at all. We never read that the Case has been so interpreted, nor
can say, in what Vein or Air Maister <HI>Caxton</HI>'s Apology for the
said Addition was written, or is to be read; but there are in it the
following Expressions. 
<Q REND="inline">"I <HI>fynde</HI> that my saide Lord hath left
out certayn and dyverce Conclusions towchyng <HI>Women!</HI> wherein I
mervaylle that my sayd Lord hath not wreton them, ne what hath mevyd him so
to do, ne what cause he hadde at that Tyme: But I sup∣pose that some
<HI>fayr</HI> Lady hath desired hym to leve it out of his Booke; or ellys he
was amerous on somme <HI>noble</HI> Lady, for whos Love he wold not sette
it in his Book; or ellys for the very Affectyon, Love and good Wylle that he
hath unto <HI>alle Ladyes</HI> and Gentylwomen, he thought that
<HI>Socrates</HI> spared the Sothe, and wrote of Women more than Trouthe. For
if he had made fawte in wryting of Women, he ought not, ne shold not be
belevyd in his other Dyctes and Sayinges. But I apperceyve that my sayd Lord
knoweth veryly, that suche Defautes ben not had ne founden in the Women born
and dwellyng in <HI>these Partyes,</HI> ne Regyons of the World.
<HI>Socrates</HI> was a <HI>Greke,</HI> boren in a ferre Contre from
<HI>hens,</HI> whyche Contre is alle of othre Condycions than <HI>this</HI> is;
and Men and Women of other Nature than they ben here in <HI>this Contre;</HI>

evydent, my sayd Lord, as I suppose, thoughte it was not of

<HI>So∣crates</HI> touchyng Women. But for as moche as I had commandement of my
sayd Lord to correcte and amende whereas I sholde fynde fawte; and other
fynde I none, sauf that he hath left out these Dictes and Saynges of the
Women of <HI>Grece</HI>; therefore in accomplishing his Com∣mandement, for as

Copye or not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My Lord's Words are, under the Chapter of

peradven∣ture that the Wynde had blowe over the Leef, at the tyme of

<P>The Translator, in his <HI>Preface</HI> to the first Volume,
having spoken much in Commendation of <HI>History,</HI> and having a∣mong
the rest diligently read the four Volumes of Sir <HI>John Froissart,</HI>
he judg'd them necessary and proper to be ren∣der'd into
<HI>English,</HI> since they treat of <HI>the famous Acts done in our
Parts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and specially redound to the Honour of</HI>
Englishmen; which Chronicle begins at the Reign of K. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III.
and continues to the beginning of K. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. containing the Space of
threescore and fourteen Years, that is from 1326 to 1400. He then bespeaks
the favourable Reception of his Labour as to his not following his Author word
for word, since he trusts that he has kept to the true Sentence (or
Sense) of the Matter, and for naming all Per∣sons, Countries, Cities,
Towns, Rivers, or Fields, as he found them in <HI>French.</HI> And tho' he has
not given every Lord, Knight, or 'Squire his true Addition, yet trusts he 
<PB N="69" REF="94"/> has not swerved from the true Sentence of the Matter.
And where he has named the Distance between Places, by Miles and Leagues,
they must be understood according to the Custom of the Countries where
they are named, being in some Places longer than in others. This is the
Sense of his said Preface; after which follows</P>
<P>The <HI>Prologue</HI> of Sir <HI>John Froissart</HI>; which is
the first Chapter. Herein we are inform'd, That he proposes to take his
Foundation out of the true Chronicles, compiled by that Right Reverend,
discreet and sage Master <HI>John le Bel,</HI> sometime Canon in St.
<HI>Lambert</HI>'s of <HI>Liege,</HI> who with great Diligence, Charge and
Cost, through the Encourage∣ment and Intelligence he received from Sir
<HI>John</HI> of <HI>Hay∣nault,</HI> continued it all his Days. Further, That
our Au∣thor <HI>Froissart</HI> always inclining to these Studies,
frequented the Company of divers Noble and Great Lords, as well in <HI>France,
England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> as other Countries, and had Knowledge from
them of the Adventures that befel, espe∣cially since the great Battle of
<HI>Poitiers,</HI> where King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was taken
Prisoner, before which time he was but young: Yet took upon him as soon as
he came from School, to write and recite the said Book, and bare the same
com∣piled into <HI>England,</HI> and presented the Volume to
<HI>Philippa</HI> of <HI>Haynault,</HI> the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> who
received it to his great Profit and Advancement. But because the same Book
might not be sufficiently correct, he enterprised this Hi∣story on the
aforesaid Ordynance and true Foundation, at the Instance and Request of a
dear Lord of his, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Namure,</HI> Knight, Lord of
<HI>Beaufort.</HI> And this is the Substance at his <HI>Prologue</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Further of this Author, Sir JOHN FROISSART, and his CHRONICLE,
we have taken the pains to give our Reader the following more perfect Account,
chiefly from his own Words, than has hitherto been drawn together by any other
Writer.</P> 
<P>He was born at <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> as himself tells us,
Vol. II. (of this Edition) fol. 29. and in the Year 1337, as we gather also
from his own Words. For he came first over into <HI>England</HI> when
<HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and his Princess were going to their
Government of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> Vol. II. fol. 319. b. Which by his own Account
(in the <HI>French</HI> Copies) was in 1361 (but accord∣ing to our
<HI>English</HI> Translation, Vol. II. fol. 305. the Year fol∣lowing) being
then aged 24 Years. The Interest thro' which he came recommended to the
<HI>English</HI> Court, and his laudable Undertaking to enlarge and continue
<HI>John le Bel</HI>'s History, chiefly, of the <HI>English</HI>
Conquests in <HI>France,</HI> soon brought him into familiar Conversation
with Persons of the greatest Distinc∣tion. He was made one of the Clerks
of the Chamber to Queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> Wife of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. as
he tells us himself; was afterwards knighted; and, being an Ecclesiastic,
well be∣neficed in the Church. After he had been here about five Years, in
which Time he had travell'd almost all over <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was well
known in King <HI>David</HI>'s Court, Vol. II. fol. 158, 161. b. we meet with
him at <HI>Burdeaux,</HI> when the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Son, afterwards
King <HI>Richard</HI> II. was born there, <HI>Anno</HI> 1366. He intended to
have waited on the Prince in his Expedition to <HI>Spain,</HI> but was sent
back by him to continue his Attendance on the Queen his Mother, Vol. II. Cap.
200. He seems to have staid not above two Years in <HI>England,</HI> before
he left this Kingdom for a long Time, being absent about <HI>Twenty Eight
Years.</HI> In which space he probably obtained his Ecclesiastical
Preferments abroad, being Canon and Treasurer of <HI>Chimay</HI> in
<HI>Heynault,</HI> and of <HI>Lisle</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> also
Chaplain to <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Castellon,</HI> Earl of <HI>Blois,</HI> as he
mentions, Vol. II. fol 242. And Rector of <HI>Le∣scines</HI> on the Mount,
near <HI>Mons</HI> in <HI>Heynault,</HI> according to <HI>Le Laboureur's
Introd. a L'Hist. de Cha.</HI> VI. p. 69. In all this Time he continu'd his
<HI>Chronicle,</HI> from the Reports of the most credible and intelligent
Persons, he met with in every Prince's Court to which he remov'd, and he
seems to have given Copies of the several Parts as he finish'd them, to
his Patrons; for many Quires thereof finely illuminated, were in the Custody
of <HI>Louis</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> in 1381, intended by the Author to be
sent to the King of <HI>England. Le Laboureur Hist. de Cha.</HI> VI. <HI>en
la Vie de Louis Duc d' Anjou.</HI> But our Author admires none of those
Courts, so much as that of <HI>Gaston</HI> Earl of <HI>Foix,</HI> at
<HI>Ortaise</HI> in <HI>Bearn,</HI> which was the grandest Market in
<HI>Europe</HI> for Tydings or News, especially of all Martial Adventures.
Here he was courteously entertain'd in 1388, for twelve Weeks, and to that
Earl he presented his Collection of <HI>Wenceslaus</HI> of
<HI>Bohemia,</HI> Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI>'s Book, called <HI>Meliader</HI>
or Songs, Ballads, Ron∣deaux and Virelays, which that Duke had composed, Vol.
II. fol. 30. He returned not into <HI>England,</HI> till King <HI>Richard</HI>
was arrived from his Expedition in <HI>Ireland,</HI> ib. fol. 252, and the
Peace was concluded for four Years between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> ib. fol. 251. b. which was in 1396; when he deliver'd Letters
of Recommendation to the said King, from the Earl of <HI>Heynault</HI> and
other Foreign Nobles; and was welcom'd by his Majesty, <HI>As one who had
been, and is of the English Court,</HI> ib. fol. 252. b. Then he presented
the King with a Book, fairly illuminated, which he had engrossed, and bound
in Crim∣son Velvet, with Silver Buttons and Clasps gilt, and golden
Roses, containing all the Matters of <HI>Amours</HI> and <HI>Moralities,</HI>
which in Four and Twenty Years before, he had compiled, ib. fol. 255. b. &amp;
251. b. One Copy of this Book, finish'd two Years before, <HI>Pasquier</HI>
saw in the Royal Library at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> as Monsieur
<HI>Bayle</HI> has remark'd. He continued moving about with the Court,
sometimes to <HI>Eltham, Kingston,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hene, Windsor,</HI> &amp;c. ib.
fol. 258. And was in this Court more than a Quarter of a Year together; and the
King received him kindly, because he was Clerk and Servant in his Youth to
King <HI>Edward</HI> and his Queen. And when he departed out of
<HI>England,</HI> which seems to be the same Year, King <HI>Richard</HI>
sent him a Goblet of Sil∣ver gilt, and in it a Hundred Nobles, ib. fol. 319.
We may presume he ended his Life when he left off his Chronicle, from his
expressing himself, upon the Delight he conceived in con∣templating the
Merits of his Subject, in these Words. 
<Q REND="inline">"The which excellent Matter, as long as I
live, by the help of God, I shall continue; for the more I follow and labour
it, the more it pleaseth me."</Q> Thus much of the <HI>Historian</HI>; as
to his <HI>Translator,</HI> with his other Writings and Actions, we refer to
them in <HI>Bale, Dugdale</HI>'s Baronage, and <HI>Wood</HI>'s <HI>Athen.
Oxon.</HI> Now a Word or two of the <HI>History,</HI> and we have done.</P> 
<P>And first we observe, That though the whole
<HI>Chronicle</HI> from the beginning of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. to King
<HI>Henry</HI> IV. passes currently under the Name of Sir <HI>John
Froissart;</HI> yet that there is a fine old MSS of it in <HI>England,</HI>
beautifully illuminated with Historical Figures, particularly of Sir <HI>John
Froissart,</HI> presenting his Book to the Kings of <HI>England,
France,</HI> &amp;c. which, in the very Title, distinguishes the Work to
have been begun by <HI>John le Bel,</HI> and continued to the Battle of
<HI>Poictou,</HI> and that then after his Death, it was compiled and finished
by the Venerable Sir <HI>John Froissart,</HI> which is agreeable to what he
says in his Pre∣face. So that though <HI>Froissart</HI> might here and
there correct or augment that first Part, as he also intimates; yet what he
com∣posed begins but at the Year 1356. This Observation, with that a∣bove
from his own Words, of his not coming so early into <HI>England,</HI> as
some have suggested, who wou'd from his Authority advance the Order of
the Garter up to the Year 1344, may clear him from disagreeing with our
Authentic Records, and antedating the Institution five Years, as Mr.
<HI>Ashmole</HI> has objected; the Error, if any there is in the said
Account, being more probably <HI>John le Bel</HI>'s, and, perhaps, the
Printer's rather than his. But here that we are speaking of MSS, we must
not forget one a∣mong those of <HI>Isaac Vossius,</HI> Canon of
<HI>Windsor,</HI> entitled, <HI>L'His toire de Froissart, plus ample,
&amp; plus correcte que les Imprimez,</HI> 2 Vol. Folio. From these, or
others still preserved both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> it has
been long and much desir'd, that we might have a more accurate Edition in
<HI>French,</HI> or Translation in <HI>English,</HI> than we have yet had.
'Tis true, the Author him∣self might not be always exact in the naming of
so many Per∣sons and Places as he has introduced; seeing he received his
In∣telligence from such Variety of Informers, in such distant Parts, and
so much from the <HI>Speech</HI> rather than the <HI>Writings</HI> of Men:
Yet surely his Copies owe little Correction to the Press, having undergone
the same Corruptions, which Books so much treating of <HI>English</HI>
Affairs, have usually suffer'd by being printed in <HI>France,</HI>
especially in the <HI>Names</HI> of Families, Towns and Lord∣ships: And Mr.
<HI>Selden</HI> has observed in his <HI>Tit.</HI> of <HI>Hon.</HI> p. 635.
That the <HI>Numerals</HI> in <HI>Froissart</HI> are also lamentably
corrupted and misprinted. Yet whoever will have the Patience to com∣pare his
Work, says Mr. <HI>Anstis, Ord.</HI> of the <HI>Gart.</HI> Vol. II. p. 98.
with the Coaevous Records publish'd by Mr. <HI>Rymer,</HI> will from that
Essay only, be so far satisfied of his Integrity, as may induce him
passionately to wish for a New Correct Edition: And if this Author has
not hitherto received the Honour of being printed at the <HI>Louvre</HI> with
some other Historians, according to the Proposal of the learned
Monsieur <HI>du Fresne,</HI> in <HI>Le Long, Bibl. Hist.</HI> p. 235.
upon the National Motive of praising his own Country too little, and ours too
much, see <HI>La Popeliniere, Hist. des Hist.</HI> lib. 8. and <HI>Bodin
Meth. Hist.</HI> c. 4. These Reasons, with the extraordinary Dearness
of the printed Copies, should excite some learned Person of this Kingdom,
for the Reputation of our own Country, to collate the MS Copies, compare the
Facts with Records, and contemporary Writers, and correct the misera∣ble
Mis-spellings, in the several Impressions, of their Surnames, who
abundantly signaliz'd their Valour, in Justice to the Merits of these
celebrated Persons, and in Honour to their Posterity. The most Ancient of
these <HI>Impressions</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> seems to be that printed
by <HI>Ant. Verard</HI> a Bookseller of <HI>Paris, Folio,</HI> with∣out Date.
The next was that printed also at <HI>Paris</HI> by three several
Persons, that is, The first Volume by <HI>Fra. Regnauld,</HI> the second
and third by <HI>Michael le Noir,</HI> 1505. The fourth by <HI>John Petit,</HI>
1518. The Copy of which Edition, now before us, bound in Two Tomes, Folio, has
the Arms of many of the Nobility, mentioned therein, drawn with a Pen in the
Margin. There was another Impression at <HI>Paris,</HI> by <HI>Ant.
Couteau,</HI> also bound in Two Volumes Fol. 1530. This was that chiefly
used by <HI>Denis Sauvage,</HI> Historiographer to King <HI>Henry</HI> II.
of <HI>France,</HI> in the Edition he revised and corrected from many Copies
and Abridgments; which was printed at <HI>Lyons,</HI> by <HI>John de
Tournes,</HI> Fol. 1559. and again, at <HI>Paris,</HI> in <HI>Folio</HI> 1574.
with Marginal Re∣marks, and Annotations at the End of every Book. He finds
fault with the preceding Editors, several Parts of whom he may have rightly
corrected, but is himself liable in many Places to Cor∣rection;
notwithstanding he has been so preferr'd, that a Copy of his Edition, has
been sometimes sold in <HI>England</HI> for <HI>Ten Guineas.</HI> We cou'd
wish that most of the Errors in these <HI>French</HI> Editions, were as
truly corrected in the <HI>English</HI> one, as Bishop <HI>Nicholson</HI>
imagin'd they were. In three of the Editions we have seen, neither the Books
nor the Chapters are divided alike; so that it is very tedious and
confusing to find, in one of them, the References of the other. Though
<HI>Froissart</HI>'s Method is some∣what diffuse and interrupted, yet
the Epitome we have of him in Print, is scarce worth mentioning, however
drawn up by <HI>Slei∣dan,</HI> such a Skeleton he has made of it, 12<SUP>o</SUP>
<HI>Franc.</HI> 1584, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with such Partiality, to the
prejudice of the <HI>English,</HI> has he so diminish'd it; according to
the Censure of our Learned <HI>Humphrey Lhuid in Comment. Brit.
Descrip.</HI> fol. 27. And yet it has been translated into
<HI>English,</HI> by <HI>P. Golding,</HI> and printed in a Quarto Pamphlet
1608. But, we shall now leave it, with our Wishes of better Treatment, in
the Character and Recommen∣dation of <HI>Montaigne</HI>; who, in his
<HI>Essay upon Books,</HI> describing the <HI>Sincere Historian,</HI>
who has nothing of his own intermix'd, but only diligently collects and
impartially records all Things without Choice or Prejudice, leaving intirely to
his Reader's Judgment the distinguishment of Truth, says, 
<Q REND="inline">"Such, for Ex∣ample, was honest
<HI>Froissart</HI>; who has proceeded, in his Un∣dertaking, with so frank
a Plainness, that having committed an Error, he is not ashamed to confess
and correct it, where∣soever it has been pointed out; and who represents to
us, even the variety of Rumours which were then spread abroad, and the
different Reports made to him; which is the naked and unaffected Matter of
History, and of which every one may make his Profit, according to the
Proportion of his Under∣standing."</Q></P></NOTE>. Then he proceeds to the
<HI>Chro∣nicles,</HI> divided under the many Chapters before-mentioned, 
<PB N="70" REF="95"/> of all which, though we cannot here precisely give the

(at the End said to be) <HI>Imprynted at</HI> London, <HI>by</HI> Abraham
Vele, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 1551. con∣taining 78 Leaves 8vo.</BIBL> To this is joined, <BIBL><HI>The</HI> Second Part, <HI>or Contynuacyon of the</HI>
ENGLISH VO∣TARIES; <HI>comprehendynge their unchaste Examples for</HI> 200
<HI>Years space; from the Year One Thousand, from Christes Incarnation,
to the Reign of King</HI> JOHAN; <HI>Collected of theyr owne Wryters, by</HI>
JOHAN BALE. <HI>Imprynted at</HI> London, <HI>for</HI> J. BALE, 1551,
<HI>&amp;c. Cum Privilegio ad im∣primendum solum.</HI> 120 Leaves 8vo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' the first Part of these <HI>English
Votaries,</HI> was <HI>Collected</HI> by our Author <HI>John Bale,</HI> in the
Year 1546, and the Second Part, in 1550, as appears in his Conclusions of
them: yet neither of them were <HI>printed</HI> till the Year 1551, which was
the Year before he was made Bishop of <HI>Ossory.</HI> In this Edition
was pro∣bably publish'd the Author's <HI>Dedication</HI> to King
<HI>Edward</HI> VI. however wanting in our Copy, which is otherwise a very
fair and perfect one: because, in the Edition printed on a larger Black
Letter, by <HI>John Tysdale, Anno</HI> 1560, which was after that King's
Death; we find such a Dedication of <HI>Bale</HI>'s to his said Majesty,
and also because we see, at the End of the Epistle to the Second Part,
even of the first Edition, there is a Wooden Print of our Author,
presenting his Book to the said King <HI>Edward.</HI> In this Dedication we
observe, that <HI>Bale</HI> design'd to publish Two Parts more of these
<HI>English Votaries,</HI> or Historical Exam∣ples of the abominable
Corruptions among our Bishops, Monks, Nuns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which wou'd have
deduced the said Collections down to his own Time: For his Words to the King
displaying the Scheme of the whole, by shewing what these two Parts
already publish'd do, and what those to be publish'd were to treat of,
are as follows. 
<Q REND="inline">"How the great Adversary of God,
Antichrist, hath sens Christes Ascention, wrought in his wicked
Course, to deprave these two Ministrations (the Explanation of God's
Word, and Govern∣ment of the People) and to cause them to serve his moste
blas∣phemous and filthy Affectes; the <HI>First Two Partes</HI> of my
<HI>English Votaries,</HI> here present, doth plentiously shew; and my
hope is, that the <HI>Two Lattre Partes</HI> which will, God wil∣ling, most
spedily follow, shal declare it yet much more at large. I have therein
decreed, for difference of the Bookes; and apt Arguments of the Matters
contained in them, to give them Four several Titles; of <HI>Rising,
Building, Holding</HI> and <HI>Falling.</HI> For the <HI>First</HI> Part
treateth of their Uprising to Mis∣chief by th' old Idolaters in the Reign
of Perdicion: The <HI>Se∣cond</HI> Part sheweth of their hasty Building by
the hipocritishe Monks to establish the wicked Kingdom of Antichriste:
The <HI>Third</HI> Part will declare the crafty upholding of their proud
De∣grees and Possessions, by the wily and subtil slaightes of the
Four Orders of Friers: And the <HI>Fourth</HI> Part shall manifest their
horrible Fall in this latter Age, by the grounded Doctrines of the true
Preachers and Writers."</Q></NOTE>.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>IN his Preface to the first Part, our Author says, of the
<HI>Popish</HI> Clergy, That, 
<Q REND="inline">"Not only have they commaunded unto us
Whoremongers, Baudes, Bribers, Idolaters, Hy∣procrites, Traitors, and most
filthy <HI>Gomorreans,</HI> as Godly Men and Women; but also they have
canonized them for <PB N="79" REF="106"/> most holy Saintes; set them up
gilt Images in theyr Temples, commaunded their Vigils to be fasted, appoynted
them Holy-dayes, and the People to do them Honour with Even Songes, Houres,
Processions, Lightes, Masses, Ringings, Sing∣ings, Censynges, and the
Devil and all of such <HI>Heathenish</HI> Wares. They have done by us, as
their old Predecessours the Idolatrous Priestes dyd by the ancient
<HI>Romanes</HI>; they have set up a Sort of lecherous Gods to be
worshipped in oure Temples, to be our Advocates, and to helpe us in our
Nedes. Instede of <HI>Jupiter, Saturne, Mercurye, Mars, Juno, Proserpina,
Diana</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> which did all their Feates in Whoredome, as the

<P>What we here have, is a diligent Collection from a great Variety
of many Foreign, as well as our own most ancient Historians, both in Print

scarce to be met with in Print, or never were prin∣ted; and, perhaps,
scarcely now to be recover'd in Manu∣script. The Book in the whole may be
useful upon many <PB N="86" REF="113"/> Occasions; tho' to be read with
some Grains of Allowance; the Zeal of its Author's Mind for the Reformation
requi∣ring, sometimes, itself, perhaps to be reform'd, for making him a
little too violent in his Sentiments, and gross in his Language.</P>

<BIBL><HI>A Discourse of</HI> ENGLISH POETRIE: <HI>Together
with the Au∣thor's Judgment touching the Reformation of our</HI> English
<HI>Verse. By</HI> WILLIAM WEBBE <HI>Graduate. Imprinted at</HI> London
<HI>by</HI> John Charlewood. Quarto, 1586.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE Author of this very scarce Pamphlet, consisting of five
Sheets and a half, <HI>dedicates</HI> it to <HI>Edward Suliard</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whose Sons were under his Tuition, and who had been
presented by him with some other Work before, which was a Translation of
some Poetry belike, from, or into <HI>Latin.</HI> In his <HI>Preface,</HI> To
the <HI>Noble Poets of England,</HI> he observes, that tho' <HI>Books</HI>
of, or tending to Poetry were, then, more numerous than any other
<HI>English</HI> Books, yet that 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Poetry</HI> has found fewest Friends to
amend it; those who can, re∣serving their Skill to themselves; those
who cannot, run∣ning headlong upon it; thinking to garnish it with their
Devises, but more corrupting it with fantastical Errors."</Q> Therefore the
chief end of his Writing this <HI>Discourse</HI> is, to propose a
<HI>Reformation</HI> of <HI>English</HI> Poetry, 
<Q REND="inline">"by having some perfect Platform, or
<HI>Prosodia</HI> of <HI>versifying</HI> ratified; either in Imitation of
the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> or, where it would not well abide the
touch of their Rules, thro' the like Observations, selected and
establish'd by the natural Af∣fectation of the Speech<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But this Project, tho' we find it was proposed and attempted by
other prime Wits of these Times before, such as Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI>
Sir <HI>Edward Dyer, Spenser,</HI> Dr. <HI>Gabriel Harvey,</HI> and o∣thers,
not succeeding; our end of reviving here, or reviewing this
<HI>Discourse,</HI> is chiefly for the sake of those Characters, which
our Author has given in it, of the antient, and more especially the
<HI>English Poets,</HI> from <HI>Chaucer</HI> and <HI>Gower,</HI> down to the
most considerable of those who flourish'd at the Time of this
Publica∣tion; that the critical Reader may better know, whether the O∣pinions
held of them in those Days, and ours, correspond; and better judge, from
the Conclusions we form upon the Writings of our Ancestors, what liberty
Posterity will take with our own.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="114"/>In the <HI>Discourse,</HI> having
spoken in general of Poetry, what it is, whence it had its beginning, and in
what esteem it has always been, according to <HI>Plato, Aristotle,</HI> and
<HI>Spen∣ser</HI> in his <HI>Shepherd's Calendar,</HI> which our Author
thinks in∣ferior neither to <HI>Theocritus</HI> nor <HI>Virgil,</HI> and
therefore zea∣lously wishes for his other Works abroad, especially his
<HI>English Poet,</HI> which his Friend <HI>E. K.</HI> did once promise to
publish; he then shews the Opinion that was held of the Power of Poetry;
how <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Scipio</HI> were delighted with it. So proceeds
to enumerate the most memorable Poets among the Ancients, as <HI>Orpheus,
Amphion, Tyrtaeus, Homer, Ennius,</HI> and <HI>Empedocles</HI>; with the
<HI>Comic, Tragic,</HI> and <HI>Pastoral</HI> Poets among the
<HI>Grecians</HI>; and in like manner the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets; more
particularly of <HI>Virgil</HI>; then of the <HI>Epi∣grammatic, Elegiac,</HI>
and <HI>Historical</HI> Poets. Of <HI>Ovid, Horace,</HI> besides many
others, and also, as not inferior to some of them, <HI>Palengenius,
Mantuan,</HI> and, for a singular Gift in a sweet Heroical Verse, matches
with them, <HI>Christopher Oc∣land,</HI> the Author of our <HI>Anglorum
Praelia.</HI></P>
<P>Hence he descends to the <HI>English</HI> Poets: And here
ob∣serves, that he knows of no memorable Work written by any Poet in
<HI>English,</HI> till twenty Years past; tho' Learning was not generally
decay'd at any time, especially since <HI>Wil∣liam the Conqueror</HI>; as
may appear by many famous Works written by Bishops and others; yet that
Poetry was then in little Account, the Light of the old <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Latin</HI> Poets which they had, being contemn'd by them, as appears by
their rude versifying, wherein they thought nothing to be learnedly written
in Verse, which fell not out in Rhyme, either by the middle Words of each
Verse sounding alike with the last, or every two Verses ending with the
like Let∣ters. The Original of which tinkling Verse is ascrib'd by Mr.
<HI>Ascham</HI> to the <HI>Hunns</HI> and <HI>Goths.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI>
I. sur∣nam'd <HI>Beauclerk,</HI> is here next spoken of, his Name being a
Proof that Learning in this Country was not little esteem'd of at that rude
Time; and that among other Studies it is probable such a Prince would not
neglect the Faculty of Poetry. But the first of our <HI>English</HI> Poets
here mention'd is <HI>John Gower</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Richard</HI> II.
a singular well learned Man, whose Works our Author wishes were all 
<PB N="88" REF="115" MS="y"/> whole and perfect among us, as containing much
deep Knowledge and Delight. <HI>Chaucer</HI> the God of <HI>English</HI>
Poets, next after, if not equal in Time, hath left many Works both for Delight
and profitable Knowledge, far exceeding any other that as yet, ever since his
Time, directed their Studies that way. Tho' his Stile may now seem blunt and
coarse, yet in him may be seen the perfect Shape of a right Poet. By his
delightsome Vein he so gull'd the Ears of Men with his Devices, that tho'
Corruption bore such a sway that Learning and Truth could scarce shew
themselves, yet without Controll might he gird at the Vices and Abuses of
all States, and gall them with very sharp and eager Inventions; which he did
so learnedly and pleasantly, that none therefore would call him in
question, <HI>&amp;c. Lydgate,</HI> for good Pro∣portion of his Verse and
meetly current Stile, as the Time afforded, is by our Author thought surely
comparable with <HI>Chaucer,</HI> yet more occupied in superstitious and
odd Mat∣ters than was requisite in so good a Wit; which though he handled
them commendably, yet the Matters themselves be∣ing not so commendable, his
Esteem has been the less. The next of our antient Poets he supposes to
be <HI>Pierce Ploughman,</HI> who is somewhat harsh and obscure, but
indeed a very pithy Writer, and the first our Author had seen who
observ'd the Quantity of our Verse without the Curiosity of Rhyme. Then
he comes to <HI>Skelton</HI> in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who as he
obtain'd the Laurel-Garland is, with good right, granted the Title of a Poet,
being a pleasant conceited Fellow, and of a very sharp Wit, exceeding bold,
and would nip to the very quick where he once set hold. After him is
mention'd Master <HI>George Gaskoyne,</HI> as painful a Soldier in the
Affairs of his Prince and Country as he was a witty Poet in his Writing; in
whose farther Commendation, he cites the Words of <HI>E. K.</HI> upon the
ninth <HI>Eclogue</HI> of the <HI>new Poet.</HI> Here he passes over
divers, as the old Earl of <HI>Surrey,</HI> the Lord <HI>Vaux, Norton,
Bristow, Edwards, Tusser, Churchyard, W. Hunnis, Haiwood, Sand, Hyll, S.
Y. M. D.</HI> because they would make his Discourse too tedious. But
observes, that the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> may challenge to himself the
Title of the most excellent, among the rest of the Lords and Gentlemen in
her Majesty's Court. Hence he proceeds to the Trans∣lators; among whom he
shall ever account Dr. <HI>Phaer</HI> the best, for his <HI>Virgil,</HI> as
far as half the tenth Book of the <HI>Ae∣neids,</HI> the rest being no less
commendably finish'd by that worthy Scholar and famous Physician <HI>T.
Twyne:</HI> Equal with <PB N="89" REF="116" MS="y"/> him he joins <HI>Arthur
Golding,</HI> for his Labour in <HI>Ovid's Me∣tamorphoses,</HI> who, for his
further profiting this Nation and Speech in all good Learning, is here greatly
extoll'd. The next Place is given to <HI>Barnaby Googe,</HI> besides his own
Com∣positions, for his Translation of <HI>Palengenius his Zodiac</HI>; and
he is follow'd by <HI>Abraham Flemming,</HI> with whom he would join another of
his Name, who had excell'd as well in all kinds of Learning as in Poetry
especially, were his Inven∣tions made publick. Here he apologizes for not
being par∣ticular on the Translators of <HI>Seneca, Ovid, Horace,
Man∣tuan,</HI> and many others; also the Students of the Universi∣ties and
Inns of Court, because he has not seen all he has heard of, nor dwells in a
Place where he can easily get knowledge of their Works. One however he may
not o∣ver-slip, and that is Master <HI>George Whetstone,</HI> a Man
singu∣larly well skill'd in this Faculty of Poetry. To him is join'd
<HI>Anthony Munday,</HI> an earnest Traveller in this Art, in whose Name
our Author had seen very excellent Works, especially upon Nymphs and
Shepherds, well worthy to be view'd, and to be esteem'd as very rare Poetry.
With these he places <HI>John Graunge, Knyght, Wylmot, Darrel, F. C. F.
K.</HI> and <HI>G. B.</HI> But here, has reserv'd a Place purposely for
one, who if not only, yet principally deserves the Title of the rightest
<HI>English</HI> Poet that ever our Author read, that is, the Author of the
<HI>Shepherd's Kalendar.</HI> And finds none fit to couple with him, unless
<HI>Gabriel Harvey,</HI> for his much admir'd <HI>Latin</HI> Poetry, his
Reformation of our <HI>English</HI> Verse, and beautifying the same with
brave Devices, tho' chiefly hidden in hateful Obscurity, and the Author long
since occupied in graver Studies. And if he were to join <HI>Harvey</HI>'s
two Bro∣thers, the one a Divine, the other a Physician, is assur'd, they
would much adorn the Art, if they would set their hands to it.</P>
<P>After his Judgment of the <HI>Poets,</HI> he speaks of the
<HI>English Poetry</HI> in its Matter and Form; what <HI>Verse</HI> is, the
Argu∣ments of primitive Poetry, the Comic, Tragic, and Histo∣ric; the Use
and End of Poetry from the Testimony of <HI>Horace.</HI> With his Advice, of
letting things, feign'd for Pleasure, nearly resemble Truth, how duely
observ'd by <HI>Chaucer.</HI> Others of <HI>Horace</HI> his Rules, with the
Translation of Sir <HI>Thomas Elyot</HI> of Reading lascivious Poems, and
what good Lessons some Readers will pick out of the worst of them.
Examples to this purpose, from <HI>Plautus, Terence, O∣vid,</HI> and
<HI>Martial,</HI> by Sir <HI>T. Elyot.</HI> Of Heroic Poetry, and 
<PB N="90" REF="117" MS="y"/> that we have nothing answerable to
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> im∣puted to our not having had a timely
regard to the <HI>English</HI> Speech, and curious handling of our Verse,
tho' now it has had great Advantages of Eloquence from some rare and
sin∣gular Wits; among whom, that Master <HI>John Lilly</HI> has de∣served
most high Commendations, as one who has step'd further therein than any
before, or since he first began the witty Discourse of his
<HI>Euphues.</HI> Whose Works surely in re∣spect of his singular
Eloquence, and brave Composition of apt Words and Sentences, let the learned
examine and make Trial thereof thro' all the Parts of Rhetoric in fit
Phrases, in pithy Sentences, in gallant Tropes, in flowing Speech, in plain
Sense; and surely, in my Judgment, I think he will yield him that Verdict
which <HI>Quintilian</HI> gives of both the best Orators,
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Tully:</HI> That from the one nothing may be
taken away; to the other, nothing may be added: But for a closer Example, to
prove a former Assertion, of the Fitness of our Language to receive the
best Form of Poetry, we are referr'd to the Examination of Dr.
<HI>Phaer</HI>'s Translation of <HI>Virgil</HI> with the Original, from both
which, here are several Examples laid before us, and our Critick thinks, that
the like Inference might be drawn from the Com∣parison of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s
<HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> with <HI>Golding</HI>'s Translation.</P>
<P>Next our Author treats more particularly of the Pastoral Poetry
or Eclogue: Here having spoken of <HI>Theocritus, Vir∣gil,</HI> and others,
he comes to one of our own Country, com∣parable with the best in any
Respect, even Master <HI>Spenser,</HI> Author of the <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s
<HI>Calendar,</HI> who wou'd, he thinks, have surpassed them, if the
Coarseness of our Speech (that is, the Course of Custom which he wou'd
not infringe) had been no greater Impediment to him, than their pure Native
Tongues were to them. Here we have a little Comparison between
<HI>Virgil</HI>'s Eclogues and <HI>Spenser</HI>'s, and the Commen∣dations of
<HI>E. K.</HI> upon the <HI>English</HI> Poet. The subject Mat∣ter, and
use of his said Calendar, and our Author's Apology for what had been
objected against something in his sixth Eclogue, shewing it is the
foolish Construction, and not his Writing that is blameable. To these
Writers of Pastorals, are join'd those who wrote Precepts of Husbandry in
Verse, after the manner of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Georgics</HI>; such as
that Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Tusser,</HI> a
Piece surely, says he, of great Wit and Experience, and withal very
prettily handled. And he thinks that this Argument has been so little treated
of in Poetry, because so many have written of it in Prose. As for a
Translation of <PB N="91" REF="118" MS="y"/> the <HI>Georgics,</HI> it appears
that <HI>Abr. Flemming</HI> in his Version of the Eclogues, did make some
Promise thereof, and that our Author <HI>Webbe</HI> did perform the like; but
it seems not that either of their Works were printed. Thence, from the
Subject of our <HI>English</HI> Writers, he passes to the Form and Manner
of our <HI>English</HI> Verse; censures our barbarous prac∣tice of
Rhyming; what is understood by Rhyme, and how improperly that Word is
apply'd. The first beginning of Rhyme. Rules to be observed in framing our
<HI>English</HI> Rhyme. Next we come to the several kinds of
<HI>English</HI> Verse, differing in Number of Syllables, where 'tis
observ'd the longest Verse in length, our Author has seen used in
<HI>English,</HI> consists of sixteen Syllables, not much used, and
commonly divided, each Verse equally into two, rhiming alternately. The next
in length is of fourteen Syllables, the most usual of all others, among
Translators of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, which also often is divided into
two Lines; the first of eight Syllables, the second of six, whereof the
sixes always rhime, and sometimes the others. But to avoid Tediousness
and Confusion, repeats only the different sorts of Verses in the
<HI>Shepherd</HI>'s <HI>Calendar,</HI> which contains twelve or thirteen
several sorts, differing in Length, or Rhime, or Distinc∣tion of the
Staves. After these Examples we have some Remarks, on the natural Order of
Words, or <HI>Position</HI> in <HI>English</HI> Poetry, and that the
quantity of our old Verse of fourteen Syllables, runs much upon the
<HI>Iambic:</HI> With further Observations upon Rhime. <HI>Gaskoyne</HI>'s
Instructions for versifying. Of some rare Devices and pretty Inventions
in Composition, as in the Song of <HI>Colin,</HI> sung by <HI>Cuddy</HI> in
the <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s <HI>Calendar,</HI> framed upon six Words, prettily
turn'd and wound up together. Not unlike <HI>John Graunge</HI>'s Device of
making the last Words of a certain Number of Verses fall into Sense: And
that there were several delicate Performances in this Nature of
<HI>Echoes,</HI> privately passing a∣mong the finest Poets of our
Author's Time. We have something also after the manner of the Acrostic,
from the Compositions of <HI>W. Hunnis.</HI> Then he proceeds to the
re∣formed kind of <HI>English</HI> Verse, in Imitation of the
<HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> which many had attempted to put in
Practice, and this Part takes up three Leaves, in which among other Things, he
observes the Hexameter to be the most famous Verse; and that the first
who attempted to practise it in <HI>English,</HI> was the Earl of
<HI>Surrey,</HI> who translated some part of <HI>Virgil</HI> into Verse;
but without regard of true quantity of <PB N="92" REF="119" MS="y"/> Syllables.
Here he repeats the famous Distich in <HI>Hexame∣ter,</HI> common in the
mouths of all Men, which was made by Master <HI>Watson,</HI> Fellow of St.
<HI>John</HI>'s College in <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> about forty Years past; and
two more in the Gloss of <HI>E. K.</HI> upon the fifth Eclogue of the new
Poet: That the great Number of the like kind made by Mr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> were
not unknown to any, and his own Translation of the two first Eclogues of
<HI>Virgil</HI> in the like sort of Verse, is by our Author here exhibited.
After which Examples in <HI>Hexameter,</HI> he comes to the <HI>Elegiac</HI>
Verse with Examples, and lastly, in like manner of the <HI>Sapphic,</HI>
with an Example thereof in his Version, from the fourth <HI>Eclogue</HI> in
the <HI>Shep∣herd</HI>'s <HI>Calendar,</HI> of <HI>Colin</HI>'s Song, sung by
<HI>Hobbinol</HI> in praise of the Queen. To the whole is annexed, The
<HI>Canons</HI> or <HI>Ge∣neral Cautions of Poetry,</HI> prescribed by
<HI>Horace,</HI> first gather'd by <HI>Geo. Fabricius Cremnicensis</HI>;
and at the End, a short <HI>Epi∣logue,</HI> in which for the rendering our
Poetry equal with the best in other Tongues, he gives us hopes of framing
some apt <HI>English Prosodia</HI>; but hopes first to enjoy the
Benefit of some others Judgment, whose Authority may bear greater Credit,
and whose Learning can better perform it.</P>

comprehended under the miraculous</HI> LIFE <HI>of St.</HI> WALBURG, <HI>the
Virgin Abbess; illustrated with copi∣ous Annotations, and Historical
Discourses, by Dr.</HI> JOHN L'ESPAGNOL, who was <HI>the</HI> Grand Prior
<HI>of St. Remy of Reims</HI>; treating of some Persons, who, for the
Holiness of their Lives, and the Magnificence of their Religious
Foun∣dations, were, as Natives of this Island, an Honour there∣to in Foreign
Parts, near a Thousand Years since; may on <PB N="93" REF="120"/> several
Accounts, merit the Notice of the <HI>British Libra∣rian</HI>; being such a
Rarity, as to have much escaped the Knowledge or Observation of those,
who have attempted to enumerate and characterise the Writers of our
<HI>Ecclesiastical History,</HI> or the <HI>Lives</HI> of our
<HI>Saints.</HI> The true Searchers after such Antiquities, are not to be
prejudiced, to the rejection of any solid Facts therein, by the religious
Delusions of those Miracles, in which they are sometimes envellop'd and
con∣vey'd; well knowing, that no such ancient Histories from
<HI>Popish</HI> Writers, wou'd be any ways secure from misleading us, if
some difference were not to be allow'd, and Distinctions practised in
Reading them: but on the contrary, if in such Subjects, the <HI>Reader</HI>

Religious Princess <HI>Reneé de Lorraine,</HI> Abbess of St.

Author's Prayer to St. <HI>Walburg,</HI> in which we shall forbear to
criti∣cise upon his Etymology of her Name, <HI>Valburgâ, fortè
quasi validum burgum,</HI> and pass to the Preface; from whence we learn
that our Author gather'd his Materials for the said <HI>Life,</HI> from the
Extract which <HI>Surius</HI> has made thereof, out of an ancient anonymous MS,
which our Author thinks might be written either by St. <HI>Wilibauld,</HI> who
did compile an Ac∣count of her Life, according to the Testimony of
<HI>Molanus,</HI> or by <HI>Wolfhard</HI> a Religious <HI>German,</HI> who
also wrote on the same Subject, according to <HI>Surius</HI> and Cardinal
<HI>Baronius.</HI> He has also collected something from what has been
written of her, by <HI>George Wicelius,</HI> and from a Tract composed by
<HI>Philip</HI> Bishop of <HI>Eyst,</HI> at the Request of a Queen of
<HI>Hungary</HI>; and says the <HI>Latin</HI> MSS. of the said
<HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Wolfhard</HI> upon this Subject, with others, were
printed at <HI>Ingolstad,</HI> in 1603; thro' the Care of <HI>Henry
Canisius,</HI> and that he has been furnished with several other little
Fragments and Memoirs from other Historians, who are cited in their proper
Places. After this Preface of two Leaves, we have a Summary of the Chapters in
this Life and Miracles of St. <HI>Walburg</HI>; at the End of that is a Table
of the Annotations and Discourses, deduc'd from, and referr'd to in the
said Life: This is followed with some <HI>Approbations</HI> of the Work, by
two Foreign, and two <HI>English</HI> Doctors at <HI>Reims,</HI> whose

Kellison:</HI> And lastly, An Extract of the King's Privilege for printing
the said Book, and securing the Property to the Author.</P>
<P>The chief Contents of the Life itself, which is comprised in

<BIBL><HI>The Maintenance of</HI> Free Trade, <HI>according to
the</HI> Three <HI>Essential Parts of Traffique; namely,</HI> Commodities,
Mo∣neys, <HI>and</HI> Exchange <HI>of Moneys, by Bills of Exchanges for other
Countries,</HI> &amp;c. By GERARD MALYNES, Mer∣chant, 8vo. 1622. <HI>Pages</HI>
105.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS little Work was written in Answer to a Treatise newly
published, entitled <HI>Free Trade, or the Means to make Trade
flourish;</HI> wherein, its Author had omitted to han∣dle the predominant
part, namely, the Mystery of <HI>Exchange</HI> between us and other Nations;
his only Scope being to have the Moneys of the Kingdom enhanced in Price, and
the Fo∣reign Coins, inconveniently, made current in the Realm at high Rates:
And because the said Treatise was publish'd at the Time when King
<HI>James</HI> had referr'd the consideration of this important Business
to <HI>Henry</HI> Viscount <HI>Mandeville,</HI> Lord President of the Privy
Council, with others of Know∣ledge and Experience, among whom, our present
Author Mr. <HI>Malynes</HI> was call'd, and did certify his Opinion; he,
therefore, dedicates this <HI>Answer</HI> to his Majesty.</P>
<P>In his said Dedication, he lays down, <HI>Traffic</HI> to be the
<HI>Preheminent Study of Princes,</HI> because the Sacred Wisdom has
approved this <HI>Axiom:</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"That a <HI>King</HI> is miserable, how
<HI>rich</HI> soever he be, if he reigns over a <HI>poor</HI> People; and
that a <HI>Kingdom</HI> is not able to subsist, how rich soever the
<HI>People</HI> be, if the <HI>King</HI> be not able to maintain his
Estate."</Q> He concludes with observing that, <HI>Worthy</HI> of
Commenda∣tion are those, who can, by Providence, <HI>preserve</HI> the
Trea∣sure of Kings and Commonwealths; <HI>worthier</HI> are those, who
both, by honest and lawful Means, can <HI>preserve</HI> and
<HI>augment</HI> them; but <HI>worthiest</HI> of all Immortal Praise are
those, who can, and do, by easy, just and politic Means, <HI>inrich</HI>
Kingdoms and Commonwealths, and thereby fill the Prince's Coffers with
standing Treasure, to serve in Time of War, when Arms are necessary,
and the Time of Peace, more fitting wholesome Laws. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the <HI>Theorick</HI> Part of which Study, I
have, says he, these forty Years spent much Time and Charges, at the
Pleasure of Great Per∣sonages: <PB N="97" REF="124"/> And albeit nothing did
encounter me but In∣gratitude, yet my Constancy to spend the Remainder of
my Days therein, in hope of <HI>Practice,</HI> is as immoveable, as the
Continuance of my daily Prayers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to multiply your Majesty's
Days, as the Days of Heaven."</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The knowing and
ingenious Author of this scarce and cu∣rious Tract, who thus spent Forty
Years in the Study of Means to enrich his Country by Traffic, was a Person of
such conside∣rable Note for his Abilities, that he was often called to the
Coun∣cil Table, both in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, and King
<HI>James</HI>'s, for his Opinion in <HI>Mercantile</HI> Affairs. He was
appointed one of the <HI>Commissioners of Trade</HI> in the <HI>Low
Countries,</HI> for settling the Value of Monies about the Year 1586. He was
afterwards a Commissioner also at Home in the Year 1600, for
establishing the true <HI>Par of Exchange</HI>; and upon the Laws, enacted
in the fourth Year of King <HI>James,</HI> for the making of good and true
Cloth, he exhibited a <HI>Demonstration</HI> to the Lords of the Privy
Council, shewing the <HI>Weight, Length</HI> and <HI>Bredth</HI> of all
sorts of <HI>Cloths</HI>; and that <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Measure</HI> do
controul each other; whereby the Merchant, who buys the Cloth, may be enabled
to find out the Fraud and Deceit of the Clothier: We find also that he
publish'd several other Books, besides this above abstracted; as, near
Thirty Years before it, <HI>The Canker of England's Com∣monwealth</HI>; also
<HI>England's View</HI>; and that he now had under the Press, a Volume
entitled <HI>Lex Mercatoria,</HI> or <HI>The Ancient Law Merchant,</HI> wherein
the dangerous Rocks to be avoided in the Course of Traffic, and the Means
thereunto con∣ducing, are manifested, for the Preservation and Augmentation
of the Wealth of these Kingdoms, according to <HI>Jus Gentium</HI>; the
Knowledge whereof is of such Moment, that all other Tem∣poral Laws, without
it are not complete. He writ also, <HI>The Royal Merchant of Great
Britain,</HI> which he had now in MS. and, perhaps, others, which we have not
leisure at present to en∣quire after.</NOTE></P>
<P>In his preliminiary Discourse, he distinguishes the
<HI>Three.</HI> Essential Parts of Traffic, namely, <HI>Commodities,
Money</HI> and <HI>Exchange,</HI> to be, the <HI>First,</HI> as the
<HI>Body,</HI> which upheld the World by Commutation and Bartering, till Money
was de∣vised; the <HI>Second,</HI> as the <HI>Soul</HI> in the Body,
infusing Life to Traffic, by the Means of Equality and Equity; the
<HI>Third,</HI> as the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Faculty</HI> of the
<HI>Soul,</HI> being seated every where, corroborating the vital Spirit of
Traffic, and di∣recting or controlling, by just Proportions, the Prices and
Values of Commodites and Moneys. A little further, he <PB N="98" REF="125"/>
tells an Ingenious Tale, which he applies to the Force of Exchange by
inferring, That the Author of the <HI>Treatise of Free Trade,</HI> is like
the Novices mention'd in that Tale, who perceiving two great Whales to have
assaulted the <HI>English Ship of Traffic</HI>; the one being the
<HI>Wars</HI> in <HI>Christendome,</HI> and the Pirates, and the other, more
gentle, being the <HI>Policy</HI> of Princes and States, hath publish'd the
<HI>Causes</HI> of the <HI>Decay of Trade</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the
Means to make the same flou∣rish, without observing the operative Power
of <HI>Exchange,</HI> which is the <HI>Rudder</HI> of the <HI>Ship of
Traffic,</HI> fastned to the <HI>Rule</HI> of the <HI>Equality</HI> of
<HI>Moneys,</HI> according to their Weight and Fineness.</P>
<P>The Treatise itself containing many observable Particu∣lars
is divided into five Chapters; the <HI>First</HI> whereof, is on, <HI>The
Causes of the want of Moneys in England.</HI> This Chap∣ter begins with
some Remarks on the Undervaluation of Money in Exchange, with an Instance
of the Value of <HI>Realls,</HI> and the <HI>Par of Exchange</HI>; when
<HI>Dudley</HI> Earl of <HI>Lei∣cester</HI> went Governour of the Low
Countries in 1586. Whence it is concluded, That, if the Low Exchange were not,
the Gain wou'd prove to be imaginary; that when the Exchange answers the true
Value of our Moneys, they are never exported, because the <HI>Gain</HI> is
answered by Exchange, which is the Cause of Transportation; so that
Exchange is still predominant, and strikes the stroke; and tho' the Price
rises and falls according to the plenty or scarcity of Money, yet Moneys
are over-ruled thereby: for if you enhance the Coin, the Exchange controlls it,
and rises accordingly; if you un∣dervalue it, the Exchange in like manner
falls, to the end that the Value thereof shou'd be answer'd by the public
Mea∣sure, and to prevent all Abuses in the Price of Commodities, and
Valuation of Moneys either Real or Imaginary, according to the Custom of the
Place, by device of the Bankers. That this was seriously observed in
1576, by the Lord Keeper <HI>Bacon,</HI> Lord Treasurer <HI>Burghley,</HI>
Secretary <HI>Walsingham,</HI> with other Counsellors of State, besides
many Persons of Experience, as Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham, Richard Martin,</HI>
Ma∣ster of the Mint, and many more here named; who found that the Bankers or
Exchangers for their private Gain, had brought in Twenty Inconveniencies, which
are here parti∣culariz'd: By which it may be seen, says our Author, of what
Importance the Operation of Exchange is, and where∣in the Endeavours of Sir
<HI>Thomas Gresham,</HI> thinking to rule the Exchange of <HI>England,</HI>
by plenty of Money, prov'd fruit∣less, <PB N="99" REF="126"/> which might have
been performed with more facility by Direction. Here we have Foreign Examples
from <HI>Bo∣din,</HI> of Bankers having their Goods confiscated, and being
indicted as Cozeners, seeing that in a short time with 24000 Pounds, they
had gotten 2400000. This is apply'd to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and in
what Case it wou'd have been more sensible of the like Loss; since,
tho' Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Coffers were stored with seven hundred
thou∣sand Pounds Sterling, before the Wars with the Earl of <HI>Ty∣rone</HI>
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> more than double that Sum had been spent therein.
<HI>The Second Cause of our Want of Money,</HI> is next imputed to the
superfluity of <HI>Plate</HI> in private Hands. Under this Head, is
observed the great Quantity of Silver con∣sumed in Silver Thread, Spangles,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon late Examina∣tion found, to amount to above fourscore
thousands Pounds yearly; whereas the Plate made in <HI>London,</HI> is only
fifty or sixty thousand Pounds worth. Here we have the several Opinions
given to <HI>Charles</HI> IX. of <HI>France,</HI> upon his want of Money, after
the <HI>Parisian</HI> Massacre; some, under colour of suppressing
Pride, advising him to prescribe every Man what store he shou'd keep,
and melt down the rest. Others, that he wou'd imbase his Money under the
Standard of Plate, so bring Plate to be turn'd into Money. This is follow'd
by another Example, in our <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who priviledg'd his Nobles to
make base Money of their own Plate, which fell
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut to the prejudice of the
Commonwealth, and was but a shift for the Time to himself. Then we have a
more par∣ticular Account of Gold and Silver Thread, both as to what the Author
had recommended in his <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>View,</HI> about making it at
home, and the Reasons why, by late Procla∣mation, the Foreign Manufacture
thereof was encouraged. <HI>The Third Cause of our want of Money,</HI> is
ascrib'd to the Con∣sumption of Foreign Commodities, or the buying them,
pro∣portionably, dearer than we sell our own, which he has proved (in his
<HI>Canker</HI> of <HI>England</HI>) to proceed from the A∣buse of Exchange.
Here we have the Causes of the over∣ballancing of Commodities, and the
Effects by which the <HI>English</HI> Merchants are bereaved of two
essential Parts of Trade in three. And here we see the Advantages which
Foreign Trade has over ours, and how our Commodities are fallen in Price; that
<HI>French</HI> Wines are dearer to us, by the Money of the Realm's being
undervalued in Ex∣change; and that the less Sterling Money we reckon in
Ex∣change with them, the more is the gain of our Commodities. 
<PB N="100" REF="127"/> <HI>The Fourth Cause is the Want of Money,</HI>
(according to the <HI>Treatise</HI> our Author answers, for these
Causes he takes from thence) is the great Want of our <HI>East-India</HI>
Stock at home; but our Author expected the ready Money sent in <HI>Reals</HI>
of Plate to be imploy'd in the said Trade, wou'd rather have been mention'd,
not but he thinks this <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, which began with us in
<HI>England,</HI> immediately after the great Jubilee Year 1600, might be very
profitable hereafter. He gives us an Instance in <HI>Pepper</HI>; which, if
it cost but Two-pence half-penny the Pound in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and Ten
Shillings employ'd therein, will require but 35 Shillings for all Charges to
deliver it in <HI>London,</HI> where it is usually sold for above
Twenty-pence; it follows there must be great Gain, which will encrease when
the Parties shall be united in true Love: Whereas the Loss we suffer by
the undervaluing of our Mo∣ney in Exchange, yearly, is greater than all the
Moneys em∣ploy'd yearly for the <HI>East-Indies</HI>; wherefore he is for
encou∣raging this Trade, and the rather for that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> found
Reasons, which are here produced, for continuing the same. Here we have
also some Observations upon our Riches, since the Discovery of the
<HI>West-Indies. The Fifth Cause of our Want of Money,</HI> imputed to the
Wars of <HI>Chris∣tendom</HI> causing Exportation, and the <HI>Pirates</HI>
hindring Impor∣tation of Money, is next examin'd. Here our Author argues, that
if the <HI>Pirates</HI> did not take some of our Money, it fol∣lows not that
the same wou'd come to us in <HI>Specie</HI>; and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Exportation by Wars, he answers to the
Argument, that the <HI>Rix-Dollar</HI> being raised in many Places of
<HI>Germany,</HI> shou'd draw abundance of Money into the Mints of those
Countries, that Money inhanced is never carried to the Mint, but runs away like
Post-horses, every Man fearing to lose by the Fall. We have here
several other Remarks upon these <HI>Dollar,</HI> and the Alterations of
their Value from the Year 1575; and the Chapter is concluded, with Advice to
note the Valuation of <HI>Hamborough,</HI> where it has been at fif∣ty-four
<HI>Stivers</HI> the Dollar, which makes the Exchange above forty Shillings of
their Money for Twenty of ours. 
<Q REND="inline">"And tho' we have raised the Price of Exchange
from Twenty-four Shillings, Nine-pence, to about Thirty-five Shillings, shall
we rest here and go no further? And shall we be like Men that halting in
Jest, become Lame in Earnest?"</Q></P>
<P>Chap. II. <HI>Shews the Causes of the Decay of Trade in the
Merchandize of England,</HI> by an Examination also of several Heads in the
manner aforesaid, as First, <HI>The Want of Money.</HI> 
<PB N="101" REF="128"/> Secondly, <HI>Extortionate Usury.</HI> Thirdly,
<HI>Litigious Law-Suits.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Free Fishery of Foreigners in his
Majesty's Seas</HI>; with the Reasons of our own Merchants in favour of
that Liberty, as if <HI>England</HI> cou'd not maintain a <HI>Sea</HI> and
<HI>Land Trade</HI> together; also several <HI>Examples,</HI> how other
Princes neglect not the Advantage to be made of their Seas, but both encourage
their own Subjects to fish in them, and make other Nations pay Duty for the
like: Which have long determin'd the question of <HI>Mare Liberum,</HI>
allowing the <HI>Freedom of the Seas</HI> for <HI>Navigation,</HI> where it
does not prejudice the distinct <HI>Dominion</HI> of Princes concerning their
<HI>Fishery.</HI> Fifthly, <HI>The Abuses of our Drapery.</HI> Here we have
a particular, that the dressing and dying of them, were insi∣sted on to
be done in <HI>England</HI> in 1616, and that then 64 Thousand Cloths were
exported; with a Digression of our Author's upon the envious Interpretation
of his Studies for the welfare of the Kingdom, particularly in his Invention of
<HI>Farthing</HI> Tokens, which are yet found most commodious to prevent the
waste of Silver, and relieve the Poor. Sixth∣ly, <HI>The Policies of
Merchants in monopolizing the Exportation of Cloths.</HI> Seventhly, <HI>The
false making of our Cloth.</HI> And here we have the Inconveniences of
engrossing in Trade further laid open. Eighthly, <HI>The Exportation of the
Mate∣rials of Wool,</HI> and the <HI>Customs</HI> or <HI>Impositions</HI>
laid upon Cloths at Home and Abroad. Ninthly, <HI>The Wars in Christendom,
and Pirates,</HI> occasioning the fall of Wool from 33 to 18 Shillings the
Tod, and the inconsiderate <HI>Barter</HI> of it Abroad. Tenthly, <HI>The
immoderate Use of Foreign Commodities,</HI> which concludes this Chapter.</P>
<P>Chap. III. <HI>Of Governed Trade and therein of Monopoly.</HI>
Here we have some further curious Observations upon the <HI>Exchange</HI>
of Money, and among others the Proverbial Cha∣racter in <HI>Bodin</HI> of a Man
of Experience and distinguishing Head, when they say, <HI>Il entend le
Par;</HI> also a <HI>Syllogism,</HI> up∣on the Undervaluation of our Money,
and a Comparison of <HI>Exchange</HI> to the <HI>Assay</HI> of Money.
Commendations of Ma∣ster <HI>Hussey,</HI> Governor of the
Merchant-Adventurers, in the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, for
the great Pains he took in settling the <HI>Parity</HI> of Exchanges, however
the true Remedy to rule the Course of them, was but lately found out. The
Opinions of mercantile Men upon the <HI>best Methods</HI> of Traffic, with
our Author's Discussions thereup∣on; as, <HI>Whether Foreign Nations
shou'd come and fetch our Wares? And whether there shou'd be no Societies
or Corpora∣tions</HI> <PB N="102" REF="129"/> <HI>of Merchants?</HI> Which tho'
our Author is for allowing, under Government, in appointed Places, because
they may, by such Order, be remov'd, or recall'd; and for that no Nation
trafficks so much in the bulk of staple Commodities; insomuch, that two
Years before the taking of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> all the Wares in
<HI>Christendom</HI> vented there, in one Year, being valued, the
<HI>English</HI> amounted to four Parts in six: Yet we must not flatter
Companies or Societies, says he, in their unadvised or irregular
Proceedings; for a Society may be∣come a Monopoly, when some few Merchants
have the whole managing of a Trade to the hurt of a Commonwealth, and when many
others might also negotiate for the common good. Here we have a Definition of
a <HI>Monopoly,</HI> and an Approbation of the Custom in the City of
<HI>Noremberg</HI>; where they receive all the Manufactures of the People, and
paying these weekly, sell those for a reasonable Profit. This is
fol∣lowed with some Observations on the Royal Commodity of <HI>Tin,</HI>
which above 100 Years past, was sold for 40 Shil∣lings the Hundred, when
the best <HI>Velvets</HI> were sold for 10 Shillings the Yard. Also of
the Abolition and Re-establish∣ment of <HI>Prae-emption,</HI> whereby the
Wealth of the Kingdom has been since encreased 600 Thousand Pounds
<HI>Sterling,</HI> and his Majesty received for his Benefit 150 Thousand
Pounds. Also how the Importation of <HI>Spanish Tobacco,</HI> gains the
Kingdom many Thousand Pounds yearly. Next we have his Opinion upon <HI>Joint
Stocks</HI> in Companies; and last∣ly, the general Intention of all Grants,
by <HI>Letters Patent,</HI> for New Inventions; with Reflections upon those,
especial∣ly relating to <HI>Alloms,</HI> rendering the Commodity dearer to
the Subject, and cheaper to the Transporter or Stranger; which he resembles
to the Silver Mines of the Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> maintained at his own
Charge, called the <HI>Wild∣man</HI>; which cause him to coin Dollars, having
his Arms on one side, and a Savage Man on the other, holding a burning Candle
in his Hand, with this Inscripton, <HI>Aliis inserviendo,
consumor.</HI></P>
<P>Chap. IV. <HI>Of want of Government in Trade.</HI> And herein he
sets down the Errors in Trade, committed by Merchants, relating to Cloths,
and the making over their Moneys beyond Seas. Then he proceeds, First, To
enu∣merate the <HI>Defective Means and Remedies,</HI> no less than
Thirty-five, which have been tried these 350 Years, and next, to shew,
wherein they have been found fruitless, and that the decrease of Wealth in
a Kingdom, may be compre∣hended <PB N="103" REF="130"/> under these Heads: The
selling our Native Com∣modities too cheap, buying Foreign Wares too dear, and
exporting our Money in Specie, or exchanging it for Money by Bills; and how the
Undervaluation thereof causes it to be exported or hinders the Importation.
This leads us, in the last Place, to</P>
<P>Chap. V. <HI>Of the Remedies for all former Causes of the Decay
of Trade.</HI> Here he begins with his Remedies, First, For the
<HI>undervaluing</HI> our Money, by <HI>overvaluing</HI> Foreign Coin; and
these are, by the Reformations of <HI>Exchange</HI> here proposed, in
causing the Value of our Money to be given in Exchange; which wou'd out off
the Gain had by the Exporta∣tion of it, and make Foreign Coin not to be
received above Value. More particularly, how, this recovery of
<HI>England</HI>'s Wealth is to be effected by Proclamation, and by publick
Tables, fixed up at the <HI>Royal Exchange;</HI> like those kept at
<HI>Dover</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. to receive the
Passenger's Money, and by Exchange in Specie for it be∣yond Seas; which
made them leave their Moneys in the Realm. Further also, by taking warning
from the Incon∣veniencies of inhancing Moneys; in several Examples of King
<HI>Henry</HI> VI. who raised the Ounce of Sterling Silver from 20 to 30
Pence, and King <HI>Edward</HI> IV. from 30 to 40 Pence. And King
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. his raising the <HI>Angel No∣ble</HI> from 6 Shillings
and 8 Pence, to 7 Shillings and 4 Pence, and afterwards to 7 Shillings and 6
Pence, whereby every Ounce of <HI>Sterling</HI> Silver was worth 45 Pence; yet
there was nothing effected thereby, the Money still altering beyond Sea.
Wherefore <HI>Wolsey</HI> had power given to alter the Valuation from time to
time as he saw cause. Soon after, it is shewn how the <HI>Turks,
Persians</HI> and <HI>Russians</HI> are, by keeping the Price of their
Exchanges above the Valuation of their Mo∣neys, more politick than we. Hence
the Question is re∣solv'd, whether it is more expedient to raise the
Price of Exchange or the Valuation of Money. Next he shews how the want of
Money has sunk the Price of <HI>Plate,</HI> from 5 Shil∣lings and 8 Pence to
5 and 2 Pence, and what wou'd be the Conseqence of its rising. Here he
recommends all wrought Plate to be try'd and mark'd, also all Silver Thread
from abroad; and that they shou'd receive our Wool in Ex∣change for it. The
Consumption of Foreign Commodities or over-ballancing of them, is referr'd to
the Considerations upon the Abuse of Exchange before: And the excessive
Use of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> to the Limitation of <HI>Spanish Tobacco</HI>
lately esta∣blish'd, <PB N="104" REF="131"/> that the Plantations of
<HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Bermudas</HI> may be advanced thereby. The want of
Money thro' the <HI>Wars</HI> and <HI>Piracies,</HI> is compris'd in the
Reformation of <HI>Exchange</HI> and the Policy of <HI>Rewards.</HI> Thus
having, to the Causes of the want of Money, join'd some Means for
supplying it; he comes to the Remedys also for the Decay of Trade: And
here, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Under the Head of <HI>Usury,</HI> to be remedied by
Money procur'd as afore directed, he recommends the Custom of setting over
<HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Debt</HI> from one Man to ano∣ther; and a Stock to erect
<HI>Pawn-Houses</HI>; and for principal Towns to take in Money upon the
Adventure of their own or other Men's Lives; as at <HI>Venice,</HI> where a
Man, for three or four Hundred Pounds, shall be sure of one Hundred Pounds
a Year for Life. The <HI>Third</HI> Cause of Decay in Trade, ascri∣bed to
litigious Law-Suits, our Author thinks there can be no shorter Course to
remedy than is us'd upon Proof and Specialities, if the Pleadings and
Issues be join'd according to the first Institution; whereby the
<HI>Matter of Fact</HI> may ap∣pear before a Jury: For touching the <HI>Matter
of Law,</HI> it, being separated, makes a <HI>Demurrer</HI> to be determin'd
by the Judge. Here he commends the Course in <HI>Germany,</HI> to take down
litigious Humours, where a Fine of Twelve-pence in the Pound, or more is paid,
to the Emperor or Magistrates, for so much as is claim'd of the Defendant
more than can be proved to be due, besides further Charge, if he be found to
proceed upon Revenge. As for the Differences between Merchants, he refers to
his <HI>Lex Mercatoria</HI>; as also the <HI>Fourth</HI> Remedy, in behalf of
the Fishing Trade. The <HI>Fifth</HI> upon making Cloth abroad, is partly
redress'd by the late Proclamation, to prohibit Exportations of that kind.
And the Rules of our Author for the true making of Cloth, may be a Remedy for
the <HI>Seventh</HI> Cause of Decay, as also to the <HI>Eighth</HI>; but
the <HI>Sixth,</HI> concerning the <HI>Policy of Merchants,</HI> is
recommended, for the general and not particular Good, to the Inspection of a
Committee; so that other Merchants may upon reasonable Considerations be
admitted of the said Companies. The <HI>Ninth</HI> Cause is partly handled
in the <HI>First,</HI> and as to <HI>Bankrupts,</HI> some Remedy is
assign'd also before, in setting over Bills of Debt; and the Defects in
the Statute against them, is to be remedied by the Authority of
<HI>Chan∣cery,</HI> to the Commissioners appointed to examine the same.
The Remedy to the <HI>Tenth</HI> and last Cause of our said De∣cay, the
Immoderate Use of Foreign Commodities, con∣sists, as was observed
before, partly in reforming the Abuse <PB N="105" REF="132"/> of Exchange,
whereby such Abundance is imported, and partly in restraining the
Affectation of the Vulgar, to imi∣tate their Superiors, by their being deprived
of their Ill Examples. Our Author concludes, That all these Causes of the
Decay of Trade in <HI>England,</HI> are mostly comprised in that One, the
<HI>Want of Money,</HI> whereof the <HI>Abuse of Ex∣change</HI> is the
<HI>Efficient</HI> Cause; which made him project so easy <HI>a
Remedy;</HI> whereby the Kingdom shall enjoy the <HI>Three Essential
Parts</HI> of Traffic, under Good and Politic Govern∣ment, which will
effectually produce a <HI>Free Trade.</HI></P>

<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Anno</HI> 1647. MS. <HI>Folio. Pages</HI> 304<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This spacious and beautiful MS. bound in <HI>Blue Turkey</HI>

<HI>Tilson,</HI> but, by Correction, as it is above. We find that his

writ the Conclusion of this Book, at least, so late as the Year 1652. If
some few Mistakes have escaped in the Blazonry, or in the Historical
Account of the Alliances and Issue, they are not greater, perhaps, than
what might be rea∣sonably expected in any other Heraldical Work, where such
Distinctions are undertaken; especially in such Extent of Time, and,
consequently, such Variety of Families.</NOTE>.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the Margins of this <HI>Title-Page,</HI> we have the Arms of
Twenty of our Kings <HI>before</HI> the <HI>Conquest,</HI> painted in their
proper Colours; that is, from <HI>Egbert</HI> down to <HI>Harold,</HI> who
lost the Kingdom to <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman.</HI> 
<PB N="106" REF="133"/> And the <HI>Preface,</HI> is <HI>A Discourse
concerning the Nobility of England, according to the Laws of England.</HI> The
begin∣ning whereof, for a Taste of the Author, we shall here give in his
own Words. 
<Q REND="inline">"As in the Body natural, for the Pre∣servation
of the whole, the different Temperature of Hu∣mours, and Offices in several
Members, are requisite: So likewise in the Body Civil, or Politic,
different Estates and Degrees among Men have been judged as necessary.
And as the Elements cannot be intermingled one with another, except it be by an
unequal Proportion and Temperature: So Civil Societies cannot possibly be
preserved, but by a certain Inequality; which is apparent by the different
Forms of Government, observed and establish'd in all Countries: And the
ancient Policy of this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> being govern'd by
<HI>Royalty,</HI> ever since it was known to be an in∣habited Piece of Earth,
hath admitted of a Threefold Divi∣sion of Persons, <HI>viz. King,
Nobles,</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI>; which hath been a Government very Ancient,
and fully under∣stood, both by Magistrates and People; and rooted in Mens
Affections both by long habituated Excercise, and the well approved Benefits
received thereby."</Q></P>
<P>After this, he proceeds to distinguish the several Degrees,
or Titles of Honour; and first of the <HI>King,</HI> and his Sove∣reign
Power. That many of his Rights are termed <HI>Flowers of the Crown</HI>; in
which respect <HI>Bracton,</HI> speaking of them, says, The King's
<HI>material</HI> Crown is adorned with <HI>Flowers.</HI> Also, that some
of his Rights are by positive, or written <HI>Laws</HI>; others by right of
<HI>Custom.</HI> And that the <HI>Regalia,</HI> or Ensigns of Royalty,
especially the <HI>Crown, Scepter, Purple Robe,</HI> and <HI>Golden
Ball,</HI> are as old among us, as King <HI>Ar∣thur,</HI> according to the
Testimony of <HI>Leland.</HI> Next he shews, That the <HI>Nobility,</HI>
comprehend the <HI>Prince, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts,</HI> and
<HI>Barons</HI>; as the <HI>Commons,</HI> consist of <HI>Knights,
Esquires, Gentlemen, Yeomen, Artificers,</HI> and <HI>Labourers.</HI> Which
last are not here further spoken of, <PB N="107" REF="134"/> this Work
confining itself to the superior <HI>Nobility.</HI> There∣fore, having
given us the Derivation of <HI>Nobilitas,</HI> from the Word <HI>Nosco,</HI>
as one known, or <HI>notable</HI> for his Vertue, or the reward of it, he
distinguishes, why they are called Peers, and the whole Body of them the
Baronage; what difference there is in their Parliament Robes; how they are
tryed by the whole Body, and in what Cases they retain both their
<HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Surnames</HI>; then descends more particularly
to their several Degrees. Here we see, That the Title of <HI>Prince,</HI>
was called by the <HI>Saxons, Aetheling:</HI> That the <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> only
call'd him the <HI>King's Son,</HI> and the <HI>first begotten</HI> of the
King of <HI>England,</HI> till King <HI>Edward</HI> I. summoned his Son
<HI>Edward</HI> to Parliament, by the Title of <HI>Prince</HI> of
<HI>Wales</HI> and Earl of <HI>Chester</HI>; and <HI>Edward</HI> III. created
his Son Duke of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> since which this Title has been
appropriated to the King's first Son. That as for the Title of <HI>Duke,</HI>
it was first of <HI>Charge</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> not of <HI>Dignity,</HI>
after the A∣bolition of the <HI>Roman</HI> Government here; and that this
De∣gree in the Days of <HI>Constantine</HI> was inferior to that of
<HI>Co∣mites</HI>; moreover, upon what Conditions this Title of Duke was
conferr'd, as also that of Earl, or what Qualifications were requir'd in
them; namely, Faithfulness and Valour ap∣proved, with the Protection of
Widows and Orphans; that People, under their Regiment, might with Joy continue
in Peace. That the Title began under <HI>Otho</HI>; but in <HI>England,</HI>
not before King <HI>Edward</HI> III. created his Son <HI>Edward</HI>
aforesaid, and also his two other Sons; from which time we have had
Hereditary Dukes. That the <HI>Marquess</HI> was not known to us, till King
<HI>Richard</HI> II. made his Minion <HI>Robert Vere</HI> Earl of
<HI>Oxford,</HI> Marquess of <HI>Dublin;</HI> and became not till then a
Title of Honour, for before, those who govern'd the <HI>Marches,</HI> were
commonly called Lord <HI>Marcheres.</HI> The Title of <HI>Earl,</HI> some
think to be derived from the <HI>Germans,</HI> who had their <HI>Comites</HI>
according to <HI>Tacitus</HI>; but others think it came from the
<HI>Romans,</HI> and that before <HI>Constantine</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> the
Name of <HI>Comes</HI> was not used as a Title of Honour. That after the
dissolution of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, this Title of Earls was retained
by our <HI>English Saxons;</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> termed them by a Word,
signifying Honourable, which, somewhat mollified, agrees with what we at
present call them. That they became not, before the <HI>Normans</HI> got
footing here, Feudal, Hereditary and Patrimonial, as ap∣pears by
<HI>Domesday-Book.</HI> After that, they were created with the Additional
Name of a <HI>Place,</HI> and Assignment of the <PB N="108" REF="135"/>
<HI>Third Penny</HI> of the Shire, as appears by the Empress <HI>Maud's</HI>
Creation (the most ancient Form which has been seen) of <HI>Geoffrey
Mandevill, Earl</HI> of <HI>Essex.</HI> And King <HI>John</HI> was the
first we meet with, who used the Cincture of a Sword in their Creation, and
they waited at his Table there with it by their Side. It was the next Age
before the Imposition of a Chaplet, Cap of Honour with a Circlet of Gold came
up, which after that, as at this Day, was turn'd into a Coro∣net with Rays or
Points. The <HI>Earls Palatine</HI> were rec∣kon'd most Honourable, and
<HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> held the Earldom of <HI>Chester,</HI> as freely by the
Sword, as the King held <HI>England</HI> by the Crown. To which was added, the
distinction of bearing the Sword at Coronations; called <HI>Curtana,</HI>
which being blunt betokened Mercy. This Earl ordained Barons and Abbots to
serve in his Parliament, who with him made Laws for the Government of his
County. Earldoms of Title without Place, as the <HI>Earl Marshal</HI> of
<HI>England,</HI> be∣gan under King <HI>Richard</HI> II. who gave that Title to
<HI>Thomas Mowbray</HI> Earl of <HI>Nottingham.</HI> As for
<HI>Viscounts,</HI> it is also an old Name of Office, but a new one of
Dignity; not be∣ing known among us for a Title of Honour before King
<HI>Henry</HI> VI. who created <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Beaumont, Viscount
Beaumont.</HI> Here 'tis remarked, That after a Man is cre∣ated an Earl or
Viscount, or any other Title of Honour a∣bove them, his Title becomes parcel
of his Name, and not an Addition only, and in all Legal Proceedings he must
be stiled by that Dignity. <HI>Lastly,</HI> We come to the <HI>Barons.</HI>
And here 'tis observed that our ancient <HI>Britons</HI> did not ac∣knowledge
the Name, and that in the <HI>English Saxon</HI> Laws it is not seen: That
in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Glossary of <HI>Alfricus,</HI> a∣mong the Vocables or
Terms of Honour; <HI>Dominus</HI> is trans∣lated <HI>Laford,</HI> which we
have contracted into <HI>Lord,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> called their Free
Lords, who equall'd the Barons of our Time, <HI>Thani.</HI> And that in a
Fragment of the Laws of <HI>Canute,</HI> was the first mention of a
<HI>Baron</HI> with us; yet there∣in, according to the Varieties of Copies, is
indifferently read, <HI>Virones, Barones,</HI> and <HI>Thani.</HI> The Service
of these Barons appears from the Laws of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, into
which those Ordinances of <HI>Canute</HI> are translated in the
<HI>Norman</HI> Tongue, where it being ordain'd, That the <HI>Heriot</HI> or
<HI>Relevies</HI> should be moderate, and those of an <HI>Earl,</HI>
men∣tion'd, it appears that some of those Accoutrements (for the Wars) to
be raised by the <HI>Barons,</HI> were but half in propor∣tion; as, four
Horses, two Swords, four Spears, and four <PB N="109" REF="136"/> Targets; but
for the rest, only one Helmet, one Coat of Mail, and in Money only 50
<HI>Mances</HI> or <HI>Marks</HI> of Gold, which are but a fourth Part. Also
after the coming of the <HI>Normans, Valvasors</HI> and <HI>Thanes</HI> were
ranged in Degree next after <HI>Barons</HI>; and our learned Interpreters have
thought the Dignity of <HI>Barons</HI> was comprehended un∣der the
<HI>Valvasores Majores,</HI> afterward called <HI>Capitanii,</HI> and that
the like Dignity was, by the <HI>English Saxons</HI> before the Conquest
called <HI>Thanes,</HI> according to <HI>Lambert</HI> in his
<HI>Per∣ambulation</HI> of <HI>Kent.</HI> Neither was the Name of
<HI>Baron</HI> then granted to be of great Honour, some <HI>Earls</HI> having
in those Days their <HI>Barons</HI> under them, of which here are Examples
produced. A few Years after they were accounted <HI>Barons,</HI> who held an
entire <HI>Barony,</HI> consisting of 13 <HI>Knights Fees</HI> and one
Third, which amounted to 400 Marks yearly: A <HI>Knight's Fee</HI>
consisting of 12 <HI>Carves</HI> of Land, a <HI>Carve</HI> of 8
<HI>Oxgangs,</HI> an <HI>Oxgang</HI> of 15 Acres. These <HI>Baronies</HI>
were held, some of the King, and those who had them of this Value, were
taken for <HI>Barons</HI> by Fee, to which was annexed a Dignity with
Jurisdiction; which the <HI>Court Barons</HI> in some sort prove. In King
<HI>Henry</HI> IIId's days, there were reckon'd in <HI>England</HI> 150
<HI>Baronies.</HI> But this Dignity attained to its highest Honour after that
King in the 49th Year of his Reign, summon'd a select Number to the
Parliament, and they of the most ancient Families and excellent
Qualifica∣tions, and decreed that none other shou'd come; which his Son
<HI>Edward</HI> I. also constantly observ'd. Hence they were only
accounted <HI>Barons,</HI> whom the King by such Writs of Sum∣mons did call
to Parliament. And 'tis observ'd, to the great Glory of this King
<HI>Edward,</HI> that he did always direct his said Writs to those of the
best Families, and whose Wisdom and Virtues were answerable: But
pass'd over their Sons af∣ter their Death, if they were not equal to their
Parents in Understanding and all other commendable Qualities. Here we have
some curious Questions debated upon this Head, as, <HI>Whether a Barony by
Writ, may descend from the An∣cestor to the Heir? Whether it may descend
to the Heir Fe∣male, who is nearer a-kin than the Males? And whether, if it may
descend to such Females, their Husbands may assume the Style and
Dignity of such a Barony.</HI> Herein are Argu∣ments produced on both sides
of these Questions, after which follow others, to compound the
Controversy, by our Author. So from the Nature, Quality and State of 
<PB N="110" REF="137"/> <HI>Barons</HI> by <HI>Writ,</HI> he passes to
<HI>Barons</HI> by <HI>Creation,</HI> begun by King <HI>Richard</HI> II. And
for the Explanation of this Dignity, here also are some Questions
resolved. Then he proceeds to discourse of <HI>Barons</HI> by
<HI>Tenure</HI>; or such as held any Ho∣nour, Castle, or Manor, as the Head
of their Barony, by Barony, or Grand Serjeanty: That they were
<HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal,</HI> the former of whom having lost
their Seat in Parliament, 17 <HI>Car.</HI> he says nothing more of them; but
of the Temporal <HI>Barons</HI> by <HI>Tenure,</HI> having shewn that such
there were, he lays down some Arguments and Examples to determine the
Question, <HI>Whether after alienating the Lands by which they hold, they can
retain their Title and Dignity?</HI> Thus having touch'd upon the Original,
Nature and diffe∣rent Degrees of our <HI>Peerage,</HI> he concludes, with
some Ob∣servations upon their <HI>Privileges,</HI> this his Preface,
consist∣ing of Twenty-six Pages.</P>
<P>The Work begins with a Display in one Leaf, of the <HI>Arms</HI>
of our Kingdom under its different Governments, in five several
<HI>Scutcheons,</HI> representing in their proper Co∣lours, those of the
<HI>Saxons, Romans, Britons, Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Normans</HI> in the
middle. So we turn over, and begin with the Nobility under <HI>William</HI> the
<HI>Conqueror</HI>; and first with <HI>Edgar Etheling,</HI> who was
<HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI> before, and at the coming of the said
<HI>William</HI> into <HI>England.</HI> A short Account being given of this
Earl, and his Arms painted on the side of it, we have two other contemporary
Nobles treated of after the like Manner, in the same Page; and this regular
Method of Historizing three Noblemen in every Page, with the
<HI>Blazonry</HI> of their Arms in the Mar∣gin, except where the Pages and
Scutcheons are not fill'd up, which is very rare, is pursued through every
Reign. That of the Conqueror, taking up 28 Pages, consequently gives account
of 84 Noblemen. After this, the <HI>Noblemen</HI> of every Reign, are led up by
the Arms of every <HI>King</HI> then reigning, in the middle of a Blank Leaf,
and nothing more written under them than the Name of the King. We ob∣serve no
<HI>Quarterings</HI> in the King's Arms, from the Con∣quest, till we come to
<HI>Edward</HI> III. nor any <HI>Supporters</HI> of, or <HI>Badges</HI> over
them, till then: But from hence they con∣stantly appear, changing with the
several Lines or Races of the said Kings. In the Reigns of <HI>William</HI>
aforesaid, King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles,</HI> are the greatest
Number of No∣blemen; in which last, Baron <HI>Sutton</HI> is the last
mention'd; <PB N="111" REF="138"/> and in the Reigns of <HI>Henry</HI> IV.
<HI>Richard</HI> III. <HI>Henry</HI> VII. <HI>Edward</HI> VI. <HI>Mary</HI> and
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> especially as this last reigned so long, there are
the fewest Noblemen mention'd. Other Observations upon this MS. and
Deductions from them, might be made; but at this Time, these may suffice in
this Place.</P>

<BIBL>ACADEMIARUM EXAMEN, or <HI>The</HI> EXAMINATION <HI>of</HI>
ACA∣DEMIES. <HI>Wherein is discussed and examin'd the Matter, Method and
Customs of Academic and Scholastic Learning, and the Insufficiency
thereof discover'd and laid open. As also some Expedients proposed for
the</HI> Reforming <HI>of</HI> Schools, <HI>and the perfecting and promoting of
all kind of Science: Offer'd to the Judgments of all those who love the
proficiency of Arts and Sciences and the Advancement of Learning.</HI> By JOHN
WEBSTER. Quarto, 1654. <HI>Pages</HI> 110.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE Author <HI>Dedicates</HI> this Tract to Major General
<HI>Lambert,</HI> having had experimental Knowledge and Trial of his Abilities,
for the reforming of <HI>Academies,</HI> and of his sincere Affection and
unparallel'd Love to <HI>Learning.</HI></P>
<P>In his <HI>Epistle, To all who truly love the Advancement of
Learning in the</HI> Universities of <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI>
or elsewhere; he anticipates several Objections, which might be raised
against so private a Person as himself, for undertaking thus freely, to
handle an Argument of this publick Nature and Consequence. And one of them,
where he suggests he shou'd be look'd upon as a <HI>Leveller</HI>; he
answers, by say∣ing, 
<Q REND="inline">"He must needs so far own <HI>Levelling,</HI>
that he holds <HI>plain</HI> Dealing to be a Jewel, and that <HI>plain</HI>
Ways seem to him most secure and comfortable: That the <HI>Prelacy,</HI>
tho' it sought to bow him, cou'd not break him: That tho' the
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> Pride did seem to threaten him, it cou'd not hurt him;
and the <HI>Independent</HI> Forms cou'd never inform him beyond the Basis of
a better Building than Man can erect. That the spoil of Aca∣demies cou'd
never please his Mind, nor shou'd they <PB N="112" REF="139"/> fill his
Purse. That he was no Dean, nor Master, Pre∣sident, nor Provost;
Fellow, nor Pensioner; nor had Tythes appropriate, or impropriate;
Augmentation, or State Pay. That all the <HI>Levelling</HI> in these Times,
had not mounted him, nor cou'd they make him fall lower: And he that wou'd
raise himself by the Ruins of others, or <HI>warm</HI> himself by the
<HI>burning</HI> of <HI>Schools,</HI> he wishes no greater Plague than his
own <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or that he may ever gain more <HI>Knowledge</HI> than
to live to repent."</Q> There are certainly many good Observations in the
Book; and if a few Animadversions might by Critical Exami∣ners, be made upon
his Style in some Places, and, per∣haps, his Choice of exceptionable Matter,
or the Efficacy of his Expedients, for the Reformation propos'd; yet the Work
will still demand regard for the eminency of the At∣tempt, and a Subject of
such great Importance, may ren∣der the most imperfect Hints in it so, to
Heads which can raise out of them more effectual Improvements. But in∣deed,
this Matter is not feebly recommended by the Au∣thor himself, as in other
Parts of the Work, so in the Con∣clusion of the <HI>Epistle,</HI> wherein
having inform'd us, That he intends not to asperse the Person of any, nor
to traduce or calumniate the <HI>Academies</HI> themselves; but only the
Corruptions which Time and Negligence have introdu∣ced there, and simply to
attempt some <HI>Reformation,</HI> not <HI>E∣radication</HI> of their
Customs and Learning: 
<Q REND="inline">"He adds, which, tho' I have, peradventure, but
weakly managed, yet I hope my poor Mite, with the Candid and Ingeni∣ous, will
be accepted; for the rest, I value them not; and I intreat the more able to
supply, what my want of Strength hath left incomplete. I have rather intended
this as an <HI>Essay,</HI> to break the Ice to some more able Judgment,
than as sufficient of itself to perform what is aimed at; because I have
neither performed what I shou'd have done, nor what I cou'd, but only traced
out some few clear Things, as a guide to higher and more noble
Undertakings."</Q></P>
<P>After some Verses, by his Friends, in praise of the Au∣thor
and his Work, he enters upon it, divided under <HI>Ele∣ven Chapters,</HI> in
the following Manner. I. <HI>Of the general Ends of erecting Public
Schools;</HI> under which, he tells us; 
<Q REND="inline">"If the <HI>Academies</HI> had kept within their
own Sphere, and on∣ly taught <HI>Human Science,</HI> and had not, in Pride and
Vain-Glory, mounted into the Chariot of the Sun like <HI>Phae∣ton</HI>; 
<PB N="113" REF="140"/> they had then, neither disorder'd, nor injur'd
<HI>Theo∣logy,</HI> that is above them, nor the Things of Nature, which they
account below them."</Q> II. <HI>Of the Division of Academic Learning, and
first of School Theology.</HI> Hence, having spoken of Perplexities wherein
the presumptuous Imaginations of Mankind have ensnared and intangled
them∣selves, he proceeds to, III. <HI>The Division of Human Learning; and
first of Tongues, or Languages.</HI> Herein the greatest Objection is, the
making some Sciences meerly speculative; as <HI>Philosophy,</HI>
according to that of <HI>Seneca; Nostraque erat</HI> Philosophia,
<HI>facta</HI> Philologia <HI>est, ex qua, disputare dicemus, non
vivere;</HI> and the like of <HI>Mathematicks.</HI> Then he pro∣ceeds to divide
the Sciences in a manner most commodi∣ous for his Purpose; beginning with
those subservient or conducive to others, as <HI>Grammar;</HI> under
which he com∣mends Dr. <HI>Webb</HI>'s Enterprize of teaching the
<HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, by an easy <HI>Clausulary</HI> Method; and the
elaborate Pains of Mr. <HI>Brinsley.</HI> So descends to the recommendation
of <HI>Hieroglyphical, Emblematical, Symbolical</HI> and
<HI>Cryptographi∣cal</HI> Learning, all relative to <HI>Grammar</HI>;
inferrable from the Labours of <HI>Oughtred, Harrington, Spanheim, Porta,
Trithe∣mius, Agrippa, Claramuel, Silenus,</HI> and Frier <HI>Bacon,</HI> with
the like Praises of a <HI>Universal Character, Dactylogy,</HI> the <HI>Real
Character</HI> of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> and <HI>Jacob Behmen</HI>'s
<HI>Language of Nature.</HI> After his Observations upon these Relatives to
Grammar, he goes on to discourse in the IV. Chapter, <HI>Of Logic.</HI> And
here shews what a <HI>Civil War</HI> of <HI>Words</HI> it is made; the
Imperfections of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s System, and of <HI>Logic</HI>
itself; with the Consequence of <HI>Tully's Alphabetical</HI> way of
<HI>Syllogizing,</HI> and concludes with Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Opi∣nion of
<HI>Logic,</HI> as it is abused. So we come to V. <HI>The Ma∣thematical
Sciences.</HI> And here he complains how shame∣fully the Foundation-Stone to
this great Building, <HI>Arithme∣tic,</HI> has been neglected or thrown aside
by our <HI>Academic</HI> Masters, and but for some private Spirits, such
as <HI>Napier, Briggs, Oughtred</HI> and a few others, it had lain as a Garden
unweeded. The like is observed of <HI>Geometry</HI>; also, how lately, by
how few, and those Foreigners, any <HI>Optical</HI> Im∣provements appear'd.
That <HI>Music</HI> has indeed had some Pains and Honour shew'd to that
Part of it, which is the concomitant of, or Spur to Voluptuousness; which
is the Companion of Melancholics, Fantastics, Courtiers, Ladies, Taverns, and
Taphouses. But any higher Advancements of it, for discovering natural
Knowledge, and the Harmony of the <PB N="114" REF="141"/> Universe remains
unattempted. The Absurdities of our Scholastic Systems of
<HI>Astronomy,</HI> are next largely laid open; as that the Earth is the
Centre of the Universe, and the hea∣venly Orbs immutable; that they are
solid Bodies, the Ve∣locity of the Tenth Sphere, and of the Eighth, or Starry
Sphere. In <HI>Cosmography</HI> the Deficiences are next mention'd,
especially in the mutual Correspondence and Application of the Heavens and
Earth; nor are the Theorems of <HI>Hy∣drography</HI> brought into Practice,
whereby Men might be made able for Navigation. <HI>Astrology,</HI>
notwithstanding all the Derogation of the Schools, and Discredit brought
upon it, by the Ignorance and Knavery of pretended Sciolists, our Author
recommends as a laudable and profitable Study; and arraigns the negligence of
Universities for having so lit∣tle regarded the Improvement of <HI>Statics,
Architecture, Pneumatithmy, Stratarithmetry,</HI> and the rest enumerated by
the learned Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> in his Preface to <HI>Euclid.</HI> Hence we pass
VI. <HI>To Scholastic Philosophy.</HI> Herein <HI>Aristotle</HI> is
pull'd to pieces, from the beginning to the end, and Reasons drawn for
denying the Palm to the <HI>Peripatetic</HI> Philosophy, from the uncertainty
we are in, both as to his Books and Doctrine, as also the defectiveness of
those which we least doubt to be his; whence we are led to observe, in
what Parts of Physical Knowledge the Schools are most deficient, and
these are <HI>Natural Magic, Chymistry, Medicine, Anatomy, Surgery,</HI>
and <HI>Physiognomy,</HI> Coelestial and Subcoelestial,
<HI>Onei∣rocratics</HI>; besides the <HI>Magnetical</HI> Philosophy, for
which Dr. <HI>Gilbert, Ridley, Carpenter, Barlow</HI> and <HI>Cabaeus,</HI> are
so much commended; and the <HI>Atomical</HI> Learning, reviv'd by
<HI>Descartes,</HI> and improv'd by <HI>Magnenus, Regius, White, Dig∣by,
Phocyllides, Holwarda,</HI> and others. Then we proceed, VII. <HI>To
Metaphysics, Ethics, Politics, Oeconomics, Poesy</HI> and <HI>Oratory.</HI>
Where having shewn what airy, insufficient, de∣lusive, and meer
Ornamental Assistances they are made, and thus run over some defects of
<HI>Academic</HI> Learning, tho' not all, intimating that a great Part
deserves to be eradicated, some reform'd, and all meliorated in our said
Schools, he moves on to VIII. <HI>Their Customs and Method,</HI> leaving
their Manners and Maintenance to others. Here the first Ob∣jection is, that
tho' there are divers Houses in one Univer∣sity; yet all Students must
follow one another like Carriers Horses in one accustom'd Path. The
second, is the sloth∣ful Performance of their Scholastic Exercises,
their Public Acts being kept but four Times in a Year. 3. The Injury of 
<PB N="115" REF="142"/> tying all Men to one set Course of Years, before
they can re∣ceive their Degrees. 4. The ridiculous Levity of their historical
Personations in the performance of their Exer∣cises. 5. Their empty and
windy Disputations therein, without any Foundation from Industry, or
practical Expe∣rience. 6. Their Confinement in all Exercises to the
<HI>La∣tin</HI> Tongue. 7. Too much admiring Antiquity. 8. Being bound in with
multiplicity of Voices. 9. Adhering to Au∣thority, especially of
<HI>Aristotle.</HI> 10. The Immethodical Course of instructing Youth in
<HI>Logic</HI> and <HI>Natural Philoso∣phy,</HI> before they have tasted
the Rudiments of <HI>Mathemati∣cal Knowledge</HI>: But as before an old
Building is demolish'd, a Platform is usually devised for a better. So
our Author in Cap. IX. Offers some <HI>Expedients or Remedies in Theology,
Grammar, Logic and Mathematics</HI>; wherein, though he thinks what he has
before produced for demonstrating the ill Composure of the
<HI>Scholastic</HI> Fabric of Learning, not far from the Truth, and tho' he
here acknowledges his own Insufficiency to make a more serviceable
Substitution: yet, <HI>In magnis, voluisse, sat est.</HI> He will do
his Endea∣vour, and hopes that abler Hands will supply his Defects. Having
offer'd his said Means for regulating the Study of these Sciences, he
continues after the like manner, to treat in Cap. X. <HI>Of some Helps in
Natural Philosophy</HI>; in which he highly celebrates the Writings of Dr.
<HI>Flud.</HI> So gives us lastly, in Cap. XI. <HI>Some Expedients concerning
their Custom and Method:</HI> And hopes they will be acceptable till better
be found out.</P>

<BIBL>PLUS ULTRA: <HI>or, The</HI> Progress <HI>and</HI>
Advancement <HI>of</HI> KNOWLEDGE <HI>since the Days of</HI> Aristotle:
<HI>In an Account of some of the most remarkable late</HI> Improvements
<HI>of practical, useful</HI> Learning, <HI>to encourage</HI> Philosophical
En∣deavours: <HI>Occasioned by a Conference with one of the</HI> no∣tional
<HI>Way.</HI> By JOS. GLANVILL, 8vo. 1668. <HI>Pages</HI> 149. <HI>Besides
Dedication and Preface.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE Intention of this Treatise is, by assembling such a
Variety as it contains, of new Improvements in all Sci∣ences, to raise able
and pregnant Heads from a drousy Ac∣quiescence in the Discoveries of
former Times, and tempt them from those Modern Advancements, with
Encourage∣ments to proceed. And tho' the Author intends not a full History of
the said Improvements, and their Authors; yet the most remarkable of them
are instanced, at least so far as may serve his aim of confuting his
Antagonist, and exci∣ting Philosophical Endeavours: In which he has has a
prin∣cipal regard to the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> by giving a succinct
Ac∣count of the Purposes and Productions of that Illustrious Assembly,
for the Information of such as have not met with their excellent
History.</P>
<P>After his <HI>Dedication</HI> to <HI>William</HI> Bishop of
<HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and his <HI>Preface</HI> to the Clergy of
that Diocese, we come to the <HI>Work</HI> itself; which, in the running
<HI>Title,</HI> is called, <HI>Mo∣dern Improvements of useful Knowledge</HI>;
and is divided into <HI>Eighteen</HI> Chapters, tho' the whole is written by
way of Letter to a Friend. The first Chapter containing his Intro∣duction,
shews the Occasion of writing this Treatise, to have proceeded from a
Dispute the Author had with an old Clergyman in his Neighbourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Name was as we find elsewhere, Dr. <HI>Robert Cross,</HI>
Rec∣tor of <HI>Chue</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> in which Country, our
Author <HI>Glan∣vill</HI> was Rector of <HI>Bath,</HI> afterwards Chaplain in
Ordinary to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and Prebendary of <HI>Worcester. A.
Wood</HI> says of him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he was a Person of more than ordinary
Parts, of a quick, warm, spruce and gay Fancy, and was more lucky, at least
in his own Judgment, in his first Hints and Thoughts of Things, than in his
after Notions. He had a very tena∣cious Memory, and was a great Master of the
<HI>English</HI> Language, expressing himself therein with easy
Fluency, and in a manly, yet withal a smooth Style."</Q> Tho' the said Dr.
<HI>Cross</HI> wrote a Book against this <HI>Plus Ultra,</HI> he cou'd not
get it printed; and tho' Dr. <HI>Stubbes</HI> also wrote another against
it, the same was not much regarded. See a further Account of this <HI>Plus
Ultra</HI> in the <HI>Philos. Transactions.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 36.</NOTE>, who was
so wedded <PB N="117" REF="144"/> to the <HI>Peripatetic</HI> Philosophy,
and extoll'd <HI>Aristotle</HI> so far above all Comparison, as to
contend, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he had more Advantages for Knowledge, than
either the Royal Socie∣ty, or all the present Age."</Q> But, says our
Author, in the Conclusion of this Chapter, 
<Q REND="inline">"As my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> observes well,
<HI>Philosophy as well as Faith must be shewn by its Works:</HI> And if
the <HI>Moderns</HI> cannot shew more of the Works of their Philosophy in
six Years, than the <HI>Aristote∣lians</HI> can produce of theirs in more
than <HI>thrice</HI> so many <HI>hundred,</HI> let them be loaded with all
that Contempt, which is usually the reward of vain and unprofitable
Pro∣jectors."</Q> Chap. 2. <HI>Is upon the Ways of improving useful
Knowledge,</HI> First, by enlarging the History of Things, and next by
improving Intercourse and Communications: Also upon the Advantages of this
Age, from the great Advance∣ments of Chymistry and Anatomy. Here we have a
brief recital of the many Discoveries made in the Body of Man, and the Names
of the Physicians who made them; more par∣ticularly, of the
<HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Transfusion</HI> of the <HI>Blood.</HI> Chap. 3.
<HI>On the Advantage of late Times from the Improvements of Mathematics,</HI>
particularly in <HI>Arithmetic,</HI> by <HI>Logarithms, Napier</HI>'s
<HI>Bones,</HI> and <HI>Decimals</HI>; also in <HI>Algebra</HI> and
<HI>Geometry,</HI> and by whom they have been improved. Chap. 4. Is upon
<HI>the Improvements,</HI> more particularly in <HI>Geometry,</HI> by <HI>Des
Cartes, Vieta,</HI> Dr. <HI>Wallis, Harriot</HI> and <HI>Oughtred.</HI> Chap.
5. <HI>The late Improvements of Astronomy</HI>; in the Performances of
<HI>John de Sacro Bosco, Regiomontanus,</HI> who publish'd the first
<HI>Ephemerides, Clavius, Tycho Brahe, Copernicus, Galilaeo, Jacobus
Metius,</HI> Inventor of the Telescope, <HI>Scheiner, Kepler, Bullialdus,
Hevelius,</HI> and several others, ending with Dr. <HI>Seth Ward,</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> who had demonstratively proved the Elliptical
Hypothesis. Chap. 16. Recites <HI>the Im∣provements of Optics and
Geography.</HI> Here we learn that <HI>Roger Bacon</HI> so much commended, by
<HI>Picus Mirandula</HI> and <PB N="118" REF="145"/> <HI>Vossius,</HI> wrote
accutely of <HI>Optics</HI>; by what Hands <HI>Dioptrics</HI> also were
improved, and that in <HI>Geography</HI> likewise, Improve∣ments have been
great, as may be found, by comparing the Works of some Moderns here named,
with the best Re∣mains of the Ancients. Chap. 7. Is upon <HI>the Aids of
useful Knowledge by Instruments, as the</HI> Telescope, Microscope
<HI>and</HI> Thermometer. Chap. 8. <HI>Of the</HI> Barometer <HI>and</HI> Air
Pump; <HI>and what Advantages we have and may further expect from them.</HI>
Chap. 9. <HI>The Credit of</HI> Optic <HI>Glasses vindicated against his
Antagonist.</HI> Chap. 10. <HI>Our Advantages for Knowledge from Modern
Improvements of Natural History;</HI> in the <HI>Hea∣vens, Air, Earth;
Waters,</HI> by several Hands, and the <HI>subter∣raneous World,</HI> by
<HI>Kercher.</HI> In <HI>Plants</HI> also by several, and <HI>Trees,</HI>
particularly Mr. <HI>Evelyn,</HI> from whose <HI>Elysium Britan∣nicum</HI>
greater Things were to be expected, as he has already oblig'd the World with
many other Things on <HI>Sculpture, Pic∣ture, Architecture,</HI> &amp;c. Also
in <HI>Animals,</HI> and chiefly Man: That all the Heads of <HI>Natural
History,</HI> have received Aids from the famous <HI>Verulam,</HI> who led
the way to <HI>substantial</HI> Wisdom, and has given most excellent
<HI>Directions,</HI> for the Method of such an <HI>History</HI> of
<HI>Nature.</HI> Chap. 11. <HI>The Ad∣vantages of late Ages for spreading of
Knowledge, by</HI> Print∣ing <HI>the</HI> Compass <HI>and the</HI> Royal
Society. Chap. 12. <HI>Of the Royal Society, the Reasons of the Institution
and their Designs, with an Answer to the Question,</HI> what have they
done? Chap. 13. <HI>An Account of what has been done by the Illustri∣ous
Mr.</HI> Boyle, <HI>for the Promotion of useful Knowledge;</HI> gi∣ving an
Account of the Books he had publish'd, and what Knowledge he had advanced in
them. Chap. 14. <HI>Gives a further Account of the Works, Mr.</HI> Boyle
<HI>had by him unpub∣lished,</HI> for the Advantage and Improvement of real
Know∣ledge; and what Reasons there were to hope for great Things from the
<HI>Royal Society.</HI> Chap. 15. The <HI>Absurdity</HI> of making
<HI>Comparisons,</HI> between the Advantages <HI>Aristotle</HI> had for
Knowledge, and those of <HI>later Ages.</HI> Chap. 16. The <HI>Reason</HI>
of some Men's superstitious <HI>Adherence</HI> to the <HI>notional</HI>
way, and of the <HI>Disputer</HI> who gave occasion to this
<HI>Discourse.</HI> Chap. 17. Treats more particularly of the
<HI>Peripatetic</HI> Philo∣sophy, and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> as he concerns
the <HI>Universities.</HI> Lastly, in Chap. 18. We have some
<HI>Arguments</HI> of our Author with his Antagonist about the
<HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Scriptures;</HI> particu∣larly, that God was
pleased in his <HI>Inspirations,</HI> to apply him∣self much to the
<HI>Imagination</HI> of the <HI>Prophets.</HI> Then comes the
<HI>Conclusion,</HI> containing Observations about the Censure 
<PB N="119" REF="146"/> of <HI>Atheism,</HI> apply'd to
<HI>Philosophical</HI> Men; with the Au∣thor's <HI>Apology</HI> to the

<BIBL>The <HI>Institution, Laws</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of
the most <HI>Noble</HI> ORDER <HI>of the</HI> GARTER: <HI>Collected and

<HI>and</HI> Noblesse. <HI>Fol.</HI> 1672. <HI>Pages</HI> 720, besides
the Appendix.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS elaborate and costly Performance being adorned with fifty
Copper-Plates, etch'd by the famous <HI>Hollar,</HI> might have still been
more complete, by that further Addi∣tion to the <HI>Lives</HI> of the
<HI>Knights Companions,</HI> which our Au∣thor intended, had not some
malicious Insinuations withheld the Encouragement, he was very near
attaining, to re-im∣burse his Expences therein; as we have learn'd from his
own Words, both in Print and Manuscript<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>His Words in Print are these. 
<Q REND="inline">"We once intended a full and entire History
of the <HI>Lives</HI> of these Noble <HI>Founders,</HI> and to that purpose
made a large and chargeable Collection out of the Records in the Tower of
<HI>London,</HI> and elsewhere, of all that we could find worthy to be
remember'd in them; in which we spent most part of the Years 1657, 1658,
1659. But this our Design being afterwards represented (20 <HI>Feb.
Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> II.) to the present Sovereign and Knights
Com∣panions, by the late <HI>Chancellor of the Order,</HI> through the wrong
End of the Perspective; we thereby received so great Discou∣ragement, as
caused us to wave it, and indeed resolved wholly to lay it aside.
Nevertheless, upon other Thoughts, we are content to let in a
<HI>glimpse,</HI> of what may be improved to a far greater <HI>Light</HI>;
and from that Stock of Collections have drawn out some few Things relating to
the <HI>Founder,</HI> and first 25 <HI>Knights</HI> Companions; particularly,
their Honours, Martial Employments, famous Exploits, Matches, Issues and
Deaths; therein laying down only <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> and
<HI>Materials</HI> for <HI>History,</HI> without <HI>Deductions</HI> or
<HI>Observations:</HI> All which we shall deliver with the plainness
there found, being unwilling to add other Rhetorical Flourishes, lest we
might withal cast some blemish upon the native Beauty of Truth." 
<BIBL><HI>Order of the Garter,</HI> fol. 643.</BIBL></Q></P> 
<P>But from a MS. of his own Writing, we find Mr.
<HI>Ashmole</HI> first took this <HI>Work</HI> of the <HI>Garter</HI> into
Consideration about the Year 1655: That the Charges of his
<HI>Collections</HI> for it, amount∣ed to 500<HI>l.</HI> before the
Restoration, and to no inconsiderable Sum after it: Yet observing how
meagre the Memorials were, which had been preserved of the <HI>Ancient</HI>
Companions; he peti∣tion'd the King in <HI>August</HI> 1660, that his
Majesty wou'd add to the other Officers of the Order, a particular
<HI>Historiographer</HI> and a <HI>Remembrancer,</HI> with the Salary of only
100 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> as ne∣cessary to transmit their Noble Companions
for the future more suitably to Posterity; and modestly hoped to have the
same be∣stow'd upon himself, as what might bring some Authority to his
Performance, lighten his Charges, and raise him above the de∣triment of
Censure. King <HI>Charles,</HI> having been inform'd of his <HI>Reasons,
Labour, Expences</HI> and <HI>Qualifications,</HI> signed a Warrant for the
same, directed to Sir <HI>Henry de Vic, Chancellor</HI> of the
<HI>Order,</HI> authorizing the Patent to be pass'd under the Seal thereof.
But the said Chancellor refused to pass it, under pre∣tence of Mr.
<HI>Ashmole</HI>'s Irregularity in procuring it, and not only alledg'd he
ought to have obtained his first Grant by the Hand of the said
<HI>Chancellor,</HI> and the <HI>Chapter,</HI> that is, (as Mr.
<HI>Ashmole</HI> himself words it) have sought it of those who wou'd
obstruct it; but in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1661, laid an <HI>Information</HI> thereof
before the <HI>Chapter</HI> then held, and Mr. <HI>Ashmole</HI> was not
admitted either to make a <HI>Defence</HI> of himself, or shew the
<HI>Advantages</HI> of the <HI>Office</HI> propo∣sed, so it was laid
aside; and he presented a Draught in Writing of the <HI>Objections</HI>
there made against such an Institution, and his <HI>Answers</HI>
thereto, which he dedicated in <HI>Dec.</HI> 1662, to the Lord
<HI>Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> From which MS. <HI>Of his Arguments
for an Historiographer and Remembrancer to the Order of the Garter,</HI> we
have extracted thus much of this Paragraph; and shall only observe, that
such a discouragement of an Attempt <HI>to write Hi∣stories and Lives of
such Great Men, in the complete Circuite of their Stories,</HI> seems no
ways wonderful. For this is <HI>Biography</HI> in its strict Sense; which
is of a searching Nature; and, however useful or acceptable to the
generality, as irksome to some Thoughts, as Light to some Eyes; yea, may
be as terrible to some among the Living, as to others, the Expectation of
being <HI>anatomiz'd</HI> when they are dead. However King <HI>Charles</HI>
re∣warded this Author, who thus <HI>ennobled</HI> even the most
<HI>Noble</HI> Or∣der like a Prince, who deserved to be, as he was, the
<HI>Sovereign</HI> thereof, with Places of above a <HI>Thousand Pounds</HI> a
Year; and not long after the Book was publish'd, and inscrib'd to his
Majesty, Mr. <HI>Ashmole</HI> further received, a Privy Seal out of the
Custom of Paper, for <HI>Four Hundred Pounds,</HI> as we find in the
<HI>Diary,</HI> he left behind him, of his own <HI>Life.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="147"/>The Work itself, is, not without some
seeming Respect to the Subjects of it, distinguish'd into
<HI>Twenty-six Chapters,</HI> and they subdivided into several
<HI>Heads,</HI> containing many cu∣rious Remarks and Instructions of
Antiquity; and not only concerning the <HI>Legal</HI> and <HI>Ceremonial</HI>
Parts of this <HI>Order,</HI> but of many other Institutions, Customs,
Habits and Forms of Honourable Distinction among Mankind: As may be best
seen by the <HI>Particulars</HI> of those Chapters and Heads, which are
here drawn together, with some necessary Enlargements, from the Bodies
also of those Heads; that the <HI>Contents</HI> of the Book may be the
better known, and our Readers ac∣commodated with the greater Variety of
Intelligence.</P>
<P>Chap. I. <HI>Treats of Knighthood in general.</HI> Which be∣gins
with a Section upon <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Honour;</HI> shewing that Virtue
is encouraged by Reward, and that Honour is the re∣ward of Military Vertue;
that they were deified by the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> who built them various Temples;
and we have here the Sculpture of one erected for <HI>Vertue,</HI> which
stood before that of <HI>Honour,</HI> mystically implying that
<HI>Honour</HI> was not to be attained by any other ways than by
<HI>Vertue.</HI> Hence we <PB N="121" REF="148"/> proceed to the Antiquity of
<HI>Knighthood</HI> among the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Foundation of the

Endowments and Privileges.</P>
<P>Chap. V. <HI>The Institution of the most Noble Order of the

said Order, and a Refutation of <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI>'s Fiction of its
rise from <HI>the King's taking up the Queen's, or his Mi∣stress's
Garter.</HI> Hence we are led to the <HI>True Cause</HI> of this Martial
Foundation, which was to emulate <HI>King Arthur's Round Table,</HI> so we
proceed to <HI>the Time when it was institu∣ted;</HI> and here it appearing
that King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Robes for the <HI>first</HI> Feast, not being
made till the 22d or beginning of the 23d Year of his Reign, and the
<HI>Statutes</HI> of the Institution fixing it in his 23d Year; the first
Feast might not be held till the 24th. Agreeable to what we read in
<HI>Fabian,</HI> and more expresly in <HI>Stow, Lilly, Speed, Segar</HI> and
<HI>Selden</HI> in one Place, so that in <HI>Froissart,</HI> however the

<P>THIS Work contains not an entire Version of two or three Books
only of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Aeneid,</HI> as some might imagine from the
slender Bulk of the Book; nor is it here translated into Verse, as they
might also expect, in imita∣tion of the Original, and as nothing appears to
the contrary in the Title above, printed at the End: but it is rather a
Reduction of that <HI>Epic Poem</HI> to an <HI>historical</HI> Narrative in
<HI>Prose;</HI> which, tho' a commendable Undertaking at that time, to
familiarize the Contents; yet, as it is but a Trans∣lation of a
Translation; as the Original itself is familiar e∣nough now, and we have
also many better Translations, even in Verse, directly from it; the very
Table of Heads, no less than sixty-five, cannot be in this Place
desirable Therefore, we shall only refer to a Note at Bottom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And first, of the <HI>French Author</HI>; who as he begins his
Work so high as the Building of <HI>Troy</HI> by <HI>Priamus,</HI> so he
con∣tinues it beyond the Slaughter of <HI>Turnus</HI> by <HI>Aeneas,</HI> to
the Suc∣cession of his Son <HI>Ascanius,</HI> and two or three
Sucessions beyond. Moreover, towards the beginning of his Work, that is, in
<HI>Chapter</HI> 6, he has a Digression upon <HI>Bocace,</HI> for relating
the Story of <HI>Dido</HI> in his <HI>Fall of Princes,</HI> differently from
<HI>Virgil,</HI> and recites his Account as well as that of his Author. And in
<HI>Cap.</HI> 33. he passes over <HI>Aeneas</HI> his Descent into Hell,
<HI>because 'tis feign'd, and not to be believed</HI>; as if several other
Parts of this Story, which he has repeated, were not as incredible as that. But
to pass to the Translator and <HI>Printer,</HI> we observe his Style to
be more <HI>ornate</HI> (as he calls it) or dress'd up in superfine Words,
especially of the <HI>French</HI> Extract, than we believe it would have
been, had he not submitted it to the Correction. It is more regularly printed
than that former of his, described in our last Number; as not running out,
but having the Lines all even at the Ends; and large <HI>Initials</HI> at the
beginning of every Chapter: It has also <HI>Signatures</HI> at the Bottom of
the Pages, and besides Commas and Periods, Colons and Semicolons, or what
might be designed as such, tho' not always placed perhaps to an∣swer the
Purpose of them.</NOTE>, for <PB N="128" REF="155"/> a few Remarks upon the
Work itself; and here recite the Translator's <HI>Preface</HI>; which
contains such observable Proofs of the fleeting Fashions in our
<HI>English</HI> Tongue, as may mo∣derate the Conceits of those who depend
upon a Style, or Manner of Expression, more than the Matter expressed,
that will not, like most other things, become obsolete, but maintain its
Perspicuity, and engage the Taste of all Ages.</P>
<P>This <HI>Preface,</HI> containing near two Leaves, is as follows: 
<Q REND="inline">"After dyverse Werkes made, translated and
achieved, hav∣ing noo Werke in hande; I, sittyng in my Studye, where∣as laye
many dyverse Paunflettis and Bookys, happened that to my Hande cam a lytyl
Booke in <HI>Frenshe,</HI> which late was translated out of <HI>Latyn</HI>
by some Noble Clerke of <HI>Fraunce</HI>; whiche Booke is named
<HI>Eneydos,</HI> made in <HI>Latyn</HI> by that noble Poete and grete Clerke
<HI>Vyrgyle.</HI> Which Booke I sawe over and redde therein; how after the
generall Destruccyon of the grete <HI>Troye, Eneas</HI> departed, beryng his
olde Fader <HI>Anchises</HI> upon his Sholdres, his lityl Son <HI>Yolus</HI>
on his Honde; his Wyfe wyth moche other People followynge; and how he shypped
and departed, wyth alle th Hystorye of his Adventures, that he had 'er he cam
to the Achievement of his Conquest of <HI>Ytalye,</HI> as all a longe shall
be shewed in this present Boke. In which Booke I had grete Playsyr, by
cause of the fayr and honest Terms and Wordes in <HI>Frenshe;</HI> which
I never sawe to fore lyke, ne none so playsaunt, ne so wel ordred.
Which Booke, as me semed, sholde be moche requysite to Noble Men to
see, as wel for the Eloquence, as the Hystoryes, how wel that many honderd
Yerys passed was the sayd Booke of <HI>Eneydos</HI> with other Werkes
made and learned dayly in Scolis, specyally in <HI>Ytalye</HI> and other
Places. Whiche Historye the sayd <HI>Vyrgyle</HI> made in Metre. And whan I
had advised me in this sayd Booke, I delybered and concluded to translate
it into <HI>Englyshe,</HI> and forthwyth toke a Pen and Ynke and wrote a Leef
or tweyne, which I oversawe agayn to corecte it: and whan I sawe the fayr
and straunge Termes therein, I doubted that it sholde not please some
Gentylmen, whiche <PB N="129" REF="156"/> late blamed me, saying, that in my
Translacyons I had over curyous Termes which coude not be understande of
comyn Peple, and desired me to use olde and homely Termes in my
Translacyons, and fayn wolde I satysfye every Man. And so to doo toke an
olde Boke and redde therein, and certaynly the <HI>Englysshe</HI> was so
rude and brood, that I coude not well understande it. And also my Lord
Abbot of <HI>Westmynster</HI> ded do shewe to me of late certayn
Evydences wryton in old <HI>Englisshe,</HI> for to reduce it into our
<HI>Englysshe</HI> now usid; and certaynly it was wreton in such wyse,
that it was more lyke to <HI>Dutche</HI> than <HI>Englysshe</HI>; I coude not
reduce ne brynge it to be understonden. And certaynly our Langage now used
varyeth ferre from that which was used and spoken whan I was born; for we
<HI>Englyssh</HI> Men ben borne un∣der the Domynacyon of the <HI>Mone,</HI>
which is never sted∣faste, but ever waverynge, wexyng one Season, and
waneth and dyscreaseth another Season; and that comyne
<HI>Englysshe</HI> that is spoken in one Shyre varyeth from another. In
so muche, that in my dayes happened that certayn Merchauntes were in a Shipp
in <HI>Tamyse,</HI> for to have sayled over the See into <HI>Zelande</HI>;
and for lacke of Wynde they taryed atte <HI>Forlond,</HI> and went to lande for
to refreshe them; and one of them named <HI>Sheffelde,</HI> a Mercer, came
into an Hows, and axed for Mete, and specyally <HI>he axed for Eggs,</HI> and
the goode Wyf answerde, that <HI>she coude speke no Frenshe</HI>; and
the Marchaunt was angry, for he also coude speke no <HI>Frenshe,</HI> but
wolde have hadde Egges, and she understode hym not. And thenne at laste
another sayd, That <HI>he wolde have Eyren</HI>; then the good Wyf sayd,
that she understod him wel. Loo what sholde a Man in thyse Days wryte,
<HI>Egges</HI> or <HI>Eyren?</HI> Cer∣taynly it is harde to playse every Man,
by cause of Dy∣versite and Chaunge of Langage. For in these Days every
Man, that is in ony Reputacyon in his Countre, will utter his Communicacyon and
Matters in such Man∣ners and Termes, that fewe Men shall understonde
them; and som honest and grete Clerkes have ben wyth me, and desired me
to wryte the moste curyous Termes that I coude fynde. And thus bytween playn,
rude, and cu∣rious, I stand abasshed. But in my Judgemente, the comyn
Termes that be dayli used ben lyghter to be un∣derstonde than the old
auncyent <HI>Englysshe.</HI> And for as moche as this present Booke is not
for a rude uplondyssh <PB N="130" REF="157"/> Man to laboure therin, ne rede
it, but only a Clerk and a noble Gentleman, that feleth and understondeth in
Fayles of Armes, in Love, and in noble Chyvalry; ther∣for in meane bytwene
bothe, I have reduced and transla∣ted this sayd Booke into our
<HI>Englisshe,</HI> not over rude, ne curyous; but in such Termes as
shall be understanden by Goddys Grace accordyng to my Copye. And yf ony Man
wyll entermete in redyng of hit, and fyndeth suche Termes that he cannot
understande, late hym goo rede and lerne <HI>Vyrgyll,</HI> or the Pystles
of <HI>Ovyde,</HI> and ther he shall see and understande lightly all, yf
he have a good Redar and Enformer; for this Booke is not for every rude and
unconnynge Man to see, but Clerkys and very Gen∣tylmen that understands
Gentylnes and Scyence. Then I praye alle theym that shall rede in this lytyl
Treatys to holde me for excused for the translatynge of hit: For I
knowleche myselfe ignorant of connynge to enpryse on me so hie and noble
a Werke. But I praye Mayster <HI>John Skelton,</HI> late created <HI>Poete
Laureate</HI> in the Unyversite of <HI>Oxenforde,</HI> to oversee and
correcte this sayd Booke; and taddresse and expowne where as shall be
founde faulte to theym that shall requyre it: For hym I knowe for
suffy∣cyent to expowne and <HI>Englysshe</HI> every Dyfficulte that is
therein: For he hath late translated the <HI>Epystles</HI> of
<HI>Tulle,</HI> and the Booke of <HI>Dyodorus Syculus,</HI> and diverse other
Werkes oute of <HI>Latyn</HI> into <HI>Englisshe,</HI> not in rude and olde
Langage, but in polysshed and ornate Termes craftely; as he that hath redde
<HI>Vyrgyle, Ovyde, Tullye,</HI> and all the other noble Poetes and Oratours,
to me unknowen: And also he hath redde the IX Muses, and understands
their musicalle Scyences, and to whom of them eche Scyence is appropred: I
suppose he hath dronken of <HI>Elycon</HI>'s Well. Then I praye hym, and
such other, to correcte, adde, or mynysshe, whereas he, or they, shall
fynde faulte; for I have but folowed my Copye in <HI>Frensshe,</HI> as nygh
as me is possible. And yf ony Worde be sayd therin well, I am glad; and
yf otherwyse, I sub∣mytte my said Boke to theyr Correctyon: which Boke I
presente unto the hye born my tocomynge Naturell and Soverayne Lord
<HI>Arthur,</HI> by the Grace of God Prynce of <HI>Walys</HI> Duc of
<HI>Cornewayll</HI> and Erle of <HI>Chester,</HI> fyrst begoten Sone and

for his prosperous encreasyng in Vertue, Wysdom, and Humanyte, that he
may be egal with the most renouned of alle his noble Progenytours; and so

<P>THO' there is no Date in the <HI>Title Page</HI> of this
History, we have ventured to add the same that appears at the End of the
<HI>Dedication,</HI> which is made thereof to <HI>the Right Worshipful Sir
Philip Sidney,</HI> by the said Dr. <HI>Powel.</HI> Herein, this Editor,
instead of extolling the noble Gifts and Vertues in his said Patron, which
were conspicuous to all Men, exhorts him to the diligent Exercise of them;
and particu∣larly, from those domestick Examples, his noble
<HI>Father,</HI> constantly inclined more to benefit even <HI>Wales</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> besides his own Country, than himself; and his honourable
Father-in-Law, Sir <HI>Francis Walsingham,</HI> the Queen's Chief Secretary;
whose Zeal for God's Glory, and Love of those who feared him unfeignedly,
was well known to the World. 
<Q REND="inline">"Follow, says he, their Footsteps, with the
Remembrance of that noble House out of which you are descended by your
honourable Mother; and then you cannot do a∣miss. Labour, by the Example of
your Father, <HI>to dis∣cover, and bring to light, the Acts of the famous Men
of elder Times,</HI> who, with Conference of the State and Go∣vernment of all
Ages, will bring you to the perfect <HI>Ex∣perience</HI> <PB N="132" REF="159"/>
of those things that you have learned out of <HI>Aris∣totle, Plato,</HI>
and <HI>Cicero,</HI> by your Travel in Philosophy. Your Father, with his
great Expences and Labour, hav∣ing procured and gotten to his hands the
<HI>Histories of Wales and Ireland</HI> (which Countries for many Years with
great Love and Commendation he govern'd) committed unto me <HI>this of
Wales,</HI> to be set forth in Print, with Direction to proceed therein, and
necessary Books for the doing thereof. And altho' I was unsufficient for
doing of it, yet I have done mine Endeavour; and now do present the same
unto your Worship, as by good Reason due to the Son and Heir of Him that
was the Procurer and Bringer of it to light," <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From the Editor's <HI>Epistle to the Reader,</HI> his
<HI>Notes</HI> on the <HI>History,</HI> and the Beginning thereof itself,
we learn, That this <HI>Succession of the British Princes</HI> was the
Work of <HI>Carodoc</HI> of <HI>Lancarvan,</HI> from the Reign of
<HI>Cadwalader,</HI> the last <HI>British</HI> Monarch, over the <HI>whole
Island,</HI> (who fled into <HI>Armorica,</HI> or <HI>Bretagne,</HI> Anno
680, and died at <HI>Rome</HI> eight Years after, with whose Departure to
that Part of <HI>France,</HI> and a List of the <HI>British</HI> Kings
ruling there, this <HI>History</HI> begins) down to some Years of <HI>Owen
Gwyneth</HI>'s Reign over that <HI>Part of the Island,</HI> now called
<HI>Wales</HI>; that is to the Year 1157, or the 3d of <HI>Henry</HI> II. King
of <HI>England,</HI> as may be seen, <HI>p.</HI> 206. The
<HI>Continuation</HI> which follows for 113 Years, from that time, was yearly
register'd in the Abbeys of <HI>Con∣way</HI> and <HI>Stratflur,</HI> down to
the Year 1270; or the 54th of our <HI>Henry</HI> III. which was a little before
the Death of the last <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>; and here ends this <HI>British
Chronicle;</HI> as ap∣pears <HI>p.</HI> 327. Many Copies remained of it, at
this time, in <HI>Wales;</HI> most of them 200 Years old; and one of them
coming to the hands of Mr. <HI>Humphrey Lhoyd,</HI> a learned and skillful
Antiquary, he translated it into clear smooth <HI>English,</HI> and
continued it chiefly out of <HI>Matt. Paris,</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Trivet,</HI>
to the Slaughter of the said Prince <HI>Lhew∣elyn,</HI> the last of
<HI>British</HI> Blood who had the Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> in 1282; or
the tenth of our <HI>Edward</HI> I. that is, to <HI>page</HI> 375 of this
Volume. But before this Translation and Continuation were thoroughly
polished by the said <HI>H. Lhoyd,</HI> he was taken away by Death, in the
Flower of his Time. Yet the Copy of his Labour being procured, and preserved
by Sir <HI>Henry Sidney,</HI> Lord President of <HI>Wales,</HI> he prefer'd
our Editor, Dr. <HI>Powel,</HI> to the Care of its Publication; who, procuring
all the printed Histories which treated of <HI>Wales,</HI> 
<PB N="133" REF="160"/> and the Use of all <HI>John Stow</HI>'s MS.
Histories, and many Books of <HI>British</HI> Pedegrees from the Lord
<HI>Burghley,</HI> with his Authority for searching all the <HI>Records</HI>;
did not only correct the said Translation, but put marginal References in
it to those Historians who treated of the particular Facts, and additional
Notes, likewise throughout of Matters relating to <HI>Wales</HI> in those
Historians, unmentioned in his Copy; also interspersed the same with
many authentic In∣struments, Records and Pedigrees; and lastly made a
fur∣ther Continuation <HI>Of the Princes of Wales of the Blood Royal of
England,</HI> and the <HI>Lords President,</HI> down to his own Time; the
whole ending with the aforesaid Sir <HI>Henry Sidney</HI> at <HI>page</HI>
401. So that Authors have been too indi∣stinct, when they have quoted every
Part of this Book un∣der one Name. Thus much for the general View; now to be a
little more particular.</P>
<P>After the Editor's Epistle before mentioned, follows a
<HI>Description of Cambria, now called Wales: Drawn first by</HI> Sir
<HI>John Prise,</HI> and <HI>afterwards augmented by H. Lhoyd;</HI> and here
prefixed for the better understanding of this Hi∣story. Herein, upon the
Name of <HI>Wallia,</HI> there is Occasion taken by the said
<HI>Lhoyd,</HI> it seems, to make a liberal Cen∣sure of <HI>Polydore
Virgil,</HI> being a Stranger, as well to many of our Histories, as the
Tongues they are written in, and a Reference made to the <HI>Apology</HI> of
Sir <HI>John Prise,</HI> and the <HI>British</HI> History he purposely
writ against the envious Reports and slaunderous Taunts of the said
<HI>Polydore</HI>; whose Errors in great number are there confuted. And it is
fur∣ther shewn, that <HI>Wales</HI> is a new and strange Name, which the
<HI>Britains</HI> do not understand; that they know no other than
<HI>Cambry,</HI> nor of their Language than <HI>Cambraec,</HI> or the
<HI>Cambers</HI> Tongue; That they know not what <HI>England</HI> or
<HI>English</HI> means, but call the Country <HI>Lhoyger</HI> (from
<HI>Locrine</HI>) the <HI>Englishmen, Sayson</HI>; and their Tongue
<HI>Saysonaec</HI>; which is a Token this is the old <HI>British</HI>
Language: For the Works of <HI>Merdhyn</HI> and of <HI>Taliessin,</HI> who
wrote above 1000 Years past, are almost the same Words as they use at
this Day, or at least understood by all who know the <HI>Welsh
Tongue.</HI> Then he discourses of the Three Remnants of the
<HI>Britains,</HI> in <HI>Wales, Cornwal,</HI> and little <HI>Britain,</HI> or
<HI>Bre∣tagne</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> The Bounds of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the
Division thereof, into <HI>Three</HI> Territories, that is, <HI>North-Wales,
South-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Powys-Land</HI>; subdivided into their several 
<PB N="134" REF="161"/> <HI>Candreds,</HI> and <HI>Comots</HI>; and all
express'd in their old <HI>British</HI> Names.</P>
<P>Thus we come to the History, which has a little wooden
<HI>Print</HI> at the Head of every Chapter or Prince's Reign, more for
Ornament, we presume, than real Resemblance; because they are
discontinued at the <HI>English</HI> Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> of whom
some true Representation was more likely to be recovered. The History is
too short to be made shorter, by any thing that looks like an Epitomy;
besides, it cannot prudently be desired, we should be so long confined
from the Description of other Books, as to give an Abstract of every
Prince's Reign in this. It may be therefore suffi∣cient, that we here draw
out a <HI>Table</HI> of their <HI>Names,</HI> with a Chronology of their
<HI>Deaths,</HI> and the Names of those Princes, who were their
<HI>Contemporaries</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> which will be of general Use in
Reading any other Piece of <HI>Welsh</HI> History.</P>

as much to the Glory of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, as any Book that ever

neglecting to <HI>translate</HI> it into the Universal Language, or at
least to <HI>republish</HI> it in a fair Impression, with proper
Illus∣trations, and especially an <HI>Index,</HI> wherewith the Author
him∣self supply'd the first Edition, printed in one Volume,
<HI>Folio,</HI> 1589; we shall not here repeat those Complaints; because
we must necessarily wait for the Return of that Spirit, which ani∣mated
the gallant Adventurers recorded therein to so many heroic Exploits, before
we can expect such a true Taste of Delight will prevail to do them so
much Justice; or that <HI>Envy</HI> of tran∣scendent Worth, will permit a
noble <HI>Emulation</HI> of it so far to per∣petuate the Renown of our said
Ancestors, as to render, by this means, their Memory no less durable and
extensive, than their Merits have demanded. For it may, perhaps, be thought
im∣politic, thus to display the most hazardous and the most generous
Enterprises which appear in this Book, for the Honour and Advantage of our
Country, till the Vertues of our <HI>Predecessors</HI> will not reflect
disadvantageous Comparisons upon the <HI>Posterity</HI> who shall
revive them. But there may be still room left for a more favourable
Construction of such Neglect, and to hope that no∣thing but the casual
Scarcity or Obscurity of a Work, so long since out of Print, may have
prevented its falling into those able and happy Hands, as might, by such an
Edition, reward the eminent <HI>Examples</HI> preserved therein, the

useful to many of our Authors, not only in <HI>Cosmography</HI> and
<HI>Navigation,</HI> but in <HI>History,</HI> especi∣ally that of the
glorious Reign in which so many brave Exploits were atchieved: As it has been
such a <HI>leading Star</HI> to the <HI>Naval Histories</HI> since
compiled; and saved from the Wreck of Oblivion many exemplary Incidents in

unworthily omitted in the <HI>Eng∣lish Historical Library.</HI> And
<HI>lastly,</HI> Tho' the first Volume of this <HI>Collection</HI> does
frequently appear, by the Date, in the Title Page, to be printed in 1599. the
Reader is not thence to conclude the said Volume was then reprinted, but only
the Title Page, as upon collating the Books we have observed; and fur∣ther,
that in the said last printed Title Page, there is no men∣tion made of the
<HI>Cadiz</HI> Voyage; to omit which, might be one Reason of reprinting that
Page: For it being one of the most prosperous and honourable Enterprizes
that ever the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was ingaged in, and he falling into
the Queen's unpar∣donable Displeasure at this time, our Author, Mr.
<HI>Hakluyt,</HI> might probably receive Command or Direction, even from one of
the Patrons to whom these Voyages are dedicated, who was of the contrary
Faction, not only to suppress all Memorial of that Action in the Front of
this Book, but even cancel the whole <HI>Narrative</HI> thereof at the
<HI>End</HI> of it, in all the Copies (far the greatest Part of the
Impression) which remained unpub∣lished. And in that castrated Manner
the Volume has descended to Posterity; not but if the Castration was
intended to have been concealed from us, the last Leaf of the Preface would
have been reprinted also, with the like Omission of what is there
mentioned concerning the Insertion of this Voyage. But at last, about the
middle of the late King's Reign, an uncastrated Copy did arise, and the
said Voyage was reprinted from it; whereby many imperfect Books have been
made complete.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>XXVI. 
<BIBL>Enquiries <HI>touching the</HI> DIVERSITY <HI>of</HI>
LANGUAGES <HI>and</HI> RELIGIONS, <HI>through the chief Parts of the World.
Writ∣ten by</HI> EDW. BREREWOOD, <HI>lately Professor of</HI> Astronomy
<HI>in</HI> GRESHAM COLLEGE <HI>in</HI> LONDON. <HI>Printed by</HI> John Bill,
4to. 1622. Pages 203, besides Dedication, Preface,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS learned Treatise, being published after the Au∣thor's
Death, is <HI>dedicated</HI> to the Archbishop of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> by
<HI>Robert Brerewood,</HI> who, as it is thought, did also compose the
<HI>Preface</HI> to the Reader, shewing the <HI>Oc∣casions</HI> the Author
had to write the ensuing <HI>Discourse;</HI> and briefly describing the
general State of <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> for a Supply to the
said Work.</P>
<P>It is divided into <HI>Twenty-seven Chapters</HI>; and treats,
<HI>first, Of the antient Largeness</HI> or Extent <HI>of the</HI> Greek
<HI>Tongue,</HI> and the Causes thereof, with its Declension, upon the
Inundation of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> about 640 Years after our Saviour, in the
Time of <HI>Heraclius</HI> the Emperor. 2. More particularly <HI>of the Decay
of the antient pure Greek,</HI> and of the present vulgar <HI>Greek</HI>;
nevertheless that the present Language does not so much decline from the
ancient <HI>Greek,</HI> as the <HI>Italian</HI> departs from the
<HI>Latin,</HI> according to <HI>Bello∣nius:</HI> for that there were
Corruptions, even in the ancient <HI>Greek</HI>; however, it is concluded, that
the Skilful in the learned <HI>Greek</HI> cannot understand the
<HI>vulgar.</HI> 3. <HI>Of the Extent of the Roman Tongue in the time of the
Roman Empire,</HI> with the Causes of its spreading, and in what Parts of
the Em∣pire it was most spoken: That it was little respected in the
<HI>Eastern</HI> Parts thereof, and why. 4. <HI>That the Roman Tongue
abolished not the vulgar Languages in the foreign Provinces of the Roman
Empire,</HI> but that near fourteen Tongues here mention'd (in which Number the
<HI>English, Italian, Spanish,</HI> <PB N="160" REF="187"/> and
<HI>French,</HI> are not reckoned, our Author instancing only Original or
Mother Languages) were in <HI>Europe</HI> in the Time of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Empire, and six or seven of them within the Limits of it. From hence it is
observed, how hard it is to sup∣plant vulgar Languages in populous
Countries: That neither the <HI>Punic,</HI> nor the <HI>Gallic,</HI> the
<HI>Spanish,</HI> or <HI>Pannonian</HI> Tongue was abolished by the
<HI>Romans</HI>; and that the <HI>Latin</HI> was nei∣ther generally nor
perfectly spoken in the <HI>Provinces.</HI> 5. <HI>Of the beginning of the
Italian, French, and Spanish Languages</HI>; with the Ruin of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Empire, when, and by whom; and that Barbarous Nations were not
the first Authors of those degenerate Languages, but rather Promoters of
their Corruptions. 6. <HI>Objections touching the Extent of the Latin Tongue
answered;</HI> That it was never purely spoken in the foreign Provinces;
that there were great Changes in it; whereof, he concludes with a pregnant
Example from the Inscription upon that naval Column (they call it
<HI>Columnam Rostratam,</HI> being deck'd with the Beaks of Ships) in the
Capitol at <HI>Rome</HI>; which Inscription, tho' composed not above 150
Years before the Tongue shone in its full Lustre under <HI>Cicero,</HI> has
not one Word in it spell'd like the later <HI>Latin</HI> that is subjoined:
An Example which may give the <HI>English</HI> Tongue some Countenance,
tho' our Author does men∣tion an Instance or two also of its Mutability,
since it is in a far larger Compass of Years. 7. <HI>Of the Ancient
Languages of Italy, Spain, France, and Africa:</HI> That the <HI>Punics</HI> of
<HI>Afri∣ca</HI> were originally <HI>Canaanites</HI> or <HI>Phoenicians,</HI>
and that the <HI>Punic</HI> Language was the old <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue; and
tho' that <HI>Punic</HI> Speech in <HI>Plautus,</HI> which is the only Specimen
of it extant, hath no great Affinity with the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> yet 'tis
im∣puted to the Corruptions of Transcription. 8. <HI>Of the great Extent of
the Slavonic, Turkish, and Arabic Tongues.</HI> 9. <HI>Of the Syriac and
Hebrew Tongues</HI>; the Beginning and Change of the <HI>Syriac</HI>; the
Difference of <HI>Hebrew</HI> from <HI>Chal∣dee</HI> and <HI>Syriac</HI>; the
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Chaldee</HI> Translations read in the Synagogues. 10.
<HI>Of the sundry Parts of the World in∣habited by Christians</HI>; that
<HI>Christians</HI> were mingled with <HI>Mahometans</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI>;
the weak State of <HI>Christianity</HI> in <HI>A∣frica</HI>; the Dimensions
of the Kingdom of <HI>Abessia</HI>; the State of Christianity in
<HI>Asia,</HI> its Regions and Islands; and its Declension in the
<HI>East Parts</HI> thereof; with the Condi∣tion of Christianity in
<HI>America.</HI> 11. <HI>Of the Parts of the World possessed by
Mahumetans;</HI> the large Extent of <HI>Mahumetism</HI> in <HI>Africa</HI>
and in <HI>Asia</HI>; and why so mightily en∣creased. 
<PB N="161" REF="188"/> 12. <HI>Of the sundry Regions in the World inhabited
by Idolaters</HI>; what Part of <HI>Africa</HI> possessed by them, and
what Parts of <HI>Asia</HI>; their vast Extent in <HI>America.</HI> 13.
<HI>Of the Jews dispersed in several Parts of the World;</HI> the State
of them in <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa. Tartars</HI> suspected
to be of the <HI>Israelites</HI> Race: That <HI>Americans</HI> are the
Progeny of the <HI>Tartars</HI>: That many Nations are circumcised besides
the <HI>Israelites,</HI> and therefore that Circumcision is no sure Token
of Descent from them: That the <HI>Tartarians</HI> are not the Offspring of
the <HI>Israelites:</HI> That the second Book of <HI>Es∣dras</HI>
contradicts the Scripture: That the <HI>Israelites</HI> departed not out of
the Dominion of <HI>Assyria</HI>: that <HI>Arsareth</HI> was a feigned
Mansion of the <HI>Israelites</HI>; and that their Voyage and remote
Retirement favours of the same <HI>Talmudisal</HI> Spirit with that other
Tale of the reason why God ap∣pointed the Sea for the <HI>Whale,</HI> and the
Land for the <HI>Ele∣phant,</HI> because they were too big to be Inhabitants
together in either of those Elements; whereupon we have a Digres∣sion
upon the Dimensions of those two Animals; the Deep∣ness of the Sea, and
Height of Mountains; that the Sea is not higher than the Land, and the Depth of
the Sea more than the Height of the Mountains; the great Declivity of the Face
of the Land, and great Deepness of the Sea. 14. <HI>Of the Quantity and
Proportion of the Parts of the Earth possessed by the several Sorts
of the above-mentioned Religions</HI>; as, the Proportion of
<HI>Christians</HI> to <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Idolaters</HI>; the vast
greatness of the <HI>South</HI> Continent, and of the <HI>Antartic</HI>
Continent. 15. <HI>Of the divers Sorts or Sects of Christians in the World,
and of their several Regions: And first of the Grecians:</HI> The large
Jurisdiction of the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and by what Means
encreased; the Properties of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion. 16. Of the
<HI>Assy∣rians</HI> or <HI>Melchites</HI>; their Religion differs not from
the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI>; the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch</HI>'s Jurisdiction
distracted. 17. <HI>Of the Georgians, Circassians and Mengrellians,</HI>
with their Religion. 18. <HI>Of the Muscovites,</HI> and the Properties or
Principles of their Religion. 19. <HI>Of the Nestorians,</HI> and how far
spread in the Orient; their Patriarch seated in <HI>Musal;</HI> the
Properties or Principles of their Religion. 20. <HI>Of the Indians or
Christians of St. Thomas,</HI> and their Habitation; that they were
<HI>Nestorians,</HI> and became of the <HI>Roman</HI> Reli∣gion; Properties
of the ancient <HI>Indian</HI> Religion; and that the New Testament in
<HI>Syriac</HI> is no ancient Translation. 21. <HI>Of the Jacobites;</HI> the
Antiquity and Seat of their Pa∣triarch; <PB N="162" REF="189"/> Properties of
their Religion. 22. <HI>Of the Cophti, or Christians of Egypt</HI>; infected
by the Heresies of <HI>Eutyches,</HI> and how much
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ooted there: The great
Jurisdiction of the Patriarchs of <HI>Alexandria</HI> and
<HI>Jerusalem.</HI> 23. <HI>Of the Abassines</HI>; and the Dependance of
their Church on <HI>Alex∣andria:</HI> Properties of their Religion, and that
Circumcision is a national Property among them. 24. <HI>Of the
Armenians;</HI> and that their Church is governed by two Patriarchs; their
Jurisdiction, and the Properties of their Religion. 25. <HI>Of the
Maronites,</HI> and their Habitation in <HI>Libanus</HI>; the Resi∣dence and
Jurisdiction of their Patriarch; the Articles of their present and ancient
Religion; the beginning and spreading of <HI>Eutychianism;</HI> the
pestilent Train of <HI>Eutyches</HI> his Heresy, the Oriental Sects
reclaimed from their Errors touching Christ. 26. <HI>Of the several
Languages wherein the Liturgies of Christians, in several Parts of the
World, are celebrated:</HI> The Jews Prayers in <HI>Hebrew; Mahumetans</HI> in
<HI>Arabic</HI>; the Christian Liturgy anciently in <HI>Syriac;
Arme∣nian</HI> Liturgy in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Tongue; the
<HI>Abassines</HI> and <HI>Muscovites</HI> Liturgy in their own Language;
the <HI>Slavonian</HI> Liturgies in the <HI>Slavonic;</HI> that the Scriptures
were translated into vulgar Tongues by the Fathers; the original Litur∣gies
in the <HI>Syriac;</HI> also those of the <HI>Nestorians,</HI> the
<HI>Indians, Jacobites, Aegyptians,</HI> and <HI>Maronites;</HI> the
<HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Syrian</HI> Liturgies in <HI>Greek;</HI> also
those of the <HI>Georgians</HI> and <HI>Circassians.</HI> Lastly,

<P>THIS curious Book, containing the Author's
<HI>Observa∣tions</HI> on the Treatment and Contests of <HI>foreign
Ambas∣sadors</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> from the Year 1612, to the Year
1627, inclusive, was published after the Author's Death, from the
Manuscript by his intimate Acquaintance, Mr. <HI>James Howell.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor, in his Dedication to <HI>Philip</HI> Lord Viscount
<HI>Lisle,</HI> gives this Account of the Author: 
<Q REND="inline">"Among other Parts of Industry, which were known
to be in that worthy Knight, one was, to couch in Writing and keep an ex∣act
<HI>Diary</HI> of what things had passed in his Province, as <HI>Master
of the Ceremonies.</HI>"</Q> And he observes, that 
<Q REND="inline">"No∣thing is taken here upon Trust, but all upon
the Author's own Knowledge, being still upon the Place himself, and an
Actor in everything<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may further add, The Author was,
by King <HI>James</HI> I. a∣bout the Middle of his Reign, made Assistant
to Sir <HI>Lewis Lewkner, Master of the Ceremonies,</HI> in which Service he
acquitted himself with great Honour and Fidelity: whereupon King
<HI>Charles,</HI> after his Father's Death, not only continued him in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Place, but gave him a reversionary
Grant of the Office of <HI>Master of the Ceremo∣nies</HI>; which came to his
Possession by the Death of Sir <HI>Lewis,</HI> 10th of <HI>March</HI>
1626. During his whole Service, he applied himself with great Assiduity;
retiring only when Occasion would serve, to his Country-house at
<HI>Twittenham.</HI> It was his constant Maxim to give the least Occasion
to, and avoid as much as possi∣ble, the too nice Punctillios of
<HI>Procedence</HI> between Ambassadors; which seldom fail to breed
Animosities in their Sovereigns: And, by this means, he was not only much
esteemed by the Ambassadors, which turned greatly to his Advantage, with
regard to their usual Presents; but he likewise prevented the Trouble
that wou'd have ensued to his Majesty, of hearing their frivolous
Complaints. As to this Work, it was the Au∣thor's Method, as appears by the
Editor's <HI>Dedication,</HI> to couch in Writing, what things passed in
his Province, not only for his own, but for the Information of others; and his
Notes were more than once, as appears by his own Words, produced to the Lord
<HI>Chamberlain</HI> to regulate by Precedents the Differences which happened
between Ambassadors: And in one of his Ob∣servations, <HI>page</HI> 129.
he says he does it, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>for future Occasions and Use to the
Master of the Ceremonies</HI>;"</Q> which plainly shews his Intention,
<HI>that these Observations</HI> shou'd be made publick; and to every one
in that Province, they may, no doubt, be of great Use and Instruction. And
they may be of further and still greater Use, as well in illustrating
some Parts of Mons. <HI>Wiquefort,</HI> as the <HI>English</HI> History
in that Period, well known to have so much abounded in Embassies, and in
the Particulars whereof our Hi∣storians of those Times are very deficient,
not having had the Light of these Observations. <HI>Anthony Wood,</HI> who
informs us, that he lived to the Age of 70 Years, and died in 1641, yet gives
us no Account how long he remained in his Office, nor why he so abruptly
discontinued his Observations. But we have heard there now is an original
or authentick MS. of them in being, which might give further Intelligence in
this Particular.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="191"/>The Work itself consists of two Parts,
and is continued in a <HI>chronological</HI> Method.</P>
<P>Part I. Containing the Author's Services under K. <HI>James,</HI>
begins with the Arrival of the Count <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> to
marry the Princess <HI>Elizabeth</HI> on the 16th of <HI>Octob.</HI> 1612,
attended by Count <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Nassau,</HI> and eight other

Arch-Duke's Ambassador, on Precedence given to the <HI>Ve∣netian</HI>
Ambassador at the Marriage; with the King's Apo∣logy in Writing, sent by

Engraving the Heads or Effigies of some of the Chancellors and Judges,
men∣tioned in these Tables; but they are differently bound up, sometimes
before, sometimes after them, and sometimes interspersed in the
Chronology, against the Pages where their Creations are mentioned. These
Heads are those of Sir <HI>John Clench,</HI> etch'd by <HI>Hollar;</HI> Sir
<HI>Edward Coke,</HI> graved by <HI>D. Loggan</HI>; Sir <HI>Randolph Crew,</HI>
and Sir <HI>Robert Heath,</HI> by <HI>Hollar;</HI> the Earl of
<HI>Clarendon,</HI> by <HI>Loggan;</HI> to which Chan∣cellor, the first
Edition of this Book being inscrib'd, his Print is often bound therein, at
the beginning thereof; and fur∣ther, which are not in the first Edition, Sir
<HI>Orlando Bridg∣man,</HI> graved by <HI>Faithorne,</HI> which is in the
second and last Editions; and Sir <HI>John Vaughan,</HI> by <HI>White,</HI>
which is only in this last. So that the last Edition has, with Mr.
<HI>Selden</HI>'s Head before mentioned, three Cuts more than the first: 
<PB N="174" REF="201"/> But those in that, are, as must be expected, of more
lively and perfect Impression. At the End of these <HI>Tables,</HI> we
have, in one Page, a Continuation of the Catalogues of the <HI>Readers</HI> and
<HI>Treasurers</HI> of the <HI>Inner Temple, Middle Temple,
Lincoln's-Inn,</HI> and <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI>; which should have followed at
the end of those Catalogues, in their respective Places, had what
passes for this last Edition been entirely reprinted, but except the
Title-Page at the beginning of the Book, and three Leaves at the end,
continuing the Chro∣nology, and Catalogues aforesaid, 'tis the same with
the second Impression, and they are so much worse than the first,
by how much the <HI>Errata</HI> of the Press in them are more numerous;
however, this last Edition sells in the Shops, sometimes, for as much
again as the first. And this is all we have here to remark of this Book, from
our pre∣sent Review of it, and the Opportunity we have had of collating the
several Editions: What others have observed, we refer to below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of these Editions we shall only add, That the <HI>first</HI>
was published in 1666, that the <HI>historical</HI> Part consists of
332 Pages, and the <HI>Chronology</HI> of 117, when the Figures of the Pages
are rightly corrected, ending at the Year 1665. The <HI>second</HI> Edi∣tion
was printed 1671, has in the <HI>historical</HI> Part, like this last, 336
Pages; and in the <HI>chronological,</HI> 117, ending at the Year 1671.
<HI>Ant. Wood</HI> says, 
<Q REND="inline">"That of the first Impression, many
Co∣pies were burnt by the Fire of <HI>London:</HI>"</Q> And that, 
<Q REND="inline">"in the <HI>Chronica Series</HI> are many
Faults;"</Q> which will not so much be wondered at, by those who have read
how much of it was now first calculated, and in a manner guessed at,
thro' the Defect of Registers, as that, for such a Space of Time, the
Author should be able to settle so many Persons in their respective
Places. Bishop <HI>Nicholson</HI> is of Opinion, 
<Q REND="inline">"That our first Enquiries after the
<HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Laws</HI> of this Kingdom, ought to begin with
the careful reading of <HI>this</HI> Book; which we shall find so
ac∣curately penn'd, and with so good a Mixture of Learning and Judgment, that
it will almost do the Work alone: That he cannot give a better View of this
most elaborate Treatise, than by telling the Reader, it fully answers its
Title-Page; giving as compleat a History, as it was possible for one Man
to furnish us with, of the Particulars therein mentioned: That under all
these Heads, the Collections are many, and the Method exact; so that we
have abundance without Super∣fluity; and all we can wish for, without the
hazard of being cloy'd: That in the <HI>Chronology,</HI> if any thing hath
escaped the Search of so diligent and curious a Writer, the Tables are so
ordered, that every Reader's additional Discoveries are quickly marshall'd
and tribed under their proper Columns: And lastly, That out of these, and
<HI>Rastal</HI>'s <HI>Table</HI> of <HI>Years,</HI> were stoln the

<BIBL><HI>The</HI> NATURAL HISTORY <HI>of</HI> STAFFORDSHIRE:
<HI>By</HI> ROB. PLOT, <HI>LL. D. Keeper of the Ashmolean Musaeum,</HI> and
<HI>Professor</HI> of <HI>Chymistry</HI> in the University of
<HI>Oxford. Fol.</HI> Oxford 1686. Pages 450.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS Work, by the Title, seemingly confined to the remarkable
Productions of <HI>Nature,</HI> only in <HI>one</HI> Coun∣ty; therefore, under
that Consideration alone, particularly engaging to all ingenious
<HI>Natives</HI> thereof, is nevertheless such an extensive Field of
curious and instructive Matter, so various in its kinds, yet connected by
such easy Transi∣tions, and supported by such pertinent Parallels, as
have rendered it of a more general or comprehensive Nature; so as to become
a Pattern, tho' scarcely equal'd, to several <HI>Writers,</HI> who have
attempted the Illustration of other Coun∣ties in the like manner, and may
indeed be coveted by all <HI>Readers,</HI> who delight in <HI>natural</HI>
Knowledge.</P>
<P>It is dedicated by the Author to King <HI>James,</HI> because of
the Approbation his Majesty had shewn to his <HI>History</HI> of
<HI>Oxford</HI>; and after his short <HI>Preface,</HI> we have the
<HI>Verses</HI> of <HI>T. Lane</HI> to the said King <HI>James</HI> II.
upon occasion of the Author's presenting him this Work: Also others to
the Author himself, by Mr. <HI>J. Norris,</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> and
<HI>S. Wel∣sted,</HI> in <HI>Latin.</HI> After this, the Work is faced with a
most ac∣curate <HI>Map</HI> of the County; inscrib'd by the Author to the
Lord Lieutenant thereof, <HI>Charles Talbot,</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI>
It is graved on a large Sheet, folding in, by <HI>Joseph Brown,</HI> having
the <HI>Arms</HI> of all the Gentry in the County display'd about the
Margins, and such mutual <HI>References,</HI> that any Stranger, seeing a
<HI>Seat</HI> in the Map, may most readily find the <HI>Arms</HI> and
<HI>Name</HI> that belong to it; or knowing only the <PB N="176" REF="203"/>
<HI>Name,</HI> shall as quickly find his <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Seat.</HI> Yet
we have the further Convenience, for the less apprehensive Reader, of an
<HI>Explanation</HI> prefixed, and an <HI>alphabetical</HI> List of all the
<HI>Parishes, Villages,</HI> and <HI>Houses</HI> delineated therein.</P>
<P>As to his Method; that which he formerly prescribed himself in
his <HI>Natural History of Oxfordshire,</HI> being approv'd of, he follows
the same here; whereby the whole Work is divided into <HI>Ten Chapters</HI>;
which are interspersed with <HI>thirty-seven</HI> Copper <HI>Prints</HI>
of the chief <HI>Seats</HI> and <HI>Views, Curiosities</HI> of
<HI>Nature,</HI> and <HI>Antiquities</HI> found in the County; each Print
inscribed to the Owners of those Seats, or other eminent Natives of the
said Shire. <HI>Chapter</HI> I. treats of what has been observable among
them <HI>in the Heavens and Air</HI>; as, particularly, the Remark of the
<HI>Moorland</HI> Inhabitants upon the <HI>Sun-set,</HI> in the Summer
Solstice; also the <HI>Mock-Suns</HI> frequent in this County. Remarkable
<HI>Rainbows,</HI> as, of the Moon, and <HI>Halo's</HI> of the Sun. Strange
Effects of <HI>Thunder</HI> and <HI>Lightning</HI>; with an elaborate
Digression upon <HI>Fairy Circles</HI>; which tho' he indulges so far the
Accounts of <HI>Remigius</HI> and others, who impute the <HI>same</HI> to
Wizards and Witches, as to recite them; yet, at last, more pro∣bably imputes
them to Lightning. Then we come to his Re∣marks on Animals, especially on the
mortal Effects of <HI>Thun∣der</HI> upon Crevices and Lobsters. Several
strange <HI>Meteors. Noises</HI> in <HI>the Air.</HI> Extraordinary
<HI>Hail</HI> Storms, and prodi∣gious <HI>Showers,</HI> particularly of Frogs,
Maggots, <HI>&amp;c. Prog∣nosticks</HI> of <HI>Showers</HI> and
<HI>Winds</HI>; of the <HI>Tornado</HI> Wind; and uncommon <HI>Echoes</HI>;
which, with an Experiment upon <HI>Sounds,</HI> and some short
Observations on the <HI>Comet</HI> in 1681, ends this Chapter.</P>
<P>Chap. II. <HI>Of the Waters.</HI> This is introduced with a
<HI>Discourse</HI> of nine Pages upon the <HI>Effects</HI> of <HI>Air</HI>
on human Bodies. And, among many other Observations, some on Unction and
Painting of the Body, to prevent the Depre∣dations thereof, from <HI>Roger
Bacon.</HI> The Choice of healthy Situations, with many Examples; which brings
him to the Consideration of <HI>Waters,</HI> by which the Air is so much
af∣fected. Several Remarks on the pure Streams and <HI>Waters</HI> of
<HI>common Use</HI> in this County, and particularly the refresh∣ing Pool
of <HI>Madely,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Gervase</HI> of <HI>Tilbury.</HI>
In∣stances of Health in the <HI>Moorlands,</HI> from the Age of twelve
Tenants who made up 1000 Years, and four, who made 360 Years. Then speaks of
the more <HI>unusual Waters</HI>; their Discolourations, Prognostications
of Rain and Dearth, <PB N="177" REF="204"/> Noisiness, Inconstancy of
Flowing, and Intermissions; in Examples from <HI>Hobbes</HI> and
<HI>Cotton, Alex. Neckham, Will.</HI> of <HI>Newberry, Sylvester</HI> the
Poet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here we have a Di∣gression upon the Question,
<HI>Whether Springs are supply'd from the Rains, &amp;c. or from the
Sea.</HI> Observations on the Quantity of Water thrown out by perennial
Springs. Sir <HI>Chr. Wren</HI>'s Invention of the Rain-Bucket, to measure
the Quantity that falls. Computations of what the greatest Ri∣vers throw
forth in an Hour, Day, Year. The many Ex∣amples favouring the Origin or Supply
of Springs from subtertaneous Communications. Then proceeds to the
<HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Fountains</HI> of this <HI>County,</HI> which have
yielded any unusual Remarks; some running under ground, and rising again;
some throwing up little Bones; some never freez∣ing; some warmest in
the coldest Weather; some salt, as the <HI>Brine-Pits,</HI> with the
manner of <HI>Salt-work;</HI> some again are <HI>Vitrioline</HI>; some
<HI>Petrifying,</HI> and some <HI>Sulphureous.</HI> Here we are led to the
<HI>Medicinal</HI> Waters; among these, such as are of a <HI>milky
Nature,</HI> and others <HI>aluminous.</HI> Some of Re∣pute for curing the
King's-Evil; some good for the Eyes; and some of noxious Quality, as the
Coal-pit Waters which kill the Fish of those Rivers into which they
fall.</P>
<P>Chap. III. <HI>Of the Earths.</HI> This begins with the Situa∣tion
of the County, Nature, and Fertility of the Soil. K. <HI>James</HI> his
saying of it for the Firmness of the Highways. A Remark upon some
Pastures, which tinged the Teeth of Cattle, of a Golden Colour; and upon
others, which changed the Colour of their Hides. A Pit that never held any
Water when it filled all others. Deductions from Re∣marks upon some
Buildings, tending to prove the Earth will be quite <HI>level.</HI> Of
<HI>Earths</HI> that <HI>vegetate</HI> or grow up, and <HI>Floating
Islands.</HI> Of turfing their moorish Grounds, and the rotten
<HI>Shining</HI> Earth. Here we have many curious Instances of luciferous
Bodies, animate, and inanimate. Their different <HI>Kinds</HI> of
<HI>Earths</HI> and <HI>Clays</HI>; and how the <HI>Potters</HI> work the
same. Of their <HI>Earths</HI> used by Painters in <HI>Colours, Sulphurs,
Bitumen,</HI> and <HI>Pit-Coal,</HI> with the Ex∣tent of its <HI>Mines.</HI>
Remarks on their <HI>Damps,</HI> and firing of Mines: Of Earthquakes there,
thought to be caused there∣by. Signs for finding of Coal: Of working it, and
keeping it dry.</P>
<P>Chap. IV. <HI>Of Stones.</HI> The Causes of their Production;
Observations on Salt in Stones, and such as best endure the Fire. Of
<HI>Limestone,</HI> and the <HI>Pyrites</HI>; and the <HI>Bishops
Stones</HI> <PB N="178" REF="205"/> near <HI>Weeford,</HI> why so called. Then
we come to the <HI>Iron</HI> Ore, with the melting and working it; also the
<HI>Copper</HI> Ores, and their Works; then to the <HI>Lead</HI> Ores, where we
have an Account of a Leaden Coffin that swam in nine In∣ches Water, with the
<HI>hydrostatical</HI> Reason for it. Hence we come to the
<HI>Quarries</HI> and their Stones for Building, Grinding, and the Mills; with
an Experiment giving rea∣son to believe the <HI>Loadstone</HI> is to be
found at <HI>Rowley Re∣gis.</HI> Next of the Rocks, Cliffs, and Caves, which
have any thing remarkable; their Alabaster, and the kind of Marble, whereof
their <HI>Chimney-pieces, Tombstones, Emery,</HI> &amp;c. are made. Also of
their <HI>Crowstones,</HI> and transparent <HI>Pebbles.</HI></P>
<P>Chap. V. <HI>Of Formed Stones.</HI> And first of those
resembling heavenly Bodies, as the <HI>Selenites</HI> or
<HI>Moon-stones,</HI> more ra∣tionally called <HI>Lapis Specularis,</HI>
found in this County; and the <HI>Asteriae,</HI> or <HI>Star-Stones,</HI> of
different kind from any yet described, whose unaccountable Quality of
moving towards one another in Vinegar is here observed to have been known 400
Years since, by the learned <HI>Roger Bacon.</HI> He speaks next of the
<HI>Thunder Stones,</HI> as they are commonly called, found in those Parts,
and others representing the Parts of Birds; <HI>Crystalline</HI> Stones; a
kind of <HI>Honeycomb</HI> Stones, full of sweetish Liquor; many Stones
resembling <HI>Sea Fishes,</HI> especially of the <HI>testaceous</HI>
Kind. Of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> grow∣ing like Trees, and other
<HI>Ores</HI> also, into odd Figures. Stones also form'd like particular
Vegetables, as the <HI>Fun∣gites,</HI> likewise <HI>Mineral Corals,</HI> like
Stumps of Trees, and the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of Fishes; like Fruits and the
Stones of them; Animals and their several Parts; Buttons, Barrels, Saddles,
and some Plants found with <HI>Rings</HI> of Stone, Iron, and Cop∣per
naturally growing about them.</P>
<P>Chap. VI. <HI>Of Plants.</HI> Among which, none so remarkable
for resembling certain Parts of the human Body, as the <HI>Fungus
Phalloides,</HI> or <HI>Phallus Hollandicus</HI> of <HI>Hadr. Junius.</HI>
After several uncommon Observations among the <HI>herba∣ccous</HI> Kind, he
advances to some undescribed <HI>Shrubs</HI>; as the <HI>White-Berried
Elder,</HI> Standard <HI>Honey-Suckles,</HI> and <HI>Ivy.</HI> A <HI>Vine</HI>
changing its Fruit from Red to White, St. <HI>Bertram's Ash,</HI> with a
narrower Leaf than usual, a yellow-leav'd <HI>Yew Tree,</HI> a
blood-spotted <HI>Birch,</HI> yellow-leav'd <HI>Thorn</HI>; and among the
Trees unnoted to be of <HI>English</HI> Growth, the <HI>Sorbus
Pyriformis,</HI> and one kind of <HI>Firr:</HI> And among the Accidents of
Trees, some of extraordinary speedy Growth. <PB N="179" REF="206"/>
<HI>Oaks</HI> of vast Bulk and extensive Shade; more particularly Sir
<HI>Harvey Bagot</HI>'s <HI>Witch-Elm,</HI> growing at <HI>Field,</HI> within
Me∣mory; which was 120 Foot long, 17 Yards round at the Bottom, had 14 Load of
Fire-Wood broke off in the Fall, 47 Load more of Fire-Wood cut from the Top,
8000 Foot of <HI>Plank,</HI> 80 Pair of <HI>Naves, &amp;c.</HI> in short
computed to contain 96 Tons of Timber, after their Country way of reckoning;
but, according to our Author, at least 100 Ton of neat Timber. With this is
mentioned, as what might equal it in Height, the Oak which yielded a Plank
above 25 Yards long, and near one Yard broad, of which was made the Table at
<HI>Dudley</HI> Castle. From this we are led to the tall <HI>Firrs</HI> at
<HI>Norbury</HI>; one of which was 47 Yards high; and thence, to what is
observable in the <HI>Roots</HI> of Trees, as their embracing and lifting up
great Stones; Trees of dif∣ferent Species uniting at the Roots, or in the
Trunks, and some Trees growing out of the Bodies and Heads of others; but
above all, those found buried under Ground in all Countries, are reckoned
most unaccountable. Here we have an elaborate Dissertation upon those
<HI>subterraneous Trees,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Moss-wood,</HI> with the
Cause of Mosses, sink∣ing of Hills, and raising of Valleys. Hence we
pass to the in∣ternal Notice of what was most uncommon in Trees; as the
<HI>Cylindraceous</HI> Cavities in an old Crab Tree here described, with the
Cause; leading us to the strange Discovery of Ani∣mals in the Bodies of
Trees, as <HI>Field Mice,</HI> which are su∣perstitiously pegg'd up by
the Country People here, to make <HI>Nursrow</HI> Trees, as they call them,
to cure Swellings in their Cattle; and other Instances of their
Superstition, in the Wood of the <HI>Quicken</HI> Tree, for walking Staves.
Here end∣ing his Remarks on <HI>Whole Trees,</HI> and their <HI>Trunks,</HI>
with an Observation, that the Timber of this County is gene∣rally large and
good, particularly the Woods in the Park of <HI>John Offley,</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whereof 1000 Trees might be chosen worth 8000 Pounds, and
of these 100 worth 1500 Pounds; he proceeds to unusual Accidents in the
<HI>Branches, Fruits,</HI> and <HI>Leaves</HI> of Trees; upon which last he
accounts for the <HI>Excrescences</HI> by Insects, and the
<HI>Variegations</HI> or Stripings in <HI>Hollys, Maples, Ashes,</HI> and
<HI>Oaks</HI> he met with. From thence passes to <HI>Fruit Trees,</HI> as
the large <HI>spreading Apple Tree</HI> at <HI>Leigh,</HI> having borne 50
Strike of Apples in a Year; <HI>Pear Trees</HI> blossoming at
<HI>Christmas</HI>; another that blossom'd and bore twice a Year. The
<HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Lemon</HI> growing on one Tree, and in one Fruit; the
Quantity of <HI>Cyder</HI> <PB N="180" REF="207"/> that might be made in one
Parish; large Cherry Gardens, and great <HI>Variety</HI> of Fruits in the
Gardens of <HI>Rowland Oke∣over,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> as 60 Sorts of Apples,
35 Sorts of Apricots, and other Plums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with which Enumeration
this Chap∣ter ends.</P>
<P>Chap. VII. <HI>Of Brutes.</HI> Under which is comprehended
<HI>Birds, Insects, Fishes, Reptiles</HI> and <HI>Quadrupeds,</HI> and of
these only such as are undescribed by others, unnoted by
<HI>Wil∣lughby</HI> and <HI>Ray</HI> to be <HI>indaginae</HI> of this County,
or have had extraordinary Accidents attending them. And first he be∣gins with
<HI>Birds</HI>; among these he reckons a kind of Goose∣legg'd
<HI>Swans,</HI> and the black-bill'd <HI>Goose,</HI> with a Voice like a
Bittern; an undescribed <HI>Loon</HI> or <HI>Ducker,</HI> crested, horned,
and bearded; the <HI>Eagle,</HI> the <HI>Shriek, Heathcock,</HI> or Black Game,
<HI>Gorcock,</HI> or Red Game, the <HI>Martlet,</HI> Ground <HI>Mar∣tin,
Brambling, Gross-beak, Heron,</HI> and great <HI>Loon:</HI> but most
remarkable is his History of the <HI>Pewits,</HI> and their breeding only
upon the Estate of Sir <HI>Charles Skrymsher,</HI> at the old
<HI>Pewit-Pool</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Norbury,</HI> and
<HI>Shebben-Pool</HI> in the Parish of <HI>High-Offley</HI>; where they
encreased in such abundance, that 50 Dozen has been taken at a Dri∣ving;
which, at five Shillings a Dozen, the ancient Price, comes to twelve Pounds ten
Shillings; but some Years the Profit of them has amounted to fifty or
threescore Pounds: and we have here a Representation, in Sculpture, of
<HI>Shebben-Pool,</HI> with the manner of driving and taking these Birds.
Next he observes what has been extraordinary in the Co∣lours, Limbs, Eggs,
and Time of Production among Birds; as <HI>Popinjays, Crows,</HI> and
<HI>Sparrows</HI> that were white; Cross-bill'd <HI>Ravens</HI>; a
four-legg'd <HI>Pewit,</HI> and three-legg'd <HI>Goose</HI>; with the
Opinions of <HI>Fabricius</HI> and Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> that such Deformities
arise from <HI>double yolked Eggs,</HI> &amp;c. Next we have Observations
upon white yolked <HI>Eggs,</HI> and Eggs all Yolk. Of <HI>Hens</HI> and
<HI>Ducks,</HI> that laid at the rate of three Eggs a Day, and of Birds
hatching in the Winter. Then we come to flying Insects, as the winged
<HI>Glow-worm,</HI> or <HI>Lanthorn-Fly</HI>; the white <HI>Ear-wigg.</HI> Of
<HI>viviparous</HI> Insects, <HI>Spiders,</HI> and their Webs, with some
<HI>aquatic</HI> Insects, unde∣scribed; which leads to <HI>Fishes,</HI>
and his Account of the <HI>Burbot</HI> or <HI>Bird-bolt,</HI> not before, or
not well described. Of Fishes found in unusual Places. Of the uncommon
Nature of <HI>Eels,</HI> that they are <HI>viviparous,</HI> travel from one
Water to another, and the Account of their <HI>equivocal Ge∣neration.</HI> How
various the Food or <HI>Prey</HI> of Fishes; how <PB N="181" REF="208"/>
<HI>voracious</HI> some of them, and others restor'd to their Element after
they had been swallowed up. The unusual <HI>Magnitude</HI> of Fishes,
particularly a <HI>Carp</HI> weighing 15 Pounds, with <HI>Scales</HI> as broad
as a Half-Crown: <HI>Jacks</HI> a Yard and half long. Thus passing from the
Water to the Land Animals, he begins with the <HI>Toad,</HI> and how
strangely some have been found excluded from both Elements in the midst
of solid Blocks of Stone, and in the Bodies of sound Trees. Then we have an
Account of an undescribed Land <HI>Lizard,</HI> a strange toothed
<HI>Rabbit,</HI> uncommon Accidents in a <HI>Hare,</HI> and other Animals
breeding their Young; and an odd Mix∣ture in the Breed of <HI>Dogs.</HI> Of
large <HI>Boars;</HI> the Reason discuss'd why <HI>Castration</HI>
prevents <HI>Horns</HI> in some Animals, and enlarges them in others. Of
uncommon Accidents in Sheep, Deer, Cows, Oxen, Horses, as to Heading,
Breeding, Superfoetation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of <HI>Hair Balls</HI> found in the
Stomachs of such Animals; and <HI>Shining Tallow:</HI> Concluding with a
Description of the true <HI>Hippomanes,</HI> or Forehead Flesh of a new
foaled Colt, so famous among the Ancients in <HI>Philtres</HI> or
<HI>Love-Potions</HI>; and an Account of the Jaw∣bone of an <HI>Elephant,</HI>
found in this County.</P>
<P>Chap. VIII. <HI>Of Men and Women.</HI> Beginning with an Ac∣count
of one who was neither. Of Men getting Children at 104 Years of Age. Of
<HI>Longing</HI> in Women, and dismem∣dering the <HI>Foetus</HI> like the
Object which gave the Fright. Some who had all the <HI>Signs</HI> of
<HI>Pregnancy,</HI> without being with Child; others having a Child without the
Signs. Of Children born with Teeth. Monstrous and imperfect Births. Of the
Persons born in this County, who were e∣minent <HI>Churchmen, Lawyers,</HI>
and <HI>Authors,</HI> or for their <HI>Valour</HI> by <HI>Land</HI> and
<HI>Sea,</HI> and for <HI>numerous Offsprings.</HI> Re∣markable Customs
relating to <HI>Births,</HI> as <HI>Borow-English,</HI> or Descent of Lands
to the <HI>Youngest</HI> before the <HI>Eldest</HI> born, with the Reason
presumed to be, that where this Custom remains, the Places were anciently
liable to the Privilege granted also in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by King
<HI>Evenus</HI> or <HI>Eugenius,</HI> to the <HI>Lords</HI> of
<HI>Mannors,</HI> that they should have the first Night's Lodging with
their <HI>Tenants</HI> Brides; so that <HI>eldest</HI> Sons being
supposed all <HI>Bastards,</HI> and of the Lord's beget∣ting, they
settled their Lands on the <HI>Youngest,</HI> as more likely to be their
own: But how common this Custom was all over <HI>England,</HI> may be seen
by the Tax afterwards gathered instead thereof, called <HI>Marcheta
Mulierum,</HI> in <HI>Bracton.</HI> Nor was the Privilege of
<HI>Lotherwits</HI> or <HI>Lierwit,</HI> expounded <PB N="182" REF="209"/> in
<HI>Fleta,</HI> to import the same as <HI>Mulcta Adulteriorum,</HI> and
remaining here to this day, much less lewd or immoral, being a Liberty of
taking a Compensation for Bastards, got or born in the Lordship, nay
also out of the Lordship for 1 <HI>l.</HI> 19. <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI>
paid to the <HI>Lords</HI>; and further, here was an <HI>Oak</HI> in
<HI>Knoll-Wood,</HI> which had such a superior Privilege of
<HI>Fornication,</HI> that if a Bastard was sworn to be begot under its
Shade, neither the <HI>Bishop</HI> nor <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Mannor</HI>
them∣selves could take any Cognizance of it. After these Births, we have
some Remarks upon <HI>Christnings,</HI> or <HI>Christian Names,</HI> how
they ran much upon <HI>Ralph</HI> and <HI>Walter,</HI> from two famous Earls
who lived in the County; and how some Families christned their eldest
Sons of the same Name for many Generations. Having done with the Births of
In∣fants, he proceeds to remarkable Passages in <HI>Childhood</HI> and
<HI>Youth,</HI> as the Impostures of <HI>William Perry,</HI> the Boy of
<HI>Bil∣son,</HI> who counterfeited himself bewitched or possessed;
whereof there is a Pamphlet printed in 1622. And this Story brings in other
Instances of <HI>imitating Sounds</HI> and <HI>Motions,</HI> whereof the
<HI>involuntary Imitations</HI> of <HI>Donald Monro,</HI> are most strange.
Next we advance to uncom∣mon Accidents and Qualities in adult Persons, and
first of Women. Some who yielded great Quantities of <HI>Milk,</HI> and the
medicinal Virtues of Women's Milk. One who <HI>slept</HI> 14 Days and Nights;
and another 7 Days. A Man who <HI>fasted</HI> 14 Days; and another in
<HI>Scotland</HI> 30 or 40 Days to∣gether. And here is a Copy from a
<HI>Record</HI> in the <HI>Tower,</HI> of a <HI>Pardon</HI> granted 31
<HI>Edward</HI> III. to <HI>Cicely de Rygeway</HI> (who was condemned at
<HI>Nottingham,</HI> for killing her Hus∣band) because she had fasted
forty Days without Meat or Drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of <HI>deaf</HI> Persons
understanding People by the Motion of their Lips. Of a Lady who had a Pin
squeezed out of her Arm, which she never could account for, yet parallel'd
with like Instances. Of strange Deliverances from <HI>Murder</HI> and
<HI>Hanging</HI>; particularly of <HI>Judith de Balsham,</HI> who having been
hang'd from nine a-Clock on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, till Sun-rising on
<HI>Tuesday,</HI> according to the Sen∣tence passed, yet lived after it,
and had a Pardon thereupon granted, 48th <HI>Hen.</HI> III. which is here
recited. And of a <HI>Swiss,</HI> who was hanged 13 times, yet could not by
that kind of Execution be put to death. Next we come to Men eminent for their
extraordinary <HI>Strength,</HI> excessive <HI>Stature,</HI> and <HI>Pious
Works;</HI> others who had their want of <HI>Sight</HI> wonderfully supply'd
by the Perfection of their other <PB N="183" REF="210"/> Senses; strange
Instances of <HI>Longing</HI> in Men, as well as Women; and other uncommon
Distempers. Of Men that never <HI>spit.</HI> The strange Force of
<HI>Custom</HI> in some <HI>Fools,</HI> especially one, who being removed
from a Place where he had heard a Clock constantly strike, would repeat the
Strokes punctually every Hour when he heard it not; and of the
<HI>Artificial,</HI> learn'd to become a <HI>Natural</HI> Clock, as Dr.
<HI>Willis</HI> has related. Here is another Instance of a <HI>Fool,</HI>
whose strange Sagacity exceeded the other telling not only the Changes of
the Moon, Times of Eclipses, and when <HI>Easter</HI> and
<HI>Whitsuntide</HI> fell, or any other <HI>moveable</HI> Feast, but at
what time they had, or should fall, at any dis∣tance of Years, which could
receive no Help from the <HI>Force</HI> of <HI>Custom:</HI> From the
Imperfections of Men, we have a Transition to their <HI>Vices,</HI> which
brings in the dread∣ful Judgment upon <HI>John Duncalf,</HI> who having stole
a Bible, had his Hands rotted off, according to his Wish, if that Theft were
true; from the <HI>Narrative</HI> of this Judgment pub∣lished by Mr. <HI>Ja.
Illingworth</HI> and Mr. <HI>Newey.</HI> This is followed with some wonderful
Escapes from <HI>Death</HI> in this County, particularly that of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. after the Bat∣tle of <HI>Worcester,</HI> who found an
<HI>Asylum</HI> at <HI>Bentley,</HI> and afterwards conferred several
Honours on Col. <HI>John Lane,</HI> as the <HI>Letters Patent</HI> here
exemplified, concerning the same, do testify. Here is likewise an Account
of the Preservation of his Followers; and by whose means his Majesty's
<HI>George</HI> came safe again to his Hands. From Men solitarily
con∣sidered, we proceed to some Remarks upon them jointly, in Examples of
Men extremely alike, or <HI>resembling</HI> each other, particularly Dr.
<HI>Hen. Fairfax</HI> and his Brother. Of Bishops twice married. Remarks on
many Families of one Name, and marrying among themselves. Of some odd
Customs; as at <HI>Guosall</HI>; where the Civil Law Judge deter∣mines
according to a Jury; <HI>Moseley</HI>'s <HI>Dole-penny</HI> at
<HI>Wal∣shall.</HI> The Society of <HI>Free-Masons</HI> in the
<HI>Moorlands</HI> of this County; with some curious Remarks thereon;
par∣ticularly on a fabulous MS. <HI>History</HI> of the said
<HI>Craft</HI>; their Lodges and Rules, with the Notice of an Act 3
<HI>Henry</HI> VI. abolishing this Society, and adjudging the holding of
their Congregations to be Felony. The Custom at <HI>Brewood,</HI> &amp;c. of
adorning their Walls with Boughs and Flowers. Many Examples of extream <HI>old
Age;</HI> many aged Persons living together, five and six Generations at a
time. Exam∣ples of several unaccountable <HI>Warnings</HI> of Death in some
<PB N="184" REF="211"/> Families, by divers kinds of Noise. Remarks on the
frontal <HI>Sutures</HI> in some <HI>Skulls,</HI> and of some large human
Bones: which, with an Omission or two in the Articles of <HI>valiant</HI>
Men, and those famous in the <HI>Law,</HI> finishes this Chapter.</P>
<P>Chap. IX. <HI>Of Arts.</HI> These are treated of after his
former Method; first, of such as relate to the <HI>Heavens</HI> and
<HI>Air</HI>; next, of <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Water-works</HI>; thirdly, tending
to the Im∣provement of <HI>Earths, Stones,</HI> or <HI>Plants,</HI> and
lastly, re∣specting <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Women.</HI> To this purpose he
begins with an Account of a new Sort of <HI>Dyals,</HI> and a <HI>Dyal
Quadrant;</HI> with an Experiment proving the Force of the Rarefaction of
<HI>Air.</HI> The <HI>Arts</HI> relating to <HI>Fire</HI> are, those of
burning <HI>Turf, Earth,</HI> &amp;c. for the fertilizing of Lands, and for
cer∣tain <HI>Iron-works,</HI> at the Anvil and Forge; particularly of the
Difficulty and Ingenuity of making Frying-pans and that there were but two
Masters of this Craft in the Kingdom. An improved Way of burning
<HI>Tiles.</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Dex∣terity in shooting with
<HI>Fire-Arms,</HI> exemplified in the two famous Shots he made
successively, thro' the Weather-cock of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s
Church-Steeple, at <HI>Stafford,</HI> with a screw'd Horseman's Pistol,
at threescore Yards distance, before King <HI>Charles</HI> I. Among the
<HI>Water-works,</HI> we have some Account of remarkable <HI>Mills,</HI> and
<HI>Mill-dams</HI>; of Brewing and Fining of <HI>Ale</HI>; and in the
Pleasure-Gardens, of <HI>Foun∣tains, Canals,</HI> &amp;c. Of Arts relating to
the <HI>Earth,</HI> we have here those of the <HI>Agriculture</HI> used in
this County: and of those concerning <HI>Stones,</HI> what is most
observable in Ar∣chitecture, both publick and private; with some copious
Remarks upon the Building of <HI>Churches,</HI> especially <HI>East</HI>
and <HI>West.</HI> Next of the <HI>Bridge</HI> at <HI>Burton</HI> upon
<HI>Trent</HI>; and after that, of the Hardening and Softning of <HI>Iron,</HI>
for the mak∣ing of several kinds of the said Hard Ware, with many
In∣stances of curious Improvements therein, and the ways used to keep them
from Rust. Then follow some Arts relating to <HI>Plants,</HI> as the
improving of <HI>Ropes,</HI> made with <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Rushes</HI>;
preserving of <HI>Beer</HI> with <HI>Heath</HI> instead of <HI>Hops</HI>;
and making Malt of <HI>Oats.</HI> After these, the Arts re∣lating to
<HI>Shrubs</HI> and <HI>Trees</HI>; as to the sowing of <HI>Acorns,</HI>
making <HI>Furze</HI> Hedges, planting of <HI>Vines,</HI> forming of
<HI>Topiary</HI> Works, Arbors, and other like Curiosities in Gardens, Parks
and Groves; with the managing of their <HI>Woods,</HI> as to Brushing,
Fencing, Barking, Felling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Excellency of some
<HI>Joyners</HI> and <HI>Turners</HI> Work thereon: also their Ma∣nagement of
<HI>Fruit-Trees.</HI> Thus we come to their Arts <PB N="185" REF="212"/>
concerning Animals; beginning with Bees and Bee-hives An Instrument to match
<HI>Game Cocks:</HI> Device to prevent <HI>Hogs</HI> from <HI>rooting</HI>; and
to cure some Distempers in Cattle; a new invented <HI>Bridle,</HI> or
<HI>Gag</HI> for <HI>scolding Women</HI>; and a <HI>Sledge</HI> for Smiths.
Improved <HI>Barrels</HI> for Drink; in <HI>Cookery</HI> potted <HI>Otters</HI>
tasting like <HI>Venison</HI>; and to punish <HI>Misde∣meanors,</HI> a
Pair of <HI>Finger-Stocks.</HI> Lastly, some odd kind of Pictures upon an
indented Board, which beheld directly, appear confused, but obliquely, the
Pictures of a King and Queen: also some curious Cut-work, in Paper, with
Scis∣sars, of Col. <HI>J. Lane</HI>'s Tomb, Trophies, Inscription,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And Part of a <HI>Greek</HI> Chapter which, laid on a black
Ground, was as legible as the same in a printed Testament.</P>
<P>Chap. X. <HI>Of Antiquities.</HI> And these, not so much of
Persons or Actions, as of <HI>Things</HI>; such as are remote from the
present Age, whether found under Ground, or whereof there yet remain any
Footsteps above it; as ancient <HI>Me∣dals, Ways, Lows, Pavements, Urns,
Monuments</HI> of Stone, <HI>Fortifications,</HI> &amp;c. whether of the
ancient <HI>Britains, Ro∣mans, Saxons, Danes,</HI> or <HI>Normans.</HI>
Beginning with the Au∣thor's Reasons, why the original Inhabitants of this
County might be <HI>Iceni,</HI> and the notable <HI>Remains</HI> of some
ancient <HI>British</HI> City near <HI>Wrottesley,</HI> of great Extant,
being about three or four Miles round; with some Ruins of
<HI>Fortifi∣cations</HI> presumed also to be theirs. Of their <HI>Arrow
Heads</HI> made of <HI>Flints,</HI> found here. Other Antiquities also of
<HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Origin; and particularly the Place where
<HI>Litchfield</HI> now is, so called from the <HI>dead Bodies</HI> of St.
<HI>Amphabale</HI>'s Com∣panions, who were martyr'd there. Of <HI>Roman</HI>
Antiqui∣ties, the most considerable in these Parts are, their <HI>publick
Ways;</HI> which here, with some other of their Antiquities also, are
copiously treated of. The <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Antiqui∣ties
are still more largely discuss'd, in relation to the build∣ing or
destroying of several Towns, Fortifications, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the
County. Here speaking of the <HI>Customs</HI> and <HI>Utensils</HI> of
the <HI>Danes,</HI> which obtained among these People, we have a large
Account and Sculpture of the <HI>Staffordshire Cloggs,</HI> or little
square Logs of Wood, which by the Notches and Incisions upon them,
supplied the Use of <HI>Almanacks</HI>; with many Remarks upon the Symbols
thereon, and the Com∣putations relating thereto; ending, as to this
<HI>Danish</HI> Part, with the Account of the famous Lady <HI>Godiva,</HI>
who rode through <HI>Coventry</HI> naked, to obtain many Privileges, for the
Inhabitants, of her Husband <HI>Leofric,</HI> Earl of <HI>Mercia</HI>; she
dying at his Village of <HI>Bromleyg</HI> in this County, accord∣ing 
<PB N="186" REF="213"/> to <HI>Knyghton,</HI> tho' buried at <HI>Coventry.</HI>
To these are added, some old Customs, whose Originals being obscure,
might commence as high as those Times: such as the Ser∣vice of the Lord of
<HI>Essington</HI> to the Lord of <HI>Hilton,</HI> round whose Hall-Fire,
he was to drive a Goose every New-Year's-Day three times, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
while <HI>Jack of Hilton,</HI> a whim∣sical kind of <HI>Aeolipile,</HI> being
a little brazen Image, in an im∣pudent Posture, filled with Water, is blowing
the Coals. Their merry Custom of the <HI>Hobbey-Horse Dance,</HI> &amp;c.
at <HI>Abbots Bromley</HI> had a good useful End in it; but the Cus∣tom at
<HI>Tutbury</HI> for the King of the <HI>Minstrells</HI> to arrest all the
Musicians in the said Franchise, who refused to do the yearly Services,
according to the Charter of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> for which they had
a Bull, given by the Prior of <HI>Tutbury,</HI> amidst all the Harmony
thereof, seems to have been at∣tended with much Discord, which produced an
Alteration according to the modern Ceremonies used in these their musical
Meetings, which yet are not void of Tumult and Mischief. That other Custom
at <HI>Tutbury,</HI> of finding a <HI>Flitch of Bacon</HI> for every married
Man, who took the Oath a Year and a Day after his Marriage, That he had never
wished to change his Wife, but would have taken her be∣fore all other Women
had she been single; whereby Sir <HI>Philip de Somervile</HI> held
<HI>Whichnovre,</HI> and other Manors; had a good Encouragement in it to the
making of mature Elections, and being contented with those they made; and was
parallel'd by that Custom also instituted at the Priory of
<HI>Dunmow</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> by the Lord <HI>Robert Fitzwalter, temp.
Hen</HI> III. which Ceremony is also here recited, from the History of that
Baron, printed 1616 Then follows an Ac∣count of some other Antiquities, as
the Donation of <HI>Heyley</HI> Castle to <HI>Hen. de Aldithleg,</HI> and the
Advowson of <HI>Penck∣ridge</HI> Church to the Archbishops of
<HI>Dublin,</HI> by King <HI>John</HI>; which, with the founding of some
other old Structures, also the Account of an Entrenchment, anciently the Seat
of the <HI>Cockains,</HI> a monumental Stone in Memory of the Death of
<HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> and the mention of a few more emi∣nent
Persons, omitted in their proper Place, concludes this elaborate and curious
History of <HI>Staffordshire</HI>; and how grateful soever our Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hor's Acknowledgments throughout the
same appear, for his Encouragement therein, he yet ends with informing us, he
is 
<Q REND="inline">"pretty fully resolved never to publish any
more of these Histories, tho' I think, says he, I was never so fit as
now, unless commanded by a Power that I must not resist."</Q> To the
Work he has joined <PB N="187" REF="214"/> a useful <HI>Index,</HI> also his
<HI>Proposals</HI> for <HI>Subscription</HI>; which are very reasonable,
no more than a Penny <HI>per Sheet,</HI> a Penny each <HI>Plate,</HI> and the
<HI>Map</HI> Sixpence; which for each Copy, he guesses will amount to about
ten or twelve Shillings: and the whole ends with a <HI>List</HI> of the

<P>THIS Collection, made about the Beginning of the Reign of our late
Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> by a Gentleman lately dead, as we have some Reason to
believe, who was well acquainted with the Records of this Kingdom, and the
Pe∣digrees of the most eminent Families in it, begins with
<HI>Ab∣stracts</HI> from the <HI>Patent Rolls</HI> of <HI>Grants,</HI> which
were made by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. from the <HI>first</HI> to the
<HI>thirtieth</HI> Year of his Reign, extending to Page 32: which is followed
with a long Recital in <HI>Latin,</HI> of many other <HI>Grants,</HI> in the
same Period, of <HI>Abbey Lands,</HI> &amp;c. to whom, and where also
demised, as far as Page 68; concluding with the said King's <HI>Grants</HI>
to the Lord Chancellor <HI>Audley,</HI> of <HI>Duke's Place,</HI> &amp;c.
copied from the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> to Page 76. So we come to the
<HI>Grants</HI> of the Reversions of <HI>Mildenhall, Marlborough,</HI>
&amp;c. made by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. in the first Year of his Reign, to
his Uncle, <HI>Edward,</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI>; whereof we have here
two large Copies in <HI>Latin,</HI> to Page 135. Next we come to an Abstract

<HI>Oxford.</HI> 1720. 8<HI>vo.</HI> Pages 327; besides a long
Preface.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Publisher</HI> of these <HI>Discourses</HI>
shews us in his <HI>Pre∣face,</HI> that Experience and Practice are better
helps in the Study of <HI>Antiquities</HI> than General Rules; yet that these
are to be regarded, and better Accounts of our Antiquities to be given. Next he
commends the <HI>Baroccian</HI> Collection of <HI>Greek</HI> MSS. and Dr.
<HI>Langbain</HI>'s noble Design of publish∣ing divers Volumes of
Fragments, which requir'd Assist∣ance; and that the Clergy ought to have
better Provision to enable them for such Public Services. That the
<HI>Polyglott</HI> Bible is a noble Instance of what shou'd be expected
from <HI>Joint Labours</HI>; requisite also in our own <HI>History</HI>
and <HI>Anti∣quities.</HI> That such <HI>Societies</HI> ought to have
<HI>stated Meetings,</HI> and <HI>write</HI> upon <HI>intricate
Subjects,</HI> as these <HI>Antiquaries</HI> did. Further of the said
<HI>Society,</HI> and this Collection; and how they were summon'd to give
their Opinions; with a <HI>List</HI> of <PB N="189" REF="216"/> the Members at
one of their Meetings, 41 <HI>Eliz.</HI> Remarks upon some <HI>Roman</HI>
Coins and Antiquities. The Neglect of our Historians herein, and Praises of
Dr. <HI>And. Pern.</HI> Some Obscurities in these Discourses
observed, and why our An∣cestors hid their MSS. under Ground, and in old
Walls; with an Example from Sir <HI>Thomas Elliot</HI>'s <HI>Dictionary,</HI>
in the Word <HI>Britannia,</HI> and the <HI>Etymology</HI> thereof. That the
Antients were more exact than the Moderns in noting the Bounds of Places. That
the <HI>Saxons</HI> imitated the <HI>Romans</HI> herein. Whence the Division
of <HI>Shires</HI> is ascribed to <HI>Al∣fred</HI>; and why he is called the
Founder of <HI>Oxford</HI> Univer∣sity. Of King <HI>Edward</HI> the
Confessor's Chappel at <HI>Islip</HI>; with a <HI>Sculpture</HI> thereof.
Also concerning the Minister of <HI>Ashdon</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI> Of

de∣sired. Remarks upon our ancient <HI>Tournaments.</HI> Further Praises of
Mr. <HI>Tate</HI>'s Skill in the <HI>British</HI> as well as
<HI>English</HI> Antiquities, and of his Acquaintance with the learned Mr.
<HI>Jones.</HI> The Publisher's Acknowledgment to <HI>John Bridges,</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for his Communications. And his Addition of two
Discourses in this Work, from his own Collections; which, with his
Observation to us how careful he has been, not to vary from his MSS,
finishes this <HI>Preface</HI> of 134 Pages.</P>
<P>After the Table of Subscribers, the first Discourse in

<HI>or</HI> KNYGHTHODE, <HI>translated out of the Frensshe and imprinted
by</HI> <HI REND="blackletterType">William Caxton.</HI> Quarto, without
Date.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS thin Volume, of about one hundred Pages, is perhaps one of
the scarcest Books now remaining of that our first Printer; seeing it
has so little occurred to those who have attempted to give us any
Catalogues of his Pub∣lications. Tho' no Date when it was printed is
express'd, yet may it be guessed at within a Year over or under, by
sup∣posing it in 1484; from the short Reign of that Prince to whom it is
inscribed at the End, as will presently appear. It is printed with large
<HI>initial</HI> Letters at the Beginning of the Chapters; with only one Sort
of <HI>Points,</HI> which are ob∣lique or leaning Dashes; some double or
<HI>united Types,</HI> as in his other Books, which we have hitherto
observed; also with <HI>Signatures,</HI> but no <HI>Catch-words</HI> at the
Bottom of the Leaves, nor any <HI>Numbers</HI> on them at Top. And is di∣vided
into <HI>eight Chapters.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>first,</HI> shews how a Knight, who was a Hermit,
be∣stowed this Rule or Order of Chivalry upon a Squire. The
<HI>second,</HI> treats of the Beginning of Chivalry or Knighthood. The
<HI>third,</HI> of the Office of Chivalry. <HI>Fourth,</HI> Of the Examination
that ought to be made to the <HI>Esquyer,</HI> when he will enter into the
Order of Chivalry. <HI>Fifth,</HI> In what manner the Squire ought to receive
Chivalry. <HI>Sixth,</HI> Of the <HI>Sygnefyaunce</HI> of the Arms belonging to
a Knight. <HI>Seventh,</HI> Of the Customs that appertain to a Knight. And
<HI>eight,</HI> Of the Honours that ought to be done to a Knight. By all which
it will appear how different the Honour, the Pro∣fession, the
Qualifications, required in Knights anciently, were from those for which they
have been created in lat∣ter Times.</P>
<P>At the End we have the Printer's Rehearsal in these Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"Here endeth the Book of <HI>the Ordre of
Chyvalry;</HI> whiche Book is translated oute of <HI>Frensshe</HI> in to

<BIBL><HI>The Workes of</HI> Sir THOMAS MORE, <HI>Knyght,
sometyme Lord Chancellour of</HI> England; <HI>written by him in the</HI>
English <HI>Tonge. Printed at</HI> London <HI>at the Costes of</HI> John
Cawod, John Waly, <HI>and</HI> Richard Tottell, <HI>Anno</HI> 1557. Fol. Pages
1458, besides Tables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THO' Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> suffer'd Death for maintaining the
Supremacy of the Pope over that of his Sovereign, as may be read in these
<HI>Works,</HI> and in the many Accounts of his <HI>Life,</HI> set forth by
the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholics, who have much magnified him for his said
Writings and Sufferings; yet are there many things in this Collection of his
<HI>English</HI> Works observable to all Readers, who are even not attach'd
to his own Persuasion, as it is one of the most copious Ex∣emplars we
have in Print of the best <HI>English</HI> Stile in those Days, and
contains some curious Pieces or Parcels of <HI>Civil,</HI> and many of
<HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> History, relating to the Times of our
<HI>Reformation:</HI> and, overlooking the superstitious Adhe∣rence to his
Cause, with some sophistical Arguments ne∣cessary to support it,
is fraught with many Testimonies of virtuous Learning, fine Genius, and good
Morals for the universal Conduct of Life.</P>
<P>The Book was collected together and published from the Author's
printed Copies and Manuscripts, by his Nephew <HI>William Rastell,</HI>
Serjeant at Law, and dedicated to Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; that it might forward
her Majesty's <HI>most</HI> Godly <HI>Puspose, in purging this her
Realm of all wicked Heresies.</HI></P>
<P>After the Table of Contents, and a tolerable good In∣dex, the
Collection commences with some Pieces of our Author's Poetry, which he wrote
for his Diversion, in his younger Days. As, the Merry <HI>Jest,</HI> how a
<HI>Serjeant</HI> would learn to play the <HI>Frier</HI>; containing some
good Reproofs of those who act out of their Sphere. Then follow his
<HI>Verses</HI> to explain the <HI>Images</HI> in some <HI>Pageants,</HI>
which he devised in his Father's House; describing the several Stages
and Consequents of Life. After this, we have his rueful <HI>La∣mentation of
the Death of Queen Elizabeth,</HI> Wife of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in
<HI>Feb.</HI> 1503. Next come his Prefatory Verses before the <HI>Book of
Fortune:</HI> These Verses make about four <PB N="195" REF="222"/> Sheets.
Hence we pass to his Works in Prose; beginning with <HI>the Life of John
Picus, Earl of Mirandula, an Ita∣lian Nobleman,</HI> of great Virtue and
Learning, who died in 1494, aged 32; with several of his Letters, and his
Ver∣ses, translated from the <HI>Latin,</HI> and dedicated to his beloved
Sister <HI>Joyeuce Leigh.</HI> After this, we have <HI>the History of King
Richard</HI> III. written by our Author when he was one of the Under Sheriffs
of <HI>London,</HI> about the Year 1513, but unfinished, and published
before, in the <HI>Chronicles</HI> of <HI>Harding</HI> and <HI>Hall</HI>; tho'
very corruptly, and much varying from his own Copy whence this is printed. The
next is a long Treatise <HI>on the four last Things,</HI> Death, Dome,
Pain, and Joy; with several Chapters on Pride, Envy, Wrath, Covetousness,
Gluttony, and Slouth; composed after he was knighted, of the Privy Council to
King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and Under-Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> about the
Year 1522, but unfinish'd, and we presume never before printed; but that
which succeeds, it was as we are informed, the Year after it was written;
entitled, A <HI>Dialogue</HI> of Sir <HI>T. More,</HI> then Chancellor of the
Dutchy of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> wherein is treated <HI>of the Veneration and
Worship of Images</HI> and <HI>Reliques</HI>; praying to <HI>Saints,</HI> and
going on <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> with many things touching the Sects of
<HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Tyndale,</HI> begun by the one in <HI>Saxony,</HI> and
labour'd to be brought by the other into <HI>England</HI>; made in the Year
1528. This is a large Trea∣tise, in four Books, divided into many Chapters,
and illus∣trated with many pleasant Examples, Tales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with
which he had a Memory plentifully furnished, and a Ta∣lent happily
constituted to apply them. To some, who made Objection thereat, we find his
Answer was, 
<Q REND="inline">"That for a Layman to tell his Mind merrily, might
sometimes better become him, than seriously and solemnly to
preach."</Q> His next Treatise is, <HI>The Supplication of Souls,</HI>
written 1529, against a famous little Tract, call'd, <HI>The Supplication of
Beggars;</HI> (written by <HI>Simon Fish</HI> of <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> which
was very Instrumental to the Reformation, and is reprinted in <HI>Fox.</HI>)
To that follows, <HI>The Confutation of Tyndale's An∣swer,</HI> (to the
<HI>Dialogue</HI> aforesaid) made 1532, by our Au∣thor. In the Preface
hereof, we have a large Account of many late Books, and their Authors, whom Sir
<HI>Thomas</HI> calls <HI>Heretics.</HI> Then we come to <HI>Tyndale</HI>'s
Preface, divided, with our Author's Answers to the several Particulars
alter∣nately; which ends the <HI>first</HI> Book: but the <HI>first
Part</HI> of the Work contains 3 Books. The <HI>second Part,</HI> written
1533, <PB N="196" REF="223"/> after he had given over his Chancellor's Office,
begins at the fourth Book: It contains <HI>Tyndale</HI>'s <HI>Defence</HI> for
his <HI>Trans∣lation</HI> of the <HI>Testament</HI>; with our Author's
<HI>Answers</HI> to the several Parts interfering, as before; and herein,
having consider'd <HI>Tyndale</HI>'s Church, to the End of the
<HI>seventh</HI> Book, we come in the <HI>eight,</HI> to our Author's
Confutation of <HI>Barnes</HI> his Church in the same manner: The
<HI>ninth</HI> Book is a Summary of the rest, was not printed before, and
appears at the End to have been left unfinished. This Work is succeeded by
<HI>a Letter</HI> of our Author, written at <HI>Chelchith</HI> (or
<HI>Chelsea</HI>) in 1533, <HI>against the little Book of John Frith upon
the Sacrament</HI>; and both concluded with a long <HI>Apology,</HI> written
and published also the same Year, in Answer to the Objections which
were made, more es∣pecially to these his last Writings, against his
said three An∣tagonists. These Pieces of his, producing a large
Treatise against him, call'd, <HI>Salem and Bizance,</HI> he writ the
same Year his <HI>Debellacion of Salem and Bizance.</HI> The same Year he
wrote his <HI>Answer to the first Part of the Poisoned Book, which a
nameless Heretic named the Supper of the Lord.</HI> His Postscript to
this Treatise ends with this Allu∣sion; 
<Q REND="inline">"Of all my Adversaries, could I never hitherto
find any one, but when he catcheth once a Fall, as each of them hath caught
full many, there lyeth he, still tumb∣ling and toltring in Mire, and neither
Spur, nor Bridle can one Inch prevail, but, as tho' they were not fall'n in a
Puddle of Dirt, but rubbed and laid in Litter under the Manger, at their
Ease, they whine, and they bite, and they kick, and they spurn at him that
would help them up."</Q> His next Performance is entitled, <HI>A Dialogue of
Comfort against Tribulation,</HI> made by an <HI>Hungarian</HI> in
<HI>La∣tin,</HI> and translated out of <HI>Latin</HI> into <HI>French,</HI>
and out of <HI>French</HI> into <HI>English,</HI> in 1534, when he was
Prisoner in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> And this is followed with
<HI>a Treatise to receive the Blessed Body of our Lord sacramentally
and ver∣tually both,</HI> written in the same Year and Place. The next is, a
<HI>Treatise Historical, containing the bitter Passion of our Saviour
Christ, after the Course and Order of the four Evangelists</HI>; with an
Exposition upon their Words, taken mostly out of the Sayings of sundry
good old holy Doctors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This copious Treatise was also
written in the same Year and Place aforesaid; 'tis mostly taken from
<HI>John Gerson's Monatesseron</HI>; but is unfinished, the Author now
being denied the Use of Books, Pens, Ink, and Paper. <PB N="197" REF="224"/>
Yet here follows, <HI>His Godly Instructions, Meditations, and Prayers,</HI>
in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> written with a Coal, both before and
after his Condemnation, which was on <HI>Thurs∣day</HI> the first of
<HI>July,</HI> 1535, <HI>Anno</HI> 27 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and he was
<HI>beheaded</HI> on <HI>Tower-Hill</HI> the <HI>Tuesday</HI> following. The
rest of the Volume consists of his <HI>Letters,</HI> &amp;c. written at
sundry times on divers Occasions, beginning with his Letter from the Court
at <HI>Woodstock,</HI> to his Wife the Lady <HI>Alice</HI> at
<HI>Chelsea,</HI> in 1528, the Year before he was Lord Chancel∣lor,
containing Consolations to her for the Loss she had there by Fire. Next
we have his Epitaph, written by him∣self in <HI>Latin,</HI> in 1532, soon
after he had laid down his Chan∣cellor's Office; which he caused to be
inscribed upon his Tomb, which he had erected in <HI>Chelsea</HI> Church,
while he was Lord Chancellor; with a Translation of it. Then follow four
Letters which he wrote after he had given over the Office of Chancellor, and
before he was imprison'd, <HI>viz.</HI> Three to Mr <HI>Tho. Cromwell</HI> of
the King's Privy Coun∣cil, and one to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. all in the Year
1533. Next we have his Letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wrote while he was Pri∣soner
in the <HI>Tower,</HI> beginning with his Letter to his eldest Daughter Mrs.
<HI>Margaret Roper,</HI> upon his refusing the Oath. Another to his said
Daughter, written with a Coal. His <HI>Answer</HI> to a Letter of hers, which
seemingly persuaded him to take the Oath, that she might get the Liberty
she did obtain of Access to him. Her Answer thereunto. His Letter to all
his Friends, written with a Coal; with two Stanza's upon Fortune. Lady
<HI>Alice Alington</HI>'s Letter to Mrs. <HI>Margaret Roper.</HI> A long
Answer by her or her Fa∣ther to the same. His two Letters to Doctor
<HI>Nicholas Wilson,</HI> also Prisoner in the <HI>Tower,</HI> 1534. His
Daughter <HI>Roper</HI>'s Answer to a Letter of his, when he was shut up
close Prisoner, 1534; with his Answers both to the same and another
she had sent him. His Letter to Mr. <HI>Leder,</HI> a virtuous Priest,
the same Year. Two more of his Letters to his Daughter in 1535. His
<HI>Latin</HI> Epistle to Mr. <HI>An∣thony Bonuyse,</HI> Merchant of
<HI>Luca,</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> his old Friend, written with a Coal the
same Year: with the Translation. His last Letter was to his Daughter
<HI>Roper,</HI> the Day before his Death, containing his Blessing to, and
desires to be re∣commended to the Prayers of her, and his other Friends and
Relations.</P>

Leaves.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS much-commended Book is dedicated to <HI>Edward de Vere,</HI>
Earl of <HI>Oxenford,</HI> Lord Great Chamberlayne of <HI>England,</HI> by the
<HI>Translator,</HI> who tells his Lordship, at this time but in the Flower
of his Age, 
<Q REND="inline">"that hereon when your Honour shall be at
leisure to look, bestowing such Regard as you are accustom'd to do on
Books of <HI>Geography, Histories,</HI> and other good Learning, wherein I am
privy your Honour taketh singular Delight, I doubt not, but you shall have
cause to judge your Time very well applied. And so much the rather, for
that in the Study of Geography, it is expedient, first to know exactly the
Situation of our own home where we abide, before that we shall be able to
judge how other Countries do lie unto us, which are far distant from us;
besides, that it were a foul Shame to be inquisitive of the State of
<HI>Foreign</HI> Lands, and to be igno∣rant of our <HI>own.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Then follows the Translator's <HI>Preface</HI>; in which he
ac∣knowleges the Assistance of Dr. <HI>Yale,</HI> for the Translation
of some Names, especially in the <HI>British</HI> Tongue; and the
Faultiness of the <HI>Latin</HI> Copy which was printed at <HI>Cologne.</HI>
He also apologizes for his Translation of the Title, as above, it being
called by the Author, <HI>Commentarioli Britannicae Descriptionis
Fragmentum,</HI> that is literally, <HI>A Fragment of a little Treatise of
the Description of Britain,</HI> which he thinks not much beside the
Meaning of the Title he hath given it. Next we have other Commendations in
Verse, namely by <HI>T. Brown,</HI> Prebend of <HI>Westminster, Ed.
Grant,</HI> Schoolmaster of <HI>Westminster, Lodowick Lhuyd,</HI> &amp;c.
Lastly <PB N="199" REF="226"/> concludes his Preface with a Commendation of
the Author, which for Brevity we refer to, having a Character more Modern, here
to subjoin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Copy of this Book now before us,
which had been the late Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s of <HI>Oxford,</HI> he has
written as follows: 
<Q REND="inline">"This is a very rare Book and the Translation
is done admi∣rably well; and therefore the Encomiastick Verses are
deser∣vedly put before it. I have seen a very imperfect and misera∣bly
shatter'd one, go at a considerable Price in an Auction."</Q></NOTE>. Nor
is the Translator unattend∣ed with Verses by his Brothers <HI>Laurence</HI>
and <HI>John Twyn.</HI></P>
<P>After an Alphabetical Table, we have the Author's
<HI>Epistle</HI> to <HI>Abraham Ortelius</HI> of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> wherein we
observe, he was now suffering under a dangerous Fever. Yet that he had here
sent him his Description of <HI>Wales</HI> and of <HI>England,</HI> with
the ancient Names, and another <HI>England</HI>; besides cer∣tain Fragments
written with his own Hand, probably for his great Book of <HI>Geography.</HI>
This Epistle is dated from <HI>Denbigh, Aug.</HI> 30, 1568, and
subscrib'd yours, both living and dying, <HI>H. Lhuyd.</HI></P>
<P>After a Table of near seventy Authors used in this little
Work, our learned Antiquary begins it, with his Notice of the Promise he had
made to his Correspondent aforesaid, of sending him the Geographical
Description of <HI>Britain,</HI> with the most ancient Names, as well
<HI>Latin</HI> as <HI>British</HI>; wherein, because he finds he must
disagree from the Opinions of others, he has thought it expedient, first,
in a few Words, to disclose the Effect of his Purpose, and by what
Arguments and Authorities he is moved to change or ascribe to others, the
Names of some Countries, Towns, Rivers, and other Places. But before he takes
this in hand, enters upon some Explana∣tion of the <HI>British Tongue,</HI>
touching the signification of the Letters, and manner of pronouncing the
same: The Igno∣rance of which Tongue having driven many notable Men to such
shifts, that endeavouring to wind themselves out of one, they have fallen
into many. After this he begins with the <HI>Etymologies</HI> of
<HI>Britain</HI>; shews their Errors who have darken'd all the Names of
Places and Men with those of <HI>Latin</HI> De∣rivation; whereof <HI>Robert
Coenalis</HI> is particularly arraign'd; so proceeds to confirm Sir
<HI>Thomas Eliot</HI>'s Observation out of an old Manuscript that
<HI>Britain</HI> was anciently written <HI>Prytannia,</HI> as if it were
derived from <HI>Pryd</HI> signifying Come∣liness or <HI>Beauty,</HI> and
<HI>Cain,</HI> or <HI>White,</HI> with the first Letter sunk for
smoothness in Conjunction. After this he takes <PB N="200" REF="227"/>
occasion to chastise <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> the <HI>Italian,</HI> and
<HI>Hector Boethius</HI> the <HI>Scot</HI>; whereof the first, in his
<HI>History of Britain,</HI> mainly sought not only to obscure the Glory
of the <HI>British</HI> Name, but also to defame the <HI>Britains</HI>
themselves with scandalous Lyes; and the other, in attempting to raise
the <HI>Scots</HI> out of Darkness, attributes whatever he finds the
<HI>Ro∣mans</HI> or <HI>Britains</HI> have done worthy of Commendation in this
Island, all to his Countrymen. Yet does he also believe that
<HI>Brutus</HI> came into <HI>Britain</HI> with his <HI>Trojans,</HI> and took
upon him the Government thereof; whence they might also be called
<HI>Britains.</HI> Then he proceeds to the <HI>Division</HI>of
<HI>Britain</HI> into <HI>Lhoegria, Albania,</HI> and <HI>Cambria</HI>; so to
the En∣trance of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and by whom the Country was called
<HI>England,</HI> and the People <HI>Saison.</HI> But now returning to treat
more particularly of <HI>Lhoegr</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> he begins first
with <HI>Kent,</HI> and having given an Account of the ancient Names of Places
in this and other Counties, to <HI>fol.</HI> 35, where, having also reproved
<HI>Sleydan</HI>'s partial Abridgment of <HI>Froissart,</HI> and ended with
the Descent of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> he begins, as in a <HI>Second Part,</HI>
with these Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"Now that we have wander'd over all
<HI>England</HI> called <HI>Lhoegr,</HI> let us next in Or∣der proceed to the
second Region of <HI>Britain,</HI> which, of our Countrymen, is called
<HI>Albania,</HI> of the Inhabitants, <HI>Scotland.</HI>"</Q> Here he
observes, That there was never any Writer of Name, that made mention either
of <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>Redshanks</HI> be∣fore <HI>Vespasian</HI>'s
Time, about the Year of our Lord's Incar∣nation 72, when <HI>Merrigus</HI> or
<HI>Arviragus</HI> reigned in <HI>Britain.</HI> And that they cou'd not be
called by the <HI>Romans, Phichtiani,</HI> for painting their Bodies, since
they were called by that Name before they were ever known to the
<HI>Latins,</HI> and were the <HI>Britains</HI> whom <HI>Caesar</HI> and
others report to have painted themselves <HI>blue</HI> with the Herb
<HI>Woad,</HI> that they might appear more terrible to their Enemies. Then
having given us the Original of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Redshanks,</HI>
and sharply corrected <HI>Boethius</HI> for his many Falsities, he
proceeds, in the like Manner as he had done of <HI>England,</HI> briefly to
describe or explain the Names of several principal Places in
<HI>Albania</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the circumjacent Islands; so
passes to the third Part con∣cerning <HI>Wales,</HI> upon which our Author
is most copious, as well in describing the Manners of the People, and the
Cha∣racters of some of their most ancient Worthies, as the an∣cient Names
of the Places: Interspersed with many learned Authorities, curious
Observations, and critical Remarks. Of which, we shall mention only his
Reproof of the <HI>Golden</HI> <PB N="201" REF="228"/> <HI>Number,</HI> his
Description of <HI>Wenefride</HI>'s Well; with other Censures again of
<HI>P. Virgil</HI> and <HI>William Petit</HI> the Monk, and lastly of
<HI>Gildas,</HI> for his hard Character of the <HI>Britains</HI>; as if he was
to be regarded merely as a Preacher 
<Q REND="inline">"whose Cus∣tom is, very sharply to inveigh
against the Faults of their Hearers: Wherefore, if we seek Authorities out
of Sermons as <HI>Polydore</HI> hath done; what Parish, what Town, what
Nation, or Kingdom may escape Infamy? What hath <HI>Bernard</HI> written of
the <HI>Romans?</HI> Thus surely, terming them impious, unfaithful,
seditious, dishonest, traiterous, great Speakers, but little Doers.
These Things are by <HI>Divines</HI> spoken in the Pulpit, according unto
their Man∣ner, that the like Faults may be amended, and the Life reformed; not
that the <HI>Romans</HI> or <HI>Britains</HI> were such in∣deed. Neither is
there any Man, unless he be a shame∣less Sycophant, that lyeth in wait
for all Occasions to dis∣praise and accuse, which will go about, by
wresting of Sentences forth of the Sermons of Preachers, slanderous∣ly to
tax, and infamously to note any whole Covent, Shire, City, or People.
Wherefore, let such idle and ill-disposed Slanderers leave off, and
suffer the true Re∣nown of <HI>Britain</HI> to appear to the World. Neither
judge me good Reader, of too sharp a Tongue; seeing (so God help me)
neither Envy of any Foreign Name, neither Thirst of Vain-glory, neither
Hatred of any Nation, but alone the Love of my Country, which is evil spoken
of undeservedly, and desire to set forth the Truth, have provoked me to
write thus much."</Q> Then follows a short and modest Conclusion, after
which, the whole is ended with certain <HI>Welch,</HI> or rather true
<HI>British</HI> Words converted into <HI>Latin</HI> by the Author, and now
translated into <HI>English.</HI></P>

<HI>and</HI> Pillars <HI>of the</HI> CHURCH <HI>of</HI> ROME, <HI>for

<HI>Student in Divini∣ty, and Chief Keeper of the</HI> Public Library
<HI>in</HI> OXFORD, <HI>&amp;c. With a sufficient</HI> Answer <HI>unto</HI>

of <HI>The Grounds of the Old Religion and the New.</HI> Divi∣ded into V.
Parts. Lond. Quarto. 1612.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE Learned Author of this Work, in his Dedication to <HI>George
Abbot,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> tells him, 
<Q REND="inline">"he has written this Book in <HI>English</HI>
for the Benefit of his poor seduced Countrymen, who are persuaded by the
Priests and Jesuits that there is no such Matter, and that their Books
are freest from Corruption, and Minds from Falshood; that Protestants are
guilty of this Crime, and sundry others. But as St. <HI>Austen</HI>
observed of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> that they were shameless and impudent,
without Fore∣heads, not caring what they said: So it is with the
<HI>Papists</HI>; they do not only impudently deny, but wickedly translate
the Crime from themselves unto others. For if forging false
<HI>Treatises,</HI> or Corruption of the True; changing of
<HI>Scriptures,</HI> or altering of Men's Words, contrary to their Meaning, be
certain Notes of Heresy, how heretical then must the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>Rome</HI> be, wherein this <HI>Doctrine of Cor∣ruption</HI> is both openly
<HI>taught</HI> and <HI>profess'd?</HI> As their <HI>Indices
Expurgatorii;</HI> the <HI>Printing</HI> of the <HI>Fathers</HI> Works at
<HI>Rome,</HI> and the Evidence of the Fact doth plainly declare. All which is
plainly shewed in this small Treatise, and whatsoever else doth tend
thereunto."</Q> Then he observes how his said Patron, the Archbishop, had
long since in his Book against <HI>Hill,</HI> begun to discover this
devilish Policy of the common Adversary, and his Grace's Example has
en∣couraged him to proceed therein, and embolden'd him to consecrate his
Labours with himself, wholly at his Grace's Disposition.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="230"/>After this Address, which gives, in this
Part we have here extracted, a Glimpse of the Contents of the Work before us,
we have an ample <HI>Advertisement to the Christian Rea∣der,</HI> wherein
he tells him, that 
<Q REND="inline">"having fully travelled this vast Wilderness
of Sin, I have thought it my Duty to leave certain <HI>Land-Marks</HI> behind
me, for their Direction which shall come hereafter."</Q> The whole Book is
resol∣ved into <HI>five Parts</HI>: The <HI>First</HI> shews, <HI>The
Bastardy of the False Fathers,</HI> and in this Part these few Things are
to be no∣ted, That there are 187 several Treatises, here distinctly
produced, which are shrewdly suspected, if not plainly con∣victed of
Forgery by the <HI>Papists</HI> themselves. That our Author follows herein
the Judgment of their most esteemed Wri∣ters, such as <HI>Bellarmine</HI>
and <HI>Baronius, Possevin</HI> and <HI>Gretser, Sextus Senensis,
Angelus Roccha, Pamelius,</HI> and sundry others; sometimes, tho' seldom,
citing <HI>Erasmus,</HI> or following his Cen∣sure, because the
<HI>Papists</HI> say he was an <HI>Apostate</HI>; tho' he defend∣ed the
Religion, then openly maintain'd, against <HI>Oecolampadi∣us, Melancthon,
Martin Luther</HI> and others; was accounted in the bosom of the Church, and
saluted by the Name of Son, by <HI>Adrian</HI> VI. and <HI>Leo</HI> X. And
however he was accused for a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> seeing his Apology
satisfied the Pope in his Life∣time, why should the <HI>Papists</HI>
traduce him being dead? Tho' he were in Heart and Profession a
<HI>Papist,</HI> God made him write against the Abuses of Popery, rather
than against the Religion itself, as himself says. But leaving him, let
them consider the rest who were inflexible <HI>Papists,</HI> and see
here how the best of them are driven to censure these Treatises, yet
enforced to make use of them, abusing the simple Reader, by the frequent
Citation of <HI>Clement, Cyprian, Ambrose, Au∣gustine, Hierome,</HI> and
the rest, when no one Scrip of their Writings is alledg'd; yet
<HI>Cocceius</HI> their Master has been bold to set down the Age when every
one of these Fathers lived, to those bastard Treatises, which
themselves never saw. Our Author begins his said <HI>Catalogue,</HI> in
this first Part with <HI>Ab∣dias,</HI> who lived in the Time of St.
<HI>Paul,</HI> and ends it with <HI>Isodore,</HI> who flourish'd not long
after St. <HI>Gregory</HI>; yet, in this Part, he comprises not all the
Treatises of the Fathers who lived within the Six Hundred Years, condemned by
<HI>Papists,</HI> nor many more detected by the <HI>Protestants,</HI> but
only those he finds cited by the <HI>Papists</HI> in their Books of
Controversy; especially when they are alledg'd to gain Credit with the
simple People; which they well might do, since some Learn∣ed Men here
named have been deceived, to cite thefe For∣geries, <PB N="204" REF="231"/> as
the Works of the Fathers, who lived before <HI>Lu∣ther</HI>'s Time, so they
cou'd not be forged by <HI>Protestants,</HI> who according to the Opinion of
the <HI>Papists</HI> derive their Origin from him. And as to their being
cited sometimes by learn∣ed <HI>Protestants</HI> also, 'tis but
reasonable, as one side has used them for their Convenience, that they
shou'd be as free for the other. After this <HI>Catalogue,</HI> which
comprehends 71 Pages, we have a List of the <HI>Names</HI> of the
<HI>Author</HI>'s whose <HI>Books</HI> are cited; and a brief <HI>Table</HI>
wherein is declared, the <HI>Use</HI> that <HI>Papists</HI> make of these
<HI>Bastard Treatises:</HI> With an∣other <HI>Table,</HI> shewing who
they were <HI>written by,</HI> or <HI>ascribed to,</HI> and the
<HI>Characters</HI> of them. Thus we come to</P>
<P>Part II. <HI>Of the Corruption of the True Fathers,</HI> wherein
is the greater Danger, because it may spread farther before espied. And
here our Author takes the Word <HI>Fathers</HI> in a large Sense, extending
it as far as <HI>Gregory de Valentia</HI> does, unto the best learned of all
Ages. His Observations are ta∣ken from the most learned
<HI>Protestants,</HI> and particularly his chief Encourager the learned Dr.
<HI>Bilson,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester.</HI> Further, this Part
contains, 50 Proofs of corrupted Places in these Ecclesiastical Writers.
In the 26th Proof, there is a Story rehearsed by our Author of Bishop
<HI>Jewel,</HI> who citing St. <HI>Gregory</HI>'s <HI>Epistles</HI> in a
Visitation Sermon, at <HI>Abingdon</HI> in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> was defamed
for corrupting his Au∣thor's Sense; which caused all the MS. of that Father
to be search'd, whereby it was found, that the <HI>Popish</HI> Editions
on∣ly were corrupted, that the Bishop had quoted the genuine Sense, and
that those who charged such Corruptions upon him were themselves most
guilty of them. Our Author concludes this Part, with his Wishes for a
<HI>Protestant</HI> Edi∣tion of the Councils; and observes, that Dr.
<HI>Ward,</HI> Master of <HI>Sidney-Sussex</HI> College, in
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> had bestowed many Years Pains in this way, and that his
Endeavours wou'd tend to excellent Purposes, if he might be prevail'd on to
publish them; but if any Thing keep him back, it is an humble Conceit he has
ever had, to think himself so much the less able, the more sufficient
others esteem him. This Part is comprised in 103 Pages, and has in another
Page, The <HI>Names</HI> added, of the <HI>Authors</HI> and <HI>Pages</HI>
corrupted.</P>
<P>Part III. <HI>The Variety and Contrariety of the</HI> Popish
<HI>Bi∣bles, commonly called the</HI> Vulgar <HI>Bibles in</HI> Latin. Our
Au∣thor's Motives for publishing this Part were, first, because it is a
Matter of Faith to appoint what is Scripture, and what not, to shew that the
Pope may err in Matters of Faith. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI> <PB N="205" REF="232"/>
Because <HI>Papists</HI> object to us our different Translations of the
Bible, to shew their own gross Errors and Absurdities, in setting forth
their two <HI>Hierome</HI> Bibles, authoriz'd by two Popes within two Years.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> To vindicate his <HI>Bellum Papale,</HI> wrote against
those two discording Editions, from some Objections to the same, lately
publish'd by <HI>James Gretser.</HI> In this Part it further appears,
These Bibles were set forth by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> in 1590, and Pope
<HI>Clement</HI> 1592. And what Sentences or Words were <HI>added</HI> by Pope
<HI>Cle∣ment,</HI> which were not in the Edition of <HI>Sixtus:</HI> Also the
Sentences or Words <HI>left out</HI> by <HI>Clement,</HI> which were in the
Bibles of <HI>Sixtus</HI>; with the <HI>Contradictions</HI> of one against
the other: Errors in <HI>Numerical</HI> Computations; Transposition of
<HI>Names,</HI> and other Alterations of the Sense: To which follows, An
<HI>Apology</HI> or Defence of the <HI>Bellum Papale,</HI> pub∣lish'd by our
Author against those Bibles, 4to, 1600. In which he tells us, how he came
to engage himself against those Editions; recites the pompous
Inscription set up in the <HI>Vatican</HI> in Honour of <HI>Sixtus,</HI>
upon his said Publication, with the Apologies of some Jesuits for the
Errors therein; as <HI>Baldwin,</HI> Dr. <HI>Norrice,</HI> and Dr.
<HI>Bishop</HI>; also some Answers to <HI>Gretser</HI>'s Allegations
against our Author: With an Account of <HI>Arias Montanus</HI>'s
<HI>Apology,</HI> for his Integrity in setting forth the King's Bibles,
containing the whole History of his Trou∣bles in the Progress of that
costly Work; the Copy of which was found at the Sack of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and
by Dr. <HI>Rives</HI> reposited in the Library at <HI>Oxford</HI>; this with
a rehearsal of some Sen∣tences that are yet found uncorrected, or rather
added un∣warrantably to the Vulgar Bible; also some further Answers to
his Antagonist, and a Character of him, concludes this Part in 59 Pages.</P>
<P>Part IV. <HI>Of their condemning the Fathers.</HI> For tho' the
<HI>Papists</HI> do much boast of their Fathers, and vulgarly seem to
value their Writings, yet it is found that none are more injurious to their
Works or their Worth, 
<Q REND="inline">"using them as Mer∣chants do their casting
Counters; sometimes they stand for Pounds, sometimes for Shillings,
sometimes for Pence, sometimes for nothing, according as they be next and
readiest at Hand to make up their Accounts."</Q> In this Part, our Author
acknowledges himself much indebted to the Second Part of the Dean of
<HI>Winchester</HI>'s Apology, and to <HI>Sam. Huberus</HI> in his
<HI>Anti-Bellarminus.</HI> And having proved these Assertions, he
proceeds, to lay open the Mystery and Abuses of the <HI>Indices
Expurgatorii;</HI> shews you the Original, <PB N="206" REF="233"/> Nature,
Use and Corruption of this <HI>Inquisition</HI>; the Offi∣cers,
Inquisitors, Commissaries, and Public Notaries, con∣cerned in these
<HI>Indices of Books to be forbidden, or purged from whatever impugned the
Church of</HI> Rome. And here he com∣mends the Treatise, written by
<HI>Gabriel Putherbeus, De tollendis Libris malis,</HI> 1549, as what has
discovered the Wickedness of their Bishops, Priests and Monks, better
than any Work our Author knows. In the latter end of this Part, we have a
<HI>Table of the Divinity</HI> Books, first set forth and approved, then
censured by <HI>Papists.</HI> This Catalogue contains 323 of their said
<HI>forbidden Books,</HI> which are often noted in what Parts they have been
purged: Among them there are some of our own Authors; as <HI>Alcuinus,</HI>
whose Book <HI>de Trini∣tate, ad Carolum Regem,</HI> printed in <HI>Bibl.
Patrum,</HI> is falsely by <HI>Sextus Senensis</HI> and others, attributed
to <HI>Calvin</HI>; tho' in∣deed their Names are one, by a
<HI>Metathesis</HI> and Change of the Letters. Whereas Copies of it, written
above 500 Years ago, were to be seen in the <HI>Prince's Library</HI> at St.
<HI>James's</HI> and elsewhere. St. <HI>Adhelm</HI> Bishop of
<HI>Sherburne</HI> has also incurred the <HI>Roman</HI> Censure; and the
<HI>Summes</HI> of <HI>Richard Fitz-Rauf,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Armagh,</HI>
against the <HI>Armenians,</HI> with his other Treatises, are caution'd
against, as printed Anno 1511, by <HI>Possevine</HI>; and in Bishop
<HI>Fisher</HI>'s Book <HI>de Fiducia Dei,</HI> the <HI>Papists,</HI>
finding some Points against them, have pretended it was printed by some
<HI>Heretic</HI> in his Name, and even by <HI>Calvin</HI> according to
<HI>Gregory Capuchine.</HI> A silly shift; for the Book was printed at
<HI>Cologn</HI> in 8<HI>vo</HI> 1556, shortly after his Death; and since
then no such Matter was ever heard, till of late Years. 
<Q REND="inline">"A very likely Matter (says our Author) that the
<HI>Papists</HI> wou'd suffer such a piece of Knavery to lie buried so
long. Again, what reason have <HI>Protestants</HI> to counterfeit such a
Book in a <HI>Papist</HI>'s Name? Seeing their <HI>Indices of Books
forbidden, and to be purged,</HI> do furnish us with a sufficient Number in
this kind; without any Labour of ours. So much the more are we kindly beholden
unto them, first for sending us unto the best <HI>Books,</HI> by their
<HI>Catalogue</HI> of Books prohibited, and secondly, for directing us unto
the best <HI>Places</HI> to be read in those Books, by their <HI>Indices
Expurgatorii.</HI>"</Q> Nay, <HI>Gildas Sapiens</HI> was not so
<HI>wise,</HI> as to see that his Works shou'd come to be censur'd at
<HI>Rome,</HI> for otherwise he wou'd to be sure have prevented them, and
retracted his Opinion. Much less cou'd <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Occham</HI>'s
<HI>Dialogues,</HI> his <HI>Works of</HI> 90 <HI>Days,</HI> and his
<HI>Writings</HI> against Pope <HI>John</HI> XXII. escape 
<PB N="207" REF="234"/> the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of <HI>Books forbidden:</HI>
Besides some others o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our
Countrymen in this Table also mentioned. At the End of which we have a little
Summary of the Uses thereof, under the Consideration of what <HI>Popes,
Patriarchs, Bi∣shops, Cardinals, Fathers, Saints, Martyrs,</HI> &amp;c.
<HI>Councils, Liturgies, Prayer-books, Bibles,</HI> &amp;c. are censur'd
therein; also by what degrees Books have been corrupted; with what
Opposition; the Inquisitors being still at odds with us and themselves;
what <HI>Popish</HI> Authors, through all Ages, have maintained the Truth of
our Religion; what Books and Editions are to be read by Protestants:
lastly, what is con∣stantly denied by the Papists, That the Text of the
Fa∣thers Works is commanded to be purged in their several <HI>Indices
Expurgatorii,</HI> and plainly proved in this <HI>Table,</HI> by the Mark of a
Hand in the Margin. In this Table, our Author doubts not but many Writers have
slipped his Pen, Wherein he desired not Exactness, but to give you a
Taste only of that sour Fruit, which they have grafted upon o∣ther Mens
Stocks. He has cited nothing without a suffi∣cient Author or Authority. And
as for the Books of Law, Physick, and the Arts, which the Papists have thus
mangled and disfigured, they are reserved for some other time, this Part
ending at p. 102.</P>
<P>Part V. <HI>A Remedy against all Popish Corruptions.</HI>
Herein the Author shews how vain it is to find out the Diseases in Books,
without we endeavour to find out the Remedies also. This last Part,
containing 27 Pages, begins with an Account of the sundry Ways how Books are
depraved and corrupted, and three Ways proposed for reforming the same.
That the Discovery of false Treatises, in the Name of the Fathers, has in
part been made by the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> Dr. <HI>Reynolds,
Abraham Scultetus,</HI> and especially Master <HI>Robert Cooke</HI> of
<HI>Leedes.</HI> How the Corruption of the true Fathers is to be known; and
that those Places purged by the Inquisitors are to be restored as fast
by the Protestants. Of a Catechism to be framed for us out of their
Writings: and how Papists are to be answered by Papists. The Collations
of this kind by Mr. <HI>W. Crashaw,</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> commended.
How the <HI>Romish</HI> Falsifica∣tions might be shortly discovered, by
dividing the Exami∣nation among many Divines. The Profit of Collating prin∣ted
Books, with the <HI>Indices Expurgatorii.</HI> Their late cor∣rected Editions
to be considered and suspected. Of their pretended Discovery of lost
Writers in Caves, Mountains, <PB N="206" REF="235"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="207" REF="236"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="208" REF="237"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Popish Editions of the Fathers to be compared with
ancient MSS. How the Fathers Works were cor∣rupted before, and since
Printing; the Ways of correcting them. Our Universities and private Libraries
well stor'd with MSS. notwithstanding the great Consumption of them in
<HI>England.</HI> An Exhortation to private Men not to monopolize, but
communicate their MSS. seeing that how commendably soever they preserve
them, little Use can be made of them, nor their Authorities safely vouch'd,
since they are not always to be seen, while such Owners are liv∣ing; and,
when they die, may easily miscarry, by falling into the Hands of such as
regard them not; by whom, as one merrily said, <HI>Monyscripts</HI> are
more pored upon than <HI>Manuscripts.</HI> That the Neglect of the Fathers
has pro∣ceeded from the false Editions of them; and that there would be an
End of Controversy, if their Works were truly printed. An Objection from the
divers Readings of ancient MSS. Another against the Antiquity and Integrity
of Copies; with Answers. The Satisfaction of small Diffe∣rences in Copies.
Our <HI>English</HI> MSS. highly esteemed be∣yond Seas. Our Founders of
Colleges careful to furnish their Libraries with rare MSS. maintaining divers
Scholars abroad, to compare, transcribe, or procure Originals. That
<HI>Richard Dunelmensis,</HI> Founder of <HI>Duresme</HI> College, now
called <HI>Trinity</HI> College, bestowed many thousand Pounds <HI>per
Annum</HI> in Books, and most of his Books upon the Li∣brary he erected in
that College, who, for his exceeding great Love of Learning, did well deserve
the Name of <HI>Philo-biblos:</HI> See his Book, <HI>De Amore Librorum,</HI>
printed at <HI>Oxford</HI> 1598. <HI>De eo dictumerat, quod haberet plures
Libros quam omnes Pontifices in Anglia.</HI> Which Title and Character, since
his Time, is most justly to be given to Sir <HI>T. Bodley,</HI> whose
great Munificence has far surpassed the Bishop, hav∣ing stored his
Magazine, as our Author observes, with <HI>eleven</HI> or <HI>twelve
thousand Volumes</HI>; whereof the greatest part are in <HI>Folio,</HI> in
all Sciences and Languages, and fre∣quented by Scholars of all Nations. Here
follows the Con∣fession of his Adversaries, <HI>Possivine</HI> and
<HI>Costerus,</HI> of the Goodness and Plenty of our Books; the Way of
discern∣ing corrected Copies, and to know if they be ancient or not. That
those which are written in a set Hand, with great Letters, or in the
<HI>Lombard</HI> or <HI>Saxon</HI> Characters, are of great Antiquity; how far
later MSS. to be esteemed of. The Objection, that it is a tedious and
needless Work to <PB N="209" REF="238"/> collate the Fathers Works, with MSS.
answered. The Benefit likely to arise of a general Collation.
Commenda∣tions of Erasmus, and wherein defective, in his Animad∣versions
upon the Fathers Works. That he gave the first Alarm of their barbarous
corrupting the Fathers, for which his very Name is in <HI>Maledictione.</HI>
Exhortation to our wealthy Stationers to print the Fathers Works; such as Mr.
<HI>Geo. Bishop,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bonham Norton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John
Norton,</HI> who have been chosen Aldermen of <HI>London.</HI> That the
Charge of Printers and Stationers ought to be well recom∣pensed. They are
compared to our Merchants-Adventurers. Why, the Hazard being alike in most
Books, they should seek rather to deserve well of the ancient Fathers.
The Bible compared, revised, and printed this Year, 1611. St.
<HI>Chrysostom</HI>'s Works, with several other of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Fathers, likely to be printed at the unspeakable Charge of the learned and
judicious Provost of <HI>Eton</HI> College, and Warden of <HI>Mer∣ton</HI>
College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Savile,</HI> well seen in the
best Languages, and most of the Liberal Arts. The <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers,
more urged in all Controversies, should be the sooner correctly printed.
The Collation and Revision of the Fathers Works, a good Inducement to the
printing of them. The Use that is made of the MSS. indifferently, both by
Protestants and Papists; whereof, tho' much re∣mains to be spoken, our
Author, like a weary Traveller, here takes up his rest; which indeed he might
well need, having gone through such a Variety of Books, as this Work does
manifest; and really held it, as <HI>Baronius</HI> pretended to do, a
Religion, to say nothing which he could not prove, and to prove nothing but
out of certain, known, and sufficient Authors. At the End of his
<HI>Advertisement</HI> mentioned at the beginning, there is an
<HI>Appendix,</HI> shewing first, how there are Scribes diligently employ'd
in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Libra∣ry, to transcribe Acts of the Councils, or
Works of the Fathers; that they can imitate their Copies exactly; that it is
feared they alter and change at the Pope's pleasure; and that these
Transcripts in time may be vouched for ancient MSS. And this is more to be
feared, if there is an <HI>Index Expurgatorius</HI> for purging of MSS. as well
as printed Books. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the unknown Author of <HI>the Grounds
of the Old Religion, and the New,</HI> so often mention'd in this Work, is
now known to be one <HI>May,</HI> a Priest, a Man neither immodest nor
unlearned, yet foully mistaken in sun∣dry Points of his Answer to Mr.
<HI>Crashaw</HI>'s first <HI>Tome</HI> of, <PB N="210" REF="239"/>
<HI>Romish Forgeries and Falsifications.</HI> What we have lastly to

Free Power disputed, for the Disposition of his Lands, or other his
Fortunes, to his Son, Sons, or any one of them: As right</HI> Reason,
<HI>the</HI> Laws <HI>of God and Nature,</HI> the <HI>Civil, Canon</HI> and
<HI>Municipal Laws, of this Kingdom, do com∣mand.</HI> Quarto. <HI>Oxford,</HI>
1634. Pages 56.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS scarce Tract is dedicated by the Author to all
<HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Sons</HI> of <HI>worthy Families,</HI> whom Virtue,
Birth, and Learning, have justly stiled <HI>Gentlemen.</HI> And in the
said Address has these Asseverations; 
<Q REND="inline">"Not upon the least Presumption of a
Self-sufficiency to confront there∣by any received Custom (if any such
be) nor to dimi∣nish the natural Reverence due by <HI>younger Brothers</HI>
to their Elder, nor to enkindle Emulation in Families, nor to innovate any
thing to the Prejudice of public or pri∣vate Quiet (which none I hope will be
so ill-affected as to suppose) neither mine inoffensive Zeal for
younger Brothers, among who I am ranked one; nor the abso∣lute Consent of
Imperial and Ecclesiastical Laws, which I, having a little studied, not a
little respect; nor the particular Honour I bear to the Usages in this
Point of our ancient <HI>Britains,</HI> from whom I am descended; nor
desire to maintain and justify an Act in this kind, done by a Friend, whom
I must ever reverence; nor yet the hope of bettering my private Fortunes,
which moves Men much in these our Times, hath drawn me to this Undertaking:
But principally the singular Respect, which, as a Patriot, I bear to the
Glory and Good of <HI>Gentlemens Houses,</HI> whose best Original,
surest Means of Maintainance, and principal Ornament, is Virtue, or Force
of Mind; the want whereof is a common Cause of Ruin. The <HI>free Power</HI>
therefore of <HI>you,</HI> who are <PB N="211" REF="240"/> <HI>Fathers,</HI> is
here in some special Cases argued and de∣fended, to give you occasion
thereby to consider, with the clearer Eye-sight, for the Establishment
and Con∣tinuance of Families. Here also the natural Rights of <HI>us</HI>
that are <HI>Children,</HI> be so discoursed and discussed, as that
we <HI>younger Brothers</HI> may have Cause and Courage to endeavour, by
virtuous Means, to make ourselves, without the least wrong to any, capable,
if need shall be, of the chiefest Uses. And both and all, are so
handled, as that no Offence can reasonably arise in any respect, much
less for that the whole is conceived and written in Nature only of an
Essay or Probleme; to which I bind no Man to afford more Belief than
himself hath liking of, being free to refute the whole, or any part, at his
pleasure, as he feels himself able or disposed."</Q> In the
Conclusion of this <HI>Epistle,</HI> the Author observes, that nothing in
this <HI>Apology</HI> is defended but by Authority, Rea∣son, and Example, nor
any Person taxed, or particular personal Vices; nevertheless, if he has
not performed as well as he desires, or the Cause deserves, he hopes,
that for his good Intention he shall be conceived well of: and
sub∣scribes the two Letters of his Name, <HI>J. A.</HI></P>
<P>The Work is divided into <HI>ten Chapters,</HI> whereof the
first shews the Occasion of writing this <HI>Apology,</HI> to prove that
a Father may, in some Cases, make any of his Children his Heir, or freely
dispose his worldly Estate to which of his Sons he pleases, leaving to
the rest a Competency; and do an Act which may be just, according to the
Law of God, of Nature, and of Nations. The 2d Chapter maintains, That the
Grounds of all good Constitutions being in Nature, yet she neither before
nor after the Law of Propriety esta∣blish'd, did command that <HI>all</HI>
should be left to any <HI>one</HI> more than <HI>another:</HI> herein is
also shewn the happy <HI>Community</HI> of all things in the primitive
Ages; and that <HI>hereditary Succes∣sion</HI> or Title to Parents Lands or
Goods, was not in use till Nature came to be depraved. 3. That the Breach of
some written Laws of God, upon Warrant of the primary. Law of Nature, is
without Sin; and that therefore there can be no such Right in
<HI>Primogeniture,</HI> which is not in the Father's Power to avoid, tho' there
were a Precept to the contra∣ry, as there is not. 4. That Nations beginning to
devise sundry Forms of settling <HI>Inheritances,</HI> the
<HI>Romans</HI> especi∣ally therein respected the free Power of Fathers;
the Right of Children to their Fathers Estates, beginning only at 
<PB N="212" REF="241"/> their Father's Death. 5. That the present Custom of
our Country, of giving <HI>all,</HI> or <HI>almost all,</HI> to the
<HI>Eldest,</HI> was never so begun that it meant to exclude just Remedies
for such Evils, as should grow out of the Abuse of that Custom, when it
may make Fathers guilty of their Sons Faults, and of their Families Ruin. 6.
That it is no Offence before God, for a Father, being Tenant in
<HI>Fee-simple,</HI> to disinherit the Eldest, or to parcel his Estate
upon Cause; and that extream Vices of <HI>Heirs apparent,</HI> together with
the fewer Means, which younger Brothers have now to live on than heretofore,
crieth out against the contrary Opinion. 7. That Fathers, being Tenants in
<HI>Fee-tail,</HI> may likewise with∣out Scruple of Conscience,
discontinue the <HI>State-tail</HI> upon Cause, and devise the same at
their reasonable Pleasure. 8. That <HI>Unthriftiness</HI> is one known
Name of many hidden Sins, and is alone a sufficient Cause of
<HI>Disinherison,</HI> proved by the Law of God and Man, 9. The main Points
of the Premises exemplified in divers particular Facts, as well of Princes as
of private Persons. 10. That the Law of na∣tural Equity and Reason, confirm
just <HI>Disinherison</HI>; and that the riotous Lives of eldest
Brothers deserve that vehe∣ment Increpation, with <HI>which</HI> the Author
closes up this Treatise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before we part with this
Subject, we shall here take the Opportunity we have, of referring to a couple
of scarce Tracts, more ancient than this above recapitulated, which have
some Parts or Chapters in them relating thereunto. The first is called
<HI>New∣nam's Nightcrow, a Bird that breedeth</HI> Braules <HI>in many</HI>
Families <HI>and</HI> Housholds: <HI>Wherein is remember'd that kindly and
provident Regard which</HI> Fathers <HI>ought to have towards their</HI> Sons;
<HI>together with a Disciphering of the injurious Dealings of some younger
sort of</HI> Stepdames. Quarto. 1590. Pages 50. This Pamphlet is dedicated to
<HI>Thomas Owen.</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Serjeant at Law, by the Au∣thor
<HI>John Newnam:</HI> Is divided into <HI>Two Parts,</HI> and each into five
Chapters, The first Part is concerning <HI>Fathers;</HI> shewing chiefly
how the Virtues or Vices of their <HI>Children</HI> proceed most∣ly from
their Examples. And the second Part, upon <HI>Step-mothers,</HI> ends with
two Chapters under these Titles, <HI>That disinheriting of the</HI>
eldest Son, <HI>without very great</HI> lawful Cause, <HI>is an Act very
wrongful and ungodly. That Procurers and Counsellors of Disinhe∣rison,
and all wrong doing, ought to make or procure Restitution.</HI> But as
strong Arguments as there are herein, against the disin∣heriting of
Heirs, tho' several Crimes are produced, which they being convicted of, it is
allowed; yet they seem match'd in that other Pamphlet we mention'd, which is
a Dialogue, entitled, <HI>A Work worth the Reading: containing five Questions
very ex∣pedient, as well for</HI> Parents <HI>to perceive how to bestow
their</HI> Chil∣dren <HI>in</HI> Marriage, <HI>and to dispose their</HI>
Goods <HI>at their</HI> Death, <HI>as for all other Persons to receive great
Profit by the rest of the Mat∣ters herein expressed:</HI> Newly
published by <HI>Charles Gibbon,</HI> and <HI>dedicated</HI> to the Right
Worshipful Sir <HI>Nicholas Bacon.</HI> Q<SUP>o</SUP>. 1591. Pages 60. The second
Chapter of this Tract is upon the Question, <HI>Whether the Father may
lawfully disinherit his First-born</HI>; where, tho' there are Arguments
produced on both sides of the Question, yet we are induced to discard a
leud lavish Repro∣bate of an <HI>eldest Son,</HI> a riotous Spend-thrift,
which is a Charac∣ter less criminal than those produced by the former
Author, for a <HI>younger</HI> that is dutiful, virtuous, and prudent. For that

<Q REND="inline">"a wise Man will alter Custom after
Discretion, and dispose his Wealth according to Wisdom."</Q> And a
little further, 
<Q REND="inline">"Goods are the Gift of God; and he hath
appointed us not to do as we list with them, like <HI>Lords,</HI> but to
dispose them well as his <HI>Stewards:</HI> Therefore we ought to bestow
them on such, where he that gave them may be glorified;"</Q> according to the
A∣postle's Command, which is here cited. Thus much may suf∣fice in this
Place, if not to satisfy the Reader, yet to inform him where he may meet with
further Satisfaction upon a Subject of this important and universal
Concern.</NOTE>.</P>

<BIBL>SCOT's <HI>Discovery of</HI> WITCHCRAFT: <HI>Proving the

the Practices of</HI> Witchmongers, Conjurers, Inchanters, Soothsayers;

necessary to be known, for the undeceiving of</HI> Judges, Justices
<HI>and</HI> Juries; <HI>and for the Preservation of</HI> poor People,
&amp;c. <HI>With a Treatise also upon the Nature, &amp;c. of</HI> Spirits
<HI>and</HI> Devils, &amp;c. Quarto, 1651. Pages 401. be∣sides Tables,
&amp;c.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS curious Book so elaborately written upon these uncommon
Subjects, and first published by <HI>Reginald Scot,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
in 1584, as appears also in the Title-Page of this Edition, had for a while a
very good EfFect upon the <PB N="214" REF="243"/> Kingdom, in purging those
Dregs of Superstition, to which it seems naturally subject, by the
<HI>Paroxysms</HI> into which it has so frequently relapsed. <HI>James
Ady,</HI> M. A. in his <HI>Per∣fect Discovery of Witches,</HI> published in
4to. ten Years after this Edition of Mr. <HI>Scot</HI>'s Book now before us,
tells us, 
<Q REND="inline">"It did for some time take great Impression
in the Ma∣gistracy, and also in the Clergy; but since that time,
<HI>England</HI> hath shamefully fall'n from the Truth, which they begun to
receive."</Q> Further, it appears in the third Book of this Mr. <HI>Ady's
Discovery,</HI> which detects the <HI>Vanity</HI> of some <HI>English
Writers</HI> concerning <HI>Witches,</HI> and principally that
<HI>Dialogue</HI> of King <HI>James</HI>'s, called <HI>Demonologie,</HI>
first printed at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> 4to. 1597. that the said King has, in
the <HI>Preface</HI> thereof, chiefly objected to this Work of <HI>Scot</HI>'s;
wherefore, the Reader might expect in the Body of his Majesty's Pamphlet, to
find our Author notably confuted; but in reading that <HI>Dialogue,</HI> he
shall not find one thing or other answered, but only a bare Affirmation of
such Tenets, without Ground, or Warrant of Scripture, which were confuted by
<HI>Scot</HI>; as the Tenets of <HI>Bodin, Hyperius, Hemin∣gius,</HI> and other
Popish Writers; which might yet bring a Discredit upon <HI>Scot</HI>'s
Book, in those Understandings which are to be dazled by Names that glare
with great Titles or Dignities; but with discerning and unbiass'd Judges,
an Antagonist of such Character and such Conduct, will but raise the
Credit of the Works he opposes. All we have further to premise of our
Author, is from <HI>A. Wood,</HI> who informs us, That he was the younger Son
of Sir <HI>John Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots-Hall,</HI> near <HI>Smeeth</HI> in
<HI>Kent</HI>; that he was bred at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and 
<Q REND="inline">"gave himself up solely to solid Reading; to
the Perusal of obscure Authors, that had, by the genera∣lity of Scholars,
been neglected."</Q> And at Times of leisure, to Husbandry and Gardening, as
may appear from his <HI>Perfect Platform of a Hop-Garden,</HI> which was the
first Treatise that had been written upon this Subject, and from this
<HI>Discovery of Witchcraft,</HI> which also he seems to have 
<PB N="215" REF="244"/> first detected, publickly at least, in our Nation.
In both 
<Q REND="inline">"our Author plainly appears to have been well
versed in many choice Books, and that his search into them was so
profound, that nothing slipt his Pen which might make for his
Purpose."</Q></P>
<P>As to this Work, now under our Inspection, there are Three
ingenious Epistles, publish'd by our Author before it. Two of them, to Sir
<HI>Roger Manwood,</HI> Lord Chief Baron of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and to Sir
<HI>Thomas Scot</HI>; and the third, to Dr. <HI>Coldwell,</HI> Dean of
<HI>Rochester,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Readman,</HI> Arch∣deacon of
<HI>Canterbury.</HI> Then follows his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the
<HI>Reader</HI>; in which he solemnly professes, his Drift in this
Undertak∣ing was, That the Power and Glory of God shou'd not be abridg'd or
abased; that Religion might stand without the Trumpery of such
Impostures; and that Compassion might be used towards those poor
ignorant Souls, who are com∣monly accused, and sometimes credulously
confess them∣selves guilty of Witchcraft. At the End of this Epistle,
there is a <HI>Table</HI> of between two and three Hundred Authors used in
the ensuing Work, which is divided into <HI>Sixteen Books,</HI> and they into
many Chapters; beginning with an Im∣peachment of the Power of Witches in
Meteors, and Ele∣mentary bodies, tending to the Rebuke of such as attri∣bute
too much unto them. So proceeds in the next Chap∣ter, to the Inconvenience
growing by Men's Credulity here∣in, and a Reproof of some Churchmen inclined
to the common Opinion of Witches Omnipotency, with a familiar Example thereof,
in the Story of <HI>Margaret Simons</HI> of <HI>Brenchley</HI> in
<HI>Kent,</HI> who being accused of Witchcraft, by <HI>John Ferral</HI> Vicar
of that Parish, was arraign'd in 1581 at <HI>Rochester</HI>; but one of the
Jury being wiser than the rest, she was acquit∣ted. Next we have a
Description of those who are called Witches, the Motives to their being
thought and thinking themselves Witches. What miraculous Acts are imputed to
them, by Witchmongers, Papists and Poets. Confutations of the Opinion of
Witchcraft, and the Sin of repairing to <HI>Witches</HI> for help; how their
Name became so famous, and how variously People think of them. Causes why
<HI>Witches</HI> themselves, as well as others, believe they can work
Impossi∣bilities, with Answers to certain Objections, where also their
Punishment by Law is touch'd, and some late credulous Pub∣lications
reflected on. This Book concludes with an Ar∣raignment of the Cruelties
practis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon old Women in all 
<PB N="216" REF="245"/> Ages, since the Commencement of Popery, by
Witch∣mongers and Inquisitors.</P>
<P>The Second Book shews what infamous Witnesses are allowed to
give Evidence against reputed Witches, and upon what hard Conditions to be
challeng'd; as <HI>James Sprenger,</HI> and <HI>Henry Institor,</HI> from
whom <HI>Bodin,</HI> and other Cham∣pions of Witchmongers receive their Light,
allow. Next follows, the Order of their Examination, with an Account of the
<HI>Scottish</HI> Customs of accusing Witches, and King
<HI>Chil∣debert</HI>'s cruel Device. Matters of Evidence against them. Their
Confessions. Presumptions whereby they are con∣demned. Interrogatories by
the Inquisitors. Their super∣stitious Trial of Tears; their Cautions and
Tortures to pro∣cure Confession. The fifteen Crimes laid to their charge;
refuted. <HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI>'s Pleadings for an old Woman condemn'd of
Witchcraft. That it is no wonder Witches condemn themselves, thro' the
Barbarities used in extorting their Confessions.</P>
<P>The Third Book lays open the Bargains charged upon these reputed
Witches with the Devil, by several Popish Witchmongers here mention'd; with
the Order of their Homage to the Devil: Their Songs, Dances, Excourses,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their Summons to appear before the Devil; riding in the Air,
Conferences, Supplies, Sacrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That there can be no real
League made with the Devil, with the weak Proofs of the Adversaries for the
same. Of the private League with the Devil. <HI>Bodin</HI>'s fabulous Miracle
of the <HI>French</HI> Lady, transported from <HI>Lions</HI> to
<HI>Lorrain</HI> by an Oint∣ment. A Disproof of their Assemblies and
their Bargains. A Confutation of the Objection concerning Witches
Con∣fessions. What folly it were for Witches to undergo such de∣sperate
Peril and intolerable Tortures for the little Gain and great Disappointments
they meet with; and how it comes to pass they are overthrown by their
Confessions. How Melancholy abuses old Women, and the Effects thereof in
sundry Examples. That voluntary Confessions may be un∣truly made, tho' to
the undoing of the Confessors, and of the strange Operation of
Melancholy, proved by a late In∣stance, in the story, of <HI>Ade Davie</HI>
of <HI>Sellenge</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> O∣ther strange Effects of Melancholy;
that it frequently a∣bounds in old Women, and that their Confessions are
not to be credited. Confutations of their Confessions, concern∣ing their
League, and causing of Tempests. What wou'd be the Consequence if their
Confessions were true. Exam∣ples <PB N="217" REF="246"/> of credulous
People, who used Witches in the Wars. Of the <HI>Eye-biting</HI> Witches in
<HI>Ireland</HI>; of those pretend∣ed to ryme Man or Beast to death; and of
inchanted Ar∣chers, particularly a poor Fellow at <HI>Malling</HI> in
<HI>Kent,</HI> who by one of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Justices was punish'd,
for shooting with Flies, or Familiars, or inchanted Arrows, because he
cou'd win two or three Shillings a-day at the Butts. Autho∣rities condemning
the Confessions of Witchcraft, with the Attempts of a Popish Doctor to
disprove the same. The Rea∣sons also of Witchmongers, to prove the
Wonder-Workings of these old Women: <HI>Bodin</HI>'s Tale of the
<HI>Frieseland</HI> Priest transported; and the further Illusions of
melancholy Ima∣ginations. Of the Sufficiency of Witches Confessions in Law
to take away Life, with the Decrees of Divines and Coun∣cils in the Case.
Answers to the four Capital Crimes ob∣jected against Witches. The Author's
Request that his chaste Readers wou'd overlook Eight Chapters in the
fol∣lowing Book, reciting some lewd Feats ascribed to Witches by Doctors of
Popish Divinity; with his Apology for the same, as necessary to be
detected.</P>
<P>The Fourth Book exposes the presumptuous Opinions of
Witchmongers, in ascribing the superior Power to evil Spi∣rits, of framing
themselves in more excellent sort than God has made us; with their absurd
Assertions of the incongru∣ous Conjunctions of Witches with
<HI>Incubus</HI>; that since the Year 1400, they have consented willingly
to the Carnal Embraces of this Diabolical Phantom, and that many Witches burn'd
at <HI>Ravenspurge,</HI> confessed such Carnal Knowledge for many Years
together; with many other Te∣nets of the said unaccountable Intercourse,
most grossly un∣philosophical, and improbable to have met with the
Recep∣tion they have done among the most Ignorant; such as the Devil's
visible Dealings with Women in this kind, the Pow∣er of Witches to obstruct
Generation, and their supernatu∣rally depriving Men of the <HI>Paris</HI>
thereof. The Legend of St. <HI>Sylvanus</HI> personated by <HI>Incubus,</HI>
and of St. <HI>Christina,</HI> who charitably supplying the Place of a
Female oppress'd with one, was shrewdly accloy'd: Also another ridiculous
Legend of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> with the Tradition of yellow-hair'd Maids being
most encumber'd with <HI>Incubus</HI>; and the be∣witchery of married Men, to
use other Mens Wives in∣stead of their own: how to procure the
dissolving of be∣witched Love, and enforce Men to love old Hags; with the
relation of a lewd Trick of a Priest in <HI>Gelderland.</HI> In∣stances 
<PB N="218" REF="247"/> of divers Saints, very letcherously disposed and
mi∣raculously render'd chaste. A recital of certain Popish and Magical
Cures for those who are bewitch'd in their Privi∣ties, among which we have
the wise distinction of <HI>Hostiensis,</HI> between Frigidity and
Witchcraft; also Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>'s Receipt to procure Generation
mention'd, but not recited even in <HI>Latin,</HI> as the former is; being too
gross in our Au∣thor's mind for Repetition. This Chapter concludes with the
pious Offering made by <HI>Katharine Loe,</HI> of a waxen Re∣semblance of the
Parts affected in her impotent Husband, at the Altar of St. <HI>Anthony</HI>
for his Recovery. After these, and the Narrative of another Cure performed on
a Hag-rid∣den Mass-Priest, from the Account of <HI>Jason
Pratensis;</HI> This Book concludes with a Confutation of these Follies
touching <HI>Incubus</HI> and <HI>Succubus,</HI> shewing them to be nothing
but Popish Imposture and Knavery, to cover the shameful Debaucheries of
the <HI>Ecclesiasticks</HI> and their <HI>Concubines:</HI> That <HI>Robin
Goodfellow</HI> was nothing but a lusty cosening Frier; and that there can
be no Carnal Copulation with Spirits, much less any Offspring therefrom,
whatever <HI>Hyperius,</HI> and other such Deceivers write of our
<HI>Merlin:</HI> That <HI>Incu∣bus</HI> is a natural Disease, and of the
Remedies prescribed for the same; with the Derision which
<HI>Chaucer,</HI> who had seen through these <HI>Popish</HI>
Abominations, long since made of the Priests, under that Name, quoted from
his own Verses in the <HI>Wife of Bath</HI>'s Tale.</P>
<P>The Fifth Book lays open and confutes with many Ar∣guments and
Authorities, the absurd Accounts of <HI>Transfor∣mations</HI> by Sorcery,
into Wolves, Asses, Cats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An∣swers the Witchmongers
Objections concerning <HI>Nebuchad∣nezzar,</HI> with their Error relating to
<HI>Lycanthropia</HI>; and answers also their Arguments for
<HI>Transportation,</HI> and from the Calamities of <HI>Job</HI>; concluding
with the several sorts of Witches mention'd in the Scriptures, and how the
word Witch is there apply'd.</P>
<P>The Sixth Book begins with an Exposition of the <HI>He∣brew</HI>
Word <HI>Chasaph,</HI> wherein is answer'd that Objection in <HI>Exodus,
Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live</HI>; also of <HI>Si∣mon Magus</HI>
in <HI>Acts</HI> 8. An Explanation also of that Place in
<HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> wherein are recited all kind of Witches, with a
Confutation of their Opinions, who hold they can work such Miracles, as are
imputed to them. Observations upon the Use of Poison, by Women in all
Ages more than Men. Of divers Practitioners with Poison in many Coun∣tries, 
<PB N="219" REF="248"/> called <HI>Veneficia.</HI> A great Objection answer'd
con∣cerning this kind of Witchcraft called <HI>Veneficium.</HI> What
Confections used therein. Of Philtres, or Love-Potions, and the same
confuted by Poets. Proofs that such Potions rather promote Death tbro' their
Venom, than Love by Art; with a recital of many simple Ingredients, on which
this Power is imposed. And this Chapter concludes, with <HI>Bodin</HI>'s
Charge of false <HI>Greek,</HI> and false Interpretation there∣of,
against <HI>John Wier,</HI> retorted upon himself.</P>
<P>The Seventh Book begins with explaining the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word
<HI>Ob</HI> in the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> translated <HI>Pytho</HI> or
<HI>Phyoni∣cus Spiritus</HI>; which <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word signifying most
properly a Bottle, is there used because the <HI>Pythonists</HI> spake
<HI>hollow,</HI> as in the bottom of their Bellies, whereby they are aptly in
<HI>Latin</HI> call'd <HI>Ventriloqui</HI>; of which sort was <HI>Elizabeth
Barton</HI> the <HI>Holy Maid of Kent,</HI> &amp;c. by which Faculty they many
times overthrow the good Fame of honest Per∣sons. But our Author
passing over a hundred Cosenages he cou'd recite of this kind; does here
give us a large and true Story of a Wench named <HI>Mildred Norrington,</HI>
practi∣sing her diabolical Witchcraft by this <HI>Ventriloquy, Anno</HI>
1574, at <HI>Westwell</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> six Miles from his own
House; with the Account of her detection before two discreet Ju∣stices,
named <HI>Thomas Wotton</HI> of <HI>Bocton Malherb,</HI> and <HI>George
Darrel,</HI> Esqs; Here, says our Author, compare this Wench with the Witch
of <HI>Endor,</HI> and you shall see that both the Cosenages may be done
by one Art. The Discovery also of other such Deceivers, as <HI>Agnes
Brigs,</HI> and <HI>Rachel Pinder</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who disgorged
Pins, Clouts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the <HI>Dutch∣man</HI> at
<HI>Maidstone,</HI> named <HI>John Stiklebow,</HI> who was
dispossess'd of Ten Devils in 1572, according to the Pamphlet then
printed. The Abuses of <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Oracle; the Apostle's mis∣take
of Spirits, with Arguments that they can assume no Shapes. Further of
<HI>Apollo</HI>'s Witches call'd <HI>Pythonists,</HI> and of
<HI>Gregory</HI>'s Letter to the Devil, with a Comparison be∣tween the Idol
of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and our Rood of Grace, thro' the help of little St.
<HI>Rumbal</HI> at <HI>Boxly</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> How many learned Men have
been deluded in their Writings upon this Subject of Spirits. More of the Witch
of <HI>Endor,</HI> and that <HI>Samuel</HI> was not raised indeed; the Dotage
of <HI>Bodin</HI> and o∣ther <HI>Papists</HI> herein, and that Souls cannot
be raised by Witchcraft. That neither the Devil nor <HI>Samuel</HI> were
rais∣ed; but that it was a mere Trick according to the Guise of our
<HI>Pythonists.</HI> Answers to the Objections of our Witch∣mongers 
<PB N="220" REF="249"/> in this Case. Expositions of the Places in
Scrip∣ture, shewing how <HI>Saul</HI> was abused, and how it might all be
wrought by <HI>Ventriloquy.</HI> With other Opinions produced and answer'd,
tending to prove that our Miracles are com∣monly Knaveries, and especially of
the Priests; that since <HI>Luther</HI>'s Time these Spirits, Hags,
Fairies, Imps, Incubi, Robin Goodfellows, Men in the Oak, Puckles, Fire-drakes,
Hobgoblins, Tom-thumbs, and all the rest of this Black Brood of Bull-beggars,
have much vanish'd and very little appear'd; and lastly, that those who
will credit the Stories of Witches, must allow as much to their Power of
working Miracles, as to that of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The Eighth Book shews us how Miracles, the Gift of Prophecy, and
Oracles are ceased; with a recital of <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI>'s Tale, believed by
many learned Men, of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s <HI>Death</HI>; and another out of
the <HI>Golden Legend</HI> of a <HI>godly Devil.</HI> The Judgment of the
Fathers upon Oracles, and their Abolishment, with their Transplantation
from <HI>Del∣phos</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI>; also where, when, and how the

<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Ninth Book expounds the word <HI>Kasam</HI> or Divi∣nation;
proves from Scripture the Lawfulness of making Ob∣servations on the
Weather; that of other Observations, some are Indifferent, some
Ridiculous, and some Impious. Fur∣ther of the Idol of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and
the ancient <HI>Aruspices.</HI> Of the Predictions of Soothsayers, and Lewd

Causes and Effects. The variance of old Writers touching Dreams. Against

<HI>Hemingius</HI> his diabolical Dreams, and that Witches nor any other can
impose upon sleeping Men what Cogitations they list. The Cause of
Magical or rather frightful Dreams. How Men <PB N="221" REF="250"/> have been
deluded by Dreams to dig for Money, with the Order and Ceremony used therein;

for the Transportation of Witches; with a Con∣futation of these Follies,

<HI>Old Testament</HI> were mostly revealed in Dreams, and that such
Revelations are not now to be look'd for. Of some Dreams coming to pass,
others proving contrary, and <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s Rule to know a true
Expositor of them.</P>
<P>The Eleventh Book begins with the Exposition of <HI>Nahas,</HI>
or the flying of Birds called <HI>Augury,</HI> so passes to the
<HI>Jewish</HI> Sacrifice to <HI>Moloch,</HI> with an Argument against
Purgatory. The Cannibal Custom of the <HI>Popish</HI> Sacrifice in the

other Superstitions, e∣specially by the common People. The variance of old
Wri∣ters upon this Art; wherefore it is ridiculous; derided by <HI>Cato,
Aristotle,</HI> &amp;c. Of the silly Distinctions made thereof. Of
<HI>Figure-flingers,</HI> and the Uncertainty of their Art. The Sentence of
<HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI> against judicial <HI>Astrology.</HI> The

these <HI>Genethliacs</HI> or Nativity-Casters.</P>
<P>The Twelfth Book treats of Inchantments from the <HI>Hebrew</HI>
Word <HI>Habar.</HI> In what Sense Words may be al∣low'd as <HI>Charms.</HI>
What is forbidden in Scripture concern∣ing Witchcraft. The Superstition of
the <HI>Cabilists</HI> and <HI>Pa∣pists.</HI> The Offence of Charms, and
what wou'd follow, if the Effects ascribed to them were true. Why God forbade
the practice of Witchcraft. The Absurdity of the Law of the Twelve Tables,
whereon their Estimation in miraculous Actions is grounded. An Instance of
one arraign'd upon the Law of those Tables; where the said Law is proved
ridicu∣lous. <PB N="222" REF="251"/> Laws for the Punishment of Witches that
work Mi∣racles, and of <HI>Popish</HI> Laws against them. A Recital of the
Poetical Authorities alledg'd by Witchmongers for the Proof of Witches. A
Collection of <HI>Popish</HI> Tablets, Amulets, Charms, Agnus Dei,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> against Diseases, Casualties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How to
make Holy Water, with several other Receipts, and the Opinion of
<HI>Ferrarius</HI> touching them: Of <HI>Homerical</HI> Me∣dicines, and
several other <HI>Popish</HI> Charms for Man and Beast, especially for
the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI>'s Horse, which was conse∣crated or canoniz'd in
the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> at the solemn Mass; wherein the Pope's Bull and
his Charm was publish'd, the Duke sitting as Viceroy with his consecrated
Standard in his Hand, till the Solemnity was over. Several Accounts of the
charming of Serpents, Snakes, <HI>&amp;c. Mahomet</HI>'s Pidgeon, the tractable
Ass at <HI>Memphis,</HI> with many other Instances of Charms, particularly
with <HI>waxen Images</HI>; whereby the Im∣postures of Mother <HI>Baker,</HI>
a famous <HI>Kentish</HI> Witch, were discover'd. Several Receipts used
of old, to make Charms, as St. <HI>Adelbert</HI>'s against Thieves, the
Pope's Incantation in 1568, to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for Success in the
<HI>Low-Country</HI> Wars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ending with a Confutation of the
Virtues falsely ascribed to such Charms and Amulets, by ancient
Writers.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth Book opens with explaining the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word
<HI>Hartumim</HI> or Natural Magic, and shews how the Antients travell'd for
the Knowledge thereof. Of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Knowledge therein, the
distinction thereof, and why it is condemn'd for Witchcraft. That this Study
teacheth only the Works of Nature: What wonderful Effects are disco∣ver'd by
it in Waters, Precious Stones, with the Use there∣of by Magicians; the
Sympathy and Antipathy of Natural and Elementary Bodies, particularly of two
notorious Won∣ders not marvell'd at. The one a Piece of Earth which would fly
the hot Steel with great swiftness, and pursue Gold as fast, with other
Properties more incredible; the other a strange Stone which wou'd shine
bright in the Dark, always labour'd to ascend, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the
former of these be∣ing found to signify a Man, the latter a Fire; our
Author applies the manner of Expression to that often used in Magic,
which sometimes consists as well in the deceit of Words as slight of
Hand; and this introduces the Illusions and Confe∣deracies here display'd
in the Art of <HI>Legerdemain.</HI> Here he observes the Admiration there was
at <HI>Brandon</HI> the Juggler, who by the Wounds and Words he used upon the
Picture of a <HI>Dove</HI> painted on the Wall, promised the King before 
<PB N="223" REF="252"/> whom he performed, perhaps <HI>Edward</HI> VI. it being
still in remembrance, that a live Dove then on the House-Top should fall
down dead; which it did accordingly: The Juggler was forbidden the Practice of
this Feat, as if he could murder any body so in Effigie, tho' the Mystery
being here revealed, he appeared not to have more dange∣rous Power than any
other body. We have here also many other of the Juggler's Tricks recited and
revealed. Obser∣vations on <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Magicians, a Comparison
between them and our Witches. Many strange Experiments by Glasses, and
the perspective Art. Remarks on the Feats of <HI>Jannes</HI> and
<HI>Jambres</HI>; also on <HI>Balaam</HI>'s Ass. But the Trick which was
called the <HI>Decollation</HI> of <HI>John Baptist,</HI> perform'd by one
<HI>Kingsfield,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> in 1582, was long practised with
great Surprize to the Spectators; as the League of <HI>Stephen Taylor</HI> and
one <HI>Pope,</HI> the one to steal Horses, and the other to discover
them, seems to have been with Pro∣fit to the Confederates. But the most
dexterous Fellow for <HI>Legerdemain,</HI> in our Author's Time, was <HI>John
Cauta∣res</HI> of St. <HI>Martin's</HI>; not that himself was a mean
Artist: for says he, 
<Q REND="inline">"If Time, Place, and Occasion serve, I can
shew so much herein, that, I am sure, <HI>Bodin, Spinaeus,</HI> and
<HI>Vairus</HI> would swear I were a Witch, and had a fa∣miliar Devil at
Commandment: But truly my Study and Travel herein, hath only been employed to
the end I might prove them Fools, and find out the Fraud of them that make them
Fools, as whereby they may become wiser, and God may have that which to him
belongeth."</Q> With this, and the Patters or Prints, of some juggling
In∣struments before-mentioned, our Author ends this Chapter.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth Book treats of the Craft of Alchemy, re∣cites
<HI>Chaucer</HI>'s Character and Opinion of Alchemists, and their Terms of
Art. Their Pretensions by the Philoso∣phers Stone and Waters, with other
Characters, and De∣tections of them, by <HI>Chaucer</HI> in his
<HI>Chanon</HI>'s Yeoman's Tale. Several Stories of Persons cousened by
Alchemists, among the rest, that of <HI>Erasmus</HI> in his
<HI>Colloquies.</HI> The Opinion of some learned Men touching the Folly of
Al∣chemy, as <HI>Avicenna, Petrarch, &amp;c.</HI> That vain and de∣ceitful Hope
is the Cause of Delusion hereby, ending with the Story of the Courtier, who
gave King <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. a fine Horse, because his Majesty had given
a Peasant (who had of∣ten entertained him in his Hunting Diversions) a
thousand <PB N="224" REF="253"/> Crowns for a Turnip; in hopes of a
proportionable Re∣ward, but received the Countryman's Present for his
own.</P>
<P>The fifteenth Book having shewn the Significations of the Word
<HI>Jidoni,</HI> a sort of Conjurers, whom our Author calls No small Fools,
as not going to work with a Toad or a Cat, as Witches do, but with a kind of
Majesty call up by Name, and have at Command, no less than seventy-nine
principal and princely Devils, who have under them, as their Ministers, many
Legions of petty Devils: and we have here a List of all their Names, with an
Account of their Shapes, Powers, Government, their several Segnio∣ries, and
Degrees: The Work of one <HI>T. R.</HI> in 1570. Where∣unto is joined, the
Hours wherein it is pretended, that the principal Devils may be bound or
raised, and restrained from doing hurt. After which follows a Confutation
of the manifold Vanities in these Accounts, and of the Pre∣dictions derived
from the planetary Aspects and Motions; whereof we have here several
Tables, with their Characters. The Forms used in the pretended Conjurations of
the Spirits of dead Persons, and for finding hidden Treasures. The
Con∣juration of the three Fairy Sisters for the Ring of Invisibi∣lity, and
for the enclosing of Spirits in a Crystal Stone; with Types or Figures
explaining the same. The Receipt for making of Holy-water; Compacts with
departing Per∣sons to appear, and be bound, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then follows a
Con∣futation of this kind of Conjuration of raising, binding, and
dismissing of the Devil, going invisible, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into which
the Assassine was deluded, who murdered the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
1582. Also an Observation, that the chief Authors among us of those
Conjurations were <HI>T. R.</HI> before-menti∣oned, and <HI>John Cokers.</HI> A
Comparison between Popish Exorcists and Conjurers. The Detection of a
late cousening Conjuration practised at <HI>Orleans</HI> by the
<HI>Franciscans.</HI> Who may be Conjurers in the <HI>Romish</HI> Church,
besides Priests; a ridiculous Definition of Superstition. Why there were
no Conjurers in the Primitive Church; and that it is more difficult to conjure
the Devil out of one bewitched, than one possessed; with many other
absurd Distinctions. Some Conjurations taken out of the Pontifical and out
of the Missal. The Rules of Popish Exorcists, and other Con∣jurers, all
one; and how St. <HI>Martin</HI> conjured the Devil. That it is a shame for
Papists to believe other Conjurers Doings, their own being of so little
force; with <HI>Hippocra∣tes</HI>'s Opinion of the Art. How Conjurers have
beguiled <PB N="225" REF="254"/> Witches. What Books they carry about to procure
Credit-Wicked Assertions by the Ancients against <HI>Moses</HI> and
<HI>Jo∣seph.</HI> All magical Arts confuted, by an Argument con∣cerning
<HI>Nero.</HI> What <HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI> and <HI>Carolus Gallus</HI> have
left written thereof, and proved by Experience. Of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Conjurations from <HI>Josephus, P. Lombard, Grati∣an, Durandus,</HI> and the
Lessons of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church upon St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s Day.
Those Lessons translated, and a ridicu∣lous Story of that St.
<HI>Margaret</HI> cited. Some other Popish Mi∣racles. Of Visions, Noises,
Apparitions and imagin'd Sounds; wandering Souls, and other Illusions, with a
Confutation thereof. <HI>Cardan</HI>'s Opinion of strange Noises; how
coun∣terfeit Visions grow into Credit. Of <HI>Boniface</HI> his Knavery in
counterfeiting a Voice from Heaven, by which he got the Popedom of his silly
Predecessor <HI>Coelestinus.</HI> Of Echos, and <HI>Cardan</HI>'s odd
Story or a Man who was near being drowned by one; and of the strange Noise
at <HI>Winchester,</HI> which was so much wondered at about 1569, tho'
indeed a meer natural Noise engendered by the Wind and other concurring
Causes. Of <HI>Theurgy,</HI> or working by good An∣gels, with the appendent
Arts, and the Rejection thereof, as altogether papistical and
superstitious; more particularly exposed in a Letter here recited, which
was sent to our Author by <HI>T. E.</HI> Master of Arts, Practiser both
of Physick, and also, in times past, of certain vain Sciences, for which
he was now, 1582, in Prison, and condemned to die. In this Letter, it is
confessed by the Writer of it, that in twenty-six Years practice of
these secret Arts, and converse with those most familiar in them, he
could meet with no∣thing true as pretended, or supernatural Performance, but
that it was all Imposture and Delusion; and recommends a Book written in
the old <HI>Saxon</HI> Tongue, by one Sir <HI>John Malborne,</HI> a Divine of
<HI>Oxenford,</HI> three hundred Years past, detecting the Devices of
Conjuration, or opening all the Illusions and Inventions of these Arts and
Sciences; which Book this Letter-writer had left with the Parson of
<HI>Slang∣ham</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI>; where, he tells our Author, if he
would send for it in his Name, he might have it: But tho' he did send, and
used the Interest of Men of Worship and Credit, particularly of the
Knight of the Shire, who would have passed his word for the Restitution,
yet such was the Folly and Superstition of this Parson, that he would not
lend it for our Author's Perusal. But, in truth, he had so
indus∣triously stored himself with other <HI>Authorities</HI> and
<HI>Intelli∣gences,</HI> <PB N="226" REF="255"/> that he appears to have little
needed those which this Book might have afforded; insomuch, that whatever
lay clouded or shadowed in the Face of Truth, by this frightful Grey-Beard of
Superstition, seems here discovered by the Light of those Authorities,
and that of Reason, ac∣cording to this ryming old Verse; 
<Q> 
<L>Quicquid Nix celat, Solis calor omne revelat.</L></Q></P>
<P>The sixteenth Book contains a Conclusion, in manner of an
Epilogue, repeating many of the former Absurdities of Witchmongers, with
Confutations thereof, and the Au∣thorities of <HI>James Sprenger</HI> and
<HI>Henry Institor,</HI> Inquisitors and Compilers of <HI>Malleus
Maleficarum;</HI> more particularly by what means the Vulgar have been brought
to believe in Witches; with a Definition and Description of Witchcraft.
Reasons to prove that their Charms, Characters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all
Fables, and that those who use, them are all Cheats; and from the
Confessions of the most notorious among them, more especially Mother
<HI>Bungie,</HI> who, in divers Books, set out with Authority, is
registered and chronicled, by the Name of the Great Witch of
<HI>Rochester</HI>; who, on her Death-bed, confessed, That her Cunning
consisted only in deluding and deceiving the People with some little
Skill in Physick, and the Assistance of a Friend, named <HI>Heron,</HI>
which was all the Spirit or Devil she had, whatever the World had been
imposed on to believe. Further Detec∣tions of these Knaveries in one so
bewitched, that he could read no Scripture but canonical, and a Devil that
could speak no <HI>Latin.</HI> Of the Divination by the Sieve and Sheers, and
by the Book and Key: <HI>Hemingius</HI> his Opinion thereof confuted, and many
other juggling Delusions. The Con∣sequences of believing in the Devil's
Transformation, or as∣suming of different Shapes, exemplified in the
Instances of Christ's Argument to <HI>Thomas</HI>; the Inhabitant of
<HI>Tigurie,</HI> ap∣pearing to be in wicked Dealings with a Mare, as
<HI>Lavater</HI> records; and the Story of Queen <HI>Cunegunda</HI> from
<HI>Crantzius,</HI> with her Purgation by the Fiery Ordeal, or <HI>Candentis
Ferri.</HI> After another idle Story expos'd, of the Devil preaching holy
Doctrine, in the shape of a Priest, and Arguments to shew what a shame
it is, after Confutation of the greater Witchcratfs, for any Man to give credit
to the lesser Points thereof, we have a general Conclusion against
those whom this Book concerns; which, with two or three Chapters upon natural
Witchcraft, or Fascination, bewitching Eyes for Hatred and for Love,
concludes the whole sixteen Book.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="256"/>Then follows a Discourse upon Devils or
Spirits; and first of Philosophers Opinions; also the Manner of their
reason∣ing hereupon, and the same confuted. Herein the Author proceeds to
shew how unsatisfactorily all Authors have writ∣ten upon this Subject;
particularly <HI>Psellus,</HI> whose absurd Assertions are here
exposed; as also <HI>Cardan</HI>'s about his Fa∣ther's Familiar Devil.
<HI>Plato</HI>'s Opinion of Spirits, and of <HI>So∣crates</HI>'s familiar
Devil. The nine Orders of Spirits and An∣gels, according to <HI>Plato</HI> and
<HI>Dionysius.</HI> The meaning of Arch∣angel, according to Mr.
<HI>Deering,</HI> our Author's Kinsman, in his Lecture upon the
<HI>Hebrews.</HI> The Commencement of Devils fondly gathered out of the 14th of
<HI>Isaiah.</HI> Of <HI>Lucifer</HI> and his Fall; the Opinion of the
<HI>Cabalists, Talmu∣dists</HI> and Schoolmen, of the Creation of Angels.
The Con∣tention between the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Church about the
Fall; and among the Papists. Enquiries where the Battle was fought between
<HI>Michael</HI> and <HI>Lucifer,</HI> how long it continued, and what their
Forces. Other fond Opinions about the fallen Angels, particularly among the
<HI>Rabbins,</HI> Reasons a∣gainst the Devil's Ugliness. That the Devil's
Assaults are spiritual, and how grossly some understand the
Scriptures herein. The Equivocation of the word Spirit, and how diversely
taken in the Scriptures. Of Christ's healing the Blind, and of those
possessed with Devils in the Gospel, or Lunacy, and other
Diseases. How the word Devil is to be understood, both in the singular
and plural Number. The Variation of Authors about Spirits and Souls. Popish
Opi∣nions of Spirits; of Day-devils, and Night-devils. That the Devils
mentioned in Scripture, have their Nature and Qualities in their Names, here
mentioned and interpreted. The Idols or Gods of the Gentiles distinguished.
Their <HI>Lares, Larvae, Manes, Daemones,</HI> and <HI>Virunculi Terrei,
&amp;c.</HI> such as was <HI>Robin Godfellow</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who
would supply the Office of Servants, specially of Maids; and
<HI>Hudgin,</HI> a very familiar and sociable Hobgoblin in <HI>Germany,</HI>
so called because he always wore a Cap or Hood; therefore our Author thinks
him a kind of <HI>Robin Hood;</HI> and that our Fryar <HI>Rush</HI> was
altogether such another Fellow, brought up in the same School, the Kitchen,
insomuch as the self-same Tale is written of one as the other, about the
Scullion said to have been slain, <HI>&amp;c</HI> for the reading whereof,
we are referred to Friar <HI>Rush</HI>'s Story, or else to <HI>John Wierus,
De praestigiis Daemonum.</HI> Further of the <HI>Romans</HI> chief Gods,
called <HI>Dii selecti;</HI> the various Gods in other Countries; of 
<PB N="228" REF="257"/> Popish provincial Gods, as St. <HI>George,</HI> St.
<HI>Andrew,</HI> &amp;c. A Comparison between them and Heathen Gods, where it
appears we have had as great Traitors, as great Whores, as great Quacks and
Impostors, among our sanctified and ca∣nonized Tribe, as the best of
them. And whereas our ancient Saints were Patrons only over some one Province
of Health, or had Power to cure only one Disease, nothing comes amiss to
our Moderns thro' the Omnipotency of Witchcraft, yea greater Matters ascribed
to their Powers, than to all other Saints; witness S. Mother <HI>Bongie,</HI>
S. Mother <HI>Paine,</HI> S. <HI>Feats,</HI> S. Mother <HI>Still,</HI> S.
Mother <HI>Dutton,</HI> S. <HI>Kytrell,</HI> S. <HI>Ursula Kemp,</HI> S.
Mother <HI>Newman,</HI> S. Doctor <HI>Heron,</HI> S. <HI>Rosimund,</HI> with
divers more, who deserve to be registered in the Pope's Kalendar, or the
Devil's Rubric. Then follows a Comparison between the Heathens and the
Papists, touching their Excuses for Idolatry. The Idolatry of the Council
of <HI>Trent.</HI> A notable Story of a Hangman arraign'd, after he was dead
and buried, taken from our Lady's <HI>Rosary</HI>; with a Confutation
thereof, and several o∣ther Tales. Of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI>
appearing in Mount <HI>Ta∣bor.</HI> A Confutation of assuming Bodies, and
of the Ser∣pent tempting Eve. Exposition of the Curse rehearsed,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 3. <HI>John Calvin</HI>'s Opinion of the Devil. Our Author's
Opinion of the Nature of Spirits, and of the Devil, with his Properties.
Against Witchmongers, and their idle Opi∣nions of Corporal Devils, and
particularly against <HI>Brian Darcie</HI>'s Distinction of Spirits, and
the Books published by <HI>W. W.</HI> and <HI>Richard Gallis</HI> of
<HI>Windsor.</HI> Then comes the <HI>Conclusion,</HI> wherein the Spirit of
Spirits is treated of, by the Illumination whereof, all Spirits are to be
tried; with a Confutation of the Pneumatomachi, denying the Divinity thereof;
which, with a Summary of the Chap∣ters, concludes the whole Book.</P>

Rulers and Governors, in Church and State. Also an excellent Diyscourse
of the Isle of</HI> MAN. Fol. 1656<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus the common

Historical and Geographical of the County Palatine of</HI> Chester,
<HI>illustrated with divers Figures cut in Copper, and publish'd by</HI>
Daniel King <HI>of</HI> Chester, 1656. 'Tis inviron'd with Branches forming
an Oval, containing the Arms of all the Earls of <HI>Chester,</HI> from
<HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> to <HI>Henry,</HI> eldest Son of King <HI>James</HI> I.
and on the Sides thereof, are two Standards supported by Wolves, and bearing
the Arms of the County; which are in one of them, 3 Wheat-Sheaves; and in the
other, a Wolf's Head eraz'd. As for this Publisher, <HI>Daniel King,</HI>
tho' <HI>Ant. Wood</HI> might receive a private Character of him from a noted
Author, in a Letter, intimating he was an igno∣rant and knavish Fellow, we
see not, with what Justice the same is published, in relation to this
Book. It is plain, that he commendably procured these Accounts of
<HI>Chester,</HI> which might never have seen the Light but for him; and
has faithfully pub∣lished them, justly ascribing every Part to its due
Owner; that he hath industriously adorned them with many Sculptures; has
assumed no part to himself but what was visibly his own, and was in
so much Credit with the Gentry of the County, that many of them were
evidently his Patrons, and Encouragers: wherefore we cannot but think rather
with Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> That seeing this <HI>Daniel King</HI> had, in his
Travels, got the Mystery both of <HI>Surveying</HI> and <HI>Engraving,</HI>
and used the same to enliven the <HI>Descriptions</HI> above, which he
set forth, with so many Cuts of <HI>Heraldry</HI> and <HI>Topography,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"That <HI>Cheshire</HI> is chiefly behold∣en

<P>THIS Collection is dedicated by the said <HI>Daniel King</HI> to

Editor, by his Cousin <HI>John King,</HI> en∣couraging the Publication in
hand thro' the Merits of his <PB N="230" REF="259"/> Labours therein. After
which, we have Verses in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> upon the

Preface to the Rea∣der, we learn, that the first Part of this Volume was the
Work of <HI>William Smith,</HI> long since <HI>Rouge-dragon,</HI>
Pursui∣vant at Arms, and communicated to him by Mr. <HI>Ranulph Crew,</HI>
Grandson to the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Crew,</HI> in whose hands the Copy
was left. The second, was the Work of Mr. <HI>William Webb,</HI> heretofore a
Clerk in the Mayor's Court at <HI>Chester</HI>; and this was imparted by that
great Lover of Antiquities, Sir <HI>Simon Archer</HI> of <HI>Tanworth</HI> in

the better Ornament of the whole; as also, thro' the help of some that were
Well-wishers thereto, A Translation of divers Foundation-Charters, with
other things of good Note. Then follows this Remark, 
<Q REND="inline">"That there is no County in <HI>England</HI> more
famous for a long-continued Succession <HI>of ancient Gentry</HI> than this
of <HI>Chester,</HI> will not be denied, nor any that can afford Materials
with so little Trouble and Charge, for the setting forth their
<HI>Descents</HI> and memorable <HI>Imployments,</HI> inso∣much as the
Substance of all public Records meerly re∣lating thereto, for almost 400
Years, are carefully pre∣served in the Castle at <HI>Chester</HI>; and
that the private Evi∣dences concerning the particular Families of that County,
are, by reason of their long Duration, less dispersed than those of
many others be thro' the great and frequent Changes that have befallen them in
most Places."</Q> But our Publisher, apprehensive, belike, that his
Authors, how∣ever they may have preserved many worthy Memorials, had not made
all the Advantage they might have done of those Records, 
<Q REND="inline">"hopes therefore, that these Essays of the
Persons <PB N="231" REF="260"/> above-mentioned, now coming to the View of the
World, will for the Reasons before express'd, considering the
Worthiness of the Subject, stir up such whose greater Abi∣lities may,
by a more exact Survey and Search into the Antiquities of this Shire,
contribute further to its Honour, by restoring to Light its ancient Glory,
for the more am∣ple Content of all Persons concerned therein, and their own
lasting Memory."</Q></P>
<P>After this Preface, we have the Publisher's Map of the County
Palatine of Chester, which Mr. <HI>Randolph Crew</HI> had drawn with a Pen.
Then begins the Work under the Title of, <HI>The Vale Royal of England,</HI>
with <HI>a Catalogue of the Kings of Mercia,</HI> or <HI>March</HI>; which
Kingdom in the <HI>Saxon Heptarchy</HI> reached from <HI>London</HI> to the
River of <HI>Marsey,</HI> which parts <HI>Cheshire</HI> from
<HI>Lancashire,</HI> containing seventeen Counties, and Part of two more.
This Catalogue contains 22 Kings, beginning <HI>Anno</HI> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5 with <HI>Crida,</HI> descended from
<HI>Woden,</HI> and ending in 886, with Ceolwolph. Next we have an Account,
gather'd, as the former seems to have been, from <HI>Fox, Holinshed,
Llhuyd, Camden,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>the Dukes and Earls of March,</HI> before
the Conquest, who were also Palatines of <HI>Chester</HI>; for that it
was a County Palatine before the Conquest, appears in the
<HI>Supplication</HI> here exhibited to King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. by the
Inhabitants there∣of; and also that they were, among other Privileges,
ex∣empted from the granting of Subsidies, appears by that King's
<HI>Answer</HI> thereunto. Then we have a Confirma∣tion of the
<HI>Liberties</HI> of the County Palatine by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> 1568,
with the Opinions of the Judges, <HI>Dier, Weston, Harper,</HI> and
<HI>Carns,</HI> concerning the Jurisdiction and Liberties of the said
County. Here we enter upon a par∣ticular <HI>Description</HI> of the County;
its Length about 44 Miles; Breadth about 25, and Compass 112 Miles; Num∣ber
of Market-Towns 11; Parish Churches 87; Longi∣tude 17 Deg. 30 Min. and
Latitude 53 Deg. 30 Min. with the reason, from its low Situation, of its
being named the Vale-Royal, by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. when he founded an Abbey
in the midst of the Shire. So we proceed to the Tempera∣ment of the Air, the
Fertility and Products of the Soil, a∣mong which the <HI>Salt-Wells</HI> are
not forgot; lastly of their Buildings, the Disposition of their People,
and their Man∣ner of House-keeping. Hence we pass to the Waters and their
Courses, beginning with the River <HI>Dee</HI>; so of the
<HI>Marsey,</HI> the <HI>Weaver,</HI> the <HI>Dane, Bollin, Peever,
Wheelock,</HI> <PB N="232" REF="261"/> <HI>Taume,</HI> and the <HI>Goit</HI>;
with others mentioned by <HI>John Le∣land,</HI> and <HI>W. Harrison.</HI>
Thus we come to the Particulari∣ties of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> that is, the
Divisions or <HI>Hundreds,</HI> into which the County is distinguished,
and they are seven. Of <HI>Weral,</HI> the first here mentioned, we have a
Description from <HI>Leland,</HI> and of <HI>Helbrie</HI> Island: Then
follow the Names of all the <HI>Villages</HI> and <HI>Townships</HI> in this
Hundred. So we go on to <HI>Broxton,</HI> with a List of all the Townships
therein; the like of <HI>Nantwich, Edsbury, Northwich, Bulk∣ley,</HI> and
<HI>Maxfield.</HI> Here we have a brief Account of the Antiquity of the City of
<HI>Chester,</HI> from <HI>Henry Bradshaw</HI> and <HI>Ranulph Higden,</HI>
two Monks of that City, and from <HI>Holinshed</HI> and <HI>Harrison</HI>;
and then a Map giving a Prospect of <HI>Chester,</HI> the Ground Plot, and
Arms of the Earls since the Conquest. Then we advance more particularly to
the Longitude and Latitude of the City, Descriptions of the Walls, the Gates,
the Bridge, the Castle, Custom-House, Shire-Hall, Exchequer, and the
Parish Churches in <HI>Chester.</HI> Next of the Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs,
Common-Hall, the <HI>Pendice,</HI> the <HI>Rows,</HI> the Mercer's <HI>Row</HI>
and Conduits. Then of the Bishoprick of <HI>Chester.</HI> The Division of
<HI>Mer∣cia</HI> into five Bishopricks. The Names of the Bishops of
<HI>Chester,</HI> since the Beginning of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.
Market-Towns in <HI>Cheshire.</HI> The Manner of making Salt at
<HI>Nant∣wich,</HI> and at <HI>Northwich.</HI> After that short Account of
the Market-Towns, and some others of principal Note, and a Reference to the
Map for the rest, not named here, we have the Genealogy of the Earls of
<HI>Chester,</HI> since the Con∣quest; wherein is briefly shewed some
Part of their Deeds, beginning with <HI>Hugh Lupu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and ending with <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Black
Prince,</HI> who was the eleventh Earl. After these fol∣lows a Note of the
chief Places of Gentlemen in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> from <HI>John Leland</HI>;
and next, the Names of all the <HI>Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen,</HI> and
<HI>Freeholders</HI> in the County <HI>Pala∣tine</HI> of <HI>Chester,</HI>
and in what Hundred they dwell, taking up about three Leaves and a half. Then
comes a List of all the <HI>Mayors</HI> and <HI>Sheriffs</HI> of
<HI>Chester,</HI> beginning 1320, ending 1586, about fourteen Leaves. After
this, we have another List of the <HI>Benefices,</HI> or Rectories, and
Vicaridges in the County, with their <HI>Valuations,</HI> from a MS. in the
Library of St. <HI>John</HI>'s College, <HI>Cambridge.</HI> Then comes the
De∣scent of the Barons of <HI>Haulton,</HI> Constables of
<HI>Chester,</HI> and a Sculpture representing <HI>Beeston</HI> Castle,
with the Castle and Town of <HI>Haulton</HI>; also some <HI>Latin</HI>
Verses upon <HI>Beeston</HI> <PB N="233" REF="262"/> Castle, built by
<HI>Ranulph,</HI> third Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> from <HI>Le∣land,</HI> with
Translations of the last <HI>Distich,</HI> from <HI>Speed</HI> and
<HI>Camden</HI>; and a Note of the Battle on <HI>Blore</HI> Heath,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1459; which, with another Note touching the <HI>Arms</HI> of the
Gentry in this County, introducing eleven Pages of them, represented in
<HI>Sculpture, alphabetically,</HI> and a <HI>Table</HI> of the remarkable
Passages, in the foregoing Discourse, finishes this Part of the
<HI>Vale-Royal,</HI> ascribed to <HI>William Smith,</HI> by our Editor as
aforesaid; which, besides the Sculptures, takes up 99 Pages.</P>
<P>The other Part, or Description of this <HI>Vale-Royal,</HI> by
<HI>William Webb,</HI> M. A. and sometimes Under-Sheriff to Sir <HI>Richard
Lee,</HI> begins with his Wishes, that the Labours of Mr. <HI>John
Norden</HI> had been continued to the finishing of that Historical and
Chronographical Description of the rest of the Shires of this famous
Isle, which he had begun in that of <HI>Middlesex:</HI> also his
Commendations of our Worthy Coun∣tryman, Mr. <HI>John Speed</HI>'s Labours of
the same nature. At the End of this Introduction, he gives us a summary
Ac∣count, for his more methodical Proceeding, of what Mat∣ter he has chosen
to treat, and in what manner; so enters upon a Description of the City and
County Palatine of <HI>Chester</HI>; and because <HI>Broxton,</HI> in
some sort, contains or borders upon, and almost encompasses the
said City, he first makes a short Survey of that <HI>Hundred,</HI> then
more par∣ticularly describes the City itself, recites its Names, re∣marks
upon the ancient Foundations and Buildings thereof, more as a Topographer than
Antiquary, tho' not wholly a∣voiding historical Observation, where it will
illustrate his Account, as himself professes. The Authors used in
this Description, are <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis, Peter Langtoft, Ranulph
Higden, Harding, Caxton, Fabian, Holinshed, Stow, Camden,</HI> and a
manuscript Life of St. <HI>Werburg,</HI> in <HI>English</HI> Verse, by
<HI>Henry Bradshaw,</HI> Monk of <HI>Chester</HI>; out of whom he makes
several Quotations, and calls him their best Anti∣quary. Then follows a
Discourse of the Foundation and Endowment of the Abbey of St.
<HI>Werburg</HI> in <HI>Chester,</HI> writ∣ten by <HI>N. N.</HI> with two
Sculptures representing the Ground-Plot of her Church, and the Southern
Prospect of it. This holy Virgin appears to have been the Daughter of
<HI>Wulpher,</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> who died <HI>A. Dom.</HI> 675. She
had the Com∣mand over the Monasteries of <HI>Weedon, Trentham, Repton,</HI>
and <HI>Hambury.</HI> In her tender Years was professed under her Aunt
<HI>Andry</HI> at <HI>Ely,</HI> lived much at <HI>Weedon,</HI> deceas'd at 
<PB N="234" REF="263"/> <HI>Trentham,</HI> and was buried at <HI>Hambury,</HI>
but twice transla∣ted, first from <HI>Trentham</HI> to <HI>Hambury</HI>
about the Year 708, af∣terwards to <HI>Chester,</HI> about 875, as the 2 B.
and 2 Chap. of her <HI>Life</HI> aforesaid testify. After which follow
several mo∣numental Inscriptions in the Quire of the said Abbey, and in
St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Chapel, for <HI>William Downham,</HI> Bishop of
<HI>Chester,</HI> who died 1577; Dr. <HI>Geo. Lloyd,</HI> Bishop of
<HI>Sodor,</HI> 1615; Dr. <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> a famous Civilian, 1607; Sir
<HI>Geo. Beverley</HI>; the famous Abbot <HI>Simon Ripley,</HI> who died about
1492; Sir <HI>W. Gerrard,</HI> 1581; and in St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Chapel, Sir
<HI>Henry Troutbeck,</HI> round the Effigies of whose Body, in compleat
Armour, is neatly wrought a Wreath of Trouts. Here also was buried the late
famous Citizen <HI>Robert Brere∣wood,</HI> Alderman, and thrice Mayor of
<HI>Chester,</HI> who was, says our Author, 
<Q REND="inline">"The happy Father of the learned <HI>Edw.
Brerewood,</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI>; whose surpassing Progress in the
Stu∣dies of all manner of Learning, the University does yet, and for ever
will ring loud of; and <HI>Gresham</HI> College in <HI>London,</HI> where he
was <HI>Mathematical</HI> Reader, will, to the World's end, bewail the want of;
being deprived of him by an untimely Death, before he had finished, or taken
Order for Preservation of such learned Labours, as, if they were
published, wou'd make the World be∣holden to <HI>Chester,</HI> the Nurse
of such a Father, which begat such a Son."</Q> Here are also recited
several In∣scriptions of several other Mayors, Aldermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
of the said City. Then, after some Observations upon the River
<HI>Dee,</HI> and the renewing of the Haven, our Author gives us the Remainder
of his Remarks upon <HI>Broxton</HI> Hundred, taking notice all the way he
travels along, by the Towns and Lordships, of the principal Seats, or
Mannor-Houses, and by whom possessed or inhabited. This is also his
Course thro' the Hundred of <HI>Nantwich,</HI> where we have a Recital of the
Foundation-Charter of <HI>Cumbermere</HI> Abbey in <HI>Chester,</HI> founded
<HI>Anno</HI> 1133, by <HI>Hugh Malbanc,</HI> from the Annals of
<HI>Crocksdon,</HI> in the <HI>Cotton</HI> Library. In this Hundred, we have
some Remarks upon the Excellency of their Cheese, on their Salt-Pits or
<HI>Wiches,</HI> and a Sculpture of <HI>Crew</HI>-Hall. In the Hundred of
<HI>Northwich,</HI> our Author thinks the Ale of <HI>Sandach</HI> as worthy of
Praise, as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> does that of <HI>Derby</HI>; and if that Ale
got its Name from the old <HI>Danish</HI> word <HI>Oel,</HI> as he says,
our Author knows not why this may not, almost with as little Variation, come
from <HI>Oil,</HI> being almost as substantial in handling. He also
remarks upon <PB N="235" REF="264"/> the common Report of the Trees, which are
seen floating in <HI>Bagmere</HI> Pool above Water, just before any Heir of
the House of <HI>Brereton</HI> the Owner thereof dies; but looks upon it as
meerly accidental. In <HI>Eadsbury</HI> Hundred, we have the Foundation-Charter
of the Abbey of <HI>Dernhall,</HI> in the County of <HI>Chester,</HI>
translated afterwards to the <HI>Vale-Royal,</HI> given by <HI>Edward,</HI>
eldest Son of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. in the 54th Year of his Reign; also
the said King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Letters of Recommendation to all Abbots,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> for Books to be bestowed on the said
Abbey; also the Charter for Translation of the said Abbey to the
<HI>Vale-Royal.</HI> This Hundred he concludes with an Apology for passing
over some old Prophecies, some conceited Names of Trees, Moss-Pits,
Pools, long Shoots of old Archers, a Horse Race or two, and the latter
Newfound-Well, because he sup∣poses his long Journey in this little
Hundred, has well nigh tired his Reader already. In <HI>Werall</HI> Hundred,
when he comes to <HI>Birket</HI> Wood, we have a Prospect, in Sculpture, of
the Ruins of <HI>Berkenhead</HI> Abbey. A Reference to the
<HI>Monasticon,</HI> fol. 404; with the Charter of <HI>Hamon
Massie</HI>'s Donation of the Church of <HI>Bowdon,</HI> and another
Charter of Power to the Monks of <HI>Berkenhead.</HI> Thus he passes on, as
through the rest of the <HI>Hundreds,</HI> giving Descriptions of the chief
<HI>Seats</HI> all the way, and Characters of the <HI>Gentry</HI> who
possessed them, till he arrives again at the famous City of
<HI>Chester</HI>; and here takes the Government with its Go∣vernours under
Consideration, so begins with a Narrative of the <HI>Earls</HI> of
<HI>Chester</HI>; and first of those four or five be∣fore the Conquest,
who were named <HI>Edolf,</HI> from the Tes∣timony of <HI>Ranulph
Cestrensis</HI> and <HI>Fabian.</HI> 2. <HI>Curson,</HI> accor∣ding to
<HI>John Harding.</HI> 3. The famous <HI>Leofric,</HI> whose Power, Grandeur,
and charitable Works are celebrated by many Historians; but the Story of his
Wife <HI>Godwina,</HI> or <HI>Godiva,</HI> riding through the City of
<HI>Coventry</HI> naked, to ob∣tain the Franchisement of the City, is
suspected by our Au∣thor. 4. His Son <HI>Algarus.</HI> But these two (and
much less <HI>Jonas,</HI> mentioned in the Chronicle of <HI>St. Albans,</HI>
or <HI>Otho∣nel</HI>) are, tho' allowed to have been Earls of <HI>March,</HI>
by Sir <HI>John Fern,</HI> in his <HI>Second Part of Lacie's Nobility,</HI> not
rec∣koned to have been Earls of <HI>Chester,</HI> but he thinks they are so
mistaken to have been, by their Residence or Abode in that City, or
thereabouts. Here we enter upon the History of the Earls of
<HI>Chester</HI> from the Conquest, of whom there is more certain Record;
beginning with <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> who was <PB N="236" REF="265"/> the Son of
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror's Sister, and we have a Sculpture
representing the said Earl in Parliament with the Barons and Abbots of the
County Palatine; which <HI>Hugh</HI> having governed the Earldom 40 Years, died
about 1107. In the like manner, we have a Chapter a-piece upon the six
ensuing Earls, ending with <HI>John Scot,</HI> who died in 1237, without
Issue. King <HI>Henry</HI> III. took the Earldom of Ches∣ter into his
hands, and it was thenceforward held by Princes of the Blood Royal; of whom,
after a little Account of the Barons under the ancient Earls, we have also a
Cata∣logue down to Prince <HI>Charles.</HI> This is followed with a
Dis∣course of the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> State and Government in this
County; the Successions of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> and, with more
certainty, from the 33d of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. ending with Dr. <HI>John
Bridgman.</HI> The next Chapter treats of the Govern∣ment of the County and
City, by the Officers, or Princes, who ruled here after the Earls, down to King
<HI>James</HI> I. Then we have a Table of the Mayors and Sheriffs of
<HI>Chester,</HI> from 1242 to 1655, interspersed with little
historical Me∣moirs of some noted Occurrences, happening under several
Years within that Time and Place. After this, we have the Names of the
Justices of <HI>Chester,</HI> with another List of the Sheriffs of the
County: and the whole closes with a Copy from <HI>Domesday</HI> Book,
<HI>sub Titulo, Cestersheire</HI>; shew∣ing in whose
Possession the Lands of this County were at the Conquest. So ends
this second and more copious Nar∣rative of the said County Palatine,
containing 239 Pages; and has an <HI>Index,</HI> like the former, at the End of
it.</P>
<P>But here follows another Tract, not before spoken of in either
of the Title-Pages before the Book, or in the Editor's Preface, not being
communicated perhaps till they were printed; and it is called <HI>Chronicon
Cestrense,</HI> written by <HI>Samuel Lee,</HI> as appears at the End of
his Epistle to the said Editor his ingenious Friend Mr. <HI>D. King,</HI>
dated <HI>May</HI> 8, 1656. In this Epistle, perceiving the exact Times of
the former Rulers of that Province, not so much attended as might
illustrate that <HI>Vale-Royal,</HI> he desired to communicate to Pa∣per,
what he has observed in his Reading, which might conduce to the fixing of the
Times and Seasons, wherein the noble Atchivements of its Rulers and
Inhabitants have been performed. And indeed he has shew'd himself more
critically acquainted with all our ancient Historians, as to Time and Place,
the two Eyes of History, than both the foregoing Authors put together. His
Work begins with a <PB N="237" REF="266"/> Chapter upon the Romans in
<HI>Cheshire,</HI> in which we have the various Opinions of several Authors
concerning its Longitude and Latitude; but he prefers <HI>Shakerley</HI> in his
<HI>British Tables,</HI> before all the rest. Then we have, in Chap∣ter 2,
the Kings, Dukes, and Earls of <HI>Mercia,</HI> with the particular Earls of
<HI>Chester</HI> from the Conquest, and those of the Royal Blood,
disposed in their exact Times, in five se∣veral Sections. The third
Chapter treats of the Bishops of <HI>Mercia,</HI> who had their Seats
sometimes at <HI>Coventry,</HI> some∣times at <HI>Chester,</HI> most
commonly at <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and there∣fore are usually so stiled;
but had <HI>Cheshire</HI> under their Epis∣copal Government. Also of the
Bishops of <HI>Chester</HI> since the Conquest; and of the peculiar
Bishops of <HI>Chester,</HI> from the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in
four Sections. The fourth and last Chapter discourses of the
Parliamentary Barons of the Earls of <HI>Chester:</HI> And first of the
Barons Temporal, in which we have the Stem of the Barons of <HI>Haulton</HI>;
lastly, of the Barons Spiritual, being an Account of the Earls, Bi∣shops,
and Abbots. But before we leave this Work where∣in the Author has proved
himself so expert in calculating and fixing of ancient Times, as to make us
wish that <HI>Saxon</HI> History he promises in two or three Places, had
seen the light; we shall only remark out of his second Chapter, upon the
<HI>Mercian</HI> Monarchy, how he accounts for many Defects in our old
historical Computations; where he says, 
<Q REND="inline">"Consi∣dering that all our Monkish Writers
more skillful in num∣bering of Beads than Years, did <HI>uno tramite</HI>
follow the <HI>Dionysian</HI> Account, a thing diligently to be attended in
the reading of our <HI>monastical</HI> Writers, I hope to extricate myself
out of these Difficulties, by treating a little of it be∣fore I begin with
the Reigns of the Kings of <HI>Mercia.</HI>"</Q> Then having given an Example
to shew wherein that Ac∣count is deficient, and Direction to several
Authorities for Confirmation thereof, he further 
<Q REND="inline">"refers this to be proved more at large in its
proper Place, when he treats about the <HI>Saxons</HI> Arrival into our Land,
demonstrating their Entrance to have been in the Vulgar Year of Christ 428,
and not in 449 or 450, as our old Authors usually fix'd it; whereby great and
knotty Difficulties have tied up the History of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Dominion
in this Island."</Q> Thus much of this Chronological Treatise, containing
55 Pages. We come now, lastly, to</P>
<P><HI>A short Treatise of the Isle of Man,</HI> &amp;c.
illustrated with several Prospects of the Island by <HI>D. King,</HI>
1556. 'Tis <PB N="238" REF="267"/> dedicated to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord
<HI>Fairfax,</HI> Lord of <HI>Man,</HI> and of the Isles, by the Author
<HI>James Chaloner,</HI> one of the Com∣missioners for settling Affairs
in that Island, who dates his said Epistle from <HI>Middle-Park,
Dec.</HI> 1, 1653; wherein it ap∣pears, he was the rather induced to present
the same to his Lordship, because of his Respect to Antiquities, so
signally manifested in patronizing our notable <HI>English</HI> Antiquary
Mr. <HI>Roger Dodsworth,</HI> in his Collections, composing and
pub∣lishing of that singular Piece his <HI>Monasticon,</HI> &amp;c. The
Work is divided into six Chapters, which, after a Map of the Island
environ'd with little Prospects of some notable Parts or Places in it,
begins, 1. with the Situation of the <HI>Isle of Man.</HI> 2. Concerning the
Inhabitants, whence derived, their Lan∣guage the <HI>Manks</HI> Tongue, and of
the Translation of the Bible therein, and of the Conditions of the People. 3.
Of the State Ecclesiastical; of the Bishops, Monasteries, and
Free-Schools, with three Prospects in Sculpture, of <HI>Balisaly</HI>
Abbey, the Nunnery; and the Bishop's Court. 4. Of the Civil Government, and
the supreme Governors, particu∣larly King <HI>Edward</HI> II. his Grant of
the Island to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Beaumont</HI>; and here we have a
Sculpture of the Arms of the <HI>Beaumonts.</HI> Then the Author descends to
the inferior Officers, and the Judicatories of the said Isle. The fifth
Chapter is concerning the Trade of the Isle. And the last Chapter is of the
Strength of the Island, where we have three Prospects in Sculpture, of the
Castle <HI>Rushen, Peel</HI> Castle, and <HI>Douglas</HI> Fort; upon
which Fortifications and others, that might be wanting, our Author concludes,
That the <HI>Poverty</HI> of the Island is its greatest <HI>Security.</HI>
The whole is no more than 32 Pages, followed with a Leaf of <HI>Addenda,
Errata,</HI> and a Table of the true Longitude and Latitude of certain Cities
in <HI>England,</HI> which ends the whole Book.</P>

<HI>Draught</HI> of the STATUTES of the PUBLIC LIBRARY at OXFORD, (in
<HI>English</HI>) and a <HI>Collection</HI> of LETTERS to Dr. JAMES, &amp;c.
<HI>Publish'd from the</HI> Originals <HI>in the said Library.</HI> Octavo,

<P>THESE <HI>Remains</HI> of that famous <HI>Founder</HI> of the
<HI>Public Library</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> are pretty well known to have been
published, tho' their Editors Name appears not to them, by the late Mr.
<HI>Hearne.</HI> In his <HI>Preface,</HI> after having touch'd up∣on the
Antiquity of <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Libraries,</HI> and shewn how ancient
they were in <HI>Egypt</HI>; what a magnificent Collection was made there by
<HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and what Ambition the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> had
of this kind; he descends to observe how early Learning flourish'd in
<HI>Britain</HI>; and that in King <HI>Al∣fred</HI>'s Time, there were divers
Libraries for the Preserva∣tion of Learning; but is more particular of
<HI>Richard de Bury,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> his noble Gift of Books
to this Univer∣sity in 1295, as may be further gather'd from his own Ac∣count
in his <HI>Philobiblos, sive de Amore Librorum,</HI> first prin∣ted at
<HI>Paris,</HI> afterwards at <HI>Oxford,</HI> 4to, 1599, and since in 8vo.
Also of <HI>Thomas Cobham,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Worcester</HI>'s Build∣ing
for a Library in the said University in 1320. That after this, another
Library was built there by Duke <HI>Humphrey,</HI> and famous in 1439, which
falling to Ruin towards the end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, Sir
<HI>Thomas Bodley,</HI> a second <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> began to restore it in
1597, finish'd it in two Years, and in a few more so nobly endow'd it with
Books, Re∣venues, and other Buildings, that it is accounted one of the
<HI>most famous Libraries in the World</HI>; excelling, according to the
Accounts of Travellers, the <HI>Vatican</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>; that being so
full of Corruptions and Forgeries. The <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Bodleian
Library</HI> is given us by the <HI>Oxford</HI> Antiquary (<HI>An∣thony
Wood</HI>) at large: But the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of the Printed Books, by Dr.
<HI>Hyde</HI>: We have had one since also of the MSS; but both being
imperfect, we are here told, an <HI>Appendix</HI> <PB N="240" REF="269"/> to the
former, as big as the Doctors Catalogue, was now ready for the Press; and
that an <HI>Appendix</HI> also to the latter, was in some time to be
publish'd; yet are we still in expec∣tation of them. The Editor likewise
says, 'Twas for the sake of this noble Library, that lately, in his
searches there∣in, finding the <HI>Life</HI> of Sir <HI>Thomas Bodley</HI>;
the first Draught of its <HI>Statutes,</HI> and a Collection of his Letters
to Dr. <HI>James,</HI> the first <HI>Keeper</HI> of it, all written by Sir
<HI>Thomas</HI> his own Hand, he took a Transcript of them, and sent them
to the Press; that others, imitating Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> his Zeal and
In∣dustry for the good of Learning, might become Benefactors themselves to
such a noble Repository; which they cou'd not do at a better time, since
the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> for sending certain Copies thither,
of Books printed at <HI>London,</HI> was expired. The <HI>Life,</HI> he says,
has been printed some Years before, and two Letters to Sir <HI>Francis
Bacon,</HI> lately, at the end of Archbishop <HI>Usher</HI>'s Letters; but
the Copies of the former, being dispersed, and the latter, containing
Mat∣ter of Moment, it was thought fit to reprint them.</P>
<P>In the LIFE <HI>of Sir</HI> THO. BODLEY <HI>written by
himself,</HI> con∣sisting of 15 Pages, he tells us he was born at
<HI>Exeter</HI> in <HI>De∣vonshire,</HI> the 2d of March 1544, of
Worshipful Parents. That his Father, a known Enemy to Popery, fled in Queen
<HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign into <HI>Germany,</HI> sent for his Family and
settling at <HI>Geneva,</HI> when our Author was twelve Years of Age, had him
instructed in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> by <HI>Chevalerius</HI> and
<HI>Beroaldus</HI>; and in Divinity by <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Beza,</HI>
besides Do∣mestic Teachers. In the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
Reign, they return'd to <HI>London,</HI> and he was sent to com∣plete his
Studies at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he took his Batchelor of Arts Degree, and was
chose Probationer of <HI>Merton</HI> College in 1563, and the Year after
admitted Fellow. In 1565 read the <HI>Greek Lecture.</HI> Proceeded Master of
Arts 1566, and read for that Year, <HI>Natural Philosophy</HI>; was elected
one of the Proctors in 1569. Supply'd for a long time, the Place of
<HI>University Orator.</HI> Travell'd into <HI>Italy, France,</HI> and
<HI>Germany,</HI> to acquire the Modern Tongues in 1576. In 1585, was sent by
the Queen to several <HI>German</HI> Princes, to procure their Aid for the
King of <HI>Navarre.</HI> Also to <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> III. of <HI>France,</HI>
both for this King's Advantage and that of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Cause.
In 1588 was sent to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and there admitted one of their
Council of State, and acquitted himself in his Charge, so much to the
Queen's Satisfaction, that thenceforward he rarely received any
<HI>Instructions</HI> in <PB N="241" REF="270"/> these Proceedings of State.
After his return from near five Years Foreign Employment, he was sent to the
<HI>Hague</HI> again but return'd in less than a Year: Yet was no sooner
come home, but the Queen pleas'd with his Discoveries, sent him again to
the <HI>States,</HI> with Charge to pursue, what he had secretly propos'd;
whereby all was brought to the Issue desir'd. In all which Employments,
he had no one more to his Friend among the Lords of the Council, than the
Treasurer <HI>Burghly,</HI> who was of Opinion there was no Man so sit
for the Office of Secretary of State, and whose Intention was, when he
advanced his own Son thereto, to make Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> his Collegue. But
before he return'd from the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in 1597, the Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> in Opposition to the <HI>Cecils,</HI> had so prodigally
recommended his Sufficiency to the Queen for the Post aforesaid, that she
(who hated the Earl's Ambition) was not the readier to prefer him, tho' they
were to be jealous of him. Thus finding his Preferment on this Quarter
obstructed, and considering what a slender hold∣fast the Earl had with
the Queen; withal his declining Years, and the easy Circumstances of his
own Fortune, he resolv'd to retire; and tho' he had afterwards, both in the
Queen's Reign, and King <HI>James</HI>'s, many honourable Invitations, as well
to Foreign as Domestic Employments, he concluded at last <HI>to set up
his Staff at the Library Door in Oxon,</HI> and ac∣commodate that ruin'd Place
for the Public Use of Stu∣dents; finding himself competently furnish'd
with the fourfold Aid necessary thereto, which was a Knowledge in the
Learn∣ed and Modern <HI>Tongues,</HI> as well as sundry kinds of
Scho∣lastic Literature; a <HI>Purse-Ability</HI>; Store of Honourable
<HI>Friends,</HI> and <HI>Leisure</HI> to follow the Work: But how well he
has sped; he thinks that which is already perform'd in sight, that which
besides he has given for the Maintenance of it, and which he afterwards
purposes to add, will so abundantly testify, that he needs not be the
Publisher of the Worth of his own Institution. Written, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
1609. Signed <HI>T. B.</HI> Then follows:</P>
<P>Sir THOMAS BODLEY's <HI>first Draught of the</HI> STATUTES
<HI>of the</HI> PUBLICK LIBRARY <HI>at</HI> OXON, <HI>transcribed</HI> from
the <HI>Original</HI> Copy, written by his own <HI>Hand</HI> and reposited in
the <HI>Archives</HI> of the said <HI>Library.</HI> Herein, upon the
Consi∣deration that no Institution can have the good Effects in∣tended,
unless there be Statutes to encounter and restrain the Disorders of
ill-affected Persons, it is ordain'd, by the Chan∣cellor, Vice-Chancellor,
Doctors, Proctors, Masters, Re∣gents, <PB N="242" REF="271"/> <HI>&amp;c</HI>
of the great Convocation of the University upon their frequent Consultation
with Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> That some one be deputed to the keeping of this
Library, who is a diligent Student, Trusty, Active and Discreet; a
Graduate, a Lin∣guist, unmarried and unbeneficed. That the manner of
e∣lecting such a <HI>Keeper,</HI> shou'd be like that yearly practis'd in
the choice of their Proctors; and first the Electors to be tender'd one Oath,
then the Elected another, which are here specified. That the said Keeper is
not to be displaced but by his own Assent, unless for some heinous
Offence or apparent Insufficiency. That his Business shall be to keep
and con∣tinue the great Register-Book, chain'd to the Desk at the upper
Window of the Library, in which are to be inroll'd the Names of Benefactors
thereto, whether mean Persons or great: Which Book to be fairly written, and
laid to open sight, as a Token of thankful Acceptation and Inducement of
Imitation to Posterity. He is further also to range all his Books according
to their Faculties, to assign to every Family its Catalogues and Tables,
dispose of the Authors therein named Alphabetically, and besides their
Names and Title of their Works, express in what sized Volume printed, the
Place where, and the Year when. Upon Gifts of Books to the Library, what Order
to be taken, that they be put up in good plight, and the Charge to be
supply'd by the Vice-Chancellor, (Receiver of the Library Rents) and upon
Gifts in Money; how it is to be disposed of to the Donors satisfaction.
That for the Accommodation of Students, the Keeper is not to be exempted one
whole Day in the Year upon Penalty of 20 Shillings, except <HI>Sunday,
Christmas-day,</HI> and some others here named: But to come constantly to
the opening of the Library Doors, and give access to others from Eight to
Eleven in the Morning, and Two till Five in Afternoon, from <HI>Easter</HI>
to <HI>Michaelmas</HI>; but the rest of the Year, from One to Four in the
Afternoon; a Warning-Bell to be rung at his Ingress and Egress. None to
enter by Night, with Candle, Lamp, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Next, of the care to be
taken by Students in reading the Books, fastning the Clasps and Strings,
untangling the Chains, and leaving the Volumes in the Places they found them.
And for the smaller Volumes within the Grates, and under the Custody of the
Keeper a∣lone, he is to deliver them out by Hand and Tale, and with Condition,
that they be perused in sight, and presently re∣stor'd to him or his
Assistant, who is to look out and deliver Books so ask'd for, and but
six at a time of one sort or <PB N="243" REF="272"/> other, unless he be
won to gratify some Persons to exceed that Number. No Books to be lent out
of the Library upon any Security whatever; and in Case of Books to be sold
as unprofitable, or chang'd for better Editions, or carri∣ed out to be new
bound, the Keeper to consult the Over∣seers to be appointed. The Keeper's
Absence to be dispens∣ed with in case of Business, seven Days
every Quarter; but his Office to be supply'd by some able Graduate, who is
of known Fidelity, or shall take the Oath. And if the Case is such, that
longer Absence is allow'd by common Suffrage in Convocation, to be accorded
with. For this continual At∣tendance and Engagement, the Keeper tho' he has
greater Advantages to advance his Knowledge and Credit than o∣ther Students, is
to have, besides the Annual Stipend of 20 <HI>Nobles,</HI> which was the
Donation of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. issuable from the University
Treasure, 33 Pounds, 6 Shillings and 8 Pence, and to be paid half-yearly out
of the Library Re∣venue, and his Assistant Ten Pounds; and Four Pounds
more to a poor Scholar or Servant, for sweeping, wiping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
choice of these to be at the Keeper's Discretion, their Payment at the
Vice-Chancellor's care, and displacing of them in the power of the
Overseers. That for the safer Cu∣stody of the Revenue aforesaid, it
shou'd be lock'd up where the University Rents are kept, in an Iron
Chest, under three different Locks, with double Keys, to remain with the
Vice-Chancellor and two Proctors; which last two are to be Witnesses of
the Sums brought in or taken out and regi∣ster'd by the third. The Persons
to be admitted as <HI>Students</HI> are next distinguish'd; besides all
Graduates, Benefactors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Strangers, or such as have no
University Education, or been Contributors, may for the furtherance of their
Study obtain the Freedom of Recourse; the same being craved as a Grace in
the Convocation House, and the Oath of Fideli∣ty to the Library, here
exhibited, first by them, as by all o∣ther Persons, before the constant
Liberty of Entrance, ta∣ken; and a Penalty impos'd upon those who intrude
with∣out Permission before they are sworn; unless accompanied with one
who is sworn; as also upon any who shall be con∣victed of dismembering,
purloining, or corrupting the Sense of any Books. Lest the Keeper shou'd
be tardy in his Duty, eight principal Graduates are appointed perpetual
Overseers and Visitors of the Library, every 8th Day of <HI>November,</HI>
(the Day of first opening or free Access,) who are not only to examine how
well the Keeper has perfom'd his Charge, but <PB N="244" REF="273"/> direct him
in doubtful Matters, and reform him in erroneous ones; also to appoint the
Exchange, or disposal of superflu∣ous, and Purchase of new Books; and
to have forty Shillings for a Dinner or Supper that Day, also Gloves of Ten
Shil∣lings a Pair, to the five Professors of the King's Lectures, and the
two Proctors, which two are also to have forty Shil∣lings each, for the
Custody of the Keys; one Pair of Gloves at five Shillings to the Beadle then
attending; one Pair of 20 Shillings to the Vice-Chancellor, with 20 Nobles in
regard of his Trouble, he only being to deal with the Employment of the Annual
Rents of the Library: Yet at the end of the Year to let the Visitors and
Keeper see the Money remain∣ing in the Iron Chest, with the Account of
Receipts and Disbursements, which they are to audit, so deliver up his Keys
and Accounts to the New Vice-Chancellor, relating the State thereof, at the
next Convocation; who are to take notice of the last Vice-Chancellor's
Discharge of his Trust, according to his Merit; and in all former Acts and
Decrees, expound, alter, abrogate, or innovate, and provide in all Events for
the Indemnity of the Library, as for a Treasure, to Students, of incomparable
Worth. So we come to</P>
<P>The LETTERS; which are 234 in Number; and mostly written by Sir
<HI>Thomas Bodley</HI> himself, from <HI>London, Ful∣ham</HI> and
<HI>Burnham,</HI> to Dr. <HI>Thomas James,</HI> the first Keeper of his
Library. Few of them have the Date of the Year when written, but the earliest
Date we meet with, is in 1602; to Dr.<HI>Rives,</HI> Vice-Chancellor of
<HI>Oxon,</HI> about open∣ing the Library and constituting the Statutes
thereof, there∣fore, perhaps, shou'd have stood the first in this
Collection; and the latest is dated in 1611. Though one, towards the end,
without any Date, was written much sooner than the former, being to his
Cousin <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> when he was a Youth in <HI>France,</HI>
containing Advice to him in his <HI>Travels</HI>; and the last Letter in the
Book is written to Dr. <HI>James,</HI> by <HI>Laurence Bodley</HI> after the
Death of his Brother Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> (which was in 1612.) Except another
Letter from Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Bodley</HI> to the said Sir <HI>Francis
Bacon,</HI> which is also some∣what Foreign to these Collections, as
containing both a Cen∣sure and Commendation of some Maxims of Modern
Philo∣sophy in his <HI>Novum Organum</HI>; that which the Reader is to look
for in these Letters, might be sorted and compre∣hended under these five
Topics. The <HI>Founder</HI>; the <HI>Bene∣factors</HI>; the <HI>Books</HI>;
the <HI>Library,</HI> and the <HI>Librarian:</HI> But we, for the Reader's
Facility of finding the Particulars here <PB N="245" REF="274"/> extracted,
shall give a transient View of the most observable among them, in the
same Order as they occur; which, tho' in the Collection itself, short,
dissever'd, often repeated, and unconcluded in many Points, as the Nature
is of Occa∣sional Letters, in such familiar Intercourse; yet may yield
many Historical Hints, relating to the Encouragers of this Foundation, or the
manner of collecting and preserving the Writings of Learned and Ingenious
Men.</P>
<P>Such therefore are the <HI>Founder's</HI> Expostulations with
his <HI>Librarian,</HI> upon his sudden thoughts of a married Life; the
same being utterly deny'd; also concerning the Advantages he had of
improving his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and the Opportunities there might be of
augmenting his <HI>Salary</HI>; his Notice of se∣veral Benefactors, as Mr.
<HI>Hariot</HI> the Mathematician, Mr. <HI>Haidock,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ridley,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Urrey,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Farmer</HI>; his Judgment of a
<HI>Transcriber,</HI> and of <HI>Duplicate</HI> Copies; Ad∣vice about making
the <HI>Catalogues,</HI> and advertising each other of such Books as were
given or new bought, and not to let the knowledge of defective Copies be
divulged. Of the Course to be taken with such as had been
<HI>Promisers</HI> of Con∣tributions, but no <HI>Performers.</HI> Further
Advice about the <HI>Catalogue,</HI> as when divers Authors are bound in one
Volume, not to bury them all under the Name of the first Author, but to name
every Author distinctly in his proper Letter of the Alphabet, and to place
the Name before, not after the Title of the Book. Notice of the Arrival of many
Books from <HI>John Bill</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> and more expected. The
Foun∣der's Approbation of a Table to enlist the Names of Bene∣factors and
their Gifts, till the Register be finished. The Lord <HI>Treasurer's</HI>
Donation of an Hundred Pounds unto the Library. The Founders Consent that any
Gentleman Stranger, after request to the Congregation, and taking the Oath,
may have free Access to the Library. That <HI>John Bill</HI> had bought Four
Hundred Pounds worth of Books a∣broad. That such as give only a little Book
or two, may not expect to be recorded on the Register. That the Lord
<HI>Cobham</HI> had given Fifty Pounds to the Library, and pro∣mis'd divers
MSS. out of St. <HI>Augustine</HI>'s Library in <HI>Canter∣bury.</HI> The
Founder's Supposal that there are not to be had Twenty Pounds worth of the
Books of Protestant Writers, which he has not already, and that of those in
Folio, thinks they have all that can begotten. His Opinion about sorting and
fastning the Books, also of figuring them with great Letters. Some Defects
specified in the Librarian's Cata∣logue. <PB N="246" REF="275"/> Further
Intimations of Benefactors, as the Earl of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> Mr.

<HI>Burhil,</HI> Mr. <HI>Canning.</HI> The Founder's Care for every thing to be
in Order at the opening of the Library. His Advice how the Librarian should
receive Sir <HI>John Fortescue,</HI> suita∣ble to his Dignity and Desert.
Concerning the <HI>Frankfort</HI> Catalogues of Books, containing all from 1564
to 1592, and another from thence to 1600, also in 4<HI>to.</HI> The Bishop
of <HI>Durham</HI>'s Promise of Fifty Pounds. The Founder's Opi∣nion what
Officer only shou'd be under the Keeper of the Library. The Lord
<HI>Mountjoy</HI>'s Gift of an Hundred Pounds. Further Advice about the
Duplicates. The Librarian's La∣bour in copying of Catalogues acknowledged, but
withal their Imperfections, as being taken in haste, with Advice about a new
Catalogue. The Founder's Intention of in∣treating the Vice-Chancellor, to move
the University for their Letters of Public Thanks, to the Lord of
<HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> who gave an Hundred Pounds; to Sir <HI>Walter
Ra∣leigh,</HI> who gave Fifty Pounds; and to Sir <HI>Edmund Udal,</HI> who gave
as much to the Library; with Intimations in the same Letter of the King's
being expected at <HI>Oxford.</HI> The Books of <HI>Worcester</HI> Library to
be selected for this at <HI>Ox∣ford.</HI> Mr. Comptroller's Promise of
Fifty Pounds. Of placing the <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> figuring the Books with
Letters, and fixing of Catalogues for a Tryal to the Tables; with the Founder's
Caution to avoid Censure. His Considera∣tions about the Register-Book.
Some mention of the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Gift, and Sir <HI>Robert
Sidney</HI>'s, and Mr. <HI>Barkham</HI>'s. The Founder's Opinion that there
shou'd be no Vacation at all in the Library; but that the Keeper being
absent up∣on urgent Occasions, another might supply his room till he
return, in regard of the Time good Students wou'd lose. A reason for
binding sundry Authors together, that the mul∣tiplicity of Chains might not
take away the sight and shew of the Books. The Earl of
<HI>Southampton</HI>'s Gift of an Hun∣dred Pounds to the Library. The Founder's
Character of himself, as to matters of Literature, in these Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"As touching your Title-Page and your Epistle, I
am no Judge for you to build on: For in my own Writings, I am altogether
negligent, and in censuring other Men's, some∣what too curious."</Q> Some
notice of Dr. <HI>Reynolds</HI> his Gift, and of some Books from
<HI>Windsor</HI>; but if not to be had with∣out his Majesty's leave, to let
them alone, he not thinking it proper to be a Suitor for them, unless the
Gift were <PB N="247" REF="276"/> greater, his Majesty having given him larger
Expectations. Lady <HI>Vere</HI>'s Request, that in the Inscription to her
Gifts, there shou'd after <HI>Vidua,</HI> be set down <HI>&amp; Filia Jo.
Tracy de Tuddington Militis.</HI> The Founder's Recommendation of his
Librarian's Suit to the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> A singular
Courte∣sy of lending out the Manuscript Epistles of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI>
to Sir <HI>Henry Savile,</HI> his Affection to the storing and preser∣ving
of the Library being singular. The Lord <HI>Cranborn</HI>'s Gift of Fifty
Pounds to the Library. The Founder's Glad∣ness at the Assurance of his
Librarian's Information, that in <HI>England</HI> there are more Books to be
found, than are worth Five Hundred Pounds, which are not in the Library. 
<Q REND="inline">"For, says he, you shall never see, that any
good Books shall be lost for want of buying, tho' I find no Contribu∣tors:
Albeit you need not doubt, but I shall always find sufficient."</Q> Further
Expostulation with his Librarian a∣bout leaving his Charge, and betaking to a
private Course, and about his engaging Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> to obtain him
two Prebends, with Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> his Offer of Twenty Pounds a-year to be
Chaplain in his House, to the dislike of the Founder, who cou'd not promote
such Motions, and thought that all <HI>Promises</HI> of Livings, when they
fall, and <HI>Letters</HI> of Recommendation, are to very small purpose
unless they be follow'd and effected; and tho' Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> cou'd
procure many of those, none of them all wou'd relieve him. The Inscription
upon Sir <HI>Francis Vere</HI>'s Gift of Books this Year (when the King of
<HI>Denmark</HI> was in <HI>England</HI>) to be, <HI>Dona∣vit jam tertio</HI>
10 <HI>Libras.</HI> Mr. <HI>Worseley</HI>'s Present of some MSS. of
<HI>Roger Bacon,</HI> and Notice of the King's Grant of some Books. An
Observation that the Libraries at <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> were meanly stored,
and <HI>Trinity</HI> College worst of all. Of the Duke of
<HI>Brunswick</HI>'s Entertainment at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and of his Promise
made to the Library. The Founder's Opi∣nion about the choice of a
<HI>Librarian</HI> or his <HI>Deputy</HI>; that he shou'd be one whose
Person, as well as Learning were to be liked, in regard of the great Access
of great Persons oftentimes of both Sexes; therefore that he who attends upon
them, shou'd be a <HI>personable Scholar,</HI> and qualified with a
Gentleman-like Speech and Carriage. A Compu∣tation of the room to be allow'd
for Books of Law and Phy∣sick, and that the former Faculty will require five
times more than the latter. Notice of the King's Warrant for the choice of any
Books in any of his Libraries. The Er∣rors of the Librarian's <HI>Hebrew</HI>
Words (in his Catalogue) <PB N="248" REF="277"/> observ'd by the Founder, and
concerning the <HI>Dedication,</HI> he says, 
<Q REND="inline">"I do not mean the <HI>King,</HI> as you
supposed, but the <HI>Prince</HI>; for that to the King, there are daily
Books dedicated, and, for aught I can hear, few Rewards be∣stowed; whereof I
do think you may have more hope at the Prince's hands, by the means of good
Friends."</Q> Of the Founder's Speech, for the Librarian to receive his
Majesty with; and of his firm denial to lend any Books out of the Library.
The Lord <HI>Paget</HI> a Donor of some Books, and Dean <HI>Wood</HI> of an
Hundred Marks. Preparations ap∣pointed against the King's coming. Concerning
<HI>Buchanan</HI>'s Book (against the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>) the Founder
says, 
<Q REND="inline">"it is in your Catalogue, and it will not avail to
conceal him in his Desk, neither do I think, that it will be thought on; or if
it be, as yet we have no reason to take any Notice of the King's
dislike."</Q> The Founder's Conjecture, that when those Books he has laid
out for are brought in, there will not be above Two Hundred New Books to be
added yearly. His Reasons against an Assistant Librarian or Deputy.

bestow a Prebend upon the Librarian. Mr. <HI>Thomas Allen</HI>'s Gift of
<HI>Greek</HI> MSS. and other Books. The Founders Opi∣nion about buying new
Editions of Books they already had. His Preference of Sir <HI>Henry
Savil</HI>'s Judgment of his Build∣ing. Several Observations further about
the printed Cata∣logue, and about the Precedency of Faculties, as Law be∣fore
Physick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Librarian's intended Undertaking to compare the
Fathers approv'd, if it will not require a Dispensation of his Personal
Attendance. The Bishop of <HI>London</HI>'s Gift of Fifty Pounds. And the
Founder's Brother <HI>Laurence Bodley,</HI> Canon of <HI>Exeter,</HI> his
Addition of Twenty Pounds to his former Gifts. Further Escapes noted in the
Librarian's Catalogue of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Books. The Founder's Opinion for
excluding Almanacks, Plays, and Numbers more daily printed, hardly one in forty
being worth keeping. That in other Nations, <HI>Plays</HI> may be more
esteem'd for learning the Languages, and being compiled by Men of Wis∣dom
and Learning, seldom the Case among us; and tho' some little Profit might
be reaped from some Play-Books, it will not countervail the Scandal they will
bring on the Li∣bary, when it shall be given out, it is stuff'd with
Baggage Books; and that a few wou'd be multiply'd by such as pur∣pose to
disgrace it. Sir <HI>H. Savil,</HI> by what he has given and 
<PB N="249" REF="278"/> purposes to give, likely to prove the greatest
Benefactor. That Sir <HI>Thomas Knevet,</HI> and Sir <HI>Peter Young,</HI>
dealt very much underhand to stop the King's Grant of Books. The Founder's
free Opinions of the Librarian's Work to prove the Corruptions of the Fathers.
His Censure of Dr. <HI>How∣son</HI>'s last Sermon, utterly void of all
Honesty and Wit. An Account of young <HI>Drusius</HI> coming to
<HI>Oxford.</HI> One Hun∣dred Pounds gotten by the means of Sir <HI>Edwyn
Sandys</HI> to the Library. Advice against the Repetition of Authors in the
Catalogue. The Founder's dislike of his Librarian's Proposal of a Library
for the younger Sort. Mrs. <HI>Owen</HI>'s Gift of an Hundred Pound to the
Library. The Founder congratulates his Librarian for the Opportunity he had of
shewing himself in the Speech, he was to make to the King. His further
Opinion about their collating of the Fathers, and about the Speech aforesaid,
that it shou'd not be above half a quarter of an Hour long, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
His mention of other Be∣nefactors, Mr. <HI>Barneston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Evan
Jones,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dorel,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Edward Jones.</HI> His Opinion that
<HI>Wickliffe</HI> is not infe∣rior to <HI>Scotus</HI> in Subtilty; his Caution
to the Librarian, to be well advised in what he shall publish from that
Author, which in regard of his Office, may be thought the Act of the
University. No Notice to be taken of some Books the King prohibited in
<HI>Scotland.</HI> Of <HI>Josippus Barbatus</HI> the <HI>Egyptian</HI> coming
to <HI>Oxford.</HI> Further of the Founder's Un∣dertaking to collate the
Fathers. His further Advice about the Librarian's Speech to the King. That it
must be <HI>short and sweet and full of Stuff.</HI> His Orders to put Sir
<HI>Henry Wotton</HI>'s Name before a little Alcoran with Points, as the Donor.
His Resolution to be determin'd by the Delegates about the Statutes, and
mention of Sir <HI>Tho. Smith</HI>'s Gift to the Library, and for Dr.
<HI>Budden</HI> to be admitted one of the Delegates. Other Donors, as Sir
<HI>William Roper</HI> (who gave the Works of Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>) Mr.
<HI>Hakewell,</HI> &amp;c. men∣tion'd by the Founder. His further Enquiries
after Dr. <HI>Howson,</HI> and Opinion that he shou'd be severely
censur'd, and made to recant his malicious Taxation of those he terms
<HI>Glossers,</HI> or not suffer'd to hatch his new-fangledness in the
University. His Orders for placing the Book, which Mr. <HI>Co∣ryat,</HI> the
famous Traveller, writ and bestow'd on the Library, in some such Place
during the Act, at which the Author was to be present, as might seem to
magnify both him and his Work. The rest of this Collection consists only
of the three Letters, written by the Founder, to Dr. <HI>Rives,</HI> and 
<PB N="250" REF="279"/> Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI>; and one by his Brother
<HI>Laurence Bod∣ley,</HI> to Dr. <HI>James,</HI> as was observed, with their

tran∣scribed by Sir <HI>Adrian Fortescue,</HI> who was a Descendant from
the Author, and lived in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. for at the End,
it is thus written: <HI>Explicit Liber compilatus &amp; factus per</HI>

<P>THIS most excellent Treatise was written by the Author in the
Language of those Times in which he lived; par∣ticipating much of the Nature
of the <HI>Saxon:</HI> And there∣in are used many Words, Terminations, and
Phrases, no where to be met with in the <HI>Modern English,</HI> which may
therefore seem uncouth and obsolete; but by the <HI>Etymolo∣gical
Remarks</HI> of the <HI>Learned Editor,</HI> these seeming Impro∣prieties
vanish; and the Author appears with great Advan∣tage in his <HI>Native
Dress.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor in his <HI>Dedication</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas
Parker,</HI> Knt. Lord <HI>Chief-Justice</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> having
shewn the Office of <PB N="251" REF="280"/> a <HI>Judge</HI> over the People
of <HI>England</HI>; that he is <HI>Guardian</HI> of their <HI>Laws</HI> and
<HI>Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Mediator</HI> between <HI>Prince</HI> and
<HI>Subject,</HI> extols the great Abilities and Integrity of the
<HI>Author</HI> and of his <HI>Patron</HI> too; and compliments Sir
<HI>Tho∣mas</HI> with this beautiful Simile; 
<Q REND="inline">"That your <HI>Lordship</HI> now appears with
such a Lustre, is, in some measure, owing to your <HI>high
Station;</HI> tho' the latent Cause existed long be∣fore: So the
<HI>Sun</HI> itself when rising, shines only to the <HI>East</HI>; but
is the same with that, which, when elevated to the <HI>Meridian,</HI>
enlightens the whole <HI>Hemisphere.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He then opens his <HI>Preface,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Holland,</HI>
Bart. with the Grand Division of <HI>Law,</HI> into <HI>Divine</HI> and
<HI>Natu∣ral</HI>; and shews that the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>England</HI> comes
nearest to the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Divine</HI>
Pattern. Next he treats of its <HI>Certainty</HI>; proving that <HI>legal
Beings</HI> in general, are capable of the best <HI>Certainty,</HI> even
Demonstration, and Mr. <HI>Lock</HI>'s Notions of <HI>Morality</HI>
applicable to them; and after shews the special Care of the Law of
<HI>England,</HI> in defi∣ning Terms, raising Axioms, drawing Deductions
there∣from, searching the Truth of Facts by Juries of 12 Men, and giving
Judgment upon mature Consideration: Then of its Antiquity; and here he cites
our Author <HI>de Laud. Leg. Angl.</HI> that neither the <HI>Roman</HI> nor
<HI>Venetian</HI> Laws can claim so great Antiquity; and lays down, that all
Laws have their <HI>Origin</HI> from <HI>Nature,</HI> and those that are
founded on her are equally ancient; that the Law of <HI>England</HI>
consists of the Laws of <HI>Nature,</HI> positive
<HI>Institutions,</HI> and <HI>Customs.</HI> That <HI>Ethelbert</HI> the
first <HI>Christian King,</HI> in 561, with the Advice of his
<HI>Wise-Men,</HI> made the first <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws, after the coming of
<HI>Austin</HI> the Monk; and many <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings after him in like
manner, made and confirmed Laws; that <HI>Al∣fred,</HI> first sole Monarch
after the <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> with the Ad∣vice of his <HI>Wise-Men,</HI>
collected the Laws of former <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings into one entire
<HI>Codex</HI> (suppos'd to be the same with the <HI>Dome-Book</HI>) <HI>ut
in Jus Commune totius Gentis transiret</HI>; that his Successors
<HI>Edward</HI> the Elder, <HI>Aethelstan, Edgar, Ethelred,</HI> and
<HI>Canutus</HI> confirmed these Laws, and com∣manded their Judges to give
right Judgment according to the <HI>Dome-Book,</HI> and that the
<HI>Folc-Right</HI> should be preserv'd to all their Subjects: And from
hence the Editor concludes, that the <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>England</HI>
under the Name of <HI>Folc-Right,</HI> existed under <HI>Alfred</HI>; and
that <HI>Edward</HI> the Confes∣sor only collected, as <HI>Alfred</HI> had
done, the Laws then extant, which had not been observed during the
Usurpations of <PB N="252" REF="281"/> <HI>Harold</HI> I. and
<HI>Hardicanute,</HI> and may well be called the Re∣storer of the
<HI>English</HI> Laws; and this he backs with the Oath of <HI>William</HI> I.
to keep inviolable the Laws of the pious Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and
especially King <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI> which, says he, were not only those
enacted in his time, but of all his Ancestors, and the with Confirmation of
King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Laws by <HI>Henry</HI> I. <HI>Stephen, Henry</HI> II.
<HI>Richard</HI> I. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III. and <HI>Magna
Charta,</HI> which as Lord <HI>Coke</HI> ob∣serves, is only a Confirmation of
the <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> He then speaks of the
<HI>Salic</HI> Laws among the <HI>German Franks,</HI> and briefly of the
<HI>English</HI> Constitution. After∣wards he passes to the Author's
Life and Character, his Pe∣digree and Works. Then follows, the Reason of his
Re∣marks on the Author's Language; and here he observes, that 
<Q REND="inline">"tho' an <HI>Etymology,</HI> strictly
speaking, is no more than a Derivation of the Word or Name; yet
<HI>Etymologies</HI> from a <HI>Saxon</HI> Original, will often present you
with a Definition of the thing, in the Reason of the Name."</Q> And this he
illustrates with many remarkable Instances: he likewise gives the
<HI>Etymology</HI> of several <HI>Law-Terms,</HI> particularly

propounded to him in what Art soever: Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> made this
Question to be put to him, whether <HI>Averia capta in Witherna∣mia sunt

neces∣sity, of the knowledge of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Tongue in almost all
Sciences. And gives an account of Books proper for at∣taining it; and to that

<BIBL><HI>The Antiquities and Practice of the</HI> COURT

<P>THUS, the better to understand the Contents of this Work, is its
Title here enlarged; which otherwise is no more than barely
<HI>Exchequer</HI>; as if it were a Part of some larger Performance, which
had a more comprehensive and explanatory Title at the beginning. And this we
are the ra∣ther inclin'd to believe was the Case, in that we have been
inform'd, the late Lord Chief Baron <HI>Gilbert</HI> wrote Two Dis∣courses
upon the Courts of the <HI>King's-Bench</HI> and the <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> and
a Third upon the <HI>Exchequer</HI>; of which last, this, before us, is
presumed to be a Copy. It was certainly wrote by an Author who was familiarly
acquainted with the Laws of this Court, or Course of Practice therein, both
Ancient and Modern; and that it was written since Mr. <HI>Maddox</HI>
pub∣lish'd the <HI>History of the Exchequer,</HI> appears by our Author's
frequent Quotations from it; besides, there is the Form of a Writ of
<HI>Scire Facias</HI> issued under the <HI>Teste</HI> of the said Chief
Baron <HI>Gilbert,</HI> in the fourth Year of his late Majesty's Reign,
recited in the 56th Page of the said MS; which was imparted to us out of the
Collections mention'd in our Account of the MS, we described in our last
Number.</P>
<P>It is divided into Ten Chapters, which for want of room we shall
only repeat, as follows: 1. Shewing that the <HI>Exchequer</HI> was the ancient
and sovereign Court in <HI>Normandy.</HI> 2. How to understand the Revenue
and Business of the ancient <HI>Ex∣chequer.</HI> 3. How, when
<HI>Baronies,</HI> towards the latter end of the Norman Period escheated,
they were wont to be broken in∣to small Tenures. 4. That, in the
<HI>Saxon</HI> Times, the Lords Spi∣ritual held by <HI>Frank Almoigne.</HI> 5.
How the King's Tenants, who held <HI>per Baroniam,</HI> did Suit and Service at
his own Court. 6. How all Debts to the King bind from the Time they are
contracted. 7. What Acts and Instruments pass by the King's Chancellor
under the Broad-Seal. 8. The usual Revenue which arose from Fines and
Amerciaments. 9. The Receipt of the <HI>Exchequer.</HI> 10. The Sheriffs
Accounts; and with this, concludes the Treatise, at least as far as our
Copy extends.</P>

<P>THIS threefold Work is so sufficiently explained in the
Prefaces and Conclusions of its several Parts, that the Reader cannot have
a better Account thereof than by a Recital of them: We shall therefore begin
with his Preface to the first Part, which is as follows.</P>
<Q> 
<P>"Here begynneth the Prohemye upon the reducynge, both out of
<HI>Latyn</HI> as of <HI>Frensshe,</HI> into our <HI>Englyssh</HI> Tongue,
of the Polytyque Book, named <HI>Tullius de Senectute</HI>; which that
<HI>Tullius</HI> wrote upon the Disputations and Commynyca∣cions made to the
puissant Duc <HI>Cato,</HI> Senatour of <HI>Rome,</HI> by <HI>Scipion</HI>
and <HI>Lelius,</HI> then beyng yong noble Knyghtes, and also Senatours of
the said <HI>Rome,</HI> of the Worshippe, Recommendacyon, and Magnyficence
that shold be gyven to Men of olde Age, for theyr Desertes and Experyence
in Wysedom of polytyque Governaunce, and blamed them that reproven or lothen
olde Age; and how <HI>Caton</HI> exhorteth and counseileth olde Men to be
joyful and bere pacyently olde Age, whan it cometh to them: And how
<HI>Tullius,</HI> at reverence of <HI>Caton,</HI> declareth, by ways of
Example, how <HI>Ennius,</HI> thauncyent Philosophre, purposeth and wryteth
in three Verses compendyously unto his Frende <HI>Atticus,</HI> also a
Senatour of <HI>Rome,</HI> how he toke grete Thought and Charge for the
Governaunce of the comyn Prouffyght; for which he deserved grete Lawde and
Honoure, in preferring the same, named in <HI>Latin, Res Publica,</HI> kepyng
the <HI>Romaynes</HI> prosperous, and defendyng them fro theyr Adversaryes
and Rebelles. Whiche Book was translated and thystoryes o∣penly declared by
the Ordenaunce and Desyre of the noble auncyent Knyght, Syr <HI>Johan
Fastolf,</HI> of the Countee of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> Bannerette, lyvyng the Age
of fourscore Yere; excercsyng the Warrys in the Royame of <HI>Fraunce,</HI>
and other <PB N="256" REF="285"/> Countrees, for the Diffence and unyversal
Welfare of bothe Royames of <HI>Englond</HI> and <HI>Fraunce,</HI> by forty
Yeres endurying, the Fayte of Armes hauntyng, and in admynystryng Jus∣tice

IV. <HI>Henry</HI> V. <HI>Henry</HI> VI and was Governour of the Duchye of
<HI>Angeou,</HI> and the Countee of <HI>Mayne,</HI> Ca∣pytayne of many Townys,

havyng the Charge and Saufgarde of them dyverse Yeres, ocupyeng and rewlynge

Regent of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> Duc of <HI>Bedford, Thomas,</HI> Duc of <HI>Exeter;
Tho∣mas,</HI> Duc of <HI>Clarence</HI> and other Lyeutenauntes; prayeng to take
this reducyng pacyently, and submittyng me to the Amendyng and Correction of
the Reder and Understonder, that is disposed to rede, or have any
Contemplacion in thistoryes of this Book, whiche were drawn and compyled out
of the Bookes of thauncyent Phylosophers of <HI>Grece,</HI> as in thorygynal
Text of <HI>Tullius de Senectute</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> is spe∣cifyced

<HI>Englyssh</HI> Tongue, is more ample emnowned, and more swetter to the
Reder, kepyng the juste Sentence of the <HI>Latyn.</HI></P> 
<P>Thence for as moche as this Book thus reduced into our
<HI>English,</HI> is with grete Inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ce, Labour, and Coste comen into myn honde; which I advysedly
have seen over, redde, and considered the noble honeste and vertuous
Mates, ne∣cessarily requysite unto Men stepte in Age, and to yong Men,
for to lerne how they ought to come to the same, to whiche every Man
naturelly desyreth to atteyne. And the Matter and Commynycacion of this
said Book bytwene that wise and noble Man <HI>Cato,</HI> on that one part,
and <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius,</HI> two yonge Knyghtes, on that other
part, is moch behoefful to be knowen to every Man, vertuous, and wel
disposed, of what some ever Eage resonable that he be. Thenne by
cause I have not seen ony of the same here to fore, I have endevoured me
to gete it with grete diffi∣culte, and so gotten, have put it in Enprynte,
and dilygent∣ly, after my lytil Understandyng, corrected it, to thentente
that noble vertuous and wel disposed Men myght have it to loke on, and to
understonde it. And this Book is not re∣quysite, ne eke convenyent, for
every rude and symple <PB N="257" REF="286"/> Man, which undestandeth not of
Science, ne Connyng, and for suche as have not herde of the noble, wise and
grete Lords, Gentilmen, and Marchauntes that have seen, and dayly been
ocupyed in Maters towchying the publyque Weal. And in especial unto them,
that been passed theyr grene Yongthe, and eke their myddle Age, called
Virylyte, and ben approchid unto <HI>Senectute,</HI> callyd olde and auncyent
Eage; wherin they may see how to suffre, and bere the same pacyently; and
what Surete and Vertue ben in the same: And have also cause to be joyous
and glad, that they have escaped and passed, the manyfolde Peryllys and
doubte∣ous Adventures, that ben in Juvente and Yongthe, as in this said Booke
here followyng, ye may more plainly see. Whiche Booke endyted and wrote in
<HI>Latyn,</HI> by the noble Philosopher and Prince of Eloquence,
<HI>Tullius</HI> Consul <HI>Ro∣mayn;</HI> within the Breste of whom,
Phylosophye Naturel and Morall, had chosen her Domicill: Out of whiche it
hath ben translated into <HI>Frensh,</HI> and after into our
<HI>Englyssh</HI> Tongue, as hier after al a longe ye may see.</P> 
<P>Also, whan the said <HI>Tullius</HI> had made his Book, <HI>De
Senec∣tute,</HI> he aftir made another Book, called <HI>De Amicicia,</HI> that
is to say, of Frendship. In which he reherceth of two yong Knyghtes of
<HI>Rome,</HI> that one named <HI>Sevola,</HI> and that other <HI>Faunyus,</HI>
both Sones-in-law unto <HI>Lelius,</HI> a noble Senatour of <HI>Rome,</HI> and
felawe and alyed in Frendship with <HI>Scipio Affrycan;</HI> whiche within
fewe days to fore was deed. How they desyred to knowe of the Frendship that
was be∣tweene the said <HI>Scipio</HI> whyles he lived, and <HI>Lelius</HI>
theyr said Fader-in-law: And of the Disputation in Frendship, as also
playnly it appiereth in the same; which Book was translated by the vertuous
and noble Erle, therle of <HI>Wur∣cestre,</HI> into our <HI>Englyssh</HI>
Tongue. And by cause it is ac∣cordyng and requysite to have Frendship
joyned to olde Eage, I have enprynted the said Book of Frendship, and
annexed to it the Book of Eage; which Book of Frendship is full
ne∣cessary and behoefful unto every Estate and Degree: And aftir, I have
sette in this said Book, followyng them bothe, a Noble Treatys of the
Declaracion of two noble Knyghtes <HI>Romaynes,</HI> in makyng of two Oracions
to sore the Senate, to knowe wherin Noblesse resteth? And thus this
Volume is dyvyded into three particuler Werkes; whiche ben of grate Wysdom in
<HI>old Age,</HI> very Love in <HI>Frendship,</HI> and the Question wherin
Noblesse resteth? Which lytil Volume I have emprysed tenprynte under
the Umbre and Shadowe <PB N="258" REF="287"/> of the noble Protection of our
moost dradde Soverayne and naturel Lyege Lord and moost Cristen Kyng,
Kyng <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the Fourth, to whom I moste humbly byseche to receyve
the said Book of me <HI>William Caxton,</HI> his moost humble Subget and
litil Servaunt, and not to desdeyn to take it of me so poure, ignoraunt,
and symple a Persone: And of his moost bountynous Grace to pardonne me
so pre∣sumyng; beschyng Almyghty God to kepe, mayntene, and graunte to

Desyres: And aftir this short and transitorye Lyf, everlastyng Lyf and

<P>After this general Preface, follows a Table of the Heads in the
first Part or Discourse of <HI>Old Age</HI>; which being al∣most eight
Leaves, is too long to be here recited, and much more any tollerable Abstract
of the Discourse itself; which extending as far as the Printer's Mark
I.2. for this Book has <HI>Signatures</HI> at the bottom of it, though no
<HI>Numbers</HI> on the Pages at top, concludes with these Words:

all them that shall here or rede this lityl Treatys, moch ver∣tuous of

<HI>Tullius,</HI> intitled <HI>De Amycicia,</HI> after that he had achevid his
Boke <HI>De Senectute,</HI> as hertofore ye may more playnly see at large,
thene me semeth it requisite and necessarye that I sette in folowing
the said Book, this Book <HI>De Amicicia,</HI> which, by Goddes Grace, shal
playnly folowe."</Q> This Treatise is marked with <HI>Signatures,</HI> in the
same manner as the former, that is to <PB N="259" REF="288"/> say, an
alphabetical Letter repeated on every Leaf, with a numerical Figure as far as
four, then four Leaves blank without any Signature: so that this Treatise
beginning at A, 1. and ending at D, 4. has 28 Leaves in it, and concludes in
this manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"Thus endeth this Boke, named <HI>Tullius de

also Noble Men of <HI>Rome,</HI> named <HI>Faunyus</HI> and <HI>Sevola.</HI>
In which they desyred him to en∣forme them of the Frendship that was

that be in Frendship, and without Vertue, veray Frendship may not be, as he
prevyth by many Exsamples and notable Con∣clusions, as heretofore is moch

the vertuous and noble Lord and Erle, therle of <HI>Worcestre;</HI> on whoos
Sowle I bechese Almyghty God to have Mercy; and alle ye that shal rede or
here this said Werke, of your Charyte, I beseche you, to praye for hym. And
by cause this said Book, <HI>De Amicicia,</HI> is ful necessarye and
requysite to be had and knowen, I have put it in emprynte, to thentent, that
veray Amyte and Frendship may be had, as it ought to be, in every Estate
and Degree; and Vertue, without whiche Frendship may not be had, may be
encreaced, and Vices eschewid. Thenne whan I had enprynted the Book of Olde
Age, whiche the said <HI>Tullyus</HI> made, me semed it acor∣dyng, that
this said Booke of Frendship shold folowe, by cause ther cannot be
annexed to olde Age a bettir thynge than good and very Frendship: which two
said Bokes here to fore wreton ben of grete Wisdom and Auctoryte, and full
necessarye behoeffull and requysite unto every Age, Estate and Degree.
And that they prouffyte in encrecyng of Vertue, I beseche the blessyd

<P>Lastly, follow the Two <HI>Declarations,</HI> made by
<HI>Publius Cornelius Scipio</HI> and <HI>Gayus Flamyneus,</HI> Competitors for
the Love of <HI>Lucresse</HI>; shewing wherein <HI>True Honour and
No∣bleness consists:</HI> The former placing it in Blood, Riches, 
<PB N="260" REF="289"/> and the worshipful Deeds of his Ancestors, without
urging any thing of his own Life or Manners; the latter insisting, that
Nobleness cannot be derived from the Glory or Merits of another Man, or from
the flattering Goods of Fortune, but must rest in a Man's own proper Virtue
and Glory. After these Orations, which, with the Argument or Intro∣duction,
take up nineteen Leaves, the whole Book is con∣cluded by our Editor in these
Words.

&amp;c.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS Sir <HI>Thomas Elyot,</HI> for his Learning, and vertuous
Accomplishments, was an Honour to the Gentry and Nobility of
<HI>England,</HI> in his Time; and tho' his younger Years were much employed in
Court and State Affairs, es∣pecially certain Embassies into <HI>Italy,
&amp;c.</HI> yet did he apply the Knowledge thereby acquired rather to the
Improvement and Communication of his Studies, than to the more fa∣shionable
Attainments of worldly Riches, Offices and Dignities. He is said, by
<HI>Bale,</HI> to have been the Son of Sir <HI>Richard Elyot,</HI> and born in
<HI>Suffolk</HI>; but his chief House and Estate was at <HI>Carleton</HI>
in <HI>Cambridgeshire</HI>; of which County, we find him in the List of
High Sheriffs, in the 24 and 36th of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and at which Town he
was buried in 1546, having a handsome Monument over his Grave. His Works,
partly original Compositions, partly Translations, from <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Latin,</HI> are all upon grave and important Subjects. They need not, upon
this occasion, be here enumerated, being at least a Dozen in number; 
<PB N="262" REF="291"/> which, perhaps, in little more than so many Years, he
set forth in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue; whereof his <HI>Dictionary</HI>
is not the least considerable. But we may here observe, that the Accounts
which have hitherto been given of them, are very imperfect, especially that
of <HI>Anthony Wood.</HI> As to this Book, named the <HI>Governour,</HI> we
find it to be the first he published; and it has been so well received,
as to have had as many, if not more Editions than any other of his Wri∣tings.
This Edition we make use of, is not mentioned in the Author last quoted;
and its having the Date of 1534, in the ornamental Border, from a wooden Print,
in the Title-Page, gives room to conjecture the Book was first printed that
Year.</P>
<P>It is dedicated by the Author to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and in
his said Proheme, or Dedication, he has these Words, which verify in part
what we have above observed, and at the same time shew you the subject
Matter of his Work. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have now enterprysed to discribe, in our
Vulgare Tonge, the Forme of a just publike Weale; which Mattier I have
gathered, as well of the Saiyings of most noble Autors, (<HI>Greekes</HI> and
<HI>Latines</HI>) as by myne owne Experience; I being continually trained in
some daielye Affaires of the publicke Weale of this your most noble Realme,
almost from my Childhood; which Attemptate is not of Presump∣cion to teache
any Person, I myself having most nede of teachyng; but only to the entent
that Men, which will be studious about the Weale publyque, may find the
thynge thereto expedient, compendiously written. And for as muche as this
presente Boke treateth of the Education of them, that hereafter maie be
deemed woorthy to be <HI>Go∣vernours</HI> of the publike Weal under your
Highnesse, which <HI>Plato</HI> affirmeth to be the first and chief Parte
of a Publike Weal; <HI>Solomon</HI> saiynge also, where Governours be not,
the People shall falle into ruine; I therefore have named it the
<HI>Governour,</HI> and do now dedicate unto youre Hyghe∣nesse, as the
fyrst Fruits of my Study, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>After the Table of Contents, our Author enters upon his Work,
which is divided into Three Books, with explaining the Signification of a
Publick Weal, and why it is called in <HI>Latin Respublica</HI>; giving the
Reason of Government, and shewing why Man, for his Understanding, and the
Honour which is due to it, is best fitted for the same. Further, that one
Sovereign Governor ought to be in a Publick Weal; and what Damage hath
happened, when a Multitude has had <PB N="263" REF="292"/> equal Authority,
without any Sovereign? This is il∣lustrated by many Examples, especially
from our own Hi∣story of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Invasion and Divisions of
this Kingdom, till it was reduced to its primitive Estate, by the noble King
<HI>Edgar:</HI> But here not proposing to describe the Office or Duty of a
<HI>Sovereign</HI> Governor, he distinguishes his In∣tention to treat of
the two Parts of a Publick Weal, named due <HI>Administration</HI> and
necessary <HI>Occupation,</HI> which shall be divided into two Volumes. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the first, saith he, shall be
comprehended the best Form of Education or bryng∣ing up of noble Children
from their Nativitie, in such manner, as thei may be found worthy, and also
able to be Governours of a Publyke Weale. The second Volume, which God
grantyng me Quietnese and Libertee of Minde, I will shortly after sende
forth: It shall conteyn all the Remenant which I can, either by Learnyng or
Experience, find apt to the Perfection of a just Publike Weale; in which, I
shall so endeavour myself, that all Men, of what Astate or Condicion
soo ever thei bee, shall fynde therin Occasion to be alwaie vertuously
occupied, and not without pleasure, yf they be not of the Schools of
<HI>Aristippus,</HI> or <HI>Apitius</HI>; of whom, the one supposed
Feli∣citee to bee onely in Lecherye; the other, in delicate Feedynge and
Gluttonye; from whose sharpe Talones, and cruelle Teethe, I beseeche all
gentyll Readers to defende these Warkes, which for theyr Commoditee is only
compiled."</Q> Then he proceeds to observe in the third Chapter, That in a
Publick Weal there ought to be inferior Governors, called
<HI>Magistrates,</HI> which should be appointed, or chosen by the
Sovereign Governor. In the next Chap∣ter, he treats of the <HI>Education</HI>
or Form of bringing up the Children of Gentlemen, which are to have Authority
in the Publick Weal: so proceeds to the Order of <HI>Learning,</HI> that
Noblemen, in their Minority, should be trained to, and at what Age
<HI>Tutors</HI> should be provided, and what belongs to their Office. In what
wise <HI>Musick</HI> may be necessary to a Nobleman. The Commendation
of <HI>Painting</HI> and Carv∣ing in a Gentleman. The exact Care required in
chusing of <HI>Masters.</HI> The Order to be used in Learning, and which
Authors to be first read. The Reasons why Gentlemen at this time be not
equal in Doctrine to the ancient Noblemen, which are Pride, Avarice, and
Negligence of Parents, with the want or scarcity of sufficient Masters or
Tutors. Here we have a Character of <HI>Henry Beauclerk,</HI> King of
<HI>England,</HI> <PB N="264" REF="293"/> and his Brothers: Also a
Commendation of <HI>Eloquence</HI> and of <HI>Poetry,</HI> with Translations
of some Verses from the ancient Poets, shewing what good Advice, even the
wanton Wri∣ters often contain; and that it were no Reason, for some little
matter that is in their Verses, to abandon therefore all their Works. 
<Q REND="inline">"No wise Man entreth into a Gardein, (sais our
Author) but he soon espieth good Herbes from Net∣tils, and treadeth the
Nettils under his fete, whiles he gadreth good Herbes, whereby he taketh no
damage; or if he be stungen, he maketh light of it, and shortly forgetteth
it: Semblably if he do rede wanton Metter myxte with Wisedome, he putteth the
worst under fote, and sorteth out the best; or if his Courage be stered
or provoked, he remembreth the litteil Pleasure and great Detriment that
shulde ensue of it, and withdrawyng his Mynde to some other Study or
Exercise, shortly forget∣teth it."</Q> From hence, we pass to the
<HI>Law,</HI> and some Observations upon the Improvements to be made in the
Study thereof. The Cause why, at this day, there be in this Realm so few
perfect <HI>School-Masters.</HI> Sundry Forms of <HI>Exercise</HI>
mentioned, as necessary for every Gentleman; some of which are referred
to in <HI>Galen's</HI> Book, <HI>De Sanitate tuenda</HI>; 
<Q REND="inline">"which is translated into <HI>Latine</HI>
wonderfull elo∣quently, by Dr. <HI>Linacre,</HI> late most woorthy
Phisicion to our Most Noble Soveraigne Lord Kyng <HI>Henry</HI> VIII."</Q>
And those mentioned are <HI>Wrestling, Running, Swimming,</HI> Art of
<HI>Defence, Riding</HI> and <HI>Vaulting</HI>; and here speaking of
<HI>Horses</HI> he sais, 
<Q REND="inline">"It is supposed, that the Castle of
<HI>Arun∣del</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> was made by one <HI>Beauvize,</HI>
Erl of <HI>South∣ampton,</HI> for a Monument of his Horse, named
<HI>Arundell,</HI> which in far Countries hadde saved his Maister from
ma∣ny Perils."</Q> Then we come to the ancient <HI>Hunting</HI> of the
<HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>; also of <HI>Hawking</HI>; and next of
<HI>Dancing</HI>; shewing, that it is not all in general to be re∣proved. The
Antiquity of Dancing, and wherefore in the good Order of Dancing, a Man and
Woman dance toge∣ther. How Dancing may be an Introduction to the first moral
Virtue, called Prudence. Of the Motions in Danc∣ing, and what they are called;
as the <HI>Honour,</HI> the <HI>Braul</HI>; with an Explanation of the word
<HI>Maturity</HI>; the <HI>Singles</HI> and <HI>Reprinse,</HI> or Indication
of Circumspection, which gives our Author an Opportunity, under that
Consideration, to deliver a laudatory Character of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
Other Branches of Prudence are also further describ'd, from other 
<PB N="265" REF="294"/> Motions or Steps in Dancing. This ends with a
Criticism on the words <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Discretion,</HI> not
hitherto known in the English Tongue, and of the word <HI>Mansuetude,</HI>
till this time, also unknown in our Tongue; with Reasons for na∣turalizing
Words from the <HI>Romans,</HI> as they did from the <HI>Gre∣cians.</HI> Hence
we pass to other Pastimes, expedient, if mode∣rately used. Here
<HI>Dicing</HI> is shrewdly censured, its ill Conse∣quences expos'd, and
the vicious Motives to it; with Ex∣amples how contemptible it was held by the
Ancients. <HI>Cards</HI> and <HI>Tables</HI> are more favourably censured, as
depend∣ing more on Wit, and trusting less in Fortune; especially were
such Improvements made in these kinds of Gaming, that Knowledge or Science
in higher things might thereby be advanced delightfully, and so as to tender
Study most commodious, whether in military Contentions, or those between
Virtue and Vice, or any other laudable Invention. To this end, is the Game of
<HI>Chesse</HI> commended, and as most pleasant to those Players at
it, who have read the <HI>Moralization</HI> of it, and think thereof in their
Play; which Book is in <HI>English</HI> but very scarce, because few, in
their Play, seek for Virtue or Wisdom. Thus we come to <HI>Shoot∣ing</HI>
in the Long-Bow, which he commends as the principal of all other Exercises,
not only for being more moderate, but more serviceable; having been our
best Defence, and made us most victorious, fam'd, and fear'd, as may be
seen in the Histories of King <HI>Richard</HI> I. and King <HI>Edward</HI>
I. Hence our Author takes occasion to exclaim against the Decay of Archery
in his Time, and the Neglect of putting in Execution those Laws and
Provisions which were made for restoring the same: And here he concludes
the first Book, containing 27 Chapters, and 84 Leaves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> Book begins with laying down such virtuous
<HI>Admonitions,</HI> as should be premeditated by whomsoever is appointed
a Governor of a Publick Weal; with some Ex∣amples produced to prove, that as
the Governor is, such is the People; and more refer'd to in
<HI>History</HI>; the Readers of which, our Author most desires should
be, of all others, Princes and Governors. Those Admonitions our Author would
have delectably written, and set in a Table within the Governor's Bedchamber,
with those Verses of <HI>Claudian</HI> to the Emperor <HI>Honorius</HI>
added, which he has here trans∣lated, and of which we shall give our Reader
only this Taste: 
<Q><PB N="266" REF="295"/> 
<L>What thou <HI>mayst</HI> do, delight not for to know;</L> 
<L>But rather what thing will <HI>become</HI> thee best:</L> 
<L>Embrace thou Vertue, keep thy Courage low,</L> 
<L>And think that always Measure is a Feast.</L></Q> And
just before: 
<Q> 
<L>If Lust or Anger do thy Mind assail:</L> 
<L>Subdue Occasion, thou shalt soon prevail.</L></Q></P>
<P>Then proceeds he to the Exposition of <HI>Majesty,</HI> which
he calls 
<Q REND="inline">"The Fountain of all excellent Manners, the whole
Proportion and Figure of noble State; and is properly a Beauty or Comeliness
in Countenance, Lan∣guage and Gesture, apt to his Dignity, and accommodate to
Time, Place and Company; which like as the Sun doth his Beams, so doth it
cast on the Beholders and Hearers a pleasant and terrible Reverence,"
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Next, we have his Judgment and Advice about the
<HI>Apparel</HI> fit for a Nobleman, who is a Governor or great Counsellor;
also concerning the <HI>Furniture</HI> of his House; the Definition or
Description of true <HI>Nobility,</HI> and whence it took its Deno∣mination;
in which Chapter he has this Allusion: 
<Q REND="inline">"We have in this Realm Coynes, which be called
<HI>Nobles</HI>; as long as thei be sene to be Golde, thei be so called;
but if thei be counterfeited and made in Brass, Coper or o∣ther vile Mettall;
who, for the Print onely, calleth theim <HI>Nobles?</HI> wherby it appereth,
that the Estimation is in the Mettall, and not in the Print or Figure."</Q>
Hence he proceeds to the Praise of <HI>Affability,</HI> and the Use thereof
in every State, more particularly in the Facility of Address or being
spoken to; with Examples of the dismal Condition of a Prince and his Realm,
where Liberty of <HI>Speech</HI> is restrain'd. The notable Virtue of
<HI>Placability</HI> is also here illustrated; and here he gives us at
large, a domestick Example of this Vir∣tue, comparable with the best that
ever was recorded of any other Princes or People, in the notable Story of King
<HI>Henry</HI> the IV. his Thanksgiving to God, upon hearing that the
<HI>Prince of Wales,</HI> afterwards our renowned King <HI>Henry</HI> V. was
committed to Prison, and the Reason thereof; in that he was bless'd with
such a <HI>Judge,</HI> as feared not to ad∣minister, and such a
<HI>Son,</HI> as scorned not to obey <HI>Justice</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Thomas Elyot</HI> quotes no Authority for this curious
Story; and I recollect not any more ancient than his own, in this Book.
<HI>John Speed,</HI> in his <HI>Chronicle,</HI> quotes it from this Place. And
Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> tho' he misquotes our Author, as if it were from Sir
<HI>T. Elyot</HI>'s Chronicle (for no such Book did he ever publish) yet
seems rightly to add, 
<Q REND="inline">"from whom our modern Historians have
transcribed it."</Q> <HI>Shakespear,</HI> in the second Part of his
<HI>Henry</HI> IV. has made a lively Scene of it for the Stage, and enlarged it
with Circumstances, as a Dramatist has a License to do. But
<HI>Stow</HI>'s Computation of the time which the <HI>Chief Justice</HI>
con∣cerned in this Story sat on the Bench, is observed to have been too
much contracted; and <HI>John Trussel</HI>'s Account of King
<HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the V. his Acknowledgment of the said Judge's Justice, as
if he were alive, after the Coronation of that King, is observed not to agree
with the time of the said Chief Justice's Death. For Sir <HI>William
Gascoigne</HI> was this Judge, who committed Prince <HI>Henry</HI> to
Prison, and he was made Chief Justice of the King's-Bench, in the first
of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. according to <HI>Fuller,</HI> as he assures us from
our authentic Records, or 15 of <HI>November</HI> 1401, which was 3 of that
King, according to <HI>Dugdale</HI>; and died on the 17th of <HI>December,</HI>
in the 14th or last Year of that King, which was in 1412, according to the
Date on his Monument in <HI>Harwood</HI> Church in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and
the Pedigree of his Fa∣mily, still in being. What confirms the Truth of this
Story here above-mention'd is, That there is a Medal struck in Com∣memoration
thereof, an Impression of which I have seen. It is not so broad as a
Guinea, has his Name written round it in the old <HI>English</HI> Characters,
with the Image of himself, I suppose, sitting on a Bench by another
Person, and reading to three Au∣ditors before him. Mr. <HI>J.
Hopkinson,</HI> in his MS. Volume of the <HI>Pedigrees of the Yorkshire
Gentry,</HI> has given us a Specimen of this Name's being spell'd more
variously than any other I ever met with. It is upon the said Medal Sir
<HI>Wylliam de Gasquone,</HI> as I remember, but has since been most
generally written <HI>Gas∣coigne</HI>; tho' <HI>Fuller,</HI> who was
acquainted with an accomplished Antiquary in <HI>Record-heraldry,</HI> of the
same Family, and Sur∣name, writes him <HI>Gascoinge.</HI></NOTE>. From
hence we pass to Arguments and Examples, shewing <PB N="267" REF="296"/>
that a Governor ought to be merciful, with the difference between
<HI>Mercy</HI> and vain <HI>Pity.</HI> Here we have the choice Example of Mercy
shewed by the Emperor <HI>Augustus</HI> to his Enemy <HI>Lucius Cinna,</HI>
from <HI>Seneca.</HI> Then he descants upon the other principal Parts of
Humanity; the Excellency of <HI>Benevolence, Patience, Charity,</HI> adorn'd
with many anci∣ent Examples. Of <HI>Beneficence, Liberality,</HI> and
<HI>Prodigality.</HI> The true Description of <HI>Friendship.</HI> The
wonderful History of <HI>Titus</HI> and <HI>Gisippus,</HI> whereby is fully
declared the Figure of perfect Amity, with some Cautions to know a
<HI>Friend</HI> from a <HI>Flatterer.</HI> The Division of
<HI>Ingratitude,</HI> and the Dispraise <PB N="268" REF="297"/> thereof,
with Instances of Kindness in Beasts. Of the E∣lection of Friends, and
the Diversity of <HI>Flatterers,</HI> illustra∣ted also with ancient
Examples and Observations. That many <HI>Friends</HI> are necessary for a
Governor: and herewith ends the <HI>Second Book,</HI> at the 141 Leaf,
containing 14 Chapters.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> and last <HI>Book,</HI> begins with a
Discourse on the noble and most excellent Virtue named
<HI>Justice</HI>; whereupon it is observed from whence the Name of King
first pro∣ceeded; the Distinctions between commutative and cor∣rective
Justice; so proceeds to the first Part of Justice distri∣butive. And
here is first recommended the Love and Honour of <HI>God,</HI> and the
Example of the Gentiles instanc'd, who in such Honour placed the chief Part
of Justice. This leads us to observe the Tranquillity that is caused by
<HI>Devo∣tion,</HI> and to consider the Places consecrated for the same.
Here we have the Justice of raising <HI>Temples</HI> for that purpose,
and offering our Worship therein with convenient <HI>Ceremonies.</HI> Next he
treats of the three Counsellors of Justice, <HI>Reason, Society</HI> and
<HI>Knowledge,</HI> and of its two Enemies, <HI>Violence</HI> and
<HI>Fraud</HI>; with Examples shewing, that Justice ought to be between
Enemies. Distinctions of the Word <HI>Fides,</HI> which is the Foundation of
Justice; as when it may be called <HI>Faith</HI>; when <HI>Credance</HI>;
when <HI>Trust</HI>; also when named <HI>Loyalty,</HI> according to the
<HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Fidelity,</HI> from the <HI>La∣tin</HI>; with several
historical Illustrations of the same. Then we come to that Part of
<HI>Fidelity,</HI> which concerns the keep∣ing of <HI>Promises</HI> or
<HI>Covenants:</HI> and here ends his Discourse upon Justice. So we enter
upon the noble Virtue of <HI>For∣titude,</HI> and the two extreme Vices,
<HI>Audacity</HI> and <HI>Time∣rosity</HI>: more particularly in what Acts
Fortitude consists; and that <HI>Painfulness</HI> is the first
Companion of Fortitude, with ancient Examples verifying the same, according
to the Method hitherto pursued. Thus we come to his Recom∣mendations of
<HI>Patience:</HI> Advice how it may be obtained, and a Remedy against
<HI>Impatience.</HI> Of Patience in sustain∣ing <HI>Wrongs</HI> and
<HI>Rebukes</HI>; also in Repulses, or Hinderance of <HI>Promotion,</HI>
with the Commodities which happen from the Advancement of good Men. Hence we
proceed to the Praise of <HI>Magnanimity:</HI> And in this Chapter, among
other Examples, we have that of King <HI>Edgar</HI>'s Treatment to the King of
<HI>Scots,</HI> who wondered, that himself, and other tall able-bodied
Princes and Commanders, should suffer them∣selves to be subdued by
such a little Body as <HI>Edgar</HI> was: Proving, that by this Virtue, and
not by Chance, he was <PB N="269" REF="298"/> preferred to the Sovereignty over
so brave a People. Here follow the Vices attending this Virtue, such as
<HI>Obstinacy</HI> and <HI>Ambition. Abstinence</HI> and
<HI>Continence</HI> are next treated of, as the Companions of Fortitude; the
former especially with relation to Rewards; with Examples shewing, how
backward good Men have been against being led into the Bondage thereof; and
of the latter, we have also Examples in several eminent Persons. Next of
Constancy, Tempe∣rance and Moderation. Of <HI>Sapience,</HI> and the
Definition thereof. The Signification of the <HI>Muses</HI>; of
<HI>Science</HI>; the <HI>Un∣derstanding.</HI> Of past <HI>Experience,</HI>
and a Defence of <HI>History,</HI> wherefore it is commendable, what it
signifies; with an An∣swer to the Objections of those who would slight
the Ad∣vantages thereof, because it has been sometimes corrupted with
fabulous Inventions. Next we are taught the other Part of Experience or
Practice, necessary in the proper Per∣son of a Governor; and then, as a
Vice necessary to be dis∣couraged in Men in Authority, we have a
Essay upon <HI>De∣traction,</HI> with a Description of the Picture which
<HI>Apelles</HI> painted thereof. Lastly, the three concluding Chapters are
upon <HI>Counsel</HI> and <HI>Consultation,</HI> in what form they ought to
used in a Publick Weale, and what therein ought to be chiefly considered.
As the Choice of good Counsellors, and Regard to be paid them; with the
Method of <HI>Belinger Baldasine,</HI> to discover what would be the
Result of Opinions in Council; and the Matter to be consulted of; in which
Generals are to be considered before Particulars: And with this Head
concludes the third and last Book of this pre∣sent Work; which Book
contains 30 Chapters, and the Volume ends with the Number of Leaves observed
at the Beginning.</P>

<HEAD>XLIV. 
<BIBL>A COLLECTION, HISTORICAL <HI>and</HI> POLITICAL, <HI>of
Let∣ters, Discourses, Memorials,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>concerning several</HI>
Per∣sons <HI>and</HI> Places <HI>of Note, in the Reign of Queen</HI>
ELIZA∣BETH: <HI>Gather'd, chiefly, from the Papers of</HI> HENRY <HI>Earl
of</HI> DERBY, <HI>Lord Lieutenant of</HI> Lancashire <HI>and</HI>
Cheshire, <HI>and one of her Majesty's most Hon. Privy Coun∣cill.
MS.</HI> Fol. 1589. about 280 Pages.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>IT was a Custom, in the Reign when this Collection was made, and
indeed one or two Reigns after, not fuller of Industry than Modesty, and
publick Spirit, for Gentlemen, of good Intelligence, thus to copy over and
transmit in Vo∣lumes to Posterity, so many little, observable and
authentic Memoirs, as otherwise, for their Incongruity, could never have been
preserved; but for their Use have been much prefer'd to our best
Libraries. In a Collection of this kind, there is all the Toil of writing,
which in a continued Hi∣story is employed, but none of the Partiality; all
the Use of Histories compiled for the Press, but none of the Profit: as
if only the Information of After ages were intended thereby; and all Praise,
Reward, or Memory of those, who were Instrumental to it, studiously
declined: For from the Generality of these Collections, which we have seen,
it seldom does appear, otherwise than from what may be pre∣sumed, as in
the present Case, who was the Collector, or the Scribe; or by whom, and for
what end they were set to work; yet the end may be commonly understood in
most of these Collections; seeing many Particulars may be too well
<HI>known,</HI> or contain too much <HI>Truth,</HI> or be Matter of too
<HI>private</HI> a Concern, or need the further Illustration of
corresponding <HI>Authorities,</HI> to be put in print in their Collectors
own Time; but transmitted thus, in a <HI>Miscella∣ny,</HI> or Cluster of
indifferent Matters, they are preserved, like Fruits that find a Safeguard in
their own Leaves, till they arrive at that Maturity, in which it is fit they
should be, oc∣casionally, gathered for publick Use.</P>
<P>The present Collection, may, perhaps, as to some Parts of it,
be looked upon in this light. Tho' the Transcriber's <PB N="271" REF="300"/>
Name does not directly appear, several Parts of the <HI>Collec∣tion</HI> may
sufficiently authorise the <HI>Title</HI> we have drawn out for it, as
above. The Period of Time it relates to, may be comprehended between the Years
1584 and 1589; they being the earliest and latest Dates we find therein;
and hence have we settled the Date in the said Title we have given it; as
believing nothing in the Book to be written below that Year. It begins with a
Letter from the Privy Council to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> informing him
of her Majesty's Pleasure, that the six hundred Foot, and thirty-two
Demilances to be levied for the Service in the North out of the County of
<HI>Salop,</HI> should be taken out of the trained Numbers only, in respect
of the present Necessity, and the Importance of the Service wherein they
are to be employ'd; also censuring some Negligence in his Lordship's
Care for her Majesty's Service, touching the Certificates of his Deputy
Lieutenants of <HI>Salop</HI> and <HI>Wigorne</HI>; for that the Provisions
and Weapons they had supply'd were nothing an∣swerable to Expectation. And
further, desiring his Lord∣ship's Opinion, if the contagious Sickness now
at <HI>Ludlow</HI> should continue, whether her Majesty's Houshold
should be removed to some other Place, and his Lordship not repair into
<HI>Wilts</HI> till it was over, &amp;c. This is the Substance of the said
Letter, which is subscribed with the Names of some Privy Counsellors;
but the Leaf is so much damaged, and the Writing blinded by some Wet which
has befaln it, that all we can further read, and this with great Difficulty, is
the Name of <HI>Comptroller, Chamberlain</HI> and <HI>Walsingham</HI>; but
may guess, from the hazardous Times spoken of in it, that it was written at
the first arming of the Nation against the <HI>Spanish</HI> Invasion,
about the Year 1586. The next Piece, is a remarkable Letter from the Earl of
<HI>Leycester,</HI> then Governour of the Low Countries, to Sir <HI>Thomas
Hennage,</HI> dated the 23d of September 1586, beginning thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"Sithens my other Letters of the 20th, yt fell
oute that yester∣day Morninge some Intelligence was broughte, that the
Enemie was bringing a Convoye of Victuall, garded with 300 Horse. There was
sente out to ympeache yt, 200 Horse and 300 Footemen, and a Nomber more
both Horse and Foote to second them: Among other young Men my Nephew Sir
<HI>Philip Sydney</HI> was, and the rather for that the Coronell
<HI>Norrice</HI> himselfe went with the Stande of Footemen, to second the
rest; but the Van∣gard of the Prince was marched and came with this Con∣voye,
<PB N="272" REF="301"/> and being a mystie Morninge, our Men fell into the
Ambuscade of Footemen, who were 3000, the moste Musketts, the reste
Pykes. Our Horsemen being for∣moste by their haste indeede, woulde not
turne, but paste throughe and charged the Horsemen that flede at the backe
of their Footmen so valientlie, as albeyt they were 1100 Horse, and of the
verie Chieffe of all his Troupes, they brake them, being not 200. Many of our
Horses hurt and killed, among which was my Ne∣phewes owne. He wente and
changed to another, and woulde needes to the Charge again, and onste paste
those Musketters; where he receyved a sore Wounde upon his Thighe, three
Fingers above his Knee, the Bone broken quite in Peeces; but for whiche Chance,
God did send such a Daye as I thinke was never many Yeres seene, so
fewe againste so many."</Q> Here the Earl proceeds to enumerate the
Commanders and other Persons of Distinc∣tion in this Rencounter, whose
Names were Colonel <HI>Nor∣rice,</HI> who had the Charge of the Foot, my Lord
of <HI>Essex,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Perrot,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"and my unfortunate <HI>Phillip,</HI> sais he,
with Sir <HI>William Russell,</HI> and divers Gentlemen, and not one hurte
but only my Nephew. They killed four of their Enemies chief Leaders, and
carried the valient Count <HI>Hannibal Gonzaga</HI> away with them upon a
Horse; also took Captain <HI>George Cresier,</HI> the principal Soldier
of the Camp and Captain of all the <HI>Albanez.</HI> My Lord
<HI>Willoughbie</HI> overthrew him at the first Encounter, Horse and Man.
The Gentleman did acknowledge it himself. There is not a properer Gentleman
in the Worlde to∣wards than this Lord <HI>Willoughbie</HI> is; but I can hardly
prayse one more than another, they did all so well; yet every one had his
Horse killed or hurt."</Q> And it was thought very strange, 
<Q REND="inline">"that Sir <HI>William Stanley,</HI> with 300 of
his Men should pass in spight of so many Muskets, such Troops of
Horse, three several Times, making them remove their Ground, and to return
with no more Loss than he did. Albeyt, I must say (continues the Earl) yt
was too much Loss for me, for this young Manne was my greateste Comforte
next her Majestie of all the Worlde, and if I could buy his Lieffe with all I
have, to my Sherte, I woulde geve yt. How God will dispose of him I know
not, but feare I must needes, greately, the worste; the Blow is in so
dangerous a place, and so great; yet did I never heare of any Manne that did 
<PB N="273" REF="302"/> abide the dressinge and settinge his Bones better
than he did: And he was carried afterwards in my Barge to <HI>Arnheim,</HI> and
I heare this Daye he ys still of good hearte, and comforteth all aboute him
as much as maye be. God of his Mercie graunte me his Lieffe, which I cannot but
doubt of greately. I was abrode that tyme in the Fielde, givinge some Order
to supplie that Business, which did indure almoste twoe Owres in
continuall Fighte; and metinge <HI>Phillip</HI> commynge upon his Horsebacke,
not a lytle to my Greafe. But I woulde you had stode by to heare his most
loyall Speeches to her Majestie; his con∣stant Minde to the Cause, his
lovinge Care over me, and his moste resolute Determmation for Deathe, not
one Jott appalled for his Blow; which ys the moste greevous that ever I
sawe with such a Bullet; ryding so, a longe myle and a halfe, uppon his
Horse, ere he came to the Campe; not ceasing to speak still of her
Majestie; be∣ing glad, yf his Hurte and Deathe mighte any waye ho∣nour her
Majestie; for her's he was whileste he lyved, and God's he was sure to be
yf hee dyed: Prayed all Men to thinke that the Cause was as well her
Majestie's as the Countrie's; and not to be discoraged, for you have
seene suche Successe as maye encorage us all; and this my Hurte is the
Ordinance of God, by the happe of the Warre. Well I praye God, yf yt be his
Will, save me his Lieffe; even as well for her Majestie's Ser∣vice sake,
as for myne own Comforte."</Q> These are the Earl's Words, concerning his
said worthy Nephew; and we thought it wou'd be excusable to transcribe
thus parti∣cularly all he has there said of Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> being
a Man of such particular Merit; even tho' it should oblige us to be the
more general and concise in succeeding Topicks. The rest of the Letter,
above a Page of small Writing more in folio, relates to the Account of their
Enemies Retreat, the Prisoners taken, and the chief <HI>Spaniards</HI> who
were at the Charge, with the Number of their Forces; the hazard∣ous Enterprizes
of the Lord <HI>North,</HI> who tho' bruised on the Knee with a Musket-Shot,
yet leaving his Bed, hastned to this Skirmish, one Boot on and t'other off,
and went to the Matter very lustily: Also of two hopeful young Gentlemen in
the Camp, Mr. <HI>Hatton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Umpton,</HI> who were as ready in the
Service as the meanest Soldiers, and got with their Pikes into their
Fore-ranks, under <HI>Row∣land Yorke,</HI> to second Sir <HI>William
Stanley</HI>'s Company; <PB N="274" REF="303"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"and till we see what the Prince will do,
these notable young Fellows, sais the Earl, will not away:"</Q> And to this
Effect ends the Letter: Signed <HI>Robte: Leycester.</HI></P>
<P>The next Piece may be entitled, <HI>Arguments for the sud∣den
Execution of</HI> Mary <HI>Queen of</HI> Scots. We have not Leisure now to
examine whether it has ever been printed, nor can we certainly say that the
Earl aforesaid was the Au∣thor of it; therefore shall only observe, that
it here makes four Pages, and begins with these Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"It may seeme a vayne Labor to goe about to
heape upp Reasons for the persuadinge of that which is of such
Necessitie, as yt were againste all Reason any waye to thinke it mighte
be desuaded."</Q> It is written in the same Hand with the former, and
followed by another Letter of the said Earl's writing, giving a further
Account to some Nobleman here in <HI>England,</HI> of their Success in
winning a Town by Battery, and the Enemies yielding before Assault; in
breaking their Horsemen in a most valiant Skirmish; get∣ting from their
Footmen two most strong Forts by Assault, and making them forsake the
third by Night, the Prince himself being at hand with his whole Army; and
never at∣tempting after the first Skirmish to empeach them: Which he only
speaks in general of here, expecting the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> or
some other that come over, will be more particu∣lar. And now that the Prince
is retired, intends to dismiss his Army into Garrison, and make a Skip
over to see his Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Dated at the Camp, 14
<HI>Octo.</HI> 1586. After this, we have a Letter, signed <HI>Richard
Hollande,</HI> to a noble Lord, intreating that his Lordship would be
present at the hearing of a Cause in the Star-Chamber, wherein his
Bro∣ther-in-Law, Mr. <HI>Dokenfield</HI> was concerned: Tis dated from
<HI>Heaton,</HI> 3 <HI>May,</HI> 1586. And then follows, <HI>Queen</HI>
Eli∣zabeth's <HI>Speech in Parliament,</HI> also the same Year,
<HI>con∣cerning the Form of proceeding against the Queen of</HI> Scots; and
the Delay of her immediate Answer to their Petition for the Execution of the
said Queen, till she had first, 
<Q REND="inline">"with earnest Prayer, beseeched his divine
Majesty, so to illuminate her Understanding, and inspire her with his
Grace, as she may do and determine that, which shall prove to the
Establishment of his Church, preservation of their Estates, and
Prosperity of this Commonwealth under her Charge."</Q> This Speech
consists of four Pages and a half, and begins with these Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"The bottom∣less Graces and immeasurable
Benefits bestowed upon me <PB N="275" REF="304"/> by Almighty God, are and
have been such, as I must not only acknowledge them, but also admire
them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> The next is Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Speech, in
<HI>answer to the French Ambassador, Monsieur</HI> Believre, <HI>and
the rest of his Company,</HI> justifying her Proceedings against the
Queen of <HI>Scots.</HI> It begins thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"My Lords Ambassadors, I trust so much
upon the Goodness of the King my good Bro∣ther, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> And
therein her Majesty sais; 
<Q REND="inline">"I assure you, that all the Sorrows and
Afflictions which ever I did receive, as concerning the Deaths of the King my
Father, the King my Brother, and the Queen my Sister, have not been such a
Grief unto my Heart as the Matter we speak of. I call God to witness if
ever I would use her as she hath done me: All this I take upon my Salvation
or Damnation. I have seen many Histories, and read I be∣lieve as many, I
believe, as any Christian Prince or Prin∣cess, but I never found one Matter
like unto this. I re∣member well your Discourse, and all that you have
al∣ledged unto me, but it cannot intice me to change my Will,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> Then follows the most sorrowful and de∣sperate
Letter of <HI>Margaret,</HI> Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> to Mon∣sieur de
<HI>Sarlant,</HI> complaining of the Queen her Mother's abandoning her to
shameful Ruin; and protesting, 
<Q REND="inline">"That as her Heart wou'd not let her fall into the
Hands of her Enemies alive, she would never eat more; and that the first News
her Mother shoud hear of her shoud be her Death."</Q> After this we have,
<HI>The Booke of the whole Navie,</HI> containing the Names of all the Queen's
Majestie's Shippes, with their Tonnage, and nomber of Mariners, Gun∣ners and
Souldiers the 27 of <HI>December,</HI> 1585. From hence we learn the <HI>Royal
Navy</HI> then consisted of 36 Ships; that the biggest, named the
<HI>Triumph,</HI> was of 1000 Tun Burden, carried 350 Mariners, 50 Gunners, and
200 Soldiers. Of the rest, two were of 900 Ton, one of 800, one of 650, and
seven of 500, so lessening down to 20 Ton some of them. This List
is followed with a Discourse, entitled, <HI>An Analogie or Resemblance
between</HI> Joan <HI>Queene of</HI> Naples, <HI>and</HI> Mary <HI>Queen
of</HI> Scotland. It consists of three Leaves; and the Facts or
Circumstances are drawn for Queen <HI>Joan,</HI> chiefly from <HI>Ran.
Collenutius,</HI> Lib. 5. <HI>de Regno Neapolitano; Pet. Mexia in vita
Vencelai; Platina</HI>; and <HI>Leonardus Areti∣nus, in Historia
Florentina;</HI> and those for Queen <HI>Mary</HI> are gather'd from
<HI>Buchanan, de Nuptiis Mariae,</HI> also his History of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and her own Letters. This is followed with 
<PB N="276" REF="305"/> an <HI>Addition</HI> to the said <HI>Analogy,</HI> of
17 Pages; containing historical Examples or Precedents of Sovereign Princes
be∣ing condemned and put to death, in a formal and advised Manner; in the
Stories of Queen <HI>Joan</HI> aforesaid, who was deliberately executed by
<HI>Charles,</HI> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> thro' the Advice of <HI>Lewis</HI>
King of <HI>Hungary</HI>; and <HI>Conradine</HI> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> who
was in like manner condemned and publickly executed; and the most Christian
<HI>Constantine,</HI> who put to death the Emperor <HI>Licinius,</HI> with a
Comparison between this Case and that of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>; and
here we have a Book of this Queen's referr'd to, called <HI>Expetit.
Causa∣rum,</HI> &amp;c. Then follows a second Precedent of an Em∣peror,
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> who put the King of <HI>Thrace</HI> to death, as we have it
in <HI>Livy, Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI>: Also a third Pre∣cedent in
the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who deprived <HI>Robert</HI> King of
<HI>Naples,</HI> and gave Sentence of Death against him. Nay, we have
several Examples also produced of Popes, who cannot err, as themselves
affirm, giving their Judg∣ment for the putting of Kings to death; as of Pope
<HI>Clement</HI> IV. against <HI>Conradine,</HI> King of <HI>Sicily</HI>;
also Pope <HI>Boniface,</HI> who put Pope <HI>Caelestine</HI> to death,
lest he shou'd, for his singular Virtue, be called again to the See; and
Pope <HI>Urban</HI> VIII. who not only put to death eight Cardinals, who are
accounted part of his Body, called his Brethren, and in Offence to whose
Persons, the Crime of Treason lies, according to <HI>Gigas</HI> and
<HI>Julius Clarus,</HI> but carried three of their Carkasses, dried in an
Oven, about with him in Portmanteaus, and had their purple Hats born up before
him, in terror to others; which Examples, and others, are taken from
<HI>Collenutius, Guildefingense, Corn. Agrippa, Platina, Pedro Mexia,
Augustine,</HI> besides some from the ancient <HI>Romans;</HI> and
confirming Authorities from <HI>Hugoline, Johan. Delignano,</HI> and others;
and all to encourage the execution of the unquiet Queen of <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>The next Piece is a Letter of a private Nature, from Sir
<HI>Edward Standley</HI> to my Lord his Brother, intreating him to move the
Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> to make his Friend <HI>John Kine</HI> a
Proctor of the Arches; and contains some Acknowledgments for the receipt of
some Monies from his <HI>Lordship</HI> for his Charges in a Law-Suit: It is
dated from <HI>Winwycke,</HI> 29 <HI>December,</HI> 1586. And then fol∣lows
<HI>Liber Pacis</HI> 1584; or <HI>the Names of all the Justices of
Assize</HI> in the several Counties of <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Wales.</HI> This List, in double Columns, takes up 29 Leaves. After this,
<PB N="277" REF="306"/> we have another List, which is called also, <HI>a
Book of the Number, Names, and Burden of all the Ships, Barques, and
Vessels, with the Names of all Masters and able Mariners belonging
thereto, within or appertaining to the River of</HI> Chester. It was written
by <HI>William Wale,</HI> the Mayor, at the Command of the Earl of
<HI>Derby</HI>; to whom it is addres∣sed in an Epistle, by the said
Mayor; bearing Date 18 <HI>February,</HI> 1586; and it appears in these
Lists, that the Number of Ships, Barques, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Burden of
twen∣ty, to sixty Tons, were fifteen in Number; and that the Owners,
Masters, and Mariners, with the Places of their abode are named, and number'd
at 152. To this is joined, the like Account of all the Barques,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> belonging to the River of <HI>Preston,</HI> (in
<HI>Lancashire</HI>) called the Water of <HI>Rible</HI>; and this is
perform'd by <HI>Laurence Walle,</HI> Mayor of <HI>Preston,</HI> at the
Command of the said Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> he being Lord Lieutenant also
of this County, as appears by this Mayor's Letter to his Lordship. This
List of Vessels is contained in one Page; and they are eight in Number,
from the Bur∣den of four to ten Ton. The like Book or List of all the
Vessels belonging to the River <HI>Wyer</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> as
well abroad as at home, with their Burden, Masters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is
ad∣dressed to the said Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> according to his Com∣mand,
the same Year, by <HI>Henry Butler,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>William
Skillicorne,</HI> Gent. The Number of these Vessels are 28, and the
Burden between four and eighteen Ton. This is followed with such another
Account of the Vessels, be∣longing to the Peele of <HI>Foodre</HI> and the
Creeks thereof, in <HI>Fournes</HI> and <HI>Cartmeale,</HI> within the said
County of <HI>Lanca∣shire</HI>; directed to the said Earl of
<HI>Derby,</HI> the same Year, according to his Command, by <HI>John
Bradley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>John Richardson,</HI> Gent. They are
but five Vessels in Num∣ber, from the Burden of two to twenty Ton. And to
this is joined one more such List of all the Vessels in the Port of
<HI>Liverpoole,</HI> in the said County, taken the same Year; with the
Names of the Places they were bound to; the Owners, Mariners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
They appear to be twenty-eight in Number, and from eight to forty Ton Burden.
Then follows a Note concerning the intire <HI>Subsidy,</HI> and the two
<HI>Fifteenths</HI> and <HI>Tenths</HI> granted in Parliament; the first
Pay∣ment whereof was to be in <HI>November</HI> next (<HI>viz.</HI> 1587) and
the second in <HI>November</HI> 1588: With the Manner of appointing the
Collectors thereof. After this we have a <HI>Letter from Captain</HI> A.
Cosbye, dated at <HI>Utrecht</HI> the 16 <PB N="278" REF="307"/>
<HI>February,</HI> 1586, to Sir <HI>William Stanley</HI>; advising him to
retain the Town of <HI>Deventer</HI> for her Majesty's Use,
not∣withstanding the Contentions between him, and <HI>Taxis</HI> for the
Government, or the Expectation of great Forces from the Prince to remove him;
as what will no doubt recover his Credit, Pardon, and her Majesty's Favour:
And offers himself to be employ'd into <HI>England</HI> to further this
Service. The next Paper is <HI>a List of all the Soldiers and Munition in the
Castle of</HI> Russhen <HI>and</HI> Castle Peele <HI>in the Isle
of</HI> Man, directed to the Earle of <HI>Derby,</HI> with a Note at the Bottom
of all the Provisions wanting there, which it is hoped his Lordship will
speedily supply: And to this is joyned <HI>the Num∣ber of all sort of
serviceable Men within the said Island.</HI> Here it appears, the Number
of Horsemen were 41, Calli∣ver-men 18, Bow-men 286, and Bill-men 357; but all
much unprovided with Weapons and other Furniture, as appears by a Note of their
Wants, at bottom; signed by <HI>R. Sherburne, H. Scarisbricke, W. Lucas, T.
Burscoghe,</HI> and <HI>H. Radclyff.</HI> The next, is, <HI>A particular
Valuation of</HI> Gud∣disden Demain; where it appears that the Sum total of
Acres is 352, and the total Value <HI>per Annum</HI> 113 <HI>l.</HI>
14<HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d.</HI> To this is joined, a Particular also of <HI>St.
Leonard's Rents</HI>; being 33 Shillings. Then follows a strange Account of
Madam <HI>St. Marcian</HI>'s Vision, on <HI>April</HI> 18, 1587, being
<HI>Shrove-Tuesday,</HI> of three Ladies, with Hawks on their Hands, hawking
as it were at Sheep in the Meadow before her; but being sent to, the
Messenger cou'd see nothing. The Lady with other of her Company still
seeing them from her Chamber, sent again, but no body appeared: She,
still seeing them, and fearing some Violence, sent a number of Men with
Arms, charging them to fire at whatever they saw; they found at last a Cow,
but that vanished from them; at which instant Madam <HI>St. Marcian</HI>
and her Com∣pany saw the three Ladies with their Hawks, Sheep, Cow,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all throw themselves headlong, with great noise into the
River, out of which a Flock of Swallows mounted into the Air: At the same
instant also, the Mayor of <HI>Saints in Xanctoign</HI> coming through a
Meadow near the Town, saw three fair Ladies kneeling and eating of Grass;
of whom taking pity, he invited them to better Fare, but they made him
reproachful Answers; yet he invited them again afterwards by his Servant,
whom they also answered dtsdainfully, wishing him to be gone, saying,
<HI>we are Three whose Names are Death, Famine, and Pestilence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="308"/>Then follows <HI>the Warrant of Sir Peter
Leigh,</HI> Provost-Marshal of <HI>Lancashire</HI> and
<HI>Cheshire,</HI> and Justice of the Peace, to the Keeper of
<HI>Chester</HI> Goal, to receive and de∣tain therein the Body of
<HI>Randulph Northburie,</HI> Husband∣man, for very heinous and slanderous
Words spoken against <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI>; dated at
<HI>Lyme</HI> in <HI>Handley,</HI> 26 <HI>April,</HI> 1587. And next we have
<HI>the Charge that is given to the Queste of Howsehoulde, as well at the
Castle, as at the Peele,</HI> (in the Isle of <HI>Man</HI>) with particular
Instructions to the Officers there; in one Sheet. After this we have <HI>an
Ad∣dress from Cambridge</HI> to the Lord Treasurer <HI>Burghley,</HI>
Chan∣cellor of that University, to rectify some Grievances there∣in
mentioned; signed by nineteen Persons, among whom are <HI>John Bentley,
John Weston, Rob. Russel, Will. Gager, Jo. Holland, Leonard Hutton, John
King, Tho. Crane, Rich. Thorneton,</HI> &amp;c. Then follows a Transcript of
some <HI>Letters</HI>: The first of which is from the Earl of
<HI>Leycester</HI> to a Friend, concerning some Persons who had, as he
in∣timates, wrongfully treated or represented him in his Ab∣sence, of whom
he sais: 
<Q REND="inline">"Touching my Lord <HI>Buckhurst, Norris,</HI>
and <HI>Wilkes,</HI> I doubt not but her Majesty and my Lords do
sufficiently understand of their Doings by this: For dealing with
<HI>Wilkes,</HI> to have his Resolution I desire it not, nor like not to
deal with so ungrateful and un∣thankful Wretches; let him and they do their
worste; they shall be found as they are, and I as I am, I trust. The
Bruits touching <HI>Sluce,</HI> if they be ill, and believed against me I
have the more Wrong; I will never write three Lines to satisfie such
Persons; I know I have done as much as any lyving in my Place, and it
sufficeth me that I know it to be so: I am sorry my Friends should be
troubled to excuse me, when in Conscience I have done all that became me. I
have deserved better of my Coun∣trymen's Hands than lightly to believe of me:
But they shall seke another hereafter to deal as I have dealt for them, if
they reward me so, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Dated from <HI>Dorte,</HI> 22
<HI>August,</HI> 1587."</Q> The next is a Letter to the Earl of
<HI>Derby,</HI> signed by the Vicar of <HI>Great Marlow</HI> in
<HI>Buckingham∣shire,</HI> whose Name was <HI>Thomas Browne,</HI> and the
Church∣wardens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> testifying, That, <HI>Jane Boulde,</HI>
(Wife of <HI>Richard Boulde</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) who was reported to have
absented herself from the Church, and not to use the same accord∣ing to
the Injunctions thought meet, did frequent his Church, tho' it was two Miles
distant from her House at <PB N="280" REF="309"/> <HI>Harleford</HI>; and
she had been out of order: Dated 12 <HI>April</HI> 1587. The next is a Letter
from <HI>Arthur Aty,</HI> to the Right Honourable Mr. <HI>John Wooley,</HI> of
her Majesty's Privy Council; shewing what indifferent Opinion was held of
the <HI>English</HI> Aids in <HI>Holland,</HI> as if 
<Q REND="inline">"her Majesty had already agreed upon the
Conditions of Peace with the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> and that she would
endeavour to enforce the <HI>States General</HI> thereunto, as he had heard
from Monsieur <HI>Aversons,</HI> Secretary to the said States. And though
his Lord (<HI>Leicester</HI> we suppose) had travell'd much about to the
Towns, with great Diligence, instill'd the most ho∣nourable Thoughts of her
Majesty, and brought the Mat∣ter in good Terms, as well for Satisfaction of
those who are misled, as to encourage their treating with her Majesty in
the Peace, yet thinks it will be very difficult; for most who mislike the
Peace, or <HI>England,</HI> or him, seek no∣thing more than to abase his
Credit, upon the surmised Grounds before written, and the earnest
Pressing of the said Peace from <HI>England</HI>; which yet, he hopes,
will do well this Way; but in his Opinion, wou'd have fall'n out the other Way
his Lordship first took, to her Majesty's good liking, tho' not in
haste, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> 'Tis dated at the <HI>Haghe,</HI> 15
<HI>Octob.</HI> 1587.</P>
<P>After these Letters, we have the Answer of <HI>Christopher
Sothworthe,</HI> Priest, (born in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> Son of Sir <HI>John
Sothworthe,</HI> and aged 31 Years) to several Articles against, and
Examinations of him; which Answer he made before Dr. <HI>White,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Beacon, Rich. Topclyff,</HI> and <HI>Rich. Yonge</HI>; whereby it appears,
that he being earnestly required to conform himself in Religion according
to the Laws of her Majesty, now established, refused utterly, saying,

<Q REND="inline">"He is taught that Doctrine and Religion at
<HI>Rome,</HI> wherein he will stand and hopeth to die."</Q> These
Answers contain three Pages. Then follows two Letters by the Earl of
<HI>Leicester</HI> to Mr. <HI>Woolley</HI> aforesaid; both written from the
Low Countries. From the first, consisting of six Pages, we learn, That
Mr. <HI>Woolley</HI> had conveyed to her Majesty his Lordship's
Replications to the Lord <HI>Buckhurst,</HI> Sir <HI>John Norris,</HI> and
<HI>Wylkes</HI>; and that he had advised his Lordship not to be severe in
following Revenge, for her Majesty hath them still in her Displeasure;
and they give it out that it is only for his Lordship's Cause. In this
Letter he fur∣ther declares, they have Friends to help them to execute their
foul Facts; and he, few to help to deliver him in his <PB N="281" REF="310"/>
just Defence: And asks what he should have been thought of if he had left
their Declaration unanswered. That in what her Majesty has spared them
for herself, they ought the more to acknowledge it, and what she laid upon
them for his Sake, he is upon his Knees, with all Humbleness, to yield most
dutyful Thanks. As to his Successor that is talked of, and whether he was
to be Governor General as his Lordship is, or only have the Government over
her Majesty's People there, he thinks it will soon be resolved; for that
the States have found such a sweet Taste in com∣manding as well Men as
Money, that they will hardly yield to any more Governors till they must by
force; therefore that it shou'd be seen his Lordship would be the last.
We are here informed also, of the Dispute his Lordship had with the
States, about the Payment of the 5000 Men he carried over with him. Also
concerning <HI>Sluce</HI> Haven, what he has written about it, and Mr.
<HI>Beal</HI> is to deliver. And that nothing can be done but by Count
<HI>Maurice,</HI> of whose bad Dealing her Majesty doth know. That the Talk
of Peace holds all Things in suspence: That it is greatly press'd by
some, to make it conceived, that it will be better for themselves to deal
by themselves, than to join with her Majesty; and herein doth
<HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Hollock</HI> join and practice for life against her,
as they have done ever since his Lordship came over; and that he shall
hazard some∣what to impeach their Doings, as he intends. And a lit∣tle
further: 
<Q REND="inline">"What a Tyme of Faction I have suffered! and now
more than ever; for that the Assurance of Peace dothe drawe many from me
and my Authoritie, and so falleth it out every Day more manifeste than
other. I am here withoute eyther Nobleman, Officer, or Coun∣cellor.
<HI>Killigrewe</HI> I am fayne to leave at <HI>Hage,</HI> where the Councel
are; my self, for her Majesties Service, to wander upp and downe, bothe in
daylie Danger of my Lyffe, and yet withoute so doing shoulde not be able to
staye Men's Mindes as they ought to bee. And if her Majesties Letter had
bene delivered to the <HI>States</HI> that <HI>Atye</HI> broughte, never Man
had receyved so undeserved a Shame as I had, and utterlie dishonoured her
own Do∣ing withall. Such Comfort I am subject unto! And all this while not
one Person sent over to confirm my Doings, which were meet so to bee; nor
to expostu∣late to these Men as it had bene convenience, in so dan∣gerous
a Tyme as this ys, for yt ys not the haste of Peace, <PB N="282" REF="311"/>
nor the Shewes of yt that will bring such a Peace as should bee,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> This Letter is signed with the Earl's Name, and dated 3
of <HI>Octob.</HI> 1587. The next Letter by the said Earl to the same
Person, informs us, That this Peace in hand begins to make great War in
those Parts, for that none wou'd hear of it but such as wholly depend∣ed on
her Majesty. And here he further expresses his Un∣easiness under his
Charge, thus, 
<Q REND="inline">"I assure you my Lyffe was never wearisome
to me till nowe: I woulde my Estate here were eyther felte, hearde, or
understood; I knowe, of so many professed Friendes as I have, I shall
finde some woulde seeke to releyve yt."</Q> And further, that he was near
<HI>Horne</HI> in <HI>North Holland,</HI> and means to stay a few Days
thereabouts; desires to be excused to the Lords, for that all his
Secretaries are employ'd abroad; hopes to hear from him speedily the
blessed Sound of Retreat; that he is dispatching the Soldiers as fast
home as he can; that he trusts the Lords will consider how little Cause
he has to stay there any longer, except, now he has worne out all his
Company, they intend he shall weare out himself. So ends, in haste, the 9
of <HI>Octob.</HI> 1587.</P>
<P>Then follow some more private Accounts, relating chief∣ly to the
Estates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> as we gather by
Circumstances; beginning with <HI>a Note of the Particu∣lars of my Lord's
Stand at</HI> Pilkington: This is an Inven∣tory of the Goods or Furniture in
the Apartments there. The next Paper is <HI>an Account of Wood sold</HI>; in
this Method. The first Column contains the Names of the Commission∣ers;
the next, the Names of the Woods; the next, the Year when sold, and the
Valuation; next, the Earnest Mo∣ney; and lastly, Earnest Money received.
These Woods were named <HI>Stretlie, Gorynge, Burciter, Middleton</HI> and
<HI>Arn∣cot; Whichford, Ardington, Brackley, Gadesden</HI> and
<HI>Wyn∣nington:</HI> And the Sales were made between the 25 and 28th Years of
the Queen's Reign. To this is added, a se∣parate Paper of the <HI>Earnest
of my Lord's Woods</HI> for those Years, the Sum total whereof is 108
<HI>l.</HI> 9 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> To this is also join'd, <HI>an
Account of the riding Charges allowed by the Auditors to the Commissioners,
for sale of the sad Woods</HI> in those three Years. And this is followed
with <HI>Orders set down by my Lord, for Earnest Money due unto his
Lordship for the Sale of Woods.</HI> These Orders are agreed to by the
Commissioners aforesaid, whose Names are <HI>Tho. Harte, Edw. Clarke,
Jam. Kenwicke</HI> and <HI>Edw. Gunne:</HI> And the <PB N="283" REF="312"/>
Agreement is witnessed, amongst others, by <HI>Edward Rigby,</HI> Gent.
who is expressed in the next Page to be a Receiver for the Earl of
<HI>Derby</HI> in the southern Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and whose
Receipts we have here audited in the 28th of the said Queen's Reign; at the
End of which Account is mention∣ed the Sale of the abovesaid Woods in this
last mention'd Year, for upwards of 1200 <HI>l.</HI> Then follows a short
Bill of some yearly Payments. The next Paper is called <HI>a Note what
Lybertie Mr.</HI> Butler <HI>of</HI> Bewsey <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> had by
Vertue of the Conveyance passed between the Earl of</HI> Leycester
<HI>and him, to lymmit and appointe to his Wieffe or Wyves.</HI> The next is
entitled, <HI>Rygate in Com.</HI> Surrey; and contains the Particulars of three
Woods, that is, <HI>Erle</HI>'s Wood, described to be well set with great
Oaks and Beeches, containing 240 Acres, valued at 3000 <HI>l. Petrydge</HI>
Wood, containing 30 Acres, valued at 207 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4
<HI>d.</HI> and <HI>Raye</HI> Wood, con∣taining 16 Acres, valued at 50
<HI>l.</HI> The next Memorial seems to be a very curious and particular
Account of <HI>the whole yearly Revenue of the Kingdom of</HI> Spain: First,
be∣ginning with the Revenues of all the <HI>States</HI> belonging to that
Crown: The Mines; Customs of them, and of the <HI>Slaves</HI>; amounting to
above ten Millions, four Hundred Thousand Duckets. Next, of the King's yearly
Pension from the five Orders of <HI>Knighthood,</HI> and his Profits upon
bestowing the <HI>Encomendas</HI> belonging to three of them; with the
particular Names, Number, and Value thereof; where it appears, the whole Order
of St. <HI>James</HI> amounts to 385915 Duckets: The whole Order of
<HI>Calatrava</HI> to 254450 Duckets, including that of <HI>Monteza</HI>: The
whole Order of <HI>Alcantara</HI> to 171300 Duckets: Besides the Or∣der of
St. <HI>John,</HI> at this time divided between Don <HI>Antonio de Toledo,</HI>
and the base Son of the Duke of <HI>Alva.</HI> Fur∣ther, that out of the
Rents of the three Orders of <HI>Encomen∣das</HI> that King receives, as Great
Master, for his Part year∣ly, two Hundred and seventy Thousand Duckets.
Then follows an Account of the yearly Charges which that King is at, amounting
to above seven Millions of Duckets; which compared with his Receipts leaves
him above two Millions eight hundred Thousand clear.</P>
<P>Next, we come to a few Papers of more private or par∣ticular
Concern again, as a <HI>Remonsrance to the Lord Chan∣celler</HI> Hatton,
<HI>and Lord Treasurer</HI> Burghley, with the rest of the Council
assembled in the Court of Star-Chamber, against <HI>John Crapnell,</HI>
who was to have a Cause heard in this <PB N="284" REF="313"/> Court; being a
violent Invective against him; persuading, that he is, and has been, a
Rogue in all manner of Lights or Practices: But we here want the Conclusion
of it. After this we have an <HI>Estimate of the Livings of</HI> John
Salusburie of Lleweny, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> in Possession and
Reversion. And the next is a very odd Story; entitled, <HI>The Confession
of</HI> Edw. Burnell: 'Tis comprised in six Pages, and the Substance of
it is this; This Mr. <HI>Burnell,</HI> as appears by his own Com∣plaint, had
met with hard Usage in the <HI>Court of Wards and Liveries</HI>; was turn'd
out of some Possessions; and had brought his Adversaries into the
<HI>Star-Chamber</HI> for Perjury and Forgery: But here, the Equity of his
Cause not being heard; he thought he had a right to say, her Majesty
want∣ed <HI>faithful Hearts,</HI> to see, according to her Disposition,
Justice executed. Hereupon he prepares a <HI>New-Year's Gift</HI> for her
Majesty, which was a <HI>Latin</HI> Oration; but he was taken up and examined
before Sir <HI>George Carey</HI> and <HI>Ralph Lane</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the
very Day, yet so early as two o'clock in the Morning, that he was to have
made his said Speech, which was <HI>January</HI> 1, 1586. This Examination we
have here, with that also of Mr. <HI>Burnell</HI>'s Servant, <HI>John
Cart∣wright;</HI> and therein it appears, when they demanded what his
<HI>New-Yea's Gift</HI> was to be, he answer'd, he had it about him; so
opening his Doublet, he shewed his naked Breast, and said, that after
declaring to her Majesty his good Mean∣ing towards her by the Oration he had
made in <HI>Latin,</HI> he would have ripped his Body as far as he cou'd, and
his Breast, so far as he might, without Danger of Death, to have shewn
her Majesty his Heart. They demanded, whom he acquainted with this Device? He
answered; he had advised with <HI>Paul Warren</HI> and one <HI>Gyles,</HI>
two Surgeons; had asked them, whether a Man being ripped down the Body might
not yet live? They answer'd, hardly; but upon his impor∣tuning
<HI>Warren,</HI> who was his Relation, he promised, if he continued
resolute, that he wou'd meet him at <HI>Greenwich</HI> (where the Court lay)
this Morning. Being required to set down the Oration he meant to have
pronounced; also to give them an Account of what Places and Company he had
been in for eight Days before: He answered, by writing the said Oration
down, which we have here, in half a Page; with the Causes that moved him to
give this Gift; also the Particulars where, and with whom he had been,
since <HI>Christmas</HI> Day last. And thus much for Mr.
<HI>Burnell</HI>'s <HI>New-Year's Gift.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="314"/>This is followed with a Note of the
<HI>Mannor of Wyming∣ton in Com. Bedford,</HI> the Rents and Parcels thereof,
as they have been letten before the Lease made to Mr. <HI>Edw. On∣ley</HI> by
the Earl of <HI>Derby.</HI> A like Note we have here also of <HI>Prescot
Rectory,</HI> both as to the old Rents, and an Esti∣mate of the thirteen
several Tithes demised thereunto: Where it appears that the Sum total of
the Value was then, in <HI>January</HI> 1586, near 500 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI>
The next Piece is entitled, <HI>The Manner of the Execution of the Queen
of</HI> Scotts, <HI>the</HI> 8 <HI>of</HI> Feb. <HI>in the Presence of such
whose Names are underwritten.</HI> This takes up two Sides, and leads us in
the next Leaf to the <HI>Accounts of Sir</HI> Richard Shirburne, of Moneys
receiv'd and paid by Warrant from the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> to <HI>Henry
Stanley</HI> of <HI>Crosshall</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Muster-Master, for
buying Arms for the train'd Soldiers in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and repairing of
Beacons there. The next is entitled, <HI>Fees al∣lowed yearly to the Earl
of</HI> Derby, as Forrester of <HI>Bleas∣dall,</HI> &amp;c. Another of
<HI>Moneys received by Sir</HI> John Byron, and paid to <HI>Henry Stanley</HI>
and others, as before, by the Earl of <HI>Derby's</HI> Warrant. A Note of
<HI>the Number of Loads of Hay</HI> gotten to <HI>Lathome</HI> this Year, 1589;
which were 228 Loads. The next is <HI>a Letter from the</HI> English
<HI>Ambassador at</HI> Paris <HI>to a Privy Counsellor,</HI> commending
the good Offices and Qualities of his Nephew there; and informing him that the
King will receive the <HI>Order</HI> on <HI>Thursday</HI> next, with as great
Honour and show of Good-will as is possible. The next Leaf contains
<HI>an approved Medicine for the Stone</HI>; which is, in a Gallon of new Milk,
to steep, Pellitory of the Wall, wild Thyme, Saxifrage, Parsly, each a
handful, with two or three Radish Roots sliced, one Night; then distill
it all over a moderate Fire: So drink, six Spoonfuls of the Water, with as
many of Rhenish Wine, adding a little Sugar and Nutmeg, lukewarm, fasting;
and eat no∣thing three Hours after: It should be drank, the first Week,
three times together, and every Week after, but twice; for it forceth very much
Urine. If no great Pain is felt in the Kidneys, 'tis better to drink it but
once every eight Days three Mornings together. Next, after a Note of the
<HI>Bedding in the Lodge at</HI> Pilkinton (a Seat of the Lord
<HI>Der∣by</HI>'s aforesaid) we have Copies of two Letters in
<HI>French</HI>; the one called, <HI>Responce de la Royne a la Harangue de
Mon∣sieur de Bellieure Ambassadeur pour le Roy de France touch∣ant le
Pardonne ensemble la Liberte de la Royne D' Escosse</HI>; and the
other, <HI>Coppie de la Lettre de la Royne de Navarre.</HI> 
<PB N="286" REF="315"/> Neither of which need be further here particulariz'd,
the Translations of both into <HI>English</HI> being transcrib'd at the
beginning of this Volumne, as we have before observed. The next is a
<HI>Latin</HI> Letter, dated from <HI>Rome</HI> 10 <HI>May,</HI> 1586.
beginning with an Exclamation against Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> as a Pirate:
And next to this, is inserted a <HI>Latin Pro∣phesy now apply'd to Sir</HI>
Francis Drake, speaking no less in his Commendation, and subscribed
<HI>Merlin</HI>; and in the same Page we have a Rehearsal of Sir <HI>Walter
Ralegh</HI>'s five Pre∣ferments (in the Year last mention'd, or that
following) the Words whereof are these: 1st. That he is appointed
<HI>Lieutenant General</HI> of all <HI>Cornwall.</HI> 2d, To be <HI>Deputy
Lieutenant,</HI> under the Lord <HI>Bath,</HI> of all <HI>Devonshire.</HI>
3d, To be <HI>Marshal</HI> of all the Forces raised in five whole Shires.
4th, To have the <HI>Charge</HI> of twelve hundred Men. 5th, and lastly, is
made <HI>Warden</HI> of the Stanneries. In the next Leaf we have an
<HI>English</HI> Sonnet of six Stanzas, and for Sir <HI>Walter
Ralegh</HI>'s being the Author of it, we are referr'd to good Authority, by a
marginal Note, in the Leaf where it is written. There are three or four little
Memorials more in the Volume, of which we need only mention, first, a
<HI>List of New-Year's Gifts,</HI> beginning with <HI>my Cousin</HI>
Ka∣therine Howard's New-Year's Gift, a Pillow-bear, wrought with black Silk,
and a Sweet-bag: In reward to the Man that brought it, twenty Shillings. And
ending with these; <HI>my Lord of</HI> Leycester<HI>'s New-Year's
Gift,</HI> a Garter, set with Diamonds and Rubies; and all the Letters
curiously ena∣mell'd, in form of Pictures: In reward to Mr. <HI>Arderne,</HI>
who brought it, three Pounds. <HI>My Lord</HI> Admiral<HI>'s New-Year's
Gift,</HI> a Ring set with five fair Opals: Reward men∣tion'd, but not
particulariz'd. And lastly, another <HI>List of the twelve Counsellors of
State in</HI> Ireland.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As this Miscellany contains
some Particulars relating to <HI>Cheshire,</HI> we cannot take our Leave of
it, without being re∣minded thereby, to acknowledge ourselves, for this
Liberty of imparting it's Contents to the Publick, obliged to a Gen∣tleman of
an antient and honourable Family in that County, <HI>Nathaniel Booth</HI>

Communications of other curious Memorials, also, partly, re∣lating to the
Antiquities of the said County, we cannot forbear mentioning one Letter
concerning the said Family, which was written on the Day that King

<BIBL><HI>The</HI> DESCRIPTION <HI>of</HI> LEICESTERSHIRE:
<HI>Containing, Matters of</HI> Antiquity, History, Armory, <HI>and</HI>
Genea∣logy. <HI>Written by</HI> WILLIAM BURTON <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> Fol.
1622. Pages 320.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Title</HI> of this approved Work, is in a graved
Frontispiece, which contains Emblematical Representations (as was usual
in these Times) of <HI>Fame</HI> crowning the Pour∣trait of
<HI>Leicestershire,</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> crowning that of Antiquity;
with the <HI>Sun,</HI> in a Compartment between them, in E∣clipse, and this
Motto, <HI>Relucera</HI>; over a Cave, the En∣trance of which is cover'd with a
Curtain, upon which the said <HI>Title</HI> is inscribed; and at the Bottom
a Prospect of our Author's Seat, named <HI>Lindley.</HI> In another Leaf,
facing that Frontispiece, we have the Author's Effigies in his Lawyer's Gown;

bottom, the <HI>Sun,</HI> with this Motto, <HI>Relumbre:</HI> Both graved by
<HI>Francisco Delaram.</HI></P>
<P>He dedicates the Book to <HI>George Villers,</HI> Marquesse
and Earl of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> Lord High Admiral, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He being a
Native of that County, and none having the like Power to defend his Work
against the Adversaries of Truth. In the Preface he apologizes for applying
himself to Studies beside his Profession, by intimating that if the Law
ad∣mitted <PB N="288" REF="317"/> any Partner, the most necessary would be
this Study of Antiquities: And that his Constitution being weak, it
disabled him from following the Practice which his Calling required; which
obliging him to the Retirement of a Coun∣try Life, and depriving him of those
Helps the City wou'd have afforded, must render his Discourse less
equal to the Worthiness of the Subject; yet rather than his Country should
longer lie obscur'd in Darkness, he adventures to restore her to her
Worth and Dignity, animated by the Ex∣amples of the never enough admir'd
Antiquary <HI>W. Camden,</HI> and that industrious and well deserving
Master <HI>John Speede,</HI> who in his elaborate History of
<HI>England</HI> has well spoken of all the Shires, and by his great Travail
and Expences ad∣ded the Maps of each Shire, with the Plot of every City and
great Town therein inserted, never before performed by any: Also by the
grave and sage Lawyer <HI>W. Lambert,</HI> who from the Depth of Antiquity
has restored the County of <HI>Kent.</HI> Also the eloquent and noble
Gentleman <HI>Richard Carew</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who very worthily has
surveyed all <HI>Cornwall</HI>; and that excellent Surveyor <HI>John
Norden</HI> Gentleman, who has briefly described the Counties of
<HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>Hertford∣shire</HI>; and since has made
certain chorographical Tables of some Western Shires, and a fine
Prospective of the City of <HI>London.</HI> He also acknowledges the
Encouragments he had from some of his Friends, as <HI>John Beaumont</HI> of
<HI>Grace∣dieu</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and that expert Genealogist, his
Kinsman, Mr. <HI>Augustine Vincent, Rouge-Croix,</HI> who imparted many
worthy Notes to him from the Tower; and whose Labours in this kind for the
County of <HI>Northampton,</HI> wou'd ere long come to light. Further, that in
this Description he has run through, in every Town, those four Sections
above men∣tion'd in the Title-Page. As for the <HI>Topography</HI> of the
County, he rectified some Years past <HI>Christ. Saxton's</HI> Map
thereof, with an addition of 80 Towns; which was graved at
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> by <HI>Jodocus Hondius,</HI> 1602, (and since imi∣tated
by <HI>Speede,</HI> with an Augmentation of the Plot of <HI>Leicester</HI>)
and reduced into a lesser Form, is here inserted. Of the more eminent
<HI>Places</HI> he has spoken something throughout; and where any
<HI>natural</HI> Passage offer'd, he has not thought it impertinent to
satisfy the Reader a little in this kind; also adorn'd it with some
historical Digressions, which have dependance upon the Work; has
observ'd, as near as he cou'd, when Monasteries, Churches, noble Seats, and
other <HI>memorable Buildings</HI> were founded; also distin∣guished 
<PB N="289" REF="318"/> the <HI>Descent</HI> of <HI>Titles</HI> to
<HI>Lands,</HI> whether by Heirs or Grants; that the Antiquity of Continuance
in a Name might be discover'd, and the antient Owner known; not intend∣ing to
derogate from any Man's Right, or move Doubts or Questions thereunto. But in
setting down of <HI>Tenures</HI> he has been very sparing: The
<HI>Soccage</HI> Tenure he has express'd; but no Certainty of any other,
unwilling to give any Cause of Offence, as knowing there are more Differences
and strange Proceedings in these Businesses than in any one Thing of
so common a Nature; tho' they might be rec∣tified if the truest and most
probable Records and Evidences were accepted. As for the <HI>Law Cases</HI>
which have latterly happen'd in the Shire, he has briefly remember'd them.
Touching the <HI>Genealogies</HI> and <HI>Arms</HI> of the Gentry he only
speaks of the Ancient, whose Families are extinct, lest not contenting
the Living, he should be question'd without Cause; yet has in this
respect remember'd some few of his Friends. In Church-Matters he has
follow'd an old Ma∣nuscript, compil'd <HI>Anno.</HI> 1220,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a Transcript of it above 300 Years old in the
<HI>Cotton Library.</HI></NOTE> wherein is discover'd what Churches were
Rectories, what, Appropriate: If Rec∣tories, who was Patron, who Incumbent;
what Chapels belong'd to them, and how to be served: If Appropriate, to what
Monastery, or religious House belonging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Has further added
from the Records in the Office of the Auditors of the Imprest, their Value in
the King's Books; and shewn, who are the present Patrons of every Church.
The <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities and others he has briefly touch'd as far as came
to his Knowledge. And lastly, has added all the <HI>Arms</HI> in all the
<HI>Church-Windows</HI> in the Shire; and the <HI>Inscriptions</HI> of the
<HI>Tombs</HI>; which he took by his own View and Travel; for that they may
correct many Errors in Armory or Genealogy, and end many Differences in Law;
the Evidence of a Church-Window having been ac∣cepted by a Jury at an
Assizes. Has also added the Names to most of the Coats; not following
herein the conceited Blazonry of <HI>Gerard Leigh,</HI> or others of later
Times; but used such Terms as himself was best acquainted with, and
might best serve for any one's understanding. Thus we have the whole
Scope of his Intention, or a general View of the Topicks, not only treated of
in this Book, but to be treated of in Books of the like nature.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="319"/>After the Preface, whereof we have here
given the Sub∣stance, we have <HI>Saxton</HI>'s Map, therein spoken of,
graved by <HI>William Kip.</HI> Then we enter upon a general Description of
the County, wherein 'tis observed, from <HI>Mercator,</HI> to be in the
Latitude of 54 Degrees, and in the Longitude of 20. It borders, on the East,
upon <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> and <HI>Rutlandsire</HI>; on the West, upon
<HI>Warwickshire,</HI> separated from it by the great Road called
<HI>Watling-Street</HI>; on the North upon <HI>Nottinghamshire</HI> and
<HI>Derbyshire</HI>; and on the South, upon <HI>Northamptonshire.</HI> It
extends in length from the farthest North Angle in the Vale of
<HI>Belvoir</HI> to the ut∣termost South Point beyond <HI>Lutterworth,</HI>
to about 33 Miles, and in breadth, from East to West, at the broadest
Place, about 27 Miles. Next we come to the scite and nature of the Soil; the
Names of ancient Buildings, as Cas∣tles, Abbeys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Market-Towns, Rivers, Parks, Forrests, Civil and Ecclesiastical
Government; and hence we are led to a particular Discription of the County,
descoursing of all the <HI>Towns,</HI> &amp;c. in an Alphabetical Order. In
the Entrance of the Work we have some occasional Remarks upon the Antiquity
of bearing <HI>Arms</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the mean∣ing of
<HI>Knights-Service, old Tenures</HI> and <HI>Escuage.</HI> In the Mannor of
<HI>Allexton,</HI> we have a little Pedigree of the ancient Lords thereof, the
<HI>Bakepuiz,</HI> with an Account how it came to Sir <HI>Walter Blunt</HI> and
his Widow by purchase. In the Mannor of <HI>Appleby,</HI> we have Accounts of

<HI>Bardon</HI> Park we have a Description of <HI>Bardon</HI> Hill, with a
little Digression upon the natural Cause of Hills and burning Hills, and
the Au∣thors who have writ upon that Subject, as <HI>G. Agricola, Leand.
Alberto, Conrade Gesner,</HI> &amp;c. In the Mannor of <HI>Barrow,</HI> we
have the Arms and Pedigree of the ancient Families of <HI>Somery</HI> and
<HI>Erdington.</HI> In <HI>Barwell,</HI> we have an Explanation of
<HI>Tenants</HI> in <HI>ancient Demesne,</HI> and their <PB N="291" REF="320"/> Privileges. In <HI>Beaumannor,</HI> we have the Arms and Pe∣digree
of the Lord Viscounts <HI>Beaumont,</HI> down to <HI>William</HI> Viscount
<HI>Beaumont,</HI> Lord <HI>Bardolf.</HI> In <HI>Belgrave,</HI> he takes
occasion to shew us how ungratefully <HI>John Bale</HI> has treated
<HI>Leland</HI>'s Book, <HI>de Scriptoribus illustribus Angliae.</HI> Also
ob∣serves, that thro' the Liberty granted to <HI>Leland</HI> of using what
Manuscripts he pleased in any of the religious Houses, he collected many
Things together in divers Books, 
<Q REND="inline">"four Volumes of which I have in my Custody,
says he, and must truly acknowledge them to have afforded me many worthy
Notes of Antiquity."</Q> Here we have also the Arms and Pedigree of the
<HI>Belgraves.</HI> In <HI>Bittesby,</HI> we have an Account of the Marriage

of <HI>Bosworth-Field,</HI> and Slaughter of King <HI>Richard</HI> III. with

we have an Account of the Body of <HI>Thomas Gray</HI> Marquesse of
<HI>Dorset,</HI> removed out of his Vault at <HI>Astley</HI> in
<HI>Warwickshire</HI> in 1608, being 78 Years after he was buried, and it was
uncorrupted, in every respect, like an ordinary Corps newly to be in∣terr'd:
With a short Digression upon the Care all Ages have had to the
preserving of dead Bodies; and a Reference to those Authors who have
written on the Manners and Fa∣shions of Funerals. In <HI>Brokesby,</HI> we
have the Praise, Arms and Pedigree of <HI>George Villiers</HI> Marquesse
of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> In <HI>Brougton Astley,</HI> we have the Arms and
Genealogy of the <HI>Astleys.</HI> In <HI>Burton-Lazers</HI> and the large
Hospital for le∣prous People formerly there, we have a short Digression
upon the Leprosy. In <HI>Burton-Noverey,</HI> we have the Arms and Pedigree
of <HI>Meignell,</HI> in whom that Mannor continued for three Descents, then
came to the <HI>Fitzherberts.</HI> In <HI>Carleton-Curley,</HI> it is
observ'd the Natives have a harsh and rattling kind of Speech, uttering
their Words with much Difficulty, and wharling in the Throat, and cannot well
pronounce the Letter R. which whether it be by some pe∣culiar Property of the
<HI>Water, Soil</HI> or <HI>Air,</HI> or some secret Effect or Operation of
Nature, our Author thinks he can∣not well discover; yet he hereupon takes
occasion to digress upon some remarkable Effects of those Elements. In
<HI>Charnwood,</HI> we have a particular Discourse of the Forrest; the
Deed for disafforresting it; the Distinctions between a Chase and a
Forrest, and the Forrest Laws referr'd to, in <PB N="292" REF="321"/> Mr.
<HI>Manwood</HI>'s learned Treatise thereof. In <HI>Cleybroke,</HI> we have
an Account of some <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities and Coins found hereabouts,
which might give some light of the ancient <HI>Roman</HI> City which once
stood near that Town: Two of these Coins we have here describ'd, one of
the Emperor <HI>Caligula,</HI> the other of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great;
and then, as his Custom is, a Reference to those Authors who have written
of these Coins or given Sculptures of them; And also to those who have
written of <HI>Roman</HI> Inscriptions. In <HI>Cotes,</HI> the Inheritance of
Sir <HI>Henry Skipwith,</HI> we have a Commendation of his Father Sir
<HI>William Skipwith,</HI> among other Proofs of his Learning and Ingenuity,
for his acute Epigrams, Mottos, Devices, but chiefly his apt and fit
<HI>Impresses</HI>; with the Recital of several Authors Names who have
written on this Subject. In <HI>Croxton,</HI> a short Ac∣count of the Death
of King <HI>John,</HI> by reason of the Abbot of the Monastery there,
embalming his dead Body. In <HI>Dadlington,</HI> we see the Conveyance of
that Mannor to our Author. In <HI>Dalby Magna,</HI> the Descent of the Lords
<HI>de Segrave.</HI> In <HI>Dalby</HI> on the Woulds, a little History of
that famous religious Order, the Knights <HI>Hospitaliers</HI> of St.
<HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which began about 1124, after the
recovery of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> by <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bullen.</HI> Here,
in the Account of the Conveyance of this Mannor from Sir <HI>Andrew Noel,</HI>
our Author takes occasion to speak of his Brother Mr. <HI>Henry Noel</HI>
Gentleman-Pensioner to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who, tho' he had nothing but
his Pension cer∣tain, equall'd the Barons in Pomp and Expence; and of whom
the said Queen made this Aenigmatical Distich. 
<Q> 
<L>The Word of <HI>Denial,</HI> and Letter of <HI>Fifty,</HI></L>

<L>Is the Gentleman's Name, who will never be
thrifty.</L></Q></P>

in the Church at the Funeral of a Knight. In <HI>Elmesthorp,</HI> the
Pedigree of the <HI>Charnels</HI> and <HI>Trussels.</HI> In

<HI>Jodocus Hondius</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> In <HI>Foston,</HI> a
Hi∣story of the Family of the <HI>Faunts,</HI> particularly <HI>Arthur
Faunt</HI> the Jesuit, who died 1551; also their Pedigree. In
<HI>Foles∣worth,</HI> that of the <HI>Wolfes.</HI> In <HI>Gerendon,</HI> the
Antiquity of the <HI>Cistercian</HI> Order. In <HI>Gracedieu,</HI> we have
the Arms and Pedigree of the <HI>Beaumonts;</HI> and in <HI>Groby</HI> the like
of the <HI>Greys</HI> of <HI>Groby.</HI> In <HI>Higham,</HI> an Account of
certain old Coins and other Treasure found <HI>Anno</HI> 1607, many whereof
were little silver Pieces of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. each weighing three
pence, representing on one Side the King's Head with a Scepter in his Hand,
circumscribed <HI>Henricus Rex</HI>; on the Reverse, a <HI>Cross Molin
between Roundels,</HI> with this Circum∣scription, <HI>Fulke on Luid:</HI>
Also some Gold Rings, and a Silver one with a ruddy Stone in it, whereon
was engraved <HI>Arabick</HI> Characters, importing a kind of Charm or
Depre∣cation from Mischief; with our Author's Reasons why they shou'd be
some Jew's Treasure. In <HI>Houghton,</HI> we have an Explanation of the
Words <HI>Villein</HI> and <HI>Villenage,</HI> with <HI>Bre∣ton's</HI> Opinion
of their Antiquity, and our Author's Obser∣vation that many <HI>great
Houses</HI> now are, whose lineal An∣cestors were <HI>Villeins;</HI> who
by their Surnames might easily be challenged, but that he lists not to lay
any Imputation. In <HI>Humberston,</HI> we have the Arms and Pedigree of the
<HI>Kebles</HI>; and in <HI>Huncote</HI> of the <HI>Burdets</HI> and the
<HI>Staffords.</HI> In <HI>Keythorp</HI> and <HI>Kettleby,</HI> some Account
of the <HI>Digbys.</HI> In <HI>Kibworth-Beauchamp,</HI> an Explanation of

<HI>Curtesy of</HI> England. In <HI>Langley,</HI> some Observations of
the Virgin Chastity affirm∣ed to be visible in the shining Brightness
of some holy Wo∣men's Faces. In <HI>West Langton,</HI> a short Account of
<HI>Walter de Langton</HI> Bishop of <HI>Coventry</HI> and
<HI>Litchfield,</HI> a great Bene∣factor in his Time, who died 1321. In
<HI>Leicester,</HI> he shews that it was called <HI>Caër-Lerion,</HI>
from it's standing on the River of <HI>Legra</HI> or <HI>Leir</HI> now called
<HI>Sore</HI> according to <HI>Le∣land,</HI> and not from the fabulous King
<HI>Leir,</HI> whom <HI>Geoffrey</HI> <PB N="294" REF="323"/> of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> wou'd have the Builder, and also Founder of the Temple of
<HI>Janus</HI> which was here; it being well known that <HI>Janus</HI> was
neither adored nor thought of by any but the <HI>Romans,</HI> and this King
<HI>Leir</HI> died at least 300 Years before <HI>Rome</HI> was built; which,
with many other such Con∣tradictions, will easily convince this forged
History of <HI>Brute,</HI> and of his Progeny. Then follows an Account of
some <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities found in this City, when it was made first
an Episcopal See, and when united to <HI>Lincoln.</HI> A short View of the
ancient State of this City; the Foundation of a College there, and the Abbey,
and of some famous Men who were Abbots thereof, as <HI>Gilbert
Foliot</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He is not reckon'd in the Catalogue of
Abbots in <HI>Bibl. Cotton. Vitell. F.</HI> 17. <HI>Fol.</HI> 38. but he was
Abbot of <HI>Gloucester. Vide Annal. Winton. et Annul. Wigorn. in Anglia

de Knighton</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nor is he reckon'd among them,
in that Catalogue in the <HI>Cotton Library.</HI></NOTE>, before mention'd, and
<HI>Philip Ripington</HI> a great Defender of <HI>Wick∣liffe</HI>; others who
were Archdeacons of <HI>Leicester,</HI> as <HI>Robert Grosthead</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> 1235, who wrote near 200 Books, and translated
out of <HI>Greek</HI> in 1242 the <HI>Testament of the twelve Patriarchs,</HI>
which, as <HI>Nich. Trivet,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> Abbot of
<HI>Peterborough</HI> say, was long withheld from the Christians by the
Malice of the Jews: He died at <HI>Bugden</HI> 1253, and had a marble Tomb with
his Image in Brass on it. See more of him in <HI>Leland, Bale</HI> and
<HI>Godwin.</HI> Further, also, of some eminent Persons born here, and
some who also died here, as Cardinal <HI>Wolsey. Matthew Paris</HI> his
Story of the religious Maid, who died here in 1225, after having been shut up
seven Years and tasted no kind of Sustenance but the Sacrament of Bread
and Wine upon the Sabbath Days; refuted by <HI>John Wier</HI> in his Book
<HI>de Commentitiis Jejuniis.</HI> Also of some ancient Buildings here; the
Market and Fair; Patronage of the Churches, Arms in the Windows, Valuations of
the Livings; with the Arms and Pedigrees of the Earls of <HI>Leicester</HI>
from Earl <HI>Leofric, Anno.</HI> 716, down to <HI>Robert Sidney</HI>
Viscount <HI>Lisle,</HI> Son of Sir <HI>Henry Sidney;</HI> who was created
Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> by King <HI>James</HI> I. Of <HI>Lindley,</HI> we
have, as might be expected, a particular Account, where it appears, how a third
Part of that Lordship descended to one of our Author's Ancestors, by
marriage with the Daughter and Coheir of <HI>John Herd∣wik,</HI> Guide to King
<HI>Henry</HI> VII. at <HI>Bosworth-Field,</HI> and by <PB N="295" REF="324"/>
that means to our Author himself, who assures us it has been observed
in this Lordship, that thereon was never seen Adder, Snake, or Lizard, tho'
in all the bordering Confines they have been found very often. And here follow
the Arms and Pedigrees of the <HI>Herdwiks</HI> and of the <HI>Burtons.</HI> In
<HI>Loughborough,</HI> we have some Account of the Family of the
<HI>Hastings,</HI> to one of whom this Mannor was given; another, who was
<HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Hastings,</HI> Chamberlain to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI>
our Author observes to have been of a Disposition somewhat melancholy,
and was much delighted with Chesse Play, upon which Game our Author makes
some short historical Digressions, ending with a Note of those
Authors who have written thereupon; with other Games which have been invented
in imitation thereof, among which he mentions <HI>Metromachia</HI> or <HI>Ludus
Geometricus,</HI> made by Dr. <HI>Fulk</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and printed
in <HI>London</HI> 1566. In <HI>Lubbenham,</HI> we have some Remarks upon the

<HI>Lutterworth,</HI> a short Account of <HI>John Wickliffe,</HI> who wrote
above 200 Treatises, many of them against the Pope's Authority, and
Abuses in the Church: Most of them were burnt in <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> by
<HI>Subincus</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Prague,</HI> as <HI>Aeneas Sylvius</HI>
writes; and for which, the Author was put to great Trou∣ble in his Life-time,
tho' much favour'd by King <HI>Edward</HI> III. and his Son <HI>John</HI> of
<HI>Gaunt.</HI> He died 1384, and Dr. <HI>Thomas Gascoigne</HI> has written
some Particulars of the Man∣ner of his Death, preserv'd by <HI>Leland</HI>
in his <HI>Collectanea.</HI> Forty one Years after his Death, his Corps, after
Excom∣munication by Archbishop <HI>Arundell,</HI> was by the Command of Pope
<HI>Martin</HI> V. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> burnt by <HI>Richard Fleming</HI> Bishop
of <HI>Lincoln.</HI> In <HI>Misterton,</HI> we have an Account of Sir
<HI>John Poultney,</HI> four times Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and a great

<HI>Saladine,</HI> up∣on Occasion of Sir W. <HI>Burdet</HI>'s spending
several Years in those Wars. Here is also mention'd, among others of this
Family, that <HI>Thomas Burdet,</HI> who, upon hearing that King 
<PB N="296" REF="325"/> <HI>Edward</HI> the IV had killed a favourite white Buck
in his Park, at <HI>Arrow</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> having wish'd the
Buck's Head and Horns in his Belly, who moved the King to kill it, was
accused of Treason and beheaded, 1477; but the true Cause was his being a
Friend and Counsellor to <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> his
Brother, between whom there had been great Enmity. And here follow the Arms and
Genealogy of the <HI>Burdets, Camviles, Marmions,</HI> and <HI>Bruyns.</HI> In
<HI>Nor∣manton Turvile,</HI> the Arms and Pedigree of the <HI>Turviles.</HI> In

other Church Monuments those of the <HI>Haselrigs,</HI> with their Arms and
Pedigree. In <HI>Orton,</HI> there is a Contest decided in Law about the
Presentment made to this Vicarage. In <HI>Coal-Orton,</HI> so call'd of the
Coal-Mines which are there, we have an Observation that these Mines burnt
for many Years to∣gether unquenchably in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII,
as in <HI>Staffordshire</HI> they did at this time of our Author's writing;
Whence we have a Digression upon the subterraneous Fires in <HI>Italy,
Sicily, Mount Heklia, Mons Cruris, Terra del Fue∣go,</HI> &amp;c. Here we have
the Arms and Genealogy of the <HI>Beaumonts,</HI> and in <HI>Osbaston</HI> of
the <HI>Wichards, Suttons</HI> and <HI>Blunts.</HI> In <HI>Pekleton,</HI> upon
a certain Occasion of the vexa∣tious Differences which happen'd between the
Issue of a first and second Wife, we have some Reflections on the

Pedigree of the ancient Family of the <HI>Mutons,</HI> and of the
<HI>Vincents.</HI> In <HI>Prestwould,</HI> the Arms and Pedigree of the

<HI>Raunston,</HI> upon observing this Mannor, tho'encompassed with
<HI>Leicestershire,</HI> is part in the County of <HI>Derby,</HI> we have
some Conjectures upon such Distinctions and other Divisions of the
Land, particularly the Antiquity of dividing it into Shires in the
<HI>Britons</HI> time, about the time of King <HI>Arthur</HI>; and that King
<HI>Alfred</HI> was a Reformer of that Division. In <HI>Rodely,</HI> some
Account of the Order of the <HI>Knights Templars,</HI> which began 1113; of
their Seat and Church in the Temple; their Suppression in 1313; and that
the <HI>Inner Temple</HI> is the Mother or most ancient of all the other
Houses of Court; into which So∣ciety our Author was admitted 1593. Here, upon
men∣tioning one <HI>Parker</HI> a famous Farrier, we have a Digression upon
this Science (relating to Horses) so necessary in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> 
<PB N="297" REF="326"/> as those useful and willing Creatures are more
abused here than in any other Country in the World: Together with a Recital
or Reference to the most eminent Authors who have written upon this Subject.
In <HI>Sapcot,</HI> we are informed what the Qualification or Income of the
ancient <HI>Barony</HI> was, and of how much yearly value the <HI>Knights
Fee</HI> consisted; also how those Baronies were held. And here we have
the Arms and Pedigree of the <HI>Bassets</HI>; as in <HI>Shepey Magna,</HI>
those of the <HI>Shepeys,</HI> and in <HI>Shepey Parva</HI> those of the
<HI>Odingsels:</HI> Here also we have an Account of one <HI>John
Poultney,</HI> who used to walk and do many other Actions in his Sleep; but
was afterwards frozen to death in Sir <HI>Hugh Willoughby</HI>'s Expedition.
Our Author having touched upon the Cause of this Distemper refers to a
<HI>German</HI> Doctor, who has written of the Nature, Causes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of those who <HI>walk in their Sleep.</HI> In
<HI>Skiffington,</HI> some Reflections upon <HI>Jealousy</HI>; on
occasion of a Knight of that Name, who was infected therewith. In
<HI>Sproxton,</HI> Reflections upon <HI>leaving Estates to younger
Brothers;</HI> allowing they should be pro∣vided for, but without Prejudice
to the Dignity of the House and Injury of the Heirs. In <HI>Staunton
Herold,</HI> we have the Arms and Pedigree of the ancient Families of those
Names. In <HI>Stoke,</HI> the Steeple being shaken down by the ge∣neral
<HI>Earthquake</HI> in 1580, we have here a short Digression upon
<HI>Earthquakes,</HI> and the three Sorts of them distinguished; with a
Reference, as our Author's Manner is, to some Wri∣ters on that Subject. In
<HI>Stockerston,</HI> we have an Account of a fictitious Case of
<HI>Perpetuities</HI> argued, and the Judgment thereupon; also the Arms and
Pedigrees of the <HI>Boiviles</HI> and <HI>Southills.</HI> In
<HI>Swannington,</HI> on occasion of mentioning Sir <HI>John Talbot,</HI> who
was of an extraordinary great Stature, and whose Tomb is to be seen at
<HI>Whitwick</HI> near adjoining, we have a short Digression upon
<HI>Giants.</HI> In <HI>Swimford,</HI> the Arms and Pedigrees of the
<HI>Malorys</HI> and the <HI>Vincents</HI>; and in <HI>Temple</HI> of the
<HI>Temples.</HI> In <HI>Thurcaston,</HI> the Arms and Pedi∣gree of the
<HI>Falconers</HI> and <HI>Champaines.</HI> In <HI>Tilton,</HI> we have the
Case of Sir <HI>Everard Digby,</HI> who convey'd this Mannor with other Parts
of his Estate to his Son and Heir in Tail, before he was concern'd in the
Gunpowder Treason, and the Question resolv'd, which after his Execution,
thereup∣on arose, whether the Wardship of the Heir, or the third Part of
the said Estate should be in the King? as recited from the Lord
<HI>Coke</HI>'s <HI>Reports.</HI> In <HI>Twicrosse,</HI> the Arms and
Pedigree of the <HI>Fitzherberts</HI>; and in <HI>Upton,</HI> a short
Ac∣count <PB N="298" REF="327"/> of Sir <HI>Anthony Fitzherbert</HI> the Judge.
In <HI>Wanlip,</HI> the Arms and Pedigree of <HI>Walleis</HI> or
<HI>Welsh</HI>; and in <HI>Welles∣burgh,</HI> those of the Family of that
Name. In <HI>Wikin,</HI> a short Account of <HI>Wightman</HI> the Heretick,
who was burnt at <HI>Litchfield:</HI> Also of other Herericks, as
<HI>Hacket,</HI> &amp;c. In <HI>Willoughby,</HI> an Account of
<HI>Richard,</HI> Son of Sir <HI>Richard de Angervile</HI>; who being born at
<HI>Bury</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and taking upon him religious Orders
forsook his paternal Name, and was called <HI>de Bury,</HI> from the Place of
his Nativity, as ap∣pears in <HI>Jo. Trithem. de Script Eccles.</HI> and
Bishop <HI>Godwin</HI>; but is yet called <HI>de Angervile</HI> by <HI>Rous,
Leland,</HI> and <HI>Bale:</HI> With some Observations upon this Custom;
and further, of this <HI>Richard,</HI> who was Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI>
Lord Chan∣cellor and Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> but most famous
for his Love of <HI>Books,</HI> having more in his own Library than all the
Bishops in <HI>England,</HI> which afterwards he gave to the Library he
founded at <HI>Oxford</HI>; but in the space of an Age it was pillaged of
those excellent Manuscripts, till Duke <HI>Humphrey</HI> repair'd it again:
But in the hot zealous Times of the Reformation this Treasure was also
embezled, till of late, thro' the Bounty of Sir <HI>T. Bodley</HI> and his
Friends the publick Library there was, at the Cost of many thou∣sand
Pounds, restored equal to the best in <HI>Europe.</HI> In
<HI>Wi∣mondham,</HI> we have the Arms and Pedigree of the <HI>Berkeleys.</HI>
In <HI>Woodhouse,</HI> we have an Account of the fair and stately Chapel,
built of <HI>Ashler</HI> Stone 1338, by <HI>Henry</HI> Lord
<HI>Beau∣mont,</HI> and repair'd by <HI>Robert Farnham,</HI> the 28th of
<HI>Henry</HI> VI. as appears by the Deed of Covenant between him and a certain
Free-Mason, for new building the Steeple and re∣pairing the Church: Also a
Blazon of all the Coats and Matches in the Windows there, as is perform'd for
those of the rest of the Churches. After the short mention of a Village
or two more, we come to an end of this alphabe∣tical Account of what is most
observable in the Antiquities of <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> which our
Author winds up with a modest Conclusion. To which is join'd, one Table,
shewing, to what Abbies, Priories, Nunneries, or other religious Houses the
<HI>Churches</HI> in this County were appropriated: Another, of the Names and
Arms of those <HI>Knights of the Garter</HI> which were of this County,
either by Title, Birth, or Dwelling: Another, of the Names and Arms of the
<HI>Knights</HI> in this County who served King <HI>Edward</HI> I. in his
Wars; and ano∣ther, of all those Persons to whom the Counties of
<HI>Leicester</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> were committed, and were
<HI>Sheriffs</HI> thereof: <PB N="299" REF="328"/> And lastly, we have a
short Table or Index of the princi∣pal Matters in the whole Work.</P>
<P>Thus we end our brief Recapitulation of this Book; not without
some wonder to observe, that after near sixscore Years since this
Author thus broke through those Clouds of Darkness and Oblivion, wherewith
the Lustre of this County had been overshadowed, so few others should
see the way to imitate his Example, by their further Illustra∣tions
thereof: Insomuch that we know not of any one County in <HI>England,</HI>
which in that compass of Years has had fewer Publications bestowed upon it
relating either to its <HI>Antiquities,</HI> or <HI>natural History.</HI> Nay
even our Author's own improved Copy of this Work, very much enriched with
<HI>Roman, Saxon,</HI> and other Antiquities, has, to this day, been deny'd the
Light. Wherefore we thought it a Debt due to his Merit, as well as to the
Subject he has celebrated, to take the Notice we have here done of them, in
order to excite those whom it may concern, to oblige the Publick either with
that enlarged Work of this Author, with further Continuations thereof, or any
other such Memorials of the Place and its Products, as may render them, with
what Justice they deserve, no less consi∣derable than other Counties,
and their Productions appear in this Island.</P>

<HEAD>XLVI. 
<BIBL>A RESTITUTION <HI>of decay'd</HI> INTELLIGENCE <HI>in</HI>
ANTIQUI∣TIES, <HI>concerning the most noble and renowned</HI> ENGLISH NATION.
<HI>By the Study and Labour of</HI> R. V. <HI>London.</HI> Quarto, 1634. Pages
338, besides Table, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS approved Book is well known to be the Work of <HI>Richard
Verstegan,</HI> a secular Priest, who has printed his Name at the End of
his Dedication thereof to King <HI>James</HI>; for this is at least the third
Edition, published here at <HI>London</HI> soon after the Author's Death;
the first, which he printed himself at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> being in the Year
1605. The Author was skilful in Drawing and Limning; and has em∣bellish'd his
Work with several Draughts, which are neatly graved, and have not a little
advantaged the Sale of the <PB N="300" REF="329"/> Work; insomuch that there
have since been two Editions more of it in <HI>Octavo,</HI> but the
Impression of the Cuts are therein worn faint, and not so valuable as
those in the first Quarto Editions.</P>
<P>The Author, in his Epistle to the noble and renowned
<HI>English</HI> Nation, among other Motives for his Undertaking, intimates,
his finding our <HI>English</HI> Writers to stand so much upon the
Descent of the <HI>Britains</HI> to be one; as if it con∣cern'd the Original
and Honour of the <HI>English</HI> Nation; whereby and through the want of
due Distinction between the two Nations (an Oversight which the
<HI>Britains</HI> in their Account of us will never commit) our true Original
and honourable Antiquity lie involv'd and obscur'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus
<HI>John Boden</HI> wou'd make us believe, it is in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s
Com∣mentaries to be found, That the <HI>Englishmen</HI> of his Time had but
one Woman to serve for ten or twelve Men: Whereas <HI>Caesar</HI> never
heard the Name of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> who came not into <HI>Britain</HI>
near 500 Years after his Death. And thus, not to let slip the Opportunity of
a Lash at Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> he is censur'd for beginning his <HI>Acts</HI>
and <HI>Monuments,</HI> with saying that <HI>Constantine</HI> was the Son
of <HI>Helen</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Woman: Thus another entitles his
Dictionary, which is in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English, Thesaurus Linguae
Romanae et Britannicae</HI>; which wou'd have been proper enough had it been
written in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Welsh.</HI> Having reflected on the
Confusion which such Indistinctions create, he shews that
<HI>Englishmen</HI> cannot but from the <HI>Saxons</HI> derive their
Descent and Off∣spring, and can lack no Honour in descending from such
an honourable Race, as this Work will specify; which our Au∣thor was induced
to publish for his love to this noble Nation, most dear to him, because
it was his Birth-place, tho' his Grandfather (who was driven into
<HI>England</HI> by Wars and loss of Friends) was born in <HI>Geldres.</HI>
Towards the Conclusion of this Epistle he informs us that if in his
Etymologies he dif∣fers from some <HI>Germans,</HI> 'tis where he has found
them mistaken by having look'd little further than the Language used among
themselves, even like those who have also written in the
<HI>Netherlands;</HI> whereas the understanding of the <HI>Teutonic</HI>
used by our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors, as also that of the ancient
<HI>Franks,</HI> is most requisite; and thereunto the <HI>High, Low,</HI>
and <HI>Easterland Teutonic,</HI> with respect also to the dependant
<HI>Danish</HI> and <HI>Swedish,</HI> besides our modern vul∣gar
<HI>English</HI>: 
<Q REND="inline">"In all which, says he, I have bestowed some
time of Travell; for that hereby, and not otherwise, the 
<PB N="301" REF="330"/> true Reason and Concurrence of Things, properly
apper∣taining to the true Original <HI>Teutonic</HI> Tongue, is best to be
found out, and made manifest."</Q></P>
<P>After several Copies of <HI>Latin</HI> Verses by <HI>Richard
White</HI> of <HI>Basinstoke, Richard Stanihurst</HI> and others, and
some <HI>English</HI> Verses by <HI>Tho. Shelton, Fr. Tregian, A.
Greneway, Ralph Badclyfe,</HI> and the Author himself, we enter upon the
Work, which is divided into <HI>Ten</HI> Chapters. The First is, <HI>Of the
Original of Nations, and consequently that from which</HI> Englishmen
<HI>are descended.</HI> In this Chapter the Author dis∣courses, (after
shewing that the <HI>English</HI> are of <HI>German</HI> De∣scent,
heretofore called <HI>Saxons,</HI> and still in the <HI>British,</HI> as
also the ancient <HI>Irish</HI> Tongue, so called) of the Original of
Nations from the Division, after the Deluge, at the Tower of <HI>Babel</HI>;
and upon the numerous Increase of Posteri∣ty, illustrated in the Example
of the Issue of one Person near our Author's Time, and that was a Woman
named <HI>Yoland Baillie,</HI> who died at <HI>Paris</HI> 1514, aged 88 Years,
and in the eighth Year of her Widowhood; by whose Epitaph in the Church-yard
of St. <HI>Innocents,</HI> it appears there were 295 Children issued from
herself while she lived. Then we have an Account how the People after the
Flood inhabited the Mountains; how <HI>Nimrod</HI> took upon him the first
Go∣vernment. Particulars of the Tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> as to its width and
height, from <HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Isidore.</HI> Of the Con∣fusion of
Tongues; whence the Original of Nations; whence the <HI>Hebrews</HI> were so
called. The Posterity of <HI>Sem, Cham</HI> and <HI>Japhet.</HI> That the
People were not mixed by the Confusion of Tongues. Concerning the Inhabitants
of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> we are referr'd to <HI>Augustine Carate</HI>'s
History of those Parts. How the <HI>Dutch</HI> are descended from
<HI>Tuisco.</HI> Whence some Days of the Week are derived. That the
<HI>Germans</HI> were the first and only Possessors of their Country.
Touching their Name of <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Almans</HI>; with their divers
other Names. A Remark upon <HI>Leland</HI>'s asserting that the
<HI>Cimbri</HI> and <HI>Sicambri</HI> received their Names of <HI>Cambria</HI>
the Daughter of <HI>Belinus</HI> King of <HI>Britain.</HI> Expla∣nations of the
Names of the <HI>Freislanders, Swevians, Goths, Danes, Normans, Vandals,
Longobards,</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> who were so called from the crooked
Weapons they wore like a Scithe, still called in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> a
<HI>Saisen.</HI> The watch Word <HI>Nem eowr Seaxes.</HI> Examples of other
People re∣ceiving their Denomination from their Weapons, as the
<HI>Scythians</HI> from Shooting, the <HI>Galliglasses</HI> from their
<HI>Pole∣axes,</HI> <PB N="302" REF="331"/> as others anciently from the Clothes
and Gowns they wore. And these are the chief Contents of this Chapter.</P>
<P>The second Chapter shews <HI>how the ancient noble</HI>
Saxons, <HI>the true Ancestors of</HI> Englishmen, <HI>were originally a
People of</HI> Germany. And here he asserts, That all our Writers agree the
<HI>Englishmen</HI> came from <HI>Germany.</HI> That all had their Begin∣ning
in <HI>Asia.</HI> That the Affinity between the <HI>German</HI> and
<HI>Per∣sian</HI> Language, affirmed by some, extended not to half a
score Words, as our Author was inform'd from the best Interpre∣ters in the
Train of Sir <HI>Ant. Sherley</HI> and <HI>Cuchin Ollibeag,</HI>
Ambassadors from <HI>Persia,</HI> in <HI>Italy, Anno</HI> 1601. That the
<HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> were by the <HI>Grecians</HI> called
<HI>Celtae,</HI> from their frequent Riding. A Specimen of the
<HI>Persian</HI> Tongue, into which the Beginning of the first Chapter of
<HI>Genesis</HI> is here translated. A fabulous Narration of <HI>Occa
Scarlensis,</HI> concerning <HI>Friso, Saxo,</HI> and <HI>Bruno,</HI> with
a Confutation thereof. That <HI>Brunswick</HI> took its Name of
<HI>Bruno</HI> Son of <HI>Ludolph</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who first
began to build it in the Year 861. This is followed with Arguments to prove
that our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors were originally of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
did not come from other Parts thither; with the Concur∣rence of
<HI>Lipsius.</HI> Observations that no Nations call one ano∣ther, as each
calls himself; and that the <HI>Germans</HI> who were the continu'd
Possessors of <HI>Germany,</HI> were never subdued; also unmixed
both in People and Language. That the <HI>French</HI> issued from the
<HI>Franks</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI>; to whom the ancient <HI>Gauls</HI> gave
place, much about the Time that the <HI>Saxons</HI> came thence into
<HI>Britain.</HI> That the <HI>Longobards</HI> or People of <HI>Lombardy,</HI>
and also the <HI>Normans</HI> issued from the <HI>Germans</HI>; as the
Nobility of <HI>Spain</HI> from the <HI>Goths.</HI> Then we have many ancient
Testimonies of the Worthiness of the <HI>Germans;</HI> with a Description
of the Country, as it was antiently; also the Vertues and Manners of the
Peo∣ple: Arguments and Examples to prove, That it is not the Climate or
Temperature of the <HI>Air</HI> makes the Peo∣ple of any Country more or less
learned or ingenious. A Recital of sundry rare <HI>Inventions,</HI> in Arts
and Sciences, which had their Original in <HI>Germany.</HI> Reflections upon
their national Vice of Drunkenness.</P>
<P>The third Chapter describes <HI>the antient Manner of living
among our</HI> Saxon <HI>Ancestors: The Idols they adored while they were
Pagans; and how they grew to be of greatest Name and Habitation of any other
People in</HI> Germany. Here our <PB N="303" REF="332"/> said Ancestors are
very particularly described, as to their personal Appearance in Attire,
Arms, Exercise, the Orders or Degrees of People among them, their Custom of
<HI>Gavel-kind, Give all kind,</HI> or give each Child his Share; the
nur∣sing of Children by their own Mothers; their counting of Time by the
Nights, as Se'nnights and Fortnights, and the Ages of their own Lives by
Winters. Their Computa∣tation of Time they notched upon square Sticks, called
<HI>Al∣mon-aght,</HI> or <HI>All moon heed,</HI> whence our <HI>Almanac.</HI>
Here we have the old <HI>Saxon</HI> Names of the twelve <HI>Months</HI> in the
Year, with their Explanations; which we now call by Names of <HI>French</HI>
and <HI>Latin</HI> Derivation. Next of the an∣cient Government of
<HI>Saxony</HI>; the four sorts of <HI>Ordeal,</HI> or Trial of Right, by
Combat, hot Iron, hot Water, and cold Water: But, not thought fit to be
continued among Chri∣stians, they were abolish'd by Pope <HI>Stephen.</HI>
Here we enter upon the Idolatry of the Pagan <HI>Saxons,</HI> and their
superstitious Customs for presaging of Events. More particularly of
their Idols for the seven <HI>Days</HI> in the <HI>Week,</HI> which we have
here neatly represented in Sculpture; as first, the Idol of the
<HI>Sun,</HI> whence comes the Name of <HI>Sunday</HI>; next that of the
<HI>Moon,</HI> whence <HI>Monday</HI>; next the Idol of <HI>Thysco,</HI>
whence <HI>Tuesday</HI>; next is their Idol <HI>Woden</HI> or God of Battle,
whence <HI>Wednes∣day</HI>; the next is their Majestic <HI>Thor,</HI>
sitting under a Throne with a Circle of Stars behind his Head, whence
<HI>Thursday</HI>; the next is <HI>Friga,</HI> an Idol that represented
both <HI>Sexes,</HI> with a Sword in one Hand and Bow in the other; was reputed
the Giver of Peace and Plenty, the Causer of Love and Friendship, and from
the Day of her Adoration we yet retain the Name of <HI>Friday.</HI> The last
is the Idol of <HI>Seater,</HI> repre∣sented standing on the sharp-finn'd
back of a Pearch, to sig∣nify, the <HI>Saxons,</HI> for serying him,
should pass without Harm in dangerous Places; also holding a Wheel in his
left Hand, to betoken their Unity and Concurrence in one Course; and a Pail
full of Water, Flowers and Fruits in the right Hand, to denote that with kindly
Rain he wou'd nourish and dispose the Earth to such Productions. After
these, we have an Ac∣count of two other <HI>Saxon</HI> Idols, as that named
<HI>Ermensewl,</HI> or the Pillar of the Poor, which the <HI>Franks,</HI>
with other <HI>Germans,</HI> as well as the <HI>Saxons</HI> ador'd: And that
also named <HI>Flynt,</HI> from the Stone it stood on; besides three or
four more, which are only named. And here we have our Author's Reasons why
the <HI>Romans</HI> mistook the <HI>German</HI> Idols to be derived from
their own, as <HI>Thor</HI> from <HI>Jupiter, Friga</HI> from <HI>Venus,</HI>
and <PB N="304" REF="333"/> <HI>Seater</HI> from <HI>Saturn:</HI> Also his
Remarks on the horrible Excess of Idolatry their Votaries were arrived to, in
that <HI>Harold</HI> I. King of <HI>Norway</HI> sacrificed two of his Sons to
his Idols, that they might grant such a Tempest as would dis∣perse and
confound the Fleet which <HI>Harold</HI> VI. King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was
preparing to send against him. Further, that in <HI>Britain</HI> none of
their Idols were in greater Request than <HI>Woden,</HI> as by several
Places in <HI>Kent, Staffordshire,</HI> and <HI>Wilt∣shire</HI> may appear,
which retain their Appellations from him. But these Idols were all
demolish'd by <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> the first Chri∣stian <HI>English
Saxon</HI> King, and others of those Kings in their several Territories.
Next we are inform'd how the <HI>Saxons</HI> extended their Bounds in
<HI>Germany</HI> beyond any other People there; and how they were transported
by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great into <HI>Transilvania</HI> and other Regions;
which introduces an incredible Story of a <HI>Transportation</HI> which
happen'd in <HI>Saxony</HI> not many Ages past. For there came into the Town
of <HI>Hamel</HI> in <HI>Brunswick</HI> a Man, whom, partly from his patch'd
or motly-colour'd Coat, they called the <HI>Pied-piper,</HI> who having agreed
with them to rid their Town of Rats, wherewith it was much annoyed; he with his
Pipe drew all the said Vermin after him into the River <HI>Weaser,</HI>
where they were drown'd. But the Townsmen then swerving from their
Agreement, the discontented <HI>Piper</HI> gave them another Tune thro' the
Town again, but it was a revengeful one, drawing all the Children therein, to
the Number of 130, after him, till they came to a Hill, which opening on the
side, let them in, <HI>Piper</HI> and all, so closed up again, and they
were never more seen or heard of, to the great Lamentation of the Parents in
that Town. In memory whereof, it was or∣dain'd, that no musical Instrument
should be sounded in the Street which led to the Gate, through which they
pass'd; that no Ostery should be there held; and that in the dating of
all publick Writings, the Year from the going forth of their Children, should
be added to that of our Lord: Which they have accordingly ever since
continued, says our Author. And this great Wonder happen'd the 22d of
<HI>July,</HI> 1376.</P>
<P>Chapter the fourth, <HI>Of the Isle of</HI> Albion,
<HI>afterwards called</HI> Britain, <HI>and now</HI> England, Scotland,
<HI>and</HI> Wales: <HI>And how it shewed to be Continent or firm Land
with</HI> Gallia <HI>or</HI> France, <HI>since</HI> Noah'<HI>s Flood.</HI>
Here having shewn the dif∣ferent Opinions of the Derivation of the Word
<HI>Albion</HI> from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and from the Name
of some chief Governor, he proceeds to display the like variety of
Con∣jectures <PB N="305" REF="334"/> touching the Name of <HI>Britain,</HI> from
Sir <HI>T. Eliot, Humphrey Lhuyd,</HI> and <HI>Becanus,</HI> not withholding
his own Opinion that the Island had the Name of <HI>Britain</HI> from
<HI>Brute</HI>; however many fabulous Circumstances may have been by a few
obscure Authors heretofore added to this History, and so have made the
whole to be doubted of. Next he sets forth the imagin'd Descents from the
<HI>Trojans</HI>; the Cause of which fond Conceits possessing so
many, he attributes to the want of Learning in former Ages, their
<HI>Druids</HI> them∣selves not having any Knowledge of Letters. Our Author
questions not only these Descents from the <HI>Trojans,</HI> but the
History of <HI>Troy</HI> itself; shewing that Queen <HI>Dido</HI> never
knew <HI>Aeneas,</HI> who was dead a number of Years before she was born; and
that <HI>Brute</HI> was more probably a <HI>Gaulish</HI> Prince than a
<HI>Trojan.</HI> So proceeds to shew how this Island was anciently firm
Land with <HI>Gallia</HI>; naming several Authors of the same Opinion,
among whom are Sir <HI>Tho. More, John Twine,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Richard
White;</HI> also producing many Ar∣guments and Examples to maintain such a
Conjunction, and that there was an <HI>Isthmus</HI> which join'd our Island
at <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> about six Miles wide, whereby the
Island was some time Peninsular. Here we have several Instances of
the Intrusions and Demolitions which have been made by the Waters; how divers
Steeples in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> do yet appear at Low Water of the Towns
and Villages that have been drowned. And that it is reasonable to think
these flat and level Countries have been Sea; the great Evenness thereof
being so made by the Waters wherewith they have been cover'd. This is proved
by the Observations here made of the Shells and Bones of Sea-Fishes found
two Fa∣thoms deep in these Plains distant from the Sea; and we have here a
Sculpture of some which our Author had seen. As for the <HI>Fir-Trees</HI>
found also buried in these <HI>Netherlands,</HI> with the Roots commonly
lying South-West; as the Soil is not by nature apt to produce them, our
Author thinks they might be driven hither in the time of the Deluge. Anchors
are also observed to have been found deep in the Earth, and the Skeleton of
a Sea-Elephant in these Parts; whence it is concluded, that as these Parts
of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant</HI> are of Sea become Land, and cannot by
any In∣undation become Sea again, it must be owing to the break∣ing of the
<HI>German</HI> Ocean thro' that <HI>Isthmus</HI> which joined
<HI>Albion</HI> to <HI>Gallia.</HI> An Argument that this Separation from the
Continent was since the Flood, is urged from the great <PB N="306" REF="335"/>
Plenty of Wolves wherewith this Island was anciently in∣fested, which no
Man wou'd transport for the Goodness of the Breed out of the Continent into
any Island, no more than they will carry Foxes out of our Continent into the
Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI> They are therefore presumed to have passed over
of themselves, and grew most numerous till by King <HI>Edgar</HI>'s Orders
they were destroy'd throughout the Realm, before whose time two
<HI>British</HI> Kings, <HI>Madan</HI> and <HI>Mem∣pricius</HI> had been
killed by them.</P>
<P>Chapter the Fifth. <HI>Of the Arrival of the</HI> SAXONS <HI>out
of</HI> Germany <HI>into</HI> BRITAIN, <HI>and how they received the
Christi∣an Faith; possessed the best Part of the Country, called
it</HI> England, <HI>and leaving the Name of</HI> Saxons, <HI>came generally to
be called</HI> Englishmen. Here, after a little Note upon <HI>Brute</HI>'s
Entrance into <HI>Albion,</HI> about 3000 Years after the Creation, and
dividing <HI>Britain</HI> between his three Sons, <HI>Lo∣crine,</HI> who had
<HI>England; Albanact,</HI> who had <HI>Scotland</HI>; and <HI>Camber,</HI> who
had <HI>Wales;</HI> we have a short Remark upon the Original of the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and another on the <HI>Picts,</HI> shewing they were not so
called from painting of their Bodies, but from their being such notable
Fighters. Next we learn that the <HI>Britains</HI> were subject to the
<HI>Roman</HI> Government from <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> to <HI>Valentinian</HI>
the Third, that is, almost 500 Years; till relinquish'd by them, they
sought Protection in the second Year of King <HI>Vortiger</HI> against
the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who then
<HI>Anno</HI> 447 arrived under <HI>Hingistus</HI> and <HI>Horsus</HI> in
three great Ships to the number of 9000, ac∣cording to <HI>Pomarius</HI>: And
here we have a Sculpture repre∣senting their landing on the
<HI>British</HI> Coast, with those who were the first
<HI>Englishmen</HI> in this Island; and particular Accounts we here have of
those two Leaders, as to their Birth, Arms, Names, Building and Settlement in
<HI>Kent.</HI> Also an Ac∣count of <HI>Old England</HI> or <HI>Anglia,</HI>
whence they came, which was situate near <HI>Sleswick,</HI> with the
Signification of <HI>Angle, En∣gel,</HI> or <HI>England</HI>; and that it was
first caused to be so called by King <HI>Egbert:</HI> Also of the other
<HI>Saxons</HI> called <HI>Vites</HI> and <HI>Juites.</HI> The Signification of
<HI>Wassail.</HI> The Creation of <HI>Hingist</HI> King of <HI>Kent.</HI>
The Arrival of a second Supply of <HI>Saxon</HI> Forces. The Breach between
the <HI>Britains</HI> and <HI>Sax∣ons.</HI> The deposing of
<HI>Vortiger,</HI> enthroning of his Son <HI>Vor∣timer.</HI> The Slaughter of
<HI>Horsus</HI>; and Return of <HI>Hingist</HI> into <HI>Saxony</HI> for
more Forces. <HI>Vortiger</HI>'s Re-ascension of the Throne, and Alienation
from the <HI>Saxons.</HI> The bloody Banquet on <HI>May</HI>-Day at
<HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, in which 300 of <PB N="307" REF="336"/> the
<HI>British</HI> Nobility, or more, were treacherously massacred by the
<HI>Saxons</HI> under <HI>Hingist,</HI> at the watch Word <HI>Nem eowr
Seaxes,</HI> or take your Seaxes, which was their Swords or crooked Daggers,
whence they derived their Name. The Donation of <HI>Kent,</HI> &amp;c. to
<HI>Hingist</HI> confirm'd; and he reigned thirty four Years. After the
miserable Death of King <HI>Vor∣tiger,</HI> we have a Series or short
List of the <HI>British</HI> Kings, and the Years of their Reign to the
Death of <HI>Cadwalladar,</HI> whose Reign ended 685, when began six
Kingdoms more of the <HI>Saxons</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI>: So that in all, with
that of <HI>Kent</HI> they made an <HI>Heptarchy</HI>; and they are here
distinguished. Here also we have the Names of several Places in
<HI>Britain</HI> mention'd, which were changed by the <HI>Saxons,</HI>
particularly of <HI>London,</HI> that it was not so called by the
<HI>Britains</HI> from <HI>Luds∣town</HI>; Town being no <HI>British,</HI>
but a <HI>Saxon</HI> Word: Besides then <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> wou'd have
called it after that Name, but it was so called from the famous metropolitan
City of <HI>Lunden</HI> in <HI>Sconia,</HI> some time of greatest Traffic
in all the East Parts of <HI>Germany</HI>: Nor that <HI>Ludgate</HI> was so
call'd from King <HI>Lud,</HI> be∣cause Gate also is no <HI>British</HI>
Word, but was call'd <HI>Leod-geat,</HI> the Gate of the People or popular
Passage, in respect of the greater Concourse thro' the same than any
other in those Days. <HI>York</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> call'd
<HI>Euerwyc</HI> and <HI>Eberwyc,</HI> which by vulgar Abbreviation came to be
<HI>boric, uoric,</HI> and so <HI>York: Euer</HI> or <HI>Eber</HI>
signifying a wild Boar, and <HI>Wye,</HI> a Refuge, or Re∣treat; those
Beasts heretofore much infesting the Forest of <HI>Gautries</HI> within a
Mile of the Town, insomuch that there re∣mains a Toll call'd
<HI>Guid-Law,</HI> which is paid for Cattle at one of the Gates of the City,
which was granted for safe Conduct thro' the said Forest. Here follow
some Examples shewing how Auxiliaries or Assistants to
distressed Inhabitants make themselves Sharers in their Country; so
returning to <HI>Hingist,</HI> and his Successors; we have a more
particular Account of <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> who was the fourth in Descent from
him, and the first of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Monarchs who embraced the
Christian Faith; and of certain <HI>English</HI> Pagan Children, who being
a few Years before sold at <HI>Rome,</HI> were so admired by
<HI>Gregory</HI> for their Beauty upon his hearing they were called
<HI>Angles,</HI> that he thought them not without reason so called, for
that, as he said in allusion thereto, they had Faces like Angels. This St.
<HI>Gregory</HI> who was himself coming to <HI>England,</HI> being
af∣terwards made Pope, sent St. <HI>Augustine</HI> hither, who landed in
the Isle of <HI>Tanet,</HI> where King <HI>Ethelbert</HI> resorted to him.
And here we have a Representation in Sculpture of the <PB N="308" REF="337"/>
said King on his Throne under a Tree, with the Manner of St.
<HI>Austin</HI>'s bringing and preaching the Christian Faith, as
described in <HI>Bede.</HI> An Account of the said King's Con∣version and
others of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings; the Fruits thereof, and their Manner of
executing Deeds: With an Obser∣vation that 900 Years past our Language,
that of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands</HI> were all one. How our
Country came in general to be called <HI>England</HI> by King <HI>Egbert,</HI>
about the Year 800; with the Reason of our ancient Coin of <HI>Angels,</HI>
both thought to be promoted by the Allusion of <HI>Gregory</HI> aforesaid.
The Names of <HI>Shires</HI> given by King <HI>Alfred.</HI> And why the Name of
<HI>Welshmen</HI> was given to the <HI>Britains</HI> because they were of
the ancient <HI>Gauls</HI>; with several Ex∣amples from other Countries to
illustrate the same.</P>
<P>The sixth Chapter. <HI>Of the</HI> Danes <HI>and the</HI>
Normans, <HI>and their coming into</HI> ENGLAND, <HI>and how the</HI> ENGLISH
<HI>People have still retained the Body of the Realm.</HI> These
<HI>Danes</HI> are here observed to have renewed their ancient Wars against
the <HI>Saxons,</HI> now after they had been <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> about 350 Years,
and about 156 Years after they were become the sole Possessors of
that Part now called <HI>England.</HI> Here we have an Account of the Antiquity
of these People, and the Cause of their invading this Country. The
Mar∣tyrdom of St. <HI>Edmund.</HI> The dividing of the Kingdom be∣tween
<HI>Canutus</HI> the second King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Edmund
Ironside,</HI> and by what Acquisitions that <HI>Dane</HI> became the
greatest King for extent of Dominion that <HI>England</HI> ever had. Of his
Successors <HI>Harold</HI> and <HI>Hardicanute</HI>; which three
<HI>Danish</HI> Kings reigning about 27 Years, the Race of the <HI>Danes</HI>
were expell'd, and the <HI>English</HI> Line recovered again under <HI>Edward
the Confessor,</HI> who declared <HI>Edgar</HI> Heir of the Crown; but
<HI>Harold</HI> supplanting him, wore it till he lost both it and his Life
in Battle against <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> near
<HI>Hastings</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> in <HI>October</HI> 1066. Thus we
enter upon the History of the <HI>Normans:</HI> From whence they issued:
That they were Robbers by Sea: Of their o∣ther Invasions, and their Cruelty
therein. Of <HI>Rollo</HI>'s first coming into <HI>England,</HI> and of the
seven <HI>Norman</HI> Dukes from him down to that <HI>William.</HI> His
Resolution upon the En∣terprize of <HI>England,</HI> with the three Causes
thereof, tho' the Crown was never intended him, by <HI>Edward the
Con∣fessor,</HI> as by Reasons also appears. The Particulars of this
Expedition from <HI>Megissier, Oudegerst, Crantzius,</HI> &amp;c. His
great Number of Ships. The Place and Time of his land∣ing, 
<PB N="309" REF="338"/> and his Victory. The Miseries of the
<HI>English</HI> Nobility and Gentry thro' the Insolence of the
<HI>Normans</HI>; not unde∣served by such as rejected Prince <HI>Edgar</HI>
the lawful Heir to the Crown. The Honour of <HI>Kent.</HI> The
<HI>English</HI> flying into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Tongue first
spoken there. The Union between the Crowns of <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>England.</HI> The Revival of the <HI>English</HI> Credit; and the Death
of the Con∣queror after about 20 Years Reign; with an Account of his Burial,
and Epitaph in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English.</HI> A Computation, that of
the 3 or 400 Gentlemen he brought into <HI>England</HI> with him, whose Names
are in the Roll of <HI>Battail-Abbey,</HI> scarce one quarter of those
Names are now remaining; whence it is concluded that <HI>Englishmen</HI> are
not such a mixed Nation as some suppose.</P>
<P>The seventh Chapter. <HI>Of the great</HI> Antiquity <HI>of our
an∣cient</HI> English Tongue; <HI>and of the Propriety, Worthiness and
Amplitude thereof; with an</HI> Explanation <HI>of sundry our most
ancient</HI> English Words. Here it is asserted that the Ground of our
<HI>English</HI> is the <HI>Teutonic Tongue</HI>; and that this Language was
undoubtedly that, which, at the Confusion of <HI>Babel</HI> the
<HI>Teutonic</HI> People, or those conducted by <HI>Tuisco</HI> did
speak: One Instance given, is our using the Word <HI>babble,</HI> or
<HI>babbling,</HI> from <HI>Babel,</HI> when one speaks confused∣ly or
vain: Other Inferences from our Language, being at first mostly
Monosyllables. Here we have an Account of <HI>Becanus</HI> his Opinion, That
the <HI>Teutonic</HI> was the Language <HI>Adam</HI> spake in
<HI>Paradise,</HI> with his Reasons from the Inter∣pretation of the Words
<HI>Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Seth, E∣noch,</HI> &amp;c. Also of <HI>God, Devil,
Heaven, Hell, Man, Wo∣man,</HI> &amp;c. Here we have the Authorities of
<HI>Toletanus</HI> and <HI>Lipsius</HI> for the vast Extent of this ancient
Language, and a Censure upon the Wantonness of borrowing Words from the
<HI>French</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> in writing or speaking it. Instances of
this Age being given more to Variety than others. An Example of the Nearness
of our Language to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> How <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
came to speak broken <HI>Latin.</HI> Whence the Word <HI>Romance</HI> or
<HI>Romant</HI> is derived. Ex∣amples, shewing the <HI>Old French</HI> and
<HI>Old English</HI> were much alike; from <HI>Du Haillan; Otfridus</HI> his
Preface to the Gospels, translated about 800 Years past; and
<HI>Willeramus</HI> the Ab∣bot, his Translation, into <HI>Old French,</HI> of
<HI>Canticum Cantico∣rum.</HI> Of the <HI>Norman</HI> Mixture with our Tongue;
and that afterwards <HI>Chaucer</HI> was a great Mingler of <HI>English</HI>
with <HI>French</HI>; wherefore, tho' our Author reverences him as 
<PB N="310" REF="339"/> an excellent Poet for his Time, he is not of their
Opinion who call him the first Illuminator of the <HI>English Tongue</HI>;
and thinks he might have the greater Affection to the <HI>French</HI> Language,
because he was descended of a <HI>French</HI> or rather <HI>Walloon</HI>
Race. That since his Time, more <HI>La∣tin</HI> and <HI>French</HI> have been
admitted, than left out of our Tongue. From whence it is inferr'd that our
Language is discredited, by borrowing so much, even to the making our
selves unintelligible in our own Country, as that super∣fine Orator did who
declared, That 
<Q REND="inline">"as he itinerated, he obviated a rural Person,
and interrogating him concern∣ing the Transition of the Time, and the
Demonstration of the Passage, found him a meer Simplician:"</Q> Never
dreaming 'twas himself who made him so; and that if he had ask'd him in
plain <HI>English,</HI> What it was o'clock? And which was his way to the
Place he wanted? he might have had a satisfactory Answer. As such
Examples are apt to raise Derision even among our selves, much more may
Strangers be inclined to be merry with us at them; since they have nought
else for the Loan of their Words; dis∣daining to borrow of our Store, which
we have rendered so obsolete and uncouth, by despising the Use of it
our selves. As an Example of this Neglect, our Author here gives an Alphabet
of our most ancient <HI>English</HI> Words with their Ex∣planations in
above thirty Pages, and herewith concludes this Part.</P>
<P>The eighth Chapter consists of <HI>the Etymologies of the
an∣cient</HI> Saxon Proper Names <HI>of Men and Women.</HI> This be∣gins with
some general Rules to discern the <HI>Saxon Proper Names</HI>; which leads
us to the <HI>Alphabet</HI> of them, contain∣ing above thirty Pages; and
concludes with some Remarks upon the Wisdom of our said Ancestors in
the Choice and Significancy of them, according to the Custom of the
<HI>Hebrews,</HI> who so adapted, or had the like Propriety in their
<HI>Proper Names.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth Chapter shews <HI>how by the</HI> Surnames <HI>of the
Families of</HI> England <HI>it may be discerned from whence they take their
Originals, whether from the ancient</HI> English-Saxons, <HI>or from the</HI>
Danes <HI>or</HI> Normans. Here, after ob∣serving how the <HI>Saxons</HI>
having given Names to Places in <HI>England,</HI> which Places afterwards gave
Names to the Inha∣bitants, the Method is preferr'd, because our
<HI>Surnames</HI> are infinite, and it wou'd be tedious to specify a
Multitude of them at length, of chusing out the most usual Terminations, 
<PB N="311" REF="340"/> each to serve for a kind of general Rule, how to
appropri∣ate all such Names as do so end, or more clearly distinguish
thereby our ancient <HI>English</HI> Families; beginning with those ending
in <HI>all,</HI> proceeding to those ending in <HI>beke, berie,</HI> and so
thro' the whole Alphabet. After this we have another Alphabet of our ancient
Surnames which are of one Sylla∣ble, and sometimes serving for Terminations
of other Sur∣names: Some also of two Syllables, and not used to ter∣minate
other Surnames. At the end of this we have a ge∣neral Rule for the knowing of
<HI>English</HI> Families, which is if there be a <HI>k</HI> or a <HI>w</HI>
in the Name, neither the <HI>Latin,</HI> nor any of the three Languages
depending thereon, using those Letters; which sometimes causes
Confusion in their writing of our Names: A notorious Example whereof we have
in our renowned Sir <HI>John Hawkwood,</HI> who in the <HI>Latin</HI> Epitaph
upon his Monument at <HI>Florence,</HI> is written <HI>Joannes Acutus</HI>; the
<HI>h</HI> being left out as useless, the <HI>k</HI> and <HI>w</HI> as
unusual; and so, returned into <HI>English,</HI> they have made <HI>John
Sharp</HI> of him. Here follows an Observation upon such Surnames as have
been supposed to take their Original from the <HI>Danes:</HI> And lastly,
the Surnames coming from the <HI>Normans</HI>; the whole Chapter ending with a
Remark upon the <HI>British</HI> or <HI>Welch</HI> Names which are thought to
have been mixed with those of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Britains</HI>
being under Subjection to these People about 500 Years. And hence concludes,
the honourable Family of <HI>Cecils,</HI> being is∣sued from
<HI>Wales,</HI> is originally descended from the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth and last Chapter treats <HI>Of our ancient</HI>
English Titles <HI>of</HI> Honour, Dignities, <HI>and</HI> Offices; <HI>and
what they signify: Also the Signification of our</HI> English Names
<HI>of</HI> Dis∣grace <HI>or</HI> Contempt; beginning, in the first Part,
with the Name of King, and ending with <HI>Yeoman</HI> and <HI>Groom:</HI> And
in the second Part, beginning with <HI>Baud,</HI> and ending with
<HI>Thief.</HI> And this, with Notice of the <HI>Table</HI> or <HI>Index</HI>
at the end, of the special Points in the Book, may give a sufficient View
or Intimation of what is comprehended in the whole Work.</P>
<P>We shall here take our leave of it, with recommend∣ing, whenever
it arrives at another Impression, those A∣nimadversions to be added or
subjoined in their proper Places, which have been since occasionally made
on some Mistakes in it, by some learned Searchers into our Anti∣quities:
As those made by Mr. <HI>Sheringham</HI> on his Fancy of the <HI>Vitae,</HI>
being the ancient Inhabitants of the <HI>Isle</HI> of <PB N="312" REF="341"/>
<HI>Wight</HI>; on the <HI>Saxons</HI> being in <HI>Germany</HI> before they
came into the more northern Countries; and on <HI>Tuisco</HI>'s coming from
<HI>Babel,</HI> and giving the Name to <HI>Tuesday:</HI> But more
especially should be admitted, the Corrections of the learn∣ed Mr.
<HI>Somner,</HI> he having left large marginal Notes upon
<HI>Verstegan</HI>'s whole Book, as we are informed by Bishop
<HI>Kennet,</HI> the late accurate Author of his <HI>Life.</HI></P>

<P>THE accurate Author of this compendious Tract, having recited the
various Opinions which have been advanced about the time of the Foundation of
this University, which is justly reputed one of the most famous in the
World, says, it is chiefly concluded and agreed, that <HI>Alfred</HI> King of
the West <HI>Saxons,</HI> about the Year 872, was the principal Founder
thereof. And tho' by Wars, both before and since the Con∣quest, its ancient
Glory was much eclipsed, yet so has it been restored by succeeding
Princes, and other Benefactors, as to become conspicuous among the most
famous Acade∣mies in <HI>Europe:</HI> And however, the <HI>Hostels, Halls,
Inns, Schools,</HI> and Religious <HI>Houses,</HI> whereof, since the
Conquest it did consist, but now defaced or converted into the pre∣sent
Foundations there, were for their Number and that of the Students in them
beyond those now extant; yet true and solid Learning has latterly prevailed
there more than ever, and at this present there are eighteen goodly
<HI>Colleges</HI> and <HI>Houses</HI> maintained with the Lands and Reve∣nues
of their Founders, and seven <HI>Halls,</HI> where Students live at their own
Charge: Besides there are publick <HI>Schools,</HI> and a <HI>Library,</HI>
whose Fabric by the Bounty of many royal, noble, and religious Persons was
of late Years finished, which no University in the World can in all Points
parallel. Here follows their Names, the Times when, and Persons 
<PB N="313" REF="342"/> by whom they were founded, with an Account of their
present State.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>University College:</HI> Founded by King
<HI>Alfred, Anno Dom.</HI> 872, or in the second Year of his Reign, and the
Students were maintained out of the King's Exchequer till <HI>William</HI> the
Conqueror took the same from them. <HI>Willi∣am,</HI> Archdeacon of
<HI>Durham</HI> repaired and endowed it anew in 1217, and since by the Bounty
of Dr. <HI>Walter Skirlaw, Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland, Robert
Dudley</HI> Earl of <HI>Lei∣cester, Charles Greenwood,</HI> and others, the
Society and Re∣venues of this College are much encreased, so that there is
at present therein, a Master, eight Fellows, one Bible Clerk, with
Officers, Servants, and other Students to the number of 73.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Baliol College:</HI> Founded 1262, by <HI>John
Baliol,</HI> born in the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> and his Wife
<HI>Dervorgilla,</HI> Parents of <HI>John Baliol,</HI> King of <HI>Scots;</HI>
giving thereto Lands and Re∣venues for maintaining a Master, ten Fellows, and
eleven Scholars, which is recorded to be the first endowed College in this
University. It has since, by the Liberality of some Be∣nefactors here
named, and divers others, been much enlarged and adorned. The number of Fellows
are at the Discretion of the Visitor, Master, and three senior Fellows,
as the Revenues thereof encrease or decrease. There are at present one
Master, eleven Fellows, eleven Scholars for Exhibitioners, besides Officers
and Servants, in all 138.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Merton College:</HI> Founded 1274, by <HI>Walter de

<HI>Edward</HI> I. Endowing it in effect with all the Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which at present belong to it, appointing a Warden and no definitive number
of Fellows. Yet since, by the Bounty of Dr. <HI>John Williot,</HI> Sir
<HI>Thomas Bodley,</HI> Dr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Savil</HI>
Provost of <HI>Eton,</HI> who founded two Mathematic Lectures in the
University and took care for the Enlargement and Enrichment of this College;
besides some others; it is since much improv'd. There are at present
one Warden, twenty one Fellows, fourteen Scholars, besides Officers,
Servants, and other Students, in the whole 80.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Exeter College:</HI> Founded 1316, by <HI>Walter

under King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> II. by the Name of <HI>Stapuldon Hall;</HI>
endowing it for the Maintenance of one Rector and twelve Fellows, from whom,
one to be yearly chosen for the Government of the rest. In 1404 <HI>Edmund
Stafford</HI> Bishop of <HI>Exeter</HI> gave <PB N="314" REF="343"/> two
Fellowships, reformed the Statutes, and altered the Name. Afterwards Sir
<HI>William Peter</HI> Secretary of State to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> gave eight Fellowships, and aug∣mented the Wages of the
Fellows on the ancient Founda∣tion; Sir <HI>John Periam</HI> gave 560
<HI>l.</HI> Sir <HI>John Acland</HI> 800 <HI>l.</HI> and Dr. <HI>George
Hakewell</HI> (all three <HI>Devonshire</HI> Men) built the new Chapel. There

liberal Benefactors, so that there was now one Provost, eighteen Fellows,
twelve Pensioners or Exhi∣bitioners, and one Bible Clerk, besides Officers,

<P N="6">VI. <HI>Queen's College:</HI> Founded 1340, by <HI>Robert
Egles∣field</HI> Chaplain to Queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> Wife of King
<HI>Edward</HI> III. endowing the same for the Maintenance of a Provost and
twelve Fellows, to encrease with the Revenue; but by the Royal Bounties of
King <HI>Edward</HI> III. King <HI>Edward</HI> IV. Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
and King <HI>Charles,</HI> besides some Arch∣bishops and Bishops,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> here mention'd; there were at this time one Provost,
fourteen Fellows, seven Scholars, two Chaplains, and fourteen
Under-graduates; besides Officers, Servants, and other Scholars to the number
of 160.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>New College</HI>: Founded 1375, by <HI>William</HI>
of <HI>Wick∣ham</HI> alias <HI>Perot,</HI> who was Secretary to King
<HI>Edward</HI> III. Keeper of the Privy Seal, Bishop of
<HI>Winchester,</HI> Lord Treasurer and Lord Chancellor of
<HI>England</HI>; endowing the same for Maintenance of a Warden, seventy
Fellows and Scholars, ten Chaplains, three Clerks, one Organist, six∣teen
Choiristers, besides Officers and Servants. He also founded a College at
<HI>Winchester</HI> with one Warden, ten Fellows, two School-Masters, and
seventy Scholars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all maintained at his Charge; out of which
School, the best Scholars are chosen, to supply the vacant Places of the
Fel∣lows in the College at this University. Since by the Boun∣ty of several
Benefactors this College is much enrich'd, and the number in it is 135.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Lincoln College:</HI> Founded 1420, by <HI>Richard
Flem∣ing</HI> <PB N="315" REF="344"/> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> which he
endowed for the Mainte∣nance of one Rector, six Fellows, and two Chaplains;
af∣terwards augmented by other Benefactors, particularly <HI>Tho∣mas Scot</HI>
alias <HI>Rotheram,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> Chancellor of
<HI>England</HI> and of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and Secretary to four Kings; who
when he was Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> did much enlarge the Buildings of this
College, and augment the Fellowships, as did afterwards several others: And
there were now one Rector, fifteen Fellows, two Chaplains, four Scholars,
be∣sides other Students and Officers, amounting to 109.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>All Souls College:</HI> Founded 1437, by Dr.
<HI>Henry Chichely</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who procured King
<HI>Henry</HI> VI. to give thereto four Priories Alians, and en∣dowed his
Structure for maintaining one Warden and forty Fellows, who were to be Divines
and Civilians, appointing that the number of Fellows should never be
augmented nor impaired; and that all Vacancies should yearly be sup∣ply'd:
He also gave Maintenance for Chaplains, Clarks, and Choiristers
<HI>sans</HI> number. Since then, Cardinal <HI>Pole,</HI> Sir <HI>W.
Peter,</HI> King <HI>Edward,</HI> Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI>
were Bene∣factors thereunto. And there were now one Warden, forty Fellows, two
Chaplains, three Clerks, six Choiristers, be∣sides other Students and
Officers, in all 70.</P>
<P N="10">X. <HI>Magdalene College:</HI> Founded 1459, by <HI>William
Pattin,</HI> commonly called <HI>Wainfleet</HI> from the Place of his Birth,

Lord Chancellor of <HI>England.</HI> He endowed the same for the Maintenance
of one President, forty Fellows, thirty De∣mies or Scholars, four Chaplains,

<P>THIS Tract, written by the same Hand with the former, as appears
by the Manner and Method of it, begins al∣so with reciting the various
Opinions about the Foundation of this University; but says, the chiefest
agree, That <HI>Sige∣bert</HI> King of the <HI>East Angles</HI> was the
principal Founder thereof, about the Years 630 and 636; who assigned divers
Hostels and Houses for the Students, giving them large Privileges and
Charters, whereof some are yet extant; and procuring also great Immunities
from Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> I. which <HI>Sergius</HI> I. confirm'd. Since which
time, tho' by Wars, both before and since the Conquest, it was much
de∣faced; yet recovering itself, it is reputed one of the most famous
Universities in the World. Much Honour it has received by the many Sons and
Nephews of Kings who have been <HI>Earls</HI> thereof. And tho' the ancient
Hostels and Houses were more numerous, yet at present it consists of
sixteen goodly Colleges and Halls, erected and maintain'd with the Lands of
their several Founders; some whereof no University can in all Points
parallel: And they are as follows.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>St. Peter's College</HI> or <HI>House:</HI> Founded
1280, by <HI>Hugo de Basham,</HI> afterwards Bishop of <HI>Ely.</HI> He
settled the Endow∣ments two Years after for one Master and fourteen
Fel∣lows, and died before all Things were finish'd. Other Bi∣shops 
<PB N="319" REF="348"/> of <HI>Ely</HI> afterwards added to their Means; and in
pro∣cess of time arose many Benefactors, who are several of them here
named. This College being the first, now standing in this University,
hath in it a Master, nineteen Fellows, twen∣ty nine Bible Clerks, eight poor
Scholars, besides other Students, Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in all 106.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>University House,</HI> now <HI>Clare Hall:</HI>
Founded 1326, by <HI>Richard Badew,</HI> Chancellor; wherein the Students lived
the first sixteen Years at the University Charge. Afterwards, the first
Foundation was resigned into the Hands of <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> Countess of
<HI>Clare,</HI> sometime Wife of <HI>John de Burgo</HI> Earl of
<HI>Ulster</HI>; which <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had formerly bestowed Fa∣vours
upon this College. She then, under Licence of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. altered
the Name to her own. By whose Be∣nefactions and those of others after her,
there is a Master, eighteen Fellows, thirty six Scholars, twenty poor
Scholars, besides other Students, Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 106.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Pembroke Hall:</HI> Founded 1343, by <HI>Mary St.

Doctor in Physick and a learned Antiquary in 1557 was made a Co-Founder by
Letters Patents; who caused it to be called after both their Names. He added
to the former Quadrangle his fair Building of Free Stone, encreased the
Treasury, and en∣riched it for maintaining three Fellows, twenty Scholars,
and a Porter. Since it had many other Benefactors, some of whom are here
named, who farther augmented it: So <PB N="320" REF="349"/> that there is a
Master, twenty five Fellows, one Chaplain, sixty nine Scholars, besides

<HI>Henry</HI> VII. partly finished the Stone-Work of the Chapel, and his
Successor pav'd, glazed, and finished it. By succeeding Benefactors the
whole has been much enriched; and the College maintains at pre∣sent, a
Provost, 70 Fellows and Scholars, three Chaplains, one Master of the

<HI>relating to the Institution, Arms, and Characters of the</HI> KNIGHTS
<HI>of the</HI> GARTER: <HI>With the Ceremonies of the ancient</HI> ORDER
<HI>of the</HI> BATH; <HI>illuminated in their proper Colours,</HI> and adorn'd
with the <HI>Pourtraits</HI> or <HI>Limnings</HI> of several <HI>noble
Personages,</HI> &amp;c. Fol. MS.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS ancient and valuable Collection begins with a Copy of the
<HI>Interpretation</HI> of, and <HI>Additions</HI> to <HI>the Statutes of the
Order of the Garter,</HI> made by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. with the Advice and
Assent of the Companions of the said Order on the 29th Day of
<HI>May,</HI> in the eleventh Year of his Reign. There are Additions and
Interlineations in several Places, of some Corrections or Amendments in the
hand-writing of Sir <HI>Thomas Wriothesley;</HI> and is intitled at the top
of one of the Pages, <HI>The now Statutes.</HI> This consists of nine
Pages, and is followed with <HI>The Ordon∣naunces for the Officers of the
Order;</HI> in the beginning of which, the said King <HI>Henry</HI> is called
<HI>Renovator</HI> of the no∣ble Order of St. <HI>George,</HI> in the 13th year
of his Reign or 1521. This Part treats of the five Officers of the said
Or∣der; who are the <HI>Prelate, Chancellor, Register, King of Arms</HI>
called <HI>Garter,</HI> and the <HI>Huissier of Arms</HI> named the
<HI>Black Rod</HI>; declaring the Charge or Duty of every one of them, and
their Privileges, Habits, Wages, and Liveries; also the Liberties and
Privileges granted to the thirteen Poor Knights, as is expressed in the
Introduction thereof. Moreover, here are the Pourtraits or Limnings of these
five Officers, in their proper Robes and Ensigns of the Order, and all in
their proper Colours. This Part fills eight Pages, but there seems to be a
Leaf wanting at the end, because it breaks off abruptly in the Account of the
Usher of the Black Rod and his Salary; and there is wholly wanting the
Privileges of the Poor Knights as before promised. Next follows, which
perhaps should have been bound first in the Book, a Translation of the
first Founder King <HI>Edward</HI>'s <HI>Statutes of the Order.</HI>
Beginning thus, 
<Q REND="inline">"In the worshipp of God, Seynt <HI>Marie</HI>
the glorious Virgyn, and Seynt <PB N="324" REF="353"/> <HI>George;</HI> our
Sovereygn Lord, <HI>Edward</HI> the Thirde Kyng of <HI>Englonde</HI> aftir the

<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> These Articles are comprised in four∣teen Pages,
ending with these Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"And also the said Colier shall not be
sold, put to pledge, given, nor aliened, for neede, or cause whatsoever
that it be."</Q> There are some marginal Notes on it, in the same Hand as
in the foregoing Draught; and in the Margin at the End this Inscription, TH.
WR. <HI>A. R. Greek</HI>; which as we have been inform'd by a very knowing
Person in these Studies, signifies <HI>Thomas Wriothesley King of Arms
of Grekelade</HI>; and under that in the same hand, is also this
Inscription, <HI>Sta∣tuta Regis H.</HI> VII<SUP>mi</SUP> <HI>tempore translata
Anglice per</HI> JO. WR. signifying, that these Statutes were thus
translated in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. by <HI>John
Wriothesley</HI> King of Arms. Following this, in the same Page there is
written, but in a∣nother Hand, (which has been supposed to be <HI>John
Stow's</HI>) <HI>Necessaryes of a strange Prince chosen a Brother and a
Com∣panion of the Order of the Garter.</HI> Also, <HI>The Othe of a Kyng
byeng a Stranger when he recevyth the Order of the Garter.</HI></P>
<P>After a Copy of an old Deed, in another hand, upon the next Leaf,
executed in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. we enter upon a View of the
Arms and Crests of the Knights of the Garter, blazon'd all in their proper
Colours. There may be near two hundred, most of them finish'd, in the
compass of about seventy Pages; and what is a very great Curiosity in a
Work of this nature, we have the Badges to about fourscore of them, painted
or drawn with a Pen, against, or at the sides of so many of the said
Coats. Fur∣ther, what still inhances its value to the historical
Inspector, is, that not only the Names of most of the Knights Com∣panions 
<PB N="325" REF="354"/> are appropriated to the greater part of those Arms,
but Characters also given of upwards of threescore of them, containing a
short Account of their Actions, Marriages, Is∣sues, Benefactions, Death
and Burial. Which Particulars of such ancient Record, as this Writing, and
these Draughts seem to be, must be esteemed most authentic, as being
so near the original Fountains of Intelligence. In the seventh Page of
these Draughts we find, against one of the Coats, this Writing; 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> 20 <SUP>li</SUP>
Gowne, JO. WR."</Q> and against the next, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Maximilian</HI> King of <HI>Romains,</HI>
transolatt to the Princs stall; Gowne, Clothe of Gold, furred with Martres;
the Cape of <HI>Bever.</HI> JO. WR."</Q> and against the next, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Phillipp</HI> King of <HI>Castille,</HI>
Archiduc of <HI>Awstriche:</HI> Gowne, Clothe of Gold, lyned with Damaske; 40
<HI>Scutes</HI> for Dobelet. TH. WR."</Q> The former part of this Work seems
plainly as old as King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. because in the third Page of
these Draughts, where his Arms and Badges are display'd, it is thus written
of him, 
<Q REND="inline">"and <HI>nowe gloriously reigneth owre Soveryne
Lord King</HI> Henry <HI>the VII.</HI> whiche in his Youthe hathe endured many
greate <HI>Duresse</HI>; and blessed by God hathe wonne two great
Bataillis; the fyrst, the Bataile of <HI>Redmore,</HI> &amp;c. the seconde,
the Bataile of <HI>Stoke,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> Yet four Leaves further we have
this In∣scription over the Arms of that King's Son, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Duc of <HI>Yorc, Henry,</HI> aftir Prynce,
and aftir King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Eight;</HI> wiche conqred the Cytes of

Wriothesley</HI> Garter King of Arms was Author of some of these
Cha∣racters, and Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> who was Garter afterwards, and died 26
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Weever</HI>'s <HI>Fun.
Mon.</HI> fol. 660. who says Sir <HI>Thomas Wall</HI> succeeded him that

entitled the Collection to him.</P>
<P>The principal Personages whose Arms, Badges, and Cha∣racters
are thus drawn forth, are first, King <HI>Edward</HI> III. who, in his
beginning did many great Acts, here briefly mention'd. After him, King
<HI>Richard</HI> II. who kept a tri∣umphant Houshold, built
<HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> and made many Dukes and Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>

Schene;</HI> the Officer of <HI>Garter</HI> Principal King of Arms, and divers
other Foundations. After him, King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. an holy Man; for whom God
shewed many Miracles; for he was more heavenly than worldly: He was first
buried at <HI>Chartsey,</HI> and now is removed to the Colege of
<HI>Wyndesore,</HI> where he was born. Next, King <HI>Edward</HI> IV. Flower

in his tender Age; a Fader in nourture, and a Patron; died in the Castell of
<HI>Rouen</HI>; no∣bly enterred in the College of <HI>Warwick.</HI> Afterwards
we have such another short Character of <HI>Waultier</HI> first Lord 
<PB N="328" REF="357"/> <HI>Hungerford,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of
<HI>Rivers.</HI> Also of Sir <HI>James Audeley,</HI> a noble Warrior, who

<HI>Poitiers:</HI> And of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Talbot</HI> Earl of

Lord <HI>Duras</HI>; who, for <HI>England</HI>'s Sake, left
<HI>Gascongue</HI>; was long Marshall of <HI>Calais;</HI> attended King
<HI>Edward</HI> in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> &amp;c. And lastly Sir <HI>Thomas
Mongomery</HI> a wise Knight, and of King <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth's
Counseil, and with him in all his noble Deeds; whiche ofte was sente in
Ambassade to Ducs, Princes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus we end our Survey of
this Part, containing the Arms and Characters of our an∣cient Knights of the
Garter down to, about the middle of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. his
Reign.</P>
<P>On the second Page of the same Leaf where the former Work
ends, begins another of a different kind, being nothing but Pourtraiture
without any Introduction or verbal Ex∣planation, and continues for twenty four
Pages successively. It contains a distinct Representation in so
many painted Draughts of the ancient Ceremonies used in creating the
<HI>Knights of the Bath.</HI> The Figures in these Limnings, tho' they are
not every where in exact Proportion, or finely finish'd off to the Eye, are
yet so very observable for the punctual Regard that seems to have been
paid to the due Representation of all Parts of the Solemnity, all proper
Per∣sons that should appear, all Officers and Attendants, with all the
Distinction of Habits, Ornaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that above fourscore
Years since these Draughts were thought worthy of being graved and brought
into Print<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>In <HI>Nich. Upton</HI> de Studio
Milit. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Fol. <HI>Lond.</HI> 1654.</BIBL></NOTE>; wherefore we
shall only observe further of them here, that in the said Sculpture they
are nothing so intelligent as in these the original Paintings, because
the whole Ceremony being con∣tracted all into one Sheet Print, and the Colours
all reduced to black and white, we are deprived of several remarkable 
<PB N="329" REF="358"/> Distinctions in the said Copy, which in these
Illuminations might give great Light to some Parts of our History and
Antiquities.</P>
<P>After these Views of this Ceremony we have, two or three Tables
or Genealogies of <HI>Hungary</HI>; of the Kings of <HI>Castille,</HI> and
the <HI>Fitzhardings,</HI> &amp;c. Then we come to some Pourtraits of certain
noble Personages two in a Leaf, at full length, painted in their proper
Habits and Robes for twelve Pages together. Among these are King
<HI>Edward</HI> I. and his Queen; <HI>Richardus de Monthermer</HI> Earl of
<HI>Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> with <HI>Joanna</HI> Lady
<HI>Acres</HI> his Wife, Daughter of that King; <HI>Tho. de Monthermer</HI> his
Son, and <HI>Edward</HI> his Son: Also <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>William
de Montacute,</HI> and <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Thomas de Monthermer;
John</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> his Son, with their
Countesses; <HI>Richard Nevyle</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and his
Lady <HI>Alice; Richard Nevil</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Anne</HI>
his Lady; King <HI>Richard</HI> III. and his Queen <HI>Anne; William</HI> Lord
<HI>Ferres</HI> of <HI>Groby,</HI> and Lady <HI>Mar∣garet</HI> his Wife; also
the Duke of <HI>Exeter</HI> and his Dutchess. Of which Pictures the Men,
being most of them in Ar∣mour; have their Helmets closed over their Faces,
all but the two King <HI>Richards,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI>
Sons of <HI>Richard de Monthermer.</HI> After these we have in four Pages
more, some unfinished Draughts of the Standard Bearers; between two of
which are some of the Knights Companions of the first and second Stall
mention'd.</P>
<P>Then follow a few Leaves of some Coats of Arms with∣out Crests
or Badges, and a <HI>Pedigree</HI> of <HI>Dampetre, Earl</HI> of
<HI>Flanders</HI>; with a Draught of two or three monumental Fi∣gures: And then
we come to an Account of the <HI>Fees that</HI> William Brugys <HI>alias</HI>
Garter <HI>had of the Prelate and Knights of the Order, besides the
Sovereign:</HI> Which <HI>Brugys</HI> was in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> V.
and King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. in his Be∣ginning. Also a Memorandum of about
sixteen <HI>Knights who were created Peers in the Reign of King</HI> Henry
<HI>VI.</HI> and the Days when. The next is a List of the <HI>Knights of the
Garter the Third of King</HI> Edward <HI>VI.</HI> in <HI>French</HI>; but
either the Account is not finished, or the number of them were then but
Eighteen including the Sovereign. The next Piece is the <HI>Pedigree of the
Lord</HI> Perse <HI>of</HI> Luxemburgh <HI>Earl of Saint Poule.</HI> Towards
the Conclusion of this Pedigree, we learn that it was made for the Lady
<HI>Margaret Vaux,</HI> and that the Brother of this Lady was named
<HI>William</HI> Lord of the <HI>Vaux,</HI> who was then alive: And further we
have these <PB N="330" REF="359"/> Words, 
<Q REND="inline">"Lo now have ye the Pedigree of the Fader, of the
Moder of my Lady <HI>Margaret</HI> of the <HI>Vaux</HI> now be∣yng alyve, Moder
unto Therle of <HI>Sent Powle,</HI> and unto <HI>Thebaut</HI> Lord
<HI>Fynes,</HI> now beyng Bisshop of <HI>Manns,</HI> and of my Lord
<HI>Jakes</HI> of <HI>Lugburgh,</HI> and of the Doghter my Lady
<HI>Jaquetto</HI> Duches of <HI>Bedford,</HI> my Lady <HI>Isabell</HI>
Countess of <HI>Mayn,</HI> and of my Lady <HI>Kateryn</HI> Duches of
<HI>Britayn,</HI> now all beyng on lyve."</Q> And here ends, as we conjecture,
the ancient Collections in this Book which were made, for the most part, by
the <HI>Wriothesleys,</HI> that is, all but a few of the odd Pedigrees, and
perhaps also one or two of the last Articles which are here mention'd. For
we observe all the Paper (except one Leaf, containing only an Illumination of
some monumental Ornament, and might be inserted at the last binding up of
the Volume) from the Be∣ginning of the Knights of the Garter's Arms to this
Place, has one Maker's Mark upon it, <HI>viz.</HI> Three <HI>Flower de
Luces</HI> in a <HI>Scutcheon</HI> with a <HI>Coronet</HI> over it.</P>
<P>What follows in this Volume (bound into it by a later Owner) are,
first, two Sheets printed in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, the one from a
Copper-Plate, and is called, <HI>The Uni∣on of the Roses of the Families
of</HI> Lancaster <HI>and</HI> York: With the <HI>Arms</HI> of those who
have been chosen of the most Honora∣ble <HI>Order</HI> of the
<HI>Garter,</HI> from that Time to this Day, 1589. It was composed, that is
the Arms and Dates were settled by <HI>Thomas Talbot</HI> a noted Antiquary
of those Times, and graved by <HI>Jodocus Hondius</HI> of <HI>Flanders</HI>
in <HI>London</HI> the Year above∣mention'd. The other Sheet is stuck upon
Canvas, and is so soil'd 'tis scarce legible; but it contains a short
Account in <HI>Latin</HI> of all the Orders of Knighthood Ecclesiastical or
Civil that are famous thro' the Christian World. I think it is dedicated to
Dr. <HI>Tho. Hesketh</HI> by <HI>John Clapham.</HI></P>
<P>There are further two <HI>Latin</HI> Tracts in this Volume, which
also never belonged originally to the aforesaid Collections, but are both
bound in with them, (Parchment Covers and all) the one called <HI>Libertates
Collegii.</HI> The other contains the Accounts of <HI>Owen Oglethorp</HI>
Treasurer of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel, from the last Day of
<HI>October</HI> in the 38th of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the last of
<HI>September</HI> in the first of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. The rest of the
Book consists only of several Sheets of the printed Titles and painted
Arms of some Knights of the Garter in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's
time; such as are usu∣ally dispersed at their Installations, and only
bound in here, at the End, to make it a Volume as portly and magni∣ficent 
<PB N="331" REF="360"/> to outward Appearance, as it is intrinsically
valuable. The Care of thus gathering and binding together these Col∣lections
is owing to that eminent Antiquary and Herald Mr. <HI>Elias Ashmole,</HI>
whose Book it appears to have been by the Impression of his Arms which we
see on the Cover: But the Liberty of thus obliging the Publick with the
Contents of it, we owe to the gracious Favour of a noble Peer, who is most
worthily possessed thereof; having besides the Ge∣nerosity of this
Communication, also been at no small Ex∣pence in honouring the Memories of
those illustrious Per∣sonages whose Pourtraitures are before
mention'd.</P>

<P>THIS Work, replenish'd with Variety of learned Autho∣rities from
the Ancients, and historical Examples of all Times, is dedicated to Sir
<HI>Francis Walsingham,</HI> from <HI>Ho∣ward</HI> House, by <HI>Henry
Howard,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>North∣ampton</HI> and Lord <HI>Privy
Seal.</HI> The noble Author, ingeni∣ously bespeaks the Patronage of his
Friend, in the said De∣dication, by introducing it with an Allusion from
<HI>Vitruvius</HI>; who allows, 
<Q REND="inline">"no Building to be fully finished, which wants a
Cover to bear out a Storm."</Q> Therefore, having made an end of this rude
Pile, presumes to grace it with the <HI>Lou∣ver</HI> of his honourable Name.
Further confessing his par∣ticular Affection and Zeal to him was so much
increased from his stedfast Friendship in the Days of Proof, that not
only his Hand was ready to subscribe, but his Heart with∣all to acknowledge
the great Merit of his undeserved Fa∣vour. <PB N="332" REF="361"/> For who may
be more securely trusted in the Port of Liberty, than he that once
vouchsafed with a favourable Hand to waft him out of the Surges of uncertain
Chance? And a little further, we observe, that from the sixteenth Year of
his Age till this Day, his Custom had been, in the Course of his Reading to
store up all such Reasons and Ex∣amples as occurr'd in Philosophy, the
Civil Laws, Divinity, or Histories, to the Ruin of pretended Prophets and
their Prophesies. The Readers, of whose Censure he is most
ap∣prehensive, are of three Sorts: The first, looking not into the Subject
but the Writer, with such Partiality, that <HI>Battus</HI> shall sooner
be crowned with Laurel, if he bear their Li∣very, than <HI>Homer</HI> with an
Ivy Garland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The second Sort, are the close sullen
Censors, who injure no less by si∣lent Scorn and malicious Innuendos,
than by open Exclama∣tions. And the last kind, are the false Prophets and
their Favourites, who neither upon Spleen against the Writer, nor overweening
of themselves, but only with a mortal Fear lest their <HI>Diana</HI>
should be robb'd of her silver Shrine, are like to bend their whole
Endeavour against the Con∣tempt of their inveterate Abuses. This is
followed with some curious Reflections upon the Vanity of Prophesies and
Oracles; by the utmost Pretensions whereof, we cannot alter the determinate
Course which is prefixed in the Provi∣dence of God, nor prognosticate of
any future Accident. We may change our Vessel, like Sea-sick
Passengers, but not our Pain; our Bed, but not our Fit; our Climate, but
not our Quality: For he that stinted and confined us to Go∣vernment upon the
Ground, forbade us, as it were by Con∣sequence, <HI>ambulare in
Mirabilibus;</HI> and he that made us ig∣norant of many present Matters for
our own Behoof, would not entangle us with Guesses and Conjectures <HI>de
futuris,</HI> for a greater Inconveniency. The Trees which are most backward
in putting forth their Blossoms, prosper long; whereas Almonds are most
commonly decay'd and starv'd by the Frost, for putting out before their
Fellows. Of Time past, there is no Comfort; of Joy present, no Stay; of
Chance future, no Certainty. Why then should not all Sorts of feigned
Prophets look into the Devil's Craft? Who deals like the Eagle with a
Shell-fish, or a cunning Wrestler with his Mate, in hoisting us up to the
nicest, and most fickle Points, that afterwards the Fall may be more
dangerous, and his Prey easy; which would never come to pass, if Men would
look into the Works of God with the Eyes of Hum∣bleness, 
<PB N="333" REF="362"/> not pry into the Secrets of his Purpose, with the
Spectacles of Vain-Glory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then, after submitting to the
Judgment of his said Patron, whether this Work should be destroy'd or
committed to the Press, and praying that he might be blessed with his
heavenly Favour in as ample Mea∣sure as himself had tasted of his
honourable Friendship, he concludes this <HI>Dedication</HI>; which is
followed with a short <HI>E∣pistle</HI> to the <HI>Reader.</HI> Wherein we
perceive he has reformed to advantage his first proposed Method of
dispatching all his Answers to the several Branches of Prophesy
together in one Mass or Lump, before the winding up of the Dis∣course, by
answering every Part distinctly under its proper Head, for good Reasons
here given. After which he had some Thoughts of detecting the false Virtues
and Properties imposed upon Herbs and Stones; but considering how
de∣spicable these Abuses were held in the Days of <HI>Sozomen,</HI> and
that such Fantasies come never further out of Season, than when grave
Matters are debated with Authority, he pur∣sued no further this Purpose: So
closes his Epistle with his good Wishes to his Reader.</P>
<P>The Work it self is introduced with the Story of
<HI>Ulysses</HI> loitering with <HI>Circe</HI> the Sorceress, in his
return from <HI>Troy</HI>; and the Confession of <HI>Echinis</HI> a reputed
Prophet, how vain all Pretensions are this Way. Here we have a Division of
<HI>Prophesies,</HI> into divers Kinds, with a Rejection of them, and a
compendious Way offer'd to be satisfied in the Ju∣stice of such Treatment
thereof. First, by pointing out the Causes which induce Men to embark their
Hope on so faithless a Bottom as that of Prophesies. Secondly, by
disproving all these Kinds thereof, to make it appear what Pains have been
taken to seduce the illiterate and unthink∣ing Part of Mankind. Thirdly, by
shewing how our ad∣hering to such Vanities is inconsistent with the
Duty of a true Subject or a good Christian; from which <HI>Data</HI> or
Prin∣ciples is to be known what kind of Prophets may be tole∣rated in a State.
Fourthly and lastly, by giving a full An∣swer to such Arguments as have
been used in Defence of such Practices. The first Cause then, is a
Desire in Man to soar above the State he was put in by God. Secondly, a
Distrust of God; while we think he is not as willing by his Mercy, as able
by his Might to help us. Thirdly, a Credu∣lity in being apt to believe things
we wish may come to pass: Also shewing that many Times there needs no
more to the making a Prophet than a natural and easy Deduc∣tion 
<PB N="334" REF="363"/> of an Effect from a Cause; with several Instances
here∣of. Fourth and lastly, an Impatience to know beforehand, the Revolutions
of Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here we have some Reflections on the Burden
of Honour, the Depravity of Ambition, and Vanity of Divination; that it is
unwarranted both by Divinity and Philosophy: That if Reason cannot
compass it, neither will any other Principle in Man; and in what Cases he
may be provident, but not prophetic: That Melancholy is insufficient to
qualify Men with this Fa∣culty: And that Passion is the Parent thereof, as
<HI>Porphiry</HI> maintain'd, is proved erroneous. Hence we pass to</P>
<P>Chap. II. Of <HI>Dreams. Plato</HI> the chief Patron of them. No
Certainty to be gathered from any Thing he has writ on this Head.
<HI>Aristotle</HI> nearer the Truth; who maintains, That the Limits of our
Knowledge are adequate only to the Strength or Abilities of the Soul, which in
its present State, being always immersed in Matter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
seems unable, upon the Reception of Images in sleep, to judge whether they
are answer'd by any Thing external or no. If Sleep were a Means to discover
Things to come, then the sounder and deeper the Sleep, the greater would be
the Discovery; but we find contrariwise, that Things of Moment are revealed
in slumbers. This Kind of Divination moreover is contin∣gent to the Vulgar,
and not to the best and wisest sort of Men; and Dreams are the
Amusement also of Infants, and even Brutes as well as human Creatures: The
most affecting, often broken, confused and effaced out of the Memory.
Af∣ter some Reasons of the Ancients for raising our Regard to Dreams, we
have our Author's for not heeding them. As 1. That since they are so soon
forgot, the Print they make must needs be shallow. 2. That no judicious Man
will chuse Fancy for his Guide; but Dreams are Fancies. 3. If Al∣legories
please us, <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Robe was of Purple with a Gloss, not
shadowy. 4. The Gods are wont to reveal their Mysteries to Men sober and
discreet; but we find none dream more than the Fickle and Ungodly. 5. God,
who is Purity itself, will not make Dreams the Shadows of his ordinary Grace.
6. We may not expect him to give so fair a Colour for Man to depend more upon
the Pride of his Nature which is frail, than upon the Rule of Providence which
is certain. 7. To be exploded, as what would be Causes of Strife and Debate.
8. And withdraw our Mind from our Duty. 9. As they could not be
distinguished, the Certain from the Frivolous. 10. As they could not be 
<PB N="335" REF="364"/> valued for Grounds of Truth without detracting from the
sacred Majesty. 11, and lastly, As we are not to measure Truth by the
Line of Imagination. Moreover, if any Aim were to be taken or Guide design'd
from Dreams, some Interpreters would be found so expert that we could not
err; but they appear not: And tho' the Events should answer some
Expositions, who can say this is not Chance? As for admitting some Dreams
to have been suggested by An∣gels, they cannot be admitted for ordinary
Dreams, therefore make not for the Diviner's Trade. And since neither any
Dreams bring one Effect to divers Persons, nor to the self-same at all
Times, it may be taken for a senseless Practice to justify the Follies
of a number by the Events of some. And con∣cerning God's not revealing
himself by this Means, as well now, as he may have anciently done, here are
Reasons given to shew that his Will in this Point is not correspond∣ent
with his Power. Hence we proceed to</P>
<P>Chap. III. Of <HI>Oracles.</HI> And here we have the ridicu∣lous
Accounts which the Heathens gave of Divinations thereby, exposed. With
<HI>Cicero</HI>'s Notion, That the Mind being inspired or blown up by certain
Vapours or Exhala∣tions, deliver'd those Oracles. And <HI>Cotta</HI>'s
Question to the Collectors of <HI>Apollo's</HI> Offering, <HI>viz.</HI> If he
were a God, why did he shrowd himself in the Bowels of the Earth? That the
Island <HI>Delphos,</HI> where stood the Idol of <HI>Apollo,</HI> was
inspired by Exhalations from the Ground, as main∣tained by <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
but disproved by our Author; who ascribes the Prophesies from such
Effect, more to the Plough∣men than the Priests. His Comparison of the
Fable, which supposes the first Prophet to have been found by Chance in
an old Vault in <HI>Hetruria,</HI> to the Tale in <HI>Nubrigensis,</HI>
concerning two young Children brought to <HI>Wolpet</HI> in <HI>Suf∣folk</HI>
with an Eastern Wind. The Answer of <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Proc∣tors to the
Question of some Philosophers, why <HI>Delphos</HI> remaining the same
in Substance, Situation, and Quality as usual, was notwithstanding
deprived of the Virtue of afford∣ing Oracles, if Exhalations were interested
in the Cause: With the Shift of <HI>Demetrius</HI> upon this Objection.
Also, the Argument of a wild Man for the Silence of this Ora∣cle; who said,
<HI>Apollo</HI> was doing Penance for certain Fami∣liarities with
<HI>Daphne,</HI> &amp;c. So could not attend as usual, to the giving out
Oracles. <HI>Cicero</HI> confesses this Silence; but evades the Debate of
the Cause. And the Opinions of o∣thers <PB N="336" REF="365"/> are produced;
but the coming of <HI>Christ</HI> is concluded to be the real Occasion of
such Silence.</P>
<P>Chap. IV. Of <HI>Astrology.</HI> Its Definition. That the
Houses, Faces, Images, Aspects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which it ascribes to
Planets, are neither apparent to Sense, nor revealed in Philosophy: That it
is impossible for one or all the Planets to suppress the Properties of
Nature; as that a Child which is born under a frowning Planet should never
laugh. A cold Pro∣perty in Planets vainly asserted. The
<HI>Peripatetic</HI> Principle, that no Planet, the Moon excepted, changes
Property, but by regard of Place. The Opinion of others, that all Planets are
favourable in their Kind, but forced to degenerate by Malice in the Bodies on
which they work. That they work according to the Matter which they find,
without giving a second Nature, or correcting the first. The Rea∣son why
St. <HI>Augustine</HI> renounced this Study of the Stars, with the ridiculous
Subdivision of the <HI>Zodiac</HI> by the Pre∣tenders to this Art. The
Conceits about the <HI>Aspects</HI> of the Planets, sufficiently shaken
by this Rule in Philosophy: That the Disposition of divers Causes
tending to one certain End, cannot forego their Virtue by meer Distance, and
nothing else. Things sublunary only subject to Passions and
Affec∣tions; and, therefore, not the supream Bodies or their Beams, as
Astrologers imagine. Upon what the Consideration of <HI>Aspects</HI>
depends. The Notion of Aspects taken up, in the Author's Opinion, from the
sundry Shapes and Figures of the Moon. Next is the Divination from certain
Parts of a Planet confuted, by the Authority of its Inventors. That the
<HI>Chaldees</HI> admitted but eleven Signs: the Forms of which accounted for
by our Author. The absurd Reasonings of Astrologers from these Signs;
as also their Inability to ac∣count for supposed Images in the Front or
Face of every Sign; with their want of Reason or Authority for culling out
only a certain number of fixed Stars as influential. <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s
allowing to the Planets ordinary Luck, but to the fixed Stars Happiness,
inconceivable. <HI>Bonatus</HI> his Shift a∣gainst the Objection drawn from
the Use of only a certain number of Stars, followed by the Reason why
Philosophers defined Chance and Fortune to be Causes not in themselves,
but by Accident. The Argument, That Events, which draw their Virtue rather from
the Means which happen by the way, than from the first Intent; from Fortune
than from Foresight; seem to be brought to pass by Chance al∣together, in
respect of us; objected to, by a Comparison <PB N="337" REF="366"/> which in
no wise holds, <HI>viz.</HI> That we may guess at the Course of Things by
poring on the Stars, as well as a Car∣penter at the Goodness of a Frame by
knowing the Timber. Wherefore all Knowledge from remotest Causes, as from
the Planets, is obscure. <HI>Plato,</HI> tho' nearest the Truth, when he
says, That all Planets are benevolent, is yet opposed by the Planetarians
to keep up their Scheme. No prescribing with certainty, where, upon one
Change, so many others follow; as in this Art. The Divisions of
Astrologers in their Fundamentals. Also a Question put to them, Whether,
touching Things which are perfected in Time, we should guess according to
the Minute wherein the Work is first conceived in our Thought, or when it is
begun, or when it is perfected; or when only part and not the whole is
finished. Some Opinions herein; with the Application of the Question: As
that, since the time of Conception is un∣certain, we must take our Aim by
that of the Birth, as the only Mark we have to guide us. <HI>Haly</HI>'s
Attempt to prove the time of Conception and Birth to be the same; with the
divers Accidents concurring before we can take the certain Minute of any Birth.
The absurd Reply of some hereto. Com∣monwealths also, as presumed to
have their Fates, the Ob∣ject of these Pretenders. They are question'd
again, whe∣ther they believe that Influence they talk of, univer∣sal; from
all the Heavens, or from the Planets only? Shew∣ing that it pinches them which
way soever they take it. And after observing, that the Angels know nothing
but as God has revealed it to them, concludes, we must be Fools in thinking
that any Thing can be discerned in an <HI>Ephemeris,</HI> which is but the
Device of Man. Here we en∣ter upon the Arguments to be drawn from Experience
upon this Subject; and after its Definition we have the Reasons why it will
make nothing in favour for astrological Divina∣tions. That from the Flights
of <HI>Birds</HI> and Bowels of <HI>Beasts</HI> Guesses and Inferences
were sometimes answered by Events, but not from the Influence of those
Things which were sup∣posed to be the Causes. Thus tho' a War should
follow an <HI>Eclipse,</HI> we may find a more real and rational Cause.
Next we have an Examination of the dreaded Events of <HI>Comets.</HI> How
divided the Opinions of the Ancients about them. The Objection drawn from
Experience, of <HI>Comets</HI> that have brought forth one Effect, answered.
That nothing can be predicted from them, because of their Inconstancy in
time and place of Appearance, Motion, Figure, Continuance, 
<PB N="338" REF="367"/> Qualities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Arguments for their
denoting the Deaths of Princes disproved in every Branch. That they have died
oftner after the glaring of a Rainbow. That many great Princes here named, had
not their Deaths foretold by any Comets. Observations on the Plenty and
Prosperity that rather follow'd them; and Health, exemplify'd in Queen
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who never was in better State of Body than during the
twenty five Years of her Reign, in which many Comets appear'd. And here our
Author affirms, as an Eye-Witness, 
<Q REND="inline">"That when divers scrupulously dissuaded
her Ma∣jesty at <HI>Richmond</HI> from looking at the Comet which ap∣peared
last (in 1572) with a Courage answerable to the greatness of her State,
she caused the Window to be set open, and cast out these Words,
<HI>Jacta est alea; The Dice are thrown:</HI> Affirming that <HI>her
stedfast Hope and Confi∣dence was too firmly planted in the Providence of
God, to be blasted or affrighted with those Beams, which either had a
Ground in Nature whereon to rise, or at least no Warrant in Scripture to
portend the Mishaps of Prin∣ces.</HI> Behold a Woman, and a Queen, which
seem to be the Kinds and Callings, upon which the Comets, if A∣strologers
speak Truth, are wont to prey; and yet she not only relenteth not to common
Fear, but insulteth rather upon common Folly! Then we have a fine Compliment
paid to her Majesty for her numerous Virtues, which might make her an
Exception to the common Rule; because <HI>Wisdom governs the
Stars.</HI>"</Q> Next we have the Fancies of those who ascribe the Cause
of Earthquakes to Planets, condemned; with an Answer to the Demand why we may
not as lawfully seek out the Properties of Stars as of Stones, Metals,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Shewing, that to search for that in the Sky which may be
found nearer hand, is repugnant to Philosophy. And because some
countenance their Preten∣sions by <HI>Astronomy,</HI> 'tis here
distinguish'd what Parts of Na∣ture this Science considers, and in what
Manner the Rules or Propositions of any Art should be lawful, true and
agree∣able to Nature, which cannot be found in Astrology. Ar∣guments taken
from Physick, Physiognomy, and Naviga∣tion to prove it an Art of no avail.
Against the Assertion that it is impossible to gather any certain
Knowledge of Things which are brought forth by the Concourse of divers
disunited Accidents; 'tis affirm'd by the other side, Poverty, Sickness,
Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should rather bear the Name of Ad∣herents than of
Accidents, forasmuch as they claeve to <PB N="339" REF="368"/> the Subject,
having a certain Foundation or Ground at the Bottom of our Natures; and the
falsity of this Affirmation exposed. Did Planets convey such Qualities
and Influences as are pretended? then must they work the like Effects on
Beasts. No Credit to the Art, that <HI>Aristotle</HI> affirms, these
lower Parts or Earth do confine upon the higher; nor that Persons inhabiting
under the Meridian are exceeding timo∣rous, effeminate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor
lastly, what <HI>Melanchton</HI> affirms, That Children which are born in the
eighth Month never live. The Doctrine of Inundations, Plagues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
proceed∣ing from the Contagion of the Air; the Air receiving this Contagion
from the Planets, and the Planets being the Causes of our Misery,
consider'd and answer'd, by a parallel Case of the Heart in Man.
<HI>Haly</HI>'s Instance also of Floods, and parching Heats from Planets,
being some cold, others hot, excepted to. With the Author's Advice to
well-disposed Wits, to direct their Enquiries only to Things that may be
known.</P>
<P>Chap. V. <HI>Of Conference with Familiars or damned Spirits.</HI>
Herein is set down, the belief of some, That there neither is certain Hell,
nor shall be Spirits till the latter Day: How∣ever, the Existence of
Spirits argu'd for. To dispute about the Manner or Mean, where the
Messenger is wicked, or the Message false, wou'd be needless. The
Means where∣by Spirits may be thought to guess at Things future, pro∣posed
in several Instances. That the Illusions of <HI>Sedechias</HI> the
deceitful <HI>Jew,</HI> presented before <HI>Lewis</HI> the Emperor; and of
others, ought not to seem strange, since the Works of God are far more
deep: And since <HI>Scotto</HI> the <HI>Italian</HI> Jug∣ger could play
such Slights before Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that those who undertook to
discry them were no less beguiled than the rest, who presumed less
upon their own Penetra∣tion, 'tis thought we may deem Familiars to be more fine
and nimble. Further, of these incorporeal Messengers, as the
<HI>Demon</HI> of <HI>Socrates,</HI> the Spirit that daily called upon
<HI>A∣laricus,</HI> and that named <HI>Orthon,</HI> which brought Intelligence
from all Corners of the World to <HI>Gaston</HI> Earl of <HI>Foix,</HI> as
<HI>Froissart</HI> has at large (and perhaps too largely) related. Some
Arguments in defence of Familiars, and wicked Spi∣rits, consider'd, and
refuted: But the Abettors of this Art being at a Nonplus for want of Reasons
to defend the same, appeal to the pretended Apparition of <HI>Samuel</HI>;
and tell us that as the Sorceress called him up, so surely may the
Con∣jurers of these Times invoke the Souls of godly Men. But 
<PB N="340" REF="369"/> our Author denies that it was the real <HI>Samuel.</HI>
If it be urg∣ed, Why are Conjurers sometimes so desirous of a dead Hand,
as <HI>Athanasius</HI> was accused to have cut off that of
<HI>Arsenius</HI> to abuse with magical Practices; or that a Hair, a Pin,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is desired by wicked Spirits and Witches, of the Parties
they would have Power over? 'Tis answer'd, the Gift is naked and impotent,
unless vested with Consent: The Hand no more able to sway the Soul,
than the Fore∣castle of a Ship to guide the Stern; that the Belief is rather
craved than the Benevolence; the Heart than the Hand; the Trust than the
Token. That the Souls of Men indeed sleep not after death, but Bodies do; and
shall not be awak∣ed before the Knell which rings all in to Condemnation or
Paradise: Wherefore he concludes, That neither Souls nor Bodies can appear to
Conjurers but by a Figure or Sha∣dow of Illusion, so far as it may take a
seeming Colour by the Practice of our Enemy; and shews how unlikely it is
in the Case of <HI>Samuel,</HI> That either God should suffer a Pro∣phet
of his own chusing to turn Deceiver, as <HI>Samuel</HI> cer∣tainly had been,
had he deliver'd himself to <HI>Saul</HI> in such Terms as the Spirit did,
or that the Devil by his nicest Art could restore a Body to its former
Shape, which was long before this dissolved to Dust and Ashes.</P>
<P>Chap. VI. <HI>Of the Cabalistick Art.</HI> Its Antiquity,
Mean∣ing, and why so called. The two Species thereof defined. From these
Definitions hardly conceivable, how this Art can afford either Help or Credit
to the Prophet. Here we have an Account of the Conference held by our noble
Au∣thor, six Years before, with one <HI>Brocado</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> then in
the Court, who was a Pretender to this whimsical Art of expounding the
Scriptures; and from thence took upon him to divine what Fortune should
betide the <HI>Low Coun∣tries,</HI> as he said he had foretold what should
befall <HI>Paris,</HI> at least five Years before the Massacre fell out.
But our Author, among other Arguments, told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That Ex∣amples which fell out by Chance, were
never current where the Cause was to be justified by Reason: And
therefore, till he could as readily product a certain Ground to make his
Guesses good, as score up a Register of blind Events, I must (says
he) rather praise his Luck than his Learning; for as well might he
prognosticate that the <HI>Cock-pit</HI> in <HI>Shoe-lane</HI> should
sink on the third of <HI>June,</HI> because a Theatre fell down about that
time at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Claudius</HI>; as that either
<HI>Antwerp</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI> <PB N="341" REF="370"/> should be plagued
by the Pattern of <HI>Edom</HI> or <HI>Samaria.</HI> We may be generally taught
by the Precedents of God's righteous Judgments upon former States, that
whosoever sins or transgresses against either Table of the Moral
Law, should either be corrected by his Justice, or for∣borne by his Mercy;
but by whether of these Means God purposeth to cure the Carbuncle of Man's
Iniquity is concealed from our Knowledge, and therefore were it vain to guess
what his Pleasure is to execute. The safest Course is to suspect
the worst, because Extremities are due; but yet we cannot determine and
resolve of nei∣ther."</Q></P>
<P>Chap. VII. <HI>Of the Scripture Authorities for
Prognostication.</HI> Shewing how, in several Instances, it is there
prohibited. The falsity of the Assertion made by the Pretenders to
these Arts, That they never make Enquiries into any thing unlawful. The
<HI>High German</HI>'s Proof of the Certainty of Star-Divinity, in the Warning
given to Frier <HI>Savanorola,</HI> by <HI>Bellantius</HI> the Astrologer,
exposed; evidencing how vain and ineffectual such Warnings are; since
what is de∣creed by Destiny, cannot be prevented by Intelligence. Then the
Enquiry is made, Whether the Warning that this Frier should be put out of the
way for Heresy were true or not? If he affirm it to be true, then must he
grant that Doctrine to be Heresy which himself and his Country main∣tain
against <HI>Rome: That the Pope's Pardons are of no Ef∣fect. That he abuses
his Authority,</HI> &amp;c. For these were the Matters in defence whereof
<HI>Savanorola</HI> died: If he deny these Articles to deserve the Name or
Note of Heresy, which either he must do or confess himself a Heretick;
then it is evident that <HI>Bellantius</HI> was very much beguiled in
be∣lieving or advertising that <HI>Savanorola</HI> should be swept away
for ungodly Doctrine. The Case is passing hard, which drives a Man either
to renounce his Faith, or to forsake his Fancy. Were there a Register among
the Stars, we need∣ed not to seek the Scripture for our Order, but the
Planets for our Fortune. In the Moderns, to say, they regard the Stars, as
Means only, by which God brings his Decrees to pass, and so ought not to be
set upon a Level with the An∣cients, who look'd upon them as Gods; will not
serve, and wherefore. Observations on the two next Centuries after
<HI>Christ</HI> being rifest with Miracles, as the Air is warmest at the
setting of the Sun, and the People apter to believe the Gifts and Doctrine of
Miracles, the fresher their Sufferings <PB N="342" REF="371"/> were who
propagated them. The Antiquity of <HI>Astrology</HI> examined, with its
Derivation. The Singularity of <HI>Porphiry;</HI> who alone of all the
Philosophers gave into it. And the vain Assertion of <HI>Melanchton,</HI>
That <HI>Moses, Essay, &amp;c.</HI> impugn not all kind of Divination,
but rather the Pride of Man, in presuming to understand those Secrets
which are reserved to God alone, as the <HI>Last-Day,</HI> &amp;c. The
Objections drawn from Scripture, as <HI>Moses</HI> being learned in the
Mysteries of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and from these Words, <HI>Mine Hour is not yet
come,</HI> &amp;c. and from the Star which conducted the wise Men at the
Birth of <HI>Christ</HI>; consider'd, and answer'd. <HI>Cardan</HI>'s
Er∣ror in assigning the Hour of that Birth; with the foolish reasoning
of him, and others, from the Face of the Heavens at that time. The Knowledge of
<HI>Seth, Abraham, &amp;c.</HI> urged in vain, since their Remarks of the
heavenly Orbs tended to the Knowledge of their Courses, Eclipses, &amp;c.
for the Distinction of Times and Seasons, so needful in the Observance
of their religious Feasts and Ceremonies: Wherefore some have gather'd from
certain Expressions in Scripture, That the Tribe of <HI>Issachar</HI>
was bound by Order, to the Study of the Stars; as divers Colleges in
<HI>Cambridge</HI> are enjoin'd by the Statutes of the Founders, to give
Allow∣ance to certain Persons for this End.</P>
<P>The Remainder of the Volume is a Collection of Argu∣ments,
Authorities, and Histories further detecting the De∣lusions of these
pretended Prophets, and their Ambition in all times, of supplanting what is
certain in God's Providence by what is probable in Man's Conjecture. Their
Subtilty herein further laid open. Their little Arts, Shifts, and
E∣quivocations to gain themselves Profit and Honour, where they happen to be
lucky in their Predictions; and shelter or subterfuge, where they answer
not what they had raised the Apprehensions of Mankind to expect; with
abundance of Examples to prove how justly such presumptuous Impos∣tures
deserve the Detestation of all sober and ingenuous Men; as conducing to
the Miscarriage of so many Under∣takings, which have depended on their
Authority. Also pointing out the various Means of discerning such
Counter∣feits; which by how much more successfully they have de∣luded the
Generality in all Ages past, should so much more effectually arm the
Future with Precaution. Among these Examples in this concluding Part, we
cannot be here fur∣ther particular than to mention those of
<HI>Manfredus</HI> the A∣strologer, who promised an <HI>Italian</HI> Prince
many Years Life, <PB N="343" REF="372"/> and that he himself should live to
discover many Wonders by his Art, but died in the approaching Spring before
he could declare them. The Experiment of the Earl of <HI>Arun∣del,</HI> who
would note in his Almanacks, the Changes of the Weather, every where contrary
to what had been asserted by the Writers of them; and found his own
Predictions oftner true than theirs. The Persages of Dearth in 1558 confuted,
by its proving a plentiful Year. The Disappoint∣ment of the <HI>Abbot</HI>
who built him a House on <HI>Harrow-Hill,</HI> to secure him from the
threatned Deluge, when it proved a Year of great Drought. The Delusions, by
Figures and Images, in the old painted Manuscripts, and in the Herald's
Books, and those pretended to be preserved in religious Houses; as
<HI>Merlin</HI>'s Prophecies, which were chain'd to the Desks in many
Libraries. The Use made of Women in these prophetick Cozenages: Thus
<HI>Montanus</HI> wrought by <HI>Maximilla,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> by their
<HI>Pucelle de Dieu,</HI> and our <HI>English</HI> Anabaptists by their
<HI>Holy Maid of</HI> Kent. The vain Presumption of <HI>Verdungus</HI> a
Prophet in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. Instances of the Ruin of
several Princes by adhering to the Advice of Magicians, Astrologers, and
Pro∣phets. Other late Instances of some learned <HI>English</HI> Men
deluded thereby: How <HI>Bellantius,</HI> who predicted <HI>Savano∣rola</HI>'s
Execution, could not foresee his own. When Car∣dinal <HI>Wolsey</HI>
superstitiously avoided <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> tho'
his ready Way from <HI>Asher</HI> to the Court, for a quibbling Prophecy,
that <HI>Kingston should be his End:</HI> Was it not a ly∣ing Prophecy? For
even Sir <HI>Anthony Kingston,</HI> to whose Custody the Cardinal was
committed, proved not his End, nor brought him to the Tower, as he was charged;
for he died of his Illness at <HI>Leicester.</HI> And the Rood of
<HI>Darvill Gathren,</HI> how did it burn a <HI>Forrest,</HI> according to
the <HI>Welsh</HI> Prophecy that it should? When in scorn to
superstition, the Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> burnt a Fryer with that Image. But
we might quote half the Book to mention the Examples of this kind, wherewith it
is all over so elaborately embellish'd; which would have been much easier
commanded, had it been furnished with a <HI>Table</HI> or <HI>Index,</HI>
whereof the second Edition in Fol. 1620. is also deficient; but we hope it
will be supply'd therewith, if ever this Work arrives at a Third.</P>

<HI>of</HI> FUNERAL MONUMENTS, &amp;c. <HI>by</HI> JOHN WEEVER. Fol. 1631.
Pages 770. besides Preface, Index, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS Collection of Antiquities is adorn'd with a neat
Frontispiece, representing the Figures of Death and the Resurrection:
Also with another Sculpture of the Author, in a laced Cap, with his Hand on a
Skull; round the same there is an Inscription in <HI>Latin,</HI> shewing
that he was fifty five Years of Age at this time that the said Work was
publish'd; and at the bottom, four <HI>English</HI> Verses, informing us
he was born in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and educated in the University of
<HI>Cambridge:</HI> Both which Prints were engraved by <HI>Thomas
Cecil.</HI></P>
<P>The Work is inscribed by the Author to King <HI>Charles</HI>;
and in his Preface or Epistle to the Reader we find he had not only
observed what Honour Foreign Nations had re∣ceived by thus putting into print
their monumental Antiqui∣ties, but that he had with painful Expences travell'd
over most Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and some Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> to
collect the Funeral Inscriptions of all the Cathedral and Parochial Churches:
But being much discouraged to proceed by the many malignant and avaricious
Defacements he beheld of those venerable Remains, and the many Obstructions
and Troubles he met with from petulent Officers and Church∣wardens for want of
a Commission, he had Thoughts of burying all in silence, till he was
animated afresh, to pub∣lish <PB N="345" REF="374"/> what he had thus
gather'd, by <HI>Augustus Vincent</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Windsor</HI>
Herald and Keeper of the Records in the Tower; Sir <HI>Robert Cotton,</HI>
newly dead, on whom we have here a <HI>La∣tin</HI> Elegy set forth; Sir
<HI>H. Spelman,</HI> Sir <HI>Simon D'Ewes, John Selden</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
besides Sir <HI>Richard</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry St. George, John Philpot</HI>
and <HI>W. Le Neve</HI> Esqrs. From all whom he had Assistance, which
encouraged him thus to finish this first Part; and to compleat the rest
of the Work, now in good forwardness, he intreats the Communications of the
Publick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But the Reason why we had not the Author's
said Continua∣tion of this Work, was, that he died the next Year after this
first Part was printed, as <HI>Anthony Wood</HI> informs us.</NOTE>. The
remainder of this Epistle contains Advice to the Tomb-makers; that they would
be careful to pre∣serve the Inscriptions which they engrave; with some
Apo∣logies for extolling the ardent Piety of our Forefathers in these their
Ecclesiastical Liberalities; and for the Method he has pursued; his
Punctuality in following the ancient Ortho∣graphy; and the Possibility of
some Errors which may have escaped, thro' his having had the Helps and
Collections of many; and others, thro' the common Fate of the Press; whereof
the greatest he had met with he has amended<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">But there are yet left several, which are very material;
especially in the <HI>Numerical</HI> Letters and Figures of the said
Inscriptions, which are, as to those Particulars, often erroneous, as Mr.
<HI>Wharton</HI> in <HI>Angl. Sacra,</HI> Part I. Page 668 has observed:
Whether chargeable upon our Author's own Transcripts, or those of his
Friends, tho' not distinguishable, so as to fix the Imputation of
Ignorance or Negligence upon him; yet, be the Defect in one, or the other, the
<HI>Chronological</HI> Readers are e∣qually liable to be misled: To apprise
those Readers whereof, was one Reason for our present Review of this
Book; as another Reason is, to oblige <HI>historical</HI> Readers with the
Notice of many eminent Persons characterised therein, from ancient and
credible Authorities.</NOTE>. So concludes with a Distich from
<HI>Chytraeus,</HI> warning us, from the Funerals of so many others in one
Book, to con∣sider the Certainty of our own.</P>
<P>Then follows <HI>The Discourse of Funeral Monuments,</HI>

<P><PB N="348" REF="377"/>In the next Page begins his Collection, with
the <HI>Funeral Monuments in the Diocesse of</HI> CANTERBURY. And here,

four of the King's Guard on the 28th of <HI>Dec.</HI> 1170. and of whose
Life, Death, Sepul∣ture, Shrine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we have here a Narrative in

others interr'd in the other Churches in <HI>Canterbury</HI>; and likewise of
the Foundations of the religious Houses there. Here we have King
<HI>Ethelbert</HI>'s Charter, for the Foundation of the Monastery of St.

thereon. In <HI>Seving∣ton,</HI> of the <HI>Barrys</HI> and the
<HI>Finches.</HI> Here ends the Account of Burials and Inscriptions in this
Diocesse, which is follow∣ed with a Narrative of the Archbishops of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> who were canonized Saints; beginning with St.
<HI>Austin,</HI> and the fabulous Legend of the Judgment upon the Natives of
a Town in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> who disregarding his Doctrine were born
with Fishes Tails, as written by <HI>Alex. Esseby</HI>; and those of
<HI>Strode</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> for a Contempt of <HI>Tho. Becket</HI> and
his Horse, in cutting off his Tail, born with Tails of Horses or other
Beasts, according to the foolish Assertion of <HI>Pol. Virgil.</HI>
These Archbishops thus canonized, of whom we have here a short History
or Character, are thirteen in number, ending with St. <HI>Edmund,</HI> who died
1242. And this Part concludes at Page 307, with some Observations upon the
Enlargement of the Archbishoprick, and the Con∣tentions between
<HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York</HI> for the Primacy. Hence we pass to</P>
<P><HI>Ancient Funeral Monuments within the Diocesse of</HI>
RO∣CHESTER. 
<Q REND="inline">"This Bishoprick, says our Author, is so
over∣shadowed by the nearness and greatness of the See of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> that it looks but like a good Benefice for one of his
Grace's Chaplains; yet for Antiquity and Dignity of a long Succession of
Reverend Lord Bishops, it may equally compare with its Neighbour of
<HI>Canterbury.</HI>"</Q> For they had both one Founder, <HI>Ethelbert</HI>
King of <HI>Kent</HI>; who built this Church to the Honour of St.
<HI>Andrew,</HI> and endowed it; whereof <HI>Justus</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> was
consecrated Bishop by St. <HI>Augustine.</HI> Here follows a short
Description <PB N="351" REF="380"/> of the City; the Limits of the
Diocesse, and the four Dea∣neries it consists of: The Valuation in the
Exchequer; First-fruits, and <HI>Peter</HI>-Pence: That eighty one Bishops
(more by nine than in <HI>Canterbury</HI>) have sate in the Chair of
<HI>Rochester;</HI> and the present Bishop is Dr. <HI>John Bowles</HI>;
but more particularly of the three first Successors of <HI>Justus,</HI>
named <HI>Paulinus, Gundulphus,</HI> and <HI>Gilbertus,</HI> who were bu∣ried
here, tho' no Monuments remain of them. Then we come to <HI>Walter de
Merton</HI> Bishop of this See, who founded <HI>Merton</HI> College in
<HI>Oxford</HI>; whose Monument here was re∣newed by Sir <HI>Henry
Savile</HI> Warden of that College; and by the Inscription thereon, it
appears the said Bishop died 1277. After three Bishops more, here
mention'd, our Au∣thor observes, That he finds no more of this Diocesse
to have been buried in this Cathedral Church; because com∣monly they were
removed to another See, before they were translated to another Life, this
Preferment being only a Step to a higher: Therefore after a Word or two of St.
<HI>William</HI> the Baker and Martyr, here inshrined from
<HI>Cap∣grave;</HI> and the like of the Priory, our Author proceeds to other
Churches, the rest of the Funeral Monuments in this, being of later Times;
which he reserves for another Vo∣lume. At <HI>Ailesford,</HI> we have an
Account of the Interment of <HI>Catigern</HI> the Brother of King
<HI>Vortimer,</HI> and <HI>Horsa</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> who kill'd each
other in a pitch'd Battle. In <HI>Otte∣ham,</HI> the Foundation of the Abbey
there; and also of <HI>Beg∣ham</HI> Priory; with some Account of the
<HI>Sackviles,</HI> and also of Sir <HI>Robert Turnham,</HI> from
<HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Gloucester.</HI> In <HI>Pensherst,</HI> the
Monument of Sir <HI>Stephen Pensherst</HI>; with the Copy of a Record from
the Tower concerning him, dated the first of King <HI>Edward</HI> I. Here
also is mention made of the renowned Family of the <HI>Sidneys,</HI> buried
in this Place, more particularly Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> and his elder Bro∣ther
Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> who was shot before <HI>Zutphen</HI> in
<HI>Gelderland</HI> the 22d of <HI>September,</HI> died at <HI>Arnheim</HI> the
16th of <HI>October</HI> 1586, and was buried most magnificently at St.
<HI>Paul's</HI> Cathedral, <HI>London,</HI> the 16th of <HI>February</HI>
following: And here we have his Epitaph, imitated from that com∣posed by
<HI>Isaac du Bellay</HI> in memory of the <HI>Sieur de Bonivet,</HI> and
some Elegies made upon him both in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English</HI> by
King <HI>James.</HI> In <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> we have some Account of the Lord
<HI>Staffords</HI>; the <HI>Clares</HI> and <HI>Audleys</HI> Earls of
<HI>Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Jud</HI> Founder of the Free-School here.
In <HI>Sevenoke,</HI> an Account of the poor Foundling there named 
<PB N="352" REF="381"/> <HI>William Sevenoke,</HI> who, in 1418, was Lord Mayor
of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and then built a Hospital and a Free-School in the
said Town where he was found. In <HI>Chidingston,</HI> of the
<HI>Wil∣loughbys.</HI> In <HI>Cobham</HI> and in <HI>Shorne,</HI> the ancient
Family of the <HI>Cobhams</HI>; the <HI>Braybrokes</HI> and <HI>Brooks</HI>;

for a portable Altar, and a Mass-Priest. Election of their Priest and
Con∣fessor. The Form of an Absolution. The Definition of a
<HI>Merchant.</HI> What <HI>Pedlars</HI> are; and what the <HI>Staple.</HI> In
<HI>Chetham,</HI> a Narrative of a strange Burial by priestly Delu∣sion
in this Church-yard, as related by <HI>Lambard</HI> in his
<HI>Perambulation</HI> of <HI>Kent.</HI> In <HI>Otford,</HI> an Account of
some Battles anciently fought by <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> there;
where <HI>Alrick</HI> the last King of <HI>Kent</HI> was slain: Also of
St. <HI>Bartil∣mew</HI> a good Purveyor of Poultry for the Parson of the
Town; all the Women therein who desir'd to have Male Children, offering him a
Cock-chicken, and all who covet∣ed Females, a Hen. Likewise of the Worship
paid to St. <HI>Tho. Becket</HI> in this Town; and the Miracles he wrought
here; as the springing a Well out of dry Ground; enjoin∣ing no Nightingale to
sing thereabout, because one had disturbed him in his Prayers; which is
as true doubtless as that other pious Prohibition of any Smith to thrive in
the Parish, because one had prick'd his Horse in shoeing. Here, from
the Victories of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Men over the <HI>Danes</HI> in
<HI>Holmes Dale,</HI> and the many brave Warriors interr'd there, our Author
takes occasion to conclude this Part with some general Characters of this
flourishing County of <HI>Kent,</HI> be∣ginning with <HI>Michael
Drayton</HI>'s Encomium, and Mr. <HI>Sel∣den</HI>'s Notes upon the Place;
concerning their throwing off the <HI>Norman</HI> Yoke; with <HI>John</HI> of
<HI>Salisbury</HI>'s Testimo∣ny, That <HI>Kentish</HI> Men had to his Time
the Prerogative of the Vantguard in the Wars. More particularly of the Gentry
and Yeomanry of <HI>Kent</HI>; which with several In∣stances of their
Privileges and Prerogatives; together with the Courage and Happiness of the
Church in up∣holding <PB N="353" REF="382"/> her Rights against the Monks, and
even Arch∣bishops, and maintaining her Chair immoveably in this one Place,
brings us, at Page 349, to an End of the Observa∣tions upon this little See
of <HI>Rochester.</HI> The next is</P>
<P><HI>Ancient Funeral Monuments within the Diocesse of</HI>
LON∣DON. These are introduced with several Commendations of this famous
Metropolis in Verse and Prose, by <HI>John Johnston,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert
Dallington, Speed, Robert</HI> of <HI>Gloucester, Camden, Adrian Junius, W.
Warner,</HI> and <HI>Robert Fabian.</HI> So we enter into St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
Cathedral, founded by King <HI>Ethelbert</HI>; and here we have his Charter,
with the Dona∣tions and Confirmations of his Royal Successors, and other
Benefactors. The present Government, Extent, and Value of the Bishoprick.
Whence we proceed to the Monu∣ments; beginning with King <HI>Sebba</HI>'s, so
pass to other <HI>Saxon</HI> Princes, and several Bishops of
<HI>London,</HI> who were here in∣terr'd, particularly, that <HI>William,</HI>a
<HI>Norman,</HI> who was Bishop of this Diocesse at the Conquest, and
who obtain∣ed of <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> a Grant to this City,
of Li∣berties in as ample a Manner, as it enjoy'd them under <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the <HI>Confessor:</HI> Which in our modern <HI>English</HI> runs thus,

died 1360, whose Tomb by the Ignorant, has been called Duke
<HI>Humphrey</HI>'s, but who indeed had none here, he being buried at St.
<HI>Albans</HI>; however, upon that fond Conceit, some Men would, latterly,
have Meetings here on St. <HI>An∣drew</HI>'s-Day, says <HI>Stow,</HI> and
conclude on a Breakfast or Dinner, as assuming themselves to be
Servants, or to hold diversity of Offices under the said Duke
<HI>Humphrey.</HI> Here we have also <HI>Margaret</HI> the second Wife of
<HI>John Talbot,</HI> the renowned Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI>; who died in
<HI>June</HI> 1468. And because in our Annals, <HI>Brute</HI> is reported to
have been buried in this City, of his own Foundation, we have here his Story
recorded, as it is generally received. Then fol∣lows an Account of some
<HI>Jews</HI> in this City, who crucified <HI>English</HI> Children in
derision of our Saviour and his Suffer∣ings on the Cross. An Account of the
Cloyster of <HI>Pardon</HI> Church-yard, on the north Side of the Cathedral,
where the finest Monuments were erected, and round the Walls of which was
artfully painted the celebrated Dance of <HI>Paul</HI>'s, or <HI>Death</HI>'s
<HI>Dance,</HI> being the Picture of Death, leading forth all Degrees of Men.
With an Account of the demolishing the Chappel in that Yard, founded by
<HI>Tho. Becket</HI>'s Father, and other adjacent Chappels and Monuments in St.
<HI>Pauls,</HI> by <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset.</HI> Some further
mention of Sir <HI>John Poultney</HI> and his Benefactions. And of several
Shrines in honour of Holy Persons buried here. Also the Dimensions of the
Cathedral or Edifice itself, and Altitude, being 534 Foot high from the
Ground, before it was fired with Lightning in 1087. With a Comparison between

Succession of Bishops in this See of <HI>London,</HI> they were 89 in
number, Bishop <HI>Laud</HI> governing the same at this time. And these
Remarks upon this Church concludes with an Account of the <HI>Cardinals</HI>
thereof. So we move on to St. <HI>Faiths,</HI> St. <HI>Martins, Ludgate,
Christ-Church, Black-Fryars,</HI> and the rest of the Parishes, giving an
Account of their Religious Foundations, the Interments, and ancient
In∣scriptions in them; of which we cannot be further expres∣sive than to

<HI>Westminster.</HI> And here, as the Foundation thereof with the ancient
Monuments have since been more publickly historized, we shall only name
those eminent Persons, with the Dates of their Death, who are most

Chaucer,</HI> 1400. (but falsly, as may ap∣pear below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> in his <HI>Worthies of</HI> England, has
rightly observ'd (tho' he gives us no Authority for it) That <HI>Chaucer</HI>
was living in 1402. for in that Year I find he wrote and dated one of his Poems
entitled, <HI>The Letter of Cupid.</HI> However Mr. <HI>Brigham,</HI> by his
Date upon the Monument he erected in honour of this Poet at
<HI>Westminster, Anno</HI> 1555. puts a Period to his Life even two Years
before that Date of <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s; in which Error many others besides
our Author have implicitly follow'd him.</NOTE>.) With several Characters of
him, as collected in the Narrative of his Life, before an old Edition of his
Works, by <HI>Tho. Speght.</HI> After which, our Author concludes 
<PB N="357" REF="386"/> his Account of the Monuments in this Abbey, with
<HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the <HI>Confessor</HI>'s Charter of <HI>Sanctuary,</HI>
and a Memento for Mortality, in Verse. Then follow some short Accounts of
certain Chappels, Hospitals, and other Religious Founda∣tions which were
adjacent, or in distant Parts of the City, and seem to have been before
omitted. Among these are <HI>the Chappel of our Lady in the Piew</HI>; which,
with the I∣mage of our Lady richly deck'd, was burnt to Ashes; and re-edified
by <HI>Anthony Wideville</HI> Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> &amp;c. who was unjustly

Concluding with a List of the Ser∣vices done by the said <HI>Cromwell</HI>
to King <HI>Henry,</HI> from the <HI>Autograph</HI> in the <HI>Exchequer.</HI>
Then we have some Account of Queen <HI>Anne Bullein,</HI> and Queen

in the Fields about <HI>London</HI>; especially certain <HI>British</HI>
Kings. The uncertain Burial of the young Princes <HI>Edward</HI> and
<HI>Richard,</HI> murdered 1483. Then we come to the Towns about

More;</HI> with his Inscription. In <HI>Kensington,</HI> an Explanation of
the <HI>Re∣membrancer</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> on occasion of one buried there

Incontinence of the Nuns and Friers there. In <HI>Hackney,</HI> an Explanation

Monument of <HI>Christopher Urswick</HI> the King's Almoner, who died 1521,
much praised for refusing so many Ecclesiastical Preferments, and
con∣tenting himself with a private Parsonage: Therefore thought an Example
for all our great Prelates to admire, and for few or none to imitate, says
our Author. After a few an∣cient <PB N="358" REF="387"/> Inscriptions more in
four or five other Parish Churches about <HI>London,</HI> we come to those
in HERTFORDSHIRE, the Ec∣clesiastical Government of some Part thereof
belonging to this Diocesse of <HI>London,</HI> as the rest, to that of
<HI>Lincoln:</HI> But because this is so large, our Author is so free as
to bor∣row the Inscriptions which belong to that Diocesse, and print them
with those which are properly for <HI>London.</HI> Here the Interment of
several ancient Families is mention'd un∣der the respective Parishes of
this County; but none am∣ply commemorated till we arrive at St.
<HI>Albans,</HI> and there we have several Particulars, in Prose and
Verse, upon the Protomartyr of that Name; with the Foundation of the Ab∣bey.

<HI>Oxford,</HI> and this Abbey; the Epitaph pencil'd on the Wall near his

Whethamsted</HI> aforesaid; of whom, more copiously than of all the
rest, especially his Benefactions, Buildings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with

<HI>Latin</HI> for several religious Persons and others here interr'd, by

this County, and the Inscriptions in them till we come to <HI>Sopwell,</HI>
and some adja∣cent <PB N="359" REF="388"/> Spittles; near which, they have the
large Mannor of <HI>Gorombery,</HI> where the Lord Keeper Sir <HI>Nicholas

Cause of the Barons Wars: And for her Refusal to consent to him, she
was poison'd in an Egg, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1213. Her banished Father then
serv'd in the <HI>French</HI> Wars; where he so valiantly overthrew one of
his own Countrymen who had given a Challenge, that King <HI>John</HI> received

of the Antiquities of this Kingdom, as we have it from his own

translated to <HI>Ely</HI>; and the last mention'd is Dr. <HI>Francis
White,</HI> a learned Man, as his Works testify. But from describing the
Situation, Cir∣cuit, Commodities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of this Diocesse, as he
had done of <HI>London,</HI> our Author excuses himself, in that it had
been already exactly perform'd by Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> in his Book call'd
<HI>Icenia.</HI> And here ends this <HI>Collection</HI> of <HI>Funeral
Mo∣numents</HI> at Page 871, as it should have been printed in our Title of
this Book; which, because it has preserved a great many <HI>religious
Foundations,</HI> and many hundred <HI>ancient Families</HI> (as may appear by
the Index alone, at the End) has been, and will be a Work of great Use to
many suc∣ceeding Collectors of our Antiquities, and Writers of our History,
either local or personal, general or particular; notwithstanding some
Inaccuracies may have escaped in it, as was before observ'd, whereof other
Works are not ex∣empt, which adventure to revive such a Variety of an∣cient
Memorials.</P>

Contents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>AT the Beginning of this Edition (for the Book was first
published in Twelves, 1650, without any Figures or Prints, but one in the
Front, of divers distorted or dis∣guised <PB N="365" REF="394"/> Heads and
Faces) there is prefix'd a comely Sculp∣ture of the Author Dr. <HI>John
Bulwer,</HI> engraved by <HI>W. Faithorne</HI>; and likewise another Title of
the Book, not much differing from the true Title above, but seemingly added
by the Printer to advance the universal reading of the Author, being
entitled, <HI>A View of the People of the whole World,</HI> &amp;c. Next we
have a Device in <HI>Sculpture,</HI> representing the awful <HI>Tribunal</HI>
of <HI>Nature,</HI> by Commission from <HI>Heaven,</HI> trying the
<HI>artificial Changeling,</HI> or Miscreants of all <HI>Nations,</HI> for
the abuse of their Bodies; with a short Explanation. Then follows a
Specimen of the Author's Poetry, in an <HI>Anacephalaeosis</HI> or
Recapitulation of his Work, intimated by the Frontispiece; wherein he briefly
recounts the many Scoffs and Rapes made on the natural Form of the Human Body.
After this we have the Au∣thor's Dedication to his Friend <HI>Thomas
Diconson;</HI> and likewise several epistolary Poems, some in
<HI>Latin,</HI> and o∣thers in <HI>English,</HI> to the Author in honour of
his Perform∣ance; one of these is written by <HI>Francis Goldsmith,</HI>
ano∣by <HI>Adolet Hogeresa</HI> of <HI>High Cross.</HI> There is also a
Letter to the Author from <HI>R. Mason</HI> of the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI>
dis∣covering the Ground of all Man's Prevarications. Next follows a short
Hint of the Use of this Treatise; also an anonymous Piece of
<HI>Latin</HI> Poetry, called <HI>Diploma Apollinis,</HI> being a <HI>Bull</HI>
or <HI>Writ</HI> of <HI>Apollo</HI> for translating the Author to the
<HI>Celestial</HI> Orb. After, a List of near 300 Authors, Histori∣ans,
Physicians, Anatomists, Travellers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> referr'd to in this
Work, we come to the <HI>Introduction</HI>; which highly extols the native
Beauty and Excellency of the human Fabrick; shews the Impiety of varying from
Nature; and the de∣praved Figures introduced thereby; 
<Q REND="inline">"insomuch," says the Author, "that it may
seem the first Men only were made by God, but the rest were of Mens
Invention: And," continues he, "while we dispute in Schools, whether if it
were possible, it were lawful for Man to destroy any one Species of God's
Creatures, tho' but of <HI>Toads</HI> and <HI>Spiders</HI>; Because this were
a taking away one Link of God's Chain, one Note of his Harmony; we have taken
away the Jewel at that Chain."</Q> He then recommends my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s
Opinion of the Helps towards Beauty, and good Features, and reducing the
Blemishes of Persons to their natural State: And so introduces his
Work.</P>
<P>The Work itself is represented in 24 Scenes, and is all along
illustrated with wooden Prints, of the Forms and <PB N="366" REF="395"/>

Head,</HI> affected by divers Nations; as Sugar-loaf Heads, long and short

as it were in their Shoulders, as related, among other An∣tients, by St.
<HI>Augustine,</HI> who says he saw them, and re∣peated by Sir <HI>John
Mandevill,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh, Purchas,</HI> and others: Next, of
horned Nations; and here is instan∣ced the Tale of one <HI>Margaret Owen</HI>

<HI>Scene</HI> 12. Of <HI>Beards</HI> and <HI>Manhood</HI> about the

attempting the Improve∣ment of the Body by cleaving their Tongues; 
<Q REND="inline">"Yet this Device," the Author shews, "is
destructive of the Per∣fection of the Body, for <HI>Nature</HI> neither
abounds in super∣fluous Things, nor is defective in Necessaries; she
does nothing in vain, nor creates any thing diminished, unless hindred by
Matter; so that the Provision of <HI>Nature</HI> being doubled by a

the Bridle of the Tongue, and in what Case, and how it ought to be cut.
<HI>Scene</HI> 15. Of <PB N="368" REF="397"/> the <HI>Face</HI>; the just

Beauty of the Body were ever esteem'd to proceed from a Modesty of
Behaviour and a due Reverence towards God, towards Society, and to∣wards
ourselves."</Q> Of Persons born with many Arms, o∣thers without Arms,

offer'd him, swallow'd them down, and fed all his Life on Stones and Pebbles.

Decency of the Breasts, and several strange Monstrosities affected
there∣in; why shameful Parts; of Male-Nurses; the <HI>Amazonian</HI>
Amputations, and the needless Wish of <HI>Momus</HI> and Don
<HI>Alonso</HI> for a Casement in the Breast. <HI>Scene</HI> 20. Of
<HI>Af∣fectations</HI> about the <HI>Breasts</HI> and <HI>Waist</HI>; here
the Author in∣veighs most bitterly against our pernicious Custom of
swathing and lacing of Infants; shewing by many physical 
<PB N="369" REF="398"/> Arguments what innumerable Diseases ensue from it,
as Rickets, Consumptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then gives us the Fashions
of many Nations in this Particular; with the Cause of Crookedness; and how
Children unborn may be disfigured. <HI>Scene</HI> 21. Of the
<HI>Privy-Parts</HI>; seeing the Author could not have answer'd to Nature
his Silence on this Head; after a modest Apology he takes a View of these
Parts in order, first, to shew the Abuses of them, with several
national Deformities; secondly, to teach their natural Use, Honesty, and
Perfection, by the many grave and curious Observa∣tions he intersperses;
and first he speaks of Yard Balls and Rings, fix'd by many Nations on the
Fore-Skin to prevent Venery; of <HI>Semi-Eunuchs</HI> and <HI>Eunuchs</HI>; how

Women; with other strange Abuses of these Parts. <HI>Scene</HI> 22. Of
<HI>Tailed-Nations</HI> and <HI>Breech Gallantry</HI>; the Reason why Man has
no Tails; <HI>Kentish</HI> Long-Tails re∣corded in our Chronicles and by
divers <HI>Popish</HI> Authors, whereof <HI>Delrio</HI> gives this Account, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Thomas Becket</HI> Arch∣bishop of
<HI>Canterbury</HI> being in Disgrace with <HI>Henry</HI> II. and riding
through <HI>Stroud</HI> near <HI>Rochester,</HI> the Inhabitants to affront

a handsome Woman, let her be <HI>English</HI> to the Neck, <HI>French</HI>

<P>We have now gone thro' the 24 Chapters of this Treatise, upon
which it will be needless here to add any Panegyrick, since whoever has
read it, can't but be acquainted with the Author's Skill and Accuracy in the
Philosophy of the hu∣mane Fabrick, as well as his Wit and Humour in
censuring the depray'd and pragmatical Inventions of Men. We will therefore
take a View of his APPENDIX, <HI>exhibiting the</HI> PEDIGREE <HI>of the</HI>
ENGLISH GALLANT, which he thought proper to annex, (having first prosecuted
his principal Design) to answer the Expectation of the Publick, who thought
him necessarily engag'd to touch upon the Defor∣mity of Apparel, of which
almost every Scene afforded emergent Occasion; herein explaining the
Proverb, <HI>God makes, but the Taylor shapes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English,</HI> and the more civiliz'd Nations, had
hitherto in a great measure escaped his Sentences of <HI>Treason</HI>
against <HI>Nature,</HI> whereof many others were convicted; yet here they
must bear to have their affected Vanities laid before them; 
<Q REND="inline">"It were not impossible," says he, "to
prove, that there was never any Conceit so extravagant, that ever forced the
Rules of Nature; or Fashion so mad, which fell into the Imaginations of any
of these indicted Nations, that may not meet with some publick Fashion of
Apparel a∣mong us, and seem to be grounded upon the same pre∣tended
Reason."</Q> Our Sugar-Loaf Hats, he attributes to the same Conceit as the
Sugar-Loaf Heads of Foreign Na∣tions; our square Caps are owing to their
square Heads; our flat Caps to their flat Heads; our <HI>French</HI> Hoods
imitate the <HI>Unicorn-like Dress</HI> of Hair among the barbarous
<HI>In∣dians:</HI> He then shews the foreign Extraction of our Masks,
Painting, and Black-Patches, our Pendents and auricular Bravery; our
Pease-cod-bellied Doublets emulare the <HI>Gor∣dian</HI> and
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Fashion, and other <HI>Gorbellied</HI> Nations. The
slashing and pincking our Doublets, our Cod-Piece Fashion, and
Trunk-Hose have all their Semblances in <HI>Barbarian</HI> Nations; as
likewise our indecent Fashion of naked Breasts and Shoulders, our vain
and foolish Verdin∣gales <PB N="372" REF="401"/> (or Hoops:) Our affected long
Shoes, our broad Shoes (which in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time occasion'd a
Procla∣mation that no Man should wear his Shoes above six Inch∣ches
square at the Toes) and our high Shoes have all their Original from abroad.
The Vanity of disguising our Shapes is also farther exposed by some
poetical Quotations from <HI>Alex. Barclay</HI>'s Translation of the <HI>Ship
of Fools</HI>; and from an ingenious old Comedy in the Character of
<HI>Lupa.</HI> He then concludes the Appendix with this apt Recom∣mendation, 
<Q REND="inline">"That whoever will reduce Cloaths and Gar∣ments to
their true End, must fit them to the Service and Commodity of the Body,
whence dependeth their Original Grace, and Comeliness, which can no way
better be done than by cutting them according to the natural Shape and
Proportion of the Body; as we may probably imagine the Skin-Garments were,
wherewith the Lord <HI>God,</HI> who best knew their Shape, first cloath∣ed
the Nakedness of our <HI>first Parents.</HI>"</Q> And he shews that we
ought not to allow Fashions for their Rareness and Novelty, when Goodness
and Profit are not joined to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We think it not
improper to take Notice of a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of the Author's Works
subjoin'd to this Treatise; which are as follow: Works already published;
1. <HI>The natural Language of the Hand.</HI> 2. <HI>The Art of manual
Rhetorick.</HI> 3. <HI>The deaf and dumb Man's Friend.</HI> 4. <HI>A

Language of the Head, or the Notions of Physiognomy.</HI> 8. <HI>The Art of

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THUS has the <HI>British Librarian</HI> given a Specimen of his
Undertaking, to the Extent of one Volume, in a diligent Abstract of above
fifty of our Scarce, Useful, and Valuable Books. In the choice of them, tho'
here are some of considerable Valuation extracted; yet the high Price to
which many are advanced in the Shops, has been no Temptation for his making
that the Rule to prefer them. He has rather thought those which are most
<HI>useful,</HI> the most <HI>valuable</HI>; and such of them, as are
grown most <HI>scarce,</HI> most needful and deserving of this
Recommenda∣tion. Accordingly, 'tis not doubted but they will appear worthy of
it, by what is here advanced to the Reader's No∣tice from them; being all
fraught with much <HI>observable Matter,</HI> as may be easily perceived by
this Scheme, for compassing the readiest Knowledge and Command thereof,
which may have escaped the Notice or Memory of several, who are even
possessed of the Books themselves which contain it; and also give
Intelligence to others, of many remarkable <HI>Things, Places,</HI> and
<HI>Persons</HI> which they would never otherwise have known; no Work, of
the like size a∣mong us, having pointed out such a variety of those
Parti∣culars, or drawn into so close a compass, the Substance of so
much Reading. He might perhaps have been more amusing to some Readers, in
being more ample upon some parts of his Authors; by extracting Pages of
Controversies, or Paragraphs of the pretty Stories, surprizing
Passages, or eloquent Speeches in them; but as many <HI>Topicks</HI> in an
Author must be sacrificed to gratify a few Indulgences in this kind, and to
divert some, the Enquiries of abundance remain unsatis∣fy'd; the Plan has
been follow'd which was at first laid down, to make it a Work rather of
general <HI>Information,</HI> than particular <HI>Entertainment.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Books conducive to this Purpose, those for which
Gratitude here demands chiefly the Publication of our Thanks, are the
<HI>Manuscripts.</HI> Such in the first place, is that here call'd, Sir
<HI>Thomas Wriothesly's Collections</HI>; contain∣ing <PB N="374" REF="403"/>
the <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of the <HI>Knights of the
Garter,</HI> and <HI>Views</HI> of the ancient <HI>Ceremonies</HI> used in
<HI>Creating</HI> the <HI>Knights of the Bath,</HI> &amp;c. For that Sketch
which the <HI>Li∣brarian</HI> has here given the <HI>Publick</HI> of it, they
are both be∣holden to the Permission of his Grace the Duke of
<HI>Mon∣tagu,</HI> the noble Owner of that valuable Volume;and to some
Explanations thereof, which were also courteously imparted by <HI>John
Anstis</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Garter,</HI> Principal <HI>King of
Arms,</HI> whose extensive Knowlege in these Subjects, his own elaborate
Publications, in honour of both those Or∣ders, have sufficiently confirm'd.
Nor will it be thought a Repitition unnecessary, by grateful Minds, that
the <HI>Li∣brarian</HI> here renews his Acknowledgments to <HI>Nathaniel
Booth</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> for his repeated
Communica∣tions; having been favour'd not only with that curious
<HI>Mis∣cellany,</HI> containing many of the old Earl of <HI>Derby</HI>'s
Papers, which, in one of the foregoing Numbers is abridg'd; but others out of
his choice Collections, which may enrich some future Numbers, when
Opportunity shall permit the Con∣tents thereof to appear. Other Manuscripts
herein described, were partly the Collection of Mr. <HI>Charles Grimes,</HI>
late, also of <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> and in the Bookseller's
Possession for whom this Work is printed; except one ancient Relique of
the famous <HI>Wicklife,</HI> for the use of which, many Thanks are here
return'd to Mr. <HI>Joseph Ames,</HI> Member of the <HI>Society of
Antiquaries.</HI> The Author of this Work is moreover obliged to the Library of
this last worthy Preserver of An∣tiquities, as also to that of his
ingenious Friend Mr. <HI>Peter Thompson,</HI> for the use of several
<HI>printed Books</HI> which are more scarce than many Manuscripts;
particularly some, set forth by our first Printer in <HI>England</HI>;
and others, which will rise, among the Curious, in Value, as, by the
Depre∣dations of Accident, or Ignorance, they decrease in Num∣ber. We must
take some further Opportunity to express our Obligations to other Gentlemen
who have favour'd us with such like Litterary Curiosities; and to some
hundreds unknown, who have shewn a relish for the Usefulness of this
Performance, by encouraging the Sale of it.</P>
<P>There can be added nothing more for the Reader's fur∣ther
Convenience, to this general Table or <HI>Contents,</HI> but an Alphabetical
<HI>Index</HI> to it; as a Master-Key that will give immediate recourse to
those Topicks, in so many Volumes thus abstracted, which had been lock'd
up, or secreted from their Knowledge to whom they would have been useful. 
<PB N="375" REF="404"/> And as from those <HI>ancient Springs</HI> it is
hereby obvious to all Readers, what a <HI>new River</HI> of Intelligence is
conducted for their Benefit; so the Author (from the Example of o∣thers in
such-like Attempts) may be sure of that Satisfac∣tion which arises from
the Contemplation of having been instrumental to so much publick Good.
Those who know the nature of such Works, may think one Volume,
com∣prehending the principal Matters in such a Library of Books, and near one
half of them Folios, expeditiously publish∣ed within the Space of one Year:
But as, in <HI>Performan∣ces of this kind,</HI> the most industrious Part,
is that which is most invisible, and the Fatigue is accounted of, from the
small Quantity of Writing which appears, not the vast and unseen Mass
of Reading required therein; the Operation is apt to be thought dilatory, by
those who are unacquainted with the Labour of it. And for the same
Reason, that they convey the Mind to such multifarious Advantages of
Infor∣mation, their own Merits also are usually disregarded by the
Generality, who are unexperienc'd in the Execution, but enjoy the Advantages of
the Work. Like those who look down with Admiration, at the Cost and Pains
which are be∣stowed upon the curious Compartments into which a Piece of
Ground is divided, and the flow'ry Groups, the verdant Mazes, or the fragrant
Bowers wherewith it is adorn'd; yet overlook those artificial Mounts and
Terras Walks, which they are at that instant upon, which give them all that
Com∣mand over this Variety of Prospects, and are indeed, the most
expensive and laborious Ornaments in the Garden.</P>
<P>All we shall say more of our <HI>Librarian,</HI> is, If he is
pre∣vail'd on to proceed, in cultivating this Undertaking with∣out
Intermission, he will continue his utmost Pains to make it answer all
the Accommodations proposed from it: Or if thro' other Engagements it
should be suffer'd to lie fallow for a Season, 'tis in hopes of
increasing its Vigour, and making the Returns equivalent to the Toils
thereof.</P>
