<HEAD>THE Preface <HI>to the</HI> Reader; And Particularly to <HI>Mariners</HI> and other <HI>Seafaring-Men.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' God's Wonders are every where visible, and his Mercies no where hid from the Eyes of Man; yet more par∣ticularly are they Evident to <HI>Seafaring-Men,</HI> whose Business is in the Great Waters, and their Lives exposed more than others to Innu∣merable Hazards and Dangers, of <HI>Contend∣ing Winds</HI> and <HI>Seas, Rocks, Quick-sands,</HI> and <HI>Inhospitable Shores:</HI> These, as it were, carry their Lives in their Hands, and their best Security is wholly to rely on the Provi∣dence and Protection of him <HI>whose Power the Wind and the Waves obey:</HI> Seeing there is so small a Partition between them and Eternity, the Striking on a treacherous <HI>Rock,</HI> over which many times the Flatter∣ing Waves smoothly glide, gives them their.
<PB REF="4"/>Winding-sheet in a Rumpled Wave. Nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this all their Danger, the Springing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Plank, a Leak not to be found, nor sudden∣ly stopt, running on a Shoal, or the falling of a Water-spout, frequently carry with them the same Inevitable Fate, and often makes them at their Wits End before they en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Lives; for a certain Prospect of Una∣voidable Death must needs be Terrible to Flesh and Blood, and, in a great measure, remove that Constant Presence of Mind that should support their Spirits amidst all Dan∣gers: From this there is no way to secure themselves, but by laying hold on him that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mighty, and able to save to the utmost, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, who is a present help at need, whose Eyes are in all Places, in Heaven and Earth, and in the great <HI>Deep;</HI> and those that Cry t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him in their Distress, he will surely hear them and deliver them out of all their Troubles, if they are sincere in Heart, and walk uprightly with him. For a Praying-<HI>Paul's</HI> sake w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> find, tho' the Ship was broken, and perished on a Rock on the Coast of the Island, antiently <HI>Melita,</HI> now called <HI>Malta,</HI> all that were in it were saved, when they expected nothing less than to be swallowed up in that dange∣rous Ocean, as we find in the <HI>Acts,</HI> Chap. <HI>27.</HI> Therefore the best thing I can recom∣mend to <HI>Mariners,</HI> and others that Navi∣gate the Deep, is to have a stedfast Reliance
<PB REF="5"/>on God in all their Dangers, nay at all times, for that is the best and surest Anchor hold and Security that recourse to can be had, and therefore I have furnished this Book with ma∣ny Wonderful and Remarkable <HI>Sea-Delive∣rances,</HI> to show them that their Hopes are not in vain; for the Wonders he has already wrought, he will doubtless continue to all that fear and put their Trust in him.</P>
<P>This <HI>Collection</HI> is taken mostly from the Mouths of those who have experienc'd God's Mercy this way, and whose Dangers have been as great as any could be on this side the Grave; yet God, in his Mercy, delivered them out of all. The rest are taken from such Reverend <HI>Authors,</HI> that their Credit and Integrity is indisputable, being purposely writ∣ten to raise the Minds of Men to contem∣plate and adore the Love and Goodness of the All wise Creator of the Universe, and may indifferently serve to this end as well at <HI>Land</HI> as <HI>Sea,</HI> though chiefly intended for <HI>Sea-fa∣ring</HI> Men, to put them in Mind, when they read it, of their Danger, and what they may expect in their Danger from the Death they apprehend in it, if they apply their Hearts to true Wisdom. When all Help or Hopes fail or seem to be at a loss, then fix your Hearts and Eyes stedfastly on him who is able to do all things, and to whom nothing is impossible; on him, in whose Hands is all the
<PB REF="6"/>Breath of Life, who can stop the Shafts of Death in their winged Motion, check the Bel∣lowing Thunder in the Mid Volley, and turn the Raging of the Winds to a sudden Calm.</P>
<P>But not to be tedious in a <HI>Preface;</HI> I re∣commend this to you, as a suitable Compa∣nion in your Voyages or Travels, nay in your Houses, or at all times, that you may know these things are the <HI>Lord's doing tho' they are Marvellous in your Eyes.</HI> And so conclude, subscribing my self,</P>

<P>ONE Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> a Man well known in <HI>New England,</HI> a Gen∣tleman of good Education, good Parts, and of good Conversation, (as the Author hath been credibly inform'd by them that knew him) was bound upon a Voyage to Sea, himself being <HI>Super Cargo</HI> with such Commodities as those Parts of <HI>America</HI> affords, after going out from <HI>Boston</HI> several days, by hard Weather, and contrary Winds, the Ships Company were much distress'd, and by the Continuance of contrary Winds, Provisions now begin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o fail them; and O how feeble do Spi∣rits grow, when Bread, the staff of Life fails! Now Hunger becomes more dread∣ful to them, than the every Moment t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reatning Billows of the devouring
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>Ocean; and they that one while fear'd drowning, now fear starving; they are brought to the last meal in the Barrel, and the last oyl in the Cruse, and say, <HI>We will Eat this little that is left and dye:</HI> And now when they thought they had eaten the last, what conflicts must they needs have within themselves, who knew not where to have another morsel to fortifie their tired and spent Spirits with the constant toil, and hard labour? How they look one upon another, as men already under a Sentence of Death? And by one ano∣thers Looks, strike terror to one anothers Hearts; They look on every side, <HI>Psal</HI> 142. 4, 5. (<HI>as David</HI> says) <HI>I looked on my right hand, but there was no man that would know me; Refuge failed me,</HI> or perished from me. They look downwards, and see nothing but the Belly of destruction opening for them; they look upwards, the onely and last refuge and reme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in this deplorable estate, and <HI>out of the depths they cry'd to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' they look out of the Ship, as <HI>Noah</HI> did out of his Ark, upon the waters and send forth the Dove of Prayer, that winged Messenger, to Heaven, yet she brings no. Olive-branch, no Answer; the Waters asswage not, the Winds calm not, they are like the Prophets Servant, when
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>he bids him, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18.43. <HI>Go up now and look towards the Sea; and he went up and looked and said, there is nothing;</HI> and this strikes them into doleful and dismal La∣mentations; out of which Lamentations, at last springs up a tragical and sorrowful Motion. The Motion is that which the Mariners in <HI>Jonah's</HI> Vessel put in execu∣tion, <HI>Come let us cast Lots,</HI> &amp;c. only with this difference, they cast Lots to find out the Delinquent, and these which of them should die first, to be a Sacrifice for ravenous Hunger to feed upon: Conclu∣ding, as he in that case, <HI>John</HI> 11.50. <HI>It is expedient for us that one man should die for the People, and that the whole Ships Company pe∣rish not.</HI> Life being sweet, Skin for Skin, and all that a Man hath will he give for his Life, they at last bring it, through many a sad debate, to a result, they cast the Lot, <HI>the disposing of which is of the Lord;</HI> one of the Company is arrested by the Lot; here is the Condemn'd Prisoner: O but where is the Executioner to be found to act his Office upon a poor Innocent? Is it not Death to them now, to think who shall act this bloody part in the Tragedy? But before they fall upon their involuntary Executi∣on, Major <HI>Gibbons</HI> calls them to Prayer, considering, that in the Moment the Lord is often seen, and that many times our Ex∣tremity
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>proves God's Opportunity; he also asks the poor Man if he was willing to die; but O what a hard Question is that to Answer! He replies, <HI>if it might preserve the rest of the Lives, he could be the more willing;</HI> to which he hath this An∣swer; <HI>All Events are in the hands of God, we must not dispute them;</HI> to Prayer they go; and, O sure these Prayers must melt hearts of Adamant! and Behold, while they are at it, God sends a visible Commentary up∣on that Scripture, <HI>Esa.</HI> 58.9. <HI>Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall Answer; thou shalt Cry, and he shall say here I am:</HI> For while they were calling, God was an∣swering; there leaps a mighty Fish into the Boat; and as it is said of the Whale that swallowed up <HI>Jonah, God prepared a Fish,</HI> so the Lord here prepared or pro∣vided a Fish, that a poor creature might not be swallowed up: But O what joy was here at such a token for good! it not only at present relieving and refreshing their Hunger, which no Question made them quick Cooks; but when they look'd upon the Finger of God in it, sending it as an answer to Prayer, they conclude it an happy Omen of their Deliverance, and a pledge of approaching Mercy: but alas, it is not long before their Hearts grew faint again, their Countenances pale,
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>their Spirits sink now as low as they were lifted up high; and now the poor Seamen are like their Ship, one while mounted up in hopes to Heaven, and another while they are sunk down again in despair as low as Hell; they know not now of another Cake, another Morsel, they are reduc'd to their former Exigency, which brings them to a resolve to steer in this strait their old course; to Lots they go again the second time, only they have such an Honour for the Providence of God, they will not put him into condemnation, that God hath acquitted; the Lot now falls upon another Person, and O now they re∣ceive the old trouble, and intestine Com∣bats, how they shall find in their Hearts, to punish one, that never had offended any of them; and while one thinks of it, says he, <HI>Alas poor Man, what hath he done to deserve this Sentence?</HI> another crys, <HI>Will not this Blood cleave to my Conscience another day; tho' I went to this expedition a Prest Soldier?</HI> another says, <HI>for his part he fees no way but Death, therefore he cannot take away Life, when he sees not any Life can be preserved by it:</HI> but they are call'd again to look up∣ward, before they put the Knife to the Throat of this Sacrifice, and they remem∣ber the last Encouragement to put Life into almost the Dead-mens Prayers; they
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>pray now with a pledge in their Hands, and are ready to tell God, the last time he gave them a Pawn, an Earnest; and O it is not in vain to seek the Lord. For lo, while they are seeking to him, he is send∣ing to them; as the Prayers fly to Hea∣ven, Mercy is dispatch'd upon the wing from Heaven.</P>
<P>O turn aside, and see this great sight, while they are praying! Behold a second Answer from above! A great Bird lights and fixes her self upon the Mast, which one in the Company espies, and up he goes and there he stands till he took her with his Hand by the wing, and brought her down to the Company; and O what life from the dead is this to them a second time! Sure they will hearken to the voice of the second Sign, if not to the voice of the first; and now that which they hoped by the first Providence <HI>(viz.)</HI> that it was a fore-runner of their compleat Deli∣verance; Now they are by this second con∣firm'd in the Faith, and now they begin to think (as I can easily imagine) if God will save them out of this distress, O what manner of Persons they will become! what manner of Lives they will live! what Sacrifices of Thanksgiving they will offer up to God! but while they are thus think∣ing they have no visible hopes, but that it
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>must be a third Miracle that brings them out of this their miserable condition; they have the same disappointments upon them still, only now they divert their Hunger all they can, by telling of, and remem∣bring the Loaves, (as I may say) their experiences in this extremity of theirs, and comforting themselves, that if they come to a third strait, it would (they ho∣ped) be an outlet from their present Mi∣sery and Calamity: They are reduc'd the third time to their former course and strait, to cast Lots; and when they were to go to the Heart-aking work, to put him to Death, upon whom the Lot fell, they go to their Old Friend, in a day of Adversity, (to God) by hearty and hum∣ble Prayer; And O now they do, as the Prophet's Man at the Sea side, look again and again, but alas Master they cry, <HI>there is nothing.</HI> Prayer is done, concluded, no∣thing appears; O but as the Prophet's Man looked seven times, so says this good Man Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> look again, as <HI>Jonah, I will look again towards his Holy Temple,</HI> (says he to one of the Company) <HI>Go up to the top, and see what you can espy;</HI> and at last he makes a Sail, <HI>(viz.)</HI> espies a Ship; this put new life into all their spirits; they bear up with the Vessel, they Man their Boat, they desire, in the manner of
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>perishing humble Suppliants, to board them, which they are admitted; the Ves∣sel proves a <HI>French</HI> Vessel, yea, a <HI>French</HI> Pirate; Major <HI>Gibbons</HI> petitions him for a little Bread to sustain their Lives, who had been several days wishing for Death, but could not find it in their extremity; and to take the Ship and Cargo. So sweet is Life, that <HI>all that a Man hath will he give for his Life;</HI> and now behold, God draws forth to the poor Perishing Men his best Wine at the last, nay, turns the Water of Affliction into the Wine of Consolation. The Commander of the Vessel knows the Major, and replies readily and chearful∣ly, Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> not one hair of your. Head shall perish, nor any of your Ships Company, if it lie in my power either to supply you, or preserve you. O the Wisdom of God that hath ways we know not of, to relieve in the greatest straits, and cause himself to be seen in the Mount. The Commander of this <HI>French</HI> Pirate was one that some Years before Major <HI>Gibbons</HI> had shown signal Kindness to, when his Life was in danger at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New England.</HI> Thus the Lord appeared a God hearing Prayers in Extremities, which appearances are not to be forgot∣ten in succeeding Generations. <HI>O that Men would praise the Lord for his Goodness,
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> About the Year 1636. there arising a Storm and Tempest of troubles in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> five Ministers, eminent for Piety, Learning, and their Honourable success in the Ministry, were so hard born under by a prevailing Party imposing upon their Consciences, that they were forc'd to Embarque themselves for <HI>America;</HI> three of their Names were Mr. <HI>Levinston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mackleland,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Blaire,</HI> with two more whom my Au∣thor could not call to mind.</P>
<P>These good Men sailed half the Chan∣nel over, about 500 Leagues, where they met with great distress of Weather, which broke off the Rudder of their Ship, and occasioned a desperate Leak to spring in her, which expos'd them to imminent dan∣ger; but they in this distress endeavour to hang on their Rudder again, but often were they frustrated in their attempt, to a total despair of effecting it. They also laboured with the like unsuccessfulness to find out and stop the Leak; this poor Ships Crew had labour'd also by pumping to keep the Ship above Water, until all their few Hands were feeble, and all their Hearts faint; so that as so many <HI>despair∣ing Persons</HI> of Life, they cease all endea∣vours,
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>and yield themselves to Death, ex∣pecting every Moment to be Entombed in the Belly of the Devouring Deep; during the time of this their great Di∣stress, the Ministers kept on their course, as at other times of Worship, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the reading of a Chapter in course, and taking observations from it, with Prayers and Preaching, which they did by turns; at the crisis of this deplorable case, it fell to be the Lot of Mr. <HI>Mackleland</HI> to per∣form this Exercise, a Man Austeer in his Life, reserv'd in his Speech, and of great Piety, who was often observ'd to let fall many remarkable Prophetical Expressions of future Events; the Chapter that at that time came to be read in course by him, was the 23 of <HI>Exodus,</HI> which he had read all along (until he came to the 12th <HI>verse</HI>) where he made a full stop; the verses run thus;</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> Moses <HI>besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord, why doth thy Wrath wax hot against thy People, which thou hast brought out of the Land of</HI> Egypt <HI>with great Power, and a mighty Hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians say, for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the Mountains, and to con∣sume them from the face of the Earth? Turn from thy severe Wrath, and repent of this E∣vil against thy People,</HI>— upon the reading
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>of these verses over again, he declared to them, the Case which <HI>Moses</HI> was here in∣terceeding for, compared with his Expo∣stulation in the 12 verse, did parallel their case, and considering the happy Event of that Argument which <HI>Moses</HI> used (men∣tioned in the 14 verse, which runs thus:) <HI>and the Lord repented of the Evil which he thought to do unto his People</HI>—he could not but comfortably hope, that they might have the same Effect: Nay he goes fur∣ther, and his Spirit was raised into a pe∣remptory prediction, that he durst assure them from his great Lord and Master, that not one Hair of his Head shall fall to the ground; after this he went to Prayer, urging God with the same Argument, and then rose up comfortably, assuring his stedfastness in believing the same; he advises the Seamen and the Company in the Ship to refresh themselve by taking some Meat, the long fasling and hard labour having much infeebled them. Then he encouraged them to make ano∣ther attempt to fasten the Rudder, with∣out which they could not possibly make towards any Point for Shore. He after advised them to clear the Ship, as well as they could, from Water by Pumping, which they did happily effect, the Leak being stopt providentially of it self,—
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>whether it was some noak of a Plank started by the distress of Weather which occasion'd the Leak, and by the surges of the Sea, clapt into the place again, or what it was else could not be known. But however this looks like Life from the Dead to these poor Men, who had received but a little before Sentence of Death in themselves, that they might trust in him who raiseth the Dead. Soon after this, God who had heard in Hea∣ven their Tears and Prayers, Commands the Wind to Tack about to the West, and to blow so strong a Gale that they were forc'd to bear up before it, and it continued so long, that it brought them back to the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where they continued some time, altho' but short, they were very instrumental in the Con∣verting of many Souls, which seed-plot remains to this Day; and soon after they passed into <HI>Scotland.</HI> This Relation was given by several Ministers of the North of <HI>Ireland:</HI> also the Reader may take no∣tice, the Author of that Book called the <HI>Fulfilling of the Scriptures,</HI> page 487. men∣tions this remarkable Providence, tho' not so largely, with these two additional, but very considerable circumstances; first, That a poor Seaman was made the in∣strument to preserve the same Vessel, by
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>fastening the Rudder, whose Company they had all shun'd, others having given it over. Secondly, Several Passengers being Aboard, who Shipt themselves for <HI>America,</HI> upon only external accounts, expecting a fat Soyl, and outward advan∣tage in that Place, and not as the others upon the account of Conscience, to en∣joy the purity of Ordinances; they did all Die upon the Sea save one, being five in Number. And who is so Blind, as can∣not see here the out-stretch'd Arm of an Omnipotent God, commanding delive∣rance for his poor distressed, persecuted, praying, believing Servants, and also for all them that sailed with them? O who would not Pray at Sea, and trust in him who raises the dead in the saddest of their Extremities and Distress! and speaks forth much of the power and goodness of God, calling upon all to trust in him, let the dangers and straits be never so great.</P>

<P N="3">3. A Vessel of ours about the Year 1636. being at <HI>Newfound-Land</HI> a Fishing, being somewhat of the latest in the year, until the Ice came in great flakes; and being ready to hoise Sail for their return home, they sent out in the Boat six of the Men to weigh their Anchor; but while they were about it, a sad Providence pre∣vents them, a great flake of Ice interposes
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>between them and their Ship, and car∣ries them adrift, so that by all means that they and the Ship could use, they could not recover their Vessel again, whereby they were expos'd to an inevitable ruine, neither having Food, nor any other Ac∣commodation to keep them warm; they having continued thus three days and three nights, they began to be Hunger∣starv'd, and accounting themselves all dead Men, they began to consult one with another what course to take; they at last, tho' with great regret and grief, resolve one of them must die to become Food for the rest; each Person begg'd to have it his Lot to die first, to be freed from that torment that they languished under; so that they were forced to de∣termine it by Lot: He upon whom the Lot fell, desir'd to go to one end of the Boat, there to recommend his Soul to God by Prayer, before he dyed; the rest being in a deep Agony upon the appre∣hension of shedding the Blood of one of their Comrades: But while they were sat together, lamenting and imploring God's favour to prevent such a fact, ac∣cording to that they wish'd and desir'd, the Person separated by Lot for Death, dyed upon the place where he was pray∣ing, which in their deplorable Condition
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>occasioned great Joy to the rest, that hereby they were not forced against their Wills to take his Life; so looking upon this as a good <HI>Omen,</HI> they proceeded to satisfie their Hungers upon the dead Body: The Boat was still a-drift, not frozen up; so that by that time their Food was spent, they were brought ashore many Leagues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Northward of <HI>New-England,</HI> where the five landed alive, and the poor <HI>Bar∣barians</HI> did commiserate them, and help them as they could, three of them died with the Distress they had been in, the other two made a shift to get to <HI>New-England,</HI> and so at last, by a good Hand upon them, came to their Habitations in the West of <HI>England,</HI> having both lost their Heels with the Extremity of the Cold in the Boat. This Relation my Author had from one of these two Sea-men, with whom he came afterwards a Passenger from <HI>Ireland,</HI> to whom he shew∣ed his Heels so lost.</P>

<P N="4">4. A small Vessel about 45 Tun, the Master's Name <HI>Philip Hangare,</HI> coming upon the Coast of <HI>New-England,</HI> they suddenly sprang a Leak and so foundred. There were in this poor miscarrying Ves∣sel 18 Seamen and Passengers; 12 of the Men got into the Long-boat, and as that was suddenly brought to their Minds in
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>this Surprise they threw into their Boat also some small matters of Provisions, but they were wholly without Fire: These 12 Men at that time of the Year about <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> (and as <HI>Paul</HI> said in his Voy∣age, <HI>Sailing was become Dangerous</HI>) sailed five hundred Leagues, and were to a Mi∣racle preserved all that time in this small Boat, five Weeks; but it pleased the Lord, who appears in our straits most, to send them great Relief, by causing some flying Fish to fall into the Boat, which they eat raw, and were unto them more accepta∣ble than the greatest Rarities and Dain∣ties at another time; God's Providence now proving the Caterer, they catch'd a Shark, and that ravenous Fish that uses to prey upon Men now becomes a Prey to these poor distressed Creatures; but they were glad of Food in the want of Fire, and have an Heat in their Stomachs to eat that raw, and digest at this time what would have made them sick at other times; but alas, another Want they had, was Drink as well as Fire, but they were forced to open the Belly of this Shark, and suck his Blood for Drink; at last, that God who hath a Desire to the Work of his own Hands, gives them Hopes to release them out of this insupportable Misery, by letting them come to a Discovery of
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>Land in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> but alas, they were so Weak, that when they came a∣shore, one or two of them Dyed; but most of them liv'd to declare the Works of the Lord. This the Author had from one of the 12 that were thus miraculous∣ly preserv'd, but since cast away at Sea.</P>

The last Providence called to mind a strange and stupendous passage of a Godly Gentlewoman, who in the first breaking forth of the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was forc'd to fly for her Life, with some other Persons in her Company; especial∣ly three Children, one of them upon her Breast: But alas, these poor trembling
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>Travellers had not gone long before they were stripp'd Naked by the <HI>Irish,</HI> who to admiration spar'd their Lives; but passing on to the foot of a River, others met'em, and would have cast 'em into the River; but this Godly Woman not being dis∣may'd, ask'd a little liberty to Pray, and as she lay on frozen ground Naked, she got a little resolution not to go on her own Feet to so unjust a Death; upon which having call'd her, upon her reso∣lution, they drag'd her by the Heels a∣long the ground, with the rest of the Company; she turns upon them, and on her Knees says, <HI>You should I am sure be Christians, and Men I see you are; in taking away our miserable Lives, you do us a plea∣sure; but know, as we never wronged you, nor yours, you must die also your selves, and one day give an account of this Cruelty to the Judge of Heaven and Earth.</HI> Suddenly up∣on which, an <HI>Irish</HI> Priest says, <HI>Let us not take their Lives, but we will put them in this Island of the Lake;</HI> a Boat being at the River, all the eight Naked, and without Meat, are turn'd into that Island, where after four days staying, some of the Com∣pany dy'd with Hunger and Cold, but not this Woman, nor any of her Chil∣dren; a day after, the two Boys found the Hyde of a Beast which had been

<P N="7">7. In the first setling of the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands off of the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Florida,</HI> about the Year 1642. there were at that present great troubles in the <HI>Burmudas,</HI> one Cap∣tain <HI>Sale,</HI> who had been Governour the Year before, comes for <HI>London,</HI> and here informing some of his Acquaintance, and Persons of Worth and Estate, how things then stood, they undertake for him, and got him a Ship, and all things necessary for the discovery of these <HI>Islands</HI> which he had inform'd them of, so they proceeded to <HI>Burmudas,</HI> where they took
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>in several Passengers, Capt. <HI>Sale</HI> being Chief, and Capt. <HI>Lane</HI> and his Family, who came from <HI>London</HI> with him as his Assistant in the management of the Design; so they, in pursuit of the Voy∣age, came to an Island call'd <HI>Cicatra,</HI> he lay down in the Platts, where they could not at present find an Harbour. So they sent out their <HI>Shallop</HI> upon a Discovery, which upon Return, inform'd them of a better place to Ride in.—But sending out the <HI>Shallop</HI> again upon a Discovery, before she Return'd, there arose a dread∣ful Storm, that carried her immediately upon the <HI>Rocks,</HI> and stav'd her, with ve∣ry much difficulty most of the People were sav'd, and some Provisions. Then were they Reduc'd to very great straits formidable to Flesh and Blood, a Barren Island, no Inhabitants, no likelihood of Relief, little Provisions left; in this great strait most of them resolv'd to Travel up to the Western end of the Island, and there to abide. Capt. <HI>Lane</HI> and his Family, and Son, who was Lieutenant, resolv'd to seek for some kind of Provisions, and so staid on the Island. But Captain <HI>Sale</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Bounly,</HI> who had been Master of the Ship, and some other <HI>Seamen,</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Shadwel,</HI> in all eight, resolv'd to go
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and took what Provisions they could get, which was one <HI>Shark;</HI> but before they made to the Land, they were in very great want; for from this Island from whence they departed to <HI>Virginia,</HI> was 300 Leagues: In their now great Extremity, Providence car'd for them, so that they got another <HI>Shark,</HI> and were glad to eat him Raw. They were 11 days going to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the <HI>Boat</HI> a very little one, that they could scarcely Steer in her for fear of Danger. Yet the Lord, in this deep Destress, <HI>made his Arm bare for their Salvation,</HI> and brought them safe to a place call'd <HI>Nuse∣mum,</HI> to one Mr. <HI>Rich. Brunkets</HI> House, where they were courteously Entertain∣ed; and after the Relation upon what account they were put to these Hard∣ships and Necessities, Capt. <HI>Sale</HI> had a Vessel provided Laden with Necessaries, to go for <HI>Cicatra,</HI> to relieve those they had left there in such Distress, and they arrived there. And O now what Com∣fort must this be, after such long Wish∣ing and gradual Dying, to see that there was no Hopes of Life brought to them; but several of them were starv'd to Death before their arrival. Capt. <HI>Lane</HI> is now sent to fetch some Provisions, who had been in unspeakable Extremity. He
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>came down in a little <HI>Boat,</HI> his Son also, the Lieutenant, and two Servants, but when they had gotten in their Provisi∣on, and going home in hopes of a new Life; Behold, the stupendous Provi∣dence of God, all of a sudden Death creeps in and arrests them. For in a narrow place where the Tyde runs swiftly, the <HI>Boat</HI> is sunk, all are drown'd but one Man, who carried the desolate Widow the sad Tydings! What an un∣welcome Messenger this was you may may easily conjecture; about 3 Months after, arrived a Vessel to them (the Ma∣ster of her my Author,) and so Mrs. <HI>Lane,</HI> her Son and Daughter, Maid-servant and Man-servant, were all brought up a∣bout 40 Miles, where they were Enter∣tain'd by my Author for 6 Weeks, and gave an account of some notable Passa∣ges of God's Providence in preserving them. Worthy never to be forgotten! Her Husband and the Men went out to see what they could get for Food every Day, and they had for the most part just for the Day, and she told my Author, that she as a tender-hearted Mother, would lay something by for her young Children; but she observ'd, that the next Day they never got any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31"/>And thus Providence train'd them up in the School of Faith; but further she gave an account of one remarkable thing. In the last day of the week, upon a time it prov'd a very stormy Day, and they being abroad a hunting for some support, could get nothing. The Husband and Son come home very much troubled, and the Men that were gone into the Woods they could get nothing; and they being very much troubled, one took up a Resolution not to come home, know∣ing there Captain would not suffer them to go and hunt on the Lord's-Day; on the other hand they thought he would wonder what was become of them, and fear lest evil had befallen them; so they alter their Resolution to come home, but empty of Relief; this very Evening before the Sabbath in this perplexity of thoughts, there fly over their Heads three gray <HI>Geese;</HI> a wonder it was, for such <HI>Geese</HI> were never before seen there nor after. O says she to her Husband, that we had some of them, against to mor∣row! observing they lighted in a Bottom, she acquaints her Husband, he says they have no shot left. O says she, here is a Porrenger, melt it or cut it into peices, which he did for expedition, and charg'd his Peice, and at the first shot kill'd them
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>all.—These things, and many more my Author had from her own Mouth, after her marvellous Preservation. <HI>O that Men would Praise the Lord, for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men!</HI></P>

We have a very wonderful Delive∣rance recorded, an honest poor Man in <HI>Maulden</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> one <HI>Gregory Crow,</HI> who with his Man and Boy, was in his Boat going to fetch Fullers-Earth; but by the way meeting a Storm his Boot was driven upon a bank of sand, and there sunk; The Men were glad to hang upon the Mast, but poor <HI>Crow</HI> seeing his New-Testament in the water, which he priz'd highly, caught it up, and took it into his Bosom; the tyde being gone, they were left upon the Sand, at least ten Miles from Land; now in this great Distress they made their prayers to the Lord, that he would send some means of Deliverance. For now within half an hour it would be Flood, but in this little time before Flood, they found a Chest wherein was five pounds six Shillings eight pence, but honest <HI>Crow</HI> cast it into the Sea again saying, <HI>If the Lord will be pleas'd to save our lives he will provide us a little food;</HI> and so they went again up to the Mast, where they to Admiration hung by the Arms and Leggs for ten hours together, only the
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>Boy was so weary, and beaten with the Waves that he fell off, and was drowned; now their fears increased upon them, and they knew not what to do. But <HI>Crow</HI> advises his Man to cut down the Mast, and when the Flood comes again, to sit upon it, and so, says he, <HI>it may please God to drive us to some Ship;</HI> this Counsel was taken, they commit them∣selves to God upon the Mast, and thus continu'd <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night <HI>Wednesday</HI> and <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night; in which time the man was so tir'd out with Hunger, Watching, and Cold, that he dyed; now was <HI>Crow</HI> left alone in this sad and deplorable Con∣dition, he pray'd now the more earnestly for some Succour and Relief, but durst not Sleep, lest the Sea should beat him off the Mast, and when this distress'd mi∣serable object was almost spent, his flesh sodden with Sea water, and his Eyes al∣most clos'd up with Salt, now in his Ex∣tremity the Lord makes it his oppor∣tunity, and steps in by his Providence, presents a Ship going for <HI>Antwerp:</HI> (ob∣serve here the Finger of God:) The wind not being favourable she was driven out of the way, and espyed something a far off in the Sea, but supposing it to be some Fisher-boy steer'd from it. <HI>Crow</HI> seeing this, held up his Cap and shaked
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>it over his head, whereby at length they were mov'd to go to him, and so they took him in; when he came into the Ship, being half dead, careful of his <HI>New-Testament,</HI> he pluckt it out of his Bosom and gave it to some to dry. They in the Ship were careful of him, and with great difficulty recover'd him, and carry'd him with them to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where the fame of his being miraculously deliver'd, drew many to see him, and relieve him with necessaries. <HI>Fox</HI>'s <HI>Book of Martyrs.</HI></P>

<PB N="34" REF="40"/>black thing float upon the Sea, and look∣ing upon it very fixtly, he conceives it to be a Boat, and so calls to the Men below, so they hastned to hoise Sail and make to∣wards it; and when they came to them, there was a Long-boat with 11 or 13 Men, (my Author could not absolutely remember the just Number) which poor distressed Creatures had been bound for <HI>Virginia;</HI> and the Ship in which they were, prov'd very Leaky, and so exceedingly increas'd, that in a very little time she was ready to sink; so all Hands hasten'd to get out the Boat, but the Master stept into the Cabin to fetch a Compass, and took some Canvas, a Sail-needle and Twine, which he thought might be use∣ful to them in their Need and Extremity; but while this poor industrious Man was endeavouring to be useful to some other Mens Lives, he was in danger to lose his own; for the Boat was put off and the Ship was sinking, so he crys to them in this Di∣stress, <HI>if they would leave him, and there let him perish;</HI> so they came back and took him in; they had in their Boat a Capstern-Bar, which they made use of for a Mast, and a piece of Canvas for a Sail, and so sailed afore the Wind, and had no kind of Food; and now comes dreadful and inexpressible Distress upon them making them wish for
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>Death it self to give them a Deliverance, now all Hopes of Relief fail'd them; thus they continu'd five Days, some grew Lame, others Feeble, and all much Dis∣hearten'd by Despair of Life; and now upon the 6th Day they had concluded to cast Lots for their Lives who should die to preserve others; and they put their Resolution into Execution, and that poor Creature upon whom the Lot fell, begs for Time; but alas, what will a Reprieve be in this Case, where there is no hope of Relief; but O what difficult Work is it to die? what a strait was here? Live he could not, and die he could not; well, a little time is defer'd, and behold a Won∣der-working God appears now for him and for them all; before Night they e∣spy'd this Ketch, which rais'd them all to Admiration; but they had Fears in this Distress that the Ketch did not see them; but when they perceiv'd the Ketch made to them, O what a new Life did it put into these dying Men; so they all got safe aboard: And see here the Goodness of God: In one Hour after there arose a most dreadful Storm which continu'd for forty Hours, and all of them safely arriv'd at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>

<P N="25">25. <HI>Anno Christi.</HI> 1630. <HI>May</HI> 1. the <HI>Mos∣covy</HI> Merchants of <HI>London</HI> sent a Ship call'd the <HI>Salutation</HI> of <HI>London</HI> for <HI>Greenland,</HI> which arriv'd there in safety <HI>June</HI> 11. following, together with two other Ships, all which were commanded by Captain <HI>Will. Goodler.</HI> The Ship wherein the Capt. was, stayed at <HI>Bell-sound;</HI> This of the <HI>Salutation</HI> at the <HI>Foreland:</HI> And the Capt. meeting with store of <HI>Whales,</HI> quickly made a Great Voyage, and so sent for the <HI>Salutation</HI> to take in part of his Train-Oyl: By the way, as they went to him, meeting with Cross-Winds, the Master set Eight of his Men on Shore to kill some Venison, in a place where there used to be good store. These Men ta∣king with them a Brace of Dogs, a Snap∣hance, two Lances, and a Tnider-Box went on Shore, and that day they laid Fourteen Good Deer on the Ground: And then, being weary, and the Night
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>coming on, they betook themselves to Rest, intending the next day to make an end of their Hunting, and so to return to their Ship: But the next day proved <HI>Foggy,</HI> and there was much Ice between the Shore and the Ship, and the Wind coming Southerly, the Ship was fain to stand so far off into the Sea to be clear of the Ice, that they lost the sight of her; and the Weather growing thicker and thicker, they thought fit to Hunt along the Shoar to <HI>Green-Hurbour,</HI> and there to stay aboard the Ship, till their own Ship should come into the Port.</P>
<P>In this Passage they killed Eight Deer more, and so having laden their Shallop with Venison, they kept on their course to <HI>Green Harbour:</HI> But when they came thither, they found, to their great Asto∣nishment, that the Ship was departed. Being thus frustrated of their Expection, and having but three days to the utter∣most expiration of their limited time for their departure out of that Country, they thought it their best course to make all speed possible to <HI>Bell-Sound,</HI> to their Cap∣tain; and lest delay should prove dan∣gerous, they lightned their Shallop by heaving their Venison over board into into the Sea, and so they hasted all they might, and that night got half-way: But
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>the dark <HI>Fog</HI> increasing, they were forc'd to cove in a point of the Land till the next day at Noon: At which time the Weather being clearer, they hasted for∣ward; but having no compass to direct their, course by, they wandred up and down so long, till the Ships were depart∣ed. This filled them with fear and astonishment, knowing that neither Christian nor Heathen had ever Inha∣bited those desolate Climates: Yea, they had heard that the Merchants had en∣deavour'd, with proffers of Great Re∣wards, and of sufficient Furniture, and Provision of all things necessary, to hire some to undertake to Winter in those parts, but could never meet with any that would adventure their Lives in so hazardous an Undertaking: They had heard also, that the Company of <HI>Moscovy</HI> Merchants had once procur'd the <HI>Re∣prieve</HI> of some <HI>Malefactors</HI> condemn'd to Death here in <HI>England,</HI> unto whom they promised Pardon, together with Re∣wards and Provision of Cloaths, Victuals, and all other Necessaries, if they would stay one Winter there: But when they came thither, and took a view of the desolateness of the Place, they conceiv'd such horror and fear in their Hearts, that they chose rather to return for
<PB N="57" REF="63"/><HI>England,</HI> and there to satisfie the Law with the loss of their Lives, than to stay in so desolate and darksome a Country. They remembred also a more terrible Example, of Nine Good and Able Men left there formerly by the same Master that had now left them, who all Died Miserably upon the place; and whose Bodies were fearfully disfigur'd by the Savage Bears, and Hungry Foxes, which are the only Inhabitants of that comfort∣less Country: All which made them like amazed Men, to stand one looking upon another, every one foreseeing the future Calamities, both of himself and of his Fellows: And that which much increas'd their horror, was, their want of all necessary Provision for the Life of Man, having neither Clothes to keep them warm, and for shift, nor Food to prevent the Miseries of cruel Famine, nor a House to shroud themselves from the extremity of Cold.</P>
<P>But after a Space, knowing that Delay in Extremity is the Mother of all Dan∣ger, they began to conceive Hope out of the Depth of Despair; and therefore they consulted together of the likeliest Course for their Preservation in that Place, and resolv'd upon the Opportu∣nity of the next fair Weather to go to
<PB N="58" REF="64"/><HI>Green-Harbour</HI> to kill some Venison for part of their Winter Provision, which accordingly they did, but found not so many Dear as they expected; yet the first Day they killed Seven, and Four Bears to Boot, which they also intend∣ed to eat: The next Day they killed Six Deer more, and as they returned, they killed Six more; and then the Weather proving foul and cold, they la∣ded their Shallop with the Deer and Bears, and finding another Shallop left there as usually they do from Year to Year, they laded it with Greaves of Whales that had been boiled there that Year, and so dividing themselves into those 2 hallops, they took the first Op∣portunity of returning to <HI>Bell-Sound</HI> to their Tent, where they intended to take up the rest for the Winter.</P>
<P>But in their Passage, the Night com∣ing on, and the Wind blowing hard, were forc'd to stay in the mid way at <HI>Bottel Cove</HI> for that Night: There they fasten'd their Shallops one to another, and casting out their Anchor, they left them riding in the <HI>Cove.</HI></P>
<P>But here again, <HI>for the trial of their Pa∣tience, and to teach them to rely more upon upon God's Providence, than than upon any outward Means of their own,</HI> this mischance
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>befel them: The Wind blowing hard into the <HI>Cove,</HI> and their Anchor coming home, their Shallop sunk into the <HI>Sea,</HI> and so wet all their Provision, and some of it they found swimming up and down by the shoar: The sight thereof, won∣derfully troubled them, to see the best part of their Provision, the only hope of their Lives under God, in danger either utterly to be lost, or to be spoil'd by the <HI>Sea-water,</HI> for which they had taken such pains, and run so many adventures in the getting of it: and in this their Misery, they saw but one remedy, and that was a desperate one, <HI>viz.</HI> to turn into the high∣wrote <HI>Sea</HI> to their Shallops to save the re∣mainder of their Provisions, now ready to be wash'd away by the Billows: This they did, and by main force drew the Shallops to the shore; then they went a∣long by the <HI>Sea-side</HI> to gather up such of their Provisions as were swimming up and down: and when the Weather prov'd fair, they went on to <HI>Bell-sound:</HI> where being arriv'd, they took out their Provi∣vision, and viewed the great Tent which was built of Timber and Boards, and co∣vered with <HI>Flemish</HI> Tiles: The use of it was for the <HI>Coopers</HI> to Work and Lodge in whilst they made Casks for the putting up of the Train-Oyl; and they resolved to
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>build another smaller Tent within that for their Habitations; and accordingly, taking down a lesser Tent that stood near to it, wherein the Land-men lay whilst they made their Oyl, they fetch'd their materials from thence, both Boards, Posts, and Rafters, and from the Chimnies of the Furnaces, they took a thousand Bricks; they found also four Hogsheads of Lime, which mingled with sand from the shoar, made good Mortar; But the Weather was grown so extream cold, that they were fain to make 2 Fires on both sides, to keep their Mortar from freezing; then they raised a Wall of one Brick thickness against the inner Planks of the side of the Tent, but by that time they had Wall'd 2 sides of their House, their Bricks fail'd, so that they were forc'd to build the other 2 sides of Boards; which be∣ing nail'd on both sides the Posts, they were hollow between, which they fill'd up with Sand, that made it so tite, that the least breath of Air could not possibly annoy them. The length of this Tent was 20 foot, and the breadth 16; their Chimney was the breadth of a Deal∣board, and 4 foot high; they Ciel'd it with Boards of 5 or 6 times double, that no Wind could possibly get thro': The Door they made as close as they could,
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>and lin'd it with a Bed that they found there, which came over both the open∣ing and shutting of it: they made no Windows, having no light but what came thro' the Chimney: then set they up 4 Cabins, quartering themselves two and two in a Cabin; their Beds were the Deer-skins dry'd, which was a warm and comfortable Lodging for them in their Distress: Their next care was for Firing, and finding 7 old Shallops which were unserviceable, they brake them up, and stow'd them over the beams of the great Tent to make it the warmer, and to keep the Snow from driving thro' the Tiles into the Tent: and by this time the cold increasing, and scarce having any Day at all, they stav'd some emp∣ty Cask, and brake two old Coolers (wherein they cool their Oyl) provid∣ing whatsoever Firing they could with∣out prejudice to the next Years Voyage: yet considering the small quantity of Fewel, the extremity of Cold, and the long time of their aboad, they Husband∣ed it as thriftily as possibly they could.</P>
<P>Having thus fitted every thing in the best manner they could, on the 12 of <HI>Sept.</HI> looking out into the Sound, they espy'd 2 Sea-Horses lying a Sleep on a piece of Ice, whereupon, taking up an
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>old harping-iron, they hasten'd to them, and first slew the old one, and the the young,; and so bringing them ashore, they flay'd them, roasted, and eat them. Not long after they kill'd another; but the Nights and cold. Weather increasing on them, and they viewing their Provi∣sion, found it too small by half; where∣upon they stinted themselves to one rea∣sonable Meal a day, and agreed to fast <HI>Wednesdays</HI> and <HI>Fridays,</HI> excepting from the Greaves and Fritters of the Whale (which was a very loathsome Meat) of which they allow'd themselves sufficient for their present Hunger: at which Diet they continu'd for about 3 Months.</P>
<P>Having finished whatever they could invent for their Preservation; they found that all their Clothes and Shoes were worn, and torn; to repair which, they had this new device, of Rope-yarn they made Thread, and of Whale-bones Needles to sow their Clothes withal: But <HI>Octob.</HI> 10. the Nights being grown very long, and the Cold so violent, that all the Sea was Frozen over; and they having now nothing to exercise their Minds upon, were troubled with a thou∣sand imaginations: Sometimes they be∣wail'd <HI>their absence from their Wives and Children, thinking what grief it would be to
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>them to hear of their miscarriage:</HI> then <HI>they thought of their Parents, and what a cutting corrosive it would be to them to hear of their untimely Deaths,</HI> &amp;c. And being tormented in their Minds with Fear, and Grief, and pinched in their Bodies with Hunger, and Cold, the hideous Monster of Desperation, presented his ugliest shape unto them: But thinking it not best to give way to Grief and Fear, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y doubled their <HI>Prayer</HI> to <HI>Al∣mighty God</HI> for Strength and Patience in their Miseries, by whose Assistance, they shook off their former Thought, and chear'd up themselves to use the best means for their preservation.</P>
<P>Then for the preservation of their Venison, and lengthening of their Fire∣ing, they thought best to roast every day half a Deer, and to stow it in Hogs∣heads, which accordingly they did, leav∣ing so much raw as would serve to roast every <HI>Sabbath day</HI> a quarter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And when this was over, they began again to think of their ensuing Misery, that in case God should give them Life, yet they were to live as Banished Men from all Company; and as if their Sorrows had been too little, they presently found an increase of it; for their Whale-Frit∣ters, after they had been drench'd in the
<PB N="64" REF="70"/><HI>Sea-water,</HI> lying close together, were grown mouldy, and spoiled: And again surveying their Bear and Venison, they found that it would not afford them five Meals a Week, whereupon they were fain to cut off one Meal more; so that for three Months after, four days in the Week they fed upon the unsavory moul∣dy Whale-Fritters, and the other three they feasted with Bear and Venison: But beside the want of Meat, they now be∣gan to want Light, so that all their Meals were Suppers: For, from <HI>Octob.</HI> 10, to <HI>Febr.</HI> 3. the never saw the Sun so much as peep above the Horizon: But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Moon, when not obscur'd with Clouds they always saw shining as bright as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>England:</HI> All which darksome time, they could not certainly tell when it should be Day, and when Night.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this darkness, they sought some means to preserve Light, and finding a piece of Sheet-Lead, and some Oyl in the Coopers Tent, and Rope-yarn they made a Lamp, which they kept con∣tinually burning, which was a great com∣fort to them in their extremity; yet their Wants and Miseries were so many, and great, that sometimes they brake forth into impatient Speeches against the cau∣sers of them, but then their Consciences a∣gain
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>minded them after their own <HI>Evil deserts,</HI> and so they took it as a just Hand of God for their former wicked Lives; or that God intended to make them Exam∣ples of his Mercy in their wonderful deli∣verance: <HI>Humbling themselves therefore un∣der the mighty Hand of God, they prostrated themselves in Prayer two or three times a day,</HI> which course they constantly held all the time of their Misery.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> as the days began to lengthen, the cold began to strengthen; which proceeded to that ex∣tremity, that it raised blisters on their Flesh as if they had been burnt with Fire, and if at any time they touched Iron, it would stick to their Fingers like Bird∣lime: If they went out of Doors to fetch in a little Water it would so pinch them, that they were sore as if they had been beaten. In the beginning of Winter, with Pick-axes breaking the Ice daily, they got some Water on the Sea-shore: but after <HI>January</HI> 10. they had none but Snow-water which they melted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot Irons, which was their only Drink <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill <HI>May</HI> 20. following.</P>
<P>By the last of <HI>Jan.</HI> the Days were 7 or 8 Hours long, and then viewing their Victuals again, they found that it would not last above six Weeks longer, which
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>made them fear further Famine; but <HI>they had recourse to God,</HI> who they knew, could supply them beyond their hopes.</P>
<P>Looking out on a bright day, they saw a great she Bear with her Cub coming toward their Tent, whereupon Arming themselves with their Lances, the went forth, and staid her coming; she soon cast her greedy Eye upon them, and hoping to devour them, hasted towards them: But with their Lances they gave her such an hearty welcome, that she tumbled upon the Ground, biting the Snow for anger: The Cub seeing this, escap'd by flight: The Weather was so extream Cold, that they were fain pre∣sently to retire into the Tent, and hav∣ing warmed themselves, they drew in the dead Bear, wherewith they Dined merrily; and this Bear serv'd them 20 days: Only this mischance they had, Eating her Liver, it made their Skins peel off; when she was spent, they yet fear'd that their Venison would not hold out till the Fleet came out of <HI>England;</HI> but God sent many Bears to their Tent, by times, at least 40, whereof they kill'd 7; One of which was exceeding great, at least 6 Foot High; so that their Food in∣creasing, they kept not themselves to such short Commons, but oft Eat two or three
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>Meals a Day, which much increased their strength.</P>
<P>By this, the chearful Days lengthen'd so fast, that several sort of Fowl resorted thither. <HI>March</HI> 16. one of their Mastiffs went abroad which they never saw after; upon the coming of the Fowls, the Foxes, which all Winter had kept their Bur∣roughts under the Rocks, came abroad to seek for their livings; whereupon they set up Traps, which they baited with the Skins of these Fowls, by which means they caught at times 50 Foxes; all which they roasted, and found to be good Meat: Then taking the Bear-skins, laying the Fleshy side upwards, and making Springs of Whale-bone, the caught about sixty Fowls as big as Pigeons.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 1. The Weather began to be pret∣ty warm, so that they went daily abroad to seek for Provision: but nothing they could find for many Days, till at length they met with abundance of <HI>Willocks</HI> Eggs; of which the carried home thirty, intending the next day to fetch a 1000 more, but the Day proved so Cold that they could not stir out of their Tent. The same Day there came two Ships of <HI>Hull</HI> into the Sound, who knowing that some Men had been lest there the Year before, being very desirous to know whe∣ther
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>they were Deat or Alive, the Master Mann'd forth a Shallop to go as near the shore as they could, and so over the Ice to the Tent: When these Men came near the Tent, they haled them with the usual word of the Sea, crying <HI>Hey:</HI> to which one of them in the Tent answered again <HI>Hoe;</HI> which sudden answer almost amaz'd them all: but perceiving them to be the very Men left there, with joyful Hearts they embrac'd one another, and so com∣ing into the Tent, they shew'd the <HI>Hul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men</HI> the Courtesie of the House, giving them some Venison that was Roasted 4 Months before, and a cup of cold Water, which for novelty sake they kindly ac∣cepted of them.</P>
<P>After a little Discourse, these 8 Men resolved to leave their Tent, and to go with them to their Ship, where they were welcom'd after the heartiest and kindest <HI>English</HI> manner: and so they staid with them till the <HI>London</HI> Fleet came, which was three days after: At which time they went aboard the Admiral, in which Capt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Will. Goodler</HI> was, who made them very welcome, and gave order that they should have any thing that was in the Ship that might do them good: he gave them Ap∣parel also, to the value of 20 Pounds. So that after 14 days refreshment, they grew
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>all perfectly well: But when some of them went to their own Master that had left them there, he fell foul upon them, calling them <HI>Run-aways,</HI> with other harsh terms, far enough from the Civility of an honest Man. Thus they continu'd in the Fleet until <HI>Aug.</HI> 20. at which time, with joyful Hearts, they set Sail through the foaming Ocean; and though sometimes crossed with contrary Winds, yet at last they came safely to an Anchor in the Ri∣ver <HI>Thames;</HI> and the <HI>Muscovy Merchants</HI> dealt very well by them.</P>
<P>The Names of these Men, were <HI>Will. Fakely</HI> Gunner: <HI>Edw. Pelham</HI> Gunners-Mate, that wrote this Story. <HI>Joh. Wise,</HI> and <HI>Rob. Goodfellow,</HI> Seamen: <HI>Tho. Ayers,</HI> Whale-cutter: <HI>Hen. Bet,</HI> Cooper: <HI>John Dawns,</HI> and <HI>Rich. Kellet,</HI> Landmen.</P>
<P><HI>Greenland,</HI> is a Country that lies very far North-ward in 77 Degrees, and 40 Mi∣nutes, it's wonderful Mountainous, which Mountains are all the Year long cover'd with Ice and Snow. The Plains in part are bare in Summer: But there grows neither Tree nor Herb in it, except <HI>Scur∣vey-grass</HI> and <HI>Sorrel:</HI> The Sea is as barren as the Land, affording no Fish but Whales, Sea-horses, Seals, and some few small Fishes</P>

<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="account">
<P N="26">26. In <HI>June</HI> 1668. the <HI>Peach-tree</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> a small Vessel of the Burthen of about
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>60 Tons, <HI>Edw. Dixon</HI> Master, came into the <HI>Downs,</HI> bound for <HI>Guinny,</HI> intending there to take in <HI>Negroes,</HI> and to transport them to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and from thence to come for <HI>London,</HI> where <HI>John Watts,</HI> the Son of <HI>John Watts</HI> of <HI>Eltham</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent</HI> Chirurgeon, Shipt him∣self with the consent of <HI>Rich. Watts</HI> pub∣lick Notary of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al;</HI> little dreading that his Nephew, being then not above 18 Years old, should meet with such a cala∣mitous Accident. The Ship had not been long in the <HI>Downs,</HI> but a fair Gale pre∣senting, they suddenly hoisted Sail, God's Providence seeming to fill their Sails with Prosperous Success; the 'first place they touch'd at, was the <HI>Gold Coast,</HI> where they staid not long, but Sail'd to old <HI>Calabar,</HI> in the <HI>Bith</HI> of <HI>Guinny.</HI> They enter'd a Ri∣ver, call'd the <HI>Cross River</HI> into <HI>Pirats</HI> Island. After they had taken in their <HI>Negroes,</HI> and ready to Sail, their Anchor being a Peek, the Master calls up the <HI>Boatswain</HI> and 3 Men more, whereof the Relater was one, and commands them to look out the Cop∣per Bars that were left, and carry them on Shore to try if they could sell them: the <HI>Boatswain,</HI> with his small Company, de∣sired that they might have Arms with them, not believing the report of some that inform'd them they were a harmless
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>and innocent People: They took with them three Muskets and a Pistol, and so Row'd towards the Shore; but not far from it, unhappily our Match fell into the Water, and the Ship being fall'n down from that narrow part of the River, near∣er the Sea, quite out of sight, we were consulting what should be safest for us to do: we were not willing to precipitate our own Ruin, and were also asham'd to re∣turn to our Ship before we had dispatch'd what we were commanded to: at length the <HI>Boatswain</HI> commanded the Relater, <HI>John Watts</HI> on shore, to the first House to light our Match, which we recover'd out of the Water, after it was extinct, which he readily obey'd: But before he was 20 Rods from the Water-side, he was seiz'd on by 2 Black (or rather Tawny-moors) and by them haled above half a Mile up into the Country, and thrown with great violence upon his Belly, and so compell'd to lie till they stript him; and more Company coming to them, they were so eager for his poor Canvas Apparel, that some they tore off, others they cut off, and with that several pieces of his Flesh, to this intolerable pain: with these Rags, they made little Childrens Aprons to co∣ver their Privities; Linnen and Woollen being scarce there. The <HI>Boatswain</HI> see∣ing
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>this <HI>Joh. Watts</HI> was thus carried away, was resolv'd with his other two Compa∣nions to have him again, or else to ven∣ture all their Lives for him: They Arm themselves; but whilst they were con∣sulting what to do, whether to venture on shore, or not, of a sudden they were beset with about 12 Men in several Ca∣noes, but they valianly maintain'd their Boat about the space of 3 Hours, for af∣ter 2 of their 3 Muskets were discharg'd, they defended themselves with their Oars, and Boat-hooks. The <HI>Boatswain</HI> re∣ceiv'd a mortal Wound in his Groin, and fell down in the Boat; the other two ad∣ventur'd in the River, endeavouring by Swimming to escape the merciless Hands of cruel Infidels; but the <HI>Negroes</HI> with their swift Canoes soon over-took them, and brought them on shore to the place where the Relater was. The <HI>Negroes</HI> took the <HI>Boatswain</HI> out of the Ships Boat; and instead of endeavouring at all to pre∣serve the Life which remain'd in him, immediately they rob'd him of it; one of them with a keen weapon cutting off his Head before his Companions Faces; and then they prepare for their rare Ban∣quet, while he was yet reeking in his Blood; they in a barbarous manner cut∣ting off pieces of Flesh from off his But∣tocks,
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>and his Thighs and his Arms, and Shoulders, and broil'd them on the Coals, and with a great deal of impatience, ea∣gerly eat it before our Faces, to our great astonishment. About 14 days after, one of the Company fell Sick, and instead of being Physicians to cure him, they were his Butchers to Murder him. They served him as they did the <HI>Boatswain,</HI> cut off his Head, and broil'd and eat up his Flesh, and rejoic'd exceedingly at this rich Banquet. About 10 days after, the third fell Sick, whom they served in the same manner.</P>
<P>This was no small cause of Sorrow to the Relater; the thoughts of their Inhu∣man and Barbarous actions, sometimes surrounded him with Fears and Sorrows, hourly expecting to taste of the said Cru∣elty. Death did not seem so terrible to him, as the violent manner of it; being left now alone in a strange Country, de∣stitute of Friends or Acquaintance, or any thing that might keep up his Spirits: Die he would fain, but not by the Hands of Infidels and barbarous Monsters. But the great God, that is most compassionate in the greatest extremities, had pity on him, and notwithastnding the alteration of the Climate, and the want of Clothes, and the strangeness of his Food, which
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>was only Herbs, he continu'd in good Health, and had time enough to lament their direful Providence. The Natives who were daily expecting another Ban∣quet, met with a disappointment: either their Cuostms, or the over-ruling Power of God, would not suffer them to destroy him, he continuing still in Health. There∣fore they resolve to sell him: his <HI>Arannia,</HI> or Master, was pretty free to Discourse him, which the Relator was capable of, being about 3 Years before in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> where he had learn'd the <HI>Tata</HI> Lan∣guage, which is easily attain'd, being com∣prehended in a very few words, and all the <HI>Negroes</HI> speak it. He began to Dis∣course his Master, to know <HI>the reason of their Cruelty,</HI> who told him, that <HI>he should rest himself contented, who if he were not Sick, should not have his Head cut off.</HI> In the Boat, which in the beginning they took with them, was a Musket sav'd of the 3 which was not discharg'd; which his Ma∣ster, some time after he had been with him, brought to him to know <HI>the use of it:</HI> he endeavour'd as much as he could to make him apprehend the use of it, but still they profest their ignorance: but they commanded and threaten'd him to shew the use of it. The fear of his Ma∣ster's Displeasure and their Inhumanity,
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>caused him to shoot it off; but the <HI>Negroes,</HI> which expected some delightful thing, were frustrated, and at the sudden noise and flash of Fire (which they very much dread) ran from him, and were greatly affrighted; but quickly after, hearing no more of that noise, they came up to him again, and commanded him to <HI>do the like:</HI> He told them <HI>he had not Powder, which was the cause of the noise;</HI> but this would not satisfie these <HI>Barbarians.</HI> He not being able to answer their expectati∣on, they concluded he was not willing, they proceed to threaten him, and were about to Murder him, had not his Master rescu'd him. Upon Discourse after with this <HI>Arannia,</HI> or Master, he began to under∣stand the reason of their barbarous deal∣ing with him and his Friends, he telling him <HI>that naturally the People were Civil and simply Honest, but if provoked, full of Revenge;</HI> and that <HI>this Cruelty was occasion'd by some unhandsome action of carrying a Native away without their leave, about a Year before; they resolving if any came ashore, they should never go off alive.</HI> He had not been above 7 Weeks in the Country, but his Master presented him to his King, whose Name was <HI>E fn-me,</HI> King of the <HI>Blackamoors,</HI> who immediately gave him to his Daugh∣ter, whose Name was <HI>Oni-jah,</HI> and when
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>the King went abroad, he attended him also as his Page, throughout the whole Circuit of his Dominions, which was not above 12 Miles, yet boasting extreamly of his Power and Strength, but glorying exceedingly that he had a <HI>White</HI> to attend him, whom he employ'd to carry his Bow and Arrows; at several places remote from the Sea-side, the People would run away from him for fear, others would fall down and seem to Worship him, and and use those actions as they do to their Gods. Their Pregress was never so long, but they could return home at Night, but never without a handsome load of a Cup of the Creature. During all the time of the Relater's servitude there, he never knew him go abroad and come home Sober. They drink of the best <HI>Palm-Wine,</HI> and another sort of strong Liquor, call'd <HI>Penrore.</HI> The Relater quickly knew how to humour this profound Prince, and if any of the Natives abus'd him, upon his complaint, he had redress, as once by striving with a <HI>Negroe,</HI> his Arm was broke, which by Providence more than Skill, was set again. After some Months, the King of <HI>Ca-al nanch,</HI> whose name was <HI>E-fn mancha,</HI> hearing of this beautiful <HI>White,</HI> courted his Neighbour Prince, that he would sell him to him; at length they
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>struck a bargain, and the Relator was sold for <HI>a Cow and a Goat;</HI> this King was a very sober and moderate Person, free from Treacheries and Mischiefs, that the other was subject unto; and he would of∣ten Discourse the Relater, and ask him of <HI>his King and Country,</HI> and <HI>if his Kingdoms and Dominions were as big as his,</HI> which were not above 25 Miles in length, and and 15 in breadth. He told him as much as his Understanding and Years made him capable of, keeping still in the bounds of Modesty, and yet relating as much as pos∣sible to the <HI>Honour and Dignity of his Sove∣raign;</HI> first informing him of <HI>the greatness of one of his Kingdoms, the several Shires and Coun∣ties it contained, with the number of its Cities, Towns and Castles, and the strength of each, the infinite number of Inhabitants, and valour of his Subjects.</HI> One of these Kingdoms was enough to amaze sufficiently this petty Governour, that he need not to mention any more of his Majesties Glory and Dig∣nity. It put him in to such a profound consternation, that he resolved to find out some way to tender his Respects to this mighty Prince, and no way could he find so convenient, as to tell the Relater, that <HI>if he could find but a passage, he would let him go to</HI> England, <HI>to tell his Majesty of the great Favour and Respect he had for him.</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>This did not a little rejoice our <HI>English-man.</HI> Withal the King told him, that <HI>he would send him a Present, which should be two Cabareets or Goats,</HI> which they do va∣lue at a very high rate; the King having not above 16 or 18. He tells the King, that <HI>the K. of</HI> England <HI>had many thousands of his Subjects that were under the Degree of Genlemen, which had a thousand of Sheep a∣piece; the Flesh of which, they valu'd at a very much higher rate than Goats.</HI> Tho' our <HI>English man</HI> liv'd very handsomely with this <HI>E-fn man-cha,</HI> King of the <HI>Ca-la-nanch,</HI> yet his desires and his hopes were still for his Native Country: At length he ob∣tain'd a Promise from his King, that <HI>the first</HI> English <HI>Ship that came into that Road, should have liberty to Release or Purchase him;</HI> this very much rejoic'd his Heart: Now he thought ev'ry day a year, till he could hear of, or see some <HI>English</HI> Ship arriv'd. Many times when he was alone, his Heart would be oppress'd with Sighs and Sob∣bings, when he thought of his Relations, and the comfortable Society that they had together; that it should be his sad Lot to be Captivated amongst barbarous Infidels. Oftentimes did he walk down to the Sea-side, sometimes with Hopes, sometimes with Fear, earnestly expecting the Wind of God's Providence to blow in
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>some <HI>English</HI> Ship thither: His often re∣course to the Sea-side was discern'd by one <HI>Ja-ga,</HI> a Wizard, and the chiefest in 3 or 4 Kingdoms there-abouts; they are Persons that the Natives give very much credit to, and on any difficult Occasion, run to them for satisfaction. The famous <HI>Delphiān Oracle</HI> was never had in greater Adoration, than the Prophetical Speeches of these <HI>Moorish</HI> Wizards. Tho' they have infinite numbers of them in every place, yet this <HI>Ja-ga</HI> had the most renown a∣mongst them; and one day he comes to him, and very kindly ask'd him, <HI>Why he so very often frequented that place?</HI> He told him, <HI>To see if he could discover any</HI> English <HI>Vessel to come in there:</HI> But he being not acquainted with his great Fame, askt him, <HI>When he did belive there would one come in?</HI> Not that he was willing to give credit to any of their Divinations, but supposing that he thereby should please him, and answer his expectation. <HI>Ja ga</HI> immedi∣ately told him, <HI>That the</HI> 15 <HI>day after an</HI> English <HI>Ship should come into the Road.</HI> Then he askt him, <HI>Whether that Ship should carry him away.</HI> To which he answer'd doubt∣fully, but told him, <HI>That he should be offer'd to the Master of the Ship, that they would not agree that he should come to Shore again, and he should not be Sold, but in a very
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>short time after, he should die for Grief.</HI> These 15 Days seem'd very long and tedious; many a look did he cast on the Sea with an aking Heart: The 14 Day he went to the highest Hill thereabout, but to no purpose, for he could discover no Ship: the next Morning he went again 2 or 3 times but saw none: about 2 or 3 Hours after came running into <HI>Efn-mancha,</HI> some of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and told him there was a Canoe coming, so they call'd our Ships; at which our <HI>English-man</HI> heartily rejoic'd, hoping then to be Releas'd forth∣with, yet durst not shew his joy for fear of Punishment, or of Death; for tho' he liv'd better now than with his first Ma∣ster, yet his Service was far worse than the Slaves in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and their Diet worse than Dogs-Meat; therefore had he cause enough of inward Joy; the Ship came immediately in, and he highs away pre∣sently to <HI>Ja-ga,</HI> to know if it were an <HI>English</HI> Ship, who resolv'd him that it was; it happen'd to be the St. <HI>Maloes</HI> Merchant, Capt. <HI>Royden</HI> Commander, who hasten'd to dispatch his Business, took in his <HI>Negroes,</HI> and was ready to Sail, and our <HI>English man</HI> heard never a word what should become of him, the King never offering to sell him; this put him on a resolution to en∣deavour to make an escape, and to that
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>end had prepar'd a piece of Timber which he had drawn near the Water-side, on which he intended to paddle to the Ship which then lay about a League from the shore. Just by the Sea-side; as he was a∣bout to Launch his little floating Stick, he espy'd a great <HI>Aligator,</HI> which will de∣vour a Man at a Mouthful; this made him alter his Resolution, and resolve ra∣ther to live with Inhuman Infidels, than to throw himself into so imminent a dan∣ger, which would have been little less than Self-murder. But the next day, which I may call a day of <HI>Jubilee,</HI> Al∣mighty God open'd the Heart of the King to let the poor <HI>English man</HI> go: He sent him in a <HI>Canoe,</HI> plac'd between a <HI>Negroe's</HI> Legs, with some others to guide this small Vessel, for fear he should leap over-board and Swim to the Ship. At a distance from the Ship he Hal'd her in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, which was no small cause of ad∣miration to those on Board to hear an <HI>English</HI> Tongue out of their <HI>Canoes:</HI> The <HI>Negroes</HI> gave him leave to stand up and shew himself to the Captain, to whom he gave an Account <HI>how four were left there, and only he preserv'd.</HI> It was a pretty while before they could strike a Bargain, tho' the Captain was resolv'd not to leave him behind. Several times the <HI>Negroes</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>padled away with their <HI>Canoe,</HI> resolving not to part with him; but what with his entreaties and promises, he persuaded them to the Ship again, and they deli∣ver'd him on Board for 45 Copper Bars and Iron Bars; each Copper Bar being a∣bout the bigness of a Youth's little Fin∣ger, the Iron Bars a little bigger. Now were his Joys compleated, he thought himself, as it were, <HI>caught up into the third Heavens;</HI> he could hardly perswade him∣self but it was a Dream or Vision, and that he did not really see <HI>English</HI> Faces, or embrace <HI>English</HI> Bodies. It was some time before he could throw himself at the Captains Feet, and acknowledge his in∣finite cause of Joy in himself, and <HI>thank∣fulness to him for his Deliverance from such a severe Captivity;</HI> that <HI>he that lately was a Slave to Infidels, that worship they know not what, should now see the Faces of Christians, and join with them in Worshipping the true God;</HI> and to him first he offer'd up the Sacrifice of hearty Thanksgiving, that had sent his Angel to redeem him from so cruel a Bondage. When he came on Board, his Hair was very Long, and his Skin Tawny (<HI>Malatto</HI>-like) having gone Naked all the time he was there, and fre∣quently anointing himself with <HI>Palm Oyl</HI> he look'd like a <HI>Tawny-Moor;</HI> but immedi∣ately
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>the Seamen aboard, with Christian-like Hearts, Apparell'd him. The Master commanded to hoist Sail, and having a fair Wind, they Sail'd to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where Capt. <HI>Royden</HI> was to tarry some time; but the Relator earnestly desiring to go to his Native Country, and his Ralations, got passage to the <HI>Downs,</HI> in the <HI>Katherine</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Capt. <HI>South</HI> Commander, which through God's Goodness, in a few Weeks arriv'd in the <HI>Downs,</HI> where the Relater was put on shore to his Uncle, Mr. <HI>Rich.

<HEAD><HI>The Relation of Dr.</HI> William Johnson, <HI>con∣cerning a most Remarkable</HI> Sea-Deliver∣ance; <HI>in his own words.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="27">27. We went aboard from <HI>Harwich,</HI> on <HI>Michaelmas-day;</HI> Sept. 29. 1648▪ in the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Ipswich, Daniel Morgan</HI> Master, and having a fair Wind, we set Sail; I being Sea-sick, went to Bed, but about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon, the Master of the Ship came into our Cabin with more haste than he was wont, which made me ask him <HI>whether all was well?</HI> Who like a tender-hearted Man, who is loath to tell his Dying Friend, that he is so nigh his end, reply'd <HI>all is well;</HI> yet
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>when I saw him shift himself with such haste, I rose from my Bed, and crawl'd upon the Deck, where I saw a sad specta∣cle, the Ship having sprang a Leak, or rather a Plank, was ready to sink, upon which, every Man was affrighted, <HI>one was at his Prayer, another wringing his Hands, a third, his Eyes shedding of Tears,</HI> when he had no need of more Salt-water; but af∣ter this, they fell to Work, but were bu∣sie in doing nothing: The Master's Mate, who went to search the Leak, told us with a sad Countenance, trembling Hands, gnashing of Teeth, a quivering Tongue, and words half spoken. <HI>That the Leak could not be stopt, and the Water came in so fast upon us, that we must perish in this noment.</HI> Upon which we presently cast out our Long-boat, and shot off 8 or 9 Guns to another Ship, who came out with us, to come to our Relief, then with some dif∣ficulty we all got into the Boat, and God be thanked, came clear of the Ship, whose Sails now lay flat upon the Water, and now we were rowing we know not whi∣ther, for the other Ship came not to our Relief, which made us have hard thoughts of them without cause, for we understood that both the Ship and all the Men pe∣rished in the same hour. Now were we without all hope, for it blew half a Storm,
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>and we were in a small Vessel, many Leagues from the shore, without Com∣pass, or Provision to sustain us, being starv'd likewise with Cold as well as for want of Victuals, having nothing in our Boat, but a small Kettle, which serv'd to cast out the water, and 3 Bags of Pieces of Eight, of 300 Pound Serling, which would neither feed us, nor keep us warm; in this distress we went to <HI>Prayers,</HI> and it pleased God to hear us, and send a Ship to us, even in the moment of Death, which we endeavour'd to come to, and he likewise to us, but the Storm was so great, we could not reach one another, tho' when it was dark, he hung out a Light, and we to let him know we were alive, order'd, that when a wave took us up, we should give a great shout, which we did so loud, that <HI>I helieve our Cry was heard to Heaven,</HI> for by God's miraculous Assistance, we got near the Ship, and soon after, all safe into it; the next day it blew fair for <HI>Norway,</HI> whither we were bound, and about 12 at Noon we saw the Coast, which being ragged, and full of Rocks, we resolv'd to stay till next Morn∣ing before we went in, and then sat down to Meat, and Eat very heartily being kindly entertain'd by the honest <HI>Norwe∣gian;</HI> about ten a Clock at Night, we laid
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>us down to rest, after having pray'd, and set our Watch, but immediately this our second Ship ran with full Sails upon a Rock, and gave so great a Crack as was able to awake the most dead asleep a∣mong us, and the Mariners cry'd out, <HI>Mercy, Mercy,</HI> it pleased God, that the Ship struck it self so fast in the clift of the Rock, that the former part of her stood firm, but breaking in the Storm, one of the Seamen leaped from the Bow of the Ship upon the Rock, with a Rope in his Hand, which was fasten'd to one of our Masts, and held it with so stiff a Hand, that another slipt down by it, and so all our Company that escaped, being 28 in Number, came safe to the Rock; I was the last that came down the Ship that way, for in that very moment she gave way, which the Master perceiving, who was still aboard, made lamentable moan to us to help him, which we en∣deavour'd to the utmost, but the Ship broke, and sunk immediately; there was this good Man, and four of the Mariners drowned; I saw the Master, with a Light∣in his Hand, fall into the Sea, the sad∣dest sight that I ever yet beheld in this World, and that which pierced my Soul, to see him that saved our Lives, lose his own: Now were we in the Dark upon
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>the Rock, but knew not where, our Feet being cut upon the sharp Stones. At length, we happen'd of a hole in the Rock, which which was a warm shelter against the Wind; and when Morning came, where we could see no Land, only had a glimps of the Coast of <HI>Norway,</HI> at a great di∣stance: We grew Hungry, but had no∣thing to Fish with, but our Arms, with which we drew up some small Muscles, and they we eat heartily, but we burnt with thirst, and <HI>I would have given all I had for a Draught of fresh Water,</HI> which would have been more welcome than the Gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI> tho' nothing is so mean in our esteem; but we were forc'd to drink <HI>Salt-water,</HI> which increased our Thirst; we now saw a Ship coming towards us with full Sails, and we <HI>wav'd our Hats at them,</HI> but they went off, and never came near us; we betook our selves to our old Remedy, <HI>Prayers;</HI> the <HI>Danes</HI> first singing one of <HI>Luther</HI>'s <HI>Psalms,</HI> fell to their <HI>Prayers,</HI> and I Pray'd as long as I was able to speak, and then laid my self down on the Rock, thinking I should rise no more in this World: But I overheard one of the Sea-men, say, <HI>Let us make a Raft, and venture to Sea, I had rather be Drown'd than lie here to be Starv'd;</HI> They all concluded of it, tho' dangerous, and the Sea having fal∣len
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>from the Rock, had left our Sails, Masts, and Anchors, with part of the Ship thereon, wherewith they soon made a slight Boat, and it being a great calm, the rest past through the Beaches with 4 Men in it, and had it touch'd only on them, they would have rent it in pieces, however through God's Goodness, they arrived safe in <HI>Norway,</HI> and return'd with several Boats, so that we came all of us once more to Land, and were entertain'd at an honest <HI>Lutheran</HI> Parson's House, where after we had continu'd for some Days with little Money and much Thanks we parted, and came to <HI>Frederick Stadt,</HI> where the People ran after us in the Streets, and with compassionate Eyes <HI>gave us what we wanted, without asking;</HI> from whence we went to <HI>Oftersondt,</HI> and there went aboard an <HI>English</HI> Ship, we had not been above 2 or 3 hours at Sea, but there was a sad distraction, the Mariners again crying for <HI>Mercy, Mercy,</HI> for we had al∣most fallen soul on a Rock under Water, which we did not spie till we were upon it, but by the Mercy of God, we Sail'd close by it, and yet escaped it, the least touch of it had been our ruine; about noon we came clear of all the Rocks on the Coast of <HI>Norway,</HI> and were Sailing for <HI>England,</HI> with a fair Gale of Wind. But
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>in this prosperity, another sad ancident befel us, this third Ship sprang a leak and began to swim within as well as with∣out, and we had no way to relieve our selves, but pumping (for the Leak could not be found) which we did day and night, for four or five days together, when it pleased God, we came safe, though in a great deal of danger, because of our rotten Ship, into <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road; for the wind being very high, had like to have driven us upon a <HI>Scotch</HI> Vessel, who cry∣ed out as well as we, but we happily mist him, and so safely arrived in <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Town, through the wonderful mercy of God. <HI>Deus Nobiscum.</HI></P>

The 8th we had the Wind at <HI>North West</HI> by <HI>West,</HI> we plied to Wind∣ward, and it blew very hard; the 10th we took two <HI>Reefs</HI> in our <HI>Topsails;</HI> the 12th we took in our <HI>Topsails,</HI> and <HI>Reefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Costs;</HI> the 13th about One in the Morn∣ing we <HI>Sprung a Leak,</HI> in so much that we were forced to set both our Pumps to Work, and bear away before the Wind; yet still the Water increased; and the 14th we cut our <HI>Main-Sail</HI> from the <HI>Yard,</HI> and let him fly overboard, the Weather being so excessive thick by reason of the
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>extraordinary much Snow that then fell, that we could not see the Land, nor any place where we could run our Ship A∣shore to save our Lives; The 15 in the Mor∣ning, about One of the Clock, by For∣tune, unexpected of us, before we saw any Land, we struck upon an Island, called by the <HI>Russes, Mussoves,</HI> lying in the <HI>Missen Gulf,</HI> which by the Miraculous hand of God <HI>we light on, and were all</HI> got∣ten well ashore; for as God of his wonder∣ful goodness so order'd it, we struck about High Water, and as the Water fell away, our Ship dryed, so that we got safe to Land without any harm; and if it had pleased God we happen'd ever so little, either to one side or the other we should have all perish'd among the Islands of Ice. When we got all ashore, we made us a <HI>Tent,</HI> and when it was Day, looking about us, saw something like <HI>Houses;</HI> so our <HI>Captain</HI> and a <HI>Dutch Merchant</HI> Passenger that we had on Board of our Ship, and our <HI>Doctor,</HI> went to see what they were, thinking to find some Inhabitants, but they could find none: then we went Aboard our Ship, and got all our <HI>Beef</HI> ashore that we could find, about <HI>One hundred Weight</HI> of <HI>Bisket Bread,</HI> which was all the <HI>Bread</HI> we could find; then we Calculated that our <HI>Beef</HI> at <HI>Four Pieces</HI> a day, would serve
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>us till the middle of <HI>May,</HI> and every Man <HI>one Bisket</HI> a Day; but that would last but a small time: Besides, we got ashore Three Boxes of <HI>Candles,</HI> which was a great comfort to us in our necessity, by reason we had not above <HI>Three hours Day.</HI> Then we got all our things we had saved to the House that we saw; and going a∣bout discover'd a great many Houses, and we went to them to see what we could find, expecting to see some People, but there was none but <HI>empty Cask,</HI> so we came home to the place that we had car∣ried our things to again; but, as God would have it, just against the House that we had taken for our Habitation, in the Snow we saw <HI>Two Cask,</HI> and we went and found them both full of <HI>Rye Meal,</HI> which was a Joy beyond measure to us in our Extremity; and then we found another <HI>Cask</HI> with a <HI>Kneading-Tub</HI> in it: <HI>Decem.</HI> the First, the <HI>Dutch Merchant,</HI> and Four more of our hands went out and took a <HI>Compass,</HI> and <HI>Provision</HI> with them, upon Discovery, hoping to see some bo∣dy to speak to, that we might know where we were, but they could find no Inha∣bitants, the Course they steered was <HI>S.

<PB N="100" REF="106"/>and at length came to the same place where they were when they first turned back; then they looked more earnestly upon their <HI>Compass,</HI> and found it unhung, they hung it, and came the direct way home again; but when they came in sight of a House that was about Two Miles off of our House, the <HI>Merchant</HI> and one more Travelling better than the o∣ther Three, went before, and promis'd them to make a Fire against they came; but the Weather being so severe, they were not able to come along, but were Starved with the Cold before they got up to us: So the Lord, of his great Mer∣cy, made Provision for us until the First of <HI>March,</HI> it being a <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> and we at our Devotion, one of our Boys being at another House Broiling of our Victu∣als, saw some Men upon the Island, he fell down, being much surpriz'd, but soon got up again, and run and told us; up∣on which we left our <HI>Prayers,</HI> and run to see what they were; our <HI>Merchant</HI> could speak the <HI>Language,</HI> which was the preservation of all our Lives, for other∣ways they would have Murther'd us for <HI>breaking down</HI> their <HI>Houses,</HI> and <HI>Eating</HI> their <HI>Provisions</HI> that we found upon the Island, for they would not be perswaded but we were <HI>Pirats</HI> and <HI>Robbers,</HI> by reason that

<PB N="102" REF="108"/>insomuch that they were 24 hours com∣ing over, when they came upon the said Island: But it pleased the Lord so to or∣der it, that after they had dragg'd us o∣ver Two small Islands of Ice, that as God parted the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> for the <HI>Children of Isra∣el</HI> to pass through, so he parted the <HI>Ice</HI> from us, insomuch that we got over in <HI>Six hours</HI> time, which the <HI>Russians</HI> told us was never so before. But when we came over we lay where there were 1000 Men a <HI>Fishing.</HI> The first Night: and the next Morning we hired <HI>Sledges</HI> to drag us to some place Inhabited: The Beasts that dragg'd the Sledges along they call <HI>Roeys,</HI> they are like Deer, but larger: We were forc'd to be Dragg'd, we could not Travel our Limbs were so disabled with the Cold be∣fore we got off the aforesaid Island: be∣sides the <HI>Snow</HI> was of such a vast thickness, and so hard <HI>Frozen,</HI> that we could find no Path, if we could Travel never so well, if the <HI>Shamake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> as they call them, had not shown us the way; the first Night of our Journey upon the Sledges our <HI>Carpenters Mate</HI> died, so we made a Hole in the Snow and put him in, and left him. Then our <HI>Captain,</HI> and the <HI>Merchant,</HI> and the <HI>Doctor,</HI> being but single in a Sledge, and we near double, went faster than us to the next Town to provide <HI>Victuals</HI> and fresh <HI>Sledges</HI>

We have the <HI>Dangers</HI> that occurred in the Voyage, and these are also carefully Com∣memorated (<HI>ver.</HI> 9.) <HI>Now much time was spent, and Sailing was now dangerous, because the Fast was already past:</HI> This was the yearly Fast of the <HI>Jews,</HI> on which the A∣tonement for all the people was made by the High-Priest, in the <HI>holy of holies;</HI> which day was the 10. of the 7th Month, (<HI>Lev.</HI> 16.29.) which partly agreed wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h our <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> in which time the Sea was not Sailed in by the Antients, until the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> because of the shortness of the days, and violence of the Tempests, they were prone to in those Parts; this is the sense of Interpre∣ters upon the place.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Dangers</HI> should be remembred, con∣sidering we may come into them again.

<P N="2"><PB N="110" REF="116"/>2. <HI>Dangers</HI> should be remembred with consideration to the Greatness of them great things should be remembred, a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, great Mercies, great Deliverances great Sins, and great Dangers. How should we think, O what a Danger was I in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this time by such a Storm at Sea! by such a Sickness ashore! not only my Life is danger? was I fit to die at such a time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had I gotten an interest in Christ, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had been cast away at such a time?

<P N="3">3. Dangers should be remembred with consideration to their Suddenness; how many times do they come suddenly upon us? As there is sudden Fear, so there is sudden Danger. <HI>When the Lord send the Winds out of his Treasury suddenly, and threatens Men at Sea with sudden destruction, when desolation seems to come as a Whirl∣wind,</HI> &amp;c.

<P N="4">4. We should think of our Dangers with consideration to the frames of our hearts; what frames of heart we were then under. 1. To the frames of our hearts when in our dangers. 2. The frames of our herats when brought from under them. 1. The frames of the heart when in and under them: were not you under great fears and hurries of Soul? it may be, not knowing how it would go with your Souls, if you had gone off the stage of this life at the present. <HI>David</HI> when he was in danger, took especial notice of the frame of his spirit; <HI>Innumerable evils have compassed me about.</HI> (Psal. 40.12, 13.) He was compass'd about on every side with danger; and how was it with him then? he calls to mind, <HI>Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not a∣ble to look up,</HI> (Psal. 57.7.)

<P N="2">2.

Thus also did <HI>David</HI> when brought out of danger; <HI>Thy vow are upon me, O God,</HI> &amp;c. and at another time <HI>The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> low,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and thou helpedst me,</HI> (Psal. 56.12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 13.)

<PB N="113" REF="119"/>the sense of them off our Spirits.</P>
<P N="5">5. We should remember our <HI>Dangers,</HI> with consideration to the <HI>frequency</HI> of them, how frequently we were in them. <HI>Paul</HI> re∣member'd this, <HI>in Perils by Sea often, in Perils by the Heathens,</HI> &amp;c. (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.26.) O how often have we been near Drowning, near Taking, near Sinking, near Dying, and yet God brought us off; these things we should call to mind often who go out upon dangerous Voyages, and often come home; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he oftner and more frequent our dan∣gers, the more should we think upon them.</P>

<P N="2">2. We should Remember our Delive∣rances, to have our Hearts raised up it gratitude, and thankfulness to God for them; Thus did <HI>David, I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in presence of all his people: I will take the Cup of Salvation, and will cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the Name of the Lord,</HI> Psal. 116.12, 13, 14. We are to remember to pay our Thank-offerings unto God, after our De∣liverance from God: What forget such a Deliverance as this? What, not be thank∣ful for such a Preservation as this?</P>
<P N="3">3. We should Remember our Delive∣rances, so as to endear our Hearts to God Thus we find <HI>David, I will love thee, O Lord▪ I will love the Lord dearly,</HI> (so the Heb.) <HI>The Lord is my Rock, my Fortress, and my Deliverer,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Psal.</HI> 18.1. O! now how should Souls, after their Deliverance, boil and burn in Love to God! How are we engaged to a Friend that is at any time but an Instrument in God's hand to De∣liver us? And shall we be endeared to the Instrument, and not to the Author. O! how was <HI>David</HI> endeared to God
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>when he said, <HI>He having Redeemed him, he would walk before the Lord in the Land of the Living,</HI> Psal. 59. <HI>ult.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. We should Remember our <HI>Delive∣rances</HI> to improve them in a way of acting Faith, when the next danger and straits come: <HI>I will remember thee from the Land of Jordan, from the Hill Missar,</HI> Psal. 42.6, 7. This was to encourage him from his former Deliverances in his future straits and exigencies. What, now distrust God, who hath delivered in Six Troubles, and now shall we give way to Unbelief in the Seventh? Did not holy <HI>David</HI> thus! <HI>He hath delivered me out of the Paw of the Lyon, and out of the Paw of the Bear, and he wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> deliver me out of the hand of the uncircumcised Philistine.</HI> Thus <HI>Paul</HI> remembers his De∣liverance from <HI>Nero. And I was delivered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of the mouth of the Lyon, and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work,</HI> 1 Tim. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.17, 18.</P>
<P N="5">5. We should remember our Delive∣rances, to be often inculcating, and im∣printing them upon our own hearts: A∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, when we receive them, they are a lit∣tle fresh it may be upon our spirits, but O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow soon do they die, because they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot written upon our hearts; they are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngraven there as a Man that would Re∣member a thing, beit a Notion, or an
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>Resolution, he will be often turning it o∣ver in his thoughts; Alas if we write o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Deliverances, Is it not in the Dust? where as we should write them in Marble: We should write them with a Pen of Iro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the point of a Diamond.</P>
<P N="1">1. We should commemorate our Dan∣gers with our Deliverances, because God gives them to that end. The Lord doth not give us our Deliverances to cast them at our heels, nor brings us out of our Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ers that we might forget them, as tho w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had never been in any of them. God ex∣pects that we should faithfully Registe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Record them; therefore it was a great. Provocation to the Lord, that the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> so soon forgot his works If you do but forget the kindness of Friend, you think it is disingenuous; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> O then, What is it to forget that God that hath delivered you out of six trou∣bles, and in seven troubles? God loves and expects his kindness should be kept upon Record,</P>
<P N="2">2. We should Commemorate our Dan∣gers and Deliverances, because it was free∣ly of his grace to bring us out of the on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and put us under the other; Is it not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his meer mercy that he rescu'd and pull'd us out of our dangers? Might not we else have been swallow'd up by them? And
<PB N="117" REF="125"/>may not we all say in this case, as the Psalmist in that? <HI>Had it not been the Lord who was on our side then, the waters had over∣whelmed us, the stream had gone over our Soul, then the proud Waves, had gone over our Soul,</HI> Psal. 124.4, 5. May not you who have been, so often deliver'd at Sea in imminent dangers sing this Song; What, and now forget such dangers? and cast behind your backs such Deliverances. Oh! the freer any favour is, the more it should be re∣membred; Doth God see any thing in us, or in our Families, more than others, to bestow such deliverances for? One Man goes to Sea, and he is taken; ano∣ther goes to Sea, and he is sunk; another goes to Sea, and he dies the Time of the Voyage; And why doth the Lord pre∣serve you? Is not this Free-Grace? not because you are more Righteous, but be∣cause he is more Gracious; And should not this be remembred?</P>
<P N="3">3. Our Dangers and Deliverances should be remembred, because God hath gracious ends and designs both in the one and the other; What ends hath God to bring us into dangers? 1. He by this hath an end and design to quicken us up to duty; it may be there may be some ommitted du∣ty; neglected duties often bring Men in∣to great and imminent dangers; it may be
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>a Person is convinced of the duty of Prayer, but it may be neglected; Oh then God will bring him into danger to quicken him to his duty; Oh, says God, <HI>In their affiction they will seek me early.</HI> The very Heathen Mariners called out for Prayer in time of danger. Observe it, that Persons convinced of duties, either Personal or Domestical, and yet neglect∣ed, God usually whips them to their Du∣ties, by one danger, affliction or another. The Proverb is good, <HI>if you wonld teach a Man to Pray, send him to Sea.</HI> 2. God by bringing us into dangers, hath a design upon us to convince us of sin; many Convictions have come into the Soul at this door; Dangers have often proved in∣lets to Convictions. Oh! What Convic∣tions have many poor Souls lain under while in danger, when it may be the dan∣gers have given them a view of Eternity; when Dangers have presented Death to the Man, and Conscience hath cried, <HI>Now thou art sinking, now there is but a step betwixt thee and Eternity, betwixt thee and and another World?</HI> Oh then what Con∣victions hath the Soul lain under? and yet it may be when the Danger is over, the Conviction is over too. Well, though we may forget all, yet God remembers all. 3. God hath a design upon us in
<PB N="119" REF="127"/>our Dangers, to prepare us for our latter end. The danger thou wert in, and have escaped, calls for thee to prepare for thy Death, which must certainly come to pass shortly. God by Dangers would have you prepare for Death: And Oh! What a cutting Consideration will this be when thou comest to die? that thou who hast been in so many dangers by Sea and Land, shouldst have no more learned to die, nor art yet ready to die. Alas, you escaped the last, that you might prepare for the next. 4. God hath a design upon our Graces by bringing us into dan∣ger; Danger is to evert and draw forth Grace. Thus the Disciples Dangers at Sea were to draw forth their Faith. Faith and Patience come most visibly upon the stage in times of most imminent Danger.</P>
<P N="5">5. God by bringing us into Dangers, hath a design upon our Souls; he some∣times by danger of drowning the Body, hath saved the Soul, and hath caused it to say, <HI>Periissem nisi periissem: I had pe∣rished, if had not perished.</HI> Some have escaped Shipwrack of Soul, by Shipwrack of Body; And shall we forget such Dan∣gers, when God hath such gracious de∣signs in them upon us;</P>
<P N="2">2. He drives on gracious ends and de∣signs in our <HI>Deliverances,</HI> And shall we
<PB N="120" REF="128"/>then forget them? <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He spares us, that we may account his long-suffering Salvation; he gives, by sparing of us, space to Repent; and Oh! What a dread∣ful thing is it not to remember where∣fore we are spared and delivered? <HI>He gave her space to Repent, but she Repented not,</HI> Psal. 56. <HI>ult.</HI> The Prisoner is Re∣prieved, that he might sue out his Par∣don, and will he forget the End for which he is Reprieved?</ITEM>

Men are not delivered from Dan∣gers to live to themselves, to live to their Lusts, to Drink, and Swear, and Rant, and Roar, as a great many poor Wretch∣es do. That say as they did. <HI>We are de∣liver'd to do all these abominations,</HI> Psal. 50.15.</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. God hath another End of Delivering of

Is it so that we are to Remem∣ber our Sea-dangers and Deliverances? then it is a word of <HI>Exhortation;</HI> be ex∣horted then to call to mind, and keep in mind, what God hath done for you; and in this Exhortation I address my self to Sea-faring Men, whose lives are a course and series of Wonders in their frequent Salvations and Preservations, (witness this Treatise) as you <HI>see the wonders of God in the Deeps, (viz.)</HI> The wonders of his Creation, so do you see the wonders of his Salvation: How of∣ten may <HI>Wonderful</HI> be Written upon the Head of Salvations that you are every Voyage receiving from God? you never go out, and come home, but God works <HI>Wonderfully,</HI> and appears <HI>Wonderfully</HI> for you; Is not he a Wonder-working-God for you every Voyage?</P>
<P>The <HI>Exhortation</HI> is to call to mind, and keep in mind, to Record and Register your Dangers and Deliverances, and not to do as <HI>Israel</HI> is said to do, who soon for∣got his Works. How often doth God bring this sin of theirs in one <HI>Psalm? They forgot his works, and the wonders he had shewed them, Psal.</HI> 106.13. <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.11.</P>
<P N="1">1. Keep them in mind, for they are wonderful Dangers and Deliverances;
<PB N="125" REF="133"/>They are Wonders, these are to be re∣membred. <HI>Marvellous things did he for them, in the sight of their Fathers,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>He divided the Sea, and caused them to pass through, and he made the waters to stand as an heap, Psal.</HI> 78.12, 13. And it is brought in again in that <HI>Psalm, They remembred not his hand, nor the day when God delivered them out of the hand of the E∣nemy,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.42. And in ano∣ther place, <HI>They forgot God their Savi∣our, which had done great things in Egypt, Wondrous works in the Land of Ham, Psal.</HI> 106.21, 22. This heightens the and sin exceedingly to forget such Great Wonderful Dangers and Deliverances.</P>
<P N="1">1. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Respect, they are often such as threa∣ten a sentence of Death to be executed upon you. May it not be said of poor Sea-men, as was of them; <HI>For we would not (Brethren) have you ignorant of our trou∣ble, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, inso∣much that we despaired of Life; but we had the sentence of death in our selves, that we should not trust in our selves, but in him that raiseth the dead, who delivered us from so great a Death, and doth Deliver,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.8, 9, 10. O how many Sea-faring
<PB N="126" REF="134"/>Men may say thus! <HI>Our Dangers have been such, as we have often despaired of Life; there hath been but a little betwixt us and Death; nay, betwixt us and Eternity;</HI> And shall we forget such dangers, when we have been so near death in them? As he said to <HI>David, As the Lord lives, there is but one step betwixt thee and death.</HI> O how often have you been near sinking, near drowning, and yet God hath then appeared for you, with an outstreached Arm, and in the Mount hath he been seen, And will you not remember this?</P>
<P N="2">2. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Respect, they are sudden and sur∣prizing, they are wonderfully sudden; threatned with nothing but present Death and Destruction? It may be said of Sea-men, as of those in <HI>Job, Snares compassed them about, and sudden fear trou∣bled them,</HI> Job 22.10. It doth not on∣ly trouble them, but all on a sudden trou∣ble them, before they know almost where they are (as we say;) We read of some whose Calamity shall come suddenly. <HI>Suddenly shall he be broken without Remedy,</HI> Prov. 6.15. O how terrible is such a case, or such a danger! And hath not God often threatened to make this your case and condition? O then do not forget such dangers that have so suddenly lookt you in the Face!</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="127" REF="135"/>3. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Respect, they are not Dangers in which your Bodies are concerned only, but they are Dangers in which your Souls are concerned; It is not only the danger of a Shipwrack'd Vessel, and a Ship-wrack'd Estate, and a Shipwrack'd Body, but a Shipwrack'd Soul. Here is the great danger, lest thou make a lost Voyage for thy Soul: If thou hadst di∣ed in such a Storm, or died in the Time of such a Voyage; Oh! What would have become of thy Soul, thy precious, thy immortal Soul? Hadst not thou died in a Carnal, in a Christless state and con∣dition? Had not they poor Soul perish'd to all Eternity, if thou then hadst mis∣carried? Wast not thou then a stran∣ger altogether to Christ, and a Work of Saving Grace upon thy Heart? Hadst not thou then the guilt of all thy sins upon the back of thy Soul unpardoned? And O what danger was this! And wilt thou forget such dangers?</P>
<P N="4">4. Your Dangers are such at Sea, as none but a God can deliver from; all your skill cannot; O, then is the great∣est Artist at his Wits end! The Psal∣mist tells us, (<HI>Psal.</HI> 107.27.) <HI>the Mari∣ners in their Storms, are at their wits end;</HI> (or as some read it) <HI>all their wisdom is
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>swallowed up, they know not what course to steer,</HI> (the <HI>Dutch</HI> Annorators carry it,) <HI>Now their very Pilots are at a loss: Now all their courage cannot contribute to their delive∣rance, though men of the greatest natural cou∣rage and magnanimity in the world: Yet now their Hearts melt because of trou∣bles;</HI> as it said of the Mariners in <HI>Jonah's</HI> Ship, <HI>The Mariners were afraid.</HI> O now, when Death and Eternity, the Grave and Judgment to come looks them in the face! Then they are <HI>Magor-Missa∣bibs,</HI> terror to themselves, and to all a∣bout them; O then, the danger is such, it must be only the finger of God that can help! I have heard of a Ship in <HI>Yar∣mouth</HI> Road, that in a great Storm, they feared the Anchor would come home, and the Master discoursing with a Youth in the Ship, that God had begun lately to work some Convictions upon, <HI>O says he,</HI> Master, <HI>if God do but lay a Finger upon one Strand of the Cable, it will hold;</HI> and in the morning many Ships were lost near them, and there was but one Strand in the Ca∣ble left. O the singer of God only can save in some dangers. It was a good say∣ing of a Godly Commander of a Ship in imminent danger, <HI>None now but that God that saved the Children of</HI> Israel <HI>at the Red Sea, can save us out of this distress;</HI> and as soon
<PB N="129" REF="137"/>as he had said it, the Wind altered, and saved them; And will you forget such dangers as none but a God can save from?</P>
<P N="5">5. Your dangers at Sea are such as many thousands have perished in; how many have gone to Sea, that never returned more? that have been swallowed up in the belly of the great Deeps? How many have perished by the Sword at Sea? how many by violent Storms? and that God should put a difference betwixt you and others, and you should forget it, this ex∣ceedingly heightens and aggravates the guilt. How many have lost their lives? how many have lost their limbs? and yet in such dangers God hath brought you off; this is never to be forgotten.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your dangers are not only wonder∣ful, but your deliverances are so too, and therefore should be remembred. There is never a deliverance, but you may read a wonder in it; so many deliverances and salvations at Sea, so many wonders. God saves you in a miraclous way.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is not this a wonder, that persons of such great sins and provocations, should be persons of such great salvations and preservations? that such as sin every Voyage, nay, it may be at an high rate sin every Voyage, should be saved and de∣livered at such an high rate every Voyage?
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>is not this a wonder, that Men of such sins, should be men of such salvations? that men that sin against these salvations, should not have these deliverances shorten upon them. Oh what a wonder is this! We should wonder if a person should be con∣tinually disobliging any of us, and yet we should be still heaping up kindnesses up∣on him: This made the Prophet <HI>Ezra</HI> say, <HI>Shall we again break his Commandments, after such deliverances as this?</HI> O do not you pro∣voke the Lord every time that you go out and still he delivers you, still he returns you to your Relations, to visit your habi∣tations in peace! and is not this a wonder?</P>
<P N="2">2 Your deliverances are wonderful, if you consider your deliverances are great deliverances. We read of such; <HI>And the Lord saved them with a great de∣liverance;</HI> or with a great Salvation. Thus said <HI>Sampson, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy Servant,</HI> (Judg 15.11.) Now any great transacti∣ons are remembred and recorded. Your deliverances are great, if we consider these things;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They are commanded deliverances by the great God; his word of command brings all our deliverances about, whether at Sea or Land. Which made the Church in distress pray, <HI>Thou art my King, O God, command deliverances
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>for</HI> Jacob, (<HI>Psal.</HI> 44.4.) He commands every thing tending to deliverance at Sea; in order to deliverance, he com∣mands the Winds; <HI>He maketh the Storm a Calm,</HI> (Psal. 107, 29.) He also commands the Seas; <HI>He says to the proud Waves, So far, and no farthar.</HI> You read of a decree set to the Sea, to command the Sea, that it cannot pass; <HI>Though the Waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not pre∣vail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it,</HI> (Jer. 5.22.) It is the great God only that rides Lord Admiral at Sea, to command the Seas and the Waves thereof. God is said to shut up the Sea with doors, and set bars upon it, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stay'd,</HI> (Job. 38.8, 11.) <HI>Xerxes</HI> presum'd he could tame the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> for attemp∣ting his Bridge of Boats; but all this was in vain, this is a flower in God's Crown alone, to command the Sea. Your deli∣verances are a fruit and effect of God's commanding Power, therefore great.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They are great deliverances, as they are the curious workmanship (as I may call them) of the Attributes of a great God. Deliverance is said to be wrought for us, it is the handy work of God; <HI>If God will work, who can let?</HI> (as the Prophet saith, <HI>Isa.</HI> 43.13, 14.) And he seems to speak
<PB N="132" REF="140"/>it upon the account of the deliverance of his People: <HI>For your sake I have sent done to Babylon, and have brought down all their Nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in their ships.</HI> In every deliverance there is the excellent work of the Attributes of God; we may in such a deliverance say, <HI>Here is the Power of God,</HI> and <HI>here is the Wisdom of God,</HI> and <HI>here is the Wisdom of God,</HI> and <HI>here is the Love of God,</HI> and <HI>here is the Faithfulness of God,</HI> &amp;c. For as God in the confounding of the Languages at <HI>Babel,</HI> said, <HI>Go to, let us go down,</HI> (as if he directed himself to his glorious Throne) <HI>Come, let us go down.</HI> Gen. 11.7. (Or as some take it of the Trinity, as in the Creation.) So when God sends us deli∣verances in our distresses, he sets his Attributes at work; <HI>Go Power, go Mercy, go Love, go Faithfulness, go and act your respective parts in this deliverance;</HI> and must not this be then an excellent and curious Piece that God's Attributes brings forth?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They are great deliver∣ances, if we consider the great sins and provocations they come over the heads of, the great unworthiness of the received, heightens much the mercy and favour received; the reason why per∣sons do not greaten their deliverances, is because they do not greaten their sins, in
<PB N="133" REF="141"/>the deep sense and aggravations of them. O such a Soul would say, as <HI>David, is this the manner of Men?</HI> O God, is not this a great deliverance for such a great sinner to receive?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They are great Deliverances, if we consider the time and season of their coming in; as this Deliverance of the Ships Company where <HI>Paul</HI> was, <HI>it was when all hope of being saved was taken away;</HI> and so were many of the Deliverances, mention'd in this Treatise. So <HI>Peter</HI>'s Sea-Deliverance, <HI>when he began to sink, Christ stretched forth his hand immediately;</HI> he was now sinking and going, but see how ready Christ was to save; <HI>He stretched forth his hand and caught</HI> Peter, (<HI>Matth</HI> 14.28, 29, 30.) Our sinking time, is <HI>Jesus Christ's</HI> sav∣ing time. <HI>In the Mount is the Lord seen;</HI> our extremity is Gods opportunity; and are not then the great deliverances never to be forgotten?</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. They are great deliverances, if we consider they are not only Deliver∣ances of the Bodies, and Ships, and Estates sometimes, but Souls; and where the Ship is lost, and the Estate is lost, yet for the life to be saved, and the Soul deliver∣ed, is a very great Deliverance; a Re∣prieve when a Prisoner is under the sen∣tence of Death, is a great Mercy: O when God Reprieves a poor Prisoner, this is some Deliverance; we read of
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>some Deliverance God gave to <HI>Israel</HI> in the days of <HI>Shishak;</HI> a Reprieve is some Deliverance, but if it end in suing out the Prisoner's Pardon, then it is a great Deliverance. If it be such a Deliverance in a Storm at Sea, as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> had from a Sickness at Shore, <HI>Thou hast deliver'd me in love to my Soul, and cast all my Sins behind thy back,</HI> (Isa. 38.) This is a double De∣liverance, and sure such Deliverances as these are worth Recording; These are to be written in Marble and not in Dust, with the Pen of Iron, (as the Prophet says) and not with the point of a Dia∣mond.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="3">3. Your Deliverances are wonderful, if you consider the many thousands that have perished in less Dangers to an Eye of Reason; they are distinguishing Deli∣verances, and therefore wonderful; hath God dealt with all Men that go to Sea as with you. Have not thousand perished by the Sword at Sea in bloody Engage∣ments? Miscarried at Sea in dreadful and terrible Storms; Hath not the Sea been a Sepulchre for thousands? Are not there Millions of the Dead that the Sea must one Day give up, and yet you Delivered, and yet you Spared? O what distinguish∣ing Mercy is this! And shall this be for∣gotten by you? Should not you keep Re∣cords
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>of distinguishing Mercy? How ma∣ny sunk sometimes, and perished by your sides? How many that went out with you that never Returned? One taken, and another left; one sunk, and ano∣ther saved.</P>
<P N="4">4. Your Deliverances are Wonderful, if you consider the way that sometimes God takes to bring them about; O what strange ways doth God take to Deliver, when he hath a Mind to Deliver; some∣times he brings down to the <HI>very Gate of the Grave,</HI> he brings to the Doors and Bars of the Sea, and then shuts these Doors; as <HI>Job</HI> speaks, He brings to the next Door to perishing, and then he De∣livers; <HI>Master save me, or I perish;</HI> and then he lends an Arm, witness many of these Deliverances here mention'd. Some∣times he doth it by strange means; low and contemptible, as the poor Man that we Read of, that Delivered the City, (<HI>Eccles.</HI> 2.15.) sometimes by unthought of and unexpected means, as he that Re∣lieved Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> as this Story men∣tions, he was a <HI>French</HI> Pyrate. As that Ship I have heard of, that when she sprang a Leak, and they all had like to have perished, and all on a sudden the Leak stopt, and they knew no Reason, but when they came into the next Port
<PB N="136" REF="144"/>to search her, there was a great Fish ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wrought himself in the Leak, that they were glad to cut him out; was not here a Miraculous Deliverance? That <HI>Jona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> should be swallowed up by the Whale, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what a Miracle was this! And so he was preserv'd! And how have some been sa∣ved by sudden shifts of Winds when near sinking and perishing? These are to be remembred to the Lord while you live Oh! Methinks this one Motive should set on the Exhortation, if I should use no more, to Remember your Dangers and your Deliverances.</P>
<P>But secondly, another Motive is this, to Remember your Dangers with your Deliverances; this will in your great Distresses and Extremities, contribute some Hope to you; to read over your Register, your ancient Records, how good God hath been at such a time, and such a time; how seasonably he stept in and Delivered in such a strait and such a strait; Oh then says the Soul, why then should I Despair, and cast off all Hope now? Hath not he appeared and saved in Deaths often before now? For past Experiences are good supports for Hope in present Exigencies and Extre∣mities; thus <HI>David</HI> argues, when at a great strait, <HI>Thou hast delivered me, and
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>wilt deliver me;</HI> and thus St. <HI>Paul, Thou hast delivered me, and wilt deliver me. Haman</HI> found this a good way to Remember the Years of the Lord's Right Hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. Remember your Dangers and De∣liverances, for God records them; they are filed up by God, and he will mind you of them another Day if you forget them now; he keeps his Journals and Records; he hath his Book of Remem∣brance of your forgotten Mercies, as well as your forgotten Sins; God will one Day read over all those Deliverances you have forgotten; <HI>Oh poor Soul! Did not I deliver thee in such a Danger, in such a Distress, in such a Death, when there was no Hope, when there was no Help, yet all this hast thou forgotten; forgotten'thy Mercy, and forgotten the God of thy Mercy;</HI> Oh! will not this sting you to the Heart, when God shall cause your strangled, and murdered Mercies to walk in your Consciences; when he shall give them a Resurrection there?</P>
<P N="4">4. Motive to Remember your Dangers and Deliverances: The Vows of God are upon you; Oh! What did you say to God in the day of your Distress and Calamity? <HI>Lord if thou wilt appear, and be a present Help in time of Trouble, it shall never be for gotten, it shall he Remembred
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>to the Lord as long as we have a Day to Live</HI> but when God brings poor Souls off many do not only forget their Vows but deny them: In Ancient times it was usual in imminent Dangers, whether a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sea or Land to make Vows; We read that <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Mariners, they vowed Vows (<HI>Jonah</HI> 1.16.) <HI>David</HI> did thus, <HI>Thy Vows are upon me, O God! I will render praises unto thee,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Psal.</HI> 56.11. (and in ano∣ther place) <HI>I will pay thee my Vows, which my Lips have uttered, and my Mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble,</HI> (Psal. 66.13, 14.) But because this is so ordinary to make Vows at Sea, and break them a Shoar, let me enlarge a little upon it. 1. Why should you forget your Vows after your Deliverances? They were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ash Vows, there might have been some Excuse if you had made them rash∣ly, you might then have had a Plea, for saying it was an Error; but in times of Distress Men are serious, when Death and Eternity are set before them, and they upon the brink of another World; dare you Sinners rashly Vow, in this day of your Distress; O no, your Consciences will bear Witness against you, that you were in Sober-sadness at that day. 2. Why should you ferget your Vows after Deliverances, for God will require Pay∣ment?
<PB N="139" REF="147"/>Nay, this is not only the Reason why we should not forget to pay, but why we should not delay the Pay; <HI>When thou vowest a Vow to the Lord thy God, thou shouldst not be slack to Pay it, for the Lord thy God will require it, yea, will surely require it of thee, and it would be Sin in thee,</HI> (Deut. 23.21.) Take it for granted he will do it, so as to call to a Payment Day, he will demand it, he will send unto you a Summons to Pay the Vows you made to him in the day of your Distress. Oh! How often is Con∣science, God's Officer, that he sends to you to demand Payment? O says Con∣science, <HI>Sinner, Pay what thou owest to the God of thy Deliverances; it not he a God to whom thy Vows must be Performed?</HI> 2. He will require it, so as to punish the Non∣payment; and so requiring is here ta∣ken, and in many other places, the Lord, doth very often severely punish Vow∣breaking; breaking of Vows doth cause God often to destroy the works of your Hands. Say not before the Angel, <HI>It was an Error, wherefore should God be angry at thy Vows, and destroy the works of thy Hands?</HI> (Eccles. 5.4, 5.) Some Expositors refes this to the Priest, before whom the Sin of rash Vows was to be confess'd; others carry it to Christ, the Angel of the Co∣venant,
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>who sees through all our subti Excuses and Equivocations, and punishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them. O God is angry when Men go so flatly against their Vows; O ther God is angry, and destroys the work o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Hands, <HI>viz.</HI> disappoints their En∣deavours, and denies their Success.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> to forget your Deliverances and Dangers, is the greatest Ingratitude and Unthankfulness in the World; hath God given you so many wonderful De∣liverances, so many miraculous Preser∣vations, to be buried in the Grave of Oblivion? Will you Murder your Mer∣cies and then bury them? It is common∣ly said, <HI>Murder will out.</HI> Murdered Mer∣cies will one day make terrible work, in walking in your Consciences.</P>
<P>The next Observation is this, That Salvations and Deliverances many times are not sent until Persons be left Help∣less and Hopeless. I shall give you a touch of this. <HI>Now all hope of being saved was taken away, no small Tempest lay upon upon them; now they were gulft in Despair of ever coming off with their Lives:</HI> Yet this often is the condition of Nations, Ship-Companies, and Persons, where God intends to save and deliver. The Proofs of the last Observations about Dangers and Deliverances being record∣ed
<PB N="141" REF="149"/>and remembred, proves this also. Thus was <HI>Peter</HI> saved, the Disciples saved, when just at sinking.</P>
<P>But why doth God stay so long before he sends Deliverances and Salvations? 1. Because he delights to draw forth a Spirit of Prayer; if Men will not Pray when sinking, when Drowning, when Dying, they will never Pray. O see how <HI>Jonah</HI> Prays in his distress: <HI>And</HI> Jonah <HI>Prayed to the Lord out of the Fishes Belly, and said, I cried by reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the Belly of Hell cried I, and thou heardest my Voice,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>When my Soul faint∣ed within me, I remembred the Lord; and my Prayer came in unto thy Holy Temple,</HI> (Jonah 2.1, 2, 3, 7.) O Sirs, God loves Prayer so well, that he stays with his Deliverances, that he might sue them out by Prayer. <HI>Out of the Depths have 1 cried unto thee,</HI> saith <HI>David,</HI> (Psal. 130. 1.) Driven to it by deep and bottomless straits, into which I am plunged. And it seems to be an Illusion to Mariners, in their Distresses and Dangers of being Shipwrackt, crying unto the Lord. What, will any Man perish, and never Pray for it? Die, and never Cry for it? What, and not say as <HI>Peter</HI> did, <HI>Master, save me, or I perish?</HI> What was it that did draw
<PB N="142" REF="150"/>forth Prayer in many of these Distressed Ship Companies (in this Treatise menti∣oned) but their Dangers and Distresses?</P>
<P N="2">2. God doth not bring our Deliver∣ances and Salvations until we be Hope∣less, because he will exercise his Peoples Graces: Therefore the Disciples were not saved until the Ship was full, that their Graces might be exercised. O now is a time for Faith and Patience to be exerted, there is nothing more pleasing unto God, than to see how poor Souls exercise their Graces, when they are re∣duced to Extremities; God hath a great revenue of Glory arising to himself, out of the exercise of his own Grace in the Souls of Believers. O how doth Faith act its part when Mercy and Deliverance is delay'd! It was one of <HI>Luther</HI>'s won∣ders, <HI>to believe for Mercy that was long de∣lay'd.</HI> It is an high exercise of Faith, to look up to God long together, and no∣thing to come. To say with the Pro∣phet <HI>Jonah, I will look again towards thy Holy Temple,</HI> (Jonah 2.4, 8.) And with the Prophet <HI>Isaiah, Tho' he hide his Face from the House of</HI> Jacob, <HI>I will wait upon him, and look for him,</HI> (Isaiah 17.) What tho' thou be as the Prophet's Servant, who went down to the Sea to look, and he said <HI>Master, there is nothing.</HI> But what
<PB N="143" REF="151"/>then? Doth he give over? O no, <HI>the looks again;</HI> and <HI>the seventh look he saw he Cloud.</HI> So Faith in its exercise, will look again and again, and never give over, until it espie the Mercy coming upon the wings of Prayer. So might I add of Patience; O how doth it act its part while the Deliverance tarries; it quietly waits for the Salvation of God; saying, as <HI>David, My Soul waits for the Lord, more than they that watch for the Morning,</HI> (Psal. 130.6.) The Soul of the Believer possesses it self in Patience until the Mercy come.</P>
<P N="3">3. God doth not bring our Salvations and Deliverances, until we be brought to an Extremity; because they are most prized and welcomed then. O now Deliverance will be prized: The longer that a Mercy tarries, the more welcome it is when it comes: God loves to make all his Mercies welcome to us. O how welcome is Life, to a Person under a Sentence of Death! O how welcome is a Discovery of the love of Christ to a poor Soul, that hath long groaned under the burthen of unpardon'd Guilt! O how welcome was the Prodigal's Father's House, when he had so long been star∣ving in the Fields, with his Husks, a∣mongst the Swine!</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="144" REF="152"/>4. Because God will have all his Sal∣vations and Deliverances look like his own Hand and Arm, his Arm brings Salvation with him; he will have the print of his own Hand upon it, that poor Sinners may say, <HI>This is the Finger of God, the doing of God, and it is marvellous in our Eyes.</HI> Alas, Men would attribute it to themselves, if Salvation did not come in such a way, <HI>when all hope of be∣ing Saved is taken away.</HI> Oh! Every thing is beautiful in its Season; is not Salvation and Deliverance now in Sea∣son? Now they begin to Despair, as to probable or visible hopes. O now, God works like himself, now he appears in a Deliverance to be God; which set the Disciples a wondering, <HI>What manner of Man is this, that the Winds and the Sea obey him?</HI> Mark 4.41. And at another time, when he deliver'd his Disciples at Sea, and calmed the Winds, then they that were in the Ship Worshipped him, saying, <HI>Of a truth thou art the Son of God,</HI> 14.32, 33.</P>
<P N="5">5. Because he will by such Salvations set off his Love to poor Souls: Was not the Love of Christ set off highly, in ta∣king that Season to save the Ship <HI>when it was full; to save them when they were sinking;</HI> is not that great Love, that steps
<PB N="145" REF="153"/>forth to save in an Extremity? O what Love was this, to save this Ships Com∣pany, <HI>when all hope of being saved was ta∣ken away?</HI> Love always chuses the fittest times to appear and evidence it self.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Because he will have his Deli∣verances, endearing Deliverances to Souls. O how doth such an appearance of God, at such a time, endear the Soul of the Receiver. Therefore, saith <HI>Da∣vid, I will love the Lord,</HI> (or love the Lord dearly) <HI>my Rock, and my Deliverer,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But I will proceed to give you also a∣taste of the <HI>Application,</HI> and not to be large, because I have been large upon the former, which was mainly intended.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then learn we hence, that God may for gracious ends, known to himself, delay a Mercy or a Deliverance, and yet fully intend to give in that Mercy. <HI>Ja∣cob may wrestle all Night, and yet be put off; but in the break of Day the Mercy comes.</HI> The Woman of <HI>Canaan</HI> may cry to Christ for her Daughter, and at present be put off, yet at last she shall carry it. The belie∣ving Soul may not have the <HI>Dove</HI> come with an <HI>Olive-Branch</HI> in her Mouth until Evening. Christ's manifesting of his Love to poor Souls, is called his Supping with them; <HI>And I will Sup with you:</HI> Now Supper comes not up till Evening.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="146" REF="154"/>2. Learn we hence, that God's timing our Deliverances and Salvations, is best for us; his Time is the best Time. Our time is always ready, (but saith Christ) <HI>My time is not yet.</HI> If we had our Mercies in our time, we should not see that beau∣ty in them; for every thing is beautiful in its Season: And God chuses the fittest Seasons to send them, because he will put a beauty upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Learn we hence, <HI>that no case is de∣sperate to God, tho' it be so to Man:</HI> One would have thought this a desperate case, <HI>in such a Storm, lightning the Ship,</HI> the <HI>cast∣ing cut of the Tackling of the Ship, neither Sun nor Stars appeared, and all hope of be∣ing saved taken away;</HI> yet all this was but desperate to them, it was not so to God: Now their Extremity becomes God's op∣portunity, and he takes this Juncture of time to appear in. Thus <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 42. 7, 8. all God's <HI>Waves and</HI> God's <HI>Billows had gone over him;</HI> a desperate case! Yet God (then he believes) <HI>would command his loving kindness in the Day-time, and the Song should be with him in the Night.</HI> Faith is an excellent Grace at a desperate stand.</P>
<P N="4">4. Learn we hence, that <HI>God's Thoughts are not as our thoughts;</HI> when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> think of nothing but sinking and perishing, then doth God think of Saving and Delivering.
<PB N="147" REF="155"/>They thought <HI>all hope of being saved was taken away,</HI> but God looks through the Storm and Cloud, and Comforts them. As the Disciples, when they thought it had been a Spirit in their Storm that ap∣peared to them; <HI>No,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>be not afraid; be of good chear, it is I,</HI> Mark 6. 50, 51, 52.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Is it so, that the Salvations and Deliverances that many of us have, are not until we are brought to Extremities? Then it is a word of <HI>Exhortation;</HI> Then look up to God in the most desperate Case, when you know not what to do in your Storms at Sea, in your Straits at Land. O then let your Eyes be up unto the Lord; you see how many Delive∣rances have come down in Extremities, as answers to Prayer. O Pray hard; let going to Sea, being in Storms at Sea, being brought to Extremities at Sea, learn you to Pray.</P>

<HEAD>A Prayer in a Storm.</HEAD>
<P>O LORD our God, thou hast com∣manded us in the Day of Calamity to call upon thy Name, and thou hast promised to hear us; Lord, I fly unto thee, who art a sure refuge; thy Flood∣gates are opened, and the Floods lift up their lofty Waves. But thou, O Lord most high, art mightier than the Noise of many Waters: yea, than the mighty Waves of the Sea: Thou canst in a mo∣ment, if it stand with thy Divine will and pleasure, rebuke the Winds and the Sea, and turn this Storm into a Calm.</P>
<P>I know I justly deserve to be cast a∣way, and utterly to be rejected by thee; but Lord save us, or else we perish; ac∣cept of my unfeigned Sorrow for all my Sins and Transgressons, and endue me with a stedfast resolution to forsake them; be merciful unto us, O God, be merciful unto us, and Save us from Perishing in these deep Waters; O refresh us with thy Mercy, and that soon, lest we go down ito the place of silence, O com∣fort us in this great distress, that though the Sea rage and swell, our Hearts may be quiet and still in this time of our dis∣consolation.</P>
<P><PB REF="163"/>And as I earnestly desire to be pro∣tected from this great Peril and Danger which now terrifies us, so I earnestly beseech thee, that thou wilt for ever fill my Heart with such an awful dread of thy Name, and praise thy power in the great Congregation; awake my dull and drowsie Soul, from the sloth of Sin, and renew a right Spirit within me; fill me with the Gifts of Graces of thy Holy Spirit, that I may Live the Life of the Righteous, and never forget thy Loving∣kindness; save us now from Death, I be∣seech thee, from the Merciless Waves who are now ready to swallow us up, and bring us home in safety, for thy Son Jesus Christ his sake, our only Lord and Saviour. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Thanksgiving after a Storm.</HEAD>
<P>I PRAISE and Glorifie thy Holy Name, O Lord, for all thy Mercies and Blessings vouchsafed unto me, espe∣cially for this thy last great Deliverance, wherein I was incompassed in that wide Ocean, whom thou hast set Bounds and Limits to; if thou, O Lord, hadst not been on my side, the Sea had swallowed me up quick, and I had gone down into the deep silence; but thou hast been my God and my Deliverer, and hast put a new Song into my Mouth, a Song of Praise and Thanksgiving unto my God.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, O Lord, that thou art the God of all the Earth, and of them that remain in the broad Sea: Blessed for ever and magnified thy Name that thou hast not cast me out of thy sight, nor turn'd thy Mercy from me; I have escaped the raging Sea, and the Noise of the proud Waves have done me no Harm, if thy Almighty Providence had not protected me, Streams had gone over my Soul. But the Stormy Wind and T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpest I have narrowly Escap'd, the Storm is ceased, and I am safely De∣livered.</P>
<P><PB REF="165"/>And now what shall I render to thee, O Lord, for this, and all other thy great Benefits? I will offer up unto thee the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving, and will pay my Vows I so solemnly made unto thee, when I was in trouble; I will evermore remember, that my help is in the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth, and that thou art that God that can and will deliver me; let this thy Mercy and Loving kindness never depart my Me∣mory, but let me Praise thy Goodness, and Sing of thy Power, unto my Lives end. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An Hymn of Praise and Thanksgiving after a dangerous Tempest.</HEAD>
<P>O Come, let us give thanks unto the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever.</P>
<P>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; let the redeemed of the Lord say so; whom he hath delivered from the merciless rage of the Sea.</P>
<P>The Lord is gracious and full of com∣passion: flow to anger, and of great mercy.</P>
<P>He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: neither rewarded us accord∣ing to our iniquitirs.</P>
<P>But as the Heaven his above the Earth: so great hath been his mercy towards us.</P>
<P>We found trouble and heaviness: we were even at deaths door;</P>
<P>The Waters of the Sea had well nigh cover'd us: the proud waters had nigh gone over our soul.</P>
<P>The Sea roared and the stormy wind lifted the waves thereof;</P>
<P>We were carried up, as it were to Heaven, and went down again into the deep: our soul melted within us, be∣cause of trouble;</P>
<P>Then cried we unto the Lord: and
<PB REF="167"/>thou didst deliver us out of our distress.</P>
<P>Blessed be thy name, who didst not despise the prayer of thy servants; but didst hear our cry, and hast saved us.</P>
<P>Thou didst send forth thy command∣ment: and the windy storm ceased, and was turned into a calm.</P>
<P>O let us therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the wonders that he hath done, and still doeth for the children of men.</P>
<P>Praised be the Lord daily; even the Lord that helped us, and poured his benefits upon us.</P>
<P>He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation; God is the Lord by whom we escaped death.</P>
<P>Thou Lord hast made us glad through the operation of thy hands; and we will triumph in thy praise.</P>
<P>Blessed be the Lord God; even the Lord God who only doeth wondrous things.</P>
<P>And blessed be the name of his Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> for ever; and let every one of us say, Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son; and to the holy Ghost;</P>
<P>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be; world without end. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Prayer to be said before a Fight at Sea against any Enemy.</HEAD>
<P>O Most powerful and glorious Lord God, the Lord of hosts, that ru∣lest and commandest all things; Thou sittest in the throne judging right: and therefore we make our address to thy di∣vine Majesty in this our necessity, that thou wouldst take the cause into thy own hand, and judge between us and our enemies. Stir up thy strength, O Lord, and come and help us; for thou givest not always the battel to the strong, but canst save by many or by few, O let not our sins now cry against us for ven∣geance, but hear us thy poor servants beg∣ing mercy and imploring thy help, and that thou wouldst be a defence unto us against the face of the enemy. Make it appear that thou art our Saviour and mighty deliverer, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
