<P>REMARKS ON THE USES OF THE DEFINITIVE ARTICLE IN THE GREEK TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT; CONTAINING MANY NEW PROOFS OF THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST, FROM PASSAGES, WHICH ARE WRONGLY TRANSLATED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH VERSION.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE first part of the following Remarks on the uses of the definitive article in the Greek Text of the New Testament was printed in the second Fasciculus of the Museum Oxoniense. A Supplement to the Re∣marks was at the same time promised to be published in the third Fasciculus of the Museum. But as many learned friends concurred with the Editor in thinking that the Remarks contain a very valuable accession to the evidences of Christ's divinity, he was unwilling to detain the Supplement, which exemplifies the Rules of the Remarks, any longer from the publick, and has there∣fore prevailed on Mr Sharp to permit him to publish it with the Remarks. He earnestly recommends them both to Mr Wakefield's most deliberate consideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To Mr Sharp's Remarks and Supplement he has subjoined a plain historical proof of the divinity of Christ founded on</HI> Christ's own testimony of himself attested and interpreted by his living witnesses and enemies,
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>the Jews,—<HI>on</HI> the evidence of his trial and crucifix∣ion, <HI>and on</HI> the most explicit declarations of the A∣postles after the Resurrection of Christ. <HI>What ap∣peared to him to be a substantial and unanswerable ar∣gument, he has, in this little exercise on the subject, en∣deavoured to render an easy and popular proof, of our Saviour's divinity. It was printed separately for the use of the unlearned part of his parishioners, and is subjoin∣ed to this treatise for the convenience of other unlearned readers, and such as may not have much considered the subject.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE REV. MR — CONCERNING THE USES OF THE GREEK ARTICLE <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Old Jewry, London</HI> <DATE>10th <HI>June,</HI> 1778.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I look upon the date of your last oblig∣ing letter, I am much ashamed that I have so long neglected to acknowledge the receipt of it. The truth is, I began a letter a few days afterwards; but recol∣lecting that I had written on the same subject (viz. the use of the Greek article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and copulative <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) to a very learned friend, at a great distance in the coun∣try, I was willing to wait for his answer, lest it should oblige me to make any alterations in my rules; and so, indeed, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proved; for he objected to my first rule (as it was then stated) and has cited several ex∣ceptions to it, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thought sufficient to set it entirely aside: but this, I am convinced, is going too far, and would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> injury to truth. The use there∣fore
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>which I have made of my friend's objections, has been, to correct my rule, and add to it such li∣mitations as might include the several exceptions, cited by my learned friend, as well as others, that are similar to them.</P>
<P>The waiting for my friend's answer and the neces∣sary corrections in consequence of it, together with a variety of other engagements, has prevented me from complying with your request so soon as I could have wished; but I shall now submit to your consi∣deration and candour, the rules in question; and beg that you will be pleased to favour me with whatever examples may occur in the course of your reading, either as exceptions to invalidate the <HI>first rule,</HI> or as proofs to establish and confirm it. The reasons of my recommending the first rule more particularly to your attention, is, because it is of much more con∣sequence than any of the rest, as it will enable us (if the truth of it be admitted) to correct the translation of several important texts in the present English ver∣sion of the New Testament, in favour of a fundamen∣tal article of our church, which has, of late, been much opposed and traduced, I mean the belief that our Lord Jesus Christ is truly God.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>When the copulative <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> connects two nouns of the same case [viz. nouns (either substantive, or adjective;
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>or participles) of personal description respecting office, dignity, affinity, or connection, and attributes, properties or qualities good or ill] if the article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or any of it's cases, preceeds the first of the said nouns or participles, and is not repeated before the second noun or participle, the latter always relates to the same person that is ex∣pressed or described by the first noun or participle;</HI> i. e. it denotes a further description of the first named person, as—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Matt. xii. 22. And again <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 2 Cor. i. 3. This last sentence contains two examples of the first rule. See also in 2 Cor. xi. 31, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp;c. Also in Eph. vi. 21, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Also in Heb. iii. 1, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. See also in 2 Pet. ii. 20,—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. And again in 2 Pet. iii. 2,—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And again in 2 Pet iii. 18,—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Also in Philippians iv. 20,—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. In Rev. xvi. 15,—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. And in Col. ii. 2,—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The distinction of persons mentioned in this sentence is pra∣served by the insertion of the article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> before <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which had been omitted before <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. And in 1 Thef. iii. 11,—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>This solemn ejaculation for the divine direc∣tion is addressed jointly to the God and Father, and to our Lord Jesus
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This text is clearly a supplication to Christ for providential assistance; and being addressed to him <HI>jointly</HI> with God the Father, most certainly amounts to <HI>supreme worship,</HI> because the direction of Providence belongs to God alone: so that a prayer for it addressed to Christ, were he merely a minister or dispenser of God's provi∣dence and not also truly God, would be utterly unlawful; and more especially so, if such an inferior dispenser of providence (one that was not truly God) was to be addressed jointly with the heavenly Father; for that would be blasphemous.</NOTE>; (so that here is good authority for offering up prayers to Christ, which some have lately opposed) and the distinction of the persons is preserved (as in the last example) by again inserting the article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> before <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which had been omitted before <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The apostle James also used the same mode of expression—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. James i. 27. And there are at least a do∣zen other places, viz. (Rom. xv. 6.1. Cor. xv. 24. Gal. i. 4. Ephes. v. 20. Col. i. 3, and 12
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Some copies have not the words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in this twelfth verse, but only <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in which last case this verse affords an example only of the second rule.</NOTE> and iii. 17. 1 Thes. i. 3. 1 Thes. iii. 13. 2 Thes. ii. 16. James iii. 9. Rev. i. 6.) wherein <HI>"the God and Father"</HI> is mentioned exactly according to this rule; and there is no exception or instance of the like mode of expression that I know of, which necessarily
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>requires a construction different from what is here laid down; EXCEPT the nouns be <HI>proper names,</HI> or <HI>in the plural number;</HI> in which cases there are many exceptions; though there are not wanting exam∣ples, even of plural nouns, which are expressed ex∣actly agreeable to this rule.</P>
<P>As the examples which I have annexed to my first rule consist of texts, wherein the sense is so plain, that there can be no controversy concerning the par∣ticular persons, to whom the several nouns are ap∣plicable, it will be thought, I hope, that I have al∣ready cited a sufficient number of them to authen∣ticate and justify the rule. There are several other texts wherein the mode of expression is exactly simi∣lar, and which therefore do necessarily require a construction agreeable to the same rule, though the present English verson has unhappily rendered them in a different sense, and has thereby concealed from the mere <HI>English</HI> reader many striking proofs <HI>con∣cerning the Godhead</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Col. ii. 9.) of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The rules which follow are intended only to illustrate the <HI>particula∣rity</HI> of the several sentences which fall under <HI>the first rule,</HI> by shewing in <HI>other</HI> sentences, the different senses that are occasioned by adding, omiting, or repeating the article as well <HI>with</HI> the copulative as <HI>without it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE END OF THE RULES.</HEAD>
<P>The various uses of the article and copulative, expressed in the five last rules and their exceptions, must amply illustrate, to every attentive reader, the difference and particularity of those sentences which fall under the first and principal rule; and therefore I may now proceed with more confidence to point out several important corrections that ought to be

<P><HI>Of sentences, which fall under the FIRST RULE, and are improperly rendered in the English version.</HI></P>
<P>Example I. 2 Pet, i. 1.—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. As the Article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is not repeated before the next descriptive noun <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, it is manifest that both the nouns are to be referred to one and the same person; and therefore, in order to turn it into an intelligible English phrase, the <HI>proper name</HI> to which the <HI>two descriptive nouns</HI> re∣fer ought to be placed first, as <Q>By the righteous∣ness of Jesus Christ OUR GOD, and our SAVIOUR.</Q> Among the various readings collected by Curcel∣laeus, it appears, that, in some copies, the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was not repeated after <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and I have by me twen∣ty different editions (including those of Erasmus, Stephens, Dr. Mill, Bengelius, &amp;c.) which follow that reading; viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; in which case a literal rendering into English will sufficiently express the sense of the Greek, without transposing the <HI>proper name,</HI> viz. <Q><HI>Through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI></Q> The sense and purport, however,
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>is exactly the same in both the readings, and, in the old English editions, has generally been expressed in the terms required by my first rule; viz. <Q><HI>In the righteousness that cometh of oure God and Saviour Je∣su Christ</HI></Q> (fol. edit. 1549.)—<Q><HI>Through the righ∣teousnesse of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI></Q> (12mo edit. 1595.)—<Q><HI>By the righteousnesse of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI></Q> (4to edit. 1599.) —<Q><HI>The righteousness of Jesus Christ our God and Sa∣viour.</HI></Q> (margin of the folio, edit. 1611.) And even in the margin of our present version, the pro∣per reading is inserted, <Q><HI>of our God and Saviour,</HI></Q> manifestly referring both titles to one person. The learned Beza also remarks on the words of this text, <Q><HI>Ista necesse est conjunctim legamus, quia unicus est ar∣ticulus, ut copiosius diximus</HI> Tit. ii. 13. <HI>Itaque conti∣net etiam hic locus manifestum divinitatis Christi testi∣monium.</HI></Q> The two nouns are referred to Christ also in the Syriac version. There seems, therefore, to be ample authority for my first rule.</P>
<P>Exam. II. Titus ii. 13.—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. In some few copies a comma is inserted between <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but with∣out authority. The abovementioned note of Beza upon this text, is too long to be inserted here at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ength, and therefore I must refer you to the author himself. He insists, however, that these two titles do not refer to two distinct persons, because the article <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> omitted before the second. In the present Eng∣lish
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>version it is rendered <Q><HI>the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ:</HI></Q> but so great is the difference between the idiom of the Greek tongue, and that of the English, that a <HI>literal translation</HI> will not always express the same sense, without some little transposition in the order of the words; and therefore, though the pronoun <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is placed after the two descriptive nouns that are ap∣plicable only to <HI>one</HI> person as they are expressed in <HI>the Greek,</HI> yet the rendering of the said pronoun <HI>in English</HI> ought to be PREFIXED to the said descriptive nouns, in order to express the <HI>same sense</HI> in a proper English phrase; as, <Q><HI>the glorious appearing of</HI> OUR <HI>great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI></Q> This is the rendering of the learned Hugh Broughton, accor∣ding to a printed English bible, corrected <HI>with a pen,</HI> in my collection. It might, indeed, be <HI>literally</HI> ren∣dered without transposition of the pronoun, viz. <Q><HI>the great God and Saviour</HI> OF US,</Q> instead of <Q>OUR <HI>great God and Saviour;</HI></Q> but the latter is more agreeable to the general mode of expressing that pronoun in English. Thus Christ is not only enti∣tled <HI>God,</HI> but even the <HI>"great God,"</HI> according to the plainest grammatical construction of the text; and indeed, if we duly weigh the evidence of his being really <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and <HI>one with the Father,</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: the plural verb <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (<HI>"we are"</HI>) marking the plurality, or distinction of more person than one, as much as the noun <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> marks the <HI>unity</HI> of

And as each person is God, it follows, that each must be the great God: Theophylact bears an explicit testimony to this conclusion in his commentary on St. Paul's epistle to Titus, ii. 13. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (says the learned and venerable commentator, exultingly, on the authority of this passage) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Now what be∣comes of their objections, who degrade the dignity of the Son, not allowing him even the name of God?

His words are: <Q>Here it deserveth to be noted, that it is highly probable, that Jesus Christ is here styled <HI>the great God;</HI> first, because in the original the article is prefixed only before the <HI>great God,</HI> and therefore seems to re∣quire this construction, "the appearance of Jesus Christ the great God and our Saviour." Secondly, because as God the Fa∣ther is not said properly to <HI>appear,</HI> so the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> never occurs in the New Testament, but when it is applied to Jesus Christ, and some coming of his; the places in which it is to be found, being only these, 2 Thess. ii. 8. 1 Tim. vi. 14.2 Tim. i. 10. and iv. 1.8. Thirdly, because Christ is emphatically styled <HI>our hope, the hope of</HI> our glory, Col. i. 27.1 Tim. i. 1. And lastly, because not only all the ancient commentators on the place, do so interpret this text, but the Ante-Nicene fathers al∣so; Hippolytus (Antichrist. sect. 64.) speaking of "the ap∣pearance of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ; and Clemens of Alexandria (ad Gent. p. 5, 6.) proving Christ to be both God and Man, our Creator, and the author of all our good things, from these very words of St. Paul. <HI>Vid. tract. de vera Christi deitate,</HI> p. 44, 45.</Q> Hammond also in his literal marginal ver∣sion translates <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, thus, "the appearance of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.

<P>In the common english version the sentence is rendered <HI>"no whoremonger &amp;c." hath any inheri∣tance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God.</HI> As if two persons had been mentioned in the original text; but as the part of the sentence, above cited, is the generally approved reading of the printed <HI>greek copies,</HI> and as this reading is confirmed by the Alexandrian MS. and by all other greek MSS. of known authority, it affords an unquestionable proof against <HI>the apostacy of the Socinians</HI> in their <HI>denial of divine honour to our Lord the Christ, or Messiah,</HI> who, according to the idiom of the greek Tongue, is in this text expressly entitled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, "GOD," though the proof does not appear in the english version. Let it be remarked that the two substan∣tives
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>of personal description <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> are joined by the copulative <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and that the article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> pre∣ceeds the first, and that there is no article before the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, whereby, according to <HI>the first rule,</HI> both titles are <HI>necessarily</HI> to be applied to <HI>one</HI> and the same person, and (if literally rendered in eng∣lish) should be—"hath not inheritance in the king∣of <HI>the Christ and God.</HI>" But this <HI>literal</HI> rendering does not sufficiently express the necessary doctrine of the greek, that the <HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>also God,</HI> and there∣fore, to help the english idiom, and to accommodate the rendering more strictly to the true meaning of the greek, the name of <HI>Jesu,</HI> which is necessary to be <HI>understood,</HI> might very fairly be inserted in <HI>italies,</HI> or between hooks, to supply the necessary sense of the greek;—as "in the kingdom of (Jesus) the Christ and God:" or else to be rendered —<HI>"in the kingdom of Christ (even) of God"</HI>— as recommended in the first example.</P>

The difficulty therefore of rendering the common reading (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) without supposing this addition of EN to be understood before <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, proves that the reading of the Alexandrian MS. in this text is really to be prefered, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>

<P>This, in the common english version, is render∣ed (very erroneously) as if two distinct persons were mentioned, viz. <HI>"according to the grace of our God, and the Lord Jesus Christ."</HI> But if two distinct persons had really been intended to be expressed as (by innumerable examples of the grammatical construction of sentences for the accurate distinc∣tion of persons peculiar to the greek tongue, used in the greek testament, from which the preceeding rules were formed) may be demonstrated, the arti∣cle would have been repeated (according to the sixth rule) after the copulative and before the se∣cond substantive <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. For it is manifest that the
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>insertion of the comma, in some greek copies, after <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is a modern interpolation; because the expe∣dient of breaking sentences into small divisions or particles by commas, to preserve the necessary dis∣tinctions, was not anciently used (nor likely to have been used) by the ancient writers of the greek tongue, who were accustomed to much more accurate distinctions in their various pecu∣liar modes of grammatical expression, specified in the six preceding rules.</P>
<P>Whole sentences are, indeed, distinguished in the oldest greek MSS. by a single point placed at their end, sometimes towards the top of the line, sometimes in the middle, and sometimes towards the bottom; but apparently no distinction of <HI>time</HI> has been intended by any of these three different modes of placing the point, for they are all placed indiscriminately to the most obvious and full ter∣mination of sentences; and therefore we may be assured that, in all these three different modes of placing them, they were originally intended only as <HI>periods</HI> to conclude the sentences; so that when we find them in the place of commas, to distinguish merely the parts or particles of a sentence, there is great reason to suspect that they have been the ad∣ditions of later times.</P>
<P>In the Alexandrian MS. the text before us is awkwardly divided by one of these points, placed after the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which point, for the reason
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>before given, must necessarily be deemed a <HI>period,</HI> and which did not exist in the original text of the sacred penman.</P>
<P>The intention of the transcriber or interpolator by adding this point to the text (for it cannot justly be attributed to the original writer) has been probably to make a distinction of persons; as if <HI>two</HI> persons had been named in the text instead of <HI>one,</HI> in like manner as the comma is added after the word God, in the english version, <HI>without any authority.</HI></P>
<P>But the necessary grammatical construction of the whole sentence taken together detects the in∣terpolator, and demonstrates the absurdity of sup∣posing, that any such point ever existed in the ori∣ginal text, because the words, which are severed by the supposititious period, cannot form a grammati∣cal sentence (according to the ordinary modes of expression used in the greek tongue) by themselves alone; so that the obvious sense of the context demonstrates their necessary connection with the preceding words <HI>in one entire sentence;</HI> and de∣monstrates also, at the same time, the ignorance and fallacy of the interpolator, who attempted to make two sentences of it by inserting a full period.</P>
<P>If literally rendered, it ought to be—<Q><HI>according to the grace of the God and Lord of us Jesus Christ;</HI></Q> but, more in the idiom of our own language, it might be justly rendered, <Q><HI>according to the grace of
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>Jesus Christ our God and Lord.</HI></Q> In either way the necessary doctrine of <HI>our Lord's divine nature,</HI> manifestly intended to be expressed in the original, is duly retained in the proposed version.</P>

<P>In the greek of this text, as it is commonly printed, the article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is repeated before <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which, so far, affords an excuse for the present english version in placing the comma after the word God, to denote <HI>two</HI> distinct persons, according to the sixth rule; but in the Alexandrian MS. and several other old copies the article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is <HI>not</HI> repeated after the copulative before <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, so that the expression is exactly similar to the declaration of our Lord's <HI>divine nature</HI> by the same apostle in the preced∣ing example, viz. I. Tim. v. 21. In some printed editions the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is also omitted, but in the Geneva edition of 1620, with Scaliger's Notes, the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is inserted, and the article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> omitted, whereby the title <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (God) must necessarily be construed in such a manner that it may be clearly understood in all versions to be expressly applied <HI>to Christ,</HI> as it really is in the original. The tran∣scriber or interpolator of the Alexandrian MS. however, being aware of this doctrine, has endea∣voured to pervert it, by adding a full period after
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But this <HI>period</HI> is unquestionably supposititious, because the words before and after the period are <HI>not two distinct sentences,</HI> but obviously, portions only of <HI>one entire sentence,</HI> which must ne∣cessarily be construed together, according to the ordinary rules of expression in the greek tongue, as I have remarked on a preceding example, whereby a second substantive of personal descrip∣tion, <HI>without an article before it,</HI> joined by a copu∣lative to a preceding substantive of the like na∣ture, and in the same case, <HI>with an article before it,</HI> must necessarily denote a farther description of the same person, expressed by the first substantive, (whenever there is an article before the first sub∣stantive and none before the second) so that the insertion of the <HI>period</HI> in the Alexandrian MS. af∣ter <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is utterly vain, because the <HI>copulative</HI> suffici∣ently proves the <HI>connection</HI> of the two substantives in one clear sentence, and the omission of the article before the second substantive induces the necessity of applying the same grammatical construction whereby alone the due distinction of persons is so peculiarly maintained in the greek tongue, and <HI>not by points.</HI> The text should therefore be rendered, —<Q>I charge (thee) therefore, before the God and Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</Q> or rather (to render the doctrine more obvious in the english idiom)—<Q>I charge (thee) therefore, before Jesus Christ the God and Lord, who shall judge the quick and
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>the dead, &amp;c.</Q> And thus the texts in the two last examples will perfectly accord as the uniform ex∣pressions of the same apostle, asserting, in both, the <HI>divinity of his Lord and Saviour,</HI> by whom he had been personally summoned to bear his testimony to the gentiles, as being an eye and ear witness of his <HI>glorious majesty.</HI></P>
<P>Our Socinian Sadducees, who have impiously en∣tituled our Lord <HI>"a mere man,"</HI> and <HI>"nothing but a man,"</HI> and <HI>simple human nature,</HI> will not be able to digest this necessary doctrine, until they humble themselves to receive instructions from the holy scriptures.</P>

<P>The present version of these words, in the eng∣lish testament, is—<Q>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</Q> This text (though the next in order, according to the usual mode of arranging the books of the new testament) has al∣ready been produced as the second example in the preceding letter.

<PB N="33" REF="38"/>or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. On which it is necessary to observe that the same remarks are obviously applicable to this super∣fluous and absurd addition of the point, or <HI>period,</HI> that I have made on the texts, II.

For as the proper effect and purposes of <HI>periods</HI> is to separate words into <HI>distinct sentences,</HI> it is obvious that the words, which follow the suppo∣sititious period in this text, are incapable of a gram∣matical construction without reference to the preceding words, connected by the <HI>copulative;</HI> and therefore the <HI>note</HI> of <HI>separation</HI> (a period) cannot possibly have been intended by the inspired writer.

<P>I am persuaded that our modern Socinians would not have made so much clamour about <HI>the necessity of a new translation,</HI> had they been aware that a more close and literal rendering of the ori∣ginal text (even in passages which had escaped their calumnious charges of <HI>corruption,</HI> and their arrogant attempts at imaginary <HI>correction)</HI> must necessarily cut up their favourite system by the roots.</P>

<P>This text, though <HI>the eighth</HI> in order, according to the proper order of the books, was <HI>the first</HI> ex∣ample cited in my letter; and I have only to re∣mark farther, that the Alexandrian MS. perfectly agrees with the present common approved reading of the greek text.

<P>The Rev. Mr Cruttwell has remarked (in his useful edition of the english bible with Bishop Wilson's notes) that the words rendered in our present version, viz.—<Q><HI>of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ</HI></Q> were rendered—<Q><HI>of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ</HI></Q> in the versions of Wiclif, Cover∣dale, Mathews, Cranmer, in the Bishops (bible) (the) Geneva, (the) Rhemish, (bibles) and by Dod∣dridge, Westley, Scattergood, and Purver; which is altogether a noble testimony of both ancient and modern times against the <HI>Socinian impiety.</HI> The <HI>eng∣lish</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>reader should undoubtedly be informed of the true meaning of these words in a proper <HI>english</HI> idiom, as,—<Q><HI>Through the righteousness of Jesus Christ our God and Saviour:</HI></Q>—which is agreeable to a literal rendering into latin by the late learned Dr Thomas Mangey, prebendary of Durham, viz. —<HI>"Jesu Christi Dei et servatoris nostri."</HI></P>

<P>I made a transcript of this text, several years ago, from the Alexandrian MS. which I copied or ra∣ther <HI>drew,</HI> letter by letter, in size and shape as exactly as the eye could discern. In this transcript the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is omitted, as in the MS. but I did not, at that time, perceive that there was any point or mark after the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and I was there∣fore, much surprized, afterwards, in comparing the said transcript, with the elegant edition of my late very worthy and respectable friend the Rev. Dr Woide (who printed a copy of the new testa∣ment from the Alexandrian MS. with new types in imitation of the letters of the MS.) to find that he had inserted a point, in his new edition, after the
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. I was very consident that I could not discern any such point, when I examined the MS. and yet, as I entertained the highest respect and esteem for the veracity and accuracy of Dr Woide (of which he was, indeed, truly worthy) it was necessary to have this matter properly ex∣plained; and I was rendered perfectly aware by Dr Velthusen's account of his examining an an∣cient MS. that the feint lines and marks in the very old MSS. are liable to bear different appear∣ances, according to the different degrees of light in which they are seen.</P>
<P>I therefore took the first opportunity, afterwards, of going once more to examine the MS. and on a more close inspection, I perceived, indeed, the <HI>feint</HI> mark which occasioned Dr Woide's insertion of the period, in his edition; but being afterwards assisted by the worthy librarian the Rev. Mr Har∣per, in a still more attentive and accurate exami∣nation of the mark with a magnifying glass, I was satisfied that it had not been intended for a period, but only for a short <HI>line of connection,</HI> because it is nearly three times as long as it is broad.</P>
<P>But if any person, from the authority of Dr Woide's edition, should be still inclined to suppose that it is really <HI>a point,</HI> I must request them care∣fully to consider what I have before remarked on the fourth, sixth and seventh examples in this tract, respecting the addition of <HI>points</HI> in greek manu∣icripts;
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>and also, concerning the more accurate modes of Grammatical distinction in the greek tongue, which rendered the smalier points, or <HI>par∣ticles of time</HI> (such as semicolons and commas) abso∣lutely unnecessary in the <HI>greek scripture;</HI> and, in addition thereto, let him observe, particularly on the text before us, that a point in that place, after <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (in the middle of the sentence, between the accusative noun and verb) is utterly inconsutent with grammar and common sense; and though the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, has been omitted in the Alexandrian MS. (perhaps for the same reason that some men would wish to prove the insertion of the point after <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) yet, happily, neither of these altera∣tions would at all affect, or injure the manifest testimony of the apostle Jude, <HI>to Christ's almighty power and divinity,</HI> for—<Q><HI>the only potentate and Lord of us Jesus Christ,</HI></Q> is equivalent to a full declaration of <HI>Christ's Divinity,</HI> as well as of his <HI>almighty power;</HI> and with respect to the insertion of the <HI>supposed point,</HI> they must perceive, if they duly consider the text, that the words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> cannot (consistently with the necessary gram∣matical sense of the greek, and the usual modes of expression, or idiom of that language) be separated either by points or construction, so as to be applied to two different persons, because the article is <HI>not</HI> repeated after the copulative, before <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: so that <HI>Christ alone,</HI> was unquestionably that—<HI>"only poten∣tate,"</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>or <HI>sovereign Lord,</HI> who was denied by the <HI>lascivious persons,</HI> against whom the apostle Jude bore testimony of their <HI>reprobacy,</HI> and of their having <HI>denied the Lord</HI> who had <HI>redeemed them.</HI> Dr Hammond's rendering of the text before us, may, therefore, be conscientiously maintained, viz. <HI>"and our only master God and Lord Jesus Christ,"</HI> making (says he)—<HI>"those three the several attri∣butes of Jesus Christ."</HI> But as the doctor has been pleased to add, that—<Q><HI>This interpretation proceeds upon that way of punctuation, which is ordinarily retained in our copies, there being no comma after</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</Q> I am obliged to protest against <HI>that reason, for the other reasons</HI> already given; and to insist, that the grammatical construction of the greek text is, of itself, our sufficient and best warrant to justify that <HI>literal rendering.</HI></P>
<P>But the applying to Christ this <HI>supreme</HI> title, —<HI>"the only potentate God"</HI> (and, also in a former text, the <HI>supreme</HI> title of—<HI>"the great God"</HI>) may perhaps induce some persons to conceive that this grammatical system of construction, if admitted as a rule, for all texts, in which the same mode of expression renders it applicable, will sometimes prove rather too much, and may be liable to fa∣vour a modern sect of <HI>Unitarians,</HI> who have adopt∣ed the <HI>Sabellian</HI> notions of the late Baron Swe∣denborg, and who assert, that—<Q><HI>Jesus Christ is the only God;</HI></Q> that is, they understand this in so
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>peculiar a sense, that they do not seem properly to acknowledge the <HI>personality</HI> of <HI>the holy spirit,</HI> any more than a very opposite sect of <HI>Unitartans</HI> do, the modern Socinians, who impiously assert (in the opposite extreme to that the of <HI>Swedenborgians</HI>) that <Q><HI>Jesus Christ was a mere man, and nothing but a man,</HI></Q> according to one of their teachers, and —<HI>"simple human nature,"</HI> according to another: and some of them have even presumed to charge the members of the church of England with ido∣latry,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This unjust charge of <HI>idolatry</HI> against the unquestionable prin∣ciples of the <HI>ancient catholic church,</HI> prosessed by the <HI>church of Eng∣land,</HI> affords a notable skreen to the <HI>Latin</HI> church, by indiscrimi∣nately confounding all the due distinctions, whereby a charge of <HI>idolatry</HI> is applicable; and this should teach us to be aware of what we should have to expect on the removal of all tests and restraints from such indiscriminate teachers; and, likewise, from all other sec∣taries (as much as from the <HI>pontifical hierarchy,</HI> seated on the <HI>throne of the dragon</HI>) who do <HI>not</HI> regulate their faith and practice by the plain doctrines of the holy scriptures.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since I wrote the above remark, respecting the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Arians,</HI> a more striking accomplishment of the prophecy, re∣specting the <HI>fallen star that opened the bottomless pit,</HI> has occurred to me, in the character of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> archbishop of Constantinople, and metropolitan of the greek church, whose doctrine was, in effect, still <HI>"more Unitarian than"</HI> that of <HI>Arius;</HI> for the consequences of his denying the miraculous birth of our Lord, and asserting that —<HI>"Christ born of the Virgin Mary, was not the son of God;"</HI> must necessarily be, that he was—<HI>"a mere man,"</HI> and —<Q><HI>nothing but a man,</HI></Q> according to the openly declared notions of our modern Socinians, which, in this point, is strictly <HI>Mahometan!</HI> With this false and <HI>antichristian</HI> doctrine <HI>"the third part of the rivers and fountains of waters"</HI> (viz. the sources of <HI>the nations</HI> and the <HI>people</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Empire, the <HI>third</HI> great monarchy) was <HI>embittered</HI> and prepared for the <HI>scorpion</HI>-like scourge of <HI>mahometan</HI> tyranny.</P>
<P>On account of this blasphemous doctrine, <HI>Nestorius</HI> was deposed (by the judgement of a great counsel of his <HI>peers</HI> the <HI>christian bishops</HI>) from his dignity as <HI>archbishop</HI> of the greatest city (at that time) in christendom, and from being <HI>metropolitan,</HI> as it were, of the <HI>Greek Empire;</HI> (the <HI>third</HI> great monarchy) and, therefore, he might truly be said to have <HI>fallen</HI> from the highest elevation of ecclesiastical dignity; so that no prophetical type could more amply prefigure this rejection, than—<HI>"the falling of a flar from heaven,"</HI>—the hea∣ven or <HI>firmament</HI> of the then amply <HI>established</HI> episcopal authority throughout the Roman empire. And the <HI>Unitarian</HI> doctrine of this <HI>fallen star</HI> (I mean <HI>Unitarian</HI> in the <HI>Mahometan</HI> and <HI>Socinian</HI> sense of that term) seems also to have been the <HI>very "key"</HI> whereby <HI>"the bottomlels pit"</HI> was opened to let out the noxious and diabolical vapour of <HI>Mahometanism,</HI> for it is really <HI>the leading,</HI> and first incul∣cated tenet in all the public professions of that baneful heresy. And it is remarkable that a <HI>Nestorian</HI> monk, <HI>Sergius,</HI> professing the same blasphemous doctrine (this—<HI>"key of the bottomless pit"</HI> forged by <HI>Nestorius</HI>) should actually have been an assistant to <HI>Mahomet</HI> in producing his pretended revelations; and, it is still more remarkable, that all the <HI>scorpion-like</HI> scourges of the <HI>Maho∣metan</HI> conquest (first, LAWLESS TYRANNY and the suppression of all <HI>popular rights;</HI> secondly, ROBBERY and WAR notoriously sanc∣tioned or authorized by this pretended religion against <HI>all</HI> nations and people that do not receive their doctrine; and thirdly, the fatal <HI>renewal</HI> of the old <HI>pagan</HI> oppressions of <HI>slave-holding</HI> and <HI>slave-deal∣ing,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such diabolical enormities may surely be compared to the dark exhalations of—<HI>"the bottomless pit;"</HI> and therefore our English promoters of <HI>slave-holding,</HI> and <HI>slave-dealing</HI> (who have carried these <HI>Mahometan</HI> oppressions to a greater excess, even than the <HI>Mahometans</HI> themselves) have ample reason to dread the approaching time of <HI>divine retribution,</HI> when God will—<Q><HI>destroy the destroyers of the earth,</HI></Q> and shall cause those that now—<HI>"lead into captivity"</HI> (and surely, likewise, all their abettors)—"to be <HI>led into captivity!</HI>"</NOTE> which had been happily extinguished by the general influence of <HI>christian</HI> benevolence) should have compleatly pervaded all those eastern and southern regions, of the <HI>third</HI> Empire, wherever the doctrines of <HI>Nestorius</HI> had been previously adopted, and had <HI>embit∣tered</HI> the <HI>rivers</HI> and <HI>fountains</HI> of the waters to prepare them for this signal <HI>retribution,</HI> justly due to such antichristian apostates, who deny the true <HI>rock</HI> on which the <HI>catholic church</HI> is built, viz. that <HI>"Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God;"</HI> or, as St. John has expressed the <HI>peculiar sonship,</HI> or filiation, of Christ, viz.

<HEAD>A PLAIN MATTER-OF-FACT ARGUMENT FOR THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">QUESTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FOR what END did Christ COME INTO THE WORLD?</HI></P>
<P>A. Christ was "manifested in the flesh, (that is, was made man,)—TO DIE FOR THE SINS OF MAN∣KIND,—to destroy the works of the devil—to re∣deem us from all iniquity, and to purity unto him∣self a peculiar people zealous of good works." (1 Cor. xv. 3.—1 John iii. 8.—Tit ii. 14.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. Where was Christ before he came into this world, and was manifested in the flesh?</HI></P>
<P>A. He was in Heaven. "He came down from Heaven. He was with God his Father, before the world was, before the foundation of the world: he was in the bosom of his Father, and in his Father's Glory." (John iii. 13. vi. 33. 62. i. 1. xvii. 5. 24.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="53"/><HI>Q. How was his manifestation in the flesh made known to the world?</HI></P>
<P>A. By the message of an angel to Mary his mo∣ther, to Joseph, and to certain shepherds.</P>
<P><HI>Q. Under what name was be made known?</HI></P>
<P>A. He was called JESUS, a Saviour, the Son of God, the Son of the Highest.</P>
<P><HI>Q. Who was the mother of Jesus?</HI></P>
<P>A. The Virgin Mary.</P>
<P><HI>Q. Was any prophesy fulfilled by the birth of Jesus Christ?</HI></P>
<P>A. Yes: "all this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name EMMANUEL, which being interpre∣ted, is GOD WITH US." (Matt. i. 22, 23. Isaiah vii. 14.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. What was Christ put to death for?</HI></P>
<P>A. For blasphemy, as the Jews thought it, in calling himself the Son of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q. In what did the Jews say the blasphemy con∣sisted?</HI></P>
<P>A. In this, that he being, as they supposed, a mere man, called God his own Father, thereby declaring himself to be equal with God, and to be God. (John v. 18. x. 33.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. What did Christ ever say of himself, which im∣plied, that he was God?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="54"/>A. He said that he was one with God, and par∣took of the glory of God, before the world was, that is, from all eternity.</P>
<P><HI>Catechist. Repeat the passage, in which this is said.</HI></P>
<P>A. "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine ownself, with the glory which I had with thee, before the world was." (John xvii. 5.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. What did Christ ever say of himself, which im∣plied, that he was equal with God?</HI></P>
<P>A. He said that "he and his Father are one:" that "the Father hath given all things into his power:" that "what things soever the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise:" that "the Father hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father." (John x. 30.—iii. 35.— v. 19.—v. 22.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. Who were the first witnesses, in Christ's time, in proof of Christ's divinity?</HI></P>
<P>A. His enemies, the unbelieving Jews, both the people, and their rulers.</P>
<P><HI>Q. Do you call the unbelieving Jews prior witnes∣ses to the Apostles?</HI></P>
<P>A. Yes: because this great truth, THE DIVINTY OF CHRIST, was hid from the Apostles, as well as the rest of their countrymen, till after Christ's RE∣SURRECTION FROM THE DEAD. Christ first asserted himself to be God, by calling God his Father, and himself the Son of God, in a sense, which implied,
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>that he was equal with God, and was God; for so even his unbelieving hearers understood it:—the Jews condemned him to death for it:—the Apos∣tles preached it.</P>
<P><HI>Q. As Christ knew, that this was the sense in which the Jews understood his testimony of himself, when they first charged him with blasphemy for it, did he, at his trial, attempt to deny the charge?</HI></P>
<P>A. No: he admitted the charge and confirmed it, and died for it; and appealed to the day of judgment, as their future proof of it.</P>
<P><HI>Catechist. Repeat the passage.</HI></P>
<P>A. When "the high priest asked him, and said unto him, art thou the Christ, the Son of the Bles∣sed? Jesus said, I am: and <HI>(as a proof of it,)</HI> YE shall <HI>(at the last day)</HI> see <HI>(me)</HI> the Son of man fit∣ting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven." (Mark xiv. 61, 62.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. If Christ had not been the Messiah, the Son of God, in the sense in which they understood him, would he not have undeceived them?</HI></P>
<P>A. If Jesus Christ had not been the Messiah, the Son of God, in the sense, in which the Jews un∣derstood him, he would have undeceived them, to save his own life, and to free them from a very great delusion.</P>
<P><HI>Q. But Jesus Christ was put to death for calling himself the Son of God; what then do you conclude?</HI></P>
<P>A. I conclude that Jesus Christ really was what
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>they charged him with calling himself, THE SON OF GOD; and in the sense in which they understood him; that is, that he was EQUAL WITH GOD; and was God.</P>
<P><HI>Q. You say that in the lifetime of Christ the Apos∣tles appeared not to know that Christ was God; what was their opinion after he rose from the dead?</HI></P>
<P>A. Convinced by his resurrection from the dead, according to his promise that he would <HI>raise himself</HI> from the dead, they believed him to be "their Lord and ther God"—"the word made flesh;" "God manifested in the flesh;" in whom <Q>dwelt ALL the fulness of the Godhead bodily;</Q> Em∣manuel," or, "God with us"—"the creator and upholder of all things," who "in the beginning" of all things "was with God, and was God"— "the true God and eternal life;" and "over all God blessed for ever." (John xx. 28.—John i. 14. 1 Tim. iii. 16. Coi. ii. 9. Matt. i. 23.—John i. 2. Heb. i. 3. John i. 1.—1 John v. 20. Rom. ix. 5.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whatever difficulty may be found in the various readings of any of these passages, it must vanish, like a mist, in the full light of their united evidence. To them we may confidently add the very important testimonies which in the preceding remarks and examples Mr Sharp has most happily recovered from the erroneous constructions of the common version.</NOTE>)</P>
<P><HI>Q. Now tell me in few words, what you collect from Christ's testimony of himself, as attested by the Jews of
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>his own time, condemned by the rulers, but universally propagated by the Apostles?</HI></P>
<P>A. The conclusion to be drawn from it, is, that Christ, the Son of God, is one with God, and equal with God, and is God. Christ asserted it; the Jews condemned him to die for it; he sealed his testimony with his blood. The Apostles, convin∣ced by his resurrection from the dead, believed it, and preached it, and died for it.</P>
<P><HI>Catechist. The Jews, then, put Christ to death, as an impostor and blasphemer; and yet Christians have believed in him and worshipped him, as the Son of God, for almost eighteen hundred years. How do you ac∣count for this?</HI></P>
<P>A. It was in the decrees of God, that Christ should die for the sins of mankind: If the Jews had believed him to be the Son of God, they would not have put him to death:—if he had not been put to death, as he was, he would not have "borne our sins in his own body on the cross," that is, he would not have died for our sins, THE END, for which he CAME INTO THE WORLD;—he would not have given that great and inestimable proof of the truth of Scripture, and of his own promises, which HE did, by rising from the dead; —and the Apostles would not have given that sure evidence of their own belief in Christ, the ground and confirmation of OURS, which THEY did, by dy∣ing for their crucified Lord and Master.</P>
