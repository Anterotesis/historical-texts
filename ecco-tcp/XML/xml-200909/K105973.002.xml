<P>THIS Journey is the continuation of my Tour in WALES. Another part will appear with all conve∣nient speed, and comprehend the remainder of <HI>Caernar∣vonshire,</HI> the Isle of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> the county of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and conclude with some account of SHREWSBURY, the antient seat of the <HI>British</HI> Princes; which will complete the second volume, and probably all that I shall say of our Principality; for indolence, the forerunner of age, begins to check every new attempt.</P>
<P>THIS book contains a journey from my own house to the summit of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> and takes in almost the whole of our <HI>Alpine</HI> tract.</P>
<P>As far as the Title announces, it is complete. A more general Title-Page will be given with the second part, and the journey continued regularly from p. 183.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3"/>I THANK my friends for variety of information, and must present my particular acknowlegements to Sir JOHN SEBRIGHT, Baronet, for his liberal communication of se∣veral of the late Mr. EDWARD LLWYD'S Manuscripts, which have flung great light on several parts of our history.

<P>IN this, the sequel of my former tour, I directed my course westward from <HI>Downing,</HI> passed by <HI>Whiteford,</HI> our parish-church, and ascended the hill of <HI>Garreg,</HI> or the <HI>Rock,</HI> a high and most conspicuous part of the country. The <HI>Romans</HI> took ad∣vantage of it, and placed on its summit a <HI>Pharos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A PHAROS.</NOTE> to conduct the navigators to and from <HI>Deva,</HI> along the difficult channel of the <HI>Seteia Portus.</HI> The building is still remaining. I hope my friends will not deem me an antiquarian <HI>Quixote,</HI> and imagine me mis∣taking, in this my second sally, a building, hitherto supposed to have been a wind-mill, for a <HI>Roman</HI> light-house. It is tolerably entire; its form is circular; the height considerable; the inner diameter twelve feet and a half; the thickness of the walls four feet four inches. The doors, or entrances, are opposite to each other: over each is a square funnel, like a chimney, which opens on the outside, about half way up the building. On each side is
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
a window. About four feet from the ground are three circular holes, lined with mortar, as is frequent in <HI>Roman</HI> buildings; and penetrate the whole wall, for purposes now unknown.</P>
<P>WITHINSIDE are the vestiges of a stair-case, which led to the floors, of which there appear to have been two. Along such part of the upper, which was conspicuous from the channel, are eight small square openings, cased with free-stone (the rest of the build∣ing being of rude lime-stone, bedded in hard mortar) and each of these were separated by wooden pannels, placed in deep grooves, the last still in a perfect state. In each of these partitions were placed the lights, which the <HI>Romans</HI> thought necessary to keep distinct, or to prevent from running into one, lest they should be mistaken by seamen for a star. <HI>Periculum in corrivatione ignium, ne sidus existimetur</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hist. Nat.</HI> lib. xxxvi. c. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the building is very evidently a broad and raised road, pointing from the east; and near its upper end are the marks of a trench, which surrounded and gave protection to this useful edi∣fice. Descend, and near the foot of the hill leave on the left <HI>Maen Achwynfan,</HI> the cross described in my former tour. <HI>Glol,</HI> an inclosed mountain a little farther on, has among the bushes various circular foundations of stone unmortared building. About a mile from hence, <NOTE PLACE="marg">NEWMARKET.</NOTE> visit the small town of <HI>Newmarket,</HI> almost the entire creation of its then owner, <HI>John Wynne,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Gop,</HI> who died in the present century. The antient name of the parish is <HI>Tre∣lawnyd,</HI> for which I can find no satisfactory reason. In the church-yard is a handsome old cross. Here is fixed one of the charity-schcols, founded and opened in 1726, by doctor <HI>Daniel Williams,</HI> a dissenting minister, with an endowment of eight pounds a year; a charity which he extended to every county in <HI>North Wales,</HI> dis∣tinguishing that at <HI>Wrexham,</HI> the place of his birth, by an annual
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
salary of fifteen pounds. He also established a fund, I believe, to each, from which the children are apprenticed, at five pounds apiece.</P>
<P>FROM the town I ascended the hill, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor.</NOTE> called <HI>Copa'r'leni,</HI> on whose summit is a most enormous carnedd, or tumulus, formed of lime∣stones. It was probably the site of <HI>specula,</HI> or exploratory tower, and memorial of some chieftain. If <HI>Roman,</HI> perhaps <HI>Paulinus</HI> gave name to it, <HI>Cop-Paulini.</HI> There is great uncertainty in these derivations: I may possibly as well abide by my former etymo∣logy of <HI>Cop yr Goleuni,</HI> or the Mount of Lights; for it might have been a place of signals by fire of the approach of an enemy by sea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tour in Wales, i. 413.</NOTE>, or a <HI>station</HI> of the <HI>holy fires,</HI> the <HI>Coel Ceithie</HI> of the <HI>Druids,</HI> simi∣lar to the <HI>Karn Gollewa,</HI> the carn of lights, and <HI>Karn Leskyz,</HI> or carn of burnings, of the <HI>Cornish,</HI> supposed by the learned BORLASE <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Cornwall, 131.</NOTE> to have been used for similar purposes. The tract from hence to <HI>Caerwys</HI> was certainly a field of battle: no place in <HI>North Wales</HI> exhibits an equal quantity of <HI>tumuli;</HI> but all sepulchral, as is proved by the urns discovered in them: they are of a far inferior size to the first, and covered with turf. It will not be too hazardous a conjecture to suppose, that in this place was the slaughter of the <HI>Ordovices</HI> by <HI>Agricola,</HI> when our gallant nation was nearly extir∣pated. Part of the brow of the hill is called <HI>Bryn y Saethiau,</HI> or <HI>the Hill of Arrows,</HI> from being the station of the archers in the en∣gagement.</P>
<P>RETURN along the ridge of the hill, marked its whole length with verdant tumuli, the tombs of ancient heroes. See beneath
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
me the little church of <HI>Gwaen-yskor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GWAEN-YSKOR.</NOTE> remarkable for its ancient register.</P>
<P>DESCEND to the church and village of <HI>Llanasa,</HI> the former dedi∣cated to <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> whose festival is kept on the first of <HI>May.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANASA.</NOTE> <HI>Laurence Child,</HI> Bishop of <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> in 1385, procured the impro∣priation of this church to supply his cathedral with lights <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willi's St. Asaph, 56, App. No. xxi.</NOTE>, and repair the ruins occasioned by the wars. In my approach from these high lands towards the shore, observe the ruins of a small chapel at the little hamlet of <HI>Gwespyr,</HI> near <HI>Trelacre,</HI> one of the seats of Sir <HI>Pyers Mostyn,</HI> Baronet, a branch of the house of <HI>Mostyn.</HI> His adjacent quarry is noted for the excellence of the free-stone; and his vast and profitable warren beneath, noted for the delicacy of the rabbets, by reason of their feeding on the maritime plants.</P>
<P>PASS over <HI>Gronant-Moor.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GRONANT.</NOTE> There is a tradition, that its extent was so great, that the people on this side could hold conversation over the channel with those of <HI>Cheshire.</HI> This may be exagge∣rated; but from authentic records, it appears, that this flat was formerly very extensive, and that it had been reduced to its pre∣sent scanty limits by the fury of the sea, which still possesses its antient place. Previous to that catastrophe, it was possessed by the see of <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> by virtue of a grant made by <HI>Edward the Black Prince,</HI> son of <HI>Edward</HI> III. to <HI>Llewelyn ap Madoc,</HI> elected Bishop of <HI>St. Asaph</HI> in 1357. The inundation happened before the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> V. Previous to that time, the Bishop paid annually into the exchequer at <HI>Chester,</HI> as an acknowlegement, the sum of twenty marks: but <HI>Henry</HI> V. in 1414, and <HI>Henry</HI> VI. in 1445 and 1451, in consideration of the misfortune, released
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
the see from that rent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willis's St. Asaph, 65. App. No. xxxi. xxxii.</NOTE>. If this record did not remain an incon∣teslable proof of the ravages of the ocean on this part of the coun∣try, there exist other natural ones, that would have given rea∣sonable grounds for suspicion. The <HI>Hyle sands,</HI> which run for twelve or fourteen miles parallel to the narrow hundred of <HI>Wiral,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and divided from <HI>Wales</HI> by a narrow channel, were once, in all probability, part of the firm land of <HI>England.</HI> A few miles to the west of <HI>Gronant-Moor,</HI> under the parish of <HI>Aber∣geleu,</HI> in <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> are to be seen at low water, very remote from the shore, bedded in the sand, immense numbers of oak-trees, a forest before this event. Lastly, in the church-yard wall of <HI>Abergelli</HI> is a dateless epitaph, in <HI>Welsh,</HI> signifying the person who was interred there lived three miles to the north of that spot, a tract now entirely possessed by the sea.</P>
<P>ON approaching <HI>Prestatyn,</HI> about two miles from <HI>Trelacre,</HI> the flat becomes extremely fertile in corn, especially wheat, which is of distinguished excellence; and continues equally noted through all the flat tract, as far as <HI>Ruddlan,</HI> where it is interrupted for a space by the marsh, and is again continued along the coast far beyond <HI>Abergeleu.</HI> A little below <HI>Prestatyn</HI>-mill, in a meadow, is the site of its Castle: nothing more than an elevated space, with foundations consisting of stone and mortar, and a foss at some dis∣tance from it, now remain. <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRESTATYN-CASTLE.</NOTE> This little fortress was probably built by the <HI>Welsh,</HI> but wrested from them by the <HI>English,</HI> who were possessed of it in 1167, the only time I find any mention of it, when it was destroyed by <HI>Owen Gwynedd, Cadwalader</HI> his brother,
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
and <HI>Rees</HI> Prince of <HI>South Wales;</HI> and all <HI>Tegengle</HI> reduced to the power of its lawful sovereign.</P>
<P>THE hamlet and village of <HI>Prestatyn</HI> lie in the parish of Meli∣den. This place was granted by <HI>Richard</HI> I. to <HI>Robert Banaster,</HI> who enjoyed it for three years and a half, and built the town; which was destroyed by <HI>Owen Gwynedd. Robert de Crevecoeur,</HI> in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> I. laid claim to it in right of his an∣cestor, <HI>Banaster.</HI> An inquisition was made, before a jury of twenty-four men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright's MSS.</NOTE>: their determination was in favor of <HI>Robert;</HI> since I find, by another record, that he died possessed of lands in <HI>Maelwr Saesneg</HI> and <HI>Prestatyn,</HI> which he held by the service of one knight's fee.</P>
<P>THE road from hence to <HI>Diserth</HI> is extremely pleasant, at the foot of high hills, rich in lead ore, with a fine and fertile flat to the right. The white rock makes a conspicuous figure on the left, and its sides appeared deeply trenched by the miners in search of ore. Near this place is the beginning of the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> and the ter∣mination of the range of mountains, which bound it on the east. At a small distance from hence lies the church of <HI>Diserth,</HI> in a picturesque and romantic bottom, beneath some rude rocks: the church overshaded with great yews, and the singular figure of some of the tombs, form a most striking appearance. <NOTE PLACE="marg">DISERTH CHURCH.</NOTE> A water-fall in the deep and rounded hollow of a rock, finely darkened with ivy, once gave additional beauty to this spot; but of late the di∣verting of the waters to a mill, has robbed the place of this ele∣gant variation. The stream, which is little inferior to that of <HI>Holywell,</HI> flows principally from a single well, called <HI>Fynnon Asa,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
or <HI>St. Asaph's Well,</HI> in a dingle in the parish of <HI>Cwm,</HI> about a mile distant. The fountain is inclosed with stone, in a polygonal form, and had formerly its votaries, like that of St. <HI>Winefrede.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE <HI>Diserth</HI> church, on a high rock, stand the remains of its Castle. We cannot trace the foundation of this fortress, which went by the names of <HI>Din-colyn, Castell y Ffailon,</HI> and <HI>Castell Gerri</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Llwyd's Itin.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> It probably was <HI>Welsh,</HI> and the last of the chain of <HI>British posts</HI> on the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills. <HI>Henry</HI> III. in 1241, fortified it <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Powel, 307.</NOTE>; but its date was but short, for in 1261 <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd</HI> rased both this castle, and that of <HI>Diganwy</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Same, 326.</NOTE>. It was at a siege of this place that <HI>Eineon,</HI> the son of <HI>Ririd Vlaidd,</HI> was slain <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hengwrt, MS.</NOTE>. A cross was erected on the spot, called <HI>Croes Eineon,</HI> the shaft of which, ornamented with strange sculpture, now is supposed to form the stile into the church-yard of <HI>Diserth;</HI> in which is another cross, of very curious work∣manship.</P>
<P>THE castle occupied the summit of the rock, whose sides are escarpée, or cut steep, to render the access more difficult. On one part, beneath the top, is a square out-work, with fosses cut in part through the solid lime-stone. The fragments of the castle shew, that its ruin was not effected by time: they lie in vast masses, overthrown by mining, which was a common method of besieging, very long before the use of powder.</P>
<P>IN a field a little to the south of the castle, is a ruinous build∣ing, called <HI>Siamber Wen.</HI> This is said to have been the seat of a Sir <HI>Robert Pounderling</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Llwyd's Itin. MS.</NOTE>, once constable of the adjacent castle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR ROBERT POUNDERLING.</NOTE> a knight valiant and prudent, who had one of his eyes knocked out
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
by a gentleman of <HI>Wales,</HI> in the rough sport of tournament; but being requested to challenge him again to <HI>feates of armes,</HI> on meeting our countryman at the <HI>English</HI> court, declined the com∣bat, declaring that he did not intend that the <HI>Welshman</HI> should beat out his other eye <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland's Itin.</HI> vi. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Moel Hiraddug,</HI> a <HI>British</HI> post, on a very steep and rocky hill, with an immense agger of loose stones on the accessible part, stands to the south of the castle, and forms the next to it in the chain of fortresses <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tour in Wales.</NOTE> On the east side, and on a place called <HI>Marion,</HI> are long deep trenches, out of which minerals have been dug, proba∣bly in the times of the <HI>Saxons:</HI> the ore appears, by the fragments, and color of the rubbish, to have been iron: and on the summit of the hill (which is in the parish of <HI>Cwm</HI>) is a great bed of beau∣tiful red spar, which seems to take its tinge from the ore.</P>
<P><HI>Cwn</HI> church, as the word signifies, is embosomed with hills, and fronts the vale of <HI>Clwyd.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM CHURCH.</NOTE> On a very antient stone in the church-yard is this inscription, <HI>Hic jacet</HI> TANGWISTE, <HI>uxor</HI> LLEWELIN <HI>ap</HI> INIR; but whether of <HI>Inir</HI> of <HI>Yale</HI> is uncertain.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Diserth</HI> I rode to <HI>Bod-Rhyddan,</HI> long the residence of the <HI>Conways,</HI> a family derived from Sir <HI>Hugh Conway,</HI> son of old <HI>John Coniers,</HI> of <HI>Richmond, Yorkshire,</HI> brother to <HI>Jevan</HI> Lord <HI>Coniers</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> W. Mytton's Coll. Pedigrees.</NOTE>: his son Sir <HI>Henry,</HI> by marriage with <HI>Angharat,</HI> heiress to Sir <HI>Hugh Crevecoeur,</HI> of <HI>Prestatyn</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Salusbury Pedigree, <HI>p. 68. b.</HI></NOTE>, probably acquired the settlement in this country. <HI>Prestatyn</HI> continued possessed by the <HI>Conways</HI> till the death of Sir <HI>John Conway,</HI> Baronet, in 1721, the last of the male line, when the estate was divided.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="13"/>ABOUT a mile and a half farther stands the small borough of <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> seated high on the red, clayey banks of the <HI>Clwyd,</HI> and above <HI>Morsa-Rhuddlan,</HI> a marsh celebrated for the battle in 795, between the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Welsh:</HI> our monarch <HI>Caradoc</HI> fell in the conflict <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 20.</NOTE>, and, I fear, victory declared against us. We do indeed say, that <HI>Offa,</HI> the famous king of <HI>Mercia,</HI> was slain here; but the <HI>Saxon</HI> chronicle places his death <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sax.</HI> ch. 65.</NOTE> the year before that battle. The fine plaintive <HI>Welsh</HI> tune, so well known by the name of <HI>Morfa-Rhuddlan,</HI> is supposed to have been composed on this occasion: for victories are not the only subjects for the harp. How beauti∣fully does <HI>David</HI> lament the blood of the slain on the mountains of <HI>Gilboa:</HI> HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN, AND THE WEAPONS OF WAR PERISHED!</P>
<P>THE castle had been a handsome building, in a square, with two extremes placed at opposite corners, with a double round tower at each; and a single one at the two other corners. <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> The court forms an irregular octagon. The ditch is large, faced on both sides with stone. The steep slope to the river was defended by high walls, and square towers: one is entire, and there are vestiges of two others: the first is called <HI>Twr-y-Silod;</HI> another, in the castle, was named <HI>Twr-y-Brenhin,</HI> or the <HI>King's Tower.</HI></P>
<P>To the south of the castle, at about a furlong distance, is a large artificial mount, the site of another fortress, of very early date; the whole surrounded by a very deep foss (including also the abby) which crosses from the margin of the bank, near the ascent of the present road to <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> to another parallel road; near which it is continued, then turns and falls nearly into the southern part of the
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
walled ditch of the castle: the whole forms a square area, of very great extent. These different works were formed at three several times. The mount, now called <HI>Tut-Hill,</HI> and its superstructure, (whatever it was) is thoroughly <HI>British,</HI> and is said to have been built by <HI>Llewelyn ap Sitsylt,</HI> who reigned from the year 1015 to 1020 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cambden, <HI>ii.</HI></NOTE>. It was a residence of our princes from that time: but <HI>Gryffyd ap Llewelyn,</HI> in 1063, having given offence to <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> by receiving <HI>Algar,</HI> one of his rebellious subjects, was attacked by <HI>Harold,</HI> who in revenge burned the palace at <HI>Rhudd∣lan</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>100.</HI></NOTE>. It was soon restored, and as soon lost. <HI>Robert,</HI> afterwards surnamed of <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> a valiant <HI>Norman,</HI> nephew to <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> conquered it from the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and, by the command of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, fortified it with new works <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. <HI>670.</HI></NOTE>, and made it his place of residence; from whence he greatly annoyed our countrymen. The square towers are evidently of <HI>Norman</HI> archi∣tecture, and naturally adopted by the new owner. <HI>Robert</HI> received here a visit from our prince <HI>Gryffydd ap Kynan,</HI> who came to solli∣cit aid against his enemies, from the <HI>Norman</HI> warrior; which he obtained: but on some quarrel attacked him in his castle, took and burnt the bailey, or yard, and killed such a number of his men, that very few escaped into the towers <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Gr. ap Kynan.</HI> SEBRIGHT MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> II. in 1157, added new strength to the castle, and left a considerable garrison in it before he quitted the country. Not∣withstanding this, <HI>Owen Gwynedd,</HI> in 1167, took and dismantled
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
it; but it was afterwards re-fortified by the <HI>English;</HI> for it ap∣pears that this fortress had, with two others, been bestowed by <HI>Henry,</HI> with <HI>Emma</HI> his natural sister, on <HI>David ap Owen,</HI> son and successor to <HI>Owen Gwynedd.</HI> Here, in 1187, he entertained, very nobly, <HI>Baldwin</HI> archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in his progress through <HI>Wales</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. Itin. <HI>872.</HI></NOTE>. Possibly he resigned it again to the <HI>English;</HI> for I find that in 1214 it was besieged and taken by <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth,</HI> his successor in the principality <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 270.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit relating, notwithstanding I am unable to give the year of the event, that <HI>Randle Blundeville,</HI> earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> was in this castle surprized by a body of <HI>Welsh,</HI> and lay in the utmost distress, until he was relieved by his lieutenant, <HI>Roger Lacy,</HI> alias <HI>Hell;</HI> who collecting suddenly a rabble of fiddlers and idle people, put the besiegers to flight. In reward, he received from the earl, <HI>Magisterium omnium Leccatorum et meretricum</HI> TOTIUS CESTRESHIRE <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leicester,</HI> 142. This Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> held his earldom from 1182 to 1232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I FIND it in possession of <HI>Edward</HI> I. in 1277; who was so well convinced of its importance in the conquest of <HI>Wales,</HI> that he made it the rendezvous of all the forces destined for that purpose. It was the <HI>place d'armes,</HI> and the great magazine of provision for the support of his army, in its advance into the country. The reigning prince, <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd,</HI> knew the danger of leaving so consequential a place in the hands of his enemy: but it resisted all the most vigorous efforts made on it in 1281, by <HI>Llewelyn</HI> and his brother <HI>David,</HI> just reconciled to him by the sense of their com∣mon

<P>IN order to secure it from any future attempts, <HI>Edward</HI> turned all his thoughts towards founding a fortress impregnable by any future attempts of the <HI>Welsh.</HI> He accordingly began with an act of justice, that of making recompence to <HI>Master Richard Bernard,</HI> parson of <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> for certain lands taken from him for the pur∣pose of enlarging the castle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ayl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff's Rot.

I cannot but remark here, the strong neces∣sity of curbing the new-conquered country with powerful garri∣sons; for notwithstanding all the ravages of long and barbarous wars, it remained so exceedingly populous, that <HI>Edward</HI> politi∣cally drafted out of it not less than fifteen thousand men, in aid of his <HI>Scottish</HI> expedition <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carte,</HI> II. 264.</NOTE> The consequence proved almost fatal to him: for while he lay encamped near <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> a national quarrel ensued between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welsh</HI> troops; and after great bloodshed, the latter separated themselves from his army <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>'s Anna's,</HI> II. 257.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IN respect to the civil history of <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> I find, that in the reign of <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> it made part of the great territo∣ries of earl <HI>Edwin.</HI> It was then, by reason of the inroads of <HI>Ha∣rold,</HI> a waste; and continued so when it was possessed by <HI>Hugh Lupus.</HI> It then became the capital of the district: and <HI>Hugh</HI> en∣joyed a moiety of the church, the mint, and mines of the iron ore found in the manor <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Probably those which we have mentioned in the parish of <HI>Cwm,</HI> to which this maner might have extended; for <HI>Dissarch,</HI> or <HI>Diserth,</HI> adjoining to <HI>Cwm,</HI> is cited in <HI>Doomsday-Book</HI> as belonging to it.</NOTE>; and a moiety of the water of <HI>Clwyd, i. e.</HI> of the mill and fishery on such part which belonged to earl <HI>Edwin;</HI> a moiety of the forests on the manor, and of the toll, and of the village called <HI>Bren:</HI> and there were at this time in <HI>Rhuddlan</HI> eight burgesses. All this <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> granted to <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> with an addition of certain hamlets dependent on the place; and a new borough was erected, with eighteen burgesses, who enjoyed the same privileges with those of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Bre∣tril;</HI> and were exempted from all fines exceeding twelve-pence, except in case of manslaughter, theft, and <HI>heinfare, i. e.</HI> the de∣priving a person of his servant <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doomsday-Book.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A BOROUGH.</NOTE> made this town a free borough, appointed the con∣stable of the castle for the time being to be mayor, and the bailiffs to be chosen annually by the burgesses on <HI>Michaelmas</HI>-day, who were to be presented to the constable to be sworn. The town
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
was to have power of imprisoning, except in such cases which affected the life, or loss of limb: when criminals of this nature were to be committed to the castle, burgesses only were permitted to bail. No <HI>Jews</HI> were to inhabit the town. The burgesses had a forest and free warren; a <HI>gild cum hausa et loth et shoth, sok sak et theam et insangenthest et lib. per totam terram de Theoloniis, lesta∣gio, Muragio, Danegeld, Gaywite,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS charter was given by the King at <HI>Flint, September</HI> 8th, in the twelfth year of his reign; <HI>Testibus, Rob. Bath &amp; Wells,</HI> &amp;c. and confirmed by <HI>Richard</HI> II. at <HI>Leicester,</HI> and again at <HI>West∣minster.</HI></P>

<P>THE parlement said to have been held here in 1283, <NOTE PLACE="marg">JTS PARLEMENT.</NOTE> by <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> I. was probably no more than a council assembled by the conqueror, to divide his new conquests into counties, and to give salutary laws to the <HI>Welsh;</HI> to abolish any antient customs which the wise prince thought detrimental, and to introduce such of the <HI>English</HI> as would prove of use. This was not done hastily; for in the year preceding, a commission had been appointed, with <HI>Tho∣mas Beke,</HI> bishop of <HI>St. David,</HI> president; who were to consider and report upon oath the different laws of both countries. From their resolutions were framed the famous STATUTE OF RHUDDLAN; in which, among many excellent institutions, were introduced
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
sheriffs and coroners, their powers defined, and the principal crimes of the times pointed out: most of which were acts of vio∣lence, rapine, and theft; such as might be expected to exist among people: an evil which resulted more from the turbulence of the times, than the want of wholesome laws <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Statuta Walliae</HI> passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A PIECE of antient building, called the Parlement House, is still to be seen in <HI>Rhuddlan;</HI> probably the place where the king sat in council. From hence he actually practised the well-known deceit of giving them a prince born among them, who never spoke a word of <HI>English,</HI> and whose life and conversation no man was able to stain <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 376.</NOTE>: all which our discontented nobility eagerly accepted, little thinking the person intended, to be the infant <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI> just born at <HI>Caernarvon.</HI></P>
<P>THE bridge consists of two arches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIDGE.</NOTE> It appears to have been rebuilt or repaired in 1595: that date, with the arms of <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> and the initials of <HI>William Hughes,</HI> the bishop of that time, being cut in the battlements. The tides flow very little higher than this place; and bring up to the bridge slats or vessels of about seventy tons. The port of these parts is about three miles further, at the <HI>vorryd,</HI> or <HI>great ford,</HI> where the river dis∣charges itself into the sea; and from whence much corn and tim∣ber is exported.</P>
<P>THE house called the <HI>Gwindy,</HI> or Wine House, <NOTE PLACE="marg">GWINDY.</NOTE> must not be for∣gotten. There are few towns in <HI>Wales</HI> which have not one of that name: but the use has long been lost. In old times,
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
most gentlemen's houses had one in their neighborhood, where they met their friends and retainers, to <HI>ymgampio,</HI> or to exert feats of activity. Here the gentleman kept a wine cellar, which he retailed for his own profit. Here they passed the day in archery, wrestling, throwing the sledge, and other manly exercises. At first, the drinking was moderate: but at length the purpose was abused; and these places were made the sanctuary for all sorts of crimes, committed by the dependents or friends of the owner of the <HI>Gwindy,</HI> who were recommended to his care: and there <HI>Llawruddion,</HI> i.e. persons who came <HI>red-handed</HI> from a murder, were protected till composition could be made for their crimes.</P>
<P>THE church is dedicated to <HI>St. Mary.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> It has nothing re∣markable about it, except an antient grave-stone, with a flowery cross and sword; the last the mark of the gentility of the person interred. The patronage of this church was granted in 1284 to the see of <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> in recompence for the loss of that of <HI>Eglwys∣vach,</HI> which had been taken from it, and bestowed on the abby of <HI>Conway</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis's St. Asaph,</HI> 159. <HI>Rot.

<P>THE priory of black-friers, stood about half a mile south of the castle. There is a fragment which bears the marks of antiquity: the rest is disguised in the form of a farm-house and barn. We do not know the time of its foundation: but it was certainly be∣fore the conquest by <HI>Edward</HI> I. as <HI>Anian,</HI> or <HI>Eineon de Schonan,</HI> a friar of this house, was made bishop of <HI>St. Asaph</HI> in 1268. It suffered much in the wars between <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> but soon recovered its losses, towards which they were allowed 17<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> ii. 292.</NOTE>

besides a grant of a fishery on the <HI>Clwyd</HI> with one net, free from any obstruction <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rot. Walliae.</HI> 90.</NOTE>. On the dissolution, the house was granted to <HI>Harry ap Harry,</HI> and now belongs to <HI>John Davies,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Llanerch.</HI></P>
<P>NEAR this place were certain lands, called <HI>Nunneland</HI> and <HI>St. Marieland</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>: but whether they had reference to any house of fe∣male religious, I cannot say.</P>
<P>THE hospital, which existed in 1281, stood between the town and <HI>Bodyryddan.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Edward</HI> I. had finished the fortifications of <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> and filled his new town with inhabitants, he and bishop <HI>Anian</HI> II. made different petitions to the pope, to remove the see of <HI>St. Asaph</HI> to this place <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> ii. 245, <HI>Willis's St. Asaph,</HI> 45.149.155.</NOTE> They urged the solitude and insecurity of the former; its hazard from <HI>banditti;</HI> and the danger to which the body of the most glorious confessor <HI>St. Asaph</HI> was continually exposed: and the king in particular adds, the great safety of this place, by reason of the vast works he had completed. But these petitions never took effect: frustrated either by the death of the pope, or the exhortion of the archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to rebuild the cathedral on its antient site.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond the priory I descended the bank, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. ASAPH.</NOTE> and fording the <HI>Clwyd,</HI> soon came in sight of <HI>St. Asaph.</HI> The handsome exten∣sive bridge, the little town, and the cathedral mixed with trees, form a most agreeable view. The place is seated on the slope of a pleasant eminence: the cathedral on its summit. The <HI>Clwyd</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
runs on the eastern side: the <HI>Elwy,</HI> a most turbulent stream; on the western: and from the last is taken the <HI>British</HI> name of <HI>Llan-Elwy.</HI> The township in which it stands, is also called <HI>Bryn-Paulin;</HI> and one part of it, <HI>Bron y Wylfa,</HI> or the <HI>brow of the watch:</HI> from which circumstances, as well as the great fitness of the situation, between two rivers, I cannot but think that it was a place of encampment of <HI>Paulinus,</HI> in his way; to or from <HI>Mona.</HI></P>
<P>ITS ecclesiastical history may be spoken of with more certainty. When <HI>Kentigern,</HI> bishop of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> was driven from his see in 543, he retired into <HI>Wales,</HI> and established here a monastery for nine hundred and sixty-five monks, instituted on the same plan with that of <HI>Bangor;</HI> part for labor, part for prayer. <NOTE PLACE="marg">SII.</NOTE> Here he built a church; and having won over the <HI>British</HI> prince <HI>Maglo∣cunus,</HI> once his violent opponent, established here a see, and was himself the first bishop. Being recalled to <HI>Scotland,</HI> he nominated for successor, <HI>Asaph,</HI> or <HI>Hassaph,</HI> a Briton of great piety and good family (being grandson of <HI>Pabo pou Prydain).</HI> He died in 596, was buried in his cathedral, and gave name to the place.</P>
<P>THE church was first built of wood; but soon after, of stone. In 1247, during the wars of <HI>Henry</HI> III. the diocese was destroyed by fire and sword <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> 642.</NOTE>, and the bishop, who sided with the English, obliged to live on alms. In 1282, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CATHEDRAL.</NOTE> the cathedral was burnt down; but ample amends was made to the see, by the grant of <HI>Edward</HI> I. of lands in <HI>Newmarket, Nannerch, Dincolyn, Cwed y Mynedd,</HI> and a rich mineral tract in <HI>Diserth:</HI> four hundred and nine acres were given, each of which appears at that time to be valued at only
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
six-pence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>. In 1402, the church underwent new misfortunes: being burnt by <HI>Owen Glyndwr,</HI> together with the palace, and ca∣nons houses; who, strange to say! soon after brought over to his party, <HI>John Trevor,</HI> the injured bishop of the see, who was de∣prived on account of his revolt. After this, the church remained in ruins for eighty years, when it was re-built by that worthy pre∣late, <HI>Richard Redman.</HI> The same building still remains, hand∣some, plain, and neat. The present dean and chapter are now re∣building (out of a fund vested in them for that purpose) the choir, after the inevitable dilapidations of time in the space of near four hundred years. The good imitation of the gothic, and the happy copy in the east window, of the noble remains in <HI>Tintern</HI> abby, will add no small beauty to the church, and credit to the idea.</P>
<P>THE tombs are very few.<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMBS.</NOTE> Here is one in an episcopal habit, supposed to commemorate that munificent bishop, <HI>David ap Owen,</HI> who died in 1512; and in the church-yard, near the west door, is a plain altar monument of bishop <HI>Isaac Barrow,</HI> who de∣parted in 1680: and whose pious address I can read without any offence, howsoever papistical zealots may think it.

<P>IN the church-yard of the parish-church, is another tomb, sin∣gular enough, with foliage, a shield with a lion rampant, inscribed around, <HI>Hic jacet Ranulsus de Smalwode;</HI> and beneath the shield passes a sword, held by a hand.

<P>THIS church stands at the lower part of the town, and serves for the use of the inhabitants of the town and country, the cathe∣dral not being used for that purpose.</P>
<P>THE members of the chapter are the dean, archdeacon, (who is the bishop) six prebendaries, and seven canons. Besides these, belong to the church, four vicars choral, four singing-men, four choristers, and an organist.</P>
<P>THE present palace is not very magnificent. The walls are the same with those built by bishop <HI>David ap Owen,</HI> restorer of the house, in 1503, after it had lain in ruins a hundred years.</P>
<P>THE diocese comprehends all <HI>Flintshire,</HI> excepting <HI>Hawarden;</HI> all <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> but the deanery of <HI>Dyffrin Clwyd;</HI> all <HI>Montgome∣ryshire,</HI> excepting seven parishes; and the hundreds of <HI>Mowddwie,

<P>THE road from <HI>St. Asaph</HI> along the common called the <HI>Row,</HI> is extremely beautiful: is watered by the <HI>Elwy,</HI> which runs be∣neath lofty banks, finely wooded: at its extremity is <HI>Pont yr allt Gôch,</HI> a noble bridge of one lofty arch, eighty-five feet in dia∣meter. The <HI>Elwy</HI> here takes another direction, running west, and then north, along most romantic dingles, varied with meadows, woods, and cavernous rocks: neither is it destitute of antiquities. <HI>Y fynnon vair,</HI> or our lady's well, a fine spring, inclosed in an angu∣lar wall, formerly roofed; and the ruins of a cross-shaped cha∣pel, finely over-grown with ivy, exhibit a venerable view, in a deep wooded bottom, not remote from the bridge: and this, in days of pilgrimage, the frequent haunt of devotees.</P>
<P>THE most capital view of these picturesque glens, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PENCRAIG.</NOTE> is from <HI>Pen∣craig,</HI> on the grounds of Mrs. <HI>Jones,</HI> of <HI>Galt-vaenan;</HI> from whence is a sight of three at once, together with an unspeakable variety of other objects, extremely worthy a visit from every traveller.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Llannerch,</HI> the chief seat of my kinsman, <HI>John Davies,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> formerly called <HI>Lleweni Vechan,</HI> about half a mile to the east of the bridge, I stopped a while to admire the charming view of the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> with the magnificent boundary between it and <HI>Flintshire.</HI> The intervening plain is of matchless fertility: inclo∣sures creep high up the hills; the remaining part is divided into
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
various summirs, in the season, glowing to the setting sun with the purple flowers of the heath. Churches and neat mansions en∣liven the scene. From <HI>Tremeirchion-Green,</HI> placed high above <HI>Llannerch,</HI> is a very fine view of the whole vale, of the western <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundary, and the lofty tract of <HI>Snowdon.</HI> The middle, from end to end, is enriched with towns and castles; among which rises supreme, the rock of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> topped with its great fortress.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Tremeirchion</HI> church is the mutilated tomb of Sir <HI>Robert Pounderling,</HI> before mentioned. By his crossed legs, it seems he had attained the merit of pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre.</P>
<P>UNDER a handsome gothic arch lies, <NOTE PLACE="marg">DAFYDD DDU.</NOTE> in priestly vestments, well executed, the image of <HI>Dafydd Ddu,</HI> or the black of Hirad∣dug. Underneath is inscribed, <HI>Hic jacet</HI> DAVID AP RODERIC AP MADOC. He was vicar of this place, and dignitary of <HI>St. Asaph:</HI> prophet and poet; and had a great concern in regulating our prosody. The <HI>Daroganen,</HI> or prophecies of <HI>Robin Ddu,</HI> so cele∣brated in <HI>North Wales,</HI> I believe properly belong to <HI>Dafydd,</HI> who flourished in 1340, above a hundred years before the time of <HI>Robin.</HI></P>
<P>IN this church stood a cross, celebrated for its miracles, which are celebrated in an <HI>owdwl,</HI> or poem, about the year 1500, by <HI>Gryffydd ap Isan ap Llen vychan.</HI> The cross is now demolished; but the carved capital is still to be seen, in a building adjoining to the church-yard.</P>
<P>IN the bottom, not far from <HI>Tremerchion,</HI> lies, half buried in woods, the singular house of <HI>Bachegraig.</HI> It consists of a mansion, and three sides, inclosing a square court. The first consists of a vast hall, and parlour: the rest of it rises into six wonderful sto∣ries,
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
including the cupola; and forms from the second floor the figure of a pyramid: the rooms small, and inconvenient. The bricks are admirable, and appear to have been made in <HI>Holland;</HI> and the model of the house was probably brought from <HI>Flanders,</HI> where this species of building was not unfrequent. The country people say, that it was built by the devil, in one night, and that the architect still preserves an apartment in it: but Sir <HI>Richard Clough,</HI> an eminent merchant in the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> seems to have a better title to the honor. The initials of his name are in iron on the front, with the date 1567; and on the gate-way that of 1569.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Richard</HI> was a man of distinguished character, who raised himself, by his merit, from a poor boy at <HI>Denbigh,</HI> to one of the greatest merchants of his time. He was first a chorister at <HI>Chester</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Puller</HI>'s Br.

His re∣sidence was chiefly at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where his body was interred: his heart in <HI>Whichurch,</HI> a neighbouring church. He is said to have made a pilgrimage to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and to have been made knight of the <HI>holy sepulchre:</HI> this is confirmed; for he assumed the five crosses, the badge of that order, for his arms <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Salusbury Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gree,</HI> 17</NOTE>. His wealth was so great, that <HI>Ese a aeth yn Glough,</HI> or <HI>He is become a</HI> CLOUGH, grew into a proverb, on the attainment of riches by any person. He left two daughters: one he bestowed, with this house, and certain tythes in <HI>Llein,</HI> on <HI>Roger Salusbury,</HI> a younger son of <HI>Llewenni:</HI> the other on a <HI>Wynne,</HI> of <HI>Melay,</HI> with whom he gave

<P>IN front of the house, cross the <HI>Clwyd</HI> on <HI>Pont y Cambull,</HI> and, turning to the left, cross it again at <HI>Pont Gryffydd,</HI> in order to search in the parish of <HI>Bodfari,</HI> for the antient <HI>Varis.</HI> Soon enter the deep pass, formed by nature in the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills, from the vales into the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> But neither my own examination, or that of some intelligent friends, availed any thing.

He succeeded to the estate on the execution of his elder brother <HI>Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I. SIR THOMAS.</NOTE> who suffered in 1586, for his concern in <HI>Babington</HI>'s plot. A picture, supposed to be his, is to be seen here; representing him in a grey and black vest, dark hair, short whiskers, bushy beard, and with an ear-ring: his bonnet in his hand; his breast naked.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Henry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR HENRY.</NOTE> the first baronet, is placed sitting in his shirt; his bosom naked: over one arm is cast a red mantle: his breeches red, with points at his knees; his stockings purple; his slippers
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
rich in lace; his beard bushy; his whiskers small: he is seated in a balcony, as if at his toilet. I have seen here a fine picture of his eldest son, Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">II. SIR THOMAS.</NOTE> as much distinguished by his pen as his sword. He appears as if on the point of quitting his family, to join the army; for he was a distinguished loyalist in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> I. He is taking leave of his lady and three children; is dressed in a buff surtout, brown boots, with a rich scymetar by his side; attended by two grehounds, a groom, dressed in a long canvas gown, holding a horse, with the arms of the house on the man's shoulders, by way of badge. This gentleman was edu∣cated at <HI>Jesus College, Oxford:</HI> and having, as <HI>Wood</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Athen, Oxon.</HI> ii. 25.</NOTE> says, a na∣tural geny to poetry and romance, exercised himself much in those juvenile studies; and produced from his pen, the <HI>History of Joseph,</HI> in <HI>English</HI> verse, in thirteen chapters. He retired to <HI>Lleweni;</HI> and died in 1643.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit the portrait of a lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CATHERINE Y BERAIN.</NOTE> exceedingly celebrated in this part of <HI>Wales;</HI> the famous <HI>Catherine Tudor,</HI> better known by the name of <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Berain,</HI> from her seat in this neigh∣borhood. She was daughter and heiress of <HI>Tudor ap Robert Fychan,</HI> of <HI>Berain:</HI> she took for her first husband <HI>John Salusbury,</HI> heir of <HI>Lleweni;</HI> and on his death gave her hand to Sir <HI>Richard Clough.</HI> The tradition goes, that at the funeral of her beloved spouse, she was led to church by Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> and from church by <HI>Morris Wynne,</HI> of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> who whispered to her his wish of being her second: she refused him with great civility, informing him, that she had accepted the proposals of Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> in her way to
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
church; but assured him (and was as good as her word) that in case she performed the same sad duty (which she was then about) to the knight, he might depend on being her third. From this match I have the honor of some of <HI>Catherine</HI>'s blood in my veins. As soon as she had composed this gentleman, to shew that she had no superstition about the number THREE, she concluded with <HI>Ed∣ward Thelwal,</HI> of <HI>Plas y Ward,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> departed this life <HI>August</HI> 27; and was interred at <HI>Llanivydd</HI> on the 1st of <HI>September,</HI> 1591.</P>
<P>HER portrait is an excellent three-quarters, on wood. The plate represents the dress. By the date, 1568, it seems to have been painted by <HI>Lucas de Heere;</HI> the only artist which I know of in that period, equal to the performance. I was told, that in the locket she wore to the gold chain, was the hair of her second and favorite husband.</P>
<P><HI>Lleweni,</HI> notwithstanding it lies on a flat, has most pleasing views of the mountains on each side of the vale: the town and castle of <HI>Denbigh</HI> form most capital objects, at the distance of two miles: and the nearer environs of the place, promise to animate die country by the commercial spirit of their active master.</P>
<P><HI>David,</HI> brother of our last <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> makes great complaints of the havock made by <HI>Reginald de Grey,</HI> justice of <HI>Chester,</HI> in cutting down his wood of <HI>Lleweni</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 350.</NOTE>; which <HI>David</HI> probably held as lord of <HI>Denbigh.</HI></P>

<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
<HI>Elizabeth</HI>) who, with <HI>Jane</HI> his wife, was interred beneath. Be∣hind him are nine sons: behind her seven daughters. He died in 1575: she in 1565. His virtues are rehearsed in the following quaint lines:
<Q><L>In vayn we bragg and boast of blood, in vayne of sinne we vaunte,</L>
<L>Syth flesh and blood must lodge at last where nature did us graunte.</L>
<L>So where he lyeth that lyved of late with love and favour muche,</L>
<L>To fynde his friend, to feel his foes, his country skante had suche.</L>
<L>When lyff did well reporte his death, whose death hys lyff doth trye,</L>
<L>And poyntes with fynger what he was that here in claye doth lye.</L>
<L>His virtues shall enroll his actes, his tombe shall tell his name,</L>
<L>His sonnes and daughters left behind, shall blaze on Erth his fame.</L>
<L>Look under feete and you shall fynde, upon the stone yow stande,</L>
<L>The race he ranne, the lyff he lead, each with an upright hand.</L></Q></P>
<P>SEVERAL of the sons were men of distinguished characters. The third, <HI>William,</HI> was a sea captain, and an eminent poet. His early education was at <HI>Oxford:</HI> but his military turn led him abroad, where he signalized himself as soldier and sailor. He translated the psalms into <HI>Welsh</HI> metre, and finished them on <HI>Jan.</HI> 4th, 1595, <HI>apud</HI> Scutum <HI>insulam occidentalium Indorum;</HI> which, as well as his <HI>Barddoniaeth,</HI> or art of <HI>Welsh</HI> poetry, were published in <HI>London:</HI> the first in 1603, the other in 1593<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Athen. Oxon.</HI> i. 284.</NOTE>. It is sayed, that he, with captain <HI>Thomas Price,</HI> of <HI>Plâsyollin,</HI> and one captain <HI>Koet,</HI> were the first who smoked, or (as they called it) drank tobacco pub∣lickly in <HI>London;</HI> and that the <HI>Londoners</HI> flocked from all parts to see them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>. Pipes were not then invented, so they used the
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
twisted leaves, or <HI>segars.</HI> The invention is usually ascribed to Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh.</HI> It may be so; but he was too good a courtier to smoke in public, especially in the reign of <HI>James,</HI> who even condescended to write a book against the practice, under the title of <HI>The Counter-blast to Tobacco.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas,</HI> the fourth son, became lord mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and was the founder of the family of <HI>Chirkcastle.</HI> It is recorded, that having married a young wife in his old age, the famous song of <HI>Room for cuckolds, here comes my lord mayor!</HI> was invented on the occasion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Myddelton Pedigree, MS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Charles,</HI> the fifth son, succeeded his father in the government of <HI>Denbigh</HI> castle.</P>
<P>I NOW speak of the sixth son, <HI>Hugh;</HI> a person whose useful life would give lustre to the greatest family. This gentleman (after∣wards Sir <HI>Hugh</HI>) displayed very early his great talents; and began, as we are told by himself, by searching for coal within a mile of his native place. His attempt did not meet with success: his genius was destined to act on a greater stage. The Capital af∣forded him ample space for his vast attempts: few readers need be told, that he planned and brought to perfection, the great de∣sign of supplying the city with water. This plan was meditated in the reign of <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> but no one was found bold enough to attempt it. In 1608, the dauntless WELSHMAN stept forth, and SMOTE THE ROCK: and on <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1613, the waters flowed into the thirsting metropolis. He brought it, in defiance of hills and vallies, reckoning every winding, near thirty-nine miles; conveyed it by aqueducts in some places; in others pierced the
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
high grounds, and gave it a subterraneous course. He was a true prototype of the later genius of similar works; but he sacrificed private fortune to the public good. Two thousand pounds a month, which he gained from the <HI>Cardiganshire</HI> mines, were swallowed up in this river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fodina Regales.</HI> 32.</NOTE>. He received the empty honor of seeing himself attended by the king, his court, and all the corpo∣ration of <HI>London,</HI> among whom was his brother (designed mayor for the ensuing year). The waters gushed out in their presence, and the great architect received their applause, and knighthood; and, in 1622, the title of baronet. His own fair fortune being expended on an undertaking, which now brings in to the pro∣prietors an amazing revenue, he was reduced to become a hireling surveyor, and was eminently useful in every place where draining or mining was requisite. I shall have occa∣sion to speak of some other of his labors in the course of this book. He died in 1631<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Myddelton Pedegree MS.</NOTE>. Sir — <HI>Myddelton,</HI> the last baronet of this branch of the family, died a few years ago. The present representative is a widow in distressful circumstances: Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> left a certain number of shares to the <HI>Goldsmith</HI>'s company, to be divided among the poor members; but, as the husband of this poor woman happened not to be of the company, the repre∣sentative of the greatest benefactor <HI>London</HI> ever had, is, I trust through ignorance of her case, permitted to linger away her days in cruel penury.</P>
<P>A MURAL monument needlessly attempts to preserve the me∣mory of that great antiquary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HUMPHREY LLWYD.</NOTE> <HI>Humphrey Llwyd.</HI> He is repre∣sented in a <HI>Spanish</HI> dress, kneeling at an altar, beneath a range of
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>
small arches; above, a multitude of quarterings proclame his long descent. He derived himself from the <HI>Rosendales</HI> of the north, who settled at <HI>Foxhall,</HI> in this neighborhood, in 1297, by marriage with the heiress of the place. He himself was of a branch, which fixed at <HI>Denbigh.</HI> He was educated at <HI>Oxford,</HI> a commoner of <HI>Brazen-nose</HI> college, and master of arts. He re∣turned to his native place, an accomplished gentleman. He stu∣died at the university the healing art; but is celebrated as a per∣son of great eloquence, an excellent rhetorician, and sound philo∣sopher. After the panegyric passed on him by <HI>Cambden,</HI> it would be presumptious to add any thing relative to his great skill in the antiquities of our country. He practised, for his amusement, physic and music. The motto on his portrait, in possession of his representative <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> of <HI>Aston,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> expresses his liberal turn of mind: <HI>Hwy pery klod Nagolyd;</HI> FAME IS BETTER THAN WEALTH. In medicine, and the study of antiquities, he has left several proofs of his knowlege, which seems to have been quite unconfined. He made the map of <HI>England,</HI> for his friend <HI>Ortelius.</HI> For his bro∣ther-in-law, lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> (whose sister he married) he formed a large collection of useful and curious books; which were after∣wards purchased by <HI>James</HI> I. and now make the most valuable part of the <HI>British Museum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Grainger,</HI> i. 270. For the history of his works, see <HI>Athen. Oxon.</HI> i.</NOTE>. In his last letter to the great geo∣grapher <HI>Ortelius</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prefixed to his <HI>Commentarioli Britannicae descriptionis fragmentum.</HI> 410 <HI>edit.</HI></NOTE>, he foresees his own death, which happened soon after its date, in <HI>August</HI> 1568, aged 41. The very simple inscription on the monument promises his character; but instead, appears only three lines of a psalm tune.</P>

<P>THE tomb of Sir <HI>John Salusbury</HI> is altar-shaped: his image, and that of his lady, are placed in it, recumbent; he in armour; she with a great ruff. Nothing is recorded of this good couple, except that Sir <HI>John</HI> died in 1578; and that ten years after she erected this monument to his memory, and I suppose to her own, a blank being left for the year and day of her departure.</P>
<P>A LITTLE further stands <HI>Denbigh,</HI> placed, like <HI>Sterling,</HI> on the slope of a great rock, crowned with a castle. Its antient <HI>British</HI> name was <HI>Castell Kled vryn yn Rhôs,</HI> or the Craggy Hill in <HI>Rhos,</HI> the former name of the tract in which it is seated. The word <HI>Dinbech,</HI> the present <HI>Welsh</HI> appellation, signifies a small hill, which it is, comparative to the neighboring mountains. The first time I find any mention of it, is in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. from whom <HI>David,</HI> in defiance of his brother <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> chose to hold this lordship, together with the cantred of <HI>Dyffryn Clwyd</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae Walliae.</HI> 66.</NOTE>. He made it his residence till the conquest of our country; soon after which, he was taken near the place, and car∣ried, loaden with irons, to the <HI>English</HI> monarch at <HI>Rhuddlan.</HI></P>
<P>THE king politically secured his new acquisitions, by bestowing several of the great lordships on his followers. He gave that of
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
<HI>Denbigh</HI> to <HI>Henry Lacy,</HI> earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> who built the castle, and inclosed within a wall the small town he found there. Among other priveleges, he gave his vassals liberty of killing and destroy∣ing all manner of wild beasts on the lordship, except in certain parts reserved out of the grant; I suppose for the purpose of the particular amusement of the lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> MSS.</NOTE>; for I find, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. the names of five parks in this lordship, viz. <HI>Moylewike, Caresnodooke, Kylford, Bagh<SUP>a</SUP>̄,</HI> and <HI>Posey,</HI> of which the king consti∣tuted <HI>Owen Tudor,</HI> ranger. On the death of <HI>Lacy,</HI> the lordship passed to <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> by virtue of his marriage with <HI>Alicia,</HI> daughter of the last possessor. After the attainder of <HI>Tho∣mas, Edward</HI> II. bestowed it on <HI>Hugh D'Espencer;</HI> who proved an oppressive superior, and abridged the inhabitants of the priveleges granted to them by <HI>Lacy</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE>. By the fatal end of that favorite, it fell again to the crown; and was given by <HI>Edward</HI> III. to ano∣ther, equally unfortunate, <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> earl of <HI>March;</HI> whose death enabled the king to invest with this lordship <HI>William Moun∣tacute</HI> earl of <HI>Salusbury.</HI> He died in 1333: and on the reversal of the attainder of the earl of <HI>March,</HI> it was restored to his family, in the perfon of his grandson <HI>Roger:</HI> and by the marriage of <HI>Anne,</HI> sister to another <HI>Roger,</HI> last earl of <HI>March,</HI> with <HI>Richard Plantagenet</HI> earl of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> it came into the house of <HI>York,</HI> and so into the crown. Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in 1563, bestowed it, as a most valuable gift, on her unmerited minion, <HI>Robert Dudley</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester;</HI> who soon made the country feel the weight of his oppression. Notwithstanding the tenants made him a present of
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
two thousand pounds at his first entrance into the lordship, he re∣mained unsatisfied; he constrained the freeholders to raise the old rents of 250 <HI>l.</HI> a year, to 8 or 900 <HI>l.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Secret Memoirs of <HI>Robert</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> 89.</NOTE> and at his will inclosed the waste lands, to the injury of the tenants; who, offended at his ra∣pacity, arose, and levelled his encroachments. This was con∣strued into riot and rebellion: two hopeful young men, of the house of <HI>Lleweni,</HI> were taken to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> tried and executed there, for the pretended offence. He had the insolence even to mortgage the manor to some merchants of <HI>London</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strife's Annals,</HI> ii. 498.</NOTE>; and, I ap∣prehend, tricked them for their credulity. The various disor∣ders which rose from these practices, were so great, that <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> interposed, and by charter confirmed the quiet possession of the tenants, and allayed the discontents<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Baron <HI>Price</HI>'s Speech.</NOTE>. These were again excited in die reign of king <HI>William,</HI> by the vast grant made to the earl of <HI>Portland.</HI> The same ferments arose, and the same means were used to allay them: at present, this, and the other great manors of <HI>Bromefield</HI> and <HI>Yale,</HI> remain in the crown, and are peacefully superintended by a steward appointed by the king.</P>
<P>THE castle and inclosed part of the town, took up a very consi∣derable space, and were defended by strong walls and towers: the last are chiefly square. There are two gates to the outmost pre∣cinct: that called the <HI>Burgesses Tower,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GATES.</NOTE> is large, square, and built singularly, with small ashler stones. The other was called the <HI>Exchequer Gate,</HI> in which the lord's court was kept. Some few houses, with most beautiful views, are at present inhabited in this
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
part. <HI>Leland</HI> says, that there had been divers rows of streets; but in his time there were scarcely eighty housholders within these walls. Here stands the chapel, called <HI>St. Hillary's,</HI> formerly be∣longing to the garrison, now the place of worship for the town. In old times, on every Sunday here were masses for the souls of <HI>Lacy</HI> and <HI>Percy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland</HI> ITIN. v. 61.</NOTE>. Not far from it are the remains of an unfi∣nished church, a hundred and seventy-five feet long, and seventy-one broad, and designed to have been supported by two rows of pillars. This noble building was begun in 1579, as appears by the date on a foundation-stone. It was to this purpose; for at present it is much defaced:

<P>THIS church was begun under the auspices of <HI>Leicester:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> but it is said that he left off his buildings in <HI>Wales,</HI> by reason of the public hatred he had incurred on account of his tyranny<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Memoirs.</HI></NOTE>. A sum was afterwards collected, in order to complete the work;
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
but it is said, that when the earl of Essex passed through <HI>Denbigh,</HI> on his <HI>Irish</HI> expedition, he borrowed the money destined for the purpose, which was never repayed; and by that means, the church was left unfinished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Foulk</HI>'s Papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Castle crowns the summit of the hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> one side of which is quite precipitous. The entrance is very magnificent, beneath a gothic arch, over which is the statue of <HI>Henry Lacy,</HI> sitting in stately flowing robes. On each side of the gate-way stood a large octagonal tower. The breaches in it are vast and awful: they serve to discover the antient manner of building: a double wall appears to have been built, with a great vacancy between, into which was poured all forts of rubbish, stone, and hot mortar, which time consolidated to a stony hardness. This part, as <HI>Leland</HI> says, was never completed, the work having been deserted by the earl, on the loss of his eldest son, who was accidentally drowned in the well, whose opening is still to be seen in the castle-yard. <HI>Charles</HI> I. lay here on the 23d of <HI>September,</HI> 1645, after his retreat from <HI>Chester,</HI> in a tower still called <HI>Siamber y Brenbin,</HI> or the <HI>King's Tower.</HI></P>
<P>THE prospect through the broken arches is extremely fine, ex∣tending in parts over the whole vale, and all its eastern hills, from <HI>Moel Venlli</HI> to <HI>Diserth</HI> rock; a rich view, but deficient in water: the river <HI>Clwyd</HI> being too small to be seen; and in great rains so furious, as to overflow a great space of the meadowy tract.</P>
<P>LELAND relates a particular of this fortress, which I do not dis∣cover in any other historian: he says, that <HI>Edward</HI> IV. was be∣sieged in it; and that he was permitted to retire, on condition

<PB N="37" REF="42"/>that he should quit the kingdom for ever. The only time in which that prince was constrained to abdicate his dominions, was in 1470, when he took shipping at <HI>Lynn;</HI> not by reason of any capitulation with his enemies, but through the desperate situation of his affairs at that period.</P>
<P><HI>fasper Tudor,</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> had, in the year 1459, possessed this place, and several others in the principality, in behalf of his weak half-brother, <HI>Henry</HI> VI.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Baron,</HI> ii. 241</NOTE> but they were wrested from him by the <HI>Yorkists</HI> in the following year. In 1468 he returned, was joined by two thousand <HI>Welsh,</HI> and burnt the town<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Carte. ii. 775.</NOTE>; meditating rather revenge than conquest.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of <HI>November</HI> 1645, the parlement army ob∣tained, near this town, a most important victory over the royalists. The latter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE.</NOTE> under the command of Sir <HI>William Vaughan,</HI> had formed a considerable body of forces, <HI>Welsh</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> with a de∣sign of marching to the relief of <HI>Chester,</HI> then besieged: Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Brereton</HI> had notice of the design, and immediately detached that able officer <HI>Mytton,</HI> and under him colonel <HI>Jones</HI> and colonel <HI>Louthian,</HI> with one thousand four hundred horse, and a thousand foot, to frustrate the plan. <HI>Mytton</HI> did his duty, attacked the royalists with vigor, and after several hot engagements, totally routed them, took five hundred horse and four hundred foot, killed one hundred, and so entirely dispersed them, as not to leave a hundred together in one place<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock,</HI> 179.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 164,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIEGE.</NOTE> we find the castle garrisoned by the loyalists: its go∣vernor

was colonel <HI>William Salusbury,</HI> of <HI>Bachymbyd,</HI> commonly called <HI>Salusbury Hosandu Gleisiau,</HI> or <HI>Blue Stockings.</HI> The siege was begun under the conduct of major-general <HI>Mytton,</HI> about the 16th of <HI>July</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock,</HI> 216.</NOTE>; but such was the gallant defence of the besieged, that it was not surrendered till the 3d of <HI>November,</HI> and then only on the most honorable conditions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 226.

<P>THE priory of <HI>Carmelites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY.</NOTE> or <HI>White Friars,</HI> stood at the bottom of the town.

It begins with citing the last charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARTER.</NOTE> which is that granted by king <HI>Charles</HI> II. which recites letters patent granted by queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and dated at <HI>Westminster</HI> the 20th of <HI>June,</HI> in the thirty-ninth year of her reign; in which the said queen recites, "That seeing <HI>Edward</HI> I. by his letters patent, dated at <HI>Northampton</HI> the 29th of <HI>August,</HI> in the eighteenth year of his reign, hath granted to <HI>Henry de Lacy,</HI> earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> that all his men then inhabiting his town of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> or that should for ever inhabit it, through all his territories, formerly belonging to the king of <HI>Wales,</HI> and also through the counties of <HI>Chester, Salop, Stafford, Gloucester, Worcester,</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> should be free and ac∣quitted for ever from all toll, stallage, payage, panage, murage, pontage, and passage; and seeing also king <HI>Edward</HI> III. by his letters patent, dated at <HI>York</HI> the 27th of <HI>October,</HI> in the sixth year of his reign, hath, for himself, and his heirs and successors, then inha∣biting, and afterward to inhabit, the said town, should, through the kingdom and dominions, be free and acquitted from all such toll, stallage, payage, murage, pontage, and passage; and seeing also that <HI>Richard</HI> II. by his letters patent, dated at <HI>Westminster</HI> the 22d of <HI>February,</HI> in the second year of his reign, granted to the abovesaid men, that the aforesaid town of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> and half a mile compass about the town, should be a free borough, and that the men inhabiting, and afterwards to inhabit, should be free bur∣gesses; and seeing also that <HI>Richard</HI> III. by his letters, dated at
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
<HI>Westminster</HI> the 10th of <HI>December,</HI> in the second year of his reign, confirmed the aforesaid grants, and by his said letters patent did grant unto the said burgesses, their heirs and assigns, being <HI>English∣men,</HI> common of pasture for all manner of cattle, at all times in the year, in the common pasture of the town and forest of <HI>Lleweney;</HI> and that the burgesses aforesaid, and their heirs and assigns, should be free and acquitted, in all his dominions and territories in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> soc, sac, toll, and them, lastage, stallage, payage, pannage, pontage, murage, and other customs whatsoever. And the aforesaid queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by her said letters patent, did ordain, constitute, grant, and confirm, that the town and borough of <HI>Denbigh</HI> may extend, on every side, one mile and a half, according to the common acceptations of that place, from the high cross standing in the market-place of the said town; and that the said town and borough of itself, and the burgesses of the said borough, now and hereafter in being, be, and shall be for ever hereafter, one body corporate and politick, in things, fact, and name, by the name of "THE ALDERMEN, BAILIFFS, and BURGESSES of the borough of <HI>Denbigh;"</HI> and it is also ordained, that there be a common seal for transacting of any causes or businesses; and also ordained, that there be two aldermen, two bailiffs, and two coro∣ners, and twenty-five of the better sort and best reputed of the bur∣gesses, to be capital burgesses and counsellors of the said borough.</P>
<P>"THE aldermen and bailiffs are elected and nominated upon <HI>Michaelmas-day,</HI> yearly. There are two other officers, called ser∣jeants at mace (or mace-bearers) for the execution of processes and mandates issuing out of the court of the said borough; they are appointed by the bailiffs of the said borough for the time being.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="46"/>"THERE is also a recorder of the said borough, who is appointed by the aldermen, bailiffs, and capital burgesses.</P>
<P>"CONSTABLES, leavelookers, and other inferior officers, are likewise appointed by the aldermen, bailiffs, and capital burgesses.</P>
<P>"THERE is a council chamber, or guild, within the said borough, for the purpose of holding and sitting courts of convocation, be∣fore the aldermen, bailiffs, and capital burgesses.</P>
<P>"THERE is a court of record, to be held every other <HI>Friday</HI> through the year, before the bailiffs of the said borough, or one of them; and in that court, by complaint made in it, they may hold all and all manner of pleas, actions, suits, demands of all sorts of transgressions <HI>vi et armis,</HI> or otherwise; and also all and all manner of debts, accompts, bargains, frauds, detaining of deeds, writings, muniments, and taking and detaining of beasts and cat∣tle, or goods; and all contracts whatsoever, arising within the said borough; and that such pleas, suits, and actions, be heard and terminated before the bailiffs, or one of them.</P>
<P>"THE aldermen are justices, and hold quarter sessions, in the same manner as county sessions are held by statute, to hear and deter∣mine causes; but not to proceed in case of death, or loss of life or limb.</P>
<P>"No country justice to intermeddle with any matters or things whatsoever, appertaining to the office of justice of the peace, which shall arise or happen within the borough.</P>
<L>"RESIANT burgesses are to serve upon jury at the sessions.</L>
<L>"THE aldermen and bailiffs are commissioners of array.</L>
<L>"THE resiant burgesses are voters for a member for the borough."</L>
<P>I CANNOT but record the virtue of those of the year 1572, who
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
had the courage to withstand the insinuations, the promises, and the threats, of as unprincipled a lord as this kingdom was ever afflicted with; who had power to inflict, and will to execute, any vengeance that opposition to his arbitrary inclinations might excite. In that year it was his pleasure that one <HI>Henry Dynne</HI> should represent this borough in parlement; the burgesses were refractory, and chose another person; which gave rise to the fol∣lowing letter, which I print, as a <HI>sans pareille.</HI></P>

<P>THIS doughty letter had no effect: the burgesses adhered to their own choice, and <HI>Richard Candishe,</HI> gent. stands as member for <HI>Denbigh</HI> in that year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis Notitiae Parliam.</HI> iii. 98.</NOTE>. <HI>Leicester</HI> did but copy his mistress in his contempt of privelege of parlements: <HI>Elizabeth</HI> thought them the mere instruments of giving sanction to her will: for if they once presumed to oppose it, she without ceremony informed them of her displeasure. <HI>Peter Wentworth,</HI> for the simple proposition, <Q>that a member of parlement might, without controlment of his person, or danger of the laws, by bill or speech, utter any of the griefs of this commonwealth whatsoever, touching the service of GOD, the safety of the prince, and this noble realm,</Q> was sent to the tower; and to the petition of the house for his release, an answer was returned, that it <HI>was very unfit for her majesty to give
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>

<P>FROM <HI>Denbigh</HI> I went to the hospitable house of <HI>Gwaenynog,</HI> about two miles distant, fronted by the most majestic oaks in our principality. The fine wooded dingles belonging to the demesne are extremely well worth visiting: they are most judiciously cut into walks by the owner, <HI>John Myddelton,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and afford as beautiful scenery in their kind, as any we have to boast. <HI>Moel Vamma</HI> superbly terminates one view; and the ruins of <HI>Denbigh Castle</HI> burst awfully at the termination of the concluding path.</P>
<P>IN rummaging over the family papers of this house, I met with an anecdote of it, too singular to be suppressed. It will prove at left, that private morals, and respect to the laws, were in that distant period but in a very low state; for no notice seems to have been taken of so atrocious an offence. The criminal en∣joyed the favor of the crown, in common with others its peaceful subjects.</P>
<P><HI>David Myddelton,</HI> who is styled receiver of <HI>Denbigh</HI> in the nine∣teenth of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and <HI>Valectus Coronae D<SUP>ni</SUP> Regis,</HI> in the second <HI>of Richard</HI> III. made his addresses to <HI>Elyn,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>John Done,</HI> of <HI>Utkinton,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and gained the lady's affections; but the parents preferred their relation, <HI>Richard Done,</HI> of <HI>Croton.</HI> The marriage was accordingly celebrated; which <HI>David</HI> having notice of, watched the groom leading his bride out of church,
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
killed him on the spot, and then carried away his mistress, and married her the same day; so that she was a maid, widow, and wife twice, in one day. From <HI>Roger,</HI> the eldest son of the match, descended the <HI>Myddeltons</HI> of this place.</P>
<P>I MENTION <HI>Thomas Myddelton,</HI> another of his progeny, only to prove, that the custom of the <HI>Irish</HI> howl, or <HI>Scotch Coranich,</HI> was in use among us; for we are told he was buried <HI>cum magno dolore et clamore cognatorum et propinquorum omnium.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING made <HI>Gwaenynog</HI> my head quarters for this neighbor∣hood, I one day visited from thence <HI>Henllan,</HI> the parish church of these parts; remarkable for the schism between church and steeple: the first having retreated into the bottom, the last maintains its sta∣tion on the top of the hill. The church is covered with shingles; a species of roof almost obsolete. <HI>St. Sadwrn,</HI> or <HI>St. Saturnus,</HI> cotem∣porary to <HI>St. Wenefrede,</HI> has it under his protection. Here was interred Sir <HI>Peter Mutton,</HI> knight, descended from <HI>Richard Mutton,</HI> of <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> and <HI>Elen,</HI> daughter to <HI>John (Aer Hên) Conway,</HI> of <HI>Bod∣rhyddan.</HI> Sir <HI>Peter,</HI> as his epitaph informs us, was chief justice of <HI>North Wales,</HI> a matter in chancery, prothonatory, and clerk of the crown. He died <HI>November</HI> the 4th, 1637. He had the ho∣nor of representing the borough of <HI>Caernarvon;</HI> and once occa∣sioned much diversion to the house, by asserting, in one of his speeches, "that he remembered fourteen years <HI>before</HI> he was he was born, &amp;c. &amp;c." But he was a good judge, made a fair fortune, and by marriage acquired the estate of <HI>Llanerch,</HI> which passed with his daughter to <HI>Robert Davies,</HI> of <HI>Gwysaney,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> ancestor of the present owner.</P>
<P>NOT far from <HI>Henllan</HI> church, in the parish of <HI>Llan-nefydd,</HI> on
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
the bank of the brook <HI>Meirchion,</HI> are the remains of a seat of <HI>Me∣reddydd ap Meirchion,</HI> or <HI>Merach y Meirch,</HI> lord of <HI>Isdulas.</HI> Part is now standing, particularly the chapel, which serves for a farm∣house; but some very extensive foundations shew its former im∣portance.</P>
<P>FROM hence, after a ride of a few miles, I reached <HI>Dyffryn Al∣led,</HI> or the vale of the river <HI>Alled,</HI> a very narrow tract, bounded by high hills, and of late ornamented by the magnificent seat built by Mrs. <HI>Meyric.</HI> At the head of the valley stand the village and church of <HI>Llansannan,</HI> dedicated to <HI>St. Sannan,</HI> confessor and hermit; descended (for our very saints boast of their pedegree) from antient parentage, near the territory of the father of <HI>St. We∣nefrede,</HI> with whom he maintained strict friendship. Their re∣mains were both enterred at <HI>Gwytherin;</HI> to which place, though unworthy, I resolved on an immediate pilgrimage.</P>
<P>IN my way, I descended a very steep wooded dell, in the town∣ship of <HI>Penared,</HI> to visit the gloomy cataract of <HI>Llyn yr ogo,</HI> where the <HI>Alled</HI> tumbles into a horrible black cavern, overshaded by oaks. Somewhat higher up is another, exposed to full day, falling from a vast height, and dividing the naked glen. <HI>Llyn-Alled,</HI> the small lake from which the river flows, lies at a small distance, amidst black and heathy mountains, through which runs much of the road to <HI>Gwytherin.</HI></P>
<P>THAT little village and church stand on a bank, at the head of a small vale, near the rise of the <HI>Elwy.</HI> The church is celebrated for the honor of having first received the remains of <HI>St. Winefrede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. WINEFREDE.</NOTE> after her second death. On the decease of <HI>St. Beuno,</HI> she was warned by a voice to call on <HI>St. Deifer</HI> at <HI>Bodvari;</HI> by <HI>St. Deifer</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
she was directed to go to <HI>St. Saturnus,</HI> at <HI>Henllan;</HI> and by <HI>St. Sa∣turnus,</HI> to seek a final retreat with <HI>St. Elerius,</HI> at <HI>Gwytherin.</HI> Hi∣ther she repaired, found a convent of nuns, received the veil from the saint, and, on the death of the abbess <HI>Theonia,</HI> succeeded to the high charge. <HI>St. Wenefrede</HI> died on the 3d of <HI>November,</HI> and rested here in quiet, near the body of her predecessor, for the space of five hundred years. By reason of a miracle, wrought, as was supposed, by her intercession, on a monk of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> the abbot determined on the translation of her remains to their mo∣nastery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HER REMAINS TRANSLATED.</NOTE> Seven holy men were deputed: the inhabitants of <HI>Gwytherin</HI> refused to part with such a treasure: visions deter∣mined the former to persist in their request: and at length, on the declaration of the will of heaven, by another vision, to the parson of <HI>Gwytherin,</HI> who declared to his flock the impiety of far∣ther resistance, the reliques were delivered up, and carried with triumph to their place of destination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, and much more, may be seen in the Life of <HI>St. Winefrede,</HI> pp. 38, &amp;c.</NOTE> The prior at this time was <HI>Robert.</HI> Mr. <HI>William Mytton</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Antiquities of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> folio MS.</NOTE> calls him <HI>Pennant.</HI> If he was of the neighborhood of <HI>Holywell,</HI> I do not wonder he was so anxious about the remains of his countrywoman, which he knew could not fail enriching his house, by virtue of the miracle-craft so frequent in that age.</P>
<P>IN the church is shewn the box in which her reliques were kept, before their removal to <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> Here is also an antient grave∣stone, with a flowery cross and <HI>chalice</HI> (the last denoting the

priestly profession of the deceased) with <HI>Hic jacet Llowarch Mab Cadell,</HI> inscribed on the cross.</P>
<P>THE Saint's Chapel, <HI>Capell Gwenfrewi,</HI> is now totally destroyed: it stood on the south side of the church; but nothing remains: except some slight ditches and foundations.</P>
<P>ON the north side of the church-yard stand four rude upright stones. On one is rudely cut an inscription, for which I refer to the supplemental plates.</P>
<P>IN my return, I followed the course of the <HI>Elwy,</HI> by <HI>Havodynos,</HI> the seat of <HI>Howel Lloyd,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> by the church and village of <HI>Llangerniew;</HI> by <HI>Garthewin,</HI> the seat of <HI>Robert Wynn,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> command∣ing a most lovely view of a fertile little valley, bounded by hills covered with hanging woods; and by <HI>Llanvair Dôlhaearn,</HI> a vil¦lage and church at a small distance above the conflux of the <HI>Elwy</HI> and <HI>Alled.</HI> In this parish above the <HI>Elwy,</HI> was one of the resi∣dences of <HI>Hedd Molwynog,</HI> descended from RODERIC THE GREAT king of all <HI>Wales.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">YR HEN LLYS.</NOTE> A large moat, called <HI>Yr Hén Llys,</HI> marks th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place: as the field, styled <HI>Maes y Bendithion,</HI> does the spot wher the poor received his alms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Llwyd's Itin.</HI> i. 14.

<P>IN the last century, the castle was garrisoned by the loyalists,

As a church∣man, he acquired great fame by his translation of the epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> being assistant in the version of the bible into <HI>English:</HI> as a philanthropist, his foundation of a hospital for twelve poor people, and a warden (who is the clergyman of the place) perpetuates his benevolent turn: and his affection to learned men is evident, not only by his establishing here a free school for this parish, and that of <HI>Llan-Elidan,</HI> with a stipend to the master of sixty pounds a year; but by his being the patron of the great <HI>Cambden</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden Middlesex,</HI> i, 385.</NOTE>, whom he enabled to take those travels, which produced the finest collection of provincial antiquities ever extant.</P>

<P>THE apartments of the priests were connected to the church by a cloister; part of which is built up, and serves as the man∣sion of the warden.

<P>FROM <HI>Ruthin.</HI> I visited the neat little mother church of <HI>Llan∣ruth,</HI> dedicated to <HI>St. Meugan,</HI> a great astrologer, and physician to king <HI>Vortigern.</HI> In it is the monument of <HI>John Thelwall,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Bathavarn,</HI> and his wife, kneeling at an altar: behind him are ten sons<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Several of their portraits are preserved at <HI>Bathavarn,</HI> the seat of the reverend Mr. <HI>Carter.</HI></NOTE>; behind her, four daughters. Of the sons, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> is armed; the rest are in gowns; and three carry in their hands a skull, to denote their early departure. The other seven lived
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
to advanced life, and flourished cotemporaries in the several pro∣fessions they had embraced.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> the eldest, died aged 97, and left a posterity, amounting to between two hundred and forty and two hundred and sixty.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Eubule</HI> became master of <HI>Jesus College, Oxford.</HI> I will not tire the reader with the whole family history; but must not omit <HI>Ambrose,</HI> the ninth son, who began life with being servant to Sir <HI>Francis Bacon;</HI> and so great a favorite was he, that in order to reward him, Sir <HI>Francis</HI> moved his royal master to knight all the masters in chancery; for which <HI>Ambrose</HI> was to have a gratuity of one hundred pounds a man. The affair was done, and the money paid, except by his brother, Sir <HI>Eubule,</HI> then one of the masters, to whom he remitted the fees.</P>
<P>THERE is in the church a monumental bust of <HI>Ambrose,</HI> admi∣rably cut: his hair short; beard, peaked; and ruff, flat.</P>
<P>THIS family came from <HI>Thelwall,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and took their name from the place. The founder was a follower of <HI>Reginald de Grey,</HI> and made a settlement in these parts. Notwithstanding the numerous offspring of the family, and the other branches, only two remain of the name, my kinsman, <HI>Edward Thelwall,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Llanbeder,</HI> a most beautiful situation, high on the side of the hills, two miles east of <HI>Ruthin;</HI> and <HI>Simon Thelwall,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Blaen-yâl.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Llanruth</HI> the vale grows very narrow, and almost closes with the parish of <HI>Llanvair.</HI> If I place the extremity at <HI>Pont Newydd,</HI> there cannot be a more beautiful finishing; where the bridge, near the junction of the <HI>Clwyd</HI> and the <HI>Hespin;</HI> and a lofty hill, with its cloathed with hanging woods, terminate the view.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="63"/>Go over part of <HI>Coed Marchan,</HI> a large naked common, noted for a quarry of coarse red and white marble. Descend into the narrow vale of <HI>Nant-clwyd;</HI> and for some time ride over dreary commons. On one is a small encampment, with a single foss, called <HI>Caer Senial.</HI> Near this place, enter MEIREONEDDSHIRE. And, within sight of the former, visit <HI>Caer Drewyn,</HI> another post, in full view of the beautiful vales of <HI>Glyn-dwrdwye</HI> and <HI>Edernion,</HI> watered by the <HI>Dee.</HI> It lies on the steep slope of a hill; is of a circular form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRITISH POST.</NOTE> and about half a mile in circumference; and the defence consists of a single wall, mostly in ruins; yet in some parts the facings are still apparent: in the thickness of the walls are evident remains of apartments. It had two entrances. Near the north-eastern is an oblong square, added to the main works; and as the ground there is rather flat, it is strengthened with a great ditch, and a wall: within are the foundations of rude stone buildings; one of which is circular, and several yards in diameter: the ditch is carried much farther than the wall; and seems part of an unfinished addition to the whole. It is conjec∣tured, that <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> occupied this post, while <HI>Henry</HI> II. lay encamped on the <HI>Berwyn</HI> hills, on the other side of the vale. <HI>Owen Glyndwr</HI> is said also to have made use of this fastness, in his occasional retreats.</P>
<P>NOT far from hence, near <HI>Gwyddelwern,</HI> is a place called <HI>Saith Marchog,</HI> from the circumstance of <HI>Owen</HI> having there surprized <HI>Reginald de Grey,</HI> and <HI>seven</HI> knights <HI>(Saith Marchog)</HI> in his train<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="64"/>THIS post or fastness of <HI>Caer Drewyn,</HI> is but one of the chain which begins at <HI>Diserth,</HI> and is continued along the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills into the mountains of <HI>Yale;</HI> for on the last are others; one on a <HI>Moel y Gaer,</HI> and another on <HI>Moel Forfydd;</HI> and <HI>Bryn Eglwys</HI> church seems to have been placed in the area of a third. These were the temporary retreats of the inhabitants in time of war, or sudden invasions: here they placed their women, their children, and cattle, under strong garrison; or perhaps a whole clan or nation might withdraw into them, till the retreat of the enemy, who could never subsist long in a country, where all the provisions were in this manner secured. It is also equally cer∣tain, that the inhabitants themselves could not remain here for any long space, as most of these fastnesses are destitute of water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> i. 414.</NOTE>.</P>

These appear to me to have been the graves of the slain in some skirmish which the <HI>Welsh</HI> had with the <HI>English,</HI> about the year 1255; when <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffyd,</HI> collecting all his power, recovered the inland part of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and all <HI>Merioneddshire,</HI> from the usurpation of <HI>Henry</HI> III.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 320.</NOTE>.</P>

to be seen in the garden. Notwithstanding his eminent success, he fell into a long captivity, being here betrayed into the hands of <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Belesme</HI> earl of <HI>Shrews∣bury,</HI> and was conveyed to the castle of <HI>Chester,</HI> where he endured a twelve years imprisonment. At length he was released by the bravery of a young man of these parts, <HI>Kynwric Hîr;</HI> who, com∣ing to <HI>Chester</HI> under pretence of buying necessaries, took an op∣portunity, while the keepers were a feasting, to carry away his prince, loaden with irons, on his back, to a place of security<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Gr. ap Conan.

<P>IN after-times, this place became the property of <HI>Owen Bro∣gyntyn,</HI> natural son of <HI>Madog ap Mereddydd,</HI> a prince of <HI>Powys.</HI> Such was the merit of <HI>Brogyntyn,</HI> that he shared his father's in∣heritance equal with his legitimate brethren. His dagger, cu∣riously wrought, is, I am told, still preserved in the house.

<P>I MAY mention here, as a sequel to the life of <HI>Owen Glyndwr,</HI> that on his attainder, <HI>Henry</HI> IV. sold the lordship of <HI>Glyndwrdwy</HI> to <HI>Robert Salusbury</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 214.</NOTE>, of <HI>Rûg.</HI></P>
<P>CROSS the <HI>Dee,</HI> on a very handsome bridge of six arches, from which the river shews itself to vast advantage, above and below, in form of two extensive channels, bordered by trees, and ferti∣lizing a verdant tract of meadow.</P>
<P>REACH <HI>Corwen,</HI> whose church and small town, seated beneath a
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
vast rock at the foot of the <HI>Berwyn</HI> hills, form a picturesque point of view, from various parts of the preceding ride.</P>
<P><HI>Corwen</HI> is celebrated for being the great rendezvous of the <HI>Welsh</HI> forces under <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord LITTLETON, iv. 99.</NOTE>, who from hence put a stop to the invasion of <HI>Henry</HI> II. in the year 1165. The place of en∣campment is marked, as I am told, by a rampart of earth, above the church southward; and by the marks of the sites of abundance of tents from thence to the village of <HI>Cynwyd.</HI></P>
<P>THE church is built in form of a cross. Within is the tomb of one of its vicars, <HI>Jorwerth Sulien.</HI> His figure, holding a cha∣lice in his hand, is represented as low as his breast, over which the inscription, <HI>"Hie jacet Jorwerth Sulien, Vicarius de Corvaen, ora pro eo,"</HI> is continued. The whole is a very elegant piece of engraving, upon the coffin-lid, I fear not old enough to make it the tomb of <HI>St. Julien,</HI> archbishop of <HI>St. David;</HI> the godliest man and greatest clerke in all <HI>Wales</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He died in 1089.</NOTE>: yet that saint has his well here, and is patron of the church.</P>
<P>ON the south side of the church wall is cut a very rude cross, which is shewn to strangers as the sword of <HI>Owen Glyndwr.</HI> A most singular cross in the church-yard merits attention: the shast is let into a flat stone, and that again is supported by four or five rude stones, as if the whole had been formed in imitation of, and in veneration of the sacred <HI>Cromlehs</HI> of very early time.</P>
<P>A MONUMENT of our superstition remains in the <HI>Carreg y Big yn y fach Newlyd,</HI> a pointed rude stone, which stands near the porch. We are told that all attempts to build the church in any other place, were frustrated by the influence of certain adverse
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
powers, till the founders, warned in vision, were directed to the spot where this pillar stood.</P>
<P>IN the church-yard is a building, founded by <HI>William Eyton,</HI> of <HI>Plâs Warren,</HI> in <HI>Shropshire;</HI> who, in 1709, left by will a sum for the support of six widows of clergy of the county of <HI>Merioneth</HI> only, and for the erecting six houses for them to live in. In con∣sequence, this building was finished, and lands, to the present amount of sixty pounds a year, bought, which is equally divided among the widows resident here.</P>
<P>LEAVE <HI>Corwen,</HI> and return as far as the bridge on the way I came. The vast <HI>Berwyn</HI> mountains are the eastern boundary of this beautiful vale. Their highest tops are <HI>Cader Fronwen,</HI> or <HI>The White Breast,</HI> and <HI>Cader Ferwyn.</HI> On the first is a great heap of stones, brought from some distant part, with great toil, up the steep ascent; and in their middle is an erect pillar. Of him, whose ambition climbed this height for a monument, we are left in ignorance. Under their summit is said to run an artificial road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FFORD HELEN.</NOTE> called <HI>Ffordd Helen,</HI> or <HI>Helen's Way;</HI> a lady, of whose labors I shall soon have occasion to speak further.</P>
<P>ON these hills, particularly about <HI>Cader Fronwen,</HI> is found the <HI>Rubus Chamaemorus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLOUD BERRIES.</NOTE> Cloud Berries,</HI> or <HI>Knot Berries.

<P>REACH <HI>Cynwyd,</HI> a small village, formerly noted for the courts kept here by the great men of the neighborhood, to settle the boundaries of their several clames on the wastes and commons, and to take cognizances of the encroachment; but they have been long discontinued, and the records destroyed.</P>
<P>VISIT from this place <HI>Rhaider Cynwyd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WATTER-FALL.</NOTE> or the fall of <HI>Cynwyd,</HI> which finely finishes the end of the dingle, that extends about half a mile from the village. The water of the river <HI>Trystion</HI> bursts from the sides of the hill, through deep and narrow chasms, from rock to rock, which are overgrown with wood. The rude and antient stocks, that hang in many parts over the precipices, add much to this picturesque scene; which is still improved by the little mill, and its inhabitants, in this sequestered bottom.</P>
<P>PURSUE the journey to <HI>Bala.</HI> Go by the little church of <HI>Llangar.</HI> Observe somewhat farther on the left, in a field called <HI>Caer Bont,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAER BONT.</NOTE> a small circular entrenchment, consisting of a foss and rampart, with two entrances, meant probably as a guard to this pass. My fellow-traveller, the reverend Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> informed me, that in another tour he had ascended a hill, above this place, called <HI>Y Foel,</HI> on whose summit was a circular coronet, of rude pebbly stones, none above three feet in height; with an entrance to the east, or rising sun. The diameter of the circle is ten yards. Within was a circular cell, about six feet in diameter, sunk a very little below the surface; and about a hundred yards distance,
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>
facing this, are the reliques of a great <HI>Carnedd,</HI> surrounded by large stones. The whole of this formed a place of worship among the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> and probably was surrounded with a grove. But what I have to say on the subject of <HI>Druidism,</HI> is re∣served till I reach <HI>Anglesea,</HI> its principal seat.</P>
<P>PROCEED to <HI>Llandrillo,</HI> a village with a church dedicated to <HI>St. Trillo.</HI> It is seated on the torrent <HI>Keidio,</HI> at the mouth of a great glen, which extends upwards of two miles, embosomed in the <HI>Berwyn</HI> mountains, and leads to the noted pass through them, called <HI>Milter Gerrig,</HI> into the county of <HI>Montgomery.</HI></P>
<P>AT about a mile distance from <HI>Llandrillo,</HI> I again crossed the <HI>Dee,</HI> at <HI>Pont Gilan,</HI> a bridge of two arches, over a deep and black water. Beyond this spot, the valley acquires new beauties, espe∣cially on the right. The valley here contracts greatly: the road runs at the foot of a brow, of a stupendous height, covered with venerable oaks, which have kept their stubborn station, amidst the rudest of rocks, which every now and then shew their grey and broken fronts, amidst the deep verdure of the foliage of trees, which so strangely find nutriment amongst them. The growth of the oak, in forcing its root downward, frequently rends thse vast strata, whose fragments often appear scattered at the base, of most amazing sizes. The whole scenery requires the pencil of a <HI>Sal∣vator Rosa:</HI> and here our young artists would find a fit place to study the manner of that great painter of wild nature.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond the extremity of this romantic part, in an opening on the right,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. DERFEL.</NOTE> stand the church and village of <HI>Llan-Dder∣fel:</HI> the first was dedicated to <HI>St. Derfel Gadarn,</HI> and was re∣markable for a vast wooden image of the saint, the subject of
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>
much superstition in ancient times. The <HI>Welsh</HI> had a prophecy, that it should set a <HI>whole forest on fire.</HI> Whether to complete it, or whether to take away from the people the cause of idolatry, I cannot say; but it was brought to <HI>London</HI> in the year 1538, and was used as part of the fuel which consumed poor frier <HI>Forest</HI> to ashes, in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> for denying the king's supremacy. This un∣happy man was hanged in chains round his middle to a gallows, over which was placed this inscription, allusive to our image:

<P>THE prophecy was fulfilled, the image burnt, and <HI>the Forest</HI> consumed, to the great content of the lord mayor, the dukes of <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> the lord admiral, and lord privy seal, and di∣vers others of the nobility, who honored this <HI>auto de fe</HI> with their presence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow's Annals,</HI> 573.</NOTE>; but unfortunately, the frier not having the insensi∣bility
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
of our wooden saint, on the touch of the flames shewed the natural horrors at approach of an agonizing death, and payed very little respect to the arguments of the pious <HI>Latimer,</HI> who was placed opposite to the sufferer, in a pulpit, to preach him into a sense of the crime of differing in opinion with his sovereign in re∣ligious matters; for which the prelate himself suffered in a suc∣ceeding reign. <HI>Forest</HI> thought fit to deny that <HI>Henry</HI> was head of the church; and <HI>Latimer</HI> would force that honor upon <HI>Mary,</HI> who chose to cede it to the Pope.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to this church is <HI>Llandderfel</HI> bridge, of four arches. At some distance from it, the vale almost closes; and at <HI>Kalettur</HI> finishes nobly with a lofty wooded eminence, above which soars the vast mafs of the <HI>Arennig</HI> mountains, notwithstanding they ap∣pear immediately after to be very remote. And I here stop a mo∣ment, to recommend to the traveller, who does not chuse pre∣cisely to pursue my steps, to follow the course of the <HI>Dee</HI> from <HI>Bangor,</HI> through the delicious tract it waters from thence to <HI>Llangollen,</HI> to follow it through <HI>Glyndwrdwy</HI> to <HI>Corwen,</HI> and thence, through the matchless vale of <HI>Edeirneon,</HI> to this spot, where, for a small space, it passes through a flat, an unpleasant contrast to the preceding ride.</P>
<P>ON the left lies <HI>Rhiwaedog,</HI> or <HI>The Bloody Brow,</HI> noted for a battle between <HI>Llowarch</HI> Hên and the <HI>Saxons,</HI> in which he lost <HI>Cynddelw,</HI> the last of his numerous sons. A spot not far from hence, called <HI>Pabell Llowarch Hên,</HI> or the tent of that monarch, is supposed to have been the place where he rested the night after the battle, and where he finished that pathetic elegy, in which he laments the loss of all his sons. In it he directs the last to de∣fend
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
the brow of that hill, indifferent to the fate of the only survivor.

<P>THE house and estate of <HI>Rhiwaedog</HI> is now owned by Mr. <HI>Dolben,</HI> descended by his mother from the <HI>Llwyds,</HI> the very antient possessors. <HI>Eineon ap Ithel,</HI> of this place, a valiant ancestor of his, articled with <HI>John</HI> duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> in 1394, to attend him for a year in his expedition to <HI>Guyen,</HI> with one mam at arms and one archer; for which the duke rewarded him with twenty marks, issuing out of his manor of <HI>Halton</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Evan Evans</HI>'s Notes.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>REACH <HI>Bala,</HI> a small town in the parish of <HI>Llanyekil,</HI> noted for its vast trade in woollen stockings, and its great markets every <HI>Saturday</HI> morning, when from two to five hundred pounds worth are sold each day, according to the demand. Round the place, women and children are in full employ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">KNITTING.</NOTE> knitting along the roads; and mixed with them <HI>Herculean</HI> figures appear, assisting their <HI>om∣phales</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
in this effeminate employ. During winter the females, through love of society, often assemble at one another's houses to knit; sit round a fire, and listen to some old tale, or to some an∣tient song, or the sound of a harp; and this is called <HI>Cymmorth Gwau,</HI> or, the knitting assembly.</P>
<P>MUCH of the wool is bought at the great fairs at <HI>Llanrwst,</HI> in <HI>Denbighshire.</HI></P>
<P>CLOSE to the south-east end of the town, is a great artificial mount,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMMEN Y BALA.</NOTE> called <HI>Tommen y Bala,</HI> in the summer time usually covered in a picturesque manner with knitters, of both sexes, and all ages. From the summit is a fine view of <HI>Llyn-tegid,</HI> and the adjacent mountains. On the right appear the two <HI>Arennigs, Vawr</HI> and <HI>Vach;</HI> beyond the farther end, soar the lofty <HI>Arans,</HI> with their two heads, <HI>Aran Mowddwy</HI> and <HI>Penllyn;</HI> and beyond all, the great <HI>Cader Idris</HI> closes the view.</P>
<P>THIS mount appears to have been <HI>Roman,</HI> and placed here, with a castelet on its summit, to secure the pass towards the sea, and keep our mountaneers in subjection. The Welsh, in after time, took advantage of this, as well as other works of the same nature.</P>
<P>THE town is of a very regular form: the principal street very spacious, and the lesser fall into it at right angles. I will not deny, but that its origin might have been <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>THE mounts form a chain. I have observed one within sight of this, on the mountain road to <HI>Ruthin,</HI> which is called <HI>Tommen y Castell; Caer Crwyni</HI> is a small entrenchment, not remote from it, overlooking the vale of <HI>Edeirnion;</HI> the mount in the garden of <HI>Rûg</HI> is another; a third, much more considerable, lies within

<PB N="69" REF="75"/>sight of this, on the road to <HI>Gwyddelwern;</HI> and farther on, in the parish of Bettws, is a fourth, which goes under the usual name of <HI>Tommen y Castell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bala</HI> takes its name from its vicinity to the place where a river discharges itself from a lake. <HI>Balloch</HI> in the <HI>Erse</HI> language signi∣fies the same. I know little of its antient history, any more than it seems to have been dependent on the castle of <HI>Harlech;</HI> and that, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> II. it was committed to the care of <HI>Finian de Stanedon,</HI> constable of that castle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>; and in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. his great general, <HI>Walter de Manni,</HI> was rewarded with the fee-farm of <HI>Bala</HI> and <HI>Harlech,</HI> and was made sheriff of this county for life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Baron</HI> ii 149.</NOTE>. I may add incidentally, that <HI>Edward</HI> I. gave one <HI>Hugo de Turbervill</HI> liberty of hunting through <HI>Meirio∣nithshire</HI> all kinds of wild beasts<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rotulae Walliae,</HI> 98, In P 97 is an order for him to have six stags out of the forest of <HI>Meirionith.</HI></NOTE>, while probably the subdued natives were only his Chasseurs.</P>
<P><HI>Bala Lake, Pimble Mere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LAKS.</NOTE> or <HI>Llyn-tegid,</HI> lies at a small distance from the town; and is a fine expanse of water, near four miles long, and twelve hundred yards broad in the widest place: the deepest part is opposite <HI>Bryn Golen,</HI> where it is forty-six yards deep, with three yards of mud; the shores gravelly: the bounda∣ries are easy slopes, well cultivated, and varied with woods. In stormy weather, its billows run very high, and incroach greatly on the north-east end, where, within memory of man, numbers of acres have been lost. It rises sometimes nine feet, and rains and
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
winds jointly contribute to make it overflow the fair vale of <HI>Edeirnion.</HI></P>
<P>ITS fish are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH.</NOTE> pike, perch, trout, a few roach, and abundance of eels; and shoals of that <HI>Alpine</HI> fish, the <HI>Gwyniaid,</HI> which spawn in <HI>December,</HI> and are taken in great numbers in spring, or summer. Pike have been caught here of twenty-five pounds weight, a trout of twenty-two, a perch of ten, and a gwyniaid of five. Sir <HI>Wat∣kin Williams Wynn</HI> clames the whole fishery of this noble lake. It had been the property of the abby of <HI>Basingwerk;</HI> for <HI>Owen de Brogynton</HI> made a grant to GOD, <HI>St. Mary,</HI> and the monks of that house, of <Q>a certain water in <HI>Penthlinn,</HI> called <HI>Thlintegit,</HI> or <HI>Pembelmore,</HI> and all the pasture of the said land of <HI>Penthlinn.</HI></Q> This was witnessed by <HI>Reiner</HI> (who was bishop of <HI>St. Asaph</HI> from 1186 to 1224) and by <HI>Ithail, Owen</HI>'s chaplain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE waters are discharged under <HI>Pont Mwnwgl y Llyn,</HI> a bridge of three arches. They seem inconsiderable in respect to the size of the streams which feed the lake; for the <HI>Dee</HI> does not make in dry seasons the figure I expected. Salmon come in plenty to this place, but neither do they trespass into the lake, and the <HI>gwyniaids</HI> very rarely into the river. Report says, that the <HI>Dee</HI> passes through the lake from end to end, without deigning to mix its waters; as the <HI>Rhone</HI> was fabled to serve the lake of Ge∣neva. But, in fact, the <HI>Dee</HI> does not assume its name, till it quits its parent.</P>
<P>NEAR the west side, close to the bridge, and just opposite to <HI>Tommen y Bala,</HI> stood another castelet; not so high, but of a more extensive form than that mount. It is now broke through by a
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
public road, but is very apparent on both sides. The mount, or keep, was on the lower, immediately above the river; and the vestiges of a wall are still evident. This was subservient to the same purposes as the others; for there must have been, from the nature of the ground, a travellable road on both sides of the lake. This I apprehend to have been the castle of <HI>Bala,</HI> which <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth</HI> founded in 1202<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 258.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is no river in <HI>England</HI> which has been so much cele∣brated by our poets, for its sanctity, <NOTE PLACE="marg">THR DLF, SACRED</NOTE> as the <HI>Dee.</HI> Most countries had one, which they held in peculiar veneration. The <HI>Thessalians</HI> paid divine honors to their <HI>Paeneus,</HI> on account of its beauty: the <HI>Scythians</HI> worshipped their Ister, on account of its size: the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> because it was the judge whether their offspring was legitimate; for the spurious sunk, the lawful floated<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cluverius Germ. Antiq.</HI> lib. i. 185.</NOTE>: and let me add to the list, the <HI>Ganges,</HI> out of whose waters no <HI>Indian</HI> of a certain sect would willingly yield his last. breath. Our river foretold events by the change of its channel<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Girald. Camb, Itin. <HI>c. xi.</HI></NOTE>; and it often seemed miracu∣lously to increase, without the usual intervention of rains; therefore, in all probability, derived its name, not from <HI>Ddu,</HI> or black, because its waters are not so, except in parts, by reason of the depth; nor from <HI>Dwy,</HI> two, because it does not appear to flow from any two particular fountains; but from Duw, <HI>divine,</HI> by reason of its wondrous attributes. Our original stock, the <HI>Gauls,</HI> deified foun∣tains, lakes, and rivers. They even had one, which in theirs (our
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
primitive tongue) bore the same name, and was called (Latinised) into <HI>Divona.</HI>

<P><HI>Giraldus,</HI> who travelled through our country in 1188, gives the first account of the prophetic quality of the <HI>Dee;</HI> and the notion was continued to many ages after his. <HI>Spencer</HI> introduces it among the rivers attendant on the marriage of the <HI>Thames</HI> and the Medway<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stanza 39, cant. xi, lib. iv.</NOTE>:

<P>BUT <HI>Draiton</HI> is still more particular, and adds many of its pre∣saging qualities, delivered down to him from the more antient times.
<Q><L>Again <HI>Dee</HI>'s holiness began</L>
<L>By his contracted front and sterner waves to show,</L>
<L>That he had things to speak that profit them to know:</L>
<L>A brook that was suppos'd much business to have seen,</L>

<L>And noted was by both to be an ominous flood,</L>
<L>That changing of his fords, the future ill or good</L>
<L>Of either country told; of either's war or peace;</L>

<P><PB N="73" REF="79"/>WELL, therefore, might the sacred rivers be called URBIS GENII; and that ours was as deserving as the best of them of that title, is evinced from the above. Finally, <HI>Milton,</HI> in the follow∣ing line, beautifully alludes to the interpreters of the presages among the <HI>Britons,</HI> the antient <HI>Druids,</HI> who dwelt upon its banks:
<Q>Nor yet where DEVA spreads her wizard fstream<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lycidas.</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P>IT was long before we got clear of these superstitions. They were very prevalent in the time of <HI>Gildas,</HI> in the sixth century, when our ancestors strongly retained the idolatry of the <HI>Druids</HI> among their <HI>Christian</HI> rites: and, notwithstanding the fulmination of many a monarch<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edgar and Canute.</NOTE>, it kept its ground; and hydromancy still remains practised among us; of which I shall have occasion to speak of more than one kind.</P>
<P>I FOUND that I could here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">KERRIG Y DRU∣IDION</NOTE> with greater ease than from any other place, digress to <HI>Kerrig y Druidion;</HI> a parish a few miles to the north, in the county of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> noted for certain <HI>Druidical</HI> remains, which gave name to the place. After a dreary ride, I found myself disappointed; these sacred reliques having been profanely carried away, and converted into a wall. It is therefore from the annotator on <HI>Cambden</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">II. 813.</NOTE>, and the drawings preserved by him among the <HI>Sebright</HI> MSS. that I must form my description.</P>
<P>THE largest was a fine specimen of the <HI>British Kist vaen,</HI> or stone chest. It consisted of one stone at top, placed inclining to the north, and was, when measured by Mr. <HI>Llwyd,</HI> ten feet long, supported by a stone on each side about seven feet long, and near
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
two and a half broad. Under one end was a stone, three feet long; at the other, one of the length of two feet. The hollow beneath was only seven feet long, three and a half broad, and only two and a half high; which sufficiently shews, that these mo∣numents had not been the cells of <HI>Druids;</HI> their uses, therefore, must: have been sepulchral, according to the conjecture of Doctor <HI>Borlase.</HI> The antient natives of our isle did not always burn their dead. Skeletons have been discovered in similar <HI>Kist vaens,</HI> at full length: in such as this, they might lie commodiously, with all the parade of arms, often buried with them. Around this, was a circle of stones, inclosing an area of about forty paces in diameter; and the precinct might be formed with the intent of keeping people at a respectable distance from the remains, per∣haps of some mighty chieftain. This monument went by the name of <HI>Karchar Kynric Rwth;</HI> not that it ever was used for that purpose originally; but there is a tradition, that in aftertimes, a little tyrant of that name, in the neighborhood, was wont to cram those who offended him, into the hollow of these stones; which might serve for the purposes of torment as well as the <HI>little ease</HI> in the tower of <HI>London,</HI> or the iron cages of the <HI>Bastille.</HI></P>
<P>THE other <HI>Kist vaen</HI> was nearly similar to the first; but no mention is made of the circle of stones: probably they were taken away before Mr. <HI>Llwyd</HI> visited the place.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Giler,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BARON PRICE.</NOTE> in this parish, was born that upright and able judge; <HI>Robert Price,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> baron of the exchequer, and finally justice of the common pleas. His famous speech in the house of com∣mons, against the grant of the great <HI>Welsh</HI> lordships to the earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> will ever testify his love to his country. His speedy
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
promotion by king <HI>William,</HI> do equal credit to his majesty, and Mr. <HI>Price;</HI> since the former, howsoever grievous to him might be the opposition to his will, yet no consideration could induce him to permit his subjects to lose the benefit of a magistrate ca∣pable and honest, as he knew our countryman to be.</P>
<P>RETURN to <HI>Bala,</HI> and continue my journey on the south side of the lake, a most beautiful ride. Pass by <HI>Llanyckil</HI> church, dedi∣cated to <HI>St. Beuno;</HI> and see, on the opposite side, <HI>Llangower,</HI> de∣dicated to <HI>St. Gwawr,</HI> mother of the <HI>Cambrian</HI> bard <HI>Llowarch Hên.</HI> Beneath flows <HI>Avon Gwawr,</HI> the only feed of the lake on that side.</P>
<P>Go by <HI>Glan y Llyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GLAN Y LLYN.</NOTE> an old house, near the water edge; which, as well as the following, had been the property of the <HI>Vaughans.</HI></P>
<P>LEAVE on the right another antient seat, <HI>Caer Gai,</HI> placed on an eminence. <HI>Cambden</HI> says, it was a castle, built by one <HI>Caius,</HI> a <HI>Roman;</HI> the <HI>Britons</HI> ascribe it to <HI>Gai,</HI> foster-brother to king <HI>Ar∣thur.</HI> It probably was <HI>Roman,</HI> for multitudes of coins have been found in different parts of the neighborhood; and it is certain, that it had been a fortress to defend this pass, for which it is well adapted, both by situation, and form of the hill.</P>
<P>I PROCEEDED about two miles farther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL CORN∣DOCHON.</NOTE> to visit another, seated a mile from the <HI>Dolgelleu</HI> road, on the summit of a high rock, which bears the name of <HI>Castell Corndochon,</HI> the origin of which we are equally ignorant of. Two sides of the rock are precipitous. In the front of the castle is cut a deep foss: the castle consisted of an oblong tower, rounded at the extremity; and its measure within is forty-three feet by twenty-two. Behind that, and joined to it by a wall, are the ruins of a square tower; this lies in the main
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
body of the fortress, whose form, as <HI>Cambden</HI> observes, inclines to oval. This had been very considerable; was built with mortar, made of gravel and sea shells; and was faced with free-stone, squared, and well cut.</P>
<P>I RETURNED towards <HI>Caer Gai;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLAN∣UWCHLLYN.</NOTE> and, not far from thence, to the village and <HI>church</HI> of <HI>Llan-uwchllyn.</HI> In the last is the figure of an armed man, with a conic helmet, and mail muffler round his chin and neck: on his breast is a wolf's head, and on his belly another; and in the intervening space, three roses. The first are the arms of <HI>Ririd Vlaidd;</HI> the others of <HI>Kynedda Wledig,</HI> or, <HI>The Warlike,</HI> a <HI>Cumbrian</HI> prince, whose sons (after their father had been defeated by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> in the sixth century) retired, and possessed themselves of these parts of <HI>Wales:</HI> and from <HI>Mei∣rion,</HI> a grandson of his, is said to be given the name of <HI>Meirionith</HI> to this shire. <HI>Ririd</HI> was lord of <HI>Pen-Llyn,</HI> which signifies the head of the lake, and forms one of the hundreds of <HI>Meirionithshire.</HI> It had also its castle, which probably was that of <HI>Corndochon.</HI> Around the margin of the tomb is a mutilated inscription, which, as far as I could discover, run thus: <HI>Hic jacet Johannes ap * * * * ap Madoc ap J—eth, cujus animae pr—etur. Deus amen. anno. D<SUP>•i</SUP></HI> MCCC. V. 88.</P>
<P>CLOSE by this village runs <HI>Avon-y-Llan, Avon Llew,</HI> or <HI>Amlêw.</HI> The last rises from two springs, and falls into the former. Those who chuse to derive the <HI>Dee</HI> from its double origin, may fix on these: but I met with a third, at the farthest corner of the lake, arising from the neighborhood of the lofty <HI>Aran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ARAN HI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> to which <HI>Spencer</HI> gives the honor of forming that celebrated river, I suppose after running through the lake, unmixed with the waters. The poet
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
makes the foot of that mighty mountain the place of education of our renowned prince, <HI>Arthur;</HI> who, on his birth, being deli∣vered to a fairy knight, is by him instantly conveyed to an antient hero,
<Q>To be upbrought in gentle thews and martial might.</Q></P>
<P>IT is evident that <HI>Spencer,</HI> who was deeply read in all the ro∣mance of his romantic days, had heard the tradition of <HI>Caer Gai,</HI> and its old inhabitant, <HI>Gai</HI>'s father, to whom he chuses to give the more classical name of <HI>Timon;</HI> for so prince <HI>Arthur</HI> is made to name his foster-father.</P>
<P><Q><L>Unto old <HI>Timon</HI> he me brought bylive,</L>

<P>THIS honored stream is now known by the name of <HI>Avon Twrch;</HI> is a fierce mountain torrent, precipitating itself from the <HI>Aran;</HI> and crosses a road from whence I first begin my journey among the <HI>Alps</HI> of our country, and ascend from hence, then sink into very deep bottoms, bounded on each side by fields of such steepness, as to put the inhabitants to great difficulties in the cul∣tivation. Woods, especially of birch, vary the scene. On the right,
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
tower the vast hills of <HI>Aran;</HI> or rather, two heads, arising from one base.</P>
<P>ARRIVE at the foot of <HI>Bwlch y Groes,</HI> or the pass of <HI>The Cross,</HI> one of the most terrible in <HI>North Wales.</HI> The height is gained by going up an exceeding steep and narrow zig-zag path: the pass itself is a dreary heathy flat, on which I suppose the cross stood, to excite the thanksgiving of travellers, for having so well accomplished their arduous journey. The descent on the other side, is much greater, and very tedious, into the long and narrow vale of <HI>Mowddwy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VALE OF MOWDDWY.</NOTE> It is seven or eight miles long; and so contracted, as scarcely to admit a meadow at the bottom. Its boundaries are vast hills, generally very verdant, and fine sheep walks; but one on the left exhibits a horrible front, being so steep, as to balance between precipice and slope: it is red and naked, and too steep to admit of vegetation; and a slide from its summit would be as fatal as a fall from a perpendicular rock. In one place on the right, the mountains open, and furnish a gap to give sight to another picturesque and strange view, the rugged and wild summit of <HI>Aran Mowddwy,</HI> which soars above with tre∣mendous majesty.</P>
<P>THERE is a beauty in this vale, which is not frequent in others of these mountanous countries. The inclosures are all divided by excellent quickset hedges, and run far up the sides of the hills, in places so steep, that the common traveller would scarcely find footing. Numbers of little groves are interspersed; and the hills above them shew a fine turf to the top, where the bog and heath commence, which give shelter to multitudes of red grous, and a few black. But their consequences to these parts are infinitely
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
greater, in being the beds of fuel to all the inhabitants. The turberies are placed very remote from their dwellings; and the turf, or peat, is gotten with great difficulty. The roads from the brows of the mountains, in general, are too steep even for a horse;<NOTE PLACE="marg">TURF SLEDGES</NOTE> the men therefore carry up on their backs, a light sledge, fill it with a very considerable load, and drag it, by means of a rope placed over their breast, to the brink of the slope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this time the turberies lie at a great distance from the brow of the hill; the natives are therefore obliged to bring a horse by a round-about way to them, which assists in dragging the turf to the brink of the slope, where men supply its place.</NOTE>; then go before, and draw it down, still preceding, and guiding its mo∣tions, which at times have been so violent, as to overturn and draw along with it the master, to the hazard of his life, and not without considerable bodily hurt.</P>
<P>AFTER riding some time along the bottom of the vale, pass by the village and church of <HI>Llan y Mowddwy;</HI> the last is dedicated to <HI>St. Tydecho,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. TYDECHO.</NOTE> one of our most capital saints. His legend<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gywydd y</HI> DYDDECHO SANT yn amser MEALGWIN GWYNEDD; <HI>i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> the poem of <HI>St. Tydecho,</HI> who lived in the time of <HI>Malgwyn Gwynedd.</HI></NOTE> is written in verse, by <HI>Dafydd Llwyd ap Llewelyn ap Gryffydd,</HI> lord of <HI>Mathafarn;</HI> a person who had a great hand in bringing in <HI>Henry</HI> VII, by feeding his countrymen with prophecies, that one of them was to deliver <HI>Wales</HI> from the <HI>English</HI> yoke, by which means thousands of them were induced to rise, under Sir <HI>Rhys ap Thomas,</HI> and join <HI>Henry,</HI> then earl of <HI>Richmond,</HI> at <HI>Milford.</HI></P>
<P>THIS illustrious bard informs us, that <HI>Tydecho</HI> had been an ab∣bot in <HI>Armorica,</HI> and came over here in the time of king <HI>Arthur;</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>
but after the death of that hero, when the <HI>Saxons</HI> over-ran most of the kingdom, the saint retired, and led here a most austere life, lying on the bare stones, and wearing a shirt of hair: yet he employed his time usefully, was a tiller of the ground, and kept hospitality. <HI>Malgwyn Gwynedd,</HI> then a youth, took offence at the saint, and seized his oxen; but wild stags were seen the next day, performing their office, and a grey wolf harrowing after them. <HI>Malgwyn,</HI> enraged at this, brought his milk-white dogs to chace the deer, while he sat on the blue stone, to enjoy the di∣version; but when he attempted to rise, he found his breech im∣moveably fixed to the rock, so that he was obliged to beg pardon of the saint, who, on proper reparation, was so kind as to free him from his aukward pain.</P>
<P>So far legend. That <HI>St. Tydecho</HI> might have lived, and that <HI>Malgwyn Gwynedd</HI> did live a prince of our country, I make no doubt; and that the former did receive from the prince the pri∣vileges it once enjoyed, of sanctuary for man and beast, is equally probable: every offender, however criminal, met with protection here. Legend says, that it was to endure for a hundred ages; but, blind to futurity! the reformation was not foreseen. This place was also exempted from all fighting, burning, and killing; nor was it permitted to affront any of the inhabitants, without making the most ample reparation.</P>
<P>THE lands of <HI>Tydecho</HI> were also freed from mortuaries, clames, oppression, and that great duty, which most places were subject to, the <HI>Gobr Merched,</HI> the penalty of incontinence; which the saint, in tenderness to the possible frailty of his flock, wisely took care to get it exempted from.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="87"/>ABOUT four or five miles farther, I reached <HI>Dinas y Mowydwy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DINAS MOWD∣DWY.</NOTE> seated on the plain of an eminence, at the junction of three vales, beneath the rock <HI>Craig y Dinas;</HI> whose peat paths I now survey with horror, reflecting on a frolick of my younger days, in climbing to its summit, to enjoy the pleasure of darting down again in one of the peat sledges. The foot of this eminence is watered by the <HI>Kerris</HI> and the <HI>Dyfi.</HI> The last, which retains its name till lost in the sea at <HI>Aberdyfi,</HI> rises at the bottom of the rude rock <HI>Craig Llyn Dyfi,</HI> under <HI>Aran Mowddwy.</HI> It abounds with salmon, which are hunted in the night, by an animated, but illicit chace, by spear∣men, who are directed to the fish by lighted whisps of straw.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Mowddwy,</HI> notwithstanding it is dignified with the name of <HI>Dinas,</HI> or city, consists but of one street, strait and broad, with houses ill according with its title; but it still preserves the in∣signia of power, the stocks, and whipping-post, the <HI>vag-vawr,</HI> or great fetter, the mace, and standard measure. It is likewise the capital of an extensive lordship, under the rule of my worthy cousin, <HI>John Mytton,</HI> esquire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OWNERS.</NOTE> He derives it from <HI>William,</HI> or <HI>Wil∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cke,</HI> as he is commonly called, fourth son of <HI>Gryffyd ap Gwen∣wynwyn,</HI> lord of <HI>Powis.</HI> His grand-daughter and sole heir mar∣ried Sir <HI>Hugh de Burgh,</HI> son of the famous <HI>Hugh,</HI> justiciary of <HI>England.</HI> His son, Sir <HI>John,</HI> left four daughters, married into the houses of <HI>Newport, Leighton, Lingen,</HI> and <HI>Mytton; Alianor,</HI> the fourth daughter, having given her hand, and this seignory, to <HI>Thomas Mytton,</HI> ancestor of the present lord.</P>
<P>THE powers of this capital over a district,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIVILEGES.</NOTE> which comprehends this large parish, and seven out of the eight townships of that of <HI>Mallwyd,</HI> are considerable. The corporation consists of a mayor,
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
aldermen, recorder, and several burgesses. The mayor tries crimi∣nals; but, as the late worthy magistrate, a very honest smith, told me, that, for some years past, they have not adventured to whip; the stocks, or confinement in the <HI>vag-vawr,</HI> is the utmost severity they have exerted: but then they retain the exclusive power of licensing ale-houses in their district, and are likewise justices of the peace as far as the limits of their little reign.</P>
<P>THE recorder (in absence of the lord) tries all matters of pro∣perty, not exceeding forty shillings; and the attornies, whose fees do not exceed half a crown, are chosen from the lettered part of the community, or those who can read.</P>
<P>I WAS accommodated with entertainment at the manor-house, from whence I took a delightful walk of about two miles, along the vale, on the banks of the <HI>Dyvi.</HI> The valley expands, and the hills sink in height, towards the west. After passing the <HI>Dyfi,</HI> cross a bridge over the deep and still water of the <HI>Klywêdog,</HI> black as ink, passing sluggishly through a darksome chasm, into open day.</P>
<P>REACH <HI>Mallwyd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MALLWYD.</NOTE> remarkable for the situation of the altar, in the middle of the church; which Doctor <HI>Davies,</HI> author of the dictionary, then incumbent, in defiance of the orders of archbi∣shop <HI>Laud,</HI> removed again from its imaginary superstitious site at the east end.</P>
<P>ONE of the beautiful yew trees in the church-yard, is extremely well worth notice. It is a sort of forest of vast trees, issuing from one stem, forming a most extensive shade, and magnificent ap∣pearance. Another reason for planting these trees in church-yards, besides those usually assigned, was a custom in old times,
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
upon <HI>Palme Sunday,</HI> to make this the substitute of the tree, from which that <HI>Sunday</HI> took its name; to bless on that day the boughs; also to burn some of them to ashes; and with those the priest, on the following <HI>Ash-Wednesday,</HI> signed the people on the forehead, saying.
<Q>Memento, homo! quod pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris.</Q>
And of the branches, so blessed, it was customary to stick some in the fields, in rogation week, or at the times of processions.</P>
<P>RETURN to <HI>Dinas y Mowddwy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CRUEL MURDER.</NOTE> On the road was informed of the place, not far from hence, where <HI>Lewis Owen,</HI> vice-chamber∣lain of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and baron of the exchequer of <HI>North Wales,</HI> was cruelly murdered in the year 1555, by a set of banditti, with which this country was over-run. After the wars of the houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> multitudes of felons and outlaws inhabited this country; and established in these parts, for a great length of time, from those unhappy days, a race of profligates, who conti∣nued to rob, burn, and murder, in large bands, in defiance of the civil power; and would steal and drive whole herds of cattle, in mid-day, from one county to another, with the utmost impunity. To put a stop to their ravages, a commission was granted to <HI>John Wynn ap Meredydd,</HI> of <HI>Gwedyr,</HI> and this gentleman, in order to settle the peace of the country, and to punish all offenders against its government. In pursuance of their orders, they raised a body of stout men, and on a <HI>Christmas-Eve</HI> seized above four score out∣laws and felons, on whom they held a jail delivery, and punished them according to their deserts. Among them were the two sons of a woman, who very earnestly applied to <HI>Owen</HI> for the pardon
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
of one: he refused; when the mother, in a rage, told him (baring her neck) <HI>These yellow breasts have given suck to these, who shall wash their hands in your blood.</HI> Revenge was determined by the surviving villains. They watched their opportunity, when he was passing through these parts from <HI>Montgomeryshire</HI> assizes, to way-lay him, in the thick woods of <HI>Mowddwy,</HI> at a place now called, from the deed, <HI>Llydiart y Barwn;</HI> where they had cut down seve∣ral long trees, to cross the road, and impede the passage. They then discharged on him a shower of arrows; one of which stick∣ing in his face, he took out, and broke. After this, they attacked him with bills and javelins, and left him slain, with above thirty wounds. His son-in-law, <HI>John Llwyd,</HI> of <HI>Ceisgwyn,</HI> defended him to the last; but his cowardly attendants fled on the first onset. His death gave peace to the country; for most rigorous justice ensued; and the whole nest of banditti was extirpated, many by the hand of justice; and the rest fled, never to return.</P>
<P>THE traditions of the country respecting these banditti, are still extremely strong. I was told that they were so feared, that travellers did not dare to go the common road to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> but passed over the summits of the mountains, to avoid their haunts. The inhabitants placed scythes in the chimneys of their houses, to prevent the felons coming down to surprize them in the night; some of which are to be seen to this day. This race was distin∣guished by the titles <HI>Gwyllied y Dugoed,</HI> and <HI>Gwilliaid Cochion Mowddwy,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Banditti of the Black Wood,</HI> and <HI>The red-headed Banditti of Mowddwy.</HI></P>
<P>LEAVE <HI>Dinas,</HI> and take the road towards <HI>Dolgelleu.</HI> Pass by some deserted lead mines; which, as yet, have never been worked

with success. I may here mention an earth, which this place is noted for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OCHRE.</NOTE> a bluish ochre, which the shepherds wet, and pound in a mortar, then form into balls, and use in marking their sheep. An old proverb of the three things which <HI>Mowddwy</HI> wishes to send out of the country, shews their long knowlege of it.</P>

<P>ABOUT three miles from <HI>Dinas,</HI> leave on the left the vast sheep farm of <HI>Pennant-higi:</HI> a deep bottom, environed on three sides by vast mountains, forming a noble theatre. This whole country abounds in sheep and cattle; and the wool is manufactured in all parts into flannel and stockings.</P>
<P>ASCEND a steep hill, into the pass <HI>Bwlch Oer-ddyrws;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BWLCH OER-DDRWS.</NOTE> and the country beyond suddenly assumes a new face. Before us is a vast extent of dreary slope, bounded by vast rocky mountains; among which, <HI>Cader Idris</HI> soars pre-eminent.</P>
<P>THIS pass is noted for being one of the three places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONVENTION THERE.</NOTE> in which were assembled, six years after the wars of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> all the great men of certain districts, in order to enforce the observation of justice by their own weight, without any other legal sanction. This, perhaps, was occasioned by the merciless laws enacted against the <HI>Welsh</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. At each of these places, they en∣tered into a compact to cause justice to be done for all wrongs
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
inflicted, before and after the wars, but not during that turbulent period. Every one was to have his goods, or land, which had been forced from him, restored without law-suit; and any goods detained after this, were to be deemed as stolen: or if his lord sold them, he was fined ten pounds, and the goods, or their va∣lue, to the owner. If the refractory person was hanged, or died a natural death, the demand lay good against the wife, heirs, or executors: but if they or she denied the demand, the plaintiff must procure his compurgators, viz. six persons with him, to swear to the right of his clame; but (like the <HI>English,</HI> in cases of jury) the defendant had a right to challenge one of the six; and another was to be provided in his stead.</P>
<P>AFTER this, follow various regulations for restoring the go∣vernment of the country in general; and several laws relative to waifs and estrays, vagrants, bail, recovery of debts, manslaughter, thefts, duty of officers, &amp;c. The code concludes with valuation of several goods and chattels, for which satisfaction was to be made. For example, a horse and mare, on the oath of the owner and two neighbors, were valued at ten shillings; a foal at twenty pence; an ox at a mark; a cow at ten shillings; the hire of an ox, and the milk of a cow, were also valued; an ewe was esteemed at sixteen pence, her wool at four pence, her milk at two pence, and her lamb at eight pence.</P>
<P>As a proof of the high value of arms, and that we had few manufactures of that kind, a two-handed sword was valued at ten shillings, a one-handed at six shillings and eight pence, and a steel buckler at two shillings and eight pence: but, what is very
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
singular; a bow, which themselves could make, was valued at sixteen pence, and an arrow at six pence.</P>
<P>To all these laws, no penalty was annexed for the breach; ex∣cept the forfeiture of the benefit of the compact, which, in those unsettled times, was probably sufficient, as it left the party unsup∣ported and friendless.</P>
<P>DESCEND from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOLGELLEU.</NOTE> along very bad stoney roads, to <HI>Dol∣gelleu;</HI> every entrance to which is barred by a turnpike, in imi∣tation of other places; and every approach mended for a short space, by help of the scanty tolls. The town is small; the streets disposed in a most irregular manner; but the situation is in a beautiful vale, fertile, well wooded, and embellished with num∣bers of pretty seats, and watered by the river <HI>Onion;</HI> over which, on account of its floods, is a bridge of several arches. The town takes its name from its being placed in a dale abundant in hazels. It has nothing in it remarkable but the church, which, notwith∣standing it is pew-less, is a good building. Within is the monu∣ment of <HI>Meiric Vychan ap Ynyr Vychan,</HI> of the neighboring house of <HI>Nanney,</HI> fifth in descent from prince <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> son of <HI>Bleyddyn ap Cynvyn,</HI> who resided there, and in whose posterity it continues to this time; He is armed in a close mail helmet and neck-guard, sword in hand, and with a short mantle over the rest of his armour.</P>
<P><HI>Cader Idris</HI> rises immediately above the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CADER IDRIS.</NOTE> and is generally the object of the traveller's attention. I skirted the mountain for about two miles, left on the right the small lake of <HI>Llyn Gwernan,</HI> and began the ascent along a narrow steep horse-way, perhaps the highest road in <HI>Britain,</HI> being a common passage even for loaden
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
horses, into <HI>Llan-vibangel-y-Pennent,</HI> a vale on the other side. On gaining the brow of the hill, I found it to be a very extensive pasture of coarse grass, mixed with a little bog. The hill slopes from hence upwards: the steeper part to the highest peak, or the <HI>Pen yr Cader,</HI> grows more and more rocky: the approach to the summit extremely so, and covered with huge fragments of disco∣lored rocks, very rugged, and cemented by a semivitrified mat∣ter, which gives them a very vulcanic look, added to their dis∣joined, adventitious appearance. I met with, on my ascent, quantities of pumice, of the same cellular kind with the <HI>toadstone of Derbyshire,</HI> but of a green color. The day proved so wet and misty, that I lost the enjoyment of the great view from the summit. I could only see that the spot I was on was a rude ag∣gregate of strangely disordered masses. I could at intervals per∣ceive a stupendous precipice on one side, where the hill recedes inwards, forming a sort of theatre, with a lake at the bottom; yet very high, in comparison of the base of the mountain. On the other side, at a nearer distance, I saw <HI>Craig Cay,</HI> a great rock, with a lake beneath, lodged in a deep hollow; possibly the crater of an antient <HI>Vulcano.</HI> This is so excellently expressed by the ad∣mirable pencil of my kinsman, Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> that I shall not at∣tempt the description.</P>
<P>IN descending from the <HI>Cader;</HI> I kept on the edge of the greater precipice, till I came near the <HI>Cyfrwy,</HI> another peak. The whole space, for a considerable way, was covered with loose stones, in the form of a stream, sloping from the precipitous side. Multi∣tudes of them were columnar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLUMNS.</NOTE> but not jointed, square, or penta∣gonal; none erect, but lying very disorderly, in all directions.
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
Some appeared hanging down the face of the precipice; the ends of others were peeping out at a vast depth beneath me, which shewed the great thickness of the stream. I wish the day had been more favorable; but I hope another traveller will surround the whole, and make a more satisfactory relation of this moun∣tain, than I have been able to do.</P>
<P>IN respect to the heights of this mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HEIGHT.</NOTE> and those of <HI>Aran Benllyn,</HI> and the <HI>Arrenig Vawr,</HI> I am enabled to give a very exact account, by the assistance of the ingenious Mr. <HI>Meredith Hughes,</HI> of <HI>Bala;</HI> who assures me, that the <HI>Pen y Gader</HI> is nine hundred and fifty yards higher than the green near <HI>Dolgelleu; Aran Benllyn,</HI> seven hundred and forty above <HI>Llyn-tegid;</HI> and the <HI>Ar∣renig,</HI> only twenty yards short of the <HI>Aran;</HI> that the fall from the lake to <HI>Dolgelleu-Green,</HI> is one hundred and eighty yards; so that the real difference of height between the <HI>Cader</HI> and the <HI>Aran,</HI> is only thirty yards.</P>
<P>AFTER recovering the fatigue of this journey, I began another, in order to encircle the vast base of the mountain. I took the same road as I did before; and continued my ride beneath <HI>Tyrrau Mawr,</HI> one of the points of <HI>Cader Idris,</HI> the highest rock I ever rode under. Beyond, on the right, are the two pools called <HI>Llynian Cregenan;</HI> and not far distant, are some remains of circles of upright stones, with many carns; a vast stone, raised erect on the top of a neighboring rock; and several <HI>maeni hirion,</HI> or rude upright columns.</P>
<P>AT some distance beyond these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYS BRADWEN.</NOTE> near the river <HI>Kregennan,</HI> I saw the remains of <HI>Llys Bradwen,</HI> the court or palace of <HI>Ednowain,</HI> chief of one of the fifteen tribes of <HI>North Wales,</HI> either in the
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
reign of <HI>Gryffydd ap Cynan,</HI> or soon after. The reliques are about thirty yards square: the entrance about seven feet wide, with a large upright stone on each side, by way of door-case: the walls with large stones, uncemented by any mortar: in short, the structure of this palace shews the very low state of architecture in those times: it may be paralleled only by the artless fabrick of a cattle house.</P>
<P><HI>Ednyfed ap Aaren,</HI> a descendant of this great man, had the ho∣nor of entertaining <HI>Owen Glyndwr,</HI> in one of his sad reverses of fortune; and is said to have concealed him from the pursuit of his enemies, in the parish of <HI>Llan Gelynln,</HI> in a cave, to this day called <HI>Ogof Owain.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST not lead the reader into a belief, that every habitation, of these early times, were equal in magnificence to that of <HI>Ednowain ap Bradwen.</HI> Those of inferior gentry were formed of wattles, like <HI>Indian</HI> wigwams, or <HI>Highland</HI> hovels; without gar∣dens or orchard, and formed for removal from place to place, for the sake of new pasture, or a greater plenty of game. The fur∣niture was correspondent; there were neither tables, nor cloths, nor napkins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Girald. Cambr. Dejer. Walliae, <HI>888.</HI></NOTE>; but this is less wonderful, since we find, that even so late as the time of <HI>Edward</HI> II. straw was used in the royal apartment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anderson's Dict. Com,</HI> ii. 112.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT HOSPI∣TALITY.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this, the utmost hospitality was preserved: every house was open, even to the poorest person. When a stranger entered, his arms were taken from him, and layed by; and, after the scriptural custom, water was brought to
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
wash his feet. The fare was simple; the meal did not consist of an elegant variety, but of numbers of things put together in a large dish: the bread was thin oat-cakes, such as are common in our mountanous parts at this time. The family waited on the guests, and never touched any thing till they had done, when it took up with what was left. Music, and the free conversation of the young women, formed the amusements of the time; for jealousy was unknown among us. Bands of young men, who knew no profession but that of arms, often entered the houses, and were welcome guests; for they were considered as the volun∣tary defenders of the liberties of their country. They mixed with the female part of the family, joined their voices to the melody of the harp, and consumed the day with the most animated festi∣vity. At length, sunk into repose, not under rich testers, or on downy beds, but along the sides of the room, on a thin covering of dried reeds, placed round the great fire, which was placed in the centre, they lay down promiscuously, covered only by a coarse home-made cloth, called <HI>Brychan,</HI> or plaid, the same with the more antient <HI>Bracha;</HI> and kept one another warm, by lying close together; or should one side lose its genial heat, they turn about, and give the chilly side to the fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Giraldus, <HI>888.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME vein of the antient minstrelsie is still to be met with in these mountanous countries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT MIN∣STRELSIE.</NOTE> Numbers of persons, of both sexes, assemble, and sit around the harp, singing alternately <HI>pennylls,</HI> or stanzas of antient or modern poetry. The young people usually begin the night with dancing, and when they are tired, sit down,
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
and assume this species of relaxation. Oftentimes, like the mo∣dern <HI>Improvisitore</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> they will sing extempore verses. A person conversant in this art, will produce a <HI>pennyll</HI> apposite to the last which was sung: the subjects produce a great deal of mirth; for they are sometimes jocular, at others satyrical, and many amorous. They will continue singing without intermission, and never repeat the same stanza; for that would occasion the loss of the honor of being held first of the song. Like nightin∣gales, they support the contest throughout the night: <HI>Certant in∣ter se, palamque animosa contentio—victa morte finit saepe vitam, spiritu prius deficiente quam cantu,</HI> may almost be added. The au∣dience usually call for the tune: sometimes only a few can sing to it; and in many cases the whole company: but when a party of capital singers assemble, they rarely call for a tune; for it is indifferent to them, what tune the harper plays. Pa∣rishes often contend against parishes; and every hill is vocal with the chorus.</P>
<P>CONTINUE the ride, as before, between high mountains, in a narrow glen. Quit the narrow pass, and go along a good road, formed on the sides of the hills, with a fine slope from it to the sea, at this time strangely mottled with black and green, varied by the light through the broken clouds. The road now passes between verdant and smooth hills, the great sheep walks of the country; they are round at their tops, and covered with flocks, which yield the materials for the neighboring manufactures. From a place called <HI>Allt-Lwyd,</HI> have a very full view of the flat called <HI>Towyn Meirionydd,</HI> a mixture of meadow land and black turbery, watered by the <HI>Dysynni,</HI> which falls into the sea a few
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
miles lower. On one side is the village and church of <HI>Tywyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWYN.</NOTE> or <HI>Towyn.</HI> The rectory is an impropriation in the bishop of <HI>Lich∣field:</HI> the vicarage formerly belonged to the nunnery of <HI>Barking,</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> now in the patronage of the bishop of <HI>Bangor.</HI> I neg∣lected visiting this place; but believe my trouble would not have been thrown away; for I find, among Mr. <HI>Llwyd</HI>'s papers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> MSS.</NOTE>, the drawing of the sepulchral effigies of a churchman, another of a warrior, and two rude pillars, one seven feet high, with the figure of the cross, and an inscription on each side, in old characters. Another column, marked likewise with a cross, but inscribed with letters of a different form, is drawn in the same collection, from one in the church-yard of <HI>Llanvihangel y Traetheu,</HI> in this county.</P>
<P>FROM the place where I made this digression, I descended a sleep path through fields; and, crossing the river, dined on a great stone beneath the vast rock <HI>Craig y Deryn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CRAIG Y DERYN.</NOTE> or <HI>The Rock of Birds,</HI> so called from the numbers of corvorants, rock pigeons, and hawks, which breed on it. At the foot is a prodigious stream of stones, which extend some hundreds of yards from the bottom of the rock, and is formed by the continual lapse of fragments from it. Here the <HI>Towyn</HI> is contracted into a fertile vale, which extends about two miles further. Near its end is a long and high rock, narrow on the top. Here stood the castle of <HI>Teberri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TEBERRI CASTLE.</NOTE> which extended lengthways over the whole surface of the summit, and was a fortress of great strength and extent. The most complete apartment was thirty-six feet broad, and was cut out of the rock on two sides; for much of it is hollowed. In some parts, the
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
precipices, skirted by a wall, formed the defence. The remain∣ing walls are well built: the stones squared: the mortar, shells, and gravel, but at present very rotten. The whole of this place is so overgrown with bushes, as to render the survey very diffi∣cult. It lies in the parish of <HI>Llan vi hangel y Pennant,</HI> and is said to have been once defended by a <HI>Coch o'r Pennant,</HI> or <HI>The Red,</HI> of that place.</P>
<P>THIS probably was the castle <HI>Bere</HI> belonging to our last <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> which was taken, not long before the final conquest of <HI>Wales,</HI> by <HI>William de Valence,</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland's Collect.</HI> i. 178.</NOTE>. This seems to have been likewise the same which was committed by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to the custody of <HI>Robert Fitzwalter,</HI> who had, at the same time, the liberty of hunting all kinds of wild beasts in this county<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rotulae Walliae,</HI> 99.</NOTE>. It is fit to mention this, as there was another strong fortress in <HI>Cardiganshire,</HI> of a similar name.</P>
<P>RETURN about half a mile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAL Y LLYN.</NOTE> and ride several miles along the pretty vale of <HI>Tal y Llyn;</HI> very narrow, but consisting of fine mea∣dows, bounded by lofty verdant mountains, very steeply sloped. Went by <HI>Llyn y Myngil,</HI> a beautiful lake, about a mile long, which so far fills the valley, as to leave only a narrow road on one side. Its termination is very picturesque; for it contracts gradually into the form of a river, and rushes through a good stone arch into a narrow pass, having on one side the church, on the other a few cottages, mixed with trees. The church, and that of <HI>Llanvehan∣gel y Pennant,</HI> are chapels to <HI>Towyn</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ecton,</HI> 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101"/>ADJACENT to this valley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR COFFIN.</NOTE> at a place called <HI>Llwyn Dôol Ithel,</HI> in the year 1684, was found, in digging turf about three yards deep, a coffin, made of deal, about seven feet long, carved and gilt at both ends. Two skeletons, supposed of different sexes, were found in it, placed with the head of the one parallel to the feet of the other; the bones were moist; and tough, and of an uncom∣mon size, the thigh bones being twenty-seven inches long. Within a yard of the coffin, were found two other skeletons, of the same dimensions with the former, layed on the bare clay; and within two roods of them, a grave, with a skeleton of the usual size. Along the graves and coffin were layed hazel rods, with the bark on, and so tough, as to be flexible<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Llwyd's Itin.</HI> MS. Another instance is related in <HI>Cambden,</HI> ii. 793.</NOTE>. The high preservation of these rods, and the toughness of the bones, were owing to the bituminous quality of the turbery in which they were deposited. The rods were placed for some superstitious purpose, perhaps to avert the power of witchcraft, since a double hazel-nut, in some parts of the Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is to this day supposed to have that virtue.</P>
<P>A FEW miles beyond <HI>Tal y Llyn</HI> church, the hills almost meet at their bottoms, and change their aspect. No verdure now is to be seen, but a general appearance of rude and savage nature. The sides are broken into a thousand crags; some spiring and sharp pointed; but the greater part project forward, and impend in such a manner, as to render the apprehension of their fall tre∣mendous. A few bushes grow among them; but the dusky color
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
of them, as well as the rocks, only served to add horror to the scene.</P>
<P>ONE of the precipices is called <HI>Pen y Delyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLAM Y LLA∣DRON.</NOTE> from some resem∣blance it has to a harp. Another is styled <HI>Llam y Lladron,</HI> or <HI>The Thieves Leap,</HI> from a tradition that thieves were brought there, and thrown down. I have no doubt but that such a punishment might have been inflicted from this <HI>Welsh Tarpeian,</HI> by order of an arbitrary lord; but we formerly very rarely used capital punish∣ments, for any crime; not but the gallows was in use for theft<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leges Walliae,</HI> 221.</NOTE>, but fines were accepted in almost all instances, even in cases of murder; which gave rise to private revenge, and brought on a train of endless feuds and bloodshed.</P>
<P>ON the left, is the rugged height of <HI>Cader Idris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN Y TRI GRAIENYN.</NOTE> pass near a small lake, called <HI>Llyn y tri Graienyn,</HI> or of the three <HI>grains;</HI> which are three vast rocks, the ruins of the neighboring mountain, which some time or other had fallen into the water. These, say the peasants, were the three grains which had fallen into the shoe of the great <HI>Idris,</HI> which he threw out here, as soon as he felt them hurting his foot.</P>
<P>PASS over <HI>Bwlch Coch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NANNEY.</NOTE> and, after descending a very bad road, again reach <HI>Dolgelleu;</HI> from whence I visited <HI>Nanney,</HI> the antient seat of the antient family of the <HI>Nanneys,</HI> now of the <HI>Vaughans.</HI> The way to it is a continual ascent of two miles; so perhaps it is the highest situation of any gentleman's house in <HI>Britain.</HI> The estate is covered with fine timber, which clothe all the sides of the dingles for many miles. On the road side is a venerable oak, in its last stage
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
of decay, and pierced by age into the form of a gothic arch; yet its present girth is twenty-seven feet and a half. The name is very classical, <HI>Derwen Ceubren yr Ellyll,</HI> the hollow oak, the haunt of <HI>daemons.</HI> How often has not warm fancy seen the fairy tribe revel round its trunk! or may not the visionary eye have seen the <HI>Hamadryad</HI> burst from the bark of its coeval tree?</P>
<P>ABOVE <HI>Nanney</HI> is a high rock, with the top incircled with a dike of loose stones. This had been a <HI>British</HI> post, the station, perhaps, of some tyrant, it being called <HI>Moel Orthrwm,</HI> or the hill of oppression.</P>
<P>THE park of <HI>Nanney</HI> is remarkable for its very small, but very excellent venison. I have before mentioned the ruins of the house of <HI>Howel Sele,</HI> within this park, and related his unfortunate history<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tour in <HI>Wales,</HI> i. 324.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RETURN through <HI>Dolgelleu;</HI> and about a mile beyond, on a rising spot, have a beautiful view of three vales, finely bounded by hills, and embellished with gentlemen's houses; finely watered by the junction of the <HI>Onion</HI> and the <HI>Maw,</HI> or <HI>Mowdach.</HI> I was diverted from taking the direct road to <HI>Barmouth,</HI> by the great deference I always found reason to pay to the judgement of a gentleman, who, a few years ago, honored our country with his remarks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A Gentleman's Tour through <HI>Monmouthshire</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> in 1774, printed for <HI>T. Evans,</HI> 1775.</NOTE>, and has made a particular euloge on the cascades of <HI>Glyn-Maw.</HI> Let me add, that the consideration of ending this little excursion at the hospitable house of Mr. <HI>Garnons,</HI> of <HI>Rhiw Goch</HI> was another spur to my design.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104"/>CROSS the bridge of <HI>Llan Elltyd.</HI> Below is a fine tract of mea∣dow, wretchedly deformed by the necessity of digging into them for turf, the fuel of the country. The tide flows within a small distance of this place; and on the banks I saw a small sloop, ready to be launched. On the left is the church of <HI>Llan-Elltyd:</HI> on the right, in a rich flat, stand the remains of the abbey of <HI>Cymmer.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CYMMER ABBEY.</NOTE> Part of the church is still to be seen, and shews its an∣tient grandeur. At the east end are three lofty, but very narrow windows, pointed at top; and over them three lesser, mantled in a great and gloomy thicket of ivy. The great hall, and part of the abbot's lodgings, now form a farm-house.</P>
<P>THIS had been an abbey of <HI>Cistercians,</HI> founded (not by <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth,</HI> as has been supposed, who only confirmed the dona∣tions, as prince of <HI>Wales</HI>) but by the two princes <HI>Meredydd</HI> and <HI>Gryffydd,</HI> the sons of <HI>Conan</HI> and <HI>Howel,</HI> the son of <HI>Gryffydd,</HI> about the year 1198. In the charter of <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> in 1209, is mention of their benefactions, of his own, and of the boundaries of the abbey lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> MSS.</NOTE>; which shew it had been founded by other persons. This charter is most ample, over rivers, lakes, and sea; birds, and wild beasts and tame; over all mountains, woods, things moveable and immoveable; and over all things under and over the lands so granted; and gives liberty of digging for metals and hidden treasures: all which was done in presence of <HI>Esau,</HI> then <HI>lord</HI> abbot, and others, religious of the house <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Monast.</HI> i. 826; who, as well as <HI>Tanner,</HI> confounds this with <HI>Cwmbir</HI> abbey, in <HI>South Wales.</HI></NOTE>. At the dissolution, its re∣venues
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
were valued at fifty-one pounds thirteen shillings and six pence, by <HI>Dugdale,</HI> at fifty-eight pounds fifteen shillings and four pence, by <HI>Speed.</HI> The only charge on it in 1553, was six pounds thirteen shillings and four pence, paid to <HI>Lewis ap Thomas,</HI> sup∣posed to have been the last abbot<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis,</HI> ii. 313.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Uchtred ap Edwyn</HI> built a castle here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> which was taken and overthrown, about 1116, by <HI>Eneon ap Cadwgan,</HI> and <HI>Gryffyd ap Meredydd ap Bleyddyn</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 183.</NOTE>; and its place is not at present even known.</P>
<P>CONTINUE my journey on a bank high above the <HI>Maw.</HI> The valley grows soon very contracted; the sides of the hills finely covered with wood, almost to the top; and the river assumes the form of a torrent, rolling over a rocky channel.</P>
<P>ABOUT five or six miles from <HI>Dolgelleu,</HI> at <HI>Dôol y Melynllyn,</HI> I turned out of the road, meeting the furious course of the <HI>Gamlan,</HI> that falls, with short interruptions, from rock to rock, for a very considerable space, amidst the woods and bushes, till it reaches a lofty precipice, from whence it precipitates into a black pool, shaded by trees (which gives to the cataract the name of <HI>Rhaia∣der-ddu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RHAIADER DDU</NOTE> or <HI>The Black.</HI>) A noble birch, placed above, finely finishes this picturesque scene.</P>
<P>CROSS <HI>Pont ar Gamlan,</HI> below which the river falls into the <HI>Maw.</HI> Not far from thence, the junction of the <HI>Maw</HI> and <HI>Eden</HI> forms another fine scene. A lofty hill, cloathed with woods, ends here, and forms the forks of the rivers, correspondent to the steeps
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
through which these torrents roll, and exhibits a view like those of the shady wilds of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>BEGIN a considerable ascent, and find on the top some groves of handsome oaks: before me, a naked country. Descend, through some steep fields, to another set of wooded dingles, that wind along the bottoms, and join with the former. In various parts, <HI>Cader Idris</HI> appears in full majesty over these sloping forests, and gives a magnificent finishing to the prospect. Soon after my ar∣rival among the woods, another cascade astonishes me with its grandeur. From the situation I was in, it formed a vast fall, bounded on one side by broken ledges of rocks, on the other by a lofty precipice, with trees here and there growing out of its mural front. On the summit of each part, oaks and birch form distinct little groves, and give it a sort of character distinct from our other cataracts. After the water reaches the bottom of the deep concavity, it rushes in a narrow rocky chasm, of a very great depth, over which is an admirable wooden <HI>Alpine</HI> bridge; and the whole, for a considerable way, awefully canopied by trees. This is called <HI>Pistill y Kain,</HI> or the spout of the river <HI>Kain.</HI> At no great distance from it, is another (for nature is here profuse in her beauties of this kind).<NOTE PLACE="marg">PISTILL Y MAW.</NOTE> The <HI>Maw,</HI> for some space, runs along a deep glen, finished by a bare mountain, seen through vistos, formed by the woods on each side. The water tumbles down a series of ledges, of different heights, into a very black and sullen pool, from which it re-assumes its violence, and is lost among the far extending woods.</P>
<P>IN the nakedness of winter, there is a spot, far above, from whence these two cataracts may be seen at once, exhibiting through
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
the trees a piece of scenery, as uncommon as it is grand. After emerging from these romantic depths, I reach a long extent of woodless tract, the vast parish of <HI>Trawsfynnydd,</HI> walled in on all sides by lofty rugged mountains, of various forms.</P>
<P>IN a farm-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEDH PORUS.</NOTE> not far from this road to <HI>Rhiw Goch,</HI> I visited <HI>Bedh Porus,</HI> or the grave of <HI>Porus.</HI> On a flat stone over it, is the following inscription, copied somewhat differently by Mr. <HI>Llwyd,</HI> in the <HI>Britannia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">II. 791.</NOTE>:
<Q><L>PORVS</L>
<L>HIO IN TVMVLO IACIT,</L>
<L>HOMO PIANVS FVIT.</L></Q></P>
<P>SOME have supposed the P to have been an R, and the word to have been CHRISTIANUS FUIT; but, whatsoever the let∣ter in dispute might have been, there certainly never was room between HOMO and the next word, for the letters CHRIS.</P>
<P>NOT far from it, in another field, is a great upright stone, called <HI>Llech Idris.</HI> There is some silly legend about it, concern∣ing the giant <HI>Idris;</HI> but it is no more than one of the monu∣mental columns, so frequent in <HI>Wales,</HI> and many other parts.</P>
<P>AFTER a short ride,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SARN HELEN.</NOTE> see on a common, for the first time, the noted <HI>Sarn,</HI> or <HI>Llwybr Helen,</HI> the causeway or path of <HI>Helen;</HI> a road supposed to have been made through part of <HI>North Wales,</HI> by <HI>Helena,</HI> daughter of <HI>Eudda,</HI> or Octavius, and wife to the em∣peror <HI>Maximus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rowland,</HI> 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS road is now entirely covered with turf; but, by the rising of it, is in most parts very visible: beneath are the stones which
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
form it, and extend in all its course, to the breadth of eight yards. There are tumuli near it, in various places, it being very usual for the <HI>Romans</HI> to inter near their highways. Close to the part in question is one, in which were found five urns: the whole ma∣terials of it are composed of burnt earth and stones, with several fragments of bricks, which had been placed round the urns, to keep them from being crushed.</P>
<P>AFTER reposing a night at <HI>Rhiw Goch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL PRYSOR.</NOTE> adjacent to this part of the journey, I continued it a few miles to <HI>Castell Prysor,</HI> a very singular little fort, placed in a pass between the hills, on a natural round rock, appearing, at first sight, like the artificial mounts we had before observed. Around its summit had been the wall, whose remains are visible in several places; and in one is the ap∣pearance of a round tower: the facings are very regular, but the work destitute of mortar. Notwithstanding this, the castelet is probably <HI>Roman;</HI> for multitudes of coins and urns are found about it. The name explains the cause of the want of lime in the walls, <HI>Castell Prysor</HI> signifying a castle <HI>made in baste,</HI> so that there was not time to prepare the usual cement. Around its base are the foundations of several buildings, which were placed there to enjoy the protection of the place.</P>
<P>FROM hence I took the track towards <HI>Festiniog,</HI> and saw, by the road side, <HI>Llyn Rathllyn,</HI> a small lake, noted for a strange variety of perch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CROOKED PERCH.</NOTE> with a hunched back, and the lower part of the back-bone, near the tail, oddly distorted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Br. Zool,</HI> iii. tab. xlviii.</NOTE>: in other respects, they re∣semble the common kind, which are equally numerous in this water. The same are found at <HI>Fablun,</HI> in <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="109"/>NOT far from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN CAMP.</NOTE> within the inclosed country, I found a very fine <HI>Roman</HI> camp, most judiciously placed, in a situation over an extensive view of the country, partly level, partly inclin∣ing from it, and commanding a number of passes to die lesser posts of this mountanous tract. It is surrounded with a ditch and bank, on the last of which are the vestiges of a wall: near one end is a great mount of earth, broken and hollow in the middle, from the removal of the stones which composed the fort: round its base is a deep ditch. This camp is called <HI>Tomnen y Mur,</HI> or the mount within the wall. Coins and urns are as frequent about this place as the former. <HI>Sarn Helen</HI> runs into it at one end, and is continued to <HI>Rhyd yr Halen,</HI> in <HI>Festiniog</HI> parish, and by the side of <HI>Fannod Vawr,</HI> and over a farm called <HI>Cae Du,</HI> to <HI>Ffrydd y Dduallt,</HI> to the upper part of a farm called <HI>Croesor,</HI> at the upper end of <HI>Cwm Croesor,</HI> and through <HI>Cae Ddafydd,</HI> in <HI>Nanmor,</HI> and perhaps to <HI>Dinas Emrys.</HI> The branches are numerous: I cannot entertain a doubt but that one pointed, by <HI>Castell Dol Wyddelan,</HI> to <HI>Caer Hûn,</HI> or <HI>Conovium;</HI> and that by <HI>Pont Aber Glas Llyn,</HI> and <HI>y Gymwynas,</HI> or the work <HI>done in kindness,</HI> may be supposed to have been another, pointing to <HI>Segontium.</HI> I have before men∣tioned a <HI>Ffordd Helen,</HI> among the <HI>Berwyn</HI> hills; and let me add those recorded by the annotator on <HI>Cambden,</HI> in <HI>Llanbadarn Odyn,</HI> in <HI>Caerdiganshire;</HI> and from <HI>Brecknock</HI> to <HI>Neath,</HI> in <HI>Glamorganshire;</HI> which pass under the name of the same princess<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> ii, 790.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CLOSE by the road side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OVAL INCLOSURE.</NOTE> on the common, at a small distance from the camp, is an oval inclosure, about thirty-six yards long,
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
and twenty-seven wide in the middle, surrounded by a high mound of earth, but without a foss. There were two entrances, one op∣posite to the other; and near one end, a part seemed to have been divided off by a wall, whose foundations still remain.</P>
<P>I RETURNED out of the parish of <HI>Trawsfynnydd,</HI> along the beautiful road of the preceding day, till I reached <HI>Llan Elltyd,</HI> when I kept on the side of the hill, above the valley which leads to <HI>Barmouth.</HI> The ride is very picturesque; the vale wa∣tered by the <HI>Maw</HI> (known here only by the name of <HI>Avon,</HI> or <HI>The River</HI>) which widens as we advanced: the sides bounded by hills, chequered with woods. I found the little town of <HI>Barmouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BARMOUTH</NOTE> seated near the bottom of some high mountains, and the houses placed on the steep sides, one above another, in such a manner as to give the upper an opportunity of seeing down the chimneys of their next subjacent neighbors. The town is seated very near to the sea, at the mouth of the <HI>Maw,</HI> or <HI>Mawddoch;</HI> and takes its name of <HI>Barmouth, i. e. Aber Maw,</HI> or <HI>Mawddoch,</HI> from that circumstance. At high water, the tide forms here a bay, about a mile over, but the entrance hazardous, on account of the many sand-banks. This is the port of <HI>Meirio∣niddshire,</HI> but not so much frequented as it ought to be, by reason the inhabitants do not attempt commerce on a large scale, but vend their manufactures through the means of factors, who run away with much of the advantages which the natives might en∣joy; yet ships now and then come to fetch the webs, or flan∣nels; and I am informed, that a few years ago, forty thousand pounds worth have been exported in a year, and ten thousand
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
pounds worth of stockings. Many of the webs are sold into <HI>Spain,</HI> and from thence sent to <HI>South America.</HI></P>
<P>IN a former visit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>July</HI> 18th, 1770.</NOTE> to this place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">FASTING WOMAN.</NOTE> my curiosity was excited to examine into the truth of a surprizing relation of a woman in the parish of <HI>Cylynin,</HI> who had fasted a most supernatural length of time. I took boat, had a most pleasant passage up the harbour, charmed with the beauty of the shores, intermixed with woods, verdant pastures, and corn fields. I landed, and, after a short walk, found, in a farm called <HI>Tydden Bach,</HI> the object of my excursion, <HI>Mary Thomas,</HI> who was boarded here, and kept with great humanity and neatness. She was of the age of forty-seven, of a good countenance, very pale, thin, but not so much emaciated as might be expected, from the strangeness of the circumstances I am going to relate; her eyes weak, her voice low, deprived of the use of her lower extremi∣ties, and quite bed-ridden; her pulse rather strong, her intel∣lects clear and sensible.</P>
<P>ON examining her, she informed me, that at the age of seven, she had some eruptions like the measles, which grew confluent and universal; and she became so fore, that she could not bear the left touch: she received some ease by the appli∣cation of a sheep's skin, just taken from the animal. After this, she was seized, at spring and fall, with swellings and in∣flammations, during which time she was confined to her bed; but in the intervals could walk about; and once went to <HI>Holywell,</HI> in hopes of cure.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="112"/>WHEN she was about twenty-seven years of age, she was at∣tacked with the same complaint, but in a more violent man∣ner; and during two years and a half, remained insensible, and took no manner of nourishment, notwithstanding her friends forced open her mouth with a spoon, to get something down; but the moment the spoon was taken away, her teeth met, and closed with vast snapping and violence: during that time, she flung up vast quantities of blood.</P>
<P>SHE well remembers the return of her senses, and her know∣lege of every body about her. She thought she had slept but a night, and asked her mother whether she had given her any thing the day before, for she found herself very hungry. Meat was brought to her; but so far from being able to take any thing solid, she could scarcely swallow a spoonful of thin whey. From this, she continued seven years and a half without any food or liquid, excepting sufficient of the latter to moisten her lips. At the end of this period, she again fancied herself hungry, and desired an egg; of which she got down the quan∣tity of a nut kernel. About this time, she requested to receive the sacrament; which she did, by having a crum of bread steeped in the wine. After this, she takes for her daily sub∣sistence a bit of bread, weighing about two penny-weights seven grains, and drinks a wine glass of water: sometimes a spoonful of wine, but frequently abstains whole days from food and liquids. She sleeps very indifferently: the ordinary func∣tions of nature are very small, and very seldom performed. Her attendant told me, that her disposition of mind was mild; her temper even; that she was very religious, and very servent
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
in prayer: the natural effect of the state of her body, long un∣embarrassed with the grossness of food, and a constant aliena∣tion of thought from all worldly affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She was living in 1780, and in the same state.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS instance of the influence of disease (for such only can it be called) strange as it is, is not without parallel.</P>
<P>THE first is the case of a lady, a patient of the late doctor <HI>Gower,</HI> of <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> who was confined to her bed for ten years, during which time she had an extreme and constant aversion to all kinds of solid nourishment. She drank a pint of tea daily; and once in three or four days chewed, without swallowing, a few raisins of the sun and blanched almonds, about four or half a dozen of each: she seldom eat oftener than once a month, and then only a bit of dry bread, of the size of a nutmeg; but frequently abstained from food for many weeks together. This lady recovered, by means of constant medical regimen; so that she could walk two miles, without taking ei∣ther rest or refreshment.</P>
<P>I REFER the reader to the <HI>Tour</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> of 1769, for the extraordinary case of <HI>Katherine Macleod,</HI> of the county of <HI>Ross;</HI> and finally, shall mention that of <HI>Martha Taylor,</HI> of —, near <HI>Bakewell, Derbyshire,</HI> who abstained from food from <HI>De∣cember</HI> 22, 1669, for thirteen months, and took nothing the whole time, excepting a few drops of syrup, water and sugar or the juice of roasted raisins. She was also very religious; was much emaciated; her palms moist; her other evacuations very small<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> Miscel. iv. 41. 55.

<P><PB N="108" REF="114"/>I SHALL now mention another singular personage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EVANS THE CONJURER.</NOTE> but less innocent, a native of the same parish with <HI>Mary Thomas.</HI> This was the noted astrologer, and ill-favored knave, <HI>Arise Evans,</HI> a character and species of impostor frequent in the reigns of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>James</HI> I. His figure is preserved in the <HI>Antiqua∣rian Repertory,</HI> and answers the description given of him by his great pupil, <HI>William Lilly,</HI> of having a broad forehead, beetle∣brows, thick shoulders, flat nose, full lips, a down look, black curling stiff hair, and splay foot. He was a deep student in the <HI>black art;</HI> and <HI>Lilly</HI> assures us, that he had most <HI>piercing judgement naturally upon a figure of theft,</HI> and many other questions, he ever met withal; was well versed in the <HI>nature of spirits;</HI> and had many times used the <HI>circular way of invocating.</HI> He then tells how his friend <HI>Evans,</HI> by means of the angel <HI>Salmon,</HI> brought to him a deed, which one of his customers had been wronged of, at the same time blowing down part of the house of the person in whose custody it was: and again, how, to satisfy the curiosity of lord <HI>Bothwel</HI> and Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby,</HI> who wanted to see a spirit, he liked to have lost his life, being carried over the <HI>Thames,</HI> and flung down near <HI>Battersea,</HI> by the spirits, whom he had vexed at the time of invocation, for want of <HI>making</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the life of <HI>Benevuto Cellini,</HI> is a most ridiculous tale of this nature.</NOTE> <HI>a due fumigation.</HI> These ridiculous impostures were the fashionable credulity of the times; and the greatest men were the dupes of these pretenders to occult science. To shew that <HI>Wales</HI> was fertile in geniuses of every kind, we must lay clame to the celebrated doctor <HI>John Dee,</HI> or <HI>Dû,</HI> who.

was born at <HI>Nant-y-Groes, Radnorshire</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>J. D. Rhys Cambr. Brit.</HI> Ling. Institut. p. 60.</NOTE>, and was sought after by the greatest princes in <HI>Europe. Ben.

<P>ON my return to <HI>Barmouth,</HI> I proceeded for some time along the coast, among shifting sands. Pass near <HI>Kail Wart,</HI> by a stone, now serving as a foot bridge, on which was this inscrip∣tion: <HI>Hic jacet</HI> CALIXTUS <HI>Monedo Regi.</HI> There is no tradition of the place it was removed from.</P>
<P>ASCEND from the coast to <HI>Cors-y-gedol,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CORS-Y-GEDOL.</NOTE> the antient seat of the <HI>Vaughans,</HI> where I was entertained by <HI>William Vaughan,</HI> esquire, for some days, in the style of an antient baron. The woods near his house are extensive, but affected by the west winds in a very surprizing manner: the tops are shorn quite even, and the boughs so interwoven, as to form seemingly a close and al∣most impenetrable surface.</P>
<P>THERE are few places which abound more in <HI>British</HI> anti∣quities, than the environs of <HI>Cors-y-Gedol.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CRAIG Y DINAS.</NOTE> I first visited <HI>Craig y Dinas,</HI> the summit of a hill, surrounded with a vast heap of stones, the ruins of a wall, which, in many parts, retain a re∣gular and even facing: this, and some others similar, are the first deviations from the rude ramparts of stone, and prior to the improvement of masonry by the use of mortar. Into this
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
is an oblique entrance, with stone facings on both sides; and near it are two ramparts of stones. The whole is on the steep extremity of the hill, near to which is a pass into the country.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile farther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN BODLYN.</NOTE> is <HI>Llyn Bodlyn,</HI> a small lake, beneath a lofty precipice, well stocked with char, which will take a bair, and afford good diversion to the angler. <HI>Llyn Cwm Howel</HI> is another lake in this neighborhood, noted for a race of trouts (which I have seen) with most deformed heads, thick, flatted, and toad shaped; and which, probably, might give rise to the fabled accounts of the monstrous species recorded by <HI>Giraldus.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER passing by <HI>Llyn-Irddin,</HI> a small piece of water, on a plain, arrive amidst a wondrous group of <HI>Druidical</HI> antiquities. On the flat appear two circles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CIRCLES OF STONES.</NOTE> The first is about fifty-six feet in diameter, formed of piles of loose stones, with upright co∣lumns, placed at five yards distance from each other, in pairs, so as nearly to divide the circle into four parts. About thirty yards from this, is a lesser, with several upright stones among the smaller, but placed with less regularity. Design, not chance, certainly directed the founders of these circles in the disposition of the columnar stones; but I fear, when I come to speak more fully of them, the cause must remain unaccounted for, by reason of the remoteness of the time, and the mystery of the antient priesthood.</P>
<P>HALF a mile fouth of these, on the side of a hill, are two car∣nedds, of a most stupendous size, containing an uncommon as∣semblage of druidical customs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CARNEDDEU HENGWM.</NOTE> or religion, in form of <HI>Cromleh, Maen Hir,</HI> and <HI>Kist Vaen.</HI> Both are of an oblong form, and
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
composed of loose stones: the largest is fifty-five feet, long, and twelve high, in the middle. At the east end is a great <HI>Crom∣leh</HI> altar, composed of two sloping stones, one placed over the edge of the other, upon five flat upright stones, seven feet high in one part, and four feet ten in the lowest. About eight yards from this, is the upper stone of a <HI>Cromleh,</HI> lying flat on the carnedd, without the appearance of any other support.</P>
<P>ELEVEN yards farther, is another great heap of stones, and in it a large <HI>Cromleh,</HI> supported with upright stones. It is now converted into a retreat for a shepherd, who has placed stone seats within, and formed a chimney through the loose stones above. In the same carnedd, a little farther on, is another magnificent <HI>Cromleh,</HI> whose incumbent stone is twelve feet by nine; four vast columns, or <HI>maen hirion,</HI> three now fallen, and a third erect. The columns are from the height of ten feet four, to that of twelve feet eight; and each between four and five feet broad.</P>
<P>NORTH-WEST of these antiquities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL DINAS CORTIN.</NOTE> on the top of a hill, is a strong post, called <HI>Castell Dinas Cortin,</HI> entrenched around, with an advanced work on one side. This, and <HI>Castell Craig y Dinas,</HI> were doubtlessly formed as defences to the sacred ground, the subject of the above description. I may add like∣wife another object of protection, of the same nature, which I met with on my return to <HI>Corsegedol,</HI> two great <HI>Carnedds,</HI> placed on small eminences, near to each other; and within one, the five square flags of a <HI>Kist vaen,</HI> the top being de∣stroyed.

it, <HI>The Hill of the Horns of</HI> JOVE. It more probably was a place of sacrifice before or after the chace, and derived its title from the horned deity <HI>Cernunnos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CERNUNNOS.</NOTE> who was venerated by the <HI>Gauls,</HI> and applied to as a protector from the dangers attendant on the diversion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Religion de <HI>Gaulois,</HI> ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 85.</NOTE> Both the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Britons</HI> had one com∣mon religion; so that <HI>Cernunnos</HI> might as reasonably be supposed to have a place here as in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THIS neighborhood also abounds with <HI>Cromlechs</HI> of very great size.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CROMLECHS.</NOTE> I measured one, in a tenement called <HI>Bryn-y-Voel,</HI> which was sixteen feet four inches long, seven feet four broad, and twenty inches thick. It lay about two feet above the ground, supported by small stones, and was surrounded with a circle of loose stones. Most of the <HI>Cromlechs</HI> of these parts lie very near to the ground, and in that respect differ from those of other places. They lie likewife horizontally, which shews that their object was different, whatsoever it was.</P>
<P>THIS country is in the hundred of <HI>Ardudwy.</HI> The entrance into it from <HI>Trawsfynnydd</HI> is called <HI>Drws Ardudwy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DEWS ARDUDWY.</NOTE> or the door of <HI>Ardudwy,</HI> formed by nature through the sterile mountains, which separate the places. I was tempted to visit this noted pass, and found the horror of it far exceeding the most gloomy idea that could be conceived of it. The sides seemed to have been rent by some mighty convulsion into a thousand precipices, forming at their tops rows of shelves, which the peasants, com∣paring to the ranges in a dove cot, style <HI>Carreg y Klommenod,</HI> or the rock of the pigeons. The bottom of this passage is covered
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
with a deluge of stones, which have streamed from the sides; and along it is a narrow horse-path, on the slippery rock, formed by the removal of a few of the fragments, which, in other places, are disposed into form of most steep and hazardous flights of steps: and yet, as if the natural and artificial difficulties of these ways were not sufficient to terrify invaders, there are, in one place, the vestiges of a wall, which went across the pass, in which might have been the door which gave name to it.</P>
<P>ON my return, I visited an ordinary house, called <HI>Maes y Gar∣nedd,</HI> the birth place of the regicide colonel <HI>Jones;</HI> whose inso∣lence to the neighboring gentry is still spoken of, even to this day, with much warmth. Actuated by enthusiasm, he went every length that the congenial <HI>Cromwell</HI> dictated; and was a brave and successful officer in a cause, which, after a certain pe∣riod, was the result of ambition, and the foundation of tyranny.</P>
<P>FROM some of the adjacent heights of this ride, I had a full view beneath me (it being low water) of the long range of sand and gravel, which runs from this coast twenty-two miles into the sea. It is deservedly called <HI>Sarn Badrig,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SARN BADRIG.</NOTE> or, more properly, <HI>Bad-rhwyg,</HI> or <HI>Ship breaking Causeway,</HI> from the number of ships lost upon it. This shoal is dry at the ebb of spring-tides, and marked in storms by horrible breakers. Tradition says, that all this part of the sea had been a habitable hundred, called <HI>Cantréer Gwaelod,</HI> or <HI>The Lowland Hundred;</HI> and that it was overwhelmed by the sea, about the year 500, in the time of <HI>Gwyddno Go∣ronhir.</HI></P>
<P>A SIMILAR accident happened, in some distant period, on the coast of <HI>Essex.</HI> The canons of <HI>St. Paul</HI> must be possessed of a
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
prebend, before they can become residentiaries; and the one usually given is, <HI>The Praebenda consumpta per mare,</HI> which lay on the coast of that county.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Corsegedol,</HI> I pursued my journey towards <HI>Harlech;</HI> but, on the road, was tempted, by my constant fellow-traveller, the reverend Mr. <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> to make a small deviation to the right, to visit a near relation of his, who lived a few miles to our right, in his antient territories of <HI>Cwm Bychan.</HI> We approached it through <HI>Glyn Artro,</HI> a little valley, watered by a river of the same name, and prettily wooded. The view upwards was extremely pictu∣resque, of a conic rock, skirted by a sweet grove; and beyond soared the naked mountains, which bounded the object of our ride.</P>
<P>AFTER passing through the wood, and ascending <HI>Dinas Porch∣ellyn,</HI> had before us a wild horizon of rocks and rocky moun∣tains. Even these tracts, unfriendly as they seem to vegetation, had once been covered with venerable oaks; and there still re∣mained a few, between eight and nine feet in circumference. We went under their shade, above a rapid torrent, with a de∣lightful view before us of a true <HI>Alpine</HI> wooden bridge, and a small mill; and, a little farther, an antient arch, flung from rock to rock, giving passage over a still and black water, shaded by trees. Ford the river again near <HI>Llyn Sarph,</HI> or <HI>The Serpent's Hole.</HI> Wind up a rocky stair-case road, and arrive full in sight of <HI>Cwm Bychan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM BYCHAN.</NOTE> embosomed with rocks of magnificent height. After a short ride, high above a lake of the same name, descend, and reach the house of the venerable <HI>Evan Llwyd,</HI> who, with his ancestors, boast. of being lords of these rocks, at left since the

year 1100. This, and the fortified pass of <HI>Drws Ardudwy,</HI> were most probably occupied by the sons of <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> in their contests with the sons of <HI>Uchtryd ap Edwyn,</HI> whom they at last expelled the country.</P>
<P>The following, as it is the true descent of Mr. <HI>Evan Llwyd,</HI> and my fellow-traveller, who, being brother's children, are eighteenth in descent from <HI>Blyddyn ap Cynvyn,</HI> so it is a genuine copy of the form of a <HI>British</HI> pedegree:</P>
<P><HI>Evan ap Edward, ap Richard, ap Edward, ap Humphrey, ap Edward, ap Dafydd, ap Robert, ap Howel, ap Dafydd, ap Meirig Llwyd o Nannau, ap Meirig Vychan, ap Ynyr Vychan, ap Ynyr, ap Meuric, ap Madog, ap Cadwgan, ap Bleddyn, ap Cynvyn,</HI> prince of <HI>North Wales</HI> and <HI>Powys</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numbers of respectable families in this country, are of the same descent.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I WAS introduced to the worthy representative of this long line, who gave me the most hospitable reception, and in the style of an antient <HI>Briton.</HI> He welcomed us with ale and po∣tent beer, to wash down the <HI>Coch yr Wden,</HI> or hung goat, and the cheese, compounded of the milk of cow and sheep. He likewise shewed us the antient family cup, made of a bull's scro∣tum, in which large libations had been made in days of yore. The family lay in their whole store of winter provisions, being inaccessible a great part of the season, by reason of snow. Here they have lived for many generations, without bettering or lessen∣ing their income; without noisy fame, but without any of its embittering attendants.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="122"/>OF this house was the valiant <HI>Dai Llwyd,</HI> to whom is said to have been addressed the noted <HI>Welsh</HI> tune, <HI>Ffarwel</HI> DAI Llwyd, on occasion of his going with <HI>Jasper Tudor</HI> and <HI>Owen Lawgoch,</HI> to fight <HI>Risiart Frawdwr,</HI> or <HI>Richard the Traitor,</HI> by which name the <HI>Welsh</HI> stigmatized <HI>Richard</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>THE mansion is a true specimen of an antient seat of a gen∣tleman of <HI>Wales.</HI> The furniture rude: the most remarkable were the <HI>Cistie Styffylog,</HI> or the great oatmeal chests, which held the essential part of the provision.</P>
<P>THE territories dependent on the mansion, extend about four miles each way, and consist of a small tract of meadow, a pretty lake swarming with trout, a little wood, and very much rock; but the whole forms a most august scenery. The naked moun∣tains envelope his vale and lake, like an immense theatre. The meadows are divided by a small stream, and are bounded on one side by the lake; on the other, by his woods, which skirt the foot of the rocks, and through which the river runs, and beyond them tumbles from the heights, in a series of cataracts. He keeps his whole territory in his own hands; but distributes his hinds among the <HI>Havadwys,</HI> or summer dairy-houses, for the conveniency of attending his herds and flocks: he has fixed his heir on another part of his estates. His ambition once led him to attempt draining his lake, in order to extend his landed pro∣perty; but, alas! he gained only a few acres of rushes and reeds; so wisely bounded his desires, and saved a beautiful piece of water. He found on one side a stratum of fine white earth, about half a yard thick, which I knew was what mineralogists dignify with the name of <HI>Lac Lunae,</HI> and <HI>Agaricus Mineralis.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
The <HI>Germans</HI> use it as an absorbent in dysenteries and malignant fevers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Da Costa</HI>'s Fossils, i. 83.</NOTE>; and it would prove a good manure.</P>
<P>STOOLS and roots of firs, of vast size, are frequently found near the lake. Mr. <HI>Llwyd</HI> found one, with the marks of fire on it, which he used to repair the <HI>Tyddyn y Traian,</HI> or jointure-house of his family; an ancient customary appendage to most of the <HI>Welsh</HI> houses of any note.</P>
<P>AMONG the mountains which guard the <HI>Cwm,</HI> is one named <HI>Carreg y Saeth,</HI> on whose verge is a great <HI>Maen Hîr,</HI> and <HI>Car∣nedd. Saeth</HI> signifies an arrow; so probably the antient sports∣men here took their stand, to watch the passing of the deer, which formerly abounded in these parts. Nor have they long been extinct; a person of the last generation informed my host, that he had seen eighteen at once, grazing in the meadow.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Welsh</HI> had several animals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT HUNTING.</NOTE> which were the objects of the chace; such as, <HI>y Carw,</HI> or the stag; <HI>Kaid Wenyn,</HI> a swarm of bees; and <HI>y Gleisiad,</HI> or the salmon. <HI>Yr Arth,</HI> the bear; <HI>y Dringhedydd,</HI> climbing animals, I suppose wild cats, martins, and squirrels; and <HI>Ceiliog Coed,</HI> or cock of the wood. And the last division was, <HI>y Llwynog,</HI> the fox; <HI>Ysgyfarnog,</HI> the hare; and <HI>yr Ywrch,</HI> the roe. Some of the above come very improperly under our idea of hunting, yet were comprehended in the code of laws relative to the diversion, formed, as is supposed, by <HI>Gryffyd ap Cynan</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lewis's Hist, Wales,</HI> Introd. 56.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I SUSPECT also, that the otter was an object of diversion; there
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
being a <HI>Cylch Dyfrgwm,</HI> or an annual payment, by the <HI>Welsh,</HI> for the prince's water dogs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Record of <HI>Caernarvon, Harl.</HI> MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE three first were <HI>Helfa Gyffredyn,</HI> or the common hunt. The stag, because he was the noblest animal of chace; and be∣cause every body, who came by at his death, before he was skinned, might clame a share in him. The next animals were, <HI>Helfa Gyfarthfa,</HI> or the animals which could be brought to bay, such as the bear, &amp;c. which were hunted with hounds till they ascended a tree. The bird mentioned here, is the cock of the wood, whose nature it is to sit perched on a bough, where they will gaze till they are shot, as they were, in old times, by the bow, or cross-bow.</P>
<P>THE third division was <HI>Helfa Ddolef,</HI> or the shouting chace, because attended by the clamor of the sportsmen; and compre∣hended the fox, the hare, and the roe. The method of hunting was either with hounds, or grehounds, which they let slip at the animals, holding the dogs in leashes. No one was to slip his grehound when the hounds were in chace, unless he had a hound in the pack, on penalty of having the grehound ham-strung: neither was it allowed to kill any animal of chace on its form, or at rest, on pain of forfeiting his bow and arrow to the lord of the manor. When several grehounds, the property of different persons, were slipt at any animal, the person whose dog was nearest the beast, when last in sight, clamed the skin. A bitch was excepted, unless it was proved she was pregnant by a dog which had before won a skin.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125"/>EVERY person who carries a horn, must give a scientifical ac∣count of the nine objects of chace, or else he will be looked on as a pretender, and forfeit his horn. The same penalty at∣tends the <HI>Cynllafan,</HI> or leash; he is never again to wear it round his middle, on pain of forfeiture; but then he is suffered to wear it round his arm.</P>
<P>THE antient <HI>Welsh</HI> held the flesh of the stag, hare, wild boar, and the bear, to be the greatest delicacies among the beasts of chace.</P>
<P>THE prince had his <HI>Pencynwydd,</HI> or chief huntsman. He was the tenth officer of the court. He had for his own supper one dish of meat; and after it, three horns of mead, one from the king, another from the queen, the third from the steward of the houshold. He was never to swear, but by his horn and his leash. He had the third of the fines and heriots of all the other huntsmen; and likewise the same share of the <HI>amobr,</HI> on the marriage of any of their daughters. At a certain time of the year, he was to hunt for the king only: at other seasons, he was permitted to hunt for himself. His horn was that of an ox, of a pound value. He had in winter an ox's hide, to make leashes; in summer, a cow's, to cut into spatterdashes.</P>
<P>THE king had liberty of hunting wheresoever he pleased; but if a beast was hunted and killed on any gentleman's estate, and not followed and clamed by the huntsman that night, the owner of the land might convert it to his own use, but was to take good care of the dogs, and preserve the skin.</P>
<P>THE penalty of killing a tame stag of the king's, was a pound; and a certain fine, if it was a wild one, if it was killed between
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
a certain day in <HI>November</HI> and the feast of <HI>St. John,</HI> the va∣lue was sixty pence; but the fine for killing it, a hundred and eighty pence. A stag was also reckoned equivalent to an ox; a hind to a well grown cow; a roe to a goat; a wild sow to a tame sow; a badger had no value, because in some years it was measled; wolves and foxes, and other noxious animals, had no value, because every body was allowed to kill them; and there was none set upon a hare, for a very singular reason, because it was believed every other month to change its sex<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Leges Wallicae,</HI> xxxix. 256 to 260.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Cwm Bychan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HARLECH.</NOTE> took the road to <HI>Harlech,</HI> a small and very poor town, remarkable only for its castle, which is seated on a lofty rock, facing the <HI>Irish</HI> sea, above an extensive marsh, once occupied by the water. This fortress was antiently called <HI>Twr Bronwen,</HI> from <HI>Bronwen</HI> or <HI>The White-necked,</HI> sister to <HI>Bran ap Llŷr,</HI> king of <HI>Britain.</HI> In after-times, it got the name of <HI>Caer Collwyn,</HI> from <HI>Collwyn ap Tango,</HI> one of the fifteen tribes o <HI>North Wales,</HI> and lord of <HI>Efionydd, Ardudwy,</HI> and part of <HI>Llŷn.</HI> His grand∣children flourished in the reign of <HI>Gryffydd ap Cynan.</HI> He resided some time in a square tower in the antient fortress, whose remains are very apparent; as are part of the old walls, which the more modern, in certain places are seen to rest on.</P>
<P>THE present castle was the work of <HI>Edward</HI> I. is a noble square building, with a round tower at each corner, and one on each side the entrance, with elegant turrets issuing out of the great rounders, like those of his other castles of <HI>Caernarvon</HI> and <HI>Conway.</HI> It was completed before the year 1283: at lest, I then

find, that a hundred pounds was the annual salary of <HI>Hugh de Wlonkeslow,</HI> the constable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ayloff's Welsh Calendar, <HI>92.</HI></NOTE>; but it was afterwards reduced; for it appears, that the annual fee was only twenty-six pounds thir∣teen shillings and four pence, and in some accounts fifty pounds, which was supposed to be for both constable and captain of the town. The whole garrison, at the same time, was twenty sol∣diers, whose annual pay amounted to a hundred and forty pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dodderidge, <HI>58.</HI></NOTE>. The present constable is <HI>Evan Lloyd Vaughan,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> with a salary of fifty pounds a year, payable out of the revenues of <HI>North Wales.</HI> It was impregnable on the side next to the sea: on the other, it was protected by a prodigious foss, cut with vast expence and trouble in the hard rock.</P>
<P>THIS place was possessed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BESIEGED IN 1468</NOTE> in 1468, by <HI>Dafydd ap Jevan ap Ei∣nion,</HI> a strong friend of the house of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and distinguished as much by his valour, as his goodly personage, and great sta∣ture<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gwedir Family, <HI>77.</HI></NOTE>. He was besieged here by <HI>William Herbert,</HI> earl of <HI>Pem∣broke,</HI> after a march through the heart of our <HI>Alps,</HI> attended with incredible difficulties; for in some parts, the soldiers were obliged to climb; in others, to precipitate themselves down the rocks<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> ii, The road is to this day called <HI>Lle Herbert.</HI></NOTE>; and at length invested a place, till that time deemed impregnable. <HI>Pembroke</HI> committed the care of the siege to his brother, Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> a hero equal in size and prowess to the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> commandant. Sir <HI>Richard</HI> sent a summons of surrender; but <HI>Dafydd</HI> stoutly answered, that he had kept a castle in <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
so long, that he made all the old women in <HI>Wales</HI> talk of him; and that he would keep this so long, that all the old women in <HI>France</HI> should talk of him. Famine probably subdued him: he yielded on honorable terms, and <HI>Richard</HI> engaged to save his life, by interceding with his cruel master, <HI>Edward</HI> IV. The king at first refused his request; when <HI>Herbert</HI> told him plainly, that his highness might take his life, instead of that of the <HI>Welch</HI> captain; or that he would assuredly replace <HI>Dafydd</HI> in the castle, and the king might send whom he pleased to take him out again.

<HI>Edward</HI> I. formed the town into a borough, and conferred on it grants of certain lands, and other emoluments.</P>
<P>NEAR this place was found the celebrated piece of antiquity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In possession of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn.</HI></NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TORQUES.</NOTE> on which the learned have thought sit to bestow the name of <HI>Torques.</HI> It is well described in <HI>Cambden,</HI> as a wreathed rod of gold, about four feet long, with three spiral furrows, with sharp intervening ridges running its whole length to the ends, which are plain truncated, and turn back like pot-hooks. Whether this was purely <HI>Roman,</HI> or whether it might not have been com∣mon to both nations, I will not dispute. The use was that of a baldric, to suspend gracefully the quiver of men of rank, which hung behind by means of the hook, and the golden wreath crossed the breast, and passed over the shoulder. <HI>Virgil,</HI> in his beautiful description of the exercises of the <HI>Trojan</HI> youth, expresses the manner in these frequently misconstrued lines:

<P>THE <HI>Torch,</HI> or <HI>Torques,</HI> worn by the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Britons,</HI> was a very different affair, a collar of gold, or other metal, worn round the neck. Our heroine <HI>Boadicia</HI> had a great one of that precious

<P>THE custom of wearing the <HI>Torques</HI> was continued from the more remote periods of <HI>Britain,</HI> to later times. <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> a a lord of <HI>Yale,</HI> was called <HI>Llewelyn aur Dorchog, Llewelyn</HI> with the golden torques, on that account; and the common proverb, <HI>Mi a dynna'r dorch a chwi,</HI> I will pluck the torques with you,

<P>FROM <HI>Harlech</HI> I ascended a very steep hill, and on my way observe several <HI>maen hirion,</HI> and circles formed of large common pebble-stones, and of different diameters; sometimes appears circle within circle; in other places, they intersect each other.

<P>THE <HI>tumulus</HI> is called that of king <HI>Ingo:</HI> but since the three monarchs of that name were said to have been steady christians, and to have lived in the eleventh century, I do guess both tu∣mulus

The narrow path we rode on, impends over it, and is cut out of a hill, whose sides are composed of shivering slate, starting out at an immense height above, threatening destruction: they were much enlivened by flocks of milk-white goats, which skiped along the points, and looked down on us with much un∣concern.</P>
<P>FROM one of the heights, a vast <HI>Alpine</HI> prospect appears in view. The stupendous mountains of <HI>Caernarvenshire,</HI> and those
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
of <HI>Merioneddshire,</HI> not much inferior, form a tremendous scenery, and rise divided into a multitude of craggy heads. The last are particularly barren, and appear quite naked, excepting where varied by a mossy verdure, or whitened by the <HI>lichen tartaricus.</HI> The highest summit of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> called <HI>y Wyddfa,</HI> soars pre-emi∣nent. From thence, the mountains gradually lower, to <HI>Lleyn,</HI> which stretches in view far to the west, and terminates on the point of <HI>Aberdaron.</HI> Descend into a deep glen, cloathed on each side with trees, with the <HI>Velyn-Rhyd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VELYN RHYD.</NOTE> or <HI>Yellow Ford,</HI> at bottom; notwithstanding its name, a most inky stream; the fine cataract a little above, being most fitly styled <HI>Rhaiader-Du,</HI> or <HI>The Black.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER a short ride, reach the village and chapel of <HI>Maen Twrog,</HI> dependent on the church of <HI>Festiniog,</HI> Near one end is a great upright stone, from which it takes the name. This stone is taken into the <HI>Welsh</HI> calendar, canonized by the name of <HI>St. Twrog.</HI> The place lies in the <HI>Tempe</HI> of this country, the vale of <HI>Tan y Bwlch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TAN Y BWLCH.</NOTE> a narrow, but beautiful tract, about three or four miles long, divided by the small river <HI>Dwy'ryd,</HI> or <HI>The Two Fords,</HI> being formed by the <HI>Cynsael</HI> and another stream, which unite towards the upper ends. The vale is composed of rich meadows; the sides edged with groves; and barren preci∣pitous mountains close this gem, as it were, in a rugged case. Here is a very neat small inn, for the reception of travellers, who ought to think themselves much indebted to a nobleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present earl of <HI>Radnor.</HI></NOTE>, for the great improvement it received from his munificence.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="135"/>ABOVE it is a house, embosomed with woods, most charmingly situated on the side of the hill. This seat, from the quick suc∣cession of owners by the fatal attachment to the bottle, has oc∣casioned many a moral reflection from the <HI>English</HI> traveller. <Q>A heavy glutinous ale has charms enough to debauch the senses of the whole principality;</Q> and, let me add, after a certain stage, the fiery dram is called in, to effect the destruction the former had begun; yet I trust that its charms do not fasci∣nate the senses of the WHOLE principality; but that, after a fair scrutiny, there may be found some corner free from the <HI>Baccha∣nalian</HI> rout.</P>
<P>THE river hereabouts widens into a good salmon fishery; and, after some space, falls into an arm of the sea, called <HI>Traeth Bach,</HI> or the little sands.</P>
<P>RIDE up the vale, and dismounting, meet the course of the <HI>Cynfael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FALLS OF THE CYNFAEL.</NOTE> which tumbles along the bottom of a deep time-worn chasm, sided with sharp and rugged rocks for a very considerable space, darkened by trees that overspread the whole, issuing both from the sides and margin. Near <HI>Festiniog</HI> is one cascade, re∣markably fine, consisting of three great falls, the lowest dropping into a deep pool, black, and over-shadowed by far impending rocks. Below, is a magnificent columnar rock, rising out of the torrent, and called <HI>Pulpit Hugh Llwyd Cynfael. Hugh</HI> lived in the time of <HI>James</HI> I. was supposed to have been a magician, and from thence to have delivered his nocturnal incantations; a place, fit indeed for the purpose as the pit of <HI>Acheron.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT a mile from the <HI>Cynfael,</HI> is another comfortable inn, which has often received me, after my toilsome expeditions.
<PB N="129" REF="136"/>
Opposite to it lies <HI>Cwm Cwm̄orthin;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM̄ORTHIN.</NOTE> a retreat much more seques∣tered, and much more difficult of access, than even <HI>Cwm-bychan.</HI> In my visit to it, I descended through woods, along a steep road, into a very deep, but narrow valley, which I crossed, and began a very hazardous and fatiguing ascent up the rocky front of a losty mountain: the path narrow and dangerous, and, I be∣lieve, very rarely attempted by horses. After the labor of a mile, reached this strange habitation of two farmers, in a hollow surrounded on three parts by the rudest of environs, and con∣taining a pretty lake, and two tenements, which yield only grass; so that, in case the inhabitants have any other wants, they must descend from their <HI>Cwm</HI> to get them supplied. The mountains which inclose it, are the <HI>Moel-wyn yr Hydd,</HI> and the <HI>Moel-wyn Gwyn,</HI> and others equally rude. High in the first is the lake <HI>Du-bach,</HI> which affords perch; and another, called <HI>Llyn Trwstyl∣lon;</HI> and opposite to the last, a third, called <HI>Llyn Conglog;</HI> all of which, after hard rains, form noble cataracts down the fronts of the hills. We preferred another way out of this singular place, and wound up a narrow path at the farthest end, on part of <HI>Molwyn y Hydd,</HI> in order to descend through <HI>Cwm Croesor;</HI> being then desirous of getting by the nearest road to <HI>Pont Aber Glâs Llyn.</HI> But in our descent we met with such narrowness of path, such short turnings, and horrible precipices, that our poor beasts, with much reason, trembled in every limb; and, in fact, had a wonderful escape in getting safe to the bottom. The traveller who chuses to follow our steps, will find a narrow grassy bottom in <HI>Cwm Croesor,</HI> with a few tenements: he will pass through a
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
pretty wood, and soon after find himself on the high road from <HI>Tan y Bwlch</HI> to <HI>Caernarvon.</HI></P>
<P>IN this journey, I went from <HI>Festiniog</HI> on a less hazardous way. Not two miles from thence, on the road from <HI>Trawsfyn∣nydd</HI> to <HI>Yspytty,</HI> I fell again into <HI>Fford Helen,</HI> which is here quite bare, and exhibits the rude stones with which it was made.</P>
<P>NEAR it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEDDAU GWYR ARDUDWY.</NOTE> at <HI>Rhyd yr Halen,</HI> on the right, are the remains of <HI>Beddau Gwyr Ardudwy,</HI> or the graves of the men of <HI>Ardudwy.</HI> These graves were about six feet long, marked at each end by two upright stones; but most of the stones are now removed. There are yet to be seen several circles of stones, the largest about fifty-two feet in diameter; a vast carnedd, with two up∣right stones placed on one part, as if to mark the entrance to the cell, which it probably incloses; and near it a lesser heap, and a small circle; all of which had been surrounded with a larger circle, now incomplete by the application of the materials to the making of walls. The tradition relating to these monuments, is classical; nearly parallel with the rape of the <HI>Sabines.</HI> The men of <HI>Ardudwy,</HI> to populate their country, made an inroad into the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> and layed violent hands on the fair ladies of the land: they carried them in safety to this place, where they were overtaken by the warriors of the vale: a fierce battle ensued, and the men of <HI>Ardudwy</HI> all slain; but the ravishers had some how or other so gained the hearts of their fair prey, that, on their defeat, the ladies, rather than return home, rushed into an adja∣cent water, called, from the event, <HI>Llyn y Morwynion,</HI> or <HI>The Maiden's Lake,</HI> and there perished. That this had been the
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
scene of a bloody conflict, there is a probability: the graves and carnedds prove it; and the circles evince, that it was in the time when the ceremonies of druidism existed.</P>
<P>FROM hence I descended the long and tedious steep of <HI>Bwlch Carreg y Frân,</HI> into the narrow vale of <HI>Penmachno;</HI> and, after ascending another hill, turn to the right into the black and moory mountains, to visit <HI>Llyn Conwy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN CONWY.</NOTE> the source of the noted river of that name. It is a very large piece of water, most dismally si∣tuated among rock and bog, and the sides very irregularly in∣dented. It is placed the highest of any large piece of water I have met with in these parts. In it are three islands, one of which is the haunt of the black-back Gulls, during the breeding season. They are so exceedingly fierce in the defence of their young, that I knew of a man who was nearly drowned, in an at∣tempt to swim to their nests, being so violently beaten by the old birds, that he thought he escaped well, with the dreadful bruises he received on all the upper part of his body. The water issues out of the end of the lake, in form of a little rill; but in the course of a few miles, before it reaches <HI>Llanrwst,</HI> becomes a most: considerable river, by the addition of the various mountain streams.</P>
<P>DESCEND for two or three miles, and reach the village of <HI>Yspytty Jevan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">YSPYTTY.</NOTE> or the hospital of <HI>St. John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> so styled from its having formed, in the then inhospitable country, an asylum and guard for travellers, under the protection of the knights who held the manor, and made its precincts a sanctuary. After the abolition of the order, this privelege became the bane of the neighborhood; for the place, thus exempted from
<PB N="132" REF="139"/>
all jurisdiction, was converted into a den of thieves and mur∣derers, who ravaged the country far and wide with impunity, till the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. when they were extirpated by the bravery and prudence of <HI>Meredydd ap Evan.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER a very long interval, another charity succeeded, in the alms-houses for six poor men, founded in 1600, by captain <HI>Richard Vaughan,</HI> a poor knight of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and descended from the neighboring house of <HI>Pant Glâs.</HI></P>
<P>IN the church are three alabaster figures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMBS.</NOTE> The first is the va∣liant <HI>Rhys Vawr ap Meredydd,</HI> of the house of <HI>Plâs Yolyn;</HI> to whom, at the battle of <HI>Bosworth, Henry</HI> VII. entrusted the stan∣dard of <HI>England,</HI> after the bearer, Sir <HI>William Brandon,</HI> was slain by <HI>Richard:</HI> a proper respect to the <HI>Welsh,</HI> who so highly fa∣vored the <HI>Lancastrian</HI> cause. The next is an ecclesiastic, his son, <HI>Robert ap Rhys,</HI> cross-bearer and chaplain to cardinal <HI>Wolsey:</HI> and the third <HI>Lowry,</HI> the wife of the great Rhys. I may add, that he left several sons, from whom were descended many familes, particularly those of <HI>Rhiwlas, Pant Glâs, Giler,</HI> and <HI>Voelas.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Yspytty</HI> I made an excursion to <HI>Voelâs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VOELAS.</NOTE> about two miles distant, remarkable for a great column, with an inscription in memory of <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who was slain in the year 1021. Here is likewise a vast artificial mount, the site of a <HI>Welsh</HI> castelet, destroyed by <HI>Llewelyn</HI> the Great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Poem addressed to him by <HI>Llywarch Brydydd y Moch,</HI> in <HI>Evans</HI>'s Coll. <HI>Awdl.</HI> vii.</NOTE>. Mr. <HI>Llwyd</HI> confesses the inscription to be very obscure. It is part in

<HI>Latin,</HI> part in <HI>Welsh.</HI> The last line says, <HI>Levelinus optimus prin∣ceps hic humatus;</HI> which, if meant of any of the actual princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> must intend <HI>Llewelyn ap Sitsyllt;</HI> he being the only one of the three of the name of <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> of whose place of interment we are ignorant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> ii. 816.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TURN back, and again reach the river <HI>Conway.</HI> Enter CAERNARVONSHIRE, And, after a short ride,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RHAIADER Y GRAIG LLWYD.</NOTE> arrive at its celebrated falls, not very far from its junction with the <HI>Machno.</HI> The prospect is very ex∣traordinary, from the neighborhood of a fulling mill, where the channel of the rivers form a triangle of deep and doleful chasms, worn by the water through the live rock. Not far below, be∣gins the cataract, the most tremendous I ever saw, and whose roaring gives sufficient notice of its vicinity. The rocks which bound it are of a vast height, and approach very near to each other, and want the pleasing <HI>accompaniment</HI> of trees, attendant on most of our cascades. One fall is of very great height; and be∣neath that, full in view, is a succession of four lesser. The de∣scent is steep and dangerous, and not to be attempted but by those who have strength of body, and steadiness of head. When down, I found myself environed with naked precipices, faced with angular columnar rocks, pointing in a sloping direction towards the river, adding to the strangeness of the scenery.</P>
<P>DESCEND a steep hill, and arrive in <HI>Nant Conwy,</HI> or the vale of <HI>Conwy,</HI> after passing over <HI>Pont-or-Lleder;</HI> beneath which, the
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
river <HI>Lleder</HI> hastens to join thar which gives name to the valley, Observe, in the course of the <HI>Conwy,</HI> a deep, wide, and still wa∣ter, called <HI>Llyn yr Afange,</HI> or <HI>The Beavers Pool,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BEAVERS.</NOTE> from being, in old times, the haunt of those animals. Our ancestors also called them, with great propriety, <HI>Llost-Lydan,</HI> or the broad tailed ani∣mal. Their skin was in such esteem, as to be valued at a hun∣dred and twenty pence; while that of the martin took no more than twenty-four pence; an ermine, twelve; an otter, wolf, or fox, only twelve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leges Wallicae,</HI> 260. 261.</NOTE>. They seem to have been the chief finery and luxury of the days of <HI>Hoel Dda.</HI></P>
<P>THE vale gradually expands from this end, and extends about twenty miles, terminating at the town of <HI>Conway.</HI> It soon widens to about a mile in breadth, and improves in beauty, especially in the neighborhood of <HI>Llanrwst,</HI> where it is divided into the most beautiful meadows. The sides of the hills finely cultivated: on the western, the vast mountains of <HI>Snowdon</HI> rise in a majestic range. The eastern consists of low and broken hills, chequered with rich pasturage, corn fields, and groves. The river mean∣ders through the whole, and before it reaches <HI>Llanrwst,</HI> is of a considerable size.</P>
<P>VISIT the church of <HI>Bettws Wyrion Iddon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BETTWS WYRION.</NOTE> or the bead-house of the gran-children of <HI>Iddon.</HI> Within is the figure of <HI>Gruffydd ap Dafydd Goch,</HI> son to <HI>Dafydd Goch,</HI> natural son of <HI>Dafydd,</HI> bro∣ther to the last prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> He is in armour, recumbent, with this inscription: <HI>Hic jacet Grufud ap Davyd Goch, agnus</HI> DEI <HI>misere mei.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="135" REF="143"/>A LITTLE farther, pass by <HI>Pont y Pair,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PONT Y PAIR.</NOTE> a most singular bridge, flung over the <HI>Llugwy,</HI> consisting of five arches, placed on the rude rocks, which form most durable piers. These rocks are precipitous, and in high floods exhibit to the passenger most awful cataracts below the bridge. The scenery beyond, of rocky mountains, fringed wich woods, is very striking.</P>
<P>THIS bridge was built on the following occasion: One <HI>Howel,</HI> a mason from <HI>Penllyn,</HI> having occasion, about the year 1468, to attend the <HI>Merionethshire</HI> assizes, then held at <HI>Conway,</HI> had his passage over the <HI>Lleder</HI> obstructed by floods. This determined him to remove to the spot, where he built a bridge, at his own expence, and received no other gratuity than what resulted from the spontaneous generosity of passengers. He afterwards moved to the <HI>Llugwy,</HI> and began that of <HI>Pont y Pair,</HI> but died before he completed his work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Llwyd's Itin.</HI> MS. i. The same authority says, that near this place is a great Cromleh, called <HI>Cromleh Hwva,</HI> so named from one <HI>Hwva ap Kyfnerth,</HI> at <HI>Rhyddon,</HI> who concealed himself under it, when the earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> deso∣lated these parts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I SOON left the bridge, and, after a steep ascent, arrive at <HI>Dolwyddelan</HI> castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOLWYDDELAN CASTLE,</NOTE> seated in a rocky valley, sprinkled over with stunted trees, and watered by the <HI>Lleder.</HI> The boundaries are rude and barren mountains; and, among others, the great bending mountain <HI>Scabod,</HI> often conspicuous from most distant places.</P>
<P>The castle is placed on a high rock, precipitous on one side, and insulated: it consists of two square towers; one forty feet by twenty-five; the other thirty-one by twenty. Each had for∣merly
<PB N="136" REF="144"/>
three floors. The materials of this fortress are the shat∣tery stone of the country; yet well squared, the masonry good, and the mortar hard. The castle-yard lay between the towers.</P>
<P>THIS had been founded by some of our princes; but we are ignorant of its origin. There were very few castles in <HI>North Wales,</HI> before its conquest by the <HI>English.</HI> They were needless; for Nature created in our rocks and mountains, fortifications (un∣till our fatal divisions) quite impregnable. Had there been oc∣casion for artificial retreats, the wealth of our country could rea∣dily have supplied the means of erecting them. We had the ba∣lance of trade in our favor. This prevented our princes from ever making use of their third prerogative, that of coining<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tertiam est, jus leges condendi, et MONETAM PERCUTIENDI. <HI>Wottou's Leges Wallicae,</HI> 71.</NOTE>. Our herds and flocks were the frequent resource of the <HI>English,</HI> and brought large sums into <HI>Wales.</HI> Witness the large sums of money we too frequently were obliged to pay, as purchasers of disgraceful peace. Besides, cash was far from being requisite, since, by our laws, every subject was bound to assist in building the royal castles, excepting the husbandmen belonging to the king<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leges Wallicae, <HI>165.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Jorwerth Drwndwn</HI> made this place his residence; and here is said to have been born his son, <HI>Llewelyn the Great</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gweair Fam. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE>, who began his reign in the time of <HI>Richard</HI> I. If <HI>Dolinchalan</HI> castle is, as I

suppose, the same with this, <HI>Gryffydd ap Tudor,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. had a fee of fifteen pounds as constable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rotulae Walliae, <HI>97.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Meredydd ap Jevan,</HI> an ancestor of the <HI>Wynnes,</HI> of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. purchased the lease of this castle, and the inclosures belonging to it, from the executors of Sir <HI>Ralph Berkenet;</HI> it having been excepted among the places granted by <HI>Richard</HI> III. and resumed by his successor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gwedir Family,</HI> 137; a publication we are indebted for, to my respected friend, the honorable DAINES BARRINGTON.</NOTE>. Before that time, <HI>Hoel as Evan ap Rhys Gethin,</HI> a noted outlaw, resided here. As soon as it came into possession of <HI>Meredydd,</HI> he removed his habi∣tation in <HI>Evionedd,</HI> a hundred in the county, to this castle; giv∣ing this excellent reason: <Q>I had rather fight with outlaws and thieves, than with my own blood and kindred: if I live in my own house in <HI>Evionedd,</HI> I must either kill mine own kinsmen, or be killed by them!</Q> The feuds among the gentry in <HI>Evionedd,</HI> occasioned perpetual murders; and <HI>Nant-Conwy</HI> was filled with <HI>banditti.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gentleman soon reformed the country: he established colonies of the <HI>most tall and able men</HI> he could procure; till at last they amounted to seven score tall bowmen, every one arrayed in a <Q>jacket or armolet coate, a good steele cap, a short sword and dagger, together with his bow and arrowes; many of them alsoe had horses and chasing slaves, which were ready to answer the crie on all occasions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="146"/>HE founded the strong house of <HI>Penamnaen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PENAMNAEN.</NOTE> a mile distant from the castle. He removed the church, which before lay in a thicket, to a more open place, by way of security; for he never dared to quit his house, without leaving in it a strong guard; and another of twenty tall archers to attend him, whenever he went to church; besides a watchman, on a rock called <HI>Carreg y Big,</HI> to give notice of the approach of the <HI>banditti.</HI> He ended his useful life in 1525, and left behind him twenty-three legiti∣mate, and three natural children.</P>
<P>THE church had been an impropriation of the abby of <HI>Bedd∣kelert;</HI> is very small; and has in it a monument, commemorating such of the family who were buried here<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pedegree of the <HI>Wynnes,</HI> See Appendix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN my return to <HI>Pont y Pair,</HI> digressed a little up the river <HI>Llugwy,</HI> to see a noted cascade, called <HI>Rhaiader y Wenol,</HI> or <HI>The Water-fall of the Swallow.</HI> The river runs along a strait stony channel, for a considerable way, amidst narrow meadows, bounded by majestic <HI>Alpine scenery;</HI> then falls into an amazing hollow. The bottom is difficult of access; but when arrived at, exhibits a wonderful scene of mountain and precipice, shaded with trees, which fringe the top, and start even from the fissures of the sides.</P>
<P>CROSS <HI>Pont y Pair,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CARREG Y GWALCH.</NOTE> and go beneath a very lofty rock, cloathed with wood, called <HI>Carreg y Gwalch,</HI> or <HI>The Rock of the Faleon.</HI> Here was the retreat of a famous partizan of the house of <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI> called, <HI>Dafydd ap Shenkin,</HI> who lurked in a cave, still named, from him, <HI>Ogo Davyd ap Shenkin.</HI> The noblest oaks in
<PB N="139" REF="147"/>
all <HI>Wales</HI> grew on this rock, within memory of man. I remem∣ber the stools of several, which proved that they were equal to any which grow in the deepest soil; yet these rocks are totally destitute of all earth for a considerable way, so that the nutri∣ment which the oaks received, must have been derived from the deep penetration of the roots, through the fissures of the stones, into some nutritive matter.</P>
<P>THE antient house of <HI>Gwedir</HI> stands near the foot of this rock.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GWEDIR.</NOTE> It is built round a greater and lesser court. Over the gate-way is the date, 1558, with I. W. <HI>John Wynne ap Meredydd,</HI> gran-fa∣ther to the famous Sir <HI>John,</HI> author of the memoirs of the family. This shews 1553, the supposed time of the death of the former, to be a mistake. The place takes its name from <HI>Gwaed-dir,</HI> the bloody land, from the battles fought here by <HI>Llywarch Hên</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Works.</NOTE>, about the year 610; or perhaps from the cruel battle in 952, between the sons of <HI>Hoel,</HI> and the princes <HI>Jevaf</HI> and <HI>Iago</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 60.</NOTE>; and a third may be added, between <HI>Gryffydd ap Cynan,</HI> and <HI>Trahaern ap Cradog,</HI> equally bloody<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> his Life.</NOTE> The supposition that it was de∣rived from its being the first house in <HI>Wales</HI> which had <HI>glass win∣dows,</HI> is not well founded, those conveniences having been known long before. Sir <HI>John Wynne</HI> himself even mentions a date of 1512, on a window at <HI>Dolwyddelan,</HI> which is long before the building of <HI>Gwedir.</HI> But the following lines of a poet, who flourished some centuries before, is still a stronger proof of the antiquity of glass in our country:

<L>They see me through the glass windows.</L></Q></P>
<P>ON a rock, high above the <HI>Lower Gwedir,</HI> stood another, called <HI>The Upper,</HI> seemingly built for the enjoyment of the beautiful view it commands of the rich meadows watered by the <HI>Conwy,</HI> and their elegant boundaries. It was a sort of <HI>Diaeta,</HI> or summer-house, erected by Sir <HI>John Wynne,</HI> in 1604, who had a classical taste. The walls were covered with inscriptions; and the situation well deserved the panegyric bestowed on it in the following <HI>Welsh</HI> lines, placed over the entrance:

<P>SIR <HI>John</HI> was sent to <HI>London</HI> in 1574, to study the law; was a man of abilities, and particularly attentive to the antiquities of his country and family. His consequence made him to be taken notice of by the court; for he was made a baronet in <HI>June</HI> 1611.</P>

<P>FROM hence to <HI>Llanrwst</HI> is a pretty walk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANRWST BRIDGE.</NOTE> mostly by the side of the river. The town lies in <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> on the opposite bank. The approach is over the bridge, the boasted plan of <HI>Inigo Jones.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">INIGO JONES.</NOTE> It consists of three arches; the middle fifty-nine feet wide: two are extremely beautiful, and mark the hand of the architect: the third differs greatly, having been re-built in 1703, by a very inferior genius.

<P>THERE is one circumstance attending this great genius, which deserves mention, as it bears some relation to the country from whence he may have derived his origin. When he was em∣ployed to furnish rare devices, and paint the scenery for the masques of the festive year 1619, he painted the <HI>Creigie'r eira,</HI> or a scene in <HI>Snowdonia,</HI> for the masque FOR THE HONOUR OF
<PB N="143" REF="152"/>
WALES. He did it with such success, as to excite the envy of the poet, <HI>Ben Jonson;</HI> for the scenes were more admired than the entertainment, which might very well be: but <HI>Jonson</HI> was so offended; as to give vent to his spleen in a copy of verses, as im∣becil as they were rancorous and ill-founded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ben. Jonson</HI>'s Works, vi. 294.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE river here makes a handsome appearance, extending in a direct line far above the bridge, and often enlivened with the coracles, the <HI>vitilia navigia</HI> of the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> busied in tak∣ing salmon; and in the months of <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> numbers of smelt. The tide does not flow nearer than <HI>Llyn y Graig,</HI> a mile and half below the bridge, where, in spring tides, boats of twelve tons may come.</P>
<P>THE town of <HI>Llanrwst</HI> is small,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN OF LLAN∣RWST, AND CHURCH.</NOTE> and ill built; and has nothing remarkable, except the church, which is dedicated to <HI>St. Rystyd,</HI> or <HI>Restitutus,</HI> archbishop of <HI>London</HI> in 361, present at the council of <HI>Arles</HI> in 353. The ground on which it is built, is said to have been given by <HI>Rhun,</HI> the son of <HI>Nefydd Hardd,</HI> to expiate the foul murder of prince <HI>Idwal,</HI> a son of <HI>Owen Gwynedd,</HI> slain by order of his foster-father, <HI>Nefydd,</HI> to whom he had been intrusted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">XV.

<P>A VERY plain stone records the death of his eldest brother, Sir <HI>John Wynne,</HI> knight, who died at <HI>Lucca,</HI> on his travels, in 1614, and was buried there, in the parish of <HI>St. John.</HI> I have seen numbers of his letters, which shew him to have been a very observant man; some of which may, in the Appendix, be an amusement to the reader.</P>
<P>ONE other tomb, of far greater antiquity than the others, re∣mains to be mentioned; that of <HI>Howel Coytmor,</HI> whose figure, armed, is represented in stone. He was gran-son of the knight at <HI>Bettws;</HI> owned <HI>Gwedir,</HI> which was sold by one of his poste∣rity to the family of the <HI>Wynnes,</HI></P>
<P>IN this church is preserved the stone coffin of <HI>Llewelyn the Great,</HI> with the sides curiously cut into quatre-foils. That prince was enterred in <HI>Conwy</HI> abby; but at the dissolution, the coffin was removed to this place.</P>
<P>I MADE from <HI>Llanrwst</HI> two excursions; one to visit <HI>Maynan Abby,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MAYNAN ABBY.</NOTE> translated hither in 1289, from <HI>Conwy,</HI> by permission of pope <HI>Nicholas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> ii. 427.</NOTE>, as he says, at the request of <HI>Edward</HI> I. and the monks.

<PB N="146" REF="157"/>
this house, at the dissolution, were, according to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> one hundred and sixty-two pounds fifteen shillings; to <HI>Speed,</HI> one hundred and seventy-nine pounds ten shillings and ten pence. The last abbot was <HI>Richard Kyffyn</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis</HI> calls him <HI>Richard ap Rhys.</HI></NOTE>, who had a pension of twenty pounds a year. The abby was granted, in the fifth of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to <HI>Elizeus Wynne;</HI> and it is still possessed by his descendant, lady <HI>Wynne,</HI> widow of the late Sir <HI>John Wynne,</HI> of <HI>Glynllivon.</HI> A large old house, built from the materials of the abby, still remains.</P>
<P>I RETURNED through <HI>Llanrwst,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TREFRIW.</NOTE> and, about two miles beyond, high over the <HI>Conwy,</HI> visit the village of <HI>Trefriw,</HI> where num∣bers of small vessels are built, and sent down the river at spring tides. It is said that <HI>Llewelyn the Great</HI> had near this place a palace; and, as a proof, several hewen stones have been found, in ploughing a field called <HI>Gardd y Neuodd.</HI> The church of <HI>Trefriw</HI> was originally built by <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> for the ease of his prin∣cess, who before was obliged to foot it to <HI>Llanrhychwyn,</HI> a long walk among the mountains<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> MS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM hence I went back as far as <HI>Gwedir,</HI> and ascend a very steep hill, leaving the park belonging to the house on the left. Go over an open space, called <HI>Bwlch yr Haiarn,</HI> full of turbe∣ries, the providential fuel of the country. Some lead-mines have been discovered in these parts, but none of any consequence. The <HI>Gale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GALE, OR BOG MYRTLE.</NOTE> or bog myrtle, abounds here, and perfumes the air with its spicy smell. It is a northern plant, but does not extend
<PB N="147" REF="158"/>
far. It is found in <HI>Lapland, Norway,</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and several parts of the <HI>Alpine</HI> situations of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> It is called <HI>Bwrli,</HI> or the emetic plant; and <HI>Gnwyrddling,</HI> or green plant. Our countrymen use it as a yellow dye. They lay branches of it upon and under their beds, to keep off fleas and moths; and also give it in powder or infusion, and apply it to the abdomen as a vermifuge. It is besides sometimes used as a <HI>succedancum</HI> for hops.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sorbus Aucuparia,</HI> or mountain ash, is frequent in these parts. The poorer sort of people make a drink, called <HI>diod∣griafel,</HI> by infusing the berries in water. In former times, a su∣perstitious use was made of the wood: a piece, made in form of a cross, was carried in the pocket, as an infallible preservative against all sorts of fascinations.</P>
<P>AFTER gaining the summit, visit, to the right, <HI>Llyn Geirion∣nydd,</HI> a small lake, noted for having had near it the habitation of the celebrated <HI>Taliesin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TALIESIN.</NOTE> who flourished about the year 560, in the time of <HI>Gwyddno Goronhir,</HI> a petty prince of <HI>Cantre'r Gwaelod.</HI> The history of our famous bard begins like that of <HI>Moses;</HI> for he was found exposed on the water, wrapped in a leathern bag, in a wear which had been granted to <HI>Elphin,</HI> son of <HI>Gwyddno,</HI> for his support. The young prince, reduced by his extravagance, burst into tears, at finding, as he imagined, so unprofitable a booty. He took pity on the infant, and caused proper care to be taken of him. After this, <HI>Elphin</HI> prospered; and <HI>Taliesin,</HI> when he grew up, addressed to him the following moral ode, styled <HI>Dyhuddiant</HI> ELPHIN, or ELPHIN'S <HI>Consolation;</HI> supposed to have been addressed to the prince by the infant bard, on the night he

<P>FROM this lake I desended a great steep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLYN LLUGWY.</NOTE> into <HI>Glyn Llugwy,</HI> a bottom watered by-the <HI>Llugwy,</HI> fertile in grass, and varied by small groves of young oaks; very unlike the great woods which cloathed this place, <HI>Dyffryn Mymbyr, Llanberis,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> in the time of <HI>Leland</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Litin</HI> v. 45</NOTE>. Go through a narrow pass, high above a raging torrent, falling in broken cascades from rock to rock. At a small distance from hence, enter <HI>Dyffryn Mymbyr,</HI> a valley in which woods, and even trees, disappear. The small church of <HI>Capel Kerig,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPEL KERIG.</NOTE> and a few scattered houses, give a little life to this dreary tract. <HI>Snowdon</HI> and all his sons, <HI>Crib Coch, Crib y Distill, Lliweddy yr Aran,</HI> and many others, here burst at once full in view, and make this far the finest approach
<PB REF="162"/><FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE SUMMIT OF SNOWDON FROM CAPEL CERIG</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="151" REF="163"/>to our boasted <HI>Alps.</HI> The boundaries of this vale are, on one side, the base of the crooked mountain, <HI>Moel Siabod;</HI> on the other, that of the <HI>Gludar Bach,</HI> and several other hills of lesser note. The bottom is meadowy; at this time enlivened with the busy work of hay harvest, and filled with drags, horses, and even men and women, loaden with hay. The middle is varied with two small lakes, along whose sides we rode; and at some distance beyond them, near <HI>Pont y Gwryd,</HI> quitted our horses, to visit the summit of the <HI>Glyder,</HI> noted for the report the editor of <HI>Cambden</HI> had made, of the singular disposition of the rocks. We directed our servants to go on to <HI>Llanberis,</HI> with our steeds. The ascent was extremely long, steep, and laborious, wet and slippery; and almost the whole way covered with loose fragments of rocks, be∣neath which was a continual roar of waters, seeking their way to the bottom.</P>
<P>OUR pains were fully repaid, on attaining the summit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLYDER BACH.</NOTE> The area was covered with groupes of columnar stones, of vast size, from ten to thirty feet long, lying in all directions: most of them were of a columnar form, often piled on one another: in other places, half erect, sloping down, and supported by others, which lie without any order at their bases. The tops are frequently crowned in the strangest manner with other stones, lying on them horizontally. One was about twenty-five feet long, and six broad: I climbed up, and, on stamping it with my foot, felt a strong tremulous motion from end to end. Another, eleven feet long, and six in circumference in the thinnest part, was poised so nicely on the point of a rock, that, to appearance, the touch of
<PB N="152" REF="164"/>
a child would overset it. A third enormous mass had the pro∣perty of a rocking stone.</P>
<P>MANY of the stones had, bedded in them, shells; and in their neighborhood I found several pieces of lava. I would therefore rather consider this mountain to have been a sort of wreck of nature, formed and flung up by some mighty internal convulsion, which has given these vast groupes of stones fortuitously such a strange disposition; for had they been the settled strata, bared of their earth by a long series of rains, they would have retained the regular appearance, as we observe in all other beds of similar matter.</P>
<P>ONE side of this mountain is formed into a gap, <HI>berissce,</HI> I may call it, with sharp rocks, pointing upwards, one above the other, to a great height. In the midst of a vale far below, rises the sin∣gular mountain <HI>Trevaen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TREVAEN.</NOTE> assuming on this side a pyramidal form, naked, and very rugged. A precipice, from whose summit I surveyed the strange scene, forbad my approach to examine the nature of its composition; and whether it might not have been suspected of being formed at the same time with the phoenomena on the top of its neighbor <HI>Glyder:</HI> for I have heard that insu∣lated mountains of this form often appear at the base of greater, which have been supposed to owe their origin to volcanic force.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Glyder Bach</HI> I passed over a plain, above half a mile broad, called <HI>Y Waun Oer, The Chilly Mountainous Flat.</HI> Ob∣serve from the edge, in a tremendous hollow, <HI>Llyn y Boch Llwyd,</HI> or <HI>The Lake of the Grey Goat;</HI> and in the bottom of the valley,
<PB N="153" REF="165"/>
near the foot of the <HI>Trevaen, Llyn Ogwen,</HI> noted for its fine trout.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Waen Oer</HI> we made a most hazardous descent to <HI>Cwm Bochllwyd,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Llyn Ogwen.</HI> The way from that place into the valley, or rather chasm, of <HI>Nant Frankon,</HI> is called <HI>The Ben-glog,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BEN-GLOG.</NOTE> the most dreadful horse path in <HI>Wales,</HI> worked in the rudest manner into steps, for a great length. On one side, in a deep hollow, formed under fallen rocks, was once the hiding place of <HI>Rys Goch o'r Eryri,</HI> or <HI>Rhys the Red,</HI> of <HI>Snowdon;</HI> a mountain bard, patronised by <HI>Robert Meredydd,</HI> a partizan of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> an outlawed chieftain, of whose fortunes he partook.I do assure the traveller, who delights in wild na∣ture, that a visit to it up <HI>Nant Frankon,</HI> from <HI>Bangor,</HI> will not be repented. The waters of five lakes dart down the precipice of the middle of the <HI>Benglog,</HI> and form the torrent of the <HI>Ogwen,</HI> which falls into the sea a few miles lower. This bottom is sur∣rounded with mountains of a stupendous height, mostly preci∣pitous; the tops of many edged with pointed rocks, I have, from the depth beneath, seen the shepherds skipping from peak to peak; but the point of contact was so small, that from this distance they seemed to my uplifted eyes like beings of another order, floating in the air.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Trevaen,</HI> from this bottom, makes also a very singular ap∣pearance, resembling a human face, reclined backward. Fore∣head, nose, lips, and chin, are very apparent; and you may add, without any great strain of fancy, the beard of an antient inha∣bitant, an arch-druid.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="166"/>BEGIN another hard ascent to <HI>Cwm Idwal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM IDWAL.</NOTE> infamous for the murder of a young prince of that name, son of <HI>Owen Gwynedd,</HI> by <HI>Dunawt,</HI> son of <HI>Nefydd Hardd,</HI> one of the fif∣teen tribes of <HI>North Wales,</HI> to whom <HI>Owen</HI> had entrusted the youth, to be fostered, according to the custom of the country. It was a fit place to inspire murderous thoughts, environed with horrible precipices, shading a lake, lodged in its bottom. The shepherds fable, that it is the haunt of <HI>Daemons;</HI> and that no bird dare fly over its damned water, fatal as that of <HI>Avernus.</HI>

<P>NEAR this place is a quarry, noted for excellent hones, of which quantities are sent annually to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>A NEW and greater toil is to be undergone in the ascent from <HI>Cwm Idwal,</HI> to the heights I had left. The way lies beneath that vast precipice, <HI>Castell y Geifr,</HI> or <HI>The Castle of the Goats.</HI> In some distant age, the ruins of a rocky mountain formed a road by a mighty lapse. A stream of stones, each of monstrous size, points towards the <HI>Cwm;</HI> and are to be clambered over by those only, who possess a degree of bodily activity, as well as strength of head to bear the sight of the dreadful hollows frequent beneath them.</P>
<P>OBSERVE, on the right, a stupendous <HI>roche fendue,</HI> or split rock, called <HI>Twll-Du,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TWLL DU.</NOTE> and <HI>The Devil's Kitchen.</HI> It is a horrible gap, in the center of a great black precipice, extending in length
<PB N="155" REF="167"/>
about a hundred and fifty yards; in depth, about a hundred; and only six wide; perpendicularly open to the surface of the mountain. On surmounting all my difficulties, and taking a little breath, I ventured to look down this dreadful aperture, and found its horrors far from being lessened, in my exalted si∣tuation; for to it were added the waters of <HI>Llyn y Cwn,</HI> impe∣tuously rushing through its bottom.</P>
<P>REACH the <HI>Glyder Vawr,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">KLOGWYN DU.</NOTE> and pass by the edge of <HI>Klogwyn Du Ymben y Glyder,</HI> as dreadful a precipice as any in <HI>Snowdonia,</HI> hanging over the dire waters of <HI>Llyn Idwal.</HI> Its neighborhood is of great note among botanists for rare plants, among which may be reckoned the <HI>Saxifraga Nivalis, Bulbocodium,</HI> and the <HI>Lichen Islandicus,</HI> The last is of singular use to the <HI>Icelanders.</HI> A decoction of the fresh leaves in water serves them in the spring as a powerful cathartic; and yet, when dried, changes its qua∣lity, and if grinded to powder, is a common food, either made into bread, or boiled with milk, or water. <HI>Haller</HI> and <HI>Scopoli</HI> also mention its use, at their time, in <HI>Vienna,</HI> in coughs and consumptions, made into broth, or gruel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lightfoot's Fl.

are weather-beaten, time-eaten, and honey-combed, and of a ve∣nerable grey color. The elements seemed to have warred against this mountain: rains have washed, lightnings torn, the very earth deserted it, and the winds made it the constant object of their fury. The shepherds make it the residence of storms, and style a part of it <HI>Carnedd y Gwynt,</HI> or <HI>The Eminence of Tempests.</HI></P>
<P>THIS mountain is connected to the lesser <HI>Glyder</HI> by the <HI>Weyn Oer:</HI> the traveller therefore has his choice of ways to these won∣drous mountains; but the most: preferable for ease, is the road I descend into the vale of <HI>Llanberis.</HI> In my way, pass close by a rugged brow of a hill, which I think is <HI>Rhiw y Glyder,</HI> recorded by LLWYD and RAY, for its variety of plants. From thence descend by <HI>Oleu Fawr.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after, visit the small lake, called <HI>Llyn y Cwn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN Y CWN.</NOTE> noted for the tale of <HI>Giraldus;</HI> who informs us, that in his days, the three kinds of fish it yielded, trouts, perch, and eels, were mon∣ocular, every one wanting the left eye. At present, there is not a fish in it to disprove the relation. To make amends, the botanist will find in it the <HI>Lobelia Dortmanna, Sabularia Aquatica,</HI> and <HI>Isoetis Lacustris;</HI> and not far from it, the <HI>Juncus Triglumis,</HI> common to this, and some of the <HI>Highland</HI> mountains. The <HI>Hieracium Alpinum, Ruhus Saxatilis, Solidago Cambrica,</HI> and other rare plants, are to be met with. In the course of this part of the descent, leave o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the right <HI>Llider Vawr</HI> and <HI>Llider Vach,</HI> two great mountains, part of the boundaries of <HI>Nant-Beris;</HI> and ar∣rive in that vale by <HI>Caunant yr Esgar,</HI> or <HI>The Dingle of the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a very picturesque vale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NANT-BERIS.</NOTE> bounded by the base of

<PB N="157" REF="170"/><HI>Snowdon, Cefn Cwm Gafr,</HI> the two <HI>Glyders,</HI> and two <HI>Lliders,</HI> each of them first-rate mountains. It is strait, and of nearly an equal breadth, filled by some meadows, and two magnificent lakes, which communicate to each other by means of a river. The venerable oaks, spoken of by <HI>Leland,</HI> are no more. Ava∣rice, or dissipation, and its constant follower, poverty, have de∣spoiled much of our principality of its leafy beauties. Among the numberless errors of this performance, I fear the word is cloathed with trees, must be supplied by the traveller with WAS. But this shadeless tract is still worthy his attention. A road, once a succession of rude and stony stairs, made with much la∣bor, ran on one side, high above the lake, and was often cut out of the rock, to form the way. This is, I am now informed, changed into a road, which too much facilitates the approach, and lessens its propriety, and its agreement with the wild en∣virons.</P>
<P>ON the loftiest part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL DOLBA∣DERN.</NOTE> over one of the lakes, stand the remains of <HI>Castell Dolbadern,</HI> consisting of a round tower, and a few frag∣ments of walls. It was constructed with the thin laminated stones of the country, cemented with very strong mortar, with∣out shells. The inner diameter of the tower is only twenty-six feet. This seems to have been built to defend the pass into the interior parts of <HI>Snowdonia;</HI> and it was likewise used as a state prison. The founder is unknown to me; but it was evidently a <HI>Welsh</HI> prince.</P>
<P>IN this valley are two groupes of wretched houses. The farthest is near the end of the upper lake, with its church, dedi∣cated to <HI>St. Peris,</HI> who was, as we are told, a cardinal. Here
<PB N="158" REF="171"/>
is to be seen the well of the saint, inclosed with a wall. The sybil of the place attends, and divines your fortune by the appearance or non-appearance of a little fish, which lurks in some of its holes.</P>
<P>FROM hence I took a ride above the lakes, to their lower ex∣tremity. The upper is the lesser, but much the most beautiful piece of water. It is said to be in places a hundred and forty yards deep; to have abounded with char, before they were re∣duced by the streams flowing from the copper mines, which had been worked on the sides of the hills. The lower lake is about a mile and a half long, narrows gradually into the form of a river, called the <HI>Rythell,</HI> and flows in a diffused channel to <HI>Caer∣narvon,</HI> where it assumes the name of <HI>Seiont.</HI></P>
<P>NEAR this end of the lake lived a celebrated personage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MARGARET UCH EVAN.</NOTE> whom I was disappointed in not finding at home. This was <HI>Margaret uch Evan,</HI> of <HI>Penllyn,</HI> the last specimen of the strength and spirit of the antient <HI>British</HI> fair. This extraordinary female was the greatest hunter, shooter, and fisher of her time. She kept a dozen at lest of dogs, terriers, grehounds, and spaniels, all excel∣lent in their kinds. She killed more foxes in one year, than all the confederate hunts do in ten: rowed stoutly, and was queen of the lake: fiddled excellently, and knew all our old music: did not neglect the mechanic arts, for she was a very good joiner: and notwithstanding she was seventy years of age, was the best wrestler in the country, and few young men dared to try a fall with her. Some years ago, she had a maid of con∣genial qualities; but death, that mighty hunter, at last earthed this faithful companion of her's. I must not forget, that all the
<PB N="159" REF="172"/>
neighboring bards payed their addresses to <HI>Margaret,</HI> and cele∣brated her exploits in pure <HI>British</HI> verse.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a mile farther, I visited the remains of <HI>Llŷs Di∣norwig,</HI> a house said to have been one of the palaces of prince <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd:</HI> the walls high and strong; the hall twenty-four yards long; and before the house is a deep ditch, over which had probably been a draw-bridge. Not very far from hence is a spot, called <HI>Rhiw'r Cyrn,</HI> or <HI>The Brow of the Horns;</HI> where, ac∣cording to old usage, an officer stood and blew his horn, to give notice to the houshold of the approach of their master, or to summon the vassals to assemble on all emergent occasions.</P>
<P>THIS country is part of the woodless flat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRITISH POSTS.</NOTE> between the moun∣tains and the <HI>Menai.</HI> Its want of strength is supplied with se∣veral posts, fortified in the <HI>British</HI> manner. <HI>Dinas Dinorwig,</HI> about half a mile south of the church of <HI>Llandeniolen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the church-yard is an yew tree, twenty-seven feet in girth.</NOTE>, is the chief. The area is very large, surrounded with an agger of small stones, backed by another of very large ones: then suc∣ceeds a deep ditch, a rampart of earth, a second vast ditch, and a third rampart: within the area is a circle of stones, the post probably of the commander in chief.</P>
<P>IN our way from hence, we passed by another, called <HI>Pen y Gaer;</HI> and soon after, by a smaller, called <HI>Bryn y Castrelau,</HI> sur∣rounded with a single wall; and on a rising on the other side of the <HI>Rythell,</HI> is another, named <HI>Caer Cwm y Glo,</HI> or <HI>Caer Carreg-y-Fran,</HI> from which had been (as we were informed) a paved way to <HI>Llŷs Dinorwig.</HI> I may here add, that after the death of
<PB N="160" REF="173"/>
<HI>Llewelyn, Edward</HI> I. bestowed that palace on Sir <HI>Gryffydd Llwyd,</HI> the same gentleman who first brought him the news of the birth of his son <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Caernarvon.</HI></P>
<P>RETURN by the same road, and, after refreshing myself with a night's rest at Mr. <HI>Close</HI>'s, agent to the mines in <HI>Llanberris,</HI> early in the morning begin our ascent to the highest peak, of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> under the guidance of <HI>Hugh Shone,</HI> whom I beg leave to recom∣mend as a most able conductor. Keep upon the side of the lake for a considerable way; then turn to the left, and see, not far from the road, <HI>Caunant Mawr,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAUNANT MAWR.</NOTE> a noble cataract, precipitating over two vast rocks into two most horrible chasms. Near this place were found several beads; some of glass, and one of jet.</P>
<P>ASCEND, above <HI>Cwm Brwynog,</HI> a very deep bottom, fertile in <HI>Gwair y Rhosydd,</HI> which is composed chiefly of different kinds of rushes, particularly <HI>Juncus Squarrosus,</HI> the moss-rush, <HI>Scirpus Caspitosus,</HI> the heath club rush, <HI>Schaenus Nigricans,</HI> the black bog rush, and <HI>Carexes,</HI> intermixed with few kinds of grass. The hay which the lower meadows produce, is very different in qua∣lity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GRASSES.</NOTE> being remarkably fine and soft; and consists in great part of the fine bent grass, <HI>Agrostis Capillaris.</HI> As we are on the subject of grasses, it may be pleasing to observe, how some of them wonderfully change their appearance, as they ascend the higher hills: the turfy hair grass, <HI>Aira Caespitosa,</HI> sheep's fescue grass, <HI>Pestuca Ovina,</HI> Alpine meadow grass, <HI>Poa Alpina,</HI> and some others, which, in the low countries, where they enjoy the due influence of the sun, and length of summer, to ripen their seeds, are propagated in the common manner that grasses are;
<PB N="161" REF="174"/>
as they reach a more exalted situation, where they want conti∣nuance of summer, and the necessary power of that enlivening body, to perfect their seeds, become viviparous; that is, the ru∣diment of the <HI>Germen</HI> vegetates, and shoots into blade in the cup, from whence falling, it readily takes root, and grows; a kind and providential dispensation, for the advantage of those colder climates, which are less favorable to vegetation!</P>
<P>THIS mountanous tract scarcely yields any corn. Its produce is cattle and sheep, which, during summer, keep very high in the mountains, followed by their owners, with their families, who reside in that season in <HI>Havodtys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUMMER DWELLINGS.</NOTE> or summer dairy-houses, as the farmers in the <HI>Swiss Alps</HI> do in their <HI>Sennes.</HI> These houses consist of a long low room, with a hole at one end, to let out the smoke from the fire, which is made beneath. Their furniture is very simple: stones are the substitutes of stools; and the beds are of hay, ranged along the sides. They manufacture their own cloaths; and dye their cloths with <HI>Cenn du y Cerrig,</HI> or <HI>Lichen Omphaloides;</HI> and another <HI>Cenn,</HI> the <HI>Lichen Parietinus;</HI> native dyes, collected from the rocks. During summer, the men pass their time either in harvest work, or in tending their herds: the women in milking, or making butter and cheese. For their own use, they milk both ewes and goats, and make cheese of the milk, for their own consumption. The diet of these mounta∣neers is very plain, consisting of butter, cheese, and oat-bread, or <HI>Bara Cyrch:</HI> their drink whey: not but they have a reserve of a few bottles of very strong beer, by way of cordial, in illness. They are people of good understanding, wary and circumspect; usually tall, thin, and of strong constitutions, from their way of
<PB N="162" REF="175"/>
living. Towards winter, they descend to their <HI>Hên Dref,</HI> or <HI>old dwelling,</HI> where they lead, during winter, a vacant life.</P>
<P>IN the course of our ascent, saw on the left, above the <HI>Cwm, Moel y Cynhorion,</HI> or <HI>The Hill of Council.</HI> Pass through <HI>Bwlch y Maes-cwm,</HI> and skirt the side of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> till we reach <HI>Bwlch y Cwm Brwynog,</HI> where the ascent becomes very difficult, by reason of its vast steepness. People here usually quit their horses. We began a toilsome march, clambering among the rocks. On the left were the precipices over <HI>Cwm Brwynog,</HI> with <HI>Llyn du yr Ard∣dwy</HI> at their foot. On our right were those over the small lakes <HI>Llyn Glâs, Llyn y-Nadroedd,</HI> and <HI>Llyn Coch.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE HIGH LAKES.</NOTE> The last is the highest on this side of the mountain; and on whose margins, we were told, that, in fairy days, those diminutive gentry kept their revels. This space between precipice and precipice, forms a short, and no very agreeable isthmus, till we reached a verdant expanse, which gave us some respite, before we labored up ano∣ther series of broken crags: after these, is a second smooth tract, which reaches almost to the summit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOP OF SNOWDON.</NOTE> which, by way of pre-emi∣nence, is styled Y WYDDFA, or <HI>The Conspicuous.</HI> It rises almost to a point, or, at best, there is but room for a circular wall of loose stones, within which travellers usually take their repast.</P>
<P>THE mountain from hence seems propped by four vast buttresses; between which are four deep <HI>Cwms,</HI> or hollows: each, excepting one, had one or more lakes, lodged in its distant bot∣tom The nearest was <HI>Fsynnon Lás,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FYNNON LAS.</NOTE> or <HI>The Green Well,</HI> lying im∣mediately below us. One of the company had the curiosity to descend a very bad way to a jutting rock, that impended over the monstrous precipice; and he seemed like <HI>Mercury</HI> ready to
<PB N="163" REF="176"/>
take his flight from the summit of <HI>Atlas.</HI> The waters of <HI>Ffynnon Lâs,</HI> from this height, appeared black and unfathomable, and the edges quite green. From thence is a succession of bottoms, surrounded by the most lofty and rugged hills, the greatest part of whose sides are quite mural, and form the most magnificent amphitheatre in nature. The <HI>Wyddfa</HI> is on one side; <HI>Crib y Distill,</HI> with its serrated tops, on another; <HI>Crib Coch,</HI> a ridge of fiery redness, appears beneath the preceding; and opposite to it is the boundary called the <HI>Lliwedd.</HI> Another very singular sup∣port to this mountain is <HI>Y Clawdd Coch,</HI> rising into a sharp ridge, so narrow, as not to afford breadth even for a path.</P>
<P>THE view from this exalted situation is unbounded. In a former tour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">August 25th Old Stile.</NOTE>, I saw from it the county of <HI>Chester,</HI> the high hills of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> part of the north of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> a plain view of the <HI>Isle of Man;</HI> and that of <HI>Anglesea</HI> lay extended like a map beneath us, with every rill visible. I took much pains to see this prospect to advantage; sat up at a farm on the west till about twelve, and walked up the whole way. The night was remarkably fine and starry: towards morn, the stars faded away, and left a short interval of darkness, which was soon dis∣persed by the dawn of day. The body of the sun appeared most distinct, with the rotundity of the moon, before it rose high enough to render its beams too brilliant for our sight. The sea which bounded the western part was gilt by its beams, first in slender streaks, at length glowed with redness. The prospect was disclosed to us like the gradual drawing up of a curtain in a
<PB N="164" REF="177"/>
theatre. We saw more and more, till the heat became so power∣ful, as to attract the mists from the various lakes, which in a slight degree obscured the prospect. The shadow of the moun∣tain was flung many miles, and shewed its bicapitated form; the <HI>Wyddfa</HI> making one, <HI>Crib y Distill</HI> the other head. I counted this time between twenty and thirty lakes, either in this county, or <HI>Meirionyddshire.</HI> The day proved so excessively hot, that my journey cost me the skin of the lower part of my face, before I reached the resting-place, after the fatigue of the morning.</P>
<P>ON this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">August 15th, New Stile.</NOTE>, the sky was obscured very soon after I got up. A vast mist enveloped the whole circuit of the mountain. The prospect down was horrible. It gave an idea of numbers of abysses, concealed by a thick smoke, furiously circulating around us. Very often a gust of wind formed an opening in the clouds, which gave a fine and distinct visto of lake and valley. Some∣times they opened only in one place; at others, in many at once, exhibiting a most strange and perplexing sight of water, fields, rocks, or chasms, in fifty different places. They then closed at once, and left us involved in darkness: in a small space, they would separate again, and fly in wild eddies round the middle of the mountains, and expose, in parts, both tops and bases clear to our view. We descended from this various scene with great reluctance; but before we reached our horses, a thunder storm overtook us. Its rolling among the mountains was inexpressibly awful: the rain uncommonly heavy. We re-mounted our horses, and gained the bottom with great hazard. The little
<PB N="165" REF="178"/>
rills, which on our ascent trickled along the gullies on the sides of the mountain, were now swelled into torrents; and we and our steeds passed with the utmost risque of being swept away by these sudden waters. At length we arrived safe, yet sufficiently wet and weary, to our former quarters.</P>
<P>IT is very rare that the traveller gets a proper day to ascend the hill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ATTRACTION OF CLOUDS.</NOTE> for it often appears clear, but by the evident attraction of the clouds by this lofty mountain, it becomes suddenly and unexpectedly enveloped in mist, when the clouds have just be∣fore appeared very remote, and at great heights. At times, I have observed them lower to half their height, and notwithstand∣ing they had been dispersed to the right and to the left, yet they have met from both sides, and united to involve the summit in one great obsscurity.</P>
<P>THE quantity of water which flows from the lakes of <HI>Snow∣donia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVERS.</NOTE> is very considerable; so much, that I doubt not but col∣lectively they would exceed the waters of the <HI>Thames,</HI> before it meets the flux of the ocean.</P>
<P>THE reports of the height of this noted hill have been very differently given.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HEIGHT.</NOTE> A Mr. <HI>Caswell,</HI> who was employed by Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> in 1682, in a survey of <HI>Wales,</HI> measured it by instruments made by the directions of Mr. <HI>Flamstead:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wren's Parentalia,</HI> i. 253. I suppose; <HI>Caswell</HI> was employed by Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> author of the <HI>Index Villeris.</HI></NOTE>; and asserts its height to have been twelve hundred and forty yards: but for the honor of our mountain I am sorry to say, that I must give greater credit to the experiments made of late years, which have sunk it to
<PB N="166" REF="179"/>
one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine yards and one foot, reckoning from the quay at <HI>Caernarvon</HI> to the highest peak.</P>
<P>THE stone that composes this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">STRATA.</NOTE> and indeed the greatest part of <HI>Snowdonia,</HI> is excessively hard. Large coarse crystals are often found in the fissures, and very frequently cubic <HI>pyritae,</HI> the usual attendants on <HI>Alpine</HI> tracts. These are also frequented by the rock ouzel, a mountain bird; and some of the lakes are stocked with <HI>char</HI> and <HI>gwyniads, Alpine</HI> fish. The antient inhabitant, the goat, decreases daily in value, since the decline of orthodoxal wigs, to which its snowy hair universally contributed. Still large flocks are kept for the dairy, and milked with great regularity.</P>
<P>BOTANY is not within my province.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOTANY.</NOTE> I shall therefore say no∣thing more of the plants, than that those species which LIN∣NAEUS so very expressively styles. <HI>Aethereae,</HI> are entirely confined to the higher parts of the mountains; and notwithstanding the seeds must be blown downwards, they never vegetate in the lower parts, which are deserted by certain plants, which are natives of a higher tract of the same hill.</P>
<P>THE animals of these regions are chiefly foxes. Stags were found here in the days of <HI>Leland,</HI> in such numbers, as to destroy the little corn which the farmers attempted to sow: but they were extirpated before the year 1626<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gwedir</HI> MSS.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A ROYAl FOREST.</NOTE> <HI>Snowdon</HI> being a royal forest, warrants were issued for the killing of the deer. I have seen one from the duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> dated <HI>April</HI> the 30th, 1552; and another, in the first year of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> signed by <HI>Robert To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nesend;</HI> and a third, in 1561, by <HI>Henry Sydney.</HI> The second

In consequence, he tyrannized over the counties with great insolence. A set of informers imme∣diately acquainted him, that most of the freeholders estates might be brought within the boundaries. Commissioners were ap∣pointed to enquire of the encroachments and concealments of lands within the forest. Juries were empannelled; but their re∣turns were rejected by the commissioners, as unfavorable to the earl's designs. The jurors performed an honest part, and found a verdict for the country. <HI>Leland,</HI> who, no longer before than the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. had gone over this tract, as he did most of <HI>England,</HI> under the royal commission; and yet reports, that all <HI>Cregery, i. e. Snowdon,</HI> is in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> and no part in <HI>Merionethshire;</HI> though, says he, that shire be <HI>montanius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Itin</HI> V. 43.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A NEW commission was then directed to Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley,</HI> of <HI>Baron Hill, Anglesea,</HI> Sir <HI>William Herbert,</HI> and others; but this, by the firmness of Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> was likewise soon superseded. But, in 1578, another was appointed, dependent on the favorite. A packed jury was directed to appear at <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> who went on the same day to view the marsh of <HI>Malltraeth,</HI> ten miles distant; and found that marsh to be in the forest of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> notwith∣standing it was in another county, and divided from the forest
<PB N="168" REF="181"/>
by an arm of the sea; because the commissioners had told them, that they had met with an indictment in the exchequer of <HI>Gaernarvon</HI> (which they had the year before broke open and ransacked) by which they had discovered that a stag had been rouzed in the forest of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> was pursued to the banks of the <HI>Menai;</HI> that it swam over that branch of the sea, and was killed at <HI>Malltraeth</HI> INFRA <HI>forestam nostram de Snow∣don.</HI> The jury appeared in the earl's livery, blue, with ragged staves on the sleeves; and were ever after branded with the title of the <HI>black jury, who sold their country.</HI></P>
<P>SIR <HI>Richard Bulkeley,</HI> not the lest daunted with this decision, continued steady in his opposition to the tyrant; and laid be∣fore the Queen the odiousness of the proceedings, and the grievances her loyal subjects, the <HI>Welsh,</HI> labored under, by the commission, insomuch, in 1579, her highness was pleased, by pro∣clamation at <HI>Westminster,</HI> to recall it. <HI>Leicester,</HI> disappointed in his views, pursued Sir <HI>Richard</HI> with the utmost inveteracy: he even accused him of a concern in <HI>Babington</HI>'s conspiracy. <Q>BEFORE GOD,</Q> says the Queen, <Q>we will be sworn upon the evangelists, he never intended us any harm;</Q> and so ran to the bible, and kissed it, saying, <Q>We shall not commit him: we have brought him up from a boy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the communication of <HI>Paul Panton,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR></NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>THE <HI>Welsh</HI> had always the strongest attachment to the tract of <HI>Snowdon.</HI> It was, say they the appertenance of the principality of <HI>Wales,</HI> which the prince and his predecessors held since the time of <HI>Brute. Edward</HI> I. was told by the inhabitants of <HI>Snow∣don,</HI> in the treaty he held with our countrymen, in the year 1281, that even should their prince be inclined to gratify the king, in yielding him possession, they would not do homage to strangers, of whose tongue, manners, and laws, they were ignorant<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 369.</NOTE>. Our
<PB N="170" REF="183"/>
princes had, in addition to their title, that of LORD OF SNOWDON. They had five hardy barons within the tract, who held of them. Such was the importance of this strong region, that when <HI>Llewelyn</HI> was at the last extremity, he rejected the proposal of <HI>Edward,</HI> of a thousand a year, and some honorable county in <HI>England,</HI> well knowing that his principality must terminate with the cession.</P>
<P>No sooner had <HI>Edward</HI> effected his conquest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FAIR HELD THERE.</NOTE> than he held a triumphal fair upon this our chief of mountains; and adjourned to finish the joy of his victory, by solemn tournaments on the plains of <HI>Nevyn.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL take my leave of <HI>Snowdonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NAME.</NOTE> with some remarks on the name, and the weather. The first is a literal translation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the <HI>Saxons</HI> first into SNAWDUNE. <HI>Sax. Chr.</HI> 203.</NOTE> of the antient appellation, <HI>Creigie'r Eira, The Snowy Mountains,</HI> from the frequency of snow upon them. <HI>Niphates,</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> and <HI>Imaus,</HI> in <HI>Tartary,</HI> derive their name from the same circumstance. Some have supposed it to be taken from <HI>Creigiau'r Eryri,</HI> or <HI>The Eagle Rocks;</HI> but that bird appears very seldom among them. The other circumstance is constant: not that it is to be imagined that they are covered with snow in some part or other the whole year, as has been idly fabled; there being frequently whole weeks, even in winter, in which they are totally free.</P>
<P>THE earliest appearance of snow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WEATHER.</NOTE> is commonly between the middle of <HI>October,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>November:</HI> the falls which happen then, are usually washed away with the rains, and the hills remain clear till <HI>Christmas.</HI> Between that time and the end of <HI>January,</HI> the greatest falls happen; which are succeeded

by others, about the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> or beginning of <HI>May,</HI> which remain in certain places till the middle of <HI>June,</HI> in which month it has been seen of the depth of some feet. It has even happened, that the greatest fall has been in <HI>April,</HI> or beginning of <HI>May;</HI> and that never fails happening, when the preceding winter has had the smallest falls. But the fable of <HI>Giraldus,</HI> con∣cerning the continuance of snow the whole year, is totally to be exploded.</P>
<P>NEAR the end of <HI>Nant-beris,</HI> pass beneath <HI>Glyder Vawr,</HI> and observe the strata of a columnar form, high above our heads. At times, vast fragments of this tremendous rock tumble down, the ruins are scattered about the base, and exhibit awful speci∣mens of the frequent lapses. One is styled the <HI>Cromlech,</HI> for having accidentally fallen on other stones, it remains lifted from the earth, with a hollow beneath, resembling one of those <HI>Druidical</HI> antiquities. The length of the incumbent stone is sixty feet: the breadth forty-six: the thickness sixteen. The hollow is said once to have been occupied by an old woman; but now serves for a sheep pen.</P>
<P>THE ascent from hence is either over loose stones, or solid stair-case; and is exceedingly steep. It is a singular road, lying in a stupendous chasm, bounded for above a mile by nearly equidistant precipices, of prodigious height; on one side belong∣ing to the <HI>Glyders,</HI> on the other by the parts of <HI>Snowdon.</HI></P>

the picturesque vale of <HI>Nant Gwynnan,</HI> the scene of many a bloody skirmish in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. between <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and the <HI>Welsh Lancastrians,</HI> under <HI>Jevan ap Robert.</HI></P>
<P>DESCEND a very steep road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM DYLI.</NOTE> into that part called <HI>Cwm Dyli;</HI> where we quitted our horses, and began a most toilsome journey to visit the hidden vales lodged in the bosom of the mountains. We began with clambering up the rugged face of a rock, broken into a multitude of short precipices, and divided in the middle by a cataract, the discharge of the waters from the <HI>Alpine</HI> lakes. After about a quarter of a mile's labor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM DYLI UCHA.</NOTE> we reached <HI>Cwm y Cwm Dyli,</HI> a flat tract of hay ground, watered by a river, and filled with hay-makers; the farmer and his family being resident here in his <HI>Havodtu,</HI> for the summer season. After dining with them on curds and whey, we kept along the river's side, and found opposed to us another front, rugged as the former, and attended with a cataract. This was surmounted with equal difficulty. We found, on arriving at the top, a bottom a mile in length, filled with <HI>Llyn Llydaw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN LLYDAW.</NOTE> a fine lake, winding beneath the rocks, and vastly indented by rocky projections, here and there jutting into it. In it was one little island, the haunt of black-backed Gulls, which breed here, and, alarmed by such unexpected visi∣tants, broke the silence of this sequestered place by their deep screams. We continued our walk, ascending along a narrow path above the lake, as far as the extremity; then descending, reached the opposite side, in order to encounter a third descent, as arduous as the preceding. This brought us into the horrible <HI>crater,</HI> immediately beneath the great precipice of the <HI>Wyddfa,</HI> in which is lodged <HI>Ffynnen Lâs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FFYNNON LAS.</NOTE> Its situation is the most dread∣ful,
<PB N="173" REF="186"/>
surrounded by more than three parts of a circle, with the most horrible precipices of the <HI>Wyddfa, Crib y Distill,</HI> and <HI>Crib Coch,</HI> with the vast mural steeps of <HI>Lliwedd,</HI> continued over the other lake and <HI>Cwm Dyli.</HI> In the <HI>Lliwedd</HI> was a strange break, called <HI>Bwlch y Saethau,</HI> or <HI>The Pass of the Arrows;</HI> probably a station for hunters, to watch the wanderings of the deer.</P>
<P>THE margins of <HI>Ffynnon Lâs</HI> here appeared to be shallow and gravelly. The waters had a greenish cast; but what is very sin∣gular, the rocks reflected into them seemed varied with stripes of the richest colors, like the most beautiful lutestrings; and changed almost to infinity.</P>
<P>HERE we observed the <HI>Wheat-ear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEAT-EAR</NOTE> a small and seemingly ten∣der bird; and yet is almost the only small one, or indeed the only one, except the Rock Ouzel, or <HI>Mwyalchen y Graig,</HI> that frequents these heights▪ the reason is evidently the want of food.</P>
<P>WE descended from this dreary scene, on the other side of the hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CRIB COCH.</NOTE> above <HI>Llyn Llydaw,</HI> having the tremendous red preci∣pices of <HI>Crib Coch</HI> high above us, rising into a mere ridge, ser∣rated, or rather <HI>herissee,</HI> its whole length. The face of many of the rocks were marked with large veins of coarse white crystal; and others, especially <HI>Crib Coch,</HI> were varied with the deep green of the dwarf <HI>Alpine</HI> juniper. On attaining the top of the hills, above the lower end of the lake, we descend to the <HI>Gorphwysfa,</HI> where we found our horses, and returned once more into <HI>Nant-Gwinan.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the most beautiful vale in <HI>Snowdonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NANT GWYNAR</NOTE> varied with woods, lakes, river, and meadows; besides the most august

boundaries: being guarded on each side by vast mountains, such as <HI>Crib Du,</HI> or part of <HI>Mynydd Nanmer,</HI> the <HI>Aran, Lliwedd, Dduallt,</HI> and <HI>Wenallt,</HI> extending about five miles to the church of <HI>Beddkelert.</HI> On the left, we passed by <HI>Havod Lwyvog,</HI> the seat of the late <HI>Meyric Meredydd,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> surrounded with large woods. A little farther is the pretty lake <HI>Llyn Gwynan,</HI> about three quarters of a mile long, and near it are the ruins of a chapel of the same name. The chapel had been an ease to the church of <HI>Beddkelert,</HI> and was supported by a stipend of five pounds a year from the estate of <HI>Gwedir.</HI> It is said to have been founded by <HI>John Williams,</HI> grandson of <HI>John Coetmor, ap Meredydd, ap Je∣van, ap Robert,</HI> of <HI>Keselgyfarch</HI> and <HI>Gwedir,</HI> and goldsmith in <HI>London;</HI> the same who is reported to have furnished <HI>Michael Drayton</HI> with <HI>Leland</HI>'s papers.</P>
<P>NEAR the end of the lake, the valley grows so contracted, as to form only a narrow streight; but almost instantly opens again into a fine expanse, chiefly filled with the beautiful <HI>Llyn Di∣nas.</HI> Beyond that, is a tract of meads, chequered with woods, and watered by the river created by the various lakes; but re∣tains the name of <HI>Avon Glás-Lyn,</HI> from the lofty <HI>Ffynnon-Lâs,</HI> from which it originates.</P>
<P>AT the bottom rises a vast rock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DINAS EMRIS.</NOTE> insulated, and cloathed with wood; the famous <HI>Dinas Emris,</HI> from early times celebrated in <HI>British</HI> story; for here

<P><PB N="175" REF="189"/>WHEN <HI>Vortigern</HI> found himself unable to contest with the treacherous <HI>Saxons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS LEGEND.</NOTE> whom he had, in the year 449, invited into <HI>Britain,</HI> he determined, by the advice of his magicians, on build∣ing an impregnable fortress in <HI>Snowdon.</HI> He collected the ma∣terials, which all disappeared in one night. The prince, asto∣nished at this, convened again his wise men. They assured him, his building would never stand, unless it was sprinkled with the blood of a child born without the help of a father. The realm was ransacked: at length, one of his emissaries overheard some boys at play reproach another, and call him an unbegotten knave. The child and his mother were brought before the king. She confessed he was the offspring of an <HI>Incubus;</HI> a species of being, now unhappily out of all credit. The boy, whose name was <HI>Merlin,</HI> was ordered to be sacrificed; but on confounding all the magicians with his questions, and explaining the cause of the miscarriage, got his liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nennius,</HI> c. xl. xlii. xliii.</NOTE>, and

His mother, a <HI>Vestal,</HI> to save her life and honor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel</HI>'s Notes on <HI>Giraldus Itin. Cambriae,</HI> lib.

The vulgar, as usual, ascribed all he did to art ma∣gic; and his discovery that <HI>Vortigern</HI> had begun to found his castle on a morass, was immediately said to have been attended with most portentous circumstances. Numbers of prophecies were attributed to him; the repetition of which is said to have been forbidden by the council of <HI>Trent.</HI></P>
<P>THREE sides of this famous rock are precipitous. On the top is a large area; on the accessible part of which are two great ramparts of stone, and within is the ruin of a stone building, ten yards long: the walls are dry, but strong. Since it is certain that <HI>Vortigern,</HI> after his misfortunes, retired to the <HI>Snowdon</HI> hills, and died not very remote from them, it is possible he might have selected this for his strong-hold, as it is admirably adapted for that purpose, and nearly fills the streight of the valley, and <HI>Merlin Ambrosius</HI> might have given to it the name of <HI>Emris.</HI> A place close by, styled <HI>Cell y Dewiniaid,</HI> or <HI>The Cell of the</HI> DIVINERS, allusive to the magicians of <HI>Vortigern</HI>'s court, is ano∣ther circumstance which favors the history of this celebrated supposed prophet.</P>
<P>FROM hence is a pleasant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEED KELERT.</NOTE> but short ride, near the river, to the village of <HI>Bedd Kelert,</HI> seated in a beautiful tract of meadows, at

<PB N="177" REF="192"/>the junction of three vales, near the conflux of the <HI>Glâs Lyn</HI> and the <HI>Colwyn,</HI> which flows through <HI>Nant Colwyn,</HI> a vale that leads to <HI>Caernarvon.</HI> Its situation was the fittest in the world to in∣spire religious meditation, amidst lofty mountains, woods, and murmuring streams. The church is small, yet the loftiest in <HI>Snowdonia.</HI> The east window consists of three narrow slips. The roof is neat; and there yet remains some very pretty fret∣work. A side chapel is supported by two neat pillars, and gothic arches. I could discover no tombs, nor any thing worth transcribing, but the following epitaph:

<P>THIS church had been conventual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY.</NOTE> belonging to a priory of <HI>Augustines,</HI> dedicated to <HI>St. Mary.</HI> There is reason to suppose they might have been of that class which was called <HI>Gilbertines,</HI> and consisted of both men and women, who lived under the same roof, but strictly separated from each other by a wall. The cause of my suspicion is, that I discovered a piece of ground near the church, called <HI>Dôol y Llein,</HI> or <HI>The Meadow of the Nun.</HI></P>
<P>BEDD KELERT had been the most antient foundation in all the country, excepting <HI>Bardsey. Tanner</HI> ascribes it to our last prince; but it must have been long before his days, there being a recital
<PB N="178" REF="193"/>
of a charter for certain lands bestowed on it by <HI>Llewelyn the Great,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> ii. 316.</NOTE>, who began his reign in 1194. It was favored in the same manner by others of the succeeding princes. <HI>David ap Llewelyn</HI> bestowed on it some lands in <HI>Pennant Gwernogan,</HI> be∣longing to <HI>Tudor ap Madoc,</HI> to which the prince had no right. This occasioned a suit between the sons of <HI>Tudor,</HI> and <HI>Philip,</HI> prior of the house, before <HI>William de Grandison</HI> and <HI>R. de Stanedon,</HI> at <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> when a verdict was given against the convent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> MS.</NOTE>.

The esteem which these insects were held in by the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> on account of their pro∣ducing the nectareous <HI>Medd,</HI> was so great, that they considered them as created in PARADISE; that when they quitted it on the fall of man, they were blessed by God himself; and therefore, no mass ought to be celebrated, but by the light of their wax<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leges Walliae,</HI> 254.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prior had besides, an allowance of fifty cows and twent-two sheep. The expences of the house must have been large. It lay on the great road from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>West Wales</HI> into <HI>North Wales,</HI> and from <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>North Wales</HI> into <HI>England.</HI> In order to enable this place to keep its usual hospitality, after it had suffered, in 1283, by a casual fire, <HI>Edward</HI> I. most mu∣nificently repaired all the damages; and bishop <HI>Anian,</HI> about the year 1286, for the encouragement of other benefactors, re∣mitted

to all such who were truly repentant of their sins, forty days of any penance inflicted on them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> ii, 317.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1535, it was bestowed, by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. on the abby of <HI>Chertsey,</HI> in <HI>Surry;</HI> and in 1537, it was given with the last, as an appertenance to that of <HI>Bisham,</HI> in <HI>Berkshire</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Monast.</HI> iii. 21.</NOTE>. On the dissolu∣lution, the king gave to the family of the <HI>Bodvels,</HI> all the lands in <HI>Caernarvonshire</HI> which belonged to this priory; and all those in <HI>Anglesey,</HI> to that of the <HI>Prydderchs,</HI> excepting the township of Tre'rbeirdd.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rowland's MSS.</NOTE>.

There are not the lest reliques of the house.</P>
<P>IN order to complete the mountain ramble, as far as was in my power, I made an excursion from this village up a narrow vale. Ascend a steep road, amidst a thin hanging wood; and see from the road multitudes of black cattle, desending from all parts, on their way to a neighboring fair. The vale expands; is watered by the <HI>Colwyn,</HI> which flows from a small lake we passed by, called <HI>Llyn Cader.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN CADER.</NOTE> Left on the right another ascent to the <HI>Wyddfa,</HI> where its base extends to a considerable breadth, and is far less steep than that on the side of <HI>Nant-Beris.</HI> We soon reached the pretty lake of Cawellyn, noted for its Char. The mountains hereabouts approach near to each other. On the right, <HI>Mynydd Mawr</HI> forms a striking feature: its top is smooth, but its front is formed into a most immense precipice, retiring
<PB N="180" REF="195"/>
inwards in a semicircular shape. <HI>Moel Eilio,</HI> is another mountain of a stupendous bulk, most regularly rounded, and of a beautiful verdure. At <HI>Bettus Garmon,</HI> a village with a church dedicated to <HI>St. Germanus,</HI> the scene changes into a range of beautiful meadows, watered by a rapid stream.</P>
<P>I HERE turn my back on the humble flats, and resume my former road, till I had passed <HI>Cawellyn.</HI> Not far beyond that lake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN Y DYWARCHEN.</NOTE> I turned to the right, to visit <HI>Llyn y Dywarchen,</HI> or <HI>The Lake of the Sod,</HI> long since celebrated by the hyperbolical pen of <HI>Giraldus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Itin. Cambr.</HI> lib. ii. c. ix. p. 871.</NOTE>, for its <HI>insula erratica,</HI> its <HI>wandering island,</HI> as he calls it. That little lake is seated in the middle of a turbery; and at this time actually exhibited the phaenomenon recorded by our romantic historian. It had on it a floating island, of an irregu∣lar shape, and about nine yards long. It appeared to be only a piece of the turbery, undermined by the water, torn off, and kept together by the close entangling of the roots, which form that species of ground. It frequently is set in motion by the wind; often joins its native banks; and, as <HI>Giraldus</HI> says, cattle are frequently surprized on it, and by another gale carried a short voyage from the shore.</P>
<P>CONTINUE our journey to <HI>Drws y Coed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DRWS Y COED.</NOTE> or <HI>The Door of the Wood,</HI> a pass towards <HI>Clynnog.</HI> It is bounded by vast moun∣tains: on one side by <HI>Tal Mignedd;</HI> on the other, by a great clift of <HI>Mynydd Mawr.</HI> Some years ago, here were con∣siderable adventures for copper, of the yellow kind; and in the rocks were sometimes found some very thin <HI>laminae</HI> of the native
<PB N="181" REF="196"/>
metal. I was tempted here to exceed a little the limits of my <HI>Alpine</HI> tour; for now the mountains descend fast from their ma∣jestic heights, growing less and less as they approach the <HI>Irish</HI> sea. My motive was to obtain a sight of two fine lakes, called <HI>Llynnieu Nanlle,</HI> which form two handsome expanses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYNIEU NANLLE.</NOTE> with a very small distance between each. From hence is a noble view of the <HI>Wyddfa,</HI> which terminates the view through the visto of <HI>Drws y Coed.</HI> It is from this spot Mr. WILSON has favored us with a view, as magnificent as it is faithful. Few are sensible of this; for few visit the spot.</P>
<P>NEAR these lakes <HI>Edward</HI> I. in the summer of 1284, resided for some days; and from hence issued out more than one of his edicts. I find some dated <HI>July</HI> the 17th and the 20th. Others are dated in the same year, from <HI>Bangor, Caernarvon, Mold,</HI> and <HI>Hope.</HI> One from <HI>Caernarvon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> MSS. <HI>Rymer,</HI> ii. 276 to 289.</NOTE> is dated as late as the 22d of <HI>October;</HI> which shews what attention he paid to the establishment of government in his new dominions, by the long visit he deigned to honor them with. The place he resided at here, was called <HI>Bala Deu Llyn,</HI> or the place where a river discharges itself from two lakes: but at present all memory is lost of the situation of the town, whose traces might perhaps be still discovered, after proper search.</P>
<P>I RETURNED by the same road; and again reach <HI>Bedd Ke∣lert,</HI> where I made a coarse lodging. The evening was so fine, that we were irresistibly tempted not to defer till morning our visit to <HI>Pont Aberglas Llyn,</HI> a short walk from hence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PONT ABERGLAS LLYN.</NOTE> The first part is along the narrow vale; but in a very little time
<PB N="182" REF="197"/>
the mountains approach so close, as to leave only room for the furious river to roll over its stony bed; above which is a narrow road, formed with incredible labor, impending over the water. The way seems to have been first cut out of the rock, and then covered with great stones, as usual in several of our narrow passes. The scenery is the most magnificent that can be ima∣gined. The mountains rise to very uncommon height, and op∣pose to us nothing but a broken series of precipices, one above the other, as high as the eye can reach. Here is very little ap∣pearance of vegetation; yet in spots there is here and there enough to tempt the poor goat to its destruction; for it will sometimes leap down to an alluring tuft of verdure, where, with∣out possiblity of return, it must remain to perish, after it has fi∣nished the dear-bought repast.</P>
<P>THE bridge terminates the pass; and consists of a single arch, flung over a deep chasm, from rock to rock. Above is a considerable cataract, where the traveller at times may have much amusement, in observing the salmon, in great numbers, make their efforts to surpass the heights. Near the place is a salmon fishery. Here had been a royal wear in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. which was then rented by <HI>Robert ap Meredydd.</HI> It probably be∣longed in old times to our natural princes; for it seems to have been a most valuable privelege. We have seen before, that young <HI>Elphin</HI> was endowed with one by his royal father; and the effect of his disappointment in missing his usual revenues, by finding (which, I dare say, was in those days a very rare in∣stance) an empty wear. Salmon was the most useful and esteemed fish among the <HI>Welsh:</HI> it was reckoned among the game; and, if I remember right, is the only species which was preserved by law.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="198"/>ON my return to <HI>Bedd Kelert,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RHYS GOCH.</NOTE> a stone by the road side was pointed out to me, by the name of the chair of <HI>Rhys Goch O'ryri,</HI> the famous mountain bard, cotemporary with <HI>Owen Glyndwr.</HI> He was of the house of <HI>Havod Garregog</HI> at the entrance into <HI>Traeth Mawr,</HI> from whence he used to walk, and sitting on this stone, compose his poems. Among others, is a satire on a fox, for killing his favorite peacock. He died about the year 1420, and was interred in the holy ground at <HI>Bedd Kelert,</HI> after escaping the vengeance of the <HI>English,</HI> for inspiring our countrymen with the love of liberty, and animating them, by his compositions, into a long and gallant resistance to the galling yoke.</P>

<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF THE JOURNEY.</HEAD>

It may please you to understand my first undertaking of publick works was amongst my owne, within less than a myle of the place where I hadd my first beinge, 24 or 25 years since, in seekinge of coales for the town of <HI>Denbigh.</HI></P>
<P>TOUCHINGE the drowned lands near your lyvinge, there are manye things considerable therein. Iff to be gayned, which will hardlie be performed without great stones, which was plentifull at the <HI>Weight,</HI> as well as wood; and great sums of money to be spent, not hundreds but thousands— and first of all his Majesty's interest must be got. As for

myself, I am grown into years, and full of busines here at the mynes, the river at <HI>London,</HI> and other places—my weeklie charge being above £200; which maketh me verie unwillinge to undertake anie other worke; and the least of theis, whether the drowned lands or mynes, requireth a whole man, with a large purse.—Noble Sir, my desire is great to see you, which should draw me a farr longer waie; yet such are my occasions at this tyme here, for the settlinge of this great worke, that I can hardlie be spared one howre in a daie. My wieff being also here, I cannot leave her in a strange place. Yet my love to publique works, and desire to see you (if God permit) maie another tyme drawe me into those parts. Soe with my heartie comendations I comitt you and all your good desires to God,</P>

<P><NOTE>VIEW FROM THE SANDS.</NOTE>THE view from the middle of the sands towards <HI>Snowdonia,</HI> is most extravagantly wild. Mountain rises above mountain, exposing the most savage and barren aspect imaginable, naked, precipitous, and craggy. The <HI>Cyfnicht</HI> soars into a picturesque rocky cone; and <HI>Y Wyddfa</HI> rises in the back-ground pre-emi∣nent among its companions.</P>
<P>ON quitting the sands, arrive in a tract of meadows, sprinkled with insulated rocks rising in various places, and embosomed with woods, rocks, and precipices. On the road observed some poor iron ore, and groups of coarse crystals, the reliques of an unprofitable mine-adventure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PENMORVA.</NOTE> The small town of <HI>Pen∣morva</HI> lies at the head of these meadows. The church is dedi∣cated
<PB N="188" REF="203"/>
cated to <HI>St. Beuno,</HI> and annexed to it is the chapel of <HI>Dolben∣maen.</HI> Here was interred that valiant knight Sir <HI>John Owen.</HI> Besides his monument, is another small one to Sir <HI>William Morris</HI> of <HI>Clenenney,</HI> who died <HI>August</HI> 11th 1622.</P>
<P>IN former times this neighborhood abounded with gentry. It lies in the hundred of <HI>Evionydd,</HI> in remote days possessed by two clans; one descended from <HI>Owen Gwynedd,</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and consisted of four houses, <HI>Cessail Gyfarch, Ystym-cegid, Clenenney, Brynker, Glasfryn,</HI> or <HI>Cwmstrallyn;</HI> the other was de∣rived from <HI>Collwyn ap Tangno,</HI> and consisted of the houses of <HI>Whilog, Bron y Foel, Berkin, Gwynfryn, Tal Hén Bont</HI> (now <HI>Plas Hén</HI>), and <HI>Pennardd.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gwedir</HI> family, in <HI>Mr. Barrington's Miscell,</HI> octavo, 143.</NOTE> My curiosity once led me to make a tour of a few miles from hence to visit these antient mansions. In the days I allude to, the feuds among the gentry filled the land with blood. The history of our country, during that period, is the history of revenge, perfidy, and slaughter. This consideration induced <HI>Meredydd ap Jevan,</HI> ancestor of the <HI>Wynnes</HI> of <HI>Gwedir</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> ii. 137.</NOTE>, to quit this his paternal country. "I had rather," says he, <Q>fight with outlaws and thieves, than with my own blood and kindred. If I live in my own house in <HI>Evionydd,</HI> I must either kill my own kinsmen, or be killed by them.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was not a house in the hundred but had its dreadful tale. They would quarrel, if it was but for 'the mastery of the country, and the first <HI>good morrow</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gwedir family.</NOTE>!' <HI>John Owen ap John ap Mereddyd</HI> and <HI>Howel ap Madoc Vychan,</HI> fell out for no other reason. <HI>Howel</HI> and his people fought valiantly. When he fell, his
<PB N="189" REF="204"/>
mother placed her hand on his head, to prevent the fatal blow, and had half her hand and three of her fingers cut off by some of her nearest kindred. An attempt was made to kill <HI>Howel ap Rhys</HI> in his own house, by the sons of <HI>John ap Mereddyd,</HI> for no other reason but that their servants had quarrelled about a fishery.</P>
<P><NOTE>ANTIQUETIES.</NOTE> THEY first set fire to the mansion with great bundles of straw. The besieged, terrified With the flames, sheltered themselves under forms and benches; while <HI>Rhys,</HI> the old hero, stood sword in hand, reproaching his men with cowardice, and telling them <HI>be bad often seen a greater smoke in that hall on a Christmas even.</HI> These flagitious deeds seldom met with any other punishment than what resulted from private revenge; and too often composi∣tion was made for the most horrible murders. There was a <HI>Gwerth,</HI> or <HI>price of blood,</HI> from the slaughter of a king to the cutting off of one of his subject's little fingers.</P>
<P>SEVERAL antiquities are scattered over this part of the county. Near <HI>Dolbenmaen</HI> is a large mount, on which might have been, as Mr. <HI>Rowland</HI> conjectures, a watch-tower. Near <HI>Ystym∣kiged</HI> are three <HI>Cromlehs</HI> joining to each other, possibly me∣morial of three chieftains slain on the spot. And near <HI>Clenen∣ney,</HI> on <HI>Bwlch Craigwen,</HI> is a fine druidical circle, consisting at present of thirty-eight stones: at a mile's distance, and within sight of this, above <HI>Penmorva,</HI> is another. Before I returned, I visited <HI>Brynkir,</HI> in my memory inhabited by a family of the same name. It lies beneath the great mountain <HI>Hedog,</HI> which, divides this country from the vale of <HI>Bedd Kelert.</HI> From hence the country gradually lowers to the extremity of the county.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="205"/>DURING my stay at <HI>Penmorva,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DWARFS.</NOTE> I was desired to observe <HI>Dick Bach,</HI> a diminutive person, who casually called there. He was servant to a neighboring gentleman, about the age of thirty, and only three feet eleven inches high. He was pointed out to me only for the sake of describing his sister, <HI>Mary Bach o Cwmmain,</HI> or, little <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Cwmmain;</HI> a well-proportioned fairy, of the height of three feet four. Her virtues are superior to her size: she brews, bakes, pickles; in short, does every thing that the best housekeeper can do. Their parents live in these parts, have many children of the common stature of man; but nature chose to sport in the formation of this little pair.</P>
<P>IN the winter of 1694,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A MEPHITIC VA∣POUR.</NOTE> this neighborhood was remarkable for an amazing and noxious phaenomenon. A <HI>mephites,</HI> or pesti∣lential vapour, resembling a weak blue slame, arose, during a fortnight or three weeks, out of a sandy marshy tract, called <HI>Morva Bychan</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> ii. 788. <HI>Ph. Trans.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 208. <HI>Lowthorp's Abridg.</HI> ii. 183.</NOTE>, and crossed over a channel of eight miles to <HI>Harlech.</HI> It set fire on that side to sixteen ricks of hay and two barns, one filled with hay, the other with corn. It infected the grass in such a manner, that numbers of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats, died. One character of a <HI>mephites</HI> was wanting; for men went into the midst of it with impunity. It was easily dispelled; any great noise, such as the sounding of horns, the discharging of guns, or the like, at once repelled it. It moved only by night; and appeared at times, but less frequently, the following summer; after which this phaenomenon ceased. It may possibly arise, as the editor of <HI>Cambden</HI> conjectures, from a local
<PB N="191" REF="206"/>
casualty, such as the fall of a flight of Locusts in that spot, as really did in the sea near <HI>Aberdaron;</HI> which growing corrupt, might, by the blowing of the wind for a certain period from one point, direct the pest to a certain spot, while others less remote might, for the same reason, escape the dreadful effects. <HI>Mouffet</HI> gives an account of a plague in <HI>Lombardy,</HI> about the year 591, which arose from the fall of a cloud of Locusts, which corrupted the air to such a degree, that eighty thousand men and cattle perished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Theatre of Infects, <HI>Engl. ed.</HI> 986.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I continued my journey along the shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WRECK OF BIRDS.</NOTE> which is for the most part flat, except where some small headland juts into it. On this coast the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hugh Davies,</HI> of <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> was witness to a very uncommon wreck of sea-fowl, which had happ∣ened in 1776. He saw the beach, for miles together, co∣vered with dead birds, especially those kinds which annually visit the rocks in summer; such as Puffins, Razor-bills, Guil∣lemots, and Kittiwakes; of the last. there were many many thou∣sands. Numbers also of Tarrocks. And of birds which retire to distant countries to breed, were Gannets, Wild-geese, Bernacles, Brent-geese, Scoters, and Tufted-ducks. The frost, from <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> 6th to <HI>February</HI> the 2d, had been in that winter uncom∣monly severe: a storm had probably overtaken both the mi∣grants and re-migrants, and occasioned this havock; and the birds, which are perpetually resident with us, underwent the same fate, unable to resist the freezing gale.</P>

<P><PB N="192" REF="208"/>Its castle is seated on a pretty round hill, jutting far into the sea, and the isthmus crossed, by way of defence, by two deep ditches; on each side of the entrance is a great round tower. The court is of an irregular form, and has the remains of a square tower; beyond is another court, and in it, on the verge of the rock, are two others, also square. It is probable that all the towers were originally square, for the insides of the two round towers are of that form. They have so much the appearance of the architecture of <HI>Dolwyddelan</HI> castle, that I entertain no doubt but that this castle was founded by a <HI>Welsh</HI> prince, and that its supposed founder <HI>Edward</HI> I. did no more than case the towers, which at present are the two rounders. After the Con∣quest, <HI>Edward</HI> appointed <HI>William de Leybourn</HI> to be constable, with a salary of a hundred pounds a year; for which he was to maintain a garrison of thirty stout men (ten of whom were to be cross-bow men) one chaplain, one surgeon, one carpenter, and one mason<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OUR boasted countryman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR HOWEL Y FWYALL.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Howel y Fwyall,</HI> was con∣stable of this castle; a hero descended from <HI>Collwyn ap Tangno.</HI> He attended the Black Prince to the battle of <HI>Poitiers,</HI> and, as we say, was the person who took the <HI>French</HI> king prisoner; but history bestows that honor on <HI>Denis de Morebeque,</HI> a knight of <HI>Artois</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Froissart,</HI> tom. i. ch. clxiiii. p. 195. <HI>Engl. Froissart,</HI> i.</NOTE>. Perhaps we must wave that particular glory; but he undoubtedly behaved on the occasion with distinguished valour: for the Black Prince not only bestowed on him the constableship of this castle, which he afterwards made his residence, but
<PB N="193" REF="209"/>
knighted him, and, in perpetual memorial of his good services, ordered that from thenceforth a mess of meat should be served up before the pole-ax with which he performed such great feats; for what reason he bore it in his coat of arms, and was slyled Sir <HI>Howel y Fwyall,</HI> or of the <HI>Ax:</HI> after the mess had appeared before the knight, it was carried down and bestowed on the poor. Eight yeomen attendants were constituted to guard the mess, and had eight pence a day constant wages, at the king's charge; and these, under the name of yeomen of the crown, were continued on the establishment till the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> Some do not scruple to say, that the yeo∣men of the crown were grafted upon this stock. After the death of Sir <HI>Howel,</HI> the mess was carried as before, and bestowed on the poor, for the sake of his soul; and probably as low as the period above mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>XV Tribes of North Wales;</HI> and <HI>Hist, Gwedir Family</HI> in <HI>Mr, Barrington's Miscelles;</HI> and <HI>Hist.

<P>EIGHT miles farther is <HI>Pwllheli.</HI> In my way cross over a pretty stream, on a bridge of three arches, at <HI>Llan Ystyndwy,</HI> a church and village in a pretty wooded bottom. A little farther inland is <HI>Plâs Hén,</HI> a seat <HI>of Evan Lloyd Vaughan,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by marriage of an heiress of the name of <HI>Vaughan,</HI> a descendant of <HI>Colwyn ap Tangno:</HI> she afterwards married <HI>William Lloyd,</HI> a younger son of <HI>Bod-idris.</HI> Cross the little river <HI>Arch,</HI> at <HI>Aber-arch,</HI> or the port of the coffin, near a church dedicated to St. <HI>Cwrda.</HI> After another mile's ride reach <HI>Pwllheli,</HI> the best town in this country, and the magazine of goods which supplies all this tract. It lies close on the shore, and has a tolerable harbour for vessels of about sixty tons. The en∣trance
<PB N="194" REF="210"/>
is by a high rock called <HI>The Gimlet,</HI> a mile from land, to which it is joined by a range of sand-hills. This place was made a free borough by the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> by charter, dated in the 12th year of his principality, at <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> in compliment, to <HI>Nigel de Loryng</HI> or <HI>Lohareyn,</HI> one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber, on whom he had bestowed <HI>Pwllheli</HI> and <HI>Nevyn,</HI> in consideration of his great service in <HI>Gascony,</HI> and particularly at the battle of <HI>Poitiers.</HI> He entitles him to <HI>Servitiis quorum∣cunque tenentium tam liberorum quam nativorum;</HI> by which it may be presumed that he did not include the <HI>Welsh</HI> in the privileges. What those were I do not learn; but they were the same which the burgesses of <HI>Rosfair</HI> in <HI>Anglesey</HI> enjoyed: and for them <HI>Pwll∣heli</HI> was to pay to <HI>Nigel</HI> fourteen pounds a year, and <HI>Nevyn</HI> thirty∣two. This borough and <HI>Nevyn</HI> he freely bestowed on him, with all its appurtenances, together with four librates of land, to∣wards the repair of his manors; and for all these he was only to pay an acknowlegement of a rose, in lieu of all services. If he died without issue, the whole was to revert to the crown. <HI>Edward</HI> III. afterwards confirmed these grants at <HI>Sandwich.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence I took a ride about five miles inland to <HI>Carn Madryn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CARN MADRYN.</NOTE> a lofty rocky insulated hill, noted for having been a strong hold of the sons of <HI>Owen Gwynedd, Roderick</HI> and <HI>Mal∣gwn,</HI> to whom this part of the country belonged. The bottom, sides, and top, are filled with cells, oblong, oval, or circular, once thatched, or covered from the inclemency of the weather: many of them are pretty entire. The chieftains resided on the top; the country, with the cattle, in times of invasion, occu∣pied the sides and bottom. The whole summit was surrounded with a wall, still visible in many places. From the summit is
<PB N="195" REF="211"/>
an extensive view of the country, with the bay of <HI>Caerncr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> on one side, and that of <HI>Cardigan</HI> on the other. <HI>Sarn Badrig</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> ii 212.</NOTE> is seen extending from <HI>Meireonyddshire</HI> its dangerous length, nearly parallel to the shore of <HI>Lhein. South Wales</HI> may be seen plainly, and in clear weather <HI>Ireland;</HI> and in front the whole tract of <HI>Snowdonia</HI> exhibits a most magnificent and stupendous barrier.</P>
<P>AT the foot of this hill is <HI>Madryn,</HI> formerly the seat of the <HI>Bodvels,</HI> descended from <HI>Collwyn ap Tangno;</HI> but on the death of the last male heir the estate was purchased by — <HI>Parry,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Wern Vawr.</HI> From <HI>Pwllheli</HI> I continued my journey near the shore to <HI>Llan Badrog,</HI> along the sides of that noble bay the <HI>Tudwal</HI>'s road, sheltered by two islands of that name, so named from St. <HI>Tudwal;</HI> sacred to whom was a small chapel on the greater. Its present inhabitants are sheep, rabbits, and, in the season, puffins.</P>
<P>IN the promontory <HI>Penrhyn Du,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PENRHYN DU.</NOTE> one of the points of this bay, have been considerable adventures for lead ore; and of late years attempts to drain the mines, by means of a fire engine: but the expences proved superior to the profits. A little be∣yond this is another bay, called <HI>Hell's Mouth,</HI> dreaded by mari∣ners, being the <HI>Scylla</HI> to the <HI>Charybdis</HI> of <HI>Sarn Badrig,</HI> whose extremity lies nearly opposite.</P>
<P>IN a small time I reached <HI>Aber-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aron,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ABER-DARON.</NOTE> a poor village, at the very end of <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> seated on a sandy bay, beneath some high and sandy cliffs. The mouth of the bay is guarded by two little islands, called <HI>Ynys Gwylan,</HI> a security to the small craft of the inhabitants, who are all fishermen. It takes its
<PB N="196" REF="212"/>
name from the small rivulet the <HI>Daron,</HI> which empties itself here.</P>
<P>IN the church are two ailes, supported by four very handsome pillars. This being the place where devotees usually took boat for <HI>Bardseye</HI> island, was greatly resorted to. It was dedicated to St. <HI>Hywyn,</HI> a saint of that island: was a sanctuary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 176.</NOTE>, and also much frequented by pilgrims. <HI>Leland says,</HI> it was called <HI>Llan Engas Brenin, Fanum Niniani Reguli</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Itin.</HI> v. 51. <HI>Ninian</HI> died in 432.</NOTE>. <HI>Ninian</HI> is a saint, son of a <HI>Cumbrian</HI> prince, and whom legend might have sent here to found the church.</P>
<P>FROM this port I once took boat for <HI>Bardseye</HI> island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BARADSEYE ISLAND.</NOTE> which lies about three leagues to the west. The mariners seemed tinctured with the piety of the place; for they had not rowed far, but they made a full stop, pulled off their hats, and offered up a short prayer. After doubling a headland, the island ap∣pears full in view: we passed under the lofty mountain which forms one side. After doubling the farther end, we put into a little sandy creek, bounded by low rocks, as is the whole level part. On landing, I found all this tract a very fertile plain, and well cultivated, and productive of every thing which the main land affords. The abbot's house is a large stone build∣ing, inhabited by several of the natives: not far from it is a singular chapel, or oratory, being a long arched edifice, with an insulated stone altar near the east end. In this place one of the inhabitants reads prayers: all other offices are performed at <HI>Aber-daron.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="213"/>THE island is about two miles in circumference, contains a few inhabitants, and is rented from Lord <HI>Newborough.</HI> It was granted by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. to his uncle Sir <HI>Thomas Seymour,</HI> and after his death to <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 703.</NOTE>. The late Sir <HI>John Wynn</HI> purchased it from the late reverend Dr. <HI>Wilson</HI> of <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>THE island, whose spiritual concerns are at present under the care of a single rustic, once afforded, during life, an asylum to 20,000 saints; and after death, graves to as many of their bodies: well therefore might it be called <HI>Insula Sanctorum, The Isie of Saints.</HI> But, with Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> I must observe, that <Q>it would be more facile to find graves in <HI>Bardseye</HI> for so many saints, than saints for so many graves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Worthies of Wales, <HI>29.</HI></NOTE>,</Q> But to approach the truth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. DUBRITIUS</NOTE> let it be said, that <HI>Dubritius,</HI> archbishop of <HI>Caer-leon,</HI> almost worn out with age, resigning his see to St. <HI>David,</HI> re∣tired here, and, according to the best account, died in 612; was interred on the spot; but in after times his body was re∣moved to <HI>Llandaff.</HI> The slaughter of the monks of <HI>Bangor,</HI> about the year 607, is supposed to have contributed to the population of this island; for not only the brethren who es∣caped, but numbers of other pious <HI>Britons,</HI> fled hither to avoid the rage of the <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>THE time in which the religious house was founded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONVENT.</NOTE> is very uncertain; it probably was before the retreat of <HI>Dubritius;</HI> for something of that kind must have occasioned him to give the preference to this place. It seems likely to have been a seat of the <HI>Culdees,</HI> or <HI>Colidei,</HI> the first religious recluses of <HI>Great
<PB N="198" REF="214"/>
Britain;</HI> who sought islands and desert places in which they might in security worship the true GOD. It was certainly re∣sorted to in very early times; for our accounts say, that it flourished as a convent in the days of <HI>Cadwan</HI> king of <HI>Britain,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rowlands,</HI> 137.</NOTE>, coeval with <HI>Dubritius.</HI> It was an abbey dedicated to St. <HI>Mary.</HI> I find among the <HI>Sebright</HI> MSS. mention of a petition from the abbot to <HI>Edward</HI> II. in which he sets forth the injuries he had received from the sheriff of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> who had extorted from him 68s. and 6d. contrary to his deed of feoffment: on which the king directed <HI>Roger de Mortimer,</HI> justiciary of <HI>Wales,</HI> to make enquiry into the matter; who reported, that the abbot held his lands in the county of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> in <HI>puram et perpe∣tuam elemosynam,</HI> without any service or secular acknowlegement; and further, that <HI>David,</HI> lord of <HI>Lhein,</HI> and brother to the last Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> had exacted the same sum; as did his <HI>Pen∣cynydd,</HI> or master of his dogs, possibly under pretence of maintaining them. The king therefore, by his special favor, and by advice of his council, does for ever remit the said sum, and all arrears; and directs that no one in future, either on his account, or that of his heirs, ever should molest the convent.</P>
<P>THE house underwent the common fate of others at the dis∣solution. Its revenues were, as <HI>Dugdale</HI> says, 46<HI>l.</HI> 1<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> according to <HI>Speed,</HI> 58<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> In the year 1553, only 1<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> remained in charge to the surviving religious of this place.</P>
<P>THE <HI>British</HI> name of the island is <HI>Ynys Enlli,</HI> or the Island in the Current, from the fierce current which rages particu∣larly
<PB N="199" REF="215"/>
between it and the main land. The <HI>Saxons</HI> named it <HI>Bardseye,</HI> probably from the bards who retire here, preferring solitude to the company of invading foreigners.</P>
<P>THERE are great plenty of fish round the island, and abun∣dance of lobsters: the spiny lobster, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iv. N<SUP>o</SUP> 22. is more frequent here than in most other places.</P>
<P>WE re-embarked from the rocks on the opposite side of the island to that on which we landed. Rowed through the rapid current called the <HI>Race of Bardsey,</HI> between the island and the great promontory <HI>Braech y Pwll,</HI> the <HI>Canganum Promontorium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy:</HI> part of it is called, from certain yellow stones, <HI>Maem Melyn;</HI> the rest is a vast precipice, black and tremen∣dous. After landing at <HI>Aber-daron,</HI> I rid to its summit, and found the ruins of a small church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPEL VAIR.</NOTE> called <HI>Capel Vair,</HI> the Chapel of our Lady; and I was informed, that at the foot of the pro∣montory, below high-water mark, was a fountain of fresh water, to which devotees were wont to descend by a circuitous and most hazardous path, to get, at low-water, a mouthful of the spring; which if they carried up safe to the summit, their wish, whatsoever it was, was to be surely fulfilled. This was under the protection of our Lady, and called <HI>Ffynnon Vain.</HI> The chapel was placed here to give the seamen opportunity of invoking the tutelar saint for protection through this dangerous sound, and I dare say, in old times, the walls were covered with votive tables. Not far from hence I pasfed by the ruins of <HI>Capel Anhelog,</HI> or, the Chapel without Endowment.</P>
<P>AFTER going through a fertile bottom, ascended a lofty moun∣tain impending over the sea, called <HI>Uwch Mynydd;</HI> on which were several circular hollows, edged with stone, the tempo∣rary

<PB N="200" REF="217"/>habitations of perhaps some invader. Descend, and pass by a large and antient house, called <HI>Bethelem.</HI></P>
<P>NOT far from thence, about a quarter of a mile from the shore, rises a high rock, called <HI>Maen y Mellt,</HI> or, The Stone of Lightning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAEN Y MELLT.</NOTE> Ride by <HI>Cefn-amwlch,</HI> the seat of <HI>John Griffith,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and soon after to <HI>Brynodol,</HI> that of <HI>Hugh Griffith,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> where I met with a most hospitable reception for two nights. From hence I visited the neighboring shore, which is here low and rocky, opening into frequent little creeks, useful to the fishermen; who find in them, during the herring-fishery, a safe retreat from storms. Among these are, <HI>Porth Towyn, Porth Colman, Porth Gwylan,</HI> and <HI>Porth Ysgadan.</HI> Near the last, about thirty years ago, a rock, which towered a great height out of the sea, was suddenly missed, after a horrible night of thunder and lightning, supposed to have been struck down by the resistless bolt. I observed that the fields about <HI>Porth Gwylan</HI> were covered with <HI>y ddafad,</HI> or samphire, which sheep and cattle eagerly feed on, and grow very fat. I was pleased here with the fine blossom of thrift glowing over numbers of the pastures.</P>
<P>LLŶN or <HI>Lleyn</HI> is a very extensive hundred: in general flat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLŶN, PRODUCE OF.</NOTE> but interspersed with most characteristic hills or rocks, rising insulated in several parts: none makes so conspicuous a figure as <HI>Carn Madryn</HI> and <HI>Carn Boduon.</HI> The houses of the common people are very mean; made with clay, thatched, and destitute of chimnies. Notwithstanding the laudable example of the gentry, the country is in an unimproved state, neglected for the sake of the herring-fishery. The chief produce is oats, and black cattle. I was informed that above three thousand are
<PB N="201" REF="218"/>
annually sold out of these parts. Much oats, barley, butter, and cheese, are exported. The land is excellent for grazing, be∣ing watered by a thousand little rills. It is destitute of trees, except about the houses of the gentry.</P>
<P>THE herrings, about the year 1771, <NOTE PLACE="marg">HERRINGS.</NOTE> were taken here in vast abundance, from <HI>Porth Ysgadan,</HI> or the <HI>Port of Herrings,</HI> to <HI>Bard∣seye</HI> island. The capture amounted usually to the value of about four thousand pounds. They were sometimes salted on shore; at other times bought from the fishers by the <HI>Irish</HI> wherries at sea, and carried to be cured in <HI>Dublin.</HI> These desultory fish, about the period mentioned, appear in <HI>July</HI> and went away in <HI>October;</HI> in earlier times they came in <HI>September</HI> and went away in <HI>No∣vember. Dories</HI> are often taken here. The fishermen were wont to fling them away, on account of their ugly appearance: nor was this luxury known to the gentry, till one of their servants, who was acquainted with the fish, informed them of its being an inhabitant of thefe seas. The <HI>Atherine, Br. Zool.</HI> iii. No 157, is taken near <HI>Pwllbeli;</HI> and a small lobster is often found burrowing in the sand; but differs from the common kind only in its place of residence, and in size. The traps for lobsters are made with packthread, like thief-nets, and baited with pieces of the lesser spotted shark, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 47. The fishers remark, that the sexes of these voracious fish confort, at certain times, apart; for at certain periods they take only males, at others only females.</P>
<P>THE churches in this country are of very antient foundation. Some cause or other prevented me from seeing several old inscriptions; a few of which I have since picked up. In the church of <HI>Llangynodol</HI> is said to be this; <HI>Hic jacet</HI> GWEN HOEDL,
<PB N="202" REF="219"/>
a holy lady, who lived in very early times. DERVORI <HI>hic jacet,</HI> is another inscription, on a stone now placed over a door of <HI>Pen∣prys</HI> stable, in <HI>Llannor</HI> parish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>; and at <HI>Capel Yverach,</HI> in <HI>Aber∣daron</HI> parish, is another, which I think better expressed by an engraving<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE>. They are cut on very rude stones, and were cer∣tainly the work of the early times of Christianity.</P>
<P>BRYNODOL, by advantage of situation on the side of a hill, commands a vast view of a flat woodless tract, the sea, and a noble mass of mountains. The <HI>Eist</HI> hills, <HI>Boduon,</HI> and the vast <HI>Carn Madryn,</HI> rise in the fore ground; and beyond these soars all <HI>Snowdonia,</HI> from those <HI>alps</HI> which surround the <HI>Wyddfa,</HI> to the most remote in the county of <HI>Meireonydd.</HI></P>
<P>ON quitting <HI>Brynodol</HI> I descended into an extensive flat;<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTH YN LLŶN.</NOTE> reached <HI>Porth yn Llŷn,</HI> a fine safe and sandy bay, guarded on the west by a narrow headland, jutting far into the sea. On part of it are the remains of very strong entrenchments; pro∣bably an out-post of the <HI>Romans:</HI> who, as I shall have occasion to mention, had another between this place and <HI>Caernarvon.</HI></P>
<P>SEPARATED from this bay by a small headland, is that of <HI>Nefyn;</HI> and near it a small town of the same name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEFYN.</NOTE> a contribu∣tory borough to <HI>Caernarvon.</HI> This place had been bestowed on <HI>Nigel de Lohareyn</HI> by the Black Prince, in the 12th year of his principality, and made a free borough: was allowed a guild mercatory, with every privilege attendant on other free boroughs, and all the liberties and customs granted here∣tofore to that of <HI>Newborough</HI> in <HI>Anglesey.</HI> He also gave it a grant of two fairs annually, and a market on a <HI>Sunday;</HI> to

which the inhabitants of that part of the <HI>Commot y Llŷn,</HI> then called <HI>Dynthlayn,</HI> were obliged to resort.</P>
<P>HERE <HI>Edward</HI> I, in 1284, held his triumph on the conquest of <HI>Wales;</HI> and perhaps, to conciliate the affections of his new subjects, in imitation of our hero <HI>Arthur, held a round table, and celebrated it with dance and tournament</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ad rotundam tabulam juxta <HI>Snowdon</HI> praeonizatam in choreis et hastiludiis ad invicem colludentibus. <HI>Annal.

<P>THE custom is very antient; for it may be derived even higher than the days of <HI>Arthur.</HI> We may allow that he held his round table on account of one of his victories; and that he had four-and-twenty knights who sat at the festive board; which might have been designedly made of a circular form, in order to destroy all dispute about pre-eminence of seat. But the <HI>Gauls</HI> also sate at their round tables, and every knight had at his back a squire with his armour, in waiting<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Athenaeus,</HI> lib. iv.</NOTE>. This gallant assem∣bly was held for many ages after. Besides this held at <HI>Nefyn,</HI>

<P><NOTE>VORTIGERN's VALLEY,</NOTE>THE first, I apprehend to have been performed in those cir∣cular <HI>areae,</HI> which we still meet with in some parts of <HI>England,</HI> surrounded with a high mound, a ditch in the inside, and two entrances one opposite to the other, for the knights to enter at and make their onset. One of these I have seen by <HI>Penrith,</HI> which bears the name of <HI>Arthur</HI>'s round table<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Scotland,</HI> 1769, 3d ed.</NOTE>; others, which are far larger, I found on <HI>Thornborough</HI> heath, in <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> of which I may in future time give some account.</P>
<P>ASCEND from <HI>Nefyn</HI> for a considerable way up the side of the high hill; and after a short ride on level ground quit our horses, in order to visit <HI>Nant y Gwrtheyrn,</HI> or <HI>Vortigen's valley,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VORTIGERN'S VALLEY.</NOTE> the immense hollow, to which <HI>Vortigern</HI> is said to have fled from the rage of his subjects, and where it was said that he and his castle were consumed with lightning. <HI>Nennius</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Br.</HI> c. xlviii.</NOTE> places the scene near the <HI>Teivi,</HI> in <HI>Caermarthenshire;</HI> but I believe that the historian not only mistakes the spot, but even the man∣ner of his death. His life had been profligate; the monks therefore were determined that he should not die the common death of all men, and accordingly made him perish with signal marks of the vengeance of Heaven. Fancy cannot frame a place more fit for a retreat from the knowlege of mankind, or more apt to inspire one with full hopes of security from any pursuit. Embosomed in a lofty mountain, on two sides bounded by
<PB N="205" REF="222"/>
stony steeps, on which no vegetables appear but the blasted heath and stunted gorse; the third side exhibits a most tremen∣dous front of black precipice, with the loftiest peak of the mountain <HI>Eifl</HI> soaring above; and the only opening to this secluded spot is towards the sea, a northern aspect! where that chilling wind exerts all its fury, and half freezes, during winter, the few inhabitants. The glen is tenanted by three families, who raise oats, and keep a few cattle, sheep, and goats; but seem to have great difficulty in getting their little produce to market.</P>
<P>JUST above the sea is a high and verdant mount, natural; but the top and sides worked on by art. The first flat∣ted: the sides marked with eight prominent ribs from top to bottom. On this might have been the residence of the unfortunate prince; of which, time has destroyed every other vestige. Till the beginning of the last century, a tumulus, of stone within, and externally covered with turf, was to be seen here; it was known by the name of <HI>Bedd Gwrtheyrn:</HI> tradi∣tion having regularly delivered down the report of this having been the place of his interment. The inhabitants of the parish, perhaps instigated by their then minister, Mr. <HI>Hugh Roberts,</HI> a person of curiosity, dug into the carn, and found in it a stone coffin, containing the bones of a tall man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kenne's Paroch. Antiq. Hist. Allchester, <HI>698.</HI></NOTE>. This gives a degree of credibility to the tradition, especially as no other bones were found with it; no other <HI>tumuli</HI> on the spot: a proof at lest of respect to the rank of the person; and that the place was deserted after the death of the royal fugitive, about the year 465.</P>
<P><PB REF="223"/><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="224"/>AFTER emerging out of this chearless bottom, I found fresh and amazing matter of speculation. I got into a <HI>bwlch,</HI> or hollow, between two summits of the <HI>Eifl</HI> mountains;<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE EIFL HILLS.</NOTE> a range that makes a most distinguished figure, with the sugar-loaf points, from various and distant parts of the country: they range obliquely, and separate <HI>Lleyn</HI> from the hundred of <HI>Arfon,</HI> and jut into the sea near <HI>Vortigern's valley.</HI></P>
<P>ACROSS this hollow, from one summit of the <HI>Eifl</HI> to the other, extends an immense rampart of stones, or perhaps the ruins of a wall, which effectually blocked up the pass. On the <HI>Eifl</HI> is the most perfect and magnificent, as well as the most artful, of any <HI>British</HI> post I ever beheld. It is called <HI>Tre'r Caeri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE'R CAERI.</NOTE> or, the <HI>Town of the Fortresses.</HI> This, which was the accessible side, is defended by three walls; the lowest is very imperfect, the next tolerably entire, and has in it the grand entrance. This wall in one part points upwards towards the third wall, which runs round the edges of the top of the hill: the second wall unites with the first, which runs into a point, re∣verts, and joins the highest, in a place where the hill becomes inaccessible. The facings on the two upper walls are very entire, especially that of the uppermost. They are lofty, and exhibit from below a grand and extensive front. The space on the top is an irregular area; part is steep, part flat: in most parts covered with heath, giving shelter to a few red grouse. The whole is almost filled with cells. To be seen with advantage, the station should be taken from the summit, about which the cells are very distinct, and disposed with much art. About the middle is a square place fenced with stones; a sort of <HI>praetorium,</HI> surrounded with two rows of cells: numbers
<PB N="207" REF="225"/>
are also scattered about the plain, and others again are conti∣guous to the wall all along the inside.</P>
<P>THE cells are mostly perfect: of various forms; round, oval, oblong, square. Some of the round were fifteen feet in dia∣meter; of the oblong, thirty feet in length, with long entrances regularly faced with stone. All of them, when inhabited, were well protected from the weather by roofs of thatch or sod.</P>
<P>THE upper wall was in many places fifteen feet high on the outside, and often sixteen feet broad. It consisted of two pa∣rallel and contiguous parts, one higher than the other, serving as a parapet to the lower, which seemed to have had its walk, like that on the walls of <HI>Chester.</HI> There was in one place a cell in the thickness of the wall, or perhaps a sally-port, in part stopped by the falling-in of the stones.</P>
<P>I was determined to trace every species of fortress of this nature which lay in the neighborhood. On descending from <HI>Tre'r Caeri</HI> to the south,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GARY GUWCH.</NOTE> I very soon ascended <HI>Moel Garn Guwh,</HI> a hill of conic form, on the summit of which is a prodigious heap of stones, seemingly a shapeless ruin; if it was not for the appearance of certain facings of a central cell still remaining, to prove that it had been a large tower, and an out-post to the preceeding place. These ruins are called by the country people <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d y G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s,</HI> or, The apron-full of stones flung <HI>down by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>s.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST remark, that from the <HI>Eift</HI> saw sveral other lesser eminences fortified in a manner nearly similar. I may men∣tion <HI>Carn Madryn,</HI> before described; the hill of <HI>Boduan,</HI> above <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> covered with similar cells; <HI>Meel ben Twrch,</HI> between <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>;</HI> and <HI>Castell Gwgan,</HI> remarkable for a

<PB N="208" REF="227"/>small circular intrenchment; and to these I may add another fortified hill, called <HI>Pen y Gaer,</HI> on the other side of the pass which leads from <HI>Arfon to Llŷn:</HI> all which makes it probable that this country was the retreat of multitudes of <HI>Britons,</HI> to escape the first fury of the <HI>Saxon</HI> invaders.</P>
<P>AFTER viewing the <HI>Arffedoged-y-Gowres,</HI> I descended to the village and church of <HI>Llan-Aelhaiearn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLAN-AELHALEARN.</NOTE> the last dedicated to St. <HI>Aelhaiearn,</HI> or, the saint with an <HI>iron eyebrow,</HI> from a legend too absurd to relate. Near it is a fine well, once much fre∣quented for its reputed sanctity. Continue descending: on the right are the high conic hills of <HI>Gern goch</HI> and <HI>Gern ddu,</HI> the extremity of the long chain which extends obliquely from <HI>Snowdon,</HI> beginning at <HI>Talmignèdd.</HI> Reach</P>
<P>CLYNNOG,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLYNNOG.</NOTE> seated in a small grove near the shore, on a plain near the foot of the hills.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> The church is the most magnificent structure of its kind in <HI>North Wales,</HI> built in form of a cross; the length from east to west is about a hundred and thirty-eight feet, from north to south seventy. Near the altar are three neat stalls, divided by pillars supporting gothic arches, the seats of the officiating priests. The monuments are few: one to <HI>Wil∣liam Glynn de Lleiar,</HI> with his figure, and those of his wife and seven children: another to his son-in-law <HI>George Twisleton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Aula Barrow</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and in right of his wife, of <HI>Lleiar.</HI> I imagine him to be the same with Colonel <HI>Twisleton,</HI> an active officer under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the same who had the honor of beating and making prisoner the gallant Sir <HI>John Owen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock's Memorials,</HI> 311, and 454, 599.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="228"/>ADJOINING to the church is the chapel of St. <HI>Beuno.</HI> The passage to it is a narrow vault covered with great flat stones, and of far greater antiquity than either church or chapel; which seem nearly coeval. <HI>Leland</HI> speaks of the first as <HI>new worke,</HI> and the architecture verifies his account. He speaks also of the old church, where St. <HI>Beuno</HI> lieth, being near the new<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Itin. v.</HI> 13.</NOTE>. The passage is the only part left. The chapel was probably built after that traveller had visited the place, in the room of the old church, which might have fallen to ruin. In the midst is the tomb of the saint, plain, and altar-shaped.<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMB OF ST. BEUNO.</NOTE> Vota∣ries were wont to have great faith in him, and did not doubt but that by means of a night's lodging on his tomb, a cure would be found for all diseases. It was customary to cover it with rushes, and leave on it till morning sick children, after making them first undergo ablution in the neighboring holy well; and I myself once saw on it a feather bed, on which a poor paralytic from <HI>Meirionyddshire</HI> had lain the whole night, after undergoing the same ceremony.</P>

The land was clamed in behalf of a little infant, and his title proved good: the king refuses either to give other land in lieu, or to resign the pre∣sent. <HI>Beuno</HI> cursed him, and went away; but was appeased by <HI>Gwrddeint,</HI> first cousin to the king, who overtook him, and
<PB N="210" REF="229"/>
gave the town of <HI>Celynnog</HI> for ever to GOD and St. <HI>Beuno,</HI> for his own soul's sake, and that of the wicked <HI>Cadwallan.</HI> Long after his time, the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> or white monks, had here an establishment. They were suppressed, but I cannot learn the period. At the time of the <HI>Lincoln</HI> taxation, or the year 1291, the church was collegiate, consisting of five portionists or pre∣bendaries; and it continued so to the dissolution<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 705.</NOTE>. The rectory is a sinecure annexed to the headship of JESUS College, <HI>Oxford;</HI> the poor vicarage is the gift of the bishop.</P>
<P>ITS revenues at the dissolution are not recorded; but they must at one time have been very great: many of the kings and first: people of the country appear on the list of benefactors. <HI>Cadwaladr</HI> gave <HI>Grayanoc; Tegwared</HI> gave <HI>Porthamel; Cadel</HI> be∣stowed <HI>Kylcourt;</HI> prince <HI>Mervyn, Carnguin; Cadwgan ap Cynvelyn, Bodveilion</HI> in <HI>Llŷn; Idwal</HI> endowed it with <HI>Penrhos</HI> and <HI>Clynog Vechan</HI> in <HI>Anglesey:</HI> and besides these are numbers of others, for which I refer the reader to my authority<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Monast.</HI> ii. 919.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AT present there are, I believe, no sort of revenues to keep this venerable pile from falling to ruin.

<PB N="211" REF="230"/>
"to break up St. <HI>Beuno</HI>'s chest." The little money resulting from the sacred beasts, or casual offerings, is either applied to the relief of the poor, or in aid of repairs.</P>
<P>THOSE who are curious in druidical antiquities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A CROMLEH.</NOTE> may see a very uncommon <HI>Cromleh</HI> on the tenement of <HI>Bachwen,</HI> about half a mile from this place. The inclination of the upper stone is to the west; on its surface are numbers of small shallow holes, with two or three larger than the rest, possibly for some purpose of augury. At thirty paces distance is an upright stone, placed, as is supposed, to mark the limits of approach to the people, while the rites were performing by the <HI>Druid∣priest.</HI></P>
<P>THE distance from <HI>Clynnog</HI> to <HI>Caernarvon</HI> is ten miles; a continued plain: the mountains recede gradually from the sea, so as to leave a considerable extent of level ground as we ap∣proach the capital of the county. The road is excellent, and the greatest part has the merit of being made at the expence of the parishes. The shore is low, gravelly, or sandy, and forms one side of the bay of <HI>Caernarvon.</HI></P>
<P>CROSS the <HI>Llyfni,</HI> a rapid stream flowing out of <HI>Llyn Nanlle.</HI> I heard here of a strong camp, called <HI>Carreg y Di∣nas;</HI> of which I find this note in the MS. travels of the late ingenious Dr. <HI>Mason</HI> of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> He mentions it as being placed upon the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of the <HI>Llyfni,</HI> opposite to the house of <HI>Lleiar.</HI> The three sides to the river are very steep; the fourth is defended by two fosses and two banks, made chiefly of stone, especially the inner one, which is six yards high. In the middle is a mount, possibly the ruins of a tower. The entrance is at the east end, between the ends of the banks.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="231"/>ABOUT three miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DINAS DINLLE.</NOTE> turn to the left, to visit <HI>Dinas Dinlle,</HI> a vast mount of gravel and sand, on the verge of a great marsh, upon the shore. On the top is a large area, surrounded by an amaz∣ing agger, seemingly formed by the earth scooped out of the summit. Within are remains of foundations of buildings, of an oblong form, constructed with earth and round stones; and in one part is a tumulus of the same materials. On the outside of the agger, on one part, is a very deep ditch, with another high rampart; and the ground towards the base seems every where to have been smoothed by art. There is a regular entrance at one end; on the other, the ground slopes to the sea, and is quite open, a defence being there needless. The waves have made great depredations, and worn one side into a cliff. I must attribute this fortress to the <HI>Romans;</HI> and am the more confirmed in my notion, as I am informed that coins have been found here, among which was one of <HI>Alectus.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> might possibly be induced to form this post, to secure a landing-place for any necessaries the country might want; for the entrance into the port <HI>Segontium</HI> ▪s often, even at pre∣sent, very difficult; much more so in the earlier times of navi∣gation.</P>

<P>WHEN I made my visit to <HI>Dinas Dinlle,</HI> I was under the guidance of a worthy friend, and learned antiquary, the Re∣verend <HI>Richard Farrington</HI> (now deceased). He conducted me to his residence at <HI>Dines Dincethwy,</HI> about four miles distant. In the way he shewed to me <HI>Dinas y Prif,</HI> or, The Post of the Chieftain; a small camp, about forty-four yards square. Each corner is elevated above the ramparts; and withinside are foundations of some stone buildings. By the name, it might: be the summer station of the <HI>Roman</HI> commander in chief, resident in winter at <HI>Segontium.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Dinas</HI> I visited <HI>Glynllivon,</HI> a house built by the late Sir <HI>John Wynn,</HI> seated near the little river <HI>Llifon,</HI> issuing from the <HI>Kilgwyn</HI> mountain. <HI>Cilmin Troed-ddu,</HI> or, <HI>Cilmin</HI> with a <HI>black foot,</HI> one of the fifteen tribes of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and nephew to <HI>Merfyn Fryeh,</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> slain in 841, had his residence on this spot. From him are descended the family of the <HI>Glynns,</HI> who took their name from the place. They bear, in allusion to the name of their ancestor, a man's leg, <HI>coupè a la cuisse,</HI> sable. A ridiculous legend tells you, that <HI>Cilmin</HI>'s leg became so dis∣colored by escaping from a daemon, whose books he had assisted a magician to steal. In leaping over a brook, which was to be the limit of the pursuit, <HI>Cilmin</HI>'s left leg plunged into the water, and assumed its sable dye. Our stories are absurd; but not more so than an Eastern tale. <HI>Glynllivon</HI> came into pos∣session of the late Sir <HI>John Wynn,</HI> by the marriage of his father,

I greatly suspect the <HI>Caernarvon</HI> of those times to have been no other than the antient <HI>Segontium,</HI> whose name the <HI>Welsh</HI> had changed to the apt one of <HI>Caer ar Fôn,</HI> or, The strong hold opposite to <HI>Anglesey.</HI> But the present town was in all probability a creation of our conqueror. A judicious warrior, such as <HI>Edward,</HI> could not fail profiting of so fit a situ∣ation for a curb on the new-conquered country. It had natural requisites for strength; being bounded on one side by the arm of the sea called the <HI>Menai;</HI> by the estuary of the <HI>Seiont</HI> on another, exactly where it receives the tide from the former; on a third side, and part of the fourth, by a creek of the <HI>Me∣nai;</HI> and the remainder has the appearance of having the in∣sulation completed by art. <HI>Edward</HI> undertook this great work immediately after his conquest of the country in 1282, and completed the fortifications and castle before 1284; for his queen, on <HI>April</HI> 25th in that year, brought forth within its
<PB N="215" REF="234"/>
walls <HI>Edward,</HI> first prince of <HI>Wales</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> line. It was built within the space of one year, by the labor of the peasants, and at the cost of the chieftains of the country, on whom the conqueror imposed the hateful task<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>. <HI>Henry Ellerton,</HI> or <HI>de Elreton,</HI> was appointed master mason of the castle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> and <HI>Gloddaeth MSS.</HI></NOTE>, and per∣haps was the architect; and under him must have been num∣bers of other skilful workmen: for I dare say that the <HI>Welsh</HI> peasants were no mare than cutters of wood and hewers of stone. It is probable that many of the materials were brought from <HI>Segontium,</HI> or the old <HI>Caernarvon;</HI> and tradition says, that much ot the lime-stone, with which it is built, was brought from <HI>Twr-kelyn</HI> in <HI>Anglesey;;</HI> and of the grit-stone, from <HI>Vaenol</HI> in this county. The <HI>Menai</HI> greatly facilitated the car∣riage from both places.</P>
<P>THE external state of the walls and castle are at present exactly as they were in the time of <HI>Edward.</HI> The walls are defended by numbers of round towers, and have two principal gates: the east, facing the mountains: the west, upon the <HI>Menai.</HI> The entrance into the castle is very august, beneath a great tower, on the front of which appears the statue of the founder, with a dagger in his hand, as if menacing his new-acquired unwilling subjects. The gate had four portcullises, and every requisite of strength. The court is oblong. The towers are very beautiful; none of them round, but pentago∣nal, hexagonal, or octagonal: two are more lofty than the rest. The Eagle tower is remarkably fine, and has the ad∣dition of three slender angular turrets issuing from the top. <HI>Edward</HI> II. was born in a little dark room in this tower, not</P>

<P>THE walls of this fortress are about seven feet nine inches thick; and have within their thickness a most convenient gal∣lery, with narrow slips, for the discharge of arrows.

<P>THE first whom I find appointed by <HI>Edward</HI> to be governor of the castle, was <HI>John de Havering,</HI> with a salary of two hun∣dred marks; for which he was obliged to maintain constantly, besides his own family, fourscore men, of which fifteen were to be cross-bowmen, one chaplain, one surgeon, and one smith; the rest were to do the duty of keepers of the gates, centinels, and other necessary offices<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1289, I find that the king had appointed <HI>Adam de Weten∣hall</HI> to the same important office<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ayloff's Rotulae Wailiae, <HI>98.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE establishment for town and castle was as follows:</P>
<P>THE constable of the castle had sometimes sixty pounds, at others only forty.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="237"/>THE captain of the town had 12<HI>l.</HI> 3<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> for his annual fee; but this office was sometimes annexed to the former, and then the see was 60<HI>l.</HI> for both.</P>
<P>THE constable and the captain had twenty-four soldiers al∣lowed them for the defence of the place, at the wages of 4<HI>d.</HI> per day each. Surely this slight garrison was only during peaceful times!</P>

<P>I can discover no more than two instances of this place hav∣ing suffered by the calamities of war. In the great insurrec∣tion of the <HI>Welsh,</HI> under <HI>Madog,</HI> in 1294, they surprised the town during the time of a fair, and put many <HI>English</HI> to the sword<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 380.</NOTE>; and, according to Mr. <HI>Carte</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carte,</HI> ii. 237.</NOTE>, took the castle, that of <HI>Snowdon (Conway),</HI> and made himself master of all <HI>Anglesey.</HI></P>
<P>In the last century, Captain <HI>Swanly,</HI> a parlementarian officer, took the town in 1644, made four hundred prisoners, and got a great quantity of arms, ammunition, and pillage. The royal∣ists afterwards repossessed themselves of the place. Lord <HI>Byron</HI> was appointed governor; was besieged by General <HI>Mytton</HI> in 1646, and yielded the place on the most honorable terms. In 1648, the General himself and Colonel <HI>Moson</HI> were besieged in it by Sir <HI>John Owen;</HI> who hearing that Colonel <HI>Carter</HI> and Co∣lonel <HI>Twisselton</HI> were on the march to relieve the place, drew a party from the siege, in order to attack them on the way. The parties met near <HI>Llandegay:</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> was defeated, and made

<P>CAERNARVON is destitute of manufactures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE.</NOTE> but has a brisk trade with <HI>London, Bristol, Leverpool,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> for the several necessaries of life. It is the residence of numbers of genteel families; and contains several very good houses; a very antient one, called <HI>Plâs Pulesdon,</HI> is remarkable for the fate of its first owner, Sir <HI>Roger de Pulesdon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROGER DE PULES∣DON.</NOTE> a distinguished favorite of <HI>Edward</HI> I, He had been appointed sheriff and keeper of the county of <HI>Anglesey</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ayloff's Rotulae Walliae, <HI>89.</HI></NOTE> in 1284. What office he held here, I am unacquainted with; but in 1294, being directed to levy the subsidy for the <HI>French</HI> war, a tax the <HI>Welsh</HI> had never been accustomed to, they took up arms, and hanged <HI>de Pulesdon</HI> and several of his people. This was a signal for a general insurrection: <HI>Madoc,</HI> a relation of the late Prince <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> headed the people of this country. <HI>Edward</HI> marched against them in person, and with great difficulty reduced the country to submit again to his yoke<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt, Westm.</HI> 423.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE church is no more than a chapel to <HI>Llan Beblic;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL.</NOTE> and probably originally only a chapel to the garrison.</P>
<P>EDWARD I. bestowed on <HI>Caernarvon</HI> its first royal charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARTER.</NOTE> and made it a free borough.

<P>The mother church of <HI>Caenarvon</HI> is about half a mile south∣east of the town; is called <HI>Llan Beblic,</HI> being dedicated to Sr. <HI>Peblic</HI> or <HI>Peblicius,</HI> (according to our historians) son of <HI>Maxon Wledic</HI> (<HI>Maximus</HI> the tyrant) and his wife <HI>Helen,</HI> daughter of <HI>Euddaf.</HI> It is said that he retired from the world and took a religious habit<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rowlands' Mena denqua, <HI>165.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Richard</HI> II. bestowed this church, and the chayel of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> on the nuns of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in <HI>Chester,</HI> in consideration of their poverty<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE> I find in the recital of another charter of the same prince, that his grandfather <HI>Edward</HI> III. had bestowed on those religious the advowson of <HI>Llangathen</HI> in <HI>Caer∣martsoershire</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE>: both which, on the dissolution, were annexed to the see of <HI>Chester,</HI> and remain to this day under the patronage of the Bishop of <HI>Chester.</HI> In the church is the tomb of a son<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">This son.

<P>NEAR the steep bank of the river <HI>Seiont,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN FORT.</NOTE> at a small distance from the castle, is an ancient <HI>Roman</HI> fort. On two sides the walls are pretty entire; one is seventy-four yards long; the other, which points to the river, is sixty-four. The height ten feet eight inches. The thickness six feet. Much of the facing is taken away, which discovers the peculiarity of the <HI>Roman</HI> masonry. It consists of regular courses, the others have the stones disposed in zigzag fashion. Along the walls are three parallel lines of round holes, not three inches in diameter, nicely plastered within, which pass through the whole thickness. There are other similar holes, which are discovered in the end of the wall; and seem to run through it lengthways. I can discover the use of neither one or other. Those that run through the walls are supposed to be for the purpose of annoy∣ing an enemy with arrows; but from the smallness of the dia∣meter, a compass of aim in directing the shot is wanting. Near the corner of one of the walls is a heap of stones, the ruins of a tower; for on digging, some years ago, the founda∣tion of a found one was discovered. It was paved, and in it were found the horn of a deer and skeletons of some lesser ani∣mals. This place seems intended to secure a landing-place from the <HI>Seiont,</HI> at time of high water; and I was informed, that in <HI>Tre'r Beblic,</HI> on the opposite shore, had been other ruins, the work of the same people.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="241"/>AT a small distance above this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEGONTIUM.</NOTE> and about a quarter of a mile from the <HI>Menai,</HI> is the antient <HI>Segontium,</HI> to the use of which the fort had been subservient. It forms an oblong of a very considerable extent, seemingly about six acres, placed on the summit of rising ground, and sloping down on every side. It is now divided by the public road; but in several parts are vestiges of walls; and in one place appears the remnant of a building made with tiles, and plastered with very hard and smooth mortar: this seems to have been part of a <HI>hypocaust.</HI> The mortar in all other parts is very hard, and mixed with much gravel and sand. At present a public road passes through the midst of this antient station, beyond which the <HI>Romans</HI> had only a small out-post or two in this county. A gold coin, of about seventeen shillings weight, was found here, inscribed T. DIVI AVG, FIL AVGVTVS.</P>
<P>CAMBDEN suspects that this might have been the <HI>Setantiorum Portus</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> being willing to read it <HI>Segontiorum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ii. 798.</NOTE>; but the situation of the former is certainly at the mouth of the <HI>Ribble.</HI> He may be right in supposing it to have been in after times named <HI>Caer Custenin,</HI> or the Castle of <HI>Constantine</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nennius.</NOTE>, and that <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> who certainly invaded <HI>Anglesey</HI> in 1098, had here a temporary post. How far the relation of <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>West∣minster,</HI> that <HI>Censtantius,</HI> father of <HI>Constantine,</HI> was interred here, may be depended on, I will not say; nor whether, as the histo∣rian farther asserts, that <HI>Edward</HI> caused the body to be taken up, and honorably re-buried in the church, I suppose of St. <HI>Publicius</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat.

<P>THE traveller who wishes to visit <HI>Snowdon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROAD FROM CAERNARVON TO SNOWDON.</NOTE> from this town, may have a very agreeable ride. After crossing the <HI>Fai,</HI> or <HI>Gwyrfai</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This river issues out of <HI>Llyn Cwellyn,</HI> and separates the two Hundreds of <HI>Uwch-Gwrfai</HI> and <HI>Is-Gwrfai.</HI></NOTE>, at <HI>Pont y Bettws,</HI> about four miles and a half from <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> he will find about the village of <HI>Bettws Garmon,</HI> or <HI>Is-Gwrfai,</HI> a beautiful cascade fronting him, as he passes up a valley; which consists of verdant meadows, watered by the same river, and bounded by hills rising fast into <HI>alpine</HI> majesty. He will go under <HI>Moel Elian,</HI> a noble mountain of a stupendous bulk, cloathed with a smooth green turf, and most regularly rounded. He will pass on the right near <HI>Castell Cedwm,</HI> said by Mr. <HI>Rowlands</HI> to be one of the guards to the entrance into <HI>Snowdon:</HI> it is a great rock; which I did not ascend, so cannot certify whether it had any works like those of other <HI>British</HI> posts. The lake <HI>Cwellyn</HI> here almost fills the valley; a water famous for its Char, which are taken in nets in the first winter months, and after that season retire to the inaccessible depths. In former times, this water was called, from the steepness of its banks, <HI>Llyn y Torlennydd.</HI> Above, on the right side of the lake, soars the magnificent <HI>Mynnydd Vawr,</HI> smooth on the top, but the sides receding inwards in a semicircular form, exhi∣biting a tremendous precipice.

<P>FROM <HI>Caernarvon</HI> I crossed in the ferry to <HI>Tal y Voel,</HI> in the island of ANGLESEY.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Menai</HI> is here two miles broad. In my passage had a view of <HI>Abermenai,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ABERMENAI.</NOTE> the very narrow passage into the port of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> and rendered more dangerous by the sands both within and without. <HI>Abermenai</HI> has its ferry, and is one of the five over this strait. They were originally the property of the crown of <HI>England;</HI> till <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. granted all of them to <HI>Richard Gifford,</HI> one of the sewers of his chamber; who again set them to <HI>William Bulkely,</HI> in the 33d year of his royal master: but since that period, every one has been transferred to other hands.</P>
<P>I SOON reached <HI>Newborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NEWBOROUGH.</NOTE> about three miles from the shore, a place greatly fallen away from its antient splendor. Here had been one of the resi¦dences of his princes. In Mr. <HI>Row∣lands'</HI> time, the foundation of the <HI>Llŷs,</HI> or palace, was to be seen a little to the south of the church; which is supposed to have been the domestic chapel. In its neighborhood, at <HI>Vrondeg,</HI> is a stone which I overlooked. I find it mentioned in the manuscripts of Mr. ROWLANDS; who has given the following inscription: CUR .....

<P>NEWBOROUGH, or more properly <HI>Rhos-vair,</HI> the <HI>British</HI> name, was a manor of our princes. It was divided into two parts; the one consisted of officers of the houshold under the prince; which were of two kinds, and had twelve gavels in land be∣tween them: part maintained the <HI>Maer-drefyrs,</HI> or persons who overlooked his demesn; the other was for the <HI>Garddwyr,</HI> certain persons resembling our cottagers, who possessed small parcels of land called <HI>Gardds.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Record of Caer∣narvon, in Biblioth.

<PB N="225" REF="245"/>
and continued so long after it became subject to the <HI>English.</HI> A respect to a royal seat was still maintained by the new royal possessors. It became a manor of the princes of <HI>Wales.

The crown had its steward for this district, with a salary of ten pounds a year. The palace and royal chapel existed in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III; for it appears by an inquisition taken here in 1329, before <HI>William de Shalde∣ford,</HI> representative of <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> justiciary of <HI>North Wales,</HI> that the tenants of the commot of <HI>Menai</HI> had been required to put those buildings into repair: but, on their representing that, if that duty was put in force, they would be of little or no advantage to the king, the justiciary was directed to enquire into the truth; and whether it would not be better for him to take an annual sum in lieu of the repairs, not only of the palace and chapel, but of all the other buildings on the royal manor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE> In after times it had the honor of send∣ing representatives to the <HI>British</HI> parlement. <HI>Richard ap Rhydderch ap Myfyrian</HI> sate in the third of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and <HI>John ap Robert Llwyd</HI> in the first of <HI>Edward</HI> VI; who in the next year transferred this honor to <HI>Beaumaris.</HI> The glory of <HI>Newborough</HI> is now passed away.</P>

Not a vestige is to be seen of its former boast. It was a chief seat of our princes, and one of the three courts of justice for the principality<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leges Wallicae,</HI> 147.</NOTE>. Here was always kept one of the three copies of the antient

This place was of great antiquity, being one of the three fixed on by <HI>Roderic</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> about the year 870, for the residence of his successors. In 962 it was ravaged by the <HI>Irish</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 62.</NOTE>. An extent was made of <HI>Aberfraw</HI> in the 13th <HI>Edward</HI> III; from which may be learned some of the antient revenues of the <HI>Welsh</HI> princes. It appears that part arose from rents of lands, from the profit of mills and fisheries, and often in things in kind; but the last were frequently com∣muted for their value in money. Thus one place payed XIII<SUP>s</SUP> VII<SUP>d</SUP> instead of butter, milk, and services in work; and another dis∣trict rendered for CIV sheep, IX hens, and XXXVII<SUP>s</SUP> II<SUP>d</SUP> in lieu of the labor of a hundred and sixty-one days.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the <HI>Menai.</HI> From <HI>Newhorough</HI> I visited <HI>Llanidan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANIDAN.</NOTE> a seat of Lord <HI>Boston</HI>'s, finely situated on that arm of the sea, commanding upwards a beautiful, prospect of <HI>Caernar∣von,</HI> and the <HI>Snowdon</HI> hills. The church, which is adjacent, was once belonging to the convent of <HI>Beddcelert.</HI> In 1535 it followed, the sate of that house. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it to <HI>Edmond Downam</HI> and <HI>Peter Ashton;</HI> who sold it in 1605 to <HI>Richard Prytherch</HI> of <HI>Myfyrian,</HI> whose daughter married a <HI>Llwyd</HI> of <HI>Llugwy,</HI> on the other side of the island. On the ex∣tinction of that family all their estates were bought by Lord <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> who left them to his nephew Sir <HI>William Irby,</HI> the late Lord <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>IN the church is a reliquary, made neither of gold nor silver,
<PB N="229" REF="249"/>
nor yet ornamented with precious stones; but of very ordinary gritstone, with a roof-like cover. Whether it contained any reliques of the patron saint, a St. <HI>Aiden,</HI> of whom the venerable <HI>Bede</HI> makes such honorable mention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De vita Cudbercti, <HI>,c. 4.</HI></NOTE>, I cannot say. The church of <HI>Durham</HI> possessed his cross, three of his teeth, his head, and two Griffin's eggs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smith's Beda, App. <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP> XV.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>I MUST not pass unnoticed the celebrated stone <HI>Maen Mordbwyd,</HI> or the stone <HI>of the thigh,</HI> now well secured in the wall of this church. In old times it was so constant to one place, that, let it be carried ever so far, it would be sure of returning at night. <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> determined to subdue its loco-motive faculties, fastened it with iron chains to a far greater stone, and flung it into the sea; but, to the astonish∣ment of all beholders, it was found the next morning in its usual place<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Giraldus Itin. Cambr.</HI> lib. ii. c. vii. and <HI>Powel</HI>'s note. <HI>Giraldus</HI> says, the stone took its name from its shape.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I NOW enter on classical ground, and the pious seats of the antient <HI>Druids;</HI> the sacred groves, the altars, and monumental stones. A slight mention of what I saw must content my reader; who is referred to the works of the celebrated and learned Mr. <HI>Henry Rowlands,</HI> the former rector of this place, and to those of my friend the late reverend Dr. <HI>Borlase,</HI> who hath added fresh illustrations of these obscure remains.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Tre'r Dryw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE'R DRYW.</NOTE> or the habitation of the <HI>Arch-Druid,</HI> I met with the mutilated remains described by Mr. <HI>Rowlands.</HI> His
<PB N="230" REF="250"/>
<HI>Bryn Gwyn,</HI> or <HI>Brein Gwyn,</HI> or royal tribunal, is a circular hollow of a hundred and eighty feet in diameter, surrounded by an immense agger of earth and stones, evidently brought from some other place, there not being any mark of their being taken from the spot. It has only a single entrance. This is supposed to have been the grand consistory of the druidical administration.</P>
<P>Not far from it was one of the <HI>Gorseddau,</HI> now in a manner dispersed, but once consisted of a great copped heap of stones, on which sate aloft a <HI>Druid</HI> instructing the surrounding people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mona Antiq.</HI> 92. <HI>tab. iv.</HI></NOTE> <HI>multa de Deorum immortalium vi et potestate disputare, et juven∣tuti tradunt</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cesar.

<P>HERE were also the reliques of a circle of stones, with the <HI>Cromlech</HI> in the midst; but all extremely imperfect. Two of the stones are very large; one, which serves at present as part of the end of a house, is twelve feet seven inches high, and eight feet broad; and another eleven feet high and twenty-three feet in girth. Some lesser stones yet remain. This circle, when complete, was one of the temples of the Druids, in which their religious rites were performed. It is the conjecture of Mr. <HI>Rowlands,</HI> that the whole of these remains were surrounded with a circle of OAKS, and formed a deep and sacred grove, <HI>Tam per se roborum elegunt lucos, neque ulla sacra sine ea fronde conficiunt</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Plin.

<P>THE shore near <HI>Porthamel,</HI> not far from hence, is famed for being the place where <HI>Suetonius</HI> landed, and put an end in this island to the <HI>Druid</HI> reign.

ON the shore stood a motley army in close array, and well armed; with women running wildly about in black attire with disheveled hair, and like the furies brandishing their torches; surrounded by the <HI>Druids,</HI> lifting up their hands to heaven, and pouring forth the most dreadful im∣precations.

<P>I AM sorry that it is not in my power to give a better ac∣count than the following of that prodigy of learning the re∣verend HENRY ROWLANDS, vicar of this parish. His account of the druidical antiquities of this part of the island, and his comments on them, is a most extraordinary performance, con∣sidering that he never enjoyed any other literary advantages than what he found in his native isle. It is sayed that he never even travelled farther than <HI>Conway;</HI> but I believe it is certain that Shrewshury was the farthest limits of his travels. He died in 1723, aged 68, and was interred under a slab of black <HI>Anglesey</HI> marble, in the parish of <HI>Llanedwen.</HI> He was descended from <HI>Henry Rowlands,</HI> who died Bishop of <HI>Bangor</HI> in 1616, and who in 1600 purchased from <HI>Robert Gryffydd</HI> of <HI>Penrhyn</HI> the estate of <HI>Plas Gwyn,</HI> in the fore-mentioned parish, which re∣mains to this day in his posterity.

<P>AT a small distance from <HI>Moel y Don</HI> I entered into the fine woods of Sir <HI>Nicholas Bayley,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WOODS.</NOTE> skirting the <HI>Menai</HI> for a confi∣derable way. The wooded part of the island is on this side. It commences at <HI>Llanidan,</HI> and recalls the antient name of <HI>Anglesey, Ynys Dywyll,</HI> or the <HI>Dark Island,</HI> on account of the deep shade of its groves: but at present it is (except in this part) entirely divested of trees; and the climate so averse to their growth, that in most parts it is with great difficulty the gentry can raise a plantation round their houses.</P>
<P>PLAS NEWYDD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLAS NEWYDD.</NOTE> the seat of Sir <HI>Nicholas Bayley,</HI> lies close upon the water, protected on three sides by venerable oaks and ashes.

The mansion has been improved, and altered to a castellated form, by the present owner.</P>
<P>IN the woods are some very remarkable druidical antiquities, Behind the house are to be seen two vast <HI>Cromlechs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CROMLECHS.</NOTE> The up∣per
<PB N="237" REF="257"/>
stone of one is twelve feet seven inches long, twelve broad, and four thick, supported by five tall stones. The other is but barely separated from the first: is almost a square, of five feet and a half, and supported by four stones. The number of supporters to <HI>Cromlechs</HI> are merely accidental, and depend on the size or form of the incumbent stone. These are the most magnificent we have, and the highest from the ground; for a middle-sized horse may easily pass under the largest.</P>
<P>DR. BORLASE has shewn the improbability of these stones ever being designed or used as altars. The figure proves the impossibility of making fires, or performing sacrifices on their sloping summits; and almost all which I have seen have an inclination. It is reasonable to suppose them to have been se∣pulchral monuments, and that the body might be lodged in the space beneath; and near the monument divine honors might be payed, or sacrifices performed to the manes of the dead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See what the learned author offers in support of his opinion, <HI>Antiq, Corn∣wal,</HI> p. 210. and the following.</NOTE>.</P>

Probably all those which we see in our island might originally have been thus closed up; but in time destroyed, either through the sacrilegious hope of finding wealth deposited with the corpses, or, as is the case often at present, for the sake of applying the stones to oecono∣mical uses.

<P>NOT far from the Cromlech is a large <HI>Carnedd:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CARNEDD.</NOTE> part has been removed, and within was discovered a cell about seven feet long and three wide, covered at top with two flat stones, and lined on the sides with others. To get in I crept over a flag, placed across the entrance. On the top of the stone were two semicircular holes, of size sufficient to take in the human neck; it is conjectured, that above might have been another; so that both together might perform the office of a stocks. It is in∣deed conjecture, yet not an improbable one, that in this place had been kept the wretches destined for sacrifice; as it is well known that they performed those execrable rites, and often upon captives who had suffered long imprisonment<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Borlase Antiq.

<P>A LITTLE lower down, on a small rocky peninsula, stands the church of <HI>Llandyssilio,</HI> jutting far into the water; a most dreary cure. It is remarkable that most of the seventy-four parishes, which this island is divided into, have their churches not re∣mote from the shores.</P>
<P>PORTH-AETHWY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTH-AETHWY.</NOTE> the most general ferry into <HI>Anglesey,</HI> is im∣mediately below the church.

<P>THE country from hence, and quite to <HI>Holyhead</HI> (twenty-five miles) right and left, is dreary, woodless, hedgeless, rising
<PB N="242" REF="264"/>
into small hills, watered with numberless rills, and fertile in grass and corn.</P>
<P>I CONTINUED my ride near the <HI>Menai,</HI> which now widens considerably. The opposite limits are inexpressibly beautiful, lofty, and finely cloathed with hanging woods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">NOBLE VIEWS.</NOTE> <HI>Bangor</HI> opens on the <HI>Caernarvonshire</HI> side; and in front is a magnificent bay, bounded by the great promontory <HI>Pen Maen Mawr,</HI> and the vast <HI>Llandidno,</HI> apparently insulated; and the estuary of the river <HI>Conwwy</HI> flows at its bottom between those noble headlands. This prospect is seen to best advantage from that beautiful spot the Green, near the castle of <HI>Beaumaris:</HI> from whence may be seen, in addition, <HI>Priestholm</HI> island, and the semilunar bay from thence to the town; the fortress itself; <HI>Baron Hill,</HI> and its elegant improvements; nor must <HI>Red Hill,</HI> the house of Mr. <HI>Sparrow,</HI> seated at the head of a wooded dingle, directing the eye to great part of this delicious view, be left out of the description.</P>
<P>THE town of <HI>Beaumaris</HI> is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEAUMARIS.</NOTE> as the name implies, pleasantly seated on a low land at the water's edge; is neat, and well built, and one street is very handsome. <HI>Edward</HI> I. created the place; for, after founding the castles of <HI>Caernarvon</HI> and <HI>Conway,</HI> he discovered that it was necessary to put another curb on my headstrong countrymen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> He built this fortress in 1295, and fixed on a marshy spot, near the chapel of St. <HI>Meugan,</HI> such as gave him opportunity of forming a great foss round the castle, and of filling it with water from the sea. He also cut a canal, in order to permit vessels to discharge their lading beneath the walls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>: and, as a proof of the existence of such
<PB N="243" REF="265"/>
a conveniency, there were within this century iron rings af∣fixed to them, for the purpose of mooring the ships or boats. The marsh was in early times of far greater extent than at present, and covered with fine bullrushes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS. <HI>and</HI> Plâ Gwyn MSS.</NOTE>. There is even a strong tradition that one <HI>Helig ap Clunog</HI> had great possessions, which extended even to <HI>Dwygyfyechau,</HI> and fair house where now the sea flows; all which were suddenly overwhelmed: and it is pretended that there may still. be seen, at very low ebbs, ruins of houses, and a causeway from <HI>Priestholm</HI> pointing to∣wards <HI>Penmaen Mawr</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">plâs Gwyn MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE lands, on which <HI>Edward</HI> built the castle, were private property: and it appears he made them full satisfaction; and, among other recompences, bestowed on <HI>Eneon ap Meredydd, Gryffydd ap Evan,</HI> and <HI>Eneon ap Tegerin,</HI> lands in the town∣ship of <HI>Earianell,</HI> and Tre'r Ddôl, free from rent or service.

<P>EACH of <HI>Edward</HI>'s, three castles differs in form. This has lest clame to beauty, not having the height or elegance of <HI>Caer∣narvon</HI> or <HI>Conwwy.</HI> The exterior walls are guarded by ten strong round towers. These are the case to the castle, which stands within at a considerable equidistant space; is far superior in height to the former, and has also its round towers. With∣in is a square of one hundred and ninety feet, or, as Mr. <HI>Grose</HI> expresses it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HALL.</NOTE> a square with the corners canted off. The great hall has five windows in front, is seventy feet long, and twenty∣three and a half broad. The approach seems to have been through a sub-hall, by a flight of steps.</P>

<P><PB N="244" REF="267"/>WITHIN, the walls on one side is a beautiful chapel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL.</NOTE> in form of a theatre, the sides ornamented with Gothic arches, and the roof supported by ribs springing from elegant pilasters; be∣tween each of which is a narrow window, and behind some are small closets, gained out of the thickness of the wall, probably allotted to the officers, or persons of rank. A narrow gallery runs within the whole space of the castle walls.</P>
<P>THE entrance faces the sea; and near it is a long narrow ad∣vanced work, called the <HI>Gunners Walk.</HI></P>
<P>THE first: governor, was Sir <HI>William Pickmore,</HI> a <HI>Gascon</HI> knight, appointed by <HI>Edward</HI> I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONSTABLE OF THE CASTLE.</NOTE> There was a constable of the castle, and a captain of the town. The first had an annual fee of forty pounds, the last, of twelve pounds three shillings. and four pence; and the porter of the gate of <HI>Beaumaris</HI> had nine pounds two shillings and six pence. Twenty-four soldiers were allowed for the guard of the castle and town, at four pence a day to each<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dodridge,</HI> 58.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE constable of the castle was always captain of the town, except in one instance: in the 36th of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. Sir <HI>John Boteler.</HI> held the first office, and <HI>Thomas Norreys</HI> the other.</P>
<P>THE castle was extremely burthensome to the country: quarrels were frequent between the garrison and the country people. In the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. a bloody fray happened, in which <HI>David ap Evan ap Howel</HI> of <HI>Llwydiarth,</HI> and many others were slain.</P>
<P>FROM the time of Sir <HI>Rowland Villeville,</HI> alias <HI>Brittayne,</HI> re∣puted base son of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and constable of the castle, the
<PB N="245" REF="268"/>
garrison was withdrawn till the year 1642, when <HI>Thomas Cheadle,</HI> deputy to the Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> then constable, put into it men and ammunition. In 1643, <HI>Thomas Bulkeley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> soon after created Lord <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> succeeded: his son, Colonel <HI>Richard Bulkeley,</HI> and several gentlemen of the country, held it for the king till <HI>June</HI> 1646,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAKEN IN 1646.</NOTE> when it surrendered on honorable terms to General <HI>Mytton,</HI> who made Captain <HI>Evans</HI> his deputy-go∣vernor. In 1653, the annual expence of the garrison was se∣venteen hundred and three pounds.</P>
<P>EDWARD I. when he built the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN.</NOTE> surrounded it with walls, made it a corporation, and endowed it with great pri∣vileges, and lands to a considerable value. He removed the antient freeholders, by exchange of property, into other countries. <HI>Henllŷs,</HI> near the town, was the seat of <HI>Gwerydd ap Rhys Goch,</HI> one of fifteen tribes, and of his posterity till this period, when <HI>Edward</HI> removed them to <HI>Boddle Wyd∣dan</HI> in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> and bestowed their antient patrimony on the corporation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plâs Gwyn MSS.</NOTE>.

<P>THERE is very good anchorage for ships in the bay which lies before the town;<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE BAY.</NOTE> and has seven fathom water even at the lowest ebb. Vessels often find security here in hard gales. The town has no trade of any kind, yet has its customhouse for the casual reception of goods.</P>

Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> I find an order from <HI>Edward</HI> II. to <HI>Robert Power,</HI> chamberlain of <HI>North Wales,</HI> to inspect into the state of the boat, which was then out of repair; and, in case it was feasible, to cause it to be made fit for use, at the expence of the baileywick: but if the boat proved past repair, a new one was to be built, and the expence allowed by the king. It ap∣pears that the people of <HI>Beaumaris</HI> payed annually, for the pri∣vilege of a ferry, thirty shillings into the exchequer; but by this order it seems that the king was to find the boat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>. Af∣ter passing the channel, the distance over the sands to <HI>Aber</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> the point the passenger generally makes for, is four miles.

<P>THE church is dependant on <HI>Llandegvan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> which is in the gift of Lord <HI>Bulkeley.</HI> The former is called the chapel of the Blessed Virgin; yet in antient writings one aile is called St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s chapel, and another that of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> In the first is a beautiful monument of a knight and his lady in white ala∣baster, placed recumbent on an altar tomb. It had been re∣moved to this place on the dissolution, from the religious house at <HI>Llanvaes,</HI> and the memory and names of the persons represented lost.

<P>AT a small distance from the town, on the shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANVAES.</NOTE> stand the remains of <HI>Llanvaes,</HI> or the <HI>Friers.</HI> It was founded by Prince <HI>Llewelyn ap Jerwerth,</HI> and, according to the general tradition of the country, over the grave of his wife <HI>Joan,</HI> daughter of King <HI>John,</HI> who died in 1237, and was interred on the spot. Here also were interred a son of a <HI>Danish</HI> king, Lord <HI>Clifford,</HI> and many barons and knights who fell in the Welsh wars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland's Collect. <HI>i. 65. and</HI> Henry V's patent in <HI>Sebright MSS.</HI></NOTE>. It was dedicated to St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and consecrated by <HI>Howel</HI> bishop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> a prelate who died in 1240. The religious were <HI>Franciscans,</HI> or minor friers. Their church and house were de∣stroyed, and their lands wasted, in the insurrection made soon after the death of <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> our last prince, by his relation <HI>Madoc.

These friers were strong favorers of <HI>Glyndwr Henry,</HI> in his first march against <HI>Owen,</HI> plundered the convent, put several of the friers to the sword, and carried away the rest; but afterwards set them at liberty, made restitution to

<P>AT the dissolution, <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. sold the convent, and its pos∣sessions, to one of his courtiers. They became in later days the property of a family of the name of <HI>White</HI> (now ex∣tinct) who built here a good mansion. It of late became, by purchase, the property of Lord <HI>Bulkeley.</HI> The church is turned into a barn, and the coffin of the Princess <HI>Joan</HI> now serves for a watering-trough. I am informed, that on the farm of <HI>Cremlyn Monach,</HI> once the property of the friery, is cut on a great stone the effigies of its patron St. <HI>Francis;</HI> and that his head is also cut on the stone of a wall, in a street of <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> to which all passengers were to pay their respects, under pain of a forfeit.</P>
<P>ABOUT the year 818,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE.</NOTE> a bloody battle was fought near <HI>Llan∣vaes:</HI> neither occasion or parties are mentioned; but by the text<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 24.</NOTE> I guess it to have been between <HI>Egbert</HI> king of the <HI>West Saxons,</HI> and the <HI>Welsh;</HI> for the former, in the reign of <HI>Merfyn Frych,</HI> carried his arms into all parts of <HI>North Wales.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE farther is <HI>Castell Aber Llienawg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL ABER LLIENAWG.</NOTE> a small square fort, with the remains of a little round tower at each corner. In the middle one stood a square tower. A foss surrounds the whole. A hollow way is carried quite to the shore, and at its extremity is a large mound of earth, designed to cover the landing. This castle was founded by <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> and <HI>Hugh the Red</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> in 1098, when
<PB N="249" REF="272"/>
they made an invasion, and committed more savage barbarities on the poor natives, especially on one <HI>Kenred,</HI> a priest, than ever stained the annals of any country. Providence sent <HI>Magnus</HI> king of <HI>Norway</HI> to revenge the cruelties. His coming was to all appearance casual. He offered to land, but was opposed by the earls. <HI>Magnus</HI> stood in the prow of his ship, and, calling to him a most expert bowman, they at once directed their arrows at the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> who stood all armed on the shore. An arrow pierced his brain through one of his eyes, the only defenceless part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Terfaei Hist.

<P>THIS fort was garrisoned fo lately as the time of <HI>Charles</HI> I; when it was kept for the parlement by Sir <HI>Thomas Cheadle;</HI> but was taken by Colonel <HI>Robinson</HI> in 1645 or 6<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Plâs Gwyn MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile farther I visited the Priory of <HI>Penmon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PENMON PRIORY</NOTE> placed, like the former, on the shore. The remains are the ruinous refectory, and the church; part of the last is in present use. Within is a small monument, informing us that Sir <HI>Thomas Wil∣ford,</HI> of <HI>Ildington</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> (one of whose daughters married Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley</HI>) died <HI>January</HI> 25th, 1645. About a mile from the shore is the little island of <HI>Priestholm, St. Seiriol,</HI> or <HI>Glannauch,</HI> which perhaps might have been the principal resi∣dence of the religious, for the priory goes under both names: usually they were called <HI>Canonici de insula Glannauch</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Monast. <HI>ii. 338.</HI></NOTE>. Pro∣bably part might reside on the main land, to look after their

property, and others be engaged in acts of devotion in their retirement. The only remains of their residence is a square tower; but abundance of human bones scattered up and down, are strong proofs of its reputed sanctity, and the superstitious wish of people to have this made the place of their interment. The first recluses of this island, according to <HI>Giraldus,</HI> were hermits; of whom (as usual) he tells a superstitious tale, that whenever they disagreed, they were plagued with swarms of mice; which quitted them as soon as they had layed aside their animosity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Girald, Itin. Cambr. <HI>lib. ii. c. 6. p. 868.</HI></NOTE> Their successors were black monks, dedicated to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> endowed, if not founded, by <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth,</HI> before the year 1221<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tavner,</HI> 699.</NOTE> The Prior was one of the three spi∣ritual lords of <HI>Anglesey.</HI> At the dissolution the revenues were valued at 47<HI>l.</HI> 15<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> in the whole, or 40<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 9<HI>d.</HI> clear; granted in the 6th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>John More.</HI></P>
<P>THE channel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIESTHOLM.</NOTE> or, as it is called, the <HI>Sound,</HI> between the main land and <HI>Priestholm</HI> is very deep, and is the common passage for ships to and from the road of <HI>Beaumaris.</HI> On the other side is the <HI>East passage,</HI> which, at low-water, is between the island and the point of <HI>Traeth Telaven,</HI> little more than a quarter of a mile broad, and navigable for only very small vessels. The island is about a mile long, extremely lofty, and bounded by precipices, except on the side opposite to <HI>Penmon,</HI> and even there the ascent is very steep. The land slopes greatly from the summit to the edge of the precipices. During part of summer the whole swarms with birds of passage. The slope on the side is animated with the PUFFIN AUKS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PUFFINS.</NOTE> <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 232.
<PB N="251" REF="274"/>
which incessantly squall round you, alight, and disappear into their burrows; or come out, stand erect, gaze at you in a most grotesque manner, then take flight, and either perform their evolutions about you, or seek the sea in search of food.</P>
<P>THEY appear first about the fifth, or tenth of <HI>April;</HI> but quit the place, almost to a bird, twice or thrice before they settle. Their first employ is the forming of burrows; which falls to the share of the males, who are so intent on the business as to suffer themselves at that time to be taken by the hand. Some few save themselves the trouble of forming holes, and will dis∣possess the rabbits; who, during the Puffin season, retire to the other side of the island.</P>
<P>THEY lay one white egg. Males, as well as females, per∣form the office of sitting, relieving each other when they go to feed. The young are hatched in the beginning of <HI>July.</HI> The parents have the strongest affection for them; and if layed hold of by the wings, will give themselves most cruel bites on any part of the body they can reach, as if actuated by des∣pair: and when released, instead of flying away, will often hurry again into the burrow to their young. The noise they make when caught is horrible, and not unlike the efforts of a dumb person to speak. This affection ceases at the time of re∣migration, which is most exactly about the eleventh, of <HI>August.</HI> They then go off, to a single bird, and leave behind the un∣fledged young of the later hatches a prey to the Peregrine Fal∣con, which watches the mouth, of the holes for their ap∣pearance, compelled as they must soon be by hunger to come out.</P>
<P>THE food of these birds is sprats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE> or sea-weeds, which makes

<PB N="252" REF="276"/>them excessively rank; yet the young are pickled, and pre∣served by spices, and by some people much admired.</P>
<P>IT appears certain that the Puffins do not breed till their third year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR BILLS. CHANGE IN.</NOTE> The proof arises from the observations made by the reverend Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> on the different forms of the bills, among the thousands of this species which he saw wrecked, as I have mentioned in page 192. He remarked them in their several periods of life. Those which he supposes to have been of the first year, were small, weak, destitute of any furrow, and of a dusky color; those of the second year, were considera∣bly larger and stronger, lighter colored, and with a faint vestige of the furrow at the base; those of more advanced years, were of the vivid colors, and great strength. Among the myriads which annually resort to <HI>Priestholm,</HI> not an individual has ever been observed which had not its bill of an uniform growth. Per∣haps the same remark may hold good in respect to the RAZOR-BILL, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 230, Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> having found multi∣tudes with bills far inferior in strength to those which haunt the island; of an uniform black color, and without the cha∣racteristic white furrow, and black grooves.</P>
<P>The channel between <HI>Priestholm</HI> and <HI>Anglesey</HI> has produced some very uncommon fish.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH.</NOTE> The <HI>Beaumaris</HI> SHARK, <HI>Br. Zool</HI> iii.

The <HI>Iris Foeti∣dissima,</HI> or stinking <HI>Gladwin,</HI> is common about the square tower, and is frequently made into a poultice with oatmeal, and used by the country people with success in the quincy.</P>
<P>I RETURNED to <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> and from thence visited <HI>Baron-Hill.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BARON-HILL.</NOTE> The seat of Lord <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> placed at the head of an extensive lawn sloping down to the town, backed and winged by woods, which are great embellishments to the country. The founder of <HI>Baron-Hill</HI> was Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley,</HI> a most dis∣tinguished personage of the name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I will not here break in on my Tour with his history; but, as it may merit the reader's attention, I refer him to the <HI>Appendix.</HI></NOTE>. He built it in 1618: be∣fore that time the residence of the family was at <HI>Court Mawr</HI> in the subjacent town, and afterwards in another house, called <HI>Old Place.</HI> The present seat has of late been wholly altered, with excellent taste, by its noble owner, by the advice of that elegant architect Mr. <HI>Samuel Wyat.</HI></P>
<P>THE view is justly the boast of the island. The sea forms a most magnificent bay, with the <HI>Menai</HI> opening into it with the grandeur of an <HI>American</HI> river. The limit of the water in front is a semicircular range of rocks and mountains, the chief of <HI>Snowdonia,</HI> with tops spiring to the clouds, and their bottoms richly cultivated, sloping gently to the water edge. The great promontory <HI>Penmaen Mawr,</HI> and the enormous mass of <HI>Llan∣dudno,</HI> are rude but strinking features, and strong contrasts to the softer parts of the scenery.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="278"/>I PROCEEDED on my journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CROMLECH.</NOTE> and at <HI>Trevawr</HI> passed by a great and rude <HI>Cromlech,</HI> with the ruins of others adjacent.

He was painted by Mrs. <HI>Mary Beale,</HI> when he was bishop of <HI>Bangor;</HI> and is re∣presented in lawn sleeves, with dark hair, and a good counte∣nance. The other prelate is <HI>Robert Morgan,</HI> who died bishop of the same diocese in 1673, and is recorded to have been a considerable benefactor to his cathedral. He is dressed like the former; has short grey hair, a close black cap, and hard coun∣tenance.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Plâs Gwyn</HI> I made an excursion to <HI>Traeth Coch,</HI> or <HI>Redwharf,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">REDWHARF.</NOTE> a large bay covered with a firm sand; which, on the west side, has so large a mixture of shells, as to be used as a manure in all parts of the island within reasonable distance. On the east side, about three miles from <HI>Plâs Gwyn,</HI> near the shore, are two rounded mounts on each side of a deep gully leading towards <HI>Llanddona</HI> church. These seemed to have been the work of the <HI>Danes,</HI> cast up to protect their vessels in their plundering excursions; a calamity to which, it appears from the writing of our poets, this island was much subject.</P>

post, surrounded by a double row of rude stones with their sharp points uppermost; and in some parts the ramparts are formed of small stones. In the area are vestiges of oval build∣ings: the largest is formed with two rows of flat stones set an end. These had been the temporary habitations of the possessors. It had been a place of vast strength; for, besides the artificial defence, the hill slopes steeply on all sides, and the brink, next to the ramparts, are mostly precipitous. It is worth while to ascend this hill for the sake of the vast prospect; an inter∣mixture of sea, rock, and alps, most savagely great.</P>

<P>I DESCENDED to the church of <HI>Llan-jestyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLAN-JESTYN.</NOTE> remarkable for the tomb of its tutelar saint, St. <HI>Estyn,</HI> or <HI>Jestyn,</HI> son of <HI>Geriant,</HI> a worthy knight of <HI>Arthur</HI>'s round table, slain by the <HI>Saxons</HI> at the siege of <HI>London!</HI> The figure of the saint represents a man with a hood on his head, a great round beard, and whiskers on upper and under lip. He has on a long cloak fastened by a broche: in one hand is a staff with the head of some beast on the top; in the other is a scroll with an inscription: round his long cassock is a sash and long cord. This appears by the in∣scription to have been a votive offering.

<P>OWEN himself was unfortunate.

The length of his second imprisonment does not appear. After a considerable period, high honors were conferred on his two eldest sons, half brothers to the king. In the year 1452, they were both created earls; <HI>Edmund</HI> was made Earl of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and <HI>Jaspar,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke.

<P>OWEN had besides a natural son, called <HI>Dafydd,</HI> knighted by his nephew <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who also bestowed on him in marriage

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the birth of <HI>Owen</HI> was calumniated, he certainly was of very high descent. <HI>Henry</HI> VII. early in his reign, issued a commission to Sir <HI>John Leiaf,</HI> priest, <HI>Gutten Owen,</HI> and a number of others, to make enquiry into his pater∣nal descent; and they, from our <HI>Welsh</HI> chronicles, proved <HI>in∣contestably,</HI> that <Q>he was lineally descended by issue male, saving one woman, from <HI>Brutus</HI> son of <HI>Aeneas</HI> the <HI>Trojan,</HI> and that he was son to <HI>Brute</HI> in fivescore degrees<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See the return of the commission, &amp;c. in <HI>Wynn's Hist. Wales,</HI> 331. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q> I shall drop a little short of this long descent. <HI>Owen Tudor</HI> was as∣suredly of high blood. He was seventh in descent from <HI>Edny∣fed Vychan,</HI> counsellor, and leader of the armies of <HI>Llewelyn</HI> the Great, and a successful warrior against the <HI>English.</HI> His
<Q>Of a noble race was <HI>Shenkin,</HI> of the line of <HI>Owen Tudor.</HI></Q>
<PB N="259" REF="283"/>origin was from <HI>Marchudd,</HI> one of the fifteen tribes. <HI>Ednyfed</HI>'s wife was <HI>Gwenllian,</HI> daughter of <HI>Rhys,</HI> prince of <HI>South Wales:</HI> so that he might boast of two royal descents, and deliver down a posterity not unworthy of the <HI>British</HI> empire.</P>
<P>OWEN must have been the instrument of his own advance∣ment, and have owed it entirely to his personal merit. His grandfather <HI>Tudor ap Gronw</HI> was a man of great valour, a fa∣vorite of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and received from him the honor of knighthood. He died and was buried <HI>September</HI> 19th 1367, and was interred at the friery at <HI>Bangor.</HI> His fourth son <HI>Me∣redydd</HI> was in no higher station than <HI>Scutifer</HI> to the bishop of <HI>Bangor.</HI> Having committed a murder, he fled his country, and lived in exile; during which time his wife was delivered of <HI>Owen,</HI> the subject of these pages. By what means he intro∣duced himself to the <HI>English</HI> court does not appear; most pro∣bable by military services, the usual road to honors in those days.</P>
<P>THE remains of the residence of the <HI>Tudors</HI> are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSE OF PEN∣HYNNYDD.</NOTE> the door of the gateway: part of the house, and the great chimney-piece of the hall, are to be seen in the present farm-house. Some coats of arms, and dates of the building, or time of repairs, are to be seen, with the initial letters of the names of the owners. The <HI>Tudors,</HI> for a considerable space before the ex∣tinction of their race, assumed the name of <HI>Owen. Richard</HI> was the last male of the family, and was sheriff of the county in 1657. <HI>Margaret,</HI> heiress of the house, married <HI>Coningshy Williams,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Glan y gors,</HI> in this island, who possessed it during his life. It was afterwards sold to Lord <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> in whose descendant in still continues.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="284"/>IN the church of <HI>Penmynydd</HI> is a most magnificent monument of white alabaster, removed at the dissolution from the abbey of <HI>Llanvaes</HI> to this place; probably erected in memory of one of the house of <HI>Tudor,</HI> who had been interred there. On it is the figure of a man in complete armour, a conic helm, and mail∣gaurd down to his breast. His lady is in a thick angular hood. Their feet rest on lions.

<P>ABOUT a mile farther, I visited <HI>Tre-garnedd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE-GARNEDD.</NOTE> a farm-house, in the parish of <HI>Llangesni,</HI> once the site of the great <HI>Ednyfed Vy∣chan,</HI> mentioned in a preceding page.

Among them was Sir <HI>Grayffydd Llwyd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR GRYFFYDD LIWYD.</NOTE> son of <HI>Rhys ap Grayffyd ap Ednyfed Vychan.</HI> This gentleman received from <HI>Edward</HI> I. the honor of knighthood, on bringing him the news of the birth of his son <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Caernarvon.</HI> He did homage, for his lands in <HI>Wales,</HI> to the young prince at <HI>Chester;</HI> but, indignant at the sufferings of his countrymen under the <HI>English</HI> yoke, meditated a revolt. Between the years 1316 and 1318, his attempted to form an alliance with <HI>Edmund Bruce,</HI> the short-lived king of

At length was subdued, taken, and doubtlessly underwent the common fate of our gallant insurgents. I find that he had fortified his house at <HI>Tre-garnedd</HI> with a very strong foss and rampart, and made another strong hold about three quarters of a mile distant, in the morass of <HI>Maltraeth,</HI> called <HI>Ynys Ce∣venni;</HI> which he insulated, by bringing round it the waters of the river <HI>Cefni</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rowlands' MSS.</NOTE>: both are still remaining. The foss is nearly perfect, and near four yards deep and eitht wide. His daughter <HI>Morvydd,</HI> one of his coheiresses<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>, conveyed by marriage this estate, being her protion, to <HI>Madog Gloddaeth;</HI> which followed the succession of that house till 1750, when it was alienated by the late Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn</HI> to Mr. <HI>Owen Williams.</HI></P>
<P>THE name of this place is taken from an immense <HI>Carnedd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT CARNEDD.</NOTE> or heap of stones, surrounded with great upright stones, in an adjacent field. It seems to have beneath it passages formed on the sides and tops with flat stones, or flags. These were the repositories of the dead<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Borlase's Cornwal,</HI> p. 207. tab. xvii. fig. i. iii. and his <HI>Scilly Islands,</HI> 29, 30. tab. ii. at p. 19.</NOTE> Not that bones or urns are also discovered in them; for the founders, like those of the pyramids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> appear often to be disappointed in their hopes of having their reliques lodged in these labored <HI>Mausoleums.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="286"/>A FEW years ago, beneath a carnedd similar to that at <HI>Tre∣garnedd,</HI> was discovered, on a farm called <HI>Bryn-celli-ddu,</HI> near the feat of Sir <HI>Nicholas Bayley,</HI> a passage three feet wide, four feet two or three inches high, and about nineteen feet and a half long, which led into a room, about three feet in diameter, and seven in height. The form was an irregular hexagon, and the sides composed of six rude slabs, one of which measured in its dia∣gonal eight feet nine inches. In the middle was an artless pillar of stone, four feet eight inches in circumference. This sup∣ports the roof, which consists of one great stone, near ten feet in diameter. Along the sides of the room was, if I may be allowed the expression, a stone bench, on which were found human bones, which fell to dust almost at a touch: it is pro∣bable that the bodies were originally placed on the bench. There are proofs that it was customary with the <HI>Gauls</HI> to place their dead in that form in cells; but they added to the head of each body a stone weapon, which served as a pillow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Religion de Gaulois, <HI>ii. 312. plate 42.</HI></NOTE>: but nothing of the king was discovered in this sepulchre.

<P>I MUST not omit mention of the great patriarch of <HI>Tregaian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PATRIARCH OF TREGAIAN.</NOTE> a chapelry of this parish, who lived in the year 1580, and died at the age of 105; his name was <HI>William ap Howel ap Jerwerth.</HI> He had by his first wife twenty-two children, by his second, ten, by his third, four, and by his two concubines seven; in all forty-three. His eldest son was eithty-four in 1581, and his eldest

daughter seventy-two; and his youngest son then only two years and a half old: so that between his first child and last there was an interval of eighty-two years. Nor did there less than three hundred people descend from this stock in that in∣terval, eighty of whom lived in this parish. He was small of statute, of a chearful convivial temper; but spare in his diet, living mostly on milk. He passed his time in rural employ∣ments, and at his leisure in fishing and fowling; and preserved his memory and senses to the last.</P>
<P>I RETURNED to <HI>Plâs Gwyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL-MAWR.</NOTE> and from thence crossed <HI>Red∣wharf,</HI> to the western horn of the bay called <HI>Castell-mawr,</HI> a small cape, flat at top, and joined to the land by a low isthmus. It is composed of lime-stone, which is carried to distant parts in small vessels, which lie in a small channel near the rock, and by their numbers frequently enliven the view. <HI>Roman</HI> coins have been found in this neighborhood; but there are no vestiges of there having been any station.

It is handsomely built, and makes a considerable figure among the churches of this part of <HI>Wales.</HI> It is dedicated to St. <HI>Elian,</HI> surnamed <HI>Gannaid,</HI> or the Bright. He was formerly a most popular saint, and had a great concourse of devotees, who implored his assist∣ance to relieve them from variety of disorders. To gain his favor they made considerable offerings, which were deposited in the church in <HI>Cyff Aelian,</HI> or St. <HI>Aelian</HI>'s chest. These amounted to so large a sum, that the parishioners purchased with it three tenements, for the use of the church, which belong to the living to this day.</P>
<P>NEAR this place, <HI>Caswallon Law-hîr,</HI> or <HI>Caswallon Longima∣nus,</HI> kept his <HI>Llys,</HI> or court.

<P><PB N="265" REF="289"/>FROM hence I visited <HI>Trysclwyn</HI> mountain; on part of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PARYS MOUN∣TAIN.</NOTE> called <HI>Parys mountain</HI> (probably from a <HI>Robert Parys,</HI> who was chamberlain of <HI>North Wales</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was another of the same name in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III.</NOTE> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV.) is the most considerable body of copper ore perhaps ever known. The external aspect of the hill is extremely rude, and rises into enormous rocks of coarse white quartz. The ore is lodged in a bason, or hollow, and has on one side a small lake, on whose waters, distasteful as those of <HI>Avernus,</HI> no bird is known to alight. The whole aspect of this tract has, by the mi∣neral operations, assumed a most savage appearance. Suffocating fumes of the burning heaps of copper arise in all parts, and extend their baneful influence for miles around. In the adja∣cent parts vegetation is nearly destroyed; even the mosses and lichens of the rocks have perished: and nothing seems capable of resisting the fumes but the purple <HI>Melic</HI> grass<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melica Caerulea, Lightfoot, Fl. Scot. <HI>i. 96.</HI> Aira Caerulea, Hudson, Fl. Angl. <HI>i. 33.</HI></NOTE>, which flou∣rishes in abundance.</P>
<P>I HAVE little doubt but that the ore had been worked in a very distant period. Vestiges of the antient operations appear in several parts, carried on by trenching, and by heating the rocks intensely, then suddenly pouring on water, so as to cause them to crack, or scale; thus aukwardly supplying the use of gunpowder<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Tour in Wales, <HI>i. 52.</HI></NOTE> Pieces of charcoal were also found, which prove that wood was made use of for that purpose. As the <HI>Britons</HI> im∣proted all works in brass, it is certain that the <HI>Romans</HI> were the undertakers of these mines; and it is very probable that they sent the ore to <HI>Caerbén</HI> to be smelted, the place where the famous
<PB N="266" REF="290"/>
cake of copper was discovered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tour in Wales, <HI>p. 72. tab. ix.</HI></NOTE>. They might likewise have had a smelting-hearth in this island; for a round cake of copper was discovered at <HI>Llanvaethlle,</HI> a few miles from this place. Its weight was fifty pounds, and it had on it a mark resembling an <HI>L.</HI></P>
<P>IN the year 1762, one <HI>Alexander Frazier</HI> came into <HI>Anglesey</HI> in search of mines. He visited <HI>Parys mountain;</HI> called on Sir <HI>Nicholas Bayley,</HI> and gave him so flattering an account of the prospect, as induced him to make a trial, and sink shafts. Ore was discovered; but before any quantity could be gotten, the mines were overpowered with water. In about two years after, Messrs. <HI>Roe</HI> and Co. of <HI>Macclesfield</HI> applied to Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> for a lease of <HI>Penrhyn ddu</HI> mine in <HI>Caernarvonshire;</HI> with which they were, much against their wills, compelled to take a lease of part of this mountain, and to carry on a level, and make a fair trial. The trial was accordingly made: ore was discovered; but the expences overbalanced the profits. They continued working to great loss: and at length determined to give the affair up. They gave their agent orders for that purpose; but he, as a final attempt, divided his men into ten several com∣panies, of three or four in a partnership, and let them sink shafts in various places, about eight hundred yeards eastward of a place called the <HI>Golden Venture,</HI> on a presumption that a spring, which issued from near the place, must come from a body of mineral. His conjecture was right; for in less than two days they met with, at the depth of seven feet from the surface, the solid mineral, which proved to be that vast body which has since been worked to such advantage. The day that this discovery was made was <HI>March</HI> 2d 1768; which has
<PB N="267" REF="291"/>
ever since been observed as a festival by the miners. Soon after this discovery, another adventure was begun by the reverend Mr. <HI>Edward Hughes,</HI> owner of part of the mountain, in right of his wife <HI>Mary Lewis</HI> of <HI>Llys Dulas;</HI> so that the whole of the treasure is the property of Sir <HI>Nicholas Bayley</HI> and himself.</P>
<P>THE body of copper ore is of unknown extent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE ORE.</NOTE> The thick∣ness has been ascertained, in some places, by the driving of a level under it, several years ago, and it was found to be in some places twenty-four yards. The ore is mostly of the kind called by <HI>Cronsted, Pyrites cupri flavo viridescens;</HI> and contains vast quantities of sulphur. It varies in degrees of goodness; some of it is rich, but the greater part poor in quality.</P>
<P>THERE are other species of copper ore found here. Of late a vein of the <HI>Pyrites cupri griseus</HI> of <HI>Cronsted,</HI> about seven yards wide, has been discovered near the west end of the mountain: some is of an iron grey, some quite black; the first contains six∣teen lb. of copper per clb. the last, forty. An ore has been lately found, in form of loose earth, of dark purplish color; and the best of it has produced better thatn eight in twenty. Some years ago, above thirty pounds of native copper was found in driving a level through a turbery; some was in form of moss, some in very thin leaves.</P>
<P>IT is quarried out of the bed in vast masses; is broken into small pieces; and the most pure part is sold raw, at the rate of about 3<HI>l.</HI> to 6<HI>l.</HI> per ton, or sent to the smelting-houses of the respective companies to be melted into metal. Mr. <HI>Hughes</HI> has great furnaces of his own at <HI>Ravenhead,</HI> near <HI>Leverpool,</HI> and at <HI>Swansey,</HI> in <HI>South Wales.</HI> An idea of the wealth of these mines may be formed, by considering that the <HI>Macclesfield</HI> com∣pany
<PB N="268" REF="292"/>
have had at once fourteen thousand tons of ore upon bank, and Mr. <HI>Hughes</HI>'s, thirty thousand.</P>
<P>THE more impure ore is also broken to the size of about hen's eggs; but in order to clear it from the quantity of sul∣phur with which it abounds, as well as other advantitious mat∣ter, it must undergo the operation of burning. For that pur∣pose it is placed between two parallel walls of vast length: some kilns are twenty, others forty, and fifty yards in length; some ten, others twenty feet wide, and above four feet in height. The space between is not only filled, but the ore is piled many feet higher, in a convex form, from end to end: the whole is then covered with flat stones, closely luted with clay; and above is placed a general integument of clay, and small rubbish of the work, in order to prevent any of the fumes from evaporating. Of late some kilns have been constructed with brick arches over the ore, which is found to be the best method of burning. Within these few years, attempts are made to pre∣serve the sulphur from flying away; and that is done by flues, made of brick, whose tops are in form of a Gothic arch, many scores of feet in length: one end of these opens into the beds of copper which are to be burnt. Those beds are set on fire by a very small quantity of coal, for all the rest is effected by its own <HI>phlogiston.</HI> The volatile part is confined, and diredted to the flues; in its course the sulphurous particles strike against their roofs, and fall to the bottom in form of the finest brimstone;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIMSTONE.</NOTE> which is collected, and carried to adjacent houses, where it is melted into what is called in the shops stone brimstone.</P>
<P>THE beds of copper, thus piled for burning, are of vast ex∣tent. Some contain four hundred tons of ore, others two

thousand. The first require four months to be completely burnt; the last, near ten. Thus burnt, it is carried to proper places to be dressed, or washed, and made merchantable. By this process the ore is reduced to a fourth part in quantity, but considerably improved in quality: and by this means the water is strongly or richly impregnated with copper, which is dissolved by the acid quality of the sulphur; and is collected or precipitated again by iron in the above-described pits. The iron is all dissolved.</P>
<P>BUT a far richer produce of copper is discovered from the water lodged in the bottom of the bed of ore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRECIPITATED COPPER.</NOTE>which is highly saturated with the precious metal. This is drawn up, either by means of whimsies or windmills, to the surface, and then distributed into numbers of rectangular pits thirty-six feet long, some pits more some less, twelve to fifteen feet broad, and twenty inches deep. To speak in the language of the adept, <HI>Venus</HI> must make an assignation with <HI>Mars,</HI> or this solution will have no effect. In plain <HI>English,</HI> a quantity of iron must be immersed in the water. The kind of iron is of no moment; old pots, hoops, anchors, or any refuse will suffice; but of late, for the convenience of management, the adventurers procure new plates, four feet long, one and a half broad, and three quarters of an inch thick. These they immerse into the pits; the particles of copper instantly are precipitated by the iron, and the iron is gradually dissolved into a yellow ocher; great part of it floats off by the water, and sinks to the bottom. The plates, or the old iron (as it happens) are frequently taken out, and the copper scraped off; and this is repeated till the whole of the iron is consumed. The copper thus procured differs
<PB N="270" REF="294"/>
little from native copper, and is prized accordingly, and sold for prices of 25<HI>l.</HI> to 45<HI>l.</HI> a ton.</P>
<P>THIS discovery is far from new; it has been practised long in the <HI>Wicklow</HI> mines in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and above a century in those of <HI>Hern-grundt</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where it is called <HI>Ziment Copper</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brown's travels, <HI>68.</HI> Keysler's travels, <HI>iv. 70.</HI></NOTE> The waters of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> mines are much more strongly impregnated with copper than those of <HI>Parys mountain.</HI> The first effects its operation in twelve or about twenty days; the last requires two months. Horse-shoes, iron made in shape of hearts, and other forms, are put into the foreign waters, and when per∣fectly transmuted, are given as presents to curious strangers.</P>
<P>THE ore is not got in the common manner of mining, but is cut out of the bed in the same manner as stone is out of a quarry. A hollow is now formed in the solid ore open to the day, and extends about and hundred yards in length, about forty yards in breadth, and twenty-four yards in depth. The ends are at present undermined, but supported by vast pillars and mignificent arches, all metallic; and these caverns meander far under ground. These will soon disappear, and thousands of tons of ore be gotten from both the columns and roofs. The sides of this vast hollow are mostly perpendicular, and access to the bottom is only to be had by small steps cut in the ore; and the curious visitor must trust to them and a rope, till he reaches some ladders, which will conduct him the rest of the descent. On the edges of the chasms are wooden platforms, which project far; on them are windlasses, by which the work∣men are lowered to transact their business on the face of the precipice. There suspended, they work in mid air, pick a
<PB N="271" REF="295"/>
small space for a footing, cut out the ore in vast masses, and tumble it to the bottom with great noise. In such situations they form caverns, and there appear safely lodged, till the rope is lowered to convey them up again. Much of the ore is blasted with gunpowder, eight tons of which, I am informed, is an∣nually used for the purpose.</P>
<P>NATURE hath been profuse in bestowing her mineral favors on this spot; for above the copper ore, and not more than three quarters of a yard beneath the common soil, is a bed of yellow∣ish greasy clay, from one to four yards thick, containing lead ore, and yielding from six hundred to a thousand pounds weight of lead from one ton; and one ton of the metal yields not less than fifty-seven ounces of silver. Mixed with the earth, are fre∣quently certain parts of the color of cinnabar: whether these are symptomatic of the sulphurous arsenical silver ores, or of quicksilver, I will not pretend to decide. Something inter∣feres with the successful smelting of this earth in the great: insomuch that it has not yet been of that profit to the adven∣turers, which might reasonably be expected from the crucible assays of it; and they have at this time about eight thousand tons on bank undisposed of. This place has been worked for lead ore in very distant times. In the bottom of the pool was found an antient smelting hearth of grit-stone, and several bits of smelted lead, of about four inches in length, two breadth, and half an inch thick.</P>
<P>THESE works have added greatly to the population of the island; for about fifteen hundred persons are employed, who, with their families, are supposed to make near eight thousand persons, getting their bread from these mines. The little vil∣lage
<PB N="272" REF="296"/>
of <HI>Amlwch,</HI> the port of the place, is encreasing fast, and the market grows considerable. At the season of the greatest work, Mr. <HI>Hughes</HI>'s men alone receive, for many weeks, two hundred pounds in one week, and a hundred and fifty in another, merely for subsistence. The port is no more than a great chasm between two rocks, running far into land, and dry at low-water; into which sloops run, and lie secure to receive their lading.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Parys mountain</HI> I visited the north-west parts of the island, and passed over a sandy plain country, fertile in grain. See to the right, the <HI>Middle Mouse;</HI> and farther on is the third small isle of that name, called the <HI>West Mouse.</HI> Between these, on the coast of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> is <HI>Kemlyn</HI> bay, where there is safe an∣chorage for small vessels. Not far from hence I saw the noted quarry of marble, common to this place, some parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> and to <HI>Corsica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MARBLE QUARRY.</NOTE> and known in the shops by the name of <HI>Verde di Corsica.</HI> Its colors are green, black, white, and dull purple, irregularly disposed. In different blocks one or other of the colors are frequently wanting; but among the green parts are often found narrow veins of a most elegant and silky white <HI>asbestos.</HI> It is a compound species of marble; part is calca∣reous, and may be acted on by aqua fortis. The green parts partake of the nature of jasper. It is apt to be intersected by small cracks, or by asbestine veins, therefore incapable of taking a high polish. This quarry lies on the lands of <HI>Mo∣nach-ty,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Llan-Fair-Ynghornwy;</HI> and it is found again in the isle of <HI>Skerries,</HI> off this parish.</P>
<P>NEITHER the quarry not the asbestos are at present in use. The antients set a high value on the last, a price equal to that of pearls. They wove napkins of it, and at great feasts

diverted themselves (in order to clean them) to fling them into the fire, from which they returned unhurt, and with im∣proved lustre. They likewise made of it shrouds for the bodies of great men, before they were placed on the funeral pile, and by that means preserved their ashes pure from those of the wood. The antients believed that it was found only in <HI>India,</HI> in places where showers never fell, and the residence of dire serpents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plinii, Nat, Hist. <HI>lib. xix. c. 1.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM hence I vesited <HI>Carreg-Lwyd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CARREG-LWYD.</NOTE> then the residence of that worthy and convivial gentleman <HI>Jobn Griffith,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> From thence I made an attempt to sail to the <HI>Skerries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE SKERRIES.</NOTE> called in <HI>Welsh Ynys y Moel Rhoniaid,</HI> or the isle of <HI>Seals,</HI> distant about a league from this place, and about half a league from the nearest part of <HI>Anglesey:</HI> a turbulent sea made us return with speed. The island is very rocky, but affords food for a few Sheep, Rabbits, and Puffins. The light-house, placed on it about the year 1730, is of great use to ships sailing between <HI>Ireland</HI> and the ports of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Leverpool.</HI> The produce from the ton∣nage, about the year 1759, was 1100<HI>l.</HI> a year; of which <HI>Ire∣land</HI> contributed 400<HI>l.

<P>THIS isle formerly belonged to the cathedral of <HI>Bangor,</HI> which clamed an exclusive right of fishing on it. The right of the prelates of that see had been, by some neglect, invaded; and the <HI>Griffiths</HI> of <HI>Penrhyn</HI> had usurped the privilege, by having

<P>FROM <HI>Carreg-Lwyd</HI> I rode to <HI>Holyhead,</HI> about eleven or twelve miles distant. Passed by <HI>Llanfachreth</HI> and <HI>Llanynghenedl</HI> to <HI>Rhyd-Pont</HI> bridge, where a very small river-like channel in∣sulates the great promontory. Go over <HI>Towyn y Capel,</HI> a low sandy common, bounded on one side by rocks, which in high winds the sea breaks over in a most aweful and stupendous manner, and are justly dreaded by mariners.

to the chapel, it had been the site of a small fort; for I never saw atrificial elevations given to any but works of a military kind.

<P>NOT far from hence, between <HI>Bodior</HI> and <HI>Rhyd-Pont,</HI> in <HI>Rhoscolyn</HI> Parish, is a fossil not frequently found. A green ami∣anthus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AMIANTHUS.</NOTE> or brittle asbestos, is met with in great plenty, in a green marble, similar to that at <HI>Monach-ty;</HI> but by reason of the inflexible quality of its fibres, not applicable to the same uses.</P>
<P>WITHIN two miles of <HI>Towyn y Capel</HI> is the town of <HI>Holyhead,</HI> seated on a noted and safe harbour, guarded at its mouth from the winds by <HI>Ynys</HI> GYBI—the island of St. <HI>Gybi</HI>—surnamed <HI>Corineus,</HI> son of <HI>Solomon</HI> Duke of <HI>Cornwal;</HI> who, after studying some years in <HI>Gaul,</HI> returned to <HI>Britain,</HI> and fixed his see at the place called now <HI>Caer Gybi,</HI> and <HI>Holyhead</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cressy's Ch.

<P><PB N="277" REF="301"/>NEAR the church stood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ECLWYS Y BEDD.</NOTE> in old times, a chapel called <HI>Eglwys y Bedd,</HI> or the church of the Grave; and <HI>Capet Llan y Gwyddel,</HI> or the chapel of the <HI>Irishman.

<P>THE precinct of the church-yard clames a far higher anti∣quity than the church.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN FORT.</NOTE> It is a square of two hundred and twenty feet by a hundred and thirty. Three sides are strong walls, seventeen feet high, and six feet thick; the fourth side is open to the precipitous rocks of the harbour, and never had been walled, being intended for ships to retire to, and receive the benefit of protection from this inclosure. At each corner of the wall is an oval tower. The masonry of the whole is evidently <HI>Roman:</HI> the mortar very hard, and mixed with much coarse peb∣ble. Along the walls are two rows of round holes, about four inches in diameter, which penetrate them. They are in all respects like those at <HI>Segontium,</HI> p. 220, and nicely plaistered within.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="302"/>THE use of this harbour to the <HI>Romans,</HI> in the passage from various places to the ports of <HI>Lancashire</HI> and that of <HI>Chester,</HI> is very evident. They could not find a better place to run into, in case of hard weather, than this, as it projected farthest into the <HI>Vergivian</HI> sea; so that they could make it with less danger of being embayed than in any other place. If (as is very probable) they had commerce with <HI>Ireland,</HI> no place was better adapted. The <HI>Romans,</HI> it is true, never made a settle∣ment in that country, but they certainly traded with it, even in the time of <HI>Agricola,</HI> <Q>when its ports and harbours were better known, from the concourse of merchants for the pur∣poses of commerce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacitus, Vitae Agricola.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I TOOK a walk from the town to the top of <HI>The Head,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE HEAD.</NOTE> in search of other antiquities. In my way, saw the ruins of <HI>Capel y Gorlles,</HI> one of several which are scattered about this holy promontory. On the side which I ascended, my course was in∣terrupted with a huge dry wall, in many places regularly faced, and ten feet high in some of the most entire parts, and fur∣nished with an entrance. On the <HI>Pen y Gaer Gybi,</HI> or the sum∣mit of the mountain, are foundations of a circular building, strongly cemented with the same sort of mortar as the sort in the town. It seems to have been, a <HI>Pharos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A PHAROS.</NOTE> a necessary director in these seas.</P>
<P>FROM the top of this mountain I had a distinct view of the isle of <HI>Holyhead:</HI> it being at that time high-water, and the channel filled on each side of <HI>Rhyd-Pont</HI> bridge. The isle is of unequal breadth, and greatly indented.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="303"/>THE part of the <HI>Head</HI> fronting the sea, is either an immense precipice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> or hollowed into most magnificent caves.

Their eggs are sought after for food; and are gotten by means of a man, who is lowered down by a rope held by one or more per∣sons. Within memory, the person let down, by his weight overpowered the other, and pulled him down; so that both pe∣rished miserably.</P>

<P>THE house of friers preachers stood a little way out of the town.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRIERY.</NOTE> It was founded as early as the year 1276: Bishop <HI>Tan∣ner</HI> gives the honor of it to <HI>Tudor ap Gronw,</HI> lord of <HI>Penmynnydd</HI> and <HI>Trecastell</HI> in <HI>Anglesey,</HI> who enlarged or rebuilt it in 1299, and was interred here in 1311. <HI>Edward</HI> VI. made a grant of the place to <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> and <HI>William Breton.</HI> Soon after, it was converted into a free school by <HI>Jeffry Glynn,</HI> LL.

<PB N="283" REF="307"/>By his will, proved <HI>July</HI> 21st 1557, he left the conduct of it to his brother, and to <HI>Maurice Gryffydd</HI> bishop of <HI>Rochester.</HI> They dying before the settlement could be completed, left their power to Sir <HI>William Petre,</HI> and others; who agreed on the statutes for the master and usher, with the concurrence of the bishop, dean, and chapter, and of <HI>Alexander Nowel,</HI> dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, who is said to have composed them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willis.</NOTE>.

<P>HUGH Lupus, in his barbarous inroad into <HI>Anglesey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> founded a castle at <HI>Bangor,</HI> in order to carry on his ravages with greater security<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS. <HI>in vita</HI> Gryffydd ap Knan.</NOTE>. The site was wholly unknown, till it was pointed out to me by the reverend Mr. <HI>E. R. Owen,</HI> a gentleman to whom this part of the work is under frequent obligations. It lies nearly a quarter of a mile eastward of the town, on the ridge of hills which bound the south-east side of the vale, and nearly the same distance from the port. The castle stood on a rocky, and, in many parts, a precipitous hill. Three sides of the walls are easily to be traced: on the south-east side they extended a hundred and twenty yards; on the south-west, sixty-six, ending at a precipice; the north-east may be traced forty yards, and ends in the same manner. On the fourth side, the natural strength of the place rendered a farther defence useless. Mounds of earth tending to a semicircular form, with rocks and precipices, connect the north-east and south-west walls.
<PB N="284" REF="308"/>
We know not the time of its demolition: probably as soon as the earl had effected his design, it was suffered to fall to ruin.</P>
<P>ON leaving <HI>Bangor</HI> I took the road towards <HI>Conway.</HI> At a small distance from the former, crossed <HI>Aber Cegid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ABER CEGID.</NOTE> a small creek, fordable at low-water; from whence are annually im∣ported many millions of slates. A little farther, on the sum∣mit of a hill commanding a most charming view, stands <HI>Pen∣rhyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PENRHYN.</NOTE> an antient house, once beautifully embosomed with vene∣rable oaks. The house is said to have been built on the site of a palace of <HI>Roderic Mwlwynog,</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who began his reign in 720. It continued long in our princes. In 987 it was levelled to the ground by <HI>Meredydd ap Owen;</HI> who, in that year, invaded <HI>North Wales,</HI> and slew <HI>Cadwallon ap Jewaf,</HI> the reigning prince. In the time of <HI>Llewelyn</HI> the Great, it was bestowed, with the whole hundred of <HI>Llechwedd Ucha,</HI> on <HI>Yard∣dur ap Trabaiarn,</HI> a man of rank at that period. <HI>Eva,</HI> or as she is called by some <HI>Enerys,</HI> one of his descendants, who had, by the customary division of the lands by gavel-kind, <HI>Penrhyn</HI> to her share, bestowed it, with her person, on <HI>Gryffydd ap Heilin ap Sir Tudor ap Ednyved Vychan,</HI> originally lord of <HI>Bryn Ffanigl.</HI> The family flourished for many generations. <HI>William Vychan,</HI> son of <HI>Gwilim ap Gryffydd,</HI> and <HI>Jonet,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>William Stanley</HI> of <HI>Hooton,</HI> and relict of Judge <HI>Parys,</HI> chamberlain of <HI>North Wales</HI> and <HI>Chester,</HI> succeeded, in the 18th of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. to the estates of his father and the Judge, and also succeeded the last in his important office of chamberlain of <HI>North Wales;</HI> an honor continued to several of his posterity, and at this time possessed by lord viscount <HI>Bulkeley.</HI></P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that in his time the severity of the laws
<PB N="285" REF="309"/>
against the <HI>Welsh</HI> were so rigidly enforced, that he was made denizen of <HI>England,</HI> on condition that he should not marry a <HI>Welsh</HI> woman; and accordingly he married a daughter of a Sir <HI>William,</HI> or Sir <HI>Richard Dalton.</HI></P>
<P>IN the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth, Piers Gryffydd</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He married <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> knight, and had by her three sons, all of whom died young.

His son Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> the last owner who inhabited <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> left three daughters; <HI>Frances,</HI> first married to <HI>Robert Lloyd</HI> of <HI>Ec∣clusham</HI> near <HI>Wrexham,</HI> afterwards to <HI>Edward</HI> lord <HI>Russel,</HI> third
<PB N="286" REF="310"/>
son of the first duke of <HI>Bedford; Anne,</HI> married to <HI>Thomas War∣burton</HI> of <HI>Winnington Cheshire;</HI> and <HI>Gwen,</HI> to Sir <HI>Walter Yonge</HI> of <HI>Devonshire.</HI> Lord <HI>Russel</HI> having no issue, generously resigned his part of the estate to the surviving sisters. Sir <HI>George Yonge,</HI> grandson of the former, sold his moiety to the late <HI>John Pennant,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whose son <HI>Richard Pennant,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> possesses the whole by virtue of his marriage with <HI>Anne Susannah,</HI> daughter and sole heiress of the late General <HI>Warburton</HI> of <HI>Winnington.</HI></P>
<P>THE present buildings stand round a court, and consist of a gateway, chapel, a tower, vast hall, and a few other apart∣ments. By several ruins may be traced its former extent. The house was rebuilt, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. by <HI>Guilim ap Gryffydd.</HI> The <HI>Stanley</HI> arms (those of his wife) empaled with his own, were to be seen in the hall windows, till the year 1764: by the initials R. G. and date 1575, it appears that Sir <HI>Rhys Gryffydd</HI> repaired it in that year. It gives me great satisfaction to find, that the place will soon be restored to its former lustre, under the auspices of the present worthy owners, and on the plan of that able architect Mr. <HI>S. Wynt.</HI></P>
<P>THE only furniture left to this house, which savored of anti∣quity, was the drinking-horn of its hero <HI>Piers Gryffydd;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DRINKING-HORN.</NOTE> out of which I have made libations, in the hospitable reign of the agent Mr. <HI>Richard Hughes.</HI> It was a large bugle, or horn of an ox, enriched with sculptured silver, and with a chain of the same metal. At one end are the initials of his own name, P. G. and those of his father and mother, R. G. K. or <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Ca∣therine Gryffydd.</HI> Such horns were in use with <HI>Danes, Saxons, Scots,</HI> and <HI>Welsh.</HI> We had in old times three species in our royal court, which, by usage, were to be made of those of the
<PB N="287" REF="311"/>
ox. The first was <HI>Y Corn ydd Yfo y</HI> BRENIN, or that allotted for the sole use of the king; the second was <HI>Corn Cyweithas,</HI> or the horn with which the domestics of the palace was to be called; and the third was <HI>y Corny y Pencynydd,</HI> or the horn of the chief huntsman. Each of them was to be worth a pound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leges Walliea, <HI>311.</HI></NOTE>. To drink out of the royal cup, at great entertainments, was a privilege of the officers of the palace. Thus the governor was to receive a cup of metheglin by the hand of the high steward. The same officer was also dispenser of horns of drink to several others; among them, to the royal porter; who at certain seasons had, besides his horn from the king and queen, another from the master of the horse, which was styled <HI>Gwi∣rawd i'r Ebysdyl,</HI> or the <HI>Waissail</HI> cup of the <HI>apostle</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 17. 47.</NOTE>, whom they probably invoked at the time of drinking. This custom was in frequent use in old times. The <HI>Danes</HI> invoked the highest powers to assist the mighty draught: <HI>Help</HI> GOT <HI>unde</HI> MARIA<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Journey to London, <HI>179.</HI></NOTE>. And the <HI>Saxon Ulphus,</HI> when he conveyed certain lands to the church of <HI>York,</HI> quaffed off the horn, DEO <HI>et St. Petro</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Archaelogia, <HI>iii. S.</HI></NOTE>. On less serious occasions, on festive days, the horn was emptied at one tip, and then blown to shew that there was no deceit. The jovial horn was a subject of poetry. Thus <HI>Owen Cyveiliog,</HI> the princely Bard<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">He was prince of <HI>Powis,</HI> and flourished about the year 1160. See the reverend Mr. <HI>Evan Evans's Collections,</HI> p. 7.</NOTE>, celebrates the <HI>Hirlas,</HI> or drirnking-horn used at feasts in his palace. He writes in a more exalted strain, as the poem was composed immediately after a great victory over the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Maelor.</HI> I lay a translation before my reader, by the same elegant pen to which I have been so frequently obliged.</P>

<P>FROM <HI>Penrhyn</HI> I visited the church of <HI>Llandegai,</HI> about a mile distant from the house. It is finely situated on a lofty, bank above the <HI>Ogwen,</HI> and commands a beautiful view. It is a small but neat structure, in form of a cross; with the tower in the center, supported within by four arches. Here is pre∣served an alabaster monument of an armed man, and his lady, recumbent. They probably belonged to the neighboring house; but on the dissolution were removed from the friery of <HI>Llanvaes,</HI> where the persons represented had been interred. A mural monument, with the figure of archbisshop <HI>John Wil∣liams</HI> in his episcopal dress,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARCHBISHOP WILLIAMS.</NOTE> kneeling at an altar, is placed above the remains of that great prelate. He was born at <HI>Conwy.</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="320"/>
His father <HI>Edmund</HI> was sixth son of the neighboring family of <HI>Cwchwillan,</HI> a branch of that of <HI>Penrhyn.</HI> His mother <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of <HI>Owen ap John Owen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pedigree of the family, MS.</NOTE>. The archbishop was fifth son. In his childish years, with other play-fellows, he was di∣verting himself with leaping from part of the walls of <HI>Conwy</HI> down to the shore. The fall was on so critical a part, as ever to secure him from all reproaches of unchastity. I mention this merely to rescue him from the reflections flung on him by that satyrical historian Sir <HI>Anthony Weldon</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoirs.</NOTE>. At school, which was that of <HI>Ruthin,</HI> he was a compound of alternate truantry and industry. His great abilities were soon taken notice of. He entered on public life as chaplain to lord chancellor <HI>Eger∣ton;</HI> and preaching before the king, so pleased the royal ear, that in 1610 <HI>James</HI> made him dean of <HI>Salisbury;</HI> and on far∣ther discovery of his great abilities, in 1620, dean of <HI>West∣minster;</HI> and in 1621, lord keeper, in the room of the illustri∣ous Lord <HI>Bacon;</HI> and in less than a month, nominated him to the see of <HI>Lincoln.</HI> Now placed above restraint, his character be∣gan to unfold. His spirit grew beyond the controul of mini∣sters; for, with undaunted courage, he persisted in all that was right: and, being subject to the failings of his country, (great passion, pride, and vanity) sometimes in what was wrong. He discharged his office, foreign as it was to his profession, with distinguished credit near five years. Soon after the ac∣cession of <HI>Charles</HI> I. by the influence of the favorite <HI>Buckingham,</HI> he was suddenly dismissed: for he always had resisted the un∣reasonable demands of that minion.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="321"/>IN two parts of his conduct I must consider him as a wife but not as a good man:—His advice to his distressed master, in the case of the earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> had too great a share of du∣plicity to be vindicated; perhaps of resentment, for he hated the devoted minister. The spirit of <HI>Machiavel</HI> arose strong in him, when he spoke of a public and private conscience; and still more strongly when he advised <HI>Charles,</HI> in case the king could not gain <HI>Cromwel</HI> by promises of fair treatment, to catch him by some stratagem, and cut him short. He may appear in these instances a great minister, but a bad divine. The infirmity, the inequalities, which may be met in men even of first-rate abilities, may be exemplified in his attempt to defend himself from a frivolous accusation; for he fell into the dis∣graceful crime of subornation of perjury, was censured in the star-chamber, and suffered imprisonment from 1637 to 1640. On his release, irritated against the court, he for a time joined the popular leaders. Let me attribute this (and candor may admit the cause) to the natural violence of his temper; for on all trying occasions he shewed his zeal for the liberty of the subject, and his sincerity to his order. Soon after this, he was, according to an old promise, promoted to the see of <HI>York.</HI> He was a firm friend to the <HI>petition of right</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drake's Parliam. Hist. <HI>viii. 146.</HI></NOTE>, foreseeing that he served both king and people in the support of it. As a friend to the church, he was so successful an advocate, and shewed such eloquence and strength of reasoning, in the debate in <HI>May</HI> 1641, on taking away the votes of bishops in the house of lords<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, ix, 334.</NOTE>, as to cause the affair to be dropped for that sessions.
<PB N="297" REF="322"/>
In the latter end of the year, when popular fury ran high, he was attacked in <HI>Westminster</HI> abbey; and with great courage re∣pelled the violence of the mob. This gave rise to the first satyrical political print I know. The prelate is represented in his episcopal dress, a musket on his shoulder, rest in his hand, helmet on his head, and mitre on the ground. The rage of the common people increased, even so far as to seize him in his way to the house of lords, and to tear his robes from his back. Incensed at this, he returned to <HI>Westminster</HI> abbey (the deanery of which he had been allowed to hold three years in <HI>commendam</HI>) and, in a fit of passion, induced eleven bishops to join him in a phrenetic protest against all acts that should be done in the house of lords during their forced absence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, <HI>ii. 350.</HI></NOTE>. This brought an impeachment of high-treason against them, imprisonment of eighteen months, and in the end a release upon bail, in which the archbishop in particular was bound not to go into his diocese during the disturbances in the county of <HI>York</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Drake's Parliam. Hist. <HI>x. 483.</HI></NOTE>. He instantly disobeyed the injunction, followed the king into the city of <HI>York,</HI> was enthroned there on <HI>June</HI> 27th 1642; but immediately driven away by the <HI>Hothams.</HI> He then retired to his native country, where he finished his days on his birth-day, <HI>March</HI> 25th 1650, aged 68. He died at <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> the seat of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> an eminent loyalist; whose lady warned him of the approach of death, the stroke of which he received with exemplary piety, courage, and resignation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philips's Life of archbishop Williams,</HI> 305.

<P><PB N="298" REF="323"/>FROM <HI>Llandegai</HI> I descended, and crossed the wooden bridge over the furious torrent <HI>Ogwen,</HI> which, a little lower, discharges itself into the sea at <HI>Aber-ogwell;</HI> and near which is the ruin of the old chapel, <HI>Capel Ogwen,</HI> and certain entrenchments, defences of this part of the country. I soon quitted the great road to visit <HI>Carnedd Llewelyn</HI> and <HI>Carnedd Dafydd.</HI> In my way, near a field called <HI>Car Gwilim Ddu,</HI> is an artificial cave, in which (tradition says) was interred <HI>William de Breos,</HI> exe∣cuted, by <HI>Llewelyn</HI> the Great, on suspicion of too great fami∣liarity with his royal consort. From hence I begin a steep ascent, and leave on the left the vast mountain <HI>Moelwynnion,</HI> and the strange ferrated rocks <HI>Bere Mawr</HI> and <HI>Bere Bach.</HI> The <HI>Gern</HI> appeared on our right, and <HI>Trwsgwl</HI> in front. On the right, farther on, projected into the bottom the lofty peaked <HI>Moel yr Elain,</HI> or the naked hill <HI>of the Fawn,</HI> seeming like a buttress to <HI>Carnedd Llewelyn;</HI> and between it and <HI>Carnedd Da∣fydd</HI> lies the little vale of <HI>Cwm Penllafar,</HI> fertile in grass.

<P><PB N="299" REF="324"/>NANT FRANKON is a tremendous glen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NANT FRANKON.</NOTE> or rather chasm, bounded by these and other lofty rocks.

Over part of this vale impends <HI>Yr Oleu Wen,</HI> with its front torn into amazing gullies, through which torrents of stones were some time before carried into the <HI>Nant,</HI> by the single collision of a cloud which burst against it, discharging an ocean of water. The ruins of the hill looked like a stream of <HI>lava;</HI> which providentially divided above a house, and by that means gave safety to the inhabitants. Among the ruins were stones filled with innumerable small brassy cubic <HI>pyritae.</HI> I must not omit, that the passage through this dreary bottom was once defended by a fort, about a mile from the <HI>Benglog,</HI> called <HI>Ty'n y Twr,</HI> close to a bridge called <HI>Pont y Twr;</HI> but at present there is not a vestige to be seen.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Menai, Anglesey,</HI> and the river <HI>Conway,</HI> afforded a distinct and fine prospect. The high hills east of <HI>Nant Conway</HI> ap∣peared a mere undulated tract; a proof of our lofty situation.

<P><PB N="302" REF="327"/>CONTINUE my ride towards the shore, towards <HI>Aber,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ABER.</NOTE> a small village with a church, in the gift of Lord <HI>Bulkeley;</HI> seated at the mouth of a deep glen, which runs straight a mile and a half between the mountains, and bounded on one side by a magni∣ficent rock, called <HI>Maes y Gaer.</HI> One part is hid with trees; on the other they only sprinkle its grey surface. At the ex∣tremity of this glen a mountain presents a concave front, in the center of which a vast cataract precipitates down a double fall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASCADE.</NOTE> The lowest is of a very great height, and forms partly a broad white sheet, partly a snowy dew, not unlike the <HI>Staub∣hauch,</HI> or <HI>dusty</HI> cascade, in <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>AT the entrance of the glen, close to the village, is a very large artificial mount, flat at top, and near sixty feet in diame∣ter, widening towards the base. It was once the site of a castle belonging to <HI>Llewelyn</HI> the Great. Some foundations are yet to be seen round the summit, and in digging, traces of buildings have been discovered. In this place was detected the intrigue of <HI>William de Breos</HI> (son of <HI>Reginald,</HI> a potent baron in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III.) with the wife of <HI>Llewelyn.</HI> It seems that <HI>William,</HI> by chance of war, had before fallen into the hands of our prince, at which time probably the familiarity with the princess commenced; but was not discovered till after he was released on a large ransom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Baron, <HI>i. 419.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>I CONTINUED my journey from <HI>Aber</HI> along the rich recess, en∣joying a fine view of the entrance into the <HI>Menai,</HI> with its wooded shores of <HI>Anglesey</HI> and <HI>Priestholm</HI> isle, and the great expanse of water between them and <HI>Llandudno,</HI> or <HI>Ormshead:</HI> the vast cape rising, like the rock of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> high out of the waves. Before me soared the great promontory of PENMAEN MAWR, protruding itself into the sea, and exhibiting a fine contrast to the fertility which it interrupts, by a rude view of grey weather-beaten stone and precipice. I passed by <HI>Bryn y Neuodd,</HI> a house late the property of <HI>Humphrey Roberts,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> now of his daughter and sole heiress, relict of <HI>Robert Wynne,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of
<PB N="304" REF="329"/>
<HI>Plâsnewydd,</HI> near <HI>Denbigh.</HI> A little farther is the small vil∣lage and church of <HI>Llanvair Vechan;</HI> from whence is a very short ride to the once tremendous road over this celebrated rock.</P>
<P>IN past times it was justly the terror of the traveller;<NOTE PLACE="marg">PENMAEN MAWR.</NOTE> ex∣tremely narrow, bad, and stoney; and what added to his fears, for a considerable way the danger encreased with his progress, by reason of the precipice gaining additional height. Generally it was without the protection of a wall to secure him in case of a false step; which might in the loftiest place precipitate him some scores of yards, either on sharp rocks or into the sea according to the state of the tide. A vein of a crumbling stratum, in one part so contracted the road as to excite new hor∣rors. The <HI>British</HI> parlement eased the fears of the travellers by a generous aid; which, by means of the judicious employ∣ment of JOHN SYLVESTER, about the year 1772, effected what was before thought beyond the reach of art to remedy. The road is now widened to a proper breadth, and near the verge of the precipice secured by a strong wall. The descent towards <HI>Penmaen Bach,</HI> or the <HI>Little Penmaen,</HI> which before was hardly practicable, is now destroyed; and the road is brought on a level for two or three miles, at a vast height above a return of rich slopes, and the deep bottom of <HI>Dwygyfylchig,</HI> till we arrive at the rude back of that lesser promontory; when we labor up the steep ascent of <HI>Sychnant,</HI> with a horrible and almost precipitous mountain on one side, and hills, with tops broken into most singular crags, on the other. From the top of <HI>Sych∣nant,</HI> the road is continued about two miles on a perpetual descent to the town of <HI>Conway.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="330"/>THE breach occasioned by the crumbling stratum, is now effectually repaired by a series of arches; a work the just ad∣miration of travellers, and a high credit to the ingenious con∣triver. One danger yet remains, which must for ever baffle the art of man: the side of this great rock, above the road, breaks into millions of vast masses, depending often on preca∣rious tenures; which, loosened by the frequent torrents, some∣times (though rarely) descend in stoney streams.</P>
<P>Two or three accidents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACCIDENTS THERE.</NOTE> which have happened on this road, will remain as miracles. An exciseman fell from the highest part, and escaped unhurt. The reverend Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who, in 1762, was rector of <HI>Llanelian,</HI> in the isle of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> fell with his horse, and a midwife behind him, down the steepest part. The <HI>sage femme</HI> perished, as did the nag. The divine, with great philosophy, unsaddled the steed, and marched off with the trappings, exulting at his preservation.</P>
<P>I HAVE often heard of another accident, attended with such romantic circumstances that I would not venture to mention it, had I not the strongest traditional authority, to this day in the mouth of every one in the parish of <HI>Llanvair Vechan,</HI> in which this promontory stands. Above a century ago, <HI>Siôn Humphries</HI> of this parish had made his addresses to <HI>Anne Thomas</HI> of <HI>Creyd∣dyn,</HI> on the other side of <HI>Conway</HI> river. They had made an appointment to meet at a fair in the town of <HI>Conway.</HI> He in his way fell over <HI>Penmaen Mawr:</HI> she was overset in the ferry-boat, and was the only person saved out of more than fourscore. They were married, and lived very long together in the parish of <HI>Llanvair.</HI> She was buried <HI>April</HI> 11th 1744, aged 116. He survived her five years, and was buried <HI>December</HI> 10th 1749;
<PB N="306" REF="331"/>
was buried close by her in the parish church-yard, where their graves are familiarly shewn to this day.</P>
<P>I HAVE more than once visited the summit of this noted rock, to view the fortifications described by the editor of <HI>Cambden,</HI> from some notes of that sensible old baronet Sir <HI>John Wynn</HI> of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> and have found his account very just<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> ii. 804, &amp; seq. Before Sir <HI>John Wynn,</HI> a Sir <HI>Thomas ap Wil∣liam,</HI> medicus, M. A. had described it; but his account never appeared in print. He was eighth son of one of the family of <HI>Cochwillan.</HI> Lived in the year 1594, and is said to have resided at <HI>Trefriw.</HI></NOTE>. The ascent is laborious. Soon after leaving the inn, I met with the ruins of St. <HI>Seiriol</HI>'s chapel, or, as it is here called, his <HI>Gweli,</HI> or bed; and after passing a considerable way amidst small trees and brush-wood, attain the bare and stoney part, or the <HI>Braich y Ddinas,</HI> (i. e. the arm of the city) which rises in form of another hill out of this promontory. A Mr. <HI>Caswel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS HEIGHT.</NOTE> at the request of Mr. <HI>Flamsteed</HI> the great astronomer, measured the height, and found it to be from the sands 1545 feet.</P>
<P>AFTER climbing for some space among the loose stones, the front of three, if not four,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AN ANTIENT FORTRESS.</NOTE> walls presented themselves very dis∣tinctly one above the other. In most places the facings ap∣peared very perfect; but all of dry work. I measured the height of one wall, which was at the time nine feet; the thickness seven feet and a half. Between these walls, in all parts, were innumerable small buildings, mostly circular, and regularly faced within and without; but not disposed in any certain order. These had been much higher, as is evident from the fall of stones, which lie scattered at their bottoms; and
<PB N="307" REF="332"/>
probably had once the form of towers, as Sir <HI>John</HI> asserts. Their diameter in general is from twelve to eighteen feet; but some were far less, not exceeding five feet. The walls were in certain places intersected with others equally strong. On the north-west and south-east sides are the plain marks of two roads, of a zig-zag form, with the remains of walls on both sides, which lead to the summit. On the small area of the top had been a group of towers, or cells, like the former; one in the center, and five others surrounding it. Three are still distinct; of the two others are only faint vestiges. Near this had been, I believe, a similar group; but at present reduced to a shape∣less heap of stones. Near one of these groups is a well cut in the live rock, and always filled with water, supplied by the rains, and kept full by the frequent impending vapours.</P>
<P>THIS strong hold of the <HI>Britons</HI> is exactly of the same kind with those on <HI>Carn Madryn, Carn Boduan,</HI> and <HI>Tre'r Caeri,</HI> de∣scribed pp. 194. 206. 207. This was most judiciously founded, to cover the passage into <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and the remoter part of their country; and must, from its vast strength, have been invincible, except by famine; being inaccessible by natural steepness to∣wards the sea, and on the other parts fortified in the manner described<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a plan of the top and one side of this strong hold in the <HI>Archaelogia,</HI> iii. plate xxix. p. 352.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE white beam, or <HI>Aria Theophrasti,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ARIA THEO∣PHRASTI.</NOTE> is frequent on the sides of this rock, and in many similar places in <HI>Wales.</HI> No use is made of it in our country. The <HI>Swiss</HI> procure from the berries a good spirit. The wood is very hard, and excellent for
<PB N="308" REF="333"/>
flutes: and the wood, from its great solidity, was esteemed to make the best charcoal.</P>
<P>I DESCENDED from the summit into a hollow between the <HI>Penmaen</HI> and an adjacent mountain. Got upon my horse, and directed my course on a good sheep-walk towards <HI>Conway.</HI> In my way observed, above <HI>Gwdhw Glâs,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Dwygy∣vylcheu,</HI> a long series of antiquities, some of which are men∣tioned in the account of <HI>Penmaen Mawr</HI> preserved in <HI>Cambden.</HI> For a very considerable length of way I saw circles of stones of various diameters, and great <HI>Carneddau.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CIRCLES AND CARNEDDAU.</NOTE> The principal circle consists at present of ten upright stones, at unequal dis∣tances from each other; the largest of which is eight feet three inches high: on the ground is another, eleven feet two. The circle is completed by a low bank of loose stones placed be∣tween the greater. The diameter of this circle is eighty feet. Near this are four other circles, far inferior in size. In the cen∣ter of one is a flat stone, the remains of a Cromlech; pro∣bably the rest might have had those memorials before they were removed for the purpose of walling, or the like. About a quarter of a mile from these is a large <HI>Carnedd,</HI> composed of small stones, and near it another of large stones; and not far from these, a circle composed of small ones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An assemblage of antiquities of this nature may be seen in plate ii. book iii. of Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT'S <HI>Louthirna.</HI> That book is a small specimen of his great abilities. The vast treasure he possesses of drawings of <HI>Irish</HI> antiquities, in the highest degree merit publication, and clame the assistance of some dis∣tinguished patron, to enable a person of his merit to enrich the literary world with more of his labors.</NOTE>. Near the last is a great rude stone standing upright, called <HI>Maen y Campiau,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MAEN Y CAMPIAU.</NOTE>
<PB N="309" REF="334"/>
or <HI>Stone of the Games;</HI> and almost contiguous is a Carnedd, and a small circle of twelve stones. This tract had certainly been much inhabited; for all around are the foundations of small buildings, made of rounded stones, suitable to the rudeness and simplicity of distant ages. Small upright stones, and numbers of small <HI>Carnedds,</HI> are scattered in various places; and the ves∣tige of a formed road is to be seen pointing from hence towards the <HI>Conway.</HI></P>
<P>WHATSOEVER purpose the lesser circles might be designed for, there is great reason to suppose that the greater, especially that near to the <HI>Maen y Campiau,</HI> were the <HI>British</HI> circus for the exhibition of antient games; probably the <HI>Eisteddfods,</HI> or sessions for deciding the merits of rivals in our <HI>British Olympics,</HI> might have been originally held here, or in similar places. Of <HI>British</HI> games,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE ANTIENT GAMES.</NOTE> we had twenty-four, <HI>Pedair</HI> CAMP <HI>ar hugain,</HI> whose names, as preserved by Dr. <HI>Davies</HI> in his Dictionary, I shall give, with their explanation, as far as in my power. Of these, ten were called GWROLGAMPAU, or manly games; of these, six depended on bodily strength alone, and were styled <HI>Tadogion,</HI> i. e. <HI>Father games,</HI> because no instrument whatsoever was necessary to perform them: for they depended on the man, naked as he was born. The <HI>Greeks</HI> had their <HI>Pentathlum.</HI> We had one more. I. Strength to raise weights; II. Running; III. Leaping; IV. Swimming; V. Wrestling; VI. Riding. I imagine that the word <HI>Marchogaeth</HI> extends farther than the common acceptation, and that the game intended was a con∣test between charioteers; for no people were more skilled in the use of chariots in war than the <HI>Britons:</HI> it is therefore impro∣bable that they would not, in time of peace, exert their art in
<PB N="310" REF="335"/>
mimic combat, or in competitions of speed in the festive field. And these six were undoubtedly original games of this island, and from the earliest of times: of others, some doubt may be made.</P>
<P>THE remaining four manly games were, <HI>O Rym-arfau,</HI> or what depended on skill in arms. I. Archery; II. Playing with the sword and buckler; III. Playing with the <HI>Cleddyf Deuddwrn,</HI> or the two-handed sword, the antient weapon of the <HI>Britons,</HI> as exemplified in a statue of a soldier, found in digging among the ruins of <HI>London,</HI> after the great fire in 1666<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Monfaucon's Antiq.</HI> iv. 16. tab. ix.</NOTE>; IV. <HI>Chwarau Ffon Ddwybig,</HI> or playing with the two-end staff; which seems to correspond with the more modern quarter-staff.</P>
<P>AFTER these were the ten <HI>Mabolgampau,</HI> or JUVENILE games. Among them, three species of the chare: I. Coursing with the gre-hound; II. Fishing; III. Fowling. The remaining seven were of the domestic kind: I. <HI>Bairddoniath,</HI> or poetical competi∣tions, of which I have before spoken<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In my account of the <HI>Eisteddfoddau Caerwy, Tour in Wales,</HI> i. 427 to 446, some light is thrown on this and certain of the following articles.</NOTE>; II. Playing upon the harp; III. Reading <HI>Welsh;</HI> IV. Singing a <HI>Cywydd</HI> with music; V. Singing a <HI>Cywydd</HI> between four with accents; VI. Drawing of coats of arms; VII. Heraldry. These two seem so conge∣nial, as to be unnecessarily separated.</P>
<P>AFTER these were four <HI>Go-gampiau,</HI> or <HI>Sub-games.</HI> I. <HI>Chwa∣rau Gwydd-bwyll,</HI> a game like that of Draughts, played with <HI>men,</HI> and probably the game of <HI>Fox and Goose, Gwydd</HI> signify∣ing a goose, and <HI>Gwerin y Wyddbwyll</HI> the men of that game.</P>

<P>AFTER leaving the antiquities of <HI>Goddw Glâs,</HI> I joined the turnpike road above <HI>Sychnant.</HI> On the left, was pointed to me a lofty hill, impending over <HI>Conway March.</HI> On its sum∣mit is <HI>Castell Caer Lleion,</HI> a <HI>British</HI> post, surrounded with ditches, and strong ramparts of stones; an additional defence to the country, besides that of <HI>Penmaen Mawr.</HI> The view of part of <HI>Conway,</HI> and a large bend of the river, with its rich and wooded banks, are seen from the descent to them to great advantage.</P>
<P>I ENTERED CONWAY at the upper gate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONWAY.</NOTE> A more ragged town is scarcely to be seen, within; or a more beautiful one, without. The situation is on a steep slope to the verge of the river, here a mile broad at high-water. The form is nearly triangular, surrounded with lofty walls, guarded by twenty-four round towers. The lower face of the triangle borders on the river. A castle of matchless magnificence rises on a lofty rock, at one corner; and from near each end of the town-walls, fronting the <HI>Conwy,</HI> a curtain terminated with a round tower ran some way into the river, the more effectually to prevent the approach of an enemy from the water. Only one of these curtains exists; the other, with both the towers, have long since perished.</P>
<P>IN front is an extensive quay, from which is a delightful view up and down the river. The opposite side is hilly, varied with

The ground called <HI>Arcadia,</HI> laid out by my worthy friend and old school-fellow <HI>Owen Holland,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>Plâs-tyrion,</HI> the house of the reverend Mr. <HI>Owen Jones,</HI> well merit a visit from the traveller.</P>
<P>THE castle was built by <HI>Edward</HI> I. in the year 1284; who, I believe, employed the architect who built <HI>Caernarvon.</HI> All his skill seems to have been exerted here. A more beautiful fortress never arose. Its form is oblong, placed on all parts on the verge of the precipitous rock. One side is bounded by the river; another by a creek full of water at every tide, and most beautifully shaded by hanging woods. The other two sides face the town. Within are two courts; and on the outside project eight vast towers, each with a slender one of amazing elegance issuing from its top, within which had been a wind∣ing stair-case. In one of the great towers is a fine window, in form of an arched recess, or bow, ornamented with pillars. This, in antient times, was an elegant part of architecture, called the <HI>oriel,</HI> usual in the houses of people of rank; and appears, from a poem of the very age in which this was built, to have been the toilet of the ladies, and probably might have been that of Queen <HI>Elinor.</HI>

<P><PB N="313" REF="340"/>THE great hall suited the magnificence of the founder.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HALL.</NOTE> It is of a curved form, conformable to the bend of the outward walls, including one end with a large window, which seems to have been the private chapel. It extended a hundred and thirty feet in length, was thirty-two broad, and of a fine height. The roof once supported by eight noble arches, six of which still remain. A great fire-place at one end, and another on the side, warmed it: and six windows to the country, and three to the court, gave light to this spacious apartment. Beneath were vast vaults, the magazines of all that contributed to the con∣vivial mirth above.</P>
<P>THERE were two entrances into this fortress,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENTRANCES TO THE CASTLE.</NOTE> both contrived for security. The one from the <HI>Conwy,</HI> up a steep rock, once a winding narrow stairs, ending in a small advanced work before one of the gates of the castle, and protected by small round towers. At the other extremity is a similar work, from which had been a draw-bridge, occasionally dropped into the town, over a great foss. This entrance is expressed in the vignette, p. 1. of this volume.</P>
<P>THE town contains but few inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN.</NOTE> a considerable space being vacant of buildings. It has four entrances: the upper gate; the lower, or that next to the water; a portal between that and the castle; and another to the creek, called <HI>Porth y Felin,</HI> or the gate to the mill.</P>
<P>EDWARD I. made <HI>Conwy</HI> a free borough, and ordered that the mayor, who was the constable of the castle for the time being, should preserve its privileges. <HI>William Sikun</HI> was appointed first to that honor. At present it is governed by one alderman, a recorder, coroner, water-bailiff, and two serjeants at mace,

The privileges extended from <HI>Caernarvon</HI> to the river <HI>Clwyd;</HI> for none could be convicted of any crime, within that district, but by a jury collected within that tract. Such was the case with all the other <HI>English</HI> garrisons in <HI>North Wales.</HI></P>
<P>THE ferry is at present the property of the owner of <HI>Marle.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FERRY.</NOTE> An order was issued by <HI>Edward</HI> II. for either the repairing the boat, or building a new one: for the use of which the inhabi∣tants were to pay eight marks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>. At low-water the river is not fifty yards broad, nor above eight feet deep. The spring-tides rise twelve feet; but the aproach to this port is unsafe, by reason of the sand-banks.</P>
<P>THERE are some remains of the <HI>Cistercian</HI> abbey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBEY.</NOTE> founded in 1185 by <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth,</HI> prince of <HI>North Wales,</HI> in honor of the Blessed Virgin and All Saints<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Monasticon, <HI>i. 918.</HI></NOTE>. A long vaulted room of good masonry, worked with clay, but plaistered with lime; and a <HI>Saxon</HI> door, are still to be seen.

No one was to interfere in the elections, or affairs of the house. They were to enjoy all benefits of wrecks on the shores of their

They and their servants were to be exempt, in all parts, from tolls, pontage, and the like; and their free passage over the <HI>Menai, Conwy, Barmouth (Abermaw)</HI> and <HI>Dyni</HI> (perhaps <HI>Dyfi</HI>) is parti∣cularly provided for. Numbers of other privileges are men∣tioned, the charter of which is dated from <HI>Aberconwy,</HI> and wit∣nessed by <HI>Yorwerth Gam, Gwin ap Ednewein Ydon,</HI> the prince's chaplain, and by <HI>Madog ap Cador<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Monasticon, <HI>920.</HI></NOTE>.</HI> This shews that <HI>Conwy</HI> was a place of some note before the <HI>English</HI> conquest.

<P>A VERY rude figure, cut on stone, preserves the memory of <HI>Mary,</HI> mother to Archbishop <HI>Williams,</HI> who died of child-birth of twins, <HI>October</HI> 10th 1585; and a singular epitaph on a Mr. <HI>Hookes,</HI> proves the remarkable secundity of the family. <HI>Here lyeth the body of</HI> NICHOLAS HOOKES <HI>of</HI> CONWAY, Gent. <HI>who was the</HI> 41st <HI>child of his father</HI> WILLIAM HOOKES, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>by</HI> ALICE <HI>his wife, and the father of twenty-seven children; who died the</HI> 20th <HI>day of</HI> MARCH 1637.</P>
<P>IN the street not far from the abbey, is a very old house, with a singular window, with several coats of arms sculptured be∣neath; some relative to the <HI>Stanlies.</HI> This house is called the College.<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLLEGE.</NOTE> As it is said that <HI>Edward</HI> I. took this abbey into his hands, he possibly might establish here a place for the in∣struction of youth.</P>

letters I. H. S. X. P. S. and the date 1585. Within is a great quantity of rude stucco, with various arms of the founder's allies or patrons. Scattered over the walls and ceilings are swans, owls, cranes, ostriches, and bears and ragged staves; the last, the badges of <HI>Robert Dudley</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester;</HI> a piece of flattery paid to him by the founder of the house.</P>
<P>FEW of the remarkable events which have befel this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EVENTS.</NOTE> are preserved in history. When <HI>Henry</HI> III. made his calami∣tous encampment under <HI>Diganwy,</HI> opposite to this town, he dispatched three hundred renegado <HI>Welshmen</HI> of the borders, with some other troops, to rescue a ship of provision which had been stranded on this side. They succeeded; but, instigated by avarice, sacrilegiously plundered the abbey, and burnt seve∣ral houses belonging to it. The loyal <HI>Welsh</HI> grew desperate, attacked the banditti loaden with spoils, slew numbers, and hung or beheaded every prisoner whom they took<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>311.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>RICHARD II. before his return from <HI>Ireland,</HI> directed that the rendezvous of his forces, destined to oppose the usurping <HI>Bo∣lingbroke,</HI> should be here. Forty thousand loyalists, out of <HI>Che∣shire</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> had assembled under the banners of the earl of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> Wearied by the delays of their ill-fated prince, numbers disbanded themselves: yet sufficient remained ani∣mated against the usurper, and determined to follow their king through all his fortunes. <HI>Richard,</HI> seized with a panic, stole from <HI>Conwy</HI> in the night<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Helinshed, <HI>499.</HI></NOTE>, was betrayed by the earl of <HI>North∣umberland,</HI> and soon after perished in the hands of his enemy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> i. 45, is the sequel of his story.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="318" REF="347"/>THE town was almost depopulated by the plague, in 1607, and numbers of people were buried in the streets. It was ob∣served to break out here within three weeks of the time it ap∣peared in <HI>London,</HI> probably brought here by some sugitives.</P>
<P>IN mention of the transactions in this place during the civil wars, the last active scene of the life of Archbishop <HI>Williams</HI> must be related, especially as it was a part for which he under∣went the greatest, but perhaps unjust, calumny. As soon as he retired into <HI>Wales</HI> in 1642, he was resorted to by all the loyalists, being the person on whose prudence and spirit they could fully rely. He had received in charge from his majesty all <HI>North Wales,</HI> and in particular the castle of <HI>Conway</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip's <HI>Life of Archbishop</HI> Williams, 287.</NOTE>. He began with fortifying his house at <HI>Penrhyn;</HI> and was at consi∣derable expence in strengthening this fortress. In the peril∣ous state of those times, multitudes of the country gentlemen requested the archbishop to receive into the castle their writ∣ings, plate, and most valuable moveables. He undertook the charge, and gave to every owner a receipt, by which he made himself liable to the loss; and put his nephew, <HI>William Hookes,</HI> in possession of the place, in <HI>January</HI> 1603-4<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Philips, <HI>289.</HI></NOTE>. His Grace, from that time, was the protector of the country, not only from the violence of the enemy, but from the oppression of his own party. In <HI>May</HI> 1645, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> unfortunately superseded the pre∣late in his command, and caused Sir <HI>John Owen</HI> to take posses∣sion of the castle. This he did with most blameable violence, and with a constant evasion of giving the archbishop any se∣curity of the valuables he had in charge<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, 295, 296.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="348"/>AFFAIRS were in this state till <HI>June</HI> 1646; when <HI>Williams,</HI> foreseeing ruin to himself, irritated by injuries from those who had embarked in the same cause with himself, and in the criti∣cal time (when the king's affairs were desperate) invited by General <HI>Mytton</HI> to put himself on the favor of parlement, ac∣cepted his offer, and assisted him in the reduction of the place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Mytton's <HI>Letter, in</HI> Drake's Parl. Hist. <HI>xv. 3.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>MYTTON, by the advice of the archbishop, took the town by storm on <HI>August</HI> 15th: the latter assisted personally, and was wounded in the neck<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rushworth,</HI> iv. part i. 297.</NOTE>. With the severity usual at that time towards the <HI>Irish, Mytton</HI> seized on all that were found, and caused them to be tied back to back, and flung into the river<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Whitelook, <HI>219.</HI></NOTE>. The castle surrendered on the 10th of <HI>November;</HI> and <HI>Mytton,</HI> who is repre∣sented as a generous character, more haughty than covetous<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Philips, <HI>300.</HI></NOTE>, restored to every individual the property intrusted to <HI>Williams.</HI> For these services the parlement granted him a general pardon, and a release from all his sequestrations.</P>
<P>THE beauty and grandeur of this fortress seemed to have induced the governing powers to forbear offering any violence to its walls: that impiety was reserved for loyal hands. A grant had been made of it by the king to <HI>Edward Conway,</HI> earl of <HI>Conway.</HI> In 1665, the earl employed his servant, <HI>Milward,</HI> to take down the iron, timber, and lead, and to transport it to <HI>Ireland,</HI> under pretence of its being for his majesty's service<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The Earl's Letter in the Appendix.</NOTE>. <HI>Thomas Bulkely,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Colonel <HI>Wynn,</HI> and several of the princi∣pal gentlemen of the country, opposed the design; but their

remonstrance was over-ruled, and this noble pile reduced to nearly its present condition. At present it is held from the crown by <HI>Owen Holland,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P>SEVERAL years ago, the folly of some of the inhabitants, by getting stones from the rock beneath one of the great towers, brought down a vast segment. The ruins are the most awful I ever beheld; lying in stupendous fragments on the shore, some so unbroken as to preserve both the grand external rotundity and inward concavity: a hardened cement of stone and mortar eleven feet thick. The prospect of the upper part of the tower remains entire, suspended at a vast height above our heads, ex∣hibiting in the breach such a strength of walling as might have given to the architect the most reasonable hope that his work would have endured to the end of time. When I image to myself the gay appearance of this fortress, filled by the fes∣tive court of <HI>Edward,</HI> his beloved <HI>Elinor,</HI> and all the train of gallant nobility, who passed a <HI>Christmas</HI> here, exulting at the conquest of my hardy countrymen; and when I survey its pre∣sent ruins, my mind naturally falls into melancholy reflections, suitable to the scene around me. Let me only change the rock on <HI>Towy</HI>'s flood for that of <HI>Conwy,</HI> and a favorite poet will express the ideas that must arise in the mind, of its past and present state.</P>

It had the usual fosses, and vast ram∣parts of stones, with some remains of the facing of walls, and the foundations of three or four round buildings: but what struck me much, were two considerable spaces of ground thickly set with sharp-pointed stones, set upright in the earth, as if they had been to serve the use of <HI>chevaux du frize,</HI> to impede the approach of an enemy.

It is a place of great antiquity, being mentioned in the record of <HI>Caernarvon;</HI> but was inhabited in far earlier times, as appears by the ruins of a small castlet, now hid in woods, on the top of a small hill near the present house. <HI>Bodscallan</HI> signifies the dwelling-place of <HI>Scallan;</HI> in all probability a word corrupted from <HI>Caswallon,</HI> the owner in some distant period. It was one of those townships called <HI>Tre' Welyog,</HI> not entirely free. The tenants were originally possessors of hereditary estates, which were divided and subdivided among their posterity to the fourth descent, after which they became possessed by branches independent of each other; every one of whom paid for their own land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Record of</HI> Caernarvon, Bibl. Litt. <HI>19.</HI></NOTE>. This possibly might have been one of the three <HI>Gwelis,</HI> or estates of children from a common stock, originally belonging to <HI>Gloddaeth</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, 22.</NOTE>. In the present house is a good portrait of old Sir <HI>John Wynne</HI> of <HI>Gwedir.</HI> A small head, on board, of <HI>Robert Wynn,</HI> founder of the <HI>Plas Mawr</HI> in <HI>Conwy.</HI> He is painted in black, with a book in his hand, and with short grey hair and beard. But the most remarkable is that of Dr. <HI>Ellis Pryse,</HI> of <HI>Plas Yollin</HI> in <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> dated 1605; a creature of the earl of <HI>Leicester</HI>'s, and devoted to all his bad designs. <HI>Pryse</HI>'s dress is a white jacket, with a broad turnover; his hair yellow, and his beard thin, and of the same color; his visage very long, lank, and hypocritical. He was the greatest of our knaves in the period in which he lived; the most dreaded oppressor in his neighborhood; and a true syco∣phant; for a common address of his letters to his patron was, O LORD, <HI>in thee do I put my trust!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="354"/>FROM hence is a small walk to GLODDAETH,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLODDAETH.</NOTE> a seat of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI>'s, placed on the slope of a very extensive hill, or lime-stone rock, cloathed with successful plantations by Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> grandfather of the present possessor. Part of the plain below the house was planted, by the same gentleman, with fo∣rest-trees; and laid out, according to the taste of his time, in straight walks, intersecting each other, or radiating from a center, distinguished by a statue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS WALKS.</NOTE> The upper walks, having fortu∣nately a steep and stubborn rock for their basis, checked the modish propensity to rectitude; so there was a necessity to de∣viate from it; but in no greater degree than the flexure of a zigzag would admit. Notwithstanding some blemishes, cor∣rigible at an easy rate, these walks may be considered among those of the first rate of this island, for such beauties of view which nature can bestow; and, from those spots favored by the sight of <HI>Conwy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FINE VIEWS.</NOTE> I may add the majestic ones of antient art. Every flight of path presents new and grand objects: at first, of the great windings of the river towards <HI>Llanrwst,</HI> the lofty towers of <HI>Conwy,</HI> and the venerable walls of the town; and be∣yond, a long extent of <HI>alps,</HI> with <HI>Moel Siabod,</HI> the <HI>Drûm,</HI> and <HI>Carnead Llewelyn</HI> and <HI>Dafydd,</HI> appearing with distinguished height. From a little higher ascent is opened to us the dis∣charge of the <HI>Conwy</HI> into the sea, sublimely bounded by the lesser <HI>Penmaen,</HI> and the immense <HI>Orm's Head,</HI> or <HI>Llandudno;</HI> between which appear, a fine bay, the vast promotory of <HI>Penmaen Mawr,</HI> the isle of <HI>Priestholm,</HI> and the long extent of <HI>Anglesey.</HI> After gaining the summit, beneath is seen a considerable flat, with the estuary of the river <HI>Conwy</HI> falling into the <HI>Irish</HI> sea on one side, and the beautiful half-moon bay of <HI>Llandudno</HI> on

the other: one of whose horns is the great head of the same name; the other, the lofty rock <HI>Rhiwleden,</HI> or the little <HI>Orm's Head.</HI> A little farther progress brings us in sight of a great bay, sweeping semicircularly the shores; and beyond are the distant hills of <HI>Flintshire,</HI> and the entrances into the estuaries of the <HI>Mersey</HI> and <HI>Dce,</HI> frequently animated with shipping.</P>
<P>BESIDES the adventitious trees and shrubs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RARE PLANTS.</NOTE> these walks afford great amusement to the botanists, by their variety of rare plants, all within a very small compass.

<P>GREAT part of the present house was built by <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> On the dais of the great hall
<PB N="327" REF="356"/>
are painted the arms of that princess, those of the house, and of the profligate earl of <HI>Leicester;</HI> the last, a proof of the general flattery paid to his power.</P>
<P>HERE is, in a poor room, an excellent collection of books and manuscripts: among the last is a most beautiful copy of the first and second books of <HI>Froissart,</HI> a manuscript on vellum, with most elegant illuminations. The frontispiece represents the author on his knees, in a blue mantle, presenting his book to <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III. A king of <HI>France,</HI> distinguished by the <HI>fleurs de lis</HI> on his robes, holds a queen by the hand, who, from the arms of <HI>England,</HI> the lions on her robe, seems to be Queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> to whom <HI>Froissart</HI> was clerk of the closet. She holds by the hand a little boy, whose robe is also marked with the lions. This must have been <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> her grandson, after∣wards <HI>Richard</HI> II. A lady, and several other figures, appear in the piece. This book was given by Lord <HI>Buckburst</HI> to Sir <HI>William Cecil,</HI> and by him to his cotemporary of the house of Mostyn.</P>
<P>GLODDAETH came into possession of the family of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> by the marriage of his ancestor <HI>Howel ap Evan Vychan,</HI> in 1460, with <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter and heir of <HI>Gryffydd ap Rhys ap Gryffydd ap Madoc Gloddaeth ap Madoc ap Jerwerth Goch</HI> of <HI>Cryddyn,</HI> the hundred in which the house lies. The tenure of this place was perfectly free, and the tenant owed only suit and service to the county and hundred courts; and when they went to attend the prince in war, they went at his expence.</P>
<P>EGGLWYS RHOS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EGGLWYS RHOS.</NOTE> the parish church, is in a flat, at a small distance from <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> near a precipitous rock, cloathed with wood, called <HI>Bryn Maelgwyn.</HI> Painted in the east window is
<PB N="328" REF="357"/>
the figure of a man kneeling, dressed in a herald's mantle, with the arms of <HI>Englefield.</HI> From the maimed inscription I collect that he must have been <HI>Howel ap Tudor</HI> of <HI>Mostyn</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salisbury Pedigree, <HI>37.</HI></NOTE>, and that he had bestowed this window on the church.</P>
<P>BUT this church is celebrated for the death of the prince of <HI>Maelgwyn Gwynedd,</HI> who had taken shelter here to avoid the <HI>Vâd felen,</HI> or yellow pestilence, which at that time raged through <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Britons,</HI> like the <HI>Romans,</HI> personified disease. In this instance, it was to assume either the form of a <HI>Basilisc,</HI> or the powers of one, under the form of a fair woman, who slew <HI>Mael∣gwyn</HI> with a glance, as he incautiously looked out of the window; according to the prophecy, <HI>Pan ddelo y'r pry rhyfedd i forfa Rhi∣anedd, os gwel</HI> MAELGWN GWYNEDD FEFYD <HI>farw.</HI> <Q>Whenever a strange creature arrives on the marsh of <HI>Rhianedd,</HI> if <HI>Mael∣gwn Gwynedd</HI> looks at it, he will die.</Q></P>
<P>THE small remains of <HI>Diganwy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DIGANWY.</NOTE> or, as it is called by the <HI>English, Gannoc,</HI> are on two small hills, near the shore of the <HI>Con∣wy,</HI> at small distance from <HI>Egglwys Rhos.</HI> The walls crossed the space between the hills, and ran up their sides; on the summit of one is a vestige of a round tower, and here and there a few foundations of walls on the accessible parts. Dr. <HI>Powel,</HI> from the authority of the <HI>Welsh</HI> historians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His notes on <HI>Giraldus Cambr. Itin.</HI> lib. ii. c. 10.</NOTE>, says, there had been a city here, which, in 810, was destroyed by lightning; and <HI>Cambden</HI> adds, that he believed it to have been the antient <HI>Dictum,</HI> from its having been the station of a party of <HI>Nervii Dictenses,</HI> under the later emperors. I cannot discover the founder of the fortress, on whose ruins I contemplate. Possibly it might have been <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Rudland.</HI> We are told this country was parcel of the possessions of the earls of <HI>Chester;</HI> and that
<PB N="329" REF="358"/>
<HI>Robert</HI> was in it when he came to his fate. On <HI>July</HI> the 3d, 1088, our brave prince <HI>Gryffydd ap Cynan,</HI> with three ships, entered the <HI>Conwy;</HI> and landing under the castle at high-water, left the ships on shore at the recess of the tide. He ravaged the neighboring country, and drove towards his vessels a great booty of men and cattle. <HI>Robert,</HI> indignant at this, descended from his fortress, attended by a single soldier, <HI>Osbern de Orgar,</HI> and with∣out any defensive armour except his shield. The <HI>Welsh</HI> at∣tacked him with missile weapons, and, filling his shield so full of darts that it fell under their weight, the enemy rushed on him, cut off his head, and, fastening it to the mast, failed off in savage triumph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ordericus Vitalis, <HI>lib. viii. p. 670.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Llewelyn</HI> the Great destroyed this castle; but it was rebuilt, in 1210, by <HI>Randle Blondevil,</HI> earl of Chester<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>262.</HI></NOTE>. King <HI>John</HI> lay for some time encamped under its walls, in the year 1211, and was reduced to great streights by the policy of <HI>Llewelyn:</HI> he came between him and <HI>England,</HI> and cut off his resources<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE>. <HI>Henry</HI> III. fared even worse on the same spot, in 1245, at which time <HI>John de Grey</HI> of <HI>Wilton</HI> was constable.

<P>NOT far from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT TOWER.</NOTE> on the top of a low hill near <HI>Bryniau,</HI> is an antient tower. Its form is circular; its height about twenty feet, the diameter twelve. Its walls compose only two thirds of a circle, the rest is open to the top; and the finishing of the walls complete, without any appearance of there ever having been a door; and this opening is to the land. Within are the marks of two floors. Round the inside are three rows of
<PB N="330" REF="359"/>
square holes, none of which pass through the building. Its walls are of great thickness, and the mortar appears very antient. I can make no conjecture about the use; but describe it in or∣der to exercise the talents of others.</P>
<P>CONTINUED my ride along the shore by the flat <HI>isthmus</HI> which connects the high land of <HI>Gloddaeth</HI> with the great pro∣montory <HI>Llandudno.</HI> Ride along part of the last, on a narrow road above the sea, having on the right steep hills and preci∣pices. Reach <HI>Gogarth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GOGARTH.</NOTE> a long but narrow tract of great fer∣tility. It had been an appendage to the abbey of <HI>Conway,</HI> of which there remains part of a very strong building.</P>
<P>I ASCENDED on a very long and steep path to the top of <HI>Llandudno,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANDUDNO, OR ORM'S HEAD.</NOTE> a beautiful sheepwalk, consisting of a fine turf, ex∣cept where the rock appears, extending near four miles in length, and one in breadth. It lies in the manor of <HI>Gogarth,</HI> belonging to the see of <HI>Bangor.</HI> The western extremity is a vast precipice, the haunt of various sea-fowls in the season of breeding.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEA-FOWLS.</NOTE> The Gulls possess the lowest part; above them the Razor-bills and Guillemots have their quarters; over them croak the Corvorants; and Herons occupy the highest regions; and scattered in different parts are a few Puffins, and black Guillemots. The Peregrine Falcon builds in these rocks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FALCONS.</NOTE> The kind was in the days of falconry so excellent, that the great mini∣ster <HI>Burleigh</HI> sent a letter of thanks to an ancestor of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> for a present of a cast of Hawks from this place.</P>
<P>FALCONRY was in high esteem among the <HI>Welsh.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT FAL∣CONRY.</NOTE> Our prince had his chief falconer, who held the fourth rank among the offi∣cers of his court. He held his lands free; had a double portion of provender for his horse: the prince supplied him with woollen
<PB N="331" REF="360"/>
cloaths, the princess with linen. He brought his cup with him into the hall; but was not allowed to drink more than would quench his thirst, least he should get fuddled, and neglect his Hawks. He was allowed the hearts and lungs of all the animals in the royal kitchen, and sometimes a barren ewe to feed his birds. Whenever his Hawks killed any of the three most noble species of game, the Heron, the Bittern, or the Crane, he received from the prince three services; that of holding his stirrup when he descended from his horse, of holding his horse while he was taking the Hawks from the game, and of holding his stirrup again when he mounted his horse: and at night the prince honored him with serving him thrice at table with his own hands. In case the falconer took any of the royal birds in the prince's absence, he was to bring it into the hall, and shew it to him: on that the prince was to arise, or if he did not, he was to bestow on him the robe which he then wore. During the time that the Hawks were in their mew, the falconer was not bound to answer any suit. If he killed his horfe in the exercise of his office, the prince was to find him another. The fine for an injury to the chief falconer was vi cows, and cxxvi pence. His slaughter was not to be atoned for less than cxxvi cows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges Wallicae, <HI>23 to 26.</HI></NOTE>. Let me conclude with saying, that there was a peculiar tax for the support of this office, called <HI>Cylch Hebog Yddjon</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Record of</HI> Caernarvon, <HI>in</HI> Bibliotheea Litteraria, <HI>25.</HI></NOTE>, which fell on the vassals; for the prince contributed little or nothing to the expence of his amusements.</P>
<P>THE northern side of this promontory is broken into pre∣cipices of various heights; and the base of both these sides is
<PB N="332" REF="361"/>
washed by a very deep water. It is well worth the labor of ascending to the highest point, to view the extensive and va∣rious prospects.</P>
<P>ON the same side are the remains of several rude walls without mortar, called <HI>Llety Vadog,</HI> or the house of <HI>Madoc,</HI> a supposed ancestor of <HI>Gloddaeth:</HI> and not far from it is a strait narrow path, with stones on each side, probably the remains of two walls; a watch-place for Deer, as the name <HI>Wylfa yr Ceirw</HI> signifies.</P>
<P>ON a great eminence, called <HI>Dinas,</HI> is a large enclosure. The edge of the hill is surrounded with a rude wall; and within are multitudes of small circular hollows, about twelve feet in diameter, environed with walls; such as are found on <HI>Tre'r Caeri,</HI> and similar places, the rough habitations of our distant ancestors. Near this place is a <HI>Maen Sigl,</HI> rocking-stone, a great one, whose point of contact with the ground is so small as to make it moveable with the left touch. The country people call it <HI>Crŷd Tudno, St. Tudno's Cradle.</HI> This is sur∣rounded with a foss, and has a formed road to it. It is the conjecture of the learned, that the <HI>Druids</HI> made these stones an instrument of imposition on their votaries; and in case of any judicial determinations, pretended that none but their holy hands could move them: and probably they were surrounded with a foss, and had their prescribed road to keep off the vul∣gar, and give greater solemnity to the miraculous decision. The ingenious <HI>Bernier</HI> relates a superstition not very foreign from this. At <HI>Sendbrary,</HI> in the kingdom of <HI>Cachemire,</HI> the <HI>Bramins,</HI> the <HI>Druids</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> shewed him a stone which the strongest man could not lift, yet eleven of those holy men,
<PB N="333" REF="362"/>
with the tip of their finger, could effect it, on praying to their saint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bernier's vojage of Cachemire, <HI>112.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM hence I passed by the church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANDUDNO CHURCH.</NOTE> on the bleakest of situa∣tions, above the sea, and remote from all dwellings. It is de∣dicated to St. <HI>Tudno</HI> of <HI>Maes Gwyddno,</HI> the country now over∣flown by the sea, between <HI>Meirionyddshire</HI> and <HI>Llein.</HI> In de∣scending from this promontory I passed by several copper works, which at times are worked to advantage. The ride from hence along the side of <HI>Llandudno</HI> bay is extremely plea∣sant. I ascended to <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> near the foot of <HI>Rhewledin,</HI> a vast rock, which swarms in the season with Razor-bills and Puffins; and with Rock Pigeons, abundance of which regularly breed here, in preference to the dove-houses, which they con∣stantly quit at their laying-time.</P>
<P>I DESCENDED from <HI>Gloddaeth</HI> to the sea side, about two miles distant. Saw, close to the shore, the singular little building called <HI>St. Trillo's Chapel.</HI> It is oblong; has a window on each side, and at the end; a small door; and a vaulted roof, paved with round stones, instead of being slated. Within was a well. The whole building is surrounded with a stone wall.</P>
<P>ON a hill, about half a mile distant from this chapel, is the church of <HI>Llandrillo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANDRILLO.</NOTE> dedicated to the same saint. Near it is a large ruined house, called <HI>Bryn Euryn;</HI> formerly called <HI>Llŷs Maelgwyn Gwynedd,</HI> who had a palace on this spot. About the twelfth century it was inhabited by the great <HI>Ednyfed Vychan;</HI> and some time in the last was possessed by a family of the name of <HI>Conwy,</HI> of <HI>Welsh</HI> descent, derived from <HI>Gryffydd Goch,</HI> lord of <HI>Rhos</HI> and <HI>Rhyfoniod.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="363"/>KEEP along the shore, and pass by <HI>Rhos Vynach,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RHOS VYNACH.</NOTE> or the Marsh of the Monks, having been the property of <HI>Conwy</HI> abbey. The church still keeps share in a considerable wear, which runs from this point; the bishop, and the vicar of <HI>Llandrillo,</HI> having the fish of every tenth tide between them. At times they have a good chance of a profitable capture; for in two successive tides forty pounds worth of mackrel have been taken.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Rhos Vynach</HI> the land recedes inwards, and forms a pretty bay. The country slopes to the water edge, and is va∣ried with woods and cultivation. <HI>Penmaen Rhos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PENMAEN RHOS.</NOTE> a great lime∣stone rock juts into the sea at the end of the bay. In my me∣mory the traveller went along a narrow path cut on its front, like the road on <HI>Penmaen Mawr,</HI> but infinitely more terrible and dangerous: a fine coach-road has of late years been formed far behind this precipice. From thence I descended to <HI>Llan∣ddulas,</HI> a small village and church. In one of the deep bottoms of this neighborhood was betrayed the unfortunate prince <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> II. who had been deceived by the earl of <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> to go along with him from <HI>Conwy</HI> to meet <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> to settle amicably the quarrel between them. Hereabouts he suddenly found himself surrounded by a large band of armed men, placed there by the treacherous earl, who seizing on <HI>Ri∣chard,</HI> delivered him captive to the usurper in <HI>Flint</HI> castle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the whole story, agreeably expressed by suitable prints from old illumi∣nated MSS. in Mr. <HI>Strutt's Regal Antiquities.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A LITTLE farther on the right hand, high above the road, is <HI>Cefn Ogo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CEFN OGO.</NOTE> a lofty precipice; white, unless where darkened by the ivy which spreads along the front. In the middle is the
<PB N="335" REF="364"/>
most magnificent entrance into a cave which <HI>Britain</HI> can boast. It seems like the portal of a noble cathedral, arched, and di∣vided within by what has the appearance of a great column.</P>
<P>FROM near this place begins the rich arable flat, which ex∣tends over <HI>Rudland Marsh,</HI> and beyond <HI>Prestatyn</HI> in <HI>Flintshire.</HI> The small town of <HI>Abergeleu</HI> lies near the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ABERGELEU</NOTE> about a mile from <HI>Cefn Ogo.</HI> It lies near the clayey cliffs which impend over the sea. Tradition says, that in old times that element had over∣whelmed a vast tract of inhabited country once extending northward; a dateless, nameless, epitaph on the church-yard wall is called in as evidence. <HI>Yma mae'n gorwedd yn monwent mihangel, gwr oeddai annedd dair miltor yn y gogledd.</HI> <Q>In this church-yard lies a man who lived three miles to the north of it.</Q> But, as better proof, I have observed, at low-water, far from the clayey banks, a long tract of hard loam, filled with the bodies of oak trees, tolerably entire; but so soft as to be cut with a knife as easily as wax.</P>
<P>OF this parish was <HI>Marchud ap Cynan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MARCHUD AP CYNAN.</NOTE> cotemporary with <HI>Roderic</HI> the Great, and one of the tribes of <HI>North Wales</HI> whose posterity gave princes to the <HI>British</HI> empire. His seat was <HI>Brynffanigl,</HI> where likewise his descendant, the great <HI>Ednyfed Vychan,</HI> sometimes resided.</P>
<P>ABERGELEU is bounded to the right by high limestone hills, at times productive of lead ore. On one of them, projecting from the rest, called <HI>Coppa yr Wylfa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">COPPA YR WYLFA.</NOTE> or the mount of the watch∣tower, is a very strong <HI>British</HI> post. The front is a great pre∣cipice; out of whose interstices grows the <HI>Aria Theophrasti;</HI> and across the accessible part are defences of stone and earth. In a glen beneath is a ditch, called <HI>Ffôs y Bleiddiaid,</HI> or the ditch
<PB N="336" REF="365"/>
of the Wolves; possibly from the frequency of those animals in these parts. Mr. <HI>Llwyd,</HI> in his Itinerary, speaks of a mount near <HI>Abergeleu</HI> divided in two, on which formerly stood a castle, called <HI>Pen y Pīl,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PEN Y PĪL.</NOTE> possibly a residence of the antient lords.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Abergeleu</HI> I ascended to the neighboring parish of <HI>Cegidoc,</HI> or, as the <HI>English</HI> call it, St. <HI>George.</HI> It was formerly annexed to St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> and the parishioners were obliged to re∣pair the street wall of the church-yard.</P>
<P>HIGH above this place, on the top of a hill called <HI>Pen y Parc,</HI> is a very strong post, said to have been occupied by <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> after his fine retreat before <HI>Henry</HI> II;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAMP OF OWEN GWYNFDD.</NOTE> whom he kept here at bay, and politically secured his dominions from further invasion: for it was on this spot, not among the <HI>Snowdon</HI> hills, as Lord <HI>Lyttelton</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ii. 385. 3d ed. octavo.</NOTE> supposes, that our gallant prince made a most effectual stand, and stopped all further pro∣gress of the invader. On the accessible sides are double and treble ditches and ramparts, the others are sufficiently guarded by precipices. The area is near three quarters of a mile round, and, near the edge of the steep part, facing <HI>Rudland,</HI> is smoothed into the form of a terrace.</P>
<P>ST. GEORGE had in this parish his <HI>Holy Well,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUPERSTITIONS.</NOTE> at which the <HI>British Mars</HI> had his offering of horses; for the rich were wont to offer one, to secure his blessing on all the rest. He was the tutelar saint of those animals; all that were distempered were brought, sprinkled with the water, and this blessing bestowed: <HI>Rhad</HI> DUW <HI>a Sant</HI> SIOR <HI>arnat.</HI> <Q>The blessing of GOD and St. <HI>George</HI> be on thee.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="366"/>THE well of St. <HI>Aelian,</HI> a parish not far from <HI>Llandrillo</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> has been in great repute for the cures of all diseases, by means of the intercession of the saint; who was first invoked by earnest prayers in the neighboring church. He was also applied to on less worthy occasions, and made the in∣strument of discovering thieves, and of recovering stolen goods. Some repair to him to imprecate their neighbors, and to request the saint to afflict with sudden death, or with some great mis∣fortune, any persons who may have offended them. The be∣lief in this is still strong; for three years have not elapsed since I was threatened by a fellow (who imagined I had in∣jured him) with the vengeance of St. <HI>Aelian,</HI> and a journey to his well to curse me with effect.</P>
<P>I SHALL here bring into one point of view the several religi∣ous customs used among us in former times;<NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS.</NOTE> which have been gradually dropped, in proportion as the age grew enlightened. Several were local, several extended through the whole country: perhaps some, which were expressive of their hatred of vice, or which had a charitable end, might as well have been retained, notwithstanding the smack of folly that was often to be per∣ceived in them.</P>
<P>IN church, at the name of the Devil, an universal spitting seized the congregation, as if in contempt of that evil spirit; and whenever <HI>Judas</HI> was mentioned, they expressed their ab∣horrence of him by smiting their breasts.</P>
<P>IF there be a <HI>Fynnon Vair,</HI> the well of our Lady, or any other saint, the water for baptism was always brought from thence; and after the ceremony was over, old women were very fond of washing their eyes in the water of the font.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="367"/>PREVIOUS to a funeral, it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female) to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they present, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and require the person to drink a little of it immediately. When that is done, all pre∣sent kneel down; and the minister, if present, says the Lord's Prayer: after which, they proceed with the corpse; and at every cross-way, between the house and the church, they lay down the bier, kneel, and again repeat the Lord's Prayer; and do the same when they first enter the church-yard. It is also cus∣tomary, in many places, to sing psalms on the way; by which the stillness of rural life is often broken into, in a manner finely productive of religious reflections.</P>
<P>To this hour, the bier is carried by the next of kin; a custom considered as the highest respect that filial piety can pay to the deceased. This was a usage frequent among the <HI>Romans</HI> of high rank; and it was thought a great continuance of the good fortune which had attended <HI>Metellus Macedonicus</HI> through his whole being, that when he had, in the fulness of years, passed out of life by a gentle decay, amidst the kisses and embraces of his nearest connections, he was carried to the funeral pile on the shoulders of his four sons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Valer. Max. <HI>lib. vii. c. 1.</HI></NOTE>; and, let me add, that each one of them had enjoyed the greatest offices of the com∣monwealth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plinii, Hist. Nat. <HI>lib. vii. c. 44.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="368"/>AMONG the <HI>Welsh</HI> it was reckoned fortunate for the deceased if it should rain while they were carrying him to church, that his bier might be wet with the dew of heaven.</P>
<P>IN some places it was customary for the friends of the dead to kneel, and say the Lord's Prayer over the grave, for several <HI>Sundays</HI> after the interment; and then to dress the grave with flowers.</P>

<P>IT is still usual to stick, on the eve of St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> over the doors, sprigs of St. <HI>John's wort,</HI> or in lieu of it the common Mugwort. The intent was to purify the house from evil spirits; in the same manner as the <HI>Druids</HI> were wont to do with <HI>Vervaine,</HI> which still bears with the <HI>Welsh</HI> the significant title of <HI>Cas gan Gythral,</HI> or <HI>the Daemons aversion.</HI></P>
<P>UPON <HI>Christmas</HI>-day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLYGAN.</NOTE> about three o'clock in the morning, most of the parishioners assembled in church, and after prayers and a sermon, continued there singing psalms and hymns with great devotion till broad day; and if, through age or infirmity, any were disabled from attending, they never failed having prayers at home, and carols on our SAVIOUR'S nativity. The former part of the custom is still preserved; but too often per∣verted
<PB N="340" REF="369"/>
into intemperance. This act of devotion is called <HI>Ply∣gan,</HI> or the <HI>Crowing of the Cock.</HI> It has been a general belief among the superstitious, that instantly,</P>
<Q><L>at his warning,</L>
<L>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</L>
<L>Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies</L>
<L>To his confine.</L></Q>
<P>But during the holy season, the Cock was supposed to exert his power throughout the night; from which, undoubtedly ori∣ginated the <HI>Welsh</HI> word <HI>Plygan,</HI> as applied to this custom. Accordingly, <HI>Shakespear</HI> finely describes this old opinion:</P>
<Q><L>Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes</L>
<L>Wherein our SAVIOUR'S birth is celebrated,</L>
<L>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</L>
<L>And then, they say, no spirit walks abroad:</L>
<L>The nights are wholesome: then no planets strike:</L>
<L>No fairy takes: no witch hath power to charm,</L>
<L>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</L></Q>
<P>SOON after leaving <HI>St. George,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">KINMAEL.</NOTE> I passed by <HI>Kinmael</HI> house and park, in a lofty situation on the left. This place had been, during four generations, the property of the <HI>Hollands,</HI> of a noble <HI>English</HI> descent, long settled in this part of <HI>Britain,</HI> and branched into several respectable families. The pedigrees de∣rive them from a Sir <HI>Thomas Holland,</HI> who, tradition says, came, with another brother, into <HI>Wales</HI> in troublesome times. I have reason to suppose them to have been <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI> the two younger sons of <HI>John Holland,</HI> duke of <HI>Exeter;</HI> who died in 1446, and left to each of them an annuity of forty

pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baron, <HI>ii. 81.</HI></NOTE>. They were of a most unpopular family, therefore pro∣bably retired to shun the miseries they might experience in that age of civil discord. <HI>Pierce Holland,</HI> eleventh in descent from Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> made his settlement at <HI>Kinmael</HI> by his marriage with <HI>Catherine,</HI> daughter to <HI>Richard ap Evan ap Dafydd Vychan</HI> and <HI>Alice</HI> his wife, heiress of the place, daughter of <HI>Gryffydd Lloyd</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ap Evan ap Rhys ap Gryffydd Lloyd ap Rohyn ap Rhys ap Robert.</NOTE>. In the last century, one of his descendants had two daughters. Colonel <HI>Carter,</HI> an officer in the service of the par∣lement, made choice of <HI>Catherine,</HI> the youngest, and took the estate with her. A wag said, that he had chosen the best piece of <HI>Holland</HI> in the country. He left the eldest sister <HI>Mary</HI> to Colonel <HI>Price</HI> of <HI>Rhiwlas,</HI> a royalist. About fifty years ago, a descendant of his, <HI>John Carter,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> alienated the place to the late Sir <HI>George Wynne,</HI> Bart.</P>
<P>IN a very wet situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VAENOL.</NOTE> beneath <HI>Kinmael,</HI> is <HI>Vaenol;</HI> one of the best old houses in the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> It was built in 1595, by <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> a younger son of <HI>Wickwer,</HI> and register of St. <HI>Asaph</HI> in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> a place extremely profitable, before the powers of the church were abridged. At this place, <HI>Brynpolin,</HI> and <HI>Wickwer,</HI> had been chapels of ease to St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> and three out of the four vicars did duty at them in turn. A fine stone coffin, from that of <HI>Vaenol,</HI> lies in the garden of this house.</P>
<P>IN my way from <HI>Kinmael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BODLE-WITHAN.</NOTE> see <HI>Bodle-withan,</HI> the seat of <HI>John Williams,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a purchase of his father, second son to Sir <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> speaker of the house of commons. Previous to that, it

<HEAD>FROM DOWNING TO MONTGOMERY AND SHREWSBURY.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Wednesday, July</HI> 4th 1776, I left home; breakfasted with the reverend Mr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> at <HI>Caerroys,</HI> and with him de∣scended into the pretty little vale, which leads from <HI>Mold</HI> to <HI>Denbigh;</HI> and immediately on crossing it ascend the steep and lofty side of <HI>Bwlch Coed y Mynydd,</HI> a great hill, the last of the <HI>Clwydian</HI> chain, before it is broken by the streight of <HI>Bod∣vari.</HI> On the side of this hill, at <HI>Llys Coed y Mynydd,</HI> towards the left, lived <HI>Ednowain Bendew,</HI> or <HI>Ednowain</HI> the Strong∣headed, lord of <HI>Tegengl</HI> in 1079, and one of the fifteen tribes of <HI>North Wales.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Llwythau,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRIBES OF NORTH WALES.</NOTE> or tribes, were the nobility of <HI>North Wales.</HI> They commenced extremely early; and, at different times, were lords of distinct districts, and called to that honor by se∣veral princes. The latest were about the time of <HI>Dafydd ap Owen Gwynedd,</HI> who began his reign in 1169. We are left ig∣norant of the form by which they were called to this rank.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="373"/>All we know is, that each of them enjoyed some office in the court of our princes, which seems to have been hereditary, and probably to be attendant on the honor.</P>
<P>AFTER reaching the summit of the hill, a rich and extensive view presented itself, of the fertile vale of <HI>Clwyd</HI> beneath, and the great range of our alpine country, at length jutting into the sea at the bold promontories of <HI>Llandudno</HI> and <HI>Penmaen Mawr.</HI> The descent into the vale is gradual, along a beautiful terrace, for a considerable space far above it. <HI>Vron-yw,</HI> the seat of <HI>John Madocks,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> commands a delightful prospect. Its master adds to the many illustrious proofs we have at this period, that the modern <HI>Welsh</HI> are as eminent in persuasive rhetoric as our <HI>Gaulish</HI> neighbors were in days of yore.</P>
<P>PASS by the small churches of <HI>Llan-Gwifan, Llan-Dyrnog, Llan-Gynbafal,</HI> and <HI>Llan-Rhychan,</HI> dedicated to the Saints <HI>Gwy∣fan, Tyrnog, Cynhafal,</HI> and <HI>Rhychan,</HI> all in the county of DEN∣BIGH, and diocese of <HI>Bangor.</HI> Beneath the church of <HI>Llanbe∣der,</HI> reach nearly the bottom of the vale; and continue my journey through <HI>Ruthin,</HI> and along <HI>Nantclwyd,</HI> by a good old house of the same name.</P>
<P>AFTER resting one night at <HI>Corwen,</HI> proceed as far as <HI>Llan∣drillo,</HI> on the road to <HI>Bala;</HI> and near that village turn to the left into a narrow glen, much wooded, watered by a rude tor∣rent, and bounded by high hills. At its extremity, near a farm called <HI>Blaen y Cwm,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MILLTIR GERRIC.</NOTE> begin to ascend <HI>Milltir Gerrig,</HI> or the <HI>Stoney Mile;</HI> a <HI>Bwlch,</HI> or pass amidst the <HI>Berwyn</HI> hills, about a mile in length, with the mountains, black with heath, soaring on each fide to a stupendous height. It is the great pass in these parts from <HI>Meirionyddshire</HI> into
<PB N="346" REF="374"/>
and divides the counties: the latter is called by the <HI>Welsh, Sir Tre Faldwyn,</HI> or the shire of the town of <HI>Baldwin,</HI> lieutenant of the marches in the time of the Conqueror, who built the town; the name of which was afterwards changed to that of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> derived from <HI>Roger de Montgomery,</HI> the founder of the castle: which name it gave to the county when it was formed into one by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. The first member that appears on record was <HI>Edward Leech,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who sat in 1542. <HI>Humphry Llwyd</HI> justly celebrates the fertility of its vallies, the stature and beauty of its inhabitants; but stigmatises them with the character of idleness, and of being addicted to useless amusements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commentariolum, <HI>92.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The descent from this pass is very steep; but a fine road was then forming, with the great view of giving the <HI>Irish</HI> a shorter way into their country, through <HI>Oswestry,</HI> and over the <HI>Bwlch,</HI> through the county of <HI>Meirionydd.</HI> This is one of the vast designs of the present age, which will effect communications with places before almost inaccessible.</P>
<P>ON arriving at the bottom, I again found myself in narrow vales, loftily bounded. After about three miles riding reached <HI>Llangynog,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANGYNOG.</NOTE> a small village, in the parish of the same name, in the diocese of <HI>St. Asaph.</HI> This place was the source of short-lived wealth to the maternal relation of the present earl of <HI>Powys.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LEAD MINE.</NOTE> A lead mine was discovered here in the year 1692, which was in most parts a vein of three yards and a half thick,
<PB N="347" REF="375"/>
and was worked to the depth of a hundred yards, when the water became too powerful. It continued in a flourishing state during a period of near forty years; yielded about four thou∣sand tons annually: was sold at 7<HI>l.</HI> a ton, and smelted on the spot; and brought in a clear revenue to the family of twenty thousand pounds a year.</P>
<P>A SLATE quarry has been discovered of late years in the pa∣rish. About 904,000 were sold from <HI>November</HI> 1, 1775, to <HI>November</HI> 1, 1776; which sell at the rate of from 6<HI>s.</HI> to 20<HI>s.</HI> a thousand; but the want of water carriage is a great loss to the work.</P>
<P>AT about two miles distance from <HI>Llangynog</HI> I turned up a small valley to the right, to pay my devotions to the shrine of St. <HI>Monacella,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. MONACELLA.</NOTE> or, as the <HI>Welsh</HI> style her, <HI>Melangell.</HI> Her legend relates, that she was the daughter of an <HI>Irish</HI> mo∣narch, who had determined to many her to a nobleman of his court. The princess had vowed celibacy. She fled from her father's dominions, and took refuge in this place, where she lived fifteen years without seeing the face of man. <HI>Brochwel Yscythrog,</HI> prince of <HI>Powys,</HI> being one day a hare-hunting, pur∣sued his game till he came to a great thicket; when he was amazed to find a virgin of surprising beauty, engaged in deep devotion, with the hare he had been pursuing under her robe, boldly facing the dogs who retired to a distance, howling, notwithstanding all the efforts of the sportsmen to make them seize their prey. Even when the huntsman blew his horn, it stuck to his lips. <HI>Brochwel</HI> heard her story; and gave to God and her a parcel of lands, to be a sanctuary to all that fled there. He desired her to found an abbey on the spot. She did so, and died
<PB N="348" REF="376"/>
abbess, in a good old age. She was buried in the neighboring church, called <HI>Pennant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH OF PENNANT MELANGELL.</NOTE> and from her distinguished by the addition of <HI>Melangell.</HI> Her hard bed is shewn in the cleft of a neighboring rock. Her tomb was in a little chapel, or oratory, adjoining to the church, and now used as a vestry-room. This room still is called <HI>Cell-y-bedd,</HI> or the <HI>Cell of the Grave;</HI> but her reliques, as well as her image, have been long since re∣moved: but I think the last is still to be seen in the church∣yard. The legend is perpetuated by some rude wooden carv∣ings of the saint, with numbers of hares scuttling to her for pro∣tection. She properly became their patroness. They were called <HI>Mwyn Melangell</HI>—<HI>St. Monacella</HI>'s Lambs. Till the last century, so strong a superstition prevaled, that no person would kill a hare in the parish; and even later, when a hare was pursued by dogs, it was firmly believed, that if any one cried <Q>God <HI>and St. Mo∣nacella be with thee,</HI></Q> it was sure to escape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See her life.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the church-yard is a stone with the figure of an armed man, which now serves as a common grave-stone, but once covered the remains of the eldest son of <HI>Owen Gwynedd, Jor∣werth Drwyndwn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMB OF JORWERTH DRWYNDWN.</NOTE> or <HI>Edward</HI> with the <HI>broken nose,</HI> who was put aside of the succession on account of the blemish<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Powel's Hist▪ Wales, <HI>227.</HI></NOTE>. Hither he had fled for refuge from the cruelty of his brother <HI>Dafydd ap Owen Gwynedd,</HI> this place having been one of our most ce∣lebrated sanctuaries. On his shield is inscribed <HI>Hic jacet Etwart.</HI> Tradition says, he was killed not far from hence, at a place called <HI>Bwlch Croes Jorwerth.</HI></P>
<P>THIS valley is exceedingly picturesque: inclosed by hills on all sides, except its entrance; watered by the <HI>Tanat,</HI> which
<PB N="349" REF="377"/>
springs not far off. The upper end is bounded by two vast precipices, down which, at times, fall two great cataracts; be∣tween them juts out the great and rude promontory of <HI>Moel ddu Mawr,</HI> which almost divides the precipices into equal parts: and all together formed a fine and solemn retreat for de∣votees. On the side of this valley is the house of <HI>Llechwedd∣garth,</HI> the property of <HI>Thomas Thomas,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Continue my journey for some time along the valley, then ascend and descend a series of grassy hills of a moderate height, and observe in many parts the narrower passes crossed by entrenchments, in old times designed to interrupt the inroads of an invader. It is said, that a <HI>Roman</HI> road goes near this place towards <HI>Aber∣ystwyth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BODFACH.</NOTE> Descend to <HI>Bodfach,</HI> the seat of my friend <HI>Bel Lloyd,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by virtue of his marriage with Miss <HI>Price,</HI> heiress of the place. This and several other estates, even as far as the borders of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> belonged to the <HI>Kyffins,</HI> so named from being <HI>Kyffi∣niad,</HI> or borderers. They were descended from <HI>Eneon Evell,</HI> or <HI>Eneon the Twin,</HI> brother to <HI>Kynric Evell,</HI> illegitimate sons of <HI>Madoc ap Meredydd ap Blyddyn ap Cynven,</HI> prince of <HI>Powys;</HI> who gave <HI>Eneon</HI> his portion in this country, and <HI>Kynric</HI> his in <HI>Molesdale</HI> and its neighborhood. <HI>Owen Brogynton,</HI> eldest of his natural children, was settled in <HI>Edeirnion.</HI></P>
<P>THE valley about <HI>Bodfach</HI> expands, is admirably cultivated, is watered by the <HI>Cain,</HI> and prettily bordered by low hills finely wooded. The town and church of <HI>Llanvyllin</HI> happily fill one angle, and vary the view.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Bodfach</HI> I made an excursion to <HI>Llwydiarth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLWYDIARTH.</NOTE> a large old house in the parish of <HI>Llanwddyn,</HI> seated in a hilly naked country. It was formerly the property of the great family of
<PB N="350" REF="378"/>
the <HI>Vaughans,</HI> descended from <HI>Aleth Hên,</HI> king of <HI>Dived,</HI> or <HI>Pembrokeshire.</HI> The estate was conveyed to the late Sir <HI>Watkin Williams Wynn,</HI> by his first wife, daughter and heiress to the last owner. From one part of the ride had a view into <HI>Cardi∣ganshire,</HI> and of the great naked mountain of <HI>Plynlimmon,</HI> co∣vered with heath, or moory grass.</P>
<P>I CANNOT omit in this place mention of an excursion formerly made to <HI>Llanrhaiadr yn Mochnant,</HI> a neighboring parish, partly in this county, partly in <HI>Denbighshire.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANRHAIADR YN MOCHNANT.</NOTE> The church is seated in the last, dedicated to St. <HI>Dogvan,</HI> son of <HI>Brychan.</HI> Dr. <HI>Wil∣liam Morgan,</HI> who first translated the Bible into <HI>Welsh,</HI> was vicar of this. He was rewarded by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> with the bishoprick of <HI>Llandaff,</HI> in 1595, and was removed to that of St. <HI>Asaph</HI> in 1601, where he died <HI>September</HI> 10th, 1604, and was interred in the cathedral.</P>
<P>THE facetious but learned preacher Dr. <HI>South,</HI> was the last rector of the parish. On his decease, the rectorial tithes were appropriated by act of parlement to the maintenance of the choir and repair of the cathedral church of St. <HI>Asaph.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST speak with due respect of the memory of the late worthy vicar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PISTILL RHAIADR.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Worthington;</HI> to whose hospitable house I was indebted for a seasonable reception, the wet evening which for∣tunately preceded my visit to the celebrated cataract <HI>Pistill Rha∣iadr.</HI> It terminates the precipitous end of a very narrow valley, and, as it were, divides a bold front of the <HI>Berwyn</HI> mountains. After sliding for some time along a small declivity, it darts down at once two-thirds of the precipice; and, falling on a ledge, has, in process of time, worn itself a passage through the rock, and makes a second cataract beneath a noble arch which
<PB N="351" REF="379"/>
it has formed; on the slippery summit of which, a daring shepherd will sometimes terrify you with standing. The se∣cond fall reaches the bottom, and assumes the name of the <HI>Rhaiadr,</HI> or the cascade. The desect of this noble fall, is the want of wood. When I visited it, the approach was very bad; but that is not only effectually remedied by the late benevo∣lent vicar, but, as I am informed, he has besides erected a cot∣tage, as a retreat to the traveller from the fury of a storm.</P>
<P>THE abundance of sheep, which enliven these hills, brought, at the time I visited the country, great wealth into it. The flannel manufacture, and that of a coarse cloth for the army, and for the covering the poor negroes in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> is manufactured in most parts of the county. It is sent and sold in the rough to <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> a practice very contrary to the interest of the country.</P>
<P>LEAVE <HI>Bodfach;</HI> and, for the sake of a beautiful view, am led by Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> a little out of my way, to the top of a hill, from whence is a prospect of a rich expanded vale, with the church of <HI>Llanvechan</HI> in the midst. Part is bounded by low and fertile hills. The great rock of <HI>Llan y Mynach,</HI> the magazine of limestone for a vast tract of country, closes one side; beyond them extends the great flat of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> with the <HI>Wrekin</HI> hill rising insulated in the distant ground. I returned through <HI>Llanfyllin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANFYLLIN.</NOTE> a small town, which had a charter bestowed on it by <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd ap Gwynwynwyn,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> II. and confirmed by <HI>Edward de Charlton,</HI> lord of <HI>Powys.</HI> This gave the burgesses exemption from tolls, <HI>Theam</HI> through∣out his territories, <HI>Gileam,</HI> and <HI>Hampsum.</HI> They could take, imprison, and try, any thieves or malefactors; and, should such
<PB N="352" REF="380"/>
escape, they had liberty of pursuing them for a league round the town. Any stranger residing in it, and paying scot and lot for a year, became free. It is governed by two bailiffs, chosen annually; who, among other privileges granted it by <HI>Charles</HI> II, were made justices of the peace within the corpora∣tion, during the time of their office<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cambden, <HI>ii. 783.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>RIDE for some time on the <HI>Oswestry</HI> road. Ascend to the right; go near <HI>Bryn Gwyn,</HI> a seat of <HI>William Mostyn,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> above which is a circular <HI>British</HI> post. Numbers of them front the low country, on the hills which jut into it, as if guards to pro∣tect the internal parts from invasion. Across the road, in one place, I met the vestiges of a very strong rampart, to defend a pass into the vale of <HI>Meivod,</HI> which soon after appeared in view. The church and village are situated in the middle of the valley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VALE OF MEIVOD.</NOTE> which is quite flat; extends in length more than five miles, and about half a mile broad. Three parts are bounded by low hills, prettily wooded; one end opens into the plain, and is finely terminated by the <HI>Freiddin</HI> hills, a vast mass, and con∣spicuous feature in this county, and part of <HI>Shropshire.</HI> The <HI>Vyrnyw,</HI> called by Dr. <HI>Powel, Marnovia,</HI> a beautiful river, winds along the middle of the vale. Its borders rich in wheat, rye, and grass.</P>
<P>THE church is dedicated to St. <HI>Tyssilio,</HI> a prince of <HI>Powys,</HI> the supporter of the <HI>British</HI> churches against <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk.

There is reason to suppose, that it took its name from its having been, in the very early ages of Christianity, the residence of a hermit or recluse; for <HI>Meudwyfod</HI> implies a hermit's habitation, and <HI>Lan</HI> is frequently added to many <HI>Welsh</HI> words, to imply them to have been inclosed places; such as <HI>Gwinllan,</HI> a vineyard; <HI>Cor∣lan,</HI> a sheepfold; <HI>Ydlan,</HI> a stackyard: so that <HI>Meudwylan</HI> would signify the precinct of the hermit, and, by the assistance of a <HI>Roman</HI> termination, become <HI>Meudwylanium;</HI> and that, readily, more latinized into <HI>Mediolanum,</HI> the name we find it bears in the Itinerary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Iter Britanniarum.</NOTE>, where it is placed between <HI>Bovium Bangor</HI> and <HI>Rutunium Rowton.</HI> We find it again in the Chorography of the <HI>Ravenna</HI>'s, and in <HI>Ptolemy</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Horsely, <HI>374. 492.</HI></NOTE>. If those periods are supposed to have been too early for the institution of monastic life in this island, I must defend my opinion by that of the learned <HI>Tanner,</HI> who reasonably supposes it to have been nearly coeval with Christianity in <HI>Great Britain</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Preface.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> antiquity rests upon the authority of one of our older writers<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Girald. Cambr. Itin.</HI> Dr. <HI>Bowel</HI>'s note, c. iv. lib. ii.</NOTE>; who mentions that in his time there were con∣siderable remains of <HI>venerable antiquity;</HI> that several founda∣tions, floors, and causeways, have been dug up; but whether any coins, arms, or inscriptions, have been met with, does not appear. <HI>Cambden</HI> also mentions a field, called <HI>Erw'r Porth,</HI> or
<PB N="354" REF="382"/>
the field of the gate, where he concludes might have stood one of the <HI>Portae,</HI> or gates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cambden, <HI>ii. 781, 782.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>To revert to the Christian antiquities: <HI>Meivod</HI> is said to have been the archdeaconry of all <HI>Powystand,</HI> and that it had two churches besides the present. Whether the chapel, whose ruins were standing in no very remote period, and was called <HI>Eglwys Gwyddfarch,</HI> from a <HI>British</HI> saint of this country, might not have been one, I cannot say; the other was named <HI>Eglwys Vair,</HI> or the church of the Virgin, which was built in 1155<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>205.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the chief church were interred the princes and great men of <HI>Powys;</HI> among whom may be enumerated <HI>Madoc ap Meredydd ap Blyddyn ap Cynvyn,</HI> prince of <HI>Powys,</HI> who died in 1160, at <HI>Winchester,</HI> and was conveyed here; and the noble <HI>Gryffydd Maelor,</HI> lord of <HI>Bromefield,</HI> who died in 1188<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>210. 242.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE church-yard of the present is not less than nine acres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH-YARD.</NOTE> and yields to the minister as many pounds, as a pasture.</P>
<P>NOT far above <HI>Meivod</HI> is an union of two rivers, both of the name of <HI>Vyrnyw:</HI> both of them diverge considerably from each other, and take their rise remote from one another. The poeti∣cal topographer <HI>Draiton</HI> therefore very justly styles the river
<Q><L>FORKT <HI>Vurnway,</HI> bringing <HI>Tur</HI> and <HI>Tano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI> growing rank,</L>
<L>She plies her towards the <HI>pool</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Canto vi.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
Both are large streams, in many places black and deep. Soon beyond their junction the ground rises. On a steep bank, above one of the rivers, stood <HI>Mathraval,</HI> once the seat of the princes of <HI>Powis;</HI> the name at present preserved only by a farm-house.
<PB N="355" REF="383"/>
I could easily trace the site of the antient castle: it occupied the space of about two acres. One side was guarded by the steep over the river; the other three sides by a vast rampart of stone and earth, and a very deep foss: a high exploratory mount, on which perhaps had been a castelet, fills one corner; from which is a clear view of all that passes up and down the vale.</P>
<P>AFTER, this place was deserted by its princes, the castle was possessed, or, as Dr. <HI>Powel</HI> says, built by <HI>Robert de Vepont,</HI> a potent baron, high in favor with King <HI>John.</HI> It is most pro∣bable that he only restored, and strengthened it with new works. In 1112, <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth</HI> laid siege to it; but the king coming with a potent army, obliged <HI>Llewelyn</HI> to retire, and after that caused the castle to be demolished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Wales, <HI>267.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Gwern Ddu,</HI> a wood opposite to <HI>Mathraval,</HI> beyond the river, is a circular entrenchment; and in a field, beyond the other branch, is a round mount; both which certainly had re∣spect, in early times, to the fortress at <HI>Mathraval.</HI> I must therefore agree with the learned <HI>Burton</HI>'s conjecture, that this might have been the <HI>Mediolanum</HI> of the <HI>Romans;</HI> it having been customary with <HI>British</HI> as well as <HI>Saxon</HI> princes, to have their palaces where formerly <HI>Roman</HI> stations had their situation and being<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burton's Com. <HI>132.</HI></NOTE> Let me add also, that this might have been the win∣ter station; and the low <HI>Meivod,</HI> subject to overflowings from the river, the summer station.</P>
<P>THE country beyond <HI>Mathraval</HI> grows hilly, clayey, and barren. Pass by the church of <HI>Llangyniw;</HI> to the left is <HI>Dolar∣ddyn,</HI> where <HI>Henry</HI> VII. is said to have lodged a night.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="384"/>A FEW miles farther I rid through the village of <HI>Castell Caere∣neon,</HI> seated on the <HI>Vyrnyw.</HI> A castle was built here in 1155, by <HI>Madoc ap Meredydd,</HI> prince of <HI>Powys</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>205.</HI></NOTE>. I had not leisure to enquire whether there were any remains.</P>
<P>THE country for seven miles more continued hilly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CRYGYNNOG.</NOTE> and full of unpleasant commons. Reach <HI>Crygynnog,</HI> the seat of <HI>Arthur Blainey,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whose hospitality I experienced for two or three days. Under his conduct I saw every thing in the neighborhood which merited attention.

<P>ONE evening I was conducted to <HI>Castell Dolforwyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL DOL∣FORWYN.</NOTE> a castle on a high ridge of a hill, very steep, and almost surrounded by wooded dingle. At the bottom runs a small brook, which falls into the <HI>Severn</HI> about a mile distant. This fortress is very ruinous, being built with the small shattery stone of the country, and resembles much, in its masonry, <HI>Castell Dinas Bran.</HI> On the two more accessible sides are deep trenches, cut through the rock. It commands a fine view of the rich vale of <HI>Severn.</HI> According to <HI>Dugdale</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Monast. <HI>ii. 223.</HI></NOTE>, it was built by <HI>Dafydd ap Llewelyn,</HI> a prince who reigned from 1240 to 1246; but I prefer the authority of <HI>John Dafydd Rhys,</HI> quoted by the re∣verend Mr. <HI>Evan Evans</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dissertatio de Bardis, <HI>92.</HI></NOTE>; which assures us it was founded by that worthy prince <HI>Bleyddyn ap Cynvyn,</HI> between the years 1065

and 1073. <HI>Roger de Mortimer</HI> obtained a grant of it, together with the castles of <HI>Kedewen</HI> and <HI>Keri,</HI> from <HI>Edward</HI> I. in 1278, to hold to himself and his heirs, by the service of three knights fees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Baron, <HI>i. 142.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT is the origin of the name of <HI>Dolforwyn,</HI> or the Mea∣dow of the Maiden, I cannot with any certainty pronounce; but from some legendary tradition of the country, I suspect that it has allusion to the story of <HI>Sabra,</HI> or <HI>Sabrina,</HI> of which our poets have made so beautiful an use.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SABRINA, HER STORY.</NOTE> She was (says <HI>Jeffry</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI>) daughter of <HI>Locrine</HI> king of <HI>Britain,</HI> by <HI>Estrildis,</HI> one of the three captive virgins of <HI>matchless</HI> charms, which he took after he had defeated <HI>Humber</HI> king of the <HI>Huns,</HI> to whom they belonged. <HI>Locrine</HI> had divorced his former queen <HI>Guendolen</HI> in her favor. On the death of the <HI>British</HI> monarch, <HI>Guendolen</HI> assumed the government, pursued <HI>Estrildis,</HI> and <HI>Sabra</HI> her daughter, with unrelenting cruelty, and caused them to be drowned in the river; which, with a slight alteration, assumed the name of the innocent-victim. <HI>Milton,</HI> in his brief and ele∣gant description of our rivers, speaks of
<Q>The <HI>Severn</HI> swift, guilty of maiden's death.</Q>
But in his incomparable mask of <HI>Comus,</HI> he enters fully into her sad story, and makes her the goddess of Chastity, and calls her from the deep

<P>FROM hence, we descended into the vale of <HI>Severn,</HI> and cross the river on a wooden bridge. It is the misfortune of this part of the country to be destitute of several most necessary materials. The rich are obliged to burn wood instead of coal; and the poor, a wretched turf. Lime is extremely remote; and stone fit for masonry at a vast distance. From the head of the <HI>Severn,</HI> as low as <HI>Llandreinio,</HI> there is not a stone bridge. Should it happen, in any remote period, that timber should fail, the better sort of people must probably be reduced to distress for want of fuel; and at times one part of the country become inaccessible to the other for want of bridges.

<P>THE following day our ride was directed towards <HI>Caer Sws,</HI> a place of <HI>Roman</HI> antiquity. Our way lay over some high grassy lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN ROAD.</NOTE> On <HI>Gwyn Vynydd</HI> was easily traced the <HI>Roman</HI> road, called <HI>Sarn Swsan.</HI> It runs from <HI>Caer Sws,</HI> points towards <HI>Meivod,</HI> and is distinctly traced as far as the banks of the <HI>Vyr∣nyw,</HI> near <HI>Llyssin.</HI> I am not able to pursue it either to or from <HI>Meivod;</HI> but the late Dr. <HI>Worthington</HI> assured me, that it was met with in his parish, at <HI>Street Vawr,</HI> near <HI>Coed y Clawdd;</HI> that it crossed <HI>Rhôs y Brithdir</HI> to <HI>Pen y Street,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Llam-jwrch,</HI> to <HI>Caerfach,</HI> which is supposed to have been a small <HI>Roman</HI> camp. Dr. <HI>Worthington</HI> supposed, that this road tends to <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="390"/>NOTWITHSTANDING it is rather out of its place, let me speak of another road in the same parish, and mentioned to me by the same gentleman. This seems to lead from <HI>Rutunium, Rowton</HI> in <HI>Shropshire.</HI> It crosses the <HI>Tanat</HI> at <HI>Gartheryr;</HI> from whence it passes through <HI>Street y Planirau</HI> to <HI>Maen-gwynedd,</HI> and winds up <HI>Bwlch Maen Gwynedd,</HI> and retains the name of <HI>Ffordd Gam Elen,</HI> or the winding road of <HI>Helen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Worthington</HI>'s Letter, on his parish, addressed to me, <HI>Nov.</HI> 29th 1774.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Gwyn-vynydd.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAER SWS.</NOTE> I observed, on the side of the <HI>Roman</HI> road, a small sub-oval camp. The road conducts us to <HI>Caer Sws,</HI> a hamlet with a few houses, on the side of the <HI>Severn.</HI> The adjacent fields are divided, to this day, from each other by lanes, which intersect each other, as it were to point the very places which had formed the antient streets. On the north-west sides are hollows, which possibly were part of the fosses of the old precincts. Bricks have been found; one was presented to me, with letters that baffle my guess. The figure of them is given, for the conjecture of the more profound antiquary.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>As to coins, I have heard of only one being met with; and the
<PB N="363" REF="391"/>
owner could not ascertain to me the emperor. This station is unnoticed by every <HI>Roman</HI> writer.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RHOS DDIARBED.</NOTE> at some distance from the river, is <HI>Rhos Ddiar∣bed,</HI> or the common where <HI>no quarter was given.</HI> The reason is now lost. In an adjacent field is a camp of a very uncommon form. At the south is a vast exploratory mount, of a conic form, surrounded with a foss of a vast depth. On the north part of the foss is an oblong area, about seventy yards wide in the greatest diameter; guarded by a very high rampart, and on the outside by a ditch. In the lower part is a <HI>porta,</HI> open∣ing into a great rectangular camp, about two hundred yards long, and above one hundred broad. Opposite to the other <HI>porta</HI> is a second, placed at the extremity; but there are no others, as usual in <HI>Roman</HI> camps, which this certainly was, but an eccentric one, <HI>prout loci qualitas aut necessitas postulaverat.</HI> The whole is encompassed with a rampart and ditch. In a field opposite to <HI>Caer Sws</HI> are some trenches, perhaps relative to the camp. The former I suppose to have been the winter, this the summer station.</P>
<P>FROM hence I returned into the road. On the right opens another vale, watered by the <HI>Carno.</HI> The mountains of <HI>Carno,</HI> like the mountains of <HI>Gilboa,</HI> were celebrated for the fall of the mighty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE OF CARNO.</NOTE> The fiercest battle in our annals happened, in 1077, amidst these hills; when <HI>Gryffydd ap Cynan,</HI> supported by <HI>Rhys ap Tudur,</HI> prince of <HI>South Wales,</HI> disputed the sovereignty of <HI>North Wales</HI> with <HI>Trahaern ap Caradoc,</HI> the reigning prince, followed by <HI>Caradoc ap Gryffydd</HI> and <HI>Meilir,</HI> sons of <HI>Rywallon ap Gwyn,</HI> his cousin-germains. After a most bloody contest, vic∣tory declared itself; in favor of the first; <HI>Trahaern</HI> and his kins∣men,
<PB N="364" REF="392"/>
disdaining flight, fell on the spot; and <HI>Gryffydd ap Cynan</HI> was put into possession of his rightful throne, which he filled during fifty-seven years with great dignity.</P>
<P>The church of <HI>Carno</HI> belonged to the knights of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> who are said to have had a house near it. As one part of their business was the protection of their fellow-crea∣tures from violence, it is very possible that they might have had a station in these parts, which were long filled with a lawless <HI>banditti.</HI></P>
<P>IN view is <HI>Park,</HI> the residence of — <HI>Herbert,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> I have been informed that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> kept here a stud of horses. Possibly the famous breed of <HI>Spanish</HI> horses, introduced into the country by <HI>Robert</HI> earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willis's Bangor, <HI>291.</HI></NOTE>, might render these parts distinguished for an excellent kind, even so late as the reign of that great princess.</P>
<P>REACH <HI>Llanddinam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANDDINAM.</NOTE> a church, prettily seated on a little head∣land jutting into the vale. This is a vicarage belonging to the chapter of <HI>Bangor;</HI> and the comportions were vested in the dean and chapter in 1685, for repairing the cathedral, and aug∣menting the vicarages thereof<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Girald. Itin. Cambriae, <HI>lib. ii. c. 12.</HI></NOTE>. Opposite to <HI>Llanddinam,</HI> on the summit of a high mountain, is a <HI>British</HI> post, called <HI>Y Caer Vychan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Y CAER VYCHAN.</NOTE> or the Little Fortress, surrounded with a number of fosses, from one to five, according as the strength or weakness of the parts required.</P>
<P>MY journey was continued along a most beautiful road. The vale grows narrow, is bounded by lofty hills, whose bot∣toms are in many places skirted with beautiful hanging woods;
<PB N="365" REF="393"/>
those of <HI>Berth-Lwyd</HI> are far the most considerable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BERTH-LWYD.</NOTE> The poor remains of the antient house of that name stand in the valley; its masters were the old family of the <HI>Llwyds,</HI> descended from <HI>Dyngad,</HI> second son of <HI>Tudor Trevor. Dafydd,</HI> seventeenth in descent from <HI>Dungad,</HI> first took the name of <HI>Llwyd,</HI> and pro∣bably gave the additon of title to the house. It continued in the family several generations after; and of late years passed, by purchase, to Sir <HI>Edward Lloyd,</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile farther is <HI>Llanidlos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANIDLOS.</NOTE> a small town, with a great market for yarn, which is manufactured here into fine flannels; and sent weekly, by waggon-loads, to <HI>Welsh Pool.</HI> The church is dedicated to St. <HI>Idlos.</HI> Within are six arches: the columns surrounded with neat round pillars, ending in capitals of palm-leaves. The inhabitants assert, that they were brought from the abbey of <HI>Cwm Hîr</HI> in <HI>Radnorshire.</HI> A date on the roof is 1542, which soon followed the period of monastic ruin in this kingdom.</P>
<P>THIS is a country of sheepwalks. The flocks, like those of <HI>Spain,</HI> are driven to them from distant parts to feed on the summer herbage. The farms in the vallies are only appen∣dages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SLATE.</NOTE> for winter habitations and provisions. A coarse slate is found in the neighboring hills; but there still remains, in ma∣ny parts, the antient covering of the country, shingles, heart of oak split and cut into form of slates. This was introduced by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> as the word is derived from <HI>Schindel,</HI> which signifies the same thing.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond <HI>Llanidlos</HI> the vale closes. The <HI>Severn</HI> here dwindles into an inconsiderable stream. By wonderful instinct, Salmon force their way from the ocean, higher up even than
<PB N="366" REF="394"/>
this distant spot, for the sake of depositing their spawn. The other fish are Trouts, Samlets, Graylings, and Pike. The river runs in a hollow to its source, fifteen miles distant, in

the vast hill of <HI>Plynlimmon.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLYNLIMMON.</NOTE> I was dissuaded from making it a visit, being informed that it was an uninteresting object: the base most extensive, the top boggy, and the view over a dreary and an almost uninhabited country.

<P>AFTER a most pleasing ride, return to <HI>Cregynnan</HI> with my good host, the best shewer of a country I ever had the good fortune of meeting.</P>
<P>ON the morning I took leave of <HI>Cregynnan,</HI> and, attended by Mr. <HI>Blainy,</HI> skirt the hilly country. Our ride was chiefly through narrow lanes. Stop to see the church of <HI>Bettws,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BETTWS CHURCH.</NOTE> seated in a bottom, dedicated to St. <HI>Beuno,</HI> and formerly be∣longing to the nunnery of <HI>Llanlugan,</HI> in this county.

<P>This brass was originally fixed on a great slab of oak, still in its place on the floor, which also is covered with oak: so scarce was stone, so plentiful wood! The great chest is made of a single trunk of oak.</P>
<P>A LITTLE further, on the top of a hill on the left, is a great exploratory mount; and I was informed that on the same range is a post, called <HI>Pen y Gaer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PEN Y GAER.</NOTE> surrounded by three trenches.</P>
<P>FROM a hill, called <HI>Cefn Uppol,</HI> is a most delightful view of the vale of <HI>Severn,</HI> the river; and beyond appear the long ex∣tent of <HI>Cerri</HI> hills, even on the top, <HI>Corndon</HI> hill, <HI>Longment,</HI> the <HI>Tetterstones,</HI> and the rugged mass of <HI>Freiddin.</HI></P>

A little beyond, near the house of <HI>Nantcrib∣ba,</HI> the seat of Lord Viscount <HI>Hereford,</HI> rises a great conoid rock. A few years ago, on taking away the top, were disco∣vered the remains of a little fort;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A SMALL FORT.</NOTE> and on paring away the rubbish, it appeared to have been square, with a round tower probably at each corner: one is tolerably entire, and is only nine feet diameter within; the walls seven feet seven inches thick. There had been some small square rooms, with door∣cases of good free-stone: the rest of the building is of rough stone, cemented with clay. This place was probably ruined by fire; for I observed some melted lead, mixed with charcoal, and several pieces of vitrified stuff. There is no history rela∣tive to it. It must be very antient, for on the top is the stool of a vast oak. The base of the rock is surrounded with a ditch, cut through it, leaving only a narrow pass to the sort. At a dis∣tance is another trench. <HI>Offa</HI>'s ditch lies about two hundred yards from the rock. Enter a part of SHROPSHIRE, at <HI>Walcot;</HI> and, keeping southerly, soon reach <HI>Chirbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHIRBURY.</NOTE> a church and village, which give name to the hundred, and title to the celebrated flower of chivalry <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> in whom madness and abilities kept equal pace. This hundred did, in old times, belong to the castle of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> which was then reputed to be in it. In the 7th of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. <HI>Chirbury</HI> hun∣dred was given by the crown to <HI>Edward Herbert</HI> and his heirs; but <HI>Charles</HI> I. in the 3d year of his reign, permitted Sir <HI>Edward Herbert</HI> to alienate it to <HI>William Neye</HI> and <HI>Thomas Gardiner,</HI> <ABBR>Esqrs</ABBR></P>

Montgomery,</HI> earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> entered <HI>Powisland,</HI> and won the town and castle of <HI>Baldwyn;</HI> I suppose at that time possessed by the <HI>Welsh.

The king, <HI>William Rufus,</HI> as∣sembled a vast army, and repossessed himself of the low parts of the country. The earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> rebuilt the castle, which the <HI>Welsh</HI> had destroyed. It was again ruined; but we are not informed of the period: only we are told that <HI>Henry III.</HI> built a new castle there in 1221<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>280.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Henry</HI> granted it to his great justiciary <HI>Hubert de Burgh,</HI> with two hundred marks an∣nually, and a greater salary in case of war<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Baron. <HI>i. 695.</HI></NOTE>.

In 1231, <HI>Llewelyn</HI> assembled a great army, and so terrified <HI>Hubert</HI> that he evacuated the castle, which was seised and burnt by the exasperated prince<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>287.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

<P>I LEAVE a long interval before I discover any thing more of this place.

<P>IN the civil wars it was seised for the use of the parlement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIEGE IN 1644.</NOTE> by Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton,</HI> in 1644; who, on the appearance of the king's army, was obliged to make a sudden retreat to <HI>Os∣westry,</HI> and leave it ill provided both with garrison and pro∣visions. The royal forces, under Lord <HI>Biron,</HI> laid siege to it; but Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> being joined by Sir <HI>William Brereton,</HI> Sir <HI>John Meldrum,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Fairfax,</HI> returned, under the com∣mand of <HI>Brereton,</HI> with about three thousand men, to the relief of the place. The king's army was five thousand strong; who, on approach of the enemy, took possession of the hill above the castle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE SEPTEMBER 18TH.</NOTE> The castle was relieved, and a most bloody battle ensued. The king's army descended from their post, and, mak∣ing a most vigorous attack on the forces of the parlement, at first gained considerable advantage; but the last, actuated by despair, made the most violent efforts: at length, obtained a most complete victory. The pursuit was continued, near twen∣ty miles. Above five hundred were slain, and fourteen hun∣dred taken prisoners. The loss on the side of the parlement only forty slain, and about sixty wounded<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Drake's Parl. Hist. <HI>xiii. 285.</HI> Whitelock, <HI>104.</HI></NOTE>. The castle met
<PB N="372" REF="400"/>
with the fate of all others, being dismantled by order of the commons.</P>
<P>THE remains impend over the town.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE DE∣SCRIBED.</NOTE> They stand on a pro∣jecting ridge, of a great height and steepness, and, towards the end, quite precipitous. The reliques of this fortress are very small. It had been divided by four fosses cut in the rock; each perhaps had its draw-bridge. Between the end of the buildings and the precipice is a level spot, the yard or parade of the place.</P>
<P>AT the bottom of the hill, in the vale, is a small fortification, of the same kind with those used by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and by the <HI>Welsh</HI> also, having in it a high mount.</P>
<P>ON a hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRITISH POST.</NOTE> not far from the castle, is a stupendous <HI>British</HI> post. The approach is guarded by four great ditches, with two or three entrances towards the main work; where two or three fosses run across the hill, the end of which is sufficiently guard∣ed by the steepness.</P>
<P>THIS, and the preceding pieces of military antiquity, shew the importance of this place in early times: the first was pro∣bably in being when <HI>Baldwyn</HI> made himself master of this country, notwithstanding the original name has totally pe∣rished.</P>
<P>FROM the summit of the <HI>British</HI> post is a fine view of the vale of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> which is very extensive, and bounded by the hills of <HI>Shropshire.</HI></P>
<P>THE town was once defended by walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN.</NOTE> strengthened by towers. It had also four gates; <HI>Chirbury, Arthur's, Keri,</HI> and <HI>Kedewen</HI> gate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland Itin. <HI>vii. 16.</HI></NOTE>. There was a grant of <HI>Edward</HI> I. to <HI>Bogo de

The first burgess that was summoned to parlement was in the 27th of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. The first who appears to have sat was <HI>William Herbert,</HI> in the year 1542. The town is go∣verned by two bailiffs, and twelve burgesses, or common-coun∣cil-men. The member is elected by the burgesses, and returned by the bailiffs. The electors are about eighty<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willis, Notitia Parl. <HI>iii. 78. and part ii. 9.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Llanidlos, Welsh Pool,</HI> and <HI>Llanvyllin,</HI> were contributory; but are now excluded from any share in the election.</P>
<P>WHETHER, in old times, this town abounded, more than is usual, with ladies of free lives and conversation, I do not pre∣tend to say; but very early the free burgesses had the privi∣leges of the <HI>Gogingstoole, Cuckingstool,</HI> or <HI>Cokestool,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GOGINGSTOOLE.</NOTE> or, what the <HI>Saxons</HI> called the <HI>Scealfing-stole.

<P>THE church is dedicated to St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> is in the diocese of <HI>Hereford,</HI> in the gift of the king; and formerly a chapel to <HI>Chirbury.</HI> Within is a handsome monument of <HI>Richard Her∣bert,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> father to the famous Lord <HI>Herbert.</HI> He is repre∣sented in armour; and by him lies his lady, <HI>Magdalene,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Richard Newport</HI> of <HI>High Arcol.</HI> In front are their nu∣merous progeny.

<P><PB N="375" REF="403"/>I MUST add, that on this mountain <HI>Henry</HI> VII. mustered the friends who promised to join him from <HI>North Wales</HI> and <HI>Shrop∣shire,</HI> and did not find one who had failed of his appointment.

This retains a mixture of castle and mansion. You enter between two rounders: there are also remains of round towers in other parts. Near the castle is a long gallery, a hundred and seventeen feet by twenty. It was once a hundred and sixty-seven feet; but an apartment has been taken out of one end.

<P>PASS by <HI>Garth,</HI> the seat of <HI>Devereux Mytton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Go by the small church of <HI>Llandysilio,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANDYSILIO.</NOTE> a chapel in <HI>Llandrinio</HI> parish; and soon after ford the <HI>Vyrnyw,</HI> and deviate a little from my intended route along the banks of the <HI>Severn,</HI> to visit the public-spirited Mr. <HI>Evans,</HI> of <HI>Llwyn y Groes,</HI> near <HI>Llanymynach;</HI> who, in a most disinterested manner, at his own hazard, is undertaking a beau∣tiful map of <HI>North Wales.</HI> Continue at his house till morning, and, in his company, <NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANYMYNACH.</NOTE> visit <HI>Llanymynach.</HI> The church and village stand in a pretty situation, on a bank above the <HI>Vyrnyw;</HI> and very advantageous for trade. It lies at the opening of three val∣lies, at the intersection of two great public roads, and on a river navigable into the <HI>Severn,</HI> (which runs only three miles from the place) for some months in the year, for barges of fifty tons. Great quantities of slates are sent from hence to <HI>Bristol;</HI> and, of late years, up the <HI>Stourport</HI> canal, to <HI>Birmingham,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>ASCEND <HI>Llanymynach</HI> hill, <NOTE PLACE="marg">HILL.</NOTE> a vast rock, with the surface co∣vered with a verdant turf; beneath which is a pearl-colored marble, beautifully veined with red, and streaked with white, and capable of a good polish. This is the limestone of the place. <NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT LIME∣WORKS.</NOTE> The quantity burnt on this hill is inconceivable, and the increase is ten times greater since the improvement of the
<PB N="382" REF="410"/>
<HI>Montgomeryshire</HI> roads; for it is carried even for manure thirty miles into that county. The season of carriage begins in <HI>March,</HI> and ends in <HI>October.</HI> The hill is of a considerable length and breadth: slopes upwards from the side next to the village, and on the upper part ends in a vast and long precipice. Its bowels are probably replete with minerals.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MINERALS.</NOTE> Copper, lead ore, and calamine, have been found there of late years; but there are undeniable proofs of its having been worked by the <HI>Romans.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">WORKED BY THE ROMANS.</NOTE> In a great artificial cave, formed into several mean∣ders in search of the ores, have been discovered <HI>Roman</HI> coins; among them, an <HI>Antoninus</HI> and a <HI>Faustina.</HI> Near the coins were found the skeleton of a man at full length: on his left arm a bracelet, and by his side a battle-ax. Burnt bones and ashes are often found on the hill; and near the north-west part of the precipice are numbers of large pits, in form of inverted cones, supposed to have been the work of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>ON the slope of the hill, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT DIKES AND FOSSES.</NOTE> in the more accessible part, runs, from top to bottom, a stupendous rampart of loose stones, with a foss at the foot of it; and at certain, distances beyond are two other parallel fosses, in many places cut through the rock with vast labor. It has been thought that the <HI>Romans</HI> were the peo∣ple who made these works; but I rather think them to have been <HI>British,</HI> as they are so similar to those which constitute the strength of the <HI>British</HI> post. <HI>Offa</HI>'s dike may be traced on this hill; but is plainly different from the others. The wall of the church-yard is placed on the former.</P>
<P>FROM the summit of the hill is a most delightful view: one way, of the vast flat of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> with its various rising boun∣daries. The <HI>Freiddin</HI> hills form a noble group opposite to this
<PB N="383" REF="411"/>
eminence; which together rise most magnificently, like two great capes, at the entrance into the vale of <HI>Severn;</HI> which, from hence to <HI>Llanidlos,</HI> is between thirty and forty miles in length.</P>
<P>THE view to the south is into <HI>Montgomeryshire;</HI> and is a series of little vales, lodged between small wooded risings. A plain lies immediately beneath the precipice of the hill, finely watered, by the <HI>Tanat</HI> and the <HI>Vyrnyw,</HI> there uniting. Immediately be∣neath the rock is <HI>Blodwell Hall,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">BLODWELL HALL.</NOTE> a deserted seat, once the pro∣perty of the <HI>Tanats;</HI> conveyed to the <HI>Matthews</HI> by the marriage of <HI>Jane,</HI> daughter and heiress of <HI>Maurice Tanat.</HI> The pro∣perty was again transferred, by the marriage of <HI>Ursula,</HI> daughter and heiress of <HI>Roger Matthew,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Bridgeman,</HI> Baronet, grandfather to the present owner.</P>
<P>NOT far from hence stood the castle of <HI>Carreg Hwva,</HI> a place of which I know nothing more, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CARREG HWVA CASTLE</NOTE> than that it had been taken and pillaged, in 1162, by <HI>Owen Cyveilioc</HI> and <HI>Owen ap Madoc ap Meredydd</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>219.</HI></NOTE> It was soon restored; for in the year 1187, the last was slain here in the night, by <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> and <HI>Cadwallon,</HI> the sons of his former collegue <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, <HI>241.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Llanymynach</HI> I rode to the <HI>New Bridge,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW BRIDGE.</NOTE> a bridge of seven arches, over the <HI>Vyrnyw,</HI> about three miles above the ford. The river is kept confined by a dam, for the sake of a mill, and forms a fine reach. The overflowing makes a pretty cascade; and the views upwards, of small vallies and hanging woods, are exceedingly beautiful.</P>
<P>THE river merits the title of <HI>Piscosus Amnis,</HI> as much as any I know. <NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH OF THE VYRNYW AND TANAT.</NOTE> The number of fish which inhabit it, animate the

<P>AFTER crossing the <HI>Severn,</HI> my road lay at the foot of that great mass of rocky mountains, distinguished by the names of <HI>Freiddin, Moel y Gollfa,</HI> and <HI>Cevn y Castell.</HI> Their bases are prettily skirted with woods; above which the mountains sud∣denly present a most tremendous and precipitous front. On <HI>Crew</HI> green, far to the left, starts up <HI>Belin Mount,</HI> a round in∣sulated rock, remote from its congenial hills. See beneath me a vast extent of flat and wet country, the great plain of part of <HI>Shropshire.</HI> The village and parish of <HI>Melverly</HI> lie on the opposite side of the <HI>Severn,</HI> near the place where the <HI>Vyrnyw</HI> is discharged into it.

<P>NEAR a small brook, quit <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> and enter the county of SALOP, OR SHROPSHIRE. Visit, a little to the right, <HI>Wattleburg</HI> castle, an old house, with a square tower of far more antient date. It lies on the <HI>Roman</HI>

At the time of the conquest, <HI>Edric</HI> possessed it. <HI>Roger Corbet,</HI> son of <HI>Corbet</HI> a noble <HI>Norman,</HI> succeeded him. Afterwards it was given to a younger son of the <HI>Corbets</HI> of <HI>Caux</HI> castle. It conti∣nued long in that family.

<P>A LITTLE to the east of <HI>Alberbury</HI> is <HI>Routon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROUTON.</NOTE> the seat of the <HI>Listers,</HI> a family long resident here.

<P>FROM hence I turned towards the <HI>Severn;</HI> and, on a lofty bank above the river, at <HI>Little Shrawardine,</HI> saw a vast artificial mount, the former site of some castelet.

But in the next reign his attainder was reversed, and his for∣tunes restored to his son. <HI>Henry,</HI> last earl of the family, sold it to Sir <HI>Thomas Bromley,</HI> lord chancellor of <HI>England;</HI> who, in 1582, with the queen's licence, settled it on Sir <HI>George Bromley,</HI> Knight, and his heirs.

They are both in the parish of <HI>St. Mary, Shrewsbury.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SHREWSBURY.</NOTE> My entrance into the town was through the <HI>North Gate;</HI> which,
<PB N="393" REF="421"/>
for greater security, in reality consists of two gates, at a small distance from one another, with a round tower on each side.</P>
<P>THE castle stands on an eminence on the left.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> Only one part with two rounders remain, and the walls of the north and east∣ern sides. The keep was on a large artificial mount; which shews this fortress to have been of <HI>Saxon</HI> or <HI>British</HI> origin, not∣withstanding the foundation is ascribed to the great earl of <HI>Shrewsbury, Roger de Montgomery.</HI> The inside is cleared from buildings, excepting one house. The whole castle-yard is a garden; and the mount is at present admirable only for its beau∣tiful view.</P>
<P>THE town of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> is seated within a peninsula, with the ground finely sloping, in most parts, to the river. The castle was judiciously placed on a narrow <HI>isthmus,</HI> two hundred yards wide, which connects it to the main land. <HI>Roger de Montgome∣ry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOUNDED BY ROGER DE MONT∣GOMERY.</NOTE> on whom almost the whole county was bestowed by the Conqueror, besides a hundred and fifty-eight manors in other parts of the kingdom, made this his principal seat. In order to extend his fortifications, he demolished forty-one houses; for this part of the town, at that period, was very populous. These houses paid taxes; yet no remittance was made to the owners, notwithstanding the greatness of their loss. The first constable was <HI>Warine the Bald,</HI> a man of small stature, but great courage. This place continued in the possession of the two sons of <HI>Roger de Montgomery: Hugh,</HI> who was slain in <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and that mon∣ster of cruelty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dugdale Baron <HI>i. 31.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Robert,</HI> surnamed <HI>de Belesme;</HI> who, after various struggles, was at length obliged to surrender this place, his
<PB N="394" REF="422"/>
honors, and all his mighty possessions, into the hands of his sovereign, <HI>Henry</HI> I. As soon as it became a royal fortress, the lands and demesnes, which followed it, were parceled out into serjeanties for its defence. Thus <HI>Robert,</HI> the son of <HI>Adam de Leyton,</HI> was obliged by his tenure to continue in this castle fifteen days, <HI>cum una balista,</HI> with one cross-bow; and <HI>William de Wichard</HI> held the manor of <HI>Cold Hatton,</HI> to keep ward in this castle, at his own expence, twenty days, in time of war, <HI>cum uno equo, lorica, capello ferreo, et lancea.</HI> The constables were usu∣ally men of the first note; and very often it was committed to the care of the sheriff of the county. After it had been dis∣mantled in the civil wars, it was granted by <HI>Charles</HI> II. to <HI>Francis</HI> lord viscount <HI>Newport,</HI> afterwards earl of <HI>Bradford.</HI> In our times, it got into the hands of <HI>Pulteney</HI> earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> and is now in those of <HI>William Pulteney,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P>THE first attempt towards the walls of this town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLS.</NOTE> was made by <HI>Robert de Belesme;</HI> who, to defend it against the king's forces, then marching against him, drew a wall from each side of the castle across the isthmus to the water-side. One is still remaining, and, as I have been informed, terminated with a square tower: both these walls are preserved in <HI>Speed</HI>'s plan of the place. The town was not defended by walls till the year 1219; when <HI>Henry</HI> III. strongly urged the inhabitants to con∣sider of some means of defence against an enemy. At first he made them a grant of various small tolls; but at length, find∣ing those insufficient, was obliged to assist them: but the work went on so slowly, that they were not completed in less than thirty-two years. The town was paved in the next reign, by the assistance of certain customs granted for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="423"/>IN almost every part, the original walls were at a distance from the river. Those on the south-east side of the town are kept in good repair, and form pleasant but interrupted walks, by reason of flights of steps. Those on the north-west side are entirely covered with houses. Beneath them is a narrow field, extending from the School to the <HI>Welsh Bridge;</HI> along the verge of which, close to the river, in 1645, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ROWSHILL WALL.</NOTE> was built another wall, called <HI>Rowshill</HI> wall: the materials of which are said to have been brought from <HI>Shrawardine</HI> castle.</P>
<P>THERE are many historical evidences of the antiquity of the town.<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN.</NOTE> It had been, for many ages, the capital of <HI>Powis-land,</HI> and the seat of the princes. <HI>Brochmail Yscithroc,</HI> who lived about the year 607, is said to have had his palace on the spot where St. <HI>Chad</HI>'s church now stands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>22.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Welsh</HI> called it <HI>Pen-Gwern,</HI> or the Head of the Alder-groves; and <HI>Ymwithig,</HI> or the <HI>Delight,</HI> I suppose, of our princes. The period in which the town arose, is not certainly known; but it is supposed to have been on the ruin of the <HI>Roman Uriconium,</HI> the <HI>Vreken Ceaster</HI> of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and the modern <HI>Wroxeter,</HI> a small village, about four miles from hence, upon the <HI>Severn;</HI> where may be still seen a large fragment of the antient wall.</P>
<P>IN the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, <NOTE PLACE="marg">IN SAXON TIMES.</NOTE> <HI>Scrobbes Byrig,</HI> as the <HI>Saxons</HI> called it, was a considerable place. At that period there were two hundred and fifty-two houses, and the burgesses paid yearly 7<HI>l.</HI> 16<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> in excise. Whenever the king lay in the town, twelve of the chief inhabitants kept watch about his per∣son; and if he came there to hunt, the better sort of burgesses,
<PB N="396" REF="424"/>
who kept horses, rode armed as his guard, and the sheriff sent thirty-six footmen for their support, while the king was resident among them. When the king left the town, the sheriff sent twenty-four horses to <HI>Lenteurde,</HI> to conduct him to the first stage in <HI>Staffordshire.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the sheriff went against the <HI>Welsh,</HI> which he had fre∣quent occasion of doing, it was customary to summon thirty-six men at <HI>Marseteley</HI> park, to give their service for eight days. Those who neglected to go, forfeited forty shillings.</P>
<P>THE king had here three masters of the mint, who, like the other coiners of the county, were obliged to pay him twenty shillings at the end of fifteen days, while the money was out of the mint, and while it was current. The town paid in all twenty pounds yearly: the king had two-thirds, the sheriff one. As soon as the <HI>Norman</HI> reign commenced, it paid to its new earl forty pounds.</P>
<P>THE first charter extant (for that of <HI>Henry</HI> I. is lost) was one in 1189, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARTERS.</NOTE> from <HI>Richard</HI> I. It confirms all its antient customs and privileges; for which the town was to pay forty marks in silver, including ten for the purpose of providing a brace of hunters for the royal personage. It likewise grants to the burgesses the town and all its appurtenances, which had been seized by <HI>Henry</HI> I. on the forfeiture of Earl <HI>Robert.</HI> King <HI>John,</HI> in 1199, enlarged their charter, permitting the citizens to elect two substantial discreet persons of their body as bailiffs for the government of the town; and that the common-council might chuse four others, to determine all pleas of the crown in the corporation, and to be a check on the bailiffs themselves. Various other charters, with additional privileges, were granted by succeeding princes,
<PB N="397" REF="425"/>
till Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> made it a body corporate; and <HI>Charles</HI> I. confirmed and enlarged her royal charter. It now consists of a mayor, twenty-four aldermen, and forty-eight assistants, who are called the common-council. They have also a recorder; two chamberlains, annually chosen by the mayor, aldermen, and assistants; a steward, a sword-bearer, and three serjeants at mace.</P>
<P>THIS town sent members from the beginning. The right of voting rests in burgesses living in the town, and paying to church and poor, according to a resolution of the house in 1709; but in 1714, it was resolved that foreign burgesses had a right to vote.</P>
<P>THERE is in this town no manufacture considerable enough to merit mention; but it draws very great profit from those of <HI>Montgomeryshire.</HI> This place is the chief mart for them. About 700,000 yards of <HI>Welsh</HI> webs, a coarse kind of woollen cloth, are brought here annually, to the <HI>Thursday</HI> market; and bought up and dressed, that is, the wool is raised on one side, by a set of people called <HI>Shearmen.</HI> At this time only forty are em∣ployed; but in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the trade was so great, that not fewer than six hundred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson's Dict. <HI>i. 405.</HI></NOTE> maintained themselves by this occupation. The cloth is sent chiefly to <HI>America,</HI> to clothe the Negroes; or to <HI>Flanders,</HI> where it is used by the pea∣sants.</P>
<P>FLANNELS, both coarse and fine, are brought every other <HI>Monday</HI> (except when fairs intervene) to <HI>Welsh Pool;</HI> and are chiefly consumed in <HI>England,</HI> to the amount of about 7 or
<PB N="398" REF="426"/>
800,000 yards. The <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> drapers go every market to <HI>Welsh Pool,</HI> for the sake of this commerce.</P>
<P>THE disposition of the streets in <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> is extremely irre∣gular, <NOTE PLACE="marg">STREETS.</NOTE> as is the case with all antient towns not of <HI>Roman</HI> origin. Many of the buildings are old; but the modern buildings are in general scattered in various places.</P>
<P>THE free-school stands near the castle, in a broad handsome street.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FREE-SCHOOL.</NOTE> It was founded by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. in 1552; who endowed it with tithes, at that time amounting to 20<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> and empower∣ed the bailiffs, burgesses, and their successors, to appoint one schoolmaster, and one under-schoolmaster; and, with the con∣sent of the bishop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> to frame statutes for its govern∣ment. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> added considerably to the endowments, so that at present the revenues are very large. The build∣ing was originally of wood; but in 1595, a beautiful and ex∣tensive edifice of stone arose in its place, which contains the school, houses for the masters, and a library filled with a va∣luable collection of books, and several curiosities; among them are three large sepulchral stones, discovered by ploughing at <HI>Wroxeter.</HI></P>
<P>The first has on its summit a pine-cone between two lions, and beneath the pediment, a rose. The first is taken from the <HI>Picea,</HI> what <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Feralis Arbor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Picea</HI>—Feralis Arbor, et funebri indicio ad fores posita, ac rogis virens. <HI>Hist. Nat.</HI> lib. xvi. c. 10.</NOTE>, expressive of the me∣lancholy subject, and not infrequent on memorials of this kind. Such was the great brass cone, five yards high, which stood on the top of the mausoleum of <HI>Adrian,</HI> now the tower of St. <HI>Angelo,</HI>
<PB N="399" REF="427"/>
and is still preserved in the garden of the <HI>Belvedere</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Flaminius Vacca, <HI>in</HI> Montfaucon's travels, Engl. <HI>ed. 322.</HI> Wright's travels, <HI>i. 273.</HI></NOTE> The in∣scription denotes the death of C. MANNIVS SECUNDUS, of the town of <HI>Pollentia,</HI> a <HI>Beneficiarius</HI> or veteran in the xxth legion, who had served his time, and was called again into service by the entreaties of a chief legate.</P>
<P>THE second stone has on the upper part a human face, two dolphins, and two serpents. Beneath are three pannels. In the first is commemorated, by her husband, <HI>Placida,</HI> aged fifty-five, and thirty years his wife. In the next is an inscription to <HI>Deuccus,</HI> a boy fifteen years old, son to the same person: <HI>Cur. agente patre.</HI> The third pannel is a blank; so it is probable (as was hinted to me by a most ingenious friend) that the man, who had erected this monument, designed to have been buried in the same place with his wife and son; but dying elsewhere, this pannel remains unfilled.</P>
<P>The third stone is inscribed to <HI>M. Petronius,</HI> signifer, or standard-bearer to the <HI>Legio quatuor decima gemina,</HI> or the four∣teenth double legion; or a legion in which two had been formed into one. As this legion never was in <HI>Britain,</HI> the learned Dr. <HI>Ward</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his account of these three stones in the <HI>Ph. Tr.</HI> xlix. part i. 196.</NOTE> guesses, that <HI>Petronius</HI> only came for his health, and died here.</P>
<P>A PRETTY wooden model of a hypocaust, discovered at the same place with the stones, is also preserved here.</P>

<P>Two bridges connect this peninsula with the country. <NOTE PLACE="marg">WELSH BRIDGE.</NOTE> The <HI>Welsh Bridge</HI> is a very antient structure, of six arches; with a very handsome embattled gateway at one end.

<P>ON an eminence above <HI>Frankwel,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">MILLINGTON'S HOSPITAL.</NOTE> a suburb beyond the bridge, stands <HI>Millington</HI>'s hospital, a handsome brick building, founded in 1734, by the will of Mr. <HI>James Millington</HI> of this town, <HI>Drapier.</HI> It maintains twelve poor housekeepers of <HI>Frankwel</HI> (single persons) and a charity-school for twenty boys and twenty girls of the same district, if to be found there; and if not, to be taken out of the nearest part of the parish of St. <HI>Chad:</HI> there to be instructed, and fitted for trades suitable to their stations; to have prayers constantly read, morning and evening, on school-days, (for which the chaplain is to have twenty pounds a year); and finally, they are to be decently cloathed twice a year. The poor housekeepers are to receive 3<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> a year apiece, a load of coal, and a new coat, or gown, annually. These poor people are to be, on vacancy, elected out of ten others, properly qualified; who, till their election, are to receive likewise, annually, a new coat, or gown, apiece. Mr. <HI>Millington</HI> besides founded in <HI>Magdalen</HI> college, <HI>Cambridge,</HI> two exhibitions of forty pounds a year for two scholars, to be elect∣ed from his grammar-school; and when in orders, one of them is to be elected chaplain of the school, in the room of the cler∣gyman who happens not to be so qualified, and who must, in that case, resign. The founder was a true churchman; for all dis∣senters, and all persons not truly orthodox, are to be excluded.</P>
<P>THE new bridge is on the side of the town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW BRIDGE.</NOTE> and is a very handsome building, of seven arches. It was begun in 1769, and built by subscription, under the direction of Mr. <HI>Gwyn,</HI> architect, a native of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> This succeeded a very an∣tient
<PB N="402" REF="430"/>

<P>NOT far from hence, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBEY.</NOTE> on the side of the river, stood the great mitred abbey of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> founded in 1083 by <HI>Roger</HI> earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and his countess Adelissa. It was built on the site of a timber church, erected by <HI>Siward;</HI> who exchanged it, and probably the ground about it, with the earl for the village of <HI>Langafielda;</HI> which <HI>Siward,</HI> at his death, bequeathed to the new foundation. It was peopled with <HI>Benedictine</HI> monks from <HI>Seez,</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> who arrived hungry and naked. <HI>Roger</HI> himself, with the permission of his lady, was shorn, and became a monk of his own abbey, and enriched it with the coat of St. <HI>Hugh,</HI> of the monastery of <HI>Cluni;</HI> which he sometimes wore himself as a most precious relique. He endowed the house largely, and encouraged every body who held under him to do the same. Among the after endowments, I smile at these good men receiving from earl <HI>Hugh</HI> the tithe of all the venison in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> except such which ranged in the woods of <HI>Wenlock.</HI> The founder died in 1094, and was interred here, as was his son <HI>Hugh,</HI> slain in <HI>Anglesey.

<P>IN so great a length of time the church underwent great alte∣rations. Some of the round arches are to be seen within, and some of the doors are of the same species of architecture; most of the other parts are more modern.

<P>THE <HI>Grey Friers,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">FRANCISCANS.</NOTE> or <HI>Franciscans,</HI> had a house a little to the south of the new bridge, not far from the town-walls. It was founded on the motion <HI>Hawyse,</HI> daughter of <HI>Owen ap Gryffydd,</HI> prince of <HI>Powys,</HI> and wife to <HI>John Charleton,</HI> lord of <HI>Powys</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland, Itin.</NOTE> <HI>Charleton</HI> died in the year 1353; <HI>Hawyse</HI> before him, and was interred in this convent.

<P>A LITTLE farther is that beautiful walk the <HI>Quarry,</HI> border∣ing on the river, and planted with rows of trees. It is the property of the corporation, and the pasturage part let to the inhabitants, and the profits distributed to the burgesses. In 1569 this ground was set to three persons for ten years, for the annual acknowlegement of a red rose, on condition they brought water in leaden pipes, as high as it would run, for the use of the town, from <HI>Brodwel</HI> near <HI>Crow Meole;</HI> which was effected in 1579.</P>
<P>ON a lofty bank, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ORPHAN-HOUSE.</NOTE> opposite to these walks, is seated the Orphan-house, a fine brick building, with thirteen windows in front, and two small wings. It was begun in 1760, and designed to receive part of the foundlings from the great hospital in <HI>London.</HI> They were first to have been put out to nurse in the neighborhood, and at a proper age to have been brought into the house, and under proper masters and mistresses to be taught such arts as would make them useful members of society. On the decline of the capital hospital, this great building became useless and is at present no more than a place of confinement for prisoners of war.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="434"/>BEYOND the quarry, <NOTE PLACE="marg">AUGUSTINES.</NOTE> close to the river, stood the house of <HI>Augustine</HI> friers. <HI>Leland</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Itin.</HI> iv. 100.</NOTE> says, it was founded by one of the <HI>Staffords;</HI> and that several persons of note, slain in the battle of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> were interred here, and in the church of the <HI>Black</HI> friers. The friers of this house lay under a very bad fame; it is even said, that a neighboring lane took its name from their noc∣turnal amours. Dr. <HI>Powel</HI> seems to think, that the celebrated <HI>Incubi</HI> were nothing more than mendicant friers; who might encourage the notion, in order to remove scandal from them∣selves, and their religious paramours. <HI>Hi,</HI> says the zealous an∣notator, <HI>Incubi daemones ita religiosas virgines illis diebus opprime∣bant, ut nulla eos crucis signatio, nec aqua benedicta, nec ipsum cor∣poris</HI> CHRISTI <HI>sacramentum, abigere valeret</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Girald, Camb.

<P>The house of the <HI>Black</HI> friers, or <HI>Dominicans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DOMINICANS.</NOTE> stood near St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, <HI>Water Lane.</HI> It is said that <HI>Richard,</HI> a burgess of this town, by the king's licence, built them a church in 1264; but the foundation of the friery is ascribed to <HI>Maud</HI> Lady <HI>Genevil,</HI> wife of <HI>Jeffry</HI> Lord <HI>Genevil,</HI> who lived in the reigns of <HI>Henry</HI> III. and <HI>Edward</HI> I.

money in his pocket, and attempting to escape, was drowned in fording the river, near the stone bridge. In this church is the monument of <HI>Richard Onslow</HI> and his wife, with their figures recumbent: he dressed in a bonnet and gown.

It is small, and only remarkable for the vast size of one side of the roof. It had the honor of receiving the bones of St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI> before they were deposited in the shrine in the abbey. It is called in Doomsday book, the parish of the city<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Philips, <HI>84.</HI></NOTE>; which gives it stronger clame to antiquity than any of the others.

<P>AMONG the more remarkable civil transactions may be rec∣koned the parlements held in this town. The first was sum∣moned formally by writ. By the first, the lords to appear on <HI>September</HI> 13th 1283; the second writ directed the commonal∣ty of every county to chuse two knights; the third, to the
<PB N="407" REF="436"/>
cities and boroughs; the fourth, to the judges. At this august assembly was tried and condemned <HI>David,</HI> brother to <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> last prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> his perfidy to <HI>Edward,</HI> and his treasons to his country, before his reconciliation with his brother, ren∣dered him an object of detestation. Eleven earls, and an hun∣dred barons, were commissioned to try him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drake's Parl. Hist. <HI>i. 89</HI></NOTE>, as a subject of <HI>England;</HI> for he had received from <HI>Edward</HI> a barony, and a considerable pension. He was the first who suffered the death of a traitor, in the form of the sentence now in use; which he underwent in its fullest extent.</P>
<P>ANOTHER parlement was held here in 1397; it was called the <HI>Great Parlement,</HI> on account of the number of people assem∣bled in it. Here the unfortunate <HI>Richard,</HI> by this obsequious senate, obtained a stretch of power unknown before; and, by a strange concession, obtained that the whole power of the nation should devolve on the king, twelve peers, and six commoners. The Pope's bull was thought necessary to confirm so irregular a proceeding<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rapin, <HI>i. 469.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE military transactions relative to this place were nume∣rous; but so brief, and so rapid, that I shun mention of all, except three. <NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE OF SHREWSBURY.</NOTE> The first was the important battle on St. <HI>Magda∣lene</HI>'s eve, <HI>July</HI> 22d 1403, which is best known by the name of that of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> between <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and the brave <HI>Henry Percy,</HI> surnamed <HI>Hotspur.</HI> It was the design of the northern insurgents to make themselves masters of this town, and here to strengthen their forces by a junction with the great <HI>Glyndwr</HI> and his countrymen. They made rapid marches through <HI>Lich∣field</HI>
<PB N="408" REF="437"/>
and <HI>Stafford;</HI> but the active <HI>Henry,</HI> stimulated by the advice of the earl of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> nobleman, then in his army, ad∣vanced with a speed which saved his crown, and proved the destruction of his enemies. He flung himself into <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> as some assert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>329,</HI></NOTE>, at the instant that the insurgents were going to scale the walls. He immediately quitted the town, and en∣camped before the gates. The high spirit of <HI>Percy</HI> would not suffer him to wait till the arrival of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> who was no farther dis∣tant than <HI>Oswestry:</HI> so that only four thousand of the <HI>Welsh</HI> were able to join the northern forces. <HI>Percy</HI> sent that night <HI>Thomas Kaiton</HI> and <HI>Thomas Salvaigne,</HI> two of his esquires, with a most reproachful manifesto, concluding, in the romantic manner of the times, with hurling defiance in his teeth. <Q>WE defy thee, <NOTE PLACE="marg">DEFIANCE.</NOTE> thy fautoures and compliers, as common traytours, and de∣stroyers of the realme, and the invadours, oppressours, and confounders of the verie true and right heyres to the crowne of <HI>Englande;</HI> which thing we entende with our handes to prove this daie, Almyghty GOD helpyng us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Halle,</HI> fol. xxii.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THE fight began early in the morning, and very near to the town; for the spirited <HI>Percy</HI> had made his advances much sooner and nearer than the king expected. The onset was made in <HI>Oldfield,</HI> or <HI>Bulfield,</HI> at a small distance beyond a little brook, north of the north-gate; and the battle raged towards <HI>Berwick</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carte,</HI> ii. 659.</NOTE>, and as far as what is now called <HI>Battlefield.</HI> Let the old historians paint the conflict in their plain but animated language.</P>

It had many of the symptoms of the plague; restlessness, anxiety, sick∣ness, ravings, drowsiness, faintness, palpitations; but it never was attended with eruptive spots, buboes, or carbuncles, attend∣ant on the other scourge of heaven. It always began with the affection of one part, the sense of a hot vapor running through the whole limb. The crisis never exceeded twenty-four hours; Dr. <HI>Caius,</HI> on that account, calls it <HI>Ephemera Britannica:</HI> but oftener death ensued in three or ten.

Forty dismounted troopers scaled the walls in a low part near the council-house, supported by the mus∣queteers, and three hundred and fifty foot surprised the main-guard in the market-place, and killed the captain. The castle fore-gate was next secured, and the draw-bridge let down for the admittance of the horse.

Hist. <HI>i. 100, 101.</HI></NOTE> In this office he died, and was carried to be interred in his cathedral at <HI>Wells.</HI> He was of a very antient family, dignified with barons, or knights, from the time of the Conquest; but he had acquired great wealth, which he laid out with true munificence. By certain monuments with the arms of the family, in the church of <HI>Burnel</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> it is supposed that they came originally from that country. The castle was honored by a session of parlement in 1284: the lords sate in the fortress, the commons in a great barn, the gable ends of which are still to be seen. The <HI>Statutum de Mercatoribus,</HI> enacted here, is, from the place, known by the name of the statute of <HI>Acton Burnel.</HI> It is probable that it was by the influence of the prelate, that his habitation was so distinguished.</P>
<P>HIS successor in the castle was Sir <HI>Edward Burnel,</HI> who served in many actions in <HI>Scotland,</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> I. and appeared with great splendor. He was always attended with a chariot decked with banners; on which, as well as on the trappings of his horses, were depicted his arms. He married <HI>Alice,</HI> daughter of Lord <HI>Despenser,</HI> by whom he had no issue. On his decease, in 1315, his sister <HI>Maud</HI> became sole heir. She married first <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Lovel</HI> of <HI>Tichemersh,</HI> surnamed <HI>The Rich;</HI> he died in 1335. Her second husband was <HI>John de Handlow,</HI> who died in 1346, and left by her one son, named <HI>Nicholas</HI> Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> the subject of much contest in the court of chivalry with a <HI>Robert de Morley,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CURIOUS TRIAL ABOUT A COAT OF ARMS.<PB N="419" REF="450"/></NOTE>
on account of the arms which <HI>Nicholas</HI> bore, in right of cer∣tain lands of the barony of <HI>Burnel,</HI> bestowed on him by his mother. These arms <HI>de Morley</HI> had assumed without any just pretence; but because, as he declared, <Q>it was his will and pleasure so to do, and that he would defend his so doing.</Q> Probably he had no arms of his own, having been the first of his family who had appeared in a military capacity. He had served as esquire to Sir <HI>Edward Burnel,</HI> without any other domestic than one boy; and ever since the death of his master assumed the arms in dispute. It happened that they both were at the fiege of <HI>Calais,</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> III. in 1346, arrayed in the same arms. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> challenged the arms as belong∣ing to the <HI>Burnels</HI> only, he having at that time under his com∣mand a hundred men, on whose banners were his proper arms. Sir <HI>Peter Corbet,</HI> then in his retinue, offered to combat with <HI>Robert de Morley</HI> in support of the right which his master had to the arms; but the duel never took place, probably because the king denied his assent. The suit was then referred to the court of chivalry, held on the sands before <HI>Calais,</HI> before <HI>Wil∣liam Bohun,</HI> earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> high constable of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Beauchamp,</HI> earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> earl marshal. The trial lasted several days; when <HI>Robert,</HI> apprehending that the cause would go against him, took an opportunity, in presence of the king, to swear by God's flesh, that if the arms in question were adjudged from him, he never more would arm himself in the king's service. On this the king, out of personal regard for the signal services he had performed in those arms, and consi∣dering the right of <HI>Nicholas</HI> Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> was desirous to put an end to the contest with as little offence as possible. He
<PB N="420" REF="451"/>
therefore sent the earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and other lords, to <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to request that he would permit <HI>Robert de Morley</HI> to bear the arms in dispute for the term of his life only; which <HI>Nicholas,</HI> out of respect to the king, assented to. The king then directed the high constable, and earl marshal, to give judgment accor∣dingly. This they performed in the church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> near <HI>Calais;</HI> and their sentence was immediately proclamed by a herald, in the presence of the whole army there assembled.</P>
<P>ROBERT <HI>de Morley</HI> was seized with his last illness in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in the year 1360, when the <HI>English</HI> army was on its return from the blockade of <HI>Paris.</HI> Feeling the approach of death, he di∣rected that his banner, with the arms of <HI>Burnel,</HI> should, upon his decease, be delivered to <HI>Nicholas</HI> Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> in pursuance of the judgment before passed in the court of chivalry; and ac∣cordingly his banner-bearer, having in his hands the banner rolled up, delivered it to Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> in presence of numbers of the nobility, convened as witnesses of the ceremony. Lord <HI>Burnel</HI> died in the year 1382, and was interred in <HI>Acton Burnel</HI> church, under an altar tomb, with a brass inlaid in it of the figure of an armed man, and a brass label, inscribed, <HI>Hic jacet Dominus Nich Burnel, miles, dominus de Holgot, qui ob.</HI> 12<SUP>0</SUP> <HI>die Jan. A.D.</HI> 1382. <HI>Cujus animae propitietur Deus. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the witnesses in this cause were several lords and knights, and many very antient people, some of them above a hundred years of age; one of a hundred and forty, and one of a hundred and twenty, probably of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> as may be collect∣ed from their names, and the testimony they gave relative to the descents of the <HI>Burnels,</HI> and several private affairs of the family,
<PB N="421" REF="452"/>
which were likely to be best known in the neighborhood of their residence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account is from a curious MS. I had the pleasure of receiving from Sir <HI>Edward Smythe.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Longnor</HI> I visited <HI>Caer Caradoc.</HI> After a ride of about three miles, I fell accidentally on the steepest ascent, and, after a laborious clamber up a green and smooth ascent, now and then mixed with small fragments of <HI>lava,</HI> I reached the summit, impeded a little by the first ditch and rampart, in a place where, from the exceeding steepness, they seemed totally unnecessary. A little higher is the second ditch, with a vast agger of stones, now sodded over. The area is irregular, of pretty considerable extent. On the more accessible side are three fosses and ram∣parts. The entrance and approach are very conspicuous, and may even at present be easily travelled on horseback. The area slopes upwards, and ends in a peak.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this place is styled <HI>Caer Caradoc,</HI> it cer∣tainly was not that which was attacked by <HI>Ostorius,</HI> and so ad∣mirably described by <HI>Tacitus.</HI> It agrees only in this part of the description, which is common to most <HI>British</HI> posts, <HI>Hinc monti∣bus arduis, &amp; si qua clementer accedi poterunt modum valli saxa praesiruit;</HI> but it wants the following, <HI>Et prasluebat amnis vada incerto.</HI> The learned editor of <HI>Cambden</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cambden, i. 646, 647, In Rocque's map of Shrcpshire it is called Caer Ca∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> places it at <HI>Gair Ditches,</HI> about three miles south of <HI>Clun,</HI> on the left of the road to <HI>Knighton;</HI> and gives, as I am informed, a faithful description of the trenches and ramparts.

No such river is to be seen near the post I ascended; it therefore could not have been the spot on which our hero was defeated: yet it is highly probable that it had been a post occupied by him, and that it was named from that circumstance. It has from very remote times been tradi∣tionally considered as a strong hold of his; and, within no great number of years, a society of gentlemen, struck with ad∣miration of his virtue, met annually on the hill to celebrate his name in prose or verse. In one year a gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reverend Mr. SNEYD DAVIES.</NOTE>, distinguished as much by his modesty as his great ingenuity, inspired with the subject, almost instantly delivered the most brilliant part of the history of <HI>Caractacus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Taciti Annal lib. xii.</NOTE> in the following lines; which, I flat∣ter myself, will relieve my long-suffering readers after the satiety of my <HI>Welsh</HI> pen, now hung up for ever.</P>

</LIST>
<P>WALES was the refuge to the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> when they were driven by the <HI>Saxons</HI> out of <HI>England;</HI> and there they pre∣served the antient blood royal of their kings, their laws, and antient language, from the fury of the <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>There continued an implacable hatred and wars between the two nations. And though the heptarchy was reduced to a monarchy by <HI>Egbert</HI> king of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> (who first called that part England) yet he and his successors received no obe∣dience or subjection from the kings or princes of <HI>Wales;</HI> but they held <HI>Wales</HI> as absolute monarchs, and acknowledged no su∣perior under God.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Cadwallader</HI> (the last king of <HI>Britain</HI> of the <HI>British</HI> line) and his desendants, did govern the people, as their lawful kings and princes, all the time of the <HI>Saxon</HI> government.</P>
<P>When <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror subdued <HI>England,</HI> he dispos∣sessed the <HI>Saxon</HI> issue of the crown; he rooted out most of their nobility, and brought in his own people, the <HI>Normans:</HI> and when he was in quiet possession of the kingdom, the <HI>Welsh</HI> took no notice of his conquest over the <HI>Saxons;</HI> but accounted of it only as a war between two strange nations.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="460"/>Long before the Conquest, all <HI>Wales</HI> fell to <HI>Roderick</HI> the Great; who divided it between his three sons: to <HI>Cadell</HI> he gave <HI>South Wales,</HI> containing 25 cantreds; to <HI>Anarawd, North Wales,</HI> of 15 cantreds; and to <HI>Mervyn, Powys,</HI> of 14 cantreds.</P>
<P>The issue of these three sons possessed <HI>Wales,</HI> according to the said division, in the Conqueror's time; viz. <HI>Rice,</HI> son of <HI>Theodore,</HI> ruled <HI>South Wales; Griffith ap Conan, North Wales;</HI> and <HI>Blethyn ap Confyn, Powys.</HI> These three princes would ne∣ver acknowledge that the Conqueror had any superiority over <HI>Wales:</HI> and for this reason there arose cruel wars between them, and they made daily incursions on each other.</P>
<P>The kings of <HI>England</HI> often invaded the borders of <HI>Wales,</HI> and forced the inhabitants to fly to the mountains; and the <HI>Welsh,</HI> at other times, made divers inroads over <HI>Severn,</HI> and car∣ried great spoils out of <HI>England.</HI> This so provoked them, that they resolved to make a conquest of <HI>Wales;</HI> but the roughness of the country, the hills, woods, and bogs, was such a pro∣tection, that a great army could hardly be brought to annoy them; but were often forced to return home with lofss. As <HI>William Rufus,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> II. who entered <HI>Wales</HI> three times with royal armies; King <HI>John</HI> made war upon <HI>Llewelin ap for∣werth,</HI> prince of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III. upon <HI>Llewellin ap Griffith,</HI> which brought great loss to themselves, as well as da∣mage to the <HI>Welsh.</HI></P>
<P>The kings of <HI>England,</HI> seeing it difficult to make a conquest of <HI>Wales</HI> by a great army, gave to the lords, and other great men of <HI>England,</HI> such countries in <HI>Wales</HI> as they could win from the <HI>Welshmen.</HI> These are the words of divers of their grants.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="461"/>By these means many were drawn to bring great armies of <HI>Englishmen</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> into <HI>Wales;</HI> who conquered many great lordships; which they held to them and their heirs for ever, of the kings of <HI>England,</HI> as lands purchased by conquest.</P>
<P>The kings of <HI>England</HI> having built divers strong towns of garrison on the frontiers of <HI>Wales,</HI> after the Conquest; such as <HI>Bristow, Gloucester, Worcester, Salop,</HI> and <HI>Chester;</HI> as places ready to chastise the <HI>Welshmen</HI> upon all attempts, the great men began to invade the countries next to those towns; as namely, <HI>Peter Corbet</HI> for <HI>Cause; Mortimer</HI> for <HI>Wigmore; Fitz-alan</HI> for <HI>Clun</HI> and <HI>Oswestry; Walter Lacy</HI> for <HI>Ewyas-Lacy; Dru de Ba∣ladan</HI> for <HI>Abergaveny; Monthault</HI> for <HI>Hawarden; Gilbert</HI> lord of <HI>Monmouth</HI> for <HI>Monmouth; Fulk Fitz-warren</HI> for <HI>Whittington; Roger le Strange</HI> for <HI>Elesmere:</HI> and shortly after came <HI>Robert Fitz-hamon,</HI> with his twelve knights, into <HI>Glamorgan; Bernard Newmarch</HI> into <HI>Brecknock; Strongbow</HI> to <HI>Dyfed</HI> or <HI>Pembrokeshire; Martin</HI> to <HI>Kemes; Morris de Londres</HI> to <HI>Cydwelŷ</HI> and <HI>Cornwallon; Lacy</HI> earl of <HI>Lincoln</HI> to <HI>Rhôs</HI> and <HI>Rhyvoniog,</HI> now the lordship of <HI>Denbigh; Brewis</HI> to <HI>Gower, Buelt, Radnor, Melenith,</HI> and <HI>El∣vel;</HI> and to <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> the country now called <HI>Chirk,</HI> then called <HI>Mochnant,</HI> and to <HI>Cynlleth</HI> and <HI>Nantheudwŷ</HI> and others to other lordships.</P>
<P>That the lords might the better govern the people when subdued, they were suffered to take upon them such preroga∣tive and authority, as were fit for the quiet government of the country.</P>
<P>The antient historiographer, <HI>Lampridius,</HI> saith, that the kings of <HI>England</HI> did then use the same policy with lands on the borders of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="462"/>No record to be found in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> or elsewhere, of any grant to be a lordship marcher in <HI>Wales.</HI> The king's writs, out of the courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> did not run into <HI>Wales,</HI> except <HI>Pembrokeshire;</HI> which was counted part of <HI>England,</HI> and called <HI>Little England</HI> beyond <HI>Wales.</HI> Nor were there any she∣riffs to execute such writs: but the lords did execute laws themselves over the people which they subdued; which the kings permitted for a time.</P>
<P>No charters of these liberties could conveniently be granted, for three reasons.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The kings of <HI>England</HI> did not know beforehand what lands a lord should conquer, or whether he should conquer any; and therefore could not grant any liberties within a certain precinct or territory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The lords, after their conquest of any country, were not over-hasty to purchase any charter; because they were not sure but that those lands might be restored, by composition between the kings of <HI>England</HI> and the princes, of <HI>Wales,</HI> as they some∣times were: or they might be recovered by force, and the lords expelled. But,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The learned say, that the lords marchers had no charters of such liberties, because the liberties were of so high a na∣ture, so royal, and so united to the crown, that, by the law, it was not in the king's power to grant them from the crown.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The government by lords marchers continued in <HI>Wales</HI> till the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII; who, perceiving the <HI>Welsh</HI> to live in quietness and subjection, thought they might be governed by civil laws, as the <HI>English</HI> were. And therefore, anno 27, c. 24, he resumed most of those jurisdictions into his own hands, and
<PB N="434" REF="463"/>
appointed justices of peace, sheriffs, and other officers; and di∣vided the country into shires. He governed them by the laws of <HI>England;</HI> and left little or no authority to the lords marchers.</P>
<P>The lords, at their, conquest of the country, built castles for themselves, and towns for their followers, in the most fertile part: and by this means the towns and castles in <HI>Wales</HI> were built, as may be seen in the antient charters of those towns.</P>
<P><HI>Pembroke, Tenby,</HI> and <HI>Haverfordwest,</HI> by <HI>Strongbow; William de Valence,</HI> and the <HI>Hastings,</HI> being his posterity: <HI>Newport,</HI> by <HI>Martin</HI> lord of <HI>Kemes: Cydwely,</HI> by <HI>Londres;</HI> and augmented afterwards by the duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> to whom it came by mar∣riage.</P>
<P><HI>Swansey, Oystermouth, Loghor, Radnor, Buelt, Raiadr,</HI> and others, by the <HI>Brewises;</HI> from whom they came to the <HI>Morti∣mers</HI> and <HI>Beauchamps,</HI> by a female issue of <HI>Brewis: Brecknock,</HI> by <HI>Bernard Newmarch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Blaen-Llyfney,</HI> by <HI>Herbert: Caerdiff</HI> and <HI>Cowbridge,</HI> by <HI>Fitz∣hamon,</HI> and the earls of <HI>Gloucester: Neath,</HI> by <HI>Greenfield: Aber∣gaveny,</HI> by <HI>Dru de Baladan, Miles</HI> earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and others, his posterity: <HI>Ruthin,</HI> by Lord Grey: <HI>Denbigh,</HI> by <HI>Lacy</HI> earl of <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>Some of these were towns before the Conquest; but, being destroyed in the winning of them, they were rebuilt by the lords.</P>
<P>The lords held their lordships of the kings of <HI>England</HI> in chief, as of the crown immediate, by serving the king in his wars with certain numbers of men; and they were bound to keep their castles with sufficient men and munition, for the keeping of the king's enemies in subjection.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="464"/>They executed the <HI>English</HI> laws, for the most part, within their lordships; and brought them to be of <HI>English</HI> tenure; and to pass the same according to the laws of <HI>England,</HI> by fine, recovery, feoffment, and livery of seisin. But such parts as they left to the antient inhabitants to possess, were by some lords suffered to be held after the old <HI>Welsh</HI> custom, the laws of <HI>Howel Dda;</HI> which was, to pass the same by surrender in court (which they called <HI>Côf Lŷs,</HI> and <HI>Ystŷn Wialen,</HI> whereof the word <HI>Ystynnol</HI> was derived): and where that custom was permitted, there is no deed to be found of any lands before the 27th <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. when <HI>Wales</HI> was made shire-ground; but, for such lands as were turned to <HI>English</HI> tenures, you may find deeds of two, three, or four hundred years past, written in <HI>Latin,</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> as was used in <HI>England</HI> in those days.</P>
<P>The laws of <HI>England</HI> were brought in by the lords marchers, because the laws of the land were unknown to the <HI>English:</HI> but they suffered the antient tenants to retain some part of the old <HI>Welsh</HI> laws; such as the use of gavelkind, for parting lands between the brothers, and the passing of lands by surrender in court. And for this, in many lordships, there is a <HI>Welsh</HI> court for the <HI>Welshmen,</HI> called <HI>Welchrie;</HI> and another for the <HI>English,</HI> called <HI>Englishrie.</HI> In some lordships the lands were divided by gavelkind, but passed by feoffments; from whence comes <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> tenure, and <HI>Welsh</HI> dole: in <HI>Welsh, Cyfraith Saesnig, a Rhan-Cymraig.</HI> And the lords had the wardship of all the brethren, as if they had been sisters.</P>
<P>The lords marchers increased in number, till <HI>Llewellin ap Griffith,</HI> the last prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> was slain, anno 11 <HI>Ed.</HI> I; who then took the principality of <HI>Wales</HI> into his hands, and
<PB N="436" REF="465"/>
gave it to <HI>Edward</HI> II. his son, and made him prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> Since which time no more lordships marchers could be erected; for the <HI>Welsh</HI> in general submitted themselves to the kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Since the principality came to the kings of <HI>England,</HI> no lord marcher could claim any liberty or prerogative, more than they had before, without a grant.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> I. immediately held a parliament at <HI>Ruthlan</HI> castle; and there ordained laws and officers, to govern <HI>Wales</HI> after the <HI>English</HI> manner.</P>
<P>The lordship of <HI>Powŷs</HI> had not its original from conquest:, as the lordships marchers had; but in this manner:</P>
<P><HI>Griffith,</HI> son of <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> lord of <HI>Powŷs,</HI> seeing the king of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> lords, preparing themselves to conquer <HI>Wales,</HI> did, in discretion and policy, submit himself to <HI>Henry</HI> I. and yielded to hold his lordship of the king of <HI>England</HI> in chief, as the lords marchers did, and to do the king the like service; and thereupon was suffered to hold the same to him and his heirs; and was created lord <HI>Powŷs</HI> by the said <HI>Henry</HI> I. and made baron of the parliament of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>His descendant, <HI>Hawŷs Gadarn,</HI> fell to be the king of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>'s ward, by reason of the alteration of the tenure in capite; who gave her in marriage to a valiant gentleman of his, named <HI>John Charlton.</HI> And so the lordship of <HI>Powŷs</HI> came to the pos∣session of the <HI>English</HI> lords. (<HI>Mowthwy,</HI> and others, did the same). These (with the lords marchers) held their lordships of the kings in chief, and not of the princes of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>The lord of <HI>Powŷs</HI> thus submitting himself to the king of <HI>England,</HI> the comots in that lordship continue whole and entire
<PB N="437" REF="466"/>
to this day; and there is a court baron in every one of them, But the lords marchers, to reward those that assisted them in their conquests, gave them divers manors; and so divided the comots into several parts, and erected a court-baron in each. The comots were six; <HI>Carcinion, Mechan uwch-Coed, Mechan is-Coed, Mochnant, Llannerch-hûdol,</HI> and <HI>Ystrad-marchell.</HI></P>
<P>The like may be found in the counties of <HI>Anglesey, Caernar∣von, Merioneth, Flint, Carmarthen,</HI> and <HI>Cardigan;</HI> where the antient comots remain entire, without alteration; and retain their antient names and bounds, and keep the same courts. The reason is, because they were not conquered by the lords marchers, but continued in the hands of the princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> till <HI>Llewellin,</HI> the last prince, was slain by <HI>Edward</HI> I.</P>
<P>It appears by antient record, that the lordship of <HI>Bromefield</HI> and <HI>Yale,</HI> antiently called <HI>Dinas Brân,</HI> being the chief castle of the lordship, came to the possession of <HI>English</HI> lords, as fol∣lows:</P>
<P><HI>Emma,</HI> daughter to Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> and widow to <HI>Griffith ap Ma∣dog,</HI> lord of <HI>Bromefield</HI> and <HI>Yale, Chirk, Nantheudwŷ, Maelor,</HI> and other lands, parcel of antient <HI>Powŷs</HI> having four sons, be∣tween whom their father's inheritance was divided; strife grew between her and her husband's kindred about the custody of her sons: they fearing, that if the sons should be brought up by the mother in <HI>England,</HI> they would become <HI>English;</HI> and rather incline to the king of <HI>England,</HI> than to the princes of <HI>Wales.</HI> But the mother getting into her possession the two eldest, <HI>Ma∣dog</HI> and <HI>Llewellin;</HI> the first having to his part <HI>Bromefield</HI> and <HI>Yale,</HI> and the other, <HI>Chirk</HI> and <HI>Nantheubwŷ;</HI> and not being
<PB N="438" REF="467"/>
able to keep them to herself, nor to remain in quiet upon her jointure, she delivered her sons to <HI>Edward</HI> I. shewing that by right they were his wards, because their ancestors had formerly made their submission to the kings of <HI>England.</HI> The king took them to his ward; and committed <HI>Madog,</HI> the eldest, to the care of <HI>John</HI> earl <HI>Warren;</HI> and <HI>Llewellin</HI> to <HI>Roger Mortimer,</HI> third son to <HI>Ralph</HI> Lord <HI>Mortimer,</HI> of <HI>Wigmore.</HI> The two guardians having the sons and their lands in their custody, Earl <HI>Warren</HI> built the castle of <HI>Holt</HI> in <HI>Bromefield,</HI> and <HI>Roger Morti∣mer</HI> the castle of <HI>Chirk,</HI> and placed garrisons of <HI>English</HI> in each, to defend the country from the <HI>Welsh.</HI> And the wards dying shortly after, without issue, the said guardians still kept the lands, and obtained grants of the king to hold the same, 10th of <HI>Edward</HI> I; only the castle of <HI>Hope,</HI> and lands thereto belonging, were reserved to the king in Earl <HI>Warren</HI>'s grant. The antient rent of <HI>Bromefield</HI> and <HI>Yale,</HI> was 730<HI>l.</HI> a year.</P>
<P><HI>Emma</HI> being molested in her jointure, because she had de∣livered her sons to the king, and so procured the coming of those lords to build the castles of <HI>Bromefield</HI> and <HI>Chirk,</HI> she de∣sired the king to take <HI>Maelor,</HI> her jointure, and to give her lands in <HI>England</HI> for it; which the king did, and so got into, possession of <HI>Maelor Saesnaeg,</HI> and held the same ever after; not suffering any of the heirs to have it, pretending that they were rebels against him.</P>
<P>No lord marcher without a castle, and a sufficient garrison to suppress such of the <HI>Welsh</HI> as should annoy the king's subjects; and therefore all castles had towns close to them, inhabited by the <HI>English.</HI> And, by 4 <HI>Henry</HI> IV. c. 32, it is enacted, that
<PB N="439" REF="468"/>
castles and walled towns in <HI>Wales</HI> should be possessed by valiant <HI>Englishmen,</HI> strangers to the seigniories.</P>
<P>The charters of those towns give great liberty to the <HI>English;</HI> but no <HI>Welshman</HI> might be a burgess, or purchase any land therein; see 2 <HI>Henry</HI> IV. c. 12. and 20. It was also enacted, that no <HI>Welshman</HI> should have any castle or fortress, saving such as was in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. except bishops and temporal lords.</P>
<P>The more to encourage the <HI>English</HI> to conquer <HI>Wales</HI> the kings of <HI>England</HI> created them peers of the realm, by the name of lords baron of the places they conquered. Their number once was twenty-one; but now are reduced to one, <HI>viz. Aber∣gaveny,</HI> who is the first lord baron of <HI>England.</HI> The rest lost their name and place, by coming either to the crown, or to lords who had other places and titles in parliament. The castles in <HI>Wales</HI> were about 143.</P>
<P>The <HI>Welsh</HI> submitted to <HI>Henry</HI> VII. because he was paternally descended from their princes: and his son, <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. made several statutes for the future government of them, anno 27.</P>
<P>Lords marchers seized on the goods of their tenants, who died intestate.</P>
<P>All the lordships marchers have lost their antient jurisdictions and authorities, which were the common signs whereby they were known; so that it is now a doubt which were such lord∣ships. But they may still be known by several tokens.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There can be no lordship marcher but such as was sub∣dued before the death of Prince <HI>Llewellin.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Such lordship must be held of the king in chief, and not of the principality of <HI>Wales.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="440" REF="469"/>
3. It must have been in antient time the inheritance of some <HI>English</HI> lord.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If any suit arose about the title, it was to be pleaded at common law, in <HI>Westminster-Hall;</HI> and there were fines levied of those lordships, and none other in <HI>Wales.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The escheator of the marches of <HI>Wales</HI> did in antient time inquire of the tenure, and find <HI>office post mortem</HI> of the lord; and that by writ out of the chancery of <HI>England.</HI> And as those lordships were not in any shire in <HI>England,</HI> and the king had no escheators to enquire of the tenure of them, the same was laid on the escheator of the next <HI>English</HI> shire. And such es∣cheators had the charge, care, and survey of all lordships marches that were holden of the king. And such escheator was to go into any lordship marcher in <HI>Wales,</HI> and swear an in∣quest, and find an office after the death of the lord, and inquire of the tenure and value of the lordship.—N. B. All offices of other manors, that were holden of the king, as of his princi∣pality, were found, by virtue of writs out of the king's ex∣chequer, of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> or <HI>Chester,</HI> for <HI>North Wales;</HI> and <HI>Car∣marthen,</HI> or <HI>Cardigan,</HI> for <HI>South Wales;</HI> and out of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> for lands in that earldom.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. These lords, by stat. 24 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. c. 9, have the penalty for killing of wainlings, and for non-appearance at their courts; and, by stat. 26 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. c. 4, and 27, c. 26, they have the forfeiture of common mainprize, recognizances, mizes; power to keep court-barons and court-leets; and to have waifs, strays, infangthefe, outfangthefe, treasure-trove, deodands, goods and chattels of felons, persons condemned, and outlawed: and also wreck de mere, wharfage, and custom of strangers.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="441" REF="470"/>From the river <HI>Tifi,</HI> in <HI>South Wales,</HI> to the river <HI>Conwy,</HI> in <HI>North Wales,</HI> there was no lordship marcher; but all that coun∣try remained wholly to the princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> until the princi∣pality came to the crown by Prince <HI>Llewellin</HI>'s death.</P>
<P>As the river <HI>Severn</HI> was the antient limit between <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> a doubt hath arisen, why all the land that is over that river, <HI>viz.</HI> all <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> and so much as is part of <HI>Gloucester∣shire, Worcestershire,</HI> and <HI>Shropshire,</HI> had not been lordships marchers, as the rest of <HI>Wales</HI> was, that was won since the Con∣quest.</P>
<P>The reason is this: All <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> and those parts of the other counties, were won from the <HI>Welsh</HI> in, or shortly after, the time of <HI>Offa</HI> king of <HI>Mercia.</HI> The <HI>Welsh</HI> were expelled thence, the country was new planted with <HI>Englishmen;</HI> and this was long before the dividing of <HI>England</HI> into shires. The same was an∣nexed to the kingdom of <HI>Mercia;</HI> and so, as part of that king∣dom, it came to the hands of king <HI>Alfred,</HI> who first divided <HI>Eng∣land</HI> into shires. He finding those countries subdued, and the <HI>Welsh</HI> expelled, divided them with the rest on the other side <HI>Se∣vern.</HI> He added part to <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> part to <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> and part to <HI>Shropshire;</HI> and made <HI>Herefordshire</HI> a shire of itself.</P>
<P>Here lies the difference between conquering of <HI>Wales</HI> by the <HI>Saxons</HI> and the <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<P>So much of <HI>Wales</HI> as the <HI>Saxon</HI> kings won, they did it at their own charge, and for their own use; and did not suffer their subjects to deal therein. But the <HI>Norman</HI> conqueror, content∣ing himself with the realm of <HI>England,</HI> did not bend his forces against <HI>Wales</HI> more than he was forced to do, by their invading of his people and country; and he, and his successors, thought
<PB N="442" REF="471"/>
it better policy to give to the nobility such parts of <HI>Wales</HI> as they could conquer.</P>
<P><HI>Herefordshire</HI> was not won since the Conquest, appears from the lordship of <HI>Urchinfield;</HI> which is antient demesne-lands; such as is not to be found in <HI>England,</HI> but what was in the pos∣session of its kings before the Conquest. See <HI>Silas Taylor,</HI> of <HI>Urchinfield,</HI> in his History of Gavelkind, p. 106: and <HI>Humphrey Lhwyd,</HI> in his Fragment of the Description of <HI>Wales;</HI> his <HI>Latin</HI> book, p. 52, first edition; <HI>English</HI> translation, p. 63: whose words, as <HI>Bryan Twyne</HI> translates, are, <HI>Gwŷr Reunwe</HI> makes one of the six states, that met at the mouth of the river <HI>Dyvi,</HI> to chuse <HI>Maelgwyn Gwynedd</HI> king, about the year 560. P. 74, of his Breviary of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from thence, viz. <HI>Lamstre,</HI> or <HI>Llanlieni,</HI> is the antient city <HI>Henfford,</HI> standing upon <HI>Wye,</HI> or more truly <HI>Gŵy;</HI> in old time called <HI>Ferleg,</HI> now <HI>Hereford.</HI></P>
<P>Towards <HI>Severn</HI> are <HI>Malvern</HI> hills; and in the corner between <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Wye,</HI> not far from the town of <HI>Ross,</HI> is that renowned wood, which, from the <HI>Danes,</HI> is called the forest of <HI>Dean.</HI></P>
<P>These regions, with all <HI>Herefordshire</HI> beyond <HI>Wye,</HI> before they were possessed by the <HI>English,</HI> were termed, in <HI>British, Euryenwe;</HI> and the inhabitants, <HI>Eurnwŷr:</HI> of which there remains some∣what in the word <HI>Urchinfield.</HI> The <HI>Welsh</HI> called it <HI>Ergnig,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Ergenel;</HI> and no marvel, since the lest portion thereof retains now the name of <HI>Powys.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>Letter from the <HI>Bourbonoisse</HI> to his Father, dated 1st <HI>April,</HI> 1614, giving an Account of the Discontents in <HI>France</HI> in the begin∣ning of the Reign of <HI>Louis</HI> XIII.</HEAD>
<P>MY humble duty premised—Our embassador being return∣ed to <HI>England,</HI> and my acquaintance in <HI>Paris</HI> retyred with him; I am uncertayn where to dyrect my lr̄es, that I may be assured they may come to hand.</P>
<P>This state of <HI>France</HI> is in division with ytselfe; for certain of the princes are discontentedly retyred to their governments; where they fortify themselves in the strongest cytties. Those
<PB N="459" REF="488"/>
of them who want place of importance in their own countrey, joyn with the rest to make good the hould they fynd fitt to make resistance: and so many are joyned togeather in <HI>Champaigne,</HI> being the government of the duke of <HI>Nevers,</HI> who also is one of the number. But the cheife of all is the prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> with whom also is the duke of <HI>Vendosme,</HI> bastard son to the late king of <HI>France;</HI> who not longe since was comitted to pryson; but finding that opportunite to shift him self into the habit of a scullion, he escaped, and put himselfe into the companie of, the malecontents, being in number about six or 7 dukes, besides others, assembled togeather, upon there garde, in the cytty of <HI>Misiers</HI> and <HI>Cedan,</HI> upon the borders of the Low Coun∣treys, being frontyre towns of <HI>Champaign.</HI> Whence the prince of <HI>Conde</HI> writt to the king and queen, shewing the cause of his retyrednes, so far as touched himselfe, being, as he sayed, out of the care he had of the king and kingdome, to reform the one, and give contentment to the other; which could not be don without the assembly of the states, which he earnestly desi∣red, principally to abridge the extream taxations of the sub∣jects; to purge the kingdome of the unnecessarie offices, who served to no other use than to impoverish the people; and with∣all to forbear to proceed in the marriadge between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spayn,</HI> untyll the assembly of the estates wear dissolved, least any thinge should be concluded to the pjudice of those of the reformed religion. The lre was well written, and carried with yt a shewe of great good to the comon wealth; but the people are so fearfull of the name of civil warre, that very fewe stirr of the parte of the princes. It is very true that the prince of <HI>Conde</HI> was drawn into the number by some other of the dukes,
<PB N="460" REF="489"/>
and not out of any just cause that he hath of discontent, more then for the love of some of them who he wo<SUP>d</SUP> protect.</P>
<P>Thèr ys watch and ward in all towns, and good order for provision of arms, whereof ther ys no want in these partes.</P>
<P>The queen maketh great preparation to go to meete the king of <HI>Spayn,</HI> to conclude the marriage, notwithstandinge the dis∣taste the princes have of that proceedinge.</P>
<P>The report hear ys, that the princes will submit themselves to the kings mercie, and will offer themselves to attende the kinge to his marriage; but how that will prove, ys uncertain: for they fortifie themselves daylie; and, while they speake of peace, they prepare for warre. But that w<SUP>ch</SUP> will turn to there mischife ys the want of money, w<SUP>ch</SUP> all knowe; otherwise they are well seated to do the kinge a shrewd turne. These sturrs in <HI>France</HI> causeth the kingdome to be more difficult for tra∣vaile, and maketh many strangers remove to other countreys; myself amonge the rest am resolved of my remove, with as much speed as I may, to <HI>Savoy,</HI> and so to <HI>Piēmont,</HI> and to see some part of <HI>Lombardie,</HI> before the extreamitie of the heate. I have continued here in <HI>Burbonnoise</HI> to exercise myself to ride, where∣to I have applyed myselfe amonge the best-natured people of the world.

<P>SYTHENCE The writinge Of my last, I removed from the place where I was to <HI>Lyons,</HI> being 30 leagues Of <HI>Burbonnoise.</HI> Before I set foorth, I ridd to the Bath, w<SUP>ch</SUP> ys 5 leagues distant from <HI>Moulins,</HI> as well to see the castle as other remarkable things, w<SUP>ch</SUP> are well worthy a strangers Observion. The go∣vernor Of The country sent expressly to cause all things to be shewed me. Being arrived, I bestowed that nyht to see the new work, w<SUP>ch</SUP> the last king caused to be built near the springe; but that w<SUP>ch</SUP> was wonderfull, was 3 inclosed places within the bath, the waters whereof ys so extream hot, that there ys not any that care adventure to goe bath himselfe within, though the weather be never so could: for experience whereof, the last great frost, a younge mayd goinge to take up water, her feet slipt, because of the yce, and falling into the water, was taken up dead, being boyled by reason Of the extroardinarie heat of the springe. The next morninge I sawe the castle Of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> w<SUP>ch</SUP> ys extroardinarie well seated for strength, and adorned with∣in with a very fayr chappell, beinge on of the rarest pieces Of worke Of <HI>France;</HI> within w<SUP>ch</SUP> there ys a piece of the very true crosse of our Saviour (if wee may give credit to them that have the keepinge thereof) w<SUP>ch</SUP> was brought from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> By St. <HI>Clovis,</HI> king Of <HI>France,</HI> with on of the thorns of the crown Of our Saviour, w<SUP>ch</SUP> marvilouslie doth flowr upon the Passion day, between nine and ten of the clock; and after 10 doth vanish away. I wo<SUP>d</SUP> upon that day have gone to see yt, but I found
<PB N="462" REF="491"/>
all men at there devotion; so that non wo<SUP>d</SUP> travaile that day. I doubt nothinge of the omnipotencie of the Almightie, who hath made all things of nothinge; but I make question of ma∣ny superstitious observations of these Papists, who have often belyed God, attributinge to reliks more then to God. This thorn is inclosed in christall within the same that the crosse ys, beinge all set in gould, with works of imagerie, contayninge the passion of our Saviour; w<SUP>ch</SUP> the houldinge in your hand, the bud appeareth at that tyme of the day, upon Good Fryday, remayneth on flowr, and so vanisheth.</P>
<P>From thence to <HI>Lyons,</HI> where I contynued a week; and so by water I voyaged to <HI>Avignon,</HI> w<SUP>ch</SUP> ys belonging to the Pope: where entring into the town, I was demanded by the gard at the gate, whence I was, and of what religion? Where havinge related all things, according to there demand, I was lett passe towarde my lodginge, beinge somewhat melancholick, because I supposed that I sho<SUP>d</SUP> not have that libertie to see all places in that towne, as I desired; but havinge encountred with a <HI>French</HI> lord of that country, of whom I inquired whether I might freely see all places in town; who used me with that extroar∣dinarie kindness, that being invited to supper that night, he speake of me to the cardinal, being vice-legat; and the next morninge brought me to the cardinal, who was returned from masse;, having a hundred gentlemen well appointed, who in ranke went before him, by three and by three, until the pallaisie; my selfe coming by with that lord, I was saluted by the legat, and honorably entertayned with many good words, tellinge me that yt was not lawfull for those of our religion to remayne above, three dayes; but for me, I might stay as longe as I wo<SUP>d</SUP>—
<PB N="463" REF="492"/>
with many other circumstances of love and curtesie; enjoyninge that I<SUP>d</SUP> to shewe me all places in town, and principally to con∣duct me to see a companie at a gentlemans house, who wear ready to maske and dance, in honour of a babtisme, whereunto the cardinals brother was intreated as godfather. In ende, be∣inge after dinner at the church, to see the manner of yt, though I had before seen the like, behould a great number of violens and musitiens came marching before the godfather, who brought the child upon his arme (accordinge to the <HI>French</HI> manner) to the church; and then the ladies and gentlewomen accompany∣inge the godmother entred, and so they went to the ceremonie; my selfe went amonge the rest, and stood by to hear and see what they did: which some gentlemen perceivinge, who had taken notice of me in the morninge, demanded of me how I liked of the ceremonie? I sayd well. And whether there wear great difference between the <HI>English</HI> manner and that of <HI>France</HI> for the babtisme? I answered, for that I had seen that they differed from us. I was further pressed by those gent, whether yt pleased me to see the manner of yt or not? I sayd yea; but that I co<SUP>d</SUP> not enter for the presse. Then the gent made me place, and brought me close to the place; where, in interpretinge unto me the manner of all circumstances, he was louder than the curit who babtized the child. When all was done, the godfather kissed the godmother openlie in the church. The companie, being many that came about me, seeing I was a stranger, to hear what the other gent and I discoursed of. I was asked by the parent of the child, in what sort we differed in <HI>England</HI> from the manner of <HI>France</HI> in babtisme? I answered, that our children wear not so well fed, before they received babtisme,
<PB N="464" REF="493"/>
as this child was. The gent fell all to a laughter; for indeed the child was so ould that he was almost ready to goe, and had such a broad face, that all the companie were made merry with the mouths the child made at the preist, duringe the time he was using his office. The gent tould me that yt was the man∣ner in these countreys also to christen them when they wear 4 or 5 dayes ould; but for this, the godfather beinge in <HI>Italy,</HI> they wear constrained to stay till his return. After the babtisme I was offered all the curtesie that I could desire. And so I went to <HI>Aix,</HI> being the parliment of <HI>Provence,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Marselles,</HI> where I now am. From hence to <HI>Nezi,</HI> beinge the duke of <HI>Savoys</HI> countrey; and from thence to <HI>Genua;</HI> and thence to <HI>Lucca;</HI> and so to <HI>Florence,</HI> w<SUP>ch</SUP> ys 500 miles hence: where I shall not have so much money as will conduct me fur∣ther, but only what will maintayn me untill I receive money from <HI>England,</HI> which I humbly entreat you to use means to send me my <HI>Michaelmas</HI> rent. Have patience with me, if I con∣tinewe a little longer then you wo<SUP>d</SUP>; I do yt for my experience, w<SUP>ch</SUP> I wo<SUP>d</SUP> gayne, if I may, as well as others; but without tyme, a man can do but what he can. I hope you would not that I should be less sufficient then other gent, who seeke out ther experience by the same means that I doe. I hope that yt shall not repent you anythinge of the course I have taken, no more then yt doth me. God send you your health, and my mother hers; and make both of you partakers of my prayers!</P>

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> X. ACCOUNT OF SIR RICHARD BULKELEY; IN WHICH IS A STRONG DESCRIPTION OF THE TYRANNY OF THE FAVORITE EARL OF LEICESTER.</HEAD>
<P>SIR <HI>Rich<SUP>d</SUP> Bulkeley</HI> served in parl<SUP>t</SUP> for the county of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> the 2<SUP>d</SUP> and 3<SUP>d</SUP> sessions of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> the 3<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>Eliz.</HI> and 1<SUP>st</SUP> of <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>He was of goodly person, fair of complexion, and tall of sta∣ture. He was temperate in his dyet, not drinking of healths. In his habit, he never changed his fashion; but always wore round breeches, and thick bumbast doublets, though very gallant and
<PB N="467" REF="496"/>
rich. In the last year of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> being then somewhat stricken in years, he attended the counsil of marches at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> in winter-time. When the lord president <HI>Zouch</HI> went in his coach to church, or elsewhere, Sir <HI>Richard</HI> used to ride on a great stone horse; and some time he wo<SUP>d</SUP> go from his lodging to church, in frost and snow, on foot, with a short cloak, silk stockings, a great rapier and dagger, tarry all prayers and ser∣mon in very cold weather; insomuch y<SUP>r</SUP> L<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>Zouch</HI> was wont to say, he was cold to see him.</P>
<P>He was a great reader of history, and discourses of all estates and countries; of very good memory; and understanding in matters belonging to housekeeping, husbandry, maritime af∣fayres, building of ships, and maintaining them at sea. He drew his own letters, and answered all letters with his own hand: and being complayned of at the counsil of the marches for breach of an order of that court, he drew his own answer— that he co<SUP>d</SUP> not be evicted out of his possession but by course of common law—pleaded <HI>Magna Charta</HI>—and demanded judge∣ment: which answer being put into court, the chief justice, Sir <HI>Richard Shuttleworth,</HI> called for a sight thereof; and after pe∣rusal, said to the counsellors at the bar, <Q>Look, my masters, what a bone S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Rich<SUP>d</SUP> Bulkeley</HI> hath cast into the court, for you to tire upon:</Q> and the matter being argued, it was, re∣ferred to the com̄on law.</P>
<P>He was a great housekeeper, and entertainer of strangers, especially such as passed to or from <HI>Ireland.</HI> He nobly enter∣tained the earl of <HI>Essex</HI> in his way there, to be lord lieuten<SUP>t</SUP>. He made provision of all necessaries for his table beforehand. He sent yearly two ships to <HI>Greenland</HI> for cod, ling, and other
<PB N="468" REF="497"/>
fish; which he did use to barter in <HI>Spain</HI> for <HI>Malaga</HI> and sherrie wines; and always kept a good stocke of old sack in his cellar, which he called <HI>Amabile,</HI> besides other wines. He kept two parks well stored with Red and Fallow Deer; w<SUP>ch</SUP> did afford such plenty of venison, as furnished his table 3 or 4 times every week in the season, besides pleasuring of friends. He kept several farms, besides his demesne, in his hands, w<SUP>ch</SUP> fur∣nished his house with fat beef, mutton, lamb, &amp;c. &amp;c. He was an excellent horseman, and an expert tilter; keeping two great stables of horses, one in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and another in <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> and a great studd of mares. His estate in <HI>Anglesey</HI> was £. 2500, in <HI>Carnarvonshire</HI> £. 800, and in <HI>Cheshire</HI> £. 1000, a year: having always a great stock of ready money lying in his chest. He kept many servants and attendants, tall and proper men: two lacqueys in livery always ran by his horse: he never went from home without 20 or 24 to attend him. He was a great favo∣rite of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> He had powerful freinds at court, and had the gentry and commonalty of the county of <HI>Anglesey</HI> at his ser∣vice, except the <HI>Woods</HI> of <HI>Rhosmore,</HI> who were always his ennemies.</P>
<P>He had great contests with <HI>Dudley</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester;</HI> who ob∣tayned the queens letters patents under the great seal, to be chief ranger of the forrest of <HI>Snowdon:</HI> in which office he be∣haved very injuriously to the counties of <HI>Merioneth, Carnarvon,</HI> and <HI>Anglesey;</HI> attempting to bring within the bounds and li∣mits of that forrest most of the freeholders lands in those 3 counties; and for that purpose the earl procured several com∣missions from the queen to inquire of encroachments and con∣cealments of lands. The return of the jury, in <HI>Anglesey,</HI> not
<PB N="469" REF="498"/>
being agreeable to the earls commissioners, they went in a rage to <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> forcibly entered the exchequer there, ran∣sacked the records, and carried away what they pleased; but the earl, after making many attempts, to the great grievance of the country, was obliged to desist, being defeated in all schemes upon <HI>Snowdon,</HI> by the power and interest and spirit of Sir <HI>Rich<SUP>d</SUP> Bulkeley.</HI> But, <HI>manet alta mente repostum,</HI> the earl bore a poy∣sonous hatred to Sir <HI>Rich<SUP>d</SUP>;</HI> yet he continued still in favor with the queen and counsel, though often molested by the earl, his agents and creatures.</P>
<P>S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard</HI> being one of the deputy lewtenants of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> (upon intelligence of the <HI>Spanish Armadas</HI> threatening <HI>England</HI>) was to cesse the country in arms; and cessing Mr. <HI>Woods</HI> of <HI>Rhosmore,</HI> he was highly offended, and thought himself too heavi∣ly loaden: therefore went up to court to the earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> carrying a false tale with him, that Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley</HI> (a little before the attainder and execution of <HI>Tho<SUP>s</SUP> Salusbury,</HI> one of the accomplices of <HI>Anth<SUP>y</SUP> Babington,</HI> the traytor, 1585) had been in the mountains of <HI>Snowdon</HI> conferring with him, and that at a farm of Sir <HI>Richards,</HI> called <HI>Cwmligie,</HI> they had layne together two or 3 nights. The earl, glad of this information, presently acquaints the queen and council therewith. Sir <HI>Richard</HI> being called before the council, and examined, absolutely denied the whole matter. And when the earl, at y<SUP>t</SUP> time president of the queens counsil, did severely inforce it ag<SUP>t</SUP> him, he told the earl to his face, "Your father, and the very same men as now informe against me, were like to undoe my father; for, upon the death of K. <HI>Edw.</HI> 6, by letters from your father, he was commanded to proclayme Queen <HI>Jane,</HI> and to muster the
<PB N="470" REF="499"/>
country; which he did accordingly: and had not my mother been one of Queen <HI>Maries</HI> maids of honor, he had come to great trouble and danger." Hearing these words, the counsil hushed, and rose; and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> departed. The earl hastened to the queen, and told her the counsil had been examining Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley</HI> about matters of treason; that they found him a dangerous person, and saw cause to comit him to the Tower; and that he dwellt in a suspicious corner of the world. "What! Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley!"</HI> said the queen; "he never intended us any harm. We have brought him up from a boy, and have had special tryal of his fidelity: you shall not comit him." "We," said the earl, "have the care of your majestys person, see more and hear more of the man than you doe: he is of an aspiring mind, and lives in a remote place." "Before God (replyed the queen) we will be sworn upon the holy Evan∣gelists, he never intended us any harm;" and so ran to the Bible and kissed it, saying, "You shall not comitt him: we have brought him up from a boy." Then the lords of the counsill wrote a letter to D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hugh Bellot,</HI> lord bishop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> to exa∣mine the truth of the accusation layd to Sir <HI>Richards</HI> charge: which the bishop found false and forged; and so certifyed to the counsil. Whereupon he was cleared, to the queens majestys great content, to the abundant joy of his country, and to his own great credit and reputation: and afterwards diverse of the lords of the councell wrote letters to the justices of assize of <HI>North Wales,</HI> to publish Sir <HI>Richards</HI> wrongs, and to notify to the queens subjects his clear innocence.</P>
<P>But that Sir <HI>Richard</HI> might not rest in peace, one <HI>Green,</HI> be∣longing to the earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> in the name of one <HI>Bromfeild,</HI>
<PB N="471" REF="500"/>
a pensioner, came to him, to challenge him to meet <HI>Bromfeild</HI> in the feild. "Have you no other errand (quoth Sir <HI>Richard?</HI>)" "No," says <HI>Green.</HI> Then S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard</HI> drew his dagger, and broke <HI>Greens</HI> pate, telling him to carry that as his answer; he scorning to meet such a knave as <HI>Bromfeild.</HI> This treatment of <HI>Green</HI> highly encreased the anger of the Earl. <HI>Bromfeild, Green,</HI> and others of his retayners, plotted mischief to the per∣son of Sir <HI>Richard;</HI> but he stood upon his guard, keeping al∣ways 24 stout men, with swords, bucklers, and daggers, to de∣fend him from their attempts. They hired boats and wherries upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> with a design to drown Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> as he sho<SUP>d</SUP> go from <HI>Westminster</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> but he, being privately informed thereof, borrowed the lord mayor of <HI>Londons</HI> barge, furnished it with men, musquetts, billets, drums, and trumpets, and rowed along the <HI>Thames,</HI> shot the bridge, and went down to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where the queen kept her court at that time; and at the landing place, over against the pallace, he caused his companie to discharge their musquets, to beat their drums, and sound their trumpets. The earl of <HI>Leycester</HI> hearing there∣of, repaired to the queen, and informed her that Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley,</HI> more like a rebel than a subject, had come with barges, men, musquetts, drums, and trumpets; and had shot several pieces over against her majestys palace, to the great terror of her court; a matter not be suffered. The queen sent for Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> and, after hearing his apology for himself, made the earl freinds with him. Within a while after, the earl sent for S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard</HI> to his chamber; who coming thither, the earl began to expostulate with him on several wrongs and abuses he pretended to have received at his hands; and that
<PB N="472" REF="501"/>
he had lost £. 10,000 by his opposition. But the discourse end∣ed in milder terms, and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> was bidden to dinner; but did eat or drink nothing, save of what he saw the earl tast, re∣membring Sir <HI>Nic<SUP>s</SUP> Throgmorton,</HI> who was said to have received a fig at his table.</P>
<P>But the earl of <HI>Lycester</HI> dying in <HI>Oct<SUP>r</SUP></HI> 1588, Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley,</HI> and his country, enjoyed peace and quietness from his tyrannical oppressions, his devices and wicked practises: and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> survived to the 28 <HI>June</HI> 1621, when he dyed, aged 88. He had attended the coronation of y<SUP>e</SUP> queens <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and of <HI>James</HI> the 1st. His cloak, at this last coro∣nation, cost him £ .500.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Wor.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE concurrence of wisdom and affection, in your last ac∣tion of intending the remove of your son, made me silent in perswading or disswading one way or other; though, I con∣fess, I like better of his continuance, considering his late de∣sire to his book, and profitable endeavours thence amounting; w<SUP>ch</SUP>, if it were not so surely, love shou'd not so blind me, as to
<PB N="473" REF="502"/>
abuse your wor. with any the like relation. For though I con∣fess I affect him more than I think I shall ever do kinsman after him; yet, as <HI>Pliny</HI> speaks of his friend, <HI>Amo cum judicio, eo{que} magis quo magis amo.</HI></P>
<P>His scholarship being gone, upon his return from <HI>London</HI> I was bold to put him unto fellows commons, until, either in this or some other coll. I shall enquire out some fellowship for him; of the w<SUP>ch</SUP> preferment he shall not be capable until he be full bachelor of arts; and that will be <HI>Easter</HI> at soonest. This re∣moving of him to our commons, will be some ten pounds a year more chargeable unto you; but I do hold his choice of company (w<SUP>ch</SUP> now can be none but fellows and gentlemen) and his occasion of hearing their discourses, will, in your own judgment, countervail the charges: only this, for his entrance you are to bestow a silver piece of plate upon the college, of what price you please, above 5 marks; and to engrave your arms thereupon: and that is all the charge of admission.</P>
<P>He shall not want an honourable place in commencing, since you are content to undergo the charges.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, for your charges always with me. Your former so many courtesies, devoided of all requital of my side, might very well free your wor. from any future cost that way. I have indeed with my proctorship light upon a most loving and respectful lord, my lord chancellor; who hath rather an indulgent fatherly care of my estate, than a lordly respect, as I have, by many immediate favors, lately tasted.</P>
<P>It was likewise my good fortune, for I do not, I protest, at∣tribute it to any merit, to give his majesty, and the prince, some extraordinary contentment at <HI>Newmarket</HI> upon <HI>Tuesday</HI>
<PB N="474" REF="503"/>
last; what time, by appointment, I preach'd before them. I had a great deal of court holy water, if I can make myself any good thereby.</P>
<P>I pray you, Sir, by <HI>Lent</HI> next, when your son is capable of a place, let there be some order taken, that the money you are willing to disburse for his place, be at <HI>London</HI> in some readi∣ness for me to call for; for <HI>magistri nostri oculatas habent manus, credunt quod vident.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the remembrance of my love and best affections unto you—Being very sensible of that great good will you have ever borne me, I thought it not unnecessarie to take this course with you, which I have done with noe one other freynd in the worlde, as to desire you to be noe more troubled with this late accident befallen unto me, than you shall under∣stand I am myselfe. There is nothinge happened which I did not foresee, and (sithence the death of my dear maister) assuredlye expect; nor laye it in my power to prevent, otherwise than by the sacrifisinge of my poor estate, and that which I esteeme farre above the same, my reputation. I knowe you love me to well, to wishe that I shold have been lavishe of either of these, to continue longer (yeat noe longer then one man pleas'd) in this glorious miserye and splendid slaverye, wherein I have lived (if a man maye call such a toilinge a livinge) for these five years almost. By loosinge the seale, I have lost nothinge, nor my servants, by any fault of myne; there beinge nothinge either layde, or soe much as whispered to my charge. If we have not the opportunitye we hadd before to serve the kinge, we have much more conveniencye to serve God; which I doe em∣brace
<PB N="476" REF="505"/>
as the onelye end of Gods love and providence towards me, in this sudden alteraltion.</P>
<P>For your sonne <HI>Owen Wynne</HI> (who, togeither with my debte, is all the object of my wordlye thoughts and cares) I will per∣forme towards him all that he can have expected from me, if I live; and if I dye, I have performed it allreadye.</P>
<P>You neede not feare any misse of me, beinge soe just and re∣served in all your desires and requests; havinge alsoe your eldest sonne near the kinge, and of good reputation in the court, who can give you a good accompt of any thinge you shall re∣commend unto him.</P>
<P>Hopinge therefore that I shall ever hold the same place I did in your love; which was first fixed on my person, not my late place, and which I will deserve by all the freindlye and lovinge offices which shall lie in my power; I end with my prayer unto God for the continuance of your health; and doe rest your very assured loveinge freynd, and cozen,</P>

<HEAD>CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS TO THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE WELSH TOUR.</HEAD>
<P>PAGE 6. Half a league—read—half a mile; for that is the sense of <HI>Leuca</HI> in the Doomsday Book. See <HI>Dugdale's War∣wickshire,</HI> i. 46.</P>
<P>Page 8. I find that coals were discovered in the township of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> as early as the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. as appears by an extent of that place, in the twenty-third year of that reign <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sebright</HI> MSS.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Page 26. In the grant to the abby of <HI>Basingwork,</HI> of the lands in the peak of <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> there is a clause, reserving the venison to the king, with the consent of the abbot and convent; for the preservation of which, two foresters were appointed by the king; but the grantees were allowed to kill hares, foxes, and wolves <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

but his prowess in battle; and compliments him on having beautified and enlarged the abby. Among other luxuries, I think he enumerates sugar; which might well be, for sugar was a great article of commerce in <HI>Sicily,</HI> as early as the year 1148; so a rich abbot might easily indulge himself in it in the fifteenth century <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright <HI>MSS.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Page 36. <HI>James</HI> II. in his progress to <HI>Holywell,</HI> gave, as marks of his favor, golden rings, with his hair plaited beneath a crystal. One is still preserved in a neighboring family, which he had bestowed on the Roman Catholic Minister of <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>
<P>Page 82. That the <HI>British</HI> commanders used to stand on a turfy mount, or tribunal, to harangue their soldiers, is evident from the authority of <HI>Dio Cassius,</HI> lib. lxii. who informs us, that <HI>Boadicea</HI> delivered her animating speech from an eminence of this kind.</P>
<P>Page the same. <HI>William Parry,</HI> LL.D. and member for <HI>Queensborough,</HI> was born at <HI>Northop.</HI> He was executed before the door of the parlament-house, in 1584, for designing the death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He had before rendered himself obnoxious, for having had the courage to speak against the bill for the expulsion of popish priests, &amp;c. was committed to prison for his freedom, but restored on making submission. He as∣serted, that his mother was a <HI>Conway,</HI> of <HI>Boddrudan;</HI> that his father had thirty children by two wives, and died aged 108. His enemies, on the contrary, say he was of mean parents: but
<PB N="187" REF="531"/>
be that as it was, his abilities were considerable; but his dupli∣city brought him to his fatal end. He went a voluntary spy to foreign parts, was gained over by the <HI>Romish</HI> party, probably meant to deceive both sides; so fell a just victim to his artifices. See <HI>Stripe's Annals.</HI></P>
<P>Page 97. <HI>Hawarden</HI> castle was then garrisoned for the par∣lament, by a hundred and fifty men of Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton</HI>'s regiment.</P>

<P>Page 105. Lord Chancellor <HI>Egerton</HI> was buried at <HI>Doddleston,</HI> out of affection to his wife <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> daughter of <HI>Thomas Ra∣venscrost,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Breton.</HI> His mother had been a servant maid in the parish; but was the daughter of one <HI>Sparks,</HI> of <HI>Bickerton.</HI> I have heard this remarkable anecdote of her, and the fortunate child: The mother had been so much neglected by Sir <HI>Richard Egerton,</HI> of <HI>Ridley,</HI> the father of the boy, that she was reduced to beg for support. A neighboring gentleman, a friend of Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> saw her asking alms, followed by her child. He ad∣mired its beauty, and saw in it the evident features of the knight. He immediately went to Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> and layed before him the disgrace of suffering his own offspring, illegitimate as it was, to wander from door to door. He was affected with the reproof,
<PB N="188" REF="532"/>
adopted the child, and by a proper education, layed the founda∣tion of its future fortune.</P>

<P>Page 213. <HI>Holt Castle</HI> was surrendered to colonel <HI>Pope,</HI> by agreement with general <HI>Mytton,</HI> who had left the place before possession was taken of it.</P>
<P>Page 214. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> ever attentive to her <HI>prerogatives,</HI> clamed the <HI>mise</HI> on her accession, in <HI>November</HI> 1558. She ap∣pointed a commission for the receit; but met with opposition in the town of <HI>Caermarthen,</HI> by the inhabitants, who alleged, that greater sums had been raised in their county, in the reigns of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and <HI>Edward</HI> VI. than was answered to the prince. Several were imprisoned for their resistance, but afterwards re∣leased; and on their petition a compromise was made, that when∣ever a subsidy was granted to the prince, no mise should be given; and the reverse when a mise was received <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stripe's Annals,</HI> i. Introduction, p. 14. who adds, that originally corn and wine was given at the accession, to support the prince's houshold.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Page 218. The mistake about the Sir <HI>Thomas Hanmer,</HI> speaker of the house of commons, is rectified by a leaf at the close of

this, with which the possessor of the <HI>Welsh Tour</HI> is desired to re∣place pp. 217. 218. of the first volume.</P>
<P>Page 225. An extent was made in the twenty-eighth of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> I. at <HI>Overton,</HI> before <HI>Richard de Mascy,</HI> justice of <HI>Chester,</HI> by which it appears, that the king had a mill there worth twelve, pounds a year, and a fishery worth twenty; which shews the great∣ness of the value of the latter in those days. The only fish worth attending to, must have been salmon. It was an important article, not only in private families, but, in those days, for the support of armies. In <HI>Rymer</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">iii. 95.</NOTE> is an order for three thousand dried sal∣mon, issued by <HI>Edward</HI> II. in 1308, in order to enable him to set his troops in motion, to wage war against <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

A certain spot hear <HI>Soddylt,</HI> near this village, divides <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI>—the provinces of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York</HI>—the dioceses of <HI>Litchfield and Coventry, Chester,</HI> and <HI>St. Asaph</HI> —the counties of <HI>Salop, Flint,</HI> and <HI>Denbigh</HI> —the hundreds of <HI>Oswestry, Maytor,</HI> and <HI>Bromfield</HI>—the parishes of <HI>Ellesmere, Overton,</HI> and <HI>Erbistock</HI>—the townships of <HI>Duddleston, Knolton,</HI> and <HI>Erbistock.</HI></P>

<P>Page 250. Whose house—read—the use of which.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="534"/>Page 255. <HI>Richard</HI> II. with the committee of parlement, in this town determined that the great dispute between the duke of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Mowbray</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> should be decided by single combat at <HI>Coventry;</HI> both dukes having appeared before the king at <HI>Oswestry,</HI> after the dissolution of the parlement held at <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI>— <HI>Drake,</HI> i. 519.</P>
<P>Page 260. <HI>Cae Dwn,</HI> or rather <HI>Cae Twn.</HI> The last, accord∣ing to doctor <HI>Davies,</HI> signifies <HI>fractura,</HI> than which nothing can be more expressive of the ending of this famous work, which, as I have not long since observed, terminates in a flat cultivated country, on the farm of <HI>Cae Twn,</HI> near <HI>Tryddyn</HI> chapel, in the pa∣rish of <HI>Mold.</HI> The termination is remote from any hill, or place of strength: it is therefore reasonable to imagine, that this mighty attempt was here suddenly interrupted by some cause, of which we must ever remain ignorant.</P>
<P>Page 263. Sir <HI>John Owen</HI> was of this house, but not of the family, of <HI>Owen Brogyntyn.</HI> He was descended from <HI>Hwfa ap Cynddelw,</HI> one of the fifteen tribes of <HI>North Wales.</HI> Before Sir <HI>John Owen</HI>'s family enjoyed the place, it had been long possessed by the <HI>Lacons.</HI> It passed from them to Sir <HI>William Morris,</HI> of <HI>Clenenny,</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> by virtue of his marriage with the daughter of <HI>William Wynne Lacon,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and was conveyed into the family of the present owner by the marriage of the grand∣daughter of that match with <HI>John,</HI> fourth son of <HI>Robert Owen,</HI> of <HI>Bôdsilin,</HI> in <HI>Anglesea.</HI> This gentleman (who was father of Sir <HI>John</HI>) had been secretary to the great <HI>Walsingham,</HI> and made a fortune of ten thousand pounds; a sum perhaps despised by
<PB N="191" REF="535"/>
modern secretaries, but a vast one in those days. His master did not take such good care of himself, for he did not leave suf∣ficient to defray his funeral expences.</P>
<P>Page 279. LLANGOLLEN. In the old church was formerly a recumbent figure, in alabaster, of a churchman, supposed to have been <HI>St. Collen.</HI></P>
<P>Page 294. <HI>Elihu Yale</HI> had been governor of <HI>Madras,</HI> and probably a very despotic one. He hanged his groom for riding out with his horse to take the air for two or three days, without his leave, for which <HI>Yale</HI> was called to severe account in <HI>England.</HI> — <HI>Harris's Coll. Voy.</HI> i. 917.</P>
<P>Page the same. The fine brazen eagle, which serves as a reading-desk in <HI>Wrexham</HI> church, was the gift of <HI>John ap Gryffydd ap David,</HI> of <HI>Plâs Ystivan,</HI> in that neighborhood, in the year 1254. Its price was six pounds. — <HI>Halston</HI> MSS.</P>
<P>Page 295. The steeple at <HI>Wrexham</HI> must have been built se∣veral years after the church, if an account I received lately from a friend is well founded, that the church was built a little before the year 1472, and in that year it was glazed with glass from <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>Page 296. Chancellor <HI>Jeffries</HI> has by him the purse, the badge of his office, and is dressed in his baron's robes.</P>
<P>Page 297. His brother, Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> was knight of <HI>Alcan∣tara;</HI> and for the honor of the descendants of <HI>Tudor Trevor,</HI> from whom the <HI>Jeffries</HI> are sprung, the proofs of his descent were
<PB N="192" REF="536"/>
were admired even by the proud <HI>Spaniards,</HI> among whom he re∣sided long as consul at <HI>Alicant</HI> and <HI>Madrid.</HI> He had rendered himself so acceptable to the <HI>Spanish</HI> ministry, as to be recom∣mended to our court to succeed lord <HI>Landsdown</HI> as <HI>British</HI> envoy; but the revolution put a stop to the promotion.</P>
<P>Page 300. In the neighborhood of <HI>Gresford</HI> stood the <HI>Lower Gwersilt,</HI> a house burnt down <HI>April</HI> the 20th, 1738, by which the country lost the worthy and respectable family of the <HI>Sha∣kerlies,</HI> who settled there soon after the restoration. They were originally of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> but removed to this place almost imme∣diately on the return of the royal family. Colonel (afterwards Sir <HI>Jeffry</HI>) <HI>Shakerly</HI> was a distinguished loyalist, and had the command of a regiment of horse under <HI>Charles</HI> I. During his service, he contracted a great frindship with colone <HI>Robinson,</HI> owner of the <HI>Upper Gwersilt;</HI> which induced him, soon after the year 1660, to purchase this estate from captain <HI>Sutton,</HI> an old cavalier, descended from <HI>Tudor Trevor,</HI> and ruined in the royal cause. This the colonel did, not only to re-place a considerable estate he had been obliged to sell in <HI>Kent,</HI> in support of the cause, but to be near his friend and fellow-soldier. No mention is made of him in any of the histories of our civil commotions, notwithstanding he was engagd in most of the actions of any note. The following account of what preceded the battle of <HI>Rowton-Heath,</HI> near <HI>Chester,</HI> is extremely curious, and merits pre∣servation; which I deliver in the manner I received it, by the favor of his grand-son, <HI>Peter Shakerley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="537"/>"THE heath upon which Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> was drawn up, carries the name of <HI>Rowton Heath;</HI> a mile beyond which, in the <HI>London</HI> road from <HI>Chester,</HI> is another heath, called <HI>Hatton Heath.</HI> The order which Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> had received from the king, was only to beat <HI>Poyntz</HI> back. Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> performed, the same effectually; for having marched his men over <HI>Holt Bridge</HI> undiscovered by the enemy, who had taken the out-works and suburbs of the city on the east-side thereof, and <HI>Poyntz</HI> coming in a marching posture along the narrow lane be∣tween <HI>Hatton Heath</HI> and <HI>Rowton Heath,</HI> Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> having lined the hedges, fell upon him, and killed a great many of his men; and having so done, ordered colonel <HI>Shakerley,</HI> who was best acquainted with that country, to get the next way he could to the king (who lodged then at Sir <HI>Francis Gamull</HI>'s house, in <HI>Chester</HI>) and acquaint him, that he had obeyed his orders in beat∣ing <HI>Poyntz</HI> back, and to know, his majesty's further pleasure. The colonel executed his orders with better speed than could have been expected; for he gallopped directly to the river <HI>Dee,</HI> under <HI>Huntingdon House,</HI> got a wooden tub (used for slaughtering of swine) and a batting-staff (used for batting of coarse linen) for an oar, put a servant into the tub with him, and in this despe∣rate manner swam over the river, his horse swimming by him (for the banks were there very steep, and the river very deep) ordered his servant to stay there with the tub for his return, and was with the king in little more than a quarter of an hour after he had left Sir <HI>Marmaduke,</HI> and acquainted the king, that if his Majesty pleased to command further orders to Sir <HI>Marmaduke,</HI>
<PB N="194" REF="538"/>
he would engage to deliver them in a quarter of an hour; and told the king of the expeditious method he had taken, which saved him the going nine or ten miles about, by <HI>Holt Bridge</HI> (for the boats at <HI>Eaton</HI> were then made useless); but such delays were used by some about the king, that no orders were sent, nor any sally made out of the city by the king's party, till past three o'clock afternoon, which was full six hours after <HI>Poyniz</HI> had been beaten back; and so <HI>Poyntz</HI> having all that time for his men to recover the fright they had been put into in the morning, <HI>Poyntz</HI> rallied his forces, and with the help of the parlement forces who came out of the suburbs of the city to his assistance (upon whom the king's party in the city might then successfully have fallen) put all those of the king's to the rout, which was the loss of the king's horse, and of his design to join <HI>Montross</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was then understood to be in a good condition.</P>
<P>"THIS is what my father, the said colonel <HI>Shakerley</HI> (afterwards Sir <HI>Geffrey Shakerley</HI>) hath often declared in my hearing; and since no mention is made of him in all this history (though he faithfully, served the king in all the wars, was personally engaged in almost all the field battles for the king, sold part of his estate to support that service, and was for many years sequestered of all the rest) I thought it my duty, as his eldest son and heir, to do that justice to his memory, to insert this here, under my hand, that it may be remembered to posterity.</P>

<P><PB N="195" REF="539"/>Page 321. An antient chronicle speaks of the phoenomenon of the comet in these terms: <Q>And in the iiii yere of Kyng <HI>Henrie</HI>'s reigne, ther was a sterre seyn in the firmament y<SUP>t</SUP> shewed him self thurgh all the world for di'use tokenynges y<SUP>t</SUP> shuld befall sone after: the which sterre was named and called by <HI>Clargie, Stella Comata.</HI></Q> — <HI>Caxton's Croniclis,</HI> printed at <HI>St. Alban's.</HI></P>
<P>Page 369. The valley in which the abby of <HI>Valle Crucis</HI> stands, was called, prior to the foundation of that religious house, <HI>Pant y Groes,</HI> or <HI>The Bottom of the Cross,</HI> I suppose from that erected in memory of <HI>Eliseg. Madoc</HI>'s charter was addressed to the monks of four different monasteries, who, I imagine, were to have charge of the building, which took many years to finish. — <HI>Sebright MSS.</HI></P>
<P>THE bard <HI>Guttun Owain</HI> composed two <HI>Owdls</HI> in praise of <HI>Davydd ap Jevan ap Jerwerth,</HI> and of <HI>Sîon,</HI> both abbots of this house. He highly commends their hospitality; speaks of their having four courses of meat, bright silver dishes, claret, &amp;c. <HI>Guttun</HI> does not forget the piety of the house, and is particularly happy in being blessed by abbot <HI>John</HI> with his three fingers co∣vered with rings.</P>
<P>IN another place is mentioned <HI>Sîon ap William ap Sîon,</HI> as the person who adjudged the prize at the last <HI>Eisteddfod at Caerwys,</HI> in 1568. — <HI>The same MSS.</HI></P>
<P>THE freemen of <HI>Llangollen</HI> made a grant, in part of the river near their town, of a fishery to the monks of <HI>Valle Crucis.</HI> For want of a seal of their own, they affixed to their grant that of
<PB N="196" REF="540"/>
<HI>Madoc,</HI> the founder of the abby. The monks erected new works on the river, for the purpose of taking the fish: this caused a dispute between them and the freemen. The last referred it to the abbot and five monks of their own choice, who were to ad∣just the matter on oath. <HI>Madoc</HI> and his secretary, <HI>John Parvus,</HI> appointed a day for the purpose. The assembly was held; the oath solemnly administered; and the abbot and monks made the decision in their own favor. They alleged, that they had bought the right of erecting what works they pleased, and of re∣pairing of them, from the heirs of <HI>Llangollen.</HI> The prince con∣firmed the decree, and the donation of the fishery, by an instru∣ment, dated in 1234.</P>
<P>THIS house was demolished in 1235, and is said to have been the first of the <HI>Welsh</HI> that underwent that fate.</P>
<P>Page 400. <HI>Reinault</HI> received his pardon from <HI>Thomas</HI> lord <HI>Stanley,</HI> lord of the council for <HI>Wales;</HI> and it was afterwards confirmed by <HI>Edward</HI> IV. under the great seal. — <HI>Tower MSS.</HI></P>
<P>Page 406. The first charter given to <HI>Hope,</HI> was by <HI>Edward</HI> the black prince, dated from <HI>Chester,</HI> in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of his father, or 1351. He orders that the constable of the castle for the time being should be the mayor, who was, after taking the sacrament, to swear on the holy evangelists, that he would preserve the priveleges of the burgesses, granted in the said charter; and that he should chuse out of them annually, on <HI>Michaelmas</HI>-day, two bailiffs. He adds also most of the other advantages granted in the charters of those times: all which were afterwards confirmed by <HI>Richard</HI> II. — <HI>Sebright MSS.</HI></P>

<P>Page 433. <HI>Caerwys.</HI> An <HI>Eisteddfod</HI> held there in the fif∣teenth of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. <HI>July</HI> the 2d, in which the old laws are confirmed respecting bards, in the manner I recite. <HI>Richard ap Howel ap Jevan Vychan,</HI> of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Gryffydd,</HI> and Sir <HI>Roger Salusbury,</HI> presided, assisted by <HI>Gryffydd ap Evan ap Llewelyn Vychan,</HI> and <HI>Tyder Aled,</HI> a famous bard.</P>
<P>A <HI>Pencerdd</HI> might challenge any other to rehearse or sing for the prize, after giving a year and a day's notice. If he suc∣ceeded, he carried it off; if not, he lost his degree; and the victor kept the prize for life, but was obliged to produce it an∣nually on the <HI>Eisteddfod.</HI></P>
