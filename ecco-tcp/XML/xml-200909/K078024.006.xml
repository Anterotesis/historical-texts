<P>Papilio Arion is a very scarce Insect in this country; and it does not appear to be much more common in any other part of Europe. The authors quoted above have given figures or descriptions of it, but are entirely ignorant of its larva, or pupa; and Fabricius, who has selected the observations of all the preceding authors who have de∣scribed it, says only, <HI>Habitat in Europae Pratis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12"/>Mr. Lemon, a collector of eminence some years since, met with it in England. We have a specimen which was taken by him, as appears from a note with it.

<P>Three specimens of this rare species were found together, con∣cealed in the porous part of the Honey-comb Boletus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boletus Cellulosus.</NOTE>. According to <HI>Herbst. Archiv.</HI> it is usually found on plants of this genus. It is not scarce in Germany.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>The vast addition of new species of Insects that <HI>Fabricius</HI> has made in his latter works, renders it difficult, and in some instances impossible, to refer them to the system of <HI>Linnaeus;</HI> and though we would at all times more willingly refer any new kind to that system, and quote the Fabrician account amongst the synonyms, than adopt the new generic distinctions of Fabricius, or any other author, we must not sacrifice propriety to predilection. If Linnaeus himself had noticed many of the newly discovered kinds, he must have altered and improved his system to admit them; which is a great excuse for Fabricius having made so many genera.</P>
<P>The little Insect before us may be referred to the Silpha genus of Linnaeus; but as his definition of the Silphae has been subjected to so many objections and amendments of later authors, we forbear placing it amongst them. Linnaeus has made no distinction between such species as have perfoliated antennae, and those with antennae increasing in bulk from the base to the end <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Silpha Antennae</HI> extrorsum crassiores. <HI>Elytra</HI> marginata. <HI>Caput</HI> prominens. <HI>Thorax</HI> planiusculus, marginatus. <HI>Linn. Gen. Ins.</HI></NOTE>, thereby including <HI>S. Vespillo</HI> with <HI>S. thoracica</HI> and <HI>S. obscura,</HI> though in an early edition of the <HI>Fauna Suecica, S. Vespillo</HI> was amongst the <HI>Scarabaei,</HI> and the two last with the <HI>Cassidae.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Schoeffer</HI> divided the Silphae of Linnaeus into two genera, <HI>Silpha</HI> and <HI>Peltis. Geoffroy</HI> arranged some of them amongst his <HI>Dermestides,</HI> and formed his genus <HI>Peltis</HI> of such as have the thorax and elytra strongly margined, and perfoliated antennae. <HI>Geoffroy</HI> described our present subject under the name <HI>Tritoma. Fabricius</HI> afterwards, in his Mantissa, arranged it under <HI>Ips,</HI> a new genus, formed from part of the <HI>Silphae</HI> of Linnaeus and <HI>Dermestides</HI> of Geoffroy. In the Entomologia Systematica, he has again separated the Ips, and made <HI>Mycetophagus</HI> a new genus of fifteen species, in which he includes this Insect.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17"/>To those who have adopted the system of Fabricius, it is unne∣cessary to say, that the fundamental part of his arrangement is taken from the mouth of the Insect, which certainly is objectionable, be∣cause that part is dry, and very frequently injured or destroyed in Insects that have been long in a cabinet, and is very small in most kinds when allve; so that, though we have followed his arrangement in the generic definition, we have been less prolix than a full eluci∣dation of it might require.</P>

<P>This Insect was formerly held in great esteem amongst the English collectors, on account of its rarity; and has been purchased for their cabinets at a considerable price <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Half a guinea was the usual price for a pair of them.</NOTE>. The late Mr. Bentley, who
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
had been more than twenty years endeavouring to make his cabinet the most complete in England, never met with it.</P>
<P>About three years since, they were taken in great plenty near London, both at Battersea and Highgate; and have been met with in other places since that time. Like the Ephemerae, and other gause-wing Insects, it delights in moist places, particularly among the reeds. The larva is unknown, but we suppose that it lives in that state in the water; and which most likely it does not leave till it becomes a winged creature. The larva of some species of this genus feed on the smaller kinds of Insects.</P>
<P>The wings are the most pleasing objects for the microscope that can be imagined: the reticulations and feathered edges are so trans∣parent, that they may be examined with the deepest magnifiers, which is an advantage few objects of such a size possess. The magnified figure is given, with the natural size in the annexed plate.</P>
<P>Fabricius has erroneously quoted the seventh and eighth figure of the fifth plate of <HI>Schaeffer</HI>'s <HI>Icones,</HI> which is certainly no other than the common kind, Hemorobius perla, and which is so often found in gardens with a fine golden eye.

<P>This Insect has been confounded with Phalaena lubricipeda by Linnaeus; he makes it the variety β after De Geer. In this he has been followed by many other authors; and though Roesel, by giving the larva and pupa of each, in two distinct plates, evidently thought them different species, his observations had no weight with other Naturalists; even Fabricius, in his <HI>Species Insectorum,</HI> gives them
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
under one specific name.

Verz.</HI> 54. 2. Fabricius mentions it as a native of Germany, but from the figure of Roesel no doubt can be entertained of its being precisely the same as our English species.</P>
<P>The Caterpillars of both sorts are very general feeders; they will eat, oak, fruit trees, and wild plants of almost every kind. They are common in the summer, change to chrysalis about August, and appear in the winged state in May and June; but, there is more than one brood of them in the course of the year, so that the time of their appearance is uncertain. The Caterpillars change their skins often; and change their colours at the same time. Those of Phalaena Menthrastri when small are a very light transparent brown: then brown with dark stripes. It is not black till it is in the last skin; and then, in many, the colour inclines to brown.</P>

<P>The Sphinx Celerio stands pre-eminent in the list of the Insects of this country, whether we consider its rarity, or uncommon beauty. Indeed, amongst the Insects of this tribe that are brought from remote countries, even from Asia, which boasts the most splendid species, the varieties of Sphinx Celerio are often the most beautiful; it must however be owned, that, in countries where the
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
climate, and luxuriance of the soil contribute to enrich the juices of the plants on which the Insects are nourished, they are larger and their colours more vivid than any of the same kind produced in the northern countries of Europe.</P>
<P>Several years since, Mr. Francillon, of Norfolk-street in the Strand, had a living specimen of this Insect brought to him: it was taken in Bunhill-fields burying-ground. It is still preserved in his cabinet.</P>
<P>We have heard of other specimens being taken in this country; but the only instance we can quote with confidence is, that Mr. Latham, formerly of Dartford, and well known for his scientific researches in natural history, has a specimen which was taken at Eltham, in Kent. Few collections of consequence are without this Insect, but they are in general natives of Germany.</P>
<P>Roesel has given a figure of this Sphinx, with its larva and pupa; and, as we could never reasonably expect to meet with it in these states in England, correct copies of his figures are given in Plate 191. The works of Roesel are not in the hands of many; and, we are convinced that Plate will be acceptable to most of our readers.</P>
<P>Sphinx Celerio is found on the vine.</P>

<P>The Sirex genus, as it stands in the <HI>Entomologia Systematica</HI> of Fabribius, includes only twenty-six species; these are chiefly Euro∣pean Insects; but very few are natives of this country. The Sirex Gigas is found in the north of Europe; it has been taken in England, but very rarely: Yeats and Berkenhout mention it as a British species, and we have been informed that it is sometimes taken in Scotland. It is likely to be met with in Pine forests, as the female seems to prefer that wood to deposit her eggs in. As no English Entomologist has attempted to describe the peculiar habits of this tribe of Insects, and especially of Sirex Gigas, the following particulars may be satisfactory to our readers.</P>
<P>The extensive forests of Germany furnished the accurate Roesel with many opportunities of finding and observing the metamorphosis of Insects that are rarely to be found in other parts of Europe; and this enabled him to favour the world with a particular description and series of figures of all the changes of Sirex Gigas, in the <HI>Bom∣byliorum et Vesparum</HI> of his <HI>Insecten Belustigung.</HI> His figure of the female Insect agrees with that we have given; the male is consi∣derably smaller, and has no sting <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a generical distinction.</NOTE>. The sting of the female consists of three parts, a sheath which divides into two parts or valves, and a fine instrument somewhat resembling a needle; it is with this in∣strument it wounds its enemies, and the sting is said to cause an excruciating pain. The microscope discovers this part to be beset with a number of very minute teeth, like the edge of a saw: with this sting the creature can pierce the wood of sound trees; for we suspect, it does not always deposit its eggs in such as are decayed, but rather in such as will supply the larva with nourishment when it is hatched. The eggs are laid in clusters of two or three hundred together; they are of a pale yellow colour, about the thirtieth part of an inch in length, and shaped like a weaver's shuttle. The larva lives in the body of the tree, enlarging its habitation as it increases in size, for it never leaves the tree till it becomes a winged creature.
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
The larva when full grown is about an inch and a quarter in length, and as thick as a goose quill. It is a heavy sluggish creature, almost cylindrical, the head very small, and the whole of an uniform pellucid yellowish colour. It has a small spine at the end of the body like those by which the larva of some spinges are distinguished: this spine is also a striking character in the perfect Sirex. In the pupa the form of the winged creature is more visible than in the larva state; it is of a browner colour than the larva, and the rudiment of the sting and legs are very visible.</P>
<P>In the early editions of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus, the sirices are arranged with the ichneumons in one genus; but later observations induced Linnaeus to make two genera of them in his last works. <HI>Geoffroy</HI> and Schaeffer have added some particulars to the Linnaean generic character; these principally relate to the num∣ber of joints in the tarsi.</P>

<P>This singular creature not only changes its skin several times; but, as it advances in age the segments of which the body is composed increase in number: the Insect when full grown has nine such seg∣ments. Linnaeus mentions it as a native of America: in many
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
parts of Europe it is not uncommon: in England it is found under loose stones in damp places, and runs swiftly.</P>
<P>Fabricius has made a false quotation under this species to the Fundamenta Entomologica of <HI>Schaeffer;</HI> as errors will occur in the most accurrate works, we should not deem it necessary to notice this circumstance, if he had not continued the same mistake from his Species Insectorum published in 1781 to his last work Ento∣mologia Systematica, <HI>emenda et aucta, &amp;c.</HI> published in 1793.— his reference is <HI>Schaeff.

Scolopendra forficata is given in the 46th plate of Vol. I. of that author's <HI>Icones Insectorum circa Rastisbonam indigenorum, &amp;c.</HI> as quoted amongst the synonyms above.</P>
<P>The Scolopendra forficata is, we believe, the largest of the genus found in this country. In many parts of the world, some kinds are found of a frightful size and aspect; the Scolopendra Morsitans of the East-Indies, is about five inches in length, and as thick as a goose quill. Sir G. Staunton, in his Historical Account of the Embassy to China, mentions the Scolopendras and scorpions of that country: we have one species of the former from China that ex∣ceeds in magnitude every one of the genus we have seen from other parts of the world, and is perhaps the largest known; it is near one foot in length, and is about one inch and an half round the girth of the body; the colour is of a fine shining chestnut brown, the legs inclining to yellow. The most singular Insect of this kind in England is the Scolopendra electrica, which sometimes omits a spark or flash of light in the dark.</P>

<P>In colours and markings the Comma Butterfly seems at first sight allied to <HI>Papilio Urticae (Tortoiseshell Butterfly),</HI> but the elegant scal∣lops of the margins of the wings sufficiently distinguishes it

from every other British species: indeed wings indentated in this remarkable manner are rarely seen in any Insects, those from foreign countries not excepted. <HI>Papilio Gaureum,</HI> a native of Asia according to Fabricius, and figured amongst the Insects found in North Ame∣rica, by <HI>Abbot,</HI> approaches nearer to it than any distinct species we are acquainted with.

<P>There is more than one brood of this species in a year: the But∣terflies are generally found in June, the second brood late in August. The Caterpillars are sometimes found in February, but oftener in July; they remain about a fortnight in chrysalis.</P>

<P>The trivial appellation, <HI>Clifden Beauty,</HI> has been given to this Insect by some early English entomologists, who had not met with it in any other part of the country. It has since been taken in several other parts of the kingdom; but in Kent particularly.

<P>Simple as this little creature may appear to the general reader, the Entomologists of this country esteem it a rarity; for it was not imagined that England produced any species of its singular genus till lately.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="68"/>Mr. Yeats, in his Institutions of Entomology, mentions two spe∣cies of it that have been caught in this country; one by Mr. <HI>Hudson,</HI> author of the <HI>Flora Anglica,</HI> the other by Mr. <HI>Grey.</HI> It is to be lamented, that he does not inform us precisely what were the species. We learn that Fulgora Europaea was the Insect taken by Mr. Hudson; the other seems undetermined.</P>
<P>The Fulgora Europaea very much resembles some of the Cicadae in form and size, and have, therefore, been probably overlooked by English collectors of Insects. Fabricius describes it as a native of France and Germany; but it is very scarce in cabinets of foreign Insects also. Perhaps it is not common in any country.</P>
<P>This species does not exhibit any prominent features of its sin∣gular genus; it has only a small conic hollow projection, or lantern, on the fore-part of the head, instead of the large projection that charac∣terise most of the exotic Fulgorae. It is not unlikely, however, that it may possess, though in a small degree, the astonishing property of diffusing a radiance of light, which particularly distinguish <HI>F. Lan∣ternarid</HI> of South America, <HI>F. Candelaria</HI> of China, and several other species. The light of some of these Insects, according to the reports of Naturalists, and travellers in foreign countries, is suffi∣ciently vivid and constant to answer many purposes. Some of the Catholic missionaries assert, that they could see distinctly to read and write by the light of one of them; and that several of them being fastened together, serve to light the Indians when they travel in the night.</P>
<P>The rostrum, or beak, through which the Fulgorae Europaea (like others of the same genus) sucks its nutriment, seems to form a part of the hollow projection in the front of the head; the tube lays close to the belly, between the six legs. To explain the singular structure of this tube or rostrum, we have given a front and a profile view of it as it appeared under the lens of a microscope.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="69"/>Our specimen is altogether green, except the wings; the recticu∣lations of which are also of the same colour; and as in Sulzer's figure, the clear parts of the wings were strongly tinged with green also.</P>

The underside is entirely of a shining dark co∣lour, with innumerable waved streaks of black. The upperside is represented in the annexed plate.</P>
<P>The Caterpillars, which are black, beset with spines, and ele∣gantly marked with rows of white spots, are frequently found feed∣ing on the nettles, and other low herbage by the sides of ditches. They change to the chrysalis state the first week in July, and appear in the winged state twenty-one days after.</P>

<P>Papilio Machaon and Papilio Podalirius are the only two species of Swallow-tail Butterflies that have been found in England. Both are very scarce, but Papilio Machaon less so than Papilio Poda∣lirius, of which a figure has been given in another part of this work.</P>
<P>Entomologists mention several parts of the country in which it has been taken, both in the larva and winged state. Harris says it feeds on wild fennel and carrots; that one he found remained in the chry∣salis state from the 23d of September to May the 15th following, and another, that changed July the 15th, produced a butterfly the 10th of August. He adds, that the species was found in the mea∣dows of Bristol and Westram.</P>
<P>From the number of foreign authors who have given figures of the Butterfly, we may imagine that it is very common on the Con∣tinent. Those preserved in cabinets of English Insects are gene∣rally brought from Germany, from whence also we sometimes receive preserved specimens of the Caterpillars.</P>

That author described only a small number of the species, and was even doubtful whether several that were placed under that division of his system did not more properly belong to some other, especially to the ichneumons, among which several apterous insects are included.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="95"/>The cause of this uncertainty may be partly attributed to our entire ignorance of their manner of life or transformations. Some of the Mutillae have wings, and others are without. Authors have con∣sidered the apterous Insects as the females, and the winged kind as the males, which opinion is countenanced by numberless instances in almost every class of Insects. Others have however maintained that both males and females were winged, and that the apterous In∣sects were neuters, presuming in support of such opinion, that the Mutillae lived in societies like the Wasps, Ants, and Bees.—From observations on a number of exotic species of this tribe, we have no doubt that the winged Insects are males, and the apterous kind females.</P>
<P>Yeats alludes to three species of Mutillae that have been found in England, but names only the Mutillae Europaea; and this is the only kind we have ever found. We have taken it on a sandy path∣way, near the entrance of Coombe Wood, Surry.</P>

<P>When the late Duchess of Portland honoured the scientific as well as practical part of Entomology with her patronage, her Grace discovered, and reared from the caterpillars several species of Phalaena, of which collectors were ignorant before. Phalaena Praecox is among the number of those her Grace found in one of the Portland isles; and the specimen we have figured is one which formed part of her collection.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="98"/>Fabricius says the larva feeds on the thistle. The rarity of this creature induced us to depart from our usual method, and copy the larva and pupa from the plate in the works of Roesel, apprehending it would be particularly interesting to English naturalists in general, as that author alone has represented it in those states; and no col∣lector that we are informed has met with it within the last fifteen years.</P>

<P>As the Phalaenae are not remarkable for a variety of gay colours, like those of the Papilio genus, an exception to a general rule in the beautiful species before us, more strongly demands our notice. The male Phalaena Russula, which is known by the pectinated an∣tennae, is of a fine golden yellow, with a rich, though narrow mar∣ginal band of sanguineous red round the wings. The female is a pretty Insect, but is more inclined to brown throughout than the male.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="101"/>This species has been supposed to feed on grass in the larva state, but as collectors have very rarely reared it from that state, it has been difficult to determine its proper food. Fabricius mentions lettuce and scabious or devil's-bit. The larva is hairy, and in many respects very much resembles that of the Garden Tiger Moth, from which we may perhaps infer that it is a general feeder.</P>
<P>We found the larva in May; shortly after it spun a web and passed into the pupa state, from which the moth was produced the 11th of June following.</P>

<P>The synonyms sufficiently denote the unsettled opinion of eminent naturalists in respect of the proper genus to which our Insect should be referred. We have followed the definition of Linnaeus, because
<PB N="84" REF="104"/>
it appears to us more characteristic of the creature, which should have a lengthened articulated tail, terminated in a sharp crooked sting, to warrant us in placing it among the Scorpions. In the system of Fabricius this forms no part of his generical character, but those who are accustomed to depend only on the writings of Linnaeus, would be perplexed to reconcile the apparent difference between the Phalangia of that author, and the Scorpio of Fabricius.</P>
<P>The general appearance of this creature, except the want of tail, is precisely that of a Scorpion in miniature.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams, in his Essay on the Microscope, has figured and de∣scribed a new species of this genus; it is smaller, and differs in form from our present species: he calls it the Lobster Insect. We believe Phalangium Cancroides is the largest Insect of the genus found in England that resembles a Scorpion.</P>
<P>This Insect is sometimes found in the covers of old books, in rotten wood, and other damp and decayed substances. We once found it fastened on the body of the <HI>Musca Vomitoria,</HI> Common Flesh Fly, from which it could not be extricated without killing and tear∣ing the fly into pieces.</P>
<P>Roesel has given a figure of it, and represented a parcel of its eggs. They are of an oblong form, colour greenish, and appear to be deposited in roundish clusters of about thirty or forty eggs in each.</P>
<P>The natural size of our Insect is represented at Fig 1.</P>

<P>The Caterpillar of this Insect is generally found under the bark of the willow and sallow, or on the rose. It is probable there are two broods of it in the year, being sometimes taken in the winged state early in the summer, but more commonly in the month of October; this is the more likely, as the English Aurelians first called it the Herald, from an idea that its appearance warned them of ap∣proaching winter.</P>
<P>This Insect remains about twenty-eight days in the pupa state, the Caterpillar not being found till the beginning of September.</P>
