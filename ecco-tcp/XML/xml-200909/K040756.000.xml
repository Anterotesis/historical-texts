<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many unpleasing cir∣cumstances attending the
concealed writer of a dramatic piece (and they are more than are apt at first
to occur to him), it is not one of the least considerable to a liberal
mind, that other persons become sufferers by his failings. Thus while the
real Author, on one hand, has enjoyed the compliment of having the Lord of the
Manor ascribed to se∣veral men, for whom it is great literary cre∣dit to be
mistaken; so, on the other, he has had the pain to see criticism
extended from poetical to political principles, and made a vehicle for party
reflections upon persons who never saw a line of his writing. Not only have
the erroneous guesses shifted from man to man, they have fallen also
upon men in a body: different scenes have been given to dif∣ferent pens; and
sometimes these supposed writers have multiplied upon the imagina∣tion,
'till they became almost as numerous as the personages of the drama.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="3"/>Perhaps an apology may be due to every man who
has been charged with this found∣ling; and the more especially as the parent
himself means to continue still unknown—confessing ingenuously
at the same time, that his temptations to break from his con∣cealment far
over-balance his discourage∣ments: for after duly weighing every de∣fect of
fable, conduct, dialogue, &amp;c. with which the severest critic could tax
him, what candidate for praise in poetry would not bear the weight ten-fold,
for the sole pride of avowing in his own name the songs which by many
respectable judges have been attri∣buted to Mr. SHERIDAN?</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to trouble the reader with the motives upon
which so flattering a gra∣tification is resisted.—Some of them
perhaps are mere peculiarities of temper—Suffice it to say, that they
are such, upon the whole, as induce this Author to request the few friends,
who necessarily have been entrusted with his secret, not to think
themselves at liberty, from any thing here said, to divulge it. For his own
part he is desirous so far to satisfy the public curiosity (if
curiosity re∣mains upon so trifling a subject) as to declare that every
word in the following Opera is the production of a single person; and
should a mistake still rest upon any individual, it is
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/> fit that the burthen should be made as light as
possible, by removing some prejudices which have been bevelled unjustly
against the <HI>man,</HI> whatever may become of others which may have been
conceived against the <HI>piece.</HI></P>
<P>Be it known, then, that these scenes were written last
summer in the country for mere amusement—to relax a mind which had
been engaged in more intense application—and the only view in bringing
them upon the stage was a continuation of amusement, encou∣raged and
enhanced by the reflection, that, if they were defective in many parts, they
were harmless in all; that although they might not correct the follies, they
would not offend the morals of the spectators.</P>
<P>It could not but be matter of surprise and some pain to a
writer intent upon these prin∣ciples, to find himself accused of having
in∣troduced the character of Captain Trepan, for the purpose of impeding the
recruiting ser∣vice of the army. To be thought a bad Poet, is but a common
misfortune, and it may be borne with temper and in silence; but the
imputation of being an ill-intention∣ed citizen requires an answer, though in
this case, it is trusted, a short one will suffice.</P>
<P>The writer has ever conceived, that as to shew the enormous
vices of the time in their <PB N="viii" REF="5"/> utmost deformity ought to be
the great end of dramatic satire; so, in a lesser degree, to ex∣pose
to ridicule any practice that savoured more of abuse than absolute vice,
had its use. They who think the fallacies and frauds of recruiting dealers
about this town necessary evils, which ought to be connived at, as
contributary to the military strength of the nation, are ignorant of facts,
or blind to con∣sequences. So little is the writer of that opinion, that he
has thought it incumbent upon him to restore in print the passages which
from apprehension of sudden miscon∣structions, and from no other
apprehension, were omitted in the representation. An abler hand might have
carried satire on this subject infinitely further, not only with a
consciousness of doing no harm, but also a confidence of doing good.
Let us suppose, for illustration-sake, that his Majesty were
pleased to command the First Part of King Henry IV. and to order all the
boxes to be kept for the new Commanders, which the policy of the times (from
the scarcity un∣doubtedly of veterans) has placed at the head of corps
raising or to be raised; and one of the galleries devoted exclusively to
the Crimp Cap∣tains and their Subalterns—might not public benefit be
united with entertainment by a just exhibition of old Jack Falstaff's
levies? and <PB N="ix" REF="6"/> should it happen that any person present
in such an audience were conscious of
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>having misused the King's press
damnably</HI>"</Q>—or from any other cause were
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>ashamed of his
raga∣muffins</HI>"</Q>—surely he could not but feel grate∣ful for so
gentle a hint! and we might see effected by wit and mirth, a reformation,
which under a harsh Sovereign might have been thought deserving of direct
and exem∣plary reprehension.</P>
<P>A more serious defence can hardly be re∣quisite upon this
subject, after publication of the piece. At the Theatre, where the atten∣tion
naturally (and in this instance most de∣servedly) has rested much upon
the music, the public sentiments sincerely meant to be inculcated may
have escaped notice; but, in the closet, the writer, without a shadow of
fear, rests his justification from the charge of ill-will to the military
service, upon passages too numerous to be pointed out. He might almost
say upon every character of the Drama—but particularly upon that of
Tru∣more, where the two extremes of that pas∣sion which fills, or ought to
fill, every youthful breast, is employed to excite mar∣tial ardour: in one
instance, <HI>disappointment</HI> and <HI>despondency</HI> in love are
made the motives for enlisting as a private soldier; in the other,
<HI>success</HI> in love, the supreme happiness <PB N="x" REF="7"/> in
human existence, is not admitted as an excuse for relinquishing the
military service during the exigencies of our country.</P>
<P>To disavow the aspersion I have men∣tioned, was the
principal purpose of this ad∣dress to the candour of the reader; but
hav∣ing taken up the pen, I will venture to offer to his further indulgence a
few thoughts upon Opera, and particularly that species of it attempted in the
ensuing pages.</P>
<P>The Opera is a favourite entertainment in all the polite countries
of Europe, but in none, that I know of, held subject to the laws of regular
Drama. There is neither usage nor statute of criticism (if I may use
that expres∣sion) to try it by, unless we look for such in some
musical code. Metastasio, though a very respectable stage writer, has
never been brought to the same bar with Corneille or Racine, or any other
professors of correct Tragedy. The vital principle and very soul of
Italian Opera is music; and provided it be well maintained in composition
and execu∣tion, every inconsistency, in fable, conduct, or character, is
not only always pardoned, but often applauded.</P>
<P>The French Opera (without entering into the disputed points
concerning its music, or denying the many beautiful passages which may be
extracted from its poetry) is if possible <PB N="xi" REF="8"/> more absurd
than the Italian in its departure from probability. To the powers of sound is
added all that decoration, machinery, beauty, and grace, can supply to
enchant the eye and the fancy; and so forcible, it must be al∣lowed, is
their effect, that the judgement re∣ceives no shock, when tyrants and lovers,
heroes and peasants, Gods and devils, are singing and dancing in amicable
chorus all together.</P>
<P>The reader will go with me in applying every thing yet said to
the serious or great Opera. Another species, but no more of the legitimate
family of Comedy than the for∣mer is of Tragedy, has been introduced in all the
countries I have alluded to. In Eng∣land both have been in use in our native
language, but with very different success. I have no hesitation in
pronouncing an opi∣nion, that the adopting what is called reci∣tative into a
language, to which it is totally incongruous, is the cause of failure in an
English serious Opera much oftener than the want of musical powers in the
performers. In countries where the inflection of voice in recitative upon the
stage is little more than what the ear is used to in common discourse,
the dialogue of the drama is sustained and strengthened by a great
compass of tones; but in our northern climates, in proportion
<PB N="xii" REF="9"/> as the ordinary expression comes nearer mo∣notony,
recitative, or musical dialogue, will seem the more preposterous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Addison upon this subject, Spectator N<SUP>o</SUP>. 29,
and others of his papers upon the Opera.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I will not contend (though I have my doubts) that it is
impossible for genius to in∣vent, and for voice to deliver, a sort of
reci∣tative that the English language will bear. But it must be widely
different from the Ita∣lian. If any specimens can yet be produced of it's
having been effected, they will be found to consist only of a few lines
introductive of the air which is to follow, and as such re∣ceived by the ear
just as symphony would be. Very few serious pieces, except Artaxerxes,
can be recollected upon our Theatre where it has not entirely failed, even when
assisted by action: in Oratorios it is, with a few ex∣ceptions, and
those sustained by accompani∣ment, a soporific that even the thunder of
Handel's chorusses are hardly loud enough to overcome.</P>
<P>There may be enthusiasts in music who will treat the
disrelish I have described to want of ear. Let ear be understood merely
as the organ by which the mind is to receive more or less delight from
sublime English verse, and I should be happy to see the dis∣pute
brought to public issue—the test should be the performance of
Alexander's Feast as <PB N="xiii" REF="10"/> now set to music throughout;
and the per∣formance of that inimitable ode, with the songs alone preserved
in music, and the rest delivered by Mrs. Yates without accompa∣niment, or
other melody, than her empha∣tic elocution.</P>
<P>I trust that in contending against musical dialogue in
English, I shall not be under∣stood to think that all music is
inapplicable to the higher compositions of our stage. On the contrary I am
convinced that under judicious management music is capable of giving them
effect beyond what our best au∣thors can attain without it—music can
add energy to Shakspeare himself. Indignant as an English audience would
be to hear King Lear deliver himself in recitative, I believe no person,
who had a heart or taste, ever contemplated the mute groupe of Cordelia with
the aged parent asleep in her lap, and the physician watching by, without
an en∣crease of sensibility from the soft music which Mr. Garrick
introduced into that scene. The same observation will hold good with
respect to the additional horror excited in Macbeth, and delight in the
Tempest, from the judicious use of both song and in∣struments. I cannot
help quoting another instance of the application of music which I have
always thought a happy one. At the close of the tragedy of the Gamester,
when <PB N="xiv" REF="11"/> the distress is raised to such a pitch that
lan∣guage fails under it, how forcibly is the im∣pression left upon the
audience by music, accompanying the slow descent of the cur∣tain over the
mournful picture! How pre∣ferable such a conclusion to the usual one of
an actor straddling over dead bodies to deliver a tame moral in tame rhime to
the pit, in the same breath, and often in the same tone, in which he is to
give out the play. But surely no man can be so void of discernment as not
to see clearly the difference between recitative and music thus applied:
the one diverts the attention from sense to sound, breaks the propriety
and very nerve of our language, and by giving to the expression of the
passions cadences of which we never heard an example, nor can form a
concep∣tion in real life, destroys that delusion and charm of fancy which
makes the situations before us our own, and is the essence of dra∣matic
representation: the other, upon the principle of the chorus of the antients,
serves to excite and to combine attention and emo∣tion, and to improve and to
continue upon the mind the impressions most worthy to be retained.</P>
<P>I am aware that I have entered further into the grave Drama than
my subject re∣quired; but the digression will be found ex∣cusable, in
as much as the same doctrine ap∣plies <PB N="xv" REF="12"/> to comic
productions, and as it will serve to shorten the trouble of the reader in
what I have further to offer.</P>
<P>One branch of comic opera which meets with success on our
stage is evidently a graft from the Burletta of the Italians; and little as I
may admire it in general, I will venture to say, respectively to the
writing, it is im∣proved in our soil. Midas, the Golden Pippin, and some
others, considered as pieces of parody and burlesque, are much better than
any Italian Burletta I know. In fact, there is in general in the Italian Drama
of this name an insipidity, mixed with a buffoonery too low to be called
farci∣cal, which would make the representation insupportable in England,
were the language understood, or attended to in any other view than as the
introduction and display of ex∣quisite music.</P>
<P>I cannot easily bring myself to allow the higher branch of our
Comic Opera, to be of foreign extraction. From the time the Beg∣gar's Opera
appeared, we find pieces in prose, with songs interspersed, so
approaching to regular Comedy in plot, incident, and pre∣servation of
character, as to make them a di∣stinct species from any thing we find
abroad—and is it too much to add that the sense, wit, and humour to
be found in some of them are sterling English marks by which we
<PB N="xvi" REF="13"/> may claim the species as our own? The mu∣sical pieces
at Paris, upon the Theatre called <HI>Les Italiens,</HI> sprung up from the
decline of a sort of Drama where half the personages were Italian, as was
half the language. When Harlequin and Argentine grew un∣fashionable, such
other representations as served best for an hour of mere dissipation
succeeded, and the light and easy music with which they were accompanied,
made them very popular. But the pieces are either pa∣rodies, or founded in
general upon materials which would be thought in England too flimzy for any
thing but an after-piece. They are composed with an amusing playful∣ness
of imagination, which runs Love thro' all its divisions, and usually
contain abun∣dance of very pretty vocal music with a scar∣city of incident
and little variety of charac∣ter. It is not intended to degrade or depre∣ciate
this stile of writing as applicable to a Paris audience: it is only meant to
state it more widely separate and distinct from the force and spirit of
regular comedy than our own. They who are unacquainted with the Paris theatre,
are referred for judgement upon this subject to the Deserter, Zemira and
Azor, and other direct translations; and to Daphne and Amintor, and Thomas
and Sally, and other after-pieces, very good in their kind, but written after
the French man∣ner. <PB N="xvii" REF="14"/> The Padlock is above this class in
dis∣play of characters; and the French have no∣thing upon their Musical
Comic Stage to compare, as resembling <HI>Comedy,</HI> with Love in a
Village, or the Maid of the Mill, or, to take still greater credit to our
Theatre, the Duenna.</P>
<P>The Lord of the Manor, although the leading incident of the
story is professedly taken from the Silvain of Marmontel, is an humble
attempt at the species of Opera which I have ventured to call English, and
to de∣scribe as a drama the next in gradation below regular Comedy, and which
might perhaps be carried a step above it. It will not there∣fore be thought
want of attention to the ex∣cellencies of Marmontel's piece, which as adapted
to French manners I believe no man of taste will dispute, but respect and
prefer∣ence to our stage, that induced me to alter and enlarge the plan and
conduct of the original, to substitute characters, and to add scenes and
circumstances entirely new.</P>
<P>I know not a feature of character pre∣served from Marmontel,
except the sensibi∣lity and artless innocence of the young
wo∣men—qualities, which, to be truly repre∣sented, admit of little
diversity by change of country.</P>
<P>I should be sorry if taking part, or even the whole of a
story from a foreign stage, when <PB N="xviii" REF="15"/> such story can
be made applicable to our cus∣toms and characters, and is entirely new worked
up for that purpose, could be deemed plagiarism, because it would be a
confine∣ment to the invention rather pedantick than useful.</P>
<P>But while I am taking credit for borrow∣ing so little as one
incident, there may be those who think I had better have borrowed a great
deal more. I can only say that translation, or imitation, would have cost
less pains, as it is easier to spin
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Filer le Sentiment.</NOTE> sentiment,
than to delineate character, and to write twenty songs to please the ear,
than half as many lines of such Comedy as ought to satisfy the judgement. I
do not contend that a direct copy of Marmontel would not have been a much
better thing than my talents have been able to make; I only insist it would
no have been English drama. Continued uninterrupt∣ed scenes of tenderness
and sensibility <HI>(Comedie larmoyante)</HI> may please the very
refined, but the bulk of an English audience, including many of the best
understanding, go to a comic performance to laugh in some part of it at
least. They claim a right to do so upon precedents of our most valued
plays—and every author owes it to them, so long as the merriest
amongst them shews he is equal∣ly <PB N="xix" REF="16"/> capable of
relishing and applauding what is elevated and affecting—an
observation I have always seen hold good in an English gallery.</P>
<P>It might be assuming too much to quote any passages from
the Lord of the Manor, as a test that every part of the house can re∣lish
refined sentiment; but were the fact ten times more apparent, I should
still adhere to my former opinion, and intermix mirth: the censure of a
critic of fashion here and there in the boxes, who reckon every thing low
which is out of their own sphere, would never persuade me to turn Moll
Flagon out of my piece (easy as it would be to conduct the story without
her) while she excites so much pleasure in general, as to prove the
character can neither be false in nature, nor void of humour.</P>
<P>And now a few words upon what I con∣ceive would be the plan of
writing, were men of genius and taste to try a specimen of correct
musical comedy.</P>
<P>In a representation which is to hold
<Q REND="inline">"a mirror up to nature,"</Q> and which ought to
draw its chief applause from reason, vocal music should be confined to
express the feel∣ings of the passions, but never to express the
exercise of them. Song, in any action in which reason tells us it would be
unnatural to sing, must be preposterous. To fight a duel, to cudgel a
poltroon in cadence, may <PB N="xx" REF="17"/> be borne in a burletta, upon the
same prin∣ciple that in the serious opera we see heroes fight lions and
monsters, and sometimes ut∣ter their last struggles for life in song,
and die in strict time and tune: but these liber∣ties would be totally
inadmissible in the kind of drama which I am recommending. My idea might be
further explained by a passage in the piece of Marmontel before re∣ferred
to. It appeared to one of the news∣paper critics, that I had been guilty of a
great error in not introducing a scene in the Silvain, wherein the <HI>Gardes
Chasse</HI> of the Seigneur attack the sportsman with guns in their
hands, threatening to shoot him un∣less he surrenders his gun which he
persists in preserving. By the bye, this sort of au∣thority is more
natural in France than I hope it would <HI>yet</HI> be thought to be in
Eng∣land: but that was not my principal objec∣tion. This scene upon the
French stage is all in song; and even at Paris, where licence of throwing
action into song is so much more in use than it is here, and where I have
often seen it excellently performed, the idea of five or six fellows with
fusils present∣ed at a gentleman's head, and their fingers upon the
triggers, threatening his life in bass notes, he resisting in tenor, and
a wife or daughter throwing herself between them in treble, while the
spectator is kept in sus∣pence, <PB N="xxi" REF="18"/> from what in
reality must be a mo∣mentary event, till the composer has run his air
through all its different branches, and to a great length, always gave me
disgust to a great degree.</P>
<P>Music, therefore, if employed to express action, must be
confined to dumb shew. It is the very essence of pantomime; and we have
lately seen upon the opera stage how well a whole story may be told in
dance; but in all these instances music stands in the place of
speech, and is itself the only organ to express the sentiments of the
actor.</P>
<P>To return to the application of vocal music upon the English
theatre: it must not only be restrained from having part in the exer∣cise
or action of the passions; care must be also taken, that it does not
interrupt or de∣lay events for the issue of which the mind is become eager.
It should always be the <HI>accessory</HI> and not the <HI>principal</HI>
subject of the drama; but at the same time spring out of it in such a
manner that the difference can hardly be discerned, and that it should
seem neither the one nor the other could be spared.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding all these restrictions, vocal music
judiciously managed would have many occasions to distinguish its own
specific charms, at the same time that it embellish∣ed,
<PB N="xxii" REF="19"/> enriched, and elevated regular dramatic compositions.
In tragedy, I am convinced, the mind would peculiarly feel its powers.
<Q><L>Not touch'd but rapt, not waken'd but inspir'd.</L></Q> In
the humbler, but not less instructive line of comedy, its office would be
to convey through the sweetest channel, and to esta∣blish by the most
powerful impressions upon the mind, maxim, admonition, sentiment,
virtue.</P>
<P>Should any thing I have said strike a man of genius and
taste with the distinction I have endeavoured to establish between
comic opera and musical comedy, viz. between
<Q REND="inline">"elaborate trifles"</Q> made secondary to
music, and sense and spirit inculcated and sustained by it, new
subjects could not be wanting to engage their trials; or if it occurred to
men of that description to try an experiment upon an old subject, and a
poet could be found courageous enough to engraft upon Shakspeare, as has been
done upon Milton in Comus; perhaps no subject could be found in the whole
range of fancy better fitted for musical comedy than the play of "As you like
it." Indeed it seems by some songs thrown into the original, that it was
the idea of the great author himself. To multiply the <PB N="xxiii" REF="20"/>
songs, excellent materials might be taken from the piece itself, without
injury to the eloquent and brilliant passages which are better adapt∣ed to
the energy of elocution and action. And where materials failed in the original,
what true votary of the Muse would not find animation, and assistance
in his inven∣tive faculties, from the prospect of being ad∣mitted before the
public a companion to Shakspeare!</P>
<P>In the mean time the Lord of the Manor has been offered, not as an
example, but an excitement to improve that species of drama—
<Q><L>—fungar vice cotis; acutum</L>
<L>Reddere quae ferrum valet, exsors ipse secandi.</L></Q>
It would be affectation in me, as well as in∣gratitude to the public, to deny
the pleasure I have had in the very favourable reception of this piece. At
the same time I trust that I am duly sensible how much of the
success is to be attributed to the exertions of the performers, the merits
of the Orchestra, and the excellence of Mr. Jackson's composition. Among
all the circumstances of satisfaction, there is not one more pleasing to
the reflec∣tion than that the bringing this humble pro∣duction upon the
stage, has been the means of making me acquainted with a man whose
<PB N="xxiv" REF="21"/> harmony I sincerely believe to be character∣istic of
his mind,—equal to any exertions, but peculiarly exquisite; when
expressive of the social, tender, quiet, and amiable quali∣ties of the
human heart.</P>
<P>Before I dismiss this theatrical subject, up∣on which I have
hazarded many opinions that for aught I know may be singly mine, I am free to
confess, that in calling upon men of genius to try the effect of my ideas, I
have had my eye particularly upon Mr. Sheridan. As an author, he is above my
en∣comium; as a friend, it is my pride to think we are exactly upon a level.
From the consideration of him in both those capacities, I feel myself
more interested than the rest of the world, in a performance he has some
time given us reason to expect. His Muse, though without participation of
my cause, will naturally and of necessity be the advo∣cate of it, by
verifying and exemplifying true musical comedy; and such a sanction from
the author whom all respect, will be rendered doubly precious to myself by
its proceeding also from the man I love.</P>

<STAGE>At the close of the overture a peal of bells is heard at a
distance, the curtain continuing down. When the peal is nearly finished the
curtain rises, and discovers a mag∣nificent entrance to a park, with a view
of a Gothic castle on an eminence at a distance. On the side scene,
near the park-gate, the outside of a small neat farm∣house with a bank of
turf before the door, on which <HI>Sophia</HI> and <HI>Annette</HI> are
seated and at work—<HI>An∣nette</HI> throws down her work, and runs to

<P>Wake! An hundred wakes together would not make such a day as
this is like to be. Our new land∣lord, that has bought all this great estate
of Castle Ma∣nor, is arrived; and Rental the steward, who went up to London
upon the purchase, is with him, and is to be continued steward. He has been
presenting the tenants—and they are still flocking up to the castle
to get a sight of Sir John,—Sir John—</P>

<P>And how is it ever to end? The two fathers are specially
circumstanced to make a family alliance. A curate with forty pounds a year
has endow'd his son with two sure qualities to entail his poverty, Learning
and Modesty; and our gentleman (my master, God bless him!) is
possessed of this mansion, a farm of an hundred acres, a gun and a
brace of spaniels—I should have thought the example so long before
your eyes of living upon love might have made you—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a notion I cannot bear. I speak my mind familiarly to

it as sure as the gypsies in every turn of your countenance.—Read

<P>No nonsense, but a plain road to fortune. Our young
landlord, Sir John Contrast's son, is expected every hour; now get but your
silly passion for Trumore out of your head, and my life on't it will
do—I dreamt last night I saw you with a bunch of nettles in your
breast for a nosegay; and that's a sure sign of a wed∣ding—Let us

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, my friend, how did you describe me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>As what I always found you—an honest man. One can go no
farther than that word in praise of a cha∣racter; therefore, to make him the
better acquainted with yours, I was forced to tell him the worst I knew of
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Rental, what might that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him, you had the benevolence of a prince, with means
little better than a cottager; that conse∣quently your family was often
indebted to your gun (at which you were the best hand in the country) for the
only meat in your kitchen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what said he to the gun?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>He shook his head, and said, if you were a poacher, woe be
to you when his son arrived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>His son!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, his only son in fact. The eldest it seems was turned
out of doors twenty years ago, for a mar∣riage against his consent. This is
by a second wife, and declared his heir. He gives him full rein to run his
own course, so he does not marry—and by all accounts a fine rate he
goes at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is become of that elder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody knows. But the old servants who remem∣ber him are
always lamenting the change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know him well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A discovery that will surprize you—I have lived with
you, the many years we have been acquainted—an intimate—a
friend—and an impostor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>An impostor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your new master, the purchaser of this estate is an
obstinate father—I am a disinherited son—put those
<PB N="10" REF="33"/> circumstances together, and instead of Rashly, call
me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call me Contrast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Rashly, Sir John Contrast's son!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so—for the sole offence of a marriage with the
most amiable of womankind, I received one of Sir John's rescripts as he
calls the signification of his plea∣sure, with a note of a thousand
pounds, and a prohi∣bition of his presence for ever. I knew his temper too
well to reply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know him best—I had conceived him of a
disposition more odd than harsh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right; but this oddity has all the effects of
harshness. Sir John Contrast has ever thought deci∣sion to be the
criterion of wisdom; and is as much averse to retract an error as a right
action. In short, in his character, there is a continual variance between a
good heart and a perverse head; and he often ap∣pears angry with all mankind,
when in fact he is only out of humour with himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="34"/>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always thought you must have been bred above the station I
saw you in, but I never guessed how much—could you immediately
submit to such a change of situation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I thought of different professions to support the rank
of a gentleman. I afterwards placed my eldest daughter, then an infant, under
the care of a relation, and went abroad—There my Annette was born, and
for the sake of oeconomy for some years educated. In short, after various
trials, I found I wanted supple∣ness for some of my pursuits, and
talents perhaps for others; and my last resource was a cottage and love, in
the most literal sense of both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why did you change your name?—the pride of Sir John
Contrast would never have suffered it to be said, that his son was in
the capacity of a poor far∣mer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our claims were upon the <HI>virtues,</HI> not the
weak∣nesses of the heart; and when <HI>they</HI> failed, obscurity was
not only choice but prudence. Why give our children the name and knowledge of a
rank that might alienate their minds from the humble life to which they were
destined?</P>

<P> The manors are poached to desolation, the saddles are

<SP>

<P>A tenant upon this estate these sixteen years, where I

servility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odd language for a farmer!—but in plain English it

what may be your occupation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been long, sir, steward at Castle Manor; your
father's goodness continues me so. I'm sorry, sir, you have had no
sport—but your game-keepers are strangers—if this gentleman had
been with you, he knows every haunt of the country.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is your qualification?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my birth-right as a free man—Nature gave the birds of
the air in common to us all; and I think it no crime to pursue them, when my
heart tells me I am ready, if called upon, to exercise the same gun
against the enemies of my king and country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A period again! if it were not for his dress I should take
him for a strolling orator escaped from Soho—but to cut the dispute
short—You Mr. Steward, and you Mr. Monitor of the forest, take notice
that I require unconditional submission in my supremacy of the

<SPEAKER>RENTAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what manner, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The county gaol shall teach transgressors—thanks
to my fellow sportsmen in the senate, we have as good a system of
game laws as can be found in the most gentleman-like country upon the
continent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P> "By gentleman-like I am afraid, young sir, you mean
arbitrary—It is true we have such laws—mo∣dern and unnatural
excrescences, which have grown and strengthened by insensible degrees,
'till they lie upon our statute-book like a wen upon a fair pro∣portion'd
body—a deformity fed by wholesome juices.—I hope, sir, we
shall have your assistance to remove the evil."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P> "Just the contrary. Tho' our system be excellent for the
preservation of game, it still wants a little foreign enforcement—In
France, the insignia of a Lord Paramont of the chace are gallowses with his
arms upon every hill in his estate—they embellish a prospect better
than the finest clump Brown ever planted." You look at me with surprize,
old re∣former of the groves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I do, sir! In days when I frequented the world, a
high-bred town spark and a sportsman were <PB N="23" REF="46"/> the
greatest opposites in nature—The bean and the squire were
always—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I begin to take you—your days—the rusticat∣ed
remains of a ruined Temple Critic—a smatterer of high life from the
scenes of Cibber, which remain up∣on his imagination, as they do upon the

gentleman are as obsolete, old speculator, as the flaxen wig, and "stap
my vitals."</P>

<P>Coxcombs—never baulk the word—the first thing in
which we differ from your days is, that we glory in our title, and I am the

the head of a class.</P>

<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith; and we diminish every day; the cockade
predominates—the times have set nine tenths of our men of fashion
upon being their own soldiers—I shou'd as soon have thought of
being my own gun∣smith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it possible you can have been idle at such

<P>Right for once, old Tramontane—singularity is the

with orgeat and icid lemonade.</P>

<STAGE>A Shrubbery.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Sophia</HI> and <HI>Annette,</HI> arm in
arm.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Confess, Annette, you are a very forward scholar in
affairs of the heart: but would you really per∣suade me, that the women in
France scorn to be in love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just the contrary. Love, there, is the passion of all
ages. One learns to lisp it in the cradle; and they will trifle with it at
the brink of the grave; but it is always the cherup of life, not the moping
malady, as it is here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And according to the notions of that fantastical people, how
is the passion to be shewn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! in a woman, by any thing but confessing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Annette, you must now be wrong: insin∣cerity and
artifice may, for aught I know, be the vices <PB N="35" REF="58"/> of fine folks
in courts and cities; but in the rural scenes, where you as well as myself
have been bred, I am persuaded the tongue and the heart go together in all
countries alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they may too: it would be wrong if the tongue told fibs of
the heart; but what occasion for telling <HI>all</HI> the truth?—I
wish you saw a girl in Provence as she trips down the mountain with a
basket of grapes upon her head, and all her swains about her, with a glance
at one, and a nod at another, and a tap to a third—'till up rises the
moon, and up strikes the tabor and pipe—away go the
baskets—"<HI>Adieu panniers, Ven∣dange est faite!</HI>"—her
heart dances faster than her feet, and she makes ten lads happy instead
of one, by each thinking himself the favourite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the real favourite is not to be in suspence for
ever?</P>

<SPEAKER>ANNETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; she solves the mystery at last, but in a lively
key.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>("A short French song.")</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire your vivacity, Annette; but I dislike your maxims.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! but you are mistaken—I understand sentiment
perfectly, and could act it to admiration. I cou'd gaze at the moon, prattle to
the evening breeze, and make a companion of a rose for hours

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fye child—the first thing you do must be to correct
that frown and this coyness—they have no more to do with thy figure
than a red cloak or blue stockings—No, no, my girl, learn to look a man
in the face, whatever he says to you—it is one of the first
principles for high life; and high as the very pinnacle of female ambition
shall thine be—thou shalt drive four poneys with a postilion no

<P>Clarissa Harlow in her altitudes!—what circulating

has your antiquated father in∣structed you, as he has me, in the mode of his

<P>A mob to encounter thee!—a mob of fleas—of
gnats—of pismires—a wasp would be a sure

your be∣haviour calls for chastisement, the meanness of it places you

<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>For heaven's sake, Trumore, be not violent, you make me
tremble—no further quarrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another word, Sir, and no more—could I suppose you a
real sample of our fashionable youth, I should think my country
<HI>indeed</HI> degraded—but it cannot be—away!—and tell
your few fellows, if even few exist, that there is still spirit enough
among <HI>common</HI> <PB N="42" REF="65"/> people to defend beauty and
innocence; and when such as you dare affronts like these, it is not rank
nor estate, nor even effeminacy, that shall save them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very sententious truly—quite Rashly's
flourish.—In Italy now I could have this fellow put under ground for a
sequin—in this damned country, we can do nothing but despise him.

<P>Just where I ought to be by the true rule of a valet de

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall not need till she is brought to proper terms. Look
ye, sir, Peggy the maid is a fly wench, why not make her a convenient
one?—Commission me to pay her price, and she shall deliver this
toy into your hands—that's love exactly in your own way, you know.</P>

<P>I would not give five pounds for her, if it were not for
vengeance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your vengeance need not stop there. The father you know, by
his own confession, is a poacher. I have enquired of Peggy if he has no
enemies—he has but one it seems in the parish; but he is worth a
hundred—an attorney—broken by Rashly's faculty in deciding
differences—this fellow shall saddle him with as many actions for
game in half an hour, as shall send him to jail, perhaps for the rest of
his days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your plan is not unpromising, and you may try one of my
<HI>rouleaus</HI> upon it.—If I could at the same time correct the dog

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF you offer to be impudent again, you shall have it on both
ears instead of one. I tell you I'm a married woman; is not that an
answer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, of encouragement, my dear—it seldom is an objection
in the world I have inhabited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world is at a fine pass by your account—"But these
are some of your outlandish notions—they wou'd make fine cutting of
throats among English husbands.</P>

<STAGE>(laughing).</STAGE>
<P> "Cutting throats! Oh, my sweet Peg, how igno∣rant you are! I
wish your husband was at home with all my heart—I'd shew you how to
follow the example of our betters—I wou'd dine with you both every day,

<P>Oh my dear, you need be in no pain about that. She is not in the
least danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, did not you tell me your master was mad in love for her,
and wou'd make my fortune if I wou'd help him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly! but what has that to do with marriage?</P>

<SPEAKER>PEGGY</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(in surprize).</STAGE>
<P> What the deuce has it to do with else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pleasure and profit. He'll love her out of vanity if she
makes a figure as his mistress; he'd hate her for fashion's sake if
she was his wife. Let us but get the couple well established in
London—who knows but you and I may be exalted to be their toads.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Toads!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>One takes any name for a fortune, and this is be∣come a
fashionable one I assure you. In short you <PB N="61" REF="84"/> will be
the companion of her pleasures; dress'd as well as herself; courted by
every man who has a de∣sign upon her—and make a market of her every
day. Oh, you'll have quite the pull of me in employment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I shall change damnably for the worse in quitting the
life of a valet for that of a companion. "Follower to what he calls a man of
fashion! zounds I'd rather be a bailiff's follower by half—if it was
not for what may come after.</P>

is, escaped from shar∣pers and creditors, to purchase beauty and
kindness.</P>

your sex wou'd require so much time.</P>

<STAGE>(to herself).</STAGE>
<P> No means of fitting the rogue! Gad I have a thought—if I
am not too much in a passion to dissem∣ble—I am not much used
to artifice—but they say it never fails a woman at a pinch.</P>

now tell me fairly what am I to do for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="63" REF="86"/>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but an office of good-nature—you are to put your
mistress into my master's hands—you wo∣men can do more with one
another in this sort of business in a day, then a lover (at least
such a one as ours) will do in a year.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye, what names you are giving things again!—you are to
remove foolish prejudices; to open a friend's eyes to their
interest—zounds child it's an office for a statesman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that's all—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not quite all; you know there's a something that regards
ourselves, but that goes of course in nego∣ciations of this sort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, does it?—and what do you call this pretty
in∣vention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LA NIPPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An abridgement of polite arithmetic—a purse must be
counted, which is troublesome; a note requires <PB N="64" REF="87"/> reading,
which to some persons may be inconvenient—but the <HI>rouleau</HI>
conveys fifty guineas to your pocket without a single chink, and takes up
less room than a toothpick case.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEGGY.</SPEAKER>

<P>From the bottom of a black ditch—how I got there I know no

<SPEAKER>TRUMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have none, Sir—they aspired too high when di∣rected to
Sophy Rashly; they must cease for ever when I think of Miss
Contrast.</P>

<P>So far from it, Sir, that I think the purity of his attachment

fortune of the <HI>heiress.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confirm the decree—it is exactly my old way—I have
not been apt to retract an action, but no man more ready to correct it by doing
the reverse another time. I am now convinced mutual affection makes the only
true equality in marriage; and in my present humour (I don't know how long
'twill last) I wish there was not a wedding in the nation formed upon any
other interest—what say you, man of fashion?</P>

<P>Dear Sir, don't treat my brother's foibles too se∣verely. His
zeal, to be eminent, only wants a right turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him find that turn, and he knows I have where-withal to keep
him from the inconvenience of a younger brother, though he loses Castle
Manor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONTRAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I resign it, and all its appendages. And with all my faults,
my brother shall find I am neither envious nor mercenary.</P>
<P><STAGE>[To <HI>La Nippe.</HI>]</STAGE> Horses for town
instantly; there is my true sphere—and if ever I am caught in a rural

sheep-biting, and but<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed into a

<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now to return to my recruit—I promised he should
be attested to-night—and so he shall—to his
<PB N="94" REF="117"/> bride—if afterwards his country demands his
assistance—get him a commission, Sophy, and pray for a short
end to the war—a prayer in which every good subject in the nation will
join you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you have given me a possession that makes all other
treasures poor. Witness love and truth, how much I despise the
temptation of ambition, when weighed against one hour of Sophia's society.
But these are times when service to the public is a tribute that justice
and virtue indiscriminately impose upon private happiness. And the man
who refuses upon their call, a sacrifice to the exigency of his country,
ill deserves to be a sharer in her prosperity.</P>
