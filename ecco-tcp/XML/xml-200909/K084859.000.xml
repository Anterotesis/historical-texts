<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Don't question but that a Trea∣tise of this Nature will be e∣steemed by a great many at this Time (when we see such Numbers crowding into the Pulpit) to be ei∣ther a sinister or vain Attempt, and already confuted by Experience. For were the Difficulties and Dis∣couragements real, they may ima∣gine that the Effect of them would be quickly seen in the Paucity of Candidates for Holy Orders. The
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Calamities (they may plead) of those already in the Profession would give Warning to others.</P>
<P>This Observation tho' it be allow∣ed to hold good in Respect of many secular Employments and Occupa∣tions; insomuch that (when the Num∣ber of Hands exceed the Demands; or any Failure abridge the Gains, and make it impossible for a great many of those, who are concerned in any particular Craft to get a comfortable Subsistence by it) gene∣ral Clamours are presently heard, and as if even some Contagion had in∣fected it; none are willing to engage themselves, or any of their Family in it. Yet must it be confessed, that hitherto its Influence has not affect∣ed the Ministry; neither has the Church been deprived of one Pro∣fessor,
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
notwithstanding that they have had as reasonable Grounds for Com∣plaints, as any Body of Men what∣soever.</P>
<P>What this is to be imputed to, is not so easy to determine. I shall seek out no other Solution of this Matter, but what a very learned Man has given us,</P>
<P><Q>While, says he, I resided at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and saw such a Conflux of Youth to their annual Admissions; I have often studied and admired, why their Parents would under such mean Encouragements design their Sons for the Church; and those the most towardly and capa∣ble and select Genius's among their Children, who must needs have emerg'd in a secular Life. I con∣gratulated indeed the Felicity of
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
your Establishment, which attrac∣ted the choice Youth of your Na∣tion for such very low Pay: but my Wonder was at the Parents, who generally have Interest, Main∣tenance, and Wealth, the first Thing in their View: Till at last one of your State Lotteries ceas'd my Astonishment. For as in that a few glittering Prizes, <HI>1.000, 5.000, 10.000</HI> Pounds among an Infinity of Blanks, drew Troops of Adventurers; who if the whole Fund had been equally ticketed out, would never have come in: So a few Dignities in your Church, Prebends, Deaneries, Bishopricks, are the pious Fraud that induces and decoys the Parents to risk their Child's Fortune in it. Every one hopes his own will get some
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
great Prize in the Church, and never reflects on the Thousands of Blanks in poor Country Livings.</Q></P>
<P>This lets us into the Mystery, and at once discovers the Reason why the Church is so fully stock'd with Di∣vines. The Parents hope and ex∣pect in a little Time to see their Chil∣dren dignified: but when (upon Try∣al) they have found their Hopes to have been fallacious, it is then that the Difficulties and Discouragements appear in their true Light; and what should have been foreseen, is by sad Experience felt.</P>
<P>To prevent the unwary from be∣ing surprized, and the Church from being burdened with those, who have no other Views, but of being sup∣ported by it, is the Design of the en∣suing Discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7"/>It is very far from my Thoughts or Purpose to degrade the Office (for which I have the greatest Reverence and Esteem) neither would I for the whole World contribute (was I able) to the detaining sufficient Num∣bers from the Service of God, and by that Means make the Church desti∣tute: Of which at present there seems to be no Danger. The Danger is ra∣ther from the reverse: For Supernu∣meraries there are at present, who might very well be spared: For whom since there is no Provision, there is therefore no Occasion for them. But now it is too late to remedy an Incon∣venience so sensibly felt by many.</P>
<P>If I could therefore be at all in∣strumental in diverting for the Time to come (by laying the Difficulties and Discouragements before them)
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
any from entering into this Sacred Office, who upon serious Reflection should be thought unable to encoun∣ter with them; If I could perswade those to seclude themselves, or ra∣ther their Friends to find out some properer Employment for them; from whom there can be little Hope or Probability of their ever being very serviceable to the Church; and if they alone would offer themselves for Admission, whose Abilities ena∣ble them to do Service, and their pious Resolutions prompt them to un∣dertake it in Spite of all the Hard∣ships they are like to meet with; If my Endeavours to effect this have but the least Success, my Intention is an∣swered; and even if they have not, I have still the private Satisfaction of Meaning well.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT VIEW OF THE DIFFICULTIES <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT will be allowed, I believe, that a more than ordinary Influence of di∣vine Grace is not expected or requi∣site as a Qualification for the being ad∣mitted into holy Orders. When any offer themselves for these, they can't with any Truth affirm, that they are moved by a∣ny stronger or more sensible Impulse of the Holy Spirit than is common to them∣selves or to any other good Men in the
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Exercise of christian Duties; nor, if they had a Mind to deceive others with it, could they gain their Belief.</P>
<P>The Inducement which they have (al∣lowing for the inward and ordinary Mo∣tion of the Holy Ghost which they trust that they have, and for some pious Reso∣lutions) is the Consequence of their Edu∣cation, and their being brought up and de∣signed for this Office, even before they themselves knew what it was.</P>
<P>Our Church is neither stock'd with mi∣raculous Gifts nor pretends to any. It suf∣fices without them, if those that desire to serve at her Altars, come recommended for Regularity of Life, and bring along with them a requisite Portion of Learning: Which latter, small as it is, however quali∣fies according to Canon; and is generally accepted of by the Governours of our Church: Tho' they have it in their Power, if they think proper, to refuse Orders with∣out giving any Reason for it. But such is the unhappy State of those, who have been all along educated for this Purpose, (and this is all too many have to plead,) that should they be rejected, it would be
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
too late to turn their Hands to any thing else; their Fortune which might have ena∣bled them to have done it, being already spent; and their Parents, Relations, and Friends being so much concerned in it, and their Hearts so much set upon it, that our Right Reverend Bishops very seldom make Use of their Authority without some legal Impediment.</P>
<P>Granting then that Orders may be some∣times had on pretty easy Terms, in Regard to the Article of Learning; and that there∣fore a Deacon is at length sprung up in the Family: Yet what mighty Prospect is there for the Youth thus barely furnished? If his Fortune is now to make, and his Title is his all, which is commonly the Case; that for the most part leads him into the Country, to some scanty obscure Curacy, just e∣nough to keep him alive; and happy is it for him that he is thrown into some solita∣ry barbarous Place, where his Audience is so well adapted to his Abilities. For here he may by weekly Labour, by plodding, and torturing and racking his Brains, squeeze out something, (whether coherent or in∣coherent, it is no Matter) which with
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
much adoe (by changing and exchanging, and the Assistance of some necessary tho' ve∣ry indifferent Helps) may be lick'd into the Model of a Thing commonly called a Ser∣mon. From hence the Congregation is to learn the Importance of Religion; and of∣tentimes because they know no better, are pleased with and applaud their Preacher; especially when Nature, which has been sparing of Brains, has made Amends for that Defect in Lungs.</P>
<P>This, you will say, is a singular Felicity, and very lucky for him. But if the young Theologue should not be satisfied with this; but, fired with the Praises of his Congrega∣tion, should imagine that they are not much mistaken in him? and should there∣fore aspire a little higher, how can we conceive which Way his Ends are to be brought to pass? How can we trace him out any further? Those who have any Prefer∣ments in their Gifts (of any considerable Va∣lue) are very often judicious and discerning; and if they have no Relation, or particular Friend, or Dependant to oblige, they are then willing to oblige themselves; and to shew their Knowledge of Men, are gene∣rally
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
inclined to prefer one of Learning and good Accomplishments; that from thence some of the Credit and Reputa∣tion of the Clerk may be reflected on the Patron.</P>
<P>This, one would think should put a Check upon the aspiring Thoughts of my young Divine: Or if notwithstanding he will take his Level; it must be at something which his Betters have refused; and which if he gets, it is because Nobody else would ac∣cept of it. The Value of which we may easily guess, when even such Numbers of learned and very worthy Men are so mean∣ly provided for.</P>
<P>I should descend further, and view him in this his accidental Benefice, and now in his Meridian, settled in the World, and be∣ginning to think that it is not good for Man to be alone: But here I shall leave him; his Condition in this State being much bet∣ter already described in a ludicrous Manner than I can do in a serious one.</P>
<P>However, as the Fault is not to be char∣ged on the unhappy Sufferer, it being im∣possible for any one to correct natural De∣fects; this should be a Warning to Parents
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
not to engage their Children in this Sort of Education, 'till their Abilities have been impartially weighed by them themselves; or which is better without having first had the Opinion of those, who may be prope∣rer Judges of them. This is however lit∣tle regarded! For too often the most un∣promising Child of the Family is pitch'd up∣on; and he whom the Father thinks to be unfit for any thing else, is dedicated to the Service of God: By which we may guess at the Understanding and Piety of the Fa∣ther, and presage the future Misery of the unhappy Son, and be sure to find him, where I before left him. Contemptible Ig∣norance and Stupidity as well as barbarous Cruelty to his own Child! What, does it require some extraordinary Talent to whoop after Bullocks and whistle after Sheep? a mighty Genius, to weigh a Pound of Figs, or to measure a Yard of Tape? whilst any thing will serve for the Altars of God. Pi∣ty is it and injurious to Society, that such sordid Parents should have the Disposal of and Authority to ruin their own Chil∣dren! But I am heartily tir'd with this me∣lancholy Scene, tho' it be a true Descrip∣tion
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
of the unhappy Case of many, who might perhaps have made very pretty Gra∣ziers or notable Handicrafts.</P>
<P>I confess that I have hitherto been deal∣ing in Dreggs, and drawing out the Pro∣spect only of Incapables; the Burdens of the Church, and very often it's Reproach and Scandal. These therefore may be thought Exceptions; and the unlucky Star reigning at their Birth to have been in Fault; but that every thing goes smoothly on with those, whose natural Capacities are suitable to the Task they undertake. I wish it was so, and that there were no Ruggs in their Way; but since there are I shan't hide them.</P>
<P>To begin with the Studies of those who are capable of them, for to be capable is nothing without Application. A Power to move without actually putting himself into Motion will never bring a Man to his Journey's End. He therefore that designs to take Holy Orders, and would rightly qualify for them; (so far as to commence a Workman that need not be ashamed) must with uncommon Diligence bend his Mind to the Study of the three learned
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Languages, the <HI>Latin, Greek,</HI> and <HI>He∣brew;</HI> for these are the Keys to Know∣ledge; and he that thinks to open the Lock without them, will find himself much mistaken, as he likewise will, if he does not set about these betimes. For it has been seldom found, that they who begin to learn a Language at the Meridian or Decline of Life make any great Profi∣ciency, or become skilful Professors of it. But here I must beg not to be mis∣understood; as if I meant that it was expected of a young Student at the Age of three and twenty to be a perfect Master of these Languages; I only mean that he ought to make what Progress he can in them (along with his other Studies) before he comes for holy Orders; that hereafter he may go on with the greater Ease.</P>
<P>And what wearisome Days and watch∣ful Nights does this Undertaking require? what deep Meditation and Recollection to treasure up Words in the Memory, and to store it with the Knowledge of Things? how often must he beat them over, sepa∣rate, divide, and digest them, before he will be ready in calling them forth upon
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Occasion? or be able to express himself, elegantly, clearly, and judiciously?</P>
<P>Little enough for this Work is the great∣est Part of his Time! and many Diversions must he maugre, to which Youth are na∣turally inclinable; the most ingenious as well as others: For the quicker the Taste, the stronger the Appetite; and the bright∣est Parts are not always the fittest for Ap∣plication.</P>
<P>Be that as it will; Adherence is abso∣lutely necessary; and they that set light to it, be their natural Talents ever so good, they will never supply the Defects of Idle∣ness, or gloss over their Ignorance: Which if it does not appear in downright Stupi∣dity and Dullness, it will however shew itself in Pertness and in palpable Blunders and Mistakes.</P>
<P>Fully for this Reason must the most pro∣mising Youth resolve, either to be con∣tent not to shine in the Church, or to be industrious.</P>
<P>For so far will he be (without it) from being intitled to any Manner of Applause and Reputation, that he will only add one more to the Number of Possibilities.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>Notwithstanding the Truth of this, as if Idleness wanted Patronage and Encourage∣ment, the learned Languages are com∣monly talked of and represented as dead Languages; and that by those who (for their own Sakes) should have been silent, and conceal'd their own Shame; and not have declared their Ignorance of them by this Expression, upon which to put the right genuine Interpretation; it is that the Representers are dead to the Languages, and to all good Intents and Purposes in Respect of their Profession.</P>
<P>What the learned Languages dead and useless to Clergymen, to whom is com∣mitted the Custody of the Law and the Prophets, the Gospels and Epistles?</P>
<P>Is there not a peculiar Idiom belonging to all Languages, more particularly to the <HI>Hebrew Tongue;</HI> and are there not some moral and political Words in the <HI>Greek,</HI> to which none answer in other Languages and which are hardly to be fully express'd in them? Or can the Sense and Meaning of any Author be so exactly understood in Translation, as in the original Language in which it was wrote?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>If this is manifestly the Case in Res∣pect of the holy Scriptures; what notable Commentators should we have without understanding <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Hebrew?</HI> They would soon verify the Parable; <HI>Can the Blind lead the Blind? shall they not both fall into the Ditch?</HI></P>
<P>To silence therefore this senseless Pre∣tence; let us for once suppose, that a ge∣neral Infatuation had seiz'd on the most learned Part of the <HI>English</HI> Clergy; and that they were all fallen from their pre∣sent Glory, and the Reputation which they justly have all over <HI>Europe</HI> for their Skill in all Parts of Learning; fallen so far, that there was not one of them left, who had any Manner of Knowledge of the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongues. What a fine Piece of Work would the Freethinkers and Li∣bertines of this Age make with the Holy Scriptures, and consequently Religion? who, tho' but Smatterers in Languages, yet when they had only <HI>Ignoramus</HI>'s to deal with, they might interpret as they pleas'd and slip any thing upon the Church. For should they affirm that such and such Pas∣sages in the Translation of the Holy Scrip∣tures
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
were spurious and false and quite contrary to the Original (and what would be more likely than for them to do this) who under such Circumstances could con∣tradict them?</P>
<P>The Church, so ably supported with Learning as it is at present, can scarcely prevent these Miscreants making some Proselytes, amongst the giddy weak and luxurious; but take away this Support, it must of Course sink, and a Torrent of all Manner of Errors and Vices would soon break in like a Deluge upon us; and if they could prevail so far; we should soon have the Doctrines of <HI>Epicurus</HI> esta∣blished by Law, and fathered upon the Scriptures.</P>
<P>But the Danger from that Quarter would not be the only one to be feared; for what if the Papists should get the Cu∣stody of the Scriptures again? I mean of the original Languages in which they were wrote? might we not in a little Time ex∣pect to see twelve more new lucrative Ar∣ticles of Faith tacked to <HI>Pope Pius</HI> his Creed? They might pawm as they would upon us, if they did but pretend that they
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
found them in the Original, and clamour loudly against our Translation, as partial and defective; for there would be no o∣ther Remedy than recurring to the Origi∣nal; but this would not be in the Power of our Clergy to do.</P>
<P>Is it not therefore absolutely necessary for those who wish Prosperity to our Church and Religion, and design to engage them∣selves in the Ministry, to prepare them∣selves for it by Labour and Study, as much as may be before they enter upon it; and afterwards likewise to continue the same? And this I would recommend to the timely Consideration of both them and their Friends; whether they think they will be able to undertake this and go thro' it; and even to persevere to the End of their Lives, or so long as their Faculties remain entire.</P>
<P>There is Nothing to be done without it; for the greatest Genius cultivated as it ought (thro' the short Time of Life allot∣ted) is not able to reach to, or compre∣hend all Parts of Science, or scarcely to finish or clear up one: Which takes away all Pleas for Laziness, and baffles the Suf∣ficiency
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
of some, who perhaps have the least Reason of any to pretend to it. For was there any allowable Excuse to justify this in one, the same would allow it to another, and so at last to all; which would of Course draw after it the Conse∣quences I a little before repeated. One Clergyman might plead his Right to La∣ziness another his and so all, 'till at Length Religion would be left to shift for itself.</P>
<P>Which Observation every Clergyman who is a Well-wisher to true Religion ought to apply to himself, and to consider (tho' the Church at present may thrive well enough upon the Stock of Learning which the great Men of it to their Ho∣nour possess) that it is but a mean and beg∣garly Thing to take Shelter under the Me∣rits of Others. For should no Emula∣tors of their great Accomplishments here∣after arise, we should soon see Religion brought to a very low Ebb: And even whilst these great Lights remain amongst us, what Numbers of Congregations in the mean Season (whom their Influence cannot reach) must suffer and be in the Dark, unless their Guides (to whose par∣ticular
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Charge they are committed) take Care to enlighten themselves and then their Flock.</P>
<P>When the Care of Souls becomes the Undertaking of any, their Labour and In∣dustry ought (as far as possible) in all Re∣spects relating to them to be proportiona∣ble to the Worth of them. Nor can the Ignorance and Meanness of those with whom they are entrusted ever be a reaso∣nable Excuse for their own; because they are sent on Purpose to clear up their Blind∣ness and Errors; and if they don't strive as much as they can to effect this, they do but trifle in their Office, and show themselves unfit for the Task they have undertaken.</P>
<P>Every one therefore that is lawfully allowed to be put in Trust with the Gos∣pel ought to lay his Hand upon his Heart and seriously reflect on the Duty incum∣bent on Him; and if it should happen to be his Lot to attend upon the weak in Understanding, he should on that Account be so far from despising them, or from thinking that he has then Freedom to in∣dulge, or that any thing tho' ever so
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
mean will serve their Turns, that instead thereof he ought to double his Diligence, and take more than ordinary Pains in shewing them the right Paths in which they ought to walk. This is the Duty of a good Clergyman, and the End of his Office, and every one that is in earnest will think so, and act agreeable thereto.</P>
<P>For whatever some may think, or even by Experience find, that there is no Ne∣cessity for all this Pains and Trouble, since there are easier and shorter Ways (and in some Respects more meritorious) of get∣ting at what they may set their Heart up∣on; yet let me tell them, that many of those Ways are dishonest and dishonoura∣ble; bring Contempt upon their Order; and, whilst true Merit is wanting, make them secretly despised even by those whose Designs they are carrying on. For No∣thing is surer, than that a good Stock of Learning, Integrity, and Virtue joined with a prudent Conduct are the only true Re∣commendations, and which alone can command Applause, Respect, and Esteem.</P>
<P>It is by these that the Affections of the sober and judicious Part of the Laity are
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
riveted in the Favour and Love of the Clergy and good Opinion of Religion; and it is by these that even from the prophane and injudicious Part of them a secret Re∣verence is drawn.</P>
<P>All Men are apt to admire those of ex∣alted Abilities and superiour to their own. Truths displaid and defended by such Ad∣vocates enter deep into the Hearts of the Hearers; the Convictions of their own Minds can't fail of drawing their Assent to them: And whether the Want of such Endowments has not very often given Oc∣casion both to the Contempt of some of the Clergy and Religion, I will leave every one to determine as he pleases.</P>
<P>The Generality of the better Sort of the Laity (whatever may be thought of them by some) neither want Learning, good Sense, or kind Inclinations. They are as quick-sighted as any whatever, are as good Judges of Men, and pleased with Merit whenever they find it; but if thro' Neglect or Supineness the Clergy sink be∣low their proper Standard they must not expect to conceal their Ignorance and Meanness, nor think themselves injured, if
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
Respect is withdrawn from them; since, when the Case is thus, they are not un∣justly dealt by; for the Laity then have a Right to Resentment and to complain; their Interest is concern'd; the Relation which the Clergy stand in to them as spi∣ritual Guides will be their Justification. For if a Gentleman might justly censure and contemn his Lawyer or Physician who should puzzle his Title to his Estate or endanger his Life thro' Blunders, much greater Reason has he to think meanly of those who are so ill qualified to take Care of his Soul, which is of infinitely greater Value. But to have done with this:</P>
<P>Let us then suppose a due Application and Improvement to have been made; and that the young Divine sets out in the World with all laudable Accomplishments; and that he is upon the Stock of these a∣lone to make his future Fortune. Being thus prepared I will not send him down into the Country to a Curacy (tho' that is the Lot at first of many worthy and de∣serving young Men) but will bring him in∣to the World, and place him in the Way to Preferment; amongst the great, the
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
rich, and distinguish'd Part of Mankind; and who are likewise able to distinguish Merit in others and have Power to re∣ward it.</P>
<P>Let him be fix'd then in the Metropo∣lis! It may be thought that now I have got him here, I may design to list him a∣mong the City Drudges. Nothing less I can assure you! I have more Regard for Merit.</P>
<P>In this desireable and happy Situation, being stocked with a sufficient Portion of Learning, Rhetoric, and Eloquence, it is likely e'er long (by an artful Management of them) that he may attract the Eyes of his Superiours; and that they may begin to look upon him as a Person that ought to be taken Notice of. The expected and lucky Hour now approaches, and the young Man is pitch'd upon perhaps to be Chaplain to some great Man, that a sin∣gle Patron may engross all the Merit: Or if he happens to be more popular than or∣dinary, the united Voice of Numbers may compliment him with a Lectureship in Town. Let us then survey him in both these Situations; whether he have the
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
one or the other, as likewise in their Sequel.</P>
<P>First then we will suppose him taken into the Family of some great Man for his Chaplain; that is as one who is to look af∣ter the Concerns of Religion in the Fami∣ly; a spiritual Steward, who by Virtue of his Office is as much oblig'd to take Care of my Lord's spiritual Affairs, as his tem∣poral Steward of his Estate; and is not to let him or his Family (without Warning or thro' his Neglect) squander, or keep be∣hind hand too much with Heaven, and run into Arrears; because some Time or other he may be called to an Account for it if he does. If we suppose a Chaplain without this Privilege, he is but a Cy∣pher; and like a Piece of old Plate in a Family, which serves only to adorn and grace a Side-Table, but is of no further Use.</P>
<P>But fancy for once that my Lord should not be in a Disposition for Prayer, and that he may have so much Business in this World, that he may not have Leizure to hear any thing about another; and that it would be thought impertinent and be
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
in vain to talk any thing to him about it; and that his Family (willing to imitate so shining an Example) might think them∣selves likewise better employed. I don't know of any Remedy in this Case, but be∣ing content to say Grace (if he can pre∣vail so far as to do this) when my Lord dines alone: For at publick Times, I sup∣pose it of Course, it being Part of the Pomp.</P>
<P>O happy Change of Times! for he may not only say Grace, but sit down at Ta∣ble too; and that for the most Part as long as others. This then has silenced the Wits and bilk'd them of their Satire; and they would be glad, now the Tables are turn'd, to exchange their Jokes for some of the Desert.</P>
<P>No, he does not withdraw, and creep about like a Thief in a Corner, and watch the Table narrowly, 'till some compassio∣nate Guest condescends to slide him a Sweet-meat; but with a modest Mein, fingers among the rest; tho' it must be confess'd that the Doubtfulness of his Ti∣tle abates some of his Assurance; it being
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
rather by Courtesy than by Right that he takes.</P>
<P>At other Times, if he is a Man of some tolerable Address, he may be per∣mitted to help to spend some of my Lord's retired Hours; and here the Foundation of his future Fortune is to be laid. If his Conversation pleases, and his Demeanour strikes his Patron's Fancy, his Business is done; and happy is it for him, if this comes to pass free from Incumbrances; and no contracted Stains pollute his Vir∣tue, nor any poor Female Relation of the Family or favourite <HI>Abigail</HI> blast his pro∣mising Hopes.</P>
<P>Some very good Benefice we will sup∣pose then is designed for him; and that when it falls he is put into Possession of it; and that (as a good Shepherd partly careful of his Flock, and partly tir'd with Attendance and Dependance) he goes down and resides upon it.</P>
<P>All Cares, now his Wants are supplyed, may be thought at an End; And that he has nothing more to think of (along with his Duty and his Studies) but the Enjoy∣ment of himself. This one would think
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
very reasonable, and what might be ex∣pected; but for all this there may, and in all Probability will be an unexpected Af∣ter-Game. Is he sure of his Dues after he has got his Benefice? That he has a legal and just Title to his Tithes (as clear as any Man has to his Estate or Goods,) is most certain; and likewise as good a Re∣medy for the Recovery of them.</P>
<P>In short is there not some one or more sturdy, covetous Peasant in his Parish? The short Character of whom, take from Dr. <HI>South;</HI> who says, <HI>Nothing is so rude and insolent as a wealthy Rustick. En no∣stri Fundi Calamitas!</HI> The Caterpillar that will either eat up Part of your Tenths, or destroy your Quiet! and put you to Dif∣ficulties in recovering that which you have a better Right to than he has to what is in his old leathern Purse at Home: If this Harpy (thro' the Negligence, Want of Skill, or Timidity of your Pre∣decessour) has set his Claws (for several Years) into one Part out of three of the Tithes in his own Occupation; by having shuffled him into some easie Composition; either by having abus'd his Credulity, or by
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
any other fraudulent tricking Way: You may as well venture to take a Lamb (ravi∣shed from your Flock) out of the Mouth of a Wolf, as to meddle with this old Sa∣crilegious.</P>
<P>Handle him but ever so gently and he cries out he is pinch'd: And that you are rapacious and greedy; and that if you don't take Care he will be even with you: And it is ten to one, but that he is so: For a whole Volume would hardly con∣tain all the little Arts these Misers invent (at the Instigation of their Malice) to ef∣fect this; and therefore I shan't trouble you with a History of them.</P>
<P>But abating the Uneasiness which must sometimes arise from this ill Usage; yet what a hopeful Prospect have you of the Success of your Ministry? What a mighty Influence will it be sure in particular to have over this old Cormorant? Who if alone, it would not be so much Matter; but because of his Circumstances, you can't expect him to be without Depen∣dants and Adherents, and perhaps a pret∣ty many too. For take this for certain that the Merits of the Cause will not be
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
examined into; and it is more likely that the Sheep will follow one another (even tho' a scabby one is their Leader,) than that they will follow their Shepherd.</P>
<P>This then you see may be some Check upon your promising Hopes of future Ease, Satisfaction, and Quiet. But happy would it be for you was this the only Impedi∣ment. For what if you should find in your Parish a pretty large Collection of Protestant Dissenters? You may be very sanguine and laugh at this indeed; and ask what Danger is there from such con∣scientious Men? Before, it is true, when you had to deal with one whose Consci∣ence Avarice had devoured, some Evil might naturally ensue; but in the present Case, it is not likely: For with whom could we wish to have Commerce sooner than with Men of so much Purity? I wish your Security does not entangle you. Would you like to have so many Spies upon all your Actions? This you may judge to be so far from being any Inconve∣nience, that it will be an Incitement to you to have a stricter Guard over your∣self; and, by that Means draw Advantage
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
from what looked untowardly at first. But will Innocence be always a Protection to you? Or was ever Man so innocent as not to be guilty of daily Slips? These Failings, then to which human Nature subjects us all, you may expect to have blaz'd abroad and perhaps magnified; and this too out of religious Zeal, and in or∣der to make Proselytes.</P>
<P>For no Men are more diligent that Way than these our Protestant Brethren: And there is no Way more likely for them to gain their Ends by, than by undermining you in the good Opinion of your People. For even the Vulgar pretend to be Judges of Mens Actions; will decide upon them, tho' they are far from being able to judge of the Merits of the Cause in Dispute be∣tween the Dissenters and us. By this Means then you see you may in all Proba∣bility have some of your Flock purloin'd from you: And this I am sure you would not very well like. For some Mortification it must needs be to see them exult and tri∣umph with Joy over any of your poor con∣verted Sheep, tho' ever so mean and ig∣norant.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36"/>But you may imagine that a little wary Conduct may place you upon better Terms with them; and a little Condescension bring you nearer together; and that you are not too stiff they will like you the bet∣ter. Now you begin indeed to be some∣thing nearer the Matter; and to shew yourself to be a Man of a calm Head; and promise fair to be popular in Time: For to become all Things to all Men, is very engaging. I suppose then to please them, you will in your Discourses or Wri∣tings model the Sacraments according to their liking, throw down Inclosures, level the Pastors of the Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> and tell them that the Differences between them and us are only nominal. This in∣deed would be obliging, might merit their Attention a little, and would make them begin to think that you was a Man of some Grace. But if this is all you would do, they would hardly believe you to be thoroughly in earnest: Nay they would think that you had more of a Courtier in you than a Primitive Christian. For what true Value could they have for such a lukewarn Advocate as you, even if you
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
was a Prelate, whilst you set fast in your Stall, and won't surrender it, or Part of it, as well as your Principles?</P>
<P>They will compare you to a Man that looks out of his Window from a warm Room in cold Weather, and sees several poor Objects starving without, and cries out I have a good Opinion of you; be warm my Brethren, but will not admit them in as Partners to share with him in his good Fire.</P>
<P>I don't know what can make the Dis∣senters think themselves more treacherous∣ly dealt with than such Usage, since it is directly striking at the Root of a darling Doctrine of some of them, which is <HI>that the Saints should inherit the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>This double Dealing then won't long serve your Turn. They will smell you out in Time, and think you as bad as the rest. For if you will only undermine your Gospel Right, but still hold your le∣gal Right; how are they the nearer to the Ends they aim at? Either then don't be quite so complaisant, or be more so, and give up all at once, and then you will get rid of all your Troubles together; but
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
if you are not willing to do this I must leave you here to manage as well as you can: Or if you are tired of it I will bring you into Town and view you in a Lectureship.</P>
<P>Some peculiar and winning Endow∣ments (where so many are concern'd) must have brought this to pass: But what they may be by Name I shan't further enquire.</P>
<P>I can't give him better Advice in this new Station than that of <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><L>—Servetur ad Imum</L>
<L>Qualis ab incepto processerit.—</L></Q></P>
<P>The same Spirit which gained him Favour at first, must be maintain'd, if he has a Mind to keep it.</P>
<P>Men of all Professions, of all Ranks and Conditions will be his Audience here: And therefore Matters must be carried with a very even Hand: And no Reflec∣tions levelled; no Vices publickly repro∣ved (tho' absolutely necessary to be so) which any considerable Part of his Con∣gregation may apply to themselves; that is if he has a Mind to have the same good Graces continued with which he sets out; and if he can be withal content to
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
part with his Integrity and Hazard his fu∣ture Happiness for the Sake of them.</P>
<P>I have heard (but the Case is not exact∣ly parallel because it was upon his Preach∣ing upon Approbation) of a Man (who af∣terwards made a very good Figure in the learned World) that lost one of these Lectureships in Town, for chusing these Words for his Text, <HI>let him that stole, steal no more:</HI> And if I am not mistaken the major Part of the Electors at that Time were Vintners and Taylors.</P>
<P>Caution and Circumspection are there∣fore requisite, and if a Man have a Mind to please, that Saying, <HI>that the Truth ought not to be spoken at all Times,</HI> can never be more applicable than in his present Station: If it was not for that necessary Thing called Duty.</P>
<P>We have all heard of the Court Chaplain, who thought it ill Manners to mention Hell and Damnation in the King's Chap∣pel. Such harsh Words he might imagine would sound oddly in such illustrious Ears; they might indeed (in his Opinion) be pro∣per enough in some mean inferior Congre∣gations, where the threatning to send them
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
to the Devil, might be the only Way to keep them from him: But the Great, the Rich, and Powerful (it may be he thought) would take it amiss at his Hands, should he alarm them with Terrours and Threatnings.</P>
<P>Where there are such Numbers of People, as are to be seen in some of the Churches in the City; a great Part of whom abound in Wealth, with which we all of us are too apt to be intoxicated: And amongst whom (notwithstanding they meet in the same Place) there are such great Diversities in Opinion, that I don't know a harder Task than a Lecturer (I'll say Incumbent, whom I take to be on the same Foot in several Respects) has to adjust nicely these Difficulties; and to be∣have himself with such Discretion so as not to offend. They indeed that can so mode∣rate Matters (without sinful and base Com∣pliances) are unusually happy; but if this is not their Lot, and some are offended only perhaps because they will be so; then does the Town presently ring with bitter Reproaches and Invectives; and their Doors and their Purses too are im∣mediately
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
shut, and no Entrance to be had but upon legal Demand.</P>
<P>But, Courage; this perhaps may never happen. Nay more, your Company may be welcome amongst them, wherever there is good Cheer to be found; and the Doctor may be expected to be there to sanctify the Feast.</P>
<P>Here will open to us one of the most ridiculous Scenes we have hitherto met with, and which will require some Ma∣nagement too. Have you never seen at these Invitations a little pert Fellow in a laced Wast-Coat or perhaps plain, newly arrived perchance from abroad, or perhaps lately redeemed from behind the Counter by the Death of some Relation who had no more Sense than to leave the Blockhead a plentiful Fortune to spend? If you have not already seen him, it is odds but you will find him at one of these merry Meetings.</P>
<P>You may go all the World over, and not meet with so ridiculous an Object as this is; unless it be of the same Species and Shape.</P>
<P>This Thing, who does not know where he is, or what he is; or how to take one
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
regular Step: Yet being naturally dully pert, and perhaps told by his new Foot∣man, or his old sedentary computing Com∣rades or others, that it is high Time for him to set up for a Gentleman; he begins to be of their Mind; and because a Gen∣tleman should have something besides the Benevolence of Fortune to distinguish him from the Herd; he therefore sets up for a Wit too. And what so fit to set out with, as with the Contempt of Religion and the Clergy? Take Care of yourself therefore, or he will be upon you. He will so Doctor you about, that you'll have scarcely Time to put one Morsel into your Mouth without being ask'd some imper∣tinent Question. Or he will fling at the Bottle-Screw, or <HI>nolo Episcopari,</HI> (if he has learn'd to sound the Words) or some other trifling stale Topick, which I should be asham'd so much as to mention, could I think of these Reptiles without it.</P>
<P>But hold a little; perhaps he may have got the Names of some of the Articles of Faith or some of the Ceremonies of the Church; I mention the Names, because I can assure you that he knows no more of
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
them or their Meaning than he does of one Word in the <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> or any other Language but what his Mother or Nurse taught him.</P>
<P>Granting all this; yet how do you think to manage with this Animal? You will say, I suppose, being a Man of Learning and Sense, that you heartily despise him. There's Reason in this I confess; but will this stop his Mouth? Or are there not sometimes in the Company, some who are as weak and vain as himself; and who be∣ing void of good Sense and good Man∣ners may be pleas'd with his Ribaldry and Impertinence, and may therefore laugh heartily at it? Or are there not even some sober, wise and thinking People in Com∣pany with you, who may nt be entirely a∣verse to this Babling? You may think that they have too much Wit to be pleas'd; and so they have to be pleas'd with the Man, they having the same contemptible Opinion of the Wretch that you have. But are you certain that all this while they don't laugh in their Sleeves? For to see a proud Priest mortified (which is the com∣mon
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
Appellation) is very bewitching, let it be done how it will.</P>
<P>Tell me now if you sit altogether ea∣sy notwithstanding? Or whether some of your Satisfaction is not abated? If it is not, you have a mighty Frame of Spirits; for most Men tho' bark'd at by the most piti∣ful little Mongrill Curr are under some Concern for their Heels; and the Braying of the Ass is disagreeable, tho' every one knows the Nature of the Beast.</P>
<P>This then is an Evil which will for e∣ver haunt you in the City. Nothing is so common as these whifling Creatures a∣bout Town. They are as constant at En∣tertainments, as Flies at the Shambles.</P>
<P>But you will say, are not the great Men of our Church a Sovereign Antidote, even against all Degrees of this Sort of Vermin? Do not the <HI>Hare's,</HI> and <HI>Bentley's,</HI> like Sun∣beams acting on Pestilential Vapours dis∣perse and make clear all around? So far I will agree with you that nothing can be keener than their Penns, and that they are Terrors to all the scribbling Part of the Fraternity; but the Bablers are left to the inferiour Clergy. If you can find a Re∣medy
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
for these, you will exceed the whole College of Physicians: For when the Pin∣eal Gland is disordered they are all at a Loss where to cut to make a Cure. You must therefore at last turn them over a∣mongst the incurables, as such virulent Scabs in the Body Politick, which Dr. <HI>Ward</HI> himself (was he in your Condition) would hardly venture to undertake.</P>
<P>I must not forget another Part of the inferior Clergy, and those of them too, who promise the fairest of any for an Ex∣emption; I mean those of great Fami∣lies and good Fortunes of their own, and who are therefore Independent.</P>
<P>These I confess are as happy, as they that have got Cloaks in rainy Weather, when others have none. But when the Storm hangs heavy over their Heads, it is odds but they will feel some of the Damp.</P>
<P>A Bungler can never gain Credit in a∣ny Profession; nor can a Journeyman a∣tone for the Master's Defects. If then they will take (as they in Conscience ought) the Duty and Service of their Function up∣on themselves, they must have the same
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
Quali∣fications with others, and use the same La∣bour to attain them; or expect to become Objects of Ridicule and Derision; and the more too on the Account of their Di∣stinction.</P>
<P>Every one will be inquisitive, and ask how it comes to pass (if they can have any Plea for the Question) that one who might have liv'd comfortably without the Reve∣nues of the Church, should thrust himself into it only for the Sake of them? So far then are such from being at Liberty to in∣dulge, or to be indolent and negligent in their Office, or in the qualifying for it; that they have rather a Spurr to it beyond o∣thers; because they may be suppos'd to be in the fairest Way to the highest Prefer∣ments of the Church. To aim at which without all the laudable Qualities neces∣sary for them, would be a Reproach on themselves; and if they should get them would be such a Stain on the Church, as none who have any Regard to any thing further than themselves would be willing to throw upon it. For all those who have a true Love for Religion or our Church, wish to see none in the highest Stations of
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
it; but Men remarkable for Learning, Or∣thodoxy, Morality, and Integrity. Such Men alone can be its Ornament, Credit, and Support; who rather cast a Lustre on their Office than their Office on them; and if such are to be found amongst those of high Birth and Fortune, and they are placed at the Head of the Church, it is still an Addition to its Glory.</P>
<P>Our Church therefore with open Arms embraces Youth of Rank and Distinction, who are willing to enter into it; and are drawn by the true Motive (which ought to induce any to it) the Love which they have for the Service of God and Religion. But we live in an Age sunk below the Standard of former Ages, and in which a great many are unacquainted with the Hi∣story of them. I mention this because it is the easiest Thing in the World to prove, that Men of the greatest Families in all King∣doms, and in all Religions have been Priests. But in our polite and refined Times it is accounted (by a great many) some Disgrace and a Lessening to a Gen∣tleman; and it is well for him, if he can keep up his former Rank after he has taken
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
this Character upon himself. The Cause of this you should enquire after, and ask them to give a Reason for their Opinion; it must be this or they have none, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is a Disgrace to be more immedi∣ately employed in the Service of the great God of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>It is pleasant to observe, what a Value some brutish senseless Clowns set upon themselves; I mean by Name, your rural Esquires the useless debauched and dreggy Part of them only; those of them who have been educated in the Stable or Dog-Ken∣nel; and whose Capacities and Habits are (agreeable to what they have been brought up to) mean and low. Be not surpriz'd! Yet forsooth a Priest (tho' of Family and Fortune, and adorn'd with all the fine Ac∣complishments which Nature and a gene∣rous Education can bestow on him) must look to himself, that he be not elbowed by these: And it would be taken very much amiss I can assure him, if he should be so bold as to assume the Preference; or so much as an Equality with them.</P>
<P>But I shall lastly take a View of those of my Brethren of the Clergy who are
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
immured in Colleges, and have at present few of those forementioned Difficulties to struggle with: And happy would it be for them, if they had none to encounter. But such is our Fate, that there is no secure Refuge for us.</P>
<P>Penury we all know is a Demon which haunts these Walls: And well would it be for them, if Syllogisms and Metaphy∣sicks could satisfy their Appetites and sup∣port Nature; but I am afraid they will be found to be too subtle for that Purpose.</P>
<P>By far the Majority of the Fellows of Colleges are in Circumstances below Envy; insomuch that it is surprizing to find that any should grudge them the poor Pittance they enjoy; or should think that College Lands might be canton'd out to better U∣ses. For if Learning is the greatest Orna∣ment, nay Support of a Nation: And if the Universities are the Fountains from whence are chiefly derived all the Bene∣fits which flow down to the Nation in ge∣neral by it: If the three learned Faculties are from hence so ably supplied, that Re∣ligion in its Primitive Purity is preached and propagated, that Justice is with so
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
much Skill and Impartiality maintain'd and distributed; and also that the Preser∣vation of our Health and Recovery of it is so well provided for: We may conclude that none but those who are Enemies to Mankind in general can be Enemies to these learned and venerable Bodies.</P>
<P>But whilst all these Blessings are con∣veyed from hence, a great many of the learned Sages residing there, and from whom they spring, are very poorly reward∣ed for their great Labour and Study. What they have at present bears no Proportion to their Merits: And if hereafter any thing happens in their Favour, it is generally too late; not 'till overmuch Study has ex∣hausted their Spirits, and Want of Health has disabled them from Enjoyment.</P>
<P>Besides their constant and assiduous Ap∣plication to Books has taken their Thoughts off so much from the World, that they are but little acquainted with it: Insomuch that when they come out into it, they are for the most Part ill prepared to struggle with the Difficulties, they are like to meet with. They are Strangers to all the little Tricks and Artifices, the Windings and Turnings
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
of those with whom they are likely to have Commerce; and may not suspect there to be any latent Guile in those whose Appearance is so mean and unpromising: Yet tho' it may appear something like a Paradox, many a Man of the greatest Learn∣ing, Sagacity, and Penetration has been most abominably impos'd on, and defraud∣ed in worldly Traffick; by those whose Capacities are but little superiour to some Brutes: The Thoughts of the one being wholly taken up with higher and more no∣ble Contemplations, and the others con∣fin'd only to the Invention of little Shifts and Disguises.</P>
<P>It may be expected perhaps (now I have finished what I designed in Respect of the inferiour Clergy) that I should go on, and survey the superiour Clergy, and make some amends for what I have already done: But that I shall defer 'till I have seen the Success of this Undertaking.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>TO confirm the Truth of what I have asserted, I appeal to Observation and Experience, and call upon living Wit∣nesses and Sufferers to bear Testimony; of whom I am afraid that there are too many to be found, more by a great many than I could wish, and whose Calamities I hear∣tily lament. Whose Calamities are owing to ungenerous Treatment; to a wicked and perverse Humour in some of the Lai∣ty; Part of whom are seduced by a vitious Avarice and Covetousness; and others by a vain and suspicious Dread of Emulation or they dont know what; and both of them fighting against divine Authority
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
and Dispensations, and defying the Armies of the living God.</P>
<P>Reasons for this we are to expect none; neither can any be given. For if at least the Majority of the Clergy (without Flat∣tery) bear Characters for Abilities in their Function, Inoffensiveness of Behaviour, and Integrity of Life, superior to most Men, inferior to none; what is there to be urged in Defence of such barbarous Usage? En∣vy could it ever cease, it should be then, when it sees Men in Distress. Could Slan∣der be ever silent, Innocence should strike it dumb. But wicked and vain Men are Proof against human and divine Admoni∣tions, and nothing will reclaim them.</P>
<P>However, (Coxcombs of every Educa∣tion being first excluded) to their Hon∣our will I speak it, that the greatest Men, I don't mean by Birth only, but who are great in themselves, and whose noble na∣tural Endowments and innate good Dis∣positions have been improved by a Uni∣versity Education, are very seldom guilty of Ridicule and Male Treatment; or if at any Time they give into the first, their Wit and Humour in some Measure atones
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
for it: There being as much Difference between the Treatment of these, and that of your proud, ignorant, rich, splenetick Fellows, as there is between the fine Hand of a skillful Chirurgeon, and the course Mangling of a Butcher.</P>
<P>Unreasonably troublesome it is very true that these latter are to their Betters; but if Good could be once brought out of E∣vil, and they should serve at last as Scare-Crows to keep off from the Church, such as might otherwise be more usefully em∣ployed, I must confess that I should then have a something more favourable Opini∣on of them than I have hitherto had. But if we can't make this Use of them, we shall be troubled to account for them, and may say as the honest Cheesemonger said by the Rats, I wonder for what use these Vermin were made.</P>
<P>Enough I hope has been said to lessen the Number of unskillful Traders in Di∣vinity, and to keep them from venturing when they are sure to meet with Storms, and to be disappointed of their imaginary Gains.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="55"/>Nothing however of this Nature will affright the pious and ingenious Youth from this his designed Undertaking. He knows that God into whose Service, he enlists himself, is able to protect him, and therefore resolves to serve him faithfully; and as he hopes to be able to do him bet∣ter Service this Way, than any other, he expects a greater Reward for it; but not till his Service is ended; not till the pro∣per Time for it comes, and therefore waits patiently for it.</P>
<P>He calls to mind the Dangers, Oppres∣sions and Persecutions of old, and even which have all along attended those who have been strictful faithful and diligent in the Service of God; and as he in no wise expects to be exempted from all of these, he is the less surpriz'd and dejected on that Account when they happen to him.</P>
<P>Transported with the glorious Figure which the Martyrs and Sufferers make in the Annals of the Church, he has an ho∣nest Ambition of being enrolled (if called upon) amongst their Number. Their Characters shining brighter in his Eyes than all the glittering Trophies of your
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
<HI>Alexanders</HI> and <HI>Coesars.</HI> The one having had for their Foundation a fervent Zeal for the Service of God; the others a viti∣ous Ambition which lead them on to Ra∣pine, Sacrilege, and Murder.</P>
<P>A Heathen or Infidel may indeed ap∣plaud the false Glory of the latter; but the Christian Hero views their black Crimes with Horrour, and disdains any Conquests but in the Service of God, and the Defence of true Religion.</P>
<P>The Ambition of the Youth that enters into the Ministry with an honest Heart, is to encourage and promote Piety and Virtue and all Manner of good Works; and to perswade as many as he can to the Practice of them that they may be there∣by happy and God from thence be glori∣fied; and if this is brought to pass thro' his Means his Desires are satisfied and he reflects on himself with greater Pleasure, and is much happier (even amidst Calum∣nies Abuses, and the Pressure of a low Fortune) than if by base Compliances and Prophesying smooth Things he had at∣tained to the highest Dignity. Not
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
that I think a Steadiness in his Duty to be an absolute Bar to Preferment; because that (with some forementioned Qualifications) is in my Opinion the only true Title to it; and I hope that the World is not yet so degenerate as generally to think or act otherwise. However Pre∣ferment is not the strongest Byass of a truly good Clergyman; for one who really is so, is content without it, or pleas'd with it according as he finds it inconsistent or consistent with his Duty. The Discharge of which is the ultimate End which he aims at in this World, and the Rudder which directs all his Actions. Could the Church be always filled with such, she would soon become the Praise of the whole Earth. And all true Lovers of our <HI>Sion</HI> will join with me in my hearty Wi∣shes, that she may never more want such.</P>
