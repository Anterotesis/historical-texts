<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of the following Tract is to prove that the plea of <HI>sudden Anger</HI> can∣not remove the imputation and guilt of <HI>Murder,</HI> when a <HI>Mortal Wound</HI> is <HI>wil∣fully</HI> given <HI>with a weapon:</HI></P>
<P>That the indulgence allowed by the Courts to <HI>voluntary Manslaughter</HI> in Rencounters, and in sudden Affrays and Duels, is <HI>indis∣criminate,</HI> and without foundation in Law:</P>
<P>And that <HI>impunity</HI> in such cases of <HI>volun∣tary Manslaughter</HI> is one of the principal causes of the <HI>continuance</HI> and present <HI>in∣crease</HI> of the <HI>base</HI> and <HI>disgraceful</HI> practice of Duelling.</P>
<P>Universal Benevolence, including <HI>gentle∣ness, patience</HI> and an unaffected <HI>placa∣bility</HI> in our behaviour, even towards those
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>men who injure and affront us, is manifestly required of all men, who profess the true religion; and yet, unhappily for the Christian world, this most obvious doctrine of the <HI>gospel of peace,</HI> is too commonly either mis∣understood, or else absolutely rejected, though the <HI>temporal</HI> as well as the <HI>eternal happi∣ness</HI> of mankind, greatly depends upon a conscientious and proper observation of it. For a man cannot be a true Christian with∣out observing this doctrine; and yet, so generally received is the opposite and contra∣dictory doctrine, concerning the necessity of revenging every personal affront with sword and pistol, for the sake of, what is falsely called, <HI>honour,</HI> that a true Christian is rarely to be with! Nay, we are fallen into such gross depravity, that the writer of a late publication on <HI><Q>the principles of penal law,</Q></HI> has ventured to assert, (tho' he is in other respects, as I am informed, a sensible and ingenious young gentleman) that <Q>the judge condemns the duellist, whilst
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>he scarcely knows how in his own heart to disapprove his behaviour.</Q> (p. 224.) So that one would suppose Christianity to be almost entirely extinct amongst us, if its principles are so little regarded, <HI>even in our courts of justice,</HI> where they ought to be held <HI>most sacred.</HI> My readers, perhaps, will start at such an idea in these enlightened days of reformation; but I will even go farther, and venture to assert, that the Europeans not only cease to be Christians, but will no longer deserve the name even of <HI>men,</HI> if they persist in such a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the most indis∣pensible principles of the laws of God and nature: for nothing deserves to be esteemed <HI>human</HI> that is <HI>unreasonable;</HI> and the de∣pravity, of which I complain, is not only incompatible with the laws of God, but absolutely inconsistent with <HI>common sense.</HI></P>
<P>Let us view the character of the <HI>mo∣dern man of honour</HI> (falsely so called)
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>who thinks it inconsistent with his reputa∣tion, to pass over a personal affront with that Christian submission, which the gospel requires of all men, without exception.</P>
<P>Such an one perhaps will alledge, that his <HI>honour</HI> obliges him, whenever he re∣ceives an affront, to <HI>call out</HI> his adversary, or <HI>to accept his challenge,</HI> lest his <HI>courage</HI> should be questioned; and therefore in such case, the one must give, and the other take, what is commonly called <HI>gentleman-like Satisfaction.</HI> But let us examine this per∣version of words. The <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to both parties is the risk both of <HI>body</HI> and <HI>soul,</HI> in the perpetration of a most <HI>dishonourable, base,</HI> and <HI>cowardly felony;</HI> which cannot, therefore, be <HI>gentleman-like,</HI> whatever the <HI>satisfaction</HI> of it may be. And 1st. It is <HI>Felony;</HI> because no man can give, or accept, a challenge, without being guilty of <HI>Wilful Murder,</HI> if he <HI>kills</HI> his antagonist; which I hope is proved in the course of the
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>following tract. 2ndly. It is <HI>dishonour∣able,</HI> because it is an open violation of the indispensible principles enjoined in the two great commandments of the supreme Law, viz. the <HI>love of God,</HI> and the <HI>love of our neighbour:</HI> for, in this respect, the offender is upon the same footing as culprits for <HI>bur∣glary, theft,</HI> or any other felony; the <Q><HI>not having the fear of God before his eyes,</HI></Q> being equally applicable to all of them; and the common law of England esteems no man qualified to be a member of society, who wants this principle. The act is therefore highly <HI>dishonourable;</HI> and to use a still more humi∣liating term of the same import, I must ob∣serve—3dly, that it is also <HI>base;</HI> because it affords the most apparent proof of a <HI>little Soul<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nec Christiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt, sed et philosophi, qui dixerunt <HI>pusilli esse animi contume∣liam ferre non posse,</HI> ut alibi ostendimus,</Q> says the learned Grotius, in his 2d book De jure Belli et Pacis, p. 172.</NOTE>;</HI> being, <HI>in reality,</HI> a <HI>brutal</HI> revenge;
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/><HI>brutal</HI> because <HI>unreasonable;</HI> (for how can <HI>Honour</HI> be vindicated or retrieved by the commission of a <HI>notorious Felony?</HI>) and what is <HI>unreasonable,</HI> must be disgraceful to human nature, and therefore is truly <HI>base.</HI></P>
<P>And lastly, it is <HI>cowardly</HI> (that is, when it cannot be imputed to <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Folly</HI>) because a man submits to it contrary to the light of his own reason, <HI>for fear</HI> his <HI>courage</HI> should be called in question; and yet <HI>he has not courage enough</HI> to withstand the bar∣barous prejudices of a depraved world, lest he should suffer some temporal inconveniencies: and the <HI>slavish Fear</HI> which he entertains of these (for <HI>cowards</HI> always dread the pre∣sent evil most) deprives him of that <HI>reason∣able fear,</HI> which he ought to entertain of God's judgment, because he thinks it at a distance, though, he knows, it must inevit∣ably follow!—I condemn no man in parti∣cular; God forbid! I speak of the question
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>only in general: inveterate prejudices and customs may perhaps afford some excuse in particular cases to some <HI>individuals,</HI> who have <HI>ignorantly</HI> yielded thereto: but as <HI>ignorance</HI> is disgraceful to <HI>humanity,</HI> I sincerely wish that all persons may enter into as careful an examination of this question as I have done, by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime, but also be prevented from attempting to defend what is past, and thereby afford the best proof of an ingenuous and honourable heart.</P>
<P>This abominable practice of duelling, which of late years has increased to a most alarming degree, may chiefly be attributed (I humbly conceive) to the improper indul∣gence which our English courts of justice, for about two centuries back, have shewn to persons <HI>convicted of killing in sudden affrays and rencounters,</HI> through a false idea of mercy due to human failty, in cases
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>of <HI>sudden provocation;</HI> without preserving the proper distinction of those cases wherein homicide, in <HI>sudden anger,</HI> is really excu∣sable by the laws of God, and of this king∣dom; and the <HI>improper precedents,</HI> which have arisen from this <HI>indiscriminate and corrupt practice,</HI> have so misled the more modern writers on <HI>Crown Law,</HI> that even the greatest and most respectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doc∣trines on the subject of Manslaughter, which are absolutely incompatible with the <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>necessary distinctions</HI> to be ob∣served between <HI>wilful murder</HI> and <HI>man∣slaughter,</HI> which they themselves have laid down in other parts of their works: and it is on the authority of these just <HI>distinctions,</HI> with the necessary consequences arising therefrom, (and not on my own presumption) that this censure is founded; which the following tract I hope will clearly demon∣strate.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="12"/>But as my readers might seem to give too much credit to an inconsiderable person like myself, were they, (without a previous intimation of what is proposed,) to risque any loss of time in the perusal of the argu∣ments and proofs at large, on which my vindication for this attempt depends, I think it my duty to state the subject and intention of the tract, as briefly as I can, in this pre∣fatory address, that my readers may, thereby, be enabled to judge, without much loss of time, whether the matter is of suf∣ficient consequence to merit any more of their attention.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned my opinion, that <Q>No man can give or accept a challenge to fight <HI>with weapons,</HI> on any private difference whatever, without being guilty of <HI>wilful murder</HI> if he <HI>kills</HI> his antag∣onist.</Q> And the intention of the follow∣ing tract is to shew, that the writers on Crown Law have no just warrant for ad∣mitting
<PB N="xii" REF="13"/>the contrary doctrines, which they have laid down concerning <HI>sudden affrays</HI> and <HI>rencountres, viz.</HI> that <HI>the voluntary killing</HI> of a man on a <HI>sudden provocation</HI> is only to be esteemed <HI>Manslaughter,</HI> and, as such, is intitled to the benefit of Clergy. And they have also supposed that <HI>an assault</HI> is a sufficient provocation to justify a <HI>volun∣tary manslaughter.</HI></P>
<P>Now, certain it is; that some allow∣ance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a <HI>sudden provocation,</HI> in considera∣tion of the extreme frailty of human na∣ture; provided that there are no circum∣stances of <HI>malice</HI> in the case. As if (for instance) a man, <HI>in sudden anger,</HI> should strike another, merely <HI>with his fist,</HI> or a small <HI>cane,</HI> or <HI>stick,</HI> meaning only to cor∣rect, and should <HI>accidentally kill;</HI> this would be, properly, <HI>manslaughter;</HI> which, though it is deemed <HI>Felony</HI> (as the act of striking, or beating another person is, in
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"/>itself, <HI>unlawful</HI>), is nevertheless <HI>pardona∣ble</HI> both by the laws of God and man. But when two persons fight with <HI>dangerous weapons,</HI> an <HI>intention of killing</HI> is <HI>ex∣pressed</HI> by the <HI>weapons;</HI> and <HI>such inten∣tion</HI> renders the manslaughter <HI>voluntary,</HI> which is the same thing as <HI>wilful;</HI> and consequently the <HI>"malice prepensed"</HI> (which excludes the benefit of clergy) is necessarily <HI>implied,</HI> though the sudden anger be but a moment before the fatal stroke; for <HI>"malice prepensed"</HI> is thus defined by Sir Edward Coke, <Q>That is (says he) <HI>volun∣tary,</HI> and of set purpose, though done <HI>upon a sudden occasion:</HI> for if it be <HI>voluntary</HI> the law implieth <HI>malice.</HI> <BIBL><HI>3</HI> Inst. <HI>c.xiii. p. 62.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And yet the same great lawyer in p. <HI>55,</HI> speaks of <HI>voluntary manslaughter</HI> upon <HI>some sudden falling out,</HI> as distinct from <HI>murder;</HI> which cannot, in reason, be true; for if the <HI>killing be voluntary,</HI> the evil
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/>and <HI>malicious intention</HI> is necessarily in∣cluded in the act, even though the fatal blow be given merely with <HI>the hand,</HI> or a <HI>small cane</HI> or <HI>stick,</HI> which I have before mentioned as pardonable cases, when the <HI>killing</HI> is not intended; for a <HI>voluntary striking,</HI> without intention to kill, is indeed pardonable, though death ensues; but a <HI>vo∣luntary killing</HI> is so far from being so, that the law, according to Lord Coke's own rule, <HI>implieth malice;</HI> and, consequently, the same must, necessarily, be esteemed <HI>Murder,</HI> and not merely <HI>Manslaughter;</HI> because the necessary marks, whereby <HI>manslaughter</HI> ought to be distinguished, are absolutely wanting therein: for <HI>manslaughter</HI> must be "without <HI>malice</HI> express or implied" (<HI>1</HI> Hale <HI>466. 4</HI> Blackstone <HI>191</HI>) "<HI>Murder</HI> being aggravated" (says Lord Hale) <Q>with ma∣lice presumed or <HI>implied,</HI> but manslaghter not.</Q> And yet all these great and excellent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the same error of treating the <HI>voluntary branch</HI> of
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>killing, as bare <HI>Homicide,</HI> or <HI>manslaugh∣ter;</HI> whereas, all the older writers agree, that <HI>killing</HI> is pardonable only in cases <HI>of inevitable necessity</HI> (Bracton, lib. <HI>iii.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI> p. <HI>120.</HI> b. Fleta lib. <HI>i.</HI> c. <HI>23.</HI>) And the learned Judge Staunford says <Q>That the whole matter consists in the <HI>inevitable ne∣cessity;</HI> without which the <HI>killing</HI> is by <HI>no means excusable</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">There is but one case of <HI>voluntary Killing,</HI> wherein the plea of <HI>sudden Anger</HI> and atrocious provocation may seem entitled to some indulgence and consideration: See Note in p. 46.</NOTE> (n'est ascun voi ex∣cusable.</Q> P.C. lib. <HI>i.</HI> c. <HI>7.</HI>)</P>
<P>Now, the absurd and depraved notions of <HI>honour,</HI> and <HI>gentleman-like satisfaction,</HI> of which I complain, could not possibly exist, if every conqueror in a duel, who kills his antagonist, was sure of being <HI>hanged up</HI> as an ignominious <HI>felon,</HI> for his own <HI>gen∣tleman-like satisfaction;</HI> and therefore I apprehend, that the diabolical practice of settling private differences with sword and
<PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>pistol is chiefly to be attributed to the want of punishment due to <HI>voluntary manslaugh∣ter,</HI> through the mistaken concessions of the Writers on Crown Law, and the false mercy of Juries, in consideration of <HI>sudden anger;</HI> because <HI>impunity</HI> fosters vice and depravity; but more especially in cases of <HI>wilful manslaughter,</HI> impunity ought to be esteemed the bane of society; as <HI>the guilt of blood</HI> is thereby thrown upon a whole nation or country; for it is a supreme law, that <Q>whoso sheddeth <HI>man's blood,</HI> by <HI>man</HI> shall <HI>his blood</HI> be shed. Gen. <HI>ix. 6.</HI> For <HI>blood</HI> it defileth the <HI>Land:</HI> and the <HI>Land</HI> cannot be cleansed of <HI>the Blood that</HI> is shed therein, but <HI>by the Blood of him that shed it.</HI></Q> <HI>(Num. xxxv. 33.)</HI> And I hope I have proved by incontrovert∣able extracts from the laws of God, that the said judgment is inevitably incurred by all <HI>voluntary killing,</HI> except in the legal pro∣secution of justice, and in the necessary de∣fence of our lives and properties; so that <HI>no
<PB N="xvii" REF="18"/>man</HI> has any legal or just right to pardon or re∣mit the punishment due to <HI>murder,</HI> or <HI>volun∣tary manslaughter</HI> (which are the same crime, and equally <HI>unpardonable</HI> in this world); for such an indulgence is not only a manifest sin against Almighty God, but also against the community at large, or <HI>country;</HI> <Q>for <HI>Blood</HI> it defileth the <HI>land;</HI> and the <HI>land</HI> cannot be cleansed of <HI>the blood</HI> that is shed therein, but <HI>by the blood of him that shed it.</HI></Q> Numb. <HI>xxxv. 33.</HI> This is not a ceremonial law, but a law of morality, founded in <HI>divine Justice,</HI> which must, there∣fore, be ever binding. Now as <Q>the <HI>Land cannot be cleansed, &amp;c. but by<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>manslaughter,</HI> so that even <HI>the king himself</HI> is absolutely restrained from it. See an act of the 2 Edw. III. whereby it is ordained, that a charter of pardon <Q>shall not be granted, but only where the king may do it by his oath; that is to say, where a man slayeth an∣other in <HI>his own defence,</HI> or <HI>by misfortune.</HI></Q> See also a Note in p. 48. on the further limitation of Royal Pre∣rogative by a subsequent Statute of 13 Ric. 2. (2 Stat. c. 1.) rendering it obnoxious to <HI>the wrath of God!</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="xviii" REF="19"/>the blood of him who shed it,</HI></Q> the <HI>Land</HI> is surely entitled to that expiation, as a matter of <HI>indispensible Right,</HI> which, when with∣held or withdrawn by <HI>Charters of Pardon</HI> to the guilty, is a manifest <HI>injury</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> to the <HI>land,</HI> i.e. to the whole Country or Kingdom; which opens to us the true ground and reason why the Royal Prerogative is so strictly and expressly limited in this point; for <Q><HI>Non potest Rex gratiam facere cum injuriâ et damno aliorum:</HI></Q> This is an ancient and constant rule "of Law." <HI>(3 Inst. p. 236.)</HI> and an <HI>injury, wrong,</HI> or <HI>da∣mage</HI> is surely <HI>most intolerable,</HI> when it is liable to affect the whole <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>Country,</HI> by rèndering it obnoxious to <HI>the wrath of God!</HI></P>
<P>I may probably be charged with an unpar∣donable temerity for presuming to censure the writings of some of the greatest and most learned men that this nation, perhaps, ever produced; and I am thoroughly sensible of
<PB N="xix" REF="20"/>the risk and ill consequences to myself, in case I am mistaken; but a sincere persuasion of being in the right, (arising from a laborious research and careful examination of the most cele∣brated and approved writers on Crown Law) obliges me to prefer, what I conceive to be <HI>truth,</HI> before the authority of the greatest names.</P>
<P>And even, though I should not have suc∣ceeded according to my own conceptions of the subject, yet, I trust, that my impartial readers will pardon any <HI>involuntary errors,</HI> that they find in the performance, especially if they see no cause to suspect any want of uprightness in the intention of it: and, at all events, I hope, that the attempt may, at least, be considered as a proof, that I am not afraid of difficulties and labour, nor of the risk of personal inconveniences, when I un∣dertake any point with a view of serving my country, or mankind in general.</P>

<P>NO MAN can give or accept a chal∣lenge to fight <HI>with weapons,</HI> and <HI>kill</HI> his antagonist (on any private difference whatever) without being guilty of <HI>Wil∣ful Murder,</HI> such as ought to be excluded from the benefit of clergy. For <HI>Wilful Murder</HI> is the killing of a man <HI>ex ma∣litiâ proecogitatâ</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pleas of the Crown 1678, p. 35. also 1 Hal. P.

C. 1678, p. 36.</NOTE>, and the intention to do harm <HI>makes it murder</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 36.</NOTE>; so that the allowance which the writers of the two last centuries have made for <HI>sudden anger</HI> (without preserv∣ing a proper <HI>distinction</HI> of the case where∣in it really deserves consideration) is unjust in itself, as well as dangerous to society; for few men would entertain such absurd notions of honour, as to think themselves obliged to revenge affronts with their <HI>swords</HI> or <HI>pistols,</HI> if the risque of being hanged up as felons and murderers for their own <HI>gentleman∣like satisfaction,</HI> was rendered obvious by
<PB N="3" REF="23"/>just and proper decisions of the Law on this point.</P>
<P><Q>In every charge of murder, <HI>the fact of killing being first proved,</HI> all the cir∣cumstances of Accident, Necessity, or Infirmity are to be satisfactorily proved by the prisoner, unless they arise out of the evidence produced against him: for the law presumeth the fact to have been <HI>founded in malice,</HI> until the contrary appeareth.</Q> Judge Foster, 255.</P>
<P>The cases of homicide which are justi∣fied or excused by the above-mentioned <HI>circumstances</HI> of <HI>Accident</HI> and <HI>Necessity,</HI> are well understood, and, by many emi∣nent writers, sufficiently explained un∣der the heads of <HI>Misfortune</HI> and <HI>Self-defence.</HI> But with respect to those cases of Homicide, which are attended with
<PB N="4" REF="24"/>circumstances of <HI>infirmity</HI> (the third branch of circumstances mentioned above) the writers on crown law in general have been <HI>very indiscriminate,</HI> notwithstanding that the true distinction between <HI>Murder</HI> and <HI>Manslaughter</HI> de∣pends entirely on a clear stating of those cases of <HI>infirmity,</HI> which really deserve consideration and excuse.</P>
<P>Judge Foster, indeed, is, for the most part, nice and accurate in his distinctions; yet he has paid so great a regard to the authority of <HI>precedents,</HI> that he has been unwarily led away (as well as other writers) from the necessary conclusions of <HI>his own arguments</HI> upon this point; I shall, nevertheless, make use of his words as far as they express my own opinion of the subject.— <Q>Whoever would shelter himself under the plea of <HI>Provocation</HI> must prove his case to the satisfaction of the jury. The
<PB N="5" REF="25"/>presumption of law is against him, till that presumption is repelled by contrary evidence. What degree of <HI>Provocation,</HI> and under what circum∣stances heat of blood, the <HI>Furor bre∣vis,</HI> will or will not avail the De∣fendant is now to be considered.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Words of Reproach, how grievous soever, are not a Provocation suffi∣cient to free the Party killing from the <HI>guilt of murder.</HI> Nor are inde∣cent provoking actions or gestures expressive of contempt or reproach, <HI>without an assault upon the person.</HI></Q> (p. 290.) But I think myself obliged to add that even <HI>an assault</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my Remarks (in p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp;c.) on Mr. Hawkins's assertions relating to this point.</NOTE><HI>upon the person</HI> is NOT <Q>a Provocation suffi∣cient to free the Party killing from the <HI>guilt of murder,</HI></Q> (though this
<PB N="6" REF="26"/>learned judge seems to think otherwise. See Sect. iii. p. 295) unless all the cir∣cumstances which are necessary to ren∣der it excusable by the plea of <HI>self∣defence</HI> can clearly be proved. For if <HI>the Killing</HI> in a sudden fray is not <HI>ex necessitate,</HI> (as in Self-defence, or in the lawful Defence of others), it must be esteemed <HI>voluntary;</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> is the same thing as <HI>wilful;</HI> which neces∣sarily includes <HI>malice.</HI> For Bracton says, <Q>Crimen non contrahitur nisi <HI>Voluntas nocendi</HI> intercedat &amp; voluntas et pro∣positum distinguunt <HI>Maleficium,</HI></Q> &amp;c. <Q>The Guilt is not incurred unless the <HI>intention of injuring</HI> intervenes, for <HI>the Intention and Purpose</HI> (or design) marks the <HI>Felony</HI> (or malicious Deed.)</Q> Lib. iii. c. 17.

<PB N="9" REF="29"/>that the learned Judge Foster certainly goes too far, when he insinuates, in the passage before cited, <Q>that <HI>an assault</HI> upon the person</Q> (without mentioning the necessary exception con∣cerning <HI>inevitable Necessity</HI>) <Q>is a pro∣vocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder.</Q> For a farther distinction (besides that of <HI>inevitable necessity</HI>) is also to be ob∣served, which is very accurately laid down, even by judge Foster himself, in p. 291, though the same would be use∣less, if <HI>an assault upon the person</HI> was to be admitted as a <HI>sufficient provocation</HI> to the act of <HI>killing.</HI> <Q>It ought to be remembered (says he) that in all other cases of homicide upon slight provocation<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">But I have already shewn that <HI>no provocation</HI> whatever can justify a <HI>voluntary</HI> or <HI>wilful killing.</HI></NOTE>, if it may be reasonably
<PB N="10" REF="30"/>collected <HI>from the weapon</HI> made use of, or from any other circumstance, that the Party <HI>intended to kill,</HI> or to do some great bodily harm, <HI>such Homi∣cide</HI> will be Murder. The mischief done is irreparable, and the outrage is considered as flowing rather from <HI>brutal rage</HI> or <HI>diabolical malignity, than from human frailty.</HI> And it is to <HI>human frailty,</HI> and to that alone, the Law indulgeth in every case of felonious Homicide.</Q></P>
<P>The first instance which he gives by way of illustration to this doctrine is cited from Judge Hale, vol. i. p. 473. <Q>If <HI>A.</HI> come into the wood of <HI>B.</HI> and pull his hedges, or cut his wood, and <HI>B.</HI> beat him, whereof he dies, this is <HI>manslaughter,</HI> because, though it was not lawful for <HI>A.</HI> to cut the wood, it was not lawful for <HI>B.</HI> to beat him, but either to bring him to a Justice
<PB N="11" REF="31"/>of Peace, or punish him otherwise according to law.</Q> But here Lord Hale is not sufficiently distinct in stating the case; because circumstances are wanting, which are necessary for the determination of such a case, whether it ought to be esteemed <HI>manslaughter</HI> or <HI>murder.</HI> The accurate Judge Foster was sensible of this want of <HI>necessary circumstances,</HI> and therefore adds, <Q>But it must be understood (says he) that he beat him, <HI>not with a mischievous intention,</HI> but meerly to chastise him for the trespass, and to deter him from committing the like. For if he had knocked his brains out with <HI>a bill or hedgestake,</HI> or had given him <HI>an out∣rageous beating</HI> with an ordinary cud∣gel beyond the bounds of a <HI>sudden resentment,</HI> whereof he had died, <HI>It had been Murder.</HI> For these circum∣stances are some of the genuine symp∣toms of the <HI>Mala Mens,</HI> the heart
<PB N="12" REF="32"/>bent upon mischief, which, as I have already shewn, enter into the true notion <HI>of Malice</HI> in the legal sense of the word.</Q> P. 291.</P>
<P>The next instance he mentions is that of the parker tying the boy to his horse's tail. Which was (says he) <Q><HI>held to be murder.</HI></Q> <Q>For it was a deliberate act, <HI>and savoured of cruelty.</HI></Q> But the third instance, viz. that of Sted∣man the soldier killing a woman <HI>with a sword</HI> (which Judge Foster mentions as a case that <HI>was held clearly to be no more than manslaughter</HI>) was, most cer∣tainly, <HI>wilful murder:</HI> for tho' it appeared that the woman had struck the soldier on the face with an iron patten; yet she afterwards fled from him, and he <Q><HI>pur∣suing</HI> her, <HI>stabbed her in the back.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now if such a case of <HI>wilful killing</HI> is to be esteemed only manslaughter, it
<PB N="13" REF="33"/>entirely perverts the just arguments already quoted from the same author concerning the cases wherein <HI>human frailty</HI> deserves to be <HI>indulged!</HI> May I not use his own words against him? That "these circumstances" (the pur∣suing, and stabbing the woman in the back) <Q>are some of the genuine symp∣toms of the <HI>mala mens,</HI> the <HI>heart bent upon mischief.</HI></Q> Whereas, if he had <HI>struck her</HI> merely with his fist, or with a small stick <HI>not likely</HI> to kill, and had unluckily, and against his <HI>intention, killed,</HI> it had been but <HI>manslaughter.</HI> For this is the necessary distinction for which I contend <HI>in all cases of killing</HI> where the <HI>striking</HI> (not the killing) is <HI>voluntary:</HI> and I cannot so well express my meaning as in the words of Judge Foster himself, though that sensible and acute reasoner is afterwards misled from the truth of his own doctrine, by
<PB N="14" REF="34"/>paying too much regard (I mean an <HI>indiscriminate</HI> regard) to the practice of the Courts, which, in this point, has frequently been erroneous.</P>
<P>In page 290, after the 1st section (already quoted) concerning the cir∣cumstances, which <Q>are not a provo∣cation sufficient to free the Party Killing from the Guilt of Murder,</Q> he adds, <Q>This rule will, I conceive (says he) govern every case where the Party Killing upon such provocation <HI>maketh use of a deadly weapon,</HI> or otherwise <HI>manifesteth an intention to kill,</HI> or to do some some great bodily harm. But if he had given the other a box on the ear, or had struck him with a stick or other weapon <HI>not likely to kill,</HI> and <HI>had unluckily and against his intention</HI> killed, it had been but <HI>manslaughter.</HI> The difference between the cases is plainly this. In the for∣mer,
<PB N="15" REF="35"/><HI>the malitia, the wicked vindictive disposition</HI> already mentioned, <HI>evidently appeareth:</HI> in the latter it is <HI>as evidently wanting.</HI> The Party, in the first trans∣port of his passion, intended to chas∣tise for a piece of insolence which few spirits can bear. In this case the benignity of the law interposeth in favour of human frailty; in the other its justice regardeth and <HI>punisheth the apparent malignity of the heart.</HI></Q> P. 290 and 291.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the same author, in p. 296, endeavours to excuse killing in <HI>sudden rencounters,</HI> without preserving this necessary distinction concerning <HI>"the use of a deadly weapon,"</HI> and <Q><HI>the intention to kill.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>To what I have offered (says he) with regard to <HI>sudden rencounters,</HI> let me add, that the blood, already too
<PB N="16" REF="36"/>much heated, kindleth afresh at every pass or blow. And in the tumult of the passions, in which <HI>meer instinct self-preservation,</HI> hath no inconsider∣able share, the voice of reason is not heard. And therefore the law, <HI>in condescension</HI> to the infirmities of flesh and blood, hath extenuated the of∣fence.</Q> But <HI>the Law,</HI> in reality, makes no such <HI>condescension,</HI> though <HI>the Courts of Law</HI> have, indeed, <HI>indiscrimi∣nately</HI> done so, and have occasioned a mul∣titude of bad precedents, wherein <HI>wilful murder</HI> has been excused under the name of <HI>manslaughter;</HI> and this unhappy dif∣ference between <HI>the Law,</HI> and the cor∣rupt practice of <HI>the Courts,</HI> with respect to this point, has unwarily led the more modern writers on crown-law into con∣cessions, which are absolutely <HI>contra∣dictory</HI> to the just doctrines laid down in other parts of their excellent works.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="37"/>When I speak of such respectable and justly revered authors as Sir Edward Coke, Sir Matthew Hale, Lord Chief Justice Holt, &amp;c. No person can conceive that I am misled by personal or party prejudice against their opini∣ons; and as I have, really, the highest esteem and veneration for their memory, not only as great and learned lawyers, but as true patriots, and, above all, as sincere Christians, and worthy honest men, I should not presume to contro∣vert any point that has been laid down by such excellent lawyers <HI>(so accomplished as above)</HI> was I not armed by <HI>their own authority;</HI> for <HI>no other authority</HI> is suf∣ficiently authentic for the purpose of correcting such deservedly esteemed wri∣ters; though I must acknowledge my obligation to the <HI>more ancient</HI> writers for the discovery of the errors of which I complain.</P>
<P>The proper distinction to be observed
<PB N="18" REF="38"/>between <HI>murder</HI> and <HI>manslaughter</HI> is well laid down by Sir Matthew Hale. <HI>"Mur∣der"</HI> (says he) <Q>being aggravated with malice <HI>presumed</HI> or <HI>implied, but man∣slaughter</HI> Not.</Q> 1 Hale's P. C. 466<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See also the Statute 52 Hen. 3. c. 25. made at Marlbridge, A.

<P>This rule is good and unexceptiona∣ble; and therefore it must appear, that even Sir Matthew Hale himself is mis∣taken in the paragraph preceding this quotation, where he says that <Q><HI>Man∣slaughter,</HI> or <HI>simple homicide,</HI> is the <HI>vo∣luntary killing</HI> of another without <HI>ma∣lice express</HI> or <HI>implied:</HI></Q> for though there may be a <HI>voluntary striking</HI> with∣out <HI>malice,</HI> yet I hope I have already proved, that there cannot be a <HI>voluntary killing</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="39"/>without <HI>malice express</HI> or <HI>implied,</HI> except in the legal execution of justice, and in the case of <HI>self-defence</HI> and its several branches, which some writers (rather improperly have, indeed, called <HI>voluntary</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lambard's Eirenarcha 255. Sir Edward Coke's 3 Inst. p. 55 and 56.</NOTE> though they proceed from an <HI>inevitable neces∣sity</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the note in page 4.</NOTE> Nevertheless even the great Sir Edward Coke (and before him the learn∣ed Lambard in his Eirenarcha, p. 250.) was guilty of this same impropriety of expression.

<PB N="20" REF="40"/>use such an expression concerning the writings of so great a man,) because the maxim "Delinquens per iram," &amp;c. can only be admitted in case where the <HI>malice</HI> is <HI>neither express</HI> nor <HI>implied:</HI> for instance, when the <HI>Striking</HI> is <HI>volun∣tary;</HI> but the <HI>Killing,</HI> or <HI>Manslaughter,</HI> is <HI>involuntary,</HI> and <HI>unexpected;</HI> as when a man, <HI>in sudden anger,</HI> gives an un∣lucky blow merely with his fist, or with a small stick, or small stone,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See judge Foster's comment on Rowley's case, wherein the difference of striking with a <HI>dangerous weapon,</HI> and with a small stick, or <HI>cudgel not likely to destroy,</HI> is well expressed, pages 294 and 295. <Q>I have always thought Rowley's case (says he) a very extraordinary one, as it is reported by <HI>Coke,</HI> from whom <HI>Hale</HI> cites it. The son fights with another boy and is beaten; he runs home to his father all bloody; the father takes a staff, runs three quarters of a mile, and beats the other boy, who dieth of this beating. This is said to have been ruled man∣slaughter, <HI>because done in sudden heat and passion,</HI></Q> (for which he cites 12 Rep. 87. and 1 Hale 453) "Surely" (continues judge Foster) <Q>the provoca∣tion was not very grievous. The boy had fought with one who happened to be an overmatch for him, and was worsted; a disaster slight enough, and very frequent among boys. If upon this pro∣vocation the father, after running three quarters of a mile, had set his strength against the child, had dispatched him with <HI>an bedgestake</HI> or <HI>any other deadly weapon,</HI> or by repeated blows with his cudgel, it must, in my opinion, <HI>have been murder;</HI> since any of these circumstances would have been a plain indication of the <HI>malitia,</HI> that mischievous vindic∣tive motive before explained. But with regard to these circumstances, <HI>with what weapon,</HI> or to <HI>what degree</HI> the child was beaten, <HI>Coke</HI> is totally silent. But <HI>Croke</HI> setteth the case in a much clearer light, and at the same time leadeth his readers into the true grounds of the judgment. His words are, Rowley struck the child with a <HI>small cudgel</HI> (God-bolt calleth it a rod, meaning, I suppose, a <HI>small wand</HI>) of which stroke he afterwards died. I think it may be fairly collected from <HI>Croke's</HI> man∣ner of speaking, that the accident happened by <HI>a single stroke</HI> with a cudgel <HI>not likely to destroy,</HI> and that death did not immediately ensue. The stroke was given in heat of blood, and not with any of the circumstances which import the <HI>malitia,</HI> the malignity of the heart attending the fact already explained, and therefore <HI>Manslaughter.</HI> I observe that Lord <HI>Raymond</HI> layeth <HI>great stress</HI> on this cir∣cumstance, <HI>That the Stroke was with a Cudgel not likely to Kill.</HI></Q></NOTE> (meaning
<PB N="21" REF="41"/>only to correct) which, <HI>undesignedly,</HI> oc∣casions death; for, in such cases, the
<PB N="22" REF="42"/><HI>malice</HI> is not <HI>implied;</HI> whereas, in a <HI>voluntary homicide,</HI> even a <HI>Malice pre∣pensed</HI> is implied, according to Sir Ed∣ward Coke's own definition of that term, viz. "That it is <HI>voluntary,</HI> and of set purpose, <HI>though it be done upon a</HI> <Q><HI>Sudden Occasion:</HI> for if it be <HI>Volun∣tary,</HI> the law <HI>implieth Malice,</HI></Q> 3 Inst. c. xiii. p. 62.—Sir William Blackstone has also fallen into the same error in his 4th vol. chap. xiv. p. 191. where he in∣forms us that Manslaughter is <Q>the un∣lawful killing of another, without malice either <HI>express</HI> or <HI>implied:</HI> which may be either <HI>voluntarily</HI> upon <HI>a sudden heat;</HI> or involuntarily, but in the
<PB N="23" REF="43"/>commission of some <HI>unlawful act.</HI></Q> In both of which he is also mistaken; for, with respect to the latter, his doctrine cannot be admitted, except in cases where the circumstances of the <HI>unlaw∣ful act</HI> amount only to <HI>a bare trespass</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Which he himself elsewhere allows.
<P>Judge Foster in his second discourse of homicide, p. 258. where he treats of <HI>involuntary homicide</HI> in the commission of an <HI>unlawful act,</HI> informs us, <Q>that if it be done in the prosecution of a <HI>felonious inten∣tion</HI> it will be <HI>Murder,</HI> but if the intent went no farther than to commit <HI>a bare trespass,</HI> Man∣slaughter, Though I confess (say he) Lord Coke seemeth to think otherwise.</Q> That is, Lord Coke did not even make an allowance for "<HI>a bare tres∣pass,</HI>" but seems to have been of opinion, That every case of <HI>involuntary homicide</HI> is to be treated as <HI>Murder,</HI> whenever the act which occasions death may be esteemed <HI>unlawful.</HI> See 3 Inst. p. 56. to which judge Foster refers. But that learned judge could not mean, that he differed in opinion from Lord Coke concern∣ing the first case there stated under the head of <HI>unlaw∣ful,</HI> viz. the unlawful shooting at a deer, whereby a boy was killed by the glance of the arrow; because that case must necessarily be esteemed <HI>Murder</HI> ac∣cording to judge Foster's own rule above-mentioned; for Lord Coke has clearly stated a <HI>felonious intention,</HI> viz. <Q>A. meaning <HI>to steal</HI> a deer in <HI>the park</HI> of B. &amp;c.</Q> It must therefore appear, that he refers only to the 2d case, there mentioned, of a man shooting at a cock or hen, or any <HI>tame fowl of ano∣ther man's;</HI> for a person might wantonly shoot at another man's pigeons, or poultry, without any in∣tention to <HI>steal them;</HI> which, I conceive, would amount, to no more than <HI>a bare trespass</HI> in judge Foster's sense of the word; because <Q>voluntas et propositum distinguunt maleficia; <HI>furtum</HI> vero non committitur <HI>sine affectu furandi</HI></Q> Fleta, lib. i. c. 33. p. 48. Whereas if Lord Coke had added, in the supposed case, that there was an intention <HI>to steal</HI> the tame fowl, Judge Foster could not, reasonably, have dissented from his opinion; because the crime must necessarily have been adjudged <HI>Murder</HI> according to his own rule; for the very same case has been so laid down by Lord Chief Justice Holt in a very clear manner, (see pages 56 and 57 of this tract) in order to explain Lord Coke's assertion; though Judge Holt himself is, as apparently, mistaken in his Judg∣ment of the other Case wherein the occasion was an intention to <HI>steal a Deer,</HI> which is, at least, as <HI>felo∣nious</HI> as the intention of <HI>stealing a Hen,</HI> that is, if the Deer be tame and <HI>inclosed</HI> in <HI>a Park</HI> (as stated by Lord Coke) by which the <HI>property</HI> is rendered ap∣parent: but if the case had been stated that the Deer was in a <HI>Forest</HI> or open chase, the offence <HI>(with∣out the accident)</HI> would be only a <HI>Trespass,</HI> (See Hawkins P. C. Book i. c. xxxiii. § 26); and the idea of this latter position may probably, have occasioned Lord Holt's mistake; for this circumstance would have rendered the <HI>accidental Killing</HI> of the Boy, only <HI>Manslaughter,</HI> agreeable to his opinions. Compare pages 54 and 57, wherein Lord Holt's opinions of these two Cases are mentioned.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="24" REF="44"/>For I propose, in the course of this tract, to mention several allowed cases, on
<PB N="25" REF="45"/>good authority, wherein even the <HI>invo∣luntary</HI> or undesigned killing is not deem∣ed <HI>manslaughter,</HI> but <HI>murder,</HI> when the acts, which occasioned death, were <HI>un∣lawful:</HI> and, with the respect to the for∣mer, it is a manifest <HI>inconsistency,</HI> in all these great writers, to rank <HI>voluntary killing</HI> under the head of <HI>manslaughter,</HI> in the modern <HI>confined</HI> sense of that <HI>once general</HI> term; because a <HI>voluntary kill∣ing</HI> (except in the case of <HI>self-defence,</HI>

Sir Matthew Hale is more accurate; for when he speaks of homicide <HI>ex necessitate,</HI> he informs us <Q>that this necessity makes the homicide not <HI>simply voluntary,</HI> but mixed, partly voluntary and partly involuntary, and is of two kinds,</Q> &amp;c. 1 vol. 478.</NOTE>) is certainly the same thing as a <HI>wilful killing;</HI> and either of them must be allowed to be the proper defi∣nition of what we now understand by the term <HI>Murder</HI> (though the meaning of that word was, originally, very dif∣ferent. See le Mirroir de justice, 1642, c. i. sect. xiii. p. 104. and Lambard's Eirenarcha, c. vii. p. 239.) because, in <Q><HI>a voluntary or wilful killing, malice</HI> is necessarily <HI>implied;</HI></Q> and, consequently, <HI>voluntary killing</HI> is excluded from the favour due to manslaughter by the rule
<PB N="27" REF="47"/>which these learned writers themselves admit, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>that manslaughter is with∣out out malice <HI>express</HI> or <HI>implied;</HI></Q> so that they are really guilty of a <HI>contradiction in terms;</HI> because the <HI>malice,</HI> or <HI>inten∣tion of killing,</HI> is <HI>undeniable,</HI> if the <HI>killing</HI> be <HI>voluntary</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><Q>And where a man doth any cruel and <HI>voluntary act</HI> whereby death ensues, <HI>it is murder, though done of a sudden.</HI></Q> See a little book dedicated to Lord Bathurst in 1724, intitled, The <HI>Laws</HI> of Liberty and Property, p. 67.</NOTE>: and therefore, as it is a maxim that <Q>Allegans contraria non est audiendus</Q> (Jenk.

<P>The errors, of which I complain, were not originally occasioned by these cele∣brated
<PB N="28" REF="48"/>authors, but by a previous <HI>cor∣rupt practice in the courts,</HI> which had been introduced by degrees, and at last unhappily prevailed, through a false idea of mercy and consideration for <HI>sudden anger;</HI> and also through the want of preserving the <HI>proper distinction</HI> of cases, wherein <HI>manslaughter</HI> in <HI>sudden anger</HI> is really excusable. The proper distinction to be observed is, when the <HI>inten∣tion</HI> of <HI>killing</HI> is not necessarily <HI>impiled</HI> in the act itself; as when a man strikes ano∣ther merely with his hand, in sudden anger; or thrusts him suddenly from him, whereby he falls and receives a hurt, which occasions death; in these, and similar cases, the striking, or thrusting is, indeed, <HI>voluntary,</HI> yet the <HI>killing,</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> is not so, but entirely undesigned and unexpected; which proper and necessary distinction the Law Commentators have unhappily neglected. For, though the act of <HI>stri∣king
<PB N="29" REF="49"/>or thrusting in anger</HI> bears some re∣semblance to <HI>malice,</HI> and though such an act is certainly <HI>unlawful in itself,</HI> yet it is reasonable to make some allow∣ance for the frailty of human nature, and the sudden passion of a man that is provoked, whenever <HI>a more criminal malice</HI> is not necessarily <HI>impiled</HI> in <HI>the act itself,</HI> which occasions death. And in this lenity we are justified by the laws of God, whereby such cases of manslaughter <HI>in sudden anger,</HI> as I have mentioned, were excused without any other penalty than that of banish∣ment to a city of refuge. <Q>If he <HI>thrust</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>The thrusting,</HI> here mentioned (which some writers seem to have misunderstood) does not mean a <HI>thrust</HI> with a sword or other weapon; for the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> has no such meaning, but properly signifies a violent thrusting or shoving away, as with the hand; or a sudden driving away, as chaff is drove before the wind, as Bythner remarks, "Proprie dicitur de vento, qui rapta prosequitur."

<P>But, it is remarkable, that these are the <HI>only</HI> two <HI>cases</HI> wherein <HI>an express proof of malice</HI> was required; for in all the examples given in the same chapter of killing <HI>with a weapon,</HI> or with <HI>a stone wherewith a man may die,</HI> (meaning such a stone as from its shape or size might be deemed a sufficient weapon to occa∣sion death) there is not the least men∣tion

<P>And the Levitical Law is, certainly, in this point, <HI>still binding,</HI> even under the dispensation of the gospel; because the reason and justice of it still subsists, as in other <HI>moral laws.</HI></P>
<P>So that the allowance usually made for <HI>sudden anger,</HI> when the blow is <HI>given with a weapon,</HI> is so far from deserving the name of <HI>"a proper distinction in the crime of killing,"</HI> (as some contend) that
<PB N="36" REF="56"/>it is apparently founded in <HI>a want</HI> of that <HI>proper distinction,</HI> which the laws of God and reason require, concerning cases of <HI>manslaughter,</HI> wherein <HI>sudden anger</HI> is really excusable; which can only be when <HI>the killing</HI> is not <HI>voluntary,</HI> or, at least, <HI>the intention of killing</HI> not apparent; as in the cases before-menti∣oned of a man striking another merely <HI>with his hand,</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See a case supposed by Judge Holt in his edition of Kelyng's Reports, 131.

In these and similar cases <HI>the malice</HI> or the <HI>inten∣tion of killing</HI> is not necessarily <HI>implied</HI> in the action itself; and, therefore, if all the other circumstances are also free from premeditated <HI>malice</HI> and laying in wait, the law has reserved a <HI>reasonable</HI> use of an <HI>unreasonable</HI> popish indulgence, called The Benefit of Clergy, to relieve the <HI>undesigning manslayer</HI> (if the occasion
<PB N="38" REF="58"/>was not <HI>unlawful</HI>) from the too great severity of the common law; for in such cases we may safely admit Sir Ed∣ward Coke's maxim, <Q>Delinquens per iram provocatus puniri debet mitius,</Q> 3 Inst. 55.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">"He who, provoked by anger, offends, ought to be more mildly punished."</NOTE></P>
<P>But a false idea of mercy, and consi∣deration for <HI>sudden anger</HI> unhappily pre∣vailing in the Courts, this lenity was <HI>indiscriminately</HI> extended even to cases where the <HI>prepensed malice</HI> was necessa∣rily <HI>implied</HI> by the stroke; so that the wretch, who stabbed his neighbour in <HI>brutal anger,</HI> escaped with impunity, to the scandal of public justice. The bad effects of this <HI>false mercy,</HI> and injustice, became so notorious in the reign of King James I. that the legislature was obliged to seek a remedy; and a statute was then made (1 Jac. I. c. 8.) by which the
<PB N="39" REF="59"/>benefit of clergy was taken away from <Q>the offence of <HI>mortally stabbing</HI> an∣other, though <HI>done upon sudden provo∣cation.</HI></Q> Judge Blackstone's Com. b. 4. c. xiv. p. 193. But unfortunately this remedy proved almost as <HI>indiscrimi∣nate</HI> as the abuse intended to be correct∣ed by it; for it takes no notice of any other crime than that of <HI>stabbing;</HI> as if <HI>sudden anger</HI> was not <HI>equally criminal,</HI> when a man is killed <HI>"by throwing a hammer or other weapon;"</HI> or by <Q><HI>a shot with a pistol.</HI></Q> Ibid. p. 194. Whereas, in truth, no new law was wanted: nothing but a better admini∣stration of the old laws before-menti∣oned; for, in all such furious sallies of <HI>sudden anger,</HI> the <HI>malice</HI> was necessarily <HI>implied,</HI> or <HI>presumed, from the weapon,</HI> as well in the laws of God (which I have already shewn) as in the law of nations: —"<HI>Ex telo praesumitur malum consilium</HI> (says the learned Grotius) <Q><HI>nisi contra∣rium
<PB N="40" REF="60"/>appareat.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><Q>From the weapon the evil intention is presumed, unless the contrary should appear.</Q></NOTE> And in his second book, de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis, he remarks, "that either <HI>iron, a club, or a stone,</HI> comes under the denomination of a weapon. <Q><HI>Teli</HI> autem nomine <HI>ferrum, fustis,</HI> &amp; <HI>lapis</HI> venit,</Q> c. i. p. 175.</P>
<P>The reason of the severity in the di∣vine law, against striking <HI>with a weapon,</HI> is well expressed by Dr. Wells in his paraphrase on Numbers xxxv. 16 to 19. <Q>Forasmuch (says he) as though he might have no malice to him before∣hand, yet his striking him <HI>with a sword,</HI> or <HI>hatchet,</HI> &amp;c. shews he had <HI>an intention</HI> to do him mischief;</Q> and, as another writer remarks <Q>though per∣haps he had no <HI>formed intention to kill</HI> the person; yet he ought to have mo∣derated his passion, and could not be
<PB N="41" REF="61"/>ignorant that <HI>such an instrument</HI> was capable of inflicting <HI>a deadly wound,</HI></Q></P>
<P>And, therefore, when a man is <HI>killed with a weapon</HI> (except it be by <HI>misfor∣tune,</HI> or in <HI>self-defence</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><Q>Regularly, it is necessary that, the person, that kills another <HI>in his own defence,</HI> fly as far as he may to avoid the violence of the assault before he turn upon his assailant; for though in cases of hostility between two nations it is a reproach and piece of cowardice to fly from an enemy, yet in cases of as∣saults and affrays between subjects under the same law, <HI>the law owns not any such point of honour,</HI> be∣cause the king and his laws are to be <HI>vindices in∣juriarum,</HI> and private persons are not trusted to take capital revenge one of another.</Q> 1 Hale, p. 481.</NOTE>, when the Slayer could retire no further to save himself without striking; or else in such law∣ful and reasonable cases, wherein a man is not obliged to give back; as in the case of a peace officer<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><Q>If a gaoler be assaulted by his prisoner, or if the Sheriff or his Minister be assaulted in the execution of his office, <HI>he is not bound to give back to the wall,</HI> but if he kill the assailant, it is in law adjudged <HI>se∣defendendo,</HI> though he <HI>gave not back to the wall.</HI> The like of a constable or watchman,</Q> &amp;c. 1 Hale, p. 481.

But this doctrine requires some further restriction; for the <HI>necessity</HI> of <HI>taking</HI> a thief, or retaking a prisoner, or that of executing a civil writ is not so great as to justify <HI>killing</HI> when the person endea∣vours to escape merely by flight; the <HI>Necessity</HI> can only be founded <HI>in his resistance,</HI> from which no man is bound to give back: and this will appear by Lord Hale's own words in another place, viz. <Q>But if the prisoner <HI>makes no resistance,</HI> but flies, yet the officer, either for fear that he or some other of his party will rescue the prisoner, strikes the prisoner, whereof he dies, this is <HI>murder,</HI> for here was no assault first made by the prisoner, and so it cannot be <HI>se defendendo</HI> in the officer.</Q>—And again, <Q>If a man be in dan∣ger of arrest by <HI>a capias</HI> in debt or trespass, and <HI>he flies,</HI> and the bailiff kills him, <HI>it is murder,</HI></Q> &amp;c. 1 Hales 481.

For if the officer in the heat of the pursuit, and merely in order to overtake the defendant, should trip up his heels, or give him a stroke with an ordinary cudgel, or other weapon, <HI>not likely to kill,</HI> and death should unhappily ensue, I cannot think that this will amount to more than <HI>manslaughter,</HI> if in some cases even to that offence.

So that this learned Lawyer really resolves <Q>THE INTENTION OF THE SAID ACT</Q> into the doc∣trine of the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> for which I contend, viz. <HI>"that blood"</HI> (i. e. wilful murder) <Q><HI>cannot be expiated but by the blood of the guilty.</HI></Q> And happily the Act seems also to have been <HI>effectual</HI> to accomplish that <HI>intention;</HI> for the learned Judge Blackstone, after citing Sir Edward Coke's opinion, that it was <Q>NOT THE INTENTION <HI>of the Parliament, that the King should ever</HI> PARDON MURDER <HI>under these aggrava∣tions</HI></Q> &amp;c. adds, <HI>"and it is remarkable enough"</HI> (says he) <Q><HI>that there is</HI> NO PRECEDENT OF A PAR∣DON <HI>in the register for any homicide than that</HI> which happens SE DEFENDENDO, or PER INFORTUNIUM.</Q> And with respect to the determination of the Court of K. B. cited by Salkeld 499, that <HI>the King may par∣don on an indictment of murder,</HI> as well as the subject may discharge an appeal; I observe, that the force of the learned Judge Holt's argument for that doctrine, rests on the repeal (in 16 R. 2. c. 6.) of the restrictions, and great difficulties which are put upon those that shall be suitors for <HI>a pardon of murder</HI> in this Act of 13 R. 2. which (said he) <Q><HI>were found</HI> GRIEVOUS TO THE SUBJECT:</Q> But that worthy and upright Judge would have acted on this point more like himself, if he had previously examined the nature of the supposed <HI>griev∣ance,</HI> whereby he would have known, whether it was really <HI>true</HI> and <HI>just,</HI> or only <HI>fained?</HI> For if the alledged <HI>"grievance to the subject"</HI> was only an <HI>unjust sugges∣tion,</HI> the whole Statute of <HI>Repeal,</HI> as far as relates to this point is <HI>null</HI> and <HI>void</HI> for the <HI>want of truth,</HI> as well as for being contrary to the 2d foundation of Eng∣lish law, "for <HI>contra veritatem nihil possumus:</HI>" and again <HI>"contraveritatem lex nunquam aliquid permittit".</HI> (2 Inst. 252 Plowden, &amp;c.) But above all, the FATAL END of King Richard II. should warn and deter all fu∣ture Monarchs from presuming to assert a PREROGA∣TIVE TO PARDON MURDER. The ill-fated Mo∣narch by his ignorance of the nature of <HI>Royal Preroga∣tive</HI> in a <HI>limited</HI> or <HI>politic government,</HI> prepared the way for his own destruction, not considering that his <HI>regality</HI> had no foundation but the <HI>law;</HI> and that his neglect of the latter, did necessarily undermine the former, which he afterwards severely experienced when compelled to deliver up both Crown and <HI>Regality</HI> with a public con∣fession of his own unworthiness to bear them: And it is remarkable, that the <HI>murders</HI> which had increased through his criminal indulgence, were awefully retali∣ted afterwards in his own <HI>blood:</HI> for, at last, he was himself, also, most cruelly and wickedly <HI>murdered,</HI> con¦trary to the laws of God and man, as if the <HI>blood</HI> which he had unjustly refused to <HI>cleanse from the land,</HI> and <HI>ex∣piate by the blood of the guilty,</HI> had fatally rested on his own head!!!</NOTE> that is to say, where a man slayeth another

<P><PB N="53" REF="73"/>And with respect to the second <HI>par∣donable case,</HI> mentioned in the said act of Edw.

<P>The cases of <HI>Misfortune or Accident,</HI> which are deemed <HI>Murder,</HI> are those wherein the act, which undesignedly occasions death, is in itself <HI>unlawful</HI><NOTE N="aa" PLACE="foot"><Q>For if the act be <HI>unlawful,</HI> I mean, if it be Ma∣lum in se, the case will amount to felony, either <HI>murder</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> as circumstances may vary the na∣ture of it.

<PB N="54" REF="74"/><Q>If the act be <HI>unlawful</HI> (says Lord Coke) it is <HI>murder.</HI> As if A. meaning to steal a deer in the park of B. shooteth at the deer, and by the glance of the arrow killeth a boy that is hidden in a bush; <HI>this is murder,</HI> for that the act was <HI>unlawful,</HI> although A. <HI>had no intent</HI> to hurt the boy, <HI>nor knew not</HI> of him.</Q> 3 Inst. 56. Lord Chief Justice Holt, indeed, says it is but <HI>manslaughter;</HI> in which he is mistaken<NOTE N="bb" PLACE="foot">See note in ps. 23, 24 and 25, and Judge Holt's own opinion on another case quoted in p. 56.</NOTE>. (See his Edition of Kelyng. Rex versus Plummer, 117.) But whether this be deemed <HI>murder</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> the <HI>killing</HI> is merely accidental, or by <HI>mis∣fortune;</HI> and, therefore, is certainly a much less crime than that of aiming at,
<PB N="55" REF="75"/>and striking a man <HI>with a weapon,</HI> or shooting at him in <HI>sudden anger,</HI> howso∣ever great the previous affront may have been. For, in the former case, though the <HI>shooting</HI> at a <HI>deer</HI> belonging to an∣other person is both <HI>unlawful,</HI> and <HI>vo∣luntary,</HI> yet the <HI>manslaughter,</HI> which it accidentally occasions, is <HI>involuntary,</HI> and without intention; whereas in the <HI>vo∣luntary</HI> aiming, and shooting at a man, the act itself is not only <HI>unlawful,</HI> but <HI>implies malice;</HI> or rather, I may say, the <HI>malice</HI> is <HI>expressed</HI> by the act; and the <HI>sudden anger</HI> is so far from being an <HI>ex∣cuse,</HI> that it is, absolutely, a further proof of the <HI>malice</HI> and <HI>intention</HI> of <HI>killing.</HI> The <HI>malice</HI> was also <HI>implied</HI> in the case of the Lord Dacres, though his Lordship was not half so criminal in <HI>his unlawful hunting,</HI> as the passionate man who strikes <HI>with a weapon.</HI> See how the case is mentioned by Lord Chief Justice Kelyng, (Rep. p. 87. published by Judge Holt.)</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="76"/><Q>The Lord Dacres and Mansell, and others in his company came <HI>unlawfully</HI> to hunt in a <HI>forest</HI><NOTE N="cc" PLACE="foot">Judge Kelynge was mistaken in this point: for the Lord Dacres probably would not have been treated with such severity, if <HI>the Trespass</HI> had been in a <HI>Forest</HI> or open chace; but it was in a <HI>Park</HI> belonging to Mr. Pelham in Surry (Crompton 25.) so that the <HI>unlawful</HI> Hunting was more than <HI>a bare trespass.</HI> See note, p 23, 24, and 25. See also 1 Hawkins, cap. xxxi. § 46. where another ground for the imputation of <HI>Murder,</HI> in that case, seems to be assigned, viz. a Resolution of Divers Persons to resist all opposers in the commission of <HI>a breach of the peace;</HI> though it be only, as he calls it, <HI>a bare breach</HI> of the peace.</NOTE>, and being resisted, one of the company, when the Lord Dacres was a great way off, <HI>and not present,</HI> killed a man; judged <HI>murder</HI> in him <HI>and all</HI> the rest, and the Lord Dacres <HI>was hanged.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Lord Chief Justice Holt supposes a case in his Rep. of Rex versus Plummer, p. 117. in the same book, which is in some degree similar. <Q>So (says he) if
<PB N="57" REF="77"/>two men have a design to steal a hen, and the one shoots <HI>at the hen</HI> for that purpose, and <HI>a man be killed,</HI> it is <HI>murder</HI> in both, because the <HI>design was felonious.</HI></Q> See also the last para∣graph of p. 56.3 Inst. concerning the shooting at a <HI>tame fowl,</HI> of which this case, supposed by Judge Holt, is an ex∣planation. But surely <HI>the design</HI> must be much more <HI>felonious</HI> when a man <HI>wilfully</HI> strikes his neighbour <HI>with a weapon in sudden anger;</HI> because this must neces∣sarily be allowed to be an act <Q>com∣mitted <HI>felleo animo,</HI> with a <HI>fell, furi∣ous,</HI> and mischievous <HI>mind</HI> and <HI>intent,</HI></Q> which is Lambard's definition of <HI>felony,</HI> c. vii. p. 224.</P>
<P>The <HI>implication of malice</HI> in the owner of a beast that kills a man, after warn∣ing given, will also further illustrate what has been said; for though mere carelessness or inconsideration might oc∣casion
<PB N="58" REF="78"/>his neglect, so that the accident may, in some degree, be esteemed a <HI>misfortune,</HI> yet the law implies <HI>malice;</HI> <Q>for if one keep a mastiff dog (says Sir James Astry, in his charge to grand juries, p. 18.) that is used to bite peo∣ple near the common highway; or bull or beast, that hath hurt any one (after notice) they kill any one, <HI>that will be murder in the Owner,</HI> although not present when the fact was done; and yet in this, and the other precedent cases, here is no <HI>express malice to be proved,</HI> but what the law construes to be so:</Q> this is agreeable to the doc∣trine of Judge Staunford, P. C. lib. i. cap. 9. <Q>Que si home ad un jument que est accustomé male faire et le Owner ceo bien sachant, negliga luy, eins suffra d'aller a large, et puis le jument tua un home: que ceo <HI>est felo∣nie</HI> in le owner, eo que, per tiel suf∣ferance: <HI>le owner semble d'aver volunté
<PB N="59" REF="79"/>a tuer.</HI></Q> See also Crompton, p. 24. b. and 1 Hawkins, c. xxxi. § 8. And, according to Bracton, the Common Law <HI>imputes</HI> the death of a man by a beast, to any man, who follows, or drives the beast at the time of the misfortune;— <Q>vel dum insequitur quis equum <HI>vel bovem,</HI> et aliquis <HI>a bove</HI> vel <HI>equo</HI> per∣cussus fuerit, et hujusmodi <HI>hoc imputa∣tur ei.</HI></Q> Bract. lib iii. c. iv. p. 120. b. If this law were still enforced, we should not have such continual complaints of accidents in the streets, by cattle, that are enraged, and made mad, through the cruelty of the two-legged brutes who drive them. For the first step that ought to be taken, in such cases, is, to seize <HI>the drivers;</HI> and, nineteen times out of twenty, it will be found, that the poor beast will recover it-self (when they are gone) from the excess of fear and rage which the Brutality of the <HI>hurrying

<PB N="61" REF="81"/>man who <HI>actually kills</HI> the person <HI>he aims at, in his anger,</HI> is at least as culpable! so that if <HI>sudden anger</HI> deserves no lenity in the former case, it certainly deserves none in the latter. Several cases also are mentioned by Sir William Blackstone, wherein <HI>sudden anger</HI> is not excusable, even though the death may be said to be <HI>"by misfortune,"</HI> as there was no real <HI>intention of killing, yet rendered by the circumstances</HI> <Q>equivalent to a deliberate act of slaughter.</Q> See Comment. b. iv. chap. xiv. p. 199 and 200. <Q>Also if <HI>even upon a sudden provocation</HI> (says he) one beats another in a cruel and unusual manner, so that he dies, <HI>though he did not intend his death,</HI> yet he is guilty of <HI>murder</HI> by an <HI>express malice;
<PB N="62" REF="82"/>that is, by an</HI> express <HI>evil design,</HI> the genuine sense of <HI>malitia.</HI> As when a park-keeper tied a boy that was steal∣ing wood, to a horse's tail, and drag∣ged him along the park; when a master corrected his servant with an <HI>iron bar,</HI> and a schoolmaster stamped on his scholar's belly; so that each of the sufferers died; these were <HI>justly held to be murders,</HI> because the cor∣rection being excessive, and such as could not proceed but from a bad heart, it <HI>was equivalent to a deliberate act of slaughter.</HI></Q> But is not <HI>an express evil design</HI> as apparent, in the act of stri∣king a man with <HI>a weapon, in anger,</HI> (be the <HI>anger</HI> ever so sudden) as it is in these cases where death was <HI>not really intended?</HI> For surely the <HI>design of killing,</HI> is by the weapon rendered express<NOTE N="ff" PLACE="foot"><Q>If one executes his revenge upon <HI>a sudden provo∣cation</HI> in such a cruel manner, with a <HI>dangerous wea∣pon</HI> as shews a malicious and deliberate intent to do mischief, and death ensues, it is <HI>express malice</HI> from the nature of the fact, and murder.</Q> Wood's Inst. 3 Book, p. 608.

See p. 39.</NOTE>; |which equally
<PB N="63" REF="83"/>fulfils <HI>"the genuine sense of malitia,"</HI> tho' perhaps, the <HI>prepensed malice</HI> may, more properly (<HI>upon a sudden provocation</HI> as above) be said to be <HI>implied</HI> than <HI>express.</HI> But whether it be <HI>express</HI> or <HI>implied,</HI> it undoubtedly constitutes <HI>murder;</HI> for <HI>malice</HI> is the leading circumstance which distinguishes <HI>manslaughter</HI> from <HI>murder,</HI> and therefore <HI>an express evil design,</HI> such as is apparent in the <HI>voluntary killing</HI> of a man, cannot be admitted under the head of <HI>simple homicide</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> because the necessary difference is want∣ing <HI>in the degree of the offence</HI> according to the excellent rule before cited from
<PB N="64" REF="84"/>Sir Matthew Hale, viz.— <Q>murder being aggravated with <HI>malice presumed or implied;</HI> but manslaughter <HI>not,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> 1 Hale, P. C. 466.</P>
<P>I may probably seem guilty of much tautology in this little Work; but hope my Readers will excuse it, in considera∣tion of the necessity I am under, of re∣peatedly comparing the crimes of <HI>stri∣king with a weapon</HI> in <HI>sudden Anger,</HI> and of <HI>voluntary Killing,</HI> with so many other different cases, wherein even <HI>involuntary</HI> and <HI>accidental</HI> Killing have been solemnly adjudged <HI>Murder:</HI> and I apprehend that <HI>the severity</HI> of the Law, in the last∣mentioned cases, must sufficiently de∣monstrate such <HI>a general abhorrence in our Law</HI> to the shedding of <HI>Human Blood,</HI> that we cannot reasonably sup∣pose <HI>the same Law</HI> capable of admitting an excuse for <HI>voluntary Manslaughter</HI> on
<PB N="65" REF="85"/>any private difference, howsoever great the provocation. Nevertheless, Mr. Hawkins ventures to assert a very dif∣ferent doctrine in his Pleas of the Crown, 1 Book c. xxviii. § 24. <Q>I see no reason (says he) why a person, who without provocation is assaulted by another in any place whatsoever, in such a manner as plainly shews an in∣tent to murder him, as by discharg∣ing a Pistol, or pushing at him with a drawn Sword, &amp;c. may not <HI>justify Killing</HI> such an Assailant, as much as if he had attempted to rob him: for is not he, who attempts to Murder me (says he) more injurious than he who barely attempts to rob me? And can it be more justifiable to fight for my goods than for my life? And it is not only highly agreeable to reason, that a man in such circumstances may <HI>lawfully Kill</HI> another, but it seems
<PB N="66" REF="86"/>also to be confirmed by <HI>the general Te∣nor of our Law-books,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But howsoever specious this argument may appear, I hope I have already proved <HI>"by the general Tenor of our Law-books;"</HI> that the <HI>Justifiable Kill∣ing</HI> of a Man must be through <HI>an inevita∣ble necessity:</HI> and therefore what Mr. Hawkins afterwards advances, in his comparison of such a case with Homi∣cide in <HI>se Defendendo,</HI> cannot in the least justify either his opinion on that point, or his assertion concerning <Q>the general Tenor of the Law-books.</Q></P>
<P>He endeavours to represent <HI>the Volun∣tary Killing</HI> of a Man as <HI>Justifiable Ho∣micide,</HI> and consequently he must sup∣pose it a less crime than <HI>Excusable Ho∣micide,</HI> in <HI>se Defendendo.</HI></P>
<P>He founds his opinion in the suppo∣sition of "some <HI>precedent Quarrel</HI>" in
<PB N="67" REF="87"/>the latter, "in which" (says he) <Q>both parties always are, or at least may <HI>justly be supposed</HI> to have been, in some fault, so that the necessity, to which a Man is at length reduced to kill another, is in some measure presumed to be owing to himself:</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But may it not, as <HI>"justly be supposed"</HI> that the person, who <HI>Kills</HI> without <HI>such necessity,</HI> is also <HI>"in some fault?"</HI> Is not the <HI>Presumption of Law</HI> against him (as I have elsewhere shewn) by the <HI>bloody</HI> FACT, when he cannot prove that <HI>he endeavoured,</HI> at least, to retreat, in or∣der to avoid unnecessary bloodshed? And is not FACT a more substantial ground for a criminal charge, than any idea that a Court can possibly form con∣cerning the <HI>Murderous Intentions,</HI> which <HI>the Killer</HI> may attribute to <HI>the person Killed?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="88"/>The single circumstance that <HI>the Killer</HI> was under <HI>no necessity</HI> of endea∣vouring to retreat, and avoid the assail∣ant, is not only a proof that <HI>his own in∣tentions</HI> (though he might not be the first aggressor) were nearly as criminal, as those he attributes to the <HI>person Killed,</HI> but it also affords a strong presumption, that <HI>the latter</HI> was not very strenuous or sanguine, either in his attack, or in his supposed <HI>intention to commit murder:</HI> so that the very pretence, by which Mr. Hawkins endeavours to justify such a <HI>voluntary Killing,</HI> must necessa∣rily fall to the ground, whenever <HI>the Killer</HI> is unable to prove, that he endea∣voured to avoid the attack<NOTE N="gg" PLACE="foot">I have already made the necessary exceptions con∣cerning Civil Officers in the legal Execution of jus∣tice, &amp;c.</NOTE> And tho' the Deceased might have had <Q>a Wea∣pon Drawn,</Q> yet that circumstance affords no positive proof of his <HI>criminal
<PB N="69" REF="89"/>intention;</HI> for he might have thought himself obliged to draw in his own de∣fence, through a reciprocal suspicion of his adversary's <HI>criminal intentions:</HI> and as he cannot plead his own cause, it is reasonable that the Law should <HI>pre∣sume,</HI> that he really did draw in his own defence, especially as the circumstance, that <HI>the Killer</HI> was under no necessity of endeavouring to avoid him, affords a sufficient Ground for such <HI>a presump∣tion:</HI></P>
<P>And even in cases where it may be supposed that the <HI>person Killed</HI> might really have had <HI>"an intent to murder,"</HI> we ought to remember that the Laws of England do not punish men <HI>merely</HI> for their <HI>"criminal intentions"</HI> without some fact! and, therefore, it would be highly absurd to suppose, that the Law, with∣out some apparent necessity, would en∣trust every individual, indiscriminately,
<PB N="70" REF="90"/>with a supreme Authority, which it de∣nies <HI>even</HI> to the Highest and most solemn Courts of Justice; I mean an Authority to inflict capital punishment without a previous Trial <HI>per pares;</HI> and that mere∣ly for <HI>"a Criminal Intention;"</HI> which, in many cases, might as easily, (through fear, passion, or violent prejudice) be mistaken, or imaginary, as be real!</P>
<P>And therefore <Q><HI>an Assault upon the Person</HI></Q> is not (as I have before in∣sisted in p. 5. against the opinion of Judge Foster) <Q>Provocation sufficient to free <HI>the Party Killing</HI> from the Guilt of Murder.</Q></P>
<P>The case of Gentlemen in the Army, nevertheless, seems peculiarly hard upon such unhappy occasions. The first prin∣ciple of their profession is <HI>Courage;</HI> and the World, in general, is too de∣praved to distinguish in what cases a
<PB N="71" REF="91"/>Man of <HI>true Courage</HI> may retreat <HI>with honour</HI> from the Assault of an Enemy; so that Military Men are liable to be <HI>unjustly</HI> despised, whenever they act <HI>rea∣sonably</HI> in cases either of insult, or as∣sault!</P>
<P>Yet, at the same time, it ought to be remembered, that those men who sub∣mit to <HI>the Slavish Yoke</HI> of other Men's depraved opinions or unreasonable cus∣toms (in contradiction to that <HI>natural Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Good and Evil,</HI> which they inherit, in common with the rest of Mankind, from our first Parents), can∣not <HI>justly</HI> be deemed <HI>Men of Honour;</HI> and, consequently, are unworthy of <HI>Rank</HI> in the honourable Profession of Arms. And though such men may support an outward <HI>appearance</HI> of <HI>Cour∣age</HI> in the eye of the world, by <HI>daring</HI> to violate the Laws of God and Man in <HI>private</HI> Quarrels, yet that very act af∣fords
<PB N="72" REF="92"/>the most manifest token of the Want of <HI>real</HI> and <HI>steady Courage:</HI> for unless the submission to that depraved custom can be attributed to <HI>inconsidera∣tion, or</HI> to <HI>the want of Knowledge,</HI> it must necessarily be supposed, that the <HI>Duellist had not sufficient Courage</HI> to as∣sert his <HI>natural Right</HI> of Acting agreea∣ble to the Dictates of his <HI>own reason and conscience;</HI> and was <HI>unable to face the Terrors</HI> of <HI>an</HI> adverse Fortune <HI>in a good Cause;</HI> and therefore, like a wretched <HI>Coward,</HI> he yielded himself a prisoner and slave to the fashionable Depravity!</P>
<P>I am far from meaning however to charge all Soldiers with Cowardice that have fought Duels: sometimes Passion and false Pride, but more frequently in∣consideration, and ignorance of the Laws of God and Man (as I have before hint∣ed) occasion the base submission and conformity to those <HI>false</HI> and <HI>unreasona∣ble
<PB N="73" REF="93"/>notions of Honour,</HI> which almost uni∣versally prevail.</P>
<P>Nor do I so much blame <HI>the Military Gentlemen,</HI> for this unnatural depravity, as I do <HI>the Professors of the Law;</HI> who ought to have set them a better exam∣ple, and yet, have rather contributed to <HI>the ignorance of the times,</HI> by the many <HI>gross perversions</HI> of <HI>our Law,</HI> which they have admitted into the Books. Gen∣tlemen of the Army are not obliged, in∣deed, to acquire a critical knowledge of the Law, but they must not forget that they are <HI>Men,</HI> as well as <HI>Soldiers;</HI> and that if they do not maintain the Natural Privilege of <HI>Men,</HI> (viz. that of thinking for themselves, and acting agreeable to the Dictates of their <HI>own Conscience,</HI> as Members of the Commu∣nity), they are unfit for <HI>British Soldiers,</HI> of whom the <HI>Law</HI> requires an acknow∣ledgement of <HI>her supremacy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="94"/>For the Law will not excuse an <HI>un∣lawful Act</HI> by a Soldier, even though he commits it by <HI>the express Command</HI> of the highest military Authority in the Kingdom: and much less is the Sol∣dier obliged to conform himself <HI>impli∣citly</HI> to the mere opinions and false No∣tions of Honour, which his Superiors may have unfortunately adopted.—Even in publick military Service, or warlike Expeditions by <HI>National authority,</HI> the Law manifestly requires the Soldier <HI>to think for himself;</HI> and to consider, be∣fore he acts in any war, whether the same be <HI>just;</HI> for, if it be otherwise, the Common Law of this Kingdom will <HI>impute</HI> to him <HI>the Guilt</HI> of <HI>Murder.</HI></P>
<P>And though the Law does not actually punish such general Crimes, as may un∣fortunately have obtained, at any time, the Sanction of Government, yet the time will certainly come, when all such
<PB N="75" REF="95"/>temporizing military <HI>Murderers</HI> must be responsible for the innocent blood that is shed in an <HI>unjust</HI> War, if they have rendered themselves <HI>accessaries to it by an implicit,</HI> and, therefore, <HI>criminal</HI> obe∣dience to the promoters of it. <Q>Item fit Homicidium <HI>in Bello,</HI></Q> (says the learned Bracton) <Q>et tunc videndum utrum <HI>Bellum</HI> sit <HI>justum</HI> vel <HI>injustum.</HI> Si autem <HI>injustum,</HI> tenebitur occisor: si autem <HI>justum,</HI> sicut <HI>pro defensione patriae,</HI> non tenebitur, nisi hoc <HI>fecerit corrupta voluntate et intentione</HI><NOTE N="hh" PLACE="foot">Bracton, Lib. 3. c. 4. <HI>de Corona,</HI> p. 121.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Men of <HI>true honour,</HI> therefore, at the same time that they are sensible of their duty as <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> to their King, must be mindful that they are <HI>subject also to the empire of reason,</HI> and are bound thereby, in common with all mankind, to maintain the <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>natural freedom</HI> of Human Nature: and
<PB N="76" REF="96"/>those Soldiers, who, in addition to their <HI>natural reason,</HI> have a true sense of <HI>Reli∣gion,</HI> will not only be mindful, that they are Soldiers and Subjects to an earthly King, but that they are also <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>the King of Kings;</HI> whose Laws and precepts they will, on all occasions, prefer <HI>to every other Com∣mand;</HI> and will obey the same with such a <HI>steady courage,</HI> as may be equal to every adversity, and undeserved suffering that threatens them.<NOTE N="ii" PLACE="foot">This doctrine is censured by a Critic in the Monthly Review for Jan. 1774, who calls it <HI>"a strange Princi∣ple!"</HI> In an age of Infidelity, indeed, it may, perhaps, be allowed (in one sense) to be <HI>"a strange principle";</HI> but then we have the greatest reason to lament the igno∣rance and depravity of those men who esteem it so in any other sense, than that of being <HI>too often</HI> neglected and transgressed! For I trust that no man, who admits or believes the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, will doubt the <HI>truth of it.</HI> If this <HI>"strange principle"</HI> had not been equally <HI>true,</HI> the English nation would long ago have been <HI>enslaved,</HI> and even the very <HI>standing Army</HI> itself would, by this time, have been reduced to that <HI>abject state</HI> of <HI>political slavery,</HI> which disgraces the <HI>standing Armies</HI> of unlimited Monarchies, and renders them very truly the <HI>"Abomination of Desolation,"</HI> and the <HI>Belluina Potestas,</HI> or <HI>power of the Beast,</HI> against which the vengeance of the <HI>Almighty</HI> is denounced in the Holy Scriptures. See a Note on the word <HI>command,</HI> or <HI>imperium</HI> in p. 59 of my Tract, on the <Q>Means of national Defence by a free Militia.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="97"/>It was this indispensible, this happy disposition, and sense of <HI>superior duty,</HI> which prevailed even in an unlawful standing Army, that had been <HI>raised,</HI> and was <HI>expressly designed</HI> for arbitrary purposes, and which, nevertheless, con∣trary to all expectation, exerted itself in saving this Kingdom, at the Glori∣ous Revolution, from the Political Slavery, which then threatened it, as well as from the more intolerable Tyranny of the Romish Religion.</P>
<P>The Soldier, therefore, who has not <HI>Courage enough</HI> to profess, on all occa∣sions,
<PB N="78" REF="98"/>a strict obedience to the <HI>Laws of his Country,</HI> according to the dictates of his <HI>own reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience, in prefer∣ence to every command, and every other opinion whatever,</HI> is unworthy of the British military service; being qualified rather to be inlisted with the slavish Troops of <HI>absolute</HI> Monarchs; or to serve in the Black Banditti of the Emperor of Morocco!</P>
<P>But I must return once more to the opinions of <HI>the Professors of Law</HI>— <Q>it is said<NOTE N="kk" PLACE="foot">This opinion is in the true stile of a <HI>Tradition,</HI> such as those, by which the Jews of old <HI>"perverted the Law."</HI></NOTE> that if he who draws upon another <HI>in a sudden Quarrel,</HI> make no pass at him <HI>till his sword is drawn,</HI> and then fight with him, and <HI>Kill him,</HI> is guilty of <HI>Manslaughter</HI> only,</Q> &amp;c. 1 Hawkins Pleas of the Crown, c.xxxi. § 28. for which he quotes Kelynge 55.
<PB N="79" REF="99"/>61. and 131: but <HI>the pretence</HI> for this indulgence is as <HI>frivolous</HI> as the Doctrine is <HI>false,</HI> viz, "because (says Mr. Haw∣kins) <Q>that by neglecting the opportu∣nity of Killing the other before he was on his guard, and in a condition to defend himself, with like Hazard to both, he shewed that his <HI>intent</HI> was not so much to <HI>kill,</HI> as to <HI>combat</HI> with the other, in compliance with those <HI>common notions of Honour,</HI></Q> &amp;c.—But is not <HI>"the intent to kill,"</HI> or to do some bodily harm, and certainly, at least, the Risque of <HI>Killing,</HI> included in the <HI>intention "to Combat" with dangerous weapons?</HI> And is it <HI>Justice?</HI> Nay! is it <HI>common Sense</HI> to excuse a <HI>Notorious Crime,</HI> by the Plea of an <HI>intention</HI> to commit <HI>another Crime</HI> almost as bad?</P>
<P>I have already shewn, by fair com∣parison with a variety of cases, that the crime of <HI>wilfully striking</HI> or <HI>Combating
<PB N="80" REF="100"/>with weapons in sudden Anger,</HI> is a much more <HI>unlawful act</HI> than many others, wherein even <HI>involuntary and accidental Homicide</HI> has been solemnly adjudged <HI>Murder,</HI> and has been generally admitted as such by the Sages of our Law in their Reports; and it will therefore be highly disgraceful to our Law, but more parti∣cularly (because <HI>deservedly</HI>) to the pro∣fessors of it, if they should still persist in the <HI>unreasonable</HI> and <HI>unjust</HI> practice of pu∣nishing <HI>lesser</HI> Crimes with <HI>more</HI> severity than the <HI>crying Sin</HI> of <HI>voluntary Man∣slaughter,</HI> which, as I have already proved in my preface, is absolutely <HI>un∣pardonable in this World,</HI> by the Laws of God!</P>
