<HEAD>A CARD, from the AUTHOR to DAVID GARRICK, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P><HI>REMOTENESS</HI> of situation, and some other circumstances, have hitherto deprived the Author of that happiness he might receive from seeing Mr <HI>GARRICK.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis the universal regard his cha∣racter commands, occasions this address.</P>
<P>It may be thought by many, (at a vi∣sit so abrupt as this is) that something highly complimentary should be said on
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
the part of the intruder; but according to the ideas the Author has conceived of Mr <HI>GARRICK</HI>'S delicacy and good sense, a single period in the garb of flattery would certainly offend him.</P>
<P>He therefore takes his leave;—and af∣ter having stept (perhaps a little too forward) to offer his tribute of esteem, respectfully retires.</P>

<L>ONCE on a time, his earthly rounds patrol∣ling,</L>
<L>(Your heathen gods were always fond of strolling)</L>
<L>Jove rambled near the cot of kind Philemon,</L>
<L>When night attended by a tempest came on;</L>
<L>And as the rain fell pattering, helter skelter,</L>
<L>The deity implor'd the hind for shelter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><PB N="136" REF="152"/>Philemon plac'd his godship close beside him,</L>
<L>While goody Baucis made the fire that dry'd him;</L>
<L>With more benevolence than one that's richer,</L>
<L>He spread the board, he fill'd the friendly pitcher;</L>
<L>And, fond to give his guest a meal of pleasure,</L>
<L>Sung a rough song, in his rude country measure.</L>

<L>Jove was so pleas'd with these good-natur'd sallies,</L>
<L>Philemon's cot he conjur'd to a palace.</L>

<LG>
<L>TO form a little work of nervous merit,</L>
<L>To give the sleepy stage a nobler spirit;</L>
<L>To touch a sacred muse, and not defile her,</L>
<L>This was the plan propos'd by our compiler.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' caution told him—the presumption's glaring!</L>
<L>Dauntless, he cry'd—"It is but nobly daring!</L>
<L>"Can we peruse a pathos more than Attic,</L>
<L>"Nor wish the golden treasure stamp'd dramatic!</L>
<L>"Here are no lines—in measur'd pace, that trip it,</L>

<LG>
<L>IN fond romance let fancy reign creative!</L>
<L>Valour amongst the northern hills is native;</L>
<L>The northern hills, 'tis prov'd by Ossian's story,</L>
<L>Gave early birth to Caledonian glory;</L>
<L>Nor cou'd the stormy clime with all its rigour,</L>
<L>Repel, in love or war, the hero's vigour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When honour call'd, the youth disdain'd to ponder,</L>
<L>And as he fought the fav'rite maid grew fonder.</L>
<L>The brave, by beauty were rejected never,</L>
<L>For girls are gracious when the lads are clever.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If the bold youth was in the field vindictive,</L>
<L>The bard, at home, had ev'ry power descriptive;</L>
<L>He swell'd the sacred song—enhanc'd the story,</L>
<L>And rais'd the warrior to the skies of glory.</L>

<PB N="152" REF="168"/>
<L>That northern lads are still unconquer'd fellows,</L>
<L>The foes of Britain to their cost can tell us;</L>
<L>The sway of northern beauty, if disputed,</L>
<L>Look round, ye infidels, and stand confuted:</L>
<L>And for your bards, the letter'd world have known 'em,</L>
<L>They're such—The sacred Ossian can't disown 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To prove a partial judgment does not wrong you,</L>
<L>And that your usual candour reigns among you,</L>
<L>Look with indulgence on this crude endeavour,</L>
<L>And stamp it with the sanction of your favour.</L>
