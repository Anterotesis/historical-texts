<P>IF the Nightingale be the songster of the grove, the Canary
Finch is the musician of the chamber. The melody of the former is derived
from Nature alone, that of the latter is directed and improved by our
instructions. With a weaker voice, with less extent of modulation, with
less variety of notes, the Canary Finch has a finer ear, greater facility of
imitation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> The Canary learns to speak, and
articulate many little names very distinctly. . . . By means of a flageolet,
it can acquire two or three airs, which it chants in their proper tone, always
keep∣ing due time, &amp;c. 
<BIBL><HI>Traité des Serius des Canaries, par
Hervieux,</HI> 1713.</BIBL> A Canary, which, when young, was placed very near
my desk, got an odd sorc of song; it imitated the sound made by telling
crowns. 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Hebert, receiver general at
Dijon.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, and <PB N="2" REF="15"/> a more retentive memory;
and, as the charac∣ters of animals depend principally on the quality of their
perceptions, this delicate bird, alive to every impression, becomes also
more social, more gentle; forms acquaintance, and even shews
attachment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It becomes so familiar and so fond of
caressing, that a thousand and a thousand times it comes to kiss and
bill its master, and never sails to answer his call. 
<BIBL><HI>Traité des Serins, par M.
Hervieux.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Its caresses are amiable, its little pets are
innocent, and its anger neither hurts nor offends. Its habits too approach
nearer to our own; it feeds on grain, like the other do∣mestic birds; it is
more easily bred than the Nightingale, which lives only on flesh and
in∣sects, and which requires its meals to be pur∣posely prepared. Its
education is attended also with greater success; it readily lays aside
the me∣lody of its native airs to adopt the harmony of our voices and
instruments; it eagerly follows the notes, and improves and heightens their
delicacy. The Nightingale, proud of its independent warble, seems desirous
to preserve its purity; at least, he slights our music, and can hardly
be brought to learn a few songs. The Canary Finch prattles or whistles; but
the Nightingale despises what he deems the perversion of his talents, and
perpetually recurs to the rich beauties of Nature. <PB N="3" REF="16"/> His
ever-varied song can never be altered by man; that of the Canary Finch is
more pliant, and can be modelled by our taste. The one therefore contributes
more than the other to the comforts of society; the Canary Finch sings at
all times, recreates our spirits in the gloomiest weather, and even adds to
our happiness; it amuses all young people, and is the delight of the
recluse; it relieves the languors of the cloister, and infuses
cheerfulness into innocent and captive minds; and its little loves, which are
manifest when it breeds, have a thousand and a thousand times awakened
the tenderness of feeling hearts. It is as useful, as the Vulture is
pernicious.</P>

Catalo∣nia, and probably in all climates of that temper∣ature. Some years,
however, it is very rare in the southern provinces of France, and
particu∣larly at Marseilles. Its song is pleasant and varied. The female
is inferior to the male both in the charms of its notes and in the beauty of
its plumage. The shape, the colour, the voice, and the food of the Venturon
and of the Canary, are nearly the same; and the only difference is, 
<PB N="5" REF="18"/> that the Italian bird is sensibly smaller, and its
warble neither so clear nor so melodious.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cini,</HI> or Green Bird of Provence, is larger than the
Venturon, and its tones are much fuller. It is distinguished by the beauty
of its colours, the loudness of its song, and the variety of its notes. The
female, which is ra∣ther larger than the male, and has fewer yellow feathers,
chants not like its mate, and answers only in monosyllables. It feeds on
the smallest seeds it can find in the field; lives long in a cage,
seems fond of lodging with a gold-finch, whose accents it seems
attentively to hear, and adopt, to vary its own warble. It occurs not only in
Provence, but also in Dauphiné, in the Lyonnois<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> I have seen in the country in Bugey, and near Lyons,

with moss. This bird, which is pretty common in the vicinity of Marseilles,
and in the south of France as high as Burgundy, is unfrequent in the northern
provinces. Lottin∣ger says it is only migratory in Lorraine.</P>
<P>The prevailing colour of the Venturon as well as that of the
Cini, is a green yellow on the upper part of the body, and a yellow green on
the belly; but the Cini, larger than the Venturon, is distinguished by the
brown colour which appears in longitudinal spots on the sides of the body,
and in waves below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>I shall here insert an excellent description of the
Cini, which M. Hebert sent to me. 
<Q REND="inline">"This bird is somewhat smaller than the
Canary Finch, which it much resembles. It has precisely the same plumage
with a kind of Canary called the <HI>Gray Canary,</HI> which is perhaps the
original bird, and the varieties are owing to domes∣tication. 
<P>"The fore-part of the head, the orbits of the eyes, the
under-part of the head, a sort of collar, the breast and belly as far as
the toes, are of a jonquil-colour, with a tinge of green. The sides of the
head, and the higher part of the wings, are mixed with green, jonquil, and
black. The back, and the rest of the wings, are dashed with green, gray,
and black. The rump is jonquil. The breast, though of a single colour, is
waved. The spots scattered on the plumage of the Cini are not distinctly
marked, but run into each other; those on the head are much finer, and like
points; on the two sides of the breast, and under the belly parallel to the
wings, are spots or streaks of black.</P> 
<P> "The tail is forked, consisting of twelve quills; the
wings are of the same colour with the back; the ends of the coverts at the
origin of the great quills, are slightly edged with a sort of dull yel∣low;
the great quills and the tail are similar, and of a brown ver∣ging to black,
with a slight edging of gray; the tail is shorter than that of the Canary
bird.</P> 
<P> "In general this bird is jonquil below, and variegated on
the back with different colours, in which the green predominates, though we
cannot assert that this is the ground colour; on the back not a single
feather but is variegated with several colours.</P> 
<P> "The bill is pretty much like that of the Canary, but
rather shorter and smaller; the upper mandible is level with the crown of
the head, has little concavity, broader at its base, and scalloped near its
origin; the lower mandible is more concave, placed dia∣gonally under the upper,
into which it is encased.</P> 
<P>"This Cini was only two inches and seven lines from the
top of the head to the origin of the tail, which was only one inch and ten
lines; the wings extend to the third of the tail; the legs are very slender;
the tarsus six lines long, and the toes near as much; the nails are not
regularly hooked."</P></Q></P> </NOTE>; whereas in <PB N="7" REF="20"/> our
climate, the common colour of the Canary is uniform, and of a citron-yellow on
all the body, and even on the belly: it is only the tips of the feathers
however that are tinged with that delicate hue, the rest of them being
entirely white. The female is of a paler yellow than the male; but this
citron-colour verging more or less on white, which the Canary assumes in
our climate, is not the tint of its native climate, for it varies according to
the different tempera∣tures. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have observed," says one of our most
intelligent naturalists, "that the Canary Finch, which becomes entirely white
in France, is in Teneriffe of almost as deep a gray as the lin∣net; this
change of colour is owing probably to the coldness of our climate."</Q> The
colour can be varied also by the difference of food, by confinement, and
above all by the mixture of <PB N="8" REF="21"/> breeds. In the beginning of
this century the cu∣rious in birds reckoned already twenty-nine va∣rieties of
Canaries, and all of them were distinctly described<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I shall here enumerate them all, beginning with those which

one before and the other behind, in a large cres∣cent of the same colour
placed on the back, pointing its concavity towards the head, and joining by its
horns to the two anterior black spots of the wings. Lastly, the tail is
surrounded behind by an half-collar of gray, which seems to be a compound
colour re∣sulting from the intimate mixture of black and yellow. The tail and
its coverts are almost white."

<P><PB N="9" REF="22"/> But, besides these primary varieties,
which seem to have been introduced by the change of climate, and some
secondary ones that have since appeared, there are others more apparent,
and which result from the union of the Canary with the Venturon, and with the
Cini; for not only do these three birds breed together, but the young hybrids
are capable of procreation. The same may be said in regard to the fruits of
the commerce of the Canary with the Siskin, with the Goldfinch, with the
Linnet, with the Yellow-hammer, with the Chaffinch, and even it is said with
the Sparrow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Arnault assured Salerne that he saw
at Orleans a gray hen Canary which had escaped from the volery, couple with a
sparrow, and make her hatch in a <HI>sparrow-can,</HI> which thrived. 
<BIBL><HI>Amusemens Innocens, on le Parfait Oiseleur,</HI>
1774.</BIBL></NOTE>. These birds, though very different from each other, and
apparently discri∣minated widely from the Canaries, can by pro∣per care and
attention be made to pair with them. The Canary must be removed from those
of its own species; and the experiment seems to succeed better when
performed with the female than with the male. The Siskin and Goldfinch are
the only birds with which, it is <PB N="10" REF="23"/> well ascertained, that
the male Canary can pro∣pagate. On this subject one of my friends thus writes
me; a person of as much experience as veracity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Father Bougot.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<Q> 
<P>"For thirty years past I have raised many of these small
birds, and have paid particular atten∣tion to breeding them; I can therefore
from long observation assert the following facts. When we wish to pair
Canaries with Goldfinches, we must take the Goldfinches at ten or twelve days
old, and put them in the nest with Canaries of the same age; we must
raise them together in the same volery, and accustom them to the same
food. It is usual to lodge the male Goldfinches with the female Canaries, and
they associate much more readily than if the female Gold∣finches were
joined with the male Canaries. We may observe however, that the union is more
tardy, because the Goldfinch is later in pairing than the Canary; on the
contrary, if the female Goldfinch be placed beside the male Canary they
sooner couple<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This proves (as we shall
afterwards observe) that the female is not so much stimulated to love by
nature, as roused by the solici∣tation of the male.</NOTE>. To succeed we
must never admit the male Canary into the voleries where there are female
Canaries, for he would then prefer them to Goldfinches<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gesner says, that a Swiss bird-catcher trying to pair a cock
Canary with a hen <HI>Sarzerine,</HI> (Cini,) had eggs, but that these were
addle.</NOTE>."</P> 
<P> <PB N="11" REF="24"/> "With regard to the union of the male
Ca∣nary with the female Siskin, I am certain that it succeeds well. I have
kept for nine years in my volery a female Siskin, which never failed to make
three hatches annually for the first five years, though the number was
reduced to two in the four following years. I have other Sis∣kins which have
bred with the Canaries, with∣out being raised or kept separately. We need
only leave the male or female Siskin in the chamber with a good number of
Canaries, and we shall perceive them pair with the Canaries, at the same
time that these pair with each other; whereas, to succeed with the
Goldfinches, they must be shut up in a cage with the Canary, and every bird
of the same species must be excluded. The Siskin lives as long as the
Canary, and eats the same food with much less reluctance than the
Goldfinch.</P> 
<P> "I have also put Linnets with Canaries; but there is seldom
success, unless we lodge the male Linnet with the female Canary; for the
hen Linnet makes no nest, but drops her eggs in the cage, and these are
generally addle. I have made the experiment with them, having placed them under
female Canaries, and frequently found that they did not hatch.</P> 
<P>"It is very difficult to pair Chaffinches and Yellow-hammers
with Canaries. I have kept for three years a female Yellow-hammer with a male
Canary, and it has laid only addle <PB N="12" REF="25"/> eggs. This has also
been the case with the female Chaffinch; but when the female Canary is
covered by the male Chaffinch and Yellow∣hammer she has prolific eggs."</P></Q>
<P>From these facts, and some others which I have collected, it
appears that the Siskin is the only bird of which the male and female
propa∣gate equally with those of the male or female Canaries. The female
Canary also breeds rea∣dily with the Goldfinch; not so easily with the
cock Linnet; and even produces, though with more difficulty, under the male
Chaffinches, Yel∣low-hammers, and Sparrows; whereas the male Canaries cannot
impregnate the females of these last. Nature is therefore more uniform and
permanent in the male than in the female; in the former the characters are
deeply imprinted; in the latter, the qualities are modified by the influence of
external causes. In the few experi∣ments which I have made on the union of
some contiguous species of quadrupeds, I observed that the ewe easily
bred under the he-goat; but that the ram could not propagate upon the
she-goat. I have been told of an instance in which a stag covered a cow;
but the bull has been known to copulate with the hind. The mare breeds more
readily with the jack-ass, than the she-ass with the stallion. In
general, mules par∣take more of the characters of the female than of the male,
whose features are more strongly marked.—These facts correspond
with those we <PB N="13" REF="26"/> have mentioned with regard to the
cross-breed of birds. It is evident that the female Canary is much more
related than the male to the species of the Yellow-hammer, of the Linnet, of
the Chaf∣finch, and of the Sparrow; since it breeds with all these, while
the male will not. I use the term <HI>will,</HI> for perhaps it is only from
a want of resolution that the female yields to the solicita∣tions of
those of a different species: however, an examination of the products of
this inter∣mixture affords conclusions that agree with all that I have said
of the generation and develope∣ment of animals; and as the subject is
import∣ant, I shall here state the principal facts.</P>
<P>The first variety which seems to constitute two distinct
families in the species, consists of the variegated Canaries, and those
whose plu∣mage is uniform. The white sort, or the yel∣low-citron, are never
variegated; only when the latter are four or five years old, the tips of the
wings and of the tail become white. The gray kind are not of an uniform colour;
some feathers are affected by different shades, and some individuals are
of a lighter or of a darker tinge. The agate is spread uniformly, though it
varies in the intensity. The pink coloured are more similar, the tint being
uniform, not only in different individuals, but in different parts of the
same individual. In those which consist of several colours, the
Yellow Jonquil sort are varie∣gated with blackish, and are commonly black
on <PB N="14" REF="27"/> the head. In some Canaries, the plumage is tinctured
with all the simple colours which we have mentioned; but the Yellow Jonquil
are the most variegated with black.</P>
<P>When Canaries are paired of an uniform colour, that of their
young is also uniform. If both parents are gray, for instance, the progeny
is also commonly gray; and this is the case with the pink, with the white,
with the yellow, and with the agate. If the parents be of different colours,
the fruits of their commerce will have a richer plumage; and as the
combinations that can take place are numerous, an immense va∣riety of tints
may be produced. But when the Canaries of an uniform colour are crossed
with those which are variegated, the changes are pro∣digiously multiplied,
and there is scarce any limit to the sportive modifications. Nay, it often
happens that parents of an uniform colour have beautiful variegated offspring,
derived from the mixture of shades in themselves or their progenitors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To have beautiful birds, we must pair the flaxen
variegated male with a white-tailed yellow female; or at least a variegated
male with a white-tailed flaxen female, or any other female that is
white-tailed, except only the gray. And when we want to ob∣tain a fine Jonquil,
we should set a black variegated male with a white-tailed yellow female. 
<BIBL><HI>Amusemens Innocens.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>With respect to the intercourse of the Canary with birds of
other species, I shall here state the observations which I have
collected. Of all <PB N="15" REF="28"/> the Canaries, the Cini or Green Canary
has the strongest voice, and appears to be the most vi∣gorous, and the
most ardent in propagation; it is sufficient for three female Canaries, and
while they are sitting in the nests, it supplies them and their young
with food. The Siskin and the Goldfinch are neither so powerful nor so
assidu∣ous, and a single female Canary satisfies their appetite.</P>
<P>The cross-breed of the Cini, of the Siskin, and of the
Goldfinch, with the hen Canary, are stronger than the Canaries, sing
longer, and their notes are fuller and more sonorous; but they are slower
in receiving instruction: for the most part, they whistle imperfectly,
and seldom one can be found that can repeat a single air com∣plete.</P>
<P>When we wish to have a breed of the Goldfinch with the hen
Canary, the former should be two years old, and the latter one, for the
Canary arrives sooner at maturity. It will be better if both be reared
together, though that precaution is not absolutely necessary; and the
Author of "the Treatise on Canaries" is mis∣taken in asserting, that
the hen must never have had commerce with a male of her own species, and
that this would prevent her from receiving those of a different kind. The
following fact is directly contrary to this opinion: 
<Q REND="inline">"I hap∣pened," says Father Bougot, "to put
twelve Ca∣naries together, four males and eight females. <PB N="16" REF="29"/>
Bad chickweed killed three of these males, and all the females lost their
first hatch. In the stead of these Cock-Canaries, I thought of
substitut∣ing three male Goldfinches which I caught, and put them into the
volery in the beginning of May. I had, towards the end of July, two nests of
young, which thrived as well as possible; and in the following year, I had
three hatches of each cock Goldfinch with the female Ca∣naries. These
commonly do not breed with the Goldfinch, except from the age of one to four;
while they continue prolific with their own males till eight or nine: and it is
only the variegated female that breeds with the Goldfinch after its fourth
year. We must never put the Goldfinch into a volery, for it demo∣lishes the
nests, and breaks the eggs of the other birds."</Q> It appears then that the
hen Canaries, though accustomed to the commerce of their own species,
listen to the invitation of the male Goldfinches, and submit without
reluctance to their embraces. The union is even as pro∣ductive as with their
proper mates, since they have three hatches a-year with the Goldfinch. The
case is different in the intercourse of the cock Linnet with the Canary,
there being com∣monly but one hatch, and very seldom two in the year.</P>
<P>The progeny of the Canaries with the Siskins, with the
Goldfinches, &amp;c. are prolific, and can breed not only with both the
species from which <PB N="17" REF="30"/> they sprung, but likewise with
each other; and thus may perpetuate an endless variety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sprengel has made many observations with regard to the
cross-breeds of the Canaries with other species, and particularly with the
Goldfinches; he has shewn that the progeny continued to propagate with each
other, and with the parent races. The proof which he has adduced is complete,
though before him these hybrids were considered as sterile. 
<BIBL><HI>Amusemens Innocens.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. We must
own, however, that the fruits of the inter∣mixture in these hybrids are far
from being so certain or so numerous as in the pure species; they
generally have only one hatch a-year, sel∣dom two, their eggs are often
addle, and the success depends on many minute circumstances, which it
would be impossible to observe, and still less to describe with
precision. It is said, that in these there are always more males than
females. 
<Q REND="inline">"A hen Canary (says Father Bougot) and a
Goldfinch have, in the same year at three different times, laid me nineteen
eggs, which all hatched, and of the young were only three females."</Q> It
would be proper to ascertain this fact by repeated observations. In the
pure breeds of several birds, as in the partridges, it has also been
remarked that the males exceed the females. The same remark applies to the
human race: in our climates, seventeen boys are born for six∣teen girls. We
know not the precise propor∣tion between the male and female partridges, but
that the former are more numerous than the latter we are certain, because in
the pairing <PB N="18" REF="31"/> season, there are always cock birds that
want mates. It is likely, however, that sixteen to three, as in the
cross-breed of the Canary and Gold∣finch, is a greater inequality than ever
takes place in a pure breed. I have been told, that the she∣mules, got
between the ass and the mare, exceed in number the he-mules; but I could
never ob∣tain accurate information on that subject. Our business then is
to determine by observation the number of males and of females in the pure
race of the Canary, and afterwards to examine if that of the males be still
greater in the cross∣breed of the Goldfinch and hen Canary. What disposes
me to entertain this opinion is, that the character of the male is in general
more deeply impressed on the progeny, than that of the fe∣male. These
hybrids, which are stronger than the Canaries, and have a louder voice, are
also longer lived. But there is an observation which applies alike to all,
that the period of their lives is abridged by their ardour in propagation. A
cock Canary raised by itself, and without inter∣course with the female,
lives generally thirteen or fourteen years; and the cross-breed of the
Gold∣finch will reach its eighteenth or nineteenth year. The cross-breed of
the Siskin, if kept apart from the females, live fifteen or sixteen years.
Whereas the cock Canary, which has one or several females, seldom lives
longer than ten or eleven years; the cross-breed of the Siskin eleven 
<PB N="19" REF="32"/> or twelve, and that of the Goldfinch fourteen or fifteen.
It is also necessary to part them from the females after the time of
hatching; that is, from the month of August to that of March; else the heat
of their passion would waste them, and abridge their lives by two or
three years.</P>
<P>To these remarks, which are all interesting, we may
subjoin a general and more important observation, which may throw some
light on the generation of animals, and the developement of their different
parts. It has been constantly noticed in the copulation of the Canaries, both
with those of their own species and with those of other races, that the
offspring resembled the father in the head, the tail, and the legs, and the
mother in the rest of the body. The same has been observed in quadrupeds.
The mule got between the jack-ass and the mare, has the thick body of the
former, and the ears, the tail, and the thin legs of the latter. It appears
therefore that, in the mixture of the two seminal liquors, how∣ever intimate
we suppose it to be, the organic molecules furnished by the female occupy
the centre of that living sphere which increases in all dimensions, and
that the molecules injected by the male surround and inclose these; so
that the extremities of the body proceed more im∣diately from the father than
from the mother. The skin, the hair, the colours, which may be considered
as the exterior of the body, retain most of the paternal impressions. In
the cross∣breed <PB N="20" REF="33"/> which I obtained from the copulation of
the he-goat with the ewe, they all had, instead of a soft fleece, the
shaggy coat of the male. In the human species, we may generally perceive,
that the son resembles the father more than the mother, in his legs, his
feet, and his hands; in his writing, in the quantity and colour os his hair,
in his complexion, and in the bulk of his head: and the mulattoes born of a
negress lose more of the dark tinge than those of a white woman. All
these facts seem to confirm our general idea, that the female molecules
occupy the centre of the <HI>foetus,</HI> and, though brought into the
closest union, are more abundant near the surface.</P>
<P>In general, the beauty of the species can never be improved or
even preserved, without crossing the breed: and the elegance of form, the
strength and vigour of the body, depend almost solely on the proportion
of the limbs. Accordingly, it is the males alone, which in man and in the
animals ennoble the race. Large, generous mares, covered by sorry little
horses, have always ill∣made colts; but a fine stallion will get a
beauti∣tiful progeny from even the ugliest mares, and the more dissimilar
are the kinds of the parents, the handsomer will be the offspring. The same
may be said of sheep: the breed is always improv∣ed by strange rams,
while the ordinary small sort can never get good lambs from the most
excel∣lent ewes. I could enlarge upon this important <PB N="21" REF="34"/>
subject, but I should make too long a digression. Yet, to detail all
the facts respecting the inter∣mixture of animals, would be the most real
service that can be rendered to Natural History. As many people employ or
amuse themselves in breeding Canaries, which requires little time, numerous
experiments might be made by cross∣ing them, and continuing to mix the fruits
of the embrace. I am confident that, by combin∣ing these observations with
those upon the qua∣drupeds and upon man, we might be able to estimate the
precise influence of the male in ge∣neration, compared with that of the
female; and consequently, from the general relations, to pro∣nounce whether
such a male would suit such a female, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But in the quadrupeds, as well as in man and in the small
birds, the difference of the moral qualities often disturbs the
correspondence of the physical properties. If any thing could prove that
the character of the individual is an original impression of nature which
education can never alter, it is an instance in the Canaries. 
<Q REND="inline">"They almost always" says Hervieux, "differ
from each other in their tempers; some males are always sad, and, as it
were, absorbed in re∣veries, generally bloated, and sing but sel∣dom, in
a mournful tone . . . . require an immense time to learn, are imperfectly
ac∣quainted with what they are taught, and easily forget it. . . . These
Canaries are often so slo∣venly, <PB N="22" REF="35"/> that their feet and
tail are always dirty; they never gain the affection of their females, which
they soothe not with their song, while engaged in hatching; and the young
are little better than their fathers. . . . There are other Canaries which are
so wicked, that they kill the female; the only way to succeed is, to give
them two females, which will unite in their common defence; and after
subduing their mate by force, they will retain the do∣minion by love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Sometimes the pravity of their
disposition is in a certain measure compensated by other qualities;
such, for instance, as their melodious song, their beautiful plumage, and
their familiar turn. If you would wish to make them breed, you must give
them two strong females one year older than themselves; and the fe∣males
should be accustomed for several months previous to live in the same
cage, that they may have no jealousy to each other. And a month before the
love-season, they must be both set together in the breeding cage, and
at the proper time the male should be let in among them. He will be very
quarrelsome the first three days, but the females, uniting against him,
will certainly in the end gain the ascendant, and he will be obliged to
submit, and at last become attached to them. These kind of forced
marriages often succeed better than others from which more might be expected.
To preserve the hatch, the first egg should be removed, and an ivory one
put in its place; the same must be done the following days, always taking
them away as fast as they are laid, lest the male should break them; and
after the last egg is dropped, the male must be shut in a separate
cage, and the female permitted to hatch undisturbed. After the young are
ready to be taken from the mother, the prisoner may be returned to his
female." 
<BIBL><HI>Traité des Serins des
Canaries.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Others are of a disposi∣tion so
barbarous, that they break the eggs and eat them; or if these have escaped
their ferocity, they lay hold of the callow brood by <PB N="23" REF="36"/> the
bill, drag them into the cage and murder them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"There are males of a weak habit,
indifferent about the females, and always sick after nestling; these
must not be paired, for I observe that the offspring resemble the father.
There are others so libidinous, that they drive the female from her nest,
and would not allow her to sit; these are of a hardy constitution, have a
superior song, a finer plumage, and are tamer. Others break the eggs, and
kill the young, the more to enjoy the female. Others shew a predilection for
an individual, and will, out of twenty, select their favourite, to which they
will pay particular attention. Those have a good temper, and will communicate
it to their progeny. Others discover fondness for no female, and remain
inactive and unproductive. The same difference of character and tempera∣ment
are to be found in the females. The jonquil females are most gentle; the
agate sort are capricious, and often desert their young to join the male;
the variegated females are assiduous on their eggs and affectionate to
their young, but the variegated males are the most ardent of all the
Canaries, and must have two or three females, else they will drive them
from the nest and break the eggs. Those which are entirely jonquil have
nearly the same fire of tem∣per, and require two or three females. The agate
males are the feeblest, and the females of that kind often expire upon their
eggs." 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Father</HI>
BOUGOT.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>."</Q> Some are so wild and independent, that they
will not suffer themselves to be touched or caressed, and can neither
be governed nor treat∣ed like the rest: they spurn at the least
interfer∣ence, and it is only when left to the impulse of their humours that
they will couple and breed. Others are excessively indolent; the gray for
instance scarcely ever take the pains to build a nest, but it must be
provided for them, &amp;c. All these characters are, we see, very different
from each other, and from those of our favourite Canaries, which are ever
joyous, and ever chanting; are <PB N="24" REF="37"/> so tame and so lovely;
are excellent husbands, and affectionate fathers; are of so mild a tem∣per,
and of so happy a disposition, that they re∣ceive every generous
impression, and glow with each exalted feeling. They continually amuse
the female by their song, they sooth the languor of her occupation, they
entreat her to take re∣lief in hatching, and, in her place, they sit
se∣veral hours every day; they also feed the young; and lastly, receive
whatever instructions are given. From these alone we are to judge of the
species, and I mention the others only, to shew that, even in animals, the
temper is de∣rived from nature, and not formed by edu∣cation.</P>
<P>Moreover, the apparently wicked disposition, which drives
them to break their eggs and kill their young, proceeds often from the fire of
their amorous passions. To enjoy the female oftener, and riot in the
fulness of pleasure, they plunder the nest, and destroy the dearest
objects of their affection. The best way to breed from these birds, is to
separate them, and put them in the cage; it will be much better to give them
a chamber having a sunny aspect, and facing the east in winter. For in
the cage they will break the eggs to repeat their embrace; but when they are
lodged in an apartment where there are more females than males, they will pay
their addresses to another, and allow the first to hatch undis∣turbed.
Besides, the males, from jealousy, will <PB N="25" REF="38"/> not suffer
disorders to be committed; and when one is prompted by ardor to tease his
female and break her eggs, they give him a sound beating, sufficient to
mortify his concupiscence.</P>
<P>The materials given to build their nest, are the scrapings
of fine linen rags, cows and stags hair, useless for other purposes,
moss, and slender dry stalks of hay. The Goldfinches and Siskins, when
lodged with the hen Canaries, to obtain a cross-breed, make use of the
moss and hay, but the Canaries prefer the hair and lint; but these must
be well divided, lest the fibres, sticking to their feet, should
occasion the eggs to be broken.</P>
<P>To feed them, a crib is placed in the chamber, which is pierced
all round with holes that admit the head; and into it a portion of this mixture
is put; three pints of rape-seed, two of oats, two of millet, and lastly, a
pint of hemp seed, and the crib is replenished every twelve or thirteen
days, taking care that the grains be well cleaned and winnowed. This food is
proper when they are only sitting; but the day before the young are excluded
from the shell, the parents ought to have a dry cake baked without salt,
and after eating it, they should have hard boiled eggs; one being
sufficient for two males and four fe∣males, and two for four males and eight
females, and so on in proportion. They ought to have no sallad or greens
while rearing the offspring, for this would weaken much the young. But to vary
somewhat their diet, they should every <PB N="26" REF="39"/> three days be
presented on a plate with a bit of white bread soaked in water, and
squeezed in the hand; this being not so rich as the cake, and preventing
them from growing too fat while breeding. It would also be proper to give
them a few Canary seeds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alpis</HI> in French, the
Canary-grass being termed <HI>Alpiste.</HI> It is the <HI>Phalaris
Canariensis</HI> of Linuaeus. It is a native of the Canary islands, whence
it springs spontaneously in the corn fields; but is now cultivated in
small qu ntities in many parts of Europe.</NOTE>, but only once in two days,
lest they be heated too much. Sugar biscuit commonly produces that effect,
and is attended with another still worse, that the hens fed on it lay eggs
that are addle, or too small and tender. When the eggs are small, the
rape∣seed should be boiled every day to blunt its acri∣mony. 
<Q REND="inline">"Long experience," says Father Bou∣got, "has
informed us, that this sort of food agrees best, whatever the authors, who
have written on Canaries, may assert."</Q></P>
<P>After the hatch, the Canaries ought to be purged with plantain
and lettuce-seeds; but care must be taken to remove the young birds, which
would be greatly weakened by this regimen, and the parents must not be
confined to it longer than two days. When you want to feed them with the
stick, you ought not, as most bird-catchers advise, leave them with the
mother till the eleventh or twelfth day; you ought to remove them with their
nest as early as the eighth day. The food for the young <PB N="27" REF="40"/>
Canaries ought to be prepared before hand; it is a paste composed of boiled
rape-seed, yolks of eggs and crumbs of cake mixed together, and beaten up
with a little water. It ought to be given to them every two hours, and rammed
into their bill. It must not be too liquid, lest it turn sour, and it
must be made fresh every day till the young can eat without
assistance.</P>
<P>The produce of these captive birds is not so regular, but
appears to be more numerous than it probably would be in the state of
liberty. Some females have four or five hatches annually, and lay four, five,
six, or even seven eggs each time; and generally they have three hatches,
and the moulting hinders them from another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"There are females which never lay at all, and
are called <HI>brehaignes</HI> (barren); others lay only once or twice in the
whole year, and even repose two or three days between the first and
second egg. Others have only three hatches, which are regular,
con∣sisting of three eggs laid without interruption. A fourth sort,
called the <HI>common,</HI> because the most numerous, may have four
hatches of four or five eggs, but not always uniform. Others are still better
layers, having five hatches, and still more if allowed; and in each of
these are six or seven eggs. When this kind feed well, they are
excellent, and we cannot be too careful of them, for they are worth half a
dozen of the ordinary Canaries." 
<BIBL><HI>Traité des Serins des
Canaries.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Some however sit even during moulting, if
they happen to be laying before that season. The birds of the same hatch
do not all moult at the same time. The weakest first drop their feathers,
and the strongest more than a month afterwards. In Jonquil Canaries this
change <PB N="28" REF="41"/> of plumage is tedious, and commonly more dangerous
than in the other kinds. The female Jonquils have only three hatches, each of
three eggs; the flaxen coloured Canaries are too deli∣cate, and their brood
seldom thrives. The Pink shew a reluctance to pair with each other; in a
large volery, the male but rarely couples with the female of his own colour,
and to form the union, they must be confined together in a cage. The white
sort are commonly valuable in every respect; they lay and breed as well, or
rather better than the others, and the variegated white are the hardiest of
all.</P>
<P>Whatever differences there may be in the dis∣positions and
prolific powers of these birds, the period of incubation is the same; all
of them sit thirteen days; and when the exclusion of the young is a day
earlier or later, it is owing to some particular circumstance. Cold retards
the process, and heat forwards it; accordingly the first hatch, which is in
April, requires thirteen days and a half, or even fourteen days, if the weather
is chilly; but the third, which happens during the heats of July and August,
is effected in twelve days and a half, or even twelve days. It would be proper
to separate all the good eggs from the bad; and, to do this with certainty,
we ought to wait to the eighth or ninth day, and take each gently by the two
ends for fear of break∣ing it, and examine it in a strong light, or by a
candle, and reject all that are addle, which if left <PB N="29" REF="42"/> would
only fatigue the hen. By this trial we may often reduce three hatches to two;
and in that case the third female may be liberated, and permitted to begin a
second nest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> When the eggs of one female are set
under another, they must be all sound. If addle or tainted eggs be given
the variegated fe∣males, they will throw them out of the nest; and if the
nest is too deep to admit their being tumbled out, they peck them till
broken, which often spoils the nest, and frustrates the whole hatch.
Fe∣males of other colours cover wind eggs when placed under them. 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Father</HI>
BOUGOT.</BIBL></NOTE>. A plan strongly recommended by bird-fanciers is to
re∣move the eggs as they are dropt, and to substi∣tute in their stead
eggs of ivory; so that after the laying is over, the real eggs are
restored, and all hatch at the same time. Commonly the egg is dropt at
six or seven o'clock in the morn∣ing, and it is said that if it be a
single hour later the bird is sick; and, as the laying proceeds thus
regularly, it is easy to remove the eggs as fast as they are excluded<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The laying is always at the same hour, if the
female is healthy; however, the last egg must be excepted, which is
commonly seve∣ral hours later, and often a day. This last egg is always
smaller than the rest; and I am told that it always gives a cock-bird. It
would be curious to ascertain this singular fact.</NOTE>. But this
precaution is more suited to the convenience of man than consonant to the
train of Nature. When five of six young are hatched at once, they exhaust
the vigour of the mother, and rather damp her spirits; but if they appear
successively, they repeatedly renew her pleasure, and inspire new
courage to dis∣charge her duty. Intelligent persons who have 
<PB N="30" REF="43"/> had experience in breeding these birds assure me,
that they always succeed best when they do not employ this artificial
expedient.</P>
<P>We may assert that, in general, all the nice precautions,
and the refined manoeuvres recom∣mended by writers for training the Canaries,
are pernicious rather than useful; and that in every respect we ought as
much as possible to copy Nature. In their native country they haunt the
sides of small rivulets, or wet gullies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Canary
Finches imported into England are bred in the <HI>barancos,</HI> or gullies
formed by the torrents from the mountains. 
<BIBL><HI>Hist. Gen. des Voyages.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; we
ought therefore to give them plenty of water, both for drinking and bathing. As
they belong to an exceedingly mild climate, they must be sheltered from the
rigours of winter. It appears indeed that being long naturalized in France,
they can bear the cold of that country; for they may be kept in a chamber
without a fire, and even without a glass-window, a wire-grate to prevent
their escape being sufficient; several dealers in birds have informed me
that they lost fewer in this way than when the rooms were heated by a fire.
The same may be said of their food, which is probably the more suited to
them the simpler it is<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>I have often observed from my own experience, and from
that of others who adhered scrupulously to all the minute directions given
by authors, that extreme care and attention often killed their birds. A regular
diet of rape-seed and millet, water every day in winter, and once or twice
a-day in summer; groundsel, when it is to be had, in the month of May;
chickweed in the time of moulting, and instead of sugar, bruised oats and
Turkey wheat, and above all great cleanliness, areall that I would recommend.
<HI>Small Tract on the Breeding of Canaries, communicated by M. Batteau,
Advocate at Dijoz.</HI></P> 
<P>N. B. I must here correct a small error. All the
bird-catchers whom I have consulted tell me, that we ought to avoid giving
them chickweed in the time of moulting, for it is too cooling, and would
protract their state of indisposition. The other directions of Bat∣reau
seem to me well founded.</P></NOTE>. A circumstance that requires 
<PB N="31" REF="44"/> the most attention is not to hasten their first
hatch; it is common to allow them to couple about the twentieth or twenty-fifth
of March, but it would be better to wait till the twelfth or fifteenth of
April; for if the season be cold, they are apt to contract a disgust to
each other; and if the females happen to have eggs, they aban∣don them, at
least till the weather grows warm: and thus a whole hatch is lost in
attempting to accelerate the breeding.</P>
<P>The young Canaries differ from the old ones, both in the colour
of their plumage, and in some other circumstances. 
<Q REND="inline">"A young Canary of the same year (observed
on the thirteenth of Decem∣ber 1772<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Note
communicated by <HI>M. Gucneau de Montbeillard.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>) had its
head, its neck, its back, and the quills of the wings blackish, except the
four first quills of the left wing, and the six first of the right, which
were whitish; the rump, the coverts of the wings, the tail, which was not
entirely formed, and the under part of the body, were also of a whitish
colour; and there were as yet no feathers on the belly from the
<HI>sternum</HI> to the <PB N="32" REF="45"/> <HI>anus.</HI> The lower
mandible was impressed into the upper, which was thick, and somewhat
in∣curvated."</Q> As the bird grows up, the arrange∣ment, and the shades of
colour, change; the old ones can be distinguished from the young by their
strength, their plumage, and their song; the tints are deeper, and more
lively; their toes are rougher, and incline more on black, if they are of the
gray kind; their nails are also thicker, and longer than those of the young
ones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Amusemens Innocens, p. 61 &amp;
62.</BIBL></NOTE>. The female is often so like the male that they cannot at
first be distinguished; however, the colours are always deeper in the
male, the head rather thicker and longer, and the temples of a yellow, more
inclined to orange; and under the bill there is a sort of yellow flame which
descends lower than in the female; its legs are also stronger; and
lastly, it begins to warble almost as soon as it is able to feed by
itself. It is true that some females chant at that tender age with almost
as much spirit as the males: but, joining all these marks together, we may
be able even before the first month to decide which are males or females;
after that time there is no more uncertainty in that respect, for the song
of the males then begins to betray their sex.</P>
<P>Every sudden utterance of sound is in ani∣mals an obvious
sign of passion; and as love is of all the inward feelings that which the
oftenest, <PB N="33" REF="46"/> and the most forcibly agitates the frame,
the ar∣dor is constantly marked by the expression of the voice. The birds
by their song, the bull by his lowing, the horse by his neighing, the bear
by his loud murmur, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all announce the work∣ing of the same
desire. The appetite is much calmer in the female than in the male, and
ac∣cordingly it is but seldom expressed by the voice. The chant of the
hen Canary is only a feeble tone of tender satisfaction, a coy assent to
the warm applications of her mate, and inspired by the eloquence of his
warble; but when this pas∣sion is once excited in her veins, it becomes
ne∣cessary to her existence; and if she be parted from her lover, she
sickens and dies.</P>
<P>It seldom happens that the Canaries bred in a chamber are
indisposed before laying; some males only exhaust their vigour, and
fall victims to the ardor of passion. If the female becomes sick while
hatching, her eggs must be taken from her, and given to another; for though
she recovers soon, she would not sit on them again. The first
symptom of bad health, espe∣cially in the males, is sadness; as soon
as they lose their natural cheerfulness, they ought to be put alone in a
cage, and set in the sun in the chamber where the female is lodged. If he
be∣comes bloated, we must notice if there be a pimple below his tail; when
this pimple is ripe and white, the bird itself often pierces it with the
bill; but if the suppuration advances too <PB N="34" REF="47"/> slowly, we
may discharge it with a large needle, and then fill the wound with spittle
without salt, which would be too smarting. Next day the patient should be
let loose in the chamber, and it will be easy to perceive by his treatment
of the female, and the fondness that he shews, whether he is cured or not.
In this last case, we must take him again, and blow through a small
quill some white wine under his wings, place him in the sun, and notice
next day the state of his health. If he still continue deject∣ed, and
indifferent to his female, his recovery is now almost desperate; we must
remove him into a separate cage, and give the hen another male like the one
she has lost; or if such can∣not be had, we must seek one of the
same species at least. A greater fondness commonly subsists
between those that resemble each other, except in the case of the Pink
Canaries, which prefer the females of a different colour; but this new male
must not be a novice in love, and conse∣quently must have already
raised a hatch. If the female falls sick, the same treatment may be
used.</P>
<P>The most common cause of distempers is the too great
plenty, or richness of food. When these birds make their nests in a cage,
they often eat to excess, or select the nutritious aliments intended for
their young; and most of them sicken from repletion, or inflammation. If
they be kept in a chamber, this danger is in a great <PB N="35" REF="48"/>
measure removed, their numbers preventing their gluttony. A male which sits
too long, is sure of being beat by the other males; and the same is the
case with the females. These quarrels give them exercise, and
necessarily produce tempe∣rance; and for this reason chiefly it is that
they seldom are ever sick in a chamber during the time of breeding: their
infirmities and diseases appear only after they have hatched; most of
them have first the pimple which I have men∣tioned, and then they all undergo
the moulting. Some support well this metamorphosis, and still sing a
part of the day; but most of them lose their voice, and a few languish
and die. After the females are six or seven years old, many of them die in
changing their plumage; the males recover better from the attendant
sickness, and survive their mates three or four years. Indeed we must
consider moulting as the regular pro∣cess of Nature, rather than as an
accidental dis∣temper; and if these birds were not reduced by us to
captivity, and rendered delicate by our treatment, they would suffer only a
slight indis∣position, and would spontaneously discover the proper
remedies: but at present it is a grievous sickness, often fatal, and
which besides admits of few remedies; it is however the less dangerous the
earlier it happens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> In the time of moulting, a bit of steel, and not of iron,
should be put in their water, and changed thrice a-week. No other re∣medies
are needed, though Hervieux reckons several; only during this critical
period, a rather larger portion of hemp-seed should be mixed with their
usual food. 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Father</HI> BOUGOT.</BIBL></P>

<P>Observe that steel is recommended instead of iron,
only lest the iron should be rusty, in which case it would be more
pernicious than usesul.</P></NOTE>. The young Canaries <PB N="36" REF="49"/>
drop their feathers the first year six weeks after they are hatched; they
become low-spirited, appear bloated, and conceal the head in their plumage;
at this time the down only falls; but the following year they lose the
quills, even those of the wings, and of the tail. The young birds of the
later hatches which happen in Sep∣tember or after, suffer much more from the
moulting, than those which are excluded in the spring; in that delicate
condition the cold is extremely pernicious, and they would all perish if not
kept where it is temperate, or even pretty warm. As long as the moulting
lasts, that is six weeks or two months, Nature labours at the production of
new feathers; and the organic molecules, which were before directed to the
supply of the seminal liquor, are now absorbed in this growth; and hence
the exuberance of life being diverted into different channels, their ardor
ceases, and the business of propagation is for the time
suspended.</P>
<P>The most fatal and the most common distem∣per,
especially in young Canaries, is what is called the <HI>swallow
(avalure),</HI> in which the bowels seem to be <HI>swallowed,</HI> and
drawn to the extremity of their body; the intestines are per∣ceived 
<PB N="37" REF="50"/> through the skin of the belly in the state of
inflammation, redness, and distension; the feathers on that part drop,
the bird pines, gives over eating, though always sitting beside the food,
and dies in a few days. The source of the disease is the excessive
abundance or richness of the aliments. All remedies are vain; and the change
of regimen is the only thing which can recover a few out of a great number. The
bird is put into a separate cage, and given water and lettuce seeds; thus
the heat that consumes it is tempered, and evacuations are sometimes
per∣formed which save its life. This distemper also is the fruit of their
artificial education, for it sel∣dom attacks those which are trained by
their pa∣rents; we ought therefore to take the greatest care not to overfeed
them with the stick; boiled rape-seed, and some chickweed, are proper,
but no sugar or biscuit; and in general we should give them too little
rather than too much.</P>
<P>When the Canary utters a frequent feeble cry, which seems to
come from the bottom of its breast, it is said to be asthmatic; it is
also subject to a certain obstruction of voice, espe∣cially after
moulting. This sort of asthma is cured by giving it the seeds of
plantain, and hard biscuit soaked in white wine; and to restore its voice
it ought to have generous food, such as yolks of eggs beat up with crumbs of
bread; and for drink, liquorice-water, that is water in which that root has
been steeped and boiled.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="51"/> The Canaries are also subject to a
sort of shanker on the bill. This disorder is owing to the same cause
with the <HI>swallow,</HI> the abundance or richness of food producing an
inflammation, which, instead of affecting the intestines, some∣times
extends to the throat or palate; the same cooling remedies must be applied;
they should be given lettuce-seeds, and bruised melon-seeds mixed with
their drink.</P>
<P>The mites and the scab with which these small birds are
sometimes affected are generally owing to the dirtiness with which they are
kept. Care must be taken to preserve them clean, to give them water to
bathe in, to avoid putting old or bad wood in their cages, and to cover them
only with new cloth that is not moth-eaten; and the seeds and herbs with
which they are to be fed should be fanned and washed. We must pay this
attention, if we would wish them to be neat and healthy. In the state of
na∣ture they would themselves preserve cleanliness; but imprisoned,
they are subject to the loathsome disorders incident to that state:
however, many of these birds, though reduced to the melan∣choly condition of
captivity, are never sick, and in these habit seems to have become a
second nature. In general, the source of their diseases is the heat of
their constitution. They always need water; and if a plate with snow be
placed in the cage, or even in the volery, they will roll in it several times
with expressions of pleasure, <PB N="39" REF="52"/> though in the
coldest weather. This proves that it is rather pernicious than useful to
keep them in very hot places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> These birds require not
to be kept in a warm place, as many pretend; in the most intense colds they
welter in snow, when present∣ed them on a plate. For my own part, I have
them in a chamber in winter with only an iron-grating, and the windows open;
they sing admirably, and I never lose any. 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Father</HI>
BOUGOT.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there is another distemper to which the Canaries and many
other birds are subject<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Jays, the
Goldfinches, all the Parrots, and the largest Aras.</NOTE>, es∣pecially in
the state of confinement: this is the epilepsy. The yellow Canaries in
particular are oftener than the others seized with the falling sickness,
which attacks them suddenly, and even surprises them in the midst of
their most im∣passioned warble. It is said that they must not be
touched the moment they fall, but must be watched till they discharge a
drop of blood from the bill, and that they may be then lifted up, and will
recover themselves, and in a short time resume their senses and their
life: that it is ne∣cessary to wait till Nature makes that salutary
effort which is announced by the expression of the drop of blood, and that
if handled prema∣turely, the violence of agitation would bring on instant
death. It is to be wished that this ob∣servation were ascertained, some
circumstances in which appear to me rather doubtful. Certain it is, that if
they escape the first attack of this <PB N="40" REF="53"/> epilepsy, they
live a long time after, and some∣times attain the same age with those
which have never been affected by that distemper. How∣ever, I am inclined to
think, that a small inci∣sion in the toes would be beneficial, for in that
way Parrots are cured of the epilepsy.</P>
<P>What miseries in the train of slavery! Would these birds,
if they enjoyed their native free∣dom, be asthmatic, scabby, and
epileptical? Would they be afflicted by inflammations, abscesses, and
shankers? and the most melancholy of disorders, what is produced by the
craving of unsatisfied lust, is it not common to all beings reduced to
captivity? In particular, the females, whose seelings are so nice and
so tender, are more sub∣ject to it than the males. It has been observed,
that after the hen Canary falls sick in the spring before pairing, she
shrinks, languishes, and dies. The amorous passion is awakened by the
singing of the males around her, while she has at the same time no
opportunity of gratification. The males, though they first feel libidinous
desires, and always appear more ardent, support better the languor of
celibacy; they seldom die of continence, but they are often killed by
ex∣cessive venery.</P>
<P>The hen Canaries can, like the females of other birds, lay eggs
without commerce with the male. The egg in itself is, as we have elsewhere
ob∣served, only a matrix which the bird excludes, and will remain unprolific,
if not impregnated <PB N="41" REF="54"/> with the seed of the male; and the
heat of in∣cubation, instead of quickening it, only hastens its
putrefaction. It has also been remarked that if the females be entirely
separated from the males, so as not to see and hear them, they very
seldom lay; and that they oftenest drop their eggs, when melted by the view
or the song of the males: so much do even distant objects act upon
feeling animals, and so many are the ways in which the subtile flame of
love is commu∣nicated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We shall here mention two facts
to which we were witness. A female sung so well, that she was taken for
a male, and paired with another female; the oversight being afterwards
discovered, a male was given to her, who taught her the proper functions of
her sex; she took to laying and renounced her song. The other fact is
that of a female, alive at present, that chants or rather whistles a tune,
though she has laid two eggs in her cage, which are found to be addle, as all
those are which hens lay without the commerce of a cock.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>I cannot better close this article, than by an abstract of a
Letter of the honourable Daines Barrington, Vice President of the Royal

<Q> 
<P>"Most people who keep Canary birds do not know that they
sing chiefly either the Titlark or Nightingale notes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>I once saw two or three birds which came from the Canary I
slands, neither of which had any song at all; and I have been insormed,
that a ship brought a great many of them not long since, which sung as

<P>Most of the Canary birds which are imported from Tyrol,
have been educated by parents, the progenitor of which was instructed by a
Nightingale; our English Canary birds have commonly more of the Titlark

<P>The traffic in these birds makes a small article of
commerce, as four Tyroleze generally bring over to England 1600 every year; and
though they carry them on their backs one thousand miles, as well as pay
twenty pounds duty for such a number, yet upon the whole it answers to
sell these birds at five shillings a∣piece.</P>

<HEAD>FOREIGN BIRDS, THAT ARE RELATED TO THE CANARIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE foreign birds which may be referred to the Canary, are few
in number; we are acquainted with only three species. The first is that
which was sent to us from the eastern coast of Africa, under the name of
<HI>the Mozambique Canary,</HI> which seems to be a shade between the
Canaries and the Siskins. It is delineated <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 364, Fig. 1.
and 2. Yellow is the prevailing colour of the lower part of the body, and brown
that of the upper, except the rump and the coverts of the tail, which are
yellow: these coverts, as well as those of the wings and their quills, are
edged with white or whitish. The same yellow and brown occur on the head,
distributed in alternate bars; that which stretches over the top of the
head is brown, next two yellow ones over the eyes, then two brown ones which
rise behind the eyes, after these two yel∣low ones, and last of all two
brown ones, which extend from the corners of the bill. This bird is rather
smaller than those from the Canary Islands; its length from the tip of
the bill to the end of the tail is about four inches and a half, that of the
tail is only about an inch. The <PB N="44" REF="57"/> female differs very little
from the male, either in size or in colour. This bird is perhaps the same
with that of Madagascar, mentioned by Flaccourt under the name of
<HI>Mangoiche,</HI> which he says is a species of Canary.</P>
<P>It is likely that this bird, which in its plumage resembles
much our variegated Canaries, was their progenitor; and that the entire
species be∣longs only to the ancient continent, and to the Canary Islands,
which may be considered as ad∣jacent to the mainland: for the one mentioned
by Brisson under the name of <HI>the Jamaica Ca∣nary,</HI> and of which
Sloane and Ray have given a short description<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Bird like the <HI>Serin,</HI> variegated
with cinereous, dilute, yellow, and dusky colours."</Q> Its extreme length is
eight inches, its alar ex∣tent is twelve inches, the bill short and strong,
three-fourths of an inch long (or one-third according to Ray), the tail one
inch, the leg and foot one inch and one-fourth. (Brisson suspects that
Sloane is mistaken in his measures, for the proportions are not
consistent.) The upper mandible brown bordering on blue, the lower lighter
coloured; the head and the throat gray; the upper part of the body of a
yellow-brown, the wings and the tail of a deep brown, radiated with white, the
breast and belly yellow, the under part of the tail white, the feet bluish,
the nails brown, hooked, and very short. 
<BIBL>SLOANE's <HI>Jamaica.</HI></BIBL></P> 
<P>It is the <HI>Fringilla Cana</HI> of Linnaeus, and
<HI>Gray-headed Finch</HI> of Latham: Its specisic character:— 
<Q REND="inline">"It is dusky yellow above, below yellow,
its head and throat gray, its vent white, its wings and tail dusky, with
white lines."</Q></P></NOTE>, appears to me to be widely different from our
Canaries, which are not found at all in America. Historians and travellers
in∣form us, that none were originally in Peru, and that the first Canary was
introduced there in 1556, and that the spreading of these birds in 
<PB N="45" REF="58"/> America, and especially in the Antilles, was long
posterior to that date. Father du Tertre relates that du Parquet, in 1657,
bought of a merchant who touched at these islands, a great number of real
Canaries, which he set at liberty; since which time they were heard
warbling about his house; so that it is probable that they have multiplied
in that country. If true Canaries be found in Jamaica, they may have been
de∣scended from those transported to the Antilles, and naturalized there
in the year 1657. How∣ever, the bird described by Sloane, Ray, and
Brisson, by the appellation of <HI>Jamaica Canary,</HI> appears to differ
too much from the natives of the Fortunate islands, to be supposed to
have origi∣nated from those transplanted into the Antilles.</P>
<P>While this article was at the press, we re∣ceived several
Canaries from the Cape of Good Hope, among which I have perceived three males,
one female, and a young one of the same year. These males are very like the
Green Canary of Provence; they differ in being somewhat larger, and their
bills being proportionally thick∣er: their wings are also better variegated,
the quills of the tail edged with a distinct yellow, and they have no yellow
on the rump.</P>
<P>In the young Canary, the colours were still fainter and less
marked than in the female.</P>
<P>But whatever small differences exist, I am still the more
confirmed that the variegated <PB N="46" REF="59"/> Canaries of the Cape of
Mozambique<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears that the Mozambique Canary is not
confined ex∣clusively to that region. I have found among the drawings of
Commerson a coloured figure of this bird very distinctly marked.
Commerson calls it the Cape Canary, and informs us that it had been carried
to the Isle of France, where it was naturalized, and even greatly multiplied,
and was known there by the name of <HI>the Bird of the Cape.</HI> We may expect
to find in the same manner at Mo∣zambique, and in some other countries of
Africa, the variegated Canaries of the Cape, perhaps even those from the
Fortunate Islands, and probably many other varieties of this
species.</NOTE>, of Provence, and of Italy, are all derived from the same
common source, and that they belong to one species, which is spread, and
settled in all the climates of the ancient continent suited to its
constitution, from Provence and Italy to the Cape of Good Hope, and the
adjacent islands. Only this bird has assumed more of the green tint in
Provence, more of the gray in Italy, more of the brown or variegated colour at
the Cape of Good Hope, and seems by the variety of its plumage to point at
the influence of a dif∣ferent climate.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The WORABEE.</HEAD>
<P>The second species which appears to us to be the nearest
related to the Canaries, is a small Abyssinian bird<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Fringilla Abyssinica</HI> of Gmelin, and the
<HI>Black-collared Finch</HI> of Latham. Specisic character:— 
<Q REND="inline">"It is black, yel∣low above, its collar
black, its vent yellow."</Q></NOTE>, of which we have seen 
<PB N="47" REF="60"/> the figure excellently delineated and coloured by Mr.
Bruce, under the appellation of the Wora∣bée of Abyssinia.</P>
<P>This small bird presents not only the colours of certain
varieties of the Canary, the yellow and the black, but it has the same bulk
nearly; and except its being rather rounder, the same shape. Its bill is
also similar, and it prefers an oily seed as the Canary does millet and
panic. But the Warabée has an exclusive pre∣dilection for a plant that
bears the oily seed which I have mentioned, and which is called
<HI>Nuk</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The flower of this plant is yellow, and of
the shape of a cres∣cent; the stalk rises only two or three inches.
From the seed an oil is extracted, which is much used by the monks of that
country.</NOTE> in the Abyssinian language; it never wanders far from that
plant, and seldom loses sight of it.</P>
<P>In the Warabée, the sides of the head, as far as
below the eyes, the throat, the fore-part of the neck, the breast, and the
top of the belly to the legs, are black; the upper-part of the head and all the
body and the lower belly, are yellow, except a kind of black collar, which
encircles the neck behind, and is set off by the yellow. The coverts and the
quills of the wings are black, edged with a lighter colour; the feathers of the
tail are also black, but with a greenish yellow border; the bill likewise
is black, and the legs of a light brown. This bird keeps in <PB N="48" REF="61"/> flocks, but we know nothing more in regard to its mode of life.</P>

</LIST></HEAD>
<P>The third species also of these Foreign Birds, which are
related to the Canary, is known to us from the drawings of Mr. Bruce. I call
this Abyssinian bird <HI>the Ultra-Marine,</HI> because its plumage is of
a fine deep blue. In the first year this beautiful colour does not exist,
and the plumage is gray as that of the Sky-lark, and this gray always continues
in the female, but the males assume the charming blue the second year,
before the vernal equinox.</P>
<P>These birds have a white bill and red legs. They are common
in Abyssinia, and never change their habitation. They are nearly of the
bulk of the Canaries, but their head is round; their wings extend beyond the
middle of the tail. Their warble is very pleasant, and this circumstance
seems the more to point out their relation to our Canaries.</P>

<HEAD>The HABESH of SYRIA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Fringilla
Syriaca</HI> of Gmelin, and the <HI>Tripoline Finch</HI> of
Latham.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Bruce supposes this bird to be a species of Linnet,
and I ought to pay deference to the opinion of so good an observer; but
that gentleman having figured it with a thick short bill, very like that of
the Canaries, I have ven∣tured to place it between the Canaries and
Linnets.</P>
<P>The upper-part of its head is of a fine bright red; the cheeks,
the throat, and the upper-part of the neck are a mottled blackish brown; the
rest of the neck, the breast, the upper-part of the body, and the small
coverts of the wings, variegated with brown, yellow, and blackish; the great
coverts of the wings of a deep ash, edged with a lighter colour; the quills
of the tail and the great quills of the wings also cine∣reous, bordered on
the outside with a bright orange; the belly and the under-part of the tail,
dirty white, with obscure yellowish and blackish spots; the bill and
legs of a leaden colour. The wings reach as far as the middle of the tail,
which is forked.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="63"/> The Habesh is thicker than our Linnet;
its body is also fuller, and it sings prettily. It is a bird of
passage; but Mr. Bruce cannot trace its route, and he assures me, that
in the course of his travels he never saw it except at Tripoli in
Syria.</P>

<P>NATURE herself seems to have assigned these birds a
place next after the Canaries; for their mutual commerce succeeds better than
the intercourse of either with any other contiguous species; and what
points out the closeness of this relation, the progeny is prolific<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This observation was communicated by Daubenton the
younger. Frisch assures us, that pairing a Vine Linnet (Redpole) with a
white hen Canary, that was in the habit of coming abroad every day and
returning to its roost, it made its nest and laid its eggs in a
neighbouring bush, and when the young were hatched, it brought them to the
window of the house. He adds, that this cross-breed had the whole plumage
of the mother, and the red spots of the father, especially on the
head.</NOTE>, especially when a male Linnet is joined with a female
Canary.</P>
<P>Few birds are so common as the Linnet, but still fewer
perhaps unite so many amiable quali∣ties: a pleasant warble, a rich
plumage, docility of disposition, susceptibility of attachment;
pos∣sessing whatever, in short, could invite the attention of man,
and contribute to his delight. Endowed with such talents, it could not long
preserve its freedom; and still less, when nursed in the bosom of
slavery, could it retain un∣sullied <PB N="52" REF="66"/> the beauties of
its original purity. In fact, the charming red colour with which Na∣ture has
painted its head and breast, and which in the state of liberty sparkles
with durable lustre, wears off by degrees, and soon disap∣pears entirely
in our cages and voleries. There remain only a few obscure vestiges after
the first moulting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The red of the head changes into a
rusty-brown varied with blackish, and that of the breast passes into
nearly the same colour; but the new shades are not so deep. An
<HI>amateur</HI> told me, that he has raised some of these Linnets which
preserved the red: this fact stands single.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to the change effected in its song, we
substitute for the free and varied modulations which spring and love
inspire, the strained notes of a harsh music, which they repeat but
imper∣fectly, and which has neither the beauties of art nor the charms of
nature. Some have also succeeded in teaching it to speak different
lan∣guages, that is to whistle some Italian, French, and English words,
&amp;c. and sometimes even to pronounce these with considerable fluency.
Many persons have from curiosity gone from London to Kensington merely to
hear an apo∣thecary's Linnet, which articulated the words <HI>pretty boy.</HI>
The fact is, it had been taken out of the nest when only two or three days
old, before it had time to acquire the parent song; and just beginning to
listen with attention, it was struck with the sound of <HI>pretty
boy,</HI> and learned it from <PB N="53" REF="67"/> imitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>A goldfinch which was taken from the nest two or three
days after hatching, and set in a window that looked into a garden where the
wrens resorted, caught their song, and had not a single note of its own
species.</P> 
<P>A sparrow was taken from the nest when it was fledged,
and educated under a Linnet; but hearing by accident a goldfinch, its song
was a mixture of that of the Linnet and the goldfinch.</P> 
<P>A robin was set under a very fine nightingale, which began
to be out of song, and in a fortnight was perfectly mute; the robin had
three-parts in four of the nightingale's warble, the rest being a confused
jumble.</P> 
<P>Lastly, Mr. Barrington adds, that the Canaries imported
from Tyrol seem to have been educated by parents the progenitor of which was
instructed by a nightingale; while the Canaries bred in England appear to
have derived their song from the tit-lark. 
<BIBL><HI>Philosoph. Transact. Jan.</HI> 10,
1773.</BIBL></P> 
<P>If we breed a young Linnet with a chaffinch, or nightingale,
says Gesner, it will acquire their song; and particularly that part of
the chaffinch's song that is called the <HI>alarum sound.</HI> 
<BIBL>REITERZU, p. 591.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. This fact,
together with many others, appears to me to establish the opinion of the
Honourable Daines Barrington, that birds have no innate song; and that the
warble peculiar to the different species, and its varieties, have nearly the
same origin with the languages and the dialects of various nations<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The loss of the parent-cock at the critical time
for instruction occasions undoubtedly the varieties in the song of each
species; because then the nestling has either attended to the song of
some other birds, or perhaps invented some notes of its own, which are
perpetuated from generation to generation, till similar accidents pro∣duce
other alterations. The truth is, that scarcely any two birds of the same
species have exactly the same notes, if they are accu∣rately attended to,
though there is a general resemblance. 
<BIBL>BAR∣RINGTON, <HI>Philos. Trans.</HI>
1773.</BIBL></NOTE>. Mr. Barrington tells us, that in experiments of this kind
he pre∣ferred a young cock Linnet of three weeks be∣ginning <PB N="54" REF="68"/> to fly, not only on account of its great facility and talent for
imitation, but be∣cause in that species it is easier to distinguish
the sex; some of the outer-quills of the wings in the male having the
outer-edge white as far as the shaft, while in the female these are only
bor∣dered with that colour.</P>
<P>It follows from the experiments of this learn∣ed gentleman, that
the young Linnets educated by the different kinds of larks, and even by an
African Linnet, called <HI>Vengolina,</HI> of which we shall afterwards
treat, acquired not the song of their parent, but that of their instructor.
Only a few retained the <HI>call</HI> of its species, or the Lin∣nets
<HI>chuckle,</HI> which they had heard of their pa∣rents before they were
parted.</P>
<P>It is extremely doubtful whether our Com∣mon Linnet, called by
some the <HI>Gray Linnet,</HI> is different from that termed the <HI>Vine
Linnet,</HI> or the <HI>Red Linnet:</HI> for, 1. The red spots which
distinguish the males in the Red Linnet are far from being constant,
since, as we have already observed, they become obliterated in
confine∣ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Of four cock Linnets, which were consequently red, brought
to me on the twelfth of July, I exposed one to the open air, and set three
in a chamber, two of which were shut up in the same cage. The red on the
head of the latter began to disappear by the twenty-eighth of August, and
also that on the lower part of the breast. On the eighth of September one
of the two was found dead; its head was entirely divested of feathers, and
even slightly wounded. I dis∣covered that the one had fought the other
after the moulting, as if their acquaintance was dissolved by the
disguise of plumage. The red of the head of the vanquished Linnet no
longer existed, for all the feathers had dropped, and that of the breast
was more than half effaced.</P> 
<P>The third which was shut up was very late in moulting, and
retained its red till that time. The one that was kept in the open air made its
escape at the end of three months; but it had already lost all its
red.—It follows from this experiment, that either the open air hastens
the disappearance of the red, by advancing the moulting; or that the want of
fresh air has a smaller share in the change of plumage in these birds
than the loss of liberty.</P></NOTE>. 2. They are not a discriminating
cha∣racter, <PB N="55" REF="69"/> as traces of them are to be found in the bird
described to be the male of the Gray Lin∣net, where the feathers on the
breast are of a dull red in their middle. 3. The moulting tar∣nishes, and
for a time almost discharges this red, which recovers not its lustre till
the fine wea∣ther, but from the end of September colours the middle of the
feathers on the breast, as in that reckoned by Brisson a common cock
Linnet. 4. Gesner at Turin, Olina at Rome, Linnaeus at Stockholm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No mention is made of the Gray Linnet in the <HI>Fauna
Suecica.</HI> Klein speaks of one Zarn, author of a letter on the birds of
Ger∣many, where he endeavours to prove that there is only one species of
Linnet. I have heard the same assertion of many bird-catchers, who had
never seen the letter; and Hebert, who is certainly a fit judge of the
matter, is of the same opinion.</NOTE>, and Belon in France, have known in
their respective countries only the Red Lin∣nets. 5. Bird-catchers, who have
in France followed that profession more than thirty years, have never found
a single cock Linnet which had not the red shade corresponding to the
sea∣son; and at the same time we see many Gray Linnets in the cage. 6.
Even those who admit <PB N="56" REF="70"/> the existence of Gray Linnets in
the state of nature agree, that they are scarcely ever caught, particularly
in summer, which they attribute to their shy disposition. 7. Add to all
these, that the Red and Gray Linnets are very similar in the rest of
their plumage, in their size, in the proportions and shape of their parts,
in their song, and in their habits. And it will be easy to infer, that if
Gray Linnets really do exist, they are either, 1. all females; or, 2. all
young males of the year's hatch before October, for at that time they begin to
be marked; 3. such as being bred apart from the mothers cannot as∣sume
red in the state of captivity; 4. those which being caught lose their
tint in the cage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We must observe that those birds
which have had the red spots, but lost them, still retain on the same
parts a rufous colour, approaching to red; which never appears in the young
that have been bred without the mothers, and that consequently have never
been marked with red.</NOTE>; or, lastly, those in which this beautiful
colour is effaced by moulting, disease, or some other cause.</P>
<P>The reader will not then be surprised that I refer these
two Linnets to the same identical species; and consider the gray sort
as only an accidental variety, partly effected by education, and afterwards
mistaken by authors.</P>
<P>The Linnet often builds its nest in vineyards, and hence it
has been called the <HI>Vine-Linnet.</HI> Sometimes it places its nest on the
ground; at other times it fixes it between two props, or <PB N="57" REF="71"/>
even in the vine itself; it breeds also in ju∣niper, gooseberry, and
hazel-nut trees, in young copses, &amp;c. A great number of these nests
have been brought to me in the month of May, a few in July, and only one in
September: they were all composed of slender roots, small leaves, and
moss on the outside, and lined with feathers, hairs, and a great deal of
wool. I never found more than six eggs; that of the fourth of Sep∣tember had
only three; they were of a dirty white, spotted with brown red at the large
end. The Linnets have seldom more than two hatches, except their eggs be
robbed, which obliges them to renew their labours; and in this way they may be
made to lay four times in the year. The mother feeds the young by disgorging
into their bill what had been prepared and half-digested in her craw.</P>
<P>After the hatching is over, and the family raised, the Linnets
go in numerous flocks, which are formed about the end of August, when the
hemp is arrived at maturity; and at this time sixty have been caught in one
drawing of the net<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lark-net may be used, but it
ought to be rather smaller and closer. One or two cock Linnets should be
had for calls. Chaffinches, and other small birds, are often caught with the
Lin∣nets.</NOTE>, and out of these were forty males. They continue to live
thus in society during the whole winter; they fly very crowded, alight and
rise together, perch on the same trees, and about the <PB N="58" REF="72"/>
beginning of spring they all chant at once; they lodge during the night in
oaks, and elms, whose leaves, though dry, have not yet fallen; they are
seen too on the linden-trees and pop∣lars, and feed upon the buds; they live
also upon all kinds of small seeds, particularly those of thistles,
&amp;c. and hence they haunt indiscrimi∣nately uncultivated lands, and
ploughed fields. Their walk is a sort of hopping; but their flight is
continued and uniform, and not like that of the sparrow, composed of a
succession of jerks.</P>
<P>The song of the Linnet is announced by a sort of prelude. In
Italy the Linnets of Abruzzo and of the Marche of Ancona are preferred. It is
generally supposed in France that the warble of the Red Linnet is
superior to that of the Gray. This is consonant to reason; for a bird
which has formed its song in the bosom of liberty, and from the impulse
of its inward feelings, must have more affecting and expressive airs,
than one that has no object but only to cheer its languor, or to give the
necessary exercise to its vocal or∣gans.</P>
<P>The females are naturally destitute of song, nor can they
ever acquire it. The adult males caught in the net profit as little by
instruction; and the young males taken out of the nest are alone
susceptible of education. They are fed with oatmeal-gruel, and rape-seed
ground with milk or sugared-water; and in the evening they are whistled to
in the weak light of a candle, <PB N="59" REF="73"/> care being taken to
articulate distinctly the words which they are wanted to repeat. Some∣times,
to begin them, they are held on the fin∣ger before a mirror, in which they view
their image, and believe they see another bird of their own species; they
soon fancy that they hear the notes of a companion, and this illusion
produces a sort of emulation which animates their songs, and quickens their
progress. It is supposed that they sing more in a small cage than in
a large one.</P>
<P>The very name of these birds points out their proper food.
They are called Linnets <HI>(Linariae)</HI> because they prefer lint-seed;
to this are added the seeds of panic, of rape, of hemp, of millet, of
Canary-grass, of raddish, of cabbage, of poppy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner says that if poppy-seeds alone be given for food
either to Linnets or Goldfinches, they will become blind.</NOTE>, of plantain,
of beet, and sometimes those of melon bruised. From time to time they
have sweet cake, prickly-sorrel, chickweed, some ears of wheat, oats
pounded, and even a little salt; but all these must be properly varied.
They break the small grains in their bill, and reject the shell; they ought
to have very little hemp-seed, for it fattens them too much; and this
excessive fat occasions their death, or at least renders them unfit for
singing. In thus feeding and raising them one's self, we shall not only
teach them what airs we chuse with a Canary-whistle, a flageolet, &amp;c.
but we shall tame them. <PB N="60" REF="74"/> Olina advises to shelter
them from cold, and even to employ remedies for their diseases; that we
ought for instance to put in their cage little bits of plaster to prevent
costiveness, to which they are subject: he directs oxymel, succory,
&amp;c. in cases of asthma, phthisic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The captive
Linnets are also subject to the epilepsy, and the boil. Some say that
they can scarcely ever be cured of this boil; others direct to puncture it
seasonably, and pour wine into the wound.</NOTE>, and certain
convulsions, or beatings with the bill. This last, however, I should
suppose, is only a kind of ca∣ressing; the little animal, overcome by
in∣ward workings, makes the most violent efforts to communicate its
sentiments. At any rate we must attend much to the choice and quality of
the grain that is given it, and observe great cleanliness in its food,
drink, and volery; when such care is taken, the bird may live in confine∣ment
five or six years, according to Olina; and much longer according to
others<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is one at Montbeillard that is
certainly known to be seventeen years old.</NOTE>. They dis∣tinguish
those who are kind to them, become fond of them, alight on them out of
preference, and behold them with an affectionate air. If we would abuse their
docility, we might even make them draw water; for they acquire habits as
readily as the Siskin and Goldfinch. They begin to moult about the dog-days,
and sometimes much later: a Linnet and a Siskin have been known not to drop
their feathers be∣fore <PB N="61" REF="75"/> October; they had sung till that
time, and their music was superior to that of any other bird in the same
volery; and their moult, though late in the season, was expeditious and
easy.</P>
<P>The Linnet is a pulverulent bird, and it would be proper to
strew in the bottom of the cage a layer of fine sand, and renew it
occasionally; there ought also to be a small bath.—The total length
of the bird is five inches and a few lines; its alar extent nearly nine inches;
its bill five lines; its tail two inches, somewhat forked, and stretching
an inch beyond the wings.</P>
<P>In the male the top of the head and the breast are red; the
throat, and the under-part of the body, rusty-white; the upper-part,
ches∣nut; almost all the feathers of the tail and of the wings are black,
edged with white; and hence when the wings are closed there is a white ray
parallel to the feathers. The female has commonly none of the red that we have
mentioned; and the plumage is more varied than in the male.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The two kinds of Linnets which Buffon conceives to be
originally the same, are distinguished by systematic
writers:—</P> 
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Common Linnet,</HI> called sometimes the
<HI>Gray Linnet.</HI> It is the <HI>Fringilla Linota</HI> of Gmelin; the
<HI>Linaria</HI> of Ray, Willughby. Brisson, Frisch, &amp;c. The German
name is <HI>Flacks-Finch,</HI> that is <HI>Flax-Finch;</HI> the Italian,
<HI>Fanello;</HI> the Dutch, <HI>Knue;</HI> the Brabantish,
<HI>Vlasvinch;</HI> the Turkish, <HI>Gezogen.</HI> Aristotle termed it
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The character given by
Brisson is:— 
<Q REND="inline">"It is of a dusky chesnut, and beneath
tawny white; its wings are marked by a longitudinal white stripe; its
tail-quills are black, edged with white."</Q> In the beginning of the spring
the breast of the male is of a rose-crim∣son colour, which does not take
place in the female. It builds its nest with moss and bents, and lines it
with wool and hair; lays five eggs.</P> 
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Greater Red-headed Linnet,</HI> or
<HI>Red-Poll,</HI> which Buffon terms <HI>The Greater Vine-Linnet.</HI> It is
the <HI>Fringilla Cannabina</HI> of Linnaeus, or the <HI>Hemp-Finch;</HI> the
<HI>Linaria Rubra</HI> of Gesner, Ray, Brisson, &amp;c. The German name
is <HI>Hänfling,</HI> or <HI>Hemp-bird;</HI> and the Italian <HI>Fanello
Marino,</HI> or <HI>Sea-Linnet.</HI> It is thus characterized by
Brisson:— 
<Q REND="inline">"It is of a dusky-chesnut, the margins
of its fea∣thers more dilute, and beneath of a tawny-white; its wings marked
with a white longitudinal stripe; its tail-quills black, the whole of their
borders white."</Q> The Linnaean character:— 
<Q REND="inline">"The primary quills of its wings, and
those of the tail, black, and white at both the edges."</Q> It is found both
in Europe and in America. It is smaller than the preceding, and is gregarious
in winter. The female has neither the red spot on the crown, nor the
blush-coloured breast. It nestles on the ground. It is a very fa∣miliar
bird, and quite cheerful a few minutes after it is caught.</P> 
<P>The opinion of our ingenious author with respect to the
identity of the species of the Red Poll, and of the Common Linnet, is very
plausible; but it seems not altogether well founded. The Red Poll is
smaller than the Linnet; it nestles on the ground, while the latter breeds
in furze and thorn-hedges. The egg of the Linnet is of a very faint blue,
dotted with rusty specks, and interspersed with mi∣nute brown
streaks. The egg of the Red Poll is a very faint green, sprinkled with
rusty dots, and rather sharp at the small end.</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the LINNET.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE WHITE LINNET. I have seen this variety at the
house of Desmoulin, the painter. White was the predominant colour of its
plu∣mage, but the quills of the wings and of the tail were black, edged with
white, as the Com∣mon Linnet, and some vestiges of gray also were
perceptible on the upper coverts of the wings.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE BLACK-LEGGED LINNET. Its bill is greenish, and
the tail much forked; in other respects, it is the same in size, in
proportions, and even in colours, with the common Linnet. This bird is found in

<P>Little is known with regard to this bird, yet enough to
indicate its affinity to the Linnet. It <PB N="64" REF="78"/> is of the same
size, it feeds upon the same seeds, it flies also in numerous flocks,
and has eggs of the same colour: its tail is forked, the upper-part of its
body of a deep brown, the breast rufous, speckled with brown, and the belly
white. It lays indeed three or four eggs only, according to Gesner, and its
legs are red. But was Gesner accurately ac∣quainted with the number of eggs?
and with regard to the red colour of the legs, we have seen, and we shall
have other oppor∣tunities of being convinced, that this property is far from
being foreign to Linnets, especially to those in their natural state. The
analogy appears even amidst the differences, and I am inclined to believe,
that when the Strasburg Finch is better known, it may be referred as a
variety derived from climate, situation, &amp;c. to the common Linnet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Specific character:—

Linnet)?</HI></NOTE>: it is larger than the ordinary sort, and its bill
proportionally more slender. The red, which appears on the head and breast
of the common cock Linnet, occurs in the male of this species on the rump. In
other respects the plumage is nearly the same. The breast and throat are
variegated with black and white; the head with black and cinereous, and the
back with black and rusty. The wings have a transverse white ray, which
is very dis∣tinct, being on a black ground; it is formed by the great coverts

<P>It is probable that the Mountain Linnet has a forked tail, and
that its warble is pleasant, though <PB N="66" REF="80"/> Willughby does not

variety resulting from climate or situation.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The

<P>When we treat of birds whose colours are so variable as in
the present, we should fall into numberless mistakes, if we
considered them as specific characters. We have already seen that 
<PB N="67" REF="81"/> the common Linnet, in the state of liberty, was marked
with red on the head and breast; that the captive Linnet had the same
colour only on the breast, and that concealed; that the Stras∣burg Linnet
had it on the legs; and that the Mountain Linnet was painted with it on the
rump. Brisson says, that what he calls the Lit∣tle Vine Linnet is red on
the head and breast; and Gesner adds, on the rump. Willughby mentions a
small Linnet which had a red spot on the head, and in that circumstance
resembled the two described by Aldrovandus, though it differed in other
respects. Lastly, the <HI>Cabaret</HI> of Brisson was marked with red
on the head and rump, but that of Frisch had none on the head. It is obvious,
that a great part of these varieties is owing to the seasons and the
circumstances in which these birds have been seen. If in the middle of
spring, they were clothed in their richest colours; if during the moulting
season, the red had disappeared; if immediately after, it was not yet
resumed. If they were kept in a cage, the change would be in proportion to
the length of their confinement; and as the feathers of the different parts of
the body would drop at different times, there would be abundant source of
diversity. In this un∣certainty, we are obliged, in order to determine the
species, to recur to the more permanent pro∣perties; the shape of the body,
the instincts, and habits. Applying this method, I can per∣ceive 
<PB N="68" REF="82"/> only two kinds of birds that have re∣ceived the name of
Little Linnet: the one, which never sings, appears but once in six or
seven years, arrives in numerous flocks, resembles the Siskin, &amp;c.:
it is the Little Vine Linnet of Bris∣son: the other is the Twite of this
article.</P>
<P>The younger Daubenton had for two or three years one of
these birds, which was caught in a net. It was at first very shy, but it
became gradually reconciled, and grew quite familiar. It seemed to prefer
hemp-seed for its food. It had a sweet mellow note, much like that of the
Hedge Petty∣chaps. It lost all its red the first year, and never recovered
it; the other colours suffered no altera∣tion. When sick or in moult, its
bill was ob∣served to become immediately pale and yellowish; and as the
bird recovered, it passed through all the shades to its proper brown
cast. The fe∣male is not entirely destitute of brilliancy of plu∣mage; it
is marked with red on the head, but not on the rump. Though smaller than the
common hen Linnet, its voice is stronger and more varied. This bird is rare
both in Germany and in France. It flies rapidly, but never in large flocks; its
bill is rather more slender in proportion than that of the common Linnet.</P>
<P><HI>Measures:</HI> the total length of the Twite is four
inches and a half; its wings are eight inches across; its bill rather more
than four lines; its tail two inches: this is forked, and projects only eight
lines beyond the wings.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="83"/> <HI>Colours:</HI> The upper-part of the
head and the rump are red; there is a reddish bar under the eyes; the
upper-part of the body is variegated with black and rust colour; the
under-part of the body rusty, spotted with blackish below the throat; the
belly is white; the legs brown, some∣times black. The nails are very long,
and that of the hind toe is longer than the toe itself.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus makes the Twite a variety of the Mountain Lin∣net; but
Mr. Latham conceives it to be more related to the Red Poll. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is variegated above, rufous below, the
abdomen whitish, the eye-brows and the bar on the wings tawny, the crown and
rump red."</Q> It is about four inches and a half long. Brisson describes
it 
<Q REND="inline">"as blackish above and varied with rufous,
below tawny; the belly whitish; the stripe above the eyes ru∣fous; having
spots between the bill and the eyes and under the throat of a dusky
blackish colour, the crown and rump red in the male; (the crown red in the
female;) the transverse bar on the wings of a white-rufous; the tail-quills
dusky, the whole of the edges tawny."</Q> If we were to judge from the egg of
the Twite, we should regard it as a variety of the Red Poll. The egg of the
Twite, though rather smaller than that of the Red Poll, is of the same
shape and colour; only the dots are orange, smaller, and more thickly
spread.</NOTE></P>

<P>ALL that is known with regard to the history of this bird
is, that it is found in the kingdom of Angola; that it is very samiliar; that
it is ranked among the finest warblers of that coun∣try; and that its song
is not the same with that of our Linnet. The neck, the upper-part of the head
and of the body, are variegated with two sorts of brown; the rump has a
beautiful spot of yellow, <PB N="71" REF="85"/> which extends to the quills of
the tail: these quills are brown, edged and tipt with light gray, as also
the quills of the wings, and their great and middle coverts. The sides of the
head are of a light rust colour, and there is a brown streak below the
eyes; the under-part of the body and the sides are spotted with brown on a
lighter ground.</P>
<P>Edwards, who first described this bird, and who has given
a figure of it at the bottom of Pl. 129, is inclined to think it is a female of
another that is represented at the top of the same plate. Thisother bird is
called <HI>Negral</HI> or <HI>Taba∣que,</HI> and its song is much like that
of the Ven∣goline. For my own part, I must confess, that the song<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daines Barrington says, that the Vengoline excels in point
of song all the birds of Asia, Africa, and America, except only the
American Mocking Bird.</NOTE> of this makes me doubt of its being a female. I
should rather suppose that they are two males of the same species,
but from dif∣ferent climates, where each would have a distinct name; or at
least that they are two males of the same climate, one of which being bred
in a volery, had lost the lustre of its plumage, and the other not being
caught before it was adult, or having been kept but a short time in the cage,
had preserved its colours better. In fact the colours of the Negral are
richer and more mark∣ed than those of the Vengoline. The throat, the face,
and the streak below the eyes, are black; <PB N="72" REF="86"/> the cheeks
white, the breast and all the under-part of the body of an orange colour,
without specks, and which assume a deeper shade under the belly and the
tail. These two birds are of the size of our Linnet; and Edwards adds, that
they have the same aspect.</P>

blackish, edged with <PB N="73" REF="87"/> light cinereous, except the

<HEAD>IV. The DUSKY FINCH.</HEAD>
<P>Our knowledge of this bird is drawn from Edwards. Almost all
its feathers are blackish, edged with a lighter colour, which has a reddish
cast on the upper-part of the body: the general colour that results from
this mixture is deep brown, though varied. It has a cinereous tint on the
breast and rump; the bill is also cine∣reous, and the legs are brown.</P>
<P>I presume that Brisson ought not to confound this bird
with <HI>the Little Brown Sparrow</HI> of Cates∣by, whose plumage is of an
uniform brown, without any moulting, and therefore quite dif∣ferent. But the
difference of climate is still greater; for Edwards's Dusky Linnet came
probably from Brazil, perhaps even from Africa; whereas Catesby's <HI>Little
Brown Sparrow</HI> is found in Carolina and Virginia, where it breeds and
continues the whole year. Catesby tells us, that it lives upon insects,
that it is almost always alone, that it is not very common, that it visits
inhabited places, and that it is constantly hop∣ping among the bushes. We

<P>ALL travellers, and after them the naturalists, have agreed,
that these small birds change their colours in moulting. Some even add
interest∣ing particulars which we should wish to ascertain; that the
varieties of plumage are confined entirely to five principal colours, black,
blue, green, yellow, and red; and that the Bengals never assume more than
one at a time. Yet persons who have had an opportunity of observing these
birds in France, and of watching their alterations for a course of years,
assert that they have only one annual moult, and never change their
colour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M. Mauduit, well known for his
enlightened taste in Natural History, and for his excellent collection of
birds, observed a Red Senegal that lived more than a year without changing
his plumage. Château says the same of all the Bengals which
passed through his hands.</NOTE>. This apparent contradiction may be
explained by the difference of climates. That of Asia and Africa, the native
regions of these birds, is more powerful than ours, and may have greater
influence upon their plumage. But the Bengals are not the only birds which
undergo the change; for, according to Merolla, the Sparrow in Africa becomes
red in the rainy season, <PB N="79" REF="93"/> and many others are subject
to similar alterations. At any rate, an arrangement founded on the colours of
the plumage must in the present case be totally uncertain; since, in
their native climate, at least, these pretended characters would only be
momentary, depending on the season when the birds was killed. On the other
hand, their com∣plexion, which fluctuates in Africa and Asia, is invariable
in Europe; and it becomes difficult to avoid compounding varieties with
species. I shall follow therefore the received opinions, and allot a
separate article to each bird which ap∣pears obviously distinct, but
without pretending to decide the number of real species, which can be only
the work of time.</P>
<P>We should be much mistaken if we inferred from the names of
these birds, that they are confined to Bengal and Senegal: they are spread
through the greatest part of Asia and Africa, and even in many of the
adjacent islands, such as those of Madagascar, Bourbon, France, and
Java, &amp;c. We may even expect soon to find them multiplied in America; for
De Sonini lately set at liberty a great number of them in the Isle of
Cayenne, and afterwards saw them cheerful and lively, strongly disposed
to natu∣ralize in a foreign soil, and perpetuate their race<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A few years ago a Red Senegal was killed at Cayenne in a
savanna; it had certainly been carried thither by some navigators.</NOTE>.
We may hope that these new colonists, whose plumage is so variable,
will also suffer the influ∣ence <PB N="80" REF="94"/> of an American
climate, and other varie∣ties will be produced, more fit however to decorate
our cabinets than to enrich Natural History.</P>
<P>The Bengals are familiar and destructive birds: in a word,
they are real Sparrows. They visit the houses and even appear in the middle
of the villages, and alight in numerous bodies in the fields sowed with
millet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travellers insorm us, that the negroes eat
certain small birds entire with their feathers, and these birds resemble
Linnets. I imagine that Senegals are of the number, for some Senegals in the
time of moulting are like Linnets. Besides, it is said that the negroes eat
the small birds entire, only to retaliate for the damage done among their
crops, these nestling in the midst of the sowed fields.</NOTE>; for
they prefer this grain: they are also fond of bathing.</P>
<P>In Senegal, they are caught under a calebash, or large gourd,
which is placed upon the ground, and raised a little by a short prop, to
which a long cord is fastened; a few grains of millet serve for the bait.
The person who watches their motions without being perceived, draws at the
proper time, and secures whatever is under the calebash; Bengals, Senegals,
and small black Sparrows with white bellies, &amp;c.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I owe the detail of this sport to M. de Sonini.</NOTE> These
birds are transported with difficulty, and can hardly be reconciled to a
different climate; but when once naturalized, they live six or seven years,
that is longer than many species proper to the country. They have even bred
in Holland; and the same success would undoubtedly be had 
<PB N="81" REF="95"/> in colder places; for these birds are very gentle and
social, and often caress each other, and above all, the males and females
sit near one another, and sing in concert. It is added, the song of the
female is not much inferior to that of the male.</P>

<P>AS the instincts and habits are nearly the same in the whole
of this family of birds, I shall content myself, in this and the following
articles, to subjoin to the general account, the delinea∣tion of the peculiar
features of each. In cases such as the present, where the principal
object is to convey ideas of the richness and variety of the plumage, we
ought to quit the pen for the pencil; at least, we must imitate the painter
in describing not only the forms and lineaments, <PB N="82" REF="96"/> but in
representing the sportive fluctuation of tints, their changing
succession and combination, and above all in expressing action,
motion, and life.</P>
<P>The Bengal has on each side of its head a sort of purple
crescent which lies under the eyes, and marks the physiognomy of this
little bird.</P>
<P>The throat is light blue, and the same colour spreads over
all the lower parts of the body, as far as the end of the tail, and even over
the upper coverts. All the upper-part of the body, including the wings, is of a
pleasant gray.</P>
<P>In some individuals, this same gray, some∣what lighter, is
the colour of the belly and of the lower coverts of the tail.</P>
<P>In other specimens brought from Abys∣sinia, this gray had
a tinge of red on the belly.</P>
<P>Lastly, in others there is no purple crescent under the
eyes; and this variety, known by the name of <HI>Blue Cord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cordon Bleu,</HI> Knight of the order of the Holy
Ghost.</NOTE>, is more common than that first described. It is said to
be a female; but, as it is so frequent, I should rather suppose that
the appearance is owing to the difference of age or climate. Mr. Bruce, who has
seen this bird in Abyssinia, positively assures us, that the two
red spots are not found in the female, and that all her colours are less
brilliant. He adds, that <PB N="83" REF="97"/> the male has an agreeable warble,
but he never remarked that of the female: in both, the bill and the legs are
reddish.</P>
<P>Edwards has figured and coloured a <HI>Blue Cord (the
Blue-bellied Finch)</HI> which was brought from the coast of Angola, where
the Portuguese called it <HI>Azulinha.</HI> It differed from the preceding;
the upper-part of the body be∣ing of a brown cinereous, slightly tinged with
purple, the bill of a deep flesh colour, and the legs brown. The plumage of
the female was of a cinereous brown, with a flight tinge of blue on the
lower-part of the body only. It would seem to be a variety from the climate,
in which neither sex has the red spot under the eyes; and this accounts for
the frequency of the <HI>Blue Cords.</HI> It is a very lively bird. Ed∣wards
remarks that its bill is like that of the Goldfinch. He takes no notice of its
song, not having an opportunity of hearing it.</P>
<P>The Bengal is of the size of the <HI>Sizerin;</HI> its total
length is four inches nine lines; its bill four lines; its tail two inches,
unequally taper∣ing, and consisting of twelve quills; its extent six or
seven inches.</P>

<HEAD>The BROWN BENGAL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Latham reckons

of the following article. Brisson terms it <HI>Bengalus Fuscus,</HI> or
Dusky Bengal, and describes it as 
<Q REND="inline">"having the throat and breast mixed with
dirty whitish; the upper co∣verts of the wings dotted with white; the quills
blackish."</Q></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>Brown is the predominant colour of this bird; but it is more
intense under the belly, and mot∣tled on the breast, with whitish in
some indivi∣duals, and reddish in others. All the males have some of the
upper coverts of the wings tipt with a white point, which produces a
speckling, con∣fined however to that sex; for the female is of an uniform
brown without spots. In both the bill is reddish, and the legs of a light
yellow.</P>
<P>The Brown Bengal is nearly the size of a wren; its total

<P>Of all the Bengals which I have seen, this is the most
speckled. The whole upper part of the body, the superior coverts of the
tail and wings, and the quills of the wings next the back, were sprinkled
with points; the wings were brown, and the lateral quills of the tail black,
edged with white. Brown mixed with a dull red was spread over all the upper
part of the body, including the coverts of the tail, and even under the belly;
a red not so dusky ex∣tended over all the rest of the under-part of the
body, and the sides of the head; the bill was also of a dull red, and the
legs of a light yellow.</P>
<P>The female, according to Brisson, is never punctured; it
differs also from the male, as its neck, breast, and belly, are of a
pale∣yellow, and the throat white. According to other observers, who had many
opportunities of <PB N="86" REF="101"/> repeatedly seeing these birds alive,
the female was entirely brown, and without spots. Is this a variety of
plumage, or a difference of descrip∣tion? for the latter is no small
source of confu∣sion in natural history. Willughby saw several of
these birds which came from the East Indies, and, as we may expect, found
several differences among the individuals; some had black wings; in others
the breast was of that colour; in others the breast and belly were
blackest; in others the legs whitish: in all the nails were very long, and
more incurvated than those of the lark. There is reason to believe that
some of these birds were in moult; for I observed one in which the
lower-belly was blackish, and all the rest of the plumage indecided, as
happens when the feathers are dropped, the colours pe∣culiar to the species
being impressed, but not well discriminated.</P>
<P>The specimen described by Brisson came from the
island of Java. Those observed by Charle∣ton were brought from India;
their warble was very pleasant; several of them were kept toge∣ther in the
same cage, because they disliked the society of other birds.</P>
<P>The Speckled Bengal is of a size intermediate to the two
preceding; its total length is about four inches; its bill four or five lines;
its extent less than six inches; its tail an inch and four lines, unequally
tapered, and consisting of twelve quills.</P>

<P>I. I have seen one of these birds which had been killed in
Cayenne in a savanna, and the only one that has been seen in that country.
It probably had been carried thither by some curi∣ous person, and had
escaped from its cage. It differed in some respects from the preceding;
the coverts of its wings were slightly edged with red; the bill was entirely
of that colour; the legs only reddish: and what shews the close analogy
between the Bengals and Senegals, the breast and sides were sprinkled
with some white points.</P>

<P>II. The DANBIK of Mr. Bruce. This bird is very common in
Abyssinia, and partakes of the qualities of the two preceding. It is of the
same size. The red colour, which is spread over all the anterior part,
does not descend to the legs, as in the Senegal, but it extends over the
coverts of the wings, where a few white points are per∣ceived likewise on the
sides of the breast. The bill is purple, its upper and lower ridge
bluish, and the legs cinereous. The male sings agree∣ably. The female is of

<P>It is radiated transversely as far as the end of the tail
with brown and gray, and the <HI>striae</HI> are the more delicate as they
are nearer the head. The general complexion is much lighter on the lower part
of the body; it is also shaded with rose-colour, and there is a red
oblong spot under the belly; the lower coverts of the tail are black without
any rays, but some traces can be per∣ceived on the wing-quills, which are
brown; the bill is red, and there is a stripe, or rather a bar of that colour
on the eyes.</P>
<P>I have been assured that the female is exactly like the
male; but the differences which I have myself observed in many individuals,
and those which have been noticed by others, create some 
<PB N="90" REF="105"/> doubts of the perfect similarity of the sexes. I have
seen several which came from the Cape, in some of which the upper-part of
the body was more or less of a deep brown, and the under more or less
reddish; in others the upper-part of the head had no rays. In that figured by
Edwards, Pl. 179, the rays consisted of two browns; and the coverts below
the tail were not black, which is also the case with what we have
represented N<SUP>o</SUP> 157, fig. 2. Lastly, in the specimen delineated at the
top of Pl. 354, the rays of the under-part of the body are spread upon a
brown ground; and not only the lower coverts of the tail are black, as in that
described by Brisson, but the lower belly is of the same colour.</P>
<P>The subject observed by Brisson came from Senegal. The
two which Edwards examined were brought from the East Indies; and most of
those which I have seen were brought from the Cape of Good Hope. Among so
many differences of the plumage remarked between these, some must depend
upon the distinction of sex.</P>
<P>The average length of these birds is about four inches and a
half; the bill is three or four lines; the alar extent six inches, and the
tail two inches, unequally tapered, and composed of twelve quills.</P>

<P>Brown is the predominant colour of the head, the back, the

red, and also the bill; the legs are red; sometimes the base of the bill

the coverts of the wings. Such was the Serevan sent from the Isle of France

<P>That called <HI>Serevan</HI> by Commerson had all the
under-part of the body of a light fulvous; its legs were yellowish; and
neither its bill nor its rump was red, and not a single speck could be
seen on it. Probably it was young, or was a female.</P>
<P>Other birds closely related to this, and sent by
Commerson, under the name of <HI>Cape Bengals,</HI> had a more distinct red

<P>China is not the only country from which this bird is brought;
that engraved by Edwards came from Malacca, and in all probability it might be

it exists in America, and whether so small a bird could traverse the
immense oceans which dis∣join the continents; at least it differs so
much from the Maias, the American birds which it the nearest approaches, as
to require a distinct name. In fact its properties are not the same; for
though it be rather larger, it has its wings and tail somewhat shorter, and
its bill as short; be∣sides, its plumage is different, and much inferior in
lustre.</P>
<P>In the Maian, all the upper-part of the body is a reddish

<P>THIS bird has great power in its bill, with which it nips so
bitterly as to draw blood. Hence, according to the several authors, the
French name of <HI>Pinson</HI> is derived (from <HI>pincer,</HI> to pinch).
But as the disposition to snap is not peculiar to the Chaffinch, but
common to other birds, to many different sorts of quadrupeds, millepedes,
&amp;c. I should rather adopt the opi∣nion of Frisch, who supposes this
word <HI>Pinson</HI> to come from <HI>Pincio,</HI> latinized for the German
<HI>Pinck,</HI> which seems imitative of the note of the bird.</P>
<P>The Chaffinches do not all migrate in the autumn; a
considerable number remains with us during the winter. These resort to
our dwel∣lings, and even visit our court-yards to obtain an easier
subsistence; they are little parasites, who seek to live at our
expence, without contri∣buting <PB REF="113"/> 
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE CHAFFINCH.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="97" REF="114"/> to our pleasures: for in that
season they never sing, except in fine days, which seldom then occur.
During the rest of the time they lodge concealed in close hedges, in oaks
that have not shed all their leaves, in evergreens, and even in holes of
rocks, where they are sometimes found dead when the weather is
excessively se∣vere. Those which migrate into other climates
assemble often in prodigious flocks; but whither do they retire? Frisch
supposes that their retreat lies in the northern regions: his reasons
are; 1. That on their return, they bring with them white Chaffinches, which are
hardly to be met with, except in those climates; 2. That they never lead
young ones in their train, which would be the case, if, during their
absence, they lived in a warm country, where they might be disposed to
breed; 3. That they can bear cold, except snow, which covering the fields,
deprives them in part of their subsistence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch.—Aldrovandus says, that in Italy, when there is
much snow and the frost very intense, the Chaffinches cannot fly, and are
caught by the hand; but this weakness may arise from inanition, and that
again from the abundance of snow. Olina alleges, that in the same country
the Chaffinches retire to the hilly tracts during the summer. Hebert has
seen many of them in that season among the highest mountains of Bugey,
where they were as common as in the plains, and where they certainly do not
remain through the winter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These arguments imply therefore, that there is a country in
the north where the earth is not robed in the winter; and such is said to
be the <PB N="98" REF="115"/> desarts of Tartary, where the snow falls
indeed, but is immediately swept away by the violence of the winds, and
extensive tracts laid bare.</P>
<P>A very remarkable circumstance in the migra∣tion of the
Chaffinches, is what Gesner men∣tions of those of Switzerland, and Linnaeus
of those of Sweden: that only the females remove to other climates, and the
males reside in the country during the winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"They quit Switzerland in the winter,
particularly the fe∣males; for several males are often seen, with not one
female." 
<BIBL>GESNER.</BIBL></Q> Linnaeus positively asserts,
that the female Chaffinches leave Sweden in flocks about the month of
September, that they direct their course to Holland, and return in the
spring to join their males which have wintered in Sweden.</P> 
<P>This singular remark is corroborated by Mr. White, who
found that the vast flocks of Chaffinches which appear in his neighbour∣hood
about Christmas, are almost entirely hens. Yet, as he seems not to have
dissected any, he might have been deceived by the change of plumage, which
is extremely probable.</P></NOTE>. But have not these able naturalists been
misled by the per∣sons who informed them, and those deceived by some
periodical change in the plumage of the females, occasioned by cold, or other
accidents? This explanation seems more suited to Nature's general plan, and
more conformable to analogy, than to suppose that, at a certain fixed term,
the females separate from mere caprice, and travel into a distant climate,
when their native soil can afford them subsistence.</P>
<P>The migrations vary in different countries. Aldrovandus
assures us, that the Chaffinches sel∣dom breed near Bologna, but almost
all depart <PB N="99" REF="116"/> about the end of winter, and return the
succeed∣ing autumn. On the other hand, I find from Willughby, that they
continue the whole year in England, and that few birds are so com∣mon.</P>
<P>They are spread through the whole of Europe, from the shores
of the Baltic and Sweden, where they are frequent, and nestle, to the Straits
of Gibraltar, and even the coasts of Africa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Being stationed on the coasts of Africa,
we were very often visited on board by Chaffinches. We cruised between the
thirtieth to the thirty-fifth degree of latitude:—I have even heard it
affirmed, that they are found at the Cape of Good Hope."

<P>The Chaffinch is a lively bird, and perpetually in motion; and
this circumstance, joined to the sprightliness of its song, has given
rise to the proverbial saying, <HI>gay as a Chaffinch.</HI> It be∣gins to
chant very early in the spring, and se∣veral days before the Nightingale,
and gives over about the summer solstice. Its song has merited an
analysis: and it is distinguished into the prelude, the quavering, and
the close<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The prelude is, according to
Frisch, composed of three si∣milar notes or strokes; the quaver, of
seven different notes de∣scending; and the close, of two notes. Lottinger
has also made some observations on this subject. 
<Q REND="inline">"In anger, the air of the Chaffinch is
simple and shrill; in fear, plaintive, short, and often repeated; in joy,
it is lively, and ends with a sort of burden."</Q></NOTE>; names have been
appropriated to the different parts; and the greatest connoisseurs in
these <PB N="100" REF="117"/> little matters agree, that the concluding part
is the most agreeable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In German, this is called
<HI>Reiterzu;</HI> in French, <HI>Boute-selle.</HI></NOTE>. Some find its
music too strong, or too grating<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mordant,</HI> biting.</NOTE>; but this must be im∣puted to
the excessive delicacy of our organs, or rather it is because the sound
is too near, and increased by the confused echo of our apart∣ments: Nature
has destined the Chaffinches to be songsters of the woods; let us repair
then to the grove, to taste and enjoy the beauties of their music.</P>
<P>If a young Chaffinch taken from the nest be educated under a
Canary, a Nightingale, &amp;c. it will have the song of its instructors:
more than one instance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This facility in
learning the songs of other birds accounts for the diversity observed in
the warble of the Chaffinches. In the Netherlands, five or six kinds of
Chaffinches are distinguished by the various length of their airs.</NOTE>
has been known of this; but they have never been brought to whistle our
tunes:—they never depart so wide from nature.</P>
<P>The Chaffinches, beside their ordinary warble, have a certain
tremulous expression oflove, which they can utter in the spring, and
also another cry which is unpleasant, and said to portend rain<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">In the German language a word is appropriated to denote
this: it is <HI>Schircken.</HI></NOTE>. It has been remarked too, that they
never sing better or longer than when, from some accident, they have lost
their sight<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">They are liable to this accident,
especially if kept between two windows which face the south.</NOTE>; and 
<PB N="101" REF="118"/> no sooner was this observation made, than the art
was discovered of rendering them blind. The lower eyelid is connected to the
upper by a sort of artificial cicatrix made by touching slightly and
repeatedly the edges with a wire heated red-hot in the fire, and taking care
not to hurt the ball of the eye. They must be pre∣pared for this singular
operation by confining them for ten or twelve days to the cage, and then
keeping them shut up with the cage in a chest night and day, to accustom
them to feed in the dark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner asserts, that if
the Chaffinches be kept thus shut up through the whole summer, and not let
out of their prison till the beginning of autumn, they sing during the
latter season, which would otherwise not happen. Darkness rendered them
dumb, but return of light is to them a second spring.</NOTE>. These blind
Chaffinches are in∣defatigable singers, and they are preferred as calls to
decoy wild Chaffinches into the snares: these are also caught with
bird-lime and with different kinds of nets, and among others those for larks,
but the meshes must be smaller in pro∣portion to the size of the
bird.</P>
<P>The time for the sport is, when the Chaf∣finches fly in
numerous flocks, either in autumn before their departure, or in spring on
their return. We must, as much as possible, choose calm weather, for
they keep lower and hear better the call. They do not easily bend to
cap∣tivity; they scarcely will eat any thing for the first two or three
days; they strike their bill <PB N="102" REF="119"/> continually against the
sticks of the cage, and often languish to death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those caught with lime-twigs often die the instant they are
taken.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These birds construct their nest very round and compact,
and place it in the closest trees or bushes; sometimes they build it
even in our gardens upon the fruit-trees, and conceal it so artfully that we
can hardly perceive it, though quite nigh. It is composed of white moss and
small roots on the outside, and lined with wool, hairs, spiders-webs, and
feathers. The female lays five or six eggs, which are reddish gray,
sprinkled with blackish spots, more frequent near the large end. The male
never deserts his mate in the time of hatching; he sits at night always at
hand; and if during the day he remove to a short distance, it is only to
procure food. Jealousy has perhaps some share in this excessive
assiduity; for these birds are of an amorous com∣plexion: when two males
meet in an orchard in the spring, they fight obstinately, till one of them
is vanquished and expelled: and the com∣bat is still more fierce if they be
lodged in the same volery with only a single female.</P>
<P>The parents feed their brood with caterpillars and insects:
they also eat these themselves, but their ordinary subsistence is
small seeds, those of the white thorn, of poppy, of burdock, of the
rose-tree, and especially beech-mast, rape and <PB N="103" REF="120"/>
hemp seed. They feed also upon wheat and even oats, and are expert in
shelling the grain to obtain the mealy substance. Though rather
obstinate, they can in time be instructed like Goldfinches to perform
several little feats; they learn to employ their wings and feet to draw up
the cup when they want to eat or drink.</P>
<P>The Chaffinch sits oftener squatted than perched; it never
walks hopping, but trips lightly along the ground, and is constantly busy
in picking up something: its flight is unequal; but when its nest is
attacked, it hovers above screaming.</P>
<P>This bird is somewhat smaller than our Spar∣row, and is too
well known to require a minute decription. The sides of the head, the
fore∣part of the neck, the breast, and the loins are of a wine colour: the
upper-part of the head and of the body chesnut; the rump olive, and a white
spot on the wing. In the female the bill is more slender, and the colours
less bright than in the male; but in both sexes the plumage is very
subject to vary. I have seen a hen Chassinch alive, caught on her eggs
the 7<SUP>th</SUP> of May, which differed from that described by Brisson: the
upper-part of its head and back was of a brown olive, a sort of gray collar
sur∣rounded the neck behind, the belly and the lower coverts of the tail were
white, &amp;c. And of the males, some have the upper-part of the head 
<PB N="104" REF="121"/> and neck cinereous, and others of a brown chesnut; in
some the quills of the tail near∣est the two middle ones are edged with
white, and in others they are entirely black. Does age occasion these
slight differences?</P>
<P>A young Chaffinch was taken from its mother, when its
tail-quills were six lines in length, and the under-part of its body was like
that of its mother; and the upper-part of a brown cine∣reous; the rump olive;
the wings were already marked with white rays: but the edges of the superior
mandible were not yet scalloped near the point as in the adult males. This
circum∣stance would lead me to suppose that the scal∣loping which
occurs in many species is not the primary organization, but is afterwards
pro∣duced by the continual pressure of the end of the lower mandible, which
is rather shorter, against the sides of the upper.</P>
<P>All the Chaffinches have the tail forked, com∣posed of twelve
quills; the ground colour of their plumage is dull cinereous, and the flesh
is not good to eat. The period of their life is seven or eight years.</P>
<P>Total length six and one-third inches; the bill six lines;
the alar extent near ten inches; the tail two and two-thirds, and extends about
sixteen lines beyond the wings.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of

<P>PERHAPS this bird, which in general is supposed to be the
Mountain Finch, or <HI>Orospiza</HI> of Aristotle, is in fact his
<HI>Spiza,</HI> or principal Finch; or our Common Finch or Chaffinch is his
Mountain Finch. The following are the reasons which incline me to this
opinion. The ancients never made complete descriptions, but seized a
prominent feature of an animal, whether in its exterior appearance or in its
habits, and marked it by an epithet. The <HI>Orospiza,</HI> says
Aristotle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is supposed to be Aristotle's
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Mountain Finch, whose
female was termed <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Golden
Mitred. In Ger∣man, <HI>Rowert, Schnec-Finck, Winter-Finck:</HI> in Swiss.
<HI>Wald-Finck, Thanu-Finck:</HI> in Swedish, <HI>Norrquint.</HI></NOTE>, is
like the <HI>Spiza;</HI> it is somewhat smaller; its neck is blue; and
lastly, it inhabits the mountains: but all these are properties of the
Chaffinch, and some of them belong to it exclusively.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is much like the Mountain Finch or Brambling, as
will appear from the comparison; and all systematic writers have
classed them to∣gether.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="109" REF="126"/> 2. The Chaffinch is rather
smaller than the Brambling, according to naturalists, and which agrees with
my own observations.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the Chaffinch, the upper-parts of the head and of
the neck are of a bluish cinereous; whereas in the Brambling these are
varied with glossy black and yellowish gray.</P>
<P N="4">4. We have already remarked, on the autho∣rity of Olina,
that in Italy the Chaffinch retires in summer to breed among the mountains;
and, as the climate of Greece is little different from that of Italy, we may
infer from analogy, it will there also have the same habits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch asserts that the Bramblings come from the mountains
in autumn, and when they return they direct their course to the north. The
Marquis de Piolenc, who has given me several notes on these birds,
assures me that they leave the mountains of Savoy and Dauphiny in October,
and do not return till February. These periods correspond well with the
time when they are seen to pass and repass in Burgundy.—Perhaps
both these species resemble each other in preferring
mountains.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lastly, the <HI>Spiza</HI> of Aristotle appears to
resort, according to that philosopher, to the warm regions during summer,
and to prefer the cold climates in winter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus positively asserts, that this takes place in the
neighbourhood of Bologna: Lottinger informs me, that some appear in Lorraine
from the end of August, but that large flocks arrive towards the end of
October, and even later.</NOTE>. But this agrees better with the Brambling than
with the Chaffinches, since of these a great proportion never migrate,
while the former not only are birds of passage, but <PB N="110" REF="127"/>
generally arrive in the depth of winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. viii. 3.</BIBL></NOTE> in the
different countries which they visit. This is evinced by experience, and is
confirmed by the appellations of Winter-Finch, and Snow-Finch, which they have
received in various places.</P>
<P>From all these considerations, it seems probable that the
Brambling is the <HI>Spiza</HI> of Aristotle, and the Chaffinch his
<HI>Orospiza.</HI></P>
<P>The Bramblings do not breed in our climates; they arrive in
different years in immense flocks. The time of their passage is the
autumn and winter: often they retire in eight or ten days, and sometimes they
remain till the spring. Dur∣ing their stay, they consort with the
Chaffinches, and, like these, seek concealment in the thick foliage. Vast
bodies of them appeared in Bur∣gundy in the winter of 1774, and other in
still more numerous flocks were seen in the country of Wirtemberg about the
end of December 1775, which every evening reposed in a valley adjoin∣ing to
the banks of the Rhine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Lottinger asserts perhaps too generally, that in the
day-time they spread through the forests of the plain, and in the evening
retire to the mountains. This conduct is not invariable, but seems to be
affected by situation and circumstances.</P> 
<P> A flock of more than three hundred were seen this year in
our neighbourhood; it halted three or four days in the same place, which is
mountainous. They always alighted on the same ches∣nut-tree, and when
sired at, rose all at once, and constantly directed their course to the
north and north-east. 
<BIBL><HI>Note of the Marquis</HI>
PIOLENC.</BIBL></P></NOTE>, and commenced <PB N="111" REF="128"/> their flight
with the earliest dawn: the ground was covered with their excrements. The
same occurrence was observed in the year 1735 and in 1757<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Gazette d' Agriculture,</HI> Ann. 1776.</BIBL></NOTE>.
Never perhaps were so many of these birds seen in Lorraine, as in the
winter of 1765: more than six hundred dozen, says Lottinger, were killed
every night in the pine-forests, which are four or five leagues from
Sarbourg. The people were not at the pains to shoot them, they knocked them
down with switches; and though this mas∣sacre lasted the whole winter,
the body was scarce perceptibly thinned. Willughby tells us, that many are
seen in the neighbourhood of Venice, no doubt in the time of passage; but
no where do they appear so regularly as in the forests of Weissemburg,
which are plentifully stocked with beeches, and consequently afford
abundance of mast, of which they are so fond, that they eat it day and
night; they live also on all sorts of small seeds. I suppose that
these birds remain in their native climate as long as they can procure the
proper food, and quit it only when scarcity obliges them to shift their
quarters; at least, it is certain that the plenty of their fa∣vourite seeds
is not sufficient to draw them to a country, and even to one with which they
are acquainted: for in 1774, when there was abundance of beech mast in
Lorraine, the Bramblings did not appear, but took a different 
<PB N="112" REF="129"/> route: however, in the following year, several flocks
were seen, though there was a scarcity of mast<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I
owe those facts to Mr. Lottinger.</NOTE>. When they arrive among us, they are
not shy, but allow a person to go very near them. They fly close
together, and alight and rise in the same compact body; and for this
reason twelve or fifteen of them may be killed at one shot.</P>
<P>When they feed in the sields, they are ob∣served to perform
the same manoeuvres as the pigeons; a few always precede, and are follow∣ed
by the rest of the flock.</P>
<P>These birds, we see, are known and spread through all
parts of Europe; but they are not confined to our quarter of the globe. Edwards
observed some that were brought from Hud∣son's-bay, under the name of
<HI>Snow-birds;</HI> and people who traded to that country assured him that
they were the first which appeared every year on the return of spring,
before even the snows were melted.</P>
<P>The flesh of the Bramblings, though some∣what bitter, is
good to eat, and undoubtedly better than that of the Chaffinch. Their plu∣mage
is also more varied, more beautiful, and more glossy; but their song is
far from being so pleasant, and it has been compared to the screech of
the owl<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Belon.</BIBL></NOTE> and the
mewing of the cat<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Olina.</BIBL></NOTE>.
They have two cries; the one a sort <PB N="113" REF="130"/> of chirping, and
the other which they utter when they sit on the ground resembles that of
the Stone-chat, but is neither so strong nor so clear. Though by nature
endowed with so few talents, these birds are susceptible of
in∣struction; and when kept near another whose warble is more pleasant,
their song gradually mellows, and comes to resemble that which they
hear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Olina.</BIBL></NOTE>. But to have a just
idea of their music, we must listen to them in the time of hatching; it
is then, when chanting the hymn of love, that birds display their true
warble.</P>
<P>A fowler, who had travelled, assured me that these birds
are bred in Luxemburg; that they make their nests in the most branchy firs
at a considerable height; that they begin about the end of April; that they
employ the long moss of firs for the outside, and hair, wool, and fea∣thers
for the lining; that the female lays four or five yellowish spotted eggs;
and that they begin to flutter from branch to branch about the end of May.</P>
<P>The Brambling is, according to Belon, a cou∣rageous bird, and
defends itself with its bill to the last gasp. All agree that it is of a
more easy temper than the Chaffinch, and more readily ensnared. Many of
them are killed in certain fowling-matches which are frequent in the coun∣try
of Weissemburg, and which deserve to be re∣lated. <PB N="114" REF="131"/>
The fowlers assemble at the little town of Bergzabern; on the evening of
the day ap∣pointed, they dispatch scouts to remark the trees on which the
Bramblings commonly pass the night, and which are generally the pitch-pines,
and other ever-greens; the scouts, after their return, serve as guides for
the company, which set out in the evening with torches and
shooting∣trunks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sarbacanes.</HI></NOTE>. The
birds are dazzled with the glare, and killed by pellets of dry earth
discharged from the trunks. They shoot very near, lest they should
miss; for if a bird chanced to be wounded, its cries would scare away the
flock.</P>
<P>The principal food of these birds, when kept in a cage, is
panic, hemp-seed, and beech∣mast. Olina says that they live four or five
years.</P>
<P>Their plumage varies: in some males the throat is black; in
others, the head is entirely white, and the colours in general lighter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aldrovandus.</BIBL></NOTE>. Frisch remarks,
that the young males are not so black at their arrival, and that the inferior
co∣verts of their wings are not so vivid a yellow as at their departure.
Perhaps a more advanced age occasions still other differences between the
sexes, and may account for the diversity of descriptions.</P>
<P>The Brambling which I observed weighed an ounce; its face was
black; the upper-part of its <PB N="115" REF="132"/> head, neck, and back,
varied with yellowish∣gray, and glossy-black; the throat, the fore-part
of the neck, the breast, and the rump, rust-co∣loured; the small coverts
of the base of the wing, yellow-orange; the others formed two transverse
rays of a yellowish-white, separated by a broader black bar; all the quills
of the wing, except the three first, had on their outer edge, where the great
coverts terminate, a white spot, about five lines long; the succession
of these spots formed a third white ray, which was parallel to the two
others when the wing was expanded, but when the wing was closed it ap∣peared
only like an oblong spot almost parallel to the side of the quills;
lastly, these quills were of an exceedingly fine black, edged with white.
The small inferior coverts of the wings next the body were distinguished
by their beautiful yel∣low colour. The quills of the tail were black, edged
with white, or whitish; the tail forked; the flanks streaked with black;
the legs of a brown-olive; the nails slightly incurvated, the hind one the
strongest of all; the edges of the upper mandible scalloped near the
point, the edges of the lower one fitted into the upper; and the tongue parted
at the tip into several delicate filaments.</P>
<P>The intestinal tube was fourteen inches long; the gizzard was
muscular, coated with a carti∣laginous membrane slightly adhering, and
pre∣ceded by a dilatation of the <HI>oesophagus,</HI> and also 
<PB N="116" REF="133"/> by a craw of five or six lines diameter: the whole was
filled with small seeds without a single pebble. I did not see a
<HI>coecum,</HI> or gall∣bladder.</P>
<P>The female has not the orange spot at the base of the bill,
nor the fine yellow colour of the lower coverts; the throat is of a lighter
ru∣fous; and it has a cinereous cast on the crown of the head, and behind the
neck.</P>
<P>Total length six inches and one-fourth; bill six lines and a
half; alar extent ten inches; tail two inches and one-third, and reaches about
fif∣teen lines beyond the wings.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">

<P>This bird is the largest of the European Finches. Klein
says that it is equal in bulk to the lark. It is found in Lapland, near
Torneo. Its head is blackish, varied with a rusty-white colour, and marked
on each side with a white ray, which rises from the eye, and descends
along the neck; the neck, throat, and breast, are of a light-rufous colour;
the belly, and the hind part, white; the upper-part of the body rusty,
variegated with brown; the wings black, edged with pale-yellow and greenish,
and crossed with a white ray; the tail forked, composed of twelve quills
that are almost black, and edged with yellowish; the bill horn-coloured,
and deeper near the point; the legs black.</P>
<P>Total length six inches and a half; bill seven lines, and
the legs and mid-toe the same; alar extent eleven inches and a half; tail two

soon retires. It is found also in Lapland, and in the northern parts of
Siberia. It appears in November at Hudson's-bay, where it passes the
win∣ter among the juniper bushes. It sings nearly like the Linnet, but has
a loftier and better supported flight. It trips on the ground like a Lark,
picking up seeds.</NOTE></P>

</LIST></HEAD>
<P>ALL the species of Widows are inhabitants of Africa; but they
are not entirely con∣fined to that region, for they occur in Asia, and even
in the Philippine Islands. They all have a conical bill of sufficient
strength to break the seeds on which they feed: they all are
distin∣guished by a long tail, or rather by long feathers, which in most
of the males accompany the true tail, and are inserted above or below its
origin: lastly, all, or nearly all of them, are subject to two annual
moultings, the interval between which corresponds to the rainy season,
and lasts six or eight months, during which the males lose not only their
long tail, but their rich colour and pleasant warble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The melody of their song is one of the reasons that induces
Edwards to class them with the Finches rather than with the Sparrows.</NOTE>;
and it is not before the return of spring that they recover the attributes or
ornaments of their sex.</P>
<P>The females undergo the same moultings, but not only is the
change less perceptible in them, but the colours of their plumage are not
so much affected.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="150"/> The period of the first moulting in the
young males must evidently depend on the time of their birth: those of the
earliest hatch assume their long tail in May; but those hatched
latest in the season, do not assume it till September or October.</P>
<P>Travellers assert that the Widows construct their nest
with cotton, and that they divide it into two stories<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Kolben's description of the Cape of Good Hope. It
appears very probable, that the changeable-plumaged Gold∣sinches, of which he
speaks, are really Widow-birds.</NOTE>, the upper being destined for the
male, and the under for the female. It is possible to ascertain this
circumstance in Europe, and even in France, where by a careful atten∣tion the
Widows may be made to lay and hatch, as is successfully practised in
Holland.</P>
<P>These birds are lively and volatile, and are constantly
raising and dropping the tail: they are very fond of bathing, not at all
subject to diseases, and live twelve or fifteen years. They are fed with
a mixture of spikenard and millet; and by way of cooling, they have leaves of
succory.</P>
<P>It is somewhat odd that the name of Widows, by which they are
now generally known, and which seems to be very applicable to both, because
of the black that predominates in their plu∣mage, and because of their train
at the tail, owed its origin to a mere mistake. The Portu∣guese 
<PB N="134" REF="151"/> called them at first <HI>Birds of Whidha</HI> (that
is, of Juida), because they are very common on that coast of Africa; and
foreigners were de∣ceived by the similarity between that word and the name of
Widow in the Portuguese tongue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards was led into
this mistake, which he afterwards discovered.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We shall here treat of eight species of Widows; viz. the
five already known and described by Brisson; two new ones which are
already dis∣tinguished by a beautiful red spot on the wing, and another
on the breast: lastly, to these I shall add the Bird which Brisson
calls <HI>the Long∣tailed Linnet,</HI> which, were it only for the long tail, I
should rather range with the Widows than with the Linnets.</P>

coverts of the under-part of the tail blackish; the head, throat, fore-part
of the neck, <PB N="135" REF="152"/> back, wings, and tail, black. The tail is
formed as in other birds; it consists of twelve quills nearly equal, and
covered by four long feathers, which rise also from the rump, but
somewhat higher; the two longest are about thirteen inches, and are black,
like those of the tail, and appear waved, and as it were clouded; a little
arched like those of the cock; their breadth, which is nine lines near the
rump, is reduced to three near the extremity: the shortest are inclosed
between the two longest, and are only half as long, but they are twice as
broad, and end in a slender silky filament, more than an inch long.</P>
<P>These four feathers have their planes in a ver∣tical
situation, and are bent downwards; they drop every year in the first
moulting about the beginning of November, and at this period their plumage
suffers a total change, and becomes like that of the Brambling. It is now
variegated on the head with white and black; the breast, the back, the
superior coverts of the wings, dirty orange, sprinkled with blackish; the
fea∣thers of the tail and the wings of a very deep brown; the belly, and all
the rest of the under-part of the body, white:—Such is its winter garb,
which it retains till the vernal season, when it undergoes a second
moulting as complete as the former, but happier in its effects, for it
restores the fine colours, the long feathers, and all the decorations; and
before the <PB N="136" REF="153"/> beginning of July the bird has experienced a
total renovation. The colour of its eyes, of its bill, and of its legs, never
vary: the eyes are chesnut; the bill lead-colour; and the legs
flesh∣colour.</P>
<P>The young females are nearly of the colour of the males in
moult; but at the end of three years, their plumage has become brown, almost
black, and changes no more.</P>
<P>These birds are common in the kingdom of Angola, on the
western coast of Africa: some have also been sent from Mozambique, a
small island on the eastern coast of the same continent, and which
differed little from the former. The subject which Edwards figured lived four
years in London.</P>

<P>If length of tail be the distinguishing charac∣ter of the
Widow birds, this is the least entitled to that appellation; for the
longest quills of its tail scarcely exceed four inches. It has received the
name of <HI>Dominican,</HI> on account of its black and white plumage; all the
upper-part of the body is variegated with these two colours; the rump, and
the superior coverts of the tail, are mottled with dirty white and
blackish; the up∣per-part of the head of a white-reddish, en∣circled with
black; the throat, the fore-part of the neck, and the breast, of the same
white, which also extends behind, and forms a half∣collar 
<PB N="139" REF="157"/> on the posterior surface of the neck. The belly has
none of the rufous tinge. The bill is red, and the legs gray.</P>
<P>This species undergoes two moultings annu∣ally, like the
preceding; in the interval the male is divested of its long tail, and its
white is dirtier. The female never has these long fea∣thers of the tail, and
its plumage is constantly of an almost uniform brown.</P>
<P>Length to the end of the tail, six inches and one fourth; to
the end of the nails, four inches; the bill four lines and a half; the legs
seven lines; the mid-toe seven lines and a half; the alar extent seven
inches and a half; the middle feathers of the tail project about two inches and
one fourth beyond the lateral ones, which are notched, and three inches and one
fourth be∣yond the wings.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character:—

it was called <HI>Brenoud,</HI> is nothing but this same Widow in moult; and
he thence concluded, that when the male moulted its plumage it was more
uniform. But this would apply better to the female than to the male; and yet
there is a wide difference between bluish-black, which is the colour of the
Brenoud, and uniform brown, which is that of the female Domini∣can. This

<HI>(Bruant);</HI> though in many provinces it bears the same name; for, not

palate.</P>
<P>The Greenfinch passes the winter in the woods, and
shelters itself from the inclemency of the season in the ever-green
trees, and even in elms and branchy oaks which retain their withered
leaves.</P>
<P>In spring it makes it nest in the same trees, and
sometimes in bushes: this nest is larger, and almost as neatly formed
as that of the Chaffinch; it consists of dry herbs and moss, lined with
hair, wool, and feathers: sometimes it places it in the chinks of the
branches, which <PB N="148" REF="169"/> it even widens with its bill; it also
constructs near the spot a little magazine for provisions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We owe these last facts, and some others, to M.

<P>The female lays five or six eggs, spotted at the large end
with brown red on a white green∣ish ground. She sits assiduously, and
still con∣tinues on her eggs though a person approaches pretty near; so
that she is often caught with her young: at all other times she is shy
and timid. The male seems to take much interest in the concerns of his
future family; he relieves his mate in hatching; wheels round the tree where
his hopes are lodged, makes sudden springs, and again sinks back,
flapping his wings, and war∣bling joyous notes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They are kept in a cage, because they sing pleasantly.
BELON. Guys adds, that the warble of the female is even superior to that of
the male, which would be singular in birds.</NOTE>. At his return to the
coun∣try, and at his departure, he utters a singular cry, consisting of
two sounds. The warble is said to be improved in the cross breed between
the Greenfinch and the Canary.</P>
<P>The Greenfinches are gentle, and easily tam∣ed; they learn to
articulate a few words; and no bird so soon becomes expert at the little
manoeuvre of drawing up the cup<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>De la
galere,</HI> alluding to the labour of a galley-slave.</NOTE>. They eat from
the singer of their master, and answer his call, &amp;c. In autumn they
join other species, to roam in the fields; they live upon juniper ber∣ries in
winter; they crop the buds of trees, and <PB N="149" REF="170"/> particularly
those of the bog-willow; they feed in summer on all sorts of seeds, and
especially those of hemp; they also eat caterpillars, ants, and
grasshoppers.</P>
<P>The name alone denotes that the predomi∣nant colour of the
plumage is green; but the tinge is not pure; there is a gray-brown cast on
the upper-part of the body and on the flanks, with an admixture of yellow on
the throat and breast; yellow is spread over the top of the belly, the
inferior coverts of the tail and wings, and on the rump; it edges the largest
quills of the wings, and also the lateral quills of the tail: all these are
blackish, and most of them bordered with white on the inside; the lower
belly is also white, and the legs reddish-brown.</P>
<P>The female has more brown; her belly is entirely white, and the
inferior coverts of her tail are mingled with white, brown, and yellow.</P>
<P>The bill is flesh-coloured, shaped like a cone, and
similar to that of the Grosbeak, but smaller; its upper edges are
slightly scalloped near the point, and receive those of the lower
mandible, which are somewhat <HI>re-entrant.</HI> The bird weighs rather more
than an ounce, and is nearly of the bulk of the House-sparrow.</P>
<P>Total length five inches and a half; the bill six lines and a
half; the alar extent nine inches; the tail twenty-three lines, somewhat
forked, stretching beyond the wings ten or eleven lines. These birds have a

yellowish green; the great quills of the wings are brown, edged delicately

length-wise into brown and green.</P>
<P>These birds breed in Carolina on the orange trees, but do
not continue there during the <PB N="152" REF="174"/> winter. Like the Widows,
they have two moultings annually, which are earlier or later according to
circumstances. Sometimes they assume their winter garb in the end of
August or the beginning of September; in this state the under-part of their
body changes from red to yellowish. They feed like the Widow-birds, upon
millet, Canary-seeds, succory, &amp;c. . . . but they are more delicate:
however, if they are once seasoned to the climate, they will live eight or
ten years. They are found in Louisiana.</P>

marked with a train of white points, which are apparent on the dark ground:
these are the white specks which termi∣nate all the quills of the wing,
except the two or three first. The quills of the tail are of a still deeper
black; the six intermediate ones tipt with white, and the two last have on
each side on their inner webs an oval white spot, which is conspicuous.
But these white-points vary in their number and arrangement; and in general
the plumage of the Goldfinch is far from being constant<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sometimes six intermediate quills of the tail are tipt with
white, sometimes eight of these, and sometimes only four, or even two:
and the Goldfinches have received appellations accord∣ingly. Nay, the
difference observed in their song has been at∣tributed to the number of the
small spots. Those which have six feathers tipt with white are said
to warble the sweetest; but this assertion is without foundation, for
the number is often di∣minished by moulting, though the song remains
invariably the same. Kramer says, that the quills of the tail and of the
wings are tipt with white in autumn, and are entirely black in spring: this
needs to be qualified. I have beside me at present (6th April), two cock
Goldfinches, in which all the wing-quills except the two first and the six
intermediate ones of the tail, are tipt with white: and in which are also the
oval spots on the inner-side of the two lateral quills of the
tail.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The female has less red than the male, and no black at all.
The young ones do not assume their fine red till the second year: they
are at first stained with dirty obscure colours, and, for that reason,
they are called <HI>Grisets;</HI> but the yellow on the wings appears early,
and also the <PB N="162" REF="185"/> white spots on the quills of the tail;
yet these spots are of a duller white<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observed
before the 15th June. I have also remarked, that when the Goldfinches were
quite young, their bill was brown, ex∣cept the point and edges, which were
whitish and transparent; which is the reverse of their appearance when
adult.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The males have a well-known and a pleasant warble. They begin
about the 1st of March, and continue during the whole of the genial
season: they chant even in the winter when kept in warm apartments, where
they enjoy the temperature of spring<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have
two which sang every day through the whole of this winter, kept in a close
chamber, but without any fire. The greatest cold has not indeed been under
eight degrees (fifty de∣grees Fahrenhest).</NOTE>. Aldrovandus ranks them the
fecond of the singing birds: Daines Barrington admits them only into the
sixth place. They seem to have a greater facility in acquir∣ing the song
of the Wren than that of any other bird<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Philos, Trans.</HI> 1773.</BIBL> Olina says, that
the young Goldfinches which hear Linnets, Canaries, &amp;c. acquire their
song. But I know of a young cock Goldfinch and a young hen Linnet that were
bred together; and the Goldfinch retained his native warble, while the Linnet
adopted and improved it.</NOTE>. This has been experienced both by Salerne and
Barrington. The latter indeed supposes, that this imitation was
occasioned by the early impressions made by the notes of that little
bird; but we must either account in the same way for the case noticed by
Salerne, or admit that there is a certain analogy between the organs of sound
in the Goldfinch and the Wren.</P>
<P>In England, the Goldfinches from Kent are reckoned the best
singers.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="186"/> These birds and the Chaffinches
construct the neatest and most compact nests. They consist of fine
moss, lichens, liver-wort, rushes, small roots, and the down of
thistles, interwoven with great art, and lined with dry grass, hair, wool,
and down: they generally place them in trees, and particularly on plums and
walnuts, and eommonly select the weak branches which shake the most.
Sometimes they nestle in copses, and sometimes in thorny bushes; and it
is said that the young Goldfinches bred in such situations are of a
darker plumage, but more sprightly, and sing better than others. Olina
makes the same remark in regard to those hatched in the month of August.
The female begins to lay about the middle of spring, at first, five eggs,
spotted with reddish brown near the large end<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon
says, that the Goldfinches have commonly eight young; but I have never found
more than five eggs in about thirty nests which I have seen.</NOTE>. If the
nest be demolished, she makes a se∣cond or even a third hatch, but the
number of eggs diminishes each time. I have never found more than four eggs
in the nests brought to me in July, nor more than two in those of
September.</P>
<P>These birds are much attached to their young; they feed them
with caterpillars and insects: if both be caught together and shut up in
the same cage, the parents will still continue their care. It is true, that
of four young Goldfinches which <PB N="164" REF="187"/> I treated this way, none
lived more than a month; but I attribute this to the improper choice of food,
and not to the heroic despair which, it is pretended, prompts them to kill
their offspring, and thus deliver them from slavery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gerini, and many others. It is even added, that if the young ones
be reared in a cage by parents which are suffered to enjoy freedom, these
observing after some time the impossibility to rescuing their brood
from bondage, will out of compassion poison them with a certain herb.
Such fables need no refutation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The cock Goldfinch ought to have only one female, and, that
their union may be productive, both should be at liberty. It is somewhat
singular, that the cock Goldfinch, when shut in a volery, is not so much
disposed to pair with his own female as with the hen Canary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is said that the Goldfinches intermix with none
of a different species; and that the experiment has been made without
success in regard to the Linnets. But I confidently affirm, that with
proper care we may obtain not only this, but many other combinations: for the
Siskins are still more easily reconciled to the society of the Canaries
than the Goldfinches, and yet it is said that, in case of rivalship, the
Goldfinches are preferred by the hen Canaries.</NOTE>, or any other female of a
warm temperament.</P>
<P>Sometimes the hen Goldfinch breeds with the cock Canary, but
this is unfrequent<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Father Bougot let a cock and
hen Goldfinch into a volery where there was a great number of Canaries of both
sexes. The male Canaries copulated with the hen Goldfinch, while the cock
Goldfinch had no partner: which proves the ardour of the Canaries.</NOTE>; and
on the other hand, the hen Canary, if separated from the males, will
consort with the cock Gold∣finch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circumstance
is essential; for Father Bougot assures me, that if the female Canaries
have a fourth or even a sixth of their num∣ber of males, they will not
associate with the cock Goldfinch; and that it is only when neglected by
their own species that they join the stranger, in which case they always
make the first advances.</NOTE>. <PB N="165" REF="188"/> The female is the
first to feel the ar∣dour of passion, and endeavours, by all alluring
arts, and assisted by the still more powerful in∣fluence of the genial
season, to urge her languid paramour to consummate this physical
adultery: and yet there must be no female of his own species in the volery.
The preliminaries last commonly six weeks, during which time the hen Canary
makes a complete laying of addle eggs, for which her incessant
solicitations have not procured fecundation; what in animals may be termed
lust, is almost always subordinate to the great end of nature, the
reproduction of the species. Father Bougot, whom I have al∣ready quoted with
approbation, has observed with attention the little manoeuvres of the
va∣riegated female Canary in such situations: she often approached the
male Goldfinch, and squatted like a common hen, but with more
ex∣pression, to invite him to the fruition: at first he is deaf to her
solicitations, but the flame steals upon him by degrees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have heard it alleged that the Goldfinch was a cold bird; he may
be so in comparison of the Canaries, but after he is roused, he appears
much animated; the male has frequently been observed to drop in an epileptit
fit, while he chanted rapturously in the height of his passion.</NOTE>:
often he be∣gins the embrace, and his resolution as often 
<PB N="166" REF="189"/> fails; at each attempt he spreads his wings and gives
vent to feeble cries. However, after the union is accomplished, he proceeds
to discharge the duties of a parent; he assists his mate in
constructing the nest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They prefer moss and dry
grass for the materials.</NOTE>, and carries food to her while she is
engaged in hatching, or in rearing her young.</P>
<P>Though these constrained amours will some∣times succeed
with a hen Canary and a wild Goldfinch, it is better to raise together
those in∣tended for breeding, and not to pair them till they are two years
old. The offspring resem∣bles more the father in the shape of the bill, in
the colours of the head and of the wings, and in short in all the
extremities, and the mother in the rest of the body: they have also been
remarked to be stronger, and live longer; and to have a clearer natural
warble, but to be not so docile in adopting the notes of our artificial
music.</P>
<P>These hybrids are still capable of propagating, and when
they are paired with the hen Canary, the second generation has a manifest
analogy to the species of the Goldfinch<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hebert.</BIBL></NOTE>; so much does the male influence
predominate in the act of generation.</P>
<P>The Goldfinch flies low, but with an even continued motion, like
the Linnet; and not by jerks and bounds, like the Sparrow. It is an 
<PB N="167" REF="190"/> active and laborious bird; if not employed in pecking
the heads of poppies, of hemp, or of thistles, it is constantly busy in
carrying back∣wards and forwards whatever it can find in its cage. One
solitary male of this species is suf∣ficient to disturb a whole volery
of Canaries; it teazes the females while they are sitting, fights with their
males, tears away the nests, and breaks the eggs. We should hardly conceive
that birds so lively and petulant could be so gentle and even so docile.
They live in harmony with each other, seek each other's society, give marks
of regard at all seasons, and seldom quarrel but about their food. They
are not so peaceful with other birds; they beat the Canaries and Linnets,
but, in their turn, they receive the same treatment from the Titmouse. They
have a singular instinct of always chusing to sleep in the highest
part of the volery; and we may naturally suppose a ground of quarrel will
be afforded, when the other birds will not give place to them.</P>
<P>The docility of the Goldfinches is well known: they can be
instructed without much trouble to perform several movements with accuracy,
to fire a cracker, and to draw up small cups con∣taining their food and
drink; but for this last purpose they must be <HI>clothed.</HI> This
clothing consists of a small belt of soft leather two lines broad, with
four holes through which the feet and wings are passed, and the ends
joining un∣der <PB N="168" REF="191"/> the belly, are held by a ring which
supports the chain of the cup. In solitude it delights to view its image in
the mirror, fancying it sees another of its own species; and this
attachment to society seems to equal the cravings of nature; for often it
is observed to pick up the hemp seed, grain by grain, and advance to eat at
the mirror, imagining, no doubt, that it feeds in company.</P>
<P>To succeed in breeding Goldfinches, they ought to be
separated and raised singly, or at least each with the female with
which it is in∣tended to be paired.</P>
<P>The younger Madame Daubenton educated a whole hatch; the young
Goldfinches became tame at a certain age, and afterwards relapsed into the
same savage state in which they would be found if bred by their parents
in the field: they renounce the refinements of man to enjoy the society of
their fellows.—But this is not the only inconvenience of training them
together; they acquire an affection for each other, and when separated, to
pair with a female Canary, they are languid in their amours, are affected by
the tender remembrance of former friendships, and commonly die of
melancholy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of five Goldfinches bred in the volery of
this lady, and paired with hen Canaries, three remained inactive: the other two
copu∣lated, but broke the eggs, and died soon afterwards.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="192"/> The Goldfinches begin to assemble in
au∣tumn, and during that season they are caught among the birds of
passage which pillage our gardens. Their natural vivacity precipitates them
into the snares; but, to succeed well, it is necessary to have a male
that has been ac∣customed to sing. They are not caught by calls; and they
elude the bird of prey by taking shel∣ter among the bushes. In winter they
fly in numerous flocks, so that seven or eight may be killed at a shot;
they approach the highways near which are thistles and wild succory; they
shake off the snow to obtain the seeds and the caterpillars. In Provence
they lodge in great numbers among the almond-trees; when the cold is intense
they seek the cover of thick bushes, and always near their proper food.
Those kept in the cage are commonly fed with hemp-seed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though it is true in general that the granivorous birds live upon
seeds, they also eat caterpillars, small grubs and insects, and even
feed their young with the last; they also devour with great avidity small
rags of boiled veal; but such as are reared prefer in the end hemp and
rape-seed to every other aliment.</NOTE>. They live to a great age; Ges∣ner
saw one at Mayence which was twenty-three years old; they were obliged once
a-week to scrape its nails and bill, that it might drink, eat, and sit upon
its bar; its common food was poppy-seeds; its feathers were all turned white;
it could not fly, but remained in whatever situa∣tion it was placed. In the
country where I re∣side it sometimes lives sixteen or eighteen years.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="193"/> They are subject to epilepsy, as I
have already observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Owing, it is said, to a long
slender worm which creeps under the flesh in the thigh, and sometimes
pierces through the skin, but which the bird eradicates with its bill. I
doubt not the existence of these worms, which Frisch mentions; but I
suspect that they are not the cause of the epilepsy.</NOTE>, and to

on the belly of one of these birds, red on the head, rufous on the back,
yellow on the quills of the wings, and white at their tips and on the bill. It

Ca∣naries, Goldfinches, Greenfinches, Siskins, Yel∣low Buntings, and Linnets;
and they are ca∣pable of propagation: nay, the breed seems to be improved by
crossing, for they are larger, stronger, and have clearer voices, &amp;c.
One effect of this intermixture is a multiplication of <PB N="177" REF="200"/>

<P>The Hybrid of Albin was obtained from a cock Goldfinch,

the under-part of the body, and the quills of the tail, yellow, the last tipt

<P>All those who have mentioned this bird give it the
appellation of American Goldfinch; yet this term would not be proper till it
was ascer∣tained that no other Goldfinch existed in the 
<PB N="180" REF="203"/> New World, and this supposition is not only
improbable, but absolutely false, for that of the preceding article is a
native of Brazil; I have therefore adopted another denomination, which
characterizes its plumage. The bill is nearly of the same shape and colour
as the Common Goldfinch; the forehead black, which is pecu∣liar to the male;
the rest of the head, the neck, the back, and the breast, shining yellow;
the thighs, the lower belly, the superior and in∣ferior coverts of the tail,
yellowish-white; the small coverts of the wings yellow on the outside,
whitish on the inside, and tipt with white; the great coverts black, and
terminated with white slightly shaded with brown, which form two
transverse rays that are very apparent on the black wings; the middle
quills of these are tipt with white; those contiguous to the back and their
coverts are edged with yellow; the quills of the tail amount to twelve, are of
equal lengths, black above, and equal below; the lateral ones white on the
inside near the tip; the bill and legs flesh-coloured.</P>
<P>In the female the forehead is not black, but of an
olive-green, and all the upper-part of the body is of the same colour; the
yellow of the rump, and of the under-part of the body, is less brilliant; the
black on the wings more dilute, and on the contrary the transverse rays are
not so faint; lastly, the belly, and the inferior co∣verts of the tail, are
entirely white.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="204"/> The young male is distinguished
from the fe∣male by nothing but its black forehead.</P>
<P>The female observed by Edwards was shut up alone in a
cage, and yet layed in the month of August 1755, a small egg of pearl-gray,
and without spots; but, what is more uncommon, Edwards adds, that it moulted
regularly twice a-year, in March and September. In winter the body was entirely
brown; but the head, wings, and tail, retained that colour only in summer.
The male died too soon for this observation; but probably, like the female,
it would have dropt its feathers twice annually, and in that respect
resemble the Bengals, the Widow-birds, and many other natives of warm
climates.</P>
<P>In the subject observed by Brisson, the belly, the
loins, the inferior coverts of the tail, and of the wings, were of the same
yellow with the rest of the body; the superior coverts of the tail
white∣gray; the bill, the legs, and the nails, white: but most of these
differences may be owing to the different states in which the bird has been
examined. Edwards drew it from the life, and his specimen appears besides
to have been larger than that of Brisson.</P>
<P>Catesby tells us that it is very rare in Caro∣lina, more

<P>BRISSON calls this bird the Little Vine Linnet: but it appears
to resemble the Siskin, and its song is much inferior to that of the
Linnet. Gesner tells us, that at Nuremberg it has the name of
<HI>Tschiit-Scherle,</HI> on account of its sharp cry; he adds, that it
appears only once in five or seven years<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Whatever is uncommon turns into the marvellous. Some say that
the appearance of numerous flocks of the Lesser Redpolls forebodes a
plague; others, that they are rats metamorphosed into birds before the
winter, and resume their proper form in the spring. In this way it is
accounted for their not being found in summer.

<BIBL>NAVARETTE.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Frisch in∣forms 
<PB N="184" REF="207"/> us, that in Germany it arrives in October and November,
and departs in February.</P>
<P>I have said that it bears more analogy to the Siskin than to
the Linnet; this was the opinion of Gesner, and it is also that of Dr.
Lottinger, who is well acquainted with these little birds. Frisch goes
farther, for he asserts that the Siskin will serve for a call to allure
the Lesser Redpolls into snares in the time of passage, and that the
two species intermix and propagate with each other. Aldrovandus perceived a
strong likeness between the Lesser Redpoll and the Goldfinch, which,
except its red head, resembles much a Siskin. A bird-catcher of great
experience and little reading, told me that he has caught many of the
Lesser Redpolls intermixed with Siskins, which they were very like,
especially the females, only their plumage was darker, and their bill
shorter. Lastly, Linnaeus says, that the Lesser Redpolls fre∣quent
places covered with alders, and Schwenck∣feld reckons the seeds of these
trees among the aliments which they prefer; but the Siskins are extremely
fond of these seeds. The Lesser <PB N="185" REF="208"/> Redpolls eat not
rape seed like the Linnet, but hemp seed, the seed of speckled nettles,
of thistles, of flax, of poppies, and crop the buds of young branches of oak,
&amp;c.: they mix readily with other birds: they are particularly tame in
winter, and will then allow us to approach very near them without being
scared<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These remarks are Lottinger's. Schwenckfeld
relates, that a prodigious number of the Lesser Redpolls were caught in the
be∣ginning of winter A. D. 1602.</NOTE>. In general, they have little timidity,
and can easily be caught with lime-twigs.</P>
<P>The Lesser Redpoll frequents the woods, and often lodges in
the oaks: it creeps along the trunk like the Titmouse, and also clings to
the extremity of the small branches. Hence pro∣bably is derived the name of
<HI>Linaria Truncalis</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">i. e. Trunk
Linnet.</NOTE>, and perhaps that of Little Oak.</P>
<P>The Lesser Redpolls grow very fat, and are excellent eating.
Schwenckfeld says, that they have a craw like the poultry, distinct from
the small sac formed by the dilatation of the <HI>oesopha∣gus</HI> before
its insertion into the gizzard: this gizzard is muscular, as is that of all
the granivo∣rous tribe, and many pebbles are found in it.</P>
<P>In the male, the breast and the top of the head are red, and
there are two white transverse stripes on the wings; the rest of the
head and all the upper-part of the body, mixed with brown and light rufous; the
throat brown; the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail and 
<PB N="186" REF="209"/> wings, rusty white; their quills brown, with a
complete border of a more delicate colour; the bill yellowish, but brown near
the tip; the legs brown. Those observed by Schwenckfeld had cinereous
backs.</P>
<P>In the female, there is no red except on the head, and it is
besides less bright. Lin∣naeus excludes it entirely; but perhaps the one
which he examined had been kept long in the cage.</P>
<P>Klein relates, that having electrified in the spring one of
these birds, and a Goldfinch, without occasioning to them any sensible
in∣jury, they both died the following October the same night: but what
deserves to be noticed is, that both had entirely lost their red tinge.</P>
<P>Total length above five inches; the alar ex∣tent eight inches

<P>OF all the granivorous birds, the Goldfinch is reckoned the
most a-kin to the Siskin; both have the bill elongated and slender near
the point; both are gentle, docile, and lively. The fruits of their
intermixture are also fit to propa∣gate.—Some naturalists have been
induced by these analogies, to regard them as two contigu∣ous species
belonging to the same genus: indeed all the granivorous birds may be
classed together; for their cross-breed are prolific. Since this general
character extends to them all, it becomes the more necessary to select
the distinguishing features, and to trace the precise boundaries of each
species.</P>
<P>The Siskin is smaller than the Goldfinch; its bill is
proportionally shorter, and its plumage is <PB N="189" REF="212"/> entirely
different: its head is not red, but black; its throat brown; the fore-part of
its neck, its breast, and the lateral quills of its tail, yellow; the belly
yellowish white; the under-part of the body olive-green, speckled with
black, which assumes a yellow cast on the rump, and still more yellow
on the superior coverts of the tail.</P>
<P>But in the more intimate qualities, which result directly from
organization or instinct, the differences are still greater. The Siskin
has a song peculiar to itself, and much inferior to that of the Goldfinch;
it is very fond of alder-seeds, which the Goldfinch will never touch, and the
Siskin, in its turn, is indifferent about thistle∣seeds: it creeps along
the branches, and suspends itself from their extremity like the
Titmouse:—In short, we might regard it as an intermediate species
to the Titmouse and Goldfinch. Besides, it is a bird of passage, and in
its migrations it flies at a great height, and is heard before it can be
seen; whereas the Goldfinch continues with us the whole year, and never flies
very high: lastly, these two birds are never observed to as∣sociate
together.</P>
<P>The Siskin can be taught like the Goldfinch, to draw up the
little bucket: it is equally docile, and though not so active, it is more
cheerful; for it begins always the earliest in the morning to warble, and to
rouze the other birds. But, as it has an unsuspicious temper, it is
easily de∣coyed into all sorts of snares, traps, springs, &amp;c. 
<PB N="190" REF="213"/> and it is more easily trained than any other bird
caught in the adult state. We need only to offer it habitually the proper
sort of food in the hand, and it will soon become as tame as the most
familiar Canary. We may even accustom it to perch upon the hand at the
sound of a bell; for if at first we ring at each meal, the subtle
association of perceptions, which obtains also among the animals, will
afterwards rouze it to the call. Though the Siskin appears to select its
food with care, it consumes much; but its voracious appetite is subordinate
to a noble pas∣sion: it has always in the volery some favourite of its
own species, or if that is not to be ob∣tained, a bird of another species,
which it che∣rishes and feeds with the fondness of a parent.—It
drinks often<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bird-catchers lay lime-twigs at the
sides of brooks, and are very successful in the capture.</NOTE>, but
seldom bathes; it only approaches the margin of the water and dips its bill
and breast, without much fluttering, except perhaps in hot weather.</P>
<P>It is said that it breeds on the islands in the Rhine, in
Franche-comté, in Switzerland, Greece, and Hungary, and that it prefers
the mountain forests. Its nest is very difficult to discover<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The bird-catchers in Orleans, says
Salerne, agree that the discovery of a Siskin's nest is a thing quite
unheard of. It is probable, however, that some continue in the country, and
breed near the banks of the Loiret, among the alders, of which they are very
fond; and the more so as young ones are some∣times caught with limed twigs
or in traps. M. Colombeau assures me, that he found a nest with five eggs
in the bleachfield of M. Hery de la Salle."</Q> Kramer tells us, that in the
forests skirted by the Danube, thousands of young Siskins are found,
which have not dropt their first feathers, and yet it is very rare to meet
with a nest. One day when he was botanizing with one of his friends about the
15th of June, they both saw a male and female Siskin often fly towards an
alder with food in their bills; but, though they searched with all
possible care, they could neither hear nor see the young
ones.</P></NOTE>, <PB N="191" REF="214"/> which has given rise to a vulgar
opinion, that the Siskin renders it invisible with a certain stone.
Accordingly, our accounts are imperfect in regard to that subject: Frisch
says that it conceals its nest in holes; Kramer supposes the bird
covers it with leaves, which is the reason that it is never found.—The
best way to ascertain the point, would be to observe how they proceed
when they breed in a volery; which, though the trial has not hitherto
succeeded, is still possible.</P>
<P>But it is more common to cross them with the Canaries. There
seems to be a great sympa∣thy between the two species; they shew a
reci∣procal fondness at the very first meeting, and intermix
indiscriminately<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Bougot, from whom I received
these remarks, has for five years seen a hen Canary breed thrice annually
with the same cock Canary, and the four following years twice annually with
another Canary, the first having died.</NOTE>. When a Siskin is paired with
a hen Canary, he eagerly shares her toils; he is busy in carying materials
for the nest, and arranging them; and regularly disgorges food for the
sitting female. But yet most of the eggs are addle: for the union of hearts
is not alone sufficient in generation, and the tem∣perament 
<PB N="192" REF="215"/> of the Siskin wants much of the warmth of the
Canary.—The Hybrids resemble both parents.</P>
<P>In Germany, the Siskins begin to migrate in October, or even
earlier; at this time they eat the hop seeds, to the great injury of the
proprietors, and the places where they halt are strewed with leaves. They
entirely disappear in December, and return in February<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Frisch.</BIBL></NOTE>. In Burgundy, they arrive at the
season of vintage, and repass when the trees are in flower: they are
particularly fond of the blossoms of the apple-tree.</P>
<P>In Provence, they leave the woods and de∣scend from the
mountains about the end of autumn. At that time, they appear in flocks of more
than two hundred, and sit all upon the same tree, or at a very little
distance from each other. The passage continues fifteen or twen∣ty days,
after which scarcely any more are seen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Note of the Marquis de Piolenc.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

<P>I. In the month of September last year, a bird was brought
to me that had been caught in a trap, and which must have been bred between
the Siskin and Canary; for it had the bill of the latter, and nearly the
plumage of the former: it had undoubtedly escaped from some volery. I had
no opportunity of hearing its song, or of obtaining progeny from it, since
it died in March following; but M. Guys informs me, that in general the warble
of these hybrids is varied and pleasant. The upper-part of the body was
mixed with gray, with brown, and with a little olive yellow; which last was
the principal colour behind the neck, and was almost pure on the rump, on the
fore-part of the neck, and of the breast as far as the thighs; lastly, it
bordered all the quills of the tail and wings, the ground of which was
blackish, and almost all the superior coverts of the wings.</P>
<P>Total length four inches and one-fourth; the bill three lines
and a half; the alar extent seven inches and a half; the tail twenty-two

<P>II. The NEW YORK SISKIN. We need only to compare this with the
European Siskin, to perceive that it is a variety resulting from the
difference of climate. It is rather larger, and has its bill somewhat
shorter than ours; it has a black cap; the yellow of the throat and breast
ascends behind the neck, and forms a short col∣lar; the same colour
borders most of the feathers on the highest part of the back, and appears
again on the lower-part of the back and on the rump; the superior coverts of
the tail are white; the quills of the tail and of the wings are of a fine
black, edged and tipt with white: all the under-part of the body is dirty
white. As the Siskins are roving birds, and fly very lofty, they may have
migrated into North America, and suffered some changes in their
plumage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Latham reckons this bird a variety of the

a yellow stripe. So far it much re∣sembles the European and the New York
Siskin, and its size and shape are the same. It is pro∣bably the same

<ITEM><HI>Les Tangaras,</HI> Buff.</ITEM>
</LIST></HEAD>
<P>IN the warm parts of America is found a very numerous genus of
birds, some of which are called <HI>Tangaras</HI> at Brazil; and
nomencla∣tors have adopted this name for all the species included. These
birds have been supposed by most travellers to be a kind of Sparrows; in
fact, they differ from the European Sparrows only by their colours, and by a
minute character, that the upper mandible is scolloped on both sides near
the point. They closely resemble the Sparrows in their instinctive
habits: they fly low and by jerks; their notes are for the most part harsh;
they may be also reckoned granivorous, for they live upon very small
fruits; they are social with each other, and, like the Sparrows, are so
familiar as to visit the dwellings: they settle in dry grounds, and never
in marshes; they lay two eggs, and sometimes, though rarely, three.</P>
<P>The Sparrows of Cayenne have seldom more eggs, while those
of Europe have five or six; and this difference is perceived in general
be∣tween birds of hot and those of temperate cli∣mates. The smalness of
the hatch is compen∣sated <PB N="202" REF="225"/> by its frequent repetition,
love being che∣rished and maintained by the continual and uni∣form
warmth.</P>
<P>The whole genus of Tanagres, of which we know more than thirty
species, exclusive of va∣rieties, seems confined to the new continent;
for all those which we have received were brought from Guiana and other
countries of America, and not from Africa or India. This multitude of species
is not surprising; for, in general, the number of birds in the torrid zone
is perhaps ten times greater than in other regions, because nature is there
more prolific, and less disturbed in her operations by the interference of
man; because forests are there more frequent, sub∣sistence is more
plentiful, and the colds of win∣ter are unknown; and the natives of the
tro∣pical countries, rioting in a perpetual abundance, are totally exempted
from the risks and dangers of a migration, and seldom are obliged even to
shift from one haunt to another.</P>
<P>To avoid confusion, we shall range the thirty species of
Tanagres into three divisions, adopting the characters from the most
obvious difference, that of size.</P>

Fourthly, and lastly, The Brazilian Black-bird of Belon, which received that
name from those who first imported it into France. Aldro∣vandus has copied
Belon. The descriptions coin∣cide in every respect, except in the songs
of these birds; and I observed that those which chanted were larger, had
a brighter red tinge on the plumage, and also on the superior coverts of
the wings, &amp;c. which makes it very probable that they were the males;
indeed in almost all kinds of birds it is the males that are musical.</P>
<P>It would also appear, that in the male the feathers on the
head are longer, and form a sort of crest, as Edwards has figured it. This
has led some travellers to say that there are two kinds of Cardinals in
Mexico; one crested, which sings agreeably, and the other smaller, which
sings not at all.</P>
<P>These birds belong to the warm climates of Mexico, Peru, and
Brazil; but are rare in Gui∣ana. Belon tells us that in his time the mer∣chants
who traded to Brazil drew considerable <PB N="207" REF="231"/> profit from the
importation of them. Probably the feathers were employed to ornament the robes
and other dresses then in fashion, and these birds were more numerous
than at present.</P>
<P>We may presume that when travellers talk of the warble of
the Cardinal, they mean the Scar∣let Tanagre; for the <HI>Crested
Cardinal</HI> is of the genus of the Grosbeaks, and consequently a silent
bird. With regard to this point Salerne contradicts himself in the same
page. It is uni∣versally admitted that this Tanagre has an agree∣able warble,
and is susceptible even of instruc∣tion. Fernandez relates that it is
found parti∣cularly at Totonocapa in Mexico, and sings delightfully.</P>
<P>We reckon the following varieties of this
species:—</P>
<P>First, <HI>The Spotted Cardinal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cardinalis Naevius,</HI> Briss.</NOTE>, mentioned by
Brisson, which differs from the Scarlet Tanagre only because some
feathers of its back and breast are edged with green, which forms spots of
the same colour, and of a crescent shape. Aldro∣vandus calls this <HI>The
Short-tailed Blackbird.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>The Collared Cardinal</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cardinalis Torquatus,</HI> Briss.</NOTE>, mentioned by
Brisson. It has not only the same size and colours as the Scarlet
Tanagre, but the small coverts, and the edges of the quills of the wings are
blue, and on each side of the neck are two great spots of the same
colour, they are conti∣guous, <PB N="208" REF="232"/> and shaped like a
crescent. But Brisson copies his descriptions of the Collared and
Spot∣ted Cardinal from Aldrovandus, who saw only the figures of these two
birds, which renders their very existence doubtful. Indeed I should not
have taken notice of them, did not the no∣menclators insert them in their
catalogues.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Mexican bird which Hernan∣dez calls <HI>The
Parrot-coloured Mexican bird,</HI> and which Brisson describes under the
name of <HI>Mexican Cardinal.</HI> Hernandez says only, 
<Q REND="inline">"This bird, from the lower part of the bill
(which is somewhat hooked, and entirely cinereous) as far as the tail,
including the whole of the belly, is of a minium tinge. The same colour is
spread over the rump, and part of the back; but near the wings it receives a
greenish tinge that gradually increases from thence to the neck, which is
quite green. The head has an amethystine or hya∣cinthine tinge. The circle
which surrounds the pupil is very white, and the orbits of a deep coerulean.
The origin of the wings is yellowish; their quills hyacinthine, and marked
with a greenish streak. The tail is entirely amethys∣tine, without any
mixture of green, and more dilute near the end. The legs, which have three toes
before, and one behind, are of a cinereous∣violet."</Q></P>
<P>These birds fly in flocks, and are easily caught with
nooses, and other snares. They are readily tamed; are fat, and good to

consists of twelve black quills, terminated by a small border of light
white; the lateral quills are rather longer than those of the middle, which

hear this Cardinal in the forests, and in winter only on the banks of rivers

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Twelfth Species.</HEAD>
<P>The French settlers in Cayenne have given this bird the name
of <HI>Silver-Bill (Bec-d' Argent),</HI> which expresses a remarkable
specific character; viz. that the base of the lower mandible ex∣tends under
the eyes, and forms on each side a thick plate, which, when the bird is
alive, looks like the brightest silver; but this lustre tarnishes after
death. It is imperfectly represented in the <HI>Planches
Enluminées.</HI> Edwards has given an ex∣cellent figure of this bird
under the name of <HI>Red-breasted Black-bird;</HI> he is deceived indeed in
regard to the genus, but he has hit the dis∣criminating features.</P>
<P>The total length is six inches and a half, and that of the
bill nine lines, which is black on the <PB N="216" REF="240"/> upper-part; the
head, throat, and breast, are purple, and the rest of the body black, with
some purple tints. The iris is brown. The fe∣male differs from the male, not
only in the colour of its bill, but in those of its plumage; the upper-part
of its body is brown, with some shades of obscure purple, and the
under-part reddish; the tail and wings are brown.</P>
<P>Another discriminating character of the male, is a sort of
half collar round the occiput, formed by long purple bristles, which project
near three lines beyond the feathers. We are indebted to Sonini for this
remark; and also for our ac∣quaintance with this and all the other Tanagres
of Guiana.</P>
<P>This bird is more numerous than any of the Tanagres in the
Island of Cayenne and in Guiana; and it probably occurs in many other warm
countries of America, for Fernandez gives the same account of a Mexican bird
that fre∣quents the vicinity of the mountains of Tepuz∣cullula. It feeds upon
small fruits, and also upon the large pulpy produce of the bananas, &amp;c.
when they are ripe; but eats no insects. It haunts the clearest spots,
and does not shun the neighbourhood of dwellings, and even visits the
gardens. However, the Red-breasted Tana∣gres are also very common in
desert tracts, and even in the glades of the forests; for in spots where
the trees are levelled by the hurricanes, and where the sun darts his burning
rays, there <PB N="217" REF="241"/> are generally some of these birds,
though al∣ways in pairs, and never in flocks.</P>
<P>Their nest is cylindrical, and somewhat curved, which they
fasten horizontally between the branches, the entrance being below; so that
the rain, from whatever direction it beats, can∣not penetrate. It is six
inches long, and four inches and a half in diameter; it is constructed with
straws and the dry leaves of the Indian flowering reed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Canna Indica,</HI> Linn.</NOTE>, and the bottom is well lined
with broader portions of the same leaves:—it is generally fixed in the
loftiest trees. The female lays two elliptical eggs, which are white, and
covered at the thick end with small spots of light red, which melts away as
it approaches the other end.</P>
<P>Some nomenclators have given this bird the name of Cardinal,
but improperly: others have supposed that there is an obvious variety in
this species. In Mauduit's cabinet we saw a bird whose plumage is pale
rose-colour, variegated with gray; I am rather inclined to think, that this
difference is occasioned by moulting.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific

<P>This Tanagre is called the <HI>Slave</HI> in Saint Do∣mingo;

larger and stronger than this bird, which also feeds on insects.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Sixth Middle Species.</HEAD>
<P>The plumage is variegated with seven co∣lours: fine green on
the head, and the small superior coverts of the wings; glossy black on
the upper-parts of the neck and back, on the middle quills of the wings, and on
the upper <PB N="229" REF="254"/> surface of the quills of the tail; brilliant
fire-colour on the back; orange-yellow on the rump; violet-blue on the throat,
the lower-part of the neck, and the great superior coverts of the wings; deep
gray on the under-surface of the tail; and, lastly, fine sea-green on all
the under-part of the body from the breast. These colours are all
exceed∣ingly bright, and well defined.</P>
<P>It does not assume the vivid red on the back till grown
up, and the female never has that co∣lour; the lower-part of her back too is
orange like the rump, and in general her tints are more dilute, and not so
distinctly desined as those of the male—But there is still some
diversity in the disposition of the colours; some males have the bright
red on the rump as well as on the back; and in many others both the back and
rump are entirely of a gold colour.</P>
<P>The male and female are nearly of the same size, being
five inches long; the bill only six lines, and the legs eight lines; the tail
is some∣what forked, and the wings reach to the middle of it.</P>
<P>These birds appear in numerous flocks. They feed upon the
tender half-formed fruits which grow on a certain large tree in Guiana. They
arrive in the island of Cayenne when this tree is in blossom, and depart
soon afterwards, pene∣trating probably into the interior parts of the country
when the same fruits are later in com∣ing to maturity. They make their
appearance in <PB N="230" REF="255"/> the inhabited parts of Guiana commonly
about the middle of September, and stay about six weeks; they return again
in April or May. Indeed they seem to seek always the same food; and when
any of those trees is in blow, we may certainly expect to find a number of
these birds.</P>
<P>They breed not during their residence in Gui∣ana. Marcgrave
tells us that in Brazil they are kept in the cage, and fed on meal and bread.
They have no warble, and their cry is short and sharp.</P>
<P>We must not with Brisson range the <HI>Talao</HI> with
this species; for the description given by Seba is not at all applicable to
it: 
<Q REND="inline">"The Talao," says Seba, "has its plumage
beautifully varie∣gated with pale green, with black, with yellow, and with
white; the feathers of the head and breast are finely shaded with pale
green, and with black; and the bill, the legs, and the toes, are deep
black."</Q> Besides, what demonstratively proves it to be not the same
bird, the author adds, that it is very rare in Mexico; whereas the Paradise
Tanagres we have seen arrive there in very great numbers.</P>

glossy black, which extends on each side of the neck in a black bar,

fruit that grows on a large tree, on which it perches in flocks; and again

<HEAD>The ORGANIST.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Third Small Species.</HEAD>
<P>Such is the name this little bird receives at St. Domingo;
because it sounds all the notes of the octave, rising from the base to
the treble. This sort of song, which implies that the ear of this bird is
organized similarly to the human ear, is not only singular, but very
pleasant. The Chevalier Fabre Deshayes has informed me in a letter, that in
the south of St. Domingo on the high mountains, there is a small bird very
rare and famous, called the <HI>Musician,</HI> whose song can be written.
We presume that this is the same with the <HI>Organist.</HI> But still
we should doubt of the regular succession of musical sounds; for we
had not the bird alive. It was presented by the Count de Noë, who had
brought it from the Spanish district of St. Domingo, where he told me it
was very rare, and difficult to discover, or to shoot; because it is
shy, and artfully con∣ceals itself; it even turns round the branch as the
hunter changes place, to elude his view: so that though there be several of
these birds on a tree, it often happens that not one of them can be
perceived.</P>
<P>The length four inches; the plumage blue on the head and neck;
the back, the wings, and the tail, are stained with black, running 
<PB N="236" REF="262"/> into coarse blue; the forehead, the rump, and all the
upper-part of the body, coloured with orange-colour.—This short
description is suffi∣cient to discriminate it.</P>
<P>We find in Dupratz's History of Louisiana, the
description of a small bird which he calls <HI>Bishop,</HI> and which we
believe to be the same with the <HI>Organist.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Bishop is a bird smaller than the
Canary; its plumage is blue, verging on violet.—It feeds on many sorts
of small seeds, among these <HI>widlogouil</HI> and
<HI>choupi∣choul,</HI> a kind of millet peculiar to the country. Its notes are
so flexible, its warble so tender, that when we once hear it, we become
more reserved in our eulogiums on this nightingale. Its song lasts during
a <HI>Miserere,</HI> and during the whole time it never makes an
inspiration; it rests twice as long before it renews its music, the whole
interval elapsed being about two hours."</Q></P>
<P>Though Dupratz does not mention whether it gives the notes of
the octaves as the Organist is said to do, we cannot doubt their identity;
for the colours and size are the same in both. The Scarlet Tanagre, which
resembles it in point of song, is twice as large; and the Arada, which has
also a charming warble, is entirely brown. The Organist is then the only
bird to which it can be referred.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fourth Small Species.</HEAD>
<P>This bird was called <HI>Jacarini</HI> by the Brazilians.
Marcgrave mentions it, but takes no notice of its habits. However, Sonini de
Manoncour, who observed it in Guiana, where it is very common, informs us
that it prefers the cleared grounds, and is never seen in the large
forests; that it lodges in the low trees, particularly the coffee∣tree, and
is distinguished by a singular circum∣stance, viz. that it springs
from the branch on which it has perched a foot, or a foot and a half
vertically, and falls back to the same spot; and thus continues to rise
and sink alternately, till it removes to another bush, where it repeats the
same exercise. Each leap is attended with a seeble cry, expressive of
pleasure, and by an ex∣pansion of the tail. This would seem to be the
mode in which the male courts the female; which on the contrary remains at
ease, or hops about like other birds. The nest is composed of dry herbs
of a gray colour; it is hemispheri∣cal, and two inches in diameter; the
female deposits in it two elliptical eggs, seven or eight lines long, and
of a greenish white, sprinkled <PB N="238" REF="264"/> with small red
spots, which are numerous, and spread most profusely near the big
end.</P>
<P>The Jacarini is easily known by its colour, which is black,
and shining like polished steel, and uniform over the whole body, except
only in the male the interior coverts of the wings, which are whitish; for
the female is entirely gray, and differs so much in plumage that it might be
taken for a different species. The male also be∣comes gray in the
moult.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Tanagra

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fifth Small Species.</HEAD>
<P>It is called <HI>Teité</HI> in its native region of
Brazil. The female differs widely from the male; for the upper-part of the body
is olive-green; the forehead, and the under-part of the bill, tinged partly
with yellow, and partly with olive-yellow: whereas in the male the body is of a
deep blue; and the forehead, the under-part of the throat and belly, fine
yellow.</P>
<P>In the young bird the colours are somewhat different. The
upper-part of the body is olive, <PB N="239" REF="265"/> sprinkled with some
feathers of a deep blue; and on the front the yellow is not distinctly
marked. The feathers are only gray, with a little yellow at the tips; the
under-side of the body is of as fine a yellow in the young bird as in the
adult.</P>
<P>The same changes of plumage are observed in this as in the
preceding species. The nest is also very like that of the Jacarini, only
it is not of so close a texture, and is composed of reddish herbs
instead of gray. There is a variety of it, which, as well as the species,
is called <HI>Little Louis</HI> by the Creoles of Cayenne. They are both very
com∣mon in Guiana, Surinam, and Brazil; they fre∣quent the ground cleared near
the farm-house, and feed on the small fruits which they find on the
bushes; they light in great numbers among rice-crops, which must be guarded
against their visits.</P>
<P>They may be bred in the cage, where they are pleasant, if

with∣out pretending to decide the species.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>First, <HI>The Grass bird,</HI> or <HI>Xiuhtototl</HI> of

those of the tail black, and tipt <PB N="241" REF="267"/> with white; the
under-part of the wings cine∣reous, the upper-part variegated with blue, with
fulvous and with black; the bill short, somewhat thick, and of a rusty
white; the legs are gray.</P>
<P>This author adds, that it is somewhat larger than our
House-sparrow, that it is good eating, that it is raised in the cage, and
that its song is not unpleasant.—It is impossible from such an
imperfect account to decide whether it belongs to the genus of Tanagres.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Coerulean Tanagre</HI> of Latham, the <HI>Tanagra
Canora</HI> of Gmelin, and the <HI>Tanagra Coerulea Novae Hispaniae</HI> of

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Secondly, <HI>The Mexican Bird</HI> of Seba, <HI>of the size
of a Sparrow.</HI> The whole body is blue, varied with purple, except the
wings, which are varied with red and black; the head is round; the eyes and the
breast are covered above and below with a blackish down; the inferior
co∣verts of the wings, and of the tail, are yellowish ash-colour. It is
ranged among the singing birds.</P>
<P>So vague an account cannot warrant us to conclude that it
belongs to the genus of the Tanagres; for the only points of analogy are that
it inhabits Mexico, and is of the size of a Sparrow: and Seba's figure, as
indeed all those of that author, can convey no distinct idea.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Thirdly, <HI>The Brazilian Guira-Perea</HI> of Marc∣grave. It
is about the bulk of a Lark; its bill black, short, and rather thick; all the
upper-part of the body, and the belly, of a deep yel∣low, <PB N="242" REF="268"/> spotted with black; the under-part of the head and neck, the
throat, and the breast, black; the wings and tail composed of quills of
blackish brown, and some edged exteriorly with green; the legs are of a
dull cinereous.</P>
<P>It does not appear from this short description whether
this bird ought to be referred to the Bulfinches or to the Tanagres.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Yellow Tanagre</HI> of Latham, the <HI>Tanagra

<P>Fourthly, <HI>The Bird smaller than the Goldfinch,</HI> or
<HI>the Quatoztli of Brazil,</HI> according to Seba. The half of its head is
decorated with a white crest; the neck is of a light red, and the breast of
a fine purple; the wings deep red and purple; the back and the tail yellowish
black, and the belly light yellow; the bill and legs are yellow. Seba adds,
that it inhabits the mountains of <HI>Tet∣zocano</HI> in Brazil.</P>
<P>We shall observe, first, that the name
<HI>Qua∣toztli,</HI> which Seba gives to this bird, is not Bra∣zilian, but
Mexican; and secondly, that the mountains of <HI>Tetzocano</HI> are in
Mexico, and not in Brazil. It is probable therefore that he was mistaken in
calling it a Brazilian bird.</P>
<P>Lastly, from the description and the figure given by Seba,
we should rather range this bird in the genus of the Manakins than in that of
the Tanagres.<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>White-headed

spot; the quills of the wings variegated with green, with deep blue, and with

white; the tail is of a beautiful form, brown terminated with rufous.</P>
<P>Seba adds, that this bird, which was sent from Amboyna, is
of an elegant figure (his plate is a very bad one), and that its song is
also pleasant. This is enough to exclude the <HI>Calatti</HI> from the
Tanagres, which are found only in America, and in no part of the East
Indies.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Amboina Tanagre</HI> of Latham,

the toes and nails very long.</P>
<P>Hernandez subjoins in a corollary, that this bird has a
black-hooked bill, and that if it were more curved, and if the toes were placed
as in the parrots, he should not hesitate to regard it as a real
parrot.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="270"/> From these indications, we should

<P>We cannot refer this bird to any genus, and we place it after
the Tanagres only because its exterior appearance is similar; but its
habits are totally different. It never appears in the cleared spots, and
remains always alone in the heart of the forests far from settlements, and
has no song or cry. It rather hops than flies, and seldom rests on the
lowest branches of the bushes, for it commonly continues on the ground. It

same way as the Rails, the Snipes, and other migratory birds<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hist. Anim. <HI>Lib.</HI> viii.

<P N="2">2. The <HI>Cenchramus</HI> utters cries during the night;
which has given to these naturalists oc∣casion to say, that it
continually calls to the <PB N="246" REF="273"/> companions of its journey, and
encourages them to advance.</P>
<P N="3">3. Lastly, in the time of Varro, the <HI>Miliariae,</HI>
as well as the Quails and Thrushes, were fat∣tened, and sold at high prices
to the luxurious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Re Rustica, <HI>Lib.</HI>
iii. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>All these properties belong to our Ortolan:—It is a bird
of passage, which a multitude of naturalists and of fowlers admit: it
sings during the night, as Kramer, Frisch, and Salerne affirm<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I could cite also the Sieur Burel, gardener at
Lyons, who has sometimes above an hundred Ortolans in his volery, and who
com∣municated to me, or confirmed, many peculiarities of their
history.</NOTE>: and lastly, when fat, it is esteemed a delicious
morsel<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is pretended those caught in the
plains of Toulouse are better flavoured than those of Italy. In winter they
are very scarce, and consequently very dear: they are dispatched to Paris
by post in a small trunk filled with millet, according to the historian
of Languedoc, <HI>tome</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 46; in the same manner as they are
sent from Bologna and Florence to Rome in boxes full of corn, ac∣cording to
Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. The Ortolans are not always caught fat; but there is an
in∣fallible method to bring them into that state. They are shut up in a
room from which the ex∣ternal light is excluded, but which is constantly
illuminated with lanthorns, so that they cannot distinguish the night
from the day: they are allowed to run about and pick up the oats and millet
that are regularly scattered in the apart∣ment. With this regimen they soon
grow excessively fat, and if not prevented would even die of extreme
corpulence<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It has been said that they are
sometimes fattened to weigh three ounces.</NOTE>. When killed at the proper
time, they are most delicate, delici∣ous <PB N="247" REF="274"/> balls of fat,
but rather too luscious, and apt to cloy.—Thus Nature guards against
intempe∣rance by the satiety and disgust which constantly attend the
excess of pleasure.</P>
<P>The fat Ortolans are easily dressed in the water-bath, the
sand-bath, in hot ashes, &amp;c. And they may be also very well prepared
in the shell of a real or an artificial egg, as was for∣merly practised
with the beccafigos or epicurean warblers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Petronius.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that the delicacy of their flesh, or
rather of their fat, has contributed more to their celebrity, than the charms
of their warble. However, when kept in the cage, they have a song like that
of the Yellow Bunting, which, as I have already observed, they repeat night
and day. In countries where they are numerous, and consequently well known,
as in Lombardy, they are not only fattened for the table, but trained to
sing; and Salerne observes that there is a sweetness in their notes. In
this case they are better treated, and not being suffered to grow
corpulent, their lives are prolonged. If they are kept a considerable time
beside other birds, they adopt something of their song, especially when
they are young; but I know not whether they ever learn to articulate words, or
catch the notes of our music.</P>
<P>These birds make their appearance at the same time with our
Swallow, or a little after, and they <PB N="248" REF="275"/> either accompany or
precede the Quails. They enter Lower Provence, and advance as far as Burgundy,
especially in the warm districts, which are planted with vineyards;
however, they touch not the grapes, but eat the insects that prey upon the
leaves and tendrils of the vines. On their arrival, they are rather lean,
because then is the season of their loves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They
may however be fatted at this time, by feeding them first with oats, then
with hemp-seed, with millet, &amp;c.</NOTE>. They build in the vines, and
their nests are pretty regular, and similar to those of the lark: they
lay four or five grayish eggs, and have commonly two hatches in the year. In
other countries, as in Lorraine, they place their nests on the ground, and
prefer the corn-fields.</P>
<P>The young family begins to direct its course to the southern
provinces as early as the first of August; but the parents do not commence
their journey before the end of September. They remove into Fores, and halt in
the neighbour∣hood of St. Chaumont and St. Etienne; they alight among the oats,
of which they are very fond, and remain till the cold weather be∣gins to set
in; during which time they become so fat and inactive, that they might be
knocked down with sticks. At this time they are proper for the table,
especially the young ones; but they are more difficult to preserve than
those which are caught in their first entrance. In Bearn also, the
Ortolans appear twice annually; passing in May, and repassing in
October.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="276"/> Some have supposed these birds to
be natives of Italy, whence they spread into Germany and other countries; and
this is not improbable: for though they breed at present in Germany, they are
caught promiscuously with the Buntings and Chaffinches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch.—Kramer ranks them among the birds which occur in
Lower Austria; and he adds, that they live in the fields, and perch upon the
trees which grow in the midst of meadows.</NOTE>; but Italy has been
cultivated from a more remote antiquity. Besides, it is not uncommon for
these birds, when they dis∣cover a suitable country, to adopt it and
settle in it. Not many years since, they were thus naturalized in a small
district of Lorraine, lying between Dieuse and Mulée; where they
breed, raise their young, depart in the fall, and return again in the
spring<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dr. Lottinger.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But their journies are not confined to Ger∣many; Linnaeus
relates that they inhabit Swe∣den, and fixes the month of March for the period
of their migration<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fauna
Suecica.</BIBL></NOTE>. We must not how∣ever suppose that they are
spread through all the countries between Sweden and Italy: they return
constantly into our southern provinces; sometimes their course lies
through Picardy, but scarcely are they ever seen in the northern part of
Burgundy where I live, in Brie, or in Swit∣zerland, &amp;c.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gesner.</BIBL></NOTE> They may be caught either with the

<P>UPON comparing the different birds of this fa∣mily, I have
perceived so many striking re∣lations between that of the present article
and those of the four following, that I should have referred them all to
the same species, if I could have collected a sufficient number of facts
to justify this innovation. It is extremely probable that all these would
propagate with each other, and that the cross-breed would be prolific. But
still I observe that they continue for a length of time in the same
country without intermixing; that they retain their discriminating
characters; and that their instincts are not quite the same. I shall
therefore follow the common division, but protest against the
multiplication of the number of species, which is so fertile a source of
error and confusion.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="281"/> The Reed Ortolans delight in fens, and
nestle among the rushes; however, they sometimes resort to the high
grounds in rainy seasons. In spring they are seen by the sides of the
roads, and in August they feed in the corn fields. Kra∣mer tells us that they
are fondest of millet. In general they seek their food like the Buntings,
along the hedges, and in the cultivated spots. They keep near the ground, and
seldom perch except on the bushes. They never assemble in flocks, and
scarcely more than three or four are seen at once. They arrive in Lorraine
about the month of April, and depart in au∣tumn; however, there are always
some of them which continue in that province during the winter.—They
are found in Sweden, Germany, England, France, and sometimes in Italy,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>This little bird is almost perpetually on the watch, to
discover its foe, and when it de∣scries some fowlers, it makes an
incessant cry, which is not only teazing, but sometimes scares away the
game. I have seen sportsmen quite out of patience at the notes of this
bird, which are somewhat like those of the Sparrow. The Reed Bunting has
besides a pleasant warble in the time of hatching, about the month of
May.</P>
<P>This bird jerks its tail upwards and down∣wards as quick as the
Wagtails, and with more animation.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="282"/> In the male, the upper-part of the head
is black; the throat and the fore-part of the neck variegated with black and
rusty gray; a white collar on the upper-part of the neck only; a sort of
eye-brow and a bar of the same colour under the eyes; the upper-part of the
body variegated with rufous and black; the rump and the superior coverts of
the tail variegated with gray and rusty; the under-part of the body white,
shaded with rusty; the sides slightly spotted with blackish; the
quills of the wings brown, edged with different shades of rufous; the quills
of the tail the same, except the two outermost on each side, which are
edged with white; the bill is brown, and the legs are of a dark

<P>THE mountains of Spitzbergen, the Lapland Alps, the shores of
Hudson's-bay, and per∣haps countries still more northerly, are, during the
summer months, the favourite abodes of this bird. The excessive
severity of these inhospitable climates changes part of its plumage into
white in winter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Those white feathers are black
at the base; and sometimes the black shines through the white, and forms
a multitude of little spots, as in the individual painted by Frisch, under
the name of <HI>The Spotted White Bunting.</HI> At other times the black collar
of the base of each feather extends on a great part of the wing; so that a
blackish colour is thus produced over all the under-side of the body, as in
the Blackish and Yellowish Finch of Aldrovandus. 
<BIBL><HI>Lib. XVIII. pp.</HI> 817, 818.</BIBL></NOTE>. It has
some variety of appearance from the diversified intermixture of white,
black, or rusty; and the combinations of these colours are affected by the
season, and by the tempera∣ture of the air.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="294"/> In winter the head, the neck, the coverts
of the wings, and all the under-part of the body, are in the male white as
snow, with a light and almost transparent tint of rusty on the head
only; the back black; the quills of the wings, and of the tail, partly black,
partly white. In summer the head, the neck, the under-part of the body, and
even the back, are stained with transverse rusty waves of various
intensity, but never so deep as in the female, of which it is the
predominant colour, and disposed in longitudinal stripes. In some
subjects the neck is cinereous, the back cinereous variegated with brown; a
purple tinge round the eyes; a reddish cast on the head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Schwenckfeld.</BIBL></NOTE>, &amp;c. The colour of the bill
is also variable; sometimes yellow, sometimes cinereous at the base,
and generally black at the point. In all, the nostrils are round, somewhat
pro∣minent, and covered with small feathers; the tongue is a little forked;
the eyes are small and black; the legs black, or blackish.</P>
<P>These birds leave their mountains when the snows and
frosts will not permit them to pro∣cure their food. This is the same with
that of the white grous, and consists of the seeds of a species of
birch<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Betula Nana,</HI> or <HI>Dwars
Birch,</HI> a native of the arctic re∣gions.</NOTE>, and of other seeds. When
kept in the cage they are very well reconciled to oats, and pluck the heads
very expertly, <PB N="264" REF="295"/>

green-pease, hemp-seed, millet, the seeds of dodder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cuscuta Europaea.</HI> LINN.</NOTE>; but hemp-seed fattens
them too fast, and occasions their death.</P>
<P>They return in spring to their icy summits. Though they do
not always hold the same route, they are commonly seen in Sweden, in
Saxony, in Lower Silefia, in Poland, in Red Russia, in Podolia, and in
Yorkshire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby killed one in
Lincolnshire. Ray says that numbers of them are caught during winter in
Yorkshire. Johnson informed Willughby that some are seen on the chain
of the Northumbrian mountains.</NOTE>. They are very rare in the south of
Germany, and almost en∣tirely unknown in Switzerland and Italy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gesner and Aldrovandus.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the time of their passage they keep con∣stantly along
the roads, picking up small seeds, and every sort of food. This is the
proper sea∣son for catching them. They are prized on account of the
singularity of their plumage, and the delicacy of their flesh, and not for
the sake of their song, which consists in an unmeaning cluck, or in a
shrill cry resembling that of the Jay, which they utter when handled: but
to judge fairly of their warble, we ought to hear them in the season of
love, when the warmth of passion inspires, and softens the native
strains. We are ignorant also of the particulars of their breeding: it is
undoubtedly in the countries where they spend the summer, but there are not
many observers in the Lapland Alps.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="298"/> These birds do not perch; they continue
al∣ways on the ground, where they run and trip about like our Larks, to which
they are similar also in their port, in their size, in their long
spurs, &amp;c. but differ in the shape of the bill and tongue, in their
plumage, in their migrations, in their arctic abodes, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some able naturalists have ranged the Snow Ortolan with the
Larks; but Linnaeus has with great propriety referred it to the
Buntings.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is observed that they sleep little or none in the night,
and begin to hop by the earliest dawn. Perhaps this is the reason why they
prefer the lofty mountains of the north in summer, where the day lasts the
whole season.</P>
<P>Total length six inches and a half; the bill five lines; on
the palate is a small tubercle that distinguishes the genus; the hind-toe
is equal to that of the middle, and the nail is much longer, and less hooked;
the alar extent eleven inches and one fourth; the tail two inches and
two-thirds, somewhat forked, consisting of twelve quills, and projecting
ten lines beyond the wings.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">

Nivalis:—</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Its wing-quills are white, the primaries

birds are of the size of the Chaffinch. They probably breed in Spitzbergen,
and certainly in Greenland, where they make their nests in the fissures
of the mountain rocks, employing grass for the outside, feathers for the
inside, and the down of the arctic fox for lining. They lay five white eggs,
spotted with brown. They sing sweetly, sitting on the ground.</P> 
<P>In autumn the Snow Buntings issue from their frozen
retreats, and visit the northern parts of Europe. They appear in Sweden in
severe weather, and are thence called <HI>Ill-vars-vogel,</HI> and
<HI>Hard-vars-fogel;</HI> and many are caught near the sea-shores. They
enter Britain by the north of Scotland; at first they are lean, but soon
grow fat and delicious; the Highlands abound with them.</P> 
<P>The Snow Buntings appear also at Hudson's-bay in April,
retire northward in May to breed, and pay another visit in September. They
live in vast flocks, feed on grass-seeds, &amp;c. and are easily
caught.</P>

throat, and neck, are white. It has two sorts of collars at the under-part of
the neck; the upper lead-colour, the lower blue; both se∣parated by the
ground colour, which forms a sort of white intermediate collar; the quills of
the wings are white, tinctured with a greenish yel∣low, and strewed with
some black feathers; the eight quills of the middle of the tail, and the two
outer ones, white; the two others black; all the rest of the plumage

<P>Kramer observes that in the Ortolans, as well as in the
Yellow Buntings, the Chaffinches, and Bulfinches, the two mandibles are
moveable; and this is the reason, he says, why they shell the seeds,
and do not swallow them entire.</P>

<P>THESE birds are migratory birds, and the motive of their
passage is not known. Numerous flocks of them are seen or rather heard in
the month of September, coming from the Island of Cuba, where the rice has
already at∣tained maturity, and directing their course to Ca∣rolina, where it
is only coming into ear. These remain in Carolina only three weeks, and then
advance towards the north, always in search of more tender grain: and, by
successive stations, they penetrate as far as Canada, and perhaps
beyond. But what is the most singular, though there are other similar
instances, these flocks are composed entirely of females. It is
ascertained, we are told, from numerous diffections, that only the females
pass in September; but in the beginning of the spring, the males and
females are intermingled; and indeed, this is the season of the union of
the sexes.</P>
<P>The plumage of the females is rusty over al∣most its whole
body; that of the males is more <PB N="271" REF="302"/> diversified: the
fore-part of the head and neck, the throat, the breast, and all the
under-part of the body, the upper-part of the back and the thighs, black, with
a mixture of rusty; the back of the head and neck rusty; the lower-part of
the back and rump of an olive cinereous; the great superior coverts of the
wings of the same colour, edged with whitish; the small superior
coverts of the wings, and the superior coverts of the tail, dirty white; the
quills of the wing black, tipt with brown, and edged, the great ones with
sulphur-colour, and the small ones with gray; the quills of the tail are
nearly like the great quills of the wings, only all terminate in points<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For this reason we have called the bird
<HI>Agripenne.</HI></NOTE>; lastly, the bill is cinereous, and the legs
brown. This Ortolan is remarked to be taller than the rest.</P>
<P>Total length six inches and three-fourths; the bill six
lines and a half; the alar extent four inches; the tail two inches and a half,
somewhat forked, and exceeding the wings by ten lines.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Rice Bunting, <HI>Emberiza

<Q REND="inline">"Black, the neck tawny, the belly black, the

in Carolina before the end of last century, when that nutritious grain was
introduced from Madagascar. We may suppose that a few stray birds had
been driven into that province by adverse winds, and had fared so well
among the rice-crops, as to have re∣turned with their brood the ensuing
season: and thus, in the course of a few years, a direction would be
given to their general mi∣grations. They arrive in Carolina about September; at
first they are very lean, but soon grow excessively fat, and fly with
difficulty, so that they are easily shot. Their stay lasts three
weeks; and both sexes make a transient visit in the spring. A few
remain through the winter in Carolina, and even in Virginia, where they
subsist on the scattered grains of Indian corn.</NOTE></P>

<P>I consider this as a variety of the preceding, produced by
the influence of climate: its size, its port, its shape are the same, and
the quills of the tail are likewise pointed, the only difference, in short,

throat and all the under-part of the body of a light yellow, which is still
more dilute on the lower-belly; the upper-part of the head and of the body, and
the small superior coverts of the wings, are of an olive-brown; the rump

<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE YELLOW HAMMER.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="275" REF="307"/> ground, below a clod, in a
bush, or in a tuft of grass, but always carelessly. Sometimes it builds
in the low branches of shrubs, and is then at more pains. The body of the
nest consists of straws, moss, and dry leaves, and is lined with
roots, the finest straws, hair, and wool. The eggs are generally four or
five, spotted with brown of different shade, on a white ground; but the
spots are thicker at the large end. The female covers with such ardent
attachment, that often she can be caught by the hand in broad day. The young
are fed with small seeds, in∣sects, and even May-flies; but of these
last, the hard crust sheathing the wings is previously se∣parated by
the parents. They are however granivorous, and fondest of millet and
hemp∣seed. They can be caught by a noose baited with a head of oats; but
cannot be decoyed, it is said, by the call. In summer they haunt the trees,
the sides of the hedges and bushes; some∣times they visit the
vineyards, but scarcely ever penetrate into the heart of the forests. In
win∣ter, a part of them migrate into other climates, and those which remain
behind assemble and join the Chaffinches, Sparrows, &amp;c. forming very
numerous flocks, especially in rainy weather. They resort to the farms, and
even to the villages and high roads, picking up their subsistence among
the bushes, and even in horse-dung, &amp;c. and in that season they are

branch. Their ordinary cry consists of seven notes, six of which are
equal, and of the same tone, and the last sharper and prolonged,

associate. Frisch relates that they adopt something of the song of
the Canary when they hear it young: he adds, that the cross breed of the cock
Bunting and hen Canary chants better than the father. Lastly, Guys says,
that the song of the cock Bunting grows pleasant on the approach of the
month of August. Aldrovandus also speaks of its fine warble.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Yellow Buntings are spread over the whole of Europe, from
Sweden to Italy, and through all the interjacent countries; and they are
consequently exposed to great difference of temperature, which happens to
most birds in any degree domestic.</P>

the head and on the lower-part of the body; but on the head this colour is
va∣riegated with brown; it is pure yellow on the sides of the head, under the

<PB N="277" REF="309"/> wings, and it is mixed with light chesnut on all the
rest of the lower part; the neck and the small superior coverts of the
wings are olive; the middle and large coverts of the wings, the back, and even
the four first quills of the wings are blackish; the rest are brown, and
edged, the two outer with white, and the ten others with whitish gray;
lastly, their superior coverts are light chesnut, terminated with
whitish gray. The female has not so much yellow as the male, and is more
spotted on the neck, the breast, and the belly: in both, the edges of the
lower man∣dible are received into the upper, whose edges are scalloped near
the point; the tongue is di∣vided at the tip into slender threads; and
lastly, the hind claw is the longest of all. The bird weighs five or six
gros; the intestinal tube is seven inches and a half long; vestiges of a

<P>THIS is seen sometimes perched, sometimes running on the
ground, and particularly in newly ploughed fields, where it finds seeds,
small worms, and other insects; and accordingly it almost always has
earth sticking to its bill. It is easily ensnared, and when caught with
bird∣lime, it oftenest remains attached, or if it en∣tangles itself, it
loses most of its feathers in the struggle, and is no longer able to fly.
It soon becomes reconciled to captivity, but is not ab∣solutely
insensible of its situation; for, during the first two or three months,
it has only its usual chirp, which it repeats with frequency and trepidation
when a person goes near its cage: however, by gentle treatment, it at length
re∣sumes its warble. Its size and its habits are nearly the same with
those of the Yellow Bunt∣ing, and probably, if we were better acquainted with
these birds, we should perceive that they belonged to the same
species.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="312"/> The Cirl Buntings are not found in the
northern countries, and seem to be most frequent in those of the south;
however, they are rare in several provinces of France. They are often seen
with the Chaffinches, whose song they imi∣tate, and with whom they form
numerous flocks, especially in rainy days. They feed on the same
substances as the other granivorous tribe, and live about six years
according to Olina: but this must be understood of them in the domestic
state; for it is uncertain what effects fresh air and freedom of motion may
have upon longevity.</P>
<P>In the male, the upper-part of the head is spotted with
blackish upon an olive-green ground; there is a yellow spot on the sides,
di∣vided into two unequal parts, by a black streak which passes over the
eyes; the throat is brown and also the top of the breast, and a yellow
collar lies between them; the rest of the under-part of the body is yellow,
which grows more dilute as it spreads to the tail, and is spotted with
brown on the flanks; the upper-part of the neck and back is variegated with
rufous and blackish; the rump olive-rufous, and the supe∣rior coverts are
of a purer rufous; the quills of the wings brown, edged with olive, except the
near∣est to the back, which are rufous, and the two middle ones, which are
rusty-gray; lastly, the bill is cinercous, and the legs brown.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="313"/> In the female, there is less of the

only in a higher degree. The name of <HI>Meadow Bunting</HI> is improper; for
the most observant bird-catchers and fowlers have unanimously assured
me, that they never saw it in the meadows.</P>
<P>Like the Cirl Bunting, the Foolish Bunting is not found in the
northern countries, nor does its name occur in the catalogues of the Swedish
and Danish birds. It prefers solitude, and delights in mountainous abodes.
It is very common and well known in the hills round Nantua. Hebert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This excellent observer has communicated or confirmed the
principal facts of the history of the Buntings.</NOTE> often saw it on the
ground, and upon the chesnut-trees; and the country people told him, that its
flesh was excellent meat. Its song is very ordinary, and resembles that
of the Yellow Bunting; and the Prussian bird-catchers <PB N="283" REF="315"/> have remarked, that when it is put into a volery among others of a
different species, it discovers a strong predilection for the Yellow
Bunting. Indeed its cry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus says that in flying
it chirps <HI>zip, zip.</HI></NOTE>, its size, its figure, are the same,
and it differs only by some of its habits.</P>
<P>In the male, all the upper-part is variegated with blackish,
and gray; but this gray is purer on the head, and rusty every-where else,
except on some of the middle coverts of the wings, where it becomes almost
white. The same rusty gray edges almost all the quills of the wings and
of the tail, whose ground colour is brown, only the two exterior quills of
the tail are edged and tipt with white; the orbits are rusty white; the
sides of the head and of the neck are gray; the throat is gray, dotted with
blackish, and edged on each side and below by a line almost black, which
forms an irregular sort of square with the gray plate on the sides of the
head; all the un∣der-part of the body is fulvous, more or less di∣lute, but
dotted or variegated with blackish on the throat, the breast, and the
flanks; the bill and legs are gray.</P>
<P>Total length six inches and one fourth; the bill five or six
lines; the alar extent nine or ten inches; the tail two inches and one third, a
little forked, consisting of twelve quills, and exceeding the wings by
sixteen lines.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Foolish

<P>THIS is a bird of passage, and arrives early in the
spring. It deserves to be called <HI>Meadow Bunting,</HI> since in the
summer season it never strays far from the low grounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Belon says that it follows the water like the
Woodcock.</NOTE>. It makes its nest among the fields of barley, of oats, of
millet, &amp;c. seldom on the surface of the ground, but three or four
inches above, among the thick strong herbage<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Belon.</BIBL></NOTE>. The female lays four, five, and
sometimes six eggs; and while she is engaged in hatching, the male brings
her food, and sitting on the summit of a tree, he re∣peats incessantly
the disagreeable cry, <HI>tri, tri, tri, tiritz,</HI> which he retains only
till the month of August: the notes are sharper and shorter than those
of the Yellow Bunting.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that when the Bunting rose from the
ground towards a branch, its legs dropped, and its wings quivered with an
irre∣gular <PB REF="317"/> 
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE BUNTING.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="285" REF="318"/> motion peculiar to the
season of love. At other times, in autumn for instance, it flies equably
and swiftly, and mounts to a consider∣able height.</P>
<P>The young ones leave the nest long before they are able to
fly, and take delight to run among the grass; and this would seem to be the
reason why the parents build so close to the ground. The pointer-dogs
often surprise them in the chace of quails. The parents still continue to
feed and guard them till they are fledged; but their anxiety for the safety
of their brood often betrays them, and if a person chances to go near the
spot, they circle his head with a doleful air.</P>
<P>After the family is raised, they pour their nu∣merous flocks
into the fields, especially among the crops of oats, beans, and the late
sorts of grain. They migrate soon after the Swallows, and it very seldom
happens that any of them remain during the winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gesner.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is observed that the Bunting does not flut∣ter from branch
to branch, but alights on the extremity of the highest and most detached
bough either of a tree or shrub, and in a mo∣ment begins its song, which it
prolongs for whole hours in the same place, repeating its tiresome note,
<HI>tri, tri;</HI> and lastly, that in tak∣ing flight, it chatters with its
bill<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Most of these facts were communicated
by M. Hebert.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="319"/> The female sings also, after the
young no longer occupy her attention; but this is only when perched on a
branch, and about mid-day. Her song is as bad as that of the male. She is
rather smaller, but her plumage is nearly the same. Both feed upon grain
and small insects, which they find in the fields and meadows.</P>
<P>These birds are spread over all Europe, or rather they
visit the whole extent of it in their migrations. Olina affirms that they are
more numerous at Rome and in its vicinity than in other countries.
Bird-catchers keep them in a cage to use as calls in autumn; and they not
only entice the Foolish Buntings into the snare, but many other small
birds of different kinds. They are for this purpose put in low cages without
any bars or roosts.</P>
<P>In the male, the upper-part of the head and body is variegated
with brown and rufous; the throat, and the orbits, light rufous; the breast,
and all the rest of the under-part of the body, yellowish-white, spotted
with brown on the breast and sides; the superior coverts of the wings,
their quills, and those of the tail, are brown, edged with rufous, more or
less dilute; the bill and legs brown gray.</P>
<P>In the female, the rump is gray, verging upon rufous, without
any spots; the superior coverts of the tail the same colour, edged with
whitish; and in general the quills of the tail, and of the wings, are
bordered with lighter colours.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="320"/> The bill of these birds is of a
remarkable shape; the two mandibles are moveable, as in the Ortolans; the
edges are also re-entering, as in the Common Bunting, and the junction is
made in a crooked line; the edge of the lower man∣dible on each side, near
the third of its length, makes an obtuse salient angle, and is received by
the corresponding <HI>re-entrant</HI> angle in the upper-mandible, which is
more solid and bulky than in most other birds; the tongue is narrow, thick,
and tapered to a point, like a tooth-pick; the nostrils are covered above by
a membrane of a crescent shape, and below by small feathers; the first

<P>NATURE has been liberal to this bird, for she has bestowed
upon it a beautiful plu∣mage and a fine voice. The colours are perfect after
the first moulting, but the song needs to be assisted and formed by
art. In the state of freedom, the Bulfinch has three cries, which are all
unpleasant: the first, which is the most common, is a sort of whoop; it
begins with one, then two in succession, and afterwards three and four,
&amp;c. and, when animated, it seems to articulate with force the repeated
syllable <HI>tui, tui, tui;</HI> the second is an air of greater extent,

carters, and which whistled like them, with the same strength and
coarseness.</NOTE>. It also learns easily to articulate words 
<PB N="300" REF="334"/> and phrases, and utters them with so tender an
accent, that we might almost suppose it felt their force.—The
Bulfinch is besides susceptible of personal attachment, which is often
strong and durable. Some have been known, after escaping from the volery
and living a whole year in the woods, to recognize the voice of the
mistress, and return, to forsake her no more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One
of these birds which returned to its mistress, after living a year in the
woods, had all its feathers ruffled and tangled. Liberty has its
inconveniences, especially for an animal depraved by domestication.</NOTE>.
Others have died of melancholy, on being removed from the first object of
their attachment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aedonologie, p.
128.</BIBL></NOTE>. These birds well remember injuries received: a Bulfinch,
which had been thrown to the ground in its cage by some of the rabble, though
it did not appear much af∣fected at the time, fell into convulsions ever
after at the sight of any mean looking fellow, and expired in one of these
fits eight months from the date of its first accident.</P>
<P>The Bulfinches spend the summer in the woods or on the
mountains: they make their nest in the bushes, five or six feet from the
ground, and sometimes lower: this consists of moss, lined with soft
materials; and its opening is said to be the least exposed to the
prevailing wind. The female lays from four to six eggs <PB N="301" REF="335"/>
of a dirty white and a little bluish, encircled near the large end with a
zone, formed by spots of two colours, some of an ill-defined violet, others
of a distinct black. She disgorges the food for the young like the
Goldfinches, the Linnets, &amp;c. The male is attentive to his mate, and
Linnaeus relates that he sometimes holds out to her a spider in his bill a
very long time. The young ones begin not to whistle till they are able to eat
without assistance; and then they seem instinctively benevolent, if
what is related be true, that in a hatch of four, the three elder will feed
their puny brother. After the breeding is over, the parents still continue
associated through the winter, for they are al∣ways seen in pairs:
those which remain in the country, leave the forests, and descend from
the mountains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are many Bulfinches in the
mountains of Bologna, of Modena, of Savoy, of Dauphiné, of Provence,
&amp;c. OLINA.</NOTE> when the snow falls, and for∣sake the vineyard which
they haunt in the au∣tumn, and approach our dwellings, or lodge among the
hedges by the road-sides: those which migrate, depart with the Woodcocks,
about All Saints day, and return in the month of April<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Many are seen about the end of autumn and the beginning of
winter in the mountainous parts of Silesia, but not every year, according to
Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. They feed in summer upon all sorts of seeds,
insects, and sorbs<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaeus.</BIBL></NOTE>; and in the winter, upon 
<PB N="302" REF="336"/> juniper-berries, upon the buds of aspen, of alder, of
oak, of fruit-trees, of the marsh-willow, &amp;c. whence the name
<HI>Ebourgeonneux</HI> (from <HI>Bourgeon),</HI> which they sometimes have in
France: in that forbidding season, they are heard to whistle; and their
song, though somewhat sad, cheers the torpid gloom of nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the cage they eat hemp-seed, biscuit, prunes, sallad,
&amp;c. Olina recommends for the young ones the Nightingale's paste made with
walnuts, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some reckon these birds attentive and thought∣ful; and their
heavy air and the facility with which they are instructed seem to favour
that idea; but, on the other hand, their allowing one to get near them, and
their being decoyed into the different snares<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner caught many of them during the winter, by a bait of
night-shade berries.</NOTE>, indicate want of cir∣cumspection. As their
skin is very tender, those which are caught with bird-lime lose, in
strug∣gling to escape, part of their down, and even of their quills,
unless a person speedily disentan∣gles them. It deserves to be
remarked, that those which have the finest plumage are the least capable
of instruction, being older and not so tractable: but even the old ones are
soon recon∣ciled to the cage, provided that at first they have plenty of
food; they can also be properly tamed, as I have already noticed, though to
succeed re∣quires time and patient attention, which is the reason that
persons sometimes fail in the attempt. It seldom happens that one is
caught alone; the <PB N="303" REF="337"/> other is soon enticed to follow its
compa∣nion, and sacrisices its freedom to the calls of friendship.</P>
<P>It has been afferted that the Canary, which breeds with so
many other species, will never submit to the embrace of the Bulfinch, and
it is alleged as the reason, that the cock Bul∣finch, when in heat, holds his
bill open, which frightens the Canary. But the Marquis de Piolenc assures
me, that he saw a Bulfinch pair with a hen Canary, which had five young ones
about the beginning of April: their bill was larger than that of Canaries of
the same age, and they began to be covered with a blackish down, which
seemed to shew that they had more of the father than the mother:
unfortu∣nately they all died in performing a short jour∣ney. What adds more
weight to this observa∣tion, Frisch gives directions for the experiment: he
advises that the cock Bulfinch be the smallest of its kind, and be kept
long in the same volery with the hen Canary: he subjoins, that some∣times
a whole year elapses before the female will allow the Bulfinch to come near,
or to eat out of the same tray; which shews that the union is difficult but
not impossible.</P>
<P>It has been observed that the Bulfinches jerk their tail
briskly upwards and downwards, though not in so remarkable a degree as the
Wagtails. They live five or six years; their flesh is palat∣able according
to some, and not fit to be caten <PB N="304" REF="338"/> according to others,
by reason of its bitterness; this must depend upon the age, season,
and food. They are of the size of the House-Sparrow, and weigh about one
ounce. The upper-part of the head, the ring round the bill, and the origin of
the neck, are fine glossy black, which extends more or less forwards and
backwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence the name of Monk, or Pope, which this
bird has in many languages, and that of <HI>Coally-hood,</HI> given to it by
the people in Scotland. T.</NOTE>; the fore-part of the neck, the breast, and
the top of the belly, beautiful red; the abdomen, and the inferior coverts of
the tail and wings, white; the upper-part of the neck, the back, and the
shoulders, cinereous; the rump white, the superior coverts and the quills
of the tail, fine black, verging to violet, a whitish spot on the
outermost quills; the quills of the wings blackish cinereous, and deeper
the nearer to the body: the last of all red on the outside; the great
coverts of the wings of a fine changing black, terminated with reddish
light-gray; the middle ones cinereous; the small ones, blackish
ash-colour, edged with reddish; the iris hazel; the bill blackish, and
the legs brown.</P>
<P>The sides of the head and the fore-part of the neck, the
breast, the top of the belly, and in a word, almost all that was red in the
male, is vinous ash-colour in the female, and some∣times even the abdomen:
nor has it the fine glossy changing black that occurs on the head 
<PB N="305" REF="339"/> and other parts of the male. I have seen a fe∣male
however, which had the last of the wing-quills edged with red, and which had
no white on the outermost of those of the tail. Linnaeus adds, that the tip
of the tongue is divided into small filaments; but I have always found it
quite entire in the male, and shaped like a very short tooth-pick.</P>
<P>In many young Bulfinches which I have observed about the end
of June, the fore-head was light rufous, the fore-part of the neck and breast
rusty-brown; the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail fulvous, which
extends and grows more dilute on the side; the under-part of the body, more
or less dusky; the white ray over the wing deeply tinged with rusty; the
rump white of different shades.—But it is ob∣vious that considerable
diversities will occur.</P>
<P>Total length six inches; the bill five lines, thick and
forked; Kramer remarks, that the two mandibles are moveable, as in the Finches
and Buntings; the alar extent nine inches and one-fourth; the tail two inches
and one-third, somewhat forked, (but not always in the females,)
consisting of twelve quills; the outer-toe joined by its first
<HI>phalanx</HI> to the mid-toe; the hind-nail stronger and more hooked than
the rest.</P>
<P>The dimensions of the female when dissected were as
follows:—intestinal tube eighteen inches; vestiges of a
<HI>coecum;</HI> the <HI>oesophagus</HI> two inches <PB N="306" REF="340"/>
and a half, dilated like a bag, with a projecting edge next the gizzard, which
is muscular, con∣taining many small pebbles, and even two or three small
yellow seeds quite entire, though the birds had remained two days and a half
in the cage without eating; the cluster of the <HI>ovarium</HI> of an
ordinary size, and the small eggs nearly equal; the ovi-duct spread, and
above three inches in length; the <HI>trachea</HI> formed a sort of knot of a
considerable thickness, where it forked.</P>

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the BULFINCH.</HEAD>
<P>Sir Robert Sibbald has only a single line on the Bulfinch, and
says, that there are several kinds of it in Scotland: these are probably
only the varieties which we shall now describe.</P>
<P>Frisch tells that the Bulfinches may be di∣vided into three
different sizes: the Marquis de Piolenc was acquainted with two
distinguished by their bulk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The smallest, adds
M. de Piolenc, is of the size of the Chaf∣finch, its body is longer, its
breast of a brighter red; and it seems wilder than the ordinary
Bulfinch.</NOTE>: and others pretend that those of Nivernois are smaller
than those of Picardy. Lottinger assures us, that the Bulfinch of the
mountains exceeds that of the plain; and this <PB N="307" REF="341"/> accounts
for the diversity of bulk, being vari∣ously modified by local situation.
But these are too numerous to be separately treated: and I shall here
take notice only of the varieties of plumage.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>I. The WHITE BULFINCH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Loxia-Pyrrhula,</HI> var. 2. Linn.</NOTE>. Schwenck∣feld
speaks of a White Bulfinch that was caught near the village of Frischbach
in Silesia, and which had only some black feathers on the back. This fact
is confirmed by Delisle: 
<Q REND="inline">"There are in this canton, (of Beresow in
Siberia,) says that excellent astronomer, White Bulfinches, whose back is
somewhat blackish, and gray in summer: these birds have a delicate
pleasant song, much superior to that of European Bulfinches."</Q> It is
probable that the northern climate has much contributed to this change of
plumage.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>II. The BLACK BULFINCH<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Loxin-Pyrrhula,</HI> var. 1. Linn.</NOTE>. Under this
denomination, I include not only those which are entirely or almost black,
but also those which have perceptibly begun to assume that
com∣plexion:—such was what I saw at Baron Goula's; its throat and
rump were black; the inferior coverts of its tail, its lower belly, and the top
of its breast, variegated with rufous wine-colour and black, and no white
spots ap∣peared <PB N="308" REF="342"/> upon the last quill of the tail.
Those mentioned by Anderson and Salerne were en∣tirely of a jet black; that
of Reaumur noticed by Brisson, was black over the whole body. I have
observed one which assumed a fine glossy black after the first
moulting, but which still re∣tained a little red on each side of the neck,
and a little gray behind the neck, and on the small superior coverts of the
wings; its legs were flesh-coloured, and the inside of its bill red: that
of Albin had some red feathers under the belly; the five first quills of
the wing edged with white; the iris white, and the legs flesh-coloured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. White, in his Natural History of Selburne, relates also an
instance of a cock Bulfinch turning dingy, and afterwards black.</NOTE>.
Albin remarks that this bird was ex∣ceedingly gentle, like all the Bulfinches.
It often happens that this robe of black disappears in moulting, and gives
place to the natural colours: but often it renews each time, and re∣mains for
several years:—such was the case with Reaumur's. This would imply
that the change of colour is not the effect of disease.</P>

burning climate of Africa communicates a black hue to the plumage, as the cold
of Siberia introduces a snowy white. It is entirely black except a very
small white spot on the great coverts of the wing; and also the bill is
gray, and the legs ash-coloured. It was brought alive to Paris from the
coasts of Africa.</P>

<P>This bird seems to form the shade between the European
Bulfinches and the Round-bills of America. It is not larger than the Twite: a
fine black, changing into green, is spread over the head, the throat, and all
the upper-part of the body, including the coverts and quills of the tail and of
the wings, or more properly speak∣ing on what appears of these; for the
inside is either not black, or is black of a different kind: there is also
a very small white spot on each wing, and three spots of the same
colour, but larger, the one on the top of the head, and the 
<PB N="313" REF="347"/> two other below the eyes. All the under-part of the body
is white; the feathers of the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail are
frizzled in some subjects, for we may reckon the Frizzled Bulfinch of
Brazil as belonging to this species, since the sole difference
consists in the contexture of the plumage, which is superficial and
fluc∣tuating. It is probable that Frizzled Bulfinches are cock-birds, Nature
seeming in general to distinguish the males by strength and beauty. But
how, it would be asked, is the male found in Brazil, and the female in
Africa? I answer, 1. That the native climate of birds that pass through
different hands is very uncertain. 2. If these were brought alive to Paris,
they might also have been carried from South America to Africa. Any person
who will draw the comparison between these two birds, will readily admit
one of the two suppositions, rather than refer them to two different
species.</P>

<P>Brisson mentions two American blue Bul∣finches, of which
he makes two separate species: but as they are both natives of the same
climate, are of the same size, of the same shape nearly, and, except
the wings, tail, and bill, are of the same blue colour; I shall consider
them as form∣ing one single species, and regard the differences as
resulting from the influence of climate.</P>
<P>In both of them the prevailing colour is deep blue. The one
from South America has a small black spot between the bill and the eye; the
quills of the tail, those of the wings, and the great coverts of these, are
edged with blue; the bill is blackish, and the legs gray.</P>
<P>That of North America has at the base of its bill a black
circular zone, which extending forms a junction between the eyes; the quills of
the tail and those of the wings, and their great coverts, brown, tinged with
green; their middle coverts red, forming a transverse bar of the same
colour; the bill brown, and the legs black. The plumage of the female is
uniform, and of a deep brown, intermixed with a little blue.</P>
<P>With respect to the habits and oeconomy of these birds, we
can make no comparison, since <PB N="316" REF="350"/> we are unacquainted
with those of the first. Catesby informs us in regard to the one from
Carolina, that it is very solitary and rare; that it continues paired with
its female, and never appears in flocks; that it never winters in Caro∣lina;
that its song is monotonous, and consists of a repetition of the same
note. In all these proper∣ties the analogy to our Bulfinch is marked.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Loxia Coerulea:—</HI>

</LIST></HEAD>
<P>IT appears to us that this bird should be ranged between the
genus of the Widow and of the Bulfinch. Like the former, it has two long
feathers in the middle of its tail; and the latter it resem∣bles by the form
of its bill, which would be ex∣actly that of the Bulfinch, were the lower
man∣dible convex as the upper. But the tail of the Coly differs from that of
the Widow, because it consists of tapered feathers, of which the two
last project only three or four inches beyond the rest; whereas the
Widow-bird, besides the true tail, which is a bundle of feathers of equal
lengths attached to the rump, has appendices that in the different species of
this genus con∣tains two, four, and even six or eight feathers, extending to
double or triple the length of the true tail. In the Widow-birds too the webs
of the projecting feathers are equal on both sides, and pretty long, and
taper imperceptibly from the origin to the extremity, except in the Domi∣nican
and Shaft-tailed kinds; the former hav∣ing its webs very short, and quickly
contracting towards the tips; the latter also very short, but which
uniformly lengthen and expand at the tips. In all the Colies, the feathers of
the tail, whether those which properly belong to it, or those which project
from it, have vanes that <PB N="322" REF="359"/> continually diminish from the
insertion to the termination. Thus the real affinity between the tail of the
Widow-birds, and that of the Colies, consists in its length; and this
analogy is the closest in the case of the Dominican Widow.</P>
<P>M. Mauduit has made two important obser∣vations on this
subject. The first is, that the long tails, the appendices, and other
ornaments of certain birds, are not peculiar additions, but only the greater
extension of the parts common to all the feathered tribes. Thus long tails
con∣sist in the augmented growth of the quills of the tail; and crests
are derived from the enlargement of the feathers on the head. The mustachoes
of the Paradise bird appear to be only the produc∣tion of the slender
narrow plumules, which in all birds cover the <HI>meatus auditorius
externus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> The external aperture of
the ear.</NOTE>. The exuberant growth of the axillary feathers give rise to
the long floating feathers which shoot from under the wings in the Common
Paradise, and of those which present the double wings in the King
Paradise. When these feathers lie flat, they stretch towards the tail;
but when they are displayed they make angles with the axis of the body. They
differ from all other feathers, as their webs are equal on both sides of the
shaft. They resemble oars, and may serve to direct the bird's motion. And
thus all the ornaments of plumage are derived from the mere exuberance or
production of parts usually less apparent.—<PB N="323" REF="360"/>The
second observation of M. Mauduit is, that these decorations are rare in
the cold and tempe∣rate climates in both hemispheres, but are pretty frequent
in the hot countries, especially in the old continent. Scarce any long-tailed
birds are found in Europe, except the Pheasant, the Cock, which also is
often crested, and has long floating feathers on the sides; the Magpie, and
the long∣tailed Titmouse; and we have hardly any crest∣ed birds but the
Eared Owls, the Lapwing, the Crested Lark, and the Crested Titmouse. Some
water-birds indeed, such as the Ducks and He∣rons, have frequently long
tails, or ornaments composed of plumes, tufts, and feathers floating on the
rump.—These are all the birds which the frigid and temperate zones
afford, decorated with luxuriance of plumage. But in the torrid regions,
especially those of the old continent, the greatest number of birds are
robed with such rich attire: we might instance the Colies, the Paradise
birds, the Kakatoes, the Widows, the Crowned Pigeons, the Hoopoes, the
Peacocks, which are all natives of the hot climates of Asia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Colies belong to the ancient continent, and are found in the
warm parts of Asia and Africa, but never in America or Europe.</P>

<P>THESE birds are small and handsome; the largest are not
equal in size to a Sparrow, and the others are inferior to that of the Wren.
The general characters are these: the bill is short, strait, and
compressed on the sides near the tip; the upper-mandible is convex above,
and slightly scallopped on the edges, rather longer than the
lower-mandible, which is plain and straight.</P>
<P>In all these birds, the tail is short and square∣cut, and
the toes have the same disposition as the Cock of the Rock, the Tody, and
the Calao, viz. the mid-toe is closely connected to the outer-toe by a
membrane, as far as the third joint, and the inner-toe as far as the first
joint only. But as much as in that circumstance they resemble the Cock of
the Rock, so much are they removed from the Cotingas: yet some authors have

nomenclators are more culpable for deno∣minating them <HI>Pipra,</HI> or for
classing them to∣gether with the Cock of the Rock<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Brisson.</BIBL></NOTE>, to which they bear no analogy,
except in this disposition of the toes and in the square shape of the
tail: for, besides the total disproportion in size, the Cock of the Rock
being as large, compared with the Manakins, as the common hen contrasted with
a Sparrow, there are many other obvious charac∣ters which distinguish them:
their bill is much shorter in proportion, they are generally not crested,
and in those which have a crest, it is not double, as in the Cock of the
Rock, but formed by single feathers, somewhat longer than the rest. We
ought therefore to remove from the Manakins, not only the Horn-bills, but the
Cock of the Rock, and reckon them an inde∣pendent genus.</P>
<P>The natural habits common to them all were not known, and the
observations which have been made are still insufficient to admit an
exact detail. We shall only relate the remarks com∣municated to us by Sonini
of Manoncour, who saw many of these birds in their native climates. They
inhabit the immense forests in the warm parts of America, and never emerge
from their recesses to visit the cleared grounds or the vici∣nity of the
plantations. They fly with con∣siderable swiftness, but always at a
small height, <PB N="329" REF="367"/> and to short distances; they never
perch on the summits of trees, but on the middle branches; they feed upon
small wild fruits, and also eat insects. They generally occur in small
bodies of eight or ten of the same species, and some∣times intermingled
with other flocks of the same genus, or even of a different genus, such as
the Cayenne Warblers, &amp;c. It is commonly in the morning that they are found
thus assembled, and then seem to be joyous, and warble their delicate
little notes; the freshness of the air seems to inspire the song, for
they are silent during the burning heat of the day, and disperse and
retire to the shade of the thickest parts of the forest. This habit is
observed indeed in many kind of birds, and even in those of the woods of
France, where they collect to sing in the morn∣ing and evening; but the
Manakins never assemble in the evening, and continue together only from
sun-rise to nine or ten o'clock in the forenoon, and remain separate
during the rest of the day and the succeeding night. In general, they
prefer a cool humid situation, though they never frequent marshes or the
margins of lakes.</P>
<P>The name of the <HI>Manakin</HI> was bestowed on these birds
by the Dutch settlers at Surinam. We know six distinct species, but we
can only give the first the appellation which it has in its native
region.</P>

<P>This species has been well described by Marc∣grave. It is
the largest of all the Manakins; its total length is four inches and a half,
and it is nearly of the bulk of a Sparrow; the upper-part of its head is
covered with fine red feathers, longer than the rest, and which the bird can
erect at pleasure, which gives it the appearance of being crested; the back
and the small superior coverts of the wings are of a beautiful blue, the
rest of the plumage is velvet black; the iris is of a fine sapphire colour;
the bill is black, and the legs are red.</P>
<P>The Abbe Aubry, Rector of St. Louis, has in his cabinet a bird
by the name of <HI>Tise-guacu of Cuba,</HI> which is perhaps a variety of the
pre∣sent, arising from the difference of age or sex; the only
distinction being, that the large feathers on the upper-part of the head are
of a diluter red, and even somewhat yellowish. The de∣signation given to
it would seem to imply that <PB N="331" REF="369"/> it is found in the
Island of Cuba, and perhaps in other parts of America; but it is very rare at
Cayenne, and is a bird of short flight, and therefore it could hardly pass
from the continent to Cuba.</P>
<P>The Green Manakin with a red crest is the young of this
species; several Manakins have been observed, whose plumage was
interspersed with blue feathers, but the green is obscure. These birds
must be frequent in the warm cli∣mates of America, for we often received them

has no other song or warble; it is pretty common in Guiana, especially in
the skirts of the forests; for, like the other Manakins, it shuns the
sa∣vannas <PB N="332" REF="370"/> and cleared grounds. The Nut-crackers live
in small flocks with the other Manakins, but intermingle not with them; they
remain for the most part on the ground, and rarely perch on the branches, and
then they uniformly prefer the low ones. They seem to live more upon
insects than fruits: they are often found among the lines of ants, which
sting their feet, and make them hop and utter their nut-crack∣ing cry, which
they repeat very often. They are very lively and frisky; they are seldom at
rest, though they only hop, and cannot fly far.</P>

<P>We presume that these three birds are only varieties of
the same species, for they are exactly of the same size, being only
three inches and eight lines in length; whereas all the preceding species,
which have been placed in the order of their magnitude, are four inches and a
half, and four inches and three-fourths, &amp;c. These three are likewise
of the same shape, and even their colours are similar, if we except
those of the head, which in the first are of a fine yellow, in the second
of a bright red, and in the third of a beautiful blue; there is no other
sensible dif∣ference in the plumage, which is all uniformly of a fine
glossy black: the feathers which cover the thighs are of a pale yellow,
with an oblong spot of bright red on the exterior surface. In 
<PB N="336" REF="376"/> the first indeed, the bill is whitish and the legs
black; in the second, the bill is black and the legs cinereous; and in the
third, the bill is brown-gray, and the legs reddish: but these slight
dif∣ferences do not appear sufficient to constitute three separate
species, and perhaps one of them is only the female of another. However,
Mau∣duit, to whom I communicated this article, assured me that he never
saw, in the White-headed Manakin, the red feathers that cover the knee in the
Golden-headed Manakin: if this dif∣ference were invariable, we might infer that
these formed two separate species of Manakins: but Sonini assured us,
that he has seen White-headed Manakins with red feathers on their knees, and
there is some reason to suspect that the specimens observed by
Mauduit were mu∣tilated.</P>
<P>These Manakins are found in the same situa∣tions, and
are pretty common in Guiana. It would even appear that the species is
spread through the several other warm countries, as Brazil and Mexico. We
have learnt nothing particular in regard to their instincts and oeco∣nomy. We
are certain only that, like the other Manakins, they constantly live in the
woods, and that they have the chirping common to the whole genus, except the

<HEAD>VARIETY.</HEAD>
<P>This differs from the preceding by the colours of its head,
which is glossy black like the rest of the plumage, except a kind of
white collar which rises on the neck, and tapers to a point on the breast.
It is exactly of the same size as the three preceding, being only three
inches eight lines in length. We know not from what country it is brought,
having seen it only in private cabinets, where it was mentioned by this name
without any other indication. Sonini never met with it in Guiana; however, it
is probably, like the three others, a native of the warm climates in
America.</P>

of a fine dead white; the crown of the head is of a beryl co∣lour; the rump of

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>Besides the six species and their varieties, which we have
now described, modern nomenclators apply the name of Manakin to four birds
men∣tioned by Seba, and which we shall here notice, only to shew the errors
into which such artificial classifications lead.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The first is thus described by Seba:— 
<Q><HI>Bird called Miacatototl by the Brazilians</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Pipra Torquata</HI> of Gmelin, the
<HI>Manacus Torquatus</HI> of Brisson, and the <HI>Collared Manakin</HI> of
Latham.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Its body is ornamented with blackish
fea∣thers, and its wings with feathers of turkey-blue; its head is
blood-coloured, and has a gol∣den-yellow collar round the neck and throat; the 
<PB N="339" REF="379"/> bill and legs are of a pale yellow."</Q> Brisson,
who had not seen the bird, adds the dimensions and other details, which are
furnished neither by Seba, nor by any other author. It is also strange
that Seba should bestow the appellation of <HI>Mia∣catototl</HI> upon this
bird, which he says was brought from Brazil; for that word is not in the
lan∣guage of that country, but is a Mexican word, and signifies <HI>the
Maize-bird.</HI> But that Seba was mistaken in this application is evinced by
the circumstance that Fernandez employs the same term in describing a
Mexican bird which is very different. His words are these:— 
<Q><HI>Of the Miacatototl,</HI> or <HI>Maize-bird.</HI></Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"It is pretty small; so called because
it usually sits upon the shoots of maize; the belly is palish, and the
rest of its body black, but with white feathers interspersed; its wings
and tail are ash-coloured below. It frequents cool places, and is good
eating."</Q> Seba has manifestly confounded therefore two different birds
under the same name. But the description of Fernandez is as imperfect as
that of Seba, whose figure is still worse; so that it is impossible
to decide the ar∣rangement.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The same is the case with another bird men∣tioned by Seba,
under the name of 
<Q><HI>Rubetra,</HI> or <HI>Crested American Bird</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Pipra Rubetra</HI> of Linnaeus and Gmelin, the
<HI>Mana∣cus Cristatus Rufus</HI> of Brisson, and the <HI>Yellow
Manakin</HI> of Latham.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="380"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"It is not one of the smallest singing
birds," says he; "it has a yellow crest, its bill too is yellow, except the
under-mandible, which is brown, the plumage round the neck, and on the body, is
of a yellow rufous; the tail, and the great quills of the wings, are of a
shining blue, while the small quills are pale-yellow."</Q> From this
description of Seba, Brisson has ven∣tured to range this bird among the
Manakins; but if he had inspected the figure, though it is a very bad one, he
would have perceived the tail to be very long, the bill thin, curved, and
elon∣gated; characters quite different from those of the Manakins. I should
therefore conclude, that this bird is still farther removed from the
Mana∣kins than the preceding.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>A third bird which our nomenclators have reckoned a Manakin,
is that mentioned by Seba under the name of 
<Q><HI>Picicitli,</HI> or <HI>The Least Crested Bird of
Brazil</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Pipra Cristata</HI> of
Linnaeus and Gmelin, the <HI>Mana∣cus Cristatus Ruber</HI> of Brisson,
and the <HI>Purple Manakin</HI> of Latham.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The body and wings are purple, which here and
there is deeper; the crest is a most beautiful yellow, and formed by a
small tuft of feathers; its bill is pointed, and its tail red. In short,
this little bird is very handsome, whatever view we take of it."</Q> From
this confused de∣scription, Brisson concludes the bird to be a Manakin,
and adds the dimensions and other <PB N="341" REF="381"/> circumstances
without citing his authorities; yet Seba tells us that its bill is pointed; and
his sigure is very imperfect. Besides, he is mistaken in asserting
that it is a Brazilian bird, for the name <HI>Picicitli</HI> is Mexican; and
Fernandez em∣ploys the same word to describe another bird which is
certainly Mexican.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Picicitli</HI> is likewise a native
of Tetz∣coqua; it is very small, and its body wholly cinereous, except its
head and neck, which are black, with white spots encircling the eyes (which
are large), the front extending on the breast. These birds appear after
rain. If they be raised in the house they soon die. They have no song.
They are excellent food; but the In∣dians are uncertain where they
breed."</Q></P>
<P>It is easy to see that there is no relation be∣tween this
bird and that of Seba, who has very injudiciously occasioned a confusion
of terms.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The same remark may be made with regard to the fourth bird
described by Seba, under the name of 
<Q><HI>Coquantototl,</HI> or <HI>Small Crested Bird, shaped
like a Sparrow</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Pipra Grisea</HI>
of Gmelin, the <HI>Manacus Cristatus Gris∣cus</HI> of Brisson, and the
<HI>Gray Manakin</HI> of Latham.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Its bill is yellow, short, curved, and bent
backwards. There is a yellow spot above the eyes; the stomach and belly are
of a pale bluish yellow; the wings are of the same colour, and 
<PB N="342" REF="382"/> mixed with some slender carnation feathers, but the
principal feathers are ash-gray; the rest of the body is gray; there is a
small crest behind the head."</Q> From this indication Brisson has
inferred that the bird is a Manakin; but the shape of the bill is alone
sufficient to evince the contrary; and besides, since it is shaped like
a Sparrow, its form must be different from that of the Manakins. It is
evident, therefore, that this bird, whose name also is Mexican, is widely
re∣moved from the genus of the Manakins.—We shall not venture at
present to assign the rank of the four birds, but wait till inquisitive
travellers may have thrown light upon the subject.</P>

</LIST></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this bird is of an uniform colour, it is one of the
most beautiful of South Ame∣rica; for this colour is very beautiful, and its
plu∣mage nicely tapered. It feeds upon fruits, per∣haps for want of seeds;
since it differs from the gallinaceous tribe by the shape of its toes only,
which are connected by a membrane, the first and second as far as the third
joint, and the second with the third no farther than the first joint. The
tail is very short and square, as are some coverts of the wings;
several of these fea∣thers have a sort of fringe on each side, and the
first great feather of each wing is scalloped from the tip to one third of
its length: but what cha∣racterizes it the best is, a beautiful crest on
the crown, longitudinal, and of a semicircular form. In the minute
descriptions which Brisson and Vosmaër have given, this crest is
imperfectly depicted; it is not single, but double, consisting 
<PB REF="387"/> 
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE ROCK MANAKIN.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="347" REF="388"/> of two inclined planes that meet
at the vertex. In other respects their descriptions are accurate, except
that they are applicable only to the male. The plumage of the male is of a fine
red; that of the female is entirely brown, only there are some shades of
rust-colour on the rump, the tail, and the feathers of the wings. The crest
of the female is also double, but no so thick, so tall, so round, or
so far protruded on the bill, as in the male. Both male and female are
generally thicker and larger than the Ring-pigeon; but the different
individuals probably vary in size; for Brisson represents this bird of
the bulk of a Roman-pigeon, and Vosmaër asserts that it is rather
smaller than the Common Pigeon. This difference might also be occasioned
by the man∣ner of stuffing the specimens; but in the natural state the
female, though somewhat smaller than the male, is undoubtedly much larger
than the Common Pigeon.</P>
<P>The male assumes not the fine red till he has attained
some age; the first year he is only brown like the female; but as he grows
up, his plumage becomes marked with points and spots of rufous, which
gradually deepen into red, though perhaps perfected before advanced age.</P>
<P>Though this bird must have attracted the notice of all who
ever saw it, no traveller has described its habits and oeconomy. Sonini de
Manoncour is the first who has observed it with attention. It lodges not
only in the deep clefts <PB N="348" REF="389"/> of the rocks, but even in the
large dark caverns which totally exclude the solar rays; a circum∣stance
that has induced many to believe it to be a nocturnal bird; whereas it flies
and sees dis∣tinctly in the day-time: however, it seems na∣turally to
prefer gloomy recesses, since it is most frequent in caves which cannot
be entered with∣out the light of torches. We may therefore pre∣sume, that
their eyes are constructed like those of cats, and adapted both for the day
and the night. The male and female are equally lively, and extremely wild. It
is impossible to shoot them, unless the person be concealed behind a
rock, where he must often wait several hours before an opportunity occurs;
for the instant they perceive him, they escape to a distance by a flight
which is rapid, though rather low and short. They feed upon small wild
fruits, and usually scrape the ground, clap their wings, and shake
themselves like the dunghill fowls; but they neither crow like the cock, nor
cluck like the hen. Their cry resembles the sound of the syllable
<HI>ké,</HI> pronounced with a shrill drawling tone. They construct
their nest rudely in the holes of rocks with small dry sticks; and
com∣monly lay two white spherical eggs, which are of the size of those of
pigeons.</P>
<P>The males emerge oftener from their caverns than the females,
which seldom appear, and pro∣bably do not quit their retreats except in the
night. They can easily be tamed, and M. de <PB N="349" REF="390"/> Manoncour
saw one at the Dutch-post on the river Maroni, which was allowed freely to
live and run about with the poultry.</P>
<P>They are found in great numbers on the mountain Luca, near
Oyapoc, and on the mountain Courouaye, near the river Aprouack; and these are
the only parts in this region of America whence we can expect to procure
these birds. They are much esteemed for the sake of their beautiful
plumage, and are very scarce and dear; because the savages and negroes,
whether from superstition or fear, will not venture into the dark caverns
where they lodge.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Pipra

<P>There is another species, or rather variety of the Cock of
the Rock, which is found in the provinces of Peru: its tail is much longer than
that of the preceding, and its feathers have not square ends; its wings are
not fringed; instead of an uniform red, both wings and tail are black, and
the rump cinereous; the crest also is differ∣ent, being lower and
consisting of detached fea∣thers: in other respects, this Peruvian bird
re∣sembles the Guiana Cock of the Rock so closely, <PB N="350" REF="391"/>
that we may regard it as a variety of the same species.</P>
<P>We might consider these birds as the repre∣sentatives of
our dunghill poultry in the New World; but I am told that, in the interior
parts of Guiana and Mexico, there are wild fowls which bear still more
analogy. These are in∣deed much smaller, being scarcely of the size of
a Common Pigeon; they are generally brown and rufous; but they have the same
shape, the same little fleshy comb on the head, and the same port as
our ordinary fowl; their tail is also similar in shape and position,
and the males have the crow of the Cock, though feebler. The savages who
inhabit the remote tracts are perfectly well acquainted with these birds, but
have never reduced them to the domestic state; nor is this in the least
surprising, for they have tamed none of the animals which might have proved
useful, especially the Hoccos or Curassos, the Marails and the Agamis,
among the birds; and the Tapirs, the Pecaris, and the Agamis, among the
quadrupeds. On the con∣trary, the ancient Mexicans, who were civilized,
domesticated some animals, and particularly these small brown fowls.
Gemelli Carreri relates, that they were called <HI>Chiacchialacca;</HI> and he
subjoins, that they were precisely like our common poultry, only rather
smaller, and their feathers brownish.</P>

<HEAD>The COTINGAS.</HEAD>
<P>FEW birds have such beautiful plumage as the Cotingas; all
those who have had an op∣portunity of seeing them, whether travellers or
naturalists, seem to have been charmed, and speak of them with rapture.
Nature has selected her choicest and her richest colours, and spread
them with elegance and profusion: the painting glows with all the tints of
blue, of violet, of red, of orange, of purple, of snow-white, and glossy
black; sometimes these tints melt into each other by the sweetest
gradations; at other times they are contrasted with wonderful taste: the
various reflexions heighten and enliven the whole. The merit is intrinsic; it
is expressive; it is inimitable.</P>
<P>All the species, or, if we chuse, all the branches of the
brilliant family of the Cotingas belong to the New Continent; and there is no
foundation for what some have alleged, that they are found in Senegal. They
appear to delight in warm countries; they seldom occur south of Brazil, or
roam north of Mexico: and consequently they would hardly traverse the
immense stretch of ocean that separates the continents in those
latitudes.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="393"/> All that we know of their habits is, that
they never perform distant journies, but have only periodical flittings,
which are confined within a narrow circle: they appear twice a-year in the
plantations; and though they arrive nearly at the same time, they are never
observed in flocks. They generally haunt the sides of creeks in swampy
ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Edwards, who was unacquainted with the
oeconomy of the Cotingas, conjectured, from the structure of their feet, that
they frequented marshes.</NOTE>, which has occasioned some to call them
water-fowls. They find among the aquatic plants abundance of insects, on
which they feed, and particularly what are termed <HI>karias</HI> in America,
and which, according to some, are wood-lice; and according to others, a
sort of ants. The creoles have, it is said, more motives than one for
hunting after these birds;—the beauty of the plumage, which pleases
the eye; and, according to some, the delicacy of the flesh, which flatters
the palate. But it is difficult to obtain both; for the plu∣mage is often
spoiled in attempting to skin the bird; and this is probably the reason
why so many imperfect specimens are now brought from America. It is said
that they alight among the rice-crops and do considerable injury: if this be
true, the creoles have still another reason for destroying them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The little which I have related of the habits of the
Cotingas was communicated by M. Aublet: but I must add, that M. de Manoncour
heard that the flesh of the Cotingas was much esteemed at Cayenne; perhaps
this is true only of some species.</NOTE>.</P>

their insertion, is black; but as the tips are beryl, this is really the
predominant colour of the plumage. In some parts of the upper surface of

small specks; and it is totally concealed by the blue in the

<P>Almost all the feathers in the body of this bird, and the
coverts of the wings and of the tail are unwebbed, and parted into filaments;
so that they resemble silky bristles more than real feathers: a
property which is sufficient to dis∣tinguish it from all the other
Cotingas. The general colour of its plumage is bright blue, varying into a fine
sky-blue, as in the preced∣ing; but we must except the throat, which is
deep violet, and the quills of the tail and of the wings, which are blackish;
most of these are edged exteriorly with blue; the feathers of the head and
of the upper-part of the neck are long and narrow, and the ground-colour is
brown; that of the feathers of the body and breast, &amp;c. consists of
two colours; at the in∣sertion of these feathers it is white, and then
purple-violet, which in some parts strikes through the blue of the

<P>All the plumage of this beautiful bird is bright
glossy-purple, except the quills of its wings, which are whitish tipt

the under-side of the tail is of a lighter purple; the ground of the feathers
on every part of the body is white; the legs are blackish; the bill
gray-brown, and on each side of its base rises a small whitish
streak, which, passing under the eyes, bounds the face.</P>
<P>The great coverts of the wings are oddly fashioned, long,
narrow, stiff, pointed, and spout∣shaped; their vanes parted, their
shaft white, and without webs at its tip, which resembles in some degree
the appendices that terminate the wing in the Common Chatterer
<HI>(Jaseur),</HI> and is nothing but the projection of the shaft beyond
the webs. This is not the only point of re∣semblance between these two
species; in the shape of their bill, their size, the proportional
dimensions of their tail, their feet, &amp;c.; but their instincts are very
different, since the com∣mon Chatterer prefers the mountains, and all the

<P>The prevailing colour of its plumage is red, but diversified
by various tints, which it assumes in different parts; the most vivid,
which is scarlet, is spread over the upper-part of the head, and forms a
sort of crown or cap, of which the fea∣thers are pretty long, and are
conjectured by Edwards to rise like a crest: the same scarlet covers
the lower-part of the belly, the thighs, the lower-part of the back, and
almost to the end of the tail-quills, which are tipt with black; the sides
of the head, the neck, the back, and the wings are shaded with deep tints,
which change the red into a fine soft crimson; but the darkest cast is
a sort of border which surrounds the scarlet cap, and this is a little
more dilute be∣hind the neck and on the back, and more so on the throat and
breast; the coverts of the wings are edged with brown, and the great quills
become more and more obscure, and terminate almost in black; the bill is a

covered with a sort of down as far as the origin of the toes.</P>

<P>Laët is the only person who has mentioned this bird,
and all that he says amounts to no more than that its plumage is white and
its cry very loud. Since his time, the species has been in a manner lost,
even in Cayenne; and M. de Manoncour has the merit of re-discover∣ing it.</P>
<P>Both the male and the female are figured in the <HI>Planches
Enlumineés.</HI> They were perched upon trees beside a swamp when
they were killed; they were betrayed by their cry, which, <PB N="363" REF="405"/> as Läet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyagers say, that its voice
resembles the sound of a bell, and may be heard at the distance of
half-a-league. 
<BIBL><HI>Hist. Gen. des Voyages,</HI> tom. xiv. p.
299.</BIBL></NOTE> observed, was very loud; and it re∣sembled the sound
of the two syllables <HI>in an,</HI> uttered with an exceedingly drawling
tone.</P>
<P>The most remarkable character of these birds is, a sort
of caruncle under the bill as in the turkies, but differently organized: it is
flaccid and pendulous when the bird is composed at rest; but when the
passions are rouzed, it swells in every dimension, and, in this state
of tension, is more than two inches long, and three or four lines in
circumference at the base: this effect is produced by air, which is driven
through an aperture of the palate into the cavity of the caruncle and inflates
it.</P>
<P>This caruncle differs from that of the turkey also in
another circumstance; it is covered with small white feathers; and
besides, it is not peculiar to the male. The plumage of the female is however
entirely different: for in the male the bill and legs are black, all the rest
of a pure spotless white, except some tints of yellow on the rump, and on
some of the quills of the tail and of the wings: but in the female the colour
is not so uniform; the upper-part of the head and body, the superior
coverts of the wings, and most of the quills of the wings and of the tail,
are olive mixed with gray; the la∣teral <PB N="364" REF="406"/> quills of the
tail gray, edged with yellow; the cheeks and forehead white; the feathers of
the throat gray, edged with olive; those of the breast and of the anterior
part of the belly gray, edged with olive and tipt with yellow, and the coverts
of the lower surface of the tail lemon-yellow; the inferior coverts of the
wings white, edged with the same yellow.</P>
<P>The male and female are nearly of the same size. Total
length twelve inches; length of the bill eighteen lines; its breadth at its
base seven lines: length of the tail three inches nine lines,
consisting of twelve equal quills, and pro∣jecting twenty-one lines beyond
the wings.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Ampelis

<P>The head is deep brown; the quills of the wings blackish;
their small coverts black; the great coverts blackish, with some mixture
of brownish green: all the rest of the plumage is cinereous, mixed with
blackish, chiefly on the back, and with greenish on the rump and tail. 
<PB N="365" REF="407"/> The bill is broad at the base, as in the Cotingas; its
tongue is short; its nostrils uncovered; its iris bluish-black; its bill
black; its legs blackish. It has several black fleshy appendices under
the neck, nearly of a lance-shape, which marks a slight affinity to the
preceding at the same time that it discriminates it from all the other
Cotingas.</P>
<P>The Variegated Cotinga is as large as a Pi∣geon; the length of
its bill, which is an inch, equals the greatest breadth; its legs are twelve
or thirteen lines; its tail is three inches, and is almost wholly beyond the
reach of the wings.</P>
<P>The female is rather smaller than the male, and has not the
fleshy appendices under the neck; it resembles the Fieldfare in shape and
size; its plumage is a mixture of blackish, of brown, and light green; but
these colours are distributed so, that the brown predominates on the
back, and the light-green on the throat, the breast, and the under-part of
the body.</P>
<P>These birds grow plump and juicy. The male has a very
strong voice, and inflected in two different ways; sometimes it resembles
the noise occasioned by striking a cutting instrument against a wedge
of iron <HI>(kock, kick);</HI> and some∣times it is like the jarring of a
bell that is crack∣ed <HI>(kur, kur, kur).</HI> It is heard in no part of the

southern hemisphere, in December and January; and hence the Portu∣guese

very wide, which perhaps contributes to the strength of its voice.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Ampelis Variegata:—</HI>

<P>IF the beauty of plumage formed the charac∣teristic feature of
the Cotingas, this bird, and that of the preceding article, would be regarded
as degenerate branches of the original stock. The <HI>Guirarou</HI> has
nothing remarkable either in its colours, or in their distribution, if we
except a black bar below the eyes, and the tint of the iris, which is
sapphire: a uniform light gray is spread over the head, the neck, the
breast, and all the under-part of the body; the thighs, and the upper-part of
the body, cinereous; the quills, and coverts of the wings, blackish; the
quills of the tail black, tipt with white, and its superior coverts white;
lastly, the bill and legs are black.</P>
<P>The flat shape, and the shortness of the bill, the
loudness of its voice, which is somewhat like that of the Blackbird, but
shriller, and its haunt∣ing the margin of water, are the chief
circum∣stances in which the <HI>Guirarou</HI> resembles the Cotingas; its
size is also nearly the same, and it inhabits the same climates: yet
Willughby has referred it to the White-ears; and other excel∣lent
ornithologists have reckoned it a Fly-catcher. <PB N="368" REF="410"/> For my
own part, I shall not venture to assign its genus; I shall retain the
name which it bears in its native climate, and wait for fuller observa∣tions
made on several living subjects, which will point out its proper
arrangement. The <HI>Guira∣rous</HI> are very common in the interior parts of
Guiana, but are not found at all in Cayenne; they ramble little; many occur
generally in the same district; they perch generally on the lowest
branches of certain large trees, where they pick up seeds and insects, on
which they subsist. From time to time, they cry all at once, allowing an
interval between each sound; this cry, though harsh in itself, is
cheering music to travellers who have lost their way in the immense
forests of Guiana, for it directs them to the banks of a river.</P>
<P>The subject observed by M. De Manoncour was nine inches and

<P>IN the low, swampy, thin-settled lands of South America, the
swarms of insects and loathsome reptiles seem to predominate over all
the rest of the animal creation. In Guiana and Brazil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is also the case in many other parts of America. Piso
relates, that in Brazil, and even in the wet grounds of Peru, the quantity of
ants is so enormous, that they devour all the seeds which are committed to
the earth; and though fire and water be employed to extirpate them, the
attempts have hitherto failed of success. He adds, that it were much to be
wished that Nature had ordained in those countries many species of
animals like the Ant-eaters <HI>(Myr∣mecophagae,</HI> Linn.), which might bore
into the hillocks, and extract these insects with their long tongue. Some
of the ants are not larger than those of Europe; others are twice or thrice
as large. They raise hills as large as hay-stacks; and their number is so
vast, that they make tracks several feet broad in the fields, and in the
woods, and often through an extent of many leagues.—Fernandez says
also that these ants are larger, and pretty much like our winged-ants, and
that their hills are of an incredible height and width.</NOTE> the ants are
so astonishingly multiplied, that their hills are some fathoms wide,
and seve∣ral feet in height, and proportionally populous as those of
Europe, of which the largest are only two or three feet in diameter; so
that they may be computed to contain two or three hundred times the number of
ants. Yet they exceed still more in number; and in the wildernesses of
Guiana they are an hundred times more fre∣quent than in any part of the ancient
continent. <PB N="371" REF="413"/> But (such is the system of Nature!)
every crea∣ture is the destined prey of another; and gene∣ration and
destruction are ever conjoined. We have in the former work given an account
of the <HI>Tamanoir,</HI> of the <HI>Tamandua,</HI> and of the other quadrupeds
which feed upon ants; we are now to write the history of a kind of birds
which live also upon these insects.—We were unacquainted with the
existence of the Anters till M. de Ma∣noncour presented the specimens to
the King's cabinet.</P>
<P>The Anters are natives of Guiana, and are analogous to none of
the European birds; but in the shape of their body, of their bill, of their
feet, and of their tails, they bear a great resem∣blance to the
short-tailed Thrushes <HI>(Breves),</HI> which our nomenclators have
improperly con∣founded with the Blackbirds: but as the short-tailed
Thrushes inhabit the Philippines, the Mo∣luccas, the island of Ceylon,
Bengal, and Mada∣gascar, it is more than probable that they are not of the
same race with the Anters of Ame∣rica. These appear indeed to constitute
a new genus, for which we are wholly indebted to M. de Manoncour, whom I have
so often cited for his extensive knowledge of foreign birds: he has
presented above an hundred and sixty different species to the Royal
cabinet; and has also been so obliging as to communicate to me all the
observations which he made in his voy∣ages to Senegal and America. I have on
many <PB N="372" REF="414"/> occasions availed myself of this information;
and in particular I have formed entirely from it the history of the
Anters.</P>
<P>In French Guiana, and indeed in all countries where natural
history is little known, names are applied to animals from the slightest
analogies. This has been the case with the Anters: they were observed to
perch seldom, and run like Partridges; but as they were inferior to these
birds in size, they were distinguished at Ca∣yenne by the appellation of
<HI>Little Partridges.</HI></P>
<P>But these birds are neither Partridges, nor Blackbirds, nor
short-tailed Thrushes; only they resemble the last in their chief
external charac∣ters. Their legs are long; their tail and wings short; the
nail of the hind-toe more hooked, and longer than those of the fore-toes; the
bill strait and lengthened; the upper-mandible scal∣loped at its extremity,
which bends at the junc∣tion of the lower mandible, and projects about a line
beyond it; but their tongue is short, and beset at the tip with small
cartilaginous and fleshy threads. Their colours are also very dif∣ferent;
and it is very probable that their in∣stincts are dissimilar, since
they inhabit widely distant climates. When we described the short-tailed
Thrushes, we were unable to give any account of their natural habits, since
no tra∣vellers had taken notice of them, and therefore we cannot draw any
comparison with those of the American Anters.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="415"/> In general the Anters keep in flocks, and
feed upon small insects, and chiefly ants, which are for the most part
similiar to those of Europe. They are almost always found upon the
ant-hills, which in the interior tracts of Guiana, are more than twenty feet in
diameter, and whose insect nations retard the extension of cultivation,
and even consume the provisions of life.</P>
<P>There are several species of Anters, which, though very
different in appearance, often asso∣ciate together; the large ones and the
small, the long-tailed and the short-tailed, are found on the same
spot. Indeed, if we except the principal kind, which are very few, it is rare
to find in the rest two subjects perfectly alike; and we may suppose
that this diversity arises from the intermixture of the small ones: so
that we must regard them as mere varieties, and not distinct species.</P>
<P>In all these birds the wings and tail are very short, and
therefore ill calculated for flying; accordingly they only trip along the
ground, and hop among the low branches; and though lively and active, they
never shoot through the air.</P>
<P>The voice of the Anters is various in the dif∣ferent species,
and in some it is very singular.</P>
<P>As insects are the chief food of these birds, they seek
the solitary tracts where those are not molested by the intrusion of
man, and swarm in abundance. They live in the thickest and the 
<PB N="374" REF="416"/> remotest forests, and never visit the savannas,
the cleared grounds, and still less the neighbour∣hood of plantations. They
employ dry herbs carelessly interwoven in the construction of their
nests, which are hemispherical, and two, three, or four inches in diameter,
and suspend them by the two sides on the bushes, two or three feet from
the ground. They lay three or four eggs, which are almost round.</P>
<P>The flesh of most of these birds is unpalatable food, and
has an oily rank taste, and when opened, the digested mass of ants, and
of other insects they swallow, exhales a putrid offensive smell.</P>

shaped from that of all the others. This bird is generally on the ground, and
is far from being so lively as the rest, who hop around it. It frequents
the same spots, and feeds also upon insects, especially ants. The

is so strong, that it can be heard at a great distance, and one would
hardly suppose it emitted by so small a bird. The succession of
sounds, which is as rapid as the quick strokes of a bell, continues about
an hour. It appears to be a sort of call similar to that of the
Par∣tridges, only it is heard at all seasons, and every day, at the
rising of the sun, and before his setting: however, as the period of love
is not fixed in those hot climates, the Partridges, as well as the Anters,
have their call in every sea∣son indiscriminately.</P>

</LIST></HEAD>
<P>This was called by M. de Manoncour, the <HI>Musician of
Cayenne;</HI> I rather chuse to retain the name of <HI>Arada,</HI> which it
receives in its native country.</P>
<P>It is not exactly an Anter; but we have placed it after
these, because it has the same external characters, though it differs in
its ha∣bits. It perches upon trees, and never alights on the ground, except to
pick up ants and other insects, upon which it feeds. It is distinguished
from them by a remarkable property; for all the Anters utter harsh cries
without any molestation, while the Arada has the most charming warble. It
commences often with the seven notes of the octave, and then whistles
different soft varied airs, which are lower than those of the Night∣ingale,
and more like the breathing of a sweet toned flute; and it is said to excel
even that ce∣lebrated chorister of the grove in delicate tender 
<PB N="386" REF="429"/> melody. It has also a sort of whistle,
resembling that by which a person calls upon another: tra∣vellers
frequently mistake this sound, and, by following it, they are led more
astray; for as they approach, the bird continually recedes, and whistles at
intervals.</P>
<P>The Arada avoids settled spots; it lives alone in the
depth of the vast forests, and the softness of its melody seems in
some measure to relieve the gloomy stillness around. It is one of the
very few birds in the New World which Nature has distinguished by the
charms of its song. But the species is not numerous; and the traveller may
frequently pursue his pathless journey without meeting a single Arada to
sooth his sympathetic gloom.</P>
<P>The colours of its plumage correspond not with the
richness of its song; they are dull and obscure.—The total length
is four inches, and the tail is radiated transversely with rufous, brown,
and blackish;—it exceeds the wings by seven lines.</P>
<P>To the Arada we may refer a bird which Mauduit shewed to us:
it resembles that in the length and shape of its bill, the form of its
tail, the length of its legs, in having some white feathers mixed with the
brown ones on the sides of the neck; the size is nearly equal, and the
shape similar; but the tip of its bill is more hooked, its throat is white,
with a half-collar of black below, and its plumage is uniform, 
<PB N="387" REF="430"/> and not striped with brown lines, as in the Arada,
whose throat and under-part of its neck are red. We may presume therefore,
that this bird is either a distinct variety of the Arada, or a contiguous
species, since it inhabits Cayenne; though, being unacquainted with its
habits, we shall not at present presume to decide the matter.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Turdus Gantans:—</HI>

<P>TO avoid confusion, we shall restore to this bird the name

Dutertre, and have men∣tioned it by the appellation of <HI>Caracara;</HI> but
that term was bestowed by Marcgrave upon a bird of prey totally different
from the <HI>Agami.</HI></P>
<P>Naturalists have entertained the most opposite opinions
with regard to this bird. Dutertre supposes it to be a Pheasant; Barrere
reckons it a Wild Hen; Pallas terms it a Crane; and Adanson seems to
insinuate that it is a large aquatic bird of the genus of the Lapwing,
be∣cause its knees are prominent, and its hind-toe is placed a little higher
than the three fore-toes, and because it appears the intermediate kind
between the <HI>Jacana</HI> and the <HI>Kamichi.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="434"/> 
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE GOLD-BREASTED TRUMPETER.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="435"/> But the Agami is quite a distinct race.
It re∣sembles indeed the aquatic birds in the charac∣ter which Adanson has
properly remarked, and also the greenish colour of the legs; but its nature
is entirely different. It inhabits the arid mountains, and the upland
forests; and never visits the fens, or the margins of water.—We have
here another example of the errors into which artificial systems lead.</P>
<P>Nor is it a Pheasant or Curasso; for not only are its legs
and thighs different, but its toes and nails are much shorter. Still more is
it widely separated from the Common Hen; and it can∣not be ranged with the
Cranes, since its bill, its neck, and its neck, and its legs, are much
shorter than in the aquatic birds.</P>
<P>The Agami is twenty-two inches long; its bill, which is exactly
like that of the gallinaceous tribe, is twenty-one lines; its tail is very
short, not exceeding three inches and one-fourth, and is concealed by the
superior coverts, and does not project beyond the wings; its legs are five
inches high, and completely covered with small scales, as in the other
gallinaceous birds, and these scales reach two inches above the knees,
which are not feathered.</P>
<P>The whole of its head, its throat, and the upper half of its
neck, both above and below, are covered with a short down, which is very
close, and feels very soft; the fore-part of the lower surface of the
neck, and the breast, are covered <PB N="392" REF="436"/> with a beautiful
gorget four inches broad, whose brilliant colours vary between green, gold
green, blue, and violet; the upper-part of its back, and the contiguous portion
of its neck, are black; the plumage changes on the hind-part of the back into a
tawny-rufous; but all the under-side of the body is black, and also the
wings and the tail; only the great feathers which ex∣tend on the rump and the
tail, are light ash∣coloured; the legs are greenish.</P>
<P>The nomenclators<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barrère,
Brisson, Vosmaër, &amp; &amp;c.</NOTE> have also confounded the
Agami with the <HI>Macucagua</HI> of Marcgrave, which is the great

extension.</P>

and Vosmaër<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The most characteristic and remarkable property of
these birds consists in the wonderful noise which they often make,
either of themselves; or when urged by the keepers of the <HI>menagerie.</HI>
I do not wonder that hitherto they have been supposed to form this through
the anus. It cost me no little trouble to convince myself of the contrary.
To succeed, one must be on the ground, and with a bit of bread entice the
bird to come near; then make the noise, which the keepers can well imitate,
and often dispose the Agami to repeat it. This equivocal noise is
sometimes preceded by a savage cry, interrupted by a sound approaching
that of <HI>scherck, scherck,</HI> to which succeeds the hollow
singular noise in question, which re∣sembles somewhat the moan of
pigeons. In this way it utters five, six, or seven times, with
precipitation, a hollow noise emitted from within its body, nearly as if one
pronounced <HI>tou, tou, tou, tou, tou, tou,</HI> with the mouth shut,
resting upon the last <HI>teu . . .</HI> a very long time, and terminating
by sinking gradually with the same note. This sound also resembles
much the lengthened doleful noise which the Dutch bakers make, by blowing a
glass trumpet, to inform their customers when the bread comes out of the
oven. This sound, as I have already said, issues not from the anus; yet
I am very confident, that it is formed by a slight opening of the bill, and
by a sort of lungs peculiar to almost all birds, though of a dif∣ferent
form. This is also the opinion of M. Pallas, who heard it often with me, and
to whom I gave one of the dead birds for dis∣section." The doctor has
communicated to me his observations with respect to the internal
structure of the animal, for which I am much obliged to him. 
<Q REND="inline">"The wind-pipe," says he, "before its
entrance into the breast, is as thick as a large writing-pen, bony, and quite
cylindrical. In the breast it becomes cartilaginous, and divides into two
semi-circular canals, which pass through the lungs, the left one being very
short, but the right one reaching the bottom of the lower belly, and parted
by transverse membranes into three or four lobes."</Q></P> 
<P>These lungs therefore are undoubtedly the instrument of
the various cries emitted by birds. The air pressed by the impulsive
action of the fibres, seeks to escape through the large branches of the
fleshy lungs, and meets with an obstruction from the little elastic
membranes, which produces pulsations, the origin of all sorts of sounds 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoires de l'Academie des
Sciences, <HI>année</HI> 1753. p. 293.</NOTE>. But, what above all
convinces us that this noise proceeds not from the anus, if a person
observes attentively when the bird makes it, he will perceive the breast
and belly to heave, and the bill to open somewhat. 
<BIBL>VOSMAER, <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> 1768.</BIBL></P></NOTE>
have accurately ascer∣tained the singular power which this bird has of 
<PB N="393" REF="437"/> emitting a dull hollow sound, which was sup∣posed
to come from the anus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de la Condamine entertained
this opinion. 
<BIBL><HI>Voyage des Amaxons,</HI> p. 175.</BIBL></NOTE>, and
have disco∣vered <PB N="394" REF="438"/> that this is a mistaken notion. We
shall only observe that in many birds, as well as in the Agami, the
windpipe is bony at its opening, and becomes cartilaginous in its descent,
and in general the cries of such birds are deep; but there are also many
birds on the other hand whose windpipe is cartilaginous at its rise, and
termi∣nates bony in the breast, and these have com∣monly shrill
notes.</P>
<P>The odd sort of noise which this bird makes, is probably
owing to the extent of lungs, and the capacity of their membranous cells. But
it is unnecessary to suppose with Vosmaër, that the Agami is
obliged to open its bill a little in order to give passage to the sound;
for any sudden motion in the bowels is communicated through the muscles and
teguments to the external air, which conveys the impulse to the ear. We have
often occasion to notice this circumstance; and it appears to be prejudice
that the sounds pro∣duced by animals are always transmitted through the
throat, or through the alimentary canal. Nor is this species of
ventriloquism peculiar to the Agami; the Curasso without opening its bill
makes a similar hollow sound, which is even more articulate and more
powerful. Indeed the same property seems to obtain, though in a less
degree, in many kinds of birds in which the lungs are proportionally larger
than in the qua∣drupeds. The hoarse murmur which the Turkey-cock makes before
his gobble, the cooing which <PB N="395" REF="439"/> the Pigeon effects without
motion of the mouth, are of this nature; only in these the sound rises
near the bottom of the throat; but in the Cu∣rasso, and especially in the
Hocco, it has its ori∣gin deeper.</P>
<P>In regard to the manner in which the Agami lives in the
domestic state, I shall quote the words of Vosmaër:— 
<Q REND="inline">"When these birds are well kept, they are
attentive to cleanliness, and often peck the feathers of the body and wings
with their bill: if they frolic with each other, they per∣form all their
movements by hopping, and vio∣lently flapping their wings. The change of food
and of climate certainly cools here (in Holland) their natural ardor for
propagation. Their ordinary subsistence is grain, such as buck-wheat,
&amp;c. but they also eat readily small fish, flesh, and bread. This
fondness for fish, and the uncommon length of their legs, shew that they
partake of the nature of the Herons and Cranes, and that they belong to the
class of the aquatic birds."</Q> We must observe here that the
fond∣ness for fish is no proof, since poultry are as greedy of this
sort of food as of any other. 
<Q REND="inline">"What <HI>Pistorius</HI> relates," continues
Vosmaër, "with respect to the gratitude of this bird, may put many to
the blush. When tamed, it distin∣guishes its master and benefactor with
marks of its affection. Having reared one, I had an op∣portunity of
experiencing this myself: when I opened its cage in the morning, the kind
ani∣mal <PB N="396" REF="440"/> hopped round me, expanding both his wings, and
<HI>trumpeting</HI> (this is the term which we may employ to express the
noise) from his bill, and behind, as if he wished me good mor∣ning. He
shewed no less attention when I went out and returned again; no sooner
did he per∣ceive me from a distance than he ran to meet me: and even when I
happened to be in a boat, and set my foot on shore, he welcomed me with the
same compliments, which he reserved for me alone, and never bestowed them
upon others."</Q></P>
<P>We shall subjoin a number of additional facts, which were
communicated by M. de Manon∣cour.</P>
<P>In the state of nature the Agami inhabits the vast forests
in the warm climates of America, and never visits the cleared grounds,
still less the settled spots. It associates in numerous flocks, and
prefers not the swamps and sides of lakes; for it is often found on the
mountains, and in hilly situations. It walks and runs rather than flies,
since it never rises more than a few feet, and only to reach some short
distance, or to gain some low branch. It feeds upon wild fruits, like the
Curassos, the Marails, and other gallinaceous birds. When surprised in
its haunts, it makes its escape by swiftness of feet, seldom using
its wings, and at the same time emits a shrill cry like that of the
Turkey.</P>
<P>These birds scrape the earth at the roots of the large trees
to form a bed for their eggs; and <PB N="397" REF="441"/> employ no lining, and
construct no nest. They lay many eggs, from ten to sixteen; but the
number is proportioned, as in all other birds, to the age of the female; they
are almost spherical, larger than hens eggs, and tinged with light green.
The young Agamis retain their down, or rather their first dishevelled
feathers, much longer than our chickens, or infant-partridges: these are
sometimes near two inches long, and before a certain age they might pass
for animals covered with silky hairs, which are close like fur, and feel
soft; the true feathers appear not till they have attained the fourth of
their full growth.</P>
<P>The Agami is not only tamed easily, but be∣comes attached to
its benefactor with all the fondness and fidelity of dogs; and of this
dis∣position it shews the most unequivocal proofs. When bred up in the
house, it loads its master with caresses, and follows his motions; and
if it conceives a dislike to persons on account of their forbidding figure,
their offensive smell, or of in∣juries received, it will pursue them
sometimes to a considerable distance, biting their legs, and
tes∣tifying every mark of displeasure. It obeys the voice of its
master, and even answers to the call of all those to whom it bears no
grudge. It is fond of caresses, and offers its head and neck to be
stroked; and if once accustomed to these fa∣miliarities, it becomes
troublesome, and will not be satisfied without continual fondling. It makes
<PB N="398" REF="442"/> its appearance as often as its master sits down to
table, and begins with driving out the dogs and cats, and taking
possession of the room: for it is so obstinate and bold, that it
never yields, and often after a tough battle, can put a middle-sized dog to
flight. It avoids the bites of its anta∣gonist by rising in the air, and
retaliates with violent blows with its bill and nails, aimed chiefly at the
eyes; and after it gains the superiority, it pursues the victory with the
utmost rancour, and, if not parted, will destroy the fugitive. By its
intercourse with man, its instincts became moulded like those of dogs;
and we are as∣sured the Agamis can be trained to tend a flock of sheep.
It even shews a degree of jealousy of its rivals; for when at table it
bites fiercely the naked legs of the negroes, and other do∣mestics, who come
near its master.</P>
<P>The flesh of these birds, especially when they are young,
is not ill-flavoured, but is dry, and commonly hard. The rich brilliant part of
the plumage which covers the breast, is separated from the rest, and
prepared for the ornaments of dress.</P>
<P>M. De la Borde has also communicated the following particulars
in regard to this bird. 
<Q REND="inline">"The wild Agamis," says he, "are dispersed
in the back country, and are no longer found in the neighbourhood of Cayenne .
. . and they are very common in the remote unsettled tracts. . . . They are
always found in the im∣mense <PB N="399" REF="443"/> forests, in flocks from
ten and twelve to forty. . . . They fly from the ground to the low trees, where
they remain still, and in such situation the hunters often kill several
without scaring away the rest. . . . Some persons imitate their hoarse
murmur so exactly, as to decoy them to their feet. . . . When the hunters
discover a flock of Agamis, they de∣sist not till they have killed
several: these birds seldom or never fly, and their flesh is but
ordinary, black, and always hard; however, that of the young ones is more
palatable. . . . No bird is so easily tamed as this, and there are always
many of them in the streets of Cayenne. . . . They even roam out of town, but
return in due time to their master. . . . They allow one to come near them,
and handle them at pleasure; they are afraid neither of dogs, nor of birds of
prey, in the court-yard; they assume the ascendency over the poultry, and
keep them in great subjection: they feed like the hens, the <HI>Marils,</HI>
and the <HI>Paraguas;</HI> but when very young, they prefer small worms and
flesh to every thing else.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Almost all the birds have a trick of
follow∣ing people through the streets and out of town, even persons that
they had never seen before. It is difficult to get rid of them: if you enter
a house, they will wait your return, and again join you, though often after
an interval of three hours."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I have sometimes," adds M. 
<PB N="400" REF="444"/> de la Borde, "betaken myself to my heels, but they ran
faster, and always got before me; and when I stopped, they stopped
also. I know one which invariably follows all the strangers who enter its
master's house; ac∣companies them into the garden, takes as many turns as
they do, and attends them back again<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Note
communicated by M. de la Borde, King's physician as Cayenne, in
1776.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>As the habits and oeconomy of this bird were little known, I
have thought proper to transcribe the different accounts which I have
received. It appears that of all the feathered tribes, the Agami is the most
attached to the society of man; and in this respect it is as eminently
distinguished above them all, as the dog is above the other quadrupeds. The
disposition of the Agami is the more remarkable, since it is the only
bird that has a social turn; whereas several of the quadrupeds discover
attachment to man, though inferior in degree to that of the dog. And is it not
strange, that an animal, so pecu∣liarly formed for society, has never
been do∣mesticated? Nothing can better shew the im∣mense distance
between the civilized man and the rude savage, than the dominion obtained
over the lower creation. The former has made the dog, the horse, the ox, the
camel, the ele∣phant, the rein-deer, &amp;c. subservient to his utility, or
his pleasure: he has drawn together <PB N="401" REF="445"/> the hens, the
geese, the turkies, and the ducks, and has lodged the pigeons. The savage
has overlooked advantages the most obvious and the most essential to
his comfort. It is society that gives spring to activity; that awakens the
dormant faculties; and that expands, informs, and enlivens the whole!<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Gold-breasted Trumpeter:—

<HEAD>The TINAMOUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the name given
to these birds in Guiana.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THESE birds, which are peculiar to the warm parts of America,
may be regarded as a part of the gallinaceous class; for they resemble the
Bustard and Partridge, though they differ in several properties. But there
are certain habits in animals which result from the nature of the climate,
and from local circumstances, and which ought not to be deemed essential
characters.—Thus many birds, such as Partridges, which remain
constantly on the ground in Europe, perch in America; and even the palmated
aqua∣tic fowls, pass the day in the water, and return to lodge during the
night among the trees. The dangers with which they are surrounded appear to
drive them to such retreats. The im∣mense swarms of insects and
reptiles, engendered by the heat and the moisture of the climate, threaten
every moment their destruction. If they ventured to repose upon the ground,
the dense columns of ants would attack them in their slumbers, and reduce
them to skeletons. The Quails are the only birds in those countries which
rest upon the surface; and they often fall a prey to the voracity of the
serpents. Nor is it im∣probable, <PB N="403" REF="447"/> that the Quails have
been introduced since the discovery of America, and that they have not yet
acquired the habits suited to their new situation, or learned to guard
against the assaults of their numerous foes.</P>
<P>We should have ranged the genus of the <HI>Ti∣namous</HI>
after that of the Bustard; but these birds were, at that time, but
imperfectly known, and we are indebted to M. de Manoncour for the prin∣cipal
facts relating to their history, and also for the specimens presented
to the Royal Cabinet, from which we have made the descriptions.</P>
<P>The Spanish inhabitants of America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Letter of M. Godin des Odonnais, to M. de la Condamine,
1773, p. 19. note first.</BIBL></NOTE>, and the French settlers at Cayenne,
have both termed these birds <HI>Partridges;</HI> and the appellation has
been adopted by some nomenclators<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brisson.—Barrere.</NOTE>, though altogether improper:
for the <HI>Tinamous</HI> are dis∣tinguished by their long slender bill,
blunt at the tip, black above, and whitish below; their nostrils oblong,
and placed near the middle of their bill; their hind-toe is very short, and
does not rest upon the ground; their nails are very short, broad, and
channelled beneath; their legs also differ from those of Partridges, being
covered behind, as in the poultry, with scales, their whole length, shaped
like small shells; but the upper-part projects and forms inequalities not
observed on the legs of poultry. In all the Tinamous, <PB N="404" REF="448"/>
the throat and craw are thinly strewed with straggling feathers; the quills
of the tail are so short, that in some they are wholly concealed by the
superior coverts.—Thus they are improperly named Partridges, since
they differ in so many essential characters.</P>
<P>But they differ also from the Bustard, by se∣veral of
their principal characters, and especi∣ally by having a fourth toe behind,
which is wanting in the Bustard. In short, we have judged it requisite to
range them in a separate genus, under the name which they receive in their
native country.</P>
<P>All the species of the Tinamous pass the night upon the
trees, and sometimes perch during the day; but they always settle among the
lowest branches, and never mount to the summits: and this circumstance
seems to imply the probability that they are not actuated by original
impulse, but directed by considerations of safety.</P>
<P>The Tinamous are, in general, excellent for the table; their
flesh is white, firm, close, and juicy, especially about the wings, and
tastes like that of the Red Partridge. The thighs and rump have commonly a
disagreeable bitterness, which is occasioned by the fruit of the Indian
reed upon which they feed. The same bitter taste is observed in the
Ring-Pigeons which eat these fruits. But when the Tinamous live upon other
fruits, such as wild cherries, &amp;c. their flesh is uniformly delicate,
but still has none <PB N="405" REF="449"/> of the <HI>fumet.</HI> In the
sultry humid climate of Cayenne, meat will not keep more than twenty-four
hours from putrefaction, and no sort of game can be allowed time to mellow
and ac∣quire that delicious flavour which constitutes its excellence. These
birds, like all those which have a craw, often swallow the fruits without
bruising or even cracking them; they are par∣ticularly fond of the wild
cherries, and also of the produce of the <HI>common palm,</HI> and even of
that of the coffee-shrub, when they can find it. Nor do they cull their
subsistence from the trees; they only collect the fruits which have
dropped. They scrape the ground to form their nest, which is usually
nothing but a single layer of dry herbs. They lay twice a-year, and have
numerous broods; which shews that these birds and the Agamis are of the
gallinaceous class, which is remark∣ably prolific. Like these also, they
fly heavily, and to short distances, but run swiftly on the ground; they
form little flocks, and it is un∣common to find them either single or in
pairs; they call each other in all seasons; in the morn∣ing and evening,
and sometimes too during the day: this call is a slow, quavering, plaintive
whistle, which the fowlers imitate to bring them near; for this game is the
most common and the best which that country affords.</P>
<P>We shall add a remarkable circumstance with respect to
these genus of birds, that, as in the Anters, the female is larger than the
male; a <PB N="406" REF="450"/> property which in Europe is found only in the
rapacious tribe. In the shape of the body, however, and in the distribution
of the colours, the females are almost entirely like the males.</P>

a Partridge. Its flesh is as delicate as that of the other kinds, but it lays
only five or six eggs, and sometimes no more than three or four, which are
rather larger than Pigeons eggs; they are almost spherical, and as white as
those of hens. The Little Tina∣mous do not form their nest like the Great
Ti∣namous, by scraping the ground; they build it with long narrow leaves on
the lowest branches of shrubs: it is hemispherical, about six inches in
diameter, and five inches high. Of all the four species, this is the only one
which does not live constantly in the woods; it often frequents the young
straggling trees and bushes, which shoot up in land that has been
cultivated and abandoned; and sometimes it even visits dwellings.</P>

<P>NATURE has assigned these a place after the humblest of
the rapacious tribes. They are harmless and even useful; they consume not
fruits, but live upon flies, gnats, and other winged insects. The genus
comprehends nu∣merous species, which vary exceedingly in point of size,
from that of the Nightingale to that of the Shrike. Some characters however are
com∣mon to them all: their bill is compressed, broad at the base, and
almost triangular, beset with bristles, and the tip bent into a little
hook in many of the middle species and more curved in all the large
species; the tail is of consider∣able length, and only half covered by the
wings. Their bill is also scalloped near the point; a property which they
share with the Blackbird, the Thrush, and some other birds.</P>
<P>Their disposition is in general shy and solitary, and
their notes are neither lively nor melodious. Subsisting in the region of
air, they seldom leave the summits of the lofty mountains, and are rarely
seen on the ground. Their habit of cling∣ing to the branches would seem to
have increased <PB N="415" REF="460"/> the growth of their hind-toe, which in
most of the Flycatchers is longer than the fore-toe.</P>

eight inches and a half; the wings, when closed, reach to the middle of its
tail, which is two inches long; its bill is flat, broad at its base, and
eight lines long, beset with bristles: its whole plumage consists of
these three colours, gray, white, and blackish cinereous; its throat is
white; its breast and the sides of its neck are spotted with faint

<HEAD>FIG. 2. THE COMMON SPOTTED FLY-CATCHER.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="417" REF="463"/> thick vineyards. They have a
melancholy air; their disposition is wild, inanimate, and even stupid:
they place their nest, entirely exposed, either on the trees or the
bushes. No small bird is so incautious, and none has instincts so
unsettled. The nests are not of an uniform construction; some
consist entirely of moss, and others have a mixture of wool. They
con∣sume much time and labour upon the rude structure, and sometimes we
find it interwoven with thick roots, and are surprized that so small an
artificer could employ such materials. They lay three or four eggs,
sometimes five, which are covered with rufous spots.</P>
<P>These birds procure the principal part of their
subsistence while on the wing, but seldom alight, and then only by
starts, upon the ground, and never run along it. The male is not different
from the female, except that its face is more varie∣gated with brown, and its
belly is not so white. They appear in France in the spring, but the cold
weather which sometimes prevails in the middle of that season is
pernicious to them. Lottinger ob∣serves, that they almost all perished in
the snows which fell in Lorraine in April 1767 and 1772, and that they were
caught by the hand. Every degree of cold that destroys the insects, their
only support, must prove fatal to them; accord∣ingly they leave our
provinces before the frost sets in, and they are never seen after the end
of September. Aldrovandus says, that they <PB N="418" REF="464"/> do not
migrate; but this must be understood in regard to Italy, or of still
warmer coun∣tries.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Spotted

people are going in and out all day long. This bird does not make the least
pretension to song, but uses a little inward wailing note, when it thinks
its young in danger from cats or other annoyances: it breeds but once, and
retires early."</Q> When its young are able to fly, it retires with them to the
thick woods, and frolics among the high branches, sinking and rising often
perpendicularly in quest of flies, which hum below.</NOTE></P>

<P>It appears to be better known in Lorraine, and more common
than in other parts. It is rather smaller than the preceding, being
scarcely five inches long; it has no other colours than white and black,
which are dispersed in distinct spots; but its plumage
notwithstanding varies more re∣markably than that of any other bird.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="465"/> The male appears to have four different
garbs, according to the seasons. The first is that of the autumn, or
winter, when the plumage is the same with that of the female, which is not
sub∣ject to such changes. The second is worn when these birds arrive in
Provence or Italy, and is then exactly like that of the Epicurean Warbler. The
third is what they assume shortly after their appearance, and may be
termed the spring attire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">

1772.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. This is only the intermediate gradation to the fourth
state, which is that of summer, and which, as Lottinger observes, may be
properly termed its <HI>marriage suit,</HI> because it as∣sumes this at
pairing, and lays it aside after the breeding is over. The bird is then in
its full beauty: a white collar three lines broad encircles its neck, which is
of the finest black; its head is of the same colour, except the front and
the face, which are bright white; its back and its tail are stained with the
black of the head; its rump is variegated with black and white; a white
streak of a line in breadth borders for some way the outermost quills of
the tail; the wings, consisting of seventeen quills, are of a deep
chesnut; the third and the four fol∣lowing are tipt with a much lighter
brown, which, when the wings are closed, has a very fine effect: all the
quills, the two first excepted, <PB N="420" REF="466"/> have a white spot on
the outer edge, which en∣larges the nearer it is to the body; so that the
outer-edge of the last quill is entirely white; the throat, the breast, and
the belly are white; the bill and the legs black. There is a remarkable
lustre and gloss spread over the whole of the plumage; but these
beauties are gone before the beginning of July. The colours grow dilute and
dusky; the collar first disappears, and the rest soon becomes
stained and obscure, and the male is no longer distinguishable from the
female. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have frequently met with bird-catchers,"
says Lottinger, "who spread the nets on the springs in places where they
breed; and though it was only in July, they told me that they caught numbers of
females, but not a single male;"</Q> so entirely was the external
distinction of sex obliterated. That naturalist has not described so
fully the vernal plumage with which they enter into the southern provinces.
However, Aldrovandus seems to indicate the change of this Flycatcher, which
he has well described in ano∣ther place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He
describes its collar, the white spot on its wing: he com∣mends its beauty.
It is known, he says, by the fowlers of Bo∣logna, under the name of
<HI>Peglia-Mosehe.</HI></NOTE>, when, ranging it again with the Be∣cafigos,
he tells us of his having surprized it at the very instant of its
transformation, being then nei∣ther an <HI>Epicurean Warbler,</HI> nor a
<HI>Black-Cap.</HI> Al∣ready, he subjoins, the collar was become white; there
was a white spot on the front; <PB N="421" REF="467"/> white on the tail and
the wings; the under-part of the body white, and the rest black. These
properties sufficiently discriminate the Collared Black Flycatcher.</P>
<P>This bird arrives in Lorraine about the mid∣dle of April. It
lives in the forests, those espe∣cially which consist of tall trees,
and breeds in the holes of the trunks, sometimes pretty deep, and at a
considerable height above the surface of the ground. Its nest is formed
of small stalks of grass, and a little moss, which covers the bot∣tom
of the cavity. It lays six eggs. After the young are hatched, the parents
frequently go in and out, carrying supplies of food; and this care of their
infant brood often betrays the re∣treat, which would otherwise be difficult
to dis∣cover.</P>
<P>They subsist only upon flies, and other wing∣ed
insects. They are never seen on the ground; and for the most part they
keep very high, flut∣tering from tree to tree. They have no song, but only an
exceeding shrill plaintive accent, which turns upon the sharp note
<HI>crrî, crrî.</HI> They appear sad and gloomy; but their
attach∣ment to their offspring inspires activity, and even courage.</P>
<P>Lorraine is not the only province in France where the Collared
Black Flycatcher is found. Hebert has informed us, that one was seen in Brie,
but where it is little known, because it is wild and transitory. We
ourselves found one <PB N="422" REF="468"/> of these Flycatchers on the
tenth of May 1773, in a small park near Montbard in Burgundy; and it was in
the same state of plumage as that described by Brisson. Of the great
coverts, which he says are tipt with white, those only which were next the
body were such, and the more remote were brown; the inferior coverts alone of
the tail were white, the superior ones were blackish-brown; the rump was
dull pearl∣gray; the nape of the neck where the collar was situated, was
lighter than the head and the back; the middle quills of the wings were near
the tip of the same brown as the great quills; the tongue appears to be
indented at the tip, broad for the size of the bird, but proportioned to the
breadth of the bottom of the bill; the intestinal tube was eight or nine
inches long; the gizzard muscular, preceded by a dilatation of the
<HI>oesophagus;</HI> there were some marks of a <HI>coecum;</HI> and no
gall-bladder. The bird was a male, and the testicles seemed to be a line in
diameter; it weighed three gros.</P>
<P>In this species of Flycatchers, the ends of the wings meet,
and stretch beyond the middle of the tail; which is the reverse of what
generally takes place in the genus.—There are several inaccuracies in
the figures given of it in the <HI>Planches Enluminées.</HI></P>
<P>This pensive bird enjoys a quiet peaceful life, protected by
solitude. It avoids the cold season, and shifts the scene to the
genial climes of the <PB N="423" REF="469"/> south, there to renew its loves.
They are found, however, pretty far north, since they inhabit Sweden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fauna Suecica.</BIBL></NOTE>.—There are two
species from the Cape of Good Hope, which seem to be the same with that
of Lorraine; the first, being dis∣tinguished only by a rusty spot on
the breast; and the second is only the female. The differ∣ence of
appearance is very slight, if we estimate the influence of so distant a
climate.</P>

the head and wings, disposed in small waves, or small spots, without

figured in the <HI>Planches Enluminées,</HI> by the names of

Flycatcher of Senegal.</HI> These handsome birds may be described
toge∣ther; they are of the same size, and are natives of the same
climate; and the distribution of their colour is similar in both. It is
probable that they are the male and female of the same species. The white
line which passes upon the eye, and encircles the head with a sort of
little diadem, is not so entire or distinct in any other of the ge∣nus. The
first is the smaller, being only three inches and a half long; a rufous
spot covers the top of the head, which is surrounded by the 
<PB N="425" REF="471"/> white ring: from the exterior angle of the eye an oval
black spot extends, which is bounded above by the ring, and stretches into
a point near the tip of the bill; the throat is white; a light rufous spot
marks the breast; the back is light-gray, spread upon white; the tail and
the wings are blackish. A white line extends obliquely on their middle
coverts, and the same coverts are edged with scales of the rufous colour of
the breast. A glossy transparency is spread over all the plumage of
this bird; still lighter and more vivid on that of the other, which is
simpler in its colours, consisting of a mixture of light gray, of white,
and of black, and is not inferior in point of beauty; the white bar passes
upon the eyes; a horse-shoe of the same colour rises pointed under the
bill, and is cut square on the breast, which is distinguished by a
black belt; the top of the neck is black, which mingling with the white of the
back melts into gray; the quills are black, fringed with white, and the white
line of the coverts opens into festoons; the shoulders are black; but there
is a little fringed white interwoven with all this black; and through all the
white of the plumage small black shades are interspersed, which are
so light and transparent, that this little bird is more beautiful than many
which are deco∣rated with a profusion of rich and vivid tints.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Muscicapa

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fifth Species.</HEAD>
<P>We shall consider the Crested Flycatcher of the island
of Bourbon as only a variety of the Crested Flycatcher of Senegal, and both
as forming one species. The island of Bourbon, placed in the midst of a
vast ocean, and situated between the tropics, enjoys an uniform
tem∣perature, which requires not periodical migra∣tions, and when first
visited by the European ships contained no land bird. Those found in it
at present have been carried thither by chance or design; nor must it be
regarded as the native seat of original species<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We
find also two Flycatchers of the isle of Bourbon, which we shall barely
mention, convinced that they belong to some species on the continent of
Africa. The one is represented in the <HI>Illumined Plates,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 572,
Fig. 3; it is small, and quite black, except a little rufous which it has
under its tail; and, notwithstanding the differ∣ence of colour, we may
suppose it to be a variety of the Cape Flycatchers, which we have already
referred to our Collared Black Flycatcher: these differences of plumage being
apparently no other than what we see it undergo itself, and which the
influence of a hotter climate must render more extensive and rapid,
especially as it is naturally disposed to change. M. Brisson
indicates in the fol∣lowing terms the third Flycatcher of the isle of
Bourbon, to which he says the inhabitants give the name of
<HI>Tecteo:—</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Flycatcher, above brown; the edges of the
quills tawny; below tawny; <HI>(male).</HI> Dirty white; the tail-quills deep
brown; their outer edges light brown; <HI>(female).</HI>"</Q></NOTE>: we
shall therefore class <PB N="427" REF="473"/> the bird discovered on the
island with its analo∣gous one of the continent. In fact, the differ∣ences
between them are not greater than those which often occur among individuals
of this genus; their figure, their bulk, and their prin∣cipal colours, are the
same; in both the head is furnished with small feathers, half-raised
into a black crest, with green and violet reflections; this black descends
in the Senegal Flycatcher like a square spot upon the breast, and the
fore∣part of the neck. In that of Bourbon, the black covers only the head, with
the eye, and also the lower-mandible; but, in other subjects, it is
spread also upon the top of the neck. In both the under-part of the body is
of a fine light slate∣gray, and the upper-side bay, which is more vivid in
that of Bourbon, and deeper and ches∣nut in that of Senegal; and this colour,
which extends equally over the whole of the tail and wings of the last, is
intersected by a little white in the other, and assumes a deeper cast
on the coverts, which are also fringed with three lighter streaks. The
blackish colour of the quills has only a light rusty border on the
outside, and whitish on the inside of the webs. The greatest difference
occurs in the tail; that of the Bour∣bon Flycatcher is short and square,
being only two inches and a half long; the tail of the Sene∣gal Flycatcher is
more than four inches, and is tapered from the two middle quills, which are the
longest, to the outer ones, which are two <PB N="428" REF="474"/> inches
shorter. This difference may be imputed to the effect of age, season, or
of sex: at any rate, the classing of them together will excite a fuller
investigation, and an attention to the points of diserimination.</P>

upper-side of the body is deep olive-brown, except the top of the head, which
is covered by orange feathers, partly concealed by the other feathers; the
under-side of the body is greenish-yellow, which, on the rump, runs into a
fine yellow.</P>
<P>The female is somewhat larger than the male; all the
upper-side of its body is blackish-brown, mixed with a slight tint of
greenish, not so con∣spicuous as in the male; the yellow of the top of
the head forms only an oblong spot, which is partly hid by the feathers of
the general colour; the throat and the top of the neck are whitish; the
feathers of the rest of the neck, of the breast, and of the under-surface
of the wings, have their middle brown and the rest yellowish;

remarkable in this species; it does not seek the leafy boughs, but builds
on the most naked and exposed branches. The nest is the more easily

<P>We thus mark the two conspicuous colours of the plumage of
this bird, to which naturalists have hitherto given only the vague
appellation of American Flycatcher. It is hardly so large as the Yellow Wren.
A bright black is spread over the head, the throat, the back, and the
coverts; a beautiful yellow aurora is pencilled on the white gray of the
stomach, and deepens under the wings; it also appears in streaks between
the quills of the wings, and covers two-thirds of those of the tail, both
which are tipped with black, or blackish.—Such are the colours of the

blush-colour yellow. Ed∣wards gives figures of both male and female.

<P>Of all the numerous family of Flycatchers this is the most

crest, con∣sisting of small divided feathers of fine crimson,
projects in rays on its head; the same colour appears under its bill, covers
its throat, breast, belly, and reaches the coverts of its tail; an
ash-brown, intersected by some whitish waves on the edge of the
coverts, and even of the quills, covers all the upper-part of the body and
wings; the bill is very flat, and seven lines long; the tail two inches, and
exceeds the wings by ten lines; the whole length of the bird is five inches and

<P>This Flycatcher, which is five inches and a half long, is
nearly of the size of the Nightingale; all the upper-part of its body is of a
fine light rufous, with a flame cast, which extends over the small quills
of the wings, and these covering the great quills when the wings are
closed, have only a small black triangle formed by their ex∣tremities; a
brown spot covers the crown of the head; all the anterior and the upper-parts
of the body, are tipt with some slight shades of rufous; the tail is
square and spread; the bill is broad, short, and strong, and its point
reflected, and <PB N="444" REF="490"/> partaking therefore both of the
Flycatchers and of the Tyrants. We are uncertain whether to refer it to
Brisson's Rufous Flycatcher of Ca∣yenne.—It is a discouraging

<P>This beautiful Flycatcher inhabits the conti∣nent of America,
and the adjacent islands. The <PB N="445" REF="491"/> one figured in the
<HI>Planches Enluminécs</HI> was brought from Cayenne; we have received
another from St. Domingo, under the name of <HI>Crested Flycatcher of St.
Domingo.</HI> We are of opinion that these differ only by their sex: that
of St. Domingo seems to be the male; for the golden yellow of its crown is
more vivid and more spread than in the other, where the lighter tint scarce
appears through the blackish feathers which cover that part of the head. In
other respects the two birds are similar. They are rather smaller than
the Nightingale, being five inches and eight lines long; the bill is eight
lines, and scarcely curved at the tip, and the wings reach not to the middle;
the orange spot on the head is edged with a blackish ash∣colour, a white
bar crosses the face over the eyes, below which a spot of the same
colour appears that spreads, and is lost in the rusty-brown of the back;
this rusty-brown covers the wings and the tail, and becomes rather more
dilute on the edge of the small webs of the quills; a fine orange-yellow
covers the breast and the belly, which vivid colour distinguishes this
bird from all the other Flycatchers. Though the golden yellow feathers of the
crown can be erected at pleasure, as in the small European Wrens, yet,
since they are usually reclined, the bird is not properly <HI>a Crested
Flycatcher.</HI><NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the

<P>This has been named <HI>The King of the Fly∣catchers,</HI> on
account of a beautiful crown placed transversely on its head; whereas in
all other birds the crests lie longitudinally. It consists of four or
five rows of small round feathers, spread like a fan, ten lines broad, all
of a bright bay co∣lour, and terminated with a little black spangle; so
that it might be taken for a peacock's tail in miniature.</P>
<P>This bird is also remarkably shaped, and seems to
combine the features of the Flycatchers, of the <HI>Moucherolles,</HI> and of
the Tyrants. It is scarcely larger than the European Flycatcher, and has a
disproportioned bill, which is ten lines in length, and very broad and flat,
beset with bristles that reach almost to its tip, which is hooked. The
<HI>tarsus</HI> is short; the toes slender; the wing is not more than
three inches, nor the tail more than two. It has a small white eye-brow; its
throat is yellow; a blackish collar encircles its neck, and joins that tinge
which covers the back, and changes on the wing into a deep fulvous brown. The
quills of the tail are light bay; and the same colour, though more dilute,
stains the rump and the belly; the whitish colour of the stomach is

<P>The first<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the

nearly the same. Its plumage is olive, without any yellow on the head, but a
few light shades of greenish appear on the lower-part of its back and on
its belly; and small lines of yellowish white are traced on the blackish
quills, and on the coverts of the wings.—It is found in the warm parts of

<P>The second<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is the

hardly three inches long; its head, and the beginning of the neck, are partly
yellow, partly black, each yellow fea∣ther having in its middle a black
streak, which shews the two colours disposed in long and alter∣nate
spots; the feathers of the back, the wings, and their coverts, are black
cinereous, and edged with greenish; the tail is very short, the wing
still shorter; the bill is slender, and lengthened, which gives this
little Flycatcher a peculiar ap∣pearance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The useful destination of the Flycatchers will occur to
the most superficial observer. The insect tribes elude the interference
of man; and though despicable as individuals, they often be∣come formidable
by their numbers. Instances are recorded of their multiplying to such an
amazing degree as to darken the air; of their devouring the whole vegetable
productions; and of their carrying in their train the accumulated ills of
famine and pestilence. Happily for man∣kind such calamities are rare, and
Nature has wisely provided the proper remedies. Most birds search for
insects' eggs; many feed on their groveling <HI>larvae;</HI> some live upon
their crustaceous crysalids; and the Flycatchers seize them after they
escape from prison, exulting on their wings. Hence in autumn, when these
birds migrate into other climates, the swarms of <PB N="449" REF="495"/>
gnats, flies, and beetles, are in our latitudes more than usually numerous.
But in the tropi∣cal countries, where heat and moisture conspire to ripen
the exuberance of insect life, the Fly-catchers are more essential. All
Nature is ba∣lanced, and the circle of generation and destruc∣tion is
perpetual! The philosopher contemplates with tender melancholy this cruel
system of war; he strives in vain to reconcile it with his ideas of
benevolence of intention: but he is forcibly struck with the nice
adjustment of the various parts, their mutual connexion and subordina∣tion,
and the unity of plan which pervades the whole.</P>

<HEAD>The MOUCHEROLLES.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall term those Moucherolles which are larger than the
common Flycatchers, but smaller than the Tyrants; and to avoid confu∣sion,
we shall range them in two divisions, cor∣responding to their size. As
the Moucherolles are intermediate between the Flycatchers and the Tyrants, they
participate of the nature of both.</P>
<P>They are found in both continents; but they are different
species which occur in each. The ocean that intervenes between the tropics is
the great barrier, which none but the palmipede birds, from their facility in
resting on the water, can pass.</P>
<P>In the hot climates Nature sports in the luxu∣riance of her
productions. Many species of birds, such as the Widow-birds, the
Mouche-rolles, and the Bee-eaters, which inhabit those sultry regions, are
furnished with tails of un∣common length: this character distinguishes
the Moucherolles from the Flycatchers, from which they differ also in having
their bill somewhat stronger, and more hooked at the tip.</P>

<HI>Forked-tail Tyrant of Cayenne;</HI> it is distinguished however by its
bill, which is more slender and not so much hooked as in the Tyrants. It is
called <HI>the Widow</HI> at Cayenne; but this name is appropriated to another
kind of birds, which it resembles in nothing except the length of its tail.
It con∣stantly haunts the flooded savannas, and for that reason we have
termed it the <HI>Savana.</HI> It is ob∣served to perch upon the adjacent
trees, and to alight every minute upon the clods or grassy tufts which
rise above the surface of the water, jerking its tail like the Wagtails. It
is as large as the Crested Lark; the quills of its tail are black, the two
outermost nine inches long, and forked, the two following only three inches
and a half, and the rest gradually shorter, so that the two mid-ones are
only an inch:—and thus, though the bird is fourteen inches long,
mea∣suring from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, the distance
between its bill and its nails <PB N="452" REF="499"/> is only six inches. On
the crown of its head is a yellow spot, which is however wanting in many
subjects, these being probably females. A short blackish square hood
covers the back of its head; beyond that, the plumage is white, which colour
advances under the bill, and spreads over all the anterior and under-part of

the first and third being males, and the second, which is rather larger, a
female; a property which, though principally confined to the birds of prey,
obtains also in the Flycatcher, the Moucherolles, and the Tyrants.</P>
<P>The male is seven inches long, the female eight inches and
one-fourth; this excess being almost entirely in the tail; but its body is
also somewhat thicker, and of the size of a common Lark: in both, the
head and the top of the neck are covered, as far as the circular division in
the middle, with black, shining with a green or bluish gloss, whose
lustre is like that of burn∣ished steel: its head is decorated with a
beautiful crest, which falls loosely back; its eyes are flame-coloured; its
bill is ten lines in length, a little arched near the tip, reddish, and
beset with pretty long bristles. All the rest of the body of the female
is white, except the great quills, through which the black appears at the tips
of the wings when closed; there are two rows of black streaks on the
small quill-feathers and in the great coverts; and the shafts of the
tail-quills are uniformly black throughout.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="501"/> In the male, the breast, below the
black hood, is bluish-gray, and the stomach and all the under-part of the
body white: a bright bay robe covers all the upper-part to the end of the tail,
which is oval shaped and regularly tapered, the two middle quills being the
largest, and the others shortening two or three lines each: the same is
the case in the female.</P>
<P>According to Adanson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Supplement de l'Encyclopedie, tome i.</BIBL></NOTE>, this
Moucherolle lodges among the mangrove-trees, which grow in the solitary and
unfrequented spots along the banks of the Niger and of the Gambra. Seba
places it in Brazil, and ranges it with the birds of Paradise, applying the
Brazilian appellation <HI>Acamacu</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brasilian Paradise-bird, or Crested Cuiriri Acamacu.</NOTE>;
but little can be relied upon the accuracy of that collector of Natural
History, who so often bestows names without discernment. It is very
unlikely that this bird could be found both in Africa and Brazil; yet
Brisson founds his classification upon the authority of Seba, at the
same time that he expresses a suspicion, that Seba was mistaken.

wings, and of its tail, deep brown; an even blackish on the tail: its neck,
its breast, and its belly are of a lighter brown; a dull red cast appears
on the lower coverts of its tail, which is three inches long, and consists
of twelve equal quills, and only two-thirds of it covered by the wings; the
bill is ten lines and a half, and the whole length of the bird is eight

<P>The name <HI>Schet</HI> is applied in Madagascar to a
beautiful long-tailed <HI>Moucherolle;</HI> and two others are called
<HI>Schet-all,</HI> and <HI>Schet-Vouloulou,</HI> which seem to denote the
Rufous Schet and the Variegated Schet, and mark only two varieties of the
same species. Brisson reckons three; but a few <PB N="460" REF="507"/>
differences in the colours are not sufficient to constitute distinct
species, where the shape, the size, and all the other proportions, are
the same.</P>
<P>The Schets have the long form of the Wag-tail; they are rather
larger, measuring six inches and a half to the end of the true tail, not to
mention two feathers which extend almost five inches farther; the bill is
seven lines, triangular, very flat, broad at the base, beset with
bristles at the corners, and with hardly any perceptible curve at the point:
a beautiful black∣ish-green crest, with the lustre of burnished
steel, is bent smooth back, and covers the head; the iris is yellow, and
the eye-lid blue.</P>
<P>In the first variety, the same dark colour that paints the
crest, encircles the neck, and invests the back, the great quills of the
wings and of the tail, of which the two long feathers mea∣sure seven
inches, and are white, as are also the small quills of the wings, and all
the under-part of the body.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Schet-all,</HI> the colour of the crest ap∣pears
only on the great quills of the wings, whose coverts are marked with broad
white lines; all the rest of the plumage is a bright gilded bay, which
Edwards terms a <HI>fine shining cinnamon,</HI> which is spread equally
over the tail and the two long projecting shafts; these shafts are
similar to those which are sent off from the tail in the Angola and
Abyssinian Rollers, only <PB N="461" REF="508"/> in these birds they are
the outermost, while in the Madagascar Moucherolle they occupy the
middle.</P>
<P>The third variety, or the <HI>Schet-Vouloulou,</HI> has
scarcely any difference from the preceding, except that the two projecting
feathers of the tail are whitish; the rest of the plumage is bay-coloured,
as in the <HI>Schet-all.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Schet-all</HI> which is preserved in the King's
Cabinet, these two feathers are six inches long; in another specimen, I
found them to be eight inches, and the outer webs edged with black
three-fourths of their length, and the remainder white; in a third, these two
long feathers were entirely wanting; whether we must impute this to some
accident, to the age, or to the moulting, which Edwards thinks lasts six
months in these birds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">

believe it is natural to some birds which have these long tails, to want
them six months in the year . . . . which I have seen in some long∣tailed

straight to the tip, where it is hooked: its tongue is acute and

<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by the</HI> CHEVALIER
DESHAYES.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>At Cayenne, this Tyrant is called <HI>Titiri,</HI> from the
resemblance to its shrill noisy screams. The male and female keep
commonly together in the cleared spots of the forests; they perch on the
lofty trees; and are very numerous in Guiana. They breed in the hollow trunks,
or in the clefts of the branches below the shade of the most leafy bough.
If one attempts to plunder their young, their natural audacity changes into
in∣trepid fury; they contend obstinately; they dart upon the person;
pursue him; and if, in spite of all their exertions, they are unable to
rescue their dear offspring, they fondly visit the cage, and carry
food.</P>
<P>This bird, though small, appears to dread no sort of
animal. 
<Q REND="inline">"Instead of fleeing, like the other birds,"
says Deshayes, "or concealing itself from the rapacious tribes, it
attacks them with intrepidity, and harasses them to such a degree, that
it generally succeeds in driving them off. No animal dares to come near the 
<PB N="466" REF="514"/> tree where it breeds. It pursues to a consider∣able
distance, and with implacable obstinacy, all that it conceives to be its
enemies, dogs espe∣cially, and birds of prey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>M.
Deshayes.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> It is not even inti∣midated at man; so lately
has his empire been established in those savage countries, that it
seems not conscious of his power<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"I shot a young one, which was only
slightly wounded. My little negro who ran after it was attacked by a Shrike

rid of it." 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by M. de</HI>
Manoncour.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. In the moments of its fury it shuts its bill
forcibly, which occa∣sions a quick repeated cracking.</P>
<P>In St. Domingo this bird is named <HI>Pipiri,</HI> which, as
well as <HI>Titiri,</HI> expresses its usual cry or squall. It is
distinguished into two varieties, or two contiguous species: the first
is the <HI>Great Pipiri,</HI> of which we have just spoken, and which is
called in that country <HI>The Black-headed Pipiri,</HI> or <HI>The
Thick-billed Pipiri;</HI> the other is called <HI>The Yellow-headed
Pipiri,</HI> or <HI>The Migratory Pipiri,</HI> and is smaller and weaker. The
upper∣part of the body in the last is gray, fringed throughout with white;
but in the Great Pipiri it is fringed with rufous. The disposition of the
small Pipiris is also much milder, and not so savage as the others.
These remain sequestered in the wilderness, and are never met with
ex∣cept in pairs; while the small Pipiris appear often in troops, and come
near the settlements. <PB N="467" REF="515"/> They assemble in
considerable flocks during the month of August, and haunt those places
which yield certain kinds of berries that attract the beetles and insects. At
that time these birds are very fat, and are caught for the table<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>M. Deshayes.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though they are called Migratory Pipiris, it is not probable,
says Deshayes, that they ever quit the island of St. Domingo, which is of
suf∣ficient extent to admit local changes. In fact, they leave their usual
haunts in certain seasons, and follow the maturity of the fruits which feed
their insect prey. All their other habits are the same as those of the
Great Pipiris: both species are very numerous in St. Domingo, and few birds
occur in more frequency<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"They are seen in the forests, in the
abandoned grounds, in the cultivated spots; they like every situation; yet
the species of the Yellow-headed Pipiris, which are the most numerous,
seem to prefer the settled parts. In winter they come near the houses;
and as this season from the mildness of the climate corresponds to the
spring in France, it seems that the coolness which then pre∣vails
inspires them with cheerfulness. Never are they seen so noisy, or
so joyous, as in the months of November and December. They frolic with each
other, toy, and caress." 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by M.</HI>
Deshayes.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They live upon caterpillars, beetles, butter∣flies, and
wasps. They perch on the highest summit of trees, and especially on the
palms, from thence they descry the insect as it roves in the air, and the
instant that they seize it they return again to their bough. They seem
most engaged from seven in the morning till ten; <PB N="468" REF="516"/> and
again from four o'clock in the afternoon till six. It is amusing to see
them hunting their fugacious prey, and pursuing their devious course; but
their lofty conspicuous station ex∣poses them perpetually to the eye of
the fowler.</P>

disposition and its habits are the same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"The courage of this little bird is
singular. He pursues and puts to flight all kinds of birds that come near
his station, from the smallest to the largest, none escaping his
fury; nor did I ever see any that dared to oppose him while flying, for he
does not offer to attack them when sitting. I have seen one of them fix on
the back of an Eagle, and persecute him so that he has turned on his back
into various postures in the air, in order to get rid of him; and at last
was forced to alight on the top of the next tree, from whence he dared not to
move till the little Tyrant was tired, or thought fit to leave him.—This
is the constant practice of the cock, while the hen is breeding; he sits on
the top of a bush, or small tree not far from her nest, near which if any
small birds approach, he drives them away; but the great ones, as Crows,
Hawks, Eagles, he will not suffer to come within a quarter of a mile of him
without attacking them. They have only a chattering note, which they utter with
great vehemence all the time they are fighting.—When their young are
flown they are as peaceable as other birds." 
<BIBL>CATESBY.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. But it is
distin∣guished by its red crown, and the manner of placing its nest,
which is left entirely exposed in the shrubs or bushes; whereas the
Pipiri con∣ceals its nest, or even lodges it in the holes of trees. It is
nearly of the same size as the Great Pipiri: its bill seems less
hooked: Catesby says only <HI>that it is broad, flat, and tapering.</HI>
The red <PB N="470" REF="518"/> spot on the upper-part of its head is very
bril∣liant, and is encircled with black feathers, which conceal it when they
are closed.—This bird ap∣pears in Virginia and Carolina about the month
of April; there breeds, and departs in the be∣ginning of winter.</P>
<P>A bird sent to the King's cabinet, under the name of
<HI>Louisiana Tyrant,</HI> appears to be exactly the same with the Carolina
Tyrant of Catesby. It is larger than the fifth species, or Cayenne Tyrant,
and almost equal to the Great Pipiri of St. Domingo. An ash-colour,
almost black, is spread over all the upper-part of the body, from the crown
of the head to the end of the tail, which terminates in a small white bar
shaped into festoons; light whitish waves are inter∣mixed in the small
quills of the wing; some small streaks of deep orange, inclined to red,
shine through the blackish quills on the top of the head; the throat is of
a pretty pure white, which is shaded with black on the breast, and again
becomes snowy from the stomach as far as the tail.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The Carolina Tyrant builds its nest with wool and moss, and

broadish, and three inches long; its legs and feet are brown. Its head, the
upper-part of its neck, the whole of its back, its wings, and its tail, are of

yellow; they are called by the Brazilians, Cuiriri. In every other respect
they are like the <HI>Pitangua-Guacu.</HI>"

size of the Stare (we will observe that it is thicker, and more bulky); and
represents its bill as thick, broad, and pyramidal, its edges sharp, and
more than an inch long; its head bulky; its neck short; the head, the top of

brown, slightly shaded with dull green; <PB N="472" REF="520"/> its throat
white, and also the little bar on the eye; the breast and belly yellow; and

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Sixth Species.</HEAD>
<P>This is the <HI>Spotted Flycatcher of Cayenne,</HI> as
represented in the <HI>Planches Enluminées;</HI> but the hooked form
of its bill, its strength, its size, and its disposition, entitle it to
the name of Tyrant. <PB N="474" REF="522"/> It is called <HI>Caudec</HI> at
Cayenne, and is eight inches long; the bill is scalloped at the edges near
the hooked point, is beset with bristles, and is thirteen lines long. Dark
gray and white, intermixed with some rusty lines on the wings, compose
its varied plumage; white predominates on the under surface of the body,
where it is sprinkled with long blackish spots; the blackish, on the
other hand, is the prevailing colour on the back, where the white forms only
some edgings. Two white lines run obliquely, the one over the eyes, the other
below them; small blackish feathers half conceal the yellow spot on the
crown of the head. The feathers of the tail, which are black in the middle,
have broad borders of rufous; the hind nail is the strongest of
all.—The <HI>Caudec</HI> haunts the creeks, and perches on the low
branches of trees, feed∣ing probably upon aquatic insects. It is less
fre∣quent than the <HI>Titiri,</HI> but has the same audacity and cruelty. In
the female, the yellow spot is wanting on the head; and in some males that
spot is orange, a difference which is perhaps owing to the age.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Seventh Species.</HEAD>
<P>This bird was sent from Louisiana to the Royal cabinet,
under the name of <HI>Flycatcher,</HI> but ought to be ranged with the Tyrants.
It is as large as the Red-backed Shrike; its bill is long, flat, beset with
bristles, and hooked; its plumage is gray-brown on the head and back, light
slate-colour on the throat, yellowish on the belly, and light rufous on the
great coverts; its wings cover only the third part of its tail, which is a
brown ash-colour, shaded with a little rufous from the wings. We are
unacquainted with its instincts, but these features sufficiently
charac∣terize it; and as it has the strength of the Pipiris, it probably has
also their habits.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the
<HI>Muscicapa Ludoviciana:—</HI>

<P>THIS bird is distinguished from the Fly∣catchers by its
size, being almost as large as a Shrike; but it resembles them in many
other characters; though a contiguous species, there∣fore, it cannot be
included among them, but evinces that our artificial divisions correspond
not to the discriminating lines traced by Nature. The Kinki-Manou is eight
inches and a half long, and is bulky; its head is black; and that colour
extends like a round hood on the top of its neck and under its bill; the
upper-part of its body is cinereous, and the under-part ash-blue; the bill is
slightly hooked at the tip, and not so strong as that of the Shrike, nor
even so strong as that of the Little Tyrant; a few short bristles
rise from the corner of the bill; the legs are of a lead colour, and thick
and strong.</P>

<HEAD>The RED FLYCATCHER.</HEAD>
<P>I am of opinion that the <HI>Red Flycatcher</HI> of Catesby,
and the <HI>Red Carolina Flycatcher</HI> of Bris∣son, cannot be referred to
the genus of the Fly∣catchers, or that of the Moucherolles; for though its
size, the length of its tail, and even its mode of life, seem to be
analogous, its bill is thick, large, and yellowish, which rather points its
re∣lation to the Yellow Bunting. We shall there∣fore regard it as an
anomalous species. It is thus described by Catesby: 
<Q REND="inline">"It is about the bulk of a Sparrow; it has
large black eyes; its bill is thick, strong, and yellowish: the whole of
the bird is of a fine red, except the inner fringes of the wing-quills, which
are brown; but those fringes are not seen unless the wings are spread:
it is a bird of passage, and leaves Carolina and Virginia in the winter;
the fe∣male is brown, with a yellow shade."</Q> Edwards also describes
it, and admits, that it has the bill of the granivorous class, only
<HI>longer.</HI> I think, adds he, that Catesby found that these birds feed
upon flies, since he gives the Latin appellation of <HI>Muscicapa
Rubra.</HI></P>

<P>Though nomenclators have classed this bird with the
Flycatchers, it appears to differ widely both from these, and from the
Moucherolles; we have therefore separated it entirely, and assigned it
the name of <HI>Drongo,</HI> which it receives in Madagascar. Its characters
are: 1. Its bulk, being larger than the Blackbird, and thicker: 2. The tuft on
the origin of the bill: 3. Its bill is not so flat: 4. The tarsus and toes
are very strong. All its plumage is black, varying with green; directly under
the root of the upper∣mandible some long and very narrow feathers rise
erect to the height of an inch and eight lines; they bend forward, and make a
very odd sort of crest; the two outer-quills of the tail project an inch
and seven lines beyond the two middle ones; the others are of an intermediate
length, and diverge, which occasions the tail to be very forked. Commerson
assures us, that the Drongo has a pleasant warble, which he com∣pares to
the song of the Nightingale; and this makes a wide difference from the
Tyrants, which have all shrill cries, and are besides natives of America.
This Drongo was first brought from <PB N="479" REF="527"/> Madagascar by
Poivre; it has also come from the Cape of Good Hope, and from China. We have
remarked that the crest is wanting in some specimens, and we have no
doubt that the bird sent to the Royal cabinet under the name of <HI>the
Forked-tail Flycatcher of China,</HI> belongs to this species, and is perhaps
a female; the resem∣blance, if we except the crest, being entire be∣tween
this Chinese bird and the Drongo.</P>
<P>There is also a kind of Drongo found on the Malabar coast,
whence it was sent by Sonnerat: it is rather larger than that of
Madagascar, or that of China; its plumage is wholly black, but its bill is
stronger and thicker; it has not the crest; and what the most
distinguishes it are, the two long shafts which project from the ends of
the two outer-quills of the tail; they are almost bare for six inches of
their length, and have webs near their extremities as at their origin. We are
unacquainted with the habits of this bird of Malabar; but they are probably the
same as those of the Drongo of Madagascar, since the external
characters are alike in both.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the

<P>The Piauhau is larger than any of the Tyrants, and is
therefore excluded from the Flycatchers; indeed, except in its bill, it bears
not the least analogy to these, and seems to occupy a detached place in
the order of Nature.</P>
<P>It is eleven inches long, and is larger than the Missel
Thrush. All its plumage is deep black, except a deep purple spot that
covers the throat in the male, but is wanting in the female; the wings, when
closed, extend as far as the end of the tail; the bill is sixteen lines
long, and eight broad at the base, very flat, and shaped almost like an
isosceles triangle, with a small hook at the point.</P>
<P>These birds move in flocks, and commonly precede the
Toucans, and always uttering the shrill cry <HI>pihauhau:</HI> it is said
that they feed upon fruits like the Toucans; but probably they also eat the
winged insects, for the catch∣ing of which Nature seems to have fashioned
their bill. They are very lively, and almost in continual motion. They
reside only in the woods like the Toucans, and generally haunt the same
spots.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="529"/> Brisson asks if the Jacapu of
Marcgrave be not the same with the Piauhau<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Jacupu, a bird of the bulk of a Lark; its
tail extended; its legs short and black; its nails sharp on the four toes;
its bill somewhat curved and black, half an inch long; its whole body is
clothed with black shining feathers; but under the throat, spots of
vermilion are mixed with this black."</Q></NOTE>? We may answer that it is
not. The Jacapu of Marc∣grave has indeed a black plumage, with only a purple,
or rather a red spot under its throat; but at the same times, <HI>its tail
is long, its wing is short, and its size is that of a Lark;</HI> these
cha∣racters do not apply to the Piauhau.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific
character of the <HI>Muscicapa Rubricollis:—</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"It is black, a great space on its chin
and throat red."</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>Thus the Kinki-Manou and the Drongo of Madagascar, the Red
Flycatcher of Virginia and the Piahau of Cayenne, are all contiguous species,
but essentially different from those of the Flycatchers, the
<HI>Moucherolles,</HI> and the Tyrants.</P>
