<P>DOCTOR LAST IN HIS CHARIOT: A COMEDY: As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN THE HAY-MARKET.</P>

<HEAD>TO SAMUEL FOOTE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO', had this comedy failed, which, from it's first night's reception, was some∣what more than probable, I should cer∣tainly have suffered the whole disgrace, it is not with less readiness, that I seize this opportunity, on its better success, to acknowledge the obligations which the editor of DOCTOR LAST IN HIS CHARIOT has to Mr. FOOTE.</P>
<P>I am indebted to you for undertaking a very long part; which, in your circumstan∣ces, I consider as a particular favour: I am indebted to you, for exerting unusual spi∣rit in the performance, when there was little hopes of putting the audience in a good humour; and more, (don't be a∣shamed when I boast of it) I am indebted to you, not only for a whole scene, the consultation of physicians in the first act, but for several hints throughout the piece, which had the happiest effect, tho' some of them may, perhaps, have suffered by being cloathed in my language.</P>
<P>I am more particularly acknowledging upon this occasion, because, in the repeated remarks which the news-papers have
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/> thought proper to make on your address to the public, the first night this thing was acted, they would insinuate, that you used the advantage your situation gave you, of a personal application to the audience, in order to throw contempt upon the piece while that and it's author were immedi∣ately under your protection.</P>
<P>However, Sir, while I return you those thanks which, justice and gratitude oblige me to; I am extremely doubtful whether the public will consider the favours I con∣fess, as any capital exertion of benevo∣lence on your part; for they will naturally say, that, as to your acting, the play could not possibly have done without it, which, after you had received it, must have been to your loss; and, for giving me your wit and humour, all the world is sensible, that there is scarcely a man living who has so much to spare. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most obliged humble servant, THE EDITOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following piece is a translation of Le MALADE IMAGINAIRE, one of MOLIERE's most celebrated productions in the farcical kind. Some scenes which could not possibly succeed upon the English stage, have been removed, and those substituted, in which the character of DOCTOR LAST is introduced; and, for that character only, the editor has to answer; no∣thing else in the subsequent scenes, being intirely his.</P>
<P>How it has hitherto appeared upon the stage, or how it may appear hereafter, is at present of little consequence. It is submitted to the can∣dour of intelligent readers, who will consider a farce as such, and decide upon it's merit ac∣cordingly. To add more is needless, except thanks to the performers, particularly to Mr. Sowdon, for his kindness to the editor, when he stood in great need of assistance; and to that admirable comedian, Mr. Weston, by whose excellent performance, Dr. Last is still render'd a laughable object.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by D. GARRICK, Esq. and spoken by Mr. FOOTE.</BYLINE>
<L>YOUR servants, kind masters, from bottom to top.</L>
<L>Be assur'd, while I breath, or can walk—I mean hop,</L>
<L>Be you pleased to smile, or be pleased to grumble,</L>
<L>Be whatever you please, I am still your most humble.</L>
<L>As to laugh is a right only given to man,</L>
<L>To keep up that right is my pride and my plan—</L>
<L>Fair ladies, don't frown, I meant woman too—</L>
<L>What's common to man, must be common to you.—</L>
<L>You all have a right your sweet muscles to curl,</L>
<L>From the old smirking prude, to the titt'ring young girl;</L>
<L>And ever with pleasure my brains I could spin,</L>
<L>To make you all giggle, and you, ye gods, grin.</L>
<L>In this present summer, as well as the past,</L>
<L>To your favour again we present Dr. Last,</L>
<L>Who, by wonderful feats, in the papers recounted,</L>
<L>From trudging on foot, to his chariot has mounted.</L>
<L>Amongst the old Britons, when war was begun,</L>
<L>Charioteers would slay ten, while the foot could slay one:</L>
<L>So, when doctors on wheels with dispatches are sent,</L>
<L>Mortality bills rise a thousand per cent.</L>
<L>But think not to physic that quack'ry's confin'd,</L>
<L>All the world is a stage, and the quacks are mankind—</L>
<L>There's trade, law, and state-quacks; nay, would we but search,</L>
<L>We should find—Heaven bless us!—some quacks in the church!</L>
<L>The stiff band, and stiff bob of the methodist race,</L>
<L>Give the balsam of life and the tincture of grace,</L>
<L>And their poor wretched patients think much good is done 'em,</L>
<L>Tho' blisters and causticks are ever upon them.</L>
<L>As for law and the state, if quack'ry's a curse,</L>
<L>Which will make the good bad, and the bad will make worse,</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>We should point out the quack, from the regular brother,</L>
<L>They are wiser than I who can tell one from t'other!</L>
<L>Can the stage with its bills, puffs, and patents, stand trial,</L>
<L>Shall we find out no quacks in the Theatre Royal?</L>
<L>Some dramatical drugs that are puff'd on the town,</L>
<L>Cause many wry faces, and scarce will <HI>go down.</HI></L>
<L>Nay, an audience sometimes will in quack'ry delight,</L>
<L>And sweat down an author some pounds in one night.</L>
<L>To return to our quack—should he, help'd by the weather,</L>
<L>Raise laughter and kind perspiration together,</L>
<L>Should his nostrums of hips and of vapours but cure ye,</L>
<L>His chariot he well will deserve, I assure ye.</L>
<L>'Tis easy to set up a chariot in town,</L>
<L>And easier still is that chariot laid down.</L>
<L>He petitions by me, both as doctor and lover,</L>
<L>That you'll not stop his wheels, or his chariot tip over:</L>
<L>Fix him well, I beseech you, the worst on't would be,</L>
<L>Should you overturn <HI>him,</HI> you may <HI>overset me.</HI></L>

<P>WELL, but, Mrs. Prudence, don't be in a passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Wag, I will be in a passion; and it's enough to put any one in a passion to have to do with such indiscreet people as your master. I believe he's out of his senses for my part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wag.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's in love, Mrs. Prudence, and that's half way.</P>

<P>So often as he has been forbid either to come or send after my mistress, to persist, in spite of all our cautions and interdictions—</P>

<P>He does not come or send, child.</P>

<P>No—what do you do here then, and be hang'd to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wag.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only bring a letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very pretty jesting, truly. I was afraid that some of the family wou'd take notice of my<PB N="2" REF="9"/> talking to you in the hall—But, in truth, here is no place of safety in the house; for now I've brought you up here, I'm afraid every moment of my master's surprizing us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wag.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does the old gentleman always keep the house then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Keep the house!—he generally keeps his chamber, and very often his bed. You must know he's one of those folks that are always sick, continually complaining, ever taking phy∣sic, and, in reality, never ailing any thing. I'm his nurse, with a plague to him, and he worries me out of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wag.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd I were sick upon the same con∣ditions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, no fooling.—You said you had a letter from your master to my young lady: give it me, and I'll deliver it to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wag.</SPEAKER>
<P>There it is, my dear.</P>

<P>But am not I a very naughty wench to be accessary, in this manner, to a clandestine correspondence?</P>

<P>Really that's much—Very much upon my word, that a man of low birth, and bred up to a mean profession—for, tho' the doctor has now fifteen thousand pounds in the funds, and gets eight or nine hundred a year, he owes all to his medicinal secrets.</P>

<P>Mr. Trash! Has Mr. Hargrave any thing to do then—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ail.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hargrave! who the devil's he? I am talking of the person you are to marry, Dr. Last, whose cordial has done me so much service. It seems he is a widower, and has a mind to get a second wife that may do him some credit; such as his worldly circumstances intitle him to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but my dear Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ail.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, child, I know it's very well—The doctor is to be brought here to-day to be in∣troduced<PB N="10" REF="17"/> to me, and I am really concern'd that I appointed Dr. Coffin, Dr. Skeleton, and Dr. Bulruddery, to hold a consultation upon my case this morning; for I have found so much benefit from Dr. Last's medicine, that I think he will be the properest person to find out what's the matter with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but, Sir, give me leave to tell you that Dr. Last was very far from my thoughts when we began this conversation. In short, papa, all this while you have been talking of one person and I of another.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Ail.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what business have you to be meddling, impudence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No business at all, Sir—But, if you are really serious in your design about this marriage, give me leave to ask you, what can have put it into your head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ail.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have nothing to do with that—I have told the girl the party I propose for her is rich; but, if you must know what most in∣clin'd, and, indeed, determin'd me, as it were, to accept of Dr. Last for a son-in-law, is the number of invaluable secrets he possesses; and this alliance will intitle me to take his medicines gratis, as my various infirmities may require—a thing that we ought all to consider, my last year's apothecary's bill amounting to two hundred and nineteen pounds, four shillings and eleven pence.</P>

<P>Sneezing, Dr. Bulruddery, was a mor∣tal symptom that attended a pestilential disease, which formerly depopulated the republic of Athens; ever since, when that convulsion oc∣curs, a short ejaculation is offered up, that the sneezing or sternuting party, may not be afflicted with the same distemper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bulrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my conscience, a very learned account! ay, and a very civil institution too. I can't help thinking, doctor, but the gentle∣men
<PB N="19" REF="26"/> of our profession must arrive much better in them there foreign parts, than at home: now, because why, one hears of plagues and pestilences, and such like kind of disorders that attack a whole nation at once.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, doctor; and, since the great increase of this town, the sick lie so scattered, that one pair of horses are scarce sufficient for a physician but in moderate practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Skel.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; why, there was yesterday, the first pulse I felt belonged to a lad with the measles, in Dean's-yard, Westminster: from thence I set out between seven and eight, my wig fresh powdered, and my horses in spirits; I turned at Charing Cross for the New Buildings; then run through the Holbourn division, crossed the Fleet-market, and penetrated into the city as far as Whitechapel; then, made a short trip to the wife of a salesman, who had the gout in her stomach, at Wapping; from thence, re∣turned through Cornhill, Temple-Bar, and the Strand, and finished my last prescription, be∣tween five and six, for a tradesman in Cock∣spur-street, who had burst a vein in hallooing at the Brentford election.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bulrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my conscience, a long tour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Skel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Long! Why, upon the most moderate calculation, I could not, before I sat down to my soup, have run up less than thirty pair of stairs; and my horses must have trotted, taking in cross-streets and turnings, at least, eighteen miles and three quarters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bulrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt. But you was talk∣ing of Brentford.—Don't you look upon a con∣tested<PB N="20" REF="27"/> election as a good thing to the faculty, doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Skel.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean to us of the college, Dr. Bulruddery, little or nothing: if, indeed, there should happen to be warm work at the hust∣ings, the corporation of surgeons may pick up some practice, tho' I don't look upon any of these public transactions as of any great use to our body, in general.

<P>Is it a secret to what you made it amount?</P>

<P>Why; what with colds caught on the water before dinner, repletion and indigestion at dinner, inebriety after dinner, (not to men∣tion the ball in the evening) we made that day, and its consequences, for you know, there are fine foundations laid for future disorders, espe∣cially if it turns out an easterly wind.—</P>

<P>Yes, you have, and its one of the six and twenty disorders specified in my adver∣tisement; and I challenge all England to do the like, to cure six and twenty disorders with one medicine, without confinement, or hinderance of business, or knowledge of a bedfellow. You understand me, for that's in it too, if you have any remains lurking in your blood from bad treatment.</P>

<P>No, Mr. Hargrave, I cannot, indeed; you have been told so a thousand times already: I sent you word so by your servant this morn∣ing, but you won't be satisfied; and, as if you had not been imprudent enough already, you are now come here in person, to put the finish∣ing stroke to our ruin.</P>

<P>No, my good Prue, I was aware of that, and am not come here in my own charac∣ter, but as a friend of your young lady's Italian master, who has given me leave to say he has sent me in his place.</P>

<P>True—Nor is it my fault that it has not been done; I spoke to Mr. Friendly, Mr. Ail∣wou'd's brother-in-law, who assur'd me he wou'd make it his business to come here this day for that purpose.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by a LITTLE GIRL of Five Years old.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>LADIES and gentlemen, they've sent me out—</L>
<L>But I'm afraid to tell you what about;</L>
<L>Because 'twere bold in me, perhaps you'll say,</L>
<L>To come to ask you how you like the play:</L>
<L>Yet that's my business; nay, more free to make,</L>
<L>I'm come to beg you'd like it for my sake.</L>
<L>The author took me in his arms just now,</L>
<L>My dear, says he—he kiss'd me too I vow—</L>
<L>If you'll go out and make the audience clap,</L>
<L>I'll give you ribbons and a fine new cap:</L>
<L>Besides, he promis'd me, next time he comes</L>
<L>Behind the scenes, to bring me sugar-plumbs.</L>
<L>But whatsoe'er you think the play to be,</L>
<L>When you go home I'm sure you'll talk of me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Says Lady Stingo to Sir Gilbert mild,</L>
<L>"At FOOTE's, Sir Gilbert, have you seen the child!</L>
<L>"'Tis really a <HI>curosity</HI> to view her:</L>
<L>"Our little Betsy is a mountain to her!</L>
<L>"Such action, such a tongue—and yet I query</L>
<L>"If she be five years old—a very fairy!"</L>
<L>Sir Gilbert answers, with a pevish nod,</L>
<L>"P'shaw! let the little hussy have a rod.</L>
<L>"There are old folks enough to play the fool:</L>
<L>"Children, my lady, shou'd be sent to school."</L>
<L>And so they should, the naughty ones, no doubt,</L>
<L>Who'll neither books nor needle learn without:</L>
<L>But I am come of no such idle breed;</L>
<L>At four years old, I could both write and read;</L>
<L>To be at work my fingers still are itching—</L>
<L>These flowers here are all of my own stitching.</L>
<STAGE>[Taking up and shewing her frock.</STAGE>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="79"/>
<L>But, is my prate disliked, for after all,</L>
<L>I am but young, 'tis true, and somewhat small;</L>
<L>And taller ladies, I must needs confess,</L>
<L>Might speak an epilogue with more address.</L>
<L>However, some few things I have to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ead:</L>
<L>First, 'pon my word and credit, I'm a maid.</L>
<L>Will that pass here for merit?—I don't know—</L>
<L>I'm a new face—which generally does so.</L>
<L>And if you want me louder, taller, bolder,</L>
<L>Have patience—I shall mend, as I g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow older.</L>
