<LG>
<L>WHERE <HI>Hermus'</HI> Waters wash the <HI>Lydian</HI> Strand,</L>
<L>The pow'rful <HI>Craesus</HI> stretch'd his wide Command,</L>
<L>A Warriour King, whose willing Subjects bow'd</L>
<L>To sceptred Worth, superior to the Croud.</L>
<L N="5">Vast was his Wealth, for Conquest swell'd his Store;</L>
<L>Nor what enrich'd the Prince, had left the People poor.</L>
<L>Two Sons he had, alike in outward Mien,</L>
<L>The tender Pledges of a dying Queen.</L>
<L>But speechless one ne'er taught his Sire to melt</L>
<L N="10">With lisping Eloquence by Parents felt;</L>
<L>And mimic Art in vain Expedients sought,</L>
<L>To form the Tongue, and free th' imprison'd Thought.</L>
<L>Yet blooming <HI>Atys</HI> well that Loss supply'd,</L>
<L><HI>Atys</HI> the People's Hope, and Monarch's Pride.</L>
<L N="15">His beauteous Soul thro' every Feature glow'd,</L>
<L>And from his Lips such soft Persuasion flow'd,</L>
<L>As Nature had withheld the Brother's Share,</L>
<L>Only to pour a double Portion there.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>But vain those Graces, since conceal'd from View</L>
<L N="20">They droop in Shades, and wither where they grew.</L>
<L>For one dread Night, as o'er the weary King</L>
<L>The drowsy God had stretch'd his leaden Wing,</L>
<L>He seem'd, he knew not where, in Wars engag'd,</L>
<L>And, whilst around the doubtful Battle rag'd,</L>
<L N="25">Saw from some hostile Hand unerring Part</L>
<L>A fatal Spear, that pierc'd his <HI>Atys'</HI> Heart.</L>
<L>He starts, he wakes,—'Tis Night and Silence all!</L>
<L>Yet, scarce confirm'd, he still beholds him fall;</L>
<L>Still bleeds in Fancy's Eye the gaping Wound,</L>
<L N="30">On Fancy's Ear the dying Groans resound.</L>
<L>Again he sleeps, the same sad Scenes return —</L>
<L>Restless he rolls, and waits the ling'ring Morn.</L>
<L>What can he do, or how prevent a Doom,</L>
<L>Which Heav'n foretels, and Fate has said shall come?</L>
<L N="35">"And yet perhaps the Gods these Dreams inspire,</L>
<L>"To save the guiltless Son, and warn the Sire.</L>
<L>"Too fond of Arms I've wander'd far astray,</L>
<L>"While Youth and blind Ambition led the Way.</L>
<L>"And ravag'd Countries may perhaps demand</L>
<L N="40">"This bleeding Sacrifice for Wrongs sustain'd.</L>
<L>"Then hear me, Gods, propitious, while I swear</L>
<L>"Peace, only Peace, shall be my future Care.</L>
<L>"O wou'd your Powers but save my darling Boy,</L>
<L>"No more this Breast shall glow, this Arm destroy!</L>
<L N="45"><PB N="3" REF="4"/>"Nor e'er shall <HI>Atys</HI> the dire Sport pursue,</L>
<L>"Still in my Court, and seldom from my View,</L>
<L>"In Ease inglorious shall he pass his Days,</L>
<L>"Untaught to feel th' insatiate Lust of Praise.</L>
<L>He spake, and cautious far away remov'd</L>
<L N="50">From <HI>Atys,</HI> what next <HI>Atys</HI> most he lov'd,</L>
<L>The Pomp of War: No Falchions guard the Gate,</L>
<L>And Chiefs unarm'd around his Palace wait.</L>
<L>Nay farther still extends a Parent's Fear,</L>
<L>Ev'n Arms themselves he dreads, and most the Spear;</L>
<L N="55">Nor leaves of ancient Wars the weak Remains,</L>
<L>But strips their Trophies from the mould'ring Fanes,</L>
<L>Lest, fixt too loosely form the faithless Stone</L>
<L>The casual Steel shou'd drop, and pierce his Son.</L>
<L>Thus some sweet Warbler of the feather'd Throng</L>
<L N="60">Deep in the thorny Brake secures her Young;</L>
<L>Yet, vainly anxious, feels a fancied Woe,</L>
<L>And starts at every Breeze that stirs the Bough;</L>
<L>With silent Horror hears the whisp'ring Groves,</L>
<L>And distant Murmurs of the Spring she loves.</L>
<L N="65">Unhappy Sire! but vainly we oppose</L>
<L>Weak human Caution, when the Gods are Foes;</L>
<L>Thy Story's Sequel must too surely prove,</L>
<L>That Dreams, prophetic Dreams, descend from <HI>Jove.</HI></L>
<L>Nor yet shall <HI>Atys</HI> thwart thy fond Designs:</L>
<L N="70">He moves implicit as his Sire inclines.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>On every Look his eager Duty hung,</L>
<L>And read his Wishes, e'er they reach'd his Tongue.</L>
<L>With Smiles he strips his Helmet's plumy Pride,</L>
<L>With Smiles he lays his useless Spear aside;</L>
<L N="75">Nor lets one Sigh confess a latent Care,</L>
<L>Reserving all his Griefs for his <HI>Adrastus'</HI> Ear.</L>
<L><HI>Adrastus</HI> early did his Soul approve,</L>
<L>Brave, virtuous, learn'd, and form'd for <HI>Atys'</HI> Love,</L>
<L>A <HI>Phrygian</HI> Youth, whom Fate condemn'd to roam,</L>
<L N="80">An exil'd Wand'rer from a cruel Home.</L>
<L>For, yet a Boy, his inadvertent Lance</L>
<L>An Infant Brother slew, the Crime of Chance.</L>
<L>In vain he wept, no Expiation knew,</L>
<L>And loaded with a Father's Curse withdrew.</L>
<L N="85">But not in vain the Gods such Ills dispence,</L>
<L>If soft-ey'd Pity takes her Rise from hence,</L>
<L>If hence we learn to feel another's Pain,</L>
<L>And from our own Misfortunes grow humane.</L>
<L>This young <HI>Adrastus</HI> found, and hence confess'd</L>
<L N="90">That mild Benevolence, that warm'd his Breast.</L>
<L>Hence too his Fortune stretch'd a bolder Wing,</L>
<L>And plac'd her Wand'rer near the <HI>Lydian</HI> King.</L>
<L>There long the favour'd Youth exalted shone,</L>
<L>Dear to the Sire, but dearer to the Son.</L>
<L N="95">And pow'rful Sympathy their Hearts had join'd</L>
<L>In stronger Ties, than Gratitude can bind.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>With him did <HI>Atys</HI> every Sport pursue,</L>
<L>That Health demands, and earlier Ages knew.</L>
<L>At Morn, at Eve, at sultry Noon, with him</L>
<L N="100">He rov'd the sunny Lawn, he swam the Stream;</L>
<L>Beside the Brook, that dimpling glides away,</L>
<L>Caught the cool Breeze, and lur'd the finny Prey;</L>
<L>Urg'd the light Car along th' indented Mead,</L>
<L>Or hung impetuous o'er the loose-rein'd Steed,</L>
<L N="105">Beneath whose Hoof unhurt the Flowrets rise,</L>
<L>And the light Grass scarce trembles as he flies.</L>
<L>But chief he lov'd to range the Woods among,</L>
<L>And hear the Music of <HI>Adrastus'</HI> Tongue</L>
<L>With graceful Ease unlock the letter'd Store,</L>
<L N="110">For that he learn'd from him endear'd the Knowledge more.</L>
<L>Of <HI>Thales'</HI> Wisdom oft the Converse ran,</L>
<L>How varying Nature's beauteous Frame began,</L>
<L>And erst to different Forms the Waters flow'd,</L>
<L>As o'er the Chaos mov'd the breathing God.</L>
<L N="115">And how, confirm'd, when some few Years had roll'd,</L>
<L>Expecting Nations did at length behold</L>
<L>Predicted Horrors of a darken'd Sun,</L>
<L>And Spheres that shone with Lustre not their own.</L>
<L>Of <HI>Solon</HI> too he spake, and Laws design'd</L>
<L N="120">To guard fair Freedom, not enslave Mankind—</L>
<L>And hinted oft what mutual Duties spring</L>
<L>'Twixt willing Subjects and their Father King;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>How close connected Greatness was with Pain,</L>
<L>What earthly Bliss, and who the happy Man.</L>
<L N="125">Nor less the while his youthful Breast he warms</L>
<L>With pictur'd Fights, the Theory of Arms;</L>
<L>Lest Honour's Barrier shou'd be quite o'erthrown,</L>
<L>And Virtue weaken'd e'er she mounts the Throne.</L>
<L>Thee, <HI>Homer,</HI> thee with Rapture they peruse,</L>
<L N="130">Expand the Soul, and take in all the Muse;</L>
<L>Mix with thy Gods, with War's whole Ardor burn,</L>
<L>Or melt in silent Tears o'er <HI>Hector</HI>'s Urn.</L>
<L>How oft transported wou'd young <HI>Atys</HI> cry,</L>
<L>"Thus might I fight, 'twere glorious thus to die!</L>
<L N="135">"But why to me are useless Precepts given,</L>
<L>"Tied down and pinion'd by the Will of Heav'n?</L>
<L>"No early Wreaths my coward Youth must claim,</L>
<L>"No just Ambition warm me into Fame,</L>
<L>"Hid from the World to rust in Sloth, and buy</L>
<L N="140">"A poor precarious Life with Infamy.</L>
<L>"Happy, thrice happy, on each hostile Strand</L>
<L>"The Youths that perish'd by my Father's Hand,</L>
<L>"Their Honor still survives, and o'er their Tombs</L>
<L>"Their Country's Tears descend, and Laurel blooms.</L>
<L N="145">"To Life alone the Victor Sword's confin'd, —</L>
<L>"Wou'd you indeed distress, employ a Love too kind.</L>
<L>As oft <HI>Adràstus,</HI> studious to controul</L>
<L>With Reason's Calm the Tumult of the Soul,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>Wou'd hint to what Excess soever wrought,</L>
<L N="150">Paternal Fondness was a venial Fault.</L>
<L>Perhaps, as lenient Time stole gently on,</L>
<L>His Fears might soften, or be quite o'erblown,</L>
<L>And Sun-bright Honour only be delay'd</L>
<L>Awhile to burst more glorious from the Shade.</L>
<L N="155">"Yet think," he cried, "whatever they appear,</L>
<L>"Few are the Causes can excuse a War.</L>
<L>"To raise th' Opprest, to curb th' insulting Proud,</L>
<L>"Or shou'd your injur'd Country call aloud,</L>
<L>"Rush, rush to Arms, 'tis glorious then to dare,</L>
<L N="160">"Delay is Cowardice, and Doubt Despair.</L>
<L>"But let not idler Views your Breast enflame</L>
<L>"Of boundless Kingdoms, and a dreaded Name.</L>
<L>"'Tis yours at Home to stem Oppression's Waves,</L>
<L>"To guard your Subjects, not encrease your Slaves;</L>
<L N="165">"On this just Basis Fame's firm Column raise,</L>
<L>"And be Desert in Arms your second Praise."</L>
<L>'Twas thus in Converse, Day succeeding Day,</L>
<L>They wore unfelt the tedious Hours away,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Atys'</HI> twentieth Year to bloom began,</L>
<L N="170">And the Boy rose insensibly to Man.</L>
<L>What now shall <HI>Croesus</HI> find, what <HI>Syren</HI> Voice,</L>
<L>To make Retirement the Result of Choice?</L>
<L>No Father's stern Command these Years allow,</L>
<L>A Chain more pleasing must detain him now.</L>
<L N="175"><PB N="8" REF="9"/>In rosy Fetters shall the Youth be tied,</L>
<L>And <HI>Mysia</HI>'s Captive Fair the chosen Bride.</L>
<L>Haste, gentle God, whose Chains unite the Globe,</L>
<L>Known by the blazing Torch, and saffron Robe,</L>
<L>To <HI>Lydia</HI> haste, for <HI>Atys</HI> blames your Stay,</L>
<L N="180">Nor fair <HI>Idalia</HI>'s Blushes brook Delay;</L>
<L>O'er Glory's Blaze your soft Enchantments breathe,</L>
<L>And hide the Laurel with the Myrtle Wreath.</L>
<L>And now the King with secret Transport found</L>
<L>His Hopes succeed, nor fears a martial Wound,</L>
<L N="185">While lost in Love the happier <HI>Atys</HI> lies,</L>
<L>The willing Victim of <HI>Idalia</HI>'s Eyes.</L>
<L>O thoughtless Man! from hence thy Sorrows flow,</L>
<L>The Scheme projected to avert the Blow</L>
<L>But makes it sure—for see, from <HI>Mysia</HI>'s Land</L>
<L N="190">Round list'ning <HI>Atys</HI> crouds a suppliant Band.</L>
<L>Their Tears, their Cries, his easy Breast assail,</L>
<L>Fond to redress them e'er he hears their Tale.</L>
<L>"A mighty Boar the Curse of angry Heav'n</L>
<L>"Had from their Homes the wretched Suff'rers driv'n.</L>
<L N="195">"Waste were their viny Groves, their rising Grain,</L>
<L>"Their Herds, their Flocks, th' attendant Shepherds slain,</L>
<L>"And scarce themselves survive.</L>
<L>"O wou'd but <HI>Atys'</HI> lead the hunter Train,</L>
<L>"Again their viny Groves, their waving Grain</L>
<L N="200"><PB N="9" REF="10"/>"Might rise secure, their Herds, their Flocks encrease,</L>
<L>"And fair <HI>Idalia</HI>'s Country rest in Peace."</L>
<L>The Youth assents, th' exulting Crouds retire;</L>
<L>When thus impatient speaks the trembling Sire,</L>
<L>"What means my Son? preserv'd, alas in vain,</L>
<L N="205">"From hostile Squadrons, and the tented Plain,</L>
<L>"To rush on Death—recal your rash Design,</L>
<L>"Mine be the Blame, and be the Danger mine,</L>
<L>"Myself will lead the Band." The Youth return'd,</L>
<L>While his flush'd Cheek with mild Resentment burn'd,</L>
<L N="210">"Will <HI>Croesus</HI> lead the Band, a Hunter now,</L>
<L>"Skill'd in the Fight, and Laurels on his Brow?</L>
<L>"Alas, such Mockeries of War become</L>
<L>"The Loit'rer <HI>Atys</HI> fearful of his Doom.</L>
<L>"To him at least these Triumphs be resign'd,</L>
<L N="215">"That not entirely useless to Mankind</L>
<L>"His Days may pass; These Triumphs all his Aim,</L>
<L>"These humble Triumphs scarce allied to Fame.</L>
<L>"And yet, dread Sir, if you command his Stay,</L>
<L>"(O force of Duty!) <HI>Atys</HI> must obey.</L>
<L N="220">"Alas on you whatever Blame shall fall,</L>
<L>"A Father's Fondness can excuse it all.</L>
<L>"But me, of me, if still your Power withstands,</L>
<L>"What must the <HI>Lydian,</HI> what the <HI>Mysian</HI> Bands,</L>
<L>"What must <HI>Idalia</HI> think?" <HI>Adrastus</HI> here,</L>
<L N="225">Soft interpos'd. "Great King dismiss your Fear,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>"Nor longer <HI>Atys'</HI> first Request oppose;</L>
<L>"War was your Dream, no War this Region knows,</L>
<L>"For humbler Prey the Hunters range the Wood,</L>
<L>"Their Spears fly innocent of human Blood.</L>
<L N="230">"Then fear not them.—Or had the phantom Boar</L>
<L>"Dug deep the Wound, and drank the vital Gore,</L>
<L>"That dreadful Vision had excus'd your Care,</L>
<L>"Nor <HI>Atys</HI> offer'd an unheeded Prayer.</L>
<L>"I love the Prince, and, but I think his Life</L>
<L N="235">"Safe as my own, would urge him from the Strife.</L>
<L>"Permit him, Sir,—this Arm shall guard him there;</L>
<L>"And safely may you trust <HI>Adrastus'</HI> Care,</L>
<L>"For, shou'd he fall, this Arm wou'd surely prove</L>
<L>"My Bosom feels a more than Father's Love."</L>
<L N="240">As, when impetuous thro' th' autumnal Sky</L>
<L>Urg'd by the Winds the Clouds disparting fly,</L>
<L>O'er the broad Wave, or wide extended Mead</L>
<L>Shifts the quick Beam, alternate Light and Shade;</L>
<L>So glanc'd the Monarch's Mind from Thought to Thought,</L>
<L N="245">So in his varying Face the Passions wrought.</L>
<L>Oft on his Son he turn'd a doubtful Eye,</L>
<L>Afraid to grant, nor willing to deny.</L>
<L>Oft rais'd it, tearful, to the blest Abodes,</L>
<L>And sought in vain the unregarding Gods.</L>
<L N="250">Then look'd consent. But added, with a Groan,</L>
<L>"From thee, <HI>Adrastus,</HI> I expect my Son."</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>Why shou'd I tell, impatient for the Fight</L>
<L>How <HI>Atys</HI> chid the ling'ring Hours of Night?</L>
<L>Or how the roseate Morn with early Ray</L>
<L N="255">Streak'd the glad East, and gradual spread the Day,</L>
<L>When forth he issued like the <HI>Lycian</HI> God?</L>
<L>Loose to the Breeze his hov'ring Mantle flow'd,</L>
<L>Wav'd the light Plume above, behind him hung</L>
<L>His rat'ling Quiver, and his Bow unstrung.</L>
<L N="260">He mounts his Steed, the Steed obey'd the Rein,</L>
<L>Arch'd his high Neck, and graceful paw'd the Plain.</L>
<L>E'vn <HI>Croesus'</HI> self forgot a while his Fear</L>
<L>Of future Ills, and gaz'd with Transport there.</L>
<L>Or why relate, when now the Train withdrew,</L>
<L N="265">How fair <HI>Idalia</HI> sigh'd a soft adieu;</L>
<L>How <HI>Croesus</HI> follow'd with his Voice and Eyes,</L>
<L>Fond to behold, but fonder to advise,</L>
<L>And oft repeated, as they journey'd on,</L>
<L>"From thee, <HI>Adrastus,</HI> I expect my Son."</L>
<L N="270">Suffice it us, they leave the Waves that flow</L>
<L>O'er Beds of Gold, and <HI>Tmolus'</HI> fragrant Brow,</L>
<L>They pass <HI>Magnesia</HI>'s Plains, <HI>Caicus'</HI> Stream</L>
<L>The <HI>Mysian</HI> Bound, that chang'd his ancient Name,</L>
<L>And reach <HI>Olympus'</HI> Verge, whose Summit nods</L>
<L N="275">O'er <HI>Phrygian</HI> Fields, nor boasts assembled Gods.</L>
<L>Here Desolation spread her ghastly Reign</L>
<L>O'er trampled Vines, and dissipated Grain,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>And saw with Joy revolving Seasons smile</L>
<L>To swell her Pomp, and mock the Lab'rers Toil.</L>
<L N="280">Led by her baleful Steps the Youth explore</L>
<L>His dark Retreats, and rouse the foaming Boar.</L>
<L>Hard was the Strife: his horny Sides repel</L>
<L>Unting'd the plumy Shaft, and blunted Steel.</L>
<L>The Dogs lie mangled o'er the bleeding Plain,</L>
<L N="285">And many a Steed, and many a Youth was slain.</L>
<L>When now his well-aim'd Bow <HI>Adrastus</HI> drew,</L>
<L>Twang'd the stretch'd String, the feather'd Vengeance flew,</L>
<L>And ras'd the Monster's Neck: he roars, he flies,</L>
<L>The Croud pursues, the Hills resound their Cries.</L>
<L N="290">Full in the Centre of a Vale, embrown'd</L>
<L>With arching Shades, they close the Savage round.</L>
<L>He wheels, he glares, he meditates his Prey</L>
<L>Resolv'd to strike, resolv'd to force his Way;</L>
<L>But <HI>Atys</HI> timely stop'd his fierce Career,</L>
<L N="295">And thro' his Eye-ball sent the whizzing Spear,</L>
<L>And joyful saw him reel; with eager Speed</L>
<L>He bares his shining Blade, he quits his Steed;</L>
<L>"—Ah stop, rash Youth, not Conquest you pursue,</L>
<L>"Death revels there; the wretched Victim you;</L>
<L N="300">"You rush on Fate"—in vain—he reach'd the Beast,</L>
<L>He rais'd his Arm, and now had pierc'd his Breast,</L>
<L>When in that Moment from the adverse Throng</L>
<L>A Heav'n-directed Spear <HI>Adrastus</HI> flung,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>Glanc'd o'er the falling Beast the fated Wood,</L>
<L N="305">And fix'd in <HI>Atys'</HI> Breast drank deep the vital Flood.</L>
<L>The strugling Prince impatient of the Wound</L>
<L>Writh'd on the Spear, the Crouds enclose him round,</L>
<L>Then sunk in Death unknowing whence it came,</L>
<L>Yet, ev'n in Death, he call'd <HI>Adrastus'</HI> Name,</L>
<L N="310">"Where flies <HI>Adrastus</HI> from his dying Friend,</L>
<L>"O bear me near." Poor Prince thy Life must end</L>
<L>Not in thy Murderer's Arms, he hears thee not;</L>
<L>Like some sad Wretch fix'd to the fatal Spot</L>
<L>Where fell the Bolt of Jove, nor Ear, nor Eye,</L>
<L N="315">Nor Arm to help, nor Language to reply,</L>
<L>Nor Thought itself is his. Oblig'd to move</L>
<L>As they direct his Steed, he leaves the Grove,</L>
<L>As they direct to <HI>Sardis'</HI> Towers again</L>
<L>In Silence follows the returning Train.</L>
<L N="320">There too we turn, for there the pensive Sire</L>
<L>Now hopes, now fears, and pines with vain Desire.</L>
<L>In every Dust before the Wind that flies,</L>
<L>In every distant Cloud that stains the Skies</L>
<L>He sees his Son return: till oft deceiv'd</L>
<L N="325">No more his Eye the flattering Scene believ'd.</L>
<L>Yet still he wander'd, and with Looks intent,</L>
<L>The fatal Road his darling <HI>Atys</HI> went.</L>
<L>There to averted Heav'n he tells his Pain,</L>
<L>And slaughter'd Hecatombs decrees in vain.</L>
<L N="330"><PB N="14" REF="15"/>There to <HI>Idalia,</HI> frequent by his Side,</L>
<L>Relates his Fears, or sooths the weeping Bride</L>
<L>With Tales of <HI>Atys'</HI> Worth, and points the Place</L>
<L>Where late he parted from their last Embrace.</L>
<L>And now, perchance, in Tears they linger'd there,</L>
<L N="335">When slowly-moving real Crouds appear.</L>
<L>"What means," he cried, and shot a trembling Eye—</L>
<L>A Youth deputed by the rest drew nigh,</L>
<L>And in sad Accents told the dreadful Tale.—</L>
<L>Rage seiz'd the King; expiring, breathless, pale</L>
<L N="340"><HI>Idalia</HI> sinks, th' attendant Fair convey</L>
<L>With Tears, and Shrieks, the beauteous Load away.</L>
<L>"Where is the Wretch?—hear hospitable Jove!—</L>
<L>"Is this, is this thy more than Father's Love?</L>
<L>"Give me my Son—why stare thy haggard Eyes</L>
<L N="345">"As fix'd in Grief? <HI>here</HI> only Sorrow lyes"—</L>
<L>And smote his Breast, "thy Life in Blood began</L>
<L>"A fated Wretch, a Murd'rer e'er a Man.</L>
<L>"O foolish King! by my Indulgence stole</L>
<L>"This Serpent near me, that has stung my Soul.</L>
<L N="350">"This thy Return for all a King could shower</L>
<L>"Of Bounty o'er thee, Life, and Wealth, and Power—</L>
<L>"But what are those? How great soe'er they be,</L>
<L>"I gave thee more, I gave myself to thee,</L>
<L>"I gave thee <HI>Atys,</HI> link'd in Friendship's Chain—</L>
<L N="355">"O fatal Gift, if thus return'd again!</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>"Reach me a Sword—and yet, dear bleeding Clay,</L>
<L>"Can his, can thousand Lives thy Loss repay?"</L>
<L>Then burst in Tears, "Heav'ns Instrument I blame,</L>
<L>"Tho' by <HI>his</HI> Hand, from Heav'n the Vengeance came.</L>
<L N="360">"This Stroke, O <HI>Solon,</HI> has convinc'd my Pride;</L>
<L>"O had I never liv'd, or earlier died!</L>
<L>"Alas, poor Wretch, why dost thou bare thy Breast,</L>
<L>"And court my Sword? tho' lost himself to Rest,</L>
<L>"This curst of Heav'n, this <HI>Croesus</HI> can forgive</L>
<L N="365">"Th' unhappy Cause, and bids the Murd'rer live."</L>
<L>"Ah stop," he cried," and write the milder Fate</L>
<L>"Here with thy Sword, I only liv'd for that.</L>
<L>"Undone, I thought, beyond Misfortune's Power,</L>
<L>"O do not by Forgiveness curse me more."</L>
<L N="370">While yet he pleaded, to the mourning Croud</L>
<L>Forth rush'd <HI>Idalia</HI> by her Maids pursu'd;</L>
<L>Eager she seem'd, with light Suspicions fill'd,</L>
<L>And on her Face Heart-piercing Madness smil'd.</L>
<L>"Where is my wand'ring Love, ye <HI>Lydians</HI> say,</L>
<L N="375">"Does he indeed along <HI>Meander</HI> stray,</L>
<L>"And rove the <HI>Asian</HI> Plain?—I'll seek him there.—</L>
<L>"Ye <HI>Lydian</HI> Damsels of your Hearts beware,</L>
<L>"Fair is my Love as to the sunny Beam</L>
<L>"The light-spread Plumage on <HI>Cayster</HI>'s Stream,</L>
<L N="380">"His Locks are <HI>Hermus'</HI> Gold, his Cheeks outshine</L>
<L>"The Ivory tinctur'd by your Art divine.—</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>"I see him now, in <HI>Tmolus'</HI> Shade he lies</L>
<L>"On saffron Beds, soft Sleep has seal'd his Eyes.</L>
<L>"His Breath adds Sweetness to the Gale that blows,—</L>
<L N="385">"Tread light, ye Nymphs, I'll steal on his Repose.—</L>
<L>"Alas he bleeds, O Murder, <HI>Atys</HI> bleeds,</L>
<L>"And o'er his Face a dying Paleness spreads!</L>
<L>"Help, Help, <HI>Adrastus,</HI>—can you leave him now,</L>
<L>"In Death neglect him? Once it was not so.</L>
<L N="390">"What, and not weep! a Tear at least is due,</L>
<L>"Unkind <HI>Adrastus,</HI> he'd have wept for you.</L>
<L>"Come then, my Maids, our Tears shall wash the Gore,</L>
<L>"We too will die since <HI>Atys</HI> is no more.</L>
<L>"But first we'll strow with Flowers the hallow'd Ground</L>
<L N="395">"Where lies my Love, and plant the Cypress round;</L>
<L>"Nor let <HI>Adrastus</HI> know, for should he come,</L>
<L>"New Streams of Blood wou'd issue from the Tomb;</L>
<L>"The Flowers wou'd wither at his baleful Tread,</L>
<L>"And at his Touch the sick'ning Cypress fade.</L>
<L N="400">"Come, come—nay do not tear me from his Side,</L>
<L>"Cruel <HI>Adrastus,</HI> am I not his Bride?</L>
<L>"I must,—I will—me wou'd you murder too?"</L>
<L>At this unable to sustain his Woe,</L>
<L>"My Soul can bear no more," <HI>Adrastus</HI> cries,</L>
<L N="405">(His Eyes on Heav'n) "Ye Powers that rule the Skies!</L>
<L>"If your august, unerring, Wills decreed,</L>
<L>"That States, and Kings, and Families must bleed,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>"Why was I singl'd to perform the Part,</L>
<L>"Unsteel'd my Soul, unpetrified my Heart?</L>
<L N="410">"What had I done, a Child, an embrio Man,</L>
<L>"E'er Passions cou'd unfold, or Thought began?</L>
<L>"Yet then condemn'd an infant Wretch I fled,</L>
<L>"Blood on my Hands, and Curses on my Head.</L>
<L>"O had I perish'd so!—but Fortune smil'd</L>
<L N="415">"To make her Frowns more dire.—This vagrant Child</L>
<L>"Became the Friend of Kings, to curse them all,</L>
<L>"And with new Horrors dignify his Fall."</L>
<L>Then eager snatch'd his Sword, "for Murders past</L>
<L>"What have I not endur'd?—be this my last,"</L>
<L N="420">And pierc'd his Breast. "This fated Arm shall pour</L>
<L>"Your Streams of Wrath, and hurl your Bolts no more.</L>
<L>"For Pangs sustain'd Oblivion's all I crave,</L>
<L>"O let my Soul forget them in the Grave!</L>
<L>"Alas, forgive the Wretch your Judgments Doom,</L>
<L N="425">"Dark are your Ways, I wander in the Gloom,</L>
<L>"Nor shou'd perhaps complain.—Be Grief <HI>my</HI> Share</L>
<L>"But, if your Heav'n has Mercy, pour it there,</L>
<L>"On yon heart-broken King, on yon distracted Fair."</L>
<L>He spake, and drew the Steel; the weeping Train</L>
<L N="430">Support him to the Bier, he grasps the Slain,</L>
<L>There feels the last sad Joy his Soul desires,</L>
<L>And on his <HI>Atys'</HI> much-lov'd Breast expires.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>O happy Both, if ought my Muse cou'd shed</L>
<L>Of "Tears eternal that embalm the Dead;"</L>
<L N="435">While round <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Coast old Ocean raves,</L>
<L>And to her Standard roll th' embattled Waves,</L>
<L>Fair Empress of the Deep; so long your Names</L>
<L>Shou'd live lamented by her brightest Dames;</L>
<L>Who oft, at Evening, shou'd with Tears relate</L>
<L N="440">The murder'd Friend, and poor <HI>Idalia</HI>'s Fate;</L>
<L>And oft, enquiring from their Lovers, hear</L>
<L>How <HI>Croesus</HI> mourn'd a twice revolving Year,</L>
<L>Then rous'd at <HI>Cyrus'</HI> Name, and Glory's Charms,</L>
<L>Shook off enervate Grief, and shone again in Arms.</L>
