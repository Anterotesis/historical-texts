<P>THE Subject of this Piece is the same with that proposed the two last Years for SEATON'S Prize Poem, on which Account it was originally written: An accidental Delay it met with upon the Road, occa∣sioned its being presented to the Vice-Chancellor two Days after the Time appointed by the Will of Mr. SEATON; who therefore found himself obliged not to receive it.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st. [51—70]</HI> From Sympathy we rejoice in the pleasures of others, and our affection is conciliated to their author;
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>relation to him heightens that pleasure; consequently its greatest strength is, when that happiness springs from our∣selves, and our own Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>[71—74]</HI> The converse true of Vice.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2d. [75—88]</HI> From Pride. The natural excellencies of the body or mind, when surveyed, necessarily give a species of pleasure which we call self-complacency or pride: this emo∣tion is stronger on the perception of those degrees of perfection, which we give birth to in ourselves, by acts of the will; and is still augmented in proportion of the dignity of the end by which it is put in action; the highest gratification of this instinct is therefore, the contemplation of those of our own actions, to which some virtue was the end.</P>
<P><HI>[89—92]</HI> From Shame. The converse of the former argu∣ment holds good, as vice is attended with the greatest degree of shame.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3d. [93—206]</HI> From Self-love. Self-love actuates our hopes and fears from a consideration of—<HI>1st,</HI> our present, and—<HI>2dly,</HI> our future state.</P>
<P><HI>[93—134]</HI> From the present State.—Those actions which promote the felicity of Society, (or the moral virtues) natu∣rally bring their own rewards with them: Those which obstruct it, (or vices) their respective punishments. Whence according to the nature of our actions, we are filled with
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>the hopes of these rewards, or the fear of these punish∣ments: and as the mind is always more employed in con∣sidering the future, than either the present or the past, these future expectations (which contribute to compose that moral sense, named Conscience) form the greater part of our pre∣sent happiness or misery.</P>
<P><HI>[135—206]</HI> From a future State.—Our hopes are strongly excited by the views of that eternal happiness, our fears by the representation of the divine justice revelation has given us. Digression. Description of the divine justice; her infinity; her almighty power to protect—or punish. She descends upon earth to chastise the sins of men; the effects of her vengeance. The terror a consideration of this must inspire in the breast of the wicked, and more particularly on the point of death.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V. [207—648]</HI> The <HI>FINAL CAUSES</HI> of <HI>CONSCIENCE.—1st,</HI> to excite repentance—<HI>2dly,</HI> to counterpoise the passions—<HI>3dly,</HI> to render the happiness of individuals more propor∣tioned to their moral merits.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st. [213—220]</HI> Conscience excites us by repentance to appease the divine justice.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly. [221—262]</HI> It counterpoizes the passions, by making them subservient to the general good; which otherwise would
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>engage us in excesses the most destructive to society. It introduces the finest moral harmony in the mind; and reconciles all the various pursuits of life to universal happiness.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly. [263—648]</HI> Vice is frequently successful, and virtue deprest in the world: Conscience, by being the secret punish∣ment of the former, and the support of the latter, renders the happiness of each, more proportioned to the moral merit of individuals: and thus forms a necessary supplement to the external administration of providence.</P>
<P><HI>[273—578]</HI> Hence unrestrained Avarice, Ambition, Sen∣suality, and other crimes derive their secret punishment.</P>
<P><HI>[579—610]</HI> And from hence the man of virtue when distrest, experiences a support, enabling him to triumph over or despise the afflictions of life.</P>
<P><HI>[611—648]</HI> While its influence gives new pleasure to all its finer enjoyments, and exalts prosperity into happiness.</P>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN man compares his actions with the rule</L>
<L>Of moral life deduc'd from virtue's school,</L>
<L>With joy their just conformity we see,</L>
<L>And mark with grief where'er they disagree:</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="45"/><NOTE PLACE="foot">(V. 45.) Conscience is defined to be a sense of pleasure or pain; not a bare abstract perception of the mind, exclusive of an operation on the passions: because such a perception must terminate in itself, and can never become a source of action, any more than the abstract deductions of geometry or any other science; and Conscience is an active principle.</NOTE> This MORAL SENSE of PLEASURE and of PAIN,</L>
<L>Of CONSCIENCE forms the wide extended reign.</L>
<L>From THREE great principles by Heav'n imprest,</L>
<L>She holds her empire o'er the human breast,</L>
<L>Mild SYMPATHY, with PRIDE's more ardent sway;<NOTE PLACE="foot">(V. 49.) The term Pride must be understood in a philosophical sense, as a natural pleasure arising from the view of its object; not as opposed to the virtue of humility, in which sense it is a vice. The advan∣tages of life are surveyed with pleasure; the means by which these are procured are therefore pleasing, by the operation of the mind associating the pleasure arising from the contemplation of the end, with the idea of the means: the foremost among these we reckon the natural excellencies of the body or mind: thus 'tis proved, there must exist such a pleasure as self-complacence or pride, from a view of our natural perfections; if nature has not given us an original primary instinct, which makes the natural advantages necessarily and per se give pleasure to their pos∣sessors. Ours is not the only language which wants a term which may express self-complacency, without the danger of being misunderstood without some explanation. Since the writing the above I have happened of the following observation on the word <HI>orgueil,</HI> which one of the best modern French poets wanted to have introduced in the sense I have used the term Pride.—"J'aurois substitué le mot d'orgueil a ces mots, sentiment de nos forces, de nos qualités, &amp;c. mais dans notre langue le mot d'or∣gueil se prend toujours en mauvaise part." Les saisons, note, p. 98.</NOTE></L>
