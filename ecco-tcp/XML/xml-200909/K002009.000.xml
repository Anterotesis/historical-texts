<P>Love in a Village; A COMIC OPERA. As it is performed at the
THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed by W. GRIFFIN; For J. NEWBERY, and W. NICOLL, in
St. Paul's Church-Yard; G. KEARSLY, in Ludgate-Street; T. DAVIES, in
Russel-Street, Covent-Garden; and J. WALTER, at Charing-Cross.

<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>TO MR. BEARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great pleasure I embrace this opportunity to
acknowledge the favours I have received from you. Among others I would mention
in particular the warmth with which you espoused this piece in its
passage to the stage; but that I am afraid it would be thought a
compliment to your good na∣ture, too much at the expence of your
judge∣ment.</P>
<P>If this Opera is considered merely as a piece of Dramatic
writing, it will certainly be found to have very little merit: in that light no
one can think more indifferently of it than I do myself; but I believe I may
venture to assert, on your opinion, that some of the songs are
tollerable; that the music is more pleasing than has hitherto appeared in
any composition of this kind; and the words better adapted, considering the
na∣ture of the airs, which are not common bal∣lads, than could be expected,
supposing any degree of poetry to be preserved in the ver∣sification.
More than this few people expect, in an Opera, and if some of the severer
cri∣tics should be inclined to blame your indul∣gence to one of the first
attempts of a young writer, I am persuaded the Public in ge∣neral <PB REF="3"/> will applaud your endeavour to pro∣vide them with something new, in
a species of entertainment, in which the performers at your Theatre so
eminently excel.</P>
<P>You may perceive Sir, that I yield a punc∣tual observance to the
injunctions you laid upon me, when I threatened you with this address, and
make it rather a preface than a dedication: And yet I must confess I can
hardly reconcile those formalities which ren∣der it indelicate to pay
praises where all the world allows them to be due; nor can I easily
conceive why a man should be so studious to deserve, what he does not
desire: But since you will not allow me to offer any panegy∣ric to you, I
must hasten to bestow one upon myself, and let the public know (which
was my chief design in this intro∣duction) that I have the honor to be,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your most obliged, And most obedient servant, The
AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>And this is your advice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>Positively.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's my hand, positively I'll follow it.—I have
already sent to my gentleman, who is now in the country, to let him know he
may come hither this <PB N="3" REF="8"/> day; we will make use of the
opportunity to settle all preliminaries—And then—But take notice,
when∣ever we decamp, you march off along with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! madam, your servant; I have no incli∣nation to be left
behind, I assure you—But you say you got acquainted with this
spark, while you were with your mother during her last illness at Bath,
so that your father has never seen him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never in his life, my dear; and I am confi∣dent he entertains
not the least suspicion of my having any such connection; my aunt,
indeed, has her doubts and surmises; but, besides that my father will not
allow any one to be wiser than himself, it is an established maxim
between these affectionate relations, never to agree in any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except being absurd; you must allow they sympathize,
perfectly, in that—But now we are on the subject, I desire to know
what I am to do with this wicked old justice of peace? this libidinous father
of yours, he follows me about the house like a tame goat.</P>

<P>Nay, I'll assure you he has been a wag in his time—you
must have a care of yourself.</P>

<P>Wretched me! to fall into such hands, who have been just
forced to run away from my parents to avoid an odious marriage—you

told me; but you must excuse my being a little over-delicate in this

<P>Well, but my dear mad girl—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lucinda, don't talk to me—Was your father to go to London,
meet there by accident with an old fellow as wrong headed as himself; and in
a fit of absurd friendship, agree to marry you to that old fel∣low's son,
whom you had never seen, without consult∣ing your inclinations, or allowing
you a negative, in case he should not prove agreeable—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I should think it a little hard, I con∣fess—yet
when I see you in the character of a cham∣bermaid—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the only character, my dear, in which I could hope to lie
concealed; and I can tell you, I was reduced to the last extremity, when, in
consequence of our old boarding-school friendship, I applied to you to
receive me in this capacity: for we expected the par∣ties the very next
week—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But had not you a message from your in∣tended spouse, to
let you know he was as little inclined to such ill-concerted nuptials as you
were?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than so; he wrote to advise me by all means, to
contrive some method of breaking them off, for he had rather return to his
dear studies at Oxford; and after that, what hopes could I have of being
hap∣py with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are not at all uneasy at the strange rout you
must have occasioned at home? I warrant, during this month that you have
been absent—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! don't mention, it, my dear; I have had so many admirers
since I commenced abigail, that I am quite charmed with my situation—But hold, who stalks yonder into the yard, that the dogs are so glad
to see?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Daddy Hawthorn as I live! He is come to pay my father a visit;
and never more luckily, for he always forces him abroad. By the way, what will
you do with yourself while I step into the house to see after my
trusty messenger Hodge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, I'll sit down in that arbour and lis∣ten to the
singing of the birds: you know I am fond of melancholy amusements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it seems indeed: sure Rossetta none of your admirers
have made a hole in your heart; you are not in love, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>In love! that's pleasant: who do you suppose I should be
in love with pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why let me see—What do you think of Thomas, our
gardiner? there he is at the other end of the walk—He's a very pretty
young man, and the servants say he's always writing verses on you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Indeed Lucinda you are very silly.</P>

<P>Let me see—on the fifteenth of June, at half an hour
past five in the morning 
<STAGE>(having taken out a pocket-book)</STAGE> I left my
father's house unknown to any one, having made free with a coat and jacket of
our gar∣dener's, which fitted me, by way of a disguise:—so says
my pocket-book; and chance directing me to this village, on the 20th of the
same month I pro∣cured a recommendation to the worshipful justice
<HI>Woodcock,</HI> to be the superintendant of his pumpkins and cabbages,
because I would let my father see I chose to run any lengths rather than
submit to what his obsti∣nacy would have forced me, a marriage against my
in∣clination, <PB N="7" REF="12"/> with a woman I never saw. 
<STAGE>(puts up the book, and takes a watering-pot)</STAGE> Here
I have been three weeks, and in that time I am as much altered as if I had

marry her? would I make a mistress of her if I could? Two things, called
prudence and honour, forbid either. What am I pursuing, then? a shadow.

questions; and our old nag at home was so cruelly beat i'th hoofs, that
poor beast, it had not a foot to set to ground; so I was fain to go to
farmer Ploughshares, at the Grainge, to borrow the loan of his bald filly:
and wou'd you think it? after walking all that way,—de'el from me, if the
cross-grain'd tead, did not deny me the favour.</P>

MEADOWS, followed by HAW∣THORN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL this is excellent, this is mighty good, this is mighty
merry faith, ha, ha, ha; was ever the like heard of? that my boy <HI>Tom</HI>
should run away from me, for fear of being forced to marry a girl he never
saw; that she should scamper from her father, for fear of being forced
to marry him; and that they should run into one another's arms this way in
disguise; by mere aocident; against their con∣sents, and without
knowing it as a body may say: may I never do an ill turn master
<HI>Hawthorn,</HI> if it is not one of the oddest adventures
partly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir <HI>William</HI> it is romance, a novel, a pleasanter
history by half, than the loves of <HI>Dorastus</HI> and <HI>Faunia</HI>;
we shall have ballads made of it within these two months, setting forth,
how a young 'squire became a serving man of low degree: and it will be
stuck up with <HI>Margret's</HI> ghost, and the Spanish lady, against
the walls of every cottage in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what pleases me best of all master <HI>Hawthorn,</HI>
is the ingenuity of the girl. May I never do an ill turn, when I was called out
of the room, and the servant said she wanted to speak to me, if I knew
what <PB N="57" REF="62"/> to make on't: but when the little gypsey took me
aside, and told me her name, and how matters stood, I was quite
astonish'd as a body may say; and could not believe it partly; till her
young friend, that she is with here, assu∣red me of the truth on't.
Indeed at last I began to recol∣lect her face, though I have not set eyes
on her before, since she was the height of a full grown greyhound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir <HI>William,</HI> your son as yet knows no∣thing of
what has happen'd, nor of your being come hi∣ther; and if you'll follow my
council, we'll have some sport with him—He and his mistress were
to meet in the garden this evening by appointment, she's gone to dress
herself in all her airs; will you let me direct your proceedings in this
affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart master <HI>Hawthorn,</HI> with all my heart,
do what you will with me, say what you please for me; I am so overjoy'd
and so happy—And may I never do an ill turn, but I am very glad to
see you too, ay, and partly as much pleased at that as any thing else,
for we have been merry together before now, when we were some years younger:
Well and how has the world gone with you master <HI>Hawthorn</HI> since we
saw one another last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, pretty well Sir <HI>William,</HI> I have no reason to
complain; every one has a mixture of four with his sweets; but in the main I
believe I have done in a degree as tollerably as my neighbours.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> I beg pardon for detaining you, but I have
had so much difficulty in adjusting my bor∣rowed plumes.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I never do an ill turn but they fit you to a T, and you look
very well so you do; cockbones how your father will chuckle when he comes to
hear this—Her father master <HI>Hawthorn</HI> is as worthy a man as
lives by bread, and has been almost out of his senses for the loss of
her—But tell me hussey, has not this been all a scheme, a piece of
conjuration between you and my son; faith I am half persuaded it has, it
looks so like hocus pocus as a body may say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour Sir <HI>William</HI> what has happen∣ed has been
the mere effect of chance; I came hither unknown to your son, and he unknown
to me: I ne∣ver in the least suspected that <HI>Thomas</HI> the gardener
was other than his appearance spoke him, and least of all, that he was a
person with whom I had so close a connec∣tion. <PB N="59" REF="64"/> Mr.
<HI>Hawthorn</HI> can testify the astonishment I was in when he first
informed me of it: but I thought it was my duty to come to an immediate
explanation with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not she a neat wench master <HI>Hawthorn</HI>? May I
never do an ill turn but she is—But you little plaguy devil, how came
this love affair between you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have told you the whole truth very ingenuously Sir; since
your son and I have been fellow servants, as I may call it, in this
house, I have had more than reason to suspect he had taken a liking to
me; and I will own with equal frankness, had I not look'd upon him as a
person so much below me, I should have had no objec∣tion to receiving his
courtship.</P>

<P>Well said by the lord Harry, all above board, fair and
open.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ross.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I may be censured by some for this can∣did
declaration; but I love to speak my sentiments, and I assure you Sir

son's good qualities, to a knight of the shire without them.</P>

screen in tent stitch; four counterpanes, in Marsailles quilting; and the

glazed, and hung over the parlour chimney piece, and your grandfather was
