<HEAD>To the Right Honourable <HI>CHARLES</HI> EARL of HALLIFAX,

<SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Obligations I have received from your Lord∣ship for many
Years past, and the Continu∣ance of them to this Time, <PB REF="3"/> do
justly call for a Publick Acknowledgment, on the first Opportunity I had to
make it.</P>
<P>Having nothing of my own worth Presenting to your Lordship, I
have, with your Permission, dedi∣cated some Essays of my Fa∣ther's to
your Lordship's Perusal.</P>
<P>I know how delicate a Taste your Lordship has; that you have
adorned your Mind both with University and Polite Learning; so that were I
not entirely satisfied that the Thoughts in them are not common, (and were
they not my Father's, I <PB REF="4"/> should say) that they are writ in the
smooth Stile of a Courtier, with the Spi∣rit and Air of a Gentleman, and with
the Strength of a Man of Letters, I shou'd not have presum'd to have
inscrib'd your Lordship's Name before them.</P>
<P>How he was qualified to write these Essays, the Pre∣face
mentions; I shall only add, that during the Time of his Foreign Embassy,
which lasted about Thirty Years, he laid out his Hours between Books, Men of
the most polite Parts, and Affairs of the greatest Mo∣ment.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>He had the Pleasure of near twenty Years Retire∣ment
before his Death, (which was at a hundred and one) to recollect his
Observations of Men and Things, and put them in the Dress in which your
Lordship sees them.</P>
<P>There are some of them indeed that seem not to have pass'd
his last Hands, which therefore are not so correct as they would have been,
had he liv'd to have finish'd them. But when I consider, that the first
Draughts of a <HI>Raphael, Titi∣an,</HI> or <HI>Reuben,</HI> are preserved
with great Care, tho' not <PB REF="6"/> finish'd, I thought it best to let
them pass as they are.</P>
<P>The many great Services your Lordship has done the Publick have
been ex∣pressed by so many, that it will be hard to avoid
Re∣petition.</P>
<P>However, for a Noble∣man, at the Head of Af∣fairs at Court, to
move with a great Regard to the Liber∣ty and Property of the Sub∣ject, steady
to the Reform'd Religion in the worst of Times, that advances not Prerogative
beyond its le∣gal Bounds, that has the Good of the Nation at Heart, and that
acts with <PB REF="7"/> great Sincerity, are Virtues that can never be
sufficient∣ly admir'd by all true <HI>En∣glishmen,</HI> and particularly
by,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Think it necessary to give some Account of the Author of
the fol∣lowing Essays, and like∣wise of the Essays themselves; the
rather, because being Posthumous Works, the Genuiness of them might be
otherwise doubted.</P>
<P>As for the Author, Sir <HI>Richard Bulstrode,</HI> he was the
Son of <HI>Edward Bulstrode</HI> of the <HI>Inner-Temple,</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whose Reports are extant; he came abroad into the World
well stock'd with University Learning; was bred at the
<HI>Inner-Temple,</HI> call'd to the Bar, and practis'd as a Barrister, 'till
the Civil Wars breaking out, put a Stop to the Current of the Law; and 
<PB N="ii" REF="9"/> being then a young Man, and of an active Spirit, betook
himself to the Army, and was of the Royal Side; where he behaved himself
so well, that in a little time he was made Adjutant-General to the Army of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the First. After the Return of the Royal Family, he had
a Place at Court; some time after he was appointed to be at the Court of
<HI>Brussels,</HI> as Resident from King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; on
whose Death he was made Envoy by King <HI>James</HI> the Second to the same
Court, his whole Ministry there being about thirty Years; during which Time
he held Correspondence with most of the Courts of <HI>Christendom</HI>
(as I find by his Letters made up into Annals, which I have by me.)</P>
<P>When his Royal Master retir'd to <HI>France,</HI> he went after
him, and sub∣mitted to his Fortune, and lived there in Retirement about
twenty Years; during which Time he had <PB N="iii" REF="10"/> Opportunity to
compose the follow∣ing Essays, which were the Result of his own
Experience.</P>
<P>He had been a diligent Observer of Mankind, through a long
Series of Time, having lived to an Hun∣dred and one; had the Experience of
Courts, the Conversation of Men of the first Quality, Generals, and Men of
Polite Learning: And having had great Variety of Fortune himself, was best
able to inform Mankind what is proper to be done in those several Parts of
Life, in which he had been exercised.</P>
<P>He looked back upon Life, after many Years enjoying it, with a
truer View, than Men usually do forward; for we look through a magnifying
Glass at Things to come, and think them much bigger, and more ex∣cellent than
in Truth we find them. The Prospect of <HI>Canaan</HI> from Mount
<HI>Nebo,</HI> was more ravishing even to <HI>Moses,</HI> than the
Enjoyment of it <PB N="iv" REF="11"/> was afterwards to the
<HI>Israelites,</HI> or would have been to himself. <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> could
not have spoke so feeling∣ly of the Vanity of the Pleasures of this Life,
had he not taken a full Draught of them. The Freedom of the Author's
Conversation, in his younger Years, (being a Man of a warm Temper, a great
deal of Wit and Generosity) having kept what we call the best Company, gave
him an Opportunity of looking back on the Miscarriages, which young Gentlemen
are subject to, with useful Reflections and Remarks, and of speaking more
justly of those Errors, than Closet Moralists usually do.</P>
<P>The Author would have sent me the following Essays, to have
pub∣lished in his Life-Time, had not the War between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France</HI> hinder'd it; but dying before that ended, he gave Directions to
his La∣dy to send them to me by the first <PB N="v" REF="12"/> Opportunity;
which she accordingly did, being all of his own Hand Wri∣ting.</P>
<P>So much for the Author.</P>
<P>As to the Essays themselves:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">I. Essay of Company and
Conver∣sation.</NOTE>That of Company and Conversa∣tion, shews him to have
read Man∣kind very throughly.</P>
<P>The Caution of chusing ones Com∣pany, when to speak, and when
not, when to break a Jest, and when not, is very fit for all young Gentlemen
to know; his short, but smart Re∣flection on obscene Discourses, is a
Proof of his Knowledge of the Go∣vernment of the Tongue.</P>
<P>He Inveighs against the Sin of scoffing at Religion and
profane Swearing, with great Sharpness and a moving Sorrow. When a good Man
hears his Friend traduc'd, he defends him if he has Opportunity, or is in Pain
for want of it: Much more should every Christian be con∣cerned, when he
hears that Name <PB N="vi" REF="13"/> prophaned, which ought not to be mentioned
without Reverence.</P>
<P>Nor does Detraction and Flattery escape a just Censure, tho'
he lived and dy'd in a Court.</P>
<P>His Rules of Conversation, with Superiors, Equals and Inferiors,
are well weighed and consider'd. As most Men are free and open at Meals,
the Account he gives of his Witty Master King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, at
his private Suppers, with some se∣lect Persons, Men of Wit, is very
entertaining.</P>
<P>One General Rule he lays down, that should go through all the
Parts of Conversation, and that is Integri∣ty, which is a Virtue too seldom
pra∣ctised. He avoids the Pedantry and Motoseness of severe
<HI>Cynicks</HI>; and tho' he highly commends pleasant Con∣versation, Wit,
Musick, and diver∣ting Tales; yet he wisely cautions a∣gainst Picquant
Jests, which often breed Quarrels; and in all these <PB N="vii" REF="14"/>
Freedoms, has let nothing slip from him, that is contrary to the Rules of
good <HI>Ethicks.</HI></P>
<P>Mirth thus guarded with Inno∣cence, makes the Cup of Life go down
pleasantly, and leaves no Stain behind it, to wound the Conscience. He has
truly said, that some Persons and Cases are privileg'd from Jests. As
Mens Deformity, Meanness of In∣tellectuals, Poverty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
puts me in Mind of a Gentleman, whose Wit lay only in ridiculing o∣thers; and
having a poor Man that work'd for him, (whose Shape was not deformed) would
be often tell∣ing him he would give him five Pounds to sit for his Picture.
The Man thought 'twas in Derision, would never be brought to it, but gave him
this sharp Answer, <HI>That he would give five Pounds to laugh at a poor
Man, but would not give him a Shilling to buy him a Dinner.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="15"/>Which Gentleman, tho' he had then about two
thousand Pounds a Year, yet afterwards lived to want a Shilling to buy
himself a Dinner.</P>
<P>His Account of Conversation with well chosen Friends is very
delight∣ful and instructive. I know nothing of this World comparable to the
Plea∣sures of Conversation, with wise, ho∣nest and ingenious Friends,
except in the Consciousness of doing our Du∣ty to the most High, and
the Rela∣tions we stand in, and the Peace of Mind, (I had almost said
Rapture) that results from thence.</P>
<P>His Advice to Women, as to their Conversation with Men, is fit
for all Ladies to know; and so it is for Men, that intend Chastity, not to
be too Conversant with pretty Wo∣men; for 'tis ill making Gun-Pow∣der in a
Smith's Shop.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">II. Essay of Solitariness and
Retire∣ment.</NOTE>His Thoughts of Retirement are very philosophical, just,
and of great Weight; and the prudent, and cau∣tionary <PB N="ix" REF="16"/>
Rules he gives therein, of great Use. He writes very feeling∣ly on that
Subject, as what he found by Experience; the Art of Conver∣sation, and the
Art of Retirement, seem to comprehend the whole Scene of humane Life, of both
which he appears to have been a perfect Ma∣ster, and to have given proper
Di∣rections in each State and Condition of Life; he allows the Vigour of Life
to be spent in publick Ser∣vices, and the Remainder in Retire∣ment, and
useful Reflections for the Benefit of Mankind. If he has car∣ry'd Retirement
to greater Heights, than Men attached to the World can allow; it should be
consider'd, that when one is writing on a Pleasure, at a time when one
enjoys it, it's hard to keep within the Bounds of moderate Expressions. His
lofty Strains, nevertheless tho' true, may not appear so to them who
stand at a Distance, and have no Taste there∣of.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="17"/>To speak freely of this Matter, I think
these Rules touching Retire∣ment should be observed.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> To have such a competent Fortune, as may
answer all the Cir∣cumstances of Life, when the Pro∣fits of Employment are
quitted. For to be pinched in the Materials of Life, in old Age, is a
miserable State, especially to a generous Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To have the Mind fur∣nished with such
Knowledge, while the Life was active, as may suffici∣ently employ it, when
contemplative.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To have ones Passions de∣tached from the
World, and to have little or no Thirst after it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> To consecrate the latter Part of Life to the
more intense Ser∣vice of God, in Contemplation and Devotion, and in
Benefactions to the Necessitous; and to endeavour to produce some Fruit,
for the good of the Publick, for the present and fu∣ture Age.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="18"/>More particularly; I think that a Retirement
to a convenient House and pleasant Gardens, near a Church, where daily
Devotions may be had; a good Library, a near Friend, and the Exercise of
Philosophical Experi∣ments, with Beneficence to the Nee∣dy, is the safest
and best Retirement for a wise Man. These Things will fill up the Space
of Life, with Inno∣cence and Pleasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">III. Of St. <HI>Mary Mag∣dalen</HI>'s Life and
Con∣version, with some Reflections on the Con∣version of the good
Thief.</NOTE>As for the Essay of <HI>Mary Magda∣len</HI>'s Life and
Conversion, and of the Conversion of the penitent Thief, he has made many
curious Observations thereon, with very useful Reflections. In the Author's
Discourse on this Subject, he hath rather play'd the Prelate, than the
Gentleman, and having read the Fa∣thers hereon, has been a little taint∣ed with
their Gingle.</P>
<P>He has drawn it out to a Length, with so strong a Fancy and
Inventi∣on, that one would rather have thought <PB N="xii" REF="19"/> to have
been a Man of Thirty than Ninety, when he wrote it. In the winding up however
of that Essay, his Exhortations to the Love of our Sa∣viour, and Contempt
of the World, have great Force and Energy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">IV. Essay of the Life and Con∣version of
St. <HI>Paul.</HI></NOTE>It's a hard Matter for a Man that writes on a Divine
Subject, and who consults what the Fathers have said thereon, not to run
into their Stile, and conform to their way of Ex∣pression. And thus the
Author has done in this, as well as in the pre∣ceding Essay; yet his
Remarks on the <HI>Jewish</HI> Customs, of the Manner of their Education of
their Youth, what <HI>Josephus</HI> says of the sower Di∣sposition of
the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> of which Sect <HI>Paul</HI> was a Member, of his
wonder∣ful Conversion and indefatigable La∣bour in the Ministry, are worthy
of Observation.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the wonderful E∣vent of spreading the Gospel, by
Means so very improbable, and in <PB N="xiii" REF="20"/> humane Appearance
so unlikely, doth manifestly shew the Hand of God assisted
therein.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">V. Essay of Nobility.</NOTE>He has truly
distinguish'd Nobi∣lity into four Parts. The Beginner, Advancer, Continuer,
and Ruiner of Families; and has set forth the Duty of a Nobleman, and the
Grace∣fulness of it, when joined to Virtue, in a very agreeable Manner. The
gaining Honour by Military Perfor∣mances, he holds much preferable to what is
obtain'd by Commerce; when the Soldier and the Scholar meet together, they make
a great General; witness <HI>Zenophon</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> amongst
the Ancients, and Sir <HI>Wal∣ter Raleigh</HI> and General <HI>Stanhope,</HI>
now Secretary of State, amongst the Modern. Yet I cannot but say, that when
that late War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> shall be writ by a
good Hand, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> will shine as bright in our
<HI>English</HI> Annals, as any General either ancient or mo∣dern.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="21"/>The <HI>Scotch</HI> have a good Proverb,
<HI>That an Ounce of Mother's Wit, is better than a Pound of Clergy.</HI> By
Clergy they mean Learning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VI. Essay of Content∣ment.</NOTE>His
Essay of Contentment under adverse Fortune, and the many no∣ble Examples
he brings of great Men in Adversity, and the weighty Reasons he gives for a
quiet Submission to the divine Providence in Afflicti∣on, are so genuine
and natural, that one may easily see they flow from a Mind exercised by
long Trial in that Condition. The afflicted of any sort, may here draw Waters
of Consolati∣on, to give Peace and Rest to their Minds.</P>
<P>His Arguments for Contentment under Afflictions, are very apt to
soften the Passions, and allay the Fury which Men generally exercise
under that State, and reduce the Mind to a wise and sober Resigna∣tion to
the Will of God. He has writ in none of his Essays any thing 
<PB N="xv" REF="22"/> above the Nature of a brave and a good Man, and
particularly on this Subject; he seems rather to have vented the Dictates of
his own Mind, under the various States of Life, through which he had pass'd,
than offer at Conjectures which he never felt. He that sets a Pattern above
humane Life, may please the Fancy, but will never satisfie the Judgment of
the Reader. In giving Rules for the Conduct of humane Life, in the various
Events of it, we should rather write like Divines and Philo∣sophers than
Poets. His Definition of Good and Evil, is more instru∣ctive than that of
<HI>Zeno,</HI> or any of the Stoicks; for he calls that Good which makes a Man
the better, and that Evil which makes one the worse, be that Condition rich
or poor, great or low, easie or painful.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VII. Essay of Women.</NOTE>His
Description of Ladies, shews his Observations of them to be very
accurate; they are beholden to him; <PB N="xvi" REF="23"/> for he has said
very few things of them. I would give them this Cau∣tion, not to be too free
with young Gentlemen, for they who will in∣dulge to the extream Bounds of
Vir∣tue, will easily slip within the Pale of Vice. So thin a Partition,
so easie a Transition there is, between the one and the other. The Flie
that buzzes about the Candle often, ge∣nerally has her Wings burnt at last.
The Person that would avoid burn∣ing of Shins, must sit at some
Di∣stance from the Fire. When Nature is raised by Fooleries, Virtue slips
out of the Room.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VIII. Essay as the Know∣ledge of God, and
against Atheism.</NOTE>His Description of the Vanity of Arts and
Sciences, without the Know∣ledge of God, is a Truth self-evident: For all the
Knowledge of this World is calculated only for the Meridian of this Life, and
reaches no farther; but the Knowledge of God reaches to Eternity. And as
Travellers re∣turning to their own Country, give <PB N="xvii" REF="24"/> a
pleasant Relation of things curious, which they have met with in Foreign
Parts; so the Knowledge we acquire, and Observations we make of God's moral
Government of this World, of the Revolution of States and King∣doms, and of the
natural Production of his admirable Works, may serve us to entertain even
Angels in the Kingdom of Heaven. For tho' An∣gels excel us in Wisdom, Power,
and the Knowledge of some things; yet their Wisdom, Power and Know∣ledge
are circumscribed; for none of these Qualities are infinite but in God;
they are ignorant of some Things: Omniscience is the Attribute only of the
most High: The Re∣demption of Man in its full Latitude, they did not know.
Holy Writ tells us, that Angels were desirous to look into it, and that they
were inform'd of it by the Church. But be that o∣therwise; By the Study and
Know∣ledge of the divine Operations, of God's natural Government of the 
<PB N="xviii" REF="25"/> World, we arrive at the Knowledge of God himself; for
his Majesty is known by his Works, the Contem∣plation of which brings
infinite Plea∣sure to them who delight therein.</P>
<P>As for Atheism, holy Writ tells us, 'twas the Fool <HI>that
said in his Heart there was no God.</HI> And indeed no∣thing but a Fool could
have thought or said so, and he had only the Fol∣ly of saying it in his
Heart, but not the Impudence to express in it Words: Surely as he that sees
a fine House, must conclude an ingenious Artist contrived it, and some
Person must build it; for that Stones and Tim∣ber cannot erect themselves
into a regular Building, without some skil∣ful Builder; so he that looks on
the Frame of this World, must acknow∣ledge an infinite wise God, that made
and governs it: The Belief of which, to a virtuous Man, is a mighty Sup∣port in
the Day of Trouble.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">IX. Essay of Religion.</NOTE>He has set
in a true Light, the Ad∣vantages of Religion, to Communi∣ties 
<PB N="xix" REF="26"/> in general, and to private Per∣sons in particular,
sufficient to recom∣mend it to the Practice of the World. His Complaint of
the Ig∣norance of Christians, with respect to their Religion, and that they
take up their Religion as they do the Fa∣shion of their Cloaths, according to
the Custom of the Country where they live, hath been true, 'till of late
Years, even in this Reform'd Coun∣try; but the Charity Schools that have been
erected and dispersed through all the Parts of this King∣dom, by charitable
Persons, and Books of Instruction given away by them, hath dispelled the
gross Ignorance of the common People, so that now they can give a better
Account of their Religion, than People of a better E∣ducation in Popish
Countries, where the Darkness still continues, and must do so, where
the reading the Bible is deny'd the People, and Ignorance held to be the Mother
of Devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="27"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">X. Essay on Kings and
Princes, and the Educa∣tion of a Prince.</NOTE>His Essay of Princes and
their E∣ducation hath such masterly Stroaks in it, that I could wish, for
the Good of Mankind, that all young Princes would read and consider the
same, and put the excellent Advice therein given, into Practice; the Good and
Peace of the World so much depending on the virtuous and wise
Disposition of the Princes thereof: The mighty Talents which God hath
intrusted them with, will make up a vast Account for them to answer, at
the tremendous Day of Judgment, which they should often think of, and that
would make them better than they generally are.</P>
<P>The Offences they often give, are so great and many, and of so
uni∣versal a Nature, and the Miseries brought on Mankind thereby, so
ge∣neral, that should they read and con∣sider the Woe denounced by our
Sa∣viour against those who give Of∣fence, it would make the stoutest
hearted Prince in Christendom trem∣ble. <PB N="xxi" REF="28"/> Witness that
Prince, who proud∣ly stiles himself <HI>le Grand;</HI> who makes War upon
his Neighbours, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>French</HI> King's Rea∣sons for De∣claring
War against the <HI>Dutch</HI> in 1672.</NOTE>for no o∣ther apparent
Reason, but because he cannot dissemble his Indignation against them
(for pretended and sham Affronts) without Diminution of his own Glory. His
Power to con∣quer was the true Reason, Disrespect the pretended.</P>
<P>That Prince who keeps an Army of three or four hundred thousand
Men in constant Pay, has so many Wolves in Hire, ready to devour Mankind,
when∣ever he lets 'em loose; and has put the rest of Christendom into a
Ne∣cessity of keeping up standing Ar∣mies, to prevent being surpriz'd
and conquer'd by him.</P>
<P>Even in times of Peace, such Ar∣mies corrupt and debauch a whole
Nation; where-ever they come they leave the Stains of Uncleanness be∣hind
them, and infect the Place by the bad Example they give. What hath this Prince
to answer, for so ma∣ny <PB N="xxii" REF="29"/> Millions of Offences, which
the Soldiery of <HI>Europe</HI> have given, origi∣nally flowing from him?</P>
<P>St. <HI>Austin</HI> calls such Princes, the worst of
Homicides, in destroying the Souls of their Subjects.</P>
<P>And our Author tells us, that Kings are not to be esteemed happy
by their Conquests, but by using their Power, in advancing God's Honour and
Service, which will tend to the good of their People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">XI. Essay of Man.</NOTE>Tho' the Author has
set forth the Prones of Man to do Evil, yet he hath told us the Cure is in
our own Power; he meddles not with the Theological Points, whether we can do
Works of our selves, wor∣thy of the divine Acceptance, <HI>ex
Congruitate,</HI> or <HI>ex Condignitate.</HI> He speaks in this Essay
rather like a Mo∣ralist than Divine; yet does very well shew us the Folly
of running the Hazard of an Eternity of Misery, for a few Moments of
sensual Plea∣sure.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="30"/>I am entirely satisfy'd that it is more
easie to mortifie an unlawful Desire by Thought and Considerati∣on,
joined with Addresses for the divine Assistance, than to sate it by
Enjoyment. He that would quench an impure Desire by Enjoyment, is like him
that would throw Gun∣powder into the Fire to extinguish it. Enjoyment stops
the Current for the present, but the next Tide of Blood, fir'd from the
Imagination of the last Enjoyment, makes it boil over into a more impetuous
Torrent. In a Word, Man is the worst or best of Creatures on this side
Heaven.</P>
<P>He that gives way to his sensitive Appetite, and indulges
therein, is worse than a Brute; for Brutes have some natural Checks or
Instinct, that confine and restrain their Sensations within moderate
Bounds; but a <HI>De∣bauchee</HI> lets loose all his five Faculties to an
universal Indulgence, even far∣ther than Nature will afford him Strength. On
the contrary, the <PB N="xxiv" REF="31"/> good Man who makes Reason his Pilot,
and Revelation his Pole Star, sails through the stormy Billows of this
World with Peace and Content∣ment, and having <HI>Mens consciarecti,</HI>
does in a manner anticipate the Joys of Heaven, by fixing his Treasure there
before hand, and by a strong Imagination of what is to come, tastes them in
this present Life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">XII. Essay of Greatness of
Mind.</NOTE>There are abundance of Examples, both ancient and modern of great
Men that have sacrificed their Lives for the good of their Country. <HI>Dulce
est per Patria mori,</HI> is an old Adage. Fame and the Hope of immortal
Glory have carry'd Men on to very desperate Attempts, and Things that at
first View have seemed impra∣cticable to the Cautious and wary, have
nevertheless by bold and reso∣lute Men been carry'd with Success.</P>
<P>He that sets no Value on his own Life, hath generally the Life
of any <PB N="xxv" REF="32"/> other Man in his Power. But I think true
Greatness of Mind rather con∣sists in conquering one's self, than the
World; <HI>Fortior est qui se, quam qui fortissima Vincit.</HI></P>
<P>A Man of a wild-fire Spirit, may roam about the World, with a
Parcel of Soldiers at his Heels, and burn and consume half the Univers, which
in the modern Language, we call a Man of Valour, great General, invincible,
al∣ways victorious, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet be the worst of Men, the worst
of Friends; and all the while he is doing of Mischief, may be gratifying a
wicked Passion; may wish with the Tyrant, that all Mankind had but one
Neck, that he might cut it off at one Blow. But he that considers the State
and Con∣dition of Life he is placed in here, that he hath a Body that hath
Ap∣petites and Desires, strong and vigo∣rous towards sensual Objects,
and to enjoy them in a prohibited De∣gree; and that he hath a rational Na∣ture,
that should steer and govern <PB N="xxvi" REF="33"/> his sensitive
Faculties, and bring them to act within Bounds; that there is a reveal'd divine
Law, that commands him to lead a holy Life; on which Considerations, he
sacrifices the De∣sires of the Body to the Divine Pre∣cepts, and suffers
Afflictions with Re∣signation to that Hand from whence they come; this Man,
in my Opinion, is greater than <HI>Caesar</HI> or <HI>Pompey; Job</HI> had
more passive Valour than <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> the Great. But we have
<HI>Ro∣man</HI> Examples of meer Heathens, that refus'd the Riches and Honours
of the World, and retired to an obscure and private Life; witness
<HI>Quintus Cin∣cinnatus,</HI> who was ploughing at his little Farm, when the
Senate of <HI>Rome</HI> sent to him to come and appease the Sedition in the
City; which when he had so done, he return'd back to his Farm again, and
would accept no Reward. Soon after he was sent to again, to head the
<HI>Romans</HI> against a foreign Enemy that invaded their Country; he went,
and was made <PB N="xxvii" REF="34"/> Dictator, beat the Enemy, rescued his
Country, laid down the <HI>Fasces,</HI> re∣fus'd the Lands and Treasure
offer'd him for his good Services, being con∣tented with the Reward only which
Virtue brings with it, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Pleasure of a good Conscience,
which results from doing one's Duty, and return'd back to his petty Farm.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">XIII. Essay of Children.</NOTE>We take a
great deal of Care in our Breed of Horses; and some are so curious to do
the like in their Dogs; while at the same time there is an universal
Negligence in the Choice of Wives; the greatness of the Portion being the
chief Thing aimed at; whereas a good Under∣standing should be principally
desired: A silly Woman, especially if she be of a low and mean Spirit,
generally bringing foolish or sheepish Children. There is no less
Carelessness in the E∣ducation of Children in their tender Years. What
People attend them. Foolish Nurses, and weak Women being generally the
first Persons they <PB N="xxviii" REF="35"/> converse with, after they are
able to talk. What Idle Impressions, and sil∣ly Ideas must such
Children have, that are thus accosted, as soon as their Fa∣culties are able
to receive any Impressi∣on. The idle Tales of such Women, who frighten
Children from crying by Stories of Hob-Goblins, Spirits, and such Fooleries,
have made them, when of an adult Age, afraid of being in the Dark, and of
something, they know not what. They teach them Pride, and to value
themselves upon their Cloaths, by asking and shewing them where they are
fine, which Folly accompanies the Female Sex usually to their Grave; nor are
foppish Men free from that Vanity.</P>
<P>They teach them Revenge and Folly at the same time, by
pretending to beat another by a Blow or Pat from the Hand of the Child.</P>
<P>They teach them lying and Folly, by telling Miss, 'twas not
she that cry'd, but one behind the Curtain. Thus taught, comes the abused
Infant on the Stage of the World; whereas the most di∣screet 
<PB N="xxix" REF="36"/> and prudent People should be at∣tendant on Children,
to make proper Impressions upon them at first, for these stick
longest with them; as for the more riper Years, the Author hath spoke so
fully that I shall add no more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">XIV. Essay of Law.</NOTE>The Benefit of
Laws and living by Rules, are so evident to every Under∣standing, that
there needs but little to be said in Commendation thereof.</P>
<P>There is scarce any Nation under Heaven, however despotick and
abso∣lute the Prince is, but yet has some cer∣tain Rule or Law for the
general Con∣duct of humane Life, with respect to the Publick; yet when the
Prince is absolute, the Subject is little better than a Slave, Law being but
a Cobweb to him, which he can easily break thro', when-ever he pleases.
That the People conform their Lives after the Example of the Prince, and chief
Magistrate where they reside, the Author hath ve∣ry justly observed,
which ought to be a Lesson to all Princes and Magistrates, to act with
great Caution, that their bad <PB N="xxx" REF="37"/> Example may not lead the
common People, or those of a common Under∣standing, into Vices. <HI>Regis
ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</HI> And here I can∣not but say a Word of
the Benefit of our <HI>English</HI> Laws, which both Foreigners that live
here, and Natives, have great Reason to be thankful to Providence for. The
Laws of <HI>England</HI> secure every Man's Property and Liberty, no Man
forfeits either, but by the Transgression of some known positive Law.
The Magistrate cannot commit any Sub∣ject to Prison, without a Breach of
the Laws; if he does, he is answerable for it to the Party injured. The Judge
de∣termines not according to Arbitrary Power, but according to known and
stated Rules. But this Subject hath been so much spoken of, that I think
it not necessary to say any more thereon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">XV. Essay of old Age.</NOTE>As no Man
writes more feelingly of Afflictions, than he who gives his Thoughts a Vent
under that Conditi∣on; so no Man can write so truly of the Circumstances
of old Age, as he <PB N="xxxi" REF="38"/> that keeps his Understanding well to
an hundred, the which the Author did, as appears by his Essays, some of
which were writ at near that Age.</P>
<P>The Respect he challenges, as due to old Age especially, when
furnish'd with Wisdom and Knowledge; and the Consideration of good
Services done to the Publick, is a Tribute, that I think ought not to be deny'd
it. But nothing can make the Mind of an old Man more calm and sedate, more
bright and shining, than a Retrospect of a long Life well spent, in a
zealous promoting the Honour of God, and the Good and Welfare of Mankind; for
every Man's Life is to be estimated by its Usefulness. Integrity of Mind,
a love of Truth in the Soul, and the Consciousness of do∣ing all we can,
for our most munificent Benefactor, to whom we are riding post in old Age,
makes that Scene of Life full of Joy and Pleasure. St. <HI>Paul</HI> was full
of Rapture, when he was going off the Stage of Life, tho' by a violent Death.
But few Courtiers come within <PB N="xxxii" REF="39"/> this Character; for to
them generally Falshood and Deceit are as natural, as bowing and cringing;
and as for Truth, it hath no Place in their Souls. They join themselves to a
Party, that they may mount up to be the Head of it, with no other View, but to
betray and destroy it, and to aggrandize themselves thereby. Oh!
blessed Sincerity, oh hap∣py Integrity! But this wicked State of Life is as
ancient as <HI>Seneca</HI> the Trage∣dian, witness these Lines, 
<Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN God created <HI>Adam,</HI> who the first Moment was a
perfect Man, yet he was not made to be entirely de∣tached, and to live
inde∣pendant of his Kind; for tho' he had nothing in Prospect but Plenty,
Pleasure, Innocence, and Secu∣rity, and by the Dignity of his Nature was
set above the Society of meer Ani∣mals, yet God saw his Being imperfect
without a Helper, and that his Happi∣ness <PB N="2" REF="41"/> was not
compleat whilst he remain'd Solitary; wherefore God miraculously reliev'd
him, by dividing him, to unite him, and made one Part of him a Com∣panion for
the other, to maintain his Reason with a more equal Converse; for which End
God ordain'd Speech, from whence we derive all the Advan∣tages of Society, and
without which Men would have been useless to each other. For by this we
possess the most valuable worldly Blessings, Friendship and
Society, which are esteem'd amongst the Pleasures of the first
Magnitude, the Comfort of Life depending upon Con∣versation, Humane Society
being like the working of a Arch-Stone, where all would fall to the Ground if
one Peice did not sustain another; and yet Com∣pany is so dangerous, and
Speech so lia∣ble to be deprav'd, that what was inten∣ded for our Advantage
is become the Source of all our Misfortunes. For Ori∣ginal Sin came first out
of the Mouth by Speaking, before it entred hers by Eat∣ing, and therefore the
due Management of that Member may justly be reputed one of the greatest
Mysteries of Wisdom and Virtue, since we find to our Sorrow, the first
Use <HI>Eve</HI> made of her Tongue was to talk with the Tempter, and from 
<PB N="3" REF="42"/> that Discourse to tempt <HI>Adam,</HI> who was no
sooner fallen, but he makes a frivo∣lous Excuse less able to cover his
Sin than the Fig-Leaves his Nakedness; And this Viciousness of the Tongue
hath de∣scended from the Infancy of the World even to this Day, for amongst
our great∣est Depravations there are none more Notorious than that of Speech;
For we do not only fall by the Slipperiness of our Tongues, but we
deliberately train them to Mischief, and what was first intended for the
Benefit of Humane Society, is now become the great Disturber of it, we living
in an Age wherein we count it a part of our Birth-right to let loose our
Tongues, and to use the Spur where we should hold the Bridle; whereby
Conversation is generally Corrupted, and he that Converses has almost as
ma∣ny Snares as Companions, there being scarce any single Man, but by his
Dis∣course, Example, or Behaviour, does recommend to us, or imprint in us,
or by a kind of Contagion insensibly infect us with some Vice or other;
so that Conversation, which was intended to cultivate our Minds and
civilize the World, hath turn'd it almost to a Wil∣derness. Upon this
Account some Men will take a Pett at Mankind, and walk <PB N="4" REF="43"/>
into the Desarts to avoid Company, when it is more prudential to stand
their Ground, and to fence against the In∣conveniencies that may happen; and
if they fear bad Company they should keep close to Men of Virtue, and
stand care∣fully upon their Guard; it being more reasonable to be
conversable for the sake of the Good, than to fly from every Mortal for
fear of meeting with bad People: If every Man were possest with this
Shiness, not only States and King∣doms, but even Humane Nature would be
destroy'd; for to what end was Speech given to Man, if it were not for
Enter∣tainment of each other? And must we quit our Station, and turn Savage
by our selves, and suffer no Company, for fear of Bad? This is to take
Things by the wrong Handle, for nothing but our own Miscarriages ought to
affect us, and not those of other People.</P>
<P>'Tis certain that all Mens Bodies are naturally of the same Clay,
the difference of Education only is the Pot∣ter's Hand that forms them into
Ves∣sels of Honour or Dishonour; there being no humane Means more
effectual towards ripening and sharpning Mens Intellects, giving them an edge
and quickness for Conversation, than good <PB N="5" REF="44"/> Education,
because it takes them in that Age wherein their Faculties are, as their
Joints, pliable and tractable, and so capable of being by Exercise
impro∣ved into great Degrees of Strength, Activity and Ability: So that one of
the greatest Blessings which Man can receive at God's Hands, is the
favoura∣ble Blessing of good Education, which polishes and purifies
Nature as one would do a precious Stone wholly defiled with Earth; and this
makes Men become like Angels, when without it the best Na∣tures would still
dwell in Brutishness. Now since after good Education, it is a great Part
of Wisdom as well as Breed∣ing, to learn what is convenient, and to take the
true height of our Acquain∣tance, who conversing with our Minds, cast upon
them either Graces or Defor∣mities; It will therefore be highly ne∣cessary
for young Gentlemen, who are tender of their Honour and Credit, to be more than
ordinarily careful of being too venturous of any Company, and to be very
curious in taking an exact Survey with what Persons they may safely and
decently Converse, and how they ought to Behave themselves therein.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="45"/>It is usual with Physicians, in infectious
Times, to forbid most strictly the smal∣ler Excesses and Exorbitances
of Diet, as apt to breed any Distemper, because every small Accident of
that Kind (thro' the Malignity of the Air) is then likely to turn into the
Plague: So now that Atheism and Profaneness are rife in the World, and
spread much, and Debau∣chery is so predominant and contagious, that we
daily see many Men of virtuous Dispositions and good Inclinations, (which
would have grown to Abilities) to be by ill Company most perniciously
Corrupted; some Cautions herein seem therefore highly necessary: For as
if we Breath in an infectious Air we shall suck in Diseases, so if we
live in bad Company we shall soon add to their Number, and learn their
Vices and Im∣perfections.</P>
<P>There is nothing more dangerous for young Gentlemen than to
mistake them∣selves in the Choice of their Company: This is a Point of
such Importance, that upon it depends the whole Course of their Lives and
Manners; the frequen∣ting with wicked Men brings us acquain∣ted with Vice,
makes us behold it with∣out Emotion, by Degrees we begin to act it with some
Pleasure, and Time breeds in us a Habit.</P>
<Q><PB N="7" REF="46"/> 
<L>Principiis obsta serò Medicina paratur,</L> 
<L>Cum mala per longas invaluere moras.</L></Q>
<P>St. <HI>Augustin</HI> well expresses the Danger of this,
saying, 
<Q REND="inline">"It is a Nail driven in∣to a Post with a Hammer,
which after the first and second Stroak may be drawn out with little
Difficulty, but being once driven up to the Head, the Pincers can take no hold
to draw it out, which cannot be done but by Destruction of the Wood.</Q></P>
<P>He that lives in this great Theatre of the World, should in the
first Place learn how to suit himself into sundry Habits, that he may
be inabled in this Comedy to represent many Persons, no Man be∣ing fit to
appear upon this Stage till he knows how to Act his Part to the Life; and
therefore he must labour to have his Mind made pliable, which may stoop and
rise according to the several Con∣ditions and Capacities of Men he
asso∣ciates with, not fearing to speak to the Greatest with due
Observance, nor dis∣daining to converse familiarly with the Meanest,
respecting Goodness where∣ever he sees it, which he shall as often find
under a Russet Coat as under a <PB N="8" REF="47"/> Velvet Cassock, and
with Moral honest Men as soon as with the more Learned; for Conversation
hath made very accom∣plish'd Persons without the Assistance of
Learning, the World being a great Book which instructs continually,
Conversa∣tions are living Libraries, not at all in∣ferior to Books; Good
Conferences are like Flints, which from a cold and dark Heap produce Heat and
Light, if Men strike them one against the other; and the familiar
Discourses of two or three good Wits may be more advan∣tageous to us than
the empty Dispu∣tations of many Pedants together, and they vent more in one
Hour than we shall read all Day in a Library.</P>
<P>There is nothing that puts better Thoughts in a Man than a good
Com∣panion; for Example hath the force of Precept, and touches the Heart with
an Affection to Goodness; and not only the frequent hearing, but the very
seeing of a Wise Man delights us.</P>
<P>The best Rule herein is to associate with those who may be
the better for us, and we for them; these Respects are mutual; for while we
teach we learn: It is not Safe to trust our selves with much Company;
whosoever goes much abroad, he scarce comes home the same 
<PB N="9" REF="48"/> Man he went out, something or other discomposes him;
for it is with our Minds, as it is after a long Indisposition with our
Bodies, we are grown so ten∣der that the least Breath of Air exposes us
to a Relapse.</P>
<P>There is certainly much Pleasure and Satisfaction in communicating
our Thoughts, and in the Intercourses of Friendship well chosen; and
therefore <HI>Seneca</HI> said, <HI>If Knowledge and Wisdom were offered
him, on the Terms of a Se∣cret, and that he must not speak of it, he would
positively refuse the Present.</HI> And <HI>Tully</HI> in his
<HI>Offices</HI> tells us, <HI>If a Person had all the Blessings of this
Life, yet if he was kept from all Company, and ne∣ver to see or converse
with Men, he had much rather Die, than Live in such Con∣dition.</HI></P>
<P>Now the first Step to Conversation is our outward Carriage and
Comport∣ment, wherein the less we are constrain'd, our Actions and Thoughts
seem there∣by more Innocent: The Differences of Men are easily read in
their Behaviour, and a short Observation of that will often tell us as much
as a long Confe∣rence. Some Mens Carriage is like a Verse, where every
Syllable is measur'd; but where there is so much Care about the 
<PB N="10" REF="49"/> Outside, there is commonly a Remisness in what
belongs to the Mind; it being as rare to see starched complimental Man
Wise, as to see a Woman Valiant. There is a sort of Men who have an
earnest Application to make every thing sit right about them, which
strikes too deep into their small Stock of Thoughts to allow it Furniture
for any thing else, and therefore to do right to these fine∣spun
Gentlemen, Conversation is too course a Thing for them, and it's best to
leave them to their Taylor, with whom they will live in better
Cor∣respondence than with any other Com∣pany. Indeed, a good Presence and
handsome Mein, sorted with Valour and Wisdom, does a Man excellent
Service, (if he spoils it not with Affe∣ctation) and carries with it (as
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> us'd to say) <HI>Letters or Re∣commendation</HI>;
and if I am rightly in∣form'd, this was the only Thing that brought the great
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> into Favour with King <HI>James</HI> I. by
see∣ing him at a Masque in Court. Cer∣tainly, if our outward Comportment be
good, the adorning the Mind does dou∣ble that Excellency; if ill, it will make
it good, when the Mind performs what the Body promises not. Our Behaviour 
<PB N="11" REF="50"/> should be like a well-made Suit of Cloaths, more proper
than gaudy, more fit than fine. In our outward Carriage, all manner of
Affectation is unseemly, there being nothing more becoming a Gentleman than a
native Freedom there∣in, a Gracefulness of Behaviour setting off much when
it is not constrain'd. Dancing is good, and adds Grace to a Man, when he well
performs it; but a Man must not set himself to it as if he made it his
Trade. Dancing makes the Body free, and not so stiff but to move
gracefully; and a Man's Skill is therein perceiv'd tho' he stands still:
But who∣ever intends to make it his Master-peice, one may call it excelling
in a Mistake, which is <HI>no good Commendation,</HI> as a late great Lord
said. It is a great Advan∣tage to be a good Actor; for Action is a kind of
Expression, and Words well chosen are agreeable, when they express
Things that please; so all that is ex∣pressed by the Face and Body is
well re∣ceiv'd when done with a good Grace. But we must not here mistake:
For there are those that are sometimes Actors of Nothing, as well as
those that are Speakers of Nothing: The Action and Air of the Countenance
have certain Charms, which have a great Influence <PB N="12" REF="51"/> on our
Minds: An Oration spoken by a good Orator appears great and lofty, tho'
penn'd in common Terms, and compounded of ordinary Conceptions; and many
Preachers have in their Pul∣pits charm'd their Auditors, whose Ser∣mons in
Print were scarce worth Read∣ing: I have heard Verses recited in a good
Tone, which have been admir'd, which being read by another, their Esteem was
much diminish'd; and it's probable the Reason of this Alteration proceeded
from the Harmony which was then wanting: We should not look upon this as
strange of good Orations, and agreeable Conferences, if we call to mind that
of Musical Instruments, touch∣ed by the Hands of an exquisite Master;
there are some Tones which inspire Sad∣ness, and sweetly incline our
Souls to Languish; and there are Airs which Re∣joyce and make our Hearts
Merry, and pleasingly compel our Feet to Dance their Time.</P>
<P>In Conversation, it is not enough to have Wit, but he must be an
extream well-bred Man to know how to be plea∣sant in Conversation,
amongst Persons that know how to Judge; because most Men have not a
delicate Taste, nor are able to discern what is best; and it often 
<PB N="13" REF="52"/> happens that such Persons are taken, nay even charm'd
with certain ridiculous Parts they play to them; but tho' these Fooleries are
current amongst some, yet well-bred Persons do not love such kind of
Buffoonry, and those that use them are rather the Subjects of Scorn than
Laugh∣ter, to those that rightly understand: Such are half-witted Men, who
have a tinsel Wit, which shines amongst those who cannot Judge, Petty
Merchants of small Conceits, who have an empty Ha∣bit of Prating without
Meaning, they always aim at Wit, but generally make false Fire</P>
<P>'Tis true, we cannot shew too much Wit in pleasant
Conversation; yet a Man must have a great Care not to shew himself too
forward, as if one would appear ready to make Jests and speak fine Things:
There is something of a free way, which cannot be well expressed, which
hath a much better Effect; but yet it is not good to be too Reserv'd, nor
affect Singularity; an open and com∣plaisant Carriage hath very great Charms
to attract Love: However, what Ad∣vantage soever any one hath, he must be
pleas'd with others, if he would have others pleas'd with him: And if we like
not our Company, let us withdraw from <PB N="14" REF="53"/> them; but whilst
we are in Company, we should carry our selves so, that we should be
acceptable to those with whom we Converse, tho' we have no Kindness for
them. As for those who think to Revenge themselves by a cross Carriage,
they do themselves more Injury than they do to others. The Love of Socie∣ty
is Natural, but the Choice of our Company is Matter of Prudence, and the
Conscience of giving good Example is one of the greatest Obligations any
Man can lay upon the Age he lives in.</P>
<P>It is indeed a fair Step towards Hap∣piness and Virtue, to delight
in the Conversation of good and wise Men, and where those cannot be had,
it is best to keep no Company at all. When Men are Good and Virtuous, they
are as good alone as in Company, but most Men are of themselves the worst
Com∣pany they can keep; let such therefore Converse with others, and avoid
them∣selves; but he that cannot secure him∣self in Privacy, shall be
much more ex∣pos'd in Publick. Many a Ship is lost in the Harbour, but more
in the Ocean. There are some Persons whose Compa∣ny we cannot too much
frequent; 'tis certain, by seeing them often, besides the Improvement we
have by being with <PB N="15" REF="54"/> them, we gain a good Esteem to our
selves, as we Perfume our selves un∣awares by walking amongst the
Jessamins and Orange Trees. Witty Men, who are well-bred, always say
something that pleases, and seldom do any thing which hath not some
Mark of Worth and Breeding; and by conversing with and observing them, we
may not only in∣form our selves of such Things as are necessary to be
known for the making an accomplish'd Man, but we also learn how to apply
them, and likewise so far as to know when 'tis proper and man∣nerly to be
Silent: But we must know how to distinguish, for we shall often hear
very good Things come from Men, who behave themselves with as much
Becomingness as can be disired; yet many times this is but borrow'd
Lan∣guage, and the Actings of a Part, and therefore we must not regard so
much that which appears Polite and Regular, as we do certain other Things,
which shew whether there be a Foundation, and that the Understanding goes
farther, and is of larger Extent.</P>
<P>We find in some Men a certain Plau∣sibleness of Carriage,
which pleases in young People, but yet passes away like a Flower or a
Dream, and we shall often <PB N="16" REF="55"/> see these Men become the
Neglect and Scorn of those who once admir'd them; but a well-bred Man hath
more solid Virtues, tho' he be less busie and for∣ward to shew
himself in the World; and if we love a Man for his good Breeding and
Honesty we shall always love him. Yet it is not enough to have a fair
Out∣side to make a Man agreeable; that which is of greatest Importance, is
the Will regulating our Intellectuals, and taking Care that our Head and our
Heart be in good Order; for no Man can ever be Excellent without having a good
Heart and much Wit.</P>
<P>An accomplish'd Person, tho' of ne∣ver so much Wit, ought not
to be too Confident of himself; for the more he Excels, the more Care he
ought to take not to Prescribe to the Company; for naturally every Man is
afraid of a Master Wit, and Men do not love to be he∣ctor'd out of their
Opinions, it being esteem'd the common Birth-right of Mankind, that every Man
to opine and judge according to the Dictates of his own Understanding, and
not of another's; and therefore a Magisterialness in Opi∣nion is very
unbefitting Men in Conver∣sation, for it does not only fasten upon our
Nature, but upon the better Part of <PB N="17" REF="56"/> it, our Reason:
Freedom is the endea∣ring Thing in Society, and where that is controlled, Men
are not very fond of Associating themselves. 'Tis Natural for us to be
uneasie in the Presence of those that assume an Authority over us; as
Children care not for the Company of their Parents or Tutors that govern them.
And Men will care less for theirs, who would make them Children by usurping
a Tutorage over them. This Perem∣ptoriness in Conversation renders Wise
Men disobliging and very troublesome, and Fools ridiculous and
contemptible, we seeing none so peremptory as half∣witted People, who have
just enough to excite their Pride, but not so much as to cure their
Ignorance: This is the Effect of a mean and imprudent Educa∣tion; a Man who
hath converst only with the lower Sort of Company, who durst not dispute
nor examine his Asser∣tions, thinks the same false Coin will pass
over the World, which went cur∣rant amongst his Petty Comerades; And we may
observe this Fault is most usual amongst young Men, who have come raw
into Company with good Fortunes and ill Breeding. And there∣fore those
Persons are most to be esteem∣ed, who shew their Wit without offen∣ding
<PB N="18" REF="57"/> any one; and such are usually ha∣ted, who make use
of Wit only to the displeasing of others; and a Wise Man ought to avoid
the Company of such, it being a small Advantage to have Wit, if we do not
make use of it for gaining the good Opinion and Love of the World. We ought
to deal with others, with that Patience, Respect, and Mo∣deration, which we
expect from them, not setting forth our own Opinions im∣periously, nor
rejecting the Opinion of others arrogantly, remembring that we are all
enwrapped in a deep Mist, and that all our Reasoning is but groping in the
Dark; and therefore we should pass gently over the Errors of our
Neigh∣bours, to oblige them to the like Ac∣count: But many Gentlemen are so
far from this generous Humour, that they always behave themselves
disdainfully in Company, as if they could not set a just Value upon
themselves without the ut∣just Contempt of others. But this Pride is
commonly a Wind that blows only one Way, down Hill upon those below him,
upwards they breath gentler Gales, it being one of their most studied
Fa∣culties, to perform all Acts of the high∣est super-errogating Civility
to those above them; Now there is nothing that <PB N="19" REF="58"/> makes a
Man more distasteful to Com∣pany, than this haughty Humour, it being not
only Pride but Inhumanity, to attribute so much to the Prerogative of Birth,
as not to shew Affability and Respect to the Meanest.</P>
<P>The Conversation of those who are bred in Armies is not commonly
very pleasing, but in Recompence, they are said to be Men of Honour and
Repu∣tation, as if that would excuse their Wants in every Thing else, when
there is nothing so disgusting as to be dis∣agreeable and morose in
Company. This is like certain Women, that pretend to Virtue, who value
themselves much up∣on their being Coy and Fierce, which makes Men think all
is counterfeit and affected, and that they are easier gotten, than those
who observe good Manners and Breeding, and are as Affable as these are
Severe. Such Women are like those peevish Mistresses, who think they
have a Licence to Kick and Scratch, provided they do not Kiss, as if Ladies
could not be honest without being rude. A con∣fident yet a modest Carriage,
which is neither mean nor sullen, having nothing which savours not of
Goodness and Ho∣nesty, is that which is most esteem'd in the World, and
takes with every Body: <PB N="20" REF="59"/> Women who have most Wit, like
best a discreet Reservedness in Men, those being usually
disappointed of their Aims, who throw, as it were, their Hearts at Ladies
Heads, and at the first Dash tell them more of their Love, than can in any
probability be true, and many times more than they desire to hear.</P>
<P>In our Conversation, it is good Ad∣vice to spare and thriftily
to order that which a Man knows, and tho' he hath that in his Head which is
better than Silence, yet he ought to be more wil∣ling to hear, than to speak,
to learn, than to teach; it being a great Folly to be more ready to shew all
that is in us, rather than to learn Knowledge of ano∣ther, to spend our own
Stock, rather than to get new. When we hear we receive, when we speak we
give, and tho' it be more glorious to give, yet it is more profitable to
receive; and there∣fore a just Moderation herein is best, not to be
over-Silent nor Talkative, the first shewing Stupidity or Scorn, the last
Giddiness of the Brain: Prudent Men will therefore speak no more than to
bring on Discourse, and will give others their turns of Speech; a Civil
Guest will no more Talk all, than Eat all the Feast. It is a great
Advantage to know <PB N="21" REF="60"/> how to Speak and to Write; when either
smells too much of Study it pleases not; the general Opinion is, that Men
should Write as they Speak, and Speak as they Write; but we seldom do
either, as we wish we could: In order to this, it were good when we Write to
imagine we are Speaking, that we may not put in any Thing that is not Natural,
or which may not be spoken in Company; and when we Speak, we should fancy
we are Writing, that we may not say any Thing that is not fitting: Many
People are said to Speak well who cannot Write well, but I doubt there is a
Mistake herein, for some Men may seem to Speak well in Appearance, when
they do not in Effect: For when a Man really excels in Speak∣ing, he may do the
same in Writing; but this latter requires more Care, and one may Write well,
without knowing how to Speak well, for we usually see those who make it
their Business to Write well, have commonly a languish∣ing Way of
Speaking; for to Speak well, is not only to make our Thoughts be understood,
but to express our Ap∣prehensions, which are two very diffe∣rent Things;
and there is no greater sign that a Man well understands him∣self, than
to be able perspicuously to <PB N="22" REF="61"/> Speak to the
Understanding of another; and our Discourse should always be measur'd
by the Aptness of it to whom it is Addressed; for unless our Speech be
fitted to the Capacities of those we Dis∣course with, tho' it be never
so elabo∣rate, it will rather Confound than Edi∣fie.</P>
<P>Thus, the best Art of Speaking shews it self under a natural
Dress; it is like plain natural Beauty, those that are the most Perfect
shew themselves least, and when our Words smell of Art and Study, one
may conclude, they that say them have but little of either, or else that
they know not how to make use of them. This is the Fault of those that
Speak so, that they cannot be under∣stood but by the Learned: We should
therefore to our Power rather mean Wisely, than speak Learnedly, much
less Affectedly; for those whose Tongues run Proud after Words, are of
very lit∣tle Use, but amongst such Ears as call a Bag-Pipe Musick, for
their Lips open like a Purse without Money, and their Tongues like a Fencer
before a Pageant, stir, but not strike. A Gentleman should talk like a
Gentleman, that is, like a Wise Man; his Knowledge ought to be general, he
should have a Taste of every <PB N="23" REF="62"/> Thing, he should not be
a Slave to one Science, one Knowledge is but Part of the House, like a bay
Window, no Man will build his House so maim'd, much less himself, he
must be Com∣pleat.</P>
<P>All those who have given Rules for Civil Life, have, in order to
it, put very severe Restrictions upon the Tongue, that it run not before
the Judgment. 'Twas <HI>Zeno</HI>'s Advice to Dip the Tongue in the Mind before
one should Speak; and <HI>Theophrastus</HI> was us'd to say, It was
safer trusting to an unbridled Horse, than to intemperate Speech; and
daily Experience confirms this Aphorism, for those who set no Guard upon
their Tongues are hurried by them into a thousand Indecencies, and very often
into real considerable Mischiefs; and whereas Men should keep a Lock upon
their Lips, they give their Tongue the Key of their Heart, and the Event hath
been often as Unhappy, as the Proceeding was Preposterous.</P>
<P>And as our Words must be the Pro∣duct of our Judgment, so they
must be temperate and decent, mixed with Cur∣tesie and Civility; for he
that hath calm∣ed his Passions, hath nothing to betray them to rash and
rude Language, which <PB N="24" REF="63"/> is a Foam cast up only by the
Billows of a turbulent Mind, and can never be the Issues of a serene
composed Tem∣per; neither does any thing Charm us more than gracious
Language, <HI>Quae ne illos quidem quos damnat offendit</HI>; a pregnant
Example of which was seen in the last Age, at the Tryal of the Earl of
<HI>Strafford,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> in the Year 1642.
where, amongst others that were appointed by the House of Commons to Manage
their Impeach∣ment against him, there was one emi∣nent Lawyer, who urged very
smartly against his Lordship, but yet with great Respect and Civility
of Language; And when the Earl came to Reply, as he did to every one, he said
he had been very roughly handled by most of the Plea∣ders; but that he was
very much be∣holding to one civil Gentleman amongst them, (naming the former
Person) who, tho' he had touched him nearer the Quick than any other, yet he
was ob∣liged to return him Thanks, because he had cut his Throat with a clean
Knife: Thus we see good Words are afforded at the same Price as ill, and
are not on∣ly cheap, but prevalent upon all Occa∣sions.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="64"/>Next to this Graciousness of Lan∣guage, we
should be very careful that our Speeches carry Integrity with them, Candour
and Ingenuity being most e∣steem'd in Discourse: Those who have
upright Hearts, their Judgment (how small soever) will be still the
same, but those who have many Turnings and Doubles in their Heart, never
have a right Understanding, there is always some counterfeit Light, which
gives them false Appearances, and then their Artifices and Craft shew they
have not Parts sufficient to effect their Designs by fair and honest
Ways; whereas the way that pleases worthy Persons, is that Freedom of
Plain-Dealing. What a Gracefulness so clear a Source gives to all the
Actions of our Life? How it beautifies our Words and Thoughts? And how
pleasing a Thing it is to Speak well, when so much Sincerity goes a∣long
with it? And tho' one may not perhaps be Happy in all Things by following this
Maxim; however, one is sure at least to gain the Esteem and Af∣fection of
those who understand true Merit, nothing being so commendable in
Conversation as to have an upright and sincere Heart, which seems to be
the Foundation of Wisdom.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="65"/>Speech was given to Man as the Image and
Interpreter of the Soul: It is <HI>anime index &amp; speculum,</HI> the
Messen∣ger of the Heart, the Gate by which all that is within issues
forth, and comes into open Veiw: And therefore the Philosopher said well to
the Child, <HI>Lo∣quere ut te videam,</HI> Speak that I may see thee, that is
the Inside of thee; for as Vessels are known whether they be broken or
whole by their inward Sound; so is Man from his Speech, which car∣ries with
it not only a great Influence, but a great Discovery of our Minds; and
Integrity herein is the publick Faith of Mankind. With all sorts of Men we
should deal ingeniously yet reser∣vedly, saying what we think, but
think∣ing more than we say, it being not good to say at all Times all that
the Heart think∣eth, tho' all that the Heart thinketh be good. Freedom of
Speech is some∣times to be foreborn, least we give others Power thereby to
lay hold on the Rudder of our Minds; for in all there are some Places weaker
than others, and prudent Men will take heed of ly∣ing uncover'd that Way: 'Tis
true there may be possibly in Discourse a Fault of Omission; but
this is a right-hand Error; a Man may be sometimes sorry he said 
<PB N="27" REF="66"/> no more, but very often that he said so much: God hath
given us two Ears and one Mouth, that we ought to Hear more than to Speak; we
have no Ear-Lids to keep us from Hear∣ing, and often must Hear against our
Will; but our Mouth shuts naturally, and we may keep our Tongue from
Speaking, unless by Intemperance we lose that Privilege of Nature.</P>
<P>The Truth is, our Tongue is so slip∣pery that is easily
deceives a heedless Guard, Nature hath given it some un∣happy Advantages
towards it, it being the most ready for Motion of any Mem∣ber, and therefore
is to be the more carefully managed; the chiefest Rules to be prescribed
herein, are Sufficiency and Pertinency, a Man should not only know what to
say, but what not to say, for in Speech enough is better than all; Words
are but the Lacquies of Reason, of which to send more than will per∣form
the Business is superfluous, and the Discretion in Speaking, is not
so much in Speaking few Words, as in Speaking none Impertinent; otherwise
the Dumb were Born with great Ad∣vantage, if we must retrench the Use of
the Tongue, instead of moderating it.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="67"/>A wise Man's Words must be weigh∣ty and
material; they are <HI>weighed in the Balance,</HI> says the Son of
<HI>Syrach</HI>; and therefore a Gentleman's Discourse should be such
as might answer that Character, no Man ever attempting to put Froth and
Bubbles into the Scales.</P>
<P>When <HI>Zeno</HI> heard a young Man full of Talk, <HI>Aures inquit
in linguam de∣fluxêre,</HI> he said, His Ears were fallen into his
Tongue; intimating thereby, that they should Hear much and Speak little: The
Truth is, when People are very young, they cannot Judge rightly of any Thing;
and it happens either by Experience, Reflections, or meeting with some
intelligent Persons, they come to be of another Mind, and de∣spise that
which they once so much ad∣mir'd, and many Times laugh at them∣selves, when
they examine themselves without Flattery. It is certain, he that always Talks
adventures himself too far, thereby depriving himself of Observa∣tion,
which is the great Advantage of Society, and from whence comes Expe∣rience and
Wisdom: Herein we should imitate cunning Shopkeepers, who shew their
Wares in a half Light, upon Oc∣casion we should Speak but sparingly, and
rather Starve than Surfeit our Au∣ditors. <PB N="29" REF="68"/> Our
Discourses must not be too florid in the beginning; it is a Thing much to
be wished, that all which one says be good and fine, according as the
Subject merits; but we must proceed by Degrees; Nature is in this, as in all
other Things, a very knowing Mistress; con∣sider how She proceeds
insensibly, the fairest Day when it begins to break and appear, hath so
little Light, that it is hardly discernable whether it be Day or Night; and
nothing is so great a sign that the way of Speaking is noble, as when it
leaves some certain Things to be apprehended without Speaking them; and
therefore it is good to know when to give over, and to proceed to other
Matters, or at least we should give them another Face and Turn, because
Diver∣versity seems not tedious.</P>
<P>To make our selves be heard with Pleasure, we must say
such Things as others will be glad to hear, and say them pleasantly,
which is the best way to make us be belov'd; besides, when we please
others well, we are likewise better pleas'd with our selves. Excellent
Painters ne∣ver draw all, they still allow something for you to exercise
your own Imagina∣tion, and always leave you more to find out than they
discover; The Graces ap∣pear <PB N="30" REF="69"/> very rarely, and even when
they are seen, they will not be consider'd full fac'd nor uncover'd; in the
same manner we should not open our selves too much; and in our
Discourses we should observe this as a general Rule, Either to Speak
fitly, or to be Silent wisely; for many by their Silence may pass for
Wise Men, whom Speech would presently discover otherwise. When the
Ass disguised himself in the Lyon's Skin, he frighted all the Beasts,
and even the cunning Fox, till he heard him Bray. <HI>Pro certo scias nisi
rudentem audivissem &amp; te ego timuessem:</HI> Unlearned Men, which
seem of Ability to Strangers, are quickly discover'd by their Loquacity,
and those that speak much in Company seldom speak well, for they that
well understand themselves know not how to dwell in Talk. <HI>Long
Discourses,</HI> says <HI>Plutarch, like over-feather'd Arrows, shoot
beyond the Mark, and by wearying the Attention, ordinarily lose both Game and
Labour. Aristotle</HI> answer'd a Man well, who having held him in a long
Discourse, in the end begg'd his Excuse, telling him he might have
sav'd his Apo∣logy, for he had not minded what he said. And it was a
smart Reply of <HI>Theo∣critus</HI> to an ill Poet, repeating many of 
<PB N="31" REF="70"/> his Verses, and asking which he liked best,
answer'd, <HI>Those which he had omit∣ted:</HI> And indeed, the Company of
such who Talk much to little Purpose, ought as little to be regarded; for
if a Man be vain and trifling in his Dis∣courses, both he that hears, and
he that answers, will be equal Losers of their Time. And if we shut our
Ears to tri∣fling Discourses, much more carefully ought we to keep our
Hearts from drawing in the Breath of obscene Dis∣courses, which are the
very Pest of Con∣versation. We should herein imitate <HI>Xenocrates</HI>
the Philosopher, who being asked an obscene Question, and giving no
answer, being again importun'd to Answer, said well; <HI>De tali re te
homi∣nem vanum interrogare decet, me autem respondere nequaquam:</HI>
Obscene Speeches, like Oil falling upon Linnen, will spread much; and as
the Poison of the Body enters by the Mouth, so the Poison of the Heart
enters by the Ear; and there∣fore those who have Honesty in their Hearts,
will have only civil and modest Words in their Mouths.</P>
<P>Next to Modesty in our Conversation, we must be careful not to
be too inqui∣sitive into other Men's Affairs; and if we would be persuaded
to affect a <PB N="32" REF="71"/> wholsom Ignorance therein, it would much
conduce to our Ease and Inno∣cence; for it is the Itch of the Ear that breaks
out at the Tongue, and were not Curiosity the Purveyor, this Trade would
soon be set aside. The Boy in <HI>Plutarch</HI> being ask'd what he
carried hid under his Cloak, answer'd well, <HI>That he there∣fore carried it
so, that the other might not know it.</HI> An unseasonable Inquiry into
Things shews a great Weakness and Folly in the Inquiror.</P>
<P>When <HI>Socrates</HI> was asked by a curi∣ous Person, What was
done in the next World; he told him, <HI>He had never been there, nor spoken
with any that came from thence.</HI> St. <HI>Augustin</HI> tells us,
<HI>Cu∣riosus est qui ea avidè scrutatur quae ad se non
pertinent, studiosus vero qui dili∣genter ea perquirit, quae ad se
attinent.</HI></P>
<P>We shall see some Men very inquisi∣tive into the Religion of
their Acquain∣tance, being very shy of discoursing with Men of differing
Persuasions, and put on an angry Zeal against them, be∣lieving they are
fighting God Almighty's Quarrel, and therefore grow into a hardned Severity
against all who dis∣sent from them; And we shall frequent∣ly see Men,
whose Manners and Con∣ditions are very conformable in all the 
<PB N="33" REF="72"/> necessary Obligations of Human Socie∣ty, to avoid each
others Company, and grow unsociable to each other, meerly because the one
cannot think as the other does: Whereas our Opinions come from our Heads, our
Affections from our Hearts; and therefore a wise Man will no more trouble
himself about his Companions Religion, than about the Religion of his
Physician or Lawyer: The Offices of Friendship which one Man owes to
another, having nothing to do with that Consideration; and Men do not so
much question, whether their Servants be Virtuous, as whether they be
Diligent, which is the Thing for which they make use of them. But yet this is
a pernicious Error, for Men to think themselves no otherwise concer∣ned in
their Servants, than they are in their Horses and Oxen, to look upon them
only as another Species of work∣ing Cattle; and, so they do their
Busi∣ness, care not how arrant Brutes they be: Whereas Gentlemen should
con∣sider, that they with themselves are com∣mon Servants to one great
Master; and that the Subjection of one to the other, is but the wise
Oeconomy of their Lord, who hath made the one as Stewards or Supervisors to
regulate the rest, and <PB N="34" REF="73"/> then it will appear a great
Unfaithful∣ness to neglect this Charge; for tho' they receive Wages, they are
not below their Care, Nature having made no such Di∣stinction, and Returns
of Kindness and good Usage are as much their Due to such of them as
deserve it, as their Ser∣vice is due to their Masters when they require it.
But leaving this Digression, there are others so far from this
Nice∣ness, that in their Discourses they de∣spise and mock at
Religion, because they would not be under the Restraints of it; Religion is
against them, and therefore they set themselves against Re∣ligion; and
it is observable, that those who upon other Subjects their best Friends
must needs acknowledge to be sufficiently dull, yet can talk very wit∣tily
in derogation of Religion, with some kind of salt and smartness; and
because Religion frets them, it makes them wynch and fling, and gives them
some kind of Wit and Sharpness in rallying against it. These are
Persons that ne∣ver say any Thing well, but what is ill to say; and
therefore we must be very careful to distinguish between what ex∣acts the
Title of Wit from our Judg∣ments, and that which appears but such to our
Corruptions: This prophane Li∣berty <PB N="35" REF="74"/> is too much us'd in
our Nation, and hath crossed those Seas which en∣viron <HI>England,</HI>
which is not so happily sever'd from the World's Vices, as from its
Continent: But I wonder how such Men should have the Fortune to be
e∣steemed Wits, only for Jesting out of the common Road, and for making
bold to scoff at those Things, which ought to be reverenced of all Mankind;
But we are fallen into such a prophane and sceptical an Age, as takes a
Pleasure and Pride in unravelling almost all the received Principles of
Religion.</P>
<P>However, we must not think the worse of Religion, because
some Men are so bold as to despise and deride it; for it is no
Disparagement for any Per∣son or Thing to be Laughed at, but to deserve
to be so; there being nothing so excellent but a Man may find Ways to
traduce it, and therefore we ought not to have the less Reverence for the
Principles of Religion, because idle and prophane Persons can break Jests
upon them, for a little Wit with a great deal of ill Nature will easily
furnish a Man for Satyre; there being nothing so Sa∣cred, which by the
petulancy of Wit, may not be made ridiculous; and those Buffoons which do
so, spare neither <PB N="36" REF="75"/> their Souls nor Reputation to shew
their Abilities, by prophane more than inge∣nious Sallies: But it were happy if
Men would use a nobler Exercise for their Wits, than to persist in
their scoffing Humour, which is not only an Enemy to Religion, but to every
Thing else that is worthy; and yet we shall see some Men so prophane,
as to make use of Scripture Phrases to give a relish to their most
insipid Discourses; and were it not for this Magazine, a great many Men's
Raillery would want Supplies, and they would be very Mute without this Topick.
In our Conversation, we should carefully avoid the customary Sin of
Swearing, which hath none of those Allurements which other Sins have; such
Men play the Platonick to Damnation; and the great wonder is, that we see
none who own God more in their Oaths, than those that dis-own him in their
Lives; a great Absurdity of Wicked∣ness, to have a God to Swear by, none to
Believe in, none to Pray to. There is indeed such a Deluge of Impiety and
Prophaness at this Day overflowing our afflicted Nation, that it hath brought
down most terrible Judgments upon it: Wickedness is now become the Mode and
Fashion amongst them; so that Men <PB N="37" REF="76"/> there begin now to
fear the Singularity of being Innocent; and a Man may with less Scorn appear
there in the an∣tiquated Habit of our Forefathers, than to own the obsolete
and condemned Qualities of true Piety, Loyalty, Duty and Sobriety; And what
Temptation is it to the Vulgar to be Wicked, when their Superiors have beaten
the Path before them: When Gentlemen are Atheistical, Clowns will think
them∣selves very modestly Wicked if they be but Prophane; and when they
hear their Betters swear, they will soon find they are as well qualified
for that part of Greatness as the best. It were very happy for our Nation,
if those Seducers of the People would sound a Retreat to their mis-led
Followers, and would teach them Religion, Obedience, and Submission, as
they have formerly led them to Impiety and Disobedience.</P>
<P>But to return to our intended Dis∣course; Gentlemen in their
Conversa∣tion ought never to reveal Secrets. Our Eyes, Tongues and Looks, are
the Win∣dows and Doors of our Hearts, we should therefore be cautious to keep
every thing from breaking out, which may be safelier hid than revealed. The
Wits of futilous Persons are like the <PB N="38" REF="77"/> Vessels of the
<HI>Danaides,</HI> that emptied as fast as they fill'd; that which comes in
at the Ear, goes presently out at the Mouth, because Indiscretion, which
di∣rects to hearken, as lightly as to Speak, lets fly out, as easily as lets
in, and dis∣perses as soon as collects. These pub∣lish what they
know, only that they may be telling of News, an itch where∣with their Tongues
are strangely over∣run, who can as well hold a glowing Coal in their Mouths,
as keep any thing Secret which they think new, which is a most childish
Vanity, and Men must have Souls of a very low level, that can think this a
fit Entertainment: These Men not having usually Depth enough to supply
themselves out of their own Store, can therefore let nothing pass by them,
no more than a Mill, which is always going, cannot afford any Water to run
waste. Now these Men are more Impertinent, and not less Injurious than
the most Malicious; <HI>Anacreon,</HI> who was choaked with a Grape-stone,
died as surely as <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> with his Three and twenty Wounds;
and a Man's Re∣putation is as soon fool'd and prated a∣way, as maliciously
Betray'd, nay per∣haps more easily; for where the Speaker can least be
suspected of Design, the <PB N="39" REF="78"/> Hearer is the apter to give
him Cre∣dit; and this way of insinuating, is like those Poisons taken in
at the Pores, which are most insensibly sucked in, and the most
difficult to expel. These Men are so perpetually Busie, and con∣tinually
employ'd in finding Faults with others, that they cannot look towards
themselves; and whilst they put false Dresses and Varnishes to hide
their own Deformity, they cannot allow the least Imperfection of another's to
remain un∣detected. If these Men would look in∣to their own Hearts, they
would find such work for their Inquisitions and Censure, that they
should not be at leisure to Ramble abroad for it: Now such as Busie
themselves with Tales of their Neighbours, and entertain Com∣pany with them,
furnish their Wits, as young Girls do their Closets, with Shells and
Gew-Gaws; and since they bestow their Time so ill, they should Study
the Anatomy of Flies; and to punish their Bodies as well as their Minds, they
should live only upon Shrimps, where∣in there is more Business than Meat:
It is indeed a gross Error to think (so we speak in Truth) we may declare
any Mans Faults, for we must as well speak in Charity as Truth, and yet
many Men <PB N="40" REF="79"/> will slide easily into Detraction, think∣ing
it no great Matter, not considering the smallest Sins are the Devils
greatest Stratagems; and if <HI>Satan</HI> fetter us, it is indifferent to
him, whether it be by a Cable, or by a Hair: St. <HI>Augustin</HI> therefore,
who was sensible of the com∣monness of this Vice, had this follow∣ing
Distick written over his Table. 
<Q> 
<L>Quisquis amat dictis absentum rodere vitam,</L> 
<L>Hanc mensam vetitam noverit esse sibi.</L></Q> The Truth
is, we should never in our Discourses make absent Persons the Subject
of our Mirth; those Freedoms which we use to a Man's Face, are com∣monly
more moderate and equitable, because we expose our selves to the like
from him; but Backblows are disinge∣nious, shewing we intend not a fair
Tryal of Wit, but a cowardly Murther of a Man's Fame: But some Men think
their Wits to be a-sleep, if they dart not out something that is piquant,
and pier∣ceth to the Quick, but this Vein ought to be bridled. 
<Q>Parce puer stimulis, &amp; fortius utere loris.</Q> 
<PB N="41" REF="80"/> There is great difference between Salt∣ness and
Bitterness, and no Weapon cuts so deep as a reproachful Word, neither is
any Wound longer in curing; And those Jeers are most resented which touch
a Man's Reputation, chiefly that of Wit and Discretion, of which even Fools
seem wary, and few will confess their Ignorance: The Reproaches of Wit are
like the Corrodings of <HI>Aqua fortis,</HI> they ingrave and indent
Chara∣cters that can never be defaced; a dull Reproach quickly vanishes, no
Person thinking it worth remembring, but when 'tis steel'd with Wit, it
pierceth deep, leaving such Impressions in the Fancies of the Hearers,
that it sometimes hap∣pens to survive both Speaker and Hearer, and carries
it self to Posterity: Many a poor Man's Infirmities had been confin'd
within a narrow Compass, had not some picquant strain of Drollery
scatter'd and disperst them; And therefore those who rejoyce in Point
of Reflection upon each other, that love to disparage and backbite their
Fellow-Creatures, and gratifie their proud and haughty Hu∣mour in Derision of
others, should read those excellent Verses, which to this Purpose St.
<HI>Prosper</HI> gives us in this fol∣lowing Epigram: 
<Q><PB N="42" REF="81"/> 
<L>Culpare in quoquam quae non sunt nota, malignum est,</L> 
<L>Praesertim quae sunt cognita, si bona sunt.</L> 
<L>Non pateant faciles saevis rumoribus aures,</L> 
<L>Quae nescire juvat credere non libeat</L> 
<L>Linquantur secreta Deo, qui si quid opertum est</L> 
<L>Inspicit, &amp; nullis indiget indiciis.</L></Q></P>
<P>Defamation is certainly one of the most unkind Designs that one
Man can have upon another, every Man being naturally tender of his Reputation,
which yields a Perfume even after Death, and a Man's Reputation can hardly be
tossed without receiving some Bruise; the hea∣vy Scandals under which
some Men have lain, having taken their Rise only from some Inadvertence
or Indiscretion; and even doubtful Accusations leave a Stain behind them,
and often prove indelible Injuries to the Party accused: And as in the Case
of Stealing, it is Proverbially said, <HI>If there were no Receivers, there
would be no Thieves</HI>; so in this of Slan∣der, if there were fewer
Spreaders, there would be fewer Forgers of Libels, the Manufacture would be
discouraged, if it had not these Retailers to put off the Wares. A Man may
sometimes do Things which to God and his own Con∣science are abominable,
and yet keep <PB N="43" REF="82"/> his Reputation with Men, but when his
secret Crimes are detected, then he becomes infamous; so that tho' his own
Sin be the material Cause, yet the Dis∣covery is the formal Cause of his
Infa∣my; and he that hath divulg'd his Fault stands accountable for all the
Conse∣quences that flow from that divulg∣ing.</P>
<P>Some Men are maliciously apt to run down the Reputation of any
that stand in their way either of Pleasure or Pre∣ferment: When
<HI>Joseph</HI>'s Chastity had changed the Scene of <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s
Wife's Passion, she presently fixes the Crime upon him: So when
<HI>Ziba</HI> had a Mind to undermine <HI>Mephiboseth</HI> in his Estate,
he first practises upon his Fame in a false Accusation: And how often
have we seen in our Time these Scenes re∣acted; and tho' many Men have been
Wicked enough to commit this Crime, yet none have been so Impudent as to avow
it; all Crimes have had their Abettors, only this Sort of impudent and lying
Slander is so much the Dregs and Refuse of wicked Men, that none have yet
had Chymistry enough to Sub∣limate it, and to bring it into such a
Re∣putation, that any Man would think fit to own it, till our last infamous
Age of <PB N="44" REF="83"/> insulting Vice, where this Wickedness has not
only been admitted into Pra∣ctice, but appears also bare-faced, which did
always before keep on the Vizard; for no Man had ever the Confidence before to
own himself a false Accuser of his Brethren, till that most wicked Age,
which hath not only permitted, but encouraged and rewarded Men for being
false Accusers, to the eternal Re∣proach of our Nation, and of them that
suffered it.</P>
<P>Next to avoiding the Conversation of these foremention'd, we
should be cau∣tious of Conversing with such who Censure and Judge
severely of other Men's Actions, which is one of the highest Violations of
Charity; and a good Man will never make severe Con∣structions, but set
every Thing in the fairest Light, and put upon it the most candid
Interpretation that the Matter will bear, which is of great Importance to the
Reputation of our Neighbour: For he that gives the first ill Character of a
Man, fixes the Stamp, which ever after goes currant in the World, it being the
Business of many to lay on more Load, but of few to take it off; for most
People lessen their own Beam into a Moat, and magnifie their Neighbour's 
<PB N="45" REF="84"/> Moat into a Beam: They turn the re∣verse End of the
Perspective to represent their own Faults small and at a distance, and
shuffle the other End to their Neighbour, to make theirs seem great. Now
such as make bitter Invectives a∣gainst other Men's Faults, and indulge and
palliate their own, shew their Zeal lies in their Spleen, and consider not
so much what is done, as who does it. A Man that affects an extraordinary
Splendor of Reputation, is glad to find any Foiles to set him off, and will
there∣fore let no Fault nor Folly of another enjoy the Shade, but bring it into
open Light, that by such Comparison his own Excellencies may appear the
brigh∣ter; But this shews a degenerous Spi∣rit, and because he wants
solid Worth, on which to bottom his Reputation, he is feign to found it on
the Ruins of other Mens. Diamonds sparkle in the Sun-shine, 'tis but a
Glow-worm Virtue that owes his Lustre to the Darkness about it.
<HI>Tacitus</HI> gives it as an ill In∣clination of <HI>Domitian</HI> the
Emperor's Temper, That he imploy'd himself in catching and tormenting Flies,
and that he turn'd his Scepter into a Fly-flap, and was therefore justly
esteem'd an Enemy to Flies, and a Fly to his Ene∣mies; <PB N="46" REF="85"/>
and truly they fall not under a much better Character, either for Wisdom or
good Nature, who snatch up all the fluttering Reports they can meet with to
the Prejudice of their Neighbour.</P>
<P>Whosoever hath a tender Side, the World will be sure to find it,
and to put the worst Colour on all that Man says or does, give an
Aggravation to every Thing that may lessen him, and a spight∣ful Turn to
every Thing that may re∣commend him; But that Wit is much misemploy'd, that
is wholly directed to discern the Faults of others, when it is necessary
to be used to mend and pre∣vent his own: When we do not fre∣quently turn our
Eyes inward, to see what is amiss within us, it is a sign we have an
unwelcome Prospect at home, when we care not to look upon it, but rather
seek our own Consolation in the Faults of those we Converse with.</P>
<P>Indeed, some Men's Tempers are so malign, that they wish Ill
to all, and be∣lieve Ill of all Men, like <HI>Timon</HI> the
<HI>Athe∣nian,</HI> who profest himself an universal Man-Hater: 'Tis
certain there are some, in whose Ears nothing sounds so harsh as the
Commendation of another, and nothing so melodious to them as a De∣famation.
<HI>Plutarch</HI> gives an apt Instance <PB N="47" REF="86"/> of this upon
<HI>Aristides</HI>'s Banishment. When a mean Person had propos'd
O∣stracisme, being asked, What Displea∣sure <HI>Aristides</HI> had
done, he reply'd, None, and that he knew him not, but that it griev'd him to
the Heart, to hear every one call him a Just Man. I verily believe some of
our keenest Ac∣cusers in these Days might give the same Answer; for
no Man that is eminent either for Piety, Loyalty, or Moral Vir∣tue, but he
shall have many invidious Eyes upon him, watching for his Halt∣ing; and if
any the least Obliquity be espied, he is used worse than the vilest
Malefactor, for such are try'd but at one Bar, but these are arraigned in
all Com∣panies and in all Discourses.</P>
<P>Next to rash Censurers, Flatterers are most dangerous, who may
be compar'd to Flies that have pretty shining Wings for two or three hot
Months, but the least cold Weather makes an end of them; or rather like the
<HI>Heliotrope,</HI> open only towards the Sun, but shut and con∣tract
themselves at Night. Let the Ob∣ject of their Adoration be but eclipsed,
they can see none of those Excellencies which before dazzled their Eyes,
and their old Idol is often made a Sacrifice to their new, and all malicious
Disco∣very <PB N="48" REF="87"/> is made of their falling Friend, to make an
Interest in their rising one. There are such Crowds of Examples of this
Kind in our Age and most un∣happy Kingdom, that it is fitter to fur∣nish
Precedents for the future, than to borrow any of the past Times.</P>
<P>This is certainly the most horrid Crime that could be committed,
and the black∣est Colour wherein we can view a Para∣site; and as an Ape
hath a peculiar De∣formity above other Brutes, by that awkard and ungraceful
Resemblance he has to a Man; so a Flatterer is infinite∣ly more hateful,
for being the ugly Coun∣terfeit of a Friend. A Pretence of Friend∣ship and
Kindness is now become the general Bait to all base Projects, all the
woolfish Designs that have been lately acted upon our <HI>English</HI>
Stage, have walked under this Sheeps Cloathing; and as the World goes, Men have
more need to beware of those who call them∣selves Friends, than those who
own themselves Enemies, because the one traiterously Betrays you,
whilst you ex∣pect no better from the other.</P>
<P>It was heretofore the Character given of the <HI>English,</HI> by
an ingenious Person, That they were both excellently En∣dowed, and rarely
tempered by God <PB N="49" REF="88"/> and Nature, and were the most piously
affected of all others; and that there were not in the whole World either
better Catholicks or better Protestants; that there was no Nation under
Heaven more remote from ill Nature and Re∣venge, nor Men who were more
ho∣nestly and even more naturally Just, nor so far distant from using
base Treachery of every Kind. But, alas, the Race is now spoiled by
mixture, and we are no more what we were, every one endea∣vouring to Deceive
and Delude each other; and that Freedom and good Na∣ture, (which was thought
peculiar to <HI>England</HI>) which is a kind of Balsom to the whole Life of
Man, (and without which Life is no better than a Punish∣ment, both to others,
and most of all to a Man's self) is banished out of our Na∣tion, and
those Flowers of Virtue, which were thought to grow no where else but in
our Island, are now degenerated into Weeds of Flattery, Treachery, and
Un∣dermining: Now the Suppression of this Vice depends upon those
Persons to whom it is addressed; let but Princes entertain such
Parasites with a severe Brow, and with sharp Expressions of
Dislike, these Leeches will immediate∣ly fall off. In <HI>Sparta,</HI> when
all Laws <PB N="50" REF="89"/> against Theft prov'd ineffectual, at last
they fixed the Penalty upon them that were robbed, and that did the
Business; and if it were made amongst us as in∣famous to be Flatter'd, as
it is to Flat∣ter, I believe it might have the same Effect.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> gives an excellent Exam∣ple of a Man that could
not be persua∣ded to Flatter, in the Person of <HI>Phi∣loxenus,</HI> who
being a good Poet, and despising some dull Poetry of <HI>Dionysius</HI>
the Tyrant, he was by him condemned to the Quarries; where having been for
some Time, he was by the Mediation of Friends recalled; and at his first
Ap∣pearance, <HI>Dionysius</HI> shew'd him some other of his Verses,
which he thought his Master-Piece; which, as soon as <HI>Philoxenus</HI>
had read, he made no Re∣ply, but call'd to the Guards to carry him back again
to the Quarries; a brave Example of a Heathen Poet, who pre∣ferr'd a corporal
Slavery before a mental.</P>
<P>As it is a great Part of Wisdom not to be flatter'd, so it is to
pass by the Reproaches of others: Herein we should imitate
<HI>Socrates,</HI> who being informed of some derogating Speeches one had
used of him behind his Back, made on∣ly this Reply, <HI>Let him Beat me
too,</HI> <PB N="51" REF="90"/> <HI>when I am absent, I care not</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> How∣ever, it is good to shun the Company of those
who take Pleasure in exposing others to Contempt and Derision, as one
would avoid the Heels of a Horse that Kicks every one he can reach.</P>
<P>It is the height of Incivility to abuse Persons in
Discourse; to abuse Inferiors argues a mean contemptible Spirit,
Su∣periors is dangerous; to abuse a Friend is to lose him; a Stranger, to
lose your self in his and the World's Esteem: We should therefore
endeavour to keep a fair Reputation with all Persons, with Superiors 'tis
good to be humble and complaisant, not low and flattering, with Equals grave
not morose, with Inferiors courteous and fair, not sullen nor
impe∣tuous.</P>
<P>'Tis an indiscreet Thing for a Man in Company to take Exceptions;
and if he have any Defect in his Person, which he suspects Men are apt to
make Derision of, 'tis a Folly to vex himself or quarrel at it; but the
best way to prevent others in their Scoffs of this kind, is, first to
speak, and let them know as much as they can tell him; and then he ought with
a manly Courage, to contemn, as unconcerned, the Indiscretions and Fol∣lies
of others: It is no sign a Man is <PB N="52" REF="91"/> sound, who complains
because one touches him. In my younger Days, I knew an old merry Droll, who
much frequented Company, who having in his Youth taken a great Liberty to rally
upon married Persons, in his declining Age took a Wife, where every one might
have had her for his Money; and the first Treatment of any Friend in his
Conversation, was still the Discourse of his own Marriage, to prevent
all that could be said against him.</P>
<P>And as we should not be troubled when others tell us of our
Imperfections, so on the other hand we should never Praise our selves:
It is a great Blemish for a Man to be the Trumpet of his own Excellencies; he
who puts a mo∣dest Rate upon his own Deserts, does best multiply his
Fame, but he that speaks in his own Commendations, does as if he meant to
Sell himself. And if the most accomplish'd would but seriously
consider his own Imperfections, how many Things he wants, and how few he
knows, and those how lamely, he would make use of his Reason and
Dis∣course, not for Commendation of him∣self, but to gain Instruction
from others. Such Men's Company is very trouble∣some, who are only
accustomed to the <PB N="53" REF="92"/> Admiration of themselves, thinking
no∣thing besides them worthy of Regard; if these unbred Minds were made
ac∣quainted with those Excellencies which God hath bestow'd on other Men,
they would not think themselves like <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Fleece, to <HI>have
sucked up all the Dew of Heaven</HI>; they would find perhaps they rather
answer'd the other Part of the Miracle, and <HI>are drier than their
Neigh∣bours:</HI> And if such will needs be re∣flecting on themselves, let
them com∣pare their Crop of Weeds and Nettles with that of their Corn, and then
they must either think their Ground is Poor, or themselves very ill
Husbands.</P>
<P>Now the way to Profit by Conversa∣tion must come from our
selves, our Question is the Fire, that draws out ei∣ther the
Quintessence or the Dreggs of Things; and therefore the usefullest Part
of Discourse is to give Occasion by ask∣ing Questions, by intermingling
our Dis∣courses with Tales, with Reasons, and telling of Opinions, it
being a Testimo∣ny of as much Knowledge, to ask a pertinent Question, as to
give a perti∣nent Answer: But herein a great Re∣gard is to be had in what
Company we do it, for great Men love not to be asked Questions, unless
where Questions <PB N="54" REF="93"/> may pull out the Thread of their own
Praises: He that in Discourse questions much, shall undoubtedly learn
much, if he apply his Questions to the Skill of the Persons with whom he
Discourses, and put them upon those Things they understand best; for
thereby he shall do them a Kindness, in giving them Occa∣sion to please
themselves in Speaking, because every one loves to Speak of that wherein he
is most expert, and himself shall continually gather Knowledge, by
fetching from every one the best that is in him; for when Men are reduced to
Speak of those Things wherein they are most conversant and skillful, the
con∣versing with them is an excellent School: But we shall commonly see
Men take the contrary Course, chusing rather to Discourse of any other
Profession than their own, supposing it to be so much new Reputation
gotten; but this way a Man shall never come to Perfection: As for Tales, to
tell a Story well, to continue it in a handsome Method, cloathing it with
suitable Expressions without Impertinencies, and to repre∣sent therein
Persons and Things to the Life, is one of the best, and perhaps one of the
hardest Parts of Conversa∣tion. The late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. my 
<PB N="55" REF="94"/> Master, of Glorious Memory, had a most particular
Talent of this Kind, and was wonderful pleasant in Conversation; and us'd,
very frequently soon after his Restauration, to have his private Sallies in
the Winter-Evenings, to divert him∣self with some particular Persons of
Wit, whom he still chose to Sup with him, where I had the Honour divers
Times, by his Majesty's Command, to wait up∣on him at Supper; (for he would
then have none of the Grooms of his Bed∣chamber with him.) In these
Divertise∣ments the King permitted those who Supped with him to make use
of their Wits in telling some pleasant Stories, and in quick and handsom
Repartees, wherein the King had an excellent Vein, and would as well take as
give without Offence; which Liberty was always us'd with great Respect by
those who had the Honour to Sup with him; which were usually, (<HI>Hannibal
Sested,</HI> base Bro∣ther to the then King of <HI>Denmark</HI>) the Duke
of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Lords <HI>Carling∣ford, Wentworth,</HI> and
<HI>Crofts,</HI> with Sir <HI>Frederick Cornwallis,</HI> Sir <HI>John
Mynnis,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Tom Killigrew.</HI> In these
Conversations, I have heard excellent Discourses, witty Repartees,
mingled with pleasant Tales, wherein the King <PB N="56" REF="95"/> had so
great a Faculty, that scarce any Thing could be said, which he would not
Parallel with some pleasant modern Story, which He would tell with such
Grace and Quickness as charm'd all the Company; but when he found them warmd
with Wine, and that their Wits began to be piquant and sharp, and to Sting
each other, the King would always then interpose his Royal Authority, and
would stroak over the severe Nips they gave each other, by throwing Dust
up∣on them, telling them, <HI>Good Jests ought to bite like Lambs, not Dogs;
to Tickle, not Wound:</HI> Wherein his Majesty shew'd great Prudence, for
we have seen in our Days many Examples of the Mis∣chiefs that have hapned
by too severe Railleries; in such Fencings Jest hath prov'd Earnest,
and Florets have been turn'd to Swords, and not only the Friendship, but the
Men have fallen a Sacrifice to the Jest: 'Tis sure we shall die in
Earnest, and it will not become us always to live in Jest; But the Gift of
Raillery in this Age hath devoured the more solid Qualifications, and is
accounted the greatest Accomplishment; a strange inverted Estimate, to
prefer the little Ebullitions of Wit before solid Reason and Judgment; if
these Men <PB N="57" REF="96"/> should accommodate their Diet at the same
Rate, they should eat the Husk rather than the Pease, and feed upon Froth
and Bubbles.</P>
<P>There is nothing more becoming a Gentleman than a Cheerfulness in
Con∣versation, every Thing being by so much the more lively and cheerful,
as it comes nearer to its Creation, and nothing hath more light and
sprightfulness in it, than an ingenious conversable Integri∣ty: Virtue is
the Mind's constant Health, the Pulse of it still beats true and even∣ly;
she is sprightly without Levity, free without Discomposure, and
conversable without Coyness or Cheapness, as free from Stupidity as
Lightness, from being a Log as a Squib. Besides, a Vivacity of Spirit is
usually accompanied with such a kind of Wit as makes us accept∣able in
Conversation: Cheerful Persons being graceful in all they do, are most
valuable in Company; For who had not rather associate himself with a
Merry conceited Humour, than with a <HI>Cynical</HI> Wise Man? Many Men
indeed blame Mirth because they cannot endure it; which is to blame the Sun,
because Owls cannot endure the Brightness of it; as if we should Quarrel
with Light, be∣cause our weak Eyes are dazzled with its Beams.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="97"/>There are some Men whose Disposi∣tions
lead them to fasten and feed on Miseries, and to glide over the
Plea∣sures of this Life; which puts me in Mind of what passed betwixt
<HI>Diogenes</HI> the Cynick, and <HI>Aristippus</HI> the Cour∣tier, who
passing by <HI>Diogenes</HI> as he was at Dinner in his Tub,
<HI>Diogenes</HI> said to him, <HI>If you could content your self, as I do,
with Bread and Garlick, you would not be the King of</HI> Syracuse <HI>his
Slave: And you,</HI> reply'd <HI>Aristippus, if you knew how to live with
Princes, you would not make such bad Cheer.</HI> 'Tis true, this morose and
pedantick Philosophy is not designed for a Gentleman, they are born to be
Sociable, and ought to understand all the Maxims of the World; Com∣plaisant
Humours, assisted with this practical Knowledge, gain the Friend∣ship
of all People, because they know how to set forth gracefully the Ta∣lents
of Nature.</P>
<P>There is no Means so powerful and apposite to divert the fixed
and intent Cares of the Mind, and to exhilerate a sorrowful Heart, as
pleasant Company and Musick, which mollifyeth our Minds, and stays the
tempestuous Affections of it, if there be any Dregs of Cares that lie lurking
in our Thoughts, most power∣fully <PB N="59" REF="98"/> it wipes them all
away. They say, <HI>Alexander</HI> one Day excited by the Mu∣sick of a
Harp, took Arms, and plaid the Part of a Common Soldier <HI>David</HI>
himself charm'd the Evil Spirit in the Body of his Father-in-Law, by the
Sweetness of his Harmony; and we daily see the Terror of Death cannot so
much affright Soldiers, as the Sound of Drums and Trumpets does animate them;
the Singing of the Nurse makes the Child quiet; which evidently
demonstrates the powerful Effects of it in Nature it self; and the very
Labouring Men find Satis∣faction in it, who Sing in their Work; and without
doubt, the Voice persuades and instructs much more than Reading, the
first being accompanied with certain Spirits which we may call Living, the
other is nothing but the Pourtraicture of the Thoughts of a Dead Man.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> in his <HI>Ʋtopia,</HI> makes Musick an
Appendix to every Meal; and <HI>Epictetus</HI> esteems a Table without it to
be no better than a Manger: <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. says <HI>Comines,</HI> at the
Inter∣view betwixt him and <HI>Edward</HI> IV. of <HI>England,</HI> invited him
to come to <HI>Paris,</HI> and told him as a great Part of his En∣tertainment,
that <HI>he should hear most sweet Voices, exquisite Musick, and
should not</HI> <PB N="60" REF="99"/> <HI>want the Company of fine Ladies, and
the Cardinal of</HI> Bourbon <HI>to be his Con∣fessor</HI>; which he
thought sufficient En∣dearments to such a sensual Prince as
<HI>Edward</HI> IV.</P>
<P>Indeed, innocent Mirth and pleasant Company whet out Wits, quicken
our Fancies, and make us afterwards more fit for any Employment: <HI>A merry
Heart is the life of the Flesh,</HI> says <HI>Solomon, and Gladness
prolongs his Days</HI>; and is high∣ly useful, when 'tis only our
Divertise∣ment, not our Business; but the excess of it is very
ill-becoming, and to set our Wits on the Tenter-hooks for so slight a
Purpose, is abominable: But merry Hu∣mours, tho' they have a great
Pleasant∣ness in them, are obnoxious to many, because if Jests (wherein
they are most conversant) be well receiv'd by some, yet they offend more
than they please, and create more Enemies than Friends: For tho' Points of
Wit be very fine in Discourse, yet if they be made so sharp as to draw
Blood, those that use them may have Occasion to repent of them. 'Tis
true, flashes of Wit give us a plea∣sant Light, so long as they burn not;
but this Liberty must be bounded with Caution; for Wit should rather
serve for a Buckler to defend by a handsome <PB N="61" REF="100"/> Reply,
than a Sword to wound others, tho' with never so facetious a Reproach: In
these Rencounters therefore the Charge should be Powder and not Bul∣lets;
and we must take heed, that we pass not from this familiar Freedom of
Drollery, which causes Mirth, to severe Scoffing, which provokes Scorn,
en∣dangers Quarrels, and gives an Umbrage of a spiteful Intent.</P>
<P>This pleasant kind of Wit is a Talent usually given to Youth to
play withal, and it is a pretty Gift to begin the World with, if they
understand the right Use of it; otherwise it is an unruly Engine, wildly
Striking, sometimes a Friend, and not seldom the Engineer himself. Sharp
Speeches therefore which fly a∣broad like Darts, are to be tenderly us'd; for
tho' they be Shot at others, they are many Times thrown back upon
them∣selves: As when the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> who had been
instrumental in the Pre∣ferment of Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> to be Lord
Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and thinking the Chancellor did not shew him
that Re∣spect he merited, meeting him acciden∣tally, he told him in Reproach,
<HI>Honores mutant Mores,</HI> alluding to his Name; which the Lord Chancellor
sharply re∣turn'd upon him, telling him, <HI>It was</HI> <PB N="62" REF="101"/> <HI>not true in</HI> Latin, <HI>but in</HI> English, <HI>That
Honours changed Manners,</HI> which was the Lord <HI>Rutland</HI>'s Sirname.
Thus we shall see some Men's Wits whip Opposi∣tion, and manifest the
Quickness of their Dexterity in the Shapness of their Re∣turns, (like the
Artisans Weapon, that makes his Enemies Arms his Enemies Destruction) and
by a nimble Repartee, turns the Words spoken upon the Speaker himself.
There is much Pleasure in this kind of Wit, there being no such Stil∣latory
as a quick Brain, which refines and makes use of whatsoever comes with∣in
the Pan for its Reception. But those Gentlemen who have this Satyrical Vein,
and make others afraid of their Wit, had need be afraid of other Men's
Me∣mories; for many times, after they have given others Occasion to Laugh,
they are made themselves to Cry.</P>
<P>The Rules to be given herein, are carefully to observe Times,
Circum∣stances, and Persons, knowing when to Jest, and when not; to use
apt and hand∣some Repartees, natural and not affe∣cted, that have more Salt
than Gall, speaking what is just and proper upon every Occasion, which is
better than fine Conceits, which yet are liked, if they be good; but
Equivocations, Quib∣bling <PB N="63" REF="102"/> with Words, and Puns, which
have only the appearance of Wit, are ridicu∣lous, and yet these have brought
some Men of very ordinary Parts into Cre∣dit. There is as much difference
be∣tween Jests pick'd up here and there, and those that come from the
Spring-Head, as betwixt wise Discourses, and harmonious Fooleries,
between a solid Sufficiency, and what is painted; a Jest should never be
serv'd up but once, when 'tis Cold the Vigour and Strength of it is gone.
Many refuse to wear Buff because 'tis lasting, and a Man of Wit will not
Apparel his Brain in Du∣rance. It is therefore pleasant to min∣gle Jest
with Earnest, for nothing pleases more than Variety; and it is a dull Piece
of Service to tire any Thing too far: But as all Creatures by secret
In∣stigation love to be doing that in which they are most able, so
these Men of Wit being delighted to hear themselves Talk, cannot contain
themselves within a Mean, nor have Patience sometimes to be Silent, so
that we may justly won∣der such absurd Persons should speak so
well: Now there are some Limits wherein these kind of Wits ought to be
circumscrib'd, there being certain Persons and Things priviledged from 
<PB N="64" REF="103"/> Jesting, as Religion, Matters of State, great
Persons, any Man's present Busi∣ness of Importance, and any Case that
deserves Pity: To Play upon any Man's Unhappiness or Deformity, is
inhumane, and Men may be as oppressive by their Parts, as by their Power;
and God did no more design the meaner Intellectuals of some for Triumphs to
the Vanity of the more acute, than he did the Possessions of the less
Powerful, as a Prey to the Avarice and Rapine of the Mighty; and it is a much
greater Barbarism to reproach a Man that wants the Gifts of Nature, than him
that wants those of Fortune; for a Beggar may have im∣poverish'd himself
by his own Fault, but in Natural Defects there is nothing to be charged,
unless we will arraign that Providence which hath so disposed: And
those whom God hath blessed with higher Degrees of Sagacity and
Quick∣ness, ought not to look down upon others as Objects of their Contempt
and Scorn, but rather of their Care and Pity, en∣deavouring to secure them
from those Mischiefs to which their Weakness may expose them, and their
Folly should nei∣ther dismount our Wisdom, nor violate our own Integrity:
But the World is grown to that pass, that Men will rather 
<PB N="65" REF="104"/> put stumbling Blocks in the way of the Blind, and pull
away the Crutch from the Lame, that they may Sport them∣selves to see them
Tumble, such a de∣light we take in improving the Imper∣fections of others,
that it's become the great Excellency of this Age to be dextrous at it. But
good Nature is willing to interpret Things to the best Sense, to take
Things by the right Handle, and will never go to the ri∣gour of the Matter, nor
break out at others Misfortunes; for to be touchy and peevish in
discovering a Fault, to kindle like Gun-Powder at the least Spark, is a
sign we are perfectly wrapt up in our own Interest, and that we have
nothing of Sweetness or Balsom in our Blood. We must therefore en∣deavour
to sweeten our Humour, and keep the Ferment down; and tho' the World be full
of malicious Men, yet by this we shall disappoint the Pleasure of ill
Nature, break the Force of an Af∣front, and make the Injury fall upon us like
Hail upon Tiles, rattle without Mis∣chief, and at last to tumble into
Dirt.</P>
<P>To jest at Calamities, is a great sign of ill Nature: When
<HI>Caninius,</HI> a Con∣sul of <HI>Rome,</HI> died the same Day he was
made Consul, <HI>Cicero</HI> would needs put a <PB N="66" REF="105"/> Jest
upon that Accident, and said, <HI>O vigilantissime Consul sub quo
nimo pransus est, nemo caenavit, nemo dormi∣vit, magnum prodigium vidimus,
Cani∣nio Consule, non sensimus ver, non esta∣tem, non autumnum: The
State,</HI> saith he, <HI>hath had a vigilant Consul of</HI> Ca∣ninius,
<HI>that never Slept in all his Con∣sulship.</HI> But this was justly
thought a Fault in <HI>Cicero,</HI> for Calamities are not to be the Subject of
Jests. <HI>I love Jests well,</HI> said a Wise Man, <HI>but not the
loss of my Friend</HI>; and those who lose themselves to shew their
Wit, are much like <HI>Helio∣dore</HI> Bishop of <HI>Tricca</HI> in
<HI>Thessaly,</HI> who having wrote the <HI>Ethiopick</HI> History ve∣ry
politely and elegantly, but withal somewhat loosely and wantonly, was
thereupon summoned by a Provincial Synod, who told him, His Work did more
endanger the Manners than profit the Wits of his Readers, as nourishing
loose and wanton Conceits in the Heads of Youth; and therefore they gave him
his Choice, either to retract his Book, or leave his Bishoprick; whereupon he
rather chose to resign his Place in the Church, than to lose the
Reputation of his vain Wit. And every Age shews us remarkable Examples of
this Kind; for Sharpness of Wit commonly carries <PB N="67" REF="106"/> with
it two ill Companions, Pride and Levity; ingenious Persons miscarrying in
nothing more than in too much plea∣sing themselves in the Goodness of
their own Conceits; where sometimes the like befalls them, which hapned to
<HI>Xeuxis</HI> the famous Painter, who having pictur'd to the Life an old
Woman, so pleas'd himself in the Conceit of his Work, that he died with
Laughing at it.</P>
<P>Being thus prepar'd with outward and inward Furniture for
Conversation, it is necessary to consider how and where to bestow it;
for he that is provident of his Time, will be also Prudent in the Choice of
his Company, and Choice of his Actions, least the first engage him in
Vanity, and the latter by being Cri∣minal, in throwing himself and his Time
away.</P>
<P>This World is link'd together by Love, and Men by Conversation;
and one of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatest
Pleasures we enjoy herein, (if duly weighed) is the sweet Society of
Friends and Relations, which multi∣plies our Joys and divides our Griefs; there
being no stricter Union upon Earth, than that of a virtuous Friend∣ship;
and nothing can be more Satis∣factory than to Improve and Benefit 
<PB N="68" REF="107"/> that Person who is thus become a Part of us.</P>
<P>Men of Quality love to deck and em∣bellish the Place where their
inhabit, and Friends dwell in each other, and therefore cannot but be delighted
in beautifying and adorning those Minds they have thus chosen to live in,
by purging them from all Foulness, and rendring them as splendid and
illustrious as is possible, and certainly there is no∣thing more
ravishing than a Friendship thus entertain'd: That Calamities at∣tend it as
well as Comforts, is but a weak Objection; for what Goodness is there without
Temptations, and what Happiness in this World not to be trans∣form'd: It is
the Gracefulness of every Thing that makes it valued; Gold, whilst it is in
the Mine, is good for no∣thing; when 'tis cut and beaten into the thinness of
Leaf-Gold, 'tis wasted and blown away, and quickly comes to no∣thing; but
when it is tempered with such an Allay, as it may receive a Stamp and
Impression, then it is Currant and Useful.</P>
<P>Thus Cynical Men, who out of Pride of their own Parts disdain
Company, and can no more endure Conversation than Owls the Day-Light, like
Gold in <PB N="69" REF="108"/> the Bowels of the Earth, their Parts are
useless and good for nothing, who cannot without Offence walk the Pub∣lick
Ways; they are Saints indeed in private, and live only to God and to
themselves; but being call'd forth into common Life, they are like Bats in
the Sun, and utterly ignorant of Publick Affairs. And the Conversation and
Friendship of those whose End is only Civility and mutual Visits, like
Leaf-Gold they are blown away with every little Wind of Distaste, or
Neglect of Ceremony; and in an equal Degree to these are they to be reckon'd,
who are <HI>Amici inter prandium &amp; sartaginem, ad ostium tabernae
fratres &amp; amici, ad osti∣um carceris neque fratres neque amici:</HI> But
the useful and profitable Conversa∣tions which give a right Stamp and
Im∣pression to our Minds, are those Friends that will be Supporters to us
in our Pro∣sperities, Safeguards in our Difficulties, Counsellors in our
Doubts, and Comforts in our Adversities. With these we ought to contract a
strict Acquaintance and Inwardness, and to embrace their Com∣pany upon all
fitting Opportunities, using herein a wise Moderation, which carries with
it both an Honour and Grace of Manners; for to seek Com∣pany 
<PB N="70" REF="109"/> and to fly it, are two Extreams to be blamed; to shun
all Company argues a Contempt of others, and makes us generally hated; and to
seek too much after them, is a sign of Idleness in our selves, and
makes us slighted: We must love our Neighbours as our selves; and to
shew that we love them, we must not avoid their Company; and to shew that
we love our selves, we must sometimes be alone, and take Pleasure in
our selves. The <HI>Italians</HI> have a very significant Pro∣verb, which
says, <HI>Measure it a hundred Times before you cut it off</HI>; meaning
you should stand upon your Guard, till you discover the Inclinations of
those you converse with, and therefore we should be careful of laying out
our Friendship too lavishly at first, since like other Things it will
be so much the sooner spent: Neither should it be of too quick a
Growth, for the Plants which shoot up too fast, are not of that Continuance
as those which take more Time for it: We shall see some who have hot
and cold Fits of Friendship, that shall hug you one Day, and not know you
the next; this Unevenness of Temper is by all Means to be avoided in
Conversation; a good Man will always keep a steddy Course of
Friendship, which may run <PB N="71" REF="110"/> like a smooth Stream, and
never change, but be a perpetual Spring; for we can∣not find the Gust and
Relish of a true and fixed Conversation, till we come to a great Freedom
with each other; for they that converse only as Strangers, are always under
some Restraints and Uneasiness, and do never open them∣selves freely
the one to the other.</P>
<P>In the long Experience I have had in the World, I have seldom, if
ever, found any Man's Company worth enjoying, that did not begin with some
Difficulty, if not Prejudice; for Conversation, like Oysters, is nothing
the better for open∣ing so easie, and so soon. Neither is there any
more dangerous Acquaintance, than that over-hasty Familiarity contra∣cted
betwixt good Fellows, as we call them in <HI>England,</HI> who usually begin
their Friendship in the Entry, and strike it up in the Cellar, where
Servants are disci∣plin'd to be the Ministers of their Ma∣sters Luxuries,
whose Vices seldom miss to be taken up by them, as if they were the
Badges to witness to whom they be∣longed. There is no greater Mark nor
Discovery of a Man, than to judge him by the Company he keeps, it being
im∣possible but that he shall much resemble them, and partake some of
their Qua∣lities. <PB N="72" REF="111"/> <HI>Si juxta claudum habites, sub
claudicare disces,</HI> says <HI>Plutarch: Bad Company is very contagious
to the wisest and best settled Men.</HI> What befel <HI>Jo∣seph</HI>
was out of Contagion, frequent∣ing the <HI>Egytian</HI> Court learnt him to
Swear by the Life of <HI>Pharoah. Dum spectant oculi laesos, laeduntur
&amp; ipsi, Multaque corporibus transitione nocent.</HI> I remember
<HI>Aristotle</HI> in his Problems makes a Question, Why Health does not
infect as well as Sickness, a diseased Per∣son often communicating his
Infirmity, never his Health; the Reason is, says he, because the Health
of the Body hath no transient Force on others, and is per∣sonal and not
communicative. But <HI>Mal∣vezzi</HI> tell us, it is, for that Nature in
Providence drives away the Evil from it self, and thriftily reserves that
which is Good; and for this Reason it is, says he, that those who have
the Plague are desirous to come into Company, that they may give it to
others; and by the same Reason, those who have ill Qualities in them,
will be sure to work and apply their Vices, like Rust, into the nearest
and purest Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> II. of <HI>England</HI> was a sad Ex∣ample hereof;
for his <HI>alter idem,</HI> his great Favourite <HI>Gaveston,</HI> was a Man
of <PB N="73" REF="112"/> excellent Parts of Body, and of no less Endowments
of Mind, being both va∣liant and witty; and if his Valour could as well have
made the King valiant, as his Riot made him riotous, there might have come
some Good of their extra∣ordinary Conjunction; but seeing Vir∣tues are but
personal, and Vice com∣municative, it made the King not on∣ly more Vicious
than he would have been, but Vicious where otherwise in all Appearance he
would not have been. The Consideration of this most mis∣cheivous and
dangerous Conversation, caused <HI>Seleucus</HI> to make a Law, where∣in he
forbad all Company with wicked Men. And <HI>Charondas</HI> the Lawgiver
punished those for wicked, who frequen∣ted Lewd Company. Neither was it a
sufficient Answer, which <HI>Antisthenes</HI> gave, when he was told of
his Conver∣sation with wicked Men, That Physi∣cians live amongst the
Sick; for tho' they help sick Men's Health, they sure∣ly impair their own,
by continual visi∣ting and touching diseased Persons: But yet this
must be favourably under∣stood; for there is no Rank or Quality of
Persons so absolutely excluded from our Conversation, but only such a
De∣gree of ill Company, as may Poison and <PB N="74" REF="113"/> Corrupt the
Good; for in nearer than Company, our Friend, and in some∣what nearer than
him, our selves, we must allow some Inordinaries, and ma∣ny Grains of
Allowance must be given to make the best of us Currant: There may be
likewise Occasion sometimes of conversing with ill Men, not for
Socie∣ty, but Business, and for Reformation, as our Saviour converst with
Publicans and Sinners. And therefore no Man is so tied up, as to come in no
Company but good Men; for he that cannot live amongst the wicked, must
seek for a∣nother kind of World than this, and for more perfect Creatures
than Mor∣tals: It was not ill said of the Philo∣sopher, <HI>Omnes odit qui
malos odit: He that hates ill Men hates all Men:</HI> And if a Man will love
none but honest Men, where will he find any Exercise, any Object of his
Love? If a Man will hold Friendship with none, do Offices of Society to none
but good-natur'd and sociable Men, he will leave many necessary
Businesses undone: The fro∣wardest and perversest Man may be good
for some particular Occasion; a crooked Piece of Timber is not thrown
aside, 'tis good for some Uses; the very Flesh of a Viper is made an
Antidote, be∣ing <PB N="75" REF="114"/> mingled with other Simples and
In∣gredients, and by good Company and kind Usage many an ill Man is better'd.
And since a Magistrate ceases not to be a Magistrate for being an ill
Man, much less does a Man cease to be a Man, and so to have Title to
those Duties of Con∣versation and Business which are rooted in Nature,
because he is of an ill Dispo∣sition. It is indeed a great Part of
Wisdom to contract Friendship and In∣wardness with none but good Men,
that so by our Intimacy with them we may participate of their Goodness; for
Men are not like Bees, whose Sweetness makes Things of another Nature
Sweet, it must be good we receive, and then per∣haps we shall make it
better, but if ill, we make it worse.</P>
<P>Some Naturalists say, there is a way of Castration in cutting
off the Ears, that there are certain Veins behind the Ears, which if cut,
cause Barrenness; our Ears are the Aqueducts of Know∣ledge, and if we cut
those, that is, in∣termit our Conversation with good and wise Men, this
will prove a Castration to our Understanding. The Advantages we receive
hereby was well intimated, in that which <HI>Socrates</HI> said to
<HI>Eschines,</HI> who seeing every Body give <HI>Socrates</HI> 
<PB N="76" REF="115"/> something, he said, <HI>Because I have no∣thing
else to give thee, I will give thee my self: Do so,</HI> says
<HI>Socrates, and I will give thee back again to thy self, better than when I
receiv'd thee:</HI> And certainly the Conversation of well-dis∣posed Men,
who have most look'd into the Affairs of the World, and have stu∣died Men
as well as Business, is a great Improvement of our Understanding, and
Fortifier of our Judgment, especially if they be Men of Years, Experience,
and Virtue, and fam'd for Wisdom, for their Testimony is of greater Force,
and some∣thing is always to be learn'd from them. For where Wisdom holds
with Age, and Memory hath not unthriftily spent her Comings in upon Time,
their Con∣versation is certainly the wisest Book; there is only one Fault
accompanies them, their great and unwearied Desire of Talking, which seems
troublesome to many that hear them; yet I must con∣fess, in my younger
Days, I have ever heard such with Delight, and did at all Times most
joyfully accept what they deliver'd, who are of all others most a∣ble to
instruct Youth; and surely there is much Reverence owing that Age, which
deserves a fatherly Respect and Honour from us.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="116"/>A Gentleman in Conversation should be
Affable, not Imperious, knowing Hu∣manity and Gentleness is a common Debt to
Mankind, and therefore will not contract his Civility into so narrow a
Compass, that it shall swell into Com∣pliments to them above him, and not
suffer one Drop to descend on those be∣neath him, but will so
dispose its Streams that all Channels may be fill'd with it: But some
Gentlemen, like the Pharisee, think they are not like other Men, and having
mounted themselves aloft, look down upon all below them, as little and
contemptible creeping Things of the Earth; not considering that the
distance betwixt noble and mean Men, is only valuable, as a Defence against
base and ignoble Practices, true Greatness con∣sisting in despising
not the Persons, but the Errors of the Vulgar.</P>
<P>It is great Prudence in Gentlemen to associate themselves, as
near as may be, with Persons of their own Rank and Quality; for in such
kind of Friendships well chosen, consists the Fruit and Uti∣lity of
Conversation.</P>
<P>To keep Company with great Men is very dangerous; and he that
soars in so high a Sphear, runs the hazard of <HI>Ica∣rus</HI>; for if
great Men love his Com∣pany, <PB N="78" REF="117"/> it is either for their
Pleasure, be∣cause he hath Wit, and tickles their Fancy, or he hath Parts
which they make use of for their own Advantage; and it is common with them,
never to quit or advance such Persons, but still feed them with Hopes,
that their De∣pendance may be wholly upon them; and when such great Men die
or are disgraced, their Fall is the Ruin of their Dependants. My Lord
Chancellor <HI>Ba∣con</HI> wittily resembles such (who have Intimacy with
and Dependance upon great Men) to Fasting Days, which stand next to Holy
Days, but other∣wise are the Leanest Days in the Year. The wise
Historian tells us, <HI>Nunquam secura cum potente societas.</HI> The
Dan∣ger of such Acquaintance is well repre∣sented in the Fable of the Lion,
the Fox, and the Ass, who keeping Com∣pany together, they went one Day a
Hunting, where the Lion having taken a great Prey, he bid the Ass divide the
Spoil, who put all into three equal Por∣tions, which so much offended the
Lion, that he immediately kill'd the Ass and devour'd him, and then commanded
the Fox to divide, who put all into one great Heap, and set by a little
Morsel for himself; and being asked by the <PB N="79" REF="118"/> Lion,
<HI>How he knew so wisely to divide,</HI> answer'd well, <HI>The Fortune
of my Bro∣ther Ass hath taught me:</HI> And if I had as well understood the
Moral of this Fable when I learnt it at School, as I did afterwards by
dear-bought Experience, I had not stood so long in the Ass's Place; but
<HI>sero sapiunt Phryges.</HI></P>
<P>Now there are some Men so far from this Humour, that they always
keep Company with mean Persons, and those below them; whereas there can be
no true Friendship, but betwixt Equals: And therefore wise Men will not
only avoid conversing with such who are much Superior, but also with
those who are much Inferior, not only in Degree, but in Parts, for <HI>tanti
eris aliis quanti tibi fueris</HI>; and that our Thoughts and Designs will be
such as our Companions are, and low Fortunes breed many times degenerous
Purposes, and he that makes himself an Ass, invites others to ride him;
and it is a very mean Ambition to be the best in the Company, it be∣ing an
experienced Truth, That he who desires always to be the best Man in the
Company he keeps, shall soon be∣come the worst of any Company he comes
into.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="119"/>And yet this Conversation, tho' bad, is not
so dangerous as keeping Company with Fools, Folly being no good Tutor to
teach Wisdom; neither can a wise Man contract Friendship with a Fool,
their Qualities being so far different: For when any Man is taken with
ano∣ther's Conversation, it is a great Argu∣ment that they are both of the
same Sen∣timents, but a Fool serves for nothing, but sometimes to divert
an ingenious Man, and no other use can be made of him.</P>
<P>But those who love Multitudes are in worse Danger than in
keeping Company with Fools; for such live in a Crowd, and a Herd is not
Company; the very smell of them offends a wise Man, and where the Crowd of
Men is, there is the Crowd of ill Customs; and since 'tis hard to avoid
Temptations when they come single, How shall we escape them when they
come upon us in a full Body? How can we think of any thing but Ill, when we
see nothing that's Good? Young Gentlemen who are newly come into the World
with great Fortunes and ill Breeding, seek great Meetings, and Sin for
Company to gain Experience. And therefore 'tis no wonder they are entangled in
Debts, and made a Prey <PB N="81" REF="120"/> to Cheaters, and embroiled in
Quar∣rels, so long as they frequent such Con∣versation. It was in such
kind of Com∣pany I conceive <HI>Seneca</HI> meant, when he said, <HI>He never
went amongst Men but he came home a worse Man that he went out.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst wise Men, the principal End of Company is Conference,
and Con∣ference to be better'd by is not usually met with in Crowds, where
Men meet not like Bees to make Honey, but like Wasps, who love to feed in
Dung; in such Company you shall hear Men speak neither honestly nor
temperately, Slan∣der or Flattery ingrossing all their Dis∣course, so
that no Man can be better'd by their Conversation, the chattering of Magpyes
being better Musick than a Consort of such senseless Persons;
nay, a Desart is to be preferr'd before such de∣bauch'd Companions, for the
wildness of the Place is but unchearful, whilst the wildness of Lewd
Persons is infe∣ctious.</P>
<P>Besides these, there is another Con∣versation, which is that
of Women; and tho' young Gentlemen are general∣ly pleas'd to think this a very
innocent Diversion, yet none is more dangerous, es∣pecially as to the
Woman's Part, and proves <PB N="82" REF="121"/> often a more pernicious Calamity
than that which thrusts Men into Hospitals; Such Men as spend their whole
Time, like <HI>Sardanapalus,</HI> amongst Women, and yet pretend Chastity,
are ridiculous.</P>
<P>If these hear of a beautiful Woman, what Contrivances and
Designs do they lay first to see her, and then to corrupt her, and make
it their great Business, as well as Trade, for their Agents and Factors to
spring such Game; and upon these Occasions, those will liberally
Sa∣crifice all their Time, of which, when any charitable Office would borrow
from them some Minutes, they are then such busie Persons, they can by
no Means afford it; but to go in quest of such Game, to have the Company of
Women is their only Delight and Pastime: But Ladies must take heed of
such dange∣rous Conversation; and especially by how much the more lively
they are, they are the more liable to be hurt, as the finest Plants are the
soonest Nipt by the Frost.</P>
<P>The World is a dangerous Stage for Women, where Virtue alone will
not defend them, unless join'd with much Prudence; they must have both for
their Guard, and not stir without them, and all little enough, for the Enemy
being <PB N="83" REF="122"/> abroad, they are sure to be taken if they be
straggling. Their Behaviour there∣fore must ever incline strongly towards
the reserved Part, the deceitfulness of the Age we live in having made this
Caution highly necessary: For tho' most Men seem indeed Plantonick
Lovers, and so at first as humble Gallants they are only admitted for
Trophies, yet they very often become Conquerors, and from Admirers grow into
Masters. Besides, the World is not so great a Fool, as not very well to
know, that frequent Visits made to handsom Wo∣men soon grow Suspicious,
since we know all Men are pleas'd with what is Handsome: <HI>Stimulus
carnis,</HI> is a na∣tural Vice in all Men, and Lust is no way better
restrain'd, than by keeping far from such Creatures.</P>
<P>He that will avoid committing Sin, must shun the Occasions;
for the best Philosopher cannot make me believe, but that every Man
naturally is pleas'd with a savory Morsel: And they that make
Profession of not staining their Reputa∣tion with Spots of Uncleanness,
ought to shun all that allures thereunto; for it is not only a great Peice of
Folly, but an infinite Rashness worthy to be punished, to make Gun-Powder
in a <PB N="84" REF="123"/> Smith's Shop, with Hopes to make People believe
there is no Danger in it.</P>
<P>Some learned Physicians affirm, and Anatomists do also tell
us, When a Wo∣man bears Twins, if they be both of the same Sex, they are
enwrapped in one Film, but if of different, wise Nature parts them; And if
Nature thinks not fit to lodge a Brother and Sister toge∣ther in so tender
an Age, this certainly teaches us, that Persons of different Sexes cannot
live safely together; and those who relie upon their Strength and Vir∣tue,
in such Occasions, are certainly more Rash than Wise: And those young
Ladies who promise to themselves ne∣ver to go so far, as to be gain'd,
nor to admit any but indifferent Favours, such as Civility allows; and after
having gi∣ven Way to more than they should, they find a Precipice, where they
expected only Entertainment: And that Woman who will allow her self to go to
the ut∣most Extremity of every Thing that is Lawful, is so very near going
farther, that those Gentlemen who lie at Watch, will begin to Count upon her:
For Men are apt to turn every Thing that a Wo∣man does to the hopeful Side; But
yet few are so Impudent as to make an <PB N="85" REF="124"/> Application, till
they see something which they are willing to take for an Encouragement.</P>
<P>And therefore it is much more honou∣rable and safer for Women to
prevent such Forwardness, than to go about to cure it; nothing being with
more Care to be avoided by them, than such a kind of Civility, which may be
mistaken for an Invitation</P>
<P>I wish many imprudent Ladies had not found the Truth of this, Men
often stealing from little Favours to greater, and still carry on their
Designs, till ma∣ny Times they change their Intreaties into Threats, and
their Softness into Violence; and then those Women find too late, that true
Simplicity is abused, when it deals with falsifyed; the fear of losing
their Reputation, after having given some Advantages which they ought not to
have done, hath debauched ma∣ny Women, and therefore they ought to be very
cautious what Men they ad∣mit into their Company, and of gran∣ting the least
Civilities. For as the Sun shining upon a Looking-Glass melting the
Quicksilver, presently causes Spots; so if a young Gentleman do but
look upon a beautiful Woman, a Flame of Love presently arises: The ancient
Phi∣losophers <PB N="86" REF="125"/> knew this well, which made them
prescribe Absence for the Reme∣dy of Love, that Men should not see
their Mistresses: But she knew it bet∣ter, who said to her Lover,
<HI>Discede, discede, a foculo meo, nam si te vel mi∣nimè,
igniculus meus afflaverit, ureris infimé.</HI> And what
<HI>Propertius</HI> says is most true: 
<Q> 
<L>Crescit enim assiduè spectando cura puellae,</L> 
<L>Ipse alimenta sibi maxima praebet amor.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the last Place, there are some Con∣versations which are
neither good nor bad, profitable for nothing, but only Recreation, Men who
seem as it were made for no other Purpose but to divert from serious
Affairs: And since even Saints themselves have had their Diver∣tisements,
and that all Persons are al∣low'd some Breathing-time of humane Delight, we
may therefore safely spare these Men that Leisure, which is set
a∣part for our Conversation, and some∣times lend our selves to them, that
we may be the better enabled to return to our serious Employments.</P>

<PB REF="126"/>
<HEAD>Of Solitariness and Retirement.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is nothing so Pre∣judicial to Action, as to be always in
Action; for the Mind, like the Body, is tired, by being always in one
Posture, to be too serious breaks it, to be too diverting loosens it;
so that to unbend our Thoughts, when they are too much stretched by our
Cares, is not more natural than necessary. The Eye sees not the Objects
touching it, but those only remote, and the Understan∣ding continually
plunged in Affairs, is not so quick and piercing, as his, who sometimes
retires from Publick Employ∣ments: Experience teaches us, that the Eye having
lost its quickness by much looking upon the Light, recovers its vigour
again in the Dark; and as the most curious Gravers are obliged to look
sometimes upon green Flies, to recollect again their scatter'd Sight; so
the Spi∣rit, being weakned and distracted with variety of Affairs, ought to
recover its Force in the Privacy of some small Re∣treat. 
<PB N="88" REF="127"/> In the Heat and Tumult of Bu∣siness, Reason hath
not Power to give Conduct to active Life, Man having but an imperfect
Understanding without Me∣ditation, and therefore as Bees must retire to the
Honey, after they have gather'd the Matter from Flowers; so it is
necessary, that we retire into our Selves, to gather the Fruit of our
Ex∣perience, otherwise we shall be but ill Husbands of the Wealth we have
got∣ten.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Fruit we gather from our many Days of Company is very
little, we scatter much in Conversation, we gather but small Profit; but
for the few Hours we spend in Retirement and Re∣collection the Return is very
considera∣ble, and the greater Portions of our Time we lay out this way, the
more Treasure we lay up for our Selves here∣after. This inward
Consideration is a large and powerful Study, to such as can seriously
Taste and Employ them∣selves therein. It is the Nourishment and Life of
our Spirit, and Nature hath favour'd it with this singular Privilege, that
there is nothing we can do so long, neither is there any thing more easie,
more natural, or more our own, than to meditate and entertain our Thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="128"/>Thus, as often as the Mind (inter∣rupted in its
Operation by external Ob∣jects) would have the Body to be still and quiet, it
presently betakes it self to Retirement, when neither Wife nor Children,
Kindred nor Business, nor whatsoever else can make any Trouble, are to
be seen, all Things being exclu∣ded that can disturb: But since this
so∣litary Employment and Entertainment of our Selves, is either one of the
best or the worst Things we can undertake; it must not therefore be in
Vanity, much less in any Thing that is Vicious, but in Study, in profound
Knowledge, and in the diligent Culture of our Minds.</P>
<P>He that will withdraw himself, must first prepare to receive
himself: It is not Wisdom to let the Spleen govern us, to over-drive Nature
is to draw a Blemish upon our Judgment; Men that retire should first
examine the Difficulty of the Enterprize, for without this preliminary
Prudence, a Man may over-burthen his Shoulders, and soon wade out of Depth.
And tho' Solitude promises fair, and is a strong Engagement to a retired
Person, yet it is to many better in Prospect than in Possession: It
is a great Folly to trust our selves if we cannot govern our selves, and
he had need be very well assur'd of <PB N="90" REF="129"/> himself, that
falls into his own Hands, for it often happens, that none are more dangerous
than our own; and therefore wisely says the <HI>Spaniard, God keep me from
my self.</HI></P>
<P>That Man is much mistaken, who thinks Solitude a Sanctuary
against all Vices: It is good against such as pro∣ceed from without us,
but it hath its inward and spiritual Difficulties. And tho' the Devil be
busie in all Places, yet he takes Solitude to be his Ground of Advantage,
from whence oft-times he plays his Batteries with most Success. Thus we
see he ventur'd to attack our Saviour himself, when he found him in the
Wilderness, to shew it is most dan∣gerous for those to be alone that
are not Masters of themselves; there being no Security from Danger by
running away from the World, especially if Melan∣choly drives us to Solitude,
which makes the Mind uneasie, and ill Thoughts are no Foreign Commodity, but
purely of our own Growth, which are most dan∣gerous in Solitude; for many
Men, who have well preserv'd themselves in Com∣pany, have been lost in
Solitude. <HI>Lot</HI> was Chaste even in the City of <HI>Sodom,</HI> yet
defiled in his Cave. To an Impru∣dent unadvised Man Solitude is a dan∣gerous 
<PB N="91" REF="130"/> Staff; and it's to be fear'd, that whilst he Walks
alone, he entertains more and worse Company than himself, Mens Vices many
times giving them the Taste of Solitude, making them so much shun Company
and seek the more Elbow-Room. For a Man may as well fail a∣lone as in
Company, there are ways for it, until such time that he hath fram'd himself
such, as to become <HI>Sibi Thea∣trum,</HI> that he so much respects his
Rea∣son and fears his Conscience, that he cannot without Shame stumble or
trip in their Presence, that he dare not halt before himself, but bears a
kind of Re∣verence and Respect unto himself, which next to Religion is the
chiefest Bridle against all Vice. <HI>Cicero</HI> in this Case gives an
excellent Direction, <HI>Observen∣tur species honestae animo: Let
honest Ideas still represent themselves before our Mind. Let us,</HI>
says <HI>Seneca, repre∣sent</HI> Cato, Phocion, <HI>and</HI> Aristides,
<HI>to our Imagination,</HI> (in whose Presence even Fools would hide their
Faults) <HI>and establish them as Comptrollers of all our Actions.</HI></P>
<P>It is certainly a rare Thing, <HI>Ʋt satis se quisque
vereatur; That every Man should sufficiently stand in Awe of
him∣self:</HI> We should win so much upon our <PB N="92" REF="131"/>
selves, as to be able in good Earnest, and willingly to be left alone, to
quit the World if need be, to dwell and de∣light in our selves: We must
break those Bonds asunder that fasten and bind us to each other; and not
so tie our selves to the Things of this World, that our Felicity depend
upon them, but reserve a Store-house for our selves, (what need soever
happen) wherein we may secure and establish our true Contentment and
principal Retreat. This Store-house is a wise Man's Mind, which moves and
turns within it self, and is well conten∣ted to keep it self Company, and
en∣joy it self: And when the World frowns upon us, and that we are barren of
Em∣ployments, we ought then to betake our selves to the secret Improver of
Minds, Contemplation, thereby adorn∣ing our House within, and make it rea∣dy,
if for Guests that is for Business, and if they come not, 'tis no matter,
it will be the better for us to live in. Thus we must bring home our
Cogita∣tions to our selves, that our Contentment may depend upon what is
within us, nei∣ther seeking nor disdaining Employ∣ment, but cheerfully go
on either with or without it, with a calm and undi∣sturbed Mind. For this
World is a <PB N="93" REF="132"/> Comedy, where every Man acts that Part which
Providence hath assigned him; and as it is esteemed more Noble to look on
than to act, so there is no securer Box from which to behold it, than a
safe Retreat, it being easier to feel than express the Pleasure that
may be taken in standing aloof off, and in contemplating the Reelings of the
Mul∣titude upon the Stage of this World.</P>
<P>There is no Counsel more proper for Men than the Philosopher's,
<HI>Tecum ha∣bite,</HI> to dwell at Home, and not to suf∣fer any Thing to
steal us away from our selves; there is neither Profit nor Plea∣sure
worth so much, that we should go abroad to seek it. Even amongst
<HI>Pagans</HI> the wisest look'd upon the Things of this World as Lumber
rather than Furniture, as Things which they needed not, and retired within
their own Breasts, which they call'd their Home, there to enjoy Virtue their
only Good: And many of the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Sect (who propos'd to
themselves no other End but their own Contentment) did bereave themselves
of all sensual Delights, and contemn'd the Glory and Pomp of all worldly
Wealth and Greatness, for the only Pleasure of Contemplation. But now a
wise Chri∣stian, that may within his own Breast <PB N="94" REF="133"/>
enjoy both Virtue and God himself, hath much higher Advantages, and more
Reason to keep within that Home, and to look upon Things without with an
indifferent Eye. That Man therefore forgets his Origin and his Dignity, that
puts his Soul out of Possession of her self, by running perpetually
after Hopes that fly from him; whereas he should aban∣don the Pleasures of
this Life, and bid adieu to all manner of Vanities, shun∣ning all
Passions that may any way im∣peach the Tranquility either of Mind or Body,
making God the only Object of his Contemplation: He that thus re∣tires, draws
no Man's Envy upon him, he reigns by himself, and all the Pomp which
Greatness draws after it, is not compa∣rable to that which he enjoys in
Secret; for as that Man must needs be accounted most Happy, that is
likest unto God; so Man's chiefest Happiness must needs con∣sist
in the Contemplation of his Divine Majesty and of his Works. And indeed,
nothing but the Supports of Religion, and a Spiritual Retreat, upon that sole
Account, can make a Man fit to enter∣tain himself, withdrawing upon the Score
of Religion. Thus to shut up the Pro∣spect of this World, that we may take
the better View of the other, is a pru∣dent <PB N="95" REF="134"/> Precaution:
Thus we untwist our Affections, and slide off from the World, before the
World slips from us; thus to retire is the best Improvement of Soli∣tude,
and to be thus Alone is the way to bring us to the most desireable
Com∣pany.</P>
<P>To Retire for Quiet and Thinking is commendable, <HI>Amici fures
Temporis,</HI> says the Lord <HI>Bacon.</HI> Conversation is a Thief that
steals away a great Part of our Time, and usually stuffs our Me∣mory with
Rubbish; Solitude is a great Relief in such Cases, and wise Men are
glad to get clear of the Crowd for fresh Air and Breathing. It is not Noise
and Flashes, Thunder and Lightning, that make fair Days, but it is the Sun's
cast∣ing a clear and pleasing Light, with gen∣tle Gales; so a Life led in
sweet Tran∣quillity (which is the work of Reason) is much preferable before
all the great Successes which the World admires, and which are nothing but
the Extravagan∣cies of Fortune: In Retirement, we taste the Sweet of a quiet
Repose, and enter∣tain our selves with Freedom; nay, we live more in two
Days of Retreat, and we are more sensible of what Life is, than in two
Years full of Business and Trouble, and we see greater Things in 
<PB N="96" REF="135"/> Retirement than abroad in the World: For what do we see
great in the World, unless it be perhaps an Army, the Siege of a Town, or the
Court of a Prince? We are quickly accustom'd to these, which only appear
great to us at the first Sight. But in Retirement, we look up∣on the
different Works of Nature, the Sun rising and setting, a still Night, and
those Planets which so majestically Roul over our Heads, which we
continually ad∣mire. It is observ'd by learned Physi∣cians, that those
who dwell farthest from the Sun, (if in any convenient Distance) have
longer Life, better Appetites, Di∣gestion and Growth, than others who dwell
not so remote from the Heats thereof; Such Advantages, and much greater, have
their Minds, who are well removed from the Scorchings, the Daz∣zlings and
Exhalings of the World's Glory, into a private Retirement: Whereas those who
live in the Throng of Business and Company, their Minds lose their Rest
and Tranquility, and many times after a Man hath lost his Rest, he loseth
his Labour also.</P>
<P>It is a great Misery for a Man never to be his own; too much
Acquaintance makes us Strangers to our selves; the more we converse with
Men, the less <PB N="97" REF="136"/> we converse with God, and the Con∣tent
which we may expect by our Con∣versation with Men, is lost by too much
Conversation. I know Society is one of those Satisfactions which are
reckon'd amongst the Pleasures of the first Mag∣nitude in this Life; but
when we con∣sider that the Advantage of Society con∣sists not in seeing
each other, but in rational Conversation, it will appear, that Solitude is
much more Satisfactory; for what Pleasure can be receiv'd in talking of new
Fashions, of great Pur∣chases, of Advancement or Ruin of Favourites,
Victories, or Defeats of stranger Princes and Armies, some of which are the
usual Subject of ordinary Conversation; and in Courts and great Cities, Men
neither seek nor find any other Divertisement, than visiting each other,
reviewing their Habits, talking of new Fashions, or of the Weather, or some
such pitiful Stuffs; and if Men discourse upon more serious Subjects,
they are sure to be contradicted, which often causes Quarrels. Besides,
in these Rencoun∣ters, Men are tempted to betray their Ignorance, or their
Malice, in either of which they are esteem'd Blockheads or Quarrelsom: And
if we converse with those who speak with more Address than 
<PB N="98" REF="137"/> our selves, we repine at our own Dul∣ness, and envy
their Acuteness; and if we converse with Duller than our selves, we are
soon weary, and fret at our be∣ing in ill Company: And if by chance we
accompany our Equals, then we are upon our Guard, to catch all Ad∣vantages,
that we may be thought more knowing; and we are so interested in this Point
of Honour, that such Conver∣sation rather vexes than recreates, and many
Persons make themselves cheap upon these Occasions, whom we had highly
valued if we had frequented them less.</P>
<P>That Man who dwells upon himself, and is always conversant with
himself, rests in his true and proper Center; and therefore he that hath
learnt Wisdom from the Folly of others, and the Mis∣carriages of his own
Actions, will be content to see the Crowd afar off, and not any more thrust
into it, but retire within himself: It is true indeed, there is no Place but
there are means in it to do Well or Ill; a Man may live a∣lone in the Throng of
a Palace, but if he may chuse he will avoid the Sight of it: If need require,
he will endure the Court, but if he may have his Li∣berty, he will be alone;
for Contagion <PB N="99" REF="138"/> is catching in a Throng, and a Man must
either imitate the Vicious or hate them, and both are dangerous: He that is
care∣ful to avoid Occasions, starves his Sin; those are rare Men that can
live in the midst of Temptations and not fall: <HI>Ne∣mo diu tutus periculo
proximus, &amp; quae licita, sunt ritanda, propter vicinitatem
illiciti.</HI></P>
<P>We have never greater Cause to con∣sult our best Wits, what we
are to do, and how we are to carry our selves, than when Preferment or
Publick Employ∣ments are offered us. It was no idle Que∣stion asked by an
eminent Man, Whe∣ther if great Places or Employments were offered us, we
should refuse or ad∣mit them? wherein the divers Abilities of Men are to be
considered: He that hath Strength and Wisdom to manage such Places may
receive them; but he that would live quietly ought not to en∣tangle himself
with more than he can manage; let him try, <HI>Quid ferre recu∣sent, quid
valeant humeri</HI>; the strong and virtuous Man may possibly meet and
encounter Temptations with Advantage, which the more cautelous will avoid; and
in one of these two Ranks every good Man is found; and we may well compare
them to <HI>Hannibal</HI> and <HI>Fabius,</HI> <PB N="100" REF="139"/> the
first always calling for Battle, the other evermore declining it.</P>
<P>There are indeed several Degrees of Solitude, and those wisely
retire, who being harrassed with the Fatigues of a Publick Life,
foreseeing ill Weather, are willing to put into Port, when keeping out at Sea
might endanger the Vessel: When the Winds go cross, 'tis Pru∣dence to
furl the Sails: Thus that great Prince <HI>Charles</HI> V. when he found his
Success began to fail him, he present∣ly withdrew.</P>
<P>To be able to check our Enemy, to encounter Occasions, to act our
Part upon the common Stage of this Life, and yet to keep our selves Upright,
this is indeed truly to live; but to avoid Oc∣casions, to overcome the World
by re∣tiring from it, argues a wise, tho' in the World's Opinion, a weak and
faint∣ing Spirit, who think there is no greater Argument of Imperfection in a
good Man, <HI>Quàm non posse pati solem, non multitudinem,</HI>
not to be able to appear in Publick without Offence, and who can only live to
God and himself, <HI>Ʋtilis ipse sibi, fortassis inutilis
orbi:</HI> Tho' this indeed be the weaker Side, yet certainly it is the
safer, rather than by an improvident Fool-hardiness, to 
<PB N="101" REF="140"/> thrust our selves upon Occasions, which we are
unable to manage without Of∣fence.</P>
<P>There is not amongst Men a greater or more frequent Error
committed than in this Kind; for in most Things of this World, Men that have
no Skill in them, will be content to acknowledge their Ignorance, to give Place
to better Ex∣perience, and will advise and consult with every one in their
proper Mystery; but let Offer be made of Places of Ho∣nour, Money or
Preferment, no Man will excuse himself, or acknowledge his Ignorance or
Weakness to manage them; whereas our Errors are no where so dan∣gerous, as
in the unskillful managing of these Things; and therefore it is better to be
cautious and wary, than strong and hardy: <HI>Malo cautior esse quam
fortior, fortis saepe captus est, cautus rarissimè:</HI> We read
in Holy Scripture of a Race of Men so much greater in Bulk than or∣dinary,
that Men of common Size seem'd but as Grashoppers to them; yet we find the
little Men were always too hard for them, and drove them out; because the
Gyants depended upon the Opinion of their Strength and Hardiness, the others
upon their wary Wit and Policy; and it commonly happens so in this World, 
<PB N="102" REF="141"/> and we shall find that far more have pe∣rished by
unadvisedly venturing upon the Things of this World, than by sober and
discreet Retiring.</P>
<P>But many Men over-rate themselves, whose Expectations being
great, when they are not caress'd and humour'd in their Folly, they
presently grow chagrin and sick of the World, and fall into a Fit of
Retirement and Melancholy, and will keep no longer Company with any. These
Men, like Children when cros∣sed, grow sullen in a Corner; but he that
thus shuns Company and retreats, re∣tires only like a Beast to his Den.</P>
<P>We have seen many Examples, where Greatness hath ruin'd
several Persons, who liv'd with much Honour and Re∣putation before.
<HI>Nero, Tiberius,</HI> and some others, enjoy'd the Repute of No∣ble Souls
before their mounting the Im∣perial Throne, which brought them new Vices with
their Honours, and made them as much surpass others in their Debauches, as
they did in their Power; so that Publick Employment is scarce to be
wished for, seeing Men are tempted thereby to commit the greatest Crimes.
<HI>Moses,</HI> who was the Meekest of Men, whilst he lived in the
Wilderness; yet when Providence advanced him, he so <PB N="103" REF="142"/>
highly offended God, that all his for∣mer Services could not obtain the
Li∣berty of his entring into the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' at the Creation God found it not good for Man to be alone,
and there∣fore gave him a Companion; yet to shew the Hazard of being in
Company, even <HI>Adam</HI> could not live one Day in it, and be Innocent; for
the first News we hear of him after <HI>Eve</HI> was associate with him,
is, That he had forfeited his Native Purity.</P>
<P>When God intended to converse with <HI>Moses,</HI> he call'd him
from the populous Camp to the Top of Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>; and Christ did not
disclose the Glories of his Transfiguration at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but on
the Top of the Mount of <HI>Olives:</HI> When God did discipline his beloved,
yet rebellious People of <HI>Israel,</HI> he chose first the
Wilderness, then the two Cap∣tivities to be his School.</P>
<P>History tells us of many, who out of their Skill and Strength have
given free Entertainment to the World, and have made large use of it, in all
ways of Greatness and Expence, when their Time and Hour came, would rather
have gone out of some poor Cottage, than out of a Princely Palace, and lived
with no <PB N="104" REF="143"/> Noise in the World, that so they might have
died in Peace: <HI>Charles</HI> V. the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> and sundry
others, tho' they liv'd in all Pomp and State, yet at their Death they
desired to be buried in a Capuchin's Habit; and if they thought, to die in a
State of perfect Se∣questration from the World was so pre∣cious, how much
more available had it been to live in it? For thus to die, not having thus
liv'd, is nothing else but to give Sentence against their own Life; for we
shall not appear before God as we died, but as we liv'd; to profess
Desertion of the World at one's Death, as most do, is only to be buried in
a Capuchin's Hood.</P>
<P>It was a notable Answer given by the Philosopher to
<HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> who when he told him, <HI>He would Conquer</HI> Greece,
<HI>then</HI> Rome, <HI>and so all the World: Cy∣neas</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Why
he would give him∣self so much Trouble</HI>; to which <HI>Pyr∣rhus</HI>
answer'd, <HI>He would do it, that he might afterwards live happily and
mer∣rily with his Friends</HI>; but <HI>Cyneas</HI> re∣ply'd sharply, <HI>He
might live so pre∣sently, and not take so much Pains for it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="144"/>Men that are still busied in Publick
Affairs, whose Mercurial Genius inclines them to a restless Life, they
(like <HI>Moses</HI> on <HI>Pisgah</HI>) see Retirement, their Land of
<HI>Canaan</HI> afar off, but without Hopes of Enjoyment: And we have seen
some great Men, who would never leave Em∣ployments till outed of them, like
Whales and other great Fishes that never come on Shoar till they are wounded,
and then these Men have prais'd Retirement, not to satisfie their Reason,
but their Re∣venge; yet even this Proceeding of theirs commends Retirement,
since even the distressed expect a Protection there, for Distress
makes Men run where they may expect Help: And certainly those, who after
possessing great Places in Courts, have been unexpectedly disgra∣ced,
will be more really convinced of its Slipperiness, than such as never found
the Effects of so much Revolution: Nay, those Men who seek greedily after
Pub∣lick Employments, pretend thereby a Design for Solitude. Thus Merchants
seek about the World, that they may gain so much as may afford them the
Conve∣niency of a Retirement: And Soldiers have often nothing to sweeten
their An∣xieties, but the remote Prospect of some good Garrison for a
Retreat. And <HI>Caesar</HI> <PB N="106" REF="145"/> himself said,
<HI>Aliquando mihi licebit mi∣hi vivere, He would have his spare Hours,</HI>
esteeming that Part of his Life to be∣long to others, which was spent on
other Men's Employments.</P>
<P>Now the wonder is, that the same Im∣pulse which hurries Men to
desire to be Great that they may be Masters, should not with far more
Reason carry them to be Solitary, where they are free from those
Necessities, and have none to obey but God and Nature, Masters who
command us nothing but what were fit for us to do, tho' we were not
com∣manded.</P>
<P>This Consideration hath made many Holy Fathers retire into
Desarts (where they scarce had any other Nourishment but their own Juice,
nor any other Com∣pany but God) that they might tend the Work of their
Salvation without Di∣sturbance: There they did as it were descend into
their Sepulchers by deep and holy Meditation; and from those Hermitages
inriched the Treasure of the Church, with their Divine Works con∣futing
Gain-sayers, and increasing the Stock of Holy Learning.</P>
<P>But it hath not been unusual for some Men to retire from the
World, and yet look back at it, as <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife at <HI>Sodom,</HI> 
<PB N="107" REF="146"/> and oftentimes to keep their Hearts in it: Thus did many
of the Philosophers who left the World in Effect, but not in Affection; for
in their Retirements they had nothing but their Arms and Legs out of the
Throng, their Minds and Intents were still engaged, and they only went back
that they might leap the better, and with a stronger Motion make a nimbler
Offer again into the World: These Men did not take the right way, they
thought they had total∣ly taken leave of all Business, that they might live
at more Leisure and greater Ease; but they mistook themselves, and only
exchanged one Employment for another; for tho' they had shaken off the Court
and Publick Employments, they had not taken leave of the principal Vexations of
Life, nor had discharged themselves nor their Minds of the Bur∣thens which
oppressed them; they had not so ordered it, that their Contentment
de∣pended wholly upon themselves, and that they could live alone in good
earnest, and at Ease: However, Men may converse with the World, and yet
leave it; we may find Retiredness in the greatest Ci∣ties, we may pass
thro' a Crowd and not mingle with it; and we may enjoy our selves in a
multitude of unknown Per∣sons, <PB N="108" REF="147"/> as if they were the
Personages of an <HI>Arras</HI> Hanging.</P>
<P>Every Ship that sails must needs have some Part of the Ship
under Water; every Man that lives in this World must have some of his
Labours spent upon the World; but as that part of the Ship by which a Man
sails is above the Water, so that part of us which is above the Earth, we
must remove it from the World. Thus some who have attain'd to that
Sublimity of Mind, as to be a∣bove all worldly Cares, tho' they med∣dle with
the World as being of the World, yet they do it so safely, that they cleave
not to it, nor are astonished to leave it.</P>
<P>Thus many great Men, after the Fruition of all Earthly Honours, have
much preferr'd Solitude; As <HI>Snatocopias</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI>
after the Loss of a Battle against the Emperor <HI>Arnold,</HI> he retired
into a Desart, where having lived several Years with three poor Hermits, he
at his Death told them, <HI>There was no Greatness preferrable to the
Tran∣quility of that Solitude he had injoy'd with them, which he esteem'd as
true Happiness; whereas that Life he had led upon his Throne deserv'd more
the Title of Death than Life:</HI> And <HI>Simi∣lis</HI> <PB N="109" REF="148"/>
a great General to the Emperor <HI>Adrian,</HI> after all his Honours and
Pre∣ferments, retir'd into the Country for seven Years before his Death, and
caus'd this Epitaph to be written upon his Tomb: <HI>Here lies</HI> Similis
<HI>of a very great Age, who yet lived but seven Years</HI>; rela∣ting only
to the Time of his Retire∣ment.</P>
<P>It was nobly observ'd by that great Emperor <HI>Marcus
Aurelius,</HI> who was also a Philosopher, That a Weaver or a Cobler would
willingly sequester them∣selves from all Company, that they might
prosecute their several Trades; and yet Man cannot retire himself that he
may admire the Creation, and exercise his own Soul, which is the great Trade
of a rational Creature, and of a true Phi∣losopher: And since Gain can
prevail so far with Men, as to make them re∣nounce Society, and esteem
Company an idle Folly, why should not we reflect upon the great Advantages of
Retire∣ment, both as to Morality and Devo∣tion, which are much preferrable to
those Things which are in themselves but Tri∣fles if not Burthens. For
certainly So∣litude hath more Pleasures in it, than any Publick Employment,
for it drives us into Contemplation, which is so charm∣ing, 
<PB N="110" REF="149"/> that it may rather be said to ravish than please,
committing so open a Rap∣ture upon our Souls, that it puts them almost into
a State of Separation.</P>
<P>Thus the old Hermits, Members of the Catholick Church, are often
remar∣ked for being as far transported out of themselves, as they had
formerly tran∣sported themselves out of the World: And even amongst the
Heathens, we find <HI>Pythagoras</HI> almost distracted with the
Satisfaction he conceiv'd in finding out his Demonstrations: And
<HI>Pliny</HI> was so delighted with the Pleasure of con∣templating the
Rarities of the Moun∣tain <HI>Vesuvius,</HI> as for farther Inquiry he
approach'd so near, that he lost himself in the Flames of it.</P>
<P>What Calmness and Contentment did <HI>Archimedes</HI> shew in
the midst of the Ruins of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> being so pleas'd with his
Demonstration, and so busie about his Knowledge and Contemplation, as he
heard not the Noise and Clamours of the Enemy, and could not spare so
much Time from his Intendment, as to ask Life from the rude Conquerors, when he
was interrupted and kill'd by them. Here was a Tranquility which look'd
gloriously thro' Danger and Death: It is not Pomp and shining Robes that 
<PB N="111" REF="150"/> give Grace to the Body, but it is the Mind within the
Body.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates,</HI> that great Master of Breed∣ing, tells us, That
young Men should be instructed, Men in the Flower of their Age exercis'd in
well-doing; but old Men should withdraw themselves, and retire from all
worldly Affairs: It being no less than highly necessary, that a space
of Time should be interpos'd, between the Business of Life, and the Day
of Death, that when they come to leave the World, they may have no∣thing else
to do but to Die. And who∣soever hath laid up in his Mind where∣with to
entertain himself in the Shadow and Retirement of his Age, will look upon
that temperate Climate of his Time as the most sweetned and digested part
of his whole Life, free from the Hurry∣ings of all the other, he then treats
him∣self with the best Company, that of his own Thoughts and
Observations; and with the Philosopher, when others are sorry he is grown
Old, he is only sorry that he was ever Young. Indeed, when Decrepitness
kills Experience, when Age acts the Prologue to Death, and draws the Curtains
before our Senses, it is then high time to give that Life leave to think only
of Death, and to prepare for its <PB N="112" REF="151"/> last Journey: For it
is a Right and Ju∣stice Men owe themselves, who have given their most
active and flourishing Age to the World, to give their declining Age to
Solitude and Retirement, and since they have liv'd long enough for others,
they ought to give the Remainder of their Lives to themselves to call in
these Thoughts and Intentions; and since God gives them leisure to
prepare for and order their Remove, they ought to make themselves ready, to
disintangle themselves from their worldly Engage∣ments, and since they
have hitherto liv'd Swimming and Floating, they should come now, and Die in
the Har∣bour; it being but reasonable for that Man to shake off Society
that can bring nothing to it; he that cannot Lend, let him take heed of
Borrowing; and when our Forces fail us, it is then a part of Prudence, as well
as Safety, to retire. But for Men in the Strength of their Manly Vigour, that
are endowed with publick Abilities, and excellent Orna∣ments, the use whereof
is only in So∣ciety, for such to retire for their Ease or Idleness, and
to do good to none but themselves, is very injurious to the Publick, and
resists not only Reason but Goodness, both which join in guid∣ing 
<PB N="113" REF="152"/> us to common Good. A Man of excellent Parts, who thus
retires under Pretence of meditating, and leaves no Fruit of his Meditations to
the World, is like the River of <HI>Jordan,</HI> whose fair and quick Water
is lost in the Lake of <HI>Sodom,</HI> call'd the <HI>Dead Sea.</HI> This is
to Die living, to lose the Quickness of the Mind in the Gulph of
unprofitable Idle∣ness; it is indeed leaving the World in the worse
Sense, for it is a forsaking Mankind, and denying to Society that Service
and Duty which we owe it.</P>
<P>For if Men of Publick Employments and Professions should
husband all their Time so thriftily, as not to give any Part thereof to
Business, but bestow it all in Retiredness, yet even thereby they would
contract a Guiltiness: As the Eagle were very unnatural, if (because she
is able to do it) she should pearch a whole Day upon a Tree, staring in
Con∣templation of the Glory and Majesty of the Sun, and in the mean time let
her young Eaglets starve in their Nest.</P>
<P>Both ancient and modern Histories have furnish'd us with
Examples of some Kings, who have willingly resigned their Kingdoms, and
deposed themselves; but whether they did this meerly out of a Desire to
live retiredly, or to satisfie <PB N="114" REF="153"/> their Sons being
arrived at Years fitting to Rule, that so they might see the
Suc∣cession settled in their own Blood, or to shun the Tumults of
Rebellion, or out of Fear of some potent Enemy, or un∣aptness of
Government, are great Que∣stions left as yet undecided in the World. But if
any Prince hath done so gallant an Action, (which is so strongly
with∣stood by human Nature) as to renounce a Kingdom, by Virtue of a Soul
in∣amoured of that Felicity which is injoy'd in a private Life, and that out of
a well∣disposed Mind he preferr'd the Peace of Retirement before the
Hazards and Trouble of Reigning, and that divested himself of his
prosperous earthly Con∣dition, purely that he might be Happy, that Prince was
not only truly Wise, but was undoubtedly more bound to God for giving him
that Power, and that Performance, than for making him a King. But that King who
shrunk un∣der the weight of Government, where Men ought to shew the
greatest Worth, or hath renounced his Kingdom out of Poorness of Spirit,
that Prince is much to be blamed, for that the true Mode∣ration of Soul is
seen in gallantly under∣going Cases of Adversity, and not in losing a
Man's self in Prosperity.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="154"/>Indeed, Prudent Men, that know themselves
not able to withstand the Temptations of the World, will wisely and timely
retire from it: Staggs, when they find themselves too fat, are said to
retire for Safety to the Woods and Thickets, knowing that being burthen'd with
their own Weight, they are not able to run if they should be hunted; which,
if true, shews a great Provi∣dence in Nature. And if we seriously
consider, we shall find that Multitude and Abundance are far more
troublesom, than Solitariness and Want; in Absti∣nence, there is only
need of one Duty, but in the conduct and use of many Things divers Duties are
required. Thus the Calling of a King or Prelate, is far more difficult than
that of a Monk or Hermit, and the Sociable Life is much harder than the
Solitary, by how much it is more easie for a Man to live altogether without a
Wife, than in all Points duly to live and maintain himself with her; and
therefore Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury,</HI> a very ingenious Man, was us'd to
say, <HI>That next to no Wife, a good Wife was best:</HI> For he that hath
Wife and Children, Servants, Estate, and Business, hath without
comparison a more troublesom Task, than he that <PB N="116" REF="155"/> hath
none of all these, and hath only to do with himself: <HI>Facilius est
domi la∣tere, quam foris se posse sufficienter cu∣stodire:</HI> And
therefore Speculative ju∣dicious Men do discreetly and piously, that leave
the Employments of the World which require the whole Man, to give themselves
some Intervals to the Office of Men, as they are Men and Chri∣stians.</P>
<P>Such Retreats as these are most com∣mendable, where Men
sequester them∣selves from the Troubles of the World, that they may the
better <HI>vacare Deo &amp; studiis:</HI> For thus they do more good living
out of the World than in it; Nei∣ther do such Men as these embrace
So∣litude out of meanness of Spirit, or for weakness of Parts, as not fit
to attain Greatness, or not able to bear with the World, but they do it
purely, that they may arrive at that Happiness which is usually injoy'd in
a retired virtuous Life.</P>
<P>History affords us many Examples of Men, who have known how to
com∣pass the Prime Places and Supream Dig∣nities both in Church and State,
who have had the Acquisition of Wealth and Greatness in their Power, tho'
not in their Aim, and who have with much <PB N="117" REF="156"/> Honour
relinquish'd Riches to embrace Poverty, and to enjoy Solitariness and
Retirement, having voluntarily left the most gainful and weighty Employments,
and after a full Fruition of all earthly Happiness and Pleasure, have taken
a solemn Leave of the World, whilst yet Fortune smil'd upon them. A great
Example in this kind, was <HI>Quintus Mu∣tius Posthumius,</HI> that Noble
<HI>Roman,</HI> who having been taken from the Plow to be Consul, after he
had govern'd that People and conquer'd their Enemies, he return'd to his former
Employment; and being ready to leave the Senate, he called for his Balance, and
by put∣ting the Fasces, the Mark of his Office or Authority in one Scale, and
his Plow in the other, did let the Senators see, those Imperial Ensigns
were far the lighter, and so took his leave of the Senate, and return'd to
his Plow. Such Men as these are truly Happy, who have left Cares and Troubles
for Calmness and Quiet, they possess a Happiness, which Kings can
neither keep themselves, nor suffer amongst their Neighbours; These are
so far from complaining of the World, that they are content to for∣get it,
and are resolved neither to have War nor Commerce with it, having 
<PB N="118" REF="157"/> founded a Retreat to all their Passi∣ons, as well
the pleasing, as the trou∣blesom.</P>
<P>But we shall find few Men that will be content to do this Thing
seriously; sudden Wishes and indeliberate Proffers and Attempts to
renounce the World are but rash Pangs of seeming Mortifi∣cations. There are
not many that will be content with a mean Estate, that will neglect Wealth
and Abundance, and desire God not to heap too much upon them, but to abate of
his Portion: There are but few that will with <HI>Daniel</HI> refuse the
King's Delicacies, and feed upon Pulse, and with the great St. <HI>Paul</HI>
take Pleasure in Necessities: Many in∣deed will tell us, They are
resolved to quit the World both in Mind and Body, but Custom is a Thing we
often fall in∣to by flying it, and we shall not unfre∣quently hear Men
swear they will not swear. I verily believe many of our Loyal Countrymen
have had so sad Experience of this World, and do so little desire to
learn that which they are ignorant of therein, that they would be very glad to
forget what they already know of it, and do really wish they were like some
of those Hermits, that inquir'd how Cities were made, and what kind of 
<PB N="119" REF="158"/> Thing a King or a Commonwealth was?</P>
<P>There is no Voice sounds better in a sober Man's Ears, than that
which cry'd to <HI>Arsenius, Fuge, sede, tace</HI>; which coun∣sels Men
to give themselves Satisfaction by their quiet retiring: <HI>Crede mihi qu
bene latuit, bene vixit,</HI> said a wise Man: But yet wheresoever we
are, or in what Condition soever, (if we can but tell our selves what and
where we would be) we may make any Place or State happy to us: For we are so
composed, that if Abundance or Glory scorch or melt us, we have an earthly
Cave (our Bodies) to go into by Consideration, and cool our selves; and if
we be frozen and contracted with lower and dark For∣tunes, we have within us a
Torch, a Soul brighter and warmer than any with∣out, we are therefore our own
Umbrel∣la's, and our own Suns.</P>
<P>But as all Shadows are of one Colour, if we respect the Body from
which they are cast; so all Retirings into a shadowy Life, are alike from
all Causes; only the Employments, and that up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n which we bestow our Time, gives it the Tin∣cture and the Beauty.
Thus our Sha∣dows upon Clay will be dirty, and in a Garden green and flowry;
so in our <PB N="120" REF="159"/> Retirements, if we only converse with
Earth, we shall be like it, that is, unlike our selves: But if we be
ingaged in more refined and intellectual Entertain∣ments, we shall be
something more than our selves, that is, than this narrow Cir∣cumference of
Earth speaks us, the Soul being always like the Object of its De∣light and
Converse; and therefore well says the <HI>Roman</HI> Orator,
<HI>Erigimur</HI> &amp; <HI>la∣tiores fieri videmur, humana despicimus
contemplantésque supera &amp; caelestia, haec nostra ut
exigua</HI> &amp; <HI>minima contemnun∣tur.</HI></P>
<P>However, it is not enough to be on∣ly separated from the
Converse of Peo∣ple; for tho' we have freed our selves from the Court and
from the Market, yet we are not thereby free from the principal Torments of our
Life; tho' we change Places never so often, yet may our Vices follow us even
into im∣mured Cloysters: The hollow Rocks, the wearing Hair-Shirts, and
continual Fasting, rid us not always from them, for a Holy Habit cleanses
not a foul Soul. And as <HI>Socrates</HI> being ask'd, <HI>Why one who had been
long abroad, had not more improv'd himself by Travel,</HI> answer'd well,
<HI>Because he had not left himself behind him when he went to Travel:</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="160"/> So before a Man leaves the World, if he do not first
discharge both himself and his Mind from the Burthen that presses her,
Retiring will but stir it the more, and press it the harder, as a sick
Man takes more Hurt than good by changing Place: It is but settling an Evil
instead of removing it, and if we cast back a kind Look upon what we have
left behind, we still carry our Fet∣ters along with us, and are not at
Li∣berty. We ought therefore first to re∣cover our selves from our
selves, for without managing our Superior Part, all the Pains taken about the
Inferior is to no purpose: And he that only chan∣ges his Cloth of Gold for a
Monk's Habit, and his <HI>Point de Venice</HI> for a Demy Collar, shall
without doubt be a Loser by the Bargain: It is indeed no such easie
Matter, as many Men believe, to make a safe Retreat from the World, to
truss up our Baggage, and bid our Company farewel; this is a Burthen which
few Men can take up handsome∣ly: For a Man to anticipate the Acci∣dents of
Fortune, to deprive himself of his present Advantages, is an Action of
extream Difficulty, as well as of an ex∣traordinary Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="161"/>But tho' the doing these Things seem very
severe to our worldly Imaginations, and to those who never had Experience
in themselves of this noblest Operation of the Soul; yet doth this retiring
pro∣duce so great Effects, and carries with it such spiritual Charms and
Delights, that should good Fortune her self come in Person to find them
out, who are thus withdrawn, to invite them again into the World, yet would
they shut their Doors against her; and tho' she should tell her Name,
she should not be admitted. The Religious retir'd Man is an inverted
Pyramid, Earth hath but the least Point of it; A Soul that dwells in Heaven
will not dabble in this im∣pure Mud, or stoop to be a Copartner in the
Delights of the Creatures, that have nothing but Beast in them; and tho' it
be necessitated by its relation to Flesh to a terrestial Converse,
yet it is like the Sun without contaminating its Beams.</P>
<P>Thus Religious Persons, when they come abroad into the World,
partake not of any worldly Humour, they can safely look upon the Throng, and
(more truly than <HI>Socrates</HI> at the <HI>Olympian</HI> Games) give God
thanks, that he hath made them not to need those many <PB N="123" REF="162"/>
Things which others so vainly and vio∣lently pursue: Their rais'd
Contempla∣tions inlarge and ennoble their Spirits, and infinitely advance them
above the ordinary Level; Such Souls as these (that were only lent the Earth,
to shew the World their Folly in admiring it) possess Delights, which
in a manner an∣tidate Immortality, and (tho' at an hum∣ble distance)
resemble the Joys above, they receiving here some Anticipations of immortal
Delights, as Pledges of their eternal Rewards; for there want not Examples of
some, who have had their Souls elevated to such a height of intel∣lectual
Contemplation, that God hath made them as it were, in some measure,
Patterns of the Happiness of the Life to come, which he hath sometimes
vouchsafed to shew us here below, to make us in Love with the Piece above
in Heaven.</P>
<P>This Divine Contemplation is, <HI>pro∣mus &amp; condus coeli &amp;
situla gratiae</HI>; it opens to us all the Treasures of Heaven; This
remedies all our Sorrows, settles and composes all our Distractions, and
ravishes our Spirits with unspeakable De∣lights; to which purpose St.
<HI>Francis de Sales</HI> says most Divinely; <HI>We see the
Re∣straints which Religious Persons put up∣on</HI> <PB N="124" REF="163"/><HI>themselves, we discern their outward Bitterness, but we are
not able to appre∣hend their inward Sweetness and De∣light; the very Fire and
Flames were to the Martyrs, Flowers and Perfumes.</HI></P>
<P>How injurious a Scandal is it there∣fore, which we are apt to cast
upon Re∣ligious Persons, representing them with angry and stoical
Countenances, and de∣faming them with melancholy and un∣sociable Humours,
believing Retirement to be a State, wherein the Soul contracts a Rust, which
cankers its own Sub∣stance, and makes it unpleasant to others; Whereas our
Saviour assures us, there is no Life so pleasant and happy; and tho' he
himself is said never to have Laugh∣ed, yet his Countenance is said ever
to have been Smiling, and in full Condemna∣tion of morose Humours, it was
prophe∣sied of him, <HI>Quod non esset tristis</HI> in his
Conversation.</P>
<P>It is indeed an ill way of judging, That Men cannot have Piety in
their Hearts without Austerity in their Looks, (a Virtue stuck with
Bristles is too rough, when adorn'd with Flowers it will be willingly
entertain'd) a cloudy discon∣tented Face is not the only, or best sign of
Devotion, very merry Men have been very holy and devout Men: No 
<PB N="125" REF="164"/> Man loves to see such Religious, whose Thorns he
is afraid will scratch him; for Christian Philosophy hath nothing in
common with the Cynick; this dis∣guiseth, the other reforms; the one
composes the Countenance, the other regulates the Spirit; the truly Religious
are Austere to none but themselves, their Thorns prick no Body else; it
be∣ing a Vulgar Error to believe, that those which retire with the greatest
Strictness should not have their Diver∣sions; all the Hours of their
Lives are not equally Serious, neither are all their Sayings, Sermons; it being
a Right most proper to them of all others, to have this <HI>Olium
laetitiae,</HI> this Balm of their Lives, this spiritual Alacrity, which does
even dignifie their Service to God; For these seek it where it is to be
found, and therefore we may be sure they ga∣ther it from the right Tree, it
being the only Fruit of a good Conscience; and since that is to them a
continual Feast, there is no Reason but they should be Merry at it: This
is the Substance of all their Actions, and their constant Triumph, having
this they want nothing, <HI>Quamvis ipsis nihil est, nihil deest</HI>:
All their Treasure lies in the Temple of <PB N="126" REF="165"/> Wisdom,
which they do so well im∣prove, that they become living Books to them that
converse with them, il∣lustrating their Minds without Preju∣dice to their
Sight, their Instructions having much more of Power and Life, than Reading
can possibly be capable of.</P>

<HEAD>Of St. MARY MAGDALEN's Life and Conversion; with some
Reflections upon the Conversion of the Good Thief.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EING in a Place and Sea∣son where every Thing be∣gins to Bud, I
must do so too, and vent some of my Thoughts; tho' perhaps, as all other
Buds are yet without Taste or Virtue, these Lines may be also dull and
insipid; and tho' the Pleasantness of the Season invites me, it does
not much please me, since I see every Thing refreshes, but I wither and
grow Older, but not Better, my Strength diminishes, and my Load grows
heavier.</P>
<P>There are certain Rules for the Bo∣dy's Infirmities, which if
rightly observ'd will effect their Cure; but for the Di∣seases of the
Mind, there is no Rule, for our own Taste and Apprehension, which should
be the Judge, is the Disease it self.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="167"/>I am now no more transported with Jollity,
and the love of Company, ha∣ving at present Loads heavy at my Heels, which
bring to my Thoughts my ill Fortune, my old Age, the Duties of a Man, of a
Subject, of a Husband, of a Father, with all the Incumbrances of a numerous
Family; these Thoughts de∣ject me into Sadness and Melancholy, and from
thence into a serious Contem∣plation of the Troubles and Miseries of this
Mortal Life; which have farther in∣duced me, in this Time of Solemn De∣votion,
to entertain my Thoughts upon some Divine Subject, the better to com∣pose
my Mind and submit my Will to the Orders of Divine Providence.</P>
<P>I know well, as no Beauty, so no Discourse hath all Voices,
even in the worst Faces some Eyes see Features that please, in the
best some others see Lines they like not; some out of Affection may
Plat a Lawrel for that Head, on which others in their Opinion would bestow a
Thistle, which may perhaps be my Fate: However, I am not ambiti∣ous to hang
the Ivy-Garland at my Door, least I should seem like those Hosts that
use to meet their Guests upon the Way, and promise before-hand a fair and
ample Entertainment; Let it please my Reader <PB N="129" REF="168"/> rather to
see and allow his Cheer, and then according to his own Palate he may
disgust or relish the Cookery.</P>
<P>I doubt not but many an accurate Quill on the Wing of Contemplation
hath already taken a high Flight upon this Subject; my only Plea shall be, He
that cannot Soar like the Eagle, may be allowed to Flutter like the
Spar∣row.</P>
<P>The Scripture is every where full of Variety, like a Garment of
several Co∣lours, and upon the same Loom of Ho∣ly Writ, divers Workmen may
accord∣ing to their several Fancies draw out some curious Threds of
Observation; and that Brain is very unhappy that meets not with some
traverse of Dis∣course more than it hath borrow'd from another's Pen; yet
I will not contemn the Judgment of the Wise, nor refuse to learn from any
Instructor. I never read but of one foolish Cock that refu∣sed a Pearl
tho' found on a Dunghill: 
<Q> 
<L>Mens assueta operi per mille volumina s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lers</L> 
<L>Ambulat, atque suos aliquid se ponit in usus.</L></Q></P>
<P>The laborious Bee is the Emblem of a working Brain, which Creature
is set <PB N="130" REF="169"/> before us for a Copy of Industry; it is not
always droning upon one Flower, but throws her light aiery Body upon a
second, so to a third, till her Thighs are loaded with a large Collection.
It is no less indeed than a wonder, that of almost the Shadow rather than
the Sub∣stance of so very small a living Creature, Nature hath made so
incomparable a Thing. I had rather imitate this labo∣rious Insect, than
challenge to my self <HI>Arachne</HI>'s Motto, <HI>Mihi soli debeo.</HI> I
had rather bind up in this Posie, some choice Flowers, which I have here
and there chosen and cull'd from the Gar∣dens of several Authors, than
boast my self with that little <HI>Arabian,</HI> that I have eriscerated
my self, and spun a Web out of my own Bowels.</P>
<P>Having therefore imposed this Task upon my self, and finding
nothing more particularly described in the New Testa∣ment, than several
remarkable Passages of the happy St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> I have
thereupon thought fit to make her the principal Subject of this Discourse,
add∣ing some Reflections upon the Conver∣sion of the Good Thief, and upon
what happen'd to St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> in the Pharisee's House, what
afterwards in her own, and her Sister <HI>Martha</HI>'s, and 
<PB N="131" REF="170"/> what after Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Death and Resur∣rection.</P>
<P>Who this Woman was is much con∣troverted, and is sooner
question'd than answer'd: I know such Problematical Disquisitions,
which have more Subtilty than Usefulness, (as <HI>Erasmus</HI> on this
ve∣ry <HI>Quaere</HI> says) are superfluous; and of them we may say, as
the Philosopher did of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Shops, <HI>How many Things are
here which we need not:</HI> And there∣fore I shall omit these
Disquisitions, and will not be curious where the Scripture is silent:
Whosoever she was, she still carries the Name of what for some time
she was, <HI>A Woman that was a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>We commonly see some artificial Pi∣ctures, which according to
divers Sights and Aspects, represent divers Things; such an admirable
Peice, with a double Resemblance, hath St. <HI>Luke</HI> (an excel∣lent
Painter) here delineated in the most lively Colours. Look on one side, You
shall see a lascivious Woman offering her self to Sale in the most
tempting Man∣ner; step on the other side, You may behold an admirable
Convert, attended with a Retinue of Graces: View it which way you will, here is
the word, <HI>Ecce,</HI> Behold, like a Curtain before some exact Piece of
Workmanship, which likewise <PB N="132" REF="171"/> hath a double Reference
to the Power of Christ who drew this Sinner, and to his Mercy who receiv'd
her.</P>
<P>In this noble History are several weigh∣ty Circumstances like
so many Wedges of Gold in a rich Mineral, and one In∣got appears at the Head
of the Mine, <HI>Behold a Woman,</HI> which is a Word of Emphasis and Energy,
and if this Star stand over the House, a <HI>Jesus</HI> is within: Here,
like <HI>Janus,</HI> it looks backward and forward; and so I shall
discourse of this Woman both as a Sinner, and as a Pe∣nitent. And if it
shall seem distastful, that I insist a little longer than perhaps
the Reader may judge necessary on the particular Sin, for which this Woman
was publickly noted, let me put him in Mind of the Answer which the Comic
Poet gave, who being accus'd of having brought a Lewd debauch'd Ruffian up∣on
the Stage, and so setting a bad Ex∣ample to young Men: <HI>'Tis true,</HI>
says he, <HI>I brought such a Man on, but I hang'd him before he went off,
and so I gave them a good Example.</HI> Here is a better Les∣son to be
learn'd: All Women may ac∣cept this Woman as a Pattern to imitate, and even the
best may learn somewhat from her Story. For how sinful soever she may
appear at first, let us suspend <PB N="133" REF="172"/> our Censure till
the last Act, then we shall find how she became <HI>à

lebéte, phi∣ala,</HI> of a Caldron boiling with Lust, a Chrystall
Vial of pure Chastity; how she that at first was running apace into the
<HI>Dead Sea,</HI> did speedily turn into the Path to
<HI>Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>I shall begin with her Fall, and con∣sider her first as a
Sinner.</P>
<P>But alas! who is not so? Had she not been a Sinner she had
been a Miracle; he that knows himself to be a Man, knows himself to be a
Sinner, for in the Loyns of our first Parents we all sinned; so that it
is absurd to suppose a Separation of Sin from Man's Nature: In our
Conceptions thro' that Original Pollution, we are all warm'd in unclean Blood,
and still we continue <HI>ponere Adam super Adam,</HI> to add new Sin to
our Ori∣ginal Sin: This Hereditary Poison is in∣bred in every Man, and the
Sullage of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Clay sticks fast to us: By <HI>Adam</HI>'s
sinning all his Seed are become sinful, and all his Off-spring, as in a
continued Line, do like corrupted Branches of a rotten Tree, still bring
forth corrupted Fruits.</P>
<P>The most perfect and glorious Light in the World is the Sun in the
Firma∣ment, yet hath he his Paralax, and his <PB N="134" REF="173"/> Variation:
And what Son of <HI>Adam</HI> was ever found, thro' the Zodiack of whose Life
an Ecliptick could not be drawn? A Man without Sin is like the Mountain of
Gold, or the Philosopher's Stone, which have no Existance but in Theory and
the Operation of the Understanding. In Scholastical Speculations you will
hear the Noise of such a Being, but you shall no sooner find him than
the Eccho in the Poet, <HI>Quem non invenis usquam, esse putas
nusquam:</HI> Such Utopical Perfe∣ction is only an idle Dream of the
Do∣natists. It is the Voice of an Apostle, <HI>In many Things we offend
all.</HI> Nothing more certain, than that Corruption has deep Root in God's
peculiar People: Even their best Works (and they too like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Sculpture, <HI>a little upon a Pillar rare and few</HI>) will but weigh light
in the Scales of the Sanctuary. As the Curtezan <HI>Lais</HI> said,
<HI>Philosophers did sometimes knock at her Gates, as well as other
Men</HI>; so the best Men are often overtaken by human Frailties; let the
best do what they can, they are but im∣perfectly Good, in some Matter or
other they step aside from God's Commands. It is a Truth as clear as the
Sun, that the Seeds of Sin are in all Men, the Seeds not the Practice; there is
not in <PB N="135" REF="174"/> all the same Eruption, but there is in all the
same Corruption. Some are Kytes, others Hawks, and the rest Eagles, and yet
all from the same Eyrie; he that bears Humanity about him, he that's cloathed
with Flesh and Blood, cannot but Sin: And yet tho' we cannot avoid being
Tempted, yet we may shun the Commission of Sin. It is one Thing to dart
and glance a wanton Desire, and another to court and plead for it. Tho' the
Motions of Flesh be alike in all Men, yet the humouring those Motions is
not so. It is one Thing for a Man to Sin, another to give himself over to
the Com∣mission of Sin. This continuance in any notorious Sin, is not only
a Grave to the Soul, but a great Stone rolled to the Mouth thereof to keep it
down.</P>
<P>What <HI>Erasmus</HI> says of <HI>Paris, That after a Man hath
used himself to the odious Scent of it, it grows more and more agreeable to
him,</HI> is too true of Sin, which by long Entertainment be∣comes Customary,
and not easie to be dismiss'd.</P>
<P>We know that an expert Swimmer, being under Water, feels not the
weight of a full freighted Ship of a thousand Tuns riding perpendicularly
over his Head; so whilst we swim in the Custom <PB N="136" REF="175"/>
of any pleasing Sin, we are insensible of the Burthen of it; for
frequency of Sin doth flesh us in Immodesty, assiduity in Impudence,
and that Sin is almost in∣curable that is steel'd by Custom; which is a
true Character given of this Wo∣man, who is not described as a Woman who had
sinned, but <HI>a Woman that was a Sinner</HI>; it was not a transient, but
a permanent Condition, that gave her that Denomination, her long continuance in
her Trade had branded her with this Title, <HI>A Woman that was a
Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>This Woman was of a Noble Descent, and (as is generally receiv'd)
was re∣markable for a luxurious and inconti∣nent Life; and in those loose
Days, wherein <HI>Herod</HI> erected his Theaters and Amphitheaters, Debauchery
was very much encouraged. And however Wan∣tons may flatter themselves, and
take that for true Doctrine, which the un∣wise Tutor sometime spoke in
the Comedy, <HI>Non est crede mihi, adoles∣centi; It is no such Fault in
a young Man to follow Harlots</HI>; yet it is such a Sin, as commonly drives
to the Devil at once, a Sin which once indulged be∣comes what may be call'd a
pleasant Madness.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="176"/>History tells us of a certain Well in
<HI>Epirus</HI> that will quench Firebrands if put into it, and yet when they
are quenched it will presently set them on Fire again: Like this Water is a
lasci∣vious Woman, when she quencheth the Lust of the Body for a time,
she setteth it on Fire afterwards much more witti∣ly: Therefore
<HI>Fonseca</HI> the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath Emblem'd this Vice by the
Phoe∣nix, which does revive and renew her self by the Fire which she
kindles by the Motion of her Wings. Thus we mourn perhaps, and bewail, and
repent, of the Sin we have committed, and desire to give it over, that it may
Die with us, but with the Wings of our Thoughts we blow those Coals afresh,
and make them Flame more than be∣fore.</P>
<P>Thus we walk the Round, first we act a Sin because the Thought
pleases us, then we think that Sin over again, because the Act hath pleas'd
us; and amongst the great variety of Sins, there is none more plausible,
nor more plea∣sing to Nature than Wantonness: How many set their Souls
burning in the Flames thereof, and (as <HI>Nero</HI> did when he had set
<HI>Rome</HI> on Fire) behold them with Transport and Delight? How 
<PB N="138" REF="177"/> many silly Wretches, like the foolish Lark, whilst
it playeth with the Fea∣ther, and stoopeth to the Glass, are caught in the
Fowler's Net? For a lascivious Woman (to give a short but true Character of
her) is the Devil's Pitfall, a Trap to catch our Souls: Her Eyes, like free
Doctors, live upon the spoil of Stragglers; she baits her De∣sires with a
Million of prostituted Coun∣tenances, her display'd Breasts, and loose
Glances, Locks wantonly waving over her Shoulders, her artificial Complecti∣on,
(the Counterfeit of the Great Seal of Nature) her curl'd Hair, (the
Sophi∣stry of the old cunning Serpent) her high Washes and Paintings are
so many Lures to bring the Adulterer to the Snare.</P>
<P>But chaste Thoughts will check and never stoop to such
Enticements; For when Fire falleth on Fuel that is wet it presently goeth
out.</P>
<P>When <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s Wife, one of the greatest Ladies in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> did inordi∣nately affect, impudently sollicit, and, in a
manner, force the Modesty of her good Servant <HI>Joseph,</HI> how much
rather did he leave his Garment than his Vir∣tue? Nor did he rescue himself
from Adultery and Danger by Violence to her <PB N="139" REF="178"/> Person,
nor neglect the Duties he owed her as a Servant, but with the hazard of his
Name, Life and Liberty, he made an innocent Escape to preserve his bet∣ter
Garment of Chastity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabian</HI> Proverb is elegant, <HI>Ob∣strue quinque
fenestras ut luceat domus, Shut the five Windows that the House may be
lightsome</HI>; cleanse the Limbeck of the Senses, least thence some
Polluti∣on drop into the Soul. If at once we would overcome the Temptation and
the Tempter, we must resolve, with <HI>Alipius,</HI> to shut our Eyes
when we come amongst Vanities; for the Eye is the first Part that is
struck in such Engage∣ments, upon the first Assault it yields up our
strongest Fort: The <HI>Eye</HI> besides is the vainest of all the
Senses, it takes ex∣tream Delight to be cheated; one of the Pleasures of
the Eye is the Decep∣tion of it, and how easie is that Sense deluded which
delights to be deceived.</P>
<P>The antient Philosophers before <HI>A∣ristotle,</HI> that held
Vision to be perform'd by an Emission of Beams, imagin'd the Eye to be of
a fiery Nature, wherein they were confirm'd by observing, if the Eye had a
Blow, Fire seems to spar∣kle out of it: But certainly, how watry soever
better Experience hath found the <PB N="140" REF="179"/> Substance of the Eye,
it is <HI>spiritually fiery,</HI> both actively and passively;
pas∣sively for that it is inflamed by every wanton Beam, actively it sets
the whole Heart on Fire with the inordinate Flames of Concupisence: Thus
<HI>Sichem</HI> saw <HI>Di∣nah</HI> and defiled her; <HI>Viderunt Oculi,
ra∣puerant pectora flammoe,</HI> no sooner did he see her than his Breast
was inflam'd with <HI>Lust.</HI> Thus <HI>Amon</HI> fell sick for
<HI>Tamar</HI>'s Sake, his Desire of her began at the first Interview. Thus
when <HI>David</HI> walked upon the Roof of his Palace, and dis∣covered from
thence a beautiful Woman washing her self; here was <HI>Mulier
longè, libido prope,</HI> for his petulant Eye recoil'd upon his Heart,
and smote him with vitious Desires. Yet it is not the <HI>Eye</HI> it
self, (for what is that but the Beauty of the Face, the bright Star of the
Orb it moves in) but the Viciousness of the <HI>Eye</HI> that is to be
condemned; when we talk with our Eyes, then 'tis that we sin with them. But I
dare not inlarge up∣on this Subject for fear of committing that which was a
noted Fault in <HI>Marcel∣lus</HI> the Rhetorition, (as <HI>Suetonius</HI>
tells us) that lighting on a Figure he would pursue it till he forgot the
Matter in hand; I will therefore return to discourse more particularly of
this <HI>Woman,</HI> so sin∣ful <PB N="141" REF="180"/> in her Life, so
hateful for her Lust, and so devoted to Incontinence, that she was become
a common Scandal: For by her bad Example she made the City so infamous,
that she might more fitly be call'd, <HI>peccatum Hierosolymae quam
peccatrix,</HI> the Sin of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> rather than a Sinner in
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as <HI>Petrus Chrysologus</HI> observes, because
the whole City shar'd the Disgrace which she de∣serv'd.</P>
<P>Sin is Sin wherever committed, whe∣ther before a Multitude, or in a
Desart; yet the more publick the Fact is, the greater is the Scandal, and
this Woman's Offence was the more notorious, be∣cause she was a <HI>City
Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>I confess that no Place can secure one from Temptations, which
come in too hastily and uninvited, like rough Winds from every Corner of the
Sky, and in such Number, as if each Minute were computed by them.</P>
<P>We are apt to Fall, because we are Mutable, but we do not commonly
Fall except some Occasion be given; and how full is the World of such
Occasions? Our common Adversary, the <HI>Devil</HI> (who has a thousand
Ways of attacking us) finds how apt we are to stumble at something or other
in our way: He <PB N="142" REF="181"/> knows which way our corrupted Na∣ture
bends, he sifteth out what will work upon our Affections and
Disposi∣tions, and with that he wooes our Con∣sent to Sin; like a skilful
Sailor he marks the Wind, and accordingly hoisteth up or striketh Sail; or,
like a cunning Poet, he gives every Actor a Part agreeable, and makes a
perpetual Use of the Bent of our Nature: Thus hath he a Wedge of Gold for
covetous <HI>Achan,</HI> a Crown for ambitious <HI>Absalom,</HI> and a
<HI>Dinah</HI> for <HI>Sichem.</HI> And the Concurrence of Time and Place are
his principal Engines, which serve to give Aim to such Faults as our Nature
is too apt to commit with∣out a Prompter; then surely in a cor∣rupt debauched
<HI>City</HI> are more Invitati∣ons to Sin, than in private Cells. In a large
Concourse of People you'll find many Brokers of Villany, who live up∣on the
Spoil of the unthinking Part of Mankind. Where many Pots are boil∣ing there
must needs be much <HI>Scum</HI>; where Multitudes of Strangers meet, where
Variety of Delights entertain the Eye, it is more difficult to avoid
Tem∣ptations, for our Nature herein is like Fire, which, if there be any
Infection in the Room, draws it to its self, or like Jeat, which, omitting
all more noble <PB N="143" REF="182"/> and precious things, attracts only Straws
and Dirt.</P>
<P>It was in a <HI>City</HI> where this Woman liv'd, where by her lewd
Example she drew in others to offend, and her Ex∣ample was more prejudicial
because she was of a good Family: <HI>Satan</HI>'s Infecti∣ons many times
send their Influence through some great Star into lesser Bo∣dies, for
Example is like a Stone thrown into a Pond, which makes Cir∣cles which dilate
themselves till they are stopped by the Banks; or like a Plague-sore
which infects the By-standers and Lookers on.</P>
<P>I do not find the Name of the City set down, yet many are bold to
affirm it was <HI>Naim,</HI> others will have it <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>;
where-ever she liv'd she was too well known in her Time, and having
al∣ready shew'd what her Offence was, I will not lay my Finger again upon
that Blot; and having thus far drawn the black Lines of her Life, I will now
look on the other Part, and consider her as she hath put off the
<HI>Sinner,</HI> and as she is now become a <HI>Penitent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scipio</HI> (as <HI>Livy</HI> says) never look'd so fresh,
nor appeared so lovely to the Eyes of his Soldiers, as after his Recovery
from a dangerous Sickness in the Camp; so <PB N="144" REF="183"/> neither
does the <HI>Soul</HI> ever seem more beautiful than when she is restor'd
to Health after some dangerous Conflict. The <HI>Palladium</HI> was very much
esteem'd by both <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>Graecians,</HI> not so much for
the Matter or Workmanship, as because it was snatch'd out of the Flames
of <HI>Troy</HI>; so no Soul is more pre∣cious in the Sight of <HI>God</HI>
and his <HI>Angels</HI> than that which is snatched out of the Fire of Hell,
and Jaws of Death.</P>
<P>To see Men turning from God to the World, from Piety to
Prophaness, is as common as lamentable, every Day's Ex∣perience shews us
such Sights. But to see Men return to God, is as happy as wondrous to
<HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Angels</HI>; and what is more strange, we see the
first Disciples that came to <HI>Christ</HI> were such as were most
desperately enthrall'd to <HI>Satan.</HI> The <HI>Magi, Publicans,</HI>
Harlots, the Thief, the Blasphemer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This shews the Depth
of <HI>Christ</HI>'s unspeakable Mercy; who of the knottiest and most
crooked Timber can make Rafters and Cielings for his own House: Thus he can
call a <HI>Zachaeus</HI> from a <HI>Toll-booth</HI> to be a
<HI>Disciple,</HI> and <HI>Mathew</HI> to be an <HI>A∣postle,</HI> and this
sinful Woman to be a Con∣vert; who it seems came to <HI>Jesus</HI> in
<HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Pharisee</HI>'s House, who had invited Christ to
eat with him.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="184"/>She came not (as the staring Multi∣tude) to
glut her Eyes with the Sight of a Miracle and his glorious Person, nor (as
did the Centurion or the <HI>Syro∣phenitian Woman,</HI> or the Ruler of the
Synagogue) for Cure of her Sickness, or in behalf of her Friend, or Child, or
Servant, but (the only Example of this sort of coming) came for a Cure not of
any bodily Grief or Malady, but for her Sins. She came with Remorse and
Re∣gret for them, to lay her Burthen at <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s Feet, to present
him with a broken and penitent Heart, a weeping Eye and great Affliction; for
she came humbling her self, and fell down before him weep∣ing bitterly for
her Sins, pouring out a Flood of Tears large enough to wash the Feet of
<HI>Jesus,</HI> which she wip'd with the Hairs of her Head.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Purgata recessit</L> 
<L>Per gemitum propriique lavans in gur∣gite fletûs</L> 
<L>Munda suis lacrymis redit &amp; detersa ca∣pillis.</L></Q>
<P>But amongst all the Demonstrations of God's Mercy, we can never
enough magnifie his Goodness and Power in the Conversion of the dying
Thief, who was execrable amongst Men, and a Blasphe∣mer 
<PB N="146" REF="185"/> of God: My Soul is lost in Amaze∣ment when I think of
him; the Of∣fender came to die, nothing was in his Thoughts but his Guilt and
Torment: <HI>Christ</HI> was silent when he revil'd him, and being yet in
his Blood, <HI>Christ</HI> said, <HI>this Soul shall live</HI>; his good
Spirit so breath'd upon him, and the Force of his Grace work'd so
instantly and pow∣erfully, that his last Hour was his first, wherein he
knew his <HI>Saviour</HI> to be God. <HI>In ipso Crucis candelabro Sol
resplenduit: The Sun did shine upon him from the Can∣dlestick of the
Cross:</HI> The Light where∣of was so powerful, that it awakned this
drowsie sleeping Thief, leaving him so well instructed, that he
presently burns with a zealous Impatience; he cannot hear the Revilings of
his Companion, but suddenly he becomes a Convert, chiding his
Fellow-sufferer, saying, <HI>Doest not thou fear God, seeing thou art
in the same Condemnation.</HI> He confesses his Sins, <HI>We receive the
just Rewards of our Deeds, But this Man hath done nothing amiss</HI>;
wherein he shews himself a Do∣ctor to preach; and lastly he becomes a
<HI>Martyr</HI> praying, <HI>Lord remember me when thou comest into thy
Kingdom:</HI> He that before had in his Eye nothing but present Death, is now
lifted above his Cross, in a blessed Ambition, <HI>Lord remem∣ber</HI> 
<PB N="147" REF="186"/> <HI>me when thou comst into thy Kingdom.</HI> Is this
the Voice of a <HI>Thief</HI> or of a <HI>Disciple? Dic ô Latro, ubi
Thronus ex Saphyro, ubi Cherubin, &amp; exercitus coeli, ubi Co∣rona, Sceptrum
&amp; purpura, ut Eum dicas Regem.</HI> Tell me, O Thief, what in∣duc'd thee to
stile him <HI>King.</HI> Where is his Throne? Where are the <HI>Cherubin</HI>
and the whole Host of Heaven? Seest thou any other <HI>Crown</HI> than that
of <HI>Thorus,</HI> any other <HI>Scepter</HI> than strong <HI>Iron
Nails</HI> driven up to the Head through the Palms of those blessed
Hands, any other <HI>Purple</HI> but his <HI>Blood,</HI> any other
<HI>Throne</HI> but his <HI>Cross</HI>? What dost thou see that can
persuade thee to call him King? O Faith greater than Death! that can look
beyond a <HI>Cross</HI> at a <HI>Crown,</HI> beyond <HI>Dissolution</HI>
at a Remembrance of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI>; as no Disciple could be
more faithful, so no Saint could be more hap∣py; <HI>Nam juxta fluenta
plenissimae grati∣am simul accepit &amp; gloriam; For Grace and Glory
with a full Tide both at once came flowing in upon him.</HI> The Reward every
way out-weighed the Request, <HI>Magis velox erat praemium quàm
petitio, &amp; ubetior gratia quam precatio; It was a greater Favour</HI>
(saith St. <HI>Leo</HI>) <HI>to put this so discreet and humble a
Petition into this Thief's Heart, but a much greater Favour to give him so
good and quick a</HI> <PB N="148" REF="187"/> <HI>Dispatch.</HI> St.
<HI>Cyprian</HI> says, <HI>Quid tu Domine Stephano amplius contulisti.</HI>
What could the <HI>Martyr</HI> St. <HI>Stephen</HI> en∣joy more, or that
beloved Disciple that lean'd on <HI>Christ</HI>'s Bosom? Or what could
the long Services of those that en∣dur'd the Heat of the Day obtain more at
God's Hands? But God gives them this Answer, <HI>I do thee no Wrong, didst
not thou agree with me for a Penny.</HI></P>
<P>Some Labourers were working hard in the Vineyard from the
<HI>first</HI> Hour, others from the <HI>third,</HI> others began at the
<HI>ninth</HI> when the Sun was setting; first came <HI>Adam,</HI> then
<HI>Noah,</HI> after him <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> and the rest of the Holy
<HI>Pro∣phets</HI>; but this <HI>Thief</HI> came at the Sun-setting, and he
that in the Morning was on his way towards <HI>Hell,</HI> is in the Even∣ing
with his Lord in <HI>Paradise.</HI> For no sooner had he cried, <HI>Lord
remember,</HI> but <HI>Christ</HI> answers him immediately, <HI>I say
unto thee,</HI> and promises <HI>thou shalt,</HI> and seals that
Promise with a Verily, and promises more than is asked, and that soon,
<HI>Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt this Day be with me in
Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>So soon as <HI>Christ</HI> afforded this <HI>Thief</HI> any
Call, he came; and yet this Thief's Conversion is become a Proverb, and
satisfies and serves a Sinner in all Cases of a late and Death-bed
Repentance; <PB N="149" REF="188"/> But they that urge him as a Precedent, ought
to consider that this <HI>Thief</HI> was not converted at <HI>last,</HI>
but at <HI>first</HI>; and when we can find out such another Day, we may
expect such another Mercy, a Day that open'd the Graves of the Dead, a Day
that divided the Veil of the Tem∣ple it self, a Day which the <HI>Sun</HI>
durst not see, a Day that saw the Soul of God (if I may so say,
seeing that <HI>God</HI> was <HI>Man</HI> too) depart from <HI>Man</HI>;
there shall be no more such Days, and therefore we must not presume
upon such Mercy.</P>
<P>To the Chief of the Apostles, St. <HI>Peter, Christ</HI> says,
<HI>Whither I go thou can'st not come</HI>; but to this <HI>Thief,</HI> he
says, <HI>This Day thou shalt be with me in Para∣dise.</HI> So soon did
<HI>Christ</HI> bring this Thief to that height of Faith, that e∣ven in that
low Estate upon the <HI>Cross,</HI> he pray'd for a <HI>Spiritual
Kingdom</HI>; whereas the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves (whom
<HI>Christ</HI> had estated in <HI>Heaven,</HI> and had given them
Reversions of judiciary Places, twelve Seats to judge the twelve Tribes) yet
in that Exaltation, when <HI>Christ</HI> was ascending, they talked to him
of a Temporal Kingdom. <HI>Sic fa∣cit fides innocentem latronem facit
infide∣litas Apostolos criminosos. Christ</HI> in∣fused so much Faith
into this <HI>Thief</HI> <PB N="150" REF="189"/> as justify'd him, and leaves
the <HI>Apostles</HI> so far to their Infirmities as endangers them.</P>
<P>This <HI>Thief</HI> came to know those Wounds that were in
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Body were his own Wounds in the Body of his
<HI>Saviour,</HI> so he came to declare per∣fect Faith in professing
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Inno∣cence, perfect Hope in the <HI>memento mei,</HI> and
perfect Charity in rebuking his Companion: He was such a <HI>Thief</HI> as
deserved Praise and Wonder, who had a good Bargain of Death, and was the
better and longer lived for being Hang∣ed, for he was thereby made Partaker of
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Martyrdom and Kingdom: And this <HI>Thief</HI> hath done
nothing but what we may all do, if we will lay hold on that Grace as he did:
<HI>Assumemus vocem latronis, si nolumus esse latrones, ut sedeamus
à Dextris, pendeamus à Dextris:</HI> Let us be content to
suffer, but suffer in the Right, suffering as a Malefactor is somewhat
too much on the Left Hand; and yet even that Suffering does bring many to the
Right Hand, being joyned with a true and hearty Re∣pentance, which is as a City
of Refuge to fly unto, it is the happy Plank that has sav'd many a
<HI>Soul</HI> from the <HI>Gulph</HI> of De∣spair, the Board which after
Shipwrack <PB N="151" REF="190"/> will carry us safe unto Land; and it is not
ill compared to a <HI>Phaenix</HI>'s Nest, wherein the <HI>Old Adam</HI> is
consum'd to Ashes, out of which arises a new Man of God; for Conversion
is a Sacred Rid∣dle, wherein when we are Born, we are Buried; and when we are
quicken'd we are kill'd, and when we are mortified we are rais'd. Thus
<HI>Nineve</HI> was over∣thrown and yet not overthrown, it was overthrown by
Sin, and built again by Repentance. He that is a skillful Peni∣tent does
cunningly play this After-game, and a Sinner after his Recovery for the most
part seeks <HI>God</HI> more fervently, and is more fearful of Relapsing,
than be∣fore of Sinning; like wild Beasts break∣ing from their Toils, they
are more cau∣tious for the future, and the <HI>Saints</HI> come out of the Bed
of their Sins, as <HI>Heze∣kiah</HI> did out of his sick Bed, more Hum∣ble,
more Holy, more Penitent; as the <HI>Eagle</HI> that is weary'd, comes out of
the Water, into which she has dip'd her Wings, with a more towering Ascent
towards <HI>Heaven</HI> than ever. <HI>Dum pete∣ret Regem,</HI> says
<HI>Martial,</HI> when <HI>Mutius Scaevola</HI> missed his Aim, and
instead of killing <HI>Porsenna,</HI> slew one of his Secre∣taries by
mistake, he presently offer'd that Hand which gave the Blow as a 
<PB N="152" REF="191"/> willing Sacrifice to the Flame, which Hand grew famous
for being deceiv'd; and it had been less Reputation to have struck his
Enemy to the Heart, than to punish it so stoutly for missing its Aim;
upon which the Poet took Occasion to say, 
<Q> 
<L>Major deceptae fama est &amp; gloria dextrae,</L> 
<L>Si non errasset, fecerat illa minus.</L></Q> Without any
change, I may apply it to <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Conversion: 
<Q>Si non peccasset fecerat illa minus.</Q> She would not have
been so famous, had she not sinn'd; neither is this a Parodox; for what
an Enemy would upbraid by way of Reproach, is the greatest Praise that can
be; their very Sins do honour some, as the <HI>Devils</HI> did <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> who are mention'd for her Glory, since we do not hear of them
until they were cast out; For Repentance is a <HI>Super∣cedeas</HI> that
dischargeth Sin, making <HI>God</HI> to be merciful, <HI>Angels</HI> to be
joyful, and <HI>Man</HI> to be acceptable: And as St. <HI>Austin</HI>
affirms, <HI>It is a greater Deliverance, a mightier Miracle, and a bigger
Grace, that a Sinner should be Converted, than</HI> <PB N="153" REF="192"/>
<HI>that being converted he should after∣wards be saved:</HI> Here we see
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> being now touch'd with Re∣pentance for her former Sins
and Vani∣ties, like the thirsty and panting Hart in the extremity of Heat,
does eagerly long for the cooling Springs Her Soul was deeply wounded with the
sting of her Sins, it stuck so fast that she could not get it out,
therefore with the woun∣ded Deer she comes to the Soveraign <HI>Dittany</HI>
to expel it; the Pool of her Conscience was troubled, and with the
descending Angel instantly she steps in for a Cure; for <HI>ut cognovit
venit,</HI> as soon as she knew where <HI>Jesus</HI> was, she makes
haste to him; And the Zeal with which she approacheth <HI>Christ</HI> is
very remark∣able. <HI>Christ</HI> was at Dinner in a Pharisee's House,
where we may observe by the way, that <HI>Christ</HI> frequented Feasts,
and we do not find he was ever invited to any Table and refus'd it; if a
Pharisee or a Publican invited him, he made no difficulty to go, the end of
his going in∣deed was not to Eat, but to gain Souls to God, and to fulfill the
Will of his Father, which was his <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink:</HI> And at
whose Table did <HI>Jesus</HI> ever Eat, and left not the <HI>Host</HI> a
Gainer? When <HI>Zachaeus</HI> entertain'd him, Salvation came 
<PB N="154" REF="193"/> that Day to his House, with the Author of it; and now
when this Pharisee en∣tertain'd him, his Table was honour'd with the publick
Remission of a Penitent Sinner. But how comes this Woman to thrust her
self into this Pharisee's House? Certainly great was her Faith, since
no Disadvantage could affright her from coming to <HI>Jesus,</HI> not the
Frowns, nor the Censure of a rigid Host, who darted from his Eyes Disdain
and Scorn, seeing so notorious a <HI>Strumpet</HI> come to the Upper
Chamber where he entertain'd his Company, and that too in <HI>Christ</HI>'s
Presence, who knew her wicked Life, and (no doubt) was offended at her
Action. A <HI>Pharisee</HI>'s House might have seem'd indeed an unlikely
Place to find a <HI>Saviour</HI> in, and it was very improper to serve in
Tears at a Banquet: Certainly the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> mov'd on the Waters:
Doubtless this Woman had heard from our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Lips, in his
Heavenly Ser∣mons, many gracious Invitations of all distress'd and
sin-burthen'd Souls, and now at length she was entangl'd in the Net of his
Heavenly Doctrine: For our <HI>Saviour</HI> (as St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI>
says) hath two sorts of Nets, a one of Wonders, ano∣ther of Words; in the
former of these he caught those many that believ'd on <PB N="155" REF="194"/> his Name; by the latter he inclos'd his very Enemies, even those
very Officers that were sent to apprehend him, and bring him before the
<HI>High Priest</HI>; and still doth our Blessed Saviour spin out the
Thread of his Love, to an infinite Length, to try whether we will lay hold on
it. He doth angle for us, he sits in <HI>Heaven,</HI> lets down the Line of
his Love, and Baits it with his <HI>Mercy,</HI> to see whe∣ther we will
swallow it, that he may catch our Souls; with such a Hook was this Woman
taken, she had treasur'd up his Sayings in her Memory, she had
ob∣serv'd that he not only pardon'd Sinners, but receiv'd them into his
Presence, she had observ'd the Passages of his Power and Mercy, and a
deep Remorse wrought in her self, for her mispent Life; and surely, had
not the Spirit of God wrought upon her, ere she came, she had neither
sought nor found <HI>Christ.</HI> For those good Graces which
<HI>God</HI> finds in us, are like the Silver which <HI>Joseph</HI> found in
<HI>Ben∣jamin</HI>'s Sack, of his own putting in. If his Hand does not move the
golden <HI>Cym∣bal,</HI> it will give no pleasant Sound, for our Will herein
is like a lower Sphere, which receives its Motions from some first Mover.
And we may believe, the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> first breath'd, and then that 
<PB N="156" REF="195"/> Blast begat the Shower of Tears which <HI>Mary</HI>
pour'd out; for first; Thus she be∣ing first mov'd by the <HI>Spirit of
God,</HI> comes in and finds <HI>Christ</HI> whom she sought; she comes
into his Presence not empty handed, but with a precious Con∣fection of
<HI>Ointment</HI> of <HI>Nardus,</HI> the chief of all Ointments, which she
intended to bestow; this delicate odoriferous Per∣fume, she brings in as
rich a Vessel, a <HI>Box of Alablaster</HI>; she used likewise a
good <HI>Decorum,</HI> she did not presently pour out her Ointment upon the
Feet of <HI>Jesus</HI>; but (observing a decent Or∣der in her Repentance,
and in this her laudable Action) first she gives the Sa∣crifice of a broken
Heart, she stood be∣hind at <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Feet, her Eyes
suffici∣ently testified her godly Sorrow, which dropp'd down Tears as
fast as the <HI>Ara∣bian</HI> Trees their medicinal Gums: She wept so
plentifully, that with those Streams of Penitence she began to wash his
Feet, and did wipe them with the Hairs of her Head, to shew her Abje∣ction or
Neglect of her self: Thus cun∣ningly in Abasement of her self does this
humble Penitent, like the <HI>Syrophe∣nitian</HI> Woman, like a Dog, lick her
Master's Feet; at the Feet of <HI>Christ</HI> she makes a general
Sacrifice of all those <PB N="157" REF="196"/> Things wherewith she had
offended him: <HI>Quot habuit in se oblectamenta, tot de se fecit
Holocausta.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>Peccavit meretrix oculis, labrisque, co∣misque,</L> 
<L>Inde luunt crimen lumina, labra, comae.</L></Q>
<P>Her Eyes, her Lips, her Hair, her Ointment, all the Instruments of
her Sin, were turn'd at her Conversion into the Means of Life; as the
<HI>Israelites</HI> that gave their Jewels to the making of a <HI>Calf,</HI>
did afterwards bestow them upon the <HI>Lord's</HI> Tabernacle; such was
this Woman's Practice, who having now ta∣ken leave of her former Vanities, and
disrob'd her self of all her rich Orna∣ments, does, like an excellent
<HI>Apothe∣cary,</HI> that knows how to mix his Me∣dicines, make a most
soveraign <HI>Antidote</HI> out of a most deadly <HI>Poison.</HI></P>
<P>She used to send forth her alluring Beams into the Eyes of the
lascivious <HI>Paramours,</HI> therefore from her Eyes flow a Deluge of
Tears, shallow enough to bear the Ark of her Sorrow; she had made her Lips
the Incitements to Lust, and Inlets to Vanity, but now they san∣ctifie
themselves with their Respect to the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God</HI>; her
Hair, which she had <PB N="158" REF="197"/> so often curl'd at her Glass,
doth now serve for a Towel to dry his Feet; her odoriferous Perfume,
wherewith she used to make her self acceptable to her amorous Companions,
she bestows on those sacred Feet which her Eyes had watered, her Hair
dried, and her Mouth kissed. And this strange Circumstance of her
anointing was scarce done to any but <HI>Christ,</HI> nor to him but by
this Wo∣man: It was esteemed so great an Exta∣sie of Love and Adoration,
that to a∣noint the Feet even of the greatest <HI>Mo∣narch,</HI> was long
unknown in all the Pomps and Greatness of the <HI>Roman</HI> Pro∣digality. It
was not us'd (as <HI>Pliny</HI> says in his natural History) till
<HI>Otho</HI> taught it <HI>Nero,</HI> in whose Instance it was by
<HI>Pliny</HI> reckon'd for a Prodigy of unneces∣sary Profusion, and in
it self it was a Present for a <HI>Prince,</HI> and <HI>an Alablaster
Box</HI> of Nard Pistick was sent as a great Present from
<HI>Cambyses</HI> to the King of <HI>Aethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>But was the Oyntment so precious, and she so poor that she
could not bring a Napkin? certainly she wanted not fine Linnen to have dry'd
Christ's Feet with; but to shew her hearty Devotion, and sincere
Humility, her Shame, her Tears, her godly Sortow were not enough, she 
<PB N="159" REF="198"/> still seeks farther to make her self more vile,
and of no Price before <HI>Christ</HI>; she her self is the Servant that
waits on him; from her self do fall the Dews of Water that wash his Feet;
and as her Eyes were the <HI>Ewer,</HI> so her Hairs were the <HI>Towel,</HI>
using the chiefest Ornament of her Head in the meanest Office of our
Saviour's Feet; and thus she seems to climb up towards Heaven by the same
Rounds of that Ladder by which she was formerly going down to Hell.</P>
<P>When <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Pharisee</HI> observed this Woman
so busy in the Expression of her <HI>Religion</HI> and Veneration of
<HI>Jesus,</HI> he thought within himself, this was no <HI>Prophet</HI>
that did not know her to be a <HI>Sinner,</HI> and that would suffer her to
touch him. For altho' the <HI>Jews</HI> Reli∣gion did permit the Harlots of
their own Nation to live and enjoy all the Privileges of their Nation, except
only that their Oblations were refus'd: Yet the Pharisees (who pretended to a
greater Degree of Sanctity than others) would not permit them to civil
Usages, or Be∣nefits of ordinary Society, and thought Religion it self and
the Honour of a Prophet was concern'd in the same Su∣perstitiousness.
And therefore <HI>Simon</HI> made an Objection within himself, which 
<PB N="160" REF="199"/> <HI>Jesus</HI> knowing (who understood his Thoughts
as well as his Words) made an Apology for her and himself by a civil
Question, express'd by way of Pa∣rable of two Debtors, to whom a grea∣ter
and a smaller Debt respectively was forgiven, both of them concluding, that
they would love their merciful Creditor in Proportion to his Mercy; which was
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Case, who because she had much forgiven, loved
much, and express'd it in Characters so large, that the <HI>Pharisee</HI>
might read his own Inci∣vility and unhospitable Entertainment of the
<HI>Master,</HI> when it stood confron∣ted with the Magnificency of
<HI>Mary Mag∣dalen</HI>'s Charity and Penance, the last of which she
sufficiently express'd by her Tears.</P>
<P>Such is <HI>God</HI>'s Goodness, that he hath placed in the Eye
both the Disease and the Cure, the Faculty of Seeing, and the Sluce of
Tears, that they who of∣fend by Seeing, may be recover'd by Weeping.
<HI>Tears</HI> are the Favourites, that have the Ear of the <HI>King</HI> of
<HI>Hea∣ven</HI>; they are our Bills of <HI>Exchange</HI> which he allows, and
returns them with what Sums of Blessings we desire; so long as we pay
him this Type of our Devotion, so long is our Tenure safe, 
<PB N="161" REF="200"/> and our Title to his Goodness and Mercy
unquestionable.</P>
<P>This Soveraign Water will recal a Sinner to the Life of Grace, tho'
never so far gone. These heavenly Showers are the Streams of
<HI>Jordan</HI> which cure our <HI>Leprosie,</HI> the <HI>Silim</HI> to cure
our Blind∣ness, the <HI>Bethesda</HI> to heal our Lameness and Defects of
Obedience; never was the Poyson of any Sin so cold, but the Hand of
Repentance could thaw it; never was the Flame of any Sin so hot, but the
Tears of Repentance could cool it: <HI>Magis frugiferae Lacrymantes
vineae.</HI> The bleeding Heart, like the dropping Vine, is for the most Part
fruitful. I cannot here express my Thoughts of <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Tears
in a better Strain than that of the Poet. 
<Q> 
<L>Magdala, dum tristi vitiorum compede vincta,</L> 
<L>Solvendam Domini se jacet ante pedes</L> 
<L>Quàm dulces fundit lacrymas! quàm nobile

<L>Nascitur ex oculi divise fonte sui!</L> 
<L>Pactolus tali se vellet origire nasci,</L> 
<L>Vellet &amp; auriferi nobilis unda Tagi.</L> 
<L>Illi etenim solum voluunt sub fluctibus aurum:</L> 
<L>At fluit ex oculis plurima gemma suis.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="201"/>Her Ointment indeed was precious, but her
Tears were more so, her Tears were her best Advocates to plead for Mercy at
the Throne of Grace: <HI>Inter∣dum lacrymae pondera vocis habent:</HI> For
sometimes Tears have as much Force as Words. She spake not, for she knew
she was before one who knew the most retir'd Thoughts, and most private
De∣sires of her Soul; what need her Tongue speak, when her <HI>Eyes,</HI>
her <HI>Hands,</HI> her <HI>Gesture,</HI> her <HI>Countenance,</HI> and her
whole <HI>Behaviour,</HI> spoke her Desires.</P>
<P>Amongst other Things observable in the greater and more solemn
Feasts of the <HI>Jews,</HI> there were some <HI>Ceremonies</HI> used by
them as Preparations to their Feasts, which <HI>Josephus</HI> tells us were
<HI>Three. First,</HI> Their <HI>Salutation,</HI> which was shewn either by
Words, or some humble Posture of the Body, sometimes by Prostrating
their whole Body, some∣times by Kissing the Feet, as in this
Pas∣sage, and commonly by an ordinary Kiss of the Cheek, as a Pledge of
their wel∣come to their Guest. The <HI>Second</HI> was the Washing of their
Feet before they sat down to Eat. The <HI>Third</HI> Compli∣ment was pouring
Oil upon the Head. In all which Observances, <HI>Simon</HI> (tho' of the
formal Sect of the <HI>Pharisees</HI>) <PB N="163" REF="202"/> was defective.
Insomuch that our <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> taxes him of this neglected Office in his
Entertainment, <HI>Thou gavest me no Water for my Feet,</HI> &amp;c. And well
might the <HI>Pharisee</HI> read his own Fault in the Praise
<HI>Christ</HI> gave of this Woman, so well seen in the Customs of her
Coun∣try, in redoubling of her Kisses of an humble Thankfulness on
those Sacred Feet.</P>
<P>To Repent then is to Kiss the Feet of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and it is
all one to be sorry for our Sins, and to love <HI>him</HI>; this is confirm'd
by our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Words, who denomi∣nates this whole Action from
<HI>Love. Christ</HI> says not, she <HI>wept</HI> much, she
<HI>sor∣row'd</HI> much, but she <HI>lov'd</HI> much, and by all means
she sought to express her great Love, which great Mercy rais'd. For
nothing she had was too dear, with her most precious and fragrant Ointment
she anointed our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Feet, that rich and costly Testimony
of her Love she bestow'd freely, for she did not <HI>drop</HI> but
<HI>pour,</HI> not a <HI>Dram</HI> or <HI>two</HI> but a <HI>whole Pound,</HI>
not reserving any, but breaking the Box, and pouring it all out: What went
before was the Sacrifice of a broken Heart, with that first Sacrifice she
ador'd the Divinity of <HI>Christ,</HI> this last she tendreth to his
Humanity: The <PB N="164" REF="203"/> first Shower of her Tears were Tears of
<HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI>; the latter, which overtook the
first, were Tears of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Love.</HI> And so pleasing to
<HI>Christ</HI> were all the Actions of this perfect Pe∣nitent, that he not
only defended her against the <HI>Pharisee,</HI> in preferring her
Kindness to the Entertainment of his House; but against <HI>Satan</HI>
and the Powers of Hell, in forgiving her many Sins with∣out any Enumeration of
them. This is the Substance of what passed betwixt <HI>Jesus</HI> and
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> in the Pha∣risee's House; but I cannot leave this
happy Convert there, but must follow her to <HI>Bethany,</HI> to see her
Comport∣ment there, and at our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Death, and after that at his
Resurrection.</P>
<P><HI>Jesus</HI> having left <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in the 3d Year of
his Publick Ministry, after he had Wept over it, he came to <HI>Bethany,</HI>
where he met with another sort of Re∣ception than he had at the <HI>Holy
City</HI>; there he Supped; where <HI>Martha</HI> making great Preparations for
his Entertainment, to express her Joy and Affection to his Person,
desir'd <HI>Jesus</HI> to dismiss her Si∣ster <HI>Mary</HI> from his
Feet, who sate there Feasting her self with the Food of An∣gels, the
Words of God, unmindful of providing for his Entertainment; But 
<PB N="165" REF="204"/> <HI>Jesus</HI> commended her Choice, and tho' he did
not expresly refuse <HI>Martha</HI>'s Ci∣vility, yet he preferr'd
<HI>Mary</HI>'s Religion. Here <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> (who had spent before
one Box of <HI>Nard Pistick</HI> upon our <HI>Lord</HI>'s Feet as a Sacrifice
for her Conversion) now bestow'd another in Thankfulness in restoring
her Brother <HI>Lazarus</HI> to Life, and consign'd her <HI>Lord</HI> to his
Burial; and here too she met with an evil Interpreter, <HI>Judas</HI> an
<HI>Apostle,</HI> one of <HI>Christ</HI>'s own Family, pretended it had
been better to have given it to the Poor; but it was <HI>Malice</HI> and the
Spirit of Envy that spoke, not Religion. For he that sees an Action well
done, and seeks to undervalue it, by telling how it might have been done
better, reproves nothing but his own Spirit; For a Man may do very well, and
<HI>God</HI> will accept it, tho' to say he might have done bet∣ter, is to
say only, that Action was not the most absolute and perfect in it's Kind;
but the End of that Man best shew'd his present Meaning; and at the
best it could be no other than a rash Judgment of the Action and Intent of
<HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and by his declaiming against her he made tacite
Reflections upon his <HI>Lord</HI> for suffering it; and yet it is not
intima∣ted <PB N="166" REF="205"/> in the History of the Life of
<HI>Jesus,</HI> that <HI>Judas</HI> had any Malice against the Person of
<HI>Christ</HI>; for when afterwards he saw the Matter was to end in the
Death of the Lord, he repented; but a base unworthy Spirit of
Covetousness possess'd him, and the Relicks of Indig∣nation for
missing the Price of the Oint∣ment burnt in his Bowels, with a secret
dark melancholy Fire, and broke out into an Action which all Ages of the World
could never Parallel: <HI>To what end was this waste of Ointment,</HI> says
<HI>Judas, for it might have been sold for more than Three hundred Pence, and
been given to the Poor</HI>; but <HI>Jesus</HI> said, <HI>Let her alone,
why trouble you her, she hath wrought a good work on me.</HI></P>
<P>As this was well intended, it was well taken by <HI>Christ,</HI>
and approv'd of by all present except <HI>Judas,</HI> who liking his own Gain
better than any Scent in the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> Shop, seeing that spent
on his Master's Head, which he wish'd in his own Purse, grumbled at it;
and that with so colourable a Pretence, that it was a needless Expence, a
Waste, and that it might have been bestow'd much better for the Relief of
the <HI>Poor,</HI> as that <HI>Judas</HI> drew some of the
<HI>Disciples</HI> to favour the Motion, and to dislike 
<PB N="167" REF="206"/> <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> and her Action; so that both
they and he joyn'd in one Bill; but he of wretched Covetousness of Mind,
and they of a simple plain Intent and Purpose, thinking all that was
well∣spoken was well-meant; so that the Action was not brought only
against her that bestow'd it, but against <HI>Christ</HI> that admitted
it. Whereupon he pleads her Cause, not only excusing her, but com∣mending
it as a good Work And yet the Ointment was not so pleasing to his Sense
as her Gratitude was to his Spirit; for he then declar'd, that the Ointment
which fill'd the House with the Scent, should fill the whole World with the
Report of it; and as far as the Gospel should be preach'd, so far
should the Remembrance of her Action reach, as well for her Commendation, as
for our Imitation.</P>
<P>Thus we see Things well done are oftentimes ill taken, and often
good In∣tentions want good Constructions. No Person had such Experience
of this as <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>: The Scripture records three several
Virtues of hers, and in each of them she was murmur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at. When in the Bitterness of her Soul, she
shew'd her Repentance by Tears, <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Pha∣risee</HI> did
what he could to Disgrace her: <PB N="168" REF="207"/> When sitting at
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Feet, <HI>Martha</HI> her Sister complain'd of her to
<HI>Christ</HI>; and now here again the third Time, when in an honest
regard of her Duty, she's shewing her Thankfulness for Com∣fort receiv'd,
<HI>Christ</HI>'s own Disciple speaks against her. So that if she
washes <HI>Christ</HI>'s Feet with Tears it contents not, if she anoints
his Head with Balm its Matter of Displeasure, and if she Sits still and
says nothing, 'tis all one, still <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> is in Fault, her
Doings ever stand awry: This is the Fortune of all that follow her Steps;
even <HI>Christ</HI> himself could neither have his Feet a∣nointed, but
<HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Pharisee,</HI> nor his Head anointed, but
<HI>Judas</HI> his Apo∣stle, speaks against it.</P>
<P>But we must not leave <HI>Mary Mag∣dalen</HI> here; for
notwithstanding these great Discouragements and Rebukes, which she
receiv'd from <HI>Judas</HI> and some of the Disciples, she neglected not
her Duty, nor left her <HI>Lord</HI> till his Death; for loving
<HI>Christ</HI> more than her Life, she followed him in his Journey to his
Death, attending him when his Disci∣ples fled, being more willing to Die with
him, than to Live without him. She was last at his Cross, and first at
his Grave, staid longest there, and was <PB N="169" REF="208"/> soonest
here; she could not rest till she was up to seek him, sought him
before the Day lighted her; she stood by the Grave, where faint Love uses
not to <HI>stand</HI>; we bring our Friends to the Grave, and there leave
them, but come no more at it, nor stay longer by it; but <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI> did, and she only and none but she, as we shall see by
the Se∣quel of this Discourse.</P>
<P>We find in the whole Tenour of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> that God
observes a mixture of much spiritual Power and Glory, with much outward
Meanness: The Gospel is call'd a rich Treasure in an earthen Vessel;
the Mystery conveyed is preci∣ous, but the Means of Conveyance mean and
contemptible; The whole Mystery of <HI>Christ</HI> is made up of Power and
Meekness; his Conception was by the Holy Ghost, of a pure Virgin, but the
out-side Mean, his Blessed Mother, an Earthen Vessel, the Spouse of
a poor <HI>Carpenter</HI>; his Birth publish'd by an Angel, but discover'd
first to poor Shep∣herds; his Lodging pointed out by a Star, and yet his
Cradle but a Manger, his Nursery but a Stable: Being in the Wilderness he
was attended by Angels; but see the poor Out-side, he was a∣mongst wild
Beasts; in his Agony he <PB N="700" REF="209"/> was full of Trembling and
Horror, but then he receiv'd Comfort from Heaven by an Angel; at his Death he
was Cru∣cified with Thieves, but yet the Powers of <HI>Heaven</HI> and
<HI>Earth</HI> trembled at it: The Tidings of his Resurrection were told by
an Angel, but spread through the World by poor weak Women. Had Flesh and
Blood had the Management of the News of his Resurrection, it would have been
first publish'd to the College of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and St.
<HI>Peter</HI> should have had the first Intelligence by a Vision of
Angels directed to him. Kings and Princes make known their Minds to inferior
People by their <HI>Great Officers</HI> and <HI>Ministers,</HI> but the
<HI>Court of Heaven</HI> takes other Measures. <HI>God</HI> em∣ploys poor,
and in the Eye of the World, contemptible Men, to declare his Will to the
<HI>Potentates</HI> of the World: And this was the grand Objection made by the
mistaken <HI>Pagans</HI> to <HI>Christ</HI> and his Disciples, that
<HI>Christianity</HI> was set on foot by such abject and mean Persons
as <HI>Christ</HI> made choice of; but that which begat in them Contempt and
Scorn, ought to fill us with Wonder and Admiration.</P>
<P>And to make Amends for that Ob∣servation, that no good Angel ever
as∣sum'd the Likeness of a Woman, here <PB N="171" REF="210"/> are Women
(of whom <HI>M. Magdalen</HI> was chief) made Angels, <HI>i. e.</HI> (as the
original signifies) <HI>Messengers</HI> and <HI>Pub∣lishers</HI> of the
greatest Mystery of our Religion; for <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> with other
devout Women, (who not considering the Resurrection of <HI>Christ</HI>)
went with a pious Intention to do an Office of Re∣spect and Honour to the
Body of their Master, which they meant to embalm in the Tomb, where they
thought to have found it; there was <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>God</HI> of Life,
dead and laid in a Grave, and here was <HI>Man,</HI> a <HI>dead Man</HI>
risen out of the Grave; here are <HI>Angels</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> employed
in so low an Office as to in∣struct Women, and Women employ'd in so high
an Office as to instruct the <HI>Apostles</HI>; here are <HI>angelical</HI>
Women, and <HI>evangelical Angels</HI>; Angels made <HI>Evan∣gelists</HI> to
preach the Gospel, and <HI>Women</HI> made <HI>Angels</HI> to be
<HI>Instructors</HI> of the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' it has been doubted whe∣ther the <HI>blessed
Virgin</HI> was there when this pass'd at the Sepulcher, yet that <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of <HI>James</HI> and
<HI>Salmone</HI> were there is cer∣tain.</P>
<P>They came to embalm the Body of Jesus, (for the Rights of
embalming a∣mongst <PB N="172" REF="211"/> the <HI>Jews</HI> us'd to last
<HI>forty Days</HI>) and their Love was not satisfy'd with what
<HI>Joseph</HI> had done; but herein they were very inconsiderate, for that
was only done upon such Bodies as were ex∣tenerated and embowell'd, and then
fill'd up and plaister'd about with Spices and Gumms to preserve them from
Pu∣trefaction, when they were to be carried into remote Parts; but of these
re-em∣balmings, after the Body had been laid in the Sepulcher, I never read,
neither seems it to have been possible for these Women to have come at
the Body of <HI>Christ:</HI> And by the Winding-sheet of <HI>Christ,</HI>
which is kept in <HI>Savoy,</HI> it appears that that Sheet stuck so
close to the Body, as that it did, and does still retain the Demensions
of his Body, and the Im∣pressions and Marks of every Wound that he receiv'd
in his Body; so that it would have been no easie Matter for these Women
to have pull'd off that Sheet, if it had been fasten'd to his Bo∣dy with
nothing but his Blood: But if (as some Authors say) his Body was car∣ried
loose in the Sheet which is shew'd in <HI>Savoy,</HI> from the Cross to
the Sepul∣cher, and then taken out of that Sheet and embalmed by
<HI>Nicodemus,</HI> and wrapp'd up in other Linnen upon those 
<PB N="173" REF="212"/> <HI>Spices</HI> and <HI>Gums</HI> which he bestow'd
up∣on it, and then buried according to the Manner of the <HI>Jews,</HI> whose
Custom it was to swath the Bodies of the Dead, as we do Children, all over,
(for so <HI>La∣zarus</HI> came out bound Hand and Foot with Grave-cloaths)
how could these Women think to embalm the Body of <HI>Jesus</HI> so
swath'd and bound up as that Body was? for certainly it was the Bo∣dy not the
Grave-cloaths they meant to embalm, and it seems strange that no one has
touch'd upon this Doubt: All Expositors make good Use of their Piety and
devout Care of their dead Master, but of the Impossibility of their
coming to the Body, of the Irregularity of their Undertaking that, and
proceeding so far in that which could not possibly be done, there is no
mention: Indeed <HI>Cry∣sologus</HI> says, <HI>saeva passionis
procella tur∣baverat, that a bitter Storm of Passion and Consternation
had so disorder'd them, as that no Faculty of theirs could per∣form their
right Function: &amp; praefervose caecutiebant,</HI> Earnestness had so
discom∣pos'd and amaz'd them, as they discern'd nothing clearly, nor did
nothing order∣ly. Another inconsiderate Action of these Women was, the
removing the Stone of the <HI>Sepulcher,</HI> for they had pre∣par'd 
<PB N="174" REF="213"/> their Gumms, and were on the way to the
<HI>Sepulcher</HI> before they thought of that; then they stop, and say one
to another, <HI>who shall roll away the Stone from the</HI> Sepulcher. Yet
they still go on, and their Love answers the Objection, not knowing how it
should be done; but yet resolving to go through all Difficulties, but never
think how they should pass the Guard that was set at the Tomb. But when
they came there, they found the Guard affrighted and re∣mov'd, and the Stone
roll'd away; for a little before they arriv'd there had been a great
<HI>Earthquake,</HI> and an <HI>Angel</HI> descending from <HI>Heaven</HI>
had roll'd a∣way the Stone and sate upon it; with the Terror of his
Appearance and the Earthquake, the Soldiers were asto∣nish'd, and were like
dead Men; and some of them ran to the <HI>High-Priest</HI> and told what
had happen'd: Hereup∣on the Women finding the Door o∣pen, enter'd into the
<HI>Sepulcher,</HI> and missing the Body of <HI>Jesus, M. Magda∣len</HI>
ran to the <HI>Eleven Apostles,</HI> com∣plaining that the Body of our
<HI>Lord</HI> was not to be found; they thought this Story the Product of a
weak and frightned Fancy; however <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> ran as
fast as they could to see; for the Un∣expectedness <PB N="175" REF="214"/>
of the Relation, the Won∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>f the
Story, and the Sadness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n,
mov'd them. They presently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed to
the Garden, but <HI>John</HI> being

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y this time <HI>M.
Magdalen</HI> was come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again to
the <HI>Sepulcher</HI> where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>r

the <HI>Angel</HI> speaks to them, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s them of another gross
Absurdity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ebukes them for it,
<HI>Why seek ye the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>g amongst
the dead?</HI> Why him who <PB N="176" REF="215"/> is the Son of the living God,
the Prince of Life, who hath Life in himself, and who is Life it self,
amongst the Tombs of dead Mortals? What makes you think of arming him with
Gumms against Pu∣trefaction, who told you before he was not subject to
Corruption but would rise again? <HI>M. Magdalen</HI> also fell into such
another Error: For when the <HI>Angel</HI> had told her at the Sepulcher,
<HI>He is not here, for He is risen, as he said</HI>; yet when she came
running to <HI>Peter,</HI> she said no∣thing of the
<HI>Resurrection,</HI> never thought of that, but pour'd her self out in
that Lamentation, <HI>they have taken away our Lord.</HI> Whereas if she had
consider'd, she must necessarily have known from the Angel's Words,
that no Man had taken away the <HI>Lord,</HI> that no Man had laid him any
where else, but that by his own Power he was risen: But as in this Storm of
Passion, they left <HI>Christ</HI>'s Promise, that he would rise,
unconsider'd, never remember'd the rolling of the Stone from the Door of the
Sepulcher, nei∣ther did they consider the Impossibility of coming to
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Body to do the Office they intended: Their Devotion was
awake, but their Consideration was not so; however they did not lose all
the Benefits of their pious and devout <PB N="177" REF="216"/> Intention; for
the <HI>Angel</HI> did not forbear to comfort them with, <HI>Do not ye
fear:</HI> Let them continue in Fear that remain in Unbelief, and have no God
to com∣fort themselves in. Let those mercena∣ry Soldiers that are hir'd to
watch the Sepulcher fear, and never recover; but why should <HI>You</HI> fear
who see none but us, your Fellow-Citizens in the Service of God, if your
Conversation be in Hea∣ven as it is, if you do truly seek that
<HI>Jesus</HI> who is risen that he might go thi∣ther.</P>
<P>It seems the other Women, who came with <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> and
stay'd till <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> had been there to make Trial of
<HI>M. Magdalen</HI>'s Report, as they were speedy in coming, and diligent in
search∣ing <HI>Christ,</HI> so they were in haste to be gone when they
could not find him, and fearful of farther seeking, and their Departure
commends <HI>M. Magdalen</HI>'s staying behind: To the Grave she came
before them, from the Grave she went to tell them, thither she returns with
them, and there she stays behind them; a stronger Affection fix'd her,
and so fix'd her, that she had not Power to re∣move thence.</P>
<P>To stay whilst Company stays that is the <HI>World</HI>'s
Love, but <HI>Peter</HI> is gone, <PB N="178" REF="217"/> and <HI>John</HI> is
gone, and the <HI>Women</HI> are gone, and she left alone, and to stay
a∣lone shews constant Love. She stood and wept, she wish'd to find
<HI>Christ,</HI> and therefore wept for his Absence, whom she dearly
lov'd whilst she had him, she bitterly bewail'd him she thought lost;
and having lost the Sight of her Life, she desir'd to dwell in the dark,
chusing <HI>Christ</HI>'s Tomb for her best home, and there stood
weeping; she abandon'd the Living for the Company of the Dead; and now it
seems that even the dead have forsaken her, since the Body she seeks
is taken away from her: It was Love in∣duc'd her to stand, and Sorrow forc'd
her to weep; her Eye was watchful to seek, whom her Heart most lov'd to
en∣joy; and her Feet in a Readiness to run, if her Eye could chance to
espye him. But as she watch'd to find her lost Lord, she wept for
having lost whom she had lov'd, for as first she mourn'd for the
Departure of his Soul out of his Body, so now she lamented the taking his
Body out of the Grave; for tho' her first Sorrow was because she could
not enjoy him <HI>alive,</HI> yet she hop'd at least to have found him
<HI>dead</HI>; to which purpose she had prepar'd her <HI>Spices,</HI> and
provided her <HI>Oyntments,</HI> to <PB N="179" REF="218"/> pay him the last
Duties: And tho' <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Nicodemus</HI> had already
bestow'd a hundred Pound of Myrrhe and Aloes, which was as well apply'd as
Art and Devotion could desire, yet such was her Love, that she would have
thought a∣ny Quantity too little without the Ad∣dition of her own; she came
therefore now intending to embalm his Corps, as she had before anointed his
Feet; and as in the Spring of her Felicity she had washed his Feet with her
Tears, bewailing unto him the Death of her own Soul, so now she came in the
Depth of her Misery to shed them again for the Death of his Body. But when
she saw the Grave open'd, and the Body gone, the Labour of embalming was
prevented: But the Cause of her Tears increas'd, and tho' she found no
Use for the Spices, yet she found how to employ her Tears, now as much
afflicted for his Loss, as be∣fore she had been pleas'd at his Presence.
But since weeping without searching was to no Purpose, her weeping
hin∣der'd not her Inquiry, her Sorrow dull'd not her Diligence; she often
stoop'd and look'd into the Grave, but why should she now look in,
since <HI>Peter</HI> had been in the Tomb, and <HI>John</HI> had look'd in
before. However she will not trust <PB N="180" REF="219"/> either
<HI>Peter</HI>'s or <HI>John</HI>'s Eyes, nay she will not trust her
self, she will suspect her own Senses, she will rather think she
look'd not well before, than leave off looking. And thus hoping in Despair,
and despairing in Hope, she stood at the <HI>Sepulcher</HI> without fear,
because she thought now nothing left that ought to be fear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. But with what Hope or with what Heart
could she stand alone at the Tomb, when the Disciples were gone; for her
Eyes had seen, and <HI>Peter</HI>'s Hands had felt, that the <HI>Lord</HI>
was not there; the empty Winding-sheet did also confirm it, and yet nothing
could make her be∣lieve it; her disappointed Love had drown'd both her Mind
and Memory so deep in Sorrow, and so amaz'd her Senses by his Absence,
that all remem∣brance of his former Promises was di∣verted with the Crowd of
present Trou∣bles; for doubtless, had she remember'd him, as she
should have done, she would not have thought the Tomb a fit Place to seek
him in, neither would she have mourn'd for him as dead, and remov'd by the
Treachery of others, but joy'd in him, as reviv'd by his own Power; but Sorrow
had quite stupify'd her Senses, distemper'd her Thoughts, discourag'd
her Hopes, awak'd her Passions, and left <PB N="181" REF="220"/> her no
other liberty than to weep, she wept therefore; and as she was weep∣ing,
she stoop'd down, and look'd into the <HI>Sepulcher,</HI> and saw two
Angels in White, one at the Head, and the other at the Feet, where the Body of
<HI>Jesus</HI> had been laid: Angels in a Grave! a strange Sight! never
seen before: That sure was a Place fitter for Worms than Angels. They were
in White too, a Co∣lour expressive of Joy, <HI>Heaven</HI> mourn'd at his
<HI>Passion,</HI> the Eclipse of that Day shew'd them all in Black, but
at the <HI>Re∣surrection</HI> they rejoyce, they are now all in White, even
the Heavens and Angels. They were sitting, the one at the Head, the other at
the Feet, which may be re∣ferr'd to <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s having anoin∣ted
his Head and his Feet, they sat at these two Places, as it were to
acknow∣ledge so much for her Sake: Between the <HI>Angels</HI> there was no
striving for Places; he that sat at the <HI>Feet</HI> was as well
con∣tented, as he that sat at the <HI>Head</HI>; but with us, both Angels
would have been at the Head, never a one at the Feet: <HI>And they said unto
her, Woman, why weepest thou?</HI> They ask'd her, Why she wept? believing
she had no Cause, all was in Error, Tears of Grief, but false Grief,
imagining him to be dead that was <PB N="182" REF="221"/> alive; she wept
because she found the Grave empty, which, God forbid, she should have
found full, for then <HI>Christ</HI> must have been dead still; for want
of Belief in his Resurrection, she believ'd he was carried away; she
err'd in so be∣lieving; there was Error in her <HI>Love,</HI> but there was
Love in her Error; and it was a great Argument of her Love, to call him
<HI>Lord,</HI> after he had suffer'd the most opprobrious and ignominious
Death, such as would have made many blush to own him.</P>
<P>When she look'd first she saw no An∣gel, and then of a
sudden looking down, she saw two; yet the suddenness and
gloriousness of the Sight mov'd her not at all, she seem'd to have no
Sense of it, but wept on, which was strange; for here methinks her good
Fortune exceeds her Hopes, and where her last Sorrow was bred, her first
Succour arises, for she sought but one, and she found two; one dead
Body was the Cause of her Errand, and she found two alive; her Weeping was
for a Man, and her Tears have found Angels, who invite her to a Parly, and
seem to pity her Case. They sit at the Tomb, to shew they are no
Strangers to her Loss, they spake to her, as tho' they had some special
Message to <PB N="183" REF="222"/> deliver to her; and if she had ask'd
them concerning her Master, they were the likeliest to give her a
satisfactory An∣swer, and to have told her the Cause of their coming, and
the Reason of her <HI>Lord</HI>'s remove; but nothing could move her to admit
Comfort, or to entertain any Company, for having vow'd her self to
<HI>Christ</HI> alone, except to him, she will neither lend her Ear, nor
borrow others Help: Besides, whatever they could tell her, if they told her
not of him, and whatsoever they told her of him, if they told her not where
he was, both their telling, and her hearing, were but a wasting of Time; for
she came not thither to see Angels, but him who made both her and them, and
to whom she ow'd more than to Men and Angels; and being full of wavering
Uncertain∣ties, and perplex'd Thoughts, she be∣gan to think, if she staid
there by the Tomb where he was not, she should never find him; and if she
would go farther to seek, she knew not whither; to part with the Tomb was
Death to her, and to stand helpless by it would do no good; so that all
her Comfort was, that she must either stay there with∣out Help, or go
without Hope: Then she blam'd her self, for leaving him when 
<PB N="184" REF="223"/> she had him, thus to lament him now she had lost
him, and for departing when it was time to stay, and returning when it was
too late to Help; forget∣ting what her Master used to say, when he told
her, <HI>He would rise again the third Day:</HI> But why doth she torment
her self with these tragical Surmises? Does she think the
<HI>Angels</HI> would sit still if their <HI>God</HI> were not well, did
they serve him after his Fasting, and would they despise him after his
Decease? If in the Garden he might have had Twelve Legions of An∣gels, (as he
said) Is his Power so gone with the Life of his Body, that he could not now
Command them? Was there an Angel found to help <HI>Daniel</HI> to his Dinner,
to save <HI>Toby</HI> from the Fish, and to defend <HI>Balaam</HI>'s poor
Beast from his Master's Rage? And is the <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>An∣gels</HI>
of so little Concern, that if his Body wanted it, no Angel would defend it?
But she saw two there to Honour his <HI>Tomb</HI>; and how much more
careful would they be to do Homage to his Person? She might well think they
would not Smile, if she had just Occa∣sion to Weep, they would not so
glori∣ously sit in white, if a black and mourn∣ing Weed did better become
them.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="224"/>But why did her Sorrow question so much
about the Place where they had laid her <HI>Lord?</HI> might not she better
sup∣pose, that he was in <HI>Paradise</HI>; for since he came to repair
<HI>Adam</HI>'s Ruins, and to be the <HI>common Parent</HI> of our Redem∣ption,
as <HI>Adam</HI> was of our Original In∣fection, 'twas reasonable, that
having en∣dur'd all his Life the Penalty of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Exile, he should
after Death re-enter upon a Possession of that Inheritance which
<HI>Adam</HI> lost. And besides, if her Sorrow at the Cross had not made
her as Deaf, as at the Tomb it made her Forgetful, she could not but have
re∣member'd what he himself said to one of the <HI>Thieves, That the same
Day he should be with him in</HI> Paradise.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> thus lost her self in a
Labyrinth of Doubts, mixing Tears with her Words, and warming them with Sighs,
she saw the Angels with a kind of Reverence as tho' they had done Honour to
one behind her; whereupon she turn'd back and saw <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
standing, but knew not that it was <HI>him.</HI> For when <HI>Jesus</HI>
saw that nothing would give her Comfort but himself, that no
<HI>Angels,</HI> no Sight, no Speech of others would serve, then her
<HI>Lord</HI> comes, and from seeking him dead, she <PB N="186" REF="225"/>
finds him alive; but first he comes un∣known, stands by her, and she did
not suspect that it was he; she not only knew not that 'twas
<HI>Jesus,</HI> but mistook him for the <HI>Gardiner:</HI> Proper enough it
was, and fitted well with the Time and Place, it was the Spring, and in a
Garden, and she did not mistake in taking him for a <HI>Gardiner,</HI> tho'
she might seem to err in some Sense; yet in another Sense she was
in the right: For in a Spiritual Sense, <HI>Christ</HI> may be said to be
a Gar∣diner, for of the first the fairest Garden that ever was,
<HI>Paradise,</HI> he was the Gar∣diner, it was of his Planting, and ever
since it is he that makes all our <HI>Gardens</HI> Green, sends us Yearly
the Spring, and all the <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> we gather in the
Season: And 'tis he that gardens our Souls too, and weeds out of them
whatsoever is prejudicial to or destru∣ctive of his Word sown in our
Hearts. He sows them with the true Roots of all <HI>Christian Virtues,</HI>
waters them with the Dew of his Grace, and makes them bring forth Fruit to
<HI>Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>Besides all this, Christ on the Day of his Resurrection was
most properly a Gar∣diner, and that a strange One, who made such an Herb
grow out of the Ground that Day, as the like was never seen be∣fore, 
<PB N="187" REF="226"/> (except in the Instance of <HI>Laza∣rus</HI> rais'd by
him) a dead Body to shoot forth alive from the Grave.</P>
<P>But was it possible that <HI>Mary Magda∣len</HI> could forget
<HI>Jesus,</HI> whose Faith had fix'd him in her Understanding, her Love
in her Will, both Fear and Hope in her Memory, for him her Eye weeps, her
Thoughts greive, her whole <HI>Body</HI> fainteth, her Soul languisheth, and
there was no Part of her that was not busie about him; and yet she had
forgotten him; his Countenance and Voice assure her, his Words witness
it, her Eyes be∣hold him, and yet she knew him not: But there was such a
Shower of Tears between her and him, and her Eyes were so dimm'd with weeping
for him, that tho' she saw the Man, she could not discern
<HI>Jesus</HI>; and therefore as he seems to her a Stranger, he asketh the
same Question of her which the Angels had, only quickens it a little with
<HI>Woman why weepest thou, whom seekest thou?</HI> If she seeks
<HI>Christ,</HI> why knows she him not? and if she knows him, why does
she seek him whom she sees? It is a common thing with us to seek a
Thing, and when we have found it, not to know we have.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="227"/>Scarce three Days ago she saw him hanging
on a Tree with his Head crown'd with Thorns, his Eyes full of Sorrow, his Ears
fill'd with Blasphemies, his Mouth fed with Gall, his whole Person mangled
and disfigur'd, his Arms and Legs rack'd with violent Pulls, his Hands and Feet
boar'd with Nails, his Side wounded with a Spear, his whole Body torn with
Scourges and goar'd with Blood; and yet Christ asketh her, <HI>Why she
weeps?</HI> and not without Cause doth he ask this Question, because
she would have <HI>Christ</HI> alive, and yet wept because she did not
find him dead: She was sorry he was not there, and for that very Cause
she should rather have been glad; for if he were Dead she might have
expected to see him there, but his not being there was a sign he was Alive:
But she still taking <HI>Jesus</HI> to be the Gardiner, said unto him,
<HI>If thou hast carried him from hence, tell me where thou hast laid him,
and I will take him away:</HI> To ask <HI>Christ</HI> for <HI>Christ</HI>
seems somewhat strange, which however it falls out in other Matters, here
it was safe, even when we seek <HI>Christ,</HI> to pray <HI>Christ</HI>
to help us to find <HI>Christ,</HI> for we cannot come to him ex∣cept he
draws us: But <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> seems something more harsh to
<HI>Christ</HI> <PB N="189" REF="228"/> than to the Angels, to them she
com∣plains of <HI>others,</HI> saying, <HI>they</HI> have taken him away: But
she seems to charge <HI>Christ,</HI> at least to suspect him of the
Fact, as if he had look'd like one that had been a Robber of Graves; her
<HI>if</HI> im∣plies as much, but Love, as it fears where it need not, so it
suspects without Cause. But St. <HI>Bernard</HI> speaks to
<HI>Christ</HI> for her: <HI>Domine amor quem habebat in Te, &amp; dolor quem
habebat de Te, excusat eam apud Te, si fortè erravit circa Te.</HI>
The Love she bore him, the Sorrow she had for him, may excuse her, if
she were in any Error concerning him, in her say∣ing, <HI>Si
sustulisti.</HI> Her Affections seem to transport her, (as she
says) no Man knows what, to one a meer Stranger to her, and she to him,
she talks to one thrice under the Name of him, if thou hast taken him, tell
me where thou hast laid him, and I will fetch him; alas poor Woman, she was
not able to lift him, there goes more than one or two either to the carrying of
a Corps; as for his, it had more than a Hundred Pound weight of Myrrh and other
Odours up∣on it.</P>
<P>She charged not the Angels with his Removal, nor seem'd to
mistrust them, for she did not request them to inform 
<PB N="190" REF="229"/> her where he was laid; but now she judgeth the
Gardiner to be the Author of her Loss, being almost fully persua∣ded,
that he was privy to the Place, and acquainted with the Action; and tho' she
was not altogether in the right, yet she was not much in the wrong, and err'd
with such aim, that she miss'd very little of the Truth.</P>
<P>But since she was so desirous to know where <HI>Jesus</HI>
lay, Why did not she name him when she ask'd for him? She says only she
will take <HI>Him</HI> away, her Cou∣rage seems above the Strength of a
Wo∣man, neither does she remember that all Women are weak, she promiseth
without Condition, she makes no Ex∣ception, as if nothing were impossible
that her Love suggesteth. It was indeed wonderful, that <HI>Love</HI> had
so bereav'd her of Sense, that tho' she saw the An∣gels, she could
not see <HI>Jesus.</HI> She sought for one, whom when she had found
she knew not; and not knowing him when she found him, she sought for
him when she had him: But alas, how could poor <HI>Mary</HI> believe, that
after her <HI>Lord</HI> had liv'd so long, labour'd so much, died with
such Pain, and shed such showers of Blood, he should come to no
higher a Preferment, than to be a <HI>Gardiner</HI>; <PB N="191" REF="230"/> Was
a sorry Garden the best Inheri∣tance her Love could have imagin'd for him,
or a <HI>Gardiner</HI>'s Office the highest Dignity she could allow him? It
had been better he had liv'd to have been <HI>Lord</HI> of her Castle of
<HI>Magdalen,</HI> than with his Death so dearly to have purchas'd so mean
a Post.</P>
<P>But her Mistake hath in it a farther Mystery, tho' her Sight was
deceiv'd, she thought not amiss; For as our first Father in his State of
Innocence was plac'd in a Garden of Pleasure, and his first Office was that
of a <HI>Gardiner</HI>; so the first Man that ever was in <HI>Glory,</HI>
appear'd first in a Garden, and presented himself in the likeness of a
<HI>Gardiner,</HI> that the beginning of Glory might re∣semble that of
Innocence and Grace. And as that <HI>Gardiner</HI> was the foil of Mankind, the
Parent of Sin, and Au∣thor of Death; so this was the Raiser of our Ruins,
the Ransom of our Offence, and the Restorer of Life. In a <HI>Garden,</HI>
Man was deceiv'd and ensnar'd by the Devil. In a Garden, <HI>Christ</HI>
was betray'd and apprehended by the <HI>Jews.</HI> In a Garden, <HI>Adam</HI>
was condemn'd to eat his Bread in the Sweat of his Brows; And after a Free-Gift
of the Bread of Angels in the last Supper, <HI>Christ</HI> did 
<PB N="192" REF="231"/> earn it us, with a <HI>Bloody Sweat</HI> of his whole
Body; And as by Disobedient eating the Fruit of a <HI>Tree,</HI> our Right to
the Garden of Paradise was forfeited by <HI>Adam</HI>; so by the Obedient
Death of <HI>Christ upon a Tree,</HI> a far better Right is now settled;
And as when <HI>Adam</HI> sinn'd in the Garden of Paradise, he was then
apparell'd in the Skin of a dead Beast, that his Cloathing might betoken his
Grave, and his Livery of Death agree with his Condemnation to Die; so to
defray the Debt of that Sin, in this Garden <HI>Christ</HI> lay clad in the
dead Man's Shrowd, and buried in his Tomb, that as our Evils began so they
might end, and such Places and Means as were the Premises of our Misery,
might be also the end of our Misfortune; and for these Reasons <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI> was allow'd to mistake, that we might be inform'd of the
Mystery, and see how aptly the Course of our Redemption did answer the
Process of our Condemnation.</P>
<P>But why could not <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> as well see what in truth
Christ was, as what in show he seem'd to be? but she thought so to
have found him as she left him, and she sought him as she saw him
last, being so overcome with Sorrow for his Death, that she had neither
room <PB N="193" REF="232"/> nor respite in her Mind, for any hope of his
Life, and therefore she ask'd the <HI>Gardiner, If thou hast carried him
hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him.</HI></P>
<P>But one would be ready to think her Master was very unkind to
leave her so long without Comfort, and to punish her so much, who so
well deserv'd Pardon: She did not follow the Tide of his bet∣ter Fortune, to
shift sail with the Stream; she left him not in his lowest Ebb, she
revolted not from his last Extremity; in his Life she serv'd him with her
Goods, in his Death she departed not from his Cross; and after Death she
came to dwell with him in his Grave.</P>
<P>But now <HI>Christ</HI> begins to take Pity on her, her Tears were
too mighty Orators to let her Suit fall, tho' they pleaded at the most
rigorous Bar, they tie the Tongues of all Accusers, and soften the rigour
of the severest Judge, they win the Invincible, and bind the Omnipo∣tent;
when they seem most Pittiful, they have the greatest Power, and being
most Forsaken, they are more Victorious: For this Water her Heart had been
long a Limbeck, sometimes distilling it from the Weeds of her own Offences,
with the true Fire of Contrition, sometimes <PB N="194" REF="233"/> of the
Flowers of Spiritual Comforts, with the Flames of Contemplation; and at other
times out of the bitter Herbs of her Master's Miseries, with the Heat of a
tender Compassion. Her Tears, that were heretofore the <HI>Proctors</HI>
for her Brother's Life, were now the Invi∣ters of those Angels in the
Monument for her Comfort, and the Suiters that shall be rewarded with the
first Sight of her reviv'd Saviour. For when Christ saw all was in vain,
that neither Men nor Agels, nor himself (so long as he kept himself a
<HI>Gardiner</HI>) could get any Thing out of her, but that her Lord was gone,
he was taken away, and that nothing but <HI>Jesus</HI> could yield her any
Comfort; He is no longer able to contain, but even discloses himself, and
that by his Voice; And now <HI>Christ</HI> is found alive, that was sought
Dead. A Cloud may be so thick as to hide the Sun from our Sight, the Sun
must scatter that Cloud and then we may see its Light: Here is an Example
of it: A thick Cloud of Heaviness had so obscured <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI>'s Eyes, that she could not see him thro' it, this one word,
these two Syllables <HI>Ma-ry</HI> from his Mouth dispels all the
Darkness; no sooner had his Voice sounded in her Ears, but it drove away
all the Mist, dries up <PB N="195" REF="234"/> her Tears, opens her Eyes, and
she knows him, and answer'd him with her wonted Salutation,
<HI>Rabboni:</HI> Thus the <HI>Gardiner</HI> did his Part, brought <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI> from a dead and drooping, to a lively and cheerful Estate; She
sought <HI>Christ</HI> dead and imprison'd in a Stony-Grave, and finds
him both alive, and at full li∣berty; She sought him in a Shroud more like a
Leper than himself, left as the Model of the utmost Misery, and the only
Pattern of the bitterest Unhappi∣ness, and now she finds him invested
with Robes of Glory, the Owner and Giver of all Felicity. She that had so
long sought without finding, wept with∣out Comfort, and call'd without
Answer, is now fully satisfied with this one word, <HI>Mary,</HI> having
heard him call her in his wonted Manner, and usual Voice, this one word
restor'd her Senses, enlighten'd her Mind, quicken'd her Heart, and
re∣viv'd her Soul.</P>
<P>But why did <HI>Christ</HI> chuse to be made known to her by the
Ear, rather than by the Eye, by Hearing rather than by Appearing, because her
Eyes were hol∣den, till her Ears were open'd? The Philosophers tell us,
<HI>Hearing</HI> is the Sense of Wisdom, and in Matters of Faith the
<HI>Ear</HI> goes first, and is of more use, and <PB N="196" REF="235"/> to
be trusted before the <HI>Eye.</HI> No sooner had <HI>Christ</HI>'s Voice
sounded in her Ears, but she knew forthwith it was he; and being ravish'd
with his Voice, and im∣patient of Delays, a sudden Joy so over∣prest her,
by so unexpected a Presence, and so many Miracles laid at once before
her, that she could no more proceed in her own, than give <HI>Christ</HI>
leave to go forward with his Speech; but falling at his sacred Feet, she
offer'd to bath them with Tears of Joy, and to kiss his late
<HI>grievous,</HI> but now <HI>most glorious</HI> Wounds. But Christ forbad
her, saying, <HI>Touch me not:</HI> This seem'd a strange Rebuke to
<HI>Mary,</HI> who when dead in Sin, she touch'd his mortal Feet, and now
being alive in Grace, she was denied to touch his glo∣rious Feet, being
commanded from that for which she was before commended by our
<HI>Saviour.</HI> Alas! What Harm had there been if he had suffer'd her to
touch him? Before his Passion, many desir'd and strove to touch him,
and there went Virtue out of him, even while he was <HI>Mortal,</HI> but now he
was <HI>Immortal</HI> in all likelihood much more Virtue would pro∣ceed;
Christ was not used to be so ten∣der of being touch'd; at several Times
and Places he suffer'd the rude Multitude to crowd and thrust him, and much
ruder <PB N="197" REF="236"/> Touches at his Passion: Why suffer'd he them
<HI>then,</HI> and why suffer'd he not her <HI>now?</HI> she had touch'd
before both his Head and his Feet, and anointed them both, and she now
brought Odours in her Hand to Re-embalm him; It was early, and yet by that time
she had given very good Proofs of her Love: She was early up, came first to
the Grave, return'd and call'd <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> staid last
at the Grave, had been at such Cost, taken such Pains, had wept so much
as to refuse Comfort, even when offer'd by Angels, till she had found
<HI>Christ</HI> she was a Stranger to Consola∣tion, and now having found
him, that she must not touch him, seems very hard; one poor Touch had
been but an easie Recompence for all her Pains and Sorrow; But if we look
into the Rea∣son <HI>Christ</HI> gives, it is yet more strange, <HI>Touch
me not, for I am not yet ascen∣ded,</HI> as if he had said, when he was
Ascended then she should; but if stand∣ing upon Earth by him, he is not
to be touch'd, when he is taken up in∣to Heaven no Arm can reach him there.</P>
<P>There is a Time and Place for <HI>No∣li me tangere.</HI> The World
began with a <HI>Noli me tangere.</HI> The first Words <PB N="198" REF="237"/>
God spake then were, <HI>Touch not the forbidden Fruit</HI>: But Christ is
not the forbidden Tree but the Tree of Life, to be touch'd and tasted, that
we may live by him; but this <HI>touch me not</HI> was not on
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Part, but on <HI>Mary</HI>'s, no Lett in him to be touch'd,
the Lett was in her, she might not touch him; would <HI>Christ</HI> have
Men to touch him, and not Wo∣men; for St. <HI>Thomas</HI> put his whole Hand
into the Place of his Wounds, and put him to no Pain at all; and certain
<HI>Wo∣men</HI> met him in the way after his Resur∣rection, amongst which
was <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> and he then suffer'd them to touch him, and take
him by the Feet: So that it seems this Prohibition was not Real but
Personal, not absolutely but not at that time; which shews all was not
well with <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> something was amiss, she must have been
to blame in the Manner of her Offer; she must have been a little too
forward it may be, and not have us'd all the Respect she should have
done: For as soon as <HI>Christ</HI> cry'd <HI>Mary,</HI> she answer'd,
with her wonted Term, <HI>Rabboni</HI>; and as she saluted him with her
usual Word, so after her Custom she went towards him, and would have
touch'd him, not in such a Manner as was fitting to be ob∣serv'd, nor with
that Regard which his <PB N="199" REF="238"/> new glorified Estate seem'd
justly to re∣quire, for that which was enough to <HI>Christ</HI> a few Days
past, was not so now: She poor Woman was defective in her Judgment out of
an Excess of her Affe∣ction, she thought he had been <HI>Rabboni</HI>
still: It seem'd to her that <HI>Christ</HI> was now as her Brother
<HI>Lazarus</HI> was after his Re∣surrection; that <HI>Christ</HI> had
risen neither more nor less but just the same he was be∣before, to be
saluted, approach'd, and touched as formerly he had been.</P>
<P>It seems she was not before so carry'd away with Sorrow, but
she was now as far gone in the other of Joy, and so for∣got her self in
offering to touch him no otherwise than she did before: Her Case was like
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s in the Mount, who knew not what he said, when he
pro∣pos'd the building of three Tabernacles; she knew not what she did,
being so sur∣pris'd with the sudden Joy, as she had no Leisure to
recollect her self, to weigh the wonderful great Change this Day wrought in
him: For when her Judgment was better settled, she did touch him but then
it was upon her Knees, down at his Feet, another manner of Gesture than as it
seems she first offer'd.</P>
<P>'Tis true he gave St. <HI>Thomas</HI> leave to touch, whose Faith
was in his Fingers <PB N="200" REF="239"/> Ends; he then believ'd not, was in
Doubt, thought he had been a Ghost, and to clear that Doubt he was suffer'd
to touch him; St <HI>Thomas,</HI> and <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> or whoe∣ver touch'd
<HI>Christ</HI> on Earth, if they had not been more happy to touch him with
their <HI>Faith,</HI> than with their <HI>Hands,</HI> they had receiv'd no Good
at all by it; it was much better with Faith to touch the Hemm of his Garment,
than without it to touch any Part of his Body; touching was the proper Cure for
St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Di∣sease; but so it was not for <HI>M.
Magda∣len,</HI> who was sure the Voice she heard was that of
<HI>Rabboni,</HI> she had no need to be confirm'd in that. Her Disease
was of another Sort, not want of Faith, but want of due Regard; <HI>Thomas</HI>
touch'd be∣cause he believ'd not, she touch'd not because she
misbeliev'd; he touch'd that he might know Christ was risen; she touch'd
not that she might know, he was not so risen as she imagin'd, that is
as in former times she knew him. And <HI>Christ</HI> did hereby silently
tell her, there was a great Difference between a glorious and a mortal Body,
between the Condition of momentary and eternal Life, and that she should
rather with Reverence fall down afar off, than with such Familiarity
ap∣proach to touch him; that she was first <PB N="201" REF="240"/> to
embrace him with a firm Faith, then she should touch him with more worthy
<HI>Hands</HI>; and therefore he commanded her to go about that which requir'd
more haste, to run to his Brethren and inform them, that he would go before
them in∣to <HI>Galilee,</HI> and there they should see him; and so <HI>M.
Magdalen,</HI> preferring her <HI>Lord</HI>'s Will to her own, obey'd his
Command in departing, but thought her self but an unfortunate Messenger
of most joyful News, being banish'd from her Master's Presence, to
carry News of his Resur∣rection; and going in this perplex'd Manner, she
meets by the way the other holy Women, (who first came with her to the Grave)
whom the Angels had then assur'd of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Resurrection, and
as they all pass'd towards the Disciples, <HI>Jesus</HI> met them,
saying, <HI>All Hayle, and so they came near, and took hold of his
Feet,</HI> and ador'd him; then he said unto them, <HI>Fear not, go tell my
Brethren that I go into Galilee, there they shall see me.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Christ apply'd a Lenitive to as∣swage <HI>M.
Magdalen</HI>'s Pain, after the sharp Corrosive which had griev'd her
tender Wound, which was made rather by Ig∣norance than Error, and was as soon
cur'd as known, and therefore she was now admitted to kiss his Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="241"/>She had indeed great Favours granted her, not
only to see Angels, but to see <HI>Christ,</HI> and him first of all;
and more than that, to be employ'd by <HI>Christ</HI> upon a heavenly Errand,
and no Reason for this but that she lov'd much. We cannot say she
believ'd much, since she believ'd no more than just as much as the
<HI>High Priest</HI> would have the World believe, that he was taken away by
Night: Her Faith cannot be commended, but her Love cannot but be prais'd, of
which she gave good Proofs to <HI>Christ</HI> both living and dead. St.
<HI>Augustin</HI> tells us the Rea∣son why <HI>Christ</HI> suffer'd her
not to touch him, was to wean her from all sensual and fleshly touching,
to teach her a new and true Touch; for her touching of his Body, which she
desir'd, would last but forty Days, and he therefore taught her another
Touch, that might serve to the World's End.</P>
<P>But St. <HI>Gregory</HI> says, <HI>Christ</HI>'s forbid∣ding her
to touch him, was to save Time, he being desirous to dispatch her upon an
Errand better pleasing to him, and that requir'd more haste; he was
care∣ful that his Friends might receive Com∣fort with the first, and
therefore he bids her go with all speed, for that it would do <HI>them</HI>
more good, to hear of his Ri∣sing, <PB N="203" REF="242"/> than it would do
<HI>her</HI> to stand and touch him. It was a great Honour to <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> to be the Messenger of these blessed Tydings, there is
no harsh Term in this Message; for tho' his Di∣sciples fled from him,
forsook him, and forswore him, he hath forgotten and for∣given all, he does
not cast them off, as they did him, but sends to them by the Name of
<HI>Brethren:</HI> But this special Ho∣nour that was done to <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> was withall a silent blaming the Disci∣ples, for sitting
at Home so drooping in a Corner, that <HI>Christ</HI> not finding any of
them, is feign to seek a new <HI>Apostle,</HI> and finding her where he
should have found them and did not, to send to them by the Hand of her whom
he first found at the Sepulcher, and by this <HI>Mary Mag∣dalen</HI> ought to
be satisfied; for to be thus sent to be the Messenger of these
blessed Tydings is a more special Ho∣nour done to her, than if she had
been let alone, and been admitted to touch <HI>Christ,</HI> which she so
eagerly desir'd; for we may be sure <HI>Christ</HI> would never have
enjoyn'd her to leave the better and take the worse, to forbear to touch him,
to make the more haste to them, if that had not then been the better
Employment. The Reason why <HI>Christ</HI> bids her go and tell them,
<HI>That I ascend,</HI> was, because <PB N="204" REF="243"/> he knew they
would say, Oh! He is risen, We shall have his Company again as we had
before; but by sending them word of his Ascending, he gave them warning
betimes, that he Rose not to make any Abode with them, or to Con∣verse with
them on Earth, as formerly he had done. He knew this would be a hard
Lesson, and would trouble them much, for they were still over addicted to
his Bodily Being with them; here they would have detain'd him, built him a
Tabernacle here, and by their good Will, would never have let him go from
hence.</P>
<P>This was their Error, and to rid them of this Earthly Mind, thus
striving to affix him, and keep him here on Earth, he shews them they were
much mistaken, and sets them right: When <HI>Christ</HI> was risen, he
was not far from ascending, and if we be risen with him, we must no more
look down into the Grave, nor fix our selves on Earth, but strive to
ascend with him also.</P>
<P>All Things in <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> do so, rising
they ascend presently: In <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> the <HI>Stars</HI> are no
sooner risen above the <HI>Horizon,</HI> but they are in their As∣cent,
and never leave ascending, till they come to the highest <HI>Vertical</HI>
Point. In <PB N="205" REF="244"/> <HI>Earth,</HI> the little Spires that peep
out of the Ground now at this Time (Na∣ture's time of her Yearly
Resurrection) they are no sooner out but up they shoot, and never leave
to aspire till they have attain'd the full Pitch of the Growth al∣low'd them
by Nature; so should we from our Birth always ascend, nor ever stop,
till we reach the highest Perfection our Nature is capable of.</P>
<P>In our selves it is not strange for earth∣ly Men to have earthly
Minds, and ha∣ving Clay for our Original, that our Souls should cleave to the
Dust; so it is with us, tho' so it ought not to be: The very <HI>Heathen
Poet</HI> saw, that tho' we be made <HI>of</HI> Earth, we are not made
<HI>for</HI> Earth: That an <HI>Heavenly Soul</HI> was not put into an
<HI>earthly Body,</HI> to the end the earthly Body should draw it down to the
<HI>Earth</HI>; but rather that the Soul should lift it up to Heaven, and
so much is shewn by our <HI>os sublime &amp; vultus ad sydera,</HI> the
very Frame of our Body that bears us up thi∣therward; for tho' we are born in
this World and live in it, yet we belong to another Corporation, we are
Denizens of another Country, and Free of that <HI>City</HI> which is above,
whose Builder is the <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="245"/>Thus we see by what happened to <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> and the other devour Women, that they were not only capa∣ble of
Religious Offices, but that they were <HI>early</HI> in their Religious Work,
they began <HI>betimes.</HI> There is but one <HI>Pa∣rable</HI> that tells us,
That they that came <HI>late</HI> to the Labour, were as well re∣warded as the
<HI>earliest,</HI> and that is no Encouragement to late Comers, as not so
much respecting the different Ages of a Man, but different Year of the World.
And let that <HI>Parable</HI> be understood after the Vulgar way of
interpreting it, yet we should remember that these that were call'd at the
last Hours came as soon as they were call'd. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and
these Women, were also earnest and se∣dulous; and tho' their Devotion
was carried upon Things that could not be intirely done, yet <HI>God</HI>
cast no Cloud of Discouragement upon them, but exalted and maintain'd their
Holy Confidence, and accepted their Devotion; for where the Root and
Substance of the Work is Piety, <HI>God</HI> often overlooks some Errors in
Circumstance as inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Let therefore <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> be our Pattern, let us learn
from her, that we may find <HI>Christ</HI>; if we seek him <HI>early</HI>
and diligently, we shall meet him: Let <PB N="207" REF="246"/> us learn of her
to fear no Dangers in quest of <HI>Christ,</HI> and to think of no
Com∣forts without him; let us rise with her in the Morning of our good
Motions, and let them not sleep in Sloath, when Diligence may execute them;
let us run with Repentance to our sinful Hearts, which instead of being
<HI>Temples</HI> (thro' our Faults) are become <HI>Tombs</HI> to
<HI>Christ:</HI> Let us roll away the Stone of our former Hardness, remove
all heavy Loads of <HI>Sin</HI> that oppress us, and look into our Souls,
whether we can there find <HI>Christ</HI>; If he be not there within us, let
us stand Weeping without, and see him in other Creatures; seek him, and
not his, seek him for himself, and not for his Gifts; If our <HI>Faith</HI>
have found <HI>Christ</HI> in a Cloud, let our <HI>Hope</HI> seek to see
him: If our <HI>Hope</HI> hath led us to see him, let our <HI>Love</HI>
seek farther into him: Let us seek him truly, and no other for him; seek
him purely, and no other Thing with him; seek him only, and nothing besides
him; and if at the first Search he appear not, think not much to persevere
in Tears, and to continue our seeking as <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> did. Let us
stand upon the Earth, tread under us all worldly Vani∣ties, and touch them
only with the Soals of our Feet; that is, with the lowest 
<PB N="208" REF="247"/> and least part of our Affections; and to look better
into the <HI>Tomb,</HI> let us bow down our Necks to the Yoak of Humi∣lity,
that with lowly Looks we may find him, whom swelling and haughty Thoughts
have driven away: And if we can perceive in the Tombs of our Hearts, the
Presence of <HI>Christ</HI>'s two first Messen∣gers; that is, at the
Feet, Sorrow for the bad that is past; and at the Head, Desire to a better
that is to come; en∣tertain them with Sighs, and welcome them with Penitent
Tears, and let us not cease seeking till we find <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Thus preparing our selves with Dili∣gence, coming with Speed,
standing with fix'd Hopes, and stooping with humble Hearts, if we crave
with <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> no other Thing of Jesus but <HI>Jesus</HI>
himself, he will answer our Tears with his Presence, and continue with us
for ever.</P>

<HEAD>Of the LIFE and CONVERSION of St. <HI>Paul.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>T. <HI>PAƲL</HI> was born at <HI>Tar∣sus,</HI> the Metropolis
of <HI>Ci∣licia,</HI> a City vastly <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>populous,</HI>
wherein an <HI>Aca∣demy</HI> was furnished with Schools of Learning, where
there were Schollars that excelled in all Parts of Polite Literature. Those
of other Pla∣ces, and even <HI>Rome</HI> it self, was behold∣en to it, as
<HI>Strabo</HI> tells us, for many of its best Professors, and therefore
it was made a <HI>Roman Munificium,</HI> invested with many Privileges, by
<HI>Julius Caesar</HI> and <HI>Augustus,</HI> who granted to its
Inhabitants, the Honours and Immunities of <HI>Citizens</HI> of
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The Parents of St. <HI>Paul</HI> were <HI>Jews</HI> of the Tribe of
<HI>Benjamin</HI>; we find him described in Scripture by two Names, the one
<HI>Hebrew,</HI> the other <HI>Latin,</HI> pro∣bably referring both to his
<HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Capacity; the one <HI>Saul,</HI> a Name
frequent in the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> ever <PB N="210" REF="249"/> since
the first <HI>King of Israel</HI> of that Name was chosen out of that
<HI>Tribe:</HI> In Me∣mory whereof they were wont to give their Children that
Name at their <HI>Cir∣cumcision:</HI> His other Name <HI>Paul</HI> was
<HI>assum'd</HI> by him as some think at his Con∣version, to shew his
Humility, tho' others think he had two Names given him at his Circumcision,
<HI>Saul</HI> relating to his <HI>Jewish</HI> Original, and <HI>Paul</HI>
referring to the <HI>Roman</HI> Corporation where he was born: Or if this Name
was taken by him afterwards, it was probably done at his Conversion,
according to the Custom of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> who us'd many Times upon
extraordinary Occasions, especial∣ly upon entring into a more strict and
religious Course of Life, to change their Names for new ones; which is also
usual with our <HI>Religious</HI> in some Orders, to change their Names,
following therein this <HI>Apostle,</HI> who chang'd his Name from
<HI>Saul</HI> to <HI>Paul</HI> after his coming into the Ministry; and yet
some think he bor∣row'd that Name from <HI>Sergius Paulus</HI> the <HI>Roman
Lieutenant</HI>; But St. <HI>Chryso∣stom</HI> tells us, it was from his low
Stature, being but three Cubits high; and there∣fore says, <HI>Tricubitatis
ille, tamen coelum ascendit:</HI> I will not presume to clear this
Difficulty, but leave it to better Judg∣ments.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="250"/><HI>Saul</HI> in his Youth was brought up in
the <HI>Schools</HI> of <HI>Tarsus,</HI> fully instructed in all the
<HI>Liberal Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences:</HI> He was also Taught a particular
Trade, ac∣cording to the <HI>known</HI> Maxim and Prin∣ciple of the <HI>Jews,
That he who does not teach his Son a Trade, learns him to be a Thief.</HI> They
thought it not only fit, but a necessary Part of Education, for the
wisest and most learned <HI>Rabbins</HI> to be brought up to Manual
Trades, where∣by, if there was Occasion, they might be able to maintain
themselves; which Custom was taken up by the <HI>Christians,</HI>
especially by the <HI>Monks</HI> of Primitive Times, and is continued to this
Day a∣mongst the Reformed Orders in <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Church</HI>; who
together with their strict Profession, and almost incredible
Exer∣cises of Devotion, many take upon them particular Trades, whereat they
daily Work, not for maintaining themselves in particular, but for the Benefit
of their whole Community. The Trade of <HI>Saul</HI> was that of a
<HI>Tent-maker,</HI> whereat he Wrought, even after he was call'd to be an
<HI>Apostle</HI>; and tho' this was but a mean Course of Life, yet it was a
gainful Trade, especially in those Countries where frequent use was made
of Tents.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="251"/><HI>Saul</HI> having ran thro' the whole
Course of his Studies, and laid the sure Foun∣dations of human Learning at
<HI>Tarsus,</HI> he was by his Parents sent to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to be
perfected in the Study of the <HI>Law,</HI> and put under the Tutorage of
<HI>Gama∣liel,</HI> who was a <HI>Doctor of Law,</HI> and reckon'd a Person
of great Wisdom and Prudence, a Man of chief Note and Au∣thority in the
<HI>Jewish Sanhedrim,</HI> and <HI>President</HI> of it when our
<HI>Blessed Saviour</HI> was brought before it. Under this great Master
was <HI>Saul</HI> educated in the Know∣ledge of the <HI>Law,</HI> wherein he
made such large and quick Improvements, that he soon excell'd his Fellow
Pupils; and amongst the various Sects at that time in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
he was specially Edu∣cated in the Principles and Institutions of the
<HI>Pharisees,</HI> of which Sect was both his <HI>Father</HI> and
<HI>Master,</HI> whereof he became a most earnest and zealous
Pro∣fessor; and <HI>Josephus,</HI> tho' a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> gives this
following Character of them: 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 171.3.</NOTE>"That
they were a crafty and subtil Generation of Men, and so perverse even to
Princes themselves, that they would not fear many times to Affront and
Oppose them; and so far had they insinuated themselves into the
Affections and Estimations of the Po∣pulacy, <PB N="213" REF="252"/> that
their good or ill Word was enough to make or blast any one with the People,
who implicitely would believe them, let their Re∣port be never so false or
malicious:"</Q> Certain it is, They were infinitely Proud and Insolent, Surly
and Ill-natur'd, they hated all Mankind but themselves, and censur'd
those who would not be of their Opinion and Way, as Reprobates. They were
extream zealous to gather Proselytes to their Party, not to make them more
Religious, but more fierce and cruel, (much like some, who think all
<HI>Religion</HI> confin'd within the Bounds of their own Sect, that none but
they were the Godly, and that all other Per∣sons were <HI>Sons of the
Earth</HI>) and there∣fore they endeavour'd especially to In∣spire all
their Party with a mighty Zeal and Fervency against all that differed from
them; so that if any did but speak a good Word of our Blessed Saviour,
he should presently be prosecuted to Death.</P>
<P>These dogged and ill-natur'd Princi∣ples, together with their
unmerciful Be∣haviour, they endeavour'd to varnish over with a more than
ordinary Pretence and Profession of <HI>Religion,</HI> and were
especially diligent, in what cost them lit∣tle, <PB N="214" REF="253"/> the
outward Instances of Religion, as frequent Fasting, long Praying, with
demure and mortify'd Looks, in a whin∣ing and affected Tone. <HI>Saul</HI> was
deep∣ly leavened with the active and fiery Genius of this Sect, not able to
bear with any opposite Party in Religion, e∣specially if late or new;
insomuch, that when the <HI>Jews</HI> were resolved to do Execution upon
St. <HI>Stephen, Saul</HI> stood by and kept the Cloaths of them that did it;
whether he was any farther en∣gaged in his Death, we know not; but this was
enough, loudly to proclaim his Approbation and Consent, for <HI>God</HI>
chief∣ly respects the Heart; and if the Vote be passed there, that writes
the Man guilty, tho' he stirs no farther, it being easie to murther a Man
by a silent Wish, or a passionate Desire. In all Moral Actions,
<HI>God</HI> judges by the Will, and reckons the Man a Companion in the Sin,
who, tho' possibly he may never actu∣ally join in it, does yet inwardly
applaud and like it.</P>
<P>The Storm thus begun, increas'd a∣pace, and a violent Persecution
began to rise, which miserably afflicted and dis∣perst the
<HI>Christians</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in which <HI>Saul</HI> was a
Prime Agent, raging about in all Parts with a furious and ungovern∣able 
<PB N="215" REF="254"/> Zeal, searching out the <HI>Christians,</HI> beating
them in the <HI>Synagogues,</HI> com∣pelling many to Blaspheme, imprisoning
others, and procuring their Death: He was a sort of <HI>Inquisitor</HI> to
the <HI>High Priest,</HI> by whom he was employ'd to find out those
<HI>Christians</HI> who preach'd against the <HI>Law</HI> of
<HI>Moses</HI>; and after having made a strange Havock at
<HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> he addressed himself to the <HI>Sanhe∣drim,</HI>
and there took out a Commission to go down and ransack the
<HI>Synagogue</HI> at <HI>Damascus,</HI> where many <HI>Christians</HI>
that were persecuted fled for Shelter, <HI>Saul</HI> resolving to bring up
those he found there to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in order to their Punishment
and Execution: But <HI>God</HI> who designed him for a Work of ano∣ther
Nature, stopt him in his Journey; for as he was travelling with his
Com∣panions upon the Road, not far from <HI>Damascus,</HI> on a sudden, a
Gleam of Light, which exceeded the Splendor of the Sun, darted from Heaven upon
them, whereat being very strangely amaz'd and confounded, they all fell to
the Ground, and a Voice call'd to him, say∣ing, <HI>Saul, Saul, Why
persecutest thou me?</HI> To which he reply'd, <HI>Lord, Who art thou?</HI>
Who told him, He was <HI>Jesus</HI> whom he persecuted, because what was 
<PB N="216" REF="255"/> done to the Members, was done to the Head, that it was
hard for him to kick against the Pricks: That he now ap∣pear'd to him, to
make Choice of him for an <HI>Apostle,</HI> and Witness of what he had now
seen, and should after hear, that he would stand by him, and pre∣serve
him, and make him a glorious Instrument for the Conversion of the
<HI>Gentiles:</HI> This said, he asked our <HI>Lord,</HI> What he would have
him to do? Who bad him go into the <HI>City,</HI> where he should receive his
Answer. <HI>Saul</HI>'s Com∣panions, who were present at this
Dis∣course, heard a confused Sound, but no distinct articulate Voice,
neither saw they him that spoke to <HI>Saul</HI>; and pro∣bably they being
Ignorant of the <HI>He∣brew</HI> Language, wherein <HI>Christ</HI> spoke to
<HI>Saul,</HI> they heard the Words, but knew not the Meaning of them.</P>
<P>Thus, when <HI>Saul</HI> was wasting the <HI>Church,</HI>
dispersing the Disciples, destroy∣ing the Christians, following them
from the <HI>Synagogues</HI> into the Streets, from thence into their Houses,
when he breath∣ed out Threatnings and Slaughter; the <HI>Lord</HI> without any
Expostulation might have poured down Vengeance upon him, he might have
commanded what Punish∣ment he pleas'd to have serv'd the Exe∣cution 
<PB N="217" REF="256"/> of Wrath against him: But if ever <HI>Mercy</HI> and
<HI>Judgment</HI> met together, here it was, <HI>Judicium misericordiae,
&amp; misericordia judicis,</HI> a Voice and a Stroak, the one striking
down to <HI>Earth,</HI> the other lifting up to <HI>Heaven,</HI> a Light
shin∣ing from <HI>Heaven,</HI> and a Light shining to direct him to
<HI>Heaven,</HI> a Light shin∣ing to him that was in Darkness and in the
Shadow of Death, to bring him from the Snare of Darkness into the glorious
Liberty of the Sons of <HI>God:</HI> He that was the <HI>Way</HI> met him in
the <HI>Way,</HI> he that was the <HI>Light</HI> met him with a <HI>Light,</HI>
he that was the <HI>Word</HI> met him with the Voice of a Word, <HI>Saul, Saul,
Why per∣secutest thou me?</HI></P>
<P>It was a gracious Favour of the <HI>Lord</HI> to vouchsafe to
Question with him; but to call him by his Name, and to inge∣minate that Name,
that was a sign of his great Affection and Commiseration: It was a Voice
indeed, the Voice of the <HI>Lord,</HI> mighty in Operation: This Voice
struck him from his Horse to the <HI>Earth,</HI> struck him from his
Presumption, <HI>Per∣secutest thou me?</HI> Yet the Voice was not more
<HI>Powerful</HI> than <HI>Merciful:</HI> It was (as <HI>Chrysologus</HI>
says) <HI>Suaviter fortis, &amp; fortiter suavis</HI>; the heaviest Fall,
and yet the happiest Fall that ever any had; <PB N="218" REF="257"/> it was
his Fall and his Rising. Thus a Dumbness unto <HI>Zachary,</HI> was not a
dumb Instructor, it taught him Faith against another time; so
<HI>Blindness</HI> sent unto <HI>Saul,</HI> took away his
<HI>Blindness,</HI> making him see more in the Ways of Life, than all his
Learning gather'd at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> could have Re∣vealed unto
him</P>
<P><HI>Saul</HI> by this time was gotten up, but tho' he found his
<HI>Feet,</HI> he lost his <HI>Eyes,</HI> being struck Blind with the
extraordi∣nary Brightness of the <HI>Light,</HI> and was therefore led by his
Companions into <HI>Damascus,</HI> in which Condition he there remained three
Days together Fasting; and at this Time we may probably sup∣pose it was,
that he had the Vision and Extasie mention'd by him.</P>
<P>There was at this time at <HI>Damascus, Ananias,</HI> one of the
Seventy Disciples, a very Devout Man, and probably the first Planter of the
<HI>Christian Church</HI> in <HI>Damascus,</HI> and tho' a
<HI>Christian,</HI> yet of great Repute amongst the <HI>Jews:</HI> To him
<HI>Christ</HI> appear'd, and directed him to the Street and House where
<HI>Saul</HI> of <HI>Tarsus</HI> then Lodged, who was then at Prayers, and
had seen him in a Vision coming to him, to lay his Hands upon him, that he
might receive his Sight; <PB N="219" REF="258"/> <HI>Ananias</HI> startled at
the Name of <HI>Saul,</HI> having heard of his bloody Temper and Practices,
knowing upon what Errand he was come to that City, was sore afraid: But
<HI>Jesus</HI> quickly made his Fears vanish, by telling him he mistook
the Man, that he was now become a chosen Vessel to Preach the
<HI>Gospel</HI> both to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> and before the
greatest <HI>Potentates</HI> of the Earth, telling him what great Things he
should do and suffer for his Sake. Hereupon <HI>Ananias</HI> went
forth∣with to him, laid his Hands upon him, and told him, <HI>Jesus</HI> had
sent him to him, that he might receive his Sight, and be filled with the
<HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> which was no sooner said but done, and thick Films
like Scales fell from his <HI>Eyes,</HI> and his <HI>Sight</HI> return'd; then
he was Baptiz'd and solemnly initiated into the <HI>Christian Faith</HI>;
after which, he soon joyn'd him∣self to the Disciples of that Place, to
the great Joy and Wonder of the <HI>Church,</HI> that the <HI>Wolf</HI>
should so soon become a <HI>Lamb.</HI> He that was the Mouth of
Blas∣phemy, is become the Mouth of Christ: He that was the Instrument of
<HI>Satan,</HI> the Organ of the Holy Ghost: As says St.
<HI>Chrysostome, Being yet upon the Earth, he is an Angel; and being yet
but a Man, he is already in Heaven.</HI> What was <PB N="220" REF="259"/> done
upon him wrought upon all the World; he was struck Blind, and all the World
saw the better for it.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> calls him a <HI>Ʋniversal
Priest,</HI> that Sacrificed not <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Goats,</HI> but even
himself; and not only that prepar'd the whole World as a Sacrifice to
<HI>God,</HI> but so absolutely did he Sacrifice himself and his State in
this World, as that he chose rather to be <HI>Anathema,</HI> separated from
<HI>Christ,</HI> than that they should; but whether that was not out of an
over vehement and incon∣siderate Zeal to his Bretheren, is too <HI>high</HI>
a Point for me to undertake to judge.</P>
<P>After these Words, <HI>Saul, Saul, Why persecutest thou
me?</HI> he was no longer <HI>Saul,</HI> there was an immediate change of
Affections: Here's another manner of Lycanthropy, than when a Lamb is made a
Wolf; for here is a Wolf made a Lamb, a Bramble is made a Vine, un∣profitable
Tares become good Wheat, and the last is made first: He that was Born out
of Time, hath not only the Perfection, but the Excellency of all his
Lineaments. <HI>Saul</HI> was breathing Threat∣nings and Slaughter against
the <HI>Church,</HI> when he was in the height of his Fury, <HI>Christ</HI>
laid hold on him; this was for the <PB N="221" REF="260"/> most part
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Method of Curing: When the <HI>Sea</HI> was in a
tempestuous Rage, when the Waters cover'd the Ship, and even shaked that
which could re∣move Mountains, even the Faith of the Disciples, then
<HI>Christ</HI> rebukes the Wind and commands a <HI>Calm</HI>: When the
<HI>Sun</HI> was gone out as a <HI>Gyant</HI> to run his Course, (as
<HI>David</HI> speaks) then <HI>God</HI> by the Mouth of another
<HI>Josuah,</HI> bids the <HI>Sun</HI> stand still: When the un∣clean
Spirit foam'd and fum'd, tore and rent the possessed Persons, then
<HI>Christ</HI> commanded them to go out: <HI>Christ</HI> staid not here
till <HI>Saul</HI> being made drunk with Blood was cast into a Slumber, as
satis∣fied with the Blood of <HI>Christians,</HI> in the midst of his
Fit Christ gave him Phy∣sick, in the heat of his Madness he re∣claims
him.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives this Evidence against himself, <HI>I
persecuted this way unto Death</HI>; What could he say more against
himself? And then says <HI>Christ</HI> to this Tempest be
<HI>quiet,</HI> to this glaring <HI>Sun</HI> stand <HI>still,</HI> to this
unclean Spirit <HI>come forth</HI> And in this Sense St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls
himself <HI>aborti∣vum,</HI> a Person born out of Season: For whereas the
other <HI>Disciples</HI> and <HI>Apostles</HI> had a sort of a Growth
under <HI>Christ,</HI> and were first his <HI>Disciples,</HI> and after
his <HI>Apostles:</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> was born a Man, an 
<PB N="222" REF="261"/> Apostle, not carved out as the rest in Time, but an
<HI>Apostle</HI> poured out, and cast in a Mould, as <HI>Adam</HI> was a
perfect Man in an instant; so was St <HI>Paul</HI> an Apostle, so
soon as <HI>Christ</HI> took him in Hand: For St. <HI>Paul</HI> was not in
the Number of the <HI>Apostles</HI> at the Descent the <HI>Holy
Ghost</HI>; But then he had more than an equivalent Evidence of his
Mis∣sion; For when he travel'd from <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> to
<HI>Damascus,</HI> the Heavens were open'd, and our <HI>Blessed
Saviour</HI> himself spake to him, whereupon the Company were
astonished, and St. <HI>Paul</HI> struck Blind with the Glory of the
Vision; and afterwards being cured by a Miracle at <HI>Damascus,</HI> he
had no Assistance from the rest of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> his
Instructions came all from <HI>Christ</HI> immediately. And it cannot be
deny'd that St. <HI>Paul</HI> in some Kind, and upon some Subjects, is as
Elo∣quent as ever Man was, not inferior to <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> whom some
think he had read, or some other excellent <HI>Orators.</HI> His Speech to
<HI>Agrippa</HI> hath as much Force and Address, and much more Great∣ness
of Mind and noble Freedom, than any thing we meet with in the best of the
Heathen <HI>Orators:</HI> 'Tis true, the Advantage of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
Education was great, he had his <HI>Cause</HI> and his <HI>Master</HI> to
assist him, but yet he met with great <PB N="223" REF="262"/> Difficulties
and Hazards in the Execu∣tion of his Function: For he was to oppose the
Religion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> to alter the Customs which <HI>Moses</HI>
had de∣livered, and to decry the Expectation of a <HI>Temporal
Messiah</HI>; he charged them with the highest Crimes imaginable, and
told them plainly, That they had be∣tray'd the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the World,
and kill'd the <HI>Prince of Life:</HI> And this he told the obstinate
<HI>Jews,</HI> who were hard∣ned in Prejudice, and bigotted to Error and
Superstition, for which they pleaded Antiquity: St. <HI>Paul</HI> declar'd to
the <HI>San∣hedrim,</HI> that <HI>Jesus</HI> whom they had mur∣ther'd was
rais'd from the Dead, was a <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Saviour,</HI> and that it
was from <HI>him</HI> they were to expect Remission of their Sins; with
this severe sharpness St. <HI>Paul</HI> treated <HI>Faelix</HI> Viceroy
of <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI> to whom he talked so freely and so pertinently, that
the Viceroy forgot his Character, and <HI>trembled</HI> before him.</P>
<P>And yet the Truth is, the Beginnings of our <HI>Religion</HI> were
very unpromising; the first Undertakers began with a slen∣der Force, and
there was a strange Dis∣proportion between the Cause and the Effect; for
humanly speaking, if <HI>twelve private Men</HI> should now make an
Expe∣dition against the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> they would in all Probility
be as likely to suc∣ceed, <PB N="224" REF="263"/> as the <HI>Apostles</HI>
were in their En∣terprize when our <HI>Saviour</HI> left them. But herein
certainly the Providence of God, for the Prevention of all Doubts and Scruples
was great, in that he would not lay the Foundation of <HI>Christian
Re∣ligion,</HI> as not in the force of Arms, so neither of Eloquence and
artificial Speech, which is often insisted upon by St. <HI>Paul, Not with
Wisdom, nor the Ex∣cellency of Speech, nor with enticing Words:</HI> And it
is worthy our Conside∣ration, how it was possible for a few poor Men,
so low in <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Edu∣cation,</HI> to break through the
Opposition of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> bafle their Learn∣ing,
despise their Powers, and make them renounce their <HI>Ancient</HI> Belief,
and that Life they were most in love with. But tho' they were short in
their natural Capacities, their wonderful Suc∣cess is an undeniable Proof of
a <HI>Di∣vine Power</HI> that assisted them; as <HI>Chry∣sologus</HI>
most admirably tells us. <HI>Petrus &amp; Andreas, Jacobus &amp; Joannes,
ger∣manitas combinata, ingeminata paupe∣ras, in Apostolorum principes
eliguntur, pauperes censu, loco humiles, viles arte, obscuri vitâ,
labore communes, addicti vigiliis, fluctibus mancipati, negati ho∣noribus,
injuriis dati, sed in istis quan∣tùm vilis mundanus videbatur
aspectus,</HI> <PB N="225" REF="264"/> <HI>praetiosus tantùm animas
Dei intuitus tunc ridebat. Erant censu pauperes, sed innocentiâ
locupletes, loco humiles, sed sanctitate sublimes, viles arte, sed
simplicitate praetiosi, obscuri vitâ, sed vitae merito
perlucentes, labore com∣munes, sed proposito singulares, addicti
vigiliis, sed ad coelestes victorias jam vocati, fluctibus mancipati, sed
fluctibus non demersi, negati honoribus, dicati magis honoribus, non negati,
injuriis dati, sed non injuriis relicti. Pertrus Chrysologus. Sermo</HI>
28. which shew the particular Gifts that Christ had given to his
Apostles.</P>
<P>Now to magnifie his <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> more
particularly to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and to take away all Occasion of
Despair, <HI>Christ</HI> did upon so many great Disadvantages draw St.
<HI>Paul</HI> to him, whom he brought to that remarkable height on a sudden,
that the <HI>Church</HI> celebrates the Conver∣sion of no Man but this: She
does not consider the <HI>Martyrs</HI> as Born till they Die, till the World
see how they per∣sever'd to the End, she takes no Know∣ledge of them:
Wherefore she calls the Days of their <HI>Death,</HI> their
<HI>Birth-Days:</HI> She does not reckon they are <HI>Born</HI> till they
<HI>Die:</HI> But of St. <HI>Paul</HI> she makes assur'd the first Day,
nay the first Mi∣nute, <PB N="226" REF="265"/> the first Moment, and
therefore celebrates his <HI>Conversion</HI> only. And as <HI>Christ</HI>
dealt with St <HI>Paul,</HI> so <HI>God</HI> deals with <HI>us,</HI> he will
first cast us down be∣fore he will raise us up, he will first break us
before he will make us in his Fashion. The <HI>Lord</HI> only knows how to
Wound us out of Love, more than that how to Wound us into Love, not only with
him that Wounds us, but into Love with the Wound it self, with the very
Affliction that he inflicts upon us. The <HI>Lord</HI> knows how to strike us
so, that we shall lay hold on the Hand that strikes us, and kiss the
Instrument that wounds us: <HI>God</HI> brings to the Gate of <HI>Death,</HI>
and by that Gate he leads us to eternal Life: He kills us here that we may live
for ever; he puts us low here that we may be exalted hereafter: And he hath not
discover'd, but made that Northern Passage to pass from that <HI>Frozen
Sea</HI> of Calamity and Tribulation, to the heaven∣ly <HI>Jerusalem.</HI>
There are some Fruits that ripen not without <HI>Frosts</HI>; there are
some Natures that dispose not themselves to <HI>God</HI> but by
<HI>Afflictions</HI>; And as <HI>Na∣ture</HI> looks for the Season, and does
not produce any Thing before; so <HI>Grace</HI> looks for the
<HI>Assent</HI> of the <HI>Soul,</HI> and does not perfect the
<HI>whole</HI> Work, till <PB N="227" REF="266"/> that come. It is
<HI>Nature</HI> that brings the Season, but <HI>Grace</HI> the
<HI>Assent,</HI> and till the Season for the Fruit, till the Assent
of the Soul come, all is not done.</P>
<P>This should be our <HI>Consolation,</HI> that how low soever
<HI>God</HI> is pleas'd to cast us, tho' it be to the <HI>Earth,</HI> yet he
doth not do it to cast us down, but to bring us home. And <HI>Death</HI> it
self is not so much a <HI>banishing</HI> us out of this World, as it is a
Visitation of our <HI>Friends</HI> that lie in the <HI>Earth</HI>; neither
are any nearer of Kin to us than the Earth it self, and the Worms of the
<HI>Earth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of NOBILITY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>BSERVING the several Alterations in Nobility, we shall find
Four Principal Actors on the Theatres of Great Families: The Be∣ginner,
Advancer, Continuer, and Ruiner. The Beginner, is he, who either by his
Virtues, Merits, or Riches, refineth himself from the Dross of the Vulgar,
and layeth the Foundation of his House: An excellent Workman in∣deed, who not
only brings his Tools, but maketh his Materials: But yet An∣cient Nobility
seems no just Ground to be Proud, and have a high Opinion of our selves,
because it's borrow'd. Those great Actions, wherein we had no Share, cannot
be any part of our Commenda∣tion, especially if we have not Abilities to
imitate them; 
<Q> 
<L>Et genus &amp; proavos &amp; quae non ferimus ipsi,</L> 
<L>Vix ea nostra voco.</L></Q> <PB N="229" REF="268"/> That Man
must be very Poor, who hath nothing of his own to appear in, but must Patch
up his Pedigree with the Relicks of the Dead, and with the Tomb-stones and
Monuments of his Ancestors. Next comes the Advancer of Nobility, who improves
the Patri∣mony of Honour he receiveth, and what his Ancestor found Glass
and made Cry∣stal, he finds Crystal and makes it Pearl: Indeed, if a Man
could bequeath his Virtues, Merits and Courage, by Will, and settle his good
Sense, Learning and Resolution, upon his Children, as cer∣tainly as he can
his Lands, a brave An∣cestor would be a mighty Privilege and great Advantage
to his Posterity. Next is the Continuer of Nobility, who keep∣eth his
Nobility alive, and passes it to his Children, neither marring nor mending
it, but sends it to his Son as he receiv'd it from his Father: Now this
Advantage only by Birth is often the effect of a Sloathful and Effeminate Life,
when Men will attempt nothing, either in the Field, or in their Closets; when
they will neither Trouble themselves with Study; nor be contented to expose
themselves to the Weather, which Laziness renders them insignificant to
the great Purposes of Life; such Men think it a great <PB N="230" REF="269"/> Addition to their Birth, to stand at the Bottom of a long
Parchment Pedigree, and that their Blood hath run through the Channels of
Honour for many Ages: But alas! This Antiquity consists only in the
continual Frugality of the Family, who being once possest of an Estate,
had the Discretion to keep it, and so hath the Advantage of Living in a
better House, and Eating and Drinking better than those who want a Fortune.
Indeed, if Ancient Nobility did convey to us any Advantage of Body or Mind, and
that every Generation grew wiser, stronger, handsomer, or longer-liv'd
than other; if the Breed of a Man's Family were thus improv'd, then indeed the
Quality of their Arms would be contrary to their Cloaths, the one would always
grow better, the other worse for Wearing. The last is the Ruiner of
Families, who basely degenerates from his Ancestors; so that Nobility in
him hath run so far from its first Starting that it's tired, and whilst
he lives he is no better than his Grandfather's Tomb, without carv'd over with
honourable Titles, within full of Emptiness and Corruption: Such noble Men as
these last, look upon it as one of the best Perfections of Nature, to
Dress themselves well, and to come <PB N="231" REF="270"/> handsomly into
a Room; but let me tell these Ceremony-Gentlemen, that I think it much
better, that a Man's Parts should lie in his Head rather than in his Heels.
Indeed, in some Persons well-born there is a peculiar Nobleness of Temper
in them. A Man may distinguish their Quality by the Air of their Faces,
which are good Accomplishments, and recom∣mend them to Company with some
Ad∣vantage; but then Men must not be fond of these small Formalities, nor
magnifie them too much. I know in <HI>England,</HI> that a plain Gentleman of
an ancient Family is accounted a Person of better Quality than a new made
Knight, tho' the Reason of their Knighthood was ne∣ver so Meritorious; and
therefore many such Gentlemen have refus'd to be Knighted, but I think they
were much in the wrong: For the Reason why those who are placed in that
Degree of Honour, precede others who are afterwards rai∣sed in the same
height, is for Encourage∣ment of Industry, to make Men for∣ward to exert
their earliest Endeavours to deserve well of the Prince or State. It is but
reasonable, that Merit should be consider'd, of what Date soever it is,
and a worthy Action ought as well to be consider'd and rewarded, as one 
<PB N="232" REF="271"/> of the same Kind was a thousand Years since: If
the Inheritors of Ancient Ho∣nour have not by Personal Additions im∣prov'd
that Stock which was granted to their Ancestors, there is no Reason it
should be valued above the same Degree (Precedency excepted) which is given
now: For to affirm, That a Family rais'd to Nobility by King <HI>Charles</HI>
or King <HI>James,</HI> is not as good as one rais'd by the Conqueror, is a
Reflection upon those Kings; and it supposes their Judg∣ment and
Authority less considerable, and that the Fountain of Honour is dried up.
Honour is not like <HI>China</HI> Dishes, which must lie some Ages under
Ground before it comes to any Perfe∣ction. In taking a true Esteem of
No∣bility, we are not so much to consider its Antiquity, as the Merit of
him to whom it was first granted, and the Di∣stinction which the Prince put
upon it.</P>
<P>No Man will affirm an old Shilling to be better than a new
Half-Crown, or an old brass Medal dug out of the Ground long since, to be
more Valua∣ble than the same Weight in Gold. If a Man were to pay a Debt, the
late King <HI>James</HI>'s Image upon a Piece of Gold would be more
serviceable to him than <HI>Caesar</HI>'s old Coins, which are only valu'd 
<PB N="233" REF="272"/> for their Usefulness, because they often rectify
Chronology, and explain Hi∣story, and retrieve us several material Parts of
Learning, which had otherwise been lost.</P>
<P>Conquerors made Soldiers ambitious to follow them, by sharing the
Fruits of their Conquests with them; and when their Successors had not
Estates suffici∣ent to Reward all the glorious Actions and eminent Services
which Persons did for them, being persuaded that a Man of Courage values
nothing so much as Honour, which distinguishes him from other Men, they
invented Knighthood, which without exhausting their Trea∣sure, would gain
them the Honour of their Subjects, and inflame all others with an extream
Desire to make them∣selves worthy of the same Honour; and it was for this
Reason that they created Knights, either just before the Battle to make
them ingage more resolutely, or presently after it, to recompence those
that had the greatest Hand in the Vi∣ctory. Thus Nobility is a Quality
ac∣quir'd by virtuous Actions and emi∣nent Services, which some Persons
have performed to the Prince and State; and tho' Fortune should have more
Influence than Merit, upon the dispensing of these <PB N="234" REF="273"/>
Qualities, yet the same Judgment is still to be made, because Princes are
subject to their Passions, rewarding more boun∣tifully and raising
higher some of their Servants than others: But if a Man be advanced for
engaging himself in an un∣just Quarrel, he hath no better Pretence to
Honour than a resolute Highwayman may challenge; and the Marks of all Favours
that either come by servile Flat∣tery, or a dextrous Application to the Vices
of their Princes, are rather infa∣mous than honourable to their Posteri∣ty,
being enobled for those Qualities for which they should have been
pu∣nish'd: It is a lessening to a Man's No∣bility when the Reasons or
Grounds of it are unknown, and when the first Prin∣ciples of Honour happen to
be thus Course and Counterfeit, 'tis not in the Power of Time to mend them,
when the Rise of a Family is owing to such an Original; a Man has a
particular Rea∣son not to flourish too much upon the Gifts of his Fortune,
since there is so much Alloy in it. Nobility rais'd by Arms, when lawfully
undertaken, is cer∣tainly more great than that which comes by Commerce. The
Profession of a Soldier has a particular Title to Ho∣nour: It is more Noble
than the rest; <PB N="235" REF="274"/> and no wise Man will ever envy or
les∣sen the just Character of Military Glo∣ry: The Courage of a Soldier
does his Country not much Service after his Death; the Consequences of his
Valour seldom reach beyond his Death; so there are few the better for it
except those he engages for. A Martial Man, unless polish'd by Learning,
is usually sour in his Behaviour. The old Heroes were none of the
genteelest Men; <HI>A∣chilles,</HI> tho' a great Soldier, was very rugged and
morose in his Conversa∣tion. The Advantages of Learning are certainly very
great; without some share of this, War it self cannot be success∣ful;
nay, without the Assistance of Let∣ters, a Man can never be qualified for
any considerable Post in the Camp. For Courage without Conduct is not fit
to Command, and many times does more hurt than good. It is Learning that
teaches a General the Successes and Events of Actions in former Ages: It
instructs him how to take Advantage of his Enemies, and to avoid those
Miscar∣riages which have been fatal to others before him: It teaches him how
to For∣tifie and Assault, how to manage the Difference of Ground and
Weather; <PB N="236" REF="275"/> and the Advantages of Learning are more
lasting than those of Arms. Learn∣ing in a Commander is like a Diamond
set in Gold: I do not intend that a Commander should be versed in thor∣ny
School-Questions, but in History, which is a silent Study and reserv'd
Work: Those that are not versed in it, have Cricks in their Necks, and
can't look backward, nor see behind them the Actions which long since were
per∣form'd: History makes a young Man to be old, without gray Hairs, being
privileged with the Experience of Age, without the Infirmities or
Inconveni∣ences thereof: Nay, it is not only ma∣king Things past, present,
but inables one to make a rational Conjecture of Things to come: For this World
affords no new Accidents, but in the same Sense wherein we call it a New
Moon, which is the Old one in another shape, and yet no other than what hath
been formerly. Old Actions return again, furbished over with some new and
diffe∣rent Circumstances.</P>
<P>Those that are only Continuers of their Honour or Nobility,
deceive the Desires and Hopes of their Friends: Good is not good, when
proceeding <PB N="237" REF="276"/> from them, from whom far better is expected.
Youthful Virtues are so pro∣mising, that they cannot come off at riper Age
with Credit, without perform∣ing something that may advance the Honour of
their Family, and build their Houses one Story higher than they found
them.</P>
<P>If our Ancestors have gain'd Honour by the War, we should
enquire whether it were in a just Cause, and whether Enterprizes or
Advantages were gain'd by Bravery, or whether by Chance or Treachery; for a
great many Persons have ventur'd far, and yet continue in their first
Obscurity; and I have known some in my Time, that are now grown great Men,
only by having the good Fortune to fall under the Notice of their General, and
being sent by him with the good News of a Victory, they have been highly
Rewarded and Advanced. Such Men as these are thrown up Hill by another Man's
Arms, and made con∣siderable by Chance-Medly, their Me∣rits having been very
inconsiderable, or rather nothing at all, when other Men in the same Battle
perform'd much more signal Service than that former Person; yet their
Courage was never Rewarded, <PB N="238" REF="277"/> but lost in the Crowd and
Tumult of the Action, and got nothing but Blows for their Pains; whereas the
other are be∣come Great, not by their Genealogy, but by good Fortune, and
having their Tongues well hung, and telling their Story handsomely, which was
their great∣est Merit. Men that are thus preferr'd, should remember that
there were others which ventur'd further, and perform'd more considerable
Service, which mis∣carried as to any private Advantage, be∣cause they were
not so lucky to give an Account to him that was able to Re∣ward: So that we
daily see many Per∣sons, well furnish'd for Employments and Honour, go
out of the World, as obscurely as they came into it, only for want of a good
Occasion to bring them into Light: Now such Men as before∣mention'd, who
have receiv'd so valua∣ble Consideration for their small or no Services,
ought to acquiesce, and not press too much, being Gentlemen only of the
first Head, and should therefore manage their Advancement obligingly, for
by treating People roughly, they do but expose themselves, and reproach
their own former Condition.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="278"/>Now he that is truly Noble, hath far different
Sentiments, his Greatness is easie, obliging, and agreeable, so that none
have just Cause to wish him Less. He is sensible it is the Part of
true No∣bility to be affable in his Converse, and generous in his Temper: He
is equally remov'd from the extreams of Pride and Baseness, and as
Prosperity does not make him Haughty, so neither does Adversity make him
Demean himself, he scorns either to trample upon those below him, or to
cringe to the greatest Monarch.</P>
<P>Ancient Nobility is very glorious, when 'tis found with Virtue,
which adds new Splendour to the Honour of his House, and challenges Respect
from all; but Lewd Greatness is nothing but the Rigour of Vice, having both
Mind and Merits to be uncontroulably Lewd: And a debauched Son of a Noble
Family, is one of the intollerable Burthens of the Earth; and the good
Education he hath had, is an Auxiliary to his Shame, and the Brightness of
his Ancestors makes his Darkness more notorious. To be Good and Great is an
excellent Com∣mendation; but he is more to be valued that is Good whose
Father expired a <PB N="240" REF="279"/> Clown, than the vitious Son of the
great∣est Lord, tho' his Lineal Descent be never so high; For Virtue in a
Man of obscure Parents is like an unpolish'd Diamond which lies among
Pebbles, which tho' neglected by the Vulgar, yet the wise Lapidary takes it
up as a Jewel.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F Peace, as most believe, establishes the Throne of
Happiness, and safely guards it, 'tis Contentment alone that crowns it; if

with∣out endeavouring Safety he be his own Traytor, without enjoying
Contentment he is his own Troubler; the Discontented Man hath neither
Neighbour, nor Friend, nor indeed himself. 'Tis not in the rich Fool's Barns,
nor in <HI>Ahab</HI>'s ravish'd Vine∣yard, nor in <HI>Achitophel</HI>'s knack
of Wit, no nor in wiser <HI>Solomon</HI>'s dear-bought Experience; no, 'tis a
quiet Content∣ment of Spirit that a Man possesses him∣self. A Man may
pick a Quarrel with himself in the midst of all worldly Hap∣piness, 
<PB N="242" REF="281"/> without this Charm of Self-Con∣tentment: The Truth is,
Discontent is the Bone that the Devil throws into eve∣ry Man's Mouth to gnaw
upon, and break his Teeth with. You shall hard∣ly find any Man, that
complains not of some Want, tho' it be but Want of his own Will; Things go
not right, if they run not upon the vertiginous Wheels of his own Fancy; the
poor Man thinks the World unequally dealt, and the rich Man thinks so too,
because the Care, together with the Keys, hang so heavi∣ly about him; the
Schollar thinks the Soldier hath all the Money, and he a∣gain, that the other
hath all the Ease; the single Man wants a Wife, and the marry'd Man wants
no less in that he wants not a Wife; and Men strive to vexthemselves by
their own Discontents, and flatter themselves in not doing what they
should do, by presuming what they would do, were but their Condition o∣ther
than it is, not considering that every Estate hath its Weights as well as
Wings, and that the true Pleasure of Life is to be free from Perturbation, to
enjoy the present (without any anxious Depen∣dance upon the future) not to
amuse our selves either with Hopes or Fears, but to rest satisfied with
what we have, for <PB N="243" REF="282"/> he that is so wants nothing; the
great Blessings of Mankind are within us, and within our reach, but we
shut our Eyes, and like People in the dark, we fall foul upon every thing we
search for, with∣out finding it, an equality of Mind makes every Man his own
Supporter; whereas he that is born up by any thing else may fall; it is a
contented Mind that makes a Man Happy; there must be a Con∣stancy in all
Conditions, with such an indifferency for the Bounties of Fortune, that
either with them, or without them, we may live Contentedly.</P>
<P>It is the part of a great Mind to be temperate in Prosperity, and
resolute in Adversity. There are some that will close and grapple with
ill Fortune, and will come off victorious; but there are others again so
delicate, that they can∣not so much as bear a scandalous Report; which is
the same thing, as if one should quarrel for being justled in a Crowd, or
dashed as he walks in the Streets: A brave Man must expect to be
tossed, for he is to steer his Course in the Teeth of Fortune, and to
work against Wind and Weather.</P>
<P>The greatest Cause of Impatience grows not so much from the
Force of Calamity, as from the Reluctance of the <PB N="244" REF="283"/> Mind of
him that suffers it; this raises the Billows within, for tho' the Calami∣ty
may be rough and beyond our Power to extricate; yet when it meets with a Mind
as tumultuous as the Calamity, it raises a Storm, as when the Wind and Tyde
are contrary, which may endan∣ger the Vessel.</P>
<P>He that violently contends against Mis∣fortunes, is like one
bound with strong Bonds, his struggling gauls him more than his Bonds would
otherwise do, and a proud Spirit contributes more to his own Uneasiness,
than his Cross does: But Calmness of Mind breaks the force of the Calamity,
and the contented Man looks upon his worst Condition to be less than he
deserves, for so long as we live in this World, there is no Condi∣tion so
troublesome but it may be worse: If we be Poor and under a Cloud of
Ig∣nominy and Reproach, yet if we have our Health of Body and Composedness
of Mind, that's more than we deserve; nay, if we be under a Complication of
Misfortunes, so long as our Lives are spared, there's Hope, and we must
be Patient under all Conditions, submitting our selves intirely to the Will
of God; and that not only as an Act of Necessity and Duty, but as an Act of
Choice and <PB N="245" REF="284"/> Prudence, since all the Successes of
our Life are under the Government of Providence, and we may be assured,
that God will either in due time re∣move them, or support us under them.</P>
<P>Temporal Afflictions are Spiritual Phy∣sick, being administred
by the no less tender than skillful Hand of Providence; but we, like
foolish Patients, embitter our Condition, by chewing the Pills which we
should swallow; we mingle our Passions with our Crosses, and thro'
Impatience struggle with our Yoak, thereby making our Burthen more hea∣vy,
and our Afflictions the more grie∣vous: God's Love is fatherly for Ease, as
well as motherly for Tender∣ness; as a Father he will sometimes hum∣ble his
Children by Afflictions, sustain∣ing them with his Hand, not as a Mo∣ther,
still indulging them in Delights: He does always send his Staff with his
Rod, his Grace with his Affliction, to Instruct, Support and Comfort us
Where∣fore it's well said, That all the Troubles and Distresses that
befal us, tho' bitter Arrows, yet they come from the sweet Hand of God,
whose special Providence over us is such, that he afflicts us in Mercy:
God's Patronage and Protecti∣on is not like that of Men, who as
<HI>Sal∣vian</HI> <PB N="246" REF="285"/> says, They offend the Miserable by
defending them; like the thorny Bush, to which in the Storm when the poor
Sheep run for Shelter, they lose their Fleeces: But God is a Sun and a Shield
to those in Affliction; A Sun to en∣lighten them in the midst of
Darkness, and a Shield to defend them in the midst of Dangers; and by his
Spiritual Providence he then saves, when we seem to be past Succour; and
there∣fore we have reason, not only patient∣ly to submit, but cheerfully
and con∣tentedly to bear any Condition which he dispenses, and with an
implicite Faith to resign our Wills to his, be∣ing assured it is
infinitely more Wise and Just than ours.</P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> says, <HI>Optimi milites ad duris∣sima
mittuntur</HI>; the stoutest Soldiers are put upon the hottest Service;
and so the best Men upon the sharpest Suffe∣rings. It is a mark of a
General's E∣steem, when he puts an Officer upon a Post of Danger, who does
not say his General uses him ill, but does him Ho∣nour; and so should
we say that are commanded to encounter Difficulties: A Master gives his
hopeful Schollars the hardest Lessons; so God deals with the most
generous Spirits; and we are <PB N="247" REF="286"/> not to look upon the
cross Encounters of Fortune, as a Cruelty, but as a Con∣test. God tries and
hardens us, the fa∣miliarity of Misfortunes brings us the Contempt of them, and
that Part is strongest which is most exercised; the Seaman's Hand is
callous, the Soldier's Arm is strong, the Tree that is exposed to the Wind
takes the best Root. Those People that live in a perpetual Winter, in
extremity of Frost and Want, where a Cave, a Lock of Straw, or a few Leaves,
is all their Covering, and wild Beasts their Nourishment; all this by
Custom is not only made tollerable, but when once 'tis taken up by
Necessity, by little and little it becomes Pleasant to them. Why should
we then account that Condition of Life a Calamity, which is the Lot of many
Nations? Our Life is a Warfare; and what brave Man would not rather chuse to
be in a Tent than in a Shambles? Fortune seems to encounter a fearful Man,
there's no Honour in the Victory, where there's no Danger in the Way to it.</P>
<P>She tries <HI>Mutius</HI> by Fire, <HI>Rutilius</HI> by
Banishment, <HI>Socrates</HI> by Prison, <HI>Cato</HI> by Death; 'Tis only
in adverse Fortune and bad Times, that we find great Ex∣amples:
<HI>Mutius</HI> thought himself Hap∣pier <PB N="248" REF="287"/> with his Hand
in the Flame, than if it had been in the Bosom of his Mi∣stress: He was a
Man only of a Mili∣tary Courage, without the help either of Philosophy or
Letters; who when he found he had kill'd the Secretary instead of
<HI>Porsenna</HI> the Prince, burnt his Right Hand to Ashes for the
Mistake, and held his Arm in the Flame till it was taken away by his very
Enemies. And <HI>Porsenna</HI> did more easily Pardon <HI>Mutius</HI> for
his intent to kill him, than <HI>Mutius</HI> forgave himself for missing
of his Aim: He might have done a Luckier Thing but never a Braver.
<HI>Metellus</HI> suffer'd Exile reso∣lutely, <HI>Rutilius</HI> cheerfully;
<HI>Socrates</HI> dis∣puted in the Danger; and tho' he might have escaped,
refused it, to shew the World how easie a thing it was to sub∣due the
two great Terrours of Mankind, Death and Pain. The Action of <HI>Ruti∣lius</HI>
was commended by his very Ene∣mies, who upon a glorious and publick Principle
chose rather to lose his Coun∣try, than to return from Banishment; the
only Man who deny'd any thing to <HI>Sylla</HI> the Dictator, who recalled him;
but he not only refus'd to come, but retired farther off: <HI>Let them,</HI>
says he, <HI>who think Banishment a Misfortune, live Slaves at</HI> Rome,
<HI>under the imperious</HI> <PB N="249" REF="288"/> <HI>Cruelties of</HI>
Sylla; <HI>He that sets a Price upon the Heads of Senators, and after a Law
of his own Institution against Cut-Throats, becomes the greatest
himself.</HI> Is it not better for a Man to live abroad in Exile, than to be
massacred at home? 'Tis not the Torment, but the Cause we are to
consider; and in suffering for a good Cause, the more Pain the more
Renown; and we must look upon our Banishment and Hardships as Acts of
Providence, which suffers Particulars many Times to be wounded, for
Con∣servation of the whole: Besides, God chastizes some People under
appearance of Blessing them, turning their Prospe∣rity to their Ruin.</P>
<P>What was <HI>Regulus</HI> the worse because Fortune made choice
of him for an emi∣nent Instance of Patience; he was thrown into a Case of
Wood, stuck round on the inside with pointed Nails, so that which way
soever he turned his Body it rested upon his Wounds; his Eye-lids were cut
off to keep him waking, and yet <HI>Mecaenas</HI> was not happier upon his Bed
than <HI>Regulus</HI> upon his Torments. <HI>It hath pleased the Gods,</HI>
saith he, <HI>to single me out for an Experiment of the Force of humane
Nature.</HI> Indeed no Man knows his own Strength or Value but 
<PB N="250" REF="289"/> by being put to the Proof; the Pilot is try'd in a
Storm, the Soldier in a Battel: No Man can be happy that does not stand firm
against all Contingencies and Mis∣fortunes, for the more we struggle with
our Necessities we draw the Knot the harder, the more the Bird flutters in
the Snare, the surer he is caught; so that the best way is to submit
and lie still, under this double Consideration, that the Pro∣ceedings of
God are unquestionable, and his Decrees not to be revoked. That Man is only
Happy that is unmov'd with any external Misfortune, or at least so little
mov'd, that the keenest Arrow in the Quiver of Fortune is but as the prick of
a Needle to him rather than a Wound, and all her Weapons fall upon him as Hail
upon the Roof of a House, that crackles and skip off again without any Damage
to the Inhabitant.</P>
<P>Some Philosophers have search'd so far for Arguments of
Comfort against Pain, as to doubt whether there was any such thing as
Sense of Pain; and yet when any great Evil hath befaln them, they could
sigh, and groan, and cry out as loud as other Men. Others have held that
Afflictions are no real Evils but only in Opinion, and there∣fore a wise Man
ought not to be trou∣bled <PB N="251" REF="290"/> at them: But he must be a
very wise Man that can forbear being trou∣bled at things that are
troublesome. Others would delude this Trouble by a graver way of Reasoning,
<HI>viz.</HI> that these things are fatal, and therefore we ought not to be
troubled at them, it being in vain to be troubled at what we cannot help. But
<HI>Augustus</HI> made a sharp Reply to one that ministred this Comfort
to him, <HI>Hoc ipsum est,</HI> says he, <HI>quod me male habit.</HI>
This was so far from giving any Ease to his Mind, that it was the very
thing that troubled him. But the best Moral Argument of Patience is, the
Advantage of Patience it self: That is, to bear Evils as quietly as we can is
the way to make them lighter and easier; but to toss, and fling, and to be
restless, is good for no∣thing but to fret and inrage our Pain; 'tis like
Men in a Feaver, who infinite∣ly increase their Heat by their tumb∣ling and
tossing more than if they lay still; and thus we gall our Sores, and make
the Burthen that is upon us sit more uneasie, and like the Ship that is not
broken by the Rock but by its own vi∣olent Motion against it; and therefore
we must so manage our selves under <PB N="252" REF="291"/> Afflictions, as
not to make them more grievous than indeed they are.</P>
<P>If we give way to our Passions, we do but gratifie our selves
for the pre∣sent, in order to our future Disquiet; but if we resist and
conquer them, we lay the Foundation of perpetual Peace and Tranquility in our
Minds. The more we gratifie our Lusts, the more craving they will be;
<HI>Crescit indulgens sibi diras hydrops,</HI> every Lust has a kind of
hydropick Distemper, the more we drink the more we shall thirst, so
that by retrenching our inordinate Desires we do not rob our selves of any
Pleasures, but only the trouble of farther Dissatisfacti∣on.</P>
<P>He that enjoys the greatest Happiness in this World, does
still want one Hap∣piness more to secure him for the fu∣ture what he
possesses at present; and if the Enjoyments of this Life were
cer∣tain, yet they are unsatisfying; it is a hard thing that every thing in
this World can trouble us, but nothing can give us Satisfaction. I know not how
it is, but either we or the things of this World, or both, are so
fantastical, that we can neither be well with these things nor without
them: If we be hungry we are in Pain, and if we be full we are un∣easie; 
<PB N="253" REF="292"/> if we are poor we think our selves miserable, and if
we be rich we com∣monly really are so; if we are in a low Condition we fret
and murmur, if we chance to get up and are raised to Greatness we are many
times farther from Content than before; so that we pursue the Happiness
of this World just as little Children chase Birds, when we think we are
very near it, and have it almost in our Hands, it flies farther from us than
it was at first: Indeed the En∣joyments of this World are so far from
affording us Satisfaction, as the sweetest of them are most apt to
satiate and cloy us: All the Pleasures of this World are so contriv'd as
to yield us very little Happiness; if they go off soon they signify
nothing, and if they stay long we are sick of them: After a full Draught of
any sensual Pleasure, we presently loath it, and hate it as much after
the Enjoy∣ment as we searched it and longed for it in Expectation: But the
Delights of the other World, as they still give us full Satisfaction, so we
shall never be weary of them, every Repetition of them will be accompanied
with a new Pleasure and Contentment: In the Fe∣licities of Heaven two things
will be reconciled, which never met together in <PB N="254" REF="293"/> any
sensual Delight, long and full Enjoy∣ment, and yet a fresh and perpetual
Pleasure; it would embitter the Pleasures of Heaven to see an End of
them, tho' at never so great a Distance: But God hath so ordered things
that the vain Delights of this World should be tempo∣rary, but the
substantial Pleasures of the next World be as lasting as they are
excellent.</P>
<P>That Man is truly happy who is tempt∣ed to no anxious Fore-casts
for future E∣vents, knowing nothing can happen in Contradiction of that Supreme
Will in which he hath Sanctuary, which will certainly chuse for him with that
Ten∣derness that an indulgent Father would for his Child that casts its
self into his Arms: When our Will is thus inrolled with God's, all Calamities
are unstring∣ed, and even those things which seem most repugnant to our
sensitive Natures, are yet very agreeable to our Spirits. There is no Face
of Adversity so formi∣dable which set in this Light will not look
amiable; let us but make sure of Resignation, and Content will flow into us
without our farther Industry. <HI>Socra∣tes</HI> said rightly of
Contentment, opposing it to the Riches of Fortune, that 'tis the Wealth of
Nature, for it gives every thing <PB N="255" REF="294"/> that we have learnt to
want and really need; and Resignation in our present State bestows all
things that a Christian not only needs but can desire: 'Tis the
Usurpation of our Will over our Rea∣sons which breeds all the Confusions
and Tumults within our own Hearts, and there is no possibility of curbing
its In∣solence but by putting them into safe Custody, by oommitting it to
him who alone can order our unrully Wills, and nothing but Experience can
inform us of the Serenity and Calm of that Soul who has resigned his Will to
God.</P>
<P>It is certain in the Course of the World, there must be a
greater number of Crosses and Troubles than of external Comforts, nay there
is scarce any Comfort but, like <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Gourd, it hath a Worm at the
Root of it, which not only withers the Comfort it self, but creates greater
Trouble and Sorrow than the Comfort it self hath if intirely enjoy'd; so
that in all worldly things the Stock of Troubles is three times greater than
that of Com∣forts; so true is that of <HI>Job, A Man is born to troubles as
the Sparks fly upward</HI>; why therefore should a Man sink into
Discontent, because the World doth but follow its own natural State?</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="295"/>'Tis certain a prudent Man is like the Elixir,
it turns Iron into Gold, makes the most sowr Condition of Life not only
tolerable but useful and convenient; for a wise Man will mould and frame
his worst Condition into a Condition of Comfort by his Patience, and he that
can content himself with the good Tem∣per of his own Heart, has no Reason
to be discontented with his Condition, since if it be not good he can make
it such, the Mind being the chief Matter either in Content or Discontent:
We need no other Proof than that of <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Haman,</HI> the one a
great King the other a great Favourite to a mighty Mo∣narch full of Wealth and
Honour, yet a covetous Mind in the one, and a proud Mind in the other, made the
former seek for a little Spot of Ground, and the latter grew so highly
discontented for want of the Knee of a poor <HI>Jew,</HI> that it withered
all his Enjoyments. Patience and Resignation give us Possession of
our selves, we then remain Masters of our Passions, and tho' there be
Storms, and Tempests, and rolling Seas without us, yet all is calm within;
and tho' I want something that others have, yet I have somewhat that many
better than I want: If I want Wealth yet I have Health, if 
<PB N="257" REF="296"/> I want Health, yet I have Children, which others want.
Thus we should learn Con∣tentment, by considering others Wants and our
Enjoyments, and not learn Discom∣forts from others Enjoyments; tho' these
are only moral Considerations, yet they are of much Use and Moment, and
car∣ry'd the Heathens a great way in the Vir∣tue of Patience. But we are
furnish'd with a more excellent way, because no Affliction befalls us but
is reached out to us from the Hand of Divine Providence, from whom we have our
Being: The ge∣neral State of Mankind in this World is a State of Trouble and
Affliction, and is so incident to all Degrees and Conditions of Mankind, that
no Person of whatsoever Age or Sex but hath a Part in this com∣mon State of
Mankind. And we find Men in all Ages, that only by the Dire∣ction of natural
Light, have calmed their Disquiets, and reasoned themselves into
Contentment, under the greatest and most terrible Pressures; Men, who,
amidst the acutest Torments, have still preserv'd a Serenity of Mind,
and have frustrated Contempts and Reproaches by disregard∣ing them; and
surely we shall give a very ill Account of Christianity, if we cannot do
as much with it as they did without it.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="297"/>The greatest Cause of Discontent is,
that Men have no definite Measure of their Desires; 'tis not the Supply of
all their real Wants will serve their
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn, their Appetites are
precarious, and depend up∣on Contingencies; they hunger not be∣cause they are
empty, but because o∣thers are full. Many would like their own Portion well
enough, if they had not seen another whose Portion they lik'd better.
<HI>Ahab</HI> might well have satisfy'd himself with the Kingdom of
<HI>Israel,</HI> had not <HI>Na∣both</HI>'s Vineyard lay in his way:
<HI>Haman</HI> could find no Gust in all the Sensualities of the
<HI>Persian</HI> Court, because a poor de∣spicable <HI>Jew</HI> denies
his Obeisance; and thus every one of our Passions keeps us upon the Rack,
till they have obtain'd their Designs. If we will create imagina∣ry Wants to
our selves, why do we not create an imaginary Satisfaction to them. 'Twere
the merrier Frenzy of the two, to be like the mad <HI>Athenian,</HI> who
thought all the Ships that came into the Harbour his own, than to be still
tormenting our selves with unsatiable Desires; For we generally find
those that are farthest re∣mov'd from Want, are so from Content too; they
take no notice of the real sub∣stantial Blessings they enjoy, and go in
quest after some fugitive Satisfaction, <PB N="259" REF="298"/> which, like
a Shadow, flies still faster in proportion to their Pursuit. A strange
Folly, thus to court Vexations, and be miserable in Chimera. We chew the Cud
upon Gall and Wormwood, and embitter our own Lives meerly by these imaginary
Sufferings; nor do we only fright our selves with Images of past
Calamities, but we lay romantick Scenes for Distresses, and raise
Alarms to our selves: We do nicely and critically observe every little
adverse Accident of our Lives, and let a whole Current of Prosperity glide
by without our Notice; like little Children, our Fingers are never off the
sore Place, till we have pick'd every light Scratch into an Ulcer: Whereas,
if we cast up our Accounts justly, we shall find our Receits have
infinitely exceeded our Disburse∣ments, and that for the few Mites of
Obe∣dience we have pay'd to our Creator, we have receiv'd Talents of Mercies
from him; but instead of entertaining our selves with the pleasanter
Parts of God's Dis∣pensations to us, we always pore upon the harsher, and
look upon our Misfor∣tunes through all the magnifying Opticks our Fancies can
supply; and we are so full of our selves, that we can see nothing
beyond it. Every Man expects God should place him where he hath a Mind to be,
<PB N="260" REF="299"/> and tho' we are apt to tax it as a great In∣justice in
a Prince, when he indulges any thing to a private Favourite to the pub∣lick
Disadvantage, yet so unequal are we, that we murmur at God for not doing
that which we murmur at Men for doing. We must consider that other Men have
the same Appetites with us, and if we dislike an inferior State, why
should not we be∣lieve others do so too; and we must not think God
should be more concern'd to humour us than those Multitudes of o∣thers who
have the same Desires. Every Man would be above and superior, and if no
Man were below, no Man could be above: So in Wealth, most Men desire more,
but every Man does at least desire to keep what he has, how then shall
one Part of the World be supply'd, without the Diminution of the other,
unless there should be as miraculous a Multiplication of Treasure for
Men's Avarice, as there was of Loaves for their Hunger. It was a good Answer
which an Ambassador of an oppressed Province gave to <HI>Anthony, If, O
Emperor, thou wilt have double Taxes from us, thou must help us to double
Springs and Harvests.</HI> And sure God must be at the Trouble of a new
Creation, make a double World, if he should ob∣lige himself to satisfy
all the unreasonable <PB N="261" REF="300"/> Appetites of Men; the Truth is,
we have generally in us the worser Part of the Le∣vellers Principles, and
tho' we can very contentedly behold Multitudes below us, yet we are impatient
to see any above us; and thus we create Torments to our selves by our own
Repinings, which only sets us farther from our Aims.</P>
<P>It is observable of the first two Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI>
who were of God's immediate Ele∣ction, that he surpriz'd them with that
Dignity when they were about a mean Imployment, the one seeking his Father's
Asses, the other keeping his Father's Sheep; and surely he that sits
down with this Ac∣quiescence, is a happier Man than he that enjoys the
greatest Worldly Splendor, but infinitely more so than he who impatient∣ly
covets what he cannot attain, for such a Man puts himself upon a perpetual
Rack, keeps his Appetites up to the utmost Stretch, and yet hath nothing
wherewith to satisfy them; for either we are trou∣bled for the Want of
something we desire, or at the suffering something we would avoid. And
there is no Man who sober∣ly recollects the Events of his Life, but must
confess that he hath sometimes de∣sir'd Things that would have been to
his Mischief, if he had had them; and on the other side, when he has
obtain'd what he desir'd, <PB N="262" REF="301"/> it hath been to him a
Punishment, rather than a Satisfaction; whereas by our Acquiescence under
the Ills we suffer, the Bitterness is taken off from all our Af∣flictions,
there being nothing which so much purifieth us, if we do not frustrate
their Efficacy by our irregular Manage∣ment under them.</P>
<P>Afflictions wean us from the World; we read in the Story of the
Deluge, so long as the Earth was covered with Waters, the very Raven was
contented to take shelter in the Ark; but when all was fair and dry, even the
Dove finally forsook it; and it is much so with us, the worst of Men will
commonly in Distress have Re∣course to God, when the best of us are apt
to forget him in the Blandishments of Prosperity: We should not therefore
give our Hearts to any external Thing, but let all the Concerns of the World
hang loose about us, whereby we shall quit them in∣sensibly, whenever
they are call'd for. We must not look to be carried into Heaven upon Beds of
Ivory, nor from the Noise of Harps and Viols to be immediately wrap'd up into
the Choir of Angels: We may certainly often find that those Events which we
have entertain'd with Regret, have, in the Consequences, been very
be∣neficial to us, of which I am still a living <PB N="263" REF="302"/>
Testimony; for all the good Fortune and Promotion, which by their late
Majesties Grace and Favour I attain'd to, was oc∣casioned only by the
Dexterity I then shew'd in giving such good Account of Affairs abroad,
whilst I was then in Prison at <HI>Bruges.</HI> Nay, sometimes the
Inhuma∣nity of a Man's Relations are the Occasi∣on of his Advantage; thus the
barbarous Malice of <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Brethren was the first Step to his
Dominion over <HI>Egypt</HI>; and it is a common Observation in Families,
that the most discouraged Children usually prove better than the
Darlings; and there is nothing more ordinary than for that which one esteems
a great Calamity to be∣come the Foundation of our future Hap∣piness.</P>
<P>A low Condition is a terrible thing in Sound and Opinion, and that's
all: Some Men are banisht and stript of their Estates, others are poor in
Plenty, which is the basest sort of Beggary, for to spare of what a Man
hath, not only what he may need, but what he doth need, is not only to walk
with a Man's Horse in his Hand, but to carry the Saddle too; and of the two
it is a great deal better to die a Beg∣gar than to live a Beggar. We usually
condemn Villains to the Mines, and he that labours first to get Mony, and
then <PB N="264" REF="303"/> locks up his Mony from himself, condemns both
himself and it but again to the Mines, as if he envied both their very Being
a∣bove Ground. Poverty is not a thing to be wisht no more than War, but if it
be our Lott, we must bear our Misfortunes as becomes wise and honest Men;
we do not pray for War, but for Generosity and Cou∣rage in all the
Extremities of War, if it hap∣pens. Afflictions are but the Exercises of
Virtue, and an honest Man is out of his Element when he is idle: It is a
common Argument against the Justice of Provi∣dence, in the matter of Reward
and Pu∣nishment, the Misfortunes of good Men in this World, and the
Prosperity of the wicked; but alas, Misfortunes come by Divine Appointment,
and to those that are good Men even for that very Reason because they are
good: Prosperity shews a Man but one Part of humane Nature, no Body knows
what such a Man's good for, neither in Truth doth he understand himself
for want of Experiment. Tem∣poral Happiness is for weak and vulgar Minds, but
Calamity is the Touchstone of a brave Mind, that resolves to live and die
free and Master of it self; and Adver∣sity is best for us, for it is
God's Mercy to shew the World their Errors, and that the things they fear and
covet are neither <PB N="265" REF="304"/> good nor evil, being the common and
pro∣miscuous Lott both of good Men and bad; if they were good only the good
should enjoy them, and if bad only the wicked should suffer them: A
wise Man carries all his Treasure within himself; and what Fortune gives
she may take, but he leaves nothing at her Mercy: He stands firm and keeps
his Ground against all Misfortunes, with∣out so much as changing
Countenance, he is Proof against all Accidents: He is a Friend to Providence,
and will not mur∣mur at any thing that comes to pass by God's Appointment,
and never any Man was broken by Adversity that was not first betrayed by
Prosperity. The Truth is, we are generally mistaken in the Nature of Good
and Evil, and have not the true Measures of it; that is truly good which
makes a Man the better, and that truly evil which makes a Man the worse; if
Pro∣sperity makes me thankful, munificent and humble, then 'tis good for me,
and makes me better, but if it makes me proud 'tis evil for me: If Adversity
makes me cla∣morous and murmur 'tis ill for me, but if it makes me humble,
sober and patient then 'tis good; and let every Man impar∣tially take the
Measure of the very same Man in each Condition, he shall find ten to one
receive more Mischief by Prosperi∣ty <PB N="266" REF="305"/> than
Adversity. There is a strange Witchcraft in Prosperity which gets ground
upon our Mind and Virtue, espe∣cially upon our Humility, for Worldly Grandeur
secretly steals away that Vir∣tue, and impairs it sooner than any other;
Pride is the Devil, that usually haunts and waits upon Worldly Greatness:
How ma∣ny Men have we seen, that under the greatest Pressures and
Calamities of Po∣verty and Reproach have yet kept up their Reputation, but in
the warm Beams and Sun-shine of Prosperity have cast off their
Goodness, as the Traveller did his Cloak in the Fable, and became as great
Oppressors and debauch'd Livers, as if they had never heard of Heaven or
Hell. True Humility is a great Guard upon the Soul of a Man against these
Rocks and Hazards; an humble Man looks upon all his Prosperity and Plenty not
as his own, but as it is the Disposition of the great Master of the
Family of Heaven and Earth, Talents entrusted to him as a Steward to employ
for his Master's Ser∣vice and Honour, and not for his own Grandeur and
Pleasure; Our Vices are the Vermin that are commonly bred in us by the warm
Influences of Prosperity.</P>
<P>We do not compare the Good of others with our Good, nor their Evil
with our <PB N="267" REF="306"/> Evil, but with an envious Curiosity we
amass together all the desirable Circum∣stances of our Neighbour's
Condition, and with a prying Discontent we ransack all our Grievances, and
confront to them; this is but a thin Piece of Sophistry; and we change the
Scene, we compare our Neighbours and our selves in Point of Mortality, where
we make his Vices as much exceed ours, as our Calamities did his in the other
Instance. However this is the pleasanter kind of Deceit, for a Man hath
some Joy in thinking himself less wick∣ed than his Neighbour, but no
Comfort in thinking himself more miserable. Indeed if we could use our
Eyes aright, and see Things in their true Shapes, a Competen∣cy would be more
pleasing than Abun∣dance, and the envy'd Pomp of Princes, when ballanc'd with
the Cares and Ha∣zards annex'd, would rather make a wise Man fear than
desire Preferment; and if a Man well understood the Right, he would rather
chuse to wield a Flail than a Scepter; and indeed there is no greater
Unhappiness than the fond Admiration of other Mens Enjoyments, and Contempt
of our own: But if we would begin at the right end, and look with as much
Com∣passion on the Adversities of others, as we do with Envy at their
Prosperities, <PB N="268" REF="307"/> every Man would find Cause to sit
down contentedly with his own Burthen.</P>
<P><HI>David,</HI> the Man after God's own Heart, was no less
signal for his Afflictions than for his Piety; he was sometime an Exile
from his Country, and after being settled in his Throne, what a
Succession of Ca∣lamities had he in his own Family; the incestuous Rape
of his Daughter, the Re∣taliation of that by the Murder of <HI>Am∣mon,</HI> and
that seconded by the rebellious and barbarous Conspiracy of
<HI>Absalon</HI>; his Expulsion from <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; the base
Re∣vilings of <HI>Shimei</HI>; and lastly, the Loss of his darling Son in
the Act of his Sin. It is an ill-natur'd thing for any Man to think himself
more miserable, because another is happy, and yet it is this thing alone,
by which many Men have made themselves wretched, having created Wants to
them∣selves, from the envious Contemplation of other Mens Abundance. Whenever
God administers to us a bitter Cup, we may be sure the Ingredients are
medicinal, and such as our Infirmities require; he durst not trust our
intemperate Appetites with unmix'd Prosperities, the Lascivousness
whereof, tho' it may please our Palates, yet it may engender most fatal
Diseases. But alas, we do not understand our own Interest, because we
do not rightly under∣stand <PB N="269" REF="308"/> what we are our selves.
We con∣sider our selves meerly in our animal Be∣ing, our Bodies, and when
we are in∣vaded there, we think we are undone, tho' that Breach be made only to
retrieve that diviner Part within us, oppress'd with the Flesh about it,
for our Body is to our Soul but as a Garment to the Body, a de∣sent Case
and Cover; and certainly he must be a mad Man that would not rather have his
Cloaths cut than his Flesh, and we ought not to repine that our Souls are
cured at the Cost of our Bodies; and our impatient Resistances do only
frustrate the medicinal Part of our Afflictions, and our Murmur∣ings may ruin
our Souls but will never a∣vert any of our outward Calamities.</P>
<P>To make a right Estimate of this World, we should consider it
as a Stage, and our selves but as Actors, and to resolve that it is very
little material what Part we play, so we do it well; a Comedian may get as
much Applause by acting the Slave as the Conqueror, and he that acts the one
to Day, may to Morrow reverse the Part and personate the other; and
certainly he that hath well imprest upon his Mind the Vanity and Vexation of
the World, can∣not be much surprised at any thing that be∣falls him in it.
We take the magnifying Glasses of Discontent when we view our 
<PB N="270" REF="309"/> own Miseries and others Felicities, but look upon our
Enjoyments and their Suf∣ferings thro' the contracting Opticks of Ingratitude
and Incompassion. It is a very ill-natured thing for any Man to think
himself more miserable because another is happy, and yet this is the very
thing by which alone many Men have made them∣selves wretched, creating Wants
to them∣selves meerly from the envious Contem∣plation of other Mens
Abundance. <HI>Lu∣cifer</HI> was happy enough in his original State, yet could
not think himself so be∣cause he was not like the most High, and by
insolent Ambition forfeited his Bliss; and those do perfectly
transcribe his Copy, who cannot be satisfied with any infe∣rior Degree of
Prosperity but what their Impatiencies with other Mens Enjoyments of what
they cannot attain. God never articled with the Ambitious to give him Honours,
with the Covetous to fill his Bags, with the Voluptuous to feed his Luxury; if
therefore we expect to be sa∣tisfied let us modestly confine our Desires
within the Limits God hath set us, and then every Accession which he
superadds will appear a Bounty.</P>
<P>The best Expedient for Contentment is to confine our Thoughts to
the present. We often heap fantastick Loads upon our <PB N="271" REF="310"/>
selves by anxious Presages of things which perhaps will never happen, which
is one of the greatest Follies imaginable; for either the Evil will come, or
it will not; if it will, 'tis sure no such desirable Guest that we
should go on to meet it, we shall feel it time enough when it comes, we
need not anticipate our Sense of it; but if it will not come, what extream
Madness is it for a Man to torment himself with that which will never be,
to create to himself Engines of Tortures, and by such chimerical
Afflictions make himself as miserable as the most real ones could do?
therefore let us rest our selves upon that admirable Aphorism of our
Saviour's, <HI>sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</HI> A querilous
repining Humour is one of the most pernicious Habits in∣cident to Mankind,
but yet as deform∣ed People are most often in Love with themselves, so
this crooked Piece of our Temper is of all others the most indul∣gent to it
self; it will nourish it self with Chimeras, suborn a thousand
ima∣ginary Distresses, and is impatient of any Diversion, loves to
converse only with it self: Men cherish this Disease of their Mind,
and improve their Torment, roll and chew the bitter Pill in their Mouths, and
by devoting all Thoughts to the Sub∣ject <PB N="272" REF="311"/> of their Grief,
keep up an uninter∣rupted Sense of it, as if they had the same Tyranny for
themselves which <HI>Caligula</HI> had for others, and lov'd to feel
them∣selves die. This Word Calamity hath an ill Reputation in the World, the
very Name is more grievous than the thing it self; what need any Man complain
if he can turn that into a Happiness which o∣thers count a Misery? a wise
Man is ne∣ver surprised, in the midst of Plenty he prepares for Poverty,
as a prudent Prince does for War in the Depth of Peace; our Condition is good
enough if we make the best on't, and our Felicity is in our own Power. Every
Man should stand upon his Guard against Fortune, and take heed to
himself when she speaks him fairest. A brave Man looks upon himself
as a Citi∣zen, a Soldier of the World, in despite of Accidents and
Oppositions he maintains his Station, and is more ambitious of be∣ing reputed
Good than Happy. <HI>Mutius</HI> lost his Right Hand with more Honour than he
could have preserved it; he was a greater Conqueror without it than he could
have been with it, for with the very Stump of it he overcame two Kings,
<HI>Tar∣quin</HI> and <HI>Porsenna. Rutilia</HI> follow'd <HI>Cotta</HI> into
Banishment, she staid and she return'd with him too, and soon after
she lost him <PB N="273" REF="312"/> without so much as shedding a Tear;
a great Instance of her Courage in his Banishment, and of her Prudence in
his Death.</P>
<P>Many Men have longer Intermissi∣ons from Afflictions than
others, yet none are totally exempt from them; and that Man who hath lived to
the ordinary Ex∣tent of the Age of Man, will find his Crosses and
Sufferings have out-weighed the treasure of his Comforts in this Life: The
poor Man reckons it his Affliction that he wants Wealth, and the rich Man is
not without his Afflicti∣on, either in the Loss of it, or for fear of
losing it.</P>
<P>Men in Prosperity cannot suppose a Change in their Estates;
a healthful Man can hardly think of dying; the Reason is, that our present
Condition falls under our present Sense, and takes up our whole
Consideration, and things that are not yet are only present by
Contemplation, which does not so strongly affect the Mind, because it
hath not the like Strength of Impres∣sion upon the Mind as that which is
present and sensible; whereas an Ap∣prehension of a disadvantageous
Change of our Condition, admirably fills a Man with such a Temper of Spirit
as be∣comes <PB N="274" REF="313"/> his changed Condition: But a Man in
Prospetity, that never puts him∣self under the sad Thoughts of a Change
of his present Happiness, if such a Change befalls him he is at his Wits
end, he is surprised and over∣whelmed with it, being taken before he is
prepar'd: It is certain it is a very great Improvidence for a Man to be
learning those Virtues, when the pre∣sent Necessity calls for the Use
of them; it's like a Thief who is to learn to read when he is to pray his
Clergy.</P>
<P>Affliction doth not so much endan∣ger a good Man to lose his
Innocence as Wealth and Honour do; let any Man observe either in himself or
others, we are all equally the worse for Pro∣sperity, and it is a far
greater Diffi∣culty to manage a prosperous Fortune, than a low and afflicted
Condition; and therefore those are securest from Affliction that use
their Prosperity with Equality of Mind; because they keep a Check upon
their Corruptions, and so stand in less need of this Physick; for my
Part, I have quite forgot that ever I was prosperous, and my ill For∣tune
doth now the less trouble me; and I can well and truly say with
<HI>Seneca</HI>: 
<Q><PB N="275" REF="314"/> 
<L>Stet quicunque volet potens</L> 
<L>Auloe culmine lubrico:</L> 
<L>Me dulcis saturet quies,</L> 
<L>Obscuro positus loco,</L> 
<L>Leni perfruar otio.</L> 
<L>Illi mors gravis incubat,</L> 
<L>Qui notus nimis omnibus,</L> 
<L>Ignotus moritur sibi.</L> </Q> 
<Q> 
<L>Let him that will ascend the tott'ring Seat</L> 
<L>Of courtly Grandeur, and become as great</L> 
<L>As are his mounting Wishes; as for me</L> 
<L>Let sweet Repose and Rest my Portion be.</L> 
<L>Give me some mean obscure Recess, a Sphear</L> 
<L>Out of the Road of Business, or of Fear</L> 
<L>Of falling lower, where nothing may annoy</L> 
<L>Or hinder my Retirement to enjoy.</L> 
<L>Death is a meer Surprise, a very Snare</L> 
<L>To him that makes his Life its greatest Care,</L> 
<L>To be a publick Pageant known to all,</L> 
<L>But unacquainted with himself, doth fall.</L> </Q></P>
<P>When <HI>Job</HI> was scraping his Sores up∣on the Dunghill, he
said, <HI>Lord when I was in Prosperity I heard thee, but now in my
Affliction I see thee</HI>; which shews nothing gives a more intimate
Knowledge of God than to be sur∣rounded with Tribulation; the Soul in 
<PB N="276" REF="315"/> Prosperity grows proud, deaf and care∣less, so
that she must smart in the Sen∣ses to be made sensible. We are not
to be wrought upon but when afflicted and in Misery: <HI>Jonas</HI> in the
Whale's Belly, the Prodigal in the Pig-sty, the Sick in hi Feaver, the
Lascivious in his Sweat∣ing-tub, then they recollect themselves; but when
in Sports and Pastimes, say∣ling in a Sea of Plenty and Delights, all our
Senses are shut up, and no Pas∣sage open: Solid Virtue, like a Rose
amidst Thorns, seldom springs forth but in the Soil of Crosses,
Afflictions and Austerities. Those Men are truly virtuous who take as it
were with the same Relish the Gall of Misfortunes and the Honey of
Prosperity: No stormy Seasons hinder their Journey, and that which
distracts the soft and effeminate is to them Matter of Repose and Joy;
all Things that pass under the Name of Adversity are not so but to the
wicked, who make ill use of them in prising the Creature more than the
Cre∣ator. The Delay our blessed Saviour made in sending Succour to his
Disci∣ples, endanger'd by a Storm at Sea, suf∣ficiently hints unto us the
Pleasure God takes to see the Just row against the Stream, tug and
wrestle with all the <PB N="277" REF="316"/> Force they can against the
Storms and Afflictions of this World: And there∣fore it is well observed,
that God laid open <HI>Job</HI> to all the Assaults of Satan, but with this
Reserve, that he touch'd not his Life, and this not in regard that Death
would have eclipsed the Glo∣ry of that great Champion, but because he would
not be depriv'd of such a Com∣batant, to whose Conflict God with his
blessed Angels were intent with much Satisfaction, and so would not
lose the Pleasure of seeing that stout Skirmish fought to the last,
betwixt him and his Enemy; and something to this Purpose St. <HI>Gregory
Nyssen</HI> declares upon God's proceeding with the <HI>Israelites,</HI>
in com∣manding them to set up a brazen Ser∣pent, at the Sight of which
those who should be bitten by those venomous Crea∣tures might immediately
find their Cure; and asking the Reason why God did not take a shorter
Course by destroying all those Serpents, which had given an end to the
Plague; he at last satisfies him∣self with this Reason, that whilst
the <HI>Hebrews</HI> beheld the sovereign Medica∣ment in casting up their
Eyes to Heaven, they might thereby have Oc∣casion to consider from whence
they re∣ceived their Deliverance, which other∣wise <PB N="278" REF="317"/>
that gross ungrateful People would soon have forgot; so that to draw them
to pay what they ow'd to his Goodness, he was feign to lengthen out their
Af∣flictions.</P>
<P>Some Men are tired with whatever they have enjoyed in this World,
and ex∣pect no greater Satisfaction should they live a thousand Years;
every Pleasure appears but the same in different Forms, and they all agree
in leaving us afflicted with the same or greater Pain they found us in. We
walk here on Earth in an inchanted Castle of Shadows and Mock∣eries, our
whole Life is full of Vanity and Mistake; every Man's Fortune is but a
Repetition of <HI>Ixion</HI>'s, we court Clouds instead of Divinities, and
our most charming Fruitions consist in Emptiness.</P>
<P>Resignation and Tranquility are the golden Mean, and he that
steps over this Line on one side or the other, falls into the same Vanity
which he bemoans or ridicules in the rest of Mortals. I have perused many
Books, and convers'd with more Men, yet none of them can inform me what I am my
self; for in this Life we are faign to peep into the World thro' the close
Windows of our Senses, which are so darkned with the <PB N="279" REF="318"/>
Dust our Passions raise, besides the na∣tural Dulness of our
Compositions, that we are faign to use the Opticks of our Philosophy to
help our Sight: Yet after all we are still pur-blind, and so are like to be
during this mortal Life.</P>
<P>Many great Princes have exchanged the toilsome Glory and royal
Fatigues of Empire for the sweet Tranquility and Ease of a Country Farm,
and the whol∣some Exercises of Agriculture: Thus <HI>Dioclesian</HI>
quitted his Throne for the sake of a private Life, and those Hands which
had been accustomed to weild a Scepter, became at last volunta∣rily
familiar with the Spade, the Plough, and the Harrow. So Grand <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
Mo∣narch of the <HI>Persians,</HI> used to boast of the Gardens planted
and sowed with his own Hands; so may <HI>Louis le Grand</HI> well boast
that he hath exceeded all his Predecessors, nay even the Poets
them∣selves in their best Descriptions, in the Gardens and Water-works he
hath made at <HI>Marly, Versailles</HI> and <HI>Triannon.</HI> 'Tis certain
the <HI>Fabii,</HI> the <HI>Lentuli,</HI> the <HI>Ci∣ceros,</HI> and
<HI>Pisoes</HI> derived their Names from those kind of Vegetables which
they signify, and which their Fathers took delight in planting: Was not
<HI>Abraham</HI> a Herdsman, and <HI>Moses</HI> the Prophet fa∣miliar 
<PB N="280" REF="319"/> with God, and <HI>David</HI> the Prince of Poets, and
the most illustrious He∣roes amongst the <HI>Greeks</HI> and
<HI>Romans,</HI> and other Nations, were Keepers of Sheep, Goats and Oxen; and
the <HI>Ara∣bians</HI> are so at this Day, with the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> and
other Nations of the East.</P>
<P>We are all subject to various Changes and Vicissitudes in this
mortal State; our Lives are alternatively chequered with Good and Evil; Virtue
and Vice have their Turns in the Series of most Mens Actions, Prosperity
and Adversity in the Course of our Lives, and no Man can with Truth boast
the contrary, for we are all born to be Adventurers which happen in the
Pell-mell of humane Con∣versation.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express to the Life the Pleasure that a
Man feels in Solitude, when free and undisturbed he can for many Hours behold
the Motions of the Moon and Stars, which raise pious Thoughts and
Contemplations within his Breast; his ravisht Soul is ready to break
Prison with Joy, when 'tis inspir'd with certain Demonstrations of
Eter∣nity, after which a Man is nauseated with the narrow Principles of
ignorant Men, and hates to profane his Reason with the vain Discourse of
self-conceit∣ed <PB N="281" REF="320"/> Fools and Ideots, a Man is then cloy'd
with Life, and wishes to die amidst such charming Speculations.</P>
<P>The Cast of an Eye many times disco∣vers the secret Sentiments
of the Heart, so does a shrug of the Shoulders, a pout of the Lip, or any
other artificial Ge∣sture; they are all significant and expres∣sive of
what Affections and Thoughts we harbour within. There are some se∣cret
Characters in every Man's Face which speak the Nature of the Person; we
read the hidden Qualities of Men at the first Dash; some Men have the
very Signature of Virtue in their Faces, and hence are lasting Friendships
often con∣tracted.</P>
<P>I have spent the Spring and Summer of my Life in Vanity, Error,
and Igno∣rance, 'tis time I should provide for the Winter of my Age a stock
of solid Wis∣dom and Virtue.</P>
<P>It is as natural for the vulgar to inveigh against generous Souls,
as 'tis for Dogs to bark at the Moon, and yet that Planet is not moved at the
Snarles of inviduous Animals; so Souls truly no∣ble contemn the Censures of
the inferi∣or Part of Men.</P>
<P>God is pleas'd so to dispense his tem∣poral Blessings,
that he which hath least <PB N="282" REF="321"/> hath enough, not only to
oblige his Ac∣quiescence but his Thankfulness; tho' every Man hath not all
he wishes, yet he hath that which is more valuable than that he complains to
want. We must keep our Desires at home, and not suf∣fer them to ramble at
things without our Reach: God hath placed none of us in so barren a Soil, in
so forlorn a State, but there is something perhaps in it which may afford
us Comfort. But if in a sullen Humour we will not cultivate our own Field,
because we have per∣haps more mind to our Neighbour's, we may thank our
selves if we starve; the despising of what God hath given us is but a
cold Invitation to farther Bounty, this complaining Humour is a Sickness of
the Mind, a perpetual Craving of the Appetite without any Possibility of
Satisfaction, and is the same in the Heart which the <HI>Caninus
apetitus</HI> is in the Sto∣mach: The Generality of Mankind be∣ing commonly
made unhappy, not by any thing without them, but by those restless
Impatiences that are within them. And if <HI>Israel,</HI> the Lott of God's
own In∣heritance, that People whom he had singled out from all the Nations of
the World, could forfeit God's Favour by their Unthankfulness, sure none of
us <PB N="283" REF="322"/> can suppose we have any surer Entail to it. As
God loves a cheerful Giver, so he loves a cheerful Receiver; and we should
soon leave off murmuring if we did but seriously consider, that God
owes us nothing, and that whatever we receive is an Alms and not a Tribute.
<HI>Diogenes</HI> being asked what Wine drank the most pleasant,
answered, <HI>that which is drunk at another's Cost</HI>; and we can never
miss of this Circumstance to re∣commend our good Things to us, for be they
little or much they come <HI>gratis.</HI> It is the Character of an ill Nature
to write Injuries in Marble, and Bene∣fits in Dust; and however some may
acquit themselves of this Imputation as to Men, yet none can do so in
Relati∣on to God; and tho' he neither will nor can do Injury, yet we receive
every cross Accident with great Resentment, whilst his real Benefits are
not at all observed. 'Tis true, some Men's Impatiences have risen so
high, as to cast away Life be∣cause it was not cloathed with all the
Circumstances they wished; and tho' in an angry Fit many Men have with
<HI>Jonas</HI> wished to die, yet ten to one should Death then come, they
would be as willing to resist it as was the Man in the <HI>Apologue,</HI>
who wearied with his <PB N="284" REF="323"/> Burthen of Sticks flung it down and
call'd for Death, but when he came found no other Occasion for him but to be
helpt up again with his Bundle. 'Tis certain our Repinings proceed not from any
Defect of God's Bounty, but from the malignant Temper within us; and as it is
an easier thing to satisfie the Cravings of a hungry Appetite, than to cure
the nauseous Recoilings of a surfeited Sto∣mach, so certainly the
Discontents of the poor are more easier allay'd than those of the rich;
the Indigence of the one hath contracted his Desires into a narrow Compass,
but the other, who hath his Desires stretched and extend∣ed, is capable of
no Satisfaction: Alas! our Body, with all its Enjoyments, is but the lowest
Instance of God's Boun∣ty; 'tis but a decent Case for that ine∣stimable
Jewel within it; the Soul, like the Ark, is the thing for which this whole
Tabernacle was fram'd. The more intellectual Powers wherewith it is indued have
exercised the Curiosity and rais'd the Admiration of the great
Con∣templators of Nature in all Ages; and tho' the simplest Man knows he
has the Faculties of Imagination, Apprehensi∣on, Memory and Reflection, yet
the learnedst cannot affirm where they are <PB N="285" REF="324"/> seated,
or by what Means they operate. And considering whereof we are made, our
Preservation is no less a Work of Omnipotence than our first framing; nay
perhaps 'tis rather a greater, for we have now the Principles of Decay within
us, which tend to Dissolution; we want the Supplies of several things
without us, the Failing whereof returns us again to our Dust. The Air which
refreshes us may at another time starve us, the Meat that nourishes us
may choak us; nay, there is no Creature so inconsider∣able which does not
at some times serve us, and which may not at any time (if God permit) ruin
us; and if the di∣vine Providence did not draw out the better Properties of
these Creatures for our Use, and restrain the worser for our Security,
we should quickly return to our Dust. And if the ebbing and flowing of the
Sea put the Philosopher into such an Extasie, that he flung him∣self
into it, because he could not com∣prehend the Cause of it; in what
perpe∣tual Raptures of Admiration may we be, who have every Minute within us
and about us more and greater Won∣ders in our Favour, when we deserve the
Divine Power should rather exert it self in our Destruction.
<HI>Aristippus</HI> <PB N="286" REF="325"/> being bemoan'd for the Loss of a
Farm, reply'd with some sharpness upon his Condoler, <HI>You have but one
Field, and I have three left; why should I not rather grieve for you?</HI>
intimating, That a Man is not so much to Estimate what he hath lost, as
what he hath left; and we may easi∣ly be convinced, that even in our worse
Estate, our Enjoyments are more than our Sufferings, and God's Acts of Grace
do out-number those of his Severity to us.</P>
<P>There is no Man that can with Rea∣son affirm himself to be the
most un∣happy Man, there being innumerable Di∣stresses of others which
he knows not of: Many Sorrows may lie at the Heart of him that carries a
smiling Face, and many a Man has been an Object of Envy to those who look
only on the Out-side, who yet to those that know his private Griefs appears
more worthy of Compas∣sion. <HI>Solon</HI> seeing his Friend much
op∣pressed with Grief, carried him to the Top of a Tower that over-look'd
the City of <HI>Athens</HI>; and shewing him all the Buildings, said to
him, <HI>Consider how many Sorrows have, do, and shall in fu∣ture Ages
inhabit under all those Roofs, and do not vex thy self with those
Incon∣veniencies which are common to Morta∣lity,</HI> <PB N="287" REF="326"/>
<HI>as if they were only yours:</HI> It was the saying of <HI>Socrates, That
if there were a common Bank made of all Men's Troubles, most Men would
chuse rather to take those they brought, than to ven∣ture upon a new
Dividend, but think best to sit down with their own:</HI> He is an ill
Member of a Community, who in Publick Assessments will shuffle off
all Payments; and he is no better, who in this common Tax, which God hath laid
upon our Nature, is not content to bear his share. A sick Fortune produces
wholsome Counsels, and we reap this Fruit by adverse Fortune, that it
brings us at last to Wisdom; whereas prospe∣rous Fortune, like a strong
Gale upon a strong Current, carries a Man in a trice out of the sight of
Quiet; and if it be not well regulated, it is so far from easing us, that
it proves an Oppression to us; and a busie fortunate Man in the World,
calls many his Friends, that were at most but his Guests, and Men flock to
him, as they do a Fountain in hot Weather, both to exhaust and trouble
him.</P>

<HEAD>Of WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is much to be said in the Praise and Dispraise of
Women; as we are Rid∣dles to our selves, so that Sex is in a much higher

deviate to Vice, they are more hardned in it.</P>
<P>The great Actions in which they have born a part, speak the
Excellencies of their Nature: <HI>Judith</HI> in Sacred Writ is remembred with
great Glory; and <HI>Lu∣cretia</HI> in the <HI>Roman</HI> History, by her
Re∣solution, hath raised her self an eternal <PB N="289" REF="328"/>
Monument; neither must that Noble Vir∣gin <HI>Clelia</HI> be forgot, who
being given in Hostage to King <HI>Porsenna</HI> at the Siege of
<HI>Rome,</HI> she escaped her Guards by Night, and mounting a Horse
she found in the way, she swam over the <HI>Tyber</HI> in∣to
<HI>Rome</HI>; whereupon, and upon what <HI>Mutius</HI> had a little before
done and said, <HI>Porsenna</HI> (as if terrified by the stupen∣dious
Resolution of the <HI>Romans</HI>) con∣sented to a Peace.</P>
<P>And tho' some out of Wantonness of Wit, and Extravagancy of
Paradoxes, have called the Abilities of Women in question; yet those
Abilities best appear∣ing in Matters of Religion and Govern∣ment, we are in
neither of these with∣out Examples of able Women. The last Age gave us so
great a Queen for Go∣vernment, as scarce any former King did equal; and this
Age such a Queen-Dowager to our late King, that if <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI> were
again in being to write Lives by Parallels, he would not find for her Majesty
a Parallel amongst Women, since no Age hath seen her Equal for Beauty,
Piety, Virtue, Generosity, and other most Eminent Abilities and Princely
En∣dowments.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="329"/>The World indeed (which is no just Judge)
will scarce allow Women to be Wise; and because they are generally
commended enough for other Qualities, the World therefore delights to
lessen on one Side, what it is forced to allow on the other: For we
usually find in Women a Delicacy of Wit not common to Men, neither are Men's
Actions com∣monly attended with so much Graceful∣ness as Womens; and Ladies
are more skilful than Men in what they do, whether it be the Advantage of
pleasing be more Natural to them, or that finding their great Strength to lie
there, they make it more their Study from their Child∣hood: And where Women
have sub∣mitted themselves to as good Education as Men, their Sex hath not
prejudiced them from being great Examples to o∣thers; and this Sex hath always
been esteem'd and found by the <HI>English</HI> wor∣thy of Empire, and when
it hath been enthron'd, it hath bestow'd great Feli∣city upon the Nation,
neither hath it given Place to the other Sex for illustri∣ous Qualities, and
the highest Virtues.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Venetian</HI> Story we find certain Matrons of that City
were sent in Qua∣lity as Ambassadresses to an Emperor, with whom that
State had occasion to <PB N="291" REF="330"/> treat; And in the
<HI>Eastern</HI> Parts of the World, it's usual for Women to be
Am∣bassadresses; and in Affairs of Religion, Women have ever had a
great Hand, tho' sometimes on the Left as well as the Right; sometimes
their abundant Wealth, sometimes their Personal Affe∣ctions to Church-men,
and sometimes their indiscreet Zeal; many times the Voices of great Men,
both in Civil and Ecclesiastical Assemblies, have been in the Power and
Disposition of Women: And hence it is, that in the old Epistles of some
Popes, we find as many Letters of those Popes, to the Emperors Wives,
Mothers, and Sisters, as to the Emperors themselves.</P>
<P>It would be a kind of unpardonable Envy to conceal some other
Excellen∣cies of Women, and the Advantages they have of us in many Respects:
Some <HI>He∣brew</HI> Doctors, from the different Names of <HI>Adam</HI> and
<HI>Eve,</HI> draw Arguments to prove the Dignity and Perfection of the Female
Sex, in that <HI>Adam</HI> signifies Earth, but <HI>Eve</HI> expresses
Life. And they affirm, That every Name which God impos'd on any thing,
describes its Nature and Quality, as a Picture represents the Ori∣ginal;
and therefore by how much Life is to be esteemed more than Earth, by 
<PB N="292" REF="331"/> so much more excellent, in the Opinion of these
<HI>Rabins,</HI> is Woman, than Man: They endeavour to strengthen this
Opi∣nion, by shewing, that God having made Man, and then survey'd the
System of his Works, found nothing more excel∣lently and divinely fram'd than
Woman, and therefore in her rested and commen∣ced the Sabbath, as if he could
not make the Idea of another Creature more per∣fect than her, or as if he did
not esteem the Universe it self compleat, without the last and most
accomplish'd of his Works: And as the End is always first in the Intention,
and last in Execution, Woman therefore being the last Work of the Creation,
it is thereby evident that she was the chief Design and Aim God Almighty
had in building this im∣mense Fabrick, which he furnish'd and adorn'd with
infinite Riches and De∣lights, and then introduced <HI>Eve</HI> as into her
Native proper Place, there to reign as absolute Queen over all his Works: And
besides, the particular Place of her Creation does much exalt her, in that
she was formed in Paradice amongst the Angels, whereas <HI>Adam</HI> was
made in the common Waste amongst the Brutes: But the most prevailing
Argument is from the stupendious Beauty of that Sex, <PB N="293" REF="332"/>
which like finer sorts of Clouds in Sum∣mer, seem to ingross the Splendor
of the Sun, and to reflect his Beams on the World? How matchless is indeed a
Wo∣man's Form? What dazzling Majesty en∣virons her from Hand to Foot? Can you
gaze on her lovely Countenance without Astonishment, or fix your Eyes upon
her without an Extasie? Indeed, so admirable is the Figure, Voice, and Mein
of a beautiful Woman, that he is wilfully Blind, who does not see, what∣ever
Beauties the whole World is capa∣ble of, are concentred in that Sex. Yet after
all this, they have their dark Side too, like the rest of mixed Beings: They
are the Frontier Passes of the World a∣bove and of that below, the Gates of
Life and Death, the very Avenues to Heaven or Hell, according as they are
used; like Fire they will warm and re∣fresh a Man, if he keeps at a due
di∣stance; but if he approach too near, they scorch and blister him; or
like the other Element of Water, they are very good and serviceable, whilst
kept within their Bounds, but let them once break down the Banks of Modesty,
they'll threaten all with Ruin: In a word, It is neither safe to Vex them in
the least, or Humour them too much; the excess <PB N="294" REF="333"/> of
Fondness, as well as the defect of natural Love, may equally undo us; Prudent
Generosity is the only Method of making our selves happy in the En∣joyment
of them. The frequent and familiar Converse Women are allow'd with Men,
within the Bounds of Mo∣desty, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
is a great Advantage to them; and cer∣tainly the <HI>Italians</HI> and
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> in their so great strictness to this Sex, do much
Err; for besides the Injustice they act, in depriving them of that Liberty
which God and Nature allows them, it is im∣possible they should ever
become more Virtuous by being confin'd to the Melan∣cholly of a Cloister,
which must neces∣sarily indulge and minister loose Thoughts, when if
they converst in the World, they might improve themselves by Know∣ledge,
and the Diversions they would receive from the Company of others, which would
keep them from thinking of Ill so frequently.</P>
<P>The present <HI>Jews</HI> of this Age, and <HI>Turks,</HI> have an
odd Opinion of Women, believing they are of an inferior Crea∣tion to Man, and
therefore they exclude them, the first from their Synagogues, the other from
their Mosques, which is not only Partial but Profane; for the 
<PB N="295" REF="334"/> Image of the Creator shines as clearly, if not more,
in the one, as in the other; and I believe there are as many Female Angels in
Heaven as Males, though in Heaven there be many Mansions; to which may be
added, that there went better and more refined Atoms to the Creation of Woman
than there did of Man.</P>
<P>'Tis true, it was a weak Part in <HI>Eve</HI> to yield to the
Seducements of the Ser∣pent, but it was a weaker Thing in <HI>Adam</HI> to be
tempted by <HI>Eve</HI> who was the weaker Vessel. The Ancient
Philoso∣phers had a better Opinion of that Sex, they ascribed all Sciences
to the Muses, all Sweetness and Morality to the Graces, and Prophetick
Inspirations to the Si∣bylls; and we find in all Authors high Examples of the
Virtues of Women; And if they did but consider what an Ascendant they have
upon Men, and that tho' they were the Source of all our Miseries, yet we
still adore them, they would be something more complacent; for it is
certainly a sign of good Nature to be amorous of Women; and he is look'd upon
as a Monster, or degene∣rate Person, who feels no Warmths of Passions
for that lovely Sex: Women were sent into the World on purpose, 
<PB N="296" REF="335"/> as many think, to blow up those gentle Flames, which
sublimate our grosser Mould, and make us more refined: The Love of Women
is riveted in our Na∣ture, and our Blood must first grow Cold before this
Flame can be extinguished; nay many times it is more fervent, tho' of a
short Duration, in our latest Hours than in our Prime: As when the Oil
which feeds a Lamp is almost spent, the startled Flame begins to rouze it
self and burn afresh, as if it would feign subsist a little longer,
and then it crackles and flashes with greater Noise and Lustre than
before, but presently expires; so does this Amorous Fire, when we are
nearest our Dissolution, begin to trou∣ble us most, and makes our Souls
blaze with Fevers of Desire and Grief, know∣ing its Period is near. I know
some Women are as Shadows, the more you follow them the faster they fly
from you; and they are of that odd Humour, that to feed their Pride, they will
starve those Natural Passions which are owing from them to Men: I
confess, Coyness be∣comes some Beauties, if handsomely acted, and a
Frown from some Faces penetrates more, than the soft Glances of a mincing
Smile; but if this Coy∣ness or those Frowns savour of Pride, 
<PB N="297" REF="336"/> they are odious, if not ridiculous; for it is a true
Rule, where this kind of Pride inhabits, Honour sits not long Porter at the
Gate.</P>
<P>There are indeed some Beauties so strong, that no Batteries
can do any good upon them; there are others that are tenable a good while, but
will incline to Parley at last, and that Fort which begins to Parley is half
won: For my own Part, I think of Women what <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> of
<HI>Macedon</HI> thought of Cities, There is none so Inexpugnable but an
Ass laden with Gold may enter into it; and as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> say,
Presents may rend Rocks; Pearls and golden Bullets may do much upon the
most impregnable Beauty that is. And yet I knew an <HI>English</HI> Lord
that sent a little Dog to a Lady he esteem'd much, with a rich Collar of
Diamonds; she took the Dog, but re∣turn'd the Collar; but what effect it
wrought after I cannot say. 'Tis a powerful Sex; they were too strong for
the first, the strongest, and the wisest Man that ever was; and yet
for all their Strength, in Point of Value, the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> says, (I
will not say truly) That a Man of Straw is worth a Woman of Gold. In fine,
the best Advice I can give in this Case, is, When Women are 
<PB N="298" REF="337"/> perverse, retire handsomely, there be∣ing as much
Honour to be got in a hand∣some Retreat, as in a hot Pursuit; and by this
Retreat you will get a greater Victory than you think of, for you will Overcome
your self, which is the grea∣test Conquest that can be made.</P>
<P>Those do great wrong to Ladies that esteem them unable to govern
a State, since History tells us, That the Female Sex is not only worthy to
bear the Scepter, but that Ladies have pre∣served and enlarged the Kingdoms
of <HI>Spain, England, Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> who never
flourished so much as under the two <HI>Elizabeths, Margaret</HI> and
<HI>Christina:</HI> Never King of <HI>England</HI> was better obey'd than
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; the Commanders freely acknowledg'd their Victories
proceeded as much from the happy Genius of their Queen as from their own
Valour: And <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> Wife to <HI>Philip</HI> IV.
would have re-established the Affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> if the
Impertinency of a Favourite had not held her at a distance from the Councils
of the King her Husband: They are not all sufficiently qualified to Rule,
neither are Men. There are but few Women indeed, because the Malice or Envy
of Men keeps them off from <PB N="299" REF="338"/> shewing their Abilities,
and making their Prudence and Generosity admired; and if there were as many
Women as Princes upon the Throne, we should often find Female
Accomplishments superior to ours, there being many Ladies worthy to Govern,
and would be many more, if they were instructed and brought up to great
Affairs from their younger Years.</P>

<HEAD>On the Knowledge of God, and a∣gainst Atheism.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ITH whatsoever other Knowledge a Man may be endued, he is but
ignorant who does not know God, the Duty he owes Him, and the way to praise
Him, who can make him happy or miserable for ever. Tho' a Man could know all
that Nature or Art requires, could attain to a Maste∣ry in all Languages, and
sound the Depths of all Arts and Sciences, could discover the Interests
of all States, the Intrigues of all Courts, the Reasons of all civil Laws and
Constitutions, and give an Account of the History of all Ages, and yet
should want the Know∣ledge of God: All this would be but an impertinent
Vanity, and a glittering kind of Ignorance. Such a Man would be undone with all
his Knowledge, and be like the Philosopher, who gazing upon the Stars fell
into the Ditch. For true <PB N="301" REF="340"/> Wisdom regards our own
Interest, and he is not a wise Man who does not take Care of his own
Concerns.</P>
<P>Nothing can more effectually under∣mine the Foundation of our
Happiness, than to banish the Belief of a God out of the World; for if
there were no God, Man would be in a worse Condition than Beasts, who are
only sensible of pre∣sent Pain, and when it is upon them they bear it as
they can, not being ap∣prehensive of Evils at a Distance, nor tormented
with the Prospect of what may befal them hereafter; but Man is liable to
these Evils and many others, which are so much the greater, because they
are aggravated by the sharp Re∣flections of our own Thoughts, and if there be
no God we are wholly with∣out Comfort, and without any other Re∣medy than what
Time will give; But if we believe there is a God that takes Care of us, this
must be a mighty Com∣fort to us, both under our present Af∣fliction, and
the Apprehension of Evils at a Distance, for in that Case we are
se∣cure, that either God by his Providence will prevent the Evils we fear, or
will support us under them when they come, or will make them the Occasion
of a greater good to us, by turning them <PB N="302" REF="341"/> either to our
Advantage in this World, or the Encrease of our Happiness in the next.</P>
<P>Atheism hath struck on a sudden into such a Reputation, that
it scorns any lon∣ger to sculk, but shews it self more Pub∣lickly than
most Men dare do the con∣trary; nothing passes for Wit that hath not its
Stamp, and with it there is no Metal of so base Alloy but will go cur∣rant;
every dull Man that can but stout∣ly disdain his Maker, hath by it
secured his Title to Ingenuity: And yet it is im∣possible for any Man who
sees only the smallest part of the Universe, to doubt of a Free and
Supream Being, untill by the Sense of his Wickedness it becomes his
Interest there should be none; for certainly there never was any Man who
said there was no God, but he wished it first.</P>
<P>'Twas good Counsel given to the <HI>A∣thenians,</HI> to be very
careful <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon</HI> was dead, before they exprest
their Joy at his Death, least they might find him alive to revenge their
hasty Tri∣umph; and so let the Atheists be sure there is no God, before
they presume thus to defie him, least they find him at last as∣sert
his Being in their Destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="342"/>The great Mystery of Atheism, is, that Men
are wedded to their Lusts, and are resolved upon a wicked Course, and
so it becomes their Interest to wish there were no God, and to believe
so if they can; so that nothing but the Power of vicious Inclinations
sways Mens Minds towards Atheism, and when Mens Judgments are once
byass'd, they do not believe according to the Evidence of Things, but
according to their Humour and Interest; for when Men live as if there were no
God, it becomes expe∣dient for them that there should be none, and then they
endeavour to persuade themselves so, and are glad to find Ar∣guments to
fortifie themselves in that Persuasion.</P>
<P>That there have been many false Gods devised, is rather an
Argument that there is a true One, than that there is none: There would be no
Counterfeits but for the sake of something that's real; For tho' all
Pretenders seem to be what they really are not, yet they pretend to be
something that really is: There would be no Brass Money if there were not
good and lawful Money: <HI>Bristol</HI> Stones would not pretend to be
Diamonds, if there never had been any Diamonds: Those two great Counterfeits,
<HI>Lambert</HI> <PB N="304" REF="343"/> <HI>Simuel</HI> and <HI>Perkin
Warbeck,</HI> had never been set up in <HI>Henry</HI> VII's Time, if there
had not once been a real <HI>Plantagenet</HI> and Duke of <HI>York:</HI> So the
Idols of the Heathens, tho' they were set up in Af∣front to the true God, yet
they rather prove there is One, than the contrary.</P>
<P>It is evident to common Sense, that Man is not sufficient of
himself to his own Happiness; he is liable to many Miseries, which he can
neither prevent nor redress: He is full of Wants which he cannot supply,
and of Infirmities which he cannot remove, and obnoxious to Dangers against
which he cannot pro∣vide: Consider a Man without God's Protection, and he is
sure of nothing he enjoys, and uncertain of every thing he hopes for. He
Grieves for what he can∣not help, Desires what he cannot obtain; Courts
Happiness, which flies from him the farther he pursues it. His Hopes and
Expectations are bigger than his En∣joyments, his Fears and Jealousies more
troublesome than the Evils themselves: So that the Atheist deprives
himself of all Comfort that the Apprehensions of a God can give a Man, and
yet is liable to all the Trouble and Disgust of those
Apprehensions.</P>

<HEAD>Of RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>OST People take up their Religion for a Fashion, and receive it
according to the Country where they are born, and are therefore of that
Religion; and the Reason why we are <HI>Christians</HI> rather than
<HI>Jews, Turks,</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> is because Christian Religion
had the Fortune to come first in our Way, and bespeak us at our Entrance
into the World. The Christian Religion may make <HI>Archymedes</HI>'s
Challenge, Give it but where it may set its Foot, allow but a sober
Advertence to its Proposals, and it will move the whole World: It comes with
most convincing Arguments, but these must first obtain Attention,
before they can force Assent. They will most infallibly weigh down the
Scales, if you try and examine their weight.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="345"/>But it's to be fear'd we are so stupid and
unconcern'd, that all the persuasive Rhetorick of the Gospel will make no
Impression upon us, all the Avenues of our Reason are so blocked up,
that they will find no way of approaching. We are like the <HI>Indian</HI>
Serpents <HI>Philostratus</HI> mentions, Proof against all Charms, but
such as with their glittering Splendor assault our Eyes. Nothing moves us
but what courts our Senses, and what is not gross enough to be seen, we
think too nice to be consider'd. The Form and Name of Christianity Men find
rea∣dy to their Hands, and it costs them no Labour to call themselves
Christians, as they do <HI>French</HI> or <HI>English,</HI> only be∣cause
they were born within such a Territory, and have taken up their Re∣ligion as
part of their Fate, the Temper of their Climate, the Entail of their
Ancestors, the Profession of it descends to them by way of Inheritance,
and like young careless Heirs, they are never at the Charge to Survey it, to
inform them∣selves of the Revenues of it, what Bur∣then it lies under, or
what Advantages it promises.</P>
<P>It is to be fear'd that of those vast Mul∣titudes that have
entred the Baptismal <PB N="307" REF="346"/> Vows, most of them weigh it as
little when they should perform it, as they did when they made it, and have
no other Notion of Baptism, but as a Cu∣stom of the Place, or a Time of
Feast∣ing, and consider no farther Significan∣cy in those Spiritual
Bonds, than they did in their Swadling Cloaths; and can give no better account
why they took on them Christ's Livery, than why they wear such Garments as
the common Fashion of the Country prescribes them: But where Men are so
Ignorant, it must necessarily infer, their Parent's Negli∣gence either in
not infusing, or their own stubborn Perverseness in resisting
Instruction. But it is more probable to conclude the former, since if
Children were early instructed, Knowledge would insensibly insinuate it
self before their Years had arm'd them with Obstinacy enough to make Head
against it. And when by the Parent's Remissness the proper Seed-time is
lost, the Soil grows stiff and untractable, the Labour of Learning averts
their Childhood, and the Shame of it their Manhood, and they grow old in their
Ignorance, and are ready to leave the World before they come to know any thing
of that <PB N="308" REF="347"/> which is to succeed it. This is a com∣mon and
despicable Case, which loudly accuses their Parents, who thus wretch∣edly
hazard their Children's greatest Concernment. And as it was a Fault in their
Parents to let their Children want those necessary Infusions, 'tis
sure∣ly so in themselves, to let their riper Years continue in that
Ignorance, ha∣ving scarce ever thought of their Reli∣gion, since they cou'd
their Lesson to avoid Correction. And then 'tis no wonder if they pass in
the same Forget∣fulness with other the Occurrences of that slippery Age:
But if to some their Memory hath been so faithful as to re∣tain those
early Impressions which were made in it; yet alas, it avails little; for a
Man's Remembrance of his Creed may tell him there is a God, and that he is
Almighty; but if his Reason be so much asleep as not to infer from thence
the Necessity of Reverencing and Obey∣ing him, he may repeat the Creed
eve∣ry Day, and yet be an Atheist.</P>
<P>The Difficulty of removing what is imprinted in us by Education is
very hard; that which Men take in by Edu∣cation being next to that which is
Na∣tural; and most Men owe the Principles <PB N="309" REF="348"/> of their
Religion to their Education, or Climate wherein they were Born, being bred up
either to confirm those Principles their Parents instilled into them, or by
a general Consent proceed in the Religion of their Country, there being a
Geography of Religions as well as Lands, and every Climate is not on∣ly
distinguish'd by their Laws and Li∣mits, but circumscribed by their
Do∣ctrines, not considering whether true or false, but only according to
their Interest: And if we consider the Lives of most Men of all
Conditions, we shall find the Honours and Pleasures of the World, which we
renounced in Bap∣tism, are the very Gods which share the World amongst
us.</P>
<P>Tho' we have seen Overturnings of States and Kingdoms, and great
Chan∣ges, yet the true Church, that adores that God that was ever ador'd,
subsists without Interruption, and that Religion which hath always been
opposed, still subsists. It hath many a Time been al∣most
extinguished, yet God hath al∣ways been pleas'd to raise and recover it by
Wonders of his Goodness and Power; and what is also very obser∣vable is,
That it hath never submitted <PB N="310" REF="349"/> to yield or bow to the
Will of Ty∣rants, Let us but take a serious View of the Apostles chosen
by <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> Those Persons that were Ignorant and
Unlearned, of a suddain were found sufficiently able to put to Silence the
wisest Philosophers, and Courageous enough to oppose the greatest
Kings or Tyrants that resisted the Christian Re∣ligion which they Taught
and Preach'd. If we see a Miracle, say some Men, we would be Converted;
they think there is no more in Conversion, but to believe there is a God,
when the De∣vil does that and trembles; but true Conversion consists in
Humbling our selves before the Saviour of the World, whom we have so often
Povoked, and who might justly every Minute destroy us; to confess, we can
do nothing without him, and that we have deser∣ved nothing but his
Displeasure. It consists in acknowledging that there is a great Enmity
betwixt God and us, and without a Mediator we could have had no Access nor
Favour.</P>
<P>I know very well, that good Men may and often do blemish the
Repu∣tation of their Piety, by over-acting some Things in Religion, by an
un∣grateful <PB N="311" REF="350"/> Austerity and Sourness, which Religion
does not require; a substan∣tial, discreet and unaffected Piety makes no
great Noise nor Shew, but expresses it self in a constant serious
Devotion, accompanied with good Works and Kindness, which makes a Man
pleasing both to God and his Neighbour: Reli∣gion makes Men obedient to
Govern∣ment, and conformable to Laws; it makes Men Peaceable to each other, it
heals the Natures of Men, and sweetens their Spirits; it corrects their
Passions, and mortifies all those Lusts, which are the Causes of
Enmity and Divisions: If Men would live as Religion requires they should
do, the World would be a quiet Habitation: And the true Rea∣son, why the
Societies of Men are so full of Tumult and Disorder, is, Be∣cause there
is so little true Religion a∣mongst them; so that if it were not for
some small Remainders of Piety and Virtue, which are yet scatter'd
amongst Mankind, humane Society would in a short Time disband and run into
Con∣fusion, the Earth would grow wild and become a great Forest, and Men
would turn Beasts of Prey one towards the other: So that Religion hath so
great <PB N="312" REF="351"/> an Influence upon the Felicity of Man, that it
ought to be upheld out of Re∣gard to their Temporal Peace and Pro∣sperity, as
well as to their Eternal. Religion does qualify all Sorts of Men, and makes
them in Publick Affairs the more Serviceable, Governors apter to Rule with
Conscience, and Inferiors for Conscience Sake the willinger to Obey. And it
is a great Truth, That all Du∣ties are by so much the better perform'd by how
much the Men are more Reli∣gious from whose Abilities the same proceed; and
if Magistrates, who are employ'd about the Publick Admini∣stration of
Justice, follow it only as a Trade for Gain's-Sake, the Formality of
Justice will then only serve to smo∣ther Right, and that which was
neces∣sarily ordain'd for the common Good, will be the Cause of common
Mise∣ry.</P>
<P>Religion has a Superiority above all other Things, and is as
necessary to our living Happy in this World, as it is to our being Saved in
the next; with∣out it a Man is an abandon'd Creature, one of the worst
Beasts Nature hath produced, and fit only for the Society of Wolves and
Bears, and therefore in <PB N="313" REF="352"/> all Ages it hath been the
Foundation of Government. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nd
therefore as no∣thing is better for being Soure, it would be hard Religion
should be so, which is the best of Things, and is so Cheerful, and so
far from being al∣ways at odds with good Humour, that it is inseparably
united to it, and no∣thing of Unpleasantness belongs to it. A Virtue
stuck with Bristles is too rough, it must be adorned with some Flowers,
or else it will be unwillingly entertained; so that even where it may be
fit to Strike, do it gently; and where one takes Care to do it, he would wound
others more, and hurt himself less by soft Strokes, than by being harsh
and violent.</P>
<P>Most People keep to that Religion which is grown up with them,
think∣ing that the best; and the Reason of staying in it upon that
Ground, is somewhat stronger for Women, than will be allow'd for Men, who
are bound to search the Truth.</P>
<P>Tho' Kings be Gods on Earth, yet they are Subjects of Heaven, and
ac∣countable to God: Religion in a King strengthens his Authority, it
procures Veneration, and gains a Reputation; <PB N="314" REF="353"/> and in all
Publick Affairs, so much Reputation is really so much Power; and even in
Men of low Degree, Re∣ligion will command some Reverence and Respect: But
in Persons of emi∣nent Place and Dignity, it casts a Lu∣stre upon them,
and by a strong Re∣flection doubles the Beams of Majesty; as the
clearness of the Eye disposes for a quicker Sight, so the clearness
of the Mind disposes us to more perfect Acts of Religion. Few Things are
well learnt but by easy Precepts, those well infused will make them
Natural, and we are never sure of retaining what is valuable, till by
continual Ha∣bit we have made it a Piece of us.</P>
<P>We must not think the Rewards of Heaven, like ripe Fruit upon a
full laden Bough, should stoop down to us, to be taken by every idle and
wanton Hand: That Heaven should be prosti∣tuted to the lazy Desires and
ordinary Endeavours of Slothful Men. God will not so much disparage eternal
Life and Happiness, as to bestow it upon those who have so low an
Opinion of it, as not to think it worth taking Pains for. We must use our
best En∣deavours, doing what we can, and <PB N="315" REF="354"/> then we may
expect God's gracious Assistance: But when Men expect Re∣ligion should
cost them no Pains, and that Happiness should drop into their Laps
without any Labour on their Part, and that God should snatch them up into
Heaven when they Die, as he did the good Thief, they will at last find
themselves much mistaken in their Measures: 'Tis troublesome at
first, I confess, for a Man to begin a new Life; but when he begins to
habi∣tuate himself to a Religious and Vir∣tuous Life, the Trouble will soon
go off, and unspeakable Pleasure succeed in its Place. It was an
excellent Rule, which <HI>Pythagoras</HI> gave to his Schol∣lars, <HI>Optimum
vitae genus eligito nam consuetudo faciet jucundissimum: Re∣solve
always to do what is most rea∣sonable, and Custom will soon make it
Easie.</HI> And those, who upon Pretence of the Difficulties of Religion,
aban∣don themselves to a wicked Course of Life, may easily be convinced,
(tho' perhaps when 'tis too late) that they took more Pains to make
themselves Miserable, than would have been to bring them to
Happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="355"/>The Difference betwixt an Atheist and an
Enthusiast is this: The Atheist thinks nothing Unlawful, as believing no
God to judge him: An Enthusiast thinks every Thing that comes into his Head
not only Lawful, but the Inspi∣ration of God, and as such is promp∣ted with
a fiery Zeal to propagate it with the Hazard of his Life, the over∣turning of
Government, and embroil∣ing the World: And when a Man is once fully
possess'd with this Spirit, which works upon his Imagination, his
Reason is wholly clouded, his Discourses are inconsistent, he has
nothing in his View but his present Impulse, and as that alters, he
pursues the quite con∣trary, with the same Vehemence, not reflecting that
it is opposite to his former Sentiments. Now this is most certainly a great
Excess of Pride, which yet recommends it self to many well∣inclined and
religiously disposed Peo∣ple, under the Notion of Abstraction from the
World, of Humility, and Self-Denial: For what greater Exalta∣tion of ones
self can be imagin'd, and indeed Rebellion against God, than to think my
self exempted, upon account of my own Holiness, from those
Insti∣tutions <PB N="317" REF="356"/> which God has appointed, and from that
Authority which he has or∣dain'd amongst Men, and by whose Hands he does
dispence his Blessings to us? What greater Delusion than to think, that
we can contrive a shorter and safer Way to Heaven than that which God hath
commanded us? Not to be contented with that Station wherein he hath placed us,
but to raise our selves above that Order by which he governs the World,
(who as long as they administer Justice are to be revered as God's
Vicegerents up∣on Earth;) to despise Dominion, and speak Evil of
Dignities, which is a sign of Reprobation: It is no less, than assuming
the Power of God to our selves, to usurp his Throne, and as far as in us
lies to take the Govern∣ment of the World out of his Hands: All this is the
Effect of Enthusiasm: All the Looseness and Wickedness of this Age is
to have no Principles, but guided wholly by our Humour and Fancy; and most of
the Heresies or Schisms which have divided the Church came from this
Fountain.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="357"/>St. <HI>Augustin</HI> tell us, That the
mighty Suc∣cess and strong Prosperity of the <HI>Romans</HI> was a Reward
given them by God for their eminent Justice and other Virtues: As to
particular Persons, the Providences of God are promiscuously given in
this World; so that we cannot certainly conclude, God's Love or Hatred to any
Person by any thing that befals him in this Life: But God deals otherwise
with Nations, because Publick States and Communities, as such, can only be
rewarded and punished in this World; for in the next, all Publick Societies
will be dissolved, and every Man shall give an Account of himself to
God: The great crying Sins of a Nation can∣not hope to escape Publick
Judgments, which God may defer for a Time to give People a longer space of
Repentance, but sooner or later they have Reason to expect his Vengeance.
God hath Lead∣en Feet, but Iron Hands, he is longere he punishes, but
strikes home at last; and usually the longer Punishment is delay'd, it
is the heavier when it comes. Experience in all Ages hath made this good We
find through the History of the Old Testament the interchangeable
Providences of God, towards the Peo∣ple <PB N="319" REF="358"/> of
<HI>Israel,</HI> always suited to their Manners. They were constantly
Pro∣sperous or Afflicted, as Virtue and Piety flourished and declined
amongst them. And thus God deals with all others: The <HI>Roman</HI> Empire,
whilst that People remained Virtuous, was firm and strong as Iron; but upon
Dissolution of their Manners, the Iron was soon mixed with miry Clay, and
the Feet upon which that Empire stood were soon broken.</P>

<PB REF="359"/>
<HEAD>Of KINGS and PRINCES, and the Education of a PRINCE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are found admira∣ble Occurrences in the Lives of all Men, but
much more in Princes, who moving in a higher Sphere, their Acti∣ons are more
conspicuous and worthy to be transmitted to Posterity, as In∣structive
to their Successors: And tho' Prosperity is more agreeable to our
Na∣ture, yet Adversity is more Benefi∣cial, when Princes make a right
Im∣provement of it, to shun those Rocks whereon some Princes have been
split.</P>
<P>It is very necessary to accustom a young Prince to divert
himself amongst plea∣sant Men; one cannot find a more sure and less
painful Way to render him a most accomplisht Prince, than having such
Courtiers about him in his Youth; (but the Difficulty is to find such:) A
Prince will not fail to learn insensibly <PB N="321" REF="360"/> the Manners
and Actions of those; and whatsoever he gains that way becomes Natural to
him. Those that are near him should make use, as much as is possible,
of that way to Instruct him; it being absolutely necessary, that
those who have Wit, and are well-bred Men, should not only be receiv'd by
the Prince, but that Means be taken to find them out, for commonly such Men
are not over-forward to shew themselves: They know how to be Content with
their own small Fortunes; and besides, such Men are so rarely met with,
that those who understand them, need not fear to be troubled with too many
of them; for I do not remember, in all my Time, (who have spent many Years in
the World) to have seen so few of them as at present.</P>
<P>To make a Prince speak well, it is necessary to mix a little
Art and Study, and a Prince ought to have something of both; for to the
compleating of a worthy honest Man, there is nothing more necessary than
well-Speaking and well-Doing: What Gracefulness so clear a Source gives to
all our Actions? How doth it beautifie our Words and Thoughts? How amiable a
Thing it is <PB N="322" REF="361"/> to Speak well when Sincerity goes along with
it?</P>
<P>Young Princes are commonly more Active than Speculative, and most
ea∣sily carried away with the Pleasures of the World; yet there are some,
who by Nature are serious enough, and are capable to retire into
themselves, as King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and King <HI>James</HI> the
Second. It were to be wished, that a young Prince, be neither too Active, nor
too Serious, the best Temper is to partake of both, and be able to pass
with Ease from the one to the other. Some Attempts might be made to give a
young Prince the Apprehension of certain Things with which Children are not
to entertain themselves, as surpassing their ordinary Capacity; for
tho' a Child understands not at first what is said to them, yet it
prepares him a∣gainst another time, and they are as lit∣tle Essays of
Reason, which come not all at once. It is necessary for him that would
attain Virtues, to begin gradually at the lowest Step, to guard his Senses,
and set a watch upon the Avenues of his Passions, for Man becomes neither
perfectly Virtuous or Vitious all at once; and <HI>Jesus</HI> the Son of
<HI>Syrach</HI> hath said, <PB N="323" REF="362"/> <HI>He that contemns little
Things shall fall by little and little.</HI> The smallest Occasion
suffices to say something that pleases; and it is of much Importance to
form a Prince's Will agreeably, for then he will take Pleasure to hearken to
a Man that hath Judgment and Wit, and will be desirous to be instructed by
him: And if Persons about a Prince have a Grace in their Words and Acti∣ons,
the Prince will retain the Manner how to behave and express himself. This
agreeable way of Talking is of great Consequence, and the surest way to
acquire it, is to let such as have and practise it, come into the Prince's
Com∣pany: Those Princes who are young, and understand not all that's said
to them, want often that some Body put them in Mind; and when Princes keep
Com∣pany with such, they take some Obser∣vations which they should
never have of themselves; and we our selves find, if many Things had been
discover'd to us in our Youth, which we have since found by our own
Experience and Re∣flections, we had saved much Time; and one Word to the
Purpose then, had made us comprehend a World of Things, which we know not,
nor shall ever know whilst we live: But we reflect not 
<PB N="324" REF="363"/> on those Opportunities till we have lost them, and
we are not aware of them, till it be too late: All the World com∣mits Faults,
but the greatest are only perceived.</P>
<P>Those who have the Education of young Princes should endeavour
to make them Love or Hate that, which deserves the one or the other, that the
Prince may have a good Taste or Discernment, for this would make him
understand what he should Learn, and the Means to be excellent in it: For
if a Prince had be∣forehand a right Apprehension of Good and Evil, the very
Course of Things would instruct him, and the Aversion to what is Evil,
whensoever he saw it, would be sufficient to avoid it: A young Prince
cannot have too curious a Taste to discern betwixt true and false
Plea∣sures, and not to be deceiv'd in either. The most agreeable way of
instructing, is, to do that Well, which we see others do Ill, by which we
make our Life more easie: Besides, those that are about a young Prince,
should endeavour, that the Wit and Heart of the Prince should be
disposed as they ought to be: 'Tis true that Wit finds out the way to
at∣tain Perfection, but the Heart is neces∣sary to put in Practice what is
judged <PB N="325" REF="364"/> to be the <HI>Best</HI>; and that which we call
the having a good Taste or Discernment is oftenest found in a young
Prince, who is usually born with more than an ordinary Genius; tho' a late
Emi∣nent Philosopher holds, That all Chil∣dren Naturally have near the same
Ca∣pacity, and that the chief Difference proceeds from the Care that is taken
to inform Children: But I think the first Advantage is rather to be
ascribed to a happy Birth, and that Art does af∣terwards perfect it; and I
have always believed we should not so much wish for any thing in a young
Prince, as Wit, it being impossible not to have it, if he be Educated in
the Company of some People; as to the learning by <HI>ones</HI> self, it
very seldom happens that the Mind, without some extraordinary Help, takes
the right Course to do it: 'Tis true indeed, our late King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Second was a very excellent and knowing Man, and had a great Insight into
Men and Manners; tho' in his Youth, by the Reason of our intestine
Troubles, and the Rebellion raised a∣gainst his Royal Father, he was Taught
very little; yet he had an excellent Go∣vernor in his tender Years, which was
the Marquis of <HI>Hartford,</HI> and after him, <PB N="326" REF="365"/> the
Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>; but when that Prince went Generalissimo into
the <HI>West</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> his Highness had the poor∣est and
<HI>weakest</HI> Man for his Governor that I ever saw; yet they who had
In∣terest in the Prince, and were near a∣bout him, instructed him in so
pleasant a Way, that he was most agreeable in Conversation; And when he
came to the Throne, if he had loved Business as well as he understood it,
he had been one of the greatest Princes of the last Age; but he was wholly
addicted to his Pleasures, and Chamber-Practice, which much shortned his
Days; and yet he may be reckon'd amongst the most admir'd Princes of his
Time, who had form'd and instructed himself a∣mongst the best-bred
Princes in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
<P>A young Prince should never be over burthen'd with a long Chain of
Instru∣ctions; his Tutor should rather chuse to speak few Things, and
let each Pre∣cept take its Effect, and should give the Prince a Reason of
all he tells him; so that the Prince of his own Accord might insensibly
make the Application to him∣self; it being much better to enlighten his
Understanding, than to charge his Memory.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="366"/>And above all Things, he should teach the
Prince to be Free and Affable, which Virtues make Princes to be belov'd; and it
is of great Consequence for a young Prince to have the Art of ma∣king
himself be belov'd: When Majesty and Civility are mix'd together, it makes
Men find with Pleasure that such Princes are their Masters. The more
Princes condescend, the more ready are their Servants to submit,
especially if they be well-bred Persons, who never presume too much. The
most Eminent Princes were wont to communicate freely, and were very familiar:
<HI>Caesar</HI> was so with his own Soldiers, which so charm'd them, that
when they fought for his Glory, they found nothing difficult, and were not
apprehensive of Danger, (Heaven takes those Hearts into its Protection,)
and in fighting Fifty Battels, which <HI>Cae∣sar</HI> did without losing
one, he was always very Active, and yet never re∣ceiv'd any Hurt: Such Princes
are al∣ways belov'd; and tho' Fortune (which is ever inconstant) leaves their
Side, yet Glory and Honour never forsake them.</P>
<P><HI>Caesar</HI> was of this Number: He had nothing in him, which
savour'd not of Grandeur; he was brave and full of <PB N="328" REF="367"/>
Civility; he would hazard his own Per∣son, to save the meanest of his
Soldiers. He lov'd all those that loved his Fortune; he shar'd with them
the Glory, as he did the Danger; he understood well how to make himself be
Belov'd, <HI>Ʋt Ameris, Ama,</HI> which is a sure way if it be perform'd
handsomely; the principal Secret consists in managing it so, that the
Persons whom one loves should be glad of it.</P>
<P>There is nothing so much to be fear'd in a young Prince, as giving
him an ill Master; for the best Natural Parts would be but of little use,
if Care be not taken to improve them: One can never take any thing right
without having learnt it; and who can believe that either to do a Thing well,
or to do it better, if one doth it well, that Study can ever hinder it: We
see in all Exercises, how much good Masters are necessary; and it
were very strange, that the Body should be capable of Instruction, and
not the Mind; for what likelyhood is there, that Practice and good Masters
are effectual to make a young Man skillful in riding the Great Horse, and
that to the making of an accomplish'd Person, they should both be
needless.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="368"/>The Body and the Mind are sel∣dom as one
would wish; but the De∣fects of the Body seem more difficult to be
corrected; for the Mind is na∣turally supple, and may be redress'd if a
right Course be taken; and the Rea∣son why it falls out otherwise is,
when we learn to do a Thing of an ill Master, one learns to do it ill; and it
is much more difficult to chuse good Masters for framing the Mind, than for
the Body, for the Advantages of the Bo∣dy are much more remarkable than those
of the Mind: To be able and well∣bred to such a Degree as one would have a
great Prince, one cannot know too many Things, if we have Skill to make a right
Use of them, and know how to Value them; but to have read much, or to have
learnt a Number of different Opinions, discovers nothing of Certainty; for we
know nothing well but what we see clearly, and that which we can make others
see presently, and understand if they be clear-sighted, and we should
mistrust all which we see as through a Cloud, and which we cannot make
plain to the Sight of another. There are some Princes who would have been
very gallant Men, if Care had been taken at first to put them in a right way,
<PB N="330" REF="369"/> and to have shew'd them what was to be done. For a
great Prince, upon whom the Happiness of the Publick de∣pends, by whose
Example his People will fashion themselves, as being the most noble
Model, no Care in the World should be neglected: The Business is to make
a young Prince Happy, and that all who live under him may be so; it being
reasonable that those should a little share in the Happiness who are
in Duty ob∣liged to Sacrifice themselves for prosecu∣ting of it; and
therefore this first Point of their Education is of much greater Im∣portance
to them, than to private Per∣sons: For when Princes are no longer under the
Conduct of Governors, all that they do, or say, is approv'd, or at least it
is so in Appearance; For no Person comes into their Presence but with a
design to please them, because altho' he loves them, yet one easily
inclines to love their Favour more; and it were a great Imprudence for any Man
to draw the Hatred of his Prince upon himself, and to advise him as he
would one of his particular Friends, unless at first the Prince had
signified his Pleasure to have it so: However, those Persons that are
near about Princes that be young, (if they are not too much sway'd by
Inte∣rest) <PB N="331" REF="370"/> may very securely tell them in an
agreeable manner, all which may con∣tribute to their Glory and Happiness:
'Tis certain, a very easie Thing to give them good Advice as to their Glory,
but it is not so to their Happiness, which depends more upon the Tem∣per;
and whosoever will ascertain a Prince what will make him happy, must know
him perfectly well, for most com∣monly we our selves know not what would be
best for our own Happiness: But when all is done, it seems to me, that
with a very little Help, it were no difficult Thing for a young Prince to be
happy.</P>
<P>Certainly, that young Prince is in a fair way to it, who sees
himself one of the first amongst the Masters of the World, and that
Fortune hath nothing greater to give. And therefore Princes should consider
what Pleasure it is to do good, that there is nothing more Noble, and that
this Delight was made only for Princes. For the more Fa∣vours they bestow,
the more they are in Condition to grant, provided their Gifts be with Choice
and Esteem, which supports their Grandeur, and renders them more Powerful:
It is not Riches that are principally desir'd from Kings, but 
<PB N="332" REF="371"/> Employments and Trusts, and that which makes Men
desire high Com∣mands, is not for Conveniency of Life, for their Lives are by
them made more troublesome; but it is Hopes of making it appear, that they
have Merit in them and are useful to the Publick; and when just Persons
that have Worth and Fide∣lity are put into Employments, they make themselves
soon known, and their Princes are well serv'd: We have lately seen in
<HI>England,</HI> a sad Example of ta∣king false Measures herein; the ill
Choice of our late King's Ministers was his Ruin: Besides, what greater
Slavery can there be, than that Princes are chain'd to their Posts, and
cannot make themselves <HI>less,</HI> all their Words and Actions are
descant∣ed upon, and made publick Discourse. A Prince cannot with Dignity
quit his Guards. Fortune hath him in Custody, a Train besets him where-ever
he goes, and there is no making an Escape, but still he that is the
Master of many is the Servant of more.</P>
<P>The great and honourable Fame of a King in this World depends more
upon his wise Administration than upon his private Morals; the Goodness
of his Government depends chiefly upon those that advise him, and execute
under him; it being an infallible Maxim, <HI>That he</HI> <PB N="333" REF="372"/> <HI>is the worst (at least the most unhappy) King, who hath
the worst Councellors and Ministers under him.</HI></P>
<P>Princes should endeavour to couple Warlike and peaceable Virtues
together, to know at all times how to Rule their own State, and protect their
Subjects; to honour the Good, and chastise the Wicked; to change the
Pleasures of the Body into those of the Mind, to seek their Content in
the Acquisition of those Things which may raise them above o∣ther
Persons: But this Perfection is not easily met with at Court, where every
Thing stands in Opposition to good De∣signs; Princes are born to govern,
and therefore they must govern well, with∣out amusing themselves with
Knowledge more curious than useful, which would better become a Professor
of Philoso∣phy than a Prince.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but Sciences do adorn the Titles of Princes, as
Diadems do their Heads, and Jewels their Crowns, but the most necessary
Philosophy for a Prince, is to know how to do Justice to his People, and to
defend them from their Enemies, and to understand what Persons are able to
serve him well; ne∣vertheless many Princes enter upon the Government before
they have pass'd an <PB N="334" REF="373"/> Apprentiship for it, and take
least Care of what concerns them most.</P>
<P>Foreign Languages are most neces∣sary for a Prince, and
serve for a great Ornament to him; the Princes Electors of <HI>Germany</HI>
would admit no Man here∣tofore to the Imperial Dignity, unless he was able to
speak <HI>Latin, Italian, Sclavonian</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>; and the
Empe∣ror <HI>Frederick</HI> the Second could besides speak elegant
<HI>French, Spanish</HI> and <HI>Tur∣kish,</HI> which was very rare in his
time: He was also skilful in the ancient vulgar <HI>Greek</HI>; and indeed
the Intercourse of Princes, who live upon the Continent, permits them not to
neglect these Lan∣guages without running a great Incon∣veniency. The
<HI>English</HI> Genius for clear speaking and writing is always to the
Point; they look upon rambling Dis∣couses with Contempt, and as Men of
Reason, they stand more upon Strength of Argument, than all the Pomp of
Rhe∣torick, not so much concern'd to move the Hearer's Affections, as to warm
his Reason. Perhaps no Nation is more Satyrical and quicker in Repar∣tees,
which argues Wit to express them∣selves significantly; we have a most
hap∣py Language, compounded chiefly of <HI>Saxon, Latin</HI> and
<HI>French,</HI> of which <PB N="335" REF="374"/> <HI>Saxon</HI> is the Stock,
the other two being ingrafted into it. The <HI>English</HI> is so
significant that it does almost equalize the <HI>Greek,</HI> and does even
exceed the <HI>Latin,</HI> in a particular Grace of com∣pounding Words, which
is as great a Beauty as can be in Language. In Point of Sweetness, the
<HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> run smoother, but they want Sinews,
especially the last. The <HI>Spanish</HI> is Ma∣jestical but
boisterous; the High-<HI>Dutch</HI> Manly, but very harsh; whereas the
<HI>En∣glish</HI> is both sweet and manly. If we look upon the famous Men
of our Nation, which have been Learned, or Soldiers, we shall find many very
famous, as Venerable <HI>Bede,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Moor,</HI> Lord <HI>Bacon,
Smith, Spelman, Camden, Selden, Daniel, Drayton, Ben. Johnson, Shake∣spear,
Beaumont, Fletcher,</HI> Sir <HI>Philip Sidney, Cowley, Oldham, Dryden,</HI>
and ma∣ny others. But is impossible to learn Lan∣guages without travelling,
which em∣bellishes the Minds of those that use it prudently: A young
Prince that travels will understand Nations, imitate what they have of good,
and avoid the rest; he should heedfully regard the Laws and Fundamental
Maxims of State, the Inclinations of Sovereigns, their Reve∣nues, the Order of
their Courts, their <PB N="336" REF="375"/> Alliances, their Power, and their
Fa∣vourites; that Prince who hath seen <HI>Europe</HI> with Judgement knows
every thing that can carry him to glorious Acti∣ons, and certainly a young
Prince that travils, profits more in two Years, than if he had stay'd in his
Study ten Years; Travel teaches them to understand the Plenty of Countries,
the Force of Ri∣vers, and which are the most eminent Places of Traffick and
Commerce, the Convenience of Bridges, the distance of Places, the Strength
and Situation of Cities and Castles, the Number of the People, the
Inclination of the Subjects, the Humour of Princes, the Sympathy and Antipathy
of Nations, and many other things which may instruct a General of an Army to
fortifie Places, to entrench, to Camp an Army advan∣tagiously, to draw up a
Body of Men in Battle, to lead an Army to fight, and to shew themselves
eminent Examples to their Followers. Travel also gives a Prince Lessons
of Temperance, Mode∣sty and Patience; and the Languages which are useful to
all Men are most ne∣cessary to Princes, and to those who would have any
Command of Armies. <HI>Spanish</HI> is the noblest of all Bastard
Lan∣guages, it not being a Mother-Tongue, <PB N="337" REF="376"/> but compounded
of <HI>Latin, Gothick, A∣rabick</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI>: The <HI>Romans,
Goths</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> having reign'd some Ages in that Country, did
introduce a Mix∣ture of all those Languages. A Prince should also learn
the Mathematicks, which will teach him to besiege, and fortifie Places.
These are the most needful Studies for a Prince, and not to spend his
time upon Logical Noti∣ons, but to chuse such Studies as are proportionable
to his Condition: It is sufficient that a Prince be ready in sa∣cred and
prophane History; that he take a Delight in some Books, and sometimes
consult the dead, who will say that which none of the living dare say to
him; he should read such Books as may teach him to know the Condi∣tion of
his Friends and Enemies; he should learn Principles of Generosity and
Honour distinctly; to know those that love the Publick Good and
Inte∣rest, and to favour them with such Of∣fices as they deserve, and to
punish them that do otherwise: And tho' it be honourable for Kings to
aggrandize their best Deserving Subjects, yet a Prince ought not to
diffuse his Graces too pro∣digally, least the Servant should become the
Master; which in all Courts, and at <PB N="338" REF="377"/> all times hath
proved very prejudicial. The Planets would have little Regard to the Sun, if
they had no need of his Light, nor a Servant of his Master, if he could do
him no good; Princes ought therefore to be circumspect in Distribution of
their Favours, if they would not lose that Honour and Re∣spect which their
Subjects give them. A King gives an Account of his Acti∣ons to none but God; he
ought ne∣vertheless to act equitably, and not to plunge brave Men into
Despair, than which nothing is more dangerous, who having lost their
Estates by their most faithful and long Services, thinking they have
nothing more to lose, are capable to make the greatest report of their
Wrongs; 'tis true, Kings may take the Benefits bestowed, when they that
received them become unworthy of them; but before a King comes to that
Extremi∣ty, he should endeavour to reduce them to their Duty, and having
tried all fair Ways, the Prince must be careful not faintly to execute his
Resolution, nor rashly to enter upon a great Action, which in Prudence he
must afterwards abandon. A Prince should think seri∣ously of a Thing
before he enters up∣on it, but having begun, he should car∣ry 
<PB N="339" REF="378"/> it through, for there is nothing more repugnant to
Authority of Kings than to act by halfs, nor any thing that en∣courages
Subjects so much to Rebelli∣on as to see their Masters are afraid of
them. A Prince ought to spend some Time in reading, especially History,
which will render him able and know∣ing, and it is a good Guide, and what
concerns Life which it does antidate, and makes the Reader contemporary with
the Times past, and by running up beyond his Nativity, the Prince will be
something the wiser for it, and will have a Stock of Sense, without much
Trouble of his own; and it is of great Use to perswade by Example that
which we have a Mind to. History is a kind of Experience, and we may reap
much by it; besides there are some Histories written by so good Hands,
which tho' we know, yet it is a Pleasure to read them, as <HI>Thucidides,
Polibius, Caesar</HI>'s <HI>Commentaries,</HI> with the Duke of
<HI>Ro∣han</HI> and Sir <HI>Clement Edmond</HI>'s Observa∣tions upon them,
and <HI>Hugo Grotius de Jure Pacis &amp; Belli,</HI> and <HI>Selden</HI>'s
<HI>Mare clausum</HI>; but to read over much, and to be constantly poring
upon Books, brings neither Pleasure nor Profit. Read∣ing too much
over-charges Nature; it <PB N="340" REF="379"/> is Thought and Digestion that
makes Reading profitable, which being well managed gives a great Insight into
all Things. He that depends upon his own Experience, hath but a few Mate∣rials
to work upon, and to take Mea∣sures wholly from Books without look∣ing into
Men and Business, is like tra∣velling in a Map, where only Countries and
Cities are well distinguish'd; but Villages and private Houses are
seldom or never marked.</P>
<P>Young Princes, after some Hours in their Study, should bestow
some others upon Sports, because the Mind being taken up too long with
Contemplation will disrelish Study, if it be not refresh∣ed with some
Recreations, in which Hunting is one of the most agreeable to Princes; and
because Youth runs easi∣ly down the Hill towards Pleasures, therefore
Princes should sometimes play at Tennis; tho' most commonly young Princes
would rather endure the Pains of Hunting a whole Day than study∣ing but two
Hours, which they think a Labour, which is really nothing but pure Delight, and
Studying would be a sensual Pleasure, if the Mind were capable of any in
those younger Years. For those that have once tasted it can 
<PB N="341" REF="380"/> never take themselves off again in such Manner that
they become despicable and good for nothing else. As for Ex∣ercises,
Hunting has always been the Recreation of Princes, nor never dise∣steemed
but by those that know not the Benefit of it. It withdraws the great Men
about the Prince from Idle∣ness, which is the Mother of all Vi∣ces, or from
Gaming, which is unsuit∣able to their Condition: It makes Prin∣ces strong,
active and bold. Almost all Princes love Hunting, and apply them∣selves to
it, because it is a Representa∣tion of War; a good Huntsman is, or may
easily be a good Soldier. To sur∣prize the Wolf or the Fox, a Man must
use a certain Subtilty, which teaches us to lay Ambushes for the Enemy. To
take a wild Boar, one must know how to present the Boar Spear to
Ad∣vantage, just as one would do a Pike or a Halbert when two Bodies of
Sol∣diers come to push of Pike. To shoot a Deer or Hare running, a Patridge
or a Quale flying, one must be as good a Marks-man as the best Fusileer
in the Army; besides, Hunting enures a Prince to endure Hunger, Thirst,
Heat, Cold, Rain, Snow, and all the Incommodities of <PB N="342" REF="381"/> the
Air, without which it is impossible to be a good Soldier.</P>
<P>I confess, Princes should endeavour to couple Moral and Martial
Virtues to∣gether: I know Liberality is counted the proper Virtue of a Prince,
it being much better for him to be Profuse than Covetuous, Prodigality having
a resem∣blance of something more noble than Avarice, and really it is
less odious: Nay, those that gain by it make it pass for a Virtue; but
perhaps it is more pre∣judicial to Posterity, and more dange∣rous than the
other Extream: For tho' a King should give away his whole King∣dom, he would
not satisfie all that ask: No, nor all that think they deserve much of him:
It is then more convenient to give with Reason, and never to draw so near
the Bottom, but that the Prince may always have wherewith to gratifie Persons
of Merit; and above all, the Prince should take special Care, that his
Liberalities be exercised without op∣pressing his People, to avoid
Murmu∣ring, which is the ready way to pro∣duce Rebellion. But there is little
need at this Time of making Laws against giving too much, Princes are not too
free in this Age; and there are not many that want an Overseer in 
<PB N="343" REF="382"/> this kind, especially in our <HI>English</HI> Court.
It is certain, that Kings, by the Eminency of their Places, are highly obliged
to Integrity, because the least Blemish in them grows up to a monstrous
Deformity. They are the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> upon which all other Orbs
depend; and <HI>Assiadorus</HI> says it were more credible that Nature
should Err, than for a Prince to frame a Commonwealth different from the
Constitution of his own Life; he being a Glass issuing forth Incentives
to Imitation; and where that is wanting, the Government cannot long
subsist. Was not <HI>Rome</HI> Warlike under <HI>Romulus,</HI> Religious
under <HI>Numa,</HI> Con∣tinent under <HI>Fabricius,</HI> Dissolute under
<HI>Lucullus</HI> and <HI>Antony,</HI> Idolatrous under <HI>Julian,</HI>
Immerged in <HI>Arianism</HI> under <HI>Valens?</HI> To shew that People
are always moulded into the Temper of their Prince, and where that is not, the
Government is short. And we find in Holy Writ, Judgment threatned to Princes,
who have been a Snare instead of a Sanctua∣ry to their Subjects: And St.
<HI>Augustin</HI> calls them the worst of Homicides, in destroying the
Souls of their Subjects; and therefore that King who under∣stands his Duty to
God, cannot be ig∣norant, how many Obligations of Vir∣tue <PB N="344" REF="383"/> are annexed to a Crown, since the Lives of his Subjects are
shaded under his Protection; and since a King medi∣ates between God and his
People, it is as necessary that he should adhere first to God, as he
would have his People be faithful to him; so that he must in the first
Place consecrate himself, next his Kingdom, to the Service of his Creator;
and whoever does not this, he overturns both Divine and Humane Laws: Kings are
not to be esteemed Happy for their Conquests, but by using their Power in
the Advancement of God's Honour and Service. The Royal Dignity is not
sufficiently great of it self to render him Happy that injoys it, by the
sole considering what he is; for if a King be left alone without any
Com∣pany, to think of himself at Leisure, he will find himself to be a
Man full of Miseries, and that feels them as well as other common Persons;
and therefore carefully to avoid this, there never fail to be near the
Persons of Kings a great many that continually watch to make Divertisements
for Princes, and supply their leisure Time, with Pleasures and
Pastimes, that none of their Time may be vacant; which is to say, that
Kings are encompassed round with Persons that <PB N="345" REF="384"/> are
very careful Kings should not be alone to think of themselves, knowing very
well that a King, as he is, he would be very Miserable if he should be left
alone; and indeed, the chief thing that supports Men in great Employments is,
that they are perpetually hindred from Thinking of themselves, for it is the
Noise and Bustle that divert us, and is most grateful; Men have a
secret Instinct that intices them to seek Divertisements, which
proceeds from the continual Sense of their Misery, and they feel another
secret Instinct that remains from the Greatness of their first Nature,
which makes them know that their Happiness consists only in Rest; and
these two con∣trary Instincts flatter them, that the Sa∣tisfaction they
expect will come, by open∣ing the Door that will admit them to Rest, which is
usually sought by strug∣gling with some Opposition in vain: And
therefore <HI>Cyneas</HI> the Philosopher said well to <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI>
who promised he would enjoy his Pleasures with his Friends, when he had
conquered a good Part of the World: But <HI>Cyneas</HI> told him, he would do
better to advance his own Happiness by injoying that Rest present∣ly,
than to seek it by so many Troubles; but <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> could not be
Happy, either <PB N="346" REF="385"/> before or after Conquering a great Part of
the World; and the sensual Life his Ministers advised him to was less
able to content him, than the Agitation of so great Wars, and so many
Voyages as he designed.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, Man hunts after Felici∣ty in all his Actions; for all
Men desire to be Happy, and what ever different Means they use, all tends
to this End; it is the same Desire in both, that in∣clines one to go the
War, and the other not to go; the Will doth never move one Step, but with
regard to this Object of Felicity: It is the true and real Mo∣tive of all Men's
Actions; nay, even of those that Hang themselves: When Peo∣ple believe
their Prince is Liberal, Va∣liant, and Prudent, they will more rea∣dily obey
his Will and receive his Com∣mands with Respect; but to gain the Reputation
of being a Prudent Prince, he should be very careful that his Mini∣sters
and Servants be Friends to the Publick Good, that they be Affable, Modest and
Generous: The Prince must shew a constant Resolution to maintain his
People in their ancient Splendour: That Adversity cast him not down, nor
Prosperity make him Insolent; and to give a fairer Lustre to his
Liberality, <PB N="347" REF="386"/> he should take Care that what he bestows
do not arise out of the Oppression of any, and being such without
drawing his Sword, or giving much to his Sub∣jects, his Friends and Enemies too
will esteem him Valiant, Liberal, and Pru∣dent, and all of them fearing to
offend him, will pay him the Duties of Sub∣jects, Friends and Neighbours; and
he need not doubt but God will dissipate his Enemies, and all the mutinous
ma∣licious Designs of his malicious Subjects and ambitious Neighbours.</P>
<P>We must know that Kings are consi∣dered in a double Capacity,
that of Na∣ture and that of Policy; the Politick Body never dies, and is never
defective of Authority or Direction; the Acts of the Body Politick are not
abated by the Natural Body's Access. The Body Po∣litick is not disabled to

the Dutchy of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> made by <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, were
resolved by all the Judges to be good, tho' made in the King's Minority; and
the Change of Religion made by <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth in his Mino∣rity was
good, tho' he had not Age to discern what he did, being then in the Hands of
his Uncle the Protector; and if Catholicks should pretend to make void the
Change of Religion made in that King's Time, because of his Mino∣rity, they
would be laughed at by all the World, and their Pretence would be
ridiculous.</P>

<HEAD>Of MAN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Transactions of this World are the most unplea∣sant
Speculations that ever entertained my Mind; the whole Off-spring of Nature
moveth as at first, but only Man, who was design'd Master of the whole,
runs a Course contrary to all Order, and the whole Progeny of <HI>Adam</HI>
is obnoxious to his Original Guilt. We have innate Affections and
Propensities to do Evil, since our first Mother's Converse with the
Serpent, and the sad Effects of <HI>A∣dam</HI>'s Fate are derived to all; but
yet no Evil is in us, but the Cure is in our own Power; no poisonous Herb
sprouts out, but in the same Field its Antidote is placed. It is therefore
a Wonder that Men who know they have rational Souls, should only follow the
Dictates of Sense, and for one Hour of Pleasure here, suf∣fer an Eternity
of Torments hereafter; for by embracing our Heady Appetites, we have chang'd
the whole Mass of our Nature, and have set our selves a diame∣trical 
<PB N="350" REF="389"/> Opposition to all that is called good; so that all
our Actions are impertinent, and we level our Designs at a false End, and
we wander in those Paths which will lead us to the Gates of
Destruction.</P>
<P>The Enjoyment of what the World affords is that we only seek
after. The Devil began with these in his first Temp∣tation of <HI>Eve</HI>
in Paradise; and it seems he had not, four thousand Years after, found
out three better Engines for his Turn than these; for he used the very
same in the Wilderness to our Saviour, <HI>the promised Seed of the
Woman,</HI> that he had prevail'd with on <HI>Eve</HI> her self in
Paradise, so long before. <HI>Make these Stones bread</HI>; there's the
Lust of the Flesh. <HI>He shews him all the Kingdoms of the World,</HI>
there's the Lust of the Eyes: <HI>Cast thy self down from the Pin∣nacle,
the Angels are thy Guard to bear thee up in their Hands</HI>; there's the Pride
of Life. 'Tis true, the Devil can do no more but tempt us, his Power (how∣ever
great) is limited, tho' we cannot easily set out the Bounds of it; he has
his Chains of Restraint, as well as Tor∣ment: It seems an Invasion of
God's Prerogative, and a giving the Devil more than his Due, to allow him a
Power of immediate and impressive <PB N="351" REF="390"/> Injection into our
Minds, without the Help of our own innate Corruptions; for 'tis by these we
hold the Candle to him, and the Wedge too of the Temp∣tation whilst he drives
it; the Mud is still in the Bottom, he does but stir it up by shaking it,
or drawing it forth by some outward Objects. There is no easier Way to
out-reach a Man, than to out-end him. If once the Devil can get a Man to
shoot with him in his own Bow, and make his Engines a Man's End, the Match is
lost (as we use to say) in the very making.</P>
<P>Now if any Man will but seriously try, he shall find it more
possible to with-hold his Affection from the Things of this World, than
enjoy the Satisfacti∣on of his Taste in it. <HI>Socrates</HI> had more true
Joy in safely looking on all the O∣lympick Games, and thanking the Gods, that
they had made him not to need the many things they had made for o∣thers
Pursuits, than <HI>Alcibiades</HI> in his ha∣zardous obtaining them, which
made <HI>Socrates</HI> cry out, <HI>Quos diderunt dii qui∣bus non indigeo.</HI>
'Tis worth our Obser∣vation to consider the Toil that such Men take, who
are in love with the Pleasures of this World, to eternize, if possible,
their earthly Happiness by a <PB N="352" REF="391"/> Succession of
Variety, and to take off the Weariness of one Pleasure by a∣nother, between
the Oil and the Wine, as <HI>Seneca</HI> speaks. <HI>Homines inter vinum
&amp; oleum occupati</HI>; but all in vain; for after those few evaporated
Minutes of Pleasure, the Body quietly fails the Mind, and the Mind the
Desire, and the Desire the Satisfaction, and all the Man. There is indeed
nothing more in all these Pleasures, besides bare Imagination and
Expectation, which tho' they may draw out the Affections, do never sa∣tisfie
them, nay, do the more dissatis∣fie and disappoint them, and Pleasure
is but an Earnest laid down for Grief, if not for Ruin.</P>
<P>This Adventure hath no other Re∣turn, and if this be a Man's End,
'tis an End that quickly ends both it self and him: Many have come to their
End by it, never any enjoy'd their End in it. <HI>Alexander</HI> was a greater
Conque∣ror in overcoming his own Desire of seeing <HI>Darius</HI> his Wife
and Daughters, than in subduing them, <HI>Victor Magis Darii uxorem, non
videndo quam Da∣rium vincendo.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place, we shall see some Men rake Riches together,
as Children <PB N="353" REF="392"/> do Snow, rowling it up with no little Pains
and Hazards of their Health, in∣to Heaps, and then fashioning them in∣to
Horses, Giants and Castles, and the next Shower washes them away, and
leaves nothing in the Place but Dirt. It was well said of
<HI>Themistocles,</HI> that great General, to a common Soldier, <HI>Thou who
art not</HI> Themistocles, <HI>take this Trash to thee,</HI> meaning the
Jewels and the rich <HI>Persian</HI> Spoils after a Victory. Wealth certainly
is one of the greatest Bankrupts in the World, and does not satisfie the
Debt it promises; for a Man may as soon fill a Quart Pot with Vir∣tue, as a
rational Mind with Wealth; there must be a Proportion between the Ingredient
and the Capacity. We call that Well, or Brain, empty, that hath not Water or
Wit; tho' the first be full of Air, the other of Vapour, they are still
empty of what should fill them, and so will the Heart of Man be, tho' never
so full of Wealth, and much of it doth but let us see, how much more of it
we want. The World is not so unequally dealt, as we talk, the Rich want a
Stomach oftner than the Poor do Meat: If the Poor Man's Hunger and Labour be
more, his Meat and Sleep are sweeter, and what Hap∣pinesses 
<PB N="354" REF="393"/> are these, that are as well not received as enjoyed,
as well wanted as had; the Will would certainly never be satisfy'd, if it had
all it desired, but one is presently satisfy'd if he renounces it; in
complying with the Will we shall never be at quiet, not complying with it, we
shall always be at rest. <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> have best
known the Happiness and Misery of Man, and have the best described it,
one of them the happiest, and the other the most wretched of Men; the one
knew the Vanity of all Pleasure, the other the Reality of all Evils, by
Experience.</P>
<P>Pleasure, instead of satisfying, doth satiate, but Riches
doth neither. For my own Part, my Humour does not much depend upon these
Things. I have always fair and soul Weather with∣in my self, good or ill
Success in my Affairs does not much move me, I sometimes set my self
against ill For∣tune, and the Glory of overcoming it makes me master it
with Pleasure; whereas at other Times I am very in∣different, and as it were
dissatisfy'd, e∣ven with Prosperity, looking upon Worldly Glory but as a
Fancy: If we fish for it, we shall find it nothing, an Apparition, like the
Night Mare in a <PB N="355" REF="394"/> Dream, you imagine it a Substance, you
grasp at it, you awake and it is nothing. Pleasure yet and Wealth will
abide a Sense or two; but this of Glory can neither be felt, seen or
understood; be∣sides the Slipperiness of it should make us undervalue
it. (Let us remember the Consul <HI>Bibulus</HI> in his triumphant Chariot by
the Fall of a Tile-Stone from a House made a Sacrifice, before he could reach
the Capitol, to offer up the Bulls and Garlands he had prepared; or in that
prodigious Favourite <HI>Sejanus,</HI> whom the same Day saw attended by
the Se∣nate, and torn in Pieces by the People; nay we need not go so far
back,) we need but think of the <HI>De Wits</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> who
govern'd absolutely that Common Wealth, and were so torn in Pieces by the
People in the Morning, that there scarce remained ere Night so much as a
Mammeck of Flesh. It hath rai∣sed some, but it hath ruin'd more; and
those whom it hath most raised, it hath much ruin'd. <HI>Paucos beavit
sed &amp; plures perdidit, &amp; quos heavit perdidit.</HI> Certainly if
there be any thing glorious in this World, 'tis a Mind that contemns that
Glory. <HI>Diogenes</HI> had more of it by his Contempt than <HI>Alexander</HI>

<HEAD>Of CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Making or Marring is in the first Age of <HI>Children</HI>;
for then their Minds, by their Parent's Skill, no less than their Bodies, by
the Midwife's Hand, may with Ease be moulded into such a Fashion as will
be durable in After-Ages. The Seeds of Virtue should be so early Ingrafted
into them, that they should not know, whe∣ther Nature or Precepts were the
Teach∣ers of them. Many Parents do endea∣vour unseasonably to sow
Wisdom in them, which does but corrupt their Na∣tures, not yet ripe for
such Instructions; they should rather let them enjoy that Freedom which
Nature in Pity hath be∣stow'd on them, and not force them to endure the
Punishment of human Cares before they have deserv'd them; let harmless
Wantonness be freely allow'd <PB N="360" REF="399"/> them, and let them rather
fear, than feel the Correction of their Parents. To Colts and young Cattle we
freely allow an uncontrolled Freedom, least their first Strength (which is
then grow∣ing) should be hindred; and yet we are so blind in what we behold
in other Creatures, we either neglect, or will not understand in our own
Children, who after they have fulfill'd the Folly of their first Years, Age
does by little and little change their Desires, and the Roots of Virtue will
spring up in them; and therefore such as will call the raw Minds of
Children to too hasty a Ripe∣ness of Studies, are very Ignorant of the
Strength which Nature bestow'd on that Age: Some Children indeed have early
Wits; as <HI>Papyrius</HI>'s Childhood that was judged worthy of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Senate. The Humours of Children are very va∣rious; some seem
to be made of a bet∣ter Mould than others. There are often seen Presages of
future Abilities in Chil∣dren; as in <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who first founded the
<HI>Persian</HI> Monarchy, who was bred up and believed to be a Shepherd's
Child, till after a more strict Inquiry, he was found to be the Grand-child
of <HI>Astyages</HI>; and <HI>Cato,</HI> in his Infancy, was more than a
Child; but this is very uncertain, and <PB N="361" REF="400"/> they are often
deceiv'd, who by the Be∣haviour of Children will judge too ha∣stily of their
future Disposition; for it must be some great sign and firmly
con∣stant above the Levity of that Age, which must be brought as an
effectual Argu∣ment to judge of the Inclination of their future and flexible
Years. Tho' some Children are more governable, and ea∣sier gain'd by gentle
Usage, yet their Manners are generally according to their Education; the
neglect of Discipline, and the force of Example, makes the Difference, and
causes Children to suc∣ceed or miscarry; but those who are naturally
most inclin'd to Ill are in most Danger; and since Education is the chief
Reason of their first Principles, great Care must be taken to set the
Byass right at first, and that Virtue may be early in∣still'd into their
Minds, which will make their Lives happy for the future, and then Custom will
make it easie to them: And indeed, Children should be treated with great
Wariness; they should hear and see nothing that should be dangerous in
the Imitation, and the Indiscretion of Parents is very often of ill
Consequence in this Particular; which puts me in mind of what
<HI>Montaign</HI> says to this Purpose; who being present whilst the
Governante <PB N="362" REF="401"/> was hearing his Daughter read, and there
being an obscene Word, she for∣bad her the naming it; whereupon the Father
was very angry with the Gover∣nante, and said, <HI>She had done his Daugh∣ter
much hurt in taking Notice of that Word, which she should have let pass
without any Observation.</HI></P>
<P>Childhood is certainly the principal Time for Improvement, whilst
the Mind is at liberty, the Memory strong, Plea∣sures unknown to them; and
they are like white Paper, where you may Write what you please; and we
should never design Children to any Profession before their Capacities
are known, and their Genius and Inclinations examin'd; for otherwise their
Nature may be crossed, and to strive against the Stream is alto∣gether
in vain; and if Care were taken that the Inclinations of young Peo∣ple were
suited to their Professions, we should see them improve much faster
than they do; for Men must not endea∣vour to fly without Wings, and to
un∣dertake Business that is too hard for them: The Passions of young
Men often carry them with full Speed, when they want the Bridle and not the
Spur; and like a Ship without a Pilot, they often over-set themselves,
being launched with∣out <PB N="363" REF="402"/> Ballast, and wanting a
Compass to Steer by, they are soon under Water: And indeed, Youth without
good Breed∣ing is in a dangerous Condition, and soon lost, being subject
to great Rash∣ness; and therefore those that are Young should be very
careful of their Carriage, since we see oftentimes those that are very
promising in their Youth, flag at the last, and fall short of
Expectation.</P>
<P>Young Men, at their first Entrance into Man's Estate, the Heat
of Blood breeds in them a wonderful Change, carries away their Mind with a Tide
of inconsiderate Confidence and vain Se∣curity, they know not how to be
Pro∣vident for After-times, neither can they consider how obnoxious they are
to the Ruins of Fortune.</P>
<P>The Office of Childhood is to Learn, and retain by a strong
Memory, the Deeds and Speeches of their Ancestors; of Youth, to invent and
speak Things altogether new; of middle Age, to mo∣derate it self by
Observation from both the former, for then our Bodies and Minds are
exceedingly changed from what they were heretofore; and as we grow in Years,
our Pleasures and Incli∣nations are not the same, even our Man∣ners, and
all our Desires, are much dif∣ferent, <PB N="364" REF="403"/> and moulded as
it were a-new. No Age of Man is more cunning than the middle Age, in
dissembling Friend∣ship, and governing their Affections. It can then
wonder at it self, that it could so improvidently go astray, and
endea∣vours to repair the Ruins of his younger Years, and renews with much
Vigour the Errors of the same. Memory is e∣ver greatest in Children, being
then able to retain what they learn, and still safely store it up in the
Closets of their Memory; but as Age increases it will decay, and therefore
their Minds ought to be fill'd with profitable History whilst they are
young; for Memory is like the Dew, which in hot Countries falls up∣on the
Leaves of Holly, unless it be ga∣ther'd by break of Day, it vanishes at Sun
Rising. Things of little Labour and no Judgement, will easily be at∣tain'd
by Children, who are neither strong for Labour, nor ripe for Judg∣ment.</P>
<P>Publick Ministers, when they have a Mind to prolong their Families
in Ho∣nour, should always breed at least one of their Children in their
Office under them. This the <HI>French</HI> do constantly practise, which
is disused in <HI>England,</HI> to the great Prejudice of the Crown, 
<PB N="365" REF="404"/> where those great Places are most com∣monly sold,
and commonly ignorant Men put into those great Employments, if they have but
Mony enough; believ∣ing great Places make great Men, which it always does, as
to their Estates, but very seldom as to their interior Qualifi∣cations,
which made King <HI>James</HI> the First say, <HI>That he had a Secretary
that could not write, and an Arch-Bishop who could not preach.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> have that wholesome Piece of Policy, that
the Son is always of the Father's Trade, and it is all the Learning he aims at,
which makes them admirable Artisans; for besides the Dex∣trousness and
Propensity of the Child, being lineally descended from so many of the
same Trade, the Father's more careful to instruct him, and to discover to
him all the Mystery of it; and this general Custom, or Law, keeps their
Heads from running at random after Book Learning and other Vocations. The
extravagant Custom of <HI>England</HI> herein is not to be commended, where
all Men aspire to Book Learning; when there is not a simpler Animal, and a
more superfluous Member of a State, than meer Scholar <HI>telluris inutile
pondus.</HI> The <HI>Goths</HI> forbore to destroy the Li∣braries 
<PB N="366" REF="405"/> of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> be∣cause
Books shou'd still keep them soft and simple to warlike Affairs. It is
re∣ported, that <HI>Grosthead,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lin∣coln,</HI> had a
Brother a Husbandman, who seeing his Brother come to that great Station, came
to him in Expecta∣tion of some great Preferment, or some∣thing very
considerable; but the Bishop told him, that if he wanted Mony to mend his
Plow or Cart, or to buy a new one; of if he wanted Tackling for his Horses,
or any other Things belonging to his Husbandry, he shou'd not want what was
fitting, but he wished him to aim no higher, for Husbandman he found him, and
a Husbandman he would leave him; and to shew the Force of Educa∣tion, and
that the learnedst Men are not always the wisest, there goes a fa∣mous
Story of <HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> and Saint <HI>Bonaventure,</HI> being both
invited to Dinner by the <HI>French</HI> King, on pur∣pose to observe their
Humours, being brought into the Room where the Ta∣ble was cover'd and made
ready, the first fell to eating of Bread as fast as he could, and at last
breaking out of a brown Stu∣dy, he cry'd out <HI>Concafum est contra
Manichaeos</HI>: The other fell gazing up∣on the Queen, and the King asking 
<PB N="367" REF="406"/> him how he lik'd her, <HI>Oh Sir,</HI> says he, <HI>if
an earthly Queen be so beautiful, what shall we think of the Queen of
Heaven.</HI> This latter was esteem'd the better Courtier. But from hence we
may infer, That the learnedst Men are not always the civillest and best
moral Men. And there is too great a Number of them, who lead a soft
sedentary Life, feeding only their own Fancies upon the Publick, and
therefore it were to be wished, that the <HI>English</HI> had not so
ge∣neral an itching after Book Learning</P>
<P>I well remember to have known a Person of Honour and great Quality
in <HI>England</HI> to have had three Sons by the same Lady, but of the
most different Genius's and Contrariety of Humours, that have been ever
seen; the eldest the most fantastical, proudest and foolishest in
all his Actions; the Second the most learned, sober, and yet bigotted in
De∣votion; the Third the most dissolute and drunken that could be seen,
but yet very witty in Conversation; inso∣much that there could not be found
a more pregnant Instance to prove that humane Souls come not
<HI>extraduce,</HI> and by seminal Production from their Parents.</P>

<P><PB N="369" REF="408"/>Religion and Justice are the two Sup∣porters
of every Commonwealth, they are the Pillars of all Government, with∣out them
the whole State, Civil and Ec∣clesiastical, will like a melted Vessel
run into Confusion and Disorder. The Law of a Nation is the Soul of a
Nati∣on; 'tis the Rudder, by which the Vessel of the Common-wealth is
steer'd, 'tis the Yoke wherewith All are kept in Obedience; and that
Common-Wealth, where Men, and not Laws govern, will be quickly like the Field
of the Sluggard, all grown over with Thorns and Nettles; and therefore there
had need be Weeders, that is, good Magi∣strates, to keep the Field of a
Common-Wealth, from being overspread with Thorns and Nettles, that is,
disorder∣ly lewd Persons, and they had need be good Laws that must keep
in such un∣ruly Beasts, the Disturbers of the Peace. To what Purpose do
Laws enjoin Pu∣nishments, if they are not put in Exe∣cution. For Laws must
not be like Cob∣webs, to catch only small Flies and to be broken by great
Ones; it were bet∣ter not to make any, for this makes eve∣ry particular Man's
Offence the Sin of the Publick, <HI>quis non vetat peccare cum potest,
jubet,</HI> to omit the Punishment <PB N="370" REF="409"/> of an Offence under
our Charge is to commit it. The due Observation of the Laws of God, and the
careful Ex∣ecution of the Laws of Men, make a Na∣tion flourish. They are
indeed the ve∣ry Spirit and Sinews of every State, for all Humane Laws have
their Depen∣dance upon the Laws of God, who is the Great Law-Giver, and the
nearer our Copies draw to that Original, the better they are, and the more like
to continue: <HI>In pessimâ republicâ leges plurimae.</HI> And
therefore the Curse of the Prophet hath been expounded by the Multitude of
penal Laws, which are worse than Showers of Hail and Tempest upon the
Cattle, for they fall upon Men; and where Religion and Laws are not
preserved, we can't pro∣perly call them Common-Wealths, but <HI>magna
latrocinia,</HI> great Confederacies of Thieves; if Religion be not upheld, if
the Laws be not observed, if Vice goes unpunished, and Virtue unrewarded,
if a due Respect be not given to Magi∣strates, who are the living Stamps of
the supreme Authority, all our Happi∣ness and Contentment in this Life and
the next will be taken away, and the whole Frame of Government will fall 
<PB N="371" REF="410"/> to the Ground and dissolve. The Ru∣lers of the Earth
belong unto God, and from hence we should learn our Duty of Honour, Reverence
and Loyalty. They were the Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> that de∣spised
<HI>Saul.</HI> Without Governours or Go∣vernment, one Man will be Bread for
another; and we should be as the Fi∣shes in the Sea, the Great would
de∣vour the Small. It is no particular Con∣ceit, but a great Truth, that all
Duties are by so much the better performed, by how much the Men are more
reli∣gious from whose Abilities the same proceed. But if Magistrates, who
are employed about the Publick Admini∣stration of Justice, follow it only
as a Trade for Gains sake, the Formalities of it will only then serve to
smother Right, and what was necessarily ordain∣ed for the common Good,
will thro' the Abuse of it be the Cause of com∣mon Misery. The Laws
without Exe∣cution, is putting Arrows into a Quiver from whence they are not
drawn out, this is to make the Magistrate an im∣moveable Statue, a

The Law without Execution is a <HI>Chimera,</HI> which only serves to

<P><PB N="372" REF="411"/>Justice and Fortune are painted blind, to
shew us what the one should do, and what the other should not do; for the
one gives without Respect, and the o∣ther is in no Respect to take; for

blind from respect∣ing Persons, and whose Hands are clo∣sed from
accepting Rewards. The <HI>Thebans</HI> painted their Judges and Ma∣gistrates
without Hands, since when their Hands are over long, 'tis to be feared their
Feet will become Gouty, their Tongue ty'd, their Ears deafened, and their Eyes

Law, and that his good Example should be a lively and perpetual Promulgation
of that Law; for Example prevails much more than Precept, and reduces more
under its Yoke, tho' naked, than the Law with all its Enforcements; and the
Reason is obvious, for the Arms of Law only strike the Body, but the Shafts
of Example strike into the Soul, and we see Men daily trust more to their
Eyes than to their Ears, more to <PB N="373" REF="412"/> what they see than to

Common-Wealth. The Justice every Man owes to him∣self, does oblige him
first to regulate his own Affections and Passions, and then he will be
more capable to ren∣der Justice to others, for both natural and divine Laws,
do propose our selves for a Rule and Measure of what we owe to our
Neighbours. Magistrates are to give good Examples to others, owing it
them∣selves for ordering their own Lives, and they owe to it the Publick for
Imitation. The just and good Man is a Rule and Measure of all others,
since being what all Men ought to be, he shews what all Men ought to do.
Integrity is so necessary in a Magistrate, that without it all other
Qualities are but Instruments of particular Profit, and Publick Loss. All
the <HI>Grecian</HI> Common-Wealths fell to Ruin for want of this. Gold breeds

Strength of my Mind is still in being, which with God's <PB N="377" REF="416"/> Blessing I hope to keep in Repair so long as my Body lasts,
and have there∣fore presum'd in this following Dis∣course, to shew
some Advantages of Old Age, of which I am at present a living Testimony,
even in this Year 1706.</P>
<P>The Life of Man is usually divided into Childhood, Youth, Man's
Estate, and Old Age, all which Degrees we bring into that narrow Compass,
whilst our Life consumes insensibly. Infancy is only a State of Hope,
and most com∣monly supported by the indulgent Ten∣derness of Parents and
Nurses. Youth, if well Educated, will soon blossom, and after yield
Fruit. Man's Estate, like a Flame, well kindled and supply'd will burn
long, but Old Age does usually soon pass away; and if we do not watch, we
lose our Opportunities; if we do not make haste we are left behind, our
best Hours fly from us, the worst are to come; the purest Part of our
Life runs first, and leaves only the Dregs at the Bottom, unless we take
great Care, and then our Strength and Desires will fall off together, and our
Years will sit easie upon us, when we're thus satisfy'd and compos'd; it
smooths our Passage <PB N="378" REF="417"/> to the other World, and makes
us slide into the Grave with a more gentle and insensible Motion. Indeed
if we could observe the State of our Infancy, when we came first into the
World, with the Progress of our Growth, and the Be∣ginning of our Reason,
it would certainly be a pleasant Retrospection, but divine Providence hath
hid this from our Sight. At our Birth neither our Limbs nor Understanding
were born at their full Growth, but we encrease by Degrees, and being Infants
in our Bodies, we are not Men in our Souls: The first ten Years we may call
an Animal Life, the Powers of Reason are then feeble in us, and we do but
sleep that Time away, but afterwards the Advances of Age are very gradual;
but yet this Gradation is so slow, that we cannot take much No∣tice of it,
nor see it with our Eyes, and so we think all goes well, since we are not
thrown so suddenly out of our Youth into our Manhood, and from that into
Old Age, which would be much more sensible to us, and concerns us more: But
we walk gently up Hill from our Youth to our middle State, and as gently down
the Hill from our Man∣hood into Old Age, without perceiv∣ing 
<PB N="379" REF="418"/> the Change we have made 'till we come at the Bottom:
However we must needs be troubled, when we con∣sider the greatest Part of
Life is no bet∣ter than a slow Consumption, and that at last we must
fall into a State of Weak∣ness, and be unacceptable both to o∣thers and to
our selves: But we sel∣dom think of this, because we seem to be the
same Men in the Morning, as we were the Night before. Now he that would have
his Health hold out to the last, and grow old with Advantage, must be
regular in his Youth, and not live too fast: We must husband our
Constituti∣on, and not throw it away 'till we have done living, for our Vices
destroy our Lives as well as our Fortunes; Intem∣perance antidates our
Infirmities, and makes us die much sooner than we should; and tho' we have
the World be∣fore us, we do not play the good Hus∣band early enough; for 'tis
too late to spare at the Bottom, when all is drawn out to the Lees. 'Tis
true, we old Men cannot but be something con∣cerned, to think that we grow
less and less every Day, doing the same things over again; and that we
live only to nurse up our Decays, which is trou∣blesome 
<PB N="380" REF="419"/> to us, especially since there is nothing in this
World to make us in love with it, or fond of it; none yet were ever fully
pleas'd with it; for tho' it seems a <HI>Juno</HI> in the Pursuit, 'tis but
a Cloud in our Embraces; and there∣fore those who are sorry to see their
Voyage fixed, are over-fond of their native Country, and hang about Life a
little too meanly. Indeed when our Senses droop, and all the Faculties of our
Souls and Bodies decay apace, it is then high time to bid adieu to the active
Life, and not only to abandon the Vanities of this fading World, but the very
Remembrance and Thoughts of them: Our Minds begin then to be nauseated with
the Ideas of our past Folly, which we falsly call'd Pleasure; and that
Retrospect is unpleasant, when we re∣flect upon a Life to be repented of.
It is but Reason when we approach near the Grave, when all our Senses put
us daily in Mind of our Mortality, that we should begin to recollect our
selves, and think whereabouts we are, that we may not be surpriz'd, and die
less than our selves. It should be our Care be∣fore we grow old to live
well, and then we may be sure to die well. It is the <PB N="381" REF="420"/>
Duty of Life to prepare our selves for Death; there is not one Hour we live,
that does not mind us of our Mortality. Time runs on, the Period is certain,
tho' it lyes in the Dark, our Term is set, and none of us know how near it
is, and therefore we should not won∣der to have that befall us to Day, which
might have happened to us any Minute since we were born. This
Con∣sideration should make us live as if e∣very Minute were our last. But
we fear Death, only because we know not where we shall go, and we never
begin to reform 'till our old Age, after ha∣ving spent our former Years in
all Sorts of Vanity (which is better late than never) but 'tis a miserable
Case, not to know the Value of a Treasure, 'till we are going to lose it.
To begin our Frugality, when we are ready to turn Bankrupts: We should
therefore begin early to do that which will al∣ways please, and young Men
should carefully avoid throwing away their Time, as if they came into the
World for no other End but to eat and sleep, or else to spend their Days
in Wan∣tonness and Folly, and to make Vice <PB N="382" REF="421"/> their
Business. Thus we see in gene∣ral, that Age grows worse upon the
Pro∣gress, and hath no Relief to expect but the Grave; yet in some, Health,
Vigour and Sense, hold out to the last. Many of the ancient Philosophers
and <HI>Romans</HI> were Examples of this Truth. <HI>Tully,</HI> who wrote
excellently well <HI>de Senectute</HI> was a lively Example hereof, being
past Sixty when he wrote his <HI>Philippicks,</HI> in which his Rheto∣rick is
more correct and moving than in his younger Orations. The Poe∣tick Fire, which
is usually soonest ex∣tinct in Men, I have found by Expe∣rience in my
self, hath lasted much beyond that Period, of which I could give modern
Proof, but I will leave that to my Son; only this I can with Truth affirm, that
the Poems I have made since my Age of Seventy, have more of Force and Spirit,
than those I had written some Years before; but this is a particular Grace
of God, it being very unusual in the Generality, and ve∣ry hard for Men to
seem young when they're old, and much more strange to be so; for tho' at
ones Death, <HI>Fuimus</HI> may make a good Motto, yet in Life 'tis stark
naught.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="422"/>None can imagine how green and vigorous some
Mens Minds are in Old Age, having a perpetual Conflict with their Bodies, who
were ill-match'd, unless to shew that an active Spirit may be lodged in a
decay'd Body. It is certainly a particular Happiness to preserve the Force
of the Mind in the Decay of the Body, to live to that Age, that neither cares
for any thing, nor stands in need of any thing; that tho' it can much longer,
yet it will not still do the same Things over again, which it ought not to
do, Age ha∣ving put an End to his Desires; cer∣tainly there can be no gentler
End, than thus to melt away in a kind of Dissolution.</P>
<P>Where Fire meets with Opposition and Matter to work upon, it is
furi∣ous and rages, but when it finds no Fuel, as in Old Age, it goes out
quick∣ly for want of Nourishment; nor is the Body the settled Habitation of
the Soul, but a temporary Lodging, which we must leave whenever the Master
of the House pleases. 'Tis true, every Man hath naturally a Love for his
own Body, as poor People love even their own beggarly Cottages: They are 
<PB N="384" REF="423"/> old Acquaintances, and loath to part; yet old Men, tho'
they may some∣what indulge their Bodies, yet they make not themselves
Slaves to them, nor care any more what becomes of their Carkasses, when
dead, than a Man does for the shaving of his Beard under the Hand of a
Barber. How∣ever Age it self is not without its Pleasures, if we knew
rightly how to use them (the best Morsel being still reserved for the
last) or almost it is equivalent to the enjoying of Plea∣sures, not to
stand in need of them. Time indeed goes faster with old Men than young,
because they rec∣kon most upon it. There is hardly any Man so old but he
may hope for one Day more yet, and the longest Life is but a Multiplication
of Days, nay Hours and Moments, for the End of our Lives is set, and the
first Breath we draw, is but the first Step to our last, the Course of
all Things in this World being only a long Connection of Providential
Appointments; and tho' there be great Variety in our Lives, yet all tend to the
same Is∣sue. Death old Men find most easie, because it is comply'd
with without <PB N="385" REF="424"/> strugling; for by dying of old Age, a Man
does no more than go to Bed when he is weary, it being childish to go out of
the World as we came into it, groan∣ing and crying. For these and many other
Reasons, I cannot agree with them that seem to impute much Inconveni∣ence
to long Life, and that length of Days does much rather impair than im∣prove us;
for if we follow the Course of Nature and of Reason, old Age is a mighty
Blessing, were it only in re∣gard that it gives Time leave to vent and boil
away the Unquietness and Turbulency that follow our Pas∣sions in our
younger Years, and weans us gently from carnal Affections, and at last to
drop with Ease and Willing∣ness, like ripe Fruit from the Tree; for when
before the Season Fruit is pull'd off with violent Hands, or shaken down by
rude and boisterous Winds, it hath an indigested raw taste of the Wood,
and hath an unpleasant Eagerness in its Juice, that makes it unfit for
Use till length of time hath mellowed it; so Souls that go out of their
Bodies with Affection to those Objects they leave behind (which usually is
as long as they can relish them) do retain still, as some 
<PB N="386" REF="425"/> think, even to their Separation, a By∣ass and
Languishing toward them. Be∣sides, we must consider that old Age is not
always a Burthen and Incum∣brance, there are several peculiar Pri∣vileges
annexed to this part of Life which will relieve us under the Decays of the
Body; for the Imperfections of old Age are not so unavoidable as grey Hairs.
The quiet Composure of an old Man's Mind, keeps him from wearing out so
fast, it props up his Strength, and makes him live cheer∣fully to the last
Moment; for easie Thoughts are excellent Opiates, which will not only
mitigate old Men's Di∣stemper, but make them almost to despise their
Misery. Thus most Men take Care to live long, but few take Care to live
well, which is in every Man's Power to do, but in no Man's Power to do the
former.</P>
<P>We consume our Lives in providing the very Instruments of Life,
so that we do not properly live but we are about to live, and we only
propound to begin to live at our old Age, to which very few People arrive.</P>
<P>There are other very remarkable Advantages of old Age; for those 
<PB N="387" REF="426"/> who have had the longest Time to im∣prove themselves
must needs be the wisest Men; such have seen greater Va∣riety of
Events, have had more Oppor∣tunities of observing Humours and In∣terests:
Their Judgments are more ex∣act, they know more things and those better than
young Men, bringing their Thoughts to a second Test, for trying what they
took upon Trust in their Youth. Old Men are usually free from violent
Passions; matters of Moment are better consider'd by them; whereas
younger Persons are apt to judge amiss, their Prospect being too short;
and certainly Age is the time in which the Mind is most discerning, and
furnisht with the best Materials for Wisdom: Those who have been
longest in publick Employments, whose Performances have been more than
ordi∣nary, who have done most Service for their King and Country, deserve
cer∣tainly a more particular Respect, and should be considered with more
Re∣gards, and should have the fairest Ac∣knowledgments, and treated with
the best Civility, like parting Friends that are ready to take leave of the
World; but, alas! this seldom happens, for old <PB N="388" REF="427"/>
Services are usually forgotten, especi∣ally in an Age where young Men see
Visions, and old Men Dream, their former Actions and repeated good Ser∣vices
being no more taken notice of, than if they had never been, tho' even Decency
and Good-Nature should at least make them be respected for them.</P>
<P>Thus the State of Mortals in this Life is very changeable; if we are
in∣vited to cast Anchor awhile in some calm, serene Season, if we are
permit∣ted to Careen and Recruit our Wea∣ther-beaten Spirits, enjoying some
short interval of Rest and Ease, the Indul∣gence soon expires, and we
are forced to hoist Sail with double Diligence, least we suffer a Wreck,
for we fly at Random in a Sea of perpetual Hazards and Difficulties; and yet
the shortness of Life is the common Complaint of most People, who make it
short either by doing ill, doing nothing, or doing Things besides their
Business; so that this large extent of Life will not per∣haps amount to
the Minority of Man; so that it may be a long Being, perhaps a short Life;
for it is not the Num∣ber of Years that makes Death easie to 
<PB N="389" REF="428"/> us, but the Temper of the Mind; he that would live a
little longer this Day, would be as loth to Die a thousand Years hence: Go we
must at last, no matter how soon: 'Tis the Work of the Al∣mighty to make
us live long, but 'tis own Business to make a short Life suf∣ficient.
Life is to be measur'd by our Actions, not by Time. A Man may die old at
Thirty, and young at Eighty, the one lives after Death, the other pe∣rished
before he died. And therefore that Noble General <HI>Similis,</HI> who lived to
a great Age, and retired from Busi∣ness to his Devotion Seven Years before
his Death, would have only this Epi∣taph in Substance engrav'd upon his
Tomb-stone: <HI>Here lies</HI> Similis <HI>of a ve∣ry great Age, and yet
lived only Seven Years.</HI></P>
<P>Old Age is the Effect of Providence: How long I shall live is only
in God's Power, but it's in my Power how well. How great a shame is it then
to be lay∣ing new Foundations of Life at our last Gasp? for an old Man,
with one Foot in the Grave, to go to School again? While we are young we may
learn, be∣cause our Minds are then tractable, and our Bodies fit for Labour;
but <PB N="390" REF="429"/> when old Age comes on, we are com∣monly seiz'd
with Sloath and afflicted with Diseases, and at last we leave the World
as Ignorant as we came into it; only we die worse than we were born, which is
our own Fault. I wish with all my Soul that I had thought better and sooner
of my End; but I must now make the more haste, and being in good Health, I
must Spur on, like those that set out late upon a Journey: It is better
to learn late, than not at all, altho' it be only to instruct me how I may
leave the Stage of this World, with a perfect Resignation, with a true
Sense of the Sins of my fore-passed Life, with a true Fear of God, and a
sure Trust in his Mercy; and thus I shall sink with Ease into my
Grave, and tho' I die old, I shall rise young in the other World, for that
State is an eternal Spring, ever flourishing, and shall gently pass from
one Extream to another.</P>
