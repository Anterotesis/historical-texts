<P>THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH BIRDS; OR, A SELECTION OF THE MOST RARE, BEAUTIFUL, AND INTERESTING BIRDS WHICH INHABIT THIS COUNTRY: THE DESCRIPTIONS FROM THE <HI>SYSTEMA NATURAE</HI> OF LINNAEUS; WITH GENERAL OBSERVATIONS, EITHER ORIGINAL, OR COLLECTED FROM THE LATEST AND MOST ESTEEMED <HI>ENGLISH ORNITHOLOGISTS;</HI> AND ILLUSTRATED WITH FIGURES, DRAWN, ENGRAVED, AND COLOURED FROM FINE AND LIVING SPECIMENS.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Work being now completed, we conceive our engagement with the Subscribers, is, in every respect fulfilled, and that it only remains to embrace this opportunity, to repeat our thanks for their favours; and in particular, for the candour with which the Supplementary Part has been received.</P>
<P>But, in submitting the work to the Public in general, as an illustration of an important branch of British Zoology, it is incumbent on us, to state briefly, the nature, and extent of the undertaking, the information it contains, and its peculiar advantages. In this retrospective survey of the work, we must advert to our former observations; some similar re∣marks appeared at the conclusion of the fourth volume, and we retrace those, as they immediately relate to the outline of our design.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>Ornithology, as a science, has undergone various altera∣tions and improvements: different authors have submitted their systems to the world, and each has found its admirers and opponents; nor has the unrivalled genius of Linnaeus devised an arrangement in which those opposite opinions may be reconciled. On the importance of Ornithology, in the great scale of animated nature, no difference of opinion can prevail. The beauty and elegance of the feathered race: their pleasing and various melody; their sagacity, and trac∣table manners, has been admired in every age and country; and their unerring oeconomy and instinct, has ever engaged the attention of the moral philosopher. The Birds of this country are of plainer colours than those of warmer climates, but they are not less interesting to the English naturalist. If, in some instances, their beauty has little claim to our no∣tice; in others it excites our admiration; and to the intelli∣gent mind, their beauty, their singularities, peculiar manners, and oeconomy are equally engaging. They are the source of information and improvement to the practical Ornithologist, and of rational and agreeable amusement to every common observer of nature.</P>
<P>At the commencement of this work, it was our intention to form a complete History of British Ornithology, and to include figures of all the known Birds, amounting to more than two hundred and fifty species; but we have since con∣ceived it would be advisable to select only the more beau∣tiful
<PB REF="5"/>
Birds, in addition to those which are interesting to the naturalist: for a considerable number of the British species are so well known, that their history would be tedious, and the figures unnecessary, in a work professedly designed to treat of the most remarkable species only. Not that we have entirely overlooked the common Birds; in several in∣stances some of these are introduced also, to point out their singular habits of life, and other interesting peculiarities; but, in general, we have endeavoured to form an instructive as well as amusing illustration of this department of Natural History.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be contended, that a complete collection of figures and descriptions of all the British Birds, would be more acceptable than any partial selection, however com∣prehensive. We admit the propriety of this objection; but must observe, that such addition would considerably increase the expense to the purchaser, and scarcely contri∣bute to his information. On the other hand, this work, in its present limits, may assist the researches of the uninformed naturalist, and tend to promote a deeper and more extensive enquiry into this branch of science. It embraces in one view the whole of those British Birds that are scarcely known, and of which the inquisitive reader, under many circum∣stances, may be desirous of information. We have omitted many of those Birds which constantly inhabit this country; but have included all local species, and in particular, those,
<PB REF="6"/>
whose haunts and breeding places are difficult of access, and the Birds in consequence, little known. The extensive marshes and lowlands in some parts of the kingdom, are the retreats and breeding places of certain species. Those solitary kinds, which retire to the depths, and gloomy re∣cesses of forests, are rarely observed; and many of those which seek the open plain for security, elude our vigilance, and are not better known. But the rarest of the local kinds, are of the rapacious and gallinaceous tribes, which never leave their dreary solitudes: their wilds and barren moun∣tains in the north; to visit the southern parts of Great Bri∣tain. The migratory Birds are numerous, and include many well known species, with others that are uncommonly scarce. We have taken an extensive variety of the beautiful Land Birds, that resort to this country occasionally from the south of Europe; and of the aquatic or web-footed tribe, that are driven by the severity of the winter in the Arctic regions to seek shelter on our shores. History and tradition inform us of other Birds that formerly inhabited these king∣doms, but are now extirpated; and these form an interesting sequel to this selection. We cannot vindicate the pro∣priety of introducing naturalized exotic species amongst these, though they are arranged by our Naturalists in the British Ornithology; and in some instances we have fol∣lowed their authority, for the sake of embellishment and variety.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>In the course of publication, we have been fortunate in procuring specimens of many uncommon Birds. Among the most remarkable, are <HI>The Rose-coloured Ouzel, Roller, Little Bittern, Waxen Chatterer, Black Woodpecker,</HI> and in particular that rare and almost unknown species, the <HI>Wood Chat.—The Red-necked Grebe, Dartford Warbler, Dusky Lark, Long-legged Plover, Egret</HI> and <HI>Cock of the Wood.</HI> We could enumerate many other species highly important to the uninformed naturalist; but, we refer our readers for the general detail, to the complete Systematic Arrangement an∣nexed to this Advertisement.</P>
<P>In this Systematic Arrangement we have followed the <HI>Systema Naturae</HI> of Linnaeus, though we totally dissent from the opinion of that celebrated naturalist in his primary divisions of Ornithology. In every system, the Birds which inhabit the land only, are separated from such as frequent the water. This appears to be a natural method of forming two principal divisions of Ornithology; it was adopted by Ray, and approved by Pennant and Latham. In the Linnaean system, those which inhabit the water are separated from the rest; but the Land Birds are divided into two parts, and the Water Birds are placed between them. To avoid con∣fusion we have adhered to this arrangement; but we have also placed an Index, in the manner of Pennant and Latham, at the conclusion of each volume.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>Having endeavoured to explain the nature and extent of this undertaking, we submit the whole to the candour of the Public; and, though not indifferent to the flattering testimony of approbation, it has received in the course of five years publication, we entreat indulgence for whatever may be thought exceptionable, either in the outline of our under∣taking, the selection of species, or the manner in which they are illustrated. To our Subscribers, we shall not presume to address any apology, as their opinion must be already decided. The progressive manner in which the work has appeared, has afforded every opportunity for cri∣tical examination, for detecting error, or discovering merit; and, we trust, their continued patronage is some criterion of their approbation, and of the general utility of our design.</P>

<P>The Great Titmouse, Colemouse, and Marsh Titmouse; with the Blue, Long-tailed, and Bearded, Titmice, are the only species of the tribe which inhabit this country: they are all very frequent ex∣cepting the latter; which however is not uncommon in certain situa∣tions, though formerly esteemed as rare.</P>
<P>It was described by <HI>Aldrovandus</HI> in his Ornithology published in the years 1610—1613; and appears to be well known at that time in se∣veral parts of Europe, though unknown in Britain: more than a cen∣tury after <HI>Aldrovandus,</HI> (1734), it was included in a History of the Birds of Germany by <HI>J. L. Frisch;</HI> but even at that time, was so rare with us, that it was scarcely ascertained to be a native of Britain; and Albin, who seems to have possessed some knowledge of Birds, de∣termines it as a native, only on the authority of the information he received from others; his History of Birds was published in 1738; therein he gives a figure of the Male Bird, and says in the Descriptions annexed, "These two birds (male and female) I bought of Mr. <HI>Bland</HI> on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> who told me he had them from <HI>Jutland:</HI> I have been since informed by Sir <HI>Robert Abdy,</HI> that they are found in the <HI>Salt∣marshes</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> and by others that they are likewise in the fens in <HI>Lincolnshire."</HI></P>
<P>He also observes that it receives the name Beardmanica from the black tuft resembling a picked beard.</P>
<P>Edwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">G. Edwards's Nat. Hist. of Birds, Vol. 7. 4 to. London, 1743, &amp;c.</NOTE> refers it to the tribe of Butcher-birds, under the title of LANIUS <HI>Minimus,</HI> Least Butcher-Bird; but Linnaeus, in his <HI>Systema Naturae,</HI> reduced it to the PARUS genus; and late writers have also determined it to the same family.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="23"/>Its length, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, is six inches and a quarter: the bill is thick, and of a bright yellow colour, but fades immediately when the bird dies; in the female it is rather dusky; and the head, which is of a fine grey in the male, is of a brownish rust colour, spotted with black, in the female: indeed, the female is immediately distinguished by the plainness of her plumage, it neither possessing the beautiful purple colour on the breast, or the black tufts on the throat, which characterizes the male: the vent-feathers of the male are pale black; of the female light brown; as are the other parts of the belly.</P>
<P>Pennant, in the British Zoology, says, "This species is found in the marshes near <HI>London:</HI> we have seen it near <HI>Gloucester:</HI> it is also frequent among the great tracts of reeds near <HI>Cowbit</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where I suspect they breed.</P>
<P>Latham, in his General Synopsis,—"These birds are found in England, but have hitherto been observed only in marshy situations where <HI>reeds</HI> grow, on the seeds of which it feeds, as well as small in∣sects; both of which have been found in their stomachs. They are pretty frequent, and in not inconsiderable quantities, in the marshes among the reeds between <HI>Erith</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> and are again met with in such-like places near <HI>Gloucester,</HI> as well as among the great tracts of reeds near <HI>Cowbit,</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI> In all these places I make no doubt of their breeding, as I know that they stay in the first-named parts the whole year. The nest is not known for certain; but I have seen one, which was composed of very soft downy materials, suspended between three reeds drawn together, thought to be the work of that bird."</P>
<P>"They are also common in <HI>Denmark;</HI> and <HI>Buffon</HI> supposes that a pair of these, having escaped from the cage of the <HI>Countess</HI> of <HI>Albe∣marle,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>
have founded this colony in England. This may have been the case in respect to those of <HI>Erith,</HI> being on the borders of the <HI>Thames,</HI> but will not so well account for their being elsewhere; and I am inclined to think that they are indigenous to us, and have been so <HI>ab origine;</HI> and that it is merely owing to their frequenting such places only where the <HI>reeds</HI> grow, that they have been so little known; for as those birds never go farther than a few yards from the <HI>beds</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The <HI>reed-beds</HI> frequently cover many acres of ground; these grow in the water, so as to be overflowed at every tide; and few persons ever go near them, except in the time of cutting, which they do in boats, as, except at very low tides, one can scarce set a footstep within their boundaries."</NOTE>, they have stood a greater chance, which has really happened, of not being earlier observed."</P>
<P><HI>Kramer</HI> says the nest is built among the <HI>willows,</HI> and is of the shape of a purse, made of soft downy materials, such as the down of the <HI>Greater Cat's-Tail</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Typha latifolia.</HI> Lin.</NOTE>, or that of the <HI>Asp</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Populus tremula.</HI> Lin.</NOTE>, hanging the nest on a branch.</P>
<P>What new light Mr. Latham could throw on this subject, is given in the <HI>Supplement</HI> published in the year 1787.</P>
<P>"I have never yet been able myself to ascertain the nest and eggs. In <HI>Sepp</HI>'s <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sepp. V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g.</HI> pl. in p. 83.</NOTE> plate the nest is placed on the <HI>ground</HI> among the <HI>sedges.</HI> It is of a very loose texture, composed of the tops of dry grass, mixed with the seed-heads of <HI>rushes</HI> and <HI>reeds,</HI> with narrow leaves inter∣mixed. The eggs four in number, of a reddish white, marked with small brown spots."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="25"/>"This species is found in <HI>Schonen,</HI> in Sweden; but rarely.

<P>The male shews much tenderness and care for its young, and its mate partakes also of its affection: it is said to be ever constant in its attachments; and at night, when at roost, the male protects the fe∣male, under the concave of his wing.</P>

<P>The Jay, though very frequent in every part of the country, evi∣dently deserves, for the singular beauty of its plumage, the first place in a collection of interesting British Birds: it is a species, however, not merely confined to this kingdom; but generally diffused over the greater part of the continent of Europe.</P>
<P>Among the foreign birds which are referred to this genus, are se∣veral species eminently distinguished for their rich and elegant colour∣ing; but the European Jay is certainly superior in this particular to many exotics of the same family.</P>
<P>Its habits are known, in a great degree, to resemble those of the Magpie, which also belongs to the same genus. It will devour with avidity cherries, gooseberries, raspberries, or other fruits; but in au∣tumn and winter it feeds on acorns; whence it long since derived the name PICA <HI>Glandaria.</HI> It is not destitute of a carnivorous ap∣petite, as it frequently combats, and devours, small birds: it also feeds on worms and insects.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="29"/>Ablin, in Plate 16. Vol. 1. very accurately describes the Jay he took his figure from, which nearly corresponds with our specimen.</P>
<P>"Its length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, was fourteen inches; its breadth, when the wings were extended, twenty-one inches and an half; its weight seven ounces; the bill dark ash co∣lour inclining to black, strong, near an inch and an half long; the tongue black, thin, pellucid, and cloven at the tip; the irides of the eyes white. Near on the lower chap of the bill are two black spots, on each side one. The chin and lower part of the belly whitish, else the breast and belly are of a mixt cinereous and red; the rump above is white, the back red, with a mixture of blue; the feathers on the crown of the head variegated with black and white.</P>
<P>"The sails of the wings are in number twenty, of which the first is shorter by half than the second, the fourth the longest (being by mea∣sure six inches and a quarter); the first or outermost is black, the bottom or lower part white, which is proper to it alone; the six next following have their exterior vanes of an ash colour, the three next likewise, but more obscure, and mingled with blue, being also marked toward their bottom with transverse black and white strokes; the five succeeding have their exterior vanes half white, half black, viz. the lower half white, the upper black, but so that each extremity of the white is terminated with blue; the sixteenth, in place of the white of the four precedent, hath transverse blue, black, and white spots; the seventeenth is black, having one or two blue spots; the eighteenth is black with some little red; the nineteenth red with the tip black; the under sides of all the feathers of the wing are of a dark or dusky colour; the covert-feathers of the fifteen exterior sails are very beautiful, being variegated or chequered with black, white, and lovely shining blue lines, the rest of the covert-feathers being black.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="30"/>"The tail is six inches and a quarter long, consisting of twelve feathers, wholly black except toward their roots: under the rump there is something of a blue mingled with cinereous.</P>
<P>"The feet and toes are of a ferruginous dusky colour, the middle toe is the longest; the outmost is equal to the back toe; the lower joint of the outmost toe is joined to the middlemost; the back claw is the greatest.</P>
<P>"The guts are twenty-four inches long; the blind guts but half an inch; it hath a gall and a long spleen: the stomach or gizzard not very fleshy, and having its echinus, wherein were found acorns, &amp;c."</P>
<P>He adds, "The female differs little or nothing from the male, either in bigness or colour, so that it is very difficult to know them asunder:" but after the publication of his first Volume of Birds, he rectifies this error, in a supplement which is prefixed to the work. "The following observations," (says he) "I received from Dr. Der∣ham, after the descriptions were printed. He hath observed the Cock Jay (Plate 16. Vol. 1.) to be somewhat bigger than the Hen, the feathers on the head to be blacker, the stripes longer, and the black and blue colours more elegant in the Cock than in the Hen."</P>
<P>Jays generally build in woods, preferring a situation near the skirts: the nest is composed of fibrous roots, and young twigs, erected on a base of several large sticks, and is placed on the top of a thorn-bush, or other under-wood, or between the first branches of low decayed trees: the female lays five or six eggs, of the size of a pigeon's, of a cinereous olive colour, marked with very pale brown spots: the young Jays remain with their parents till the next spring; and at the pairing time they each choose his mate, to propagate their future progeny.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="31"/>It is a restless and very quarrelsome bird: makes a harsh, chattering and screaming noise; and is ever at variance not only with its own species, but with every other inhabitant of the forest: when deprived of liberty, it may be taught to imitate the human voice; but the ori∣ginal appearance of its plumage is so altered by confinement, as scarcely to retain any of the beautiful colours, which are so emi∣nently conspicuous in the wild state.</P>
<P>It is a native of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and of <HI>Russia;</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of <HI>England;</HI> but does not frequent the islands adjacent.</P>
<P>Latham says, "The Jay, I believe, is not spread so far as many others of the genus, as we do not hear of its inhabiting further south than <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>"This species is common in the woods both of <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Siberia,</HI> but none beyond the <HI>Lena</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arct. Zool.</NOTE>; <HI>Georgi</HI> mentions it as frequenting the Lake <HI>Baikal,</HI> and <HI>Russel</HI> records it as an <HI>Aleppo</HI> species <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Alepp. p. <HI>69</HI></NOTE>. I have a suspicion also that it extends to <HI>China,</HI> as it is to be seen in the drawings of birds from that country.</P>
<P>"It is called by the name of <HI>Jay,</HI> about <HI>Arragon</HI> in Spain, as in <HI>England.</HI> In the last it is not esteemed as food; but in the first it is exposed to sale along with other birds <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Faun.

<P>This species is very rare in every part of Europe; and especially in this country: we have a figure of it in the British Zoology; but unfor∣tunately, notwithstanding Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI>'s very laudable intentions, he had no opportunity of consulting the original specimen; he depended on a drawing done by his friend Mr. <HI>G. Edwards;</HI> and the copy is only a distant imitation of the bird; it is defective about the body, and ex∣ceedingly incorrect as to the circumference of the neck; the account says, "Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> discovered this beautiful bird twice in our island, near <HI>London,</HI> at <HI>Norwood,</HI> and another time in <HI>Norfolk;"</HI> the figure of this was copied by permission from his beautiful and accurate design, which we gratefully acknowledge, as well as every other assistance from our worthy friend; whose pencil has done so much honour to his country.</P>
<P>This bird is the size of a starling; eight inches in length: bill three quarters of an inch, of a flesh-colour, with the base reddish: irides pale: the feathers on the head long, they form a crest which impends on the neck: the head, neck, wings, and tail, are black; the two latter are strongly glossed with green; and in some parts with an inclination to blue and purple: the back, rump, breast, belly, and lesser wing coverts, pale rose colour, with a few irregular dark spots: legs pale red, or orange.</P>
<P>Russell in his History of Aleppo, calls our <HI>rese</HI> a <HI>flesh</HI>-colour; and in the Petersburgh Transactions the name given to it is <HI>sanguineous;</HI> we may then conclude that the bird varies much in its rose, or pink colour; the female also is paler than the male.</P>
<P>Mr. Latham has added a farther proof of its being found in this country, one was shot at <HI>Grantham,</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and is now in the possession of Sir Joseph Banks, Bart.; and he says that he is assured of one, or more, being shot almost every season about <HI>Ormskirk</HI> in <HI>Lan∣cashire.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="36"/>It is more frequent in <HI>France;</HI> and is met with in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in its passage to other parts: <HI>Aldrovandus</HI> mentions it as not uncommon in Italy, where it is called the sea stare, and says its usual haunts are among heaps of dung <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aldr. Av.</HI> II. 283.</NOTE>: it is also found in <HI>Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Lapland,</HI> but it never passes the limits of that frozen region <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Linnaeus.</HI>—Mr. <HI>Ekmarck.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In some parts of Asia it is common: "It comes in great numbers about <HI>Aleppo,</HI> in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> in pursuit of the swarms of <HI>locusts</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hence called the locust bird. <HI>Russell. Hist.

<P>The golden crested Wren is the smallest bird yet discovered, in either of the British isles; is common to <HI>France, Austria, Italy,</HI> and most other parts of Europe; and in those countries, as with us, it appears to be the least native species.</P>
<P>But discoveries in the interior parts of <HI>south America,</HI> have verified, that it is not the least kind existing; in that country where the Con∣dor is found, the most diminutive species of the feathered tribe are also taken; and to those the least European bird bears a gigantic dispropor∣tion; for instance, the length of the golden-crested Wren is three inches and an half, its weight seventy-six grains: but the total length of the least South-American Humming bird <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trochilus minimus <HI>Lin.

<P><PB REF="40"/>The appellations Regulus, and Tyrannus, Little King, or Tyrant, have been given to the golden-crested Wren by some authors: it has ability to conceal the orange band on the head; by corrugating the forehead, and drawing together the feathers, which form the black longitudinal band on each side.</P>
<P>The colour of the plumage of the female is paler, than of the male; the crest or feathers on the crown of the head are yellow, but without the bright orange colour, which softens into the crest of the male.</P>
<P>It remains with us through the winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Latham.</HI> IV. 509. 145.</NOTE>; frequents woods; and builds its nest, either in oak, fir, or yew trees, the nest is of a roundish form, with an opening on one side; it is composed of <HI>moss;</HI> and lined within with some downy substance, (perhaps cobwebs,) intermixed with small filaments.</P>
<P>It lays six or seven eggs, which are no bigger than large peas <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Albin Orn.</HI> 1. 51. 53.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Although the species is found in Europe, it is scattered throughout the other three quarters of the globe, with only some little variations which mark the influence of climate; Latham mentions a specimen received from <HI>Cayenne</HI> with black legs.</P>
<P>It is a native of <HI>Russia</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Georgi.</NOTE>, <HI>Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Norway;</HI> and is found as far north as the <HI>Shetland</HI> isles; but disappears before winter; it bears cold extremely well, and therefore it may be rather the scarcity of insects, on which it feeds; than merely the approaching season, which induces it to take such vast flights.</P>

This bird is very frequent in England, and is spread throughout the whole of the old Continent; <HI>Latham</HI> says he has more than once met with a representation of it in <HI>Chinese</HI> drawings: it extends as far as <HI>Iceland,</HI> the <HI>Feroe Isles,</HI> and <HI>Drontheim;</HI> it is common in <HI>Russia, Siberia,</HI> and <HI>Kamptschatka;</HI> but is not found in the more northern regions.</P>
<P>It also inhabits <HI>India,</HI> a drawing which was done on the spot being in the collection of Lady Impey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Latham Supp.</HI> Gen. Syn. 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It frequents the sides of pools and small rivulets; and feeds on insects: it is often seen running on the ground with much celerity, or leaping up after flies: the tail is frequently in motion. Birds of this genus seldom perch; fly in an undulating manner, and have a twitter∣ing noise in flight.</P>
<P><HI>Willughby</HI> observes, that this species shifts its quarters in the win∣ter; moving from the north to the south of England during that season.</P>
<P><HI>Latham</HI> suspects that part of them migrate, as he does not recollect seeing so many in winter, as in the summer season, and says, in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and in the north of England, it is scarce ever seen in hard weather.</P>
<P>This, and others of this class, are called, both by the French and English, <HI>Washer-Women,</HI> or <HI>Dish-Washers.</HI></P>
<P>It is particularly serviceable to the farmer in Spring and Autumn, by attending the plough to devour the larvae of insects, worms, &amp;c. which are turned up; hence it is the interest of the farmer to dis∣courage any attempt to destroy those birds, and to this circumstance they may owe much for their preservation.</P>
<P><PB REF="45"/>The marks and colours vary very considerably in different specimens. Some have only a crescent of black on the breast, the chin and throat being quite white, in others all the white parts are strongly tinctured with yellow; in some the chin, fore part of the neck, and breast, are black; and in the <HI>Leverian Museum</HI> is a fine variety; white, except the hind parts, which are yellowish.</P>
<P>In the <HI>females,</HI> the top of the head generally inclines to brown. The usual length of this species is seven inches from the bill to the extre∣mity of the tail.</P>
<P>The nest is built on the ground, is composed of dry grass, fine fibres, and moss; lined with hair, feathers, or soft dry grass; the eggs are five in number; white, spotted with brown: for the most part they have only one brood in a year.</P>

<P>Supposed to inhabit some parts of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway;</HI> has been discovered, though very rarely, near the <HI>Caspian Sea;</HI> and was once received by <HI>Mr. Pennant,</HI> from <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P>It is probably a scarce bird in every part; in this country it has been only discovered by a few individuals, and that very lately; we believe the most perfect yet taken, to be that specimen of which Mr. Latham has given a figure in the supplement to his General Synopsis; our figure is also copied from the same bird.</P>
<P>It is on the authority of this author, that we include it as a British bird; in his description he says, "I received a perfect specimen of the <HI>Male</HI> of this bird from Major <HI>Hammond,</HI> who informed me, that the end of April, the year 1786, two of them alighted in a farm-yard, near his house, in <HI>East Kent,</HI> and were taken alive."</P>
<P>"I have also met with two other specimens; the first sent to me <HI>January</HI> 28, 1786, by <HI>Mr. Martin,</HI> of <HI>Teignmouth,</HI> a gentleman to whom I owe many other obligations: his specimen had not come to perfection, as the colours on the head and neck were much blended, and the ferruginous on the neck only just breaking forth. <HI>Mr. Boys,</HI> of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> also obliged me with a third, the beginning of last <HI>October,</HI> (1787): his bird, he informed me, weighed nineteen ounces and a half; the length twenty-one inches and a half; breadth eight. The bill yellow at the base, dusky olive towards the tip: lore dusky: irides pale brown: head quite smooth. The description differed not much; but the ferruginous colour of the neck was much blended with dusky; the white on the under parts greatly mottled with the same: Legs dusky; within, greenish yellow. The middle toe united to the
<PB REF="49"/>
inner as far as the first joint; and to the outer, to the middle of the second <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This species was unknown to Linnaeus, but according to his definition,evidently belongs to the genus COLYMBUS: <HI>Latham</HI> observes, that Linnaeus has erroneously included the <HI>Grebes, Divers,</HI> and <HI>Guillemots</HI> into that genus without even a division, though they very materially differ from one another; especially in the legs: those of the <HI>Grebes</HI> are not webbed; the <HI>Guillemots,</HI> though web-footed, have only three toes, all placed forwards; and the <HI>Divers</HI> have three toes before, and one behind.</P>
<P>He therefore thinks that they should be separated; and as the form of the feet of this species appears to prevail throughout the genus, recommends its being included with the other parts of its essential character; he has named his new genus PODICEPS.</P>
<P>Pennant has also submitted to a division of the Linnaean <HI>genus.</HI> "The <HI>Grebes</HI> and <HI>Divers</HI> are placed in the same genus, <HI>i. e.</HI> of <HI>Colymbi,</HI> by <HI>Mr. Ray</HI> and <HI>Linnaeus;</HI> but the difference of the feet forbade our judicious friend, <HI>M. Brisson</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Bris. Orn.</HI> vol. vi. p. 33. 70. 104.</NOTE>, from continuing them together; whose example we have fol∣lowed." <HI>Brit. Zool.</HI> 2.496.</P></NOTE>."</P>
<P>"The two last mentioned are, no doubt, birds not in full plumage. That described by <HI>Dr. Sparrman</HI> is clearly under the same predica∣ment; perhaps a still younger bird than either of the others, as the cinereous parts on the throat appear white, with three or four lines of black, and across the lower part of the neck is a band of white. The bird figured in <HI>Jacquin</HI> seems an adult."</P>
<P>That mentioned by <HI>Buffon</HI> was seventeen inches in length; had the breast mottled with ferruginous; and a white spot on the quills.</P>

<P>Size of a Blackbird. The body of the female is of a dull greenish colour; the wings are dusky inclining to green also; and the tail is nearly of the same obscure colour, except the two middle feathers which are of a pale yellow.</P>
<P>But the male is evidently one of the most beautiful birds that has ever been discovered in this island: the whole of the body which is a dull green in the female, is a lovely golden yellow, inclining to an orange colour in the male; the wings are black and form a most striking contrast; and the black stripe from the beak to the eye is no inconsiderable addition to its beauty.</P>
<P>It is rarely met with in England: PENNANT observes in the <HI>British Zoology</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1776.</NOTE>, that he only knew one instance of its being shot in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and that in <HI>South Wales:</HI> Latham says "it is now and then met with in England <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">List of the Birds of Great Britain. <HI>Supp.</HI></NOTE>;" and adds, in his Supplement, "Since the publication of my <HI>Synopsis</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1782.</NOTE>, this bird has been twice shot in England.

<P><PB REF="53"/>It <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Latham. <HI>Gen.

<P>A variety of this species, with the head and throat of a full black colour, is common in <HI>India,</HI> where it is called the <HI>Mango-bird,</HI> as it appears first at the ripening of that fruit, and is at that season in great plenty <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lady Impey.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"The nest is of a curious construction, but perhaps not quite so as some of the <HI>Orioles,</HI> though built after the same fashion. It is of the shape of a purse, fastened to the extreme divarications of the out∣most twigs of tall trees, and composed of fibres of hemp or straw, mixed with fine dry stalks of grass lined within with moss and liver∣wort. The <HI>female</HI> lays four or five eggs, of a dirty white, marked with small dark-brown spots, which are thickest about the largest end: she sits three weeks, and is observed to be very tender of her young,
<PB REF="54"/>
fearing nothing for their defence; not unfrequently will suffer herself to be taken with the eggs and nest, and continue to sit upon them till she dies."</P>
<P>"The food which this bird is most fond of is <HI>grapes</HI> and <HI>figs,</HI> in the season, also <HI>cherries,</HI> &amp;c. but at other times is contented with insects, and what else it can get."</P>
<P>"It has a loud cry that may be heard far off; but I do not hear it remarked by any one for the least song, though <HI>Gesner</HI> says it whistles before rain." <HI>Latham, Gen. Syn.</HI></P>

<P>Length from the point of the bill to the end of the feet twelve inches; breadth twenty-one. Weight twelve ounces. The bill is an inch and a quarter long, and of a very singular shape, much compressed on the sides, and near an inch and an half deep at the base; from whence both mandibles tend to a point, which is a little curved; across the upper are four oblique furrows; on the under three: half next the point is red; that next the base blue grey; and at the base is a <HI>cere</HI> full of minute holes: the nostrils are a long and narrow slit on each side, near the edge of the upper mandible, and parallel to it: the top of the head, the neck, and upper parts of the body black; beneath white: legs orange.</P>
<P>The bill, which gives such an appearance of novelty to this bird, varies considerably according to its age; in the first year it is small, weak, destitute of any furrow, and dusky; in the second year it is larger, stronger, of a paler colour, and discovers a faint vestige of a furrow near the base; but those of the third or more advanced years, have a bill of great strength and vivid colours as before described. Those birds are supposed to be imperfect until the third year; or at least not
<PB REF="58"/>
to breed before that period: not a single one has ever been discovered at <HI>Priestholm</HI> which had not the bill of an uniform size <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> p. 252; and figures of the different growth of the bill in pl. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>male</HI> very nearly resembles the <HI>female:</HI> in the former the white cheeks are sometimes obscured with a mixture of dark feathers, and in others a patch of the same colour has been observed on each side of the under jaw.</P>
<P>This species is very common in several parts on the coasts of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> they are seen in flocks innumerable at <HI>Priestholm Isle</HI> off the coast of <HI>Anglesea;</HI> in great numbers about the <HI>Needles,</HI> in the <HI>Isles of Wight, Man, Bardsey, Caldey, Farn, Godreve,</HI> and other small, and desert islands near the shore. A few about the rocks of <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>They are frequent in <HI>Ireland;</HI> on the island of <HI>Sherries,</HI> three leagues N. N. W. of <HI>Holyhead;</HI> and in the S. <HI>Stack,</HI> near <HI>Holyhead</HI> they breed in abundance. Inhabit <HI>Iceland</HI> and <HI>Greenland,</HI> and breed in the extreme part of the islands, especially on the west part of <HI>Disco,</HI> and the island <HI>Orpiksauk</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Latham V. p. 316.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the different parts it frequents, it has received a variety of appel∣lations, but generally expressive of the singular shape of the beak; as <HI>Coulter-neb</HI> in the <HI>Farn isles; Guldenhead, Bottle-nose,</HI> and <HI>Helegug</HI> in <HI>Wales;</HI> at <HI>Scarborough, Mullet;</HI> at <HI>Cornwall, Pope</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Will. orn.</NOTE>, and in the <HI>Ferroe isles, Lunda.</HI></P>
<P>To what part those birds emigrate on the approach of winter is very imperfectly known; it is probable when they retire from those northern regions, their flight is directed to some more temperate climate; per∣haps they live at sea, and form those multitudes of birds that navigators
<PB REF="59"/>
have observed in many parts of the ocean; they are always found there at certain seasons, but retire at the breeding time to the northern lati∣tudes, and during that time are found as near the <HI>Pole</HI> as navigators have ever penetrated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pen. Brit. Zool.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In <HI>America,</HI> they are said to frequent <HI>Carolina;</HI> and have been met with in <HI>Sandwich Sound,</HI> by our late voyagers: the natives ornament the fore parts and collars of their <HI>seal-skin</HI> jackets with the beaks of them; and in <HI>Aoonalashka,</HI> they make gowns of their skins, along with those of other birds.</P>
<P>On the coast of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> and the <HI>Kurilschi</HI> islands they are very common, even on the <HI>Penschinski Bay,</HI> almost as far as <HI>Ochotka:</HI> the nations of the two first wear the bills about their necks fastened to straps; these are put on by their <HI>Shaman</HI> or <HI>Priest,</HI> for the people are persuaded that by putting them on with a proper ceremony, they will procure good fortune to all their undertakings <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtsch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"About the fifth or tenth of April, they arrive in vast quantities at <HI>Priestholm isle;</HI> but quit the place again, and return twice or thrice before they settle to burrow, which they do the first week in <HI>May,</HI> when many of them dislodge the <HI>rabbits</HI> from their holes, by which they save themselves the trouble of forming one of their own: in the last case, they are so intent on what they are about, as to suffer them∣selves to be taken by the hand. It has been observed that this task falls chiefly to the share of the <HI>males,</HI> and that these last assist also in incuba∣tion: this has been proved on dissection. The <HI>female</HI> lays one white egg <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Albin observes "they build no nest, but lay their eggs on the bare ground"—"They lay but one egg apiece (which is especially remarkable)" "The eggs are very large for the bigness of the bird, even bigger than <HI>hens</HI> or <HI>ducks,</HI> of a <HI>reddish</HI> or <HI>sandy colour,</HI> much sharper at one end than <HI>hen's</HI> eggs, and blunter at the other." <HI>vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 78, 79.</P>
<P>But it appears very probable that Albin was mistaken as to the colour of the eggs, if we may judge by the concurrence of the best informed naturalists of the present time; "I must add," says Pennant, "that they lay only one egg, which differs much in form; some have one end very acute; others have both extremely obtuse; all are <HI>white. Brit. Zool.</HI></P></NOTE>. The young are hatched the beginning of <HI>July:</HI> and about the

Notwithstanding the neglect of their young at this time, no bird is more attentive to them in general, as they will suffer themselves to be taken by the hand, and use every means of defence in their power to save them; and, if laid hold of by the wings, will give themselves most cruel bites on any part of the body they can reach, as if actuated by despair; and when released, instead of flying away, will often hurry away into the burrow to their young." <HI>Lat.

<P>Linnaeus in the <HI>Fauna Succica</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2d edit. 37.</NOTE> observes that this elegant bird receives its name from the sound of its note; but by other naturalists it has been suspected that its name was originally derived from the French <HI>huppè</HI> or crested; as the crest is of a very curious structure, and alone is sufficient to distinguish it from every other European bird. It is the only species of the <HI>Hoopoe</HI> genus that is peculiar to the conti∣nent of Europe.</P>
<P><PB REF="65"/>It inhabits <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and is said to be met with in the large forests of <HI>Sweden</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> p. 37.</NOTE>, and in <HI>Austria</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scopoli.</NOTE>; and has been found as far north as the <HI>Orknies</HI> and <HI>Lapland,</HI> as well as in many of the intermediate places between them; at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> on one hand, and quite to <HI>Ceylon</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE> and <HI>Java</HI> on the other.

it is far from common, being seldom seen, and at uncertain times: it has been observed in <HI>Kent, Surrey, Northumberland,</HI> and <HI>Moyston</HI> in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> as well as in several other counties. A gentleman of vera∣city in <HI>Essex</HI> informs us that one was discovered last year in a hole in his garden wall, but being frightened away did not return again to that place. Among other proofs of its migrating into, and even breeding in <HI>England,</HI> Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> has mentioned several. "The year 1783 seems to have been more abundant in these birds than any I have yet heard of; one being shot near <HI>Oxford,</HI> on the coast of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> in <HI>May,</HI> and another seen near the same place the 24th of <HI>June</HI> following: these no doubt had bred thereabouts. The place where these were seen was a remarkable barren spot. In the month of <HI>September</HI> of the same year two were shot at <HI>Holderness,</HI> and many were seen in various parts of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and as far north as <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Turnstall.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Scotland.</HI> One was shot the 10th of <HI>September</HI> at <HI>Cam</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> another on <HI>Epping Forest,</HI> and a third in <HI>Surrey.</HI> A few years since a pair had begun to make a nest in <HI>Hampshire;</HI> but being too much disturbed, forsook it, and went elsewhere <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</NOTE>. The last year (1786) a young bird was sent to me, the 10th of <HI>May,</HI> full-sledged, shot near <HI>South-fleet,</HI>

in <HI>Kent</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Mr. G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dden of that place.</NOTE>; but the old birds had not been observed."—It was well known, as a visitor in <HI>England,</HI> at the time <HI>Albin</HI> published his History of Birds; his observations deserve notice. "The hen of this bird was shot in the garden of Mr. <HI>Starkey Mayos,</HI> at <HI>Woodford</HI> on <HI>Epping Forest,</HI> where they had observed it some time, and used all the means to take it they could; but it was so shy, that it avoided all their traps which were laid for it; which the gentleman observing, ordered it to be shot: it was sent to me to be preserved for him.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>The cock of this kind I drew from a picture done in <HI>Germany,</HI> by a great master there, now in the possession of Mr. <HI>Nisbet,</HI> a gentle∣man, who had it drawn from the bird when alive.</P>
<P>There is some difference in the colours of the hen, and this bird which was a cock, I was credibly informed by <HI>Robert Bristow,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
who saw both the drawings of the cock and hen, and told me his son shot the cock, which was like the drawing at his seat at <HI>Micheler,</HI> near <HI>Winchester</HI> in <HI>Hampshire.</HI></P> <BIBL><HI>Albin,</HI> Vol. II. 42, 43.</BIBL></Q>
<P><HI>Latham</HI> observes, "it is a solitary bird, and seldom more than two are seen together; though it is said that in <HI>Egypt</HI> it assembles in small troops. It is very common in <HI>Cairo,</HI> where it builds in the streets, on the terraces of houses, &amp;c. It is also common in the deserts of <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> though scarce beyond the river <HI>Ob;</HI> however some are found beyond the <HI>Lake Baikal.</HI> Dr. <HI>Pallas</HI> confirms the account of the filthy manners of this bird, as he met with an instance of a pair breeding in the privy of an uninhabited house in the suburbs of <HI>Tzaritzn</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arct. Zool.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"I am informed by colonel <HI>Davies,</HI> that they every year are seen in <HI>Gibraltar</HI> in <HI>March,</HI> in small flocks of ten or twelve; hence are
<PB REF="67"/>
called there <HI>March Cocks.</HI> They are supposed to come from <HI>Africa,</HI> and to be on their passage north to some other place, as they only stay a few hours to rest themselves: and it is not uncommon to see five or six flocks in a week, during the time of their passage. He did not ob∣serve them to have any note; but that they had a dipping kind of flight not unlike a <HI>Woodpecker.</HI> I have observed this Bird to be among paintings both from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>India;</HI> it is therefore no doubt com∣mon to both those parts." <HI>Lath. Gen. Syn.</HI></P>
<P>In Sweden the appearance of this Bird is regarded as a presage of war; and in England its visits were formerly considered as ominous by the vulgar.</P>
<P>In Turkey it is called <HI>Tir Chaous,</HI> or the Messenger Bird from the resemblance its crest has to the plumes worn by the <HI>Chaous,</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> couriers.</P>
<P>Latham says, the <HI>female</HI> is like the <HI>male,</HI> and lays from two to seven eggs; but for the most part four or five. These are somewhat less than those of a Partridge, but longer and ash-coloured. This Bird is said to have two or three broods in a year, and to lay the eggs in the holes of trees, like the <HI>Woodpecker,</HI> but in general to make no nest: notwithstanding which, <HI>Buffon</HI> observed, that two out of six nests, which were brought to him for inspection, had a soft lining of moss, wool, leaves, feathers, and the like; and he is of opinion, that when this is the case, the bird has made use of the old nest of some other bird. It will also lay, and hatch the young in holes of walls, and even on the ground. The food of this bird is insects; and it is the exuviae of the large beetles, and such like, with which the nest is crouded, that cause the nest to stink so horribly; insomuch that former writers asserted the nest to be made of excrement.</P>
<P><PB REF="68"/>In <HI>Sepp</HI>'s plate the nest is placed in the hollow of a tree; it is composed of soft bents, and smooth within. The eggs, four in number, of a blueish white, marked with pale brown spots.</P>
<P><HI>Buffon</HI> mentions one of this species which lived with a lady for three months, subsisting only on bread and cheese; and, contrary to the common opinion, drank frequently, and that by gulps. Another was kept for eighteen months on raw meat, and would not eat any thing else.</P>
<P><HI>Olina</HI> says, that this bird lives three years.</P>
<P>In some countries it is esteemed as good eating. It seldom perches on trees, unless they are very low. It does not erect its crest, except when agitated by surprize: in a natural state the crest falling behind the neck <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>; but whenever it alights on the ground, it is said to spread its crest beautifully.</P>
<P>Some authors mention a variety of this species. <HI>Kolben</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en. Hist. du Cap.

Another specimen from the same place, had the upper part of the beak of a deep brown, and the belly varied with brown and white; but as this was less in every respect, it was probably a young bird.</P>
<P><HI>Gerini</HI> mentions one which he saw at <HI>Florence,</HI> and again on the <HI>Alps,</HI> which had the crest bordered with sky-blue. <HI>Orn. Ital. Hist. des <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is.</HI> VI. p. 462.</P>

<P><PB REF="71"/>This bird measures five inches from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail: it is of a lively appearance, though not very beautiful in the colours of its plumage; and deserves our immediate attention as one of the least known species we have in this country.</P>
<P>It is a native of <HI>France</HI> as well as of <HI>England.</HI> In <HI>Provence</HI> it is commonly found among cabbages: it feeds on the insects that harbour among those vegetables, and not unfrequently conceals itself under the shelter of the leaves during the night.</P>
<P>A friend of Mr. Latham's shot a pair of those birds on <HI>Bexley Heath,</HI> near <HI>Dartford</HI> in <HI>Kent, April</HI> the 10th, 1773, as they were sitting on a furze bush: they fed on flies; springing from the bush every time one approached near, and returning to the same place repeatedly; thereby imitating, as he observes, the manners of our <HI>Cinereous Flycatcher.</HI></P>
<P>This species resides with us in the winter. Several specimens, which are now preserved in the Leverian Museum, were shot on a common near <HI>Wandsworth</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> 1782.</P>
<P>Mr. Latham appears to entertain some doubt, whether this species ever breeds in France <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Ois. v. p. 158.</NOTE>.

<P>This species measures fourteen or fifteen inches from the tip of the bill to the extremity of the tail: extent twenty three, weight nineteen ounces. Its summer dress varies exceedingly from that which it as∣sumes in winter; in the former the general colour is pale brown, or ash-colour, not inelegantly marked, or mottled with dusky bars, spots,
<PB REF="80"/>
rust colour, &amp;c. in both sexes, but in the latter, the female is entirely of a very beautiful white; the male of the same colour, but is distin∣guished by a dark dash, or line which passes from the bill to the eye, and by the shafts of the first seven quill feathers being black; the twelve extreme feathers of the tail are of the same black colour.</P>
<P>Our figure is copied from a male bird which has not wholly assumed its winter appearance, but is in the last stage of changing its summer dress, as appears from the slight intermixture of dark feathers on its breast and back.</P>
<P>It inhabits most of the northern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> even as far as <HI>Groenland,</HI> in <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Siberia</HI> it is very frequent; it is seen in plenty on the <HI>Alpine</HI> mountains of <HI>Savoy,</HI> on the <HI>Alps,</HI> and mount <HI>Cenis.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Great Britain</HI> it is met with on the summits of the highest hills in the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland.

"I have received both species at the same time from <HI>Norway,</HI> and am convinced that they are not the same." <HI>Penn.</HI></P>
<P>The female lays eight or ten eggs, spotted with red-brown, the size of those of a Pigeon, on the earth, in a stony situation, about the middle of June <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Latham.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB REF="81"/>Authors agree that they are stupid silly birds, and are so tame as to be drawn into any snare; or suffer themselves to be taken by the hand; if the hen is killed the <HI>male</HI> will not forsake her.

<P>This species is near seventeen inches in length; the plumage is en∣tirely black, except the crown of the head, which is of a vermilion colour, rather inclining to crimson; the bill, and claws, are of con∣siderable strength, particularly the latter, which are curved in a more formidable manner than those even of many rapacious birds of equal magnitude.</P>
<P>The <HI>female</HI> differs from the <HI>male</HI> in the general colour of the plu∣mage; that of the <HI>female,</HI> having a strong cast of brown on the back, and the vermilion coloured feathers, with which the whole crown of the <HI>male</HI> is invested, being only sparingly diffused on the crown of the fe∣male, though they terminate in a rich tuft on the hind part of the head.</P>
<P>Both <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female</HI> are very liable to variations in the red on the crown; some are adorned with a profusion of those feathers, while others have scarcely any; and specimens have been met with entirely black, without even a trace of the vermilion colour on their heads.</P>
<P>As an <HI>English</HI> Woodpecker it is the largest we have; it even con∣siderably exceeds the size of the GREEN WOODPECKER, <HI>Picus Viri∣dis.</HI> It is very rare in this country, and generally believed to have been only observed in the southern parts, and in <HI>Devonshire</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> writes, "Mr. <HI>Tarsiall</HI> tells me, that he has been informed by a skilful Omithologist, of its being sometimes seen in <HI>Devonshire."

<P><PB REF="85"/>It is found in almost every part of <HI>Europe,</HI> but is plenty only in <HI>Germany;</HI> it is rarely seen in <HI>France;</HI> never in <HI>Italy;</HI> and only during the summer in <HI>Sweden, Switzerland,</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI> Extends to <HI>Russia,</HI> where it is common in the woods from <HI>St. Petersburgh,</HI> to <HI>Ochotsk</HI> on the <HI>eastern</HI> Ocean, and to <HI>Lapmark</HI> on the <HI>west</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arct.

<P>"This species is so very destructive to Bees, that the <HI>Baschirians</HI> in the neighbourhood of the river <HI>Ufa,</HI> as well as the inhabitants of other parts, (who form holes in the trees twenty-five or thirty feet from the ground, wherein the <HI>Bees</HI> may deposit their store), take every precaution to hinder the access of this bird; and in particular are cau∣tious to guard the mouth, of the hive with sharp thorns; notwithstand∣ing which, the <HI>Woodpecker</HI> finds means to prove a very destructive enemy: and it is observed to be in most plenty where the Bees are in the greatest numbers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dec.

<P>Its food does not consist entirely of <HI>Bees; Albin</HI> writes of the bird he has figured, "The guts are seventeen inches long, great and lax; the stomach also lax and membraneous, full of <HI>Hexapods</HI> and <HI>Ants.</HI> It wants the <HI>appendices</HI> or blind guts as the rest of this tribe."</P>
<P>Its nest is capacious and deep, and is said to be usually built in old <HI>Ash</HI> or <HI>Poplar trees; Frisch</HI> observes, that they often so excavate a tree, that it is soon after blown down with the wind; and that under the hole of this bird may often be found a bushel of dust and bits of wood.</P>
<P>The <HI>female</HI> lays two or three white eggs; which colour, according to <HI>Willughby</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Zool. Danic.</NOTE>, is peculiar to the whole genus, or at least to all those which have come under his inspection.</P>

<P>The Yellow Wren ranks among the least of the British Birds; it measures only four inches and three quarters from the tip of the bill to the extremity of the tail. The colours of its plumage are not at∣tractive, neither do we introduce it as a rare bird, being one of our most frequent species; but it is a very delicately formed creature, ex∣ceedingly active, and by concealing itself immediately among the thickest of the foliage when any noise approaches, it may not be so generally known as some less timid birds.</P>
<P>It chiefly frequents large woods, which abound with willows; and builds its nest at the roots of trees, or in the hollows of dry banks; it is constructed in the form of an egg, with a hole at the top for its entrance, the outside is composed of moss and hay, or straw; and the inside is lined with soft feathers, wool, or hair. It lays seven white eggs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant Br. Zool. <HI>1. 151.</HI></NOTE>, or, according to <HI>Latham</HI> and <HI>Albin,</HI> only five; they are freckled all over with reddish spots. Its note is low and plaintive, scarcely more than <HI>twit, twit</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Latham.</NOTE>, which it utters when it is running up and down the branches of trees in search of insects on which it feeds. It is said that the male has a song during incubation, far from unplea∣sing, and is soft, though weak. It is migratory, but visits us early.</P>
<P><PB REF="89"/><HI>Albin</HI> says it sings like a grashopper, and frequents woods and soli∣tary places, sitting on the tops of oaks.</P>
<P><HI>Pennant</HI> observes, that the breast, belly, and thighs, vary in colour in different birds; in some those parts are of a bright yellow, in others they fade almost into white. The legs also appear to admit of varia∣tion, those of our specimens are yellowish in both sexes, <HI>Albin</HI> de∣scribes those of his male specimen to be pale amber colour, and those of the hen to be black.</P>
<P><HI>Latham,</HI> in his <HI>Gen. Syn.</HI> has given a description of four other birds, which he considers only as varieties of the MOTACILLA TROCHILUS. Among those are included the GREATER NON-CRESTED REGULUS of <HI>Willughby,</HI> and the MOTACILLA ACREDULA of <HI>Lin∣naeus.</HI> This latter bird appears in the <HI>British Zoology</HI> of <HI>Pennant</HI> as a new species, (the Scotch Wren;) it has been also considered as a distinct kind in the writings of some, and the synonymas of others, as <HI>Brisson, Buffon, Ray, Sloane, Catesby,</HI> and <HI>Edwards,</HI> but as it dif∣fered from our species only in the colour of the upper parts, inclining more to brown than to green, and the lower parts more to yellow, Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> concluded it was only a variety. It is a native of <HI>Ja∣maica, Carolina,</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> but one was communicated to Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> by <HI>E. S. Fraser,</HI> Esq. who informed him that it was shot in the <HI>Highlands of Scotland.</HI></P>

<P>This bird is very common in <HI>England;</HI> is said to inhabit <HI>Sweden,</HI> and thence to extend even to <HI>Italy;</HI> the fulness of its plumage enables it to bear the inclemencies of the northern regions in winter, but it admits of some surprize that such as are found in warmer countries are not clothed with a plumage more adapted to the climate.</P>
<P>The length is five inches and a quarter, the breadth seven inches, the tail is remarkably long in proportion to the size of the body; in form it is like that of a magpie, consists of twelve feathers of unequal lengths; those in the middle are the longest, those on each side grow gradually shorter. The legs are generally black, but of some specimens are brown.</P>
<P><PB REF="97"/>The form of the nest is almost peculiar to this species only, it is of an oval shape, with a small hole or entrance in the side; the mate∣rials of the external part are moss, liverwort, and wool, curiously in∣terwoven, the inside is lined with a thick bed of the softest feathers. The nest is not suspended from a bough as is usual with some of the tribe, but is built between the forked branches of low wood, about three feet from the ground: they generally contain from ten to seven∣teen or even twenty eggs of greyish colour, speckled with pale red-brown.</P>
<P>Those birds are most frequent in gardens and orchards, to which they do much injury by devouring the tender shoots; they are very active, and fly to and fro with great facility, or run up and down the branches in every direction. The parents and their offspring remain together the whole winter, but separate in the spring <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The young follow the parents the whole winter; and from the slimness of their bodies, and great length of tail, appear, while flying, like so many darts cutting the air," <HI>Pennant.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The male has more of the rose colour than the female; in the former however it is subject to much variation.</P>

<P>The male Pine Grosbeak is certainly one of the most beautiful of the feathered tribe that inhabit either of the sister countries of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> It measures nine inches from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, its weight two ounces; the general colour of its plu∣mage is rose-coloured crimson, and black, elegantly marked with white on the edges of the feathers: the bill, which is remarkably stout, and curved at the tip, is well adapted for the purpose of dividing the cones of the pines to obtain the seeds.</P>
<P>The female has not the beautiful appearance of the male; the principal colour of her plumage is dirty green, inclining to brown, the crown of the head varied only with a few reddish or yellowish teints, and some feathers of the same colour slightly dispersed over the back, breast, and belly.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> this species is found only in the most northern parts, or is probably entirely confined to <HI>Scotland;</HI> like the Crossbill it inhabits the pine forests in the <HI>Highlands; Pennant</HI> suspects that they breed there, as he has observed them flying above the great pine forests of <HI>Inver∣cauld, Aberdcenshire,</HI> in the month of August.</P>
<P><PB REF="101"/>It is found in the pine forests also of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the northern parts of <HI>Russia</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Common about St. <HI>Petersburgh</HI> in autumn, and is caught in great plenty at that time for the use of the table, returning north in spring." <HI>Pennant.</HI></NOTE>, of <HI>Siberia,</HI> and <HI>Lapland;</HI> they are also common in the northern parts of <HI>America:</HI> from April to September they are frequent at <HI>Hudson's Bay;</HI> the southern settlements are inhabited by them throughout the year.

<P>Those Birds migrate to our shores in the spring, but are never very numerous; they remain with us during the summer, and depart in autumn. They run lightly, and with much swiftness, and when dis∣turbed take short flights; at the same time they make a loud twitter∣ing noise.</P>
<P>The female makes no nest, but deposits four eggs on the ground, under some convenient shelter; the eggs are about one inch and an half in length, of a dull whitish colour, spotted and blotched with black.</P>
<P><PB REF="105"/>The same species is found in several parts of the Continent; in <HI>Greenland,</HI> and in <HI>America.</HI> Latham observes that it visits <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> the middle of June, and departs in September.

<P>The length of the male is twelve inches, of the female ten inches; the bill of the former is yellow in some, in others black, or dark brown; the face is covered with yellow pear-shaped pimples; the back part of the head and neck are furnished with long feathers, which expand in a very singular manner on each side of the neck, and impend loosely over the breast, like the ruff anciently worn in this country. A portion or tuft of those feathers project also just beyond each eye, and have the appearance of long ears.</P>
<P>As the most remarkable peculiarity of those birds are that no two specimens are ever found to agree in the colours of the plumage, it is impossible to give any description, except of its form, that may assist the unskilful ornithologist to determine the species, when it
<PB REF="109"/>
has attained the ruff; it cannot, however, be mistaken, as no Bird of this country resembles it in the smallest degree. The ground colour is generally brown, but it varies in different Birds to every hue between the lightest teint that can deserve that name, and the deepest chocolate colour; sometimes we find the ruff of a fine tender buff colour, without the slightest appearance of spots, except on the breast and back, which may be of a deep black, intermingled with a few white feathers, and glossed with shining purple; others we find that have the ruffs of a deep brown, barred with black; some with white ruffs spotted with brown, or brown spotted with white; and indeed with every variation that it is possible to describe.</P>
<P>The <HI>females,</HI> or <HI>Reeves,</HI> Pennant asserts, never change their colours, which he says are pale brown; the back spotted with black, slightly edged with white; the tail brown; the middle feathers spotted with black; the breast and belly white; the legs of a pale dull yellow: but I have two specimens that do not well agree with his description, or correspond with each other; and in the Leverian museum a variety of that sex is preserved that is wholly white, except the wings, on which the usual markings are visible in a very pale colour.</P>
<P>The female has no ruff, and the male does not attain that appendage until the second season; at the time of incubation the plumage of the latter is in the full perfection, and the pimples break out on his face: but after that time they shrink beneath the skin, the long feathers of the ruff fall off, and he again assumes the plain appearance of the female.</P>
<P>These Birds inhabit the North of <HI>Europe</HI> in summer, as far as Ice∣land, as well as the northern marshes of <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Siberia.</HI> In this country they are found in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> and in the east
<PB REF="110"/>
riding of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brit. Zool.</NOTE>; they arrive at those places early in the spring, and disappear about <HI>Michaelmas.</HI></P>
<P>The Reeve lays four eggs in a tuft of grass the beginning of May; they are white, marked with large rusty spots.</P>
<P>Soon after their arrival, the males begin to <HI>hill;</HI> that is, to collect on some dry bank near a splash of water, in expectation of the females. Each male keeps possession of a small piece of ground, round which it runs so often as to form a bare circular path; the instant a female alights among them, the males are in motion; a general battle ensues, and the fowlers, who have been waiting for the advantage of such an event, catch them in their nets in great numbers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They visit a place called <HI>Martin-mere</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> the latter end of March, or beginning of April, but do not continue there above three weeks.—<HI>Brit. Zool.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the fens each male remains within his circle, and defends himself against every invader with much resolution; the least infringement on his possession by another male is resented with the greatest violence; and if any farther attack is made, a battle is the consequence: in fighting they have the same action as a cock, spread their ruffs, and place their bills to the ground.</P>
<P>"It is usual to sat these birds for table by means of <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>milk</HI> mixed with <HI>hemp-seed,</HI> and sometimes boiled <HI>wheat;</HI> to these by many <HI>sugar</HI> is added; which last in a fortnight's time will cause them to be one lump of fat, when they will fetch from two shillings to half a crown each."—<HI>Lath.

<P>The Coldfinch, or according to Latham and Pennant, the Pied Fly-catcher, is found in <HI>Yorkshire, Lancashire,</HI> and <HI>Derbyshire;</HI> in those parts of the kingdom it is not very frequent, in every other it is ex∣tremely rare.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary for us to describe the many varieties that are known of this species; in England the colours of its plumage varies consi∣derably at different seasons of the year; but such as are natives of fo∣reign countries, are again so dissimilar to ours, that different authors have alternately described them as varieties, or new species.</P>
<P>The bird that <HI>Latham</HI> describes, was white on the outer web of the exterior tail feather; the two exterior tail feathers of <HI>Willoughby</HI>'s bird was marked with white; and on the contrary, we have a speci∣men which does not exhibit the least trace of white on either. The upper tail coverts are black and white mixed, in some specimens; in others they are wholly black; and <HI>Le Gobe-mouche noir</HI> of <HI>Brisson,</HI> which is only another variety, differs in having a mixture of grey on
<PB REF="122"/>
the upper parts, the thighs brown and white, and <HI>three</HI> of the exte∣rior tail feathers white on the margins.</P>
<P>A more pleasing variety than either, is found in <HI>Lorraine</HI> and <HI>Brie;</HI> it corresponds in size with those found in England; but the white of the breast which terminates under the cheeks in the latter, passes quite round the neck like a collar in the former <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This variety is called by Buffon <HI>Le Gobemouche noir à Collier.</HI> Hist. des Ois. 4. p. 520. pl. 25. f. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The plumage of the female is brown in those parts where the male is black; it has no white on the forehead; the white spot on the wing is more obscure; and the under parts of the body is of a dusky white. The male possesses only the full black during the summer; as that season declines, its plumage alters, and it gradually assumes so per∣fectly the appearance of the female, that he cannot be distinguished from her.</P>
<P>The nest is usually built in the hole of a tree, not very near the ground; it is composed of fibres, mixed with moss, and contains six eggs. It feeds on Insects.</P>

<P>The length of this species is fourteen inches; its breadth thirty; and its weight four ounces and a quarter. It is very common on the sea-coasts, banks of lakes and rivers in this country during summer; it quits the breeding places at the approach of winter, and returns in spring.</P>
<P>It is found in various parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia;</HI> in the summer as far as <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> It is also found in <HI>America;</HI> arrives at <HI>New England</HI> in May, and disappears in Autumn. At <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> it is known by the name of <HI>Black-head</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lath. Gen. Syn.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB REF="126"/>Dr. Forster mentions a variety at <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> having the Legs black; Tail shorter and less forked; and the outer feathers wholly white <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. vol. <HI>lxii.</HI> p. <HI>421.</HI></NOTE>: The Bird Albin has figured in his plate 88, vol. 2. appears also to be a variety; the legs are black, and the bill is of the same colour, except the tip, which is red.</P>
<P>These Birds breed among tufts of rushes, grass, or moss near the water side; they lay three or four eggs, about an inch and three quarters in length, of a dull olive colour, marked with irregular black spots, and sprinkled with specks of an obscure brown in June; the young birds are hatched in July, and quit the nest soon after.</P>
<P>They feed on small fish and water insects; are very clamorous and daring; and during the time of incubation, will dart on any person who may pass by their nest, though they should neither provoke nor disturb them.</P>
<P>It appears to have all the actions over the water which the Swallow has on land, skimming and describing vast circuits over the surface of the waves when seeking its prey, diving with intrepidity the instant it discovers it, and instantly appearing again on the wing with the fish in its mouth. Notwithstanding the affinity of its actions with those of the Swallow, <HI>Pennant,</HI> in the British Zoology, has altered the name to <HI>Tern,</HI> "a name," he observes in a note, "these birds are known by in the <HI>North of England;</HI> and which we substitute instead of the old compound one of <HI>Sea-Swallow;</HI> which was given them on account of their forked tails."</P>

<P>The Water-Ouzel is a very shy and solitary bird, and though well known as a British species, is generally confined to such parts as abound with small rivulets, or with waters that course between the craggy fragments of mountains; it is therefore that we find it plenty only in <HI>Wales, Cumberland, Yorkshire,</HI> and <HI>Westmoreland.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="130"/>It feeds on small fish and insects: its nest is built among the stones on the ground near the water side; beneath the small shelving rocks that over-hang the streams it frequents; or in holes contrived in steep and perpendicular banks; it is composed of hay and fibres of roots, is lined with dead oak leaves, has a covering of green moss, and contains five eggs of a white colour with a blush of red. In young birds the belly is wholly white.</P>
<P>Most authors have noticed the very singular manner in which it searches for its prey, it not only dives under the water, but will fly and run after them at the bottom in the same manner as on land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des. Ois.—Dacouv. Rus. vol. <HI>i.</HI> p. <HI>307. 314.</HI></NOTE>: <HI>Kramer</HI> says, that one of them had been caught under water by means of a line and hook, which had been baited to catch fish <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Albin says, "it feeds on fish, yet refuseth not insects; sitting on the banks of rivers it now and then flirts up its tail; although it be not web-footed, <HI>yet it will sometimes dive or dart quite under water.</HI> It is a solitary bird, accompanying only with its mate in coupling and breeding time."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These birds are smaller than the Ring-Ouzel, their length is seven, and breadth eleven inches, weight two ounces and an half; they are found in <HI>Europe</HI> as high as <HI>Feroe</HI> and <HI>Finmark</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Arct.
