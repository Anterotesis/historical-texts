<HEAD>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT being peculiarly the business of a dramatic writer, to
select those popular topics upon which he is assured of having the
public voice with him, it might na∣turally be expected that, after receiving
Your ROYAL HIGHNESS's gracious per∣mission to lay this Dramatic Essay
at Your feet, I should eagerly have availed myself of the opportunity thus
given me, of ex∣patiating on those manners, talents, and virtues, which
constitute so general a theme of admiration. But minds truly <PB REF="3"/>
conscious of meriting praise are ever re∣served and delicate in accepting
it: and perhaps Your ROYAL HIGHNESS will not suffer a sincere
acknowledgment of merit, because the panegyric of Princes has been too often
stained with adulation.</P>
<P>Restrained by this consideration, I must content myself
with offering my humble acknowledgments for the honour confer∣red on me, in the
countenance of my fee∣ble endeavours to cultivate an elegant art which so
eminently boasts the protection of Your ROYAL HIGHNESS.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, with the most profound respect, Your ROYAL
HIGHNESS's Most obedient, And most devoted servant, JAMES COBB.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the STRANGERS AT HOME would think himself guilty
of great injustice, if at a moment when the Piece is so highly honoured by
the public approbation, he should forget how much of that approbation he owes
to the abilities of the Performers, all of whom so kindly interested
themselves in its suc∣cess. To Mr. KING he has peculiar obligations, for
the care and attention with which he superintended the rehearsals of the
Opera; and to that Gentleman's judi∣cious criticisms he is likewise highly
indebted. Al∣though it might be superfluous for the Author to add his
praises to those which the public have so liberally and deservedly
bestowed on Mr. LINLEY's Music, he cannot but congratulate himself on
having had the as∣sistance of so able a Master.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGNALTO.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means: you know my suspicions of Aldobrand, with whom
I left the charge of my sister, and my house. I am re∣solved to remain

<P>Have a little patience.</P>

<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir! patience is a bad physician; he has worn me to a

change in me! But here comes the Algerine cap∣tain who brought us over.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter MONTANO.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGNALTO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Noble Ibrahim! I thank Heaven that I am at length arrived where
I may be enabled properly to acknowledge that benevo∣lence whose rays
illumined our night of slavery. Nay, start not! are you surprized to find
gratitude among the Christian virtues?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, my generous friend; wide as the sun darts his beams, he
finds that precious jewel, which decks alike the Turban and the Cross!</P>

<SPEAKER>REGNALTO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let me express the grateful sentiments I

<P>We must hasten to offer our respects to the generous
Oc∣tavio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had much rather offer my respects to a well-covered table:
we shall be in better spirits after supper; my gratitude will grow
stronger as my stomach gets fuller.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGNALTO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away! no trifling. We must pay our compliments where they are
due.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, if it must be so, I'll follow you presently:
though mine, I fear, will be but empty compliments.—Ha! here comes 
<PB N="13" REF="10"/> our fellow-captive, Firelock, the English soldier;
that merry old fellow, whose jests and songs made us so often forget
our sorrows.</P>
<STAGE>Enter FIRELOCK.</STAGE>
<P>Once more welcome to European ground, my old son of fun and
frolic!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, my boy! and a son who has never dishonour'd his family.
'Tis only your common dull metal that rusts with the breath of care and
misfortune: the high polish of mirth and good-humour always cast off the
envenomed damp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you really never meet with any misfortune which obliged
you to complain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I never remember lamenting but two misfortunes in my
whole life: one, that I was not at the Prussian re∣view; and the other,
that I had not the honour of being among the brave fellows besieged in
Gibraltar.—But that's all over now! However, I hope I shall yet live to
fight for my country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am going to return thanks to Signor Octavio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>So shall I, as soon as I am drest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Drest!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, I hardly dare call myself an Englishman while I wear
the badges of slavery. Our noble captain, Ibrahim, has kindly presented me
with the very cloaths in which I was taken by the Algerines: so, within an
hour, you shall see me in that character which commands respect in every
part of the world—a British soldier!—and then I shall want
nothing but a mistress to make me compleatly happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>They, you know, are to be purchased every where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but I would as soon think of buying a friend as a
mis∣tress. Always barter love for love, and friendship for friend∣ship:
for, egad! when either of the commodities are put up to sale, depend upon it
they are not worth buying. However, I don't despair of making myself pretty
well understood by some kind Florentine girl or other. Love, I take it, is
an universal language; much the same in most countries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, you will remember, it is a language in which the oldest
scholars are not generally the greatest proficients!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, young man! But I fear nothing. I am a
mixture of spring and autumn: old Time and I have had so long a battle,
that he has given up the point at last, and left me master of the field.
Besides, if even a mistress should be coy, I have yet my bottle to
comfort me.</P>

<P>There are all the people in Florence out at their windows,
gaping at this scurvy procession of slaves. Tinkle but an old brass
shovel in the streets of this city, and the inhabitants will swarm like
bees at the sound! One would think there was a triumph for some victory,
to-day.</P>

what a nobler victory, than that of freedom over slavery!</P>

<P>Do you really think he will?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALDOBRAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes! these rakish young dogs begin to make love the

<STAGE>Enter ALICE, and LAURENCE with a Bottle of Wine in one Hand

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>TELL the cook to make haste, Alice. I like my victuals rather
under done.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been us'd to eat your meat rare, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the meat that came to my share in Algiers was very
<HI>rare,</HI> indeed!—not above once a month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how did they treat you, Laurence? Tell me all about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>They treated me with my <HI>board,</HI> to be sure—to
sleep on, I mean; a scarcity of bread and water; and plenty of stripes
and hard labour. For my part, I had rather pay my own way in Florence, than be
<HI>treated</HI> so by the best Algerine of 'em all!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Laurence, had your master many wives?</P>
</SP>

<P>Wives! aye, in every hole and corner of his house: they ran
about like rabbits in a warren!</P>

<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not you turn poacher now and then, and snap up a
stray rabbit?—Eh! Laurence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, indeed! I had a much keener appetite for a fat
capon.—Hunger is a bitter enemy to gallantry!—Besides, the
Infidels have ways of keeping their wives to themselves, which we have not
yet attain'd.</P>

<P>By making slaves of them!—Thank my stars, that odious
fashion does not prevail in Christendom!</P>

countries, the wives keep their husbands in subjection."—But here

ill-manners, by any other set of people, before or since!</P>

<P>Aye, that is a true oracle; always doubtful in it's meaning. We
lawyers are the priests, and who so proper to expound it as we who make it?
The letter of the law reminds me of a fanciful cloud in a summer sky;
though no two persons can agree in what it really represents, you may look

<P>Modern Justice is only blind to the faults of her friends.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALDOBRAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reserves that for their enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—Then her scales only remain to be dispos'd
of!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALDOBRAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which are too useful to be parted with. They are for the
receipt of fees; one scale for the plaintiff, and the other for the

<P>Well, Alice, then the charming Viola is permitted by her
guardian to visit this house to-day? You may depend on my gratitude!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>"ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I will, Sir; though I own it is not a quality on which,
generally speaking, I place the greatest dependance.</P>

<SPEAKER>"OCTAVIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Surely you do not doubt it's existence: you do not think it a
mere phantom."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Sir, my experience has taught me, that gratitude is
something like a ghost; every body talks of it, but nobody sees it
appear!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, I can easily conjure up the apparition!— 
<STAGE>[Giving her a Purse.]</STAGE> How do you like it?</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh! I admire your <HI>spirit,</HI> I assure you, Sir! It

<P>But tell me, dear Alice! how am I to elude the vigilance of
Aldobrand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very easily, Sir. You must know the old fool expects to meet
Laura her, with whom he is most desperately in love!—But I see him
coming: I'll engage him, while you slip down stairs, and entertain your
mistress.</P>

<P>Fail, Sir! there is no such word in the lover's
dictionary.</P>

<L>Young Roger the ploughman, who wanted a mate,</L>
<L>Went along with his daddy a courting to Kate;</L>
<L>With nosegay so large, in his holiday cloaths,</L>
<L>(His hands in his pockets) away Roger goes.</L>
<L>Now he was as bashful as bashful could be;</L>
<L>And Kitty, poor girl, was as bashful as he:</L>

said—nothing at all.</L>

<L>If aukward the swain, no less aukward the maid;</L>
<L>She simper'd and blush'd, with her apron-string
play'd:</L>
<L>Till the old folks, impatient to have the thing done,</L>
<L>Agreed that young Roger and Kate should be one.</L>
<L>In silence the young ones both nodded assent:</L>
<L>Their hands being join'd, to be married they went;</L>

small,</L>
<L>You'd have sworn that they both had said—nothing
at all.</L>

speak;</L>
<L>Could joke with his deary, laugh loud at the jest:</L>

<P>Algerine captain!—Oh, you mean the man with the turban,
whom I met just now stealing down the dark private stair-case which
leads to the garden, with his hands before his face, like a sulky child
endeavouring to escape a whipping! There is no fear of your losing him,
Sir, except he can creep through the key-hole; for I lock'd the door as I came
up, and put the key in my pocket, to prevent old Aldobrand's surprizing
us.</P>

<P>Well, Madam! and do not I run the risque of having my heart
<HI>sensibly touch'd</HI> by the point of a small-sword! Let me tell
you, that is much the worst touch of the two. I repeat to you, Madam, that
old rogue Aldobrand has let Ibrahim escape; and, while he is at liberty, I
dare not venture abroad.</P>

<P>There might be, I grant you, from the lips of a youthful
gal∣lant, like Ibrahim; "in whose breast the passion glows hotenough to
scorch the reputation of every female who exposes herself to it's
influence:" but, as for poor old Aldobrand—Lord, Ma'am! in him it is the
mere Aurora Borealis of love; a few straggling faint rays from the sun that
is set, which vanish al∣most as soon as they are seen, and have only
the appearance of heat without the reality!—To give me a fair occasion
for com∣ing into the room, you must scream out; upon which I rush in,
and—But who have we here?</P>

<P>No, Madam; I once had a pretty snug little estate, which my
wife and my friends obligingly help'd me soon to get rid of: so, as I was
too honest, or too proud, to live by the same means as many of my
neighbours, I paid my debts, as far as I could, and took up a brown musquet.
The expectation of happier days has supported me through all my misfortunes,
