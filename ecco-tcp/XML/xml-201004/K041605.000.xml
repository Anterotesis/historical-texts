<LG>
<L>SUCH were the Notes, thy once-lov'd Poet sung,</L>
<L>'Till Death untimely stop'd his tuneful Tongue.</L>
<L>Oh just beheld, and lost! admir'd, and mourn'd!</L>
<L>With softest Manners, gentlest Arts, adorn'd!</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>Blest in each Science, blest in ev'ry Strain!</L>
<L>Dear to the Muse, to HARLEY dearâ€”in vain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For him, thou oft hast bid the World attend,</L>
<L>Fond to forget the Statesman in the Friend;</L>
<L>For <HI>Swift</HI> and him, despis'd the Farce of State,</L>
<L>The sober Follies of the Wise and Great;</L>
<L>Dextrous, the craving, fawning Crowd to quit,</L>
<L>And pleas'd to 'scape from Flattery to Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Absent or dead, still let a Friend be dear,</L>
<L>(A Sigh the Absent claims, the Dead a Tear)</L>
<L>Recall those Nights that clos'd thy toilsom Days,</L>
<L>Still hear thy <HI>Parnell</HI> in his living Lays:</L>
<L>Who careless, now, of Int'rest, Fame, or Fate,</L>
<L>Perhaps forgets that OXFORD e'er was Great;</L>
<L>Or deeming meanest what we greatest call,</L>
<L>Beholds thee glorious only in thy Fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>And sure if ought below the Seats Divine</L>
<L>Can touch Immortals, 'tis a Soul like thine:</L>
<L>A Soul supreme, in each hard Instance try'd,</L>
<L>Above all Pain, all Anger, and all Pride,</L>
<L>The Rage of Pow'r, the Blast of publick Breath,</L>
<L>The Lust of Lucre, and the Dread of Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain to Desarts thy Retreat is made;</L>
<L>The Muse attends thee to the silent Shade:</L>
<L>'Tis hers, the brave Man's latest Steps to trace,</L>
<L>Re-judge his Acts, and dignify Disgrace.</L>
<L>When Int'rest calls off all her sneaking Train,</L>
<L>When all th' Oblig'd desert, and all the Vain;</L>
<L>She waits, or to the Scaffold, or the Cell,</L>
<L>When the last ling'ring Friend has bid farewel.</L>
<L>Ev'n now she shades thy Evening Walk with Bays,</L>
<L>(No Hireling she, no Prostitute to Praise)</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>Ev'n now, observant of the parting Ray,</L>
<L>Eyes the calm Sun-set of thy Various Day,</L>
<L>Thro' Fortune's Cloud One truly Great can see,</L>
<L>Nor fears to tell, that MORTIMER is He.</L>

<HEAD><PB REF="7"/><HI>HESIOD:</HI> OR, THE Rise of WOMAN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHAT antient Times (those Times we fancy wise)</L>
<L>Have left on long Record of <HI>Woman</HI>'s Rise,</L>
<L>What Morals teach it, and what Fables hide,</L>
<L>What Author wrote it, how that Author dy'd,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>All these I sing. In <HI>Greece</HI> they fram'd the Tale</L>
<L>(In <HI>Greece,</HI> 'twas thought, a <HI>Woman</HI> might be frail)</L>
<L>Ye modern Beauties! where the Poet drew</L>
<L>His softest Pencil, think he dreamt of you;</L>
<L>And warn'd by him, ye wanton Pens, beware</L>
<L>How Heav'n's concern'd to vindicate the Fair.</L>
<L>The Case was <HI>Hesiod</HI>'s; he the Fable writ;</L>
<L>Some think with Meaning, some with idle Wit:</L>
<L>Perhaps 'tis either, as the Ladies please;</L>
<L>I wave the Contest, and commence the Lays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In days of yore, (no matter where or when,</L>
<L>'Twas e're the low Creation swarm'd with Men)</L>
<L>That one <HI>Prometheus,</HI> sprung of heav'nly Birth,</L>
<L>(Our Author's Song can witness) liv'd on Earth.</L>
<L>He carv'd the Turf to mold a manly Frame,</L>
<L>And stole from <HI>Jove</HI> his animating Flame.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>The sly Contrivance o'er <HI>Olympus</HI> ran,</L>
<L>When thus the Monarch of the Stars began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh vers'd in Arts! whose daring Thoughts aspire</L>
<L>To kindle Clay with never-dying Fire!</L>
<L>Enjoy thy Glory past, That Gift was thine;</L>
<L>The next thy Creature meets, be fairly mine:</L>
<L>And such a Gift, a Vengeance so design'd,</L>
<L>As suits the Counsel of a God to find;</L>
<L>A pleasing Bosom-cheat, a specious Ill,</L>
<L>Which felt they curse, yet covet still to feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said, and <HI>Vulcan</HI> strait the Sire commands,</L>
<L>To temper Mortar with etherial Hands;</L>
<L>In such a Shape to mold a rising Fair,</L>
<L>As Virgin-goddesses are proud to wear;</L>
<L>To make her Eyes with Diamond-water shine,</L>
<L>And form her Organs for a Voice divine.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>'Twas thus the Sire ordain'd; the Pow'r obey'd;</L>
<L>And work'd, and wonder'd at the Work he made;</L>
<L>The fairest, softest, sweetest Frame beneath,</L>
<L>Now made to seem, now more than seem, to breathe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As <HI>Vulcan</HI> ends, the chearful <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Charms</HI></L>
<L>Clasp'd the new-panting Creature in her Arms;</L>
<L>From that Embrace a fine Complexion spread,</L>
<L>Where mingled Whiteness glow'd with softer red.</L>
<L>Then in a Kiss she breath'd her various Arts,</L>
<L>Of trifling prettily with wounded Hearts;</L>
<L>A Mind for Love, but still a changing Mind;</L>
<L>The Lisp affected, and the Glance design'd;</L>
<L>The sweet confusing Blush, the secret Wink,</L>
<L>The gentle-swimming Walk, the courteous Sink,</L>
<L>The Stare for Strangeness fit, for Scorn the Frown,</L>
<L>For decent yielding Looks declining down,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>The practis'd Languish, where well-feign'd Desire</L>
<L>Wou'd own its melting in a mutual Fire;</L>
<L>Gay Smiles to comfort; <HI>April</HI> Show'rs to move;</L>
<L>And all the Nature, all the Art, of Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gold-scepter'd <HI>Juno</HI> next exalts the Fair;</L>
<L>Her Touch endows her with imperious Air,</L>
<L>Self-valuing Fancy, highly-crested Pride,</L>
<L>Strong sov'reign Will, and <HI>some</HI> Desire to chide:</L>
<L>For which, an Eloquence, that aims to vex,</L>
<L>With native Tropes of Anger, arms the Sex.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Minerva</HI> (skillful Goddess) train'd the Maid</L>
<L>To twirl the Spindle by the twisting Thread,</L>
<L>To fix the Loom, instruct the Reeds to part,</L>
<L>Cross the long Weft, and close the Web with Art,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="12"/>An useful Gift; but what profuse Expence,</L>
<L>What world of Fashions, took its Rise from hence!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young <HI>Hermes</HI> next, a close-contriving God,</L>
<L>Her Brows encircled with his Serpent Rod:</L>
<L>Then Plots and fair Excuses, fill'd her Brain,</L>
<L>The Views of breaking am'rous Vows for Gain,</L>
<L>The Price of Favours; the designing Arts</L>
<L>That aim at Riches in Contempt of Hearts;</L>
<L>And for a Comfort in the Marriage Life,</L>
<L>The little, pilf'ring Temper of a <HI>Wife.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full on the Fair his Beams <HI>Apollo</HI> flung,</L>
<L>And fond Persuasion tip'd her easy Tongue;</L>
<L>He gave her Words, where oyly Flatt'ry lays</L>
<L>The pleasing Colours of the Art of Praise;</L>
<L>And Wit, to Scandal exquisitely prone,</L>
<L>Which frets another's Spleen to cure its own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<L>Those sacred <HI>Virgins</HI> whom the Bards revere,</L>
<L>Tun'd all her Voice, and shed a Sweetness there,</L>
<L>To make her Sense with double Charms abound,</L>
<L>Or make her lively Nonsense please by Sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To dress the Maid, the decent <HI>Graces</HI> brought</L>
<L>A Robe in all the Dies of Beauty wrought,</L>
<L>And plac'd their Boxes o'er a rich Brocade</L>
<L>Where pictur'd <HI>Loves</HI> on ev'ry cover plaid;</L>
<L>Then spread those Implements that <HI>Vulcan</HI>'s Art</L>
<L>Had fram'd to merit <HI>Cytherea</HI>'s Heart;</L>
<L>The Wire to curl, the close-indented Comb</L>
<L>To call the Locks that lightly wander, home;</L>
<L>And chief, the Mirrour, where the ravish'd Maid</L>
<L>Beholds and loves her own reflected Shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair <HI>Flora</HI> lent her Stores, the purpled <HI>Hours</HI></L>
<L>Confin'd her Tresses with a Wreath of Flow'rs;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="14"/>Within the Wreath arose a radiant Crown;</L>
<L>A Veil pellucid hung depending down;</L>
<L>Back roll'd her azure Veil with Serpent fold,</L>
<L>The purfled Border deck'd the Floor with Gold.</L>
<L>Her Robe (which closely by the Girdle brac't</L>
<L>Reveal'd the Beauties of a slender Waste)</L>
<L>Flow'd to the Feet; to copy <HI>Venus</HI> Air,</L>
<L>When <HI>Venus</HI>'s Statues have a Robe to wear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The new sprung Creature finish'd thus for Harms,</L>
<L>Adjusts her Habit, practises her Charms;</L>
<L>With Blushes glows, or shines with lively Smiles,</L>
<L>Confirms her Will, or recollects her Wiles:</L>
<L>Then conscious of her Worth, with easy Pace</L>
<L>Glides by the Glass, and turning views her Face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A finer Flax than what they wrought before,</L>
<L>Thro' Time's deep Cave the <HI>Sister Fates</HI> explore,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="15"/>Then fix the Loom, their Fingers nimbly weave,</L>
<L>And thus their Toil prophetick Songs deceive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Flow from the Rock my Flax! and swiftly flow,</L>
<L>Pursue thy Thread; the Spindle runs below.</L>
<L>A Creature fond and changing, fair and vain,</L>
<L>The Creature <HI>Woman,</HI> rises now to reign.</L>
<L>New Beauty blooms, a Beauty form'd to fly;</L>
<L>New Love begins, a Love produc'd to dye;</L>
<L>New Parts distress the troubled Scenes of Life,</L>
<L>The fondling Mistress, and the ruling Wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Men, born to Labour, all with Pains provide;</L>
<L><HI>Women</HI> have Time, to sacrifice to Pride:</L>
<L>They want the Care of Man, their Want they know,</L>
<L>And dress to please with heart-alluring Show,</L>
<L>The Show prevailing, for the Sway contend,</L>
<L>And make a Servant where they meet a Friend.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<L>Thus in a thousand wax-erected Forts</L>
<L>A loytering Race the painful Bee supports,</L>
<L>From Sun to Sun, from Bank to Bank he flies,</L>
<L>With Honey loads his Bag, with Wax his Thighs,</L>
<L>Fly where he will, at home the Race remain,</L>
<L>Prune the silk Dress, and murm'ring eat the Gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet here and there we grant a gentle Bride,</L>
<L>Whose Temper betters by the Father's side;</L>
<L>Unlike the rest that double humane Care,</L>
<L>Fond to relieve, or resolute to share:</L>
<L>Happy the Man whom thus his Stars advance!</L>
<L>The Curse is gen'ral, but the Blessing Chance.</L>

<L>With wafting Airs the Winds obsequious blow,</L>
<L>And land the shining Vengeance safe below.</L>
<L>A golden Coffer in her Hand she bore,</L>

<L>'Twas fraught with Pangs; for <HI>Jove</HI> ordain'd above,</L>
<L>That Gold shou'd aid, and Pangs attend on Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her gay Descent the Man perceiv'd afar,</L>
<L>Wond'ring he run to catch the falling Star;</L>
<L>But so surpriz'd, as none but he can tell,</L>
<L>Who lov'd so quickly, and who lov'd so well.</L>
<L>O'er all his Veins the wand'ring Passion burns,</L>
<L>He calls her Nymph, and ev'ry Nymph by turns.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="18"/>Her Form to lovely <HI>Venus</HI> he prefers,</L>
<L>Or swears that <HI>Venus</HI> must be such as hers.</L>

<L>Neglects his Offers while her Airs she plays,</L>
<L>Shoots scornful Glances from the bended Frown,</L>
<L>In brisk Disorder trips it up and down,</L>
<L>Then hums a careless Tune to lay the Storm,</L>
<L>And sits, and blushes, smiles, and yields, in <HI>Form.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>"Now take what <HI>Jove</HI> design'd (she softly cry'd)</L>
<L>"This box thy Portion, and my self thy Bride:"</L>
<L>Fir'd with the Prospect of the double Charms,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unhappy Man! to whom so bright she shone,</L>
<L>The fatal Gift, her tempting self, unknown!</L>
<L>The Winds were silent, all the Waves asleep,</L>

<L>For him the Nymphs in blue forsook the Floods,</L>

<L>The silent Heart which Grief assails,</L>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> HERMIT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAR in a Wild, unknown to publick View,</L>
<L>From Youth to Age a rev'rend <HI>Hermit</HI> grew;</L>
<L>The Moss his Bed, the Cave his humble Cell,</L>
<L>His Food the Fruits, his Drink the chrystal Well:</L>
<L>Remote from Man, with God he pass'd the Days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all his Bus'ness, all his Pleasure Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Life so sacred, such serene Repose,</L>
<L>Seem'd Heav'n it self, 'till one Suggestion rose;</L>
<L>That Vice shou'd triumph, Virtue Vice obey,</L>
<L>This sprung some Doubt of Providence's Sway:</L>
<L><PB N="165" REF="170"/>His Hopes no more a certain Prospect boast,</L>
<L>And all the Tenour of his Soul is lost:</L>
<L>So when a smooth Expanse receives imprest</L>
<L>Calm Nature's Image on its wat'ry Breast,</L>
<L>Down bend the Banks, the Trees depending grow,</L>
<L>And Skies beneath with answ'ring Colours glow:</L>
<L>But if a Stone the gentle Scene divide,</L>
<L>Swift ruffling Circles curl on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>And glimmering Fragments of a broken Sun,</L>
<L>Banks, Trees, and Skies, in thick Disorder run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To clear this Doubt, to know the World by Sight,</L>
<L>To find if Books, or Swains, report it right;</L>
<L>(For yet by Swains alone the World he knew,</L>
<L>Whose Feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly Dew)</L>
<L>He quits his Cell; the Pilgrim-Staff he bore,</L>
<L>And fix'd the Scallop in his Hat before;</L>
<L><PB N="166" REF="171"/>Then with the Sun a rising Journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each Event.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Morn was wasted in the pathless Grass,</L>
<L>And long and lonesome was the Wild to pass;</L>
<L>But when the <HI>Southern</HI> Sun had warm'd the Day,</L>
<L>A Youth came posting o'er a crossing Way;</L>
<L>His Rayment decent, his Complexion fair,</L>
<L>And soft in graceful Ringlets wav'd his Hair.</L>
<L>Then near approaching, Father Hail! he cry'd,</L>
<L>And Hail, my Son, the rev'rend Sire reply'd;</L>
<L>Words followed Words, from Question Answer flow'd</L>
<L>And Talk of various kind deceiv'd the Road;</L>
<L>'Till each with other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their Age they differ; joyn in Heart:</L>
<L>Thus stands an aged Elm in Ivy bound,</L>
<L>Thus youthful Ivy clasps an Elm around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="167" REF="172"/>
<L>Now sunk the Sun; the closing Hour of Day</L>
<L>Came onward, mantled o'er with sober gray;</L>
<L>Nature in silence bid the World repose:</L>
<L>When near the Road a stately Palace rose:</L>
<L>There by the Moon thro' Ranks of Trees they pass,</L>
<L>Whose Verdure crown'd their sloping sides of Grass.</L>
<L>It chanc't the noble Master of the Dome,</L>
<L>Still made his House the wand'ring Stranger's home:</L>
<L>Yet still the Kindness, from a Thirst of Praise,</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain Flourish of expensive Ease.</L>
<L>The Pair arrive: the Liv'ry'd Servants wait;</L>
<L>Their Lord receives them at the pompous Gate.</L>
<L>The Table groans with costly Piles of Food,</L>
<L>And all is more than Hospitably good.</L>
<L>Then led to rest, the Day's long Toil they drown,</L>
<L>Deep sunk in Sleep, and Silk, and Heaps of Down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
<L>At length 'tis Morn, and at the Dawn of Day,</L>
<L>Along the wide Canals the <HI>Zephyrs</HI> play;</L>
<L>Fresh o'er the gay Parterres the Breezes creep,</L>
<L>And shake the neighb'ring Wood to banish Sleep.</L>
<L>Up rise the Guests, obedient to the Call,</L>
<L>'An early Banquet deck'd the splendid Hall;</L>
<L>Rich luscious Wine a golden Goblet grac't,</L>
<L>Which the kind Master forc'd the Guests to taste.</L>
<L>Then pleas'd and thankful, from the Porch they go,</L>
<L>And, but the Landlord, none had cause of Woe;</L>
<L>His <HI>Cup</HI> was vanish'd; for in secret Guise</L>
<L>The younger Guest purloin'd the glittering Prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As one who 'spys a Serpent in his Way,</L>
<L>Glistning and basking in the Summer Ray,</L>
<L>Disorder'd stops to shun the Danger near,</L>
<L>Then walks with Faintness on, and looks with Fear:</L>
<L><PB N="169" REF="174"/>So seem'd the Sire; when far upon the Road,</L>
<L>The shining Spoil his wiley Partner show'd.</L>
<L>He stopp'd with Silence, walk'd with trembling Heart,</L>
<L>And much he wish'd, but durst not ask to part:</L>
<L>Murm'ring he lifts his Eyes, and thinks it hard,</L>
<L>That generous Actions meet a base Reward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus they pass, the Sun his Glory shrouds,</L>
<L>The changing Skies hang out their sable Clouds;</L>
<L>A Sound in Air presag'd approaching Rain,</L>
<L>And Beasts to covert scud a cross the Plain.</L>
<L>Warn'd by the Signs, the wand'ring Pair retreat,</L>
<L>To seek for Shelter at a neighb'ring Seat.</L>
<L>'Twas built with Turrets, on a rising Ground,</L>
<L>And strong, and large, and unimprov'd around;</L>
<L>Its Owner's Temper, tim'rous and severe,</L>
<L>Unkind and griping, caus'd a Desert there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
<L>As near the <HI>Miser</HI>'s heavy Doors they drew,</L>
<L>Fierce rising Gusts with sudden Fury blew;</L>
<L>The nimble Light'ning mix'd with Show'rs began,</L>
<L>And o'er their Heads loud-rolling Thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the Wind, and battered by the Rain.</L>
<L>At length some Pity warm'd the Master's Breast,</L>
<L>('Twas then, his Threshold first receiv'd a Guest)</L>
<L>Slow creaking turns the Door with jealous Care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the shivering Pair;</L>
<L>One frugal Faggot lights the naked Walls,</L>
<L>And Nature's Fervor thro' their Limbs recals:</L>
<L>Bread of the coursest sort, with eager Wine,</L>
<L>(Each hardly granted) serv'd them both to dine;</L>
<L>And when the Tempest first appear'd to cease,</L>
<L>A ready Warning bid them part in Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
<L>With still Remark the pond'ring <HI>Hermit</HI> view'd</L>
<L>In one so rich, a Life so poor and rude;</L>
<L>And why shou'd such, (within himself he cry'd,)</L>
<L>Lock the lost Wealth a thousand want beside?</L>
<L>But what new Marks of Wonder soon took place,</L>
<L>In ev'ry settling Feature of his Face!</L>
<L>When from his Vest the young Companion bore</L>
<L>That <HI>Cup,</HI> the gen'rous Landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid profusely with the precious Bowl</L>
<L>The stinted Kindness of this churlish Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now the Clouds in airy Tumult fly,</L>
<L>The Sun emerging opes an azure Sky;</L>
<L>A fresher green the smelling Leaves display,</L>
<L>And glitt'ring as they tremble, cheer the Day:</L>
<L>The Weather courts them from the poor Retreat,</L>
<L>And the glad Master bolts the wary Gate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>
<L>While hence they walk, the <HI>Pilgrim</HI>'s Bosom wrought,</L>
<L>With all the Travel of uncertain Thought;</L>
<L>His Partner's Acts without their Cause appear,</L>
<L>'Twas there a Vice, and seem'd a Madness here:</L>
<L>Detesting that, and pitying this he goes,</L>
<L>Lost and confounded with the various Shows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Night's dim Shades again involve the Sky;</L>
<L>Again the Wand'rers want a Place to lye,</L>
<L>Again they search, and find a Lodging nigh.</L>
<L>The Soil improv'd around, the Mansion neat,</L>
<L>And neither poorly low, nor idly great:</L>
<L>It seem'd to speak its Master's turn of Mind,</L>
<L>Content, and not for Praise, but Virtue kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="173" REF="178"/>
<L>Hither the Walkers turn with weary Feet</L>
<L>Then bless the Mansion, and the Master greet:</L>
<L>Their greeting fair bestow'd, with modest Guise,</L>
<L>The courteous Master hears, and thus replies:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Without a vain, without a grudging Heart,</L>
<L>To Him who gives us all, I yield a part;</L>
<L>From Him you come, for Him accept it here,</L>
<L>A frank and sober, more than costly Cheer.</L>
<L>He spoke, and bid the welcome Table spread,</L>
<L>Then talk'd of Virtue till the time of Bed,</L>
<L>When the grave Houshold round his Hall repair,</L>
<L>Warn'd by a Bell, and close the Hours with Pray'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the World renew'd by calm Repose</L>
<L>Was strong for Toil, the dappled Morn arose;</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="179"/>Before the Pilgrims part, the Younger crept,</L>
<L>Near the clos'd Cradle where an Infant slept,</L>
<L>And writh'd his Neck: the Landlord's little Pride,</L>
<L>Ostrange Return! grew black, and gasp'd, and dy'd.</L>
<L>Horrour of Horrours! what! his only Son!</L>
<L>How look'd our Hermit when the Fact was done?</L>
<L>Not Hell, tho' Hell's black Jaws in sunder part,</L>
<L>And breathe blue Fire, cou'd more assault his Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Confus'd, and struck with Silence at the Deed,</L>
<L>He flies, but trembling fails to fly with Speed.</L>
<L>His Steps the Youth pursues; the Country lay</L>
<L>Perplex'd with Roads, a Servant show'd the Way:</L>
<L>A River cross'd the Path; the Passage o'er</L>
<L>Was nice to find; the Servant trod before;</L>
<L>Long arms of Oaks an open Bridge supply'd,</L>
<L>And deep the Waves beneath the bending glide.</L>
<L><PB N="175" REF="180"/>The Youth, who seem'd to watch a Time to sin,</L>
<L>Approach'd the careless Guide, and thrust him in;</L>
<L>Plunging he falls, and rising lifts his Head,</L>
<L>Then flashing turns, and sinks among the Dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wild, sparkling Rage inflames the Father's Eyes,</L>
<L>He bursts the Bands of Fear, and madly cries,</L>
<L>Detested Wretchâ€” But scarce his Speech began,</L>
<L>When the strange Partner seem'd no longer Man:</L>
<L>His youthful Face grew more serenely sweet;</L>
<L>His Robe turn'd white, and flow'd upon his Feet;</L>
<L>Fair rounds of radiant Points invest his Hair;</L>
<L>Celestial Odours breathe thro' purpled Air;</L>
<L>And Wings, whose Colours glitter'd on the Day,</L>
<L>Wide at his Back their gradual Plumes display.</L>
<L>The Form Etherial bursts upon his Sight,</L>
<L>And moves in all the Majesty of Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="176" REF="181"/>
<L>Tho' loud at first the Pilgrim's Passion grew,</L>
<L>Sudden he gaz'd, and wist not what to do;</L>
<L>Surprize in secret Chains his words suspends,</L>
<L>And in a Calm his settling Temper ends.</L>
<L>But Silence here the beauteous Angel broke,</L>
<L>(The Voice of Musick ravish'd as he spoke)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy Pray'r, thy Praise, thy Life to Vice unâˆ£known,</L>
<L>In sweet Memorial rise before the Throne:</L>
<L>These Charms, Success in our bright Region find,</L>
<L>And force an Angel down, to calm thy Mind;</L>
<L>For this commission'd, I forsook the Sky,</L>
<L>Nay, cease to kneelâ€” Thy fellow Servant I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then know the Truth of Government Divine,</L>
<L>And let these Scruples be no longer thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="177" REF="182"/>
<L>The Maker justly claims that World he made,</L>
<L>In this the Right of Providence is laid;</L>
<L>Its sacred Majesty thro' all depends</L>
<L>On using second Means to work his Ends:</L>
<L>'Tis thus, withdrawn in State from human Eye,</L>
<L>The Pow'r exerts his Attributes on high,</L>
<L>Your Actions uses, not controuls your Will,</L>
<L>And bids the doubting Sons of Men be still.</L>

<L>Yet taught by these, confess th' Almighty Just,</L>
<L>And where you can't unriddle, learn to trust!</L>

<L>Whose Life was too luxurious to be good;</L>
<L><PB N="178" REF="183"/>Who made his Iv'ry Stands with Goblets shine,</L>
<L>And forc'd his Guests to morning Draughts of Wine,</L>

<Q>Decipimur Specie Rectiâ€”

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR Defects and Follies are too often unâˆ£known to us; nay, they are so far from being known to us, that they pass for Demonstraâˆ£tions of our Worth. This makes us easie in the midst of them, fond to shew them, fond to imâˆ£prove in them, and to be esteemed for them. Then it is that a thousand unaccountable Conceits, gay Inventions, and extravagant Actions must afâˆ£ford us Pleasures, and display us to others in the Colours which we our selves take a Fancy to gloâˆ£ry in: And indeed there is something so amusing for the Time in this State of Vanity and ill-groundâˆ£ed
<PB N="184" REF="188"/>Satisfaction, that even the wiser World has chosen an exalted Word to describe its Enchantâˆ£ments, and called it <HI>the Paradise of Fools.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the latter Part of this Reflection may seem a false Thought to some, and bear another Turn than what I have given; but it is at present none of my Business to look after it, who am goâˆ£ing to confess that I have been lately amongst them in a Vision.</P>
<P>Methought I was transported to a Hill, green, flowery, and of an easy Ascent. Upon the broad Top of it resided squint-eyed <HI>Errour,</HI> and popuâˆ£lar <HI>Opinion</HI> with many Heads; two that dealt in Sorcery, and were famous for bewitching People with the Love of themselves. To these repaired a Multitude from every Side, by two different Paths which lead towards each of them. Some who had the most assuming Air went directly of themselves to <HI>Errour,</HI> without expecting a Conâˆ£ductor; others of a softer Nature went first to popular <HI>Opinion,</HI> from whence as she influenced and engaged them with their own Praises, she deâˆ£livered them over to his Government.</P>
<P>When we had ascended to an open Part of the Summit where <HI>Opinion</HI> abode, we found her enâˆ£tertaining several who had arrived before us. Her Voice was pleasing; she breathed Odours as she spoke: She seemed to have a Tongue for every one;
<PB N="185" REF="189"/>every one thought he heard of something that was valuable in himself, and expected a Paradise which she promised as the Reward of his Merit. Thus were we drawn to follow her, till she should bring us where it was to be bestowed: And it was observable, that all the Way we went, the Comâˆ£pany was either praising themselves in their Qualiâˆ£fications, or one another for those Qualifications which they took to be conspicuous in their own Characters, or dispraising others for wanting theirs, or vying in the Degrees of them.</P>
<P>At last we approached a Bower, at the Entrance of which <HI>Errour</HI> was seated. The Trees were thick-woven, and the Place where he sat artfully contrived to darken him a little. He was disguiâˆ£sed in a whitish Robe, which he had put on, that he might appear to us with a nearer Resemâˆ£blance to <HI>Truth:</HI> And as she has a Light whereby she manifests the Beauties of Nature to the Eyes of her Adorers, so he had provided himself with a magical Wand, that he might do something in Imitation of it, and please with Delusions. This he lifted solemnly, and muttering to himself, bid the Glories which he kept under Enchantment to appear before us. Immediately we cast our Eyes on that part of the Sky to which he pointed, and observed a thin blue Prospect, which cleared as Mountains in a Summer Morning when the Mists go off, and the Palace of <HI>Vanity</HI> appeared to Sight.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="190"/>The Foundation hardly seemed a Foundation, but a Set of curling Clouds, which it stood upon by magical Contrivance. The Way by which we ascended was painted like a Rainbow; and as we went the Breeze that played about us bewitchâˆ£ed the Senses. The Walls were gilded all for Show; the lowest Set of Pillars were of the slight Fine <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, and the Top of the Building being rounded, bore so far the Resemâˆ£blance of a Bubble.</P>
<P>At the Gate the Travellers neither met with a Porter, nor waited till one should appear; every one thought his Merits a sufficient Passport, and pressed forward. In the Hall we met with several Phantoms, that rov'd amongst us, and rang'd the Company according to their Sentiments. There was decreasing <HI>Honour,</HI> that had nothing to shew in but an old Coat of his Ancestors Atchievements: There was <HI>Ostentation,</HI> that made himself his own constant Subject, and <HI>Gallantry</HI> strutting upâˆ£on his Tip-toes. At the upper end of the Hall stood a Throne, whose Canopy glitter'd with all the Riches that Gayety could contrive to lavish on it; and between the gilded Arms sat <HI>Vanity</HI> deck'd in the Peacock's Feathers, and acknowledged for another <HI>Venus</HI> by her Votaries. The Boy who stood beside her for a <HI>Cupid,</HI> and who made the World to bow before her, was called <HI>Self-Conceit.</HI> His Eyes had every now and then a Cast in wards,
<PB N="187" REF="191"/>to the Neglect of all Objects about him; and the Arms which he made use of for Conquest, were borrowed from those against whom he had a Deâˆ£sign. The Arrow which he shot at the Soldier, was fledg'd from his own Plume of Feathers; the Dart he directed against the Man of Wit, was winged from the Quills he writ with; and that which he sent against those who presumed upon their Riches, was headed with Gold out of their Treasuries: He made Nets for Statesmen from their own Contrivances; he took Fire from the Eyes of Ladies, with which he melted their Hearts; and Lightning from the Tongues of the Eloquent, to enflame them with their own Glories. At the Foot of the Throne sat three false Graces. <HI>Flattery</HI> with a Shell of Paint, <HI>Affectation</HI> with a Mirrour to practise at, and <HI>Fashion</HI> ever changâˆ£ing the Posture of her Cloaths. These applied themselves to secure the Conquests which <HI>Self-Conceit</HI> had gotten, and had each of them their particular Polities. <HI>Flattery</HI> gave new Colours and Complexions to all Things, <HI>Affectation</HI> new Airs and Appearances, which, as she said, were not vulgar, and <HI>Fashion</HI> both concealed some home Defects, and added some foreign external Beauties.</P>
<P>As I was reflecting upon what I saw, I heard a Voice in the Crowd, bemoaning the Condition of Mankind, which is thus managed by the Breath of <HI>Opinion,</HI> deluded by <HI>Errour,</HI> fir'd by <HI>Self-Conâˆ£ceit,</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="192"/>and given up to be trained in all the Courses of <HI>Vanity,</HI> till <HI>Scorn</HI> or <HI>Poverty</HI> come upon us. These Expressions were no sooner handed about, but I immediately saw a general Disorder, till at last there was a Parting in one Place, and a grave old Man decent and resolute, was led forward to be punished for the Words he had uttered. He appeared inclined to have spoken in his own Deâˆ£fence, but I could not observe that any one was willing to hear him. <HI>Vanity</HI> cast a scornful Smile at him; <HI>Self Conceit</HI> was angry; <HI>Flattery,</HI> who knew him for <HI>Plain-dealing,</HI> put on a <HI>Vizard,</HI> and turned away; <HI>Affectation</HI> tossed her Fan, made Mouths, and called him <HI>Envy</HI> or <HI>Slander;</HI> and <HI>Fashion</HI> would have it, that at least he must be <HI>Ill-Manners.</HI> Thus slighted and despised by all, he was driven out for abusing People of Meâˆ£rit and Figure; and I heard it firmly resolved, that he should be used no better where-ever they met with him hereafter.</P>
<P>I had already seen the meaning of most part of that Warning which he had given, and was conâˆ£sidering how the latter Words should be fulfilled, when a mighty Noise was heard without, and the Door was blackned by a numerous Train of Harâˆ£pies crowding in upon us. <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Broken Creâˆ£dit</HI> were seen in the House before they entered. <HI>Trouble, Shame, Infamy, Scorn</HI> and <HI>Poverty</HI> brought up the Rear. <HI>Vanity,</HI> with her <HI>Cupid</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> disappeared; her Subjects ran into
<PB N="189" REF="193"/>Holes and Corners; but many of them were found and carried off (as I was told by one who stood near me) either to Prisons or Cellars, Soliâˆ£tude, or little Company, the mean Arts or the viler Crafts, of Life. But these, added he with a disdainful Air, are such who would fondâˆ£ly live here, when their Merits neither matched the Lustre of the Place, nor their Riches its Expences. We have seen such Scenes as these before now; the Glory you saw will all return when the Hurry is over. I thank'd him for his Information, and believing him so incorrigible as that he would stay till it was his Turn to be taken, I made off to the Door, and overtook some few, who, though they would not hearkâˆ£en to <HI>Plain-dealing,</HI> were now terrified to good purpose by the Example of others: But when they had touched the Threshold, it was a strange shock to them to find that the Delusion of <HI>Erâˆ£rour</HI> was gone, and they plainly discerned the Building to hang a little up in the Air without any real Foundation. At first we saw nothing but a desperate Leap remained for us, and I a thousand times blamed my unmeaning Curiosiâˆ£ty that had brought me into so much Danger. But as they began to sink lower in their own Minds, methought the Palace sunk along with us, till they were arrived at the due Point of <HI>Esteem</HI> which they ought to have for themâˆ£selves; then the Part of the Building in which they stood touched the Earth, and we departâˆ£ing
<PB N="190" REF="194"/>out, it retired from our Eyes. Now, whether they who stayed in the Palace were sensible of this Descent, I cannot tell; it was then my Opinion that they were not. Howâˆ£ever it be, my Dream broke up at it, and has given me Occasion all my Life to reflect upon the fatal Consequences of following the Sugâˆ£gestions of <HI>Vanity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>VISION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SPECTATOR. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 501.</HEAD>
<P>HOW are we tortured with the Absence of what we covet to possess, when it apâˆ£pears to be lost to us! What Excursions does the Soul make in Imagination after it! and how does it turn into it self again, more foolishly fond and dejected, at the Disappointment! Our Grief, inâˆ£stead of having Recourse to Reason, which might restrain it, searches to find a further Nouâˆ£rishment. It calls upon Memory to relate the several Passages and Circumstances of Satisfactions which we formerly enjoyed; the Pleasures we
<PB N="192" REF="196"/>purchased by those Riches that are taken from us; or the Power and Splendour of our departed Hoâˆ£nours; or the Voice, the Words, the Looks, the Temper, and Affections of our Friends that are deceased. It needs must happen from hence, that the Passion should often swell to such a Size as to burst the Heart which contains it, if Time did not make these Circumstances less strong and lively, so that Reason should become a more eâˆ£qual Match for the Passion, or if another Desire which becomes more present did not overpower them with a livelier Representation. These are Thoughts which I had, when I fell into a kind of Vision upon this Subject, and may therefore stand for a proper Introduction to a Relation of it.</P>
<P>I found my self upon a naked Shore, with Company whose afflicted Countenances witnessed their Conditions. Before us flowed a Water deep, silent, and called the River of <HI>Tears,</HI> which issuing from two Fountains on an upper Ground, encompassed an Island that lay before us. The Boat which plied in it was old and shattered, having been sometimes overset by the Impatience and Haste of single Passengers to arâˆ£rive at the other side. This immediately was brought to us by <HI>Misfortune</HI> who steers it, and we were all preparing to take our Places, when there appeared a Woman of a mild and composed Behaviour, who began to deter us from it, by representing the Dangers which would attend our
<PB N="193" REF="197"/>Voyage. Hereupon some who knew her for <HI>Patience,</HI> and some of those too who till then cry'd the loudest, were persuaded by her, and reâˆ£turn'd back. The rest of us went in, and she (whose Good-nature would not suffer her to forâˆ£sake Persons in Trouble) desired Leave to accomâˆ£pany us, that she might at least administer some small Comfort or Advice while we sailed. We were no sooner embarked but the Boat, was pushâˆ£ed off, the Sheet was spread; and being filled with <HI>Sighs,</HI> which are the Winds of that Counâˆ£try, we made a Passage to the farther Bank thro' several Difficulties of which the most of us seem'd utterly regardless.</P>
<P>When we landed, we perceived the Island to be strangely over-cast with Fogs, which no Brightâˆ£ness could pierce, so that a kind of gloomy Horâˆ£ror sat always brooding over it. This had someâˆ£thing in it very shocking to easy Tempers, insoâˆ£much that some others, whom <HI>Patience</HI> had by this time gain'd over, left us here, and privily convey'd themselves round the Verge of the Island to find a Ford by which she told them they might escape.</P>
<P>For my part, I still went along with those who were for piercing into the Centre of the Place; and joining our selves to others whom we found upon the same Journey, we marched soâˆ£lemnly as at a Funeral, thro' bordering Hedges
<PB N="194" REF="198"/>of Rosemary, and thro' a Grove of Yew-Trees, which love to over-shadow Tombs and flourish in Church-Yards. Here we heard on every side the Wailings and Complaints of several of the Inhabitants, who had cast themselves disconsoâˆ£lately at the Feet of Trees; and as we chanc'd to approach any of these, we might perceive them wringing their Hands, beating their Breasts, tearâˆ£ing their Hair, or after some other manner visibly agitated with Vexation. Our Sorrows were heightned by the Influence of what we heard and saw, and one of our Number was wrought up to such a Pitch of Wildness, as to talk of hanging himself upon a Bough which shot temptingly aâˆ£cross the Path we travelled in; but he was reâˆ£strain'd from it by the kind Endeavours of our abovementioned Companion.</P>
<P>We had now gotten into the most dusky silent Part of the Island, and by the redoubled Sounds of Sighs, which made a doleful whistling in the Branches, the Thickness of Air which occasioned faintish Respiration, and the violent Throbbings of Heart which more and more affected us, we found that we approach'd the <HI>Grotto of Grief.</HI> It was a wide, hollow, and melancholy Cave, sunk deep in a Dale, and watered by Rivulets that had a Colour between Red and Black. These crept slow, and half congealed amongst its Windâˆ£ings, and mixed their heavy Murmur with the Eâˆ£cho of Groans that rolled thro' all the Passages.
<PB N="195" REF="199"/>In the most retired part of it sat the <HI>doleful Beâˆ£ing</HI> her self; the Path to her was strewed with Goads, Stings, and Thorns; and the Throne on which she sat was broken into a Rock with ragged Pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon. A heavy Mist hung above her, her Head oppressed with it reclined upon her Arm: Thus did she reign over her disconsolate Subjects, full of her self to Stupidity, in eternal Pensiveness, and the profoundest Silence. On one side of her stood <HI>Dejection</HI> just dropping into a Swoon, and <HI>Paleâˆ£ness</HI> wasting to a Skeleton; on the other side were <HI>Care</HI> inwardly tormented with Imaginations, and <HI>Anguish</HI> suffering outward <HI>Troubles</HI> to suck the Blood from her Heart in the Shape of <HI>Vultures.</HI> The whole Vault had a genuine Dismalness in it, which a few scattered Lamps, whose blueish Flames arose and sunk in their Urns, discovered to our Eyes with Encrease. Some of us fell down, overcome and spent with what they sufferâˆ£ed in the way, and were given over to those Torâˆ£mentors that stood on either Hand of the Preâˆ£sence; others, galled and mortified with Pain, recover'd the Entrance, where <HI>Patience,</HI> whom we had left behind, was still waiting to receive us.</P>
<P>With her (whose Company was now become more grateful to us by the want we had found of her) we winded round the Grotto, and ascended at the Back of it, out of the mournful Dale in
<PB N="196" REF="200"/>whose Bottom it lay. On this Eminence we halted, by her Advice, to pant for Breath; and lifting our Eyes, which till then were fixed downâˆ£wards, felt a sullen sort of Satisfaction, in obserâˆ£ving thro' the Shades what Numbers had entred the Island. This Satisfaction, which appears to have Ill-nature in it, was excusable, because it happened at a time when we were too much taken up with our own Concern, to have Respect to that of others; and therefore we did not consider them as suffering, but our selves as not suffering in the most forlorn Estate. It had also the Groundâˆ£work of Humanity and Compassion in it, though the Mind was then too deeply engaged to perceive it; but as we proceeded onwards it began to discover it self, and from observing that others were unhapâˆ£py, we came to question one another, when it was that we met, and what were the sad Occasiâˆ£ons that brought us together. Then we heard our Stories, we compared them, we mutually gave and received Pity, and so by degrees became toâˆ£lerable Company.</P>
<P>A considerable Part of the troublesome Road was thus deceived; at length the Openings among the Trees grew larger, the Air seemed thinner, it lay with less Oppression upon us, and we could now and then discern Tracts in it of a lighter Greyness, like the Breakings of Day, short in Duration, much enlivening, and called in that Country <HI>Gleams of Amusement.</HI> Within a
<PB N="197" REF="201"/>short while these Gleams began to appear more frequent, and then brighter and of a longer Continuance; the <HI>Sighs</HI> that hitherto filled the Air with so much Dolefulness, altered to the Sound of common Breezes, and in general the Horrors of the Island were abated.</P>
<P>When we had arrived at last at the Ford by which we were to pass out, we met with those fashionable Mourners who had been ferâˆ£ried over along with us, and who being unâˆ£willing to go as far as we, had coasted by the Shore to find the Place, where they waited our coming; that by shewing themselves to the World only at that time when we did, they might seem also to have been among the trouâˆ£bles of the Grotto. Here the Waters, that rolled on the other side so deep and silent, were much dried up, and it was an easier Matâˆ£ter for us to wade over.</P>
<P>The River being crossed, we were received upon the further Bank by our Friends and Acquaintance, whom <HI>Comfort</HI> had brought out to congratulate our Appearance in the World again. Some of these blamed us for staying so long away from them, others advisâˆ£ed us against all Temptations of going back again; every one was cautious not to renew our Trouble, by asking any Particulars of the Journey; and all concluded, that in a Case
<PB N="198" REF="202"/>of so much Affliction, we could not have made choice of a fitter Companion than <HI>Patience.</HI> Here <HI>Patience,</HI> appearing seâˆ£rene at her Praises, delivered us over to <HI>Comâˆ£fort. Comfort</HI> smiled at his receiving the Charge; immediately the Sky purpled on that side to which he turned, and double Day at once broke in upon me.</P>

<P>I Was considering last Night, when I could not sleep, how noble a Part of the Creation Man was design'd to be, and how distinguished in all his Actions above other Earthly Creatures. From whence I fell to take a view of the Change and Corruption which he has introduced into his own Condition, the groveling Appetites, the mean Characters of Sense, and wild Courses of Passions, that cast him from the Degree in which Proviâˆ£dence had placed him, the debasing himself with Qualifications not his own, and his degenerating
<PB N="200" REF="204"/>into a lower Sphere of Action. This inspired me with a mixture of Contempt and Anger; which however, was not so violent as to hinder the Reâˆ£turn of Sleep, but grew confused as that came upon me, and made me end my Reflections with giving Mankind the opprobrious Names of Inconâˆ£siderate, Mad and Foolish.</P>
<P>Here methought, where my waking Reason left the Subject, my Fancy pursued it in a Dream; and I imagined my self in a loud Soliloquy of Passion, railing at my Species, and walking hard to get rid of the Company I despised; when two Men who had over-heard me made up on either hand. These I observed had many Features in common, which might occasion the Mistake of the one for the oâˆ£ther in those to whom they appear single, but I, who saw them together, could easily perceive, that tho' there was an Air of Severity in each, it was tempered with a natural Sweetness in the one, and by turns constrained or ruffled by the Designs of Malice in the other.</P>
<P>I was at a loss to know the Reason of their joining me so briskly, when he whose Appearâˆ£ance displeased me most, thus addressed his Comâˆ£panion. Pray, Brother, let him alone, and we shall immediately see him transformed into a Tyger. This struck me with Horror, which the other perceived, and pitying my Disorder, bid me be of good Courage, for tho' I had been Savage in my Treatment of Mankind, (whom I should raâˆ£ther
<PB N="201" REF="205"/>reform than rail against) he would, howâˆ£ever, endeavour to rescue me from my Danger. At this I looked a little more chearful, and while I testified my Resignation to him, we saw the anâˆ£gry Brother fling away from us in a Passion for his Disappointment. Being now left to my Friend, I went back with him at his Desire, that I might know the Meaning of those Words which so affrighted me.</P>
<P>As we went along, To inform you, says he, with whom you have this Adventure, my Name is <HI>Reproof</HI> and his <HI>Reproach,</HI> both born of the same Mother, but of different Fathers. <HI>Truth</HI> is our common Parent. <HI>Friendship,</HI> who saw her, fell in Love with her, and she being pleased with him, he begat me upon her; but a while afâˆ£ter <HI>Enmity</HI> lying in Ambush for her, became the Father of him whom you saw along with me. The Temper of our Mother enclines us to the same sort of Business, the informing Mankind of their Faults; but the differing Complexions of our Fathers make us differ in our Designs and Company. I have a natural Benevolence in my Mind which engages me with Friends, and he a natural Impetuosity in his, which casts him aâˆ£mong Enemies.</P>
<P>As he thus discoursed we came to a Place where there were three Entrances into as many several Walks, which lay beside one another. We
<PB N="202" REF="206"/>passed into the middlemost, a plain, strait, regular Walk, set with Trees, which added to the Beauâˆ£ty of the Place, but did not so close their Boughs over head as to exclude the Light from it. Here as we walked I was made to observe, how the Road on one hand was full of Rocks and Preciâˆ£pices, over which <HI>Reproach</HI> (who had already gotten thither) was furiously driving unhappy Wretches; the other side was all laid out in Garâˆ£dens of gaudy Tulips, amongst whose Leaves the Serpents wreath'd, and at the end of every grassy Walk the Enchantress <HI>Flattery</HI> was weaving Bowers to lull Souls asleep in. We continued still walking on the middle way, 'till we arrived in a Building in which it terminated. This was forâˆ£merly erected by <HI>Truth</HI> for a Watch Tower, from whence she took a View of the Earth, and, as she saw occasion, sent out <HI>Reproof,</HI> or even <HI>Reâˆ£proach,</HI> for our Reformation. Over the Door I took notice that a Face was carved with a Heart upon the Lips of it, and presently call'd to Mind that this was the Antients Emblem of <HI>Sincerity.</HI> In the Entrance I met with <HI>Freedom of Speech</HI> and <HI>Complaisance,</HI> who had for a long time lookâˆ£ed upon one another as Enemies; but <HI>Reproof</HI> has so happily brought them together, that they now act as Friends and Fellow-Agents in the same Faâˆ£mily. Before I ascended up the Stairs, I had my Eyes purified by a Water which made me see exâˆ£tremely clear, and I think they said it sprung in a Pit, from whence (as <HI>Democritus</HI> had reported)
<PB N="203" REF="207"/>they formerly brought up <HI>Truth,</HI> who had hid her self in it. I was then admitted to the upper Chamber of Prospect, which was called <HI>the Knowledge of Mankind;</HI> here the Window was no sooner opened but I perceived the Clouds to roll off and part before me, and a Scene of all the Variety of the World presented it self.</P>
<P>But how different was Mankind in this View, from what it used to appear! Methought the very Shape of most of them was lost; some had the Heads of Dogs, others of Apes or Parrots, and in short, where-ever any one took upon him the inferior and unworthy Qualities of other Creatures, the Change of his Soul became visible in his Counâˆ£tenance. The strutting Pride of him who is enâˆ£dued with Brutality instead of Courage, made his Face shoot out in the Form of a <HI>Horse</HI>'s; his Eyes became prominent, his Nostrils widened, and his Wig untying flowed down on one side of his Neck in a waving Mane. The Talkativeness of those who love the ill Nature of Conversation made them turn into <HI>Assemblies</HI> of <HI>Geese,</HI> their Lips hardened into Bills by eternal using, they gabbled for Diversion, they hiss'd in Scandal, and their Ruffles falling back on their Arms, a Sucâˆ£cession of little Feathers appeared, which formed Wings for them to flutter with from one Visit to another. The Envious and Malicious lay on the Ground with the Heads of different sorts of Serâˆ£pents, and not endeavouring to erect themselves,
<PB N="204" REF="208"/>but meditating Mischief to others, they suck'd the Poison of the Earth, sharpened their Tongues to Stings upon the Stones, and rolled their Trains unperceivably beneath their Habits. The Hyâˆ£pocritical Oppressors wore the Faces of Crocoâˆ£diles, their Mouths were Instruments of Cruelty, their Eyes of Deceit; they committed Wickedâˆ£ness, and bemoaned that there should be so much of it in the World; they devoured the Unâˆ£wary, and wept over the Remains of them. The Covetous had so hook'd and worn their Fingers by counting Interest upon Interest, that they conâˆ£verted to the Claws of Harpies, and these they still were stretching out for more, yet seem'd unâˆ£satisfied with their Acquisitions. The Sharpers had the Looks of Camelions; they every Minute changed their Appearance, and fed on Swarms of Flies which fell as so many Cullies amongst them. The Bully seem'd a Dunghil Cock, he crested well, and bore his Comb aloft; he was beaten by almost every one, yet still sung for Triâˆ£umph; and only the mean Coward prick'd up the Ears of a Hare to fly before him. Criticks were turned into Cats, whose Pleasure and Grumâˆ£bling go together. Fops were Apes in embroiâˆ£der'd Jackets. Flatterers were curl'd Spaniels, fawning and crouching. The Crafty had the Face of a Fox, the Slothful of an Ass, the Cruâˆ£el of a Wolf, the Ill-bred of a Bear, the Leachâˆ£ers were Goats, and the Gluttons Swine. Drunâˆ£kenness was the only Vice that did not change the
<PB N="205" REF="209"/>Face of its Professors into that of another Creaâˆ£ture; but this I took to be far from a Privilege, for these two Reasons; because it sufficiently deforms them of it self, and because none of the lower Ranks of Beings is guilty of so foolish an Intemâˆ£perance.</P>
<P>As I was taking a View of these Representatiâˆ£ons of Things, without any more Order than is usual in a Dream, or in the Confusion of the World it self, I perceived a Concern within me for what I saw; my Eyes began to moisten, and as if the Virtue of that Water with which they were purified was lost for a time, by their being touched with that which arose from a Passion, the Clouds immediately began to gather again, and close from either hand upon the Prospect. I then turned towards my Guide, who addressed himself to me after this manner. You have seen the Condition of Mankind when it descends from its Dignity; now therefore guard your self from that Degeneracy by a modest Greatness of Spirit on one side, and a conscious Shame on the other. Endeavour also with a Generosity of Goodness to make your Friends aware of it; let them know what Defects you perceive are growing upon them; handle the Matter as you see Reason, either with the Airs of severe or humorous Affection; someâˆ£times plainly describing the Degeneracy in its full proper Colours, or at other times letting them know that if they proceed as they have begun,
<PB N="206" REF="210"/>you give them to such a Day or so many Months to turn Bears, Wolves, or Foxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Neither neglect your more remote Acquaintance, where you see any worthy and susceptible of Admonitiâˆ£on; expose the Beasts whose Qualities you see them putting on, where you have no mind to enâˆ£gage with their Persons. The Possibility of their applying this is very obvious: The <HI>Egyptians</HI> saw it so clearly, that they made the Pictures of Aniâˆ£mals explain their Minds to one another instead of Writing; and indeed it is hardly to be missed, since <HI>Aesop</HI> took them out of their Mute Conâˆ£dition, and taught them to speak for themselves with relation to the Actions of Mankind.</P>

<P>THERE is a Sett of Mankind, who are wholly employed in the Ill-natured Office of gathering up a Collection of Stories that lessen the Reputation of others, and spreading them Aâˆ£broad with a certain Air of Satisfaction. Perhaps, indeed, an innocent and unmeaning Curiosity, a Desire of being informed concerning those we live with, or a Willingness to profit by Reflectiâˆ£on upon the Actions of others, may sometimes afford an Excuse, or sometimes a Defence, for Inâˆ£quisitiveness; but certainly it is beyond all Exâˆ£cuse,
<PB N="208" REF="212"/>a Transgression against Humanity, to carry the Matter further, to tear off the Dressings, as I may say, from the Wounds of a Friend, and expose them to the Air in cruel Fits of Diversion; and yet we have something more to bemoan, an Outrage of an higher Nature, which mankind is guilty of when they are not content to spread the Stories of Folly, Frailty and Vice, but even enâˆ£large them, or invent new ones, and blacken Characters that we may appear ridiculous or hateâˆ£ful to one another. From such Practices as these it happens, that some feel a Sorrow, and others are agitated with a Spirit of Revenge; that Scanâˆ£dals or Lies are told, because another has told such before; that Resentments and Quarrels arise, and Injuries are given, received, and multiplied, in a Scene of Vengeance.</P>
<P>All this I have often observed with abundance of Concern; and having a perfect Desire to further the Happiness of Mankind; I lately set my self to consider the Causes from whence such Evils arise, and the Remedies which may be applied. Whereâˆ£upon I shut my Eyes to prevent Distraction from outward Objects, and a while after shot away, upâˆ£on an Impulse of Thought, into the <HI>World of Ideas,</HI> where abstracted Qualities became visible in such Appearances as were agreeable to each of their Natures.</P>
<P>That part of the Country, where I happened
<PB N="209" REF="213"/>to light, was the most noisy that I had ever known. The Winds whistled, the Leaves rustled, the Brooks rumbled, the Birds chatter'd, the Tongues of Men were heard, and the Echo mingled something of every Sound in its Repetition, so that there was a strange Confusion and Uproar of Sounds about me. At length, as the Noise still encreased, I could discern a Man habited like a Herald (and as I afterwards understood) called <HI>Novelty,</HI> that came forward proclaiming a Solemn Day to be kept at the House of <HI>Common Fame.</HI> Immediately behind him advanced three Nymphs, who had monstrous Appearances. The first of these was <HI>Curiosity,</HI> habited like a Virgin, and having an hundred Ears upon her Head to serve in her Enquiries. The Second of these was <HI>Talkativeness,</HI> a little better grown, she seemed to be like a young Wife, and had an hundred Tongues to spread her Stories. The Third was <HI>Censoriousness,</HI> habited like a Widow, and surrounded with an hundred Squinting Eyes of a malignant Influence, which so obliquely darted on all around, that it was impossible to say which of them had brought in the Informations she boasted of. These, as I was informed, had been very instrumental in preserving and rearing <HI>Common Fame,</HI> when upon her Birth-day she was shuffled into a Crowd, to escape the search which <HI>Truth</HI> might have made after her and her Parents. <HI>Curiosity</HI> found her there, <HI>Talkativeness</HI> convey'd her away, and <HI>Censoriousness</HI> so nursed her up,
<PB N="210" REF="214"/>that in a short time she grew to a prodigious Size, and obtained an Empire over the Universe; whereâˆ£fore the <HI>Power,</HI> in Gratitude for these Services, has since advanced them to her highest Employâˆ£ments. The next who came forward in this Proâˆ£cession was a light Damsel, called <HI>Credulity,</HI> who carried behind them the Lamp, the Silver Vessel with a Spout, and other Instruments proper for this Solemn Occasion. She had formerly seen these three together, and conjecturing from the number of their Ears, Tongues and Eyes, that they might be the proper <HI>Genii</HI> of <HI>Attention, Faâˆ£miliar Converse,</HI> and <HI>Ocular Demonstration,</HI> she from that time gave her self up to attend them. The last who followed were some who had closeâˆ£ly muffled themselves in upper Garments, so that I could not discern who they were; but just as the foremost of them was come up, I am glad, says she, calling me by my Name, to meet you at this time, stay close by me, and take a strict Obâˆ£servation of all that passes. Her Voice was sweet and commanding, I thought I had somewhere heard it; and from her, as I went along, I learnâˆ£ed the Meaning of every thing which offered.</P>
<P>We now marched forward thro' the <HI>Rookery</HI> of <HI>Rumours,</HI> which flew thick and with a terrible din all around us. At length we arrived at the House of <HI>Common Fame,</HI> where a Hecatomb of <HI>Repuâˆ£tations</HI> was that Day to fall for her Pleasure. The House stood upon an Eminence, having a thouâˆ£sand
<PB N="211" REF="215"/>Passages to it, and a thousand whispering Holes for the Conveyance of Sound. The Hall we entered was formed with the Art of a Musick-Chamber for the Improvement of Noises. <HI>Rest</HI> and <HI>Silence</HI> are banished the Place. <HI>Stories</HI> of different Natures wander in light Flocks all about, sometimes Truths and Lies, or sometimes Lies themselves clashing against one another. In the midâˆ£dle stood a Table painted after the manner of the remotest <HI>Asiatick</HI> Countries, upon which the Lamp, the Silver Vessel, and Cups of a white Earth, were planted in order. Then dried Herbs were brought, collected for the Solemnity in Moonshine, and Water being put to them, there was a greenish Liquor made, to which they added the Flower of Milk, and an Extraction from the Canes of <HI>America,</HI> for performing a Libation to the inferâˆ£nal <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Mischief.</HI> After this, <HI>Curiosity,</HI> retiring to a withdrawing-Room, brought forth the <HI>Victims,</HI> being to Appearance a Sett of small waxen Images, which she laid upon the Table one after another. Immediately <HI>Talkativeâˆ£ness</HI> gave each of them the Name of some one, whom for the Time they were to represent; and <HI>Censoriousness</HI> stuck them all about with black Pins, still pronouncing at every one she stuck, something to the Prejudice of the Persons repreâˆ£sented. No sooner were these Rites performed, and Incantations uttered, but the Sound of a Speakâˆ£ing Trumpet was heard in the Air, by which they knew the <HI>Deity</HI> of the Place was propitiated and
<PB N="212" REF="216"/>assisting. Upon this the Sky grew darker, a Storm arose, and Murmurs, Sighs, Groans, Cries, and the Words of Grief or Resentment were heard within it. Thus the three <HI>Sorceresses</HI> disâˆ£covered, that they, whose Names they had given to the Images, were already affected with what was done to them in Effigie. The Knowledge of this was received with loudest the Laughter, and in many Congratulatory Words they applauded one another's Wit and Power.</P>
<P>As Matters were at this high Point of Disâˆ£order, the muffled Lady, whom I attended on, being no longer able to endure such barbaâˆ£rous Proceedings, threw off her upper Garâˆ£ment of <HI>Reserve,</HI> and appeared to be <HI>Truth.</HI> As soon as she had confessed her self present, the Speaking-Trumpet ceas'd to Sound, the Sky clearâˆ£ed up, the Storm abated, the Noises which were heard in it ended, the Laughter of the Company was over, and a serene Light, till then unknown to the Place, was diffused around it. At this the deâˆ£tected <HI>Sorceresses</HI> endeavoured to escape in a Cloud which I saw began to thicken about them, but it was soon dispersed, their Charms being controled and prevailed over by the superior <HI>Divinity.</HI> For my Part I was exceedingly glad to see it so, and beâˆ£gan to consider what Punishments she would inâˆ£flict upon them. I fancied it would be proper to cut off <HI>Curiosity</HI>'s Ears, and fix them to the Eaves of Houses, to nail the Tongue of <HI>Talkativeness</HI> to
<PB N="213" REF="217"/><HI>Indian</HI> Tables, and to put out the Eyes of <HI>Censoâˆ£riousness</HI> with a Flash of her Light. In respect of <HI>Credulity</HI> I had indeed some little Pity, and had I been Judge she might, perhaps, have escaped with a hearty Reproof.</P>
<P>But I soon found that the discerning <HI>Judge</HI> had other Designs, she knew them for such as will not be destroyed intirely while Mankind is in Beâˆ£ing, and yet ought to have a Brand and Punishâˆ£ment affixed to them that they may be avoided. Wherefore she took a Seat for Judgment, and had the <HI>Criminals</HI> brought forward by <HI>Shame</HI> ever blushing, and <HI>Trouble</HI> with a Whip of many Lashes, two Phantoms who had dogged the Proâˆ£cession in Disguise, and waited 'till they had an Authority from <HI>Truth</HI> to lay Hands upon them. Immediately then she ordered <HI>Curiosity</HI> and <HI>Talkâˆ£ativeness</HI> to be fettered together, that the one should never suffer the other to rest, nor the other ever let her remain undiscovered. Light <HI>Creduâˆ£lity</HI> she linkt to <HI>Shame</HI> at the Tormenter's own Request, who was pleased to be thus secure that her Prisoner could not escape; and this was done partly for her Punishment, and partly for her Aâˆ£mendment. <HI>Censoriousness</HI> was also in like manâˆ£ner begged by <HI>Trouble,</HI> and had her assign'd for an eternal Companion. After they were thus chain'd with one another, by the Judge's Order, she drove them from the Presence to wander for ever thro' the World, with <HI>Novelty</HI> stalking before them.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="218"/>The Cause being now over, she retreated from sight within the Splendor of her own Glory, which leaving the House it had brightned, the Sounds that were proper to the Place began to be as loud and confused as when we entered, and there being no longer a clear distinguished Appearance of any Objects represented to me, I returned from the Excursion I had made in Fancy.</P>

<HEAD>VISION V.</HEAD>
<P>WHatever Industry and Eagerness the moâˆ£dern Discoverers have shewn for the Knowledge of new Countries, there yet remains an ample Field in the Creation to which they are utter Strangers, and which all the Methods of Travelling hitherto invented, will never bring them acquainted with. Of this I can give a very particular Instance in an Accident which lately happened to me.</P>
<P>As I was on the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of this Instant, being <HI>Febr.</HI> 1715, walking with my Eyes cast upâˆ£ward, I fell into a Reflection on the vast Tracts of Air which appear'd before me as uninhaâˆ£bited.
<PB N="216" REF="220"/>And wherefore, said I to my self, shou'd all this Space be created? Can it only be for an odd Bird to fly through, as now and then a Man may pass a Desart? Or are there also Kingdoms with their particular Polities, and People of a Species which we know nothing of, ordain'd to live in it.</P>
<P>It was in this Manner I continued my Thought, when my Feet forsook the Level, and I was insensibly mounted in the Air, till I arriv'd at a footing as firm and level as what I had left. But with what Surprise did I find my self aâˆ£mong Creatures distinct from us in Shape and Customs?</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are of a small Stature, beâˆ£low those which History describes for Pigmies. The tallest of them exceed not fourteen or fifâˆ£teen Inches, and the least are hardly three. This difference proceeds only from their Growth before they are brought to Light; for after we never observe them to grow, unless it please their Parents, who have this uncommon Meâˆ£thod of enabling them: They recall them to the Womb, where having been for some Time, they receive an Addition to their Bulk, then go back to their Houses, and continue at a Stand as they did before. The Experiment has been often try'd with Success, but some have suffered extremely by undergoing it.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="221"/>Their Skins are like the antient <HI>Britains,</HI> all drawn over with a Variety of Figures. The Colour made use of for this end, is generally Black. I have indeed observ'd in some of the Religious, and Lawyers of the Country, Red here and there intermingl'd, tho' not so comâˆ£monly of late. They tell me too, they often us'd to paint with all Colours; and I visited two or three of the old Inhabitants, who were adorn'd in that Fashion: But this is now disâˆ£used, since the new Inventions, by which the use of a black Fountain that belongs to that Country, is render'd more useful and serviceâˆ£able.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cloaths</HI> in which they go clad, are the Skins of Beasts, worn by some Plain, by others with Figures wrought upon them. Gold is also made use of by some, to beautify their Apparel; but very seldom Silver, unless, as Buckles are by us, for fastening the Garment before. I have seen some of them go like Seamen in thin blue Shirts, others like <HI>Indians</HI> in a party-colour'd loose kind of Apparel, and others who they told me were the <HI>Politicians</HI> of the Country, go about stark naked.</P>
<P>The Manner of dressing them is this: At first when they come into the World, they have a Suit given them, which if it do not fit
<PB N="218" REF="222"/>exactly, is not, as with us, fitted up again, but the Children are in a cruel Manner cut and squeez'd to bring them to its Proportion. Yet this they seem not much to regard, provided their principal Parts are not affected. When the Dress is thus settled on them, they are clad for Life, it being seldom their Custom to alter it, or put it off: In short, they live in it Night and Day, and wear it to Rags rather than part with it, being sure of the same Torâˆ£ture, and a greater Danger if they shou'd be dress'd a second Time. I have further taken Notice, that they delight to go open Breasted, most of them shewing their Bosoms speckled. Some <HI>Lawyers</HI> indeed wear them quite White, perhaps for Distinction sake, or to be known at a Distance. But the finest Shew, is among the Beaux and Ladies, who mightily affect something of Gold, both before and behind them.</P>
<P><HI>Food</HI> I never saw them eat; they being a People, who, as I observed, live in Air: Their <HI>Houses</HI> are all single and high, having no back Rooms, but frequently seven or eight Stories, which are all separate Houses above one anoâˆ£ther. They have one Gate to their City, and generally no Doors to their Houses; tho' I have sometimes seen them have particular Doors, and even made of Glass, where the Inâˆ£habitants have been observ'd to stand many
<PB N="219" REF="223"/>Days, that their fine Apparel may be seen thro' them. If at any time they lye down, which they do when they come from their Habitatiâˆ£ons (as if coming Abroad were their greatest Faâˆ£tigue) they will lie together in Heaps without receiving Hurt: Though the soundest Sleep they get, is when they can have Dust enough to cover them over.</P>
<P>The Females amongst them are but few, nothing being there produced by a Marriage of Sexes. The Males are of a different Strength or Endowment of Parts, some having Knowâˆ£ledge in an extream Degree, and others none at all; yet at the same Time, they are mighty Pretenders to instruct others. Their <HI>Names,</HI> (for as many as wou'd discover them to me) I observ'd to be the very same as ours are upon Earth; I met a few who made theirs a Myâˆ£stery, but why, I am yet to learn. They are so communicative, that they will tell all the Knowledge they boast, if a Stranger apply himâˆ£self to their Conversation: And this may be worth his while, if he considers that all Lanâˆ£guages, Arts, and Sciences, are profest amongst them. I think I may say it without Vanity, that I knew a certain <HI>Talisman,</HI> with proper Figures and Characters inscrib'd, whereby their greatest People may be charm'd, brought to reside with a Man, and serve him like a Famiâˆ£liar in the Conduct of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="224"/>There is no such thing as <HI>fighting</HI> amongst them, but their Controversies are determin'd by <HI>Words,</HI> wherein they seldom own themselves conquer'd, yet proceed no further than two or three Replies: Perhaps indeed two others take up their Neighbour's Quarrel, but then they deâˆ£sist too after the same Manner; sometimes howâˆ£ever, Blows have ensu'd upon their Account, though not amongst them: In such a Case they have descended to inspire Mankind with their Sentiments, and chosen Champions from among us, in order to decide it.</P>
<P>The Time of their <HI>Life</HI> is very different, some dye as soon as born, and others in their Youth; some get a new Lease of Life by their entring into the Womb again, and if any weather it out to a hundred Years, they generally live on to an extreme Age. After which it is remarkable, that instead of growing weaker as we do, by Time, they increase in Strength, and become at last so confirm'd in Health, that it is the Opiniâˆ£on of their Country, they never can perish while the World remains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sicknesses</HI> which may take them off, besides what happens from their natural Weakness of Body, are of different Sorts. One is <HI>over-moisâˆ£ture,</HI> which affecting their Mansions, makes them lose their Complexions, become deform'd, and
<PB N="221" REF="225"/>rot away insensibly: This is often obviated by their not keeping too much within Doors. Anâˆ£other is the <HI>Worms,</HI> which prey upon their Bowâˆ£els: If they be maim'd by Accidents, they beâˆ£come, like us, so far useless; and that Maim will some time or other be the Occasion of their Ruin. However, they perish by these Means only in Appearance, and like Spirits, who vanish in one Place, to be seen in another. But as Men dye of Passions, so <HI>Disesteem</HI> is what the most nearâˆ£ly touches them; then they withdraw into, Holes and Corners, and consume away in Darkness. Or if they are kept alive a few Days by the force of <HI>Spices,</HI> it is but a short Reprieve from their perishing to Eternity; without any Honour, but that instead of a Burial, a small Pyre of <HI>Past</HI> shou'd be erected over them, while they, like the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> are reduc'd to Ashes.</P>
