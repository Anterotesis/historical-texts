<P>A REVIEW OF DOCTOR JOHNSON'S NEW EDITION OF SHAKESPEARE: IN WHICH THE IGNORANCE, OR INATTENTION, OF THAT EDITOR IS EXPOSED, AND THE POET DEFENDED FROM THE PERSE∣CUTION OF HIS COMMENTATORS.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY act, says goodman Delver, hath three branches: 'It is to <HI>act,</HI> to <HI>do,</HI> and to <HI>perform</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hamlet.</NOTE>.'—Contemptible as this piece of casuistry may be deemed; certain it is, that our honest grave-digger was not mistaken in the <HI>number</HI> of those distinctions, which are necessary to the investigation of moral merit. He was not so happy, indeed, in his specifi∣cation of the parts to be distinguished. His logic, however, may pass, if we conceive the <HI>first</HI> part of his division to comprehend the design or intent of the act; the <HI>second</HI> the manner of putting it in exe∣cution; and the <HI>third,</HI> the effects or consequences produced by it.</P>
<P>Thus, in apologizing for the present <HI>Review,</HI> there are three things to be considered. 1. The design or intent of writing it. 2. The manner in which it is
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
written; and <HI>lastly,</HI> the probable effects or conse∣quences that will ensue.</P>
<P>In respect to the former; the Reviewer begs leave to express his motives for writing in the words of an ingenious author, who stood exactly in the same pre∣dicament.
<Q>I thought it a piece of justice due to the memory of Shakespeare, to the reputation of let∣ters in general, and of our English language in particular, to take some public notice of a per∣formance, which, I am sorry to say, hath violated all these respects. Had this been done by a common hand, I had held my peace; and left the work to that oblivion, which it deserves: but when it came out under the sanction of a great name, that of a gentleman, who had by other writings, how justly I shall not [<HI>now</HI>] examine, obtained a great repu∣tation for learning; it became an affair of some consequence; as chimerical conjectures and gross mistakes might by these means be propagated for truth among the ignorant and unwary; and that be established for the genuine text, nay, the ge∣nuine text amended too, which is neither Shake∣speare's nor English <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to the Canons of Criticism.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Such being the motives of action, the intent and design of the act is plainly what is set forth in the title, viz. to defend the text of Shakespeare from the <HI>persecution</HI> of his commentators.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>The Reviewer is well aware that Dr. Johnson's self∣sufficiency may suggest a more sinister view. For, he doubts not, that gentleman <HI>thinks</HI> of himself, what he has <HI>said</HI> of Dr. Warburton, that he has
<Q>a name sufficient to confer celebrity on those who can exalt themselves into antagonists;</Q>
and hence he may possibly impute the present work to the motive which he insinuates to have actuated the opponents of that writer. The allusion, also, of the eagle and owl, which he quotes from Mac∣beth, may, with a very little latitude of construction, be applied as well to himself and the Reviewer, as to Dr. Warburton and his antagonist.</P>
<P>'An Eagle, tow'ring in his pride of place,</P>
<P>'Was, by a mousing owl, hawk'd at and kill'd <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Johnson's preface to his edition of Shakespeare.</NOTE>.' For tho', Dr. Johnson having neither preferment in the church, nor post in the state, the word <HI>place</HI> may seem to want that strict propriety the critics require; yet, if we reflect how nearly <HI>places</HI> and <HI>pensions</HI> are allied, there is not one of Shakespeare's commentators who would make any scruple of substi∣tuting one word for the other, reciprocally, and alter∣nately, as he thought the case might require. There is no doubt also that, on this occasion, the word pension would be preferred; as a pension must be universally allowed, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> to be better than a place, to a man so fond of doing but little; as it is apprehended the reader will think is the case with Dr. Johnson.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>To invalidate, however, the force of such a sug∣gestion, the Reviewer is reduced to the necessity of apparently boasting, that, in this respect, he does not lie under the disadvantage of being exactly in the same situation with the author of the Canons of Criticism; who frankly confesses, that it was the <HI>first,</HI> as it was the <HI>only</HI> book he wrote in his life. Dr. Johnson indeed may, in all probability, have never before heard the name of the present writer. He hath nevertheless some little literary reputation to lose; which he would not unadvisedly or wantonly put to the hazard.</P>
<P>This long-expected edition of Shakespeare is not the first work, by many, that he hath <HI>reviewed,</HI> nor is this Review the only book he hath written: For, tho' the name of Dr. Johnson is much better known than the merit of his writings, his Reviewer, on the contrary, hath hitherto chosen rather to have the merit of his writings known than his name. The publication of the one is of consequence to the world, that of the other of none but to the writer; with whose personal importance or insignificance the public have nothing to do <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In confirmation of what is here asserted, it may possibly be thought necessary to name some of those publications, on which the public have conferred the honour of a favourable reception.—It is presumed needless, however, to particularize performances that would certainly have been less faulty, had they been less nu∣merous. The author contents himself, therefore, with mentioning only his Epistles to Lorenzo; and the Translations of Rousseau's Eloisa, and Emilius.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>With regard to the <HI>second</HI> division of our prefa∣tory sermon, respecting the manner in which this Review is written; the author can readily fore∣see, that he shall be thought to have treated both Dr. Johnson and Dr. Warburton with an ill-becoming levity, if not with unmerited severity: at least, this he conceives will be the opinion of those, whom an innate consciousness of their own weakness in∣spires with a <HI>timidity,</HI> which they miscall, and flatter themselves to be, CANDOUR. The Reviewer con∣fesses indeed he should have been glad to have had, on this occasion, less to do with the commentary of the reverend gentleman last mentioned. And this, he hath reason to think, would have been the case, had not Dr. Johnson been prevailed on by his printer pru∣dentially to cancel several annotations, in which he had strongly expressed his dissent from that learned scholiast. But having, on second thoughts, judged it expedient to shelter himself, as it were, under the wing of the bishop of Gloucester; it is hoped the justice due to Shakespeare will excuse the Re∣viewer, tho' he should be sometimes obliged, in cor∣recting his present editor, to ruffle and expose an irreverend feather or two of the Bishop's.</P>
<P>That he may not be suspected, however, of at∣tempting to injure either, from a principle of spleen or resentment, he can safely aver, with regard to both, what another of Dr. Warburton's antagonists hath declared in respect to him alone; i. e.
<Q>That
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
he is personally a stranger to either of these gentle∣men; never conversed with them; never saw them [<HI>but once</HI>]; never had the least communication with them of any kind; never hath received or solicited any favour from either; nor, on the other hand, hath been ever personally disobliged by them; so that it is impossible this proceeding can have been influenced either by disappointment or resentment. The truth is, that the Reviewer hath always understood it to be an established law in the republic of letters, wisely calculated to restrain the excesses of insult, petulance and ill-nature, too apt to shoot up in the splenetic re∣cesses of solitary literature, that every writer should be treated on the same foot of civility, on which, when unprovoked by prior ill usage, he hath been accustomed to treat others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preface to the <HI>Revisal of Shakespeare's text.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
Now, whether he he hath treated either of these gentlemen worse than they have treated Shakespeare, he dares appeal to the impartiality of the public; which, at whatever low estimation it may rate an obscure author, who hath never set his name to a book; it will hardly think there can be a greater difference between <HI>him</HI> and this <HI>par nobile fratrum</HI> of commentators, than there is between them and the inimitable writer on whose works they have so freely commented. If the Reviewer hath at any time, indeed, behaved to∣wards these gentlemen with <HI>little</HI> ceremony, it hath been always when they deserved much <HI>less:</HI> for it is
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
to be observed, he had nothing to do with the poli∣tical characters of either. He did not think it ne∣cessary, therefore, to pay any deference to Dr. John∣son, as his majesty's pensioner; nor to Dr. Warbur∣ton, as bishop of Gloucester. Their literary cha∣racter was all that concerned him; and even, viewing them in this light, he had to respect them only as commentators on Shakespeare.—</P>
<P>Not that the Reviewer piques himself on being deficient in point of civility, or would take upon himself to infringe the necessary forms of decency and decorum. He admits, as Dr. Johnson observes,
<Q>that respect is due to high place, and tenderness for living reputation:</Q>
but then he conceives that re∣spect to be limited both as to place and time; and cannot admit that any tenderness for the Living gives us a right to trample inhumanly and sacrilegi∣ously on the Dead.</P>
<P>Had the Bishop of Gloucester, when he entered on that right-reverend function, made a public recan∣tation of the errors of poetry, and formally re∣nounced the pomps and vanities of verbal criticism; not one of the heresies he maintained, or the sins he committed in this kind, absurd and enormous as they were, should, with the Reviewer's consent, have risen up in judgment against him; or have been dragged from that oblivion, to which they seemed eternally consigned. But if either Dr. Warburton, or his friends, presume on the influence of lawn∣sleeves
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
in the republic of letters, it is proper to inform them there are neither Bishops, Priests nor Deacons in that community. The republic of let∣ters is a perfect democracy, where, all being equal, there is no respect of persons, but every one hath a right to speak the truth of another, to censure with∣out fear, and to commend without favour or affec∣tion. Nor is the <HI>literary</HI> community of less dignity than the <HI>political.</HI> Popularity and influence, indeed, may be obtained, for a while, by sinister means in both; but though birth and wealth may confer eminence and power in the one, not the descent of an Alexander, nor the riches of Croesus, confer prerogative or authority in the other.</P>
<P>In the primitive state of society, a superiority of intellectual abilities was the foundation of all civil pre-eminence; and hence the sceptre continued to be swayed by superior wisdom through a succession of ages. The acquisitions of science and learning were held among the ancients, in no less esteem than those of conquest, and in as much greater than the possessions of royalty, as a chaplet of laurel was preferred to a coronet of mere gems and gold. Xenophon reaped more honour from his Cyropaedia, than from the famous retreat of the ten thousand; and Caesar still more from his commentary, than from all the military exploits recorded in it. As to the examples of modern times; to say nothing of James and Christina, lest it be objected that one was a weak man, and the other a foolish woman, we have
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
seen the kings of Prussia and of Poland, the Alex∣ander and the Nestor of our age, ambitious to be∣come authors, and be made denizons of our little state. Frederick hath been more than once heard to say, he would give his crown, and Stanislaus, if he had not lost it, would have given another, to possess the sci∣entific fame of Leibnitz, or the literary reputation of Voltaire.</P>
<P>Is it, by the way, then, to be wondered at, that a private individual, like Samuel Johnson, should be even preposterously elated at finding that homage paid to him, which has been in vain solicited by sovereigns, and is refused even to the King on his throne? Graduated by universities, pensioned by his prince, and surrounded by pedagogues and poetasters, he finds a grateful odour in the incense of adulation; while admiring booksellers stand at a distance, and look up to him with awful reverence, bowing the knee to Baal, and holding in fearful remembrance the exemplary fate of Tom Osborne; presumptuous Tom Osborne! who, braving the ven∣geance of this paper-crowned idol, was, for his teme∣rity, transfixed to his mother-earth by a thundering folio! It may be a pity to disturb Dr. Johnson from so pleasing a reverie, and to dissipate so agreeable a scene of delusion; he will exclaim doubtless, with the honest citizen of Argos.
<Q><L>Pol me occidistis—</L>
<L>—cui sic extorta voluptas,</L>
<L>Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error.</L></Q>
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
But, if the interests of our literary state require it, it cannot be doubted that the mere gratification of an individual ought to be given up for the good of the whole community.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the <HI>third</HI> and last head of our discourse: the object of which is the effects or con∣sequences of the following Review. These, like the subject of our preface, may be divided also into three parts. In the <HI>first</HI> place, it is presumed the injuries done to the name of Shakespeare will be in a great measure repaired, and the lustre of his tar∣nished honour restored. In the <HI>second,</HI> it is feared Dr. Johnson will suffer not a little in his literary re∣putation; and in the <HI>last,</HI> it may be suspected, that the proprietors will be injured in the sale of the work.</P>
<P>In regard to the <HI>first</HI>; the pleasure, which it is presumed every true Englishman will feel, at the attempt to do justice to his favourite poet, will suffi∣ciently exculpate the author, had it been necessary to practise a still greater severity in effecting it.</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>second,</HI> it may not be impro∣per for the writer to offer something in his justifica∣tion. It is not easy to guess how far Dr. Johnson would have the <HI>respect due to living reputation</HI> extend, when applied to himself. He may possibly have adopted the opinion of Wolfius, and will plead the authority of that great civilian, to prove that men
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
of letters ought not to detract from the <HI>unmerited</HI> reputation of others. <HI>Nemo eruditorum alterius famae ac laudi, sive meritae, sive</HI> IMMERITAE <HI>detrahere debet.</HI> In reply to this, however, Mr. de Vattel, a civilian of equal authority, though perhaps of somewhat less note, takes a different side of the question; affirm∣ing, that no person hath a just complaint, because we may deprive him of a thing to which he hath no right, and which he unjustly assumes to himself. On the other hand, he determines that the literary reputation which is gotten undeservedly, is injurious to men of true merit; who thus become sufferers by the Vain and Undeserving. When praise, continues this able civilian, is prostituted on unworthy objects, it loses its value: the world grows distrustful, and in consequence of being made the dupe of preten∣ders, frequently refuses to bestow its applause on the truly Meritorious. Ought we to contribute to this injustice, for fear of depriving an impostor of the reputation on which he plumes himself, and to which he hath no well-founded pretensions? Surely not! Such is the reasoning of de Vattel on this interest∣ing point; how far it is applicable to any, or all the editors of Shakespeare, the public is to determine. It is sufficient that the Reviewer hath the civil law at least on his side, in his endeavours to do justice to merit; though he should be found to have de∣tracted, more in effect than with design, from the reputation of the Undeserving. His conscience is perfectly easy also, from the reflection that if he had not undertaken to expose the defects of Dr. John∣son's
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
work, somebody else would. For, as Mr. Ed∣wards justly observes,
<Q>the world will not long be imposed on by ungrounded pretences to learning, or any other qualification; nor does the knowledge of words alone, <HI>if it be really attained,</HI> make a man learned. Every true judge, as he observes, will sub∣scribe to Scaliger's opinion;</Q>
<Q>If, says that great Critic, a person's learning is to be judged of by his reading, no body can deny Eusebius the cha∣racter of a learned man; but if he is to be esteem∣ed learned, who has shewn judgment together with his reading, Eusebius is not such.</Q>
To this it may be truly added, in the words of another author, from whom this writer also borrowed them, as he used them on a similar occasion;
<Q>It is not the purpose of the following remarks, to cast a blemish on his [Dr. Johnson's] envied fame; but to do a piece of justice to the real merit of the <HI>comment</HI> and the <HI>commentator</HI>; by that best and gentlest method of correction, which nature has ordained in such a case; of <HI>laughing them down</HI> to their proper rank and character.</Q></P>
<P>As to the last point, viz. the interest of the pro∣prietors; the Reviewer thinks it very problematical whether this will be affected either way. He hath indeed known books sometimes sell the better for being publicly censured: but, be this as it may, he can truly aver that he meant them no harm; for, though it is possible that one or other of them may have sometimes failed a little in that respect to the writer, which he thinks an author has a right to ex∣pect
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
of his bookseller, and his bookseller, if he is wise, will be ready to pay him, yet he does not har∣bour so much resentment against any of them, as to wish to hurt their interest. If unluckily it should turn out, however, that the sale of Dr. Johnson's edition of Shakespeare should be hence obstructed, and that it should only <HI>hobble,</HI> instead of taking a <HI>run</HI>; the proprietors have nothing to do, but to en∣gage the Reviewer, if they can, or some body else, to furnish them with a better edition. Nor will this be a difficult task, although it would be an arduous and noble one, to give the public such a commen∣tary as the writings of this incomparable Bard de∣serve.</P>
<P>To detain the reader but a moment longer.—Dr. Johnson, having acted, in the outrage he hath committed on Shakespeare, just like other sinners, not only by doing those things he ought not to have done, but by leaving undone those things he ought to have done; his sins of omission are not less im∣portant, though much more numerous, than those of commission. Indeed, nothing is more usual with commentators in general, than to display their own sagacity on obvious passages, and to leave the dif∣ficult ones to be explained by the sagacity of their readers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Johnson, indeed, says, in his Preface:
<Q>Not a single passage in the whole work has appeared to me corrupt, which I have not attempted to restore; or obscure, which I have not en∣deavoured to illustrate.</Q>
How he hath succeeded in these at∣tempts, the reader is left to judge for himself on perusal of the following sheets.</P></NOTE>. The Reviewer, however, cannot be sup∣posed
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
here to have given a compleat commentary himself; indeed he hath been able only to include in the following sheets some few remarks on the most glaring blunders and defects that occur in this new edition; of which such wonderful things were promised and expected; and to which, having seen the prophecy fulfilled, we may apply, with as much justice as ever it was applied to any thing, that well∣known quotation from Horace.</P>

<L>I have with such provision in mine art</L>
<L>So safely order'd that there is no SOUL:</L>
<L>No, not so much perdition as an hair</L>
<L>Betid to any creature in the vessel, &amp;c.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This passage hath raised much contention among the com∣mentators; though it is authorized, it seems, by the old edi∣tions. Dr. Johnson, however, says
<Q>it is apparently defec∣tive. Mr. Rowe (continues he) and Dr. Warburton, read <HI>that there is no soul lost,</HI> without any notice of the variation. Mr. Theobald substitutes <HI>no foil</HI>; and Mr. Pope follows him. To come so near the right, and yet to miss it, is unlucky; the author probably wrote <HI>no soil,</HI> no stain, no spot: for so Ariel tells,
<Q><L>Not a hair perish'd;</L>
<L>On their sustaining garments not a blemish,</L>
<L>But fresher than before.</L></Q>
<PB N="2" REF="17"/>
And Gonzalo—<HI>The rarity of it is, that our garments being drenched in the sea, keep notwithstanding their freshness and glosses.</HI> Of this emendation I find that the author of Notes on the Tempest had a glimpse, but could not keep it.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Theobald is treated with no little severity in the pre∣face of the present editor, for pluming himself on his critical pe∣netration in making some discoveries that have escaped others. Dr. Johnson, however, gives himself an air of superiority in the above note, as exceptionable at least as any of Theobald's; as will appear on the slightest attention to the construction of the sentence; this pretended emendation, however plau∣sibly supported, being in fact entirely groundless.—What can we understand by NO SOIL BETID <HI>to any creature in the vessel?</HI> Or if we can with difficulty strain out a meaning, is the stile at all like that of Shakespeare; whose attention to colloquial idiom is so close, that our language is more indebted, in this respect, to him than to any other writer; I had almost said, all other writers put together?—If the passage is to be altered, let us at least make <HI>English</HI> of it: Shakespeare very probably wrote ILL; a word easily corrupted by the transcriber into <HI>soul.</HI>
<Q><L>—there is no ILL,</L>
<L>No, not so much <HI>perdition</HI> as an hair,</L>
<L><HI>Betid</HI> to any <HI>creature,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
To <HI>betide</HI> is to befal, to happen to, to come to pass, to be∣come of; and would here be very improperly used with <HI>soil</HI>; for even supposing there were no impropriety in saying a <HI>soil</HI> might <HI>betide a suit of cloaths:</HI> no idiom will bear a <HI>soil betiding to</HI> a <HI>creature,</HI> when its cloathing only was meant.</P>
<P>But what shall we say to the speeches of Ariel and Gon∣zalo, that seem to favour the <HI>emendation</HI> proposed?—What, indeed, but that they are little or nothing to the purpose! The poet was evidently judicious enough to apprehend the spectator must be offended with the palpable impropriety of bringing on a parcel of people, that had been just heartily
<PB N="3" REF="18"/>
soused in the sea, without any apparent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>For that it was only the external appearance of their gar∣ments that was preserved, is evident, from the speeches of An∣tonio and Sebastian immediately succeeding that of Gonzalo. <HI>Our garments,</HI> says the latter, <HI>are rather new dy'd than stained with salt water.</HI> On which Antonio says to Sebastian,
<Q>If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say, he lies?</Q>
To which re∣mark Sebastian answers, "Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report." Thus it does not appear that the <HI>creatures,</HI> the people themselves, sustained no <HI>soil, stain,</HI> or <HI>spot.</HI> On the contrary, it seems by their discourse that they were all in a very pretty pickle, notwithstanding their fair outside, which the decency of theatrical representation rendered necessary for the poet to bestow on them.</P></NOTE> soil or spot on their cloaths. To prevent him, therefore, from being thus offended on their appearance on the stage, Ariel is previously made to mention this circumstance to Prospero; and in order to reconcile the audience to it when the persons actually appear, Gonzalo is artfully made to remind them of what had been effected by the ministry of Ariel.—There is not the least ne∣cessity for telling this to the auditors three times over, or for Prospero to mention this circumstance at all to Miranda.—Prospero had before told her there was no <HI>harm</HI> done: which she thinks very strange; and he proceeds accordingly to ex∣plain from what cause there is no <HI>ill betid</HI> those, of whose dan∣ger she was so very apprehensive, and for whose safety she was so very solicitous. Hath not every friend to the reputation of Shakespeare, a right to exclaim here,—ILL BETIDE <HI>such com∣mentators!</HI></P>

<L>—and thy father</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>Perhaps, says our editor, it should be '<HI>and</HI> thou <HI>his only heir.</HI>' I say, perhaps not: for, if <HI>thou</HI> be admitted, without reject∣ing the preceding <HI>and,</HI> the measure is destroyed; and the sense is perfect without making any such innovation, if we
<PB N="4" REF="19"/>
dele the superfluous <HI>and,</HI> which may well be spared, in the third line, and read, with Theobald, A <HI>princess.</HI>
<Q><L>—and thy father</L>
<L>Was duke of Milan, and his <HI>heir</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>princess,</HI> no worse issued.</L></Q>
Perhaps the reader will be of my opinion, that the passage loses neither sense, spirit, nor propriety by this restoration. As Dr. Johnson tells us in his preface, that he has generally adopted Theobald's notes, unless confuted by subsequent an∣notators, it is to be wished he had always given his reasons for deviating from him in the text.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="page">
<HEAD>Vol. I. Page 17.</HEAD>
<P>The note contained in this page is so far a good one, as it is necessary and proper to give the reader an idea of the system of enchantment, on which the plot and machinery of the play is conducted. I should therefore have passed it over as unexceptionable, had it come from any other pen than that of Dr. Johnson. But as the world hath been pleased very publickly to impute sentiments to him, which seem in∣congruous with those he here professes, I cannot pass it over without some little animadversion. The incongruity I mean lies here: the Doctor, I have been frequently informed, very religiously believes in the existence of ghosts and appari∣tions; although he here strongly insinuates that there <HI>never</HI> was any such thing practised as witchcraft. But if he believes the story of the witch of Endor, and that the ghost of Sa∣mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> appeared to Saul, as doubtless he does, he must believe in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exerci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of witchcraft, and also in its power over de∣parted spirits. For, though some divines maintain that it was the devil who appeared in the form of Samuel, and not the ghost of Samuel himself; yet, as Dr. Johnson, in the note before us, adopts the distinction made by king James in his demonology, viz. that an <HI>enchanter is one who commands the devil, whereas the witch only serves him,</HI> he cannot be al∣lowed
<PB N="5" REF="20"/>
to shelter himself under the opinion of those learned theologues. Either Dr. Johnson therefore must give up his faith in apparitions, or retract this part of his note.—But af∣ter all, perhaps, I may have been misinformed by the wicked wits of the times; for though it be true they do avouch some corroborating circumstances, and advance some plausible pre∣texts, I think I can discover some fallacy at the bottom. Our editor's favourite, Hooker, it is true, talks of spirits dispersed up and down in caves and dens under the earth; and occa∣sion may hence be taken to give out, that the visit Dr. Johnson once made to a certain cemetery was to confer with some of these spirits. But in this these superficial witlings must certainly be mistaken; the spirits mentioned by Hooker were supposed, as is here observed, to be fallen angels. Hence, though I should be brought to believe, that our edi∣tor did go from Cock-lane to Clerkenwell, to fulfil an ap∣pointment with the ghost of Fanny, I cannot possibly sus∣pect him of ever going there purposely to meet the devil.</P>

<P>*In all the later editions this is changed to <HI>a fever of the mind,</HI> without reason or authority, nor is any notice given of an alteration.</P></Q>
<P>I wish our editor had given <HI>his reason</HI> for restoring the for∣mer reading, against the <HI>authority</HI> of <HI>all the later editions.</HI> He will say perhaps they are of no authority, as Theobald did of the editions of Rowe and Pope. But <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>authority</HI> seem in this case to be so much at variance, that I am appre∣hensive our editor will go near to be thought authority-mad, at least by many, for making this restoration without assigning the motive for it. <HI>Madness</HI> hath been, with propriety, called <HI>a fever of the mind,</HI> by writers of all ages and countries; and
<PB N="6" REF="21"/>
it is at best a pleonasm, or a piece of tautology, for Ariel to say, they played tricks of desperation, after he had said they were seized with madness. Perhaps our editor might think there was an impropriety, in saying that a <HI>soul</HI> felt a fever of the <HI>mind.</HI> But, not to stand upon the philosophical distinc∣tion that might justly be made between the mind and the soul, he cannot be ignorant that the word <HI>soul</HI> is here used in the vulgar and popular sense, as a <HI>man,</HI> a <HI>person.</HI> Will he persist in thinking it a sufficient reason for abiding by the old copies, that the transcribers and compositors could <HI>read?</HI> The same plea might be argued for perpetuating a number of blun∣ders committed in the present edition. Admitting also, after all, that the oldest copies are likely to be most authentic, and that such reading, if erroneous, could not thus pass through successive editions; yet I will undertake, in behalf of Shakespeare, to affirm, that he did not write the above sentence, as it now stands in the text. The commentators on Shakespeare are all very liberal in their declarations against the ungrammaticalness of his stile. Now I will not here con∣tend, whether he always wrote grammatically or not; but this I will maintain, that he always wrote idiomatically; if he did not always write <HI>grammar,</HI> he always wrote <HI>English.</HI> I wish I could say as much for the new-fangled accent-tuners of the present age; who, with their quaint and affected pre∣tensions to refinement and elegance, have so vilely corrupted the <HI>idiom</HI> of our tongue. Whosoever would recover, and ground themselves in this, must study Shakespeare, who, though he might possibly write
<Q><L>Not a soul</L>
<L>But felt <HI>the</HI> fever of the mad,</L></Q>
that is, such a fever as the mad, or as mad-men, feel, I will be bold to say, could never in this place write
<Q><L>Not a soul</L>

for if this means any thing, it must mean they caught a fever

<P><HI>The strangeness</HI>] Why should a wonderful story produce sleep? I believe experience will prove, that any violent agi∣tation of the mind easily subsides in slumber, especially when, as in Prospero's relation, the last images are pleasing.</P></Q>
<P>In answer to the odd question proposed at the beginning of this note, I have only to say, as the editor so frequently does, when he meets with difficulties, <HI>I know nothing of the matter.</HI> I have for such a <HI>why</HI> no <HI>wherefore.</HI> Nay, I know not that a wonderful story does produce sleep; unless it follows from a profound observation, which possibly our editor may have made, that old women and children generally amuse themselves with relating wonderful stories just as they are going to bed. The editor believes, experience will prove that any violent agita∣tion of the mind easily subsides in slumber. Now, if he does not mean simply by this, that when people are drowsy they cannot be violently agitated, I do believe, on the contrary, experi∣ence will prove, that no <HI>violent</HI> agitation of the mind <HI>easily</HI> subsides at all. I have indeed heard of somebody's being so desperately in love, as to fall into a profound lethargy; but I believe this too was only on the authority of some play-book, and much such another philosopher as Miranda. But, sup∣posing the fact to be true, what does the editor mean by ask∣ing so strange a question? or what does he intend by his re∣ply to it? Does he mean, for the credit of the poet, to account for Miranda's sleepiness from natural causes? Shakespeare is, doubtless, much obliged to him; but in this our editor seems rather too officious, as the poet hath taken care to inform us, that Prospero had caused it by the power of inchantment: a cir∣cumstance
<PB N="8" REF="23"/>
I wonder the editor should so soon forget, when he had complimented Dr. Warburton, but two or three <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 14.</NOTE> pages before, on his sagacity in discovering that Prospero's art-magic had, in this case, operated on her like a dose of liquid lauda∣num, and that he had wisely set it to work just as he was going to tell her the most interesting story she ever heard in her life.</P>

<L>Why speaks my father so urgently?</L>

<P><HI>Urgently</HI> for <HI>ungently.</HI> This is probably an error of the press; as, notwithstanding the instance above given of our editor's foisting in a <HI>thou,</HI> against all propriety of measure, I think neither the emendation of sense, if any is aimed at, nor even the authority of copies, can justify the breach of measure here. And indeed, though it should be the mistake of the printer, an editor, who is employed in <HI>literal</HI> and <HI>verbal</HI> criticism, is inexcusable for not cancelling the page wherein such errors occur. Yet these mistakes seem very frequently to happen in the present edition; thus, in page 6, Gonzalo is made to say
<Q><L>He'll be hang'd yet,</L>
<L>Though every drop of water swear against it,</L>
<L>And <HI>gap</HI> at wid'st to glut him.</L></Q>
All the other editions that I have seen, read <HI>gape</HI>; but perhaps our editor had some objection to a drop of water's <HI>gaping:</HI> but surely it might <HI>gape,</HI> and even <HI>swallow,</HI> as well as <HI>swear.</HI> Or, perhaps, he thought every single drop could never gape wide enough to take down a man-of-war's boatswain; and therefore chose to read it quaintly <HI>gap</HI>; meaning that the drops sepa∣rated from each other, and thereby made a gap for him in the sea. By <HI>every drop,</HI> however, Shakespeare meant all the drops, or the water collectively. After all, it is not unlikely, as our editor has no note on this word, that he did not think
<PB N="9" REF="24"/>
at all about it, but left the text to the mercy of the printer.—Poor Shakespeare!</P>
<P>Again in this very play, page 77. <HI>than</HI> is printed for <HI>that,</HI> and in many other places, both in the text and in the notes, these errors occur, to the great injury of the sense; so that one might be apt to think this edition (as Dr. Johnson affirms of the old ones) was AT LAST <HI>printed without correction of the press.</HI> It may be very true, as he also observes, that
<Q>before the editor's art was applied to modern languages, our an∣cestors were accustomed to so much negligence of <HI>English</HI> printers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I should refer my readers to the page of the preface, from whence this passage is cited; but, behold, such is the accuracy of <HI>modern British</HI> printers! the preface is not <HI>paged</HI> at all.</NOTE>, that they could very patiently endure it.</Q>
But is it not reasonably to be expected, Dr. Johnson, that, since the editor's art hath been so very <HI>successfully</HI> applied to mo∣dern languages, our printers should be a little more careful in correcting the press? or that the editor himself should a little attend to this matter?</P>

<P>This note serves to very little purpose in illustrating the au∣thor. It is a matter of no consequence to the spectator, whe∣ther the king and his lords thought the ship lost or not.
<PB N="10" REF="25"/>
They knew they must be somewhere in the Mediterranean. They were neither in the Atlantic ocean, nor the South-sea, and could not be cast ashore on Greenland, nor on Terra Au∣stralis incognita. And as they found the island pleasant and temperate, and affording 'every thing advantageous to life,' it was no wonder if they did not at all despair of subsisting there, till they should find means to get back to Naples, even if their own vessel and all the fleet were wrecked and gone to the bottom. But, though this annotation doth not serve to remove any difficulty, or display any merit in the author, it sufficiently serves to expose the incapacity of the annotator, for commenting on Shakespeare as a poet. He cannot see why Sebastian should plot against his brother, unless he actu∣ally knew how to find the kingdom he meant to inherit. But Sebastian's plot was <HI>natural,</HI> even supposing there had been more reason for diffidence in this particular. This editor might as well ask, why the chiefs of the rebellious party, in Henry the fourth, are made to quarrel about the division of the kingdom, before they are masters of it, and that of a king∣dom of which they never are masters? Yet this is one of the finest scenes in all Shakespeare, admirably representing that anticipation of our wishes and expectations, which is daily observable in men of sanguine constitutions, and is inseparable from the human mind. We are all too apt to <HI>count our chickens before they are hatched,</HI> and even sometimes to sell them too, and spend the money; which occasions the hen to fit so long brooding over the eggs, and produce so many addled ones at last.—'My annotations are no eggs.'—I did not say they were, Dr. Johnson; but <HI>qui capit ille facit.</HI></P>

</SP></Q>
<P><HI>For he's a spirit of persuasion,</HI> &amp;c.] Of this entangled sentence I can draw no sense from the present reading, and therefore imagine that the author gave it thus:
<Q><L>For HE, a spirit of persuasion, only</L>
<L>Professes to persuade;</L></Q>
of which the meaning may be either that, <HI>He alone, who is a spirit of persuasion, professes to persuade the king</HI>; or that, <HI>He only professes to persuade,</HI> that is, <HI>without being so persuaded himself, he makes a show of persuading the king.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Dr. Johnson seems here to have gotten <HI>a glimpse</HI> (as he before says of another commentator) of the author's meaning, but <HI>can∣not keep it.</HI> I wonder the word <HI>almost,</HI> in the preceding line, did not lead him quite into it. There is no necessity for altering the text any farther than to transpose the comma, placed after the word persuasion, to the end of the line. The meaning would then be this: <HI>He hath</HI> ALMOST [not quite] <HI>persuaded the king; for he is the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of persuasion only, he professes to persuade:</HI> that is,
<Q>He has only <HI>almost</HI> persuaded the king; for he hath no solid argument or weighty reason to enforce what he says; he hath only the mere volatile <HI>spirit</HI> of per∣suasion; that superficial vapour of words which exhales and carries with it only the appearance, the mere shew or pro∣fession of persuading.</Q>
—Or perhaps the word <HI>spirit</HI> is here used in a meaning nearly similar, for the mere form, appa∣rition, semblance; that is, not the body or substance of per∣suasion. But be it as it will, it seems that a better sense than either of Dr. Johnson's, may be <HI>drawn from this entangled sen∣tence,</HI> without the least alteration of Shakespeare's words. For it appears evident, from the opinion that both Antonio and Sebastian entertain of the capacity of Gonzalo, that the one would never call him the spirit of persuasion, as having the

But per∣haps, after treating this gentleman so scurvily as he has done in his preface, he might be ashamed to have it known that his sentiments so frequently coincided with so indifferent a critic.

</SP></Q>
<P>The opinions of the commentators are strangely divided about this elegant little song. Mr. Theobald reads, in the first line, <HI>there lurk I</HI>; observing that Ariel was a spirit of a refined aethereal essence, and could not be intended to want food. Besides, the sequent lines rather countenance <HI>lurk.</HI> For my part, I am apt to be of Mr. Theobald's opinion, for another reason; and that is, I think Ariel, though he should even be supposed to have occasion for more substantial food than the cameleon; yet he cannot mean to compare himself to a bee, or a suckling of any kind. Mr. Theobald's read∣ing is also more elegant; and yet our editor hath restored the old word <HI>suck,</HI> without giving any reason for it.—A more material alteration hath been attempted on the last line; which Mr. Theobald, in his Shakespeare Restored, conceived should be written, <HI>After sun-set merrily.</HI> This conjecture was countenanced by Mr. Pope, and adopted by Sir Thomas Hanmer: but Dr. Warburton rejected it with infinite disdain. Dr. Johnson also, having restored <HI>summer</HI> to the text, and quoted Warburton's note without any animadversion of his own, must be supposed to acquiesce in the force of what that learned commentator hath advanced; or at least, by his own confession, to have nothing better to offer.—And yet no∣thing, in my opinion, can be more inconclusive than the ar∣gument contained in Dr. Warburton's annotation.—It will be thought, no doubt, a little presumptuous in so petty an Aristarchus as myself, to attack conjointly two such gigantic and formidable critics. But I could not, with patience, see a Goliah treat the muse of Shakespeare like a common drab, at his pleasure; my weapon, therefore, is quickly out,
<PB N="14" REF="29"/>
you see, for
<Q>I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see oc∣casion, in a good quarrel, and the law of my side.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Warburton's note, as it is quoted by our editor, runs thus:</P>
<Q><HI>After summer, merrily.</HI>] This is the reading of all the editions: yet Mr. Theobald has substituted sun-set, because Ariel talks of riding on the bat in this expedition. An idle fancy. That circumstance is given only to design the time of night in which fairies travel. One would think the con∣sideration of the circumstances should have set him right. Ariel was a spirit of great delicacy, bound, by the charms of Prospero, to a constant attendance on his occasions. So that he was confined to the island winter and summer. But the roughness of winter is represented by Shakespeare as dis∣agreeable to fairies, and such like delicate spirits, who, on this account, constantly follow summer. Was not this then the most agreeable circumstance of Ariel's new reco∣vered liberty, that he could now avoid winter, and follow summer quite round the globe? But, to put the matter out of question, let us consider the meaning of this line,
<Q><L><HI>There</HI> I couch <HI>when</HI> owls do cry.</L></Q>
Where? in the <HI>cowslip's bell</HI> and <HI>where the bee sucks,</HI> he tells us: this must needs be in <HI>summer.</HI> When? <HI>when owls cry,</HI> and this is in <HI>winter.</HI>
<Q><L>When blood is nipt, and ways be foul,</L>
<L>Then nightly sings the staring owl.</L>
<BIBL>LOVE's LABOUR LOST.</BIBL></Q>
The consequence is, that Ariel flies after summer.</Q>
<P>Such is Dr. Warburton's elaborate annotation: in answer to which it may be observed that, whether Theobald's rea∣soning be right or not, his own arguments are egregiously wrong. I will admit, with Dr. Warburton, that Ariel here speaks of himself as a kind of fairy; but, supposing no objec∣tion to be made to the difference of climates, I do not know that Shakespeare hath any where represented winter so exces∣sively disagreeable to fairies, as to oblige them, like swallows,
<PB N="15" REF="30"/>
to expatriate on the arrival of winter. The argument he makes use of, and the quotation he brings to put the matter out of question, are insufficient, and are invalidated by many other passages in Shakespeare. He would infer from the two lines, quoted from the song in Love's Labour lost, that owls never cry but in <HI>winter.</HI> But the queen of the fairies, in the Mid-summer Night's Dream, says to her attendants,
<Q><L>—keep back</L>
<L>The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders</L>
<L>At our quaint Spirits.</L></Q>
And again, Puck, at the latter end of the same play, says,
<Q><L>Now the wasted brands do glow,</L>
<L>Whilst the scritch-owl, shrieking loud,</L>
<L>Puts the wretch that lies in woe,</L>
<L>In remembrance of a shroud.</L></Q>
Thus we see that the owls do cry, even in the presence of the fairies. It may not be amiss also to remark, that in the song of <HI>Winter,</HI> the owl is represented as <HI>singing a merry note</HI>; whereas, in the other passages, she is said to <HI>cry,</HI> to be <HI>clamo∣rous:</HI> which it might with great propriety be said to do in summer, when her hooting is contrasted
<Q><L>To the night-warbling bird, that now, awake,</L>
<L>Tunes sweetest his love-labour'd song—</L></Q>
A circumstance that does not operate to the owl's disadvan∣tage in the cold and dreary nights of winter, when the same hooting may even have something chearful in it; at least to those who are sitting by a good fire in the chimney-corner: <HI>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</HI> As to what Dr. Warburton says about following <HI>summer</HI> quite round the globe, I never be∣fore heard that <HI>summer</HI> itself went round the globe. That it vibrates from pole to pole is certain: but there is some little difference between that motion of the earth which causes sum∣mer and winter, and that which causes day and night.</P>
<P>In regard to Dr. Warburton's calling Theobald's reason, for altering the text, <HI>an idle fancy,</HI> and his telling us, that the
<PB N="16" REF="31"/>
circumstance of the bat is only introduced to design the time of night in which fairies <HI>travel</HI>; I must observe, that Ariel does not seem to be one of those kind of fairies, that, as Puck says,
<Q><L>—run</L>
<L>By the triple Hecat's team,</L>
<L>From the presence of the sun,</L>
<L>Following darkness like a dream.</L></Q>
On the contrary, he appears to execute the commands of Prospero by day-light. Nor is this inconsistent with his cha∣racter, as a fairy of a superior kind. For thus, Oberon, the fairy king, on Puck's telling him of the approach of morn∣ing, which hastens away those spirits that <HI>for aye consort with black-brow'd night,</HI> replies;
<Q><L>But we are spirits of another sort;</L>
<L>I with the morning light have oft made sport;</L>
<L>And, like a forester, the groves may tread,</L>
<L>Ev'n till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,</L>

<L>To fetch me trifles, and return again</L>
<L>As from a voyage rich with merchandize.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton, and our editor, have both attempted to illu∣strate this passage, without success. The difficulty lies in the sixth, seventh and eighth lines. Dr. Warburton says,
<Q>Fol∣lowing what? she did not follow the ship, whose motion she imitated; for that sailed on the water, she on the land. If by <HI>following</HI> we are to understand <HI>imitating,</HI> it will be a mere pleonasm—<HI>imitating would imitate.</HI> From the poet's description of the actions it plainly appears we should read
<Q><L>FOLLYING—</L>
<L>Would imitate.</L></Q>
<PB N="18" REF="33"/>
i. e. wantoning in sport and gaiety. Thus the old English writers—and they beleeven FOLYLY and <HI>falsely</HI>—says Sir J. Mandeville, from and in the sense of <HI>folâtrer,</HI> to play the wanton. This exactly agrees to the action described.—<HI>full often has she gossipt by my side</HI>—and—<HI>when we have laughed to see.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This note, Dr. Johnson tells us, is very ingenious; but, continues he,
<Q>since <HI>follying</HI> is a word of which I know not any example; and the fairy's favourite might, without much licentiousness of language, be said to <HI>follow</HI> a ship that sailed in the direction of the coast, I think there is no sufficient reason for adopting it. The coinage of new words is a vio∣lent remedy, not to be used but in the last necessity.</Q></P>
<P>I will not dispute with our editor the ingenuity of Dr. War∣burton's note, or that of his own; but it is certainly an in∣genuity of a different kind to that which is necessary to illu∣strate Shakespeare. The former of these gentlemen, I re∣member, affected to ridicule the booksellers for believing a silly maxim, that none but a <HI>poet should presume to meddle with a poet.</HI> The event, however, hath proved this maxim to have some truth in it. If either Dr. Warburton, or Dr. John∣son, had, in criticising this passage, exercised their ingenuity as poets, instead of their ingenuity as philologers, I am per∣suaded they would have soon discovered its meaning. But they were too intent upon <HI>words,</HI> to attend to the <HI>images</HI> de∣signed to be conveyed by them. The former talks of an ac∣tion described in two lines, wherein nothing is spoken of but <HI>gossipping</HI> and <HI>laughing.</HI> Do these imitate a ship under sail? To have been merely playful and wanton, is not the imitation here mentioned: nor does it consist in merely <HI>following</HI> the ob∣ject imitated, as Dr. Johnson conceives; for she did not only sail upon land, in the same direction along the coast as the ships did in the sea; but she <HI>returned</HI> again, which must have been in a different direction. So that it appears neither of these <HI>ingenious</HI> critics had any idea of the poetical beauty of this passage.—I shall endeavour to explain it, therefore, by a very

different mode of investigation.—If the reader hath ever seen a ship scudding before the wind, with its fore-sail grown <HI>big-bellied,</HI> as the poet expresses it, with the swelling breeze; he must recollect that, in such a case, the sail projects so far for∣ward, that it seems, to a spectator on shore, to go in a man∣ner <HI>before</HI> the rest of the vessel; which, for the same reason, appears to <HI>follow,</HI> though closely, <HI>after,</HI> with an easy, swim∣ming motion.—This was the moving image, which the fairy's favourite, taking the hint from, and the advantage of, her pregnancy, endeavoured to imitate; and this she did, by wantonly displaying before her the convexity of her swelling belly, and moving after it, as the poet describes,
<Q>—with pretty and with swimming gate.</Q>
Such being the sense of the passage, the text is easily ascer∣tained, by pointing and reading thus;
<Q><L>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gate</L>
<L>Following her womb, then rich with my young squire,</L>
<L>Would imitate.</L></Q>
This is the method a critic should take with the poets. Trace out their images, and you will soon find how they expressed themselves, without perplexing yourself either about the meaning of antiquated words, or the coinage of new ones.</P>

<P>That is, says our editor, we should read directly contrary to what the poet has written!

<L>No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to HEAR without warning.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>On this passage our editor quotes the following note from Dr. Warburton, without animadversion.
<Q>Shakespeare could never write this nonsense: we should read—<HI>to</HI> REAR <HI>without warning</HI>; i. e. It is no wonder that walls should be suddenly down, when they were as suddenly up;—REAR'D without warning.</Q></P>
<P>Had our editor nothing to offer better than this? And hath he so little veneration for Shakespeare, as so readily to coun∣tenance the charge against him of writing nonsense? Did you, Dr. Johnson, ever read the scene, wherein this passage occurs, quite through? I could almost venture to affirm, that neither you nor Dr. Warburton ever could have read it through with any attention. It seems to me morally impossible, if you had, that <HI>he</HI> could have made so egregious a mistake, or <HI>you</HI> have admitted it among your notes.—Shakespeare most undoubtedly wrote it HEAR, as it stands in the text. For not to insist upon the palpable defects of Dr. Warburton's ex∣planation, the most undoubted evidence in justification of this
<PB N="22" REF="37"/>
reading, may be deduced from the context. In the preceding page the wall makes a speech, on which Theseus says, <HI>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?</HI> and Demetrius answers, <HI>It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse.</HI> On this Pyramus enters and closes his speech with a curse against the wall. His speech ending with the words <HI>deceiving me.</HI> Upon which Theseus again thus remarks,
<Q>The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.</Q>
<HI>No,</HI> says the actor who play'd Pyramus, <HI>in truth, Sir, he should not.</HI> DECEIVING ME, <HI>is</HI> Thisbe<HI>'s cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Pyramus and Thisbe having met and spied each other through the crevice, for which purpose only the wall was in∣troduced, their interview is no sooner over than the actor who played the <HI>wall,</HI> apparently, without waiting for his cue, as no body speaks to him, and he speaks to no person in the drama, says,
<Q><L>Thus have I, <HI>wall,</HI> my part discharged so;</L>
<L>And, being done, thus <HI>wall</HI> away doth go.</L></Q>
On which Theseus observes again, as in the passage cited,
<Q>Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.</Q>
To which Demetrius answers; <HI>No remedy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is to be observed, that Demetrius doth not say, <HI>It is no won∣der,</HI> as Dr. Warburton expresses it in his explanation; but <HI>There is no remedy.</HI> I cannot doubt, therefore, that the above is the plain and obvious meaning of this passage. That the expression, how∣ever, may bear a reference to some latent meaning, I do not deny; and possibly it may refer to a custom practised by the magistrates in many places abroad, of sticking up a notice or warning on the walls of ruinated and untenanted houses, for the owners either to repair or pull them quite down.</P></NOTE>, <HI>my lord, when walls are so wilful, to</HI> HEAR <HI>without</HI> WARNING.

<L>We have with special soul</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton says,
<Q>This <HI>nonsense</HI> must be corrected thus; <HI>with special roll:</HI> i. e. by a special commission.</Q>
The pre∣sent editor, Dr. Johnson, thinks Warburton right in supposing a corruption, but less happy in his emendation. He reads, therefore, with <HI>special seal</HI>; which, he says, is a very natural metonymy for a <HI>special</HI> commission.—But why did not our editor obviate the objection made against this supposition of a corruption, by the author of the Canons of Criticism? Was his objection of too little weight, or was the writer of too little consequence to need a refutation? This author re∣marks on this passage, that
<Q>with special <HI>soul,</HI> may fairly be interpreted to mean, with great thought, upon mature deliberation; but that with special <HI>roll,</HI> for—by special <HI>com∣mission,</HI> is harsh and aukward; and to <HI>elect</HI> a man by a com∣mission, instead of—<HI>appoint</HI> him, is flat <HI>nonsense.</HI></Q>
Now, this objection lies equally against Dr. Johnson's reading as against Dr. Warburton's, and must be removed before I with∣draw my <HI>caveat</HI> against any innovation being made in the text. Indeed I will oppose, <HI>totis viribus,</HI> the admission of Dr. Johnson's <HI>seal,</HI> lest some future commentator should start up, and affirm that, although to <HI>elect by</HI> or <HI>with a commission</HI> may be nonsense; yet to ERECT <HI>by</HI> or <HI>with</HI> a commission is sense; <HI>to erect</HI> here meaning nothing more than to <HI>set up,</HI> to <HI>promote,</HI> which is done by <HI>commission.</HI> And how plausibly might not such an annotator maintain, that such reading would be per∣fectly consistent with the context?</P>

Tis only, he might plead, changing an <HI>l</HI> for an <HI>r,</HI> merely one liquid for another; the transcribers and printers might easily mistake it.—

<L>Else let my brother die,</L>
<L>If not a feodary, but only he,</L>
<L>Owe, and succeed by weakness.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This passage seems to have confounded all the commentators. Dr. Warburton makes the following curious and learned note upon it.
<Q>This is so obscure a passage, but so fine in its ap∣plication, that it deserves to be explained. A feodary was one that, in the times of vassalage, held lands of the chief lord, under the tenure of paying rent and service, which te∣nures were called <HI>feuda</HI> amongst the Goths. Now, says An∣gelo, <HI>we are all frail</HI>; yes, replies Isabella, <HI>if all mankind were not feodaries, who owe what they are to this tenure of imbe∣cility, and who succeed each other by the same tenure, as well as my brother, I would give him up.</HI> The comparing mankind, lying under the weight of original sin, to a feodary, who owes suit and service to his lord, is, I think, not ill-ima∣gined.</Q>
—This note, with little variation, is inserted in Theobald's edition; who says it explains one of the most beautiful allusions imaginable.—The present editor inserts this note also, without any remark of his own. He observes indeed, that to <HI>owe</HI> means in this place to <HI>own,</HI> to <HI>hold,</HI> to have possession.—For my part, I never could reconcile the words of this passage, by any mode of construction, to the sense here put on it. Indeed, it never appeared to me, from
<PB N="25" REF="40"/>
the tenour of the conversation, that Isabel could possibly en∣tertain such a constrained and far-fetched allusion, as the in∣genious Dr. Warburton hath here fished out for her. I con∣ceive her meaning to be much more simple, and if the reader observes the connection of this speech with those of Angelo that precede and follow, I doubt not but he will be of my opinion. It is true, that to <HI>owe</HI> means here, as in other parts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly in the Tempest; where Prospero says to Fer∣dinand,
<Q><L>—Thou dost here usurp</L>
<L>The name thou ow'st not.</L></Q></NOTE> of Shakespeare's writings, to <HI>own,</HI> to <HI>have,</HI> to be <HI>possessed of</HI> or <HI>invested with.</HI> The word <HI>feodary,</HI> however, is not derived from <HI>feuda,</HI> nor hath its meaning here any relation to the cus∣toms of the feudal times, but is derived from <HI>foedus,</HI> a cove∣nant, and is therefore mis-spelt, it having here the same mean∣ing as the word <HI>feodary</HI> in the following passage in Cymbeline, where it means an <HI>accomplice,</HI> a <HI>confederate,</HI> a <HI>companion equally guilty.</HI>
<Q><L>—damn'd paper!</L>
<L>Black as the ink that's on thee: senseless bauble,</L>
<L>Art thou a <HI>feodarïe</HI> for this act?</L></Q>
Taking the words in this, their true sense, let us see if we cannot, without forcing their construction, discover a mean∣ing more in character with the speaker, and therefore more likely to be intended by Shakespeare:

</SP></Q>
That is,
<Q>Let my brother die, if not one of his companions, if only he, of all his sex, is frail, and hath succeeded in his attempts on women, by taking advantage of a like frailty in them.</Q>
—That this is the true sense, I think, is put past dispute by the subsequent speech of Angelo; who takes occa∣sion, from the last suggestion of Isabel, to say
<Q>Nay, <HI>women</HI> are frail <HI>TOO.</HI></Q>
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>
Which is as much as if he had said,
<Q>Nay, the women, as you observe, are frail too.</Q>

<L>—</L>
<L>Women!—help heav'n! men their creation mar</L>
<L>In profiting by them, &amp;c.</L></Q>
That is, says Dr. Johnson,
<Q>in imitating them, in taking them for examples.</Q>
But I cannot see how we can, with any propriety, be said to <HI>profit</HI> by what mars our creation. I rather think Isabel means to say, that man disgraces himself by profiting or taking advantage of female weakness. And this seems to agree with the context.</P>

<L>—Reason thus with life;</L>
<L>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</L>
<L>That none but fools would keep:</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton, in order, I presume, to lay hold of an oc∣casion for altering the text, excepts against this passage, as being a direct persuasive to <HI>suicide.</HI> The absurdity, however, of supposing that the speaker intended it as such, is obvious, since he is endeavouring to instil into a condemned prisoner a resignation to his sentence. Dr. Johnson observes, that the meaning seems plainly this, that
<Q>none but fools would wish to keep li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; or, none but fools would keep it, if choice were allowed.</Q>
A sense which, whether true or not, he re∣marks, is certainly innocent. But though our editor is gra∣ciously pleased to exculpate Shakespeare in this particular, it appears to be only that he may fall upon him with the greater violence in a page or two after; where Dr. Warburton vouch∣safes to pay the poet a compliment. This passage is in the same speech as the foregoing;
<Q><L>—Thy best of rest is sleep,</L>
<L>And that thou oft provok'st; yet grosly fear'st</L>
<L>Thy death, which is no more.</L></Q>
This passage, says Dr. Warburton,
<Q>is evidently taken from
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>
the following, of Cicero: <HI>Habes somnum imaginem mortis, eamque quotidie induis, &amp; dubitas quin sensus in morte nullus sit, cum in ejus simulachro videas esse nullum sensum.</HI> But the Epicurean insinuation is with great judgment omitted in the imitation.</Q>
On this note Dr. Johnson hath made the fol∣lowing remark:
<Q>Here Dr. Warburton might have found a sentiment worthy of his animadversion. I cannot, without indignation, find Shakespeare saying, that <HI>death is only sleep,</HI> lengthening out his exhortation by a sentence which in the friar is impious, in the reasoner is foolish, and in the poet is trite and vulgar.</Q>
—Nor can I, Dr. Johnson, without equal indignation, find you misrepresenting Shakespeare, and thence taking occasion to condemn him for what he is not culpable; lengthening out your censure with imputations that, being false in themselves, appear as invidious in the <HI>man,</HI> as they are contemptible in the <HI>critic.</HI> Would not one imagine, from the warmth with which Dr. Johnson speaks of this pas∣sage, that it militates against the doctrine of the immortality of the soul; insinuating that in death we close our eyes, and sleep for ever?—Nothing, however, can be more foreign from the plain intent of the speaker, and the obvious meaning of the passage. The duke, in the assumed character of a friar, is endeavouring to persuade Claudio to acquiesce in the sentence of death passed on him, and to prepare himself for launching into eternity. To this end he advises him to think altogether on death; and to excite him to do so, he enume∣rates the several foibles of humanity, and the calamities in∣cident to human life; evidently intending by this means to wean his affections from the world, and render him less averse to part with it, and less apprehensive of the pain of dying. <HI>Thou oft provokest sleep,</HI> says he, yet absurdly fear to die; which, with regard to the painful and perplexing vigil of life, is only to go to sleep. For that he only speaks of the mere <HI>sense of death,</HI> the parting of the soul from the body, and that Claudio understood him so, is very evident, by the reply which the latter makes to his harangue; notwithstanding the very
<PB N="28" REF="43"/>
last words of it seem to be full as exceptionable as those ob∣jected to.
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—in this life</L>
<L>Lie hid a thousand deaths; yet death we fear,</L>
<L>That makes these odds all even.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I humbly thank you.</L>
<L>To sue to live, I find, I seek to die;</L>
<L>And, seeking death, find <HI>life:</HI> let it come on.</L>
</SP></Q>
If any thing further be necessary to corroborate what is here ad∣vanced, we might instance the duke's exhorting him, in scene III. of the same act, <HI>to go to his knees</HI> and prepare for death. It is highly inconsistent to think such a piece of advice should come from one who conceived death to be a perpetual sleep. Prayers must seem as superfluous to him, as the advice must appear impertinent to the prisoner. But that Claudio had the strongest notions of a future state after death is not to be doubted, since, speaking of the sin of debauching his sister, and An∣gelo's design to commit it, he says
<Q><L>If it were damnable, he being so wise,</L>
<L>Why would he for the <HI>momentary</HI> trick</L>
<L>Be <HI>perdurably</HI> fin'd?</L></Q>
Again, when his fears recurring, he tells his sister that
<Q>Death is a fearful thing,</Q>
it is plain, he doth not confine the meaning of the word, as the Duke did, to the mere act or circumstance of dying. For when she retorts upon him,
<Q>And shamed life a hateful,</Q>
he goes on,
<Q>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where.</Q>
As if he had said, I do not mean the mere pain of dying; it is what is to come after death that I fear, when we are to
<Q><L>—go we know not where;</L>
<L>To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;</L>
<L>This sensible warm motion to become</L>
<L>A kneeded clod; and the delighted spirit</L>
<L>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="44"/>In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice:</L>
<L>To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,</L>
<L>And blown with restless violence round about</L>
<L>The pendant world; or to be worse than worst</L>
<L>Of those, that lawless and incertain thoughts</L>
<L>Imagine howling; 'tis too horrible!</L></Q>
Can we think that Shakespeare could so far forget himself, as to be here so very explicit regarding the notion of a future state, if but two or three pages before he had been inculcating a contrary doctrine!—What then must we think of his commentator, who affects to be moved with indignation, and in effect presumes to charge him on this account with vulgarity, folly and impiety! Shakespeare appears to have had such a regard, even for his mortal part <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At least if he wrote the verses, said to be put on his grave-stone:
<Q><L>Good friend, for Jesus' sake, forbear</L>
<L>To dig the dust inclosed here.</L>
<L>Blest be the man that spares these stones,</L>
<L>And curst be he who moves my bones.</L></Q></P></NOTE>, as to bestow a curse on the person who should disturb his ashes; what a severe malediction, then, would he not have bestowed on that sacrilegious hand, which hath thus mangled his immortal re∣putation, could he have penetrated the womb of time, or an∣ticipated the temerity of a modern critic <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>I had written the above remarks and sent them to the press, without recollecting that a similar reference to this imprecation of Shakespeare is to be met with in the appendix to the Canons of Criticism, (last edition, page 260.)
<Q>I leave the public to judge, says that sensible critic, which has been engaged <HI>against</HI> Shake∣speare, Mr. Warburton or I, who have in part at least vindicated that best of poets from the worst of critics; from one, who has been guilty of a greater violation of him, than that of the authors on which he imprecated vengeance in his epitaph. A violation which, were he not armed against the superstition of believing in portents and prodigies, might make him dread the apparition of that injured bard.</Q>
—Here we see the murder comes out: Dr. Warburton, it is true, was not only armed against the superstition
<PB N="30" REF="45"/>of believing in ghosts, by his principles as a <HI>philosopher,</HI> but also against their doing him hurt, by the awful power annexed to his sacred functions and character as a <HI>priest.</HI> But this is not the case with Dr. Johnson, whose religion and philosophy put together, it seems, cannot secure him against the terrors of such superstition: so that, as I before observed, here the secret comes out; and we see the reason for his sitting up all night, and lying a-bed all day, for fear of apparitions—It is not so much from his fear of ghosts in ge∣neral, (for we know he did not appear to be afraid of Fanny) but of the ghost of Shakespeare, whose fame he is conscious of having inhumanly assassinated, and whose violated muse cries aloud for vengeance against him.</P>

<P>The stupid editors, says Dr. Warburton (whose note in this passage Dr. Johnson hath quoted) mistaking <HI>guards</HI> for satellites, whereas it here signifies <HI>lace,</HI> altered PRIESTLY, in both places, to PRINCELY.

But <HI>princely guards</HI> means nothing but <HI>rich lace,</HI> which is a sense the passage will not bear. <HI>Angelo,</HI> indeed, as <HI>deputy,</HI> might be called the <HI>princely An∣gelo</HI>; but not in this place, where the immediately pre∣ceding words of, This <HI>outward-sainted</HI> deputy, demand the reading I have restored.</P></Q>
To this very curious argument of Dr. Warburton's, the present editor only adds the follow∣ing note.</P>
<P><Q>The first folio has, in both places, <HI>prenzie,</HI> from which the other folios made <HI>princely,</HI> and every editor may make what he can.</Q></P>
<P>It is really very kind of Dr. Johnson to give <HI>others</HI> leave to make SOMETHING of what he can make NOTHING <HI>himself.</HI>—Let us see, therefore, what others <HI>have made</HI> of it.—The author of the Canons of Criticism objects to Dr. Warbur∣ton's emendation; observing that,
<Q>if <HI>princely guards</HI> means nothing but <HI>rich lace,</HI> he should be glad to know how <HI>priestly guards</HI> should come to signify any thing more than <HI>black lace?</HI></Q>
—The author of the Revisal of Shakespeare's Text, goes still farther, and says,
<Q>We should undoubtedly
<PB N="32" REF="47"/>
restore the ancient reading in both places, the <HI>princely</HI> An∣gelo, and in <HI>princely</HI> guards. Nothing [says he] can be weaker and more destitute of all foundation, than Mr. War∣burton's criticism. Angelo is represented as supporting the state of a prince, and the authority of government, by excessive severity; but there is not the least hint [given] in the whole play of his affecting a sanctified exterior, or setting up for a devotee.</Q>
<HI>Priestly guards,</HI> we are told,
<Q>means sanctity;</Q>
but how the body could be invested or covered
<Q>with sanctity, Mr. Warburton hath not thought proper to explain; for I presume he doth not imagine that he wore the priestly habit, to which he could be no way en∣titled, as appears by his marriage afterwards, as well as from many other circumstances needless to enumerate.</Q>
<Q>In princely guards,</Q>
most certainly signifies in a habit adorned "as becomes a prince."</P>
<P>If it be thought necessary to add any thing to these re∣marks; it may be observed, that the word <HI>guards</HI> is not strictly confined to mean <HI>lace,</HI> as Dr. Warburton insinuates; but is used for ornaments of dress, or finery in general. Thus Shakespeare, in some other of his plays, I think it is in Love's Labour Lost, speaks of the <HI>guards of Cupid's hose</HI>; in all pro∣bability meaning the clocks of his stockings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am well aware that our ancestors, wearing long hose, sometimes included their breeches too under that denomination; but I cannot suppose this part of the dress would be particularly specified, if <HI>lace</HI> merely was intended, unless Cupid might be supposed to have worn laced breeches without having a laced coat.</P></NOTE>; which could not with propriety be called <HI>lace.</HI> Dr. Warburton, indeed, thinks the word <HI>livery,</HI> in this sentence, fixes that of <HI>guards</HI> to mere <HI>lace,</HI> because, it is true, most liveries are laced. It does not, however, follow that <HI>lace</HI> is essential to a <HI>livery,</HI> or that a livery might not be given to servants without any lace in the trimming of it: for the word <HI>livery</HI> comes either from the French <HI>livrée,</HI> of <HI>livrer,</HI> to deliver or give; or from the Italian <HI>livrea,</HI> or the Spanish <HI>librea,</HI> all having the same
<PB N="33" REF="48"/>
meaning; so that a suit of cloaths, with trimmings of a dif∣ferent colour, given to a servant, is as much a <HI>livery,</HI> as if it were covered with <HI>lace.</HI> Again, to come nearer the point, can we suppose that when Bassanio, in the Merchant of Ve∣nice, commands his followers to give Launcelot
<Q><L>—a livery</L>
<L>More <HI>guarded</HI> than his fellows:</L></Q>
he means particularly that it should have more <HI>lace</HI> on it? No, surely, he only means that it should, on the whole, be more fine and gaudy.</P>
<P>The meaning of the words thus settled, it is with great propriety Isabel calls the princely badges and ducal finery of Angelo the <HI>cunning</HI> LIVERY <HI>of hell</HI>; as being <HI>given</HI> him in order that he might the more effectually serve its abhorred and damnable purposes.</P>

<SPEAKER>LUCIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is there none of Pigmalion's images, newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket, and extracting it clutched?</P>
</SP></Q>
<P><PB N="34" REF="49"/>Dr. Warburton says, the meaning of this passage is,
<Q>Are there no women come out cured from a salivation?</Q>
And this explanation is implicitly adopted by Dr. Johnson. The author of the Revisal, however, supposes the meaning of this very affected cant to be,
<Q>Are there no fresh women, no maidenheads to be had now? For (continues the Re∣viser, very gravely) Pigmalion's statue newly made woman, was certainly a pure virgin.</Q>
—Now, not to controvert the virginity of a marble statue, or to query how long it re∣mained so, when converted into flesh and blood, in the hands of
<Q><L>Pig (what do ye call him) malion</L>
<L>That long'd to use her like a stallion.</L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Virgil travestie.</NOTE></Q>
I conceive these scholiasts to be all mistaken with regard to the sense of the passage. It is perfectly agreeable to the cha∣racter of Lucio, to call an innocent <HI>uncome-at-able</HI> virgin a Pigmalion's statue; nor could he with any propriety give that name to a prostitute, either under a salivation, or newly come out of it. What he meant, therefore, by Pigmalion's images newly made women, was young girls newly de∣bauched. The deflowering a maid is frequently called, by dramatic writers, the <HI>making a woman</HI> of her. Again, I think it pretty evident that Lucio is too well acquainted with rogues and bawds, too deep in "the trick of it," not to know that maidenheads were commodities they seldom dealt in. On the other hand, I think it as plain that Lucio did not ask after such battered brims as might be just come out of the powdering tub: for when the clown tells him his mi∣stress is herself in that situation, he says, <HI>'Tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so. Ever your</HI> FRESH <HI>whore, and your powder'd bawd: an unshunn'd consequence: it must be so.</HI>—I fancy Lucio would be apt to think such pickled devils as came out of the powdering tub, <HI>sound</HI> as they possibly might be, too <HI>stale</HI> to be called <HI>fresh</HI> meat.</P>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="50"/>IBID.—What reply? Ha! what say'st thou to this tune, matter and method? is't not drown'd i'th' last reign? Ha! what say'st thou, trot?</Q>
<P><Q>This strange nonsense (says Dr. Warburton) should be thus corrected, IT's <HI>not</HI> DOWN <HI>i'th' last</HI> REIGN. <HI>i. e.</HI> these are severities unknown to the old duke's time. And this is to the purpose.</Q></P>
<P>Very much to the purpose truly! and so the ingenious au∣thor of the Canons of Criticism hath shewn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Canons of Criticism, page 25.</NOTE>; notwithstand∣ing which, our editor, without taking the least notice of what Mr. Edwards has advanced, proceeds thus.
<Q>Dr. Warbur∣ton's emendation is ingenious; but I know not whether the sense may not be restored with less change. Let us consider it. Lucio, a prating fop, meets his old friend going to pri∣son, and pours out upon him his impertinent interrogatories: to which, when the poor fellow makes no answer, he adds, <HI>What reply? Ha! what say'st thou to this? tune, matter and method—is't not! drown'd i'th' last rain? ha? what say'st thou, trot?</HI> &amp;c. It is a common phrase used in low raillery of a man crest-fallen and dejected, that <HI>he looks like a drown'd puppy.</HI> Lucio, therefore asks him whether he was drowned in the last rain, and therefore cannot speak?</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Johnson's explanation of this passage is, in my opinion, less clear and much less consistent with his own pointing than that given by Mr. Edwards. Indeed the latter supposes Pom∣pey's answer only to be drowned in the last rain [a prover∣bial phrase, he says, to express a thing which is lost, or ra∣ther not to be found]; whereas Dr. Johnson supposes that Pompey himself is taxed with having been drowned in the last rain. Taking their own authority, however, for the use of their proverbs, Mr. Edwards's explanation is not half so far-fetched as Dr. Johnson's. It is, indeed, a strange round-about kind of salutation, to ask a man whether or not
<PB N="36" REF="51"/>
he was drowned in the last rain; because, truly, he looks dejected, and therefore may be phraseologically compared to a drown'd puppy?</P>
<P>Dr. Gray would make a farther emendation of the text, in this passage, of which our editor hath made mention in his appendix; but seems to disapprove it. The Doctor proposes that, instead of reading <HI>what say'st thou, trot?</HI> we should read, <HI>what say'st thou to't?</HI> the word <HI>trot</HI> being seldom, if ever, used to a man.—To this Dr. Johnson replies,
<Q><HI>Trot,</HI> or as it is now often pronounced <HI>honest trout,</HI> is a familiar address to a man among the provincial vulgar.</Q>
Now, it appears to me, although I think Dr. Gray's emendation very admissible, that Lucio might very probably here mean to give Pompey an appellation usually given to women, by way of gibing him for following so scandalous an employment as that of a bawd, usually practised by wretches of that sex. But be this as it may, I think nobody can hesitate about Dr. Johnson's being in the wrong, when he supposes that Lucio might call Pom∣pey Bum, the cock-bawd, HONEST <HI>trout.—Trout!</HI> indeed! Dr. Johnson surely must imagine his readers to be very <HI>gud∣geons,</HI> to bait his hook with such grubs, as these grub-street annotations!</P>
<P>Vol. I. pages 329 and 330. are inserted two notes from Dr. Warburton, without any remark of the editor's; notwith∣standing they are both sufficiently refuted and exploded in the Canons of Criticism, pages 25 and 26. I must beg leave, however, for that reason to pass them over here.</P>

<P>Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind! this would make Mercy swear, and play the tyrant.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>I doubt not but my readers have already observed that, when Dr. Johnson's sentiments coincide with Dr. Warbur∣ton's,
<PB N="37" REF="52"/>
he does not chuse to hazard them for his own; as he does when they agree with those of Edwards, and some others. But, for fear they should be wrong, he takes advan∣tage of the <HI>verbum sacerdotis,</HI> and skulks behind the name of WARBURTON. This he does with regard to the passage now before us; and yet if I should admit a single emendation of all those Dr. Warburton proposes, I believe it would be this; and yet I don't approve of it. But the case is, I as little ap∣prove of what is advanced by others in favour of the present reading, and yet, as Dr. Johnson says, nothing better suggests itself. Dr. Warburton says,
<Q>We should read SWERVE, i. e. deviate from her nature. The common reading gives us the idea of a ranting whore.</Q>
In opposition to this, the author of the Revisal says, the common reading is
<Q>agreeable to a very common form of expression, <HI>This would make a saint swear,</HI> and supposes it means no more than that the excess of the provocation would get the better of the mild disposition even of Mercy herself, and put her in a passion.</Q>
In answer again to this, however, it may be observed, that we have no such <HI>very common</HI> form of speech as is here as∣serted. Nay, I don't know that we can possibly have occa∣sion for such a form. Make a <HI>saint</HI> swear! Pray where are there any saints now-a-days to be met with? For my part, I never conversed with any but fictitious ones. I have heard, indeed, of things being provoking enough <HI>to make a</HI> PARSON <HI>swear,</HI> and that even in the middle of his sermon. But alas! alas! there is a great difference between <HI>saints</HI> and <HI>parsons</HI>; though I hope the author of the Revisal is too honest a man wilfully to impose a parson on his readers for a saint.—The true state of the case appears to me to be as follows: the poet did not intend, or at least did not effect, a compleat personification of Mercy. If he had, he would not have given us the idea of a ranting whore, as Dr. Warburton justly expresses it; nor would he have represented Mercy as stripped of her attributes, or put in a passion, as the Reviser
<PB N="38" REF="53"/>
has it.—It seems to me that Escalus speaks of that mercy, or merciful disposition, existing in his own breast, agreeable, and in reply, to what the bawd had said to him in the pre∣ceding speech. <HI>Your honour is accounted a</HI> MERCIFUL <HI>man.</HI> To which he answers,
<Q>Yes, but such provocation would make me, merciful as I am, swear and play the tyrant.</Q>
To this it may be objected, that Escalus represents himself in this case as a ranting bully, just as Mercy, in the other, gives the idea of a ranting whore. So that, perhaps, after all, we had better abide by the literal construction of the text, and suppose the prosopopeia compleat; in which case to <HI>swear</HI> must mean to make a vow never to be moved by pleas or in∣tercession; to be <HI>unrelenting,</HI> being one of the principal cha∣racteristics of a tyrant.</P>

<P>A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully, but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless and fearless of what's past, present or to come; insensible of mortality, and desperately mortal.</P>

<P><HI>Desperately mortal.</HI>] This expression is obscure. Sir Thomas Hanmer reads <HI>mortally desperate.

<P>I wish Dr. Johnson, every time he had dictated any of the articles of his critical creed, had given us a reason for the faith that is in him. Why he should believe Barnardine to be desperately <HI>mischievous,</HI> I cannot possibly conceive. The Provost seems to give him a very different character: <HI>He hath evermore,</HI> says he, <HI>had the liberty of the prison: give him leave to escape hence, he would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very often awaked him, as if to carry him to execution, and shewed him a seeming warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.</HI> Is this the description of a man <HI>desperately mischievous?</HI> I should rather think that, by
<PB N="39" REF="54"/>
<HI>desperately mortal,</HI> means totally incurable of diseases, acquired by his beastly course of life; or else that, despairing or care∣less of life, he looks upon himself as dead to the world, and takes no thought of what becomes of him.

<L>—and what he with his oath</L>
<L>By all probation will make up full clear,</L>
<L>Whenever he's <HI>convented.</HI> First, for this woman.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Johnson hath here inserted the word <HI>convented,</HI> instead of <HI>convened,</HI> which was the common reading. <HI>Convented,</HI> indeed, was the reading of the first folio, which Dr. Warburton in∣sists upon to be right <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And yet Dr. Warburton, as the author of the Revisal shrewdly remarks, calls that edition, on another occasion,
<Q>the old blun∣dering folio.</Q></NOTE>, giving his reasons for it in the fol∣lowing arrogant and foolish note, which is as impertinently and fillily adopted by our editor.
<Q>The first folio reads <HI>con∣vented,</HI> and this is right; for to <HI>convene</HI> signifies to assem∣ble; but <HI>convent,</HI> to cite or summons. Yet, because <HI>con∣vented</HI> hurts the measure, the Oxford editor sticks to <HI>convened,</HI> though it be <HI>nonsense,</HI> and signifies, <HI>whenever he is assembled together.</HI> But thus it will be, when the author is thinking of one thing, and his critic of another. The poet was at∣tentive to his sense, and the editor, quite throughout his
<PB N="40" REF="55"/>
performance, to nothing but the measure; which Shakes∣peare having entirely neglected, like all the dramatic writers of that age, he has spruced him up with all the exactness of a modern measurer of syllables.</Q></P>
<P>I should be glad to know how either Dr. Warburton or Dr. Johnson came to know that Shakespeare <HI>entirely neglected measure?</HI> Shakespeare had a poetical ear; and though he might not stand to count his fingers, as probably these gentle∣men do when they write verses, he wrote in general much more melodiously than any of the dramatic writers of his own age, or perhaps of the present. The Oxford editor did very wisely, therefore, in abiding by the measure, as he could do it without any injury to the sense. For to <HI>convene,</HI> as the au∣thor of the Revisal justly observes, means not only to <HI>assemble together,</HI> but to <HI>cite</HI> or <HI>cause to appear</HI>; and is rendered in Latin by <HI>cito, cieo.</HI>—To this I may add also, that <HI>cito</HI> does not mean simply to <HI>cite</HI> or <HI>summons</HI> in general, but also to sum∣mons or produce as a witness, exactly agreeable to the case before us. Thus CICERO, <HI>in hâc re te testem citabo.</HI> But perhaps these learned gentlemen will object to all this, be∣cause the verb <HI>convene</HI> is not derived from <HI>cito, cico,</HI> but from <HI>convenio</HI>: they will profit little, however, by this evasion; for the verb <HI>convenio</HI> itself is used in the sense of giving a cita∣tion or summons. Thus PLAUTUS, <HI>illum in jus conveniam.</HI> But supposing these quotations to be, as learned quotations generally are, nothing at all to the purpose, I may safely bor∣row a phrase from Scripture on this occasion, and say to Dr. Johnson, <HI>Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou</HI> CARE∣LESS COMMENTATOR! The author of the Revisal seems a little unhappy that, having kept no common-place-book, he cannot produce an example of the use of the word <HI>convene</HI> in the sense contended for: but, if he had turned to Dr. John∣son's common-place-book, i. e. his folio dictionary, he would have there found that this sense is properly authorized. To <HI>convene,</HI> says the lexicographer, is <HI>to summon judicially</HI>; as a
<PB N="41" REF="56"/>
proof of which he quotes the following passage from AY∣LIFFE; <HI>By the papal canon law, clerks, in criminal and civil causes, cannot be</HI> CONVENED <HI>before any but an ecclesiastical judge.</HI>—What a pity it is there should be so little connection between Samuel Johnson, M. A. the lexicographer, and Dr. Johnson the commentator? But so it is; nor is it any thing new; people are apt to forget themselves as they rise to pre∣ferment.</P>

Again, Dr. Johnson is equally at a loss with respect to the passage before us. He hath not omitted, however, to display Dr. Warburton's eru∣dition and sagacity on the occasion.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop.</HI>] Barbers shops were, at all times, the resort of idle people.
<Q><L>Tonstrina erat quaedam: hic solebamus ferè</L>
<L>Plerumque eam opperiri—</L></Q>
Which <HI>Donatus</HI> calls <HI>apta sedes otiosis.</HI> Formerly, with us, the better sort of people went to the barber's shop to be trimm'd, <HI>who</HI> then practised the under-parts of surgery; so that he had occasion for numerous instruments, which lay there ready for use; and the idle people, with whom his shop was generally crouded, would be perpetually hand∣ling
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>
and misusing them. To remedy which, I suppose, there was placed up against the wall a table of forfeitures, adapted to every offence of this kind; which, it is not likely, would long preserve its authority.</Q></P>
<P>Such is Dr. Warburton's explanation of this passage; which, our editor says, may serve till a better is discovered. He ob∣serves, nevertheless, that
<Q>whoever has seen the instruments of a chirurgeon, knows that they may be very easily kept out of improper hands in a very small box, or in his pocket.</Q>
—The truth is, that the tables of forfeits, hung up in barbers shops, are still extant in some parts of Eng∣land; at least I remember to have seen one about twelve or thirteen years ago, in an excursion from Burlington to North-Allerton in Yorkshire. I think it was either at Malton or at Thirsk, and very probably it is there still. I do not, indeed, recollect the name of the operator, in whose shop it was affixed; but its contents struck me so much on reading, that I believe I can recite them from memory pretty exactly. They do not relate, however, to the handling of chirurgical instruments, but to civility and good behaviour; and seem not injudiciously calculated for a place, where persons of dif∣ferent stations and degrees were accustomed to meet, in order to be successively shaved.

—On this occasion, I cannot help remark∣ing, that it is somewhat singular to find our editor so extremely remiss and negligent in illustrating the beauties of Shakespeare, and so very diligent in discovering his faults. This carping critic is in this particular, however, egregiously mistaken; there being no grounds for charging the poet, in this place, with want of attention to his plot. It is true, that Lucio does not expresly call the duke a coward, in that part of their conversation which passed on the stage, in scene VI. act 3. Our editor might have observed, however, that he hath a farther conversation with him in scene XI. act 4. where he begins again to talk of the <HI>old fantastical duke of dark corners</HI>; and when the duke wants to shake him off, by bidding him farewel, and telling him his <HI>company is fairer than honest,</HI> Lucio will not be thus got rid of, but follows him, saying, <HI>By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of bur, I shall stick.</HI> Is it not very natural to suppose, that Lucio might afterwards call the duke a <HI>coward,</HI> considering the many opprobrious names he had already given him? and is the poet to be censured, because he hath made the Duke charge Lucio with a single word of detraction, which was not actu∣ally spoken before the audience? If this be not hypercriticism, I know not what is. But, to make the matter worse on the part of our unfortunate editor, the Duke doth not charge
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>
Lucio with calling him a coward, at the time when he runs on enumerating his other vices. For this was in the open street, through which the officers passed in carrying the bawds to prison: but the time is particularly specified when he called him <HI>coward,</HI> which was when the duke met him in the pri∣son, and, as I above remarked, could not get rid of him. This is plain from the context.</P>

<SPEAKER>ISAB.</SPEAKER>
<L>Most bounteous, Sir,</L>
<L>Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,</L>
<L>As if my brother liv'd, I partly think,</L>
<L>A due sincerity govern'd his deeds</L>
<L>Till he did look on me; since it is so,</L>
<L>Let him not die.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Johnson hath, in my opinion, a very exceptionable note on this passage. I shall quote it therefore entire, and make my observations on it afterwards.
<Q>The duke has justly ob∣served, that Isabel is <HI>importuned, against all sense,</HI> to solicit for Angelo; yet here, <HI>against all sense,</HI> she solicits for him. Her argument is extraordinary.
<Q><L>A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,</L>
<L>'Till he did look on me; since it is so,</L>
<L>Let him not die.</L></Q>
That Angelo had committed all the crimes charged against him, as far as he could commit them, is evident. The only <HI>intent</HI> which <HI>his act did not overtake,</HI> was the defile∣ment of Isabel. Of this Angelo was only intentionally guilty.—Angelo's crimes were such, as must sufficiently justify punishment, whether its end be to secure the inno∣cent from wrong, or to deter guilt by example; and I be∣lieve every reader feels some indignation when he finds him spared. From what extenuation of his crime can Isa∣bel, who yet supposes her brother dead, form any plea in his favour? <HI>Since he was good till he look'd on me, let him not die.</HI> I am afraid our varlet poet intended to inculcate, that women think ill of nothing that raises the credit of their beauty, and are ready, however virtuous, to pardon any act which they think incited by their own charms.</Q></P>
<P>To expose the several fallacies suggested throughout the above note, I shall observe first, that it was very natural for Mariana to solicit Isabel's intercession for her husband, the man she so much loved. I cannot think also, that it is, in
<PB N="47" REF="62"/>
any respect, out of character for Isabel, after repeated solici∣tations, to be moved to oblige Mariana, who had already obliged her, so far at least as to prevent the apparent neces∣sity of prostituting herself to Angelo: especially if we reflect on the tranquil state of mind she seems to be in with regard to her brother; in whose supposed death she appears to have acquiesced, either from principles of religion or philosophy: for when the Duke, in the foregoing page, speaking of her brother, says,
<Q><L>—Peace be with him!</L>
<L>That life is better life, past fearing death,</L>
<L>Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort.</L>
<L>So, happy is your brother.</L></Q>
Isabel answers,
<Q>I do, my lord.</Q>
From a principle of philosophy, she must be very conscious that the death of Angelo could not bring her brother to life again; and if to this reflection we suppose her religion might add the suggestion of Christian charity and forgiveness, I do not see any impropriety in Isabel's soliciting Angelo's pardon.</P>
<P>As to the argument she makes use of, and which Dr. John∣son thinks so very extraordinary, it is to be observed, that she does not make use of it as a positive plea, but introduces it with
<Q><L>—I PARTLY THINK</L>
<L>A due sincerity, &amp;c.</L></Q>
Again, Dr. Johnson says,
<Q>the only <HI>intent</HI> which <HI>his act did not overtake,</HI> was the defilement of Isabel.</Q>
Surely, Dr. John∣son forgets the intended execution of Claudio! There is no doubt that Angelo's guilty intentions fully deserved punish∣ment; but as the principal of them failed of being carried into execution, I do not see why the reader should feel so much indignation at his being pardoned, especially as he must perceive the propriety of doing poetical justice to the injured Mariana; which would not be the case, if her new-made
<PB N="48" REF="63"/>
husband were to be immediately punished with the severity due to his wicked designs.</P>
<P>As to the sinister meaning he imputes to the poet, of in∣tending a covert satire on the fair sex, I think enough is al∣ready said to exculpate him; I wish, therefore, Dr. Johnson were equally excusable for giving Shakespeare the appellation of <HI>varlet</HI> poet. Our editor can hardly intend here to confine that term to its simple and ancient meaning: for where is the jest or propriety of calling Shakespeare a yeoman, or servant, agreeably to the old meaning of the word <HI>varlet</HI>; which like <HI>fur,</HI> in Latin, it is allowed, originally conveyed no base or opprobrious idea?—And yet, if Dr. Johnson did not use the word in this limited and antiquated sense, what can he mean by calling Shakespeare a mean, sorry, or rascally poet? For this is the modern sense of the word; and in this sense the word <HI>varletry</HI> is inserted in a certain folio dictionary, on the authority of Shakespeare himself.—Perhaps, indeed, Dr. John∣son only meant here to express himself in a strain of wit and pleasantry. If so, let him beware how he attempts to be witty again: for surely never was such an aukward attempt made before! It is not in his nature.</P>

<STAGE>Looking on his palm.</STAGE>
<P>Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table, which doth offer to swear upon a book.—I shall have good fortune. Here's a small trifle of wives, &amp;c.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>This passage hath given the commentators a world of trou∣ble. It seems generally agreed, that Mr. Theobald's ex∣planation is still more inexplicable than the text itself. Dr. Johnson inserts it, however; for what reason I cannot divine, unless it be to swell his book, or to serve as a foil to the su∣perior sagacity of Dr. Warburton and himself, whose notes immediately follow. I shall only quote those of the two latter.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Which doth offer to swear upon a book.</HI>] This nonsense seems to have taken its rise from the accident of a lost line in tran∣scribing the play for the press; so that the passage, for the future, should be printed thus: <HI>Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table, which doth * * * * * offer to swear upon a book I shall have good fortune.</HI> It is impossible to find, again, the lost line; but the lost sense is easy enough—<HI>if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth</HI> [promise good luck, I am mistaken. I durst almost] <HI>offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune.</HI></Q>
Dr. Johnson, after condemning Theobald's note in the severest terms, and informing us that by <HI>table</HI> is meant the palm expanded, goes on very magiste∣rially thus.—
<Q>Dr. Warburton understood the word<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A mighty matter to understand truly! which is familiar to every strolling gypsy, and as well known to every kitchen-wench who can make shift to spell the Egyptian Fortune teller, Palmistry laid open, or the two-penny Chiromancer.</NOTE>, but
<PB N="50" REF="65"/>
puzzles himself, with no great success, in pursuit of the meaning.</Q>
—No wonder at that Dr. Johnson! people seldom <HI>puzzle</HI> themselves with any <HI>great success</HI> in pursuit of any thing.—But to proceed with our editor's note.
<Q>The whole matter is this: Launcelot congratulates himself upon his dexterity and good fortune; and, in the height of his rap∣ture, inspects his hand, and congratulates himself upon the felicities in his table. The act of expounding his hand, puts him in mind of the action in which the palm is shewn, by raising it to lay it on the book, in judicial attestations. <HI>Well,</HI> says he, if any man in Italy have a fairer table, that doth offer to swear upon a book—here he stops with an abruptness very common, and proceeds to particulars.</Q>
—No, Sir, he doth not stop here; but goes on, agreeable to Dr. Warburton's explanation, to say what is to be sworn upon the book, i. e. that he shall have good fortune. But this is not to be sworn either by Launcelot himself, or by any other Italian. It is the hand itself that promises so strongly, and, as it were, offers to swear upon a book, that he shall have good fortune. And in this sense the author of the Revisal takes it; though I think he has not hit off the meaning quite happily. His interpretation is,
<Q>If any man in Italy have a fairer table, which pronounces that I shall have good fortune, with as much assurance as if it was ready to swear it upon a book.—Here, says he, the sentence breaks off, and we must supply, <HI>I am mistaken,</HI> or some other expression of like import.</Q>
—None of these commentators, though very sensible of the break in this passage, seem to know where it lies; but if I might be allowed to take the most trifling liberty in the world with the text, I dare say the reader would see the whole meaning and propriety of it, at one view.—<HI>Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer ta∣ble!—Why, it doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune.—Go to, &amp;c.</HI> Taking the words, also, in this sense, there is a beauty and propriety in saying the palm of∣fers to swear upon a book; because, in judicial attestations,
<PB N="51" REF="66"/>
the essential part of the form lies in <HI>kissing</HI> the book, which the hand may not be improperly said to do, even in laying hold of it. Dr. Johnson, apparently having a con∣fused idea of a court of justice in his head, confounds the action of a criminal holding up his hand at the bar, with that of a witness, qualifying himself by oath, to give evidence against him. The former, indeed, must of course display the palm; but I believe the latter seldom or never does.</P>

<L>Upon my pow'r I may dismiss the court,</L>
<L>Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,</L>
<L>Whom I have sent for to determine this,</L>
<L>Come here to-day.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P><Q><L>Bellario, a learned doctor,</L>
<L>Whom I have sent for.—</L></Q> The doctor and court are here somewhat unskilfully brought together. That the duke would, on such an occasion, consult a doctor of great reputa∣tion, is not unlikely; but how should this be foreknown by Portia?</P></Q>
<P>Why will you, Dr. Johnson, be thus constantly seeking oc∣casion to find fault with Shakespeare, for misconduct in his drama; the business of which you are evidently much too <HI>un∣skilled</HI> in to have a right to take upon you the authority of censuring the <HI>foremost man of all this world?</HI>—You admit it to be right that Dr. Bellario, whom we may very well sup∣pose to be a civilian of the first rank, should be sent for, to
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
advise in this cause. You know too, I imagine (or at least you might have known, if you had read the play) that this same Dr. Bellario (for he was a doctor too; WE are all doc∣tors, Dr. Johnson) was a relation, a cousin, to Portia. This being premised, is it not very natural to suppose that, after Bassanio was called away in such haste to Venice, on account of the prosecution carried on against his friend Anthonio, his bride Portia would send a messenger to her cousin Bellario, in order to ask his opinion of so extraordinary a case, or to in∣terest him in Anthonio's behalf? And can any thing be more probable than that he should inform her, on receiving such a message, that he was actually sent for to Venice on that very account? For it is to be observed, that the duke speaks as if he had sent for him some considerable time before: for he says, <HI>unless Bellario,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>come here to</HI> DAY. His power of dismissing the court also, on his not coming, seems founded on some physical or moral impediment, that might very naturally occur, to prevent his arrival within the time: so that he must be supposed either at such a distance as made it necessary to give him a considerable timely warning, or that the extra∣ordinary nature of the cause might make him require so much the more time to prepare himself equitably to determine it.—This being the state of the case, was not here a very apt foundation on which to build Portia's plot of officiating for the doctor? which design she no doubt concerted with him by letter, before she sent for the notes and cloaths mentioned scene V. act III. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be amiss to observe here, that I have known some spectators impute the device, by which Anthonio evades the penalty of the bond, to the ingenuity of Portia.—Perhaps this is the case, indeed, with the audience in general.—But, as I think it a little out of character, in a young lady of her education, to be so well versed in the quirks and quibbles of the law; so I conceive there is sufficient reason given in the play to suppose that evasion to have been suggested by Bellario.—For she expresly mentions to the messenger <HI>notes</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>aths.</HI> These notes were, doubtless, the brief or hints for her pleading. And Bellario says in his letter to the
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>duke, speaking of the fictitious doctor,
<Q>he is furnished with my opinion.</Q>
So that I am so far from thinking that Shakespeare, as Dr. Johnson supposes, represents Portia to be a prophetess, or a witch, that I conceive his readers in general are apt to think her much more shrewd than he describes her; at least, I dare say, Dr. Johnson's readers will conclude, from this specimen of his sagacity, that whether Portia was a witch or not, he is no conjurer.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="67"/></NOTE>—And that this was really the case seems
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
evident, from what Portia says to Jessica, <HI>during</HI> the <HI>absence</HI> of Bassanio, and <HI>before</HI> she sends Balthazar to Bellario for the notes and clothes.—Jessica compliments her on
<Q><L>—a noble and a true conceit</L>
<L>Of god-like amity; which appears most strongly</L>
<L>In bearing thus the absence of her lord.</L></Q>
A sufficient intimation, I think, that Bassanio must have been gone some time. Again, in Portia's reply to this compli∣ment, she says
<Q><L>—this Anthonio,</L>
<L>Being the bosom-lover of my lord,</L>
<L>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,</L>
<L>How little is the cost I have bestowed,</L>
<L>In purchasing the semblance of my soul</L>
<L>From out the state of hellish cruelty?</L></Q>
Here we find Portia speaking very peremptorily and certainly of Anthonio's deliverance; and of the cost already bestowed to effect it. Is it reasonable to think she would express herself thus confidently on a mere suggestion of her own? Besides, what cost could she have bestowed? Her having bid her hus∣band pay the bond three times over, was nothing; because she could not be sure the money would be taken. Nay, she evidently does not intend to trust to that acceptance. It is therefore, I think, very evident, that she had even at this time concerted the scheme with her cousin Bellario. How far Belmont might be from either Venice or Padua, I cannot ex∣actly say: but it appears from circumstances, that it could not be very far. From Belmont to Venice it seems there was a common traject, or ferry; so that the distance of both from Padua could not be too great for transacting the business
<PB N="54" REF="69"/>
in question.—It is true, that the formality with which Port a introduces her charge to Balthazar, when she sends him for the notes and cloaths, seems to favour the supposition, that this was the first time she had sent to Bellario, in which case there would be some grounds for Dr. Johnson's remark; but we must observe, that Balthazar is now to be intrusted with a more important charge than he had before been, in merely carrying and bringing back a letter; or, it is not unlikely, that Portia entrusted that business with a servant of less im∣portance. All these things duly considered, it is plain, I think, that Dr. Johnson has very rashly and unadvisedly pre∣sumed to call Shakespeare <HI>unskilful,</HI> because he wanted <HI>skill</HI> himself. I shall dismiss this note, therefore, with advising our editor never to wade so far out of his depth for the fu∣ture. It is a trite adage, but it is a very good one, and worthy to be observed; <HI>Ne sutor ultra crepidam.</HI> I do not say that Dr. Johnson may not probably be well skilled in <HI>some</HI> things; not that <HI>I know</HI> that he is well skilled in any <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I will except indeed the article of <HI>literary composition</HI>; in which, so far as the merit of a speech, an essay, a life, or a novel, goes, he is undoubtedly the best writer in Christendom. But his merit even here is in a great measure mechanical, and may be justly ac∣counted for in a manner that will do little honour either to his boasted genius or learning.</NOTE>; for, though I have read <HI>all</HI> his <HI>works,</HI> I declare he does not appear to me (at least so far as I myself am able to judge) to be <HI>master</HI> of any <HI>one science,</HI> or any <HI>one language,</HI> so that he must not plume himself on <HI>my</HI> suffrage. Not that I <HI>deny</HI> him to be master of the <HI>whole circle of sciences,</HI> and of <HI>all languages an∣cient and modern.</HI> But, if it <HI>be</HI> so; if it be really <HI>true,</HI> as his friends inform me, that he is possessed of such amazing stores of literary and scientific knowledge, I cannot help thinking him extremely culpable, not to say very ungrateful, to keep them all avariciously to himself, and fob off the public with mere shreds and patches. How <HI>dare</HI> Dr. Johnson treat <HI>that public</HI> with so much <HI>contempt,</HI> which hath done <HI>him</HI> such extravagant
<PB N="55" REF="70"/>
<HI>honour?</HI> How dare he behave to that public with such im∣paralell'd ingratitude, which hath given him such imparalell'd, such avowed, such unmerited encouragement?—It is true, that its having done all this is sufficient to give Dr. Johnson a very mean opinion of its spirit, taste and judgment. But he should have been aware of carrying the imposition too far; he should not have presumed to think that this public, taste∣less and ignorant as he may suppose it, could ever be pre∣vailed on to grace his waving noddle with a wreath, irreve∣rently torn from the brows of Shakespeare!</P>
<P>The self-sufficient, the arrogant, Dr. Johnson may possibly conceive, that the zeal, with which the very name of Shake∣speare inspires me, is counterfeited; and that I express myself thus warmly, to provoke him to a reply.—No, Dr. John∣son, you <HI>cannot reply.</HI> I must join in that deference, which I think the world hath undeservedly paid you, so far as to own, that I should never have presumed to publish any thing against Dr. Johnson, that I had not good reason to think UNANSWERABLE. It is indeed prudential in <HI>you</HI> to make a virtue of necessity, and previously to give out, that you <HI>will</HI> not do what you have so much reason to think you <HI>can</HI> not do.—Yet you have your satellites, your light-troops; you may send them out to <HI>harrass</HI> the enemy whom you <HI>dare</HI> not <HI>encounter.</HI> But, as I am no farther your enemy than as you are Shakespeare's, send <HI>who</HI> you will, <HI>as many</HI> as you will; I will undertake, under so gallant a leader, to rout an army of scribblers, to crush a myriad of cockle-shell critics, in his cause.</P>

<P><PB N="56" REF="71"/><HI>None but a holy hermit.</HI>] I do not perceive the use of this hermit, of whom nothing is seen or heard afterwards. The poet had first planned his fable some other way, and inad∣vertently, when he changed his scheme, retained something of the original design.</P></Q>
<P>How! the poet blundering again!—Why, what a block∣head this Shakespeare must be, Dr. Johnson? eh!—Nay, if you object to giving the appellation to Shakespeare, we must bestow it on somebody else; the word is blurted out, and can∣not be recalled. Let us see if it will <HI>apply,</HI> as the lawyers say, to the author of the above comment.—</P>
<P>He doth not perceive the use of the hermit, because no∣thing is seen or heard of him afterwards.—Pray is any thing <HI>seen</HI> of him <HI>now?</HI> He is not brought on the scene; and may, for ought that effects the business of the play, exist only in <HI>nubibus.</HI> There is no doubt that the messenger tells a lye, respecting the <HI>employment</HI> of his mistress; and why may he not do the same respecting her <HI>attendants?</HI>—But perhaps the commentator may not see the use of the fiction neither, and will therefore condemn this part of the messenger's lye as un∣necessary. He would do well to recollect, however, that, although nothing is heard about a hermit <HI>afterwards,</HI> a suf∣ficient reason was given <HI>before</HI> to speak of one in this mes∣sage; which is evidently a contrivance of Portia to support the imposition she is carrying on. It is to be remembered that, when Portia takes her leave of Lorenzo and Jessica, putting the management of her house and family in their hands, act III. scene 5. she says
<Q><L>—For mine own part,</L>
<L>I have tow'rd heaven breath'd a secret vow,</L>

Now, having told them this fib at her departure, nothing

could be more pertinent, or indeed necessary, to keep up the probability of the story, than for the messenger to say, she was attended by a hermit; as it would be both unseemly and dangerous for two women <HI>to stray about, kneeling and praying by holy crosses,</HI> without a male attendant; and who so proper on such an occasion as an holy hermit, whose sacred character might protect them from insult?—This is sufficient to shew, that it was not unnecessary, but very pertinent to the plot, to have a hermit here spoken of; which is all the poet hath done.—Add to this, that, after all, it is possible there might really be a hermit in the case, though it was needless that he should appear. For the messenger himself might not be in the plot, and Portia have employed a hermit to deliver him the message from Portia, as he actually did deliver it to Lorenzo; unless we are to suppose that holy hermits are too inflexibly attached to truth, to assist even in so innocent an imposture: which I, who have had the honour of knowing some of those gentry, conceive not to be the case.</P>

It is true they have in general been much more successful in throwing obstructions in the way of the reader, than in obviating those which common sense and simple ingenuity might naturally suggest. For my part, I should never have dreamt that these verses so greatly
<PB N="58" REF="73"/>
needed illustration, that they were corrupted, or that a line was lost and badly restored, unless the learned Dr. Warburton had told me of the first, the ingenious and sensible authors of the Canons of Criticism and of the Revisal had insinuated the second, and lastly, the learned, ingenious and sensible Dr. Johnson attempted to persuade me of the third. In∣deed, they have all successfully laboured to throw some obscu∣rity on the text, Mr. Edwards not excepted; for, though he hath facetiously and justly exposed Dr. Warburton's ridiculous emendation of the fifth line, he hath left the reader to explain the passage himself, after assuring him that it certainly is faulty.</P>
<P>It will, I presume, afford some entertainment to the reader to compare the several notes of these annotators; by which they will see how they have all blundered round-about the poet's meaning; perhaps for no other reason in the world than that they imagined it lay much deeper than it really does. It is not an uncommon thing for persons immoderately saga∣cious to look too far forward, and stumble over what lies im∣mediately under their nose. Dr. Johnson appears, indeed, to have a very different opinion of this matter; and seems to think that Shakespeare's meaning is always very profound. Thus he tells us,
<Q>the original and predominant error of Dr. Warburton's Commentary, is acquiescence in his first thoughts; that precipitation which is produced by consci∣ousness of quick discernment; and that confidence which presumes to do, by surveying the surface, what labour only can perform, by <HI>penetrating the bottom</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to Dr. Johnson's Shakespeare.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>For my part, I had always a very different opinion of Dr. Warburton's Commentary. That he did too precipitately ac∣quiesce in his own thoughts, may be very true; and that he surveyed only the surface of Shakespeare's writing may be no less so; but that he went very deep into the recesses of his own imagination, as well as into his stores of book-learning,
<PB N="59" REF="74"/>
for all those far-fetched allusions, quaint epithets and literary conundrums, which he imputes to Shakespeare, is, I think, not to be doubted. For it is very true, as our editor also ob∣serves, that
<Q>his notes exhibit perverse interpretations and improbable conjectures; he at one time gives the author more profundity of meaning than the sentence admits, and at another discovers absurdities, where the sense is plain to every other reader <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to Dr. Johnson's Shakespeare.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is very natural to conclude, from this reprehension, that Dr. Johnson means to insinuate his having himself repaired the faults of Dr. Warburton, and effected that by perseverance and labour, which the reverend scholiast, his predecessor, failed to do by his vivacity and precipitation. It is certain, that <HI>labour</HI> necessarily takes up <HI>time</HI>; and so far the frequent procrastination of the present edition affords Dr. Johnson a plausible excuse for pretending to have laboured: but, on the other hand, it is as certain that <HI>time</HI> doth not necessarily in∣clude <HI>labour</HI>; for, it is notorious that an industrious gerund-grinder may do as much or more in a month, than an <HI>idler</HI> will do in seven years. It is also farther certain that, although youth and inexperience may be too hasty and precipitate, yet experi∣ence and age cannot well execute their work too expeditiously; in the former case delay may serve to correct errors, and check the inordinance and exuberance of zeal; in the latter, it produces only languor and perplexity. Thus if Dr. Johnson, instead of spiritedly repairing the neglect of those who only <HI>surveyed</HI> the <HI>surface,</HI> had boldly and immediately <HI>penetrated</HI> to <HI>the bottom,</HI> all had possibly been right: but, instead of doing this, it appears he hath been full as much too tardy as they were precipitate; and thus, leaving the weight of his learning, and the force of his reputation, to work their way without the least application of genius, he hath suffered them, by long and constant fric∣tion, to perforate or to <HI>penetrate,</HI> as he says, <HI>the bottom</HI> itself. So that the superficial meanings, which former editors skimmed from the top, are left hanging about the sides of the vessel;
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>
while the profound discoveries, weighty arguments, and striking illustrations, expected in the present edition, are all escaped through the hole which Dr. Johnson's modest industry and vast erudition have worked through the bottom.</P>
<P>But, to leave this digression, and return to the notes of the several commentators. Dr. Warburton's, as it is inserted by way of preference, no doubt, in the page before us, runs thus:</P>
<Q><P><Q><L>Thy tooth is not so keen,</L>
<L>Because thou art not seen,</L></Q> This song is designed to suit the duke's exiled condition, who had been ruined by <HI>un∣grateful flatterers.</HI> Now the <HI>winter wind,</HI> the song says, is to be preferred to <HI>man's ingratitude.</HI> But why? <HI>Because it is not</HI> SEEN. But this was not only an aggravation of the injury, as it was done in secret, <HI>not seen,</HI> but was the very circumstance that made the keenness of the ingratitude of his faithless courtiers. Without doubt Shakespeare wrote the line thus,
<Q><L>Because thou art not <HI>SHEEN,</HI></L></Q>
i. e. smiling, and shining, like an ungrateful court-servant, who flatters while he wounds, which was a very good rea∣son for giving the <HI>winter wind</HI> the preference. So in the Midsummer Night's Dream,
<Q><L>Spangled star light <HI>SHEEN;</HI></L></Q>
and several other places. Chaucer uses it in this sense,
<Q><L>Your blissful suster Lucina the <HI>SHENE.</HI></L></Q>
And Fairfax,
<Q><L>The sacred angel took his target <HI>SHENE,</HI></L>
<L>And by the Christian champion stood unseen.</L></Q>
The Oxford editor, who had this emendation communi∣cated to him, takes occasion from thence to alter the whole line thus,
<Q><L>Thou causest not that teen.</L></Q>
But, in his rage of correction, he forgot to leave the reason, which is now wanting. Why the <HI>winter wind</HI> was to be preferred to <HI>man's ingratitude.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="61" REF="76"/>On this curious comment, the author of the Canons of Criticism hath made the following remarks:</P>
<Q><P>This passage [meaning the two lines quoted from the text] is certainly faulty; and perhaps it cannot be restored, as Shakespeare gave it. Sir Thomas Hanmer at last altered it into sense;
<Q>Thou causest not that teen.</Q>
But this, it seems, will not do; because, in <HI>his rage of cor∣rection,</HI> he forgot to leave the reason, why the <HI>winter wind</HI> was to be preferred to man's ingratitude. So now Mr. Warburton comes with his emendation, which he charit∣ably communicated to Sir Thomas, though he was so graceless as not to make use of it.
<Q>Because thou art not <HI>SHEEN.</HI></Q>
Though this matter is so clear with Mr. Warburton, every body who understands English will doubt of it; be∣cause SHEEN signifies bright, which makes no better sense than seen; nor does he produce any authority for its signi∣fying SMILING, which is the sense he here puts upon it; and to make it pass the better, he lugs in a parcel of <HI>"smiling, shining, court servants, who flatter while they wound,</HI>" of whom there is not the least hint in the song, or in the whole scene.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. Edwards then goes on to enumerate Dr. Warbur∣ton's examples, which having quoted above, need not be repeated.—He proceeds—
<Q>These are the examples he produces; <HI>whether wisely or not, let the forest judge</HI>; but the conceit of a <HI>smiling target</HI> is entirely his own; and, if be will allow me a pun <HI>invita Minerva</HI>; for it seems in direct opposition to the famed Aegis of Pallas. But this is hardly a laughing matter: for with what face can he say <HI>smiling, shining</HI>—so Shakespeare.—Chaucer uses it in this sense,—and Fairfax—when, if he knows any thing of the lan∣guage, he must know, that not one of them, in these in∣stances, uses <HI>sheen</HI> in the sense of SMILING; and that, in
<PB N="62" REF="77"/>
its true sense of BRIGHT or shining, it would make the passage worse than he found it?</Q></P>
<P><Q>If Sir Thomas Hanmer, as he says, took occasion, from having this emendation communicated to him, to alter the whole line; he shewed more judgment than if he had inserted such a false and nonsensical note; but, "in his rage of correction, he forgot to leave the reason, why the winter wind was to be preferred to <HI>man's ingratitude.</HI>" If SHEEN does not signify <HI>smiling,</HI> I doubt Mr. Warburton will be in the same case. However Shakespeare has equally forgotten, in the next stanza, to leave the reason why a freezing sky is to be preferred to a <HI>forgetful friend</HI>; which, perhaps, may give a reasonable suspicion that the word <HI>be∣cause</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ingenious writer does not intimate what he thinks might be the right word; but if he be right in his suspicion, I conceive that, instead of the conjunction copulative <HI>because,</HI> Shakespeare must use the adverb or preposition disjunctive <HI>beside.</HI></NOTE>, in the first stanza, may be corrupt.</Q></P>
<P>The author of the REVISAL of <HI>Shakespeare's Text,</HI> says,
<Q>What the meaning of the common reading,
<Q>Because thou art not SEEN,</Q>
may be, it is extremely difficult to discover, which gives great ground for suspicion that it may be corrupt. Possibly it might be intended to be this: the impressions thou makest on us are not so cutting, because thou art an unseen agent, with whom we have not the least acquaintance or converse, and therefore have the less reason to repine at thy treat∣ment of us.</Q></P>
<P>To come now to Dr. Johnson; who, after quoting Dr. Warburton's note, without mentioning a syllable of Mr. Ed∣wards's remarks on it, proceeds thus:
<Q>I am afraid that no reader is satisfied with Dr. Warburton's emendation, how∣ever vigorously enforced; and it is indeed enforced with more art than truth. <HI>Sheen,</HI> i. e. <HI>smiling, shining.</HI> That <HI>sheen</HI> signifies <HI>shining,</HI> is easily proved; but when or where
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
did it signify <HI>smiling?</HI> Yet <HI>smiling</HI> gives the sense necessary in this place. Sir Thomas Hanmer's change is less uncouth, but too remote from the present text. For my part, I question whether the original is not lost, and this substituted merely to fill up the measures and the rhyme. Yet even out of this line, by strong agitation, may sense be elicited, and sense not unsuitable to the occasion. <HI>Thou winter wind,</HI> says the duke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No, Dr. Johnson, it is his cousin Amiens <HI>sings</HI> it.</NOTE>, <HI>thy rudeness gives the less pain, as thou art not seen, as thou art an enemy that dost not brave us with thy presence, and whose unkindness is therefore not aggravated by insult.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After so many avowed assurances of the difficulty of the above passage, and the unsuccessful, though elaborate, at∣tempts to clear it up; it may seem affectation in me to insist on its being very obvious. I must declare, however, that before I had read any of the above criticisms, it always seemed so, though I must own I did not take either the particular meaning of the words, or the general design of the song, in the same manner as is done by any of the above-mentioned critics. Dr. Warburton seems, indeed, to have misled them all, by confounding ingratitude with pretended friendship or private enmity. That flatterers are often secret enemies, and generally ungrateful, is very true; but it is by no means es∣sential to acts of ingratitude that they should be committed in secret; and, on the contrary, though it be disingenuous, mean, and cowardly to do private injuries, it may not be ungrateful; for the doer may happen not be obliged to the person offended. With regard also to the particular case be∣fore us, there is no doubt but the banished duke had suffered enough from public and <HI>visible</HI> acts of ingratitude: the wick∣edness of which would therefore be aggravated, as Dr. John∣son rightly says, by insult; and would not be, like acts of false friendship or private enmity, aggravated by being done
<PB N="64" REF="79"/>
in secret. When Dr. Johnson, therefore, adopting Dr. War∣burton's reasoning, tells us that <HI>smiling</HI> gives the sense neces∣sary in this place, he is misled by the plausibility of that gen∣tleman's argument; there being no manner of occasion, as Mr. Edwards observes, for the introduction of his flattering courtiers.</P>
<P>Having expatiated so much on the difficulty and misappre∣hension of the passage, I come now to explain it that way in which I have ever understood it; and according to which, I think, there is no manner of difficulty in reconciling the sense to the words as they now stand. Nay, I flatter myself many readers will discover more beauty in this admirable lit∣tle song, than they were before acquainted with. Before I enter, however, on the explanation of particular words, I shall consider the design and tendency of the song in general. To this end it may be necessary to repeat the whole.
<Q><LG>
<L>Blow, blow, thou winter wind,</L>
<L>Thou art not so unkind</L>
<L>As man's ingratitude;</L>
<L>Thy tooth is not so keen,</L>
<L>Because thou art not seen,</L>
<L>Although thy breath be rude.</L>
<L>Heigh ho! sing heigh ho! &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,</L>
<L>That dost not bite so nigh</L>
<L>As benefits forgot:</L>
<L>Though thou the waters warp,</L>
<L>Thy sting is not so sharp</L>
<L>As friends remember'd not.</L>
<L>Heigh ho! sing heigh ho! &amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q>
The reader will observe that the <HI>first</HI> verse is addressed to the WIND, and the <HI>second</HI> to the SKY; by which latter is evi∣dently <HI>meant</HI> the air or atmosphere, as appears by the attri∣tributes or qualities he imputes to it. It is observable, far∣ther,
<PB N="65" REF="80"/>
that the poet has, with great judgment, kept the pro∣perties and effects of both distinct, beginning with the least hurtful, and proceeding regularly in the climax to the most cutting and severe.</P>
<P>This being premised, I come now to the disputed meaning of the particular words: and here all the scholiasts seem to blunder, in mistaking the sense of the word <HI>keen</HI> in the fourth line; which they take to signify <HI>sharp, cutting, piercing</HI>; whereas it only means <HI>eager, vehement</HI>; a sense equally com∣mon with the former. The poet speaks here only of a keen∣ness of appetite; he does not mention actual biting, till he comes to address a more proper and powerful agent: for, tho' it be the property of the wind to bluster and make a noise, it doth not bite, unless it bring with it a nipping frosty air. It does not freeze more in an high wind, than when its breath is neither felt nor heard; but often less. Besides, if <HI>keen</HI> here means <HI>sharp, piercing,</HI> &amp;c. this line hath the same meaning as the seventh line of the second verse, where the poet is at the last stage of his climax. And I think he would hardly be guilty of such a piece of tautology, in the space of so few lines, or ad∣dress the less severe and powerful agent exactly in the same manner as he does that which is more so.</P>
<P>Taking the word in this sense, let us see its effect on the context.</P>
<Q>Thy tooth is not so keen.</Q>
<P>That is as much as to say, <HI>thou art not so eager to</HI> bite; <HI>thy appetite is not so voracious—thou art not so violent to distress us.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Because thou art not seen,</L>
<L>Although thy breath be rude.</L></Q>
<P>In other words, <HI>because thou dost not come in a visible form to confront us, notwithstanding thou insultest us with thy abusive blustering.—Thou dost not shew thy grim</HI> LOOKS, <HI>though we hear thy roaring</HI> VOICE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shakespeare uses <HI>breath</HI> for <HI>voice</HI> also in the Twelfth-Night; SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK. I had rather than forty shillings, I had so sweet a <HI>breath</HI> to <HI>sing,</HI> as the fool has.</NOTE>.—The sight of those who have behaved to

us with ingratitude is known to be particularly disgustful, even though we should despise any thing they should say or do when out of our presence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus Adam to his <HI>ingrateful Eve,</HI> in Milton's Paradise Lost, Out of my SIGHT, thou serpent!</NOTE>. It were indeed extremely offensive to see others <HI>shew their teeth</HI> at us, even though they could not bite. Perhaps Shakespeare had some distant allusion to this prover∣bial phrase: it is also observable, that the invisibility of the wind was a circumstance which this great poet had frequently in his mind. Thus, in Measure for Measure, he speaks of the <HI>viewless</HI> winds; an epithet, I believe, peculiar to himself.</P>
<P>I now trust this explanation to the reader's judgment, and should also take leave of the subject itself, were there not an expression in the last stanza; the beauty of which is, in a great measure, lost, for want of being rightly understood.—I have not undertaken, indeed, to supply the defects of the commentators; but as this song is a favourite, I cannot pro∣ceed without making a slight animadversion or two on this head. The expression I mean is,
<Q>Though thou the waters WARP.</Q>
The word <HI>warp</HI> has been very differently used by different writers: it is used by some to mean <HI>contract</HI> or <HI>shrivel,</HI> to <HI>turn aside,</HI> &amp;c. and a certain lexicographer, in his folio dic∣tionary, quotes this very line to shew that it is used to express the effects of frost. But may we not pertinently ask him, what these effects are? Does he mean to say, that Shakespeare hath used it here in a sense different from its most general and obvious meaning? If he does, he does not understand the poet; if he does not, he knows not how to write a dictionary. To <HI>warp,</HI> here means neither to <HI>contract,</HI> nor to <HI>turn aside</HI>; for the body of water in freezing is dilated, not contracted; and though the frost may arrest or stop water in its passage, I don't know that it alters its course.</P>
<P>The word <HI>waters,</HI> indeed, doth not mean here, as some have supposed, water in the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stract, as a fluid in general; it means also neither the waving, <HI>multitudinous,</HI> sea, nor the ra∣pid
<PB N="67" REF="82"/>
unfreezing rivers, but such inland pools, lakes, and other stagnant or slowly-moving pieces of water that are subject to be affected by frost <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Agreeable to this, when the rivers break down or run over their banks, laying the country under water, we say the <HI>waters</HI> are out. When the river is returned again to its channel also, the pools remaining behind in the adjacent fields or meadows, are called the <HI>waters.</HI></P></NOTE>. Now, it is well known that the surface of such <HI>waters,</HI> as is here meant, so long as they remain fluid, i. e. unfrozen, is apparently a perfect plane; whereas when they are frozen, this surface deviates from its exact flatness, or <HI>warps.</HI> This is peculiarly remarkable in small ponds, the surface of which, when frozen, forms a regular concave; the ice on the sides rising higher than that in the middle. Thus we see that Shakespeare need not to be obliged to any lexicographer for admitting the latitude of his expres∣sion, as he here uses the word <HI>warp</HI> in its primitive and most general signification; to make a thing <HI>cast</HI> or <HI>bend,</HI> as boards do when they are cut before they are thoroughly dry, or when they are put to the fire.</P>

<P>I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock∣pigeon over his hen; more clamorous than a parrot against rain; more new-fangled than an ape; more giddy in my desires than a monkey; I will weep for no∣thing, like <HI>Diana</HI> in the fountain; and I will do that, when you are disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when you are inclined to <HI>sleep.</HI></P>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton says,
<Q>that instead of the last word <HI>sleep,</HI> we should read <HI>weep:</HI></Q>
to this reading, however, Dr. John∣son objects.
<Q>I know not, says he, why we should read <HI>to weep.</HI> I believe must men would be more angry to have their <HI>sleep</HI> hindered than their grief interrupted.</Q></P>
<P>What our editor suggests is certainly very true, especially of persons addicted to somnolency; but if the poet intended the antithesis Dr. Warburton seems to suppose, I should rather read <HI>weep:</HI> but then the construction of the sentence will not do. Instead of saying, <HI>I will laugh like a hyen, and that when you are inclined to weep</HI>; the <HI>and</HI> should be transposed, and the word <HI>that</HI> omitted. He should have said, AND <HI>I will</HI> LAUGH <HI>like a hyen, when you are inclined to</HI> WEEP. Supposing the text uncorrupted in no other particular, I must give my voice, with the editor, for <HI>sleep.</HI> But I cannot help suspecting that this passage is corrupted in a part where none of the commenta∣tors seem to think it. It is justly to be presumed, at least, that Dr. Johnson does not think it so, as he passes it over, notwithstanding he assures us, in his preface, that he hath left not one passage, that he thought obscure, without attempt∣ing to elucidate it.</P>
<P>But what shall we say to Rosalind's <HI>laughing like a</HI> HYEN? If by a <HI>hyen</HI> is meant an <HI>hyaena,</HI> I do not know what authority we have for its <HI>laughing,</HI> nor can discover the propriety of the allusion. It is reported, indeed, of that furious animal,
<PB N="69" REF="84"/>
that it will counterfeit a man's voice; nay, call him by his name, to entice him out of doors, in order to devour him; after which he may be said, metaphorically, to <HI>laugh in his sleeve</HI> at the success of his contrivance. But the laughing here alluded to, must be necessarily so loud as to prevent a drowsy man's going to sleep; and I do not know that any animal in nature is possessed of the streperous part of risibility, except <HI>man.</HI>
<Q><HI>Homo</HI> est animal <HI>risibile,</HI></Q>
and I believe exclusively so. Shakespeare then can never mean to say, <HI>like an hyaena.</HI></P>
<P>"What then could he mean?"—True, reader, that is the question.—Have but a little patience and I will endeavour to tell you.—Shakespeare, with all his diversity of action and character, is generally very uniform and constant in his train of thinking. He does not chop his metaphors into fritters; nor skip giddily and alternately from the allusions of art to those of nature, or vicê versâ. The reader will please to observe, that, in the preceding line, and in this very sen∣tence, he mentions <HI>Diana.</HI> Now, it is not at all like Shakes∣peare to fly off immediately from this classical allusion, to so distant a one as any afforded by natural history; even suppo∣sing there were not that impropriety in it as I have above noticed.</P>
<P>I would venture, after the modish way of deciding argu∣ments, to lay a good bet, if it could be determined, that Shakespeare wrote thus;</P>
<P>—<HI>I will</HI> WEEP <HI>for nothing like</HI> DIANA <HI>in the fountain; and I will do that, when you are disposed to be</HI> MERRY: <HI>I will</HI> LAUGH <HI>like a</HI> HYAD, <HI>and that when you are inclined to</HI> SLEEP.</P>
<P>The word <HI>laugh</HI> in the last part of the sentence being used, by way of irony, for CRY; thus we ironically say, <HI>to laugh like Heraclitus,</HI> the weeping philosopher <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Or, according to the vulgar phrase, to <HI>laugh on the wrong side of the mouth.</HI> But if any of my readers should make objections to the supposed use of the figure above-mentioned, and be willing to look over the defect of construction in the text, in favour of Dr. Warburton's proposed alteration, they may take the word in its natural sense; in which case, <HI>to laugh like a</HI> HYAD, would mean, as another vulgar phrase has it, to <HI>laugh till she cries.</HI> In either case, however, it must be <HI>hyad,</HI> and not <HI>hyen</HI>: this latter reading being entirely excluded for the reasons above given. By substituting the former also we make both the allusions classical, and preserve that conformity of thinking, which is perfectly agreeable to the genius of Shakespeare; who, it is very possible, came from reading Ovid, to compose many scenes in this play. It is certain his head was so full of him, that he mentions his very name in one of the scenes, where neither the occasion, nor the turn of the dialogue, gave the least room for it. <HI>I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.</HI></P></NOTE>: so that to <HI>laugh like a
<PB N="70" REF="85"/>
hyad,</HI> is to <HI>sob and blubber like one of the hyads.</HI> Now <HI>hyads,</HI> or <HI>hyades,</HI> is an appellation given to the constellation, other∣wise called the <HI>seven stars,</HI> and suposed to be a watery sign; whence their denomination from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. to rain. The poets feign these <HI>hyads</HI> to have been the daughters of Atlas and Aethra; and pretend that <HI>Hyas,</HI> their brother, having been torn to pieces by a lioness, they wept so vehemently for his death, that the gods, in compassion to them, translated them to heaven, and placed them in the forehead of the bull, where they still continue to weep: whence the constellation is supposed by some to presage rain.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that some of my readers will think this comment written rather too much in the <HI>Warburtonian</HI> strain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is not impossible also, that some superficial critics may think, that a man could not be kept awake by a woman's weeping. But certainly, if she blubbered and roared heartily, and out of spite, as is here supposed, he might as well be kept awake by her <HI>crying</HI> as her <HI>laughing.</HI> Besides, if we reflect on the shrewd veracity of the old proverb, that says,
<Q>Women <HI>laugh</HI> when they <HI>can,</HI> and <HI>weep</HI> when they <HI>will</HI>;</Q>
I conceive that Rosalind, in mentioning the several acts of her <HI>wil∣fulness,</HI> speaks only of her <HI>weeping.</HI></P></NOTE>. But, if it be just and pertinent, I think this should be no ob∣jection
<PB N="71" REF="86"/>
to it; for, though Dr. Warburton's comments on Shakespeare are seldom to the purpose, and therefore do not always deserve our approbation, they are generally learned, and never fail to excite our <HI>admiration,</HI> either on account of their actual <HI>ingenuity</HI> or most palpable <HI>absurdity.</HI></P>

<Q>EPILOGUE. If it be true, that <HI>good wine needs no bush,</HI> 'tis true, that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor can in∣sinuate with you in the behalf of a good play?</Q>
<P><Q>Here, says Dr. Johnson, seems to be a chasm or some other depravation, which destroys the sentiment <HI>here</HI> intended. The reasoning probably stood thus, <HI>Good wine needs no bush, good plays need no epilogue,</HI> but bad wine requires a good bush, and a bad play a good epilogue. <HI>What case am I in then?</HI> To restore the words is impossible; all that can be done without copies is, to note the fault.</Q>
—Happy is it for the memory of Shakespeare, and as happy for his discerning readers, that the veneration paid to his name sometimes pre∣vents the hand of the commentator from executing those designs which his temerity conceives. What work would not a critic, of less modesty than our editor, make of this passage, should he take it in his head to supply what is thus supposed wanting? Yet how easily is the whole set right! It can hardly be called a <HI>supposition</HI> that Shakespeare wrote <HI>tho</HI>' instead of <HI>then</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That a transcriber might make such a mistake, is also as likely, as that he should write <HI>tho</HI>' for <HI>then,</HI> as, Dr. Johnson supposes, is done in King John, page 410.</NOTE>. It is obvious he must, as he plays on the word <HI>good</HI> all through the passage, not once introducing the epithet <HI>bad,</HI> made use of by Dr. Johnson, nor hinting at the antithesis, which the editor conceives so necessary to the sense. <HI>Tho</HI>', at the end of a sentence, is commonly used in discourse for <HI>however,</HI> and
<PB N="72" REF="87"/>
has the same meaning as <HI>but</HI> at the beginning of it. Thus it is the same thing as if the speaker had said, BUT <HI>what a case am I in, &amp;c.</HI> Let the reader substitute these words for <HI>what a case am I in</HI> THEN, and I dare say he will conceive with me there is no chasm in the passage; but that it stands as Shake∣speare wrote it. Be this, however, as it may, what is sub∣stituted by Dr. Johnson is entirely foreign to the purpose. It does by no means follow that, because <HI>good wine needs no bush,</HI> bad wine requires a good one. Good wine will recommend itself, and sell without a bush; but we do not thence infer, that the goodness of any bush can recommend or sell bad wine.—The Bermudans, I am told, when they go fishing, never trouble themselves to carry any oil or butter for sauce; for if they catch a fat fish it <HI>requires</HI> none, and if they catch a lean one it <HI>deserves</HI> none.—Shakespeare, I fancy, by saying nothing about either bad wine or bad plays, reasoned about them both as the Bermudans do about their fish.</P>

<L>How well he's read to reason against reading!</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton and Dr. Johnson, having both exerted their critical abilities on this passage, and, as I think, left it worse than they found it, I shall insert the annotations of both, as I find them printed in the pages before me.</P>
<Q><PB N="73" REF="88"/><P><Q><L>Too much to know is to know nought but <HI>FAME;</HI></L>
<L>And every god-father can give a name.</L></Q> The first line in this reading is absurd and impertinent. There are two ways of setting it right. The first is to read thus,
<Q>Too much to know is to know nought but <HI>SHAME.</HI></Q>
This makes a fine sense, and alludes to Adam's fall, which came from the inordinate passion of knowing too much. The other way is to read, and point it thus,
<Q>Too much to know, is to know nought: but <HI>FEIGN, i. e.</HI> to feign.</Q>
As much as to say, the affecting to know too much is the way to know nothing. The sense in both these readings is equally good: but with this difference; if we read the first way, the following line is impertinent, and, to save the correction, we must judge it spurious. If we read it the second way, then the following line compleats the sense. Consequently the correction of <HI>feign</HI> is to be preferred. <HI>To know too much</HI> (says the speaker) <HI>is to know nothing; it is only</HI> FEIGNING <HI>to know what we do not; giving</HI> NAMES <HI>for things without knowing their</HI> NATURES; <HI>which is</HI> FALSE <HI>knowledge</HI>: and this was the peculiar defect of the peripa∣tetic philosophy then in vogue. These philosophers, the poet, with the highest humour and good sense, calls <HI>the god-fathers of nature,</HI> who could only give things a <HI>name,</HI> but had no manner of acquaintance with their essences.</P></Q>
<P>On the above annotation, Dr. Johnson observes,
<Q>that there being <HI>two ways of setting a passage right,</HI> gives reason to suspect that there may be a third way better than either. The first of these emendations <HI>makes a fine sense,</HI> but will not unite with the next line; the other makes a sense less fine, and yet will not rhyme to the correspondent word. I cannot see why the passage may not stand without distur∣bance. <HI>The consequence,</HI> says Biron, <HI>of too much knowledge,</HI> is not any real solution of doubts, but mere empty <HI>repu∣tation</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In our editor's appendix, speaking of this passage, he points, reads, and explains thus;
<Q><L>Too much to know is to know nought, but fame;</L>
<L>And every god-father can give a name.</L></Q>
<Q>That is, too much knowledge gives only fame, a name which every god-father can give likewise.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="89"/>The author of the Revisal hath a very long note on this passage; rejecting the emendations proposed by Dr. Warbur∣ton, and seeming to coincide with the opinion of Dr. Johnson. His explanation of the passage is this.
<Q>Too eager a pursuit of knowledge is rewarded, not with the real possession of its object, but only with the reputation of having attain∣ed it.</Q></P>
<P>It is really surprizing to me, that these several critics should be so much at a loss to comprehend, what I conceive the con∣text renders very plain; without making any alteration in the text, as it stood before Dr. Warburton meddled with it, viz.
<Q><L>Too much to know, is to know nought but fame;</L>
<L>And every god-father can give a name.</L></Q>
I cannot imagine what put it into the head of Dr. Johnson, or of the author of the Revisal, that <HI>fame</HI> here means <HI>repu∣tation.</HI> And, supposing it does, what can Dr. Johnson mean by saying, that <HI>too much knowledge gives only fame, a name which every god-father can give likewise?</HI> What, because every god-father can call a child N or M, is he able therefore to give him a literary reputation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This puts me in mind of a certain French bookseller; who, speaking of the profession to which he intended to bring up an igno∣rant booby of a son; <HI>By-gar,</HI> says he, <HI>Monsieur, I will make him one author; he shall be the first writer of the age. Morbleu, he shall be une philosophe; une Voltaire!</HI></P></NOTE>? or is Dr. Johnson so careless of his pointing, as to mean to say that reputation is a mere name? Or, farther, how can <HI>to know nought but fame</HI> mean to <HI>acquire</HI> nothing but <HI>reputation?</HI> Be all this, however, as it may, <HI>fame</HI> means here nothing more than <HI>report, rumour</HI> or
<PB N="75" REF="90"/>
<HI>relation.</HI> Biron is declaiming against <HI>reading,</HI> or the mere study of books. Little, says he,
<Q><L>—have continual plodders ever won,</L>
<L>Save base authority from others' books:</L></Q>
the authors of which books he calls
<Q><L>—earthly god-fathers of heaven's lights,</L>
<L>That give a name to every fixed star.</L></Q>
Now, continues he,
<Q><L>Too much to know, is to know nought but <HI>fame</HI>;</L>
<L>And every god-father can give a name.</L></Q>
To all which the king replies, by observing to another noble∣man, how well Biron is <HI>read,</HI>
<Q>—to reason against READING.</Q>
Hence, I think it is plain that Biron means, through the whole passage, to inculcate a maxim, which is undoubtedly a very true one, viz. that the greatest readers are not the most scientific; the knowledge of things and of words being as different, as the study of nature and the plodding over books. From the latter, people may acquire a heap of indigested lite∣rature, without having any real knowledge at all: indeed, their too great attention to philological pursuits, or to words, often prevents their knowing any thing of philosophy or of things. Add to this, that the knowledge acquired from books, is, for the most part, founded on the authority of the writer, and what is thus known, is known only by <HI>report</HI> or <HI>relation.</HI> So that those, whose whole stock of knowledge consists in what they have read, merely in the learned lumber of their memory, may, with great propriety, be said to know nothing but what is told them; that is, to be entirely ignorant of <HI>facts,</HI> and <HI>to know nothing but</HI> FAME It would be absurd also, to the last degree, to say, that <HI>to know</HI> TOO MUCH <HI>would be to know</HI> NOTHING, if no difference in the kind of knowledge was intended. Again, the last line of Biron's speech evidently refers to what he had just before said, concerning the <HI>base
<PB N="76" REF="91"/>
authority</HI> of books. The authors can give <HI>names,</HI> says he, to things; instancing those,
<Q>That give a name to every fixed star,</Q>
though they profit no more by them, and know nothing far∣ther about them, than those who are ignorant of those names. And this being all they can do, he may well call their wri∣tings <HI>base authority,</HI> and say that any body can do as much, for
<Q>—Every god-father can give a <HI>name,</HI></Q>
which is as much at least as astronomers do by the stars.</P>
<P>The author of the Revisal seems to think the word <HI>fame,</HI> in this place, hath some reference to the king's speech at the commencement of the play; when he proposes <HI>reputation</HI> as the principal aim and motive of their studies.
<Q><L>Let <HI>Fame,</HI> that all hunt after in their lives,</L>
<L>Live register'd upon our brazen tombs;</L>
<L>And then grace us in the disgrace of death:</L>
<L>When, spight of cormorant devouring time,</L>
<L>Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy</L>
<L>That honour which shall 'bate his scythe's keen edge;</L>
<L>And make us heirs of all eternity.</L></Q>
But admitting this, I cannot see any reason to think that <HI>fame,</HI> in the passage disputed, hath precisely the same meaning as in that just quoted, unless both speeches had been spoken by the king.—It is not unlikely that this passage refers to the <HI>fame</HI> recommended by the king; but it is very unlikely that the speaker should affect to set a greater value on <HI>knowledge</HI> than on that <HI>fame,</HI> which was at first proposed as the ultimate end to be attained by it.—It is, in my opinion, more than probable that Biron the speaker, who is evidently a wit, and rails at book-learning, takes the advantage here of the equi∣vocal use of the word <HI>fame</HI>; to sneer at the king's proposing celebrity as the end of his studies: in which case the contested line might be paraphrased thus; <HI>To spend all your time in getting to know only the</HI> names <HI>of things, and what others report about
<PB N="77" REF="92"/>
them, is the way to get</HI> nothing <HI>else but</HI> fame <HI>sure enough!</HI> Indeed, Biron seems to be a man of such a kidney, as to reason about <HI>literary fame</HI> as Falstaff does about <HI>military ho∣nour,</HI> and could easily resolve it in like manner by a trim reckoning, into a very word, air, a mere empty <HI>report.</HI></P>

</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Johnson tells us in his preface, that, when he inserts any of Dr. Warburton's proposed emendations in the text, he means to give them his highest approbation. Now, this he hath done in the present instance; giving that scholiast's note likewise at the bottom of the page. The note is as follows:</P>
<P><Q>—<HI>Taken</HI> WITH <HI>the manner.</HI>] The following question arising from these words, shews we should read—<HI>taken</HI> IN <HI>the manner.</HI> And this was the phrase in use to signify <HI>taken in the fact.</HI> So Dr. Donne, in his letters, <HI>But if I melt into melancholy while I write, I shall be taken</HI> IN <HI>the manner; and I sit by one too tender to these impressions.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The author of the Canons of Criticism, however, hath in∣validated what Dr. Warburton advances in this place, by an∣other of his own notes on a passage in the first part of Henry the Fourth, where the same expression occurs; and on which the same reverend commentator says:
<Q>The quarto and folio read <HI>with the manner,</HI> which is right. <HI>Taken with the manner</HI> is a law phrase, and then in use to signify <HI>taken in the fact.</HI></Q>
—Mr. Edwards observed, on remarking this in∣consistency, that "Great wits have short memories." But I am at some loss to know to what I should impute Dr. John∣son's <HI>giving the highest approbation</HI> to this blunder of Dr. War∣burton's. That his memory is at least as bad, and his atten∣tion full as little, is evident from his quoting both these con∣tradictory
<PB N="78" REF="93"/>
notes in their respective places, and his giving the highest approbation to both the contradictory emendations, by inserting them in the text; one in the play before us, and the other in that of Henry IV. Notwithstanding the inconsistency had been pointed out in a book, that hath run through at least six editions. To what can we impute such servile transcription? Shall we set it down among Dr. John∣son's other concessions to the <HI>respect due to high place, and his veneration for genius and learning?</HI> Or shall we rather impute it to his indolence in not consulting the Canons of Criti∣cism?—Or perhaps he would neither chuse to depend on the authority of that writer, nor even on Dr. Warburton's himself, against the united suffrage of Dr. Warburton and Dr. Donne. He might have depended, however, on the farther authority of Shakespeare; which he might have had by turning over a few pages more of the volume before us; the Clown in the Winter's Tale using the same phrase, thus, <HI>Your worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourself</HI> WITH <HI>the manner.</HI></P>
<P>My readers will hardly doubt, on this representation of the case, that the common phrase was <HI>taken</HI> WITH <HI>the manner.</HI> As to the certainty of its being adopted here, however, it may possibly be still disputed. Dr. Warburton says, Biron's question, immediately succeeding, shews that Costard should say IN <HI>the manner.</HI> For my part I cannot see the force of this reason, though I can very well see why Biron should not re∣peat WITH <HI>the manner,</HI> because of another law phrase, with which Costard answers him, viz. IN <HI>manner and form follow∣ing.</HI> Now this could not be, with any propriety, WITH <HI>man∣ner and form following.</HI> But I think there is no impropriety in supposing that Biron, not attending to the quaintness of Costard's expression, asks him simply and naturally IN <HI>what manner</HI>? notwithstanding Costard had used the phrase WITH <HI>what manner.</HI> Be all this, however, as it may, we have here a very flagrant instance, IN <HI>what manner</HI> Dr. Johnson
<PB N="79" REF="94"/>
hath commented on Shakespeare, and WITH <HI>what manners</HI> he hath treated the public, who encouraged him in this un∣dertaking.</P>

The matter, indeed, he owns is not great; but one would wish, he says, for some meaning or other. I wonder, when he was in the humour to descend to such trifles, he should pass over the word <HI>l'envoy,</HI> which is so often repeated in this and the next page. I dare say not one <HI>reader</HI> of Shakespeare in a hundred, and perhaps not all his <HI>commentators,</HI> know very well what to make of it.

<P>All this is plain and intelligible enough; every English reader also might learn from Boyer, that <HI>envoy</HI> meant the conclusion of a ballad or sonnet; from which he might be led to mistake

it for the mere burthen of a song.—But why should the coup∣lets of a song, or the explanation of an enigma, be called the <HI>envoy?</HI> The case was this—during the institution of the <HI>Jeux Floraux,</HI> or poetical contests, which formerly existed in France, the sonnets or verses of the several candidates for the prize, always closed with an address to the prince, or umpire, who determined their merit, and to whom each was accord∣ingly <HI>sent</HI> [envoiè] whence the name; and hence this part of the composition was usually the most studied and highly finished, in order to induce the arbiter to bestow the prize on the author.</P>

<STAGE>Looking at her glass, and giving the Forester money.</STAGE></Q>
<P><Q>To understand, says our editor, how the princess has her glass so ready at hand in a casual conversation, it must be remembered, that in those days it was the fashion among the French ladies to wear a looking-glass, <HI>as Mr.</HI> BAYLE <HI>coarsely represents it,</HI> ON THEIR BELLIES; that is, to have a small mirrour, set in gold, hanging at the girdle, by which they occasionally viewed their faces, or adjusted their hair.</Q>
—As Mr. Johnson is almost always above referring particularly to his authorities, I cannot readily turn to the passage in Bayle where he makes this <HI>coarse representation.</HI> I am greatly apt to suspect, however, from the opinion I have of Mons. Bayle's usual propriety and elegance, that our editor hath mistaken his meaning. It appears to me that, if these mirrors were hanging at the girdle, they would have been rather repre∣sented as worn at the <HI>side,</HI> than <HI>on the belly,</HI> as the watch and <HI>etui</HI> are at present. Add to this, that if the ribbon or chain, by which they were hung, was so long as to permit the wearer to adjust her hair, without taking it quite off (as is reasonable to
<PB N="81" REF="96"/>
suppose) it could hardly be suspended at the girdle; for in that case such glasses would hang down to the knee, and could not, with any propriety, be said to be worn on the belly. I imagine, therefore, these mirrors were suspended from the neck, or somehow fastened to the drapery covering the sto∣mach and breast; in which case, Mr. Bayle might say, with∣out the least inelegance, they were worn <HI>sur le ventre.</HI> For I will venture to say it is, from his using the word <HI>ventre</HI> on this occasion, that Dr. Johnson charges him with <HI>coarseness</HI>; but <HI>ventre</HI> doth not always signify the <HI>belly.</HI></P>
<P>The French distinguish between the stomach and belly, by calling the former the <HI>petit-ventre,</HI> or VENTRE SUPERIEUR; and the latter the <HI>bas-ventre.</HI> The general term is also fre∣quently used instead of POITRINE, and as often means the <HI>stomach</HI> and <HI>breast,</HI> as it doth the <HI>belly.</HI>—Vaugelas will tell him also, that the word <HI>ventre</HI> is used with great elegance in metaphorical writing. Thus, <HI>passer sur le ventre à son en∣nemi,</HI> is an approved phrase for <HI>giving an enemy a total defeat.</HI> The French, in like manner, use the word <HI>entrailles,</HI> in such phrases as, literally translated, would be very <HI>coarse</HI> and dis∣gusting to an English ear. To instance only one or two. <HI>Seigneur, votre loi est gravéee dans le fond de mes entrailles.</HI>—<HI>Les entrailles de la misericorde de Dieu.</HI> One of the most ele∣gant French writers, now living, also calls the natural affec∣tion of a parent for his child, <HI>l'amour des entrailles.</HI> But what should we think of an English critic, who should translate such passages thus: <HI>Thy law, O Lord, is engraven in our guts—The entrails of the mercy of God—The affection of the bowels</HI>—and thence take occasion to censure the writer for <HI>coarse∣ness</HI> and inelegance?</P>
<P>We are informed, by some letters lately published <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the St. James's Chronicle, and other news-papers; as also the monthly magazines.</NOTE>, that when Dr. Johnson came to town, about the year 1730, he had a design of engaging in some translation from the French.
<PB N="82" REF="97"/>
Whether he ever did or no, I cannot say; but, from this and some other specimens of his acquaintance with that lan∣guage, I cannot help thinking the author would have been extremely unlucky that had fallen into his hands.</P>

</SP></Q>
<P>On this passage Dr. Johnson hath the following note.</P>
<P><Q><HI>The night of dew, that on my cheeks down flows.</HI>] I cannot think the <HI>night of dew</HI> the true reading, but know not what to offer.</Q></P>
<P>That is very strange! Dr. Johnson.—Why, thou must have no more invention in thee than there is in a leaden plummet: thy pegasus must be confined and hoodwinked like a horse in a mill; or surely something would have sug∣gested itself to a writer who declares, that
<Q>not a single pas∣sage, in this whole work, has appeared to him corrupt, which he has not attempted to restore!</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Johnson's Preface.</NOTE>—I would be far from seeking to depreciate the success of our editor's <HI>modest industry</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Johnson's Preface.</NOTE>: but I am afraid the purchasers of his book will be apt to think, from many such slovenly notes as this, that both his <HI>industry</HI> and <HI>modesty</HI> are pretty well matched. It is evident, from the context, that the king, being over head and ears in love, employs himself, as people usually do in that situation,
<Q><L>Wasting the live-long hours away,</L>
<L>In tears by night, and sighs by day.</L></Q>
What objection then could our editor have to substituting <HI>nightly dew,</HI> instead of <HI>night of dew.</HI> If we are not absolutely certain the poet wrote so, there is a moral presumption, a
<PB N="83" REF="98"/>
great probability, of it: but whether he did or not, the al∣teration is certainly an amendment, and a very harmless one. It would also have served a little to save the credit of the editor; who, whatever might be his intentions before he be∣gun his work, sufficiently shews, by the work itself, that he regarded not what he had promised when he did it; and, by his Preface, that he knew as little what he <HI>had done</HI> when it was finished.</P>

<L>O me, with what strict patience have I sat</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>Here, indeed! we see our editor <HI>attempting</HI> to restore a pas∣sage, which appears to him corrupt.—Mark the success!—</P>
<P><Q><HI>To see a king transformed to a knot!] Knot</HI> has no sense that can suit this place. We may read <HI>sot.</HI> The rhymes in this play are such as that <HI>sat</HI> and <HI>sot</HI> may be well enough admitted.</Q></P>
<P>What! have you lost your <HI>hearing</HI> and <HI>judgment</HI> too, Mr. Editor, as well as your <HI>memory</HI> and <HI>invention?</HI>—Do you not know that even <HI>sot</HI> and <HI>sot</HI> cannot be admitted into any verse as English rhymes; and do you think the matter mended with <HI>sot</HI> and <HI>sat?</HI></P>
<P>Besides, do you see no impropriety in Biron's calling the King, to his face, a blockhood or fool, because truly he was in love; especially when he is conscious he is himself in the same situation? Add to this, that so gross an expression is to∣tally inconsistent with the fine strain of raillery that runs through the whole of his speech. This attempt, therefore, of our editor at <HI>restoration,</HI> is evidently a very unlucky one, and is excusable only as the unsucessful endeavour of <HI>modest industry.</HI></P>
<P>But why doth Dr. Johnson conclude this passage to be cor∣rupted? If he thinks the rhymes <HI>sot</HI> and <HI>sat</HI> admissible, surely he can have no objection to our pronouncing <HI>sat</HI> after the broad orthoëpy of the vulgar; in which case it would be a much less exceptionable rhyme to <HI>knot</HI> than what he is willing
<PB N="84" REF="99"/>
to admit.—But he says,
<Q><HI>knot</HI> hath no sense that can suit this place.</Q>
He might have found, however, by turning to almost any dictionary, excepting his own, that a <HI>knot</HI> is a small bird, well known in many parts of England, and is called <HI>avis Canuti</HI> by the naturalists; as it is said, because king Canutus was very fond of such birds. It is, indeed, a delicious kind of water-fowl. Now, as Biron hath said but just before, speaking of the King,
<Q>Shot, by heav'n! proceed, sweet Cupid; thou hast thumpt him with thy <HI>bird-bolt</HI> under the left pap;</Q>
I cannot, for my part, see any objection to his comparing him in this passage to a wounded <HI>knot.</HI> If my readers do, I have done. They will do me the justice, however, to own, that, if I am not possessed of Dr. Johnson's <HI>ingenuity</HI> and <HI>modesty,</HI> I shew at least as much <HI>industry</HI> in defending the text of Shake∣speare, as he does in pulling it to pieces.</P>

<P>Undoubtedly it is: and I have here only to ask Dr. John∣son, why he excludes the notes of Theobald, when they have been sufficiently exploded by other writers; and yet pesters his readers with those of Dr. Warburton, which stand exactly in the same predicament?</P>
<P>The ingenious author of the Canons of Criticism objected, long ago, to this proposed emendation of Dr. Warburton's;

judiciously observing, that if <HI>bedight</HI> means <HI>bedecked</HI> or <HI>adorned,</HI> the meadows being <HI>bedight</HI> already, they little need painting.—But Dr. Johnson seems to be so much influenced by the <HI>respect due to high place,</HI> that he seems determined to avoid the name of Edwards, as much as possible, for fear of of∣fending the bishop.</P>

<L>I'th' name of me—</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>I believe <HI>me</HI> should be blotted out.</P></Q>
<P>Here we have another article of Dr. Johnson's critical creed. It is certain that, whether <HI>me</HI> be in or out, is, in this place, of very little consequence; but I so much revere the text of Shakespeare, that, without I see an absolute necessity for it, I will never defile it with a blot. It seems as if the very name of <HI>Johnson</HI> was fated to cast invidious reflections on that of <HI>Shakespeare</HI>; as if it was malignantly formed to absorb tho rays diffused by superior lustre, and enviously to fully, with a reflected gloom, the fountain of its own light.—This scheme of blotting-out was originally suggested by a <HI>Johnson</HI>; who,
<PB N="86" REF="101"/>
when the players made their boast, in honour of Shakespeare, that he never blotted out a line, replied,
<Q>Would he had blotted out a thousand.</Q>
This was BEN <HI>Johnson,</HI> who only expressed his wish that Shakespeare had done, what SAM <HI>Johnson</HI> boldly determined to do for him. For it is to be ob∣served, that here was no <HI>tenderness due to living reputation</HI> to stop his hand; and he might think to indulge himself SAFELY in the <HI>innocent discussion of a dead poet's pretensions to re∣nown</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Johnson's Preface.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If it be not owing to some such antipathy or inviduous in∣fluence subsisting between the names of Johnson and Shake∣speare, to what else can we impute Dr. Johnson's objection to the harmless <HI>me</HI> in the above passage! He very possibly cannot find any use for it. But if we consider that the whole line is a mere exclamation; testifying the clown's surprize at hearing Autolicus cry out, and seeing him lie groveling on the earth. Had he said <HI>In the name of</HI> HEAVEN—or, <HI>In the name of</HI> MERCY—the line, however bordering on profa∣nity, would have past: but nothing is more common than for conscientious people to check themselves in the middle of such exclamations, or to substitute some innocent word in the place of the exceptionable one. Again, if any objection be made to the supposition of the Clown's stopping in the middle of the word <HI>mercy</HI>; let us take another view of the exclama∣tion, and admit the word <HI>me</HI> to stand as a personal pronoun. It is notorious that persons, who, as Hotspur says,
<Q>swear like comfit-maker's wives, and give such sarcenet security for their oaths, as, <HI>in good sooth—as true as I live—as God shall mend me</HI>—and <HI>as sure as I live.</HI></Q>
I say it is very common for these uncommon swearers, who cannot gulp down or digest a <HI>good mouth-filling oath,</HI> to protest <HI>upon their</HI> WORD. Now I cannot see why a person, who, to avoid a profane oath, should protest <HI>upon his</HI> WORD, might not, with
<PB N="87" REF="102"/>
equal propriety, in order to avoid a profane exclamation, cry out <HI>in his</HI> NAME. Admitting this, the Clown, instead of crying out in the name of heav'n, exclaimed in the name of himself; viz. <HI>l' th'</HI> NAME <HI>of me.</HI>—And this expression may surely pass among expletives of this kind, as well as <HI>for the</HI> SOUL <HI>of me—for the</HI> LIFE <HI>of me—for the</HI> HEART <HI>of me,</HI> &amp;c.—After all, whether I have convinced the reader or not, of the propriety of letting <HI>me</HI> stand in the text, I must have some better reason given ME for expunging it, than the <HI>ipse-credidit</HI> of a JOHNSON.</P>

<L>—even now I tremble</L>
<L>To think your father, by some accident,</L>

<L>How would he look, to see his work, so noble,</L>
<L>Vilely bound up!</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Here Dr. Johnson hath found Shakespeare tripping again.—Hear what he says.</P>
<P><Q><HI>His work so noble, &amp;c.</HI>] It is impossible for any man to rid his mind of his profession. The authorship of Shakespeare has supplied him with a metaphor, which, rather than he would lose it, he has put, with no great propriety, into the mouth of a country maid. Thinking of his own works, his mind passed naturally to the binder. I am glad he has no hint at an editor.</Q></P>
<P>We have here also, another aukward attempt of our editor at wit and pleasantry. But, why wilt thou, Dr. Johnson, persist thus in playing at bob-cherry, when the prize hangeth so high above thine head, and such a weight of lead is in∣cumbent on thy heels? I have already advised thee, in the fullness of my heart, and, as Cicero says, non otii abun∣dantiâ, sed amoris erga te, not to be so forward to display thy wit. I told thee before, and I tell thee again, thou hast it not in thee, being as unable to divert the reader with thy pleasantry, as to convince him of Shakespeare's impropriety.—Again, why, Dr. Johnson, art thou glad that Shakespeare
<PB N="88" REF="103"/>
hath no hint at an editor? Dost thou think he would have thrown out any censures that might reach <HI>thee?</HI>—No—that incomparable bard was, as thou sayest, the poet of nature, and drew his characters from, the life: and nature had not produced in that age so arrogant, and at the same time so dull an animal, as the present commentator on Shakespeare. There were pedants and pedagogues, it is true, in his day; he has depicted an Holofernes and a Sir Hugh Evans. But these were slight excrescences, mushrooms, champignons, that pe∣rished as the smoke of the dunghil evaporated, which reared them. A modern editor of Shakespeare is, on the contrary, a fungus attached to an oak; a male agaric of the most as∣tringent kind, that, while it disfigures its form, may last for ages to disgrace the parent of its being.</P>
<P>But, to lay aside metaphor; not Burgerdischius, Gronovius, nor any one of the whole tribe of Dutch commentators, from the first of them to the last, hath proceeded through his au∣thor with more phlegm and frigidity, than Dr. Johnson hath gone through Shakespeare <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>And here lies the difference between Dr. Warburton and Dr. Johnson, whose commentaries I place both on a footing with re∣gard to their utility, as they are themselves pretty equal with respect to that arrogance with which they have treated the public, the liv∣ing patrons of Shakespeare. In the commentary of Dr. Warburton, however, we have all the fire and spirit of a restif imagination, bridled in by as perverse an understanding: whereas, in that of Dr. Johnson, we see but too plainly the waywardness of senescence struggling with the weakness of puerility.</P>
<P>It may be thought strange that I should treat Dr. Johnson's pre∣tensions to wit so contemptuously, when it is notorious that his bons-mots have been constantly repeated for these ten years past in taverns and in coffeehouses, at dinners, and over tea-tables, to the great gratification of his admirers, and the edification of their hear∣ers. Nay, it is well known, that a certain literary projector, ex∣cited by the success of BEN <HI>Johnson's</HI> jests, had schemed the publi∣cation of the <HI>Johnsoniana,</HI> under the name of our editor, intending to insert on his title page, instead of <HI>O rare</HI> BEN! <HI>O brave</HI> SAM!—But I know not how, yet so it happened, that, upon enquiry, the projector could not muster up above a dozen <HI>genuine</HI> jokes worth printing. It was found that most of the wise sayings, smart repar∣tees,
<PB N="89" REF="104"/>pregnant puns, and cramp conundrums, imputed to him, had been forged or invented for him by his friends and acquaintance. The few following indeed were, if I remember right, admitted to be genuine:</P>
<P>JOHNSONIANA, <HI>or the witty sayings of Sam. Johnson, M. A.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Johnson, being sent for, by order of the king, to write the History of the House of Brunswick; replied, with great humour and loyalty, to the gentleman who proposed it, by saying, <HI>What! Sir, is there no scoundrel author in England but myself?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Johnson, being offered a pension by his present majesty, in return for the above instance of his loyalty, he, notwithstanding his former railing at placemen and pensioners, very wittily and wisely said—<HI>nothing</HI>; but growled and TOOK IT.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson having, on a necessary occasion, turned himself to∣ward the wall, in one of the streets of Oxford, was reminded by his companion, that he had indecently placed himself just opposite a window where some young ladies were drinking tea: on which Mr. Johnson, p—f—g on, wittily and delicately replied, <HI>Sir, it is the</HI> OFFICE <HI>of Nature, and I shall</HI> DISCHARGE <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>At another time, Mr. Johnson, being in company where some persons were disputing about the doctrine of the Trinity, he rose up from his chair, and <HI>ingeniously</HI> decided the dispute at once, by clenching his fist, and threatening to <HI>knock the first person down, who, in his presence, should cast infidel reflections on his friend Athanasius.</HI></P>
<P>In the same company, he was also heard most divertingly to af∣firm, that <HI>The man must be an</HI> ATHEIST <HI>of the deepest dye, who did not believe in the</HI> COCK-LANE GHOST.</P>
<P>At various times and places, he hath been heard also to drop the following exquisite strokes of wit and humour.—<HI>Sir, Sir, the fellow is a fool.—Sir, the man is a blockhead.—The rascal is an Atheist.—There are but three good lines in all</HI> CHURCHILL's <HI>satires, and two of them he stole from my</HI> LONDON.—<HI>Shakespeare a poet! Sir, he never wrote a line of poetry in his life. An ostler! Sir, a</HI> VARLET, <HI>that used to hold gentlemen's horses at the play-house!</HI></P>
<P>These, and a few other strokes, equally pointed and humorous, being all the undertaker of the above project could pick up; and as the humour even of these depended greatly on a certain motion of the head peculiar to Dr. Johnson, which cannot be committed to paper, it was judged adviseable to drop the scheme: so that I hope I stand excused, if I do not place Dr. Johnson's witticisms among the <HI>anas,</HI> or think him upon a sooting even with Joe Miller, or his own name-sake Ben.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="103"/></NOTE>. It is hard to say, indeed, who
<PB N="89" REF="104"/>
is the dullest scholiast of the dullest writer of antiquity. But Dr. Johnson has the singular honour of being the dullest an∣notator
<PB N="90" REF="105"/>
on the brightest of all those who have succeeded the revival of letters.</P>
<P>To return to Dr. Johnson's annotation, and the more par∣ticular defence of Shakespeare's text.</P>
<P>The editor hath here charged the poet with being guilty of an impropriety in making a country maid talk like an author. But how doth Dr. Johnson know that this is really the case? How doth it appear, from the words of the text, that the al∣lusion he charges on Shakespeare is at all intended?—That Perdita could know nothing about book-binding, is taken for granted; this being the very circumstance, on which the charge of impropriety is founded. But it does not appear, notwithstanding Dr. Johnson imputes this impropriety to Shakespeare's profession, that the poet himself was much versed in the matter. It is very little likely that a writer, who confessedly took so little care about the <HI>printing</HI> of his works, and has <HI>no hint at an editor,</HI> should yet have his head so full of a <HI>book-binder.</HI> Dr. Johnson is pleased, for the honour I suppose of our profession, to rank Shakespeare among the livery-men of our company. But, though I honour my pro∣fession as being the most liberal of all others, though I honour the immortal memory of Shakespeare still more, yet I respect the <HI>truth</HI> most of all. It does not appear that the term <HI>au∣thorship</HI> can be applied with any propriety to Shakespeare; for, though he wrote for the stage, I find no good authority for supposing he sold his copies, or transferred his right in them, to booksellers; and he only is an author by <HI>profession</HI> who writes for the TRADE.—No—To the honour of the gentlemen of the stage, Shakespeare was by <HI>profession</HI> a PLAYER; and I have no better reason, than his knowing every thing, to suppose he knew that a book-binder existed.</P>
<P>To come now to <HI>verbal</HI> criticism. A piece of <HI>work vilely bound up,</HI> must, according to Dr. Johnson, necessarily mean a <HI>book meanly bound.</HI> But why so? Neither the words <HI>work</HI> nor <HI>bound up</HI> are idiomatical, when applied to book-binding.
<PB N="91" REF="106"/>
In the first place, we do not call the writings of an author his <HI>work,</HI> but his <HI>works.</HI> And, though sometimes, in speak∣ing of the several sheets of a book, or the different volumes of an author's works, we may talk of <HI>binding</HI> them <HI>up</HI>; yet, speaking of a <HI>book</HI> in the singular number, we talk always of its being <HI>bound</HI> merely; not of its being <HI>bound up.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, the term <HI>bind up</HI> is applicable to various works of husbandry, and such kinds of employment as a country maid might well be supposed acquainted with. Add to this, that the term <HI>bound up</HI> has a peculiar propriety in the passage before us, as it is opposed to <HI>prank'd up,</HI> a few lines above. The reader will remember, that Perdita, the country maid, is dressed like a princess; or, as she says, <HI>most goddess∣like prank'd up</HI>; and Florizel, the real prince, is disguised in the habit of a clown. Now it is observable that, as the su∣perb dresses of the rich and gay were fastened together by or∣namental brooches, ouches, knots of ribbons, &amp;c. so the coarser garments of the poor and simple were fastened toge∣ther, and tied with strings or leathern thongs. And hence Perdita might very properly say, that the prince, in his <HI>swain's wearing,</HI> was vilely <HI>bound up</HI>; without having any more allu∣sion to the <HI>binding</HI> of a book than to the <HI>binding up</HI> of a wheat∣sheaf. But, because she has called the son the father's <HI>work,</HI> without any impropriety in the line before, she must in this truly allude to <HI>book-binding:</HI> though, were it so, she must be guilty of as great an impropriety in the application of her allusion. For why an author should be so terribly angry, as she supposes, at accidentally seeing his works meanly bound, I cannot possibly devise; as I conceive neither his interest nor his reputation can be at all affected by the difference between calve's skin and sheep's leather.</P>

<P>On this passage our editor gives the following laconic note:</P>
<P><Q>* What he means by his <HI>pedler's excrement</HI> I know not?</Q> No!—Then, give me leave to tell you, Dr. Johnson, you know too little, or are much too indolent and inattentive to undertake a commentary on Shakespeare.—Doth not <HI>Armado,</HI> in <HI>Love's Labour Lost,</HI> page 185, of this very volume, call his <HI>beard</HI> an <HI>excrement?</HI> and do not you tell us in a note on that passage, that 'the author has before called the <HI>beard</HI> va∣leur's <HI>excrement</HI> in the Merchant of Venice?' And should not the recollection of these passages (not to mention others which an able commentator might have recollected) have excited you to turn over this play a little, in order to see whether some reason might not be found for supposing the word <HI>ex∣crement</HI> to have here the same meaning?—You may think, indeed, the futility of such a research evident on the face of the text; as a man cannot easily put his <HI>beard</HI> in his <HI>pocket.</HI>—Very true; but he does not call it his <HI>own</HI> beard, but his <HI>pedler's</HI> beard, for that character was assumed, as was also the false beard he wore on that occasion, in order the more to disguise himself, lest he should be known again by the clown he had just before robbed, act IV. scene 3. It would have required no very acute or profound observation also, to have remarked that, though Florizel, in scene 10. stripped him of his pedler's clothes, he had either no occasion for his beard, or did not think it a false one: this, therefore, Autolycus had still on, notwithstanding his change of habit, till he found it necessary to speak to the clowns; when, prudently to appear in character, he whip'd it off, and clap'd it in his pocket; saying, <HI>Let me pocket up my pedler's excrement.</HI>—Do you know <HI>now,</HI> Dr. Johnson?

<Q>Ped∣ler's excrement is pedler's beard.</Q>
But, as he has not any where thought proper to let the reader into the secret of its being a fictitious beard, or how otherwise Autolicus could put it in his pocket, I conceived some of my readers might profit by the above illustra∣tion, and therefore determined to insert it: and this the rather, when I reflected that Dr. Johnson could by no means lay a just claim to the merit of such information as he might acquire, by pub∣lickly advertising for, after his book was finished.</NOTE>!'</P>

It may possibly mean a hand with no money in it; or, according to the rules of <HI>physiog∣nomy,</HI> she may intend to insinuate, that it is not a lover's hand, a moist hand being vulgarly accounted a sign of an amorous constitution.</P></Q>
<P>It must be confessed, indeed, that our editor's sagacity is frequently at fault when a jest is in the wind. The bringing <HI>the hand to the buttery-bar, and letting it drink,</HI> is a proverbial phrase among forward Abigails, to ask at once for a kiss and a present. Sir Andrew's slowness of comprehension in this particular, gave her a just suspicion, at once, of his frigidity and avarice.—She therefore calls his hand dry: the moistness of the hand being a sign of liberality, as well in matters of love as money. Thus Othello to Desdemona,
<Q><L>Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.</L>
<L>—</L>
<L>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.</L>

</SP></Q>
Old Foresight, in Love for Love, describes his wife also as hav∣ing a mole upon her lip, with a <HI>moist palm,</HI> and an open li∣berality on the mount of Venus.—Dr. Johnson need not, therefore, have expressed so much caution of suspecting this to be the truth of the matter. There is one thing, how∣ever, he should have attended to; and this is, that the whole of this insinuation is founded rather on the rules of <HI>palmistry</HI> than <HI>physiognomy:</HI> for, though the etymology of the latter word be known to the learned, who may admit of such lati∣tude of expression, I do not remember ever to have seen <HI>phy∣siognomy</HI> made use of before by an English writer to signify any information of this kind, but that which is acquired from the features of the face. So that Marian's finding out any thing from St. Andrew's <HI>palm,</HI> by the rules of <HI>physiognomy,</HI> must appear to an unlearned reader, as absurd as if she had read his folly in his <HI>phyz</HI> by the rules of <HI>palmistry.</HI></P>
<P>To check the smile, however, of the unlearned reader, and to preserve the <HI>veneration</HI> due to cramp words and crooked letters, he is to know that <HI>phyz</HI> doth not come from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> but from a less ancient and honourable stock, the French <HI>vi∣sage,</HI> or the Italian <HI>viso.</HI></P>

I have ever looked upon it, however, as so vile a blot in this ad∣mirable piece of raillery of Sir Toby's, that I cannot help imputing it to the interpolation of some transcriber, who ima∣gined there was an excellent joke in <HI>making water into a</HI> SINK-A-PACE. The conceit, however, is so low and vile, that I cannot give into the notion that Shakespeare, fond as he seems of punning and playing upon words, was the author of it. I am confirmed in this opinion also by reflecting, that the attention of the reader is diverted from the real humour of the passage, by this horrid conundrum. Sir Toby, in car∣rying his ridicule of poor Ague-cheek's dancing-accomplish∣ments to the highest pitch, proceeds so far as to tell him, he would not stand still on the most necessary occasion, even to make water; but that he might not betray himself, even to this fool, by talking of absolute impossibilities, he fixes on a grave, flow, and even hobbling kind of dance, the <HI>cinque∣pace,</HI> for this suspicious occasion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The gravity and interruptions of this dance are, indeed, par∣ticularly pointed out by Shakespeare on another occasion.

<P>Dr. Warburton hath a note on this passage, which our editor hath inserted without any animadversion, notwithstanding it hath been sufficiently exposed and confuted by Mr. Ed∣wards, as Dr. Johnson appears to think by the pointing he hath adopted in the text, which is different both from that of Warburton and Theobald. Theobald points and reads thus,
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR TOBY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a gentleman. Here—
<STAGE>[belches]</STAGE>
A plague o'these pickle herring!</P>
</SP></Q>
Dr. Warburton's note runs thus.</P>
<P><Q><HI>'Tis a gentleman.</HI> HERE—] He had before said it was a gentleman. He was asked what gentleman? and he makes this reply; which, it is plain, is corrupt, and should be read thus,
<Q>'Tis a gentleman-HEIR;</Q>
i. e. some lady's eldest son just come out of the nursery; for this was the appearance Viola made in men's cloaths.</Q></P>
<P>On this note Mr. Edwards observes, that <HI>gentleman-heir</HI> is a new and unnecessary phrase for a lady's eldest son: con∣cluding that
<Q>Shakespeare hath no need of it; as any body will own, who considers that Sir Toby was drunk, and in∣terrupted in his speech by his pickled herrings.</Q>
That is, by the pickled herrings he had been eating; and which, ri∣sing in his stomach, occasioned him to belch, as Theobald has it.</P>
<P>Is it possible, after all this, to guess what induced our edi∣tor to trouble his readers with Dr. Warburton's frivolous note, and to adopt Mr. Edwards's pointing, against that of Theo∣bald, without mentioning a word of either of the two latter?</P>

<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Will you go an-heirs?</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton's note on this passage, printed without any animadversion of our editor, runs thus;</P>
<P><Q><HI>Will you go</HI> AN HEIRS?] This nonsense is spoken to Shal∣low. We should read, <HI>Will you go</HI> ON, HERIS? <HI>i. e.</HI> Will you go on, Master? <HI>Heris,</HI> an old Scotch word for ma∣ster.</Q></P>
<P>What the present editor understands by this word, or whether he understands any thing by it, is not easily deter∣mined, as he hath thought proper to leave it in this situation, doubtless for the reason given above; viz. its being natural for the reader to delight more in what he may find out of himself, than what the scholiast may tell him. For my part, however, I apprehend the mere English reader would be glad of some little assistance here, especially as Dr. Johnson does not seem to be satisfied with Dr. Warburton's note.—The author of the Revisal appears also to be of the same opinion,
<PB N="100" REF="115"/>
and therefore hath given his readers the following remarks on this controverted passage.
<Q><HI>Will you go on, Heris?</HI> The nonsense of the former editions was, 'Will you go <HI>an heirs?</HI>' Mr. Warburton assures us, '<HI>heris</HI> is an old Scotch word for master.' It may be so for ought I know. But as my ex∣perience hath taught me some distrust of this gentleman's positive assertions in matters of this nature, I must beg leave to doubt of it. Besides, this word, according to this in∣terpetation of it, is of the singular number, and yet is ad∣dressed, not to Ford, but to Page and Shallow, as is evi∣dent from what immediately follows. I see no reason neither why either Shakespeare, or mine host of the Garter, should chuse to talk old Scotch, and therefore I should rather sup∣pose our poet might have written, 'Will you go on, <HI>hearts?</HI>' An expression suited to the jovial character of mine host, and not very different in appearance from the common reading, especially when spelled as it anciently was, <HI>herts.</HI> Mr. Theobald's conjectures, 'Will you go on <HI>here?</HI>' or Will you go, <HI>mynheirs?</HI>' carry with them, in my opinion, very little probability.</Q></P>
<P>It is very justly observed by the Reviser, that there is no ob∣vious reason for mine host of the Garter to speak old Scotch; but if we consider that he is a German, I do not see why the scholiast should suppose Theobald's last emendation impro∣bable. Nothing is more likely, I think, than for him now and then to drop a word of high or low Dutch. It is true that the word <HI>mynheirs</HI> is properly neither one nor the other: for neither the Dutch nor the German make the plural of <HI>heer</HI> or <HI>herr</HI> end in <HI>s.</HI> Add to this, that they seldom use the personal pronoun singular with the noun plural. When they accost a single person with the title of <HI>my Lord</HI> or <HI>Sir,</HI> it is <HI>Mynheer</HI> or <HI>Mein herr</HI>; but when they address more than one with the title of <HI>Lords</HI> or <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the pronoun is generally dropped, and they say <HI>Heeren</HI> or <HI>Herren.</HI></P>
<P>But I see no manner of impropriety in supposing our host to be either above or below such idiomatical and grammatical
<PB N="101" REF="116"/>
niceties: in which case he might not only join the singular pronoun with the plural noun (as the English say my Lords, as well as my Lord) but also give the plural noun their common ending in English; so that if Theobald had substituted <HI>myn∣heers,</HI> it might have pasted. But if it be insisted on, that our host of the Garter shall speak properly and elegantly, the pas∣sage must stand thus. "Will you go on, <HI>heeren,</HI> or <HI>herren.</HI>" The reader may take which he likes best, both meaning sim∣ply, <HI>Will you go on, gentlemen?</HI>—</P>
<P>I cannot help referring, on this occasion, to a passage in our editor's preface; where, among other excuses for doing so little, after having promised so much, he hath the follow∣ing curious passage:</P>
<P><Q>If my readings are of little value, they have not been ostentatiously displayed, or importunately obtruded. I could have written longer notes; for the art of writing notes is not of difficult attainment. The work is performed, first by railing at the stupidity, negligence, ignorance, and asi∣nine tastelessness of the former editors, and shewing, from all that goes before, and all that follows, the inelegance and absurdity of the old reading; then by proposing some∣thing, which, to superficial readers, would seem specious, but which the editor rejects with indignation; then by <HI>pro∣ducing the true reading,</HI> with a long paraphrase, and con∣cluding with <HI>loud</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Johnson is here expresly describing the method of <HI>writing</HI> annotations.

<P>We see here that Dr. Johnson knew very well what was to be done, if he had but had abilities, industry, or good∣will

will enough to do it. Indeed, he hath sometimes succeeded pretty well in doing all that he hath here described, except in one little particular, and that is <HI>producing the true reading</HI>; this he hath done so very seldom, that we could very readily have excused him, if he had displayed even more ostentation, had he given us but a proportionate quantity more of <HI>truth.</HI></P>

<P>Tho' Page be a secure fool, and stand so firmly on his wife's fealty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>All the copies, says Dr. Warburton, read <HI>stand so firmly on his wife's</HI> FRAILTY: but to this reading, Mr. Theobald ob∣jected.
<Q>No, surely; <HI>Page</HI> stood tightly to the opinion of her honesty, and would not entertain a thought of her be∣ing <HI>frail.</HI> I have therefore ventured to substitute a word correspondent to the sense required, and one which our poet frequently uses to signify conjugal fidelity.</Q>
—In reply to this note, Dr. Warburton says,
<Q>Mr. Theobald has no conception how any man could stand firmly on his wife's <HI>frailty.</HI> And why? Because he had no conception how he could stand upon it, without knowing what it was. But if I tell a stranger that the bridge he is about to cross is rotten, and he believes it not, but will go on, may I not say, when I see him upon it, that he stands firmly on a rotten plank? yet he has changed <HI>frailty</HI> for <HI>fealty,</HI> and the Oxford editor has followed him. But they took the phrase, <HI>to stand firmly on,</HI> to signify <HI>to insist</HI> upon; whereas it signifies to <HI>rest upon</HI>; which the character of a <HI>secure fool,</HI> given to him, shews. So that the common reading has an elegance that would be lost in the alteration.</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding this fine reasoning, however, of Dr. War∣burton, the present editor hath judiciously stuck by Theobald's emendation in the text, though he is perfectly silent about it in his notes. It happens, nevertheless, very unluckily for Dr. Johnson, that he hath quoted this very passage in his

</SP></Q>
<P>In a note on this passage, our editor hath displayed his critical acumen most egregiously; as indeed most of Shakespeare's editors do, when they venture an inch beyond the servile bounds of <HI>verbal</HI> criticism. Our poet is universally allowed to be one of the greatest masters in describing the effects, as well as the greatest judge of the operation, of the passions, that ever existed. And yet is he here arraigned for an error, which affects him as an accurate observer of human nature, and a
<PB N="104" REF="119"/>
just delineator of the actions of mankind, his most distin∣guishing characteristics. The note here follows:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Eleven o'clock.</HI>] Ford should rather have said <HI>ten o'clock</HI>; the time was between ten and eleven; and his impatient suspicion was not likely to stay beyond the time.</Q></P>
<P>No; Dr. Johnson.—<HI>Ford</HI> should neither be made to say <HI>ten</HI> nor <HI>eleven</HI> o'clock: he is not speaking of the time, at which Falstaff is to meet his wife; but of the time then present, which is <HI>seven</HI> o'clock, just <HI>three hours,</HI> as he expresly observes, from the earliest time of the appointment. So that, so far is his impatient suspicion from staying beyond the time of their intended meeting, that it seems to urge him instantly to go about to defeat the supposed purposes of it.—<HI>I will about it—better</HI> THREE HOURS <HI>too soon than a minute too late.</HI>—Why should he particularly mention <HI>three</HI> hours rather than any in∣definite time, unless for the reason given? I know not how far the copies may authorize this reading; but the mistake might easily be made by the first transcribers, and be succes∣sively transmitted through the press uncorrected, as the sense was not very palpably affected by it. By reading <HI>seven</HI> for <HI>eleven,</HI> however, we deliver Shakespeare from the persecution of his annotator, and give a beauty and propriety to the pas∣sage, which at present is doubtless exceptionable. I would advise the actor also, who may perform this part for the fu∣ture, to look at his watch, when he repeats this sentence; for that was evidently the author's intention, as appears by the intimation of his having still <HI>three hours good,</HI> in which to take proper measures to surprise the parties. He did not mean, as is plain by the sequel, to prevent or hinder their meeting, but to be before-hand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The word <HI>prevent</HI> being here used, perhaps nearly, though not altogether in the same sense <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in our liturgy: when we say, <HI>O Lord prevent us in all our doings.</HI> It may indeed be conceived to carry a double meaning; viz. Ford's simply getting the start of the parties, in order to detect and expose them; or, as is above hinted, to prevent or hinder his being made a cuckold. But I think he
<PB N="105" REF="120"/>seems to so be well assured of his having been cuckolded by somebody or other, that a single prevention of this kind could be of little consideration with him. It were indeed to little purpose, if his opi∣nion of his wife were justly founded, and his sarcasm on the sex in general were true; i. e. that
<Q>what they think in their hearts they <HI>may</HI> effect, they will break their hearts but they <HI>will</HI> effect.</Q></P>
<PB N="104" REF="119"/></NOTE> with them in the means of
<PB N="105" REF="120"/>
detection. Add to all this, that although, in his rage, he says, just before, <HI>the hour is fixt,</HI> yet no one <HI>particular hour</HI> was precisely named for the intended rendezvous; it was not at ten, nor at eleven, but between ten and eleven; so that the reason Dr. Johnson gives, why he should not say <HI>eleven,</HI> is in itself sufficient to prove he should say neither.</P>

<P>It was an ancient custom among the literati all over Eu∣rope, and is still kept up abroad, particularly in Holland and Germany, for men of letters to keep a book, which they call an <HI>album,</HI> so denominated from a similar application of that word, among the ancient Romans, to a matricular register or muster-roll of names. This book, or books, contained in like manner a list of the names of the owner's friends, ad∣mirers or acquaintance; who, in subscribing their names in
<PB N="109" REF="124"/>
his <HI>album,</HI> generally used to preface them with some compli∣ment or device, in prose or verse, each after his own man∣ner. It was very natural, therefore, for them to say, in speak∣ing of their favourites or friends, that they were in their books; and of their enemies, that they were not in their books, or out of their books. Nay, I know not if it would be at all unna∣tural for resentful persons to strike out the names of those who might afterwards offend them, in order to shew their spleen, and at the same time that they would not be obliged to such people for a compliment. I cannot help thinking also, that I discover a propriety in the messenger's using this phrase to Beatrice, as he might intend sarcastically to insinu∣ate that, he imagined, by the severity of her raillery against Benedict, that he was one who had paid no compliment to her beauty. But whether this propriety be imaginary or not, there is not the least room for supposing that he meant to say Beatrice had not, according to Dr. Johnson's explication, re∣membered Benedict in the codicil of her will. It is, indeed, a thousand to one if the last will and testament of the buxom Beatrice was written; and a much greater chance if it had co∣dicils annexed to it.</P>

<P>Dr. Johnson's note.
<Q>What is it <HI>to go to the world?</HI> per∣haps to enter, by marriage, into a settled state: but why is the unmarried lady <HI>sun-burnt?</HI> I believe we should read, <HI>thus goes every one to the</HI> wood <HI>but I, and I am sun-burnt.</HI> Thus does every one but I find a shelter, and I am left ex∣posed to wind and <HI>sun. The nearest way to the wood,</HI> is a phrase for the readiest means to any end. It is said of a a woman, who accepts a worse match than those which she had refused, that she has passed through the <HI>wood,</HI> and at last taken a crooked stick. But conjectural criticism has al∣ways
<PB N="110" REF="125"/>
something to abate its confidence. Shakespeare, in All's well that ends well, uses the phrase, <HI>to go to the world,</HI> for <HI>marriage.</HI> So that my emendation depends only on the opposition of <HI>wood</HI> to <HI>sun-burnt.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A very slight dependance, indeed, and by no means worthy so prolix an illustration! Our editor, surely, had lost him∣self in a wood, or his wits were gone wool-gathering about the hedges while he penned it.—<HI>To go to the world,</HI> is to <HI>go into,</HI> to <HI>settle in, the world,</HI> which is usually supposed to be done in marriage. Thus the clown, in All's well that ends well, asks the Countess leave to marry Isabel.—<HI>If I have your ladyship's good will to go to the</HI> world, <HI>Isabel the woman and I will do as we may.</HI>—That a <HI>wood</HI> was necessary to give meaning to the word <HI>sun-burnt,</HI> I cannot admit. It is evident that Beatrice here speaks ironically, and, perhaps, a little sarcastically and peerishly, on the occasion of Hero's getting a husband before her. For it seems that Hero was a brunette, and, in all probability, not so fair nor so fine a woman as Beatrice. At least so it is, if we may take Signior Benedict's word for it, who, speaking of Hero, says,
<Q>She is too low for an high praise, too <HI>brown</HI> for a <HI>fair</HI> praise, and too little for a great praise:</Q>
whereas of her cousin Beatrice he speaks in a dif∣ferent manner, and this even before he is tricked into falling in love with her, and while he boasts that
<Q>he can see with∣out spectacles.</Q>
Of her he says, after turning up his nose, as it were, at the commendations given to the person of Hero,
<Q>There's her cousin, if she were not possessed with such a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December.</Q>
Now, though we should suppose Benedict to be a little partial, as having a sneaking kindness, though he will not own it, for this ami∣able fury; yet it seems clear that she was fairer than Hero. It was very natural for her, therefore, to say ironically on this occasion,
<Q>Thus every one gets married but I.—Poor I am <HI>sunburn'd</HI>; i. e. not fair enough to attract the notice of
<PB N="111" REF="126"/>
the men, but must sit in a corner and cry <HI>heigh-ho</HI> for a husband.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="113" REF="128"/>Dr. Warburton condemns the text here, and says it is cor∣rupted into <HI>nonsense</HI>; he then gives us, as usual, some worse nonsense of his own; and Dr. Johnson, as usual, inserts his annotation, confessing that he hath himself nothing, or very little better than nothing, to offer.—The former scholiast proceeds thus,
<Q><L>—<HI>good alone,</HI></L>
<L>Is good without a name. Vileness is so.</L></Q></P>
<P>The text is here
<Q>corrupted into nonsense. We should read,
<Q><L>—good alone</L>
<L>Is good; <HI>and, with</HI> a name, vileness is so.</L></Q>
<HI>i. e.</HI> good is good, though there be no addition of title; and vileness is vileness, though there be. The Oxford editor, understanding nothing of this, strikes out vileness, and puts in its place <HI>in'tself.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Dr. Johnson says,
<Q>The present reading is certainly wrong; and, to confess the truth, I do not think Dr. Warburton's emendation right; yet I have nothing that I can propose with much confidence. Of all the conjectures that I can make, that which least displeases me is this:
<Q><L>—virtue alone,</L>
<L>Is good without a name; <HI>Helen</HI> is so;</L></Q>
the rest follows easily by this change.</Q></P>
<P>The author of the Revisal seems to understand the passage better than either of the doctorial critics just mentioned. He tells us the common reading is,
<Q><L>—good alone</L>
<L>Is good <HI>without</HI> a name; vileness is so:</L></Q>
<Q>the meaning of which, says he, one would imagine should be pretty plain. Good singly by itself, without the addi∣tion of title, is good still; it is the same thing with vile∣ness. It takes its nature from itself, and not from exter∣nal circumstances, as title and the like. And this inter∣pretation
<PB N="114" REF="129"/>
is given by the poet himself, in the lines imme∣diately following,
<Q><L>The property by what it is should go,</L>
<L>Not by the title.</L></Q>
Notwithstanding all this, Mr. Warburton mistook the meaning, and then murdered the text.</Q></P>
<P>As to Dr. Johnson's conjectural emendation, it serves to no other purpose than to betray how barren he is at conjectures. I conceive, nevertheless, that our editor hath restored the true pointing, though it differs from that of his rival scho∣liast. But whether this be due to cunning or good luck, I cannot pretend to say, unless I knew to whom to attribute the honour of correcting the press, the editor or the printer. The meaning I think is obvious, and the passage may be pa∣raphrased thus: <HI>good</HI> by itself <HI>is good, and even so, if unadorned by titles, vileness were vileness.</HI></P>
<P>I do not propose this improvement of the Reviser's expla∣nation with any great confidence, nor merely for the sake of differing from that very sensible writer; but because I think there is some little tautology in saying <HI>good by itself</HI> is good, and then to add <HI>without</HI> a name; for certainly if it was <HI>by it∣self,</HI> alone, it was <HI>without</HI> any thing else.</P>

But not to insist on Shakespeare's standing in no need of such suffrage, the allusion of <HI>darkness</HI> to the gloom of <HI>discontent</HI> would be unexceptionable, even in the meanest of our minor poets. The whole line, however, hath, in my opinion, only a ge∣neral allusion to the common saying of a <HI>smoky house and a scolding wife</HI>; which, with a little alteration, and still pre∣serving an alliteration, Bertram converted to use on the pre∣sent occasion.</P>

</LETTER>
</SP></Q>
<P>The commentators seem to be sadly puzzled to explain this letter; the meaning of which could not possibly be mis∣taken by any one who should read the play quite through. Dr. Warburton's note runs thus:</P>
<P><Q><HI>When thou canst get the ring upon my finger.</HI>] i. e. When thou canst get the ring, which is on my finger, into thy possession. The Oxford editor, who took it the other way, to signify, when thou canst get it on upon my finger, very sagaciously alters it to, <HI>When thou canst get the ring</HI> from <HI>my finger.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Dr. Warburton's explanation is undoubtedly as well founded as the Oxford editor's is strange and inconsistent. Dr. John∣son, indeed, says, that he thinks
<Q>Dr. Warburton's explana∣tion sufficient; but, continues he, I once read it thus, <HI>When thou canst get the ring upon</HI> THY <HI>finger, which never shall come</HI> off MINE.</Q></P>
<P>Will the reader believe me, when I tell him, after this, that the meaning of the passage in dispute is not only ascer∣tained
<PB N="116" REF="131"/>
by the plot of the play, as above hinted; but is also expressed in the last act by words that admit of no equivoca∣tion? Yet so it is; Helena, in the last scene, producing the letter, and addressing Bertram in these words,
<Q><L>—there is your ring,</L>
<L>And look you, here's your letter: this it says,</L>
<L>When from my finger you can get this ring,</L>
<L>And are by me with child, &amp;c. <HI>This is done.</HI></L>
<L>Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?</L></Q></P>
<P>If scholiasts would but make themselves masters of the text, before they sit down to write comments on it, they would be saved a world of trouble in puzzle and conjecture. It is true, they would not have such frequent opportunities of dis∣playing their ingenuity; but then they would frequently avoid falling into absurdity; so that, as our editor observes on ano∣ther occasion, they would gain on one side what they lose on the other; for, as Merry Andrew critically remarks of his dancing pigs, what they now get by footing and casting off, they lose by setting corners and turning round.</P>

</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton, to whom Dr. Johnson sticks, like one of the conjuror's familiars, to the skirts of Trappolin, says,
<Q>the words are here oddly shuffled into nonsense. We should read,</Q>
says he,
<Q><L>—pierce the still-moving air,</L>
<L>That sings with piercing,—</L></Q>
<Q>i. e. pierce the air, which is in perpetual motion, and suf∣fers no injury by piercing.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="132"/>To this Dr. Johnson adds nothing on the page before us; but tells us, in his appendix, that
<Q>for <HI>piercing</HI> air we should read <HI>piecing</HI> air.</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>piecing</HI> air, it is true, is very much of a <HI>piece</HI> with the rest of our editor's annotations; but what he means by it, I cannot conceive; any more than I can find out what Dr. Warburton means by the <HI>perpetual motion</HI> of the air, which prevents it from being injured by piercing. In my opinion, however, the meaning of Shakespeare in this passage is ob∣vious. It is notorious that the epithet <HI>still-piercing,</HI> or <HI>silently-piercing,</HI> is applicable to the air on more occasions than one. A cold air is a piercing air; and indeed, whether the air be cold or hot, it silently pierces or penetrates into the inmost recesses of place, and even the pores of many apparently solid bodies. It is likewise notorious, that a cannon or musket∣ball whizzes or whistles as it passes through or pierces the air; which being converted, poetica licentia, from the pa∣tient to the agent, and vice versa, may, with great propriety, be said to <HI>sing with piercing,</HI> i. e. with <HI>being pierced,</HI> though it <HI>pierces silently</HI> itself. And thus we see evidently the antithesis intended by the poet, which hath escaped the penetrating looks and piercing eyes of his commentators.</P>

<P>I judged it expedient to make so large a quotation from the text, in order that the reader might form some judgment of his own, before he entered on the perplexing annotations; to which two or three of the above lines have given rise.</P>
<P>Dr. Warburton's note, as quoted by Dr. Johnson, is as follows:</P>
<P><Q><HI>What is not holy that we swear not</HI> BY.] Yes, nothing is more common than such kind of oaths. But Diana is not here accusing Bertram for swearing by a being not holy, but for swearing to an unholy purpose; as is evident from the preceding lines.
<Q><L>'Tis not the many oaths, that make the truth;</L>
<L>But the plain single vow, that is vow'd true.</L></Q>
The line in question, therefore, is evidently corrupt, and should be read thus;
<Q>What is not holy, that we swear, not <HI>'BIDES:</HI></Q>
i. e. If we swear to an unholy purpose, the oath abides not, but is dissolved in the making. This is an answer to the purpose. She subjoins the reason two or three lines after;
<Q><L>—this has no <HI>holding,</HI></L>
<L>To swear by him, whom I protest to love;</L>
<L>That I will work against him.</L></Q>
<PB N="119" REF="134"/>
i. e. That oath can never hold, whose subject is to offend and displease that being, whom I profess, in the act of swearing by him, to love and reverence.—What may have misled the editors into the common reading was, per∣haps, mistaking Bertram's words above,
<Q>By love's own sweet constraint,</Q>
to be an oath; whereas it only signifies, being constrained by love.</Q></P>
<P>This note of Dr. Warburton's, the argument of which is as false as the emendation proposed is constrained and un∣couth, is highly commended by the present editor. His an∣notation is as follows:</P>
<P><Q>This is an acute and excellent conjecture, and I have done it the due honour of exalting it to the text; yet, methinks, there is something yet wanting. The following words, <HI>but take the High'st to witness,</HI> even though it be un∣derstood as an anticipation or assumption in this sense,—but now suppose that you <HI>take the</HI> High'st to witness,—has not sufficient relation to the antecedent sentence, I will propose a reading nearer to the surface, and let it take its chance.

Bertram means to enfore his suit, by telling her, that he has bound himself to her, not by the petty protestations usual among lovers, but by vows of greater solemnity. She then makes a proper and rational reply.</Q></P>
<P>Again, Dr. Johnson conceives another part of the above quotation to be corrupt; which, as it may something affect
<PB N="120" REF="135"/>
the sense of the whole, I chuse to take notice of here, altho' the editor considers it in a distinct note.</P>
<Q><L>To swear by him whom I protest to love,</L>
<L>That I will work against him:</L></Q>
<P>This passage like∣wise
<Q>appears to me corrupt. She swears not <HI>by</HI> him whom she <HI>loves,</HI> but by <HI>Jupiter.</HI> I believe we may read <HI>to swear</HI> to <HI>him.</HI> There is, says she, no holding, no consistency, in swearing to one that <HI>I love him,</HI> when I swear it only to <HI>in∣jure</HI> him.</Q></P>
<P>But farther, Dr. Johnson, on reconsidering this passage, tells us, in his appendix, that
<Q>in the print of the old folio, it is doubtful whether it is <HI>Jove's</HI> or <HI>Love's,</HI> the characters being not distinguishable. If it is read <HI>Love's,</HI> perhaps it may be something less difficult. I am still at a loss.</Q>
—And so, by this time, I presume, is the reader. But, as the poet says,
<Q>Who shall decide when doctors disagree?</Q>
Doubtless nobody less than he that has been dubb'd or capt twice; and he may authoritatively plead the same right of pre-eminence over a single graduate, as <HI>two</HI> marrow-puddings have prerogatively over <HI>one</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I hope none of the learned doctors of Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin, nor even those of Edinburgh, Glascow, or Lambeth, will be offended at the vulgarity of this comparison. Had they been in∣vested, however, with their doctorial dignities at Rheims, Louvain, or Harderwyk, they would readily see into the propriety of com∣paring a diploma to a marrow-pudding. It is, indeed, a choice simile, but I cannot now tarry to illustrate it.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>How far the author of the Revisal may be qualified to de∣termine this matter, I cannot pretend to say; being, to my regret, utterly unacquainted with the name and quality of that writer. But, as I think he hath explained this passage better than either of the graduated gentlemen above quoted, I shall not follow Dr. Johnson's example, by cloathing his sentiments in different words, and passing them off as my own.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="136"/>The Reviser's remarks on the passage in question, are as follow:
<Q><L>What is not holy, that we swear, not 'bides,—</L>
<L>But take the High'st to witness.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. War∣burton
<Q>hath so strangely puzzled himself about this passage, that he hath at last quite lost sight of its drift and purpose, and given us one of the most elaborate pieces of nonsense to be found in his whole performance. The common reading, however,
<Q><L>What is not holy, that we swear not by,</L>
<L>But take the High'st to witness,</L></Q>
is, if he could have been content with it, extremely plain and clear. The sense is, We never swear by what is not holy, but swear by, or take to witness the highest, the di∣vinity. The tenor of the reasoning contained in the fol∣lowing lines perfectly corresponds with this; if I should swear by Jove's great attributes, that I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, when you found by experience that I loved you ill, and was endeavouring to gain credit with you, in order to reduce you to your ruin! No, surely, but you would conclude that I had no faith either in Jove or his attributes, and that my oaths were mere words of course. For that oath can certainly have no tie upon us, which we swear by him we profess to love and honour, when at the same time we give the strongest proof of our disbelief in him, by pursuing a course, which we know will offend and dishonour him.</Q>
—</P>
<P>The Reviser is here very near the truth, but hath neither fully confuted Dr. Warburton, nor prevented the difficulties suggested by Dr. Johnson. He is also mistaken in supposing the words <HI>this has no holding</HI> to mean <HI>such an oath is not binding</HI>; since, be other matters as they may, nothing I think is plainer than that she means, as Dr. Johnson says, <HI>There is no consistency.</HI> And this explanation of those words, though
<PB N="122" REF="137"/>
it be our editor's own, is what militates against the alteration of <HI>by</HI> into <HI>to,</HI> as he proposes; which alteration, however, is otherwise very plausible, if the sense of the passage had ab∣solutely required it.</P>
<P>Let us see what we can make of it, without alteration.</P>
<P>Bertram tells Diana that he loves her, and he swears to it <HI>By love's own sweet constraint.</HI> No, says Dr. Warburton, this is no oath; he only says he loves her by love's own sweet con∣straint; having said in the preceding line, speaking of Helena,
<Q><L>I was compell'd to her, but I love thee</L>
<L>By love's own constraint.—</L></Q>
But what is this but saying,
<Q><HI>I was compelled to love Helena</HI> by my father, <HI>but I was compelled to love thee</HI> by Love him∣self.</Q>
Thus we see, it is still as Falstaff says, upon <HI>com∣pulsion</HI>; and if readings were as plenty as black-berries, I would adopt none of them upon compulsion. Besides, it does not appear that Bertram loves Helena at all. It is very presumable that Bertram <HI>swore,</HI> from Diana's taking him so roundly to task for the profanity of his oath. He said thus;
<Q><L><HI>I was</HI> COMPELL'D <HI>to</HI> her, but I LOVE thee—</L>
<L>By <HI>LOVE's OWN</HI> sweet constraint—</L></Q>
i. e. I was forced to wed Helena, but thou art the woman I love.—She was my father's choice, thou art mine.—Yes, by all the powers of love, i. e. by that power which influ∣enced my choice, thou art.—To which power, compared with the tyrannical authority of his father, he was very aptly and naturally induced to give the name of <HI>Love's own sweet constraint.</HI></P>
<P>But, supposing he did not mean to swear by the powers or power of love at this particular conjuncture, it appears, I think, pretty evident, that this was his usual oath, or mode of vowing. Else, why should he answer, after being so se∣verely
<PB N="123" REF="138"/>
schooled about his not swearing by the <HI>Highest,</HI> as the only holy object to swear by,
<Q><L>—<HI>Love</HI> is <HI>holy.</HI></L>
<L>And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts,</L>
<L>That you do charge men with.</L></Q>
What then becomes of Dr. Warburton's <HI>acute and excellent conjecture,</HI> to which Dr. Johnson <HI>hath done the due honour of exalting it to the text?</HI> Dr. Warburton says, that <HI>Diana is not accusing Bertram for swearing by a Being not holy, but for swearing to an unholy purpose.</HI> Indeed, she is accusing him of both, and pleads the former as a proof of the latter. You cannot swear, says she, with any good design, or to any good purpose, when you swear by such profane objects. For, it is to be observed, that the words <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>true</HI> are not here con∣fined to the mere veracity of the terms of the oath <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>But, as in Pandulph's speech, in the play of King John, page 449, where <HI>truth,</HI> applied also, in like manner, to an oath, relates, as our editor himself observes, to <HI>rectitude</HI> of conduct. Thus, when Diana says
<Q><L>'Tis not the many oaths that make the <HI>truth</HI>;</L>
<L>But the plain single vow, that is vow'd <HI>true</HI>;</L></Q>
she does not mean simply that a multiplicity of oaths will not make that true which is otherwise false; for this is not to be done at any rate; yet, what she means to say is confessely to be effected by
<Q>—the plain single vow that is vow'd true.</Q>
What she means, therefore, is this; <HI>a multiplicity of vague and pro∣fane oaths</HI> will not justify any immoral conduct or design; but that any questionable design is to be justified only by the <HI>plain single vow, that is vowed true</HI>; i. e. sworn in a regular and sacred manner. And hence she proceeds to say,
<Q>What is not holy that we swear not by, &amp;c.</Q></P></NOTE>. Diana did not doubt that Bertram had a love or a passion for her, according to the common acceptation of the term. It was to

the other part of his vow that she alludes; for he not only tells her he <HI>loves</HI> her; but
<Q><L>—will for ever</L>
<L>Do her all rights of service.</L></Q>
To which she answers,
<Q><L>Ay, so you serve us,</L>
<L>'Till we serve you: but when you have our roses,</L>
<L>You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,</L>
<L>And mock us with our bareness.</L></Q>
To this Bertram eagerly replies,
<Q>How have I sworn!</Q>
To which Diana as shrewdly answers—
<Q>'Tis not the many oaths, &amp;c.</Q>
As much as if she had said, <HI>Ay, how indeed!—by a multi∣plicity of vague and profane oaths: but what are these, when there is neither a moral possibility of your performing your promise, nor would there be any moral rectitude in it if you did? For you cannot, in such case, take a single formal oath, and call the</HI> HIGHEST <HI>to witness the truth of your promise, without making a mock of his great attributes; viz. goodness and truth.</HI></P>
<P>What then becomes of Dr. Johnson's first alteration; his supposed necessity of dividing this speech between Bertram and Diana; an alteration that would totally pervert the mean∣ing of the passage?</P>
<P>As to his latter alteration, though it be less exceptionable, it is equally unnecessary. For, taking the meaning of the words in the sense above-mentioned, the whole is perfectly intelligible and consistent. <HI>If we take the High'st to witness,</HI> says Diana, (which, it is already observed, is done only when the intent of the oath is morally good) THEN, i. e. <HI>in that ease, pray tell me,</HI>
<Q>If <HI>I</HI> should swear by Jove's great attributes,</Q>
i. e. goodness and truth,
<Q><PB N="125" REF="140"/>
<L>I <HI>LOV'D YOU</HI> dearly, would <HI>YOU</HI> believe <HI>MY</HI> oaths</L>
<L>When I did love you <HI>ILL</HI>?—</L></Q>
i. e. wickedly, immorally.
<Q><L>—This has no holding,</L>
<L>To swear by <HI>HIM,</HI> whom <HI>I</HI> protest to <HI>LOVE,</HI></L>
<L>That I will work against him.</L></Q>
i. e. This is inconsistent to swear by the God of truth and holiness, whom I protest to love, that I will act dishonestly and wickedly. Nay, should we even admit with Dr. War∣burton and the Reviser, that
<Q>—This has no <HI>holding</HI></Q>
means that the oath can never <HI>hold</HI> or is not <HI>binding</HI>; this will make no difference with regard to the alteration proposed; the meaning of the lines, in that case, being only similar to those of Pandulph to King John:
<Q><L>It is religion that doth make vows kept,</L>
<L>But thou hast sworn against religion:</L>
<L>By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st.</L></Q>
But it may be asked, why doth Diana protest that she loves the supreme Being by whom she supposes herself to swear?—If we reflect, however, that this protestation is nothing more than that of her love to virtue, it is by no means improperly introduced to check Bertram's illicit passion, by depriving him of all hopes of success. For it is to be remarked, that though she barely mention the ill consequences to herself of being afterwards abandoned by Bertram, the point on which she dwells upon most, and seems to lay the greatest stress, is the immorality of the act. It may be added also, that, as Bertram hath not here made use of that very expression, in his vows to Diana, it is not impossible that she refers to some other conversation, in which he had not only sworn by love's own sweet constraint, but also by <HI>her own sweet self,</HI> in which case it is, with great propriety, she introduces, by way of an∣tithesis, the protestation of her love to the God of truth and
<PB N="126" REF="141"/>
goodness, being opposed to any love she can possibly entertain for him.—And this supposition is not ill-founded, if we re∣flect on his calling her TITLED GODDESS, and his confessedly making use only of the oaths common to lovers.</P>
<Q><L>My mother told me just how he would woo,</L>
<L>As if she sate in's heart; she says all men</L>
<L>Have the like oaths.—</L></Q>
<P>As to the alteration, suggested in our editor's appendix, and founded on the bad print of the old folio, I am of a different opinion to Dr. Johnson, and think that, instead of making the difficulty less, it would make it much greater. I give my vote, therefore, for having the text stand as it did, before either Dr. Warburton or Dr. Johnson meddled with it;—except that the reader may, if he pleases, add a comma after HIM;
<Q>To swear by HIM, whom I protest to love.</Q></P>

<P>A pox on him, he's a cat still.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>That is, says Dr. Johnson, throw him how you will, he lights on his legs.</P></Q>
<P>But why Parolles is like a cat, in respect to lighting upon his legs, I cannot, for the life of me, discover. Bertram had said, on the discovery of Parolles to be a scoundrel, <HI>I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me.</HI> On the exposition of his farther baseness, he says—<HI>he is more and more a cat</HI>; and at last, <HI>Pox on him, he's a cat still.</HI> But, as Bertram gives no hint that he hates a cat for lighting upon her legs, I cannot conceive where Dr. Johnson met with au∣thority for his explanation.</P>
<P>It appears also, that one of our editor's friends was as much at a loss as I am; I mean Mr. Steevens, whose objection to this illustration is inserted in the appendix.
<Q>Bertram, says Mr. Steevens, means no such thing. In a speech or
<PB N="127" REF="142"/>
two before, he declares his aversion to a cat, and now only continues of the same opinion, and says, he hates Parolles as much as a cat. The other meaning will not do, as Parolles could not be meant by the cat, which lights always on its legs, for he is now in a fair way to be totally disconcerted.</Q></P>
<P>To this, however, Dr. Johnson thinks proper to give no other answer than this;
<Q>I am still of my former opinion.</Q></P>
<P>Well said Doctor Johnsonius Obstinatus! Let not loose thy opinion. Thou hast formed it; it is truly thy own conceit, and not a college of wit-crackers should flout me out of my humour.—Thou hast said it.—It is enough.—Thou art too exalted to condescend so low as to explain thyself.

<P>Dr. Johnson is highly offended at the poet, for making the King so ready to forgive his son Bertram.
<Q>Shakespeare, says he, is now hastening to the end of the play, finds his matter sufficient to fill up his remaining scenes, and there∣fore, as on other such occasions, contracts his dialogue, and precipitates his action. Decency required that Ber∣tram's double crime of cruelty and disobedience, joined like∣wise with some hypocrisy, should raise more resentment; and that, though his mother might easily forgive him, his king should more pertinaciously vindicate his own authority, and
<PB N="128" REF="143"/>
Helen's merit: of all this Shakespeare could not be igno∣norant; but Shakespeare wanted to conclude his play.</Q></P>
<P>I shall not here undertake the defence of Shakespeare, as to the propriety of the King's readiness to forgive Bertram, though I think it might easily be done, if we reflect that the match proposed to the young prince was, in itself, very ab∣surd and preposterous. The King laid the foundation for, and provoked, the act of disobedience in his son, which was there∣fore the more excusable; for it will hardly be admitted, by any person in his right senses, that the paternal authority of the King ought to have carried him so far as to degrade the heir apparent to his crown, by marrying him to the daugh∣ter of a quack, merely because she had had the good luck, by one of her father's nostrums, to cure his majesty of a <HI>fistula in ano.</HI></P>
<P>This circumstance considered also, I think it should have obtained some little favour for the character of Bertram in general, as well from our editor, as from the very ingenious authoress of <HI>Shakespeare Illustrated</HI>; for though he be on the whole a loose, unprincipled fellow, yet I think the absurdity and cruelty of this forced marriage affords a great palliation of his crimes.</P>
<P>But my reason for stopping at this passage, is to remark another instance of our editor's readiness to censure Shake∣speare. Here, truly, Shakespeare hath done wrong in <HI>con∣tracting his dialogue,</HI> because he was in a hurry to finish his play: whereas, before the end of the play, Dr. Johnson finds fault with him again for making his <HI>dialogue too long</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><Q><BIBL>Page 397.</BIBL> <HI>He knows himself,</HI> &amp;c.—]</Q> This dialogue is too long, since the audience already knew the whole transaction; nor is there any reason for puzzling the King, and playing with his passions; but <HI>it was much easier</HI> than to make a pathetical inter∣view between Helen and her husband, her mother, and the King.<BIBL>JOHNSON.</BIBL></Q>—When was Shakespeare ever accused before of wilfully avoiding a proper opportunity of introducing pathetic scenes, on account of the <HI>difficulty</HI> of the task?</P></NOTE>. Our
<PB N="129" REF="144"/>
editor's reasons for these inconsistent censures, however, are sufficiently evident. In the one case he had an opportunity of displaying the poet's precipitancy; and, in the other, of depreciating both his application and abilities.</P>

<P>Knight, Knight, good mother—Basilisco like.</P>

<P>On this passage Mr. Theobald hath a long, and, I think, satisfactory note: he supposes the word <HI>Basilisco,</HI> and the re∣petition of <HI>Knight, Knight,</HI> to refer to an old stupid play called Soliman and Perseda.—</P>
<P>Dr. Warburton tells us the beauty of the passage consists in an allusion to a fixed star of the first magnitude in the constella∣tion Leo. Having inserted the notes of both these commen∣tators at length, the present editor makes very short work with his part of the business, by adding the following saga∣cious animadversion to the latter,
<Q>Could one have thought it!</Q></P>
<P>Could one have thought it, indeed! A mighty pretty way this, of writing annotations on Shakespeare! To copy two long notes from Theobald and Warburton, and then to ex∣claim, concerning some conundrum of the latter, <HI>Could one have thought it!</HI>—Neither your subscribers, nor your book∣sellers, I believe, Dr. Johnson, thought you would have fobbed them off so shabbily. For, indeed, when a man pro∣mised so fair, <HI>Could one have thought it?</HI>—But, perhaps, this is another stroke of our editor's WIT.—It is.—ha!—like enough—but, <HI>could one have thought it?</HI></P>
<P>We have in this play several other notes of similar impor∣tance. Thus page 421, after a long note from Theobald, our editor adds,
<Q>Mr. Theobald had the art of making the
<PB N="130" REF="145"/>
most of his discoveries.</Q>
But this remark, however true it ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be in one sense, is far from being so in another: for though Dr. Johnson hath made very few discoveries of his own, he hath discovered the method of making more of Theobald's at second hand, than ever the author could do, when they were spick and span new.</P>

<P>In this passage our editor hath two notes from Theobald and Warburton; after which ne adopts the opinion of Mr. Edwards, who had exposed the absurdity of the latter, but without mentioning him, as usual.—But I must not pass over a word or two, which Dr. Johnson hath dropt on this occa∣sion. <HI>A commentator,</HI> he says, <HI>should be grave.</HI> But why, now, Doctor, should a commentator be <HI>grave?</HI> You seem very angry, in your Preface, with Mr. Pope, for supposing that the task of an editor must necessarily be <HI>dull.</HI> Now, though there is some distinction of blood between dullness and gravity, they are near a-kin; and so nearly alike in the <HI>face,</HI> that you might take them for sisters; ay, twins, with but half-an-hour's difference in their age. I dare say now that many of your mistaken readers have frequently thought even you <HI>dull,</HI> when I warrant you the <HI>Doctor</HI> was only <HI>grave.</HI> I do not think, therefore, a commentator should wear so much gravity. It is good to guard against mistakes, as they are frequently better prevented than amended. Not that I hold it decent for a scholiast to be always upon the broad grin; but if the author himself be chearful, or the absurdities of a brother commentator set him a laughing, where is the crime of indulging himself in it?—After this, let us hear no more of the <HI>gravity</HI> of a commentator <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to Johnson's Shakespeare.</NOTE>.</P>

<Q><L>—If the midnight bell</L>
<L>Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth</L>
<L>Sound ONE unto the drowsy race of night.</L></Q>
<P>The folio edition has it <HI>sound</HI> ON; but our editor hath al∣tered it either on the authority of Dr. Warburton, or his own, without giving any reason for such alteration. His friend Mr. Steevens, however, thinks the old reading right, and conceives the meaning to be this;
<Q><HI>if the midnight bell, by repeated strokes, was to hasten away the race of beings that are busy at that hour, or quicken night in its progress,</HI> the morning bell (that is the bell that strikes <HI>one</HI>) could never properly be made the agent, for the bell has ceased to be in the service of night when it proclaims the arrival of day. <HI>Sound</HI> ON has a particular propriety, because, by the repeti∣tion of the strokes at twelve, it gives a much more forcible warning than when it only strikes <HI>one.</HI></Q>
—This criticism is admitted by Dr. Johnson into his appendix; but as he does not there retract his former judgment, we may suppose he still coincides with Dr. Warburton: or perhaps his own opi∣nion is suspended between both. Mr. Steevens's note is in∣genious enough indeed (as our editor expresses himself on an∣other occasion) to <HI>deserve to be true</HI>; but if the single autho∣rity of the folio edition may be set aside, I am afraid the double authority of two such learned and tremendous critics as Dr. Johnson and the Bishop of Gloucester, will go likely to involve Shakespeare in the absurdity of supposing the clock strikes but <HI>one</HI> to acquaint us of <HI>midnight.</HI> For that the last right reverend critic doth not think midnight merely a point of time, dividing night from morning, is evident from his comment on another passage of Shakespeare's, in the Mid-summer Night's Dream, where, instead of <HI>the third part of a minute,</HI> he would have us read <HI>the third part of the midnight.</HI> Now points of time, as well as points of space, are unex∣tended
<PB N="132" REF="147"/>
and indivisible; and yet the present editor makes no other objection to this proposed amendment, than that of silently rejecting it: but as this rejection is founded on other rea∣sons than the impropriety here mentioned, we may very rea∣sonably suppose that Dr. Johnson, as well as Dr. Warburton, hath found out that midnight is a determinate quantity of du∣ration, comprehending at least all that space of time which elapses between twelve at night and one in the morning! This admitted, it is no wonder that Mr. Steevens's note should appear exceptionable; for if <HI>he,</HI> on the supposition that when <HI>night</HI> is past it must be <HI>morning,</HI> can with propriety call the bell which strikes <HI>twelve</HI> a midnight bell, <HI>they</HI> might with still more propriety, on their supposition, call that a midnight bell which strikes <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>My readers will probably think I have here set the com∣mentators together by the ears, only to perplex and confound both them and the poet.—Not at all.—The commentators were at odds before I meddled with them; and I have only brought them together, to shew my own critical dexterity in reconciling them to each other, and extricating Shakespeare out of the hands of both.—For instance, now—To you, Mr. Steevens, I attribute the honour or having illustrated the poet's meaning, on the supposition that he wrote <HI>strike</HI> ON: but, Sir, I shall prove to your teeth, in savour of your opponents, that <HI>their</HI> reading of the text may be right; and this even from your own argument. You suppose that the bell, which strikes <HI>one,</HI> is a morning bell—granted—it hath been so a full hour; ever since the hand came to the point, and the clapper struck the first stroke of twelve. For you must not conceive that Time stands stock-still till the clock hath done striking the whole dozen: and if it does not, the bell must, according to you, be called a morning bell after the first stroke; so that we see there is even a physical impossibility of a <HI>midnight</HI> bell's striking more than ONE. What then be∣comes of your repeated strokes, and your midnight bell's
<PB N="133" REF="148"/>
striking ON? <HI>Silence that dreadful bell, then, it disturbs the</HI> text <HI>from its propriety.</HI>—EUGE, MAGNE.—Here was I going to congratulate myself on having topt all the commenta∣tors, even in their <HI>own way,</HI> and on the wonderful acuteness displayed in <HI>adjusting</HI> this nice dispute; but recollecting the fate of poor Theobald, and how severely he hath been handled for boasting and <HI>making the most</HI> of his discoveries, I will wrap myself up in the buff doublet of my own suffi∣ciency, and leave the world to do justice to merit, or let it alone, as it thinks proper.</P>
