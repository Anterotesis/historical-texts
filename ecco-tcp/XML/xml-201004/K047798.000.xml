<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE want of a proper set of exercises, ap∣plied to the different branches of mathematical knowledge, which are deemed requisite to the military profession, induced me to draw up the following sheets. Their utility to the students in the Royal Military Academy, having been fully established, recommended them to the consider∣ation of the Master General; and His Grace has been pleased to order them to be printed.</P>
<P>The miscellaneous form of this small work, arises from its consisting chiefly of practical ques∣tions in most of the sciences now taught in the Academy. Although Invention was not my im∣mediate object, yet throughout the whole there will be found many things that are new, in
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>point of matter, but more so in the manner of treating the subjects.</P>
<P>In the Conic Sections there are several new and important properties dispersed through the books; and it is presumed that this branch is treated in a way better adapted to its intended use, than heretofore. The propositions, although demonstrated in a manner strictly geometrical, have this peculiarity, that only the first pro∣perty of each section is demonstrated from the cone itself, and all the subsequent ones derived from the first, or from each other, in an easy and natural way, without introducing any arbitrary organical description of curves in plano. The arrangement of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eps in separate lines is also found to be an advantage, as it renders the demonstrations more easy to be comprehended, by presenting the whole to the eye in one con∣nected view. And another very considerable im∣provement arises from the application of a new and general property concerning the inter∣sections of a right line, with any of the curves, in two points: by means of which the general properties of the oblique ordinates, to any dia∣meter, are easily deduced, without the forced and perplexed consideration of the areas of cer∣tain spaces.</P>
<P>The several propositions and properties, in the three curves or sections, are also arranged in such
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>order, and enunciated in such manner, as to shew which properties are common to the different sections; and in particular it will be found, that most of the definitions and scholia are common to all the three curves; and that all the pro∣positions and demonstrations of the ellipse, are literally the same with those of the hyperbola: a circumstance which must render both the learning and the remembering of the properties much easier than heretofore.</P>
<P>The collection of practical questions, which follow the Conic Sections, are mostly given without solutions, their answers only being set down, as probationary exercises to certain rules and branches of science contained in most books relating to these subjects. But the last collection, concerning forces, and the accompanying cir∣cumstances of time, space, and the velocity ge∣nerated, have solutions annexed to them; as they require a knowledge of some other principles be∣sides those that are usually found in the common books of science. Many of the problems in this part may, indeed, be met with elsewhere; but it is presumed, that the solutions will be found in general, either new, or attended with considerable improvement.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty also to enrich this part with some new and useful problems relating
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>to the times of filling and emptying the ditches of fortifications, or other receptacles, with water, entering and evacuating them under certain cir∣cumstances. These curious problems, His Grace the Master General of the Ordnance was pleased to propose at a late examination of the Gen∣tlemen Cadets; and the solutions at large, of such important propositions, are here published, as far as I know, for the first time.</P>
<P>To these succeeds the common theory of the motion of bodies in resisting mediums, but de∣livered in a manner, I trust, better adapted to practical purposes than in any former publi∣cation.</P>
<P>The volume then concludes with a com∣pendium of some experiments, lately made to ascertain the actual resistance of the air to given surfaces, moving through it with given velocities, and different degrees of inclination: experiments, which it is to be wished may be farther prosecuted, as it is by such means only that the true theory of military projectiles, as well as other branches of natural philosophy, can be improved to any degree of practical utility.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DEFINITIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CONIC sections are the figures made by the mu∣tual intersection of a cone and a plane.</P>
<P N="2">2. According to the different positions of the cutting plane, there arise five different figures or sections, namely, a triangle, a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, and an hyperbola: the three last of which only are peculiarly called conic sections.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the cutting plane pass through the vertex of the cone, and any part of the base, the section will evidently be a triangle; as VAB.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="4">4. If the plane cut the cone parallel to the base, or make no angle with it, the section will be a circle; as ABD.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="2" REF="11"/>5. The section DAB is an ellipse, when the cone is cut obliquely through both sides, or when the plane is in∣clined to the base in a less angle than the side of the cone is.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="6">6. The section is a parabola, when the cone is cut by a plane parallel to the base, or when the cutting plane and the side of the cone make equal angles with the base.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="7">7. The section is an hyperbola, when the cutting plane makes a greater angle with the base than the side of the cone makes.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="8">8. And if all the sides of the cone be continued through the vertex, forming an opposite equal cone, and the plane be also continued to cut the opposite cone, this latter section will be the opposite hyper∣bola to the former; as dBe.</P>
<P N="9">9. The vertices of any section, are the points where the cutting plane meets the opposite sides of the cone, or the sides of the vertical triangular section; as A and B.</P>
<P>Hence the ellipse and the opposite hyperbolas, have each two vertices; but the parabola only one; unless we con∣sider the other as at an infinite distance.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Axis, or Transverse Diameter, of a conic section, is the line or distance AB between the vertices.</P>
<P>Hence the axis of a parabola is infinite in length, Ab being only a part of it.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P N="11">11. The Center C is the middle of the axis.</P>
<P>Hence the center of a parabola is infinitely distant from the vertex. And of an ellipse the axis and center lie within the curve; but of an hyperbola without.</P>
<P N="12">12. A Diameter is any right line, as AB or DE, drawn through the center, and terminated on each side by the curve; and the extremities of the diameter, or its inter∣sections with the curve, are its vertices.</P>
<P>Hence all the diameters of a parabola are parallel to the axis, and infinite in length. And hence also every diame∣ter of the ellipse and hyperbola have two vertices; but of the parabola only one; unless we consider the other as at an infinite distance.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Conjugate to any diameter, is the line drawn through the center, and parallel to the tangent of the curve at the vertex of the diameter. So FG, parallel to the tan∣gent at D, is the conjugate to DE; and HI, parallel to the tangent at A, is the conjugate to AB.</P>
<P>Hence the conjugate HI, of the axis AB, is perpendi∣cular to it.</P>

<P N="14">14. An Ordinate to any diameter, is a line parallel to its conjugate, or to the tangent at its vertex, and termi∣nated by the diameter and curve. So DK, EL are ordi∣nates to the axis AB; and MN, NO ordinates to the diame∣ter DE.</P>
<P>Hence the ordinates to the axis are perpendicular to it.</P>
<P N="15">15. An Absciss is a part of any diameter contained be∣tween its vertex and an ordinate to it; as AK or BK, or DN or EN.</P>
<P>Hence, in the ellipse and hyperbola, every ordinate has two abscisses; but in the parabola, only one; the other vertex of the diameter being infinitely distant.</P>
<P N="16">16. The Parameter of any diameter, is a third pro∣portional to that diameter and its conjugate.</P>
<P N="17">17. The Focus is the point in the axis where the ordi∣nate is equal to half the parameter. As K and L, where DK or EL is equal to the semi-parameter.</P>
<P>Hence, the ellipse and hyperbola have each two foci; but the parabola only one.</P>
<P N="18">18. If DAE, FBG be two opposite hyperbolas having AB for their first or transverse axis, and ab for their second or
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE> conjugate axis. And if dae, fbg be two other opposite hyperbolas having the same axes, but in the contrary order, namely, ab their first axis, and AB their second; then these two latter curves dae, fbg, are called the con∣jugate hyperbolas to the two former DAE, FBG; and each pair of opposite curves mutually conjugate to the other.</P>
<P N="19">19. And if tangents be drawn to the four vertices of the curves, or extremities of the axes, forming the in∣scribed rectangle HIKL; the diagonals HCK, ICL of this rectangle, are called the asymptotes of the curves.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="scholium">
<HEAD>SCHOLIUM.</HEAD>
<P>The rectangle inscribed between the four conjugate hyperbolas, is similar to a rectangle circumscribed about an ellipse by drawing tangents, in like manner, to the four extremities of the two axes; and the asymptotes or diagonals in the hyperbola, are analogous to those in the ellipse, cutting this curve in similar points, and making the pair of equal conjugate diameters. Moreover, the whole figure, formed by the four hyperbolas, is, as it were, an ellipse turned inside out, cut open at the ex∣tremities D, E, F, G, of the said equal conjugate diameters, and those four points drawn out to an infinite distance, the curvature being turned the contrary way, but the axes, and the rectangle passing through their extremities, continuing fixed.</P>

<P>In the ellipse, the semi-conjugate axis, CD or CE, is a mean proportional between CO and CP, the parts of the diameter OP of a circle drawn through the center C of the ellipse, and parallel to the base of the cone. For DE is a double ordinate in this circle, being perpendicular to OP as well as to AB.</P>
<P>In like manner, in the hyperbola, the length of the semi-conjugate axis, CD or CE, is a mean proportional between CO and CP, drawn parallel to the base, and meet∣ing the sides of the cone in O and P. Or, if AO′ be drawn parallel to the side VB, and meet PC produced in O′, making CO′ = CO; and on this diameter O′P a circle be drawn parallel to the base: then the semi-conjugate CD or CE will be an ordinate of this circle, being perpendi∣cular to O′P as well as to AB.</P>
<P>Or, in both figures, the whole conjugate axis DE is a mean proportional between QA and BR, parallel to the base of the cone. For, because AB is double of AC or CB, therefore, by similar triangles, QA is double of OC, and BR double of CP; consequently</P>
<P>DE<SUP>2</SUP> or 2C · 2E, or 2CO · 2CP is = QA · BR, or QA ∶ DE ∷ DE ∶ BR.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16"/>In the parabola both the transverse and conjugate are infinite; for AB and BR are both infinite.</P>
<P>COROL. 2. In all the sections AG will be equal to the parameter of the axis, if QG be drawn making the angle AQG equal to the angle BAR.</P>
<P>For, by the definition, AB ∶ DE ∷ DE ∶ <HI>p</HI> the param. But by corol. 1, BR ∶ DE ∷ DE ∶ AQ; Therefore AB ∶ BR ∷ AQ ∶ <HI>p.</HI> But, by similar triangles, AB ∶ BR ∷ AQ ∶ AG; And therefore AG = <HI>p</HI> the parameter.</P>
<P>In like manner Bg will be equal to the parameter <HI>p,</HI> if Rg be drawn to make the angle BRg = the angle ABQ; since here also AB ∶ AQ ∷ BR ∶ BG = <HI>p.</HI></P>
<P>COROL. 3. Hence the upper hyperbolic section, or section of the opposite cone, is equal and similar to the lower section. For the two sections have the same transverse or first axis AB, and the same conjugate or second axis DE, which is the mean proportional between AQ and RB; they have also equal parameters AG, Bg. So that the two opposite sections make, as it were, but the two opposite ends of one entire section or hyperbola, the two being every where mutually equal and similar. Like the two halves of an ellipse, with their ends turned the contrary way.</P>
<P>COROL. 4. And hence, although both the transverse and conjugate axis in the parabola be infinite, yet the former is infinitely greater than the latter, or has an infinite ratio to it. For the transverse has the same ratio to the conjugate, as the conjugate has to the parameter, that is, as an infinite to a finite quantity, which is an infinite ratio.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE ELLIPSE.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P>The Squares of the Ordinates of the Axis are to each other as the Rectangles of their Abscisses.</P>
<P>Let AVB be a plane passing through the axis of the cone; AGIH another section of the cone perpendicular to the plane of the former; AB the axis of this elliptic section; and FG, HI ordinates perpendicular to it. Then I say that FG<SUP>2</SUP> ∶ HI<SUP>2</SUP> ∷ AF·FB ∶ AH·HB.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>For, through the ordinates FG, HI draw the circular sections KGL, MIN parallel to the base of the cone, having KL, MN for their diameters, to which FG, HI are ordinates, as well as to the axis of the ellipse.</P>
<P>Now, by the similar triangles AFL, AHN, and BFL, BHM, we have AF ∶ AH ∷ FL ∶ HN, and FB ∶ HB ∷ KF ∶ MH; hence, taking the rectangles of the corresponding terms, we have the rect. AF·FB ∶ AH·HB ∷ KF·FL ∶ MH·HN. But, by the nature of the circle, KF·FL = FG<SUP>2</SUP>, and MH·HN = HI<SUP>2</SUP>; Therefore the rect. AF·FB ∶ AH·HB ∷ FG<SUP>2</SUP> ∶ HI<SUP>2</SUP>. Q.E.D.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18"/>COROL. 1. All the parallel sections are similar figures, or have their two axes in the same proportion; that is, AB ∶ ab ∷ DE ∶ de.</P>
<P>For, by sim. triang. AB ∶ ab ∷ AQ ∶ aq, and AB ∶ ab ∷ RB ∶ rb; Theref. by comp. AB<SUP>2</SUP> ∶ ab<SUP>2</SUP> ∷ AQ·RB ∶ aq·rb. But AQ·RB = DE<SUP>2</SUP>, and aq·rb = de<SUP>2</SUP>; Therefore AB<SUP>2</SUP> ∶ ab<SUP>2</SUP> ∷ DE<SUP>2</SUP> ∶ de<SUP>2</SUP>, or AB ∶ ab ∷ DE ∶ de.</P>
<P>COROL. 2. Hence also, as the property is the same for the ordinates on both sides of the diameter, it follows, that</P>
<P N="1">1st. At equal distances from the center, or from the vertices, the ordinates on both sides are equal, or that the double ordinates are bisected by the axis; and that the whole figure, made up of all the double ordinates, is also bisected by the axis.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The two foci are equally distant from the center, or from either vertex.</P>
<P>COROL. 3. When the angle, which the plane of the section makes with the base of the cone, increases till it be∣come equal to the angle made by the side of the cone and the base, or till the section be parallel to the opposite side of the base; then the axis becomes infinitely long, and the ellipse degenerates into a parabola; and because then the infinites FB and HB are in a ratio of equality, the general property, namely AF·FB ∶ AH·HB ∷ FG<SUP>2</SUP> ∶ HI<SUP>2</SUP>, becomes AF ∶ AH ∷ FG<SUP>2</SUP> ∶ HI<SUP>2</SUP>, or, in the parabola, the abscisses are to each other, as the squares of their ordinates.</P>

<P><PB N="13" REF="22"/>COROL. 1. If two circles be described on the two axes as diameters, the one inscribed within the ellipse, and the other circumscribed about it; then an ordinate in the circle will be to the corresponding ordinate in the ellipse, as the axis of this ordinate, is to the other axis.</P>
<P>That is, CA ∶ Ca ∷ DG ∶ DE, and Ca ∶ CA ∷ dg ∶ dE.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE PILING OF BALLS AND SHELLS.</HEAD>
<P>IRON balls and shells are commonly piled, by horizontal courses, either in a pyramidical or wedge-like form; the base being either an equilateral triangle, a square, or a rectangle. In the triangle and square, the pile will finish in a single ball; but in the rectangle, it will finish in a single row of balls, like an edge.</P>
<P>In triangular and square piles, the number of horizontal rows, or courses, is always equal to the number of balls in one side of the bottom row. And in rectangular piles, the number of rows is equal to the number of balls in the breadth of the bottom row. Also in the number in the top row, or edge, is one more than the difference between the length and breadth of the bottom row.</P>

<HEAD>OF DISTANCES BY THE VELOCITY OF SOUND.</HEAD>
<P>BY various experiments it has been found that sound flies, through the air, uniformly at the rate of about 1142 feet in 1 second of time, or a mile in 4⅔ seconds. And therefore, by proportion, any distance may be found cor∣responding to any given time; namely, multiply the given time, in seconds, by 1142, for the corresponding distance in feet; or take 3/14 of the given time for the distance in miles.</P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> The time for the passage of sound in the inter∣val between seeing the flash of a gun, or lightning, and hearing the report, may be observed by a watch, or a small pendulum.

<HEAD>PRACTICAL EXERCISES CONCERNING FORCES; WITH THE RELATION BETWEEN THEM AND THE TIME, VELOCITY, AND SPACE DESCRIBED.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE entering upon the following problems, it will be convenient here to lay down a synopsis of the theorems which express the several relations between any forces, and their corresponding times, velocities, and spaces described; which are all comprehended in the following 12 theorems.</P>
<P>Let <HI>f,</HI> F be any two constant accelerative forces, acting on any body, during the respective times <HI>t,</HI> T, at the end of which are generated the velocities <HI>v,</HI> v, and described the spaces <HI>s,</HI> S. Then, because the spaces are as the times and velocities conjointly, and the velocities as the forces and times; we shall have,</P>

<P><PB N="169" REF="178"/>And if one of the forces, as F, be the force of gravity at the surface of the earth, and be called 1, and its time T be = 1″; then it is known by experiment that the cor∣responding space S is = 16 1/12 feet, and consequently its velocity V = 2S = 32⅙, which call 2 <HI>g,</HI> namely <HI>g</HI> = 16 1/12 feet or 193 inches.

<P>In these four theorems, the force <HI>f,</HI> though variable, is supposed to be constant for the indefinitely small time <HI>t;</HI> and they are to be used in all cases of variable forces, as the former ones in constant forces; namely, from the circum∣stances
<PB N="170" REF="179"/>of the problem under consideration, deduce an ex∣pression for the value of the force <HI>f,</HI> which substitute in one of these theorems, which shall be proper to the case in hand, and the equation thence resulting will determine the cor∣responding values of the other quantities required in the problem.</P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> That the motive force <HI>m,</HI> of a body, is equal to <HI>fq,</HI> the product of the accelerative force, and the quantity of matter in it; and, therefore, <HI>m</HI> will be found by substituting <HI>m</HI>/<HI>q</HI> for <HI>f</HI> in the theorems above.</P>
<P>Also the momentum, or quantity of motion, is <HI>q v,</HI> the pro∣duct of the velocity and matter.</P>
<P>It is also to be observed, that the theorems equally hold good for the destruction of motion and velocity, by means of retarding forces, as for the generation of the same by means of accelerating forces.</P>
<P>And to the following problems, which are all resolved by the application of these theorems, it has been thought proper to subjoin their solutions, for the better information and con∣venience of the student.</P>
<P>The following table of the most common and useful forms of fluxions and fluents, is inserted, as it will be found very useful for assigning the fluents found in many of the following problems.</P>

<P>When a pendulum vibrates in a circular arc, as the length of the string is constantly the same, the time of vibration will be longer than in a cycloid; but the two times will approach nearer together as the circular arc is smaller; so that when it is very small, the times of vi∣bration will be nearly equal. And hence 39⅛ inches is the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in the very small arc of a circle.</P>

<P>It is proposed to determine the Velocity, and the Time of Vibration, of a Fluid in the Arms of a Canal or bent Tube.</P>
<P>Let the tube ABCDEF have its two branches AC, GE vertical, and the lower part CDE in any position what∣ever, the whole being of a uniform diameter or width throughout. Let water, or quicksilver, or any other fluid, be poured in, till it stand in equilibrio, at any horizontal line BF. Then let one surface be pressed or pushed down by shaking, from B to C, and the other will ascend through the equal space FG; after which let them be permitted freely to return. The surfaces will then continually vibrate in equal times be∣tween AC and EG. The velocity and times of which os∣cillations are therefore required.</P>

<P>When the surfaces are any where out of a horizontal line, as at P and Q, the parts of the fluid in QDR, on each side, below QR, will balance each other; and the weight of the part in PR, which is equal to 2PF, gives motion to the whole So that the weight of the part 2PF is the motive force by which the whole fluid is urged, and there∣fore wt of 2PF / whole wt. is the accelerative force. Which weights being proportional to their lengths, if <HI>l</HI> be the length of the whole fluid, or axis of the tube filled, and <HI>a</HI> = FG or BC; then is <HI>a</HI>/<HI>l</HI> the accelerative force. Put∣ting therefore <HI>x</HI> = GP any variable distance, <HI>v</HI> the
<PB N="207" REF="216"/>velocity, and <HI>t</HI> the time; then PF = <HI>a</HI> − <HI>x,</HI> and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> the accelerative force; hence <HI>vv̇</HI> or 2<HI>gfṡ</HI> = 4<HI>g</HI>/<HI>l</HI> (<HI>aẋ</HI> − <HI>xẋ</HI>); the fluents of which give <HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP> = 4<HI>g</HI>/<HI>l</HI> (2<HI>ax</HI> − <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>), and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> is the general expression for the velocity at any term. And when <HI>x</HI> = <HI>a,</HI> it becomes <HI>v</HI> = 2<HI>a</HI> √ <HI>g</HI>/<HI>l</HI> for the greatest velocity at B and F.</P>
<P>Again, for the time, we have <HI>ṫ</HI> or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; the fluents of which give <HI>t</HI> = ½ √ <HI>l</HI>/<HI>g</HI> × arc to versed sine <HI>x / a</HI> and radius 1, the general expres∣sion for the time.

And which therefore is the same, whatever AB is, the whole length <HI>l</HI> remaining the same.</P>
<P>And the time of vibration is also equal to the time of the vibration of a pendulum whose length is ½<HI>l,</HI> or half the length of the axis of the fluid. So that if the length <HI>l</HI> be 78¼ inches, it will oscillate in 1 second.</P>
<P>SCHOL. This reciprocation of the water in the canal, is nearly similar to the motion of the waves of the sea. For the time of vibration is the same, however short the branches are, provided the whole length be the same. So that when the height is small, in proportion to the length
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>of the canal, the motion is similar to that of a wave, from the top to the bottom or hollow, and from the bottom to the top of the next wave; being equal to two vibra∣tions of the canal; the whole length of a wave, from top to top, being double the length of the canal. Hence the wave will move forward by a space nearly equal to its breadth, in the time of two vibrations of a pendulum whose length is (½<HI>l</HI>) half the length of the canal, or one fourth of the breadth of a wave, or in the time of one vibration of a pendulum whose length is the whole breadth of the wave, since the times of vibration are as the square roots of their lengths. Consequently, waves whose breadth is equal to 39⅛ inches, or 3 25/96 feet, will move over 3 2/9 ⅚ feet in a second, or 195⅝ feet in a minute, or nearly 2 miles and a quarter in an hour. And the velocity of greater or less waves will be increased or diminished in the subduplicate ratio of their breadths.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE MOTION OF BODIES IN FLUIDS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="29" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROBLEM XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>To determine the Force of Fluids in Motion. And the Circumstances attending Bodies moving in Fluids.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is evident that the resistance to a plane, moving perpendicularly through an infinite fluid, at rest, is equal to the pressure or force of the fluid upon the plane at rest, and the fluid moving with the same velocity, and in the contrary direction, to that of the plane in the former case. But the force of the fluid in motion, must be equal to the weight or pressure which generates that motion; and which, it is known, is equal to the weight or pressure of a column of the fluid, whose base is equal to the plane, and its altitude equal to the height through which a body must fall, by the force of gravity, to acquire the ve∣locity of the fluid: and that altitude is, for the sake of brevity, called the altitude due to the velocity. So that, if <HI>a</HI> denote the area of the plane, <HI>v</HI> the velocity, and <HI>n</HI> the specific gravity of the fluid; then, the altitude due to the velocity <HI>v</HI> being <HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/4<HI>g,</HI> the whole resistance, or mo∣tive force <HI>m,</HI> will be <HI>a</HI> × <HI>n</HI> × <HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/4<HI>g</HI> = <HI>anv</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/4<HI>g</HI>; <HI>g</HI> being 16 1/12 feet. And hence, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> the resistance is as the square of the velocity.</P>
<P N="2">2. This ratio, of the square of the velocity, may be otherwise derived thus. The force of the fluid in mo∣tion, must be as the force of one particle multiplied by
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>the number of them: but the force of a particle is as its velocity; and the number that strikes the plane in a given time, is also as the velocity; therefore the whole force is as <HI>v</HI> × <HI>v</HI> or <HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, that is, as the square of the velocity.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the direction of motion, instead of being perpen∣dicular to the plane, as above supposed, were inclined to it in any angle, the sine of that angle being <HI>s,</HI> to the radius 1; then the resistance to the plane, or the force of the fluid against the plane, in the direction of the motion, as assigned above, will be diminished in the triplicate ratio of radius to the sine of the angle of in∣clination, or in the ratio of 1 to <HI>s</HI><SUP>3</SUP>. For, AB being the direction of the plane, and BD that of the motion, making the angle ABD, whose sine is <HI>s;</HI> the num∣ber of particles, or quantity of the fluid, striking the plane, will be diminished in the ratio of 1 to <HI>s,</HI> or of radius to the sine of the angle B of inclination; and the force of each particle will also be diminished in the same ratio of 1 to <HI>s;</HI> so that, on both these accounts, the whole resistance will be diminished in the ratio of 1 to <HI>s</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, or in the duplicate ratio of radius to the sine of the said angle. But again, it is to be considered that this whole resistance is exerted in the direction BE perpendicular to the plane; and any force in the direction BE, is to its effect in the direction AE, parallel to BD, as AE to BF, that is as 1 to <HI>s.</HI> So that finally, on all these accounts, the resistance in the direction of motion, is diminished in the ratio of 1 to <HI>s</HI><SUP>3</SUP>, or in the triplicate ratio of radius to the fine of inclination. Hence, comparing this with article 1, the whole re∣sistance, or the motive force on the plane, will be <HI>m</HI> = <HI>anv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>s</HI><SUP>3</SUP>/4<HI>g.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="223" REF="232"/>4. Also if <HI>w</HI> denote the weight of the body, whose plane face <HI>a</HI> is resisted by the absolute force <HI>m;</HI> then the re∣tarding force <HI>f,</HI> or <HI>m</HI>/<HI>w,</HI> will be <HI>anv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>s</HI><SUP>3</SUP>/4<HI>gw.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. And if the body be a cylinder, whose face or end is <HI>a,</HI> and diameter <HI>d,</HI> or radius <HI>r,</HI> moving in the direction of its axis; because then <HI>s</HI> = 1, and <HI>a</HI> = <HI>pr</HI><SUP>2</SUP> = ¼<HI>pd</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, where <HI>p</HI> = 3.1416; the resisting force <HI>m</HI> will be <HI>npd</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/16<HI>g</HI> = <HI>npr</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/4<HI>g,</HI> and the retarding force <HI>f</HI> = <HI>npd</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/16<HI>gw</HI> = <HI>npr</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/4<HI>gw.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. This is the value of the resistance when the end of the cylinder is a plane perpendicular to its axis, or to the direction of motion. But were its face a conical surface, or an elliptic section, or any other figure every where equally inclined to the axis, the fine of inclination being <HI>s∶</HI> then, the number of particles of the fluid striking the face being still the same, but the force of each, opposed to the direction of motion, diminished in the duplicate ratio of radius to the fine of inclination, the resisting force <HI>m</HI> will be <HI>npd</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>s</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/16<HI>g</HI> = <HI>npr</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>s</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/4<HI>g.</HI> But if the body were terminated by an end or face of any other form, as a spherical one, or such like, where every part of it has a different inclination to the axis, then a farther investigation becomes necessary, such as in the following proposition.</P>

<HEAD>PROBLEM XXX.</HEAD>
<P>To determine the Resistance of a Fluid to any Body, moving in it, of a Curved End, as a Sphere, or a Cylinder with a Hemispherical End, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let BEAD be a section through the axis CA of the solid, moving in the direction of that axis. To any point of the curve draw the tangent EG, meeting the axis produced in G: also draw the perpendicular ordinates EF, of indefinitely near to each other; and draw ae parallel to CG. Putting CF = <HI>x,</HI> EF = <HI>y,</HI> BE = <HI>z, s</HI> = fine ∠ G to radius 1, and <HI>p</HI> = 3.1416; then 2<HI>py</HI> is the circumference whose radius is EF, or the circumference described by the point E, in revolving about the axis CA; and 2<HI>py</HI> × Ee or 2<HI>pyż</HI> is the fluxion of the surface, or the surface described by Ee, in the said revolution about CA, and which is the quantity represented by <HI>a</HI> in art. 3 of the last problem: hence <HI>nv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>s</HI><SUP>3</SUP>/4<HI>g</HI> × 2<HI>pyż</HI> or <HI>pnv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>s</HI><SUP>3</SUP>/2<HI>g</HI> × <HI>yż</HI> is the resistance on that ring, or the fluxion of the resistance to the body, whatever the figure of it may be. And the fluent of which will be the resistance required.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="2">2. In the case of a spherical form, putting the radius CA or CB = <HI>r,</HI> we have <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <HI>yż</HI> or EF × E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> = CE × a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> = <HI>rẋ;</HI> therefore the general fluxion <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> becomes <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; the fluent of which, or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, is the
<PB N="225" REF="234"/>resistance to the spherical surface generated by BE. And when <HI>x</HI> or CF is = <HI>r</HI> or CA, it becomes <HI>pnv</HI><SUP>3</SUP><HI>r</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/8<HI>g</HI> for the resistance on the whole hemisphere; which is also equal to <HI>pnv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>d</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/32<HI>g,</HI> where <HI>d</HI> = 2<HI>r</HI> the diameter.</P>
<P N="3">3. But the perpendicular resistance to the circle of the same diameter <HI>d</HI> or BD, by art. 5 of the preceding pro∣blem, is <HI>pnv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>d</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/16<HI>g</HI>; which, being double the former, shews that the resistance to the sphere, is just equal to half the direct resistance to a great circle of it, or to a cylinder of the same diameter.</P>
<P N="4">4. Since ⅙<HI>pd</HI><SUP>3</SUP> is the magnitude of the globe, if N de∣note its density or specific gravity, its weight <HI>w</HI> will be = ⅙<HI>pd</HI><SUP>3</SUP> N, and therefore the retardive force <HI>f</HI> or <HI>m</HI>/<HI>w</HI> = <HI>pnv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>d</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/32<HI>g</HI> × 6/<HI>p</HI>N<HI>d</HI><SUP>3</SUP> = 3<HI>nv</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/16<HI>g</HI>N<HI>d</HI>; which is also = <HI>v</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/4<HI>gs</HI> by art. 8 of the general theorems in page 169; hence then 3<HI>n</HI>/4N<HI>d</HI> = 1/<HI>s,</HI> and s = N / <HI>n</HI> × 4/3 <HI>d,</HI> which is the space that would be described by the globe, while its whole motion is generated or destroyed by a constant force which is equal to the force of resistance, if no other force acted on the globe to continue its motion. And if the density of the fluid were equal to that of the globe, the resisting force is such, as, acting constantly on the globe without any other force, would generate or destroy its motion in describing the space 4/3<HI>d,</HI> by that accelerating or retarding force.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence the greatest velocity that a globe will ac∣quire by descending in a fluid, by means of its relative weight in the fluid, will be found by making the resist∣ing
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>force equal to that weight. For after the velocity is arrived at such a degree, that the resisting force is equal to the weight that urges it, it will increase no longer, and the globe will afterwards continue to descend with that velocity uniformly. Now, N and <HI>n</HI> being the separate specific gravities of the globe and fluid, N − <HI>n</HI> will be the relative gravity of the globe in the fluid, and therefore <HI>w</HI> = ⅙ <HI>pd</HI><SUP>3</SUP> (N − <HI>n</HI>) the weight by which it is urged; also <HI>m</HI> = <HI>pnv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>d</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/32<HI>g</HI> is the resistance; consequently <HI>pnv</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>d</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/32<HI>g</HI> = 1/6 <HI>pd</HI><SUP>3</SUP> (N − <HI>n</HI>) when the velocity becomes uniform; from which is found <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> for the said uniform or greatest velocity.</P>
<P>And by comparing this form with that in art. 6 of the general theorems in page 169, it will appear that its greatest velocity is equal to the velocity generated by the accelerating force <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> in describing the space 4/3 <HI>d,</HI> or equal to the velocity generated by gravity in freely de∣scribing the space <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, or the specific gravity of the globe be double that of the fluid, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> = 1 = the natural force of gravity; and then the globe will attain its greatest velocity in de∣scribing 4/3 <HI>d,</HI> or 4/3 of its diameter.—It is farther evi∣dent that if the body be very small, it will very soon acquire its greatest velocity, whatever its density may be.</P>
<P>Ex. If a leaden ball, of 1 inch diameter, descend in water, and in air of the same density as at the earth's sur∣face, the three specific gravities being as 11⅓, and 1,
<PB N="227" REF="236"/>and 3/2500. Then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> feet, is the greatest velocity per second the ball can acquire by descending in water. And <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> nearly <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> is the greatest velocity it can acquire in air.</P>
<P>But if the globe were only 1/100 of an inch diameter, the greatest velocities it could acquire, would be only 1/10 of these, namely 86/100 of a foot in water, and 26 feet nearly in air. And if the ball were still farther diminished, the greatest velocity would also be diminished, and that in the subduplicate ratio of the diameter of the ball.</P>

<HEAD>PROBLEM XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>To determine the Relations of Velocity, Space, and Time, of a Ball moving in a Fluid in which it is pro∣jected with a given Velocity.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let <HI>a</HI> = the first velocity of projection, <HI>x</HI> the space described in any time <HI>t,</HI> and <HI>v</HI> the velocity then. Now, by art. 4 of the last problem, the accelerative force <HI>f</HI> = 3<HI>nv</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/16<HI>g</HI>N<HI>d,</HI> where N is the density of the ball, <HI>n</HI> that of the fluid, and <HI>d</HI> the diameter. Therefore the general equation <HI>vv̇</HI> = 2 <HI>gfṡ</HI> becomes <HI>vv̇</HI> = −3<HI>nv</HI><SUP>2</SUP>/8N<HI>d x,</HI> and hence <HI>v̇</HI>/<HI>v</HI> = −3<HI>n</HI>/8N<HI>d ẋ</HI> = − <HI>bẋ,</HI> putting <HI>b</HI> for 3<HI>n</HI>/8N<HI>d.</HI> And the correct fluent of this is log. <HI>a</HI> − log. <HI>v</HI> or log. <HI>a</HI>/<HI>v</HI> = <HI>bx.</HI> Or, put <HI>c</HI> = 2.718281828, the number
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>whose hyp. log. is 1, then is <HI>a</HI>/<HI>v</HI> = <HI>c</HI><SUP>bx</SUP>, and the velocity <HI>v</HI> = <HI>a</HI>/<HI>c</HI><SUP>bx</SUP> = <HI>ac</HI><SUP>−bx</SUP>.</P>
<P N="2">2. The velocity <HI>v</HI> at any time being the <HI>c</HI>^-<HI>bx</HI> part of the first velocity, therefore the velocity lost in any time will be the 1 − <HI>c</HI>^-<HI>bx</HI> part, or the <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> part of the first velocity.</P>
<P>Ex. 1. If a globe be projected, with any velocity, in a medium of the same density with itself, and it describe a space equal to 3<HI>d</HI> or 3 of its diameters. Then <HI>x</HI> = 3<HI>d,</HI> and 3<HI>n</HI>/8N<HI>d</HI> = 3/8<HI>d</HI>; therefore <HI>bx</HI> = 9/8, and the velocity lost is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, or nearly ⅔ of the projectile velocity.</P>
<P>Ex. 2. If an iron ball of 2 inches diameter were pro∣jected with a velocity of 1200 feet per second, to find the velocity lost after moving through 500 feet of air; we should have <HI>d</HI> = 2/12 = ⅙, <HI>a</HI> = 1200, <HI>x</HI> = 500, N = 7⅓, <HI>n</HI> = .0012; and therefore <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> feet per second: having lost 207 feet, or nearly ⅙ of its first velocity.</P>
<P>Ex. 3. If the earth revolved about the sun in a me∣dium as dense as the atmosphere near the earth's surface; and it were required to find the quantity of motion lost in a year. Then, since the earth's mean density is about 4½,
<PB N="229" REF="238"/>and its distance from the sun 12000 of its diameters, we have 24000 × 3.1416 = 75398 diameters = <HI>x,</HI> and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; hence <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> parts are lost of the first motion in the space of a year, and only the 1/2576 part remains.</P>
<P>Ex. 4. If it be required to determine the distance moved, <HI>x,</HI> when the globe has lost any part of its motion, as suppose ½, and the density of the globe and fluid equal: The general equation gives <HI>x</HI> = 1/6 × log. <HI>a</HI>/<HI>v</HI> = 8<HI>d</HI>/3 × log. of 2 = 1.8483925<HI>d.</HI> So that the globe loses half its motion before it has described twice its diameter.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<PB N="230" REF="239"/>pass over 500 yards or 1500 feet, and what would be its velocity at the end of that time: We should have, as in ex. 2 above, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <HI>bx</HI> = 1500/2716 = 375/679; hence 1/<HI>b</HI> = 2716/1, and 1/<HI>a</HI> = 1/1200, and 1/<HI>v</HI> = <HI>c</HI><SUP>bx</SUP> / <HI>a</HI> = 1.7372/1200 = 1/690 nearly. Consequently <HI>v</HI> = 690 is the velocity, and <HI>t</HI> 1/<HI>b</HI> (1/<HI>v</HI> − 1/<HI>a</HI>) = 2716 × (1/690 − 1/1200) = 1 31/46 seconds is the time required, or 1″ and ⅔ nearly.</P>

<P>To compare this theory, contained in the last four pro∣blems, with experiment, I shall here extract the few follow∣ing numbers from extensive tables of velocities and re∣sistances, resulting from a course of many hundred very accurate experiments, made by me in the course of the year 1786; of which a particular account will be given elsewhere.</P>
<P>In the first column are contained the mean uniform or greatest velocities acquired in air, by globes, hemispheres, cylinders, and cones, all of the same diameter, and the alti∣tude
<PB N="234" REF="243"/>of the cone nearly equal to the diameter also, when urged by the several weights, expressed in avordupois ounces, and standing on the same line with the velocities, each in their proper columns. So, in the first line, the numbers shew that, when the greatest or uniform ve∣locity was accurately 3 feet per second, the bodies were urged by these weights, according as their different ends went foremost; namely, by .028oz when the vertex of the cone went foremost; by .064oz when the base of the cone went foremost; by .027oz for a whole sphere; by .045oz for a cylinder; by .051oz for the flat side of the hemisphere; and by .020oz for the round or convex side of the hemisphere. Also, at the bottom of all, are placed the mean proportions of the resistances of these figures, in the nearest whole numbers. Note, the com∣mon diameter of all the figures, was 6.375 or 6⅜ inches; so that the area of the circle of that diameter is just 32 square inches, or 2/9 of a square foot; and the altitude of the cone was 6⅝ inches. Also the diameter of the small hemisphere was 4¾ inches, and consequently the area of its base is 17¾ square inches, or ⅛ of a square foot nearly.</P>
<P>The mean height of the barometer at the times of making the experiments, was nearly 30.1 inches, and of the thermometer 62°; and consequently the weight of a cubic foot of air was equal to 1⅕ oz nearly in those circum∣stances.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>From this table of resistances, several practical in∣ferences may be drawn. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the resistance is nearly as the surface; the resistance increasing but a very little above that proportion in the greater surfaces. Thus, by comparing together the numbers in the 6th and last columns, for the bases of the two hemispheres, the areas of which are in the propor∣tion of 17¾ to 32, or as 5 to 9 very nearly; but the numbers in those two columns, expressing the resistances are nearly as 1 to 2, or as 5 to 10, as far as to the velocity
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>of 12 feet; after which the resistances on the greater surface increase gradually more and more above that pro∣portion. And the mean resistances are as 140 to 288, or as 5 to 10 2/7. This circumstance therefore agrees nearly with the theory.</P>
<P N="2">2. The resistance to the same surface, is nearly as the square of the velocity; but gradually increases more and more above that proportion as the velocity increases. This is manifest from all the columns. And therefore this circumstance also nearly agrees with the theory, in small velocities.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the hinder parts of bodies are of different forms, the resistances are different, though the fore parts be alike; owing probably to the different pressures of the air on the hinder parts. Thus, the resistance to the fore part of the cylinder is less than that on the flat base of the he∣misphere, or of the cone; because the hinder part of the cylinder is more pressed or pushed, by the following air, than those of the other two figures.</P>
<P N="4">4. The resistance on the base of the hemisphere, is to that on the convex side, nearly as 2⅖ to 1, instead of 2 to 1, as the theory assigns the proportion. And there∣fore in this particular, the theory is attended with a con∣siderable error.</P>
<P N="5">5. The resistance on the base of the cone, is to that on the vertex, nearly as 2 3/10 to 1, instead of 5¼ to 1, as the theory in pa. 223 art. 6 requires it to be. So that the theory in this instance gives less than half the true ex∣perimented resistance.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence we can find the altitude of a column of air, whose pressure shall be equal to the resistance of a body, moving through it with any velocity.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="246"/>Let <HI>a</HI> = the area of the section of the body, similar to any of those in the table, perpendicular to the di∣rection of motion; <HI>r</HI> = the resistance to the velocity in the table; and <HI>x</HI> = the altitude sought, of a column of air, whose base is <HI>a,</HI> and its pressure <HI>r.</HI> Then <HI>ax</HI> = the content of the column in feet, and 1⅕<HI>ax</HI> or 6/5<HI>ax</HI> its weight in ounces; therefore 6/5<HI>ax</HI> = <HI>r,</HI> and <HI>x</HI> = ⅚ × <HI>r</HI>/<HI>a</HI> is the altitude sought in feet, namely ⅚ of the quotient of the resistance of any body divided by its transverse section; which is a constant quantity for all similar bodies, however different in mag∣nitude, since the resistance <HI>r</HI> is as the section <HI>a,</HI> as we have found in art. 1. When <HI>a</HI> = 2/9 of a foot, as in all the figures in our table, except the small hemisphere; then <HI>x</HI> = ⅚ × <HI>r</HI>/<HI>a</HI> becomes <HI>x</HI> = 15/4 <HI>r,</HI> where <HI>r</HI> is the resistance in our table to the similar body. If, for example, we take the convex side of the large hemisphere, whose resistance is .634 oz to a velocity of 16 feet per second; then <HI>r</HI> = .634, and <HI>x</HI> = 15/4 <HI>r</HI> = 2.3775 feet, is the altitude of the column of air whose pressure is equal to the resistance on a spherical surface with a velocity of 16 feet. And to com∣pare the above altitude with that which is due to the given velocity, it will be 32<SUP>2</SUP> ∶ 16<SUP>2</SUP> ∷ 16 ∶ 4 the altitude due to the velocity 16; which is near double the altitude that is equal to the pressure. And as the altitude is proportional to the square of the velocity, therefore, in small velocities, the resistance to any spherical surface, is equal to the pressure of a column of air on its great circle, whose al∣titude is 19/32 or .594 of the altitude due to its velocity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence we may infer the great resistance suffered by military projectiles. For we find in the table that a
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>globe of 6⅜ inches diameter, which is equal to the size of an iron ball weighing 36 lb, moving with a velocity of only 16 feet per second, meets with a resistance equal to the pressure of ⅔ of an ounce weight; and therefore, com∣puting only according to the square of the velocity, the least resistance that such a ball would meet with, when moving with a velocity of 1600 feet, would be equal to the pres∣sure of 417 lb, and that independent of the pressure of the atmosphere itself on the fore part of the ball, which would be 480 lb more, as there would be no pressure from the atmosphere on the hinder part, in the case of so great a velocity as 1600 feet per second. So that the whole re∣sistance would not be less than about 900 lb to such a velocity.</P>
<P N="8">8. Having said in the last article that the pressure of the atmosphere is taken intirely off the hinder part of the ball, moving with a velocity of 1600 feet per second; which must happen when the ball moves faster than the particles of air can follow by rushing into the place quitted and left void by the ball, or when the ball moves faster than the air rushes into a vacuum from the pressure of the incumbent air. Let us therefore inquire what this ve∣locity is. Now the velocity with which any fluid issues, depends upon its altitude above the orifice, and is indeed equal to the velocity acquired by a heavy body in falling freely through that altitude. But, supposing the height of the barometer to be 30 inches or 2½ feet, the height of an uniform atmosphere, all of the same density as at the earth's surface, would be 2½ × 14 × 833⅓ or 29166 feet; therefore √16 ∶ √29166 ∷ 32 ∶ 8√29166 = 1366 feet, which is the velocity sought. And therefore with a velocity of 1600 feet per second, or any velocity above 1366 feet, the ball must continually leave a vacuum behind it, and so must sustain the whole pressure of the
<PB N="239" REF="248"/>atmosphere on its fore part, as well as the resistance arising from the vis inertia of the particles of air struck by the ball.</P>
<P N="9">9. Upon the whole we find that the resistance of the air, as determined by our experiments, differs very widely, both in respect to the quantity of it on all figures, and in respect to the proportions of it on oblique surfaces, from the same as determined by the preceding theory, which is the same as that of Sir Isaac Newton, and most modern philosophers. Neither should we succeed better if we have recourse to the theory given by professor Gravesande, or others, as similar differences and inconsistencies still occur.</P>
<P>We conclude therefore that all the theories of the resistance of the air hitherto given, are very erroneous. And I have only laid down the preceding one, till further experiments on this important subject shall enable us to deduce from them, another, that shall be more consonant to the true phenomena of nature.</P>
