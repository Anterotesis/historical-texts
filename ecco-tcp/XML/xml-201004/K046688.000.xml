<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Synopsis was originally in∣tended for private amusement, and as an Index, for the more ready turning to any particular animal in the voluminous history of quadrupeds by M. DE BUFFON: But as it swelled by degrees to a size beyond my first expectation, in the end I was determined to fling it into its present form, and to usher it into the world.</P>
<P>THE Synopsis of our illustrious countryman Mr. RAY has been long out of print; and though from his enlarged knowlege and great industry one might well suppose his Work would for some time discourage all further attempts of the same sort, yet a republica∣tion of that Synopsis would not have answered our present design: For, living at a period when the study of Natural History was but beginning to dawn in these Kingdoms, and when our contracted. Com∣merce deprived him of many lights we now enjoy, he was obliged to content himself with giving descrip∣tions of the few Animals brought over here, and col∣lecting the rest of his materials from other Writers. Yet so correct was his genius, that we view a systematic arrangement arise even from the Chaos of <HI>Aldrovandus</HI> and <HI>Gesner.</HI> Under his hand the indigested matter of these able and copious Writers assumes a new form, and the whole is made clear and perspicuous.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>FROM this period every Writer on these subjects proposed his own method as an example; some openly, but others more covertly, aiming at the honor of originality, and attempting to seek for fame in the path chalked out by Mr. RAY; but too often without acknowleging the merit of the Guide.</P>
<P>MR. KLEIN, in 1751, made his appearance as a Systematic Writer on Quadrupeds, and in his first order follows the general arrangement of Mr. RAY; but the change he has made of separating certain animals, which the last had consolidated, are exe∣cuted with great judgement. He seems less fortu∣nate in his second order; for, by a servile regard to a method taken from the number of toes, he has jumbled together most opposite animals; the <HI>Camel</HI> and the <HI>Sloth,</HI> the <HI>Mole</HI> and the <HI>Bat,</HI> the <HI>Glutton</HI> and <HI>Apes;</HI> happy only in throwing back the <HI>Walrus,</HI> the <HI>Seal,</HI> and the <HI>Manati,</HI> to the extremity of his system: I suppose, as animals nearly bordering on another class.</P>
<P>M. BRISSON, in 1756, favored the world with another system, arranging his animals by the num∣ber or defect of their teeth; beginning with those that were toothless, such as the <HI>Ant-eater,</HI> and end∣ing with those that had the greatest number, such as the <HI>Opossum.</HI> By this method, laudable as it is in many respects, it must happen unavoidably that some Quadrupeds, very distant from each other in their manners, are too closely connected in his System; a defect, which, however common, should be carefully avoided by every Naturalist.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>IN point of time, LINNAEUS ought to have the precedence; for he published his first System in 1735. This was followed by several others, vary∣ing constantly in the arrangement of the animal kingdom, even to the last edition of 1766. It is therefore difficult to defend, and still more ungrate∣full to drop any reflections on a Naturalist, to whom we are so greatly indebted. The variations in his different Systems may have arisen from the new and continual discoveries that are made in the animal kingdom; from his sincere intention of giving his Systems additional improvements, and perhaps from a failing, (unknown indeed to many of his accusers) a diffidence in the abilities he had exerted in his prior performances. But it must be allowed, that the Naturalist runs too great a hazard in imitating his <HI>present</HI> guise; for in another year he may put on a new form, and leave the complying Philosopher amazed at the metamorphosis.</P>
<P>BUT this is not my only reason for rejecting the system of this otherwise able Naturalist: There are faults in his arrangement of <HI>Mammalia</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or animals which have paps and suckle their young; in which class are comprehended not only all the genuine quadrupeds, but even the cetaceous tribe.</NOTE>, that oblige me to separate myself, in this one instance, from his crowd of votaries; but that my secession may not appear the effect of whim or envy, it is to be hoped that the following objections will have their weight.</P>
<P>I reject his first division, which he calls <HI>Primates,</HI> or Chiefs of the Creation; because my vanity will not suffer me to rank mankind with <HI>Apes, Monkies,
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Maucaucos</HI> and <HI>Bats,</HI> the companions LINNAEUS has allotted us even in this his last System.</P>
<P>THE second order of <HI>Bruta</HI> I avoid for much the same reason: The most intelligent of Quadrupeds, the half-reasoning <HI>Elephant</HI> is made to associate with the most discordant and stupid of the creation, with <HI>Sloths, Ant-eaters</HI> and <HI>Armadillos,</HI> or with <HI>Manaties</HI> and <HI>Walruses,</HI> inhabitants of another element.</P>
<P>THE third order of <HI>Ferae</HI> is not more admissible in all its articles; for it will be impossible to allow the <HI>Mole,</HI> the <HI>Shrew,</HI> and the harmless <HI>Hedge-hog,</HI> to be the companions of <HI>Lions, Wolves</HI> and <HI>Bears:</HI> We may err in our arrangement,
<Q><L>Sed non ut placidis Coeant immitia, non ut</L>
<L>Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN his arrangement of his fourth and fifth orders we quite agree, except in the single article <HI>Noctilio,</HI> a species of Bat, which happening to have only two cutting teeth in each jaw, is separated from its com∣panions and placed with squirrels, and others of that class.</P>
<P>THE sixth order is made up of animals of the hoofed tribe; but of genera so different in their na∣ture, that notwithstanding we admit them into the same division, we place them at such distances from each other, with so many intervening links and softening gradations, as will, it may be hoped, lessen the shock of seeing the <HI>Horse</HI> and the <HI>Hippopotame</HI> in the same piece. To avoid this as much as possi∣ble, we have flung the last into the back ground, where it will appear more tolerable to the Critick than if they were left in a manner conjoined.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>THE last order is that of Whales; which, it must be confessed, have, in many respects, the structure of land animals; but their want of hair and feet, their fish-like form, and their constant residence in the water, are arguments for separating them from this class, and forming them into another indepen∣dent of the rest.</P>
<P>BUT while I thus freely offer my objections against embracing this System of Quadrupeds, let me not be supposed insensible of the other merits of this great and extraordinary person: His arrange∣ment of fish, of insects, and of shells, are original and excellent; he hath, in all his classes, given phi∣losophy a new language; hath invented apt names, and taught the world a brevity, yet a fullness of description, unknown to past ages; he hath with great industry brought numbers of synonyms of every animal into one point of view; and hath given a concise account of the uses and manners of each, as far as his observation extended, or the in∣formation of a numerous train of travelling disciples could contribute: His Country may triumph in producing so vast a Genius, whose spirit invigorates science in all that chilly region, and diffuses it from thence to climates more favorable, which gratefully acknowlege the advantage of its influences.</P>
<P>LET us now turn our eyes to a Genius of another kind, to whom the History of Quadrupeds owes very considerable lights: I mean M. <HI>de Buffon,</HI> who, in the most beautifull language, and in the most agreeable manner, hath given the amplest descrip∣tions of the oeconomy of the whole four-footed
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
creation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the anatomical part in the province of M. <HI>D' Aubenton.</HI></NOTE>: Such is his eloquence, that we forget the exuberant manner he treats each subject, and the reflections he often casts on other Writers; the creation of his own gay fancy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is not advanced without reason: B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in our regard to a Gentleman whose abilities we respect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forbear producing our proofs; not doubting, but when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had time to recollect himself, he will, by a recantation of a certain g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d▪ misrepresenta∣tion, convince the Publick that his candor is not inferior to his learning and genius.</NOTE>. Having in his own mind a comprehensive view of every ani∣mal, he unfortunately seems to think it beneath him to shackle his lively spirit with systematic arrange∣ment; so that the Reader is forced to wander thro' numbers of volumes in search of any wished-for sub∣ject. The misunderstanding between these two able Naturalists is most injurious to science. The <HI>French</HI> Philosopher scarce mentions the <HI>Suede,</HI> but to treat him with contempt; <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> in return, never deigns even to quote M. <HI>de Buffon,</HI> notwithstanding he must know what ample lights he might have drawn from him.</P>
<P>I shall in a few words mention the plan that is followed in the present distribution of quadrupeds, and at the same time shall clame but a small share of originality.</P>
<P>I copy Mr. RAY, in his greater divisions of ani∣mals into <HI>hoofed,</HI> and digitated; but, after the man∣ner of Mr. KLEIN, form separate genera of the <HI>Rhi∣noceros, Hippopotame, Tapiir</HI> and <HI>Musk.</HI> The <HI>Camel</HI> being a ruminating animal, wanting the upper fore∣teeth, and having the rudiments of hoofs, is placed
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
in the first order, after the <HI>Musk,</HI> a hornless cloven-hoofed quadruped.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Apes</HI> are continued in the same rank Mr. RAY has placed them, and are followed by the <HI>Maucaucos.</HI></P>
<P>THE carnivorous animals deviate but little from his system, and are arranged according to that of LINNAEUS, after omitting the <HI>Seal, Mole, Shrew</HI> and <HI>Hedge-hog.</HI></P>
<P>The herbivorous or frugivorous quadrupeds keep here the same station that our countryman assigned them; but this class comprehends, besides the <HI>Shrew,</HI> the <HI>Mole</HI> and the <HI>Hedge-hog.</HI> The <HI>Mole</HI> is an exception to the character of this order, in re∣spect to the number of its cutting teeth; but its way of life, and its food, place it here more natu∣rally than with the <HI>Ferae,</HI> as LINNAEUS has done. These exceptions are to be met with even in the method <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as the <HI>Trichechus Rosmarus,</HI> which has four distinct grinders in every jaw, the <HI>Phoca Ursina</HI> and <HI>Leonina,</HI> the <HI>Mustela Lutris,</HI> and the <HI>Sus Hydrochaeris;</HI> and particularly in the genus of <HI>Vespertilio,</HI> which consists of numbers of species, many of which vary greatly in the number of their fore teeth.</NOTE> of that able Naturalist; nor can it be otherwise in all human systems; we are so ignorant of many of the links of the chains of beings, that to expect perfection in the arrangement of them would be the most weak presumption. We ought, therefore, to drop all thoughts of forming a system of quadrupeds from the character of a single part: but if we take combined characters of parts, man∣ners and food, we bid much fairer for producing an intelligible system, which ought to be the sum of our aim.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>THE fourth section of digitated quadrupeds con∣sists of those which are absolutely destitute of cutting teeth, such as the <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Armadillo.</HI></P>
<P>THE fifth section is formed of those which are destitute of teeth of every kind, such as the <HI>Manis</HI> and <HI>Ant-eater.</HI></P>
<P>THE third and fourth orders, or divisions, are the <HI>Pinnated</HI> and the <HI>Winged</HI> Quadrupeds; the first takes in the <HI>Walrus</HI> and the <HI>Seals,</HI> and (in confor∣mity to preceding Writers) the <HI>Manati.</HI> But those that compose this order are very imperfect: Their limbs serve rather the use of sins than legs; and their element being for the greatest part the water, they seem as the links between the quadrupeds and the cetaceous animals.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Bats</HI> again are winged quadrupeds, and form the next gradation from this to the class of Birds; and these two orders are the only additions I can boast of adding in this Work.</P>
<P>SO far of System; the rest of my plan compre∣hends numerous Synonyms of each Animal, a brief description, and as full an account of their place, manners, or uses, as could be collected from my own observations, or the information of others; from preceding Writers on the subject; from printed Voyages of the best authorities, or from living Voyagers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And it may be added, from the different <HI>Museums</HI> at home and abroad, particularly from that matchless collection in the <HI>British Museum;</HI> and, placed as it is under the direction of Gentlemen as much distinguished for their politeness as their love of science, my access to its contents, has been rendered, at all fit times, so easy, as to put this Work under singular obligations to them.</NOTE>. If it has the fortune to be any-ways
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
usefull to my Countrymen, in promoting the knowlege of Natural History, my principal object will be answered: Let it be treated with candor till something better appears; and when that time comes the Writer will chearfully resign it to ob∣livion, the common fate of antiquated Systems.</P>

<P>The several species that compose this genus, two or three excepted, inhabit the hottest part of the globe; or at lest those parts of the temperate zone that lie so near the tropics as to form a doubtfull climate.</P>
<P>None therefore, except the <HI>Saiga</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Found between the <HI>Don</HI> and <HI>Dnieper;</HI> and, as I have heard, even in <HI>Transylvania.</HI></NOTE>, are to be met with in <HI>Europe;</HI> and, notwithstanding the warmth of <HI>South America,</HI> is suited to their nature, yet not a single species has ever been discovered in any part of the new world. Their proper climates seems therefore to be those of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> where the species are very numerous.</P>
<P>As there appears a general agreement in the na∣ture of the species that form this great genus, it will prevent a needless repetition to observe here, that the ANTELOPES are animals of a most elegant and active make; of a restless and timid disposi∣tion; extremely watchfull; of great vivacity; re∣markably swift; remarkably agile; and most of their boundings so light, so elastic, as to strike the spectator with astonishment. What is very singular, they will stop in the midst of their course, for a moment gaze at their pursuers, and then resume their flight <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Shaw's trav. <HI>244.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="52"/>As the chace of these animals is a favorite diver∣sion with the <HI>eastern</HI> nations, from that may be col∣lected proofs of the rapid speed of the ANTELOPE tribe. The Grehound, the fleetest of dogs, is un∣equal in the course; and the sportsman is obliged to call in the aid of the Falcon, trained to the work, to seize on the animal and impede its mo∣tions, to give the dogs opportunity of overtaking it. In <HI>India,</HI> and in <HI>Persia,</HI> a sort of Leopard is made use of in the chace: this is an animal that takes its prey not by swiftness of foot, but by the greatness of its springs, by motions similar to that of the ANTELOPE; but should the Leopard fail in its first essay, the game escapes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bernier's trav. <HI>iv. 45.</HI> Voy. de Boullaye le Gouz. <HI>248.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

The inspired writers took their similies from such objects that were before the eyes of the people they addressed themselves to. There is another instance drawn from the same sub∣ject: the disciple raised to life at <HI>Joppa</HI> was sup∣posed to have been called <HI>Tabitha,</HI> i. e. <HI>Dorcas,</HI> or the ANTELOPE, from the beauty of her eyes; and this is still a common comparison in the <HI>East: Aine el Czazel,</HI> or "You have eyes of an ANTELOPE," is the greatest compliment that can be to paid a fine woman <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pr.

<P><PB N="24" REF="53"/>Some species of the ANTELOPES form herds of two or three thousands, while others keep in small troops of five or six. They generally reside in hilly coun∣tries; tho' some inhabit plains: they often brouze like the goat, and feed on the tender shoots of trees, which gives their flesh an excellent flavor. This is to be understood of those that are taken in the chace; for those that are fattened in houses are far less delicious. The flesh of some species are said to taste of musk, which perhaps depends on the qualities of the plants they feed on.</P>
<P>This preface was thought necessary to point out the difference in nature between this and the Goat kind, with which most of the systematic writers have classed this animal: but the ANTELOPE forms an intermediate genus, a link between the Goat and the Deer. They agree with the first, in the texture of the horns, which have a core in them: and they never cast them: with the last, in the elegance of their form, and great swiftness.</P>

they inhabit <HI>Lapland, Norway, Sueden</HI> and <HI>Russia;</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> the N. E. parts of <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>Siberia;</HI> but in each of those continents inhabit only parts, where cold reigns with the utmost rigor during part of the year.</P>
<P>They live amidst the forests for the conveniency of browzing the boughs of trees, for the great length of their legs and the shortness of their neck prevents them from grazing with any sort of ease; they often feed on water plants, which they can readily get at by wading; and <HI>M. Sarrasin</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Martyn's abridg. mem. and hist. Acad. <HI>iv. 253.</HI></NOTE> says, they are so fond of the <HI>Anagyris foetida,</HI> or stinking b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n trefoil, as to dig for it with their feet, when covered with snow.</P>
<P>They have a singular gait; their pace is a high shambling trot, but they go with vast swiftness; in old times these animals were made use of in <HI>Sueden</HI> to draw sledges; but as they were frequently acces∣sary to the escape of murderers and other crimi∣nals, the use was prohibited under great penalties. In passing thro' thick woods, they carry their heads horizontally, to prevent their horns being entan∣gled in the branches. In their common walk they raise their fore feet very high; that which I saw stepped over a rail near a yard high with great ease.</P>
<P>They are very inoffensive animals except when wounded, or in the rutting season, when they be∣come very furious, and at that time swim from isle to isle, in pursuit of the females. They strike with both horns and hoofs; are hunted in <HI>Canada</HI> during win∣ter
<PB N="44" REF="75"/>
when they sink so deep in the snow as to be∣come an easy prey: the flesh is much commended for being light and nourishing, but the nose is rec∣koned the greatest delicacy in all <HI>Canada:</HI> the tongues are excellent, and are frequently brought here from <HI>Russia:</HI> the skin makes excellent buff leather<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numbers of the <HI>American</HI> Elk skins are sent from hence to <HI>Bayonne,</HI> where they are dressed, and sold to the <HI>Gallegos,</HI> who make buff waistcoats of them.</NOTE>: <HI>Linnaeus</HI> says it will turn a musket ball: the hair which is on the neck, withers and hams, of the full grown Elk, is of great length and very elastic, is used to make matresses: the hoofs were supposed to have great virtues in curing epilepsics. It was pre∣tended, that the Elk being subject to that disease, cured itself by scratching its ear with its hoof.</P>
<P>The Elk was known to the <HI>Romans</HI> by the name of <HI>Alce</HI> and <HI>Machlis:</HI> they believed that it had no joints in its legs; and, from the great size of the upper lip, imagined it could not feed without going backward as it grazed.</P>
<P>Before I quit this subject it will be proper to take some notice of the enormous horns that are so often found fossil in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and which have always been attributed to the Moose Deer: I mean the Moose Deer of <HI>Josselyn;</HI> for no other animal could possibly be supposed to carry so gigantic a head. These horns differ very much from those of the <HI>European</HI> or <HI>American</HI> Elk; the beam, or part between the base and the palm, is vastly longer: each is fur∣nished with a large and palmated brow antler, and the snags on the upper palms are longer. The measurements of a pair of these horns are as follow:
<PB N="45" REF="76"/>
from the insertion to the tips, 5 feet 5 inches; the brow antlers 11 inches; the broadest part of the palm, 18; distance between tip and tip, 7 feet 9: but these are small in comparison of others that have been found in the same kingdom. Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> in his <HI>Louthiana, tab.</HI> xxii. Book III. gives the figure of one that was eight feet long, and fourteen be∣tween point and point. These horns are frequent in our <HI>Museums,</HI> and at gentlemen's houses in <HI>Ire∣land:</HI> but the Zoologist is still at a loss for the re∣cent animal. I have been informed by a gentleman long resident in <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> that the <HI>Indians</HI> speak of a beast of the Moose kind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called by the <HI>Indians, Waskesseu.</HI></NOTE>, but far superior in size to the common one, which they say is found 7 or 800 miles S. W. of <HI>York Fort.</HI> If such an animal exists, with horns of the dimensions just mentioned, and of proportionable dimensions in other parts, there is a chance of seeing <HI>Josselyn's</HI> account verified: for if our largest elks of seventeen hands high carry horns of scarce three feet in length, we may very well allow the animal to be thirty-three hands high which is to support horns of 3 or 400 lb. weight.</P>

among his pastoral treasures; the moderns estimate their wealth by the numbers of these useful ani∣mals; without them great part of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> would be wretched; by them the sole commerce is carried thro' arid and burning tracts, impassible but by beasts which providence formed expressly for the scorched deserts. Their soles are adapted to the sands they are to pass over, their toughness and spungy softness preventing them from cracking. Their great powers of sustaining abstinence from drinking, enables them to pass over unwatered tracts for seven or eight days without requiring the lest liquid; <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> says for fifteen. They can discover water by their scent at half a league's distance, and after a long abstinence will hasten towards it, long before their drivers perceive where it lies.</P>
<P>Their patience under hunger is such, that they will travel many days fed only with a few dates, or some small balls of bean or barley-meal; or on the miserable thorny plants they meet with in the de∣serts.</P>
<P>The largest kind will carry a load of 1000 or 1200lb. weight. They kneel down to be loaded; but rise the moment they find the burthen equal to their strength: they will not permit an ounce more to be put on: are most mild and gentle, at all times, but when they are in heat: during that pe∣riod, are seized with a sort of madness, that it is unsafe to approach them: are not prevailed on to quicken their pace by blows; but go freely if gent∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y treated, and seem enlivened by the pipe, or any

The last, which has a less bunch, and more delicate shape, and also much inferior in size, never carries burdens; but is used to ride on. In <HI>Arabia,</HI> they are trained for running matches: and in many places, for carrying couriers, who can go above 100 miles a day, on them; and that for nine days together,<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leo Afr.</HI> 338.</NOTE> over burn∣ing deserts unhabitable by any living creature.

<P>It is the camel of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili;</HI> and before the arrival of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> was the only beast of bur∣then known to the <HI>Indians.</HI> It is as mild, as gentle, and as tractable. We find, that before the intro∣duction
<PB N="65" REF="99"/>
of mules <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ovalle</HI> 44.</NOTE>, they were used by the <HI>In∣dians</HI> to plow the land; that at present they serve to carry burthens of about 100lb. that they go with great gravity, and, like their <HI>Spanish</HI> masters, no∣thing can prevale on them to change their pace. They lie down to be loaden; and when wearied, no blows can provoke them to go on. <HI>Feuillée</HI> says, they are so capricious, that if struck, they instantly squat down, and nothing but caresses can induce them to rise. When angry, have no other method of revenging injuries than by spitting, and they can ejaculate their <HI>saliva</HI> to the distance of ten paces; if it falls on the skin, it raises an itching and a reddish spot. Their flesh is eaten, and said to be as good as mutton. The wool has a strong dis∣agreeable scent. They are very sure-footed; there∣fore used to carry the <HI>Peruvian</HI> ores over the rug∣gedest hills and narrowest paths of the <HI>Andes.</HI> They inhabit that vast chain of mountains, their whole length, to the straits of <HI>Magellan;</HI> but, except where those hills approach the sea, as in <HI>Patagonia,</HI> never appear on the coasts. Like the camel, they have powers of abstaining long from drink, some∣times for four or five days: like that animal's, their food is coarse and trifling.</P>
<P>As every domestic animal has, or had its stock or origin in a wild state, we believe the <HI>Llama</HI> and the <HI>Guanaco</HI> to be the same. The <HI>Llama</HI> is de∣scribed as the largest of the two domestic animals the <HI>Peruvians</HI> have; for, except that, they knew no

<P>In a wild state they keep in great herds in the highest and steepest parts of the hills; and while they are feeding, one keeps centry on the pinnacle of some rock: if it perceives the approach of any one, it neighs; the herd takes the alarm, and goes off with incredible speed. They out-run all dogs; so there is no other way of killing them but with a gun.

a quick sense of glory. In <HI>India,</HI> they were once employed in the launching of ships: one was di∣rected to force a very large vessel into the water; the work proved superior to his strength: his mas∣ter, with a sarcastic tone, bid the keeper take away this lazy beast and bring another: the poor animal instantly repeated his efforts, fractured his scull, and died on the spot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ludolph. Com. in hist. Aethiop. <HI>147.</HI></NOTE>. In <HI>Delli,</HI> an Elephant pas∣sing along the streets, put his trunk into a taylor's shop, where several people were at work; one of them pricked the end with his needle: the beast passed on, but in the next dirty puddle filled his trunk with water, returned to the shop, and spurt∣ing every drop among the people who had offended him, spoilt their work.</P>
<P>An Elephant in <HI>Adsmeer,</HI> which often passed through the <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market, as he went by a certain herb-woman, always received from her a mouthfull of greens: at length he was seized with one of his periodical fits of rage, broke his fetters, and running through the market, put the crowd to flight; among others, this woman, who in haste, forgot a little child she had brought with her. The animal recollecting the spot where his benefactress was wont to sit, took up the infant gently in his trunk and placed it in safety on a stall before a neighboring house.</P>
<P>Another, in his madness, killed his <HI>Cornac</HI> or Go∣vernor: the wife seeing the misfortune, took her two children and flung them before the Elephant, saying, <HI>Now you have destroyed their father, you may as well put an end to their lives and mine.</HI> It in∣stantly

stopped, relented, took the greatest of the children, placed him on its neck, adopted him for its <HI>Cornac,</HI> and never afterwards would permit any body else to mount it.</P>
<P>At the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> it is customary to kill those animals, for the sake of their teeth, by the chace. Three horsemen, well-mounted and arm∣ed with launces, attack the Elephant alternately, each relieving the other as they see their companion pressed, till the beast is subdued. Three <HI>Dutchmen</HI> (brothers) who had made large fortunes by this business, de∣termined to retire to <HI>Europe,</HI> and enjoy the fruits of their labors; but resolved, before they went, to have a last chace by way of amusement: they met with their game, and began the attack in the usual manner; but unfortunately one of their horses fell down and flung its rider: the enraged animal in∣stantly seized the unhappy man with its trunk, flung him up to a vast height in the air, and received him on one of its tusks; then turning towards the two other brethren, as if it were with an aspect of revenge and insult, held out to them the impaled wretch wreathing on the bloody tooth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age de la Caille, <HI>160.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

<P>The teeth of this animal is often found in a fossil state; some years ago two great grinding teeth, and part of the tusk of an elephant were given me by some miners, who discovered them at the depth of 42 yards in a lead-mine in <HI>Flintshire;</HI> one of the strata above them was lime-stone, about 8 yards thick; the teeth were found in a bed of gravel in the same mine; the grinders were almost as perfect as if just taken from the animal; the tusk much decayed, soft, and exfoliating.</P>
<P>The grinders and tusks of the <HI>Mammouth,</HI> so often found fossil in <HI>Siberia,</HI> must be referred to this animal, as is evident from the account and figures of those in the <HI>Ph.

all other respects, those grinders resemble those of the living elephants; and one being found lodged in the skeleton of the same head with the tusks, we cannot deny our assent to the opinion of those who think them to have been once the parts of the ani∣mal we have just described.</P>
<P>These are found lodged in the sandy banks of the <HI>Siberian</HI> rivers; sometimes entire skeletons are found: the tusks are made use of as ivory, formed into combs, and used to inlay cabinets.

<P>Some of the tusks near seven feet long, one foot nine inches in circumference at the base, and one foot near the point; the cavity at the root or base nineteen inches deep: the tusks of the true ele∣phant have sometimes a very slight lateral bend, these have a larger twist or spiral curve towards the smaller end; but the great and specific difference consists in the shape of the <HI>molares</HI> or grinders, which are made like those of a carnivorous animal,

not flat and ribbed transversely on their surface life those of the recent elephant, but furnished with a double row of high and conic processes, as if in∣tended to masticate, not to grind their food.</P>
<P>A third difference is in the thigh bone: which is of a great disproportionable thickness to that of the elephant, and has also some anatomical variations.</P>
<P>The tusks have been cut and polished by the workers in ivory, who affirmed, that in texture and appearance they differed not from the true ivory: the <HI>molares</HI> were indurated to a great degree.

<P><HI>Linnaeus</HI> places this among the <HI>simiae cauda elon∣gata,</HI> and applies to it some of the synonyms of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d species: but his description agrees with this so exactly, that there can be no doubt but that it is his <HI>Simia maimon.</HI></P>
<P>This animal is well described by M. <HI>de Buffon,</HI> Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Linnaeus,</HI> and M. <HI>Brisson;</HI> and indeed every

Naturalist, except M. <HI>de Buffon,</HI> has copied <HI>Ges∣ner:</HI> but we think the first ought to have applied the name of Baboon to this species, instead of that described by him, p. 133. the one having the cha∣racter of this section, the other having a length of tail, that constitutes that of the monkey.</P>
<P>The animal called, by <HI>Barbot</HI> and <HI>Bosman</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Barbot's Guinea,</HI> 212. <HI>Bosman's Guinea,</HI> 242.</NOTE>, SMITTEN, is a large species to be referred to this genus: it is described with a great head, short tail, and of a mouse color; that it grows to the size of five feet, is very fierce, and will even attack a man.</P>
<P>The <HI>mandrill</HI> mentioned by <HI>Smith,</HI> in his voyage to <HI>Guinea,</HI> is another kind; probably only a variety of the <HI>Smitten.</HI> He says it grows to a vast size: the body as thick as that of a man: the teeth large and yellow: head vastly large: face broad and flat, wrinkled, and covered with a white skin: nose al∣ways running: body covered with long black hair like a bear. M. <HI>de Buffoon</HI> makes this last synony∣mous with his <HI>mandrill;</HI> but both the size and length of hair, and greatness of the head, shew them to be of a very different species.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tretretretre</HI> of <HI>Madagascar</HI> is another animal of this kind; described to be of the size of a calf of two years old; to have a round head, visage and ears of a man, feet of an ape, hair curled: a soli∣tary species: the natives are greatly afraid of it, and fly its haunts as it does theirs <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Flacourt hist.

<P>This animal is vulgarly called the Lion's provider, from an opinion that it rouzes the prey for that bad nosed quadruped. The fact is, every creature in the forest is set in motion by the fearfull cries of the Jackals; the Lion, and other beasts of rapine, by a sort of instinct, attend to the chase, and seize such timid animals that betake themselves to flight at the noise of this nightly pack.

<P>During summer the white bears are either resident on islands of ice, or passing from one to another: they swim admirably, and can continue that exercise <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">La Hontan, <HI>I.</HI></NOTE> six or seven leagues; and dive with great agility.

<P><PB N="194" REF="238"/>They feed on fish, seals, and the carcasses of whales; and on human bodies, which they will greedily disinter: they seem very fond of human blood; and are so fearless as to attack companies of armed men, and even to board small vessels: when on land they live on birds, and their eggs; and, al∣lured by the scent of the seals flesh, often break in∣to, and plunder the houses of the <HI>Greenlanders:</HI> their greatest enemy in the brute creation is the <HI>Morse</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Egede Greenl.</HI> 60.83.</NOTE>, with whom they have terrible conflicts, but are generally worsted, the vast teeth of the former giving it a superiority.</P>

in those early times, as far as the present resi∣dence of these <HI>Arctic</HI> animals, I will not venture to affirm, nor to deny; but since my friend, the Hon. <HI>Daines Barrington</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil.

<P>As soon as the young are brought forth, they take shelter in the pouch, or false belly, and fasten so closely to the teats, as not to be separated with∣out difficulty: they are blind, naked, and very small when new-born, and resemble <HI>foetuses:</HI> it is therefore necessary that they should continue there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they attain a perfect shape, strength, sight and hair; and are prepared to undergo what may be
<PB N="206" REF="252"/>
called a second birth: after which, they run into this pouch as into an asylum, in time of danger; and the parent carries them about with her. During the time of this second gestation, the female shews an excessive attachment to her young, and will suffer any torture rather than permit this receptacle to be opened, for she has power of opening or closing it by the assistance of some very strong muscles.</P>
<P>The flesh of the old animals is very good, like that of a sucking pig: the hair is eyed by the <HI>In∣dian</HI> women and wove into garters and girdles: the skin is very foetid.</P>

<P>"SABLE, SOBOL in <HI>Russian;</HI> ZOBEL in <HI>German:</HI> their price varies, from 1 l. to 10 l. sterling, and above: fine and middling sable skins are without bellies, and the coarse ones are with them: forty skins make a collection calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Zimmer:</HI> the finest sa∣bles are sold in pairs, perfectly similar, and are dearer than single ones of the same goodness; for the <HI>Russians</HI> want those in pairs for facing caps, cloaks, tippets, &amp;c. the blackest are reputed the best.

<PB N="222" REF="268"/>
<HI>bloomy</HI> appearance, as they express it; the old ones are said to have done <HI>blooming:</HI> the died sables al∣ways lose their gloss, become less uniform, whether the lower hairs have taken the dye or not, and com∣monly the hairs are somewhat twisted or crisped, and not so strait as in the natural ones: some fumi∣gate the skins, to make them look blacker, but the smell, and the crisped condition of the long hair, betrays the cheat; and both ways are detected, by rubbing the fur with a moist linnen cloth, which grows black in such cases."</P>
<P>"The <HI>Chinese</HI> have a way of dying the sables, so that the colour not only lasts, (which the <HI>Russian</HI> cheats cannot do) but the fur keeps its gloss, and the crisped hairs only discover it: this is the reason that all the sables, which are of the best kind, either in pairs or separate, are carried to <HI>Russia;</HI> the rest go to <HI>China:</HI> the very best sables come from the environs of <HI>Nertchitsk</HI> and <HI>Yakutsk;</HI> and in this latter district, the country about the river <HI>Ud</HI> affords sometimes sables, of whom one single fur is often sold at the rate of 60 or 70 rubles, 12 or 14 l. The <HI>bellies</HI> of sables, which are sold in pairs, are about two fingers breadth, and are tied together by forty pieces, which are sold from 1 to 2 l. sterling: tails are sold by the hundred; the very best sable furs must have their tails, but ordinary sables are often cropped, and a hundred sold from 4 to 8 l. sterling: the <HI>legs</HI> or <HI>feet</HI> of sables are seldom sold separately: white sables are rare, and no common merchandize, but bought only as curiosities: some are yellowish, and are bleached in the spring on the snow."</P>

<P><PB N="240" REF="287"/>Inhabits <HI>Poland,</HI> and the <HI>N.</HI> of <HI>Europe;</HI> and is found on the banks of all the rivers in the country <HI>N.</HI> of the <HI>Yaik;</HI> lives on fish; frogs, and water insects: its fur very valuable, next in beauty to that of the sable; caught in <HI>Bashkiria</HI> with dogs and traps: is most excessively foetid.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minx</HI> of <HI>N. America</HI> is the same animal with this. The late worthy Mr. <HI>Peter Collinson</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By letter dated <HI>June</HI> 14, 1764. <HI>Lawson</HI> also gives some account of it, p. 122, <HI>hist. Carolina:</HI> He says it is a great enemy to the Tor∣toises, whose eggs it scrapes out of the sand and devours: eats fresh water muscles, whose shells are found in great abundance at the mouth of their holes, high up in the rivers, in whose banks they live: may be made domestic: is a great destroyer of rats and mice. <HI>La Hontan.</HI> I. 232. seems to mean the same animal, by his <HI>Foutereaux,</HI> an amphibious sort of little Pole-cats.</NOTE> fa∣vored me with the following account he received from <HI>John Bartram,</HI> of <HI>Pensylvania:</HI>
<Q>The <HI>Minx,</HI> (says he) frequents the water like the Otter, and very much resembles it in shape and color, but is less; will abide longer under the water than the musk quash, musk rat, or little beaver: yet it will leave its watery haunts to come and rob our hen roosts; bites off their heads and sucks their blood: when vexed it has a strong loathsome smell: so may be called the water <HI>pole cat:</HI> its length, from nose to tail, twenty inches; the tail four: is of a fine shining dark brown color.</Q></P>
<P>From the conformity between the names this ani∣mal goes by, in <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Sueden, (Minx</HI> and <HI>Maenk</HI>) it seems as if some <HI>Suedish</HI> colonist, who had seen it in his own country, first bestowed the name it now goes by, a little changed from the original: the skins are often brought over to <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>The most industrious of animals: nothing equals the art with which they construct their dwellings. They chuse a level piece of ground with a small ri∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>let running through it. This they form into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, by making a dam across; first, by driving into the ground stakes five or six feet long, placed
<PB N="256" REF="304"/>
rows, wattling each row with pliant twigs, and fill∣ing the interstices with clay, ramming it down close The side next the water is sloped; the other per∣pendicular. The bottom is from ten to twelve fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thick; but the thickness gradually diminishes to the top, which is about two or three. The length o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these dams is sometimes not less than a hundred feet▪</P>
<P>Their houses are made in the water collected by means of the dam, and are placed near the edge of the shore. They are built on piles; are either round or oval; but the tops are vaulted; so that their in∣side resembles an oven, the top a dome. The walls are two feet thick; made of earth, stones and sticks, most artificially layed together; and the walls within as neatly plaistered as if with a trowel. In each house are two openings; one into the water, the other towards the land. The height of these houses above the water is eight feet. They often make two or three stories in each dwelling, for the convenience of change, in case of floods. Each house contains from two to thirty beavers; and the number of houses in each pond is from ten to twenty-five. Each beaver forms its bed of moss; and each family forms its magazine of winter provision, which con∣sists of bark and boughs of trees. This they lodge under water, and fetch it into their apartments as their wants require. <HI>Lawson</HI> says they are fondest of the <HI>sassafras,</HI> ash, and sweet-gum. Their sum∣mer food is leaves, fruits, and sometimes crabs and craw-fish; but they are not fond of fish.</P>
<P>To effect these works, a community of two or three hundred assembles; each bears his share in the
<PB N="257" REF="305"/>
labor: some fall by gnawing with their teeth trees of great size, to form beams or piles; others roll the pieces along to the water; others dive, and with their feet scrape holes, in order to place them in; while others exert their efforts to rear them in their proper places: another party is employed in collecting twigs, to wattle the piles with; a third, in collecting earth, stones and clay; a fourth is busied in beating and tempering the mortar; others, in carrying it on their broad tails to proper places, and with the same in∣strument ram it between the piles, or plaister the inside of their houses. A certain number of smart strokes with their tail is a signal given by the over∣feer, for repairing to such or such places, either for mending any defects, or at the approach of an ene∣my; and the whole society attend to it with the ut∣most assiduity. Their time of building is early in the summer; for in winter they never stir but to their magazines of provisions, and during that sea∣son are very fat. They breed once a year, and bring forth, the latter end of the winter, two or three young at a birth.</P>
<P>Besides these associated beavers, is another sort, which are called <HI>Terriers;</HI> which either want in∣dustry or sagacity to form houses like the others. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> burrow in the banks of rivers, making their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beneath the freezing depth of the water, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up for a great number of feet. These also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their winter stock of provision.</P>
<P>Beavers vary in their colors: the finest are black; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the general color is a chesnut brown; more or less dark: some have been found, but very rarely,

<P>Inhabits the North of <HI>Asia;</HI> but found in the greatest abundance in the forests of <HI>North America:</HI> they never run up trees except pursued, and find no other means of escaping: they burrow, and form their habitations under ground with two entrances, that they may get access to the one, in case the other is stopped up. Their retreats are formed with great skill, in form of a long gallery, with branches on each side, each of which terminates in an en∣larged chamber, as a magazine to store their winter provision in; in one they lodge the acorns, in ano∣ther the <HI>mayz,</HI> in a third the hickery nuts, and in the last, their favorite food the <HI>chinquapin</HI> chesnut. They very seldom stir out during winter, at lest as long as their provisions last; but if that fails, they will dig into cellars where apples are kept, or barns where <HI>mayz</HI> is stored, and do a great deal of mischief;
<PB N="289" REF="339"/>
but at that time the cat destroys great numbers, and is as great an enemy to them as to mice.</P>
<P>During the <HI>mayz</HI> harvest, these squirrels are very busy in biting off the ears, and filling their mouths so full with the corn, that their cheeks are quite distended. It is observable, that they give great preference to certain food; for if, after filling their mouths with rye, they happen to meet with wheat, they fling away the first, that they may indulge in the last. They are very wild, bite severely, and are scarcely ever tamed: the skins are of little use; but are sometimes brought over to line cloaks.</P>

<P>There are three marine animals, which keep a parti∣cular situation, and seem divided between the N. E. of <HI>Asia,</HI> and N. W. of <HI>America,</HI> in the narrow seas between those vast continents. These are what are called the <HI>Sea Lion</HI> and <HI>Sea Bear,</HI> and the <HI>Manati</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Sea <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear</HI> seems a local animal: the <HI>Sea Lion</HI> is not seen again nearer than the isle of <HI>Juan Fernandez,</HI> 233 deg. 40 min. south of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quator,</HI> and the <HI>Manati</HI> is quite unknown in every other part of the Pacific Ocean.</NOTE>. They inhabit, from <HI>June</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> the isles that are scattered in the seas between <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> in order to copulate, and bring forth their young in full security. The accurate and indefa∣tigable naturalist <HI>Steller</HI> was the first who gave an exact description of them; he and his companions, in the <HI>Russian</HI> expedition of 1742, were in all proba∣bility the first <HI>Europeans</HI> who gave them any distur∣bance in those their retreats. In <HI>September,</HI> these animals quit their stations, vastly emaciated; some return to the <HI>Asiatic,</HI> others to the <HI>American</HI> shores; but like the Sea Otters, are confined in those seas between lat. 50 and 56.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ursine</HI> Seal, a name we substitute for the Sea Bear, leads, during the three months in summer, a most indolent life: it arrives at the islands vastly fat; but during that time they are scarce ever in motion, confine themselves for whole weeks to one
<PB N="345" REF="400"/>
spot, sleep a great part of the time, eat nothing, and, except the employment the females have in suckling their young, are totally inactive: they live in families; each male has from eight to fifty females, whom he guards with the jealousy of an eastern monarch; and though they lie by thousands on the shores, each family keeps itself separate from the rest, and sometimes, with the young and un∣married ones, amount to a hundred and twenty. The old animals, which are destitute of females, or deserted by them, live apart, and are excessively splenetic, peevish and quarrelsome: are excessively fierce, and so attached to their old haunts, that they would die sooner than quit them. They are mon∣strously fat, and have a most hircine smell. If ano∣ther approaches their station, they are rouzed from their indolence and instantly snap at it, and a battle ensues; in the conflict, they perhaps intrude on the seat of another: this gives new cause of offence, so in the end the discord becomes universal, and is spread thro' the whole shore.</P>
<P>The other males are also very irascible: the causes of their disputes are generally these. The first and the most terrible is, when an attempt is made by another to seduce one of their mistresses, or a young female of the family. This insult produces a com∣bat, and the conqueror is immediately followed by the whole seraglio, who are sure of deserting the unhappy vanquished. The second reason of a quar∣rel is, when one invades the seat of another: the third arises from their interfering in the disputes of others. These battles are very violent; the wounds
<PB N="346" REF="401"/>
they receive are very deep, and resemble the cuts of a sabre. At the end of a fight they fling them∣selves into the sea, to wash away the blood.</P>
<P>The males are very fond of their young; but very tyrannical towards the females: if any body attempts to take their cub, the male stands on the defensive, while the female makes off with the young in her mouth; should she drop it, the former in∣stantly quits his enemy, falls on her, and beats her against the stones, till he leaves her for dead. As soon as she recovers, she comes in the most suppliant manner to the male, crawls to his feet, and washes them with her tears: he, in the mean time, stalks about in the most insulting manner; but in case the young one is carried off, he melts into the deepest affliction, and shews all signs of deep concern. It is probable that he feels his misfortune the more sensi∣sibly, as the female generally brings but one at a time; never more than two.</P>
<P>They swim very swiftly, at the rate of seven miles an hour. If wounded, will seize on the boat, and carry it along with vast impetuosity, and oftentimes fink it. They can continue a long time under wa∣ter. When they want to climb the rocks they fasten with the fore paws, and so draw themselves up. They are very tenacious of life, and will live for a fortnight after receiving such wounds as would im∣mediately destroy any other animal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCR.</NOTE>The male of this species is vastly superior in size to the female. The bodies of each are of a conic form, very thick before, and taper to the tail. The length of a large one is eight feet; the greatest cir∣cumference

five feet; near the tail, twenty inches. The weight 800 lb. The nose projects like that of a pug dog, but the head rises suddenly: nostrils oval, and divided by a <HI>septum:</HI> the lips thick; their inside red and serrated: whiskers long and white.</P>
<P>The teeth lock into each other when the mouth is closed: in the upper jaw are four cutting teeth, each bifurcated; on both sides is a small sharp ca∣nine tooth bending inwards; near that another, larger: the grinders resemble canine teeth, and are six in number in each jaw: in the lower jaw are also four cutting teeth and two canine: but only four grinders in each jaw: in all, thirty-six teeth.</P>
<P>Tongue bifid: eyes large and prominent: iris black, pupil smaragdine: the eyes may be covered at pleasure with a fleshy membrane: the ears are small, sharp-pointed; hairy without, smooth and polished within.</P>
<P>The length of the fore-legs is twenty-four inches, like those of other quadrupeds, not immersed in the body like those of seals: the feet are formed with toes as those of other animals, but are covered with a naked skin, so that externally they seem a shapeless mass, and have only the rudiments of nails to five latent toes: the hind legs are twenty-two inches long, are fixed to the body quite behind, like those of seals, but are capable of being brought forward, so that the animal makes use of them to scratch its head: these feet are divided into five toes, each divided by a great web, and are a foot broad: the tail is only two inches long.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="403"/>The hair is long and rough; beneath which is a soft down, of a bay color: on the neck of the old males the hair is erect, and a little longer than the rest. The general color of these animals is black, but the hairs of the old ones are tipt with grey. The females are cinereous. The skins of the young, cut out of the bellies of their dams, are very useful for cloathing, and cost about 3s. 4d. each; the skin of an old one, 4s.</P>
<P>The fat and flesh of the old males is very nau∣seous; but the flesh of the females resembles lamb, and the young ones roasted are as good as sucking pigs.</P>

Towards evening, both male and female swim a little way to sea, the last with the young on its back, which the male will push off, as if to teach it to swim.</P>
<P>They arrive on the breeding islands very fat and full of blood: when they are in motion they seem like a great skin full of oil, from the tremulous movement of the blubber, which has been found to be a foot thick. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> therefore call them
<PB N="350" REF="405"/>
<HI>Lobos de Aceyte</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ulloa's voy. <HI>II. 227.</HI></NOTE>, or wolves of oil. One has been known to yield a but of oil; and so full of blood, that what has run out of a single animal <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anson's voy. <HI>123.</HI></NOTE> has filled two hogsheads. The flesh is eatable; Lord <HI>Anson's</HI> people eat it under the denomination of beef, to dis∣tinguish it from that of seal, which they called lamb.</P>
<P>The old animals have a tremendous appearance, yet are excessively timid, except at the breeding season, when they seem to lose their apprehensions, and are less disturbed at the sight of man. At other times, they hurry into the water; or, if awakened out of their sleep by a loud noise, or by blows, fall into vast confusion, tumble down, and tremble in every part, thro' fear: but if once they find it im∣possible to escape <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtschatka, <HI>121.</HI></NOTE>, grow desperate, roar dreadfully, and attack their enemy with great fury. The <HI>Kamts∣chatkans</HI> either kill them in their sleep with launces, or shoot them with poisoned arrows. They cut the skin into cords, or make shoes of it: they esteem the blubber and flesh very palatable; but the feet makes a jelly, which the <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> think a great delicacy.</P>
<P>These animals associate in families like the for∣mer, but not in such great numbers: the males shew equal jealousy about their mistresses, and have bloody combats on their accounts: oftimes there is one of superior courage to the rest, and procures by dint of valour a greater number of females than

They are of a very lethargic disposition, fond of wallowing in miry places, and will lie like swine on one another, grunting like those animals, and sometimes snorting like horses in full vigor. They are very inactive on land: to prevent a surprize, each herd places a sen∣tinel, who gives certain signals of the appearance of danger: during the breeding season they <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P>They live perpetually in the water, and frequent the edges of the shores; and in calm weather swim in great droves near the mouths of rivers: in the time of flood they come so near the land that a per∣son may stroke them with his hand: if hurt, they swim out to sea; but presently return again. They live in families, one near another; each consists of a male, a female, a half-grown young one, and a very small one. The females oblige the young to swim before them, while the other old ones surround, and, as it were, guard them on all sides. The af∣fection between the male and female is very great; for if she is attacked he will defend her to the utmost, and if she is killed will follow her corps to the very shore, and swim for some days near the place it has been landed at.</P>
<P>They copulate in the spring, in the same manner as the human kind, especially in calm weather, to∣wards the evening. The female swims gently about; the male pursues; till tired with wantoning she flings herself on her back, and admits his embraces <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Leonine</HI> and <HI>Ursine</HI> seals copulate in the same manner, only, after sporting in the sea for some time, they come on shore for that purpose.</NOTE>. <HI>Stel∣ler</HI> thinks they go with young above a year: it is
<PB N="354" REF="409"/>
certain that they bring but one young at a time, which they suckle by two teats placed between the breast.</P>
<P>They are vastly voracious and gluttonous, and feed not only on the <HI>fuci</HI> that grow in the sea, but such as are flung on the edges of the shore. When they are filled they fall asleep on their backs. Du∣ring their meals, they are so intent on their food, that any one may go among them and chuse which he likes best. <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> gives an instance of one that lived in a lake of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> for five and twenty years, and was so tame as to come to the edge of the shore on being called; and would even perform the part of a ferry, and carry several people at a time on its back to the opposite shore <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As quoted by <HI>Purchas,</HI> V. 888.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Their back and their sides are generally above water, and as their skin is filled with a species of louse peculiar to them, numbers of gulls are conti∣nually perching on their backs and picking out the insects.</P>
<P>They continue in the <HI>Kamtschatkan</HI> and <HI>American</HI> seas the whole year; but in winter are very lean, so that you may count their ribs. They are taken by harpoons fastened to a strong cord, and after they are struck it requires the united force of thirty men to draw them on shore. Sometimes when they are transfixed they will lay hold of the rocks with their paws, and stick so fast as to leave the skin behind before they can be forced off. When a <HI>Manati</HI> is struck its companions swim to its assistance; some
<PB N="355" REF="410"/>
will attempt to overturn the boat by getting under it; others will press down the rope, in order to break it; and others will strike at the harpoon with their tails, with a view of getting it out, which they often succeed in. They have not any voice, but make a noise by hard breathing, like the snorting of a horse.</P>

The head, in pro∣portion to the bulk of the animal, is small, oblong, and almost square: the nostrils are filled with short bristles: the gape, or <HI>rictus,</HI> is small: the lips are double: near the junction of the two jaws the mouth is full of white tubular bristles, which serve the same use as the laminae in whales, to prevent the food running out with the water: the lips are also full of bristles, which serve instead of teeth to cut the strong roots of the sea plants, which floating ashore are a sign of the vicinity of these animals. In the mouth are no teeth, only two flat white bones, one in each jaw; one above, another below, with undulated surfaces, which serve instead of grinders.</P>

the head scarce distinguishable; and the last always hangs down: the circumference of the body near the shoulders is twelve feet, about the belly twenty, near the tail only four feet eight: the head thirty-one inches: the neck near seven feet: and from these measurements may be collected the deformity of this animal: near the shoulders are two feet, or rather sins, which are only two feet two inches long, and have neither fingers nor nails; beneath are concave, and covered with hard bristles: the tail is thick, strong, and horizontal, ending in a stiff black fin, and like, the substance of whalebone, and much split in the fore part; the end slightly divided.</P>
<P>The skin is very thick, black, and full of ine∣qualities, like the bark of oak, and so hard as scarce to be cut with an ax, and has no hair on it: be∣neath the skin is a thick blubber, which taste like oil of almonds.

It was full of frolick, and played a thousand monky tricks; sometimes swimming on one side, sometimes on the other side of the ship, looking at it with great amazement. It would come so near the ship that it might be touched with a pole; but if any body stirred, would immediately retire. It often raised one-third of its body above the water, and stand erect for a considerable time; then suddenly dart under the ship, and appear in the same attitude on the other side; and would repeat this for thirty times together. It would frequently bring up a sea plant not unlike the bottle gourd, which it would toss about and catch again in its mouth, playing numberless fantastic tricks with it.</P>
