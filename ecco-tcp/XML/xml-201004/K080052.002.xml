<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>DURHAM is a maritime county, and takes its name from the city of Durham; commonly called the bishopric, and sometimes the county palatine.</P>
<P>The description given by Camden is to the following effect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden's Brit. (Gibson's edition, 1772) vol. ii. p. 127.</NOTE>: <Q>It lies north of Yorkshire, and is shaped like a triangle <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Geographers deale with countries as astronomers with their asterismes, and fancy them into shapes; as <HI>Italy</HI> into a man's legge, <HI>Spayne</HI> into an Oxhyde, and the forme of this bishoprick into a ▵, or an equilateral triangle. It lyeth in the bosome of the Germaine Neptune, and embraced betweene the armes of the two christall rivers <HI>Teese</HI> and <HI>Derwent.</HI>—Legend of St Cuthbert.</P></NOTE>, the apex or top whereof lies to the west, being formed there by the meeting of the north boundary and the head of the river Tees: The southern side is wholly bounded by the course of the Tees: The northern side, from about the point of the angle, forms a line to the river Derwent, and then is bounded by that river</Q> (till it receives the rivu∣let called Chopwell or Milkburn), <Q>and so full north to the river Tyne: The basis of this triangle, to the east, is formed by the shore of the German ocean.</Q></P>
<P>Modern geographers have laid down the abuttals so variously, that in regard to the north-west point, we can in general only say, the river Tees totally separates the county of Durham from Westmorland and Yorkshire, and a very narrow point of Cumberland intervenes between that river and the confines of Northumber∣land, a space in which the proprietors are not well ascertained of their real boun∣daries. On the other sides, Camden's description is accurate.</P>
<P>The parts of this county, extended into the upper point or apex of the triangle, Camden describes<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camd. Brit. ibid.</NOTE> <Q>to consist of naked lands, the woods few, the hills bald, but not destitute of veins of iron ore, whilst the vallies produce plenty of grass, the English Appenines intersecting the country at this angle.</Q> At the distance of two hundred years, we cannot wonder at this picture of our county, or the igno∣rance of naturalists in regard to its produce and riches: The contrast we shall draw, it is hoped, will prove interesting. Our author then proceeds to describe the eastern side or basis of the triangle, where he observes, <Q>as well as to the south, the soil by tillage is rendered fertile, and the country enamelled with meadows, corn-fields, and pastures, and graced with many towns, the bowels of the earth abounding in coal.</Q> Such is the imperfect account given by this great wri∣ter.</P>
<P>The Magna Britannia describes this county to be thirty-five miles in length, thirty in breadth, and about one hundred and seven in circumference: Another account says, it is thirty-nine miles long, and thirty-five broad; containing nine hundred and fifty-eight square miles, and six hundred and ten thousand acres of land; and comprehending one city, eleven other market towns, fifty-two parishes,

and twenty-one chapels; two hundred and twenty-three villages, nineteen thousand nine hundred and eighty-five houses, and ninety-seven thousand inhabitants; sixteen rivers, twenty-one parks, and several castles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>The county is divided into four wards, called Easington ward, Stockton ward, Darlington ward, and Chester ward. We know no reason why the several districts took those denominations, or derived their names from places of inferior conse∣quence and distinction.</P>
<P>The air of the county is generally healthy, though cold on the hills; and accor∣ding to some authors, that of the western parts sharper than that of the east. It is well watered by rivers and brooks, the chief of which are the Tees and Were <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Hollinshed's description of these two rivers, and the several streams that join them, is so accurate, that we cannot omit the same.</P>
<P>The THESE, a river that beareth and feedeth an excellent salmon, riseth in the Black Lowes, above two miles flat west of the southerlie head of Were called <HI>Burdop,</HI> and south of the head of West Alen, and thence runneth through Tildale forest, and taking in the <HI>Langdon-water</HI> from northwdst, it runneth to Durtpit chap∣pel, to Newbiggin, and so to Middleton, receiving by west of each of these a rill comming from by north (of which the last is called <HI>Hude</HI>) and likewise the <HI>Lune</HI> afterward by southwest, that riseth at three several places, whereof the first is in the borders of Westmerland and there called <HI>Arnegill-becke,</HI> the second more southerlie named <HI>Lune-becke,</HI> and the third by south at Bandor Skarth-hill, and meeting all above Arnegill-house, they run togither in one bottome to Lathekirke-bridge, and then into the These. Having therefore met with these, it runneth to Mickleton, and there taking in the <HI>Skirkwith-water,</HI> it goeth to Rombaldkirke, crossing there also one rill and the Bander-brooke by southwest, and then going to Morewood-hag and Morewood-parke, till it come to Bernard's castell. Here also it receiveth the <HI>Thuresgill-water</HI> coming east of Rere-crosse in Yorkshire from the Spittle in Stanmore by Crag almost southwest, and being united with the These, it goeth by Stratford, Eglesdon, Rokesbie, Thorpe, Wickliffe, Ovington, Winston, and betwene Barfurth and Gain∣furth meeteth with another rill, that commeth from Langleie forest, betwene Rabie castell and Standorpe, of whose name I have no knowledge. But to proceed, the These being past Ramfurth, runneth betwene Persore and Cliffe, and in the waie to Croftsbridge taketh in the <HI>Skerne,</HI> a pretie water, which riseth above Trimdon, and goeth by Fishburne, Bradburie, Preston, Braforton, Skirmingham, the Burdons, Haughton and Darling∣ton, and there finallie meeting with the <HI>Cocke-becke</HI> or <HI>Dare,</HI> it falleth in the These beneath Stapleton before it come at Croftsbridge, and (as it should seeme) is the same which Leland calleth Gretteie or Grettie. From thence it runneth to Sockburne, nether Dunsleie, Middleton-row, Newsham, Yarne (crossing a brooke from Levenbridge) called <HI>Levin,</HI> or <HI>Leuinus</HI> in Latin, whose crinkling course is notable, and the streame of some called <HI>Thorpe.</HI> After this the These hasteth on to Barwic, Preston, Thorne abbeie, and Arsham, which standeth on the southeast side of the river almost betwene the falles of two waters, whereof one descendeth from West Hartburne, by Long Newton, Elton, and Stockton; the other from Stillington or Shillington, by Whitton, Thorpe, Blackeston, Billingham, and Norton. From Arsham finallie it goeth to Bellasis, Middleburgh, and so into the sea.</P>
<P>Ptolomie writing of the WERE, calleth it VEDRA. It riseth of three heads in Kelloppeslaw-hill, whereof the most southerlie is called <HI>Burdop,</HI> the middlemost <HI>Wallop,</HI> and the northerliest <HI>Kellop,</HI> which uniting them∣selves about St Johns chappell, or a little by west thereof, their confluence runneth through Stanhope-parke, by east Yate, and so to Frosterlie. But yer it come there, it receiveth three rilles from the north in Weredale, whereof one cometh in by Stanhope, another west of Woodcroft-hall, and the third at Frosterlie aforemen∣tioned; and a little beneath these, a fourth on the southside, which descendeth from southwest by Bolliop, Bishop-sleie, Millhouses, and Landew. Being therefore united all with the Were, this stream goeth on to Wolsingham, there taking in the <HI>Wascropburne,</HI> beside another at Bradleie, the third at Harpleie-hall (and these on the northside) and the fourth, betweene Witton and Witton castell, called <HI>Bedburne,</HI> comming by Hamsterleie, whereby this river doth now wax verie great. Going therefore from hence, it hasteth to Bishop's Akeland▪ and beneath it receiveth the <HI>Garondlesse,</HI> which riseth six miles by west of Akeland castell, and running south thereof, passeth by West-Akeland, St Helens Akeland, St Andrewes Akeland, and Bishops Akeland, and then into the Were, which goeth to Newfield and Willington. Neere unto this place also, and somewhat beneath Sunderland, the Were crosseth one brooke from southwest by Het, Coxseie, Cornefurth, Tursdale, and Croxdale, and two other from by northwest in one botome, whereof the first commeth from above Ash, by Langleie. The other, called <HI>Coue,</HI> from above Kinchleie, by Newbiggin, Lanchester, North Langley, and through Beareparke, and so meeting beneath Kelleie or Hedleie with the other, they fall both as one into the Were, betwene South Sunderland and Burnall. From hence our river goeth on to Howgh∣well, Shirkeleie, Old Duresme, and there taking in the <HI>Pidding-brooke</HI> by northeast, it goeth to Duresme, Finkeleie, Harbarhouse, Lumleie castell, (where it meeteth with the <HI>Pilis,</HI> whose heads are united betwene Pelton and Whitwell, and after called Hedleie) and from thence to Lampton. Harraton, the Beddikes, Uf∣ferton, Hilton-parke, Bishops Weremouth, and so into the sea betwene North Sunderland and North Weremouth towne, which now is called Monke Weremouth.</P></NOTE>, both abounding with fish, and particularly with trout and salmon.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="9"/>The diocese contains the whole county, and all Northumberland, except eight churches and chapels, being Hexham peculiar, which belongs to York: It has also one parish, viz. Alston-Moor in Cumberland, and claims Craike in the county of York to be under its jurisdiction.</P>
<P>It is divided into two archdeaconries, viz. DURHAM, which has the deanries of Chester, Darlington, Easington, and Stockton; and NORTHUMBERLAND, which compriseth Alnwick, Bamborough, Corbridge, Morpeth, and Newcastle deanries <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willis's Cath. vol. i. p. 221.</NOTE>.</P>

<FIGDESC>view of Durham</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> THE HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES OF THE COUNTY PALATINE OF <HI>DURHAM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE city of Durham claims our first attention. It is in Easington ward, and lies near the centre of the county, in latitude 54° 50′, and 1° 27′ west lon∣gitude from London. From whatever quarter the traveller approaches this place, he is struck with its elegant situation, and the grandeur of some of its public build∣ings. A few paces from the south road, this English Zion makes a noble appear∣ance. In the centre, the castle and cathedral crown a very lofty eminence, girt by the two streets called the Baileys, enclosed with the remains of the ancient city walls, and skirted with hanging gardens and plantations which descend to the river Were, in this point of view exhibiting the figure of a horse-shoe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This reverend aged abbey is seated in the heart of the citty, advanced upon the shoulders of an high hill, and encompassed againe with the higher hills, that he that hath seene the situation of this citty, hath seene the map of Sion, and may save a journey to the Jerusalem. Shee is girded almost rownd with the renowned river of Weer, in which, as in a glasse of crystall, shee might once have beheld the beauty, but nowe the ruine of her walls.—<BIBL>Legend of St Cuthbert.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. To form the right wing of this picturesque prospect, the banks on the opposite side of the river are high, rocky, steep, and scattered over with trees; along the brink of which the
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
street of New-Elvet is extended, and terminated by the handsome church of St Oswald: At the bottom runs Old-Elvet. Across the bridge are the streets of Claypeth and St Giles, which climb the more distant eminence, the church termi∣nating the line of buildings. The slopes of the hills are beautified with hanging gardens and rich meadows. Newton-Hall, one of the seats of Sir Henry Liddell, bart. with its adjacent plantations, fills the nearer back-ground; behind which a fine cultivated country is discovered, lengthening the prospect to the distance of ten miles, on which Penshar-Hill, with its peaked brow, is a beautiful object. To form the left wing, the banks opposite to the castle and cathedral are cloathed with wood and fruit-trees; and South-street stretches along the summit. The long canal which the river exhibits to the eye in this part, is crossed by Framwelgate bridge, of two eliptic arches. Crook-Hall, a seat of one of the family of Hopper, is seen on the river's banks, with the woodlands of Newton-Hall on the more dis∣tant ground; to the left of which the sweet villa of Francis Johnson, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> at Aykley-Heads, is seen, surrounded with irregular mounts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here, it is alledged, was a dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lical grove: The b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrow is now very conspicuous, and resembling those given by Stu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and rising plantations.</P>
<P>Approaching the city from the north, it has the most romantic and uncommon appearance: It seems to be scattered over a multitude of irregular hills, (for the ground by which it is approached is thrown up into round mounts), and we disco∣ver various parts of the town, the castle, and churches, through several vallies in one point of view, so that they appear like so many distinct places. The west front of the castle is seen on the summit of a ragged and steep rock, with some parts of the cathedral; and the street of St Giles, as if totally unconnected with the rest of the town, is spread over the brow of a distant eminence. The hollow passes amongst the hills on the north-west of the city, afford beautiful and picturesque prospects. At Castle-Chair, where the view is much confined, the castle and ca∣thedral have a noble appearance; the octagon tower of the former, with the mound on which it is placed, have a grand effect. On the eminence opposite to Shaw-Wood, the view just mentioned is enlarged; yet, the distant branches of the town being intercepted by rising grounds, leave the principal objects in the most distinct and picturesque arrangement. Approaching from the east down the street of St Giles, we command the second noblest view of the city: In front, the river Were forms a fine canal through a rich vale, crossed by Elvet bridge, of seven wet arches, and many other land arches; the town crowds the swift risings of the hill, pile upon pile; the castle and cathedral church crowning the summit of the eminence. To the left are seen the banks of Elvet and the church, flanked by a distant forest of oaks, and the groves which hang on the margin of the river: On the right is a view of Newton-Hall, and the adjacent grounds.—To this general description, more mi∣nute particulars will be added as we pass through the city.</P>
<P>A short view of historical facts relative to this place, as each circumstance arose in the respective aeras of our prelates, is given in due order in the preceding vo∣lume of this work. It is to be observed, that the first mention as to time, made by old writers of the name of Durham (or Duresme according to the language of those days) is by Hollinshed, in the reign of Athelstan, when, speaking of Sithric's

sons, Anlaf and Godred, he says, <Q>Godred with a power of men entering into Nor∣thumberland, besieged the city of Duresme, soliciting the citizens to receive him, which they would gladly have done, if they had not perceived how he was not of power able to resist the puissance of king Athelstan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hollinshed's Hist. p. 225.</NOTE>.</Q> It is evident, from cir∣cumstances, that this author adopted a wrong name for the capital of Deira; for the most approved historians concur in relating, that Godred arrived at York, where some of his partisans held the castle, but on Athelstan's approaching, Malmsbury says, it was surrendered and demolished even to the ground, and Godred, in de∣spair, took to piratical courses and a roving life at sea <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rapin, vol. i. p. 100. — Malms. p. 50.—Sax.

<P>We have not the least evidence of any town where Durham now stands, before the monks rested with the remains of St Cuthbert, after the Danish invasion. It was also remarked in the course of this work, that there is a place adjacent to the present city called Old Durham; but we have neither traces in history nor records to shew that any town existed there previous to St Cuthbert's arrival. The legendary tale, alone supported by the effigies on the north-west tower of the transept of the cathe∣dral church, (which will be described when that edifice is treated of) relates, that after the revelation or vision at <HI>Wedelau,</HI> according to Symeon's text, but <HI>Werdele</HI> by others, and described to lie east of Durham, the monks were much at a loss to find the place pointed out by the oracle, where they should rest from their labour: The name of <HI>Dunholme,</HI> then said to be given them, was not known to any. If they then lay at <HI>Warden Law,</HI> (which from much similarity of name some have conceived was the place of the vision) it was within eight miles; if on the banks of the Were, (where we shall by some observations attempt to ground a supposition that the monks halted) it was to the east of the city, at a very little distance; for that river from its source flows almost due east to Bishop-Auckland, and from thence almost due north to Old Durham. It would have been strange if <HI>Deiraham, Duresme,</HI> or <HI>Dunholme,</HI> a place named from the kingdom of Deira in which it was situated, or some such memorable distinction, had then stood on the scite of Old Durham, and was not known to the inhabitants within so small a distance as Chester, the last residence of the monks. The discovery of the place of their destination occurred to the wander∣ers accidentally, as the legend relates; for whilst they travelled through the country with uncertain steps, a woman, seeking her cow, was informed by a person she met that she would find it in <HI>Dunholme:</HI> The astonished monks rejoiced at the propitious voice, and followed their fortunate guide, where indeed they found a country flow∣ing with milk and honey. So much for the legend; which we would not have troubled the reader with, but it leads to an argument, that the effigies on the church were placed there in commemoration of the happy possession of the rich meads and vallies on the Were, which could not be more aptly expressed in emblem than by the figure of the bountiful cow distending her udder to dispense charitable gifts to mankind: It was emblematical of the rich country they had obtained, of the gra∣cious gifts of Providence decreed to them, and the holy benevolence of the church. In pursuance of this idea, it is probable the monks, on discovering their destin∣ed residence with the pious host which accompanied them, sat down on the plains
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
south-east of the present city, by the brink of the river; and there erected them∣selves habitations, till they could build a church wherein to deposite the saint's re∣mains: This conjecture has a strict correspondence, not only with the name of <HI>Old Durham,</HI> but of the <HI>Burgus vetus,</HI> (which we shall point out from several records) afterwards granted to the convent. On the one side of this plain was a fortress, perhaps of no less antiquity than the times we are speaking of, called the <HI>Maiden Castle,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Gentleman's Magazine for the year 1755, the origin of the name <HI>Maiden,</HI> when annexed to <HI>Way</HI> or <HI>Castle,</HI> is learnedly defined by that great antiquary Mr Pegge, under his then signature of Gemsege: Par∣ticularly he says, <Q>To risque a conjecture upon a point so obscure, perhaps it may come from the British word MAD. <HI>pulcher</HI> or <HI>beautiful;</HI> hence possibly may come the Anglo-Saxon word MAID and MAIDEN, <HI>virgo,</HI> which in that case answers exactly to our present expressions <HI>a fair one,</HI> and in the plural <HI>the fair;</HI> a sense undoubtedly very well accommodated to all the three names of <HI>Maiden-Castle, Maiden-Way,</HI> and <HI>Maiden-Hold.</HI></Q></P></NOTE> the remains of which are described in the sequel; and on the other side, a peel or castle, as is presumed from the name of the eminence called the Peel-Law or Castle-Hill, though no traces of any such erection are at this time to be seen or found in the forest of oak that grows on the hill. The river runs be∣tween the eminences, and almost fills the whole intervening space. The remains of extensive breastworks and trenches are to be seen a little farther up the vale, such as the people of that age used to cast up for the defence of their habitations; and not far distant is an eminence called <HI>Mont-Joye,</HI> from whence the wanderers obtained a view of the Hill of Zion, whereon St Cuthbert was to rest for ever.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr Cade of Durham, in his tract on the Roman roads of this county, published in the Archaeologia, vol. vii. p. 74, has taken great pains to trace the works, and entertains an idea that they were the vestiges of a Roman winter-camp.—For the satisfaction of our readers, we shall extract his letter on the subject when we describe those places.</NOTE> <HI>Warden-Law</HI> lies several points to the north-east of the city of Durham, and on the wrong side of the river for the monks to approach Chester from Ripon. The fords are dangerous and uncertain, and even impassable at certain seasons by tra∣vellers on foot: Warden-Law is also at a greater distance from Ripon by eight miles than Durham. Such circumstances counterpoise the apparent similarity of names, and induce a belief, that as the religious troop would cross the river Tees either at Neseham, Croft, or Piercebridge, they would seek the fordable passes of the river Were near Durham; and that <HI>Wedelau, Werdale,</HI> and such other names as we find in ancient authors, express the <HI>Dale of Were.</HI> Though names grow corrupt, yet points of the compass must remain; and if the pious host sat down east of Durham, on the banks of the Were, there was no other ground so situated but in the vicinity of Old Durham. This argument shall not be pressed further till we come to describe the ground, in our progress through the county.</P>
<P><HI>Dunholme,</HI> or the eminence on which St Cuthbert was to rest, is described to us as being insufficient for the reception of the multitude that attended the saint, till they had cut down the thickets and forests which grew upon the skirts of the hill. The first work the pious labourers engaged in, was to erect an ark or tabernacle with timber and boughs of trees, where they deposited the saint's body; after which they built a compleat edifice, similar to the churches of that age, which was called the <HI>White Church.</HI> This transaction all the monkish writers fix to the

year 995 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The learned editor of Camden adds, <Q>And to omit the many pretended miracles, and other passages of less moment, he (Symeon) says further, that the first church erected at Dunholm by bishop Aldwin was, <HI>facta citissime de virgis ecclesiola,</HI> "a little church quickly made of rods;" just such another struc∣ture as that which is said to have been first built at Glastenbury, whereof Sir Henry Spelman has given us a draught:</Q> <HI>Qui locus non erat inhabitatus vel aedisicatus, sed densissima undiq. sylva totum occupavit.</HI>—<BIBL>Elenchus Liber, cui tit. Liber Ruber Dun.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. It doth not appear that any habitations were erected for the people on the mount where the church was built, for a considerable time after their com∣ing to Dunholme; for we are told, in the course of three years from the date of the first tabernacle, that a church of stone-work was begun and dedicated by bishop Aldun, wherein the saint's remains were deposited. According to the course of events exhibited by the ancient writers, it was not till after the foundation of Al∣dun's church was laid; that the forest which grew round the eminence was cut down, and the skirts of the hill were rendered sit for human habitation. Much labour was expended; and all the inhabitants between Coquet and Tees rivers, at the command of the earl of Northumberland, are said to have been employed there∣in; workmen drawn from a tract of country not less than fifty miles in length: Such was the mighty concourse which on that occasion crowded the banks of the Were <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The topography of <HI>Dunholme</HI> at that tyme was, that it was more beholding to nature for fortification than fertilitie; where thick woods both hindred the starres from viewing the earth, and the earth from the prospect of heaven. Here the monkes, with extemporary devotion, instead of a church, built an arbour of boughs for <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> and from thence translated it into <HI>Whitkyrk</HI> (for three years); while <HI>Aldwinus</HI> the bishop raised no small building of stone worke for his cathedral church, where all the people betweene <HI>Co∣qued</HI> and <HI>Tees</HI> three years were at worke, and were paid for their paynes with treasure in heaven, than which there was never a dearer or cheaper way to build churches. Into this new <HI>basilica, St. Cuthbert's</HI> restless body, in the three hundred and ninth yeare after his first buriall, was with all funeral pompe enshrin'd.—<BIBL>Legend of St Cuthbert.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. From the above circumstances we are led to date the rise of the town of Durham in the opening of the eleventh century. Bishop Aldun did not live to see his design compleated, but left the western part of the edifice, after eighteen years pious care, for his successors to finish.</P>
<P>We hear nothing further of the town of Durham till the year 1040, when, some authors say, it was attacked by Duncan of Scotland; and it seems there were then fortifications, for the townsmen, as reported, sustained the invaders assaults for a long time, and at length made a victorious sally, whereby the enemy were totally routed. The heads of such Scots leaders as fell or were taken prisoners, were six∣ed on poles round the market-place. The eminence chosen for the first build∣ings was so steep on every side but one, that it was easily defended against the at∣tacks of an enemy: The weakest part was on the north-east, where Claypeth, or Clayport-gate, now stands, being on the neck of land between the streams of the river: This neck, from brink to brink of the Were, is not much above 200 paces in width in its present state; and there are sufficient appearances on the adjacent ground to encourage a conjecture, that a sluice or moat crossed this narrow part, whereby the whole city could on occasion be compleatly insulated. The name of <HI>Clayport,</HI> as it is stiled in all the ancient writers, appears to be a corruption of <HI>Cluer∣port,</HI> or the gate of the sluice; <HI>cleur</HI> being a north-country word, in acceptation for a sluice-gate or sluice-board, by which a dam-head is stopped. Leland, who visited this country, in his Itinerary says <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in. vol. i. p. 81.</NOTE>, <Q>The towne self of Duresme stondith on a
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
rocky hille: and stondith as men cum from the south cuntre on the ripe of Were, the which water so with his course naturall in a botom windith about, that from Elvet a greate stone bridge of 14 arches, it crepith about the towne to Framagate bridge of 3 arches also on Were, that betwixt thes 2 bridges, or a little lower at St Nicholas, the towne, except the lenght of an arrowshot, is brought <HI>in insulam;</HI> and some hold opinion, that of auncient tyme, Were ran from the place wher now Elvet bridge is, straite down by St Nicholas, now stond∣ing on a hille; and that the other course, part for pollicy, and part by digging of stones for building of the towne and minstre, was made a valley, and so the wa∣ter course was conveyid that way, but I approve not full this conjecture.</Q> Leland, doubting the truth of the report, does not express his opinion concerning the neck of land which he mentions. Symeon, who gives us the account of the before-mentioned attack on Durham, takes no notice of any fort or strong-hold which contributed to the gallant defence of the inhabitants; but it is probable the mound on which the octagonal tower of the castle stands, was cotemporary with the church, and perhaps formed of the soil, which was necessarily moved when the foundations of that structure were laid. At Warwick there is a mound of the same form, with terraces similar to those at Durham; and Dugdale <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warwickshire, p. 308.</NOTE> tells us, <Q>If it was presumption to carry its antiquity higher, to refer the foundation thereof to the renowned lady Ethelstede, daughter of king Alfred, and lady of the Mercians, I am sure will not, in regard it appears, that she in 915 (scil. in the 16th year of king Edward the Elder) caused the dungeon to be made, which is a strong tower or platform, upon a large and high mount of earth, artificially raised (such being usually placed towards the side of a castle or fort, which is least defensible) the substance whereof is yet to be seen.</Q> This passage is quoted, to shew the reader there was an example for the people to follow, and that such mounts were of that antiquity. It is said to be the opinion of the ingenious Mr Wright, of Byers-green<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Author of Louthiania.</NOTE>, that this was a Danish mount or fort; but we have no traces in history of that peo∣ple having a residence here; and indeed the former arguments hold against it, as such a work would have rendered the place notorious to the monks of Chester, at the distance of six miles.</P>
<P>The next event noted in history, wherein Durham is distinguished, was in the year 1069, after the coming in of William the Norman, when he sent down Cu∣min as governor of Northumberland with a guard of 700 veteran Norman soldiers. Despising bishop Egelwin's caution and advice, Cumin entered the city with marks of cruelty and tyranny, and through the insolence of his own self-sufficiency, per∣mitted his troops to give themselves up to rioting and wantonness; they forcibly took possession of the houses, were dispersed through every quarter of the city, and committed various enormities against the inhabitants. The Normans, overcome with drunkenness and revelling, were totally off their guard; whilst the people of the adjacent country, arming themselves, assembled in the night, and at the dawn of day forced the gates of the city, fell upon the Normans when they sus∣pected no violence, and put them to the sword; so that the streets were filled with blood and carcases, the house where the earl lodged was set on fire, and those within endeavouring to fly were immediately slain, only one wounded person
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
of the whole band escaping death. When the ruthless tyrant William, greedy of revenge, marched his army northward, the affrighted inhabitants of Durham fled the city <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camd. Brit.</NOTE>; and the monks forsook their convent, leaving the Normans a melancholy solitude, on which to wreak their vengeance by fire and destruction. As soon as the troops retired, the inhabitants came from their hiding places, and the religious host brought back their holy charge after an absence of four months.</P>
<P>The king having appointed Walcher to the bishopric, on his return from an ex∣pedition against Malcolm of Scotland in 1072, ordered a castle or fortress to be built at Durham, at once to protect the bishop and his convent, to keep the peo∣ple in subjection, and to awe the northern territories, this place being esteemed a fit situation for a barrier. It is certain such an edifice was begun about that period of time; but we have no information of what form it was, though the oc∣tagonal figure is not unusual in the Norman buildings. It seems, Camden appre∣hended the castle directed to be built by William was not founded on the scite of any ancient fortress, his words being <HI>in eminentiori collis parte extruxit;</HI> but that a more elevated situation was chosen for the new bulwark than the stronghold al∣luded to by Gulielmus Gemiticencis, whose words he quotes, describing the for∣tress: <Q>From whence (he says) the English, dissatisfied with the Norman yoke, made frequent sallies, and kept themselves close there, waiting for the expected approach of the Danes; that it was in a part of the country inaccessible by reason of woods and waters; that it had a strong rampier round it, which they called Dunholme.</Q> This account seems to strengthen the former arguments. William de Malmsbury, whom Camden quotes, and who lived about that time, gives us this description of the city: <Q>Durham is a hill rising gradually from out the valley to its summit; and notwithstanding, by its rugged situation and bro∣ken rocks, all access for an enemy is cut off, yet lately they have built a castle upon a hill, at whose foot runs an excellent river.</Q> Dugdale, further speaking of the castle of Warwick, says, <Q>In those days (in the Saxons time I mean) were very few such defensible places as we now call castles, that being a French name; so that though the English were a bold and warlike people, yet, for want of the like strongholds, were they much less able to resist their enemies, which defect gave great advantage to the Norman conqueror after his victory at Hast∣ings; whereof he was so sensible, that he neglected not to raise store of such forts through the whole realm, as I have elsewhere observed, amongst which this at Warwick was not the least.</Q></P>
<P>Bishop Walcher's assumption of the civil jurisdiction, in the character of pala∣tine, it is apprehended brought on the tragical catastrophe before related <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See vol. i. p. 130.</NOTE>, in the month of May, 1080; and the city of Durham, after his death, sustained the assault of the rioters for four days, who, not able to make any impression, dispersed themselves.</P>
<P>William de Carilepho, who succeeded in the bishopric, was among the malecon∣tents on the accession of William Rufus: After the king had quelled the southern
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
insurrections, he sent an army into the north, which laid siege to Durham, and soon reduced the place; the bishop flying into Normandy: On this occasion, the temporalties of the See were seized into the hands of the crown, John de Tailbois and Ernesius de Burone were made governors of the castle and palatinate, and it was not till the year 1091 that the bishop was restored: Soon after that event, he granted, or (if the ancient authorities are not confused on this subject) rather re∣granted to the convent, Elvet in the order of a borough, where the monks should have forty merchants houses or tradesmen's shops, distinct and separate from the bi∣shop's borough of Durham, that they might trade there, freed from duties payable to the bishop and his successors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Linwood, upon the Provincial, <HI>(ut singula de sensibus)</HI> speaks to this effect: <HI>Aliqui interpretantur Bur∣gum esse Cast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, vel locum ubi sunt crebra cast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a: vel dicitur Burgus, ubi sunt per limites habitucula plura con∣stituta.</HI> But afterwards defines it thus: <HI>Burgus dici potest villa quoecunq. alia in civitate, in qua est universitas approbata.</HI>—Some derive it from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. <HI>Turris.</HI> See Skene <HI>De Verb Signif.</HI>—Verstegan, in his <HI>Restitution of decayed Intelligence,</HI> saith, <HI>Burg</HI> or <HI>Burgh,</HI> whereof we take our <HI>Borough,</HI> metaphorically signifies a town having a wall or some kind of a closure about it: All places that in old time had amongst our ancestors the name of <HI>Borough,</HI> were one way or other fenced or fortified.—It is doubtful, whether, before the statute of Acton Burnell, goods were devisable but in ancient <HI>Boroughs,</HI> where by prescriptive custom they were usually devised.</P></NOTE>. Though we have no previous account of the borough of Durham, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 134.</NOTE> yet by inference we may determine that such borough ex∣isted, with exclusive privileges, even till the institution of the borough of Elvet held an entire trade: How this diminution was relished, we are not informed; nor how the new borough supported its authority.</P>
<P>In the time of bishop Flambard <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bishop Flambard was consecrated A. D. 1099, and died 1128.</NOTE>, whilst the temporalties were in the hands of the crown, it appears by the guardians accounts, the borough of Durham sustain∣ed considerable damage by fire <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 147.</NOTE>. After the bishop's restoration to the See, he improved the fortifications of the city, by extending the walls between the church and the castle: He removed all the houses on the area between those two edifices, and levelled the ground: He fortified the castle with a moat, strengthened the banks of the river, and built the beautiful bridge called Framwellgate-bridge.</P>
<P>In April 1139, this city entertained the members of congress, when articles of peace were agreed upon; Maud queen of England, with a great number of barons, on the part of that crown, and prince Henry, with many Scotch nobles, on the other part, being present.</P>
<P>King Henry II. during his displeasure with bishop Pudsey, took possession of the castle and city of Durham, and on various pretexts repeatedly deprived him of the custody of this strong place. It was a custom for the burgesses, on the demise of a prelate, to deposite the keys of the city gates at the shrine of St Cuthbert: On the death of bishop Pudsey, the officers of the crown, who had seized the temporal∣ties, took violent possession of the keys contrary to the ancient usage. As the election of a prelate was studiously delayed, and much oppression happened during the vacancy of the See, under the influence of the crown officers, and as a creature of the king succeeded, it is not to be wondered that we hear no further than the mere mention of this infringement of the privilege of the convent.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="19"/>King Henry III. on his northern excursion, honoured this city with his residence for some short time, during the episcopacy of bishop Farnham.</P>
<P>After the victory of Falkirk, Edward I. halted at Durham, to which place intelli∣gence was brought that the Scots again appeared in force, which obliged the king to march nothward, and he celebrated the festival of Christmas at Tynemouth. In the year 1300, the king was again at Durham, as a mediator between the bishop and his convent, touching their then bitter dissentions.</P>
<P>On Brus's incursion in the time of Edward II. a party of the Scotch, whilst the inhabitants were in their beds, surprised the suburbs of Durham, which they re∣duced to ashes.</P>
<P>Edward III. with a great army, was at Durham for some time, before the Scotch were discovered to lie in Stanhope-park: In 1333 he was again at Durham, on his march northward, previous to the victory of Hallidown-hill.</P>
<P>The walls of the city of Durham having been neglected, and becoming ruinous, were restored and put into a state of defence by bishop Beaumont, who in 1323 re∣ceived a severe censure from Edward II. for his negligence in matters so important to his palatinate. On the 23d of December, 1356, Edward III. was at Durham, and issued summonses for the military tenants to attend him on a northern expedition, in which Berwick was besieged and reduced.</P>
<P>In 1424 this city was crowded with the nobility of England and Scotland, on the liberation of the Scotch king, and his marriage with the lady Jane Seymour; the hostages were received here; a truce for seven years was also then settled be∣tween the two nations; and certain laws established for the government of the bor∣ders: The king and queen of Scotland remained at Durham a considerable time, not departing thence until the last day of March or first of April.</P>
<P>A dreadful visitation of the plague happened here in the time of bishop Langley, which occasioned an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note to vol. i. p. 271.</NOTE> adjournment of the assizes, and a total suspension of all public assemblies in the year 1416: It continued to rage for five successive years.</P>
<P>In the time of bishop Nevill, this city was the place of many conventions of the delegates of England and Scotland. In 1448, Henry VI. came here on a Pilgrim∣age to the shrine of St Cuthbert. In 1463, lord Montague was at Durham with his army, previous to the battle of Hedgley-Moor.</P>

<P>Durham was the scene of a bloody execution on the suppression of Nevill's rebel∣lion, no less than sixty-six persons suffering death there. In the year 1589 the plague again broke out and raged in Durham for a considerable time: After abat∣ing for some months, which gave hopes that the tremendous visitation was about to cease, it appeared again in 1597 with redoubled violence, so as to oblige the poorer people to be removed into huts and sheds on the adjacent commons, parti∣cularly Elvet-Moor, where the marks of arrangement of melancholy cells were dis∣tinctly to be observed, before the late inclosures, on the south side of the hill, be∣low the wood. An idea may be formed of the miserable situation of these unhappy people from the account (in the Annals <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 1139.</NOTE> of bishop Morton) of the wretched sufferers on Hob-Moor near York: His benevolence, it is to be hoped, was not unrivalled by the ecclesiastics of our city.

<P><PB N="13" REF="23"/>We are totally ignorant what privileges this place anciently enjoyed as a borough. The munificent prelate, Hugh Pudsey, after the disputes with his sovereign subsided, granted a written charter to the burgesses of Durham, which was the first charter the borough received: The people of Durham are therein stiled burgesses, we pre∣sume, from their inhabiting within the gates of a walled town, and under the pro∣tection of a fortress, where they carried on a secure trade, and perhaps held certain customs established by successive prelates. By this charter, of which the plate is a <HI>fac-simile,</HI> the people were for ever thereafter discharged from the customs of in-toll and out-toll for all their merchandizes; they were also exempted from he∣riots, a duty or tribute established in very distant antiquity, and in the Saxon times given to the lord for his better maintenance in war. Most of the ancient writers have distinguished heriots in two branches, heriot custom and heriot service: Law definitions have little right to a place here; it must suffice to say, that both de∣nominate an estate of inheritance, and the heriot service a fee-simple. But the fourth exemption by this charter is most singular; it is a discharge from the cus∣tom of <HI>marchet:</HI> This was the old borough custom <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Marchet—turpis Scotorum veterum consuetudo, qua territorii dominus vassalli sponsam prima nocte comprimeret, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lorem{que} carperet pudicitiae.—Spelman's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loss. p. 397.</P>

<P>The plate of bishop Pudsey's charter, with the confirmation by pope Alexander III. was given to this work by Mr George Allan. When this was engraved, the originals were in the hands of Christ. Fawcett, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Newcastle, who lent them to Mr Allan to copy, and have since been delivered up to the corporation.</P>
<P>Pope Alexander III. was elected 6th Sept. 1159, and died in 1181, having reigned 21 years, 11 month and 22 days.</P>
<P>The seal to the confirmation is of lead, appendant by a yellow and crimson silk string. Popes bulls are public writings, issued from the Roman Chancery, commonly sealed with lead, and are the same with edic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, letters patent, and provisions of secular princes: If they are letters of grace and favour, the lead is hung on silk thread; if they be of justice, and executory, the lead is hung by an hempen cord.

<P>There are a great many in the Chapter-house at Durham, particularly one of pope Clement VII. A. D. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>24. with the seal of solid gold, confirming the title of <HI>sidei defensor</HI> to Hen. VIII.</P>
<P>Collier, in his Geographical Dictionary, says, "The council held at Lateran was on the 5th of March, 1179. where pope Alexander III. was assisted by 300 bishops."</P></NOTE>, and brings ludicrous ideas, when one considers it had relation to a prelate's borough. When the barbarous customs of our ancestors began to be corrected through the medium of more po∣lished manners, and learning had diffused a liberality of sentiment, this brutal and

absurd mark of the vilest vassalage was commuted for a money payment. In vari∣ous parts of this island the custom bore different names; in some places the <HI>marchet,</HI> in others <HI>maiden-rents,</HI> and in Wales <HI>gwabr-marched;</HI> all distinguishing a mulct paid to the lord for the marriage of a vassal's daughter, and originally commuted for his right with the virgin bride. The additional bounty to the borough, which has reference to the free customs of Newcastle, may not be so easily explained, no historian having hitherto informed us what were the original privileges of Newcastle, or by whom they were granted. If in the laborious researches of the reverend Mr Brand this may be discovered, it will add new light to the history of our city, whose burgesses, by this grant, were entitled to hold all such free customs as the burgesses of Newcastle enjoyed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Joh'es Dei gra. &amp;c: Sciatis nos concessisse et hac carta n'ra confirmasse burgensibus n'ris de Novo Castro sup.

<PB N="23" REF="33"/></NOTE> was much more ample than the preceding one: It opens with this preamble: <Q>Tobias, by the grace of God, bishop of Durham.
<PB N="24" REF="34"/>
Whereas the city of Durham in the county palatine of Durham is, and time out of mind hath been, an ancient city, of good fame. And the burgesses, men
<PB N="25" REF="35"/>
and inhabitants of the said city, together with those of Framwelgate, have had and enjoyed divers rights, jurisdictions, liberties, and privileges, as well by pre∣scription
<PB N="26" REF="36"/>
as by virtue of divers charters, grants, and confirmations, as well from us, as several of our predecessors, bishops of Durham. And the bur∣gesses,
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>
men and inhabitants in time past, have suffered great damage, by reason of the defect of some of the said charters; and fearing lest in time to come they
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>
should be molested in the enjoyment of such their liberties and free customs, for want of publication, and other causes; they have therefore humbly entreated us to express, in special words, what the said liberties and free customs are, and to grant the same to the said burgesses and inhabitants and their successors, and to incorporate them,</Q> &amp;c. By this charter he constituted and granted, that the burgesses and inhabitants should be one body politic and corporate, consisting of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and commonalty, to continue for ever, by the name of
<PB N="29" REF="39"/>
mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of Durham and Framwelgate, and by that title to plead and be impleaded in all courts of law within the county, with power to purchase lands not exceeding the yearly value of 100 marks, and to have a common seal. Hugh Wright was therein appointed the first mayor, to con∣tinue in office till the 4th day of October then next following, and then to be an alderman for life, to supply the number of twelve without any new election. Robt Sureties, Rich. Hutchinson, Edw. Wanles, Wm Hall, Ja. Farales, Tho. Pearson, John Wall, Edw. Taylor, Hugh Hutchinson, John Heighington, John Pattinson, and Richard Wright, were appointed aldermen for life. They were directed to chuse yearly twenty-four discreet men out of their several twelve arts, mysteries, or trades, that is to say, two out of the mercers, grocers, haberdashers, ironmongers, and salters; two of the drapers and taylors, two of the skinners and glovers, two of the tanners, two of the weavers, two of the dyers and fullers, two of the cordwainers, two of the saddlers, two of the butchers, two of the smiths, two of the carpenters and joiners, two of the free masons and rough masons, inhabitants of the city and Framwelgate, which, with the mayor and aldermen, should form a common council for the said city, and, on the 4th day of October yearly, to chuse a mayor out of the body of the said aldermen, it being requisite to have seven aldermen in the majority of votes on that occasion, with a power for a like majority to deprive or suspend the mayor for any offence committed in his office; and on such occasion, or on the death of the mayor, another chief magistrate should be in like manner elected, with∣in eleven days from the time of such deprivation, to supply that year; and within three days after such election, to be sworn before the bishop for the time being, or, on the See being vacant, or the bishop being in distant parts, then before the chan∣cellor of the county palatine, or, on his absence out of the jurisdiction, before the aldermen and the twenty-four common-councilmen, or the major part of them. On the fifth day of October, yearly, the said mayor, aldermen, and common coun∣cil are directed to chuse two serjeants. On the death of a common councilman, the mayor and aldermen, within twenty days, are to nominate one in his stead, out of the same trade; and on the vacancy of an alderman within the same time, to nominate another out of the burgesses and inhabitants of the said city and Fram∣welgate. Any person elected mayor or alderman, and refusing to take upon him the office, is made subject to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, to be levied on the desaulter's goods and chattles, or committed to the gaol at Durham till the same is paid; and such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines to be applied to the public use of the city. They were also authorized to make laws, statutes, and ordinances, for the better govern∣ment of the city, and the markets and fairs therein, and all officers, mysteries, arti∣ficers and inhabitants, and for regulating their several trades and mysteries; and the due preservation and management of the lands and possessions of the said body corporate. And for the better maintenance, state, and dignity of the said mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, the same charter grants them all courts, fairs, markets, tolls, perquisites, stallages, pontages, passages, customs, and all and singular liber∣ties, franchises, profits, commodities, emoluments, and free customs, which at any time before the date thereof the burgesses had enjoyed, or the bailiffs or aldermen
<PB N="30" REF="40"/>
of the city had held and used, by virtue of any preceding charter, or by means of any custom or prescriptive right whatsoever; and that the said mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, and their successors, should hold their court within the city, from fifteen days to fifteen days for ever, and therein, before their steward, to hear and determine all actions, suits, quarrels, and demands, which might arise within the said city and Framwelgate; the serjeants having power to serve process, and enter into the lands, possessions, or shops of the parties, to satisfy the executions or judg∣ments of the said court, or to attach their bodies and commit them to prison: They were also empowered to take cognizance of all pleas, as well real as personal or mixed in the said court, and have equal authority within their precincts as any other courts of the county palatine of Durham had. The steward was also autho∣rised to punish the officers and ministers of the court by fine or imprisonment; and all such fines and profits were granted to the said mayor, aldermen, and commonal∣ty; with view of frank-pledge, to be holden by their steward within the precincts of the city twice a year, within a month after Michaelmas and Easter; with power of settling the assize of bread and corn unground, and all other things for sale; and, in their leet, to punish offences; and the profits of such courts were also thereby granted to them. Also a market weekly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Die Sabbathi.</NOTE> on Saturday, and three yearly fairs on the days appointed by bishop Pilkington's charter <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See p. 29.</NOTE>, with the profits and perquisites thereof; and every mayor for the time being was made clerk of the market, to en∣joy the profits thereof.</P>
<P>This charter received royal confirmation by letters patent dated at Westminster the 14th day of February 1605, though it is apprehended, the bishop was competent to make his charter without the aid of the crown, and therefore this badge of honour, after the gilding of its dignity was removed, was no better than a scab on the con∣stitution and privileges of the palatinate.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the preceding charters, the bishops and their officers or lessees continued to take the tolls and dues of goods coming into the markets within the borough, and to appoint a bailliff of the borough, and clerk of the market.

The defendants alledged, that the corn of which the toll was demanded, was not sold in the market, but by private contract, and delivered at the buyer's house, who lived in the limits of the borough. The following decree was made: "It appear∣ed to this court, that scavadge corne is an ancient duty, time out of mind had and received by the bishop of Durham for the time being, his servants, tenants, or farmers of the said burrough markets or fayres, for all manner of corne and graine brought into the said markets and sayres, and otherwise sold in the said city of Durham. That the defendant Forster, besides other payments which were proved, did pay scavadge corne for 20 bushells of corne, which were brought to her in the week-day, and not on the markett day, and made agreement for the said scavadge corne, and was to pay and did pay in lewe thereof for some quantities of the said corne after the rate of one penny for every bushell of corn and graine she bought in the said markett or was brought unto her; and it then appeared, that the bringinge in of corne on the weeke day was to the manifest preventinge and hinderinge of the said compts. being farmers of the said scavadge corne, of the said duty and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olls of the said corne by ancient custom had and received as aforesaid; and did much tend to the inhancing of the prices of corne and graine, and was and is contrary to a proclamation made in the sixth year of his maj. reigne that now is, which is yet in force: Whereupon, and to the end this court might be better informed touchinge such order and proceedings as is elsewhere in matters of this nature, &amp;c. this court did thinke fitt to respitt the final determination of the said differences until this sittinge, &amp;c. Therefore, upon due consideration had of the proofs already made as aforesaid, and after perusal of divers suits and contro∣versies which formerly had been moved and were then depending, as well at the common law, as also in his maj. courte of the dutchie chamber, betwene Rich. Prance als Prince, plaintiff, and major <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nglebie, deputy bailiff of Knaisbrough in the county of York, and others, being the scavangers or gatherers of the markett sweepings or hand-law-corne of Knaisbrough aforesaid, defendants, touchinge the takeinge and distreyninge of certain corne in sacks of the said Richard, which was brought to the market of Knaisbrough to be sold for a due of markett sweepings or hand-lawe-corne claimed by the defendants as scavengers or gatherers of the said duty for the time being, It is ordered and decreed by the Right Hon. Sir Rich. Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton, knt. one of his maj. justices of the court of common pleas at Westminster, and chancellor of the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge. That if the said defendants or any other person or persons do at any time henceforth bringe into the said city or burrough, or suburbs of the same, any corne or graine of what nature or kind soever to be sold, or to be delivered to any person or persons upon any bargaine or contracte for the same shall before such delivery thereof present the said corne or graine in the public markett place within the said city where such corne or graine is used or accustomed to be brought and sold in the markett days as aforesaid, and thereof shall give notice to the common officer or the gatherer or taker of such scavadge corne, and after such notice given, shall stay there a convenient tyme, to the end the complts. and others the farmers aforesaid, their servants or agents, may take their scavadge corne thereof. And because this court was informed, that the dish now used for the takinge of the said scavadge or s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avell corne, did conteyne much more than the an∣tient dish wherewith the said s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avell or scavadge corne was usually taken and received did conteyne, and that the same is now reduced to the antient measure of a pinte dish, it is therefore likewise ordered by Mr Chancellor, that the said dish beinge of the measure of a pinte only, shall be from henceforth continuallye, and that quantitie and proportion to be taken for every bushell of the corne and graine so sould on the said markett and fayre dayes, and of every bushel of corn bought and delivered as aforesaid on the said weeke dayes, which are neither markett nor fayre dayes, shall conteyne onelie a pynte for every bushell, and so proportionabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e according to that rate and no more, the bushell heare conteyinge 12 gallons at the least; and that no scavadge corne shall be taken, challenged, or demanded of any thinge there brought to he sould whatsoever, other than of corn, graine, oatemeale and salt onelie, and that not of any lesse quantitie thereof then of a bushell at the least, unlesse the owner shall at any tyme bringe a bushell or more to be sould, and of purpose to defraud and defeate the said duty, shall divide the same to be sould by peeks or lesser quantities than a bushell. And it is further or¦dered by this course, that the said pynte dish shall not be uppheaped, but by hand stroke and even s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n by the taker thereof; and that the said dish shall be sealed and brought to the head burrowe courte to be
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>holden for the said citty and burrowe of Durham next after the feast of St Michael the archangel, yearlie to be viewed by the then mayor, steward, and clerke of the said courte, and the suitors there present, to con∣teyne no more quantitie then onelie a pynte as aforesaid. And this courte doth further order and set downe, that when it shall happen that the duty of scavadge corne hath been taken one markett day, and that the corne be not sould but left unsould <HI>bona fide</HI> in the citty or suburbs, and kept until the next markett day, and then brought again to be sold the said next markett day; that no more scavadge corne shall be taken for the same corne for which the said duty of scavadge was paid. And whereas it was complained to this courte, that such as brought corne to be sould on the said markett or fayre days were oftentimes constreyned to stay untill one or two of the clock in the afternoon before they might vent or sell their said corne, in regard the markett bell hath not been sooner runge, and this courte was then moved to appoint a certain hour for the most convenience and tyme the corne bell should be rung, the rather for that as was alledged, sun∣drie persons in the winter season, whose dwellings are somewhat more remote from the said city, have been constreyned by the late ringing of the said bell to stay in the towne all night to their needless charge, and so to ryde home on the Sunday. Upon consideration had whereof, it is now likewise further ordered by the courte, that the said markett bell or corne bell shall for ever hereafter be runge at 12 o'clocke or near thereupon; and if the said bell shall not be runge at twelve o'clock or near that tyme, that then it shall be lawfull for every one to sell their corne at their pleasure; but that no corne shall be sould or carryed away before the houre of twelve of the clocke, and scavadge duty thereof taken, under the danger and penaltie that the same was subject unto before, if it had been sould before the markett bell or corne bell had been runge. And lastlie, it is ordered, that if the said dish shall not be sealed, or that the taker of the said scavadge corne doe not observe this order, that then such as shall have cause and be wronged, may from tyme to tyme com∣pleyne at the next sessions of peace to be held for the county of Durham: Provided always, that this decree or any thing therein conteyned shall not extend to such only as buy corne at Newcastle and other places where toll of such corne is taken, and bring the same to their own houses in Durham, unlesse that the same parties do afterwards bringe such theire corne to the said city to be there sold againe, in which case onely, it shall be lawfull for the takers of the said scavadge corne to take toll of the said corne also ac∣cordinge to the proportion aforesaid.—<BIBL>Mann's MSS.</BIBL></P>

<P>It appears, that in late years several innovations were practised in the city, by per∣sons not free exercising their trades within the liberties, and apprentices gaining their freedom by illicit practices of the several companies.

<P>WHEREAS divers persons have of late used and exercised trades within this city of Durham and bur∣rough of Framwelgate, which trades by immemorial custom have belonged to some of the respective compa∣nies or fraternities within the said city or burrough, without being members or free of such company or fra∣ternity there, to which the said trades respectively belonged, or of any other company or fraternity there, con∣trary to the said immemorial custom there used, and much to the prejudice of the said corporation and the other members of such companies or fraternities: For the remedying thereof, it is this day ordered by the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of this corporation, That if any person or persons not being free of the company or fraternity within this corporation to which his their trade or trades hath or have usually belong∣ed, in case the same so belonged to any, or if not, of some other company or fraternity within this cor∣poration, he or they so offending shall forfeit to the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of this corpor∣ation for the time being, Twenty Shillings for every week he or they so offending shall use and exercise such trade, to be by them recovered by action or distress of the goods of the offender or offenders re∣spectively, which said respective sinns shall be paid by the mayor for the time being into the chest or hutch, for the use of the said mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, to defray any public expence that may hap∣pen to the said corporation and fraternities.</P>
<P>And it is likewise ordered by the said mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, that every person that shall here∣after be admitted a freeman into any company within the said city and burrough, shall pay the sum of One Shilling to the mayor of Durham for the time being, over and above the usual fees, which shilling shall be paid into the hutch for the purposes aforesaid.</P>
<P>And for the effectual preventing all persons being made free, that have not a right or title to their freedom in the said city, and for the better regulating the same, the mayor, one or more alderman or aldermen of the said city, and the wardens and stewards of the said several and respective companies for the time being, shall from henceforth meet at the Guild-hall or Tollbooth in the said city four times in every year, viz. on the first Monday after Martinmas, the first Monday after Candlemas, the first Monday after May-day, and the first Monday after Lammas; and every person that is hereafter to be admitted a freeman of the said city and bur∣rough of Framwelgate, shall be then and there called at three of the said several meetings, before such his ad∣mittance to be a freeman, and to be approved of by the said mayor, and one or more alderman or aldermen, and the wardens and stewards of the several and respective company or fraternity for the time being, where∣of he or they is or are to be made and admitted a freeman or freemen respectively, or the majority of the said mayor, alderman or aldermen, and wardens of such respective company then and there present.</P>

<P>And that the town-clerk of the said city for the time being shall attend at such the said meetings, to call every such person or persons as is or are to be admitted a freeman or freemen, and enter his or their names as a freeman in a book to be kept for that purpose, for which every person so admitted a freeman shall pay him six-pence as his fee for his doing thereof, over and above his usual fee.</P>
<P>And it is further ordered, that if any freeman of any company whatsoever within the said city or bur∣rough of Framwelgate shall take an apprentice after a clandestine manner, only with intent or design to make him free of the said city and burrough, and doth not actually teach his said apprentice the art and mystery of which he the said master is free, but shall turn or assign him over, or suffer him to go to some other master not freeman of the same company, or to some other place out of the said city or burrough, or the liberties thereof, to learn his trade, and only serve his master at certain times, he the said master shall forfeit the sum of Thirty Pounds to and for the use and benefit of the said mayor, aldermen, and commonalty for the purposes aforesaid, and to be recovered as aforesaid; and that any apprentice so bound, and who shall not serve his apprenticeship fairly and regularly with a freeman of the same company to which he is bound as an apprentice in the city of Durham or burrough of Framwelgate, or be legally assigned over to a trading freeman of such fraternity inhabiting within the said city or suburbs, not to be entitled to his free∣dom in the said city of Durham or burrough of Framwelgate upon any pretence whatsoever.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding such prudent regulations, several efforts were made to evade the ordinances, and in the year 1756 an experimental freedom was created to try the legality of the bye-laws or rules last mentioned, which brought on a legal discussion, in the result, confirming them as consistent with law and the constitution of the in∣corporation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Green against mayor of Durham.—King's Bench, Hilary Term, 30 Geo. II. 26th Jan. 1757.—Bur∣row's Reports, vol. i. p. 127.</P>
<P>This case was set down in the crown paper as a special verdict, and was so called and argued by one coun∣cil on each side, in the same manner as if it had been a special verdict: But it was only a verdict on six se∣veral traverses to the return of a mandamus (on 9 Ann, c. 20) directed to the mayor of Durham, command∣ing him to swear and admit Robert Green into the place and office of a freeman of the company or frater∣nity of freemasons of the city of Durham.</P>
<P>The right set up by Robert Green was, his having been duly elected and admitted a freeman of the com∣pany; but the objection to his being sworn by the mayor was, "that he had not conformed to certain bye-laws particularly specified in the return, and found by the verdict."</P>
<P>The return was, That Durham is, and for time immemorial hath been, an ancient city, &amp;c. and also that a power is given by a charter of Tobias, then bishop of Durham, in 44 Eliz. confirmed by James I. to the mayor, aldermen, and common council for the time being, or the major part of them (of whom the mayor and six of the aldermen to be seven) to make bye-laws in the stead, for, and in the name of the whole corpo∣rate body of the city of Durham and Framwelgate.</P>
<P>Then the return set forth, that certain bye-laws were duly made by the mayor, aldermen, and commonal∣ty, in due manner met and assembled at the Guild-hall, &amp;c. on the 8th Nov. 1728, and particularly spe∣cifies three several bye-laws as having been then and there made by them, for calling the names at four meetings, and the penal laws against the wardens and the mayor, &amp;c.—<HI>Vide bye-laws on the preceding page.</HI></P>
<P>All which said several ordinances and bye-laws, the return alledges to have, ever since the making thereof, been constantly observed and kept, &amp;c. and to be still in their full force and virtue, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That Robert Green was not elected and admitted a freeman of the said company of free-masons, rough-masons, wallers, paviors, plasterers▪ slaters, and bricklayers.</P>
<P>That Green was never duly called to be a freeman of the said city of Durham and Framwelgate, nor ever approved of by the mayor, or one or more alderman or aldermen of the city of Durham and Framwelgate aforesaid, and the warden and stewards of the said company or fraternity of free-masons, &amp;c. before his sup∣posed election and admission to be a freeman of the said company or fraternity, according to the first ordi∣nance or bye-law above-mentioned, as he ought to have been.</P>
<P>And for these reasons, the said mayor has not sworn and admitted him, nor administred the oaths usually taken for the due execution of the said office.</P>
<P>Upon this return, Green takes six several traverses, on which issues were tried.—1st issue, That the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, did not duly meet, &amp;c. 8th Nov. 1728, in order to make bye-laws, &amp;c. <HI>modo et</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d issue, That they did not in due manner make the first bye-law mentioned in the return.—

<P>The jury find;—as to the 1st issue, That upon the 8th of Nov. 1728, the then mayor, aldermen, and commonalty did in due manner meet and assemble at, &amp;c. in order, &amp;c. in such manner and form as the said mayor by his return hath alledged.—As to the 2d issue, That the said mayor, aldermen, and commonalty did then and there in due manner make the first bye-law in the return mentioned, in such manner and form as is therein by the said mayor alledged.—As to the third issue, That they did in due manner make the second bye-law in manner and form, &amp;c.—As to the 4th issue, The like finding with regard to the third bye-law.— As to the 5th issue, That Green was elected and admitted a freeman as in and by the writ is alledged; but that before such his admittance, he was not called at any meeting held according to the said bye-law in the said second issue mentioned, nor approved of by the then mayor, and one or more alderman or aldermen, and warden and stewards of the said company or fraternity, nor by a majority of them according to the said bye-law.—As to the 6th issue, That the said Robert Green was not duly called to be a freeman of the said city of Durham and Framwelgate, and approved of by the wardens and stewards of the said company or fraternity of free-masons, rough-masons, &amp;c. to be a freeman of the said city of Durham and Framwelgate.</P>
<P>This case was argued on the 24th of Nov. 1756, by Mr Ambler for the plaintiff, and Mr Clayton for the defendant; when the court ordered it to stand for judgment to the then next term: And lord Mansfield then delivered the resolution of the court—The general question depends upon Robert Green's right to the franchise which he claims—The objection to his right arises from his not being qualified according to the bye-law—If the bye-law is good and binding, and he appears to be an object of it, he is certainly not quali∣fied, and the mayor has returned a sufficient reason for not admitting and swearing him—All the objections which have been made, therefore, tend to set aside the bye-law; or if the bye-law be good, to shew that Green's case is not within it.—It has been argued, that the bye-law is void upon two grounds; 1st, for want of authority to make it; 2dly, from the subject matter.—As to the first, the objection is, that the bye-laws are returned to be made by the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty; whereas the power is given to the mayor, aldermen, and twenty-four common-council, or the major part of them, of whom the mayor and six alder∣men should be seven.—ANSWER. The power to the select number is, "To make bye-laws in the stead, for, and in the name of the whole corporate body." These bye-laws might be made by the select number, acting in the name of the whole incorporate body, and must be so intended: For the jury find, "That they did in due manner meet, and in due manner make the bye-laws."—As to the second, That the bye-law is unreasonable and void: For it is likened to the case of the taylors of Ipswich, (2. Co 53.) a bye-law that none should work at his trade until he had presented himself to the company of taylors, and proved that he had served seven years as an apprentice, and admitted by them to be a sufficient workman.— ANSW. In that case the bye-law was against law; it was against the 5th of Eliz. and a further restraint than that act made.—But this bye-law is not against any law; it is not a restraint upon trade, but seems a reasonable re∣gulation, to prevent persons being unduly made free, who are not entitled by birth-right, service, or pur∣chase; it provides a method for previously examining into the right of those who claim to be made free.— OBJECTION. That there is no method to compel a meeting of the mayor, alderman or aldermen, and the wardens and stewards of companies.— ANSW. This objection extends equally to all corporate assemblies, by custom, charter, or bye-law; but there is a known method by Mandamus.—OBJECT. If a person has a right to be admitted a freeman, yet unless he be approved of by the mayor, &amp;c. he is not to be admitted; and there is no method to compel them to approve.—ANSW. If the mayor, &amp;c. disapprove without a cause, a Mandamus will lie, suggesting the qualification and right of the person claiming to be a freeman, and com∣manding the mayor to approve and admit. But supposing the bye-law good, it has been argued that this case is not within it.—1st OBJECT. The Mandamus is to admit Green to the freedom of the company; the bye-law relates only to the freedom of the city.—ANSW. It appears by the second bye-law to be the same thing.—2d OBJECT. The bye-law prohibits, indeed, the election of persons not called and approved, &amp;c. and subjects disobedience to a penalty; but does not make the election void, and cannot transfer the right of election vested in the electors to the mayor. —ANSW. These objections are sounded upon a misun∣derstanding of the bye-law, and a misconception of the nature of the case. The writ recites "That Green had been duly elected and admitted a freeman," and therefore commands the mayor to swear him—The mayor returns the bye law, &amp;c and that before Green's supposed election and admittance (by the company) to be a freeman, "he was not called and approved by the mayor, &amp;c." And the fact found by the jury is▪

<PB N="35" REF="47"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>"That he was elected and admitted by the company, but not called and approved by the mayor, &amp;c." So that it appears upon this record, that the intent of the bye-law was, that no person should be elected and admitted a freeman of the company, unless he was called at the assembly and approved, &amp;c. which was a previous act to be done, before the company could elect him,—the way to prevent the abuse "That the company unduly admitted persons to their freedom." The second bye-law inflicts a penalty on the com∣pany who should make any one free without the previous calling and approbation. And the third bye-law inflicts a penalty on the mayor who should swear any such person.—The stating the fact answers both the ob∣jections: For the bye-law makes the appearance and approbation a necessary qualification to the being made free by the company; and a restraint upon them, to elect any one to his freedom, before his con∣forming to the bye-law: And the right of election is not transferred to the mayor, but remains where it was.—OBJECT. It is not returned, that there was any assembly, at which Green might appear to be called.—ANSW. It shall be intended: And if in fact there was no assembly, Green might have pleaded it excuse.—OBJECT. He might have been elected and admitted before the making this bye-law.—ANS. The jury have found, "That he was elected and admitted; but that he was not called and approved pursuant to the bye-law:" So that the bye-law was in being at the time of his election.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, that it is not stated, what is the method of the company's electing freemen, nor any thing in the charter concerning it. For aught that appears, the first bye-law may be agreeable to the an∣cient usage, and revived by this bye-law, and enforced by penalties. But supposing it to be introductory of a previous qualification, it seems to be reasonable, and well calculated to prevent improper persons, not entitled, being made free. It is much more reasonable than the custom of London, "that no broad cloth should be sold but what was brought to Blackwell-Hall to be examined," 5. Co. 62. Yet this custom was held good, because it was to prevent fraud.</P>
<P>We are of opinion, that none of the objections are well sounded, and, therefore, that the return ought to be allowed.—Consequently, as this was the case of traversing the return to a Mandamu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, pursuant to the stat. 9 Ann, cap. 20. the rule was taken, <HI>That judgment be entered for the defendant.</HI></P>

This project was played off in the year 1761, and threw the whole city into confusion, creating, in the event, such a divi∣sion in the body, that they refused to join in the exercise of the powers of their char∣ter; so that, in the year 1768, the number of members prescribed for carrying into execution the several powers of the charter, was lost, and the charter itself became disolved and obsolete. In Mr Mann's MSS.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Penes</HI> G.

<P>The candidates in this election were, Ralph Gowland <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Durham, then ma∣jor of the Durham regiment of militia, and major-general John Lambton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Harraton, in the county of Durham. The poll continued six days: At the con∣clusion the numbers stood, for Mr Gowland (including the 215 occasional free∣men) 775, for Mr Lambton 752; so that Mr Gowland was returned elected with a majority of 23 votes: But upon a petition by Mr Lambton, the house of com∣mons, on Tuesday the 11th of May 1762, resolved, that the 215 made or pretended to be made free, had no right to vote, and that general Lambton was duly elected; on a division of the house, 88 against 72.</P>

<OPENER>Humbly sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT by charter formerly granted by Tobias Matthew, bishop of Durham, in the reign of the late queen Elizabeth, the commonalty of the city of Durham were incorporated, and were made to consist of three in∣tegral parts, viz. a mayor, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four common councilmen, who by the said charter were invested with divers powers and authorities, and particularly a power was by the said charter given to the said mayor and aldermen, and their successors, solely of choosing and electing two such persons from each of the twelve trades therein named, as they should think proper, who were to be of the common coun∣cil of the said city, together and along with the said mayor and aldermen.</P>
<P>And your petitioners further humbly shew unto your lordship, that by the death and amotion of several of the aldermen who acted under the said charter, the persons now being or taking upon themselves to be alder∣men of the said city, are so reduced in point of number, as to be disabled from doing many corporate acts in cases where a particular number of the said mayor and aldermen is by the said charter required, by which means the said charter in some instances is rendered totally of no use.</P>
<P>And your petitioners further humbly shew unto your lordship, that they have been informed that a peti∣tion has already been presented, or is intended to be presented to your lordship for a new charter, subscribed only by a small part of the body of freemen of and belonging to the said city, many of whom not knowing the purport or meaning thereof, were induced to sign the same, but being since more rightly informed, are now very desirous that the said petition should be retracted and suppressed.</P>
<P>And your petitioners humbly submit to your lordship, that the power given to the mayor and aldermen of the said city by the said old charter, solely of choosing the common council, is contrary to the mode of elect∣ing in such cases given by almost every other charter in the kingdom, is very unreasonable, has all along been attended with great inconveniences, and particularly of late years, the same having been productive of many mischiefs, expensive law-suits, and other very disagreeable incidents, and is of great detriment and oppression to the said several companies and fraternities, who by such means are not represented by two such persons of their respective companies as they would respectively desire to appoint.</P>
<P>That the said old charter directs the mayor and aldermen, and their successors for the time being, or the major part of them, should yearly on the third day of October assign, name and choose twenty-four persons of the most discreet and upright men, (that is to say) two out of those twelve several arts, meetings, or facul∣ties following (to wit) two out of the mercers, grocers, haberdashers, ironmongers and salters, two out of the drapers and taylors, two out of the skinners and glovers, two out of the tanners, two out of the weavers, two out of the dyers and fullers, two out of the cordwainers, two out of the sadlers, two out of the butchers, two out of the smiths, two out of the carpenters and joiners, and two out of the free masons and rough ma∣sons, to be of the common council of the said city.</P>
<P>That there are within the said city three other trades or mysteries, viz. the goldsmiths, plumbers, pewter∣ers, potters, glaziers, and painters, the curriers and tallow chandlers, the barbers and ropers, who apprehend they have been injured in their liberties and privileges as freemen of the said city, and are desirous of being represented as a part of the collective body of the said corporation, equally and in the same manner with the other twelve trades above-mentioned.</P>
<P>To the intent therefore that your petitioners (who are by much the greater part of the freemen residing in or near the said city) and their successors freemen of all the several companies and fraternities aforesaid, may be equally and properly represented by two of the most able and discreet persons out of each of the said com∣panies or fraternities respectively, your petitioners, with all humble submission and deference to your lord∣ship, pray, that your lordship will be pleased, in the framing of such new charter, to order and direct, that such able and discreet persons as aforesaid may be annually elected and sent, as well from each of the said three trades or mysteries last above-mentioned, as from the twelve trades in the said old charter named, who may be of the common council of the said city, together and along with the said mayor and aldermen for the time being: And that the right of electing such common councilmen may be vested in the several companies from which they shall respectively be sent; and which mode and right of electing the said common council, your petitioners humbly hope, your lordship will not only approve of, but grant, as being not only reasona∣ble, but also consistent with and agreeable to almost every other corporation charter in the kingdom.</P>
<P>And your petitioners further humbly hope and pray, that your lordship at the time of granting such new charter will, according to your wonted and well-known goodness, be pleased to appoint such persons to be the new mayor, aldermen, and common councilmen as shall, by a majority of the said several companies and fraternities at a general meeting of the same, be recommended to your lordship as the most proper persons to fill such offices.</P>
<P>And that such further and other wholesome and salutary laws and ordinances may in the said new charter be contained, as will have a manifest tendency to, and promote within the said city, good rule and govern∣ment, and a due administration of public justice, and as to your lordship shall seem meet.</P>

<P>"John by the grace of God, bishop of Durham.

<P>The title of some of the aldermen was disputed upon the grounds of their not being inhabitants within Durham or Framwelgate at the time of their elections, which is a qualification required by the charter, and had been disregarded in the election of aldermen in a variety of instances at different periods. Informations in the nature of quo warranto were filed in the court of King's Bench at Westminster, against the earl of Darlington, the hon. Frederick Vane, John Tempest, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> Ra. Bowser, and John Hopper, who were removed from their office of aldermen either by judgment of ouster or disclaimer, and the hon. Gilbert Vane resigned his office.</P>
<P>The election of the common-council on the 3d of Oct. 1766, was attended with disorder and confusion, and mistakes and irregularities were then committed in the choice of some of them, which in their conse∣quences affected the title of Mr John Lambe in the office of mayor, to which he was elected the day follow∣ing; and on an information in the nature of quo warranto, judgment was obtained against him for exercising the office of mayor under that election, and from that time there has not been any legal mayor.</P>
<P>By the means before stated, and by the natural deaths of Mr Tho. Hornsby and Mr Jos. Gray, the al∣dermen are reduced to four, namely, Mr Tho. Dunn residing in Elvet, Mr Tho. Bainbridge residing in Stock∣ton, Mr John Drake Bainbridge residing at Durham, Mr Benj. Whitaker residing in America and not likely to return, and who before his departure signified his intention to resign his office of alderman.</P>
<P>In this situation, the powers and authorities vested in the corporation are suspended; and as the charter made a greater number of aldermen than at present exist essential to the election of a mayor and aldermen, I conceive it is impossible for the corporation to preserve or continue itself by the operation of the stat. of 11th Geo. I. or by any other means.</P>
<P>The expediency of a charter to revive the corporation, is admitted by the petitioners, and cannot be de∣nied or doubted. The members of the corporation, and those entitled to the privileges and advantages of it, are not the only persons interested: many charities are in the disposal of the corporation, the objects of which t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sensibly find the benevolent designs of the founders prevented and frustrated. There are besides, public reasons, which render a new charter immediately necessary.</P>
<P>I conceive your lordship is possessed of <HI>jura regalia</HI> within the county palatine of Durham, subject to the prohibitions and restrictions contained in the stat. of 27th Hen. VIII. ch. 24. and that the sole power of grant∣ing a new charter to the city of Durham and Framwelgate is vested in your lordship.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that the old charter should be the basis of the new one, and to be departed from in those particular provisions only, which have in experience been found, or probably may be inconvenient to the corporation.</P>
<P>By the old charter, the residence of an alderman within the city of Durham at the time of his election, is an indispensible qualification, &amp;c.

<HEAD>CHARITABLE FUNDS.</HEAD>
<P>"There is a charitable fund belonging to the city of Durham, for which the mayor and aldermen are trustees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account was taken by Mr Randal from the papers of Mr John Dixon, late of Durham, deceased, an eminent attorney at law.</NOTE>. Mr Henry Smith, the great benefactor of the city of Durham whilst it stood incorporated by the name of aldermen and bur∣gesses, by will dated the 20th of July 1598, gave all his coal-mines, then of the clear yearly value of 100l. besides a personal estate in money, debts, and goods, beyond debts and legacies, worth 600l. unto the city of Durham, in these words: <Q>And as touching my colemynes, and that the increase thereof may be employed for the benefit of many, I freely give them all to this city of Durham, and the cause why I doe soe, and further as followeth is, that some good trade may be devised for setting of the youth and other idle persons to work, as shall be thought most convenient, whereby some profit may arise to the benefit of the said city, and reliefe of those that are past work.</Q>—Then he gives away several legacies, and adds, <Q>All the rest that remaineth I fully give and bequeath to this city of Durham, as fully and amply as I have done my colemynes, and to the uses before expressed.</Q>—And then appoints one alderman <HI>pro tempore,</HI> Edward Wanles, dyer, and William Hall, draper, his executors, to see the said will per∣formed; and died on the 17th of November 1598. Mr Tho. Pierson was alder∣man at Mr Smith's death, and, together with Wanles and Hall, entered upon his estate, and continued the receipt and management thereof, until Tobias Matthew bishop of Durham, in the year 1602, incorporated the city by the name of mayor and aldermen, and then the succeeding mayors joined with the two executors, in the receipt and management thereof, and so it continued until the eighth year of K. James I. when a commission of pious uses was awarded to William bishop of Durham, and several others, upon which an inquest was taken, and this charity found and decreed against the executors, in whose hands it was, and several persons were appointed to be the governors thereof, particularly the then bishop, Richard Hutton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> his temporal chancellor, H. Dethick, H. Ewbanke, Rob. Cooper, and several others. Those governors (14th Aug. 1612) called the executors to an ac∣count, and found in their hands in ready cash 577l. 10s. 2d. which they received and lodged in the chest in the town chamber, which they had bought for the pur∣pose,
<PB N="57" REF="69"/>
under four locks, and there also placed the bonds and other securities and writings relating to this charity; and then ordered the New-Place <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The palace of the Nevill family.</NOTE> to be bought, for a trade of cloth-working to be set up in, which was accordingly done, and 150l. paid for the purchase thereof.</P>
<P>In May 1614, Henry Doughty and Wm Bastoe, clothworkers, were employed to begin the work, and were settled in the New-Place; and one Richard Thomlin∣son had by copy of court-roll an assignment made him of some ground upon Brass∣side Moor, <HI>de novo incremento,</HI> and inclosed it for the benefit of the works, and 200l. was paid them to provide materials, for which sum Wm Hall the executor, who had recommended these three men, was bound.</P>
<P>In September 1614 a new commission of pious uses issued, to the said bishop, chancellor Hutton, and several other commissioners, who approved of what the go∣vernors had done, and ordered 250l. more to be advanced to the clothiers, upon the statute-merchant of them and two other sureties, relations of Doughty and Bastoe, and upon surrender of Tomlinson's Intack; and so the works went forward for about two years, and then Doughty and his partners broke, and the governors took in one William Atkinson, then master of the house of correction, to spin and employ children that way, and gave him 60l. to buy wool: And also in the year 1616 the governor employed Thomas Browne and George Beecrofte, two new clothworkers, and bought them in wool, and gave them it to work, and employed William Hall the executor to be their inspector; and the work went on but slowly and to no great purpose, till Jan. 1619, and then was discontinued; and instead thereof, 20l. per annum was ordered to be paid by 5l. per quarter to the several streets in Durham, and apprentices were ordered to be bound out, ten or more per annum, as the stock should answer.</P>
<P>Thus it hath continued ever since, with the addition only of two half yearly pays more to the poor of the several streets; and in the year 1622, Wydop Leezes and Redmyers House were purchased for 660l. at the yearly rent of 50l. per annum, 3l. 6s. 8d. being discounted for a copyhold rent payable thereout annually to the bishop.</P>
<P>After this the governors put their statute-merchant in suit against Doughty and Bastoe's relations, and recovered most of the 250l. last lent; but all that Hall the executor was bound for, and more which he had got into his hands, amounting to 598l. odd money, was lost.</P>
<P>The mayors of Durham, from the discontinuing of the last clothworking in the year 1619 or 20, again received the money arising of the stock, and yearly account∣ed for it to the governors till the year 1659, and then a treasurer received it; and so it continued during the troubles, and till after the restoration, to wit, in Decem∣ber 1669, when a commission of pious uses was awarded to bishop Cosin, Dr Sud∣bury then dean of Durham, and others, and thereupon an inquest was taken, where∣by one John Heighington, who had been mayor of Durham, was found debtor for Smith's charity 414l. and for charities given by others almost as much more; but all that was got in satisfaction thereof was only the house and shop in the market-place,
<PB N="58" REF="70"/>
in Mrs Fulthorpe and alderman Paxton's possession, valued at 18l. per ann. called Heighington's Burgage.</P>
<P>In the year 1659 the receipt of the mayors of Durham was discontinued, and a treasurer appointed to receive and pay out the stock as the governors ordered. All the collieries are now failed, and have so been for many years past, so that all the stock <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Linsell bishop of Hereford and prebendary of Durham gave by will "for the use of the poor people of the city of Durham 100l. to be placed out at interest, or lands to be purchased therewith."</P>
<P>F. Buney by his will dated 20th Jan. 1626, gave to the city of Durham "20l. to be lent to poor men de∣cayed, by five marks a-piece upon good security, to be paid at the year's end."</P>
<P>Mr Walton archdeacon of Derby gave "to the city of Durham 40l. to be lent gratis to poor tradesmen by 5l. a-piece for four years together."</P>
<P>Dr Hartwell, by will dated 9th March 1724, gave to the corporation of the city of Durham "20l. a-year, to be disposed of to two merchants or tradesmen of the established church, 10l. each, that have served out their time in the said city, and want some assistance to set up with; which persons the mayor and six alder∣men or more, are unanimously to pitch upon, without favour to any but those that stand in most need of it. And that this benevolence may have its full effect, as designed by me, it shall be in the power of the mayor and all the residing aldermen to bestow the whole 20l. on any one person whom they shall judge in their con∣sciences to deserve it, by the narrowness of his circumstances. Moreover, the said 20l. per ann. is not to be paid but to the person or persons themselves, chosen by the mayor and aldermen of Durham, according to the limitations herein named, who are to certify their choice under their hands to the trustees of this part of my last will and testament."—This charity is chargeable on lands at</P>

<P><PB N="59" REF="71"/>By all this it appears, that the charitable stock of the city of Durham hath chiefly arisen from Mr Smith's charity, which was originally given for a manufactory; but by reason of the disappointments met with, by trusting the clothworkers' (who proved knaves) with the money, the governors in 1619 devised a different dispo∣sition of the charity money as before-mentioned, for which end the bulk of the stock was laid out in land."—Such is the account given of the rise of this charita∣ble stock.</P>
<P>A full illustration of the foregoing history of the charitable stock will appear in the inquisitions taken by virtue of the several commissions for charitable uses men∣tioned hereafter.</P>
<P>The first commission bears date the 12th of March, 1609, directed to William lord bishop of Durham and others, <Q>for the due execution of a certain statute made in the high court of parliament, holden the 27th of October, in the 43d year of the reign of queen Elizabeth, entitled, An act to redress the misem∣ployments of lands, goods, and stocks of money given to charitable uses; to enquire by the oaths of twelve lawful men, &amp;c.</Q> A new commission in like form issued, dated the 22d of Feb. 1610.</P>
<P>To these commissions, or the one of them, an inquisition was taken and return∣ed at the city of Durham the 28th day of March, 1611, setting forth, that <Q><HI>Hen. Smith,</HI> of Durham, gentleman, deceased, by his last will and testament, written in his life-time, subscribed and sealed, &amp;c. the 20th of July, 1598, did bequeath all his leases of the <HI>colemines of Hargyll, Grewburne, and Softley,</HI> in the county of Durham, and all the estate, tithe, and interest that he had therein for divers yeares then unexpired, by virtue of sundry leases made to him by the queen (Elizabeth) and bishops of Durham, xx lb. yearly rent yssuing out of the <HI>cole∣pitts called Carter-thorne Colliery-pitts,</HI> in the said county; the interest in which myne of coales he in his said will devised to Toby lord archbishop of York, his grace then bishop of Durham, to all his terme therein yet for sundry yeares by course of tyme contynuing, to the cittie of Durham, with all his coales above the ground, with all implements whatsoever, and all books of reckonnings, with all leases and writings touching the said colepitts, with all the coales pro∣vided for those uses, and two great chists wherein they were<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So in the original.</NOTE>; that the increase thereof might be employed to the benefit of manie, &amp;c. And they also say, that he did by his last will give sundry legacies to sundry his friends, amounting in all to the sum of 305l. and for the payment of the said legacies only, did nominate Tho. Pearson then alderman of the said city of Durham, Edw. Wan∣less of the said city, dyer, and Wm Hall of the same, draper, his executors;
<PB N="60" REF="72"/>
and upon payment of the said legacies did ordaine, that his said executors should be no further troubled; and all the rest of his goods he did bequeath to the ci∣ty, of Durham for the uses above expressed.</Q> And then sets forth the receipt of the profits of the colemines from the year 1598 to 1607, but no amount is men∣tioned. The inquisition also further sets forth, that <Q><HI>John Franklyn,</HI> then late of Coken, in the county of Durham, gentleman, did, by his last will, dated the 19th of Nov. 1572, bequeath 100 l. to the mayor, aldermen and others of Newcastle, upon condition that they should see paid for the same xl. yearly for the increase thereof (part of which) 3 l. 6 s. 8 d. to the prisoners and other poor people of Durham.</Q></P>
<P>Several subsequent commissions issued, one in 1617, another 1622, a third 1629, and a fourth during the usurpation in 1659, directed to Sir Tho. Widdrington, knt. Sir Arthur Hazelrigg, bart. Sir Geo. Vane, knt.

<HEAD>THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING shewn the government of the city, and privileges of the incorporated body, we beg leave to call the reader's attention to the history and descrip∣tion of the cathedral church.</P>
<P>In the preceding volume, under the annals of the bishops, are shewn the origin and foundation of this rich church, which renders it unnecessary now to revert to many of the facts there stated.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect, that in the first institution this church was served by secular clergy, who are said to have been governed by a provost. Bishop Walcher first projected a change, intending to introduce regular canons, but did not live to effect his purpose. His successor, William de Carilepho, in the year 1083 ac∣complished that matter, aided by the power of the crown, under the influence of the See of Rome. He applied to pope Gregory the Seventh for his precept or licence, on which he grounded his charter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. notes vol. i. p. 133, where an extract from this charter is given.</NOTE>, thereby declaring he granted the same by the command and council of the holy See, and that the king was present at the time of making thereof; and ordained, that all future priors of the church at Dur∣ham should possess the liberties, dignities, and honours of abbots, with the ab∣bot's seat in the choir of the church; and to hold all their lands, churches, and possessions in their own hands and free disposition, so as the revenues thereof might thereby be increased as much as possible, exempted from royal customs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. vol. ii. p. 384.—Wharton's Anglia Sacra, p. 785.—Dugdale's Monast. Angl. vol. i. p. 42.</NOTE>. He ob∣tained the king's diploma to maintain and support his charter, dated in the year 1084, establishing the removal of the secular clergy from his episcopal church, and translating thither monks from Jarrow and Weremouth monasteries, who were of the order of St Augustine; by which instrument the king ordained, that all priors of that monastery should possess the same liberties, customs, dignities, and honours, as abbots <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See vol. i. p. 135. for this record.—Monast. Ang. vol. i. p. 44.</NOTE>; to hold the left-hand seat in the choir; have full power of appointing and removing the officers of the church; similar to the authority of a dean, have the first place and voice after the bishop; when in chapter, the first voice in all elections to the See; and, whatever dignities and honours the dean of York held, inferior to the archbishop, but superior to the archdeacon, the prior of Durham should equally hold in inferiority to his prelate, but in superiority of the archdeacon. By this instrument, the king also confirmed whatever the bishop had granted to his convent; and declared his protection of the monastery and its posses∣sions, as well those then enjoyed, as whatever should thereafter be acquired by the money of St Cuthbert or otherwise, with <HI>sac.</HI> and <HI>socne, tol</HI> and <HI>team,</HI> and <HI>infangeon∣theof,

privilege of courts,</HI> and <HI>wreck</HI> of the sea: And he also thereby ordained, that the convent and their people should be for ever thereafter exempt from all outgo∣ings, exactions, rents, tolls, and all other royal customs appertaining to the crown.

<P>The seculars, though removed from the seat of dignity, were not sent abroad unprovided for, several places being prepared for their residence, as will be shewn in the course of this work.</P>
<P>Not content with solely accomplishing so great a reformation, this prelate gave to the monastery, Rennington, the two Pittingtons, Hesselton, Dalton, Merrington, Shincliff, and Elvet; with Willington and Wall's-End north of Tyne, together with the churches of Lindisfarn, the adjacent villages of Fenham, Norham, and Skirworth, with divers churches in Yorkshire; and other donations were added by the king, among which are lands in Keverston and Gretham.</P>
<P>After the bishop's return from exile, he furnished the altar with various vessels and ornaments of gold and silver, and gave to the convent a large collection of va∣luable books <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. vol. ii. p. 381.</NOTE>. It would be an unprofitable labour in this place to note the several gifts of lands, as the whole possessions of the church appear in the endowment after the Reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="75"/>The bishop, conceiving the church built by his predecessors was not of suitable magnificence to the dignity and increasing power of the See, formed a plan for a new erection, similar to the superb structures he had seen on the continent; and in the year 1093 he began to erect the stately edifice, now the subject of our attention. Though the art of making glass was introduced from France in the beginning of the seventh century, and Eddius, who wrote the life of Wilfrid, and lived about the year 720, asserts, that he glazed the windows of the church of York when he repaired that edifice, yet we have no proofs to maintain the assertion. It is probable that the use of glass prevailed greatly when our prelate began this work. The ori∣ginal form of the windows was of the circular arch, similar to the galleries above the ailes, and they were constructed for glazing. Glass windows introduced great embellishments in public edifices, as the use of stucco and plaistering succeeded that improvement; before which the insides of the walls were regularly chisselled and polished; which circumstance has contributed greatly to the permanency of ancient buildings, the inside surface being as exactly compacted as the outside. The large windows introduced in this building are apparently of a fashion and fa∣brication more modern than the eleventh century, their pointed arches in nowise corresponding with the mode which is adopted through the greatest part of the an∣cient edifice, that kind of arch being, as our best authors agree, introduced since the reign of Henry II. The annexed plate, taken from as accurate a drawing as perhaps was ever given to the public, will save much description, and convey to the reader the most perfect idea of this fabric before the repairs and embellishments now carrying on were begun. In the plates given in the Monasticon, the western towers are ornamented with spires, which went to decay, and were removed many years ago. In Willis's Cathedrals is a beautiful plate of the north front, dedicated to bishop Talbot, but the drawing is contracted and inaccurate.</P>
<P>The foundation of the church was laid on the 11th of Aug. 1093, with a solem∣nity suited to so great and pious a work, the bishop being assisted therein by Mal∣colm king of Scotland, and Turgot the prior: But the prelate departing this life in the year 1095<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>1093, 11th Aug.

<HEAD>The SOUTH ALLEY of the CLOYSTERS.</HEAD>
<P>On the south side of the cloysters, was fastened to the wall at the side of the cloyster door, a seat, having four feet and a back of wood, and boarded under foot for warmth: On this the porter was seated, to keep the cloyster door. The last porter was Edward Pattison. From the stool westward, on the south side, was a long bench of stone, almost to the Frater-house door, whereon were seated certain children in a row, upon Maunday Thursday, it being intended for that purpose. The whole convent of monks had each a boy as∣signed him, whose feet he was to wash and dry with a towel, and every monk then kissed the feet he had washed, and gave to each child thirty pence in money, seven red herrings, three loaves of bread, and a wa∣fer cake, serving every child with drink themselves: This godly ceremony thus ended; after prayers said by the prior and convent, they all departed in good decorum. At the end of the bench adjoining to the Frater-house door, was a fine almery fixed to the wall, and another on the other side of the door; the fore part of the almeries was through-carved work, to admit air to the towels, and three doors in the fore part of each almery, and a lock on each, to which every monk had a key, to dry their hands with the towels when they washed and went to dinner. This stool and bench Tobias Matthew, then dean of Durham, caused to be taken down, and made as plain as the rest of the floor of the cloysters.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The FRATER-HOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>In the south alley of the cloysters, is a large hall, called the Frater-house, finely wainscotted on the north and south sides; and in the west and nether part thereof, is a long bench of stone, in mason-work, from the cellar door to the pantry or cove door: Above the bench is wainscot-work two yards and a half high, finely carved, set with embossed work in wainscot, and gilded under the carved work. Above the wainscot was a large picture of our Saviour Christ, the blessed Virgin, and St John, in fine gilt work, and most excellent colours; which pictures having been washed over with lime, did long appear through it. This wainscot had engraven on the top of it, Thomas Castell, prior, anno Domini 1518, mensis Julij. Whence it is manifest, that prior Castell wainscotted the Frater-house.</P>
<P>Within the Frater-house door, on the left-hand at entering, is a strong almery in the wall, wherein a great mazer, called the grace-cup, stood, which every day served the monks after grace, to drink out of round the table; the cup was finely edged about with silver, and double gilt. In the same place were kept many large and great mazers of the same sort; among which was one called Judas's cup, edged about with silver, and double gilt, having a base to stand upon of silver double gilt: This was never in use but on Maundy Thursday, at night, when the prior and convent met to keep their Maundy. In the same almery was a goodly cup, cal∣led St Bede's bowl; the outside was of black mazer, the inside of silver double gilt, and the edge finely wrought with silver, and double gilt; in the midst was the picture of the holy St Bede, sitting in a writing posture; the base thereof of silver, double gilt, with four joints of silver coming down, all double gilt from the edge to the base to be taken in pieces. In that almery lay all the best plate that served the whole convent in the Frater-house on festival days; and there was a fine work of carved wainscot, and a strong lock on the door, so that none could perceive there was any almery at all, the key-hole being made under the carved work of the wain∣scot: And there is another large a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mery within the Frater-house, on the right-hand on going to the cellar, of wainscot, having several almeries within, fine wrought, and varished over with red varnish, in which lay seve∣ral table-cloths, salts, mazers, a bason and ewer of latten, with other things pertaining to the Frater-house, and the loft where the monks dined and supped. Every monk had his mazer to himself to drink in, and all other things that served the whole convent, and the Frater-house, in their daily service, at their diet, and at their table. All the mazers were finely edged with double gilt silver, and another bason and ewer of latten. On this ewer was pourtrayed a man on horseback, as riding a-hunting, which served the sub-prior to wash his hands in at the aforesaid table, he sitting there as chief.</P>
<P>In this Frater-house the prior and whole convent of the monks held the great feast of St Cuthbert, in Lent, having their meat served out of the dresser-window of the great kitchen into the Frater-house, and their drink out of the great cellar. From the east end, being the highest of the Frater-house, adjoining to the deanery, the roof of lead was taken down by dean Whittingham, and that part annexed to his own house, making it a flat roof, whereby he gained twenty pounds.</P>
<P>At the east end of the Frater-house stood a neat table, with a screen of wainscot over it, being kept for the master of the novices, the elects, and the novices, to dine and sup at, having their meat served to them in at the dresser widow from the great kitchen, and their drink out of the great cellar.</P>
<P>At these times the master observed these wholesome and godly orders, for the continual instruction of their youth in virtue and learning; that is, one of the novices, appointed by the master, read some part of the Old and New Testament in Latin, during dinner, having a convenient place at the south end of the high table,
<PB N="65" REF="77"/>within a beautiful glass widow, encompassed with iron, and certain stone-steps, with iron rails to go up to an iron desk, whereon lay the holy Bible. When he had done reading, the master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any a silver bell, bringing over his head, thereby giving notice to one of the novices to come to the high table and say grace; and that ended, they departed to their books.</P>
<P>Within the cloyster-garth, over against the Frater-house door, was a sine laver or conduit, for the monks to wash their hands and faces in, being in form round, covered with lead, and all of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, excepting the outer wall, within which they might walk about the laver.

The workmanship was both fine and costly. Adjoining to the east side of the conduit door hung a bell, to call the monks at eleven o'clock, to wash before dinner. In the closets or almeries, on each side of the Frater house door, in the cloys∣ters, towels were kept white and clean to dry their hands upon.</P>

<HEAD>TURGOT,</HEAD>
<P>to whom the modern historian is so much indebted for information touching the ancient state of this See, was said to be of noble birth, and, in his youth, one of those unhappy persons who were confined in the castle of Lincoln, soon after the Norman conquest: Escaping from prison, he fled to Norway, and was graciously received. Some years after, returning to England, he suffered shipwreck, and lost all his effects. He resorted to Durham, where he obtain∣ed protection of bishop Walcher, who recommended a religious life to him, and placed him under the tuition of Aldwine at Jarrow. From that monastery he went to Melros; from thence to Weremouth, where he assumed the monastic habit; and, lastly, returned to Durham. On Aldwine's death, Turgot, with the general assent of the prelate and monastery, was elected prior of Durham in the year 1087, the office of archdeacon being annexed to that dignity. The monastery profited greatly by his prudent government; the privileges were enlarged, and revenues conside∣rably increased by his influence; and he promoted many improvements in the sacred edifices. He contributed an everlasting ornament to the monastery by the Ecclesi∣astical History which he compiled, beginning with the foundation of the See, and proceeding to the year 1096. After filling the office of prior with great dignity and piety for near twenty years, he was elected bishop of St Andrew's and primate of Scotland in 1107, and consecrated by archbishop Thomas, at York, on the 1st of August, 1109<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ang. bac. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>86.—Hoveden, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.—Symeon, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>.

<HEAD>The CUSTOM of BURYING PRIORS.</HEAD>
<P>The priors of the house of Durham were accustomed in ancient time to be buried in their boots, and wound in their cowls by the barber, as the monks used to be buried. The dead prior was carried out of his lodgings in the priory, to the chamber in the infirmary, called the Dead Man's Chamber, there to remain a certain time: At night he was carried into a chapel opposite to that chamber door, called St Andrew's Chapel, and was watched all that night by the children of the almery, reading David's psalms over him; and two monks either of kindred or kindness, were appointed to sit all night at his feet, mourning for him. In the morning he was carried into the chapter-house, where the same solemn service was performed for him, which the monks had at their burial; thence he was carried through the parlour into the centry-garth to be buried, where every prior lay under a sine marble stone: And the monks and barber buried him with a little chalice of silver, other metal, or wax, which was laid upon his breast within the coffin, and his blue bed was held over him by four monks till he was buried, which the barber had for his pains, for making the grave and burying him, as he had for the monks.</P>
<P>Afterwards the priors were buried within the church, and not in the centry-garth, in the same order and habit, with the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, and all other furniture, as their predecessors were buried before them in the centry-garth — Ancient Customs of the Church at Durham.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q></NOTE>. He was buried in the chapter-house, between bishops Walcher and William.</P>
<P>After Turgot's departure for the See of St Andrew's, unhappy dissentions took place between the monastery and bishop Flambard; no prior was appointed for a considerable time; and the duties of archdeacon, official, and vicar-general, were severed from the office of prior: The bishop also possessed himself of several of the conventual estates, as lands beyond the bridge which he built, called Framwel∣gate or Durham bridge, Staindrop, Blakiston, lands in Wolviston and Burdon, and the church of Siggeston.</P>
<P>Before we advance further in the history of this church, it is necessary to observe, that the monks translated thither were of the Benedictine order. They followed the rules of St Benedict, who was born at Norsi, in the dukedom of Spoletto, in Italy, about the year 480, and died about 543. But his rule seems not to have been confirmed till 52 years after his death, when pope Gregory the Great gave a sanction to it. The habit of these monks was a black loose coat, or a gown of stuff reaching down to their heels, with a cowl or hood of the same, and a scapu∣lary;
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>
and under that, a white habit, as large as the former, made of flannel, with boots on their legs; and from the colour of their outward habit, they were gene∣rally called Black monks.

At cock-crowing, or the NOCTURNAL: This service was performed at two o'clock in the morning: The reason for pitching upon this hour, is taken partly from David's saying, <HI>At midnight I will praise the Lord,</HI> and partly from a tradition of our Saviour's rising from the dead about that time. MATINS: These were said at the first hour, or, according to our computation, at six o'clock: At this time the Jewish morning sacrifice was offered: The angels likewise were sup∣posed to have acquainted the women with our Saviour's resurrection about this hour. The TIERCE; which was at nine in the morning, when our Saviour was condem∣ned and scourged by Pilate. The SEXTE, or twelve at noon. The NONE, or three in the afternoon: At this hour it is said our Saviour gave up the ghost; be∣sides which circumstance, it was a time for public prayer in the temple at Jeru∣salem. VESPERS, at six in the afternoon: The evening sacrifice was then offered in the Jewish temple; and our Saviour is supposed to have been taken down from the cross at this hour. The COMPLINE: This service was performed after seven, when our Saviour's agony in the garden, it is believed, begun. The monks going to bed at eight, had six hours to sleep before the Nocturnal began: If they went to bed after that service, it was not, as we understand, reckoned a fault; but after mattins they were not allowed that liberty. At the tolling of the bell for prayers, the monks were immediately to leave off their business; and herein the canon was so strict, that those who copied books, or were clerks in any business, and had begun a text letter, were not allowed to finish it. Those who were employed abroad about the business of the house, were presumed to be present, and excused other duties; and that they might not suffer by being elsewhere, they were parti∣cularly recommended to the divine protection. The monks were obliged to go al∣ways two together; this was done to guard their conduct, to prompt them to good thoughts, and furnish them with a witness to defend their behaviour. From Easter to Whitsuntide the primitive church observed no fasts; at other times the reli∣gious were bound to fast till three o'clock on Wednesdays and Fridays; but the twelve days in Christmas were excepted in this canon. Every day in Lent they were enjoined to fast till six in the evening: During this solemnity, they shortened their refreshment, allowed fewer hours for sleep, and spent more time in their de∣votions; but they were not permitted to go into voluntary austerities, without leave from the abbot. They were not to talk in the refectory at meals, but hearken to the scriptures read to them at that time. The Septimarians, so called from their weekly offices of readers, waiters, cooks, &amp;c. were to dine by themselves, after the rest. Those who were absent about business, had the same hours of prayer pre∣scribed,
<PB N="68" REF="80"/>
though not the same length of devotions. Those sent abroad, and ex∣pected to return at night, were forbidden to eat till they came home: But this canon was sometimes dispensed with. The Compline was to be solemnly sung about seven at night: The service concluded with this verse, <HI>Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips.</HI> After this service the monks were not al∣lowed to talk, but went to bed immediately. They were all to sleep in the same dormitory, but not two in a bed: They lay in their cloaths. For small faults they were excluded the public table; but for greater, were debarred religious commerce, and the service of the chapel: And those conversing with a person under such censure, were liable to the same punishment. Incorrigible criminals were ex∣pelled the monasteries. When a brother was again received after expulsion, he lost his seniority, and was placed the last in the convent. Every monk was to have two coats and two cowls; and when they had new cloaths, their old ones were given to the poor: Each had a table-book, a knife, a needle, and a handkerchief: The furniture of the bed was a mat, blanket, rug, and pillow. The superior was never to dine alone; so, when there were no strangers, he was to invite some of his brethren to his table.—Such were the regulations of this monastery.</P>

<P>Hugh Pudsey, after the example of his predecessors, was desirous of contributing to the beauty and magnificence of the church at Durham, and projected a sumptu∣ous addition towards the east. The only author who mentions this, is Geoffrey de Coldingham <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Ang. Sac. p. 722, 723.</NOTE>, who tells us, that he began to erect a new work at the east end of the church, for which he imported from abroad marble columns and bases; but having laid the foundations, and carried up the walls to some considerable height, employing the most skilful artists therein, the building repeatedly failed and shrunk, to the imminent peril of the workmen; which sufficiently indicated to him, that the intended work was not acceptable to Heaven and St Cuthbert: So that he de∣sisted therefrom, and built the Gallilee at the west end of the church, for the re∣ception of women; where they might have the benefit of the holy offices, being otherwise debarred from the solemnities. It doth not appear the marble columns were placed in the Gallilee. It must be observed in this place, that the eastern transept of the church is rather a singularity, and was not built near the time of the other parts; the architecture throughout the whole being different. Great im∣provements in architecture were made, from the aera of the foundation by bishop William, to the time of bishop Pudsey's death: The more elegant Gothic order
<PB N="71" REF="83"/>
took place of the Saxon, and the pointed arches came in use: All the windows of this part of the edifice, in the lower arrangement to the east, are pointed: The clustered pilasters are chiefly of marble, though shamefully defaced and bedaubed with a wash of lime and ochre: There are no marble pilasters in any other part of the church, or any of the like order of masonry. Although no historian tells us who finished this work, yet that it was begun by bishop Pudsey is certain, and left by him unfinished for reasons hid in superstitious allegory; probably it was com∣pleated in the time of bishop Farnham and prior Thomas Melsonby. The Gallilee, said to be built by bishop Pudsey, doth not appear to be wholly a new erection; it is probable he improved it, and appropriated the place to the pious purpose before ascribed to it: It is formed with a triple range of pillars, so as to divide it into five ailes, nearly of equal width; the arches are circular, and ornamented with zigzag mouldings; the pillars are light, and clustered; above the arches is a dead facing or wall, which goes up to the roof, without any apparent utility, and far from be∣ing ornamental; the windows are pointed. It is noted to us, that a certain part of the most ancient churches had a place called the Gallilee, where the processions ended <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>E Catalog. Cod. MS. Ecclesiae Cathedr.

<HEAD>THOMAS MELSONBY</HEAD>
<P>was elected prior in 1233; and on the decease of bishop Richard, in the year 1237, was nominated to succeed him, and with much reluctance submitted to the choice. He was objected to by the king, who alledged many things against him of a politi∣cal nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 204.</NOTE>, and others personal: <Q>That he was an infringer of the liberties of the church, was diseased in body, had broken his vow, and disregarded religious in∣junctions, particularly the ordained fasts; that he was guilty of simony, was il∣literate,</Q> and such like charges, equally slanderous and untrue. After such an opposition, unwilling the See should longer continue vacant, he renounced his elec∣tion, and bishop Farnham succeeded. Fearful of the king's resentment, he resigned his office in the year 1244, and retired to Farne island, where in acts of piety and charity he spent the remainder of his life. His body was brought to Durham to be interred. In the year 1242 the prior, with the approbation and assistance of the bishop, began to remove the whole of the old roof from the cathedral church, and gave this noble edifice the additional elegance of a vault of stone-work. Willis as∣cribes this work to the bishop in these words: <Q>Bishop Farnham, (temp. Hen. III.) vaulted over the roof of the church with stone.</Q> Whoever pays due attention to the mode of architecture in this part of the edifice, will easily discover that the roof of the choir and eastern transept are of similar workmanship. Graystanes, who was a monk of Durham, and lived within a century of the time we are speaking of, is most to be credited; and his words are, <Q>Anno Domini <HI>1242,</HI> incoepit Thomas prior novam fabricam ecclesiae circum festum S.

The windows of the lanthern are pointed and ornamented with tabernacle work in pinnacles, which kind of decoration appears no where but on the buttresses of the east front. The pilasters to the windows in the lanthern are similar to those in the eastern transept, and not like any other parts of the edifice. It is not easy to determine what kind of center tower this church first had; but, from the uniformity of the outside plan, it may be conjectured it was similar to the western towers, and without much or∣nament. Three bells hung in the center tower, which were rung to give notice of the services of the church; four bells for other occasions, as rejoicings, &amp;c. were being in the north-west tower adjoining the Gallilee. The new work or lanthern terminated at the gallery vulgarly called <HI>the bellringers walk.</HI> The upper tower was added some years after, in bishop Stichill's time.

</TEXT></Q></NOTE>. Against this contract our prior appealed, alledging, that he and his con∣vent were at all times ready to obey the pope in things lawful and practicable; but to spoil their churches of their goods, to subvert their liberties, and straiten their maintenance, would be such an indignity to the church, scandal to the clergy, and reproach to religion itself, that they never could assent thereto. It cannot be doubt∣ed but this reply would prove offensive, as well to the See of Rome as the crown of England; and in 1258 we see the prior resigning his dignity, though the historians of that time do not immediately express it to be in consequence of such displeasure. On the 17th of the calends of August the prior petitioned the convent to admit of his resignation, and that they would provide a maintenance for his retirement, al∣ledging at once his want of constitutional abilities to execute the duties of his high office, and also the services he had undergone in forty years monastic life, fourteen of which he had been prior; he asserted, he had obtained a bull for his dismission, but would not use its authority. Messengers were accordingly sent to the bishop with his requisition, who in return commanded his commissioners to hear the al∣legations, and they by virtue of their authority admitted the same, and committed the care of the spiritualties of the monastery to the sub-prior, and the temporalties to R. de Waltham, constable of the castle. The convent assigned to Bertram for his maintenance, the churches of Pittington, Heighington, &amp;c. Notwithstanding the great work he had carried on in the church for two years, he left to his successor in the conventual treasury 11,000 marks. He was not only a zealous churchman, giving up his life to acts of piety, but also a punctual maintainer of the rights of the monastery. He left to the monastic library many of his compositions and learned works. His name was held in pious veneration by the cloister. His frugality was manifested in his management of the revenue allotted him, for therewith he not only supplied the necessities of life, but was enabled to build at Beaurepaire a lodge or summer retreat, with a chapel, not inferior in elegance to other erections of the like nature in the diocese.</P>

Sac. p. 741.</NOTE>. During the wars of the barons, he conducted himself so prudently, as to save the possessions of the church from depredations by either party. He contributed greatly to the magnificence of his convent. He built the belfry on the summit of the great tower of the cathedral church, and enlarged the organ: He also emparked Muggleswick and Beaurepaire. At Wardelau, as one author writes, he erected a lodge or camera, a hall and chapel, which were afterwards destroyed by the Scots in their incursion: He built a lodge or camera at Muggleswick; the remains of which, and also that at Beaurepaire, will be described in the progress of this work <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 741.</NOTE>. In this prior's time, a bull was obtained from the pope for the appropriation of Hoveden church for an addition of sixteen monks; but, at a considerable expence, he procured the appointment to be converted into prebends, apprehending they would prove as honourable and advan∣tageous promotions, and as acceptable to the clergy whom he wished to serve, as if the original institution was maintained. This prior was distinguished for his hospi∣tality and charitable actions: Whenever he came to his house, the poor people, to whom his kitchen was ever open, danced before him: P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im the scriptures were fulfilled, in cloathing the naked and feeding the hungry. It is said of him, that the common coinage of a denarius or penny was reduced to five mites, that he might distribute handfuls of that small money to a greater number of objects. When advanced in years, and obliged to travel in a chariot, he constantly threw money from thence to the poor. He was a person of approved wisdom, as well as of a magnificent mind. Frequent applications were made to the bishop to re∣ceive his resignation, pleading his infirmities and age, which in the event produced an altercation between the convent and prelate concerning profession of obedience by the monks <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>MSS. B. iv. p. 24. D &amp; Chap. Lib.</P>
<P>Folio quarto inscribitur haec formula professionis quae a monachis Dunelm, religionem ingredientibus fieri solebat: "Ego frater N. presbyter vel diaconus promitto stabilitatem meam et conversionem morum meo∣rum et obedientiam secundum regulam S'ci Benedicti coram Deo et sanctis ejus in hoc monasterio, quod est constructum in honorem Sanctae Mariae semper Virginis et Sancti Cuthberti praesulis in praesentia D'ni. Amen."</P></NOTE>, the convent alledging their prior was not of the same rank with others, he having the privileges of an abbot, and the monk's profession was the right of an abbot. But at length the convent agreed, that the monks should first make profession to the prior and then to the prelate, and receive his solemn bene∣diction: Whereupon they sent messengers to the bishop, that they were willing
<PB N="78" REF="90"/>
to make their profession and receive his benediction; but the business was still de∣layed, on account of some formalities which remained unsettled, until the 10th of January, when the bishop in the chapter-house accepted the prior's resignation, and the manors of Wardelau (according to our author's words) and Muggleswick were assigned for his maintenance; the bishop added Ryton thereto. These affairs being settled, a conversation took place between one of the monks and the bishop, in which the bishop complained with warmth that "he had suffered greater indignity and disrespect than any of his predecessors;" but declared, "he would seek satis∣faction in God's good time." He had scarce departed the gates before his senescal, with the constable of the castle and their officers, entered the convent, pronouncing, that they came at the prelate's command, in his place, to have custody of the house during the vacancy of the office of prior. The next day the senescal, calling the sub-prior and other officers of the houshold into the hall, commanded the porters, the marshal, and other secular servants of the monastery, to come forth, saying, the house was in the custody of the lord bishop, therefore he desired to see who were proper to take care of it, that he might take their oaths of fidelity, remove those he did not approve, and substitute others in their places. He was answered, such proceedings were altogether unprecedented; and it was with difficulty he was per∣suaded to wait till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> next day, to give the convent time to consult the bishop thereon. Two of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethren were sent without delay to the bishop, with a peti∣tion for licence to elect a prior; on perusing which, he rejected it, not being ad∣dressed to him as supreme lord and patron; alledging, if he was not patron, they were under no necessity to seek a licence. When the monks said the instrument was in the usual form, he contradicted them, asserting, that after the death of prior Thomas, his predecessor bishop Farnham for the same cause rejected the conventual petition. On the return of the messengers, many of the convent recollected that the cause of such precedented rejection was not as alledged by the bishop; for in the instrument referred to, the bishop was addressed as father and patron in spiritu∣alties and temporalties, but the seal of the convent by accident had been separated from the instrument before it came to the prelate's hands, which occasioned it to be renewed before he granted his licence. It was accordingly set forth in the argu∣ments on this subject, that as the bishop was in fact patron of the church, no reason appeared why he should not be addressed as such in their process; which was assent∣ed to. On the succeeding day letters were issued, in which he was stiled <HI>Reverend father and patron:</HI> Messengers being sent therewith, they were graciously received, and licence for the election of a prior was immediately granted; in consequence of which the bishop's officers were withdrawn from the convent.</P>

<HEAD>RICHARD CLAXTON,</HEAD>
<P>prior of the cell of Holy Island, was elected prior of Durham on the 26th of Jan. 1273, and in the 12th of the pontificate of bishop Stichill; on the second day fol∣lowing he was confirmed at Darlington, was installed by the archdeacon of Dur∣ham on the day of the purification of the Virgin Mary, and three days afterwards confirmed the provision made for his predecessor on his resignation. Before the above instance, we are not told by any historian of the priors having the solemni∣ties of confirmation and installation, though it is probable it was an ancient usage here. The prior abdicated his office on the 27th of December, 1285: No reason is assigned by our author for this act, who tells us, that the prior was not only a man of great piety and hospitality, but of strict circumspection and attention touching the rights of the monastery; and notwithstanding the great provision made for prior Hugh, and the expensive litigations prosecuted between the arch∣bishop of York and his church, the convent abounded in wealth during his whole administration. He had assigned him for maintenance the cell of Weremouth, with the tithes of Southwick. In May, 1274, pope Gregory IV. held a council at Lyons, to which the prior was called, but did not attend, having only his proctors there: Bishop Stichill dying in that year, the archbishop during the va∣cancy of the See appointed a visitation to be held in the chapter-house at Durham the day before the vigil of All-Saints, which was submitted to at that time; after which ceremony the archbishop repaired to the castle, where he was entertained, Henry de Horncastre, then sacrist of the cathedral church of Durham, bearing the

crucifix before him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes — Wharton's Angl. Sac. p. 742, 743, 788.</NOTE>. Robert de Graystanes gives an instance of the authority of the prior, which shews one of the ancient customs of the monastery, viz. <Q>That bishop Stichill, whilst he was resident in the castle at Durham, made it his cus∣tom to send wine to the convent: One day he ordered his butler to carry wine to the sub-prior's table, which on being presented gave offence to prior Hugh, who presided at the upper table, and thereupon he struck the table, and put an end to dinner in the middle of the mess<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 746, 747.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Bishop Robert de Insula, who succeeded to the See, gave to the prior and con∣vent the advowson of the church of Meldon in his diocese, accepting in exchange the sole presentation to the church of Waldenestow, in the diocese of Lincoln, to which the prior and convent had an alternate right with him: He also granted them Freewarren in Billingham, with the woods there.

<HEAD>HUGH OF DERLYNGTON</HEAD>
<P>was recalled to that dignity on the 11th of January, 1285; was confirmed by the bishop on the 31st of the same month, and installed on the 7th day of February following<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 748.</NOTE>. He continued a short time in office under this second election, his last resignation taking place on the 11th of March, 1290, or according to Gray∣stanes 1289 <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. That author tells us, the prior came to an agreement with the archbishop of York, assenting to his exercise of jurisdiction over the churches of the diocese during a vacancy of the See of Durham, as appears by an instrument in writing, dated in the year 1286, on which all preceding censures and judicial sen∣tences touching that matter were rescinded. He says, the prior before his second abdication was in a superannuated state of mind, yet so obstinate and resentful, that when application was made for his removal on account of his incapacity, he sent messengers to the bishop, with a promise of large bribes, to induce him to deny his suspension, which did not prevail; whereupon he yielded with great reluctance to a cession of his office.</P>

<HEAD>RICHARD DE HOTOUN</HEAD>
<P>, prior of the cell of Lynche or Latham, was elected on the 24th of March to suc∣ceed Hugh of Derlyngton; was confirmed by the bishop on the 28th of the same month, and installed on the 9th of April. This prior was of a bold and virtuous mind, and having to do with the overbearing and proud prelate Bek, was obliged to exert himself for the preservation of the privileges of his church: A dispute soon arose between them, which was fermented to a violent height, as has already been related in the annals of that prelate<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 244.</NOTE>; the excommunication, suspension, and inter∣diction of the prior being at length the consequence of their contest. The bishop thereupon commanded the convent to elect a prior; and they not obeying, he ob∣truded upon them Henry de Luceby, who then presided in the cell of Holy Island: He was accordingly installed, on prior Richard being dragged from his seat by the violent hands of a monk devoted to the bishop. Graystanes tells us, that a savage
<PB N="82" REF="94"/>
from the wilds of Tyndale was brought into the church to do this act; but bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> struck with awe, he retired from the presence of the man, and declared no go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could tempt him to the outrage; yet what the barbarian abhorred, was perp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦trated by one who had professed his obedience to the superior whom he assisted depose. Thus prior Hotoun was put under confinement, and Luceby govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the convent. In this situation affairs remained some time; the prior effected h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> escape into Cleveland, where he remained until the parliament assembled at Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦coln, when he presented a complaint against the prelate, and obtained recom¦mendatory letters from the king for relief at the court of Rome. The prior bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> master of a persuasive eloquence, with much erudition, and a graceful person gained the ear of the pope, and a decree of restitution was pronounced in his fa¦vour, which was published in the church at Durham in the month of April, 130<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Luceby had possession of the prior's apartments, where he retained such friends a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had courage to remain with him; in that situation they meanly descended to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> act of spoiling the vessels belonging the house, stripping off the silver ornaments and taking possession of such plate as fell under their hands; with these attempt¦ing to escape, and being opposed, they threw the valuables over the walls, and stole out by way of the hog-yard. Luceby, whilst he usurped the office, retained many of the principal men of the palatinate in his family, and lived in a splendid manner, that thereby he might win the approbation and esteem of the people; but such measures did not prevail, for many treated him with high contempt. He paid great attention to the sacred edifices; the sacristaria was his first work; he repair∣ed the roof of the nave of the church, built the vestry room, and at a great ex∣pence procured bells, vessels, and ornaments. Graystanes says, he conducted him∣self in the office of prior, both at Holy Island and Durham, with such decorum, that it was the opinion of many, had he come duly to the latter dignity, a better prior <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. de Graystanes.—Whanton's Angl.

<P>In the year 1303, on the day of St Peter <HI>ad Vincula,</HI> prior Hotoun returned to Durham, and was received most cordially by the convent, who held a festival on the occasion: An inquisition was afterwards taken by men of the county of Nor∣thumberland touching the damages sustained by the convent under the bishop's persecution, by the seizure of their revenues and destruction of their parks, in which the bishop employed the most able advocates the kingdom afforded, whilst the prior's cause was managed by one only, whose name was William de Herle, and whom Graystanes perpetuates; when the bishop was justly condemned in a large sum of money. The pope dying soon after, the bishop obtained from his successor a bull, requiring the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of Lincoln and Winchester to visit the chapter of Durham, on an accusation lodged against the prior for dilapidations and divers offences, touching which the prelates were com∣manded
<PB N="83" REF="95"/>
to enquire; but pope Benedict departing this life, the bishop's purpose was frustrated, till pope Clement, who created B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k patriarch of Jerusalem, at his suggestion suspended the prior from all administration, as well in spirituals as tem∣porals. The prior, on his journey to Rome for redress, passed the winter near Canterbury, sending from thence two monks of his convent, as proctors: Whilst he remained there, the bishop committed the care of the monastery to Luceby; and the abbot of Leicester with the pope's mandatory letters accompanied him to Dur∣ham, to give him possession; but on their arrival, they sound the gates shut against them, and their admittance refused; on which, they pronounced an excommuni∣cation against the whole society: This brought on a litigation, at the instance of the prior, for an offence against the crown, on their presuming to execute the powers of the See of Rome in matters temporal, and a grievous sine was imposed upon the offenders.</P>
<P>The prior returned from the South to meet the king at Durham, and on the fes∣tival of St Oswald the martyr, celebrated mass in the royal presence at the altar of St Oswald. The king granted him licence to visit Rome, and recommendatory letters to the pope for redress, with which he passed into Italy, but did not live to return: He met with a favourable reception from the pope and college, and on the 24th of October obtained a sentence of restitution, but was decreed to pay one thousand marks to the apostolical chamber for the same. On the 9th of Jan. (Graystanes says in the year 1307, but from other authorities in 1308) the prior de∣parted this life; and that the See of Rome might be indemnified for the loss of the fine, all his goods, plate, books, horses, and effects then in Italy, were confiscated.</P>
<P>Prior Hotoun was not deficient in public works, notwithstanding the troubles in which he was embarrassed: He compleated the manor-house of Houghhall; with the bishop's licence he purchased Oxford Place, afterwards called Durham College, and made the first erections there <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The account we have of this foundation is, That the monks of Durham might have a receptacle set their novices in the university, as Gloucester had lately obtained before for theirs in Stockwell-street <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> begin to lay their first foundation in Canditch. We read in a certain book, intituled 'Historia Ecclesia Du∣nelmensis et Successio Episcoporum,' that one Hugo de Derlyngton, chosen prior of Durham A.

The witnesses to this, as I find in the original charter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the register here quoted) were, Henry Owen, mayo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; Will. de Wodeston, and Andrew Culbert, provosts; who, I find, were officers of this city about that time.

<PB N="84" REF="96"/>
called Beaurepaire or Bearpark. The convent received a grant of free∣warren in their territories at Winston about this time.</P>
<P>During this prior's office, the dispute which arose between Ralph lord Nevill, of Raby, and the convent, in the time of prior Claxton, was continued, and did not subside for several years. The account we have of it is to the following effect, as given by Dugdale in his Baronage, vol. i. p. 292.</P>
<P>"About the 13 Edw. I. 1285, there was much variance between the inhabitants of the bishopric of Durham and Anthony Beke (that great prelate) then bishop of Durham, by reason he had compelled them to go twice into Scotland with horse and arms, which they alledged to be contrary to right, in regard they held their lands to defend the body of St Cuthbert; and that they ought not, either for king or bishop, to go beyond the rivers of Tyne and Tees. Ralph Nevill, then lord of Ra∣by, was the chief countenancer of those who opposed the bishop. Not long after, another dispute arose between this Ralph and Hugh de Derlyngton then prior of Durham, about the offering of a stag every year upon St Cuthbert's day in Septem∣ber; which (in truth) was rather a rent than an oblation, in regard he held Raby with the eight adjoining townships, by the yearly rent of four pounds and a stag. For contrary to the custom of his ancestors, he not only required, that the prior of Durham, at the offering of the stag, ought to feast him and all the company he should bring, but that the prior's own menial servants should for that time be set aside, and his peculiar servants and officers put in their stead. Whereupon amongst other of his guests he invited John de Baliol of Barnard Castle, who refused to go with him, alledging, that he never knew the Nevills to have such a privilege there; Sir Wm de Brompton, the bishop's chief-justice, likewise acknowledging, that he himself was the first who began that extravagant practice; for being a young man, and delight∣ing in hunting, he came with the lord Nevill at the offering of the stag, and said to his companions, "Come let us go into the abbey and wind our horns," and so they did. The prior farther adding, that before the time of this Ralph, none of his pre∣decessors ever made any such claim, but when they brought the stag into the hall they had only a breakfast; nor did the lord himself ever stay dinner, except he was invited.</P>
<P>In the 5 Edw. III. 1331, Ralph Nevill (son of the former) doing his fealty to William de Couton then prior of Durham, upon Lammas-day, for the manor of Raby, he told him he would offer the stag as his ancestors had done; saving that, whereas his father required, that the prior's servants should be set aside at that time, and his own serve in their stead; he would be content, that his should attend to∣gether with those of the prior: And whereas his father insisted, that his servants should only be admitted at dinner; he stood upon it, that his should be there en∣tertained the whole day, and likewise the morrow at breakfast.</P>
<P>Whereunto the prior made answer, that none of his ancestors were ever so ad∣mitted, and that he would rather quit the stag, than suffer any new custom to the prejudice of the church. But to this Ralph replied, that he would perform the whole service or none, and put the trial of his right upon the country. The prior, therefore, knowing him to be so powerful, and that the country durst not displease him, declined the offer. However, at length to gain his favour, (in regard he had no small interest at court, and might do him a kindness or a dis∣pleasure)
<PB N="85" REF="97"/>
was content for that one time he should perform it as he pleased, so that it might not be drawn into example afterwards; and for that purpose proposed, that indentures should be made between them.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Lord, Nevill brought but few with him, and those more for the honour of the prior than a burthen, and so shortly after dinner took his leave, but left one of his servants to lodge there all night, and to take his breakfast there on the next day; protesting, that being both a son and tenant to the church, he would not be burthensome to it, in respect it would be no advantage to himself, but might much damnify it, if he should bring with him as great a train as he would, saying, <HI>What doth a breakfast signify to me? Nothing.</HI> And likewise, that if the prior would shew, that he had no right to what he so claimed, he would free∣ly recede therefrom; and if he had a right, he would accept of a composition for it, rather than be burthensome to the convent; but if they should put him to get his right by law, then he would not abate any thing thereof.</P>
<P>Whereupon enquiry being made amongst the oldest monks of the house, they affirmed, that being of eight years standing when his father was before repulsed, they had often seen the stag offered, and that he never staid dinner but when the prior invited him; and some ancient men of the country testified as much; as al∣so, that as soon as the stag was brought, they carried him to the kitchen, and those who brought him were taken into the hall to breakfast, as they that brought their rents used to be.</P>
<P>Moreover, when it happened that any of the lords Nevill were desired to stay dinner with the prior, his cook was admitted into the kitchen to prepare a dish for him; so likewise another servant in the cellar to chuse his drink, and in like manner some other at the gate, who knew his servants and followers, merely to let them in, and keep others out, who, under pretence of being his servants, might then intrude; but this was only done by the prior out of courtesy and respect, and not at all of right.</P>
<P>Hereupon Henry le Scrope, one of the justices, affirmed, that he had been of counsel with Ralph Nevill (father of this Ralph) when he brought his writ of <HI>Novell Disseisin</HI> against the prior; and told him that he had no right at all: Where∣upon Ralph let fall his suit.</P>
<P>Some said, that making this claim out of his own see, he ought there, (viz. in the priory) to shew some special evidence to assert his claim. Others, that as the prior did challenge nothing of him, but what was reserved by the grant; so could not he, unless he shewed a charter for it. And besides, claiming to be entertained with as many as he should bring, and not specifying the number, there could be no lawful reason for it; because the stag was always offered on Holy Rood day, whereupon grew an old song in rhyme, as a lamentation for Robert de Nevill, his great grandfather.</P>

<P><PB N="86" REF="98"/>Moreover, it was further said, that it never had been the custom of the prior to make a feast on that day, when the servants of so great a person was to offer; and that the prior usually on St Cuthbert's day had wont to dine with the bishop at some of his own manor-houses; therefore, who should compel him to make a feast at home? Likewise, that those lands were given to the ancestors of this lord Nevill, when they were not such great men as to have a marshal, a butler, and other servants of state; for in those days, they had no more than Raby with its appurte∣nances, which was not then of so much worth as it is now; for Brancepeth and Ras∣kelfe came to them since by marriage; as also other lands in Yorkshire and Rich∣mondshire: Therefore it could not be thought that the prior of Durham did give lands of such value, and purchase the service to be done for them at so high a rate, especially considering, that in the prior's land book, not only all the services are exactly registered, but whatsoever others ought to receive of him. And lastly, that there is not so much as mention made of this service in any of their chroni∣cles."</P>
<P>During the vacancy of the priory, the bishop seized the temporalties of the con∣vent, and by Stephen Mauley (de Malo-lacu) his vicar-general, displaced the sub∣prior, the priors of the cells, and many who were adherents of the deceased prior, appointing others in their places: The prior of Coldingham alone was continued in his office. This Graystanes exclaims against as a flagrant breach of the privileges of the convent, though the bishop alledged the members of the house were not ca∣pable of holding offices, by reason of the sentence of excommunication, which re∣mained unpurged. In this period much perplexity arose touching presentations to vacant churches, till it was determined they should be made jointly, under the title of <HI>Anthony bishop of Durham and the convent of Durham, the office of prior being va∣cant.</HI> In the year 1308, on the morrow of the Purification, the bishop visited the chapter in the order prescribed by pope Boniface, when, for no other irregularity or offence than their attachment to the prior in his struggles against the prelate's oppressions, he suspended the following members of the society for ten years:— Richard de Aslakby, who was sub-prior in prior Hotoun's time; Galfridus de Bur∣don, prior of Finchale; and Nicholas de Rothbury, almoner of Durham. But archbishop Greenfield, in his visitation during the vacancy of the See, after the prelate's death, annulled the sentence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Wharton's Angl.

<P>then prior of Wederhall, and he was accordingly appointed Hotoun's successor on the 24th of February, 1308: In this act we have a flagrant instance of the corrup∣tion of the holy See; for the price of his collation was not less than 3000 marks to the pontiff, and 1000 to the cardinals. He was installed on the feast of St Cuthbert in September following, many of the nobility with several prelates be∣ing present at the ceremony.</P>
<P>Under the oppressive spirit of the prelate, the priory suffered greatly; being not
<PB N="87" REF="99"/>
only much impoverished by the expences incurred, and heavy debt contracted on account of their litigations with him; but also greatly embarrassed and distressed by the defection of the prior of Coldingham, who renounced his obedience and subjection to the monastery: The prior of Durham visited that convent, and dis∣placed the prior for his offence, appointing another in his room: After having re∣ceived the homage and fealty of the terr-tenants of the shrine, he followed the de∣posed prior to Stamford, whither he hastened to lay his complaint before the par∣liament, hoping the king and his ministers would support him against his superior, as he was personally known to them, having carried the banner of St Cuthbert in the Scotch war; but in this was disappointed, for the countenance of the court was denied to such injurious proceedings.</P>
<P>The prior of Durham obtained permission to visit Rome, where he staid till the prelate's death. On the accession of bishop Kellow, the convent experienced a happy change of circumstances, and received repeated marks of that prelate's coun∣tenance and favour; he reversed all the oppressive acts of his predecessor, and re∣stored the ancient privileges of the monastery, especially in the material point, that during the vacancy of the priory, none save the sub-prior and chapter should intermeddle with the spiritualties or temporalties of the convent; the bishop re∣taining to the See the right of having one clerk in the house as a nominal guardian thereof, with three horses and three servants, without claiming to have any further concern with the goods of the house. By the gift of this prelate, the convent had Wastrophead, with a fishery in the river Were.</P>
<P>In the year 1313 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">R. de Graystanes.—Wharton's Angl.

<P>formerly a monk of Durham, and prior of the monastery of Weremouth, who was elected the 16th of March, 1342, and confirmed and installed on the last day of the same month: Chambrè speaking of him, says, he was a man of much wisdom, with a prevailing eloquence, so that many took the habit in his time <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Chambrè.—Wharton, p. 767.— Grey's MS. Notes.</NOTE>: He caused an account to be had of the goods and possessions of the monastery, for the better management and protection thereof; and appointed a burser of great providence and discretion, by whose care and assiduity, during the course of six years, 758 l. 3 s. 6 d. of the old debts of the convent were discharged, 492l. 7s. 7d. was ex∣pended out of the treasury in public works, and 209l. 5s. 3d. in contributions: He caused all the missals of the church to be removed, one of which, lying at the altar of St Nicholas and St Giles, cost him 22 l. At the north end of the middle tran∣sept of the cathedral church, he made a large window of six lights, with three lesser windows, near the altar of St Nicholas and St Giles, which was the third and last altar in that aile to the north, in the masonry of which he expended 100 l. and 25 l. in glazing. Stevens seems to confound Chambrè's account <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 35<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; and the great window made by our prior is named twice, saying, he made another large and sumptuous window of six lights, whereas on a view of the church the error is easily discovered. He ordained, with consent of the chapter, that a daily mass should be said for his soul at the abovementioned altar by one monk, for whose pension, with the maintenance of the windows, and for provision for his anniversary, he appro∣priated lands to the convent. He provided a rich vestment with three copes, for the ceremonies of his anniversary. He instituted a chantry at the aforesaid altar, which was called <HI>the chantry of the Holy Trinity,</HI> for the celebration of divine service for ever; and under the bishop's licence purchased lands in North Pittington, Wol∣viston,

He expended in other edifices and ornaments about the church 402l. 6s. 8d. and made a window at the south end of the common hall, which cost him 40l. In his time many reparations and new works were made, as well within the church as without, particularly in the kiln <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Torrale.—Chambrè.—Wharton, p. 768.</NOTE>, granary, and kitchen, the great window of seven lights at the west end of the nave, three other windows in the north side of the nave, two on the north side of the choir by John de Tickhill, and two on the south by the feretory: Also, in this prior's time, the lord Ralph Nevill presented to the church a vestment of red velvet, and obtained permission that he and his lady Alicia should be buried within the walls of the church, which had not been granted before to a layman. John lord Nevill his son, at the instance of Ri∣chard de Birtley and John de Cornvall, then feretraries of the church, caused to be made a new work of marble and alabaster for St Cuthbert's tomb, which cost up∣wards of 200l. and at the prior's request, the elegant tabernacle work, which di∣vides the feretory from the high altar, was procured, towards the expence of which lord Nevill gave 600 marks. It was made in London, and sent down by sea; but before our munificent prior could see it erected, attacked by various infirmities, he departed this life at Beaurepaire, on the 12th day of November, in the 90th year of his age, and 33d of his priorship, A.

To this the prior, with the assent of the convent, replied, that he would not consent on any consideration to the infringe∣ment of any of the privileges of his church; but that the sacrist should have the cha∣riot, horses, and all the vestments, with which the remains should enter the north gate, together with the chapel, and all other the episcopal ornaments used at the in∣terment. The lord Nevill and four others of distinction were chosen to determine upon this claim; who adjudged, that by ancient custom all these matters appertained to, and were the right of the church; but they compromised the same in the present instance, and the executors consented to pay 200l. in lieu of the articles demanded, in order that the splendor of the interment might not be diminished, or the intended ceremony disturbed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>O ineffabilis miseria hujus mundi!

in Copeland, in the county of Cumberland, was educated in St John's college, Cambridge, where he commenced doctor in divinity, and went out <HI>ad eundem</HI> 9th July 1567. It is said he was nominated to the bishopric of Durham in 1552, bishop Tunstall being then living, who declined accepting it, as the conditions were such he could not approve: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grey's Notes.—Kennet's Hist. vol. ii. p. 323.—Burnet's Res. vol. ii. p. 64.—Strype's Ann. vol. ii. p. 656.</NOTE> It is certain there was much disagreement between him and that prelate. Soon after the accession of queen Mary, Horn was ejected, and became a voluntary exile for the cause of faith, living abroad the whole of her reign. At the head of the episcopal party at Frankfort he greatly distinguished himself, be∣ing chosen Hebrew-reader to the English society there <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Ch. Hist. lib. 8, p. 31.</NOTE>. In a bitter contest with one Ashley, his bigotry rather than his tolerant spirit was displayed <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib 8, p. 32.</NOTE>. On the ac∣cession of Elizabeth, being restored to his deanry, he continued but a short time be∣fore his appointment to the bishopric of Winchester, which happened in the year 1560. At the conference at Westminster, he was chosen one of the disputants con∣cerning the services of the church <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. 9, p. 56.</NOTE>. A suit was prosecuted against him by bishop Bonner, touching the supremacy oath<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 79.—Collyer's Eccl. Hist. vol. ii. p. 493.</NOTE>, which was superseded by the fortunate in∣terposition of the statute on consecrations. He departed this life on the 1st day of June 1579. The place of his interment is variously spoken of; most probably it was in the church at Winchester, near the pulpit; but Willis and Stevens say in the Minories church, London. The inscription on his tomb has been given us in the History of Winchester, published in 1773 <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Robertus Horne, theologiae doctor eximius, quondam Christi causae exul, deinde episcopus Winton, pie obiit in Domino June 1, 1580, episcopatus sui anno 19.</NOTE>.

<P>WHEREAS the late noble prince of famous memory, king Henry the Eighth, father to our most gratious so∣veraigne lady the queene, amongst other his godly acts and doings, did erect, make and establish divers and sun∣dry churches, as well cathedral as collegiate, and endowed every of the same with divers manors, lands, tene∣ments and possessions, for the maintenance of the deanes, prebendaries and ministers within the same, and for other charitable acts to be done and executed by the same deanes, prebendaries and ministers: And also did incorporate the same deanes, prebendaries and ministers, and made them <HI>bodyes politique in perpetual succession,</HI> according to the lawes of the realme of England.</P>
<P>And where also, as the late kinge, for the better maintenance and preservation of the said churches, in a godly unity and good order and governance, graunted unto the several corporations and bodyes corporate of every of the said churches that they should be ruled and governed for ever, according unto certaine ordinan∣ces, rules and statutes, to be specifyed in certaine indentures then after to be made by his highnes, and to be delivered and declared to every of the bodyes corporate of the said several churches, as by the several erections and foundations of the said churches more plainly it doth and may appear: Since which said erec∣tions and foundations, the said late kinge did cause to be delivered to every of the said churches, so as is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esaid erected and incorporated, by certaine commissioners by his highnes appointed, diverse and sundrye statutes and ordinances, made and declared by the same commissioners, for the order, rule and governance of the said several churches, and of the deanes, prebendaries and ministers of the same; which said statutes and ordinances were made by the said commissioners, and delivered unto every of the corporations of the said se∣veral churches in writinge, but not indented, according to the forme of the said foundations and erections, by reason whereof, the said churches, and the several deanes, prebendaries and ministers of the same, have no statutes or ordinances of any force or authority, whereby they should be ruled and governed, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as yet not fully established, in such sort as the godly intent of the said late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Henry the Eighth was, to the greate imperfection of the same churches, and the hinderance of God's service, and good order and regiment to be had and continued amongst the ministers of the same.</P>

with the whole choir in their proper habits, shall meet him in procession at the north door, the bells ringing, the dean on his right-hand, the next in dignity on his left, conducting him to the high altar, where, kneeling, the prayers prescribed shall be used. He is to be received in the same manner when he comes to visit; but on other occasions by the ringing of bells, and without procession. When the bishop preaches, or performs divine service, the person whose turn it should be, is excused. On his reading any of the offices on great festivals, the dean on his right-hand, and the person next in dignity on his left; or, in their absence, the two next superiors shall assist, and attend him from the vestry to the altar or the throne; and on other occasions the sub-dean, or the person next in dignity, shall minister to him and support his book. The dean and the whole choir, coming in or going out, shall bow to him, whether he is seated in his stall or throne.

<P>The dean is to be installed and placed in his seat in the chapter-house by the sub∣dean or senior residentiary, where, having taken the prescribed oath, both major and minor canons shall promise canonical obedience to him in these words: <HI>Domine decane, promitto tibi canonicam obedientiam tanquam decano.</HI> The dean's power and jurisdiction is supreme, touching the government of the church. He shall hear all causes relative to the chapter, and, assisted with their opinions, determine therein; correct excesses, and reprehend all obstinate offenders. He shall invest the preben∣daries in the presence of their brethren, and in his and the chapter's name receive the oath prescribed. Being superior in authority, all shall stand when he enters or departs the choir or chapter-house. He is first in place and voice. The ringing of the bells must wait for him morning and evening on festivals, when he is to perform the offices; but not at other times, unless he officiates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nisi cum executor officii suerit.</NOTE>. On the like days he is to chant the anthems, or such of the canons as he shall appoint for that purpose. On reading the service he is not to quit his seat. If the bishop is not present, it is the dean's office, or, in his absence, the next in dignity, to pronounce the confession. All the ministers of the church shall bow to him in his stall as they enter or depart the choir. In correcting excesses, such is the prerogative of the dean and prebenda∣ries, on account of their prebends, that they shall not be convened out of chapter, because such causes as relate to the prebends shall be determined in chapter, by the judgment of the dean and chapter. Prebendaries' servants ought to be corrected by their proper masters, unless their offences are heinous, and their masters neglect that duty. Leave of absence shall be given by the dean to the minor canons and other officers of the church for one day, or at most not exceeding eight days; and in his absence, by the sub-dean or senior resident: Absence for any greater time shall not be given without consent of the chapter.</P>

Every residentiary who holds residence for the whole year, shall twice a year entertain the whole choir, and the eight poor men belonging to the church at different times, not more than six together <HI>et semel tantum in die.</HI> But if he is not resident the whole year, then it shall suffice that he entertains the choir only once a year, in manner before mentioned. If any one is invited and doth not come, the residentiary is excused asking him again; for whoever is invited is pre∣sumed to be at the table. Those that neglect the performance of any of these ordinances may be punished by the dean, or in his absence by the sub-dean, by withholding the monthly allowance, or by an arbitrary mulct. As to the three al∣lowed to hold residence together, they shall all be present; unless on some urgent occasion one is obliged to be absent, and that not above ten days: And they shall keep their table at a joint expence, otherwise they shall not be deemed as one re∣sidentiary, except only where any of them is so ill he cannot possibly attend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Morbo laboret soatico,</HI> morbus sonticus, verbum Plinii.—A grievous, dangerous disease, such as in the Roman laws was sufficient excuse for non-appearance.</NOTE>.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI>—The Dean and Prebendaries' Stipends.</HEAD>
<P>That the dean and prebendaries may be better enabled to keep hospitality, the dean shall annually receive from the treasurer <HI>pro corpore decanatus,</HI> 40l. 1s. 3d. and each prebendary 8l. 4s. 9¼d. The dean shall further receive from the trea∣surer for every day he attends prayers morning and evening, and the statutable days of absence 12s. 5d. and each prebendary 16¼ d. Those are deemed to be present at prayers who come into church before the end of the first psalm, and do not depart (but on urgent necessity) before the service is concluded. All stipends

On the death or removal of the dean or prebendaries, from the day of that event to Michaelmas next following, the profits of the corps lands, &amp;c. and all moveables, shall be at his, or his executors disposal. If any such prebendary doth not reside, and keep hospitality, the dean, with the consent of the chapter, may let the lands, &amp;c. so assigned from year to year and at will; so that the said prebendary or his successor afterwards keeping residence, may not be deprived of the profits of those lands, &amp;c. longer than a year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>Here is no mention made of the stipends or dividends belonging to the executor of the deceased till Michaelmas; and therefore according to the 16 Cha. they are to be divided <HI>a vacatione</HI> from the time of his death, <HI>inter residentes,</HI> though before he died he kept the twenty-one days residence: But if he did not keep residence, his stipends and share of the dividends belong to the rest.

<P>The answer of the dean and prebendaries to Bishop Cosin's articles of inquiry in his second visitation, A. D. 1665.</P>
<P>For the houses of the petty canons we certified your lordship in your first visitation, that they were all in these late bad times destroyed. That they were formerly but little houses or chambers, made only for un∣married persons, and who had their diet in common. That we had already made their places better than when they had their old houses and stipends: to which notwithstanding, we have of our own accord, and upon public cost, added so much, that we hope in a little time, to see three good houses built for them this year, and have sound out a good way for supply of a fourth; and as soon as Mr Dury can be removed, of a fifth also, though with some charges to repair this. The petty canons'-hall and the guest-hall, since the method of hospitality and diet were changed, were of long time useless and ruined in these last destructive times: But yet our design is, by some reparation of walls, to render the place of the petty canons'-hall more seemly. We found no school-house standing, but have built a large one, with addition of divers rooms. In this article it appears, that the second, sixth, eighth, and ninth prebend houses were a little before rebuilt in whole, or great part.</P>
<P>One of Bishop Cosin's injunctions at the close of his visitation, 1668, was, that no one should carry any thing through the church; but that victuals, or any thing of that sort should be seized, and carried to the gaol, to be distributed among the prisoners.</P>
<P>It appears both by the visitation papers of Bishop Cosin and Bishop Crewe, that <HI>sackbuts</HI> and <HI>cornets</HI> were then used in the church music.</P></NOTE>. It belongs also to the treasurer to attend to the re∣pairs of the houses belonging to the chapter within the city of Durham; which re∣pairs shall be made between the 1st day of March and Michaelmas, according to the dean or sub-dean's orders; and not later in the year, unless in cases of great neces∣sity, and where, in the dean's judgment, delay would be materially detrimental. Bills for repairs and other affairs of the church shall not be allowed, unless the dean, or, he being absent and not objecting, the sub-dean shall certify the same. The treasurer shall have charge of the plate, vestments, and muniments, least the sacrist should be negligent; and shall examine them every quarter with the re∣gister, &amp;c. that nothing be wanting.

<P>First, to the bridge lying in the West Oxes Pasture, in the way to South-Sheels, forty shillings.—Item, to the causeway at Nevill's Cross, twenty shillings.—Item, to the Waiste nigh the east end of Framwellgate bridge, the ground is in decay, thirteen shillings and four-pence.—Item, to the high street in Southfield to Darlington, on this side Cotton Mundeville from the old causeway, northward about three hundred yards, forty shillings.—Item, to the street in the North Bailey, called Kingsgate, as it lieth down by the North Bailey church-yard, to the postern there, ten shillings. — Item, to the highway up Crossgate, towards Nevill's Cross, twenty shillings — Item, to the highway at Newbridge end, from the causeway there to the causeway lately made at the bank side towards Barns, one pound six shillings and eight-pence.—Item, to the highway towards St Oswald's church, on the far side of the water, thirteen shillings and four-pence.— Item, to the stairs of Mount Bath, thirteen shillings and four-pence.—Item, to the causeways in Rainton lane, six pounds thirteen shillings and four-pence. —Item, to Burdon Wood bridge, two pounds six shillings and eight-pence.—To Hedworth bridge, one pound.

To Wolsingham bridge, and other places within the county and bishopric of Durham, where greatest need is, eight pounds nineteen shillings and five-pence farthing.—And further the said jurors cannot find upon this article.</P>
<P>☞ As the county rates run exceedingly high, this seems to be a fit subject of enquiry by the justices in session, whether this twenty pounds has been duly applied of late years, for the benefit of the county at large; it being apprehended to be solely appropriated by the chapter to their new bridge at Durham, which they will not allow to be a public carriage bridge.</P></NOTE>, is to be expended

The visitor is prohibited making any new statutes, <HI>(hiisce statutis contraria)</HI> and shall not dispense with any of them. The dean and prebendaries are prohibited receiving any new statutes made by others, or any dispensations, under the pains of perjury and loss of their prefer∣ments for ever.

<HEAD><HI>An Act of Chapter,</HI> 20 <HI>July,</HI> 1556.</HEAD>
<P>Considering that this our church, during the late schism, has been spoiled of all its ornaments and much wasted; and moreover, that a very small stipend is assigned by the statutes to the ministers of this church, to alleviate which, we the dean and chapter, by common and unanimous consent, this 20th day of July, in the year of our Saviour 1556, in a general chapter held at Durham, have ordained and de∣creed, that whoever after this day shall be admitted into the place of canon or pre∣bendary of this church, however becoming vacant before he be installed, is to pay the precentor three shillings and four-pence; the register six shillings and eight-pence; the two vergers four shillings; for bread and wine five shillings; to the bell-ringers one shilling; the chapter of the resident prebendaries one pound; to the fabric and ornaments of the church one pound: And this we will to be ob∣served as a local statute of the church for ever.</P>
<P>The stipends are then stated, as before noted in the 33d chapter, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Analecta Capitularia Ex Archivis Dunelm.</HI> An account of the practices of the church, about the lands and tithes, commonly called <HI>corps</HI> and <HI>bycorps,</HI> lotteries, dividends, residences, &amp;c. since the erection of the deanry: Extracted out of the register-books and rentals, &amp;c. supposed to be collected by Dr Basire. The original signed P. Smith, register.</P>
<P>It has been the custom since the erection, to call the lands assigned to the dean and prebendaries for augmentation of residence and hospitality their corps; al∣though in our local statutes the yearly stipend of the dean is said to be given him <HI>pro corpore decanatus sui,</HI> and of the prebendaries <HI>pro corpore prebendae suae;</HI> the word <HI>corps</HI> being used herein not otherwise, nor <HI>bycorps</HI> at all.</P>
<P>Our statutes were made by Queen Mary, in the first year of her reign, she being enabled thereto by an act of parliament. The former statutes by King Henry VIII. being defective, as in other things, so in point of law, as appears by the preamble of that act. We have, I suppose, no copy of the old statutes, but by some passages in our books, we may think they did not differ much from the new, in the matter of corps, and some other particulars: Bishop Tunstall having, as it is probable, a great hand in both; and there is a traditional commendation of him for the good service he did the church concerning the statutes.</P>
<P>But searching into the practice, we find these corps not so disposed of for a good while as they are now. At the erection of the deanry, although their corps with other lands, were settled upon the dean and prebendaries, they came not all of them into their hands at the same time, the prior and convent had leased out some, as Houghhall and Witton-Gilbert, for forty years, and South Pittington for thirty-five years, some two years before the dissolution; for if it had been but one year before, the leases had been void by an act of parliament. And King Henry VIII. in the interval between the dissolution and erection, had made a grant of more of them to several persons for twenty-one years, &amp;c.</P>

Oxon. v. i. 2 edit. p. 57.</NOTE>: Having become bachelor of arts, he was elected fellow of All-Souls', in 1545: And two years afterwards, was made one of the seniors of Christ-Church, on its foundation by K. Henry VIII. who endeavoured to re∣plenish the same with the first scholars of the university. On the 17th of May, 1550, having obtained leave to travel for three years, his time was spent chiefly at the university of Orleans, where he married the daughter of Lewis Jacquiene<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gray's notes, MSS. He married the sister of John Calvin.</NOTE>. He returned to England in the latter end of the reign of K. Edward VI. but on the accession of Q. Mary, was one of the fugitives to Frankfort, and afterwards be∣came a member of the church of Geneva: On John Knox's leaving that society, to return to Scotland, Whittingham was prevailed upon by Calvin to become a mini∣ster of the church: He engaged, with other learned men of that society, in an English translation of the Bible; but it was not finished before several of those em∣ployed therein returned to England, on Q. Elizabeth coming to the crown: Whit∣tingham remained near eighteen months at Geneva, to perfect the work; during which time, he reduced into metre five of David's psalms, (inscribed W. W.) of which the 119th was one; together with the ten commandments, and a prayer, now placed at the end of the version. Soon after his return to England, he was employed to accompany Francis, earl of Bedford, on his embassy of condolence for the death of the French king, in 1560: And he attended Ambrose, earl of War∣wick, to Newhaven, to be preacher there, whilst the earl defended it against the French; on which occasion he shewed a reproachable disposition, in spiriting the people against uniformity: The earl, either to be rid of him, or through an esteem, which even his improprieties could not wean, obtained this deanry of the queen, on Skynner's death, although the same had been promised by her majesty to Dr Wilson, then one of her secretaries of state. Whittingham enjoyed the deanry sixteen years; was a violent opposer of measures touching the sacerdotal vesture, and used all his influence with the earl of Leicester therein; supporting Bishop Pilkingtru's
<PB N="144" REF="156"/>
arguments to the utmost of his power: He wrote to the earl, and, as Collier ob∣serves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl.

<P>Notwithstanding all applications to the contrary, the order touching sacerdotal vestments issued in 1564<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See a succinct account in Collier's Eccl. Hist. v. ii. p. 495.</NOTE>, and was urged in such a manner, that they that refused the same were not permitted to exercise their ministry; on which the dean sub∣mitted thereto. It was not long before he was severely upbraided, for this com∣pliance, by one who was with him at Geneva: But finding an apt reply, answering, that he and others knew, and had heard John Calvin say, <Q><HI>That for external matters of order, they might not neglect their ministry,</HI> for so should they, for tithing of mint, neglect the greater things of the law.</Q> He was a great advocate for sing∣ing in the church, and provided the best anthems used in the queen's chapel, being himself skilful in music <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>For the same degree (bachelor of divinity, 22d March 1566) did William Whittingham, M.

But that church refused his visitation; which caused a contest between the said church and the archbishop, which proceeded even to an excommunication: And for the better searching into the merits of the cause, and for putting some good conclusion to this difference, a commission was at length, by the lord-keeper, issued out, to some persons to hear it <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Strype Ann. v. ii. p. 181.</NOTE>.</Q>— This commission we have in Rymer's Foedera, vol. xv. p. 785, dated 14th of May, 1578.

<P>Dean Whittingham was guilty of much profanation on the pious monuments and sacred remains in this church. The account given by Wood <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ath. Oxon. v. i. p. 154.</NOTE>, of those acts of violence and irreligion, is shortly stated to the reader; but antecedent thereto, we beg leave to observe, that in all ages, and with all people, where civilization and the true spirit of religion prevailed, things applied to pious offices and religious ceremonies were held in such veneration, that defiling and employing them in mean and contemptuous uses, was forbidden and punished. The example of Balthazar, in holy writ, is tremendous; though the superstitious rites of the Jewish temple might render the vessels he abused, as odious to those who stripped them from the sacred places, as ever dean Whittingham held the vessels of the church at Durham. Disturbing the ashes of the dead, is an offence to human nature, such as the most ignorant of savages refrain from; polished nations of antiquity held such remains in the highest veneration, and did not conceive the most depraved mind capable of their profanation: The Egyptian who left his father's corps unredeem∣ed, was denied the privileges of society. In profane history, the story of Cambyses affords us reflections of the like nature. The learned Dr Prideaux is a sufficient authority to quote this instance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prideaux's Connection, &amp;c. v. i. p. 244.</NOTE>; and his words are, <Q>As he mounted his horse for the march, his sword falling out of the scabbard, gave him a wound on the thigh, of which he died a few days after. The Egyptians remarking, that it was in the same part of the body, where he had afore wounded the Apis, reckoned it as an especial judgment from Heaven upon him, for that fact, <HI>and perchance they were not much out of it: For it seldom happening, in an affront given to any particular mode of worship, how erroneous soever it may be, but that religion is in general wound∣ed thereby; there are many instances in history, wherein God hath very signally punished the profanations of religion in the worst of times, and under the worst mode of heathen idolatry.</HI>" Wood proceeds thus, "The works of impiety that Whit∣tingham performed, while he sat dean of Durham, were very many, among
<PB N="146" REF="158"/>
which I shall tell you of these. Most of the priors of Durham having been buried in coffins of stone, and some in marble, and each coffin covered with a plank of marble, or free stone, which lay level with the paving of the church, (for ancient∣ly men of note that were laid in such coffins, were buried no deeper in the ground than the breadth of a plank to be laid over them, even with the surface of the pave∣ment) he caused some of them to be plucked up, and appointed them to be used as troughs, for horses to drink in, or hogs to feed in. All the marble and free stones also that covered them, and other graves, he caused to be taken away and broken, some of which served to make pavement in his house. He also defaced all such stones as had any pictures of brass, or other imagery work, or chalice wrought, engraven upon them; and the residue he took away and em∣ployed them to his own use, and did make a washing house of them, at the end of the centery garth; so that it could not be discerned afterwards that ever any were buried in the said centery garth, it was so plain and straight. The truth is, <HI>he could not abide any thing that appertained to a goodly religiousness, or monastical life</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davies' Rites and Monuments.—This book was written by Anon. (one that had belonged to the choir of Durham), and published by John Davies of Kidwelly, in 1672.</NOTE>. Within the said abbey church of Durham, were two holy-water stones, of fine marble, very artificially made and engraven, and bossed with hollow bosses, upon the outersides of the stones, very curiously wrought. They were both of the same work, but one much greater than the other. Both these were taken away by this <HI>unworthy dean,</HI> and carried into his kitchen, and employed to profane uses by his servants, steeping their beef and salt fish in them, having a con∣veyance in the bottoms of them, to let forth the water, as they had when they were in the church, to let out holy-water, &amp;c. He also caused the image of St Cuthbert, (which before had been removed from its proper place by dean Robert Horn, who also had a hand in such impieties) and also other ancient monuments to be defaced and broken all to pieces, to the intent that there should be no memory of that holy man, or of any other who had been famous in the church, and great benefactors thereto, (as the priors his predecessors were) left whole and undefaced. I say it again, that he did this to the end, that no memory or token of that holy man, St Cuthbert, should be left, who was sent and brought thither by the power and will of Almighty God, and was thereupon the oc∣casion of the erection of the monastical church of Durham, where the clergy and servants have all their livings and commodities from that time to this day. At length, after his many rambles in this world, both beyond and within the seas, and his too forward zeal for promoting his Calvinistical (if not worse) opinions, whereby much mischief happened to the church of England, he did unwillingly (being then full of worldly troubles) submit himself to the stroke of death, on the 10th day of June, 1579, and was buried in the cathedral church of Durham; soon after was a tomb-stone laid over his grave, with an epitaph of twelve long and short verses, engraven on a brass plate, fastened thereto; which, with most, if not all of the monuments, which were set up after his time, were miserably defaced by the Scots, when they invaded England, in 1640. So that as he had
<PB N="147" REF="159"/>
before in a woeful manner, violated the monuments of his predecessors and others, so was his, by invaders; and nothing now left to preserve his memory, or person to shew the place where his carcase was lodged.</Q> After what Wood has said of our dean, it is justice to his character to gather up the sentiments of other authors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<BIBL>Ward's Reformation, cant. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. <Q>The Lord Burleigh being advanced to the white staff, his place of secretary of state, if we believe A. Wood, was likely to be given to dean Whit∣tingham, so noted a Puritan, that he has many an ill word from that Oxonian, who however says of him, had he stirred in it, and made interest with his friend Robert, earl of Leicester, he might have obtained it.</Q> Bancroft, another such rigid doctor as Whitgift, in a treatise of his, stiles Whittingham <Q><HI>the false, un∣worthy dean of Durham,</HI> for taking upon him that deanry, when he was only master of arts, and, by the statutes of the church at Durham, he should have been a doctor or bachelor of divinity: With such straws are these men's heads stuffed. It gave also great offence, that he should content himself with a Geneva ordi∣nation, and for this they did not forbear injuring him, in saying he encouraged Knox and Goodman, in setting up sedition in Scotland; for the settlement made by Knox in Scotland, was the reformed religion, and not sedition. Dr Sandys, now archbishop of York, suspecting that the gentle hand of Dr Pilkington, late bishop of Durham, had given the Puritans too much encouragement in that diocese, resolved to visit it himself, Dr Barnes, the new bishop, having complain∣ed to him, of the number of non-conformists, whom he could not reduce to the orders of the church. But whatever his pretence was for this grand visitation, the real design was supposed to be against Whittingham, whom Sandys valued not the more for having been a fellow exile with him in Germany, in the bloody reign of queen Mary. He was a divine of great learning, an admirer of Calvin and the church of Geneva, which the late honourable and reverend Dr Compton, bishop of London, stiled his brethren, in a letter he wrote to them, and which the Laudeans treat with contempt or indignation, as schismatics. It seems dean Whittingham had only had Geneva ordination, which I believe as much, as that the sun is now shining in a very fine day, is by the bulk of the inferior clergy, and younger academics, at this time looked upon to be no more an ordination than that of a vestry would be. There were thirty-four other articles against him; but that was like an ignorant rustic's insisting to have a fellow hanged for stealing his goose, when he had just been convicted of burglary: The latter was sufficient to hang him, and the goose afterwards not worth mentioning. If he was no priest, as archbishop Sandys urged, on account of his foreign ordination, that would have outed him of course, and then what signified the other roll of articles: But the dean, instead of answering the charge, stood by the rights of the church of Durham, and denied the archbishop's power of visitation; upon which
<PB N="148" REF="160"/>
the archbishop excommunicated him, that is, denied him the privilege and benefit of receiving the Lord's supper. The dean appealed to the queen, who directed a commission to the archbishop, to the lord president of the North, and to the dean of York, to hear and determine the validity of his orders, and to enquire into the other misdemeanors contained in the articles: The lord presi∣dent was a favourer of the Puritans, and Dr Hutton, dean of York, of Whit∣tingham's principles, and boldly averred, that the dean was ordained in a better sort than even the archbishop himself; so that the commission came to nothing. Sandys, vexed at the disappointment, and at calling in question his right of visi∣tation, the reader sees how it goes, the power, the denomination, the self ever uppermost, obtained another commission, directed to himself, to the bishop of Durham, the lord president, (he must come after notwithstanding his precedency) the chancellor of the diocese, and some others, whom he could depend upon, to visit the church of Durham: The aim of Sandys and Barnes was to deprive Whittingham of his deanry, as a layman. When the dean appeared before the commissioners, he produced a certificate under the hands of eight persons, for the manner of his ordination; upon which the lord president rose up, and said, I cannot in conscience agree to deprive him for that cause only, for it will be ill taken by all the godly and learned, both at home and abroad, that we should allow of the popish massing priests in our ministry, and disallow of ministers made in a reformed church; upon which the commission was adjourned <HI>sine die.</HI>— One cannot help observing here, how the noble and the wise abhorred persecu∣tion, and how enlarged their minds were in comparison with the lordly eccle∣siastics. These proceedings of the archbishop against the dean were invidious, and lost him his esteem, both in city and county. Besides the calling the dean's ordination in question, was contrary to the statute 13th Elizabeth, by which the ordinations of foreign reformed churches were declared valid; and those that had no other orders, were made of like capacities with others, to enjoy any place of ministry within England. It is strange the archbishop of York, and the bishop of Durham, among other articles against the dean, did not think of that mentioned by Wood, the Oxonian, who doubtless thought it of the highest im∣portance, which was, that he was only graduated master of arts, whereas the statutes of the church of Durham required, that the dean should be a bachelor of divinity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. v. p. 120.</NOTE>. What trifles do they hoard up for treasures! He is charged with hor∣rid impieties by Wood, &amp;c. &amp;c. sure I am that all these, and other the like im∣pieties, as the Oxonian calls them, are in no degree so impious, as what himself says of that idolatrous monk Cuthbert's being brought to Durham, by the power and will of Almighty God, to set up a church full of idols, and priests almost as stupid as the wooden images they worshipped <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gyll's Notes and MSS. penes G.

Strype speaks of him thus<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ann. vol. ii. p. 347.</NOTE>:—<Q>A great preacher, and a pious, holy man: This venerable prelate first entered into orders by the motion and counsel of Dr Calfhill, a learned dignitary of the church in those times, and his cousin; though his father and mother, persons of good quality, who seemed to be dis∣affected to religion, were not inclinable thereto, as I have seen in a letter of the said Calfhill, soon after written to Sir William Cecil, <HI>That he was bound by all honest means to prefer his cousin, as well in respect of his rare abilities, as also for that he had followed his advice, in entering into the ministry, against the good will of father and mother, and other his able friends.</HI> Matthew was soon sent for to court by the earl of Leicester, having been recommended to him by his said kinsman; as also the said secretary Cecil, who by soliciting the queen, obtained for him the deanry of Durham, though she stuck a good while, <HI>because of his youth and his marriage.</HI>— When he departed from court to Durham, Cecil, (now lord Burleigh) according to his grave and godly way, gave him much good counsel for his wise and good

It seems the great men then in power had an eye to selfish gains, from ecclesiastical preferments, for the lord treasurer sought to obtain a lease of Pit∣tington, from Dean Matthew, on which there were at that time two unexpired leases for long terms, which obliged the dean to draw an unfavourable picture of his possessions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

In February, 1621, Marc Antonio left England, and recanted, whereupon Mr Balcanquall was re∣stored to the mastership of the Savoy: In 1624, having obtained naturalization<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 150.</NOTE>, and taken the degree of doctor in divinity, he was installed dean of Rochester on the 12th of March. A short time after his becoming dean of Durham, those com∣motions arose in the state, which forced him from his mastership and deanry, when he was plundered, sequestered, and obliged to fly for personal safety. The Scotch troops vented their spleen on the cathedral church; and defaced all the monuments in the nave: The dean fled to the king at Oxford, and afterwards shifted from place to place, to escape the fury of the rebels: Being the mark of much inveteracy, as they attributed to him the writing of the king's declaration, in 1639.

<P>Walter Belcanqual, dean of Durham, complained of George Grey and Anthony Smith, two of the tenants of the Dean and Chapter of Durham, for misdemeanors committed by them, in getting diverse of the tenants of the said Dean and Chapter to set their hands and seals to diverse papers and petitions of complaint, against the said Dean and Chapter their landlord, and to contribute money for prosecution of their complaints; and as the said Dean did alleage, they did not make known to the Dean and Chapter their grievances, before they came up to complain.</P>
<P>The said Grey and Smith appearing before the lords of the council, did acknowledge, that what was alleaged against them was true as to the subscribing the petition; but declared they had cause to complain against the Dean and Chapter, for that contrary to a decree entred in the court of York and elsewhere, in the time of queen Elizabeth, which did ascertain their right in the renewing their leases, with savyor to them in respect of their tenant right; and that a small fine (in comparison of what the Dean and Chapter now required of them) had wont to be paid, of which, they said, they often complained as a grievance, but never obtained hopes of relief from them.</P>
<P>The council-board, after hearing the business, declared themselves dissatisfied with the tenants' proceed∣ings, and the archbishop of Canterbury moved, that the Dean and Chapter might do well to proceed against them in the Star Chamber, and never to renew their leases to the tenants, or the children of them who did complain; and that it were fit they should be committed to prison till they did produce the schedule of grievances subscribed by the tenants, to discover their names; and that they should pay so much money as they received from those tenants (who impowered them to prosecute this their complaint) to one of the clerks of the council, and that nothing should be deducted out of the same, to allow the said Grey and Smith any thing towards the defraying of their charges or monies laid out about the prosecution of this business; for, said the archbishop, he was confident it was a practice against the church, and did believe there was some fur∣ther design in the business.</P>
<P>Hereupon the council-board ordered, that Grey and Smith be committed to the gatehouse, and there to lie in prison, until they produce a schedule of the names of the subscribers, and that they did pay the money they had confessed to have received, (which was about the sum of eighty pounds) unto the hands of Sir William Beecher, one of the clerks of the council; which they paid accordingly, but continued in prison many weeks, because they would not deliver up the list of the tenants names that subscribed the petition; but a parliament meeting April 13 next following, they were set at liberty by the council-board, without delivering up the list of the tenants' names, and the paper of subscription containing their grievances.</P>

In 1626, he suc∣ceeded Dr Barnard Potter, his uncle, in the provostship of his college, and the next year proceeded in divinity.

<PB N="158" REF="170"/>
and in 1640, executed the office of vice-chancellor of Oxford, not without much trouble from the puritanical party: In the rebellion, he suffered much in the royal cause: Was a person greatly esteemed by all who knew him, for learning and piety: Was exemplary in his manners and discourse; of a courteous carriage, a sweet and obliging temper, and a comely presence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Ath.

<P>This period of time must not be passed over without observing, that archbishop Laud was very urgent for the establishment of decent regulations in the church service, and particularly for placing the communion table at the east end of the church, and enclosing it with a rail, to secure it from profanation and common business: But in 1641, the commons interposing their authority in those matters, the table was ordered to be removed, the rails taken away, the chancel levelled, ornaments to be disused, as basons, tapers, candlesticks, &amp;c. and that bowing at the hallowed name, towards the east, should be forborn. In short, the hour was come, when religious veneration was extinguished, and slovenliness, disorder, and irreve∣rence, similar to the rudeness of a Jewish synagogue, were tolerated in the churches<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The charges brought against Cofins (which in the annals of that bishop, p. 1178, were referred to this period of the work) were, <Q>That he set up a marble altar with cherubims, in the cathedral of Durham; that this with the appurtenances, cost two thousand pounds; that this ornamental furniture, which he calls appurtenances, was a cope, the representation of the Trinity, and God the Father in the figure of an old man. There was likewise said to be a crucifix, with a red beard and blue cap. The dean was likewise accused for lighting two hundred wax candles about the altar on Candlemas-day: For forbidding the singing any psalms before or after sermons: For making an anthem to be sung of the three kings of Cologn, Gaspar, Balthazar, and Melchior; and for procuring a consecrated knife, only to cut the bread at the com∣munion."—The answer Cofins gave in upon both, was to this effect, "That the communion table in the church of Durham, was not set up by Cofins, but by the Dean and Chapter, many years before he was prebendary of that church; and that Smart, the accuser, was one of that chapter; that by the public accounts standing upon the register, the charge did not amount to above a tenth part of what was pre∣tended. That the copes used in that church, were furnished long before Cofins' time; and that Smart was prebendary when they were bought, and allowed his share of the charge. That Cofins never approved the picture of the Trinity, or the image of God the Father in any figure; and that to his knowledge, there was no such representation in the church of Durham. That the crucifix, with a blue cap and a golden beard, was nothing but the top of bishop Hatfield's tomb, which had stood in the church above two hundred and fifty years; and that there was no such figure upon any of the copes, as is reported in Fuller's History.

<HEAD>The answer of the dean and prebendaries of Durham, setting forth the reasons why they could not possibly produce their booke of charter actes, as ordered by the Right Honourable the Lords of the Upper House of Parliament. Sans date, but probably about
<DATE>17 April, 1646.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>First, they supposing, that the said booke might bee in one of the trunkes which were sent to Hull, at the time of the distraction upon the entringe of the Scottish armie, did send an expresse messenger to Hull, with a letter to Sir Thomas Glemham, govenor of the towne intreating him to open the said trunkes before good witnesses, and to search for the said chapter booke; as appeareth by their letter unto the said govenor.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the said govenor did find but one trunck of the churches there, in which the book of their chapter actes was not to be found, as appeareth by the letter and testimony under the hands and seals of those who opened and searched the said truncke, by the govenor's appointment.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the dean and prebendaries immediately after, sent another express messenger to Durham, with let∣ters to their chapter clerke, requiring him at his perill to find out the said book, (whose charge properly it is) or else to come up himself in person, and give satisfaction to their lordships, why it could not be produced; as appeareth by their letters to the said chapter clarke.</P>
<P N="4">4. That their chapter clarke is not come up, but hath sent his servant, who hath deposed before their lord∣ships some things, wherein he may be deceived; because it is certain that he is mistaken in deposing, that Dr Duncon was present at the making up of that trunk at Dr Clarke's house, in which the said booke was sup∣posed to be.</P>
<P N="5">5. And therefore they do suppose, that that trunckeis lost, either by the negligence of the said chapter clarke, (hee being in the ship where it was, and it being his proper charge to looke after it) or by the avarice of marrinets, who finding it weightie, (as being full of books) might suppose it was filled either with money or plate; or, if it were left behind in the registry, (wher usually it remained) it might be torn and destroyed by the Scottish soldiers, who broke open both their treasurie and registrie, defacinge and destroying therein many evidences; and, in all probabilitie, would have done so with all the rest, if they had not been restrained and severely punished by their officers, especiallie by serieant major general Bailie.</P>
<P N="6">6. All thes things are ready to be deposed by the dean or prebendaries, which they well hope their lordships will easily believe for these two reasons:</P>
<P N="7">7. First, that the losse of the truncke is most prejudiciall and disadvantagious to them as having in it many of their leiger books, counterpanes of seale, and other evidences and chartularies, which must bee of invaluable losse to the church of Durham; and they are confident, that the booke of acts would have cleared them very much concerning their proceedings with Mr Smart.</P>
<P N="8">8. Secondly, to shew that they have used their utmost diligence, they shall produce unto your lordships all the warrants, which possiblie could be found in their registrie, for entering their actes into the said book. Which warrants contain the summe of all things that have been entered into that booke for almost twentie yeares; which is before the time that any difference hath been concerning Mr Smart.</P>

<P>was appointed dean of Durham; but it is doubtful was never installed: He was born at Hadleigh, in Suffolk, the son of Andrew Fuller; received his education in Cambridge, and was much noted for his learning, piety, and prudence: Was chaplain in ordinary to king James I. and king Charles I. and esteemed an excellent preacher; having preached several times before the king at Oxford. In 1636, he was made dean of Ely, and had the vicarial church of St Giles, near Cripplegate, London.— <Q>In the beginning of the rebellion, 1642, he was sequestered from his church pre∣ferment, imprisoned, and spoiled of all, for his loyalty to his prince, by the im∣petuous and restless Presbyterians <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ath. Oxon. vol. ii. p. 729.</NOTE>.</Q> After Oxford was surrendered, the dean retired to London, where he lived in obscurity and poverty, in an advanced age, and full of sorrows, till death released him from misery and fears, though not from persecution; at the age of seventy-nine, he departed this life, on Holy Thursday, the 12th of May, 1659; but the vengeance of those days of confusion followed him to the tomb, for his remains were denied interment in his own church of St Giles, so that his body was stolen to the grave, to the church of St Vedast, in Foster∣lane, where it rests in the south aile.

<HEAD>The certificate of the commissioners appointed to survey the manors, lands, and tenements of the late Dean and Chapter of Durham, by vertue of a commission, grounded upon an act of the com∣missioners of England, assembled in Parliament, for abolishing of Dean and Chapters; returned into the register office of the court of chancery, at Durham, <DATE>1st October, 1649.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We, the commissioners of survey, appointed and authorised for the survey of the several manors, lands, tenements, and hereditaments, of the late Dean and Chapter of the cathedral church of Christ and blessed Mary the Virgin of Durham, by vertue of a commission to us granted, grounded upon an act of the commis∣sioners of England, assembled in Parliament, for abolishing of deans, and deans and chapters, under the hands and seals of five or more of the trustees in the said act nominated and appointed; having deliberately perused several very ancient records, leger books, halmot court books, court rolls and accounts, belonging to the said Dean and Chapter, and yet remaining at Durham, and having also heard the deposition of many witnesses produced, touching the customary estates in reversion, claimed by the present tenants of the said late Dean and Chapter, thereby, and by all other lawful ways and means to inform ourselves of the truth of the said claim, do in all humbleness certify as follows.</P>
<P>Imprimis, We do find, that the several manors, townships, and villages of Belsis, Billingham, Wolviston, Newton Bewly, Bruntoft, Coopon Bewly, &amp;c. were part of the possessions of the prior and convent of Dur∣ham abovesaid, and very anciently belonging to the same.—And we do hereby find, that it manifestly appears from the year of our Lord 1500, that there were constantly (till the dissolution of the said prior and convent, which was about the 28th year of king Henry the 8th) several Halmott courts holden for the said prior at seve∣ral times in the year, of and for the all or most of the said manors and premisses, at which courts, the several tenants of and within the said manors, townships, and villages, came and entered their purchases, took ad∣missions as heirs or widows respectively, as the case required, and the entries thereof, were and are made <HI>cepit de Domino,</HI> &amp;c. such and such lands, <HI>faciendo Domino et vicinisque incumbent. &amp;c. reddendo et faciendo in omnibus prout, &amp;c.</HI> Such an one the last tenant, <HI>reddidit et facit</HI> and the like, as in copyholds and customary estates is usual, and as by exceeding many antient and constant precedents and entries, doth and may appear.</P>
<P>That afterwards, after the said prior and convent was so dissolved, and their possessions, reversions, privi∣leges, and inheritances, vested and settled by act of parliament, in the said king Henry the 8th and his succes∣sors, and conferred over amongst other lands and possessions, to a Dean and Chapter by him newly erected, and their successors, by his letters patents, bearing date the 16th day of May, in the 33d year of the reign of king Henry the 8th.</P>
<P>That after that, all the tenants of the said prior and convent, with all the said manors, villages, and town∣ships, becoming tenants of the said new erected Dean and Chapter, did continue their holds and possessions in their said farmholds and land, and could not be prevailed withall by the said Dean and Chapter, to take leases for twenty-one years in writing, though but at the old rents, howbeit much laboured and endeavoured by them, as appeared by some few inconsiderable leases, made by them to strangers of their lands, in the nature of concurrent leases, and of the reversions thereof, which yet were constantly, and are to this day enjoyed by the then present tenants, or their assigns, or such as do derive their interest, or have descended from them; the said lessees being employed, as it seems, to terrify the said tenants from their old way of holding into new leases, who yet continued in that manner, paying and performing the antient yearly rents and services accus∣tomed, and very few leases were taken, till the 15th or 16th year of the late queen Elizabeth's reign, as by the receipt books and rentals plainly appears.</P>
<P>That then many and great differences ensuing betwixt the said Dean and Chapter and their tenants, con∣cerning their estates, customs, and services, and the manner of the holds, which the said Dean and Chapter endeavoured to have altered, the then honourable lords of her majesty's privy council, and the lords president and council of the north, who from her majesty was authorised to hear and determine all differences of that nature in the northern counties, called before them the said parties concerned; and upon full and deliberate hearing and consideration had of the several demands, objections, and answers, of all the said parties, and by and with the consent of the said Dean and Chapter; did for the further and quiet settlement of the said estates, customs, holds, and services, make, decree, declare, and sett down their order, which was entered, as well in the books of orders and decrees of the said president and council, and of the privy council, as in the court of chancery at Durham, bearing date the 17th of August, in the 19th year of the reign of the said late queen Eliza∣beth; thereby ordering amongst other things, <HI>that the said tenants should hold their lands and tenements from the said Dean and Chapter by lease for twenty-one years, and so from twenty-one years to twenty-one years for ever, paying only three years fine at the most for renewing a lease for twenty-one years as aforesaid;</HI> and in considera∣tion thereof, the said tenants to continue the performance of their ancient and accustomed service in the wars, with horse, man, and furniture, upon the borders and marches of England towards Scotland, for the space of fifteen days without wages, when the said Dean and Chapter or their successors should require.</P>
<P>That the then Dean and Chapter in approbation thereof, and consenting thereto, did confirm the same un∣der their Chapter seal, bearing date the 27th day of February, in the 20th year of the reign of the late queen, and in observation, and pursuance of the said order, in relation to the three years fine therein specified; the said Dean and Chapter did, by their chapter act or grant, bearing date the 12th day of April, Anno Domini, 1626, order and appoint, <HI>that the said tenants should have their leases renewed from time to time without difficulty or delay, paying a year's fine every 7th year, without any other exaction or demand, which by true account, is three years fine for a lease for twenty-one years,</HI> as by the aforesaid order is limited and appointed.</P>
<P>And it doth also appear unto us, by the oaths of several persons produced and sworn thereby, and by all other lawful means, to inform ourselves of the truth of the claim made by the said tenants of a customary estate in reversion, in their tenements and farmholds after the expiration of their present leases: That the said tenants have accordingly had their leases renewed from twenty-one years to twenty-one years, and their fines never exceeded above three years rent at improvement, from time to time for twenty-one years, paying three years rent at the improved value, clear profit, ultra old rent and service, as a fine for a lease for 21 years, and to pay and perform their ancient yearly rents and services accustomed: And the said tenants have always had their leases renewed from twenty-one years to twenty-one years, and their fines never exceeded above three years rent at the improvement as aforesaid.</P>
<P>And it also appeared by the evidence, upon oath of diverse witnesses sworn and examined, that the said tenants right or trust in any estate in reversion so claimed as aforesaid, of and in the premisses, was so consi∣derable in the general repute of the inhabitants of that county and the parts adjacent, as that the said lands and tenements was usualy alienated and sold within three years value at the most, of freehold and fee simple lands; and that the said tenants did usualy alienate and sell their said tenant right or customary estates for five years purchase at the least; and that the said Dean and Chapter themselves, even when all the term of years in several leases of the said tenants were expired, did offer five years purchase, and sometimes more, to such tenants for their tenant right, or customary estate so claimed as aforesaid, in case such tenants were not willing or able to pay the usual fine for renewing their said leases.</P>
<P>And it doth further manifestly appear unto us, that the livelyhood and subsistance of many hundred fami∣lies in the said county, do solely depend upon the said tenements and farmholds, and the benefit they expect by their said claim of a customary estate and tenant right as aforesaid; and that diverse of the said tenants and their ancestors have continued some hundreds of years in the possession of their tenements, as it appears by the court rolls of the said late Dean and Chapter aforesaid.</P>

Whilst he held the deanry, he caused the cathedral and all the prebendal houses to be repaired; erected the grammar-school from the ground, and made it a nursery of good literature.

The chapter not only gave their consent to all these matters, but did all in their power to promote them; yet they were so far from exacting in the fines on their leases, and were so beneficial to all the poor, that, in an age very little favourable to the clergy, they are mentioned with honour for their humanity, can∣dour, and piety. Nay, in many cases, they were so bountiful as to recede from their own right, in favour of their successors, that the revenues of the church might descend to them with some augmentation.—<HI>Tempora mutantur!</HI></P>

<HEAD>The ANSWER of the Deane and Chapter of Durham, to a petition exhibited against them to his majestie, by some of their tenants, and by his majestie referred to the lords and other commissioners authorized for examination of the late pretended sailes of crowne and church lands. IN obedience to your lordship's order of the
<DATE>4th of Aprill, 1662,</DATE> these respondents say;</HEAD>
<P>That the petition which is not onely against the present Deane and Chapter, but against all their pre∣decessors from the first foundation, hath not any thing in it, which is not either impertinent or false, as wee are ready to prove in every particular.</P>
<P N="1">I. Whereas they call themselves the auncient tenants of the Deane and Chapter of Durham, the first of them is not soe much as a tenant, but onely a purchaser of a farme belonging to the said Deane and Chapter, which he purchased of one that had formerly purchased the sayd farme from the trustees of the laite usurpers, but was never the tenant of that farme to the Deane and Chapter: And as for all the rest of the petitioners, who were formerly tenants to the Deane and Chapter, and do still possesse their lands, there is not one of them that wee knowe that hath any lease in being, or hath made any application to the respondents for the renewing of his lease, neither hath any one of them pay'd any rent to the church since the late pretended dissolution of deanes and chapters, and some of them being required to pay their rents, answere, that they have purchased their rents.</P>
<P N="2">II. Whereas they alledge, that their ancestors, and they under whom they hold, held their lands to them and their heires under certaine rents servyces, and customes by copy of court roll, alledgeing for proofe thereof our booke of entries; these respondents say, that they have searched their booke of entries, and have not found any one tenant that ever held any of their lands to him and his heires, but onely for a terme of yeares, sometymes six sometymes nine, but for the most parte but three, with condition to be obedient to the pryor and covent, and provisoe (that if they dyed before that terme were expired) the grant to be voyd.</P>
<P N="3">III. Whereas they alledge, that ymediately after the dissolution of the priory and covent, the Deane and Chapter endeavoureing generally to breake the said customes, prevayled with some, and constrayned others to take leases; wee answere that it is true, that ymediately after the dissolution of the priory and covent, the Deane and Chapter did lett almost all their lands by leases, some for sixty years, some for eighty and some for more, but generally for but one and twenty years, which way of holding, being much better for the tenants, then that which they had before, wee cannot understand, what need there was of any artifices or constrainte to bring the tenants to that way of holding their lands.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Whereas they alledge an order of the lord president and councell of the north in the tyme of queene Elizabeth, wee answere, first, that there is a provisoe in that order that nothing therein conteyned, should extend to such tenants as formerly held their lands by lease, but only to such as called themselves tenants by customes, and were reputed by the Deane and Chapter to be onely tenants by curtisy: Secondly the order of the lords concerning those tenants, was made in consideration of border service, which is long since ceased: Thirdly, that the order of the lords was so little in favoure of the tenants, that some of them refused to take leases, according to that order, and others chuse rather to take leases simply: Fourthly, that all the leases for diverse years since, are without any referrence to such order, and as if there never had beene any such order.</P>
<P N="5">V. Whereas it is alledged that the Deane and Chapter designeing to brake this way of holding, also devyded the whole deanery among them by lottery; we answere, First, that the Deane and Chapter for diverse years before the order of the lords, did divyde many leases among themselves by lottery, but never since that order, and therefore it could not be with designe to breake that order: Secondly, that if the Deane and Chapter de∣vyded the whole deanry by lottery, the petitioners cannot derive their succession beyond those lotteryes, and therefore have not reason to complaine of them, nor pretence for holding from their auncestors before there was any Deane and Chapter as they alledge in the begining of their petition.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Whereas they alledge that such tenants as were brought to accept of leases from such prebendaries as they sell unto by lott, paid but three yeares old rent for five or little more; it is false that they paid but three years rent or little more, for compareing the fines with the old rents, wee finde the fines oftentimes above tenn times soe much as the old rent, and sometymes above twelve time soe much, as for 2l 6s. 8d. rent, 30l. fine for a farme in Ayckliffe, in the name of Edward Thompson; and for 33s. 4d. rent, 20l. fine to Richard Hut∣chinson for a farme in Burdon; and for a tenement in Westow, 2l. 15s. 4d. rent, 38l. fine, which is neare four∣teene tymes the old rent, which considering the proportion that was then betweene the rent and the true value of the lands, and the great disproportion, which is now by reason of the great increase of money, may be thought as great fines, as those which have been demanded since.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Whereas they accuse these respondents of not regarding his majesties late gracious declaration and letters, and the just desyres of the petitioners, which are to renew their leases without fine: Wee answere, that wee conceive they have made this accusation generall, because they are not able to instance any one particular; and we desyre them to name any one tenant that hath made application to be, who hath not beene offered
<PB N="166" REF="178"/>more in consideration of his purchase, and demanded lesse for fine, then is usualy offered and demanded by any church in England in treateing with their tenants.</P>
<P>Wee therefore humbly desire your lordships, that the petitioners may be required to make proofe of their allegations, which wee know they cannot; and although wee conceive wee are not bound to disprove them, wee are ready to shew the falsehoode of them, and the truth of every thing wee have affirmed, that it may ap∣peare to your lordships, how impudently they have abused his majestie, with a complicacion of many false al∣legacions, troubled your lordshipps, and slandered theire landlords, by whose favours they have enjoyed theire livelyhoods at soe easye a rate, as ought to have beene acknowledged by them with much thankfulnes.</P>

<HEAD>DENIS GRANVILLE<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">So he writ his name, and sometimes Grenville. See his works, to which is prefixed a portrait.</NOTE>, D. D.</HEAD>
<P>a younger son of the loyal and valiant Sir Bevil Granville, and brother to John, the first earl of Bath of that family. After a suitable education, in September, 1657, he was admitted a fellow commoner of Exeter College, in Oxford. On the 28th of September, 1660, was created master of arts; and soon after, marrying Anne, youngest daughter of bishop Cosins, was collated by his lordship on the 16th of September, 1662, to the archdeaconry of Durham; and to the first prebend in the cathedral church, which he exchanged for the second, April 16, 1668. He had also, of his gift, the rectories of Easington and Elwick; and in the room of the latter, the living of Sedgefield. But he took a very regular and exemplary care of them, in the due discharge of all ministerial functions, as appears by the directions given to his curates, printed among his works, On the 20th of December, 1670, he was created doctor in divinity, being then chaplain in ordinary to his majesty, as he had been for several years before; and on the 14th of December, 1684, was in∣stalled dean of Durham. Thus possessed of such great preferments, he might have long enjoyed them with much profit and honour to himself and friends; and have continued to be an ornament to his function, and a general benefit to the world: But some absurd notions entertained of the unlimited extent of the prero∣gative, together with his strict adherence to the doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance, involved him in inextricable difficulties. For, possessed with the
<PB N="168" REF="180"/>
indispensableness of their obligation, upon the prince of Orange coming to rescue this nation from the dangerous attempts made upon our religion and liberties, the dean opposed the measures taken for our common safety to the utmost of his power; by preaching, delivering charges to the clergy, sending up an address to king James, and subscribing a sum of money for his service. And when all his endeavours proved ineffectual, he was so entangled with those absurd doctrines, that, rather than submit to king William, he chose to lose his great preferments, and go into a voluntary exile; and, quitting Durham the 11th December, 1688, he arrived the 19th of March following, at Honfleur, in France. In February, 1689, he took a hazardous journey to England, whereby he got a small supply of money, to subsist abroad. His brother, the earl of Bath, (who was warm in the interest of the prince of Orange) endeavoured for some time to secure his revenues; but as no con∣siderations whatever could induce him to swear allegiance to king William and queen Mary, he was at length deprived of all his preferments, February 1, 1690. He not only refused himself, but likewise did all in his power to deter, or rather to terrify others from taking the oaths, by representing the revolution as a rebellion and usurpation. Having no prospect, after the late king James's defeat in Ireland, of recovering his benefices, he repaired to the abdicated monarch's court, at St Germain; where, though he had reason to expect an uncommonly kind reception, yet, because he was a protestant, he was soon obliged to retire, not only from court, but also from the town. 'Tis said, that upon the death of Dr Lamplugh, he had the empty title of archbishop of York conferred upon him by king James. In 1695, he came incognito to England, where he found no encouragement to make any stay. Having for some years enjoyed but an indifferent state of health, he died at his lodgings in Paris, the 8th of April, 1703, aged 64, and was buried at the lower end of the church-yard of the Holy Innocents in that city. His nephew, lord Lans∣down, draws his character to great advantage in the following words:—<Q>Sanctity sate so easy, so unaffected, and so graceful upon him, that in him we beheld the very beauty of holiness. He was as chearful, as familiar, as condescending in his conversation, as he was strict, regular, and exemplary in his piety; as well∣bred and accomplished as a courtier, and as reverend and as venerable as an apostle. He was indeed apostolical in every thing, for he abandoned all to follow his lord and master.</Q> From this man's example, we may learn the great dan∣ger and mischief of propagating absurd and unreasonable doctrines. Since there will always be found some person or other, that will embrace and stiffly defend them, though never so much to their own, or others prejudice: All not being equally endowed with the same penetrating genius, or not having a yielding con∣science alike <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See Biog.

<P>ISAAC BASIRE, D. D. was installed the 12th of August, 1643. In the Biogra. Brittannia, we are told he was born in Jersey, from the authority of Wood <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i, vol. i. f. 285.</NOTE>, which the annotator contradicts, but without telling us the certain place of his nativity. Grey, in his MS. Notes, says, he was born at Rouen, in Normandy, but quotes no authority; the place of his education is equally uncertain. The first of his being noted to us is under the patronage of bishop Morton, who ordained him deacon and priest whilst bishop of Litchfield, and made him his chaplain: In September, 1636, he was collated to the church of Egglescliff; in July, 1640, he had the degree of doctor in divinity conferred upon him at Cambridge, by mandate, and was incor∣porated in the same at Oxford, in November following; about which time he was made chaplain in ordinary to king Charles I. On the 24th of August, 1644, was appointed to the archdeaconry of Northumberland; and, on the 7th of July, 1646, was inducted to the rectory of Stanhope, on the presentation of king Charles I. On the breaking out of the rebellion, he was sequestered, plundered, and obliged to ab∣scond, and after flying to the king at Oxford, and sharing in the distresses of his sove∣reign, he fled the kingdom, and went to propagate the doctrine of the church of Eng∣land among the Greeks and Arabians, travelling through Apulia, Naples, Sicily, Morea, &amp;c. into Syria and Palestine. During his travels he collated the several confes∣sions of faith of the different sorts of Christians, Greeks, Armenians, Jacobites, Maro∣nites, &amp;c. which he kept by him in their own languages: In his travels he endured many hardships, particularly in 1653, he passed from Aleppo to Constantinople by land, being 600 miles, without either servant, or Christian, or any man with him, that could speak the Frank language; yet, by the help of some Arabic acquired at Aleppo, he performed that journey in the company of twenty Turks, whose courtesy
<PB N="198" REF="210"/>
was purchased by his dispensing to them in the physical line, he having studied me∣dicine at Padua. On the Restoration, he was recalled to England, and put in pos∣session of his ecclesiastical benefices. He was the author of many religious tracts and discourses, as also the Life of Dr Cosin, bishop of Durham, published with his funeral sermon. He departed this life on the 12th of October, 1676, aet. 69, and was interred in the cathedral church-yard at Durham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Ath. Oxon. vol. i.—Biogr. Brit. vol. i.—Vide Ger.

<P>WILLIAM SANCROFT, D. D. was installed the 11th of March, 1661. He was born the 30th of January, 1616, at Fressingfield, in the county of Suffolk, the fami∣ly's place of residence for three hundred years. At the age of eighteen he was placed at Emanuel College, Cambridge, and matriculated in the year 1634: In 1637, was admitted to the degree of bachelor of arts; and master of arts in 1641; the year following, was elected a fellow of his college; and took the degree of bache∣lor in divinity in 1648, but, refusing to take the covenant, was ejected from his fel∣lowship in the year 1649; upon which he went abroad, and became intimately ac∣quainted with the most considerable English loyalists then in exile. In 1660, he was chosen one of the university preachers, though it appears he was at Rome when king Charles II. returned to England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>A MS. of Mr Henry Wharton.—In a MS. vol. of collections now in St John's College library, Oxford, by Dr Rawlinson, the following is observable:—<Q>Wm Sancroft, at Padua, entered a student as appears by a testimonial, signed by the pro-rector and Syndik, 10th March, 1660.</Q> Pres. to Coll. Curio. Oxf 1781.</P></NOTE>. Soon after the Restoration, Dr Sancroft came home, and bishop Cosin, who knew him abroad, appointed him one of his chaplains; and on the 7th of December, 1661, he was collated to the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring, in which year he assisted in renewing the liturgy. By mandamus, he was created doctor in divinity in the month of March, 1661-2; and on the 14th of August following, was elected master of Emanuel College, which he governed with great propriety. In the beginning of the year 1663-4, the doctor was promoted to the deanry of York, which he held but a short time, yet long enough to expend 200l. more than the revenue produced, in repairs and other incident charges; during that short period bringing the church accounts into excellent order. On the death of Dr John Barwick, in 1664, he was removed to the deanry of St Paul's, soon after which he resigned Houghton, and the mastership of Emanuel. He now gave much attention to the repairs of his church, till the fire, in 1666, occasioned all his thoughts to be employed in rebuilding that fabric, to which he contributed 1400l. besides un∣wearied endeavours to promote a subscription: He rebuilt the deanry house, and improved the revenue thereof, as well as other livings in his gift, as dean. In 1668, he was admitted archdeacon of Canterbury, on the king's presentation, which he resigned in 1670. In 1677, being then prolocutor of the convocation, he was ad∣vanced by king Charles II. to the archbishopric of Canterbury, in which most con∣spicuous character, surrounded with the perils and errors of the times, he conducted himself with singular prudence, perspicuity, and religious virtue: His revenues were not dissipated in luxury and ostentation, but disposed in works of charity, muni∣ficence,
<PB N="205" REF="217"/>
and hospitality. He resigned this stall in 1674, having rebuilt the preben∣dal house. He attended king Charles II. on his death bed, when it is said, he made some remonstrances, and pressed sundry exhortations on the sovereign, towards which the complexion of the court had warmed his spirit. In 1686, the doctor re∣fused to act in the commission issued by king James II. for ecclesiastical affairs; and in 1688, was committed to the Tower, with six other bishops, for presenting a peti∣tion to the king, against reading his majesty's declaration of indulgence. The court pronouncing this petition libellous, on the 29th of June the prelates were tried for a misdemeanour, but, to the general satisfaction of the nation, were acquitted. He engaged his good offices for the dissenting Protestants, foreseeing the revolution that was approaching. On the 3d of October, accompanied with eight bishops, he at∣tended the king, who had demanded their counsel, and then, with a freedom virtue only inspires, urged the most serious and important advice to his sovereign, touch∣ing the unhappy situation of the state. A few days after, though very earnestly pressed by his majesty, he refused to sign a declaration of abhorrence of the Prince of Orange's designs; and on the 17th of November, he joined in another petition, for a free parliament. On the king's abdication, he signed, and concurred with the lords spiritual and temporal, assembled at Guildhall, in a declaration to the Prince of Orange for a free parliament, security of our laws, liberties, and properties, and of the church of England in particular, with a due indulgence to Protestant dissenters: But when that prince and his consort were declared king and queen, he refused to take the oaths to their majesties, was suspended the 1st of August, 1689, and deprived the 1st of February following. The above fact counteracts all the principles he ap∣peared to have adopted, and leaves his character under suspicion, or marked with duplicity, insincerity, and want of truth. The editor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Gutch.</NOTE> of the Collectanea Curiosa, embarrassed at this point, says, <Q>As for the archbishop's character, let it be learned from his actions; for if we go for it to the writers of opposite parties, it will ap∣pear, in different hands, as different as possible. He certainly gave the strongest instance possible of sincerity, in sacrificing the highest dignities, and other the greatest advantages, to what he thought truth and honesty.</Q> He continued at Lambeth till June, 1691, and then retired to his native place, where he spent the remainder of his life in strict retirement, and died on the 24th of November, 1693, aer. 77. The before mentioned editor says, <Q>His grace left behind him a vast multitude of papers and collections in MS. and therein more perhaps wrote with his own hand, than any man either of this or the last age ever did write<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr Wharton's Preface to archbishop Laud's Hist. of his Troubles and Trial, p. penuit.</NOTE>.

<P>EDMUND LAW, D. D. was installed the 8th of August, 1767: Was of St John's College, Cambridge, but invited to Christ's, and chosen a fellow of that society: Was one of the Zodiack, as a set of learned and ingenious young men in the univer∣sity were then called, and distinguished himself very early by writing on the Being and Attributes of God; and especially in his notes on his translation of archbishop King's <HI>Origin of Evil;</HI> wherein our ideas of space, time, and immensity, and the self-existence, necessary existence, and unity of God, are more accurately enquired into, and discussed with greater clearness and precision, than by any writer before or since, on such abstruse metaphysical subjects. He was also principally concerned in pub∣lishing an excellent edition of <HI>Stephens's Thesaurus.</HI> In 1739, he accepted the rectory of Graystoke, to which he was presented by the university. When Mr Howard, now duke of Norfolk, sold the advowson, he stipulated with the purchaser in favour of Mr Law, for a presentation from a Protestant patron. Mr Law accordingly re∣signed this rectory, and had a new presentation from Dr Askew, the purchaser. This allowed him to remove to Salkeld, the corps of the archdeaconry of Carlisle, a much more healthy situation, given him by bishop Fleming. While in Cumber∣land, he published <HI>Considerations on the Theory of Religion,</HI> which has gone through several editions; <HI>Litigiousness repugnant to the Laws of Christianity,</HI> an assize sermon, at Carlisle, and a charge on the <HI>Nature and Necessity of Catechising.</HI> In 1747, he proceeded to doctor in divinity: The divinity school was unusually crowded, and the rigidly orthodox were so alarmed at his question, that it gave occasion to much al∣tercation afterwards, in a variety of publications; but he himself, unwilling to give further offence, <Q>thought it a part of Christian prudence not to be more explicit on the subject, till men appear more willing to submit their vain philosophy to the authority of God's word, and are disposed to examine things with greater atten∣tion
<PB N="217" REF="229"/>
and impartiality; concluding in the words of honest bishop Taylor, that he had been so pushed at by herds and flocks of people, that follow any body that whistles to them, or drives them to pasture, that he was grown afraid of any truth that seemed chargeable with singularity.</Q> In 1755, he returned to Cambridge, having been chosen master of St Peter's College, when he resigned the archdeaconry, but kept the rectory. He served the office of vice-chancellor, in 1756, and, having a numerous family, he afterwards accepted the office of principal librarian, and that of casuistical professor; and had also the archdeaconry of Stafford, and a stall in the church of Lincoln, given him on his promotion to the See of Carlisle, in 1769; he kept the headship of his college, and had the rectory of Greystoke <HI>in commendam.</HI>— He published only two or three sermons afterwards; but, though advanced to a great age, such was his veneration for the great Mr Locke, and his love for freedom of en∣quiry, that he surprised the world with an excellent edition of the works of that great philosopher in four volumes, folio.—He is still living.</P>
<P>JOHN ROSS, D. D. was installed the 17th of March, 1769. He was born at Ross, in the county of Hereford, and was fellow of St John's College, Cambridge; was preacher at the Rolls chapel, and private tutor to Thomas viscount Weymouth, who presented him to the vicarage of Frome Zalwood, in Somersetshire: He was chaplain to the king, by whom he was presented to this prebend, on the 28th of February, preceding his installation.

<P>AFTER a tedious arrangement of the several ecclesiastics who sat in this church, the reader's attention is required to a description of the sacred edifices, with a comparative view of their ancient state and ornaments.</P>
<P>The traveller is conducted to this cathedral by the Place or Place-Green, where the whole north front lies open to the view. The situation is singularly grand and noble, the building stretching along the crown of an eminence, about eighty feet perpendicular from the surface of the river, which washes its base; on the east side
<PB N="226" REF="238"/>
the Bailey intervenes between the church and the brink of the hill; and on the west this venerable pile rises on the points of rocks, which shew themselves on the sum∣mit of the mount, and almost overhangs the stream: On this elevated ground the whole edifice has the most striking and august appearance. The towers to the west were anciently crowned with spires, covered with lead; the windows of the nave are under circular arches, of the original model; in the other parts (excepting the upper tier of the choir) most of them are of a different form and age. This front is now under repair, the stones being all chisseled over, and the decayed parts restored; the towers will receive new decorations, very different from the ancient ones, and the niches be supplied with new sculptures; the expence is estimated at thirty thousand pounds, to be paid out of the Chapter's treasury:—A distinguished act of public munificence!</P>
<P>As the proposed changes will effectually remove from the traveller's eye the ancient appearance of this edifice, it was thought expedient to present the public with a re∣presentation of the church in the state it was before the repairs began; and not∣withstanding the elegance of the present design, it is apprehended some of the ornaments might have been chosen with greater propriety: Above the great win∣dow of the middle transept, in two roundels, were the figures of Benedictine monks, cut in relief; by the mode of the sculpture, expressive of the age of the building. They led the judicious eye immediately to the aera, and gave an example of the state of that art: These roundels are now supplied with two fine new figures—the one a prior, seated in his installation chair; the other, an effigy of bishop Pudsey, cut from the figure on his episcopal seal, as given in the plate of his charter to the city of Durham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 13.</NOTE>. A century after this the figures will betray the spectator into an error, and lead him to determine, that this part of the structure was erected, or at least rebuilt, by that prelate. On the west corner tower of the east transept, were the effigies of those personages who attended the propitious cow, by which the monks discovered this seat of ease and magnificence; the cut shews the recess and sculp∣tures in their decayed state, the figures being now restored and finished with much

art. The great tower of the church, as remarked in the preceding part of this work, is much more modern than the rest, being built as high as the gallery, by prior Melsanby, who acceded in the year 1233, and his successor, prior Middleton: Prior Hugh, of Darlington, who was elected in 1258, finished the work, by build∣ing the belfrey or upper tower. The tabernacle work, pointed arches, and ornament on the outsides of the building, confirm those dates; for then the Gothic stile was in general acceptation: The buttresses of the tower are graced with niches canopied and finished with tabernacle work, in which are statues representing the great patrons of the See, in tolerable sculpture. The height of this tower, Willis says, is two hundred and twenty-three feet, describing the lanthern to be one hundred and sixty-two feet, and the belfrey sixty-one feet; but Mr Nicholson's admeasurement, which is most to be depended upon, makes the whole height two hundred and fourteen feet, that is, the dome or lanthern one hundred and sixty, and the bel∣frey fifty-four feet.</P>
<P>It appears that the Place-Green, before prior Algar's time, in 1109, was crowd∣ed with houses, and to him we owe that great elegance of an open area between the cathedral and castle, giving the two edifices at once to the spectator's view; he hav∣ing caused the buildings to be removed, and the ground to be reduced to a plain. The entrance to the church was by a portico, of much more modern work than the rest of the building, formed by pilasters and circular arches, the upper structure supported by flanking buttresses, from whence sprung a pointed arch, the whole terminating at a point in the center: The arms of queen Elizabeth, in stucco work, were placed on the division of two circular arches, where formerly were the win∣dows of a small chapel: The portico, during the late repairs, was rebuilt and highly ornamented: There were anciently two chambers above the north door, where persons were lodged to hear the call of such as came to claim sanctuary, and who rang the bell to give notice thereof; after which the fugitive was secure from se∣cular authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In ancient time, before the house was supprest, the abbey church, the church-yard, and all the circuit thereof, was a sanctuary for all manner of men that committed any great offence, as killing of a man in his own defence, or any prisoners who had broken out of prison, and fled to the church door, knocking to have it opened: Also certain men lay in two chambers over the north door for that purpose, that when any such of∣fenders came and knocked, they instantly let them in at any hour of the night; and run quickly to the galilee bell, and tolled it, that whosoever heard it might know that some had taken sanctuary When the prior had notice thereof, he sent orders to keep themselves within the sanctuary; that is, within the church and church∣yard, and that every one should have a gown of black cloth, with a yellow cross, called St Cuthbert's cross, at the left shoulder, that every one might see the privilege granted to St Cuthbert's shrine, for offenders to fly unto for succour, and safeguard of their lives, till they could obtain their prince's pardon: And that they should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> within the church or sanctuary, on a grate, made only for that purpose, adjoining to the galilee south door. They had likewise meat, drink, bedding, and other necessaries, at the cost of the house, for thirty-seven days, being only such as were necessary for such offenders, until the prior and convent could get them conveyed out of the diocese. This privilege was confirmed not only by king Guthrid, but by king Alured like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.—Cont. from Davies.—Sir John Lawson's MSS. and Mr Hogg's Roll.</P></NOTE>.

<P>It is unnecessary to present to the reader a dissertation on the ancient modes of architecture, to elucidate a description of the work, in the various parts of this edifice; the age of it is known, and the alterations made therein are almost criti∣cally ascertained: What we commonly call the Saxon architecture in such edifices, is in fact Roman; for those who constructed the religious buildings which arose in the earliest aera of the Norman accession, formed them after the models of workmen procured from the continent, (spoken of by Richard, prior of Hexham, l. i. cha. 3.) and came over to construct our capital buildings, expressly "according to the Roman manner." This stile prevailed till about the conclusion of king Henry the First's reign, when, what we now call Gothic was instroduced into Britain, so that in this church we find some strokes of the improved stile; for as the building was begun in 1093, so it was many years before it was completed: The walls were lest unroosed by bishop Flambard at his death; and the reader will recollect that bishop William brought the design with him from Normandy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol. i. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>. The ingenious traveller Mr Pennant, says, "In the inside is preserved much of the clumsy, yet venerable magnificence of the early Norman stile." The gateway, which is ten feet wide, is ornamented within on each hand with pilasters; the inner one, or that nearest the gate, very richly embossed with foliage, and figures in a light and ele∣gant stile; the other plain: The inclining arches are semi-circular; the inner mem∣bers carved in the zig-zag figure; the outward one embatteled or dentelled. The venerable pile strikes the visitor on his entrance with an awful solemnity not to be expressed; the stately and massive columns, the long extended ailes, the gloom which shadows the succession of arches, all contribute to affect the mind with an at∣tention best known by being experienced: Ideas arise replete with the distant an∣tiquity of the place, the piety of those from whom the structure had its origin, and the devotion which warmed the breasts of the religious whose characteristic virtues shone forth in the holy places. The plan or design of this building is more regu∣lar than generally to be found in structures of the like age: The length of the whole church within, exclusive of the gallilee, is four hundred and eleven feet; that of the nave, from the west window to the center of the columns which support the tower, is two hundred feet, and its width seventy-four feet, of which the center aile, from base to base of the pillars, is twenty-eight feet. The superstructure is support∣ed on two rows of columns. Mr Pennant says, the pillars are vast cylinders twenty-three feet in circumference: The two extreme columns to the west rise from bases of the form of a complicated cross, having pointed projections from the interior angles; the dimensions of each base are fifteen feet every way, being exactly similar
<PB N="229" REF="241"/>
to those which support the columns of the tower and dome, vulgarly called the lanthern; the pillars are clustered, having three semi-circular pilasters in each front, divided by an angular projection: The next column eastward rises from a base of the form of a cross, twelve feet each way, supporting a clustered pillar, the pilasters of which, towards the center aile, run up to the roof through the facia, between the upper windows; the next rises from a square base of eight feet, and is richly fluted, terminating with a plain capital, which supports the gallery above the side aile: Each intermediate pillar is clustered like those described in the second place, stretch∣ing up to the roof, and those in the intervals are circular, making the succession consist of a clustered pillar, and a round one alternately; the first round pillar is fluted as before described, the second covered with the zig-zag figure, and the third grooved with the figure of a net. The pillars opposite to each other are exact∣ly similar in ornaments and dimensions: It is also to be observed, the clustered and round pillars through all the building have their bases of the dimensions before set forth: All the side walls are decorated with pilasters opposite to the columns, and the interior spaces under the windows are filled with double pilasters and intersect∣ing round arches throughout the whole building, except only in the east transept. The arches between the great columns are all semi-circular, the outward members dentelled, the interiors zig-zag'd: The under gallery opens to the middle aile, with one round arch divided within into two arches, supported on a center pillar. There is an upper gallery of single arches. At the west end of the nave is a short cross aile or transcept, in length ninety feet, and eighteen feet wide from the cen∣ters of the columns, over the ends of which rise the west towers; according to Willis, one hundred and fifty-eight feet in height, but by Nicholson's admeasure∣ment only one hundred and thirty-eight feet. At the end of each side aile is a gate∣way, which opens into the gallilee. The ancient ornaments of the north aile are pointed out to the reader in the notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At the entrance of the north aile was a trellice door from pillar to pillar, which opened and shut with two leaves, like a folding door. Above it was likewise trelliced almost to the height of the vault, and on the top of the said trellice were iron pikes, that none should climb over it: It was never opened but on holidays, and at processions; and the north rood on the other side of the same pillar, at the north end of Jesus' altar, was likewise never opened but to admit some procession.</P>
<P>There were two holy water stones belonging the church, of a fine blue marble; the best stood within and opposite to the north church door, fixed in the corner of the pillar adjoining to the Lady of Pittie's altar, on the left hand as you turn into the gallilee, having a beautiful screen of wainscot, finely painted with blue and little gilt stars: It was kept very clean and fresh water always provided against Sunday morning, hallow∣ed before divine service by one of the monks.</P>
<P>The other stood within the south door, and supplied with fresh water every Sunday morning. That at the south door, served the prior, the convent, and the whole house; the other being for the use of those who came that way to hear divine service.</P>
<P>There was between two pillars, on the left hand, in the north aile, as you go into the gallilee from the north door, our Lady of Pittie's altar, inclosed on each side with wainscot, with the picture of our lady sup∣porting our Saviour on her knee, as he was taken from the cross.</P>
<P>And on the right hand of the said north aile, at going into the gallilee, under the belfrey, called the galli∣lee steeple, was St Saviour's altar.</P>
<P>In the west end of the church, and of the north aile over the gallilee door, is a belfrey, called the gallilee steeple, wherein hung four great bells, which were never rung but at principal feasts, or when the bishop came to town.</P>
<P>Every Sunday a sermon was preached in the gallilee, from one to three in the afternoon; previous to which, at twelve, the great bell of the gallilee tolled three quarters of an hour, and rung the fourth quarter. There were certain officers of the said house, who were always charged, whenever the bells were to be tolled, to be in readiness to ring them: But after the house was suppressed the bells were never rung. In queen Elizabeth's reign dean Whittingham intended to have them taken down and broken; when Thomas Spark, the bishop's suffragan, having notice of the dean's purpose, sent directly into Yorkshire for a workman, and caused three of the bells to be taken down, and hung up in the new work, called the lanthern, where he made a set of chimes, which cost him thirty or forty pounds.</P>
<P>The lowest window towards the lanthern had three lights divided with stone work. The picture of Christ crucified was in the middle of the first light; and in the second was the picture of our blessed Lady; on the other side that of St John the Evangelist: On one side of Christ was a monk in a blue habit, kneeling and holding up his hands. And above were six turret windows in plain glass.</P>
<P>The second window had two long lights divided with stone work, and in white glass, with coloured glass about it.</P>
<P>In the third were two long lights, divided with stone work, having in the first light the picture of St Cathe∣rine, and underneath her St Oswald, and below, that of St Cuthbert. In the second light was pictured the blessed Virgin, with Christ in her arms, and underneath St Bede, and below him St Osmond, bishop, and the arms of St Cuthbert and St Oswald; and four turret windows without pictures, in coloured glass.</P>
<P>The fourth window was plain, and as the second, with coloured glass about it.</P>
<P>In the fifth window were two long lights, divided as aforesaid, in white glass without pictures, but having round about coloured glass; and five turret windows; first four, and one at the top.</P>
<P>The sixth window had two long lights, with a stone work partition: In the first light was the picture of St Oswald, and under him St Paul; and in the second light was that of St Peter, and underneath him St James, in fine coloured glass: And above four turret lights, with bishop Skirlaw's arms on the top.</P>
<P>Within the church were two marble holy water stones, bossed with hollow bosses, on the outsides thereof curiously wrought: That at the north door was twice as capacious as the other at the south, both of the same workmanship. These were taken away by dean Whittingham, and removed into his kitchen, and employed to prophane uses. They stood there during his life: his servants steeped their beef and salt fish in them, there being a conveyance in the bottoms to let out the water, as they had when in the church. After that dean's death the greater was removed to the lower end of the dean's buttery, where the water conduit is, and next unto the wine cellar, for the servants to wash their pots and cups in, before they served them at table. The base of the great holy water stone was laid without the north church door, and afterwards placed in the earth, in the shop of one Lamb a black-smith, upon Framwellgate bridge.—Con. from Davies, Sir John Lawson's MSS. and Mr Hogg's Roll.</P></NOTE>.

to this aile, but all the old painted glass is destroyed. The vaultings of the side ailes are semi-circular, and crossed with groined arches in plain rolls, intersecting each other in the center. The middle aile of the nave is sixty-nine and a half feet in height; the roof was vaulted with stone about the year 1242, by prior Melsonby; the ribs intersect each other in pointed arches, ornamented with zig-zag workin the fillets: There are seven upper windows to the north, and six to the south. At the east end of the nave, between the pillars which support the great tower, anciently stood Jesus's altar, with all its decorations, no traces of which remain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the body of the church, between two of the highest pillars supporting the west side of the lanthern, opposite to the choir door, was Jesus' altar, where mass was sung every Friday in the year; and on the back∣side was a high stone wall, at each end whereof was a door, and called the two rood doors, for the procession to go forth and return at: Each end of the altar was closed up with fine wainscot, like to a porch, adjoining to each rood door, finely varnished with red varnish. In the wainscot, at the south end of the altar, were four grand almeries, to preserve the chalices and silver crewets, with two or three suits of vestments, and other or∣naments belonging to the said altar, for holy and principal days: And at the north end of the altar, in the wainscot, was a door to come into the said porch. There was also standing on the altar, a most curious fine table, with two leaves to open and shut, comprehending the Passion of our Lord, richly set in fine lively co∣lours, all like burnished gold; which table was always locked up, but on principal days. Also the fore-part of the said porch, was a door with two broad leaves, to open from side to side, all of fine through-carved work: On the principal days, when any of the monks said mass at the said altar, the table was opened, and the door, which composed the fore-part of the said porch, that every man might come in and see the table.</P>
<P>There was also in the height of the wall, from pillar to pillar, the whole story and passion of our Lord, wrought in stone, and curiously gilt: And above was the whole story and pictures of the twelve apostles, very artifically set forth, and finely gilt, extending from one pillar to the other. And on the top above all, a border artificially wrought in stone, with fine colours, and gilt, with branches and flowers. And likewise above the top of all, upon the wall, stood the most famous rood that was in all the land, with the picture of Mary on one side of our Saviour, and that of St John on the other, with two archangels.</P>
<P>Also on the back of the said rood, before the choir door, there was a loft, and the clock stood in the south end thereof.</P>
<P>Every Friday, after evening prayer, an anthem was sung in the body of the church, before St John's altar, called Jesus' anthem, which was performed by the master and choir, who sung another anthem sitting on their knees before Jesus' altar, one of the gallilee bells tolling.—Davies, &amp;c.</P></NOTE>.

In the center of the four west pillars, is the font, an elegant marble bason, over which is a fine piece of tabernacle work in red oak, of an octagon form, richly ornamented, and of excellent workmanship, supported by four columns about eight feet in height, the whole being about thirty feet high, terminating in a pinnacle, and decorated with a dove extending her wings. To the east of the font, between pillar and pillar, is a cross of black marble laid in the pavement, beyond which women were strictly prohibited advancing towards St Cuthbert's shrine <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>There is, betwixt the pillar on the north side wherein the holy water stone stood, and the opposite pillar on the south side, a row of blue marble in the midst whereof is a cross of the same coloured marble, in token that all women who came to hear divine service, should not be suffered to come above the said cross: And if it happened that any woman came above it, she was instantly punished for certain days, because no woman presumed to come where the holy man St Cuthbert was, for the reverence they had to his sacred body.</P>
<P>Also if any woman happened to come within the abbey gates, or within the precincts of the house, she was punished as an example to deter others from doing the like.</P>
<P>The reasons why women ought not to come to St Cuthbert's seretory, nor enter the precincts of the monastry.</P>
<P>Divers books of the life and miracles of St Cuthbert have been written, which set forth, That St Cuthbert, for a long time, led a most recluse life, in the borders of the Picts; in which time it happened that the daugh∣ter of the king of that province was got with child by some young man in her father's house. The king per∣ceiving her pregnancy, diligently examined her who was the cause of that fact; whereupon she made this an∣swer: That solitary young man who dwelleth hard by, is he who hath overcome me, and by whose beauty I am thus deceived. Whereupon the king repaired to the hermit's place, with his deflowered daughter, attended by divers knights, where he instantly accosted the servant of God in this manner: What art thou he, who, under the colour of religion, prophanest the temple and sanctuary of God? Art thou he, who, under the cloak and profession of an hermit, exercisest thyself in all filthiness? Behold my daughter, whom thou by thy wile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hast corrupted, not fearing to destower her: Therefore now at last confess this thy fault, and plainly declare here, before this company in what sort thou hast seduced her. The king's daughter marking the fierce speeches of her father, very impudently stepped forth, and boldly affirmed, that it was he who had done that wicked fact: At which the young man, greatly amazed, perceiving that this calumny proceeded from the in∣stigation of the Devil, applied his whole heart unto Almighty God, saying: My Lord, my God, who only knowest, and art the discoverer of all secrets, make manifest also this work of iniquity, and by some token dis∣prove the same, which, though it cannot be done by human policy, make it known by some divine token. When the young man had spoken these words, suddenly, and in the same place where the stood, the earth making a hissing noise, presently opened, and swallowed her up in the presence of all the spectators. This place is called Corwen, where she for her corruption was conveyed down into Hell. As soon as the king per∣ceived this miracle, he began to be greatly tormented in his mind, fearing le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for his furious threats he should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m the same punishment. Whereupon he, with his company, humbly craving pardon of Almighty God, with a further petition to that good man St Cuthbert, that by his prayers he would crave of God to have his daughter again: Which petition the holy father granted, upon condition, that from thence no woman should come near him. Whence it came to pass that the king did not suffer any woman to enter into any church dedicated to that saint. Davies, &amp;c.</P>

from the cloister door, was the tomb of bishop Nevil; between the second and third pillar stands an altar tomb of John lord Nevil, and between the next adjoining pil∣lars, the tomb of Ralph lord Nevil. Ralph lord Nevil died in the year 1347, and, as I observed before, was the first layman suffered to be buried within the walls of this church. His remains were brought in a chariot drawn by seven horses, as far as the gates of the church-yard, and then borne on the shoulders of his knights into the church: The abbot of St Mary's, of York, performed the funeral offices, and he was interred before the altar of the holy cross, where he obtained a mass to be daily said: His wife Alicia was afterwards buried near him. It was then a custom to make offerings at the interment of great men, and eight horses, four for war, with four men armed and caparisoned, and four for peace, were on this occasion the holy gift; together with three vestments of cloth of gold, interwoven with flowers. His son, John Nevil, redeemed four horses by the payment of one hun∣dred mares: But Mr Pennant observes, <Q>This favour was not done gratis by the holy men of the place: Ralph had presented them with a vestment of red velvet, richly embroidered with gold, silk, great pearls, and images of saints, dedicated to St Cuthbert <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>She also gave to the church one vestment, two tunicles, one cape, three albes, two stoles, and three ma∣niples of black sattin, with the arms of the said lord Nevil, and of Hugh lord Audley, her father, embroidered on the borders thereof.</P>
<P>The other monument contains the bodies of John lord Nevil, who died at Newcastle, the 17th of October, 1389, and his first wife Maud, the daughter of Henry lord Percy, at whose funeral six cloths of gold were of∣fered to St Cuthbert; of which were made two vestments for the high altar, one chalice, and two tunicles.</P></NOTE>.

These monuments were ornamented with the recumbent effigies of the great personages there interred, and surrounded with small figures of ecclesiastics in ala∣baster, finely wrought, but now mutilated and almost totally defaced: When the general disregard for religious edifices took place of old veneration, this church was thought the properest place of confinement and security for the Scotch prisoners after the battle of Dunbar; and they pillaged and destroyed every thing within their reach,—fulfilling the scriptures literally, making this holy place, in truth, a den of thieves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Robert Nevil, bishop of Durham, lies buried in his ancestor's porch, near to the cloister door, which is to the south, and Jesus' altar to the north of the porch, containing three pillars; and so much of the angle having in it an altar, with a fine alabaster table above it, where mass was daily celebrated for their souls, and therein a pew, where the prior used to sit to hear Jesus' mass. The east end of the porch, where the altar stood, was closed up with a little stone wall higher than the altar, and wainscotted above the wall; and the west end with a little stone wall, and an iron grate on the top of it, and the north side towards the body of the church was invironed with iron.</P>
<P>Also on the back part behind Nevil's altar, to the midst of the pillar behind the church door, in compass from pillar to pillar, there was a chamber, where one that kept the church, and rung the bells at midnight lodged: And over the church door, the compass of four pillars, two on either side, when one entered within the church door, was all covered above head with wainscot, very finely painted, and varnished azure, and set out with stars of gold. And in the fore-part of the wainscot, from pillar to pillar, within the church, over the holy water stone, there was a brattishing on the fore part of the wainscot or roof, very curiously wrought, and gilt with gold▪ and in the midst of the brattishing was a star of great compass, like the sun, very curiously wrought with gold, and enamelled; so there could no dust or filth fall into the holy water stone.</P>
<P>In the west end of this south aile, between the two nethermost pillars opposite to our Lady of Pittie's altar, was an altar with a rood, representing Christ's Passion, being commonly called the bonny rood, inclosed on each side with wainscot, as was the altar of our Lady of Pittie.—Davies, &amp;c.</P></NOTE>.

The clock anciently stood behind Jesus's altar, in the middle of the nave, fronting the choir door, but is now placed at the south end of the transept, and was built in its present elegant form, in 1632, in dean Hunt's time. The body of this transept is separated from its ailes at each end by two round pillars, and one clustered one; one of the round pillars is grooved in a

And every principal day the image was opened, that every man might see pictured within, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, most curiously and finely gilt; and both the sides within very finely varnished with green varnish, and flowers of gold: And underneath the stone she stood on, was a beautiful cross upon an escutcheon, called the Nevils' cross, signifying that the Nevils had born the charges thereof.</P>

Seaton, sub-prior, pictured in his blue habit, kneeling and holding up his hands, with these words underneath him, "W. Seaton, sub-prior." And in the third light was a bishop with a cross on his shoulder, called St Ambrose.</P>
<P>The third is called St Benedict's altar, having the like window: In the first light was the picture of St Benedict in a blue habit, with a crosier staff in his hand; underneath him the picture of St Hierome, with a cardinal's hat on: And in the second light, Christ as he arose from the dead and a prior in a blue habit, kneeling and holding up his hands before the altar, with a mitre set upon it: In the third light was the picture of St Catherine, with the wheel in her hand; underneath her the picture of Mary Magdalen, with an alabaster box in her hand, as she anointed Christ: And above were three tower windows, with angels in fine coloured glass.</P>
<P>The orders of St Benedict were set forth in their pictures about the altar in wainscot, with a partition, the friars within, and the monks without.</P>

<P>In this aile were three altars, called Houghwell's, the lady of Bolton's, and St Fides's altar towards the south, each having a window behind it.</P>
<P>The first altar had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine glass window with three long lights: In the first was the picture of St Catherine: In the second our blessed Lady, with Christ in her arms; and under her a monk in a blue habit, kneeling and praying: In the third was St Margaret, and under her St Christopher, bearing Christ on his shoulders over the water, having a staff flourshing in his hand: And three turret windows, with the picture of St John the Baptist in prison, having a grate before him, and a book in one hand, with the Lamb of God upon it, pointing unto it with his other.</P>
<P>The second altar had a window with three like lights, having in the first St John the Evangelist; and un∣der him the picture of St Nicholas: In the second light our lady of Bolton, with a golden mace in her hand, and a crown of gold on her head; and a monk under her feet kneeling and praying: In the third light, St Stephen, with stones in his hands, wherewith he was martyred; and under him the picture of St John the Bap∣tist, with the lamb in his hand; with three towers in coloured glass, with angels pictured in them.</P>

<P>In the end of the said altar, southward, was a fine glass window with three long lights: In the middle or first light was the picture of Christ crucified, and underneath a monk in a blue habit, kneeling and holding up his hands, having written above his head, "Christe Jesu Thomae des Gaudium:" And in the second light, the picture of the virgin Mary on one side of Christ: And in the third light, St John the Evangelist, on the other side of Christ: And above all, three lights, the picture of God, with a globe in his hand, in the middle lights; and the pictures of two angels on each side of God, in either of the other two lights.</P>
<P>There was a window towards the cloisters, west of the clock, which had three lights: In the first was the picture of our Lady; under her, the picture of St Cuthbert, with St Oswald's head in his hand: In the second light, our Saviour Christ on the cross, with INRI over his head, and angels receiving blood and water from his feet, and the picture of the sun and moon wanting their light above his head; under the picture of Christ was our Lady, and under her a monk in a blue habit, kneeling and holding up his hands, having above his head, "Mater Dei miserere mei:" And in the third light, was the picture of St John the Baptist, and St Oswald under him, in his princely attire.—Davies, &amp;c.</P>

<P>There were three pair of organs belonging to the said choir, for maintenance of God's service, and the bet∣ter celebrating thereof. The grandest of the three stood over the choir door, only opened and played upon on principal feasts, the pipes being all of the finest wood and workmanship, partly gilt upon the inside, and the outside of the leaves and cover up to the top, with branches and flowers, finely gilt, with the name of Jesus gilt with gold. There were but two pair more of them in England of the same make; one pair in York, and another in St Paul's.</P>
<P>Also there was a lettern of wood, like unto a pulpit, standing and adjoining to the wood organs, over the choir door, where they used to sing the nine lessons in the old time on principal days, standing with their faces towards the high altar.</P>
<P>The second pair stood on the north side of the choir, being never played upon, but when the four doctors of the church were read, viz. Augustine, Ambrose, Gregory, and Jerome, being a pair of fair large organs, called the cryers.</P>

In the center of this tran∣sept is the great dome or lanthern, supported on four clustered pillars, from the floor to the center of the roof one hundred and sixty feet in height<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>The admeasurement is here taken from without, but as the pavement of this church was new laid, and the tombstones removed about the year 1660, and you descend into the church by three steps, the addition may make 161 feet, 6 inches.</P>
<P>In the lanthern, called the new work, hung three fine bells, rung always at twelve o'clock at night; the monks going to mattins at that hour; four men were appointed to ring these bells at midnight, and at such times of the day as the monks went to serve God; two of the said men belonged to the revestry, and kept the copes, the vestments, and five pair of silver censers, with the other ornaments pertaining to the high altar, and lay in the chamber over the west end of the revestry: The other two men lay in a chamber in the north aile, over against the sacrist's exchequer; they swept and kept the church clean, and filled the holy water stones every Sunday morning, and locked the church doors every night.</P>
<P>The steeple of this cathedral, a stately fabric, is remarkable as well for its height as strength and just archi∣tecture, having on the inside a gallery of stone work around it, above the turn of the arches of the pillars upon which it is founded; above which are eight long windows, two on each front of the steeple, divided in the middle by a cross bar of stone, and handsomely glazed with plain glass. Above the windows, on the outside, is another gallery, and above that a superstructure, having two windows on each front, wherein hang eight melodious bells. In the eight buttresses, on the sides of the lower windows, also in the stone work betwixt each window, are niches, containing the statues of the founders, protectors, and benefactors.—Davies, &amp;c.</P>

in the beginning of the thirteenth century, has many marks of a refined taste: Round the bottom of the dome is a hanging gallery supported on corbles, each intermediate one sculptured with a human figure; the breast work or battlement of the gallery is formed in open rose work: The superstructure is ornamented in pannels with pilasters, terminating in tabernacle work: There are two long windows in each front, separated by a round pilaster, whose capital is pierced in flowers and foliage; pilasters of the same order are placed in the angles, and from the eight pilasters spring the groins of the arched roof or vault of the dome, which are braced at in∣tervals, and finished with a circle in the center, in a light and beautiful taste.</P>
<P>The ascent from the transept is by two marble steps to the choir, entering which, the visitor is struck with the magnificence and solemnity of the scene. The choir is one hundred and twenty feet in length, and in width equal to the center aile of the nave, the chief pillars running parallel through the whole building.

<HEAD>The CHOIR.</HEAD>
<P>In the east end of the choir, joining upon St Cuthbert's feretory, stood the high altar, with many precious and costly ornaments appertaining to it, as well for every principal day, as for every of our Lady's days. Be∣twixt the said high altar and St Cuthbert's feretory, was all of French Pierre, curiously wrought both on the outside and the inside, with images of alabaster, and gilt; being called in the ancient history Lardose. The said French Pierre or Lardose, reaching in height almost to the middle vault, and containing the breadth of the choir in length. In the midst whereof, right over the high altar, were placed, in very fine alabaster, the picture of our Lady standing in the midst, and the picture of St Cuthbert on one side, and of St Oswald on the other, all richly gilt. And at either end of this altar was a wand of iron fastened in the wall, whereon hung curtains or hangings of white silk daily. The daily ornaments that were hung both before the altar and above, were of red velvet, with flowers of gold, in embroidered work, and many pictures besides very finely gilt: But the ornaments for the principal feast, the assumption of our Lady, were all of white damask, beset with pearls and precious stones.</P>
<P>Within the said choir, over the high altar, hung a rich and most sumptuous canopy, for the blessed sacra∣ment, which had two irons fastened in the French Pierre, finely gilt; which held the canopy over the midst of the said high altar, that it could not move or stir; whereon stood a pelican of silver, upon the height of the said canopy, very finely gilt, giving her blood to her young ones. And the pix was of pure gold, curiously wrought; and the white cloth that hung over the pix was of very fine lawn, embroidered and wrought with gold and red silk; and four great round knobs of gold curiously wrought, with tassels of gold and red silk hung at them, and the four corners of the white lawn cloth; and the crook that hung within the cloth, that the pix hung upon, was of gold; and the cord that drew it up and down was made of fine strong white silk. And when the monks went to high mass, they put on their vestments in the revestry, both the epistler and gospeller; And when the office of the mass began to be sung, the epistler came forth out of the revestry, the other two monks following him, at the south choir door, and there stood till the Gloria Patri or the office of the mass began to be sung; and then with great reverence and devotion, they went all up to the altar; and one of the vergers that kept the revestry went before them, with a large tip-staff in his hand. The gospeller carried a fair book, which had the epistles and gospels in it, and laid it on the altar; which book had on the outside of the covering, the picture of our Saviour, of silver, of goldsmith's work, parcel-gilt; which book did serve for the pix in the mass. The epistler, when he had sung the epistle, laid the book again upon the altar; and afterwards when the gospel was sung, the gospeller did lay it down upon the altar likewise, until the mass was done.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="252"/>Also there was pertaining to the high altar two chalices, one was of gold, the other of silver, double gilt, and the foot of it set full of precious stones; that of gold was for principal days, and the other was to serve every day: Likewise there was pertaining to the said high altar, two great basons of silver, one for principal days, double gilt; and the other for every day, not so large, being parcel-gilt, and engraven all over; and two great crewets of silver, containing a quart a-piece, parcel-gilt, and engraven all over; and two lesser crewets for every day, all of silver; one pair of silver censers for every day, and two pair of silver censers for every double feast, double gilt; and two pair of silver censers, parcel-gilt, and the chains also for every principal day; and with two ships of silver, parcel-gilt, for principal days; and other two of silver, ungilt, for every day, to carry frankincense in; and two silver candlesticks, double gilt, for two tapers, very finely wrought, of three quarters height, to be taken in sunder with wrests; and the other two silver candlesticks, for every day's service, parcel-gilt; with sumptuous furniture for every festival day, of changeable suits. Divers of the vestments were set round about with pearls, both stoles and stannels. There were also other very rich jewels and ornaments per∣taining to the said high altar.</P>
<P>There were also two crosses to be borne on principal days for procession; one for gold, and the staff it stood in was of silver, of goldsmith's work, very curiously wrought, and double gilt. The other cross was of silver, double gilt, and the staff was of wood, of the same workmanship, and double gilt. Also there was another cross of crystal that served for every day in the week. There was borne before the cross every principal day, a holy water font, of silver, very finely engraved, and parcel-gilt, which one of the novices carried.</P>
<P>In the north side of the choir there is an almery nigh to the high altar, fastened in the wall, to lay any thing in, pertaining to the high altar.</P>
<P>There is likewise another almery in the south side of the choir, nigh the high altar, inclosed in the wall, to set the chalices, basons, and the crewets in.</P>
<P>At the north end of the high altar there was a very fine lettern of brass, where they sung the epistle and the gospel, with a great pelican on the height of it, finely gilt, billing the blood out of her breast to feed her young ones, and her wings spread abroad, whereon lay the book, in which they sung the epistle and gospel; it was thought to be the finest lettern of brass in this country. It was all to be taken asunder with wrests, every joint from the other.</P>
<P>Also there was lower down in the choir another lettern of brass, not so curiously wrought, standing in the midst against the stalls, a very beautiful one, with an eagle on the height of it, and her wings-spread abroad, whereon the monks laid their books when they sung their legends, at mattins, or other times of service.</P>
<P>Before the high altar were three fine silver basons hanging in chains of silver, one on the south side of the choir, above the steps going up to the high altar; the second on the north side, opposite to the first; the third in the midst between them both, just before the high altar. These three silver basons had latten basons within them, having pricks for serges or great waxen candles to stand on; the latten basons being to receive the drops of the three candles, which burned day and night.</P>
<P>There was also another silver bason hanging in silver chains before the sacrament of the aforesaid high altar, but nearer to the said altars than the others, hanging almost over the priest's back, which was only lighted in time of mass, and that ended, extinguished.</P>
<P>Also there was a handsome monument belonging to the church, called the paschal, which used to be set up in the choir, and there to remain from the Thursday, called Maunday Thursday before Easter, till the Wed∣nesday after Ascension-day. It stood upon a four-square thick plank of wood, against the first grees or step, behind the three basons of silver that hung before the high altar: At every corner of the said plank was an iron ring, whereunto the feet of the paschal were adjoined, representing the pictures of the four flying dragons; as also the pictures of the four evangelists, above the top of the dragons, underneath the nethermost boss, all supporting the whole paschal; and the four quarters have been four chrystal stones, as appear by the holes: And on every side of the four dragons there is a curious antique work, as beasts, men upon horseback, with bucklers, bows, and shafts, and knots, with broad leaves spread upon the knots, very finely wrought, all being of the finest and most curious candlestick metal, or latten metal, having six candlesticks or flowers of can∣dlestick metal coming from it, three on either side, whereon stood a taper of wax: And on the height of the said candlestick was a large pretty flower, being the principal flower, which was the seventh candlestick. The paschal in latitude contained almost the breadth of the choir, in longitude it extended to the height of the lower vault, whereon stood a long piece of wood reaching within a man's length to the uppermost vault or roof of the church, upon which stood a great, long squared taper of wax, called the paschal; having a fine convenience through the said roof of the church to light the taper. The paschal was esteemed to be one of the rarest monuments in England.</P>

<HEAD>The PASSION.</HEAD>
<P>Within the church of Durham, upon Good Friday, there was a most solemn service; in which two of the eldest monks took a large beautiful crucifix, all of gold, laying it upon a velvet cushion, having St Cuthbert's
<PB N="241" REF="253"/>arms upon it, embroidered with gold, bringing it betwixt them upon the said cushion, to the lowest steps in the choir, and there betwixt them, held the said picture of our Saviour, sitting on either side of it. And there one of the said monks rose and went a pretty space from it, sitting down upon his knees, with his shoes put off, crept upon his knees unto the said cross, and kist it; and after him the other monk did so likewise; and they sat down on either side of the said cross▪ holding it betwixt them; after that the prior came out of his stall, and sat down upon his knees with his shoes off: And in like manner crept unto the said cross, and all the monks after him, one after another in the same order; in the mean time the whole choir singing a hymn. The service being ended, the said two monks carried the cross to the sepulchre with great reverence; (which was set up that morning on the north side of the choir, nigh unto the high altar, before the service time) and there laid it in the said sepulchre with great devotion, with another picture of our Saviour Christ, in whose breast they inclosed, with great reverence, the most holy and blessed sacrament of the altar; setting two tapers lighted before it, which burned till Easter day in the morning that it was taken forth.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The RESURRECTION.</HEAD>
<P>There was in the church of Durham very solemn service upon Easter day, between three and four o'clock in the morning, in honour of the resurrection, where two of the eldest monks of the choir came to the sepul∣chre set up on Good Friday, covered with red velvet, and embroidered with gold, and then censed it, each monk with a pair of silver censers, sitting on their knees before the sepulchre. Then they both rising came to the sepulchre, out of which, with great reverence, they took a beautiful image of our Saviour, representing the resurrection, with a cross in his hand, in the breast whereof was inclosed in crystal, the holy sacrament of the altar; through which crystal the blessed host was conspicuous to the beholders. Then after the elevation of the said picture, carried by the said two monks upon a velvet cushion embroidered, singing the anthem of <HI>Christus Resurgens,</HI> they brought it to the high altar, setting it on the midst thereof, the two monks kneeling before the altar, and censing it all the time that the rest of the choir were singing the aforesaid anthem of <HI>Christus Resurgens;</HI> which anthem being ended, the two monks took up the cushion and the picture from the altar, supporting it betwixt them, and proceeding in procession from the high altar to the south choir door, where there were four ancient gentlemen, belonging to the prior, appointed to attend their coming, holding up a very rich canopy of purple velvet, tassled round about with red silk, and a gold fringe, and at every cor∣ner of the canopy stood one of the ancient gentlemen to bear it over the said image, with the holy sacrament carried by the two monks round about the church, the whole choir waiting upon it with torches and a great number of other lights, all singing, rejoicing, and praying to God most devoutly, till they returned to the high altar, whereon they placed the said image, there to remain till Ascension day.</P>
<P>Ludovicus de Bello Monte, bishop of Durham, lies buried before the high altar in the choir, under a most curious and sumptuous marble stone, which he prepared for himself before he died; being adorned with most excellent workmanship of brass, whereon he was most excellently and lively pictured, as he was accustomed to sing or say mass, with his mitre on his head, and his crosier staff in his hand, with two angels finely pictur∣ed, one on the one side of his head, and the other on the other side, with censers in their hands censing him; and containing also pictures and image of the twelve apostles, divided and bordered on either side of him; and next them are bordered on each side of the twelve apostles, in another border, the pictures of his ancestors, in their coats of arms, being of the blood royal of France; he had a white lion placed upon the breast of his vestment, underneath the verses of his breast, with flower-de-luces about the lion; and two lions pictured, one under one foot of him, and the other under his other foot, supporting and holding up his crosier staff, his feet adjoining and standing upon the said lions; and two other lions beneath them, in the nethermost border of all, being very artificially wrought in brass.</P>

<P>The names of the monks who were officers within the abbey church, at the time of the dissolution.</P>
<P>Dr Richard Crosby, master of the novices.</P>
<P>There was always six novices, who went daily to school within the house, for the space of seven years toge∣ther, and one of the eldest and most learned monks was their tutor. The said novices had no wages, but meat, drink, and apparel, for that space. The master, or tutor's office was to see they wanted nothing; as cowls, frocks, stamyne, bedding, boots, socks; and as soon as they needed any of these necessaries, the master had charge to call at the chamberlain's for such things. They never received wages, nor handled money in that time, but went daily to their books in the cloyster: And if the master found any of them more apt to learn, and diligently prosecuting his studies, then he gave notice thereof to the prior, and he was soon sent to Oxford, there to learn and study divinity, and the rest of the novices were kept at their books, till they could understand their service and the scriptures. At seven years of age they sung their first mass, and from thence the house was no longer charged with finding them apparel; for then they entered into wages, to find them∣selves with apparel, which was twenty shillings a-year each, and had no more to supply themselves withal.— The eldest monk in the house had no more, except he had an office. His chamber was in the dorter.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="254"/>Dr John Porter, alias Smith, sacristan.</P>
<P>The sacrist's exchequer was within the church, in the north alley, opposite to bishop Skirlaw's altar, on the left hand as you go up to the abbey of St Cuthbert's feretory.</P>
<P>His office was to provide bread and wine for the church, and wax and lights in winter. He had always a tun of wine lying in his exchequer, for the use of the church. He had also sacristan-heugh in his keeping; it was his charge; and St Mary's cupboard was his office. He was also to see the glass windows repaired, and the plummer's work of the church done; and mending of bells and bell-ropes, and all other works necessary to be performed, both within and without the church, and to see the church kept clean.</P>
<P>His office was also to lock up every night the keys of every altar in the church, every altar having its seve∣ral almery, and some two, to lay the said keys forth every morning between seven and eight o'clock, upon the top of the almery, which was of wainscot, wherein they were locked, which stood within the north choir door, that every monk might take the key, and go to what altar he was disposed to say mass at.</P>
<P>They also went to the chapter-house every day between eight and nine o'clock, where all the bishops in the old time were buried, and there prayed for all their benefactors, and those who had bestowed any thing upon this church. At nine o'clock a bell was rung to mass, called the chapter mass, which was always sung at the high altar; and he that sung the mass had always in his memento, all those who had given any thing to this church. One half of the monks said mass in the chapter mass time, and the other half that sung not the chap∣ter mass, said mass in the high mass time.</P>
<P>There were at every altar two chalices, and two silver crewets appertaining to it, both with albs and vest∣ments for principal feasts; as also for all other days beside. Every altar had its double furniture for adorning all parts of the altar, serving both for holidays and principal feasts.</P>
<P>Their founders and benefactors were prayed for every day, and had in remembrance in the time of saying mass.</P>
<P>The sacristan's chamber was in the dorter, and he had his meat served from the great kitchen to his exchequer.</P>
<P>Other officers of the church.</P>
<P>Dr Robert Bennet, bowcer of the house: He was the first prebendary in the eleventh stall. Anno 1542.</P>
<P>His exchequer was a little stone house joining upon the coal-garth pertaining to the great kitchen, a little distant from the dean's hall stairs.</P>
<P>Dr Roger Wright, cellerer of the house.</P>
<P>His exchequer was afterwards Dr Tod's chamber, joining to the west end of the great kitchen, having a pair of stairs going up to it, and was the first prebendary in the eleventh stall. Anno 1542.</P>
<P>Dr Roger Watson, terrer of the house.</P>
<P>His exchequer was as you go into the guest-hall, on the left hand in the entry at going into the great hall.</P>
<P>Dr William Forster, keeper of the garners.</P>
<P>The master of the garners exchequer was over Mr Pilkington's hall door, all whose house, and Mr Bun∣ney's, were garners, where their wheat and other corn lay.</P>
<P>These granaries are at present the houses of the seventh and eighth prebendaries.</P>
<P>The kiln was where Mr Robert Bennet's lodging was, beyond the conduit. This lodging was built at his own expence. It is at this time the house of the eleventh prebendary.</P>
<P>Dr Thomas Spark, chamberlain, the first prebendary in the third stall. Anno 1542.</P>
<P>His exchequer was near the abbey-gates; now the mansion-house of the first prebendary.</P>
<P>The chamberlain's office was to provide stamyne, otherwise called linsey-woolsey, for sheets and shirts for the novices and the monks, for they were not permitted to wear linen. He kept a taylor daily at work, in making socks of white woollen cloth, both whole and half socks; and making shirts and sheets of linsey-woolsey, in a shop underneath the exchequer. This taylor was one of the servants of the house. The cham∣ber where he lay was in the dorter.</P>
<P>Dr Henry Brown, master of the common-house.</P>
<P>His office was to provide all such spices against Lent as should be comfortable to the monks, under their great austerity, both of fasting and praying; and to have a fire constantly in the common-house hall, for the monks to warm themselves at when they pleased; and to provide always a hogshead of wine for the monks; and for keeping his O, called O Sapientia, and to provide sigs and walnuts for Lent. His chamber was in the dorter.</P>
<P>Dr William Watson, the prior's chaplain.</P>
<P>His exchequer was over the stairs in going up to the dean's hall. He was the first prebendary in the twelfth stall. Anno 1542.</P>
<P>His office was to receive at the bowcer's hands, all such sums of money as were payable by him to the lord prior's use for his maintenance, the expence of his whole houshold, and his other necessaries. The said chap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia was to provide apparel for the lord prior, and to see all things in good order in the hall, and the furniture
<PB N="243" REF="255"/>for his table to be sweet and clean; and that every man executed his office diligently as he ought to do; and that no debate or strife should be within the house. He had in his custody all the lord prior's plate and trea∣sure, as well for delivering it out, as receiving it again. He was also to discharge and pay all the gentlemen, yeomen, and all other the servants and officers of the lord prior's house their wages, and to discharge all other debts of the house whatsoever. His chamber was adjoining to the prior's chamber.</P>
<P>All these monks were in these offices when the house was suppressed.</P>
<P>The ancient custom of procession in the abbey church of Durham, on certain festivals.</P>
<P>Upon St Mark's day.</P>
<P>St Mark's day was commonly kept a fast through all the country, and no flesh eaten upon it: The prior with the monks made a solemn procession, and went to Bow church, doing very solemn service there; and one of the monks made a sermon to the parishioners and town's men who came thither.</P>
<P>The procession on the three cross days, by the prior and monks.</P>
<P>On Monday in cross-week they had another solemn procession, going to St Oswald's church in Elvet, and there did a solemn service: A sermon was preached by one of the monks, before a numerous audience.— Tuesday, the day following, in another solemn procession, they went to St Margaret's church, in Crosgate, with solemn service, and a sermon. On Wednesday, the next day, they had the like procession to St Nicho∣las' church, there doing divine service very solemnly, and a sermon was preached before a great audience.</P>
<P>The procession on Holy-Thursday, Whit-Sunday, and Trinity-Sunday, by the prior and the monks.</P>
<P>The next morning, being Holy-Thursday, they had a general procession, with two crosses borne before them; one, both cross and staff, all of gold; the other of silver parcel-gilt, with that holy relique St Cuthbert's banner, being carried first in the procession, with all the rich copes belonging to the church, every monk one. The prior had an exceedingly rich one of cloth of gold, which was so massy that he could not go upright with it, unless his gentlemen, who at other times bore up his train, supported it on every side whenever he had it on. He had his crosier staff in his hand, which was of silver double guilt, and a rich mitre on his head: Also that holy relique St Bede's shrine, was carried in the procession by four monks, upon their shoulders. And other monks carried about with them in the said procession, several holy reliques, as the picture of St Oswald, of silver gilt, and St Margaret's cross, of silver double gilt. The procession came out at the north door of the abbey church and through the church-yard, and down Lidgate, by Bow church end, and up the South Bailey, and in at the abbey gates, where a great number of people stood, and so proceeded through the abbey garth, whither no woman was permitted to go; and so through the cloisters into the church.</P>
<P>Upon Whit-Sunday was a general procession, with the same solemnities as had been observed on Holy-Thursday, with St Bede's shrine, St Cuthbert's banner, and all the holy reliques; as the image of St Oswald, and the image of St Aidanus, and St Margaret's cross, and divers others.</P>
<P>On Trinity-Sunday was another general procession as aforesaid, with all the above recited reliques, going the same circuit.</P>

towards the east on the south side, for the vicar-general of the diocese; and others on both sides, for the reception of the judges of assize, sheriff, mayor, and corpora∣tion of the city, &amp;c. on such accustomed days as they attend divine service there; the whole finished in a magnificent stile with tabernacle work. Beneath the stalls are seats for the lay-singers, choristers, almshouse-men, and scholars of the founda∣tion. Advancing towards the altar, where the stalls terminate, the pavement is elevated one step, and on the right-hand is the bishop's throne, erected by bishop Hatfield, over the vault prepared for his own monument, and built in a stile con∣sistent with the proud idea he held of the dignity of his mitre. Mr Pennant speak∣ing of it, says, <Q>In the choir is the bishop's throne, elevated to an uncommon height, erected in times of the triumph of superstition. A painful ascent to the present prelate, whose wish is directed more to distinguish himself by benevolence and sincerity, than any exterior trappings or badges of dignity.</Q> The ascent to the throne is by many steps; in the center is a chair of state, richly ornamented, and canopied over head with tabernacle work, coloured and gilt; on each side, the throne is lined with tapestry, and otherwise handsomely furnished, large enough to receive the chief temporal officers, with the servants who are about the prelate's person: The bishop, when he goes to his throne, is always preceded by a person
<PB N="244" REF="256"/>
bearing a massy gilded mace, in distinction of his secular power. Chambrè tells us, <HI>Novum ad australem partem chori...juxta stallos monachorum curiosum opus construxit, in medio cujus stallum episcopale, imaginibus subtiliter sculptis, sumptibus copiosis in opera∣rios largissime impensis, honorifice circumseptum, fecit &amp; decenter ordinavit</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The throne was repaired by Lord Crewe; and in 1772, was new painted and gilt by bishop Egerton.</NOTE>. The images are all removed. Below the throne are stalls for the prebendaries' ladies: On the opposite side of the choir, where bishop Skirlaw's tomb was, are other stalls for the ladies of the bishops, and dean's families and others; and close adjoining is the pulpit, finely ornamented with inlaid figures in the Italian stile, representing some of the apostles, the ground Swedish oak; the figures are almost as large as life, so artfully shadowed as to appear like a delicate painting in bronze: The sounding board is supported by one column. The opening into the side ailes to which you descend by five marble steps, is by a gate, and two side lights of open tracery work, in wood, finely executed and finished above with tabernacle work. The choir com∣prehends four pillars on each side, two of them clustered, and two round, the round ones cut in the spiral figure: The double gallery above the side ailes is formed of circular arches, each of the lower openings divided by a single column. The roof was repaired, or rather new vaulted by prior Hotoun, who acceded in 1289; it is of elegant Gothic work, the ribs of the arches terminating in points ornamented with roses, the fillets pierced in roses and crosses: Some of the decorations of the center roses are singular; one next to the organ contains a human figure, with three round balls in an apron, not unusual among the heathen emblematical effigies. From the altar rails eastward, the whole work appears nearly of the same date, and by the ar∣chitecture of this part of the edifice, we are led to conclude that the building origi∣nally terminated here, and was opened further eastward to form a connection with the east transept: The columns which rise at the altar rail, are little more than the plain facing of a common wall, ornamented with long small round pilasters, single and belted in the middle, their capitals pierced, decorated with figures of animals, and finished above with tabernacle work; the whole appearing like ornaments placed occasionally there: The opening of the gallery in this part is different from the rest of the church, consisting of three pointed arches, supported by columns whose capitals are richly pierced, and the fillets of the arches are pierced and highly decorated; there is also an interior pillar supporting a groined vaulting. Here the building appears to have been broken off and the east wall removed. The vaulting of the roof is continued, and over the altar table finishes with a fine pointed arch, supported on clustered pillars, ranging with the side of the east tran∣sept; the capitals and the fillets or mouldings of the arch are highly finished with pierced work, and bear no degree of similitude to any of the more western parts of this edifice. Within the altar rails eastward, from the plain columns before des∣cribed, are four seats on each side of the altar table, for the officiating priests to rest, formed of pillars, supporting pinnacle work, of the same materials and design as the work behind the altar, and most probably erected at the same time: These seats are closed from the ailes behind with a wall, which proves the occasionality, by

<P>Mr Ebdon, an architect, brother to the present organist, published two excellent views of the choir of this church.</P>
<P>Into this sumptuous new church was the last and great translation of St Cuthbert, but before the day came, prior Turgot, with some of his brethren, determined to open his tombe with intent to shew his body to the people, if they found it entire: Att night, therefore, they mett at his sepulchre, and reverently taking off the stone, they found a chest well fortified with nayles and leather, and in it another wrapt in cloth thrice double, in which they found the booke of the evangelists which had fallen into the sea, a little silver altar, a goblet of pure gold, with an Onyx stone, and an ivory comb: Lastly, opening the third chest, they found the body of the saint (which the grave in so many years had not digested) lying upon the right side to give room to the rest of the reliques: For in the same coffyn were the bones of Venerable Beda, the head of St Oswald, part of the bones of Aidanus, Eadfrid, and Ethelwold, bishops of Lindisfarne: All which reliques they placed with due reverence in other parts of the church; and laying St Cuthbert on his back, they placed St Oswald's head be∣tween his bands. At the day of his translation, Ranulphus, the bishop, published in his sermon to the people, the incorruption of St Cuthbert's body, which, after four years was flexible, and now might plead prescrip∣tion with the grave to be immortale. And thus in great solemnity they inshrined him beneath the high altar in the presence of the abbot of St Albans, the abbot of St Maries, in Yorke, the abbot of St Germans, prior Turgot, with thousands of people spectators of the miracle. Hegge's Legend, p. 23.</P>
<P>In 1284, William, bishop of Dumblain, granted an indulgence whereby every one who visited this saint's shrine were to be excused forty days of their penance.

<P>The book of the evangelists here mentioned was originally written by Edfrid, then a monk and afterwards bishop of Lindisfarne, who, during his retirement in that monastery. translated the gospels into Latin.

<P>Next to the nine altars was the monument of St Cuthbert, having the high altar on the west, in the midst whereof his shrine was exalted with most curious workmanship, of fine green marble, gilt with gold; having four seats or places underneath the shrine, for pilgrims or lame men, sitting on their knees to rest on, in the time of their devout offerings. It was esteemed one of the most sumptuous monuments in all England, so great were the offerings and jewels bestowed upon it.</P>
<P>At the west end of this shrine was a little altar for mass to be said on, only upon the great and holy feast of St Cuthbert's day in Lent: At which solemnity the prior and the whole convent did keep open houshold in the frater-house, and dined all together, and on no day else in the year: And at this feast, and certain other festival days, they were accustomed to draw up the cover of St Cuthbert's shrine, being of wainscot, having six very fine sounding silver bells fastened to the rope; which, at the drawing up of the cover, made a goodly sound; which said cover on the outside was very finely and artificially gilded. And on either side were painted four lively images; on the east end the picture of our Saviour sitting on the rainbow to give judgment; on the west end was the picture of our Lady, and Christ on her knee; and on the height of the cover from end to end was a fine brattishing of carved work, cut throughout with dragons, fowls, and beasts; and the inside of the cover was all varnished and coloured with a fine sanguine colour; and at every corner of the cover there was a lock to lock it down.</P>
<P>Also within the said feretory, both on the north side and the south, there were almeries of wainscot, varnish∣ed, finely painted, and gilt over with little images, for the reliques of St Cuthbert to lie in; and within the almeries did lie all the holy reliques that were offered to St Cuthbert; and when his shrine was drawn, the almeries were opened, that every man might see the holy reliques therein, accounted the most sumptuous
<PB N="247" REF="259"/>and richest jewels in all this land; for great were the gifts and godly devotion of kings, queens, and other estates, at that time, towards God and holy St Cuthbert in this church.</P>
<P>Within this feretory were many little pictures of saints, of imagery work, all of alabaster, set in the French Pierre in their several places, the pictures being curiously engraved and gilt; and the Nevil's cross and bulls head set upon the height; and on either side of the two doors in the French Pierre, and also in divers other places of the French Pierre besides; which feretory and French Pierre were made at the charges of John lord Nevil.</P>
<P>At the east end of St Cuthbert's feretory were wrought upon the height of the irons towards the nine altars, very fine candlesticks of iron, like unto sockets, which had lights set in them before day, that every monk might have light to see to read their books at the said nine altars, when they said mass; and also to give light to all others that came thither to divine service.</P>
<P>The king of Scots' ancient and his banner, with divers other noblemen's ancients, were all brought to St Cuthbert's feretory; and there the said lord Nevil offered the jewels and banners; and there the said banners and ancients stood and hung till the suppression of the house. The lord Nevil's banner staff was all wrythen about with iron, from the midst upward, and stood on the north end of the feretory: And the king of Scots' banner hung over the midst of the alley of the nine altars, under St Catharine's window, in the east end of the church; and a little after the suppression of the house, they were all taken down, spoiled and defaced, that the memory thereof should be clean taken away, being both a great honour to the realm, and a decent ornament unto the church.</P>

<HEAD>St Cuthbert's shrine defaced.</HEAD>
<P>The shrine of St Cuthbert was defaced at the visitation held at Durham, for demolishing such monuments, by Dr Lee, Dr Henley, and Mr Blithman, in king Henry the Eighth's reign, at his suppression of religious houses. They found many goodly and valuable jewels, especially one precious stone, which was of value suf∣ficient to redeem a prince. After the spoil of ornaments and jewels, they approached near to his body, ex∣pecting nothing but dust and ashes; but perceiving the chest he lay in strongly bound with iron, the gold∣smith with a smith's great fore-hammer broke it open, when they found him lying whole, uncorrupt, with his face bare, and his beard as of a fortnight's growth, and all the vestments about him, as he was accustomed to say mass, and his metwand of gold lying by him. When the goldsmith perceived he had broken one of his legs, in breaking open the chest, he was sore troubled at it, and cried, Alas! I have broken one of his legs; which Dr Henley hearing, called to him, and bade him cast down his bones: The other answered he could not get them asunder, for the sinews and the skin held them so that they would not separate. Then Dr Lee stept up to see if it were so, and turning about, spake in Latin to Dr Henley, that he was intire, though Dr Henley not believing his words, called again to have his bones cast down: Dr Lee answered, if you will not believe me, come up yourself, and see him: Then Dr Henley stept up to him, and handled him, and found he lay whole: Then he commanded them to take him down; and so it happened contrary to their expectation, that not only his body was whole and uncorrupted, but the vestments wherein his body lay, and wherein he was accustomed to say mass, were fresh, safe, and not consumed. Whereupon the visitors commanded him to be carried into the revestry, till the king's pleasure concerning him was further known; and upon the receipt thereof, the prior and monks buried him in the ground under the place where his shrine was exalted. Davies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In 1255. <Q>Henry III. beinge in theise partes, visited St Cuthbert, (as they call it) and while he was at his devocions, a courtyer whyspered in his care, that dyvers byshops of his had hydden muche treasure in St Cuthberte's tombe. The kinge made shorte, and openinge the tombe, sound it to be even foe; whereupon he devised to borowe the same, least they should charge him with prophanation of the holye reliques: But Paris compleneth, that they weare never halfe payed againe.</Q> Lambard's Topographical and Historical Dictionary, page 86.</P>
<P>In this new church was erected a sumptuous shrine, called the feretory, about three yards from the ground, behind the high altar, at the east end of the choir, where his body was solemnly placed in an iron chest within the said shrine, where it lay quietly without molestation, till the suppression of the church: And the book of the four evangelists which fell into the sea, and was so miraculously landed and found again, was laid on the high altar, as a fit monument to preserve the memory of so great a saint.</P>
<P>These holy bishops and monks, for the honour of their holy saint, Aldwinus, and Ranulph Flamberd, as bishop William Carileph intended at building the new church, on the outside of the north west turret of the same altars, erected the monument of a milk-maid milking her cow, in grateful commemoration of that maid, who so fortunately, in their great perplexity, directed them to Dunholme, where the body of their great saint was to rest until the resurrection: Which monument, though defaced by the weather, is visible at this time.</P>

<PB N="248" REF="260"/>to have it drawn, or to see it, the clerk of the feretory (called George Bates) gave notice to his master, the vice-prior, keeper of the feretory, who brought the keys of the shrine, and gave them to the clerk to open it. His office then was to stand by and see it drawn up. It was always drawn up in mattins time, when Te Deum was singing, or in high mass time, or at even-song time when Magnificat was sung. George Bates was register of the house.</P>
<P>There was in the keeping of the vice-prior, a banner belonging to the shrine, called St Cuthbert's banner, the staff five yards in length; all the pipes of it were of silver, to be slidden on along the banner staff, and on the uppermost pipe; on the top of it was a little silver cross, and a goodly banner cloth pertaining to it, and in the midst of the banner cloth was a white velvet half a yard square, and a cross of crimson velvet over it; and within the said white velvet was that holy relique, the corporax cloth, wherewith the holy man St Cuth∣bert covered the chalice when he said mass; and the rest of the banner cloth was of crimson velvet, embroid∣ered with gold and green silk most sumptuously. The said banner was at the winning of Brankenfield battle, in king Henry the Eighth's time, and brought home with it the king of Scots' banner, and many noblemen's an∣cients of Scotland; which were set up in St Cuthbert's feretory, where they remained till the suppression of the house; at which time St Cuthbert's banner, and these ancients of Scotland were defaced. St Cuthbert's ban∣ner was thought to be one of the most magnificent reliques of any in England, and was not carried out but on principal days, in general processions, as Easter day, Ascension day, Whitsunday, Corpus Christi day, and St Cuthbert's day, and some other festival days. It was very massy, and set up at the east end of the shrine. Whenever it was carried in procession, it was the clerk's office to attend it, with his surplice on, with a fine red painted staff, having a fork or cleft at the upper end thereof; which cleft was lined with soft silk, having down under the silk, to prevent hurting or bruising the pipes of the banner, which were of silver, or in taking it down and raising it up again, by reason of its great weight. There were always four men to go along with it, besides the clerk, and the man who carried it.</P>
<P>There was also a strong girdle of white leather, that he who bore St Cuthbert's banner, did wear whenever it was carried abroad. The banner was made fast to it with two pieces of white leather, and at each end of the two pieces, a socket of horn was fastened, to put the end of the banner staff into. Davies, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The north aile of the choir.</HEAD>
<P>At the east end of the north aile of the choir, betwixt two pillars, was the grandest porch, called the an∣chorage; having in it a very elegant rood, with the pictures of Mary and John, with an altar for a monk to say daily mass, being in ancient times inhabited by an Anchorite, whereunto the priors very much resorted, both for the excellency of the place, as also to hear mass, standing so conveniently unto the high altar, and withal so near a neighbour to the shrine of St Cuthbert. The entrance to this porch or anchorage was up a part of stairs adjoining to the north door of St Cuthbert's feretory, under which stairs the paschal did lie, and in the time of Lent, the children of the almery were enjoined to come thither daily, to dress, trim, and make it bright against the paschal feast.</P>
<P>In this north aile of the choir, betwixt two pillars on the south side, before St Blase's altar, afterwards called Skirlaw's altar, lies buried, Walter Skirlaw, bishop of Durham, under a fair marble stone, very sumptuously beset with many brazen images, having his own image most artificially portrayed in brass in the midst thereof.</P>
<P>Right over the entrance of this north alley, going to the song school, which was heretofore the sacrist's ex∣chequer, there was a porch adjoining to the choir on the south, and St Benedict's altar on the north; the porch having in it an altar, and the rood or picture of our Saviour, having sumptuous furniture for the festival days belonging to it.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The south aile of the choir.</HEAD>
<P>At the east end of the south aile of the choir, opposite to the aforesaid porch in the north alley, was a beautiful rood or picture of our Saviour, called the black rood of Scotland, with the pictures of Mary and John, brought out of Holy-rood house, in Scotland, by king David Bruce, and won at the battle of Durham, with the picture of our Lady on the one side of our Saviour, and St John on the other side; which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood and pictures were all richly wrought in silver and were smoaked back over, being a yard or five quarters long, and on every one of their heads, a crown of pure beaten gold, of goldsmith's work; with a device to take them off and to put them on. And on the backside of the said rood there was a piece of work that they were fastened unto, adorned with wainscot work and curious painting, from the midst of the pillar up to the height of the vault; which wainscot was red, varnished over, and set full of stars of lead, gilt with gold.</P>
<P>Thomas Hatfield, bishop of Durham, lies buried over against the revestry door, in the south aile of the choir, betwixt two pillars, under the bishop's throne, which he made before he died: His tomb being all of alabaster, whereunto was adjoined a little altar, which he prepared for a monk to say mass for his soul after his death; the altar being environed with an iron grate.</P>
<P>Within this south aile of the choir was the revestry, where the bishop or his suffragan had a peculiar altar, and used to say mass only at such times as they were to consecrate priests or give any holy orders.</P>

In this aile are the sacristaria and vestry rooms built by prior Hotoun, and opposite thereto the tomb of bishop Hatfield, <Q>who died in 1381, ornamented with as many coats of arms as would serve any German prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Pennant, 332, continues thus: <Q>Multitudes of other prelates and priors rested in this church, covered with beautiful tombs and brasses, swept away by the hand of Sacrilege in the time of Henry VIII. or of un∣distinguishing Reformation in succeeding reigns; or of Fanaticism, in the unhappy times in the last century.</Q></P>
<P>In the Antiquarian Repertory, vol. i. p. 178, is a plate of this tomb, with a back view of the upper decora∣tions of the throne.</P>
<P>The large vestry now used by the minor canons, was originally built by Henry de Luceby, who bishop Beke had caused to be elected prior in the room of prior Hotoun, whom he had expelled about the year 1300.

A corner of this superb monument rests on an ancient tombstone, and has preserved it from the general destruction which swept away the monumental inscriptions, when the new pavement was laid: A mistaken zeal in all reformations has pressed the parties headlong into an extreme, in many points as reprehensible as that which they tried to escape; for a vehement desire of eradicating superstition, urged sacrilegious hands against the monuments of those whose memories were dear to the learned, whose examples and virtues were worthy the emulation of succeed∣ing ages, and with a contempt that was at once irreligious and brutal, reformists rushed forward to deface memorials which they had not merit to purchase. To sweep away from the eye the mementos of monks, priors, and prelates of the con∣demned church, the tombstones were torn up, lest they should reproach the living with remembrance of the excellencies of the dead: A new pavement was laid down in the beginning of the last century. The monument which prompted this di∣gression, so far as the inscription is legible, covers the remains of Emery de Lomley, prior of the cell of Lathom, in Lancashire, dependant on this church; who was one that voted Robert de Graystanes might have the See of Durham <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Passez pur Lame Dom.

<P>In the south angle of the said nine altars, next to the Cemetery Garth, there was an almery, wherein sing∣ing bread and wine were usually placed; at which the sacristan caused his servant or scholar daily to give at∣tendance, from six of the clock in the morning, till high mass was ended, out of which to deliver singing bread and wine to those who did assist and help the monks to celebrate and say mass.</P>
<P>Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, lieth buried before the fourth of these altars, under a fair marble stone, whereon his own image was most curiously and artificially engraved in brass, with the pictures of the twelve apostles divided and bordered on either side, and other imagery work about it.</P>

There was also the picture of St Lau∣rence and his gridmon, with the arms and escutcheon of bishop Langley under him, viz. a crown of gold above his helmet, and within the crown, the crest, a bush of ostrich feathers, in red and green painted glass.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="267"/>The lower lights contain the story of St Oswald's beheading, and being on his bier accompanied by St Cuthbert and others, and the sun-beams shining on them, when they laid him on the bier; together with the story of St Laurence's death. In the cross division are four little lights, bearing four stars or mullets. At the top, were four turret windows, with our Saviour Christ, our blessed Lady, and other figures.</P>
<P>The altar of St Thomas of Canterbury and St Catherine, above which was a window with the like lights, containing the martyrdom of St Thomas in one light: And the story of St Catherine's being brought before the king and tortured on the wheel, with two angels separating the wheels; and after that her commitment to prison, and then looking out at a grate, and the beheading her afterwards in the king's presence; with certain arms and escutcheons, in the four turret windows, under the midst of the said window, divided, and the pic∣tures of four bishops, in four little turret windows, and the picture of our blessed Lady above all, in a blue habit.</P>
<P>The altar of St John the Baptist and St Margaret. The window above had St John the Baptist on the one side, with the lamb and cross in his hand, with these words, Ecce Agnus Dei. Under him a monk, called Thomas Batterby, in a blue habit, and these words, Adjuva me divine magister Sancte Cuthberte. Also his baptizing of Christ in Jordan; his being brought before Herod; and after that beheaded. Then follows St Margaret overcoming the dragon, with these words, Sancta Margareta; then being brought before the king, she was condemned, and by his command was hanged by the hair of the head, and drawn up by a windlass, and put into a tun of oil, which the fire would not consume, and so she was beheaded. And above all are four turret windows, containing the picture of our blessed Lady, and others finely coloured.</P>
<P>The fourth altar was surmounted by its window. In the first light was St Andrew with a cross over his body, and above his head, Sanctus Andreas. On the other side St Mary Magdalen, and under her Sancta Maria Magdalena; and the story of her kneeling at her prayers, and being brought before the king, and sen∣tenced to die; with some part of the story of Christ's anointing and visiting the sick. In the four turret win∣dows are the pictures of the four doctors of the church; St Augustine, St Hierome, St Ambrose, and St Gregory, in fine glass.</P>
<P>The altar of St Martin and St Edmund. In the window above, of the same architecture, was St Martin in a black habit, with a mitre on his head, and a staff in his hand, with a cross on the top thereof; above him these words, Sanctus Martinus archiepiscopus. In the same window were escutcheons charged with coats of arms; and the picture of a wicked spirit, in the likeness of a woman, who had got into the chamber and bed of St Edmund, intending to tempt the holy man to fornication; but she was so abhorred, that he with a rod did beat her out of his bed. Also the picture of St Edmund in a red episcopal attire, with a cross, having a staff under it, in his hand, and these words over him, Sanctus Edmundus episcopus. Above in the turret windows, was bishop Skirlaw's picture, and an angel finely painted on each side. On the other side, under St Edmund, were the arms of doctors and noblemen, on the breasts of four angels in four turret windows.</P>
<P>The altar of St Peter and St Paul, having the like window and lights, containing the picture of St Peter, with cross keys in his hand, and underneath, Sanctus Petrus: Here was the miracle of Peter's walking to∣wards Christ upon the sea. Under the middle stone work were the pictures of four escutcheons charged with arms. Then was represented St Paul persecuting the church at Damascus, and his being struck with blind∣ness, and the manner of his becoming an apostle, having written on his breast. Paule, Paule, quid tu me per∣sequeris? And afterwards his being brought before Caesar, and his being beheaded. And above were four little turret windows with four fine pictures, viz. St Cedda, St Cuthbert, St Aidane, and another bishop un∣known: And above all the picture of God.</P>
<P>The altar of St Aidane and St Helena, with the like windows and lights, presenting the picture of St Aidane in his episcopal attire, with a crosier in his hand; whose soul after his death was represented to be carried to Heaven in a sheet by two angels. In this were some part of the history of Christ, and the picture of a king and other saints; as also the picture of St Helena in a blue habit; and the picture of our Lady and the angel Gabriel appearing to her, and the Holy Ghost overshadowing her, with the lilly springing out of the lilly pot; and underneath the middle stone work were four angels. Above were four turret windows, with apostles, and the picture of God above all, in another little window, with Christ in his arms.</P>
<P>The altar of the archangel St Michael. Its window contained the pictures of eight several orders of angels, in eight several distinct pictures, viz. one angel, and under him written, Cherubins, Seraphims. A second, and under him, Arch-angeli. A third, and under him, Angeli. A fourth, and under him, Principatus. A fifth, and under him, Dominationes. A sixth, and under him, Potestates. And above all, in four turret windows, the pictures of four archangels winged, with wheels under their feet, and their names written on their wings. Above all, in one little tower window, the picture of God.—Davies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr Pennant says, <Q>Beyond this, at the extreme east end stood nine altars, dedicated to as many saints; above each is a most elegant window, extremely narrow, lofty and sharply arched: Above these is a round window, very large, and finely radiated with stone work, called St Catharine's wheel, from the form of the
<PB N="254" REF="268"/>wheel used at her martyrdom. In this part of the church is another fine window, divided into circular portions. All the windows in this isle terminate sharply; and were the work of a later age than that of the body of the church; probably the time of prior Fossour.</Q> Page 333.</P>
<P>It is to be observed that the fine paintings in these windows are almost totally defaced, or so mutilated and confused by bunglers who have repaired them, that the histories are not now to be made out, except the story of St Catherine.</P>

St Cuthbert's feretory projects twenty-seven feet into the transept, and is elevated

about eight feet above the pavement. This transept is lighted by one large window
<PB N="253" REF="267"/>
at each end, under pointed arches, with much tracery, in the glass of one of which
<PB N="254" REF="268"/>
was depicted the history of St Cuthbert, and in the other the history of Joseph, both now totally defaced: To the east it is lighted by a double range of windows, the lower tier consisting of nine long windows; in the center of the upper tier is a large circular window, called St Catherine's window, having three long windows on each side, the arches of which are all pointed. By the engraving given from Mr Nicholson's drawing and admeasurement of the whole east end of the church, the reader will distinguish the similarity of stile in this transept and the tower; and, we hope, will be convinced that the observation as to their date is not ill grounded: On the projections of this front are two effigies, in the printed descriptions of the church said to represent bishop William on the south, who began the present edifice; and on the north bishop Flambard, who translated St Cuthbert's body to the shrine pre∣pared for him therein; the first attired in his mitre and episcopal insignia, the other having his head uncovered: But it is more probable they are the effigies of bishop Farnham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob. 1257.</NOTE>, and his contemporary prior Thomas of Melsonby, for bishop Anthony Beke, who died in 1310, was interred near the altar of St Michael, and the wall was broken through to admit his remains; which is a proof this part of the edifice and its altars were then made. We will conclude these observations by saying, it is presumed this most elegant part of the edifice was finished by prior Richard de Hotoun, who, it is certain, roofed the choir, and acceded to the priory in 1289. The pilasters of this transept, from whence rise the groins of the roof, are of an angular projection, light and elegant: On each side of the great window the pilasters consist of a cluster of small circular columns, one of larger dimension in front, and six on each side to form the projecting angle, belted in two places at in∣tervals, with a triple roll, the capitals pierced in flowers; the pilasters between each window are composed of a front column, and four on each side, in an angler pro∣jection, belted and capitalled as the larger ones; every other column is of black marble, the intermediate ones of white free stone, which had a beautiful effect be∣fore they were, from the mistaken zeal of reformation, daubed over and concealed as they now remain, with washing and oker. Under each tier of windows a gal∣lery runs the whole length of the transept: The nine altars were placed one under each window to the east, the wall ornamented with short pilasters and open niches in the rose figure, exactly similar to the gallery of the dome: The vaulted roof is ribbed, the ribs meet on three circles; the silletings of the ribs are pierced like those of the choir, with roses and crosses: The circles are beautifully ornamented, the most northern one being pierced with a rich garland of flowers; that in the center is sculptured with four figures finely relieved, representing the evangelists
<PB N="255" REF="269"/>
kneeling, with their proper emblems: The southern circle is of elegant sculpture, exhibiting the revelation of Christ's nativity.</P>
<P>The gallilee at the west end of the church, as was observed before, was by ancient authors said to be appropriated by bishop Pudsey, for the reception of women, being originally designed for the service of processions: It is in breadth from east to west fifty feet, and from north to south eighty feet; divided into five ailes, by four rows of pillars, running east and west; three pillars and two pilasters, in each range; the pillars formed of four small round columns placed together, whose base is only two feet square; the pilasters consist of two round columns, de∣tached from the walls, their capitals ornamented with a leaf and mouldings; the arches are circular, and cut underneath and on the sides with the zig-zag figure; the roof is not vaulted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A plate in Smith's Life of Bede.</NOTE>: It is lighted with three large windows to the west, with flat or elliptic arches, and one smaller window at each extremity under pointed arches; to the south, four windows with pointed arches; the north side is built up, and used for the register's office: The old entrance was from the north, by a small yard adjoin∣ing to the church-yard, so that the women need not come within the gates of the church: The door circular, with pilasters and mouldings, greatly decayed. The gallilee on the south side is now stalled and benched for the bishop's consistory court<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><FIGURE>

<P>For the comfort of all women and solace of their soul, there was an ancient church in the Fern Island, where the church of that town now standeth; which was appointed for women to repair unto for hearing of mass, and receiving the sacraments. For which purpose here was a chapel dedicated to the blessed virgin Mary, now called the gallilee.</P>
<P>Hugh, bishop of Durham, considering the diligence of his predecessors in building the cathedral church, finished but a few years before his time, and no chapel being then erected to the blessed Virgin, whereunto it should be lawful for women to have access, began to erect a new work at the east angle of the cathedral, for which several pillars of marble were brought from beyond sea; and the work being advanced to a small height, begun, through great clifts therein, to fall down; whence it manifestly appeared unacceptable to God and holy St Cuthbert. Whereupon that work was left off, and a new one begun and soon finished, at the west end of the church for women</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="271"/>It is called the gallilee, by reason, as some think, of the translation thereof; being once begun, and after∣wards removed; to which place whosoever resorted, had the benefit of sundry pardons, as appears by a table there set up, containing a catalogue thereof.</P>
<P>Within the gallilee, in a chantry made of blue marble, stood our Lady's altar, a sumptuous monument, finely adorned with curious wainscot work; the wainscot furnished with pictures, in colours and gilding; there mass was sung daily by the master of the song-school, with certain deacons and choristers, the masters playing upon a fine organ in time of mass; wherein the founder, bishop Langley, was most devoutly prayed for: This bishop magnificently rebuilt the said gallilee. There belonged to this altar very sumptuous furniture, not only for principal feasts, but for ordinary service: And for safe-keeping those vestments, and other ornaments be∣longing to the said altar, there was at both ends behind the portal two close almeries of wainscot.</P>
<P>Thomas Langley, bishop of Durham, lies buried under a marble tomb, within the said chantry, before our Lady's altar.</P>
<P>On the north side of the gallilee was an altar, called the Lady of Pittie's altar, with her picture, carrying our Saviour on her knee, as he was taken from the cross. This altar was intended for a chantry priest to say mass at every day, having above the altar on the wall, a part of our Saviour's passion in large pictures, the other part being above St Bede's altar, on the south side.</P>
<P>There was on the south side, between two pillars, a beautiful monument of blue marble, a yard high, sup∣ported by five pillars, one at every corner, and the fifth under the middle; and above the said marble stone and pillars stood a second shrine, to St Cuthbert's, wherein the bones of St Bede were inshrined: It used to be taken down every festival day, when there was any solemn procession, and carried by four monks in time of procession and divine service. It is not improper to transcribe the following verses from the ancient history.</P>
<P>Hugh, bishop of Durham, having finished the chapel called the gallilee, caused a feretory of gold and silver to be made, wherein were deposited the bones of Venerable Bede. In the lower part of the work, the following Latin verses were engraven:
<Q><L>Continet haec Theca Bedae venerablis ossa,</L>
<L>Sensum factori Christus dedit atque datori:</L>
<L>Petrus opus fecit, Praeful dedit hoc Hugo donum:</L>
<L>Sic in utroque suum, veneratus utrumque Patronum.</L>
<L>Anno Milleno ter Centum, septuageno</L>
<L>Postquam Salvator carnem de Virgine sumpsit</L>
<L>Transtulit hoc Feretrum Cuthberti de prope tumba,</L>
<L>Istius Ecclesiae Prior hic, poscente Richardo</L>
<L>De Castro dicti Bernardi, cujus &amp; ossa.</L>
<L>Non procul hinc lapide sub marmoreo requiescunt.</L></Q></P>
<P>It appears that the bones of St Bede were first laid in the monastery of Jarrow, and afterwards brought to Durham, and placed in a golden coffin on the right side of the body of St Cuthbert.</P>
<P>Egfridus, a priest in that time, viz. 1319, did affirm, that one coffin contained both the body of St Cuthbert, and the bones of the venerable Dr Bede.</P>
<P>On the south side of the gallilee was St Bede's altar, before which his bones and reliques lay, where his shrine was, to whose memory an elegant epitaph fairly written on vellum hangs upon the adjoining wall.—See p. 259.</P>
<P>The reverend Sir George Wheler, knight, one of the prebendaries of this cathedral, a true admirer of Vene∣rable Bede, had several of his children buried near him, and ordered his own body to be interred as near Bede's tomb as it conveniently could, without violating the sacred ashes.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the bottom of the great window, in the west end of the gallilee, was a fine iron pulpit, with iron rails to support the monks in going up, of whom one did preach every holiday and Sunday, at one o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>At the west end of the south angle was a font for baptizing children, when the kingdom was interdicted by the pope; which Thomas Langley, bishop of Durham, procured as a privilege, upon special favour at the pope's hands.</P>
<P>In the west end of the gallilee are four finely coloured windows.</P>
<P>In the first towards the south are three lights; the middle having in it the picture of Christ crucified, curiously painted, with the sun and moon above the head thereof; in the highest part of which light is the picture of the star that appeared to the three wise men; together with the picture of the virgin Mary, with Christ naked, sitting upon her knee.</P>
<P>In the light towards the north, is pictured in coloured glass, the Almighty, having in his hand a ball or globe: And under that the Salutation; and the picture of the Holy Ghost appearing in the likeness of a dove.</P>
<P>In the light towards the south is the picture of our blessed Lady, as she was taken up into Heaven, glorified and crowned; and underneath a lively picture of our blessed Lady, with Christ new born, naked, sitting on her knee, and sucking her breast.</P>
<P>In the second, containing six fine lights of glass, severed, three above and three below.</P>
<P>The middle light above contains the picture of St Cuthbert, in his ordinary episcopal vestments, the image of St Oswald's head painted on his breast, supported with his right-hand, in fine coloured glass. Under his
<PB N="258" REF="272"/>feet is written, Sanctus Cuthbertus quondam Lindisfarnensis episcopus, hujus ecclesiae &amp; patriae maximus patronus.</P>
<P>The light on the north side of St Cuthbert has the picture of St Bede, in his blue habit; under his feet is wrote, Sanctus Beda, qui vitam St Cuthberti, &amp; multa alia, ab ecclesia approbata conscripsit; cujus ossa, in hac capella in feretro contenta.</P>
<P>The light on the south side of St Cuthbert hath the picture of Aidanus the bishop, in fine coloured glass, as he was accustomed to say mass; Under his feet is written, Sanctus Aidanus episcopus Lindisfarnensis ecclesiae primus; primus in hac sanctissima Dunelmensi ecclesia, fuit prioratus.</P>
<P>Under which three lights, by partitions, are three very curious and larger pictures, in fine coloured glass, containing the images of Aidanus, Edmundus, and Eata, three bishops of Lindisfarne, as they were accustom∣ed to say mass. Under Eata's picture is Sanctus Eata Lindisfarnensis episcopus.</P>
<P>And above, in the highest part of this window, are six little glazed lights, in tower manner, in fine coloured glass, containing part of the history of Christ's nativity, the marriage in Galilee, and his miracles done upon earth.</P>
<P>In the third window are also six lights parted as before; in the highest part are three pictures, in fine colour∣ed glass; the middle being the image of the blessed virgin Mary, with Christ in her arms, under whose feet is written, Sancta Maria.</P>
<P>On the north side of her is the picture of St Oswald, king, in coloured glass, with a beautiful cross in his hand; under whose feet is, Sanctus Oswaldus fundator sedis episcopalis Lindisfarnensis, quae nunc est Dunel∣mensis: Cujus anima in feretro St Cuthberti est humata.</P>
<P>On the south side of her is the picture of holy king Henry, in fine coloured glass, with his sceptre in his hand; under whose feet is written, Rex Henricus.</P>
<P>Under those, in three large lights, and first opposite to St Mary is placed the picture of Thomas Langley, bishop, as he used to say mass, having his arms excellently blazoned above his head; under whom is written, Thomas Langley, rector ecclesiae, ad honorem Dei, episcopus Dunelmensis; &amp; duas cantarias in eadem fun∣davit &amp; dotavit.</P>
<P>And under St Oswald's, is the picture of bishop Wilfridus, in fine coloured glass, as he used to say mass; under whose feet is, Sanctus Wilfridus primo Lindisfarnensis monachus, post abbas Ripensis, ultimo archiepis∣copus Eboracensis; uno anno rexit episcopatum Lindisfarnensem.</P>
<P>And under king Henry is the picture of bishop Cedda, in fine coloured glass, as accustomed to say mass; under his feet, Sanctus Cedda, primo Lindisfarnensis monachus, post abbas in Lestingham, tribus annis rexit archiepiscopatum Eboracensem, &amp; etiam rexit episcopatum Lichfeldensem.</P>
<P>In this window, above the former, are six little glazed tower windows, representing the flight of Joseph and Mary with our Saviour into Egypt, being pursued by Herod, together with most part of the story thereof.</P>
<P>In the fourth window also there are six fine lights, severed as before, containing in the higher part three large pictures in three lights, being the images of three holy kings, great benefactors to the church, and to St Cuthbert, viz. Alured, Guthred, and Elfrid, in their royal apparel, with scepters in their hands, in fine co∣loured glass.</P>
<P>Under them are, in large pictures, in fine coloured glass, three bishops of Lindisfarne, as they used to say mass: Under their feet is to be seen, Sanctus Egfridus Lindisfarnensis. Sanctus Ethelwoldus Lindisfarnensis.</P>
<P>Under the third, no writing to be seen, but Episcopus.</P>
<P>In the highest part of this window are six little tower windows, finely coloured and glazed, containing the most part of the story of Christ's death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, most excellently pictured in fine coloured glass.</P>

the circumstance of the arms above the entrances, we are led to conjecture that the gallilee in the present form is to be attributed to cardinal Langley, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, who, as was before observed, expended in reparations and additional works therein, 499l. 6s. 7d. The form of the pillars, and the center windows, with the various fragments of ornaments which appear in the outward wall to the west, strengthen the supposition that the present edifice was the cardi∣nal's. Bede died at Jarrow monastery in 734; was translated to this church by bishop Pudsey; and in 1340, found his final resting place under the care of Richard de Barnardcastle in the gallilee, who was interred near the remains <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>While his remains rested at Jarrow, great resort was made to his grave, and particularly one Elfrid, a priest of Durham, in the beginning of the eleventh century, came yearly upon the day of his death, and spent it in watching and prayer at his tomb; and such veneration he entertained for his remains, that he stole away his bones, and carried them to Durham. Being asked by his friends where they lay, he replied; "No one knows but myself;" and after being further pressed by them, he gave this answer, <Q>Believe me, beloved brethren, and be assured, the same chest that contains the most holy body of St Cuthbert, our father, holds also that of the venerable doctor and monk Bede.</Q></P>
<P>In 1054, when St Cuthbert was removed, the bones of Bede were found in the same chest; and afterwards they were enclosed in a separate chest. In 1154, they were again removed into the shrine made by bishop Pudsey, of pure gold and silver-smith work, enriched with jewels. Speed speaks of this tomb.</P></NOTE>: The like veneration induced cardinal Langley to repair and embellish this edifice, as he chose to have his body deposited near the saint: The cardinal also founded a chantry in the gallilee, to the honour of the blessed Virgin, and "glorious confessor St Cuth∣bert <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>1500.

<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The west alley of the cloisters.</HEAD>
<P>In the west alley of the cloisters, a little to the south of the dormitory door, was a strong house, called the treasury, having a strong door, and two locks upon it. In the midst of the house was a strong grate of iron fixed in the ground-work, and in the roof, and fastened in each wall the breadth of the house, so fast as not to be easily broken. In the midst of the grate was an iron door, with a strong lock, and two great slots of iron to guard it; and within the grate was a square table covered with green cloth, for telling their money. With∣in this treasury were also kept the evidences of the house, and the chapter seal; as also the evidences of several gentlemen's lands in the country, who thought them safer than in their own custody, in three great chests well locked in the said treasury, but afterwards it was altered; their treasure and money being kept in a strong house over the east gates of the abbey in the South Bailey, now called the exchequer; but in the said old treasury the common chapter seal is still kept.</P>
<P>Over-against the said treasury-house door was a stall of wainscot, where the novices were taught; no stran∣gers or other persons being permitted to molest the novices, or the monks in their carrels, while at study in the cloisters; a porter attending for that purpose at the cloister door.</P>
<P>A little south of the treasury was the song-school, for the instruction of boys, for the use of the choir; the song-school in the south isle of the lanthern being decently furnished with a reading desk, convenient seats, and all other requisites, where prayer was daily celebrated at six in the morning, except on Sundays and holidays.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The dormitory.</HEAD>
<P>On the west side of the cloisters was a large house, called the dorter, where the monks and novices lay. Every monk had a little chamber to himself. Each chamber had a window towards the chapter, and the partition betwixt every chamber was close wainscotted, and in each window was a desk to support their books. On the west side of the said dorter were the like chambers, with their windows and desks towards the infirmary and the water; the chambers being all well boarded.</P>
<P>The novices had likewise their chambers in the south end of the said dorter, adjoining to the aforesaid chambers, having eight chambers on each side. Every novice had his chamber to himself, not having any light but what came in at the foreside of their chambers.</P>
<P>At each end of the dorter was a square stone, wherein was a dozen of cressets wrought in each stone, being always filled and supplied by the cooks, as they needed, to afford light to the monks and novices, at their arising to their mattins at midnight, and for their other necessary uses.</P>
<P>There was a decent place adjoining to the west side of the said dorter, towards the water, called the privies. Two great pillars of stone supported the whole floor thereof; and every seat and partition was wainscotted close on every side.</P>
<P>In the dorter every night a private search was made by the sub-prior, who called at every monk's chamber∣door, to see good order kept, and that none should be wanting. The middle part of it was paved with fine tile stones the whole length: The sub-prior's chamber was the first, as he was to see order kept.</P>
<P>The sub-prior always dined and supped with the convent, sitting at the upper end of the table; and supper being ended, which was always at five o'clock, upon ringing a bell to call one of the novices to say grace, they went to the chapter-house to meet the prior, there to remain in prayer and devotion till six o'clock. Then upon ringing a bell again they went to the <HI>salvi,</HI> and all the doors of the cells, the frater-house, the dorter, and the cloisters, were locked, even at six o'clock, and the keys delivered to the sub-prior, till seven o'clock the next morning.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<PB N="262" REF="276"/>
<HEAD>The Loft.</HEAD>
<P>There was a door in the west end of the frater-house, at which the old monks entered, and then ascended up a pair of stairs, having an iron rail into a loft which was at the west end of the frater-house, above the cellar, where the convent and monks dined and supped together. The sub-prior sat at the upper end of the table, as chief; and they had their meat served from the great kitchen, in at the dresser-window, and brought through the frater-house: The said kitchen served both the prior and the whole convent, having two windows into the frater-house; the one was large for principal days, the other not so large for every day. At the foot of the stairs was another door, leading into the great cellar or buttery, where all the drink stood that served the whole convent.</P>
<P>This loft, since the dissolution of the monastry, was made the dining-room of the fifth prebendary's house.</P>
<P>The monks were accustomed every day after dinner, to go through the cloisters, in at the usher's door, and so through the entry under the prior's lodgings into the centry-garth, where the monks were buried, where they all stood bareheaded a good space, praying among the tombs for the souls of their brethren who were buried there: And when they had done their prayers, they returned to the cloister, and staid till three o'clock, that they went to even-song.</P>
<P>The monks were the only writers of the acts and deeds of the bishops and priors of the church, and of other chronicles and histories: They likewise recorded other most valuable things, as what acts, what occurrences, and what miracles were performed every year. Such were the labours of monks and religious men in ancient times.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The Common House.</HEAD>
<P>On the right hand at going out of the cloisters into the infirmary, was the common-house. It was to have a fire constantly by day in winter, for the use of the monks, who were allowed no other fire; but the master and officers of the house had their own several fires. A garden and bowling alley belonged to the said house, towards the water, for the novices to recreate themselves, leave being first granted; their master attending to see to their good order. In this house once in the year, between Martinmas and Christmas, the master of it kept his <HI>O Sapientia,</HI> a solemn banquet, at which the prior and convent were entertained with figs, raisins, ale, and cakes, but not to excess, being only a moderate scholastical congratulation among themselves.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The Infirmary.</HEAD>
<P>Within the infirmary, underneath the master's lodge, was a strong prison, called the lying-house, ordained for great offenders; as for monks guilty of felony or adultery, where they were imprisoned in chains a whole year, without seeing any one, except the master of the infirmary, in letting down their meat through a trap∣door by a cord, and that at a great distance from the prisoners. But if any of the temporal men belonging to the house offended in the premisses, they were punished by the temporal law.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The Guest-hall.</HEAD>
<P>A famous house of hospitality was kept within the abbey-garth, called the guest-hall and was situate on the west side towards the water. The <HI>terrer</HI> of the house was master thereof, appointed to give entertainment to all estates, noble, gentle, or what other degree soever came thither as strangers. Their entertainment was not inferior to that of any place in England, both for the goodness of their diet, the clean and neat furniture of their lodgings, and all things necessary for travellers; and no man was required to depart while he continued honest, and of good behaviour.</P>
<P>The houses belonging to the second, third, fourth and tenth prebendaries, were erected out of the apart∣ments and other offices belonging to the guest-hall, the hall itself being wholly demolished, nothing remaining except a part of the western wall: But nothing remains to let us know what was in the sixth and twelfth pre∣bendaries houses.</P>
<P>This hall was a stately place, not unlike the body of the church, supported on each side by very fine pillars, and in the midst of the hall a large range for the fire. The chambers and lodgings belonging to it were kept very clean, and richly furnished. They were very pleasant to lie in especially one chamber, called the king's chamber, well deserving that name; such was the stateliness thereof.</P>
<P>The victuals the guests were entertained with came from the great kitchen of the prior, the bread and beer from his pantry and cellars. If they were honourable, they were served as honourably as the prior himself, otherwise according to their quality.</P>
<P>The <HI>terrer</HI> had certain men appointed to wait at his table, and to attend upon his guests and strangers; and for their better entertainment he had always a hogshead or two of wines kept in a cellar pertaining to the said hall</P>
<P>The prior (whose hospitality was such as that, in reality there was no need of the guest-hall, but that the convent was desirous to abound in all liberal and free almsgivings) kept a most splendid and noble house being attended by the best gentlemen and yeomen in the country, and the magnificent service of his house deserved no less; constant relief and alms were daily given, not only to the poor of the city, but to those of the country round about.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="277"/>The lord prior had two porters, one at the hall door, called Robert Smith, the other at the usher door, at going from the great chamber to the church, called Robert Clark; which two were the last porters to the last prior.</P>
<P>There were certain poor children, called the children of the almery, who were educated in learning, and re∣lieved with the alms and benevolence of the whole house, having their meat and drink in a loft on the north side of the abbey gates, before the suppression of the said house. This loft had a long slated porch over the stair-head, and at each side of the said porch were stairs to go up to the loft, with a stable underneath it, and a door into it, under the stair-head, to go into the said stable. This edifice, at the suppression of the house, be∣came Mr Stephen Marley's lodging. Soon after the suppression he altered it, and took down the porch and stairs that went up to the loft, and made a kitchen where the stable was, and his buttery above where the loft was. The children went to school at the infirmary school without the abbey gates. The last schoolmaster was Sir Robert Hartburne, who continued master till the suppression of the house. He was bound to say mass twice a week at Magdalen's chapel, near Kepier, and once a week at Kimblesworth. The meat and drink these children had, was what the monks and novices with their master had left It was carried in at a door adjoining the great kitchen window, into a little vault at the west end of the frater-house, like a pantry, called the covie. Within it was a window, at which some of the children received the meat and drink out of the covie or pantry window, and carried it to the loft. This clerk waited on them at every meal to keep good order.</P>
<P>There were four aged women who lived in the infirmary, without the south gates of the abbey, each having her several chamber to lie in, being supplied and fed only with the victuals that came from the prior's own table.</P>
<P>In the infirmary was a chapel, where the schoolmaster of the infirmary, (having his chamber and school above it) or some other priest for him, was appointed to say mass to these aged women every holiday and Friday.—Davies, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The custom of the church of Durham in burying of monks.</HEAD>
<P>The monk, seized with sickness, was conveyed, with all his furniture, &amp;c. from his chamber in the dormi∣tory, to another in the infirmary, in order to have both fire and more convenient attendance; no fire being allowed in the dormitory.</P>
<P>And when his attendants perceived that he could not live, they sent for the prior's chaplain, who staid with him till he yielded up the ghost: Then the barber was sent for, whose office it was to put down the cloths and uncover him, and to put on his feet-socks and boots, and to wind him in his cowl and habit. Thence he was carried to a chamber called the dead man's chamber, in the infirmary, there to remain till night. At night he was removed into St Andrew's chapel, adjoining to the said chamber and infirmary, there to remain till eight o'clock in the morning, the chapel being a place ordained only for solemn devotion. The night be∣fore the funeral two monks were appointed by the prior to be mourners, and to sit all night on their knees at the feet of the corpse; and the children of the almery sitting on their knees, in the stalls on each side, were to read David's psalms till eight in the morning, when the corpse was carried to the chapter-house, where the prior and the whole convent met it, and there said their dirge; none being permitted to approach the chapter-house during the time of their prayers for his soul: When ended, the corpse was carried by the monks from the chapter-house through the parlour, the place where merchants used to utter their wares, standing betwixt the chapter-house and church-door, and so through the said parlour into the centry-garth, where he was buried and a chalice of wax laid upon his breast, having his blue bed held over his grave by four monks, during the funeral: Which bed is due to the barber for his duty aforesaid, and making his grave. At the time of his burial only one peal was rung.</P>
<P>The priors of the house of Durham, were accustomed in ancient time, to be buried in their boots, and wound in their cowls by the barber▪ as the monks used to be buried.</P>
<P>The priors, in later times, were buried within the church in the same order and habit, with the mitre and all other furniture, as their predecessors were buried.</P>
<P>The bishops of Durham used in ancient times to be buried in the chapter-house, they not presuming to lie nearer the holy body of St Cuthbert. Their names are graven upon the stones under which they lie, with a cross at the beginning of each name.</P>

<P>The custom of burying bishops in the chapter-house.</P>
<P>The bishops of Durham, when they died, were brought to the abbey church to be interred; and the prior and monks met the corpse at the church-yard gates on the place-green, where they received and carried him through the church into the chapter-house: Great solemnity and devotion, according to the ancient custom was used. The custom was, to bury them with their albe, stole, phannel, and other vestments wherein they used to say mass, a mitre on the head, and a crosier staff in his hand, and so laid in the coffin, with a little chalice of silver, other metal, or wax, placed on the breast; which wax chalice, and the knobs, and the edge of the patten or cover, and the base were gilded.</P>
<P>The prior and monks had the horses, chariot, and all other things that came with the deceased, due to them by ancient custom.</P>
<P>But afterwards the bishops were buried in the church; as their predecessors were in the chapter-house.</P>
<P>At the east end of the chapter-house there is a yard, called the centry-garth, where all the priors and monks were buried. In this garth was a vault made to be a charnel-house, to put dead men's bones in.</P>
<P>There were many gentlemen of great worth buried in the centry-garth, who desired to lie near holy St Cuthbert; and among others Mr Racket, who had a fine tomb of white marble, whereon he was pictured in brass, in his coat of armour, and his sword girt about him; and at every corner of the marble was an evangelist in brass.</P>
<P>Mr Elmeden was buried in the said garth, with a fine tomb-stone upon him: And divers others, whose monuments are perished.</P>
<P>The priors buried in the centry-garth had each a tomb-stone, either of marble or free stone, which dean Whittingham caused to be pulled down and taken away; and broke and defaced all such stones as had any pictures of brass, or other imagery work, or chalices wrought upon them; and the rest he took away, and employed them in making a washing-house.</P>
<P>Within the church were two marble holy water stones, bossed with hollow bosses on the outsides, curiously wrought. These were taken away by dean Whittingham, and removed into his kitchen.</P>
<P>In the centry-garth under the south end of the nine altars, betwixt two pillars, was a song-school, erected for teaching six children to sing, who had their meat and drink among the children of the almery, at the ex∣pence of the house. The master had his chamber adjoining to the song-school, and his diet in the prior's-hall, among the prior's gentlemen.—Davies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>William, bishop of Durham, before he took down Aldwinus's old fabrick, prepared a beautiful tomb of stone in the cloister-garth, a yard above the ground, where St Cuthbert was deposited, over which was laid a large marble. But when his body was translated to the seretory, made a large and curious marble image, repre∣senting St Cuthbert, with beautiful gilding and painting, in the form he was wont to say mass, which was placed upon the tomb-stone as soon as his body was inshrined in the new church, and round the same were set up wooden stanchels, so close that a man could only look through it, to view that exquisite picture. It was covered above with lead, not unlike a chapel. This elegant monument stood opposite to the parlour door, now turned into a store-house, having rooms above where the register-office is kept. Soon after the suppres∣sion, dean Horne demolished this fine monument, converting the lead to his own use; the image of St Cuth∣bert he left perfect. But when dean Whittingham began to govern, he caused this image to be defaced and broken.</P>

<P>Bishops Skirlaw and Langley were the builders of the cloisters. The first gave two hundred pounds in his life-time, and by will four hundred pounds, for that purpose. The second gave two hundred and thirty-eight pounds seventeen shillings and six-pence. These two were at the charge of the building and workmanship, and caused to be painted on the glass in the windows, from the cloister door to the church door, the whole story and miracles of St Cuthbert. In king Edward the Sixth's days, this history was taken down by dean Horne, and broken to pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="280"/>There was a godly ceremony practised by the prior and monks every Maunday Thursday, viz. the Thurs∣day before Easter. Eighteen aged poor men were appointed to come to the cloister that day, having their feet first clean washed, there to remain till the prior and the convent came, which was about nine o'clock. They sat between the parlour door and the church door, on a long form, and the prior washed the poor men's feet, one after another, and dried them with a towel, and kissed them. When he had done this, he bestowed thirty pence in money, on each of them, and seven red herrings a-piece; and served them with drink, three loaves of bread, and certain wafer cakes.</P>
<P>At going out of the cloisters, through an entry into the deanry, at the top of the stairs, behind the door called the usher-door, on the right-hand, was another going into the register, wherein certain old written books of the records and evidences of the house were laid; as also a copy of the foundation of Greatham hospital, which was also registered in the said book of records. It was the register-house, till Tobias Matthew, dean of Durham, removed it into the parlour before mentioned.</P>

east walk was the old library, now converted into offices for the register, a council chamber, and other conveniencies for the chapter's business: In this walk is the chapter-house, in length seventy-five feet, and thirty-five in breadth, a neat build∣ing, in the form of a theatre, vaulted with stone, without any pillars; the side walls are ornamented with pilasters and intersecting arches, like the church: It is lighted by five windows at the semicircular end to the east, two side lights, and one to the west: The groins of the vault spring from corbles supported by human figures, in the manner Atlas is usually represented; the mouldings of the ribs are cut with the zig-zag figure: three rows of stone benches, one above another, run round the building: To the eastward of the center is a stone chair, with much carved work, the bishop's seat in old times when he visited, and wherein the prelates are installed. Adjoining to the chapter-house, on the south, was a prison for offending monks; and at the south end of the cloister there is a passage into the cemetery garth. The building of the chapter-house was originally the work of bishop Rufus, about the year 1136, but it was afterwards vaulted and embellished by succeeding prelates, particularly by bishop Skirlaw, to whom much of the present edifice is ascribed. In this place were interred at the east end, bishop Rob<SUP>t</SUP> de Insula, and bishop Kellow; further to the west, bishops Rufus, William de Sancta Barbara, and bishop Flam∣bard; near to those bishop Pudsey, and Philip of Poictiers; westward of those, bishops Richard de Marisco, Aldune, Walcher, Turgot the prior, and bishop Stichill; and on each side of the entrance, bishops Walter de Kirkham, and Richard de Farnham: Robert de Graystanes was also interred here. Davies and the old roll place some other bishops in the chapter-house, but are the only authorities we find.

<P>The Rev. Mr Rud made a catalogue of the MSS. from A. 1, to B. 11. N<SUP>o</SUP> 36, and gives as a preface this ac∣count of them: "Si aliquot codices minus utiles inter has inveniantur, quod minime mirum videri debet in∣tanto librorum numero, quorum multi iis seculis scripti sunt quibus omnes pene literae crassis ignorantiae tene∣bris obrutae jacuerunt; multi tamen, sive argumentum, sive antiquitatem, sive scribendi artificium, et ele∣gantiam spectemus▪ eximij plane et quantivis pretij reperientur: Sunt enim in illis qui mille annos supe∣rant, et plures patrum Latinorum libri ante annos 600 exarati sunt, Willielmus enim primus episcopus, a Sancto Carilepho dictus, monasticae disciplinae in his regionibus instaurator praecipuus, monachos quos in ec∣clesiam Dunelmensem primus introduxit, non religionis modo &amp; pietatis, sed doctrinae etiam et eruditionis exercitiis impendere voluit. Ejus igitur jussu et impensa multos bonos libros pulcherrime descripserunt, quorum nomina bibliis quae hinc caenobio dedit praefiguntur, eorum non pauci liviis etiam supersunt ut in hac bibliotheca servantur. Idem et de sequentibus episcopis &amp; prioribus observare liceat."</P>
<P>The finest of all the MSS. is that of the bible, in four volumes folio, having in the front of the first volume written,—Liber Hugonis Dunelm. epi, who was made bishop in the year 1153, and died in 1194, so that this MS. is six hundred years old, which being the gift of Pudsey, may be reckoned for the grandeur and beauty of it amongst his other great works. Mr Rud's description, "Est egregius revera liber Scriptus est si qui∣dem literis majoribus iisq. accurate formatis atramento nitenti in membranis pulcherrimis, capitulorum prin∣cipia literis pictis exornantur Librorum autem singulorum initia literis maximis variis coloribus et auro de∣pictis illustrantur. Et sane tanta est operis pulchritudo, tantus nitor (nisi nota apposita et ipsa scripturae ratio et forma testaretur librum esse 500 annis vetustiorem) vix videri possit ad 100 annos assurgere.

The whole square of the cloister is vaulted underneath, supported on short columns, and totally dark, in its various ailes like a labyrinth, from whence the return is not easily found; a melancholy recess for religious severity, penitence, or punishment! It is formed of excellent mason work, and did it not strike the visitor with horrible ideas of mistaken austerity, is as admirable as many other parts of the sacred edifices. The only entrance is a narrow and low arched way under the library, opening into the deanry kitchen court.

On the opposite side are the sessions-houses, to the building of which bishop Cofin greatly contributed; we are told he gave 1000l. towards public erections, and among them the sessions-house and exchequer are named, which latter contains the hall where the chancery-court is held, and offices for the auditor, cursitor, pro∣thonotary, county-clerk, and register, originally built by bishop Nevill <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In bishop Neile's time an order was made for dividing the office of cursitor and register in chancery, and appointing distinct officers therein.</NOTE>. Before the new sessions-houses were erected, the adjoining building was used for the law courts, under which are stables; the upper chamber is a mean and melancholy place for so important a purpose: The ornaments of the seat of justice were removed from thence in 1649 <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>Sess. 11 July, 1649.</P>

with books by bishop Cofin; adjoining is the exchequer, which closes that side of the square up to the gates entering into the outward court of the castle. At the north east corner of the Green, Queen's-street, anciently called Owen or Ounsgate, descends to the north gate, now the gaol; and at the south-east corner Sidgate, vulgarly called Dun Cow-lane, leads to King's-gate, crossing the North-Bailey: On the north side of the square is the castle: There are few distinct remains of the wall which defended this part, between the castle and the church; the name of the broken walls being the chief memorial of that fortification.</P>
<P>The Place-Green, as before noted, we apprehend was the ground where crimi∣nals were executed; it being the ancient custom to perform such acts of justice be∣fore the walls of castles, and not to carry offenders from their prisons to distant places, or to delay execution after sentence.

We would not have multiplied these proofs, but to deduce from thence the following observations: It has been apprehended that the mintage of our prelates was carried on in some strong place within the gates of the castle; or as others would have it, in Silver-street, from its name; whereas the records prove the mint-master's house was on the Place-Green; which was stiled to be in the castle, as being within the ballium and fortifications thereof.</P>
<P>There were anciently belonging to the monastery two schools, one in the cloister where the novices were taught, in a wainscotted hall opposite to the treasury door. The master was one of the oldest and most learned of the monks, and the students were supplied, upon his report, with necessaries from the chamberlain of the house; for they had no appointed salary. If any of them shewed a particular genius and love of literature, he was sent to Oxford; those of meaner capacities pursued their
<PB N="273" REF="287"/>
studies under the discipline of the house, were taught to perform the service of the choir, and in the end admitted to sing mass; at which stage they had twenty shil∣lings a year as wages: They had commons at a table at the east end of the frater-house, and during the mess one of them read a portion of the holy scriptures. Their lodging was at the south end of the dormitory. The other school was in the infirmary out of the abbey gates, where the boys of the almery were taught; they messed after the novices, and had the remains of their table: Their master had ec∣clesiastical duty, saying mass twice a week at St Mary Magdalen's chapel, near Kepier, once a week at Kimblesworth, and every holiday and Friday in the infir∣mary chapel, where four women constantly attended, who dwelt in the infirmary, to take care of the sick, and were supplied with provisions from the priors table<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide auditor's office.</NOTE>. These appointments, with the rest of the monastic dispositions, were extinguished by the dissolution, and perhaps occasioned the institution of the other schools after the settlement of the chapter. John Newton, master of St Edmond's hospital, in Gateshead, and John Thoralby, rector of Gateshead, and afterwards of Whitburn, clerks, by bishop Langley's licence, dated the 14th of June, 1414, founded two chanteries at the altars of the blessed Virgin and St Cuthbert, in the gallilee, and appointed two chaplains, one of whom was to teach poor boys grammar, and the other singing, in such place as that prelate or his executors should appoint: Their stipend of forty shillings yearly each, issued out of lands in Hardwick, nigh Norton, Ryton, Boldon, Cassop, and Owengate, in the North-Bailey. The boys, it is pre∣sumed, from the instrument of confirmation by the prior and convent were to con∣sist of thirty of the monastery almery: The song-master, with some of his scholars, were to come to church on the principal festivals in a surplice, and sing; the others to be present on the like occasions; and no women were to be permitted among them: The chantry clerks were not suffered to lie a night out of their house, with∣out licence of the bishop, or his spiritual chancellor, under the penalty of forfeit∣ing the chantry; neither might they, (with any licence) be absent above forty days <HI>conjunctim aut divisim</HI> in a whole year, and then to have a substitute. They could not be admitted without licence of the bishop, or during the vacancy of the prior and chapter, in which express mention was to be made of their taking the oath of residence. The bishop had power to add to or detract from the articles of founda∣tion, to appoint statutes, or alter and explain them at pleasure <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">3d Chartulary, p. 284, 285, 286, 287.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There appears some confusion touching these chantries; whether only one was founded by Newton and Thoralby, and the other was the act of bishop Langley; for in the nomination of some of the clerks, one of them is called bishop Langley's chantry. Bishop Nevil, in the first year of his episcopacy, granted licence to the executors of bishop Langley, to purchase lands of forty pounds per annum value, for maintenance of these chantry clerks <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide Rot.

After the dissolution, it is to be apprehended, things of this nature remained some time in confusion; two new schools were instituted in the second year of queen Mary, under the protection of the dean and chapter; and the queen appointed stipends to be paid thereto, out of the revenues of the church: And though it doth not appear the dean and chapter had any right to intermeddle with the money issuing out of Kaverdley, in Lancashire, yet certain it is, a custom arose in the beginning of queen Elizabeth's reign, to pay one half of the stipend that belonged to one of bishop Langley's schools, to the master of the new grammar-school, and the same hath been regularly paid by the king's auditor. One reason for this division might be, that from the time of the foundation of the new school, where the Latin tongue was to be taught, that language was disused in the other, and it was appropriated for Eng∣lish rudiments and writing. Bishop Langley's song-school hath long fallen into dis∣use; the patentee pays no attention to the institution, and it has become a beneficial sinecure to some of the bishop's domestics<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Patents. 26 Aug. 1681.

<HEAD>The Bishop's Alms-House, and Schools on the Green.</HEAD>
<P>Bishop Cosin's deed of foundation of the alms-houses on the Place-Green, and re-establishment of the schools there, is to the following effect:</P>
<P>"John, by God's grace and permission, bishop of Durham: To all the faithful sons of Christ and holy mother church, that may see or hear these present letters, or this public instrument, health and blessing. For as much, as among other works of piety and exercises of Christian religion, which appertain to the office of a bishop, we were diligently to provide and take care, that our episcopal castles, and in them especially our chapels, and some other places and buildings adjoining, destined for public uses, (all which indeed we found almost quite destroyed either by the violence of the times, or the neglect and malice of men) might be duly repaired as soon as possible, and where necessary rebuilt. Know ye, therefore, that we have not only repaired, and brought into better form, in every part, our foresaid episcopal castles, and the sacred chapels therein, at our own proper charges, but also have built anew two school-houses, anciently erected by the appointment of the most reverend prelate and lord, lord Thomas Langley, our predecessor, on the bishop's palace-green, in
<PB N="276" REF="290"/>
Durham, on the east side of the said green; (lately almost fallen and left waste by the violence of the times and neglect of men) the one of which schools was designed for instructing boys in the rudiments of learning, unto the Latin and Greek gram∣mar; and the other to instruct boys in the art of writing and plain songs; with a stipend of 8l. 6s. 8d. annexed, for the master of each school, to be paid yearly by the king's officers; and with a pension in like manner of forty shillings, to be paid by the officers of us and our successors, viz. our auditor and receiver, yearly to the same master; which we have thought good, as much as in us lies, should be ratified and confirmed. Know ye, furthermore, that we the bishop aforesaid, have built and placed between the same schools, another building or alms-house, containing in it eight chambers for the entertainment and dwelling of so many poor people, viz. four men and four women. And now for the due maintenance and support of the same poor men and women, and the repairs of the houses aforesaid, when such shall be needful, we make known unto all, that by this our charter, we give and grant an annuity of seventy pounds, to issue out of the manor or lands of Great-Chilton, in the county of Durham, lately bought with our own proper monies, to be distributed among the same poor men and women, and duly to be paid yearly, at four quar∣ters of the year, according to an indenture made between us on the one part, and the honourable Charles lord Gerard, baron of Brandon, together with Sir Henage Finch, knight and baronet, the king's solicitor, Sir Gilbert Gerard, knight and baronet, our high-sheriff in the county palatine of Durham, Sir Nicholas Cole, of Kepier, in the county of Durham, knight and baronet, and George Davenport, clerk, rector of Houghton-le-Spring, in the county of Durham aforesaid, our trustees on the other part; and bearing date the 12th day of August present, as it may appear more fully by the said indenture. Therefore we will and ordain by this our charter, that the aforesaid sum of seventy pounds, for the maintenance and support of eight poor people, living in our hospital or alms-house aforesaid, and for the repairs thereof, be distributed and paid yearly in this manner as followeth. First of all, shall be paid to each of the eight poor people aforesaid, by the bishop's auditor and receiver, the yearly pension of 6l. 13s. 4d. at four feasts of the year, specified in the aforesaid indenture, by equal portions: Secondly, that to each of the said poor people be given yearly, by the said auditor and receiver, at the feast of St Bartholomew, 15s. for buying coals or fuel, and repairing their chamber windows, as oft as need shall require: Thirdly, that the sum of 5l. every year be re∣tained in the hands of the said auditor and receiver of the bishop of Durham for the time being, for buying gowns (called liveries) for the said poor men and women,
<PB N="277" REF="291"/>
every third year: Fourthly, that the sum of 20s. in like manner be placed in the hands of the said auditor and receiver, for repairing the said houses when it may be needful: Fifthly, that the sum of 4l. in like manner, be paid duly at the feasts aforesaid, by equal portions, unto some honest woman, to be named by us and our successors, bishops of Durham, that may daily attend upon the aforesaid poor people, in their sickness and other necessity: Lastly, that the aforesaid auditor and receiver reserve in their hands yearly 13s. 4d. to purchase gloves, as a token for their at∣tention and care. Furthermore, we will and ordain, that all such poor people, be∣ing bachelors or widowers and widows, be of honest repute and good conversation, and sixty, or at least fifty years of age; whereof three men and so many women shall be natives, or at least inhabitants of Durham, by the space of twenty years: But the other two, that is, one man and one woman, shall be chosen out of the vil∣lage or parish of Brancepeth: The cure of which church we anciently had; to be nominated by us during our life, but after our death by our beloved daughters the lady Mary Gerard, the lady Elizabeth Burton, Mrs Frances Gerard, alias Blakeston, and Mrs Anne Greenvile, in their turns after the order of their ages, and by the longer livers and longer liver of them: And after the death of them all, by our successors, the bishops of Durham in a full See; but by the dean and chapter of our cathedral church of Durham, in a vacancy, from time to time as often as any place of the said poor men and women shall happen to be void, for ever. And that this pious and charitable intention of ours may take better effect, we have chosen, named, assigned, and constituted, and by these presents for us and our successors, do choose, name, assign, and constitute our beloved in Christ, William Unthanke, William Widdrington, Robert Blunt, and Charles Calvert, and our beloved Grace Hutchin∣son, Jane Cummin, Eleanor Pearson, and Mary Atkinson, to be the first poor men and women of the same hospital or alms-house, there to remain to be maintained and relieved during their natural lives; unless in the meanwhile they be removed, or that it shall happen that any one of them be removed thence for some reasonable cause, by us and our successors. We will also, and ordain, that all such poor people, and their successors, shall reside and lodge in their own chambers. Fur∣thermore, we appoint that the poor men and women shall duely say not only the private prayers assigned to them, by us, in their own chambers; but also frequent the prayers morning and evening, in the choir of our cathedral church in Durham, unless they be detained at home by some real sickness: That they all go to church, two by two, both men and women, in their gowns, modestly, decently, and in or∣der: That they shall sit next after the king's beadsmen, sounded in the same cathe∣dral church; and there demean themselves humbly and devoutly. Lastly, we will and constitute, that all such poor people be subject as well to the ordinary juris∣diction of us and our successors, as to all decrees, commands, and statutes, duely and lawfully to be established and ordained by us and our successors, bishops of Durham. And we do hereby declare, as well the said schools, restored and built by us, as also our new and peculiar foundation of the said alms-house, shall be established for ever. We put up our most humble thanks to the Omnipotent and Gracious Divinity, who hath vouchsafed to grant unto us, whilst we sojourn in this
<PB N="278" REF="292"/>
mortal life, and look for his blessed eternity in Heaven, ability to provide for, and perfect these our works of piety and charity, which we trust will be acceptable to him. In testimony, &amp;c. we have caused these our letters to be made patent, and thereto have put our seals, both episcopal and palatine. Witness, Sir Francis Goodrick, knight, our temporal chancellor.

<HEAD>THE COUNTY COURT.</HEAD>
<P>The sheriff is judge of the county court, and all proceedings there are before him; and yet the office of county clerk hath, time out of mind, been granted by the bishop by patent for life, and such patentee issues all processes, and all pleadings are in his office, and he receives to his own use all the profits thereof. And where the debts and damages are above 13s. 4d. the process is capias I observe in some reasons offered against taking away the county palatine, it is mentioned, that in 1665, there was some attempt to discourage the practice of arresting by capias; and that the grand jury made a representation in writing to the judges at the assizes, of the great conveniencies arising to the county by it, and that the same was also signed by the mayor and aldermen, and the attornies, and publicly read at the assizes; and that the said custom of issuing capias was approved and allowed by the judges. And in 1666, at the assizes of Durham, one <HI>Potter</HI> being in gaol upon a capias, issued out of the county court, moved by Mr Stot, for a habeas corpus to bring the defendant to the bar; and the sheriff in his return set forth the custom of arresting by capias, and the defendant was brought to the bar, and the matter argued by councel; the councel for the defendant at the bar agreed the custom was good and the defendant was remanded. There was also a writ of false judgment brought by <HI>Dale</HI> at suit of <HI>Hall,</HI> and the awarding of a capias was assigned for error. Sir T. Tursden, upon hearing coun∣cel on both sides, took time to consider of the error, and afterwards declared, he had consulted with his brethren, the judges, at Westminster, who were of opinion, that the custom being in the county palatine by prescription might be good, and gave orders for affirming the judgment. In the year 1668, three writs of false judgment were brought by <HI>Nicholson</HI> against <HI>Huntley,</HI> and the awarding the capias again assigned for error; after argument before baron Rainsford, he was attended again at Newcastle, and appointed the same to be further argued at his chambers in Serjeant's Inn, when he said he had consulted his brethren, who were of opinion the custom was good, and affirmed the judgment; and ordered Mr Cooke, the associate, to draw a special rule, and set out the custom, which was done.</P>

<P>The office or place of county clerk hath, time out of mind, been disappendant as to the high sheriff's office, who has never received any profit of the said court, though he hath always exercised and enjoyed the office of judge of and within that court; and that all pleadings within that court have been held before the sheriff, and not otherwise. The said court hath, time out of mind, had the lawful and unquestioned jurisdiction, in all cases therein to award a capias upon a justicies, directed to the sheriff, and no other person whatever, which is done at a small charge.

<P>The court commonly called the county court, in fact is a court holden before the sheriff of the county, and so it is stiled in writs of false judgment; which distinguishes this court from all other county courts properly so called, and of which the suitors are judges, and they are said to be holden <HI>coram sectatoribus.</HI> See I.

<P>enters by the gateway built by bishop Tunstall.</P>
<P>Before we proceed in the description of the present edifice, it is necessary to make some few observations on the form and construction of fortresses of the like date. We remarked, that it was probable there was a place of strength and defence on the castle hill, before the Conqueror, returning from his Scotch expedition, thought it expe∣dient in this province, which was so necessary and natural a barrier against the more northern powers, to erect a castle <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide note vol. i. p. 113.</NOTE>. The castle upon Tyne was a work of near the same period of time <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Hoc anno Gul. rex misit Robertum silium suum contra Malcolinum regem qui cum pervenisset ad Egles∣breth nullo consecto negotio, castellum novum super slu. sini condidit.—<BIBL>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Col. vol. ii. p. 384.</BIBL></P></NOTE>, but the form of that edifice in no wise corresponds with any part of the fortress now under consideration, and indeed it is difficult to determine what part of the present castle owes its origin to William the Conqueror. Towers of an octagonal form, we conceive, were not uncommon with the Normans; yet we do not apprehend the present tower was of Norman architecture: The lofty mount most probably attracted the founder's attention: But we have met with very little evidence to support such a position. The ingenious Mr Grose says <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>Vol. i. Antiq. of England and Wales, 2d edit. p. 7.</P>
<P>In Leland's Itinerary we have the following description. <Q>The close itself of the minstre on the highest part of the hill is welle wauled, and hath diverse fair gates.

<Q>The materials of which castles were built, varied, according to the places of their erection; but the manner of their construction seems to have been pretty uni∣form. The outsides of the walls were generally built with the stones nearest at hand, laid as regularly as their shapes would admit; the insides were filled with the like materials, mixed with a great quantity of fluid mortar, which was called by the workmen grout-work: A very ancient method of building used by the Romans, and quoted by Palladio, and all the writers on architecture. The angles were always coigned, and the arches turned with squared stone, brought from Caen, in Normandy, with which the whole outside was now and then eased. Sometimes instead of stone the insides of the walls were formed with squared chalk, as is the castle of Guildford. When the Normans found the ruins of an ancient building on the scite of their intended structure, they either endeavoured to incor∣porate it into their work, or made use of the materials; as may be seen by many buildings of known Norman construction, wherein are fragments of Saxon archi∣tecture, or large quantities of Roman bricks, which has caused them often to be mistaken for Roman or Saxon edifices. The general shape or plan of these castles depended entirely on the caprice of the architects, or the form of the ground intended to be occupied; neither do they seem to have confined themselves to any particular figure in their towers, square, round, and poligonal, oftentimes occur∣ing in the original parts of the same building. The situations commonly chosen were steep rocks, cliffs, eminences, or the banks of rivers.</Q> To this observation we must add, that the fortifications on the ground now under consideration, occupied or enclosed the whole summit of the hill; the outward wall running along the very brink of the eminence, and forming an oval figure; at the northern extremity of which the castle stands, on the neck of land, where the ground descends swiftly to the lower town, called the borough; the river runs almost round the whole walled or fortified eminence, except at that part where Claypath or Cluerport gate stands; at which point, the eastern or western channels drawing nearest together, give the walled or fortified part of the town the figure of a horse shoe, so that the river to those fortifications served in lieu of a moat: The natural ascent from the river to the foot of some parts of the city wall, is upwards of eighty perpendicular feet. <Q>In towns (Mr Grose says, p. 9) the appellation of <HI>ballium</HI> was given to any work fenced with palisades, and some times masonry, covering the suburbs; but in castles
<PB N="281" REF="295"/>
was the space immediately within the outer wall. When there was a double enceinte of walls, the areas next each wall were stiled the outer and inner ballia. The manner in which these are mentioned in the siege of Bedford castle, suf∣ficiently justify this position: <HI>The castle was taken by four assaults; in the first was taken the barbican, in the second the outer ballia, at the third attack the wall by the old tower was thrown down by the miners, where, with great danger they pos∣sessed themselves of the inner ballia, through a chink; at the fourth assault the miners set fire to the tower, so that the smoke burst out, and the tower itself was cloven to that degree, as to shew visibly some broad chinks, whereupon the enemy surrendered.</HI>— This receives further confirmation from the enumeration of the lands belonging to Colchester castle, wherein are specified "the upper bailey, in which the castle stands, and the nether bailey, &amp;c." The wall of the ballium in castles was com∣monly high, flanked with towers, and had a parapet, embattled, crenellated, or garretted for the mounting of it. There were flights of steps at convenient dis∣tances; and the parapet often had the merlons pierced with long chinks, ending in round holes, called oillets.</Q> Whether, at Durham, there was an inner and outer ballium, is uncertain; the two streets now called the Baileys, are sometimes distinguished by the names of the high and low Bailey, and north and south Bailey, and prompt an idea, that such might be the original form of the fortification; but when the present cathedral church was built, the distinction and interior wall per∣haps was removed, as no remains thereof now appear.</P>
<P>Within the ballium were lodgings or barracks, for those whose service it was to defend the castle personally, either as principals or substitutes; so in the Baileys the houses were anciently held in capite by the service of castle ward, and many chief personages had tenements therein for greater security in times of public danger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The families of Alenshelys, and de Le Ley.

On an eminence, in the center commonly, though not always, stood the keep or dungeon, sometimes, as in the siege of Bedford castle, emphatically called the tower; it was the citadel or last retreat of the garrison, often surrounded by a ditch, with a draw bridge and machicolated gate, and occasionally with an outer wall, garnished with small towers: In large castles it was generally a high square tower, of four or five stories, having turrets
<PB N="282" REF="296"/>
at each angle; in these turrets were the staircases, and frequently as in Dover and Rochester castles, a well. If instead of a square, the keep or dungeon happened to be round, it was called a juliet, from a vulgar opinion that large round towers were built by Julius Caesar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grose's Antiq. vol. i. 2d edition, p. 11.</NOTE>.</Q> We find mention made of five gates to the bal∣lium: The great north gate, which flanked the keep to the east, and filled up the space between it and the wall, which led down into the borough: This was of the greatest strength, as it commanded the most important and least guarded approach: When it was rebuilt by bishop Langley, he thought it necessary to make it as strong as the art of fortification could then render it, not only as a defence to the fortress and monastery, but as a prison for criminals and captives, without lodging them in the cells and vaults of the great tower; to those ends he constructed the gateway <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Janitores Portae inferioris castri Epor Dun.</L>

Henry Egerton, one of the present prebendaries of Durham, having purchased the adjacent grounds, widened the street, and promoted the building of a spacious arch, of Roman architecture, without gates, in the place of the old gateway: This would have proved little more than an ornament to the city, had not the dean and chapter, with a munificence which distinguishes that worshipful body in all their public works, laid it open for the use of gentlemen's families; whose carriages only are permitted to pass along the elegant new bridge, lately erected by them: A bounty reserved to this age.</P>
<P>At this gate the ancient wall of the ballium appears, stretching along the brink of the hill towards the church of St Mary-le-Bow, where King's-gate anciently stood. The wall is defended at intervals with square projecting turrets or bastions; but few of them retain so much of their original figure as to furnish a probable conjecture touching their strength, when in a perfect state: The wall shews evident marks of a parapet and breast wall or embrazure.</P>
<P>In the first volume, page 113, we offered some conjectures relative to the castle: It is pretty well established that William the Conqueror ordered a fortress to be erected here; and it is probable, the works which then defended the mount, attract∣ed the attention of the Norman; whether those works merited the name of a castle is not easy to determine, or what they really were; though from the mode of the Saxons, we may presume they consisted of breast works or circumvallations, of which the present terraces may be some remains. Huntingdon's language, touching the sovereigns erecting a castle here <HI>de Novo,</HI> prompts an idea, that some considerable edifice stood on this ground before the Norman times <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The reader is desired to correct an error in p. 113, touching the castle, and read <HI>encourages</HI> for <HI>discourages,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ase the following <HI>and.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="298"/>About the year 1177, the castle of Durham consisted chiefly of a tower; in the note referred to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Rex (Hen.

When Framwellgate bridge was built by bishop Flambard, in the opening of the twelfth century, he carried on a strong wall between the castle and the church; and it is probable he built the last mentioned towers to command the pass: The bridge had also a strong gateway and tower: Building this bridge necessarily occasioned a passage to be made from thence into the borough; and on that account, bishop Flambard strengthened that side of the castle, between the bridge and the north gate before spoken of, with a moat; which, from the example before given, was undoubtedly for∣tified with round towers or bastions. <Q>The method of attack and defence of fortified places practised by our ancestors before, and even some time after the invention of gunpowder, was much after the manner of the Romans; most of the same ma∣chines being made use of, though some of them under different names: They had their engines for throwing stones and darts of different weights and sizes: For ap∣proaching the walls they had moveable towers <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Grose's Antiq. vol. i. 2d ed. p. 14 and 17.</NOTE>.</Q> So that the more lofty the forti∣fication, consequently it was more difficult of assault by the machines used in sieges. "Of the vast force" of the engines, <Q>surprising stories are related; no wall, how∣ever thick, was able to resist their stroke; and in the field they swept away the deepest files of armed men; with them were thrown not only large milstones, but sometimes the carcases of dead horses, and even living men <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><Q>The former, according to Froissart, was practised by John duke of Normandy, son of king Philip de Valois, when he besieged the count of Hainhault, in Thyn-Levêque, in the Low Countries, and whom he thereby obliged to capitulate, on account of the infection caused in the town; and, as Camden says, it was also done by the Turks in Negroponte. The other, namely throwing a living man, is also mentioned by Froissart. It happened at the siege of Auberoche, in Gascoigne, where the English being closely pressed by the count de Laisle, lieutenant-general to Philip de Valois, they sent out an esquire with a letter, which he was to endeavour to deliver to the earl of Derby, their general, but being taken, his letter was read, and afterwards tied round his ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and he being put into an engine, was thrown back into the castle, where he fell dead among his companions. Moveable towers are repeatedly mentioned as much in use, parti∣cularly by the English. Froissart is very circumstantial in his account of one used at the siege of R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole, by the earl of Derby; who, having laid before that place nine weeks, caused two towers, three sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gh, to be built with large beams: Each tower was placed on four small wheels or trucks, and towards the town covered with boiled leather, to guard it from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, and to resist the darts: On every story were placed 100 archers. These towers were pushed by the force of men to the city wall, the ditch having been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>led up whilst they were building: From these the soldiers placed in the different stages made such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us discharges, that none of the garison, except such as were well armed, or covered with large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to shew themselves on the rampart.</Q>—<BIBL>Grose, vol. i. p. 18, 2d edit.</BIBL></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Many of the keeps or dungeons, in the ancient castles, are placed in the same situation of the ballium, as the castle of Durham, as Connisborough castle, Tick∣hill, Portchester, Cambridge, Oxford, Tunbridge, and several others. The mount on which Durham tower stands is near forty-four perpendicular feet in height, from the level of the Place-Green, to the foot of the building, and it appears to
<PB N="285" REF="299"/>
have been forced from the level; to the above eminence add the natural height of the whole hill from the level of the river, and it will be upwards of one hundred and thirty perpendicular feet. It is the opinion of a skilful architect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Geo. Nicholson, who is director of the repairs now making at the cathedral.</NOTE>, that the foundation of this tower goes down to the rock; and by the falling in of some arches, we discover that the whole erection is vaulted underneath; but as those vaults, from their apparent depth, do not occupy above a fourth part of the height of the mount, we are left to conjecture in what manner the rest of the eminence was forced or supported: It is apprehended, that after the Norman tower was built, the mount did not remain cut out into terraces agreeable to the present form, but that the sides were regularly sloped from the building to the plain, to render it as difficult to be climbed as possible, forming a regular glacis or talus round the tower; and that the approach to the gate of the tower was by a long slight of steps, from the inner court, so narrow that two persons only could pass at a time; and so open on each side that an assailant opposed might be tumbled headlong to the bottom. Mr King, describing Coningsborough castle in the 6th volume of the Archaeologia, says, <Q>The first thing that strikes the eye is a very remarkable sloping part of the foundation walls, rising to a great height like a mount, and having in many parts, in consequence of its being covered with earth and moss, the appearance of a small hill exactly of the same dimensions as the castle itself; the bottom of this sloping part appears almost circular, but higher up are seen more fully, six vast projecting buttresses, ascending in a still more steep direction, to prop and sup∣port the building. Immediately above this sloping part the tower rises perpendi∣cularly to a great height: Its inside forms a compleat circle; but on the outside appear six additional square turrets, which are, however, merely the continuation upwards of the buttresses just mentioned.</Q> Before the present terraces of our tower were formed, perhaps the ribs of the foundation appeared supporting the but∣tresses of each angle; and by such a base, mining, which was much practised in an∣tiquity, would be impeded or rendered impracticable: The tower of Coningsborough castle forms an hexagon; Durham tower an ill-formed octagon of irregular sides; some of the fronts exceeding others in breadth several feet; the angles are support∣ed by buttresses, and a parapet has run round the summit of the whole building, with a breast wall and embrazure: The diameter of this tower in the widest part is sixty-three feet six inches, and in the narrowest sixty-one feet: It has contained four stories or tiers of apartments, exclusive of the vaults: The great entrance is on the west side: There is nothing now left of this edifice but the mount, vaults, and outside shell; which latter, from its noble appearance, and the great ornament
<PB N="286" REF="300"/>
it is to the city, has been an object of attention of many of the prelates.— Chambrè tells us bishop Hatfield built a tower to the castle; <HI>In castello Dunelm. aedificiae quae antiquitate &amp; vetustate consumpta et debilitata fuerant, renovavit; &amp; autam episcopalem &amp; aulam constabulari cum aliis aedificiis in eodem de novo construxit. Urbem Dun. licet hanc natura &amp; muri satis munierunt, turre tamen fortiori sumptibus suis in castello constructa, ipse reddidit fortiorem.</HI> Indeed from the whole mode of architecture, the roses which ornament the summits of the buttresses, and the form of the windows, we are led to conceive that the present shell was the work of bishop Hatfield, and repaired and kept standing by his successors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>On the east side of the tower, under the arms of lord Crew.</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>C DIU RUTTURI CASTELLI LATERA CU'.

The tower was only lined round the outward wall with apartments, so as to leave an inner area or wall from top to bot∣tom, by which the engines of war, and necessaries in time of danger and attack, were drawn up and distributed to the several parts of the building: Those apart∣ments have been approached by five different staircases or turnpikes in the angles, the remains of which are yet visible, so that the parapet could be mounted, the gal∣leries lined with armed men, and the apartments guarded in a very short time, and equally as quick the garrison could descend, and be ready for a sally. At present the mount, as we observed before, is formed into terraces, as well for ornament as recreation: The uppermost terrace is ten feet wide, and laid with gravel, command∣ing a prospect not only of the whole city and its beautiful environs, but also an ex∣tensive view of the country as far as Gateshead-fell, Penshaw, Newbottle, Warden Law, and Quarrington, with the nearer objects, Newton-hall, Pittington, Sherburn, Aykley-heads, and other places of note: Between this and the lower terrace is a grass slope, supported by a breast wall, and you descend by twenty-three steps; the second terrace is of equal breadth with the other, and laid with gravel, and is in like manner separated from the lowest terrace by a grass slope and breast wall, to which you descend by twenty-one steps; this terrace is of like width and form as the others, and is twenty-two steps above the level of the garden below.</P>
<P>Bishop Pudsey, who acceded to the bishopric in 1153, restored some part of the castle, which had suffered by fire. To this prelate we are induced to attribute the building of the first hall to the palace; but with other parts of the castle going to decay, the present hall, with the constable's-hall, were afterwards erected by bishop Hatfield: This prelate's works were magnificent; an improved taste prevailed in his time, and much ornament was introduced in buildings of this kind: The hall erected by him, we are told, was near one hundred and twenty yards in length, of a proportionable height and width, and lighted on every side; the roof of wood was ornamented in every rafter, and other decorations were given to this spacious room. It is described as having two princely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eats, one at each end: There were pulpits or galleries on each side, wherein the trumpeters or wind music used to stand to play

while meat was ushered in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide vol. i. p. 375, also note.</NOTE>. On the day bishop Bury was enthroned, A. D. 1333, he entertained in the hall the king and queen of England, the queen dowager of England, the king of Scotland, the two Metropolitans, and five other bishops, seven earls, with their ladies, all the nobility north of Trent, with a vast concourse of knights, esquires, and other people of distinction, among whom were many abbots, priors, and other religious<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Johannes 'othe Orcheyerd held in cap. two mess. in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ramw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ate, by the service of three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of court, and 2d. rent at the borough of Durham: And also a garden by the service <Q>Inveniendi olera po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> &amp; al. herbas p' potagio &amp; c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quina'.

Bishop Fox found it too expensive to keep this spacious hall in repair, or it was too large for his necessary purposes, and therefore he reduced it considerably; he took away the seat at the south end, and converted that part into a kitchen and steward's apartments, so that it was lessened at least one-third of its original size; yet there remained room enough for the entertain∣ment of the princess Margaret, and her attendants, in her way to Scotland; on that occasion, we read, that all the nobility and people of distinction of the northern parts, as well spirituals as temporals, were present, and the services consisted of that gorgeous display of provisions, called by the writers of that time <HI>double dinners.</HI> This prelate began to repair the great tower, and built a hall, kitchen, and some other apartments therein, but before his plan was far advanced, he was translated, and no further progress was made in that work: We see his arms in the partition wall of the great hall. Bishop Tunstall made great repairs to the castle, he built the present gateway and tower, and flanked it with a strong wall on either hand: He brought water to the palace in pipes, it being supplied before by wells and reser∣voirs; he erected the present gallery, and made a new approach to the apartments there; he also built a beautiful little chapel, which has received improvements from succeeding prelates, as the arms of Cosin and Talbot placed therein denote. We should not omit to remark in this place, that on the facing of the entrance into the stalls, at the west end, is a striking mark of Wolsey's arrogance; on the oak are carved the cardinal's arms, taking the dexter side against the arms of his principality and See of Durham. Bishop Barnes and Neile made great repairs: The latter en∣larged the windows, and thereby gave the apartments a new degree of elegance.</P>
<P>The great tower became an object of incumbrance soon after the Reformation; and at length, in bishop Morton's time, it was one of those erections for which the bishops were decreed to be discharged from future dilapidations, so that nothing but the love of ornament, and the solemn grace it added to the aspect of the castle in particular, and to this beautiful city in general, has since that period for a cen∣tury and a half saved it from utter demolition and ruin.</P>
<P>Bishop Morton had the honour of a royal visit at his castle of Durham, and then displayed the ancient hospitality and magnificence of the prelates of this See; he entertained king Charles I. and all his retinue in the hall of this palace, when he
<PB N="288" REF="302"/>
made his tour into Scotland, expending, as it is said, no less a sum than fifteen hundred pounds a day on the occasion. Bishop Cosin, whose memory is dear to those that venerate the ancient seats of our prelates, put the castle of Durham into repair, made a new entrance into the hall, renewed the fountain, added many apart∣ments, and gave much ornament to the exterior parts; he again reduced the hall, by taking off an audience room at the north end, at the foot of the great staircase; and put a screen of wainscot at the south end, to conceal the passages to the kitchen and offices; he also wainscotted the hall round about. In its present state the hall is one hundred and eighty feet in length, thirty-six feet in width, and about fifty feet in height to the rafters; is lighted by three large windows to the west, and two to the east. Since bishop Cosin's time, succeeding prelates have made improve∣ments, which, as well as the work of more remote ages, are distinguished by the arms placed on various parts of the building. Bishop Trevor did a great deal, particularly to the north front, which opens upon a terrace eighty paces long above the moat, terminated by the round tower before spoken of: He improved many of the apartments by putting in chimney-pieces of stone-work, highly wrought in the Gothic stile, and well adapted to the figure of the rooms, making very large sash windows in the same order, and stuccoing the walls and ceilings, in which work he employed the ablest masters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We have not been able to collect from the records before us what number or complement of men form∣ed the military establishment of this castle. The Inquisitions Post Mortem, which specify the ward service in the bailies, might be brought into one view; but the calculation to be drawn from thence would not be conclusive, as those provided but a small portion of the armed men liable to be brought to that duty; there∣fore it would prove a useless labour. Under the succession of bishops we have shewn who were governors of the castle; and the other officers whose names appear in the patents and appointments, are placed under every prelate; to repeat them in this place would be superfluous.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The Parish of St Nicholas, in Durham.</HEAD>
<P>From the Gaol-gates to the Market-place, you pass down Sadler-street, having Elvet-bridge on the right-hand. This street, or some considerable part of it, was anciently called the Fleshewer-raw, and is still occupied by butchers. We are led to lament that want of police in the city which should correct the brutal spectacle of slaughtering animals in the street; shocking to travellers, who instantly turn aside with disgust, and pass to other places, not only with prejudice of mind against the whole place, but with censures on its inhabitants: They look back on the magnificent buildings, and whilst they recollect the royal rights of the powerful prelate, the learned body of men who sit in the chapter-house, the re-infranchised body corporate of the city, and the opulent and polite inhabitants in general, they exclaim, <Q>In this seat of learning, the episcopal capital, and center of the provin∣cial law, hitherto common decency has not drawn a skreen before the execution of the slaughtering knife that serves their luxury.</Q></P>
<P>Elvet bridge was built by bishop Pudsey, who also restored the borough of Elvet, after the destruction made by Cumin's followers. <Q>As Framwel-gate bridge, built by bishop Flambard, was called the Old bridge, so Elvet bridge, built by Hugh Pusar, or Pudsey, was called the New bridge. There were on it formerly two chapels, one dedicated to St James, built by Lewinus Burgensis in the reign of king Henry III. and since converted to a prison for the house of correction: The other, dedicated to St Andrew <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapel was built upon two pillars nearer Elvet, and is at present a blacksmith's shop, but a charity school is kept in the chancel, the old walls still remaining. <BIBL>Randal's MSS.</BIBL></NOTE>, founded by William, son of Absolam, Ro∣bert de Insula, bishop, Edw.

<P><PB N="294" REF="308"/>The Market-place is a spacious square, well built; at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot of which stands the church of St Nicholas, occupying almost the whole of that side: Sadler-street enters the square at the south-east corner, Silver-street at the south-west, Claypeth∣gate is situate at the north-east corner, and a flight of steps leading by the New-place to the factory-house, on the north-west: These are the stairs by which the arch∣bishop of York escaped the fury of the mob, when he came to Durham to exercise his pretended jurisdiction during the vacancy of the See, after the demise of bishop Robert de Insula<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide vol. i. p. 228.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this square is a fluent fountain of excellent water, which supplies the greatest part of the town: The reservoir is built up in an elegant form, and ornamented with a fine statue of Neptune.

This grant was afterwards confirmed by the bishop, who granted liberty to break his soil for the aqueducts <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Some disputes lately arose, and it was questioned, whether the above privilege of a string pipe survived to <HI>the owner of the house,</HI> on which several learned counsel gave opinions clearly in his favour.—We believe this house now belongs to Sir Wm Appleby, knight.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There stood near the fountain a large market cross, which incumbered the square very much: It was lately taken down, and a handsome piazza built at the foot of the Market-place, to answer the same purposes <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>To the honour of Almightie God, ornament of the city of Duresme and commoditie of the people si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣quenting the market of Duresme, the market cross now there extant was framed with twelve stone pillars, and covered with lead, att the sole charges and expences of one Thomas Emerson, of the Blacke Fryers, in London, Esquier, in the yr of our Lord, 1617. <BIBL>Mann's MSS.</BIBL></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the west side of the square is the Town-hall, with commodious apartments for public festivals and other uses, lately rebuilt on a modern plan. The old hall was erected and given to the city by bishop Tunstal, ornamented with a large cupola in the center, and in other respects exhibiting the elegance which was introduced to these northern parts in that prelate's age: Whether before bishop Tunstal's time there was a <HI>Common-hall</HI> for the burgesses, is not well ascertained; but there
<PB N="295" REF="309"/>
was a <HI>Toll-booth</HI> in the middle of the square, as in other ancient places for the weights and measures: As Chambrè tells us, <Q>A beautiful marble cross which stood in the upper part of the street of Gilly-gate, in a place there called the Maid's-harbour, was given to William Wright, of Durham, merchant, at his petition, by Master Ormstrang Scot, lord of Keepyere, to be set up in Durham market-place. That on that occasion the figures of the twelve apostles, of curious workmanship in stone, were repaired and sumptuously gilt; three figures on each side of the cross in a square. At this time Thomas Spark, elected suf∣fragan bishop by bishop Tunstal, was bishop of Berwick, master of Holy Island, and custos and master of Gretham-hospital; at his charge the cross was erected in the Market-place where <HI>Old Toll-booth</HI> stood, in which work he expended eight pounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chambrè Hist.

<P>Adjoining the Town-hall is the house called the New-place, and in some records the Bull's-head: It was part of the possessions of Charles earl of Westmoreland, and tradition says was his palace; perhaps his crest was figured on the building, which occasioned it to be denoted by the Bull's-head, or Black-bull<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Ra. nup' Com.

<P>The church is very plain and meanly built, being constructed of small and perishable stones, so that from frequent pointing it is now almost covered with mortar. It varies greatly from the situation of other churches, evidently to suit the ground whereon it stands, which serves to support the opinion we before gave, that anciently, by a sluice, the city was here occasionally insulated, by bringing in the streams of the Were. The north wall is very strong and lofty, supported by square buttresses, or rather bastions. This church hath two side ailes, that to the north running the whole length of the building; the south aile is shortened by the tower standing on the south-west angle. The nave and two side ailes are twenty paces in width, and to the chancel the nave is twenty-six paces in length: The south aile is formed by one small octagonal column of considerable height, supporting blunt pointed arches: The north aile hath two short octagonal columns, with wide and lofty blunt pointed arches, rising from brackets at the extremities. The chancel opens with a pointed arch in the center, to the south a small column with a pointed arch, to the
<PB N="296" REF="310"/>
north a short round column, and irregular circular arches: The chancel is in length six paces to the steps, and the recess for the altar is six paces wide. At the opening of the chancel are the seats for the mercers company and body corporate, neatly fitted up. The roof of the north aile is supported by three half-arches, rising from octagonal brackets. The gates have circular arches: The south windows are modern and sashed; the north windows irregular, and some under pointed arches. This fabric hath been constructed at various times; the north aile bears marks of remote antiquity; but no records afford us further light therein, than that we find Galfrid de Elimer rector in 1133; though by the mode of architecture we should be led to give this church a cotemporary date with the first settlement of the Saxons at Durham.</P>

<HEAD>St Nicholas' church.</HEAD>
<P>There was a procession on Thursday after Trinity Sunday, in honour of Corpus-Christi day. The bailiff called together all the inhabitants within the town. Every occupation was to bring forth its banners, with the lights appertaining, and with them to repair to the abbey church door. On the west side of the way stood the banners, and on the east the torches pertaining to the banners.</P>
<P>In St Nicholas' church was a shrine, called Corpus-Christi shrine, appointed to be carried the same day in procession. This shrine was finely gilt, and on the top thereof was a square box of chrystal, wherein was in∣closed the holy sacrament. It was carried by four priests, the whole procession of all the other churches in the town going before it. St Cuthbert's banner, with two fine crosses, were brought out to meet it; and the prior and convent, with the choir in their best copes, met the said shrine, and fell on their knees and pray∣ed. It was set in the choir, and <HI>Te Deum</HI> solemnly sung; and all the banners followed the shrine into the church, going round St Cuthbert's feretory with their torches lighted.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHURCH OF ST GILES.</HEAD>
<P>The church of St Giles has marks of distant antiquity; it has no ailes, and much resembles the old church at Jarrow, being narrow, long, and very lofty: It is thirty paces in length, and only seven wide; the rafters of the roof are supported on brackets; it is lighted to the south by six irregular windows, and two to the north; the tower rises from a pointed arch. The arch which separated the chancel from the nave is broken down: The chancel is ten paces long, and of equal width with the rest of the church; has a modern window to the east, two windows under point∣ed arches to the south with pilasters, and one similar to the north. The font is a large uncouth cauldron. There is a recumbent effigy cut in wood, in the chancel; tradition says it belonged to the tomb of one of the Heaths, pourtrayed in a complete suit of armour, his sword sheathed, the hands elevated, and head rested on a hel∣met, with a bear's paw for the crest; at the feet these words <HI>Hodie Michi</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>St Giles's curacy not in charge.</P>

<P><PB N="304" REF="318"/>The traveller who is conducted to this church, should be admitted at the north door, and depart from the south door, where a noble prospect opens to the view, too extensive for a picture, and too rich for description. The inadequate ideas which language can convey, are to be lamented by the reader who has a taste for rural beauties, and the elegance of landscape. The church of St Giles stands upon very elevated ground, open to the south where the view is unobstructed. In front the meadow grounds form a steep descent to the river; on one wing closed by the wood called Pelaw Wood, on the other by the buildings of the street. At the foot of the hill the river Were forms a beautiful canal, almost a mile in length, termi∣nated by Elvet bridge to the right, and by the wooded inclosures of Old Durham on the left. On the opposite shore is the race ground, consisting of an extended tract of level meads, from whence, by a gradual ascent, rise the two Elvets; the street of Old Elvet running parallel, the other obliquely, bordered with gardens, and terminated by Elvet church; a handsome structure. The channel of the river lying between New Elvet and the Bailies, affords an agreeable break or change in the objects; the sloping gardens being seen over the buildings of Elvet, softened to the eye with that pleasing teint which the distance produces. On the brink of the ascent stand the Bailies, object rising gradually above object, guarded with the remains of the town wall, and crowned with the cathedral church, which in this view presents the north and east fronts, like the mitre which binds the temples of its pre∣late; giving the noblest supreme ornament to the capital of the principality. To the right Elvet bridge, with seven arches, receives the stream, and intercepts a fur∣ther view of the progress of the river: Over it, tier above tier, rise the buildings of Sadler-street, the gloomy and solemn towers of the gaol, and the battlement and octagonal tower of the castle; the trophies of civil jurisdiction wearing the aspect of old secular authority, and the frowns of feudal power. Between the chief objects, the cathedral and castle, on the nearer back ground, South-street, with its hanging gardens, makes a fine curvature; behind which Brandon Mount, with a spit of high land extending towards Auckland, form the horizon. Further to the right,
<PB N="305" REF="319"/>
from the banks of the river, rise the buildings of the Market-place, crouding the tower of the church, from whence the streets of Claypeth and Gillygate extend. Thus far description has proceeded without much faultering, but in the other di∣visions of the scene it is faint and totally inadequate: Whoever would know the rest must come and view it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the view placed as a head-piece to the first page of this volume.</NOTE>. Over the meadows, in the center, a precipice rises near one hundred perpendicular feet in height, called MAIDEN CASTLE, fear, or cliff; the steep sides of the hill to the right and left are covered with a forest of old oaks, and the foot of the cliff is washed by the river, whose stream appears again at this point. The lofty ridge of hills cloathed with oaks, stretching away, forms a ziz-zag figure; at the most distant point of which, the great southern road, up the new inclosed grounds of Elvet moor, is seen climbing the hill, for near a mile, be∣yond which very distant eminences form a blue-tinged horizon. To the left of Maiden castle cliff you look upon a rich valley, highly cultivated, extending nearly five miles in length and two in width, bending to the south-west, through which the river winds its silver stream, in the figure of an S: Hanging woods shut in each side of the nearer vale, where are finely disposed, the pleasant village of <HI>Shincliff,</HI> the bridge of three arches, the villa of William Rudd, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and <HI>Hough-hall house:</HI> The extreme part of the valley is closed by the woods of Shincliff, <HI>Butterby,</HI> and <HI>Croxdale,</HI> forming an elegant amphitheatre; over these rise distant hills, lined out with inclosures, giving the yellow and brown teint to the landscape over the richer coloured woods. The whole finished with an elevated horizon, on the wings of which are scattered the villages of <HI>Ferryhill</HI> and <HI>Merrington;</HI> the tower of Mer∣rington church forming a beautiful and lofty obelisk. One of the greatest excel∣lencies of this landscape is, that the ground rises gradually before you, and just such a distance is maintained as preserves all the objects distinct; not like the landscapes painted by the Flemish and Dutch masters. To the left you look down upon <HI>Old Durham house,</HI> its terraces and hanging gardens, with a fine bend of cul∣tivated country stretching away through another opening of the hills towards the east, bounded by the high grounds of Quarrington, and the cliffs of Coxhoe Lime∣kilns; more rustic than the other views, and being in a simpler nature, affords a pleasing variety to the eye of the man of taste, who stands (if we may be allowed the extravagant expression) <HI>on this enchanted ground</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr Doubleday's house, which is covered with lead, commands from the roof the whole of this prospect, with a wide, though much less beautiful, view to the northward.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Old Durham house</HI> is gone to decay, nothing now remaining but apartments for a farmer: It was anciently the seat of the Booths, afterwards of the Cockburns, lords of Ormston, and in more modern times became the estate of the Tempests, to which latter family it passed by intermarriage with the heiress of the Heaths. The gardens are formed into terraces of a considerable length. This sweet retirement is become a place of public resort, where concerts of music have frequently been performed in the summer evenings, and the company regaled with fruit, tea, &amp;c. The gardens are open all summer for rural recreation. The terraces command the elegant valley prospect before described.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="320"/>At the corner of the garden some few years ago were the remains of a very an∣cient building, with a circular window, and other appearances of the chapel form.

<P><Q>I have now by me a most moving and lamentable account, contained in about sixty letters, sent me by Mr J. Tempest, of Old Durham, formerly a member of your house, complaining of the most barbarous and ty∣rannic proceedings of the spiritual and temporal courts there against his person, estate, and property, that ever was known to have been practised in any court of law or justice whatever. And this, as he says, chiefly promoted and carried on by a confederacy between the bishop's chancellor and sheriff, who, by their under officers and agents, have illegally seized upon whatever of his property they can lay their hands on, on pretence of an outlawry or excommunication, of which he had no notice till the seizure was actually made: And that upon application to his sovereign, the bishop, for redress, he has been denied all manner of relief; and therefore intreats me to represent his case to you the parliament's committee, which I am now preparing to that end.

<P>The editor of Camden says, p. 946. <Q>On the same river is Old Durham, from the name of which one would conjecture, either that the monks had first come thither with St Cuthbert's body, or that there had been a town of that name before their coming.

It is conjectured, when the bishop erected <HI>a new free borough</HI> for merchants in Elvet, the distinctions of <HI>the borough of Elvet,</HI> and <HI>the old borough of Durham</HI> first arose. Was there not much evidence to shew, there were distinct places called the old and new borough, out of the bounds of the city, and in the limits of St Oswald's parish, we should not have insisted on the position so positively. When the <HI>old borough of Durham</HI> had its rise, from whence, or what were its privileges, we remain ignorant; but the evidence we shall produce leads us to judge <HI>the old borough of Durham</HI> comprehended the whole parish of St Oswald, substracted from Croxdale, and that on the institution of <HI>the borough of Elvet,</HI> limits and bounds were set to the new borough, and the rest remained to the old borough; admitting this conjecture, it will follow, that the old borough comprehended Crossgate, South-street, &amp;c. now St Margaret's cha∣pelry, and in fact circumscribed the new borough, It is not material to press this subject further than to support our first position, that Old Durham, and the old borough of Durham, were the first settlements of the Saxons here, before they built their church on the summit of the hill; and from thence those places derived their present name.</P>

Mr Pegge thus ingeniously explains, in treating of the maiden way or maiden castle, in the county of Westmerland, and which term is particularly applicable to the delightful situation of Old Durham. It also has a better claim to be considered as the Condurcum of the Romans, from which it is about two miles distant, than the camp near Sunderland bridge, (which is evidently of Danish construction) and which the annotator upon Camden says, was the opinion of a very great antiquary. I may likewise observe, with the learned Mr Whitaker and others, that the Romans had generally a summer and a winter station, situated within a few miles of each other, and often on opposite sides of the same river; which entirely coincides with the situation of Chester and this camp; the former might be the summer station, and this the winter. In Hollinshed's Chronicle, first edition, p. 225, we have an account of a memorable siege which this place sustained in favour of king Athelstan, against an army of Scots and Danes, commanded by Godfrey brother to Anlaf, and son to Sithric, the Danish king of the Northumbrians, about the year 930, under the title Duresme<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duresme appears to have been a name introduced by the Normans, on account of the fortress built here after the Con∣quest, to keep the natives in subjection.</NOTE>, though the foundations of the present city were not laid till sixty years afterwards; and Marianus mentions a synod being held at Dunelhoo, A<SUP>o</SUP> 822. This station, I imagine, was formerly thought of great consequence, but it at length suffered the rate of many others in the northern parts, when William the Conqueror made that horrid devastation between York and this place, and erected his castrum in the new city<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A melancholy instance of this depopulation, amongst many others, is to be met with at Acley, (or Acliff) in this coun∣ty, which may probably derive its name from Acca, bishop of Hagustald, in the beginning of the eighth century, and where Sir Henry Spelman mentions two Saxon councils having been held, annis 782 and 789. About a mile from the aforesaid village, after the grass is cut, the foundations of a considerable town, with a large church in form of a cross, are very con∣spicuous.</NOTE>; the fortifications were then partly level∣led, but enough is left to point out its former magnitude and importance; it being, in my opinion, much larger than Dr Stukeley <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">His description is as follows; Iter Boreale, p. 70. <Q>Eastward, over the river Were, upon another peninsula of high ground, I saw a camp, called Maiden Castle, which I judge to be Roman. It is almost incompassed too by a rivulet fall∣ing into the river from the east. It is of an oblong form, five hundred feet long, very steep on three sides; the neck is guarded by a rampart, and without that, at some little distance by a ditch. The prospect is large, more especially east∣ward.</Q></NOTE> has described; and the rivulet <HI>Pidding,</HI> has, with great labour and ingenuity, been diverted from its original channel, where it ran into the Were, near Shinkley bridge, to answer the purpose of the fosse along the southern and western sides of it. A gentleman, with whom I am acquaint∣ed, has carefully surveyed the old road from this place by Kepyer hospital, and he assures me, that in a dry season, the piers of a bridge are obvious in the bed of the river, seemingly of Roman construction; and I have authority to say, that coins have been formerly ploughed up here, and lately some of the lower em∣pire have also been discovered within its vicinage. The ground plot and ramparts of the watch tower, which served for signals to this station, are visible and almost entire at the entrance of Gillygate moor, and exactly correspond in form with those on the Roman wall in Northumberland. At Newton-hall likewise, on the opposite side of the river, there has been an exploratory castrum, seemingly for the security of Old Durham and Chester-le-Street.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="324"/>Maiden Castle he places at Old Durham, and supposes it a Roman camp: To illustrate his subject, the tract is attended in the Archaeologia with a plate; which represents the supposed face of a vallum, and shews in the back ground a round mount. This supposed vallum is at present so much levelled, that if ever it was forced, it now appears no otherwise than the swift slope of the bank on the side of the brook, and the mount is only a natural swell or rotundity of the back ground. The plot of ground chosen by this gentleman for the station or camp, on the north-west side nearest to old Durham, and where the brook doth not run, shews some deep trenches and high earth fences; but the whole is so irregular, that it is not possible to derive any distinct figure from the remains of the works. He quotes Hollinshed's Chronicle to support a conjecture, that about the year 930, this place sustained a siege. We beg leave to compare this authority with others re∣ferred to in the 3d page of this volume. We have not been fortunate enough in our reading, hitherto to dis∣cover any evidence that William the Conqueror, when he laid waste the country, destroyed this place, or <Q>that it suffered the fate of many others in the northern parts, and that the fortifications were then partly levelled.</Q>—Dr Stukeley's description may, perhaps more happily be applied to the place described by us, and delineated in our plate; it is certainly of "high ground" hanging "over the river." and almost full "east" of the city: "Of an oblong form" one hundred and seventy paces long on the most extended side, which comes almost accurately to his description, <Q>five hundred feet long, very steep on three sides, the neck guarded by a rampart, and without that, at some little distance, by a ditch.</Q> The last circumstance noted by that author fixes the point. "The prospect is large, more especially eastward." The elevation of Old Durham ground, pointed out by Mr Cade, <Q>no part is above fifteen feet from the plain, where any slope lies upon the margin of the brook; and the prospect consequently is bounded eastward, by the ter∣mination of the vale, at the rising grounds of Shincliff, not more than a quarter of a mile distant.</Q></P>
<P>Mr Cade's positions, in the treatise from whence the foregoing extract is made, may, it is hoped, without an invidious appearance be shortly commented on, to the intent the reader may form a competent idea of the circumstances, or be led to enquire for himself upon the spot.</P>
<PB N="308" REF="322"/></NOTE>, inaccessible from the river by reason of the steepness of
<PB N="309" REF="323"/>
the cliff, which is almost perpendicular, and about one hundred feet in height. —On the right and left the steep sides of the mount are covered with a thick forest of oaks: The crown of the mount consists of a level area or plain, forty paces wide on the summit of the scar, in the front or north east side, one hundred and sixty paces long on the left-hand side, and one hundred and seventy paces on the right. The approach is easy on the land side, from the south-west, fortified with a ditch and breast work: The entrance or passage over the ditch is not in the middle, but made to correspond with the natural rise of the outward ground; probably this entrance was guarded by a draw-bridge: The ditch is twelve paces wide, and runs with a little curvature to each edge of the slope, now covered with wood as before noted; on one hand being fifty paces in length, on the other eighty paces. After passing the ditch there is a level parade or platform,
<PB N="310" REF="324"/>
twenty paces wide, and then a high earth fence, now nine feet perpendicular, which, as in most places of the like kind, it is apprehended, was faced with mason-work: A breast work has run from the earth fence on each hand along the brink of the hill, to the edge of the cliff or scar. The earth fence closes the whole neck of land, and is in length one hundred paces, forming the south-west side of the area. These particulars are illustrated by the annexed plate. It is most probable this was the <HI>vetus burgus Dunelmensis</HI> noted in the records; it is at a little distance from the head of the street called Old Elvet, in a direct line therewith, and oppo∣site to Old Durham, the river dividing it from the latter place, and almost filling up the intervening space: It was supported anciently, as is presumed, by another fort∣ress called the <HI>Peel,</HI> erected on the opposite eminence, which now bears the name of Peel Law. Many places in the northern counties retain the name of Peel and Law, implying castle and hill, whose antiquity may be traced back to the Saxon times. We presumed to offer an opinion, in the preceding pages, that in the valley over∣looked by this fortress, the wandering Saxons sat down with the remains of Saint Cuthbert; and we submit to the candour of the reader, whether that idea is alto∣gether vague and improbable. The name of <HI>maiden</HI> applied to a castle is now be∣come indefinite; whether it imples <HI>beautiful,</HI> or a fortress which never has been conquered, has not been determined: Our best antiquaries give preference to the distinction <HI>fair</HI> or <HI>beautiful.</HI> The old fort, on Stainmore, in Westmoreland, is called <HI>Maiden Castle,</HI> and the adjoining inclosures bear the name of Peel-yard.</P>

<P>Having trespassed much on the reader's patience, we proceed with the parish of St Oswald. There are two streets, the one called Old Elvet, the other New Elvet; from New Elvet branches out a street, called Hallgarth-street; from the prior's hall, named in the records <HI>Elvet Hall,</HI> the manor and barony house standing therein <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">John de Herdwyck, d. s. &amp;c. a mess. in Elvet, Durham, held of the prior of Durham, by suit at the three head courts yearly, at the priors court at Elvet-hall, &amp;c.—Inq. p. m. q'o Skirlaw, ap.

At the end of this street is a lofty hill of a conical figure, called Mont'joye, rising from the plain or valley, (but on the opposite side of the river to Old Durham) where we have presumed the Saxons sat down with the remains of St Cuthbert. In French history we find a definition of this historical title, for there the name of Mont-joye is given to heaps of stones laid together by pilgrims, on which crosses are erected, when they come within view of the end of their journey; and so betwixt St Dennis, in France, and Paris, they are called St Dennis's mont-joyes. When the travellers, bearing St Cuthbert's remains, arrived here, they would view the whole ground of their destination; and it lies in the exact line in which we presume they made their pro∣gress from Ripon. The extremity of New Elvet bears the name of Church-street.</P>
<P>The church stands in a fine elevated situation, on the brink of the river. Much conjecture arises in etymologies; perhaps the situation gave the name to Elvet, de∣rived from the French <HI>elevè,</HI> lofty, sublime.

The church is well stalled, the chancel remarkably neat, and kept with that pious decency which is ne∣cessary to the solemnities of divine worship: It is 12 paces in length to the steps of the altar rails, and six wide: The altar is elevated six steps, and the space within the rails is upwards of 12 feet: The east window consists of four lights, under a pointed arch; there are three windows on the north side, and four on the south, some of which are modern: Behind the table, and on each side, it is wainscotted, painted, and gilded; and below the rails, the chancel is regularly stalled in the cathedral form with oak, having a large seat at each side of the entrance gate. The roof is flat and stuccoed. The vestry room is also very neat. There is much broken painted glass in the windows, but no figure perfect. Against the second pillar, chained to a desk, is "The defence of the apology of the church of England," with the sermon preached at Paul's cross, by the bishop of Sarum, 1560, and other curious tracts. In the tower is a set of six musical bells. The vicarage house is sweetly situated at the north entrance into the church-yard, on the banks of the river.</P>

<P>There was an hospital dedicated to St Leonard, in this parish; but who was the founder, what was the constitution, or the time of its building, remain unknown: It is not named in the Monasticon, or any other authorities before us, save those of the church of Durham. We are led to conjecture that this hospital stood at Beau∣trove or Butterby, as that manor is tithe-free, and situated near the medicinal springs hereafter noted.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the south wall of the church-yard, is a field, called the Anchorage, (or Anchoritage, Hermitage, or Hermit's close) and adjoining thereto is a field called the Palmer's (or Mendicant's) close; but we have met with no evidence re∣lative to a hermitage here.</P>
<P>From the south-west corner of the church-yard you enter upon those beautiful natural scenes which border the river. A walk is laid open, and kept in order for the recreation of the public, at the charge of the dean and chapter, whose bene∣volence on this and various other occasions, demands the warmest acknowledg∣ments. Mr Pennant, speaking of the banks, says, they <Q>are covered with wood, through which are cut numbers of walks, contrived with judgment, and happy in the most beautiful and solemn scenery. They impend over the water, and receive a most venerable improvement from the castle and ancient cathedral, which tower far above.</Q> The banks are steep, and cloathed with forest trees;
<PB N="317" REF="331"/>
in several parts the rocks break forth, where venerable oaks are suspended: The river, with a pure and tranquil stream, glides at the bottom of the hill, reflecting the noble objects which crown her banks: Here the opening valley pours forth a ri∣vulet, and there the solemn dell, with Nature's wildest beauties, yawns with broken rocks, which yield the living fountain from their lips, whilst each brow is crowded with bending oaks, whose naked talons and twisted arms rival each other in gro∣tesque figure. You see the towers of the cathedral rising sublimely from the wood, and lifting their solemn battlements to the clouds; and beyond those the turrets of the castle, on their rocky base; whilst on the other hand, the houses of South-street are stretched along the summits of hanging gardens: In front is an elegant new bridge of three arches, through the bows of which, at the first distance, are seen a fine canal of still water, with a mill; at the second distance, Framwelgate bridge, of two elliptic arches; and through the bows of the second bridge, the pleasant villa of <HI>Crook Hall</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Crokhogh.</P>

This prospect, perhaps, is not to be equalled in the environs of any city in the known world. On turning about, you have a view not less pleasing for its simplicity; you command the walk before noted, with a fine bend of the river, forming a crescent; the banks richly cloathed with wood, and crowned with the church of St Oswald. This walk is much fre∣quented, and deservedly has the applause of every traveller. We present to the reader two plates of those favourite views on the banks.</P>
<P>The New Bridge was erected in 1781, at the expence of the dean and chapter, by Mr Nicholson their architect: It is upon a beautiful modern plan, the arches semicircular, with a balustraded battlement. There was formerly a narrow bridge near this place for horses to pass, which was carried away by the floods in 1771 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>At this bridge there happened a remarkable accident: A Mr Dalston of the Cothamhall-garth family, forced his horse over the battlements, in the dark, and was killed; he was passing the bridge on return from a country visit with a large company, and though in the midst of them, was missed by none till they arrived at the house where he was to lodge.</P>
<P>An account was given of the stood in 1771, in the public prints. The waters were eight feet ten inches higher at Durham than ever known before.</P></NOTE>: The accident proved fortunate for the public, as it occasioned the present hand∣some structure <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the plate.</NOTE> to be erected, which being of a suitable width, the chapter permit gentlemen's carriages to pass thereon, without toll.</P>
<P>FRAMWELGATE BRIDGE, seen upon this view, has one pier and two elliptic arches, of ninety feet span, so flat as to be constructed on the quarter section of a circle, calculated to suit the low shores on each side: The masonry is plain, but ex∣cellent, as is proved by its age; it was built by bishop Flambard, has stood near seven hundred years, and is perhaps the finest model of bridge-building, of that antiquity, in Britain. A gateway tower which stood on the city end of the bridge, was removed of late years for the conveniency of carriages, which have encreased amazingly in number within this century.

<P>CROOK HALL, which we mentioned in the preceding page, took its name from a family of Crook who settled there in the times of king Edward II. and III. they having disused the name of Sidgate manor, its ancient title. In the time of Edward III. it became the possession of Billingham, of Billingham, who held it for many ages; and we find by the proceedings on an elegit, in 1651, this was the estate of Thomas Billingham, and therein it is mentioned as being the capital house of the manor of Sidgate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mickleton's MSS</NOTE>.

The situation is lofty and beautiful, com∣manding a fine prospect of the city and adjacent country: It is a handsome modern house, sheltered with plantations, and environed with rich meadow lands. Newton is named among those tenements, which, the monastic writers tell us, the bishops yielded up to the earls of Northumberland, to enable them by their issues, the bet∣ter to prosecute the wars of those times; which, when once severed from the church, were refused to be restored, and in time became lay fees: But afterwards, when the See was settled at Durham, the church was reinstated in all its ancient

<P>When the church and other edifices at Finchale were erected, the remains of which are yet standing, it is not possible to determine with precision, no evidence thereof being found in the archives of the dean and chapter: From the order of building seen in some parts of the ruins, much may be attributed to Henry the bishop's son; but other parts appear of older date. The solemn remains are
<PB N="322" REF="338"/>
situated in a very deep vale, on the banks of the river, where the stream making a sweep, forms a little level plot, which is almost covered with the buildings; shel∣tered to the north by the lofty rocks and hanging woods of Cocken, and on every other side by steep hills. The river flows swiftly over a rocky channel; and the murmuring of the waterfalls is re-echoed from the groves and cliffs. The present buildings are much disunited, so that it is impossible to trace all the ancient offices of this religious mansion.</P>
<P>At the entrance into the church, at the west end, on the right-hand, is a square vault, the roof of which is groined from the angles and the side walls, and support∣ed in the center by a short octagonal pillar: There was an aqueduct to this place, and it had an upper apartment. The church, though small, is in the form of a cross; the gateway, at the west end, has a pointed arch of several members, rising from small round columns or pilasters, with plain capitals: The nave is twenty-eight paces in length, and seven in width. In the center of the cross it appears there has been a tower or spire, supported on four circular pillars, very short and heavy, exceeding even part of Durham cathedral for disproportion: The pillars are so massive, that one of them contains a turpike staircase, which led to the super∣structure; they form a square of equal sides, twenty-one feet from pillar to pillar, the capitals of an octagonal form: The center had a dome or vaulted roof, with in∣tersecting ribs, and on the east side one pointed arch remains. In the etching given in Stevens' Monasticon, drawn by King, a short octagonal spire of stone is placed on the tower. On the north side of the nave, are four pillars supporting pointed arches; the pillars round, with capitals formed of double rolls, constructed of a durable stone, and entire; the south side is close, a long cloister or passage running on the outside to communicate with the south limb of the cross. The north and south limbs of the cross are exactly equal in length and width, being twelve paces long and seven broad: They are very ill lighted; one great window in the south limb, towards the east, being the chief: Indeed it appears that those parts have been added to the original structure, or rebuilt; as they are in no wise similar to the other parts in masonry or materials. The choir is remarkable; from the east window, ten paces in length, it is inclosed with high dark walls, and from thence to the cross, being nine paces, (the whole nineteen paces long) are two round columns on each side, similar to those in the nave, bearing three pointed arches: The east window has been sive paces wide, (as appears from the measure∣ment of the sole, for all the rest is gone) with outward buttresses, ornamented with stone pinnacles, one of which on the south side still remains. It is very singular that windows of a modern date have been placed between the pillars, to fill up the arches, formed of a yellow and perishable kind of stone; which work now separates itself from the arches: The yellow stone has been won from the bed of the river, and is of the same kind with those of which the out-buildings are constructed; the co∣lumns and arches are of a bluer nature, and in no wise injured by time; they seem to be of the Normandy stone, much like the columns and castings of several of the ancient castles. Allowing this observation to be just, we should be apt to conjec∣ture these columns and arches originally divided the center from a side aile; but
<PB N="323" REF="339"/>
on strict search, no foundations or other work was discovered which could encourage this idea: If there were no side ailes, then this was a fabric of singular construction; for it will follow, that the nave and part of the choir were open to the air on the sides, like a cloister: There is something similar in the abbey of Furness, in Lan∣cashire, where a part on the north side is open. The founder, in imitation of the severities of St Godric, might think it expedient to deprive the monks of indul∣gence, and leave the church open to the air; but in after ages, when the religious professed more outside shew than real zeal, yielded to the fascinations of luxury, and studied gratifications and softness, they closed the arches with windows, made covered passages, and transformed this building to its present model: As its solenm beauties are much admired, if the windows were displaced, and the co∣lumns and arches laid open, it would greatly improve its appearance, and render it still a finer objet from the walks of Cocken.</P>
<P>The rest of the monastic buildings are very ragged and ruinous: In one part a bow window is projected from a pilaster in the wall, and seems to have appertained to some chief apartment. The hall or refectory has been a handsome edifice; it stands on the south side of a court, nearly of equal sides, about twenty-six paces every way; is twelve paces long, and eight wide, within the walls; having five re∣gular windows to the south, and four to the north; in the staircase or entrance is a large window to the south: The vault underneath is supported by a row of four octagonal pillars in the center, without capitals, from whence the groins are sprung; the pilasters in the walls and angles are capitalled; the ribs are of hewn stone, meeting in points, and the interstices of the vault wedged with thin stones; the whole a fine piece of architecture. This vault is lighted by six small windows to the south, and is not above eight feet in height to the crowns of the arches.</P>
<P>It is said that St Godric, and also Henry de Puteaco, or Pudsey, lie interred here; but the floor of the church is covered with ruins, and grown over with brambles and weeds, so as to prevent, without much labour, a search for their tombs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Henricus de Puteaco, son to Hugh Puteacus, was founder of Finkeshal priorye, on Were, two mils be∣nethe Duresme, and there is he buried, and also S.

It is said Shincliff was the birth place of bishop Sever, abbot of St Mary's, York. We find the family of Aslakby had possession here in bishop Langley's time. It has been the seat of the family of the Hoppers of late years, whose present representative is <HI>Robert Hopper Williamson,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR></P>
<P>Near this village <HI>William Rudd,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> built his villa, seated in a delightful retire∣ment, commanding a solemn view of the sequestered vale, with its hanging woods, which form a beautiful amphitheatre; a scene excellently adapted to study and contemplation.</P>
<P>On the other side of the river stands <HI>Houghall,</HI> part of the prebendal lands of the church. The manor house was built by prior Hotoun, who, notwithstanding the embarrassments he suffered under the persecuting spirit of bishop Bek, com∣pleted this and other considerable pious works. No certain etymology of the name of this place is obtained; from its situation, in a low and watry plain, we may adopt the word <HI>hough,</HI> which in this country has acceptation for a plain by the side of the river; which is sufficiently descriptive of the scite of this place. There was in the cathedral church, as before noted, an altar called Howall's altar, erected
<PB N="325" REF="341"/>
perhaps by some benefactor who bestowed this place on the church; or indeed it might be called Hotoun's hall, from the prior who built it in the thirteenth century; the corruption to Houghhall seems a familiar one. The house has been moated round and otherwise fortified: Tradition says Sir Arthur Hazelrigge possessed it, and that Oliver lodged there for some time; it is certain it was refitted, and perhaps put into a state of defence by some of that party; the arms of Cromwell now remain on one of the mantle-pieces in the house.</P>

<P>anciently written <HI>Beautrove,</HI> from its beautiful situation. The river Were runs almost round the chief part of the estate, the neck of land which divides the streams being only about two hundred yards wide. Here, it has been imagined, stood the ancient hospital of St Leonard; the founder and institution not now known. The lands are remarkably fertile; the river near the house falls swiftly over a rough channel, under high rocky shores and hanging woods: On the more distant side of the estate the river flows deep and slow, forming a canal a mile in length, where the adjacent lands make a considerable plain. There is not a sweeter rural scene in the whole county, unadorned and in simple nature, for art has not yet extended her hand hither, further than in the ordinary course of agri∣culture. As this place is remarkable for its beauty, so it is for natural curiosities; surrounded with the river, from the fissure of a rock, which lies about forty feet from the shore, flows a considerable spring of salt water, mixed with a mineral quality. The situation of this spring subjects it to a mixture of fresh water, so that it is difficult to know how much salt it contains in its purest state; on several trials it has yielded double the quantity produced from sea water. The shore for a con∣siderable distance shews many ouzings, or small issues of salt water; from which cir∣cumstance, and by a dike or break of the rocks in the channel of the river, a little above the spring, it is presumed a rock or bed of salt might be won of some value: It has never been searched for; the family who lately possessed the estate, from a love of retirement and ease, neglected a trial. The spring is much resorted to in sum∣mer for its medical qualities; but as the well is not inclosed by any building, it is frequently overflowed by the river. This water is reputed to be an effectual reme∣dy for a disease known among people employed in smelting and refining houses be∣longing to the lead works. Half a pint is sufficiently purgative for the strongest person. Within a few yards of the salt spring, on the opposite shore, is a fluent spring strongly impregnated with sulphur, without any vitriolic or other compound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We find the following account of this spring in Gibson's edition of Camden, which is transcribed almost literally from Baker's Chronicle.</P>
<P>The Spadacrene is between Butterby and Durham on Elvet moor.</P>
<P>A little below Branspeth, the Were has many huge stones in its channel, never covered but when the river is overflowed by rains: Upon these if you pour water, and it mix a little with the stone, it becomes brackish, a thing which happens nowhere else. Nay, at Butterby, a little village, when the river is shallow, and sunk from these stones in the summer time, there bursts out of them a reddish salt water, which grows so white and hard by the heat of the sun (as hath been thought) that they who live thereabouts use it for salt. But that the saltness itself proceeds not from the heat of the sun, is plain by experience, in that which is most saltish, and issues out of a rock, in as much as if all the water be laved out of the place, there immediately bubbles out of the body of the rock a water as salt as the former; and besides, the rock out of which it issues is a salt rock of a sparkling substance. On the other side of the Were, there is also a medicinal spring of strong sulphur; and above it, towards Durham, is a mineral water, of the vitriolic kind, upon which Dr Wilson wrote his Spadacrene Dunelmensis.</P>
<P>In Lowthorp's Abridgment of the Philosophical Transactions, vol. ii. p. 333, the following account is in∣serted, given by Mr Hugh Todd.</P>
<P>About a mile and a half out of Durham, on the north east side near Butterby, was lately discovered a me∣dicinal spring, which is much frequented, and may be of great benefit to the country. It was found by workmen that dug in that place for coal. When they were twelve fathom and a half deep they discovered this treasure of natural physic. They then tried the rock about one hundred yards off, where they lost them∣selves much about the same depth, and instead of coal, discovered an excellent spring of clear water, which issues out of the hole their instruments made. These springs are in a deep gill or valley on the shore opposite to Butterby.</P>

<P>At Saltwater Haugh, near Butterby, about a mild and a half from Durham, in the middle of the river Were. rises a salt spring. It is good to be seen and tasted only in the summer time, when the water is discharged all on one side of the channel, for in winter when the river is high it loses its salt in the fresh streams, so that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e not perceivable. The water seems to bubble up equally in all parts of the channel for the space of fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds in length, and about ten in breadth. The filtest of all the springs issues out of the middle of a rock, the surface of which was manifestly saltish, and which in a hot day, as I was told, would be all covered over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a persect salt. I had all the water laved out of the place where it seemed to stagnate, and imme∣dia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out of the body of the rock there bubbled up water as salt as the former. It was as high as any brine can be and though but little in quantity, in comparison of the fresh river, yet of that force to give a brackish∣ness to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> one hundred yards below. Those that have boiled this brine say, that it affords a great quantity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> baysalt, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> so palatable, yet as useful as ordinary salt is. It tinges all the stones with a red co∣lour. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea is eight miles off where nearest.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="342"/>The prospect from an adjacent head-land, called Croxdale Scar, is deservedly admired by every visitant: It commands an extensive view of the valley towards the west, with the channel of the river for several miles through a country highly cultivated. Over a fine plain, at the distance of a mile, are seen Sunderland bridge of four arches, with Croxdale, the beautiful seat-house of William Salvin, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> on the left, and Burnigill on the right; the scene animated by passengers on the great southern turnpike road: Beyond the bridge the vale narrows and winds towards the south, diversified by woodlands, cottages, and inclosures: To the right you look down upon the vale of Butterby, belted round with the crystal waters of the Were, and the eye traces its varied shores, its rocks and sylvan scenes: Be∣yond which lies an extended valley, terminated by the village of Shincliff, and in∣closed on every side with lofty forests.</P>
<P>The manor-house of Butterby stands in a pleasant garden, which, with the whole offices are inclosed by a deep moat, walled round, and though now dry, is capable of being filled with water to the depth of 15 feet: The entrance is by a strong gate∣way and bridge. The secluded situa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the house shuts it from distant pros∣pects; but such as it commands are romantic and rural. In cleansing the moat some years ago, in a large stone trough were found a coat of mail, with a cap of chain work quilted in canvas, a halbert, breastplate and buckler: In an adjacent field, where it is supposed an ancient chapel stood, many stone coffins and holy water jars were dug up.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="343"/>This is a manor and constablery of itself, free of all manner of tithes, paying a prescript rent of 1l. 13s. 4d. to the curate of Croxdale, at Midsummer.</P>
<P>Butterby was part of the ancient possessions of the Lumleys, of Lumley castle: Sir Marmaduke Lomeley held it, and from him it descended to Robert his son, who died seised thereof in the 36th year of bishop Hatfield, 1381, as appears by an in∣quisition taken at Durham, before Will. del Bowes, escheator: Ralph de Lumley was his brother and heir, and was possessed thereof at the time of his attainder, 1st king Henry IV. 1329; after which, in great bounty, the crown in the following year granted to Eleanor his lady, daughter of John lord Nevil of Raby, and sister of Ralph earl of Westmoreland, 20l. a year out of the duties of Hull, together with the manors of Beautrove and Stranton: Thomas, her eldest son, died possessed of the castle of Lumley, and manors of Stanley, Stanton, Ricklesden, and Beautrove, in the 5th Henry IV. leaving his eldest son Sir John, who was restored in blood in the thirteenth year of that reign. As we do not find Beautrove in any future in∣quisitions taken on the deaths of the Lumley family, we may conclude it passed as a marriage portion with Margaret, one of the daughters of Ralph Lumley, who mar∣ried Sir John Clervaux of Croft, or otherwise sold into that family; for Elizabeth, the heiress of Clervaux, married Christopher Chaytor, and carried with her large pos∣sessions: And we find, in the 8th year of queen Elizabeth, this Christ. Chaytor was possessed of Beautrove, and suffered a recovery <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Record of Homage 7 bishop Barnes.—Cursitors Rolls.—<BIBL>Rudd's MSS.</BIBL></NOTE> thereof <HI>in Cur.

Nicholas Chaytor, of Croft, in the county of York, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> by his will, dated February 8, 1665, made several provisions out of this manor for his younger children, and subject thereto the estate descended to his eldest son Sir William Chaytor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="331" REF="347"/>A small rivulet runs at the foot of the pleasure grounds, called Croxdale beck; this water passes through a very romantic channel, and supplies a paper-mill: It makes its way in a deep and narrow dell, just sufficient to admit a winding road to the mill. The rocks on each hand are shaken and columnar, affording several grand and awful scenes; the precipices overhang the vale; and large forest trees, bend∣ing from the cliffs, extend their solemn shade on every side. The natural grottos watered with cascades, the mossy banks, the falling streams of the brook, the gloom of the thick foliage, the grotesque rocks, the spreading arms of the oaks, the grassy plots that border the rivulets, all conspire to please the mind that has a taste for solitude, romantic scenes, and rural meditation. Was a little art employed to smooth the paths, to remove some few deformities, and with a skilful hand to dress the wild beauties of the vale, we know not where a more extraordinary scene could be found. The dell is so deep, that on very few days in the year the sun's rays touch the mill-house, and a person might live there for an age and never enjoy that spectacle. In days of deep ignorance and superstition, this dell was thought to be the residence of evil spirits; an idea which gained credit, perhaps, from its being a place resorted to by robbers and vagabonds. To banish the infernal inhabitants, a cross was erected here, which gave name to the adjacent lands, this being in se∣veral old writings wrote <HI>Croixdale;</HI> so the desert of Cross-fell, in Cumberland, is in old authors and charts called <HI>Fiends Fell;</HI> and since the erection of a cross there∣on, to vanquish the legions of Satan, it has obtained the present name of Cross-Fell.</P>

<P>ALDERNAGE HOUSE, otherwise called Aldin-Grainge, in a pleasant retired situ∣ation on the banks of the Brune, was the place of residence of John Bedford, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> M. D. in the last years of his life; with a considerable estate adjoining, held un∣der the dean and chapter of Durham, by lease for twenty-one years <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>Extract from Nichol's Anecdotes of Wm Bowyer, Printer, F. S. A. 1782.—"The name of Bedford has occured so often in this volume, that it becomes necessary to give some account of the family. Hilkiah Bedford, of Sibsey, in Lincolnshire, a Quaker, came to London, and settled there as a stationer, between the years 1600 and 1625. He married a daughter of Mr Wm Platt, of Highgate, by whom he had a son, Hil∣kiah, a mathematical instrument maker, in Hosier-lane, near West-Smithfield. In this house (which was afterwards burnt in the great fire of London, 1666) was born the famous Hilkiah, July 23, 1663; who, in 1667, was admitted of St John's college, Cambridge, the first scholar on the foundation of his maternal grandfather, William Platt. Hilkiah was afterwards elected fellow of his college, and patronised by Hen∣cage Finch, earl of Winchelsea, but deprived of his preferment (which was in Lincolnshire) for refusing to take the oaths at the Revolution, and afterwards kept a boarding-house for the Westminster scholars. In 1714, being tried in the court of King's Bench, he was fined 1000 marks, and imprisoned three years, for writing, printing, and publishing "The Hereditary Right of the Crown of England asserted, 1713," folio; the real author of which was George Harbin, a nonjuring clergyman, whom his friendship thus screened, and on account of his sufferings he received 100l. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Perhaps the pocketing of the hundred pounds required no ceremony; for Bedford "was prosecuted, and suffered imprisonment for fathering" the book; which notorious fact, known to lord Weymouth and all the world, might sufficiently account for the benefaction to Bedford, whether he was looked upon to be the author of the book or not. But the strange part of the story is, that Harbin, the author of the book, should carry the money to him as the real author.</P></NOTE> from the earl of Weymouth, who knew not the real author. His other publications were, a translation of an answer to Fontenelle's History of Oracles, and a Latin life of Dr Barwick, which he afterwards translated into English. He died in 1724. By his wife Alice, daughter of William Cooper, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> he had three sons; 1. William <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I have a number of this gentleman's letters to Dr Z.

He was thrice married; died in 1776, very rich; and left a son, Hilkiah, who was entered in the summer of 1768, of St John's College, Cambridge, became a fellow of that college, and a counsellor, and died greatly beloved in 1779. Dr John Bedford had also two daughters: Elizabeth died single in August 1765: The other, Alice, (born in 1748) was married in 1766, to — Hall, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Durham, and is now a widow.</P></NOTE>, a physician at Durham.

Originally part of the possessions of the bishop, it was obtained in exchange by prior Ber∣tram, for Moorhouse; who, having a desire for a rural retreat for himself and successors, in this place erected a camera or lodge, with a chapel. Prior Hugh, of Darlington, who succeeded him at the distance of about fourscore years, in bishop Stichill's time, enclosed the park; it is also said by the monkish writers, he built a camera here, which we may conceive implies he added to or improved prior Bertram's erections. Whilst bishop Bek persecuted the convent, he broke down the fences of the park, and drove out the game. In the reign of king Edward II. the Scotch, among other depredations committed in the environs of the city, pil∣laged and defaced this beautiful retreat. Prior Fossour <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See page 89.</NOTE> had great pleasure in this

place; to him we may attribute part of the embellishments, for the architecture of the chapel points out the improvements of a refined age; and as he acceded to his office in 1342, it may be presumed he restored Beaurepaire after the destroying hand of the Scots, in 1346, when David Bruce, as Camden says, <HI>ferro &amp; flamma foevisset.</HI> As authors are silent touching Beaurepaire from this period, it is probable nothing material happened to it till the dissolution. The manor, with the house and park, were part of the possessions of the monastery, restored by the king's en∣dowment, after the institution of the dean and chapter.</P>
<P>In the time of dean Granville, who was instituted in 1684, an inquisition was taken of the deanry possessions, in which we find Beaurepaire thus described: "<HI>Proe∣ter domos sive aedificia apud Dun. fuit &amp; est spectan. ad decan. decanat.

And at Bearpark aforesaid, there formerly have been belonging to the said manor house, several courts and gardens that were walled about; and also sundry out-houses, which are now wholly dilapi∣dated, and nothing to be seen or perceived but the ruins thereof. <HI>Et etiam sedes, locus, sive villa de Bearparke, est &amp; ab antiquo fuit maneriu. ac domus mansional. terraeq. dominical. ejusd. manerij &amp; aedificiae &amp; structurae reliquae reliqua praementionat. ad cand. dom. mansional. spectan. necnon tenementa &amp; parcu. ejusd. manerij, aliaq. pro∣ficua &amp; emolumenta infra precinctus &amp; territoria dict. manerij annuatim emergen. no'ric sunt pars &amp; parcella corporis decanat.

Much destruction has been made in the buildings since dean Granville's time; and nothing but naked and distracted walls remain of this once beautiful place. The chapel is thirteen paces long and eight wide; the east win∣dow consists of three lights, circular at the top and very plain; there are three win∣dows on each side, each divided by a mullion into two lights, their framing on the outside square: The wall is strengthened with a buttress of neat hewn stone work between each window, and a cornice runs round the building of the zig-zag figure: There is a door on the north side of the chapel from the court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We meet with the names of three chapels:

The walls of the chapel in the inside are ornamented with a regular succession of small round columns or pilasters, belted in the midst, the capitals filled with a garland of open cut foliage, of a delicate work; from whence spring pointed arches, three pilasters and two arches in each space between the windows: The west end is equally finish∣ed with pilasters and arches; and there is a small window in the center: At each side of the east window is a pedestal, for a statue, of considerable size. The apart∣ment under the chapel is lighted by small square windows; but as the floor of the chapel is gone, it is not easy to determine how it was constructed. Adjoining to the chapel on the west is a long building, the two gabels of which are standing, having a large window of six lights to the south: This was most probably the re∣fectory. On the north are the remains of a building, twenty paces in length, light∣ed to the east by three windows, which we conjecture was the dormitory: The other remains are so ruined and confused, as to render them totally indistinct. There is a door case standing, which has been the entrance into the garden or some chief court, with the arms of the See in the center.

The king of England, with an army greatly inferior to his foes, by the valour and intrepid conduct of his heroic son, obtained a glorious victory at Cressy. He then formed a blockade before Calais, which, with other distresses, induced the king of France to send proposals to the court of Scotland, for making an invasion on the borders: The absence of Edward, the vast supplies of men and money which his campaign required, the exhausted state of England, afforded a probable appearance that David's projected expedition might be attended with success: The king of France's object was not honour to the Scotch crown, but to amuse the king of England, or draw off some of his forces: A considerable sum of money and rein∣forcement of troops were sent into Scotland, and the king, with the assent of his parliament assembled at Perth, engaged in the expedition. Edward having enter∣tained doubts, that during his absence a storm would be gathering on the brow of his known adversary, dispatched messengers to the court of Scotland, to amuse by offers of a restitution of Berwick, on condition that the Scotch would stand neuter in the conflicts between England and France; but contrary to the opinion of many of his most skilful peers, David rejected the proposed terms of amity, and prepared to invade England: He collected a powerful army, consisting, according to Rapin, of 30,000 men; other authors, particularly Froissart, Speed, Barnes, and Knighton greatly exaggerate the numbers; with these, in the beginning of October, 1346, David entered England by the western march, shewing tokens of a bloody and sa∣vage mind in his outset, by putting the garrison of Liddell tower to the sword, and marking his progress through Cumberland with wanton slaughter and desolation. He advanced to the county of Durham, and approached the city. The queen of England summoned the prelates and military tenants to attend her at York, where measures were concerted for opposing the invaders, and a body of troops, amount∣ing to about 16,000 men, were assembled with all speed; whilst David, with his army, lay at Beaurepaire, the associate lords encamped in Auckland park. Douglas, with a chosen troop, reconnoitering the English, was engaged near Merrington; his detachment was put to the rout, and he escaped to the king with much peril. Rapin tells us, the queen of England led the English forces to battle; but that as∣sertion is not supported by any cotemporary writer of credit: David looked upon his adversaries as a raw and undisciplined army, not able to stand against his hardy veterans, and shewed signs of great impatience before the troops engaged, pre∣suming that victory was certain, and that the riches of the city were due to his plundering soldiers: The English army was drawn up in four divisions; lord Henry Percy commanded the first, supported by the earl of Angus, the bishop of Durham, and several northern nobles; the second body was led by the archbishop of York, accompanied by the bishop of Carlisle, and the lords Nevill and Hastings; the bishop of Lincoln, the lord Mowbray, and Sir Thomas Rokesby led the third di∣vision; and at the head of the fourth was Edward Baliol, supported by the arch∣bishop of Canterbury, the lord Roos, and the sheriff of Northumberland: Each division consisted of four thousand men, and the archers and men at arms were distributed through the whole corps: The author of the Border History, probably from his own conjecture, for he quotes no authority, alledges <Q>That besides the
<PB N="340" REF="356"/>
forces above named, a strong and gallant party under the lords Deincourt and Ogle, guarded queen Philippa, who, in the morning before the battle, having rode along the ranks, and exhorted every man to do his duty, to maintain the honour of his king and country, and take revenge upon their barbarous inva∣ders, recommended her people to the protection of God, and retired to a small distance from the place of action.</Q> The Scotch army was drawn out in three divisions; the first was led by the high steward of Scotland, and the earl of March; the earl of Murray and lord Douglas commanded the second; and the third, con∣sisting of choice troops, in which were incorporated the flower of the Scottish no∣bility and gentry, sustained by the French auxiliaries, was commanded by the king in person. With much heroic ardour the Scotch king ordered the trumpets to sound the charge: The high steward, who led the van, being sore galled by the English archers, rushed on with such impetuous fury, that he threw them into con∣fusion, and drove them back on lord Henry Percy's division; and the Scotch push∣ing on vigorously with their broad swords and battle axes, broke them so much, that if relief had not instantly been sent them, they would have been put to the rout; but Baliol, rushing in with a body of horse, threw the Scotch battalion into confusion, and gave the English time to rally and regain their ground, whilst the high steward was obliged to retreat and reform his distracted array: In this ma∣noeuvre he is said to have shewn great generalship, performing the evolutions in a masterly manner, and with little loss. Baliol, with equal skill, gave his troops breath, made no pursuit, and when least suspected, rapidly charged the king's di∣vision in flank, whilst they fought man to man in front: Unrelieved, and distressed with this complicated battle, the king fought desperately, repeatedly bringing back his flying troops to the charge, encouraging them by his example, his exhortations and prayers: Ashamed to desert their prince in such jeopardy, a brave phalanx threw themselves around him, and fought till their numbers were reduced to little more than eighty: In this desperate state, and bleeding with many wounds, David scorned to ask for quarter, hoping he should still be relieved, At length resistance was vain, a tumultuous multitude, with shouts of victory, rushed upon him; and he at length was made prisoner to John Copeland, a Northumbrian esquire. The division under Douglas and Murray, struck with a panic at the fate of the royal legion, and overpowered with numbers, were soon broken and routed: Murray died on the field, and Douglas was made prisoner, and few of the inferior officers escaped the sword. <Q>The Scotch king, though he had two spears hanging in his body, his leg desperately wounded, and being disarmed, his sword having been beat out of his hand, disdained captivity, and provoked the English by opprobious language to kill him: When John Copeland, who was governor of Roxborough castle, advised him to yield, he struck him on the face with his gauntlet so fiercely, that he knocked out two of his teeth: Copeland conveyed him out of the field as his prisoner. Upon Copeland's refusing to deliver him up (his royal captive) to the queen, who stayed at Newcastle during the battle, the king sent for him to Calais, where he excused his refusal so handsomely, that the king sent him back a reward of 500l. a year in lands, where he himself should chuse it, near his own

dwelling, and made him a knight banneret<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Foed. tom. v. p. 542.—Froisart, l. 1. p. 140.—Rapin, p. 425.</NOTE>.</Q> This battle was fought on the 17th of October, 1346, and lasted only three hours, beginning at nine in the morn∣ing, the victory being declared by sound of trumpet at noon: The loss of the enemy was estimated at 15,000, the chief of whom were the earls of Murray and Strathern, the lord constable David Hay, the lord marshal Edward Keith, together with the lords chancellors and chamberlain of Scotland, the lords Philip Meldrum, John Stewart, and Alan Stewart his brother, sir Alexander Bothwell, the king's standard bearer, sir Alexander Ramsay, and others of high rank. Among the prisoners were the earls of Fife, Sutherland, Monteith, Carrick, and Wigton, the lord Douglas, the bishops of St Andrew and Aberdeen, James Douglas, sir Malcolm Fleming, with many men of distinction. Historians have not mentioned what particular loss was sustained on the part of the English. Knighton tells us of four knights and five esquires only, who fell in the field; and Dugdale says the lord Hastings was mortally wounded: But in so bloody a battle it is impossible but many men of distinction would fall in the English army.</P>
<P>The ground where this battle was fought is hilly, and in many parts very steep, towards the river, so that it is not possible to conceive how such an armament could be arranged and engage in any order. The account given of this battle, and of the subsequent transactions of the convent, by the writers of that house, as pub∣lished by Davies, and contained in Sir John Lawson's MSS. and Mr Hogg's Roll, is to the effect given in the notes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>In the night before the battle of Durham, there appeared to John Fossour, then prior of the abbey of Durham, a vision, commanding him to take the holy corporax cloth, wherewith St Cuthbert covered the chalice when he used to say mass, and to put the same upon a spear point, and next morning to repair to a place on the west of the city of Durham, called the Red Hills, and there to remain till the end of the battle.— The prior and monks, accompanied with Ralph lord Nevil, and John Nevil his son, lord Percy, and many other nobles, returned to the abbey church, there joining in prayer and thanksgiving to God, and holy St Cuthbert, for the conquest obtained that day: In which battle a holy cross, taken out of Holy Rood House, in Scotland, by king David Bruce, was taken from the said king; which cross is recorded, by ancient and credible writers, to have come to the said king most miraculously: Being hunting the hart in a forest near Edinburgh, upon Holy Rood day. In the place where this miracle was wrought, now springs a fountain, called the Rood well. The night after he was warned in his sleep to build an abbey in the same place.— Many excellent jewels and monuments brought from Scotland, and noblemen's banners, were offered to the shrine of St Cuthbert; together with the black rood of Scotland.</P>
<P>The banner cloth was a yard broad, and five quarters deep, the bottom was indented in five parts, and fringed, and made fast all about with red silk and gold. It was made of red velvet, on both sides em∣broidered with flowers of green silk and gold; and in the midst was the said corporax cloth inclosed, covered over with white velvet, half a yard square every way, having a cross of red velvet on both sides, be∣ing fringed about the edge and skirts with red silk and gold, and three fine little silver bells fastened to the skirts of the said banner cloth, like unto sacring bells.</P>
<P>On the west side of the city of Durham, where two roads pass each other, a most famous and ele∣gant cross of stone work was erected to the honour of God, for the victory there obtained, known by the name of Nevil's cross, and built at the sole cost of lord Ralph Nevil; which cross had seven steps about it, every way squared, to the socket wherein the stalk of the cross stood, which socket was fastened to a large square stone, the sole or bottom stone being of a great thickness, viz. a yard and a half every way: This stone was the eighth step. The stalk of the cross was in length three yards and a half up to the boss, having eight sides all of one piece; from the socket it was fixed into the boss above, into which boss the stalk was deeply soldered with lead. In the midst of the stalk, in every second square, was the Nevil's cross: A saltire, in a 'scutcheon, being lord Nevil's arms, finely cut; and at every corner of the socket was a picture of one of the four evangelists, finely set forth and carved. The boss at the top of the stalk was an octangular stone, finely cut and bordered, and most curiously wrought; and in every square of the nether side thereof was Nevil's cross, in one square, and the bull's head in the next, so in the same reciprocal or∣der about the boss. On the top of the boss was a stalk of stone, (being a cross a little higher than the rest) whereon was cut, on both sides of the stalk of the said cross, the picture of our Saviour Christ cru∣cified; the picture of the Blessed Virgin on one side, and of St John the Evangelist on the other, both standing on the top of the boss. All which pictures were most artificially wrought together, and finely carved out of one entire stone, some parts thereof through carved work, both on the east and west sides of the cross, with a cover of stone likewise over their heads, being all most finely and curiously wrought together out of the said hollow stone; which cover of stone was covered over. It remained till the year 1589, when the same was broken down and defaced by some lewd and wicked persons.</P></NOTE>.

The Parish of LANCHESTER</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Parish of</HI> LANCHESTER adjoins to Witton-Gilbert. It is very extensive, having now three chapels of ease belonging to it, Esh, Satley, and Medomsley. There are the remains of other cha∣pels; one at Old Hall, one at Rowley Gillet, one at Collierly, and another at Esp Green; but no evidence of their date or rights has come to our know∣ledge. This parish, to the north-west, adjoins upon Muggleswick, near Horslip∣burn, and the parish of Wolsingham; to the southward, on Brancepeth and St Oswald's, with Witton-Gilbert; eastward, on Chester; and, northward, on Tan∣field chapelry, and Whickham parish.</P>
<P>In the extracts from the Boldon Buke, given in the notes, the reader will find the servile tenures of lands in this parish. The villains were bound to mow the lord's meadow, and win and lead his hay; when they mow'd, they were to have from the lord their mess called a <HI>Corrody</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>Crowdy</HI> is a name in general acceptation in the north for a mess of oatmeal mixed with wa∣ter, which is the diet of the Scotch shepherds, and much in use among the common people of the northern counties of England.</NOTE>; they were to drive the lord's hogs from the forest after the mast and pannage season, on which latter duty each re∣ceived a loaf of bread. Some held their lands by more honourable services, as attending the lord in his forest-hunt in Weredale, called in all the records <HI>Magna Caza,</HI> or the Great Chace, with one or more greyhounds, and going upon embassy; such was the tenure of the lands of Hulfus, Ulkillus, and Meldredus, in this pa∣rish.

<P><PB N="354" REF="370"/>The church is a fine building of hewn stone work, covered with lead; its reve∣nues were swallowed up at the suppression of religious houses, a scanty allowance and a laborious cure being left to the officiating minister. The south front of the church is disfigured by a deep porch of fifteen feet: There is an aile on each side of the nave, formed by two rows of three beautiful round pillars ex∣cellently proportioned, supporting pointed arches, carved with the zig-zag figure; the nave is about forty-five feet in length, and twenty in width, lighted on each side by four upper windows, of two lights each, square topt; the ailes exceed the length of the nave some few feet, and are not of equal widths, the south aile being about nineteen feet wide, and the north only fifteen, lighted by three regular windows similar in form to those above, and a window at the east end, having a pointed arch: In painted glass in this window is a coat of arms, impaling Tempest, and under an arch in the side wall of this aile is the recumbent effigy of an ecclesiastic with his hands elevated, clasping a chalice, well cut in black marble <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We are inclined to believe this is the tomb of Stephen Austell, one of the deans, who died 27 Feb. 1461.

<P>Lanchester appears to have decreased greatly of late years, and now is a mere stragling village, placed in a warm and well-sheltered valley, with a fine stream of water, called Smallhop Burn, running through it. The scite of the old deanry-house enclosed with a moat remains, but no edifice: Several fertile inclosures skirt the town, and the improvement of land advances rapidly.</P>
<P>At the distance of a quarter of a mile, on an eminence towards the west, are the remains of the great Roman station, which Camden called <HI>Longovicus.</HI> Dr Gale, in the Philosophical Transactions, N<SUP>o</SUP> 357, calls it the <HI>Castra Stativa,</HI> where the soldiers were quartered in time of peace.</P>

<P><Q>Mr Horsley supposes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Horsley's Britan. Rom. p. 450, 451.</P>
<P>Mr Camden was of opinion that Lanchester was the Roman <HI>Longovicum,</HI> and by what Dr Hunter hath written to the Royal Society about it, we have reason to rest in that conjecture; for he says, that several in∣scriptions have been dug up there, and the Roman street called <HI>Watling street</HI> lies through it. It is seated on the top of a hill, and overlooked by another. By the ruins we may discern it has been a much larger place, in a square form, and fortified with a thick strong stone wall, about which now both within and without are nothing but ruins and rubbish. It is probable that the buildings within the walls were all public, viz. temples, palaces, and stations for the soldiers, and perhaps lodgings for the garrison. No doubt this colony was adorn∣ed with many beautiful buildings. The inscriptions found here since Mr Camden's time are as follows.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>They are all noted in the following extracts.</HI></P>
<P>When I was last there I looked at the pillars which had supported the floors of what is supposed to have been a balneum They were not all alike, nor of a very regular figure, but yet there was some similitude and proportion between them; they are all about two feet and five inches high, perhaps two Roman feet and a half. The angles or corners of four square stones rested on each of these pillars, and between each, two pil∣lars was more than a yard distance. Upon the square stones had been a plaistering about four inches thick,
<PB N="359" REF="375"/>consisting of lime and small pieces of brick. The marks of fire and smoke were very visible when they first discovered the place. I was also informed that there was another set of pillars underneath, which supported another such floor, and some sort of metal upon it, on which the upper set of pillars rested. The lower pillars stood upon a blue clay, and the intervals between them were filled up with earth and rubbish. It was con∣jectured that the first had failed or been destroyed, and that the second had been built on its ruins. Above this (according to the account I had, for there are no remains of it now) was a square room, having each side about four yards long, and the walls plaistered in the same manner, and with the same materials as the floor. The altar hereafter described was found at the east end of this room, with its back undressed towards the wall. I have been more particular in this description because it has not been sufficiently given before; but the other remains and monuments here I shall also largely describe.</P>
<P>There is a very considerable tumulus about a mile from Lanchester, called the <HI>Maiden Law,</HI> and probably the military way has not been far from this tumulus.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 2, plate. <HI>Imperator Caesar, Marcus, Antonius, Gordianus pius felix Augustus Balneum cum Basilica, a solo instruxit per Gneium Lucilianum legatum Augustalem Propraetorem curante Marco Aurelio Quirino praefecto Cobor∣tis primae Legionis Gordianae.</HI></P>
<P>This and the next are two curious and useful inscriptions, which, with most of the following, were made public in the Philosophical Transactions, N<SUP>o</SUP> 266, 354, from Dr Hunter, and have most of them been inserted in Camden. The originals are now in the library at Durham. Mr Gale thinks, that the <HI>Legio</HI> here called <HI>Gordiana,</HI> was the <HI>legio sexta victrix,</HI> which continued so long in the north, and had its stated quarters at York, whilst the other legions had their's at a much greater distance. Yet we have an inscription at this very place by the leg. xxvv. which was employed not far from hence in building or repairing some structure, as appears from the inscription at Whitley castle, in Northumberland. These inscriptions are valuable, as they have preserved to us the names of two propraetors, which otherwise must have been lost. For as Mr Gale ob∣serves, from <HI>Virius Lupus,</HI> who was propraetor under Severus in the year 208, to <HI>Nonnius Phillippus,</HI> (whom he believes to have succeeded the latter of these here mentioned) to the year 242, the name of no other pro∣praetor or legate is any where else to be met with. It is highly probable that the two here mentioned imme∣diately succeed one another, because both inscriptions were erected not only under the same emperor, but under the same commander of the cohort <HI>Aurelius Quirinus,</HI> who had the care of both these works. This, as Dr Hunter informs us, was found about one hundred yards cast of the fort, the other within the sort, which confirms Mr Gale's opinion, that the soldiers lodged within the sort. The <HI>Basaliacae</HI> of the ancients were public buildings, in which causes were heard, and merchants met for business; they were adorned with pillars and covered walks: Vitruvius has given a description of them, and so has Palladio from him. This stone is broke through the middle, and some of the letters are damaged or lost, but it is easy to supply them. And this inscription seems rather to be worse cut, and to be the later of the two. As for the <HI>pre</HI> for <HI>per</HI> and <HI>Gn.</HI> for <HI>Gneium</HI> in the fourth line, it would be easy to produce other parallel instances, as also of <HI>L</HI> for <HI>Legionis.</HI> But Mr Ward is inclined to think <Q>that <HI>pre</HI> at the beginning of the fourth line was not designed for <HI>per,</HI> and that the following word should not be read <HI>Gneium,</HI> but <HI>Egnatium,</HI> a name that frequently occurs in Gru∣ter. His reason for reading it thus is, that in all such mixtures of smaller letters against the middle of lar∣ger in the same word, the word always begins with a letter of the larger size; and as for the <HI>E</HI> he imagines it was not intended to serve both words by being read twice, because in such cases, which are very rare, the letter to be repeated is always found in a complex character. He supposes, therefore, that there has either been a small <HI>e</HI> between <HI>PR,</HI> which is now defaced, or that it was designed to be put there, but was forgot, as it easily might be.</Q>—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 11, p. 289.</BIBL></P>
<P>☞ The reader will refer to a learned treatise on this subject in the additions to Gordon's Iter. Sept. p. 12, too long to be inserted here.</P>

<P>So much has been said already concerning this inscription, under the former and another in Northumber∣land, that little more need be added here; it may not be amiss to observe, that the Emperor's name is here at length <HI>Antonius,</HI> as it is printed also in the <HI>Fasti Consulares.</HI> We have likewise some other instances of it in Montsaucon. Mr Gale says, that the <HI>armamentaria</HI> signify the arsenal, and <HI>principia</HI> the quarters either of the legionary soldiers, called the Principes, or the place where the ensigns are kept. But from a passage in Tacitus, one would rather conclude the latter to be the general's pavilion.—<BIBL>See Gordon's Itin. Add. p. 14, and Horsley, N<SUP>o</SUP> 12, p. 290.</BIBL></P>

It is much of the same sort with those which I have frequently observed to be erected by legions and cohorts in the face of some work they were building. The last letter has frequently been mistaken for a <HI>T,</HI> but in the original it is evidently an <HI>I,</HI> with the usual numeral stroke above it, and so can be nothing else but <HI>cohors prima.</HI>—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 13, p. 290.</BIBL></P>

<P><HI>Fortunae Augusti Sacrum Publius Aelius Atticus Praefectus votum solvit libens merito.</HI></P>
<P>I know not what cohort Publius Aelius Atticus commanded who erected this altar. The word <HI>Praefectus,</HI> without any thing following, is not uncommon in inscriptions. The person where I lodged at Lan∣chester told me that this altar was found at the east end of a square room, which they discovered within the station, and the back of the al∣tar is undressed. I know not whether or no the figure between the two leaves in the capital can be designed for the sun.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 14, p. 290.</BIBL></P>
<P>Mr Horsley's correspondent had furnished him with a very inaccu∣rate drawing; the cut was made from the original in the dean and chapter's library, in April 1776. The radiations Mr Horsley mentions are no other than the marks of the chissel round the cavity: The mouldings of this altar are as represented.—W. H.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 5, plate. <HI>Genio Praetori Claudius Epaphroditus Claudianus Tribunus Cohortis secundae Lingonum, votum libens posuit merito.</HI></P>
<P>This stone looks like a pedestal, and seems by its regular square cavity at the top to have had something fixed upon it, but it is nothing like the base of an altar. The letters are tolerably well cut. I at first was doubtful if the first line might have been <HI>Genio Praetoris,</HI> but upon examining the original, I saw every letter very plain, and was convinced that there neither was nor ever had been an <HI>S</HI> at the end. I then thought it might be a flattering compliment to the un-named praetor, as if he was their genius or tutelar god. But my learned friend Mr Ward, judges this too high a compliment to be paid by a tribune to a praetor, and ob∣serves that <HI>Genius</HI> is a proper name frequent in Gruter. It is therefore my present opinion, that this stone has sustained some pillar, or somewhat of that nature; and that the monument has been erected to the ho∣nour of <HI>Genius the praetor.</HI> If we read <HI>votum posuit,</HI> the word <HI>votum</HI> must by a trope be taken here for the thing vowed, as upon another inscription we have <HI>memoriam posuit</HI> for <HI>monumentum;</HI> and upon another <HI>vo∣tum fecit,</HI> which expression in the common sense is not to pay a vow, but to make it. And thus Virgil seems to have used the word <HI>votum,</HI> when he says
<Q><L>"Lustramurque Jovi, votisque incendimus aras."</L>
<BIBL><HI>AEN. 3. xi. 279.</HI></BIBL></Q>
And likewise Petronius, in the following passage,
<Q><L>— "Stipant graves</L>
<L>"Equi recessus Danai et in voto latent."</L>
<BIBL><HI>SATYR, cap. 49.</HI></BIBL></Q>
where the same thing is twice repeated in different words, and both <HI>equi</HI> and <HI>voto</HI> denote the wooden horse, which the Greeks pretended to consecrate to Pallas; <HI>votum pro redditu simulant.</HI> This compliment is paid by Claudius Epaphroditus Claudianus, the tribune of the 1st or 2d cohort of the <HI>Lingones.</HI> The 2d cohort of these people was in Britain, as appears from other inscriptions, and in Camden, a smaller <HI>I</HI> is set before the other in this inscription, so as to make it plainly the second. There is, I think, room for it on the stone, but the part where it should be is broken or worn.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 15, p. 290.</BIBL></P>
<P>MAR.T.I D AVG D AVFIDI VS AVFI DIANVS The judicious antiquary, Dr Hunter, of Durham, was so obliging as to send me the copy of the inscription in the margin, which I sound to be very exact when I com∣pared it with the original. The Doctor supposes it has been affixed to the face of an altar, and that the holes in the first line have been for this purpose. The plate is of gold, but very thin, weighing just two guineas, and the letters, which are very pecu∣liar, are raised by an impression made on the inner side by some proper instrument. The plate is so thin that in some places it is struck quite through with the too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that has been used for raising the letters. It may be questioned whether we are to read <HI>Marti Aug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sto,</HI> and suppose
<PB N="361" REF="377"/>the emperor to be represented as it were under the image or notion of the god of war, or <HI>Marti Augusti,</HI> and to suppose the emperor to be the favourite of Mars, or Mars to be the emperor's favourite deity. But as to this matter I shall only refer to what has already been said in a parallel case in Cumberland. The cut of the letters, particularly the <HI>G,</HI> looks like the lower empire; but I know no evidence whereby the particular emperor can be determined with any great probability. We have several other altars at this place, inscribed also to Mars, which have been taken notice of before. I have only to add, that according to Dr Hunter's ac∣count in his letter to me, <Q>This plate was found in the year 1716, in a heap of rubbish cast out to clear an old foundation without the fortification of the garrison, a little south from the balneum.</Q> It is now in the chapter library at Durham.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 16, p. 291.</BIBL></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 6, plate. <HI>Legio vicesima valens victrix fecit.</HI></P>
<P>The corona here is supported by two winged victories, with the usual symbols and the usual drapery and attitude; the boar within may imply that it has been erected after some victory over the Caledonians by this legion. The stone is broken quite through, but the letters notwithstanding are very visible, and none of them lost in the breach.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 16, p. 291.</BIBL></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 7, plate. This and the next are dedicated to Mars, and both but meanly performed. There is no name upon this, so we cannot tell by whom it was erected.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 17, p. 291.</BIBL></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 8, plate. <HI>Deo Marti Caii Aurelii susceptum votum.</HI></P>
<P>The name of the person who dedicated this is Caius Aurelius; but who he was I suppose is unknown. This small altar has a <HI>patera</HI> on one side, and a <HI>praefericulum</HI> on the other.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 18, p. 292.</BIBL></P>

<P>This is inscribed to the local god <HI>Vitires,</HI> but by whom is not said.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 19, p. 292.</BIBL></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 10, plate. These three are all of them small altars, which have no visible inscriptions upon them. They have, I believe, been published only by Mr Gordon. The first has three female figures, which he very pro∣bably supposes to be some of the <HI>matres.</HI> The second has a toad on one side, and the usual sacrificing instru∣ments on the other. I have only represented that side with the toad, as being more curious. The third has a pediment supported by two rude pillasters.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 20, p. 292.</BIBL></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 11, pl. This small altar, with the <HI>boar</HI> on the side, and the inscription much effaced, is also ranked among these Lanchester inscriptions. Mr Ward supposes this altar might be erected to the god <HI>Vitires,</HI> and that the letters <HI>Vit</HI> were upon the first line, as we find them before; the second line is plainly <HI>votum,</HI> and the remain∣ing letters upon the third line he thinks may be part of <HI>Solvit.</HI> This conjecture is favoured by another in∣scription of this county upon an altar dedicated to this deity, which has a boar upon one side: But I think it more likely that the latter part of the inscription has been the name of the person erecting the altar: The last letters are obscure and doubtful.</P>
<P>Besides these before mentioned, which are not at Durham, there are some curiosities remaining yet in the station or town, and among the rest a large stone almost like a mortar. What use it has been for is hard to determine; some of the people call it a font, others who are more skilled, think it has been designed to hold water for the Roman lustrations.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 21, p. 292.</BIBL></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 12, plate. <HI>Deo Marti Aci—.</HI></P>
<P>This small altar was in a stone wall inclosing a field called Broomlawe near the station, belonging to Mr Rowland Wilkinson, but I have now got it into my own possession. The inscription has suffered very much by the weather. The remains of it look like <HI>Deo Marti;</HI> but it cannot now inform us by whom it was con∣secrated, though the last visible letters look like Acilius, a common Roman name, and which, I think, occurs in another of our inscriptions.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 24, p. 293.</BIBL></P>
<P>No. 13, plate. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>The capital of this altar and a small part of the inscription is broken off and lost, and the want of it occa∣sions some difficulty as to the reading. When I first saw this stone it was built up in the wall of an inclosure. I viewed it several times in this situation, but then nothing appearing but the imperfect Greek inscription, the opposite part of the stone being entirely under cover, and built up within the wall. At first view I concluded it to be Greek, but could discover no satisfactory reading. When I had purchased the stone, and got it into
<PB N="362" REF="378"/>my own possession, I was much surprised to see a Latin inscription on the opposite part of the altar. Which is the face and which the back of this altar, or whether like <HI>Janus bifrous,</HI> it was designed to be double faced, I shall not pretend to determine. However to have inscriptions both before and behind is a singular curiosity, of which I remember no parallel instance in Britain, unless the beautiful altar in Camberland be taken for such. But to have two such inscriptions in two different languages is yet more remarkable. Some suspect the Greek inscription not to be genuine, or that it has been added by a different hand and at a different time from the Latin. But I see no just reason to entertain this suspicion, because I cannot discern by whom or with what view it could have been added. So little was this altar regarded or valued, that according to the usual fate of such monuments, it was used as a common stone in the wall.</P>
<P>The high prices of curious Roman coins have produced a great many forgeries, contrived very artfully; but the little regard that has been had for monuments of stone, renders us more secure of their being altoge∣ther genuine. But to return from this digression; the sight of the Latin inscription enabled me to read the remains of the Greek one, I humbly think, with great probability; for I take the greatest part of the one to be much the same with the other, excepting the different language and character. I shall therefore speak to the Latin inscription as being more easy and perfect.—<BIBL><HI>Horsley,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 25, p. 293.</BIBL></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 14, plate. <HI>Aesculapio Titus Flavius Titianus Tribunus votum solvit libentissime merito.</HI></P>
<P>It appears plainly from this, that the altar has been erected by one <HI>Titus Flavius Titianus,</HI> a tribune, but no cohort is mentioned which he commanded. There are several consuls of the name <HI>Titianus,</HI> but the other name are different from that of our tribune. <HI>Tiberius Fabius Titianus</HI> appears five times in the Fasti, and at such a distance of time as to make it probable they were five different persons. This made me suspicious that the <HI>T</HI> in our inscriptions was to be read <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and that the following name might be <HI>Fabius.</HI> But the <HI>Fl</HI> are so distinct on the stone as to leave no room for a doubt. I find <HI>Postumius Titianus</HI> was consul in the year 301, in the time of Diocletian and Maximian. And Almeloveen conjectures, that this may be the same with one who is called in Gruter <HI>T. Fl. Postumius Titianus.</HI> This comes nearest the names of our tribune, but there is no arguing from hence with any probability that these two <HI>Titiani</HI> lived at or near the same time. But thus much for the person erecting this altar; the principal question is, to whom it has been inscribed? We have little to guide us in this but the letters <HI>Pio</HI> at the top, which are certain and distinct. I thought of <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> and other emperors, to whom living or dead, and deified, this epithet <HI>Pius</HI> has been applied, such as <HI>Divo Constantio Pio</HI> and others. Baron Clerk was so obliging as to send me several conjectures about this Latin inscription, a copy of which I transmitted to him. Among other things, this very learned anti∣quary supposes, that <HI>Pio</HI> may be a part of <HI>Aesculapio:</HI> This conjecture is more agreeable and satisfactory than any thing that has occurred to myself, or been offered by any other. I think by the proportion of the altar, that there is not above one line of the inscription wanting, which might be filled up with <HI>Aescula,</HI> or with <HI>Deo Aescula.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Greek inscription, I believe it has stood thus when entire,
<Q><P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></P>
<P><HI>Pro salute Titus Flavius Titianus Trib. Votum solvit libentissime merito.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>I observe, that there are five lines in the Greek inscription, and but four remaining in the Latin, and that the stone is rather higher on the side of the Greek inscription than the other. This induces me to think that the imperfect remains at the top have been a part of the first line of this inscription. I need say nothing to shew how suitable this reading is to the remains on the stone, and to the Latin inscription on the other side. Both the one and the other, I think, appear at first sight. That there were some here in this part of the island, who were willing to pay regard to the gods who presided over health and recovery, appears from the sculpture at Risingham, in Northumberland. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is the Greek word that generally corresponds to <HI>Tribunus</HI> in Latin. In the New Testament <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is rendered <HI>Tribunus,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>cohors</HI> by several. This is the second instance of the Greek character used in such inscriptions in Britain; the other is the famous altar at Corbridge. No doubt they have been erected by some auxiliaries which came from Greece, or the neighbourhood of it, such as the Thracians, &amp;c. some cohorts of which were in Britain.—<BIBL><HI>Hor.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 25. p. 263.</BIBL></P>
<P>The letter from Sir John Clerk to Mr Horsley, we find noted in one from him to Roger Gale, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> in which the conjecture touching the word <HI>Aesculapio</HI> is mentioned, dated from Edinburgh, 12 Apr. 1730. <BIBL><HI>Reliquiae Galcanae,</HI> p 262.</BIBL></P>

<P>When I first saw this stone it was in the corner of a close belonging to Nicholas Greenwell, not far from the former; the upper part was broken off and built up in the wall, and the inscription covered, but upon re∣moving it out of the wall, and comparing the two parts together. I perceived they had been originally united. I have since this got both the pieces into my possession, and so have had an opportunity of placing them one upon another. When this was done they tallied with so much exactness as to render it absolutely certain that they have originally made up one and the same altar. This altar is inscribed to <HI>Jupiter optimus maximus,</HI> and has been erected, as I take, by the vexillation of an Equestrian cohort, of the <HI>Varduli Cranei,</HI> people of Spain. The first word in the second line must, I think, have been <HI>Vexillatio,</HI> and the <HI>o</HI> perhaps has been a little one, and added near the top of the <HI>I,</HI> as we sometimes find it. I once thought I discerned it there, but own myself jealous that my imagination assisted my eye sight. The next word is plainly <HI>Cohors,</HI> but who the peo∣ple have been of which this cohort consisted must be more distinctly considered. When I first viewed the two pieces as they lay separate, I read the name <HI>Vardiorum.</HI> These are a people of Dalmatia, mentioned with some variation of the name by Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolomy, but since I got them home and put them together, I have found that by the largeness of the interval there must have been two letters between the <HI>D</HI> and <HI>O</HI> in the third line. I have also discovered the sure remains of a <HI>V</HI> after the <HI>D</HI> besides the imperfect letter before the <HI>O,</HI> I make no doubt therefore but the name is <HI>Vardulorum.</HI> The two first letters in the fourth line of which there are any remains, seem plainly to have been <HI>CR,</HI> which I would have concluded to have been the initial letters of the name <HI>Cranei,</HI> and to have been read <HI>Vardulorum, Craneorum,</HI> or <HI>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Craneorum</HI> if my first conjecture concerning <HI>Craneis</HI> in the Richester inscription could have been supported: But that being rejected, I am more at a loss for any probable reading of this part of the inscription now before us. I would gladly still make use of the one as a key to the other. And therefore if <HI>Consecraneis</HI> be read in the former, I am most inclined to suppose <HI>CR</HI> to be some part of an abbreviation of the same word in this. Possibly it has been <HI>CSCR,</HI> which supply seems not unsuitable to the vacant space on the stone, and perhaps <HI>ET</HI> has been at the end of the preceding line in letters of the same size; thus it would be <HI>Fardulorum et Consecraneorum</HI> in this as <HI>Vardulorum cum Consecraneis</HI> in the other. <HI>EQ</HI> in this fourth line is no doubt for <HI>Equestris</HI> or <HI>Equitum.</HI> The character at the end of this line is much the same with an <HI>M</HI> that is used for <HI>Mille</HI> in one of the inscriptions of Glasgow, but that it here signifies 1000 horse is more than I dare venture to affirm. We have <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> &amp; <HI>co∣hors milliaria</HI> and <HI>millenaria</HI> in Vegetius and the Notitia.

<HEAD>Extract from Mr Gale's answer.</HEAD>
<P>As for the <HI>OM</HI> they can have been nothing but the remains of <HI>Jovi optimo maximo,</HI> and perhaps what follows is the remains of <HI>Vexillatio,</HI> though I am not without my scruples as to that. In the first place. I do not remember I ever met with such an expression as <HI>Vexillatio cohortis,</HI> or <HI>cohortium,</HI> though frequently with a <HI>Vexillatio legionis,</HI> which I take to imply a detachment sent off from the legion under a <HI>Vexillu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> where we meet with those <HI>Vexiliationes,</HI> Leg.

Pomponius Mela expressly calls the <HI>Varduli Gens una.</HI> As for the <HI>Cranei</HI> upon the Richester stone, I shall shew you plainly by and by that it is quite another thing. To this I am obliged to add, that I cannot find among my old geographers such a people as the <HI>Cranei</HI> or <HI>Granei</HI> in Spain, or any where else, therefore should be glad to know where you met with them. In the Richester inscription, &amp;c. the <HI>Cum con</HI> — I read with the be∣ginning of the seventh line <HI>cum consecraneis,</HI> a word not very common, but you have it in Julius Capitoli∣nus's life of Gordian. c. 14. <HI>Sacrati commilitiones uno etiam mei consecranei,</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD><HI>Extract of a letter from Dr Hunter, of Durham, to Roger Gale, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> dated</HI> 17 <HI>May,</HI> 1735.</HEAD>
<P>I have had the happiness to meet with these two altars found lately at Lanchester, in the Roman sta∣tion; the first within the ancient fortification, having its bottom broken off, and the initial letters of the last two lines. That of the last has undoubtedly been a <HI>D.</HI> The other was found in the next ground near the remains of the baths.</P>

<P>These, with two portable altars, without any inscriptions, and a figure of Ceres, are presented to the worshipful James Clavering, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who, in respect to such valuable antiquities, intends to entertain them in the avenues of his beautiful garden at Greencroft, about a mile distant from Lanchester.</P>
<P>Pliny is the only author we can gather any thing from remarkable concerning the Varduli, and that so very concise, I think deserves a place here. In conventum Cluniensem Varduli ducant populos xiv. ex quibus Albanenses tantum nominare libeat. Nat. Hist. lib. iii. c. 3. sect. 4, of the last Paris edition; and in lib. iv. c. 20, sect. 34, he enumerates the <HI>Vardulorum Oppida, Morosgi, Menosca, Vesperies Amanum Por∣tus ubi nunc Flaviobriga Colonia,</HI> where Mr Hardoiun recites the modern names. And as Gruter's almost infinite collection affords no inscription where the <HI>Varduli</HI> are named, I presume the Roman oeconomy un∣der the emperor Trajan, by descent a Spaniard, if not sooner, had abolished the old distinctions of sepa∣rate governments, and reduced the whole province under one general name, Hispania, which afterwards the Notitia Imperij occidentalis divides into three consular provinces, under the direction of four presi∣dents, viz. Farraconenis, Carthagineus Tingitania, Insula Balearium, and places no garrison of the Varduli in any fortress in the eastern or western empire.</P>
<P>The inscription upon the first is cut very fair. In comparing my copy with Mr Horsley's altar, N<SUP>o</SUP> 26, Durham, belonging also to Lanchester, which is at present in the dean and chapter's library here, I ob∣serve a difference between the first letter of the fourth line, where <HI>C</HI> is very apparent: If my copy is true, I hope my reading may be allowed. The figure I call a Ceres is well cut; the left hand leaning upon a globe, which I take to be a <HI>Lapis Molaris,</HI> prompts me to term it so. One of the small altars has a toad upon the side, the same as one of the three mentioned by Mr Horsley in our library.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD><HI>Answer to the preceding letter by R. Gale, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> dated London,</HI> 7 <HI>June,</HI> 1735.</HEAD>
<P>As for the two inscriptions you sent me, I will venture to give my thoughts upon them, &amp;c. The first of them is very curious, as it gives us the name of a <HI>Legatus Augustalis</HI> and propraetor hitherto unknown in Britain, and which ought, as I think, to be read as follows, <HI>Numini Augusti &amp; genio cohortis secundae Vor∣dulorum
<PB N="365" REF="381"/>Equitate Milliariae sub Antistio advento, Legato Augusti propraetore. F. Tiranus Tribunus dat dedicat∣que rite.</HI> To read <HI>GR</HI> in the fourth line, <HI>Gregalium,</HI> is not a little doubtful: It cannot well be supposed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an altar to the deity of the emperor, and at the same time to the genius of the common soldiers, exclusive of the genius of the officers, of which he himself was one; and how to read it otherwise is as uncertain, if the letters are <HI>GR,</HI> as in your copy. But if they are <HI>CR,</HI> as on the altar given us by Mr Horsley, Durham, N<SUP>o</SUP> 26, in his Brit. Rom. and which you say has <HI>C</HI> very ap∣parent instead of <HI>G,</HI> they may denote <HI>civium Romanorum,</HI> and those <HI>Varduli</HI> people of Spain, and admitted to the freedom of the city of Rome for some extraordinary merit, or by some emperor's savour, perhaps their countryman Trajan's. This was a privilege frequently conferred upon foreigners, even whole towns and nations, and at last communicated by Antoninus Pius <HI>omnibus in commune subjectis,</HI> by which it seems as if this altar had been erected before this general grant of that emperor; for it is no great honour or ad∣vantage for these <HI>Varduli</HI> to value themselves upon, if they had enjoyed it only in common with all the rest of the world. Mons. Spanheim observes, <HI>Exercit. prima ad constitution. Imp. Antonini de civ. Rom. quod sub. M. Antonino Imp. civitate donati essent quicunque in Romani orbis provinciis aut oppidis delecti essent milites ut praesidarij in imperij limitibus constituerentur.</HI> This seems contradictory to the first mentioned grant, since it only confers the freedom of the city upon the soldiers in garrison on the frontiers of the empire, and the other gives it to all the subjects of the Roman empire without exception. Perhaps the soldiers had this ad∣vantage given them at first, and upon finding the encouragement it gave them to defend the countries where they were quartered, it was thought adviseable to admit all the subjects of the empire to the same privilege, to interest them the more in preserving the whole from the attacks of the barbarians: But there has been no small uncertainty among the learned to which of the Antonins this constitution is owing, some attri∣buting it to Antoninus Pius, others to Marcus Aurelius, and Mr Spanheim with great reason to Antoninus Caracalla, from Dion Cassius chiefly, who tells us this privilege was granted to him <HI>omnibus qui in urbe Ro∣mano erant,</HI> not so much for the honour and advantage of it to the people, as for the filling his treasury, since it made them liable to the payment of several taxes, from which they were before exempted; so that the soldiers had this benefit conferred on them for their services, and the rest of the people afterwards most likely to drain their purses. In Gruter's Thesaur. p. 455, 6, is mentioned <HI>Tantistius praefectus alae sulpiciae C. R. i. e. Civium Romanorum:</HI> And in p. 459, 8, <HI>L. Praesentius praefectus cob.</HI> 1. <HI>Afr. C. R. E.</HI> which is read <HI>Praefectus cohortis primae Afrorum civium Romanorum Equitate,</HI> just the same as this at Langchester, only changing <HI>Afrorum</HI> into <HI>Vardulorum.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>cohors Equitata</HI> was composed partly of horse, partly of foot, as Vegetius informs us, lib. ii. cha. 2. <HI>Prima cohors habet pedites mille centum &amp; quinque; Equites loricatos centum triginta duos et appellantur mil∣liaria.</HI> I must own the cohors in this inscription is called <HI>secunda Vardulorum,</HI> of which an inscription was found at Riechester, in Northumberland.—[See Horsley's Brit. Rom. North. 94.] This second <HI>cohors</HI> of the <HI>Varduli</HI> might however be the <HI>prima auxiliaria</HI> of some legion, perhaps the sixth, and in more esteem for some eminent service or fortunate accident than the first, not dignified with the honourable title and privileges <HI>civium Romanorum,</HI> perhaps also independent of any legion. And after all, the sole reason why one of the cohorts was called the first, and the other the second, might have been from the priority of time when they were first raised. This <HI>Antistius Adventus</HI> seems also to have been <HI>Legatus Augusti,</HI> and pro∣praetor in Belgium, from an altar found near Utrecht, where he is called <HI>Caius Antistius</HI> (vid.

<P>The <HI>L. A.</HI> in the last line of the other inscription, I believe, stands for <HI>Lubenti Animo,</HI> and not for <HI>Libertus Augusti,</HI> there being nothing in it leading us to such a person. There is nothing else in it of curiosity to be satisfied or difficulty to be cleared.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD><HI>Extract of a letter from Sir John Clerk, touching the above, dated from Pennycuik,</HI> 26 <HI>June,</HI> 1735.</HEAD>
<P>There were many barbarities in the language of the lower empire, and therefore it is hard to determine with any certainty about letters. I cannot approve of the doctor's <HI>Gregalium,</HI> though I believe he would be vastly sond of it, and pleased with the invention. Your <HI>Civium Romanorum</HI> is certainly right, if the
<PB N="366" REF="382"/>letters be not <HI>G. R.</HI> for <HI>Germanicorum,</HI> for I have seen, if I remember right, some such inscription, though I cannot tell where. You will be surprised at my notion of <HI>Germanicorum,</HI> if I do not explain to you the reading of the altar so as to comprehend such a word. If the letters are <HI>G. R.</HI> in the sense I take them the reading must relate to the <HI>Cohors Milliaria</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It is hard to conceive how <HI>Cohors Milliaria Germanicorum</HI> should dedicate an altar <HI>Genio Cob. II. Vardulorum;</HI> be∣sides if it was so, the reading upon the altar would have been <HI>Cohors Mill. German.</HI> and not <HI>Germ. Cob. Mill.</HI></Q>—R. G.</NOTE>, as dedicating an altar to the genius of the <HI>Cohors Vardulorum</HI> upon some signal service done. <HI>F</HI> must be <HI>fecit,</HI> and the last letter <HI>R. restituit.</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>This must have been the figure of the goddess Fortune seated, the wheel that is by her side, and the cornucopia she has in her left hand, and the globe at her foot on the other side, do all shew it to be Fortune, though one of her arms, as well as her head; be now broken off. There are several altars at Durham inscrib∣ed to Fortune; one found at Lanchester inscribed <HI>Fortunae Au∣gusti;</HI> perhaps this has been the image of that Fortune; and by this image with the globe at her feet, may be expressed the em∣peror's universal dominion. The modern letters that are now cut on the base, may easily, at first view, deceive one into an opinion that the image is not Roman or antique; but this only shews when it was found, and by whom, namely in the year 1700, by Henry Ornsby, of Lanchester, whose wife's name was Elizabeth. To disguise this figure further, there stands on it a Mercury's head, as is plain from the petasus, so that I look upon it as certain that the head and body have belonged to different figures, though now the one is generally set upon the other.— This image of Fortune I take to be the same with a figure in Mr Gordon, which I can find no where explained. He has made the proportion far too large for the rest of the figures, and pos∣sibly had forgot the dimensions.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This figure, about twenty-four inches in height, remains in the dean and chapter's library at Durham, and the proper head is to be seen there: The sculpture is uncommonly good, and we prefer cutting the representation from a drawing made in 1776, to a mere imitation of Mr. Horsley's plate.</P>
<P><Q>This represents a curious sculpture which is on a stone built up in the vestry wall of the church. It is much like that at Netherby, though there is some difference in the drapery, and here is no corona on the head, but only the hair plaited. I believe this to be a genius as well as the other, or at least the emperor represented as such.</Q></P>
<PB N="358" REF="374"/></NOTE> the first name of this town has been <HI>Glanchester,</HI> com∣posed as usual of the first syllable of the old Roman name, with the word <HI>Chester</HI> annexed to it: The <HI>G,</HI> for the sake of an easier pronunciation, might be dropt. If <HI>Glanoventa</HI> signifies a bank, or hill near a river, <HI>ven</HI> or <HI>vent</HI> in the British tongue signifying a river, the situation of the station at Lanchester is not un∣suitable to this etymology; for it stands on high ground, with a river on one side, and a rivulet on the other, and not far from either. I know two of our greatest modern antiquaries, Roger Gale, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and Dr Hunter, of Durham, suppose Lanchester to be the ancient <HI>Longovicus,</HI> the affinity of name having, as I presume, inclined them to this opinion; but I have a pretty strong reason to
<PB N="359" REF="375"/>
offer why this cannot be the <HI>Longovicus</HI> in the Notitia, garrisoned by the <HI>Numerus Longovicariorum,</HI> which is this: It is evident that some order is observed in the
<PB N="360" REF="376"/>
Notitia in setting down the several places, and <HI>Longovicus</HI> is set among the most southerly that were under the <HI>Dux Britanniarum;</HI> it is put down as more to the
<PB N="361" REF="377"/>
south than <HI>Lavatrae</HI> or <HI>Verterae,</HI> and next to <HI>Derventio,</HI> all which are mentioned in the Notitia as well as the Itinerary; and this suits much better with the situa∣tion
<PB N="362" REF="378"/>
of Lancaster in Lancashire, than Lanchester in the county of Durham; and as none of the military ways on which any of the itinera proceed seem to have
<PB N="363" REF="379"/>
passed by Lanchester, so this may be a good reason why <HI>Longovicus</HI> is not men∣tioned in the Itinerary, though we have it in the Notitia. Upon the whole,
<PB N="364" REF="380"/>
therefore, I see no place bids so fair to be the <HI>Glanoventa</HI> in the Itinerary as Lanchester, especially if we consider how the rest of the iter goes on when this foundation is laid.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="381"/><Q>The station and town have been situated on a lingula between the river Browney and the rivulet Smallup. This rivulet runs into the Browney a little
<PB N="366" REF="382"/>
below the station, and Browney loses itself and name in the river Were, at Sun∣derland bridge, two miles south of Durham. The station is two furlongs dis∣tant from Smallup, and not so much from Browney. It has a high situation, and yet the prospect is bounded quite round about with hills or rising grounds,
<PB N="367" REF="383"/>
that are not at a very great distance. The same sort of situation is observable at Elsdon, in Northumberland, and several other places. This situation has this advantage, that an enemy could not come over these rising grounds, but they must immediately appear to the garrison.</Q></P>
<P>Mr Horsley has delineated this station of an exact square figure, whereas it is oblong, one hundred and seventy-four paces from north to south, and from east to west one hundred and sixty within the wall. It had survived many ages less mutilat∣ed than any structure of the kind, in the northern counties, but of late many of the stones have been removed to inclose the adjacent lands, and make the roads; and the proprietor is regularly destroying this piece of antiquity. In some parts the wall yet remains almost perfect; the outside is perpendicular, twelve feet in height, built of ashler work, in regular courses, each stone being about nine inches deep and twelve long: By some large stones which lie near the foot of the wall, it is evident there was a parapet, with a walk near three feet wide at the top. At the west entrance a stone, as represented in the cut, was lately dug up, from which
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the drawing was made in 1783, and shews that such fortifications had more orna∣ment than is commonly apprehended: The inside of the vallum is built of ashler work, but from the ground work upwards, at the distance of about twenty inches, it diminishes gradually in thickness, in steps running parallel through the whole structure, by which those within might ascend the wall, and instantly line the para∣pet with troops on the approach of an enemy. The wall where broken through is eight feet thick at the present surface, diminishing to somewhat more than four at the top; the interior part between the facings is formed of thin stones, placed inclining, feather-wise, tier above tier, run full of mortar mixed with rough gravel. What is remarkable, there appear no <HI>throughs,</HI> as the masons call those stones which bind the buildings by going through from face to face, or into the heart of the wall. There was an entrance in the center of each side of the square, and to the west a wide ditch; the ground has been cultivated many years on the other sides, as well as within the vallum. We did not discern any inscription on the walls save L. xxxv.
<PB N="368" REF="384"/>
Mr Greenwell, of the Ford, has preserved in his garden wall several rude effigies lately found here; the most remarkable are represented in the cuts.</P>

</FIGURE>The cup used at divine offices in the church has a cover, which was found in this station; the date on it (1571) is presumed to be the time of finding. It is a Roman pate∣ra, and is also represented in the cut.</P>
<P>The last time we visited this station, in August 1783, we discovered at a gate on the west side of the road, the pillar represented, which it is presumed stood on the
<FIGURE>

Watling-street: It is now fixed as a gate post, and is inscribed, as we apprehend, to <HI>Marcus Antonius Gor∣dianus;</HI> the <HI>F</HI> in the last line has been compound, to make the word <HI>Felici.</HI></P>
<P>An extensive division of common lands within this parish took place by virtue of an act of parliament, in the twelfth year of his present majesty, on which, it was computed, twenty thousand acres were to be inclosed. The commissioners were impowered to dispose of lands, to raise money for making all the roads, and paying expences; for which purpose they sold one thousand five hundred and fifty-one acres for 8174l. or there∣abouts, and three hundred acres were set out and vest∣ed in the justices of the peace of the county, for raising money to compensate the owners of allotments, such damages as they should sustain by the lord bishop of Durham, or his lessees, winning mines therein: But being afterwards considered, that it would be more expedient to sell an allotment of three hundred acres, subject to a rent charge of 30l. a year, an act of parliament was obtained to carry such sale into effect, and Thomas White, of Retford, in the county of Nottingham, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> be∣came
<PB N="369" REF="385"/>
the purchaser. He set a most laudable example on this division, and planted two hundred and eleven acres with forest trees, and sixteen acres with fruit trees, which, under the shelter of rising plantations, promise to answer the adventurer's expectations. Of the three hundred acres purchased, Mr White has planted one hundred and fifty acres more with forest trees. This vast tract of country, which was barren, desart, and dreary, where the perplexed traveller wandered in the am∣biguous tracks with anxiety, is now inclosed, much of it cultivated, and intersected with direct roads, made in the turnpike manner, fit for the reception of any car∣riage; innumerable buildings are scattered over the prospect; merchandise has found an expeditious passage to villages heretofore almost inaccessible, but in the very midst of summer; and the inhabitants, greatly multiplied, are chearful and prosperous. In one farmhold, totally separated from all ancient inclosures, in the summer of 1783, we observed thirty-four stacks of corn in one yard, the produce of new cultivations. Many parts lie very high, the prospect consequently exten∣sive: At a point where the roads leading to Durham, Hexham, Chester, and Lan∣chester meet, the view is noble, and commands a vast extent of country, even to the mouths of the rivers Tyne, Were, and Tees, besides a distant prospect to the west and north.</P>
<P>The chapelry of ESH is mentioned before as appertaining to the first prebend of Lanchester. The church was a very mean structure, being in length from east to west about nineteen yards, and five yards and a half wide: In the year 1769 bishop Crewe's trustees gave one hundred pounds towards rebuilding it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Esh chapel.—Dedicated to St Michael.—Col.

In the thirty-sixth of the same bishop, Thomas the son and heir of William died seised of the same manors, and the male line became extinct, he leaving a daughter and heiress, Johan, who married Robert de Bland, who in her right possessed the manor
<PB N="370" REF="386"/>
of Esh, with Ulshaw and Heleigh, members thereof. The family of Esh possessed a city house in the Bailey, Durham, built against the castle wall. We do not find that Bland had any issue, but Johan, his widow, married to her second husband Thomas Colvill, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who, in the seventeenth year of bishop Skirlaw, died seised in her right of this manor. Colvill's widow married a Forster, and by an inquisition taken on the death of Richard Forster her son and heir, in the second year of bishop Nevil, it is stated, that Johan, by a deed of settlement, dated at Staindrop, the last day of June, in the year 1428, conveyed to trustees the manor and vills of Skyrnyngham, Bermton, Esh, Ulshawe, Estheryngton, 1 mess. c. acres of land in Roule, 6 mess. cclx. acres of land, and seventeen shillings rent in Middle Herryng∣ton and West Herryngton, 2 mess. cc. acres in Cornshowe, 2 mess. and c. acres of land, &amp;c. called the Hugh, in Esh, a close there called the Neuparke, 1 mess. and 60 acres called Undersyd, in Esh, and 1 mess. called Ratonrawe. No licence was obtained. That the manors and vills of Esh and Ulshawe, the Hugh and Undersyde, were held of the bishop by military service of the value of twelve marks. That Matilda, the wife of John Walkerfield, sister and heir of the before-named Richard Forster, had released her right in the premisses to the trustee, whereby he was in power to make his deed of indenture, dated the 1st of November, the eighteenth of Henry VI. whereby he granted to Walter Boynton, arm. 3 mess. cxl. acres of land and meadow, in Esh, Middle Herryngton, and West Herryngton for life, and after his death to William, the son of William Hodilston, and the heirs of his body, remainder to John Walkerfield, the son of the before-named Matilda, the sister of Richard Forster, and the heirs of his body, remainder to Alice, John's sister, remainder to the afore-named Matilda, and the heirs of her body, remainder to the right heirs of Roger de Esh. And by another indenture, dated the 4th day of the same month of November, he granted to the same John Walkerfield, son of Matilda, son and heir of Richard Forster, who was the son and heir of John, the son of Thomas, lord of Esh, the manors and vills of Esh and Ulshawe, a mess. and c. acres in Roule the Hugh New Park and Undersyde in Esh, 2 mess. and cc. acres in Corneshowe, 1 mess. and c. acres in Heugh, and to the heirs of his body, re∣mainder to Alice his sister, and the heirs of her body, remainder to Matilda, Rich∣ard's sister, and the heirs of her body, remainder to William Hodilston, Matilda's brother, and the heirs of his body, remainder to the right heirs of Roger de Esh. The manor of Esh and lands there were held of the bishop by military service, and the lands in Corneshowe were held of Johan countess of Westmereland.— How the remainders took place it is difficult to ascertain.

This family had large possessions in the county. Isabell, the wife of John, died in the third year of bishop Skirlaw, and on the inquisition then taken the manor and lands thereto appertaining are set forth at sixty shil∣lings and ten-pence rent, value twenty-six shillings and eight-pence. About the year 1429, Thomas Birtley sold the manor to William Chaunceller, who settled the same on Thomas his son, by Alice Wandesforth, and the heirs of his body, remainder to Richard another son, and the heirs of his body, remainder to Mar∣garet the wife of William Claxton, Richard's sister, and the heirs of her body, re∣mainder to the right heirs of William Claxton in fee simple. By virtue of the before stated limitations this manor became the estate of the Osberns of Sheles, by Alice the wife of John Osbern, who was the daughter of Alice Myddleton, and the grand daughter of Beatrix, Thomas Chaunceller's sister. The manor is des∣cribed in the above inquisition to consist of a new built hall <HI>cum Stramine tect.</HI> roofed with straw, an ancient ruined house, a stone built chamber, and one hundred acres of land.</P>

In bishop Hatfield's Survey it is set forth, that <Q>Richard le Scrope held the vill of Langley, formerley the estate of Henry de Insula;</Q> and by the inquisition taken at his death in the sixteenth year of bishop Skirlaw<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. Rich. le Scrope, 16 bishop Skirlaw, cor. W. de Claxton, chiv. 1404.</NOTE>, it appears he held the same by the fourth part of a knight's fee, paying yearly seven shillings at the bishop's exchequer, and performing suit at three chief courts: He was succeeded by Richard son of Roger, then an infant of ten years old. By an inquisition taken in the fifteenth year of bishop Langley, 1421, on the death of Richard lord Scrope of Bolton, it is stated, that he had divested himself of the manor and vill of Lang∣ley some time before his death, and that Ralph Eure, chiv. was seised thereof to him and his heirs; and by an inquisition taken on his death, in the seventeenth year of the same bishop, he appears to have died possessed thereof by the name of <HI>Maneria &amp; villa de Langley &amp; le waterfall cum p'tin. que h'uit ex feoffo.

<PB N="382" REF="398"/>
Richard le Scrope and others had been enfeoffed in this manor, with divers other estates, by virtue of the licence of bishop Nevill, but the trust is not specified: The feoffor Henry left John his son and heir, who was grandfather of Henry after mention∣ed, and probably the confidence reposed consisted of divers limitations in tail, by vir∣tue of which it descended to Henry lord Scrope the feoffor's grandson, who by the inscription after mentioned, is presumed to have built the hall, of which the pre∣sent ruins are remains. An engraving of this inscription was published in the Antiquarian Repertory in 1775, from a drawing made by Mr Rob. Hutchinson, in 1771, and we presume communicated by Thomas Gyll, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> with the following account<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 285, 286.</NOTE>. <Q>At Langley hall, in the parish of Lanchester, is a mantle-piece of stone, over a large fire place, with an inscription thereon in capital letters: The inscription relates to Henry lord Scrope, of Bolton, in Yorkshire, who married Margaret the daughter of Thomas lord Dacre, of Gilsland, in Cumberland. The arms on the second quarter are those of Tibetot, or Tiptoft, an heiress of which family married an ancestor of the said Henry lord Scrope, whose coat of arms are engraved with hers, and the same are depicted in the upper windows on the south part of the parish church of Richmond, in Yorkshire. The escut∣cheon, by the division on the wife's side, on the right hand, looks as if intended for him and his two wives, for he was twice married; but the arms on the side of the wives are so worn away that they are not distinguishable. The upper∣most seems as if something like bars or barry were in them; bars were in the arms of Greystock: The other should be Scrope of Upsal, his second wife, whose name was Alice, daughter of Thomas lord Scrope, of Upsal, by Margaret his wife, daughter of Thomas lord Dacres, grandfather of Thomas lord Dacres above mentioned.</Q> We must observe further on this inscription, that the lines are not to be read direct, but are broken in the center, and stands thus, so far as the letters are distinct:
<Q><L>HENRICVS. § SCROPE. § MIL.</L>
<L>XI. § DOMINVS. DE § BOLTO—.</L>
<L>—ET § VXOR § EIVS § FILI—</L>
<L>— DACR § ET GRAISTOKE.</L></Q>
by this it appears he was the eleventh lord of Bolton, and she the daughter of lord Dacre, of Greystoke. Mr Allan further illustrates this matter by the genealo∣gical table on the next page.</P>
<P>From the family of Scrope, Langley came into the family of Paulet, by marriage with one of the natural daughters of Emanuel Scrope, earl of Sunderland, and not many years ago was sold by Mr Paulet, son of lord William Paulet, who was the second son of the first duke of Bolton, to Henry Lambton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Lambton, late member of parliament for the city of Durham, and is now the property of John Lambton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> the heir general of that ancient family.</P>

In the twenty-sixth year of that prelate it appears by an inquisition taken on the death of John de Howden, that he died seised of the manor of Rowley, which we presume implies East Rowley, held of the bishop <HI>in capite,</HI> by homage, fealty, suit at three chief courts, and six shillings and eight-pence rent. He left no issue, and his estates descended to his sister's daughters, one of whom, Agnes, married Thomas Beke to her second husband, having issue by her first husband Hugh del Redhugh a son, Hugh, who was heir to this manor, and possessed the same after her death, in the eighth year of bishop Skirlaw: The male line of the family of Redhugh, as observed before, fail∣ing, their possessions were severed among coheiresses. The possessions of Grey, af∣ter being in Robert de Nevill for a short time, came to Thomas Grey, who was attainted, and were restored to Ralph Grey, with Conset as before mentioned. The family of Bland held of the prior of Durham a small parcel of land here.</P>

They also possessed <HI>Green-lawe</HI> near Collierly, which the Redhughs afterwards acquired. Robert Rhodes died in the seventeenth year of bishop Booth; and by an inquisi∣tion then taken, it is stated, that he had conveyed this manor, with the lands called Greenlawe, held under Ralph earl of Westmoreland, by his deed dated the 1st of April, fourteenth Edward IV. to John Hebburn and William Lawson, but no trust is specified; and that he died without issue, leaving Alicia, the wife of Richard Bainbrigg, daughter of John Rhodes his brother his heir. This manor was divided by two parceners, and in the seventeenth year of bishop Dudley, Johan, the wife of Robert Robson, died seised of one moiety thereof, with a moiety of Greenlawe and Smether Strother, leaving Thomas Hodgson, her son by a former husband, her heir. The records before us do not point out how the other moiety descended.</P>

<P>The reader will revert to the account given of this place in the annals of the bishops <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 52.</NOTE>, where he will find more at large the particulars here briefly recapitulated. Bishop Eardulph, who was the eighteenth prelate of the church of Lindisfarn, fly∣ing with the remains of St Cuthbert before the barbarians who made their sacrile∣gious descent on that island, not settling at Crake, where he sat down for a time, rested at Chester, and there began to build a church about the year 883; and the religious body retained this residence till the year 995, when they rested at Dur∣ham. Tanner says, the See removed hither "had probably a chapter of monks, or rather secular canons attending it."—Chester entertained the same re∣ligious society that existed at Lindisfarn, and they were again translated to Dur∣ham, so it is pretty certain there was no establishment of monks here, but of seculars. Egelric, the fourth bishop of Chester, was induced to take down the humble building of wood which his predecessor erected for his episcopal church,
<PB N="388" REF="405"/>
and raised one more magnificent: Finding great treasures, he conveyed the same out of his bishopric to enrich the monastery of Peterborough, from whence he came: We have already offered conjectures on this treasure-trove, and therefore shall not dwell on it here. On the introduction of canons regular into the cathe∣dral church of Durham, Chester, it is said, was one of the churches appointed to receive the seculars, who, without having committed offence, were removed from the seat of dignity, and no doubt were provided for in the most ample manner.</P>

<HEAD>Extract from the foundation of Chester deanry, with the king's inspeximus of the pope's confirmation, and the ordination of bishop Beke, with the king's assent, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><Q>WE do ordain, &amp;c. That the aforesaid church of Chester shall from henceforth become and be a col∣legiate church, and there shall be in the same hereafter one dean and seven prebends, so that the dean be in perpetual sacerdotal order, taking the cure of souls, and keeping continually personal residence there, &amp;c. &amp;c. And to the intent he may better bear and undergo the premisses, we will and firmly ordain, that to the deanry shall be totally assigned and annexed the revenues as well in the church of Chester, as in the chapels aforesaid, (Tanfield and Lamesley) to wit, of mortuaries, wool, lamb, milk, calves, hay, lint, hemp, hens, geese, pigs, and of all minute tithes and personal tithes, together with the rent and court of the te∣nants of the church and the town of Chester, and of Waldridge, and the whole dominical land of Herver∣ton. And we do assign also unto the said deanry the messuages to the said chapelry of Lamesley and Tan∣field belonging with their courts and demesnes. Provided and excepted, that the prebendaries of both these places shall have a certain portion or part of our limitation, wherein they may competently repose their corn. The dean shall also have the fishing in the river of Wear, and the tithe of fishing. Moreover every one of the prebendaries who shall have the three first prebends, shall find of his own cost and charge one vicar chaplain; and touching the other four prebendaries remaining, every prebendary shall have a vicar deacon ministering in the same church in canonical habit, and shall observe the manner of singing ac∣cording to the use of the church of York or Salisbury. And that every one of them shall be weekly obser∣vers of their turns, &amp;c. And that this community may not beget and bring forth discord, but that every one may content himself with his own, we have thought good to distinguish these prebends in this wise, that is to say, that unto the first prebend shall belong the predial tithes universal of <HI>Great Lumley, Little Lumley, Lampton, Woodsend,</HI> as also the tithes of the coal mines: To the second prebend of <HI>Lamesley, Kib∣blesworth, Ravensworth, Darncrook, Hedley, Ladesend, Tugersland, Ravensholme,</HI> and <HI>Newhouses:</HI> To the third of <HI>Pelton, Pokerley, Pelaw, Picktree, Tribley, Edmundsley, Stevesley,</HI> and <HI>Nettlesworth:</HI> To the fourth of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Whithall:</HI> To the fifth of <HI>Tanfield, Lynce, Crook, Tanfield-leigh, Stanley, Stanley-hall, Caldsit,</HI> and <HI>Steels:</HI> To the sixth of <HI>Birtley, Harverton-moor,</HI> and <HI>Harden:</HI> To the seventh of <HI>Ulston, Urpeth,</HI> and <HI>Twisle.</HI> And for all the residue of the parish of Chester, viz. the predial tithes of Plawsworth and of Wald∣ridge, and of all the wastes within the same parish, that shall hereafter be reduced into tillage, we do as∣sign and allot the same unto the common residence within the parish of Chester, amongst them only equally to be divided who for three months space at least in the year continually or for the most part shall make their personal residence in the same church, &amp;c.—<BIBL><HI>Randal's MSS.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>

<P><PB N="389" REF="406"/>A suit having long depended between Sire Walter de Clifford, cl. on the one part, and Master Alaine, of Esyngwalde, on the other, the former claiming the rectorship or parsonage of Chester, and the latter alledging that he had for cer∣tain lawful causes been deprived by Robert (de Insula) bishop of Durham and himself by the same bishop substituted in his place, both parties being unwilling to be any further entangled with suits and contentions, yielded up all their rights in the said church into the hands of Anthony (Bek) bishop of Durham, and sub∣mitted it to his ordinance, together with the chapels, lands, fruits, and revenues unto the same belonging. The bishop finding the church sufficiently endowed, and yet ill served, ordained it should for the future be collegiate, and that there should be in it a dean and seven prebendaries, the dean to maintain two chap∣lain's assistants, and other necessary clerks, and to repair the chancel, and find ministers for the chapels of Tanfield and Lamesley; for the defraying of which ex∣pence he assigned him the altarage of the said church and chapels, with other re∣venue, and the fishery on the river Were, together with the rent and court of the tenants of the church in the town of Chester and of Walrige, and the whole do∣minical land of Hervertone. In like manner he regulated the several prebends, and the manner of the canons sitting in their stalls, and all other particulars as in other collegiate churches, and ordered the tenth part of the portion of every non-resident to be given to the residents; and in case there were no residents, then to the use of the church or poor. This ordination was made by the bishop, at Auck∣land, in the third year of his consecration, was confirmed by king Edward I. at Berwick, on the 12th of June, 1292, and by Pope Boniface VIII. at Rome, in the Ides of March, 1296, in the third year of his pontificacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Chester on the street deanry.—True value 40l.—Reg.

<P>Number of burials in the last year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—Computed number of inhabitants 4890.</P></NOTE>. It is a handsome edifice of stone, covered with lead; the tower from the foundation is square, but when it rises above the roof, takes an octagonal form, and in this part is apparently much more modern; it is finished with a most elegant stone spire, one of the finest in the north of England, being in the whole one hundred and fifty-six feet in height: The accurate plate will save much description. The whole length of this building on the outside is fifty-four paces. The church within is of a regular form, having two side ailes, separated from the nave by five pointed arches supported on pillars, two of which towards the east in each row are light and round, but the third, an odd conceit in the architect, is formed of two cylin∣ders put together, the broad sides facing the nave and ailes: The nave is in length from the foot of the tower thirty paces, and in width, including the ailes, from the north door to the south, fifteen paces: The pulpit is placed against the center pillar in the south row; the sounding board heavy with rude carving. The whole church is decently stalled, and kept clean; the pavement is new; there is a handsome white marble font, and a gallery at the west end: The south aile is lighted with three regular windows of three lights each, under pointed arches; in the eastern one are two coats of arms. The chancel has been altered in modern times, and is only six paces wide by eleven long; the arch which separates it is supported on light brackets, and the stalls are without much ornament. There are four windows to the south, and a large modern-sash to the east.</P>
<P>The north aile, which now is solely appropriated to and filled with a line of tombs of the Lumley family, has anciently been further extended, three arches and two columns appearing in the outside wall, as if some small cloister formerly lay contiguous to the church: The windows discover the alteration, which per∣haps was made when the tombs were placed, for there are three square windows within the old arches, and a window under a pointed arch beyond them. Before

Before we speak of the monuments, it must be noted, that bishop Matthew granted licence in 1594, authorizing John baron of Lumley, to translate hither the re∣mains and monuments of his ancestors, particularly of John Lumley, and Ralph Lumley, from the yard of the cathedral church at Durham, where they were placed near the north door<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Registr. Modern. Eccles. Dunelm. Mathew, p. 465, d. &amp; ch. lib.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This solemn arrangement of effigies, this aile of death, cannot be visited with∣out some emotion by those who know the family, descended of an illustrious race of ancestry, or have traced their history and possessions. The genealogical table which attends the description of Lumley castle will save a tedious rehearsal of mo∣numental inscriptions.</P>
<P>The first effigy at the foot or west end of the aile, is by an inscription on the wall, noted to appertain to Liulphus, that unhappy minister of Walcher bishop of Durham, who provoked the massacre at Gateshead church: The figure is cut in stone, but much mutilated, having lost the feet; the right hand is extended, grasp∣ing the sword, as in the action of drawing the weapon; the legs are straight. It will be necessary to note why such different attitudes had acceptance in monumen∣tal effigies. Persons who died in battle on the victorious side, were represented with the helmet on the head, the shield on the lest, and the sword on the dexter side, naked, and with the point upwards. Those who died in battle on the van∣quished side, were represented on their tombs without their coat over their armour, with their feet resting on a dead lion, having their hands joined on their breast, the visor lifted up, and the sword in the sheath. Those who died prisoners were re∣presented without helmet, sword or spur. One who had served a great part of his life in the army, and afterwards became a religious person, was represented up∣wards in the habit of the order he professed, and below in complete armour. A gentleman or knight, who had been killed or vanquished in single combat, was re∣presented in compleat armour, his battle ax out of his arms, lying by him, and his left arm across his right. If he had been victorious, he was represented armed on all points, with his right arm across over the left, and his battle ax in his arms. The son of a general, or governor of a castle or fortified city, if he died when the place was besieged, was pourtrayed in complete armour, with his head resting on an helmet instead of a pillow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Barley's Diction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The second effigy, <HI>Utredus filius Liulphi,</HI> cut in stone, his head, shoulders, and arms covered with a coat of mail of chain work, the legs of the same, the right hand grasping the sword hilt in the action of drawing the weapon.</P>
<P>The third, <HI>William de Lumley,</HI> accoutred the same as the last; a parrot held by the tail in the right hand, the legs crossed, the right foot uppermost, the feet rested on a lion couchant—an elegant figure; the folds of the vest skirts easy and finely disposed. This William was the son of Uchtred, and grandson of Liul∣phus before-mentioned.</P>
<P>The fourth, <HI>William Lumley</HI> mil. in a suit of armour, his legs crossed, the left leg uppermost, the feet broken off, his right hand drawing the instrument,
<PB N="393" REF="410"/>
his head rested on an helmet; his hair cut at the fore-top, and in stiff curl.</P>
<P>The fifth, <HI>William de Lumley</HI> mil. son of William, in a suit of armour, his head rested on his helmet, the right hand drawing the sword; the hair like the fourth; the legs straight, and the feet gone.</P>
<P>The sixth, <HI>Roger,</HI> in a suit of armour, much mutilated, the legs, hand and shield gone, hair curled as the former. This personage married Sybil, daugh∣ter and coheiress of Hugh de Morwic, who had two other daughters, Theophania and Beatrix; and they, in the fourth year of king Edward I. made partition of the knights fees of their inheritance.</P>
<P>The seventh, in a suit of armour, a shield, no sword, his right hand on his breast, his hair curled, his head supported on cushions, the legs straight, and feet rest∣ing on a shield of his coat-armour: This tomb belongs to <HI>Robert de Lumley,</HI> eldest son of Roger, and father of Marmaduke, whose tomb is next noted.</P>
<P>The eighth, <HI>Sir Marmaduke de Lumley,</HI> with a curled beard, a cap in up∣right folds and terminating in a point, his head resting on his gauntlets laid across each other, the fingers inwards; his hands elevated on his breast, three parrots scattered on his garments below the girdle; his legs appear to have been placed straight, but are much mutilated: This personage's mother was the eldest daughter of Marmaduke de Thweng, a great baron, lord of Kilton and Thweng, with many other manors in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Westmoreland; she and her sister Catharine were coheiresses of William, Robert, and Thomas de Thweng their brothers: Sir Marmaduke's eldest son, Robert, was under age at his father's death, and he died during his minority, leaving Ralph his next brother and heir: They derived from their mother the manors of Moressome-Magna, Moressome Parva, Ocketon, Lythum, Merske, Brotton, Hylderwell, Skynner∣green, Lyvertoun, North Cave, Rotese-on-the-Wolds, Lound, Langtose, Sway∣thorpe, Thorp juxta Kilton, Foxholes, Thweng, with the advowson of the church, Kilton castle, Stotevil-fee, and Bulmer-fee, all in the county of York<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Esc. 49 king Edw. III. p. 2, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ninth effigy, <HI>Ralph,</HI> first lord of Lumley. This is a remarkable figure, cut in coarse freestone, and was one of those removed from the yard of the cathe∣dral church at Durham, by virtue of the licence before noted: It is dressed in a straight-sleeved jacket or coat of mail, his visor is rib'd down the front, and has two transverse slits for the sight; the breast is covered with the shield bearing three parrots, the sword under the shield unsheathed, the point upwards rested against the face of the visor; the legs are straight, supported on a dog lying at rest. This personage was a knight in the ninth year of king Richard II. and in the retinue of Henry de Percy, earl of Northumberland, in the expedition into Scotland, where he behaved so gallantly, that the king in the year succeeding appointed him governor of Berwick: In the twelfth year of that reign he was taken prisoner by the Scotch: After his release he held Berwick as the earl's deputy for some time: Was sum∣moned to parliament among the barons from the eighth year of king Richard II. till the first of king Henry IV, inclusive, when he was attainted, and had his lands
<PB N="394" REF="411"/>
seized for being a confederate with the earl of Kent and others against that accession, and opposing the disposal of Richard. The associators appeared in arms, and took possession of the town of Cirencester, whilst their troops lay encamped without; but on an insurrection of the inhabitants, the lords were overpowered, and carried prisoners to the king at Oxford, where they suffered immediate execution. It seems lord Lumley was not among the prisoners, for by the record of his for∣feiture and attainder, it is set forth he died in the field of battle: If we give credit to the device on the monument, when he fell he was of the victorious party. His wife Elianor was daughter of John lord Nevill of Raby, and sister of Ralph earl of Westmoreland: In her widowhood, she had in the second year of king Henry IV. an assignment of twenty pounds a year during life out of the customs at Hull, which was confirmed by king Henry V. in the first year of his reign, with the further grant of lands and tenements in Beautrove and Stranton, in the bishopric of Durham, and Holme in Holderness. The eldest son, Thomas, died in the fifth year of king Henry IV. seised of the castle of Lumley Parva, and the manors of Stanley, Stranton, Ricklesden, and Beautrove, in the bishopric, together with divers other large estates in Yorkshire and Northumberland; dying without issue, he left Sir John Lumley, knight, his brother and heir, then twenty years of age. John earl of Somerset had obtained a grant of several manors and estates, which came to the crown under the attainder of Ralph lord Lumley, to the value of three hundred and sixty pounds a year; a great possession in that age <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d tom. viii. p. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The tenth effigy, Sir <HI>John Lumley:</HI> A figure resembling the last described, and most probably the second monument removed from the cathedral church-yard.— To this personage king Henry was much attached; in the sixth year of that reign he had livery of all the castles, manors, and lands of which his father was seised at the time of his attainder; and for his services in Scotland he received the honour of knighthood: He also fought bravely in the French war, for which gal∣lant conduct and fidelity to his sovereign, he had full restitution of blood by par∣liament in the thirteenth year of that reign, as well what was attainted by the con∣viction of his father, as Thomas his brother; so it is expressed in the parliament rolls. In the wars of king Henry V. he also signalized himself: Under the con∣duct of Thomas duke of Clarence, the king's brother, he was in the battle of Baugy, in the province of Anjoy, on Easter-eve, 1421, to which the English army was betrayed by one Andrew Forgusa, a Lombard, who was employed by the duke as a spy, and falsely represented the numbers and situation of the enemy: Many of the English lords were averse to the enterprize, and dissuaded the duke from approaching his foes on so slight and suspicious a report; but the General im∣plicitly placing confidence in his emissary, resolved to seek the foe and engage; his troops disdained the idea of deserting danger, and, when too late, found they were attacking four times their numbers; feats of distinguished bravery were dis∣played, and all the efforts of intrepid courage exhibited, but in vain; for in the dreadful carnage of a defeat, there sell the duke, lord Lumley, the earls of Tankerville and Angus, and the lord Ross, together with many of inferior rank:
<PB N="395" REF="412"/>
He left a son and heir, <HI>Thomas,</HI> whose tomb is not in this arrangement at Chester.</P>
<P>The eleventh effigy, <HI>George lord Lumley:</HI> This figure, like the rest, is re∣cumbent, dressed in robes, a heavy ruff or roll about his neck, his hands elevated, curled hair and beard: The dress similar to the robes of a peer as now worn. This personage was knighted by king Edward IV. He was sheriff of Northumberland in the second and third years of that reign; an office then not only of great trust and authority, but of vast emolument, for no account was made to the king's ex∣chequer till the third year of king Edward VI. but the issues and profits of the bailiwic were appropriated to the sheriffs proper benefit, with all debts, fines, and amerciaments, emoluments accruing from alienations, intrusions, wards, marriages, reliefs, &amp;c. the intention of which appropriation was to reward their diligence in protecting the borders against the Scots, and for that purpose to keep sufficient guards in pay. But that duty being lessened by the appointment of wardens of the marches, in the third year of king Edward VI. it was enacted, that the sheriffs of Northumberland should thenceforth like others account to the exchequer. In the sixth year of king Edward IV. he, with Sir Robert Folbery, were elected knights of the shire for the county of Northumberland, in the parliament summoned to meet at Westminster, and in the return of the writ are stiled <HI>milites gladiis cincti.</HI> He was appointed sheriff of Northumberland in the eighth year of that reign, and continued in office four successive years. In the twentieth year he was in the duke of Gloucester's army, at the taking of Berwick, having a great command in that expedition, and in the rolls of the troops is called lord Lumley: He was one that entered Edinburgh at the head of the forces, and with lord Fitz Hugh, the lord Scrope of Massam, and others, was made a knight banneret in Hooton-field, as a testimony of approved gallantry. On the accession of king Henry VII. he attend∣ed the king in his northern progress. In the thirteenth year of king Henry VII. he served in lord Surrey's army, when they raised the siege of Norham castle, where the king of Scots lay in person; and from thence penetrating into Scotland, made a diversion, and destroyed some considerable fortresses in sight of the Scotch army. On the espousals of the princess Margaret of England with James king of Scotland, 1502, he, with his son and their retinue, accompanied by eighty horsemen in their train, apparelled in the family liveries, met the queen at Darlington and at∣tended her to Berwick. He married one of the daughters of Roger Thornton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> a merchant at Newcastle, by whom he got a large fortune, and among other pos∣sessions the manors of Witton in Northumberland, Ludworth and the Isle, in this county. There happened much litigation touching this lady's fortune, through one Giles Thornton, a natural son of her father; and the contention becoming personal, lord Lumley slew him at Windsor castle ditch. Bishop Sherwood, in the sixth year of his pontificacy, granted a pardon to George lord Lumley, of all fe∣lonies, and restoration of forfeitures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cursitors Rolls.—<BIBL>Rudd's MSS.</BIBL></NOTE>. His eldest son and heir apparent died in his life time, to whom the following monument was erected.</P>
<P>The twelfth effigy, Sir <HI>Thomas Lumley:</HI> This figure is in a suit of armour, his hair curled, and head resting on a helmet, the hands elevated, and legs extended: Quarters the royal arms with a bar, having married Elizabeth Plantagenet, a natural

daughter of king Edward IV. by lady Elizabeth Lucy. He appeared on behalf of the clergy and commonalty of the diocese of Durham, in the eleventh year of king Henry VII. when the three estates of the kingdom were summoned to assemble at Westminster on the 27th of October, 1495. He left four sons, Richard, John, George, and Roger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From him the <HI>Lambtons, Conyers,</HI> and <HI>Trollops,</HI> of this county, are descended.</NOTE>; the eldest became heir to George lord Lumley, the grand∣father: He also left three daughters, Ann married Ralph lord Ogle, of Bothal; Sibil, who married William baron Hilton of Hilton, in this county; and Elianor, who married — Creswell, of Creswell, in Northumberland.</P>

<P>The thirteenth effigy, <HI>Richard lord Lumley,</HI> in robes, with elevated hands, a ruff or roll about the neck. This personage was the eldest son of Thomas Lumley, as before mentioned, and had summons to parliament among the barons, in the first year of king Henry VIII. He left by Anne his lady, daughter of Sir John Conyers, of Hornby castle, his eldest son John, who succeeded to the family ho∣nours and estates.</P>
<P>The fourteenth and last effigy, <HI>John lord Lumley.</HI> The figure dressed in robes. This personage, in the fifth year of king Henry VIII. on the Scotch invasion, joined the earl of Surrey with a large force, and was one of the principal commanders of the van guard of the English army at the battle of Flodden Field: It is mentioned by several historians, that this van guard shewed great bravery in the engagement, and were victorious over that body of the enemy commanded by the earls of Crawford and Montross, who both fell in the field. In the following year he was summoned to parliament, and in the year 1520, he was present at the interview the king had with the emperor Charles V. at Canterbury, and that with the king of France near Ardres: He served under the earl of Shrewsbury in the Scotch expe∣ditions; and in the twenty-first of the reign, had summons to that parliament which existed five years by prorogations, and struck the first blow in the dissolution of religious houses: He was in the combination that encouraged the king to the divorce of queen Catharine; and at last fell from his loyalty, and joined the nor∣thern confederates in the pilgrimage of grace, but accepted the terms of the duke of Norfolk's proclamation. His son George fell into other broils, and was one of the partizans of the lord Darcy, was apprehended and committed to the Tower, and soon after suffered death. John the son of George Lumley, at the death of his grandfather, was an infant under age; and in the first year of king Edward VI. on his petition was restored in blood, as son and heir of George, and cousin and heir of John, then late lord Lumley, but sundry parts of the estate were severed from the family, the act of restoration not repealing the attainder of his father.</P>
<P>Another monument of one of the ancestors of this family is noted to us by Mr Grose, which he says he found in an old book of pedigrees in the British Museum; as it is not one in the arrangement before mentioned in remembrance thereof we have given a cut of it. We conceive that this is the monument of Thomas the son and
<PB N="397" REF="414"/>
heir of Sir John Lumley, whose effigy is the tenth in the arrangement, and had been removed from its station in Chester church, for some cause not noted there.</P>

<P>The deanry house, the seat of the ancient family of Hedworths, is in a pleasant situation, commanding a fine view of Lumley castle and the adjacent grounds, and is surrounded with excellent meadow grounds <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The manor of Chester deanry is a copyhold manor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="415"/>Gunceastre, or Goncaceastre, was the ancient Saxon name of this place, and as Leland says, was derived from the rivulet Cone, which there empties itself into Were. In the Itinerary, vol. i. p. 83, it is said, <Q>There is no bridge memorable on Were beneath Duresme but Chester bridge. Were cummith within a quarter of a mile of the town self of Chester. From Duresme, over Framagate bridge to Chester in the Streate, partly by a little corne ground, but most by montainiouse pasture and some mores and firres. Or I came in Chester I saw scant half a mile of it, Lomeley castel upon a hill, having praty wood about it, and about Chester self is likewise sum woode. The toune of Chester is chiefly one streate, of very meane building in height. Ther is beside a smaul streate or 2 about the chirch collegiate, that hath a dean and prebendaries, but it is a very meane building; and in the body of the chirch is a tumbe, with the image of a byshop, yn token that St Cuthbert ons was buried or remained in his feretre there. At the very ende of the toune I passid over Cone brooke, and there is a fair stone bridge of 3 arches over it. Thens to Gateshed vii miles by montainiouse ground, with pasture, heth, more, and firres; and a litle a this side Gatehead is a great cole pit.</Q></P>
<P>The present town of Chester is about a mile in length, consisting chiefly of one long street, has many good buildings in it, and is commodiously situated for sup∣plying the numerous miners employed in the neighbouring collieries and other works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At Whitehill, or Whitwel, in this neighbourhood, is a blast furnace, which makes iron metal from iron stone dug out of pits in the neighbouring fells. These fells have been very much worked for iron stone (sup∣posed by the Danes, when they were in possession of this kingdom) as appears from the great quantity of scoria or cinder which is found upon the fells and extends many miles westward. The method in those times had been to melt the iron stone with charcoal in a large smithy hearth, called a bloomery, and then in another hearth to melt it down again and reduce it to bar iron for all manner of country uses: And when the wood failed they removed their hearths to where was more plenty, so that evidently they must have blown their bloomery bellows either by hand or with horses, or have known the use of air furnaces, as the most scoria or cinder is found upon the high grounds, where no water could be obtained. About three miles west of Chester is a place called the Old Furnace, where very lately was to be seen the bottom of a furnace hearth, according to the usual method of building them now, but of much smaller dimensions: They had blown the bellows with a water wheel, as appears by the cut of a water race to convey it to the wheel from an upper part of the burne. On the opposite side of the burne is a place called the Allum Well, from the water having a strong aluminous smell and taste. The method of making metal is by putting into a large furnace about thirty-four feet in height, and twelve or thirteen feet wide in the broadest part, but contracted at top and bottom, a certain number of baskets of coal or cinders, to a certain number of boxes of iron stone, calcined for the purpose, and a quantity of lime stone sufficient to slux it; when a sufficient quantity is melt∣ed into the hearth or bason at the bottom of the furnace, it then is tapped with an iron bar, and run off into metal pigs, or large vessels prepared in loam, (a composition of sand, clay, &amp;c.) for different uses, such as brewing vessels, soap pans, engine pumps, cylinders, cannons of all sizes,; and the iron stone and coal used here, are allowed by the best judges at his majesty's warren at Woolwich, to make the strongest and soundest cannons that are proved there.—<HI>From the information of Mr Smith, agent to these works.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>

<ITEM>The Family of LUMLEY is undoubtedly of great Antiquity; and various are the Traditions, touching the original Stem thereof; which, like most others of such long standing, is so ingulphed in Obscurity, that no other Light than Conjecture is now to be had thereof: the most probable (besides the authority of so great men as Camden and Sir William Dugdale) is, that this Family is denominated from LUMLEY on the Banks of the River Wear, near Chester-le-Street, in the county Durham, where being seated, they were thence surnamed, as the manner of those ages was, to stile men from the places where they lived or were born, and by the best Records, &amp;c. are said to be descended from</ITEM>

The chief improvement of this country is attributed to cardinal Langley, who dis∣forested the lands, and licenced their being inclosed and brought into tillage.</P>
<P>As this manor appertained to the bishop, we must naturally conclude there were few free tenants therein: In the fifth year of bishop Hatfield, Will. de Birtley died seised of a messuage and thirty acres of land here, held by homage, fealty, and fif∣teen shillings rent; and Ra. Clerk, in the seventh year of the same prelate, died seised of twenty-six acres of land, held by fealty and ten shillings rent, and sixty acres of wood, by fealty and rendering two arrows; and they are the only free tenants we have met with noted in the ancient records.</P>
<P>Camden apprehended Chester was the <HI>Condercum</HI> of the Romans: Dr Stukeley, in his Iter-boreale, 1725, says, <Q>The Hermen street is very plain, being a straight line hither when we descend from Gateshead fell: I think Bede mentions this station, as called Concester, which retains part of the Roman name. Great coal works too hereabouts. The first wing of the Astures made this their garrison, as the Notitia tells us, being <HI>ad lineam valli;</HI> for though it be not upon the wall, it is reasonable to think his expression is not to be strictly taken; it was convenient that some of the forces that guarded the wall should be quartered at some suit∣able distance, that they might have room of country for their maintenance.</Q> No inscriptions or other Roman remains have been discovered here; and the name of Chester-on-the-Street derived from its situation on the Roman way, has hither∣to been all that led the antiquaries to conceive it was of Roman origin. It is pro∣bable, as Dr Stukeley observes, some troops were stationed at a distance from the wall; perhaps they lined the great roads at intervals with small detachments; and this is still more probable, if we admit they knew any thing of pit coal for fuel. But we defer speaking on that till we advance to the banks of Tyne.</P>

<HEAD>LUMLEY CASTLE</HEAD>
<P>is the next place of observation. This castle, one of the seats of lord Scar∣borough, stands on a fine elevated situation, ornamented with beautiful planta∣tions; the lands rise gradually from the channel of the river Were on the south and west sides; and on the north is the rivulet called Lumley beck: The east front of the castle stands immediately on the brink of a very deep valley, full of wood, through which the brook winds towards the Were. The form of this edifice is square, having a projecting tower at each angle, and a court or area in the center: The corners of each tower are guarded with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tresses, crowned with a small turret or observatory; what is singular in the turrets is, that they are oc∣tangular, so that they overhang the face of each square of the base, and are machi∣colated or open for the purpose of annoying assailants by casting down stones, &amp;c. which gives the edifice a singular appearance: The castle is built of a yellow free-stone, which makes it look bright and beautiful at a distance. The chief entrance is at the west front, by a double slight of steps, and a platform, which fills the whole space between the tower; the south front is modern, and brought forward almost parallel with the tower, sixty-five paces in length; the north front is ob∣scured

by offices; and the east front retains its ancient form: There is a gateway in the center of the east front, which projects and is guarded by square turrets at the angles, with observatories as before described; above the gate is a gallery formed in the arch, with apertures to annoy an enemy: Above this gate are six shields of arms boldly cut in stone, with their several crests, cotemporary with the building, and which critically give us the date of it.</P>
<P>The arrangement of the arms is as follows: In the center, and elevated above the rest, are the arms of France and England quarterly, being, as we presume, the arms of king Richard II. as in that reign Sir Ralph Lumley obtained licence from bishop Skirlaw, dated 1389, to castellate his house of Lumley; and the architec∣ture of this front is a grand model of the taste of that age: The act of Richard II. mentioned by Mr Pennant, had been intrusional or merely confirmatory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>It is said to have been built in the time of Edward I. by Sir Robert de Lumley, and enlarged by his son Sir Marmaduke.

The former was not properly castellated till the year 1392, when Sir Ralph, the first lord of Lum∣ley, obtained from Richard II. <HI>Licentiam castrum suum de Lomley, do novo aedificandum, muro de petra &amp; calce batellare &amp; kernellare et castrum illud sic batellatum &amp; kernellatum tenere, &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

There are three stories of apartments in this front, with mullioned windows guarded with iron: Between the walls and the brink of the precipice, is just space enough for a terrace, which in early times was guarded with a curtain wall: The dell is very deep, the banks are steep, and now filled with large forest trees: The uniformity of the east front, the arrangement of the arms, and the whole appearance of the masonry, testify that this was part of the original structure, and a chief entrance; for should we form our conjecture from the appearance of the center area, we should conclude every front of the castle was similar to this.</P>
<P>Many accounts and prints have been published of this beautiful place, which strikes the eye of the traveller on the great northern road; the most excellent of the prints was by Hearne and Byrne: We will in the first place select from the various publications such matter as appears most worthy attention, and then pro∣ceed with our view. All that Camden says of it is, <Q>that it is enclosed with a park.</Q> In Russell and Owen's England Displayed, it is described to contain
<PB N="401" REF="422"/>
<Q>a great number of spacious apartments, some antique and others modern: The paintings are valuable, many of them representing the ancestors of that noble family, for some centuries past, in the habits of the time. The park, besides the pleasantness of the situation, has another and still more valuable circum∣stance to recommend it, that of being full of veins of coal; this, together with a navigable river, by which the coals are carried down to Sunderland, render Lumley park an inexhaustable mine of treasure to the family.</Q> In one of the monthly magazines we are informed by a paper signed Edward Barras, <Q>that the park is walled round with hewn stone, had formerly deer, but after it was re∣duced and the pales removed, they sickened and died." And he adds, "there are several dates upon different parts of the castle; one was pointed out to me, on the inner side of one of the eastern turrets, where the letters I. L. 1550 appear, though almost defaced.</Q> Much repair has been given to the inner walls of the area; and on one of the eastern towers are two long strings of es∣cutcheons cut in stone, and placed in the building, nine in each row, with the arms of Lumley in the center at the bottom, and in two small shields at the top, a fleur∣de-lis on the dexter side, and a rose on the sinister: In those strings the Lumley arms are impaled, with the several families wherewith they intermarried.</P>
<P>There is a tradition at Chester, that about a century ago, the remains of an old chapel stood about three hundred yards to the north-west of the castle, with several vaults and subterraneous passages: A hill called Chapel hill, is well known, but no one about the castle could give any information touching the buildings.</P>
<P>From the platform at the entrance into the hall you command a beautiful pros∣pect. At the foot of the avenue which leads up to the castle, is a fine bason of water, with a salmon lock, and fishermen's cottage; over which, on the opposite rising grounds, you view the town of Chester, the deanry house, and church, at a pleasing distance: The more extended landscape comprehends the great northern road, animated with passengers, the house of <HI>Flalts,</HI> (formerly belonging to the Allans <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

Sir Thomas Lumley, who married Margaret, daughter of Sir James Harrington: He received knighthood as a reward for his military prowess, and was employed by government in several momentous negociations: In the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirty-first years of king Henry VI. was guarrantee for the king of England in the Scotch treaties: In the thirty-third year of that reign was made governor of Scarborough castle for life; a most distinguished trust: Was entrusted in many other appointments of government. It appears he was equally a favourite with king Edward IV. for in the first year of that reign he obtained a re∣versal of his grandfather's attainder; had summons to parliament for the remainder of his life, and was employed in various confidential matters by his sovereign, par∣ticularly in the negociations with king James of Scotland, touching his marriage. 12. George lord Lumley, who married Elizabeth Thornton. 13. Sir Thomas Lumley, who married Elizabeth, natural daughter of king Edward IV. 14. John de Lumley, who married Joan, daughter of Henry lord Scrope. 15. Richard de Lumley, who married Ann, daughter of Sir John Conyers. 16. George Lumley, who married Jane, daughter of Sir Richard Knightley. 17. Elizabeth, daughter of John lord Darcy of Chiche, and second wife of Sir John Lumley, who was restored in blood the first of king Edward VI. and had the ancient barony revived.</P>
<P>The great dining-room is in the south-west tower, elegantly stuccoed, with a vaulted roof; on one side it commands a view of the adjacent meadows, the sloping banks of the river Were, highly cultivated; with a fine canal, formed by a curva∣ture of the stream: at the end windows, a prospect down the avenue, with Chester and the chief objects described from the platform.</P>
<P>The little dining-room has several fine portraits. John lord Lumley, 1563, a three quarter piece; a pleasing picture: There are other two portraits of this personage in the music-room, one dated 1588, the other 1591. This John was the son and heir of George Lumley, who suffered death as before mentioned, and grandson and heir of John lord Lumley. In the sixth year of king Edward VI. he was restored in blood, and that he and the heirs male of his body should hold and bear the name, dignity, state, and pre-eminence of a baron of this realm, &amp;c. On the 29th of September, 1553, he was made one of the knights of the bath, and attended with his lady at the coronation of queen Mary, he among the barons, and she one of the six ladies who sat in the chariot of state, dressed in crimson velvet, &amp;c. He was one of the two lords who introduced the first Russian ambassador to audience: Was in employ in the first years of queen Elizabeth, but being suspected of intrigue in the affairs of the queen of Scots, was taken into custody with his father-in-law, the carl of Arundel, in the twelfth year of that reign, and was a great favourite with
<PB N="404" REF="425"/>
the earl, as appears by his will. He afterwards came into great confidence with the queen, and was one of the lords commissioned to sit in trial of the unhappy victim of Elizabeth's jealousies, and with a firmness some historians have spoken of with expressions of surprize, delivered his opinion <HI>that the sentence was justly pronounced against the queen of Scots.</HI> In the forty-fourth year of the queen he was one of the peers who sat on the trial of Robert D'Evereux, earl of Essex. On the accession of king James he experienced many testimonies of royal confidence: Camden made most honourable mention of him: <Q>He was a person of entire vir∣tue, integrity, and innocence; and in his old age a complete pattern of true no∣bility. He had so great a veneration for the memory of his ancestors, that he caused monuments to be erected for them in the collegiate church of Chester in the Street, in order as they succeeded one another, from Liulphus down to his own time, which he had either picked out of the demolished monasteries or made new.</Q> By his will he devised his estates, particularly the castle and manor of Lumley, to Richard Lumley, eldest son and heir apparent of Roger Lumley, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> son of Anthony, brother to John lord Lumley his grandfather. He married Jane, the eldest of the two daughters of Henry Fitz-Allan, earl of Arundel, and by her had three children, who died in infancy; and to his second wife married Elizabeth, daughter of John lord Darcy of Chiche, who survived him, and by whom he had no issue: He died on the 11th of April, 1609, and was buried in the church at Cheam. The ancient barony of Lumley expired at his death.</P>

<P>The last <HI>earl of Arundel,</HI> a three quarter piece: His valour distinguished him in the reign of king Henry VIII. when he ran with his squadron close under the walls of Bulogne, and soon reduced it. In the following reign he opposed the misused powers of the unhappy protector, Somerset, and yet declined connection with the great Northumberland. He supported the just rights of queen Mary; was imprisoned by the former, but on the Revolution was employed to arrest the abject fallen duke: He was closely attached to his royal mistress by principles of religion: In his declining years he aimed at being husband to queen Elizabeth. Had her ma∣jesty deigned to put herself under the power of man, she never would have given the preference to age.

He is represented as a very handsome man, bald, in a close black gown, with both hands on a great sword, on whose hilt is inscribed the word <HI>Azot.</HI> This was the name of his familiar spirit, that he kept imprisoned in the pummel, to consult on emergent occasions.

<P>Doctor Stukeley, in his Iter Boreale, in 1725, before mentioned, says, <Q>At Lumley castle is a curious old picture of Chaucer, said to be an original.</Q> We could not find any such portrait, neither is it mentioned by Mr Pennant.</P>
<P>There is a wooden equestrian statue of Liulphus in the house, with his battle-ax in his hand. Mr Pennant tells the following story: <Q>When king James I. in one of his progresses was entertained in this castle, William James, bishop of Dur∣ham, a relation of the house, in order to give his majesty an idea of the im∣portance of the family, wearied him with a long detail of their ancestry, to a period even beyond belief, <HI>O mon,</HI> says the king, <HI>gang na farther, let me digest the knawledge I ha gained; for, by my saul, I did na ken Adam's name was Lumley</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Grant al.

<P>The foot walk to Lumley castle from Chester, leads through fine meadows, and by the fish lock: They take about six hundred salmon here in a season.</P>
<P>We must not depart from this beautiful place, without remarking, that on failure of issue in John lord Lumley, Dr Lloyd was competitor with Richard earl of Scarborough, for the barony, which was determined in 1723, in favour of the earl.</P>
<P>GREAT LUMLEY has nothing remarkable but the ruins of an old hall. There was a partition of the Lumley estates in the time of king Henry III. to three co∣heiresses, which might occasion the following circumstances: In the first year of bishop Booth, Margaret, the wife of Christopher Moresby, died seised of a moiety of the wasted manors of East Hall and West Hall, in Great Lumley, consisting of 100 acr. of tillage land, 30 acr. of wood, and 30 acr. of moor, with a moiety of a fishery in the river Were, held of the bishop <HI>in capite,</HI> by half a knight's fee, leaving Ch. Moresby her son and heir, an infant; and we hear no more of that family there from that period, so that it is probable his moiety reverted to the Lumleys.
<PB N="409" REF="430"/>
Thomas Lumley's daughter Elizabeth, married William Tyllyoll; and in the fourth year of bishop Dudley, by an inquisition taken on the death of the same William Tyllyoll de Lumley Magna, arm. it appears he died seised of a moiety of Great Lumley, leaving Phillis, the wife of William Musgrave, and Margaret Tyllyoll, his daughters by his wife Elizabeth, coheiresses.</P>

<P>PELAWE gave name to a resident family, and in the time of bishop Bury, one John de Birteley held lands there of Richard de Pelawe <HI>in capite,</HI> by twelve-pence rent and suit of court, and a quarter of beans yearly to the rector of Boldon for the time being<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Unum quart'ium fabarum.</NOTE>.

<P><PB REF="439"/><HI>The Genealogical Table is illustrated, and great Additions made thereto, by the following Historical Notes, taken from <HI>Mr. GYLL'S MSS.</HI> who, in the first part of the Collection, remarks, that he took the same and others, from a Manuscript written in the Reign of King Charles I.</HI></P>
<P>In an old manuscript which I have seen of the descent of Connyers of Sockbourn, there is written as follow: <Q>Sir John Connyers, Knt. slew the monstrous vermine, and poysonous vermine, or wyverne, or aske or worm, which overthrew and devoured many and sundry people in feight, for that the sent of the poyson thereof was so strong, that no personne might abide it. And by the providence of Almighty God, this John Connyers, Knt. overthrew the said monster, and slew it. But before he made this enterprise, having but one son, he went to the church at Sockburn in compleat armour, and offered up that, his only son, to the Holy Ghost: the place where this great serpent lay, was called Graystane.</Q> And as it is written in the same manuscript, this John lieth buried in Sockbourn, in compleat armour, before the conquest.</P>
<P><HI>Roger Connyers or Cognyers,</HI> was Lord of Sockbourn about the time of the Norman conquest, which was An. Dom. 1060.—He was, by William the Conqueror, made constable of Durham Castle, and keeper of all the arms of the soldiers within that castle; which was after past to him, the said Roger, by deed to him and his heirs male for ever, and under the great seal of William de Sancto Carelipho, the then Bishop of Durham.—This Roger had issue Roger, his son and heir, and others.</P>
<P><HI>Roger Connyers or Cognyers,</HI> Lord of Sockbourn, son and heir of Roger the first, was also, after his father, constable of Durham castle, and of all the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms therein; and he had issue Roger, his son and heir, and others.</P>
<P><HI>Roger Connyers,</HI> the third of that name, son and heir of Roger the second, and grandchild to Roger the first, constable of Durham, and lord of Sockbourn, was also himself constable of Durham: this Roger he married the daughter of ...... Aiskby, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and had issue Robert and others.—Et Henricus 2d rex Angliae dedit vel confirmarit Rogero de Connyers sive de Cognyers constabulatum de Dunelme.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Connyers,</HI> Lord of Sockbourn, son and heir of Roger the third, of the christian name; he married the daughter of Robert Welbury, of Castle Eden, and had Robert and others.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Connyers,</HI> son and heir of Roger, and grandchild of Roger, the third of the name, was Lord of Sockbourn, and married the daughter of Layton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and by her had Roger, Galfred, John, and others.—This Galfred, second son of Robert, afterwards had the estate, and was Lord of Sockbourn, either by gift or purchase.</P>
<P><HI>Roger Connyers,</HI> son and heir of Robert, the second of the name and family, was Lord of Sockbourn, and married the daughter of Sir Gilbert Han∣sard, Knt. and had issue Robert, the 3d of the christian name and family; he married the daughter ...... and died without issue — Robertus filius et heres Rogeri qui hereditatem suam alienavit Galfrido consanguineo suo et obijt fine prole.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Connyers</HI> of Sockbourn, was lord thereof; he was son and heir of Roger, son of Robert, the second of that christian name and family; he mar. ...... the daughter of ...... Umfravill, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and died without any issue.—Robertus filius et heres Rogeri: qui hereditatem suam alienavit Galfrido consanguineo suo et obiit sine prole.</P>
<P><HI>Galfred Connyers,</HI> second son of Robert Connyers, the second of that christian name, was lord and the owner of Sockbourn, after the death of Robert Connyers, the son and heir of Roger, who died without issue; and the descent of Connyers, in an old manuscript, sets down, that this Galfred bought the lordship of Sockbourn of his cousin Robert, the son of Roger, who died without issue, and so possessed the lordship of Sockbourn, and was lord and owner thereof; and so it seems, as by an antient deed, that Connyers of Sockbourn, was not the chief man of the family.—This Galfred married the daughter of Lilbourn, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and had issue John, Thomas, and James.</P>
<P><HI>John Connyers,</HI> son and heir of Galfred, was, after his father, Lord of Sockbourn: he married ...... the daughter of Sir Walter Manning, Knt. and had issue John, Galfred, and Humphrey; John and Galfred, the two eldest brothers, both died without issue, so as Humphrey, the youngest son of John, after the death of the two elder brothers, John and Galfred, was lord and owner of Sockbourn, and that whole estate; and in an old descent of the family which I have, he is set down primus miles, istis familiae.</P>

<HEAD>RAVENSWORTH CASTLE,</HEAD>
<P>the seat of the family of Liddells, now of Sir Henry George Liddell, bart. stands on the side of a hill, sloping gradually towards the east; a situation not chosen for strength. Near to it, by the road side, is a stone column, but of what event it is a memorial, history or tradition give no account. The antiquity of this castle leads to conjectures as to the etymology of the name; in many old records it is called <HI>Ravens-helm</HI> and <HI>Ravenswaith,</HI> in the old spelling <HI>Raffensweath.</HI> The Danish standard was called <HI>Raffen,</HI> and <HI>weath</HI> is a north country word, now used in Scotland for <HI>sorrow.</HI> "I should be very <HI>weath</HI> to do such an act," is a phrase very commonly used in this country. The application we would make is, that Ravensworth castle is of Danish foundation, and had its name from them as Raffens-Helm, or the strong hold of the Danish standard; and that some de∣feat of that people had occasioned the name of Raffens-weath, or Danish woe. All etymologies, where there is such a mixture of languages as in this country, will be subject to much uncertainty, and we offer this only as a vague conjecture. This castle has anciently formed a complete square, with a tower at each corner, con∣nected with a curtain wall: Whether there was any keep or other structure in the center, it is not possible to determine; two of the towers form part of the offices to the present mansion, the other two project to the front. The apartments are small, but neat, without much ornament; the breakfast room and room above it are modern, and face the south, with a bow window; the lower one stuccoed; the upper room elegantly fitted up, and hung with tapestry of Antwerp; at one end of the room the landscape work is strikingly beautiful, in the stile of Pousin: There is a spacious saloon, stair-case, and a good dining-room. The castle is shut in to the north and west by a fine forest of oaks, the nursery of a large breed of herons, and some pheasants: The south aspect consists of rich meadow lands, scattered over with large trees at irregular distances: To the east the vale of Lamesley, beautifully cloathed with wood, is extended to the eye for a mile and a half; immediately opposite, at the greatest distance, Gateshead-fell, wild and shaken, with a multitude of hovels and cottages.</P>
<P>Soon after bishop Flambard came to the See, he granted to Richard his nephew, and his heirs, to hold in fee by homage and the service of half a knight's see,

Ravensworth castle was a fortress before any records now extant; as there is no licence to embattle and kernellate this house found in the bishop's archives, though of every other castle in the county there is that evidence. It is presumed, that according to the fashion of the times, the owner of Ravensworth assumed a local name: In the twelfth year of bishop Hatfield, we find Tho.

<P>Of LAMESLEY there is little distinct from Ravenshelm in the records: The Stutvills and Eures held portions of land there of the Lumleys, but of little con∣sideration in the whole. In the inquisition taken on the death of Thomas Lumley, in the sixteenth year of bishop Booth, this manor, of which he died seised, is de∣scribed to consist of sixty acres of arable land, fifty acres of pasture, ten acres of meadow, and forty acres of wood; and Eighton is described as parcel of the manor. This vale exhibits a new scene for description; busy and black faces, machines loaden with coals rolling on frames, engines, and smoaking furnaces, perpetual agitation, traffic, and business: But of these matters we shall speak at large hereafter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>O'ib's videntib's et audientib's literas istas t'm futuris q'm p'sentib's Rob'tus filius Ric'i de Ravenswich sal'm Sciatis me concessisse &amp; in p'rpetuum quiete clamasse Galfrido fil.

<P>FARNACRES is not noticed in the assignment of the prebends, and probably at that time was included in the description of Lamesley or Ravenshelm: In some of the records it is called of the parish of Whickham. It gave name to the resident family in the beginning of bishop Hatfield's episcopacy; but when his survey was taken, Robert Umfrevill held the manor by homage, fealty, and the fourth part of a knight's fee, as also appears by an inquisition taken on his death, in the thirty-fifth year of that prelate, then valued at ten pounds. This family fell into female issue in the time of bishop Langley, as is before noted in Holmside, in the parish of Lanchester. In 1428, Robert Umfrevill obtained licence to found a chantry in the chapel of Farnacres within that manor, which he endowed with the manor; after which, in 1439, the hospital of Frereside was annexed thereto: After the dissolution, Farnacres was annexed by purchase to the Ravensworth estate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Farneacres.</HI></P>

<HI>Cawsey,</HI> or as it is called in the old records <HI>Caldsit,</HI> is situated a little distance from Tanfield: This estate has for some considerable time appertained to the family of Claverings. The Dawsons had property and a mansion-house at Tanfield, now an∣nexed to the Beamish estate. Beamish continued in the family of Monbouchers for several generations; and in the time of bishop Nevill, Elizabeth, baroness of Hilton, formerly the wife of Bertram Monboucher, died possessed of Beamish and Tanfield, which she held for life. In the fifth year of bishop Booth, Bertram Har∣botell died seised <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. cor. Joh. Athirton, arm. esc.</NOTE> of the manors of Beamish and Tanfield, in the latter of which Caweset, Le-Croke, and Le-Leigh are described as members. The manor of Beamish is therein set out to consist of one hundred and sixty acres of land, and forty acres of wood. The Hilton name became extinct in female issue, Dorothy, one of the coheiresses, marrying Morton Davison of Beamish, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> The Davisons also failed in male issue, and the large possessions of that family are come to Sir John Eden, baronet, whose mother was the surviving sister of Morton Davison, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> eldest son of the before named Morton.</P>
<P>BEAMISH-HOUSE is situate in a wooded vale, on the banks of the river Team, and in a deep retirement; the adjacent lands are fertile and well sheltered, but the hills which surround it barren and lofty; yet nature has amply recompensed all outward deformities, by her riches in mines of coal and iron.</P>
<P>Near Tanfield is a great work called <HI>Cawsy-Bridge,</HI> carried over a deep gill or valley, to obtain a level for the coal waggons to pass, constructed at the expence of the Grand Associators in colliery works in this country, known by the local appellation of the Grand Allies: The span of the arch is one hundred and two feet, which rises in abutments or land piers about nine feet in height, and being semi∣circular, makes the elevation about sixty feet; the level is from thence kept up by forced bankings of earth, in some parts forty feet in height, and one hundred and forty paces in length; much more expensive than mason-work: There is a drift cut through the solid rock, to convey the stream of the rivulet under the bankings. The valley is wooded, wild, and romantic.</P>

<P>We must not quit this tract without observing, that traces of a Roman way have frequently been discovered on the moor north of Urpeth, in a direction lead∣ing from the north to Chester: Within a mile of Urpeth is a round hill, with a trench, one of those temporary fortifications used on the incursion of the Scots, when they came down in small bands to pillage the country: Such are numerous all over the borders. At Lawsome hill is a most extensive prospect, commanding the Chiviots to the north, Cleveland hills south, Newcastle towards the east, with Lumley castle, Chester, and Durham cathedral on the nearer grounds, the towns of Tanfield and Shield-row, with the mountains at the head of Weredale, on the most distant ground, to the west. The rivulet of Team may truly be called a mechanic stream, as there are not in the north any works to be compared to those its waters supply: It carries ten mills or more, for the working of iron by Crowley's people, making oil, fulling, and grinding corn. Although mining and trade ex∣ercise the attention of so many inhabitants, yet agriculture and country occupations are not neglected: The farmers have introduced an improved breed of sheep, by crossing with the Lincolnshire sort, and feed mutton to twenty-five pounds a quarter; the fell sheep are small and degenerated by want of change: The fell-bred cattle are about twenty-five stone weight at the slaughter; the better breed come to about sixty stone weight: Such are the stocks on the estates adjoining the moors; in the lower lands by the banks of the river, the breeds of cattle are much superior. There are iron mines near Tanfield, which appear to have been wrought in very distant times: The metal lies at a very inconsiderable depth from the surface. If the use of coal be so important as a late pretended discovery seemed to promise, these mines from their situation may hereafter prove of very great importance.</P>

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>MUGGLESWICK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Adjoining to Lanchester parish, on the west, lies the parish of Muggleswick. The first mention made of this place is in the time of bishop Pudsey, who granted it to the convent of Durham, in exchange for Hardwick: And in the middle of the thirteenth century, Hugh, prior of Durham, inclosed a park here, and built a ca∣mera, consisting of a hall, chapel, and lodgings: The remains of those structures yet appear, part of the park wall and the east end of the chapel; the whole camera has had underground apartments for securing cattle during the incursions of the Scots. Bishop Bainbrigg granted to the convent a confirmatory charter of Muggleswick, and also of two hundred and sixteen acres of wood and waste lands in the vill of Horseleyhope, given to them by bishop Kirkham, with licence to in∣close and empark the same, accompanied with an inspeximus of his predecessors several grants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bainbrigg Rot. B. N<SUP>o</SUP> 66.—<BIBL>Ibid. Rot. N<SUP>o</SUP> 64. 28 Sep. 1508.</BIBL></NOTE>. The etymology of the name of Muggleswick is very doubtful; it seems to have derivation from the Scotch word <HI>mickle,</HI> and might imply a large village in former times, though now an insignificant little place. The church is a mean edifice; the nave thirty-seven feet in length and twenty-one in width; and the chancel eighteen feet long and fifteen wide: The park was originally about three miles long and two broad; much of it is now in tillage and divided into farms<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Muggleswick curacy.</HI> Prior of Durham prop.—Dean and chapter Durham patrons.</P>

<P>This informant saith, That he hath known divers seditious meetings in Muggleswick park, within these last six months, sometimes at the house of one John Ward, who is one of their chief preachers, sometimes at the house of John Readshaw, Robert Blenkinsop, and Rowland Harrison, who were met together. The said John Ward, John Readshaw, Robert Blenkinsop, and Rowland Harrison, together with Capt. Dossen, Capt. George Gower, Robert Readshaw, son of the said John, Robert Taylor, Mark Taylor, both of Ecles bridge, John March, of the same, John Joplin, of the Fox-holes, John March, of Ridley mill, Cuthbert Newton, of Hendsey, Richard Taylor, of Crankley, Henry Angas, Cuthbert Maugham, of Birchenfields, George Read∣shaw, of Edmondbyers, John Oliver, of the same, Lewis Frost, of South-Sheales, Cuthbert Coatsworth and Michael Coatsworth, of the same, Richard Ord and John Ord, of Birchenhaugh, James Carr, of Ardley, Rob. Dalmer, of Crowcroke, Rowland and Nicholas Harrison, sons of Rowland Harrison abovesaid, John Hopper, of Carp-Sheals, Thomas Readshaw, of Paddomsack, Michael Ward, of Shotley-field, Cuthbert Ward, of Black-Hedley, Ralph Iley, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmundbyers, Richard Johnson, of Sunderland, and Foster, of the same; where they did mutually take an oath of secrecy not to discover their design, which was to rise in rebellion against the present government, and to destroy the present parliament, which had made a law against liberty of con∣science, and to murder all bishops, deans and chapters, and all ministers of the church, and to break all or∣gans in pieces, to destroy the common prayer-books and to pull down all churches, and farther to kill the gen∣try that should either opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, or not join with them in their design; that they intended first to fall upon Durham, to seize any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine that might be there, or money in any treasurer's hands, and to plunder the town. They did boast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any thousands of Anabaptists and Independents that were to join with them in the nation, with whom they had daily correspondence by letters and messengers, upon which employment the said informant hath been divers times sent to divers persons; and he heard them lately say, that some Papists were lately come into their party, and they did not doubt of their real intention to join with them in their design; that they have already in their hands some provision of arms, and do expect great proportion both of arms and ammunition from Lewis Frost abovesaid, who hath undertaken to provide for them. And he further saith, that for divers months by past it was resolved amongst them, to rise on the 25th of this instant March, but they did lately agree to defer the execution of their design for a month longer, till they see what the par∣liament would do concerning indulgence to tender consciences, and toleration of their party, and withal, by putting off their rising, they would be much stronger by many that would come to their party daily. And this informant saith, that he knows to depose what he hath said, because he was one of their party, and was re-baptised by the abovesaid John Ward, and was with them at most of their meetings, and did take the abovesaid oath of secrecy, but being pricked in my conscience at the horror of such a bloody design, he could have no rest nor quietness in his mind, till he had discovered the same.</P>

Birden-hope, a con∣siderable rivulet, washes the skirts of this place, and where Feldon-beck runs into it at a little distance, are the lead mills belonging to the Blacket family.

<P>There is not the least doubt the Romans had a considerable station here<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>Horsley's Brit. Rom. p. 287, 398.</P>
<P>Several Roman antiquities have been found here, which are taken notice of by Dr Hunter in the Philoso∣phical Transactions, N<SUP>o</SUP> 278. One of these is a tall altar, but no visible inscription upon it. Another is said to be a man in a Roman dress, upon a gravestone near the church door. The image is very obscure, nor do I see how it can now be discerned, whether male or female, for there is no inscription at all, and the features are quite gone. There have been two dolphins, one on each side the image, which is somewhat pe∣culiar. When I viewed it, the small figure at the top appeared like a pine-apple, or perhaps a bunch of ears of corn, and that on the side of the image seemed designed for a wreath. I doubt not but it has been se∣pulchral, and that the image was intended to represent the person deceased. <Q>When the ancients erected their own tombs in their life time, they often left the inscriptions, and sometimes their essigies, to be cut by their relations or friends after their decease. So Gorius<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Gor. Monument. libert. &amp;c. Liv. Aug. p. 20.</NOTE>, in his description of a large funeral vault, lately
<PB N="431" REF="455"/>discovered near Rome, has given us the draught of a marble coffin, with a bust of the deceased person cut upon the side, but only a round ball for the head, which doubtless was designed to have been after∣wards finished. And upon another there is a whole human figure finished except the head, which is left in the same manner with the former. And in several of the niches made in the side of the monument, which contained two urns, the inscription is cut over one only, and that part of the stone which is placed over the other is empty, the person being then living for whom that urn was designed.</Q></P>

</FIGURE>This in Camden is placed among the Lanchester inscriptions, but it is plain, from Dr Hunter's account, that it was found at Ebchester. It was first in the doctor's own possession, and is in the library at Durham: It has been a sepul∣chral monument, and <HI>HAVE</HI> is for <HI>AVE,</HI> as in Gruter, <HI>Have Meletina suavi∣ssima.</HI> The custom of thus saluting, as it were, the dead, or taking their last fare∣well of them, is very well known, and it may seem almost needless to produce any instances of it.

<P>There is another stone of a like figure which probably has stood beside it, but there never has been any letters upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Deo Vitiri Maximus votum solvit.</HI></P>
<P>This according to the account in Camden, was also found in this place. It is a small altar erected to the local god <HI>Vitires,</HI> to whom we find a good number of altars inscribed. The letter <HI>A</HI> having no transverse is included in <HI>M</HI> at the beginning of the third line, and the <HI>M</HI> and <HI>V</HI> are connected as usual: The letters are meanly cut. On one side of the altar is a boar, and a toad on the other. It may deserve to be considered, why these noxious creatures should be represented on altars: Whether it might be, that they who erected the altars were much molested with them, and addrest to the deities to be delivered from them. <Q>Tis well known that the ancients used to address to different deities for different benefits, and ascribe names to them suited to the favours which they imagined they received from them. Thus Apollo is said to have been called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> by the Greeks for destroying mice, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in their language signifying a mouse: And as this country might anciently have been infested both with boars and toads, the inhabitants might ap∣ply to this god <HI>Vitires</HI> on that account. And since it was customary with the Romans to adopt into their worship the deities of those nations which they conquered, this <HI>Maximus</HI> might for that reason erect an altar to the god <HI>Vitires,</HI> and cut the figures of these two animals upon it.</Q></P>

It is difficult to make <HI>Numinibus Oceani</HI> of it, or to account for it if it be read so: Possibly the <HI>Vit</HI> in the last line may have been part of <HI>vitam</HI> that is <HI>Ob vitam servatam</HI> or some such thing.</P>

<P>We are also told in Camden, that an urn was found here of a very uncommon shape, near a yard high, and not above seven inches wide, with a little cup in the heart of it, perhaps for an oblation of tears, or of wine and milk, such as the Romans used at the burying of their dead.</P>
<P>Several stones of the centurial kind have been found here. One was discovered a few days before I came there, and is very clear and distinct, having been erected by the fifth cohort of some legion; most likely of the <HI>Legio sexta victrix.</HI></P>
<P>There is another centurial stone, which I have represented at large, in order to shew that these stones were generally like what masons call <HI>through stones,</HI> or however that they were very long, and went a great way in∣to the wall, twice or thrice as far as the other facing stones. Sometimes they are as this, in the form of a pa∣rallelopepid, and sometimes of a pyramidal. I can make nothing out of the letters which appear on this.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="456"/>There are four other centurial stones found here, the two first and finest of them are in the front of a house near the door, but not a visible letter upon them. The next is in the end of a house, and whether the cross within be designed for an <HI>χ, cohors decima,</HI> or only ornamental, I cannot be certain. The last with N<SUP>o</SUP> 4 up∣on it, was before the door of a dwelling-house: The single stroke at last is to me unintelligible; it may be part of an <HI>L,</HI> for <HI>Legionis.</HI> So great a number of these sort of inscriptions make it probable that this sort was built by the legionary cohorts, upon which occasion these stones, as usual, were inserted in the face of the ramparts, or the inscriptions cut out upon them.</P>

<P>Mr Horsley has placed this amongst the inscriptions and sculptures of Northumberland, and says it was of Mr Warburton's collection, and is now in the library at Durham. From whence it came, or where it was found, he does not certainly know.—Rom. Britan. Observ. 233. But Dr Hunter tells us it was taken out of the corner of a barn at Ebchester, by the direction of Dr Montague, late dean of Durham, to be preserved in the library at Durham. Mr Horsley says, I can't find that this stone has ever been published before, tho' it certainly has been curious when perfect. It has been plainly the face of an altar, and not only the capital and base, but part of the plane itself is also demolished; for a line or more has been broken off the top, and two or three letters at least from every line on the left side. <HI>Actarius</HI> was an officer who used to pro∣vide corn for the forces.</P>
<P>There are the remains of two piers in the river Derwent, supposed by some to be part of a Roman bridge; but the present bridge near Ebchester being constructed on piers with a platform of wood, indicates that the first mentioned are much more modern than the time of the Romans, and were forsaken for a more com∣modious passage.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Extract of a letter from Mr John Warburton, to Mr Gale.</HEAD>
<P><Q>It is strange there should be but four great Roman roads recorded, when there are such numbers of them; and more that the greatest of them all should want a name, viz. that which comes from the Ro∣man wall near Dunbrytton frith in Scotland, to Rochester in Northumberland, where <HI>Antoninus</HI> begins his first journey, and from thence continues its course by Corbridge, Ebchester, Lanchester, Binchester, Piere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bridge, Caterick, Aldbrough, and I believe might thence be traced directly forward through Lon∣don to Dover, and this without intersering with any of the four great roads. It is well if Higden, or who∣ever was the first describer of those ways, was not mistaken in his placing the Watling street. The course he has taken for it seems far too short and out of the way, and I rather agree with Talbot, who thinks that <HI>Antoninus's</HI> second journey was along it, viz. from the west end of the Picts wall to Southampton, which I think much more probable, as it enters the country on Gathertey moor,</Q> &amp;c.—<HI>Gale's MSS.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Extract of another letter from Mr Warburten to Mr Gale.</HEAD>
<P><Q>I have read your essay towards a recovery of the four great Roman ways over and over, with greater pleasure than I ever read any thing in my life, and am fully convinced that the course you have taken for those ancient roads are perfectly right, excepting that you lose the stem of the Ermin street upon Gather∣ley moor, and follow only two branches of it that go directly to Tinmouth and Boulness, the two extremes of the Pict's wall, while the main street proceeds northward almost in a streight line and uninterrupted ridge from Piercebridge, close by a small village called <HI>Denton,</HI> where there are many remains of antiquity, and from thence continues its course by <HI>Bolam, Houghton, St Helens Auckland,</HI> and soon after crosses the <HI>Were</HI> to <HI>Binchester, (Vinovium)</HI> where there are to be seen the vestigia of a Roman fort, several altars, and in the possession of Far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Wren, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> the lord of the soil, a great number of Roman coins dug up there. From this place its course is generally over moorish ground to <HI>Lanchester,</HI> and six miles further to <HI>Ebchester,</HI> where it crosses the river Derwent, and enters Northumberland. But before I leave <HI>Ebchester,</HI> which is inferior to no place I have mentioned for antiquities, I cannot but acquaint you that I look upon it to have been the <HI>Vindomora</HI> of <HI>Antoninus,</HI> and not at Wall's-end, where that station has hitherto been fixed, since it exactly answers the distance between <HI>Corstopitum</HI> and <HI>Vinovium,</HI> the 2d and 4th stations in the first iter, viz. nine miles from the first of them and nineteen from the latter, and this in a direct line along one of of the most intire regular and large ways I ever saw, the ridge being for the most part two yards in height, full eight yards broad, and all paved with stone, that it is at present as even as if new laid; whereas from Constapitum, or Corbridge, to Wall's-end, the 3d station in the first iter, it is twenty miles directly cast, and from thence back to Vinovium, the 4th station twenty-five miles to the westward, so that we are car∣ried
<PB N="433" REF="457"/>eighteen miles about upon a road that hath no appearance of a military way, except just where it touches the Pict's wall, and hath the river Tyne to pass in a part where it never could be crossed without boats, which are difficulties I think the Romans would never subject themselves to.</Q></P>

<P>In the first iter of Antonine's Itinerary; the distances of the stations in the county of Durham are thus laid down, including the next stations south and north in Northumberland and Yorkshire: — <HI>A Bremeneo.</HI> Riches∣ter,—<HI>Corstopitum.</HI> M.

<P><HI>Vindomora</HI> nine miles distant from <HI>Corstopitum,</HI> according to the Itinerary, and this next station at Ebchester is distant from Corbridge about seven computed miles, and near ten measured, as was found on actual men∣suration with a chain. This, therefore, is no doubt <HI>Vindomora:</HI> And here again, as in almost all cases, the Roman miles fall short in number of our English measured, almost one in ten, which confirms the Roman to be horizontal. The people told me of two or three load of burnt ashes found here, with some large bones and teeth. The Roman inscriptions and monuments that have been found here may be seen in the collection.</P>
<P>[In the year 1728, a countryman with his plough fixed upon somewhat he could not overturn, he opened the earth, and found an oblong square stone, which by more assistance was removed, finding under it a cavi∣ty, composed of six erected stones, the interstices walled up, and therein an urn about eight inches in height <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">What is included within the brackets are Dr Hunter's MS. observations on the margin of the Britannia, penes Leo, Hartley.</NOTE>.] Dr Gale seems to think that <HI>Vindolana</HI> and <HI>Vindolande</HI> in Ravennas are the same with <HI>Vindomora</HI> in the Itinerary; and then from the affinity of the sound concludes <HI>Dolande</HI> to be it: But I believe the name is <HI>Dotland,</HI> and this is rather too near <HI>Corstopitum,</HI> even though we should prefer the copy that is five miles for the distance instead of nine. But to wave these smaller matters, it is certain that <HI>Vindomora</HI> and <HI>Vindo∣lana</HI> are two different places, and that <HI>Dotland</HI> can neither be one nor the other, for this is quite off the mi∣litary way, and there is no appearance of Roman antiquity here. As to Camden's opinion of <HI>Vindomora</HI> be∣ing Wall's-end, and <HI>Vindobola</HI> being the same, it is needless to confute it, or to add any thing more on this head.</P>
<P>[At a Roman mile and a half distance to the south, some years ago was discovered, the foundation of a square watch tower, about 6 or 8 yards on the west side of the military way; the stones were cemented with lime <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr Hunter, in another of his MS. observations in the year 1727, says, <Q>a little south of the south-west angle of the ramparts, I discovered part of the aqueduct that brought water to the baths; it was composed of two erected flat stones cemented into two niches, cut in one laid flat for the bottom. I am apt to think the ditch of the fortress has been sup∣plied by another aqueduct.</Q></P></NOTE>.] About five computed and six measured miles and a half more along the same military way, which is still very certain and often very grand, bring us to the large and remarkable station at Lanchester, which is not men∣tioned in this iter; the true reasons of which silence I take to be these, that it is too nigh the last station to finish the day's march here, and that it belongs to another iter, which I shall endeavour to shew in its proper place does begin at this station, &amp;c.</P></NOTE>. We paid attention to the great Roman road which leads to this place from the southward, and found it remarkably perfect where the new inclosures of common lands had not taken place. We traced it for a considerable distance, so as to en∣able us strictly to ascertain the dimensions: It is formed in three distinct parts, with four ditches; a center road, probably made for carriages and cavalry, forty-two feet in width, with a narrow road on each side for foot passengers, twelve feet wide: As we had not observed this form in any of the roads in Northumberland, or on the line of the wall, it made us more attentive to ascertain the matter. In the vicinity of large cities our modern roads have the like con∣veniencies;
<PB N="434" REF="458"/>
in this northern situation the circumstance here increases our ideas of the Roman power and possession, when such a station as Ebchester required such conveniencies, either for the ease of passengers, or to accommodate troops who should line the roads and guard the forage or the baggage of armies.</P>

The nave is twenty-six paces in length, and with the ailes fourteen paces wide: The tower stands upon an arch supported by heavy clustered pillars, and there are three narrow windows to the west: The chancel is separated from the nave, by an arch rising from brackets or corbles in the side walls: The front of the south aile was rebuilt in 1627, and is lighted by two modern sashed windows, and a small

You ascend by three steps into the chancel, which is ten paces long and seven wide, stalled with oak on each side, and inclosed by a screen, carved in open foliage work; it is lighted by a large window of five lights to the east, and six small windows to the south: Within the altar rails is the recumbent essigy of an ecclesiastic cut in black and white shell'd marble, such as is won in the bed of the river Were, near Stanhope, in this county; the hands elevated, clasping a book, and the feet resting on a lion.

<P>There is a very large tumulus near the north wall of the church-yard, plant∣ed with trees, whence it is difficult to take the dimensions of its base; it is about twenty perpendicular feet in height, and a beautiful object from the opposite side of Tyne. One somewhat similar, in this parish, near Bradley hall, was opened some little time ago, and therein found a square cavity, composed of stones set on edge, which enclosed the remains and ashes of the interred, but nothing was dis∣covered to denote the age or nation to which it belonged.</P>
<P>Though Ryton is seated in a valley, yet it commands a most beautiful prospect to the north and east. The banks of Tyne rise gradually to a considerable distance, exhibiting as fine a cultivated scene as the north of England produces. The town
<PB N="438" REF="462"/>
of Newburn lies almost on the brink of the river; to the west the villas of Wylam and Cross-house; on the distant landscapes are scattered the towns of Walbottle, Throckley, Heddon-on-the-Wall, and Horseley, with the villa of East Newburn: Further eastward down the vale, Benwell cottage, the plantations above Fenham, and the heights of Newcastle town moor.</P>
<P>In the reign of king Edward I. the 18th of October, 1297, Ryton was burnt by the Scots, whilst the English forces were dishonourably conducted by Warren and Cressengham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abercromby's Hist. of Scotland.</NOTE>.

<P>About the year 1690, that great patron of manufactory and trade, Sir Ambrose Crawley, fixed upon this situation to establish those works which have employed multitudes of people, and caused an influx of wealth since that happy aera, to this country: He first sat down at Sunderland by the sea, where, in its infancy, the project was nursed for five or six years, but the situation of this place and its en∣virons, both in regard to coals and water, induced him to transplant his Cyclopean colony hither. The town of Winlayton stands on a high ridge of country, inclin∣ing on the east, north, and south towards the rivers Tyne and Derwent. Before Sir Ambrose settled his people here, the place consisted of a few deserted cottages, and now contains about fifteen hundred inhabitants, chiefly smiths. The works carried on in this town are various; making nails is the chief branch, but there is an eye of jealousy on enquiry, and the traveller can reap little information as to the various articles manufactured, or quantity produced. The buildings are regular, and calculated for convenience and not shew: The streets are well paved. A com∣modious chapel was built in the year 1705, which will receive three hundred peo∣ple at divine service, and a stipend provided for a chaplain <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>The chapel is said to be erected on the scite of an old chapel, dedicated to St Ann, destroyed in the re∣bellion of the earl of Westmoreland: Human bones have been repeatedly dug up, when there was occasion to break the soil to any depth.</P>

<P>An account of the re-building of Winlaton chapel was printed in London in 1711, to which is prefixed a letter of lord Crewe's, dated from Durham castle, 23d of September, 1710, setting forth, that Mr Jonathan Story had been very instrumental in that work. The narrative is addressed to Henry lord Hyde, by Mr Story, and comprehends an oration delivered by him to the people on occasion of an attempt to found a dissenting meeting-house at Winlaton, where he represents were settled in the manufactory above two thousand souls. Mr Story, though not of the church, in his oration first expatiated on the excellency of religion in general; second, the advantage it hath in the minds of men; third, the excellency of the Christian religion in particu∣lar; and lastly, full thoughts on the established church of England; and he recapitulates the circumstances attending the year 1641, and the succeeding times, with much warmth.—The first place for p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which was licenced 1704-5, was the hall belonging to Sir William Blacket, bart. In June the manufacturers chose a minister of their own, and contributed one half farthing in the shilling for all wages they should re∣ceive, for his support, which made up a considerable sum, and being augmented with ten pounds a year given by the proprietors of the works, made a comfortable subsistance for their clergyman, besides paying all other incident charges of the chapel; at length a certain stipend of fifty pounds a year was fixed for the minister, and the before-mentioned allowance became sufficient to yield above twenty pounds a year for a school. A subscription was next set on foot for building the chapel, which was begun the 17th of April, 1705; on the 23d of August following it was fit to receive the congregation; and in January following it was fully finished and beautified, regularly pewed, and a large gallery at the west end, with a turret and clock: Daily service is performed therein.</P></NOTE>.

which in the last century was used for corn, and had a few cottages near it, now is surrounded with a considerable village, where the iron works are also carried on. It is in a pleasant situation, on the banks of Derwent, with an open prospect to∣wards the east; the number of people employed there may amount to about three hundred of all ages: A stone in the mill dam shews the propitious year of its con∣version, 1691. The chief work carried on there is making and grinding edge tools, slitting bars of iron into long narrow pieces, proper for making nails, &amp;c. Steel is also blistered here, and file-making constitutes a considerable branch of the business, together with a diversity of other articles.</P>
<P>As we are speaking of the manufactory, for the sake of connection, we will ad∣vance to SWALWELL, part of which town is in the parish of Whickham; it is seated on the banks of Derwent, near its influx with the Tyne: The principal part of the in∣habitants are employed in iron works, but in the most massive articles, as ship anchors; they make hoes and shovels, and cast pots, kettles, and other domestic utensils.— Our obliging correspondent, from whom we received much information touching this country, observes to us, that the anchor-smith's shop strikes the spectator with a pleasing astonishment, where the images conceived by the inimitable poet are justly represented:

<P>Here a warehouse is kept for such articles as suit the country demand; the principal storehouses are at Greenwich, and in Thames-street, London. Three ships, appertaining to the company, called the Ambrose, Theodosia, and Elizabeth, are constantly employed in conveying their goods from the north thither. The workmen in Swalwell are still more numerous than at Winlayton. The villages of High and Low Team, situate to the south-east of Swalwell, are chiefly peopled by the manufacturers employed in the same works: There several of the large ar∣ticles are made, and manufacturing saws constitutes a principal branch; the plates are not beat, but produced by fusion in a mould.</P>

<P><PB N="443" REF="469"/><Q>After these works were brought to answer the proprietor's view, his benevo∣lence dictated to him that it was necessary to institute a code of laws for the establishment of peace and good order; not only calculated for the profit and use of the master, but the ease, tranquillity, and happiness of the servant; those, after amendments and additions as cases and exigencies dictated, have become certain and established. To put those laws in execution, a court of arbitrators was constituted at Winlaton, to be holden every ten weeks, for hearing and de∣termining cases among the workmen, to which all have an appeal. The fees are fixed beyond innovation, at a moderate rate. This institution has the most happy and extensive use, it quiets the differences of the people, protects their claims to justice in an easy and expeditious manner, preserves them from the ex∣pences and distress of common law, and the noisome miseries of a prison. As a further protection of civilization, to promote good manners, and inspire re∣ligious principles, schools are established at Winlaton, Winlaton mill, and Swal∣well, for the sole benefit of the workmen's children, where they are instructed in reading, writing, and accounts. The poor and distressed were objects of the founder's solicitude; he appointed a surgeon for the relief of the whole body of workmen, by whose timely assistance many lives and limbs have been preserved to the public: When a workman is ill, he has money advanced by the agent; when superannuated or disabled, he has a weekly maintenance; and when he dies, his family is provided for.</Q> What eulogium can be suitable to the benevolence here displayed, or panegyric express the virtues thus exercised! The exulting spirits of thousands daily breathe praises before Heaven, which no language can compre∣hend. Our correspondent adds, <Q>It is in tears the country confess, none of this excellent family of the name of Crawley at present exist. Mrs Theodosia Crawley, relict of John Crawley, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> the last of the name, died on the 7th of May, 1782, aet. 88. There is no doubt her successors will tread in the same ge∣nerous and benevolent steps.</Q></P>

<P>Opposite to Swalwell, on the northern banks of Derwent, situate on grounds inclining towards the south-east, and diversified by beautiful risings and irregular swells, lies AXWELL PARK, the seat of Sir Thomas Clavering, baronet, an elegant modern house of Payne's architecture, surrounded with a fine park, and groves of
<PB N="444" REF="470"/>
forest wood, disposed with that irregularity which constitutes true rural beauty, maintaining the countenance of nature with the simplest embellishments of art: The house is built of freestone, and placed on elevated ground, so as to command a fine prospect, and become a pleasing object in various points of view in the ad∣jacent country. From its eminence the south front of the house commands a view of the country adjoining Whickham, and the rich wood-lands of Gibside; the east front a prospect of the busy Tyne, Benwell, Newcastle, Gateshead, and the shipping below the bridge; the new bridge of Swalwell of three arches, and the village on the front ground to the right. The old family house was called <HI>Whitehouse,</HI> and stood at the distance of half a mile to the westward of the present mansion, in a sequestered situation. The first of the Claverings whom we find seated here was John Clavering, the son of James Clavering, and grandson of Robert Claver∣ing, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who died in the twenty-fifth year of queen Elizabeth, 1582, whose next successor there was James Clavering, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>The first account we have of the manor of Whickham is in the Boldon Book, where the bishop had xxxv villain tenants, each of whom held an oxgang of land, consisting of fifteen acres, at sixteen pence rent, exclusive of services, which were severe. Every villain wrought for the lord three days each week in the year, besides the labour of harvest and plowing; they were bound to erect a cottage forty feet long, and fifteen wide, every year, for the maintenance of the town, and carry and fetch from Durham and Bedlington, the bishop's baggage, &amp;c. when re∣quired, with the allowance of the corrody whilst they wrought. They also paid nine shillings cornage rent, and provided a milch cow for the lord, and for every oxgang of land they found a hen and ten eggs, and served in the lord's fishery in Tyne. The headborough man, who is stiled <HI>praepositus,</HI> now called the greve, had twenty-four acres of land allotted to him in recompense for the duties of his office. The manor was then under firm with the villain service, mills, carts, barrows, fisheries, and twenty chalder of oats of the bishop's measure, rendering twenty-seven pounds, and performing certain services in carriage, for which there was an al∣lowance of two pence for every horse. The punder had land assigned him, besides an acknowledgement from every tillage farm by the threave; and he provided the bishop with forty hens and three hundred eggs.

<P>The town of Whickham hangs on the brow of a hill, with an open eastern as∣pect: The chief buildings, which are many of them modern and handsome, stand on the southern side, on the brink of a steep descent, so as to overlook the rest of the town: The prospect is remarkably beautiful, comprehending part of Gateshead, with the church, the tower of St Nicholas in Newcastle, the castle, and much of the town on the margin of the river; to the right, Gateshead fell, patched with innumerable cottages, quarries, wind mills, and other objects; to the left, the pleasant villages of Ryton, Benwell, Elswick, Newburn, Lemmington, and other places before noted, whilst through the deep vale the river Tyne<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Along the banks of the river are arranged the staiths for the reception of coals, and delivering them into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eels or lighters, to carry down to the shipping, called Blaydon staiths, Dunstan staiths, &amp;c.</P>

<P>In the town of Whickham there is a stratum of burnt earth, consisting chiefly of clay and stone: Accord∣ing to tradition, the king's army had their tents in some land called the church land, below the church, and in other fields contiguous; that the Scots under the command of Lesley, at that time lay at Newburn; and upon his crossing the river for the purpose of attacking the king's army, the latter fled with such precipita∣tion, that they left their tents and set fire to them, this fire communicated to a small seam of coal at day, and many years burnt with great fury; at night the flames were seen from different parts of the village and grounds adjoining: The fire is now out, and the burnt earth and stones are commonly used for the highways.</P> <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> forms a fine

<P>The church of Whickham shews much antiquity in its architecture, and very little beauty: There are two side ailes, separated from the center by three short round pillars, and four circular arches, without any mouldings, the capitals of the columns square, with a rose or knot at the corners; the whole nave ill lighted, and the west end crouded with galleries, thrown into four angles; the pulpit is in the center, and faces the south.

In bishop Langley's time, Roger de Thornton acquired the manor of Axsels of Thomas de Redhough, and the same passed by the heiress of that family with their other large possessions.</P>
<P>The manor of HOLLINSIDE was the estate of the Burtons, alias Burdens, in the time of bishop Bury, and was held <HI>in capite</HI> by homage, fealty, and suit of court, rendering 6s. 8d. in silver at the exchequer. It soon afterwards became the estate of the Redhoughs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Quickham, Hatfield's Survey.</NOTE>, by the marriage of Agnes the daughter and heiress of Hugh Burton, alias Burden. It came afterwards to the Massams; and in the tenth of bishop Langley, was aliened by Robert de Massam to trustees, under limi∣tations to the heirs of the bodies of him and Agnes his wife. The Hardings were owners, and in the tenth year of bishop Nevill, Ralph Harding, son and heir of Sir Richard Harding, had livery thereof. The last male of that family died in poverty, and the estate fell into the hands of the family of Bowes by foreclosure of mortgage.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="478"/>The adjacent country wears an unpleasant aspect to the traveller, cut and har∣rowed up with loaded carriages, scattered over with mean cottages, from whence swarm forth innumerable inhabitants, maintained by working in the mines; where many a sooty face is seen by every hedge-way side: The workmen earn great wages, which recompense every other evil. The meagreness of the tract by which you pass to the environs of Gibside, renders the scene more striking, and enhances the beauties of the pass which leads immediately to those Elysian shades.</P>
<P>By a serpentine road, for a mile in length, you wind through the bosom of a thick forest, sometimes on the brink of a deep valley, at intervals descending on the easy inclination of the hill, still embowered with venerable oaks, before you ap∣proach the mansion and enter the opener works: The first escape from the wood presents you with a view of the banqueting-house, on a very elevated situation, terminating a spacious avenue: This structure is in a high Gothic stile, garnished with pinnacles. After passing a piece of water, the chief objects open upon you; to the right lies a noble sylvan scene, of great extent, hanging on inclining grounds, from a lofty summit, to the very skirts of the vale; in the midst of which, as a terminating object to the grand vista, rises a fine <HI>Ionic</HI> column of stone, highly wrought, not less, as we compute, than one hundred and forty feet in height, finished with an elegant gilt statue of <HI>British Liberty,</HI> in whose service the person who erected the work was enthusiastically virtuous: As you turn from this object, you look upon a terrace above a mile in length, terminated by a new chapel, built in a most elegant stile, with a rich portico and dome, highly embellished. The chief parts of the mansion-house are old, of the architecture which prevailed in the beginning of the seventeenth century, containing many spacious apartments: The back part of the house is placed so near the brink of a very steep descent, as merely to admit a terrace walk; from whence is a prospect, though narrow, highly picturesque and beautiful; you look down into a deep vale of meadow grounds, washed by the river Derwent, shut in on the right by hanging woods, and on the left by cultivated lands rising in irregular swells from the banks of the river, and terminated in the center by a lofty cliff much shaken and torn: Walks are cut through the groves, and wind along the margin of the river: Although nature has spread various rich gifts over the scene, yet art has bestowed a multitude of embellishments; the buildings before mentioned, the green-house, bath, and other edifices, are finished in a good taste, and some of them in a superb stile; with regard to the sylvan beauties, they are not to be paralleled in the whole county.</P>
<P>There are some good pictures in the house; among the chief is a large piece of Rubens's wife, whilst pregnant, in a fruit-shop; the expression is inimitable, yet at∣tempted to be rivalled by the curiosity of the old woman she addresses; the col∣lection of fruit is infinite, and well displayed. A picture of game, the painter's name not known, the figures large as life; an excellent painting. In the study is a fine portrait of Sir Martin Bowes. A portrait, marked A.

<P>The ancient borough of Gateshead consists chiefly of one long street, descending to the bridge leading over Tyne to Newcastle: Much doubt has arose with our antiquaries touching the etymology of the name. It must content us to accept the Saxon appellation of Gaetsheved as sufficiently expressive of this place; where, if the Romans had a bridge, it is probable they also had a tower and gate for its defence; and after the Saxons were possessors, we may conceive this material pass was strongly fortified, and thence the name of <HI>Gaetsheved</HI> may be derived, from the circumstance of the street leading to the tower and gate of the bridge. The word <HI>gaet</HI> or <HI>gate</HI> is commonly used for <HI>way</HI> in this country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Gabrocentum hodie Gateshead, sive ad caprina capite Gabrocentum.

<P>The most material circumstance in which we find Gateshead noted in ancient history, is touching the catastrophe related of bishop Walcher, when on the 14th of May, 1080, the church was reduced to ashes. We have no account that shews when Gateshead church was first erected, or by whom; but from the preceding cir∣cumstance,
<PB N="454" REF="482"/>
it appears to be one of the most ancient within the district. When or from whom the borough of Gateshead had its foundation we are also ignorant; the first record we find relative to it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bourne, in his History of Newcastle. p. 171, sets out a grant from bishop Philip, but he doth not point out where the original is to be found, or whence he had his translation is not in the large collections before us.</NOTE> is that of bishop Pudsey, in the year 1164, in which he gives to the burgesses of Gateshead the liberty of his forest there, under certain restrictions: By this charter the bishop grants also to the burgesses, <HI>that each shall have in right of his burgage similar liberties to those enjoyed by the burgesses of Newcastle in right of their burgages;</HI> and that they shall have free passage within the liberties of the palatinate with their goods, clear of all dues and exactions <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Concessio libertatis de forestagio burgensibus de Gatesheved per Hugonem Pudsey episc.

In 1557 bishop Tunstall granted a charter to the company of glovers within the borough of Gateshead. In 1602 bishop Matthew incorporated sundry trades: And bishop Cosin, by his letters pa∣tent, bearing date at Durham, the 16th day of September, the thirteenth of king Charles II. A. D. 1661, incorporated the drapers, taylors, mercers, hardwaremen, coopers, and chandlers in Gateshead, into a commonalty, fellowship, and company. In king Edward the Sixth's time Gateshead was annexed to Newcastle, but in the succeeding reign it was re-united to the bishopric of Durham.</P>
<P>The religious settlements at Monkchester would most probably encourage others on the southern shore. We repeat what the ingenious Mr Grose has said touching <HI>the hospital of St Edmund,</HI> before our readers proceed to the records: <Q>This house seems to have been of no great eminence, since it is not mentioned by Dugdale, except in his general catalogue of the religious houses and their value, where there is the following entry among those of Durham; <HI>Gatesheved, hospital of St Edmund,</HI> 5<HI>l.</HI> 9<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> It is only thus slightly touched on by Tanner, <HI>ad caprae caput, Goatshead or Gateshide, a monastery here, whereof Uttan was abbot before A.

In the latter is a transcript from the former, where, among the holy men chosen by Peada, son of king Penda, to in∣struct him in the Christian religion, one <HI>Adda is mentioned, who is there said to be brother to Uttan, an illustrious presbyter and abbot of the monastery called Goatshead:</HI> Tanner likewise cites Bourne, who in his History of Newcastle says, <HI>the monastery of Uttanus was where Mr Riddle's or Gateshead house now is.</HI> From the following passage in Leland's Itinerary, vol. vii. part i. page 78, added to the entry before quoted from Dugdale's Catalogue, it appears as if this monastery was converted into an hospital before the dissolution of religious houses; <HI>whereas the hospital</HI> (says he) <HI>is now of St Edmund at Gateshed in Wyrale, was some tyme a monastary as I have hard, and be lykelyhod the same that Bede spekythe of.</HI> In the Magna Britan∣nia, published in 1720, a different relation is given of this house, to that taken

From these obscure accounts little to be depended upon can be collected respecting its ancient history; the following is its present state: Its remains stand in Gateshead, on the east or right hand side of the high street leading to Newcastle bridge, from which it is distant about half a mile. The entrance is through a low square stone gate, decorated with pilasters, and seemingly of modern construction. The scite of the house with its offices and gardens, occupied about two acres and a half of land: Towards the east end of it are the ruins of a mansion, which, from the stile of its architecture, seems to have been built since the dissolution of the monastery, perhaps out of its materials. This probably was Mr Riddle's house alluded to by Bourne, and the gateway before mentioned was in all likelihood erected at the same time. Nearest the road stands the chapel, whose west end is handsomely ornamented with a number of pointed arches and niches, though the inside seems remarkably plain: It consists of a single aile, twenty-one paces broad, by twenty-six long; some steps at the east end leading to the altar are still remaining; near them is a grave stone, on which is cut a cross similar to that on the jamb of the church door at Jarrow; it has also the marks of an inlaid border about it, but the brass is gone. The arches of the windows (except those of the east and west ends, which are entirely pointed) are round within, and pointed on the outside. A remarkable ornament is mounted on the east end, on a slender rod, being a small circle chequered by several bars crossing each other at right angles. In the year 1745 or 46, this chapel, being, as it is said, made use of by the Roman Catholics, was out of a misguided zeal set on fire by some persons, who perhaps meant to pass for good Protestants, but by this their intolerant fury, shewed them∣selves to be actuated by those very principles they affected so much to contemn. This monastery is now the property of Ralph Clavering, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Callaly, and is chiefly used for garden ground <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This account is attended with an elegant view of the chapel.</P>
<P>The house and garden ground, &amp;c. were purchased about two years ago by Hen. Ellison, <ABBR>esq</ABBR>—The mines were reserved upon this sale.</P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>This account gives us ground to suppose, that on the martyrdom of bishop Wal∣cher, the old monastery and church were reduced to ashes; but whether they were situated where Mr Grose has attempted to place them, the reader will form his own conjectures. In the quotation from the Magna Britannia, it is said, touching the hospital of St Edmund, "who was the founder or benefactor is not known." It is probable that the ruined monastery, which had been a scene of such violation, sacrilege, and murder, would lie under the horror of those crimes, deserted and un∣restored for some time; and it was not till the year 1247 that we hear of the hos∣pital rising, as Mr Grose has presumed, from its ashes. In that year, bishop Farnham founded <HI>the hospital of St Edmund the Confessor in Gateshead,</HI> for a master

<P>Though the preceding grants shew this hospital of St Edmund in Gateshead, with all the lands belonging to it, were granted 27th Henry VI. 1449, to the prioress and nuns of St. Bartholomew in Newcastle; yet it is valued 26th Henry VIII. 1535, (on the general survey) as having in yearly revenues 109l. 4s. 4d. according to Speed; 5l. 9s. 4d. according to Dugdale; and 6l. 2s. 4d. clear by the MS. val.</P>
<P>N. B. The only way to reconcile the great difference between these two valuations, is to suppose it originally wrote 109s. 4d. and that Speed's transcriber mistook, and put pounds for shillings, or that there were two hospitals as after mentioned, and that by the coal working, licenced by bishop Neville to the master of St Edmund the martyr, the great revenue arises.</P>
<P>Thirty-one of the lesser houses had the king's licence in the 28th year of his reign. 1537, to be resounded and continue some time longer; and the hospital of St Bartholomew in Newcastle is said to be one of the number.—<HI>Tanner's Notitia, pref. p.</HI> 37.—<HI>Burton's Mon.

<P>Near the town of Newcastle appears to have been a small Benedictine nunnery, as old as the time of Wil∣liam the Conqueror: It was dedicated to St Bartholomew, and had a little before the dissolution ten nuns, when it was valued at 36l. 10d. by Dugdale, and 37l. 4s. 2d. by Speed.—<HI>Tanner's Notitia, p.</HI> 391.</P>
<P>Agnes Lawson, the last prioress, surrendered this convent the 3d of January, 31st Henry VIII. 1540, and had a pension of 6l. assigned her, and enjoyed it in 1553, in which year there remained in charge the follow∣ing pensions, viz.</P>

From this deed it may be understood, by implication, that the hospital had been a second time erected before the time of this charter: The original constitution was totally altered, and indeed one may ap∣prehend, that the first foundation was utterly dissolved; who had again begun this pious work, or when, we have no record to shew. This charter tells us the muni∣ments which evidenced the foundation and endowment were lost; such could not be the case if it arose from the original institution by bishop Farnham; the more modern foundation, in the distraction of those times which intervened between the year 1535 and 1610, might probably be lost or destroyed; and this observation gains strength by the reference in the charter to <HI>sixty years quiet enjoyment, by the master appointed thereby and his predecessors,</HI> expressions not only useless, but repug∣nant to common sense, if the hospital was instantly rising under that charter. Not having other records to refer to in support of the idea, we leave the conjectures for the reader's application<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr Smith, in his edition of Bede's Ecclesiast.

<P><PB N="460" REF="488"/>From all the uncertainties noted in the account of St Edmund's, it is probable king James's foundation did not affect the chapel described by Mr Grose, but that the nuns of Newcastle had a cell there, within the ancient limits of the hospital possessions; perhaps on the scite of the hospital of the Holy Trinity, or that there were two hospitals, one dedicated to St Edmund the bishop, and the other to St Edmund king and martyr, in distant and distinct situations; or how can we recon∣cile the facts of the chapel so described going to decay, and that together with the whole scite of the adjacent buildings and surrounding lands being in lay hands for se∣veral generations, totally unconnected with the present hospital, notwithstanding the words of king James's foundation charter. Bishop Hatfield's Survey speaks of the hospitals of St Edmund the king, and St Edmund the confessor distinctly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide notes preceding.</NOTE>. There is an irreconcilable confusion in this subject, and we are apt to believe there were two religious foundations here dedicated as before noted, one to St Edmund the confessor, appropriated to St Bartholomew in Newcastle, which was dissolved under the surrender of that monastery, and another of a foundation now unknown, which had been exempted from the dissolution, and refounded by king James, dedicated to St Edmund king and martyr, notwithstanding the complex description of lands, &amp;c. in the royal charter. Mr Riddle's house was called Gateshead house, and as Mr Grose observes, is of a mode of architecture denoting a date subsequent to the suppression of religious houses, and whilst in his or the family of Callaly's posses∣sion, there is an obvious reason why it might be in use in the year 1745<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Hospital of St Edmund.—Proc. ep. 13 s. 4 d.—Real. value 200l.</P>

<P>TYNE BRIDGE in part appertains to the county of Durham: It is of great anti∣quity, and several authors of note have supposed the Romans had an open com∣munication between their stations on the northern and southern shores of Tyne at this place.

By the charter of king Henry II. the bishop had confirmed to him the right of ships plying in his part of Tyne, as fully and freely as the king possessed that usage on the other. Bourne, speaking of this bridge, says, <Q>It has been a query whether the bridge was originally of wood or stone; but I think it is al∣together needless, all the bridges in England were originally of wood. In the reign of king Richard I.

any licence.</HI> This I imagine has been for building of keys, and especially for the repairing of the bishop's part of the bridge, which is a further proof that this bridge was wood. But what I think puts it beyond dispute is, that accord∣ing to Matthew Paris, it was burnt in the year 1248, together with a great part of the town <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 728.

The archdeacon of Northumberland wrote to the clergy of his archdeaconry to assist the work of the bridge; telling them, their venerable father the lord bishop of Durham by his letters patent had commanded them without any let or delay, to go about the affair of the indulgences, and that they were to prefer the episcopal indulgences to others; and what arose from them was to be given to the master of the bridge, whose name was Laurentius, for the use of the bridge. <HI>Lib.

the river Tyne and the bridge and tower thereupon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Annals of bishop Langley, vol. i. p. 333, records in the notes.</NOTE>. About the year 1512 bishop Ruthall repaired the south part of the bridge. Under the act of dissolution of 1553, all the possessions of the bishopric were vested in the crown, and by the act of the succeeding year, when Gateshead was annexed to Newcastle, the lands called Salt Meadows, with the whole river of Tyne and the bridge passed therewith, and were adjudged to be within the county and shire of the town of Newcastle, and that the inhabitants of Gateshead should be under the rule, government, and correction of the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle. All these were restored in 1554, as before mentioned. The bridge, after the conflagration in 1248, was rebuilt on twelve stone arches, three of which, by the construction of quays, on the Newcastle side, were thought unnecessary, and converted into cellars: About the middle of the bridge a tower was erected, with machicolations and iron gates; a little to the southward of which the boundary stone was fixed, to distinguish the division of the counties; the end from thence to Gateshead belonging to the bishop of Durham. At the south end was another tower, and from the vacancy in the archings, there wanting an arch near the southern tower, it has been presumed there was in that space a draw-bridge. The bishops of Durham have for time immemorial possessed all rights and privileges of the bridge, from the boundary stone southwards, being called a third part, and granted leases for lives or years, of all houses and shops erected thereon, and as occasion required repaired that part of the bridge. In July 1770, bishop Trevor repaired with stone the space before noted, where it is supposed the draw-bridge was; it was laid with large beams of timber, and cover∣ed with thick planks, upon which the pavement was made: This work was begun on Saturday night or Sunday morning, and finished on Thursday following, all the materials of stone being previously prepared, and a proper number of workmen, with boats and wherries above and below bridge, for conveying passengers and car∣riages over the river during the time of the work. In the night between the 16th and 17th of November, 1771, there was a flood in the river Tyne, greatly exceeding any noted in history or otherwise known, by the force of which an arch north of the toll-gate was first swept away<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A curious view of the ruined bridge was engraved and published by Mr Beilby of Newcastle.</NOTE>, then another on the south end fell, with eight houses on the west side of it, those on the east hanging by their timbers. On Mon∣day the 18th, about four in the afternoon, another of the south arches fell, with the houses thereon, and the remaining parts of the bridge were so much shattered, that it was necessary to take the superstructure down. Only seven persons were lost by the fall of the several houses. The river began to rise at Newcastle about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, and at five in the morning the arches of the bridge were filled, so that a current was forced into the west end of the street called the Close, which runs parallel with the river; it overflowed the Sandhill-square, so that boats plied there, and many of the shops had five feet water in them: The water exceed∣ed every other flood of which we have any note; by eight perpendicular feet in height; and infinite loss and damage was sustained on the shores and in the ship∣ing and craft. In 1772 an act of parliament was obtained for making a temporary
<PB N="465" REF="493"/>
bridge, by the corporate body of Newcastle, to continue for seven years, (provided a new one of stone was not erected, or the old bridge restored in less time) with toll-gates thereon, and the tolls to be applied in reimbursing to the corporation such money as they should expend therein over and above the sum of 2400l. which they voluntarily gave to the work: And in the same year an act of parliament was made to enable the lord bishop of Durham and his successors to raise a competent sum of money, to be applied for repairing, improving, or rebuilding such part of Tyne bridge as belongs to the See of Durham. The preamble sets forth, that the lord bishop of Durham is entitled in right of his See, to one-third part of an ancient bridge extending across the river Tyne, between the town of Gateshead in the county palatine of Durham, and the town of Newcastle upon Tyne; and that by the violence and rapidity of a most extraordinary flood, which happened on the 17th day of November, 1771, in the river Tyne, the said bridge was damaged and broken down in several places, and rendered impassable: And in order to restore an easy and safe communication between the counties of Durham and Northumber∣land, it is highly expedient that the said bridge should be rebuilt, and effectually repaired with all possible expedition; and that the necessary repairs of one-third part of the said bridge, belonging to the bishop of Durham in right of his See, and extending from two blue marble or boundary stones, on the south side of the said bridge, to the town of Gateshead, will be attended with great expence, and however reasonable or proper it may be, that the entire sum necessary to be appropriated for, and employed in that useful and necessary work, ought to be raised out of or secured upon the revenues and possessions of the said See of Durham, and that the bishop of Durham for the time being, ought not to bear any greater burthen than shall arise from the interest or annual charge to be paid in respect of the principal mo∣ney to be raised for the purpose aforesaid; yet the said lord bishop consenting, that a reasonable and adequate sum of money may be raised by authority of parliament, by granting annuities for lives, which will not only be speedy and effectual, but may be a method less burthensome to the successors in the said See than to the said now lord bishop, by the eventual dropping in of lives and the decrease of such temporary charge; it is thereby enacted, that the chancellor of the bishopric and county palatine of Durham and Sadberge, the sheriff of the county, &amp;c. the vicar-general and principal official of the diocese of Durham, the attorney and solicitor general to the lord bishop of Durham, the principal register or registrar of the diocese of Durham, the auditor to the lord bishop of Durham, the keeper of Auck∣land castle, the steward of the halmote courts of the lord bishop of Durham, the clerk of the halmote courts of the lord bishop of Durham, the clerk of the great receipt of the exchequer of Durham, the register of the court of chancery of Dur∣ham, the clerk of the court of chancery of Durham, the keeper of the rolls of the chancery aforesaid, the clerk of the itinerant justices and other justices whomsoever in the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge, and the bailiff of the borough of Auckland for the time being, or any three of them, are thereby appointed trustees to put the said act in execution, by and under the direction of the bishop and his successors, for repairing, rebuilding, or improving such part of the said bridge as
<PB N="466" REF="494"/>
belongs to the See of Durham: And to raise any sum not exceeding 12,000 l. for the purposes aforesaid, by granting annuities not exceeding 10 l. per cent. to be paid by the receiver-general of the bishop and his successors, out of the revenues of the See of Durham.</P>

<P>GATESHEAD CHURCH is a spacious building, capable of receiving a very numerous congregation, and kept in that order due to places of divine worship: It is very light, and receives a good circulation of air: The chancel, from the altar rails, is nine paces long and six wide; the east window consisting of five lights; there are also three windows to the south, and two to the north, under pointed arches: The communion table is supported by cherubs, in stone work; near which are three recesses or seats in the wall within the rails, for priests officiating in the ancient service, and an aperture for a water bason. This church is built upon a regular plan, in the form of a cross, with side ailes, separated from the center by five point∣ed arches, supported on octagonal columns about fifteen feet high, very light and well proportioned, having this singularity, that they are without capitals, the arches springing from the shafts, like the ramifications of a tree, which gives them a beautiful appearance; the arches are about sixteen feet in span: The whole length of the nave is twenty-eight paces, and its width sixteen; the cross aile is twenty-four paces long. The south end of the cross is lighted by one large window of five lights,
<PB N="467" REF="495"/>
and two to the east of three lights each; the ailes have each two square windows of three lights: The upper arrangements are regular, consisting of five windows un∣der circular arches. The church is regularly stalled with oak, ornamented with fleur-de-lis, has a pretty small organ, and galleries at the west end: The font is a large black marble laver: The pulpit is placed against the first south pillar. The adjacent ground is called the Anchorage or Anchoritage, where the school∣house stands, with the beadle's house and other edifices belonging the church. The steeple was rebuilt in 1740<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Gateshead Rectory.</HI>—Dedicated to St Mary.—Bishop of Durham patron.</P>

In the church-yard is the monument of one Robert Trollop, a famous architect; it is a square building, the lower part of brick, the upper of stone, and of that heavy taste which prevailed about the time of king James I. when Trollop lived. It was embellished around the top under the cornice with several scripture passages, in gold letters on a black ground,

<P>We now approach Jarrow, once a place of great consequence, and of distant antiquity. Little more remained of this once famous town when we visited it in 1782, than two or three mean cottages, the distracted ruins of the old monastery, the church, a venerable pile, then patched up so as to retain few traces of its ori∣ginal figure, and the capacious haven, now called the <HI>Slake,</HI> washed full of sand, and left dry by the river Tyne at ebb of tide.</P>
<P>The monasteries of Weremouth and Jarrow were the most ancient of any within the limits of this county: That of Weremouth, dedicated to St Peter, we are told, was built in the fourth year of king Egfrid, at the instance of Benedict a monk, who became the superior or governor of both houses: The monastery of Jar∣row, dedicated to St Paul, was erected in the fifteenth year of the same king; the place being then called <HI>Gyrwy</HI> or <HI>Girvy.</HI> Retirement and seclusion were not the principles which directed the choice of this situation; for if the original mo∣nastery was placed where the present ruins are, the ground is elevated, and forms a curvature towards the great bay called the Slake, which ancient authors tell us was the haven of Egfrid, where, consistent with the burthen of vessels used in that age, a thousand sail might lie moored in the greatest security. Leland says, Jar∣row is distant from Newcastle four miles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. vol. ii. p. 302, 303.</NOTE>, but by land it is seven, and more by

water: There is no ground near the present remains of a more solemn or secluded situation which can answer the description given by Roger Hoveden, for he calls it <HI>Monasterium Doni Amnis,</HI> from a rivulet which runs from the southward into the Slake <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Ex Historia Rogeri Hovedini</HI> DCCXCIIII.</P>

<P>In the year 703, St Benedict, an English abbot, rested in the Lord. He was nobly born, in his youth a soldier, then minister to king Oswy, and having great possessions, resolved to leave the world for Christ, and going to Rome, at his return had the land of forty families given him by Egfrid king of Northumberland, to build a monastery to St Peter, at the mouth of the river Were, and another in honour of St Paul at Girroy. —Monast.

The descriptions given by ancient writers, of religious edifices, nearly of the date of this monastery, which arose about 684, lead us not to expect one re∣maining trace of the first structure, without we should discover it in the repositories of the dead; for as such fabrics chiefly consisted of timber and reeds, the sacrilege committed by barbarians in repeated invasions, would most probably sweep away every part thereof. In the fifth year of Ethelred's reign after his restoration, and during the episcopacy of bishop Higbald, the Danes and rovers from the north en∣tered the river Tyne, and laid this monastery in ashes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Portus Ecfridi sinus qui a Tina at Girwi penetrat. penetrabat &amp; interius usq. ad <HI>Bilton,</HI> pene 3 pas.

habitation and church: But their peace was not of long continuance; for in the seventh year of Osbert's reign, the Danes again entered the Tyne, practising their accustomed rapine and devastation, and laying waste all the religious houses. In the interval, whilst the See or episcopal seat was fixed at Chester, we may reason∣ably presume the monastery at Jarrow was again restored; and from the stile and order of architecture, we are led to conjecture, that part of the structures standing at the time we visited them, were of that age: But the religious body had not yet sustained the last of their misfortunes, for though subject to all the miseries of the provincial war which distracted this part of the island, during the struggles between the Saxon and Danish sovereigns, when they were frequently pillaged and laid under contributions. Upon the enraged Normans marching northward, and find∣ing the city of Durham deserted, and the country evacuated, they put their sacri∣legious hands to this monastery, and notwithstanding they boasted of the dispensa∣tion of the gospel, yet, as savage as the unenlightened barbarians of the north, they reduced the sacred edifices again to ashes. Having advanced to this period, we should now pay attention to the venerable character of Bede, and present to the reader some short anecdotes of his life.</P>
<P>This holy monk was born about the year 672, in a part of this county adjoining the river Were, where the monastery of Weremouth afterwards had lands; that house not being founded till the year 674, according to his own account thereof: Much controversy has happened relative to the place of his nativity, but it is well settled by historians, that he was born in the district before mentioned: At seven years of age he was taken into the monastery at Weremouth, and under the care of abbot Benedict and his successor Ceolfrid received his education; at the age of nineteen was ordained deacon, and became exemplary at that early stage for his piety and studious life: The attention paid to him by all ranks of people, so far from moving him with vanity, or tempting him to negligence, seemed only to excite him to a more eager pursuit of learning, and stricter rules of religious conduct, inso∣much that his character was held forth as a pattern of Christian virtues, and his life as an example of monastic duty. About the year 685, in the fifteenth of king Egfrid, the monastery of Jarrow was founded under the conduct and superintendency of Benedict: Bede attained his thirtieth year before he was ordained priest, which of∣fice was performed by John of Beverley, then bishop of Hexham, who had been his preceptor, and entertained great affection for him; much of his excellent cha∣racter was deduced from maxims instilled by that great teacher, which he constant∣ly professed to follow as the chief principles of his conduct. His great diligence and application, comprehensive genius, and extensive learning, rendered his name so famous, that he became the subject of attention in foreign countries, particularly at Rome, where pope Sergius, struck with the accounts he heard of this illustrious scholar, wrote to his superior the abbot Ceolfrid to send him thither, that he might converse with him on some momentous subjects. Bede, as singular in his modesty as accomplishments, received the summons without any of that emotion this flatter∣ing distinction would have roused in many other minds; but attentive alone to his studies, and the due performance of religious duties, he was not to be allured from
<PB N="473" REF="501"/>
his cell by the smiles of potentates, and the courtesy of princes. It has been re∣marked by many authors, that in pursuance of Ceolfrid's command, he was or∣dained priest preparatory to his journey to Rome; but why he did not obey the call, has not been accounted for by those writers, further than that it is observed the pope died in 701, which event might not be known in England at the time of our monk's receiving ordination. No notice is taken of the foregoing circum∣stances by Bede in any of his writings, and the whole rests chiefly on the account given by William of Malmsbury and his copyists. It is certain he shewed at all times a particular desire for privacy and retirement, an avidity for learning, and an incessant application to study, together with a warm affection for his native country; such might operate powerfully with his own mind against the journey, whilst the consequence he was of to the northern clergy, might influence the great people to sue for his release from an engagement so disagreeable to his own wishes; and contrary to the interests of his country. By remaining in his monastery, and habituating himself to a recluse life, he had sufficient time to make himself master of every branch of literature which at that period had gained a footing in this island; and his acquisitions were made without any apparent desire of same or promotion, but merely to render himself useful to society, and for the promotion of religion and virtue. It was from such principles that he applied himself for several years in collecting materials for his Ecclesiastical History, which received in the early ages of the English church infinite applause, and at this time is esteemed an inestimable record; in the composition of which great work the several legendary and miraculous relations are considered as merely the errors of the age, and not blots of the excellent pen which related them. Though Bede was bred at Weremouth, yet it is admitted by all writers he took up his residence at Jarrow, soon after that monastery was founded, and the same superior govern∣ing both houses, much intercourse was had between the religious societies; so that we see him at periods spoken of by some writers as a monk of Weremouth, and by others of Jarrow, which variance is easily reconciled when we consider the before-related fact. Bede published his Ecclesiastical History in 731, when, ac∣cording to his own account, he was fifty-nine years of age; but before this he had written many other books, on a variety of subjects, a catalogue of which he sub∣joined to that great work. There was a strict friendship subsisting between Egbert bishop of York and Bede, which produced a letter from our monk, descriptive of the tempers and characters of both, and giving a picture of the manners of the age, and the state of the church, such as no other authority supplies; full of servour, religious censure, virtuous zeal, and bold condemnation. The letter discovers the collective mind of the author, whilst his prophetic reasonings and the distant con∣sequences he deduced and predicted from the inordinances described, shew the shrewdness of his judgment, and the capaciousness of his observation: He foresaw the multiplying of religious foundations, and the want of discipline which daily broke in upon the conventual rules, would bring on the destruction which in after ages took place. When he wrote this epistle he was in a bad state of health, his death from that time advancing by a gradual decay; yet in all the progressive
<PB N="474" REF="502"/>
stages of the disease he did not neglect his duty, he employed the usual hours in writing, in study, in devotion, in exhortation of the brethren, and teaching his dis∣ciples of the convent. He endured the attacks of death with great fortitude, ex∣emplary piety, and holy resignation, and expired on the 26th of May, being the feast of the Ascension, in the year 735 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epilogum de obitu Bedae, ex sine libri 1<SUP>i</SUP> Gulielm. a Maildulphi curia de reg.—Script.

<P>Soon after bishop Walcher was settled in the See, he invited certain Bene∣dictines to take up their abode at Jarrow; they found the monastic buildings in ruin, though it appears some walls were yet standing, over which they formed a roof of wood, and thatched it with straw, where they renewed divine offices. The society increasing rapidly, the bishop granted various lands for their support, and they began to rebuild their church. The reader will revert to the account given of this society under the annals of bishop Walcher. Bishop William de Carilepho confirmed to the monks of Jarrow the endowment made by his predecessor; and soon after removing the seculars from the cathedral church, he translated the monks of this house to Durham, and from thenceforth Jarrow became only a cell to the monastery of Durham. When Galfrid de Burdon was elected prior of Durham, on his predecessor's resignation, he had this cell with the manor of Wardle assigned for his maintenance. At the suppression of religious houses Jar∣row was valued at 38 l. 14s. 4d. according to Dugdale, and 40l. 7s. 8d.

<P>The ruins of the old monastery lie to the south of the church, on a ridge of land inclining gently towards the flat or slake, which is washed by the tide; no part remains so perfect as to point out to what distinct office it belonged: At the west end is a gabel, in which there is a round arched window, composed of that species of architecture which prevailed in the Saxon time, and we venture to alledge was antecedent to the devastation made by the Norman soldiers: The uppermost orna∣ment is of the dental figure, succeeded below by zig-zags, and the lowest members

<P>William of Malmsbury says, a spirit of ignorance and laziness invaded this island, and there was a general decay of all useful knowledge and neglect of history.

The entrance into the church was by a low porch with a circular arch, on the north jamb of which was the figure of a crosier staff, stripped from some of the ancient tombs: The descent into the nave was by three deep steps, on the side walls of which were two pointed arches, that to the north built up, the other opening into a porch used as a vestry room; the groins were sprung from brackets, and the span was about twenty feet: The nave was twenty-eight paces in length, and only six in width; so that, from the height of the side walls, which were nearly thirty feet, and the small irregular windows scatter∣ed on each side, the edifice had a very singular appearance: Some of the win∣dows were under circular arches, others pointed, and all the walling so patched and irregular, that it was not to be distinguished to what age any particular part of it belonged: The congregation had deserted the nave for some years, perhaps from dread of being buried in its ruins, and the chancel alone was used for divine service. Fixed in the south-east corner of the nave was a mount, whereon a stone pulpit formerly stood. The rood-loft remained, being a gallery of wood work a∣cross the church, above the entrance into the chancel, on which were the remains of gaudy painting; here the rood or crucifixion was displayed in ancient times, to∣gether with other paintings or effigies of holy personages; and here also the min∣strels performed their part in the service. In the north wall, cut on a stone which passed quite through it, was that curious inscription mentioned by many writers, and learnedly commented on<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>In the copy of the inscription on which the editor of Camden comments, the addition of a stroke, which is not in the original, occasioned him much trouble, and to reconcile the line not being a numeral, he

<P>The dean and chapter's council were Mr Sol. General, Mr Serj. Wright, Sir W. Williams Sir T. Powis, Mr Dormer, Mr Brown, Mr Turner, Mr Phipps, and Mr Bowes, to shew cause against the decree made the last term, for quieting the plaintiffs in the possession of their franchises, &amp;c. according to the prayer of their bill, and that the defendants may be stopt from erecting any shore or wharf at Jarrow Slake. They thereupon insisted on these three points: 1st, That the court ought to make no decree upon this bill, 2d, That they ought not to grant a perpetual injunction. 3d, That before they make their decree absolute with a perpetual injunction, they ought to grant a new trial, or a reasonable time to make out a right at law.</P>
<P>The rehearsal of these arguments is voluminous, I shall only select the heads of each subject. Newcastle prescribes that no ballast wharf was ever erected at Jarrow: A negative prescription. The thing complained of, is the erection of a public nuisance upon a public navigable river, for which they alledge no special right in themselves but as conservators: Should have prosecuted in the king's name. They make no title to the soil. The decree is to quiet them in all the liberties prescribed to in the bill, the issues related to Jarrow Slake only: The decree would bind the dean and chapter's right in all other parts of the river, and to quiet the plaintiffs in their pretended privileges from Sparhawk to Heddon Streams, fifteen miles. The only ground of their right is the pretended conservatorship; which must be derived from the crown, and that by record, which they shew not. Second general head: The doctrine of perpetual injunctions. They are new, and nothing found of them in our old books. Originated on trials of ejectment, and devised to prevent multiplicity of suits for the same thing. Judge Hale, the oracle of the law, would never confine a man's right to one trial. It was a new notion for courts of equity to lay such fetters upon the common law. Third general head▪ Several cases were cited where new trials were granted, and affidavits of several records being discovered since the trial. Counsel then stated, 1st, That <HI>Newcastle</HI> itself was a corporation within the time of memory, and so incapable of prescribing time beyond memory. That its ancient name was <HI>Monkchester,</HI> and assumed the name of <HI>Newcastle</HI> from the castle built there by William Rufus; was afterwards forfeited by Rob. de Mowbray earl of Northumberland, and remained in the crown till king John granted it, which is time within memory, the time of memory being to be computed from the beginning of the reign of king Richard I. 2d, That commissions of conservatorship have been frequently granted from the crown to the mayor, &amp;c. whereby it appears they acted from time to time under the crown, and so were not conservators by prescription. 3d, That the church of Durham has time beyond memory constantly enjoyed the south side of the river Tyne <HI>usq. ad filum aquae,</HI> or at least a third part of it, and enjoyed the conservatorship on their own side▪ 4th, That ballast wharfs have not been used upon this river for above one hundred years, and so cannot be prescribed to time beyond memory. 5th, That the corporation has claimed them as proprietors of the soil, and not as conservators, &amp;c. Several records were produced and read: 1. A commission of con∣servatorship 45th k. Edw. III. to the mayor and others. 2. Another commission 32d k. Henry VI. directed to the mayor and others for conservatorship of the river inter Sparhawk &amp; Heddon Streams: The very bounds prescribed to in their bill. 3. K.

A record 2d k. Hen. V. shewing that the bishop upon a solemn trial at the King's-bench bar, upon an issue joined before the lord chancellor, and transmitted thither by order of parliament, and tried before a jury of Westmoreland and Cumberland, recovered against the town of New∣castle a third part of Tyne Bridge, <HI>cum franchesiis jurisdictionibus &amp; juribus regatibus.</HI> as also four marks da∣mages for usurping his privileges upon Tyne Bridge, in building the tower on the south side thereof, and re∣moving the two boundering stones called <HI>St Cuthbert's stones:</HI> Whereupon the mayor is adjudged to bring the stones back and lay them where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound them, at his own cost, for perpetual boundaries. By this record the corporation pleads inter alia, that king John and his predecessors, kings of England, were time beyond memory seised of the town of Newcastle, and the whole river of Tine, and the whole bridge, and being so seised granted it to them, whereby it appears they derived their original right from king John, which is time
<PB N="479" REF="507"/>within memory. The dean and chapter's council urged this record as an estopple against their prescribing in themselves. 9. Act of parl. 1<SUP>o</SUP> Mariae, for reuniting the town of Gateshead with the water and bridge to the county palatines jurisdiction, and for repealing the act made 7th king Edw. IV.

A record annexed to the <HI>record, marchiar</HI> giving an account historically how the town of Newcastle and county of Northumberland came to the Mowbrays, and were forfeited by them; of its name of Monkchester and when it took the name of Newcastle. &amp;c. 3. An inspeximus of king John's charter of incorporation to Newcastle, and all their other charters till the time of king Henry VI. whereby it appears they never had the port granted to them as appur∣tenant to it, nor the conservatorship of it. Whereupon the defendant's counsel prayed a new trial. The arguments were long, and would afford little pleasure to the reader, I shall therefore only select such special matters from thence as may seem important. As to the issues being particular to Jarrow Slake, and the decree general to the whole river, the plaintiff's counsel gave no answer. But the lord chief baron wondered how it had crept into the decree, and agreed that the decree could only be particular as to Jarrow Slake. They gave no answer to the objection that the plaintiffs ought to derive their conservatorship from the crown. The chief baron cited many instances of pepetual injunctions; but it was agreed they have been only in use since the reign of king Charles I. As to the records, the plaintiff's counsel alledged, that it did not appear any thing was done under the commissions of conservatorship, or that the mayor of Newcastle ever accepted them; to which it was answered, the acceptance must be presumed, if nothing is shewn to the contrary. As to the 2d article, the record of king Henry I. being of date beyond memory, ought not to be given in evi∣dence, without shewing an allowance of it in eyre: Cases cited to the contrary in answer. 3d article: Op∣posed the reading of it, affirming it to be only an action of trespass prosecuted by the bishop, for trespass done in taking away ships, &amp;c. and being betwixt other parties ought not to be read. This the chief baron over∣ruled, but observed it was a strange sort of commission, being a special commission of oyer and terminer, to hear and determine one particular trespass, which he thought the king himself had not a power to grant.— Mr Dormer answered, that there were special customs in the county palatine different from the common and ordinary customs of the realm, and his lordship's commission when he sat there as judge was <HI>ad audiendum &amp; terminand. secundum legem terrae &amp; consuetud.

The lord chief baron produced his notes, which he had taken upon hearing the cause of king John's charter, whence he observed that king John granted <HI>probis hominibus ejusdem, inter alia. omnes easdem libertates &amp; liberas consuetudines quas habere consueverunt tempore Hen.</HI> 2. <HI>patris nostri:</HI> And said, he looked upon that charter of king John's to be only a charter of confirmation.

<P>Issues were granted and tried. 1. Whether the defendants could lawfully erect and use a ballast key at Jarrow Slake, without the complainant's licence. 2 Whether the erecting such key would be a damage to the river Tyne, or the navigation thereof, or to the port of Newcastle.</P>
<P>Bourne, in his History of Newcastle, p. 164. 17 Mar. 1697, dean and chapter of Durham and Sam. Shep∣herd petitioned and appealed to the house of lords against the decree, 7 Maij, 1698. On hearing counsel it the lords' bar, on the petition and appeal, it was ordained and adjudged that the same be dismissed that house, and the decree confirmed.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="508"/>Bourne, p 172, also says, <Q>In going down the water we meet with several keys, as Winkemley, Bill key, Willington key, Hebbourn key, &amp;c. When the hoastmen renewed their charter, they had licence to send coals above the Bill, and Mr Cole procured a shore at <HI>Friar Goose,</HI> Mr Henry Chapman procured a shore upon <HI>Heworth</HI> grounds, and Mr Rob. Brandling with much ado got leave to build a shore upon his own ground at <HI>Fellin.</HI> In the mean time the tenants of the dean and chapter at Durham took liberty to throw their ashes into the river, which did much damage to the bar. Upon this Mr Leonard Carr and Mr Cuth. Bewick complained, and the town caused them to lay them upon the land, of which they have made mighty heaps. When king James I. came to the crown he was pleased to be bountiful to his country∣men; among the rest Sir Henry Gibb being one of his officers, he bestowed upon him the lordship of Jar∣row, and he would have procured a shore there to cast ballast; but although he had the favour of the king, yet the town used such means and gave such reasons to his majesty and the council, that they found it de∣trimental to the town, and especially to the river, so that he was utterly hindred and disappointed.</Q></P>

<P>The first character has been omitted by all the copyists, which we presume is a compound meant for an invocation, and signifies <HI>Propitietur Deus:</HI> Below the third line the stone is rough, as if it had suffered an obliteration: The whole inscription is in Roman characters except one Saxon ∊ and two square or black letter O's; from whence, and the situation of the stone, one readily determines the inscription to be of equal date with the repairs which were made after the Normans destroyed the monastery, and that it was only a modern memorial of the antiquity of the foundation. Some of the religious had figured the plastering of the north wall, to make the sun-beams from one of the windows serve as a dial to point out the hour of the day. You advance to the chancel under the archings of the tower; the pillars very low, ill proportioned, and square, with capitals remarkably heavy and plain; the arches circular, and without ornament; the dome vaulted with stone and rib'd, the groins rising from the corners, and the ribs uniting in the center: The circumstance of the pillars not standing square, but forming an oblong north and south, was remarkable; the width of this part was only five paces. The tower standing in the center induces us to conclude that formerly this church was in the form of a cross, and it is probable, from outward appearances, that the nave had side ailes. We do not know one instance where the tower stands between the chancel and nave that there is not or anciently was a cross aile, and few have the
<PB N="477" REF="505"/>
tower in that situation but churches of more than ordinary consequence. The length of the chancel from the tower to the altar rails is ten paces, and the width only about five paces, stalled on each side with old carved oak work: The east win∣dow consisted of three lights under a pointed arch. On the north side there were two windows, one under a circular arch, and the other a pointed arch, one win∣dow to the south close by the tower, having also a pointed arch; all which cir∣cumstances shew the edifice had undergone innumerable alterations, and indeed we considered no part so ancient as the tower, which it is presumed was the chief of what remained after the devastation committed by the Normans. We found no remarkable sculptures here save a sepulchral one, which had the figure of a burning taper, with expanded wings. What, was shewn as the greatest curiosity, and is carefully kept in the vestry-room, is a great two-armed chair, said to have been the common seat of Bede, and which has remained there since his time: It is of oak, and appears as rude as if hewn out with an ax, except that at the top of the back the cross piece is mortised to the standards or upright parts, which also serve for legs; these with the seat and sides are very ancient, but the back, according to the information of the person who shewed it, is modern: It is now become very rough and uneven from the superstition of people, who, by carrying away a chip from it, presume they have obtained the saint's protection*.</P>
<P>The haven of Jarrow, now called the Slake, is above half a mile in width, through the middle of which runs the brook called by Leland the Done; this in former times was most probably a powerful rivulet, but as it rises in a coal country may have been greatly diminished, and its feeders drained off<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Inter Majorem &amp; Burgenses Novi Castri sup' Tynam.

<PB N="479" REF="507"/>
ages, is yet a formidable work. Mr Grose, from the appearance of the haven in 1773, says, the situation of the monastery <Q>was not judiciously chosen with
<PB N="480" REF="508"/>
respect to healthfulness, there being a large marshy spot bordering it on the south, and when the tide is out, scarce any thing but stinking ouse remains in the bed of the creek that runs close under it.</Q> It was not so miserable when we saw it, for many acres of the margin of the Slake were beautifully covered with thrift<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The statice armeria of Linnaeus.</NOTE> in full bloom, giving the shores the finest purple hue; and the sands were hard, and afforded pleasant travelling. As we observed before, when the ground was first chosen, this was the royal port where the Northumbrian fleet lay moored; these were the most populous shores, and here was the St Paul's of a powerful nation. A ship of one hundred tons burthen was a large vessel in these parts in the sixteenth century, and such were even brought from abroad, and not constructed here<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Now there were many merchantmen of 3, 4, and 500 tons burthen belonging to several ports, and up∣wards of 100 vessels, each of above 200 tons burthen, belonging to Newcastle alone, all built at home, and better built than elsewhere; and before the death of king James, our trade was so far increased, that in the opinion of Sir William Monson, we were little, if at all, inferior in maritime force to the Dutch. See Camp∣bell's Lives of the Admirals, vol. ii. p. 28. He further adds, that whereas ships of 100 tons had been before esteemed very large vessels, and were generally built and brought from beyond the seas. p. 41.</P></NOTE>: What must we then conceive of the vessels of Egfrid's fleet?</P>

A resi∣dent family in the time of bishop Skirlaw bore the local name, and John de Hethe∣worth, in the twelfth year of that prelate, held divers parcels of land of the prior of Durham by various rents and services, <HI>inter alias</HI> gloves, a pound of cumin, &amp;c. which lands were described, in the inquisition taken on his death, to have been formerly of William the son of Peter de Hetheword, William Fraunceys, John Clerk, Hugh Colstanes and others. <HI>White-House,</HI> belonging to Mr Colville, lies near to High-Heworth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

on the 24th of September, in the first year of bishop Sever, in order to raise cer∣tain trusts and uses therein. The barrenness of the history of places in this dis∣trict, as we before observed, is owing to the ancient monastery to which they were given; and thence they became involved in the general history of the church of Durham; or such as were granted out by the crown, are now in the hands of modern possessors, whose estates are derived from that period.</P>
<P>Descending into this vale, we found the country in a very different mode of agri∣culture from that we had passed: Navigation, trade, and the mines fully occupy the hands of the industrious in the neighbourhood of Gateshead and Whickham. In the valley about Hebborn the lands are laid out in beautiful order, well culti∣vated and planted; new roads are formed, the buildings are improved, and a hap∣py fertility rewards the attention of the owner. Several beautiful mansions, with plantations and pleasure-grounds, ornament the scene; and the greatest part of the country from Gateshead to Shields is remarkably pleasant.</P>
<P>The towns of NORTH and SOUTH SHIELDS lie opposite to each other. Bourne remarks that North-Shields, in the reign of king Edward I. when the contest be∣tween Newcastle and the priory of Tinmouth happened, had only five or six fisher∣men's huts, and was become a large place but of late years, the church having been erected in 1659. South-Shields is also much improved of late years; it is situated on a higher shore, whence it is less affected by the smoke of the several works carried on there, and stands more commodious for keys, ship-builders yards, and many other matters material to trade. On a fine plain a large square is lately built, having the church on the south, with streets branching from the centers of each side of the square, and a handsome town-hall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is also used by the dean and chapter as a court-house: Notice was given to hold a court leet there on Tuesday the 16th of October, 1770, for the whole manor of Westoe.</P>
<P>1729. This year the town of Newcastle had a trial at the assizes with Sir Henry Liddell, about tolls, wherein a verdict was given in favour of Sir Henry. It was then customary for the judges to go in the town's barge, attended by the mayor and others of the corporation, to Tynmouth, in their return this year Mr Justice Page who tried the cause, had some hot words with Mr Reay relative thereto, and thereupon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge threatened to commit the mayor, and the mayor in return told the judge he would commit him, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the water and in his peculiar jurisdiction.

Bishop Trevor granted them a market, to be held weekly on Wednesday, from the 17th of October, 1770, and two yearly fairs on the 24th of June and the 1st of September. Much trade is carried on here; fre∣quently four hundred sail of vessels lie in this haven at a time; ships of such burthen as cannot come up to the Newcastle quays load and unload here: Some branches of trade have decreased of late years, particularly that of salt-boiling, which used to produce a duty of 80,000l. a year, and for some years past has not exceeded 10,000l. About fifty years ago it is said there were two hundred salt pans wrought here, now there are not more than thirty. But whilst that trade has declined, others of great consequence have improved as rapidly; for within the distance of
<PB N="483" REF="511"/>
forty years there were not more than four ships which belonged to this town, and now we are informed there are about five hundred, of between one hundred and five hundred tons burthen: Eleven ships were built and launched from the yards in 1781. There are here three dry docks for repairing, and ten yards for building ships: Four glass-houses for making crown glass and bottles; and it is supposed the number of settled inhabitants is about fifteen thousand. Mr Fordyce erected a large barilla work here, but it did not answer his expectations; some or most of the buildings are now used for a soap-boilery. The victualling and fitting out such a number of ships by the sister towns, as resort to this haven, of which South-Shields has a considerable proportion, the many branches of trade and manufacture carried on there, produce a vast influx of wealth. The importance of South-Shields has arose in little more than a century: The church, a chapel of ease under Jarrow, had occasion to enlarge the burial yard; and, in 1631, bishop Howson consecrated a plot of ground for that purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In MS. Church, p. 895. Ordonatio, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The great increase of inhabitants is shewn by the tables in the notes.</P>
<P>The antiquity of the church at Shields is not to be deduced with accuracy from any records before us; it was perhaps nearly cotemporary with that of Jarrow: Little can be gathered from the structure, it has been so often altered and reform∣ed. The nave is twenty-eight paces in length, having to the south an aile, formed by five short round pillars with plain capitals, supporting pointed arches, apparent∣ly of a more modern date than the columns; the four arches eastward are uni∣form, but the two to the west much loftier, and of a different model: The width of the nave and south aile is eleven paces: The aile on the north side is new, erect∣ed in 1753, and six paces wide; the pillars are square, and arches circular, neatly stuccoed: It is galleried above the whole length, and regularly stalled below: There is also a gallery at the west end, and three small ones in the south aile: The church is plastered throughout, and ceiled with plain stucco-work: The place or recess for the communion-table is in the modern fashion, without any chancel, six paces wide, and lighted with a large Venetian window. The pulpit is fixed against the second pillar in the south row. The vestry room is remarkably neat, and the whole edifice kept in decent order<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Penes Rev.

a fine point of land, are particularly beautiful: But that from the ropery-walk ex∣cels every thing of the kind in the north of England. The river thronged with vessels, and animated with an incessant passage of small craft, is close on your left hand: The batteries and barracks on the northern shore display a striking military scene, whilst on the more distant ground, from the brow of lofty rocks, rise the venerable remains of Tinmouth priory: At the time we saw this prospect, the cliffs were gilded with the evening sun; the dashing billows which broke over the bar of the river drove their foam against the precipices, over which the solemn abbey, in the weeds of ruin, with distracted aspect, sinking under the destroying hand of Time, compleated such an assemblage of picturesque objects as seldom are found in a space so confined.</P>
<P>Bourne, speaking of the river Tyne, says, <Q>The mouth of the river forms a haven so deep as to carry vessels of a considerable burthen, and of that security that they are not in danger either of storms or shallows, save that within less than half a mile of the bar of Tinmouth (which is a sand that lies cross the river's mouth, not above seven feet deep at low water) you meet with many rocks, which are called by the sailors the Black Middens, which are very dan∣gerous; but to prevent any mischiefs which might happen in the night time, there are two light-houses, maintained by the Trinity-house in Newcastle; and near them, in the year 1672, was built a fort called Clifford's fort, which effec∣tually commands all the vessels that enter the river.</Q></P>
<P>Many judicious antiquaries have been of opinion, that there was a Roman station at the point of land near South-Shields; and indeed the importance of this river was such, that we can scarcely imagine so cautious and intelligent a people would have neglected the southern shore, where an enemy's troops at some seasons might safely be disembarked if the coast was unguarded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Horsley's Brit. Rom. p. 286. There has been a Roman station here, and to this belong the three fol∣lowing antiquities.</P>
<P>An altar was (when I took the draught of it) upon the spot where the station has been, lying at the north∣west corner. Dr Hunter has since got it removed to the library of Durham, where I saw it, when last there.</P>
<P>It is of a coarse brown stone, much of the same nature with what we frequently meet with in other Roman altars; though the people here tell me, no such stone is now to be found in these parts The usual sacrifi∣cing vessels are upon the sides of the altars, and the knife upon the back, which is not so common.— There has no doubt been an inscription upon this altar, though it is now entirely effaced. Yet as this was the only original I could recover belonging to this station, I thought proper to give a draught of it.</P>
<P>Besides this, two other altars have been found at this place; one of which, as I am informed, was built up in a quay wall about forty years ago, and is not now to be come at. The other was first sent to York to Dr Lister, and since his death, as I have been told, was sent to Norwich to one Mr Giles, and I suppose is now lost. Dr Lister published it in the Transactions, N<SUP>o</SUP> 145, and from thence it has been inserted in Camden's Brit. and in Dr Gale's edition of Antonine's Itinerary, p. 9.</P>
<Q>Dis Matribus pro salute Imperatoris Marci Aurelii Antonini Augusti Pii felicis — lubens merito ob reditum.</Q>
<P>I have taken the draught of the altar and inscription from the copy of Dr Lister, compared with the others, and given a reading of the inscription somewhat different from Dr Lister's, and only pricked those letters or parts of letters which I imagine ought to be supplied. As it is not usual to place the word <HI>Imperator</HI> after the name of the emperor, so I see no occasion for doing it here. The Doctor observes, that this altar might be erected for Caracalla when going into Caledonia. Severus is, I believe, generally joined to Caracalla in the inscriptions before the Caledonian expedition, as he was in the expedition itself. This makes it less pro∣bable that Caracalla is intended in the inscription, and yet <HI>ob reditum,</HI> and the titles <HI>pii felicis</HI> don't seem to suit Marcus Aurelius, nor <HI>ob reditum</HI> Commodus, though to him <HI>pius felix</HI> are usually annexed. So that I suppose it yet more improbable, that either of these are intended. Nor do I think there is much in having both <HI>pro salute,</HI> and <HI>ob reditum</HI> in the inscription. It is for his safe return: <HI>Pro salute itus et reditus</HI> is not un∣common.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Extract from Professor Ward's letter to Mr Horsley, page 351.</HEAD>
<P>Dr Lister, who first wrote out this inscription, and from whose copy the others have since been taken, tells us, that it contained nine lines, and therefore has left a space between the fifth and sixth line sufficient to con∣tain two others. In this space, the names of the person who erected the altar might probably be inserted.— And as it appears by the Doctor's draught, that the inscription filled up the whole space of the altar, it is scarce credible to me so great a chasm should be left between LV and BENS. I cannot but think therefore, that a letter or two are wanting here, which may have been LI in LIBENS, and that SO might have been at the end of the preceding line, which joined to L at the beginning of this, would stand for <HI>solvit,</HI> as V that fol∣lows may be <HI>votum.</HI> This is agreeable to the usual form, <HI>solvit votum libens merito,</HI> suits the space, and ren∣ders the inscription complete.</P>

<P><Q>Give me leave to attempt the recovery of one of the Roman stations in this country, both requisite for the security of the navigation into the northern seas, and the protection of their frontiers beyond the river Tyne, thereby saving the great expence and trouble of building the wall as far as the sea at Tinmouth, no less than three miles. I mean that near South-Shields, at the entrance of the river into the ocean, and which cannot but have flourished till the Danish in∣vasions, as Mr Leland has it in his Collectanea, vol. iv. p. 43. <HI>E regione Tine∣muthae fuit urbs vastata a Danis, Urfa nomine, ubi natus erat Oswinus rex.</HI> The communication there was with Binchester, is visible in several places, as is the angle where the paved way goes off from the military way leading to Lanchester, about three miles to the north of Binchester, and passes to the north east through Brancepeth-park, thence a little to the south of Brandon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Behind Willington the road is very distinct: A mile stone was lately discovered there, with an inscrip∣tion described to be legible; but when we went to look after it, the farmers had totally obliterated the whole, and squared the pillar to form some part of the sold for their cattle.</P>

Two elevated pavements in the river Tyne, the one at the west end of South-Shields, the other on the north side of the river, near the end of the Roman wall, proper for their safe landing at different times of the ebbing and flowing tide, fully shew its necessary correspondence with <HI>Segedunum,</HI> the first station upon the wall. But another military way called <HI>Wreken Dyke</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>That there has been a Roman station at South-Shields is out of all question; the altars that have been found there, and the military way which has gone from it, are convincing proofs of this. I once imagined
<PB N="487" REF="515"/>this station might have been the old <HI>Glanoventa</HI> (which no doubt was the most easterly on this rout at that time) mentioned in the Itinerary and in the Notitia, and that this iter had begun here, and proceeded accord∣ing to the military way leading from hence to Lanchester: But the distances in the Itinerary are not to be re∣conciled to the distances between the respective stations on this way, if we begin at South-Shields. Besides, that the slender remains of the station and military way near it, incline me to think it has not been mention∣ed so late as till the writing of the Notitia, that it was in being at the time of Marcus Aurelius, appears from the altar and inscription found here, if Dr Lister's reading be just; but I am apt to think it was abandoned not very long after, perhaps at the building of Severus's wall, and the station erected at Cousin's house, or a little after. This station seems not to be named either in Ptolemy, the Itinerary, or Notitia, unless we sup∣pose <HI>Ostia Vedrae</HI> in Ptolemy to be as well the name of the station as of the river mouth.</P>
<P>I know no other name for the Roman station and town at the mouth of the river, (<HI>Vedra</HI> Tine) near South-Shields, but <HI>Ostia Vedrae.</HI> If we consider the station itself, the altar inscribed to one of the Antonines, and the nearness of the place to the Roman wall, one can scarce suppose, that the river and station should be wholly unknown to Ptolemy; and yet unless these be their names, they are nameless in this geographer. I own the force of this argument is abated, when we consider, that neither Newcastle nor any other of the Ro∣man places on the wall are mentioned by this ancient author; but it is true, that towns rather than sorts came under Ptolemy's notice.</P>
<P>In this place it will not be amiss to take notice of Wreken Dyke, the military way so called. This military way has no doubt terminated at South-Shields. It seems to have come from the station, and to have crossed the marsh, then possibly a branch of the river, not far from the station. Thence it has passed most probably through, or a little to the east of a house called Lay-gate; from thence it seems to have gone near a house called the Barns, the garden wall probably standing on it, and so on to the Dean bridge, close by Jar∣row Slake. For this space, the traces of this way are very obscure and uncertain: In the field beyond this bridge the track of it is plain, and for near the full breadth of the inclosure, sensibly raised above the level of the rest of the ground, though it runs cross the ridges. On the west side of this field or inclosure there is a small descent, and in the bottom a lane, which is the high road from Bowden to Shields, and a small ascent on the other side in the field joining this lane. As the military way ascends on the one side and descends on the other, it is bent into a curve, and then falls into the right line, in which it seems to be continued all the way to Gateshead fell for the space of five or six miles; from thence it goes towards Lamesley and Kibbles∣worth, which it leaves a little to the south. It was very visible all the way not many years ago, before Sir Henry Liddell inclosed and improved those grounds. And the gardener at Cousin's house, who formerly wrought on Gateshead fell, assured me he had seen and helped to dig up some stones out of Wreken Dyke, which he called Bracken Dyke, so that he was altogether of opinion that this part of it had been paved. This way passes on towards Beamish, and I make no doubt has gone forward to Lanchester. It is indeed lost on the moor beyond Beamish, nor is it any great wonder it should be so, considering how mossy and lost it is. I was assured at Lanchester that several trees had been dug up in this moor, which had been cut down with an ax, probably to clear this way; and if these trees have been sunk so much below the surface, no wonder if a heavy military way be much more so. I have heard a traditionary account of this way's passing by Stan∣ley towards Lanchester, though I know not how far this may be relied on, but how little of such military ways appear in some other places, where it might have been better expected? There is a remarkable tumulus near this way, not far from Ravensworth: Besides which, I observed another very considerable one about a mile from Lanchester, called the Maiden-Law, and probably the military way has not been far from this tu∣mulus. I am surprised to find the military way which goes from South-Shields usually represented to pass near to Durham, sometimes on the east and sometimes on the west side of it, when there is such plain de∣monstration not only of the reality of the way, but of the range and tendency of it; but I believe the military way which is supposed to have gone from Newcastle to Chester, and from thence to Watling-street near Bin∣chester, has occasioned the mistake. The Gardener at Cousin's house, said he had observed when he wrought thereabouts, this military way from Newcastle to Chester, and that it lay to the west of the present high∣way through the sell. Dr Hunter was positive he had observed the same way upon the sell, as also some re∣maining track of a <HI>via vicinalis</HI> beyond Chester, between Binchester and Brancepeth castle, (as I remember) pointing towards Chester, which he therefore concluded must have gone that way.—<HI>Horsley.</HI></P>
<P>1750. Wreken Dyke is the boundary between Gateshead fell and Eighton common, and may be seen as it passes through Eighton quarries, and at the north end of the village of Eighton, from thence down one of lord Ravensworth's new inclosures, and crossing the high road leading to Newcastle from Chester, it appears plain in an inclosure on the west side of the road, the ridge not having been ploughed, and it is partly over run with broom, and there is a foot path on the ridge of it.</P>

<P>Mr Horsley's remarks on the etymology of Wreken Dyke.—<HI>Ichning</HI> or <HI>Icknild</HI> seems sometimes to have been corrupted into <HI>Ricknild</HI> or <HI>Richning,</HI> as appears from the names of some places that are supposed to be derived from the name of this street. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Drayton. in his Polly-Olbion, brings in Watling-street as speaking thus:</L>

From the like conjecture one might be inclined to think, that <HI>Ravens worth</HI> is from <HI>Romans worth;</HI> for the village of Ravensworth is just by the military way, though the castle be at some distance. But I know no better conjecture with respect to this etymology than that it has been from <HI>Warken Dyke</HI> or <HI>Wrought Dyke,</HI> that is a dyke of great labour and work, according to our northern pronunciation. It consists of firm gravel and sand, very hard and compact, so as to make a very good way at this time, at all seasons of the year. I also believe it has a mixture of stone or somewhat of pavement.</P>

fell, where it passed the public road, and a little to the west the Roman way going to the south from Newcastle to Chester-in-the-Street, and afterwards run∣ing through Lamesley and Kibblesworth fields, advances to the south-west over Blackburn moor, and through the township of Hedley. It comes next to Cau∣sey, a village which owes its name to it, and from thence ascends a high hill, and terminates at a square fortification upon the top thereof at Stanley, the seat of the Hon. Sir Nich. Tempest, bart. who, I am told, possesses several Roman coins found therein. This place, though not above three miles from Chester-in-the-Street and four from Lanchester, seems to have had no immediate communica∣tion with either of them, no vestigia of any paved way appearing upon the moors adjoining, and being situated as Chester itself, at the termination of a military way, gives me convincing reason to believe the use of each has been the same, namely, to guard herds of cattle at grass, for the subsistence of the two garrisons at South-Shields and <HI>Pons Aelij,</HI> and for victualling ships resorting to the first place: Whereas had its elevated situation been intended to form a <HI>castrum ex∣ploratorium,</HI> then must the advantage of paved ways to the next station have been necessary for the speedy conveyance of intelligence. Though this last mi∣litary way bears the names of Wreken Dyke, I am apt to believe that name is rather due to the way leading from Binchester to South Shields, especially from the authority of Ralph Higden, who says, that Wreken Dyke, or Reken Dyke, passed from the west of England and ended at Tinemouth. I dare not affix a Roman name to this our station, without the authority of inscriptions.</Q></P>
</LETTER>
<P>After the learned definitions given in the notes on the etymology of Wreken Dyke, it may appear presumptuous to offer new conjectures; but there is a proba∣bility that this military road was restored by the Danes on their making the river Tyne their frequent harbour, for the more easy communication with the country, and victualling their navy: At their several stationary intervals where sentries were placed, their standard, so well known in ancient writings by the name of
<PB N="489" REF="517"/>
Raffen, would be displayed, and it seems but a small trespass on the original word, to imagine it would fall into the corruption of <HI>Raken,</HI> so as to make Raffen Dyke sound Racken Dyke: They were the last people who it may be presumed kept this up as a military road, and thence the name in acceptation in their days, not having been disused by new comers, has remained to our time. We proposed the like etymology for the name of Ravensworth, much less corrupted from Raf∣fens-weath, the northern language, and it remains with the reader to determine, whether, supported by each other, together with the tumuli of Ravensworth and Maiden Law, the conjecture is probable, or at least not altogether vague.</P>

The chancel is separated from the nave by railings and stalls, being six paces in length to the altar rails; the windows have been regular, two to the north and two to the south under pointed arches; one is new sashed: The east window con∣sists of three lights under a pointed arch. The vestry room is singular, and its original use not now to be discovered; it is vaulted over with stone, with ribbed archings terminating in points, and seems as if it was constructed for a place of interment. On the south side of the church is a large porch, called the Lord's porch, about twenty feet long and fifteen broad, now claimed as the burial place of the family of <HI>Bracks;</HI> it is ceiled with wood in pannels, gaudily painted, sprinkled over with golden stars, and further ornamented with the arms of the fa∣mily of James; in one shield the See of Durham is quartered <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>On a wooden tablet.</HI> WILL.

<P>Burials in the last year 64.—Computed number of inhabitants 1920.</P></NOTE>. Mr Stonhewer, whilst he was rector between the years 1719 and 1727, built a good rectory house; but the present elegant mansion appears, by the arms over the door, to owe its erection or great improvements to Mr Talbot, afterwards bishop of Durham.</P>
<P>GREAT USWORTH in this parish is the seat of William Peareth, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> an ele∣gant newly erected mansion, on the southern inclination of a hill, and in a lofty situation: The building is of free-stone, in a good taste; the center, containing the

chief apartments, has an hexagonal projection; the offices form the wings. The prospect is extensive and beautiful, having Biddick, Lambton, Harraton, and the Staiths in front, a long tract of country eastward, and an open view of the sea, with Sunderland, Weremouth, Hilton castle, and the borders of the river Were.</P>

with xxvj men; and it was therein specified, that the service theretofore perform∣ed at Washington they were to do at Gateshead; also to carry a tun of wine and millstones to Durham. A dringe fed a horse and a dog, and attended the great chace, providing two greyhounds and five cords of provender; he followed the court and went on embassies. In the fifth year of bishop Hatfield, Alicia Bedik was seised of two parts of the vill of Great Usworth, rendering yearly fifty shillings and eight-pence rent, three quarters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eight bush. to the quarter.</NOTE> and half a quarter of barley malt, called <HI>stat∣malt,</HI> or statute or stated malt, the like quantity of oat-meal, called <HI>statmele,</HI> and seven quarters of oats, called <HI>stathavire</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. 5 bishop Hatfield, cor. vic. ap.

It appears by an inquisition in the thirty-fifth year of the same prelate, that Alicia intermarried with Rich. Stanhop.

<P>The manor of LITTLE USWORTH in the Boldon Book rendered x s. yearly, and William who possessed it, carried the bishop's wine with eight oxen, and attended the great chace with two greyhounds.

In the thirty-fourth year of bishop Hatfield, Isabella the daughter of Tho. de Wessington, daughter and one of the heiresses of Jacob de Usworth, died seised of a moiety of this manor, and a fourth part of the vill of Great Usworth. In the sixteenth year of bishop Skirlaw we find Gerard Heron <ABBR>esq</ABBR> seised of a moiety of the manor, in right of Elizabeth
<PB N="493" REF="521"/>
his wife, and that Johan de Riddell held the other moiety, they being daughters and coheiresses of Cecily Taillior. Much confusion appears in the inquisitions from this period, by the manor passing in moieties to females; and we find the fa∣milies of Wessington, Redmarshall, Dolphanby, Swynhoes, and Chestre severally in∣terested therein.</P>
<P>NORTH BIDDICK belongs to the family of Davisons, and lies in a low situation, within a mile of Washington: It is mentioned in the Boldon Book as the property of Ulkill, who held it by the sixth part of a knight's fee. In Hatfield's Survey it appears William de Hilton, knight, held this vill, which theretofore had been the estate of John de Yheland, from which period it continued in the family of Hiltons for many generations, as before observed of their other possessions.

<P>The Staiths called FATFIELD STAITHS exhibit a busy scene in the coal trade, where the keels come up to receive their loading for the port of Sunderland. The village is very populous. Near this place is an eminence called the Worm Hill, which tradition says was once possessed by an enormous serpent, that wound its hor∣rid body round the base; that it destroyed much provision, and used to infest the Lambton estate, till some hero of that family engaged it, cased in armour set with razors, and when it would have crushed the combatant by enfolding him, sustain∣ing a thousand wounds, fell at last by his falchion. We thought to have found intrenchments round this mount, and that the fable had reference to some Danish troop who kept the place as a station, from whence they could commit depreda∣tions on the country, and that the story of the hero imported some chief person∣age's victory over a public enemy: But there is not the least trace of any such matter, and the whole miraculous tale has no other evidence than the memories of old women. Our map makers have figured the place very significantly.</P>

of whom there were twenty-two in Boldon. The cotmanni or cottagers wrought only two days in each week. The pinder here held twelve acres of land in right of his office, and had a thrave of corn from every carucate of land, rendering to the lord yearly twenty-four hens and five hundred eggs: The whole vill paid seventeen shillings cornage, and provided a milch cow for the household. The demesne lands were in farm, and rendered rent in grain, as bread, corn, oats, and barley. In Hatfield's Survey we find the names of the free tenants, among whom is John Hedworth, who served on the bishop's embassies, and was bound to bring up to Durham the bishop's rents of his manor of Werehall. Peter del Hay held lands, and the lord Neville had the vill of Newton. The bond services vary a little from those set forth in Boldon Book; there are malt-pennys and bathe-sylver mentioned: This is the first time the bathe-sylver has occured in the progress of the work, and it is difficult to ascertain what it was. Buthena is defined to im∣ply a park for cattle, and bothena a barony, lordship, or sheriffwick; whether it applied to either of these, we confess ourselves at a loss; perhaps it was stallage-money for the booths or stalls allowed to many of the villains at St Cuthbert's fairs in the city.</P>
<P>In bishop Bury's time, Alicia de Marrays died seised of lands in West Boldon; and Allan Gategant held certain lands there called Fadreless Houses, held <HI>in capite</HI> by homage and fealty. By an inquisition taken on the death of Richard de Hethe∣worth, or Hedworth, in the second year of bishop Fordham, it appears he died seised of various tenements in Boldon, viz. Scots House and all the lands and tenements that theretofore belonged to Ade Rhodes, Gilbert de Boldon, Roger de Burdon, Ambrose de Southwyk, Ade de Clevedon, and Matilda Gray. This fa∣mily retained their possessions in Boldon for many generations. The family of Claxtons held lands there called Strothers-field, touching which, in the time of bishop Neville, Ralph earl of Westmoreland came and claimed oyer of an inquisi∣tion taken by the escheator on the death of William Claxton, wherein Strother∣field in West Boldon, was found to be held of the bishop <HI>in capite,</HI> and by others

It appears that the coro∣ner's fee or stipend arose by produce of lands assigned in ancient times; for we find on the 13th of October, second king Edward VI. it was ordered and decreed by Robert Hyndmer, chancellor of this county palatine, that the tenants and in∣habitants of Whitburn, Cledon, Holdon, and Boldon, should yearly from thence∣forth pay the coroner for the time being his corn in sheaf, as it had been ac∣customed in times past, unless they could otherwise agree with the coroner <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

Newton, in bishop Bury's time, gave a local name to a resident family, and Rob. de Newton, in the fifth year of that prelate, died seised of considerable property there. In bishop Hatfield's Survey it appears, that lord Neville then held the vill, one moiety of which he purchased of William son of Tho.

<P><PB N="500" REF="528"/>In Boldon Book and Hatfield's Survey Clevedon or Cleadon is annexed to Whitburn, as joint members of the same manor: The manor being the bishop's, was in farm, and therein were twenty-eight villains, who held lands and performed services similar to those of Boldon. In the Boldon Book we find the names of Ketellus and John de Whitbern, with others, holding lands there: There were twelve cottagers in the like servitude as those of Boldon, and the pinder had the same privilege. The two vills paid 30s. cornage rent, and provided the houshold with two milch cows. In the survey among the free tenants are the names of several, particularly Hugo de Gilmore, Robert Hedworth, and Reginald War∣mouth, holding considerable possessions. In the inquisitions <HI>post mortem,</HI> of bishop Bury's time, others are described as holding <HI>in capite,</HI> as Matilda de Stafforth, who had lands at Cleadon, and John Correy the like, who left a daughter Stigreda, his heiress.

<P>St Bega, we are told by Bede, founded a religious society at Monkweremouth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Soon after the year 650.</NOTE>; she had instituted a monastery in Copeland, in the district of Cumberland, but what induced her to quit the western coast, for the stormy and boisterous shore of the German ocean, we are not told. Particularly attached to maritime situations, when she moved from Weremouth, she built another religious house for the holy sisterhood at Heorthu, now Hartlepool; being of a restless temper, this third foun∣dation could not satisfy her, but she passed southward, and sat down near Tad∣caster. It is said she was born in Ireland, and received the veil from bishop Aidan, being the first female who made the religious vow in the territories of Northum∣berland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Ex vita S.

In the fourth year of king Egfrid, A.

Lambard, p. 400, speaks thus of him and his undertaking <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Bede, lib. iv. cha. 18, gives the following account of this matter. <Q>In the reign of Egfrid. king of Northumberland, one Benedict, an Englishman, came over from Rome, with John the precenter of St Peter's, who was sent by pope Agatho to the synod convened by The sorus, and he built the monastery of Weremouth, becoming abbot there. Having a grant from the king of some lands for an endowment of the abbey, he went to Rome and procured the pope's bull for a further security in the year 680. At his return the pope ordered John the precentor to go along with him, and teach him and his monks the man∣ner of singing used at St Peter's in Rome. John, at his coming hither, performed this part of his commis∣sion, taught the monastery church music, and pricked out a course for the choir for a whole year. This manner of church music was quickly spread through most part of the kingdom of Northumberland.</Q></P></NOTE>: <Q>This man labour∣ed

to Rome five several tymes, for what other thinge I find not, save only to procure pope holye priviledges, and curious ornaments for his monasteries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jarrow and Weremouth.</NOTE>; for first he gotte for theise houses, wherein he nourished 600 monks, great li∣berties; then brought he them home from Rome painters, glasiers, freemasons, and singers, to th' end that his buildinges might so shyne with workmanshipe, and his churches so sounde with melodye, that simple soules ravished therewithe, should fantasie of theime nothinge but heavenlye holynes: In this jolitie conti∣nued theise houses, and other by theire example embraced the like, till Hinguar and Hubba, the Danish pyrates, (A.

Benedict in the notes. In Bentham's History of Ely, p. 21, we are informed the workmen employed in this edifice were brought by Benedict from France, and that within the compass of a year after the foundation was laid, he caused the roof to be put on, and divine service to be performed in it: He continues, <Q>Af∣terwards, when the building was finished, he sent over to France for artificers skilled in the mystery of making glass, (an art till that time unknown to the inhabitants of Britain) to glaze the windows both of the porticos and principal parts of the church; which work they not only executed, but taught the Eng∣lish nation that most useful art.</Q> We are not informed in what manner the monastery was restored, or by whom, after the Danish devastations; but when king Malcolm of Scotland made his inroad in the year 1070, he ravaged many parts of this palatinate, and burnt the monasteries of Weremouth and Hartlepool. We have few accounts of the ostium of the Were being frequented by shipping in these early times, but from the choice of situations, are induced to believe what led the founders of religious houses to fix upon Weremouth and Jarrow, was their being the station of mariners, who in all ages were objects for religious reforma∣tion; and yet another and perhaps not less essential cause occurs, they were ac∣customed to present gifts for propitiation, which would assist the maintenance, if not increase the riches, of the religious societies. When Malcolm made that pro∣gress, he found Edgar with his family and followers embarked, and lying in the haven waiting wind and tide, for their voyage to Scotland; and it is more than probable the king's intention was to cover that retreat. This circumstance shews that the port was of some note in the eleventh century <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Vide vol. i. p. 108.</P>
<P>Scala Chronica.—<BIBL><HI>Lel. Col. vol. ii. p.</HI> 531.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. It is wonderful that Turgot, who took the monkish habit at this place, should not speak of its history during so long a space of time, as from the incursion of the Danes to the year 1075, a period of 205 years, or mention the restored edifice, the return of the society, and the destruction made by Malcolm. Thus dark as the long interval remains, we must pursue the facts which he delivers down: Part of the religious society of Jarrow (which we are apt to conceive was become too numerous by the monks who were driven from Weremouth seeking refuge there) determined to form a colony, with Aldwin at their head, and settle in the north, whilst another prepared for a southern settlement, headed by Renfred: Aldwin, with his followers, sat down at the ruined huose of Melros, where they suffered much persecution, refusing to swear allegiance to Malcolm, who then possessed that territory <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide vol. i. p. 115. Also Jarrowe.</NOTE>. Bishop Walcher
<PB N="504" REF="532"/>
was displeased with this emigration, which was not only made without his consent, but also militated against a plan he had formed, though not made public: He dis∣patched messengers to entreat the return of the northern colony, and wrote letters of invitation; but in case of disobedience, the messengers were charged with more rigorous commands, and the terrors of excommunication were directed to be an∣nounced. On Aldwin's return to this diocese, in the year 1075, the bishop placed him at Weremouth. Turgot then tells us <Q>Tunc ecclesiam S. Petri, cujus adhuc soli parietes semiruti steterant, succisis arboribus, cradicatis vepribus &amp; spinis, quae totam occupaverant, curarunt expurgare, &amp; culmine imposito, quale hodie cernitur, ad agenda divinae laudis officia stategerant restaurare.</Q> <Q>Ubi de virgis facientes habitacula, &amp;c.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 203, 204, &amp;c.</NOTE> This relation affords some surprise, for according to other authorities, it was only in the year 1070 that Malcolm laid his destroying hand on those edifices, and in the space of five years few trees, thorns, or briers could grow over the ruins. Lambard still creates greater confusion in the matter, who says, <Q>Aldwyn of Evesham, or Winchecombe as others say, accompanied with two or thre other, toke the place of byshop Walchers guifte, covered the churche, and some∣what repaired the house, and stoared it with companie: But before they had longe rested theare, the destruction which William the Conquerour made in the north countrye, and the fire of Malcolme kinge of Scottes came upon theim, and caused theim to forsake the place for a season. And when they ment to have returned, William, then bishop of Durham, compelled them to come to Durham abbay, and made the house and cell subject to the same,</Q> &amp;c. This account destroys every degree of chronology, for bishop Walcher did not come to the See till 1072. To solve the difficulty, it seems likely there were two religious edifices, one north of Were, destroyed by the Danes, of which Jarrow was a filia∣tion, and another erected perhaps after that destruction, on the south of Were, which Malcolm ruined: And this conjecture is not totally groundless; for Tanner, in his Notitia <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Under the title Bishopweremouth.</P>
<P>Tanner's Notitia, p. 14. King Egfrid gave this town to the famous abbot Benedict Biscopius, who, A. D. 674, founded a monastery here, and dedicated it to St Peter. It suffered in the Danish wars, and was burnt down in the inroad made by Malcolm king of Scotland, A. D. 1070: But was afterwards begun to be re∣edified by Walcher bishop of Durham, whose successor William de Carilepho <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Lel.

D. 1083, removed most of the monks to Durham, to which Weremouth became a cell for three or four Benedictine monks.</P>
<P>Complete History of Durham, p. 619. Bede calls it Wiranmuth, now commonly called Monkweremouth, because it lies at the mouth of the river, and before the Reformation belonged to the monks. William of Malmsbury writes thus of it: <Q>The Were flowing into the sea here, kindly receives the ships that are brought in with a gentle wind; upon <HI>each bank whereof</HI> Benedict Bishop built a church, and likewise in the same places founded two monasteries, one to St Peter another to St Paul.</Q> The author of the ad∣ditions to Camden charges this quotation out of Malmsbury with a mistake, and says, our historians all a∣gree, that he built St Peter's church at Girwy or Jarrow, which is some miles distant from this place, but does not produce their words.</P></NOTE>, makes a mistake in the situation of St Peter's, perhaps through the confusion there appears in ancient history. After this last settlement the bishop gave the vill of Weremouth, with Sudwick, for the maintenance of the re∣ligious fellowship there; but their residence was soon disturbed, by bishop William de Carilepho carrying into effect the design of his predecessor, and removing the Be∣nedictine

monks to Durham, in the year 1083; from which period Weremouth became a cell for three or four monks only of that order, subordinate to the mo∣nastery of Durham. Prior Richard de Claxton, resigning his government of the monastery, had assigned for maintenance the cell of Weremouth, with the tithes of Sudwick; and prior Galfrid de Burdon, in the year 1332, had that cell assigned him, with the tithes of Fulwell. At the dissolution, the whole revenues did not, according to the utmost estimate, amount to more than 26l. 9s. 9d. yearly; and in the thirty-seventh year of king Henry VIII. the rights of the monastery were granted out to one Thomas Whitehead <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It was valued, 26th Hen.

<P><PB N="506" REF="534"/>There are several remains of the monastic buildings, which form three sides of a square, with the church; but none of the offices can be ascertained from the edifice now standing. The present church consists only of the nave and north aile, the south aile having been totally destroyed: The tower is most ancient, and probably has stood from the eleventh century, being supported on heavy and low arches, and the chancel is divided from the nave by a heavy circular arch, much like the arches of Jarrow in form, but more lofty and extended: The north aile is formed by two round pillars and three pointed arches, and the east window of the chancel is under a pointed arch, and formed of five lights. The nave is remarkably nar∣row in proportion to its length, being little more than five paces wide, and twenty-two long; the aile is also five paces wide. On the north wall of the chancel is a monument of the Hilton family <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arms: Hiltons quartering the arms of Musgrave.</NOTE>; and in an adjoining porch, is the mutilated effigy of a man in a coat of mail, with elevated hands, and a sword sheathed at his left side, which appears to have belonged to the monument before noted.</P>

<P>Gentleman's Mag. Oct. 1763. "A few weeks ago a gentleman from Durham shewed me some large teeth and two Roman coins. The teeth he said he took out of the jaw of a gigantic skeleton of a man, and the coins were found in the grave near it. The account he gives is in the substance as follows. Upon Ful∣well hills, near Monkweremouth, within a measured mile of the sea, there are quarries of lime which he rents of the proprietor. In the year 1759 he removed a ridge of lime-stone and rubbish, upon one of these quar∣ries, which was about twenty-five yards in length from east to west, its perpendicular height about a yard and a half, its breadth at the top was near six yards, and the sides were sloping like the ruins of a rampart. In the middle of this bank was found the skeleton of a human body, which measured nine feet six inches in length; the shin bone measuring two feet three inches from the knee to the ankle; the head lay to the west, and was defended from the superincumbent earth by four large flat stones, which the relater, a man of great probity, who was present when the skeleton was measured, and who himself took the teeth out of the jaw, saw removed. The coins were found on the south side of the skeleton, near the right hand.</P>

Sir Richard died on the 16th of June, 1755. The castle of Hilton and almost all the rest of the family estates, were decreed to be sold for payment of the debts of John Hilton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> in Sir Richard's life-time. This manor, with the castle, and about 900l. a year in lands, in 1758, were sold to Mr Wogan the younger, then lately returned from the East-Indies, for 30,000l. and upwards, but that sale not being perfected, the estates were pur∣chased by Mrs Bowes, relict of George Bowes of Gibside, <ABBR>esq</ABBR></P>
<P>HILTON CASTLE, seated in a vale on the river Were, is graced with many hanging woods and ornamental plantations, in long extended avenues; and though possessing few beauties of situation, and much shut up from prospect, yet may be justly called a pleasing retirement. Part of the ancient baronial house re∣mains, but it has undergone such reformations and changes, that it is now difficult to ascertain the date of any distinct part of the present edifice. The center of the west front consists of the great entrance and gateway, defended by square project∣ing turrets, crowned with hanging parapets which cross the angles transversly, like those on the old towers at Lumley, so as to make an aperture over each face of the square, for the purpose of annoying assailants. This form indicates that those parts of the two castles were nearly of the same date. The center is flanked with circular turrets, which now garnish the wings of the building, of modern construc∣tion: The battlements of the ancient part are ornamented with human figures. In the center are several shields of arms, but disposed so irregularly as to testify the present building did not first receive them. In the highest place are the royal arms, three fleur-de-lis quartering three lions passant, and beneath, in a confused form, are the arms of Graystoke, Lumley, Brabant, Percy, Ogle, Conyers, and several others. On the turrets are several shields of arms, among which are those of Surtees and Bowes. The east front has the ancient tower in the center, with a square projecting front without turrets. It is ornamented with the arms of the Hiltons, without quarterings, the head of Moses the crest; above which is a large

<P>We have a description of this castle in the rolls of bishop Nevil, about the year 1450, when it consisted of a hall, four chambers, a chapel, two barns, a kitchen, and a house called the gate house. The present center of the building is five stories in height, and most probably is the edifice described in the record, comprehending the hall and four chambers. The family of Hilton was not only one of the most eminent in this province, but also one of the most opulent, as appears by their possessions mentioned in the notes.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="539"/>The following account of the Hiltons is taken from a manuscript in the posses∣sion of the Musgraves of Hayton:</P>
<P><Q>Three hundred years before the Conquest, even in the reign of king Athelstan, one of the Saxon monarchs, the family of Hyltons were settled in England in great reputation, as appears by a certain inscription at Hartlepool. That upon the coming over of William the Conqueror, Lancelot de Hylton, with his two sons Henry and Robert, espoused his cause and joined him; but that Lancelot was slain at Feversham in Kent. That to the elder son Henry, the Conqueror gave a large tract of land on the banks of the river Were, not far from Weres∣mouth; a reward for his own and his father's valour. That this Henry built Hylton castle in the year 1072, was one of the deputies that treated with the Conqueror concerning the four northern counties, and in the service of that prince, was at last slain in Normandy. That in the reign of Edward III. John Hylton, who sent four of his sons into the wars of France, under the command of the Black Prince, was first created baron of Hylton castle, for his gallant defence of it against the Scots incursions. That this peerage continued in the family for seven successions, till at last it was forfeited upon account of some un∣guarded words, whereof the then bishop of Durham gave the court information, which William the seventh and last baron of the family spoke against the queen, and her favourite De Le Pole. That upon the death of this William, which was thought to have been violent, the crown seizing upon the estate, gave it to the informing bishop, who held it for some time, to the utter exclusion of the right∣ful heir. That in process of time however, Lancelot, the grandson to the aforesaid William, was restored to his castle and part of his estate, no more of it indeed than what the bishop thought fit to allow him under this hard condition, that he and his heirs for ever should hold the moiety that was given them under certain rents and services to the Sec of Durham, and have the title of barons (but barons to the bishopric) annexed to their inheritance; and in that condi∣tion it has continued ever since. In the pedigree of the Hyltons there are seve∣ral names remarkable for their learning and piety, but almost innumerable those highly renowned for their martial deeds. War seems to have been the pleasure, genius, and recreation of the Hyltons, nor has any family been more lavish of their blood in defence of their country's cause. Since the time of the Conquest it is remarked of the Hyltons, that one was slain at Feversham in Kent, one in Normandy, one at Mentz in France, three in the holy wars under Richard I. one in the same under Edward I. three at the battle of Bourdeaux, under the Black Prince, one at Agincourt, two at Berwick upon Tweed against the Scots, two at the battle of St Albans, five at Market Bosworth, and four at Flodden Field.</Q></P>

The chancel was repaired and greatly altered by Mr Smith, who came to this rectory in 1704. The altar rails form a square, thereby admitting many communicants to the service: The inclosure is six paces in length, and three wide steps ascend to the rail; the whole is neatly wainscotted, and the east end ornamented with taber∣nacle work. The east window is under a pointed arch, and formed of five lights;
<PB N="513" REF="542"/>
there are four south windows, and one to the north, having two lights each, under pointed arches. From the steps, the chancel on each side is double stalled with oak, in the cathedral form, ornamented with a carved entablature in open work. The entrance from the nave is under a lofty pointed arch, rising from a cluster of small round pilasters; closed with stalls and a handsome wood screen, suitable to the rest of the chancel. The whole length of the chancel within the rails and with∣out is nineteen paces. The nave hath two regular ailes, formed by two rows of three round columns, about fourteen feet in height, uniform, with rolls for capitals, supporting circular arches; there are four upper windows on each side: The nave and ailes together are fifteen paces in width, and sixteen in length, regularly stalled with oak, and carved with fleur-de-lis. The pulpit is lofty, and well ornamented: Near it, in the end wall of the north aile, is a monument, having the effigy of a man in armour to the waist, with elevated hands, in high relief; belonging, as it is pre∣sumed, to one of the family of Middleton. The tower rises on short round pilasters, supporting pointed arches on the sides, and a lofty circular arch towards the nave. The west end of the nave is galleried. By the various modes of archi∣tecture which are seen in this edifice, it is evident, alterations have taken place at different periods, but that the old Saxon mode was the original one.</P>
<P>The rector of Weremouth for the time being is lord of the manor, and holds his courts, the customs and copyholds of which are of the same nature with the customs and copyholds of the bishop's manors. The history of this place is in∣volved in the confusion before noted relative to Monkweremouth, and we are not able to trace the antiquity with any degree of accuracy, either in relation to the foundation of the church or its endowment. Camden was overtaken in the error of William of Malmsbury <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lat. edition, p. 576. "In hoc S. Petri. Monasterio Beda, &amp;c. operam dedit, &amp;c."</NOTE>, and confounded Jarrow with Weremouth.

There was a carpenter, also a smith, who held lands for their work; the two places paid xx s. cornage, and provided two milch cows for the houshold. The lordship was then farmed out, with the increase of certain live stock appertaining thereto of cattle and sheep, which, with the mill, produced 20l. a year: The fisheries gave 6l. and the borough of Weremouth xx s. In bishop Hatfield's Survey we find an account taken of the products of this manor, in which more minute particulars are noted. Thomas Menvylle then held a place called Hynden, for plying of ships, under the rent of 2 s. and the parson of Weremouth held a pasture called the Hough: The bond∣men paid 19d. for scatpennys; for their privilege on Middlemoor and Littlemoor 10s. 10d. in the whole, and provided each two hens and ten eggs: For one milch cow they paid 6s. for cornage x s. woodlades 8 s. 8d. and for the common furnace 3s. 4d.

<P>Mr Frevile Lambton for twenty-five or thirty years last past hath been owner in his own right, of an ancient seat house situated in a street called Bishopwearmouth pans, at the west end of the town of Sunderland near the Sea, within the parish of Bishopwearmouth, and all that time was and is owner in his own right, of divers other houses and sundry parcels of land, situated in the parish of Bishopwearmouth.

<P>It hath been asserted by various writers, that Sunderland, either was so united with Weremouth, or so insignificant in Camden's time, as caused him not to mention it. Leland, in his Itinerary, takes no note of it. It is most probable the general name of Weremouth prevailed so much as occasioned Sunderland to escape the learned writers observation, especially as in the charter granted by bishop Pudsey, the borough had the name of Weremouth.</P>
<P>That charter is addressed, among other personages, as priors, archdeacons, &amp;c. to the bishop's barons, and grants, That the burgesses of Weremouth should enjoy the like liberties and free-customs, as the burgesses of Newcastle: That all pleas arising within the borough, except those of the crown, should be determined there. Dis∣putes between those plying with ships at that port, and merchants to whom the cargoes were sold, to be determined within the time of the third influx of the tide, that navigation might not be retarded: Merchandize brought by sea to be landed before sale, except salt and herrings. A year and a day's possession of lands, &amp;c. without claim, the claimant being within the realm, and not under age, a sufficient quietus. A burgess's son maintained by his father at bed and board, entitled to the like privileges as the father. A villain remaining and holding lands or tene∣ments

in the borough for a year and a day without interruption, to have the same franchise as a burgess. A burgess might sell his lands and go where he pleased, if no claim was subsisting against him. If a burgess was complained against, in a matter where battle ought to be waged, by a villain, he was to make defence by thirty-six men, unless the value in suit was one hundred pounds, or the crime im∣puted to him ought to be tried by battle. No burgess was compelled to fight against a villain unless he had forfeited his franchise. There was not to be within the borough <HI>blodwite, merchete, heriet,</HI> or <HI>blood drawing.</HI> The reve or head-borough was to look after forfeitures touching bread and beer. A burgess might bring in his corn from the country when he pleased, except at a time of prohibition or em∣bargo. Whatever a burgess bought he might sell without licence of the lord or consent of his heir. Every burgess had liberty to buy timber and sire wood equally with the burgesses of Durham. They should enjoy their common pasture as was originally granted to them, and which the bishop had caused to be perambulated. Customs of fish were reserved to the bishop, as Brus had from his people of Hart∣lepool.</P>
<P>The town of Sunderland stands on a point of land, having a steep descent to the river, which affords a convenient and safe haven for shipping. It was not anciently a port of note, yet not totally unfrequented; for in the preceding charter a provision is contained touching ships plying there: Yet we cannot form any great estimate of this port, when we observe in Hatfield's Survey, that John Hedworth had an ancient right of drawing a net in the very haven <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Sunderland.</HI></P>

The bishops of Durham successively ever since have frequently renewed these leases of the borough, ferryboat, passage, anchorage, beaconage, wharfage, plank∣age, meetage, and tolls of Sunderland port and market and fairs, and they are now in two leases, (A<SUP>o</SUP> 1729) to wit, the borough, with the courts, markets, fairs, tolls, anchorage, beaconage, &amp;c. to William Lambton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and the ferryboat passage, the metage, and tolls of herbs, fruit, and roots, to Walter Ettricke, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> for twenty-one years.—<HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 25.</P>
<P>The lease in 1661 to Walter Ettricke, was of all those his (the bishop's) ferryboats of Sunderland, in the county of Durham, and the passage over the water, port, or river of Sunderland, with free egress, regress, and landing over the said water, for all carriages and passengers over both sides of the said water; and also all tolls due and payable for all goods and commodities to be sold or vended in the said borough of Sunderland; and likewise the profits and duties upon salt, fruit, roots, victuals, and other merchandizes, sold by any man∣ner of metage imported to the port or haven of Sunderland, except the metage of salt, &amp;c. imported there for the bishop's use.

<P>1626, Richard Bartlet.—1628, Nich. Whitfield.—16 Nov. 1633, bishop Morton leased to Sir Wm Bellasses, knight, and others, in trust for the use of the city of Durham.—1638, Mich. Crake, a servant to the king, first by his majesty's patent, afterwards, in the vacancy of a lord high admiral, by lease, and after that by the earl of Northumberland, lord high admiral.—Bishop Morton always opposed him.—1642, Crake obtained an order of the commons of parliament, to prohibit the clearing of ships without his fees and warrant.—1643, the bishop's lessees obtained another order, revoking that to Crake, and quieting the lessees in the possession until it should be determined by law, which Crake did not prosecute at law, and so the lessees continued the possession till the lease expired during the commonwealth.—9 Nov. 1649, Col. Geo. Fenwick purchased of the usurper's trustees for sale of bishops lands, &amp;c. the reversion for 285l. 9s. 6d. and enjoyed it till the re∣storation, when bishop Cosin granted a new lease. Crake, then living, revived his claim, and the matter was referred by the duke of York, then lord high admiral, to Dr John Ecton, then judge of the admiralty of Eng∣land, who, 1st July, 1663, reported the bishop's claim and right to be good, and therein cited divers of the ancient charters and records before noted, to ground and warrant his report, which was allowed.—20 July, 1663, Crake being summoned and not shewing cause. Rot. A. Cosin, N<SUP>o</SUP> 17, 1661, bishop Cosin, by letters patent, made John Tempest, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> his vice admiral, quamdiu se bene gesseret.—Ibid. N<SUP>o</SUP> 18, by like patent he made Rich. Matthew, gent. judge of his court of admiralty.—N<SUP>o</SUP> 19, he also then made Walter Ettricke, gent. by patent, register of that court; afterwards William Blakiston, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> Charles Montague, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and William Lambton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> were successively vice admirals by patent from the bishop.—Sir Richard Lloyd, knt. and Henry Lambton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> were successively judges of the court of admiralty. The high court of admiralty hath frequently since the restoration, admitted of appeals from the bishop's court of admiralty at Sunderland. 16 Dec. 1662, bishop Cosin granted a new lease to Mr Robert Adamson of the borough and port of Sunder∣land, and of the anchorage, beaconage, wharfage, ballast shores, &amp;c. there, for 21 years: Rent 10l.—15 Oct. 1676, the lease was surrendered, and a new lease was granted by bishop Crewe to Edward Arden, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> Mr Geo. Forster, and the said Adamson, for twenty-one years at the like rent.—15 July, 1682, renewed by lord Crewe to Mr Geo. French.—Since renewed to William Richardson, William or Henry Lambton, <ABBR>esq.</ABBR>—<HI>Ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Rand's patent granted him the ancient see of 26s. 8d. yearly, with all other sees and duties to the office of water bailiff belonging, in as ample manner as any water bailiff in any port or river in the north parts of this realm law∣fully enjoyed: And thereby impowers him (inter alia) to collect, demand, and receive for the bishop's use, all such free customs or usages as to the said bishop in this port was due, and as in other ports for the like, and conveyance away of the ballast, and preservation of the said river was, ought, or might be due or appertain∣ing; and also to take to the bishop's use all rial fish, wrecks of the sea, customs, usages, and forfeitures what∣soever, which should thereafter happen to become due to the bishop within the said port or river or limits there∣of, upon any occasion or accident whatever; for which he was to render an account yearly to the bishop in his exchequer at Durham. Since Whitfield's time the office of water bailiff hath been held by leases granted by the bishops along with the borough of Sunderland. Mr French's lease specifies "All that his (the bishop's) borough and town of Sunderland, &amp;c. with all borough courts, perquisites of courts, and borough rents and other free rents duties, customs, and profits belonging to the said borough: And all that port and creek of Sunderland extending itself from the bar and low water mark of the sea unto the new bridge nigh Lumley park; together with the office of water bailiff of and within the said port, creek, and haven, and all anchorage and beaconage, plankage, wharfage, ballast shores, groundage, moorage, cranage, pickage, stallage, and poundage, with all privileges, liberties, conveniencies, and commodities incident thereto: And all and every the sum and sums of money, duties, benefits, and profits arising, or any ways growing due to the bishop or any of his successors, for or in respect of any ship, vessel, or boat coming into or going out of or anyways arriving, anchoring, mooring, loading or unloading at or in the port, creek, and haven of Sunderland afore∣said, or any part thereof, and the benefits, profits, commodities, advantages and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging, except for such ships as should arrive there for the bishop's own use." The lease hath been renewed to the present time.—Register 8, fo. 560—Reg. 9, fo. 106, 423—Reg. 10, fo. 219—Reg. 11, fo 129, 313—Reg. 12, fo. 276, 525—Reg. 13, fo. 287—Reg. 14, fo. 246—Reg. 15, fo. 476—Reg. 16, fo. 324.</P>

<P><PB N="521" REF="550"/>From all the records referred to it will appear, that it was not till after the sta∣tute of Henry VIII. by which the palatine jurisdiction was restrained and mutilated, Sunderland became a place of considerable note, and had its officers of distinction and police: Hartlepool, whilst the bishop of Durham had naval armaments, was the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the province, where the bishop had his officers, and received the fees, dues, and duties which in other ports were paid to the king.</P>
<P>Bishop Morton, desirous of encouraging the trade of Sunderland, in the year 1634, granted a charter of incorporation to the burgesses and inhabitants, by the title of mayor, twelve aldermen, and commonalty of the borough of Sunderland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Hunt. penes dec. &amp; cap. Dun.</NOTE>. The charter states, that Sunderland had beyond the memory of man been an an∣cient borough, known by the name of the new borough of Weremouth, contain∣ing in itself a certain part, where ships had plyed, bringing and carrying merchan∣dize, as well to and from foreign parts, as from other ports of this kingdom: The articles of exportation therein specified are sea coals, grind-stones, rub-stones, and whet-stones. It also states, that the trade was then greatly increased by the mul∣titude of ships resorting thither; and that the borough anciently enjoyed divers liberties and free customs, as well by prescription as by virtue of sundry charters from the bishops of Durham, confirmed to them by the crown; which from de∣fect in form proved insufficient for the support of the ancient liberties, privileges, and free customs of the borough, or to that effect. This charter granted the market and fairs, and appointed the mayor for the time being clerk of the market.</P>
<P><PB N="522" REF="551"/>For reasons not pointed out to us, this charter was suffered to expire; perhaps the miseries of those times, and the dreadful convulsions of the state, caused it to be neglected. But though the members of the incorporation did not long preserve their jurisdiction, the privileges granted to the inhabitants were assumed, and main∣tained in several suits at law, particularly touching the herbage of the town-moor, with the soil thereof: This common consists of about seventy or eighty acres only. In the case of Hicks versus Clerk, Lev. 2d part. p. 252, the custom is stated, that <Q>Sunderland is an ancient borough, consisting of twelve capital burgesses, called burgesses, and twelve inferior burgesses, called stallingers, and that each freeman occupying a house had commonage for two horses and four cows, and each stal∣linger for one cow; and that the widow of a freeman or stallinger, being an in∣habitant, had the like commonage after the husband's death.</Q> Upon error the judgment establishing this custom was affirmed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See a bill brought in the court of exchequer in the year 1729 or thereabouts, by Sir William Middleton and William Etterick of Barnes, against William Etterick of Silksworth, and some other people of Sunder∣land, and the depositions in the cause, especially the deposition of the defendant William Etterick; which will shew a right in the bishop of Durham to Sunderland town-moor, and that the freemen and stallingers are only entitled to the herbage.—<HI>Gyll's MSS.</HI></P>
<P>1776, June 17. In the court of exchequer, the long contested cause between Benjamin Hodgkin, plaintiff, and the corporation of freemen and stallingers, and other defendants, touching the right of the soil of the town-moor of Sunderland, was finally determined in favour of the corporation; and the plaintiff's bill, after a full hearing, was dismissed upon the merits, with costs.</P>

and vice-admiralty, to take especial cognizance thereof, and severely punish such as shall offend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The letters patent state, that <Q>Whereas we are informed by the humble petition of our well beloved sub∣jects the inhabitants of the borough and port of Sunderland near the Sea, upon the river of Weere, in the county palatine of Durham, that the harbour and river there being very commodiously situate for the ship∣ing of vast quantities of sea coles, plentifully gotten and wrought there for supply of all our subjects of our realm of England who can fetch the same, as also of foreign parts, is of late very much gorged, stopped up, and choaked, and by the many sholes, sand beds, and much breach and rubbish daily increasing in the same, is almost rendered innavigable, so as the said harbour and river, which in late years did receive and secure 400 sayle of shipps at one time, loaden with coals and other goods, cannot now receive any ship of considerable burthen without hazard; but the ship masters, merchants, and cole owners are constrained in part to load such ships exporting coles, and unload such ships importing other goods, at sea, near the mouth of the said harbour, to the prejudice of our revenue of the customs, and the great perill and danger of such ships and goods: And those ships which are of small draught of water and may go into the said harbour, do lye long there for their loadings, by reason of the said shoals and sand beds in the said river obstructing the bringing down of coles and other goods for their loadings, and being so loaden do wait long for spring tydes and winds to carry them to sea, which much enhanceth the price of coles in many parts of our realme, and is of hindrance to the maritime commerce: And that it would be very expe∣dient and necessary, and also greatly advantagious and beneficial, not onely to us, our heirs and successors in the advancement of our revenue of the customs, and to our merchants and seafaring men, in the en∣couragement of trade and increase of shipping and navigation, but in the setting up of a convenient fishing trade there, if the harbour and river belonging to the port of Sunderland aforesaid were cleansed,</Q> &amp;c.</P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The regal jurisdiction of the bishop of Durham being in many instances removed by the statute of Henry VIII. the conservatorship of the river Were and port of Sunderland was vested in the powers of the crown, and the necessary revival of that authority became daily obvious; so that an act of parliament was applied for and obtained in the 3d year of k. George I. for the preservation and improvement of the river Were and port and haven of Sunderland, and commissioners were ap∣pointed for twenty-one years <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>There is a power to charge any sum not exceeding 3 d. a chaldron on the coal owner, and 1 d. on the fitters.—In the act of 1726 there is power to borrow money on the credit of those duties.—By an act passed in the 32d of George II. the duties were continued for a further term of 21 years, and were afterwards made perpetual.—By an act 1st queen Anne, a farthing a chaldron was granted on all coals shipped at Sunderland, in support of the piers of Whitby, and by several subsequent laws, that impost was continued, and an addi∣tional farthing granted to continue to June 1, 1781.—V. coal owners case, 1766, on petition to parliament.</P></NOTE>. In the thirteenth year of the same reign another act was obtained, entituled, <Q>An act for the more effectual preservation and im∣provement of the river Were and port and haven of Sunderland,</Q> &amp;c. by which additional powers were granted to the commissioners. In the twentieth year of George II. another act was obtained and commissioners appointed, who were im∣powered to survey the river so far as to a place called New bridge, (being Chester new bridge) to which place they might make it navigable; and also the port, haven, and harbour of Sunderland, as the same extends from the promontory or point called Souter Point, about two miles from Sunderland bar towards the north-east, and so into the sea to five fathom at low water, and from thence in a sup∣posed direct line, till it fall opposite to that land called Ryhope Dean, about two miles towards the south. By subsequent laws the powers of the commissioners have been continued.</P>
<P>In 1719, Sunderland being increased so greatly in population, that it was im∣possible for the inhabitants to be received to the offices of the church at Were∣mouth, an act of parliament was obtained for making the town and township of
<PB N="524" REF="553"/>
Sunderland a distinct parish from the parish of Bishopweremouth; in the pre∣amble of which it is stated, that Sunderland contained six thousand souls and upwards, and that a beautiful church had been erected, with a vestry-room, and a dwelling-house for a minister or rector to live in, upon a parcel of ground, part of one of the common fields of Sunderland, and within the manor and borough of Sunderland, called the Intack, and had inclosed or doled out a parcel of ground adjoining thereto for a cemetery or church-yard. By this act Sunderland was made a rectory, the patronage of which should for ever appertain to the bishop of Durham. A vestry or association of inhabitants was instituted by this act, consist∣ing of twenty-four persons having freehold estates of the yearly value of 10l. to be chosen by the parishioners, and to continue in office three years, and so a succession to be chosen every three years, in which vestry-men was vested a power to make ordinances and by-laws, for the regulation of the new parish, to be ratified by two justices, to appoint a scavenger, and to assess on estates, real and personal, and stock in trade, a sufficient sum for the purposes therein mentioned, and particularly for paying to the rector a yearly stipend of eighty pounds, and to the clerk ten pounds, and a competent sum to the scavenger, to be levied by warrant from two or more justices of the peace. The rectory to be discharged of first-fruits, tenths, procurations, and synodals; but the tithes of fish, and of corn and hay growing within the parish, were reserved for the rectory of Bishopweremouth, the new rectory taking only Easter reckonings, surplice fees, and other small dues.</P>
<P>The trade of Sunderland is very considerable: In the Description of England and Wales, page 265<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Also England Displayed, published by Russell and Owen, 1769.</NOTE>, it is thus spoken of, <Q>It is a well-built populous sea port town, having a fine church, which the late rector, Mr Newcomb, spent the greatest part of his income in beautifying and adorning. He began by building a dome adjoining to the east end, into which he removed the altar, placing it under a canopy of inlaid work, supported in front by two fluted columns of the Corinthian order; but this gentleman died before he had finished his intended improvements. From the coal trade the inhabitants derive great wealth: The coal is so remarkable for burning slow, that it is said to make three fires. The port was formerly so shallow, that ships were obliged to take in their lading in the open road, which was sometimes attended with very great danger to the keelmen, who bring the coals down to the ships; on this account the vessels which loaded here, were usually smaller than in the neighbouring ports; but as they ride in the open sea, they no sooner get in their lading than they are ready to sail, which is a considerable advantage, as they have been known to steer from thence, to deliver their coals at London, to beat up against the wind in their return, and to get back before the ships at Shields, which were loaden before them, had been able to get over the bar: But this inconvenience has been in a great measure removed. The town is much improved and increased within these fifty years. The principal street is of great length, and of consider∣able breadth, parallel to which runs another, but narrower, besides a great number of others. The town, with the adjacent hamlets of Bishopweremouth,
<PB N="525" REF="554"/>
Bishopweremouth salt-pans, Monkweremouth, and the north shore side, contain about twenty thousand inhabitants. Those who are delighted with sea prospects may here see twenty or thirty sail of ships coming in with a flowing tide, from the coasting and foreign parts, fifteen or twenty going out on their respective voyages, and thirty or forty sail at anchor in the road, taking in their cargoes. Here is a very fine pier, which affords a pleasant walk, as well as shelter for the ships, and is said to have cost about 19,000l. They have also deepened the south channel, by taking up part of the rock. So great is the trade of Sunder∣land, that in 1752, there belonged to this port alone about one hundred and ninety ships, which are chiefly loaden with coals, the staple commodity of the place, and the produce of the adjacent country, whence many people are em∣ployed, and great sums brought in. In the summer season there are about ten thousand tons of lime and lime-stone, carried from this river, in small sloops of about twenty or thirty tons. It is said that there were loaded at this port, in 1748, 2497 sail of ships: And in the year 1752, besides the small sloops already mentioned, <TABLE>

</TABLE> This account is exactly transcribed from the custom-house books of that year, and many of these ships were from one hundred to five hundred tons burthen. The amount of the duties of goods exported and imported from and to foreign parts com. ann. is about 10,000l. And as it is computed that about 260,000 Winchester chaldrons of coals are carried coastwise, whereon there is a duty of five shillings a chaldron on delivery, amounting to 65,000l. the whole revenue arising to the crown from the imports, exports, and produce of Sunderland, may be reckoned about 75,003l. per annum, so that possibly, with respect to the duty arising from it, it may be the sixth, or at least the seventh port in the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>In addition to the preceding account, it is to be observed, that the chief or high street of Sunderland is nearly a mile in length, the houses well built with brick; the low street which runs parallel thereto, and adjoins upon the quay, is narrow and extremely populous: There are some new streets which run from the upper side of the high street, containing several elegant buildings. In regard to the po∣pulation, in the year 1681, there were 83 burials in Bishopweremouth, which being multiplied by 30, (the average number which hath been found on general calculations of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ths in this county) would make the number of souls in Were∣mouth and Sunderland 2490. The number of burials in Weremouth in the year 2781 was 153, and in Sunderland 382, which on the like calculation, will give
<PB N="526" REF="555"/>
16,050, to which if we add 4890 for Monkweremouth, the whole number of souls will be 20,940. By the above account it appears the increase in population in one century was not less than 18,450 souls. The pier which was erected at the mouth of the river, in the coal owners case in 1766, before referred to, on the 21st of December, 1765, had cost 50,000l. and would then require 30,000l. more to perfect it. There are 350 vessels and upwards belonging to this port; and from the 5th of July to the 10th of August, 1776, inclusive, there were cleared at the custom-house 980 sail of ships coal-loaden, and above 100 vessels with lime: 5700 vessels cleared here in one year; and this navigation was performed by 1100 dif∣ferent vessels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Robert Walker's minutes.—Williamson comptroller's clerk and deputy cust.</NOTE>. There is a sail-cloth manufactory carried on at Bishopweremouth, and in Sunderland three great roperies, various anchor-smiths forges, and six building yards, constantly employed.

No burials are permitted within the church. Above the vestry is a small parochial library. Besides this church an elegant chapel was erected by subscription in the year 1769, dedicated to St John: The minister's stipend, with the clerk's fee, and other inferior officers, are paid by the annual rents of the pews, which are farmed out: It has a good organ. Much attention was paid to this laudable institution by John Thornhill, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who has the right of presentation for twenty-one years from the time of consecration.

<P>Authors have made various conjectures touching the derivation of the name of Sunderland, some insisting it is the ancient Saxon <HI>Sonderland,</HI> signifying a particu∣lar precinct, with privileges of its own; others, that the name is expressive of a peninsula, severed and separated from the main land; and this latter appears the most probable, for we see by the ancient records, that in bishop Hatfield's time Hynden was a place held by Thomas Menvyll for the plying of ships <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Vide exemplum An. 19 Ed. 3. 1346.

<P><Q>This town has been honoured by our kings in giving title of earl to several noble families, viz. Emanuel lord Scroope of Bolton, who having been first made president of the king's council in the north by king James I. the 6th of February, 1618, was by his son Charles I. created earl of Sunderland, the 19th of June, 1628: But dying without lawful issue, the same king created Henry lord Spencer of Wormleighton (in respect to his approved loyalty and adherence to him in the civil wars then on foot) earl of Sunderland, but he enjoyed his honour a small time, being slain the same year at the battle of Newbury, leaving a son Robert earl of Sunderland, who died in 1702, and was succeeded by Charles earl of Sunderland.</Q></P>

<BIBL><HI>Hatfield's Survey</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Elfer de Birden then held two oxgangs of land, paying eight shillings rent, and serving on the bishop's embassies: Anfridus had the same service. The two vills paid thirty-two shillings cornage, and provided two milch cows. The lordship and demesne were then in farm, with a stock of three hundred sheep, under the rent of twenty-eight celders
<PB N="530" REF="559"/>
or chaldrons of bread corn, the like quantity of oats, and fourteen of barley, toge∣gether with six marks in money, for the increase of the flock. Little Birden was then held by John de Houghton, under x s. rent, and the service of carrying the bishop's wine with four oxen, and attending the forest chace with two greyhounds. By bishop Hatfield's Survey we see that Will. de Hoton held lands at Ryhope by foreign service. The bond tenants paid each six bushels of oats, called the scot∣oats, or allotted oats, and in the lieu of work 12 s. and for mill farm and toll or mulcture 13s. 7d. and for the aid or exchequer money, or as it is called scat-pennys

John Diconson held twelve acres of land called Smythsland, and Ra. Cuke the Punderland, rendering besides 4s. 6d. rent, four score hens, and six hundred eggs. The cottagers, besides other services, paid 12d. for work called hornyeld<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The hornyeld was a payment made in forests, for horned cattle depasturing. But the bishop having no forest there, we think the word is wrong transcribed, and should be hinegeld, which was a mulct paid as a <HI>quatantia</HI> for transgressions; and hinefare in the old books was a fine to the king, <HI>si quis occidit hominem regis;</HI> a mulct not unnecessary on such stormy coasts.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>SEAHAM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The next adjoining parish towards the south is SEAHAM, situated upon the sea shore. The village is small, having one chief mansion, the summer seat of the family of Milbanke of Halnaby. This is one of the places said to be restored to the church of St Cuthbert by Athelstan, but by what means afterwards aliened, is not known, as it is a freehold manor. The first family we find settled at Sea∣ham was that of Hadham, Sir Nich. de Hadham, knight, being possessed of this manor in 1260 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Rot. Bury, sch. xx.

We were told that in repair∣ing the chancel, a fire grate and tongs of iron were discovered below the founda∣tions; and that the walls are constructed of stone and mud, without lime. The nave and chancel are of an equal width, there being no ailes; the chancel is nine

paces in length, and the nave sixteen, and five paces in width. There are three windows to the south and two to the north in the nave, and the like number north and south in the choir, with two small windows to the east. The tower is narrow. In the church yard is a stone coffin, with a cover, lately dug up; the cover ridged on the top, as if designed to shut off any water that might come to it; on one side of the cover is an inscription with some Saxon characters, <HI>"Hic jacet Richardus vic. de Sehaiam."</HI> In the list of incumbents we find two Richards in antiquity, Richard de Overton in 1293, and Richard de Ledyerde in 1451. The probability that this coffin contained the remains of Overton, rests on the circumstances of the Saxon character and stone coffins being disused in so late an aera as the fifteenth century; it was a degree of elegance used in an∣cient interments to have such coffins. The body was then wound in fine linens. attired in the most honourable vestments, and laid in spices; things not suited to mean personages. Richard de Overton was of such consequence, that in the twenty-second of Edward I. he had the king's letters of protection <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Prynn, p. 596.</NOTE>.</P>

Boldon Book there were thirteen cottagers in Houghton, each of whom held twelve acres of land, and wrought for the lord two days in each week throughout the year, and four days at harvest with all their family, except the housewife, and paid one hen and five eggs: There were also three half-cottagers, who held six acres each, and wrought two days in each week from Pentecost to Martinmas. Henry <HI>praepositus,</HI> the reeve or headborough, held two oxgangs of land, consisting of twenty-four acres each, for his service. The smith had twelve acres, the car∣penter a toft and four acres, the pinder had twenty acres and a thrave of corn from each carucate of land in Houghton, Wardon, and Morton, and rendered sixty hens and three hundred eggs. Newbottle and Biddick mills, with a moiety of Rainton mill, produced fifteen marcs. The demesne with the stock of sheep and pasture, were in the lord's hands. By Hatfield's Survey it appears that Will. Milby held the malting or brewery of Houghton, under the yearly rent of 10s. and that one Elwick had the common bakehouse at 2s. rent; that there was only one free tenant in Houghton, Isabell the wife of Rob. de Wessynton, who held lands of 13s. 4d. <HI>fee-farm,</HI> theretofore the estate of John de Cornhill; but we are not able to trace down the possession by the inquisitions <HI>post mortem,</HI> under the succeeding prelates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Indictm.—W.

The chapel was built by Mr Daven∣port, and stalled and wainscotted with Irish oak at the same time that he erected the present mansion-house. The tower was erected by John Kelyng, clerk, about the year 1483. He being rector, began to inclose, fortify, and embattle a house above the lower porch within his rectory, with a wall of lime and stone, and to make a fortress of it without licence: Bishop Dudley pardoned the offence, and in consideration of a fine paid, granted him licence to embattle the house, and make it a fortress for himself and successors for ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Rot.

About eighty years after Kelyng's time, Bernard Gilpin expended upon the rectory and out-buildings near three hundred pounds, as he informs us in his will; but the greatest improvements were made by Mr George Davenport, who continued rector from 1664 to 1677; he rebuilt the mansion-house and chapel at his own expence, as well as the garden walls, and repaired the offices.</P>
<P>The church stands on a rising ground †, in the center of a square area, formed by the buildings of the lower part of the town: It is in the form of a cross, with the tower in the center. The chancel is in length fourteen paces to the steps which ascend to the communion table, and within the rail four paces; the width six paces. It was some years ago wainscotted, and stalled on each side, probably by Mr Davenport; for on the north side is a shield bearing the arms of bishop <FIGURE>

being much decayed, was removed by the present rector, and the chancel is now fitted up with plaister in an elegant stile. The stalls too, being much decay∣ed, have been repaired. The east window, consisting of five lights, is under a pointed arch. There are beside five other windows in the chancel, one of four lights under a flat arch, three under pointed arches, divided by a small pilaster, and an adjoining one under a flat arch. The tower stands on four columns, giving an interior square of six paces, opening on every side to form the cross, and lead to the four limbs of the building. The nave is twenty-four paces in length from the pillars of the square, and has regular ailes formed by rows of three uniform clustered columns supporting pointed arches, which at the western extremity spring from pilasters of similar form with the pillars; the whole having great symmetry, and being of beautiful architecture. The width of the nave, with its ailes, is twelve paces. The side lights are regular, four on each side, and modern. The west window consists of five lights under a pointed arch. The reading desk is placed against the north west corner pillar, and the pulpit opposite to it. There is at present in agitation a plan for rebuilding the stalls and seating the church, many of which are now ruinous and much decayed; for removing the old organ, and introducing a new one in a gallery to be erected against the north wall of the church. The organ is placed in the south limb of the cross. The windows at the extremities of the cross are under pointed arches: One limb of this cross, but whether the north or south we cannot ascertain, is called Trinity porch. The nave is ceiled and stuccoed, and very clean.</P>
<P>There were two guilds instituted in this church, one dedicated to the Holy Trinity, the other to the blessed Virgin. In the records we find <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cop. Book, E. p. 394.</NOTE> that Rob. Hudeson of Morton, with Rob. Smyth of Hoghton, and John Peerson, were fined on the 14th of November, in the twelfth year of bishop Laurence, 1468, for attempting to found a fraternity at Houghton, without the bishop's licence, contrary to the act of Mortmain: But the same bishop, in the nineteenth year of his pontificate, granted licence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rot.

<P>There was also a chantry in this church dedicated to St Margaret and St Katha∣rine: Yearly value 3l. 15s.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Henry Nollop, the last incumbent of St Mary's chantry, had a pension of 3l. p' annum, which he lived to receive in the year 1553.</P>

<PB N="543" REF="574"/></P>
<P><PB N="544" REF="575"/>The reader perhaps expects some short anecdotes in this place, of that excellent man Bernard Gilpin; we have selected several particulars given by William Gilpin, A. M. of Queen's College, Oxford, and others his biographers.</P>
<P>Bernard Gilpin, descended from a good family in Westmoreland, was born at Kentmire in that county, in the year 1517<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His father's elder brother was slain in the battle of Bosworth field, being heir in the fifth descent to Richard Gilpin, who in the reign of king John was enfeoffed in the lordship of Kentmire-hall, by the baron of Kendal, for his singular services.</NOTE>. From his earliest youth he was inclined to a contemplative life; was thoughtful, reserved, and serious. His first years were spent at a public grammar school, from whence, at the age of sixteen, he was re∣moved to Oxford, and entered upon the foundation at Queen's College. He ap∣plied himself closely to his studies, and made a considerable proficiency in the
<PB N="545" REF="576"/>
learning of the times. Having determined to study divinity, that he might read the scriptures, he set out with great industry to gain a thorough knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew languages, in which he was much assisted by Mr Neal, a fellow of New College, and afterwards professor of Hebrew in Oxford.</P>
<P>At the usual term he took the degree of master of arts, and about the same time was elected fellow of his college: But shortly after, on account of his learn∣ing, was made choice of among those who were appointed to supply the col∣lege newly founded by Cardinal Wolsey, and to which he was accordingly re∣moved.</P>
<P>As Mr Gilpin was bred in the Roman Catholic religion, he continued a consi∣derable time steady to that church, and in defence thereof held a disputation against Hooper, afterwards bishop of Worcester, in the reign of Henry VIII. But when Edward VI. mounted the throne, Peter Martyr went to Oxford, and there read divinity lectures in a strain to which the university had been little accustomed. Mr Gilpin's credit in the university was become considerable, the Popish party were therefore very solicitous to engage him to side publicly with them; and when they made the most pressing applications to him for that purpose, they found his zeal much cooler than their own. He was not indeed satisfied with the Reformers, having had few opportunities of making himself acquainted with their arguments: But on the other hand he never was bigoted in his religion. While his mind was in so unsettled a condition, he thought himself but ill qualified to espouse either side publicly. Such importunity was however used with him, that at length he yielded, and appeared next day against Peter Martyr.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin entered into the controversy against his inclination: He resolved to lay aside, as much as possible, the temper of a caviller, and to place truth before him as the sole object of his pursuit, from which he was determined not to be drawn aside either by prejudice or novelty. The disputation was therefore soon over; for Mr Gilpin had nothing of that pride of heart which leads men to de∣fend suspected opinions, but gave up his cause with that grace which always at∣tends sincerity. He owned publicly that he could not maintain it, and determined to enter into no more controversies till he gained full information of the subject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Peter Martyr took notice of this difference of behaviour, and frequently said, that he was not much troubled either for Weston, Morgan, or the rest, (Gilpin's fellow disputants) <Q>but as for that Gilpin, (said he) I am very much moved concerning him; for he doeth and speaketh all things with an upright heart. The rest seem to me to be men who are carried away as it were with every blast of ambition and covetousness. But Gilpin, resting firmly upon gravity and manners, and the testimony of a most laudable life, seemeth to honour with his own goodness the cause which he undertaketh.</Q> Martyr would likewise tell his friends, that it was the subject of his daily prayers, that God would be pleased to touch the heart of this pious priest with the knowledge of true religion.</P></NOTE>. He communicated some of his doubts to bishop Tunstall, who was his mother's uncle, and had always expressed great regard for him, and also conferred with Dr Redman <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr J. Redman, or Redmayne, was nearly related to bishop Tunstall, and eminently distinguished for his learning, the interests of which he greatly promoted at Cambridg by his influence and example. Mr Ascham, in his Schoolmaster, says, <Q>At Cambridge, in St John's college, in my time I do know, that not so much the good statutes, as two gentlemen of worthy memory, Sir John Cheke and Dr Redman, by their own example of excellency in learning, of godliness in living, of diligence in studying, of councel in exhorting, by good order in all things, did breed up so many learned men in that one college of St John's at one time, as I believe the whole university of Louvain in many years was never able to afford.</Q></P></NOTE>, of whose virtue and learning he had formed an high opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="546" REF="577"/>As an academic life afforded the most leisure for study, so Mr Gilpin was most inclined thereto: He had too just a sense of the duty of a clergyman to be unac∣quainted with the qualifications requisite for its discharge, and too mean an opi∣nion of himself to think he was yet master of them: He judged more learning was necessary in that controversial age, than he had yet acquired; and his chief argument with his friends, who were continually soliciting him to leave the uni∣versity, was, that he was not yet sufficiently instructed in religion himself, to be a teacher of it to others. These thoughts continued him at Oxford till the thirty-fifth year of his age; but about that time the vicarage of Norton, in the diocese of Durham, falling vacant, his friends prevailed upon him to accept it, though not without much difficulty. Accordingly a presentation passed in November, 1552. But before he took possession of his benefice, he was appointed to preach before king Edward VI. who then resided at Greenwich; Sir William Cecil having ob∣tained for him a general licence for preaching.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin having staid some time in London, repaired to his parish, and imme∣diately entered upon the duties of his function. He failed not as occasions of∣fered, to use the king's licence in other parts of the country; but his own parish he considered as the place where his chief care was due. Here he made it his principal endeavour to inculcate moral virtue, and to dissuade from those vices which he observed most prevalent. He seldom handled controverted points, being afraid, lest endeavouring to instruct, he might mislead. At length he thought he had engaged too soon in his office, and that he could not properly discharge the duties of it; his mind was not satisfied, whilst he merely gave his hearers moral in∣structions, overspread as the country was with disputed articles of faith, and he conceived he acted improperly in pretending to be a teacher of religion, if he was unable to oppose the prevalent errors. These thoughts made every day a greater impression upon him, and at length growing quite unhappy, he wrote an account of his situation of mind to bishop Tunstall, who was then in the Tower. The prelate thereupon advised Mr Gilpin to provide a trusty curate for his parish, and to spend a year or two in Germany, France, and Holland, by which means he might have an opportunity of conversing with some of the most eminent pro∣fessors, both Protestants and Papists. This advice gave Gilpin much satisfaction; for a conference with some of the learned men abroad was what he had long earnestly desired. His principal objection to the scheme was, that it would prove too expensive: But as to that, Tunstall wrote to him, that his living would do something towards his maintenance, and he would supply deficiences. This, how∣ever, did not remove the difficulty; Mr Gilpin's notions of clerical duty were so strict, that he thought no excuse could justify non-residence for so considerable a time as he intended to be abroad. He could not, therefore, think of supporting himself with any part of the income of his living. He was determined to go abroad, and resolved, if he staid the shorter time, to rely only upon his own frugal
<PB N="547" REF="578"/>
management of the little money he had, and to leave the rest to the bishop's generosity. Accordingly he resigned his living in favour of a worthy man, with whose abilities and character he was well acquainted, and then set out for London, to receive his last orders from the bishop, and to embark. The account of his re∣signation got to town before him, and gave Tunstall, who was anxious for his kinsman's thriving in the world, great concern. "Here are your friends," said he, <Q>endeavouring to provide for you, and you are taking every method to frustrate their wishes: But be warned; by these courses you will presently bring yourself to a morsel of bread.</Q> Mr Gilpin begged the bishop would attribute what he had done to a scrupulous conscience, which would not permit him to act otherwise.</P>
<P>Before he took leave of the bishop, the latter put into Mr Gilpin's hands a treatise he had written upon the Eucharist, desiring he would cause it to be printed under his inspection at Paris. Soon after which he embarked for Holland, and upon his landing, went immediately to Mechlin, to visit his brother George, who was at that time pursuing his studies there. But after a few weeks he went to Louvain, where he resolved to settle for some time. He made frequent excursions to Antwerp, Ghent, Brussels, and other places in the Low Countries; where he spent some weeks with men of reputation, who held both sides of the controversial tenets; but he made Louvain his chief place of residence, for which city he al∣ways expressed a more than common affection. Louvain was then one of the most distinguished places for students in divinity; some eminent divines on both sides of the question resided there, and the most important topics of religion were discussed with great freedom.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin's first business there was to get himself introduced to those of emi∣nence for learning; to whom his own address and attainments were no mean re∣commendations. He was present at all public readings and disputations; commit∣ted every thing material to writing; re-examined all his opinions; proposed his doubts in private to his friends; and in every respect made the best use of his time.</P>
<P>Whilst he was thus prosecuting his studies, he and the Protestants in those parts were alarmed with the melancholy news of the death of king Edward, the un∣successful attempt in favour of lady Jane, and the accession of queen Mary: But it came attended with one agreeable circumstance; an account of bishop Tunstall's release from the Tower, and re-establishment in his bishopric. Soon afterwards Mr Gilpin received a letter from his brother George, intreating him to come to Mechlin, to confer on an affair of importance. On his arrival he found his bro∣ther had received a letter from the bishop, informing him, that he had found a benefice of considerable value vacant in his diocese, which he wished he could per∣suade his brother Bernard to accept, imagining he might by this time have got over his former scruples: And accordingly George used his utmost endeavours for this purpose, but without effect; Bernard continuing inflexible in his resolution, not to accept of any benefice without discharging the duties of it. He therefore returned to Louvain; but, however, thought it incumbent on him to give the bishop his reasons for not accepting his kind offer. The bishop was not offended
<PB N="548" REF="579"/>
at this letter; for the unaffected piety of it disarmed all resentment, and led him rather to admire a behaviour, in which the motives of conscience shewed them∣selves so superior to those of interest.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin continued some time longer at Louvain, daily improving in religious knowledge. But while he staid in the Low Countries, he was greatly affected with the melancholy sight of crouds of his dejected countrymen arriving daily in those parts, to avoid the bloody persecution then carrying on in England. It gave him, however, some pleasure to find, though he was unable personally to assist them, yet his acquaintance in the country furnished him with the means of being useful to many of them by his recommendations.</P>
<P>When he had been about two years in Flanders he left Louvain, and went to Paris, where his first care was printing the bishop's book, which he performed en∣tirely to his satisfaction. During his stay at Paris he lodged with Vascosan, an eminent printer, to whom he had been recommended by his friends in the Nether∣lands. This learned man shewed him great regard, did him many friendly offices, and introduced him to the most considerable persons in the city.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin having spent three years abroad, returned into England in 1556, whilst the persecution was still carrying on against the Protestants. Bishop Tun∣stall received his kinsman with great kindness, and soon after his arrival gave him the archdeaconry of Durham, to which the rectory of Easington was annexed. He immediately repaired to his parish, where he preached with great boldness against the vices, errors, and corruptions of the times; and by virtue of his office of archdeacon, he also took great pains to reform the manners of the clergy. His free reproofs soon roused the ecclesiastics of those parts against him, and put them upon every method in their power to remove so inconvenient an enquirer. The popular clamour amongst them was, that Gilpin was an enemy to the church, a scandalizer of the clergy, and a preacher of false doctrines; and that religion must suffer from the heresies he was daily uttering, if he was suffered any longer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Some found great fault, for that I preached repentance and salvation by Christ; and did not make whole sermons, as they did, about transubstantiation, purgatory, holy water, images, prayers to saints, and such like.</Q></P>

</FIGURE></P></NOTE>. In short, a charge of heresy, consisting of thirteen articles, was drawn up against him, and he was accused in form before the bishop of Durham. But Tunstall, who was much practised in the world, easily found a method of dismissing the cause in such a manner as to protect his nephew, without endangering himself. The malice of his enemies could not rest, and they created him so much trouble, that not being able to undergo the fatigue of duty, he begged leave of the bishop to resign either the archdeaconry or his parish, which his lordship thought fit: To which the bishop answered, that the income of the former was not a support without the latter, and that he could not consent to their being separated. Upon this Mr Gilpin re∣signed both of them; but the bishop soon after presented him with the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring.</P>
<P>This extensive rectory, containing no less than fourteen villages, had been as much neglected in that dark age, as the cures in the north then generally were.
<PB N="549" REF="580"/>
All ancient customs and ceremonies were carried higher than in most other places, and were considered as the essentials of religion. And it is said, through the de∣signed neglect of bishops and justices of the peace, king Edward's proclamations for a change of worship had not even been heard of in this part of the king∣dom, at the time of that prince's death.</P>
<P>Such was the condition of the parish of Houghton when it was committed to the care of Mr Gilpin; described by his biographers and other writers, to be then a waste so miserably uncultivated, that the greatest industry seemed necessary to bring it into any kind of order; and the greatest resolution was requisite in the at∣tempt. But when the good of mankind was concerned, this true christian mini∣ster had resolution to attempt whatever industry could accomplish. He was grieved to see ignorance and vice prevail: But he did not despair. The people crouded about him, and heard him with great attention, perceiving him to be a teacher of a very different kind from those to whom they had been accustomed.</P>
<P>When Mr Gilpin took possession of Houghton, he found the parsonage-house gone so to decay, that he could not reside in it; part of it was sitted up as soon as possible for his reception, but he continued improving and enlarging it till it be∣came suitable to his hospitable temper, a proper habitation for a man who never intended to keep what he had, to himself. Soon after his acceptance of the rectory
<PB N="550" REF="581"/>
of Houghton, Tunstall urged him to accept of a stall then vacant in the cathedral church of Durham, telling him, that there lay not the same objection to this as to the archdeaconry, it being quite a sinecure, and therefore he would have no rea∣sonable pretence for refusing it. But Mr Gilpin, unwilling to accept it, told the bishop, that by his bounty he had already more wealth, than, he was afraid, he should give a good account of. He begged, therefore, he might not have an ad∣ditional charge, but that his lordship would rather bestow this preferment on one by whom it was more wanted.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin now lived in a retired manner, and gave no immediate offence to the clergy; the experience he had of their temper made him more reserved. Indeed he used more caution than he could afterwards approve; for in his future life he would often tax his behaviour at this time with weakness and cowardice. But all his caution was ineffectual; for he was soon formally accused before the bishop of Durham, who again found means to protect him. The malice of his enemies suc∣ceeded in part; for Tunstall's favour from this time visibly declined, and he struck him out of his will, of which he had before made him the executor. This loss gave Mr Gilpin little concern: He was sorry, indeed, to see the bishop disgusted; he acknowledged his great obligations to him; and would have given up any thing to have him satisfied, except his conscience. But good conscience, he was assured, was his best friend; and he was resolved not to part with it for any mortal friend upon earth.</P>
<P>His enemies, in the mean time, were not thus silenced. Enraged at this second defeat, they caused thirty-two articles to be drawn up against him in the strongest manner, and laid before Bonner bishop of London. Here they went the right way to work: Bonner was a man suited to their purpose; and accordingly gave im∣mediate orders for his apprehension. Mr Gilpin being no stranger to the burn∣ing zeal of the bishop of London, had no sooner notice of the persecution, than he prepared for martyrdom: He caused a long garment to be provided, that he might go in the more decent manner to the stake, and set out for London. In his way thither he broke his leg, which put a stop for some time to his journey. The per∣sons in whose custody he was, it is said, took occasion from thence maliciously to retort upon him an observation that he would frequently make, <Q>that nothing happens unto us but what is intended for our good,</Q> asking him, whether he thought his broken leg was so intended? He answered meekly, he made no ques∣tion but it was: And indeed so it proved in the strictest sense; for before he was able to travel, queen Mary died, and he was set at liberty. Whether all the parti∣culars of this story are true or not, thus much however is certain, that the account of the queen's death met him upon the road, and put a stop to any further prose∣cution.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin being thus providentially rescued from his enemies, returned to Houghton, through crowds of people, expressing the utmost joy, and blessing God for his deliverance. The following year he lost his friend and relation bishop Tunstall; but he soon experienced, that worth like his would naturally procure friends. When the popish bishops were deprived, the earl of Bedford recommend∣ed
<PB N="551" REF="582"/>
him to queen Elizabeth for the bishopric of Carlisle, and took care that a congé d'elire should be sent down to the dean and chapter for that purpose: But Mr Gil∣pin declined this promotion; and when much pressed to assign his reasons for re∣fusing it, he said, that if any other bishopric but Carlisle had been offered to him, he possibly might have accepted it: <Q>But in that diocese (said he) I have so many friends and acquaintance, of whom I have not the best opinion, that I must either connive at many irregularities, or draw upon myself so much hatred, that I should be less able to do good there than any one else.</Q> Mr Gilpin persist∣ing in his refusal, the bishopric was at length given to Dr Best. The year after he had an offer made him of the provostship of Queen's College in Oxford; which he likewise declined.</P>
<P>In the mean time Gilpin continued to reside at Houghton, discharging the duties of his function in the most exemplary manner. When he first took upon himself the care of a parish, he laid it down as a maxim, to do all the good in his power there; and accordingly his whole conduct was only one streight line drawn to this point. He set out with making it his endeavour to gain the affections of his par∣ishioners. Many of his papers shew how material a point he considered this. To succeed in it, however, he used no servile compliances: He studied that his means should be good as well as his end. His behaviour was free without levity, obliging without meanness, and insinuating without art. He condescended to the weak, bore with the passionate, and complied with the scrupulous; and in a truly apostolic manner, "became all things to all men." By these means he gained upon his neighbours, and convinced them how heartily he was their friend.</P>
<P>To his humanity and courtesy he added an unwearied application to the in∣struction of those under his care. He was not satisfied with the advice he gave in public, but used to teach in private; and brought his parishioners to come to him with their doubts and difficulties. He had a most engaging manner towards those whom he thought well-disposed: Nay, his very reproof was so conducted, that it seldom gave offence; the becoming gentleness with which it was urged, made it always appear the effect of friendship. Thus, with unceasing assiduity, did he employ himself in admonishing the vicious, and encouraging the well-disposed, by which means, in a few years, he made a greater change in his neighbourhood than could well have been imagined. A remarkable instance what reformation a single man may effect, when he hath the pious purpose earnestly at heart!</P>
<P>But his hopes were not so much in the present generation, as in the succeeding. It was an easier task, he found, to prevent vice than to correct it; to form the young to virtue, than to amend the bad habits of the old: He employed much of his time, therefore, in endeavouring to improve the minds of the younger part of his parish; suffering none to grow up in ignorance of their duty, but pressing it as the wisest part to mix religion with their labour, and amidst the cares of this life, to have a constant eye upon the next. He attended to every thing which he con∣ceived might be of service to his parishioners. He was assiduous to prevent all law suits. His hall, it is said, was often thronged with people, who came to submit their differences to his judgment. He was not much acquainted with law, but
<PB N="552" REF="583"/>
could decide equitably, and that satisfied: Nor could his sovereign's commission have given him more weight than his own character. His hospitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country. He spent in his family every fortnight forty bushels of corn, twenty bushels of malt, and a whole ox, besides a proportionable quantity of other kinds of provision. Strangers and travellers found in his house a chearful reception: All were welcome that came; and even their horses had so much care taken of them, that it was humorously said, <Q>If a horse was turned loose in any part of the country, it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton's.</Q></P>
<P>Every Sunday, from Michaelmas till Easter, was a sort of public day with him. During this season he expected to see all his parishioners and their families. For their reception he had three tables well covered: The first was for gentlemen, the second for husbandmen and farmers, and the third for day labourers. This piece of hospitality he never omitted, even at seasons when its continuance was rather difficult to him: He thought it his duty, and that was a deciding motive. When he was absent from home, no alteration was made in his family expences: The poor were fed as usual, and his neighbours entertained: And he was always glad of the company of men of merit and learning, who greatly frequented his house.</P>
<P>When lord Burleigh, then lord treasurer, was sent by queen Elizabeth to transact some affairs in Scotland, that celebrated statesman resolved, on his re∣turn, to pay a visit to Mr Gilpin. Amidst the hurry of this journey he could not resist the desire of seeing a man whose name was every where so respectfully men∣tioned. His free discourse from the pulpit to king Edward's court, had early re∣commended him to this noble person; from which time the great distance between them had wholly interrupted their acquaintance. Lord Burleigh's return was so sudden, that he had no time to give any notice of his intended visit. But the oeconomy of so plentiful a house as Mr Gilpin's was not easily disconcerted. He received his noble guest with so much politeness, and treated him and his whole retinue in so affluent a manner, that the treasurer would often say, <Q>he could hardly have expected more at Lambeth.</Q></P>
<P>While lord Burleigh staid at Houghton, he took great pains to acquaint himself with the order and regularity with which every thing was managed. The house contained a very large family; and was besides continually crowded with persons of all kinds, gentlemen, scholars, workmen, farmers, and poor people: Yet there was never any confusion; every one was conducted to a proper apartment, and entertained, directed, or relieved, as his particular business required. He could not but please this wise lord, who was so well acquainted with the effects of order and regularity in the highest sphere, to observe them even in this humble one. Here too he saw true simplicity of manners, and every social virtue regulated by exact prudence. The statesman began to unbend; and he could scarcely avoid compar∣ing, with a kind of envious eye, the unquiet scenes of vice and vanity at which he was frequently present, with the calmness of this amiable retreat. At length with reluctance he took his leave; and with all the warmth of affection, em∣bracing his much respected friend, told him, <Q>He had heard great things in his
<PB N="553" REF="584"/>
commendation, but had now seen what far exceeded all that he had heard. If, added he, Mr Gilpin, I can ever be of any service to you, at court, or elsewhere, use me with all freedom as one you may depend on.</Q> When he had got to Rainton-hill, which rises about a mile from Houghton, and commands the vale, he turned his horse to take once more a view of the place; and having kept his eye fixed upon it for some time, his reverie broke out into this exclamation: <Q>There is the enjoyment of life indeed! Who can blame that man for not ac∣cepting a bishopric! What doth he want to make him greater, or happier, or more useful to mankind!</Q></P>
<P>Mr Gilpin continued to discharge the duties of his ministerial office in the most conscientious, benevolent, and laborious manner. But notwithstanding all this painful industry, and the large scope it had in so extended a parish, he thought the sphere of his benevolence yet too confined. It grieved him to see in the ad∣jacent parishes so much ignorance and superstition, occasioned by the shameful neglect of the pastoral care in the clergy of those parts. He was induced to supply, as far as he was able, what was wanting in others. For this purpose every year he regularly visited the most neglected parishes in Northumberland, York∣shire, Cheshire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland; and that his own parish, in the mean time, might not suffer, he was at the expence of a constant assistant. In each place he stayed two or three days; and his method was, to call the people about him, and lay before them, in as plain a way as possible, the danger of leading wicked, or even careless lives; explaining to them the nature of true religion; in∣structing them in the duties they owed to God, their neighbour, and themselves; and shewing them how greatly a moral and religious conduct would contribute to their present, as well as future happiness.</P>
<P>As Mr Gilpin had all the warmth of an enthusiast, though under the direction of a very calm and sober judgment, he never wanted an audience, even in the wildest parts; where he roused many to a sense of religion, who had contracted the most inveterate habits of inattention to every thing of a serious nature. Where∣ever he came, he used to visit the gaols and places of consinement, few in the kingdom having at that time any appointed minister; and by his labours, and af∣fectionate manner of behaviour, is said to have reformed many very abandoned persons in those places. He likewise employed his interest for criminals, whose cases were attended with any hard circumstances, and often procured pardons.</P>
<P>Redesdale and Tinedale, in Northumberland, of all barbarous places in the north, were at that time looked upon to be the most barbarous; before the Union, the common theatre where the Scots and English were continually acting their bloody scenes: Inhabited by a kind of desperate banditti, rendered fierce and active by constant rapine, warfare, and alarms; they lived by theft, and used to plunder on both sides of the barrier. In this dreadful country, where no man would then even travel that could help it, Mr Gilpin never failed to spend some part of the year. He generally chose the Christmas holidays for this journey, because he found the people at that season disengaged, and most easily assembled. He had set places for preaching, which were regularly attended. If he came where there
<PB N="554" REF="585"/>
was a church, he made use of it; if not, of barns, or any other large building, where crowds of people were sure to follow him, some for his instructions, and others for his charity.</P>
<P>The disinterested pains he took among those barbarous people, and the good offices he was always ready to do them, drew from them the warmest and sincerest expressions of gratitude. Indeed he was little less than adored among them. One instance that is related, shews how greatly he was revered: By the carelessness of his servant, his horses were one day stolen: The news was quickly propagated, and every one expressed the highest indignation at the fact. The thief was rejoicing over his prize, when by the report of the country he found whose horses he had taken. Terrified at what he had done, he instantly came trembling back, confessed the fact, and returned the horses.</P>
<P>We have already spoken of Mr Gilpin's generous and hospitable manner of liv∣ing. The value of his rectory was about four hundred pounds a year: An in∣come at that time very considerable, but yet in appearance very unproportionate to the generous things he did: Indeed he could not have done them, unless his frugality had been equal to his generosity. His friends, therefore, wondered to find him, amidst his many great and continual expences, entertaining the design of building and endowing a grammar school: A project, however, which his exact oeconomy soon enabled him to accomplish, though the expence of it amounted to upwards of five hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<HEAD>The statutes of the school.</HEAD>
<P>It would be useless to incumber the work with a full transcript of the statutes; the following material parts must suffice:</P>
<P><Q>When the schoole doth want a master the governors may send to Mr Provost of Queen's Col. Ox. and re∣quest him that he would procure some northerne man in any wise master of art, either in his own house or some other, &amp;c.</Q> Then follow rules for conducting the school, &amp;c. and the restrictions upon the mas∣ter, <HI>inter al's,</HI> <Q>He shall meddle with and occupy no other temporal livings, &amp;c. shall let his gillie-tithes to the most advantage he can, provided that he shall not let his tithes above three years, reserving no less rent than with the rest belonging to him will make up yearly his 20l. wage; and also he shall not take any fine before hand. And if any other livings belong to him, he shall farm them forth to others, that they may be no hindrance to his teaching; yet if it so happen that he shall take any spiritual living, then he shall not have the benefit of his school above one year after his induction.</Q> Then followeth an order touching the master's marriage, which is to be with the consent of both governors and two justices of the peace.</P>
<P>Rules concerning the usher follow in this place. <Q>His election shall be wholly in the governors' hands, unless by special authority and direction unto the master there be power granted to him from the governors to choose,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>There shall be one play day in a week, either Tuesday or Thursday, save only certain days in the spring, for the scholars to exercise their bowes, in matching either with themselves or strangers, in the Ox∣pasture or in Houghton-moor, &amp;c.</Q> At times of breaking up the scholars <Q>must pay to their master every one a penny for <HI>ferelatoc</HI> silver, and none shall be inforced to give more, but upon their own good will.</Q></P>
<P>"There shall be a register book, &amp;c. which once a year shall be brought to the governors, &amp;c." And then if the governors can charge the master or usher, by proof or testimony <Q>of the country, by the church wardens of Houghton, by the gentlemen, of negligence in teaching, of misbehaviour, of breach of any sta∣tute, either to punish them by fine, &amp;c. or otherwise, if their faults be intolerable and notorious, to expel them of their livings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Item, there is further of the rents, &amp;c. so much as will yearly find five poor scholars and three poor men or women, allowing them 7d. a week, 7d. over which may be divided, &amp;c.</Q></P>

to flourish; and there was so great a resort of young people to it, that in a
<PB N="556" REF="587"/>
little time the town was not able to accomodate them. He put himself, therefore,
<PB N="557" REF="588"/>
to the inconvenience of fitting up a part of his own house for that purpose, where he seldom had fewer than twenty or thirty children. Some of these were the sons of persons of distinction, whom he boarded at easy rates; but the greater part were poor children, whom he not only educated, but cloathed and maintained: He was likewise at the expence of boarding in the town many other poor children, several of whom he brought every year from the different parts where he preached, parti∣cularly Redesdale and Tinedale. For the maintenance of poor scholars, whom he sent to the universities, he yearly set apart sixty pounds. This sum he always ex∣pended, and often more. His common allowance to each scholar was about ten pounds a year, which for a sober youth was at that time a very sufficient mainte∣nance, so that he never maintained fewer than six. By his will it appears, that at his death he had nine upon his list, whom he took care to provide for during their stay at the university.</P>
<P>As to his school, he not only placed able masters in it, procured from Oxford, but likewise constantly inspected it himself. And that encouragement might quicken the application of his boys, he always took particular notice of the most forward: He would call them his own scholars, send for them often into his study,
<PB N="558" REF="589"/>
and there instruct them himself. One method used by him to fill his school was a little singular. Besides those whom he sent from his own school to the universi∣ties, and there wholly maintained, he likewise gave to others, who were in circum∣stances to do something for themselves, what farther assistance they needed. By which means he induced many parents to allow their children a liberal education, who otherwise would not have done it. He considered himself as their proper guardian, and esteemed himself bound to the public for their being made useful members of it, as far as it lay in his power. With this view he held a punctual correspondence with their tutors; and made the youths themselves frequently write to him an account of their studies. So solicitous indeed was he about them, that once every year he made a journey to the universities, to inspect their beha∣viour. And this uncommon, care was not unrewarded; for many of his scholars became ornaments to the church, and exemplary instances of piety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among those of note who were educated by him, these three are particularly mentioned; Henry Ayray, George Carleton, and Hugh Broughton.</P>
<P>Henry Ayray became afterwards provost of Queen's College in Oxford; where he was in great esteem for his abilities, and exemplary life.</P>
<P>George Carleton was a man of worth and learning, and very deservedly promoted to the See of Chichester. He published several pieces, which are enumerated by Anthony Wood, and in particular the life of his bene∣factor Bernard Gilpin.</P>
<P>Hugh Broughton was a very learned man, and particularly skilled in rabbinical learning. Broughton is said to have been so laboriously studious, that unless he were prevented by something very extraordinary, he studied twelve or fourteen hours, and often sixteen hours a day. He had a contest with Theodore Beza. He died in 1662, as we are told by the famous Dr Lightfoot, who declares himself a child in comparison of this great master of Hebrew and rabbinical learning, and mentions an offer that was once made to him of a car∣dinal's hat.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Every Thursday throughout the year he caused a very large quantity of meat to be dressed, wholly for the poor; and every day they had what quantity of broth they wanted. Twenty-four of the poorest were his constant pensioners. Four times in the year a dinner was provided for them, when they received from his steward a certain quantity of corn, and a sum of money; and at Christmas they had always an ox divided among them.</P>
<P>In the distant parishes where he preached, as well as in his own neighbourhood, his generosity and benevolence were continually shewing themselves; particularly in the desolate parts of Northumberland. <Q>When he began his journey, (says an old manuscript life of him) he would have ten pounds in his purse, and at his coming home he would be twenty nobles in debt, which he would always pay within a fortnight after.</Q> In the gaols he visited he was not only careful to give the prisoners proper instructions, but used also to purchase for them such necessaries as they wanted.</P>
<P>Of his benevolent temper the following instance is preserved. One day return∣ing home, he saw in a field several people crowding together, and judging some∣thing more than ordinary had happened, he rode up, and found that one of the horses in a team had suddenly dropped down, which they were endeavouring to raise, but in vain, for the horse was dead. The owner of it seemed much dejected with his misfortune; and declaring how grievous a loss it would be to him, Mr Gilpin bade him not to be disheartened; "I'll let you have," says he, <Q>honest
<PB N="559" REF="590"/>
man, that horse of mine,</Q> and pointed to his servant's. "Ah! master," re∣plied the countryman, "my pocket will not reach such a beast as that." <Q>Come, come,</Q> said Mr Gilpin, <Q>take him, take him; and when I demand my money, then thou shalt pay me.</Q></P>
<P>Towards the latter part of his life, Mr Gilpin went through his duty with great difficulty. His health was much impaired; for the fatigue he had undergone so many years had broken his constitution. Thus he complains in a letter to his friend: <Q>To sustain all these travels and troubles I have a very weak body, subject to many diseases; by the monitions whereof I am daily warned to remember death. My greatest grief of all is, that my memory is quite decayed: My sight faileth; my hearing faileth; with other ailments, more than I can well express.</Q> While he was thus struggling with an advanced age, and much impaired constitu∣tion, there happened a very unfortunate affair, which entirely distroyed his health. As he was crossing the market-place at Durham, an ox ran at him, and pushed him down with such violence, that it was imagined the bruises he received would have occasioned his death. He lay long confined; and though he again got abroad, he never recovered the little strength he had before, and continued lame as long as he lived. But sickness was not the only distress which the declining years of this ex∣cellent man had to struggle with. As age and infirmity began to lessen the weight and influence he once possessed, the malice and opposition of his enemies prevailed more: And he experienced much ingratitude and ill usage, at a time when he was already sinking under a weight of cares.</P>
<P>His pious resignation under such evils was not long exercised. About the be∣ginning of February, 1583, finding himself very weak, and sensible his end must be drawing near, he told his friends his apprehensions, and spoke of his death with that happy composure which attends the conclusion of a good life. He was soon after confined to his chamber; but his senses continued perfect to the last. A few days before his death he desired his friends, acquaintance, and dependents might be called into his chamber; and being raised in his bed, he addressed himself to them in a very pathetic manner, earnestly exhorting them to the practice of piety and virtue. He also sent far several persons who had hitherto made no good use of his advice, and upon whom he imagined his dying words might have a better effect. But his speech began to saulter before he had finished his exhortations. The re∣maining hours of his life he spent in prayer, and conversation with some select friends, mentioning often the consolations of Christianity; declaring they were the only true ones, and that nothing else could bring a man peace at the last. He died on the 4th of March, 1583, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.</P>
<P>He is described to have been tall of stature, slender, and hawk-nosed. In his diet he was temperate, or rather abstemious. His parts were good; his imagination, memory, and judgment lively, retentive, and solid. His acquirements were con∣siderable; for by unwearied application he had gained so great a store of know∣ledge, that his biographers have said he was ignorant of no part of learning at that time in esteem. In languages, history, and divinity, he particularly excelled. He read poetry with a good taste; and was himself, according to bishop Charleton, no
<PB N="560" REF="591"/>
mean poet. His temper was naturally warm; and in his youth he sometimes gave way to passion; but at length he entirely corrected that infirmity. His disposition was naturally serious; yet among his particular friends he was chearful, and some∣times facetious. His general behaviour was very affable. His severity had no object but himself; to others he was humble, candid, and indulgent. He had ex∣traordinary skill in the art of managing a fortune; looking upon himself barely as a steward for other people, and observing that his own desires should not exceed what calm reason could justify. Extravagance was considered by him as a species of injustice; and amidst his employments he found leisure to look into his affairs, well knowing that frugality is the support of charity. His intimacies were but few; for it was his endeavour, as the spirit of Christianity required, to dilate rather than to contract his affections: Yet where he professed a particular friendship, Mr Gilpin was a religious observer of its offices: Was the most candid interpreter of the words and actions of others. Where he plainly saw failings, would make every possible allowance for them: Used to express a particular indignation at slander; often saying, it more deserved the gallows than theft: Was remarkably guarded when he spoke of others; considering common fame as the falsest medium, and a man's reputation as his most valuable property: Ever displayed the greatest sincerity, as well as humility, in his transactions with others: But the principal virtues, and distinguishing parts of his character, were his conscientious discharge of the ministerial office, extensive benevolence, and exalted piety. The constant tenor of his life was so uniformly agreeable to the strictest rules of morality and religion, that it gained him among his contemporaries the title of the Northern Apostle. In his charitable distributions, he had no measure but the bounds of his income, of which the least portion was always laid out on himself: Was the more particularly careful to give away in his life time whatever could be saved for the poor, as he had often seen and regretted the abuse of posthumous charities. <Q>It is my design, at my departure, (said he, writing to a friend) to leave no more behind me than what will serve to bury me, and pay my debts.</Q> What little remained he left wholly to the poor, except a few slight tokens of remembrance bequeathed to his friends. His uncommon benevolence made him deservedly stiled the father of the poor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the rebellion of the earl of Westmoreland, Mr Gilpin retired to Oxford, and in his absence the rebels who had possessed Durham, scattered themselves as far as Houghton, and seized his barns and cattle, the chief of the plunderers being a person whom he had saved from the gallows. On Mr Gilpin's return his in∣tercessions saved from execution many of the poor deluded vassals, who bad followed their lords.</P>

<P>"And as to the arrears of rent, and all sum and sums of money, which shall be due at or after my decease out of my several spiritual promotions, I give and dispose thereof as follows: To the poor of the parish of St Oswald's in Durham, the sum of 20l. To the poor of the parish of Houghton-in-the-Spring, the like sum of 20l. And if it happens that there shall be any sum or sums of money remaining of the arrears of my said spiritual promotions, either in the dean and chapter's hands, parish of St Oswald's, or Houghton or any of them, over and above what is so bequeathed to be paid out of my said spiritual promotions, I bequeath all such sum and sums of money to my successor to the parish of Houghton aforesaid, in trust that he shall there∣with buy a piece of land, or dispose of it to interest; the rent or interest of which I will shall be equally di∣vided between the schoolmaster and usher of the said town of Houghton for the time being, and the poor of that part of the alms house which was built by my predecessor Mr Geo. Davenport, to be laid out in cloaths and other necessaries, as my said successor shall think fit."</P>
<P>N. B. At Sir Geo. Wheler's death there remained of his spiritual promotions, besides what he had be∣queathed to be paid out of the said arrears, the sum of 589l. 2s. 1½d. and which was paid to Dr Seeker, the immediate successor in the rectory of Houghton, at different times whilst he was rector there, subject to the trust in Sir Geo. Wheler's will. Dr Secker did, with 586l. 13s. 4d. part of the said sum, and with the sum of 293l. 6s. 8d. the money of John Smailes, of East Rainton, maltster, making together 880l. purchase of John Brough, a farmhold in the township of East Rainton, for the remainder of a term of 21 years, holden by lease under the dean and chapter of Durham at the yearly rent of 2l. 13s. 4d.</P>
<P>15th Oct. 1726. John Brough, and William Brough his brother, a legatee named in the will of John Brough their father, assign the said lease and premisses to Dr Secker, and it being agreed upon the purchase, that two-thirds in value of the premisses should be allotted to Dr Secker in trust, the money advanced by him being two-thirds of the purchase money, and the rest of the premisses being one-third, should be allotted to John Smailes. Dr Secker, by an indorsement on the said assignment, dated the 29th July, 1727, declared that all that part of the premisses on the west side of the common lane leading to and from Durham, the man∣sion-house, barn, stack-garth, and fold, the east part of the house called the Redhouse, with the appurtenances were taken in Dr Secker's name, in trust for the school master and usher of the said town of Houghton.</P>

<P>Whereas I have surrendered into the hands of the lord of the manor of Houghton aforesaid, according to the custom thereof, my two copyhold closes, situate lying and being in Houghton aforesaid, commonly called the Broad Meadows and Slipper Thorn, with the appurtenances, to the use of Mr Ra.

In pursuance thereof I do hereby devise, direct, and appoint, and limit, that the said Ra. Gowland and Rob.

And my will is, that the yearly sum of forty shillings be given to Mr Davenport's part of the hospital of Houghton aforesaid, for ever, and the yearly overplus or profits of the said closes over and above the said sum of seven pounds per annum, and taxes and out rents, I will and hereby devise, that my servant Rob.

A. vicar of Sherburn in Dorsetshire, and a native of this parish, intended to be a con∣siderable benefactor to this alms house. But finding his death approaching, and wishing to avoid the inter∣ference of the mortmain act, he desisted from his purpose of bequeathing a legacy to this and other charitable uses in his parish, and determined to leave his estate to a near relation, Miss Dorothy Spearman of Durham, with a paper containing hints of the several charities he had in view. But drawing up his will himself, with∣out the help of a person skilled in the law, it appeared that Miss Spearman had only her life in the estate, and that it would pass at her decease to Mr Sharp's heir at law. This induced Miss Spearman, upon considering his several intended charities, and finding those to the alms house to be the most useful and considerable, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> generosity, immediately to purchase 600l, stock in the 3 per cent. consolidated annuities, and to settle it upon Mr Lilburn's end of the alms house, by which it is raised in value to an equality with the other parts of the alms house. This is recorded on a stone now fixed on the north end of the alms house, in the fol∣lowing terms: <Q>The charitable intention of the reverend William Sharp, M.

They wrought twenty days in harvest, with one man for each, and harrowed eight days, with one horse for every two ox-gangs: They made four portions like the tenants of Wardon, with all their families, except the housewife, besides the twenty days work in autumn, and they carted or led six days hay and corn, and carried eight loads yearly to Durham or Auckland of the lord's baggage. For every carucate of land, they plowed one acre at Houghton, and rendered for each ox-gang one hen and five eggs. In Hatfield's Survey they are called bond tenants, and the service of carriage is there explained to be either for the lord or his seneschal; and that they performed the usual work at the mill. The office of punder was executed among themselves, for which they paid annual∣ly xx hens and 100 eggs.

By the Boldon Book it seems as if this manor had anciently appertained to the See of Durham; for it is thereby stated, that the villains of South-Bedic held their vill in firm, rendering five pounds rent, and providing eight score men at harvest, and thirty-six carriages to lead corn at Houghton. But in the second year of bishop Bury, by an inquisition taken on the death of Alianora de Colleye, it appears she died seised of the manor of South-Bedyk, juxta Newbotelle, held of the bishop <HI>in capite,</HI> by homage, fealty, and the quarter part of a knight's see, with suit at the county; so that it seems from thence the manor had been aliened from the See<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>South-Bedic.</HI></P>

It appears that this was of dringage service, as the holder fed dog and horse in proportion to two parts of a dringe. In bishop Beaumont's time John Denum was possessed of Woodhall in West Herrington, with a carucate of land and five acres of wood, held of the bishop <HI>in capite;</HI> and also Roger de Eshe was seised of East Herrington and Middle Herrington, and John D'Arcy of West Her∣rington,

under whom Denum held parcels thereof in East Herrington, by homage, fealty, and suit of court, and service at the mill, under a thirtieth part mulcture, and in Middle Herrington by dringage service: For lands in West Herrington he did homage and fealty to D'Arcy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Inq. p. m.

And that he and those holding under him, should follow the lords court called the halmote, and there plead and be impleaded, and receive right and justice. We find thereby that a family had assumed the local name, and that Thomas de Herrington held lands of inheritance there by foreign service, as much as appertained to two parts of a dringe, attending the bishop's great or forest chace with two parts of two greyhounds, leading two parts of a ton of wine, attending the court, serving in the bishop's embassies, feeding dog and horse, and working at the mill as the custom was. Colvyll also, in his wife's right, held a place called Hayning, containing by estimation 100 acres. Will. Robinson also in this early period, held a messuage and two oxgangs of land there.

<P>The next place, in the arrangement of the book of rates, is NEWBOTTLE, a beautiful village on a fine elevated situation, a little to the north-west of Houghton. In the Boldon Book it is set forth, that Newbottle consisted of sixteen cottagers, who each held twelve acres of land, and worked two days in every week through∣out the year, made four portions of land in autumn, in which work all the family except the housewife, were to labour, and each cottager rendered one hen and five eggs. There were three other cottagers, who held six acres each, and wrought two days in the week between Pentecost and Martinmass. The greve or head∣borough, and smith, had each twelve acres, their fee of service, and the punder had twelve acres, and also a thrave of corn from every carucate of land in Newbottle, Biddick, and Herrington, and rendered 40 hens and ccc eggs. The demesne, which consisted of four carucates of land, with the sheep and pasture, were then in the bishop's hands. Hugh Boynton, with sundry others, held the demesne lands at the time of Hatfield's Survey, containing 312 acres.

<BIBL><HI>Hatfield's Survey.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. In our attention to the city of Durham certain con∣jectures were formed touching the tradition, that Wardon hill was the ground where St Cuthbert's remains were miraculously staid on the return from Ripon, previous to the settlement at Durham; in that place were noted the uncertain evi∣dence of ancient writers, and we presumed to give an opinion, that Wardon was not the place pointed out by the writers of antiquity. Those who treat of our church history do not mention that any particular veneration was paid to the saint's resting place, till the time of prior Hugh of Darlington, who built a camera, a hall, and chapel at Wardelau, or Wadele. Wardon was from very early times part of the possessions of the See, but never of the convent, so that the prior had no right to enter therein, and build a lodge or hall for the use of the cloister. The hill of Wardon is a considerable eminence, rising gradually from all sides but towards the east, where it is more steep: There are no remains of buildings to be discover∣ed on any part of it. The similitude of name to that of the place mentioned by old writers, has led to the error; but if we consider the names Wardon and Wardona, we shall be led into two probable conjectures touching their etymology, either that the eminence commanding an extensive prospect by sea and land, was the station of the warden of the north, in some conflicts with the Danes or Scots, and was called the Warden's Law, or Mount; or that this being a mark and guide for sailors, when the small vessels of the ancients kept close under the shores, and for want of the compass dared not in dark weather to trust themselves to an open and stormy sea, it was the point of view which struck the eye on passing the pro∣montory of Flamborough or Souter Point, and guided to the mouth of the river Were, gaining thereby the name of Were-Dun, or the Hill of Were. It is left to the reader to judge of these conjectures, we having discovered no degree of evi∣dence to support the tradition, that by miraculous interposition, here began the leading events which were to aggrandize the present city of Durham.</P>

<P>MOOR HOUSE appears to have been part of the possessions of the Lumleys in bishop Langley's time<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. Joh. de Lomley. A<SUP>o</SUP> 15 bishop Langley.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COKEN, the seat of Ralph Carr, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> lies in this parish, on the banks of the river Were, where the river forms a beautiful curvature, almost to enclose the en∣chanting scene. The mansion-house is ancient, but the situation elevated and fine. Mr Pennant, from some inadvertency, speaks of it as being the seat of St Godric's austerities; Finchale, where the hermitage stood, being on the opposite side of the river. We repeat part of the description given by that judicious traveller. <Q>12 July, saw Coken, the seat of Mr Carr; a most romantic situation, laid out with great judgment: The walks are very extensive, principally along the sides or at the bottom of great dells, bounded with vast precipices, finely wooded; and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines and other fruit trees, which I was told bore well, but late. The river Were winds along the hollows, and forms two very fine reaches, at the place where you enter these walks. Its waters are very clear, and its bottom a solid rock. The view towards the ruins of Finchal abbey is remarkably great; and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent solemnity, a sit retreat for its monastic inhabitants. This was once called the Desert, and was the rude scene of the austerities of St Godric, who carried them to the most senseless extravagance. A sober mind may even at present be affected with horror at the prospect from the summits of the cliffs into a darksome and stupendous chasm, rendered still more tremendous by the roaring of the waters over its distant bottom.</Q> The house and adjacent grounds are situated on an eminence, on three sides washed by the river, and towards the east bounded by deep dells, filled with stately forest trees. The southern side of this peninsula is laid out in pleasure grounds; one wide and extended terrace runs along the summit of the cliffs, another at their feet: From the upper terrace fine openings in the wood afford prospects of the adjacent lands; and in one point of view, you look down upon the solemn vale scattered with the ruins of the mona∣stery
<PB N="572" REF="603"/>
and abbey. The lower terrace is formed on the shelves of the rocky shore, from whence the cliffs rise perpendicular near an hundred feet, crowned with hanging oaks, which strike their roots into the fissures of the rock, and stretch a solemn umbrage over the walk. From this terrace the ruins of the religious edifice appear in all their majestic beauties, shut in by rising grounds fringed with woods; the river falls over a rocky channel in troubled streams, and the murmurs of the waters are repeated by a soothing echo. For religious contemplation, recluse piety, and self-denial, never was place better adapted; much pity it was ever dis∣graced by unmeaning severity and hypocrisy! Various are the beautiful scenes this walk affords; description is languid; to visit the place is the only means of forming ideas of its picturesque excellencies. Proceeding along the eastern side of the eminence, the walk is carried on the summit of a deep and wooded dell, which relieves the eye for some time before you enter upon the northern rocks, which are shaken, rugged, and truly august; mighty volumes hang over your head, as if the wind which shook the oaks would rend the precipice and tumble it into the vale. Several deep grottos formed by nature, are shadowed with trees suspended from their roof; hasty streams fall from the cliffs, and with a hollow clamour increase the pleasing solemnity of the vast scene. The river forms a canal near a mile in length, through an avenue of rocks and hanging forests; the spire of Chester church the terminating object. The woods are noble, consisting chiefly of oaks of a great age: Nature has lavished beauties on this place, and what art has done with an excellent taste, has smoothed her brow where art was wanted, and opened to the eye those beauties her wildness would otherwise have concealed. In the time of bishop Galfrid, one Aellafus, a priest, gave Coken to the church of Dur∣ham. This is to be understood only of part of the territory now called Coken. The first lay person we find in the ancient records possessed of lands in Coken, is Alexander de Kibblesworth, of whom the family of Birtley, in bishop Hatfield's time, held lands there; they also held other lands in Coken of the priory of Dur∣ham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. William son of Wahanc de Birtley, A<SUP>o</SUP> 21 Hatfield.</NOTE>. Alexander held of the prior of Finchale a moiety of the vill of Coken<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. Alex. de Kibblesworth.

In this inq. it is said he held a moiety of the vill of Coken of the lord prior of Durham, rendering a pound of pepper.</NOTE>; on the death of John his son, the family possessions fell to five daughters his co∣heiresses. The Lumleys had lands there in bishop Langley's time.</P>
<P>OFFERTON was one of the places given by Athelstan to the See of Durham, as an appendage of Weremouth. In bishop Beaumont's time the vill of Offerton was the possession of John de Denum<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. John de Denum, A<SUP>o</SUP> 10, Beaumont.</NOTE>; but from that period we find few traces of it in the records. The mansion-house, the seat of Francis Middleton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> lately de∣ceased, is pleasantly situated on the brow of a hill, commanding an extensive pros∣pect up the valley north-eastward.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Parish of</HI> DALTON,</HEAD>
<P>properly called DALTON-LE-DALE, the small village with the church lying in a very deep and narrow valley, within a mile of the sea: The scenes are romantic, but for want of wood, are deficient in that richness which is so pleasing in the vallies further from the ocean. The church is small, and without ailes. There are two table monuments in the chancel, one with a recumbent effigy in stone, of a person in armour, but without an inscription.</P>
<P>Nearer to the sea lies DALDEN; the vale still deep and narrow, with some little wood, which fringes the margin of the brook: The old tower or house of Dalden is in ruins, and so much destroyed as to furnish no idea of its former consequence: From the situation it appears to have been merely strengthened against wandering robbers. Dalden gave name to a resident family so early as bishop Hatfield's time, when we find William de Dalden held the manor of the lord de Percy, by homage, fealty, and a knight's fee, for which the lord Percy made suit at the bishop's county<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. 25 Hatfield.</NOTE>.

There were thirty-one villains, who held their lands, and performed their services like those of Boldon. By that record it appears there were only two free tenants, Simon and Galfrid Cokesmaht, who held each half a carucate of land, and served on the bish∣op's embassies. The carpenter, smith, and punder each held lands for their services, and the two vills rendered 30s. cornage, and provided two milch cows. The
<PB N="576" REF="609"/>
demesne was let out, but the pasture and sheep stock were in the hands of the bishop. In bishop Bury's time we find one John Fairey was possessed of a messuage and a parcel of land in Easington, held of the bishop <HI>in capite,</HI> by the singular ser∣vice of <Q>aiding the bishop's bailiff to drive goods distrained, attesting summonses, and superintending the carriage of a dole of wine annually.</Q> This family held their small possession for some ages. In Hatfield's Survey the free tenants are named, and all performed the service of embassy. The demesne lands are therein stated to be upwards of 300 acres. It appears there were only twenty-nine bond tenants, who occupied thirty-two messuages, each holding two oxgangs of land, computing fifteen acres to an oxgang, and paying for work xi s. ix d. for aid, scat, or scac. pennys, and plow-pennys, at the feast of the Virgin 19d. for scot∣pennys, called by the tenants in that district malt-pennys 15 d. and for aver or plow-pennys at the two feasts of St Cuthbert, the feast of the Nativity, and John the Baptist 12d. for woodloads 8d. and at the feast of the Purification six bushels of lot oats, at the feast of the Nativity two hens, at the Passover ten eggs; and in lieu of other work 13 d. They also paid 30s. cornage, 40s. for castlemen, 12s. in lieu of one milch cow, and carried a ton of wine. In the service of the cottagers was that of collecting the hens, and carrying them to the bishop's manors. The parcels of freehold in Thorp and Easington being very small, it would not be a profitable labour to trace a succession of possessors, we find among them the Guys, Daltons, and Claxtons.</P>
<P>The town of Easington stands on an elevated situation, the land gradually in∣clining towards the sea. At the upper end of the town, on an eminence, is the church, a lofty building; a sea mark for mariners. The chancel of this church is twelve paces long and six wide, with three steps ascending to the table; is ceiled, stuccoed, and neatly wainscotted, with some tabernacle work above the table. The east window is formed of three lights, under a pointed arch, with rose work tracery; and there are three windows to the south, of two lights each, under point∣ed arches. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch, rising from corbles, and closed with a neat screen, ornamented with foliage and open work in oak. You descend by four steps into the nave, the length of which is eighteen

paces; divided uniformly by two side ailes, formed by three pillars on each side, supporting pointed arches, the whole width being thirteen paces; the pillars are light; on the south side two are octagonal and one round, and on the north side two round and one octagonal: The capitals are formed by two tresses of square projections, and one roll, which hath a good effect. The pulpit is supported by the first south pillar. The belfry rises on a circular arch, and the tower is about sixty feet in height. The nave is lighted by three windows in the south aile, and four upper windows on each side of the center aile; and is stalled with oak, orna∣mented with fleur-de-lis. In the south aile is a burial vault for the family of Conyers of Horden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>On a mural monument, above the Horden seats.</HI></P>

<P>HAWTHORN, in the time of bishop Beaumont, was the estate of the Merleys and Beanfours; and by an inquisition taken in the tenth year of that prelate, it appears that Ralph de Merley died seised of lands there, held of William de Merley <HI>in capite,</HI> by homage and fealty, and a pound of cumin, and other lands held of the heirs of Ralph Beanfour, rendering a pound of pepper, or 8 d. and also the manor of

<BIBL><HI>Records at Durham.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> The town of Hawthorn is pleasantly situated on a dry hill, within half a mile of the sea: The shore is rocky, and broken into a multitude of deep caverns: The offing is full of rocks and shoals, so that in stormy weather it is tremendous to mariners, whilst the heavy breaker shakes the sounding coast. In the mouth of a deep and narrow creek, where the rocks are the most broken, rugged, and romantic, admiral Mil∣banke built a summer retreat, which he called Sailor's Hall; at high tide it almost hangs over the waves, and looks upon the most stormy and shaken part of the shore. The placidness of a summer evening's calm, when the moon is reflected on the smooth bosom of the ocean, is highly pleasing to the contemplative eye; but when the storm lifts the distracted waves, with a horrid gloom confounds the ele∣ments, and mixes the spray even with the clouds; when the winds groan in the caverns, and the hoarse billows thunder along the beach; when the shrill cries of distress and wreck strike the ear from wretches without succour; when the af∣frighted cattle bellowing leave the hills, and driving showers sweep the disconsolate landscape, little remains to make such a situation eligible. On the south side of Hawthorn-dean is an eminence called the Beacon Hill, where fires were formerly raised, to keep mariners at a distance from this dangerous coast.</P>
<P><PB N="583" REF="616"/>In this part of the country are retained some ancient customs evidently derived from the Romans, particularly that of dressing up a figure of Ceres during harvest, which is placed in the field whilst the reapers are labouring, and brought home on the last evening of reaping, with music and great acclamation.

width: On the north side are two arches, now built up, which shew it formerly was of greater extent. The east end is lighted by three long narrow windows; but to the south is a large window, ornamented with tracery. The chancel is separated from the nave by a heavy round arch without ornament. The body or nave of the church has two side ailes, and is in length about eighteen paces, the ailes being little more than three paces wide: The south aile has undergone much alteration; the pillars have been restored in modern times, and support five pointed arches: Three windows, of two lights each, under pointed arches, give light to this side. The north aile is also formed by a row of four pillars; that to the east is flat, supporting a pointed arch; the other three are of the old Saxon architecture, short, with plain capitals, the shafts fluted and otherwise ornamented: They sup∣port four circular arches, ornamented with the zig-zag mouldings, and seem to be of nearly the same date as the nave of Durham cathedral: This aile is lighted with two windows under pointed arches. The tower is low, and supported by but∣tresses, forming an oblong square of five paces east and west, and seven paces north and south. In the yard are two remarkable monuments of personages un∣known. The one is the recumbent effigy of a man in armour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide cut of monument in Whitworth church yard, exactly similar to this: One of the effigies in Chester church is also like it.</NOTE>, the visor having only a transverse gash or aperture: The sword in the right hand, with the point elevated to the visor, and the shield on the left arm covering the breast.

<P>Among the pious works of the opulent prelate Hugh de Puteaco, or Pudsey, there is none surviving to this age of such importance as the foundation of Sherburn hospital, designed for the reception of sixty-five poor lepers, with a master and other officers to superintend the same, which great and godly work he effected about the year 1181, when that dreadful malady prevailed grievously in this land. He dedicated the house to Christ, the Blessed Virgin, Lazarus, and his sisters Mary and Martha <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Shyrburne—Clarus sons Lat. Lel.—Scyreburna, Saxon.—Here is an hospital of poore men, which Hugh Puteac, the joly byshop of Durham, builded in the reigne of K. Hen. II.—<HI>Lambarde's Topog. Dict. p.</HI> 326.</P>
<P>Our Saxon ancestors dedicated many buildings to what they esteemed pious, and very few to charitable uses solely. Bishop Tanner has not noticed so many as six established by them; but we ought not to con∣clude, from this omission, that they were regardless of their fellow creatures labouring under the various calamities incident to human nature, who were unable to help themselves. In general, the poor were sup∣ported by the religious societies, and the members of each were enjoined by the rules of their respective orders, and the express directions of their founders and benefactors, to relieve the wants and distresses not only of the necessitous and infirm in their neighbourhood, but of travelling people also. From neglect or the nauseousness and infection of diseases, the wretchedness of the poor would perhaps not be sufficiently relieved, which induced the benevolent to found hospitals for the more immediate and greater relief of dis∣tempered objects. Within 100 years after the Conquest, 59 hospitals were erected in this kingdom; and before the end of the reign of Henry III. they were increased to 131.</P>
<P>The leprosy was a disorder very prevalent in Europe during the tenth and eleventh centuries; and its spreading was doubtless the cause of establishing many hospitals. Some persons have conjectured that in Christendom they amounted to 15000 in number; but without assenting to so vague a calculation, it is cer∣tain, that in England there was hardly a large city, or a capital town, near which there was not one at least of these lazar-houses erected: We indeed find none within the walls, for as the distemper was so violent as to be judged infectious, the afflicted persons were denied all public commerce.</P>
<P>Hospitals were originally designed for the relief and entertainment of travellers upon the road, and parti∣cularly of pilgrims, and therefore were generally built by the way-side.—<HI>Burn's Eccl. Law, vol. ii. p.</HI> 455.</P>
<P>From the situation of Sherburn Hospital we may conjecture, that it was partly intended for this benevo∣lent purpose, as well as for the reception of lepers.</P>
<P>The leprosy was much more common in this part of the globe formerly than at present, and perhaps near half the hospitals that were in England were for lepers. At the five gates of Norwich were five houses of this sort; and lepers were so numerous in the twelfth century, that by a decree in the Lateran Council un∣der pope Alexander III. 1179, they were empowered to erect churches for themselves, and to have their own ministers (lepers, we may suppose) to officiate in them. This shews at once how infectious and offensive their distemper was; and on this account, in England, <Q>where a man was a leper, and dwelling in a town, and would come into the church or among his, neighbours, where they were assembled, to talk with them to their annoyance or disturbance, a writ lay▪ <HI>de leproso amovendo.</HI></Q>—<HI>Fitzh. Nat. Brev. p.</HI> 520, 521.</P>
<P>What follows is remarkable. The writ is for those lepers who appear to the sight of all men that they are lepers, by their voice and their sores the putrefaction of their flesh, and by the smell of them. And so late as the reign of Edw. VI. multitudes of lepers seem to have been in England; for in 1 Edw. VI. c. 3, in which directions are given for carrying the poor to the places where they were born, &amp;c. we read the follow∣ing clause: <Q>Provided always that all leprous and poor bedrid creatures may; at their liberty, remain and continue in such houses appointed for lepers or bedrid people as they now be in.</Q>—<HI>Burn's Hist. Poor Laws, p.</HI> 68.</P>
<P>In the reign of Hen. I. the leprosy (by some called <HI>Elephantiasis</HI>) ran by infection all over England, and it is believed that the disease first came into this island out of Egypt, which more than once had spread itself into Europe, first in the days of Pompey the Great, afterwards under Heraclius, and at other times, as may be seen in history, but never (so far as I have read) did it before that time appear in England.—<HI>Camd.

<P>John Newton, of Litchfield diocese, presbyter, was collated to the hospital by bishop Langley, the 19th of January, 1409, void by the cession of Alan de Newark: Was a bad man, and by granting corrodies, annual pensions, and other iniquitious practices, he almost ruined the hospital estate, and shamefully suffered the buildings and out-houses to go to decay: He seems to have been a favourite of bishop Langley, who did not see, or at least connived at his faults and ill conduct in the management of this house.</P>

<P>When Marchall died or resigned we cannot find.

<P>Anthony Bellassis, alias Bellassyse, succeeded Dr Leghe about the year 1545: Was the younger son of Thomas Bellassis of Henknowle in this county, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and ordained a priest by bishop Tunstall the 7th of June, 1533. On the dissolution of the mo∣nasteries he obtained a grant of Newborough abbey, in the county of York, valued at 457l. 13s. 5d. which he afterwards gave to his nephew Sir William Bellassyse, knight, and is now the scat of earl Fauconberg <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Tanner's Notitia.</NOTE>.— Died in July, 1552 <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot"><P>A note of the miserable abusyon of lands and goods given unto the hospital of Sherburn, only for the sustentation of poor people, which is now abused.

<P>Richard Read was of New College, in Oxford, doctor of laws, an able civilian of his time. Anthony Bellasis dying in July, 1552, (the bishop then in prison) Richard Read was put in master by the king, but notwithstanding this the bishop collated in his own right Anthony Salvayn. On bishop Tunstall's restoration Read quietly quit∣ted his pretensions to the hospital, and Anthony Salvayn took possesion thereof.</P>

<P>David Gregory, D. D. the first professor of modern history at Oxford, appointed by king George I. the 18th of August, 1724; was collated by bishop Trevor to this hospital the 15th of September, 1759. His benevolence was diffusive and general; while master of this hospital he did not confine the old men as heretofore to the strict allowance, which good as it might have been when anciently settled on them by their founder, was now become a sad and scanty pittance, but as far as it was in his power, made them enjoy the sense and spirit of the benefaction. He demolished all the little wretched huts in which they were huddled together, and erected a handsome commodious stone edifice, making it to consist of twenty different apartments, that each might have one en∣tirely to himself; and also constructed a large room in the centre of the building for their common reception, and comfortably provided it with every necessary accommodation: For this purpose he cut down and sold a large wood at Ebchester belonging the hospital, as it is said, adequate to the expence. He died the 16th of September, 1767.</P>
<P>Mark Hildesley, D. D. was of Trinity college, Cambridge, and bishop of Sodor and Man. He was collated to this hospital by bishop Trevor, the 21st of September, 1767, and died at Bishop's Court in the Isle of Man, the 7th of December, 1772, aged 74 years.</P>
<P>Thomas Dampier, a native of Somersetshire, educated at Eton school; was a prebendary of Durham, which he resigned on be∣ing collated to this hospital by Dr Egerton, late lord bishop of Durham, wherein he was inducted by proxy the 10th of March, 1773. Installed dean of Durham in June 1774, having before resigned the hospital to his son the present dean of Rochester. He died the 2d of August, 1777.</P>

The east window is new, consisting of five lights and some elegant tracery, with painted glass: In the roses of the upper tracery are the arms of Neville. In the center light is the figure represented on the hospital seal, above which are the arms of lord Crew, and those of the See. The chancel is neatly stalled on each side for the brethren. Within the altar rails towards the south wall is the tomb of Thomas Lever, who died in 1577. The situation of this hospital is remarkably healthful, it is surrounded with dry and fertile lands, and stands about two miles distant from Durham.</P>

<P>Imprimis ergo statuit dictus Hugo episcopus, ut in capella dictae domus ad serviendum Deo et sanctae Mariae Magdalenae et beato Nicholao, sint continue tres sacerdotes et quatuor clerici, duo scilicet ad serviendum altari sanctae Mariae Mag∣dalenae hebdomadario modo, quorum unus hebdomada sua celebrabit cantando missam tempori congruentem et alius hebdomada illa pro fidelibus et vice versa tertius deputabitur officio sancti Nicholai et continue celebrabit pro defunctis, et haec erit missa sororum leprosarum infra quarum domum a latere australi sita est dicta capella.</P>
<P><PB N="602" REF="635"/>Quartum capellanum apposuit tempore suo dictus Ricardus Dunelmensis episco∣pus, quem deputavit officio beatae Mariae Virginis in capella nova quam in hono∣rem beatae Mariae Virginis construxit a latere aquilonari majoris capellae ubi quartus sacerdos cotidie celebrabit missam de beata Maria Virginis cum solempnitate, et haec erit missa fratrum leprosorum et cotidie ultimo celebrabitur, tum propter fratres debiles et mane surgere non valentes, tum propter sacerdotes qui expletis officiis sibi deputatis, omnes dictae missae intererunt. Diebus vero dominicis et in majori∣bus solempnitatibus ultimo celebrabitur magna missa in majori capella ubi omnes intererunt tam clerici quam sacerdotes, et illis diebus tantum aperientur ostia lepro∣sorum tam fratrum quam sororum, ut in domo fratrum omnes conveniant, et in continuo silentio intrabunt et redibunt, praeeunte fratres leprosos eorum priore, et priorissa subsequente sorores leprosas, et sic missa celebrata domum suam intrabunt sorores et claudetur earum ostium.</P>
<P>Statuit etiam dictus Hugo, ut dictae domus procurator semper sacerdos praesi∣ciatur et religiosus, si bonus inveniatur, <HI>vel secullaris si melior inveniatur,</HI> qui dictis sacerdotibus de dictis officiariis in omnibus necessariis providebit, et missam, quam voluerit, et ubi, celebrabit, qui in rectura ita modeste se habeat, ut numerum trium equorum non excedat nisi aliter cogat necessitas. Istorum etiam sacerdotum officiis et eorum sustentamentis, deputati sunt tres clerici vel quatuor, nisi procurator fuerit sacerdos, qui dictis sacerdotibus in divinis officiis ministrabunt quorum unus ad minus erit diaconus.</P>
<P>Omnes vero sacerdotes et clerici simul in camera juxta capellam sita jacebunt, praeter unum quem procurator secum in camera sua habere voluerit, et omnes cum procuratore in aula prandebunt et coenabunt, nisi aliter cogat necessitas.</P>
<P>Decrevit etiam idem Ricardus, ut in tempore hyemali surgant dicti sacerdotes in media nocte ad officium nocturnum perficiendum, quo completo, usque mane dor∣miant, et tunc iterum in silentio ad ecclesiam redeant et officia divina tempori con∣gruentia, signo prius in qualibet hora pulsato, cantando compleant: Aestivo autem tempore ita surgant, ut officium nocturnum compleatur in diluculo, et sic in loco pausent et post modo prescripto ad divina officia redeant.</P>
<P>Idem etiam statuit, ut continue in majori ecclesia in presentia corporis et sanguinis domini sit ignis perpetuus; et quod semper in majori missa in majori ca∣pella celebretur, et in missa beatae Mariae Virginis, accendantur duo luminaria ad minus.</P>
<P>Decrevit etiam idem episcopus, ut secundum statuta Hugonis quondam Dunel∣mensis episcopi predecessoris sui quinque conventus leprosorum, sive sexaginta et quinque, continue ibi vivant, et de bonis dictae domus pascantur et vestiantur; et quod quilibet frater vel soror habeat unum panem in die quinque marcas ponde∣rantem, et unam galonam cerevisiae, ita quod quilibet eorum habeat unam galo∣nam in diem.

Item die quo aliquis sepelietur, potus et cibus detur sepelienti∣bus; similiter eorum scissor die quo scindit pannos suos, habebit cibum et potum: Habebunt etiam quolibet die dominico per annum decem panes albos, scilicet, quinque fratribus et quinque sororibus, qui dispositione prioris et priorissae debent dari magis languentibus. Sciendum etiam quod habebunt in qualibet hebdomada per annum bis vel semel ad minus pisces recentes si inveniri poterint, sed aliquando per defectum piscium dentur allecia rubea, aliquando caseus, aliquando butirum, secundum tempora, et quum dantur allecia, unicuique dentur tria, quum vero butirum vel caseus tunc detur omnibus in commune pondus unius petrae et dimi∣dium.

<P>Illi autem qui debiles sunt in lectis se erigant, et ibi matutinas suas dicant; debiliores in pace jaceant, et quod dicere possunt dicant: Qualibet hora pulsetur signum eorum tam de die quam de nocte, et ante prandium et post, quod pulsabit unus de sanioribus fratribus huic officio deputatus, qui preces eorum dicet; post completorium maneant in silentio, donec in crastino prima pulsetur et dicatur, nisi aliter cogat necessitas, ut infirmitas vel aliquod humanitus.</P>

<P>By these constitutions it appears that the chapel first erected was dedicated to God, Mary Magdalen, and St Nicholas, and was served by three priests and four clerks, part to officiate at the altar of Mary Magdalen; and as the hospital was to receive both sexes, other part to officiate at the altar of St Nicholas, where the women were to hear mass, the chapel being situated at the south door of their house; so that it seems the men and women had houses at separate sides of the area. Bishop Kellaw, for greater decorum, built a new chapel on the north side of the great chapel, which he dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and where he ordered mas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to
<PB N="606" REF="639"/>
be celebrated daily to the brethren, and to this service he appointed a fourth priest. On dominical days and great solemnities, he ordered service to be performed by all the priests to both men and women; the men being preceded by their prior, and the women by their prioress. The procurator or master was not confined to be in clerical orders; but was restrained to that moderation that he should not keep more than three horses without some urgent necessity. The priests and clerks were to lie in the chamber next the chapel, unless the master required one to lodge in his chamber: And the master and all others were to dine and sup in the hall. Bishop Kellaw appointed the times of service, and the burning of lights before the altar. The number of lepers to be entertained being sixty-five, the mess was directed, each to have a loaf and a gallon of beer daily; three days in the week flesh meat, and four days fish, so that one dish of meat, fish, cheese or butter, should serve two: But on great days two dishes were to be provided, par∣ticularly on quadragesima day they were to have fresh salmon or other fish, if they could be had, for one dish; and on Michaelmas-day they should have geese, a goose to every four; but if that festival happened on a weekly fast day, the goose feast was to be postponed to Sunday. They were allowed yearly three yards of woollen cloth, russett or white, six yards of linen, and six yards of canvas, with other ne∣cessaries, as trusses of straw and bundles of reeds, with four yole clogs for the vigils of our Saviour. The brethren were to chuse their prior, and the sisters their prioress. They were allowed fires from Michaelmas-day to the day of All-Saints; the measure of the peats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuel cut from the mosses of moor lands.</NOTE> being fixed. Certain rules were ordained for the sick, for funerals, and prayers. From Pentecost to Michaelmas red herrings and salted viands were prohibited. Two washers were appointed, and an allow∣ance for the nurses who attended the sick; and each member was allowed in money at two days in the year five-pence, and once in the year five shillings.</P>
<P>It is presumed the hospital continued to be regulated and governed by the fore∣going rules till the time of bishop Langley, when great abuses were complained of, the pious institution being converted into private emolument, and the buildings suffered to go to ruin, that prelate issued his commission<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Commission to enquire into dilapidations of Sherburn hospital, by Thomas Langley bishop of Durham, 4th of September, 1429.</NOTE>, dated the 4th of Sep∣tember, 1429, directed to William Chaunceller, his temporal chancellor, and others, to visit and examine the dilapidations in the hospital erections, and to en∣quire of the abuses of the charity. Upon the commissioners reporting the miser∣able condition and poverty thereof, the bishop thought proper to apply to pope Eugene IV. instead of the king, for redress, who readily granted a faculty or com∣mission to the bishop, to make new rules and ordinances for the better government thereof, which he accordingly made on the 22d day of July, 1434, and thereby appointed, that the future master should be in clerical orders, and that he should keep four chaplains, four clerks, or singing men, and two boys, chaunters; and ordained certain rules for the celebration of divine service, and for the conduct of the priests, clerks and boys<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nova ordinatio sive reformatio hospitalis de Shirburn, per Thomam Langley episcopum, ex commis∣sione Eugenii papae quarti, 22 Julii, 1434.</NOTE>. He directed that a tablet should be hung over the
<PB N="607" REF="640"/>
high altar, inscribed with the names of bishop Pudsey, bishop de Marisco, and him∣self, as also with the name of Martin de Sancta Cruce, that mass might be said for them. It thereby appears, that the leprosy (for the relief of those under which affliction this hospital was founded) was at that time almost eradicated, for he directs, that in remembrance of the original foundation, two lepers should be re∣ceived into the hospital, if they could be found, but to be kept apart from the rest of the people admitted to the house: To those, thirteen poor people were to be ad∣ded, to be provided with meat and drink of ten-pence value every week, or ten∣pence of ready money at their own option, and have yearly the sum of 6s. 8d. for fuel and cloaths, and to mess and lodge in the same house, and daily to attend mass. Upon the death of a brother, another poor man to be chosen by the master within fifteen days, under the penalty of paying a mark to the fabric of the church at Durham. An old woman of good character was to be provided at the master's expence, to attend the brethren, wash their linen, and do other offices. The master to have the care of all the goods and buildings of the hospital, and to take an oath for the due performance of all things stipulated by those ordinances.</P>
<P>We hear of no further abuses of the charity till the time of bishop Tunstall, when Anthony Salvin, then master, in 1557, presented a petition to that prelate, praying that a commission of enquiry might issue, with interrogatories <HI>ad perpetuam rei memoriam,</HI> which commission was accordingly issued, and depositions were taken thereon the 27th of April, 1557, and duly returned.</P>

<P>In the thirty-fifth year of queen Elizabeth (1593) a commission of charitable uses was issued, to which articles of enquiry were annexed, and whereon an inquisition was taken the 4th of May, 1594, touching this and other hospitals in the county, with other matters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commission to enquire of charitable uses of all colleges, hospitals, almshouses, rooms, and other places for relief of poor aged and impotent people within the bishopric of Durham, 35th Eliz.

<P>Bishop Matthew, on a visitation held in the year 1595, made ordinances and rules for the better regulation and government of this hospital, among which,</P>
<P>It is ordained, that all and every the brethren appointed by the said statute or foundation, shall willingly and presently (the cause of infirmity by the said maister to be approved only excepted) without delay, repair home, meet and come together at and within the said hospital at two several times in the year yearly, viz. the seventh day of September, being the day of her majesty's birth, and the seventeenth day of November, being the day of her highness's coronation; at which time the maister of the said hospital shall not only allow and perform to all and every the brethren so assembled, sufficient meat and drink for two days space, but also shall make before them some godly christian exhortation, to persuade them to godliness and obedience, and a continual thankfulness for the great benefits of her majesty bestowed on them and that hospital.</P>
<P>The maister henceforth shall not admit nor receive any married man having his wife alive, usually to lodge and continue within the precinct of the said hospital, and shall not permit their wives or children, or other friends and acquaintance to resort into the said hospital; and that the said maister shall not permit any of the said brethren to gadd or range abroad, without especial cause allowed and licence ob∣tained, either by the maister or his curate.</P>
<P>If any of the said brethren either resident or absent, shall become a stubborn or disobedient person, a disturber of the common peace in that society, a despiser of the present state, a maintainer of factions, a drawer from obedience, a seducer from
<PB N="610" REF="643"/>
religion, a whisperer or spreader of lies, or a common frequenter of infamous or defamed persons or places; every such person convented or convicted thereof be∣fore the maister there under the testimony of four or five of the brethren then pre∣sent, shall, according to the quality of his offence be punished or expelled, accord∣ing to the order of the said foundation.</P>
<P>And if any of the brethren there resident, either in weakness of stomach, de∣sire, or by wilful contempt, refuse and dislike the prescript-diet of the house, then the maister of the same hospital shall suffer or compel the same party to his own private provision elsewhere; giving and allowing yearly unto the said party or parties each one forty shillings, to be paid by ten shillings a quarter, as others absent formerly have been wont to receive; provided always, that no brother shall make sale of his place on pain of present expulsion.</P>
<P>Lastly; it is ordained by the said reverend father, that all the stock of goods and chattels, corn, hay, utensils, and implements of the said hospital whatsoever, shall be delivered by the former maister if he be living, or by his executors or assigns if he be dead, unto the successor and brethren by an inventory tripartite, as was done lately after the death of maister Dr Daile, whereof one part to remain with the bishop of Duresme, and another part with the successor, and the third part with the former maister and his executors; and to this purpose every new maister before his admission shall become bound to the lord bishop of Duresme for the time being in a bond of eight hundred pounds or more, for the performance, safety, and delivery of all the said stock of goods and chattels, corn, hay, utensils, and imple∣ments whatsoever belonging to the said hospital, at every change of the maister, ac∣cording to the aforesaid inventory, and the commendable examples of his prede∣cessors the former maisters of the said hospital.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>ORDINANCES AND RULES,</HI> For the good order and government of <HI>Sherborn Hospital,</HI> in the County of Durham.</HEAD>
<P>Ordinances and rules for the good order and government of the master and brethren of Christ's hospital at Sherborne, near Durham, and their possessions, delivered to them the twenty-sixth day of August, by Edward, by divine providence lord bishop of Durham, at his primary visitation of the said hos∣pital, which was begun August the 14th, 1735, and continued by several ad∣journments to that day.</P>
<P>EDWARD, by divine providence lord bishop of Duresme. To our well be∣loved in Christ, Wadham Chandler, clerk, master of arts, master of the said hos∣pital, Richard Grey, John Whitfield, and the rest of the brethren.</P>
<P>If the changes incident to all persons and things did not insensibly introduce deviations from the original constitutions of societies also, and make frequent re∣views of the laws whereby they should be governed necessary, for preserving a consistency between men's practices and their rules, yet the present condition of Christ's Hospital at Sherburn in particular, would demand a speedy provision to be made against some evils the house labours under, and which by longer neglect may grow to be very detrimental to it.</P>
<P>For having in our visitation upon the place discovered that all the local statutes made by our predecessors, since the foundation of the said hospital by queen Eliza∣beth, with consent of her parliament, were either lost, concealed, or of no validity, for want of a ratification under the episcopal seal, as is required by her act; that their stocks of cattle and corn were destroyed and consumed in the time of the civil wars, by the two armies in the neighbourhood of Sherburn house; that no inven∣tory hath been since taken of their goods, nor bond given by the entering master, for any sum of money to be paid to every succeeding master, as a fund in readi∣ness for the occasions of the said hospital, and as was wont formerly to be given, we judged no time was to be lost in settling new rules, without which no society can well subsist, which may also be effectual for securing what goods and chattles
<PB N="612" REF="645"/>
are still remaining, and prevent further ruin to their common estate, which in a long chancery suit at this distance of time, after a succession of two or three masters, under a defect of full proofs, must be hazarded with small prospect of success.</P>
<P>In drawing up these rules, we have revived as many ordinances of the first founders as could be adapted to the present state of things, and followed those of our late predecessors where we could presume of their intentions by their articles of visitation which we have seen, and these rules so collected and hereafter follow∣ing, we, by the authority given us by act of parliament, as well as the antienter constitutions of the first founders, bishops of this diocese, do for ourselves and suc∣cessors, order and appoint to be the standing rules to be observed by all the mem∣bers of the said hospital, until such time as any of our successors shall see cause, or in their wisdom think proper to alter or amend them.</P>
<P>And to prevent confusion by a disagreement of these with any former rules, (should any such come to light hereafter) we, after the example of our worthy predecessor Thomas Langley in his new ordination of the said hospital, rescind and annul all former constitutions, rules, and ordinances, made by any of our prede∣cessors, and do substitute these in their place, as the only rules they shall be bound to obey. Given at our castle at Durham, the twenty-sixth day of August, being one of the days and places to which we adjourned our visitation of the said hospital, in the eighteenth year of our consecration, fifth of our translation, and in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and thirty-five.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Concerning the MASTER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The master shall be always a person in holy orders, of the degree of master of arts at least, a licensed preacher, and one who is capable of business and applies himself to it, especially for the maintenance and prosperous estate of the hospital.</P>
<P N="2">2. The master or his deputy appointed by him to act in his name, shall usually reside within the said hospital, for the better ordering and governing the members thereof, according to an ancient constitution of Tho. Langley bishop of Duresme; saving to the said bishop his ordinary jurisdiction over them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The master if he be not constantly resident in person, shall often repair thither to preach and read lectures on catechetical heads to them, and to enquire and hear the complaints of the brethren when they have any, and see them redressed.</P>
<P N="4">4. The common seal shall be kept by the master only, in a box locked up, and not to be trusted with the deputy, and the master shall be always present when the seal is put to any instrument.</P>
<P N="5">5. The counterparts of the leases shall be preserved in the custody of the master himself, and as often as there shall be occasion to trust any writing out of his hands, he shall take a note for the safe delivery of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. No demise of lands anciently used to be demised, shall pass otherwise than by the common seal; and no demise of lands not demiseable by queen Elizabeth's foundation, shall be accounted valid in law, though it be duly sealed with the com∣mon seal.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="613" REF="646"/>7. Upon sealing of any lease, twelve-pence and no more shall be given to every member that attends to sign the lease.</P>
<P N="8">8. The demesnes at Sherburn shall never be demised by lease for years or lives, but the whole or at least the greatest part thereof shall continue in the occupation of the master or his deputy, steward or agent, so that there shall always be main∣tained on the ground a full stock of young cattle of all kinds, and a sufficient quan∣tity of hay and stores of corn and other grain in the granaries, to answer all oc∣casions of the house.</P>
<P N="9">9. Upon the death, cession, or resignation of every master, so much of his stock and stores of all sorts, as shall be prized to the value of two hundred pounds, shall be delivered over to the succeeding master, who shall be legally intitled thereto from the preceding master, his heirs, or executors, or the sum of two hundred pounds for and in lieu and in full satisfaction for the same.</P>
<P N="10">10. For the better securing of this two hundred pounds, or stock or stores to the value thereof, every master soon after his induction, shall be bound to the bishop of Duresme in the penalty of four hundred pounds, for the payment of two hundred pounds, or stock and stores of that value to his lawful successor, which bond shall be lodged in the registry of the bishop's consistory court, to be delivered up and cancelled upon performance of the condition by the preceding master.</P>
<P N="11">11. An exact inventory shall be taken by every master at his coming into his place of all the plate, houshold goods, kitchen and brewing vessels, utensils in the dairy, cellar, and for husbandry, linen, bedding, and all other furniture, as well belonging to the house of the master, as the houses of the brethren, and three copies made thereof and signed by the said master, the one to be lodged in the re∣gistry aforesaid, with the bond for two hundred pounds, the other to be preserved by the master himself, and the third to be kept by the heirs or executors of the preceding master, who is obliged to leave the same as he received them at his en∣trance, according to the said inventory.</P>
<P N="12">12. The original of these statutes to be safely locked up in the same box with the common seal, to be delivered with the said seal to the next lawful successor by the predecessor or his executors or administrators, and a book shall be prepared for common use, wherein these statutes and ordinances, as far as they concern the brethren, shall be fairly written, with queen Elizabeth's act of foundation in the 27th year of her reign, and such other rules as shall hereafter be made by any suc∣ceeding bishop.—These rules concerning the brethren are to be read to the inn-brethren at a full meeting once a year.</P>
<P N="13">13. A quarto book shall be carefully kept by the master or his deputy, wherein shall be fairly entered the names of all the present members, and the time of their coming in, and when and before whom they were sworn; and as often as any of them die, the brother who succeeds him shall have his name entered, his country, parish, his age, and the day of the year of his being sworn, and by whom, and whom he succeeds, and till this be done, no person shall be reckoned a brother or member of Sherburn-house.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="614" REF="647"/>14. As many brethren shall be lodged within the house, as the ancient lodgings will permit, and have usually for many years past resided therein.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of the BRETHREN.</HEAD>
<P N="15">15. In filling up the vacant places of the inn-brethren, a preference shall be of∣ten given to the out-brethren, who in the master's opinion deserve to be taken into the house, yet so as that it shall be a matter of choice and discretion in the master, and not of obliga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion to proceed in that way.</P>
<P N="16">16. These qualifications shall be required in every man that is admitted into Sherburn house as a brother; that he be a single person who hath lived well and creditably in the world, and is not at this time worth twenty pounds; that he be born in the county of Durham, unless by special allowance of the bishop, the coun∣ty be dispensed with; and particularly that such as have lived within the manors, and been tenants to the lands of the bishopric or hospital estate, if in other respects they be as well qualified, shall have the preference; that he be of the age of fifty-six or upwards, never under; that he be not then labouring under any sickness, or incurable or infectious disease, though the lame and impotent should be con∣sidered in the first place.</P>
<P N="17">17. He shall be a constant member of the church of England by law established, and continue so.</P>
<P N="18">18. To this end we order, that every man that desires to be a brother, shall present a petition to the master, setting forth his case, with a certificate of his age, under the hand of the minister of the parish where he was born, and another cer∣tificate of his peaceable social disposition, and sober behaviour, and conformity to the church of England for some years last past, under the hands of credible gen∣tlemen and others, neighbours to the place where he hath last lived; which peti∣tions and certificates shall be filed by the master, to be produced when he shall be called upon.</P>
<P N="19">19. No one shall be treated as a brother and member of this corporation, or en∣titled to any profits as such, who hath not first taken his corporal oath for per∣forming such ordinances and rules as have been, and shall hereafter be made and set down by the bishop of Duresme, under his hand and seal in writing, for the good order and government of the master and brethren of the said hospital, which said oath shall be taken before the bishop, if he happens to be at that time in the city of Durham, or else before his spiritual chancellor, or the chancellor's principal surrogate, without fee.</P>
<P N="20">20. Within a month after every vacancy, the master, if he be in the country, shall be bound to put in a new brother, or within six weeks at most, if the master be far absent; and upon the master's neglecting to fill up the place within that time, it shall be in the power of the bishop to name a brother without the master, who shall be accordingly admitted.</P>
<P N="21">21. No woman, child, male relation or friend, shall be suffered to abide with him in the room or lodging of any brother, on any account, except a nurse to take care of the sick.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="615" REF="648"/>22. No brother shall presume to be absent from prayers, to go abroad, much less to lie out of the house, without leave of the master or his deputy, which shall be sparingly allowed, and the time of absence not above two or three days, and the leave to be noted in a book kept for that purpose.</P>
<P N="23">23. The brethren shall attend duly morning and evening prayer, sermons on the Lord's day, and the holy sacrament of the Lord's supper, as often as it shall be ad∣ministered, and they shall be there early at the beginning of the respective offices, and continue there to the end: And the better to know who performs this duty, the clerk of the chappel shall keep a weekly roll, with the names of the brethren, and prick at the name of every one present, and on Monday morning deliver this roll to the master or his deputy, in order to their receiving admonition or correction according to the heinousness of their offence.</P>
<P N="24">24. The chaplain of the said hospital shall be constant in reading the morning and evening service, according to the liturgy of the church of England, and preach every Lord's day, and mostly upon catechetical heads, and administer the holy sa∣crament four times in the year at least, of which the solemn festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, shall be three of the times; he shall be diligent in visit∣ing the sick, and exhorting the well, as often as he knows of their doing amiss.</P>
<P N="25">25. For the employment of their thoughts on the week days, a Bible and Whole Duty of Man shall be provided for every inn-brother, which upon the death of any of them, shall go with all the furniture of his chamber (bought by the master) to his successor; and they shall be often put in mind of daily prayers in secret in their own rooms.</P>
<P N="26">26. No brother shall be allowed to be a drunkard, a fornicator or unchaste, a caballer or mischief-maker, profane, a despiser of God, religion or divine worship, injurious or unsociable to his fellows, disrespectful, saucy, or disobdient to the master, or in a word, be guilty of any notorious crime, or live a disorderly offensive life.</P>
<P N="27">27. In all these cases the master to whom the power and authority of govern∣ing the brethren and servants of the house is committed, shall by himself or his deputy, or the chaplain, correct and punish the offender, according to the quality and degree of the offence, (that is to say) at first, by a serious admonition and warning, and then by suspending him from his diet for two, three, or more days, according to the master's pleasure: Provided that the suspension be never longer than three weeks at a time, and the value of the diet of the suspended person be divided among such of the brethren as are not offenders; and if after the ex∣ercise of such discipline, any brother shall go on to offend in the same way, the master shall then carry his complaint of him to the bishop, that he may be re∣moved, or otherwise punished as the bishop shall think fit.</P>
<P N="28">28. We ordain, that the said brethren who are well and sound, do eat together at dinner in their common hall or room, according to a constitution of Thomas Langley to that effect, unless for reasons to be given to the bishop, he shall dis∣pense with this rule for any time. One of the brethren shall be chosen by them∣selves
<PB N="616" REF="649"/>
to say grace before and after meat, or give God thanks for the bountiful provision he hath made for them, and for raising up such benefactors to them.</P>
<P N="29">29. The woman that is to wash their cloaths, &amp;c. shall be of middle age, of good fame and conversation, as the same also is required of all the other servants and ministers belonging to the house.</P>
<P N="30">30. We do revive and enforce the late orders concerning the manner of diet of the brethren throughout the year, with some few alterations, as annexed in a separate paper, which we order to be transcribed and hung up in the hall where the brethren eat.</P>
<P N="31">31. Lastly, as to the relief of poor travellers at the gate, which hath been custo∣mary, and no doubt piously intended, we give no injunctions; idle vagrants should be discouraged and punished, necessitous travellers on their honest occasions sup∣plied, but care should be taken that such as have no legal settlement be not made burthensome to the hospital, by an indiscreet relief, as is directed by an act of par∣liament for ascertaining of settlements.</P>
