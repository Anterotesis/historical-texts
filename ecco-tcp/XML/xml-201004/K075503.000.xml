<P>CHRONOLOGY: OR, A CONCISE VIEW OF THE Annals of England.</P>
<P>WHEREIN Every particular Occurrence, from the De∣scent of Julius Caesar, to the present Time, met with in different Historians, is accu∣rately and alphabetically recorded, with the Date affixed:</P>
<P>Also, an exact Chronology of the Lives of the most eminent Men, in all Ages of the World.</P>
<P>To which is added, A PLAN of the SAXON HEPTARCHY; By which means, the various Successions of different Kings may be seen at one View, and the Time of each particular Event immediately found, without the Trouble of recurring to the voluminous Pages of History.</P>
<P>Useful to all who are desirous of being ac∣quainted with their own Country.</P>

<HEAD>A CHRONOLOGICAL REMARK, Necessary to be observed by all Readers of HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>GREEK Authors always date from the Creation of the World. They reckon, to the first Year of the Christian Aera, 5503; so that, when we meet in them the Dates of any Events since the Birth of our Saviour, we need only subtract 5508, to have, in the Remainder, the Year of the common Aera. Thus, according to the Greek Historians, the first Council of Nice was held in the Year 5833; subtract 5508, and there remains 325, the Year of Christ in which that Council was assembled.</P>
<P>In like manner, when Events are dated by the Years of Rome, we need only sub∣tract 753, to have, in the Remainder, the common Years. For example, Tiberius died in the Year of Rome 790; from 790, take 753, and the Remainder, 37, is the Year of Christ in which that Prince's Death happened.</P>

<HEAD>WILLIAM II.'s REIGN.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1090. A Dreadful earthquake throughout the whole kingdom, which was follow∣ed by a great scarcity of fruit, and so late a harvest, that corn was not full ripe at the end of November. <HI>Sir J. Haywood's History, Will.</HI> II.</ITEM>
<ITEM><P>1091. On the 5th of October, there fell a violent storm in several parts of England, especially at Winchelscomb, in Glocestershire, where the steeple of the church was thrown down by thunder and lightening, and the crucifix, with the image of the Virgin, was broken to pieces. The hurricane was followed by a noisome stink. <HI>Holingshed.</HI></P>
<P>During the above, there was also a thick smoke which darkened the sky. <HI>Sir J. Hayw.</HI></P>
<P>On the 17th of the same month, there hap∣pened a storm of wind at S. W. the same that blew in the late tempest, so dreadful to the whole nation. In London, it threw down above 500 houses, and unroofed Bow-church. At Old Sarum, the steeple and many houses were blown down. <HI>Holing.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>1094, was remarkable for the number of gliding stars, that seemed to dash together, in manner of a conflict. <HI>Sir J. Hayw.</HI></P>
<P>Also for a great mortality of men and beasts, so that the ground lay untilled in many places, which caused a severe dearth. <HI>Holing.</HI></P></ITEM>

<ITEM><P>1111. The river Trent, near Nottingham, ceased to run its course for twenty-four hours, so that the channel was dried up. <HI>Holing.</HI></P>
<P>There was, this year, a great mortality among men, cattle, and fowls. <HI>Sir J. Hayw.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>1113. The water of the river Medway failed so much, that the smallest boats could not float in the channel; also, the Thames was so low between the Tower and the bridge, that wo∣men and children waded it over; owing to so great an ebb in the ocean, that laid the sands bare several miles from the shore, which con∣tinued a whole day. <HI>Sir J. Hayw.</HI></P>
<P>In December, the air appeared red, as though it burned, <HI>Holing.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM>1114. During this year, almost all the bridges in England, being then of timber, were broken down by the ice when it thawed, after a severe frost. <HI>Holing.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>1120. In September, an earthquake.</ITEM>
<ITEM><P>1134. On the 2d of August, just as King Henry was about to take ship, and sail for Normandy, an eclipse of the sun and moon appeared; at which time, William of Malmsbury, who was then living, writes, he saw the stars plainly about the sun. This eclipse was followed by a most terrible earthquake.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47"/>During the earthquake, flames of fire burst out of certain riffs of the earth with great violence. <HI>Holing.</HI></P></ITEM>

<ITEM>1160. Thirty German heretics came to England, to propagate their opinions. They said they were Christians, but denied baptism, the Lord's supper, and matrimony; for which they were condemned by a council of bishops at Oxford, and delivered over to the secular arm. Accordingly, they were marked in the fore∣head with a red hot iron, whipped, and thrust out of doors naked, in the midst of winter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where, none daring to relieve them, an order having been published to the contrary, they died of hunger and cold.</ITEM>
<ITEM><P>1171. A great tempest happened in Scotland, Eng∣land, and Ireland. <HI>Holing.</HI></P>
<P>As King Henry was about to take horse at Cardiff, in Glamorganshire, an apparition ap∣peared to him, and, having threatened him with some dreadful plagues, if he did not amend his life, it vanished. <HI>Holing.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM>1172. The following infamous collect was ordered to be used in all churches in the province of Canterbury, to expiate the guilt of Becket's murder:
<Q>Be favourable, good Lord, to our supplication and prayer, that we, which ac∣knowledge ourselves guilty of iniquity, may be delivered by the intercession of Thomas, thy blessed martyr and bishop.</Q> <HI>Holing.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>1179. On the 18th of June, after sun-set, the new moon then shining out fair, with her horns to the east, on a sudden, seemed to be divided in two, out of which there appeared to rise a burning brand, casting forth sparks and flames, as if it had been on fire. The body of the moon seemed to wriggle like an adder that is beaten; it did so above twelve times, and then turned black. <HI>Holing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="48"/>At Christmas, at a place called Oxen-hall, near Darlington, in the bishoprick of Durham, the earth raised itself up like a lofty tower, and remained several hours in that posture; on a sudden, it funk down again, with a horrid noise, and the earth so sucked it in, that it made there a deep pit, which continues to this day. Mr. Camden supposes it to be the wells that are now called Hell-kettles. <HI>Rog. Hov.</HI></P></ITEM>

<ITEM>1189. The fish leaped out of a pool in Normandy, and fought together on dry land, with such noise, as drew the neighbouring people to behold this wonder, which was in the night∣time.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1190. On Midsummer-eve, the sun was eclipsed for three hours, at ten in the morning, and the stars appeared.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1193. 1194. 1195. There was so great a dearth in England and France, that a quarter of wheat was sold for almost twenty shillings, as much as six pounds now, which was followed by a pestilential fever, that carried off multitudes of people; during which time, the dead were buried in a great many at once, people died so fast. About Whitsunday, two suns appeared, so like each other, that they could not be distinguished without instruments. <HI>Com. Hist. Eng. p.</HI> 156.</ITEM>

<ITEM>1221. Two impostors were crucified, for giving out, that they were both of them the Mes∣siah, or Christ; and two women were ex∣ecuted, the one for pretending the Virgin Ma∣ry, and the other, Mary Magdalen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1222. There was a dreadful tempest of thunder, lightening, and rain, in February, which
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>threw down several churches. This was followed by extraordinary rains, and that by a dearth, another violent tempest, an earth∣quake, a prodigious storm of wind, inunda∣tions, and a comet. <HI>Holing.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>1233. It thundered for fifteen days together. The next year began with terrible tempests of thun∣der, rain, and floods, which spoiled the fruits of the earth.</P>
<P>In April, at seven in the morning, there ap∣peared four false suns, in Worcestershire and Herefordshire. The true sun was of a red co∣lour, with a great circle, of chrystaline colour, whose circuit seemed as large as the kingdom of England; from its sides went forth certain half circles, in whose sections the four false suns appeared. <HI>Holing.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM>1239. On the 16th of June, Prince Edward, Hen∣ry III.'s eldest son was born. Before his birth there appeared a new star in the heavens for se∣veral days together; it was carried with a swift course through a long circuit of air; it seemed sometimes to bear fire along with it, and some∣times to leave smoak behind it. <HI>Holing.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>1240. There was a great battle of fish at sea, so that eleven whales were cast ashore, and ap∣peared to be dead, from some wounds they had received. Not long after, a great sound was heard at one time, in all parts of England, as if it had been the noise of mountains falling in∣to the sea. <HI>Mat. Paris.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>1242. The sun was eclipsed in a terrible manner, and, two years afterwards, so many stars seem∣ed to fall from heaven, that, had they really fallen, none would have been left. <HI>Holing.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>1248. On the 14th of February, there happened a dreadful earthquake, and the sea, for a long tract, near the coast of England, ceased to ebb and flow for near three months together. <HI>Ho∣ling.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>1249. Several steeples and houses were thrown
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>down in Somersetshire by an earthquake. <HI>Holing.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>1250. On the 1st of October, the moon appeared red and bloated, the presage of a storm of wind, so violent, that the sea flowed twice without ebbing, and, in the night, seemed to burn. Soon after, an earthquake was felt at St. Al∣ban's. <HI>Holing.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>1251. The chimney of the chamber where the Queen and her children lay, was blown down by a terrible storm, and her whole apartment at Windsor shaken and torn. Oaks in the park were rent asunder, and turned up by the roots, and all was accompanied with such thunders and lightnings as had not been known in the memory of man. <HI>Holing.</HI></P>
<P>In May, the new moon appeared three days before her time, and the sun, moon, and stars, for fifteen days successively, seemed of a red colour. A dearth, and a murrain among cattle followed this prodigy. <HI>Holing.</HI></P></ITEM>

<ITEM>1330. July 16, there happened a great eclipse of the sun, and the rains were so violent this year, that the harvest did not begin till Mi∣chaelmas.
