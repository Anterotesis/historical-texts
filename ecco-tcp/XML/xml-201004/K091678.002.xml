<P>WEIGHT four pounds and an half. Head small,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCRIPTION.</NOTE> covered with a naked wrinkled red skin, beset with black bristles. This gives it some resemblance to a Turkey; from which it derives one of the names. The nostrils are very large, and pervious: the whole plumage is dusky, dashed with purple and green: legs of a dirty flesh-color: claws black.</P>
<P>These birds are common from <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> to <HI>Terra del Fuego;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> but swarm in the hotter parts of <HI>America;</HI> and are found in the islands, where they are said to be far inferior in size to those of <HI>North Ame∣rica.</HI></P>
<P>In the warm climates they keep in vast flocks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> Perch at night on rocks or trees; sitting with dishevelled wings to purify their bodies,
<PB N="192" REF="7"/>
which are most offensively fetid. Towards morning they take flight, soaring at a vast height, with the gentle motion of a kite; expecting notice of their banquet by the tainted effluvia of carrion, excrements, or any filth. They have most sagacious nostrils, and smell their prey at a vast distance; to which they resort from all quarters, wheeling about, and making a gradual descent till they reach the ground. They do not confine themselves to dead animals, but feed on Snakes, and sometimes on Lambs. They are very tame, and, while they are at their meals, will suffer a very near approach.</P>
<P>In the torrid zone, particularly about <HI>Carthagena,</HI> they haunt in∣habited places, and are seen in numbers sitting on the roofs of the houses, or walking along the streets with a sluggish pace. In those parts they are useful, as the IBIS in <HI>Egypt,</HI> devouring the noisome subjects, which would otherwise, by the intolerable stench, render the climate still more unwholesome than it is.</P>
<P>When these birds find no food in the cities, they are driven by hunger among the cattle of the neighboring pastures. If they see a beast with a sore on the back, they instantly alight on it, and at∣tack the part affected. The poor animal attempts in vain to free itself from the devourers, rolling on the ground with hideous cries: but in vain; for the Vultures never quit hold, till they have effected its destruction. Sometimes an Eagle presides at the banquet, and keeps these cowardly birds at a distance, until it has finished its re∣past.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE>Mischievous as they are in a few instances, yet, by the wise and beneficent dispensations of Providence, they make in the hot climates full recompence, by lessening the number of those destructive ani∣mals the Alligators, which would otherwise become intolerable by their multitudes. During the season in which these reptiles lay their eggs in the sand, the Vultures will sit hid in the leaves of the trees, watching the coming of the female Alligator to deposit its eggs, who then covers them with sand, to secure them, as she ima∣gines, from all danger: but no sooner does she retire into the water,
<PB N="193" REF="8"/>
than the birds dart on the spot, and with claws, wings, and beak, tear away the sand, and devour the whole contents of the depository.</P>
<P>No birds of this genus are found in northern regions of <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>Asia,</HI> at lest in those latitudes which might give them a pretence of appearing here. I cannot find them in our quarter of the globe higher than the <HI>Grison Alps</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wil.

It is rather inferior in size to the former; but is a generous, spirited, and docile bird. The independent <HI>Tartars</HI> train it for the chace of Hares, Foxes, Ante∣lopes, and even Wolves. The use is of considerable antiquity; for <HI>Marco Polo,</HI> the great traveller of 1269, observed and admired the diversion of the great <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary;</HI> who had several Eagles, which were applied to the same purposes as they are at present<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">M.

<P>BILL, cere, and feet, pale yellow: head, neck, and tail, of a pure white: body and wings of a chocolate-color. It does not ac∣quire its white head till the second year.</P>
<P>This Eagle is lesser than the foregoing species, but of great spirit: preys on Fawns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> Pigs, Lambs, and fish: is the terror of the Osprey, whose motions it watches. The moment the latter has seized a fish, the former pursues till the Osprey drops its prey; which, with amazing dexterity, it catches before it falls to the ground, be the distance ever so great. This is matter of great amusement to the inhabitants of <HI>North America,</HI> who often watch their aerial contests. This species frequently attends the sportsman, and snatches up the game he has shot, before he can reach it.</P>
<P>These birds build in vast decayed cypresses<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Catesby.</NOTE>, or pines, impending over the sea, or some great river, in company with Ospreys, Herons, and other birds: and their nests are so numerous, as to resemble a rookery. The nests are very large, and very fetid by reason of

the reliques of their prey. <HI>Lawson</HI> says, they breed very often, lay∣ing again under their callow young; whose warmth hatches the eggs. In <HI>Bering</HI>'s isle they make their nests on the cliffs, near six feet wide, and one thick; and lay two eggs in the beginning of <HI>July.</HI></P>

<HEAD>90. WHITE EAGLE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS most beautiful and scarce species is entirely white, except the tips of the wings, which are black. We know nothing of this bird, but what is collected from <HI>Du Pratz</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 75.</HI> Latham, <HI>i. 36.</HI></NOTE>. The natives of <HI>Louisiana</HI> set a high value on the feathers, and give a large price for those of the wings; with them they adorn the Calumet, or pipe of peace. Different nations make use of the wings, or feathers of different birds; but, according to <HI>Hennepin,</HI> always decorate it with the most beautiful.</P>
<P>The Calumet is an instrument of the first importance among the <HI>Americans.</HI> It is nothing more than a pipe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALUMET.</NOTE> whose bowl is generally made of a soft red marble<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>i. 298.</HI> Kalm, <HI>iii. 230.</HI></NOTE>: the tube of a very long reed, orna∣mented with the wings and feathers of birds. No affair of conse∣quence is transacted without the Calumet. It ever appears in meet∣ings of commerce, or exchanges; in congresses for determining of peace or war; and even in the very fury of a battle. The accept∣ance of the Calumet is a mark of concurrence with the terms pro∣posed; as the refusal is a certain mark of rejection. Even in the rage of a conflict this pipe is sometimes offered; and if accepted, the weapons of destruction instantly drop from their hands, and a truce ensues. It seems the sacrament of the Savages; for no compact is ever violated, which is confirmed by a whiff from this holy reed. The <HI>Dance of the Calumet</HI> is a solemn rite which always confirms a peace, or precedes a war. It is divided into three parts: the first, appears an act of devotion, danced in measured time: the second, is a true representation of the Pyrrhic dance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. x. p. 736. edit. <HI>Amstel.</HI> 1707.</NOTE>: the third, is attended with songs expressive of the victories they had obtained, the nations they had conquered, and the captives they had made.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="13"/>From the winged ornaments of the <HI>Calumet,</HI> and its conciliat∣ing uses, writers compare it to the <HI>Caduceus</HI> of <HI>Mercury,</HI> which was carried by the <HI>Caduceatores,</HI> or messengers of peace, with terms to the hostile states. It is singular, that the most remote nations, and the most opposite in their other customs and manners, should in some things have, as it were, a certain consent of thought. The <HI>Greeks</HI> and the <HI>Americans</HI> had the same idea, in the invention of the <HI>Caduceus</HI> of the one, and the <HI>Calumet</HI> of the other. Some authors imagine, that among the <HI>Greeks</HI> the wings were meant as a symbol of elo∣quence. I rather think that the twisted Serpents expressed that in∣sinuating faculty; and that the emblem was originally taken from the fatal effect the rhetoric of <HI>Satan</HI> had on our great mother, when he assumed the form of that reptile, which the highest authority repre∣sents as <HI>more subtile than any beast of the field.</HI> On this the heathen mythology formed their tale of <HI>Jupiter</HI> taking the figure of a Serpent, to insinuate himself into the good graces of <HI>Olympias;</HI> who, like <HI>Eve,</HI> fell a victim to his persuasive tongue. As to the wings, it is most probable that they were to shew the flight of discord; which the re∣conciled parties gave, with all the horrors of war, to the air, and sport of the winds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oole,</HI> or Eagle, is a sacred bird among the <HI>Americans.</HI> In case of sickness, they invoke this bird to descend from heaven (which in its exalted flight it approaches nearer than any other) and bring down refreshing things; as it can dart down on its rapid wing quick as a flash of lightning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adair's Hist.

The Eagle hears the note, and instantly attacks the Osprey; who drops the fish, which the former catches before it can reach the ground, or water. It sometimes happens that the Osprey perishes in taking its prey; for if it chances to fix its talons in an over-grown fish, it is drawn under water before it can disengage itself, and is drowned.</P>

<P>These birds prey on young Seals, which they seize as they are floating on the water; but oft-times, by fixing their talons in an old one, they are overmatched, and drawn down to the bottom, screaming hor∣ribly.

<P>The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> use their skins for cloathing, next to their bodies. They eat the flesh, and keep the bill and feet for amulets.

<P><PB N="217" REF="34"/>This species is an inhabitant of <HI>Iceland,</HI> is the most esteemed of any for the sport of falconry, and is, with the two following, reserved for the kings of <HI>Denmark;</HI> who sends his falconer, with two attendants, annually into the island to purchase them. They are caught by the natives; a certain number of whom in every district are licensed for that purpose. They bring all they take, about <HI>Midsummer,</HI> to <HI>Bes∣fested,</HI> to meet the royal falconer; and each brings ten or twelve, capped, and perched on a cross pole, which they carry on horseback, and rest on the stirrup. The falconer examines the birds, rejects those which are not for his purpose, and gives the seller a written certificate of the qualities of each, which entitles him to receive from the king's receiver-general seventeen rixdollars for F, or the purest white Falcon; ten for E, or those which are lest white; and seven for this species<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brunnick, <HI>p. 2.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>They are taken in the following manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNER OF TAKING.</NOTE>—Two posts are fastened in the ground, not remote from their haunts. To one is tied a Ptar∣migan, a Pigeon, a Cock or Hen, fastened to a cord that it may have means of fluttering, and so attract the attention of the Falcon. On the other post is placed a net, distended on a hoop, about six feet in diameter. Through this post is introduced a string, above a hundred yards long, which is fastened to the net, in order to pull it down; and another is fastened to the upper part of the hoop, and goes through the post to which the bait is tied. As soon as the Falcon sees the fowl flutter on the ground, he takes a few circles in the air, to see if there is any danger, then darts on its prey with such vio∣lence as to strike off the head, as nicely as if it was done with a razor. He then usually rises again, and takes another circle, to ex∣plore the place a second time: after which it makes another stoop; when, at the instant of its descending, the man pulls the dead bird under the net; and, by means of the other cord, covers the Falcon with the net, at the moment it has seized the prey; the person lying
<PB N="218" REF="35"/>
concealed behind some stones, or else lies flat on his belly, to elude the sight of the Falcon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horrebow, <HI>59, 60.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As soon as one is caught, it is taken gently out of the net, for fear of breaking any of the feathers of the wings or tail; and a cap is placed over its eyes. If any of the tail-feathers are injured, the fal∣coners have the art of grafting others<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brunnick, <HI>p. 3.</HI> Horrebow, <HI>58.</HI></NOTE>; which sometimes has oc∣casioned a needless multiplication of species.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iceland</HI> Falcons are in the highest esteem. They will last ten or twelve years; whereas those of <HI>Norway,</HI> and other countries, sel∣dom are fit for sport after two or three years use. Yet the <HI>Nor∣wegian</HI> Hawks were in old times in great repute in this kingdom, and even thought bribes worthy of a king. <HI>Geoffry Le Pierre,</HI> chief justiciary, gave two good <HI>Norway</HI> Hawks to King <HI>John,</HI> that <HI>Walter Le Madina</HI> might have leave to export a hundred weight of cheese. <HI>John,</HI> the son of <HI>Ordgar,</HI> gave a <HI>Norway</HI> Hawk to have the king's request to the king of <HI>Norway,</HI> to let him have his brother's chattels; and <HI>Ralf Havoc</HI> fined to King <HI>Stephen</HI> in two Girfals (Gyrfalcons) and two <HI>Norway</HI> Hawks, that he might have the same acquittance that his father had<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Madox, Antiq. Exch. <HI>469. 497.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIQUITY OF FALCONRY.</NOTE>I cannot fix the precise time of the origin of falconry; the pas∣sage in <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and the epigram in <HI>Martial,</HI> do by no means fix it to the periods in which they wrote. The philosopher <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Arist. de Mirabil. Auscult.</NOTE> informs us, that <Q>there was a district in <HI>Thrace,</HI> in which the boys used to assemble at a certain time of the year, for the sake of bird-catch∣ing. That the spot was much frequented by Hawks, which were wont to appear on hearing themselves called: and would drive the little birds into the bushes, where they were caught by the children; and that the Hawks would even sometimes take the birds and fling them to these young sportsmen; who (after finishing their diversion) gratefully bestowed on their assistants part of their prey.</Q> This tale may have some truth at the bottom;
<PB N="219" REF="36"/>
it being notorious that Larks, and even Partridges, will, by the ter∣ror of a Hawk passing over them, lie so still as to suffer themselves to be taken by any passenger. Here seems to have been no training of these <HI>Thracian</HI> Hawks, but a mere casual concurrence of Hawks and small birds, which afforded now and then an amusement to the youth of the country. The thought expressed on the antient gem, of little <HI>Genii</HI> engaged in the chace of Deer, assisted by an Eagle, may have originated from this story.</P>
<P>The Poet only describes another kind of bird-catching, in the following epigram on the fate of a Hawk:
<Q><L>Praedo fuit volucrum, famulus nunc Aucupis, idem</L>
<L>Decipit, et captas non sibi, moeret, aves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. xiv. ep. 216.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
By the word <HI>decipit,</HI> it is plain that the Hawk was not trained; but was merely used as a stale, either to entice small birds under a net, or to the limed twigs: the last is a method still in use in <HI>Italy.</HI> The <HI>Italians</HI> call it <HI>Uccellare con la Civetta;</HI> for instead of a Hawk, they place a small species of Owl on a pole, in the middle of a field; and surround it, at various distances, with lime-twigs. The small birds, from their strange propensity to approach rapacious fowls, fly around, perch on the rods, and are taken in great numbers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Olina, <HI>65.</HI></NOTE>. A Hawk would serve the purpose full as well. <HI>Pliny</HI> mentions the use of bird-lime<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Nat.</HI> lib. xci. c. 44.</NOTE>; and <HI>Longus,</HI> in his elegant romance of <HI>Daphnis</HI> and <HI>Chloe,</HI> employs the latter to catch little birds for his beloved<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fr.</HI> ed. octavo, 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I cannot find any certainty of Hawks being trained for diversion before the time of King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> monarch; who died in the year 760<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Saxon Chr. <HI>60.</HI></NOTE>. He wrote into <HI>Germany</HI> for a brace of Falcons, which would fly at Cranes and bring them to the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Quoted by Mr.</HI> Whitaker <HI>in</HI> Hist.

barossa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spelman's Gloss.</NOTE>, who was drowned in 1189. By the application of <HI>Ethelbert</HI> to <HI>Boniface,</HI> archbishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> for the brace of Falcons, it is evi∣dent, that the diversion was in perfection in <HI>Germany</HI> before the year 752, the time in which that prelate was martyred by the Pagans. It seems to me highly probable, that falconry was invented in <HI>Scythia,</HI> and passed from thence into the northern parts of <HI>Europe. Tartary</HI> is even at present celebrated for its fine breed of Falcons; and the sport is in such general esteem, that, according to <HI>Olearius, there was no hut but what had its Eagle or Falcon</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Olearius's travels, <HI>177.</HI></NOTE>. The boundless plains of that country are as finely adapted to the diversion, as the wooded or mountanous nature of most part of <HI>Europe</HI> is ill calculated for that rapid amusement.</P>
<P>The antiquity of falconry in <HI>Tartary</HI> is evinced by the exhibition of the sport on the very antient tombs <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strahlenberg,</HI> tab. A. B.</NOTE> found in that country; in which are figured horsemen at full speed, with Hawks on their hands: others again, in the same attitude, discharging their arrows at their game, in the very manner of the antient <HI>Scythians.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Germany,</HI> falconry got footing in <HI>England;</HI> and became so favored a diversion, that even sanguinary laws were enacted for the preservation of rapacious fowls. <HI>Edward</HI> III. made it death for the stealing of a Hawk: and to take its eggs, even in a person's own ground, was punishable with a fine at the king's pleasure, and im∣prisonment for a year and a day. In the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. the amuse∣ment was carried to such an extravagant pitch, that Sir <HI>Thomas Mon∣son</HI> is said to have given a thousand pounds for a cast of Hawks.</P>

<P>Inhabit from the province of <HI>New York</HI> to the kingdom of <HI>Mexico.</HI> In <HI>North America</HI> they are called Red-winged Starlings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> and Swamp Black-birds; in <HI>Mexico, Commendadores,</HI> from their red shoulders, resembling a badge worn by the commanders of a certain <HI>Spanish</HI> order. That kingdom seems to be their most southern resi∣dence. They appear in <HI>New York</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> and leave the coun∣try in <HI>October.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> They probably continue the whole year in the southern parts, at lest <HI>Catesby</HI> and <HI>Lawson</HI> make no mention of their departure. They are seen in flocks innumerable, obscuring at times the very sky with their multitudes. They were esteemed the pest of the colonies, making most dreadful havock among the maize and other grain, both when new sown, and when ripe. They are very bold, and not to be terrified with a gun; for, notwithstanding the sportsman makes slaughter in a flock, the remainder will take a short flight, and settle again in the same field. The farmers some∣times attempt their destruction, by steeping the maize in a decoction
<PB N="256" REF="74"/>
of white hellebore before they plant it. The birds which eat this prepared corn are seized with a vertigo, and fall down; which some∣times drives the rest away. This potion is particularly aimed against the PURPLE GRAKLES, or PURPLE JACKDAW, which consorts in my∣riads with this species, as if in conspiracy against the labors of the hus∣bandman. The fowler seldom shoots among the flocks, but some of each kind fall. They appear in greatest numbers in autumn, when they receive additions from the retired parts of the country, in order to prey on the ripened maize.</P>
<P>Some of the colonies have established a reward of three pence a dozen for the extirpation of the Jackdaws: and in <HI>New England,</HI> the intent was almost effected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE> to the cost of the inhabitants; who at length discovered that Providence had not formed even these seem∣ingly destructive birds in vain. Notwithstanding they caused such havock among the grain, they made ample recompence, by clearing the ground of the noxious worms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Caterpillar of the <HI>Bruchus Pisi,</HI> or Pease Beetle, in particular. See <HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 173. 176.</NOTE> with which it abounds. As soon as the birds were destroyed, the reptiles had full leave to multiply: the consequence was the total loss of the grass, in 1749; when the <HI>New Englanders,</HI> late repentants, were obliged to get their hay from <HI>Pensylvania,</HI> and even from <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NEST.</NOTE>The Red-winged Orioles build their nests in bushes, and among the reeds, in retired swamps, in the form of a hang-nest; leaving it suspended at so judicious a height, and by so wondrous an instinct, that the highest floods never reach to destroy it. The nest is strong, made externally with broad grass, a little plastered; thickly lined with bent or withered grass. The eggs are white, thinly and irre∣gularly streaked with black.</P>
<P><HI>Fernandez</HI> says, that in <HI>Mexico</HI> they build in trees near towns; and both he and <HI>Catesby</HI> agree, that they sing as well in a state of con∣finement as of nature; and that they may be taught to speak. I agree with <HI>M. de Buffon,</HI> that, in case the manner of their nidification
<PB N="257" REF="75"/>
is as <HI>Fernandez</HI> asserts, the disagreement in the different countries is very wonderful.</P>
<P>In <HI>Louisiana</HI> they appear only in winter, and are taken in a clap∣net, placed on each side of a beaten path made on purpose, and strewed over with rice. As soon as the birds alight, the fowler draws the net, and sometimes takes three hundred at a haul. They are also eaten in the <HI>English</HI> colonies. <HI>Fernandez</HI> does not commend their flesh, which, he says, is unpalatable and unwholesome.</P>
<P><HI>Du Pratz</HI> speaks of two kinds: this, and another which is grey and black, with a red shoulder; like the species in question.<NOTE PLACE="marg">YOUNG, OR FEMALES?</NOTE> I suspect he forms out of the young birds, not yet arrived at full color, a new kind; or perhaps a female bird: for I have received from Dr. <HI>Gar∣den</HI> one under that title, which agrees with the description given by M. <HI>Du Pratz.</HI> These are streaked with pale rusty brown: cheeks black: over each eye a white line: breast and belly black, spotted with pale brown: lesser coverts of the wings rich orange.</P>

<P>These birds inhabit the same countries as the Red-wing <HI>Orioles,</HI> and generally mingle with them.

After that grain is carried in, they feed on the seeds of the Water Tare Grass, or <HI>Zizania aquatica.</HI> Their good qualities, in clearing the country from noxious insects, have been recited before, in page mixed with the history of their congenial companions.</P>

with bents and fibres, with plaister at the bottom. They lay five or six eggs, of a pale plue color, thinly spotted and striped with black. After the breeding-season, they return with their young from their most distant quarters, in flights continuing for miles in length, blackening the very sky, in order to make their depredations on the ripening maize. It is unfortunate that they increase in proportion as the country is more cultivated; following the maize, in places they were before unknown, wheresoever that grain is introduced.</P>
<P>They migrate from the northern colonies at approach of winter; but continue in <HI>Carolina</HI> the whole year, feeding about the barn∣door. Their flesh is rank, and unpalatable; and is only the food of birds of prey. The small Hawks dash among the flocks, and catch them in the air.</P>
<P>They are also found in <HI>Mexico,</HI> and in the island of <HI>Jamaica.</HI> They are sometimes eaten; but their flesh is hard, rank, and of bad nourishment.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE>This bird, so admirable for its minuteness, vast swiftness of flight, food, and elegance of form and colors, gave rise to numbers of ro∣mantic tales. They were not the <HI>Europeans</HI> alone, who were struck with its great beauty; the natives of <HI>America,</HI> to whom it was so fa∣miliar, were affected with its gemmeous appearance, and bestowed on it titles expressive of its resplendent colors. Some nations called it <HI>Ourissia,</HI> and <HI>Guaracyaba,</HI> or the Sun-beam; others, <HI>Guanaeygaba,</HI> or Hairs of the Sun; others again named it <HI>Huitzitzil,</HI> or <HI>Vicililin,</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="107"/>
or the <HI>Regenerated;</HI> because they believed it died annually, and was re-animated at the return of the flowers it fed on: that it stuck its bill into the trunk of a tree, and remained lifeless for six months; when the vital powers re-migrated, and restored to nature one of its most brilliant wonders.</P>
<P>It flies with a swiftness which the eye is incapable of following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SWIFTNESS.</NOTE> The motion of the wings is so rapid as to be imperceptible to the nicest observer. Lightning is scarcely more transient than its flight, nor the glare more bright than its colors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE> It never feeds but upon wing, suspended over the flower it extracts nourishment from; for its only food is the honied juice lodged in the nectarium, which it sucks through the tubes of its curious tongue. Like the Bee, hav∣ing exhausted the honey of one flower, it wanders to the next, in search of new sweets. It admires most those flowers which have the deepest tubes. Thus the female <HI>Balsamine,</HI> and the Scarlet <HI>Monarda,</HI> are particular favorites. Whosoever sets those plants before the win∣dow is sure to be visited by multitudes of these diminutive birds. It is a most entertaining sight to see them swarming around the flowers, and trying every tube of verticillated plants, by putting their bills into every one which encircles the stalk. If they find that their brethren have been beforehand, and robbed the flower of the honey, they will, in rage, pluck off, and throw it on the ground.</P>
<P>The most violent passions animate at times their little bodies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">RAGE.</NOTE> They have often dreadful contests, when numbers happen to dispute possession of the same flower. They will tilt against one another with such fury, as if they meant to transfix their antagonists with their long bills. During the fight; they frequently pursue the conquered into the apartments of those houses whose windows are left open, take a turn round the room, as Flies do in <HI>England,</HI> and then sud∣denly regain the open air. They are fearless of mankind; and in feeding will suffer people to come within two yards of them; but on a nearer approach, dart away with admirable swiftness.</P>
<P><HI>Fernandez Oviedo,</HI> an author of great repute, speaks from his own knowlege of the spirited instinct, even of this diminutive bird, in
<PB N="288" REF="108"/>
defence of its young: <Q>So that when they see a man clime y<SUP>e</SUP> tree where they have their nests, they flee at his face, and stryke hym in the eyes, commyng, goying, and returnyng, with such swyft∣ness, that no man woulde lyghtly beleeve it, that hath not seene it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of West Indies, <HI>translated by</HI> Richard Eden, <HI>p. 199.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Father <HI>Charlevoix</HI> gives a more apocryphal instance of the courage of this bird, in its attack on its disproportioned enemy the Raven. As soon as the last appears, the Honeysucker flies up like lightning, beds itself beneath the Raven's wing, and, piercing him with his needle-like bill, till the bird is heard to croak with agony, at length tumbles to the ground dead, either from the fall or the wound. This relation seems of a piece with the combat of the Wren with the Eagle, mentioned by <HI>Aristotle</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. An.</HI> lib. ix. c. 11. vol. i. 931.—<HI>Charlevoix,</HI> v. 232.</NOTE>: but, to do justice both to the <HI>French</HI> voyager and <HI>Grecian</HI> philosopher, I must add, that each of them de∣livered their reports from oral evidence.</P>
<P>Many fables have been related of the melody of the song of these birds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">NOTE.</NOTE> In fact, their only note is <HI>screep, screep, screep;</HI> but the noise which they make with their wings, especially in the morning, when numbers are in motion, is a sort of buzz or sound resembling that of a spinning-wheel. Their note is chiefly emitted when they happen to strike against each other in their flight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NESTS.</NOTE>Their nests are found with great difficulty, being built in the branch of a tree, amidst the thick foliage. It is of elegance suitable to the architects; formed on the outside with moss; in the inside lined with the down or gossamer collected from the Great Mullein, or <HI>Verbascum Thapsus;</HI> but it is also sometimes made of flax, hemp, hair, and other soft materials. It is of an hemispherical shape. Its inner diameter an inch: its depth half an inch. The female is said to be the builder; the male supplying her with materials. Each assists in the labor of incubation, which continues during twelve days. They lay only two eggs, white, and as small as pease. The first is very sin∣gular,
<PB N="289" REF="109"/>
and contrary to the general rule of nature; which makes, in all other instances, the smallest and most defenceless birds the most prolific. The reasons of the exception in this case are double. The smallness of their bodies causes them commonly to escape the eyes of birds of prey; or if seen, their rapid flight eludes pursuit: so that the species is preserved as fully as if they had been the most nume∣rous breeders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Mexico, Peru,</HI> and <HI>Maynas,</HI> make most exquisite pictures of the feathers of birds; but those of the Honeysuckers form the most brilliant part. Some use them as ornaments, and hang them as pendants in their ears, which give a blaze emulous of the Ruby and Emerald. In order to compose pictures, the <HI>Indians</HI> draw off the feathers with small pincers, and with fine paste most artfully join them together. They dispose them with such skill, as to give the true lights and shade to the performance, and imitate nature with the greatest fidelity. These were meant to decorate the idols and temples; for, before the depression of the <HI>Indian</HI> spirit by the tyranny of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> religion was highly cultivated among the <HI>Mexicans</HI> and <HI>Peruvians;</HI> and, notwithstanding it was cruel, was attended with great splendor.</P>
<P>The generical name (in the <HI>Brasilian</HI> tongue) of these birds, is <HI>Guianumbi.</HI> There are several species, but only one which is found in <HI>North America.</HI> This kind is found from <HI>Canada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> through that great continent, as low as <HI>Louisiana,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Brasils.</HI> It breeds even in the northern climate of <HI>Canada;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MIGRATES.</NOTE> but retires not only from thence, but even from the warm provinces of <HI>Carolina,</HI> at ap∣proach of winter. In <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> the mountains of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the <HI>Brasils,</HI> countries where there are a perpetual succession of flowers, they reside throughout the year.</P>

<P>T. With the characters described in the definition of the genus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCRIPTION.</NOTE> Color of the plumage dark, glossed with variable copper co∣lor and green: coverts of the wings, and the quil-feathers, barred with black and white. Tail consists of two orders; the upper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAIL.</NOTE> or shorter, very elegant; the ground color a bright bay; the middle feathers marked with numerous bars of shining black and green; the greatest part of the exterior feathers of the same ground with the others, marked with only three broad bands of mallard green, placed remote from each other; the two next are colored like those of the middle; but the end is plain, and crossed with a single bar, like the exterior.</P>
<P>The longer, or lower order, were of a rusty white color, mottled with black, and crossed with numerous narrow waved lines of the same color, and near the end with a broad band.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="112"/>Wild Turkies preserve a sameness of coloring. The tame, as usual with domestic animals, vary. It is needless to point out the diffe∣rences, in so well-known a bird. The black approach nearest to the original stock. This variety I have seen nearly in a state of nature, in <HI>Richmond</HI> and other parks. A most beautiful kind has of late been introduced into <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHITE VARIETY.</NOTE> of a snowy whiteness, finely contrasting with its red head, and black pectoral tuft. These, I think, came out of <HI>Holland,</HI> probably bred from an accidental white pair; and from them preserved pure from any dark or variegated birds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIZE.</NOTE>The sizes of the wild Turkies have been differently represented. Some writers assert, that there have been instances of their weighing sixty pounds; but I find none who, speaking from their own know∣lege, can prove their weight to be above forty. <HI>Josselyn</HI> says, that he has eaten part of a Cock, which, after it was plucked, and the en∣trails taken out, weighed thirty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New England Rarities, <HI>8.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Lawson,</HI> whose authority is un∣questionable, saw half a Turkey serve eight hungry men for two meals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Carolina, <HI>149 and 27.</HI></NOTE>; and says, that he had seen others, which, he believed, weighed forty pounds. <HI>Catesby</HI> tells us, that out of the many hundreds which he had handled<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">App. xliv. The greatest certain weight is given by Mr. <HI>Clayton,</HI> who saw one that reached 38 lb.—<HI>Ph. Trans.</HI></NOTE>, very few exceeded thirty pounds. Each of these speak of their being double that size, merely from the reports of others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE>The manners of these birds are as singular as their figure. Their attitudes in the season of courtship are very striking. The males fling their heads and neck backwards, bristle up their feathers, drop their wings to the ground, strut and pace most ridiculously; wheel round the females, with their wings rustling along the earth, at the same time emitting a strange found through their nostrils, not unlike the <HI>grurr</HI> of a great spinning-wheel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">NOTES.</NOTE> On being interrupted, fly into great rages, and change their note into a loud and guttural gobble; and then return to dalliance.</P>
<P>The sound of the females is plaintive and melancholy.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="113"/>The passions of the males are very strongly expressed by the change of colors in the fleshy substance of the head and neck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IRASCIBLE.</NOTE> which alters to red, white, blue, and yellowish, as they happen to be affected. The sight of any thing red excites their choler greatly.</P>
<P>They are polygamous, one cock serving or hens.<NOTE PLACE="marg">POLYGAMOUS.</NOTE> They lay in the spring; and will lay a great number of eggs. They will persist in laying for a great while. They retire to some obscure place to sit, the cock, through rage at loss of its mate, being very apt to break the eggs. The females are very affectionate to the young, and make great moan on the loss of them. They sit on their eggs with such perseverance, that, if they are not taken away when addle, the hens will almost perish with hunger before they will quit the nest.</P>
<P>Turkies greatly delight in the seeds of nettles; but those of the purple Fox-glove prove fatal to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Buffon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They are very stupid birds; quarrelsome, and cowardly. It is diverting to see a whole flock attack the common Cock; who will for a long time keep a great number at bay.</P>
<P>They are very swift runners, in the tame as well as the wild state.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SWIFT.</NOTE> They are but indifferent flyers. They love to perch on trees;<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERCH HIGH.</NOTE> and gain the height they wish, by rising from bough to bough. In a wild state, they get to the very summit of the loftiest trees, even so high as to be beyond the reach of the musquet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>45.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the state of nature they go in flocks even of five hundred<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>149.</HI></NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREGARIOUS.</NOTE> Feed much on the small red acorns; and grow so fat in <HI>March,</HI> that they cannot fly more than three or four hundred yards, and are then soon run down by a horseman. In the unfrequented parts bordering on the <HI>Missisipi,</HI> they are so tame as to be shot with even a pistol<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Adair's Amer. <HI>360.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They frequent the great swamps <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It is in the swamps that the loftiest and most bulky trees grow: the wet, with which they are environed, makes them a most secure retreat.</NOTE> of their native country;<NOTE PLACE="marg">HAUNTS.</NOTE> and leave them at sun-rising to repair to the dry woods, in search of
<PB N="294" REF="114"/>
acorns, and various berries; and before sun-set retire to the swamps to roost.</P>
<P>The flesh of the wild Turkey is said to be superior in goodness to the tame, but redder. Eggs of the former have been taken from the nest, and hatched under tame Turkies; the young will still prove wild, perch separate, yet mix and breed together in the season. The <HI>Indians</HI> sometimes use the breed produced from the wild, as decoy-birds, to seduce those in a state of nature within their reach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>149.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Wild Turkies are now grown most excessively rare in the inhabited parts of <HI>America,</HI> and are only found in numbers in the distant and most unfrequented spots.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> make a most elegant cloathing of the feathers. They twist the inner webs into a strong double thread of hemp, or inner bark of the mulberry-tree, and work it like matting. It appears very rich and glossy, and as fine as a silk shag<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>18.</HI> Adair, <HI>423.</HI></NOTE>. They also make fans of the tail; and the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Louisiana</HI> were wont to make um∣brellas by the junction of four of the tails<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 85.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>When disturbed, they do not take to wing, but run out of sight. It is usual to chase them with dogs; when they will fly, and perch on the next tree. They are so stupid, or so insensible of danger, as not to fly on being shot at; but the survivors remain unmoved at the death of their companions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>224.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE>TURKIES are natives only of <HI>America,</HI> or the <HI>New World;</HI> and of course unknown to the antients.

It appears from him, that the Turkey was in his days an inhabitant of the greater islands, and of the main land. He speaks of them as Peacocks; for, being a new bird to him, he adopts that name, from the resemblance he thought they bore to the former: <Q>But (says he) the neck is bare of feathers, but covered with a skin which they change after their phantasie into divers colours.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE>The history of this species is very curious: all which I beg leave to transcribe from Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> according to the accounts given him by Mr. <HI>Bartram</HI> and Mr <HI>Brooke,</HI> who had frequent op∣portunity of observing its manners; to which I shall add another, borrowed from the Travels of the Baron <HI>La Hontan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FROM MR. BAR∣TRAM.</NOTE><Q>He is (says Mr. <HI>Bartram</HI>) a fine bird when his gaiety is dis∣played; that is, when he spreads his tail like that of a Turkey-cock, and erects a circle of feathers round his neck like a ruff, walking very stately with an even pace, and making a noise some∣thing like a Turkey; at which time the hunter must fire immedi∣ately at him, or he flies away directly two or three hundred yards, before he settles on the ground. There is something very remark∣able in what we call their thumping; which they do with their wings, by clapping them against their sides, as the hunters say. They stand upon an old fallen tree, that has lain many years on the ground, where they begin their strokes gradually, at about two se∣conds of time distant from one another, and repeat them quicker and quicker, until they make a noise like thunder at a distance; which continues, from the beginning, about a minute; then ceas∣eth for about six or eight minutes before it begins again. The sound is heard near half a mile, by which means they are dis∣covered by the hunters, and many of them killed. I have shot many of them in this position; but never saw them thump, they mostly seeing me first, and so left off. They commonly exercise in thumping spring and fall, at about nine or ten in the morning,
<PB N="303" REF="123"/>
and four or five in the afternoon. Their food is chiefly ber∣ries and seeds of the country: their flesh is white, and choice food. I believe they breed but once a year, in the spring, and hatch twelve or fourteen at a brood; which keep in a company till the following spring. Many have attempted to raise the young ones, and to tame them; but to no purpose. When hatched under a hen, they escape into the woods soon after they are hatched, where they either find means to subsist, or perish.</Q></P>
<P>The history of this bird is thus further illustrated by Mr. <HI>Brooke</HI> of <HI>Maryland,</HI> in <HI>North America:</HI> <Q>The ruffed Grous, or Pheasant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MR. BROOKE.</NOTE> breeds in all parts of <HI>Maryland,</HI> some countries on the Eastern shore excepted. They lay their eggs in nests they make in the leaves, either by the side of fallen trees, or the roots of standing ones. They lay from twelve to sixteen eggs: the time of incu∣bation is in the spring; but how long their eggs are hatching I cannot say; but probably it is three weeks, the time that a Dunghill Hen sits. I have found their nests when a boy, and have endeavoured to take the old Pheasant, but never could succeed: she would almost let me put my hand upon her before she would quit her nest; then by artifice she would draw me off from her eggs, by fluttering just before me for a hundred paces or more; so that I have been in constant hopes of taking her. They leave their nests as soon as they are hatched; and I believe they live at first on ants, small worms, &amp;c. When they are a few days old, they hide themselves so artfully among the leaves, that it is dif∣ficult to find them: as they grow up, they feed on various berries, fruits, and grain of the country: grapes they likewise are fond of in the season; but the Pheasant is more particularly fond of the ivy-berry. I do not know any other animal that feeds on this berry: I know it is poison to many. Though the Pheasant hatches many young at a time, and often sits twice a year, the great num∣ber and variety of Hawks in <HI>Maryland</HI> feeding on them, prevents their increasing fast. The beating of the Pheasant, as we term it, is a noise chiefly made in the spring of the year by the cock-bird;
<PB N="304" REF="124"/>
it may be distinctly heard a mile in a calm day: they swell their breasts like the Powting Pigeon, and heat with their wings, which make a noise not unlike a drum in sound; but the Pheasant shor∣tens each sounding note, till they run one into another undistin∣guishably, like striking two empty bottles together.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LA HONTAN.</NOTE>In order to perfect, as far as I am able, the history of this bird, I shall give a quotation from Baron <HI>La Hontan's Voyages to North America,</HI> published in <HI>English,</HI> (vol. i. p. 67.) where he speaks of a bird found near the lakes of <HI>Canada,</HI> which, I think, can be no other than the above-described, though the names given them disagree.</P>
<P><HI>La Hontan</HI> says, <Q>I went in company with some <HI>Canadese</HI> on purpose to see that fowl flap with its wings: believe me, this sight is one of the greatest curiosities in the world; for their flapping makes a noise much like a drum, for about the space of a minute; then the noise ceases for half a quarter of an hour; after which it begins again. By this noise we were directed to the place where the unfortunate More-hen sat, and found them upon rotten mossy trees. By flapping one wing against the other they mean to call their mates; and the humming noise that ensues thereupon may be heard half a quarter of a league. This they do in the months of <HI>April, May, September,</HI> and <HI>October;</HI> and, which is very re∣markable, the More-hen never flaps in this manner but upon one tree. It begins at break of day, and gives over at nine o'clock in the morning, till about an hour before sun-set, then it flutters again, and continues so to do till night.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. GRAHAM.</NOTE>To these accounts I beg leave to add the following, out of the <HI>Philosophical Transactions;</HI> which informs us, that this species of Grous bears the <HI>Indian</HI> name of <HI>Puskee,</HI> or <HI>Puspuskee,</HI> at <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> on account of the leanness and dryness of their flesh, which is extreme∣ly white, and of a very close texture; but when well prepared, is excellent eating. They are pretty common at <HI>Moose Fort</HI> and <HI>Henly House;</HI> but are seldom seen at <HI>Albany Fort,</HI> or to the northward of the above places. In winter they feed upon juniper-tops, in summer on gooseberries, raspberries, currants, cranberries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They are not
<PB N="305" REF="125"/>
migratory; staying all the year at <HI>Moose Fort:</HI> they build their nest on dry ground, hatch nine young at a time, to which the mother clucks as our common hens do; and, on the lest appearance of danger, or in order to enjoy an agreeable degree of warmth, the young ones retire under the wings of their parent.</P>

<P>The natives distinguish the kinds. The larger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NORWEGIANS DISTINGUISH TWO KINDS.</NOTE> which inhabits forests, is styled by them <HI>Skorv Rype,</HI> or the Wood Grous; the lesser, which lives in the mountains, is called <HI>Fiaeld Rype,</HI> or the Mountain Grous<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Russian</HI> White Grous inhabits indifferently woods, mountains, plains, and marshes. The <HI>British</HI> species or variety is in <HI>Russia</HI> about half the size of the <HI>Sibirian</HI> kind.</NOTE>. They all burrow under the snow; and form extensive walks beneath. There they feed, especially in <HI>Lapland,</HI> on
<PB N="310" REF="130"/>
the seeds of the dwarf birch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fl. Lap. <HI>268.</HI></NOTE>, and in the season on variety of berries of mountain plants. During winter they are taken and brought to <HI>Bergen</HI> by thousands; are half roasted, and put into firkins, and transported to other countries<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan, <HI>ii. 92.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The lesser variety is not unknown in <HI>America.</HI> The sort here described is found in amazing quantities, especially about <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> where they breed in all parts along the coasts, make their nests on dry ridges on the ground, and lay from nine to eleven eggs, powdered with black.</P>
<P>This is the only species of Grous in <HI>N. America</HI> to which Providence hath given that warm protection to its feet, evidently to secure them against the cold of their winter lodgings: and, as they are greatly sought after by Eagles, Owls, and other birds of prey, a fine provision is made for their safety, by the change of color, which renders them not to be distinguished from the snow they lie on.</P>
<P>Every morning they take a flight into the air directly upwards, to shake the snow from their wings and bodies. They feed in the mornings and evenings, and in the middle of the day bask in the sun. In the morning they call to one another with a loud note, interrupted; feeding in the intervals, and calling again.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> they assemble in flocks of two hundred, and live much among the willows, the tops of which they eat; whence they are called <HI>Willow Partridges.</HI> About the beginning of <HI>December</HI> they appear in less plenty, retiring from the flats about the settlements on <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> to the mountains, where in that month the snow is less deep than in the lowlands, to feed on cranberries and other berries<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Drage's Voy. <HI>i. 174.</HI></NOTE>. In <HI>Greenland</HI> they resort in summer to the mountains for the sake of the crowberries<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Empetrum Nigrum. See <HI>Crantz. Greenl.</HI> i. 64, 75.</NOTE>, which they eat even with the leaves of the plant. In winter they descend to the shores, where the winds sweep the snow off the rocks, and enable them to pick up a sustenance.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="131"/>They are an excellent food, and much searched after by the <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI> in <HI>Hudson's Bay.</HI> They are generally as tame as chickens, especially in a mild day: sometimes they are rather wild; but by being driven about, or shot at with powder, they grow so weary, by the short flights they take, as soon to become very tame again. Sometimes the hunters, when they see the birds likely to take a long flight, imitate the crying of a Hawk, which intimidates them so much, that they instantly settle. When the female is killed, the male can scarcely be forced from the body of its mate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faun. Groenl. <HI>p. 117.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The usual method of taking them is in nets made of twine, twen∣ty feet square, fastened to four poles, and supported in front in a perpendicular direction with sticks. A long line is fastened to these props, the end of which is held by a person who lies concealed at a distance. Several people are then employed to drive the birds within reach of the net, which is then pulled down, and often covers at one haul fifty or seventy. At this time they are so plentiful, that ten thousand are taken for the use of the settlement from <HI>November</HI> to the end of <HI>April.</HI> In former days, they must have been infinite∣ly more numerous; for Sir <HI>Thomas Button</HI> relates, that when he wintered there in 1612, he took eighteen hundred dozens of these and other fowl<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quoted in <HI>North-west Fox,</HI> 228.</NOTE>: but this is a trifle to the success of M. <HI>Jeremie,</HI> who asserts, that there were eaten in one winter, between himself and seventy-nine others, ninety thousand Grous, and twenty-five thou∣sand Rabbets<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Recucil de Voy. au Nord. iii. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Laplanders</HI> take them by forming a hedge with the boughs of birch-trees; leaving small openings at certain intervals, and hang in each a snare. The birds are tempted to come and feed on the buds or catkins of the birch; and whenever they endeavour to pass through the openings they are instantly caught.</P>

The BLACK GROUS are soon attracted by the corn on the horizontal poles; first alight on them, and after a short repast fly to the baskets, attempt to settle on their tops, when the wheel drops sideways, and they fall headlong into the trap, which is sometimes found half full.</P>

<P><Q>I think,</Q> says Mr. <HI>Blackburne,</HI> <Q>this as remarkable a bird as any in <HI>America.</HI> They are in vast numbers in all parts, and have been of great service at particular times to our garrisons, in sup∣plying them with fresh meat, especially at the out-posts. A friend told me, that in the year in which <HI>Quebec</HI> was taken, the whole army was supplied with them, if they chose it. The way was this: every man took his club (for they were forbid to use their firelocks) when they <HI>flew,</HI> as it was termed, in such quan∣tities, that each person could kill as many as he wanted. They in general begin to fly soon after day-break, and continue till nine or ten o'clock; and again about three in the afternoon, and continue till five or six: but what is very remarkable, they always fly westerly. The times of flying here are in the spring, about the latter end of <HI>February</HI> or the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> and continue every day for eight or ten days; and again in the fall, when they begin the latter end of <HI>July</HI> or the beginning of <HI>August.</HI> They catch vast quantities of them in clap-nets, with stale pigeons. I have seen them brought to this market by sacks-full. People in general are very fond of them; and I have heard many say they think them as good as our common Blue Pigeon; but I cannot agree with them by any means. They taste more like our Queest, or Wild Pigeon; but are better meat. They have another way of killing them—They make a hut of boughs of trees, and six stale Pigeons on the ground at a small distance from the hut. They plant poles for the Wild Pigeons to light on when they come a <HI>salting</HI> (as they term it) which they do every morning in the season, repairing to the marshes near the sea-side; then the persons in the hut pull the stale Pigeon, when the birds will alight in vast numbers on the poles, and great multitudes are shot. Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> told me, that he killed at one shot with a blunderbuss, a hundred and twenty or thirty.
<PB N="326" REF="146"/>
Some years past they have not been in such plenty as they used to be. This spring I saw them fly one morning, as I thought in great abundance; but every body was amazed how few there were; and wondered at the reason.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I must remark one very singular fact: that, notwithstanding the whole people of a town go out a <HI>pigeoning,</HI> as they call it, they will not on some days kill a single hen bird; and on the very next day, not a single cock (and yet both sexes always fly westerly); and when this is the case, the people are always assured that there will be great plenty of them that season. I have been at <HI>Niagara</HI> when the centinel has given the word that the Pigeons were <HI>flying;</HI> and the whole garrison were ready to run over one another, so eager were they to get fresh meat.</Q></P>

<P>WITH a spotted breast; probably a young bird of one of the others.</P>
<P>These birds shun the cold parts of <HI>America;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> and are found from the province of <HI>New York</HI> as far south as <HI>Mexico</HI> and the <HI>Antilles.</HI> They are so impatient of the rigorous season, as to retire at ap∣proach of winter from all the provinces north of <HI>Carolina</HI> or <HI>Vir∣ginia.</HI> In the first they inhabit the whole year. They visit <HI>New York</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> but are rather scarce in that part of <HI>America:</HI> they breed there in <HI>June,</HI> and lay five or six blue eggs, thickly spotted with dull red.</P>
<P>They build often in fruit trees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lawson.</NOTE>; are very familiar, and love to be conversant about dwellings; and, during summer, usually deliver
<PB N="334" REF="155"/>
their song perched on the chimney's top. During breeding season, are very shy, and will desert their nest if any one looks on the eggs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 218.</NOTE>: but are sometimes preserved, and brought alive to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>During summer they feed on berries, mulberries, and other fruits, and insects. In winter, when other food is scarce, on the berries of the <HI>Dogwood</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cornus Florida, <HI>Lin. Sp. Pl.</HI></NOTE>. When tamed, feed on every thing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VARIOUS SONG.</NOTE>These birds are perhaps the first among the choristers of the woods; and are justly famed not only for the variety, fulness, and melody of their own notes, but their imitative faculty of the notes of all other birds or animals, from the Humming-bird to the Eagle. They will even imitate the sound of other things. I have heard of one, confined in a cage, that would mimic the mewing of a cat, the chattering of a magype, and the creaking of a sign in high winds. The <HI>Mexicans</HI> call them <HI>Cencontlatolli</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fernandez, <HI>p. 20.</HI></NOTE>, or the birds of four hundred tongues, on account of their vast variety of notes and imitative powers. In the warmer parts of <HI>America</HI> they sing incessantly from <HI>March</HI> to <HI>August,</HI> day and night, beginning with their own compositions, and then finishing by borrowing from the whole feathered choir, and repeat their tunes with such artful sweetness, as to excite pleasure and surprize. The super-excellence of their songs makes ample amends for the plainness of their plumage.</P>
<P>They may be said not only to sing, but dance: for, as if excited by a sort of extasy at their own admirable notes, they gradually raise themselves from the place where they stand, with their wings ex∣tended, drop with their head down to the same spot, and whirl round with distended wings, accompanying their melody with variety of pretty gesticulations<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Catesby.</NOTE>. They are birds of vast courage; and will attack any large bird.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NESTS.</NOTE>They make their nests with roots, moss, &amp;c.; and lay five eggs, of a most lively sea-green colour. The cock is most assiduous in assisting its mate in making the nest and feeding the young; and in the intervals chears her with its musical voice.</P>
<P>Like the <HI>English</HI> Fieldfare, they come and go in large flocks. They have two notes; one a loud scream, like the Missel-bird: the other, a very sweet song, which it delivers from the summit of some lofty tree.</P>
<P>They feed on worms, insects, and berries. Mr. <HI>Catesby</HI> brings a proof, that it is not the heat of the season alone that forces them away.

I am not certain of the winter retreat of these birds out of <HI>Hudson's Bay;</HI> but having seen one of this species among those sent to Mrs. <HI>Blackburn</HI> from <HI>New York,</HI> I imagine that they spread over the more southern parts of <HI>North America</HI> in the rigorous season, as they do over <HI>Europe</HI> in the same period.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHANGE OF COLOR.</NOTE>These birds have a summer and a winter dress. The first we have described. Against the rigorous season they become white on their head, neck, and whole under side: great part of their wings, and the rump, assumes the same color: the back, and middle fea∣thers of the tail, are black. But <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> who was very well ac∣quainted with this species, says, that they vary according to age and season. Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> sent to the Royal Society two specimens; one in its summer feathers, which exactly answered to our TAWNY BUNTING, N<SUP>o</SUP> 121; the other, to our SNOW BUNTING, N<SUP>o</SUP> 122, in its winter feathers.

<HI>September,</HI> while the rice is yet milky; and commit such devastations, that forty acres of that grain have been totally ruined by them in a small time.</P>
<P>They arrive very lean; but soon grow so fat, as to fly with diffi∣culty; and, when shot, often burst with the fall.

<P>It is very singular, that, among the myriads which pay their autumnal visit, there never is found a single cock-bird.

Mr. <HI>Catesby</HI> gives so very good an account of its manners, and singular spirit, that I beg leave to express it in his own words:—<Q>The courage of this little bird is singular. He pursues and puts to flight all kinds of birds that come near his station, from the smallest to the largest, none escaping his fury; nor did I ever see any that dared to oppose him while flying, for he does not offer to attack them when sitting. I have seen one of them fix on the back of an Eagle, and persecute him so, that he has turned on his back into various postures in the air, in order to get rid of him; and at last was forced to alight on the top of the next tree, from whence he dared not to move, till the little Tyrant was tired, or thought fit to leave him. This is the constant practice of the cock, while the hen is brooding: he sits on the top of a bush, or small tree, not far from her nest; near which, if any small birds approach, he drives them away; but the great ones, as Crows, Hawks, and Eagles, he won't suffer to come within a quarter of a mile of him without attacking them.

<P>The colors of the FEMALE are less glossy on the upper part of the body; below of a dirty white: in some, the ridge of the wings is white, and the breast grey.

away, and pursuing with great noise, Crows, Hawks, and all kinds of vermin. On the approach of any thing noxious, they set up a loud note; which the chickens consider as an alarm, and instantly run under shelter.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE>Their food is entirely insects, which they catch night and morn∣ing, at the time in which they emit their song. They never settle
<PB N="435" REF="259"/>
on high trees; but on bushes, rails, or the steps of houses, which they frequent, as insects swarm more, near to habitations, than other places. They give their note sitting: if they see an insect pass, they fly up, catch it, and then settle again, and renew their song. Oft-times numbers perch near one another, make a vast noise, repeat∣ing their song as if in emulation. They continue their call till it is quite dark: their note ceases during night; but commences at the dawn, and is continued till the sun rises, when they again desist for the whole day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> ii. 153.</NOTE>.

<P>They are extremely rare towards the sea-side; but swarm towards the mountains. Doctor <HI>Garden</HI> never got but this one. Mr. <HI>Clayton</HI> confirms their scarcity in the maritime parts of the provinces; and favors us with the following account of them.</P>
<P><Q>I never heard but one in the maritime parts; though my abode has been always there; but near the mountains, within a few mi∣nutes after sun-set, they begin, and make so shrill and loud a noise, which the echoes from the rocks and sides of the mountains increase to such a degree, that the first time I lodged there I could hardly get any sleep. The shooting them in the night is very difficult; they never appearing in the day. Their cry is pretty much like the sound of the pronunciation of the words <HI>Whip poor Will,</HI> with a kind of a <HI>chucking</HI> between every other, or every two or three cries; and they lay the accent upon the last word <HI>Will,</HI> and lest of all upon the middle one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Indians</HI> say, these birds were never known till a great massacre was made of their country folks by the <HI>English,</HI> and that they are the departed spirits of the massacred <HI>Indians.</HI> Abundance of people here look upon them as birds of ill omen, and are very

In <HI>Guiana</HI> it is often domesticated, so as never to leave the poultry yard. It shews great courage in attacking the fowls, and will even oppose itself to the cat.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIZE.</NOTE>ALBATROSSES differ greatly in size. Whether they differ in species I cannot determine. They weigh from twelve to twenty-eight pounds: and vary in extent of wings, from seven feet seven inches to ten feet seven.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE>The white and the brown variety or species appear annually in flocks of thousands, about the end of <HI>June,</HI> and spread over the whole <HI>Ochotschan</HI> sea, the gulph of <HI>Penschinshi,</HI> and the <HI>Kurile</HI> islands; but very rarely on the eastern coast of <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> They also arrived in great numbers about <HI>Bering</HI>'s Island, at the time when <HI>Steller</HI> was preparing to depart from his long confinement, after the shipwreck of his illustrious commander. He sailed from thence on the 10th of <HI>August.</HI> This coincides with the re-migration of these birds, who re∣tire from the former places about the end of <HI>July</HI> or the middle of <HI>August.</HI> Their arrival is the certain forerunner of fish. It is pro∣bable that they pursue their prey northward, as they do not return the same way. They spread to the coasts of <HI>America</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seen the 4th of <HI>July,</HI> in lat. 56. 30, off the western coast of <HI>America.—Ellis's Voy.</HI> i. 292.</NOTE>, and tend
<PB N="507" REF="333"/>
from each continent to their breeding-places in the southern hemi∣sphere, which they may arrive at by the season of summer in that adverse part of the globe.</P>
<P>They seek the northern shores,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> in pursuit of the vast shoals of sal∣mon which frequent those distant places. They are the most vora∣cious of birds; and will so fill themselves with fish, that sometimes a large one will hang half out of their mouths till those in their stomach are digested. They will be at times so loaden with food as to become incapable of flying; and even so stupified, as to be readily hunted down by boats, or transfixed in the water by darts: neither can they arise till they have vomited up their prey, which they strive to do with all their might.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> are very solicitous about the capture of these birds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTURE.</NOTE> not so much for the sake of their flesh (which is very tough and dry, and never eaten unless hunger compels) but on account of the intestines, which they blow into bladders, in order to form floats for their nets. They angle for the Albatrosses as they do for the scaly race, baiting with a whole fish, a large hook fixed to a long cord. This they fling into the water, when there is an instant con∣test among these greedy birds, which shall first lay hold of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P>They have only the vestige of a tongue; which is one of the cha∣racters of the Gannet, Corvorants, and other voracious birds. Their voice, like that of the Pelecan, resembles the braying of an ass.</P>
<P>The voyage which these birds undertake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MIGRATIONS.</NOTE> from perhaps almost the extremity of the southern hemisphere to that of the northern, urged by instinct, to attend the migration of certain fishes, is very amazing.

They are con∣stantly watched while on their nests by multitudes of Hawks, who no sooner see the Albatross quit its nest, but they instantly dart down and carry off the egg. This obliges them to lay another, and prolong the season of incubation.</P>

<P>Inhabit, in vast numbers, the <HI>Bahama</HI> islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> where they breed on the bare rocks. In the breeding season they, and numbers of other birds, are seen in great flights, flying near the surface of the water, continually dropping on the small fish which are driven to the top, to shun the persecution of the greater. The whole air resounds with the noise of the birds, who seem in full exultation on their success; which is expressed in vast variety of notes. A rippling and whiteness in the water marks the course of the shoals of fish; and above them the air is animated with their feathered enemies. Where the strong∣est rippling is, there appear the thickest swarms of fowls. As soon as the time of nutrition is over, these birds disperse over the ocean separately; and are seen at the distance of hundreds of leagues from land; but very seldom on the outside of the tropics. Their stupi∣dity is notorious; for they will suffer themselves to be taken by the hand, when they settle, as they often do, on the yards of ships.</P>

The swans will run as fast as a tolerable horse. The greater numbers are taken by the dogs, which are taught to catch them by the neck, which causes them to lose their balance, and become an easy prey. Great use is made of the plumage: the flesh is eaten; and the skin of the legs and feet, taken off entire, looks like shagreen, and is used for purses. The eggs are collected in the spring for food<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olaffen, <HI>i. 118.</HI></NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN KAMTSCHATKA.</NOTE> In <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> where they abound both in winter and summer, they are also taken with dogs, in the moulting season; or killed with clubs.

But the most remarkable is the strange figure of the windpipe, which falls into the chest, then turns back like a trumpet, and afterwards makes a second bend to join the lungs. Thus it is enabled to utter a loud and shrill note.

The natives of <HI>Iceland</HI> compare it to the notes of a violin: in fact they hear it at the end of their long and gloomy winter, when the return of the Swans announces the return of summer: every note must be therefore melodious which presages the speedy thaw, and the release from their tedious confinement.</P>

<P>The <HI>English</HI> send out their servants, as well as <HI>Indians,</HI> to shoot these birds on their passage. It is in vain to pursue them: they therefore form a row of huts made of boughs, at musquet-shot dis∣tance from each other, and place them in a line across the vast marshes of the country. Each hovel, or, as they are called, <HI>stand,</HI> is occupied by only a single person. These attend the flight of the birds, and on their approach mimic their cackle so well, that the Geese will answer, and wheel and come nearer the stand. The sportsman keeps motionless, and on his knees, with his gun cocked, the whole time; and never fires till he has seen the eyes of the Geese. He fires as they are going from him, then picks up another gun that lies by him, and discharges that. The Geese which he has killed, he sets up on sticks as if alive, to decoy others; he also makes artificial birds for the same purpose. In a good day (for they fly in very uncertain and unequal numbers) a single <HI>Indian</HI> will kill two hundred. Not∣withstanding every species of Goose has a different call, yet the <HI>Indians</HI> are admirable in their imitation of every one.</P>
<P>The vernal flight of the Geese lasts from the middle of <HI>April</HI> un∣til the middle of <HI>May.</HI> Their first appearance coincides with the thawing of the swamps, when they are very lean.

The inhabitants first place, near the banks of the rivers, a great net, in a strait line,

or else form a hovel of skins sewed together. This done, one of the company dresses himself in the skin of a white rein-deer, advances towards the flock of Geese, and then turns back towards the net or the hovel; and his companions go behind the flock, and, by making a noise, drive them forward. The simple birds mistake the man in white for their leader, and follow him within reach of the net, which is suddenly pulled down, and captivates the whole. When he chuses to conduct them to the hovel, they follow in the same manner; he creeps in at a hole left for that purpose, and out at another on the op∣posite side, which he closes up. The Geese follow him through the first; and as soon as they are got in, he passes round, and secures every one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> use the same method in taking Geese. <HI>Descr.

This freezes, and forms over them an arch; and whenever the family has occasion to open one of these magazines, they find their provision sweet and good.</P>

It is said, that the males are five years old before they come to their full color? that they live to a great age; and will at length grow quite grey. They are constant to their breeding-places: a pair has been ob∣served to occupy the same nest twenty years. They dive to great depths for their food, which is shells of all kinds. The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> kill them with darts; pursue them in their little boats; watch their course (when they dive) by the air-bubbles; and strike them when they arise wearied. The flesh is valued as a food. The skin of this and the next species is the most valuable of all, as a garment placed next to the skin.</P>

The <HI>Sibirians</HI> generally fix on a place where there are two or three lakes near each other, and out between each an avenue through the thick birch woods of the country. If there is not the advantage of adjacent lakes, the avenue is made through the woods which border the sides of any which the birds frequent. At the en∣trance of the glades, on each side, a tall birch-tree is left standing, and all their branches stripped away: from the tops of these naked trees is placed a strong net, which fills the breadth of the avenue: this net is capable of being dropped or raised at pleasure, by means of certain long cords which run along the top; and the ends of which are held by a man who conceals himself in the high grass. The Geese commonly leave the lakes an hour before sun-rise; and, as they do not chuse to fly high at that season, prefer going through the avenues; and with their long extended necks strike into the nets, which are suddenly dropped; and twenty, and often more, of the Geese are taken at a time.

<P>P. With a bill fifteen inches long, flat, dilated near the point, with a hook at the end, and a ridge from that to the base running along the middle; on the midway of the ridge rises a bony process, an inch and seven tenths high, three inches broad at the base, and only two tenths of an inch thick. In some are several les∣ser processes between this and the point: a vast naked membrana∣ceous pouch extends from the point of the lower mandible, widen∣ing gradually, and extending ten inches down the front of the neck: on the hind part of the head is a tuft of very narrow delicate fea∣thers, not very discernible, as they usually lie flat: the rest of the head and neck is covered with most exquisitely fine down, and very thick set: the rest of the plumage white, except the primaries and bastard wings, which are black: legs flesh-color. The largest of web-footed Water-Fowl. Some are superior in SIZE to a SWAN. One was killed off <HI>Majorca,</HI> which weighed twenty-five pounds. Their extent of wings from eleven to fifteen feet. Notwithstand∣ing their great bulk, they soar to a most surprising height. This is owing to the amazing lightness of the bones, which, all together, do not weigh a pound and a half. Add to this, the quantity of air with which its body is filled, which gives it a wonderful specific lightness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE>One of the birds from which this description was taken, was shot at <HI>Augusta</HI> in <HI>South Carolina,</HI> a hundred and fifty miles from the

sea. It agrees entirely with the Pelecan of the old continent, except in the bony processes on the bill. The other was sent, with other birds, from <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> to the Royal Society. Instead of the bony processes on the bill, was a tuft or fibrous fringe, sufficient to identify the species. This species extends over most parts of the torrid zone, and many parts of the warmer temperate. Is found in <HI>Europe</HI> on the lower parts of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and in all parts of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea, almost all <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>Asia Minor.</HI> Are seen in in∣credible numbers about the <HI>Black</HI> and <HI>Caspian</HI> seas; and come far up the rivers, and into the inland lakes of the <HI>Asiatic Russian</HI> em∣pire; but grow scarcer eastward, and are seldom met with so far north as the <HI>Sibirian</HI> lakes; yet are not unknown about that of <HI>Baikal.</HI> They are common on the coast of <HI>New Holland,</HI> where they grow to an enormous size<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cook's First Voy. <HI>iii. 627.</HI></NOTE>. They feed upon fish; which they take sometimes by plunging from a great height in the air, and seizing, like the GANNET: at other times, they fish in concert, swimming in flocks, and forming a large circle in the great rivers, which they gradually contract, beating the water with their wings and feet, in order to drive the fish into the center; which when they approach, they open their vast mouths, and fill their pouches with their prey, then incline their bills, to empty the bag of the water; after which they swim to shore, and eat their booty in quiet. As the pouch is capable of holding a dozen quarts of water, a guess may be made of the quantity of fishes it can contain. The <HI>French</HI> very properly call them <HI>Grand-gosiers,</HI> or <HI>Great-throats.</HI> It is said that when they make their nests in the dry deserts, they carry the water to their young in their vast pouches, and that the lions and beasts of prey come there to quench their thirst, sparing the young, the cause of this salutary provision. Possibly, on this account, the <HI>Egyptians</HI> style this bird the <HI>Camel of the River;</HI> the <HI>Persians, Tacab,</HI> or the <HI>Water-carrier.</HI></P>

wait for these birds, which are a favorite food of those animals. They lay in <HI>June.</HI> Their eggs are green, and of the size of those of a Hen. They are very bad tasted, and are not easily dressed; yet are so acceptable to the <HI>Kamtschatkans,</HI> that, at the hazard of their necks, they will climb to the most dangerous places in search of them, and often fall and lose their lives. They catch these birds with nets, in which they are entangled in the places where they rest. They are also caught in snares, with a running noose hung to the end of a pole, with which the fowlers creep quietly to∣wards the birds, and fling it round their necks, and draw them up the rock. The rest of the flock are so stupid, that, notwith∣standing they see the fate of their companions, they remain, shak∣ing their heads, on the same spot, till they are all taken. The flesh is excessively hard and sinewy. The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> cook it af∣ter their fashion, by putting the bird, without plucking or gutting, into a hole filled with fire: and when it is done enough, draw off the skin, and make on it a savory repast.</P>
<P>HAVING gone through the class of birds, let me remark, that there is the greatest probability, that numbers of those of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> are common to <HI>North America;</HI> and that they pass there the seasons of migration; but not having actual proof of their being found on the new continent, I am obliged to place them in these appendages to each genus. The time may come, when it will be found necessary to remove them into the <HI>American</HI> sections. It is also likely, that num∣bers may seek a more southern retreat, and stock <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>China</HI> with their periodical flocks. I have done as much as the lights of my days have furnished me with. In some remote age, when the <HI>British</HI> offspring will have pervaded the whole of their vast conti∣nent, or the descendants of the hardy <HI>Russians</HI> colonized the western parts from their distant <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> the road in future time to new

conquests: after, perhaps, bloody contests between the progeny of <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Russians,</HI> about countries to which neither have any right; after the deaths of thousands of clamants, and the extirpation of the poor natives by the sword, and new-imported diseases, a quiet settlement may take place, civilization ensue, and the arts of peace be cultivated: learning, the luxury of the soul, diffuse itself through the nation, and some naturalist arise, who, with spirit and abilities, may explore each boundary of the ocean which separates the <HI>Asiatic</HI> and <HI>American</HI> continents; may render certain what I can only suspect; and, by his observations on the feathered tribe, their flights and migrations, give utility to mankind, in naval and oeconomical operations, by auguries which the antients knew well to apply to the benefit of their fellow-creatures. He may, perhaps, smile on the labors of the <HI>Arctic</HI> Zoologist (if by that time they are not quite obsolete); and, as the animate creation never changes her course, he may find much right; and, if he is endowed with a good heart, will candidly attribute the errors to misinformation, or the common in∣firmity of human nature.</P>
