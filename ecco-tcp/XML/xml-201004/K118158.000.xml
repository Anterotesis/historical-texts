<P>THE COMPENDIOUS MEASURER; BEING A BRIEF, YET COMPREHENSIVE, TREATISE ON MENSURATION AND PRACTICAL GEOMETRY.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOME years since I published a complete Treatise on Mensuration, both in Theory and Practice; in which the Elements of that Science are demonstrated, and the Rules applied to the various practical pur∣poses of life. That work has been well received by the Public, and honoured with the high approbation of the more learned Mathematicians.</P>
<P>It has, however, been often represented to me, by Tutors and others, that the great size and price of that work, as well as the very scientific manner in which it is formed, prevent it from being so gene∣rally useful in schools, and to practical measurers, as a more compendious and familiar little book might be, which they could put into the hands of their pu∣pils, as a work containing all the practical rules of that art, in a form proper for them to copy from, and unmixed with such geometrical and algebraical de∣monstrations as occur in the large work.</P>
<P>In compliance, therefore, with such representations, I have drawn up this Compendium of Mensuration, Practical Geometry, and Arithmetic, expressly with the view of accommodating it to practical matters, and to the use of schools. I have, therefore, here brought together all the most useful rules and pre∣cepts; have arranged them in an orderly manner, proper for the pupil to copy; and delivered them in plain and familiar language. An example, worked out at full length, is set down to each rule, together with drawings or representations of the geometrical figures proper to illustrate each problem; and then are subjoined some more questions to each rule, as examples proposed for the practice of the learner, with
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>the answer set down, by which he may know when his work is right.</P>
<P>The introduction to Decimal and Duodecimal Arithmetic, will be found useful, by going over those branches before entering on the Mensuration, that the learner may be very ready and expert in numeral calculations.</P>
<P>The Practical Geometry contains a great num∣ber of geometrical constructions and operations; by the practice of which the learner will acquire the free and easy use of his instruments, and so become prepared for making the drawings that are useful for illustrating the various branches of mensuration fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>The Mensuration itself next succeeds, and is di∣vided into various parts; first, Mensuration in gene∣ral, and then as applied to the several practical uses in life. The whole being arranged in such order as the learner may properly take in succession; or distin∣guished into several branches, of which he may select and study any peculiar ones that may be more to his purpose than the rest, when he either has not leisure or inducement to go over the whole in a regular gra∣dation. And notwithstanding the compendious size of the book, and the great number of practical branches here treated, it will be found that each one is much more full and complete than the first appear∣ance of so small a form may promise to admit of. However, if farther satisfaction be desired by any one, either concerning the science in general, or the demonstrations of the rules, or the more curious and copious display of properties, he may apply to my large treatise before mentioned, where he will find every part delivered in the most ample form.</P>

<HEAD>DECIMAL FRACTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>A Decimal is a fraction whose denominator is an unit, or 1, with some number of ciphers an∣nexed; as 1/10 or 45/10000.</P>
<P>Decimals are written down without their denomi∣nators, the numerators being so distinguished as to shew what the denominators are; which is done, by separating, by a point, so many of the right-hand figures from the rest as there are ciphers in the deno∣minator; the figures on the left side of the point be∣ing integers, and those on the right decimals.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Thus, 0.5 is understood to be 5/10 or ½</ITEM>
<ITEM>And 0.25 is understood to be 25/100 or ¼</ITEM>
<ITEM>And 0.75 is understood to be 75/100 or ¾</ITEM>
<ITEM>And 1.3 is understood to be 13/10 or 1 3/10</ITEM>
<ITEM>And 24.6 is understood to be 24 6/10</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But when there is not a sufficient number of figures in the numerator, ciphers are prefixed to supply the defect.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
<ITEM>So, .02 is 2/100 or 1/50</ITEM>
<ITEM>And .0015 is 15/10000 or 3/2000</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>So that the denominator of a decimal is a 1, with as many ciphers as there are figures in the decimal.</P>
<P>A finite decimal, is that which ends at a certain number of places. But an infinite decimal, that which no where ends, but is understood to be indefinitely continued.</P>
<P>A repeating decimal, has one figure, or several figures continually repeated. As 20.2433 &amp;c. which is a single or simple repetend. And 20.2424 &amp;c. or 20.246246 &amp;c. which are compound re∣petends; and are otherwise called circulates, or cir∣culating decimals. A point is set over a single re∣petend, and a point over the first and last figures of a circulating decimal.</P>
<P>The first place, next after the decimal mark, is 10th parts, the second is 100th parts, the third is 1000th parts, and so on, decreasing towards the right by 10ths, or increasing towards the left by 10ths, the same as whole or integer numbers do. As in the following Scale of Notation</P>

<ITEM>And .500 or 500/1000 that is ½</ITEM>
</LIST> &amp;c. are all of equal value.</P>
<P>But ciphers before decimal figures, and after the separating point, diminish the value in a ten-fold proportion for every cipher.
<LIST>
<ITEM>So, .5 is 5/10 or ½</ITEM>
<ITEM>But .05 is 5/100 or 1/20</ITEM>
<ITEM>And .005 is 5/1000 or 1/200</ITEM>
</LIST> And so on.</P>
<P>So that, in any mixed or fractional number, if the separating point be moved
<LIST>
<ITEM>one, two, three, &amp;c. places to the right hand, every figure will be</ITEM>
<ITEM>10, 100, 1000, &amp;c. times greater than before.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But if the point be moved towards the left hand, then every figure will be diminished in the same manner, or the whole quantity will be divided by 10, 100, 1000, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITION OF DECIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>SET the numbers under each other according to the value of their places, as in whole numbers, or so that the decimal points stand directly below each other. Then add as in whole numbers, placing the decimal point in the sum straight below the other points.</P>

<P><HI>Note,</HI> When a great many figures are required in the decimal, and the denominator of the given fraction is a prime number greater than 11, the ope∣ration will be best performed as follows.</P>
<P>Suppose, for instance, I would find the reciprocal of the prime number 29, or the value of the frac∣tion 1/29 in decimal numbers. I divide 1.000 by 29, in the common way, so far as to find two or three of the first figures, or till the remainder becomes a single figure, and then I assume the supplement to complete the quotient. Thus I shall have 1/29=0.03448 8/29 for the complete quotient; which equa∣tion if I multiply by the numerator 8, it will give 8/29=0.27584 64/29 or rather 8/29=0.27586 6/29. I sub∣stitute this instead of the fraction in the first equa∣tion, and I shall have 1/29=0.0344827586 6/29. Again I multiply this equation by 6, and it will give 6/29=0.2068965517 7/29, and then by substitution 1/29=0.03448275862068965517 7/29. Again, I multiply this equation by 7, and it becomes 7/29=0.24137931034482758620 10/29, and then by substitu∣tion 1/29=0.03448275862068965517241379310344 82758620 10/29, where every operation will at least double the number of figures found by the preced∣ing operation.

<HEAD>RULE.</HEAD>
<P>Multiply the given number, or first power, con∣tinually by itself, till the number of multiplications be 1 less than the index of the power to be found, and the last product will be the power required.</P>
<P><HI>Note</HI> 1. Because fractions are multiplied by taking the products of their numerators and of their denominators, they will be involved by raising each of their terms to the power required. And if a mixt number be proposed, either reduce it to an im∣proper fraction, or reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal, and proceed by the rule.</P>
<P N="2">2. The raising of powers will be sometimes shor∣tened by working according to this observation, viz. whatever two or more powers are multiplied toge∣ther, their product is the power whose index is the sum of the indices of the factors; or if a power be multiplied by itself, the product will be the power whose index is double of that which is multiplied; so if I would find the sixth power, I might multiply the given number twice by itself for the third power,
<PB N="27" REF="38"/>then the third power into itself would give the sixth power; or if I would find the seventh power; I might first find the third and fourth, and their pro∣duct would be the seventh; or lastly, if I would find the eighth power, I might first find the second, then the second into itself would be the fourth, and this into itself would be the eighth.</P>

<HEAD>EVOLUTION; OR EXTRACTION OF ROOTS.</HEAD>
<P>The root of any given number, or power, is such a number, as being multiplied by itself a certain number of times, will produce the power; and it is denominated the first, second, third, fourth, &amp;c. root, respectively, as the number of multiplications made of it to produce the given power is 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. that is, the name of the root is taken from the number which exceeds the multiplications by 1, like the name of the power in involution.</P>
<P>The index of the root, like that of the power in involution, is 1 more than the number of the multi∣plications necessary to produce the power or given number. So 2 is the index of the second or square root; and 3 the index of the 3d or cubic root; and 4 the index of the 4th root; and so on.</P>
<P>Roots are sometimes denoted by writing √ before the power, with the index of the root against it: so the third root of 50 is 3√50, and the second root of it is √50, the index 2 being omitted, which index is always understood when a root is named or written without one, but if the power be expressed by several numbers with the sign + or −, &amp;c. between them, then a line is drawn from the top of the sign of the root or radical sign, over all the parts of it; so the third root of 47−15 is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and sometimes roots are designed like powers, with the reciprocal or
<PB N="30" REF="41"/>the index of the root above the given number.

<P>A number is called a complete power of any kind, when its root of the same kind can be accu∣rately extracted; but if not, the number is called an imperfect power, and its root a surd or irrational quantity. So 4 is a complete power of the second kind, its root being 2; but an imperfect power of the third kind, its third root being a surd quantity, which cannot be accurately extracted.</P>
<P>Evolution is the finding of the roots of numbers, either accurately, or in decimals to any proposed de∣gree of accuracy.</P>
<P>The power is first to be prepared for extraction, or evolution, by dividing it, by means of points or commas, from the place of units, to the left hand in integers, and to the right in decimal fractions, into periods, containing each as many places of figures as are denoted by the index of the root, if the power contain a complete number of such periods; that is each period to have two figures for the square root, three for the cube root, four for the fourth root, and so on. And when the last period in decimals is not complete, ciphers are added to compleat it.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> The root will contain just as many places of figures as there are periods or points in
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>the given power; and they will be integers, or de∣cimals respectively, as the periods are so from which they are found, or to which they correspond; that is, there will be as many integer or decimal figures in the root, as there are periods of integers or deci∣mals in the given number.</P>

<P><HI>Note.</HI> Instead of doubling the root to find the new divisors, you may add the last divisor to the figure below it.</P>
<P>To prove the work, multiply the root by itself, and to the product add the remainder, and the sum will be the given number.</P>
<P>Ex. 1. To extract the root of 17.3056.</P>
<P>Having divided the given number into three periods, namely 17, and 30, and 56, I find that 16 is the next square to 17, the first period, which set below, and sub∣tracting, 1 remains, to which bring down 30, the next pe∣riod, makes 130 for a divi∣dend. Then 4, the root of
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></NOTE> 16, is set on the right of the given number for the first figure of the root, and its double, or 8, on the left of the dividend for the first figure of the divisor; which being once contained in 13, the dividend wanting its last figure, gives 1 for the next figure of the root, which 1 is accordingly set in the root, making 4.1, and in the divisor, making 81, as also below the same. These multiplied make also 81, set below the dividend, and subtracting, we have 49 remaining, to which the last period 56 being brought down, we have 4956 for the new dividend. Then, for a new divisor, either double the root 4.1, or else, which is easier, to the last divisor add the figure 1 standing below it, and either way gives
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>82 for the first part of the new divisor. This 82 is 6 times contained in 495, and therefore 6 is the next figure, to set in the root and in the divisor, as also below the same; which being then multiplied by it, gives 4956, the same as the dividend; there∣fore nothing remains, and 4.16, is the root of 17.3056, as required.</P>

And when the root is to be ex∣tracted to a great number of places, the work may be much abbreviated thus: having proceeded in the extraction after the common method till you have found one more than half the required number of figures in the root, the rest may be found by divid∣ing the last remainder by its corresponding divisor, annexing a cipher to every dividual, as in division of decimals; or rather, without annexing ciphers, by omitting continually the right-hand figure of the divisor, after the manner of the third contraction in division of decimals in page 10.</P>

<HEAD>TO FIND TWO MEAN PROPORTIONALS.</HEAD>
<P>There are many uses of the cube root; one is to find two mean proportionals between two given numbers, which is performed thus:</P>
<P>Divide the greater extreme by the less, and the cube root of the quotient multiplied by the less extreme, gives the less mean. Multiply the said cube root by the less mean, and the product is the greater mean proportional.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> This is only understood of those numbers that are in continued geometric proportion.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE. I.</P>
<P>What are the two mean proportionals between 4 and 108?</P>
<P>108 divided by 4 gives 27, whose cube root is 3; and the less extreme 4, multiplied thereby, gives 12 for the less mean; and 12 multiplied by the said root 3, gives 36 for the greater mean.</P>

<P>Draw any line as AB of any convenient length. Divide it into 11 equal parts

Divide the altitude into 10 equal parts, if it be for a decimal scale for common numbers, or into 12 equal parts, if it be for feet and inches; and through these points of division draw as many parallel lines, the whole length of the scale.— Then divide the length of the first division AC into 10 equal parts, both above and below; and connect these points of division by diagonal lines, and the scale is finished, after being numbered as you please.</P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> These diagonal scales serve to take off dimen∣sions or numbers of three figures. If the first large di∣visions be units; the second set of divisions along AC, will be 10th parts; and the divisions in the altitude, along AD, will be 100th parts.

Hence the axis of a pyramid, is the line from the vertex to the middle of the base, or the end on which it is supposed to stand. And the axis of a sphere, is the same as a diameter, or a line passing through the center, and terminated by the surface on both sides.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE CARPENTER's RULE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS instrument is otherwise called the sliding rule; and it is much used in timber measuring and artificers works, both for taking the dimensions, and casting up the contents.</P>
<P>The instrument consists of two equal pieces, each a foot in length, which are connected together by a folding joint.</P>
<P>One side or face of the rule, is divided into inches, and half-quarters, or eighths. On the same face also are several plane scales, divided into twelfth parts by diagonal lines; which are used in planning dimensions that are taken in feet and inches. The edge of the rule is commonly divided decimally, or into tenths; namely each foot into 10 equal parts, and each of these into 10 parts again: so that by means of this last scale, dimensions are taken in feet and tenths and hundredths, and multiplied as common decimal numbers, which is the best way.</P>
<P>On the one part of the other face are four lines, marked A, B, C, D, the two middle ones B and C being on a slider, which runs in a groove made in the stock. The same numbers serve for both these two middle lines, the one being above the numbers, and the other below.</P>
<P>These four lines are logarithmic ones, and the three A, B, C, which are all equal to one another, are double
<PB N="150" REF="162"/>lines, as they proceed twice over from 1 to 10. The other or lowest line D, is a single one, proceeding from 4 to 40. It is also called the girt line, from its use in casting up the contents of trees and timber; and upon it are marked WG at 17.15, and AG at 18.95, the wine and ale gage points, to make this instrument serve the purpose of a gaging rule.</P>
<P>Upon the other part of this face there is a table of the value of a load, or 50 cubic feet, of timber, at all prices, from 6 pence to 2 shillings a foot.</P>
<P>When 1 at the beginning of any line is accounted 1, then the 1 in the middle will be 10, and the 10 at the end 100; and when 1 at the beginning is accounted 10, then the 1 in the middle is 100, and the 10 at the end 1000; and so on. And all the smaller divisions are altered proportionally.</P>

<HEAD>ARTIFICERS WORK.</HEAD>
<P>ARTIFICERS compute the contents of their works by several different measures.</P>
<P>As glazing and masonry by the foot.</P>
<P>Painting, plastering, paving, &amp;c. by the yard, of 9 square feet.</P>
<P>Flooring, partitioning, roofing, tiling, &amp;c. by the square, of 100 square feet.</P>
<P>And brickwork either by the yard of 9 square feet, or by the perch, or square, rod or pole, containing 272¼ square feet, or 30¼ square yards, being the square of the rod or pole of 16½ feet or 5½ yards long.</P>
<P>As this number 272¼ is a troublesome number to di∣vide by, the ¼ is often omitted in practice, and the con∣tent in feet divided only by the 272. But as this is not exact, it will be both better and easier to multiply the feet by 4, and then divide successively by 9, 11, and 11. Also to divide square yards by 30¼, first multiply them by 4, and then divide twice by 11.</P>
<P>All works, whether superficial or solid, are computed by the rules proper to the figure of them, whether it be a triangle, or rectangle, a parallelopiped, or any other figure.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB REF="173"/>
<HEAD>BRICKLAYERS WORK.</HEAD>
<P>BRICKWORK is estimated at the rate of a brick and a half thick; and if a wall be more or less than this standard thickness, it must be reduced to it, as follows:</P>
<P>Multiply the superficial content of the wall by the number of half bricks in the thickness, and divide the product by 3.</P>
<P>The dimensions of a building are usually taken by measuring half round on the outside, and half round it on the inside; the sum of these two gives the compass of the wall, to be multiplied by the height for the con∣tent of the materials.</P>
<P>Chimneys are by some measured as if they were solid, deducting only the vacuity from the hearth to the mantle, on account of the trouble of them.</P>
<P>And by others they are girt or measured round for their breadth, and the height of the story is their height, taking the depth of the jambs for their thickness. And in this case no reduction is made for the vacuity from the floor to the mantle tree, because of the gathering of the breast and wings, to make room for the hearth in the next story.</P>
<P>To measure the chimney shafts, which appear above the building; girt them about with a line for the breadth, to multiply by their height. And account their thick∣ness half a brick more than it really is, in considera∣tion of the plastering and scaffolding.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="174"/>All windows, doors, &amp;c. are to be deducted out of the contents of the walls in which they are placed. But this deduction is made only with regard to mate∣rials; for the whole measure is taken for workmanship, and that all outside measure too, namely, measuring quite round the outside of the building, being in consi∣deration of the trouble of the returns or angles. They have also some other allowances, such as double mea∣sure for feathered gable ends, &amp;c.</P>

<P>TO masonry belongs all sorts of stone work; and the measure made use of is a foot, either superfi∣cial or solid.</P>
<P>Walls, columns, blocks of stone or marble, &amp;c. are measured by the cubic foot; and pavements, slabs, chimney-pieces, &amp;c. by the superficial or square foot.</P>
<P>Cubic or solid measure is used for the materials, and square measure for the workmanship.</P>
<P>In the solid measure, the true length, breadth, and thickness, are taken, and multiplied continually toge∣ther. In the superficial, there must be taken the length and breadth of every part of the projection, which is seen without the general upright face of the building.</P>

<HEAD>CARPENTERS AND JOINERS WORK.</HEAD>
<P>TO this branch belongs all the wood-work of a house, such as flooring, partitioning, roofing, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> Large and plain articles are usually measured by the square foot or yard, &amp;c. but inriched mouldings, and some other articles, are often estimated by running or lineal measure, and some things are rated by the piece.</P>
<P>In measuring of joists, it is to be observed, that only one of their dimensions is the same with that of the floor; and the other will exceed the length of the room by the thickness of the wall, and ⅓ of the same, because each end is let into the wall about ⅔ of its thickness.</P>
<P>No deductions are made for hearths, on account of the additional trouble and waste of materials.</P>
<P><HI>Partitions</HI> are measured from wall to wall for one di∣mension, and from floor to floor, as far as they extend, for the other.</P>
<P>No deduction is made for door-ways, on account of the trouble of framing them.</P>
<P>In measuring of joiners work, the string is made to ply close to every part of the work over which it passes.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="179"/><HI>The measure of centering for cellars</HI> is found by mak∣ing a string pass over the surface of the arch for the breadth, and taking the length of the cellar for the length; but in groin-centering, it is usual to allow double measure, on account of their extraordinary trouble.</P>
<P><HI>In roofing,</HI> the length of the house in the inside, to∣gether with ⅔ of the thickness of one gable, is to be considered as the length; and the breadth is equal to double the length of a string which is stretched from the ridge down the rafter, and along the eaves-board; till it meets with the top of the wall.</P>
<P><HI>For stair-cases,</HI> take the breadth of all the steps, by making a line ply close over them, from the top to the bottom, and multiply the length of this line by the length of a step for the whole area.—By the length of a step is meant the length of the front and the returns at the two ends, and by the breadth is to be understood the girt of its two upper surfaces, or the tread and riser.</P>
<P><HI>For the balustrade,</HI> take the whole length of the up∣per part of the hand-rail, and girt over its end till it meet the top of the newel post, for the length; and twice the length of the baluster upon the landing, with the girt of the hand-rail, for the breadth.</P>
<P><HI>For wainscotting,</HI> take the compass of the room for the length; and the height from the floor to the cieling, making the string ply close into all the mouldings, for the breadth.—Out of this must be made deductions for windows, doors, and chimneys, &amp;c. but workmanship is counted for the whole, on account of the extraordi∣nary trouble.</P>
<P><HI>For doors,</HI> it is usual to allow for their thickness, by adding it into both the dimensions of length and breadth, and then multiply them together for the area.—If the door be pannelled on both sides, take double its measure for the workmanship; but if one side only be pannelled, take the area and its half for the workmanship.—<HI>For the surrounding architrave,</HI> gird it about the outermost part
<PB N="168" REF="180"/>for its length; and measure over it, as far as it can be seen when the door is open, for the breadth.</P>
<P><HI>Window-shutters, bases,</HI> &amp;c. are measured in the same manner.</P>
<P>In the measuring of roofing for workmanship alone, all holes for chimney shafts and sky-lights are generally deducted.</P>
<P>But in measuring for work and materials, they com∣monly measure in all sky-lights, luthern-lights, and holes for the chimney shafts, on account of their trouble and waste of materials.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER 1. <HI>Description and Use of the Instruments.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>1. OF THE CHAIN.</HEAD>
<P>LAND is measured with a chain, called Gunter's chain, of 4 poles or 22 yards in length, which con∣sists of 100 equal links, each link being 22/100 of a yard or 66/100 of a foot, or 7.92 inches long, that is, nearly 8 inches or ⅔ of a foot.</P>
<P>An acre of land, is equal to 10 square chains, that is, 10 chains in length and 1 chain in breadth. Or it is 220 x 22 or 4840 square yards. Or it is 40 x 4 or 160 square poles. Or it is 1000 x 100 or 100000 square links. These being all the same quantity.</P>
<P>Also, an acre is divided into 4 parts called roods, and a rood into 40 parts called perches, which are square poles, or the square of a pole of 5¼ yards long, or the square of ¼ of a chain, or of 25 links, which is 625 square links. So that the divisions of land measure will be thus:</P>
<P><LIST>
<ITEM>625 sq. links=1 pole or perch</ITEM>
<ITEM>40 perches=1 rood</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 roods=1 acre</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="198"/>The length of lines, measured with a chain, are set down in links as integers, every chain in length being 100 links; and not in chains and decimals. Therefore after the content is found, it will be in square links; then cut off five of the figures on the right-hand for decimals, and the rest will be acres Those decimals are then multiplied by 4 for roods, and the decimals of these again by 40 for perches.</P>

<HEAD>2. OF THE PLAIN TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>This instrument consists of a plain rectangular board of any convenient size, the center of which, when used, is fixed by means of screws to a three-legged stand, hav∣ing a ball and socket, or joint, at the top, by means of which, when the logs are fixed on the ground, the table is inclined in any direction.</P>
<P>To the table belongs,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="187" REF="199"/>1. A frame of wood, made to fit round its edges, and to be taken off, for the convenience of putting a sheet of paper upon the table. The one side of this frame is usually divided into equal parts, for drawing lines across the table, parallel or perpendicular to the sides; and the other side of the frame is divided into 360 degrees from a center which is in the middle of the table; by means of which the table is to be used as a theodo∣lite, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. A needle and compass screwed into the side of the table, to point out the directions, and to be a check upon the sights.</P>
<P N="3">3. An index, which is a brass two-foot scale, with either a small telescope, or open sights erected perpendi∣cularly upon the ends. These sights, and one edge of the index are in the same plane, and that edge is called the fiducial edge of the index.</P>
<P>Before you use this instrument, take a sheet of paper which will cover it, and wet it to make it expand; then spread it flat upon the table, pressing down the frame upon the edges, to stretch it and keep it fixed there; and when the paper is become dry, it will, by con∣tracting again, stretch itself smooth and flat from any cramps or unevenness. Upon this paper is to be drawn the plan or form of the thing measured.</P>
<P>In using this instrument, begin at any part of the ground you think the most proper, and make a point upon a convenient part of the paper or table, to repre∣sent that point of the ground; then six in that point one leg of the compasses, or a fine steel pin, and apply to it the fiducial edge of the index, moving it round till through the sights you perceive some remarkable object, as the corner of a field, &amp;c. and from the station point draw a line with the point of the compasses along the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iducial edge of the index; then set another object or corner, and draw its line; do the same by another, and so on till as many objects are set as may be thought necessary. Then measure from your station towards
<PB N="188" REF="200"/>as many of the objects as may be necessary, and no more, taking the requisite offsets to corners or crooks in the hedges, &amp;c and lay the measures down upon their respective lines upon the table. Then, at any conve∣nient place, measured to, fix the table in the same po∣sition, and set the objects which appear from thence, &amp;c. as before; and thus continue till your work is fi∣nished, measuring such lines as are necessary, and de∣termining as many as you can by intersecting lines of direction drawn from different stations.</P>
<P>And in these operations observe the following parti∣cular cautions and directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let the lines upon which you make starions be directed towards objects as far distant as possible; and when you have set any such object, go round the table and look through the sights from the other end of the index, to see if any other remarkable object lie directly opposite; if there be not such an one, endeavour to find another forward object, such as shall have a remark∣able backward opposite one, and make use of it rather than the other; because the back object will be of use in fixing the table in the original position either when you have measured too near to the forward object, or when it may be hid from your sight at any necessary station by intervening hedges, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let the said lines, upon which the stations are taken, be pursued as far as you conveniently can; for that will be the means of preserving more accuracy in the work.</P>
<P N="3">3. At each station it will be necessary to prove the truth of it; that is, whether the table be straight in the line towards the object, and also whether the dis∣tance be rightly measured and laid down on the paper.— To know if the table be set down straight in the line; lay the index upon the table in any manner, and more the table about till through the sights you perceive either the fore or back object; then, without moving the table, go round it and look through the sights by
<PB N="189" REF="201"/>the other end of the index, to see if the other object can be perceived; if it be, the table is in the line; if not, it must be shifted to one side, according to your judgment, till through the sights both objects can be seen.—The aforesaid operation only informs you if the station be straight in the line; but to know if it be in the right part of the line, that is, if the distance has been rightly laid down; fix the table in the original position, by laying the index along the station line and turning the table about till the fore and back objects appear through the sights, and then also will the needle point at the same degree as at first; then lay the index over the station point and any other point on the paper representing an object which can be seen from the station; and if the said object appear straight through the sights, the station may be depended on as right; if not, the distance should be examined and corrected till the object can be so seen. And for this very useful purpose, it is adviseable to have some high object or two, which can be seen from the greatest part of the ground, accurately laid down on the paper from the beginning of the survey, to serve continually as proof objects.</P>
<P>When, from any station, the fore and back objects cannot both be seen, the agreement of the needle with one of them may be depended on for placing the table straight on the line, and for fixing it in the original position.</P>
<P><HI>Of shifting the Paper on the Plain Table.</HI></P>
<P>When one paper is full, and you have occasion for more; draw a line in any manner through the farthest point of the last station line, to which the work can be conveniently laid down; then take the sheet off the table, and fix another on, drawing a line upon it, in a part the most convenient for the rest of the work; then sold or cut the old sheet by the line drawn on it, apply the edge to the line on the new sheet, and, as they lie in that position, continue the last station line upon the new paper, placing upon it the rest of the measure, be∣ginning
<PB N="190" REF="202"/>at where the old sheet left off. And so on from sheet to sheet.</P>
<P>When the work is done, and you would fasten all the sheets together into one piece, or rough plan, the afore∣said lines are to be accurately joined together, as when the lines were transferred from the old sheets to the new ones.</P>
<P>But it is to be noted, that if the said joining lines, upon the old and new sheet, have not the same inclina∣tion to the side of the table, the needle will not point to the original degree when the table is rectified; and if the needle be required to respect still the same degree of the compass, the easiest way of drawing the lines in the same position, is to draw them both parallel to the same sides of the table, by means of the equal divisions mark∣ed on the other two sides.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>3. OF THE THEODOLITE.</HEAD>
<P>The theodolite is a brazen circular ring, divided in∣to 360 degrees, and having an index with sights, or a telescope, placed upon the center, about which the in∣dex is moveable; also a compass fixed to the center, to point out courses and check the sights; the whole be∣ing fixed by the center upon a stand of a convenient height for use.</P>
<P>In using this instrument, an exact account, or field-book, of all measures and things necessary to be re∣marked in the plan, must be kept, from which to make out the plan upon your return home from the ground.</P>
<P>Begin at such part of the ground, and measure in such directions, as you judge most convenient; taking angles or directions to objects, and measuring such distances as appear necessary, under the same restrictions as in the use of the plain table. And it is safest to six the theodolite in the original position at every station by means of fore and back objects, and the compass, ex∣actly as in using the plain table; registering the num∣ber of degrees cut off by the index when directed to
<PB N="191" REF="203"/>each object; and, at any station, placing the index at the same degree as when the direction towards that sta∣tion was taken from the last preceding one, to fix the theodolite there in the original position, after the same manner as the plain table is fixed in the original posi∣tion, by laying its index along the line of the last di∣rection.</P>
<P>The best method of laying down the aforesaid lines of direction, is to describe a pretty large circle, quarter it, and lay upon it the several numbers of degrees cut off by the index in each direction; then, by means of a parallel ruler, draw, from station to station, lines parallel to lines drawn from the center to the respective points in the circumference.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>4. OF THE CROSS.</HEAD>
<P>The cross consists of two pair of sights set at right angles to each other, upon a staff having a sharp point at the bottom to stick in the ground.</P>
<P>The cross is very useful to measure small and crooked pieces of ground. The method is to measure a base or chief line, usually in the longest direction of the piece from corner to corner; and while measuring it, finding the places where perpendiculars would fall up∣on this line from the several corners and bends in the boundary of the piece, with the cross, by fixing it, by trials, upon such parts of the line as that through one pair of the sights both ends of the line may appear, and through the other pair you can perceive the correspond∣ing bends or corners; and then measuring the lengths of the said perpendiculars.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the fore-mentioned instruments, which are most commonly used, there are some others; as the circumferentor, which resembles the theodolite in shape and use; and the semi-circle, for taking angles, &amp;c. But of all the instruments for measuring, the plain table is
<PB N="192" REF="204"/>certainly the best; not only because it may be used as a theodolite or semi-circle, by turning uppermost that side of the frame which has the 360 degrees upon it; but because it is, in its own proper use, by much the easiest, safest, and most accurate for the purpose; for by planning every part immediately upon the spot, as soon as measured, there is not only saved a great deal of writing in the field-book, but every thing can also be planned more easily and accurately while it is in view, than it can afterwards from a field-book, in which many little things must be either neglected or mistaken; and besides, the opportunities which the plain table afford of correcting your work, or proving if it be right, at every station, are such advantages as can never be balanced by any other method. But although the plain table be the most generally useful instrument, it is not <HI>always</HI> so; there being many cases in which sometimes one instrument is the properest, and some∣times another; nor is that surveyor master of his bu∣siness who cannot in any case distinguish which is the fittest instrument or method, and use it accordingly: nay sometimes no instrument at all, but barely the chain itself, is the best method, particularly in regular open fields lying together; and even when you are using the plain table, it is often of advantage to measure such large open parts with the chain only, and from those measures lay them down upon the table.</P>
<P>The perambulator is used for measuring roads, and other great distances on level ground, and by the sides of rivers. It has a wheel of 8¼ feet, or half a pole, in circumference, upon which the machine turns; and the distance measured, is pointed out by an index, which is moved round by clock work.</P>
<P>Levels, with telescople or other sights, are used to find the level between place and place, or how much one place is higher or lower than another.</P>
<P>An offset-staff is a very useful and necessary instru∣ment, for measuring the offsets and other short distances.
<PB N="193" REF="205"/>It is 10 links in length, being divided and marked at each of the 10 links.</P>
<P>Ten small arrows, or rods of iron or wood, are used to mark the end of every chain length, in measuring lines. And sometimes pickets, or staves with flags, are set up as marks or objects of direction.</P>
<P>Various scales are also used in protracting and mea∣suring on the plan or paper; such as plane scales, line of chords, protractor, compasses, reducing scale, pa∣rallel and perpendicular rules, &amp;c. Of plane scales, there should be several sizes, as a chain in 1 inch, a chain in ¾ of an inch, a chain in ½ an inch, &amp;c. And of these, the best for use, are those that are laid on the very edges of the ivory scale, to prick off distances by, without compasses.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE FIELD BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>In surveying with the plain table, a field-book is not used, as every thing is drawn on the table immediately when it is measured. But in surveying with the theo∣dolite, or any other instrument, some sort of a field-book must be used, to write down in it a register or ac∣count of all that is done and occurs relative to the survey in hand.</P>
<P>This book every one contrives and rules as he thinks fittest for himself. The following is a specimen of a form very generally used. It is ruled into 3 columns: the middle, or principal column, is for the stations, angles, bearings, distances measured, &amp;c; and those on the right and left are for the offsets on the right and left, which are set against their corresponding distances in the middle column; as also for such remarks as may oc∣cur, and be proper to note in drawing the plan, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here ☉ 1 is the first station, where the angle or bear∣ing is 105° 25′. On the left, at 73 links in the distance or principal line, is an offset of 92; and at 610 an offset of 24 to a cross hedge. On the right, at o, or the beginning, an offset 25 to the corner of the field; at 248 Brown's boundary hedge commences; at 610
<PB N="194" REF="206"/>an offset 35; and at 954, the end of the first line, the o denotes its terminating in the hedge. And so on for the other stations.</P>
<P>Draw a line under the work, at the end of every sta∣tion line, to prevent confusion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. THE PRACTICE OF SURVEYING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS part contains the several works proper to be done in the field, or the ways of measuring by all the instruments, and in all situations.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROBLEM I. <HI>To Measure a Line or Distance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To measure a line on the ground with the chain: Having provided a chain, with 10 small arrows, or rods, to stick one into the ground, as a mark, at the end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every chain; two persons take hold of the chain, one at each end of it, and all the 10 arrows are taken by one of them, who is to go foremost, and is called the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der; the other being called the follower, for distinc∣tion's sake.</P>
<P>A picket, or station-staff, being set up in the direction of the line to be measured, if there do not appear some marks naturally in that direction; the follower stands at the beginning of the line, holding the ring at the end of the chain in his hand, while the leader drags for∣ward
<PB N="196" REF="208"/>the chain by the other end of it, till it is stretched straight, and laid or held level, and the leader directed, by the follower waving his hand, to the right or left, till the follower see him exactly in a line with the mark or direction to be measured to; there both of them stretch∣ing the chain straight, and stooping and holding it le∣vel, the leader having the head of one of his arrows in the same hand by which he holds the end of the chain, let him there stick one of them down with it while he holds the chain stretched. This done, he leaves the arrow in the ground, as a mark for the fol∣lower to come to, and advances another chain forward, being directed in his position by the follower, standing at the arrow, as before; as also by himself now, and at every succeeding chain's length, by moving himself from side to side, till he brings the follower and the back mark into a line. Having then stretched the chain, and stuck down an arrow, as before, the fol∣lower takes up his arrow, and they advance again in the same manner another chain-length. And thus they proceed till all the 10 arrows are employed, and are in the hands of the follower; and the leader, without an arrow, is arrived at the end of the 11th chain length. The follower then sends or brings the 10 arrows to the leader, who puts one of them down at the end of his chain, and advances with the chain as before. And thus the arrows are changed from the one to the other at every 10 chains length, till the whole line is finished; when the number of changes of the arrows shews the number of tens, to which the follower adds the arrows he holds in his hand, and the number of links of an other chain over to the mark or end of the line. So if there have been 3 changes of the arrows, and the fol∣lower hold 6 arrows, and the end of the line cut off 45 links more, the whole length of the line is set down in links thus 3645.</P>

<P>The table being covered with a paper, and fixed on its stand; plant it at the station A, and fix a sine p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, or a point of the compasses in a proper point of the paper, to represent the point A: Close by the side of this pin lay the fiducial edge of the index, and turn it about, still touching the pin, till one object B can be seen through the sights: then by the fiducial edge of the index draw a line. In the very same manner draw another line in the direction of the other object C. And it is done.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>With the Theodolite, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Direct the fixed sights along one of the lines, as AB, by turning the instrument about till you see the mark B through these sights; and there screw the instrument fast. Then turn the moveable index about till, through its sights, you see the other mark C. Then the degrees cut by the index, upon the graduated limb or ring of the instrument, shews the quantity of the angle.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>With the Magnetic Needle and Compass.</HI></P>
<P>Turn the instrument, or compass, so, that the north end of the needle point to the flower-de-luce. Then direct the sights to one mark as B, and note the degrees cut by the needle. Then direct the sights to the other mark C, and note again the degrees cut by the needle. Then their sum or difference, as the case is, will give the quantity of the angle BAC.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="198" REF="210"/>4. <HI>By Measurement with the Chain, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Measure one chain length, or any other length, along both directions, as to b and c. Then measure the distance bc, and it is done.—This is easily trans∣ferred to paper, by making a triangle Abc with these three lengths, and then measuring the angle A as in Practical Geometry, prob. XI.</P>

<PB N="199" REF="211"/>find their positions by the cross, or by the instrument which you happen to be using, in this manner: As you measure along AB, when you come about C, where you judge a perpendicular will stand, plant your instrument in the line, and turn the index till the marks A and B can be seen through both the sights, looking both back∣ward and forward; then look along the cross sights, or the cross line on the index; and if it point directly to the corner or bend h, the place of C is right. Otherwise, move the instrument backward or forward on the line AB, till the cross line points straight to h. This being found, set down the distance measured from A to C; then measure the offset ch, and set it down opposite the former, and on the left hand side.</P>

<P>Having set up marks at the corners, where necessary, of the proposed field ABCDEFG. Walk over the ground, and consider how it can best be divided into triangles and trapeziums; and measure them separately as in the last two problems. And in this way it will be proper to divide it into as few separate triangles, and as many trapeziums as may be, by drawing diagonals from cor∣ner to corner; and so as that all the perpendiculars may fall within the figure. Thus, the following figure is divided into the two trapeziums ABCG, GDEF, and the triangle GCD. Then, in the first, beginning at A, measure the diagonal AC, and the two perpendiculars Gm, Bn. Then the base GC, and the perpendicular Dq. Lastly the diagonal DF, and the two perpendicu∣lars PE, OG. All which measures write against the corresponding parts of a rough figure drawn to resemble the figure to be surveyed, or set them down in any other form you choose.</P>

<P>Many pieces of land may be very well surveyed, by measuring any base line, either within or without them, together with the perpendiculars let fall upon it from every corner of them.

<P>In pieces that are not very large, it will be sufficiently exact to find the points, in the base line, where the se∣veral perpendiculars will fall, by means of the <HI>cross,</HI> and from thence measuring to the corners for the lengths of the perpendiculars.—And it will be most convenient to draw the line so as that all the perpendi∣culars may fall within the figure.</P>

Apply the index to A, turning it till you can see the point E, there draw a line; and then the point B, and there draw a line: then measure these lines, and lay them down from A to E and B. Next, move the table to B, lay the index along the line AB, and turn the table about till you can see the mark A, and screw fast the table; in which position also the needle will again point to the flower-de-luce, as it will

Turn it then again into its proper position, and in like manner find the next line CD. And so on quite round by E to A again. Then the proof of the work will be the joining at A: for if the work is all right, the last direction EA on the ground, will pass exactly through the point A on the paper; and the measured distance will also reach exactly to A.

<HEAD>PROBLEM XI. <HI>To Survey a Large Estate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>If the estate be very large, and contain a great num∣ber of fields, it cannot well be done by surveying all the fields singly, and then putting them together; nor can it be done by taking all the angles and boundaries that inclose it. For in these cases, any small errors will be so multiplied, as to render it very much dis∣torted.</P>
<P N="1">1. Walk over the estate two or three times, in order to get a perfect idea of it, and till you can carry the map of it tolerably in your head. And to help your me∣mory, draw an eye draught of it on paper, or at least, of the principal parts of it, to guide you.</P>
<P N="2">2. Choose two or more eminent places in the estate, for your stations, from whence you can see all the prin∣cipal parts of it: and let these stations be as far distant from one another as possible; as the fewer stations you have to command the whole, the more exact your work will be: and they will be sitter for your purpose, if these station lines be in or near the boundaries of the ground, and especially if two lines or more proceed from one station.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="211" REF="223"/>3. Take what angles, between the stations, you think necessary, and measure the distances from station to station, always in a right line: these things must be done, till you get as many angles and lines as are suffi∣cient for determining all your points of station. And in measuring any of these station distances, mark accu∣rately where these lines meet with any hedges, ditches, roads, lanes, paths, rivulets, &amp;c. and where any re∣markable object is placed, by measuring its distance from the station line; and where a perpendicular from it cuts that line; and always mind, in any of these ob∣servations, that you be in a right line, which you will know by taking backsight and foresight, along your sta∣tion line. And thus as you go along any main station line, take offsets to the ends of all hedges, and to any pond, house, mill, bridge, &amp;c. omitting nothing that is remarkable. And all these things must be noted down: for these are your data, by which the places of such objects are to be determined upon your plan. And be sure to set marks up at the intersections of all hedges with the station line, that you may know where to measure from, when you come to survey these particular fields, which must immediately be done, as soon as you have measured that station line, whilst they are fresh in memory. By this means all your station lines are to be measured, and the situation of all places adjoining to them determined, which is the first grand point to be ob∣tained. It will be proper for you to lay down your work upon paper every night, when you go home, that you may see how you go on.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the inner parts of the estate, they must be de∣termined in like manner, by new station lines: for, after the main stations are determined, and every thing ad∣joining to them, then the estate must be subdivided into two or three parts by new station lines; taking inner stations at proper places, where you can have the best view. Measure these station lines as you did the first, and all their intersections with hedges, and all offsets to such objects as appear. Then you may proceed to
<PB N="212" REF="224"/>survey the adjoining fields, by taking the angles that the sides make with the station line, at the intersections, and measuring the distances to each corner, from the in∣tersections. For every station line will be a basis to all the future operations; the situation of all parts being entirely dependent upon them; and therefore they should be taken as long as possible; and it is best for them to run along some of the hedges or boundaries of one or more fields, or to pass through some of their angles. All things being determined for these stations, you must take more inner stations, and continue to di∣vide and subdivide till at last you come to single fields; repeating the same work for the inner stations, as for the outer ones, till all be done; and close the work as often as you can, and in as few lines as possible. And that you may choose stations the most conveniently, so as to cause the least labour, let the station lines run as far as you can along some hedges, and through as many corners of the fields, and other remarkable points, as you can. And take notice how one field lies by ano∣ther; that you may not misplace them in the draught.</P>
<P N="5">5. An estate may be so situated, that the whole can∣not be surveyed together; because one part of the estate cannot be seen from another. In this case, you may di∣vide it into three or four parts, and survey the parts se∣parately, as if they were lands belonging to different persons; and at last join them together.</P>
<P N="6">6. As it is necessary to protract or lay down your work as you proceed in it, you must have a scale of a due length to do it by. To get such a scale, you must measure the whole length of the estate in chains; then you must consider how many inches long the map is to be; and from these you will know how many chains you must have in an inch; then make your scale, or choose one already made, accordingly.</P>
<P N="7">7. The trees in every hedge row must be placed in their proper situation, which is soon done by the plain table; but may be done by the eye without an instru∣ment; and being thus taken by guess, in a rough
<PB N="213" REF="225"/>draught, they will be exact enough, being only to look at; except it be such as are at any remarkable places, as at the ends of hedges, at stiles, gates, &amp;c. and these must be measured. But all this need not be done till the draught is finished. And observe in all the hedges, what side the gutter or ditch is on, and to whom the fences belong.</P>
<P N="8">8. When you have long stations, you ought to have a good instrument to take angles with, and the plain table may very properly be made use of, to take the se∣veral small internal parts, and such as cannot be taken from the main stations: as it is a very quick and ready instrument.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROBLEM XII. <HI>To Survey a County, or Large Tract of Land.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Choose two, three, or four eminent places for sta∣tions; such as the tops of high hills or mountains, towers, or church steeples, which may be seen from one another; and from which most of the towns, and other places of note, may also be seen. And let them be as far distant from one another as possible. Upon these places raise beacons, or long poles, with flags of different colours flying at them; so as to be visible from all the other stations.</P>
<P N="2">2. At all the places, which you would set down in the map, plant long poles with flags at them of several colours, to distinguish the places from one another; fixing them upon the tops of church steeples, or the tops of houses, or in the centers of lesser towns.</P>
<P>But you need not have these marks at many places at once, as suppose half a score at a time. For when the angles have been taken, at the two stations, to all these places, the marks may be moved to new ones; and so successively to all the places you want. These marks then being set up at a convenient number of places, and such as may be seen from both stations; go to one of these stations, and with an instrument to take
<PB N="214" REF="226"/>angles, standing at that station, take all the angles be∣tween the other station, and each of these marks, ob∣serving which is blue, which red, &amp;c. and which hand they lie on; and set all down with their colours. Then go to the other station, and take all the angles between the first station, and each of the former marks, and set them down with the others, each against his fellow with the same colour. You may, if you can, also take the angles at some third station, which may serve to prove the work, if the three lines intersect in that point, where any mark stands. The marks must stand till the observations are finished at both stations; and then they must be taken down, and set up at fresh places. And the same operations must be performed, at both stations, for these fresh places; and the like for others. Your instrument for taking angles must be an exceeding good one, made on purpose with telescopic sights; and of three, four, or five feet radius. A circumferentor is reckoned a good instrument for this purpose.</P>
<P N="3">3. And though it is not absolutely necessary to mea∣sure any distance, because any stationary line being laid down from any scale, all the other lines will be propor∣tional to it; yet it is better to measure some of the lines, to ascertain the distances of places in miles; and to know how many geometrical miles there are in any length; and from thence to make a scale to measure any distance in miles. In measuring any distance, it will not be exact-enough to go along the high roads; by rea∣son of their turnings and windings, and hardly ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> lying in a right line between the stations, which must cause infinite reductions, and create endless trouble to make it a right line; for which reason it can never be exact. But a better way is to measure in a right line with a chain, between station and station, over hills and dales or level fields, and all obstacles. Only in case of water, woods, towns, rocks, banks, &amp;c. where one cannot pass; such parts of the line must be measured by the methods of inaccessible distances; and besides, allow∣ing for ascents and descents, when we meet with them.
<PB N="215" REF="227"/>And a good compass that shews the bearing of the two stations, will always direct you to go straight, when you do not see the two stations; and in your progress, if you can go straight, you may take offsets to any re∣markable places, likewise note the intersection of your stationary line with all roads, rivers, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. And from all your stations, and in your whole pro∣gress, be very particular in observing sea coasts, river mouths, towns, castles, houses, churches, windmills, watermills, trees, rocks, sands, roads, bridges, fords, ferries, woods, hills, mountains, rills, brooks, parks, beacons, sluices, floodgates, looks, &amp;c. and in general all things that are remarkable.</P>
<P N="5">5. After you have done with your first and main station lines, which command the whole county; you must then take inner stations, at some places already determined; which will divide the whole into several partitions: and from these stations you must determine the places of as many of the remaining towns as you can. And if any remain in that part, you must take more stations, at some places already determined; from which you may determine the rest. And thus we must go through all the parts of the county, taking station after station, till we have determined all we want. And in general the station distances must always pass through such remarkable points as have been determined before, by the former stations.</P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, the position of the station line you mea∣sure, or the point of the compass it lies on, must be de∣termined by astronomical observation. Hang up a thread and plummet in the sun, over some part of the station line, and observe when the shadow runs along that line, and at that moment take the sun's altitude; then having his declination, and the latitude, the azimuth will be found by spherical trigonometry. And the azimuth is the angle the station line makes with the meridian; and therefore a meridian may easily be drawn through the map. Or a meridian may be drawn through it by hanging up two threads in a line with the
<PB N="216" REF="228"/>pole star, when he is just north, which may be known from astronomical tables. Or thus; observe the star Alioth, or that in the rump of the great bear, be∣ing that next the square; or else Cassiopeia's hip; I say, observe by a line and plummet when either of these stars and the pole star come into a perpendicular; and at that time they are due north. Therefore two per∣pendicular lines being fixed at that moment, towards these two stars, will give the position of the meridian.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROBLEM XIII. <HI>To Survey a Town or City.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This may be done with any of the instruments for taking angles, but best of all with the plain table, where every minute part is drawn while in sight. It is best also to have a chain of 50 feet long, divided into 50 links, and an offset-staff of 10 feet long.</P>
<P>Begin at the meeting of two or more of the principal streets, through which you can have the longest pro∣spects, to get the longest station lines. There having fixed the instrument, draw lines of direction along those streets, using two men as marks, or poles set in wooden pedestals, or perhaps some remarkable places in the houses at the further ends, as windows, doors, cor∣ners, &amp;c. Measure these lines with the chain, taking offsets with the staff, at all corners of streets, bendings, or windings, and to all remarkable things, as churches, markets, halls, colleges, eminent houses, &amp;c. Then remove the instrument to another station along one of these lines; and there repeat the same process as be∣fore. And so on till the whole is finished.</P>

<P>Thus, fix the instrument at A, and draw lines in the direction of all the streets meeting there; and measure AB, noting the street on the left at m. At the second station B, draw the directions of the streets meeting there; measure from B to C, noting the places of the streets at n and o as you pass by them. At the 3d station C take the direction of all the streets meeting there, and measure CD. At D do the same, and measure DE, noting the place of the cross streets at P. And in this manner go through all the principal streets. This done, proceed to the smaller and intermediate streets; and lastly to the lanes, alleys, courts, yards, and every part that it may be thought proper to represent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. <HI>Of Planning, Casting-up, and Dividing.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROBLEM I. <HI>To Lay down the Plan of any Survey.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the survey was taken with a plain table, you have a rough plan of it already on the paper which cover∣ed the table. But if the survey was with any other in∣strument, a plan of it is to be drawn from the measures that were taken in the survey, and first of all a rough plan upon paper.</P>
<P>To do this, you must have a set of proper instruments, for laying down both lines and angles, &amp;c. as scales of various sizes, the more of them, and the more accurate, the better; scales of chords, protractors, perpendicular and parallel rulers, &amp;c. Diagonal scales are best for the lines, because they extend to three figures, or chains and links, which are hundredth parts of chains. But in using the diagonal scale, a pair of compasses must be employed to take off the lengths of the principal lines very accurately. But a scale with a thin edge divided, is much readier for laying down the perpendicular off∣sets to crooked hedges, and for marking the places of those offsets upon the station line; which is done at only one application of the edge of the scale to that line, and then pricking off all at once the distances along it. Angles are to be laid down either with a good scale of chords, which is perhaps the most accurate way; or with a large protractor, which is much readier when many angles are to be laid down at one point, as they are pricked off all at once round the edge of the pro∣tractor.</P>
<P>Very particular directions for laying down all sorts of figures cannot be necessary in this place, to any person who has learned practical geometry, and the construc∣tion of figures, and the use of his instruments. It may
<PB N="219" REF="231"/>therefore be sufficient to observe, that all lines and angles must be laid down on the plan in the same order in which they were measured in the field, and in which they are written in the field-book; laying down first the angles for the position of lines, then the lengths of the lines, with the places of the offsets, and then the lengths of the offsets themselves, all with dry or obscure lines; then a black line drawn through the extremities of all the offsets, will be the hedge or bounding line of the field, &amp;c. After the principal bounds and lines are laid down, and made to fit or close properly, proceed next to the smaller objects, till you have entered every thing that ought to appear in the plan, as houses, brooks, trees, hills, gates, stiles, roads, lanes, mills, bridges, wood∣lands, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The north side of a map or plan is commonly placed uppermost, and a meridian somewhere drawn, with the compass or flower-de-luce pointing north. Also, in a va∣cant part, a scale of equal parts or chains must be drawn, and the title of the map in conspicuous characters, and embellished with a compartment. All hills must be shadowed, to distinguish them in the map. Colour the hedges with different colours; represent hilly grounds by broken hills and valleys; draw single dotted lines for foot-paths, and double ones for horse or carriage roads. Write the name of each field and remarkable place within it, and, if you choose, its content in acres, roods, and perches.</P>
<P>In a very large estate, or a county, draw vertical and horizontal lines through the map, denoting the spaces between them by letters, placed at the top, and bottom, and sides, for readily finding any field or other object, mentioned in a table.</P>
<P>In mapping counties, and estates that have uneven grounds of hills and valleys, reduce all oblique lines, measured up hill and down hill, to horizontal straight lines, if that was not done during the survey, before they were entered in the field-book, by making a pro∣per allowance to shorten them. For which purpose
<PB N="220" REF="232"/>there is commonly a small table engraven on some of the instruments for surveying.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROBLEM II. <HI>To Cast up the Contents of Fields.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Compute the contents of the figures, whether triangles, or trapeziums, &amp;c. by the proper rules for the several figures laid down in measuring; multiplying the lengths by the breadths, both in links; the product is acres after you have cut off five figures on the right, for decimals; then bring these decimals to roods and perches, by multiplying first by 4, and then by 40. An example of which is given in the description of the chain, page 187.</P>
<P N="2">2. In small and separate pieces, it is usual to cast up their contents from the measures of the lines taken in surveying them, without making a correct plan of them.</P>
<P>Thus, in the triangle in prob. iv, page 199, where we had AP=794, and AB=1321</P>

<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="222" REF="234"/>3. In pieces bounded by very crooked and winding hedges, measured by offsets, all the parts between the offsets are most accurately measured separately as small trapezoids. Thus, for the example to prob. 111, p. 198, where

<P>Then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="223" REF="235"/>4. Sometimes such pieces as that above, are computed by finding a mean breadth, by dividing the sum of the offsets by the number of them, accounting that for one of them where the boundary meets the station line, as at A; then multiply the length AB by that mean breadth. Thus:
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P N="5">5. But in larger pieces, and whole estates, consisting of many fields, it is the common practice to make a rough plan of the whole, and from it compute the con∣tents quite independent of the measures of the lines and angles that were taken in surveying. For then new lines are drawn in the fields in the plan, so as to divide them into trapeziums and triangles, the bases and per∣pendiculars of which are measured on the plan by means of the seales from which it was drawn, and so multiplied together for the contents. In this way the work is very expeditiously done, and sufficiently correct; for such dimensions are taken, as afford the most easy method of calculation; and, among a number of parts, thus taken and applied to a seale, it is likely that some of the parts will be taken a small matter too little, and others too great; so that they will, upon the whole, in all probability, very nearly balance one another. After all the fields, and particular parts, are thus com∣puted
<PB N="224" REF="236"/>separately, and added all together into one sum, calculate the whole estate independent of the fields, by dividing it into large and arbitrary triangles and trape∣ziums, and add these also together. Then if this sum be equal to the former, or nearly so, the work is right; but if the sums have any considerable difference, it is wrong, and they must be examined, and recomputed, till they nearly agree.</P>
<P>A specimen of dividing into one triangle, or one tra∣pezium, which will do for most single fields, may be seen in the examples to the last problem; and a speci∣men of dividing a large tract into several such trapezi∣ums and triangles, in prob. VI of chapter II of Sur∣veying, page 201, where a piece is so divided, and its dimensions taken and set down; and again at prob. VI of mensuration of surfaces, where the contents of the same piece are computed.</P>
<P N="6">6. But the chief secret in casting up, consists in find∣ing the contents of pieces bounded by curved, or very irregular lines, or in reducing such crooked sides of fields or boundaries to straight lines, that shall inclose the same or equal area with those crooked sides, and so obtain the area of the curved figure by means of the right-lined one, which will commonly be a trapezium. Now this reducing the crooked sides to straight ones, is very easily and accurately performed thus: Apply the straight edge of a thin, clear piece of lanthorn-horn to the crooked line, which is to be reduced, in such a man∣ner, that the small parts cut off from the crooked figure by it, may be equal to those which are taken in: which equality of the parts included and excluded, you will presently be able to judge of very nicely by a little practice: then with a pencil draw a line by the straight edge of the horn. Do the same by the other sides of the field or figure. So shall you have a straight sided figure equal to the curved one; the content of which, being computed as before directed, will be the content of the curved figure proposed.</P>
<P>Or, instead of the straight edge of the horn, a horse-hair
<PB N="225" REF="237"/>may be applied across the crooked sides in the same manner; and the easiest way of using the hair, is to string a small slender bow with it, either of wire, or cane, or whale-bone, or such like slender springy matter; for, the bow keeping it always stretched, it can be easily and neatly applied with one hand, while the other is at liberty to make two marks by the side of it, to draw the straight line by.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<P>Thus, let it be required to find the contents of the same figure as in prob. IX of the last chapter, page 207, to a scale of 4 chains to an inch.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Draw the four dotted straight lines AB, BC, CD, DA, cutting off equal quantities on both sides of them, which they do as near as the eye can judge: so is the crooked figure reduced to an equivalent right-lined one of four sides ABCD. Then draw the diagonal BD, which, by applying a proper scale to it, measures 1256. Also the perpendicular, or nearest distance, from A to this diagonal, measures 456; and the distance of C from it, is 428.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="238"/>Then
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>And thus the content of the trapezium, and conse∣quently of the irregular figure, to which it is equal, is easily found to be 5 acres, 2 roods, 8 perches.</P>

<HEAD>PROBLEM III. <HI>To Transfer a Plan to another Paper, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>After the rough plan is completed, and a fair one is wanted; this may be done, either on paper or vellum, by any of the following methods.</P>
<DIV5 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>FIRST METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>Lay the rough plan upon the clean paper, and keep them always pressed flat and close together, by weights laid upon them. Then, with the point of a fine pin or pricker, prick through all the corners of the plan to be copied. Take them asunder, and connect the pricked points, on the clean paper, with lines; and it is done.
<PB N="227" REF="239"/>This method is only to be practised in plans of such figures as are small and tolerably regular, or bounded by right lines.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>SECOND METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>Rub the back of the rough plan over with black lead powder; and lay the said black part upon the clean pa∣per, upon which the plan is to be copied, and in the pro∣per position. Then with the blunt point of some hard substance, as brass, or such like, trace over the lines of the whole plan; pressing the tracer so much as that the black lead under the lines may be transferred to the clean paper: after which take off the rough plan, and trace over the leaden marks with common ink, or with indian ink, &amp;c.—Or, instead of blacking the rough plan, you may keep constantly a blacked paper to lay between the plans.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="3" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>THIRD METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>Another method of copying plans, is by means of squares. This is performed by dividing both ends and sides of the plan, which is to be copied, into any con∣venient number of equal parts, and connecting the corresponding points of division with lines; which will divide the plan into a number of small squares. Then divide the paper, upon which the plan is to be copied, into the same number of squares, each equal to the for∣mer when the plan is to be copied of the same size, but greater or less than the others, in the proportion in which the plan is to be increased or diminished, when of a different size. Lastly, copy into the clean squares, the parts contained in the corresponding squares of the old plan; and you will have the copy either of the same size, or greater or less in any proportion.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="4" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>FOURTH METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>A fourth method is by the instrument called a penta∣graph, which also copies the plan in any size required.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="5" TYPE="method">
<PB N="228" REF="240"/>
<HEAD>FIFTH METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>But the neatest method of any is this. Procure a copying frame or glass, made in this manner; namely, a large square of the best window glass, set in a broad frame of wood, which can be raised up to any angle, when the lower side of it rests on a table. Set this frame up to any angle before you, facing a strong light; fix the old plan and clean paper together with several pins quite around, to keep them together, the clean paper being laid uppermost, and upon the face of the plan to be copied. Lay them, with the back of the old plan, upon the glass, namely, that part which you intend to begin at to copy first; and, by means of the light shining through the papers, you will very distinctly perceive every line of the plan through the clean pa∣per. In this state then trace all the lines on the paper with a pencil. Having drawn that part which covers the glass, slide another part over the glass, and copy it in the same manner. And then another part. And so on till the whole be copied.</P>
<P>Then, take them asunder, and trace all the pencil∣lines over with a sine pen and Indian ink, or with com∣mon ink.</P>
<P>And thus you may copy the finest plan, without in∣juring it in the least.</P>
<P>When the lines, &amp;c. are copied upon the clean pa∣per or vellum, the next business is to write such names, remarks, or explanations as may be judged necessary; laying down the scale for taking the lengths of any parts, a flower-de-luce to point out the direction, and the proper title ornamented with a compartment; and illustrating or colouring every part in such manner as shall seem most natural, such as shading rivers or brooks with crooked lines, drawing the representations of trees, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes, hills, woods, hedges, houses, gates, roads, &amp;c. in their proper places; running a single dotted line for a foot path, and a double one for a car∣riage road; and either representing the bases or the elevations of buildings, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>OF GAUGING.</HEAD>
<P>THE business of cask-gauging is commonly per∣formed by two instruments, namely, the gauging or sliding-rule, and the gauging or diagonal rod.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>1. OF THE GAUGING RULE.</HEAD>
<P>This instrument serves to compute the contents of casks, &amp;c. after the dimensions have been taken. It is a square rule, having various logarithmic lines on its four sides or faces; and three sliding pieces, running in grooves, in three of them.</P>
<P>Upon the first face are three lines, namely, two mark∣ed A, B, for multiplying and dividing; and the third, MD, for malt depth, because it serves to gauge malt. The middle one B is upon the slider, and is a kind of double line, being marked at both the edges of the slider, for applying it to both the lines A and MD. These three lines are all of the same radius, or distance from 1 to 10, each containing twice the length of the radius. A and B are placed and numbered exactly alike, each beginning at 1, which may be either 1, or 10, or 100, &amp;c. or .1, or .01, or .001, &amp;c. but whatever it is, the
<PB N="266" REF="278"/>middle division 10, will be 10 times as much, and the last division 100 times as much. But 1 on the line MD is opposite 215, or more exactly 2150.4 on the other lines, which number 2150.4 denotes the cubic inches in a malt bushel; and its divisions numbered retrograde to those of A and B. Upon these two lines are also several other marks and letters: thus, on the line A are M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for malt bushel, at the number 2150.4; and A for ale, at 282, the cubic inches in an ale gallon; and upon the line B is W, for wine, at 231, the cubic inches in a wine gallon; also <HI>si,</HI> for square inscribed, at .707, the side of a square inscribed in a circle whose diameter is 1; <HI>se,</HI> for square equal, at .886, the side of a square which is equal to the same circle; and c, for circum∣ference, at 3.1416, the circumference of the same circle.</P>
<P>Upon the second face, or that opposite the first, are a slider and four lines, marked D, C, D, E, at one end, and root, square, root, cube, at the other; the lines C and E containing respectively the squares and cubes of the opposite numbers on the lines D, D; the radius of D being double to that of A, B, C, and triple to that of E: so that whatever the first 1 on D denotes, the first on C is the square of it, and the first on E the cube of it; so if D begin with 1, C and E will begin with 1; but if D begin with 10, C will begin with 100, and E with 1000; and so on. Upon the line C are marked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at .0796, for the area of the circle whose circumference is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and 0 <HI>d</HI> at .7854 for the area of the circle whose diameter is 1. Also, upon the line D are WG, for wine gauge, at 17.15; and AG for ale gauge, at 18.95; and MR, for malt round, at 52.32; these three being the gauge points for round or circular measure, and are found by dividing the square roots of 231, 282, and 2150.4 by the square root of .7854: also MS, for malt square, are marked at 46.37, the malt gauge point for square mea∣sure being the square root of 2150.4.</P>
<P>Upon the third face are three lines, one upon a slider marked N; and two on the stock, marked SS and SL,<PB N="267" REF="279"/>for segment standing and segment lying, which serve for ullaging standing and lying casks.</P>
<P>And upon the fourth, or opposite face, are a scale of inches, and three other scales, marked spheroid or 1st variety, 2d variety, 3d variety; the scale for the 4th, or conic variety, being on the inside of the slider in the third face. The use of these lines is to find the mean diameters of casks.</P>
<P>Besides all those lines, there are two others on the in∣sides of the two first sliders, being continued from the one slider to the other. The one of these is a scale of inches, from 12½ to 36; and the other is a scale of ale gallons between the corresponding numbers .435 and 3.61; which form a table to shew, in ale gallons, the contents of all cylinders whose diameters are from 12½ to 36 inches, their common altitude being 1 inch.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE GAUGING OR DIAGONAL ROD.</HEAD>
<P>The diagonal rod is a square rule, having four faces; being commonly 4 feet long, and folding together by joints. This instrument is used both for gauging or measuring casks, and computing their contents, and that from one dimension only, namely the diagonal of the cask, or the length from the middle of the bung-hole
<PB N="270" REF="282"/>to the meeting of the head of the cask with the stave opposite to the bung; and is the longest line that can be drawn within the cask from the middle of the bung. And, accordingly, on one face of the rule is a scale of inches, for measuring this diagonal; to which are placed the areas, in ale gallons, of circles to the cor∣responding diameters, in like manner as the lines on the under sides of the three slides in the sliding rule.</P>
<P>On the opposite face are two scales of ale and wine gallons, expressing the contents of casks having the cor∣responding diagonals. And these are the lines which chiefly form the difference between this instrument and the sliding rule; for all their other lines are the same, and to be used in the same manner.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<P>The rod being applied within the cask at the bung-hole, the diagonal was found to be 34.4 inches; re∣quired the content in gallons.</P>
<P>Now to 34.4 inches correspond, on the rod, 90¼ ale gallons or 111 wine gallons; the content required.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE PILING OF BALLS AND SHELLS.</HEAD>
<P>IRON balls and shells are commonly piled, by hori∣zontal courses, either in a pyramidical or wedge-like form; the base being either an equilateral triangle, a square, or a rectangle. In the triangle and square, the pile will finish in a single ball; but in the rectangle, it will finish in a single row of balls, like an edge.</P>
<P>In triangular and square piles, the number of hori∣zontal rows, or courses, is always equal to the number of balls in one side of the bottom row. And in rectan∣gular piles, the number of rows is equal to the number of balls in the breadth of the bottom row. Also the number in the top row, or edge, is one more than the difference between the length and breadth of the bot∣tom row.</P>

<HEAD>OF DISTANCES BY THE VELOCITY OF SOUND.</HEAD>
<P>BY various experiments it has been found that sound flies, through the air, uniformly at the rate of about 1142 feet in 1 second of time, or a mile in 4⅔ se∣conds. And therefore, by proportion, any distance may be found corresponding to any given time; namely, multiply the given time in seconds, by 1142, for the corresponding distance in feet; or take 3/14 of the given time for the distance in miles.</P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> The time for the passage of sound in the in∣terval between seeing the flash of a gun, or lightning, and hearing the report, may be observed by a watch, or a small pendulum. Or it may be observed by the beats of the pulse in the wrist, counting, on an average, about 70 to a second in persons in moderate health, or 5½ pulsations to a mile, and more or less according to cir∣cumstances.</P>

<HEAD>THE USE OF THE TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing table, each number in the column of <HI>area seg.</HI> is the area of the circular segment whose height, or the versed fine of its half are, is the number immediately on the left of it, in the column of <HI>heights;</HI> the diameter of the circle being 1, and its whole area .785398.</P>
<P>The use of this table is to find, by it, the area of the segment of any other circle, whatever be the diameter. And this is done by first dividing the height of any pro∣posed segment by its own diameter, and the quotient is a decimal to be sought in the column of heights, and against it is the tabular area to be taken out, which is similar to the proposed segment. Then this tabular area being multiplied by the square of the given diameter, will be the area of your segment required; because similar areas are to each other as the squares of their diameters.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<P>So if it be required to find the area of a segment of a circle, whose height is 3¼, the diameter being 50.</P>
<P>Here 50) 3.25 (.065 quot. or tab. height, and the tab. seg. is .021659 which multiply by 2500 the square of the diam. gives 54.147500 the area required.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="335"/>But, in dividing the given height by the diameter, if the quotient do not terminate in three places of deci∣mals without a fractional remainder, then the area for that fractional part ought to be proportioned for, thus: Having found the tabular area answering to the first three decimals of the quotient, take the difference be∣tween it and the next following tabular area, which difference multiply by the fractional remaining part of the quotient, and the product will be the corresponding proportional part, to be added to the first tabular area.</P>
<P>So if the height of a proposed segment were 3⅓, to the diameter 50.</P>
