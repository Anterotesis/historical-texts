<P>UPON no other View do I
make a Dedication of this
Discourse to your <HI>Lordship,</HI>
than to submit it to your acute Judg∣ment,
expecting soon to hear of your
Approbation or Dislike of it. If it
so happen, that you highly approve
of it, I beg of you to be sparing of
your Commendations, least I should be
puff'd up with them.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3" MS="y"/>
In my <HI>Moderator,</HI> some Expres∣sions
dropt from ny Pen about the
Miracles of our Saviour, which, for
want of Illustration then, gave your
<HI>Lordship</HI> some offence, and brought
upon me more Trouble: But, having
now fully and clearly explain'd my self
out of the Fathers, I hope you'll be
reconciled to me; and as you are a
Lover of Truth, will, against Interest
and Prejndice, yield to the Force
of it.</P>
<P>Whether your Prosecution of me,
for the <HI>Moderator,</HI> was just and rea∣sonable,
I'll not dispute here, having
already expostulated that matter with
you, in several Letters, to which you
would not condescend to give me any
Answer. For what Reason you was
silent is best known to your self. But
in my own Vindication, I hope, I
muy publish without Offence, that your
taking me for an <HI>Infidel</HI> was such a
Mistake, as I thought no <HI>Schoar</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
could have made; and the Injury done
to my Reputation and low Fortunes,
by the Prosecution, so considerable, that
the least I expected from your <HI>Lord∣ship</HI>
was a courteous Excuse, if not an
ample Compensation for it.</P>
<P>As to the Expediency of prosecuting
<HI>Infidels</HI> for their writings (in whose
Cause I am the farthest of any Man
from being engaged) I will here say
nothing. The Argument, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI>
has already, by one or other, been co∣piously
handled. And I don't know,
but I might be, with your <HI>Lordship,</HI>
on the persecuting side of the Question;
but that it looks, as if a Man was
distrustful of the Truth of Christianity,
and conscious of his own Inability to
defend it; or he would leave that good
Cause to God himself, and the Sword
of the Spirit, without calling upon
the <HI>Civil Magistrate,</HI> for his Aid and
Assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
That Scurvy <HI>Writer</HI> of the <HI>Scheme
of litteral Prophecy, &amp;c.</HI> which your
<HI>Lordship</HI> must have heard of, would
insinuate, that they are only Atheisti∣cal
<HI>Priests,</HI> who, for fear of their In∣terests
in the Church, set Persecutions
on foot: But after your <HI>Lordship</HI> has
publish'd a Strenuous Defence of
Christianity to the Purpose of our pre∣sent
Controversy, I'll have no such
suspicions of you.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s persecuting (or if
you will prosecuting) Humour is re∣putedly
all pure Zeal for God's Glory;
and, with all my Heart, let it be so
accounted, whether it be according to
Knowledge or not. Against Popery
and Infidelity you are all Ardency!
Who do's not commend you? Who can
question the sincerity of the Zeal of a
Protestant <HI>Bishop,</HI> and of a Prostestant
<HI>Clergy,</HI> when they persecute the Ene∣mys
of their Church, that considers
their own steadiness to Principles a∣gainst
Interest, under all Changes,
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
since the Reformation; and their Ab∣horrence
of Extortion upon the People,
for the Dutys of their Function, in and
about this City. Such Honesty and
Constancy in their Profession is a Proof
of the Integrity of their Hearts, or I
know not where to find one.</P>
<P>But that your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Zeal for
Religion is very remarkable and suc∣cessful,
I could prove by many Instan∣ces;
one is, <HI>that</HI> of your routing a tur∣bulent
Sect of <HI>Peripateticks</HI> our of St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s Cathedral; and if you could
as effectually clear <HI>Christ</HI>'s Church, of
<HI>Infidels,</HI> what a Glorious Bishop
would you be!</P>
<P>And what Pitty is it, that <HI>Infidels</HI>
likewise are not to be quell'd with your
Threats and Terrors? which (with∣out
the Weapons of sharp Reasonings
and thumping Arguments, that others
are for the Use of) would transmit
your Fame to Posterity, for a notable
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
Champion for Christianity, as cer∣tainly
as, that your judicious Prose∣cution
of the <HI>Moderator</HI> for Infidelity
is here remembr'd, by</P>

<HEAD>A
DISCOURSE
On the
MIRACLES of our SAVIOUR, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F ever there was an useful
Controversy started, or re∣vived
in this Age of the
Church, it is <HI>this</HI> about the
<HI>Messiahship</HI> of the Holy Jesus,
which the <HI>Discourse of the
Grounds,</HI> &amp;c. has of late rais'd. I be∣leive
this Controversy will end in the
absolute Demonstration of Jesus's <HI>Messiah∣ship</HI>
from Prophecy, which is the only
way to prove him to be the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that
great Prophet expected by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and
promised under the Old Testament. And
tho' this way of Proof from Prophecy seems
to labour under many Difficulties at present,
and tho' some <HI>Writers</HI> against the <HI>Grounds,</HI>
being distressed with those Difficulties, are
fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>eeking Refuge in the Miracles of our
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
Saviour; yet we must persist in it, till what
I have no doubt of, his <HI>Messiahship</HI> shall be
clearly made out by it.</P>
<P>And the way in Prophecy, that I would
take for the Proof of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>Messiahship</HI>
should be by an Allegorical Interpretation,
and Application of the Law and the Pro∣phets
to him; the very same Way, that all
the Fathers of the Church have gone in;
and the very same Way, in which all the
Ancient <HI>Jews</HI> say their <HI>Messiah</HI> was to ful∣fil
the Law and the Prophets: But this
Way does not please our Ecclesiastical <HI>Writ∣ers</HI>
in this Controversy, neither will they
at present give any Ear to it.</P>
<P>The Way in Prophecy, that they are for
taking is by a Litteral Interpretation and Ap∣plcation
of some Prophecys of the Old Testa∣ment
to our <HI>Jesus,</HI> but they are hitherto un∣successful
in this Way. The Authors of the
<HI>Grounds</HI> and of the <HI>Scheme</HI> grievously perplex
them with their Objections against this Way
of Proof, so far as, being sensible, I say, of
almost insuperable Difficultys in it, they are
flying apace to the Miracles of our Saviour,
as to their sole and grand Refuge.</P>
<P>But to show, that there's no Sanctuary
for them in the Miracles of our Saviour, I
write this Discourse: And this I do, not
for the service of Infidelity, which has no
Place in my Heart; but for the honour of
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
the Holy <HI>Jesus,</HI> and to reduce the <HI>Clergy</HI>
to the good old way of interpreting Pro∣phecys,
which the Church has unhappily
apostatis'd from, and which, upon the
Testimony of the Fathers, will, one Day.
be the Conversion of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>For this Opinion, that there is no Sanctu∣ary
in the Miracles of our Saviour, I chanc'd
to say in the <HI>Moderator,</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Page 44.</NOTE> <HI>That Jesus's Mi∣racles,
as they are now a days understood, make
nothing for his Authority and Messiahship</HI>; and
again, <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">p. 53.</NOTE> <HI>that I believe upon good Authority,
some of the Miracles of Jesus, as recorded by
the Evangelists were never wrought, but are
only related as Prophetical and Parabolical
Narratives of what will be mysteriously and
more wonderfully done by him:</HI> Which ex∣pressions
gave offence to some of our <HI>Clergy,</HI>
and brought upon me their Indignation and
Displeasure. I see no Reason to depart
from the said Expressions, or so much as
to palliate and soften them, much less to
retract them; but in maintenance of my
Opinion, to the Honour of our <HI>Messiah,</HI> and
and the Defence of Christianity, I write
this Treatise on Jesus's Miracles, and take
this method following.</P>
<P N="1">I. I will show, that the Miracles of Heal∣ing
all manner of Bodily Diseases, which
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<HI>Jesus</HI> was justly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> neither are
they so much as a good Proof of his Divine
Authority to found a Religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the litteral History of many of
the Miracles of Jesus, as recorded by the
Evangelists, does imply Absurditys, Impro∣babilities
and Incredibilitys, consequently,
they, either in whole or in part, were ne∣ver
wrought, as they are commonly believed
now a days, but are only related as Pro∣phetical
and Parabolical Naratives of what
would be mysteriously and more wonderful∣ly
done by him.</P>
<P N="3">III. I shall consider what Jesus means,
when he appeals to his Miracles as to a
Testimony and Witness of his Divine Au∣thority,
and show, that he could not pro∣perly
and ultimately referr to those, he then
wrought in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> but to those Mystical
ones, which he would do in the <HI>Spirit</HI>; of
which those wrought in the Flesh are but
mere Types and Shadows.</P>
<P>In treating on these Heads, I shall not
confine my self only to Reason, but also to
the express Authority of the Fathers, those
holy, venerable and learned Preachers of
he Gospel in the first Ages of the Church,
who took our Religion from the Hands
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
of the Apostles and of Apostolical Men,
who dy'd, some of them, and suffer'd for
the Doctrine they taught; who professedly
and confessedly were endew'd with Divine
and Extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit; who
consequently can't be supposed to be cor∣rupters
of Christianity, or teachers of false
Notions about the Miracles of our Saviour,
of so much as mistaken about the Aposto∣lical
and Evangelical Sense and Nature of
them. I know not how it comes to pass,
but I am a profound Admirer and an almost
implicit Believer of the Authority of the
Fathers, whom I look upon as vast Philo∣sophres,
very great Scholars, and most Or∣thodox
Divines. Whatever they concur∣rently
assert, I firmly believe. And tho'
they are, for the most part, mysterious
Writers out of the Reach of the Capacitys
of many, who slight them; yet I, who have
had the Honour and Happiness of much of
their Acquaintance, fancy my self well ap∣prised
of their meanings. If at any time
I read a Passage in them, which I don't pre∣sently
apprehend, I salute it with Venera∣tion
for all that; till my Understanding is
open'd to receive the sense of it. If I meet
with but a single Opinion in any one of
them, I pay my Respects to it; but where
there is an Harmony and Agreement of O∣pinion
amongst them, it is with me and
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
ought to be with all Christians, of such
Weight as to bear down all Prejudice,
Opposition, and Contradiction before it; or
the Authority of no Man, whether Anci∣ent
or Modern is to have any Regard paid
to it; and of what ill Consequence to Re∣ligion
such an utter Rejection of Authori∣ty
will be, I need not say.</P>
<P>This I thought fit to premise, concer∣ning
the Authority of the Fathers, to abate
of the Prejudice beforehand, which some
may conceive against the following Dis∣course
about the Miracles of <HI>Jesus.</HI> I don't
question, but some may be startled at the
foregoing Heads, as if, what is the farthest
of any thing from my Heart, the service
of Infidelity was in View; but craving
the Temper and Patience of such Readers
for a while, and they shall find, that it's no
other than just Reasoning, clear Truth, and
Primitive Doctrine about <HI>Jesus's</HI> Miracles,
that I advance; or if it should so happen,
that none besides my self should discern the
Reasoning and Truth of the Argument;
yet I hope it will not be thought a Crime
to revive Primitive Doctrine, which none
will be able to deny it to be, whether they
like it or not. If I err, I err upon Choice
with the Fathers, of whose Faith I am.
And if any are offended at what follows
about the Miracles of <HI>Christ,</HI> let them turn
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
their Displeasure and Indignation against the
Fathers, for whose express or implicit O∣pinions
I can be deserving of no Blame.</P>
<P>I am sorry for the occasion of such a
Preface against Offence, which the Apostacy
of the Age, and its Unacquaintedness with
the Fathers has made necessary. So I enter
upon the particular Handling of the Heads
foregoing. And</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>I. I will show that the Miracles of Heal∣ing
all manner of Bodily Diseases, which
<HI>Jesus</HI> was justly famed for; are none of the
proper Miracles of the Messiah, nor are
they so much as a good Proof of <HI>Jesus's</HI>
Divine Authority to found and introduce
a Religion into the World.</P>
<P>And to do this, let us consider first in
general, what was the Opinion, of the Fa∣thers
about the Writings of the <HI>Evangelists,</HI>
in which the Life of <HI>Christ</HI> is recorded.
<HI>Eucherius</HI> says, <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Universam porro Sacram Scripturam tam Novi quam Veteris Testamenti ad allegoricum sensum esse sumendam, admonet nos vel illud, Aperiam os meum in Parabolis. <HI>In Prasat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> ad Form. Spirit Intell.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That the Scriptures of the
New as well as Old Testament are to be in∣terpreted
in an Allegorical Sense.</HI> And this
his Opinion, is no other, than the common
one of the first Ages of the Church, as
might be proved by many the like Ex∣pressions
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
of other Fathers. As in such Ex∣pressions,
they do not except the Writings
of the <HI>Evangelists</HI>; so they must include the
History of <HI>Christ's</HI> Miracles, which as well
as other Parts of the Hystory of his Life is
to be allegoriz'd for the sake of its true
meaning; consequently the litteral Story of
Christ's Miracles proves nothing.</P>
<P>But let's hear particularly their Opinion
of the Actions and Miracles of our Saviour.
<HI>Origen</HI> says, that <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Si quidem Symbola quaedam erant quae tunc ge∣rebantur eorum, quae Jesu virtute semper preficiun∣tur. <HI>In</HI> Mat. <HI>C.</HI> xv.</NOTE> <HI>whatsoever Jesus did in
the Flesh, was but Typical and Symbolical of
what he would do in the Spirit</HI>; and to our
Purpose, <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Omnis languor &amp; omnis Infirmitas quam san<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avit salvator tunc in Populo referuntur ad Infirmitates spi∣rituals Animarum, <HI>&amp;c. In</HI> Mat. <HI>C.</HI> xvii.</NOTE> that <HI>the several bodily Diseases
which he heal'd, were no other than Figures of
the spiritual Infirmities of the Soul, that are
to be cured by him.</HI> St. <HI>Hilary</HI> is of the same
Mind with <HI>Origen,</HI> as any one may see by
the <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Christi Gesta aliud portendunt. <HI>In</HI> Mat. <HI>C.</HI> 12. Evangelicis gestis est interior Sensus, <HI>c.</HI> 14. Haec li∣cet in praesens gesta sunt, quid tamen in futurum sig∣nificent contuendum est, <HI>c.</HI> 10. Peragunt forma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> futuri gesta praesentia, <HI>c.</HI> 21.</NOTE> Expressions, referr'd to, and his Com∣mentary
on St. <HI>Matthew.</HI> St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Quoe a Jesu facta sunt, alicujus significantia erant. <HI>Serm.</HI> 77.</NOTE> 
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
and St. <HI>John</HI> <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Omne quod fecit Jesus, Sacramenta sunt, <HI>Ho∣mil.</HI> 31. <HI>in</HI> Marc. 9.</NOTE> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> both say, that
the Works of Jesus import farther Mysteries;
and with them, the rest of the Fathers agree,
making the Miracles, that Jesus did then,
no more than the Shadow of some more
powerful and mystical Operations to be done
by him; as I could show by more Citati∣ons
out of them, if it was needful. But
from the foregoing Citations out of the Fa∣thers
it is plain, in their Opinion, that our
modern <HI>Divines</HI> are in the wrong of it to
lay much Stress on any of the Operations
of Jesus, which he did in the Flesh, for the
Proof of his Divine Authority and <HI>Messiah∣ship,</HI>
which is only to be proved by his
more mysterious Works, of which those
done in the Flesh were but Type and Fi∣gure.</P>
<P>But to come closer to the Purpose, let's
see how indifferently, I had almost said con∣temptibly,
the Fathers speak of the Miracles
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and particularly of his Power of
Healing all bodily Diseases, which by mo∣dern
<HI>Writers</HI> is so much magnified and ex∣toll'd.
St. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> says, <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Si enim temporalis erat ab eo Utilitas, nihil grande praestitit iis, qui ab eo curati sunt, <HI>L.V.</HI> c. 12. <HI>S.</HI> 6.</NOTE> that if <HI>we consi∣der
only the then temporal Use of Jesus's Power</HI><PB N="10" REF="17"/>
<HI>of Healing, he did nothing grand and won∣derful</HI>;
consequently <HI>Irenaeus</HI> could not hold,
that Jesus's Miracles then wrought, were
a sufficient Proof of his Divine Authority
much less of his <HI>Messiahship. Origen</HI> says, <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Contra Celsum, <HI>L.</HI> 11.</NOTE> that <HI>tho' many were brought to believe in
Jesus upon the fame of the Miracles, which he
did once among the</HI> Jews, <HI>yet</HI> (what implies
the insufficiency of them for the Conversion
of Men) <HI>he intimates that his greater and my∣stical
Works do prove his Authority.</HI> St. <HI>John</HI> of
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> says, <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Coecum curavit magnum quidem est, quod fe∣cit, sed nisi quotidie fiat, quod olim factum, nobis quidem magnum esse cessavit, <HI>Homil.</HI> 30. <HI>in</HI> Marc. 9.</NOTE> that <HI>Jesus's cures per∣form'd
upon the Blind,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>were indeed consi∣derable
and great, but unless he do daily as
mighty Works in his Church, we ought to for∣bear
our Admiration of him.</HI> St. <HI>Augustin</HI>
not only says, <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Si humano captu &amp; ingenio consideremus Je∣sum facientem, &amp; quod ad potestatem non magnum aliquid fecit, &amp; quod ad benignitatem, parvum secit, <HI>in</HI> Johan <HI>cap.</HI> v. Tract. 17.</NOTE> that <HI>if we examine into
Jesus's Miracles by humane Reason, we shall
find he did nothing great, considering his Al∣mighty
Power, and considering his Goodness,
what he did was but little,</HI> but he tells us al∣so,
that <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Etsi attestabantur Miracula, non defuissent (sicut &amp; nunc mussitant) qui magicae potentiae cuncta illa tribuerent. <HI>Cont. Faust.</HI> L. XII. c. 45.</NOTE> <BIBL>such Works as Jesus did, might</BIBL>
<PB N="11" REF="18"/><HI>be imputed to, and effected by magic Art.</HI>
And accordingly <HI>Moses</HI> and our Saviour
himself confess, that false Prophets and false
Christ's will do Miracles; and <HI>Anti-christ</HI>
himself, according to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> will do them
to the Deception of Mankind. Nay, the
Fathers <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Sanctum Augustinum</HI> de <HI>Anti-christo.</HI></NOTE> say, what I believe, that
<HI>Anti-christ</HI> will imitate and equal <HI>Jesus</HI> in
all his Miracles, which he wrought of old.
How then can we distinguish the true Pro∣phet
from the false, the true Christ from the
Anti christ by Miracles? Our Divines will
find it hard to do it, if what the Fathers
say of <HI>Anti-christ</HI> be found true. Moreover
History affords us Instances of Men, such as
of <HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus, Vespasian,</HI> and of the
<HI>Irish Stroker, Greatrex,</HI> who have miracu∣lously
cured Diseases to the Admiration of
Mankind, as well as our Jesus; but if any
of them, or any other greater Worker of
Miracles, than they were, should withal
assume to himself the Title of a Prophet,
and Author of a new Religion, I humbly
conceive, we ought not to give heed to
him.</P>
<P>Neither is there the least Reason, that
we should; for the Power of doing Mira∣cles
is no certain, nor rational Seal of the
Commission, and Authority of a Divine
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
Lawgiver. St. <HI>Paul</HI> says <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">i Corinth. C. xii.</NOTE> there is a
<HI>Diversity of the Gifts of the Spirit, for to
one is given by the Spirit, the Word of
Wisdom; to another the Word of Knowledge;
to another the Gift of Healing; to another
the working of Miracles; to another Prophecy;
to another Discerning of Spirits; to another
Divers Kinds of Tongues; to another the
Interpretation of Tongues.</HI> These Gifts may
be given a part and separately. One of
them may be conferr'd on this Man, and
another of them on his Neighbour. There
is no necessity, that any two or more of
these Gifts should meet in one Man. To
argue then, that a Man, who has one of
these Gifts, must needs have the other,
that is, that he must needs have the Gift
of Wisdom, or of Prophecy, or of Dis∣cerning
of Spirits, or of Divers kinds of
Tongues, because he has the Gift of Heal∣ing
and of working Miracles, is very in∣conclusive
and false Reasoning: And yet
this is the Reasoning of our modern Wri∣ters
who would prove <HI>Jesus's</HI> Authority,
to found a Religion, from his Miracles.
I don't question, but <HI>Jesus</HI> had all the fore∣said
Gifts, and Powers of the Spirit in a
most superlative Degree; but then it is
unreasonably inferr'd, for all that, that
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
a Man, because he of certainty has some
of them, must of consequence have the other.
St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Atque illud ad Rem maxime partineat, ne decipiamur tendentes ad Contemplationem Veritatis∣arbitrantes ibi osse invisibilem sapientiam, ubi Mi∣raculum visibile viderimus. <HI>In Sermon. Dom. in montc. L.</HI> 2. <HI>Sect.</HI> 84.</NOTE> Cautions us against
being deceived into a good Opinion of a
Man's Wisdom, because of his Power to
do Miracles. And I think accordingly,
that we may as well say, that the strong∣est
Man is the wisest; or that a good
Physician must needs be a good Casuist; or
that the best Mathematician is the ablest
Statesman, as that <HI>Jesus,</HI> because he was a
worker of Miracles, such as his are, and
a Healer of all manner of Diseases, ought
to be received as the Guide of our Con∣sciences,
the Director of our Understand∣ings,
the Ruler of our Hearts, and the
Author of a Religion.</P>
<P>What then will the Writers against
the <HI>Grounds</HI> do to prove <HI>Jesus's</HI> Authori∣ty
and Messiahship from his Miracles?
Or how by his Miracles will they be
able to distinguish him from an Impostor,
a false Prophet, and the <HI>Antichrist?</HI> Why
they will say perhaps</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="21"/>
1. That besides Greatness of Power, there
was nothing but Goodness, Kindness, and
Love to Man-kind shewn in <HI>Jefus's</HI> Miracles.
As to the Miracles of false Prophets and
Impostors, if they be, many of them, of a
kind and benevolent Aspect, yet the <HI>Devil's</HI>
Foot, if we look well to it, will discover it
self in some ludicrous and mischeivous
Pranks: But <HI>Jesus's</HI> Miracles were all of a
beneficent Nature, He went about doing
good, healing all manner of Diseases among
the People, and did no wrong to any one;
which is a good Argument they say, of
his Divine Authority, or God would not
have suffer'd, nor the Devil have work'd
such a Testimony in behalf of it. On
this Head our <HI>Divines</HI> are copious and
rhetorical, and many notable and florid
Harangues have they made on it. But</P>
<P>In Answer to them, they don't seem to
have their Memories at Hand, when they
declaim at this Rate. The Fathers, upon
whose Authority I write, will tell such
Orators, that <HI>Jesus,</HI> if his Miracles are to
be understood in the litteral sence, did not
only as foolish Things, as any Impostor
could do, but very injurious ones to Man∣kind.
I shall not here instance in the
seemingly foolish and injurious things which
Jesus did for Miracles, intending under the
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
next Head to speak to some of them. But
they are such, if litterally true, as out
Divines do believe, as are enough to turn
our stomachs against such a Prophet; and
enough to make us take him for a <HI>Conjuror,</HI>
a <HI>Sorcerer</HI> and a <HI>Wizard</HI> rather, than the
<HI>Messiah</HI> and Prophet of the most High
God. But</P>
<P N="2">2. To prove the Messiahship of the
Holy Jesus from his Miracles, our <HI>Divines</HI>
urge the Prophecys of the Old Testament,
such as that of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> C. XXXV. v. 5, 6.
<HI>Then the Eyes of the blind shall be opened,
and the Ears of the Deaf shall be unstopp'd,
then shall the lame Man leap as the Hart,
and the Tongue of the Dumb sing</HI>; and say
that these Prophecys were accurately ful∣fill'd
by our <HI>Jesus</HI> in the several specifical
Cures of Blindness, Deafness, Lameness
and Dumbness, which he often perform'd
upon one or other; and, in asmuch as
our Saviour seems to appeal to such Pro∣phecys,
do conclude this his Accomplish∣ment
of them to be no less than a De∣monstration,
that he was the true <HI>Messiah,</HI>
that great Prophet, who was to came in∣to
the World. To which I answer,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Accomplishment of
Prophecys that can neither be given forth
by human Foresight, nor fulfill'd in a
Counterfeit, are good Proofs of <HI>Jesus's</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="23"/><HI>Messiahship</HI>; But then, what shall we say
if others besides <HI>Jesus</HI> should do the like
Cures and Miracles? It is said of <HI>An∣tichrist,</HI>
and I believe it, that he will
not only, do all the Miracles, that Jesus
did, but will appeal to the like Prophecys
too. How then we are to distinguish the
true Christ from the false Christ by Mi∣racles
and Prophecys in this Case, is the
Question, which I leave with our Divines
to consider of an Answer to, against the
Time, that it is proved that <HI>Antichrist</HI>
does all those Miracles, which <HI>Jesus</HI> in the
Flesh wrought. But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The foresaid Prophecys and
others mention'd in <HI>Isaiah</HI> neither were,
nor could be Prophecys of the miraculous
Cures of bodily Diseases which Jesus <HI>then</HI>
did. And this may be made appear not
only from the Context of those Prophecy's,
which received then no Accomplishment
from <HI>Jesus,</HI> who ought to have fulfill'd one
Part of the Prophecy as well as the other,
or is not to be taken for the Fulfiller of
either; bur from the Opinion of both <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Fathers,</HI> who adjourn the Accomplish∣ment
of those Prophecys to Christ's Spi∣ritual
Advent; But</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> The Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> in the Place
above cited, speaks not of bodily Blind∣ness
which the <HI>Messiah</HI> is to heal, but of
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
the spiritual Distempers of the Soul, me∣taphorically
so call'd; as may be easily
proved, not only from the Prophecys
themselves, but from the old <HI>Jews,</HI> who
were Allgorical Interpreters of those Di∣stempers,
and from the antient Fathers,
 <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Interim completur et Isaiae Prophetia non tantum in corporalibus, verum etiam in Spiritualibus. Origen. <HI>In Matt. Cap.</HI> xv.

our <HI>Jesus's</HI> Healing of those bodily
Diseases was no proper Accomplishment
of those Prophecys. It is true our Saviour,
<HI>Matt,</HI> xi. 4, 5. seems to appeal to those
Prophecys, and to make his Cure of cor∣poral
Distempers an Accomplishment of
them: But he means not in the litteral
sense, that our <HI>Divines</HI> take him in, as I
shall show hereafter, when I come to con∣sider
what <HI>Jesus</HI> means, by appealing to his
Works and Miracles, as bearing Witness of
him.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Divines</HI> then may admire and adore
<HI>Jesus,</HI> as much as they please, for his Mi∣racles
of Healing bodily Distempers, but I
am for the spiritual <HI>Messiah</HI> that cures those
Distempers of the Soul, that metaphorically
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
pass under the Names of Blindness, Lame∣ness,
Deafness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Cure of these
Spiritual Diseases is the Proper and Mi∣raculous
Work of the true Messiah; for
the sake of which, says <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Et nunc majores sanitates operatur, propter quas non est dedignatus tune exhibere illas minores. <HI>In Serm.</HI> 88.</NOTE> St. <HI>Augustin,</HI>
Jesus condescended to do those <HI>little</HI> Mi∣racles
of healing bodily Distempers, which
were but the Type and Shadow of his
more stupendous Miracles of Curing Spiri∣tual
Diseases. The Cure of Spiritual In∣firmities
is a Godlike <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">In quibus Spiritualibus maxime Christi Per∣sona eminet. <HI>August. Quaest.</HI> 2. <HI>in Lucam.</HI></NOTE> Work, above
the imitation of Man or of <HI>Anti-Christ,</HI>
infinitely more Miraculous, than the Heal∣ing
any Bodily Distempers can be.</P>
<P>Whether our Jesus be at this Day such
a Spiritual Messiah, I leave to our Divines
to consider, with those Spiritual Distempers
of the Church, that seem to want his Mi∣raculous
Hand and Touch. The Fathers of
the Church said, that <HI>Jesus</HI> was <HI>in part</HI> such
a Spiritual <HI>Messiah</HI> in their Time, and ar∣gued
 <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Modo Caro caeca, non aperit oculos miraculo Domini, sed cor caecum aperit oculos sermoni Do∣mini. Modo non refurgit mortale cadaver, sed re∣surgit anima quae mortua jucebat in vivo Cadavere, &amp;c. <HI>August Serm.</HI> 88. S. 3.</NOTE> his Messiahship, not from bodily
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
Cures, but from his most Miraculous Cures
of the Diseases of the Soul; But there
was another and future Time, in which he
would be such a Spiritual and Glorious <HI>Mes∣siah</HI>
to the greatest Perfection. In the mean
while no Healing of Corporal Distempers
can prove <HI>Jesus</HI> to be the Messiah, nor any
other of his Miraculous Works recorded in
the Evangelists, so far from it. That</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>II. I shall prove, that the litteral Story
of many of Jesus's Miracles, as they are
recorded in the Evangelists and commonly
believed by Christians, does imply Im∣probabilities,
and Incredibilities and the
grossest Absuidities, very dishonourable to
the Name of Christ; consequently, they,
in Whole or in Part, were never wrought,
but are only related as Prophetical and Para∣bolical
Naratives of what would be Mysteri∣ously
and more Wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P>The reading of this Head will, I doubt
not, strike with Horror, some of our
squeamish <HI>Divines,</HI> who, notwithstanding
they will Sacrifice almost any Principles to
their Interest, will not bear that our Lit∣teral
Evangelical History of such renown'd
Miracles should be thus call'd in Question,
and contemptuously spoken of. What does
this <HI>Author</HI> mean, will some say, thus to
do service to Atheism and Infidelity? Away
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
with him! Our Indignation is moved a∣gainst
him! No Censure and Punishment
can be too severe for such Impiety, Pro∣faneness,
and Blasphemy, as is aim'd at, and
imply'd in this Proposition.</P>
<P>To calm therefore the Spirits and abate
the Prejudices of such Accusers, I must
proceed with the greater Caution; and with
Reason and Authority well fortifie my self
before and behind, or I shall feel the Weight
of the Displeasure of our <HI>Divines,</HI> who are
prepossess'd of the Belief of the Litteral
Story of all Jesus's Miracles.</P>
<P>Before then I enter upon the particular
Examination of any of his Miracles, I will
premise two or three general Assertions of
the Fathers about them. And first <HI>Origen</HI>
 <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Historia Scripturae interdum interserit quae∣dam vel minus gesta, vel quae omnino geri non pos∣sunt, interdum quae possunt geri, nec tamen gesta sunt. <HI>De Principiis. Lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> says that in the Historical Part of
the Scriptures, <HI>there are some Things in∣scrted,
as History, which were never trans∣acted,
and which it was impossible should be
transacted, and other things again, that might
possibly be done, but were not.</HI> This he as∣serts
of the writings of the <HI>Evangelists,</HI>
as well as of the Old Testament; and gives
many Instances to this Purpose. St. <HI>Hil∣ary</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
 <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">Multa sunt, quae non sinunt nos simplici sensu dicta evangelica suscipere. Interpositis euim non∣nullis Rebus quae ex Natura humani sensus sibi con∣traria sunt. Rationem quaerere caelestis Intellgentiae admonemur. <HI>In Matt. L.</HI> xx. <HI>S.</HI> 2.</NOTE> says, <HI>there are many Historical Pas∣sages
of the New Testament, that if they are
taken litterally are contrary to Sense and
Reason, and therefore there is a Necessity of
a Mystical Interpretation.</HI> And St. <HI>Augustin</HI>
 <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Evangelica Sacramenta in Christi factis sig∣nata omnibus non patent, et ea nonnulli minus di∣ligenter interpretando afferunt plerumque pro salute Perniciem, et pro Cognitione Veritatis Errorem, &amp;c. <HI>De Quest.

in the Works and Miracles of our Saviour,
which if we inca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>iously and literally inter∣pret,
we shall run into Errors and make
grievous Blunders.</HI> Of the same Mind are
the Rest of the Fathers, as might be proved
by express or implicit Citations; but,
studying Brevity, I think the three Testi∣monys
above enough to cool the Rage
and assuage the Prejudices of my Adver∣saries
against the Proposition before us,
which I now come to a particular Conside∣ration
of, that is, to shew that the story of
many of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles is literally ab∣surd, improbable and incredible. And</P>
<P N="1">1. To speak to that Miracle of Jesus's
<HI>driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the</HI> <PB N="22" REF="29"/>
<HI>Temple,</HI> which all the <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Matt. C. xxi. Mark C. xi. Luke C. xix. John C. ii.</NOTE> four Evangelists
make Mention of.</P>
<P>I have read in some modern Au∣thor,
whose Name dos not occur to my
Memory, that this was, in his Opinion,
the most stupendous Miracle, that <HI>Jesus</HI>
wrought. And in truth it was a most
astonishing one, if literally true, and <HI>Jesus</HI>
must appear more than a Man, he must
put on an awful and most Majestick Coun∣tenance
to effect it. It is hard to con∣ceive,
how any one in the Form of a Man,
and of a despised one too, (and we don't
read that <HI>Jesus</HI> chang'd his human shape)
with a Whip in his Hand could execute
such a Work upon a great Multitude of
People; who were none of his Disciples,
nor had any regard for him. supposing he
could, by his divine Power infuse a <HI>Pannick</HI>
Fear into the People; yet what was the
Reason, that he was so <HI>eaten up</HI> with zeal
against the Profanation of that House,
which he himself came to destroy, and
which he permitted, I may say command∣ed
to be filthily polluted not long after.
Put not to form by my self an lnvective a∣gainst
the letter of this Story, let's hear what
the Fathers say to it.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="30"/>
<HI>Origen</HI> makes the whole but a <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">In Comment: in Matt. C. xxi.</NOTE> Pa∣rable.
His allegorical Expositions of it
are frequent; and one time or other he
gives us the mystical meaning of every
Part of it. By the Temple he understands
the Church. By the sellers in the Temple,
he means such Preachers, who make Mer∣chandise
of the Gospel, whom the Spirit
of Christ some Time or other would rid
his Church of. He is so far from believing
any Thing of the Letter of this Story, that
he has form'd a <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Porro cui curae est accuratior Inquisitio con∣siderabit, an juxta dignitatem praesentis Vitae erat, ut Jesus rem talem auderet facere, extrudere vide∣licet Mercatorum Multiudinem, qui ad Diem festum ascenderant, Distributuri boves ditioribus, et tanto populo oves mactandas per domos familiarium, quae multorum millium complerent numerum; atque eos qui in rebus talibus gloriantes producturi erant in medio Columbas, quas multi empturi erant, ceu in Conventu celeberrimo convivaturi. Considerabit hic etiam, an Nummulariorum erat non accusare Jesum contumeliose propter suas ipsorum effusas pecunias et mensas subversas. Quis antem flagello e funiculis verberatus et expulsus ab eo, qui penes eos habebatur vilis, hunc adortus non inclamasset totis viribus sese ulciscens? Cum praesertim haberet tantam multitudi∣nem eorum, qui sibi aeque contumeliam fieri credebant, faventem sibi adversum Jesum? Insuper censideremus, Dei filium funiculos sumentem; sibique flagellum tenentem ad extrudendum e templo, annon reprae∣sentet Praeter audaciam &amp; temeritatem, inordinatum etiam quiddam? In <HI>Johan.</HI> Tom. XI.</NOTE> large Argument a∣gainst
it: The substance of which is, that
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
if Jesus had attempted any such Thing,
the People would have resisted, and exe∣cuted
their Revenge on him; If he had ef∣fected
it, the Merchants of the Temple
might have reproach'd him with Damage
done to their Wares; and would have justly
accused him of a Riot against Law and
Authority. Whether there is not Reason
in this Argument of <HI>Origen,</HI> let any one
judge.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Hilary</HI> is of the same Mind with <HI>Ori∣gin.</HI>
He says that this Story is only a <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Praefiguratio futurorum dictis praesentibus continetur. In Matt. C. xxi.</NOTE> 
Praefiguration of what will be done in
Christ's Church upon another Occasion. And
he admonishes <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">Admonemur altius Verborum Virtutes in istius modi significationibus contuendas, <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> us to search into the
profound and mystical Import of every Part
of it. Particularly he hints that <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">In Cathedra est sacordotii sedes; et eorum qui Spiritus sancti Donum Venale habent, Cathedras evertet. Ibid.</NOTE> by
the Seats of those, who sell Doves, may
be understood the Pulpits of Preachers,
who make sale of the Gifts of the Spirit,
which is represented by a Dove. As to the
Letter of the Story, he is plain enough,
that there was no such <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Non habebant Judaei quod venire possent, neque erat quod emere quis posset. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> Market kept
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
in the Temple of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and if any
Historians besides the <HI>Evangelists</HI> had
as∣serted it, I know of none, who would have
been so foolish as to believe, that Oxen
and Sheep and Goats were there sold.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Ambrose</HI> too is for the Mystery and
against the Letter of this Story, saying,
 <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">Cathedra autem Vendentium Columbas cur everterit? secundum Litteram non intellgo. Ad∣monet. Typo ejectorum de Templo hujusmodi Mercatorum, in Ecclesia Dei Cousortium eos habere non posse, qui sancti Spiritus Gratiam nundinentur. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> what should be the Reason that Jesus
should overturn the Seats of those that sold
Doves? This must be, says he, a Figura∣tive
Story, and signifies nothing less than
the future Ejection of Priests out of his
Church, who shall make Gain and Mer∣chandise
of the Gospel.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> as his manner is in other
Cases, first gives us a Litteral Exposition
of this Miracle, as far as it will bear it:
But then corrects himself again, saying,
there are <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Juxta simplicem Intelligentim—quod pe∣nitus absurdum—caeterum secundum Mysticos In∣tellectus Jesus ingreditur Templum Patris et ejicit omnes Episcopos, Presbyteros et Diaconos, &amp;c. <HI>In Loc. Mat.</HI></NOTE> Absurditys in the Letter;
but, according to its Mystical Meaning,
Jesus will enter his Temple of the Church,
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
and cast out of it Bishops, Priests and Dea∣cons,
who make a Trade of Preaching.
and in another Place he tells us of the
Mystical <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Faciet Dominus Flagellum de Scripturarum Textuum Testinoniis. <HI>In Zechar:</HI> C. xiv.</NOTE> Whip, that Jesus will make use of to this Purpose.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Augustin</HI> also is against the Letter
of the Story of this Miracle saying, <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">Non magnum Peccatum, si hoc vendebant in Templo, quod emebatur, ut offerretur in Templo. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>where could be the great Sin of selling
and buying things in the Temple, that were
for the Use of it, and offer'd as Sacrifice in
it?</HI> We must therefore, says he look for
the Mystery in this <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Qui sunt tamen qui boves vendunt? ut in figura quaeramus Mysterium facti. qui sunt qui Oves vendunt et Columbas? ipsi sunt qui sua quaerunt in Ecclesia, non quae Jesu Christi. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> Figurative Story,
and enquire what is ment by the Oxen and
Sheep and Doves, and who are the sellers
of them in Christ's Church; and he is very
positive that Ecclesiasticks, who are selfish
and make Worldly Gain of the Gospel,
are here meant. And as to the Expression
of turning the Temple into a Den of
Theives, he says it has Respect: to the <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">Vox enim fecistis Domum meum, Domum Negotiationis etspeluncam Latronum, significat fu∣turos in Ecclesia. L. ii. <HI>Evang. Quaest. Quast.</HI> 48.</NOTE> 
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
Clergy in Time to come, who would make
such a Den of Christ's Church.</P>
<P>Lastly with the foregoing Fathers agrees
St. <HI>Theophylact,</HI> who is, an Allegorist too
upon this Miracle, saying that those, <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>In Johan.</HI> C. ii.</NOTE> 
who sell Doves, are the Priests, who sell
Spiritual Gifts, and that Christ sometime
or other would overturn their Seats, and
clear his Church of them. In another Place
he intimates, what are meant by Oxen
and Sheep, <HI>viz.</HI> the litteral Sence of the
Scriptures. And if the litteral Sence be
irrational and nonsensical, the Metaphor we
must allow to be proper, in as much as
now-a-days, dull and foolish and absurd
stuff we call Bulls, Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lings and Blunders.</P>
<P>Behold a wonderful Harmony among the
Fathers in their Rejection of litteral
and espousal of the mystical Sense of this
Miracle. It is said of the Church in her first
Ages, that she was inspir'd; and so she
was, or, before an Hire for the Priest∣hood
was established, and pleaded for, she
could never have written in this fashion.
If the Fathers had lived now, and written
thus, we should have thought the Spirit
of <HI>Quakerism</HI> was gotten amongst them,
or they would never have given such an Ex∣position
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
of this Story of favour an Enmity
to an Hireling Priesthood.</P>
<P>How and when Chris'sts Power according
to the Figure and Parable before us, will
enter his Church, and drive out of her these
Ecclesiastical Merchants, is not the Question.
But when ever it dos so effectually, it will
be a stupendous Miracle, Much greater
than the Typical one is supposed to be,
and not only a Proof of Christ's divine
Power and Presence in his Church, but an
absolute Demonstration of his <HI>Messiahship,</HI>
from his Accomplishment both of the fore∣said
Prophecys of the Fathers, and of other
remarkable Ones of the Old Testament,
which will be then clearly understood, and
which it is not my Business here to apply
or mention.</P>
<P>Against the aforesaid Exposition of this
Miracle perhaps it may be Objected, that
(excepting a little Reasoning against the
Letter of it) this is only the chimerical and
whimsical Dream of the Fathers, whose
Notions are obsolete, and who <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">Chandler's Vindication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 145.</NOTE> <HI>have
adulterated Christianity with their Cant and
Jargan,</HI> and that none of our Protestant and
Orthodox <HI>Divines</HI> have ever given into their Opinion.</P>
<P>I confess, that that none of our Protestant
<HI>Divines,</HI> whom I know, do embrace the
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
foresaid Exposition of the Fathers, but it
may be nothing the worse for all that:
And tho' their Exposition may be very
disagreeable to the Priesthood of this Age;
yet I can tell them of the greatest Man
of these last Ages, and that was <HI>Erasmus,</HI>
who, cautiously expressing himself for fear
of giving Offence to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> is of the
same Mind with the Fathers; or he would
not say that <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Hoc facto longe aliud significabat Jesus, nec enim illum tantopere commovebat Templum illud mercimoniis Boum, Ovium, Hircorum et Colum∣barum profanatum; sed oftendere voluit Avaritiam et Quaestum fore capitalem Pestem Ecclesiae, quam Templum, cujus Religio mox erat abolenda, figura∣bat—In nullum Hominum Genus acrius saeviit Je∣sus, sed hos ipse sibi servavit ejiciendos, cum videbi∣tur. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI> C. xxi.</NOTE> <HI>that Work of Jesus did
prefigure somewhat else. For Jesus could not
be zealous against the Profanation of that
Temple of the Jews, which was soon to be
destroy'd but meant to shew his dislike and
hatred of Ecclesiastical Covetousness, which,
after the Way of the Type, he would take his
Opportunity to rid the Church of.</HI></P>
<P>Before I dismiss this Miracle I must ob∣serve,
that if the Fathers are right above,
then out <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Translations
of the place in St. <HI>Matthew</HI> err in a main
Point. Instead of reading, <HI>and Jesus cast
out them, that sold and bought,</HI> it should be,
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
<HI>those who sold and preach'd,</HI> that is, sold
what they preach'd. For the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
do's more properly signifie to <HI>preach</HI> than
to <HI>buy</HI>; and in this sense here, according
to the Fathers, it should be construed.</P>
<P>Again, I must observe, that our Com∣mentators
are a little perplex'd to know
who and what those <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Money-Changers</HI>
were. The Greek <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Vid. Suicerum in <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> Word dos
import those who have a Knack to barter
away little base and brass Money, with the
Effigies of an Ox or Bull on it, in Ex∣change
for good Coin. How applicable
the Word was to any Merchants of the
old Temple at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is hard to con∣ceive.
But it is very agreeable to our
Ecclesiastical <HI>Collybists,</HI> who, as I may ap∣peal
to Freethinkers, vend their brasen∣faced
Bulls and Blunders at an extravagant
and great Price. And if <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which is
translated <HI>Tables,</HI> do's properly signifie <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> apud Aristophanem est Pulpitum. Vide Scapulam.</NOTE> 
<HI>Pulpits,</HI> who can help it?</P>
<P>So much then on the Miracle of Jesus's
driving the Sellersand Buyers out of the
Temple. And now I appeal to our <HI>Di∣vines,</HI>
whether it be not an absurd, im∣probable,
and incredible Story according
to the Letter, and whether it be any other,
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
than, as the Fathers said of it, a prophe∣tical
and parabolical Narative of what
would be mysteriously and more wonder∣fully
done by Jesus. And so I come to
speak to a</P>
<P N="2">2. Second Miracle of Jesus, and that is, that
of his <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">Matt. C. viii. Mark C. v. Luke C. viii.</NOTE> <HI>casting the Devils out of the Mad∣man
or Madmen, and permitting them to
enter into the Herd of Swine, which thereupon
ran down a Precipice and were all choaked
in the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>To exorcise or cast Devils out of the
Possess'd, without considering the Nature
of such a Possession, or the Nature and
Power of the Devil, we'll allow to be not
only a kind and beneficent Act, but a
great Miracle. But then, be the Miracle
as great as can be imagin'd, it is no more,
than what false Teachers, <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">Luke C. xiii. v. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Workers of
Iniquity,</HI> and even some Artists amongst
the <HI>Jews</HI> have before done, consequently
such a Work of <HI>Exorcism</HI> in our Saviour
could be no Proof of his Divine Autho∣rity.
And if there was no more to be
said against this Miracle; this is enough
to set it aside, and to spoil the Argument
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Divine Power from it. But
there are many Circumstances in the Story
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
litterally consider'd, that would induce us
to call the Truth of the Whole into Question.
How came those Madmen to have their
dwelling amongst the Tombs of a Burying
Ground? where was the Humanity of the
People, that did not take Care of them
in Pitty to them, as well as for the Safety
of others? Or if no Chains, as the Text
says, which is hardly credible, could hold
them, it was possible surely as well as law∣full
to dispatch them, rather than their
Neighbours and Passengers should be in
Danger from them. Believe then this Part
of the Story who can? But what's worse,
its not credible, there was any Herd of
<HI>Swine</HI> in that Country. If any Historians
but the <HI>Evangilists</HI> has said so, none would
have believed it. The <HI>Jews</HI> are forbidden
to eat Swines Flesh; what then should they
do with Swine which are good for nothing
till they are dead) who eat neither Pigg,
Pork nor Bacon? Some may say that they
were kept there for the Use of Strangers:
But this could not be; because that after
the Time of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> who polluted the
Temple with the Sacrifice of an Hog, the
<HI>Jews</HI> <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">Spencer. de Legibus Hebrae.p.117.</NOTE> forbid, under the Pain of an
<HI>Anathema,</HI> the keeping of any Swine in their
Country. Perhaps is may be said, that
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
the <HI>Gadarens,</HI> so call'd from the Place of
their Abode, were not <HI>Jews</HI> but neighbou∣ring
<HI>Gentiles,</HI> with whom it was lawful to
eat, and keep <HI>Swine.</HI> We will suppose so,
tho' it is improbable; but then, it's unlike∣ly
(without better Reason than at present
we are apprised of) that our Saviour would
permit the Devils to enter into a Herd of
them to their Destruction. Where was
the Goodness and Justice of his so doing?
Let our <HI>Divines</HI> account for it, if they can.
It is commonly said of our Saviour, and I
believe it, that his Life was entirely Inno∣cent,
that his Miracles were all useful and
beneficial to Maniind, and that he did no
Wrong to any one. But how can this be
rightly said of him, if this Story be litte∣rally
true? The Proprietors of the Swine
were great Losers and Sufferers; and we
don't read that <HI>Jesus</HI> make them amends,
or that they deserv'd such Usage from him.
The Proprietors of the Swine, it seems, up∣on
this Damage done them by <HI>Jesus.</HI> de∣sire
him to depart out of their Coasts, to pre∣vent
farther Mischief, which was gentler
Resentment, than we can imagine any o∣thers
would have made of the like Injury.
I know not what our Divines think of this
Part of the Story, nor wherefore Jesus
escaped so well; but if any <HI>Exorcist</HI> in this
our Age and Nation had pretended to ex∣pel
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
the Devil out of one possess'd, and per∣mitted
him to enter into a Flock of Sheep,
the People would have said, that he had
bewitch'd both; and our Laws and Judges
too of the last Age, would have made him
to swing for it.</P>
<P>Without Offence, I hope, I have argued
against the Letter of this strange Story of
the Holy Jesus; I should not have dared
to have said so much against it, but upon
the Encouragement of <HI>Origen</HI> and other Fa∣thers,
who say, we ought to expose the Ab∣surdities
of the Letter, as much as may
be, to turn Men's Heads to the mystical and
true meaning.</P>
<P>Let's hear then, what the Fathers say to
this Miracle. <HI>Origen</HI>'s Commentaries on
this Part of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s
Gospel are lost; otherwise unquestionably
he would not only have told us, that he
believed no more of the Letter of this Sto∣ry,
than he did of the Devil's <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">L. IV. <HI>De Principiis.</HI></NOTE> taking
our Saviour to the Top of a Mountain,
and shewing him all the Kingdoms of the
World; but, as he is an admirable <HI>My∣stist,</HI>
would have given us curious Light
into the Allegory and Mystery of it. But
without <HI>Origen,</HI> we have enough in the o∣ther
Fathers against the Letter of this Story.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="42"/>
St. <HI>Hilary</HI> reckoning up all the Parts of
this Miracle together, says of it, that it is
 <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Hanc habeant Causam, ut esset in rebus ge∣rendis futuri plena meditatio. <HI>In Loc.</HI> Matt. In hoc Typica ratio servata est. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> Typical and Parabolical, and written
for our Meditation of what would be done
hereafter by the Holy <HI>Jesus.</HI> According to
him, and other Fathers, the <HI>Madman</HI> is
Mankind, or if they were two, they were
<HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI> at Christ's coming, who
may be said to <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">Significatae sunt gentes quae multis daemonibus serviebant. <HI>Augustin in Luc. Quaest.</HI> 13.</NOTE> be <HI>possess'd with De∣vils,</HI>
in as much as they were under the
Rule of diabolical Sins, and subject to the
Worship of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> false Deities, which
we translate <HI>Devils.</HI> They were <HI>so fierce</HI>
 <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Humanum genus ad Adventum Domini vexa∣batur furore dementi, rumpens vincula rationis. St. <HI>Amb. in Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>as no Chains could hold them</HI>; because
of their most furious Rage and Enmity to
the Church, whom no Bonds of Reason
could restrain from doing Violence to the
Christians. They are said <HI>to be</HI> <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">Nudus quicunque tegumentum Naturae suae &amp; Virtutis amisit. <HI>Amb. Ibid.</HI></NOTE> <HI>na∣ked</HI>;
because they were destitute of the Clothing of the Spirit, and of Grace. And
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
may be said to be <HI>among the</HI> <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">In tumulis Sepulchrorum; quid enim aliud sunt Corpora perfidorum, nisi quaedam defunctorum Sepulchra in quibus Dei verbum non habitat. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tombs</HI>;
because they were dead in Trespasses and
Sins. After that <HI>Jesus</HI> had exorcis'd these
diabolical Spirits out of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and
brought them to their right Senses, which
was upon their Conversion to the Faith;
then a <HI>good Way off,</HI> some Ages after, did
the like <HI>Devils</HI> by Divine Permission enter
into a <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">Videntes Daemones non sibi jam locum in gen∣tibus derelinqui, ut patiatur habitare se in Haereticis deprecantur. <HI>Hilar. in Loc.</HI> Matt.</NOTE> <HI>Herd of Swine,</HI> i e. into <HI>Here∣ticks</HI>
of impure Lives and furious Natures.
What sort of <HI>Hereticks</HI> are meant, or whe∣ther
they are not to be understood of Chri∣stians
in general, let our <HI>Divines</HI> consider.
But one would be apt to think that <HI>Mini∣sters
of the Letter</HI> are included, <NOTE N="52" PLACE="foot">Littera est Palea, &amp; frequenter evenit, ut ho∣mines hujus soeculi mystica nescientes, simplici Scrip∣turarum Lectione pascuntur. <HI>Hieron. in</HI> Isa. c. xi.</NOTE> be∣cause,
the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Scripture is mysti∣cally
call'd <HI>Swines</HI> Food. I am not obli∣ged
to pursue the mystical Interpretation
of this Parable (for so I will call it) thro'
all its Parts, nor to say what is meant by
the Sea, that the <HI>Swine</HI> are to be absorp't
in: But leave our <HI>Divines</HI> to chew upon
this mystical Construction given them in
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
part, and to consider, whether there's not
a Necessity for such an Interpretation to
make the Story credible.</P>
<P>And thus have I given you the Opinion
and Exposition of the Fathers upon this
Miracle, which they turn all into Mystery.
If our <HI>Divines</HI> are still for adhering to the
Letter of this Story, let them Account for
the Difficulties, it is involv'd with. To
cure Men violently distracted, and pos∣sess'd
with <HI>Devils</HI> is, whether it be mira∣culous
or not, a good and great Work;
but to send the <HI>Devils,</HI> who without <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Permission could not go, into the
<HI>Herd of Swine,</HI> was an Injury done to the
Proprietors, and unbecoming of the Good∣ness
of the Holy Jesus. Neither is there
any other Way to solve the Difficulty,
than by looking upon the Whole, with
the Fathers, as Type and Figure.</P>
<P>If this Miraculous Story had been re∣corded
of <HI>Mahomet</HI> and not of <HI>Jesus</HI>; our
<HI>Divines,</HI> I dare say, would have work'd
it up to a Confutation, of <HI>Mahometanism.
Mahomet</HI> should have been, with them,
nothing less than a Wizard, an Enchanter,
a dealer with familiar Spirits, a sworn slave
to the Devil; and his <HI>Mussulmen</HI> would
have been hard put to it to write a good
Defence of him.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45"/>
When our Saviour was brought before
<HI>Pilate</HI> to be arraign'd, try'd, and condem'd,
<HI>Pilate</HI> put this Question to the <HI>Jews,</HI> saying
<HI>what evil hath Jesus done</HI>? If both or either
of the Stories above had been litterally
true of <HI>Jesus,</HI> there had been no need of
false Witnesses against him. The Merchants
of the Temple were at hand, who could
have sworn "that he was the Author of
an Uproar, and Riot, the like was never
seen on their Market-day; that they were
great Sufferers and Losers in their Trades;
and, whether he or his Party had stolen
any of their Goods or not, yet some
were embezzled and others damag'd;
and all through the outragious Violence
of this unruly Fellow against Law and
Authority," If such Evidence as this
was not enough to convict him of a Capi∣tal
Crime; then the <HI>Swine-Herds</HI> of the
<HI>Gadarenes</HI> might have deposed, how they
"believed him to be a <HI>Wizard</HI> and had
lost two thousand Swine through his
Falcinations. That he bid the Divels
to go into our Cattle is not to be de∣ny'd.
And if he cured one or two of
our Countrymen of a violent Possession;
yet in as much as he did us this Injury
in our Swine, we justly suspect him of
Diabolical Practises upon both."</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="46"/>
Upon such Evidence as this, <HI>Pilate</HI> asks
the Opinion of Jews, saying, <HI>what think
you</HI>? If they all had condemn'd him to
be guilty of Death, it is no wonder, since
there is not a <HI>Jury</HI> in <HI>England</HI> would
have acquitted any one arraign'd and Ac∣cused
in the like Case.</P>
<P>It is well for our litteral <HI>Doctors,</HI> that
such Accusations were not brought against
<HI>Jesus</HI>; or their Heads would have been
sadly puzzled to vindicate his Innocence,
and to prove the Injustice and Undeserved∣ness
of his Death and Sufferings. But
for this Reason, if no other, that no such
Crimes were laid to his Charge, I believe
little or nothing of either of the seemingly
miraculous Storys before us; but look upon
them both, as Prophetical and Parabolical
Narratives of what would mysteriously and
more wonderfully, and consistently with
the Wisdom and Goodness of <HI>Jesus,</HI> be done
by him. And so I pass to a</P>
<P N="3">3. Third Miracle of Jesus, and that is
<HI>his Transfiguration</HI> <NOTE N="53" PLACE="foot">Matt. C. xvii. Mark C. ix. Luke C. ix.</NOTE> <HI>on the Mount.</HI> And
this is the darkest and blindest Story of the
whole Gospel, which a Man can make nei∣ther
Head nor Foot of; and I question
whether the Conceptions of any two
thinking <HI>Doctors</HI> do agree about it. To say
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
there is nothing in the Letter of this Story,
we Believers must not; because St. <HI>Peter</HI>
 <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">ii Peter Cap. i. v. 16, 17, 18.</NOTE> says, he was an Eye-witness of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Majesty, saw his Glory on the Mount, and
heard the Voice out of the Cloud. But as
Infidels will be prying into the Conduct of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Life and forming their Exceptions
to the Credibility or Probability of this or
that Part of it; so we Christians should
be ready at an Answer, that might reason∣ably
satisfy them; and not forcibly bear
down their Opposition, which will make
no sincere Converts of them. And I be∣lieve
they would easily distress us with
Difficultys and Objections to the Letter
of this Story.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Augustin</HI> himself <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot">Possunt Infideles istam Vocem delatam de Caelo, per conjecturas humanas et illicitas Curiositates ad magicas Artes referre. <HI>In Sermon.</HI> xliii. <HI>sect.</HI> 5.</NOTE> owns, that the
whole of it might be perform'd by Magic
Art; And we know, in these our Days
that some Jugglers are strange Artists at
the imitation of a Voice, and to make it
as if it came from a far of, when it is ut∣tered
close by us; and can cast themselves
too into different forms and shapes, with∣out
a Miracle, to the Surprise and Admi∣ration
of spectators.</P>
<P>But what, I trow, do our <HI>Divines</HI> mean
by <HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>Transfiguration.</HI> We read that
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
his Countenance did shine like the Sun,
and his Rayment was made as white as
Snow, and that's all. And is this enough
can we think to demonstrate that Trans∣action,
a Miraclous <HI>Transfiguration?</HI> Phy∣losophers
will tell us, that the Reflections
of the Light of the Sun will change the
Appearance of Colours, and to none more
than whiteness; And <HI>Sceptics</HI> will say that
its no wonder if the Countenance of Jesus
look'd <HI>Rubicund</HI> when the Sun might shine
on it.</P>
<P>The Word in the Original for transfi∣gured
is <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that is, he was meta∣morphosed,
transform'd or if you will
transfigured. And what is to be understood
by a <HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> we are to learn not only
from the natural Import of the Word but
from the ancient use of it. Accordingly
it signifies nothing less than the Change
or Transformation of a Person into the
Forms, Shapes and Essences of Creatures
and Things of a quite different Species,
Size and Figure. But <HI>Jesus,</HI> it is conceived,
was not so <HI>transfigured.</HI> Our Divines, I
suppose would not have him thought such
a <HI>Posture-Master</HI> for the whole World. If
I or any one else should assert, that Jesus
upon the Mount transform'd himself into
a Calf, a Lyon, a Bear, a Ram, a Goat,
an Hydra, a Stone, a Tree, and into many
<PB N="42" REF="49" MS="y"/>
other things of the animate and inanimate
World, I dare say there would, among our
Orthodox Divines, be such Exclamations
against me for Blasphemy, as the like were
never heard of. They, to be sure will not
hear of such a Transfiguration; nor, like good
plain Believers, will bear any thing more
than that Jesus's <HI>Countenance did shine</HI> like
the Sun, and the Colour of his Countenance
was changed; which whether it comes up
to the import of a <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> or not,
they dont care.</P>
<P>But to close with our Divines, and ac∣knowledge,
that the glorious Change of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Countenance, and of the Colour of
his Vestments was a true and proper Trans∣siguration,
and that it was as real and
wonderful a Miracle as could be wrought;
But then we may, I hope, ask them, what
was the particular Reason and Use of this
Miracle? Was it a Miracle only for the
sake of a Miracle? That's an Absurdity in
the Opinion of <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Neque enim Miracula propter Miracula fa∣ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/>, sed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> illa quae faciebat, miraessent videntibus, vera essent intelligentibus. <HI>In Serm.</HI> xcviii. <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE> St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> who says,
what is reasonable to think, that all and
every one of Jesus's Miracles had its par∣ticular
End and Use; or he who is the
Wisdom as well as Power of God had ne∣ver
wrought it. And what, I pray was the
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
Use of this Miracle? Of that the Evan∣gelical
History is silent; and our Divines
with all their Reasoning Facultys can say
nothing to it.</P>
<P>And what did <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> on the
Mount with Jesus? was it in their own
proper Persons that they appear'd? or were
they only some Specters and Apparitions
in Resemblance of them? It is said, that
they were talking with <HI>Jesus</HI>; what then
did they talk about? The three greatest
Prophets and Philosophers of the Universe
could not possibly meet and confer together,
but on the most sublime, useful, and edify∣ing
Subject. It's strange, that the Apostles,
who over-heard their Confabulation, did
not make a Report of it, and transmit it to
Posterity for our Edification and Instruction.
St. <HI>Luke,</HI> as our <HI>English</HI> Translation has it,
seems to say that they talk'd together of
Jesus's <HI>Decease which he should accomplish
at Jerusalem,</HI> but this can't be the meaning of
St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. C. ix. V. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>1.</NOTE> Words, which so interpreted,
are no less than a <HI>Barbarism,</HI> and. I appeal
to our Greek Critics, an improper Ex∣pression
of such signification. We must
then look for a more proper Construction
of the Phrase in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> or we must re∣main
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
in the dark, as to the Subject, that
<HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> talked with Jesus about.</P>
<P>But further, why could not this Mira∣cle
have been wrought in the Valley as
well as upon a Mountain, whither Jesus
and his three Apostles ascended for the
Work of it? Naughty Infidels will say, it
was for the Advantage of a Cloud, which
often moves and rests on the Tops of
Mountains, to display his Pranks in. And
why was it not done in the Presence of
the Multitude, as well as of his three A∣pustles?
The more Witnesses of a Mira∣cle,
the better it is attested, and the more
reasonably Credited; and there could not
surely be too many Witnesses of this, any
more than of others of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles, if
real ones. Ought not the unbelieving
Multitude, for many Unbelievers unque∣stionably
were amongst them, to have had
a Sight and Hearing of this Miracle, as
well as the Apostles? Who should rather
see the Miracle, than those who wanted
Conviction? Were they to take the Re∣port
of the Miracle upon the Word of
the Apostles, who were Partys in the
Cause? Our Divines may possibly say
they ought: But Infidels and Free Think∣ers
would cry out against them, for jug∣gling
Tricks, and pious Impostures.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="52"/>
These are all Difficultys and hard Que∣stions
about the Miracle of Christ's Trans∣figuration,
which our <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are Ad∣mirers
of the Letter of that Story are ob∣liged
to Account for; and I believe it
will be long enough, before they give a
proper and satisfactory Answer to many
of them.</P>
<P>Let's hear then what the Fathers say to
this miraculous Story of Jesus's Transfigu∣ration.
And it is agreed amongst them,
that the whole is, but a Type, <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">Regni coelestis Honor praefiguratur. St. <HI>Hi∣lar. in Loc.</HI> Matt. In Transfiguratione futura Regni Praemeditatio &amp; Gloria demonstrata est. St. <HI>Hierom. in Loc.</HI> Matt.</NOTE> Prefi∣guration,

of a future and more glorious and
real Transfiguration. And whenever they
speak of any Part of the Story, they ne∣ver
explain to us, how the Matter went
upon Mount <HI>Tabor</HI>; but tell us, of what
this or that Part of it is Figurative and
Emblematical; and how it is to be un∣derstood,
and will be fulfill'd in future
Time. As thus, by <HI>the</HI> <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">Sex millium scilicet Annorum Temporibus e∣volutis. St. <HI>Hilar. in Loc.</HI> Matt. Sic post Sex aetates Do∣minus a perfectis Famulis conspicietur. <HI>Dionys. Alex. apud Damascen. in Orat. de Transfig.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Six Days,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
they under&amp;stand six Ages of the World,
after which a real and mysterious Trans∣figuration
will be exhibited to our intelle∣ctual
Views. By <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Et Moses &amp; Elias apparuerunt in Gloria, cum Jesu colloquentes, in quo ostenditur Legem &amp; Pro∣phetas, cum Evangeliis consonare &amp; in eadem Gloria spiritualis intelligentiae refulgere. <HI>Origen. in Epist. ad</HI> Rom. c. 1.</NOTE> 
talking with <HI>Jesus,</HI> they mean the Law
and the Prophets, upon an Allegorical
Interpretation, bearing Testimony unto
Christ, as the Fulfiller of them. By the
 <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">Montem ascendit ut te doceat, ne quaeras eum nisi in Legem &amp; Prophetarum montibus. <HI>Origen. in Cantic. Cantic. Hom.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>Mountain</HI> on which this future Trans∣figuration
will be exhibited, they under∣s;tand
the sublime and anagogical Sense of
the Law and the Prophets. By his Trans∣figuration
it self, they mean his taking
upon him, and passing through the Forms
of all the Types of him under the Law,
as of a Lamb, a Lion, a Serpent, a Calf,
a Rock, a Stone, and of many others,
which he is to fulfil, and which will
then be clearly discern'd by us. By the
black Cloud <NOTE N="63" PLACE="foot">Per nubem tetram intellige opacitatem Legis. <HI>Damascen. in Orat. de Transfigur.</HI></NOTE> that at present ob∣structs
this Vision, they understand the
Letter of the Old Testament. By the

white <NOTE N="64" PLACE="foot">Vestimenta candida Jesu sunt Sermones &amp; Scripta Evangeliorum. <HI>Origen. in Loc.</HI> Matt.</NOTE> Vestments of Jesus, they mean
the Words of the Scriptures, which will
then shine clear and bright. By the Voice
out of the Cloud, they mean with St. <HI>Pe∣ter,</HI>
the Word of Prophecy, that will sound
in the Ears of our Apprehensions. And
lastly, they tell us, that the Way to at∣tain
to the Sight of this glorious Vision,
is by ascending (not by local Motion, but
by Reason) to the Tops of the Mountain
of the mysterious and sublime Sense of
the Law and the Prophets. If we conti∣nue
in the Plains and Valley <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">Si quis Litteram sequitur, &amp; deorsum est to∣tus, hic non potest videre Jesum in veste candida; qui autem sequitur Sermonem Dei &amp; ad montana, id est, excelsa Legis conscendit, isti Jesus commutatur.—Quamdiu Litteram sequimur occidentem, Moses &amp; Elias cum Jesu non loquuntur; sin spiritualiter in∣telligimus, statim Moses &amp; Elias veniunt, id est Lex &amp; Prophetae &amp; colloquuntur cum Evangelie. <HI>Johan.

Letter, like the Multitude under the Moun∣tain,
we shall never see Jesus in his shi∣ning
Vestments, nor how he was trans∣form'd
into the Types of the Law, nor
<HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> talking with him; not
the Law and the Prophets agreeing har∣moniously
in a Testimony to him.</P>
<P>After this Fashion do the Fathers, one or
other of them, Copiously Treat on every
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
Part of this Transfiguration of Jesus. I
could collect an almost infinite Number of
Passages out of their Writings to this Pur∣pose:
But from these few it is plain, they
look'd on the Story of Christ's Transfigu∣ration,
but as a Figure and Parable; and
they were certainly in the right on't, in as
much as this their Sense of the Matter and
no other, will solve the Difficultys before
started against the Letter, as any one may
discern if he attentively review and com∣pare
one with the other; As for Instance;
this their Sense and Interpretation lets us
into the Reason of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias's</HI> ap∣pearing
on the Mount with Jesus; and
gives us to understand what they talk'd
about, and that was, not on Jesus's <HI>Decease
which he would accomplish at Jerusalem,</HI> as
our Translation has it, but on the Pro∣phecy
of the old Testament; particularly,
as St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, on Mose's <HI>Book of Exodus,</HI>
<HI>and how he would fulfill it</HI> at the New Je∣rusalem.</P>
<P>Whether any, besides my self, do's really
apprehended and is willing to understand this
Story of Christ's Transfiguration, as I do, I
neither know nor care. I am not bound to
find others, Ears, Eyes, and Capacitys. What
I have said is enough to shew the Sense of
the Fathers about this Matter. If any dislike
their concurrent Opinions of Jesus's Trans∣figuraton's
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
being an Emblem, an Enigma,
and Figurative Representation of a Future
and most Glorious Transfiguration, such a
one as they speak of; let him account for
the Difficultys and Objections, which I have
before raised against the Letter of this Story.
In the mean Time I shall think it, litterally,
an absurd, improbable, and incredible one,
and no other than a Prophetical and Para∣bolical
Narrative of what will be Mysteri∣ously
and more wonderfully done by <HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have consider'd Three of the
Miracles of our Saviour, and shewn how
they are Absurdities, according to the Let∣ter,
consequently do make nothing for his
Authority and Messiahship. I can and will
do as much by his other Miracles; for I
would not have any one think, I am got∣ten
to the End of my Tedder, but for some
Reasons best known to my self, I publish
these Remarks on these three first. After the
Clergy have chew'd upon these a while, I
will take into Examination some others of
<HI>Jesus's</HI> Miracles, which for their litteral Story
are admired by them. As for Instance
I will take to task his Miracle <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">John Cap. ii.</NOTE> <HI>of
changing Water into Wine at a Marriage in
Cana of Galilee</HI>; which was the beginning of
<HI>Jesus's</HI> Miracles, and should by right have
been first spoken to; but I am almost too
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
grave to handle the Letter of this Story as I
ought; and if I had treated it as ludicrous∣ly
as it deserves, I don't know, but at set∣ting
out, I should have put the <HI>Clergy</HI> quite
out of all Temper I would not now for the
World be so impious and prophane, as to
believe, with out <HI>Divines,</HI> what is contain'd
and imply'd in the Letter of this Story. If
<HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</HI> and not <HI>Jesus,</HI> had been
the Author of this Miracle, we should often
have reproached his Memory with it. It
is said of <HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</HI> that a Table
was all on a sudden, at his Command, mira∣culously
spread with variety of nice Dishes
for the Entertainment of himself and his
Guests; which Miracle, our <HI>Divines</HI> can
tell him makes not at all to his Credit, in
as much as it was done for the service and
pleasure of luxurious Appetites. But if <HI>Apol∣lonius</HI>
had done, as our <HI>Jesus</HI> did at this
Wedding, they would have said much
worse of him; and that modestly speaking,
he delighted to make his Friends thoroughly
merry, or he would not be at the Pains of
a Miracle to turn so much Water into
Wine, after they had before <HI>well drank.</HI>
If the Fathers then don't help us out at
the mystical and true meaning of this Mi∣racle,
such farther Objections may be
form'd against the Letter, as may make
our Divines asham'd of it.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="58"/>
I will also take into Examination <HI>Jesus's</HI>
Miracles <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">Matt. c. xiv. and xv, &amp;c.</NOTE> of <HI>feeding many thousands in
the Wilderness with a few Loaves and Fishes,</HI>
which according to the Letter are most to∣mantick
Tales. I don't in the least question
<HI>Jesus's</HI> Power to magnifie or multiply the
Loaves, and, if he pleas'd to meliorate the
Bread. But that many thousands of Men,
Women and Children should follow him
into the Wilderness, and stay with him
three Days and Nights too, without eating,
is a little against Sense and Reason. Whether
the Wilderness was near to, or far from
the Peoples Habitations, the difficultys at∣tending
the Story are equally great. I
wonder how <HI>Jesus</HI> amused them all the
while, that they had the Patience to stay
with him without Food; But I much more
wonder, that no Victualers besides the <HI>Lad</HI>
with his Loaves and Fishes, of whom, and
his Occupation, whether it was that of a
<HI>Baker</HI> or <HI>Fishmonger</HI>; and of his neglect of
his Master's Business here; and of the Rea∣son,
that he met with no hungry Chapmen
for his Bread before, we shall make some
Enquiry; but particurly why he alone, I
say, and no other Victualers, no other Re∣talers
of Cakes and Gingerbread followed
the Camp. In short, for all the imaginary
greatness of the Miracle (which there is a
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
way to reduce and lessen) of Jesus's feeding
his thousands with a few Loaves, there must
be some Fascination or Enchantment (con∣demn'd
by the Laws of the <HI>Jews</HI> as well as
of other Nations) in the Matter; or the
People, if they had stay'd one Day, would
not two, much less three <HI>to faint,</HI> but
would, especially the Women and Children
have been for returning, the first Night,
home. We must then seek to the Fathers
(who say the five Books of <HI>Moses</HI> are the five
Barley Loaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the septiform'd Spi∣rit,
the seven Loaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) for a good No∣tion
of this Miracle, and if they don't make
it a Parable; do what our Divines can, it
will turn to the dishonour of the Holy Jesus.</P>
<P>I will also consider the Miracle of Jesus's
 <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">Mark Cap. ii. Luke C. v.</NOTE> <HI>curing the Man sick of the Palsy, for
whom the Roof of the House was broken
up, to let him down into the Room where
Jesus was, because his Bearers could not enter
in at the Door for the Press of the People.</HI>
This Litterally is such a <HI>Rodomontado,</HI> that
were Men to stretch, for a wager, against
Reason and Truth, none could out-doe it.
Where was the Humanity of the People,
and wherefore did they so tumultuate a∣gainst
the Door of the House? It's
<HI>strange</HI> they had not so much Compassion
on the <HI>Paralytick,</HI> as to give Way to him:
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
It's <HI>more strange,</HI> that his Bearers could get
to the Top of the House with him and
his Bed too, when they could not get to
the Door, nor the Sides of it: It's <HI>yet
stranger,</HI> that the good Man of the House
would suffer his House to be broken up,
when it could not be long, 'ere the Tu∣mult
of the People would be appeas'd:
But most <HI>strange,</HI> that <HI>Jesus,</HI> who could
drive his thousands out of the Temple be∣fore
him, and draw as many after him in∣to
the Wilderness, did not, by Force or
Perswasion, make the People to retreat, but
that such needless Trouble and Pains must
be taken for the miraculous Cure of this
poor Man. Let's think of these Things a∣gainst
the Time, that out of the Fathers I
prove this Story to be a Parable.</P>
<P>I will also take into Consideration the
Miracle of <HI>Jesus's</HI> curing <HI>the</HI> <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">John Cap. ix.</NOTE> <HI>Blind
Man, for whom Eye-Salve was made of Clay
and Spittle</HI>; which Eye-Salve, whether it
was balsamick or not, do's equally affect
the Credit of the Miracle. If it was na∣turally
medicinal, there's an End of the Mi∣racle;
and if it was not at all medicinal,
it was foolishly and impertinently ap∣ply'd,
and can be no otherwise accounted
for, than by considering it, with the Fa∣thers,
as a figurative Act in Jesus.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="61"/>
I will also take into Consideration the
several Stories of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s raising of the dead;
and, without questioning his actual bring∣ing
of the Dead to Life again, will prove
from the Circumstances of those Storys,
that they are parabotical, and are not lit∣terally
to be apply'd to the Proof of Jesus<HI>'s</HI>
Divine Authority and Messiahship; or, for
Instance, <HI>Jesus,</HI> when he raised <HI>Jarius's</HI> <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">Mark. Cap. v.</NOTE> 
Daughter from the dead, would never have
turned the People out of the House, who
should have been his best and properest Wit∣nesses.</P>
<P>I will also Consider the Miracle of Je∣sus'<HI>s</HI>
 <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Matt. Cap. xxi. Mark. Cap. xi.</NOTE> <HI>Cursing the Fig-Tree,</HI> for its not
bearing Fruit out of Season; which, upon
the bare mention of it, appears to be a
foolish, absurd, and ridiculous Act, if not
figurative.</P>
<P>I will also consider the <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Matt. Cap. ii.</NOTE> Journey of the
Wisemen out of the East, with their (litte∣rally)
senseless and ridiculous Presents of
<HI>Frankincence</HI> and <HI>Myrrhe</HI> to a new-born
Babe. If with their <HI>Gold,</HI> which could be but
little, they had brought their Dozens of Su∣gar,
Soap, and Candles, which would have
been of use to the Child and his poor Mo∣ther
in the Straw, they had acted like
wise as well as good Men. But what, I
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
pray, was the Meaning and Reason of a
Star, like a <HI>Will a Whisp,</HI> for their Guide
to the Place, where the Holy Infant lay.
Could not God by Divine Impulse, in a
Vision or in a Dream, as he ordered their
Return Home, have sent them on this im∣portant
Errand; but that a Star must be
taken or made out of Course to this Pur∣pose?
I wonder what Communication pas∣sed
between these Wise Men and the Star,
or how they came to know one another's
Use and Intention. But the Fathers shall
speak hereafter farther to the senselesness
of this Story litterally; and make out the
Mystery and true meaning of it.</P>
<P>I will also, by the Leave of our <HI>Divines,</HI>
take again into Consideration the miracu∣lous
Conception of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI>
and the Resurrection of <HI>Jesus</HI> from the
Dead. I do believe, if it may so please
our <HI>Divines,</HI> that <HI>Jesus</HI> was born of a
pure Virgin, and that he arose from the
Dead; but speaking too briefly, in the
<HI>Moderator,</HI> to these two Miracles, they took
Offence. I will therefore give them a
Review, and speak Home to them; par∣ticularly
to Christ's Resurrection, the E∣vangelical
Story of which litterally, is
such a Complication of Absurditys, In∣coherences,
and Contradictions, that un∣less
the Fathers can help us to a better
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
Understanding of the <HI>Evangelists</HI> than we
have at present, we must of Necessity give
up the Belief of it.</P>
<P>These and many <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">Alia quam plurima his similia in Evangeliis inveniet, quicunque attentius legerit. <HI>Origen. de Principiis,</HI> L. iv.</NOTE> other of the hi∣storical
and miraculous Parts of Jesus's
Life, will I take into Examination, and
shew, that none of them litterally do
prove his Divine Authority, so far from
it, that they are full of Absurdities, Im∣probabilities
and Incredibilities; but that
his whole Life in the Flesh, is but <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Quae Enarratio erit Evangelii sensibilis, nisi accommodetur ad intelligibile &amp; spirituale? Nulla sane. <HI>Origen. in Praefat. ad Johan. Evang.</HI></NOTE> 
Type, Figure and Parable of his myste∣rious
and spiritual Life and Operations in
Mankind.</P>
<P>In the end of this Head, it will be a
curious and diverting Subject to examine
the Miracles of Jesus, as they are litte∣rally
understood, by the Notions, which
our <HI>Divines</HI> have advanced about Mira∣cles;
and to shew, that even their Noti∣ons
compared with Christ's Miracles, are
destructive of his Authority, and subver∣sive
of Christianity. This, I say, would
be a most diverting Undertaking, and it
will be strange, if some <HI>Free-Thinker,</HI> that
loves Pleasure of this kind, do's not take
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
the hint and snatch the Work out of my
Hands. If I do it ray self, I shall have espe∣cial
regard to the Writers against the
<HI>Grounds,</HI> without passing by Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s
Essay on Miracles, on which the more
Remarks will be made, if it be but to pay
my Respects to the <HI>Arch Bishop</HI>'s Judg∣ment,
and to shew my Admiration at those
extravagant Praises, which his <HI>Grace</HI> at
<HI>Lambeth</HI> has bestow'd on that Author. A∣mong
other his notable Notions of a Mi∣racle
(and the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> says, he has
 <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">See Arch-Bishop <HI>Wake</HI>'s Manuscript Letter to Mr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> which is handed about Town and Coun∣try.</NOTE> <HI>set the Notion of a Miracle upon a
clear and sure Foundation</HI>) one is, <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Chandler'<HI>s Vindication,</HI> &amp;c. Page 81.</NOTE> 
<HI>That Miracles should be Things probable as
well us possible, that they do not carry along
with them the Appearance of Romance and
Fable, which would unavoidably prejudice Men
against believing them.</HI> This is certainly a
good and right Notion of a Divine Mira∣cle;
and I don't doubt, but according to
it, Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> and the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> think,
they can justifie the litteral Story of our
Saviour's Miracles, against the Charge of
<HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Romance:</HI> But whether they are
able to do it or not; I shall go on, in
some Discourses hereafter to be publish'd,
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
to prove, that our <HI>Divines,</HI> by espousing
the Letter of Christ's Miracles, have decei∣ved
themselves into the Belief of the most
arrant <HI>Quixotism,</HI> that can be devised and
palm'd upon the Understandings of Man∣kind.
I say they have deceived them∣selves;
for neither the Fathers, nor the A∣postles,
nor even <HI>Jesus</HI> himself meant that
his Miracles, as recorded in the <HI>Evange∣lists,</HI>
should be taken in a litteral Sense,
but in <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">Dominus noster ea quae faciebat corporaliter, etiam spiritualiter volebat intelligi, <HI>&amp;c. August. Serm.</HI> xcviii. Sect. 3.</NOTE> a mystical, figurative and pa∣rabolical
One. And this should bring me
to the</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>III. Head of my Discourse, that is, to
consider what <HI>Jesus</HI> means, when he ap∣peals
to his Works and Miracles, as to a
Witness and Testimony of his Divine Au∣thority;
and to shew, that he could not
properly and truly refer to those supposed
to be wrought by him in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> but to
those mystical Ones, he would do in the
<HI>Spirit,</HI> of which those seemingly wrought
by him in the Flesh, are but Types and
Shadows.</P>
<P>But this Head can't be rightly spoken to,
till I have more amply discuss'd the Form∣er,
which by God's leave I Promise to do:
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
And if my <HI>Curteous Readers,</HI> will be so
kind as to trust me till that Time, I assure
them to prove, that no Ignorance and Stu∣pidity
can be greater, than the Imaginati∣on,
that <HI>Jesus</HI> really appeal'd to his Mira∣cles,
supposed to have been wrought by
him in the Flesh, as to a Witness and
Testimony of his Divine Authority, and Messiahship.</P>
<P>In the mean Time our Divines may go
on in their own Way, if they think fit,
and admire <HI>Jesus</HI> of old, and celebrate his
Power and Praises for healing of bodily
Diseases, and doing other notable Feats
according to the Letter of the Evangeli∣cal
Story; but I am for the spirirual <HI>Je∣sus</HI> and <HI>Messiah,</HI>
who cures the worse <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">Quos in corporibus morbos sanavit Christus, hi in animabus existunt, &amp; supernam ejus opem re∣quirunt. <HI>Johan. Nepot. Hieros.</HI> Hom. LXI.</NOTE> 
Distempers of the Soul, and do's other myste∣rious
and most miraculous Works, of which
those recorded in the Evangelists are but
Figure and Parable. This is the Primitive
and concurrent Opinion about the true
Messiah, which the Fathers universally ad∣her'd
to. Whether our <HI>Jesus,</HI> at this Day,
be such a spiritual <HI>Messiah</HI> to his Church,
or whether she do's not stand in need of
such a one, is the Question that our Di∣vines
are to see to. But I will add here,
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
what I believe, and shall have another Op∣portunity
to prove, that God on purpose
suffer'd or empower'd <HI>false,</HI> as well as <HI>true</HI>
Prophets; <HI>bad</HI> as well us <HI>good</HI> Men, such as
<HI>Apollonius, Vespasian,</HI> and many others to
cure Diseases, and to do other mighty
Works, equal to what are literally report∣ed
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> not only to defeat us of all
Distinction between true and false Miracles,
which are the Object of our bodily Senses,
but to raise and keep up our Thoughts to
the constant Contemplation of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s spi∣ritual,
mysterious, and most miraculous
Works, which are the Object of our
Understandings, and loudly bespeak the
Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, and
which are to be the absolute Demonstration
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Divine Authority and Messiahship
to the Conversion of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels.</HI></P>
<P>I have no more to do at present, but,
like a <HI>Moderator,</HI> to conclude with a short
Address and Exhortation, to <HI>Infidels</HI> and
<HI>Apostates,</HI> the two contending Partys in
the present Controversy. And</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> To <HI>Apostates,</HI> I mean the Writers
against the <HI>Grounds</HI> and <HI>Scheme.</HI> Whether
you, <HI>Grave Sirs,</HI> who account your selves
Orthodox <HI>Divines,</HI> tho' there is little but
Contradiction and Inconsistency amongst
you, do like the Name of <HI>Apostates</HI> which
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
is given you, I much Question: But it is
the properest, I could think of, for your
Desertion of Primitive Doctrine about Pro∣phecy
and Miracles. I could, not im∣properly,
have given you a worse <HI>Title,</HI>
but I was willing to Compliment you, ra∣ther
than Reproach you wish this.</P>
<P>But setting aside the Title of <HI>Apostates,</HI>
whether it be, in your Opinion, opprobi∣ous
or not; you may plainly perceive,
that I am, <HI>Sirs,</HI> on your side, as to the
Truth of Christianity, and if you'll accept
of my Assistance, for the Proof of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Messiahship from Prophecy, upon the Terms
of the Allegorical Scheme proposed in my
<HI>Moderator,</HI> you shall find me your hearty
Abettor. Upon the Allegorical Scheme I
don't doubt, but we shall soundly drub and
maul <HI>Infidels,</HI> and beat them out of the
Field of Battle. If you, being wedded to
the litteral Scheme, will not accept of
my Assistance, you may go on in your
own Way, and see the Event of the Con∣troversy,
which in the End will turn to
your Dishonour.</P>
<P>You, <HI>Sirs,</HI> can't but be sensible, how
those two great Generals, Mr. <HI>Grounds,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Scheme,</HI> with their potent Armies
of Reasons, and Authorities against your
litteral Prophecies, have greivously distress'd
and gall'd you; and, if you don't make an
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
honourable Retreat in Time, and seek to
<HI>Allegorists</HI> for help, will gain a compleat
Victory, and Triumph over you.</P>
<P>Instead of the help of <HI>Allegorists,</HI> you,
I find, under the Disappointment of your
litteral Scheme, chuse rather to have Re∣course
to <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles: But what little
Dependance there is upon his Miracles, in
your Sense, I have in <HI>Part</HI> proved in this
Discourse; and this I have done (give me
leave repeatedly to declare it) not for the
Service of your unbelieving Adversaries,
but to reduce you to the good old Way of
interpreting Oracles, which, upon the Te∣stimony
of the Fathers, will, one Day, be
the Conversion of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>Whether you, <HI>Sirs,</HI> will be pleas'd with
this short Discourse on Christ's Miracles,
I much Question. But before you put
your selves into a Rage against it, I beg of
you to read St. <HI>Theophilus</HI> of <HI>Antioch, Ori∣gen,</HI>
St. <HI>Hilary,</HI> St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI>
St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> St. <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI>
St. <HI>Theophylact,</HI> and other occasio∣nal
ancient Pieces on one Part or other of
the <HI>Evangelists</HI>; and you'll find, how they
countenance such a Discourse as this on
Miracles, and will abundantly assist me in
the Prosecution of it.</P>
<P>I expect, <HI>Sirs,</HI> that some of you will be
ready to rave against me for this Dis∣course;
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
but this is my Comfort, that if
your Passion should arise to another Pro∣secution
of me, you can't possibly sepe∣rate
any of mine from the Opinions of the
Fathers to ground a Prosecution on: And
what Dishonor in the End will redown to
Protestant and pretendedly learned <HI>Divines</HI>
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to persecute a∣gain
the Fathers for primitive Doctrine,
I desire you to think on.</P>
<P>But as I suppose you'll have more Wit,
<HI>Sirs,</HI> than to prosecute me again for this
Discourse; so I hope you'll have more In∣genuity
than odiously (after your wonted
manner) to represent me to the Populace,
for Profaneness, Blasphemy and Infedelity.
If you dislike the whole or any Part of
this Discourse, appear like Men and Scho∣lars,
from the <HI>Press</HI> against it. Use me as
roughly in Print as you think fit, I'll not
take it ill.</P>
<Q>Veniam petimus, dabimus{que} vicissim.</Q>
<P>I desire nothing more than to be furiously
attack'd from the <HI>Press,</HI> which, if I am not
much mistaken, would give me a long'd for
opportunity to expose your Ignorance to
more Advantage.</P>
<P>Be not longer mistaken, <HI>Good Sirs.</HI> The
History of <HI>Jesus's</HI> Life, as recorded in the
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
<HI>Evangelists</HI> is an emblematical Representa∣tion
of his Spiritual Life in the Soul of
Man; and his Miracles are Figures of his
mysterious Operations. The four Gospels
are in no Part a litteral Story, but a System
of mystical Phylosophy or Theology.</P>
<P>If you are resolv'd not to come into this
Opinion, I beg of you again, before you
break forth into a Passion, to try to viudi∣cate
the litteral Story of the three Mira∣cles
spoken to in this Discourse, <HI>viz.</HI> those
of Jesus's <HI>driving the Buyers and Sellers out
of the Temple; of his exorcising the Devil
out of the Madman; and of his Transfigu∣ration
on the Mount</HI>; which if you are able
to defend against the Fathers and my Ob∣jections,
I'll give up the Cause to you,
and own my self (what I am sarr enough
from being) an impious Insidel and Blas∣phemer,
and deserving of the worst Punish∣ment.
In the mean time I make bold
again to assert, that the litteral Story of
Christ' Life and Miracles is an absurd and
incredible Romance, full of Contradictions
and Inconsistencys; and that modern Para∣phrases
are not only a consequential Re∣flection
on the Intellects of the <HI>Evangelists</HI>
and their Divine Gifts of the Spirit, as if
they could not write an intelligible and
coherent Piece of Biography without your
Help at this Distance of Time; but have
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
are like an <HI>high-mettal'd blind Horse,</HI> that,
were they not ridden by the Civil Autho∣rity
with a strait Rein, would be oppres∣sing
and trampling upon all, that stood in
the Way of their Interests, to the Distur∣bance
of <HI>Civil Society.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Profaneness</HI> to do's the <HI>Bishop</HI> charge
me with. But why so? Because I ridicule
the Nonsense and Absurditys of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Miracles according to the Letter, which
he venerates. Very fine indeed! The
<HI>Bishop</HI> would worship the <HI>Head</HI> of an <HI>Ass,</HI>
and a wiser Man than himself, without
the Charge of Profaneness, must not laugh
at his foolish Superstition.</P>
<P>And <HI>Blasphemy</HI> lastly does the <HI>Bishop</HI>
accuse me of: And this is a sad <HI>Bugbear</HI>
Word, that has frighted Abundance of
People into dreadful Apprehensions of my
Guilt, even to the Abhorrence of me. But
the <HI>Bishop</HI> should first have defined, what
is meant by <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> and have proved
one guilty of it, before he made his Ex∣clamations:
Or the <HI>Turks</HI> may say that
a Jest upon their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> in which there
are no Contradictions, is as much a <HI>Blas∣phemy,</HI>
as any Ludicrousness upon the
<HI>Gospels,</HI> which are full of Inconsistencies.
That there is such a Sin or Error, call'd
<HI>Blasphemy,</HI> according to the Scriptures, is
certain: But our <HI>Divines</HI> are undetermined
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
about the Nature of it. I intend to take
my Opportunity to treat on the Sin of
Blasphemy, and to prove, <HI>Ministers</HI> of
the <HI>Letter</HI> are the only Persons, that can
be guilty of it. <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Letter,</HI>
upon the Authority of the Fathers are
the Worshippers of the <HI>Apocalyptical Beast</HI>;
and anti-allegorical Expositions are that
Blasphemy, St. <HI>John</HI> writes of, which the
<HI>Beast</HI> and his Worshippers, will open their
Mouths in, against the most High. This
shall be proved as clear as the Light.
But when I do it, I would not have any
think, it is with an Intention, to bring
the Bishops of <HI>London, Litchfield,</HI> and St.
<HI>Davids</HI> or any other <HI>Divines,</HI> under Prose∣cution
for that heinous Sin: No, my God
is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipre∣sent;
and knows how and when to reckon
with such Blasphemers, without calling
upon the civil Magistrate to do it for
him. Should I importune the Civil Au∣thority
to execute Vengeance upon them▪
I should make a foolish <HI>Calf</HI> or a Sense¦less <HI>Idol</HI> of my God, that was unable
or knew not how, nor when to vindi∣cate
his own Cause. Surely the <HI>Bisho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> upon his Prosecution of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
for Blasphemy, must think his God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>asleep</HI> or <HI>gone a Journey</HI> from Home; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
he would not be for taking God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
Work out of his Hands, and committing
it to the Care of the Civil Magistrate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bishop</HI> moreover should consider,
that the Words <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>blasphemous</HI>
are of no use and significaiton among
Philosophers, who in Disputation never
cast them at each other, however they
may differ in Opinion. Philosophers are
all supposed to be such profound Vene∣rators
of the Deity, as they would not
be guilty of <HI>Profaneness</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy</HI>
for the whole World. If any of our
School of <HI>Free-Thinkers</HI> should say of his
Opponent that he's <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>blasphe∣mous,</HI>
he would be reprimanded for want
of Wit, Temper and good Manners; and
be told that he's like a <HI>Billing sgate Scold,</HI>
who had Recourse to impertinent bad Lan∣guage,
when her Reason fails her for bet∣ter
Rhetorick.</P>
<P>But it may be, for ought I know, the
<HI>Bishop</HI> has some Design in his Accusa∣tions
against me for <HI>Profaneness</HI> and <HI>Blas∣phemy</HI>;
but I hope it is a better than to
prejudice the Civil Magistrate, or to in∣cense
the Populace.</P>
<P>According to the Fathers I am so far
from being a Blasphemer, that they say,
<HI>Christ</HI> upon the litteral interpretation of his
Miracles is metamorphosed into the false-Christ,
call'd <HI>Anti-Christ.</HI> Whether there
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
is any Truth in this their Opinion I can't
be positive, till the Experiment is fully
made. But if our <HI>Clergy</HI> will keep their
Temper, and grant me a clear Stage of
Battle, I'll try it out; and see whether I
I can't, by the Club of Reason and primi∣tive
Authority give their <HI>Anti-Christ</HI> a fa∣tal
Blow: Who knows but I may give
Peace to the Church, and reconcile all
Partys by it?</P>
<P>However this may be; I am sure, no
Man can wish for a greater Advantage
over his Enemy, than I have over the
<HI>Bishop</HI> in this Controversy: But he shall
find me a generous Adversary, who will
make no worse use of my Advantage
over him than now and then to put him
in Mind of his <HI>Pastoral Letter,</HI> and of the
Prosecution; unless I should be tempted,
ere long, to publish my <HI>Moderatorial</HI>
Letter, like his <HI>Pastoral</HI> one, to the Peo∣ple
of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> with <HI>Ten</HI>
wholesome Rules in it, not only to cau∣tion
them against false Prophets and false
Teachers, without forgetting the <HI>Bishop</HI> of
the <HI>Diocese,</HI> but to direct them to the
Ecclesiastical Fountain of the growing
Sins, Errors and Infidelity of the Age,
which the <HI>Clergy</HI> know I am of Ability
to lay open.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="76"/>
When I began the Publication of these
<HI>Discourses,</HI> I own, I laid a <HI>Trap</HI> for some
considerable <HI>Clergyman</HI>; but little ima∣gined,
the great <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> would
be caught in it. But now I have taken
hold of him, I'll not release him out of the
Controversy, till he has sorely repented of
his Ignorance or Malice in calling me a
<HI>Writer, in Favour of Infidelity.</HI></P>
<P>So much at present for the Bishop of
<HI>London.</HI> I have been the quicker of late
in the printing of <HI>this</HI>; because I am given
to understand, the <HI>Bishop</HI> of St. <HI>Davids</HI>
stays for it, intending to make but one
Work of it, and answer all <HI>six Discourses</HI> together. I hope my <HI>Rabbi</HI>'s Letter here
will be thought by him, a good Payment
for his Patience, And now I shall be in
Expectation of his Mountainous Produc∣tion,
and where I shall hide myself from
the terrible Strokes of his Pen, I have not
as yet consider'd.</P>
<P>I am not a little pleas'd to see a <HI>Couple</HI>
of Dissenting Preachers, <HI>viz.</HI> Dr. <HI>Harris</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Atkinson,</HI> listed into the Contro∣versy
against me. If they had kept their
Necks out of the Collar, they might have
dissembled and pretended, that, upon the
Conclusion of the Battle, when it would
have appear'd, I am a real Contender for
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
Primitive Christianity, they had a better
Understanding of the Fathers, and a
clearer View of my Design, than to sus∣pect
me of Blasphemy and Infidelity:
But now they are engaged with equal
Spite, Ignorance and Defamations against
me, they must take their share of the Fate
and Shame, with the <HI>Clergy,</HI> upon the
Conclusion of the Controversy</P>
<P>There's no Body can think it worth my
while to bestow a Sixpenny <HI>Pamphlet</HI> upon
either of these <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> but for all that,
they shall not be altogether slighted and
neglected by me. I have made a Collec∣tion
of their Rhetorical Flowers, which
occasionally shall be presented to the Pub∣lick,
to the Admiration of their Wit,
Reason, Learning and Eloquence. And
at present only take Notice, that they
are <HI>both</HI> for the Persecution of me; but
not so much for my Opinions, as the In∣decency,
Irreverence, and Immorality of
my Stile; forfooth ! which is such a
Distinction, as may be easily Stretch'd to
the Justification of the Persecution of all
Authors, whom the Priesthood in Power
shall not like. Mr. <HI>Atkinson's</HI> Argument
for the Presecution of me, is much the
same with that, which <HI>John Calvin</HI> used
for the Persecution of that great Philoso∣pher
<HI>Servetus</HI>; the Injustice and Cruelty of
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
whose death and sufferings is a greater
Reproach to the Name of <HI>Calvin,</HI> than the
Martyrdom of any <HI>Protestant</HI> can be to
the Memory of any Popish Prelate.</P>
<P>To conclude, what I have written, in
these <HI>Six Discourses,</HI> is with a View to
the Glory of God, the Advancement of
Truth, the Happiness of Mankind, the
Demolition of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Edification
of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the Demonstration of the
Messiahship of our Spiritual <HI>Jesus,</HI> to
whom be Glory for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
