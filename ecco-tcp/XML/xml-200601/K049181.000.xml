Beside some water's rushy brink</L>
<L>With me the Muse shall sit, and think</L>

<L>How vain the ardour of the Crowd,</L>

Alike the Busy and the Gay</L>
<L>But flutter thro' life's little day,</L>
<L>In fortune's varying colours drest:</L>
<L>Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,</L>
<L>Or chill'd by age, their airy dance</L>
<L>They leave, in dust to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methinks I hear in accents low</L>
<L>The sportive kind reply:</L>
<L>Poor moralist! and what art thou?</L>
<L>A solitary fly!</L>
<L>Thy Joys no glittering female meets,</L>
<L>No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,</L>

No painted plumage to display:</L>

<L>Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone—</L>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF A
FAVOURITE CAT,
Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'T WAS on a lofty vase's side,</L>
<L>Where China's gayest art had dy'd</L>
<L>The azure flowers, that blow;</L>
<L>Demurest of the tabby kind,</L>
<L>The pensive Selima reclin'd,</L>
<L>Gazed on the lake below.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="12"/>
Her conscious tail her joy declar'd;</L>
<L>The fair round face, the snowy beard,</L>
<L>The velvet of her paws,</L>
<L>Her coat, that with the tortoise vies,</L>
<L>Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,</L>
<L>She saw; and purr'd applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still had she gaz'd; but 'midst the tide</L>
<L>Two angel forms were seen to glide,</L>
<L>The Genii of the stream:</L>
<L>Their scaly armour's Tyrian hue</L>
<L>Thro' richest purple to the view</L>
<L>Betray'd a golden gleam.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="13"/>
The hapless Nymph with wonder saw:</L>
<L>A whisker first and then a claw,</L>
<L>With many an ardent wish,</L>
<L>She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize.</L>
<L>What female heart can gold despise?</L>
<L>What Cat's averse to fish?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Presumptuous Maid! with looks intent</L>
<L>Again she stretch'd, again she bent,</L>
<L>Nor knew the gulf between.</L>
<L>(Malignant Fate sat by, and smil'd)</L>
<L>The slipp'ry verge her feet beguil'd,</L>
<L>She tumbled headlong in.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="14"/>
Eight times emerging from the flood</L>
<L>She mew'd to ev'ry wat'ry God,</L>
<L>Some speedy aid to send.</L>
<L>No Dolphin came, no Nereid stirr'd:</L>
<L>Nor cruel <HI>Tom,</HI> nor <HI>Susan</HI> heard.</L>
<L>A Fav'rite has no friend!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From hence, ye Beauties, undeceiv'd,</L>
<L>Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd,</L>
<L>And be with caution bold.</L>
<L>Not all that tempts your wand'ring eyes</L>
<L>And heedless hearts, is lawful prize;</L>
<L>Nor all, that glisters, gold.</L>

And ye, that from the stately brow</L>

<L>Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among</L>
<L>Wanders the hoary Thames along</L>
<L>His silver-winding way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah happy hills, ah pleasing shade,</L>
<L>Ah fields belov'd in vain,</L>
<L>Where once my careless childhood stray'd,</L>
<L>A stranger yet to pain!</L>
<L>I feel the gales, that from ye blow,</L>
<L>A momentary bliss bestow,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, Father THAMES, for thou hast seen</L>
<L>Full many a sprightly race</L>
<L>Disporting on thy margent green</L>
<L>The paths of pleasure trace,</L>
<L>Who foremost now delight to cleave</L>
<L>With pliant arm thy glassy wave?</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
The captive linnet which enthrall?</L>
<L>What idle progeny succeed</L>
<L>To chase the rolling circle's speed,</L>
<L>Or urge the flying ball?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While some on earnest business bent</L>
<L>Their murm'ring labours ply</L>
<L>'Gainst graver hours, that bring constraint</L>
<L>To sweeten liberty:</L>
<L>Some bold adventurers disdain</L>
<L>The limits of their little reign,</L>
<L>And unknown regions dare descry:</L>
<L>Still as they run they look behind,</L>
<L>They hear a voice in every wind,</L>
<L>And snatch a fearful joy.</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed,</L>
<L>Less pleasing when possest;</L>
<L>The tear forgot as soon as shed,</L>
<L>The sunshine of the breast:</L>
<L>Theirs buxom health of rosy hue,</L>
<L>Wild wit, invention ever-new,</L>
<L>And lively chear of vigour born;</L>
<L>The thoughtless day, the easy night,</L>
<L>The spirits pure, the slumbers light,</L>
<L>That fly th' approach of morn.</L>

<L>Alas, regardless of their doom,</L>
<L>The little victims play!</L>
<L>No sense have they of ills to come,</L>
<L>Nor care beyond to-day:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Yet see how all around 'em wait</L>
<L>The Ministers of human fate,</L>
<L>And black Misfortune's baleful train!</L>
<L>Ah, shew them where in ambush stand</L>
<L>To seize their prey the murth'rous band!</L>
<L>Ah, tell them, they are men!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These shall the fury Passions tear,</L>
<L>The vulturs of the mind,</L>
<L>Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear,</L>
<L>And Shame that sculks behind;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Or pineing Love shall waste their youth,</L>
<L>Or Jealousy with rankling tooth,</L>
<L>That inly gnaws the secret heart,</L>
<L>And Envy wan, and faded Care,</L>
<L>Grim-visag'd comfortless Despair,</L>
<L>And Sorrow's piercing dart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ambition this shall tempt to rise,</L>
<L>Then whirl the wretch from high,</L>
<L>To bitter Scorn a sacrifice,</L>
<L>And grinning Infamy,</L>
<L>The stings of Falshood those shall try,</L>
<L>And hard Unkindness' alter'd eye,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow;</L>
<L>And keen Remorse with blood defil'd,</L>
<L>And moody Madness<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Madness laughing in his ireful mood.</L></Q><BIBL>Dryden's Fable of Palamon and Arcitc.</BIBL></NOTE> laughing wild</L>

<L>Lo, in the vale of years beneath</L>
<L>A griesly troop are seen,</L>
<L>The painful family of Death,</L>
<L>More hideous than their Queen:</L>
<L>This racks the joints, this fires the veins,</L>
<L>That every labouring finew strains,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Those in the deeper vitals rage:</L>
<L>Lo, Poverty, to fill the band,</L>
<L>That numbs the soul with icy hand,</L>
<L>And slow-consuming Age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To each his suff'rings: all are men,</L>
<L>Condemn'd alike to groan;</L>
<L>The tender for another's pain,</L>
<L>Th' unfeeling for his own.</L>
<L>Yet ah! why should they know their fate?</L>
<L>Since sorrow never comes too late,</L>
<L>And happiness too swiftly flies.</L>
<L>Thought would destroy their paradise.</L>

<P>IN the Eleventh Century <HI>Sigurd,</HI> Earl of the

considerable body of troops into Ireland, to the assist∣ance
of <HI>Sictryg with the silken beard,</HI> who was then
making war on his father-in-law <HI>Brian,</HI> King of
Dublin: the Earl and all his forces were cut to
pieces, and <HI>Sictryg</HI> was in danger of a total defeat;
but the enemy had a greater loss by the death of
<HI>Brian,</HI> their King, who fell in the action. On
Christmas-day, (the day of the battle,) a Native of
<HI>Gaithness</HI> in Scotland saw at a distance a number of
persons on horseback riding full speed towards a hill,
<PB REF="71"/>
and seeming to enter into it. Curiosity led him to
follow them, till looking through an opening in the
rocks he saw twelve gigantic figures resembling wo∣men:
they were all employed about a loom; and as
they wove, they sung the following dreadful Song;
which when they had finished, they tore the web into
twelve pieces, and (each taking her portion) gal∣loped
