<HEAD>EPISTLE I. Of the Nature and State of Man with respect to the Universe.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of</HI> Man <HI>in the</HI> Abstract. <HI>We can judge only with regard to our</HI> own System, <HI>being ignorant of the</HI> Relations <HI>of Systems and Things,</HI> VERSE 17, <HI>&amp;c. Man is not therefore to be deem'd</HI> Im∣perfect, <HI>but a Being suited to his Place and Rank in the Crea∣tion, agreeable to the</HI> General Order <HI>of Things, and conformable to</HI> Ends <HI>and</HI> Relations <HI>to Him unknown,</HI> 35, <HI>&amp;c. It is partly upon this</HI> Ignorance <HI>of future Events, and partly upon the</HI> Hope <HI>of a Future State, that all his Happiness in the Present depends,</HI> 73, <HI>&amp;c. His</HI> Pride, <HI>in aiming at more</HI> Knowledge, <HI>and pretend∣ing to more</HI> Perfection, <HI>the Cause of his Error and Misery,</HI> 120. <HI>The</HI> Impiety <HI>of putting himself in the Place of</HI> God, <HI>and judging of the Fitness or Unfitness, Perfection or Imperfection, Justice or Injustice, of His Dispensations,</HI> 109. <HI>The</HI> Absurdity <HI>of conceiting himself the</HI> Final Cause <HI>of the Creation, or expect∣ing that Perfection in the</HI> Moral <HI>World which is not in the</HI> Na∣tural, 127 <HI>to</HI> 164. <HI>The</HI> Unreasonableness <HI>of his Complaints against Providence, while on the one Hand he demands the Per∣fections of the</HI> Angels, <HI>on the other the bodily Qualifications of the</HI> Brutes, 165. <HI>That the Gift of</HI> Reason alone <HI>countervails all the latter, and that to possess any of the</HI> Sensitive Faculties <HI>in a higher Degree, would render him miserable,</HI> 181, 221. <HI>That throughout the whole visible World, an Universal</HI> Order <HI>and</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Gradation <HI>in these is observ'd, which causes a</HI> Subordination <HI>of Creature to Creature, and of all Creatures to Man. The Grada∣tions of</HI> Sense, Instinct, Thought, Reflection, Reason, 199, <HI>to</HI> 124. <HI>How much</HI> farther <HI>this Order and Subordination of living Creatures may extend, above and below us?</HI> 225. <HI>Were any</HI> Part <HI>of this broken, not that Part only, but the</HI> Whole <HI>connected</HI> Cre∣ation <HI>must be destroyed. The Extravagance, Madness, and Pride of such a Desire,</HI> 239, <HI>&amp;c. Consequently, the absolute Submission due to Providence, both as to our</HI> Present <HI>and</HI> Future <HI>State,</HI> 269. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<LG>
<L>AWAKE! my LAELIUS leave all meaner things</L>
<L>To low Ambition, and the Pride of Kings.</L>
<L>Let us (since Life can little more supply</L>
<L>Than just to look about us, and to die)</L>
<L N="5">Expatiate free o'er all this <HI>Scene of Man</HI>;</L>
<L>A mighty Maze! but not without a Plan;</L>
<L>A Wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot,</L>
<L>Or Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.</L>
<L>Together let us beat this ample Field,</L>
<L N="10">Try what the open, what the covert yield,</L>
<L>The latent Tracts, the giddy Heights explore</L>
<L>Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;</L>
<L>Eye Nature's Walk, shoot Folly as it flies,</L>
<L>And catch the Manners living as they rise;</L>
<L N="15">Laugh where we <HI>must,</HI> be candid where we <HI>can,</HI></L>
<L>But vindicate the Ways of <HI>God</HI> to Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say first, of <HI>God</HI> above, or <HI>Man</HI> below,</L>
<L>What can we <HI>reason,</HI> but from what we <HI>know</HI>?</L>
<L>Of Man, what see we but his Station here,</L>
<L N="20">From which to reason, or to which refer?</L>
<L>Thro' Worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known,</L>
<L>'Tis ours to trace him, only in our own;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
He who thro' vast Immensity can pierce,</L>
<L>See Worlds on Worlds compose one Universe,</L>
<L N="25">Observe how System into System runs,</L>
<L>What other Planets, and what other Suns:</L>
<L>What vary'd Being peoples ev'ry Star:</L>
<L>May tell, why Heav'n made all things as they are.</L>
<L>But of this Frame the Bearings, and the Ties,</L>
<L N="30">The strong Connections, nice Dependencies,</L>
<L>Gradations just, has thy pervading Soul</L>
<L>Look'd thro'? or can a Part contain the Whole?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is the great Chain that draws all to agree,</L>
<L>And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Presumptuous Man! the Reason would'st thou find,</L>
<L N="35">Why form'd so weak, so little, and so blind?</L>
<L>First, if thou can'st, the harder reason guess,</L>
<L>Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less;</L>
<L>Ask of thy Mother Earth, why Oaks are made</L>
<L N="40">Taller or stronger than the Weeds they shade?</L>
<L>Or ask of yonder argent fields above,</L>
<L>Why JOVE's Satellites are less than JOVE?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of Systems possible, if 'tis confest</L>
<L>That Wisdom infinite must form the <HI>Best,</HI></L>
<L N="45">Where all must <HI>full</HI> or not <HI>coherent</HI> be,</L>
<L>And all that rises, rise in due degree;</L>
<L>Then, in the Scale of Life and Sense 'tis plain</L>
<L>There must be, <HI>some where,</HI> such a Rank as <HI>Man</HI>;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
And all the Question (wrangle e'er so long)</L>
<L N="50">Is only this, if God has <HI>plac'd him wrong</HI>?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Respecting <HI>Man</HI> whatever wrong we call,</L>
<L>May, must be right, as relative to <HI>All.</HI></L>
<L>In human works, tho' labour'd on with pain,</L>
<L>A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;</L>
<L N="55">In God's, one single can <HI>its End</HI> produce,</L>
<L>Yet serves to second too some <HI>other Use.</HI></L>
<L>So Man, who here seems principal alone,</L>
<L>Perhaps acts second to some Sphere unknown,</L>
<L>Touches some Wheel, or verges to some Gole;</L>
<L N="60">'Tis but a Part we see, and not a Whole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the proud Steed shall know, why Man restrains</L>
<L>His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains;</L>
<L>When the dull Ox, why now he breaks the clod,</L>
<L>Now wears a Garland, an Aegyptian God;</L>
<L N="65">Then shall Man's Pride and Dulness comprehend</L>
<L>His Action's, Passion's, Being's, Use and End;</L>
<L>Why doing, suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why</L>
<L>This Hour a Slave, the next a Deity!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then say not Man's imperfect, Heav'n in Fault,</L>
<L N="70">Say rather, Man's as perfect as he ought;</L>
<L>His being measur'd to his State, and Place,</L>
<L>His time a Moment, and a Point his Space.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of Fate,</L>
<L>All but the page prescrib'd, their <HI>present state</HI>;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
From Brutes what Men, from Men what Spirits know;</L>
<L N="75">Or who could suffer Being here below?</L>
<L>The Lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day</L>
<L>Had he thy <HI>Reason</HI> woul'd he skip and play?</L>
<L>Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry Food,</L>
<L N="80">And licks the Hand just rais'd to shed his blood.</L>
<L>Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n,</L>
<L>That each may fill the Circle mark'd by Heav'n,</L>
<L>Who sees with equal eye, as God of All,</L>
<L>A Hero perish, or a Sparrow fall,</L>
<L N="85">Atoms, or Systems, into ruin hurl'd,</L>
<L>And now a Bubble burst, and now a World!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar;</L>
<L>Wait the great Teacher, Death, and God adore!</L>
<L>What bliss above, he gives not thee to know,</L>
<L N="90">But gives that <HI>Hope</HI> to be thy blessing now.</L>
<L><HI>Hope</HI> springs eternal in the human breast;</L>
<L>Man never <HI>is,</HI> but always <HI>to be</HI> blest;</L>
<L>The soul uneasy, and confin'd at home,</L>
<L>Rests, and expatiates in a life to come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="95">Lo! the poor INDIAN, whose untutor'd Mind</L>
<L>Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the Wind;</L>
<L>His soul, proud Science never taught to stray</L>
<L>Far as the Solar walk, or Milky way;</L>
<L>Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n</L>
<L N="100">Behind the cloud-topt hill an humbler Heav'n,</L>
<L>Some safer world in depth of Woods embrac'd,</L>
<L>Some happier island in the watry waste;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Where Slaves once more their native land behold,</L>
<L>No Fiends torment, no Christians thirst for Gold.</L>
<L N="105">To <HI>be</HI> content's his natural desire,</L>
<L>He asks no Angel's Wing or Seraph's Fire,</L>
<L>But thinks, admitted to that equal sky</L>
<L>His faithful Dog shall bear him company.</L>
<L>Go, wiser Thou! and in thy scale of sense</L>
<L N="110">Weigh thy <HI>Opinion</HI> against <HI>Providence</HI>:</L>
<L>Call Imperfection what thou fancy'st such,</L>
<L>Say, here HE gives too little, there too much;</L>
<L>Destroy all Creatures for thy sport or gust,</L>
<L>Yet cry, if Man's unhappy, God's unjust;</L>
<L N="115">If Man, alone, engross not Heav'ns high Care,</L>
<L>Alone, made perfect here, immortal there:</L>
<L>Snatch from his hand the Balance and the Rod;</L>
<L>Rejudge his Justice, Be the GOD of GOD!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In reas'ning <HI>Pride</HI> (my Friend) our error lies;</L>
<L N="120">All quit their sphere, and rush into the Skies.</L>
<L>Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,</L>
<L>Men would be Angels, Angels would be Gods.</L>
<L>Aspiring to be Gods, if Angels fell,</L>
<L>Aspiring to be Angels, Men rebel:</L>
<L N="125">And who but wishes to invert the Laws</L>
<L>Of ORDER, sins against th' Eternal Cause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine?</L>
<L>Earth for whose use? <HI>Pride</HI> answers, "'Tis for mine:</L>
<L>"For me kind Nature wakes her genial Power,</L>
<L N="130">"Suckles each herb, and swells out ev'ry flow'r;</L>

"Annual for me, the Grape, the Rose renew</L>
<L>"The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew!</L>
<L>"For me, the Mine a thousand treasures brings,</L>
<L>"For me, health gushes from a thousand Springs;</L>
<L N="135">"Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise;</L>
<L>"My Footstool Earth, my Canopy the Skies!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But errs not Nature from this gracious end,</L>
<L>From burning suns when livid deaths descend,</L>
<L>When Earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep</L>
<L N="140">Towns to one grave, a Nation to the deep?</L>
<L>"No ('tis reply'd) the first Almighty Cause</L>
<L>"Acts not by partial, but by <HI>gen'ral Laws</HI>:</L>
<L>"Th' exceptions few; some change since all began;</L>
<L>"And what created, perfect?"—Why then <HI>Man</HI>?</L>
<L N="145">If the <HI>great End</HI> be human Happiness,</L>
<L>And Nature deviates; how can Man do less?</L>
<L>As much that End a constant course requires</L>
<L>Of Show'rs and sunshine, as of man's desires,</L>
<L>As much eternal springs and cloudless skies,</L>
<L N="150">As men for ever temp'rate, calm, and wise.</L>
<L>If Plagues or Earthquakes break not Heav'n's design,</L>
<L>Why then a <HI>Borgia</HI> or a <HI>Cataline</HI>?</L>
<L>From Pride, from Pride, our very reas'ning springs;</L>
<L>Account for moral, as for nat'ral things:</L>
<L N="155">Why charge we Heav'n in those, in these acquit?</L>
<L>In both, to reason right, is to submit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Better for US, perhaps, it might appear,</L>
<L>Were there all Harmony, all Virtue here;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
That never Air or Ocean felt the wind;</L>
<L N="160">That never Passion discompos'd the mind;</L>
<L>But ALL subsists by Elemental strife;</L>
<L>And Passions are the Elements of Life.</L>
<L>The gen'ral ORDER, since the whole began,</L>
<L>Is kept in <HI>Nature,</HI> and is kept in <HI>Man.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What would this Man? now upward will he soar,</L>
<L N="(165">And little less than Angel, would be more;</L>
<L>Now looking downward, just as griev'd appears</L>
<L>To want the strength of Bulls, the Fur of Bears.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature to these, without profusion kind,</L>
<L>The proper organs, proper pow'rs assign'd,</L>
<L>Each seeming want compensated of course,</L>
<L>Here, with degrees of Swiftness; there, of Force;</L>
<L N="175">All in exact proportion to the State,</L>
<L>Nothing to add, and nothing to abate.</L>
<L>Each Beast, each Insect, happy in its own;</L>
<L>Is Heav'n unkind to Man, and Man alone?</L>
<L>Shall he alone, whom rational we call,</L>
<L N="180">Be pleas'd with nothing, if not bless'd with all?</L>

<L>The bliss of Man (could Pride that blessing find)</L>
<L>Is, not to think, or act <HI>beyond</HI> Mankind;</L>
<L>No Pow'rs of Body, or of Soul to share,</L>
<L>But what his Nature, and his State can bear.</L>
<L N="185">Why has not Man a microscopic sight?</L>
<L>For this plain reason, Man is not a Mite:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Say, what th' Advantage of so fine an eye?</L>
<L>T' inspect a Mote, not comprehend the Sky?</L>
<L>Or Touch, so tremblingly alive all o'er,</L>
<L N="190">To smart, and agonize et ev'ry pore?</L>
<L>Or quick Effluvia darting thro' the brain,</L>
<L>To sink opprest with Aromatic pain?</L>
