<HI>Britannia</HI>'s Woe, when Royal <HI>ANNE</HI> expir'd,</L>
<L>What mortal Painter can suffice? Descend,</L>
<L><HI>Urania,</HI> Child of Memory and <HI>Jove!</HI></L>
<L>O Goddess of Celestial Imag'ry,</L>
<L>Queen of immortal Colours, Deathless Strokes,</L>
<L>And Graces that can charm the rudest Minds.</L>
<L>Speaking, thou paint'st with so Divine a Skill,</L>
<L>That Gods and Men are ravish'd with the Draught.</L>
<L>And when thou dictate'st to thy Godlike Sons;</L>
<L>Thy Influence makes the Pen's immortal Draught</L>
<L>Victorious o'er the Pencil's dying Toil.</L>
<L>Goddess, descend then, and inspire my Song,</L>
<L>That it with native Majesty may rise</L>
<L>High, as the sacred Spring from which it flows,</L>
<L>That I may, painting, sing <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Woe,</L>
<L>In such a moving, such a melting Strain,</L>

Lamenting all the Virtues of her QUEEN,</L>
<L>All the great Actions of her wond'rous Reign,</L>
<L>In which the Terrour of the <HI>British</HI> Arms</L>
<L>Was carry'd to <HI>Germania</HI>'s horrid <HI>Alps;</HI></L>
<L>Their Fame beyond the Ocean's farthest Waves.</L>
<L>Then let her wring her late victorious Arms,</L>
<L>And rend the Laurels from her sacred Hair;</L>
<L>Muse, paint her Woe, accompany'd with Care,</L>
<L>And black Mistrust, and with tormenting Fear,</L>

<L>Now, Muse, begin a new and nobler Strain,</L>

<L>Their rightful King, the Royal <HI>GEORGE,</HI> proclaim.</L>
<L>Heark how the Air with Shouts of Joy resounds,</L>

<L>An Entertainment worthier Majesty,</L>
<L>And far more pleasing to the Monarch's Soul,</L>
<L>Than all the pompous Pageantry of State,</L>
<L>And vain Magnificence of dying Show.</L>
<L>The low Obeisance, and the prostrate Bows,</L>
<L>That, on all Hands, obsequiously are paid;</L>
<L>For these may flow from Traytors and from Focs;</L>
<L>But these the Loyal Subjects humble Love,</L>
<L>And cordial Joy declare. And, lo! he comes,</L>

<HI>Britannia</HI>'s other Hope, the other Dread of <HI>Gaul.</HI></L>

<L>While the shrill Trumpets, with their Silver Sounds,</L>
<L>Inspire a martial and heroick Joy;</L>
<L>And our deep Cannons formidable Roar,</L>
<L>The Ruler of the World's Vicegerent Thunder,</L>
<L>Bears the transporting Tidings to the Skies,</L>
<L>Where Angels louder Hallelujah's sing,</L>

<L>All the long Labours of his anxious Days,</L>
<L>And all the restless Slumbers of his Nights,</L>
<L>Were destin'd to secure this Sacred Day,</L>
<L>His daily Image, and his nightly Dream:</L>
<L>For this Great <HI>William</HI> liv'd, and reign'd, and dy'd.</L>
<L>But whither, Muse, do'st thou transported rove?</L>
<L>Immortal Child of <HI>Memory</HI> and <HI>Jove,</HI></L>
<L>Return to his Vicegerent here below,</L>
<L>And to the King thy Eyes and Thoughts confine,</L>
<L>On whom the Eyes of Gods and Men are fix'd:</L>

<L>That thou may'st paint him to the gazing World,</L>
<L>Paint him with native Majesty adorn'd,</L>
<L>But heightned with a thousand great Exploits,</L>
<L>Perform'd upon <HI>Pannonia</HI>'s wondring Plains,</L>
<L>Where he for twenty Years victorious fought</L>
<L>Against the Foe of all the Christian World:</L>

E'en then the Great <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI></L>
<L>And Champion of th' Almighty, under him</L>
<L>Spotless Religion will be still secure,</L>
<L>In Spite of all the Attacks of <HI>Rome</HI> and Hell.</L>
<L>Muse, Paint no Terrour on his Regal Brow;</L>
<L>But Love and Majesty together blend;</L>
<L>And let him look a King resolv'd to rule</L>
<L>Over his Subject's Hearts: Ev'n God himself,</L>

<L>If they o'er senseless Matter only reign,</L>
<L>Are but Dramatick Kings; to rule o'er Souls,</L>
<L>Over intelligent, immortal Beings,</L>
<L>Is true Dominion, true Imperial Sway.</L>
<L>Muse, paint the King, a Monarch, not by Halves,</L>
<L>But let him reign o'er all his Subjects Hearts.</L>
<L>A King who reigns by Parties, is a King</L>
<L>Only of half his Subjects; and the Lord,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="10"/>
Who has th' Affections of the other half,</L>
<L>Is truly King of that. Let Royal <HI>GEORGE</HI></L>
<L>Possess them all; let him deserve them all</L>
<L>By his just, gentle, and impartial Sway.</L>
<L>And that the King may rule o'er all our Hearts,</L>
<L>Grant him, Thou God of Concord and of Love,</L>
<L>Grant him the Glory to unite those Hearts,</L>
<L>Heal our Divisions, and our Factions calm.</L>
<L>And as thy great creating Pow'r at first,</L>
<L>From warring Elements compos'd the World;</L>
<L>So from our jarring Factions, may the King</L>
<L>Form an harmonious and a glorious State,</L>
<L>That <HI>Britain,</HI> like thy Heav'n, serene within,</L>
<L>May send its Light'ning and its Thunder forth,</L>
<L>T'affright and punish an offending World.</L>
<L>Daughter of <HI>Jove,</HI> Mother of Harmony,</L>
<L>Exhort thy <HI>Britains</HI> to fraternal Love;</L>
<L>'Tis our Divisions that have made us weak,</L>
<L>And to the Nations scandalously vile:</L>
<L>But mutual Love will make us once more strong,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="11"/>
With neighbouring Nations will retrieve our Fame,</L>
<L>And place the Ballance of the Christian Pow'r</L>
<L>In Royal <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s formidable Arm.</L>
<L>Unite then, <HI>Britains,</HI> join both Hearts and Hands;</L>
<L>The barbarous Distinction of vile Names</L>
<L>For ever be remov'd; be <HI>Britons</HI> all,</L>
<L>And look with Indignation and Disdain</L>
<L>On the vile Artifices, that had Pow'r</L>
<L>To divide those whom Heaven and Nature meant,</L>
<L>When it disjoin'd us from the rest of Men,</L>
<L>Should be within our selves for ever one.</L>
<L>The true <HI>Britannick</HI> Tory, and Church Whig,</L>
<L>Names that debase the Majesty of Verse,</L>
<L>Odious Distinctions, mean but the same Thing.</L>
<L>A King by Law from doing Harm restrain'd,</L>
<L>But boundless in his Pow'r of doing Good;</L>
<L>Over all Persons, o'er all Things supream,</L>
<L>Except Superior and Imperial Law.</L>
<L>A People free, and rul'd by Laws they make,</L>
<L>Proud to be Subjects, scorning to be Slaves.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="12"/>
A Church in its own Excellence secure,</L>
<L>Abhorring Violence, abhorring Blood,</L>
<L>And mean Mistrusts, and vain fantastick Fears,</L>
<L>Relying firmly on establish'd Law,</L>
<L>And Promises Divine, which have decreed,</L>
<L>That all the Rage of Earth, and Rage of Hell,</L>
<L>Against its Sacred Pow'r shall ne'er prevail.</L>
<L>The true <HI>Britannick</HI> Tory, and Church Whig,</L>
<L>Mean nought but this, and therefore should be Friends.</L>
<L>And the Dissenter from establish'd Rites,</L>
<L>The sober, scrupulous, conscientious Man,</L>
<L>In Principles political's the same:</L>
<L>With both the other, since they then all three</L>
<L>In Interest and Principle are one,</L>
<L>Let them be three by barbarous Terms no more,</L>
<L>But by Asfection one, and one by Name:</L>
<L>Let them all three be to each other true,</L>
<L>As to the original Compact they are just,</L>
<L>And to their Country's Constitution true.</L>
<L>Let the Dissenter venerate the Church,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="13"/>
And let the Church breathe nought but Heav'nly Love</L>
<L>Towards those who differ from her Sacred Rites,</L>
<L>As surely knowing nothing can create</L>
<L>Danger to her, but Want of Love Divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For those who quarrel with our Country's Laws,</L>
<L>And with our Frame of Government; for those</L>
<L>Who would be too much bound, or too much free;</L>
<L>Those let us now endeavour to reclaim,</L>
<L>Since they were born our Brethren and our Friends.</L>

<LG>
<L>Then let the few, of old Republicks fond,</L>
<L>Know, that our Manners profligately vile,</L>
<L>Can ne'er consist with Democratick Sway;</L>
<L>That they require the Curb of Regal Pow'r,</L>
<L>Tho' justly we tyrannick Rule disdain.</L>

Th' <HI>Aesopian</HI> Frogs, when they desir'd a King,</L>

<L>Whoever governs well, he rules by Law,</L>
<L>By written or eternal Law he rules;</L>
<L>The Law promulgated in human Hearts.</L>
<L>Ev'n the great Ruler of the Universe,</L>
<L>Governs by written or eternal Law;</L>
<L>And none he favours, and chastises none,</L>
<L>But for observing or transgressing Law;</L>
<L>But in hereditary Realms, how few</L>
<L>Are qualify'd to rule by Reason's Law?</L>
<L>Perhaps not four in ten successive Kings,</L>

<L>While <HI>feeble Principle,</HI> to <HI>Nature's Pow'r</HI></L>
<L>Gave Way, and <HI>passive</HI> canting Doctrines fail'd,</L>
<L>As <HI>Roman</HI> and as <HI>Turkish</HI> Records tell;</L>
<L>Where Slaves upon unbounded Lords depend,</L>

To Prince, to People, and to human Kind;</L>
<L>And if he dares to own himself that Foe,</L>
<L>Let him by Prince, by People, and Mankind,</L>
<L>An universal Out-law be proclaim'd,</L>
<L>And like devoted noxious Creatures us'd.</L>

<L>A King the just Executor of Law,</L>
<L>Instead of an unjust and baleful Tyrant,</L>

<L>And brood o'er <HI>Britain</HI> with her downy Wings,</L>
<L>To hatch Felicity and Plenty here.</L>
<L>Then the wise Conduct of the best of Kings</L>
<L>Will shine, and then his Godlike Bounty flow.</L>
<L>The Rich with flowing Plenty will o'erwhelm,</L>
<L>Employ and nourish our yet num'rous Poor;</L>
<L>Our Manufactures will encrease and raise;</L>
<L>Our Commerce will improve, and will extend,</L>
<L>And to our Side incline the pond'rous Scale;</L>
<L>While he, the Ocean's undisputed Lord,</L>
<L>Will call Divine <HI>Astrea</HI> from the Skies,</L>
<L>And causeher Sacred Laws to be observ'd</L>
<L>As strictly on the rude, tempestuous Main,</L>
<L>As they're observ'd on calm <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Shore,</L>
<L>As they're observ'd in her own native Heav'n.</L>

The Numbers of his Subjects he'll augment,</L>
<L>Diminish'd much by three devouring Wars;</L>
<L>Extend our Culture, and improve our Soil;</L>
<L>Will make the Ocean, now the World's great Wast,</L>
<L>It self a fertile and a bounteous Soil,</L>
<L>While his bold <HI>Britons</HI> plough the furrow'd Deep,</L>
<L>And reap a plentiful and living Harvest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At Home the Rich shall jocundly sit down</L>
<L>In the cool Shade of his own branching Vine,</L>
<L>And with its Juice make his poor Brethren glad.</L>
</LG>

<L>But when this glorious long continu'd Peace</L>
<L>Shall advance Commerce to its utmost Height,</L>
<L>Base Poverty, and baser Passions then</L>
<L>For ever shall be banish'd from our Isle.</L>
<L>The Riches of the Earth, the Joys of Heav'n</L>
<L>Shall overflow <HI>Britannia</HI>'s blissful Plains;</L>
<L>The <HI>Eastern</HI> and the <HI>Western</HI> World shall vie</L>

The Merchant shall in sparkling Ruby drink,</L>
<L>And under Golden Canopies shall sleep,</L>
<L>And balmy shall his Slumbers be and long;</L>
<L>The happy Shepherd, with his rural Crook,</L>
<L>Shall the dumb Kingdom under him survey,</L>
<L>And while his Heart distends with Pride and Joy,</L>
<L>Shall see his wanton and his fat'ning Flock,</L>
<L>The Source of all his Country's Wealth and Pow'r▪</L>
<L>Under their pond'rous Fleeces proudly pant,</L>
<L>While numberless, and cov'ring all the Plain,</L>
<L>To the shrill Musick of his jocund Pipe,</L>
<L>Under his ravish'd Eye they still encrease,</L>
<L>And hourly multiply. The whistling Hind</L>
<L>Shall sow the faithful Glebe with sanguine Hope,</L>
<L>Large Interest to extort for what he lends,</L>
<L>And for mild Seasons and a gentle Reign,</L>
<L>Shall praise aloud the Goodness of the King,</L>
<L>And the indulgent Clemency of Heav'n.</L>
<L>Fair Liberty shall, like the <HI>British</HI> Oak,</L>
<L>The long liv'd Oak, grow tall, and branching spread,</L>

And Virtue under Liberty grow strong.</L>
<L>For ever Property shall be secure,</L>
<L>The Publick Credit be for-ever fix'd.</L>
<L>The buisy <HI>Britons,</HI> like industrious Bees,</L>

<L>And Idleness be deem'd the Source of ev'ry Vice.</L>
<L>Pernicious Luxury shall be restrain'd</L>
<L>By wholesom and by sumptuary Laws,</L>
<L>That none his Patrimonial Lands may waste,</L>
<L>And so by dire Necessity be urg'd</L>
<L>To sell his Country, and his King betray.</L>
<L>Unmanly Customs and contagious Vice,</L>
<L>And Fraud beyond the Ocean shall be driv'n;</L>
<L>And Faith, and ev'ry Virtue dwell secure.</L>
<L>Devotion to the Heav'n of Heav'ns shall soar</L>
<L>Upon the flaming Wings of Charity,</L>
<L>And fall again in Blessings on Mankind.</L>
<L>While vile Mistrust, and vain fantastick Fear,</L>
<L>And Envy, Hatred, Malice, Rage, Revenge,</L>
<L>Shall take their Flight to Tyrants Courts Abroad,</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="26"/>
Or take their Flight to Hell, and plague the Damn'd.</L>
<L>No Passion but the Heav'n-born Passion Love,</L>

<L>No Passion here but Love shall reign and Joy,</L>
<L>The lawful and the charming Child of Love.</L>

<L>Goddess, to Thee a Temple we'll erect,</L>
<L>And annual Honours shall be paid: To thee</L>
<L>Peace owes its noblest Ornaments: To thee</L>
<L>Distinguish'd Merit owes its chief Reward,</L>
<L>And Vertues self its Immortality.</L>
<L>Thy tuneful Sons their Raptures shall employ</L>
<L>To celebrate the Blessings, and the Joys,</L>
<L>Of this renown'd and everlasting Peace▪</L>
<L>Thy noblest Sons their Transports shall employ,</L>
<L>Vertue and publick Spirit to advance;</L>
<L>And great and publick Actions to record,</L>

And to reward with everlasting Fame;</L>
<L>T' extol the God-like Patriot to the Skies;</L>
<L>To fix on Traytors an eternal Brand;</L>
<L>And on the venal, vile, accursed Pens,</L>
<L>That with their Lies intoxicate the Crowd,</L>
<L>And make the Beasts run dangerously mad;</L>
<L>While from immortal Merit they detract</L>
<L>Heroick Victories, heroick Deeds,</L>
<L>To which its Happiness, their Country owes</L>
<L>Its Safety, Spirit, Strength, and high Renown.</L>
<L>On these a Brand eternal shall be fix'd,</L>
<L>Eternal Lawrels on our Heroes Heads.</L>
<L>A different Hero to each God-like Bard,</L>
<L>And a peculiar Province shall be given;</L>
<L>But their heroick Transports all shall join,</L>
<L>Redouble all their Raptures and their Flames,</L>
<L>To celebrate the King's auspicious Reign,</L>
<L>And his immortal Name t' extend as far,</L>
<L>As his high Conduct brave, and just, and wise,</L>
<L>Will fair <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Happiness extend.</L>
