marriage. But of these the Respondent can say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
as the Petitioner did acknowledge before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
when the first submission depended, that she had burnt
the said Contract; which is sufficient of itself to show the
disposition of this woman towards her husband's children of
the first marriage.</P>
<P><HI>Jean Brown</HI> died in the 1719, and left three Sons, and one
Daughter; but Bailie <HI>Thomson</HI> finding it not convenient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
keep house by himself, married the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>titioner in the 1720▪
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
with whom he got an annuity of 500 merks, payable out of
some houses in the <HI>Cowgate</HI> which she had from—<HI>Gilchrist</HI>
her former Husband. But so far was she from bringing the
money alledged with her, that her houshold-furniture was sold
to pay her debt, and was not sufficient; neither could it be,
as her first Husband was bankrupt, and his estate soon after
brought to sale before your Lordships, and purchased by
Bailie <HI>Thomson,</HI> for payment of which he sold part of the
lands in <HI>Potterow</HI> which came by his first wife. During the
subsistence of this marriage, Bailie <HI>Thomson</HI> purchaled some
houses, and sold others, and carried on an extensive trade as
a Brewer and Distiller, which was managed by the Respon∣dent
from 1721 to 1729; when the Petitioner wanting to
have the Respondent away from his Father's presence, and
from any management in his business, prevailed on the Father
to take a Brewery for him; for which he promised to give
him at the rate of 15 bolls of malt for all the years he had served
in his brewery; part of which he got, but not near to the
quantity promised; which was all the stock the Respondent
had from his Father, and was far from being sufficient to en∣able
him to carry on his trade.</P>
<P>But ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the 1732, the Bailie finding his own Brewery∣affairs
going into disorder under the management of the Peti∣tioner,
be solicited the Respondent to come back again, and
take upon him the management thereof; which he did, un∣der
the promise of ten pound <HI>per annum,</HI> to keep his pocket:
which he never got. So that the Petitioner is in the wrong
to say, that the Bailie's affairs were brought into disorder by
any advancements or cautionry for him. It is true he be∣came
bound for <HI>Andrew,</HI> his second Son, at his setting up a
cloth and silk shop, to the extent of L. 200; which will fall
to be more particularly noticed afterwards: Basides this, the
Bailie gave a portion with his Daughter when she was mar∣ried;
but the Respondent knows not what that was and he
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
gave L. 20 to his third son <HI>Adam,</HI> who was bred a Surgeon,
when he went abroad. This is all, so far as the Respondent
knows, that the Bailie gave to his children of the first mar∣riage;
which was far from bringing his affairs into any dis∣order;
for, after that he continued in very good circumstances,
possessed of houses which yielded him L. 176 a-year of rent,
besides his extensive trade as Brewer and Distiller.</P>
<P>The Bailie finding himself growing old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1738.</NOTE> of this date,
thought it reasonable, to make a Settlement of his estate a∣mong
his children of the first and second marriage; in which
he disponed to the Respondent his houses in <HI>Bristow</HI> and
<HI>Potterow,</HI> which yeilded L. 22 of rent; besides which, he
had formerly, at making the purchase of the Brewery in the
Grass-market, and some other houses in the Town, secured
the fee of them to the Respondent; which made the share
designed him by his Father to be about L. 80 a-year; but
this was burthened with the Petitioner's liferent to the extent
of L. 58: 5: 6. He likewise disponed to <HI>Adam,</HI> his third
Son of the first marriage, lands in the West-port to the ex∣tent
of L. 13, and to <HI>John</HI> his eldest Son of the second mar∣riage,
he gave lands about the foot of <HI>Forrester</HI>'s wynd, and
about the Meal-market and Exchange, which yielded
L. 57: 15 s. of rent; and to <HI>Joseph,</HI> his second Son of
the second marriage, he gave his lands in the <HI>Cannongate</HI> head,
which yeilded L. 12: 10 s. of rent; to <HI>Anne</HI> and <HI>E∣lizabeth,</HI>
he gave the lands in <HI>Netherbow</HI> and <HI>Leith,</HI> which
yeilded L. 20, 15 s. of rent; to <HI>Jean</HI> and <HI>Helen;</HI> he gave
some houses above Smith's Land: but as these were sold by
himself, he, by an after-deed, burthened his executors with
the payment of L. 100 to each of them; and to <HI>Janet,</HI> he
gave his houses in <HI>Niddrey</HI>'s wynd, which yielded L. 9, 5 s.
and as the Respondent's part was so far affected with the Pe∣titioner's
liserent, the Bailie burthened <HI>John</HI> with the pay∣ment
of 200 merks to him during the continuance of the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
liferent, and with a 100 merks to <HI>Andrew</HI> his second Son
during his life, to whom he gave no part of his heritance.</P>
<P>Here it will be proper to inform your Lordships of <HI>An∣drew's</HI>
situation. It has been already observed, that the Bai∣lie
had become bound with his Son <HI>Andrew,</HI> at his setting up
shop, for L. 200 to <HI>Robert Pringle.</HI> Upon this stock, <HI>Andrew</HI>
carried on business for some time, and dealt with <HI>Snee</HI> and
Company Merchants in London; but his sales not being able
to answer his credit, and his Father refusing to become fur∣ther
bound for him, his London Creditors refused to give
him any more advances, and were threating diligence: to prevent
which, and to bring the Creditors into a composition, it was a∣greed
that he should make over, by assignation, his whole
shop goods, extending to near L. 300 to his Father, who,
about this time. had got right to the debt for which he had
become Cautioner. And the whole goods were put into his
possession; but having got possession thereof, he was persua∣ded,
by some very bad advice, to refuse to give the said En∣lish
Creditors, who were the only other Creditors of <HI>Andrew,</HI>
any share thereof, tho' they were willing to have accepted ten
shillings in the pound. And, for his further security, he ex∣ecuted
a sham-poinding of these goods already in his own
hands; which so irritated the Creditors, that they indorsed
their Bills to Mr <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who brought a process against
the Bailie for payment of their debt, extending to L, 197: 9
: 11; in which the Assignation and Poinding were reduced.
But the Bailie dying before Decreet was pronounced, the pro∣cess
was transferred against the Petitioner, and all the Chil∣dren
of the Bailie of the first and second marriage, and De∣creet
was obtained against them all sor that sum. This cir∣cumstance,
and perhaps some reflections by <HI>Andrew</HI> that his
Father had not acted according to the agreement with him,
was the reason why the Bailie, in the Settlement of his af∣fair's,
gave him nothing but the liferent-annuity of 100 merks.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
The Bailie, about this time, finding himself a dying exe∣cuted
a Settlement of his moveables to the Petitioner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1743</NOTE> Mr.
<HI>Montgomery,</HI> now Commissioner of the Customs. <HI>William
Wardrobe, John Bell,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Chalmer,</HI> as Trustees for
his five daughters of the second marriage, who were autho∣rised
to turn all his moveables into money, to be stock't out
on annual rent, and to be liferented by the Petitioner for the
aliment and education of her children; and in respect he had
sold the houses disponed to <HI>Jean</HI> and <HI>Helen</HI> in the Settlement
1738, he ordained them to secure L. 100 Sterl to each of them,
beside their share of the residue, which they were to draw
with the rest of their Sisters, when the liserent ceased; But
it is expressly provided, That, during the Petitioner's life and
continuing unmarried, she was to have the sole management of
these subjects, and the management of the other Trustees
was only to commence when any one of these events happen∣ed:
so that the Petitioner has no reason to complain that these
Trustees refused to accept of the trust, seeing, during her
life, they could have no power to act. In this deed, the
Trustees are appointed to sell the houses in Cannongate-head,
which he by the deed 1738 had conveyed to <HI>Joseph,</HI> who was
then dead, and to pay the price thereof to the Trustees for
the Creditors of Mr <HI>Mantgomery</HI> of <HI>Wrae,</HI> from whom he had
bought it at a judicial sale.</P>
<P>Bailie <HI>Thomson</HI> having thus settled his affairs, wherein he
did full justice to the Petitioner and her children, died soon
after in opulent circumstances, as was reputed by all that
knew him, both in heritage and moveables, and not above
L. 500 of debt: and after his death, there was a meeting
of some friends for the Respondent with the Petitioner; at
which she complained loudly of the Bailie's Settlements, and
alledged his affairs were in disorder, and that his effects
would not be able to answer his debts, and the other purpo∣se
therein designed: upon which an offer was made for the
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Respondent, that if she would give up her right to the movea∣bles,
she should have sufficient security for L. 500 to herself
and Children, and be freed of all her husband's debts. But
this she absolutely refused; and as she had a right to the
moveables, so she kept possession of them; and she has ac∣knowledged
that she likewise kept possession and uplifted the
rents of all the houses belonging to her husband, except two
or three little houses which the Respondent uplifted the rents
of, which afforded him but a scrimp maintainence; and the
Petitioner, after keeping possession of her Husband's effects,
and carrying on the Brewing and Distilling as formerly, from
the month of April, when her Husband died, to the month
of December, she at last confirmed herself executor, but took
care to give up as little in Inventary, as she could with decency
do.</P>
<P>The Respondent being thus stript of his Father's inheri∣tance,
was about raising a Process for recovering his right,
when a Submission was proposed, which was readily gone into
by him and his Brother <HI>Andrew,</HI> who likewise thought him∣self
injured, as they had not money to carry on processes;
and their disputes were accordingly submitted to Mess.
<HI>George Boswal</HI> and <HI>Andrew Dechar,</HI> who had several meetings
with the parties and their Doers; but in all their meetings,
especially after the 1745, he perceived an evident partiality
in favours of the Petitioner, who got allowance of every
article claimed by her. But this Submission happening to
expire without any Decreet-arbitral being pronounced, the
Respondent was resolved never to submit his affair again to
these Arbiters, and brought a Process against the Petitioner
before the Sheriff, to account for her intromissions with her
Husband's effects, and for freeing him of his Father's mo∣veable
debts.</P>
<P>The Petitioner, afraid of being brought to account, and
anxious to have the Submission renewed to the same Arbiters,
fell upon this stratagem. She paid <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s debt, and
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
took right to his Decreet and Diligence in the name of <HI>Wil∣liam
Richaradson</HI> her Trustee, which Decreet was against her
and all the Representatives of Bailie <HI>Thomson,</HI> and which she,
as sole intromitter with his effects, was obliged to pay; and
upon this diligence a Caption was raised, and the Respondent
was taken, and threatned with being put in prison, unless he
would renew the Submission to the same Arbiters; which he
alsolutely refused; whereupon he was put in prison on the
14th July 1748, an his Brother <HI>Andrew,</HI> who was then in
a dying condition under a decay, came up in the afternoon
to see him, and he was likewise arrested; but no intreaties,
by his wife and her friends, representing the danger he was in
of dying in prison, could prevail with Mr <HI>Richardson,</HI> the Pe∣titioner's
Trustee, and <HI>John Walker,</HI> her Son-in-law and ordi∣nary
Doer, to consent to his liberation, unless the Respondent
and his Brother would sign a new Submission to these Arbi∣ters:
So they past that night in prison, in which <HI>Andrew</HI> had
almost died, which, with the most earnest solicitations of
<HI>Andrew</HI>'s wife and her Cousin Bailie <HI>Blackwood,</HI> and of <HI>George
Balfour, Andrew</HI>'s Doer, induced the Respondent next day to
sign this extraordinary Submission; but at the same time he de∣clared,
that he would rather have lain in prison till he rotted,
than have signed the Submission to these Arbiters, had it not
been out of regard to his Brother, and save his life. And
here its to be observed, that these solicitors were all the friends
of <HI>Andrew,</HI> and acting for him, but had no connection with
the Respondent.</P>
<P>Upon signing of this Submission, they were soon after set
at liberty, and not the least demand was made upon either of
them for payment of the debt upon which they were laid in
prison, nor of any corroborative security therefor. They had
obtained the sole purpose for which they had execute the
Caption; but they took care, that <HI>Richardson,</HI> in whose name
the Caption was, should noit be a party-submitter; so that
Diligence was still kept as an aweband over their heads, in case
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
they should offer to quarrel the Submission on account of its
being extorted from them <HI>metu carceris,</HI> it being in their power
to put it in execution at any time.</P>
<P>Whether the Arbiters had any meetings afterwards before
the signing of the Decreet-arbitral upon the 6th November
following, the Respondent knows not; but one thing he is
sure of, that he never met with them after, nor did he ever
desire or impower his Doer <HI>William Garden</HI> to meet with
them, or to give in any papers or Memorials to them; and,
so far as he knows, Mr <HI>Garden</HI> never met with any of them,
nor gave in any Memorials to them; for he had told him
that he was resolved to quarrel the Submission whenever he
was in a capacity to do it.</P>
<P>The Decreet-arbitral was no sooner put into the Register,
than a Charge was given to the Respondent to obtemper the
Decreet-arbitral; and upon his refusing, a Caption was taken
out, which obliged him to retire to the Abbey, and there he
was narrowly watched for several years with different Mes∣sengers,
in case he should happen at any time to come out of
the Sanctuary. As he was stript of all his Father's inheri∣tance,
and had nothing to live on but the charity of friends,
it was no wonder that he was not able to bring his quarrel of
this Submission and Decreet-arbitral sooner.</P>
<P>The Petitioner having got the Decreet-arbitral absolutely
to her mind, she, for herself and children, and her son-in-law
<HI>John Walker,</HI> led Adjudications against the estate; which
obliged the other Creditors likewise to adjudge; and a process
of Ranking and Sale was carried on in the name of <HI>Richard∣son</HI>
the Petitioner's Trustee, in which a state of the debts
was made out, where she, her children, and <HI>John Walker</HI>
her son-in-law craved to be ranked for no less a sum than
L. 1405: 3: 10 Sterling; which is more than the proven
value of the estate, and would have been tanked accordingly,
of the Respondent had not appeared, and opposed the same;
and this over and above the Pettioner's, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
the whole moveables of her Husband, and the rents of his
estate for 9 years, when the Respondent, the father's eldest
Son, and heir to his mother, who brought so large a part of
this subject with her, is stript of all.</P>
<P>The Respondent hopes he will be excused in giving your
Lordships so full a detail of past transactions, which he thought
himself obliged to do, that your Lordships might have a just
and true view of the matter. He shall now proceed to con∣sider
the several arguments insisted upon for altering the Lord
Ordinary's Interlocutor, twice adhered to by his Lordship.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> is, That there is no legal evidence that the Sub∣mission
was signed in prison. As to which, it is true, that
Mr <HI>Alexander Blackwood</HI> is the only person who depones to
the precise fact of the Submission being signed in prison; but
as he was an instrumentary witness to their signing the Sub∣mission
there, and the only surviving instrumentary witness, it
is submitted to your Lordships, whether his single Deposition
is not a sufficient proof of the fact, in which he could not be
mistaken nor under any doubt, though he uses the pre∣caution,
which every witness is allowed to do, especially when
deponing of facts which happened 12 years before, <Q>That,
to the best of his remembrance, he carried up a scrole
of the proposed Submission to the prisoners, which they
revised; and that they having agreed to the scrole, he
afterwards carried up the Submission extended upon stamp
paper; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he received
both the scrole and principal Submission, either from Mr
<HI>Balfour,</HI> or from Mrs <HI>Thomson,</HI> the prisoner's wife: and
that, to the best of his remembrance, he saw both the said
<HI>James</HI> and <HI>Andrew Thomson</HI>'s sign the said principal Sub∣mission
in the prison; to which, so far as he can recollect,
he is a subscribing witness; and that the Deponent thinks
they were very soon released after signing the Submission.</Q></P>
<P>He also says. <Q>That he remembers that both the said <HI>James</HI>
and <HI>Andrew Thomsons</HI> seemed averse to enter into the said
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
Submission; and that <HI>James</HI> in particular said, he was
afraid it might hurt him with respect to some deeds execute
by his Father in favours of him the said <HI>James.</HI> He
swears likewise to <HI>Andrew</HI>'s bad state of health, and that
his wife was anxious for his liberation, and told him that
their liberation was offered them upon condition of their
signing a Submission; and that, at her desire, he went seve∣ral
times up to prison to perswade him; and that <HI>George
Balfour, Andrew</HI>'s Doer, was with him at some of these
times.</Q> This, the Respondent apprehends, is as full and
satisfying a proof as can be desired, and as could well be ex∣pected,
when the other instrumentary witness is dead. And
it is confirmed in every other circumstance, except the signing
of the Submission in prison, by <HI>Maney Blackwood,</HI> the widow
of <HI>Andrew Thomson,</HI> who, as being more particularly concerned
in the affair than Bailie <HI>Blackwood,</HI> is more pointed and clear
as to several circumstances attending that transaction than he
can be supposed to be at such a distance of time, and in an
affair where he had but an accidental concern. And if this
proof should not be thought sufficient, the Respondent could
yet adduce two other witnesses, <HI>Alexander Henderson</HI> and <HI>James
Brown,</HI> who came up to them in prison, after their signing
the Submission, and were employed by them to go and seek
money to pay the prison-dues, in order to their getting out.</P>
<P>It is next said, That though the fact of signing the Sub∣mission
in prison was proven, yet it was not relevant to set
aside the decreet-arbitral, which is indeavoured to be support∣ed
at great length, and several cases are taken notice of con∣cerning
transactions with debtors in prison for payment of just
debts, or for granting additional securities therefore. But the
Respondent apprehends, that the law is quite clear, by the
Civil law the edict of Praetor was the rule, <HI>Quod metus
causa gestum erit ratum non babebo.</HI> And in the 22d <HI>l. dig.
Quod metus causa in carcerem quem detrusit ut aliquid ei ex∣torqueret,
quid ob banc causam sactum est, nultius momenti est.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
And Lord <HI>Stair, tit. Reparation, parag.</HI> 8. That, by the Prae∣tor's
edict, and the custom of this and other nations, such
deeds and obligations as are by force and fear, are made utter∣ly
void; and he cites a decision very parallel to the present
case, 22d January 1667, <HI>Mair contra Stewart</HI> of <HI>Shambelly,</HI>
where <HI>metus</HI> was sustained to reduce a Bond granted by a par∣ty
taken by Caption, because he was sick. The Respondent
apprehends, that there is no compulsitor in law to oblige a
person to enter into a Submission: That can only be brought
about by the free and voluntary consent of parties; and there∣fore
the using a diligence, which is allowed by law, for re∣covering
payment of a debt, for this purpose, is a perverting
of the law; and the using it so against a person sick and in
danger of dying, was a glaring and gross perverting of the
law, which the Petitioner is forced to own will afford a ground
for reducing these deeds as exported <HI>vi et metu carceris.</HI> The
Respondent might add, That as the Petitioner had possessed
herself of all her Husband's effects, and she has acknowled∣ged
that she had paid that debt, no doubt, out of the
produce of her Husband's effects, as she had no other funds,
he submits it to your Lordships, how far she could have used
that diligence against the Respondent for re-payment of it to
her, as she the executrix had already paid it out of the funds
of her Husband the original debtor; and if she could not, then
all her argument justifying the imprisonment of the Respon∣dent
and his Brother, falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The Respondent apprehends, he needs not take up much
time in answering the several cases founded on by the petitioner
in support of her claim; for in these the intention of impri∣sonment
was to get payment or security, and the debtor was
under an obligation to pay the debt, or to grant further se∣curity
for it, and if he either paid it in prison, of granted
new security for it, he did no more than the law obliged him
to do; and therefore these transactions may be held good in
law, though done in prison; and in these cases the debtor
gave a full consent to the transaction; whereas here the Re∣spondent
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
gave no consent to the thing, and showed to demon∣stration
that he only did it to save his Brother's life, and pro∣cure
personal liberty to both. But, at the same time, it is
certain, that if any iniquity was done to persons in prison by
these transactions, they would be reduced on this head, which
makes a very material difference between these cases and the
present one; for here, if the submission be supported, the De∣creet-arbitral
following thereon, how iniquous soever, cannot
be reduced, iniquity not being one of the grounds of law for re∣ducing
a Decreet-arbitral.</P>
<P>The Petitioner endeavours to justify her insisting on a Sub∣mission
as a reasonable action for settling the mutual claims,
which each party had on one another. But here it will be ob∣served,
that the Petitioner had no claim upon the Respondent,
but to get him to confirm her illegal usurpation of all her
Husband's estate. He indeed had a claim against her, to
restore to him what part of his Father's inheritance he had left
to him, and to free him of his Father's moveable debts, which
she was obliged to do, as intromitter with his moveable effects.
But, from past experience, he had found that he was in no
likelihood to obtain this before the former Arbiters; and
therefore, nothing but to save his Brother's life, could have
induced him to submit his cause again to these Gentlemen.
However good their character may be otherwise, their decern∣ing
such a sum to the Petitioner and her children, and, at the
same time, stripping the Respondent is sufficient to show the
iniquity of their Decreet-arbitral. But he apprehends his
plea for reducing the Submission is good, upon the head of
fear and force.</P>
<P>The Petitioner says, That the Respondent did homologate
the Submission, when he was at liberty, by his Doer <HI>William
Garden,</HI> giving in Memorials and other papers to the Arbiters
upon the subject of the Submission. This has already been
taken notice of, and denied; and it is but very faintly alled∣ged
by the Petitioner; for all she can say on this head is, that
it appears from Mr. <HI>Garden's</HI> compt-book, where he states an
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
article, in his accompt with the Respondent, for drawing a
Memorial to be given in to these Arbiters. How the Peti∣tioner
got access to Mr <HI>Garden</HI>'s compt-books, is not known;
but from her stating it, it does not appear, whether this Me∣morial
was to be given in to the Arbiters, during the depen∣dence
of the first Submission, or of the second. Neither does
it appear whether ever that Memorial was given in to the
Arbiters: But, if it was given in to them, during the second
Submssion, he positively denies that ever he gave Mr <HI>Gar∣den</HI>
any warrant or commission to give in such Memorial.</P>
<P>It is said, in support of his having homologate the Submis∣sion,
that he made no challenge of it for some years, though
he was at his full liberty all the while. Your Lordships will
have observed, from the narrative of the case, that he was
far from being at liberty; the Petitioner had no less than two
Captions against him, one upon <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s debt, and the o∣ther
upon the Decreet-arbitral, and the Messengers hired to
watch him, in case he came out of the Abbey. It was, no
doubt, the Respondent's interest to have brought his quarrel
sooner; but his want of liberty, and especially his want of
money to carry on the process, was the occasion of the delay;
and if he had not got your Lordships <HI>gratis</HI> warrant, he must
have been silent still; at the same time, he apprehends, it
would have been competent to him to have brought his action
any time within forty years.</P>
<P>It is an affected pretence in the Petitioner to say, that she has
lost the vouchers of her accompts, which she looked upon as
unnecessary to be kept for so long a time, by which she could
have supported the Decreet-arbitral in every point; for your
Lordships will have observed, that the Respondent, <HI>de recenti,</HI>
refused to ratify and fulfil the Decreet-arbitral, and said he
would quarrel it whenever he had it in his power; whereupon,
she took a Caption against him; and that being the case, it is
not probable that she has lost any one of her vouchers.</P>
<P>In support of the reasons of reduction before the Lord Or∣dinary,
several particular iniquities committed by the Arbiters,
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
were mentioned, and many more could have been insist∣ed
on; but, as there Were Objections and Answers lying before
his Lordship, to be advised when the Decreet-arbitral should
be set aside, there were only a few noticed, which the Peti∣tioner
has endeavoured to take off, which makes it necessary
for the Respondent to resume them, though he thinks his re∣duction
well founded without them. The <HI>first</HI> was, That
she ought to have shown diligence for setting the houses, and
for recovering the rents and outstanding debts, which the Ar∣biters
had not found her liable to do; upon which it is now
said that iniquity in Arbiters is no ground for reducing their
Decreet-arbitral; and <HI>2dly,</HI> That it would have been impro∣per
for an executor to waste the funds of the executry in do∣ing
diligence for debts, where there was not the smallest pro∣spect
of recovery; but, at this rate, every executor might
have it in his power to do what she pleased with the executry
without being liable to quarrel from any hand; whereas, It
is an established rule in law, That an executor must make up
full inventaries in a cafe, where there is a competition of Clai∣mants,
whether creditors or heirs, and is liable to do diligence
for making the executry effectual, and is obliged to find a
cautioner for that effect. No body, to be sure, would insist
that she should lay out good money in seeking in desperate
debts; but still it was incumbent upon her to shew what of
these debts were desperate, which she was not ordained to do
by the Arbiters.</P>
<P>The Petitioner now has acknowledged, that she has re∣covered
of the executry to the amount of L. 700 Sterling,
and upwards; the Respondent believes she has or might have
recovered a great deal mare as it was reputed to be above L. 1600.
But here a question naturally occurs, What has she done with
this great sum of executry intromitted with by her? The de∣funct's
moveable debts ought naturally to have been paid out of
his executry. Has she done that? it is believed she will not answer
in the affirmative; the debts of her Husband were in and about
L. 500 Sterling; and it appears from the list of debts now in
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
the Ranking, that they are all still outstanding, and not so
much as the annualrent of any of them paid, though be∣sides
this executry intromitted with by her, she had nine years
possession of her husband's heritable estate of L. 164 <HI>per an∣num,</HI>
except the two houses possest by the Respondent; not∣withstanding
whereof the Arbiters find her a Creditor on the
subject for L. 101: 19: 11⅓ Sterling; and L. 95: 6: 6
Sterling.</P>
<P>It was noticed before the Lord Ordinary, that the Arbiters
had committed iniquity in finding the Petitioner intitled to
aliment for her children, which is now said to be highly just,
as their provisions consisted in certain heritable subjects, which
were liferented by their Mother, and that therefore they were
intitled to be alimented with their Father's effects till they came
to enjoy their own provisions. Here an obvious answer will
occur, The Father, by his deed in the 1738, disponed to the
Petitioners children, houses which yielded upwards of L. 90
of rent; and as the Petitioner's two liferents, amounting to
1100 merks, or L. 61: 2: 2 ⅔ Sterling, was laid upon the
Respondent's part of the heritage to the extent of L. 58: 5: 6
Sterl. it is evident that very little of her children's provisions
stood affected with their Mother's liferent: So that if she had
managed matters a-right, there was a sufficiency to have aliment∣ed
her children out to their own provisions; and she had besides
the residue of the executry over payment of the debts made over
to her by her husband. But tho' that had not been the case,
a question would have arisen, in case the estate be bankrupt,
as she pretends, Whether the Creditors would be obliged to
maintain her Children or not, especially when she their Mo∣ther
was peaceably enjoying two jointures extending to 1100
merks, free of all publick burdens? And another question
would have occured, whether the Respondent, as matters
stood by the deeds of his Father, would have been obliged
to aliment his Brothers and Sisters, supposing the estate had
not been bankrupt?</P>
<P>Another article of complaint against the Decreet-arbitral
mentioned before the Ordinary was, That the expenses of
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
repairs of the houses which she had in liferent from her last
Husband were allowed her, through that was not provided
in the Contract of Marriage, to which it is now said that the
husband became bound that the houses should yield 600
merks free of all taxations and publick burdens. But repa∣ration
of liferented houses, is a burden upon the liserenter,
and is neither to be accounted a taxation or publick burden.</P>
<P>The Petitioner, in the <HI>last</HI> place, endeavours to make an
apology for the smalness of the rent accounted for by her for
the five years of her intromission preceeding the Decreet∣arbitral,
when compared with the five years rents uplifted by
your Lordships Factor, when the estate was sequestrate, and
says, that sundry of the houses were waste and in bad repair,
and that the sums laid out by her in reparing them, made
them set better afterwards. But here it is to be observed,
that, after all her repairs, the highest rent she brings up the
houses to in the last year of her intromission, is but L. 129
and some odd shillings, whereas the Factor's rental is L. 164.</P>
<P>And, upon the whole, the Petitioner concludes, that there
is no good exception against the justice of the Decreet-arbi∣tral,
and that there is no relevant ground in law for reducing
this Submission, and that iniquity is no relevant ground for
reducing the Decreet-arbitral. The Respondent apprehends,
that he has much better ground to say, that the Decreet-arbi∣tral
is in every particular iniquous, and that whether it was
iniquous or not, he is founded in law to reduce the Submission,
the signing of which was elicit from him and his Brother
<HI>metu carceris;</HI> and that the petitioner, by her extraordinary,
illegal and unwarrantable management of her husband and
childrens affairs, has occasioned difficulties, and probably loss,
which may not be easily recovered from her, and she in the
mean time is quietly in possession of 1100 merks free of public
burdens, tho' she has only now two of her six children with
her, while the Respondent, the heir, has not a farthing of his
Father's effects to live upon, which he hopes will merit the
consideration of the Court.</P>
