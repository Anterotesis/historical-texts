<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the
Countess of HERTFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE always obser∣ved
that, in Addresses of
this Nature, the general
Taste of the World de∣mands
ingenious Turns of Wit, and
<PB REF="5"/>
disguised artful Periods, instead of
an open Sincerity of Sentiment flow∣ing
in a plain Expression. From
what secret Impatience of the justest
Praise, when bestowed on Others,
this often proceeds, rather than a
pretended Delicacy, is beyond my
Purpose here to enquire. But as no∣thing
is more foreign to the Dispo∣sition
of a Soul sincerely pleased
with the Contemplation of what is
beautiful, and excellent, than Wit and
Turn; I have too much Respect for
your Ladyship's Character, either to
touch it in that gay, trifling Man∣ner,
or venture on a particular Detail
<PB REF="6"/>
of those truly amiable Qualities of
which it is composed. A Mind ex∣alted,
pure, and elegant, a Heart
overflowing with Humanity, and the
whole Train of Virtues thence deri∣ved,
that give a pleasing Spirit to
Conversation, an engaging Simplici∣ty
to the Manners, and form the Life
to Harmony, are rather to be felt,
and silently admired, than expressed.
I have attempted, in the following
Poem, to paint some of the most
tender Beauties, and delicate Appear∣ances
of Nature; how much in vain,
your Ladyship's Taste will, I am
afraid, but too soon discover: Yet
<PB REF="7"/>
would it still be a much easier Task
to find Expression for all that Va∣riety
of Colour, Form, and Fra∣grance,
which enrich the Season I
describe, than to speak the many
nameless Graces, and Native Riches
of a Mind capable so much at once
to relish Solitude, and adorn So∣ciety.
To whom then could these
Sheets be more properly inscribed
than to You, MADAM, whose In∣fluence
in the World can give them
the Protection they want, while
your fine Imagination, and intimate
Acquaintance with <HI>Rural Nature,</HI> will
recommend them with the greatest
<PB REF="8"/>
Advantage to your favourable No∣tice?
Happy! if I have hit any
of those Images, and correspon∣dent
Sentiments, your calm Even∣ing
Walks, in the most delightful
Retirement, have oft inspired. I
could add too, that as this Poem
grew up under your Encourage∣ment,
it has therefore a natural
Claim to your Patronage. Should
You read it with Approbation, it's
Musick shall not droop; and should
it have the good Fortune to de∣serve
your Smiles, it's Roses shall
not wither. But, where the Sub∣ject
is so tempting, lest I begin
<PB REF="9"/>
my Poem before the Dedication is
ended, I here break short, and beg
Leave to subscribe my self, with
the highest Respect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most Obedient,
Humble Servant,
JAMES THOMSON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the following Poem appears at present
in Publick, is not any way in Prejudice of
the Proposals I lately Published for Printing the
<HI>FOUR SEASONS, &amp;c.</HI> by Subscription, but
at the Solicitation of some of my Friends who
had seen it in Manuscript, and the better to
carry on a Work I stand engaged to finish.
For <HI>Subscription</HI> is now at its last Gasp,
and the World seems to have got the better of
that many-headed Monster. However, those
Gentlemen and Ladies who have been, or
may hereafter be so good as to honour me
with their Names, shall have the Book next
Winter according to my Proposals: And if
it should, in any Degree, be judged worthy their
Encouragement, I have my best Reward.</P>

<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>OME, gentle SPRING, Aetherial Mildness,
come,</L>
<L>And from the Bosom of yon dropping Cloud,</L>
<L>While Music wakes around, veil'd in a Shower</L>
<L>Of shadowing Roses, on our Plains descend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH HERTFORD, fitted, or to shine in Courts</L>
<L>With unaffected Grace, or walk the Plain,</L>
<L>With <HI>Innocence,</HI> and <HI>Meditation</HI> join'd</L>
<L>In soft Assemblage, listen to my Song,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="12"/>
Which thy own Season paints, when Nature all</L>
<L>Is blooming, and benevolent like Thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND see where surly WINTER passes off,</L>
<L>Far to the North, and calls his ruffian Blasts;</L>
<L>His Blasts obey, and quit the howling Hill,</L>
<L>The shatter'd Forest, and the ravag'd Vale:</L>
<L>While softer Gales succeed, at whose kind Touch,</L>
<L>Dissolving Snows in sudden Torrents lost,</L>
<L>The Mountains lift their green Heads to the Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As yet the trembling Year is unconfirm'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Winter</HI> oft at Eve resumes the Breeze,</L>
<L>Chills the pale Morn, and bids his driving Sleets</L>
<L>Deform the Day delightless; so that scarce</L>
<L>The Bittern knows his Time, with Bill ingulpht</L>
<L>To shake the sounding Marsh; or from the Shore</L>
<L>The Plovers theirs, to scatter o'er the Heath,</L>
<L>And sing their wild Notes to the listening Waste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
<L>At last from <HI>Aries</HI> rolls the bounteous Sun,</L>
<L>And the bright <HI>Bull</HI> receives Him. Then no more</L>
<L>Th' expansive Atmosphere is cramp'd with Cold,</L>
<L>But full of Life, and vivifying Soul,</L>
<L>Lifts the light Clouds sublime, and spreads them thin,</L>
<L>Fleecy, and white, o'er All-surrounding Heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FORTH fly the tepid Aires; and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Unbinding Earth, the moving Softness strays.</L>
<L>Joyous th' impatient Husbandman perceives</L>
<L>Relenting Nature, and his lusty Steers</L>
<L>Drives from their Stalls, to where the well-us'd Plow</L>
<L>Lies in the Furrow loosen'd from the Frost.</L>
<L>There, unrefusing to the harness'd yoke,</L>
<L>They lend their Shoulder, and begin their Toil,</L>
<L>Chear'd by the simple Song, and soaring Lark.</L>
<L>Mean-while incumbent o'er the shining Share</L>
<L>The Master leans, removes th' obstructing Clay,</L>
<L>Winds the whole Work, and side-long lays the Glebe.</L>

WHITE thro' the neighbring Fields the Sower
stalks,</L>
<L>With measur'd Step, and liberal throws the Grain</L>

<L>The Harrow follows harsh, and shuts the Scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BE gracious, <HI>Heaven!</HI> for now laborious Man</L>
<L>Has done his Due. Ye fostering Breezes blow!</L>
<L>Ye softening Dews, ye tender Showers descend!</L>
<L>And temper all, thou influential Sun,</L>
<L>Into the perfect Year! Nor, Ye who live</L>
<L>In Luxury and Ease, in Pomp and Pride,</L>
<L>Think these lost Themes unworthy of your Ear.</L>
<L>'Twas such as these the <HI>Rural Maro</HI> sung</L>
<L>To the full <HI>Roman</HI> Court, in all it's height</L>
<L>Of Elegance and <HI>Taste.</HI> The sacred Plow</L>
<L>Employ'd the Kings and Fathers of Mankind,</L>
<L>In antient Times. And Some, with whom compar'd</L>
<L>You're but the Beings of a Summer's Day,</L>
<L>Have held the Scale of Justice, shook the Launce</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="15"/>
Of mighty War, then With descending Hand,</L>
<L>Unus'd to little Delicacies, feiz'd</L>
<L>The Plow, and greatly independant liv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YE generous <HI>Britons</HI> cultivate the Plow!</L>
<L>And o'er your Hills, and long with-drawing Vales,</L>
<L>Let <HI>Autumn</HI> spread his Treasures to the Sun,</L>
<L>Luxuriant, and unbounded. As the Sea,</L>
<L>Far thro' his azure, turbulent Extent,</L>
<L>Your Empire owns, and from a thousand Shores</L>
<L>Wafts all the Pomp of Life into your Ports,</L>
<L>So with superior Boon may your rich Soil,</L>
<L>Exuberant, Nature's better Blessings pour</L>
<L>O'er every Land; the naked Nations cloath.</L>
<L>And be th' exhaustless Granary of the World.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR thro' the lenient Air alone, this Change</L>
<L>Delicious breathes; the penetrative Sun,</L>
<L>His Force deep-darting to the dark Retreat</L>
<L>Of Vegetation, sets the steaming Power</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="16"/>
At large, to wander o'er the vernant Earth</L>
<L>In various Hues, but chiefly Thee, gay <HI>Green!</HI></L>
<L>Thou smiling <HI>Nature</HI>'s universal Robe!</L>
<L>United Light and Shade! where the Sight dwells</L>
<L>With growing Strength, and ever-new Delight!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FROM the moist Meadow to the brown-brow'd Hill,</L>
<L>Led by the Breeze, the vivid Verdure runs,</L>
<L>And swells, and deepens to the cherish'd Eye.</L>
<L>The Hawthorn whitens; and the juicy Groves</L>
<L>Put forth their Buds, unfolding by Degrees,</L>
<L>Till the whole leafy Forest stands display'd</L>
<L>In full Luxuriance, to the sighing Gales,</L>
<L>While the Deer rustle thro' the twining Brake,</L>
<L>And the Birds sing conceal'd. At once array'd</L>
<L>In all the Colours of the flushing Year,</L>
<L>By <HI>Nature</HI>'s swift and secret-working Hand,</L>
<L>The Garden glows, and fills the liberal Air</L>
<L>With lavish Fragrance; while the promis'd Fruit</L>
<L>Lies yet a little Embrio, unperceiv'd,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="17"/>
Within it's Crimson Folds. Now from the Town</L>
<L>Buried in Smoak, and Sleep, and noisome Damps,</L>
<L>Oft let me wander o'er the dewy Fields,</L>
<L>Where Freshness breathes, and dash the lucid Drops</L>
<L>From the bent Bush, as thro' the fuming Maze</L>
<L>Of Sweet-Briar Hedges I pursue my Walk;</L>
<L>Or taste the Smell of Dairy; or ascend</L>
<L>Some Eminence, <HI>Augusta,</HI> in thy Plains,</L>
<L>And see the Country far-diffus'd around</L>
<L>One boundless Blush, one snow-empurpled Shower</L>
<L>Of mingled Blossoms, where the raptur'd Eye</L>
<L>Travels from Joy to Joy, and, hid beneath</L>
<L>The fair Profusion, yellow <HI>Autumn</HI> spies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF brush'd from <HI>Russian</HI> Wilds a cutting Gale</L>
<L>Rise not, and scatter from his foggy Wings</L>
<L>The bitter Mildew, or dry-blowing breathe</L>
<L>Untimely Frost; before whose baleful Blast,</L>
<L>The full-blown <HI>Spring</HI> thro' all her Foliage shrinks.</L>
<L>Into a smutty, wide-dejected Waste.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="18"/>
For oft engender'd by the hazy North,</L>
<L>Myriads on Myriads, Insect-Armies waft</L>
<L>Keen in the poison'd Breeze; and wasteful eat</L>
<L>Thro' Buds, and Bark, even to the Heart of Oak</L>
<L>Their eager Way. A feeble Race! scarce seen,</L>
<L>Save to the prying Eye; yet Famine waits</L>
<L>On their corrosive Course, and starves the Year.</L>
<L>Sometimes o'er Cities as they steer their Flight,</L>
<L>Where rising Vapour melts their Wings away,</L>
<L>Gaz'd by th' astonish'd Crowd, the horrid Shower</L>
<L>Descends. And hence the skillful Farmer Chaff</L>
<L>And blazing Straw before his Orchard burns,</L>
<L>Till all involv'd in Smoak the latent Foe</L>
<L>From every Cranny suffocated falls;</L>
<L>Or Onions steaming hot beneath his Trees</L>
<L>Exposes, fatal to the frosty Tribe:</L>
<L>Nor, from their friendly Task, the busy Bill</L>
<L>Of little trooping Birds instinctive scares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE are not idle Philosophic Dreams;</L>
<L>Full Nature swarms with Life. Th' unfaithful Fen</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="19"/>
In putrid Steams emits the living Cloud</L>
<L>Of Pestilence. Thro' subterranean Cells,</L>
<L>Where searching Sun-Beams never found a Way,</L>
<L>Earth animated heaves. The flowery Leaf</L>
<L>Wants not it's soft Inhabitants. The Stone,</L>
<L>Hard as it is, in every winding Pore</L>
<L>Holds Multitudes. But chief the Forest-Boughs,</L>
<L>Which dance unnumber'd to th' inspiring Breeze,</L>
<L>The downy Orchard, and the melting Pulp</L>
<L>Of mellow Fruit the nameless Nations feed</L>
<L>Of evanescent Insects. Where the Pool</L>
<L>Stands mantled o'er with Green, invisible,</L>
<L>Amid the floating Verdure Millions stray.</L>
<L>Each Liquid too, whether of acid Taste,</L>
<L>Milky, or strong, with various Forms abounds.</L>
<L>Nor is the lucid Stream, nor the pure Air,</L>
<L>Tho' one transparent Vacancy they seem,</L>
<L>Devoid of theirs. Even Animals subsist</L>
<L>On Animals, in infinite Descent;</L>
<L>And all so fine adjusted, that the Loss</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="20"/>
Of the least Species would disturb the whole.</L>
<L>Stranger than this th' inspective Glass confirms,</L>
<L>And to the Curious gives th' amazing Scenes</L>
<L>Of lessning Life; by <HI>Wisdom</HI> kindly hid</L>
<L>From Eye, and Ear of Man: for if at once</L>
<L>The Worlds in Worlds enclos'd were push'd to Light,</L>
<L>Seen by his sharpen'd Eye, and by his Ear</L>
<L>Intensely bended Heard, from the choice Cate,</L>
<L>The freshest Viands, and the brightest Wines,</L>
<L>He'd turn abhorrent, and in Dead of Night,</L>
<L>When Silence sleeps o'er all, be stun'd with Noise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE North-East spends his Rage, and now shut up</L>
<L>Within his Iron Caves, th' effusive South</L>
<L>Warms the wide Air, and o'er the Void of Heaven</L>
<L>Breathes the big Clouds with vernal Showers distent.</L>
<L>At first a dusky Wreath they seem to rise,</L>
<L>Scarce staining Aether; but by fast Degrees,</L>
<L>In Heaps on Heaps, the doubling Vapour sails</L>
<L>Along the loaded Sky, and mingling thick</L>
<L>Sits on th' Horizon round a settled Gloom.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="21"/>
Not such as wintry Storms on Mortals shed</L>
<L>Oppressing Life, but lovely, gentle, kind,</L>
<L>And full of every Hope, and every Joy,</L>
<L>The Wish of Nature. Gradual sinks the Breeze</L>
<L>Into a perfect Calm; that not a Breath</L>
<L>Is heard to quiver thro' the closing Woods,</L>
<L>Or rustling turn the many-twinkling Leaves</L>
<L>Of Aspin tall. Th' uncurling Floods, diffus'd</L>
<L>In glassy Breadth, seem thro' delusive Lapse</L>
<L>Forgetful of their Course.'Tis Silence all,</L>
<L>And pleasing Expectation. Herds and Flocks</L>
<L>Drop the dry Sprig, and mute-imploring eye</L>
<L>The falling Verdure. Hush'd in short Suspense</L>
<L>The plumy People streak their Wings with Oil,</L>
<L>And wait th' approaching Sign to strike at once</L>
<L>Into the general Choir. Ev'n Mountains, Vales,</L>
<L>And Forests seem expansive to demand</L>
<L>The promis'd Sweetness, Man superior walks</L>
<L>Amid the glad Creation, musing Praise,</L>
<L>And looking lively Gratitude. At last</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="22"/>
The Clouds consign their Treasures to the Fields,</L>
<L>And, softly shking on the dimply Pool</L>
<L>Prelusive Drops, let all their Moisture flow</L>
<L>In large Effusion o'er the freshen'd World.</L>
<L>'Tis scarce to patter heard, the stealing Shower,</L>
<L>By such as wander thro' the Forest-Walks,</L>
<L>Beneath th' umbrageous Multitude of Leaves.</L>
<L>But who would hold the Shade, while <HI>Heaven</HI> descends</L>
<L>In universal Bounty, shedding Herbs,</L>
<L>And Fruits, and Flowers, on <HI>Nature</HI>'s ample Lap?</L>
<L>Imagination fir'd prevents their Growth,</L>
<L>And while the verdant Nutriment distills,</L>
<L>Beholds the kindling Country colour round,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS all Day long the full-distended Clouds</L>
<L>Indulge their genial Stores, and well-showr'd Earth</L>
<L>Is deep enrich'd with vegetable Life;</L>
<L>Till, in the Western Sky, the downward Sun</L>
<L>Looks out illustrious from amid the Flush</L>
<L>Of broken Clouds, gay-shifting to his Beam.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="23"/>
The rapid Radiance instantaneous strikes</L>
<L>Th' illumin'd Mountain, thro' the Forest streams,</L>
<L>Shakes on the Floods, and in a yellow Mist,</L>
<L>Far-smoaking o'er th' interminable Plain,</L>
<L>In twinkling Myriads lights the dewy Gems.</L>
<L>Moist, bright, and green, the Landskip laughs around.</L>
<L>Full swell the Woods; their every Musick wakes,</L>
<L>Mix'd in wild Consort with the warbling Brooks</L>
<L>Increas'd, th' unnumber'd Bleatings of the Hills,</L>
<L>The hollow Lows responsive from the Vales,</L>
<L>Whence blending all the sweeten'd Zephir springs.</L>
<L>Mean-time retracted from yon Eastern Cloud,</L>
<L>Bestriding Earth, the grand aetherial Bow</L>
<L>Shoots up immense! and every Hue unfolds,</L>
<L>In fair Proportion, running from the Red,</L>
<L>To where the Violet fades into the Sky.</L>
<L>Here, mighty <HI>Newton,</HI> the dissolving Clouds</L>
<L>Are, as they scatter round, thy numerous Prism,</L>
<L>Untwisting to the Philosophic Eye</L>
<L>The various Twine os Light, by Thee pursu'd</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="24"/>
Thro' all the mingling Maze. Not so the Swain,</L>
<L>He wondering views the bright Enchantment bend,</L>
<L>Delightful, o'er the radiant Fields, and runs</L>
<L>To catch the falling Glory, but amaz'd</L>
<L>Beholds th' amusive Arch before him fly,</L>
<L>Then vanish quite away. Still Night succeeds,</L>
<L>A soften'd Shade; and saturated Earth</L>
<L>Awaits the Morning Beam, to give again,</L>
<L>Transmuted soon by Nature's Chymistry,</L>
<L>The blooming Blessings of the former Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN spring the living Herbs, profusely wild</L>
<L>O'er all the deep-green Earth, beyond the Power</L>
<L>Of <HI>Botanist▪</HI> to number up their Tribes;</L>
<L>Whether he steals along the lonely Dale</L>
<L>In silent Search; or thro' the Forest, rank</L>
<L>With what the dull Incurious Weeds account,</L>
<L>Bursts his blind Way; or climbs the Mountain-Rock,</L>
<L>Fir'd by the nodding Verdure of its Brow.</L>
<L>With such a liberal Hand has <HI>Nature</HI> slung</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="25"/>
Their Seeds abroad, blown them about in Winds,</L>
<L>Innumerous mix'd then with the nursing Mold,</L>
<L>The moistening Current, and prolific Rain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT who their Virtues can declare? who pierce</L>
<L>With holy Eye into these secret Stores</L>
<L>Of Life, and Health, and Joy? The Food of Man</L>
<L>While yet he liv'd in Innocence, and told</L>
<L>A Length of golden Years, unflesh'd in Blood,</L>
<L>A Stranger to the Savage Arts of Life,</L>
<L>Death, Rapine, Carnage, Surfeit, and Disease,</L>
<L>The Lord, and not the Tyrant of the World.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN the glad Morning wak'd the gladden'd Race</L>
<L>Of uncorrupted Men, nor blush'd to see</L>
<L>The Sluggard sleep beneath her sacred Beam.</L>
<L>For their light Slumbers gently fum'd away,</L>
<L>And up they rose as vigorous as the Sun,</L>
<L>Or to the Culture of the willing Glebe,</L>
<L>Or to the chearful Tendance of the Flock.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="26"/>
Mean-time the Song went round; and Dance, and Sport,</L>
<L>Wisdom, and friendly Talk successive stole</L>
<L>Their Hours away. While in the rosy Vale</L>
<L>Love breath'd his Infant Sighs, from Anguish free,</L>
<L>Fragrant with Bliss, and only wept for Joy.</L>
<L>Nor yet injurious Act, nor surly Deed</L>
<L>Was known among these happy Sons of Heaven;</L>
<L>For Reason and Benevolence were Law.</L>
<L>Harmonious Nature too look'd smiling on.</L>
<L>Clean shone the Skies, cool'd with eternal Gales,</L>
<L>And balmy Spirit all. The youthful Sun</L>
<L>Shot his best Rays; and still the gracious Clouds</L>
<L>Drop'd Fatness down; as o'er the swelling Mead</L>
<L>The Herds and Flocks commixing play'd secure.</L>
<L>Which when, emergent from the gloomy Wood,</L>
<L>The glaring Lyon saw, his horrid Heart</L>
<L>Was meeken'd, and he join'd his sullen Joy.</L>
<L>For Musick held the whole in perfect Peace:</L>
<L>Soft sigh'd the Flute; the tender Voice was heard</L>
<L>Warbling the joyous Heart; the Woodlands round</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="27"/>
Apply'd their Quire; and Winds and Waters flow'd</L>
<L>In Consonance.—Such were these Prime of Days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS to the <HI>Poets</HI> gave the golden Age;</L>
<L>When, as they sung in Allegoric Phraze,</L>
<L>The Sailor-Pine had not the Nations yet</L>
<L>In Commerce mix'd; for every Country teem'd</L>
<L>With every Thing. Spontaneous Harvests wav'd</L>
<L>Still in a Sea of yellow Plenty round.</L>
<L>The Forest was the Vineyard, where untaught</L>
<L>To climb, unprun'd, and wild, the juicy Grape</L>
<L>Burst into Floods of Wine. The knotted Oak</L>
<L>Shook from his Boughs the long transparent Streams</L>
<L>Of Honey, creeping thro' the matted Grass.</L>
<L>Th' uncultivated Thorn a ruddy Shower</L>
<L>Of Fruitage shed, on such as sat below,</L>

Nor had the spongy, full-expanded Fleece</L>

<L>Dejected wanders, nor th' inticing Bud</L>

<L>And groaning vast th' impetuous Battel mix:</L>
<L>While the fair Heifer, redolent, in View</L>

<L>With this hot Impulse seiz'd in every Nerve,</L>
<L>Nor hears the Rein, nor heeds the sounding Whip;</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="51"/>
Blows are not felt; but tossing high his Head,</L>
<L>And by the well-known Joy to distant Plains</L>
<L>Attracted strong, all wild, he bursts away;</L>
<L>O'er Rocks, and Woods, and craggy Mountains flies,</L>
<L>And neighing on th' aerial Summit takes</L>
<L>Th' informing Gale; then steep-descending stems</L>
<L>The headlong Torrents foaming down the Hills,</L>
<L>Even where the Madness of the straiten'd Stream</L>
<L>Turns in black Eddies round: Such is the Force</L>
<L>With which his frantic Heart, and Sinews swell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR, undelighted by the boundless <HI>Spring,</HI></L>
<L>Are the broad Monsters of the Deep: thro' all</L>
<L>Their oozy Caves, and gelid Kingdoms rous'd,</L>
<L>They flounce, and tumble in unwieldy Joy.</L>
<L>Dire were the Strain, and dissonant, to sing</L>
<L>The cruel Raptures of the Savage Kind;</L>
<L>How the red Lioness, her Whelps forgot</L>
<L>Amid the thoughtless Fury of her Heart,</L>
<L>The lank rapacious Wolf, th' unshapely Bear,</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="52"/>
The spotted Tyger, fellest of the Fell,</L>
<L>And all the Terrors of the <HI>Lybian</HI> Swain,</L>
<L>By this new Flame their Native Wrath sublim'd,</L>

<L>Where sits the Shepherd on the grassy Turf,</L>

<L>Of various Cadence; and his sportive Lambs,</L>
<L>This way and that convolv'd in friskful Glee,</L>
<L>Their little Frolicks play. And now the Race</L>
<L>Invites them forth; when swift, the Signal given,</L>
<L>They start away, and sweep the circly Mound</L>
<L>That runs around the Hill; the Rampart once</L>
<L>Of Iron War, in antient barbarous Times,</L>
<L>When disunited <HI>Britain</HI> ever bled,</L>
<L>Lost in eternal Broil; ere yet she grew</L>
<L>To this deep-laid, indissoluble State,</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="53"/>
Where <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> lift their golden Head,</L>
<L>And o'er our Labours <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Law</HI></L>
<L>Illustrious watch, the Wonder of a World!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT is this <HI>mighty Breath,</HI> ye Curious, say,</L>
<L>Which, in a Language rather felt than heard,</L>
<L>Instructs the Fowls of Heaven; and thro' their Breasts</L>
<L>These Arts of Love diffuses?—What? but <HI>GOD!</HI></L>
<L>Inspiring <HI>GOD!</HI> who boundless Spirit all,</L>
<L>And unremitting Energy, pervades,</L>

<L>He ceaseless works alone, and yet alone</L>
<L>Seems not to work, so exquisitely fram'd</L>
<L>Is this complex, amazing Scene of Things.</L>
<L>But tho' conceal'd, to every purer Eye</L>
<L>Th' informing Author in his Works appears;</L>
<L>His Grandeur in the Heavens: the Sun, and Moon,</L>
<L>Whether that fires the Day, or falling this</L>
<L>Pours out a lucid Softness o'er the Night,</L>
<L>Are but a Beam from Him. The glittering Stars,</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="54"/>
By the deep Ear of Meditation heard,</L>
<L>Still in their Midnight Watches sing of Him.</L>
<L>He nods a Calm. The Tempest blows His Wrath,</L>
<L>Roots up the Forest, and o'erturns the Main.</L>
<L>The Thunder is His Voice; and the red Flash</L>
<L>His speedy Sword of Justice. At His Touch</L>
<L>The Mountains flame. He takes the solid Earth,</L>
<L>And rocks the Nations. Nor in these alone,</L>
<L>In every common Instance <HI>GOD</HI> is seen;</L>
<L>And to the Man, who casts his mental Eye</L>
<L>Abroad, unnotic'd Wonders rise. But chief</L>
<L>In Thee, Boon <HI>Spring,</HI> and in thy softer Scenes,</L>
<L>The <HI>Smiling GOD</HI> appears; while Water, Earth,</L>
<L>And Air attest his Bounty, which instils</L>
<L>Into the Brutes this temporary Thought,</L>
<L>And annual melts their undesigning Hearts</L>
<L>Profusely thus in Tenderness, and Joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>STILL let my Song a nobler. Note assume,</L>
<L>And sing th' infusive Force of <HI>Spring</HI> on Man;</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="55"/>
When Heaven and Earth, as if contending, vie</L>
<L>To raise his Being, and serene his Soul.</L>
<L>Can he forbear to smile with <HI>Nature?</HI> Can</L>
<L>The stormy Passions in his Bosom rowl,</L>
<L>While every Gale is Peace, and every Grove</L>
<L>Is Melody? Hence, from the bounteous Walks</L>

<L>But come, ye generous Breasts, in whose wide Thought,</L>
<L>Of all his Works, <HI>Creative Bounty,</HI> most,</L>
<L>Divinely burns; and on your open Front,</L>
<L>And liberal Eye, sits, from his dark Retreat</L>
<L>Inviting modest Want. Nor only fair,</L>
<L>And easy of Approach; your active Search</L>
<L>Leaves no cold wintry Corner unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Like silent-working <HI>Heaven,</HI> surprizing oft</L>
<L>The lonely Heart with unexpected Good.</L>
<L>For you the roving Spirit of the Wind</L>
<L>Blows <HI>Spring</HI> abroad, for you the teeming Clouds</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="56"/>
Descend in buxom Plenty o'er the World,</L>
<L>And the Sun spreads his genial Blaze for you,</L>
<L>Ye flower of Human Race! In these green Days,</L>
<L>Sad-pining Sickness lifts her languid Head;</L>
<L>Life flows afresh; and young-ey'd Health exalts</L>
<L>The whole Creation round. Contentment walks</L>
<L>The Sunny Glade, and feels an inward Bliss</L>
<L>Spring o'er his Mind, beyond the Pride of Kings</L>
<L>E'er to bestow. Serenity apace</L>
<L>Induces Thought, and Contemplation still.</L>
<L>By small Degrees the Love of Nature works,</L>
<L>And warms the Bosom; till at last arriv'd</L>
<L>To Rapture, and enthusiastic Heat,</L>
<L>We feel the present <HI>Deity,</HI> and taste</L>
<L>The Joy of <HI>GOD,</HI> to see a happy World.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis <HI>Harmony,</HI> that World-embracing Power,</L>
<L>By which all Beings are adjusted, each</L>
<L>To all around, impelling and impell'd</L>
<L>In endless Circulation, that inspires</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="57"/>
This universal Smile. Thus the glad Skies,</L>
<L>The wide-rejoycing Earth, the Woods, the Streams,</L>
<L>With every <HI>Life</HI> they hold, down to the Flower</L>
<L>That paints the lowly Vale, or Insect-Wing</L>
<L>Wav'd o'er the Shepherd's Slumber, touch the Mind</L>
<L>To Nature tun'd, with a light-flying Hand,</L>
<L>Invisible, quick-urging, thro' the Nerves,</L>
<L>The glittering Spirits, in a Flood of Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HENCE from the Virgin's Cheek, a fresher Bloom</L>
<L>Shoots, less and less, the live Carnation round;</L>
<L>Her Lips blush deeper Sweets; she breathes of Youth;</L>
<L>The shining Moisture swells into her Eyes,</L>
<L>In brighter Flow; her wishing Bosom heaves</L>
<L>With Palpitations wild; kind Tumults seize</L>
<L>Her Veins, and all her yielding Soul is Love.</L>
<L>From the keen Gaze her Lover turns away,</L>
<L>Full of the dear ecstatic Power, and sick</L>
<L>With sighing Languishment. Ah then, ye Fair!</L>
<L>Be greatly cautious of your sliding Hearts;</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="58"/>
Dare not th' infectious Sigh, the pleading Eye</L>
<L>In meek Submission drest, deject, and low,</L>
<L>But full of tempting Guile. Let not the Tongue,</L>
<L>Prompt to deceive, with Adulation smooth,</L>
<L>Gain on your purpos'd Wills. Nor in the Bower,</L>
<L>Where Woodbines flaunt, and Roses shed a Couch,</L>
<L>While Evening draws her crimson'd Curtains round,</L>
<L>Trust your soft Minutes with betraying Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND let th' aspiring Youth beware of Love,</L>
<L>And shun th' enchanting Glance, for 'tis too late</L>
<L>When on his Heart the Torrent Softness pours.</L>
<L>Then Interest sinks to Dirt, and distant Fame</L>
<L>Dissolves in Air away. While the fond Soul</L>
<L>Is wrapt in Dreams of Ecstacy, and Bliss;</L>
<L>Still paints th' illusive Form, the kindling Grace,</L>
<L>Th' alluring Smile, the full aethereal Eye</L>
<L>Effusing Heaven; and listens ardent still</L>
<L>To the small Voice, where Harmony and Wit,</L>
<L>A modest, melting, mingled Sweetness, flow.</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="59"/>
No sooner is the fair Idea form'd,</L>
<L>And Contemplation fixes on the Theme,</L>
<L>Than from his own Creation wild He flies,</L>
<L>Sick of a Shadow. Absence comes apace,</L>
<L>And shoots his every Pang into his Breast.</L>
<L>'Tis nought but Gloom around. The darken'd Sun</L>
<L>Loses his Light. The rosy-bosom'd <HI>Spring</HI></L>
<L>To weeping Fancy pines; and yon bright Arch</L>
<L>Of Heaven low-bends into a dusky Vault.</L>
<L>All Nature fades extinct; and She alone</L>
<L>Heard, felt, and seen, possesses every Thought,</L>
<L>Fills every Sense, and pants in every Vein.</L>
<L>Books are but formal Dulness, tedious Friends,</L>
<L>And sad amid the Social Band he sits,</L>
<L>Lonely, and inattentive. From the Tongue</L>
<L>Th' unfinish'd Period falls: white, born away</L>
<L>On swelling Thought, his wafted Spirit flies</L>
<L>To the dear Bosom of his absent Fair;</L>
<L>And leaves the Semblance of a Lover, fix'd</L>
<L>In melancholy Site, with Head declin'd,</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="60"/>
And Love-dejected Eyes. Sudden he starts,</L>
<L>Shook from his tender Trance, and restless runs</L>
<L>To glimmering Shades, and sympathetic Glooms,</L>
<L>Where the dun Umbrage o'er the falling Stream</L>
<L>Romantic hangs; there thro' the pensive Dusk</L>
<L>Strays, in Heart-thrilling Meditation lost,</L>
<L>Indulging all to Love: or on the Bank</L>
<L>Thrown, amid drooping Lillies, swells the Breeze</L>
<L>With Sighs unceasing, and the Brook with Tears.</L>
<L>Thus in soft Anguish he consumes the Day;</L>
<L>Nor quits his deep Retirement, till the Moon</L>
<L>Peeps thro' the Chambers of the fleecy East,</L>
<L>Enlighten'd by Degrees, and in her Train</L>
<L>Leads on the gentle Hours; then forth He walks,</L>
<L>Beneath the trembling Languish of her Beams,</L>
<L>With soften'd Soul, and wooes the Bird of Eve</L>
<L>To mingle Woes with his: or while the World,</L>
<L>And all the Sons of Care lie hush'd in Sleep,</L>
<L>Associates with the Mid-night Shadows drear,</L>
<L>And, sighing to the lonely Taper, pours</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="61"/>
His sweetly-tortur'd Heart into the Page</L>
<L>Meant for the moving Messenger of Love.</L>
<L>But ah how faint, how meaningless, and poor</L>
<L>To what his Passion swells! which bursts the Bounds</L>
<L>Of every Eloquence, and asks for Looks,</L>
<L>Where Fondness flows on Fondness, Love on Love;</L>
<L>Entwisting Beams with Her's, and speaking more</L>
<L>Than ever charm'd, ecstatic Poet sigh'd</L>
<L>To listening Beauty, bright with conscious Smiles,</L>
<L>And graceful Vanity. But if on Bed</L>
<L>Delirious flung, Sleep from his Pillow flies.</L>
<L>All Night he tosses, nor the balmy Power</L>
<L>In any Posture finds; 'till the grey Morn</L>
<L>Lifts her pale Lustre on the paler Wretch,</L>
<L>Exanimate by Love: and then perhaps</L>
<L>Exhausted Nature sinks a-while to Rest,</L>
<L>Still interrupted by disorder'd Dreams,</L>
<L>That o'er the sick Imagination rise,</L>
<L>And in black Colours paint the mimic Scene.</L>
<L>Oft with the Charmer of his Soul he talks;</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="62"/>
Sometimes in Growds distrest; or if retir'd</L>
<L>To secret-winding,, Flower-inwoven Bowers,</L>
<L>Far from the dull Impertinence of Man,</L>
<L>Just as He kneeling all his former Cares</L>
<L>Begins to lose in vast oblivious Love,</L>
<L>Snatch'd from her yielded Hand, he knows not how,</L>
<L>Thro' Forests huge, and long untravel'd Heaths</L>
<L>With Desolation brown, he wanders waste,</L>
<L>In Night and Tempest wrapt; or shrinks aghast,</L>
<L>Back, from the bending Precipice; or wades</L>
<L>The turbid Stream below, and strives to reach</L>
<L>The farther Shore, where succourless, and sad,</L>
<L>His Dearer Life extends her beckoning Arms,</L>
<L>But strives in vain, born by th' outragious Flood</L>
<L>To Distance down, he rides the ridgy Wave,</L>
<L>Or whelm'd beneath the boiling Eddy sinks.</L>
<L>Then a weak, wailing, lamentable Cry</L>
<L>Is heard, and all in Tears he wakes, again</L>
<L>To tread the Circle of revolving Woe.</L>
<L>These are the charming Agonies of Love,</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="63"/>
Whose Misery delights. But thro' the Heart</L>
<L>Should Jealousy it's Venom once diffuse,</L>
<L>'Tis then delightful Misery no more,</L>
<L>But Agony unmixt, incessant Rage,</L>
<L>Corroding every Thought, and blasting all</L>
<L>The Paradise of Love. Ye Fairy Prospects then,</L>
<L>Ye Beds of Roses, and ye Bowers of Joy,</L>
<L>Farewell! Ye Gleamings of departing Peace,</L>
<L>Shine out your last! The yellow-tinging Plague</L>
<L>Internal Vision taints, and in a Night</L>
<L>Of livid Gloom Imagination wraps.</L>
<L>Ay then, instead of Love-enliven'd Cheeks,</L>
<L>Of Sunny Features, and of ardent Eyes</L>
<L>With flowing Rapture bright, dark Looks succeed,</L>
<L>Suffus'd, and glaring with untender Fire,</L>
<L>A clouded Aspect, and a burning Cheek,</L>
<L>Where the whole poison'd Soul, malignant, fits,</L>
<L>And frightens Love away. Ten thousand Fears,</L>
<L>Invented wild, ten thousand frantic Views</L>
<L>Of horrid Rivals, hanging on the Charms</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="64"/>
For which he melts in Fondness, eat him up</L>
<L>With fervent Anguish, and consuming Pine.</L>
<L>In vain Reproaches lend their idle Aid,</L>
<L>Deceitful Pride, and Resolution frail,</L>
<L>Giving a Moment's Ease. Reflection pours,</L>
<L>Afresh, her Beauties on his busy Thought,</L>
<L>Her first Endearments, twining round the Soul,</L>
<L>With all the Witchcraft of ensnaring Love.</L>
<L>Strait the fierce Storm involves his Mind anew,</L>
<L>Flames thro' the Nerves, and boils along the Veins;</L>
<L>While anxious Doubt distracts the tortur'd Heart;</L>
<L>For even the sad Assurance of his Fears</L>
<L>Were Heaven to what he feels. Thus the warm Youth,</L>
<L>Whom Love deludes into his thorny Wilds,</L>
<L>Thro' flowery-tempting Paths, or leads a Life</L>
<L>Of feavor'd Rapture, or of cruel Care;</L>
<L>His brightest Aims extinguish'd all, and all</L>
<L>His lively Moments running down to Waste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="55" REF="65"/>
<L>BUT happy They! the Happiest of their Kind!</L>
<L>Whom gentler Stars unite, and in one Fate</L>
<L>Their Hearts, their Fortunes, and their Beings blend.</L>
<L>'Tis not the courser Tie of human Laws,</L>
<L>Unnatural oft, and foreign to the Mind,</L>
<L>Which binds their Peace, but Harmony itself,</L>
<L>Attuning all their Passions into Love;</L>
<L>Where Friendship full-exerts his softest Power,</L>
<L>Perfect Esteem enliven'd by Desire</L>
<L>Ineffable, and Sympathy of Soul,</L>
<L>Thought meeting Thought, and Will preventing Will,</L>
<L>With boundless Confidence; for nought but Love</L>
<L>Can answer Love, and render Bliss secure.</L>
<L>Let Him, ungenerous, who, alone intent</L>
<L>To bless himself, from sordid Parents buys</L>
<L>The loathing Virgin, in eternal Care,</L>
<L>Well-merited, consume his Nights and Days.</L>
<L>Let barbarous Nations, whose inhuman Love</L>
<L>Is wild Desire fierce as the Suns they feel,</L>
<L>Let Eastern Tyrants from the Light of Heaven</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="66"/>
Seclude their Bosom-slaves, meanly possest</L>
<L>Of a meer, lifeless, violated Form:</L>
<L>While those whom Love cements, in holy Faith,</L>
<L>And equal Transport, free as Nature, live,</L>
<L>Disdaining Fear; for what's the World to them,</L>
<L>It's Pomp, it's Pleasure, and it's Nonsense all!</L>
<L>Who in each other clasp whatever fair</L>
<L>High Fancy forms, and lavish Hearts can wish,</L>
<L>Something than Beauty dearer, should they look</L>
<L>Or on the Mind, or Mind-illumin'd Face,</L>
<L>Truth, Goodness, Honour, Harmony and Love,</L>
<L>The richest Bounty of indulgent <HI>Heaven.</HI></L>
<L>Mean-time a smiling Offspring rises round,</L>
<L>And mingles both their Graces. By degrees,</L>
<L>The human Blossom blows; and every Day,</L>
<L>Soft as it rolls along, shows some new Charm,</L>
<L>The Father's Lustre, and the Mother's Bloom.</L>
<L>Then infant Reason grows apace, and calls</L>
<L>For the kind Hand of an assiduous Care:</L>
<L>Delightful Task! to rear the tender Thought,</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="67"/>
To teach the young Idea how to shoot,</L>
<L>To pour the fresh Instruction o'er the Mind,</L>
<L>To breathe th' inspiring Spirit, and to plant</L>
<L>The generous Purpose in the glowing Breast.</L>
<L>Oh speak the Joy! You, whom the sudden Tear</L>
<L>Surprizes often, while you look around,</L>
<L>And nothing strikes your Eye but Sights of Bliss,</L>
<L>All various Nature pressing on the Heart,</L>
<L>Obedient Fortune, and approving <HI>Heaven.</HI></L>
<L>These are the Blessings of diviner Love;</L>
<L>And thus their Moments fly; the <HI>Seasons</HI> thus,</L>
<L>As ceaseless round a jarring World they roll,</L>
<L>Still find Them happy; and consenting SPRING</L>
<L>Sheds her own rosy Garland on their Head:</L>
<L>Till Evening comes at last, cool, gentle, calm;</L>
<L>When after the long vernal Day of Life,</L>
<L>Enamour'd more, as Soul approaches Soul,</L>
<L>Together, down They sink in social Sleep.</L>
