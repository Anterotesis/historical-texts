<HEAD>THE Seditious Insects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NEAR the Cool Verge of that Delightful Strand,</L>
<L>Where winding <HI>Thames</HI> rowls over Golden Sand,</L>
<L>Where Western Breezes fan the Gentle Air,</L>
<L>And <HI>Britain</HI>'s brightest Ornaments appear,</L>
<L>An Ancient Hive of <HI>Aristaean</HI> Bees,</L>
<L>With pleasure swarm'd among the Fragrant Trees.</L>
<L>Long did their Labours o'er the Land diffuse</L>
<L>Aerial Honey, and Ambrosial Dews,</L>
<L>Collected from the Meads, and Rosie Bowers,</L>
<L>And Morning Sweets, that tip the gaudy Flowers</L>
<L>Of their gay Pride, despoiling every Plain,</L>
<L>To feed with Heavenly Juice the humble Swain,</L>
<L>And load with labour'd Sweets the flowing Land again.</L>
<L>Safe was their Hive from all oppressive Harms,</L>
<L>No Dreams of Danger discompos'd their Swarms;</L>
<L>But fam'd for Peace and Order they were known,</L>
<L>True Bees due Homage to Superiours own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This was their State, when busie Moths arose,</L>
<L>And Wasps Insidious, equally their Foes.</L>
<L>Hornets and Drones, and all the humming Tribe</L>
<L>Whom Hate cou'd Summon, or whom Int'rest Bribe.</L>
<L>Gnats, Beetles, Locusts, all the Worthless kind</L>
<L>Of hateful Insects in the Riot join'd,</L>
<L>Buzzing false Dangers, and distracting Fears,</L>
<L>In new Confusions now the Hive appears;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Customs unknown to Ages heretofore</L>
<L>Corrupt the Breed, the Virgin Race deflow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when False Teachers in the Church arise,</L>
<L>Schism prevails, and true Religion dies;</L>
<L>Faith takes her flight, unable to sustain</L>
<L>The Mighty Shock, Reason perswades in vain;</L>
<L>Till Heavenly Energy our Breast inspires</L>
<L>With Sacred Sense of true Etherial Fires,</L>
<L>Then the dark Clouds of Errour fly apace,</L>
<L>And Revelation reassumes her Place.</L>
<L>Now the warm Foe their <HI>Io Paeans</HI> sing,</L>
<L>In every Vale loud Peals of Conquest ring;</L>
<L>The painted Butterfly with empty Sound,</L>
<L>Proclaim'd the gaudy Triumph all around;</L>
<L>Every vile Insect to the Hive repairs,</L>
<L>Foments the Tumult, and the Plunder Shares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sated with Spoil, with Victory elate,</L>
<L>The Hostile Vermine whet their pointed Hate:</L>
<L>Each Envious Thought they sooth, and proudly drive</L>
<L>The Bees dejected from the Luscious Hive;</L>
<L>When their Just King touch'd with a Princely Zeal,</L>
<L>To save his Subjects, and their Pressures heal,</L>
<L>Gives up the Councellors who ill-advis'd,</L>
<L>And their Immoderate Enterprize chastis'd,</L>
<L>Another Set of Ministers he chose,</L>
<L>And freed the Hive from their Vexatious Foes.</L>
<L>With Rays of Heavenly Light returning Peace</L>
<L>Smil'd on the Great Design, and Crown'd it with Success;</L>
<L>Such is the Power of Majesty Divine,</L>
<L>When in full Lustre it vouchsafes to shine.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
The Rebel Brood struck with amazing Dread,</L>
<L>In trembling Horror and Confusion fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So have the Zealots of our Church appear'd,</L>
<L>(If Little Things may be with Great Compar'd,)</L>
<L>Busie with specious Dangers to amuse,</L>
<L>With Patriots Fears the Populace abuse,</L>
<L>When 'twas the Churches Honey rais'd the Cry,</L>
<L>Join'd with the Sweetness of the Ministry.</L>
<L>Had they still loll'd in Soft Luxurious Ease,</L>
<L>The Church had flourish'd in Triumphant Peace,</L>
<L>The <HI>Synods</HI> too been Safe, secure from Harm,</L>
<L>(Tho' even in them some Holy Vermin swarm:)</L>
<L>O say, Bright Goddess, whence this Temper flows,</L>
<L>And show how first the Fatal Schism rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long has the Papal Power aspir'd to reign</L>
<L>With Universal sway: Why will they strive in vain?</L>
<L>Some Angel still by a Divine Command</L>
<L>Will interpose to save the British Land.</L>
<L>Successive Plots, and Jesuitick Wiles,</L>
<L>Open Attempts, and seeming Friendly Smiles,</L>
<L>Have in their Turns, with the same vile Intent,</L>
<L>Contriv'd the Ruin of this Government.</L>
<L>This to promote, some Fathers heretofore</L>
<L>Lavish of Labour, prodigal of Gore,</L>
<L>Fain wou'd their Hands in Royal Blood imbrue,</L>
<L>And bless'd the Deed as Meritorious too,</L>
<L>Since the Libation to the Church was due.</L>
<L>This Sainted Herd, this Vile, Deceiving Race,</L>
<L>Now in Rich <HI>Fresco</HI> at <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Remarks on Italy,</NOTE> <HI>Loretto</HI> blaze;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Where Speaking Marble do's their Story tell,</L>
<L>This for the Faith, that for Religion fell;</L>
<L>When for the worst of Crimes the Hellish Breed,</L>
<L>Did by the Justest Law of Nations Bleed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such Saints as These <HI>England</HI> too much has known,</L>
<L>Who <HI>Clemens</HI> and <HI>Ravilliac</HI>'s Maxims own;</L>
<L>King-killing Doctrines, and Deposing Crowns,</L>
<L>Too oft have been the Theme of Servile Gowns.</L>
<L><HI>Peters</HI> and <HI>Ferguson</HI> may surely claim</L>
<L>A Share with <HI>Garnet</HI> in Immortal Fame.</L>
<L><HI>Lacy</HI> and <HI>Marion</HI> too in time may vie</L>
<L>With either kind for Gifts and Prophecy;</L>
<L>The same Seditious Spirit forms their Will</L>
<L>For Mischief, Arm'd alike with Blind Ungovern'd Zeal.</L>
<L>Whole Ages have such Emissaries try'd,</L>
<L>This much too fickle Nation to divide</L>
<L>With open Violence. In Eighty-eight</L>
<L>They lead their easie King, and rid the yielding State.</L>
<L>Law fell before their Arbitrary Sway,</L>
<L>And now they Smil'd, and Bless'd the Happy Day,</L>
<L>When <HI>British</HI> Liberty no more shou'd stand</L>
<L>In opposition to Supream Command.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus were we crush'd by the Intrigues of <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Till Glorious <HI>Nassau</HI> had revers'd our Doom;</L>
<L>He came to save us with extended Arms,</L>
<L>Restore our Laws, and break the Tyrants Charms,</L>
<L>Rescue the Church from her insulting Foes,</L>
<L>And leave the Nation in a Blest Repose;</L>
<L>This done, he fled to his Congenial Sphere,</L>
<L>And shines upon the Land a Bright Auspicious Star.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Forgive, Immortal <HI>Hero,</HI> if my Muse,</L>
<L>Conscious of Weakness, her own Theme pursues,</L>
<L>Nor aims to Praise so Excellent a King,</L>
<L>None but a <HI>Virgil</HI> shou'd a <HI>Caesar</HI> Sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Mortal Pangs they saw the <HI>Romish</HI> Yoke</L>
<L>Thus by our Happy Revolution broke</L>
<L>By open force; despairing to succeed,</L>
<L>On New Designs their Factious Agents lead</L>
<L>Various Intrigues, their Cursed Engines try,</L>
<L>No Difficulties daunt their Industry,</L>
<L>But what the Sword denies they attempt by Prophecy.</L>
<L>Earth, Hell, and Seas, they'll compass to deceive,</L>
<L>And Glory in the Toil if <HI>Proselites</HI> believe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when Imperial <HI>Juno</HI> had implor'd</L>
<L>The Thunderer's Aid to crush the <HI>Trojan</HI> Lord,</L>
<L>The Awful God denying her Request,</L>
<L>Told her, <HI>Aeneas</HI> must in <HI>Latium</HI> rest;</L>
<L>But she Impatient, by strong Passion mov'd,</L>
<L>(So much a Female Jesuit she prov'd)</L>
<L>Besought the Powers beneath to be her Friends,</L>
<L>And went to Hell to gain her Pious Ends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sure 'twas from thence this Gifted Spirit came,</L>
<L>No Heavenly Fire, but an Infernal Flame,</L>
<L>Design'd by <HI>Jesuits</HI> to destroy Our Ease,</L>
<L>And pall the Joys of our United Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For this, Seditious Spirits in disguise</L>
<L>Swarm in the Church, tho' they that Church despise:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Loudly they boast her Ancient Rights and Fame,</L>
<L>Whilst underhand they play a Popish Game.</L>
<L>The Seed of <HI>Loyold</HI> with Artful Pains</L>
<L>First fixt this High-Church Poyson in our Veins,</L>
<L>Infecting too too many of our Youth,</L>
<L>Who, blindly led, fell from the Cause of Truth.</L>
<L><HI>Isis</HI> no more can boast of healing Streams,</L>
<L>The Deity has long withdrawn his Beams;</L>
<L>Displeas'd that they polluted his Abode,</L>
<L>That High-Church Victims now his Altars load,</L>
<L>And Priests no Incense offer worthy of a God.</L>
<L>Hence we derive the Cause of all our Woes,</L>
<L>From hence the Dangers of the Church arose;</L>
<L>Hence empty <HI>Libertines</HI> with Modish Air,</L>
<L>At Myst'ry laugh, and all Religion jeer;</L>
<L>When Fountains are corrupt, how can the Streams be clear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when at <HI>Athens</HI> the Degenerate Race</L>
<L>Left their old Morals, new Ones to Embrace,</L>
<L>The Guardian Deities their Shrines forsook,</L>
<L>In vain the Victims on their Altars smoak;</L>
<L>In vain the Fragrant Gums in Spheres ascend,</L>
<L>Th'unhallow'd Incense did but more offend:</L>
<L>Then Highflown Priests their new Distinctions brought,</L>
<L>And Faction for Religion first was taught;</L>
<L>Then Piety and Ancient Faith decay'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Synod-</HI>Men the Churches Right betray'd;</L>
<L>Then Vice and Vertue were in Schools defin'd,</L>
<L>As the Declaiming Stagyrite inclin'd;</L>
<L>But Truth abandon'd did in Secret Mourn,</L>
<L>And begg'd the Blooming Goddess to return.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
O say, Celestial Muse, the Reason tell,</L>
<L>Why in those Heavenly Men such Passions dwell?</L>
<L>Why those who preach Religion, Zeal profess,</L>
<L>And for the Church such Flaming Love confess,</L>
<L>Shall in vile Terms of their Superiors speak,</L>
<L>Slight their Authority, their Orders break;</L>
<L>In open Disobedience live, and rail,</L>
<L>And hope by Innovations to prevail,</L>
<L>With Intermediate Sessions, why confound</L>
<L>The Churches Peace, the Convocation wound?</L>
<L>By Rights Usurp'd why Presbyters prepare</L>
<L>Their Primate's Power without Consent to share,</L>
<L>And fill without his leave the Prolocutor's Chair?</L>
<L>Why to their Members they pretend to give</L>
<L>Commissions to absent? Why grant 'em leave,</L>
<L>And by what Right, with what assuming Face,</L>
<L>They substitute their Proxies in their Place?</L>
<L>Why Actuaries they chose? But with intent</L>
<L>T'infringe the Power of their President,</L>
<L>Whose most Undoubted Right 'thas always been</L>
<L>As well for to Prorogue as to Convene.</L>
<L>T'appoint his Register, of Deputation,</L>
<L>To act in either House or Convocation.</L>
<L>And why such grateful Thoughts these Men retain,</L>
<L>Of the Transcendent Mildness of this Reign,</L>
<L>So warmly to oppose the Lords Address, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Bishops Address of Thanks refused by the Lower-House.</NOTE></L>
<L>Where in the Humblest Terms they did express</L>
<L>Their Thanks to Heaven for that Illustrious Queen,</L>
<L>In whom such Wondrous Piety is seen;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Whose unexampled Bounty has declar'd</L>
<L>How much the Churches Welfare she rever'd;</L>
<L>Such true diffusive Charity reveals</L>
<L>What Sense of Goodness in her Soul she feels.</L>
<L>A Charity which in its Nature shews</L>
<L>Heaven for its Birth-place, where it first arose,</L>
<L>From whence descending to her Royal Breast,</L>
<L>The Radiant Virtue Kind'red Flames Confest,</L>
<L>And own'd the Bright Abode, worthy the Godlike Guest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For me, the first Desire which does Controul</L>
<L>The Secret Springs which move my rising Soul</L>
<L>Is, that her Glorious Reign I might rehearse</L>
<L>In equal Numbers, and distinguish'd Verse.</L>
<L>But far, O far above the Poet's Flame</L>
<L>Is her Bright Story, and Immortal Name.</L>
<L>Cou'd I, like <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>x,</HI> in lasting Strains</L>
<L>Transcend the <HI>Mantuan</HI> or <HI>Moeonian</HI> Swains,</L>
<L>Then shou'd her more than Mortal Vertue shine,</L>
<L>And Heavenly Eloquence adorn each Line;</L>
<L>Then shou'd my Happy Muse record her Fame,</L>
<L>And <HI>ANNA</HI>'s Glory be my endless Theme;</L>
<L>But whether does the Ravish'd Muse Aspire?</L>
<L>Not <HI>Phoebus</HI> boasts a more exalted Fire,</L>
<L>Or touches with more Art the sweetly sounding Lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain our Monarch labours to engage,</L>
<L>With all her Clemency, these Men of Rage,</L>
<L>Who their Defect of Duty wou'd supply,</L>
<L>By wrangling for their Independency.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Who without Precedent insist to use</L>
<L>Forms of their own, and their own Methods chuse;</L>
<L>Tho' former Synods always in like Case</L>
<L>Comply'd with the Directions of his Grace,</L>

<L>T'acknowledge Duty, or Dependance own:</L>
<L>These claim a Right Co-ordinate with theirs,</L>
<L>And Model as they please the Church Affairs.</L>
<L>So <HI>Puritans</HI> of Old in the same Strain,</L>

<L>Thro' our Blest <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Sides the <HI>Temple</HI> wound,</L>
<L>And on pretence of Rights her Sacred Peace confound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By such as these the Church in every Age</L>
<L>Has felt the sad Effects of Party Rage;</L>
<L>But Heaven which always smil'd on her Bright Fame,</L>
<L>And look'd with Pity on the suff'ring Dame,</L>
<L>Has rais'd up Hero's to assert her Cause,</L>
<L>And rouze the Terror of Vindictive Laws,</L>
<L>T'avenge her Injur'd Honour upon those</L>
<L>Who dare Insinuate her lost Repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Begin Coelestial Muse the pleasing Strain,</L>
<L>Record the Hero's of Great <HI>ANNA</HI>'s Reign,</L>
<L>By whose Unerring Councils she endears</L>
<L>Her Peoples Love, and <HI>Europe</HI>'s Fate declares.</L>
<L>Harmonious <HI>Co<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r</HI> sing in Lays Divine,</L>
<L>By whose Bright Virtue <HI>Courts</HI> of Justice shine;</L>
<L>Such are the Charms of his Immortal Sence,</L>
<L><HI>Union</HI> succeeds, and Happy Days Commence,</L>
<L>And <HI>Equity</HI> receives from him its Influence.</L>
<L>But Oh! What Numbers shall the Sprightly Muse,</L>
<L>Equal to Great <HI>God<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n</HI>'s Wisdom chuse?</L>
<L>What Happy Strains his <HI>Management</HI> disclose,</L>
<L>Ador'd by Friends, and even rever'd by Foes?</L>
<L>Too weak alas is her aspiring Flame</L>
<L>To praise such Worth, such Merit to proclaim,</L>
<L>Such Scenes of Glory open to her view,</L>
<L>She's lost in Thought, yet urges to pursue.</L>
<L>O Charming <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n,</HI> the Theme is thine,</L>
<L>The Subject as the Poet is Divine.</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
Thy Strength of Reason, sweetly flowing Verse,</L>
<L>Alone are fit Great <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r</HI> to rehearse;</L>
<L>To paint the Graces of that Godlike Mind,</L>
<L>Where Judgment is with strictest Honour join'd,</L>
<L>And every Thought to <HI>Britain</HI>'s Peace consign'd.</L>
<L>Your Sense Sublime it is, which must relate</L>
<L>How <HI>So<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>rs, Ha<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>x</HI> Divinely Great</L>
<L>Appear, like Guardian Angels of the <HI>British</HI> State.</L>
<L>How they in every Art and Council join,</L>
<L>How wake for our Support, for our Defence combine.</L>
<L>A Muse like yours Superiour to the Nine,</L>
<L>Alone is equal to the vast Design.</L>
<L>A Radiant List of <HI>Worthies</HI> I behold,</L>
<L>Whose Powerful Hands the Fate of <HI>Albion</HI> hold,</L>
<L>Whose <HI>Resolutions</HI> terminate in Law,</L>
<L>Peace to Preserve, and Rebels keep in Awe.</L>
<L>Among the Brightest of this Godlike Race,</L>
<L>A Heavenly Prelate stor'd with every Grace</L>
<L>Appears, Coelestial Peace and Love</L>
<L>Thro' every Scene of his Bright Actions move;</L>
<L>In him true Piety and Zeal we find,</L>
<L>A Nervous Judgment and Sweet Temper join'd,</L>
<L>The Ornament and Joy of Church and State,</L>
<L>The <HI>Jesuits</HI> Terrour, and the Tories Hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Best of Kings by Light from Heaven inspir'd,</L>
<L>And with just Ardour of his Vertue fir'd,</L>
<L>This Best of Bishops to the Temple gave,</L>
<L>To vanquish Errour, true Religion save,</L>
<L>To fix her Throne secure on lasting Peace,</L>
<L>Till Time shall fail, and rowling Ages cease;</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
That no Attempts from Factious Priests or <HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>Might interrupt her Happiness to come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For this his Enemies revile his Fame,</L>
<L>And load with Slander his Immortal Name;</L>
<L>But he at Peace within sedately bears</L>
<L>Their Hate, and unconcern'd their Malice hears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No gath'ring Clouds of Thunder yet appear,</L>
<L>Nor more amazing <HI>Premunire</HI>'s scare;</L>
<L>No Censures interrupt the soft Repose</L>
<L>Of his Rebellious and Insulting Foes;</L>
<L>Like the Good Queen he all Forgiveness seems,</L>
<L>And the foul Rancour of their Spight contemns.</L>
<L>So when his Glorious Master was abus'd</L>
<L>By railing <HI>Jews,</HI> by their High-Church traduc'd,</L>
<L>Mildly he did their Insolence reprove,</L>
<L>For Murd'rous Hate he show'r'd down Heavenly Love,</L>
<L>And Healing Moderation from above.</L>
