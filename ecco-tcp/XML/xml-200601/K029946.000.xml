<L>O MORTAL Man, who livest here by Toil,</L>
<L>Do not complain of this thy hard Estate;</L>
<L>That like an Emmet thou must ever moil,</L>
<L>Is a sad Sentence of an ancient Date:</L>
<L>And, certes, there is for it Reason great;</L>
<L>For, though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail,</L>
<L>And curse thy Star, and early drudge and late,</L>
<L>Withouten That would come an heavier Bale,</L>

<L>In lowly Dale, fast by a River's Side,</L>
<L>With woody Hill o'er Hill encompass'd round,</L>
<L>A most enchanting Wizard did abide,</L>
<L>Than whom a Fiend more fell is no where found.</L>
<L>It was, I ween, a lovely Spot of Ground;</L>
<L>And there a Season atween June and May,</L>
<L>Half prankt with Spring, with Summer half imbrown'd,</L>
<L>A listless Climate made, where, Sooth to say,</L>
<L>No living Wight could work, ne cared even for Play.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Was nought around but Images of Rest:</L>
<L>Sleep-soothing Groves, and quiet Lawns between;</L>
<L>And flowery Beds that slumbrous Influence kest,</L>
<L>From Poppies breath'd; and Beds of pleasant Green,</L>
<L>Where never yet was creeping Creature seen.</L>
<L>Mean time unnumber'd glittering Streamlets play'd,</L>
<L>And hurled every-where their Waters sheen;</L>
<L>That, as they bicker'd through the sunny Glade,</L>
<L>Though restless still themselves, a lulling Murmur made.</L>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Join'd to the Prattle of the purling Rills,</L>
<L>Were heard the lowing Herds along the Vale,</L>
<L>And Flocks loud-bleating from the distant Hills,</L>
<L>And vacant Shepherds piping in the Dale;</L>
<L>And now and then sweet Philomel would wail,</L>
<L>Or Stock-Doves plain amid the Forest deep,</L>
<L>That drowsy rustled to the sighing Gale;</L>
<L>And still a Coil the Grashopper did keep:</L>
<L>Yet all these Sounds yblent inclined all to Sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>Full in the Passage of the Vale, above,</L>
<L>A sable, silent, solemn Forest stood;</L>
<L>Where nought but shadowy Forms were seen to move,</L>
<L>As <HI>Idless</HI> fancy'd in her dreaming Mood.</L>
<L>And up the Hills, on either Side, a Wood</L>
<L>Of blackening Pines, ay waving to and fro,</L>
<L>Sent forth a sleepy Horror through the Blood;</L>
<L>And where this Valley winded out, below,</L>
<L>The murmuring Main was heard, and scarcely heard, to flow.</L>

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>A pleasing Land of Drowsy-hed it was:</L>
<L>Of Dreams that wave before the half-shut Eye;</L>
<L>And of gay Castles in the Clouds that pass,</L>
<L>For ever flushing round a Summer-Sky:</L>
<L>There eke the soft Delights, that witchingly</L>
<L>Instil a wanton Sweetness through the Breast,</L>
<L>And the calm Pleasures always hover'd nigh;</L>
<L>But whate'er smack'd of Noyance, or Unrest,</L>
<L>Was far far off expell'd from this delicious Nest.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>The Landskip such, inspiring perfect Ease,</L>
<L>Where INDOLENCE (for so the Wizard hight)</L>
<L>Close-hid his Castle mid embowering Trees,</L>
<L>That half shut out the Beams of Phoebus bright,</L>
<L>And made a Kind of checker'd Day and Night.</L>
<L>Mean while, unceasing at the massy Gate,</L>
<L>Beneath a spacious Palm, the wicked Wight</L>
<L>Was plac'd; and to his Lute, of cruel Fate,</L>
<L>And Labour harsh, complain'd, lamenting Man's Estate.</L>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Thither continual Pilgrims crouded still,</L>
<L>From all the Roads of Earth that pass there by:</L>
<L>For, as they chaunc'd to breathe on neighbouring Hill,</L>
<L>The Freshness of this Valley smote their Eye,</L>
<L>And drew them ever and anon more nigh,</L>
<L>'Till clustering round th'Enchanter false they hung,</L>
<L>Ymolten with his Syren Melody;</L>
<L>While o'er th' enfeebling Lute his Hand he flung,</L>
<L>And to the trembling Chords these tempting Verses sung:</L>

<L>" What youthful Bride can equal her Array?</L>
<L>" Who can with Her for easy Pleasure vie?</L>
<L>" From Mead to Mead with gentle Wing to stray,</L>

<L>" Hymn their Good GOD, and carol sweet of Love,</L>
<L>" Such grateful kindly Raptures them emove:</L>
<L>" They neither plough, nor sow; ne, fit for Flail,</L>
<L>" E'er to the Barn the nodding Sheaves they drove;</L>

<L>" Of Cares that eat away thy Heart with Gall,</L>
<L>" And of the Vices, an inhuman Train,</L>
<L>" That all proceed from savage Thirst of Gain:</L>
<L>" For when hard-hearted <HI>Interest</HI> first began</L>
<L>" To poison Earth, <HI>Astraea</HI> left the Plain;</L>

<L>" And, for soft milky Streams, with Blood the Rivers ran.</L>

<L>" Come, ye, who still the cumbrous Load of Life</L>
<L>" Push hard up Hill; but as the farthest Steep</L>
<L>" You trust to gain, and put an End to Strife,</L>
<L>" Down thunders back the Stone with mighty Sweep,</L>
<L>" And hurls your Labours to the Valley deep,</L>
<L>" For-ever vain: come, and, withouten Fee,</L>
<L>" I in Oblivion will your Sorrows steep,</L>
<L>" Your Cares, your Toils, will steep you in a Sea</L>
<L>" Of full Delight: O come, ye weary Wights, to me!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>" With me, you need not rise at early Dawn,</L>
<L>" To pass the joyless Day in various Stounds:</L>
<L>" Or, louting low, on upstart Fortune fawn,</L>
<L>" And sell fair Honour for some paltry Pounds;</L>
<L>" Or through the City take your dirty Rounds,</L>
<L>" To cheat, and dun, and lye, and Visit pay,</L>
<L>" Now flattering base, now giving secret Wounds;</L>
<L>" Or proul in Courts of Law for human Prey,</L>
<L>" In venal Senate thieve, or rob on broad High-way.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>" No Cocks, with me, to rustic Labour call,</L>
<L>" From Village on to Village sounding clear;</L>
<L>" To tardy Swain no shrill-voic'd Matrons squall;</L>
<L>" No Dogs, no Babes, no Wives, to stun your Ear;</L>
<L>" No Hammers thump; no horrid Blacksmith sear,</L>
<L>" Ne noisy Tradesman your sweet Slumbers start,</L>
<L>" With Sounds that are a Misery to hear:</L>
<L>" But all is calm, as would delight the Heart</L>
<L>" Of <HI>Sybarite</HI> of old, all Nature, and all Art.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>" Here nought but Candour reigns, indulgent Ease,</L>
<L>" Good-natur'd Lounging, Sauntering up and down:</L>
<L>" They who are pleas'd themselves must always please;</L>
<L>" On Others' Ways they never squint a Frown,</L>
<L>" Nor heed what haps in Hamlet or in Town.</L>
<L>" Thus, from the Source of tender Indolence,</L>
<L>" With milky Blood the Heart is overflown,</L>
<L>" Is sooth'd and sweeten'd by the social Sense;</L>
<L>" For Interest, Envy, Pride, and Strife are banish'd hence.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>" What, what, is Virtue, but Repose of Mind?</L>
<L>" A pure ethereal Calm! that knows no Storm;</L>
<L>" Above the Reach of wild Ambition's Wind,</L>
<L>" Above those Passions that this World deform,</L>
<L>" And torture Man, a proud malignant Worm!</L>
<L>" But here, instead, soft Gales of Passion play,</L>
<L>" And gently stir the Heart, thereby to form</L>
<L>" A quicker Sense of Joy; as Breezes stray</L>
<L>" Across th' enliven'd Skies, and make them still more gay.</L>

<L>" Where the Soul sowrs, and gradual Rancour grows,</L>
<L>" Imbitter'd more from peevish Day to Day.</L>
<L>" Even Those whom Fame has lent her fairest Ray,</L>
<L>" The most renown'd of worthy Wights of Yore,</L>
<L>" From a base World at last have stolen away:</L>

<L>" Amid the Groves you may indulge the Muse,</L>
<L>" Or tend the Blooms, and deck the vernal Year;</L>
<L>" Or softly stealing, with your watry Gear,</L>
<L>" Along the Brooks, the crimson-spotted Fry</L>
<L>" You may delude: The whilst, amus'd, you hear</L>

<L>" When, sudden, comes blind unrelenting Fate,</L>

<L>" With ruthless Toil, and many a Wretch undone,</L>
<L>" To Those who mock you gone to <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Reign,</L>

<L>He ceas'd. But still their trembling Ears retain'd</L>
<L>The deep Vibrations of his witching Song;</L>
<L>That, by a Kind of Magic Power, constrain'd</L>
<L>To enter in, pell-mell, the listening Throng.</L>
<L>Heaps pour'd on Heaps, and yet they slip'd along</L>
<L>In silent Ease: as when beneath the Beam</L>
<L>Of Summer-Moons, the distant Woods among,</L>
<L>Or by some Flood all silver'd with the Gleam,</L>
<L>The soft-embodied Fays through airy Portal stream.</L>

<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>By the smooth Demon so it order'd was,</L>
<L>And here his baneful Bounty first began:</L>
<L>Though some there were who would not further pass,</L>
<L>And his alluring Baits suspected han.</L>
<L>The Wise distrust the too fair-spoken Man.</L>
<L>Yet through the Gate they cast a wishful Eye:</L>
<L>Not to move on, perdie, is all they can;</L>
<L>For do their very Best they cannot fly,</L>
<L>But often each Way look, and often sorely sigh.</L>

<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>When this the watchful wicked Wizard saw,</L>
<L>With sudden Spring he leap'd upon them strait;</L>
<L>And soon as touch'd by his unhallow'd Paw,</L>
<L>They found themselves within the cursed Gate;</L>
<L>Full hard to be repass'd, like That of Fate.</L>
<L>Not stronger were of old the Giant-Crew,</L>
<L>Who sought to pull high <HI>Jove</HI> from regal State;</L>
<L>Though feeble Wretch he seem'd, of sallow Hue:</L>
<L>Certes, who bides his Grasp, will that Encounter rue.</L>

<L>For whomsoe'er the Villain takes in Hand,</L>
<L>Their Joints unknit, their Sinews melt apace;</L>
<L>As lithe they grow as any Willow-Wand,</L>
<L>And of their vanish'd Force remains no Trace:</L>
<L>So when a Maiden fair, of modest Grace,</L>
<L>In all her buxom blooming May of Charms,</L>
<L>Is seized in some Losel's hot Embrace,</L>
<L>She waxeth very weakly as she warms,</L>
<L>Then sighing yields Her up to Love's delicious Harms.</L>

<L>Wak'd by the Croud, slow from his Bench arose</L>
<L>A comely full-spred Porter, swoln with Sleep:</L>
<L>His calm, broad, thoughtless Aspect breath'd Repose;</L>
<L>And in sweet Torpor he was plunged deep,</L>
<L>Ne could himself from ceaseless Yawning keep;</L>
<L>While o'er his Eyes the drowsy Liquor ran,</L>
<L>Through which his half-wak'd Soul would faintly peep.</L>
<L>Then taking his black Staff he call'd his Man,</L>
<L>And rous'd himself as much as rouse himself he can.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>The Lad leap'd lightly at his Master's Call.</L>
<L>He was, to weet, a little roguish Page,</L>
<L>Save Sleep and Play who minded nought at all,</L>
<L>Like most the untaught Striplings of his Age.</L>
<L>This Boy he kept each Band to disengage,</L>
<L>Garters and Buckles, Task for him unfit,</L>
<L>But ill-becoming his grave Personage,</L>
<L>And which his portly Paunch would not permit,</L>
<L>So this same limber Page to All performed It.</L>

<L>Mean time the Master-Porter wide display'd</L>
<L>Great Store of Caps, of Slippers, and of Gowns;</L>
<L>Wherewith he Those who enter'd in, array'd;</L>
<L>Loose, as the Breeze that plays along the Downs,</L>
<L>And waves the Summer-Woods when Evening frowns.</L>
<L>O fair Undress, best Dress! it checks no Vein,</L>
<L>But every flowing Limb in Pleasure drowns,</L>
<L>And heightens Ease with Grace. This done, right fain,</L>
<L>Sir Porter sat him down, and turn'd to Sleep again.</L>

<L>Thus easy-rob'd, they to the Fountain sped,</L>
<L>That in the Middle of the Court up-threw</L>
<L>A Stream, high-spouting from its liquid Bed,</L>
<L>And falling back again in drizzly Dew:</L>
<L>There Each deep Draughts, as deep he thirsted, drew.</L>
<L>It was a Fountain of <HI>Nepenthe</HI> rare:</L>
<L>Whence, as Dan HOMER sings, huge Pleasaunce grew,</L>
<L>And sweet Oblivion of vile earthly Care;</L>
<L>Fair gladsome waking Thoughts, and joyous Dreams more fair.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Poem being writ in the Manner of <HI>Spenser,</HI> the obsolete Words, and a Simplicity of Diction in some of the Lines, which borders on the Ludicrous, were necessary to make the Imitation more perfect. And the Stile of that admirable Poet, as well as the Measure in which he wrote, are as it were ap∣propriated by Custom to all Allegorical Poems writ in our Lan∣guage; just as in French the Stile of <HI>Marot</HI> who lived under <HI>Francis I.</HI> has been used in Tales, and familiar Epistles, by the politest Writers of the Age of <HI>Louis XIV.</HI></P>
