<P>CHARLES, here are more stories for you,—stories about good boys, and
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
naughty boys, and silly boys; for you know what it is to be good now. And there is a story about two foolish Cocks that were always quarrelling, which is very naughty. You do not quarrel? No. I am glad of it; but if you see any little boys that quarrel you may tell
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
them the story of the Two Cocks. This is it:</P>
<P>There was once a Hen who lived in a farm-yard, and she had a large brood of chickens. She took a great deal of care of them, and gathered them under her wings every night, and fed them, and nursed them
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
very well: and they were all very good, except two Cocks, that were always quarrelling with one another. They were hardly out of the shell before they began to peck at each other; and when they grew bigger they fought till they were all bloody. If one picked
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
up a barley-corn the other always wanted to have it. They never looked pretty, be∣cause their feathers were pulled off in fighting till they were quite bare; and they picked at one another's eyes till they were both almost blind. The old Hen very often told them
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
how naughty it was to quarrel so; but they did not mind her.</P>
<P>So one day these two Cocks had been fighting, as they al∣ways did; and the biggest Cock, whose name was Chan∣ticleer, beat the other, and crowed over him, and drove
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
him quite out of the yard. The Cock that had been beat slunk away and hid himself; for he was vexed he had been conquered, and he wanted sadly to be revenged; but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>id not know how to manage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for he was not strong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ough himself. So, after
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
thinking a great deal, he went to an old sly Fox that lived near, and said to him, Fox, if you will come with me I will shew you where there is a large fat Cock in a farm-yard, and you may cat him up if you will. The Fox was very glad, for he was
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
hungry enough; and he said, Yes, I will come with all my heart, and I will not leave a feather of him. So they went together, and the Cock shewed Reynard the way into the farm-yard; and there was poor Chanticleer asleep upon the perch. And
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
the Fox seized him by the neck, and ate him up; and the other Cock stood by and crowed for joy. But when the Fox had done, he said, Chanticleer was very good, but I have not had enough; and so he flew upon the other
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Cock, and ate him up too in a moment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>I will tell you a story.</P>
<P>There was a little boy whose name was Harry; and his papa and mamma sent
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
him to school. Now Harry was a clever fellow, and loved his book; and he got to be first in his class. So his mamma got up one morning very early and called Betty the maid, and said, Betty, I think we must make a cake for Harry, for he
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
has learned his book very well. And Betty said, Yes, with all my heart. So they made a nice cake. It was very large, and stuffed full of plums and sweetmeats, orange and citron; and it was iced all over with sugar: it was white and smooth on
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
the top like snow. So this cake was sent to the school. When little Harry saw it he was very glad, and jump∣ed about for joy, and he hardly stayed for a knife to cut a piece, but gnawed it like a little dog. So he ate till the bell rang for school, and
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
after school he ate again, and ate till he went to bed; nay, his bed-fellow told me that he laid his cake under his pillow, and sat up in the night to eat some. So he ate till it was all gone.—But presently after this little boy was very sick and ill,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
and every body said, I won∣der what is the matter with Harry—he used to be so brisk, and play about more nimbly than any of the boys; and now he looks pale and is very ill. And somebody said, Harry has had a rich cake, and eat it all up very
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
soon, and that has made him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. So they sent for Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>amomile, and he gave him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do not know how much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tter stuff. Poor Harry did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like it at all, but he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rced to take it, or else he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ould have died, you know. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at last he got well again,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
but his mamma said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would send him no mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> cakes.</P>
<P>Now there was anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> boy, who was one of Harry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> school-fellows: his name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Peter; the boys used <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> call him Peter Careful. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Peter had written his mam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very neat pretty letter—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ere was not one blot in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all. So his mamma sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a cake. Now Peter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ought with himself, I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ot make myself sick with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>is good cake, as silly Harry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>id; I will keep it a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hile. So he took the cake,
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
and tugged it up stairs. I was very heavy: he cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> hardly carry it. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> locked it up in his box, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> once a day he crept slily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stairs, and ate a very litt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> piece, and then locked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> box again. So he kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> several weeks, and it was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>one, for it was very large; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ut, behold! the mice got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nto his box and nibbled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ome. And the cake grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ry and mouldy, and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ast was good for nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all. So he was obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> throw it away, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rieved him to the very heart,
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
and no body was sorry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him.</P>
<P>Well; there was anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> little boy at the same schoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> whose name was Billy. And one day his mamma sent him a cake, because she love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> him dearly, and he loved he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> dearly. So when the cak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
ame, Billy said to his school∣fellows I have got a cake, come let us go and eat it. So they came about him like a parcel of bees; and Billy took a slice of cake himself, and then gave a piece to one, and a piece to another, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> piece to another, till it was
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
almost gone. Then Billy put the rest by, and said, I will eat it to-morrow. So he went to play, and the boys all played together very mer∣rily. But presently after an old blind Fiddler came into the court: he had a long white beard; and, because he
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
was blind, he had a little dog in a string to lead him. So he came into the court, and sat down upon a stone, and said, My pretty lads, if you will, I will play you a tune. And they all left off their sport, and came and stood round him. And
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
Billy saw that while he play∣ed the tears ran down his cheeks. And Billy said, Old man, why do you cry? And the old man said, Because I am very hungry—I have no∣body to give me any din∣ners or suppers—I have no∣thing in the world but this
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
little dog; and I cannot work. If I could work I would. Then Billy went without saying a word, and fetched the rest of his cake which he had intended to have eaten another day, and he said, Here, old man! here is some cake for you. The
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
old man said, Where is it? for I am blind, I cannot see it. So Billy put it into his hat. And the Fiddler thank∣ed him, and Billy was more glad than if he had eaten ten cakes.</P>
<P>Pray which do you love
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
best? do you love Harry, or Peter, or Billy best?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>Little boy, come to me. Tell me how far from home have you been in your life? I think I should like to go a great long way with you,
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
and see what we could see: for there are a great many places in the world besides home. Bring your hat. Good-bye, Papa. Farewell, Billy, and Harry, and every body. We are going a great way off. And we shall go down the lane, and through
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
the church-yard, and by the corner house, and over the stile, till we have got quite into the fields. How pretty the fields will look! for it will be summer days again before we go. And there will be yellow flowers, and white flowers, and grass,
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
and trees, and hedges; and the grasshoppers will chirp, chirp, under our feet. Do not try to catch them; it will only hinder us, and we have a great way to go.</P>
<P>Pray what are those pretty creatures that look so meek and good-natured, and have
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
soft thick white wool upon their backs, like a great coat, and make a noise like the little baby when it cries? Those are sheep and lambs. And what are those creatures with horns, that are bigger than the sheep? Some of them are black, and some
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
red: they make a loud noise, but they do not look as if they would hurt any body. Those are cows that give milk. Stroke them. Poor cows! Stand still and look back. Now we cannot see papa's house at all; and we can see only the top of the
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
church steeple. Let us go a little farther. Now look back. Now we cannot see the church at all. Farewell! We are going a great way. Shall we ever come back again? Yes, we shall come back again; but we must
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
go on now. Come, make haste.</P>
<P>What is that tall thing that has four great arms which move very fast? I believe if I was near it they would strike me down. It is a Wind-mill. Those arms are the sails. The wind
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
turns them round. And what is a wind-mill for? It is to grind corn. You could have no bread if the corn were not ground. Well, but here is a river: how shall we do to get over it? Why do not you see how those ducks do? they swim over.
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
But I cannot swim. Then you must learn to swim, I believe: it is too wide to jump over. O here is a Bridge! Somebody has made a bridge for us quite over the river. That somebody was very good, for I do not know what we should have
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
done without it; and he was very clever too. I wonder now he made it. I am sure I could not make such a bridge.</P>
<P>Well, we must go on, on, on; and we shall see more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ivers, and more fields, and owns bigger than our town
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
a great deal—large towns, and fine churches, streets and people—more than there is at the fair. And we shall have a great many high hills to climb. I believe I must get somebody to carry the little boy up those high hills. And sometimes we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
through dusty sandy roads; and sometimes through green <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>anes, where we shall hear the birds sing. Sometimes we shall go over wide com∣mons, where we shall see no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rees, nor any house; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>arge heaths, where there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hardly any grass—only
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
some purple flowers, and a few black nosed little sheep. Ha! did you see that pretty brown creature that ran across the path? Here is another; and look! there is another: there are a great many. They are Rabbits. They live here, and make themselves houses
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
in the ground. This is a rabbit-warren.</P>
<P>Now we are come amongst a great many trees—more trees than there are in the orchard by a great many; and taller trees. There is oak, and ash, and elm. This is a Wood. What great
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
boughs the trees have! like thick arms. The sun can∣not shine amongst the trees, they are so thick. Look, there is a squirrel! jumping from one tree to another. He is very nimble. What a pret∣ty tail he has!</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46"/>
Well; when we have gone on a great many days, through a great many fields and towns, we shall come to a great deep water, bigger a great many times than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>iver, for you can see over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>he river, you know—you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>an see fields on the other
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
side: but this is so large, and so wide, you can see nothing but water, water, as far as ever you can carry your eyes. And it is not smooth, like the river; it is all rough, like the great pot in the kitchen when it is boiling. And it is so deep
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
it would drown you if you were as tall as two church steeples. I wonder what they call this great water! there is an old, old fisher∣man, sitting upon a stone drying himself; for he is very wet. I think we will ask him. Pray, fisherman,
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
what is this great water? It is the Sea: did you never hear of the sea? What! is this great water the same sea that is in our map at home? Yes, it is. Well, this is very strange! we are come to the sea that is in our map. But it is very little in the
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
map. I can lay my finger over it. Yes; it is little in the map, because every thing is little in the map: the towns are little, and the rivers are little.</P>
<P>Pray, Fisherman, is there any thing on the other side of this sea? Yes; fields,
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
and towns, and people. Will you go and see them? I should like to go very well; but how must we do to get over? for there is no bridge here. Do not you see those great wooden boxes that swim upon the water? They are bigger than all papa's
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
house. There are tall poles in the middle, as high as a tree. Those are masts. See! now they are spread∣ing the sails. Those white sheets are the sails. They are like wings. These wooden boxes are like houses with wings. Yes, and I will
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
tell you what, little boy! they are made on purpose to go over the sea; and the wind blows them along faster than a horse can trot. What do they call them? They call them Ships. You have seen a ship in a picture. Shall we get in? What have
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
those men in the ship got on? they have jackets and trow∣sers on, and checked shirts. They are sailors. I think we will make you a sailor; and then instead of breeches you must have a pair of trowsers. Do you see that sailor, how he climbs up the
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
ropes? He is very nimble. He runs up like a monkey. Now he is at the top of the mast. How little he looks! But we must get in. Come, make haste: they will not stay for us. What are you doing? picking up shells! We must get into a boat
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
first, because the ship is not near enough. Now we are in.</P>
<P>Now we are upon the great sea. Blow, blow wind! Sail away ship! There are little rooms in the ship. Those little rooms are called cabins. Let us walk about,
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
and look at the ship. Why, you cannot walk steady: I am afraid you are tipsy! Be∣cause the ship rolls about. But the sailors can walk steady. The sea is not like the river; it is greenish. Well; here is water enough if we should be thirsty. Yes, here
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
is water enough; but you would not like to drink it. It is salt and bitter. You could not drink it. How fast we go! Now the fields are a great way off. Now we cannot see any green fields at all, nor any houses, nor any thing but the great
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
deep water. It is water all round as far as ever we can see. Yes, and sky; we can see the sky too. All sky over our heads, and all water every where round us! Do not be afraid, little boy! Blow, blow, wind! sail away ship! I see some
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
things in the sea at a great distance. Those are more ships and boats. How very small they are! they look like nut shells in a great pond. O, Now we are com∣ing to the green fields and towns on the other side of the sea! I can see them a
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>
little. Now I can see them very plain. And here is a little piece of green land, with the water running all round it. That is an island. A piece of land with water all round it, is an island. But we are not going there; we are going to the great land.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="62"/>
Now we are at the land, Get out of the ship. Pray what country is this? This is France. France! why France is in the map too. And pray what is the name of that country we came from, where we live, and where papa lives? It is
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
England. And the deep sea is between France and Eng∣land? Yes, you know it is so in the map.</P>
<P>O, France is a pretty place It is warmer than our coun∣try: and here are pretty flowers, and fine fruit, and large grapes. I never saw
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
such large grapes in all my life. And the vines grow in the fields; they do not grow against walls, as our vines do. And there are a great many people, men, and wo∣men, and little boys and girls, singing, and dancing about, and so merry! no∣thing
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
can be like it. I think we will live here, and send for papa and Arthur. Let us go and talk with those people. Here, you little girl! pray give us some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your nice fruit. <HI>Serviteur Monsieur.</HI> What do you say little girl? I do not under∣stand
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
you. I cannot help that. Here is an old man cutting the vines; we will speak to him. Pray, old man, will you give us some of your fruit? We are come a great way to see you. <HI>Serviteur Monsieur.</HI> What do you say? We do not know
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
what <HI>Serviteur Monsieur</HI> is, It is French. But we do not understand French. I can∣not help that; you must go home and learn. And why do you speak French? Be∣cause this is France. Did not you know that every body speaks French in
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
France? Ha, ha, ha! He he, he! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Here is a foolish little boy come a great way over the sea, and does not know that every body speaks French in France. Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho! Here is a foolish little boy
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
come a great way over the sea, and does not know that every body speaks French in France. Ha, ha ha! He he, he! Ho, ho, ho!—What shall we do, little boy? every body laughs at us; and all the little birds twitter and chirp at us. We
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
will go home again. Fare∣well, France! We will not go to France again till papa has taught us to talk French. Let us get into the ship again. Blow, wind! sail away, ship! Now we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ot back again. Pray, papa, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ach the little boy French
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
before he goes a great way abroad again.</P>

<P>You know how many legs a Horse has? Yes, a Horse has four legs. And do you know what an ani∣mal is called that has four
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
legs? It is called a Qua∣druped. The Cow is a quadruped; and the Dog, and the Lion, and all the beasts. But birds are not quadrupeds, for they have only two legs. Some qua∣drupeds have hoofs. The Horse has hoofs; so has the
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
Ass, and the Cow: but the Dog has no hoofs; the Dog has toes with claws; so the Dog is not hoofed, but digi∣tated; and the Cat, and the Squirrel, and a great many more are digitated. The hoof of the horse is whole, it is all in one piece;
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
but the hoof of the Cow is parted, as if it were two hoofs. That is being clo∣ven-footed; the hoof is clo∣ven. The Cow, and the Sheep, and the Hog, and the Stag, are all cloven-footed; but the Horse, and the Ass, have whole hoofs.</P>

<P>The Ass says, I am a Quadruped; I am a very patient good creature. I have hoofs, and very long ears: I bray very loud. The horse is frightened when I bray, and starts back; but
<PB N="77" REF="76"/>
I am very meek, and never hurt any thing. My young ones are colts: I suckle them. I am not so big as a horse, and I cannot gallop fast, but I work very hard. Sometimes I carry little boys on my back, two or three at a time, and they whip
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
me, and prick my sides, to make me go faster. I carry greens to market, and tur∣nips, and potatoes; and sometimes I carry a great load of pans, and mugs, and pots, with which my back is almost broke; and I get nothing for my dinner but
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
a few prickly thistles, and some coarse grass from off the common: and I have no stable to go into as a Horse has; I always lie out in the fields, in the snow, and in the rain; but I am very con∣tented. I give milk as well as the Cow; and my milk is
<PB N="80" REF="79"/>
very good for people that are sick, to make them well again.</P>

<P>Ha! what is there amongst the furze? I can see only its eyes. It has very large full eyes. It is a Hare. It

is in its form, squatting down amongst the bushes to hide itself, for it is very fearful. The Hare is very innocent and gentle. Its colour is brown; but in countries which are very cold it turns white as snow. It has a short bushy tail; its lip
<PB N="82" REF="81"/>
is parted, and very hairy; and it always moves its lips. Its hind egs are very long, that it may run the better. The Hare feeds upon herbs, and roots, and the bark of young trees, and green corn; and sometimes it will creep through the hedge, and steal
<PB N="83" REF="82"/>
into the gardens, to eat pinks and a little parsley; and it loves to play and skip about by moon-light, and to bite the tender blades of grass when the dew is up∣on them; but in the day∣time it sleeps in its form. It sleeps with its eyes open
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
because it is very fearful and timid; and when it hears the least noise it starts and pricks up its large ears. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the huntsman sounds his horn, and the poor harm∣less Hare hears the Dogs com∣ing, then it it runs away very swiftly straight forward, stretch∣ing
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
its legs, and leaves them all behind. But the Dogs pursue her, and she grows tired, and cannot run so fast as at first. Then she doubles, and turns, and runs back to her form, that the hounds may not find her; but they run with their
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
noses to the ground, smel∣ling till they have found her out. So when she has run five or six miles, at last she stops, and pants for breath, and can run no fur∣ther. Then the hounds come up, and tear her, and kill her. Then when she
<PB N="87" REF="86"/>
is dead, her little limbs which moved so fast, grow quite stiff, and cannot move at all. A snail could go faster than a hare when it is dead: and its poor little heart, that beat so quick, is quite still and cold; and its round full eyes are dull and dim;
<PB N="88" REF="87"/>
and its soft furry skin is all torn and bloody. It is good for nothing now but to be roasted.</P>

<P>All birds that swim in the water are web-footed. Their toes are joined together by
<PB N="89" REF="88"/>
a skin that grows between them; that is being web-footed; and it helps the birds to swim well, for then their feet are like the fins of a fish.</P>
<P>The Swan says, My name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Swan: I am a large bird, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>arger than a goose. My bill
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
is red, but the sides of it are black, and I have black about my eyes. My legs are dusky, but my feet are red, and I am web-footed. My body is all white, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> white as snow, and very beautiful. I have a very long neck. I live in rivers and
<PB N="91" REF="90"/>
lakes. I eat plants that grow in the water, and seeds, and little infects, and snails. I do not look pretty when I walk upon the ground, for I cannot walk well at all; but when I am in the water, swimming smoothly along, arching my long neck, and
<PB N="92" REF="91"/>
dipping my white breast, with which I make way through the water, I am the most graceful of all birds. I build my nest in a little island amongst the reeds and rushes. I make it of sticks and long grass: it is very large and high. Then I lay
<PB N="93" REF="92"/>
my eggs, which are white, and very large, larger a great deal than a goose's egg; and I sit upon them for two months; then they are hatched, and my young ones come out. They are called cygnets. They are not white at first, but grey∣ish.
<PB N="94" REF="93"/>
If any body was to come near me when I am in my nest, sitting upon my eggs, or when I have my young ones, I should fly at him; for I am very fierce to defend my young: and if you were to come to take them away, I should beat
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
you down with my strong pinion, and perhaps break your arm. I live a very great while.</P>

<P>The Sun says, My name is Sun: I am very bright. I rise in the east; and when
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
I rise then it is day. I look in at your window with my bright golden eye, and tell you when it is time to get up; and I say, Sluggard, get up: I do not shine for you to lie in your bed and sleep, but I shine for you to get up and work, and
<PB N="97" REF="96"/>
read, and walk about. I am a great traveller, I travel all over the sky; I never stop, and I never am tired. I have a crown upon my head of bright beams, and I send forth my rays every where. I shine upon the trees and the houses, and upon the
<PB N="98" REF="97"/>
water; and every thing looks sparkling and beautiful when I shine upon it. I give you light, and I give you heat, for I make it warm. I make the fruit ripen, and the corn ripen. If I did not shine upon the fields, and upon the gardens nothing would

grow. I am up very high in the sky, higher than all trees, higher than the clouds, higher than every thing. I am a great way off. If I were to come nearer you I should scorch you to death, and I should burn up the grass, for I am all made of

hot glowing fire. I have been in the sky a great while. Four years ago there was no Charles; Charles was not alive then, but there was a Sun. I was in the sky be∣fore papa and mamma were alive, a great many long years ago; and I am not
<PB N="101" REF="100"/>
grown old yet. Sometimes I take off my crown of bright rays and wrap up my head in thin silver clouds, and then you may look at me; but when there are no clouds, and I shine with all my brightness at noon-day, you cannot look at me, for I
<PB N="102" REF="101"/>
should dazzle your eyes, and make you blind. Only the Eagle can look at me then: the Eagle with his strong piercing eye can gaze upon me always. And when I am going to rise in the morning and make it day, the Lark flies up in the sky
<PB N="103" REF="102"/>
to meet me, and sings sweetly in the air: and the Cock crows loud to tell every body that I am coming: but the Owl and the Bat fly away when they see me, and hide themselves in old walls and hollow trees; and the Lion and the Tiger go into their
<PB N="104" REF="103"/>
dens and caves, where they sleep all the day. I shine in all places. I shine in England, and in France, and in Spain, and all over the earth. I am the most beautiful and glorious creature that can be seen in the whole world.</P>

amongst a great many small sparkling diamonds. When you are asleep I shine through your curtains with my gentle beams, and I say Sleep on, poor little tired boy, I will not disturb you. The nightingale sings to me, who sings better than all the

birds of the air. She sits up∣on a thorn and sings melodi∣ously all night long, while the dew lies upon the grass, and every thing is still and silent all around.</P>
