<HEAD>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in GOD
<HI>JOHN,</HI>
Lord Bishop of Oxford.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN the following
<HI>Discourse</HI> was finish'd
and ready for the
<HI>Press,</HI> I consider'd to
what <HI>Bishop</HI> the <HI>Dedi∣cation</HI>
of it would be most accep∣table;
(for I am resolv'd that none
but <HI>Bishops</HI> as yet shall have the
Honour of my <HI>Dedications</HI>;) and
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
I had not long ponder'd upon the
Matter, before I hit upon your
<HI>Lordship,</HI> who must needs be pleas'd
with this <HI>Discourse,</HI> because of the
Advantage, that you, as well as
myself, in the End, will reap by it.</P>
<P>By Virtue of your <HI>Professorship</HI>
at <HI>Oxford,</HI> you, <HI>My Lord,</HI> are a
<HI>Moderator</HI> at theological Disputa∣tions,
as I am here: And whether
the Execution of your Office be
as troublesome as mine is, I know
not: But if the Design of this
<HI>Discourse</HI> take Place, we shall find
that modern Controversies about
Religion are all vain; and there∣upon
be <HI>both</HI> of us soon eas'd of
the Trouble of our <HI>Moderations</HI> at
them.</P>
<P>It may be, <HI>my Lord,</HI> you are not
so weary of your <HI>Moderatorship,</HI>
as I am: Besides, that you are
better paid for your Pains, your
Disputants are more amicable, and
in the midst of their Disputes more
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
tractable: Tho they may warmly
contend, at the present, for and
against the Point in Debate; yet
like <HI>Lawyers</HI> who are no less zea∣lous
for their <HI>Clients</HI> in the Day,
they commonly agree to drink a
Bottle together at Night, and go
to Bed, good Friends. And this
is very well done of them.</P>
<P>But my Disputants, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
call'd <HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Apostates,</HI> at whose
Controversy I have the Trouble,
by the Appointment of the Fathers,
to preside, are more stubborn, tur∣bulent
and refractory. What ill
Treatment they would give each
other, if it was in their Power, I
know not: But my <HI>Apostates,</HI> since
they can't be aveng'd on their
Adversarys, are full of Resentment
against their <HI>Moderator,</HI> because I
am not altogether partial to their
side; and how I shall escape their
Indignation, God alone knows.</P>

Whatever the <HI>Clergy, my Lord,</HI>
whom I dignify with the Title of
<HI>Apostates,</HI> may think, I look upon
myself as a notable <HI>Moderator</HI> of the
Controversy; I have shewn them
all the Favour I can in it, and would
have brought them off with Honor,
but for a <HI>little Flaw,</HI> here discover'd,
in the Foundation of their Church,
which, for the Determination of
our Disputes, must be confefs'd and
granted.</P>
<P>If your <HI>Lordship,</HI> upon reading
this <HI>Discourse,</HI> should be of the
same Mind with me, I beg of you
to Stroak the <HI>Clergy</HI> into Temper,
Patience and Compliance; Tell
them, they have been long ortho∣dox
and glorious Victors over <HI>Infi∣dels,</HI>
and that it would be now an
Act of Generosity to yield to them
in a <HI>small Point</HI>; upon which such
a Pacification would ensue, as no∣thing
hereafter would be able to
dissolve.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
But I have another Favour, <HI>my
Lord,</HI> here to crave of you, that
you wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be pleas'd to persuade
my old Friend the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI>
to stay at Home this <HI>Lent,</HI> and
keep to his <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Fasting,</HI>
for the casting out a certain <HI>Kind</HI>
of—, that by fits he's unhappily
troubled with; or upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubli∣cation
of this <HI>Discourse,</HI> I shall be
in Danger of being soon kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pp'd
for it.</P>
<P>If your <HI>Lordship</HI> will do me that
Favour, then I will do you as good
a Turn; and praise you for your
Doctrine of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI>
preach'd at the Coronation: Tho
many may laugh at your Revival
of that Doctrine, Saying, the <HI>Clergy</HI>
upon an Occasion, which our most
excellent <HI>Sovereign</HI> will never give
them, would again have Recourse to
their <HI>Reserves</HI> and <HI>Distinctions</HI>; yet
I say it was well done of your <HI>Lord∣ship</HI>
to preach it, that the Tongues
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
and the Hands (to Say nothing of
the Hearts) of the <HI>Clergy</HI> might go
together in Subscriptions to <HI>Articles</HI>
and <HI>Homilys</HI>; and so avoid that
Prevarication and Inconsistency,
which some now have no more Wit
than to charge them with.</P>
<P>So not questioning your <HI>Lord∣ship</HI>'s
Approbation of this <HI>Discourse</HI>
and the <HI>Dedication</HI>; nor doubting
but you'll make me as bountiful a
Recompence for it, as any of my
other Episcopal Patrons have done;
I subscribe my self,</P>

<HEAD>A SIXTH
DISCOURSE
ON THE
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<HI>SAVIOUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>ERE goes my sixth and
last <HI>Discourse</HI> on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>Mi∣racles</HI>;
the Subject whereof
is the literal Story of his
own Resurrection; which,
according to the Proposition
in hand, I am to show to consist of Ab∣surditys,
Improbabilitys and Incredibilitys.
And I hope our <HI>Bishops</HI> will quietly per∣mit
the Publication of this <HI>Discourse,</HI> es∣pecially
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
if I assure them, that I mean no∣thing
worse by it, than to make way for
the Understanding, what the Fathers write
of, the mystical Resurrection of <HI>Jesus</HI> out
of the Grave of the Letter of the Law
and the Prophets;, of which mystical Re∣surrection
of our <HI>spiritual Jesus,</HI> the
Evangelical Story of the Resurrection of a
<HI>carnal Christ</HI> is but mere Type and Sha∣dow.</P>
<P>I am so far from designing any Service
to Infidelity by this <HI>Discourse,</HI> that I aim
at the Accomplishment of some of St.
<HI>John</HI>'s Apocalyptical Visions. The Fa∣thers
say that a <HI>Church,</HI> built on the
Letter of the Scriptures, particularly on
the Letter of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles, is <HI>Babylon</HI>;
and that antiliteral Arguments and mys∣tical
Interpretations will be the downfal
of her. Whether there is any Truth in
this Opinion of the Fathers, I am minded
to make the Experiment; and tho I should
bring the old House of the Church over
my Head, and be crush'd to Pieces in its
Ruins, I can't forbear it: But however,
I would advise the <HI>Clergy</HI> to make haste
and <HI>come out of Babylon,</HI> for fear of the
worst; or they, who upon the Authority
of the Fathers are <HI>the Merchants of Ba∣bylon,</HI>
will <HI>weep</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Revelations Ch. xviii. 11.</NOTE> <HI>and mourn</HI> upon her
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
Fall, because <HI>none will buy their Mer∣chandize</HI>
of the Letter <HI>any more.</HI> Dear
<HI>Jesu,</HI> that such a <HI>Student,</HI> as I am, in the
<HI>Revelations</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> and an Inter∣preter
of them too upon the Authority of
the Fathers should be charg'd with Blas∣phemy
and Infidelity!</P>
<P>So to Work I went; and I had not
been long musing by myself, how to sap
this Foundation of the Church, before I
was sensible of my own Insufficiency for
it. Whereupon I sent to my old Friend,
the <HI>Jewish Rabbi,</HI> for his Thoughts on this
grand Miracle of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection,
which he gave me some Promise of But
I desired him to forbear all Ludicrous∣ness,
Satire and Banter for fear of Offence:
For tho our <HI>Clergy</HI> liked Volumes of Jests
and Facetiousness, if they were discharg'd
against <HI>Jews, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI>; yet
when they were levell'd at <HI>Ministers</HI> of
the <HI>Letter</HI> the <HI>Case was alter'd,</HI> as quoth
<HI>Plowden,</HI> and they were not to be born
with. Therefore he was to remember
that decency, seriousness and calmness of
Argument, required by the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
 <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In his Pastoral Letter, p. 35.</NOTE> or I durst not print it.</P>
<P>In Compliance with my Desires he sent
me the following Letter, which, having
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
purg'd it of a few <HI>Puns</HI> and <HI>Cunundrums,</HI>
because all Appearance of <HI>Wit,</HI> as of <HI>Evil,</HI>
was to be abstain'd from, I here publish,
and it runs thus.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to your Request, I here
send you my Thoughts on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Resurrection, in which I shall be shorter
than I would be, because of the customary
Bounds of your <HI>Discourse.</HI></P>
<P>The Controversy between us <HI>Jews</HI> and
you <HI>Christians</HI> about the <HI>Messiah</HI> has hi∣therto
been of a diffusive Nature: But
as the subject of <HI>this</HI> is the Resurrection
of your <HI>Jesus</HI>; so by my Consent, we'll
now reduce the Controversy to a narrow
Compass, and let it turn entirely on this
grand Miracle and Article of your Faith.
If your <HI>Divines</HI> can prove <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resur∣rection
against the following Objections,
then I will acknowledge him to be the
<HI>Messiab,</HI> and will turn Chtistian, other∣wise
he must still pass with us for an
Impostor and false Prophet.</P>
<P>I have often lamented the Loss of such
Writings, which our <HI>Ancestors</HI> unquestio∣nably
dispers'd against <HI>Jesus,</HI> because of
the cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar fight they would give us, into
the Cheat and Imposture of his Religion.
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
But I rejoice and thank God, there is lit∣tle
or no want of them, to the Point in
Hand. For I had not long meditated on
the Story of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection, as your
<HI>Evangelists</HI> have related it, but I plainly
discern'd it to be the most notorious and
monstrous Imposture, that ever was put
upon Mankind. And if you please to at∣tend
to my following Arguments, which
require no depth of Judgment and Capa∣city
to apprehend, I am persuaded that you
and every one disinterested, will be of the
same Mind too.</P>
<P>To overthrow and confute the Story of
this monstrous and incredible Miracle, I was
thinking once to premise an Argument of the
Justice of the Sentence denounc'd against
and executed upon <HI>Jesus,</HI> who was so far
from being the innocent Person, you Chris∣tians
would make of him, that, as may ea∣sily
be proved, he was so grand a <HI>Deceiver,</HI>
<HI>Impostor</HI> and <HI>Malefactor,</HI> as no Punish∣ment
could be too great for him. But
this Argument (which I reserve against
a Day of perfect Liberty, to publish by
itself in Defence of the Honour and Jus∣tice
of our <HI>Ancestors</HI>) would be too long
for the Compass of this Letter; and
therefore I pass it by, tho it would give
Force to my following Objections; it be∣ing
hard and even impossible to imagine,
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
that God would vouchsafe the Favour of
a miraculous Resurrection to one, who for
his Crimes deservedly suffer'd and under∣went
Death.</P>
<P>But waveing, I say, that Argument for
the present, which of itself would be
enough to prejudice a reasonable Man
against the Belief of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection;
I will allow <HI>Jesus</HI> to have been a much
better Man, than I believe him to have
been; or as good a one in Morals as your
Divines do suppose him; and will only
consider the Circumstances of the Evange∣lical
Story of his Resurrection; from
which, if I don't prove it to have been the
most bare-fac'd Imposture that ever was
put upon the World, I deserve for the Va∣nity
of this Attempt a much worse Pu∣nishment
than he for his Frauds endu∣red.</P>
<P>I have sometimes wonder'd, considering
the Nature and Heinousness of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Faults, for which he dy'd, that our <HI>Chief
Priests</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> had any regard to his
Prediction (which was so like a Bambou∣zlement
of the Populace) that he was to rise
again the <HI>third Day</HI> after his Crucifixion.
There's no other Nation in the World,
which would not have slighted such a vain
Prognostication of a known Impostor.
Let him foretel with ever so much Con∣fidence
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
his speedy return to Life, I dare
say, any other Magistrates of ordinary Pru∣dence
would have despised him for a pre∣sumptuous
<HI>Enthusiast</HI>: But, when I reflec∣ted
on the Imposture of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resur∣rection,
and of what pernicious Conse∣quence
it had like to have proved to the
Peace and Welfare of our Nation, if it
had not been happily discover'd, my
Wonder here ceas'd; and I as much ad∣mire
now the Wisdom, Caution and
Circumspection of our <HI>Chief Priests</HI> against
all possible Fraud and Deceit in the fore∣told
Resurrection of <HI>Jesus.</HI> Tho <HI>Jesus</HI>
himself, the Head of the Confederacy, and
prime Projector of the design'd Cheat in
the Case of <HI>Lazarus</HI> was cut off, yet his
Associates were still numerous; and it was
not impossible, but they might concert a
Project of a counterfeited Resurrection of
him, in Accomplishment of his Prophecy,
that might be of more fatal Consequence,
and tend to such Confusions and Distrac∣tions
among the People, as would not be
soon quell'd and quieted. Whereupon our
<HI>Chief Priests</HI> very prudently consider of
Precautions against Cheat here, and wisely
make Application to <HI>Pilat</HI> the <HI>Governor,</HI>
that proper and effectual Measures may be
taken against a false and feign'd Resurrec∣tion,
for Fear of the ill Effects of it.
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
And one of them, as the <HI>Spokesman</HI> of
their Company, seems, according to <HI>Mat∣thew,</HI>
Ch. xxvii. to have made the Speech
following.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> We remember that this De∣ceiver
and Impostor <HI>Jesus,</HI> who was
yesterday crucified and justly suffer'd
Death for his Blasphemy and many De∣lusions
of the People (that were of bad
Consequence, and might have been of
much worse, if he had not been timely
brought to condign Punishment) said
repeatedly before, that notwithstanding
the Death he was to undergo, he should
rise again to Life the <HI>third Day</HI> after.
It is not that we are at all apprehensive
of such a wonderful and miraculous
Event, which knowing him to have
been a false Prophet as well as a de∣ceitful
Juggler, we have no Fears nor
Belief of. But as it is not long since,
that the Inhabitants in and about <HI>Be∣thany</HI>
had like to have been fatally de∣luded
and imposed on by him, in the
pretended Resuscitation of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> one
of his Disciples and Confederates in Ini∣quity;
so it is not altogether impossible
nor improbable bat his Disciples and
Accomplices, who are many, may pro∣ject
a feign'd Resurrection of <HI>Jesus,</HI> (in
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
Accomplishment of his Prediction) by
stealing his Body away, and pretend∣ing
he is risen from the dead. Should
such a Sham-Miracle be contrived a∣mongst
them and cunningly executed it
would be <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (<HI>not an Error but</HI>) an
Imposture of worse Consequence to our
Nation and Religion, than the former
in <HI>Lazarus</HI> could have been, if it had
never been detected: We crave there∣fore
the Favour of your <HI>Excellency,</HI> to
give Command for the making his Se∣pulchre
sure, till the <HI>third Day</HI> is past,
that neither his <HI>dead</HI> Body may be ta∣ken
away, and a Resurrection pretend∣ed;
nor a <HI>living</HI> one slipt into its Place,
and a Miracle counterfeited on that Day,
when we will be present at the opening
of the Sepulchre, and give Satisfaction
to the People of his being a false Pro∣phet.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Whether <HI>Pilat</HI> was at all intent on the
Prevention of Fraud in this Case, or would
not willingly have connived at it, to in∣crease
the Divisions and Distractions of our
then unhappy Nation, may be question'd:
But the Request of our <HI>Chief Priests</HI> was
so reasonable, and their Importunitys so
urgent, that he could not resist them; and
therefore order'd them a <HI>Watch</HI> for the
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
Sepulchre, which they might make as
sure, as they could, against Fraud and
Imposture, till the <HI>third Day.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon our <HI>Chief Priests</HI> deliberate,
what measures were fittest to be taken to
this Purpose. And as I can't, and don't
believe any Man else can, devise any bet∣ter
for the security of the Sepulchre a∣gainst
Fraud, than what they took; so I
admire and applaud their Prudence, Cir∣cumspection,
and Precaution in the Case.
They <HI>seal'd the Stone</HI> at the mouth of the
Sepulchre, and placed a Guard of Sol∣diers
about it; which were <HI>Two</HI> such cer∣tain
means for the Prevention or Detec∣tion
of Cheat in a Resurrection, as are
not to be equall'd by any other.</P>
<P>They <HI>seal'd the Stone</HI> of the Sepulchre,
which, tho it was no Security at all a∣gainst
Violence, yet was an absolute one
against Fraud. How the <HI>Stone</HI> which fit∣ted
the Mouth of the Sepulchre, as a Door
do's the Entrance into a Room, was seal'd,
I need not describe. The use and man∣ner
of sealing of Doors of Closets, of
Chests, and of Papers is common; and
as it is an obvious Expedient, for the
Satisfaction of the Signators, against De∣ceit;
so it has been an antient as well as
a modern Practice. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Daniel. Cap. vi. 17.</NOTE>
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
seal'd the Door of the Den of Lions
wherein <HI>Daniel</HI> was cast, with his own
Signet: And wherefore did He so? For
the Satisfaction of himself and of his Cour∣tiers,
when he came again to open and
compare the Signature with his Signet,
that no Art nor Artifice hid been used for
the Preservation of <HI>Daniel.</HI> So our <HI>Chief
Priests</HI> seal'd the Stone of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Sepul∣chre,
which they design'd to be present at
the opening of, on the <HI>third Day,</HI> the
Time appointed by <HI>Jesus</HI> for his Resur∣rection,
and then give ample Satisfaction
to the People, that there was a real or
could be no Resurrection of his Body.
Wherefore else did they <HI>seal</HI> the Stone of
his Sepulchre?</P>
<P>Your <HI>Grotius</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Adducor ut credam Pilati Annulo et hunc Lapi∣dem signatum. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE> thinks, that <HI>Pilat</HI>'s
Seal was affix'd to the Stone of the Sepul∣chre;
but, as I believe, <HI>Pilat</HI> little con∣cern'd
himself about the Prevention of De∣ceit
here; so I much question it. It is
more reasonable to think that the <HI>Chief
Priests</HI> and other Civil Magistrates of <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI>
with their several Seals, which
could not be open'd but by themselves
without suspicion of Fraud, sign'd the
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
Stone, and intended to be present, on the
Day appointed, at the opening of the
Sepulchre; not doubting, what no body
could question, but <HI>Jesus</HI> would wait their
coming, and arise to Life if he could, in
the sight of themselves, and of a vast Con∣course
of People, that were sure to at∣tend
on them to behold the Miracle. Such
a Resurrection would have been of Satis∣faction
to the whole Nation; and such a
Resurrection, reasonably speaking, <HI>Jesus</HI>
would, if he could, have vouchsafed in
Accommodation to the <HI>sealing</HI> of the
<HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>But, notwithstanding this Precaution,
in sealing of the Stone, the best that could
be taken against Fraud, <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Body
was privately slipt off, early in the Morn∣ing
of the Day before, and a Resurrection
pretended by his Disciples; and you
would have us and our Ancestors to be∣lieve,
there was no Deceit in the Case;
tho confessedly none of the <HI>Sealers</HI> of
the Sepulchre were present: Who can
believe it? Was or can there be any
Imposture more against: Sense and Reason
palm'd upon the Understandings of Man∣kind?
If there had been a real Resurrecti∣on,
the <HI>Sealers</HI> of the <HI>Stone</HI> would have
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
been the <HI>Openers</HI> of the Sepulchre; where∣fore
else was the <HI>Stone seal'd</HI>?</P>
<P>A Question, that here arises, is, On
what Day and what Time of the Day,
did our <HI>Chief Priests,</HI> the Sealers of the
Stone, expect, what they could not think
would ever come to pass, <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resur∣rection?
Or what was the Extent of the
Time meant by <HI>Jesus,</HI> when he said that
after <HI>three Days,</HI> or on the <HI>third Day</HI> after
his Passion, he should rise again? if any
Impostor or Prophet like <HI>Jesus</HI> should in
this Age so predict his Resurrection, and
be executed on a <HI>Fryday,</HI> the Day for his
Resurrection would be presumed to be
<HI>Monday,</HI> and not <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning before
Day. And I humbly conceive former
Ages and Nations, and our Nation in
particular did compute after this Fashion.
Accordingly on <HI>Monday</HI> our <HI>Chief Priests,</HI>
I don't doubt, intended to be present at
the opening of the Seals of the Sepulchre,
and to behold the Miracle: But <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Body was clandestinely moved off early
on <HI>Sunday,</HI> (the Day before <HI>that</HI> signified
and predicted for his Resurrection) to the
Laughter more than to the surprize of our
Ancestors, at the Notoriety of the Fraud
committed, and at the Vanity of a Re∣surrection
pretended upon it. And I may
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
appeal, even to your <HI>Chief Priests</HI> of the
Church, whether here's not another Note
of Cheat and Imposture; and whether
the Disciples were not afraid to trust <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Body, it's full time, in the Grave;
because of the greater Difficulty to carry
it off afterwards, and pretend a Resur∣rection
upon it.</P>
<P>But because your <HI>Divines</HI> (who have
singular Knacks at making two Nights and
a full Day, that <HI>Jesus</HI> was buried, to be
<HI>three Days</HI> and <HI>three Nights</HI>; and whose
various Ways of Computation I always smile
at) do assert that <HI>Sunday</HI> was the <HI>third Day,</HI>
on which, in Accomplishment of <HI>Jonah</HI>'s
Prophecy, and of his own Prediction, he
was to rise again; I will suppose so with
them, and will, if they please, grant that
our <HI>Chief Priests,</HI> the <HI>Sealers</HI> of the Sepul∣chre,
expected his Resurrection on that Day,
and intended, for the opening of the Seals,
to be present at it.</P>
<P>But at what Time of Day were they
to come or could be expected at the Se∣pulchre?
Not long before Noon. But
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Body was gone betimes in the
Morning, before our <HI>Chief Priests</HI> could
be out of their Beds; and a barefaced In∣fringment
of the Seals of the Sepulchre was
made against the Laws of Honour and
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
Honesty, and a Resurrection confidently
talk'd of by the Disciples; and yet your
Christian Priesthood at this Day would
have us to believe, there was no Fraud
and Deceit in all this! O most mon∣strous!</P>
<P>If our <HI>Chief Priests</HI> had trespass'd upon
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Patience, and would not attend at
the Sepulchre for the opening of the Seals,
on the Day and Time appointed; if they
hid been for confining him longer in the
Grave than was meet, according to Pro∣phecy,
then his Resurrection, without their
Presence, had been excusable and justifiable.
But this his pretended Rising to Life,
not only a Day before the Chief Priests
could imagine he would, or earlier in the
Morning than he should, for the Sake of
their requisite Presence, is, together with
the Fracture of the Seals against the Law
of Security, such a manifest and indispu∣table
Mark and Indication of Fraud, as is
not to be equall'd in all or any of the
Impostures, that ever were attempted to be
put upon the World.</P>
<P>In short, by the Sealing of the Stone
of the Sepulchre we are to understand
nothing less than a Covenant enterd into,
between our <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> and the <HI>Apostles,</HI>
by which <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Veracity, Power and
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
<HI>Messiahship</HI> was to be try'd. Tho we read
not of the Apostles giving their Consent to
the Covenant, yet it was reasonably pre∣sum'd
and could not have been refus'd, if
ask'd. The Condition of the seal'd Cove∣nant
was, that if <HI>Jesus</HI> arose from the dead
in the Presence of our <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> upon
their opening the Seals of the Sepulchre,
at the Time appointed; then was he to be
acknowledg'd to be the <HI>Messiah</HI>: But if he
continued in a corrupt and putrified state
of Mortality, then was he to be granted
to be an <HI>Impostor</HI>: Very wisely and right∣ly
agreed! And if the Apostles had stood
to this Covenant, Christianity had been
nipt in its Bud, and suppress'd in its Birth.
But they had other Views and another
Game to play at all Adventures. The
Body was to be removed and a Resur∣rection
pretended to the Delusion, it pos∣sibe,
of all Mankind, in which they have
been more successful than could be imagin'd
upon a Project that had so little Sense or
Reason, so little Colour of Truth or Arti∣fice
in the Contrivance and Execution of
it. Our <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> were apprehensive
at first of their stealing the Body away,
and pretending a Resurrection: Bat af∣ter
the <HI>sealing</HI> of the <HI>Stone,</HI> those fears
vanish'd; because upon the stealing the
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
Body, away against such security and Pre∣caution,
the Fraud would be felf evident,
and want no Demonstration and Proof of
it. Bur, for all this Precaution, I say, the
Body was in a barefaced Manner taken
away, a Resurrection talk'd of, and to the
Amazement of every one, who can think
freely, has been beleived thro' all Ages
of the Church since. Upon the whole
then, I think, you may as well say, when
a seal'd Closet is broken open, and the
Treasure gone without the Privity of the
Signators, that there's no wrong done; as
that in the Resurrection of <HI>Jesus,</HI> there
was no Fraud. The Cases are equal and
parallel. What then can your Christian,
<HI>Priests</HI> say to this demonstrative Argu∣ment
of a manifest and bare-faced Cheat
in <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection? I have been
thinking, what they will or can say;
and upon the maturest Consideration I
don't find they can make any other than
one or more of these shuffling Answers to
it, <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it was impossible for the Dis∣ciples
to Steal the Body of <HI>Jesus</HI> away,
because of the Watchfulness of the Guards;
and therefore there was a real Resurrec∣tion,
tho the <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> and <HI>Sellers</HI>
of Sepulchre were not present at it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="18" REF="27"/>2. That tho the <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> and <HI>Seal∣ers</HI>
of the stone of the Sepulchre were
not presenr, as I say they ought to
have been, to behold the Miracle; yet
his Resurrection was afterwards made as
manifest to them, as if they had been
there present.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That if <HI>Jesus</HI> did not really arise
from the dead, the Beleif of his Resur∣rection
could never have been so propaga∣ted
at first, nor would have been retain'd
in the World for so many Ages since.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I can think of no other Answers, and
believe it impossible for your Christian
<HI>Priests</HI> to form any other, to the fore∣said
Argument of Fraud in <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Re∣surrection:
But how weak, frivolous and
insufficient they all and every one are,
will appear upon a little Examination in∣to
them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, against the foresaid demon∣strative
Argument of Fraud, it may be
pretended, <HI>That it was impossible for the
Disciples to steal the Body of</HI> Jesus <HI>away,
because of the Watchfulness of the Guards;
and therefore there was a real Resurrec∣tion,
tho the</HI> Cheif Priests, <HI>the</HI> Sealers <HI>of
the Sepulchre were not present at it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="28"/>
To which I reply, and confess, that if
it was impossible to evade the Guards of
the Sepulchre, then there was a real Resur∣rection;
but if there was but a bare Pos∣sibility
of evading them, then this Answer
is of no Force. And I am of Opinion,
that the Thing was not only possible,
but easy, feassible, and practicable. Tho
the <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers were of as much Fi∣delity
and Integrity as any of their Pro∣fession;
yet it is well known, that such
Creatures are subject to Bribery and Cor∣ruption,
if the Disciples had any Money
to tempt them with: Or if their Faith∣fulness
to their Trust was untainted;
yet it is not improbable, but their Offi∣cers,
at the Direction of <HI>Pilat,</HI> who found
his Account in the Distractions of our
Nation, might give them the Hint to wink
hard, at the Commission of such a Fraud.
But not to insist on either of these Ways
to evade the <HI>Watch</HI>; our Ancestors said,
what your <HI>Evangelist</HI> has recorded, that
the Disciples, taking the opportunity
of the sleep of the Guards, carry'd the
Body of <HI>Jesus</HI> off; which was a thing
both possible and probable.</P>
<P>Of what Number the <HI>Watch</HI> did consist
is uncertain. Your <HI>Whitly</HI> <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Upon the Place in <HI>Matthew.</HI></NOTE> says they
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
were <HI>sixty</HI>; but he has no Reason nor Au∣thority
to think, they were so many. If
they had been to be a Guard against Vio∣lence,
I should easily have believed they
were more; but in as much as they were
only a <HI>Watch</HI> against Fraud, and against any
casual defaceing of the <HI>Seals</HI> on the Stone,
before the <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> came to open the
Sepulchre, <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> Soldiers were
sufficient, and I don't think, there were
any more set to this Purpose.</P>
<P>It is not then at all improbable, that so
few Soldiers should be fast asleep at that
time of Night, or so early in the Morn∣ing,
when the clandestine Work was done;
especially after keeping such a <HI>Gaudy day,</HI>
as was the Feast of the Passover, which,
like the Festivals of other Nations, was
celebrated with Excess. Foot Soldiers
then, you may be sure, upon the Bounty
of one or other did no more want, than
they would scruple to take their <HI>Fill,</HI>
which like an Opiat lock'd up their Senses
for that Night, when the Disciples, be∣ing
aware of the lucky opportunity, car∣ry'd
the Body of <HI>Jesus</HI> off safely.</P>
<P>And where's the Absurdity to suppose,
that the Disciples themselves might con∣trive
the Intoxication of the Guards?
<HI>Herodotus</HI> tells us a Story of a dead-Body's
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
being stolen away by such an
Artifice. And I don't think the Disci∣ples
of <HI>Jesus</HI> either so foolish or con∣scientious
as not to take the Hint and
enterprise the like Fraud. <HI>Peter,</HI> who
upon occasion, could <HI>swear</HI> and <HI>curse</HI>
like a <HI>Trooper,</HI> would hardly scruple to
fuddle a few <HI>Foot-Soldiers.</HI> But which
way soever it came to pass, the
Watch were asleep, which is neither hard
to conceive nor believe; and then the
Disciples executed <HI>that</HI> Fraud, which has
been the Delusion of Nations and Ages
since.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Evangelists</HI> would hint that the
<HI>Cheif Priests</HI> gave Money to the Soldiers
to say, they were asleep, when the Dis∣ciples
stole the Body of <HI>Jesus</HI> away,
as if they were brib'd to a false Testi∣mony;
but there neither was nor could
be any such Thing. If there had been a
real Resurrection to their Astonishment
and Amazement, as it is represented in
your Gospels, no Money could so soon
have corrupted them to a false Witness,
being under such Fears of God and of
<HI>Jesus.</HI> I don't doubt but our <HI>Cheif
Priests</HI> might reward the Soldiers for speak∣ing
the Truth, and exhort them to per∣sist
in it, with a Promise to <HI>secure</HI> them
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
against the Anger of <HI>Pilat</HI> for their sleep∣ing
and neglect of their Duty.</P>
<P>Here then is no <HI>Answer</HI> to the foresaid
Argument or Objection against <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Resurrection. It was not at all impossible
for the Disciples, who stole the Body
away, to avoid the Guards, who were
and may reasonably be supposed to be
lull'd asleep, when the Disciples did it.
Neither is there any more Force in the</P>
<P N="2">2. Second Answer to it, <HI>viz. That
tho the Cheif Priests, the sealers of the
Stone of ths Sepulchre, were not present,
opening the Seals and beholding the Mi∣racle;
yet his Resurrection was after∣wards
as manifest to them, as if they
had been there present.</HI></P>
<P>Ay, this is somewhat like an Answer, if
there be any Truth in it. A Manifestation
of <HI>Christ risen</HI> afterwards to our <HI>Cheif Priests</HI>
would have been equivalent to their Pre∣sence
at, and sight of the Miracle. But
how was his Resurrection manifested to
them? did <HI>Jesus</HI> ever afterwards appear
personally to them, to their satisfaction,
that he was the same Person, whom they
crucified and put to Death for a Deceiver
and false Prophet? No; this is not once
asserted by your <HI>Evangelists</HI> or ever insi∣nuated
by any antient or modern Writer.
How then was <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection made
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
manifest to our Cheif Priests? Why; your
<HI>Divines</HI> say, what is all that can be said
here, that the Words of the Disciples, who,
being Men of Honesty, Simplicity and In∣tegrity,
would not Lye, are to be taken
for it. Very fine indeed! our Cheif Priests
are to take the Words of the Disciples for
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection, and look upon them
as Men of Veracity, when they knew and
experienc'd them to be grand Cheats, not
only in Stealing the Body of <HI>Jesus</HI> away,
but in the <HI>known Imposture</HI> of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s
Resurrection, or your <HI>Evangelist</HI> had never
implicitly called it so. When therefore
Deceivers will not be <HI>Lyers</HI>; nor Theives,
<HI>Dissemblers</HI> of the Fact, they are accused of,
I will own <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection to have
been manifest enough to our <HI>Cheif Priests.</HI>
There's no Need of more Argument here;
He that bestows more Words on it, loses
Time.</P>
<P>It has been a Constant Objection of us
<HI>Jews</HI> against the Resurrection of <HI>Jesus,</HI>
that he appear'd not personally afterwards
to our <HI>Cheif Priests,</HI> to <HI>Pilat</HI> and to others
his Crucifiers and Insultors, to upbraid
them with their Infidelity and ill Treat∣ment
of him. Whether <HI>Jesus</HI> would not
have done so, if he really arose from the
dead; and whether he ought not in Rea∣son,
for the Conviction and Conversion of
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
Unbeleivers, to have done so, with me is
no Question. <HI>Celsus</HI> of old <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Si Jesus volebat revera declarare suam divinam Potentiam, debuerat suis Insultatoribus, ipsi{que} Praesidi qui capitalem sententiam contra se tulerat, denique cae∣teris omnibus se ostendere. <HI>In Orig. Lib.</HI> ii. <HI>contra Cel∣sum.</HI></NOTE> in the
Name of the <HI>Jews</HI> made the Objection;
and <HI>Olibio,</HI> a late <HI>Rabbi</HI> <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In Limborchii Arnica Collatione cum Judaeo.</NOTE> has repeated it.
But in all my Reading and Conversation
with Men or Books I never met with a
tolerable Answer to it. <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Lim∣borch,</HI>
the Writers against <HI>Celsus</HI> and
<HI>Olibio,</HI> gently slide over the Objection, as
if it was too hot or weighty to be touch'd
and handled by them. To recite the poor,
short and insufficient Answers of those
two great Authors, to the Objection,
would be the Exposing of them, and
giving such Strength to the Objection,
which it don't want. Therefore I will
leave the Objection, which <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Magna Sane Res et miranda occurrit hoc loco, quae non Solum aliquem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vulgo Credentium exercere posset, Sed perfectiores etiam; cur non Dominus post Resurrectionem aeque ac superioribus temporibus conspi∣ciendum se praebuerit. <HI>In Lib.</HI> ii. cont. <HI>Celsum.</HI></NOTE>
owns to be a considerable one, to the
Meditation of your modern Advocates for
Christianity; and when they can prove,
that <HI>Jesus</HI> after his Resurrection did per∣sonally
appear to his Crucifiers, the <HI>Cheif</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="34"/><HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Sealers</HI> of the Sepulchre, to
their Confutation; or that, according
to the Law of Reason, he ought not to
have appeared to them, then I will turn
<HI>Christian</HI> and grant that in the Argu∣ment
above, which proves plain Fraud
in the Resurrection, there's no Force nor
Truth. In the mean time <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Non-Appearance
to the <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> is a Con∣firmation,
that he did not arise from the
Dead, bat that his Body was stolen away,
or he would have waited in the Grave,
the coming of the Sealers of the Stone,
and their regular opening of the Sepul∣chre,
to the Conviction and Conversion
of all there present and Confirmation of
the Faith of all Ages and Nations since,
But,</P>
<P N="3">3. A third Answer to the foresaid Ar∣gument
of Fraud in the Resurrection of
<HI>Jesus,</HI> drawn from the Nature, Use and
Design of sealing the Stone of the Sepul∣chre,
is, <HI>that tho the</HI> Sealers <HI>of the Sepul∣chre
were not present, opening the Seals
and beholding the Miracle; yet</HI> Jesus <HI>did
certainly arise from the Dead, or the Be∣lief
of his Resurrecton could never have
been at first propagated by the Apostles,
nor would for so many Ages of the Church
since have stood its Ground.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="35"/>
Here's as little Reason in this Answer
as in either of the two former. Who
knows not, that many Errors in Philoso∣phy,
and as many Frauds in Religion have
been sometimes accidentally, sometimes
designedly espous'd and palm'd upon Man∣kind,
who in Process of Time become so
wedded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them thro' Prejudice and In∣terest,
that they will not give themselves
Leave to enquire into the Rise and Foun∣dation
of them. False Miracles have been
common Things among Christians; and as
the Resurrection of <HI>Jesus</HI> is their grand
and fundamental one, so it is not at all
difficult to account for the Rise, Propa∣gation
and Continuance of the Belief of
it.</P>
<P>Why it has been believed thro' these
latter Ages of the Church, is no Wonder
at all. The Priests had their Interest in
it; the ignorant and superstitious had
their Comfort in it; and the wise and
considerate, for Fear of Persection, durst
not enquire into the Grounds of it.</P>
<P>The only difficulty here is to know,
upon what Principle, the Project and
Story of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection was at first
devised. And whether it was Ambition
or Revenge upon our ancient and phari∣saical
Priesthood, that prompted the Apo∣stles
to it, is all one to me. Such bad
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
Principles too often put Men upon des∣perate
Attempts. But however, an Im∣posture
it was, for the Argument above.
To say, the Apostles and Confederates
in the Fraud would not have stood to it,
and have dy'd for it, if the Resurrec∣tion
had not been real Fact, signifies
nothing. Many Cheats and Criminals,
besides them, have asserted their Inno∣cency,
and deny'd their Guilt in the ut∣most
exrremity of Death, without the like
Views of Honour and Fame. The only
Thing, that's surprising and astonishing
in this Sham-Miracle, is that, tho it
was the most manifest, the most bare∣faced,
and the most self evident Imposture
that ever was put upon the World; yet
it has been the most fortunate and suc∣cessful,
having past thro' many Ages and
Nations with Reputation and Renown;
and might have continued for as many
Generations to come, but for the Argu∣ment
above, that perfectly and clearly o∣verthrows
its Credit.</P>
<P>But, some may say here, where was
the Wisdom and Providence of God, all
this while, to suffer so many Ages and
Nations to labour under such a Delu∣sion?
Why, I'll tell you; The Provi∣dence
of God in it was, "To humble
Mankind, in the End, for their vain
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
Ostentation of Wisdom, Learning and
<HI>Science falsly so call'd</HI>; "To shame
them for their Madness and Wicked∣ness
to persecute one another for different
Opinions in that Religion, whose very
Foundation is false and groundless;
"To caution them against a blind and
implicit Faith for the future; against
believing any thing out of the sight and
reach of their Understandings; "To ad∣monish
them of the necessity of Liberty
to think, speak and write freely about
Religion, for the Correction of Errors
and Discovery of Truth; and lastly,
"To reduce the World when it should be
ripe for it, to the golden Religion of
Nature, which upon the Testimony of our
old <HI>Cabalistical</HI> Doctors, and of your <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
himself, is the <HI>End of the Law and
the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>And thus have I spoken to the <HI>An∣swers,</HI>
which your <HI>Christian Priesthood</HI>
may be presumed to make, to the foresaid
Argument of Fraud in <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resur∣rection,
drawn from the Design of our
<HI>Cheif Priests</HI> in sealing of the Stone of
his Sepulchre. I should not have con∣cern'd
myself to speak to these their
supposed <HI>Answers,</HI> but to save them the
Trouble of making; them, and the Imagi∣nation
of there being some Force in
them.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="38"/>
As to the Stories, in your <HI>Evangelists,</HI>
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s several Appearances after his
pretended Resurrection, sometimes to the
Women, and at other Times to his Dis∣ciples,
I am not at all obliged to refute
them. If these Appearances had been
more frequent, better circumstanced, and
more solemnly averr'd, they would have
wanted no Confutation. There's no doubt
on't, but the Disciples, who, for the Ar∣gument
above, unquestionably stole <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Body away, in order to pretend a
Resurrection, would talk much of his
appearing to them, and of the Conver∣sation
afterwards, they had with him.
And if they had told better and more plau∣sible
Tales of their fight of, and Conver∣sition
with him, it would be nothing to
the Purpose; <HI>better,</HI> I say, <HI>and more plau∣sible
Tales</HI> than those upon Record, which
for Absurdity, Nonsense and Incoherence
carry their own Confutation along with
them.</P>
<P>Whoever blends together the various
History of the four <HI>Evangelists,</HI> as to <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Appearances after his Resurrection,
will find himself, not only perplex'd how
to make an intelligible, consistent, and sen∣sible
Story of it; but must; with <HI>Celsus</HI> <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Quamvis Celsus has Jesu post Resurrectionem Ap∣paritiones conferre conetur cum vulgaribus Spectris &amp; Visionibus. <HI>In Origen. Lib.</HI> ii. <HI>contra Celsum.</HI></NOTE>,
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
needs think it, if he closely think on't,
like some of the confused and incredible
womanish Fables of the Apparitions of the
Ghosts of deceased Persons, which the
Christian World in particular has in former
Ages abounded with. The Ghosts of the
Dead in this present Age, and especially
in this Protestant Country have ceas'd to
appear; and we now-a-days hardly ever
hear of such an Apparition: And what is
the Reason of it? Why, the Beleif of these
Storys being banish'd out of Men's Minds,
the crafty and vaporous forbear to trump
them upon us. There has been so much
clear Proof of Fraud in many of these
Storys, that the wise and considerate Part
of Mankind has rejected them all, except∣ing
<HI>this</HI> of <HI>Jesus,</HI> which to Admiration
has stood its Ground. It's no wonder in∣deed,
that the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are more in∣credulous
than other Folks as to Storys of
Apparitions, do stick to this of <HI>Jesus,</HI> the
only one excepted out of all others. It
is a sweet morsel of Faith, and they rea∣dily
swallow and digest it, because they
live by it; otherwise <HI>this</HI> Story of <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Appearances after Death had hardly
escaped the Fate of other Apparitions;
nay, would have been rejected, one of the
first of them; there being hardly one,
I dare say it, among all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Storys of
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
Apparitions, were they to be collected to∣gether;
that's more absurd and incredible
than <HI>this</HI> of <HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>I have not here Room to make any Re∣marks
on your Evangelical Story of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Apparitions after his Death; and if I had, I
durst not do it, for fear of an offensive
Ludicrousness, and of transgressing the
Rules of <HI>Decency, Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Sedateness</HI>
of Argument, you have confined me to.
But however, 1 can't read the Story with∣out
smiling, and there are two or three
Passages in it, that put me in mind of
<HI>Robinson Cruso</HI>'s filling his Pockets with
Biskets, when he had neither Coat, Wast∣coat
nor Breeches on. Sometimes I think
your <HI>Evangelists</HI> wanted Wit to adapt
their Tale to Sense, and to accommodate
the Transaction to Nature; and sometimes
I think them crafty, and were minded,
like <HI>Daniel de Foe</HI> in his foresaid <HI>Romance,</HI>
to put the Banter upon the Credulity of
Mankind, with some disguised and latent
Absurdities, that, in the Conclusion and
Discovery, they might be heartily laugh'd
at for the Belief of them, I dare not,
I say, so much a hint at one of these
Absurdities, least I should be unwarily
tempted to crack a Jest on it. But the
Time, I hope, is coining, when I shall
use more Freedom. And should your
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
Priesthood, in Proof of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resut∣rection,
urge any of these Storys of his
corporal Presence and Appearance after
it, then I trust, they'll permit me to
to make as merry Descants on them, as
your <HI>Bishops,</HI> when Academical <HI>Jesters,</HI>
used to do on other Men's Bulls
and Blunders.</P>
<P>In the mean time I depend on the
foregoing single, sober and sedate Argu∣ment
of Fraud in this grand Miracle,
which I found on the Nature and De∣sign
of sealing the Sepulchre; and for
Confirmation of my Opinion and Proof
of Fraud in it, will conclude this Letter
with a parallel Case and Story, Not
many Years since, one Dr. <HI>Emms,</HI> of the
Society of the French Prophets, who in
their Inspirations were, like <HI>Jesus</HI> and his
Disciples of old, Declaimers against the
Pharisaical Priesthood of this Age, did by
himself, or some of his Fraternity did for
him, predict his Resurrection on a certain
Day, when there was a Concourse of Peo∣ple
about his Grave in vain to behold
the Miracle, as there would have been a∣bout
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Sepulchre, if he had lain
in it, his full Time. But supposing in
this Case, that the Magistrates and Priest∣hood
of this City, to prevent a Cheat and
Delusion of the People, had interred the
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
<HI>Doctor</HI> in a Chnrch-Vault, and seal'd the
Door of it against the Day appointed for
his Resurrection, commanding a <HI>Night-Watch</HI>
to look to the Vault the no Vio∣lence
or Deceit be used: This would
have been a wise Precaution against Fraud,
as was in the Case of <HI>Jesus.</HI> But what
if his Fraternity, having a Mind, like <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Disciples to bambouzle the People
and Priesthood, had, some of them drawn
the Watch aside to a <HI>Gin-shop,</HI> whilst o∣thers
carry'd the Body off, pretending a
Resurrection? What would all reasonable
Men have said here? That it was an
impudent and bare-faced Imposture. But
to carry on the Farce; supposing, the
<HI>Doctor</HI>'s Fraternity had afterwards averr'd
that they had seen and convers'd with him
alive, several Times, as before his Death;
and had told particular Storys of their
Conversation with him; as <HI>first</HI> of all,
how he appear'd to some of their Women
(who were admonish'd of the Certainty of
his Resurrection by a Youth or an An∣gel
or two, they could not tell whether,
but they were as like to Angels, which
they never saw before in their Lives, as
Youths could be) who knew him, not by
his Countenance, for <HI>their Eyes were holden,</HI>
as by his Talk on Scripture-Prophecy,
which was his usual Cant before his
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
Death. And at another Time he appear'd
to his old Acquaintance, who knew him,
not by the Features of his Face, but by
an habitual Motion and Action of his
Hand in <HI>breaking of Bread.</HI> And at ano∣ther
Time he was corporally present, but
<HI>they thought, they saw a Spirit.</HI> About
<HI>eight Days after that,</HI> he appear'd among
more of his old Friends, but for all their
former Intimacy with him, some of them
<HI>doubted</HI> whether it was the <HI>Doctor</HI> or
not. At another Time he came to them
in <HI>another Form</HI> and Shape, unlike to his
pristin one, but they were sure it was <HI>He</HI>
by his Exposition of the Scripture. At
another Time, when they were assembled
together and the Doors were lock'd <HI>for
fear of the Clergy,</HI> the <HI>Doctor</HI> slipt unex∣pectedly
into their Company, either from
behind a Curtain, or miraculously en∣ter'd
at the Key-hold. And the last Time
he appear'd, there was one of his intimate
Friends had not known him, but by a
<HI>Sore</HI> in his Breast, which the Power of
God in his Resurrection did not heal:
After which, they said, he <HI>vanish'd away,</HI>
<HI>was taken up into Heaven,</HI> and they saw
him no more. Supposing, I say, the
<HI>French</HI> Prophets had told such like Sto∣rys
of <HI>Doctor Emms</HI>'s Resurrection, and
of his Appearances to them; what would
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
your Priests and all other wise Men have
said to it? Why, that it was all idle
Tales, manifest Lyes, Sham, and lmpos∣ture;
and that if the <HI>Doctor,</HI> in Confu∣tation
of the Errors of your Priests, had
risen to Life, God would have kept him
in his Sepulchre, his full time, and have
rais'd him in the Presenee of Priests,
Magistrates and People; and that he
would have walk'd afterwards publickly
in the Streets without Danger, to the
Satisfaction of all, who knew him, that
he was the same <HI>Emms</HI> who died and
was bury'd: <HI>Without Danger,</HI> I say, from
the Populace, who would have been so
far from affronting him, that they would
have almost adored him for the miracu∣lous
Favour, God had done him in his
Resurrection from the dead; and that
he would never have skulk'd about and
absconded himself for <HI>forty Days</HI> toge∣ther,
before he was pretendedly translated;
and therefore there was nothing but no∣torious
Deceit and Imposture in all these
Pretences.</P>
<P>I need not make the Application of this
Case and Story, which your <HI>Priests</HI> know
how to do for me. To say here, that
there's none would be so desperate to en∣gage
in such a Fraud, as is the supposed
Case of Dr. <HI>Emms</HI> above, is a mistake.
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
Many Thousands for their Diversion
would enterprise it; and the Storys of
the Apparitions of Ghosts, which are
almost all the Frauds of the Crafty to
delude the ignorant, do prove it. I my
felf would be forward to concert such an
Intrigue, if it was but to put the Ban∣ter
upon the <HI>Clergy,</HI> to ruffle their Tem∣pers,
and secretly to laugh at them. No∣thing
would deter me from it, but fears
of the Civil Magistrate, which was not
the Danger of the Disciples of <HI>Jesus</HI>; be∣cause
<HI>Pilat,</HI> for the sake of Rule over
the <HI>Jews,</HI> was a Countenancer of every
Faction amongst them; and particularly
 <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Comminatus est Periculum Accusatoribus Chris∣tianorum. <HI>Tertul. Apol Cap.</HI> v.</NOTE> <HI>Tiberius,</HI> upon <HI>Pilat</HI>'s Representa∣tion
of the matter, soon commanded that
the Disciples of <HI>Jesus</HI> should not be mo∣lested,
nor call'd into Question: So the
Disciples stood to the Fraud, told the
Story of <HI>Jesus risen</HI> so often, till they
believed it themselves, and drew Multi∣tudes
into the Belief of it: Which Belief
must have continued thro' all Genera∣tions
to come, but for my Argument of
Fraud, before urg'd and argued.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, before I conclude this Let∣ter,
I think it my Duty however to give
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
you may Opinion of the Religion, that
<HI>Jesus</HI> and his Disciples were for intro∣ducing
into the World. Tho I beleive,
what I have proved, his Resurrection to
be a Piece of Fraud, and his other Mira∣cles
to have been all Artifice; and tho
our <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> and ancient Nation are
justifiable in the Sentence, that was pass'd
and executed upon <HI>Jesus</HI>; yet I must
do him and his Disciples the Justice, to
own, that the Doctrine they taught was
for the most Part of it, good, ufeful and
popular, being no other than the Law
and Religion of Nature, which, all Na∣tions
being wearied with their own Super∣stitions,
and sick of the Burthen of their
Priests, ran apace into. Accordingly one
 <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Justin Martyr. <HI>In Apol.</HI> ii.</NOTE> of your ancient Fathers says, that
they <HI>who lived according to the Law of
Nature, were true Christians.</HI> And I must
needs say, that if Christians, in Process
of Time, had not sophisticated this primi∣tive
Religion of <HI>Jesus</HI>; If they had not
built their systematical Divinity upon
him, and brought strange Inventions of
Men into his Worship; If lastly, they had
not again subjugated and entangled them∣selves
with another and worse Yoke of
Bondage to an intolerable and tyrannical
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
Priesthood of the Church, the World
might have enjoy'd great Happiness un∣der
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Religion, even <HI>that Happi∣ness</HI>
which is now only to be expected
upon a Disproof of his miraculous Resur∣rection,
that has been the Foundation of a
most confused Superstructure of wild
Doctrines and Opinions: Or more true∣ly
speaking, <HI>That Happiness</HI> of the state
of Nature, Religion and Liberty, which
may be look'd for upon the coming of
our <HI>Messiah,</HI> the allegorical Accomplisher
of the Law and the Prophets; whose Ad∣vent,
upon the Tradition of our <HI>Cabalists,</HI>
will be toward the latter End of the
<HI>Sixth</HI> grand Age of the Creation, to re∣move
from our Faces and our Hearts the
Vail of the Letter; and in the mean
while I adhere to the umbratical Rites,
Ceremonies and way of Worship, derived
from our Forefathers.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I finish'd my <HI>Letter</HI> on
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection; and whether I hive
not said enough to justify our <HI>Jewish</HI>
Disbeleif of that Miracle, let your <HI>Cheif
Priests</HI> judge. I don't expect my Argu∣ment
against it will be convincing of
any of your Preachers. They have a
potent Reason for their Faith, which
we <HI>Jews</HI> can't come at; or I don't know,
but we might believe with them.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="48"/>
I trust you'll meet with no Molestati∣on
for the Publication of this <HI>Letter</HI>;
neither do I think, it was any thing of
mine, inserted in your Discourses, that
at any time brought Trouble on you.
It was your own Imprudence to rave,
as you do, against <HI>Ecclesiasticks.</HI> What
need had you to talk of the Mischeifs
and Inconveniences of an Hireling Priest∣hood?
What occasion had you to call
them Ecclesiastical Virmin, and to speak
of the Happiness of Mankind upon their
Extinction? These things are very pro∣voking.
And here's the true Sourse, in
my Opinion, of all your Troubles!</P>
<P>Tho I have here shewn, that <HI>Christ is
not risen,</HI> yet I have more Wit than to
make the Inference of <HI>Paul,</HI> that <HI>their
Preaching is vain.</HI> Their Oratory is
still useful, if it be but to tickle the Ears
and amuse the Understandings of the Peo∣ple
about Doctrines they understand not,
whether true or false. And such an
order of Men, as are your Priestood, are,
by their Habit of long Robes, an Orna∣ment
to Society; and it is an Honour to
the Country to have them well fed and
clad. Had I Room for it, I could write a
curious <HI>Encomium</HI> in Prise of them, and
tell the World of what Use and Advan∣tage,
they have been, in all Ages. O
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
what Wars and Persecutions might have
been rais'd in the World, but for their
pacifick Tempers! How would Sin and
Immorality have broke in upon Man∣kind,
like a Deluge, but for the Goodness
of their Lives and the Excellency of their
Precepts! How has the Increase and Mul∣titude
of their warm Sermons been the
Ruin of <HI>Satan</HI>'s hot and divided Kingdom
of Darkness and Error! Its owing to
their Pains and Labours, that every Age,
for many past, has been improving in Vir∣tue,
till the present, which for Piety and
good Morals is that Perfection of Time,
which is not to be meliorated but by the
Restitution of the golden Age.</P>
<P>So could I enlarge in Praise of your
<HI>Clergy</HI>; and so should you have done;
and then you might have disputed, as
you do, against any Doctrines, Miracles
and Articles of Faith, without Molesta∣tion.
Try, if you can't correct that fun∣damental
Error, you have committed.
Assert still, if you can, with Dr. <HI>Rogers</HI>
the Necessity of an establish'd Priesthood,
well paid, for the Service of the <HI>King</HI> and
the Country, under all Changes of Reli∣gion;
which may be a means to retrieve
their Favour, and will beget in me a
better opinion of your Prudence, than at

<CLOSER><SIGNED>N. N.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>So ends the Letter of my Friend, the
<HI>Jewish Rabbi,</HI> in which to my Comfort,
he has conform'd himself to the Rules of
<HI>Sedateness, Decency</HI> and <HI>Sobriety</HI> of Argu∣ment,
prescrib'd by the two great <HI>Bishops</HI>
of <HI>London</HI> and St. <HI>Davids.</HI> If the weight
and solidity of his Argument don't grieve
the <HI>Clergy,</HI> I am in no Pain for the Levity
and Ludicrousness of if. And whether
the weight and nature of his Argument
against <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection will at all
startle and surprise them, I know not;
but I profess for my self, that I might
have study'd long enough for such an
Argument against it, as this <HI>Rabbi,</HI> with
his great gray Beard, has presently hit off.
He told me beforehand, that his Thoughts
on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection should be out of
the common Road of thinking; and I
must needs say, he has been as good as
his Word, or no Man ever kept his Pro∣mise.</P>
<P>There are two Things very remark∣able
in his Argument: The <HI>One</HI> is, the
Use and Design of sealing the Stone of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Sepulchre, which he lays great
stress on, to the Proof of Fraud in his
Resurrection; and the <HI>other</HI> is, his Appli∣cation
of these Words, <HI>the last Error</HI> (or
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
as he reads Deceit or Imposture) <HI>will be
worst than the first</HI> or former, in which
he makes the <HI>Cheif Priests</HI> in their Speech
to <HI>Pilat,</HI> to refer to <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrec∣rection
as the former known Imposture.
If his Application be just and true, the
Consequence is that the Resurrections of
<HI>Jesus</HI> and <HI>Lazarus</HI> are both Impostures.
It grieves me to the Heart to think of
this Consequence, which our <HI>Divines</HI> are
to see to, and evade, if they can. No
sooner did I read his Application of the
foresaid Words, but I run to our <HI>Commen∣tators</HI>
for another and better Exposition of
them: But alas! to my Sorrow, they
made nothing of them, but a sort of a
<HI>proverbial Expression,</HI> which the <HI>Cheif
Priests</HI> must have spoil'd and knock'd out
of Joint. Being then under great Trou∣ble
for the Truth of Christianity and the
Certainty of these two grand Miracles,
I refer the matter to our Learned <HI>Clergy,</HI>
desiring them to be as speedy as they
can in another and more proper Inter∣pretation
of the foresaid Words, or <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Infidels</HI> will run away with them
in the <HI>Rabbi</HI>'s Sense, to the Confutation
of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>I consider'd lately, tint <HI>Easter</HI> drew
nigh, when it was usual for our <HI>Divines</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
in their Pulpits, to insist on the Proof of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection; and therefore I
I hasten'd the Publication of this <HI>Dis∣course,</HI>
that they might have these two
peculiar Texts, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>sealing the Stone</HI>
of the Sepulchre, and of <HI>the last Error</HI> or
Imposture <HI>will be worse than the first,</HI> to
treat on. He that produces a Sermon or
Sermons, wresting the foresaid Texts out
of the Hands of my <HI>Rabbi,</HI> and putting
another Sense on them, to the Credit of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s and <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection,
<Q>Erit mihi magnus Apollo</Q>
and by my Consent shall be the next
<HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>But my Heart akes a little for our <HI>Di∣vines,</HI>
and I almost despair of their clean
Solutions of the foresaid two Difficultys.
What must they do then? Why, they
must give up their <HI>Religion</HI> as well as
their <HI>Church,</HI> or go along with me to
Fathers for their mystical Interpretation
of the whole Story of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrec∣tion.</P>
<P>That the Fathers, without questioning
their Belief of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s corporal Resur∣rection,
universally interpreted the Sto∣ry
and every part of it mystically, is
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
most certain.

<P>The Day would fail me to collect all
the Passages out of the Fathers, in Inter∣pretation
of one or other of the Parts
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
of the story of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection, but
what I have here said in a few Citations,
is enough to show, that they look'd upon
the whole Story, as emblematical of his
spiritual Resurrection out of the <HI>Grave</HI>
of the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Scriptures, in which
he has been bury'd about <HI>three Days</HI> and
<HI>three Nights,</HI> according to that mystical
Interpretation of prophetical Numbers
which I have learn'd of them.</P>
<P>And thus have I done with the Mira∣cle
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Resurrection, which, by
the help of my Friend the Jewish <HI>Rabbi,</HI>
I have shown, according to the Letter, to
consist of the greatest Incredibilitys. And
with this I conclude my <HI>Discourses</HI> on
his Miracles, intending to treat on no
more of them, unless I am invited or pro∣voked
to it. I had once an Inclination
to make another <HI>Discourse</HI> on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
miraculous Conception, and on his feeding
his Thousands, in the Wilderness with a
few Loaves and Fishes; but upon a little
Consideration on the Letter of those two
Storys, I found myself too grave for the
Work; and my <HI>Rabbi</HI>'s Thoughts are too
gay and wonton; therefore it must be
omitted, till the <HI>Clergy</HI> importune me to
it, and signify their Curiosity to see it
perform'd by me.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="58"/>
My Discourses hereafter, if God spare
me Life and Liberty, which under his
Providence I don't despair of, to pub∣lish
another Volume, shall treat on some
historical Passages of the New Testament,
such as, "On the Storys of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Birth;
and the Appearances of Angels to the
Shepherds keeping Watch over their Flocks
by Night; "The Journey and Presents of
the Wise Men to <HI>Jesus</HI>; The Slaughter
of the Innocents at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and of
<HI>Herods</HI> Cruelty; "The Travels of <HI>Joseph</HI>
with the Child <HI>Jesus</HI> and his Mother in∣to
<HI>Egypt</HI>; "The Disputation of <HI>Jesus</HI>
with the <HI>Doctors</HI> in the Temple, and
his Elopement from his Parents; "His
riding on an Ass to <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; and on
other such like Passages of his Life. For
I am resolv'd to give the Letter of the
Scripture no Rest, so long as God gives me
Life and Abilities to attack it. <HI>Origen</HI>
 <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Cum disputamus adversus eos, &amp; cum conquiri∣mus advicem, tunc quaeimus logum Dogmatis illius in littera Legis Historiae, &amp; ostenditur secundum His∣toriam stare non posse. <HI>In Psal.</HI> xxxvi</NOTE> says that <HI>when we dispute against
Ministers of the Letter, we must select
some historical Parts of Scripture, which
they understand litterally, and shew that
according to the Letter, they can't stand</HI><PB N="50" REF="59"/>
<HI>their Ground, but imply Absurditys and
Nonsence.</HI> And how then is such a Work
to be perform'd to best Advantage? is it
to be done in a grave, sedate, and serious
Manner? No, I think Ridicule should
here take Place of sober Reasoning, as
the more proper and effectual means to
cure Men of their foolish Faith and ab∣surd
Notions. As no wise Man hardly
ever reprehends a Blunderbuss for his
Bull, any other way, than by laughing
at him; so the Asserters of nonsensical
Notions in Theology should, if possible,
be satirised and jested upon, or they'll
never be put out of Countenance for,
nor desert their absurd Doctrines. And
there never was a Polemical Divine, that,
if he hid an opportunity and Advantage
over the Weakness of his Adversary, did
not take such a ludicrous and merry Course
with him.</P>
<P>But on such historical Passages of the
Gospel as before mention'd, do I trust to
publish another Volume of <HI>Discourses,</HI> like
to these on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles; and at pre∣sent
pass to my third general Head, at first
proposed to be spoken to, and that is,</P>
<P>III. To consider, what <HI>Jesus</HI> means,
when he appeals to his Works and Miracles,
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
as to a Testimony and witness of his Au∣thority;
and to show that he did not pro∣perly
and ultimately refer to those done in
the <HI>Flesh,</HI> but to those mystical ones he would
do in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> of which those done in
the Flesh are but mere Types and Sha∣dows.</P>
<P>And on this Head I shall be short, there
being no Occasion of many Words on it.
The <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Pastoral Letter, p. 25.</NOTE> has collected,
many Sayings of <HI>Jesus</HI> wherein he seems
to appeal to the Works he then did and had
done in Flesh, as to a witness of him. But
why might not <HI>Jesus</HI> then Prophesy, and
mean the spiritual Works which <HI>He-in-us</HI>
would do? It is the known Way of the
Prophets to speak of Things to come, as if
they were already past, because such Pro∣phecys
are not to be understood, till their
Accomplishment: Even so did <HI>Jesus</HI> Pro∣phesy,
when he appeal'd to his Works as
I could prove from the Nature and Man∣ner
of his Expressions, but that the Argu∣ment
would be dry and tedious; And there∣fore
I refer the Matter entirely to the Fa∣thers,
who asserted that <HI>Jesus</HI> prophesied
in his <HI>Miracles</HI> as well as in his <HI>Parables,</HI>
and that the Works, he then did in the Flesh
were but Types of his mysterious Operati∣ons,
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
that would be the Demonstration of
his Authority and Messiahship. Hence it
is that <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Adventus quidem Christi unus in Humilitate com∣pletus est, alius vero Speratur in Gloria. Et hic primus Adventus in Carne, mystico quodam Sermone in Scripturis Sanctis Umbra ejus appellatur. <HI>In Jesu Nave Homil.</HI> viii.</NOTE> says that <HI>Jesus</HI>'s first
coming was but Type and Shadow of his
Spiritual Advent; and that his <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Vera Christi Miracula &amp; Sanatio Infirmorum est spiritalis. <HI>In Matt. C.</HI> xxv.</NOTE> true Miracles, by which his Authority is to be
proved, are Spiritual: Hence it is that St.

Christi Gesta aliud portendunt. <HI>C.</HI> xii. <HI>S.</HI> 1. Peragunt formam futuri gesta praerfentia. <HI>C. </HI>x xi.</NOTE> that <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Works were significative and predictive of
mysterious Operations, which we were es∣pecially
to look to. And Hence it is that
all the other Fathers interpreted the Mira∣cles
of <HI>Jesus</HI> in a mystical and allegorical
Sense.</P>
<P>The Question then is, to what Miracles
did <HI>Jesus</HI> truly and properly appeal, in
the Opinion of the Fathers, for his Autho∣rity
and Messiahship? Was it to his Typi∣cal
or Antitypal Works? was it to the <HI>sha∣dow</HI>
or to the <HI>subsistance</HI> of his Operations?
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
To his substantial Operations, to be sure,
which are and will be his spiritual ones
upon the Soul that are greater than
those once done on Men's Bodys, and which
will be a proper Proof of his divine Power.
And to declare my Opinion freely I am,
only for such a spiritual <HI>Messiah,</HI> who will
cure the <HI>Errors</HI> call'd the Diseases of Man∣kind,
which <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI> has not as
yet done.</P>
<P>But not to dispute this Point with <HI>Bi∣shop
Gibson,</HI> I will leave him in the Enjoy∣ment
of his Opinion of his literal <HI>Messiah</HI>
and miraculous Operator on Men's Bodys;
if he'll but indulge me in the Belief of my
spiritual <HI>Messiah</HI> to come for the healing of
modern Distempers call'd the Sins and Er∣rors
of Mankind. And in the mean time
let us draw the Comparison between his
<HI>litteral</HI> and my <HI>spiritual</HI> Jesus; and let
the World judge, to whom the Preference
is to be given for Power and Authority,</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> is for <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Naza∣reth</HI>'s
Messiahship, because he cured the
<HI>bodily blindness</HI> of many miraculously;
And a good Work it was: But I am for
the Messiahship of a spiritual <HI>Jesus</HI> to
come, who will open the <HI>blind Eyes</HI> of
pur Understandings to discern Truth from
Error, which will be a most glorious
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
Operation; that his <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI>
has not as yet done.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> is for <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiahship,
who once cured <HI>bodily Deafness</HI> in many,
which was indeed well done of him: But
I am for the Messiahship of a spiritual
<HI>Jesus</HI> to come, to heal the <HI>Deafness</HI> of
our Souls or their <HI>Dulness</HI> in Apprehen∣sion
of sublime Mysterys, which will be
a divine Work, that his <HI>Jesus</HI> has not as
yet done.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> is for <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiahship,
because he cured Men's bodily <HI>Lameness,</HI>
for which I do praise him: But I am for
a spiritual <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiahship, who will
heal Mankind of their <HI>Halting</HI> between
two and more Opinions; a more Blessed
Work, that <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI> has not
as yet done for us !</P>
<P>And so, comparing all other Diseases of
Body and Soul together, I am for the
<HI>Jesus,</HI> who will heal the Diseases of the
Soul; and have a much less Regard for
<HI>Bishop Gibson</HI>'s <HI>Jesus</HI> who cured the Di∣seases
of a few Men's Bodys; but, for all
that, am not angry with the <HI>Bishop</HI> for his
high Veneration of his <HI>Jesus,</HI> neither
would I by any Means have him prose∣secuted
and punish'd for not being of the
same Mind with me.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="64"/>
But, because the <HI>Bishop</HI> suspects me of
Infidelity, in that I have ludicrously treat∣ed
some of the Miracles of his <HI>Jesus,</HI>
which, by the by, he has not vindicated
from the Absurditys and Incredibilitys I
charged them with; I will humour the
<HI>Bishop,</HI> and, supposing <HI>Jesus</HI> wrought li∣terally
those Miracles which are allegori∣cally
interpreted by me, will in those ve∣ry
Miracles compare his <HI>litteral</HI> and my
<HI>spiritual</HI> Jesus together; and appeal to all
Men of Consideration, which is the most
worthy of the Title and Honour of the
true <HI>Messiah.</HI></P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> is for his <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messi∣ahship,
who miraculously drove the <HI>Buyers</HI>
and <HI>Sellers</HI> out of the Temple, just as if
a Man, was God to invest him with
Power, should furiously drive the <HI>Butchers</HI>
and <HI>Grasiers</HI> with their Cattle, to the
Confusion of their several Propertys, out
of <HI>Smithfield</HI>: A notable Miracle That!
But I am for the spiritual <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiah∣ship
who according to the Form of that
typical Story, will at his Coming expel Ec∣clesiastical
Merchants out of his Church,
who make Merchandise of the Gospel,
Selling their <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Beasts</HI> and <HI>fat∣lings</HI>
of the Letter: A most glorious and
Beneficial Work to Mankind will this
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
be ! And to prepare Men's Souls for the
susception of such a spiritual <HI>Jesus,</HI> I
intend to publish a <HI>Discourse</HI> of the Mis∣chiefs
and Inconveniencies of an <HI>Hire∣ling-Priesthood,</HI>
wherein it shall be proved,
that Mankind can't be either good, wise
or happy under the Kingdom of this
<HI>Messiah</HI> to come, without an Abolition
and Extirpation of them.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> is for the Messiahship of
his <HI>Jesus,</HI> who <HI>cast the Devils out of the
Madmen, aud permitted them to enter into
the Herd of Swine,</HI> that <HI>ran violently down
a Precipice and were choak'd in the Sea</HI>:
How great a Miracle it was thus to cure
the Madmen, the <HI>Bishop</HI> may know best,
being perhaps better acquainted with
the Devil than I am; but was it not
for Pity to the <HI>Swineherds</HI> for their
Losses, I could even now laugh at the
Thoughts of the Hogs running and tumb∣ling
down-hill, as if the <HI>Devil</HI> drove
them: But leaving the Bishop <HI>calmly,</HI>
<HI>decently</HI> and <HI>seriously</HI> to admire the Wis∣dom
and Justice of his <HI>Jesus</HI> in that Act,
I am for the spiritual <HI>Jesus,</HI> who accord∣ing
to the typical form of that Story,
exorcis'd the furious and diabolical Tem∣pers
out of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> of old,
whom no Chains of Reason could hold
from doing Violence to the Christians,
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
till they were converted; and tho He per∣mitted
the like persecuting and diabolical.
Spirits to enter into Ecclesiastical Swine;
yet will they be precipitated into the <HI>Sea</HI>
of the Knowledge of God, wherein they
will be absorpt with divine Divisions and
Contemplations. O most glorious Work,
that bespeaks the Wisdom, Power and
Goodness of our spiritual <HI>Jesus</HI> from be∣ginning
to the End of it.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> admires his <HI>Jesus,</HI> for
his Transfiguration on Mount <HI>Tabor,</HI> tho
neither He nor any body else can tell,
wherein lay the Miracle, nor into what
various Figures and Shapes <HI>Jesus</HI> was
transform'd: But I am for the spiritual
<HI>Jesus,</HI> whose glorious Transfiguration, af∣ter
<HI>six</HI> grand Days of the Creation, will
be conspicuous, when with the Eyes of
our Understanding we shall behold him
metamorphosed into the Forms of all the
Types of him under the Law. I am now
ravish'd with the intellectual View of this
Transfiguration; and believe, was I to set a∣bout
it, I could give others (except the
Bishop) an Idea and Conception of it to
their Astonishment at the Glory of <HI>Jesus</HI>
in it.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> is for the Messiahship of
<HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> because he cured a
<HI>Woman of an Issue of Blood,</HI> after she had
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
spent all she had upon Physicians to no
purpose; which might be, or might not
be a Miracle, for any Thing he can argue
upon it: But I am for the spiritual <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Messiahship, who at his Coming
will, according to that Typical Story,
cure the <HI>Woman</HI> of the Church of her
<HI>Issue of Blood,</HI> that is shed in Persecution
and War, which her Ecclesiastical Phy∣sicians
of the <HI>Clergy</HI> have not been
able to stop tho they have receiv'd large
Fees and Stipends of the Church to that
Purpose. Will not this be a desirable and
beneficial Work to all Nations? And who
knows not, (excepting the <HI>Bishop</HI>) that it
is of the Office of the true Messiah, to
give <HI>abundance of Peace</HI> to Mankind, to
<HI>make the Lion to lye down with the Lamb</HI>;
and to induce Men to <HI>break their Swords
into Plow-shares,</HI> and <HI>their Spears into
Pruning-hooks</HI>; and to <HI>make Wars to cease</HI>
in all the World. Which Prophecys are so
far from being fulfill'd by <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Na∣zareth,</HI>
that there has been nothing but
wrangling and jangling and scolding and
fighting about him ever since. I wonder
the want of the Accomplishment of the
foresaid Prophecys has not long before now
occasion'd the Rejection of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiah∣ship,
or of the Authority of the Prophets.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="68"/>
Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> is for his <HI>Jesus</HI>'s being
the Messiah, because he cured an old
<HI>Woman</HI> of a <HI>Spirit</HI> of, no body knows
what, <HI>Infirmity</HI>; consequently little or
nothing is to be said for the Greatness of
that Miracle. But I am for the spiritual
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiahship, who, according to the
figure of that litteral Story, is to heal the
<HI>Woman</HI> of the Church of her <HI>Infirmity of
the Spirit</HI> of Prophecy, which <HI>Jesus</HI> of
<HI>Nazareth</HI> has not done for her, or there
would not be so many Disputes about
Prophecys and their Interpretations, so far,
as there is hardly one Prophecy that Chris∣tians
are agreed about the Sense of. It
is the grand Characteristick of the true
<HI>Messiah,</HI> that he's to restore Prophecy and
the Way of Interpretation of the Prophets,
upon the allegorical Scheme too. I speak
this, not only upon the Authority of the
Prophets themselves, but upon an almost
infinite number of Testimonys of ancient
<HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Fathers</HI>; accordingly I expect
the Advent of a spiritual Messiah, who
alone can do it, to heal the Church of
her present <HI>Infirmity,</HI> and to restore the
Art and Gift of Prophecy.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> is an Admirer of <HI>Jesus</HI>
of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> because he told a poor
Whore of <HI>Samaria,</HI> her Fortune of <HI>having
had five Husbands,</HI> and being then an
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
Adulteress with another Man; which ac∣cording
to the Letter is such a poor sort
of a Miracle, that I can hardly think of
it without blushing: But I am an Adorer
beforehand of the spiritual <HI>Jesus</HI> who,
according to that Type, will out of the
Law and the Prophets, allegorically inter∣preted,
tell the present heretical and adul∣terous
Woman of the Church <HI>all that she
has done.</HI> and how she has been wedded to
the sensible Things of the <HI>five</HI> Books of
<HI>Moses,</HI> and is now an Adulteress with the
<HI>Anti-Christ</HI> of the Letter. Such an In∣formation
of the Church will be a most
stupendous and miraculous Work, and a
Demonstration of our <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiahship
beyond Contradiction, in as much as it
will be agreeable to the Opinion, that all
Antiquity entertain'd of the true <HI>Messiah,</HI>
<HI>viz.</HI> that he was to let us into the Sight,
Knowledge and Understanding of the
Wisdom and Beauty of Providence thro'
all Ages of the World.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> admires <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Naza∣reth</HI>
for <HI>his cursing the Figtree</HI>; <HI>for not
bearing Fruit out of Season</HI>: Shame on
that Miracle, according to the Letter, and
on all Admirers of it! But I am for the
spiritual <HI>Jesus</HI> who at his Coming to the
Figtree of his Church will make its <HI>pre∣sent</HI>
unfruitful State to <HI>wither away,</HI> and
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
cause it to produce the Fruits of the Spi∣rit,
and allegorical Interpretations of the
Scriptures, that are compared so sweet and
ripe Figs. For such his Advent to this
miraculous and beneficial Purpose I daily
pray and say too, Blessed are all those who
love his Appearance!</P>
<P>After this Fashion could I go thro' the
other Miracles, I have treated on in these
<HI>Discourses</HI>; and Upon the Comparison set
plainly before the Eyes of my <HI>Readers</HI> the
Difference between the <HI>litteral</HI> Miracles of
Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI>'s <HI>carnal</HI> Jesus and the <HI>alle∣gorical</HI>
ones of my <HI>spiritual</HI> Jesus, as to
Stupendousness, Use and Excellency: But,
what I have here done in the seven Instances
above, is enough to induce us to believe,
with the Fathers, that <HI>Jesus</HI>'s first Coming
in the <HI>Flesh</HI> was but Type and Shadow of
his second Advent in the <HI>Spirit</HI>; and that
<HI>Jesus</HI> of old when he appeal'd to his
Works then done, as to a Witness of his
Authority, did only Prophesy, and re er∣ultimately
to his mystical Operations, that
are alone the Proof of his Godlike and
divine Power. Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> says <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">Pastoral Letter, p. 3.</NOTE>
of me, that <HI>pretending to raise the Ac∣tions
and Miracles of our Saviour to a
more exalted and spiritual Meaning, I</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="71"/><HI>have labour'd to take away the Reality
of them, and by that to destroy one of the
principal Evidences of Christianity.</HI> But
I presume now, he'll be sensible of the
Rashness and Incogitancy of that Accu∣sation.
If he be not, I shall say of him,
in Case he write any more for <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
<HI>litteral</HI> Miracles in Opposition to his
<HI>allegorical</HI> ones, that he's like the Dog
in the Fable (the <HI>Bishop</HI> will excuse the
Coarsness of the Comparison) that let go
the <HI>Substance</HI> of his Mutton, and catch'd
at the Shadow, and so, like a foolish
<HI>Cur</HI> as he was, lost both.</P>
<P>And thus have I done with the <HI>Three</HI>
general Heads at first proposed to be hand∣led
in these <HI>Discourses</HI> Now whether
I am, upon the whole, an <HI>Infidel</HI> or <HI>Be∣leiver</HI>
of Christianity, the World is to
judge. I'll make no more solemn Decla∣rations
of my Belief of it, much less at
this Juncture of Time, when I am under
Prosecution for Infidelity; because it
would be a sneaking, tame and cowardly
Act in me, and such an Argument of
that meanness of Spirit, as I abhor and
detest. My <HI>Works</HI> shall speak for me, in
which being, conscious of the Innocency
of my Intentions, and of the Usefulness
of my Design, I mean to proceed; not
doubting but some of our <HI>Clergy,</HI> upon
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
two or three more <HI>Discourses</HI> against the
Letter of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> will find
me out, what I am, and whether I am
not a true Professor of the Religion of the
spiritual and holy <HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, I'll not compound
the Difference depending between Bishop
<HI>Gibson</HI> and myself, upon any other Terms,
than his making me ample Satisfaction
for the Injurys done to my Reputation
and low Fortunes. Tho he may thirst
after my Life, or at least, my Liberty;
yet under the Providence of God I fear
not the Loss of either. God be prais'd,
this Kingdom is bless'd with such a
Civil Administration for Wisdom, Justice
and Mercy as no Nation of the World
can equal. Our Magistrates are all Phi∣losophers,
Lovers of Truth, and of an
Enquiry into it; and so tender of the
religious as well as of the civil Rights of
the Subject, that I have nothing to dread
from them.</P>
<P>There is somewhat <HI>popular</HI> indeed, tho
nothing true nor rational, in the Clamour
and Accusations of the <HI>Clergy</HI> against me.
Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> would insinuate <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Pastoral Letter, p. 35.</NOTE> that
my <HI>Discourses</HI> on <HI>Miracles</HI> strike <HI>at the
Foundation of civil Society</HI>; but by an un∣natural
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
Consequence of his own making.
I confess, it is an heinous Crime to write
any Thing, that tends to the Subversion or
Prejudice of the civil Society: But how
will the <HI>Bishop</HI> make me guilty of it? If
the <HI>Clergy</HI> will not be Disturbers of the
Peace of the publick upon my <HI>Discourses</HI>;
it's certain, that the Quiet of the World,
which I wish and aim at, will be inviolably
kept and preserv'd for all me. My Fol∣lowers
indeed, when I walk the Streets of
this <HI>City,</HI> are <HI>numerous</HI>; and if any of them
should break the Peace, what serves my
<HI>Lord Mayor</HI>'s Power for, but to chastise
them for it? As for my self and my Adhe∣rents
at home which as yet are <HI>without
Number,</HI> we are all <HI>Quietists</HI> and should act
against our Consciences and Religion, if we
should injure any Man in his Person and
Property. But I smile to see a <HI>Clergyman</HI>
all on a sudden, like the <HI>Bishop,</HI> so tender
of the Welfare of the Publick, when <HI>Eccle∣siasticks,</HI>
in all Ages past, have been the
<HI>Bane</HI> of Society and the <HI>Pest</HI> of Mankind,
as appears from the Wars and Persecu∣tions,
they have rais'd in the World; and
from that Strife, Variance and Discords,
they have occasion'd in Citys and Familys.
And with Submission to the <HI>Bishop,</HI> who
I hope will not be angry for my saying
it, I am sure, the <HI>Clergy</HI> at this Juncture,
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
even darken'd and obscured the seemingly
native simplicity of the Story of the Life
of Jesus. So leaving you to chew upon this,
I turn</P>
<P>My Address to <HI>Infidels,</HI> particularly to
the two most renown'd Writers of the
Party, Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI> and Mr. <HI>Scheme.</HI> I
should, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> by Right salute you
with the Title of <HI>Free-Thinkers,</HI> a proper
Name for your Philosophical Sect, who
are for the free Exercise of your Reason
about divine and speculative Points in
Theology. And I had distinguish'd you
by this Title from your Apostatical Ad∣versarys,
but that I had a Mind to ob∣lige
my old Friends the <HI>Clergy</HI> in giving
you a no more honourable Title than I
do them. And I trust you will not be
offended at the Title of <HI>Infidels,</HI> since not
only your Writings seem to have a Ten∣dency
to Infidelity; but, if there be any
Fault in your Principles, you know how
to charge it on your Adversarys, the pre∣tended
Advocates for Christianity, whose
Absurditys, false Reasonings. Inconsisten∣cys,
and foolish Glosses on the Scriptures
have occasion'd your departure from the
Faith in Christ.</P>
<P>I thank Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> for the noble Pre∣sent
of his Book, which I received and
read with Pleasure. But instead of one,
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
he should have sent me a <HI>Dozen</HI> for the
Use of Friends and Borrowers, who are
very curious and importunate for the Per∣usal
of it. For what Reason He envys
the <HI>Booksellers</HI> the publick Sale of his Work,
chusing rather to give it away <HI>gratis,</HI> than
that they should reap any Profit by it,
I know not. Surely it is not to bring
an <HI>Odium</HI> on the <HI>Clergy</HI> for Persecutors,
as if such an useful and philosophical
Piece might not appear publickly without
danger from them: If so, I hope the
<HI>Clergy</HI> will resent the Indignity, and invite
him to a Publication of his Book, with
a Promise of Impunity, which would
wipe off the Reproach, which this clan∣destine
Method of disposing of it has cast
on them.</P>
<P>I once almost despair'd, <HI>Sirs,</HI> of seeing
such another Piece from your Quarter. I
was afraid the Prosecution of the <HI>Moderator</HI>
would have deterr'd you from the Press,
whereby our excellent Controversy on Foot
must have been drop't: But the sudden and
unexpected appearance of Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> has
revived me, and rejoiced the Cockles of my
Heart. Go on then, <HI>Great Sirs,</HI> in this
Controversy, which Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI> happily
commenc'd, and if you are deny'd the Li∣berty
of the Press, and publick Sale of your
Books, I hope you'll, for all that, as occasi∣on
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
offers it self, oblige the Learned and Cu∣rious
with some more of your bright Lucu∣brations,
tho' you Print them, and dispose
of them in this clancular and subtile Me∣thod.</P>
<P>It is not that I wish well to your Cause
of Infidelity, that I thus encourage you.
You have more Sense and Reason than to
suspect me tainted with unbelieving Prin∣ciples.
Christianity will stand its Ground
against your battering Armour; and the
Church of Christ will be the more firmly
establish'd on a Rock of Wisdom, for that
Opposition you make to it. Tho' you will
entirely vanquish the litteral <HI>Schemists,</HI>
and ride in Triumph over them; yet o∣ther
Defenders of the Faith, call'd <HI>Allego∣rists,</HI>
will arise to your Confutation and
final overthrow.</P>
<P>If I am not mistaken, <HI>Sirs,</HI> your Ad∣versarys,
the litteral <HI>Schemists,</HI> whom I
call <HI>Apostates,</HI> are about making a Retreat,
and yeilding the Field of Battle to you.
The <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> the greatest Ge∣neral
on their Side, will not only find it
hard to levy any more Forces in Defence
of his <HI>twelve</HI> litteral Prophecys; but he
knows, that, if he draw his Sword any
more against you, he must attack too the
Authority of the Fathers for the allego∣rical
Interpretation of some of those Pro∣phecys,
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
already urg'd in my <HI>Supplements</HI> to
the <HI>Moderator</HI>; or, if the Fathers are
neglected by him; they and I, keeping out
of the Reach of his <HI>Bug-Pear,</HI> will treat
him with such familiar Language, as never
was given to one of his Order.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> seems to promise us a Dis∣course
on the Miracles in the Scriptures,
I hope he'll be as good as his Word, and
'ere long publish it. This Discourse of
mine can't possibly supersede his. As I
question not, but his Thoughts and Re∣marks
on Miracles will be very conside∣rable;
so I shall be a little impatient till
I see them. But be his Discourse on Mi∣racles
of what Kind soever, I believe it
will hardly be an Obstruction to my Un∣dertaking
in Hand, which I intend, by
Gods Leave, to go on with, to the Ho∣nour
of the Holy <HI>Jesus,</HI> our Spiritual <HI>Me∣siah,</HI> to
whom be Glory and Praise for
ever and ever. Amen.</P>
