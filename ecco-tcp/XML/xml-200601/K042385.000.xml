<HEAD>A
LETTER
TO THE
Writer of a Letter to my Lord <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Occasion'd
by a Letter to the Publisher of
the present Edition of the <HI>Dunciad Vario∣rum.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> has now oblig'd himself, and is
perfectly happy in beholding his illustrious Brat, the just Sem∣blance
of his sweet temper'd Parent, make his Appearance:
He had long promis'd, or rather threaten'd the Publick with this Edi∣tion;
but Nobody would believe, that any Creature could be hardy,
or vain, or wicked enough, to undertake to utter a virulent Lampoon,
with the Names of many worthy Persons at full Length; but it seems,
the Raneour of his Mind has got the better of his Fears, and the Itch
of Scribling is much superior to the Dread of Chastisement.</P>
<P>Well then, having (like <HI>Caesar</HI>) written his own Commentaries, and
given himself various Readings upon himself, having guarded himself
on all Sides, and surrounded his Text with <HI>Prolegomena, Testimonia,</HI>
<HI>Arguments, Indexes, Appendix, &amp;c.</HI> and adorn'd himself with all the
Pomp and Trappings that usually attend the Dignity of an establish'd
Writer of Antiquity: Behold him strutting into the World, and ex∣pecting
to receive the Reverence due to his Quality, <HI>Optat Ephippia Mus,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
and however awkardly they become him, he rejoices in them. Behold
him now proclaiming himself a Classick; behold a Personage whom he
stiles <HI>William Cleland,</HI> walking gravely before our Poetical Dictator, bare
Headed, with the Fasces on his Shoulder; and a little behind him, an
ugly Northern Thing, formerly his Colleague in Scandal and Criticism,
an odd Mixture of <HI>Doctor, Poet, Buffoon, Punster, Politician, Antiqua∣ry,</HI>
and <HI>Cook</HI>; methinks I see them now marching in solemn Parade,
round the new created Classick's Garden at <HI>Twickenham</HI>; I hear them
repeating the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and the neighbouring Shores resound his Verses.</P>
<P>Yet has not the Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>'s Vanity outrun his Judgment
so many Lengths, to persuade him to set his own Name to this modest
Performance; therefore has he borrow'd, and very properly, the Name
of <HI>Martinus Scriblerus</HI>; and not content with this, or apprehensive this
was not a sufficient Protection for him, he has publish'd a Letter to his
Publisher, and sign'd it <HI>William Cleland.</HI></P>
<P>I have many Reasons which induce me to believe, that this Friend
of <HI>Scriblerus</HI>'s, whom he calls <HI>William Cleland,</HI> is a counterfeit Friend
only, and the Words stand like <HI>Richard Roe,</HI> and <HI>John Doe,</HI> for Form
Sake only, in a Recovery, and to give the Modest Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>
an Opportunity of saying something pretty in his own Favour. Mr.
<HI>Congreve,</HI> in his <HI>Way of the World,</HI> shews us a Coxcomb, who used to
enquire for himself at a Chocolate-house, and not finding himself there,
would leave Letters for himself: But our little merry Author goes far∣ther;
he prints Letters to himself, writes Libels, threatens, forgives,
punishes, and is really the <HI>Drawcansir</HI> of the Age.</P>
<P>In the Publisher's Preface, (for <HI>our Classick</HI> gives us a Publisher's Pre∣face,
as well as a Preface to the Publisher) he takes upon him to an∣swer
for Posterity, and very modestly assures us, that this insipid Poem
will be read by Posterity: These are his Words, <HI>In this Monument they must
expect to survive</HI> (<HI>And here survive they shall,</HI> (Oh dreadful!) <HI>as long as
the</HI> English <HI>Tongue shall remain such as it was in the Reigns of Queen</HI> Anne
<HI>and King</HI> George.) If this Pigmy Animal's Wit could come up to his
Malice, what Work would he make with those who should be so unhappy
to fall under his Displeasure! But as it is, if this Monument, as he calls
it, should last; let the present Age inform him, and hereby it does in∣form
him, that it will stand only as a Monument of his Infamy; and
those that come after us will and must believe, the Persons who stood
the Marks of his petulant Malice, to be Worthy and Good Men; and
the Enemies of the Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> will be always look'd
upon as the Friends of Virtue; they will see a little invidious narrow
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
Mind in every Line he has written; they will blush at his indecent
Idaeas, and be shock'd at his Scurrility. Therefore I applaud your Design,
Sir, of printing your Letter in Quarto, exactly on the same Size with
that of the <HI>Dunciad Variorum</HI>; let it be bound up with it; let them
cling together through every Age; there the Author of the <HI>Dunciad
shall survive, and survive he shall — As long as the</HI> English <HI>Tongue
shall remain such as it was in the Reigns of Queen</HI> Anne, <HI>and King</HI> George.
If this should be the Case, What Courage, what Allies, what Stature
must future Ages conceive this Giant Warriour to be aided with? They
will imagine him at least to be Seven Foot high, beyond the Growth
of his Cotemporaries, both in Stature and Understanding. Will they
not be surprized, when I assure them, and I do hereby assure them, (for
I, Sir, put in my Claim to Immortality too, by being annexed to you)
that this same Gyant, was but about four Foot and an Half high, of a
Structure a little irregular, and his Genius Low and indecent as his
Form.</P>
<P>But I lose my Purpose, which was to shew the Improbability that any
Man should be so weak or unadvis'd, or hungry after any Sort of Fame
to so mean a Degree, to place, or suffer his Name to be placed before a
leud and infamous Libel; therefore I say, This same Author has written
a Letter to himself in the Name of one <HI>William Cleland,</HI> and made him
to commend and applaud the Author, for what every one knows he
is liable by the Laws of the Land to be punish'd when he shall
be discovered; and for this Cause, at the same Time that he has plac'd
every Gentleman's Name whom he has abused at full Length, he has not
dared to subscribe his own.</P>
<P>It is usual for the Merry Andrew after he has play'd over his arch
Tricks for some Time, to put on a grave Face, to rectify his Muscles,
and to harangue his Audience in a more sober Wise, to prepare them to
receive the Doctor with Respect; and this is always done in a prefatory
Way, before the Doctor produces his Medals, or his Pacquets, or pro∣ceeds
to poison himself or the Company. Our Doctor of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>
has thought it proper, it seems, that somebody should for Form sake take
upon him this Character; and if he has not made his supposed Friend
to rise to the Dignity of his <HI>Zany,</HI> he may at least be allowed to
be the Vinegar of the Ring, and be qualified to whip the People into
a Circle before the Sports begin. As the Character of this <HI>W. C.</HI>
thus drawn by the Libeller, is of a very uncommon Kind, I will
give it you in some Observations upon this merry Letter of the
Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> in the Name of this <HI>W. C.</HI> to the Publisher
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>; that is, to Nobody, it having been never publickly
sold when he wrote his Letter: So that here is one <HI>W. C.</HI> whom
Nobody ever heard of, writing to a certain Publisher, whom No∣body
knew.</P>
<P>This same Author says, in the Name of <HI>W. C.</HI> that it was a
Mark of his Humanity to stay so long before he executed his Vengeance
upon those who had offended him: Now, as Nobody knows better
than he, the Strength and Bitterness of his own Gall, Nobody can
assure us so well as he, how long Malice will keep alive, fifteen or
twenty Years at least it seems; but now as this Humanity of his
(as he is pleas'd to call it) would be a very dangerous Plea at the
<HI>Old Baily</HI> in an Indictment for the destroying a Man's Person, I
think it should weigh as little with the Candid, in justifying the De∣struction
of a Man's Reputation.</P>
<P>But he makes his <HI>William Cleland</HI> a Party to his Crime likewise,
and declares he assisted in composing the Libel: He makes him
affirm, he was obliged to it in Humanity, for, says he, very gravely,
<HI>It was an Orphan</HI>; an <HI>Orphan</HI> Libel. Libels are all Orphans, dear
<HI>William Cleland,</HI> a Sort of Children whom their Fathers never care
to own, and though your Humanity may be very great, I think
in this Case your Prudence will hardly weight against it; there are
very good Reasons why this same Author does not own his Child;
and if you knew or consider'd them, sure you would not thrust
your Ears into the Dispute; but I forget that this <HI>W. C.</HI> is only
an <HI>Ens Rationis,</HI> a Man of Straw, set up by the candid Author of
the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> to combat for him.</P>
<P>Immediately after this, our Libeller forgot what he just before af∣firm'd,
and makes this very <HI>W. C.</HI> to say, He has found out the
Father of the Bastard; he makes him most impudently to declare
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to be the Author: If he means, as I hope he does not,
the Poet of that Name, who has been so much oblig'd by the Pub∣lick,
who is, or ought to be by his Education, a Gentleman, whom
Books ought to have taught Humanity, and polite Conversation and
Letters, Decency and good Manners; what does this infamous Au∣thor
deserve for making his <HI>W. C.</HI> abuse him in this Manner. But
the Reasons he gives why he conceives Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to be the Author, are
equally scurrilous and ridiculous. <HI>Every one was curious</HI> (says he) <HI>to read
what could be said to prove Mr.</HI> Pope <HI>a Dunce, and was ready to pay
something for such a Discovery.</HI> How came he to imagine every one
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> curious to find this Gentleman a Dunce; if he knows him to be
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
the Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> every Man of common Sense may easily
judge what he is; but as the Person who has written that low and in∣famous
Satyr, has not yet dared to set his own Name before it, I
think it did not become this same <HI>W. C.</HI> whoever he is, to do it for
him. If <HI>W. C.</HI> was a real and not a feign'd Person, I do not doubt
but Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would do himself Justice for this Abuse, and recur to the
Laws for Satisfaction upon him.</P>
<P>But this Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> whoever he is must be a plea∣sant
Fellow, for he goes on, and makes his Man of Straw, <HI>W. C.</HI>
declare, that when he saw Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> attack'd or written against, or
answer'd by those who were abused (for he will have him to be his
Author still) that he thought it was become a common Cause; <HI>the
Danger was common to all, and his Concern ought to be so too</HI>; and
he causes him very seriously to deliver it as his Opinion, That those
who <HI>attack'd Mr.</HI> Pope, <HI>must be Traitors to Church and State, and Wo∣men,</HI>
(strange Stuff) a little venemous Wretch, not Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> is lash'd
for his Ribaldry and his ill Nature; and this Author makes one
<HI>W. C.</HI> without any other Proof but his bare Word, to declare,
<HI>That they have insulted the Fallen, the Friendless, the Exil'd, and the
Dead.</HI> It is plain, he would in this Place put his <HI>W. C.</HI> upon us for
one not well affected to our present Establishment. It is very well
there is no such Person as this <HI>W. C.</HI> If there should be such a
one, and he should have a Place under the Government, what Cha∣stisement
would not this low Author merit, for putting these Words
into his Mouth. We do very well know some People have <HI>fallen</HI>
in the unhappy Divisions of our Country (as he gently terms the late
unnatural Rebellion) some <HI>are Friendless, some Exil'd,</HI> and <HI>others Dead,</HI>
and therefore, those who have written against these People, must bear
the Lash of our Author's Satyr; if it be true that they have insulted
these People, let our Author remember, that they first insulted their
Country and its Laws.</P>
<P>This same Friend of his goes on, and does now discover some Fears
that hang about him, least he should be taken for a Fool or a Knave, by
keeping Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Company; though it luckily happens, that his wri∣ting
this Letter has determined his Character; yet he very judiciously
conceives, it was his Duty to vindicate him in Print from all Calum∣ny,
or to be deemed either the One or the Other; so that ac∣cording
to this Notion, all the Acquaintance of Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> are oblig'd
to Print in his Vindication, or to be esteemed Fools or Knaves: Here
the Author puts forth his whole Head.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="11"/>
This can only be the over-weening Conceit of a Self-sufficient Writer;
an assuming spurious Classick, asserting his Supremacy, and demanding
Obedience, as you will see; for immediately after this, he affects the
Regal Stile; he causes his <HI>W. C.</HI> to proclaim his Royalty, and ac∣cordingly
he issues his Edicts, That all Offenders against <HI>him shall be
chastised</HI>: He likens <HI>them</HI> to <HI>Assassins</HI>; he says, <HI>Poverty shall not be any
Excuse,</HI> nor <HI>to be pleaded before</HI> him, no more than <HI>at the Old Baily,</HI>
neither shall they, says he, receive <HI>the Benefit of the Clergy.</HI> But
some Time after this, his Majesty cools, he is graciously pleas'd to
shew Mercy, and he makes his Herald <HI>W. C.</HI> to grant his <HI>Dunces
a little Bread, and a little Fame.</HI> How ridiculous is it, to see a di∣minutive
strutting Thing, erecting himself into a Mock-Sovereign:
A modest <HI>Homuncio,</HI> who at the same Time that he privately assas∣sinates,
calls those whom he wounds, Assassins? But let us consider
this Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> as he really is, a Person Poetically mad,
jealous of Fame, and envious of every Rival, grasping at the smallest
Shadow of Reputation, all his Attention fix'd to one Point, raving
after imaginary Honours, and seeking Infamy in Fame, and we shall
incline to Pity rather than Censure. This throws into ones Mind the
Situation of the Mad Taylor in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> who called himself <HI>Alexan∣der
the Great,</HI> was gracious, and bountiful, and just, and cruel, and victo∣rious,
and good, and bad, as those Ideas struck his sick Brain.</P>
<P>By this Time, Sir, you may imagine, I am not a little weary of
raking into this Heap of Nonsense and Vanity now before me; but as
I now cast my Eye forward, I can't help observing upon this ima∣ginary
Letter Writer, where he tells us, <HI>The Author of the</HI> Dunciad
<HI>has a Contempt for the Writings of those he has written against</HI>:
This is not at all unlikely; One very seldom has a good Opinion
of those whom one has an ill Opinion of; <HI>but they are Dunces,
and should be abused for pretending to Wit</HI>: If this be the Case, nei∣ther
the Great <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> nor <HI>W. C.</HI> nor Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> himself, are exempt
from the Lash of Satyr; for Great, Dignify'd, Letter'd, as they
are, somebody may Print and declare them Dunces, and attempt to
displace this Stupendous Magistrate and all his mad Ministry, who
usurp the Throne of Wit. What a very <HI>Scanderberg</HI> of an Author is
this!</P>
<P><HI>W. C.</HI> I mean the Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> in his Name, goes on
and compares <HI>Boileau</HI> to himself: What has the Great <HI>Boileau</HI> done,
to deserve to be compared with an insignificant Ribald? But as he is
now concluding his elegant Epistle, he makes <HI>W. C.</HI> as is usual in the
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
Beginning of a new Reign, to publish an Act of Grace, and Mercy
is offered to those who shall repent and merit it: These are his
Royal Words by <HI>W. C. If ever He</HI> (the Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>) <HI>shall give
us an Edition of this Poem himself, I may see some of them treated as
gently</HI> (<HI>on their Repentance and better Mind</HI>) <HI>as</HI> Perault <HI>and</HI> Quinault
<HI>were at last by</HI> Boileau.</P>
<P>This little bouncing mock Emperor concludes in the Name of <HI>W. C.</HI>
with this singular Observation on Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>'s Modesty, <HI>that he never
wrote a Line, that he was ever asham'd or unwilling to own.</HI> Now, I
think it is impossible any Person but Mr. <HI>P.</HI> himself can be assur'd of
this, at least, nobody but Mr. <HI>P.</HI> can know that Mr. <HI>P.</HI> has no manner of
Grace, or Modesty, or Morals; and he must be a very Blunderer of a
Letter-Writer, who could venture to assure the Publick so, and in the
Name of one, who pretends to be ambitious of being call'd his Friend.</P>
<P>If now, Sir, after all the Reasons I have given to the contrary, this
<HI>W. C.</HI> should happen to be an Existence separate from <HI>Scriblerus</HI> it appears
however, very plainly, from his Manner of Thinking, that he is very
like him, and therefore might easily be mistaken for him. In this Case,
we can only say, that the Passion of Friendship has misled him, and we
must forgive the Weakness of his Head, for the Warmth of his Heart.
This Praise-worthy Zeal, for maintaining a Cause, the Goodness or Bad∣ness
of which, the Advocate is absolutely ignorant of, reminds me of a
Story, told me by a very merry old Fellow, who was in his Youth
enroll'd as a private Gentleman in the Life-Guards of King <HI>William</HI>:
He was in Esteem with the rest of the Troop, as a <HI>Soldier of Let∣ters,</HI>
and was call'd by the Gentlemen of the Belt, by Way of Di∣stinction,
<HI>The Schollar.</HI> This Character he bore unrival'd for some
Time, 'till a Brother of the Sword, grew jealous of his Reputation, and
set up against him. His Rival, who had been Book-keeper to a
Carrier, (and from thence derived his Title to Letters) took every Op∣portunity
of opposing him, when any Subject, a little out of the Reach
of the rest of the Company, was started. One Evening, my Friend,
in the Height of his Argument, threw out a Sentence of <HI>Tully,</HI> and
was immediately taken up by his Antagonist for <HI>false Latin</HI>; the De∣bate
ran high, the Troop divided upon the Point, and yet were un∣willing
to determine positively in a Cause, into the Merits of which,
they could not see; 'till one, who was the Book-keeper's Comrade,
a very brave, tho' not a learned Man, pull'd him by the Sleeve,
and leading him into a private Room, directed him to lay his Hand
upon his Heart, and inform him, <HI>upon his Honour,</HI> Whether the
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
Words spoken, <HI>were true or false Latin</HI>? And being answer'd, upon
his <HI>Honour</HI> they were <HI>false Latin</HI>; he return'd immediately into the
Circle of the Warriors they had left, and placing his Hand on his Sword,
declar'd with great Intrepidity, That the <HI>Latin</HI> the Gentleman had
spoken, was <HI>false Latin,</HI> and he would maintain it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE> <DATELINE><DATE>April the 5th, 1729.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TOGETHER, with the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> I am to return your Lord∣ship
many Thanks for the Loan of so uncommon a Piece,
which cannot but be highly welcome to all the true Lovers
of Scandal, since it leaves them no Room to doubt, as to most of the
Persons libell'd in it. You were pleas'd to assure me, my Lord,
that it was left at your House by an unknown Hand, and that
you were an utter Stranger both to the Author and to the Nature
of his Performance. It is but reasonable therefore, that I should sa∣tisfy
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
your Lordship, as to these two Particulars, in Return for your
Goodness in lending me this Book, when I had sought for it in vain,
by the Means of all the Booksellers and Publishers in Town. It may
not be improper at the same Time to acquaint you, that Copies have
been left at many Peers Houses, in the same Manner as your Lord∣ship's
was, whilst the Favourites of the Author have had whole Cargoes
sent them to dispose of. Thus has a little insignificant Lampooner, with
unparallell'd Impudence, made People of the first Quality, privy to,
and some of them innocently Publishers of his Scandal; for which,
doubtless he will be chastised as he deserves.</P>
<P>I find at the Head of this <HI>Libel,</HI> a long stupid Letter, which tho' sub∣scrib'd
by another Name, must doubtless by <HI>Scriblerus</HI>'s, or, which is
the same Thing, the Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>'s Encomium upon him∣self.
He has, I know not with what Intent, brought in the Praises too
of one Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> maliciously insinuating, that this Poem was of his
composing, which one would fancy it impossible it should be; for
that Writer, after having acquir'd the Dignity of a <HI>Poet,</HI> would surely
never condescend to accept of the Office of <HI>Scavenger,</HI> and rake into
all the Filth of the Town. I confess, I at first conceiv'd the Name sub∣scribed
to this Letter, to be such an one as <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> but I have
been since assured, that it is no fictitious Name, but the real one of
a Person now living, who is deeply read in the Indexes of Books
and the Secret Histories of Families. Whether this be the Letter-writer's
establish'd Character or not, the World must judge; but this
I will venture to affirm, that as the <HI>Real</HI> Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> can add
no Reputation to this <HI>William Cleland,</HI> so this <HI>William Cleland</HI> can add
no Reputation to the Author of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> Should there be any
Thing here like the Association between the Lion and the Jackcall, I believe
in this Case, the <HI>Jackcall</HI> would prove the <HI>greater Beast</HI> of the Two:
Not that I would be hereby thought to exclude this Person from any
Title he may have to the other of these Appellations. I remember to
have been present at a Trial for a Rape, wherein, the Girl, to prove
her former Chastity, brought in an old Bawd for her Evidence: Doubt∣less
this Story will admit of no Application in the present Case; but
to use a Scrap of this Man's own Scrap of <HI>Latin, FASTIDITIS
GRATIAM.</HI></P>
<P>Being then oblig'd to presume, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s known Veracity and good
Nature would not admit him to be suspected of having wrote such an Heap
of Lies and Abuse as is contained in the <HI>Dunciad</HI>; I have used my ut∣most
Endeavours to discover the true Author of that Poem, and having
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
succeeded in my Research, I have prefix'd to this Tract his <HI>Effigies,</HI> as
it has been exactly transcrib'd from a <HI>Busto,</HI> which was return'd
upon a certain ingenious Sculptor's Hand, for resembling, in a most
unflattering Manner, the Original. By the <HI>rueful</HI> Features of it, I am
confident your Lordship will immediately discover who is the renown'd
Father of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>You will not, I am sure, expect that I should enter into an Ex∣amination
of the Poetical Merit of that Piece; that would subject
me to a Task, for which I am wholly unfit; I mean, the reading it
a second Time. But I am well inform'd, that the Reception which
the first Edition met with from the Town, shewed that the Perfor∣mance
was thought as mean as the Design. In my cursory View of
it, tho' I met with some Lines here and there Poetical enough, yet
I thought the Generality of them very Prosaick, the whole Tale loose
and unconnected, the Transitions unnatural, the Parodies on the most
admir'd Passages of the Ancients, were not only too frequent, but
likewise too faintly and poorly wrought up, either to strike or de∣light
the Reader; and besides, the Nastiness of the <HI>Games,</HI> and of
all the Imagery in the Poem, the very Language often sunk into
downright Ribaldry, as when a <HI>Gentlewomans Breasts</HI> are stiled her
<HI>Fore-Buttocks</HI> or her <HI>Cow-like Udders.</HI> Upon the whole, I judg'd this
<HI>Dunciad</HI> to be below all Criticism, both as to its Stile and Versifi∣cation.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Morality of it, as well as of the Notes of <HI>Scriblerus</HI>
and <HI>Variorum,</HI> may deserve a much stricter Scrutiny. Felons in the
Condemn'd Hold at <HI>Newgate,</HI> who have no Characters to forfeit, and
but little Enjoyment of Life to lose, may venture to attack the Re∣putations
of other Men, without Fear or Shame; but, unless under
those Circumstances, none but a Madman could be tempted to do it.
How shall I astonish your Lordship then, when I assure you, that no
desperate Raver, but a poor Reptile; who, as he is the most helpless,
is likewise the most timid Creature living, has acted this Part. He
is become a voluntary Prisoner to his own House, rather than not
enjoy the pitiful Pleasure of aspersing with Impunity, Persons, all of
them better Members of the Community than himself, and many of
them of a much higher Rank in Life than he must ever pretend to;
who can only derive a <HI>Mock Title,</HI> not from his Ancestors, but his
Shoulders. In his first Edition he had traduc'd certain Characters, for
which every one has always had the utmost Veneration, and thinks
now, by leaving out the Names of some, and falsly filling up the
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
Blanks of others, as well as by absconding for a Time, to escape the
Stripes that ought to be the just Reward of such Writings. How mon∣strous
therefore has it been, to insinuate, that they have reach'd a
Presence, where <HI>Good Nature, Truth,</HI> and <HI>Humanity</HI> only can be gra∣ciously
receiv'd or encourag'd; the Reverse whereof are the <HI>Characte∣risticks</HI>
of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>?</P>
<P>I am sensible that the Retailers in Scandal have always endeavour'd
to pass upon the World by the laudable Appellation of Satyrists, and
would take Shelter under the great Names of <HI>Horace, Juvenal,</HI> and
<HI>Boileau.</HI> Not considering, that these Precedents will never be to their
Purpose; those generous Correctors of Vice, never attack'd Persons, but
Errors, nor ever expos'd the private Character, but the publick Ap∣pearance
of Men, at the same Time taking especial Care to pay the
strictest Regard to Truth, even while the Scourge was in their
Hands; and therefore, <HI>Boileau,</HI> in his own Vindication, speaking of
<HI>Chapelain,</HI> who was a bad Poet, says,
<Q><L>En blamant ses ecrits, ai je d'un Style Affreux</L>
<L>Distille sur sa Vie un Venin Dangereux.</L></Q>
I must likewise inform this half-learned Tribe, that the <HI>Codrus</HI> of <HI>Ju∣venal,</HI>
which these abusive Writers so often quote for their Justification,
was no real Person, but a Name design'd in general to signify any bad
Poet.</P>
<P>True and just Satyr will always have its Weight; Scandal will al∣ways
be condemn'd: The one is beneficial to Society, the other is detri∣mental
to it. Whensoever a Man has taken upon himself the Profes∣sion
of any Art or Science, by Writing, or otherwise, he has certainly
submitted his Talents therein to the Judgment of the World. A Wri∣ter
therefore, who in that Art or Science, consistent with good Man∣ners,
exposes the Defects of his Fellow Writer, be it by Ridicule or
Argument, is guilty of nothing that is blameable, but rather does a
Praise-worthy Action, by endeavouring to rectify the Judgments of
Men, and prevent Pretenders to Science from imposing on the Publick.
The censuring an Author then, only as such, is what every Man has a
Right to do, from the Moment he appears in Print, <HI>Hanc Veniam peti∣mus{que}
Damus{que} vicissim.</HI> But under this Pretext to attack his private Re∣putation,
as a Member of Society, must be the Result of the same vil∣lainous
Principles, as would lead a Man to be guilty of Robbery or
Murder, had he Courage enough for the Road. The Civil Magistrate
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
alone has a Right to enquire into Mens Personal Characters, and if they
deserve it, to expose and punish them: And it seems but just, that
this Authority should be vested solely in him, since no one else can,
with any Certainty, be inform'd of what passes in private Life.</P>
<P>The Predecessors of the Writer of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> the elaborate Au∣thors
of <HI>Grubstreet,</HI> have frequently transgress'd this equitable Rule,
and finding too general a Propensity towards enquiring into the Ble∣mishes
of (otherwise) Great Characters, have sometimes been pretty
liberal of their Personal Reflections, in order to render their several
<HI>Dunciads</HI> the more Saleable: Yet these Men had at least so much Decency,
as to do this under feign'd Names, or by pointing at Persons only by
their initial Letters, which were lyable to various Readings. Thus,
whilst the Obscurity of their Scandal screen'd them from Punishment,
their very Proceeding was a tacit Confession of the Guilt of such
Invectives. But it was doubtless reserv'd for the <HI>Modest</HI> Author of the
<HI>Dunciad</HI> to invent the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of Scandal, by calling Men, every
Way his Superiors, <HI>Rogues, Blockheads, Drunkards,</HI> and <HI>Liars,</HI> in Print,
with their Names at length, whilst he suppresses his own, that he
may be exempt from the Fear of a very low Punishment, but to
which his Ears seem to be legally intitled.</P>
<P>As this is my first Appearance in Print, I have hitherto escap'd the
Malice of this Scandalmonger's Pen, and do not now write out of any
Hatred to him, but real Love for Mankind. A Regard to Humanity,
and the Rules of Society, have rais'd in me an Indignation against a Wri∣ter,
who has the Insolence to appear in Publick, in Defiance of them
all. I am resolv'd, therefore (tho' such a Procedure, with Relation to
any honest Man would be detestable) to mark him to the World; let us
examine a little into the Character of this diminutive Creature, who
makes so free with those of other Men.</P>
<P>I find, that upon his first coming to Town, out of pure Compassion
for his exotick Figure, narrow Circumstances, and humble Appearance,
the late Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> admitted him into his Society, and suffer'd him,
notwithstanding his Make, to be his humble admirer at <HI>Will</HI>'s; and af∣terwards
finding in him a glimmering of Genius, recommended him
to some People of Rank, and introduc'd him to the most eminent Men
of Letters; which Courtesy he soon after repaid with a satyrical Copy
of Verses on his Benefactor: This put an End to their Correspondence
some Time before Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> dy'd. His Acquaintance by this
Means being made with Sir <HI>Richard Steele,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> they
likewise, in Compassion to his unhappy Form, and destitute Condition,
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
endeavoured to procure him a Support under both, by setting on Foot
a Subscription in his Behalf; it was, indeed, for a Work, which (as
has since appeared) they must have known he was not equal to; but
they hoped, with their friendly Assistance, to have supply'd his Defects.
However, his Subscriptions were no sooner full, when the little mis∣chievous
Urchin, no longer able to contain his Malice, wrote a Satyr
upon both these Gentlemen, (as he did afterwards an abusive Libel on
one of them;) and as many Things which had pass'd in private Con∣versation
at <HI>Button</HI>'s Coffee-house, came to be known by the Lord <HI>O<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI>
of which Infidelity <HI>Scriblerus</HI> was suspected, he was obliged to absent
himself for some Years from thence. After this, he listed openly in the
<HI>Tory</HI> Service, and every Week publish'd scandalous Invectives on those
very <HI>Whigs,</HI> who had been his amplest <HI>Subscribers.</HI> He was in this ho∣nourable
Occupation, when the late Queen dy'd; and our Poet soon
changing his Note, found Means to be introduced to some of the young
Ladies of the Court. Four of these, who were his best Friends and
Patronesses, (as they are to any Thing that carries the Face of Wit or
Learning) he abused in a Scurvy Ballad, for which any other Man
would have received Correction; but in his Case, these generous Ladies
contented themselves with shewing a Contempt of his Malice, and
banishing him their Company. This did not hinder him from wri∣ting
a second Lampoon, wherein he spared not the most exalted Cha∣racters,
though under feigned Names; and adding Treachery to Ill-Nature,
he threw the scandalous Imputation of having wrote this
Libel, on a Lady of Quality, whose Wit is equal to her Beauty, and
whose Character might have suffer'd by this impudent Forgery of his.
But I begin to be tired, as I believe your Lordship is too, with raking
into the dirty Parts of this foul Character. I shall therefore pass over
the many other low Scenes of his Life, to come to his Master-piece
of Scandal, the <HI>DUNCIAD.</HI> This mishapen Lump of Malice and
Ill-nature, at the earnest Request of all his Friends, who feared his
Abuse more than his Enemies, had for some Years forborn writing
Lampoons, except it were on a <HI>Curl</HI> or a <HI>Lintot</HI>; when at last, grown
weary of this Restraint, and unable to live in Peace with Society, he
collected a List of Names, yet unabused by him, and resolved to throw
them together into one Satyr. To furnish himself, therefore, with
Matter, he went round all his Cully Booksellers, enquiring for Scandal of
any Kind; and an abusive Story being told him, of a Parson in Drink,
which the Relater thought could not come within his Scheme of Satyr,
as reflecting upon one that had never appear'd in Print; he told him
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
that he was resolved to put it down to <HI>Laurus</HI>; for as to the <HI>Truth</HI>
of it, the Town would never be at the Trouble to enquire into
that.</P>
<P>Thus compiled, and thus composed, the <HI>DUNCIAD</HI> made its
Appearance last Summer, and was so universally exploded for its wit∣less
Ill-nature and Falshood, that the Gentlemen traduced in it, being
only pointed at by their Initial Letters, did not think it worth their
Care to correct the Author, in the Manner he deserv'd. Yet I have
been credibly inform'd, that some of them resorted to no Place where
<HI>Scriblerus</HI> might possibly be met with, without the Provision of a Rod,
to whip this <HI>Old Boy,</HI> for his untoward Malice. But he absconding for
above a Month, and the Scandal having hurt no Creature, but the Au∣thor
himself, their Resentment cool'd; and the little Lampooner might
have been at Peace, had he not wantonly reviv'd the Memory of his
former Malice, by reprinting this pitiful Poem on Royal Paper, giving
at full Length the Names of most of those mention'd in It; together
with a Comment more abusive than the Text; which he published
under an Appellation very proper to himself, I mean that of <HI>Scrib∣lerus.</HI>
This was such a consummate Piece of Insolence, as one would
think could admit of no Aggravation; yet he found Means to add one
Degree of Impudence more to it, by presuming at first to make Men
of Rank and Quality, in a Manner, his <HI>Publishers.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lordship may wonder, that one, who has conducted himself
after this Manner, should not have suffer'd under the due Correction of
some of those, whom he has thus wantonly abused. It is most certain,
that nothing in the Figure of a Man, could have escaped Punishment,
for such repeated Insults, many of them on Persons of Distinction. But
this Poetaster having unhappily a Resemblance in his Size and Make, to
the Animal much inferior to Man; it seems he has been universally
look'd upon, as beneath the Dignity of Resentment. Upon this Occa∣sion,
I cannot but call to Mind a Story (which I have somewhere read)
of an honest Highlander, who was walking along <HI>Holborn,</HI> when he
heard a Voice cry, <HI>Rogue Scot, Rogue Scot,</HI> his Northern Blood fired at
the Insult, and he drew his broad Sword, looking round him on every
Side, to discover the Object of his Indignation, when at last he found
that the Voice came from a Parrot, perch'd on a Balcony within his Reach;
But the <HI>Generous Scot,</HI> disdaining to stain his Trusty Blade with such
ignoble Blood, put up his Sword again, with a sour Smile, saying, <HI>Gin
ye were a Mon, as ye're a Green Geuse, I would split your Weem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="21"/>
A Sword, indeed, has never been deem'd a Weapon fit for the Cor∣rection
of Libellers. <HI>Thersites,</HI> who, in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Homer,</HI> resembles
our Author, both in Shape and Malice, was cudgell'd by <HI>Ulysses,</HI> for
his faucy Language to his Betters. <HI>Aretin,</HI> the only Author, besides
that of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> within these Three Hundred Years, that acquired
a famous Infamy by his Pen, bragg'd of keeping many Kings and Prin∣ces
tributary to him, in order to purchase an Exemption from his Sa∣tyrs.
Yet it seems, some of the Princes of his own Country found out
a better Method of dealing with him; for having been abused by him,
they order'd the insolent Creature such a Bastinado, as at once put an
End to his Satyrical Vein. And being by this Treatment brought to
himself, he had such a true Sense of his vile Character, that he turned
his Mind wholly toward Devotion: In which Strain he wrote many
Books with such Success, as to obtain at length, the Name of the <HI>Di∣vine
Aretin.</HI> Should the like Treatment of the Father of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>
produce the like Effect, what Service might he not be of to Religion,
by composing Pious Hymns, for the great Festivals of the Year, and
perhaps by a Translation of all the <HI>Psalms,</HI> the first of which, it seems,
he has already imitated in a most edifying Manner? Were <HI>Scriblerus</HI> to
undertake the whole <HI>Psalms,</HI> and perform that Work with the Justness
and Accuracy of his other Translations, it might not only eclipse <HI>Stern∣hold</HI>
and <HI>Hopkins,</HI> but even vie with that of <HI>Tate</HI> and <HI>Brady</HI>: And
then, what would not the Publick owe to those, who, by the <HI>Human</HI>
Means of a Stick, should have wrought so useful, as well as <HI>praeter natu∣ral</HI>
a <HI>Conversion.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Aretin</HI> had the Shape of a Man, and might bear a <HI>Beating</HI>;
whereas, our Poet must of Necessity expire under the very first Blow;
and he can, by the Structure of his Person, only be liable to one Sort
of Correction, that of the <HI>Rod</HI>; which some Years ago Mr. <HI>Ambrose
Philips,</HI> being abused by him, bought for his Use, and stuck up at
the Bar of <HI>Button</HI>'s Coffee-house; and which he avoided by his usual
Practice after every Lampoon, of remaining a close Prisoner at Home.
The same Discipline was prepar'd for him last Summer, which he
escap'd in the Manner abovementioned; and I am inform'd, that the
Rods are now ready for his Chastisement, as soon as he shall be
found in a proper Place for whipping.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, as all Criminals who fly from Justice are exe∣cuted
in <HI>Effigie,</HI> his Figure is exposed, and four Inscriptions under it,
on the several Sides of the Pedestal, in <HI>Greek, Latin, Spanish,</HI> and
<HI>English.</HI> In the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> for having offended those Languages,
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
by presuming to translate or imitate what he did not understand:
And in his native Tongue, for having made his <HI>British</HI> Muse, which
ought to be chaste and delicate, to speak the Language of the Stews,
and of <HI>Billingsgate.</HI> The <HI>Spanish Inscription</HI> carries in it an Instruc∣tion
which might have been of use to him had he read it, before he
became a <HI>Libeller</HI> instead of a <HI>Satyrist.</HI> This curious Image having
been communicated to me, by one of those who are abused in the
<HI>Dunciad,</HI> in whose Possession it now is, I thought it proper to take
a Cut from it, which I have prefix'd to this Publication.</P>
<P>Whensoever it happens, that a worthy Mind is lodg'd in a deform'd
Body, I am perswaded that all vertuous Men commiserate the Case,
and far from indulging any Reflections on the Figure, would use
their utmost Endeavours to make both the Owner and the rest of the
World forget it: But when, as is the sad Fate of the Author of
the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> a crooked Carcass is become the Habitation of a much
more crooked Mind; and when this Creature, far from being hum∣bled
by the irregularity of the Form assign'd him by Providence,
makes the very Despicableness of it a Protection to him, for venting
such Malice, as he would not dare to utter, were he a possible Mark for
Indignation to lay hold of. I think, in such a Case, Mind and Body,
which seem so well adapted to each other, should go together, and
be jointly exhibited and expos'd to the Contempt of that Society,
which can have no other Reparations made them, for the Injuries of
such an untoward Animal.</P>
<P>A vertuous Man has strongly implanted in him a Philanthropy or
innate Humanity, which restrains him from reflecting too severely
on the Frailties of his Fellow Creatures, as remembring, that they are
all of them of one Species. But <HI>Scriblerus</HI> distinguished indeed, in a
most remarkable Manner, by Nature, from the rest of Mankind; has no
Tenderness or Regard for them, but looks upon himself as one of a quite
different Race of Beings; nor shall I ever look upon him in another
Light.</P>
<P>Where, indeed, is the Definition of <HI>Man,</HI> to which he can be said
to answer? If <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> be the Term, can he have the Assurance to pre∣tend
to that Characteristick, who looks with Envy on every Thing
that contributes to the Peace or Benefit of Society, and is never happy,
but when he is creating Feuds and Animosities even amongst the
most intimate of his Acquintance? If Man be stiled a <HI>Rational</HI> Crea∣ture,
will <HI>Scriblerus</HI> come within that Description, who knowing how
little able he is to defend either his own Character or Person, wan∣tonly
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
begins the Attack on others? <HI>Man</HI> is often defined to be a <HI>Ri∣sible
Animal</HI>; were this meant to denote a <HI>Creature that we laugh</HI> at, the
Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> would bid fair to be comprehended; but all
the Grammarians agree, that it signifies an <HI>Animal susceptible of Laugh∣ter,</HI>
which, <HI>Scriblerus</HI> was never in good Humour enough, with him∣self,
or others, to be, nor has he been observ'd, since the Hour of his
Birth, to have risen above a broad Grin, common to him with the
Quadrupede, most resembling Human Nature. Thus, whatsoever is the
Definition, He still appears excluded from the Human Species, which
may in some Measure account for, as well as excuse his universal
ill Will to our Race.</P>
<P>As I find that this last pompous Edition of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> is in <HI>Quarto,</HI>
I have conform'd myself to that Size in this Publication, that your
Lordship may be enabled to bind up this true Account of the <HI>Au∣thor</HI>
and his <HI>Effigies</HI> with the Work it self, since all of them seem
calculated for one and the same Purpose, to make his <HI>Infamy immor∣tal,
and his Malice contemptible.</HI></P>
<P>I have the Pleasure to give your Lordship in Publick, this Testimo∣ny
of my Obedience, and of the Respect with which</P>
<CLOSER>I am,

honour'd with the Residence of a
small modern Classic, and of some of
his Poetical Underlings and Commen∣tators.
It is most pleasantly situated,
on the Banks of the Great River

<HI>Lyric</HI> Poetry, by the late Mr. <HI>Thomas

<HI>British</HI> Adage, <HI>Little and Loud.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>And</HI> Martin Scribler <HI>was his Name.</HI></Q>
<P>He was not like the Generality of
Clerks, content with reading or sing∣ing
the Works of other Men, but
likewise composed many of his own.
And perhaps too audaciously as well
as too ludicrously invaded the Sacred
Province of <HI>King David,</HI> by vying with
him in Psalmody. Tho' I am told,
that our <HI>Martin</HI> went no farther than
the First Psalm, not having met with
any Sort of Encouragement in that
Undertaking.</P>
<P><HI>Steeple Crown'd.</HI> A most adequate
Expression for the Crown of a Parish-Clerk,
whose <HI>Head</HI> in this Respect,
bears a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Resemblance to a Steeple,
inasmuch as both are intended for the
Omament of the Church. What
<HI>Church Scribler's Steeple-Crown</HI> now a∣dorneth,
is as much a Question, as it
was anciently what City might claim
the Birth of <HI>Homer.</HI> However, it
should seem by the <HI>Crown</HI> being its
self a <HI>Steeple,</HI> that <HI>Martin</HI>'s <HI>Typical
Head</HI> belonged to some <HI>Church</HI> that
claimed to <HI>itself</HI> the Supremacy.</P>
<P><HI>Cricket</HI>'s <HI>Voice.</HI> This is an Animal
famous for the Smallness of his Voice

into the Chimneys of old Houses,
where there is much Filth and Nasti∣ness,
and where the Walls are full of

find out their Flaws, are often assimi∣lated

<P><HI>Rueful Face.</HI> How blind, alas! are
all Mortals in their own Case; you

<P>And I take it, the true Reason why
our Poet left those Gaps, was because
he could not fill them up. But one
Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></HI> having call'd upon him,
in a very earnest Manner to do him
that Favour; he discover'd two <HI>Re∣plenishers,</HI>
or in the Political Language,
<HI>Stop-Gaps,</HI> and the Verse ran thus.<Q><HI>Thy Dragons</HI> Magistrates <HI>and</HI> Peers
<HI><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/>,</HI></Q>And it might as well have been,<Q><L><HI>Thy Dragons</HI> Shrieves <HI>and</HI> Sword∣bearer

well thus,<Q>


<L><HI>Thy Dragons</HI> Fa fe fi fo fum <HI>shall taste,</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>From this one Instance, the curi∣ous
Reader may discover, that a Re∣plenisher
is a Word which adds to
the Measure without affecting the
Sense of the Verse, not unlike the
false Calves worn by the <HI>Spindle∣shank'd,</HI>
which help the outward Ap∣pearance
of the Leg, without con∣tributing
any Thing to its Strength.</P>
<P><HI>This Loon. Loon</HI> in <HI>Minshew,</HI> is said
to signify the same as <HI>Lout,</HI> but in <HI>Bai∣ley</HI>
it is made to denote a <HI>dull heavy
headed Fellow, lazy,</HI> and <HI>good for Nothing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Beauk learn'd Scot.</HI> Here our Au∣thor
in speaking of a <HI>Scotchman,</HI>
very humorously and elegantly falls
into the very Dialect of that Coun∣try;
doubtless in Imitation of the
Classic Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> where
he speaks of <HI>Wormius</HI> a great <HI>Anti∣quary,</HI>
and maketh use of the old
<HI>English</HI> Style, calling him the <HI>Myster
Wight.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Term <HI>Beuk-learn'd,</HI> I
find our Scholiast observes, that this
<HI>Scotchman</HI> was apt to examine Books
as expert Jockeys do Horses, only by
their <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Tail,</HI> and was there∣fore
deeply read in the <HI>Title Pages</HI>
and <HI>Indexes only.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Immortal Fame. Corrige meo periculo,</HI>
and read <HI>Immoral Fame.</HI> For altho'
all the Manuscripts agree with the
Text, yet is it very manifest, that
the spurious <HI>t</HI> must have crept into
the first Manuscript by the Inaccura∣cy
of the <HI>Transcriber,</HI> who, being
doubtless one of little Genius, did
not perceive how <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> it was, to
attribute the Word <HI>Immortal</HI> to the
<HI>Fame</HI> of any of <HI>Scriblers</HI> Works. And
this Error being once crept in, the
servile Transcribers have all follow'd
one another in it. From this one
Example, I think the Reader may
infer, notwithstanding the vulgar
Opinion to the contrary, That <HI>Good
Sense</HI> is required to constitute a True <HI>Critick.</HI></P>

peradventure he might have attained
to the Force of carrying a great

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="receipt">
<HEAD>A Curious Receipt, wherein is disclosed,
the Art of writing Poetry with a small
Genius, taken from <HI>MARTINUS
SCRIBLERUS's</HI> Writings.</HEAD>
<P>READER, be thou Gentle, or be thou otherwise, I have al∣way
thy Profit and Pleasure before mine Eyes, from the
which I shall not readily swerve, else mayest Thou, in all
Probability, cast me off, as is usually practic'd with unprofitable
Servants. As I have by my Sagacity discover'd certain mechanical
Rules, by the Help whereof <HI>Scriblerus</HI> hath obtained unto himself
the Name of a mighty Poet: I question not, but the imparting
the same unto Thee, will be of Contentment and Delight. It may
furthermore be a Work conducive toward the Strength and Glory of
this my native Island, by multiplying the Number of Poets therein.
These have hitherto been but few, from a mistaken Opinion, that a Ge∣nius,
Learning, and a good Ear, were requisite to constitute a Poet;
whereas, from the following plain and easy Rules, it will most evi∣dently
appear, that Application and Practice only are necessary. By the
Help of these, I will undertake, that any industrious <HI>Englishman,</HI> may,
in the Space of one Month, become as great a Versificator, as even the
Great <HI>Scriblerus</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Let the Man then, whose sublime Passion it is to shine in Poesy,
accustom himself to <HI>Tautophonys,</HI> or Ingeminations of Sounds. This is
<PB N="2" REF="31"/>
most effectually perform'd, by selecting Words, that begin with the same
Consonant, and these placed at due Distances, Two, Three, or more,
in one and the same Verse, create a Musick in Poetry, insomuch,
as that the Lines so composed, may be indifferently, either <HI>sung</HI> or
<HI>said.</HI> Of a Truth, this is an Art, which seemeth to have escaped
the Knowledge of all the Antients, whether of <HI>Greece</HI> or of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and was hidden from the most celebrated even of our <HI>British</HI> Poets,
being, like many other inestimable Secrets, wrapt in the dark <HI>Womb</HI> of
Time, to be brought to Light only by the skilfull <HI>Midwifery</HI> of the
Renowned <HI>Scriblerus.</HI> Some Traces, indeed, there are of this Art,
amongst some of the Monkish Writers, from whence our Poet may
have taken the Hint. But the Monks never reduc'd the same to any
regular Practice (as our modern Classick hath done) nor did they
make use thereof in any but <HI>Latin</HI> Verses, and those chiefly <HI>Technical</HI>
ones, for the Help of Memory: So that the Invention, or at least
the Perfection of this <HI>Nostrum,</HI> is owing to <HI>Martinus.</HI></P>
<P>Conformable to his Rules, were I to mention an Author, whose Pride
could bear no Fame but his own, and that of his servile Flatterers,
I would make the Verses run thus,
<Q><L>Poets support, like Pamper'd Priests, their Pride;</L>
<L>Such Stigmatize as Stick not to their Side.</L></Q>
Where the well chosen <HI>P</HI>'s of the first Line, and the soft hissing
<HI>S</HI>'s of the Second, compose a most excellent Harmony. But past all
Peradventure, Courteous Reader, for such doubtless by this Time
thou art become, thou mayest deem it more for thy Instruction to
learn this Poetical Jingle in the Words of <HI>Scriblerus</HI> himself.</P>

<P>I might give a thousand more Instances of the same Nature, for in∣deed
there are not any two Lines together, in the whole <HI>Dunciad,</HI>
or in any other of the <HI>Writings</HI> of this Author, wherein the same
<HI>mechanical Trick</HI> is not practised: And it is from thence that
He hath acquir'd the Name of <HI>Melodious Martin,</HI> and not, as hath
been falsely insinuated from his having sung his own Psalm in a
certain Lutheran Congregation, the which we esteem of, only as a
fictitious Tale devis'd for Mirth, it being well known, that our Poet
belongeth to a much more ancient <HI>Church.</HI> But to return to our
Subject. Whosoever, by an unwearied Exercise in Vocabularies
and Dictionaries of Rhyme, shall have replenish'd the Tubes of his
Memory with Similar Sounds, will, in Proportion to his Application
and Labour therein, rival, or even surpass, if possible, the Merit of
our Great <HI>Martinus.</HI></P>
<P>Any Person, moderately vers'd in Poetical Works, must have re∣mark'd,
that Adjectives are most commonly foisted in, not to add to
the Sense, but in order to fill up the Measure of a Verse. In all
such Emergencies, it behoveth our Apprentice in Poesy, to make a most
fervent Search for an Adjective, that beginneth with the same Let∣ter
as his Substantive, even although the Context should seem to suf∣fer
thereby. Thus must <HI>Comfort</HI> always be cold, the <HI>Day</HI> at Noon
<HI>Dawning,</HI> the <HI>Fury</HI> even of <HI>Scriblerus Fatal, Garments Gorgeous</HI> though
all tatter'd, <HI>Head Heavy, Limbs Lazy, Mind Muddy, Night Noisy,</HI>
<HI>Plight Pleasing</HI> be it never so sad, <HI>Quail Quivering, Rake Reeling</HI> tho'
sober, <HI>Sot Social,</HI> and <HI>Treat</HI> or <HI>Theobald Tasteless.</HI> True it is, that
<PB N="4" REF="33"/>
this ingenious Gentleman hath manifested as good a Taste as any of
our Writers whatsoever; but what hath Truth to do with <HI>Scriblerick</HI>
Poetry? His Name, and <HI>Tasteless,</HI> both commence with the same Letter;
and therefore, untill He shall present us with a more convenient Ad∣jective,
beginning with a T, He must be contented with this abusive
and unjust one, <HI>Euphoniae Gratia.</HI></P>
<P>These Adjectives, or others in their Stead, having been choicely
collected, as has been premis'd, out of the Dictionary, constant Re∣gard
being had to the initial Consonant, they must at sometimes immedi∣ately
precede or follow their Respective Substantives, and at others
may be sever'd at a due Distance from the same, from whence
will result a most delectable Variety of Harmony. For the first Sort,
take this <HI>Example,</HI>

<P>Thus have I, worthy Reader, explained unto Thee the first Secret
in <HI>Scriblerus</HI>'s Poesy, namely, That Divine one of Ingemination; and
as I have set before Thee a great Diversity of Examples, These
must suffice to give Thee full Light into this Mystery; the Rest
must be the Result of thine own Diligence in putting this Precept
Properly in Practice.</P>
<P>Proceed we then to certain other mechanical Rules, whereby great
and eminent Poets may be produc'd, without the Help of Genius. In
the second Place therefore the
<Q>— Hiatus in M. S. valde Deflendus</Q></P>
<P>Although in this Place there be a Gap in our Manuscript, which can
never enough be lamented by the Learned, yet are there preserv'd
to us many Fragments of the same, containing most curious Secrets;
<PB N="6" REF="35"/>
but as they are replete with Quotations from <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> I must defer
exhibiting them 'till a more convenient Season. I think in the long
Winter Nights, in which all well regulated Families assemble round
the Chimney, a Present of this Nature may not be uncomfortable.
At such a Season, should any one, endued with an even steady Voice,
read the many Excerptions out of <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> contain'd in the re∣maining
Parts of this Manuscript, what with the genial Warmth of
the Fire, the Lullaby whistling of the Wind, and the <HI>Monotony,</HI> or
Sameness of Sound in the Verses, That Slumber might effectually
be procur'd, which is so soporiferously describ'd in the second Book
of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> Perhaps that good Effect might be produc'd at this
very Hour, without any concurring Helps, were it possible to find
People, whose Blood in Spring ran sluggish enough to sit still and
hear such a <HI>Work</HI> read to them.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the great Veneration I have for the Author of the
preceding Manuscript, yet must I beg leave to animadvert on one
Assertion therein, which I take to be erroneous; <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Divine
Art of Ingemination of Sounds</HI> in Poesy, was the sole Invention of
<HI>Martinus Scriblerus</HI>; whereas, in Justice to the Memory of his Pre∣decessor
Mr. <HI>John Grub,</HI> the Great Founder of the Street and Sect,
which still bear his Name, I shall venture to affirm, that he was no
Stranger to this Mystery. This will most evidently appear by a most
curious Fragment of his, which I shall here subjoin; and which,
perhaps, may be a Present as welcome to the Publick, as those many
Books of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> said to have been lately retriev'd by the Fidelity
of the <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Library Keeper, who may well be styl'd the
<HI>Bentley</HI> of the East. Such is the Beauty of the Allegory, couch'd
in the few Lines of our Fragment, and such the Harmony of its
Versification, as may justly entitle it to a Place in the next <HI>Edition</HI>
of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> The Verses of Mr. <HI>Grub</HI> are as follow.</P>
<Q><L>Thus Trojan Boots ting'd with Tartarean Glue,</L>
<L>Near which the Greasy Great Gambadoes Grew,</L>
<L>While Coaches rumbled round my Roman Nose,</L>
<L>And green Iniquity grew grey in Prose.</L></Q>
<P>I intended here to have taken Leave of my Patient Reader, (for
such doubtless he is, who has been so good as to accompany me
thus far) but reflecting with my self, That our <HI>Martinus</HI> hath not
had the Leisure or Occasion of celebrating the due Praises of his
