<HEAD>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
<HI>GEORGE DODINGTON,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
One of the LORDS COMMISSIONERS of His
Majesty's Treasury.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following little Treatise is, to all Ap∣pearance,
so very a Trifle, that I should
not have the Assurance to address it to a
Gentleman of your distinguish'd Rank, if
my chief Design were not to engage you,
in order to promote the Honour of your
Country, and the Good of the learned World, to take
upon you the Protection of the <HI>British</HI> Dramatical Muses,
so far at least as to pronounce in their Favour. 'Tis the
Sense of all who have the Honour to be acquainted with
you, that you have a perfect Knowledge of the Merits of
the Cause, and Ability and Authority to determine it in
the last Appeal. The <HI>British</HI> Dramatick Muses make this
Request to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> who have been barbarously used both
by their Friends and their Enemies; for by their Friends
they have been more than once poorly deserted, and a∣bandon'd
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
to the Slanders and the unjust Accusations of
their most inveterate Enemies.</P>
<P>I appeal to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> if they are not idle Dreamers
who believe, that a great, a powerful, and an opulent Peo∣ple
can be without publick Diversions; or if it is fitting
they should be without them. I appeal to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> if
a great and a brave People, by being often assembled and
pleased together, will not be the more pleased with one
another, and the more among themselves united.</P>
<P>But as all Pleasures and Diversions, both publick and
private, are barbarous or gentle, rational or sensual, man∣ly
or effeminate, noble or base and degenerate; 'tis agreed
on by all the sensible World, that the publick Diversions
of a free Nation, ought neither to be barbarous, nor sen∣sual,
nor base, nor effeminate; because publick Diversions
of the first Kind reflect Dishonour upon a brave Nation;
and Diversions of the other three Kinds have a natural
Tendency to the introducing a general and total Corrup∣tion
of Manners, which is inconsistent with Liberty.</P>
<P>The publick Diversions which are at present establish'd
in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> are either the Combats of our modern
Gladiators, or the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera's, or the Masquerades,
or Tragedies and Comedies, which are the only genuine
legitimate Entertainments of the Stage.</P>
<P>As for the first of these, the Combats of our modern
Gladiators, I appeal to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> who by travelling have
had the Advantage of knowing the Sentiments and Man∣ners
of other Nations, if they are not regarded by all
<HI>Europe,</HI> excepting our selves, with Horror, and esteem'd to
be neither agreeable to the Spirit of Christianity, nor to
the Manners of a civilized People.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>
As to the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera's, they are allow'd by all the
impartial World to be sensual and effeminate, compared to
the genuine Drama, and a greater real Promoter of wanton
and sensual Thoughts than ever the Drama was pretended
to be, because too great a Part of them consisting of Soft∣ness
of Sound, and of Wantonness of Thought, they have
nothing of that good Sense and Reason, and that artful
Contrivance which are essential to the Drama. No, you
know very well, <HI>Sir,</HI> that good Sense and Reason, and
every strict Attention to an artful Design, are so many
natural and moral Restraints upon wanton and sensual
Thoughts.</P>
<P>I now, <HI>Sir,</HI> desire Leave to say something concerning
Masquerades, which Mr. <HI>Law</HI> affirms to be more innocent
than the Drama, which is a frontless Assertion, and the very
Reverse of Reason. I remember one of our Comick Poets
observes, that young Ladies run a greater Risk of their
Reputations by being familiar with Fools, than with Men
of Sense; because Fools have but one Way of passing their
Time with them: So Masquerades having neither the
Sense of the Drama, nor the Sound of the Opera, Persons
of both Sexes may go to them either with no Design, or
with a very vile one. To which I might add the late Re∣mark
of a wise and pious Prelate, which is, <HI>That Masque∣rades
deprive Virtue and Religion of their last Refuge, Shame;
which,</HI> says he, <HI>keeps Multitudes of Sinners within the
Bounds of Decency, after they have broke thro' all the Ties
of Principle and Conscience. But this Invention sets them
free from that also; being neither better nor worse, than an
Opportunity to say and do there, what Virtue, Decency, and
Good Manners, will not permit to be said or done in any other
Place.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
This wise and pious Prelate, in this very Passage, cen∣sures
the Persons of either Sex, who frequent lewd and
prophane Plays: But he does not assert here, that there
are no Plays but what are lewd and prophane. And he
affirms, that Masquerades are of more dangerous Conse∣quence
to Virtue and Good Manners, than ev'n Plays
which are prophane.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> I have endeavour'd to shew, that of three
of the present reigning Diversions, one is cruel and bar∣barous,
and not at all becoming either of a Christian or a
civilized Nation; the Second effeminate, wanton, and sen∣sual;
and the Third, either very unmeaning, or else neither
moral nor christian.</P>
<P>No Art of Man in the most happy Age of the most
happy Nation, has been able to find out a publick Diver∣sion
that has been reasonable, noble, manly, and virtuous,
but the Drama, when it is writ as it ought be. And yet
these wild Enthusiasts, who have shot their Bolts against
the Stage, have said not a Word against the other three,
which cannot be defended by the least Pretence that any
of them can have to Goodness or moral Instruction.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> The following Treatise is not only a Defence of
Dramatick Poetry, but of the Establish'd Government, in
the Administration of which the Wisdom of the King has
given you an illustrious Share, and against which Mr.
<HI>Law</HI>'s Pamphlet is obliquely designed; as were the Writ∣ings
which his two Predecessors, <HI>Collier</HI> and <HI>Bedford,</HI> pub∣lish'd
against the Stage. <HI>Collier,</HI> by his Action, and <HI>Bed∣ford,</HI>
by his other Writings, because profess'd and declar'd
Enemies to the Government: One of them absolved an im∣penitent
Traytor, who died with Treason in his Mouth;
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
and the other, upon publishing his Book upon Hereditary
Right, was imprison'd for High Treason.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Sir,</HI> the following Treatise was likewise design'd
in Defence of all the People of Quality of both Sexes in
<HI>England,</HI> and of all the People in any Country throughout
the Christian World, where they frequent any Theatres;
all which numerous People he has very charitably given
to the Devil to have and to hold for ever.</P>
<Q><L>Nor Engine nor Device Polemick,</L>
<L>Disease nor Doctor Epedemic,</L>
<L>E'er sent so vast a Colony</L>
<L>To the infernal World as he.</L></Q>
<P>But all that I have been able to do in the Defence of so
good a Cause, is to shew, that I heartily wish well to it.
It belongs to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> and to those few who resemble
you, who have Discernment and Taste, that qualify you
to determine surely, and Honour and Justice enough to
engage you to pronounce and judge impartially, to take
the <HI>British</HI> Drama into your Protection and Patronage,
in order to retrieve its former Lustre, and augment its
Glory.</P>
<P>By taking the <HI>British</HI> Theatre into your Protection and
Patronage, you would protect and patronize every other
Branch of the <HI>British</HI> Poetry. For as the <HI>British</HI> Theatre,
as long as it was justly and judiciously managed among us,
was the only publick Rewarder of Dramatick Poetry, so
it has been the only chief Support and Encouragement of
every other Species of that noble Art. It has cherish'd
and inflamed the Spirit of Poetry, and raised a noble E∣mulation
among us, more than all our Kings and all our
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
Ministers together. From the very building of <HI>London,</HI>
to the erecting the first Theatre in it, which Time con∣tains
about thirty Centuries, we had but two <HI>British</HI>
Poets who deserve to be read: But from the Establish∣ment
of our Theatres to the present Time, which contains
scarce a Century and a half, we may boldly affirm, that
more than ten times that Number of Poets have appear'd
and flourish'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And here, <HI>Sir,</HI> I beg Leave to observe the Advantage
of Genius that <HI>Great Britain</HI> has over <HI>France</HI> with Rela∣tion
to the Drama: For our Neighbours the <HI>French,</HI> not∣withstanding
the vast Encouragement that was given by
Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> and by <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth, at the Insti∣gation
of Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> his First Minister, never could
with Justice boast of more than one Comick and two
Tragick Poets; whereas more than ten of our Country∣men,
have, without any publick Encouragement but what
they derived from the Stage itself (and that, how incon∣siderable!)
signalized themselves in Comedy alone, with∣in
the Compass of those fifty Years that followed the
Restoration.</P>
<P>I know, indeed, very well, <HI>Sir,</HI> that other Reasons may
be assigned, besides the Want of a Theatre, why no more
Poets flourished before Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time. But I
am at the same Time convinced, that the Reason why we
have had so many since, has been the Establishment of
our Theatres. For the Dramatick Poets, the Case is plain,
few would have given themselves the Trouble to write
Dramatick Poems, if there had not been Theatres in
which they might be acted. And some, who were by
Nature qualified to succeed better in other Kinds of Poetry
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
than the Dramatick, had, by Reason of the Lowness of
their Fortunes, been uncapable of exerting their Genius's
in those other Kinds, if they had not been first encou∣raged,
and raised, and supported by the Stage. And 'tis
very natural to conceive, that several others, who at the
same time that they had large Revenues, were qualified
both by Nature and Art to excel in the other Kinds, were
rouzed and excited to try their Fortunes in them, by the
animating Applauses which they saw that our Dramatick
Poets received from their ravish'd Audiences. The Sen∣timent
of <HI>Virgil</HI> might, on such Occasions, very naturally
present itself to their Minds.<Q><L>—Tentanda via est quâ me quoque possim</L>
<L>Tollere humo, victorque virûm volitare per ora.</L></Q></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> since the chief Encouragement not only
of Plays, but of every other Kind of the <HI>British</HI> Poetry,
which is none of the meanest Branches of the <HI>British</HI>
Learning, depends upon the Stage, and consequently the
Honour of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in some measure depends upon
it, I humbly conceive, that the flourishing Condition of
our Theatre is a Matter of Importance and publick Con∣cern,
and not unworthy the Consideration of the greatest
Men in the State.</P>
<P>Since Dramatick Poetry was first introduced into <HI>England,</HI>
it never was sunk so deplorably low as it is at present, and
every other Branch of Poetry is declined proportionably;
I mean as far as it has been managed by most of those who
have listed themselves under <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Standard, and who
engage for their Pay. That little that has appeared that
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
has been writ with more Spirit and more Grace than ordi∣nary,
has come, for the most Part, from Volunteers.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> with Submission to your better Judgment, there is
but one Way of reviving the expiring Drama, of restoring
its original Innocence, and of augmenting its ancient Lu∣stre,
and that is by establishing two annual Prizes of two
hundred Pound each; the one for Comedy, the other for
Tragedy, to be given, besides the ordinary Profits of the
Theatre, to him who performs best in each of them, which
is to be decided by Judges appointed on purpose, and
sworn to determine impartially; with this Proviso, that
no Play shall be received, that shall be judged to be ever
so little offensive to good Manners; and that every Play
shall be rejected, whose Author can be proved to have ta∣ken
the least Step towards the forming a Cabal; which
Design I humbly conceive is in your Power to reduce to
Practice, if you would vouchsafe to recommend it to the
Government, or to a Number of Gentlemen who may be
every way qualify'd to engage in so good a Cause.</P>
<P>Several Causes may be assigned of the Decay of Dra∣matick
Peotry, as the <HI>Italian Opera,</HI> which never was e∣stablished
in any Country, but it immediately debased the
Poetry of that Nation: The Strangers who have been in∣troduced
among us, by several great Events, as the <HI>Revo∣lution,</HI>
the <HI>Union,</HI> the <HI>Hanover Succession,</HI> who not under∣standing
our Language, have been very instrumental in
introducing Sound and Show; the new Gentry that has
started up among us, some by the Fortune of War, and
some by the Fortune of <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> who are fond of
their old Entertainments of <HI>Jack-Pudding</HI>; but yet none
of these has done half the Harm that has been done by
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
Cabal. For 'tis in Poetry as 'tis in Politicks, Things go
quite wrong
<Q><L>When Merit pines, while Clamour is prefer'd,</L>
<L>And long Attachment waits among the Herd;</L>
<L>When no Distinction where Distinction's due,</L>
<L>Marks from the Many the superior Few.</L></Q></P>
<P>A Cabal to espouse a Coxcomb, may get him Money, but at the same Time it will procure him Infamy. Wri∣ters
who have Genius will leave the Stage with the ut∣most
Indignation, and every Man who understands it
will have it in Contempt.</P>
<Q><L>The Men who contradict the publick Voice,</L>
<L>And strive to dignify a worthless Choice;</L>
<L>Attempt a Task that on that Choice reflects,</L>
<L>And lend us Light to point out new Defects.</L>
<L>One worthless Man, that gains what he pretends,</L>
<L>Disgusts a Thousand unpretending Friends.</L></Q>
<P>And therefore every Writer who pretends to succeed by
Cabals, ought to be banished from every Theatre. But
to shew the Judgment or the Integrity of our Managers
of the Stage; they have for several Years past rejected
every Play that has not had a Cabal to support it.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> tho' I am sensible that I have already
detain'd you a great deal too long, for which I humbly
and heartily beg your Pardon; yet, before I take Leave
of you, I cannot help acquainting you, that this is the
fourth Time that I have appear'd in Defence of the Stage,
and in this fourth Defence I have no manner of Interest,
but that it has been purely extorted from me by the Force
<PB REF="11"/>
of Truth, and by the Love of my Country. In the for∣mer
Three, I might appear to be maintaining my own In∣terests.
But I have, since the publishing them, been used
with such extreme Ingratitude by the present Managers of
the Playhouse, that I have this Ten Years been obliged,
by the most barbarous Treatment, to take Leave of the
Playhouse for ever.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN you desire to know my Senti∣ments
concerning Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s late Pam∣phlet
against the Stage, you make a Re∣quest,
which 'tis not so easy for me to
satisfy as you may perhaps imagine:
For I really never was so much at a
Loss to know what an Author meant.
Sometimes I am inclined to think him in good earnest;
and sometimes I believe, that there are Grounds to sus∣bect,
that he design'd this whole Pamphlet for nothing
but a spiritual Banter; for there seems to me to be a Ne∣cessity
of believing, either that a Clergyman, as Mr. <HI>Law</HI>
is, should be profoundly ignorant of the sacred Writings,
a Man of Letters of the Nature of Dramatick Poems,
and one who had liv'd long enough in the World to have
some Experience of the present State of Religion, and
Virtue, and Vice, among us; or a Necessity of conclud∣ing,
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
that while Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is declaiming with so much fu∣rious
Zeal against the Stage and Players, he is all that
while acting a Part, and shewing himself a great Come∣dian.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is putting Idolatry and frequenting the
Playhouse upon an equal Foot, he seems to be playing a
Part: for he cannot but know, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was of ano∣ther
Mind, who when he was at <HI>Athens,</HI> the very Source
of Dramatick Poetry, said a great deal publickly against
their Idolatry, but not one Word against their Stage.
When he was afterwards at <HI>Corinth,</HI> as little did he say
against theirs: For St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who was educated in all the
Learning of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who had read all their Poets,
who in the vjth Chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> Ver. 28, quotes <HI>A∣ratus,</HI>
and <HI>Epimenides,</HI> in the first Chapter of his Epistle
to <HI>Titus,</HI> Ver. 10, could not but have read all their noble
Dramatick Poems; and yet has been so far from speaking
one Word against them, that he has made use of them for
the Instruction and Conversion of Mankind. And when
afterwards he wrote his First Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI>
he did not scruple, for their Instruction, to make use of
an <HI>Athenian</HI> Play; for all the World knows, that <HI>Evil
Communications corrupt Good Manners,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 33. is
taken from an <HI>Athenian</HI> Dramatick Poet. Does Mr. <HI>Law</HI>
believe that that Epistle, and consequently that Verse, was
dictated by the Holy Ghost or not? Can Mr. <HI>Law</HI> be∣lieve,
that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was guided by the Spirit of God to
make Choice of that Verse for the Instruction▪ and Con∣version
of the <HI>Corinthians?</HI> And can he believe at the
same Time, that the Theatre, as he more than once de∣clares
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
it, is the Temple of the Devil? If any one should
affirm, That St. <HI>Paul</HI> was guided by the Spirit of God,
to take a Verse from the Temple of the Devil, would it
not be such horrid Blasphemy as would make even the
Blood of the most profligate of all Players to curdle with∣in
the Miscreant's Veins. But if St. <HI>Paul</HI> had in the
least believed, that the <HI>Athenian</HI> Stage was the Sink of
Sin and Corruption, as Mr. <HI>Law</HI> says every Stage is, he
would not have fail'd to reproach them with it, in order
to check the spreading Evil. He who dares talk openly
and boldly against the National Religion of a People,
may very well venture to condemn their Vices and evil
Customs. But St. <HI>Paul</HI> not only says nothing at all
against Dramatick Poetry, but makes use of it for the
Conversion and Reformation of Mankind. Now I would
fain know, if quoting a Dramatick Poet, without giving
the least Caution against the Stage, be not a downright
Approbation of Dramatick Poetry, and establishing the
Stage by no lesser an Authority than that of the Spirit of
God himself.</P>
<P>If we look into the Old Testament, we shall find, that
the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> they and their Reigns,
were declared righteous or wicked, according as those
Kings were Idolaters or not Idolaters; and that no Sin
whatever was reckon'd so abominable as Idolatry. <HI>So∣lomon,</HI>
who had seven hundred Wives, had no less than
three hundred Concubines; and yet when God threatened
to rend Ten Tribes of his Subjects from him, it was only
for his Idolatry, <HI>because he had forsaken God, and had
worshipped Ashtoreth the Goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh</HI><PB N="4" REF="15"/><HI>the God of the Moabites, and Milcom the God of the Chil∣dren
of Ammon,</HI> 1 Kings xj. <HI>For it came to pass, that
when Solomon was old, his Wives turned away his Hear
after other Gods, and his Heart was not perfect with the
Lord his God, as was the Heart of David his Father,</HI>
ibid. Ver. 4. Now <HI>David</HI> committed Adultery with <HI>Bath∣sheba,</HI> and murdered her Husband <HI>Uriah</HI>; yet these Sin
that were of so flagrant a Nature that they brought
a Plague upon <HI>Israel,</HI> were venial, compared to Idolatry.
They brought, indeed, a Plague upon the People, but
they deposed the King from no Part of his Subjects, as
the Idolatry of <HI>Solomon</HI> did his Son <HI>Rehoboam.</HI> In short,
Idolatry is by so much more criminal than the Transgres∣sion
of any other divine Commandment, as the Attempt
to depose a King and to set up a Pretender, is a Crime
of a higher Nature than the Breach of any other human
Law.</P>
<P>As it is hard to imagine, that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> should be ig∣norant
of what has been said above, it gave me just Cause
to suspect his Sincerity: But when I came to the Passage
which he quotes from Archbishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> in the 38th
Page of his Pamplet, I found that he prevaricated
so vilely in it, that the Hypocrisy became immediately ma∣nifest:
For he has omitted the former Part of the Passage,
because it makes directly against him. It is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>To speak against them</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> Plays) <HI>in general, may
be thought too severe, and that which the present Age cannot
so well brook, and would not perhaps be so just and reason∣able,
because it is very possible they might be so framed, and</HI><PB N="5" REF="16"/>
<HI>governed by such Rules, as not only to be innocent and di∣verting,
but instructive and useful, to put some Vices and
Follies out of Countenance, which cannot perhaps be so de∣cently
reproved, nor so effectually exposed and corrected any
other Way.</HI> All this, as I have said above, he has pur∣posely
omitted, because it makes point blank against him.</P>
<P>For after he has told us, in this blessed Pamphlet, <HI>That
the Playhouse is the Temple of the Devil, a more delightful
Habitation for him than ever any Temple that he had in the
Heathen World, where Impurity and Filthiness, immodest
Songs, prophane Rants, Lust, and Passions, entertain the
Audience, a Place, the peculiar Pleasure of the Devil, where
all they who go, yield to the Devil, go over to his Party, and
become Members of his Congregation, where all the Laughter
is not only vain and foolish, but that it is a Laughter among
Devils; that all who are there, are upon prophane Ground,
and hearing Musick in the very Porch of Hell.</HI> After he
has bestow'd all this fine Language upon it, and all these
fragrant Flowers of Rhetorick, he assures us, that the
Playhouse is all that he has said, not thro' any accidental
Abuse, as any innocent or good Thing may be abused,
but by its genuine Hellish Nature; which is directly con∣trary
to what the foremention'd illustrious Prelate has said.
Mr. <HI>Law</HI> says, that every Entertainment of the Stage is
in its Nature unlawful, abominable, and infernal. The
Archbishop assures us, that the Entertainments of the
Stage may be so managed, as not only to be innocent,
but useful and instructive; nay, that they may even be∣come
necessary for the exposing some certain Follies, and
the correcting some certain Vices.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="17"/>
As Mr. <HI>Law</HI> has shewn his Want of Sincerity in the
foresaid Quotation, he gives us great Reasons to suspect
it in his Invectives against the Drama. For 'tis hard to
conceive, that a Man of Letters should be so ignorant of
the Nature of a legitimate Dramatick Poem, as those In∣vectives
suppose him; for 'tis such only that we pretend
to defend, and abhor the Productions of ignorant and
impure Poetasters as much as he does. 'Tis hard to con∣ceive,
that a Man who has read the Classicks, should not
know that a legitimate Dramatick Poem, either of the
Comick or Tragick Kind, is a Fable, and as much a Fa∣ble
as any one of <HI>Aesop</HI>'s, agreeing in Genus, and differ∣ing
only in Species. <HI>Terence</HI> has told him in almost every
one of his Prologues, that every Comedy is a Fable;
and he begins his very first to <HI>Andrea</HI> with it.
<Q><L>Poeta cum primum animum ad scribendum appulit,</L>
<L>Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari,</L>
<L>Populo ut placerent quas fecisset Fabulas.</L></Q>
And <HI>Horace</HI> tells us the same Thing concerning Tragedy,
more than once or twice:
<Q><L>Neve minor quinto, neu sit productior actu</L>
<L>Fabula. <BIBL>De Arte Poet.</BIBL></L></Q>
And we find in the same Treatise;
<Q><L>Interdam speciosa locis, morataque recte</L>
<L>Fabula.</L></Q>
And likewise again;
<Q><L>Nec Quodcunque volet poscat sibi Fabula credi.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Law</HI> cannot but know, that the Instruction by
Fables and Parables, which mean the same Thing, was
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
mightily in Use among the wise Ancients, and especially
among the sacred Writers; that we have an Example of
it, of about three thousand Years standing, in the Parable
of <HI>Jothan.</HI> And that <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who best knew the
Nature of Men, made use of Fables or Parables, as most
proper at the same Time, both to please, and instruct, and
perswade. For a Fable is a Discourse most aptly con∣trived
to form the Manners of Men by Instructions dis∣guised
under the Allegory of an Action. And therefore
he could not chuse but know, that every legitimate Dra∣matick
Poem, either of the Comick or Tragick Kind, is not
a mere Diversion, as he pretends, but a philosophical and
moral Lecture, in which the Poet is Teacher, and the
Spectators are his Disciples, as <HI>Horace</HI> insinuates in the
three following Verses:
<Q><L>Nec minimum meruere Decus vestigia Graeca</L>
<L>Ausi deserere &amp; celebrare Domestica Facta</L>
<L>Vel qui Praetextas, vel qui docuere togatas.</L></Q>
And knowing all this, he could not but know that 'tis
very hard, if not very extravagant, to put the frequenting
moral Lectures upon the same Foot with Idolatry.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Law</HI> has read either <HI>Aristotle</HI> or any of his In∣terpreters,
as 'tis hard to imagine that he should think
himself qualified to write against the Stage if he had read
none of them, he cannot but know, that as the Action of
a Dramatick Fable is universal and allegorical, the Chara∣cters
are so likewise. For as when <HI>Aesop</HI> introduces a
Horse, or a Dog, or a Wolf, or a Lion, he does not pre∣tend
to shew us any singular Animal, but only to shew the
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>
Nature of that Creature, as far as the Occasion where it
appears admits of; so when a Dramatick Poet sets before
us his Characters, he does not pretend to entertain us
with particular Persons, tho' he may give them particular
Names; but proposes to lay before us general and alle∣gorical
Fantoms, and to make them talk and act as Per∣sons
compounded of such and such Qualities, would talk
and act upon like Occasions, in order to give proper In∣structions.</P>
<P>Now as a Dramatick Fable is a Discourse invented to
form the Manners by Instructions disguised under the Al∣legory
of an Action, it follows, that in a Dramatick Fa∣ble
for the proving the Moral, 'tis as necessary to intro∣duce
vicious as virtuous Characters, and to make them
speak and act, as all Persons compounded of their Qua∣lities
would be obliged by Nature to speak and act upon
the like Occasions; as <HI>Aesop,</HI> for the Sake of his Morals,
does not only introduce innocent and peaceable Creatures,
as Horses, and Sheep, and Cows, and Dogs; but like∣wise
noxious and violent ones, as Lions and Bears, and
Wolves, and Foxes: But the Poet at the same time ought
to take care that the Vices should be shewn after such a
Manner, as to render them odious or ridiculous, and
not agreeable or desirable; and that the Reader should
reap no Pleasure from the Agreeableness of the Vices, but
only from a just Imitation of Nature.</P>
<P>I make no Doubt, Sir, but that I have said enough to
satifie you or any of your Friends to whom you may
happen to shew this Letter, that as every true Dramatick
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
Poem is a Fable as much as any one of <HI>Aesop</HI>'s; it has in
its Nature a direct Tendency to teach moral Virtue, and
can therefore never be contrary to a Christian Temper and
Cirit, which, where-ever it is, incites us to good Works,
that is, to the Performance of moral Duties. But there is
every Jot as much Difference between a true Dramatick
Poem, and the Production of an ignorant obscene Poe∣taster,
as there is between two religious Books, the <HI>Bible</HI>
and the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> Now will Mr. <HI>Law</HI> affirm, that because
the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is full of egregious Falshoods, and of mon∣strous
Fanatick Extravagancies, therefore we ought not
to read the <HI>Bible?</HI> It belongs to none but to an Atheist,
or some other unbelieving Sceptick, to make such a Con∣clusion.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> As 'tis hard to conceive that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> should be
ignorant of what we have said above, both concerning the
sacred Writings, and the Nature of a Dramatick Poem;
and equally hard, if he is not ignorant, to believe him a
Writer of Sincerity and Integrity; so it seems to be as
hard to conceive, that a Man of his Years, and conse∣quently
of his Experience, should be utterly a Stranger
to the present State of Religion, and Virtue and Vice, a∣mong
us; or that, if he is not a Stranger to it, he should
be capable of writing so malicious or so erroneous a Trea∣tise
as that which he has lately publish'd against the Stage.</P>
<P>Before I come to speak of the present State of Religion
among us, I desire Leave to translate a Passage from <HI>Da∣cier</HI>'s
Preface to his excellent Comment on <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Art
of Poetry.</HI> If the Quotation appears to be of more than
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
ordinary Length to you, I comfort my self with this Re∣flection,
that you will attend to an Author of more than
ordinary Learning and Judgment, and who can speak s
much better in this Cause than myself.</P>
<P>'Poetry, says that most judicious Critick, is an Art
which was invented for the Instruction of Mankind, and
an Art which is by Consequence useful. 'Tis a Truth
acknowledg'd by all the World, that every Art is in
itself good, because there is none whose End and Design
is not so: But as it is no less true, that Men are apt to
abuse the very best Things, and to pervert the very best
Designs, that which was at first invented as a wholsome
Remedy, may afterwards become a very dangerous Poison.
I am obliged to declare, then, that in what I say of
Tragedy, I speak not of corrupted Tragedy: For'tis
not in Works that are deprav'd and vicious that we are
to search for the Reason and the Design of Nature, but
in those which are sound and intire; when I say this
speak of ancient Tragedy, of that which is conformable to the Rules of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> which I dare pronounae
to be the most useful and most necessary of all Diver∣sions
whatever.'</P>
<P>'If it were in our Power to oblige all Men to follow
the Precepts which the Gospel lays down, nothing could
be more happy for Mankind. In living conformably to
them, they would find true Repose, solid Pleasure, and
a sure Remedy for all their Infirmities; and they might
then look upon Tragedy as a useless Thing, and which
would be infinitely below them. How could they look
upon it in any other Light, since the Heathens themselves
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
beheld it in the very same, as soon as they had embraced
the Study of Philosophy. They confess, that if People
could be always nourish'd with the solid Truths of Phi∣losophy,
the Philosophers had never had Recourse to
Fables, in order to give them Instruction. But as so
much Corruption could not bear so much Wisdom, the
Philosophers were obliged to look for a Remedy for the
Disorder which they saw in Mens Pleasures; for which
they invented Tragedy, and they offered it to the World,
not as the most excellent Thing of which Men could
make their Employment and their Study, but yet as a
Means to correct those Excesses, in which they were
wont to be plunged at their solemn Feasts; and to ren∣der
those Diversions useful to them, which Custom and
their Weakness had render'd necessary, and their Cor∣ruption
very dangerous.'</P>
<P>'What Men were formerly, they are To-day; and what
they are To-day, they will be hereafter; they have the
same Passions which they always had, and run with the
same Eagerness after Pleasure. To undertake to reduce
them in this Condition by the Severity of Precepts, is
endeavouring to put a Bridle on a mad Horse in the
greatest Rapidity of his Course. In the mean time,
there is no Middle; Men will fall into the most criminal
Excesses, unless we find Pleasures for them which are
wise and regular. 'Tis some Degree of Happiness, that
a Remnant of Reason inclines them to love such Diver∣sions
as are consistent with Order, and such Amuse∣ments
as are not incompatible with Truth. And I am
persuaded, that we are obliged in Charity to make our
Advantage of this Inclination, that we may not give
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
time to Debauchery entirely to quench that Spark of
right Reason which still may be seen to glimmer in them.
We prescribe to distemper'd Persons; and Tragedy is the
only Remedy, from which, in their present Condition,
they can reap any Advantage; for 'tis the only Diversion
in which they can find the Profitable united with the
Pleasant.'</P>
<P>Thus far Monsieur <HI>Dacier.</HI> And here, <HI>Sir,</HI> I beg Leave
to observe, that, notwithstanding our Reformation, we
have as few Persons here in <HI>England</HI> who have the true
Spirit of Christianity in them, as there are in <HI>France:</HI>
But there is this Difference between them and us; In
<HI>France,</HI> all own themselves Christians publickly; none of
them dare renounce the Name, tho' few of them are the
Thing: But among us, How many open Dissenters are
there from Christianity itself? How many Atheists? How
many Deists? How many Free-thinkers of a Thousand
Kinds? who all of them refuse to join in our sacred Rites;
some of them, as the Atheists, believing them to be sens
less∣and ridiculous; and others, as the Deists, esteeming
them to be blasphemous and idolatrous. Then what
School of publick Virtue and of publick Spirit have we
for too great a Part of our Youth, but our Theatres
only?</P>
<P>'Tis very strange that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> should be so ignorant
of the present State of Religion among us, as not to fore∣see that the wild Enthusiasm, and the spiritual Fanatical
Rant, which abounds so much in his late Pamphlet, would
afford Matter of Scorn and Laughter to Infidels and Free∣thinkers
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
of all Sorts, and render our most sacred Religion
still more contemptible among them.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Law</HI> says, in the 16th Page of his Pamphlet,
that <HI>It cannot be doubted by any one, that the Playhouse is
a Nursery of Vice and Debauchery, and that the Effect it
has upon Peoples Manners is as visible as the Sun at Noon</HI>;
he seems to know as little of the present State of Vice
among us, as he pretends to do of Religion. The pre∣sent
reigning Vices of the Town, are Drinking, Gaming,
Cursing, Swearing, Prophaness, Corruption of all Sorts,
as Bribing, Tricking, Oppression, Cheating, Whoring and
execrable Sodomy. And Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> forsooth, has the Face
to tell the World, that the Playhouse encourages all these;
that it is the Sink of Corruption and Debauchery; and
that that is not the State of it thro' any accidental Abuse,
but that Corruption and Debauchery are the truly natural
and genuine Effects of the Stage-Entertainment, that is,
of any Stage-Entertainment. Now to shew the Folly and
the Arrogance of these Assertions, let us consider these
Vices one by one.</P>
<P>First then; Does the Theatre encourage Drunkenness?
No; it neither does nor can encourage it: To shew it,
is enough to render it odious or ridiculous. To shew a
Man drunk, is to shew a Fool or a Madman, in whom
the Creator's Image is for a Time intirely defaced, and
who, while he continues in that State, stands in need of a
Guardian. Besides, nothing is more certain, than that
brutal Vice rages most in the Scum and Off-scowring of
the People, who neither have nor ever had the least Com∣munication
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
with the Playhouse. 'Tis true, Men of Thought
may be sometimes drawn into it, but they naturally hate
it; for Drunkenness is a mortal Enemy to Thought, and
consequently Thought to that.</P>
<P>Does the Playhouse encourage Gaming? So far from
that, that Gaming has increased ten-fold, since <HI>Collier</HI>'s
Books against the Stage were published; and since when,
whole Plays have been writ to shew it dangerous and de∣structive,
to shew the unspeakable Harm it does to both
Sexes, and particularly to the Women; <HI>to shew that Gam∣ing,
by giving Men a Privilege of being familiar with, and
sometimes rude to Women, removes that Awe which Nature
has placed between the Sexes, as the strongest Bulwark of
Chastity; that when a young Lady, even of the strictest, the
most unblemish'd Honour, loses a Sum of Money, which she
dares not own to her Relations, and which she cannot pay
without them, and loses it to an agreeable young Fellow, who
perhaps loves her, and has a secret Design upon her, she finds
a Temptation that trys her utmost Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>Does the Playhouse encourage Swearing and Cursing?
Both Reason and Experience assure us that it does not.
They who walk the Streets in the West End of the Town
may be sufficiently convinced, that it rages most in the
Lees of the People, who never knew what a Playhouse was.
It infects even their Wives and their Children, as it very
rarely does those of the better Sort. As common Swearing
is a foolish brutal Vice, that brings neither Pleasure nor
Profit with it, and is the Result of want of Thought; it
follows, that the foolish brutal Part of the People must be
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
most infected with it. Of the Women that frequent the
Playhouse, few are addicted to it but the common Strum∣pets;
and of the Men, none but Bullies, Rakes, and gid∣dy
Coxcombs. If a Comick Poet draws any of these, in
order to correct and amend them, he is obliged to shew
them sometimes Swearing, or he leaves out one of their
Characteristicks. But he cannot fail of shewing that very
Quality either odious or ridiculous, when it appears in
Persons who are themselves both the one and the other.
And if he shews it either odious or ridiculous, that surely
will invite none of the Audience to imitate it.</P>
<P>We equally deny, that the Playhouse encourages any
other Sort of Prophaness. But as a Play is a Fable, that is, a
Composition of Truth and Fiction (as we have observed
above;) as the Action is feigned and the Moral true; as
Characters are necessary for the carrying on the Action, and
or proving the Moral, and vicious Characters as necessary,
and perhaps sometimes more necessary, than are the good
ones; as to shew vicious Characters, and to expose them,
'tis absolutely necessary to put vicious Sentiments into
their Mouths, it follows, that the most criminal Sentiments,
and the most violent Passions, are allowable in vicious and
violent Characters; the most ungovern'd Fury, and the
most outragious Blasphemy itself, not excepted; provided
they are adapted to the Character and the Occasion, and
the Character and the Occasion are necessary for the Moral.
<HI>Virgil</HI> has every where shewn <HI>Mezentius</HI> a Contemner of
the Gods, and a Blasphemer of them; yet we never heard
that the most bigotted of his Cotemporaries ever accused
<HI>Virgil</HI> upon that Account. <HI>Milton,</HI> in the second Book of
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>
<HI>Paradice lost,</HI> makes the Devils, in their infernal Council,
blaspheme in a most outragious Manner; and yet, as they
speak agreeably to their Characters and the Occasion, no
Man has ever been so weak or so unjust, as to accuse <HI>Mil∣ton</HI>
for that Blasphemy, or to give all his Readers to the
Devil for being entertained with it. On the contrary, all
Men of good Understanding, and good Taste, have been
peculiarly charm'd with that very Book, as one of the most
beautiful of that admirable Poem. <HI>Cowley</HI> makes not only
the Devil, but <HI>Goliah</HI> blaspheme;
<Q><L>Thus he blasphem'd aloud; The Hills around,</L>
<L>Flatt'ring his Voice, restor'd the dreadful Sound.</L></Q>
and yet has been never blamed for it. The Book of <HI>Job</HI>
is canonical, and is firmly believed to have been writ by
divine Inspiration. Tho' it is full of uncharitable Judg∣ments,
and is not free from Blasphemy, yet the Instructions
which that divine Parable or Fable gives, proceed in a
great measure from that very Blasphemy, and those uncha∣ritable
Judgments. But now, if a Poet is allow'd to put
Blasphemy into the Mouth of one of his Characters, pro∣vided
he takes care to punish him for it, he is certainly at
Liberty to do the like by any inferior Prophaness.</P>
<P>The Three Nonjuring Priests who have attack'd the
Stage, have made such a Noise about nothing as Propha∣ness;
it sometimes drops three or four Times in one
Page from their tautologous Pens; and they have chiefly
accused our Comedies for it: The Unreasonableness of
which may appear from hence, that all our true Comedies
are but Copies of the foolish or vicious Originals of the
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
Age. Certainly never Man knew what a Comedy was
better than did <HI>Moliere.</HI> Now when in the Critic of the
<HI>Ecole des Femmes,</HI> he is endeavouring to prove, by the
Mouth of <HI>Dorante,</HI> that Comedy is harder to write than
Tragedy, he gives the following Reason for it: <HI>Lors que
vous peignez des Heros, vous faites ce que vous voulez;
ce sont des Portraits a plaisir, ou l'ou ne cherche de ressem∣blance;
et vous n'avez qu'a suivre les Traits d'une Ima∣gination
qui se donne l'essor, et qui souvent laisse le vrai pour
atraper le</HI> Merveilleux. <HI>Mais lors que vous peignez les Hom∣mes,
il faut peindre d'apres Nature; on veut qui ces Portraits
ressemblent, et vous n'avez rien fait si vous n'y faites recon∣noitre
le Gens de votre Siecle.</HI> That is to say; When you
draw Heroes, you are at your own Liberty; those are
Pictures at the Painter's Pleasure, in which no Body looks
for Likeness; and you have nothing to do but to indulge
the Flight of a soaring Imagination. But when you paint
Men, you must draw after Nature; the World expects
that those Pictures should be like; and you have done
nothing at all, unless you shew your Readers or your
Spectators the People of the Age you live in.</P>
<P>Now with Regard to Prophaness, our Comedies are the
faintest Copies in the World, and you may often hear more
Prophaness in one Night's Conversation at a Tavern or an
Eating-house, than you shall hear from the Stage in a
year. For Atheists, Deists, Arians, and Socinians, are
wont to say at their private Meetings, what no one dares
to pronounce on the Stage. Now are not these Nonjuring
Priests either very wise, or very conscientious Persons? Our
Comedies are but Copies of the foolish and vicious Origi∣nals
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
of the Age; and 'tis the Business of the Copies to
expose, and satyrize, and ridicule those foolish and those
vicious Originals. Now these Nonjuring Priests having
nothing to say against those foolish and those vicious Ori∣ginals,
which most certainly corrupt and debauch the Age,
make it their Business to fall foul on the Copies, which
chastise, and satyrize, and ridicule the Originals.</P>
<P>What I have said of the Stage with Relation to Pro∣phaness,
is in Proportion true, with Regard to all other
Vices. Now since our Comedies are but Copies of the fool∣ish
and the vicious Originals of the Age in which we live,
and Copies which do by no means come up to the Ori∣ginals,
I appeal to all the World, if it does not unanswer∣ably
follow from what I have said, that the Originals of
the Age debauch the Stage, by which latter, the Age never
possibly can be debauched. The Stage was establish'd in
<HI>England</HI> towards the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
Reign; whereas the Manners of the People continued ge∣nerally
sound till beyond the Middle of the last Century▪
And the Manners of the People continuing generally sound,
the Stage remain'd generally chaste: But at the Restora∣tion
of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, the Court returning from a∣broad,
corrupted by foreign Luxury, quickly debauch'd
the Town; and the Court and the Town jointly endea∣vour'd
to debauch the Stage, because our Comick Poets
were obliged to copy their lewd Originals, in order to ex∣pose
and reform them.</P>
<P>As for Corruption of any Sort, whether it be Tricking,
Oppressing, Bribing, Sharping, Cheating, the true Poet,
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> perfectly free from all Avarice, is least of all ad∣dicted
to it.</P>
<Q><L>—Vatis Avarus.</L>
<L>Non temere est animus, versus amat, hoc studet unum</L>
<L>Detrimenta, fugas servorum, incendia ridet;</L>
<L>Non fraudem socio, puerove incogitat ullam</L>
<L>Pupillo; <BIBL>Horace Epist. ad Augustum.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>Their usual Poverty is a signal Proof of this: For as the
Love of Money is the Source of all Corruption, he who
despises Gold, is above all the Vices that attend it. And
Poverty attended with great Parts, may very well pass for
a pretty sure Sign of Honesty. A Dramatick Poet there∣fore
being averse from all Corruption himself, if ever he
describes any Kind of it, is sure to make it both odious
and ridiculous.</P>
<P>I come now to almost the only Charge against the Stage
which seems to have any thing of real Weight in it, and
that is, That it excites in Mens Minds the natural Love
of Women. And here by this Charge may be meant two
Things; the one is, That it excites in Men a Desire to
the unlawful Enjoyment of Women; the other is, That it
inclines them to that violent Passion of Love, which is
sometimes between the two Sexes.</P>
<P>As to the first Part of the Charge, that it excites in
Men a Desire to the unlawful Enjoyment of Women; if
there are any Passages in our Plays that are chargeable
with that Guilt, or that defile the Imaginations of an Au∣dience
with unchast and immodest Images, they are nei∣ther
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
natural to the Drama nor necessary, but flagrant A∣buses
of it, and contrary to the very Design of the Art;
and those Passages ought to be banish'd from the Stage for
ever. And yet I cannot help thinking, that if ever those
Passages could be excusable, they would be so at this Jun∣cture,
when the execrable Sin of Sodomy is spread so
wide, that the foresaid Passages might be of some Use to
the reducing Mens Minds to the natural Desire of Wo∣men.
Let Fornication be ever so crying a Sin, yet So∣domy
is a Crime of a thousand times a deeper Dye. A
Crime that forc'd down supernatural Fire from Heaven, to
extinguish its infernal Flames; a Crime that would have
obliged even righteous <HI>Lot</HI> to prostitute his two chast and
virgin Daughters, in order to prevent it. I cannot here omit
observing one Thing, That this unnatural Sin has very
much increased since <HI>Collier</HI>'s Books were publish'd against
the Stage. There were no less than four Persons con∣demned
for it the last Sessions; and I am inform'd, that
several more have been since apprehended for it: The like
of which was never heard of in <HI>Great Britain</HI> before.</P>
<P>As for the Passion of Love, by which the Hearts of
Men and Women are sometimes mutually and violently in∣clined
to each other; if the Passion is kept within the
Bounds of Nature, if the Object and the Intention of it
is lawful, or if 'tis punish'd when 'tis unlawful, I am of
the Opinion, that it cannot have the least ill Consequence;
'tis certainly a Check upon wandring loose Desires; it gives a
very great and very harmless Pleasure, and has a direct Ten∣dency
to the keeping the two Sexes stedfast and firm to the
natural Love of each other: For not only the Affections of
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>
the Men have wildly wander'd from Nature, as is mani∣fest
to all the World, but not a few of the Women too
have endeavour'd to make themselves the Center of their
own Happiness. St. <HI>Paul</HI> is pleas'd to reprove this unna∣tural
Affection of the <HI>Roman</HI> Dames in the first Chapter
of his Epistle to the <HI>Romans.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is desired to
take Notice, that he lays those unnatural Desires not upon
their going to Plays, but upon their Idolatry; Verse 22,
<HI>Professing themselves to be wise, they became Fools.</HI> Verse
23, <HI>And changed the Glory of the incorruptible God into an
Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four∣footed
Beasts, and creeping Things.</HI> Verse 24, <HI>Wherefore
God also gave them up to Uncleanness, to dishonour their own
Bodies between themselves.</HI> Verse 25, <HI>Who changed the
Truth of God into a Lie, and worshipped and served the
Creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
Amen.</HI> Verse 26, <HI>For this Cause God gave them up to vile
Affections: For even their Women did change the natural
Use into that which is against Nature.</HI> Verse 27, <HI>And like∣wise
the Men, leaving the natural Use of the Women, burned
in their own Lusts one toward another, Men with Men work∣ing
that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that
Recompence of their Errors which was meet.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Law</HI>
may be pleased to observe, that the Apostle here gives us
another signal Proof, that he does not put Idolatry and
going to Plays upon an equal Foot. And here, <HI>Sir,</HI> I de∣sire
Leave to make another Remark, and that is, That of
all the Countries of the Christian World, that Country has
been, is, and is like to be, the most infamous for this ex∣ecrable
Vice, in which Idolatry has set up its Head Quar∣ters.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="33"/>
<HI>Sir,</HI> You are very well acquainted with the exact Judg∣ment
of the late <HI>French</HI> Satyrist, who was an Honour to
<HI>France.</HI> That he was very far from being a Friend to the
Corruption of the Stage, will appear from the following
Passage of the fourth Canto of his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>; where
he is giving his Advice to the Poets who were his Cotem∣poraries.
<Q><L>Que votre ame &amp; vos moeurs peints dans tous vos ouvrages</L>
<L>N'offrent jamais de vous que de nobles Images.</L>
<L>Je ne puis estimer ces dangereux Auteurs,</L>
<L>Qui de l'honneur en vers infames deserteurs,</L>
<L>Trahissant la vertu sur un papier coupable,</L>
<L>Aux yeux de leurs Lectures rendent le vice aimable.</L></Q>
Tho' I know very well, that no one understands this Au∣thor
better than you do; yet as this Letter is to pass thro'
your Hand to the Press, I desire Leave to translate the
Passage, for the Benefit of those who are not used to <HI>French.</HI>
<Q>Let your Soul and your Manners, appearing in your Works
to your Readers, never offer any but noble Ideas of you.
I can have no Esteem for those dangerous Authors, those in∣famous
Deserters of Honour in their Verses, who being Tray∣tors
to Virtue in their guilty Lines, render Vice lovely to the
Eyes of those who peruse them.</Q>
And yet immediately after comes his Approbation of Love
in Dramatick Poems:
<Q><L>Je ne suis pas pourtant de ces tristes Esprits</L>
<L>Qui bannissant l'Amour de tous chastes êcrits,</L>
<L>D'un si riche ornement veulent priver la Scene:</L>
<L>Traitent d'empoisonneurs &amp; Rodrigue &amp; Chimene.</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="34"/>
L'amour le moins honneste exprimé chastement,</L>
<L>N'excite point en nous de honteux movement.</L>
<L>Didon a beau gemir &amp; m'étaler ses charmes;</L>
<L>Je condamne sa faute, en partageant ses larmes.</L></Q><Q>And yet, <HI>says he,</HI> I am none of those splenetick Souls, who banishing Love from all chaste Composures, endeavour to
deprive the Stage of so rich an Ornament. The most disho∣nourable
Love, if 'tis chastly express'd, excites no shameful
Motion in us. In vain does <HI>Dido</HI> lament and groan, exposing
all her Charms to me; I condemn her Conduct at the very
Time that I partake of her Grief.</Q></P>
<P>I now return to the Charge of Hypocrisy; for which
there are very just Grounds of Suspicion from the Stile
and Language of this Pamphlet. For is not this little
Treatise, which is pretended to be writ thro' a Zeal for
the Christian Religion, writ in downright Antichristian Lan∣guage?
Is this Pamplet writ in the Language of Modesty,
of Humility, of Meekness? Is it writ in the attractive
Language of Charity? On the contrary, Does not Mr.
<HI>Law</HI> seem to have taken all his Degrees at a certain Uni∣versity
between the Bridge and the Tower? And as the
Disciples of our Saviour, from Dealers in Fish became the
Apostles of their Master; this false Apostle seems to set
up for Water Doctor, and from a Priest to become a Dealer
in Fish. For he has not only the Tropes, and the Figures,
and all the Rhetorical Flowers, but the very Tautologies
of those obstreperous Dealers in quiet and mute Animals.
For the foresaid obstreperous Dealers, are not contented
with calling Rogue, or Whore, or Bitch, or Villain, once,
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
they will repeat it fifty Times; and their Fellow-Colle∣giate
who disputes with them, will return it fifty-fold.</P>
<P>I desire that you would give me leave to present you
with some of Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s Rhetorical Flowers.</P>
<P>At the Bottom of the second Page of his Pamphlet, he
tells us, That there is more to be said in Behalf of Po∣pery
than of going to Plays. For that is plainly his Mean∣ing,
tho' he disguises it by the Terms that he uses. And
towards the Top of the third Page, he is no less positive,
that God is less displeased with Popery than he is with
going to Plays. It looks as if Mr. <HI>Law</HI> would be very
glad to exchange Plays for Popery.</P>
<P>In all the rest of the second Page, he puts them upon
an equal Foot; and assures us, that the Entertainment of
the Stage is contrary to more Doctrines of Scripture than
the Worship of Images.</P>
<P>What, tho' we grant it; Intemperance in Eating, Drink∣ing,
and Venery, is contrary to more Doctrines of Scrip∣ture,
than is either Murder, or High-Treason; and yet
either Murder or High-Treason singly, is ten Times a
greater Sin than all the forementioned Three together.
Sometimes he is making Idolatry, that is Popery, less
criminal than going to Plays: Sometimes he is for ma∣king
them equal, and endeavouring to revive the old sto∣ical
Opinion, <HI>Omnia peccata sunt aequalia</HI>; All Sins are e∣qual:
A Paradox that would tend to make Christianity as
ridiculous, as it help'd to do <HI>Pagan</HI> Stoicism.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="36"/>
In the first Paragraph of the 4th Page. <HI>You go to hear
Plays you say—I tell you,</HI> says Mr. <HI>Law, you go to hear
Ribaldry and Prophaness; that you entertain your Mind with
extravagant Thoughts, wild Rant, blasphemous Speeches,
wanton Amours, prophane Jests, and impure Passions.</HI> [Ay,
now the Language of the College begins.] And a little
lower, <HI>He who goes to a Play, diverts himself with the
Lewdness, Impudence, Prophaness, and impure Discourses of
the Stage.</HI> And a little lower, in the same Page, <HI>This is
plainly the Case of the Stage; it is an Entertainment that
consists of lewd, impudent, prophane Discourses.</HI> And Pag. 7,
<HI>It is an Entertainment made up of Lewdness, Prophaness,
and all the extravagant Rant of disorder'd Passions.</HI> At the
Top of Page 8. he is endeavouring once more to make
Popery less sinful than going to Plays; and by the same
Piece of spiritual Sophistry, he confirms this religious Lie;
because, forsooth, the Stage, with its <HI>lewd prophane Dis∣courses,</HI>
offends against more Doctrines of plain Scripture
than Popery: Which is proving one gross Piece of Falshood,
by another that is much greater.</P>
<P>About the Middle of the same Page, he brings an Ar∣gument
against the Stage from the Iniquity of the Players,
against whom he inveighs with his usual Sophistry and Un∣charitableness:
Which is full as wise and as just, as it would
be to bring an Argument against the Church, from the Vices
of some spiritual Comedians. <HI>The Players are Men and Wo∣men,</HI>
says he, <HI>equally bold, in all Instances of Prophaness,
Passion, and Immodesty; whose Business,</HI> Pag. 9, <HI>is prophane,
wicked, lewd, and immodest</HI>; and a little lower in the same
Page, <HI>whose Employment is less Christian than that of Robbers.</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
<HI>For he must know very little of the Nature of Religion,</HI> says
Mr. <HI>Law, who can look upon Lust, Prophaness, and disorder'd
Passions, to be less contrary to Religion, than the taking
Money from the right Owner.</HI> Which is directly contrary
to common Sense and to common Utility.</P>
<Q><L>Queis paria esse fere placuit peccata, laborant,</L>
<L>Cum ventum ad verum est: sensus moresque repugnant.</L>
<L>Atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater &amp; aequi. <BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>Page 10, He speaks of <HI>the Blasphemy, Prophaness, Lewdness,
Immodesty, and wicked Rant of Plays.</HI> And a little
lower in the same Page, he mentions <HI>a Collection of all
the wicked, prophane, blasphemous, lewd, impudent, detest∣able
Things that are said in the Playhouse.</HI> And Page 11,
he speaks of the Entertainment of the Stage, <HI>as it consists
of Love-Intrigues, blasphemous Passions, prophane Dis∣courses,
lewd Descriptions, filthy Jests, and all the most ex∣travagant
Rant of wanton profligate Persons of both Sexes;
heating and inflaming one another with all the Wantonness
of Address, the Immodesty of Motion, and the Lewdness of
Thought, that Wit can invent.</HI></P>
<P>And here I desire Leave to say a Word, by the way, in
Defence of Players, whose Profession he very wisely, hu∣manely,
and Christianly, makes as unlawful as that of
Robbers. Is he to be told at this Time of Day, that the
Players say nothing of Themselves? They only speak what
the Poet puts into the Mouths of his universal allegorical
Fantoms; which Fantoms the Players represent. Can this
poor Gentleman be so simple as to believe, that <HI>Reynard,</HI>
<HI>Bruin, Isgrim,</HI> and <HI>Grimalkin,</HI> say really of themselves the
<PB N="27" REF="38"/>
Things that <HI>Aesop</HI> puts into their Mouths? The Players
are only the Poet's Instruments, by which he carries on
his Action, and proves his Moral. If any Musician sings
a treasonable Song, and plays to it at the same time, he
ought to suffer for his Crime; but would you indict the
Fiddle or the Flute upon which the Tune is play'd?</P>
<P>What Turn Mr. <HI>Law</HI> design'd to serve, by being so pro∣fuse
of so much fine Language he best can tell, tho' we
perhaps may guess. But he could never possibly think
of making Poets, or Players, or Spectators, good Chri∣stians,
by railing at them for an Hour together, and treat∣ing
them worse than the great Archangel dared to treat
the Devil, <HI>who durst not bring against him a railing Ac∣cusation,
but only said, The Lord rebuke thee.</HI> If he de∣sign'd
to convert People by such a Proceeding, he might
as well pretend to begin a Friendship with another by abu∣sing
him, and throwing Dirt at him.</P>
<P>But to make some Amends for treating his Fellow-Crea∣tures
with so much Antichristian Language, he uses the
Devil with a great deal of Respect and Civility. For be∣sides
the gentle Terms in which he speaks of him; of his
Honour, of his Glory, of his Joy, his Delight, his Plea∣sure,
his peculiar Pleasure; as if Damnation were an ho∣nourable
and a happy State; besides this, I say, he is
pleased, out of his great Bounty, to settle upon him and
his, to have and to hold for ever, the Freehold and Fee-Simple
of all our Theatres. <HI>One may, with the same As∣surance,
affirm,</HI> says he, <HI>that the Playhouse, not only when
some prophane Play is on the Stage, but in its daily common</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="39"/>
<HI>Entertainments, is as certainly the House of the Devil, as
the Church is the House of God,</HI> Page 12. And a little low∣er
in the same Page, <HI>The Manner and Matter of Stage-En∣tertainments,
is as undeniable a Proof, and as obvious to
common Sense, that the House belongs to the Devil, and is
the Place of his Honour, as the Matter and Manner of
Church Service prove that the Place is appropriated to God.</HI></P>
<P>Now my Opinion is, That if the Devil should once
become the Head-Landlord of our Theatres, he would im∣mediately
turn them into so many <HI>Jacobite</HI> Conventicles:
For those are properly his Houses, those are properly his
Temples. For the Sins which the Theatres are accused
by Mr. <HI>Law</HI> of encouraging, are not the Devil's Sins, but
our own, the Sins of Men and Women. The Devil neither
drinks nor whores, nor games, nor rants, nor gormandizes.
But the Sins which are carried on in a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Conven∣ticle,
are the Devil's own Sins; his two great original
Sins, Lying and Rebellion. There all those false Doc∣trines
are carried on, of Hereditary Right, Divine Right,
Indefeasible Right, Absolute Power, Uncontroulable Pow∣er,
Passive Obedience, Unconditional Obedience; Doc∣trines
invented on purpose to make and flatter Tyrants,
who are the Devil's Viceroys. <HI>For as good Kings are God's
Vicegerents, sure a Tyrant is Hell's Viceroy.</HI> The Place
where the Pretender's Cause is carried on, is properly the
Temple of the Devil, the original Pretender.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Law</HI> affirms, That the Playhouse is the Sink
of Corruption and Debauchery, Page 15, and that this is
not the State of it, thro' any accidental Abuse, as any in∣nocent
<PB N="29" REF="40"/>
or good Thing may be abused, but that Corruption
and Debauchery are the truly natural and genuine Effects
of the Stage Entertainments; is it possible that he can be
so ignorant as he pretends to make himself? Can he be
ignorant, that by affirming this, he contradicts what has
been the common Sense of Mankind for two thousand
Years; and that he contradicts the Opinions and the Judg∣ments
of the greatest, and wisest, and most virtuous Men,
of the greatest, and wisest, and most virtuous Nations,
during that vast Space of Time? If Corruption and
Debauchery were the natural and genuine Effects of The∣atrical
Entertainments; would they have been encouraged
by the great Legislators, the most learned Philosophers,
and the wisest Rulers of the freest States in the World?</P>
<P>No Body knows better than Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> that of all pub∣lick
Diversions, the Drama is the most reasonable, manly,
noble, and instructive Diversion; the excelling in which,
shews the Excellence and the Strength of Genius of that
particular Nation where it appears, and by that Means
advances its Reputation with other Nations, and augments
its Power; and that therefore Dramatick Performances have
been so cherished and esteemed by the wisest Rulers of the
noblest Nations, that they have been maintain'd by the
publick Treasure; and the Magistrate has not thought it
at all below him, to have the Regulation and the imme∣diate
Inspection of it: Which is an undeniable Proof, that
they did not at all mistrust that it was natural to those
Entertainments to corrupt and debauch their People.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="41"/>
The Drama is in itself so excellent, and to excel in it
requires so many great Qualities, that of all the Nations
we hear of among the Ancients, but Two were capable of
proper constant Theatrical Entertainments; and those Two
were the wisest, bravest, and most virtuous of all the Na∣tions;
so famous for their great Actions in War, and so
illustrious for the Arts of Peace, that to know what they
were, is become a principal Part of the Learning of us
Moderns; and 'tis accounted scandalous in a Gentleman
to be ignorant of what they said, and wrote, and did;
and yet to know what their Tragick and Comick Poets
were, and what they wrote, is none of the meanest Branches
of that very Learning.</P>
<P>What Opinion the <HI>Grecians</HI> themselves had of their Drama;
how far they believed their Tragick Poets able to inspire
their Countrymen with the Love of their Country, with the
Love of Liberty, of Virtue, and of true Glory, and with
a magnanimous Contempt of Death for the publick Good,
may be gathered from the unanimous Consent of <HI>Greece,</HI>
and particularly from the Honours done by the <HI>Athenians</HI> to
their Tragick Poets, who made them Governors of Pro∣vinces,
Generals of their Armies, and Guardians of the
publick Liberty. For when the <HI>Athenians</HI> settled a great∣er
Fund for the supporting the Magnificence of their Tra∣gick
Representations, than for the Maintenance of their
Fleets and Armies, we may justly conclude that it was
their Opinion, that their Tragick Poets, by constantly
setting before them the Calamities of Tyrants, defended
them from far more dangerous Enemies than those which
their Armies were sent to encounter, and that was from
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>
their own aspiring Citizens. As no People were ever
more jealous of their Liberties than the <HI>Athenians,</HI> none
ever knew better that Corruption and Debauchery are in∣consistent
with Liberty; and therefore it never in the least
enter'd into the Thoughts of that great People, that Cor∣ruption
and Debauchery were the natural Effects of Dra∣matick
Entertainments.</P>
<P>Nor can it be objected with any manner of Justice, that
it was the Fury of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Populace, running mad
after their Pleasures, that made them so warmly espouse
the Drama. The greatest and the wisest Philosophers of
that renown'd Republick declared most warmly and most
loudly for it. <HI>Aristotle</HI> writ an admirable System of Rules
for the composing Dramatick Poems, with that Right
Hand that has given us so many excellent Lessons of
Morality. And <HI>Socrates,</HI> the wisest and the most virtuous
of all the Philosophers, who made it the whole Business
of his Life to instruct his Countrymen in moral Virtue,
did not think it in the least below his Wisdom and his
Virtue, to assist <HI>Euripides</HI> in the writing his Tragedies.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Romans</HI> did not yield to the <HI>Grecians</HI> in the
Esteem which they had for Dramatick Entertainments, and
the Belief that they were capable of contributing to the
Glory and the Felicity of a mighty State, and to the Glo∣ry
and Felicity of the Authors of them, we may gather
from the Actions of their wisest Statesmen, their greatest
Captains, and their severest Philosophers. Their greatest
Captains and their wisest Statesmen not only encouraged
Dramatick Poems, but vouchsafed to write them them∣selves.
<PB N="32" REF="43"/>
<HI>Scipio,</HI> the wise, the virtuous <HI>Scipio,</HI> writ Come∣dy
with that conquering Hand that won the Empire of the
World at <HI>Zama. Augustus Caesar,</HI> as famous for the Arts
of Peace as his Success in War, renown'd for the wholsome
Laws he enacted, and for his reforming the Manners of
the People, begun the Tragedy of <HI>Ajax,</HI> tho' he could not
finish it; but found it easier to make himself Emperor of
the World, than a great Dramatick Poet. <HI>Cicero,</HI> the Cham∣pion
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Liberties, in twenty Places of his Phi∣losophick
Treatises, quotes the <HI>Roman</HI> Tragick Poets.
And <HI>Seneca,</HI> who thro' the Opinion which <HI>Agrippina</HI> had
of the Strictness and the Severity of his Virtue, was in∣trusted
with the Education of a Prince, upon whose Con∣duct
the Happiness of Mankind depended; <HI>Seneca,</HI> who,
by so many admirable Lessons of moral Virtue, has obliged
all the Lovers of Wit and Virtue for ever, did not think
writing Tragedy an Employment at all below him.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Sir,</HI> I appeal to you, whether it does not logi∣cally
and necessarily follow, from what has been said,
that either Mr. <HI>Law</HI> must believe, that the Great Men a∣mong
the ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> their Captains,
Statesmen, and Philosophers, wanted common Sense; or he
cannot possibly believe, that Corruption and Debauchery
are the natural Effects of Theatrical Entertainments; and
consequently must be guilty of very vile Hypocrisy.</P>
<P>There remains another strong Presumption of Hypocrisy
against Mr. <HI>Law.</HI> For what is Mr. <HI>Law?</HI> And what are
his two Predecessors, <HI>Collier</HI> and <HI>Bedford,</HI> who attack'd the
Stage before him? Why <HI>Jacabite</HI> Nonjuring Parsons all
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>
three of them, who have disown'd our Establish'd Church,
and disown'd our Government. How come they to take
up this great Concern for our Salvation in a Matter about
which all our Pastors, who have the immediate Care of
our Souls, are silent? Have they more Capacity to see the
enormous Crimes of Theaters, and the pretended fatal
Consequences of them, than so many great and good Men,
who have been the exalted Lights of the Church since the
Restoration? No, all the World knows, that there is not
the least Pretence for it, nor the least Comparison. Have
they more true Zeal and Concern for the Christian Reli∣gion?
No, that, as we observed above, is inconsistent
with their Manner of treating us. The Language of <HI>Bil∣lingsgate</HI>
can never be the Language of Charity, nor con∣sequently
of Christianity. Truth has not the impetuous
stormy Air which Mr. <HI>Law</HI> assumes, but comes in the soft
and still Voice, like the God who inspires it; and Truth
detests and abominates the Equivocating and Prevaricating
of Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>But now let us consider the Time that these People have
chose to exert their pretended Zeal. It has been always
when something has been about to be done, which it was
thought might prove favourable to the <HI>Pretender.</HI> Mr.
<HI>Collier</HI> publish'd his <HI>Short View</HI> when <HI>France</HI> declar'd for
the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> upon the Death of <HI>James</HI> II. and his <HI>Dis∣suasive,</HI>
upon the great Storm, when the great Devastation
which that Huricane wrought, had amaz'd and astonish'd
the Minds of Men, and made them obnoxious to melan∣cholly
and desponding Thoughts. I formerly expos'd the
egregious hypocritical Folly of making that Storm a Divine
<PB N="34" REF="45"/>
Judgment upon the Nation for the Enormities of our
Theatres. Mr. <HI>Law</HI> has taken the Opportunity to attack
the Stage, upon the great Preparations which he heard
were making abroad, and which the <HI>Jacobites</HI> flatter'd
themselves were design'd in their Favour. As for Mr.
<HI>Bedford</HI>'s <HI>Serious Remonstrance,</HI> tho' I know nothing of
the Time of publishing it, yet I dare to lay Odds it was
either upon the Duke <HI>D'Aumont</HI>'s being at <HI>Somerset-House,</HI>
or upon the late Rebellion. Now all these Attacks
upon the Stage have been Attacks upon the Government,
and those three worthy Persons seem to me to have been
at the Beck of some certain Superiors, and always ready
at their Command to divert the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
from their real Danger, by giving them Alarms in a wrong
Place.</P>
