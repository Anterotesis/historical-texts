<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Just Concern for Truth, and the First
Principles of the Christian Religion,
was the only Motive that engag'd me
in the Examination of your Lordship's
Docrines in a Former Letter to your Lordship.
And the same Motive, I hope, will be thought
a sufficient Apology for my presuming to give
your Lordship the Trouble of a Second Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Amongst the Vain Contemptible Things,
whereof your Lordship would create an Abhor∣rence
in the Layity, are, the</HI> Trifles <HI>and</HI> Niceties
of Authoritative Benedictions, Absolutions, Excommu∣nications.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preservative, <HI>p.</HI> 98.</NOTE> <HI>Again, you say, that</HI> to expect the
Grace of God from any Hands, but his own, is to
affront him—<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 89.</NOTE>. <HI>And</HI> that all depends upon God
and our selves; That Human Benedictions, Human
Absolutions, Human Excommunications, have nothing
to do with the Favour of God.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is evident from these Maxims (for your
Lordship asserts them as such) that whatever In∣stitutions
are observed in any Christian Society,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
upon this Supposition, that thereby Grace is
conferr'd thro' <HI>Human Hands,</HI> or by the Ministry
of the Clergy, such Institutions ought to be con∣demn'd,
and are condemn'd by your Lordship,
as <HI>trifling, useless, and affronting to God.</HI></P>
<P>There is an <HI>Institution,</HI> my Lord, in the <HI>yet</HI> E∣stablish'd
Church of <HI>England,</HI> which we call <HI>Con∣firmation:</HI>
It is founded upon the express Words
of Scripture, Primitive Observance, and the U∣niversal
Practice of all succeeding Ages in the
Church. The Design of this Institution is, that
it should be a Means of conferring Grace, by the
Prayer and Imposition of the <HI>Bishop's Hands</HI> on
those who have been already Baptized. But yet
against all this Authority, both Divine and Hu∣man,
and the express Order of our own Church,
your Lordship teaches the Layity, <HI>that all Hu∣man
Benedictions are useless Niceties;</HI> and <HI>that to ex∣pect
God's Grace from any Hands but his own, is to
affront him.</HI></P>
<P>If so, my Lord, what shall we say in De∣fence
of the Apostles? We read (<HI>Acts</HI> 8. 14.)
that when <HI>Philip</HI> the Deacon had baptiz'd the <HI>Sa∣maritans,</HI>
the Apostles sent <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to
them, who having pray'd, and <HI>laid their Hands on
them, they receiv'd the Holy Ghost, who before was
fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in
the Name of the Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, several things are here out of Que∣stion;
<HI>First,</HI> That something else, even in the
Apostolical Times, was necessary, besides Bap∣tism,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
in order to qualifie Persons to become com∣pleat
Members of the Body, or Partakers of the
Grace of Christ. They had been baptiz'd, yet
did not receive the Holy Ghost, till the Apo∣stles
Hands were laid upon them. 2<HI>dly,</HI> That
God's Graces are not only confer'd by means
of <HI>Human Hands;</HI> but of some particular Hands,
and not others. 3<HI>dly,</HI> That this Office was so
strictly appropriated to the Apostles, or Chief
Governours of the Church, that it could not
be perform'd by Inspir'd Men, tho' empower'd
to work Miracles, who were of an inferiour
Order; as <HI>Philip</HI> the Deacon. 4<HI>thly,</HI> That the
Power of the Apostles for the Performance of this
Ordinance, was intirely owing to their supe∣riour
Degree in the Ministry; and not to any
extraordinary Gifts they were endow'd with:
For then <HI>Philip</HI> might have perform'd it; who
was not wanting in those Gifts, being himself
an Evangelist, and Worker of Miracles: Which
is a Demonstration, that his Incapacity arose
frorn his inferior Degree in the Ministry.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, are all <HI>Human Benedi∣ctions
Niceties and Trifles?</HI> Are the Means of God's
Grace in his <HI>own Hands alone?</HI> Is it wicked,
and <HI>affronting to God,</HI> to suppose the contrary?
How then comes <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to confer the
Holy Ghost by the Imposition of their Hands?
How comes it, that they appropriate this Of∣fice
to themselves? Is the Dispensation of
God's Grace in his <HI>own Hands alone?</HI> And yet
can it be dispens'd to us by the Ministry of some
Persons, and not by that of others?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Were the Apostles so wicked, as to distinguish
themselves by a Pretence to vain Powers, which
God had reserv'd to himself? And which your
Lordship supposes from the Title of your <HI>Pre∣servative,</HI>
that it is inconsistent with <HI>Common
Sense,</HI> to imagine that God would, or could have
communicated to Men.</P>
<P>Had any of your Lordship's well-instructed
Layity liv'd in the Apostles Days, with what
Indignation must they have rejected this sensless
Chimerical <HI>Claim</HI> of the Apostles? They must
have said, Why do you, <HI>Peter</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> pretend
to this <HI>Blasphemous Power? Whilst we believe
the Gospel, we cannot expect the Grace of God
from any Hands but his own.</HI> You give us the
<HI>Holy Ghost!</HI> You confer the Grace of God! Is
it not impious to think, that <HI>He should make our
Improvement</HI> in Grace depend upon your Mini∣stry;
or hang our Salvation on any <HI>particular</HI>
Order of Clergymen? We know, that God is
Just, and Good, and True, <HI>and that all</HI> depends
upon Him and our selves, and that <HI>Human Be∣nedictions</HI>
are <HI>Trisles.</HI> Therefore whether you
<HI>Peter,</HI> or you <HI>Philip,</HI> or both, or neither of you
lay <HI>your</HI> Hands upon us, we are neither better
nor worse; but just in the <HI>same State of Grace</HI> as
we were before.</P>
<P>This Representation, has not one Syllable in
it, but what is founded in your Lordship's Do∣ctrine,
and perfectly agreeable to it.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
The late most Pious and Learned Bishop
<HI>Beveridge</HI> has these remarkable Words upon <HI>Con∣firmation:</HI>
<Q>How any Bishops in our Age
dare neglect so considerable a Part of their
Office, I know not; but fear, they will have
no good Account to give of it, <HI>when they come
to stand before God's Tribunal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">First Volume of Sermons.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But we may justly, and therefore I hope, with
Decency, ask your Lordship, how you dare per∣form
this Part of your Office? For you have
condemn'd it as <HI>Trifling</HI> and <HI>Wicked;</HI> as <HI>Trifling,</HI>
because it is an <HI>Human Benediction;</HI> as <HI>Wicked,</HI>
because it supposes Grace confer'd by the <HI>Hands
of the Bishop.</HI> If therefore any baptiz'd Persons
should come to your Lordship for Confirmation,
if you are <HI>sincere</HI> in what you have deliver'd,
your Lordship ought, I humbly conceive, to make
them this Declaration.</P>
<Q><P>My Friends, for the sake of <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Or∣der,</HI>
I have taken upon me the Episcopal
Character; and, according to Custom, which
has long prevaild against Common Sence,
am now to lay my Hands upon you: But, I
beseech you, as you have any Regard to the
Truth of the Gospel, or to the Honour of
God, not to imagine, there is any Thing in
this Action, more than an useless empty Ce∣remony:
For if you expect to have any Spi∣ritual
Advantage from <HI>Human Benedictions,</HI> or
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
to receive Grace from the Imposition of a Bi∣shop's
Hands, you affront God, and in effect,
renounce Christianity.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Pray, my Lord consider that Passage in the
Scripture, where the Apostle speaks of</HI> Leaving
the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, and going
on unto Perfection; not laying again the Foundation
of Repentance from dead Works, of Faith towards
God, of the Doctrine of Baptisms, and of Laying on
of Hands, and of the Resurrection of the Dead, and
of eternal Judgment,(<HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 12.)</P>
<P>My Lord, here it is undeniably plain, that
this Laying on of Hands (which is with us
called <HI>Confirmation</HI>) is so fundamental a Part of
Christ's Religion, that it is called one of the
First Principles of the Doctrine of Christ; and
is placed amongst such primary Truths, as the
Resurrection of the Dead, and of Eternal Judg∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>St.</HI> Cyprian <HI>speaking of this Apostolical Im∣position
of Hands, says,</HI> The same is now pra∣ctis'd
with us; they who have been baptiz'd in the
Church, are brought to the Presidents of the Church,
that by our Prayer and Imposition of Hands, they
may receive the Holy Ghost, and be consummated with
the Lord's Seal.</P>
<P>And must we yet believe, that all <HI>Human Be∣nedictions</HI>
are Dreams, and the Imposition of Hu∣man
Hands trifling and useless; and that to
expect God's Graces from them, is to affront
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
him? Tho' the Scriptures expressly teach us,
that God confers his Grace by means of certain
<HI>particular Human Hands,</HI> and not of others; tho'
they tell us, this <HI>Human Benediction,</HI> this Laying
on of Hands, is one of the first Principles of
the Religion of Christ, and as much a Founda∣tion
Doctrine as the Resurrection of the Dead,
and Eternal Judgment; and tho' every Age
since that of the Apostles, has strictly observ'd it
as such, and the Authority of our own Church
still requires the Observance of it?</P>
<P>I come now, my Lord, to another Sacred and
Divine Institution of Christ's Church, which
stands expos'd and condemn'd by your Lord∣ship's
Doctrine; and that is, the <HI>Ordination</HI> of
the Christian Clergy; where, by means of an
Human Benediction, and the Imposition of the
Bishop's Hands, the Holy Ghost is supposed to be
confer'd on Persons towards consecrating them
for the Work of the Ministry.</P>
<P>We find it constantly taught by the Scriptures,
that all Ecclesiastical Authority, and the Graces
whereby the Clergy are qualified and enabl'd to
exercise their Functions to the Benefit of the
Church, are the Gifts and Graces of the Holy
Spirit. Thus the Apostle exhorts the Elders <HI>to
take heed unto the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost
hath made them Overseers,</HI> (Eph. 4. 7.) But how,
my Lord, had the Holy Ghost made them Over∣seers,
but by the Laying on of the Apostles
Hands? They were not immediately call'd by
the Holy Ghost; but being consecrated by <HI>such
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Human Hands</HI> as had been authorized to that pur∣pose,
they were as truly call'd by him, and
sanctified with Grace for that Employment, as
if they had receiv'd an immediate or miraculous
Commission. So again, St. <HI>Paul</HI> puts <HI>Timothy</HI> in
mind, <HI>to stir up the Gift of God that was in him,
by laying on of his Hands,</HI> (2 Tim. 2. 6.)</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, if <HI>Human Benedictions</HI> be
such idle <HI>Dreams</HI> arid <HI>Trifles;</HI> if it be <HI>affronting
to God,</HI> to expect his Graces from them, or
through <HI>Human Hands;</HI> do we not plainly want
new Scriptures? Must we not give up the Apo∣stles
as Furious High-Church Prelates, who a∣spir'd
to presumptuous Claims, and talk'd of
conferring the Graces of God by their own
Hands? Was not this Doctrine as strange and
unaccountable then, as at present? Was it
not as inconsistent with the Attributes and
Sovereignty of God at that time, to have
his Graces pass through other Hands than his
own, as in any succeeding Age? Nay, my
Lord, where shall we find any Fathers or Coun∣cils,
in the Primitive Church, but who own'd
and asserted these Powers? They that were so
ready to part with their Lives, rather than do
the least Dishonour to God, or the Chiristian
Name, yet were all guilty of <HI>this horrid Blasphe∣my</HI>
in imagining that they were to bless in
God's Name; and that by the Benediction and
Laying on of the Bishop's Hands, the Graces of
the Holy Ghost could be confer'd on any
Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
Agreeable to the Sence of Scripture and An∣tiquity,
our Church uses this Form of Ordina∣tion:
<HI>The Bishop laying his Hands on the Person's
Head, saith, Receive the Holy Ghost, for the Office
and Work of a Priest in the Church of God, commit∣ted
unto thee, by the Imposition of our Hands.</HI> From
this Form, it is plain, <HI>First,</HI> that our Church
holds, that the Reception of the Holy Ghost is
necessary to constitute a Person a Christian
Priest. 2<HI>dly,</HI> That the Holy Ghost is confer'd
through <HI>Human Hands.</HI> 3<HI>dly,</HI> That it is by the
Hands of a Bishop that the Holy Ghost is
confer'd.</P>
<P>If therefore your Lordship is right in your
Doctrine, the Church of <HI>England</HI> is evidently
most corrupt. For if it be dishonourable and
affronting to God, to expect his Grace from any
Human Hands; it must of necessity be disho∣nourable
and affronting to him, for a Bishop to
pretend to confer it by his Hands. And can
that Church be any ways defended, that has e∣stablish'd
such an Iniquity by Law, and made
the Form of it so necessary? How can your
Lordship answer it to your Layity, for taking
the Character or Power of a Bishop from such
a Form of Words? You tell them, it is affront∣ing
to God, to expect his Grace from <HI>Human
Hands;</HI> yet to qualifie your self for a Bishoprick,
you let Human Hands be laid on you, after a
manner which directly supposes you thereby re∣ceive
the Holy Ghost! Is it wicked in them to
expect it from <HI>Human Hands?</HI> And is it less so in
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
your Lordship, to pretend to receive it from Hu∣man
Hands? He that believes, it is affronting to
<HI>God,</HI> to expect his Grace from Human Hands,
must likewise believe, that our Form of Ordi∣nation,
which promises the Holy Ghost by the
<HI>Bishop</HI>'s <HI>Hands,</HI> must be also affronting to God.
Certainly, he cannot be said to be very jealous
of the Honour of God, who will submit him∣self
to be made a Bishop by a Form of Words
derogatory, upon his own Principles, to God's
Honour.</P>
<P>Suppose your Lordship was to have been
consecrated to the Office of a Bishop by these
Words; <HI>Take thou Power to sustain all things in Be∣ing
given thee by my Hands.</HI> I suppose, your Lord∣ship
would think it intirely Unlawful to submit
to the Form of such an Ordination. But, <HI>my
Lord, receive thou the Holy Ghost,</HI> &amp;c. is as impious
a Form, according to your Lordship's Doctrine,
and equally injurious to the Eternal Power and
Godhead, as the other. For if the Grace of
God can only be had from <HI>his own</HI> Hands, would
it not be as innocent in the Bishop to say, <HI>Re∣ceive
then Power to sustain all things in Being,</HI> as to
say, <HI>Receive the Holy Ghost, by the Imposition of my
Hands?</HI> And would not a Compliance with ei∣ther
Form be equally unlawful? According to
your Doctrine, in each of them God's Preroga∣tive
is equally invaded; and therefore the Guilt
must be the same.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
It may also well be wonder'd, how your Lord∣ship
can accept of a Character, which is, or
ought to be chiefly distinguish'd by the Exercise
of that Power which you disclaim, as in the
Offices of <HI>Confirmation</HI> and <HI>Ordination.</HI> For, my
Lord, where can be the Sincerity of saying,
<HI>Receive the Holy Ghost by the Imposition of our Hands,</HI>
when you declare it affronting to God, to expect
it from any Hands but his own? Suppose your
Lordship had been preaching to the Layity a∣gainst
owning any Authority in the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI>
and yet should acquiesce in the Conditions of
being made a Bishop in her Name, and by re∣cognizing
her Power: Could such a Submission
be consistent with Sincerity? Here you forbid
the Layity to expect God's Grace from any
Hands but his; yet not only accept of an Of∣fice,
upon Supposition of the contrary Doctrine;
but oblige your self, according to the Sence of
the Church wherein you are ordain'd a Bishop,
to act frequently in direct Opposition to your
own Principles.</P>
<P>So that, I think, it is undeniably plain, that
you have at once, my Lord, by these Doctrines
condemn'd the Scriptures, the Apostles, their
martyr'd Successors, the Church of <HI>England</HI> and
your own Conduct; and have hereby given us
some reason (tho' I wish, there were no Occasion
to mention it) to suspect, whether you, who al∣low
of no other Church, but what is founded
in Sincerity, are your self, really a Member of
any Church.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
I shall now proceed to say something upon
the Consecration of the Lord's Supper; which is
as much expos'd as a <HI>Trifle,</HI> by your Lordship's
Doctrine, as the other Institutions. St. <HI>Paul</HI>
says. <HI>The Cup of Blessing which we bless, is it not
the Communion of the Blood of Christ?</HI> My Lord,
is not this Cup still to be bless'd? Must there not
therefore be such a thing as an <HI>Human Benediction?</HI>
And are Human Benedictions to be all despis'd,
though by them the Bread and Wine become
Means of Grace, and are made the Spiritual
Nourishment of our Souls? Can any one bless
this Cup? If not, then there is a Difference be∣tween
Human Benedictions: Some are authori∣zed
by God, and their Blessing is effectual;
whilst others, only are vain and presumptuous. If
the Prayer over the Elements, and the Conse∣cration,
be only a Trifle and a Dream; and it
be offensive to God, to expect they are conver∣ted
into Means of Grace by an Human Benedi∣ction;
why then did St. <HI>Paul</HI> pretend to bless
them? Why did he make it the Privilege of the
Church? Or, why do we keep up the same
Solemnity? But if it be to be bless'd only by
God's Ministers, then how can your Lordship
answer it to God, for ridiculing and abusing
Human Benedictions; and telling the World,
that a particular Order of the Clergy are not of
any necessity, nor can be of any Advantage to
them. For if the Sacrament can only be bless'd
by God's Ministers; then such Ministers are as
necessary, as the Sacraments themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, the Cup must be bless'd: If you
say, any one may bless it, then, though you
contemn the Benedictions of the Clergy, you
allow of them by every body else: If every bo∣dy
cannot bless it; then, you must confess, that
the Benedictions of some Persons are effectual,
where others are not.</P>
<P>My Lord, the great Sin against the Holy
Ghost, was the Denial of his Operation in the
Ministry of our Saviour. And how near does
your Lordship come to it, in denying the Ope∣ration
of that same Spirit, in the Ministers whom
Christ hath sent? They are employed in the
same Work that he was. He left his Authority
with them; and promis'd, that the Holy Spirit
should remain with them to the End of the
World; that whatsoever they should bind on
Earth, should be bound in Heaven; and what∣soever
they should loose on Earth, should be
loosed in Heaven; that whosoever despises them,
despises Him, and Him that sent him. And yet
your Lordship tells us, we need not to trouble
our Heads about any particular Sort of Clergy;
that all is to be transacted betwixt God and our
selves; that Human Benedictions are infignisi∣cant
Trifles.</P>
<P>But pray, what Proof has your Lordship for
all this? Have you any Scripture for it? Has
God any where declar'd, that no Men on Earth
have any Authority to bless in his Name? Has
he any where said, that it is a wicked, presum∣ptuous
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Thing for any one to pretend to it? Has
he any where cold us, that it is inconsistent with
his Honour, to bestow his Graces by <HI>Human
Hands?</HI> Has he any where told us, that he has
no Ministers, no Embassadors on Earth; but
that all his Gifts and Graces are to be receiv'd
immediately from his own Hands? Have you
any Antiquity, Fathers or Councils on your
side? No: The whole Tenour of Scripture, the
whole Current of Tradition is against you. Your
Novel Doctrine has only this, to recommend it
to the Libertines of the Age, who universally
give into it, that it never was the Opinion of
any Church, or Church-man. It is your Lord∣ship's
proper Assertion, <HI>That we offend God in
expecting his Graces from any Hands but his own.</HI></P>
<P>Now it's strange, that God should be offend∣ed
with his own Methods; or that your Lord∣ship
should find us out a Way of pleasing him,
more suitable to his Nature and Attributes, than
what he has taught us in the Scriptures. I call
them his own Methods: For what else is the
whole <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation, but a Method of
God's Providence; where his Blessings and Judg∣ments
were dispens'd by <HI>Human Hands?</HI> What is
the Christian Religion, but a Method of Salva∣tion,
where the chief Means of Grace are of∣fer'd
and dispens'd by Human Hands? Let me
here recommend to your Lordship, the excellent
Words of a very Learned and Judicious Prelate
on this Occasion.</P>
<Q><P><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
This will have no Weight with any Rea∣sonable
Man, against the Censures of the
Church, or any other Ordinance of the Go∣spel,
that they make the Intervention of o∣ther
Men necessary to our Salvation; since
it has always been God's ordinary Method, to
dispense his Blessings and Judgments by the
Hands of Men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Potter</HI>'s Church-Government, <HI>p.</HI> 336.</NOTE>.</P></Q>
<P>Your Lordship exclaims against your Adver∣saries,
as such Romantick strange sort of Men,
for talking of Benedictions and Absolutions, and
of the Necessity of receiving God's Ordinances
from proper Hands: Yet, my Lord, here is an
Excellent Bishop, against whose <HI>Learnings Judg∣ment</HI>
and <HI>Protestantism,</HI> there can be no Objection;
who says, if a Person have but the <HI>Use of his
Reason,</HI> he will have nothing to object to any
Ordinances of the Gospel, which make the In∣tervention
of other Men necessary towards the
Conveyance of them; since that has always
been God's ordinary Method. The Bishop does
not say, it is necessary, a Man should be a
<HI>Great Divine</HI> to acknowledge it; so he be but a
<HI>Reasonable Man,</HI> he will allow it. Yet your
Lordship is so far from being this <HI>Reasonable Man,</HI>
that you think your Adversaries void both of
Reason and common Sense, for teaching it.
You expressly exclude <HI>All</HI> Persons from having
any thing to do with our Salvation; and say, it
<HI>wholly</HI> depends upon God and our selves.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
You tell us, that <HI>Authoritative Benediction is
another of the Terms of Art used by your Protestant
Adversaries; in which they claim a Right, in one Re∣gular
Succession, of Blessing the People</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 91.</NOTE>. An inge∣nious
Author, my Lord, (in the Opinion of
many, if not of most of your Friends) calls
the <HI>Consecration</HI> of the Elements <HI>Conjuration</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rights of the Christian Church.</NOTE>;
your Lordship calls the <HI>Sacerdotal Benediction</HI> a
<HI>Term of Art;</HI> too plain an Intimation, tho' in
more remote and somewhat softer Terms, that
in the Sence of a <HI>Certain Father</HI> of the Church,
her Clergy are little better than so many Jug∣glers.</P>
<P>Your Lordship says, <HI>If they only meant hereby to
declare upon what Terms God will give his Blessings</HI>
to Christians, <HI>or to express their own hearty Wishes for
them, this might be understood.</HI> So it might, my
Lord, very easily; and, I suppose, every body
understands that they may do this, whether they
be Clergy or Layity, Men or Women: For I
presume, any one may declare what he takes to
be the Terms of the Gospel, and wish that o∣thers
may faithfully observe them. But I hum∣bly
presume, my Lord, that the Good Bishop
above-mention'd, meant something more than
this, when he spake of <HI>Ordinances, which make
the Intervention of other Men</HI> necessary <HI>to our Salva∣tion,
and of God's dispensing his Blessings</HI> in virtue of
them through their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
There is a superstitious Custom (in your
Lordship's Account it must be so) yet remaining
in most Places, of sending for a Clergyman to
minister to sick Persons in imminent Danger of
Death: Even those who have abus'd the Clergy
all their Lives long, are glad to beg their Assist∣ance
when they apprehend themselves upon the
Confines of another World. There is no reason,
my Lord, to dislike this <HI>Practice,</HI> but as it sup∣poses
a Difference between the <HI>Sacerdotal Prayers</HI>
and <HI>Benedictions.</HI> and those of a Nurse.</P>
<P>We read, my Lord, that God would not heal
<HI>Abimelech,</HI> tho' he knew the Integrity of his
Heart, till <HI>Abraham</HI> had prayed for him. <HI>He is a
Prophet,</HI> said God, <HI>he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt
live,</HI> (Gen. 20. 7.)</P>
<P>Pray, my Lord, was not God Just, and Good,
and True, in the Days of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as He is
now? Yet you see, <HI>Abimelech's Integrity</HI> was not
available it self. He was to be pardon'd by
the Prayer of <HI>Abraham;</HI> and his Prayer was effe∣ctual;
and so represented, because it was the
Prayer of a <HI>Prophet.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose, my Lord, that <HI>Abimelech</HI> had said
with your Lordship, <HI>That it is affronting to God,
that we should expect his Graces from any Hands</HI> but
<HI>his own; that all is to be transacted between God and
our selves;</HI> and so had rejected the Prayer of <HI>A∣braham,</HI>
as a mere Essay of <HI>Prophet-Craft;</HI> He had
then acted with as much Prudence and Piety as
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
your Lordship's Layity would do, if you could per∣suade
them to despise <HI>Benedictions</HI> and <HI>Absolutions,</HI>
to regard no <HI>particular sort of Clergy;</HI> but intirely
depend upon God and themselves, without any
other Assistance whatever.</P>
<P>We read also, that <HI>Joshua was full of the Spirit of
Wisdom; for Moses had laid his Hands upon him,</HI>
(Deut. 34. 9.) Was it not as absurd, my Lord, in
the Days of <HI>Joshua,</HI> for <HI>Human Hands</HI> to <HI>bless,</HI> as
it is now? Did there not then lie the same Ob∣jection
against <HI>Moses,</HI> that there does now against
the Christian Clergy? Had <HI>Moses</HI> any more <HI>Na∣tural
Power</HI> to give the Spirit of Wisdom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by
his Hands, than the Clergy have to confer Grace
by theirs? They are both equally weak and in∣sufficient
for these Purposes, of themselves, and
equally powerful when it pleases God to make
them so.</P>
<P>Again, when <HI>Eliphaz,</HI> and his Friends had dis∣pleased
God, they were not to be reconciled to
God by their own Repentance, or transact that
Matter only between God and themselves; but
they were refer'd to apply to <HI>Job. My Servant
Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept,</HI> (Job 42. 8.)
Might not <HI>Eliphaz,</HI> here have said, shall I so far
affront God, as to think I can't be bless'd with∣out
the Prayers of <HI>Job?</HI> Shall I be so weak or
senseless, as to imagine, my own Supplications
and Repentance will not save me; or that I
need apply to any one but God alone, to quail∣fie
me for the Reception of his Grace?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
<HI>Again,</HI> The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, speak
unto Aaron and his Sons, saying, on this wise shall ye
bless the Children of Israel, saying unto them, <HI>The
Lord bless and keep thee,</HI> &amp;c. and I will bless
them, (<HI>Numb.</HI> 6. 22.)</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> The Priests of the Sous of Levi shall come
near; for them hath the Lord thy God chosen to mini∣ster
unto him, and to bless in the Name of the Lord,
(<HI>Deut.</HI> 21. 5.)</P>
<P>Now, my Lord, this is what we mean by the
Authoritative Administrations of the Christian
Clergy; whether they be by way of Benedicti∣on,
or of any other kind. We take them to
be Persons whom God has chosen to minister
unto him, and to bless in his Name. We ima∣gine,
that our Saviour was a greater <HI>Priest and
Mediator</HI> than <HI>Aaron,</HI> or any of God's former
Ministers. We are assur'd,, that Christ sent his
Apostles, as his Father had sent him; and that
therefore they were his true Successors: And
since they did commission others to succeed them
in their Office, by the Imposition of Hands, as
<HI>Moses</HI> commission'd <HI>Joshua</HI> to succeed him; the
Clergy who have succeeded the Apostles, have
as Divine a Call and Commission to their Work,
as those who were call'd by our Saviour; and are
as truly his Successors, as the Apostles themselves
were.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
From the Places of Scripture above mention∣ed,
it is evident; and indeed, from the whole
Tenour of Sacred Writ, that it may consist with
the Goodness and Justice of God to depute Men
to act in his Name, and be ministerial towards the
Salvation of others; and to lay a Necessity upon
his Creatures of qualifying themselves for his Fa∣vour,
and receiving his Graces by the Hands and
Intervention of mere Men.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, if there be now any Set of
Men upon Earth, that are more peculiarly God's
Ministers, than others; and thro whose Admini∣strations,
Prayers, and Benedictions, God will
accept of returning Sinners, and receive them to
Grace; you have done all you can, to prejudice
People against them: You have taught the Layi∣ty,
that all is to be transacted between God and
themselves; and that they need not value any
particular sort of Clergy in the World.</P>
<P>I leave it to the Great Judge and Searcher of
Hearts, to judge, from what Principles, or up∣on
what Motives your Lordship has been induc'd
to teach tesethings: But must declare, that
for my own part, if I had the greatest Ha∣tred
to Christianity, I should think, it could not
be more express'd, than by teaching what your
Lordship has publickly taught. If I could re∣joice
in the Misery and Ruin of Sinners, I should
think it sufficient Matter of Triumph, to drive
them from the Ministers of God, and to put
them upon inventing new Schemes of saving
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
themselves, instead of submitting to the ordinary
Methods of Salvation appointed by God.</P>
<P>It will not follow from any thing I have said,
that the Layity have lost their Christian Liber∣ty;
or that no body can be sav'd, but whom the
Clergy please to save; that they have the arbi∣trary
Disposal of Happiness to Mankind. Was
<HI>Abimelech</HI>'s Happiness in the Disposition of <HI>A∣braham,</HI>
because he was to be receiv'd by means
of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Intercession? Or could <HI>Job</HI> damn
<HI>Eliphaz,</HI> because he was to mediate for him, and
procure his Reconciliation to God.</P>
<P>Neither, my Lord, do the <HI>Christian Clergy</HI>
pretend to this despotick Empire over their
Flocks: They don't assume to themselves a Pow∣er
to damn the Innocent, or to save the Guilty:
But they assert a sober and just Right to recon∣cile
Men to God; and to act in his Name, in
restoring them to his Favour. They receiv'd
their Commission from those whom Christ sent
with full Authority to send others, and with a
Promise that he would be with them to the End
of the World. From this they conclude, that
they have his Authority; and that in conse∣quence
of it, their Administrations are necessary,
and effectual to the Salvation of Mankind; and
that none can despise Them, but who despise
Him that sent them; and are as surely out of the
Covenant of Grace, when they leave such his
Pastors, as when they openly despise, or omit to
receive his Sacraments.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
And what is there in this Doctrine, my Lord,
to terrifie the <HI>Consciences</HI> of the <HI>Layity?</HI> What
is there here, to bring the prophane Scandal of
<HI>Priestcraft</HI> upon the <HI>Clergy?</HI> Could it be any
ground of <HI>Abimelech</HI>'s hating <HI>Abraham,</HI> because
that <HI>Abraham</HI> was to reconcile him to God?
Could <HI>Eliphaz,</HI> justly have any Prejudice against
<HI>Job,</HI> because God would hear <HI>Job</HI>'s Intercession
for him? Why, then, my Lord, must the Chri∣stian
Priesthood be so horrid and hateful an In∣stitution,
because the Design of it is to restore
Men to the Grace and Favour of God? Why
must we be abus'd and insulted, for being sent
upon the Errand of Salvation, and made Mini∣sters
of eternal Happiness to our Brethren?
There is a Woe due to us if we preach not the
Gospel, or neglect those ministerial Offices that
Christ has entrusted to us. We are to watch
for their Souls, as those who are to give an Ac∣count.
Why then must we be treated as arro∣gant
Priests, or <HI>Popishly</HI> affected, for pretending
to have any thing to do in the Discharge of our
<HI>Ministry,</HI> with the Salvation of Men? Why
must we be reproach'd with <HI>Blasphemous Claims,</HI>
and <HI>Absurd Senseless Powers▪</HI> for assuming to bless
in God's Name; or thinking our Administrati∣ons
more effectual, than the Office of a common
<HI>Layman?</HI></P>
<P>But farther, to what purpose does your Lord∣ship
except against these Powers in the <HI>Clergy?</HI>
from their <HI>common Frailties</HI> and <HI>Infirmities</HI> with the
rest of Mankind? Were not <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
and the <HI>Jewish</HI> Priests, Men of like Pas∣sions
with us? Did not our Saviour command the
<HI>Jews</HI> to apply to their Priests, notwithstanding
their Personal Faults, because they sat in <HI>Mo∣ses</HI>'s Chair? Did not the Apostles assure their
Followers, that they were Men of like Passions
with them? But did they therefore disclaim
their Mission, or Apostolical Authority? Did
they teach, that their Natural Infirmities
made them less the Ministers of God, or less
necessary to the Salvation of Men? Their Per∣sonal
Defects did not make them depart from the
Claim of those Powers they were invested with,
or desert their Ministry: But indeed, gave St.
<HI>Paul</HI> Occasion to say, <HI>We have this Treasure in Ear∣then
Vessels,</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> this Authority committed to mere
Men) <HI>that the Excellency of it may be of God, and
not of Men.</HI> The <HI>Apostle</HI> happens to differ very
much from your Lordship. He says, such weak
Instruments were made use of, that the Glory
might redound to God? Your Lordship says,
to suppose such Instruments to be of any Benefit
to us, is to lessen the Sovereignty of God, and in
consequence, his Glory.</P>
<P>Your Lordship imagines, you have sufficiently
destroy'd the <HI>Sacerdotal Powers,</HI> by shewing, that
the <HI>Clergy</HI> are only Men, and subject to the
common Frailties of Mankind. My Lord, we
own the Charge; and don't claim any <HI>Sacerdo∣tal
Powers</HI> from our Personal Abilities, or to ac∣quire
any Glory to our selves. But, weak as we
are, we are God's Ministers; and if we are ei∣ther
afraid or asham'd of our Duty, we must pe∣rish
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
in the Guilt. But is a <HI>Prophet</HI> therefore
proud, because he insists upon the Authority of
his Mission? Can't a Mortal be God's Messen∣ger,
and employ'd in his Affairs, but he must be
insolent and assuming, for having the Resolution
to own it? If we are to be reprov'd, for preten∣ding
to be God's Ministers, because we are but
Men, the Reproach will fall upon Providence;
since it has pleased God, chiefly to transact his
Affairs with Mankind, by the Ministry of their
Brethren.</P>
<P>Your Lordship has not One Word from Scrip∣ture
against these <HI>Sacerdotal Powers;</HI> no Proof,
that Christ has not sent Men to be effectual Ad∣ministrators
of his Graces: You only assert, that
there can be no such Ministers, because they are
mere Men.</P>
<P>Now, my Lord, I must beg leave to say, that
if the Natural Weakness of Men makes them in∣capable
of being the Instruments of conveying
Grace to their Brethren; if the Clergy can't
be of any Use or Necessity to their Flocks, for
this Reason; then it undeniably follows, that
there can be no <HI>positive Institutions</HI> in the Chri∣stian
Religion, that can procure any Spiritual
Advantages to the Members of it; then the Sa∣craments
can be no longer any Means of Grace.
For, I hope, no one thinks, that Bread and Wine
have any natural Force or Efficacy, to convey
Grace to the Soul. The Water in Baptism has the
common Qualities of Water, and is destitute of
any intrinsick Power to cleanse the Soul, or
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
purifie from Sin. But your Lordship will not say,
because it has only the common Name of Water,
that therefore it cannot be a Means of Grace.
Why then may not the Clergy tho' they have
the common Nature of Men, be constituted by
God, to convey his Graces, and to be ministe∣rial
to the Salvation of their Brethren? Can God
consecrate inanimate Things to Spiritual Pur∣poses,
and make them the Means of Eternal
Happiness? And is Man the only Creature that
he can't make subservient to his Designs? The
only <HI>Being</HI> who is too Weak for an Omnipotent
God to render effectual towards attaining the
Ends of his Grace?</P>
<P>Is it just and reasonable, to reject and despise
the <HI>Ministry</HI> and <HI>Benedictions</HI> of Men, because they
are Men like our selves? And is it not as reaso∣nable,
to despise the sprinkling of Water, a
Creature below us, a senseless and inanimate
Creature?</P>
<P>Your Lordship therefore, must either find us
some other Reason for rejecting the Necessity of
<HI>Human Administrations,</HI> than because they are
<HI>Human;</HI> or else give up the Sacraments, and <HI>all</HI>
Positive Institutions along with them.</P>
<P>Surely, your Lordship must have a mighty O∣pinion
of <HI>Naaman</HI> the <HI>Syrian;</HI> who, when the
Prophet bid him go wash in <HI>Jordan</HI> seven times,
to the end he might be clean from his Leprosie,
Very <HI>wisely</HI> remonstrated. <HI>Are not</HI> Abana <HI>and</HI> Phar∣lPar,
<HI>Rivers of</HI> Damascus, <HI>better than all the Waters
of</HI> Israel?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28"/>
This, my Lord, discover'd <HI>Naaman</HI>'s great <HI>Li∣berty</HI>
of Mind; and 'tis much this has not been
produc'd before, as an Argument of his being a
<HI>Free-Thinker.</HI> He took the Water of <HI>Jordan</HI> to be
<HI>only Water;</HI> as your Lordship justly observes a
Clergyman to be <HI>only</HI> a Man: And if you had
been with him, you could have inform'd him,
that the washing <HI>seven times</HI> was a mere <HI>Nicety</HI>
and <HI>Trifle</HI> of the Prophet; and that since it is
God alone who can work <HI>miraculous Cures,</HI> we
ought not to think, that they depend upon any
external Means, or any stated Number of re∣peating
them.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the true Scope and Spirit
of your Argument: If the <HI>Syrian</HI> was right in
despising the Water of <HI>Jordan,</HI> because it was
only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; your Lordship may be right in
despising any particular Order of Clergy; because
they are but Men. Your Lordship is certainly as
right, or as wrong, as he was.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, let the common Sence of
Mankind here judge, whether, if the Clergy are
to be esteem'd as having no Authority, because
they are mere Men; it does not plainly follow,
that every thing else, every Institution that has
not some <HI>natural</HI> Force and Power to produce
the Effects designed by it, is not also to be
rejected as equally Trifling and Ineffectual.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
The Sum of the matter is this: It appears
from many express Facts, and indeed, from the
whole Series of God's Providence, that it is not
only consistent with his Attributes; but also agree∣able
to his ordinary Methods of dealing with
Mankind, that he should substitute Men to act
in his Name, and be <HI>Authoritatively</HI> employ'd
in conferring his Grace and Favours upon Man∣kind.
It appears, that your Lordship's Argument
against the Authoritative Administrations of the
Christian Clergy, does not only contradict those
Facts, and condemn the ordinary Method of
God's Dispensations; but likewise proves the
Sacraments, and every positive Institution of
Christianity to be ineffectual, and as mere <HI>Dreams</HI>
and <HI>Trifles,</HI> as the several <HI>Offices and Orders</HI> of the
Clergy.</P>
<P>This, I hope, will be esteem'd a sufficient Con∣futation
of your Lordship's Doctrine, by all who
have any true Regard or Zeal for the Christian
Religion; and only expect to be sav'd by the
Methods of Divine Grace propos'd in the Gos∣pel.</P>
<P>I shall now in a Word or two set forth the
Sacredness of the Ecclesiastical Character, as it is
founded in the New Testament; with a par∣ticular
regard to the Power of conferring Grace,
and the Efficacy of Human Benedictions.]</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
It appears therein, that all Sacerdotal Power
as deriv'd from the Holy Ghost. Our Saviour
himself took not the <HI>Minstry</HI> upon him, till he
had this Consecration: And during the time of
his Ministry he was under the Guidance and
Direction of the Holy Ghost. Thro' the Holy
Spirit he gave Commandment to the Apostles
whom he had chosen. When he ordain'd them
to the Work of the Ministry, it was with these
Words, <HI>Receive the Holy Ghost.</HI> Those whom the
Apostles ordain'd to the same Function, it was
by the same Authority: They laid their Hands
upon the Elders, exhorting them to take care of
she Flock of Christ, over which the Holy Ghost
had made them Overseers.</P>
<P>Hereby they plainly declar'd, that however this
Office was to descend from Man to Man through
<HI>Human Hands,</HI> that it was the Holy Ghost which
consecrated them to that Employment, and gave
them Authority to execute it.</P>
<P>From this it is also manifest, that the Priesthood
is a Grace of the Holy Ghost; that it is not a
Function founded in the Natural or Civil Rights
of Mankind; but is deriv'd from the Special
Authority of the Holy Ghost; and is as truly a
positive Institution as the Sacraments. So that
they who have no Authority to alter the Old Sa∣craments,
and substitute New ones, have no Pow∣er
to alter the Old Order of the Clergy, or in∣troduce
any other Order of them.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31"/>
For why can we not change the Sacraments?
Is it not, because they are only Sacraments, and
operate as they are instituted by the Holy Ghost?
Because they are useless ineffectual Rites without
this Authority? And does not the same Reason
hold as well for the Order of the Clergy? Does
not the same Scripture tell us, they are equally
instituted by the Holy Ghost, and oblige only
by virtue of his Authority? How absurd is it
therefore, to pretend to abolish, or depart from
the Settled Order of the Clergy, to make New
Orders, and think any God's Ministers, unless
we had his Authority, and could make New
Sacraments, or a New Religion?</P>
<P>My Lord, how comes it, that we cannot alter
the Scriptures? Is it not, because they are Di∣vinely
inspir'd, and dictated by the Holy Ghost?
And since it is express Scripture, that the <HI>Priest∣hood</HI>
is instituted and authoriz'd by the same Ho∣ly
Spirit, why is not the Holy Ghost as much to
be regarded in one Institution, as in another?
Why may we not as well make a Gospel, and
say, it was writ by the Holy Ghost, as make a
New Order of Clergy, and call them His; or e∣steem
them as having any relation to him?</P>
<P>From this it likewise appears, that there is an
absolute Necessity of a strict Succession of Au∣thoriz'd
Ordainers, from the Apostolical Times,
in order to constitute a <HI>Christian Priest.</HI> For since
a Commission from the Holy Ghost is necessary
for the Exercise of this Office; no one now can
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
receive it, but from those who have deriv'd their
Authority in a true Succession, from the Apo∣stles.
We could not, my Lord, call our present
Bibles the <HI>Word of God,</HI> unless we knew the Co∣pies
from which they are taken, were taken from
other true ones, till we come to the Originals
themselves. No more could we call any True
Ministers, or Authoriz'd by the Holy Ghost, who
have not receiv'd their Commission by an unin∣terrupted
Succession of Lawful Ordainers.</P>
<P>What an Excellent Divine would he be, who
should tell the World, it was not necessary that
the several Copies and Manuscripts, through
which the Scriptures have been transmitted thro'
different Ages and Languages, should be all true
ones, and none of them forg'd; that <HI>this was a
thing subject to so great Uncertainty, that God could
not hang our Salvation on such Niceties.</HI> Suppose,
for Proof of this, he should appeal to the Scrip∣tures;
and ask, where any Mention is made of
ascertaining the Truth of all the Copies? Would
not this be a Way of Arguing very Theological?
The Application is very easie.</P>
<P>Your Lordship has not one Word to prove the
uninterrupted Succession of the Clergy a <HI>Triste</HI>
or <HI>Dream;</HI> but that it is subject to so great Un∣certainty,
and is never mention'd in the Scrip∣tures.
And to the Uncertainty of it, it is equally
as uncertain, as whether the Scriptures be <HI>genuine.</HI>
There is just the same sufficient Historical Evi∣dence
for the Certainty of one, as the other.
As to its not being mention'd in the Scripture,
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
the Doctrine upon which it is founded, plainly
made it unnecessary to mention it. Is it need∣ful
for the Scriptures to tell us, that if we take
our Bible from any false Copy, that it is not the
Word of God? Why then need they tell us, that
if we are Ordain'd by Usurping False Pretend∣ers
to Ordination, not deriving their Authority
to that end from the Apostles, that we are no
Priests? Does not the thing it self speak as plain
in one Case, as in the other? The Scriptures are
only of use to us, as they are the Word of God:
We cannot have this Word of God, which was
written so many Years ago, unless we receive it
from Authentick Copies and Manuscripts.</P>
<P>The Clergy have their Commission from the
Holy Ghost: The Power of conferring this
Commission of the Holy Ghost, was left with
the Apostles: Therefore the present Clergy can∣not
have the same Commission, or Call, but from
an Order of Men, who have successively con∣vey'd
his Power from the Apostles to the present
time. So that, my Lord, I shall beg leave to
lay it down, as a plain, undeniable, Christian
Truth, that the Order of the Clergy is an Order
of as necessary Obligation, as the Sacraments;
and as unalterable as the Holy Scriptures; the
same Holy Ghost being as truly the Author and
Founder of the Priesthood, as the Institutor of
the Sacraments, or the Inspirer of those Divine
Oracles. And when your Lordship shall offer
any fresh Arguments to prove, that no particular
sort of Clergy is necessary; that the Benedicti∣ons
and Administrations of the present Clergy
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
of our most Excellent Church, are Trifling
Niceties; if I cannot shew, that the same Argu∣ments
will conclude against the Authority of the
Sacraments and the Scriptures, I faithfully pro∣mise
your Lordship to become a Convert to your
Doctrine.</P>
<P>What your Lordship charges upon your Ad∣versaries,
as an Absurd Doctrine, in pretending
the Necessity of one regular, successive, and
particular Order of the Clergy, is a True Chri∣stian
Doctrine; and as certain from Scripture,
as that we are to keep to the Institution of par∣ticular
Sacraments; or not to alter those parti∣cular
Scriptures, which now compose the Canon
of the Old and New Testament.</P>
<P>By Authoritative Benediction, we do not
mean any Natural or Intrinsick Authority of
our own: But a Commission from God, to be
Effectual Administrators of his Ordnances, and
to bless in his Name. Thus, a Person who is
sent from God to foretel things, of which he had
before no Knowledge or Notion, or to denounce
Judgments, which he has no Natural Power to
execute, may be truly said to be an <HI>Authoritative
Prophet;</HI> because he has the Authority of God for
what he does. Thus, when the Bishop is said to
confer Grace in Confirmation; this is properly
an <HI>Authoritative Benediction;</HI> because he is then as
truly doing what God has commission'd him to
do, as when a Prophet declares upon what Er∣rand
he is sent.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35"/>
'Tis in this Sence, my Lord, that the People
are said to be <HI>Authoritatively</HI> bless'd by the Re∣gular
Clergy; because they are <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Clergy,</HI> and
act by his Commission; bacause by their Hands
the People receive the Graces and Benefits of
God's Ordinances; which they have no more
Reason to expect from other Ministers of their
own Election, or if the Word may be us'd in an
abusive Sence, of their own <HI>Consecration,</HI> than
to receive Grace from Sacraments of their
own Appointment. The Scriptures teach us,
that the Holy Ghost has instituted an Order of
Clergy: We say, a Priesthood so authoriz'd,
can no more be chang'd by us, than we can
change the Scriptures, or make New Sacra∣ments,
because they are all founded on the
same Authority, without any Power of a
Dispensation delegated to us in one Case more
than in another. If therefore we have a mind
to continue in the Covenant of Christ, and
receive the Grace and Benefit of his Ordi∣nances,
we must receive them through such
Hands as he has authoriz'd for that Purpose,
to the end we may be qualify'd to partake the
Blessings of them. For as a <HI>True</HI> Priest can∣not
benefit us by administring a <HI>False</HI> Sacra∣ment;
so a <HI>True</HI> Sacrament is nothing, when
it is administred by a <HI>False Uncommission'd Mi∣nister.</HI>
Besides this Benediction which attends
the Ordinances of God, when they are thus
perform'd by authoriz'd Hands; there is a Be∣nediction
of Prayer, which we may justly think
very effectual, when pronounc'd or dispens'd by
the same Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36"/>
Thus when the Bishop or Priest intercedes for
the Congregation, or pronounces the Aposto∣lical
Benediction upon them, we do not con∣sider
this barely as an Act of Charity and
Humanity, of one Christian praying for ano∣ther;
but as the Work of a Person who is
commission'd by God▪ to <HI>bless in his Name,</HI> and be
effectually ministerial in the Conveyance of his
Graces; or as the Prayer of one who is left
with us in Christ's stead, to carry on his
great Design of saving us; and whose Bene∣dictions
are ever ratify'd in Heaven, but when
we render our selves, in one respect or other,
incapable of them.</P>
<P>Now, my Lord, they are these <HI>Sacerdotal
Prayers,</HI> these Authoriz'd Sacraments, these Com∣mission'd
Pastors, whom the Holy Ghost has
made Overseers of the Flock of Christ, that
your Lordship encourages the Layity to de∣spise.
You bid them <HI>contemn the vain Words of
Validity or Invalidity of God's Ordinances;</HI> to <HI>heed
no particular sort of Clergy, or the pretended Ne∣cessity
of their Administrations.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lordship sets up in this Controversie
for an Advocate for the Layity, against the
<HI>Arrogant Pretences,</HI> and <HI>False Claims</HI> of the Cler∣gy.
My Lord, we are no more contending
for our selves in this Doctrine, than when we
insist upon any Article in the Creed. Nei∣ther
is it any more our particular Cause, when
we assert our Mission, than when we assert the
Necessity of the Sacraments.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37"/>
Who is to receive the Benefit of that Com∣mission
which we assert, but They? Who is to
suffer, if we pretend a False one, but Our
selves? Sad Injury, indeed, offer'd to the Layi∣ty!
That we should affect to be thought Mi∣nisters
of God for their sakes! If we really are
so, they are to receive the Benefit; if not; we
are to bear the Punishment.</P>
<P>But your Lordship comes too late in this
glorious Undertaking, to receive the Repu∣tation
of it: The Work has been already, in
the Opinion of most People, better done to your
Lordship's hands. The Famous Author of the
<HI>Rights of the Christian Church,</HI> has carry'd this
<HI>Christian Liberty</HI> to as great Heights as your
Lordship. And tho' you have not one Noti∣on,
I can recollect, that has given Offence▪ to
the World, but what seems taken from that
pernicious Book; yet your Lordship is not so
just, as ever once to cite or mention the Au∣thor;
who, if your Lordship's Doctrine be
true, deserves to have a Statue erected to his
Honour, and receive every Mark of Esteem
which is due to the greatest Reformer of Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>Did not mine own Eyes allure me, that he
has cast no Contempt upon the Church, no Re∣proach
upon the Evangelical Institutions, or
the Sacred Function, but what has been secon∣ded
by your Lnrdship, I would never have
plac'd your Lordship in the same View with
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
so scandalous a Declaimer against the Ordinan∣nances
of Christ. Whether I am right or not,
in this Charge, I freely leave to the Judgment
of those to determine, who are acquainted with
both your Works. Yet this Author, my Lord,
has been treated by the greatest and best Part
of the Nation, as a Free-thinking Infidel. But
for what my Lord? Not that he has declar'd a∣gainst
the Scriptures; not that he has rejected
Revelation; (we are not, blessed be God, still
so far corrupted with the Principles of Infide∣lity)
but because he has reproach'd every par∣ticular
Church, as such, and deny'd all Obli∣gation
to Communion; because he has expos'd
Benedictions, Absolutions and Excommunicati∣ons;
deny'd the Divine Right of the Clergy,
and ridicul'd the pretended Sacredness and Ne∣cessity
of their Administrations, as mere Nice∣ties
and Trifles, tho' commonly in more di∣stant,
I was going to say, more decent Ways:
In a word, because he made all Churches, all
Priests, all Sacraments, however administred,
equally valid, and deny'd any particular Me∣thod
necessary to Salvation. Yet after all this
prophane Declamation, he allows, my Lord,
that <HI>Religious Offices may be appropriated to particular
Men, call'd</HI> Clergy, <HI>for Order sake only; and
not on the Account of any peculiar Spiritual Advan∣tages,
Powers or Privileges, which those who art set
apart for them, have from Heaven</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 131.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39"/>
Agreeable to this, your Lordship owns, that
you are not against the <HI>Order,</HI> or <HI>Decency,</HI> or <HI>Sub∣ordination
belonging to Christian Societies</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Answer to Dr. <HI>Snape,</HI> p. 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, pray, my Lord, do you mean any more
by this, than the above-mention'd Author? Is it
for any thing, but the sake of a little external
<HI>Order</HI> or <HI>Conveniency?</HI> Is there any Christian Law
that obliges to observe this kind of Order? Is
there any real essential Difference between Per∣sons
rank'd into this Order? Is it a Sin for any
body, especially the Civil Magistrate, to leave
this Order, and make what other Orders he
prefers to it? This your Lordship cannot resolve
in the Affirmative; for then you must allow,
that some Communions are safer than others,
and that some Clergy have more Authority than
others.</P>
<P>Will your Lordship say, that no <HI>particular</HI> Or∣der
can be necessary; yet some Order necessary,
which may be different in different Commu∣nions?
This cannot hold good upon your Lord∣ship's
Principles: For since Christ has left no
Law about any Order, no Members of any par∣ticular
Communion need submit to that Order;
since it is confess'd by your Lordship, That in
Religion no Laws, but those of Christ, are of
any Obligation. So that, tho' you don't dis∣claim
all external Order and Decency your
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
self, yet you have taught other People to do it
if they please, and as much as they please.</P>
<P>Suppose, my Lord, some Layman, upon a
Pretence of your Lordship's Absence, or any
other, should go into the Dlocess of <HI>Bangor,</HI>
and there pretend to Ordain Clergymen;
could your Lordship quote one Text of Scri∣pture
against him? Could you alledge any
Law of Christ, or his Apostles, that he had
broken? Could you prove him guilty of any
Sin? No, my Lord, you would not do that;
because this would be acknowledging such a
thing as a <HI>Sinful Ordination;</HI> and if there be Sin∣ful
Ordinations, then there mus be some <HI>Law</HI>
concerning Ordinations: For <HI>Sin is the Trans∣gression
of the Law:</HI> And if there be a Law con∣cerning
Ordinations, then we must keep to the
Clergy <HI>lawfully</HI> Ordain'd; and must confess,
after all your Lordship has said, or can say, that
still some Communions are safer than others.</P>
<P>If you should reprove such a one, as an <HI>Eng∣lishman,</HI>
for acting in Opposition to the <HI>English</HI>
Laws of <HI>Decency and Order;</HI> he would answer,
That he has nothing to do with such <HI>Trifles;</HI>
That Christ was sole Lawgiver in his King∣dom;
That he was content to have his King∣dom
as <HI>Orderly</HI> and <HI>Decent</HI> as Christ had left
it; and since he had instituted no Laws in
that matter, it was presuming for others to
take upon them to add any thing by way
of <HI>Order</HI> or <HI>Decency,</HI> by Laws of their own:
That as he had as much Authority from
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
Christ, to Ordain Clergy, as your Lordship,
he would not depart from his Christian Li∣berty.</P>
<P>If he should remonstrate to your Lordship in
these, or Words to the like effect, he would
only reduce your Lordship's own Doctrine to
Practice. This, my Lord, is pare of that Con∣fusion
the Learned Dr. <HI>Snape</HI> has charged you
with being the Author of, in the Church of
God. And all Persons, my Lord, whom you
have taught not to regard any particular sort of
Clergy, must know (if they have the common
Sense to which you appeal) that then no Cler∣gy
are at all necessary; and that it's as lawful
for any Man to be his own Priest, as to solli∣cit
his own Cause. For to say, that no particu∣lar
sort of Clergy are necessary, and yet that in
general, the Clergy are necessary, is the same
as to say, that Truth is necessary to be believ'd;
yet the Belief of no particular Truth is ne∣cessary.</P>
<P><HI>The next thing to be consider'd, my Lord, is
your Doctrine concerning Absolutions. You
begin thus:</HI> The same you will find a sufficient
Reply to their presumptuous Claim to an Authoritative
Absolution. An infallible Absolution cannot belong to
fallible Men. But no Absolution can be Authoritative,
which is not Infallible. Therefore no Authoritative Ab∣solution
can belong to any Man living.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preservative, <HI>p.</HI> 92.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"/>
I must observe here, your Lordship does not
reject this <HI>Absolution,</HI> because the Claim of it is
not founded in Scripture; but by an Argument
drawn from the nature of the Thing: Because
you imagine, such Absolution requires Infallibi∣lity
for the Execution of it; therefore it can∣not
belong to Men. Should this be true, it
would prove, that if our Saviour had really so
intended, he could not have given this Power
to his Ministers. But, my Lord, who can see any
Repugnancy in the Reason of the Thing it self?
Is it not as easie to conceive, that our Lord
should confer his Grace of Pardon by the Hands
of his Ministers, as by Means of the Sacra∣ments?
And may not such Absolution be justly
called <HI>Authoritative,</HI> the Power of which is gran∣ted,
and executed by his Authority?</P>
<P>Is it impossible for Men to have this Authori∣ty
from God, because they may mistake in the
Exercise of it? This Argument proves too
much; and makes as short work with every In∣stitution
of Christianity, as with this Power of
Absolution.</P>
<P>For if it is impossible, that Men should have
Authority from God to Absolve in his Name,
because they are not Infallible; this makes them
equally incapable of being entrusted with any
other Means of Grace; and consequently,
supposes the whole Priests Office to imply a di∣rect
Impossbility in the very Notion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43"/>
Your Lordship's Argument is this: Christians
have their Sins pardon'd upon certain Conditi∣ons;
but Fallible Men cannot certainly know
these Conditions; therefore Fallible Men cannot
have Authority to <HI>Absolve.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I take occasion to argue thus:
Persons are to be admitted to the Sacraments
on certain Conditions; But Fallible Men can∣not
tell, whether they come qualified to receive
them according to these Conditions; Therefore
Fallible Men cannot have Authority to admi∣nister
the Sacraments.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> This Argument subverts all Authority
of the Christian Religion it self, and the Rea∣son
of every instituted Means of Grace. For
if nothing can be Authoritative, but what a
Man is infallibly assured of; then the Christian
Religion cannot be an Authoritative Method of
Salvation; since a Man, by being a Christian,
does not become infallibly certain of his Salvati∣on:
Nor does Grace infallibly attend the Parti∣cipation
of the Sacraments. So that tho' your
Lordship has form'd this Argument only against
this Absolving Power; yet it has as much Force
against the Sacraments, and the Christian Re∣ligion
it self. For if it be absurd to suppose,
that the Priest should absolve any one, because
he cannot be certain that he deserves Absolution;
does it not imply the same Absurdity, to suppose,
that he should have the Power of Administring
the Sacraments, when he cannot be <HI>infallibly
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
rtain,</HI> that those who receive them, are duly
qualified? If a Possibility of Error destroys the
Power in one Case, it as certainly destroys it
in the other. Again, if Absolution cannot be
Authoritative, unless it be Infallible; then, it is
plain, that the Christian Religion is not an
Authoritative Means of Salvation; because all
Christians are not infallibly sav'd: Nor can the
Sacraments be Authoritative Means of Grace;
because <HI>all</HI> who partake of them, do not infalli∣bly
obtain Grace.</P>
<P><HI>Your Lordship proceeds with your Layity by
way of Expostulation:</HI> If they amuse you with
that Power which Christ left with his Apostles,
Whose soever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them; and whose soever Sins ye retain, they are re∣tained
unto them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 93</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But why <HI>amuse,</HI> my Lord? Are the Texts of
Holy Scripture to be treated as only Matter of
<HI>Amusement?</HI> Or does your Lordship know of a∣ny
Age in the Church, when the very same Do∣ctrine
which we now teach, has not been taught
from the same Texts?</P>
<P>Do you know any Successors of the Apostles,
that thought the Power there specify'd, did not
belong them? But however, your Lordship has
taught your Layity to believe what we argue
from this Text, all Amusement; and told them,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
<HI>They may securely answer, that it is impossible for
them to depend upon this Right as any thing certain,
till they can prove to you, that every thing spoken to
the Apostles, belongs to Ministers in all Ages</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 94.</NOTE>.
The Security of this Answer, my Lord, is
founded upon this False Presumption, <HI>viz.</HI> That
the Clergy can claim no Right to the Exer∣cise
of any Part of their Office, <HI>as Successors of
the Apostles,</HI> till they can prove, that every
thing that was spoken to the Apostles, be∣longs
to them.</P>
<P>This Proposition must be true; or else there
is no Force or <HI>Security</HI> in the Objection you here
bring for the Instruction of the Layity. If it
is well founded, then the Clergy can't possi∣bly
prove, they have any more Right to the
Exercise of any Part of their Office than the
Layity. Do they pretend to Ordain, Confirm,
to admit or exclude Men from the Sacraments?
By what Authority is all this done? Is it not,
because the Apostles, whose Successors they
are, did the same things? But then, say your
Lordship's well-instructed Layity, this is no∣thing
to the purpose: Prove your selves A∣postles;
prove, that every thing said to the
Apostles, belongs to you; and then it will be
allow'd, that you may exercise these Powers,
because they exercised them: But as this is im∣possible
to be done; so it is impossible for you
to prove, that you have any Powers or Autho∣rities,
because they had them.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46"/>
And now, my Lord, if the Case be thus,
what Apology shall we make for Christi∣anity,
as it has been practis'd in all Ages? How
shall we excuse the noble Army of Martyrs,
Saints and Confessors, who have boldly assert∣ed
the Right to so many Apostolical Powers?
Could any Men in those Ages pretend, <HI>that e∣very
thing that was spoken to the Apostles, belonged
to themselves?</HI> False then, was their Claim, and
presumptuous their Authority, who should pre∣tend
to any Apostolical Powers, because the A∣postles
had them; when they could not prove,
<HI>that every thing that was spoken to the Apostles, be∣longed
to them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Farther; to prove, that the above-mention'd
Text does not confer the Power of Absolution
in the Clergy, you reason thus:</HI> Whatever con∣tradicts
the natural Notions of God, and the Design
and Tenour of the Gospel, cannot be the true Meaning
of any Passage in the Gospel: But to make the Ab∣solution
of weak and fallible Men, so necessary, or so
valid, that God will not pardon without them; or
that all are pardon'd, who have them pronounced over
them, is, to contradict those Notions, as well as the
plain Tenour of the Gospel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="47"/>
Be pleas'd, my Lord, to point out your Ad∣versary:
Name any one Church of <HI>England</HI> Man
that ever taught this Romantick Doctrine which
you are confuting. Whoever taught such a Ne∣cessity
of Absolutions, that God will pardon
none without them? Whoever declar'd, that all
are pardon'd, who have them pronounc'd over
them? We teach the <HI>Necessity</HI> and <HI>Validity</HI> of
Sacraments; but do we ever declare, that all are
sav'd who receive them? Is there no <HI>Medium</HI>
between Two Extreams? No such thing, my
Lord, as <HI>Moderation!</HI> Must every thing be thus
Absolute and Extravagant, or nothing at all?</P>
<P><HI>In another Page, we have more of this same
Colouring:</HI> But to claim a Right to stand in God's
stead, in such a Sence, that they can absolutely and
certainly bless, or not bless, with their Voice alone:
This is the highest Absurdity and Blasphemy, as it
supposeth God to place a Set of Men above himself;
and to put out of his own Hands the Disposal of
his Blessings and Curses<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If your Lordship had employ'd all this O∣ratory
against worshipping the Sun or Moon,
it had just affected your Adversaries as much
as this. For whoever taught, that any Set of
Men could <HI>Absolutely bless,</HI> or withold Bles∣sing,
independent of God? Whoever taught,
that the Christian Religion, or Sacraments, or
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
Absolution sav'd People on course, or without
proper Dispositions? Who ever claim'd such an
Absolving Power, as to set himself above God,
and to take from him the Disposal of his own
Blessings and Curses? What has such extrava∣gant
Descriptions, such Romantick Characters
of Absolution, to do with that Power the Clergy
justly claim? Cannot there be a Necessity in
some Cases of receiving Absolution from their
Hands, except they set themselves above God?
Is God robb'd of the Disposal of his Blessings,
when in Obedience to his own Commands, and
in virtue of his own Authority, they admit some
as Members of the Church, and exclude others
from the Communion of it? Do they pretend to
be Channels of Grace, or the Means of Par∣don,
by any Rights or Powers naturally inhe∣rent
in them? Do they not in all these things
consider themselves as lnstruments of God, that
are made ministerial to the Edification of the
Church, purely by his Will, and only so far
as they act in Conformity to it? Now if it has
pleas'd God to confer the Holy Ghost in Ordi∣nation,
Confirmation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> only by them, and
to annex the Grace of Pardon to the Impositi∣on
of their Hands, on returning Sinners; is it
any <HI>Blasphemy</HI> for them to claim and exert their
Power? Is the Prerogative of God injur'd, be∣cause
his own Institutions are obey'd? Cannot
he dispense his Graces by what Persons, and on
what Terms he pleases? Is he depriv'd of the Dis∣posal
of his Blessings, because they are be∣stow'd
on Persons according to his Order, and
in obedience to his Authority? If I should
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
affirm, that Bishops have the sole Power to
Ordain and Confirm, would this be robbing
God of his Disposal of those Graces that at∣tend
such Actions? Is it not rather allowing and
submitting to God's own Disposal, when we
keep close to those Methods of it, which him∣self
has prescrib'd?</P>
<P>Pray, my Lord, consider the Nature of Sa∣craments.
Are not they necessary to Salvation?
But is God therefore excluded from any Power
of his own? Has he for that reason, set Bread
and Wine in the Eucharist, or Water in Baptism,
above Himself? Has he put the Salvation of
Men out of his own Power, because it depends
on his own Institutions? Is the Salvation of
Christians less his own Act and Deed, or less
the Effect of his own Mercy, because these Sa∣craments
in great measure contribute to effect
it? Why then, my Lord, must that Imposition
of Hands, that is attended with his Grace of
Pardon, and which has no Pretence to such
Grace, but in obedience to his Order, and in
virtue of his Promise, be thus destructive of his
Prerogative? Where is there any Diminution of
his Honour or Authority, if such Actions of the
Clergy are made necessary to the Salvation of
Souls in some Circumstances, as their washing
in Water, or their receiving Bread and Wine?
Cannot God institute Means of Grace, but those
Means must needs be above Himself? They owe
all their Power and Efficacy to his Institution;
and can operate no farther than the Ends for
which he instituted them. How then is he De∣thron'd
for being thus obey'd?</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50"/>
My Lord, you take no notice of Scripture;
but in a new Way of your own contend against
this Power, from the Nature of the Thing:
Yet I must beg Leave to say, this Power stands
upon as sure a Bottom, and is as consistent with
the Goodness and Majesty of God, as the Sa∣craments.
If the annexing Grace to Sacra∣ments,
and making them necessary Means of Sal∣vation,
be a reasonable Institution of God; so is
his annexing Pardon to the Imposition of Hands
by the Clergy on returning Sinners. The
Grace or Blessing receiv'd in either Case, is of
his own giving, and in a Method of his own
prescribing. And how this should be any Inju∣ry
to God's Honour, or Affront to his Majesty,
cannot easily be accounted for.</P>
<P>The Clergy justly claim a Power of Recon∣ciling
Men to God, from express Texts of Scri∣pture;
and of delivering his Pardons to penitent
Sinners. Your Lordship disowns this Claim, as
making Fallible Men the Absolute Dispensers of
God's Blessings, and putting it in their Power
to damn and save as they please. But, my Lord,
nothing of this Extravagance is included in it.
They are only entrusted with a <HI>Conditional</HI> Pow∣er;
which they are to exercise according to the
Rules God has given; and it only obtains its
Effect when it is so exercis'd. Every instituted
Means of Grace is <HI>Conditional;</HI> and is only then
effectual, when it is attended with such Cir∣cumstances,
as are requir'd by God. If the Cler∣gy,
thro' Weakness, Passion or Prejudice, ex∣clude
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
Persons from the Church of God, they
injure only themselves. But, my Lord, are
these Powers nothing, because they may be ex∣ercis'd
in vain? Have the Clergy no Right at
all to them, because they are not <HI>Absolutely
infallible</HI> in the Exercise of them?</P>
<P>Can you prove, my Lord, that they are not
necessary, because they have not always the
same Effect? May not that be necessary to Sal∣vation,
which is only effectual on <HI>certain Con∣ditions?</HI>
Is not the Christian Religion neces∣sary
to Salvation, tho' all Christians are not sav'd?
Are not the Sacraments necessary Means of
Grace, tho' the Means of Grace obtain'd there∣by
is only Conditional? Is every one necessa∣rily
improv'd in Grace, who receives the Sacra∣ment?
Or is it less necessary, because the sa∣lutary
Effects of it are not more universal?
Why then must the Imposition of Hands be less
necessary, because the Grace of it is Conditi∣onal,
and only obtain'd in due and proper Cir∣cumstances?
Is Absolution nothing, because if
witheld wrongfully, it injures not the Person
who is deny'd it; and if given without due
Dispositions in the Penitent, it avails nothing?
Is not this equally true of the Sacraments, if
they are deny'd wrongfully, or administred to
unprepar'd Receivers? But do they therefore
cease to be standing and necessary Means of
Grace?</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52"/>
The Argument therefore against this Power,
drawn from the Ignorance or Passions of the
Clergy, whereby they may mistake or pervert
the Application of it, can be of no Force;
since it is as Conditional as any other Christian
Institution. The Salvation of no Man can be
endanger'd by the Ignorance or Passions of any
Clergyman in the Use of this Power: If they
err in the Exercise of it, the Consequences of
their Error only affect themselves. The Admi∣nistration
of the Sacraments is certainly entrust∣ed
to them: But will any one say, that the Sa∣craments
are not necessary to Salvation; because
they may, through Ignorance or Passion, make
an ill Use of this Trust?</P>
<P>There is nothing in this Doctrine to gratifie
the Pride of Clergymen, or encourage them to
Lord it over the Flock of Christ. If you could
suppose an Atheist or a Deift in Orders; he
might be arrogant, and domineer in the Exer∣cise
of his Powers: But who, that has the least
Sense of Religion, can think it matter of Tri∣umph,
that he can deny the Sacraments, or re∣fuse
his Benediction to any of his Flock?
Can he injure or offend the least of these; and
will not God take Account? Or, if they fall
through his Offence, will not their Blood be re∣quir'd
at his Hands?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53"/>
Neither is there any thing in it that can en∣slave
the Layity to the Clergy; or make their
Salvation depend upon their Arbitrary Will.
Does any one think his Salvation in danger, be∣cause
the Sacraments (the necessary Means of
it) are only to be administred by the Clergy?
Why then must the Salvation of <HI>Penitents</HI> be en∣danger'd,
or made dependent on the sole Plea∣sure
of the Clergy, because they alone can
reconcile them to the Favour of God? If Per∣sons
are unjustly denied the Sacraments, they
may humbly hope, that God will not lay the
Want of them to their Charge. And if they
are unjustly kept out of the Church, and denied
Admittance, they have no Reason to fear, but
God will, notwithstanding, accept them, pro∣vided
they be in other respects proper Objects of
his Favour.</P>
<P><HI>But to proceed, your Lordship says,</HI> The A∣postles
might possibly understand the Power of Remitting
and Retaining Sins, to be that Power of Laying their
Hands upon the Sick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pagex</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Is this Possible, my Lord? Then it is <HI>possible,</HI>
the Apostles might think, that in the Power here
intended to be given them, <HI>nothing at all</HI> was in∣tended
to be given them. For the Power of
Healing the Sick, was already confer'd upon
them. Therefore if no more was intended to
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
be given them in this Text, it cannot be inter∣preted,
as having entitled them properly to any
Power at all.</P>
<P>2. The Power mention'd here, was something
that Jesus promis'd he would give them Hereaf∣ter:
Which plainly supposes, they had it not
then: But they then had the Power of <HI>Healing;</HI>
therefore something else must be intended
here.</P>
<P>3. The Power of the <HI>Keys</HI> has always been
look'd upon as the highest in the Apostolical
Order. But if it related only to the Power of
Healing, it could not be so; For the <HI>Seventy,</HI>
who were inferiour to the Apostles, had this
Power.</P>
<P>4. The very Manner of Expression in this
Place, proves, that the Power here intended to
be given, could not relate to <HI>Healing the Sick,</HI>
or to any thing of that nature; but to some
<HI>Spiritual Power,</HI> whose Effects should not be
<HI>Visible;</HI> but be made good by virtue of God's Pro∣mise.
Thus, <HI>Whomsoever ye shall</HI> heal <HI>on Earth,</HI>
I will heal <HI>in Heaven,</HI> borders too near upon an
Absurdity. There is no occasion to promise to
make <HI>good</HI> such Actions as are good already, and
have antecedently produc'd their Effects. Per∣sons
who were restor'd to Health, to their Sight,
or the Use of their Limbs, did not want to be
assured, that the Apostles, by whom they were
restored, had a Power to that End; the Exer∣cise
of which Power, prov'd and confirm'd it self.
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
There was no need therefore of a Divine As∣surance,
that a Person who was healed, was actu∣ally
healed in virtue of it. But when we con∣sider
this Promise, as relating to a <HI>Power</HI> whose
<HI>Effects</HI> are not <HI>visible;</HI> as the <HI>Pardon of Sins,</HI> the
Terms whereby it is exprest, are most proper:
And it is very reasonable to suppose God promi∣sing,
that the Spiritual Powers exercis'd by his
Ministers on Earth, though they do not here
produce their <HI>visible Effects,</HI> shall yet be made
good and effectual by him in Heaven.</P>
<P>These Reasons, my Lord, I should think, are
sufficient to convince any one, that the Apostles
could not <HI>possibly</HI> understand these Words in the
<HI>Sence of your Lordship.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let us now consider the Commission gi∣ven
to</HI> Peter. <HI>Our Saviour said to him,</HI> Thou
art <HI>Peter,</HI> and upon this Rock I will build my
Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against
it: And I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom
of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth,
shall be bound in Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.</P>
<P>Now, my Lord, how should it enter into the
Thoughts of <HI>Peter,</HI> that nothing was here in∣tended,
or promised by our Saviour, but a Pow∣er
of Healing; which he not only had before,
but also many other Disciples, who were not
Apostles? <HI>I will give unto thee the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven;</HI> that is, according to your
Lordship, <HI>I will give thee Power to heal the Sick.</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
Can any thing be more contrary to the plain
obvious Sence of the Words? Can any one be
said to have the <HI>Keys</HI> of the Kingdom of Hea∣ven,
because he may be the Instrument of resto∣ring
People to Health? Are Persons Mem∣bers
of Christ's Kingdom, with any regard to
Health? How then can He have any Powers
in that Kingdom; or be said to have the <HI>Keys</HI>
of it, who is only empower'd to cure Distem∣pers?
Could any one be said to have the <HI>Keys</HI> of
a Temporal Kingdom, who had no Temporal
Power given him in that Kingdom? Must not
he therefore who has the <HI>Keys</HI> of a Spiritual
Kingdom, have some Spiritual Power in that
Kingdom?</P>
<P>Christ has told us, that his Kingdom is not
of this World. Your Lordship has told us, that
it is so foreign to every thing of this World,
that no <HI>Worldly Terrors</HI> or Allurements, no Pains
or Pleasures of the Body, can have any thing to
do with it. Yet here your Lordship teaches us,
that He may have the <HI>Keys</HI> of this Spiritual
Kingdom, who has only a Power over Diseases.
My Lord, are not Sickness and Health, Sight
and Limbs, Things of this World? Have they
not some relation to Bodily Pleasures and Pains?
How then can a Power about Things wholly
confin'd to this World, be a Power in a Kingdom
that is not of this World? The Force of the
Argument lies here: Our Saviour has assur'd us,
that his Kingdom is not of this World: Your
Lordship takes it to be of so Spiritual a Nature,
that it ought not, nay, that it cannot be encou∣rag'd
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
or establish'd by any Worldly Powers. <HI>Our
Saviour gives to his Apostles the Keys of this King∣dom.</HI>
Yet you have so far forgotten your own
Doctrine, and the Spirituality of this Kingdom,
that you tell us, He here gave them a Temporal
Power of Diseases; though He says, they were
the <HI>Keys of his Kingdom</HI> which he gave them.
Suppose any Successor of the Apostles should
from this Text pretend to the Power of the
Sword, to make People Members of this
Kingdom: Must not the Answer be, that he
mistakes the Power, by not considering, that
they are only the <HI>Keys</HI> of a <HI>Spiritual,</HI> not of a
Temporal Kingdom, which were here deliver'd
to the Apostles.</P>
<P>I humbly presume, my Lord, that this would
be as good an Answer to your Lordship's Doctrine,
as to Theirs, who claim the Right of the Sword.
till it can be shewn that <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Sickness, Sight</HI>
and <HI>Limbs,</HI> do not as truly relate to the Things
of this World as the Power of the Sword.</P>
<P>If this Power of the Keys must be understood,
only as a Power of inflicting or curing Diseases;
then the Words, in the proper Construction of
them, must run thus: <HI>Thou art</HI> Peter, <HI>and upon this
Rock I will build my Church,</HI> i. e. a peculiar Socie∣ty
of Healthful People, <HI>and the Gates of Hell shall
never prevail against it;</HI> i. e. They shall always
be in a State of Health. <HI>I will give unto Thee, the
Keys of this Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> i. e. Thou shalt
have the Power of inflicting and curing Distem∣pers;
<HI>and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth, shall be
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
bound in Heaven,</HI> i.e. on whomsoever thou shalt inflict
the Leprosie on Earth. He shall be a Leper in
Heaven; <HI>and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth,
shall be loos'd in Heaven,</HI> i. e. whomsoever thou shalt
cure of that Disease on Earth, shall be perfectly
cur'd of it in Heaven.</P>
<P>This, without putting any Force upon the Words,
is your Lordship's own Interpretation; which ex∣poses
the Honour and Authority of Scriptures as
much as the greatest Enemy to them can wish. If
our Saviour cou'd mean by these Words, only a
<HI>Power</HI> of <HI>healing Distempers;</HI> or if the Apostles un∣derstood
them in that Sence, we may as well be∣lieve,
that when He said, <HI>His Kingdom was not of
this World,</HI> that he meant, it was of this World;
and that the Apostles so understood him too.</P>
<P><HI>But however, for the Benefit and Edification
of the Layity, your Lordship has another Interpre∣tation
for them: You say,</HI> if they <HI>(the Apostles)</HI>
did apply this Power of remitting Sins to the certain Ab∣solution
of particular Persons, it is plain, they could do
it upon no other Bottom but this; that God's Will, and
good Pleasure, about such particular Persons was infal∣libly
communicated to them.</P>
<P>Pray my Lord, how, or where is this so plain?
Is it plain, that they never baptiz'd Persons, till
God had <HI>infallibly communicated his good Pleasure to
them about such particular Persons?</HI> Baptism is an In∣stitution
equally Sacred with this other, and puts
the Person baptiz'd in the same State of Grace,
<HI>that Absolution</HI> does the Penitent. Baptism is de∣sign'd
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
for the Remission of Sin. It is an Ordi∣nance
to which Absolution is consequent, but I
suppose, Persons may be baptiz'd without such
<HI>Infallible Communication</HI> promised, as your Lordship
contends for. If therefore it be not necessary for
the Exercise of Absolution by Baptism, why must
it be necessary for Absolution by the Imposition
of Hands?</P>
<P>Can Pastors without Infallibility, baptize Hea∣thens,
and absolve, or be the Instruments of absol∣ving
them thereby from their Sins? Are they
not as able to absove Christian Penitents, or re∣store
those who have Apostatiz'd? If Human
Knowledge, and the common Rules of the Church,
be sufficient to direct the Priest to whom he
ought to administer the Sacraments; they are
also sufficient for the Exercise of this other Part
of the Sacerdotal Office.</P>
<P>But your Lordship proceeds thus: <HI>Not that they</HI>
themselves <HI>Absolved any.</HI></P>
<P>No, my Lord, no more than Water in Bap∣tism
of <HI>it self</HI> purifies the Soul from Sin. This
Baptismal Water, is, notwithstanding necessary
or the Remission of our Sins.</P>
<P>Again you say, <HI>Not that God was oblig'd to bind
and loose the Guilt of Aden, according to their De∣clarations,
considered as their own Decisions, and
their own Determinations</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page</NOTE>. No, my Lord; who∣ever.
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
ever thought so? God is not oblig'd to confer
(race by the <HI>Baptismal Water,</HI> consider'd only as
<HI>Water;</HI> but He is, consider'd as <HI>his own Institution</HI>
for that End and Purpose. So, if these Decla∣rations
are consider'd only as <HI>the Declarations of
Men,</HI> God is not obliged by them: But when
they are consider'd as the Declarations of <HI>Men</HI>
whom he has especially Authoriz'd to make
<HI>such</HI> Declarations in his Name, then they are
as effectual with God, as any other of his Insti∣tution's
whatever.</P>
<P>I proceed now to a Paragraph that bears as
hard upon our Saviour, as some others have done
upon his Apostles and their Successors; where
your Lordship designs to prove, that though
Christ claim'd a Power of remitting Sins Him∣self,
or in his own Person, yet that he had re∣ally
no such Power.</P>
<P><HI>You go upon these Words:</HI> If we look back upon
our Saviour himself, we shall find, that when he de∣clares
that the Son of Man had Power upon Earth to
forgive Sins, even He himself either meant by it, the
Power of a miraculous Releasing Man from his Affli∣ction;
or if it related to another more Spiritual Sence
of the Words, the Power of declaring, that the Man's
Sins were forgiven by God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preservative, <HI>p.</HI> 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61"/>
The Words of our Saviour, which we are to
look back upon, are these: <HI>Whether is it easier to
say, thy Sins are forgiven thee; or to say, arise, take
up thy Bed and walk? But that ye may know, the
Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins,</HI>
(Mark 2. 9, 10.) As if he had said, <Q>Is not the
same Divine Authority and Power requir'd?
Is it not a Work as peculiar to God, to per∣form
miraculous Cures, as to forgive Sins?
The Reason therefore, why I now chuse to
declare my Authority, rather by saying, <HI>Thy
Sins are forgiven thee,</HI> than by saying, <HI>Arise and
walk,</HI> was, purely to teach you this Truth,
that the Power of the Son of Man is not con∣fin'd
to Bodily Cures; but that he has Power
on Earth to forgive Sins.</Q></P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the first obvious Sence of
the Words; and therefore I take it to be the
True Sence. But your Lordship can look back
upon them, till you find, that Christ has not
this Power, though he claims it expressly; but
that he only intends a Power of doing <HI>some∣thing
or other,</HI> which no more imports a Power
of forgiving Sins, than of remitting any Tem∣poral
Debt or Penalty.</P>
<P>If our Blessed Saviour had intended to teach
the World, that he was invested with this Power,
I would gladly know, how he must have ex∣press'd
himself, to have satisfy'd your Lordship
that he really had it? He must have told you,
that he had not this Power; and then possibly,
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
your Lordship would have taught us, that he had
this Power. For no one can discover any Rea∣son
why you should deny it him; but because
he has in express Words claim'd and asserted it.
I hope, your Lordship has not so low an Opini∣on
of our Saviour's Person, as to think it unrea∣sonable
in the Nature of the Thing, that He
should have this Power. Where does it contra∣dict
any Principle of Reason, to say, that a <HI>King</HI>
should be able to pardon his Subjects? Since
there is no Absurdity then in the Thing it self;
and it is so expressly asserted in Scripture; it is
just Matter of Surprize, that your Lordship should
carry your Reader from a plain consistent Sence
of the Words, to <HI>either this or that Something or o∣ther,</HI>
the Origin whereof is only to be sought
for in your Lordship's own Invention; rather
than not exclude Christ from a Power which he
declar'd he had, and declar'd he had it for this
very Reason, <HI>that we might know that he had it.</HI>
Our Saviour has told us, that the Way to Hea∣ven
is <HI>narrow.</HI> Your Lordship might as reasona∣bly
prove from hence, that he meant, it was
<HI>broad,</HI> as that he did not mean he could forgive
Sins, when he said, <HI>that ye may know, that the
Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lordship has rejected all <HI>Church Authori∣ty,</HI>
and despis'd the pretended <HI>Powers</HI> of the
Clergy, for this reason; because Christ is the
<HI>sole King, sole Lawgiver, and Judge in his King∣dom.</HI>
But, it seems, your Lordship, notwith∣standing,
thinks it now time to depose him:
And this <HI>sole King</HI> in <HI>his own Kingdom,</HI> must
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
not be allow'd to be capable of pardoning his
own Subjects.</P>
<P>This Doctrine, my Lord; is deliver'd, I sup∣pose,
as your other Doctrines, out of a hearty
Concern and <HI>Christian</HI> Zeal for the Privileges
of the Layity; and to shew, that your Lord∣ship
is not only able to limit as you please,
the Authority of <HI>Temporal Kings;</HI> but also to
make Christ himself <HI>sole King,</HI> and yet <HI>no King,</HI>
in his Spiritual Kingdom. For, my Lord, the
Kingdom of Christ is a Society, founded in
order to the Reconciliation of Sinners to God.
If therefore Christ could not pardon Sins, to
what End could he either erect, or how could
he support his Kingdom, which is only in the
great and last Design of it, to consist of Ab∣solv'd
Sinners? He that cannot forgive Sins
in a Kingdom that is erected for the Re∣mission
of Sins, can no more be <HI>sole King</HI> in
it, than he that has no <HI>Temporal Power,</HI> can
be <HI>sole King</HI> in a <HI>Temporal Kingdom.</HI> Therefore
your Lordship has been thus mighty serviceable
to the Christian Layity, as to teach them, that
Christ is not only <HI>sole King,</HI> but <HI>no King</HI> in his
Kingdom.</P>
<P>This is not the First Contradiction your
Lordship has unhappily fallen into, in your At∣tempts
upon <HI>Kingly Authority.</HI> Not is it the Iast;
which I shall presume to observe to the <HI>Common
Sense</HI> of your Layity.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64"/>
Again, in this Account of our Blessed Sa∣viour,
your Lordship has made no difference
between Him and his Apostles, as to this
<HI>Absolving Authority.</HI> For you say, the <HI>Great
Commission</HI> given to them, imply'd either a
Power of Releasing Men from their Bodily
Afflictions; or of declaring such to be par∣don'd,
whom God had assur'd them that he
had pardon'd: And this is <HI>all</HI> that you here
allow to Christ himself.</P>
<P>Your Lordship's calling him so often <HI>King,</HI>
and <HI>sole King, &amp;c.</HI> in his Kingdom, and yet
making him a <HI>Mere Creature</HI> in it, is too
like the Insult, and design'd Sarcasm of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> who, when they had nail'd him to the
Cross, writ over his Head, <HI>This is the King of
the Jews.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed: Your Lordship proves,
That our Saviour had not the Power of
<HI>forgiving Sins;</HI> because <HI>His Way of Expression
was. Thy Sins are forgiven thee. This was plainly
to acknowledge, and keep up that True Notion,
that God alone forgiveth Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Let us therefore put this Argument in Form.
Christ has affirm'd, that he had Power to for∣give
Sins: But his Way was, to say, <HI>Thy Sins
are forgiven thee:</HI> Therefore Christ had not
Power to forgive Sins. Q. E. D.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65"/>
It is much, your Lordship did not recommend this
to your Layity as another <HI>Invincible Demonstration.</HI>
For by the help of it, my Lord, they may prove,
that our Saviour could no more <HI>heal Diseases,</HI> than
<HI>forgive Sins.</HI> As thus; Christ indeed pretends to
a Power of Healing Diseases; but his usual way
of speaking to the diseas'd Person, was, <HI>Thy Faith
hath made Thee whole;</HI> therefore He had not the
Power of <HI>Healing</HI> Diseases. The Argument has
the same force against one Power, as against the
other. If He did not <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> because he said,
<HI>thy Sins are forgiven Thee;</HI> no more did He heal
Diseases, because he said, <HI>thy Faith hath, made Thee
whole.</HI></P>
<P>I have a Claim of several Debts upon a Man:
I forgive him them all, in these Words, <HI>Thy Debts
are remitted Thee.</HI> A Philosophical Wit stands by,
and pretends to prove, that I had not the
Power, of remitting these Debts; because I
said, <HI>Thy Debts are remitted Thee.</HI> What can come up
to, or equal such <HI>profound Philosophy,</HI> but the
<HI>Divinity,</HI> of one who teaches, our Saviour could
not forgive Sins, because He said, <HI>Thy Sins are
forgiven Thee?</HI></P>
<P>But your Lordship says, the Reason why
our Saviour thus expressed Himself, <HI>Thy Sins
are forgiven Thee, was plainly to keep up that true
Notion, that God alone forgiveth Sins.</HI> There∣fore,
my Lord, according to this Doctrine,
our Saviour was oblig'd not to claim any
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
Power that was <HI>peculiar</HI> or <HI>appropriated</HI> to God,
<HI>alone.</HI> For if this be an Argument, why He
should not <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> it is also an Argument,
that He ought not to claim any other Pow∣er,
any more than this; which is proper to
God, and only belongs to Him. But, my
Lord, if He did express himself thus, that
he might not lay Claim to any thing that
was peculiar to God, how came He in so ma∣ny
other Respects, to lay Claim to such
things, as are as truly peculiar to God, as
the Forgiveness of Sins? How came He in so
many Instances to make Himself equal to God?
How came He to say, <HI>Ye believe in God, be∣lieve
also in me? And that Men should Worship
the Son, even as the Father?</HI> That He was the
Son of God; That he was the Way, the
Truth, and the Life?</P>
<P>Are not Evangelical Faith, Worship and
Trust, Duties that are solely due to God?
Does He not as much invade the Sovereign∣ty
of God, who lays claim to these Duties,
as He that pretends to <HI>forgive Sins?</HI> Did not
Christ also give his Disciples <HI>Power and Au∣thority</HI>
over Devils and Unclean Spirits, and
Power to heal all manner of Diseases?
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
Now, if Christ did not assume a Power to <HI>forgive
Sins,</HI> because God alone could forgive Sins, it is
also as unaccountable, that He should exercise
other <HI>Authorities</HI> and Powers which are as strictly
peculiar to God, as that of forgiving Sins. As if
a Person should disown that Christ is Omniscient,
because Omniscience is an <HI>Attribute</HI> of God <HI>Alone;</HI>
and yet confess his Omnipotence, which is an
Attribute equally <HI>Divine.</HI></P>
<P>But farther, my Lord: Did our Saviour thus
designedly express himself, least He should be
thought to assume any Power which was Di∣vine,
then it is certain (according to this Opi∣nion)
that if He had assumed any such Power,
or pretended to do what was peculiar to God,
he had been the Occasion of misleading Men in∣to
Error. For if this be a plain Reason, why He
expressed himself so as to disown this Power, it
is plain, that if He had own'd it. He had been
condemn'd by this Argument, as teaching false
Doctrine.</P>
<P>Now if this would have been interpretatively
false Doctrine in Christ, to take upon Himself
any thing that was peculiar to God, the Apostles
were guilty of propagating this false Doctrine.
For there is scarce any known Attribute or
Power of God, but they ascribe it to our Savi∣our.
They declare him Eternal, Omnipotent,
Omniscient, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Is it not a <HI>true Notion,</HI> that
God alone can Create, and is Governour of the
Universe? Yet the Apostles expresly assure us
of Christ, that <HI>all things were created by Him,</HI> and
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
that <HI>God hath put all things in Subjection under his
Feet.</HI> 'Tis very surprising, that your Lordship
should exclude Christ from this Power of <HI>for∣giving</HI>
Sins, tho' he has expresly said He could
forgive Sins, because such a Power belongs only
to God; when it appears thro' the whole Scri∣pture,
that there is scarce any Divine Power
which our Saviour himself has not claim'd, nor
any Attribute of God, but what his Apostles have
ascrib'd to him. They have made Him the <HI>Cre∣ator,</HI>
the <HI>Preserver,</HI> the <HI>Governour</HI> of the Universe,
the Author of Eternal Salvation to all that obey
him; and yet your Lordship tells us, that He did
not pretend to <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> because that was a
Power peculiar to God.</P>
<P>Here is then (to speak in your Lordship's ele∣gant
Style) an <HI>immoveable Resting-Place</HI> for your
Laity to set their Feet upon; here is an <HI>Argu∣ment
that will last them for ever;</HI> They must believe
that our Saviour did not forgive Sins, <HI>because</HI> this
was a Power that belong'd to God, tho' the Scri∣ptures
assure us that every other Divine Power
belong'd to Christ. That is, they must believe,
that tho' our Saviour claim'd all Divine Powers,
yet not this Divine Power, <HI>because</HI> it is a Divine
Power. And, my Lord, if they have the com∣mon
Sense to believe this, they may also believe
that tho' our Saviour took human Nature upon
him, yet that he had not a human Soul, because it
is proper to Man. They may believe, that any
Person who has all Kingly Power, cannot remit
or reprieve a Malefactor, <HI>because</HI> it is an Act of
Kingly Power to do it; or that a Bishop cannot
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
suspend any Offender of his Diocese, because it
is an Act of Episcopal Power to do it. All these
Reasons are as strong and <HI>Demonstrative</HI> as that
Christ, who claim'd all Divine Powers, could
not forgive Sins, <HI>because</HI> it was a <HI>Divine Power.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, In this Argument your Lordship has
plainly declar'd against the Divinity of Christ,
and rank'd him in the Order of Creatures. Your
Lordship says, Christ did not forgive Sins, be∣cause
it is God <HI>alone who can forgive Sins;</HI> as plain
an Argument as can be offer'd, that in your
Lordship's Opinion, Christ is not God: For if
you believ'd him, in a true and proper Sense,
God, how could you exclude him from the
Power of forgiving Sins, <HI>because</HI> God alone can
forgive Sins? It is inconsistent with Sense and
Reason to deny this Power to Christ because it
is a Divine Power, bat only because you believe
him not to be a Divine Person. If Christ was
God, then he might forgive Sins, tho' God alone
can forgive Sins: But you say, Christ cannot
forgive Sins, because God <HI>alone</HI> can forgive Sins;
therefore it is plain, that according to your
Lordship's Doctrine, Christ is not truly, or in a
proper Sense, God.</P>
<P>Here, my Lord, I desire again to appeal to
the <HI>Common Sense</HI> of your Laity; let them judge
betwixt the Scriptures and your Lordship. The
Scriptures plainly and frequently ascribe all Di∣vine
Attributes to Christ: They make him the
Creatour and Governour of the World; God
over all, blessed for ever. Yet your Lordship
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
makes him a Creature, and denies him <HI>such</HI> a
Power, because it belongs only to God.</P>
<P>You your self, my Lord, have allow'd him to be
absolute Ruler over the Consciences of Men; to
be an arbitrary Dispenser of the Means of Salva∣tion
to Mankind; than which Powers, none can
be more Divine: And yet you hold, that he can∣not
forgive Sins, because Pardon of Sin can only
be the Effect of a Divine Power.</P>
<P>Is it not equally a Divine Power, (even ac∣cording
to your Lordship) to rule over the Con∣sciences
of Men, to give Laws of Salvation, and
to act in these Affairs with an uncontroulable
Power, as <HI>to forgive Sins?</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, let their Common Sense here dis∣cover
the Absurdity (for I must call it so) of your
<HI>New Scheme</HI> of Government in Christ's Kingdom.
Christ is <HI>absolute</HI> Lord of it, (according to your
self) and can make or unmake Laws relating to
it; can dispense or withold Grace as he pleases
in this Spiritual Kingdom, all which Powers are
purely Divine, yet you say he cannot forgive
Sins, tho' every express Power which you have
allow'd him over the Consciences of Men, be as
truly a <HI>Divine Power</HI> as that of <HI>forgiving Sins.</HI> Has
not Christ a proper and personal Power to give
Grace to his Subjects? Is he not Lord over their
Consciences? And are not these Powers as truly
appropriated to God? And has not your Lord∣ship
often taught them to be so, as that of <HI>For∣giveness
of Sins?</HI> Is it not as much the Prerogative
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
of God to have any natural intrinsick Power, to
confer Grace, or any Spiritual Benefit to the Souls
of Men, as to forgive Sins? Has not your Lord∣ship
despis'd all the Administrations of the Cler∣gy,
because God's Graces can only come from
himself, and are only to be receiv'd from his own
Hands? The Conclusion therefore is this, either
Christ has a Personal intrinsick Power to confer
Grace in his Kingdom, or he has not; if you say
he has not, then you are chargable with the
Collusion of making him a King in a Spiritual
Kingdom, where you allow him no Spiritual
Power: If you say he has, then you fall into this
Contradiction, that you allow him to have Di∣vine
Powers, tho' he cannot have Divine Pow∣ers;
that is, you allow him to <HI>give Grace,</HI> tho' it
is a Divine Power, and not to <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> be∣cause
it is a Divine Power. My Lord, I wish
your Laity (if there be any to whom you can
render it intelligible) much Joy of such profound
Divinity. Or if there are others who are more
taken with your Lordship's Sincerity, I desire
them not to pass by this following remarkable In∣stance
of it: Your Lordship has here as plainly
declar'd, as Words can consequentially declare
any thing, that you do not believe Christ to be
God, yet profess your self Bishop of a Church,
whofse Liturgy in so many repeated Testimonies
declares the contrary Doctrine, and which obli∣ges
you to express your Assent and Consent to
such Doctrine. My Lord, I here call upon your
<HI>Sincerity,</HI> either Declare Christ to be Perfect God,
and then shew why he could not <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> or
Deny him to be Perfect God, and then shew how
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
you can sincerely declare your <HI>Assent</HI> and <HI>Consent</HI>
to the Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This, my Lord, has an Appearance of Preva∣rication,
which you cannot, I hope, charge upon
any of your Adversaries; who if they cannot think,
that to be sincere is the only thing necessary to re∣commend
Men to the Favour of God, yet may
have as much, or possibly more Sincerity, than
those who do think so.</P>
<P>Before I take leave of your Lordship, I must take
Notice of a <HI>Resting-Place,</HI> a <HI>strong Retreat a lasting
Foundation,</HI> i. e. <HI>a Demonstration in the strictest Sense of</HI>
the Words, that all <HI>Church-Communion</HI> is unnecessary.</P>
<P>Your Lordship sets it out in these Words.</P>
<Q><P>I am not now going to accuse you of a Heresie against
Charity, but of a Heresie against the Possibility and Na∣ture
of Things. <HI>As thus,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nelson</HI> (for Instance)
thinks himself oblig'd in Conscience to Communicate
with some of our Church. Upon this you declare he
hath no Title to God's Mercy; and you and all the World
allow, that if he communicates with you whilst his Con∣science
tells him it is a Sin, he is self-condemn'd and out
os God's Favour. That Notion, (viz. <HI>the Necessity
of Church-Communion</HI>) therefore, which implies
this great invincible Absurdity, cannot be true.</P></Q>
<P>Pray, my Lord, what is this wond'rous Curi∣osity
of a <HI>Demonstration,</HI> but the common Case
of an <HI>erroneous Conscience?</HI> Did the strictest Con∣tenders
for Church-Communion ever teach, <HI>that
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
any Terms</HI> are to be comply'd with against Con∣science?
But its a strange Conclusion to infer
from thence, that there is no Obligation to
Communion, or that all Things are to be held
indifferent, because they are not to be comply'd
with against one's Conscience.</P>
<P>The Truths of the Christian Religion have the
same Nature and Obligation, whatever our Opini∣ons
are of them, and those that are necessary
to be believed, continue so, whither we can
perswade our selves to believe them or not. I
suppose your Lordship will not say, that the Ar∣ticles
of Faith and necessary Institutions of the
Christian Religion, are no otherways necessary,
than because we believe them to be so, that our
Perswasion is the only Cause of the Necessity; but
if their Necessity be not owing merely to our
belief of them, then it is certain that our Dis∣belief
of them, cannot make them less necessa∣ry.
If the Ordinances of Christ, and the Ar∣ticles
of Faith are necessary, because Christ has
made them so, that Necessity must continue the
same, whether we believe and observe them or
not.</P>
<P>So that, my Lord, we may still maintain the
necessity of Church-Communion, and the strict
observance of Christ's Ordinances, notwith∣standing
that People have different perswasions
in these Matters, presuming <HI>that our Opinions</HI> can
no more alter the nature or necessity of Christ's
Institutions, than we can believe <HI>Error</HI> into <HI>Truth,
Good</HI> into <HI>Evil,</HI> or <HI>Light</HI> into <HI>Darkness.</HI> I shall
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
think my self no <HI>Heretick against the Nature of
Things,</HI> tho' I tell a <HI>Conscientious Socinian,</HI> that the
Divinity of Christ is necessary to be believed,
or a <HI>Conscientious Jew,</HI> that it is necessary to be
a Christian in order to be saved. But if your
Lordships Demonstration was accepted, we
should be oblig'd to give up the necessity of
every Doctrine and Institution, to every Dis∣believer
that pretended Conscience. We must
not tell any Party of People, that they are in
any danger for being out of Communion with
us, if they do but follow their own Perswa∣sion.</P>
<P>Your Lordship's <HI>Invincible Demonstration</HI> pro∣ceeds
thus.</P>
<P>We must not insist upon the Necessity of joyning with
any particular Church, because then Conscientious Per∣sons
will be in Danger either way; for if there be a
Necessity of it, then there is a Danger if they do not
joyn with it, and if they comply against their Consci∣ences,
the Danger is the same.</P>
<P>What an inextricable Difficulty is here! How
shall Divinity or Logick be able to relieve us!</P>
<P>Be pleas'd my Lord, to accept of this Solu∣tion
in lieu of your Demonstration.</P>
<P>I will suppose the Case of a <HI>Conscientious Jew;</HI>
I tell him that Christianity is the only covenan∣ted
Method of Salvation, and that he can have
no Title to the Favour of God, 'till he professes
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
the Faith of Christ. What, replies he, would
you direct me to do? If I embrace Christianity
against my Conscience, I am out of God's Fa∣vour,
and if I follow my Conscience, and con∣tinue
a <HI>Jew,</HI> I am also out of his Favour. The
Answer is this, my Lord; The <HI>Jew</HI> is to obey
his Conscience, and to be left to the <HI>uncovenan∣ted,
unpromised</HI> Terms of God's <HI>Mercy,</HI> whilst the
Conscientious Christian is entitled to the <HI>express
and promised favours of</HI> God.</P>
<P>There is still the same absolute necessity of
believing in Christ, Christianity is still the only
Method of Salvation; tho' the sincere <HI>Jew</HI> can∣not
so perswade himself; and we ought to de∣clare
it to all <HI>Jews</HI> and Unbelievers whatsoever,
that they can only be sav'd by embracing Christi∣anity.
That a false Religion, does not become
a true one; nor a true one false, in Conse∣quence
of their Opinions; but that if they are
so unhappy, as to refuse the Covenant of Grace,
they must be left to such <HI>Mercy</HI> as is without any
Covenant. And now, my Lord, what is be∣come
of this mighty Demonstration? Does it
prove that Christianity is not necessary, because
the Conscientious <HI>Jew</HI> may think it is not so?
It may as well prove, that the Moon is no larger
than a Man's Head, because an honest ignorant
Countryman may think it no larger.</P>
<P>Is there any Person of <HI>Common Sense,</HI> who
would think it a Demonstration, that he is not
obliged to go to Church, because a <HI>Conscienti∣ous</HI>
Dissenter will not? Could he think it less
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
necessary to be a Christian, because a <HI>sincere Jew</HI>
cannot embrace Christianity? Could he take it
to be an indifferent Matter, whether he believed
the Divinity of Christ, because a <HI>Conscientious
Socinian</HI> cannot? Yet this is your Lordship's <HI>in∣vincible
Demonstration,</HI> that we ought not to
insist upon the necessity of Church-Commu∣nion,
because a <HI>Conscientious Disbeliever</HI> cannot
comply with it.</P>
<P>A small Degree of <HI>Common Sense,</HI> would teach
a Man that true Religion, and the Terms of
Salvation must have the same obligatory Force,
whether we reason rightly about them or not;
and that they who believe and practice accor∣ding
to them, are in express Covenant with
God, which entitles them to his Favour; whilst
those who are sincerely Erronious, have nothing
but the sincerity of their Errors to plead, and
are left to such Mercy of God, as is without any
Promise. Here, my Lord, is nothing frightful
or absurd in this Doctrine, they who are in the
Church which Christ has founded, are upon
Terms which entitles them to God's Favour;
they who are out of it, fall to his Mercy.</P>
<P>But your Lordship is not content with the
Terms of the Gospel, or a Doctrine that only
saves a particular Sort of People; this is a nar∣row
View, not wide enough for your Notions
of <HI>Liberty.</HI> Particular Religions, and particular
Covenants, are <HI>demonstrated</HI> to be absurd, <HI>because</HI>
particular Persons may Dis-believe, or not sub∣mit
to them.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
Your Lordship must have Doctrines that will
save all People alike, in every way that their
Perswasion leads them to take: But, my Lord,
there needs be no greater Demonstration against
your Lordship's Doctrine, than that it equally fa∣vours
every way of Worship; for an Argument
which equally proves every Thing, has been ge∣nerally
thought to prove nothing; which hap∣pens
to be the Case of your Lordship's <HI>Impor∣tant
Demonstration.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lordship indeed only instances in a par∣ticular
Person, Mr. <HI>Nelson;</HI> but your <HI>Demonstrati∣on</HI>
is as serviceable to any other Person who has
left any other Church whatever. The <HI>Conscien∣tious
Quaker, Muggletonian, Independant,</HI> or <HI>Socini∣an,</HI>
&amp;c. have the same right to obey Conscience,
and blame any Church that assumes a Power of
censuring them, as Mr. <HI>Nelson</HI> had; and if they
are censur'd by any Church, that Church is
as guilty of the same <HI>Heresie against the Nature of
Things,</HI> as that Church which censur'd Mr. <HI>Nel∣son,</HI>
or any Church that should pretend to cen∣sure
any other Person whatever.</P>
<P>I am not at all Surpriz'd, that your Lordship
should teach this Doctrine, but its something
strange, that such an Argument should be ob∣truded
upon the World as an unheard of <HI>De∣monstration,</HI>
and that in an <HI>Appeal to common Sense.</HI>
Suppose some Body or other in defence of your
Lordship, should take upon him to demonstrate
to the World, that there is no such Thing as
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
Colour, because there are some People that
can't see it; or Sounds, because there are some
who don't hear them; He would have found out
the only <HI>Demonstrations</HI> in the World that could
equal your Lordships, and would have as much
reason to call those <HI>Hereticks against the Nature of
Things,</HI> who should dis-believe him, and insist
upon the reality of Sounds, as your Lordship has
to call your Adversaries so.</P>
<P>For, is there no necessity of Church-Commu∣nion,
because there are some who don't con∣ceive
it? Then there are no Sounds, because
there are some who don't hear them; for it is
certainly as easie to believe away the <HI>Truth</HI> and
<HI>Reality,</HI> as the <HI>Necessity</HI> of Things.</P>
<P>Some People have only taught us the <HI>innocency
of Error,</HI> and been content with setting forth its
harmless Qualities; but your Lordship has been
a more hearty Advocate, and given it a <HI>Power</HI>
over every Truth and Institution of Christiani∣ty.
If we have but an <HI>erronious Conscience,</HI> the
whole Christian Dispensation is cancell'd; all
the Truth and Doctrines in the Bible are <HI>De∣monstrated</HI>
to be unnecessary, if we do not be∣lieve
them.</P>
<P>How unhappily have the several Parties of
Christians been disputing for many Ages, who
if they could but have found out this <HI>intelligible
Demonstration,</HI> (from the Case of an erroneous
Conscience) would have seen the absurdity of
pretending to necessary Doctrines, and insisting
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
upon <HI>Church-Communion;</HI> but it must be acknow∣ledged
your Lordship's <HI>new invented Engine</HI> for
the Destruction of <HI>Churches;</HI> and it may be expect∣ed
the <HI>good Christians of no Church</HI> will return your
Lordship their Thanks for it.</P>
<P>Your Lordship has thought it a mighty Ob∣jection
to some Doctrines in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
that the Papists might make some Advan∣tage
of them: But yet your own Doctrine de∣fends
<HI>all</HI> Communions alike, and serves the <HI>Jew</HI>
and <HI>Socinian, &amp;c.</HI> as much as any other sort of
People. Tho' this sufficiently appears, from
what has been already said, yet that it may be
still more obvious to the <HI>Common Sense</HI> of every
one, I shall reduce these Doctrines to Practice,
and suppose for once, that your Lordship intends
to convert a Jew, a Quaker, or Socinian.</P>
<P>Now in order to make a Convert of any of
them, these Preliminary PROPOSITIONS
are to be first laid down according to your Lord∣ship's
Doctrine.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Propositions</HI> for the Improvement of true
Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Proposition</HI> I. That we are neither more or less
in the Favour of God, for living in any parti∣cular
Method or Way of Worship, but purely as
we are sincere. <HI>Preserv.</HI> page 90.</P>
<P><HI>Propos.</HI> II. That no Church ought to unchurch
another, or declare it out of God's Favour.
<HI>Preserv.</HI> p. 85.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80"/>
<HI>Propos.</HI> III. That nothing loses us the Favour
of God, but a wicked Insincerity. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Propos.</HI> IV. That a conscientious Person can
be in no Danger for being out of any particular
Church. <HI>Preserv.</HI> page 90.</P>
<P><HI>Propos.</HI> V. That there is no such Thing as any
real Perfection or Excellency in any Religion,
that can <HI>justify</HI> our adhering to it, but that all is
founded in our Personal Persuasion. Which your
Lordship thus proves, <HI>When we left the Popish Do∣ctrines,
was it because they were</HI> actually <HI>corrupt?</HI>
No; <HI>The Reason was, because we thought them so.</HI>
Therefore if we might leave the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI>
not because her Doctrines were corrupt, but be∣cause
we thought them so, then the same Rea∣son
will justify any one else, in leaving any
Church, how true soever its Doctrines are; and
consequently there is no such Thing, as any <HI>real</HI>
Perfection or Excellency in any Religion con∣sider'd
in it self, but it is <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong</HI> according
to our Perswasions about it. <HI>Preserv.</HI> page 85.</P>
<P><HI>Propos.</HI> VI. That Christ is <HI>sole</HI> King and <HI>Law∣giver</HI>
in his Kingdom, that no <HI>Men</HI> have any
Power of Legislation in it; that if we would be
good Members of it, we must shew our selves
Subjects of Christ alone, without any Regard to
Man's Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Propos.</HI> VII. That as Christ's Kingdom is not
of this World, so when Worldly Encouragements
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
are annexed to it, these are so many Divisions
against Christ and his own express Word. <HI>Serm.</HI>
page 11.</P>
<P><HI>Propos.</HI> VIII. That to pretend to know the
Hearts and Sincerity of Men, is Nonsense and
Absurdity. <HI>Serm.</HI> page 93.</P>
<P><HI>Propos.</HI> IX. That God's Graces are only to be
receiv'd immediately from himself. <HI>Serm,</HI> p. 89.</P>
<P>These, my Lord, are your Lordships own Pro∣positions,
expressed in your own Terms without
any Exaggeration.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, begin as soon as you
please, either with a <HI>Quaker, Socinian,</HI> or <HI>Jew;</HI>
use any Argument whatsoever to convert them,
and you shall have a sufficient Answer from your
own Propositions.</P>
<P>Will you tell the <HI>Jew</HI> that Christianity is ne∣cessary
to Salvation? <HI>He will answer from</HI>
Propos. I. That we are neither more or lesas in the Fa∣vour
of God, for living in any particular Method or
way of Worship, but purely as we are Sincere.</P>
<P>Will your Lordship tell him, that the Truth of
Christianity is so well asserted, that there is no
Excuse left for Unbelievers? He will answer
from <HI>Propos.</HI> V. <HI>That all Religion is founded in per∣sonal
Persuasion; that as your Lordship does not believe
that Christ is come, because he is actually come, but
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
because you think he is come; so He does not disbelieve
Christ because he is not actually come, but because he
thinks he is not come.</HI> So that here, my Lord, the
<HI>Jew</HI> gives as good a reason why he is not a Chri∣stian,
as your Lordship does why you are not a
Papist.</P>
<P>If your Lordship should turn the Discourse to
a <HI>Quaker,</HI> and offer him any Reasons for Em∣bracing
the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI>
you can't possibly have any better Success;
any one may see from your <HI>Propositions,</HI> that no
Argument can be urg'd but what your Lordship
has there fully answered. For since you allow
nothing to the <HI>Truth</HI> of Doctrines, or the <HI>Ex∣cellency</HI>
of any Communion as such, it is de∣monstrable
that no Church or Communion can
have any Advantage above another, which is
absolutely necessary in order to persuade any
sensible Man to exchange any Communion for
another.</P>
<P>Will your Lordship tell a <HI>Quaker</HI> that there is
any Danger in that particular Way that he is in?</P>
<P>He can answer from <HI>Propos.</HI> lst, 3d, and 4th.
<HI>That a Conscientious Person can't be in any Danger for
being out of any particular Church.</HI></P>
<P>Will your Lordship tell him that his Religion is
condemned by the Universal Church?</P>
<P>He can answer from <HI>Propos.</HI> 2d, <HI>That no Church
ought to unchurch another, or declare it out of God's
Favour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
Will you tell him that Christ has instituted
Sacraments as <HI>necessary Means</HI> of Grace, which he
neglects to Observe?</P>
<P>He will answer you from <HI>Propos.</HI> IX. <HI>That God's
Graces are only to be received</HI> immediately from him∣self.
And to think that <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> or the
sprinkling of Water is necessary to Salvation, is
as absurd, as to think any Order of the Clergy,
is necessary to recommend us to God.</P>
<P>Will your Lordship tell him that he displeases
God, by not holding several Articles of Faith,
which Christ has required us to believe?</P>
<P>He can reply from <HI>Propos.</HI> III. <HI>That nothing
loses us the Favour of God</HI> but a <HI>wicked Insincerity.</HI>
And from <HI>Propos.</HI> V. That as your Lordship be∣lieves
such Things, not because they are actually
to be believ'd, but because you think so; so he
disbelieves them, not because they are actually
false, but because he thinks so.</P>
<P>Will your Lordship tell him he is insincere?</P>
<P>He can reply from <HI>Propos.</HI> VI. <HI>That to assume to
know the Hearts and Sincerity of Men, is Nonsense and
Blasphemy.</HI></P>
<P>Will your Lordship tell him that he ought to
conform to a Church establish'd by the Laws of
the Land?</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84"/>
He can answer from <HI>Propos.</HI> VIII. that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
very <HI>Establishment</HI> is an Argument against Con∣formity,
<HI>For as Christ's Kingdom is not of this Worl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
so when Worldly-Encouragements are annexed to it, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
are somany Decisions against Christ, and his own ex∣press
Words.</HI> And from <HI>Propos.</HI> VII. <HI>That seeing
Christ is sole King and Lawgiver in his Kingdom, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
no M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n have any Power of Legislation in it, they wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would be good Members of it, must shew themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Subjects to Christ alone, without any Regard to Man's
Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I am inclin'd to think, my Lord, that it is
now <HI>demonstrated</HI> to the common Sense of the
Laity, that your Lordship cannot urge any Ar∣gument,
either from the <HI>Truth,</HI> the <HI>Advantage,</HI>
or <HI>Necessity</HI> of embracing the Doctrines of the
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> to either <HI>Jew, Heretick,</HI> or
<HI>Schismatick,</HI> but you have help'd him to a full
Answer to any such Argument, from your own
<HI>Principles.</HI></P>
<P>Are we, my Lord, to be treated as <HI>Popishly af∣fected</HI>
for asserting some Truths, which the Pa∣pists
join with us in asserting? Is it a Crime in us
not to drop some necessary Doctrines, because
the Papists have not dropt them? If <HI>this</HI> is to be
popishly affected, we own the Charge, and are
not for being such <HI>true Protestants,</HI> as to give up
the <HI>Apostles Creed,</HI> or lay aside the Sacraments,
because they are receiv'd by the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI>
I cannot indeed charge your Lordship with being
<HI>well affected</HI> to the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> or of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Quakers,</HI> Or <HI>Socinians,</HI> but this I
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave <HI>demonstrated,</HI> and will undertake the De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce
of it, that your Lordships <HI>Principles</HI> equally
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rve them all alike, and don't give the least Ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antage
to one Church above another, as has
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fficiently appeared from your <HI>Principles.</HI></P>
<P>I will no more say your Lordship is in the In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest
of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> or <HI>Socinians,</HI> or <HI>Papists,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han I would charge you with being in the In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for as your Do∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trines
equally support them all, he ought to ask
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Lordship's Pardon, who should declare you
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ore a Friend to one than the other.</P>
<P>I intended, my Lord, to have considered an∣other
very obnoxious Article in your Lordship's
Doctrines, concerning the <HI>Repugnancy of temporal
Encouragements to the Nature of Christ's Kingdom;</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Consistency and Reasonableness of guard∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng
this Spiritual Kingdom with human Laws,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as been defended with so much Perspicuity and
Strength of Argument, and your Lordship's Ob∣jections
so fully confuted by the judicious and
learned Dean of <HI>Chichester,</HI> that I presume this
Part of the Controversie is finally determined.</P>
<P>I hope, my Lord, that I have delivered no∣thing
here, that needs any Excuse or Apology
to the Laity, that they will not be perswaded,
thro' any vain Pretence of Liberty, to make
themselves Parties against the first Principles of
Christianity; or imagine, that whilst we con∣tend
for the positive Institutions of the Gospel,
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
the Necessity of Church-Communion, or the
Excellency of our own, we are robbing them of
their natural Rights, or interfering with their
Privileges. Whilst we appear in the Defence of
any part of Christianity, we are engag'd for them
in the common Cause of Christians. and I am
perswaded better things of the Laity, than to be∣lieve
that such Labours will render either our
Persons or Professions hateful to them. Your
Lordship has indeed endeavoured to give an in∣vidious
Turn to the Controversie, by calling upon
the Laity to assert their Libertys, as if they were
in Danger from the Principles of Christianity.
—But, my Lord, what Liberty does, any Lay∣man
lose, by our asserting, that <HI>Church-Com∣munion</HI>
is necessary? What Privilege is taken
from them by our teaching the Danger of certain
Ways and Methods of Religion? Is a Man made
a Slave because he is caution'd against the Prin∣ciples
of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> against <HI>Fanaticism, Popery,</HI> or
<HI>Socinianism?</HI> Is he in a State of Bondage, because
the Sacraments are necessary, and none but Epi∣scopal
Clergy ought to administer them? Is his
Freedom destroy'd because there is a particular
Order of Men appointed by God to minister in
Holy Things, and be serviceable to him in re∣commending
him to the Favour of God? Can
any Persons, my Lord, think these things
breaches upon their Liberty, except such as
think the Commandments a Burden? Is there
any more Hardship in saying, thou shalt keep to
an Episcopal Church, than thou shalt be bap∣tiz'd?
Or in requiring People to receive parti∣cular
Sacraments, than to believe particular
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
Books of Scripture to be the Word of God?
If some other Advocate for the Laity, should,
out of Zeal for their Rights, declare that they
need not believe one half of the Articles in the
Creed; if they would but assert their Liberty,
He would be as true a Friend, and deserve the
same Applause, as he who should assert the Ne∣cessity
of Church-Communion, is inconsistent
with the natural Rights and Liberties of Man∣kind.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="postscript">
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I Hope your Lordship will not think it Unna∣tural
or Impertinent, to offer here a word
or two in answer to some Objections against my
former Letter.</P>
<P>To begin with the Doctrine of the uninter∣rupted
Succession of the Clergy.</P>
<P>I have, as I think, prov'd that there is a Di∣vine
Sommission requir'd to qualifie any one to
exercise the Priestly Office, and that seeing this
Divine Commission can only be had from such
particular Persons as God has appointed to give
it, therefore it is necessary that there should be
a continual Succession of such Persons, in or∣der
to keep up a Commission'd Order of the
Clergy. For if the Commission it self be to
descend thro' Ages; and distinguish the Clergy
from the Laity; it is certain the Persons who
alone can give this Commission must descend
thro' the same Ages, and Consequently an un∣interrupted
Succession is as necessary, as that
the Clergy have a Divine Commission. Take
away this Succession, and the Clergy may as
well be Ordain'd by one Person as another; a
Number of Women may as well give them a
Divine Commission, as a Congregation of any
Men, they may indeed appoint Persons to Offi∣ciate
in Holy Orders, for the sake of <HI>Decency</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
and <HI>Order;</HI> but then there is no more in it, than
an external <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Order,</HI> they are no more
the Priests of <HI>God,</HI> then those that pretended
to make them so. If we had lost the Scrip∣tures,
it would be very well to make as good
Books as we could, and come as near them as
possible; but then it would be not only Folly,
but Presumption, to call them the Word of
God. But I proceed to the Objections against
the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succession.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is said, that there is no mention made
of it in Scripture, as having any relation to the
being of a Church.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is subject to so great Uncer∣tainty,
that if it be necessary, we can't now be
sure we are in the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That it is a Popish Doctrine, and gives
them great Advantage over us.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>1st</HI> Objection, that there
is no mention made of it in the Scriptures,
which tho' I think 1 have sufficiently answer'd in
this Letter, I shall here farther consider.</P>
<P>Pray, my Lord, is it not a true Doctrine, that
<HI>the Scriptures contain all things necessary to Salvation?</HI>
But, my Lord, it is no where expresly said, that
<HI>the Scriptures contain all things necessary to Salvation.</HI>
It is no where said, that no other Articles of Faith
need be believed. Where does it appear in Scri∣pture,
that the Scriptures were writ by any Di∣vine
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
Command? Have any of the Gospels or
Epistles this Authority to recommend them?
Are they necessary to be believ'd, because there
is any Law of Christ concerning the Necessity of
believing them?</P>
<P>May I reject this uninterrupted Succession,
because it is not mention'd in Scripture? And
may I not as well reject all the Gospels? Pro∣duce
your Authority, my Lord, mention your
Texts of Scripture, where Christ has <HI>hung the
Salvation of Men</HI> upon their believing, that
St. <HI>Matthew</HI> or St. <HI>John</HI> wrote such a Book seven∣teen
Hundred Years ago. These, my Lord, are
<HI>Niceties</HI> and <HI>Trifles</HI> which are not to be found in
Scripture, and consequently have nothing to do
with the Salvation of Men.</P>
<P>Now if nothing be to be held as necessary, but
what is expresly required in so many Words in Scri∣pture,
then it can never be prov'd that the Scri∣ptures
themselves are a <HI>standing Rule of Faith in all
Ages,</HI> since it is no where expresly asserted, nor
is it any where said, that the Scriptures should
be continued as a Rule of Faith in all Ages. Is
it an Objection against the Necessity of a perpe∣tual
Succession of the Clergy, that it is not men∣tion'd
in the Scripture? And is it not as good
a one against the <HI>Necessity</HI> of making Scripture the
<HI>standing Rule of Faith in all Ages,</HI> since it is never
said, that they were to be continu'd as a standing
Rule in all Ages? If things are only necessary
for being said to be so in Scripture, then all that
are not thus taught are equally unnecessary, and
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
consequently it is no more necessary that the
Scripture should be a fix'd Rule of Faith in all
Ages, than that there should be Bishops to ordain
in all Ages.</P>
<P>Again, where shall we find it in Scripture, that
the Sacraments are to be continued in every Age
of the Church? Where is it said, that they shall
always be the ordinary Means of Grace necessary
to be observ'd? Is there any Law of Christ, any
Text of Scripture, that expresly asserts, that if
we leave the Use of the Sacraments, we are out
of Covenant with God? Is it any where di∣rectly
said, that we must never lay them aside,
or that they will be <HI>perpetually</HI> necessary? No,
my Lord, this is a <HI>Nicety</HI> and <HI>Trifle</HI> not to be <HI>found
in Scripture: There is no Stress laid there upon this
Matter,</HI> but upon things <HI>of a quite different: Na∣ture.</HI></P>
<P>I now presume, my Lord, that every one who
has common Sense plainly sees, that if this Suc∣cession
of the Clergy be to be despis'd, because
it is not expresly requir'd in Scripture; it unde∣niably
follows, that we may reject the Scriptures,
as not being a <HI>standing Rule of Faith in all Ages;</HI> we
way disuse the Sacraments, as not the <HI>Ordinary
Means of Grace in all Ages;</HI> since this is no more
mentioned in the Scriptures, or <HI>expresly</HI> requir'd,
than this uninterrupted Succession.</P>
<P>If it be a good Argument against the Necessity
of Episcopal Ordainers, that it is never said in
Scripture, that there shall <HI>always</HI> be such Ordainers;
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
it is certainly as conclusive against the Use
of the Sacraments in every Age, that it is no
where said in Scripture they shall be used in
<HI>All Ages.</HI></P>
<P>If no Government or Order of the Clergy be
to be held as necessary, because no such Neces∣sity
is asserted in Scripture; it is certain this con∣cludes
as strongly against <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>the
Order it self,</HI> as against any <HI>Particular</HI> Order. For
it is no more said in Scripture, that there shall be
an Order of Clergy, than that there shall be any
<HI>particular</HI> Order; therefore if this Silence proves
against any <HI>particular</HI> Order of Clergy, it proves
as much against <HI>Order it self.</HI></P>
<P>Should therefore any of your Lordship's
Friends have so much Church-Zeal as to con∣tend
for the Necessity of <HI>some Order,</HI> tho' of no
particular Order; he must fall under your Lord∣ship's
Displeasure, and be prov'd as meer a
<HI>Dreamer</HI> and <HI>Trifler,</HI> as those who assert the Neces∣sity
of Episcopal Ordination. For if it be plain,
that there need be no <HI>Episcopal Clergy,</HI> because it
is not said there shall <HI>always</HI> be Episcopal Clergy;
it is undeniably plain, that there need be <HI>no Order</HI>
of the Clergy, since it is no where said, there
shall be <HI>an Order</HI> of Clergy: Therefore whoever
shall contend for an Order of Clergy, will be as
much condemn'd by your Lordship's Doctrine,
as he that declares for the Episcopal Clergy.</P>
<P>The Truth of the Matter is this, If nothing is
to be esteemed of any Moment, but counted as
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
mere <HI>Trifle</HI> and <HI>Nicety</HI> among Christians, which
is not <HI>expresly</HI> requir'd in the Scriptures; then it
is a <HI>Trifle</HI> and <HI>Nicety,</HI> whether we believe the
Scripture to be a <HI>standing Rule of Faith</HI> in all Ages,
whether we use the Sacraments in <HI>all Ages,</HI> whe∣ther
we have any Clergy at all, whether we ob∣serve
the Lord's Day, whether we baptize our
Children, or whether we go to publick Worship;
for none of these things are expresly required in
so many Words in Scripture. But if your Lordship,
with the rest of the Christian World, will take
these things to be of Moment, and well prov'd,
because they are founded in Scripture, tho' not
in <HI>express Terms,</HI> or under <HI>plain Commands;</HI> if you
will acknowledge these Matters to be well assert∣ed,
because they may be gather'd from Scripture,
and are confirm'd by the universal Practice of the
Church in all Ages, (which is all the Proof that
they are capable of) I don't doubt but it will
appear, that this <HI>successive Order of the Clergy</HI> is
founded on the same Evidence, and supported
by as great Authority, so that it must be thought
of the same Moment with these things, by all
unprejudic'd Persons.</P>
<P>For, my Lord, tho' it be not expresly said, that
there shall <HI>always</HI> be a <HI>Succession of Episcopal Clergy,</HI>
yet it is a Truth founded in Scripture it self, and
asserted by the universal Voice of Tradition in
the first and succeeding Ages of the Church.</P>
<P>It is thus founded in Scripture: There we are
taught that, the Priesthood is a <HI>Positive Institution;</HI>
that no Man can take this Office unto himself;
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
that neither our Saviour himself, nor his Apostles,
nor any other Person, however extraordinarily en∣dow'd
with Gifts from God, could, <HI>as such,</HI> exer∣cise
the Priestly Office, till they had God's ex∣press
Commission for that purpose. Now how
does it appear, that the Sacraments are Positive
Institutions, but that they are consecrated to such
Ends and Effects, as of themselves they were no
way qualify'd to perform? Now as it appears
from Scripture, that Men, <HI>as such,</HI> however en∣dow'd,
were not qualify'd to take this Office up∣on
them without God's Appointment; it is de∣monstratively
certain, that Men so call'd are as
much to be esteem'd a <HI>Positive Institution,</HI> as Ele∣ments
so chosen can be call'd a <HI>Positive Institution.</HI>
All the Personal Abilities of Men conferring no
more Authority to exercise the Office of a
Clergy-Man, than the natural Qualities of Water
to make a Sacrament: So that the one Institu∣tion
is as truly Positive as the other.</P>
<P>Again. The Order of the Clergy is not only a
<HI>Positive</HI> Order instituted by God, but the diffe∣rent
Degrees in this Order is of the same Nature.
For we find in Scripture, that some Persons could
perform some Offices in the Priesthood, which
neither Deacons nor Priests could do, tho' those
Deacons and Priests were inspir'd Persons, and
Workers of Miracles. Thus <HI>Timothy</HI> was sent to
ordain Elders, because none below his Order,
who was a Bishop, could perform that Office.
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> laid their Hands on baptiz'd Per∣sons,
because neither Priests nor Deacons, tho'
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
Workers of Miracles, could execute that Part of
the Sacerdotal Office.</P>
<P>Now can we imagine that the Apostles and
Bishops thus distinguish'd themselves for no∣thing?
That there was the same Power in <HI>Dea∣cons</HI>
and <HI>Priests</HI> to execute those Offices, tho' they
took them to themselves? No, my Lord; if
three Degrees in the Ministry are instituted in
Scripture, we are oblig'd to think them as truly
distinct in their Powers, as we are to think that
the Priesthood it self contains Powers that are
distinct from those of the Laity. It is no more
consistent with Scripture, to say that <HI>Deacons</HI> or
<HI>Priests</HI> may ordain, than that the Laity are Priests
or Deacons. The same Divine Institution mak∣ing
as truly a Difference betwixt the Clergy, as
it does betwixt Clergy and Laity.</P>
<P>Now if the Order of the Clergy be a <HI>Divine
Positive</HI> Institution, in which there are different
Degrees of Power, where some alone can Or∣dain,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> whilst others can only perform other
parts of the sacred Office; if this (as it plainly
appears) be a Doctrine of Scripture, then it is a
Doctrine of Scripture, that there is a Necessity of
such a Succession of Men as have Power to or∣dain.
For do the Scriptures make it necessary
that <HI>Timothy</HI> (or some Bishop) should be sent to
<HI>Ephesus</HI> to ordain Priests, because the Priests who
were there could not ordain? And do not the
same Scriptures make it as necessary, that <HI>Timo∣thy</HI>'s
Successor be the only Ordainer, as well as
He was in his Time? Will not Priests in the
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
next Age be as destitute of the Power of Ordain∣ing,
as when <HI>Timothy</HI> was alive? So that since
the Scriptures teach, that <HI>Timothy,</HI> or Persons of
his Order, could <HI>alone</HI> ordain in that Age; they
as plainly teach, that the Successors of that Or∣der
can <HI>alone</HI> ordain in any Age, and conse∣quently
the Scriptures plainly teach a Necessity
of an <HI>Episcopal Succession.</HI></P>
<P>The Scriptures declare there is a Necessity of
a Divine Commission to execute the Office of a
Priest; they also teach, that this Commission
can only be had from particular Persons: There∣fore
the Scriptures plainly teach, there is a Ne∣cessity
of a <HI>Succession of such Particular Persons,</HI> in
order to keep up a truly <HI>Commission'd Clergy.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose when <HI>Timothy</HI> was sent to <HI>Ephesus</HI> to
ordain Elders, the Church had told him, We
have chose Elders already, and laid our Hands
upon them: That if he alone was allowed to
exercise this Power, it might seem as if he
alone had it; or that Ministers were the better
for being ordain'd by his particular Hands; and
that some Persons might imagine they could have
no Clergy, except they were ordain'd by him,
or some of his Order; and that seeing Christ had
no where made an express Law, that such Per∣sons
should be necessary to the Ordination of the
Clergy; therefore they rejected this Authority
of <HI>Timothy,</HI> lest they should subject themselves to
<HI>Niceties</HI> and <HI>Trifles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97"/>
Will your Lordship say, that such a Practice
would have been allow'd of in the <HI>Ephesians?</HI>
Or that Ministers so ordained, would have been
receiv'd as the Ministers of Christ? If not, why
must such Practice or such Ministers be allow'd of
in any after-Ages? Would not the same Proceed∣ing
against any of <HI>Timothy's Successors,</HI> have de∣serv'd
the same Censure, as being equally un∣lawful.
If therefore the Scripture condemns all
Ordination but what is Episcopal; the Scriptures
make a <HI>Succession</HI> of <HI>Episcopal Ordainers</HI> necessary.
So that I hope, my Lord, we shall be no more
told that this is a Doctrine not mention'd in
Scripture, or without any Foundation in it.</P>
<P>The great Objection to this Doctrine is, that
this <HI>Episcopal Order of the Clergy,</HI> is only an Apo∣stolical
Practice; and seeing <HI>all</HI> Apostolical Pra∣ctices
are not binding to us, sure this need not.</P>
<P>In answer to this, my Lord, I shall first shew,
that tho' all Apostolical Practices are not neces∣sary,
yet some may be necessary. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
the Divine unalterable Right of Episcopacy is
not founded <HI>merely</HI> on Apostolical Practice.</P>
<P>To begin with the <HI>First;</HI> The Objection runs
thus, <HI>All Apostolical Practices, are not unalterable or
obligatory to us, therefore no Apostolical Practices are.</HI>
This, my Lord, is just as Theological, as if I
should say all Scripture-Truths are not Articles
of Faith, or Fundamentals of Religion, therefore
no Scripture-Truths are: Is not the Argument
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
full as just and solid in one Case as the Other?
May there not be that same Difference between
some Practices of the Apostles and others, that
there is betwixt some Scripture-Truths and o∣thers?
Are all Truths equally important that are
to be found in the Bible? Why must all Practices
be of the same Moment that were Apostolical?
Now if there be any Way, either divine or hu∣mane,
of knowing an Article of Faith, from the
smallest Truth or most indifferent Matter in
Scripture, they will equally assist us in distinguish∣ing
what Apostolical Practices are of perpetual
Obligation, and what are not. But it is a strange
way of Reasoning, that some People are fallen
into, who seem to know nothing of <HI>Moderation,</HI>
but jump as constantly out of one Extream into
another, as if there was no such Thing as a middle
Way, or any such Virtue as <HI>Moderation.</HI> Thus
either the Church must have an <HI>absolute uncontroul∣able
Authority,</HI> or none at all; we must either hold
<HI>all</HI> Apostolical Practices necessary, or <HI>none at all.</HI></P>
<P>Again, if no Apostolical <HI>Practices</HI> can be unal∣terable,
because all are not, then no Apostolical
<HI>Doctrines</HI> are necessary to be taught in all Ages,
because all Apostolical <HI>Doctrines</HI> are not; and we
are no more oblig'd to teach the <HI>Death, Satis∣faction</HI>
and <HI>Resurrection</HI> of Jesus Christ, than we
are oblig'd to forbid the <HI>eating of Blood and Things
strangled.</HI> If we must thus blindly follow them
in all their Practices, or else be at liberty to leave
them in all, we must for the same Reason im∣plicitly
teach all their <HI>Doctrines,</HI> or else have a
Power of receding from them all.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99"/>
For if there be any Thing in the Nature of
<HI>Doctrines,</HI> in the <HI>Tenour</HI> of Scripture, or the <HI>Sense</HI>
of Antiquity, whereby we can know the diffe∣rence
of some <HI>Doctrines</HI> from others, that some
were <HI>Occasional Temporary</HI> Determinations, suited
to particular States and Conditions in the Church,
whilst others were such general <HI>Doctrines</HI> as
would concern the Church in all States and Cir∣cumstances;
If there can be this difference be∣twixt
Apostolical <HI>Doctrines,</HI> there must necessarily
be the same difference betwixt Apostolical <HI>Pra∣ctices,</HI>
unless we will say, that their <HI>Practices</HI> were
not suited to their <HI>Doctrines.</HI> For Occasional <HI>Do∣ctrines</HI>
must produce Occasional <HI>Practices.</HI></P>
<P>Now may not we be oblig'd by some <HI>Practices</HI>
of the Apostles, where the Nature of the Thing,
and the Consent of Antiquity shew it to be equal∣ly
necessary and important in all Ages and Condi∣tions
of the Church, without being ty'd down
to the strict observance of every Thing which
the Apostles did, tho' it plainly appears, that it
was done upon <HI>accidental</HI> and <HI>mutable</HI> Reasons.
Can we not be oblig'd to observe the <HI>Lord's Day</HI>
from Apostolical <HI>Practice,</HI> without being equally
oblig'd to <HI>Lock the Doors</HI> where we are met, be∣cause
in the Apostles Times they lock'd them for
fear of their Enemies.</P>
<P>My Lord, we are to follow the <HI>Practices</HI> of
the Apostles, as we ought to follow every Thing
else, with <HI>Discretion</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> and not run
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
headlong into every Thing they did, because
they were Apostles, or yet think that because
we need not practise after them in every Thing,
we need do it in nothing. We best imitate
them, when we act upon such Reasons as they
acted upon, and neither make their <HI>Occasional</HI>
Practices <HI>perpetual</HI> Laws, nor break thro' such
General Rules, as will always have the <HI>same rea∣son</HI>
to be observ'd.</P>
<P>If it be ask'd, how we can know what Pra∣ctices
must be observ'd, and what may be laid
aside? I answer, as we know <HI>Articles</HI> of Faith
from <HI>lesser Truths;</HI> as we know <HI>Occasional</HI> Do∣ctrines
from Perpetual Doctrines, that is, from
the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Things, from the <HI>Tenour</HI> of
Scripture, and the <HI>Testimony of</HI> Antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is not true, that the <HI>Divine unal∣terable
Right</HI> of Episcopacy is founded <HI>merely</HI> up∣on
Apostolical Practice.</P>
<P>We do not say that Episcopacy cannot be
changed, <HI>merely</HI> because we have Apostolical
Practice for it; but because such is the Nature of
the Christian Priesthood, that it can only be
continued in that Method, which God has ap∣pointed
for its Continuance. Thus, Episcopa∣cy
is the <HI>only</HI> instituted Method of continuing
the Priesthood; therefore Episcopacy is <HI>unchange∣able,</HI>
not because it is an Apostolical Practice,
but because the Nature of the Thing requires
it: A positive Institution being only to be con∣tinued
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
in that Method which God has appointed;
so that it is the Nature of the Priesthood, and
not the Apostolical Practice alone, that makes
it necessary to be continued. The Apostolical
Practice indeed shews, that Episcopacy is the
Order that is appointed, but it is the Nature of
the Priesthood that assures us that it is <HI>Unaltera∣ble:</HI>
And- that because an Office which is of no
significancy, but as it is of Divine Appoint∣ment,
and instituted by God, can no otherways
be continued, but in that way of Continuance
which God has appointed.</P>
<P>The Argument proceeds thus; The Christian
Priesthood is a Divine positive Institution, which
as it could only begin by the <HI>Divine Appointment,</HI>
so it can only descend to after Ages in such a
Method, as God has been-pleased to appoint.</P>
<P>The Apostles (and your Lordship owns,
Christ was in <HI>all</HI> that they did)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Answer to Dr. <HI>Snape.</HI></NOTE> instituted Episco∣pacy
<HI>alone,</HI> therefore this Method of Episcopa∣cy
is unalterable, not because an <HI>Apostolical Practice</HI>
cannot be laid aside, but because the Priesthood
can only descend to after-Ages in such a Me∣thod
as is of Divine Appointment.</P>
<P>So that the Question is not fairly stated, when
it is asked, whether Episcopacy, being an Aposto∣lical
Practice, may be laid aside? But it should
be asked, whether an instituted particular Me∣thod
of continuing the Priesthood be not neces∣sary
to be continued? Whether an appointed
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
Order of receiving a Commission from God be
not necessary to be observ'd, in order to receive
a Commission from Him? If the Case was thus
stated, as it ought to be fairly stated, any one
would soon perceive, that we can no more lay
aside Episcopacy, and yet continue the Christian
Priesthood, than we can alter the Terms of Sal∣vation,
and yet be in Covenant with God.</P>
<P><HI>I come now, my Lord, to the Second Ob∣jection,</HI>
That this uninterrupted Succession is subject
to so great uncertainty, that if it be necessary, we can
never say that we are in the Church.</P>
<P>I know no Reason, my Lord, why it is so
uncertain, but because it is founded upon
<HI>Historical Evidence.</HI> Let it therefore be consider∣ed,
my Lord, that Christianity it self, is a <HI>Mat∣ter
of Fact,</HI> only convey'd to us by <HI>Historical Evi∣dence.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Canon of Scripture</HI> is only made known
to us by <HI>Historical Evidence;</HI> that we have no
other way of knowing what Writings are the
word of God; and yet the Truth of our Faith, and
every other Means of Grace depends upon our
Knowledge and Belief of the Scriptures. Must
we not declare the Necessity of this Succession
of Bishops, because it can only be prov'd by
<HI>Historical Evidence,</HI> and that for such a long tract
of Time?</P>
<P>Why then do we declare the belief of the
Scriptures, necessary to Salvation? Is not this
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
equally putting the Salvation of Men upon a
<HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> supported only by <HI>Historical Evi∣dence,</HI>
and making it depend upon Things done
seventeen hundred Years ago? Cannot <HI>Historical
Evidence</HI> satisfie us in one Point, as well as in
the other? Is there any Thing in the Nature of
this Succession, that it can't be as well asserted
by <HI>Historical Evidence,</HI> as the Truth of the Scrip∣tures?
Is there not the same bare possibility in the
Thing it self, that the Scriptures may in some
important Points be corrupted, as that this Suc∣cession
may be broke? But is this any just Rea∣son
why we should believe, or fear, that the Scri∣ptures
are corrupted, because there is a Phy∣sical
Possibility of it, tho' there is all the Proof
that can be requir'd of the contrary? Why then
must we set aside the Necessity of this Successi∣on
from a <HI>bare possibility of</HI> Error, tho' there is all
the Proof that can be requir'd, that it never was
broken, but strictly kept up?</P>
<P>And tho' your Lordship has told the World
so much of the <HI>Improbability, Nonsense,</HI> and <HI>Ab∣surdity</HI>
of this Succession, yet I prormise your
Lordship an Answer when ever you shall think
fit to shew, <HI>when;</HI> or <HI>how,</HI> or <HI>where</HI> this Suc∣cession
broke, or <HI>seem'd</HI> to break, or was <HI>likely</HI>
to break.</P>
<P>And till then, I shall content my self with
offering this Reason to your Lordship, why it is
<HI>morally impossible,</HI> it ever should have broken in
all that Term of Years, from the Apostles to the
present Times.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104"/>
The Reason is this; it has been a receiv'd Do∣ctrine
in every Age of the Church, that no Or∣dination
was valid but that of Bishops: This Do∣ctrine,
my Lord, has been a constant Guard
upon the <HI>Episcopal Succession;</HI> for seeing it was uni∣versally
believ'd that Bishops <HI>alone</HI> could Ordain,
it was <HI>morally impossible,</HI> that any Persons could
be receiv'd as Bishops, who had not been so
Ordain'd.</P>
<P>Now is it not <HI>morally impossible,</HI> that in our
Church any one should be made a Bishop with∣out
<HI>Episcopal Ordination?</HI> Is there any possibility
of forging Orders, or satealing a Bishoprick by
any other Stratagem? No, it is <HI>morally impossible,</HI>
because it is an acknowledg'd Doctrine amongst
us, that a Bishop can only be ordain'd by Bi∣shops?
Now as this Doctrine must necessarily
prevent any one being a Bishop without <HI>Episcopal
Ordination</HI> in our Age, so it must have the same
effect in every other Age as well as ours; and
consequently it is as reasonable to believe that
the Succession of Bishiops was not broke in any
Age since the Apostles, as that it was not broke
in our own Kingdom within these forty Years.
For the same Doctrine which preserves it forty
Years, may as well preserve it forty hundred
Years, if it was equally believ'd in all that
space of Time. That this has been the constant
Doctrine of the Church, I presume your Lord∣ship
will not deny; I have not here enter'd into
the Historical Defence of it, this, and indeed
every other Institution of the Christian Church
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving been lately so well defended from the
Ecclesiastical Records by a very excellent and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dicious Writer.</P>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Original Draught of the Primitive Church.</NOTE>
<P>We believe the Scriptures are not corrupted,
because it was always a received Doctrine in the
Church that, they were the <HI>standing Rule of Faith,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd because the Providence of God may well be
suppos'd to preserve such Books, as were to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ey
to every Age the Means of Salvation. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Reasons prove the great improbability that

<P>Is this Succession then such an <HI>improbable, im∣possible</HI>

in the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI> What Arguments, or
Authority can your Lordship produce to shew
that there is a Succession there, that will not
equally prove it to be here?</P>
<P>You assert expresly, that there is a <HI>true Succession</HI>
there; you deny that we have it here; therefore
your Lordship must mean, that we had not Epis∣copal

must rest betwixt you and your Adversaries, <HI>whe∣ther
we had Episcopal Ordination then;</HI> for as your

it is impossible that we should want it, unless

<HI>morally</HI> speaking, <HI>impossible,</HI> and, for this Reason,
they need not trouble their Heads about it; yet
in another Place you positively affirm, that this

an <HI>uninterrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Succession,</HI> when they see you so
kindly except theirs? And think it only <HI>Nonsense</HI>
and <HI>Absurdity,</HI> when claim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by any other Church?
Surely, my Lord, they must conceive great
Hopes of your Lordship, since you have here ra∣ther
ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to contradict your self, than not vouch
for their Succession: For you have said it is mo∣rally
impossible, yet affirm that it is with them.</P>
<P>The third Objection against this <HI>uninterrupted
Succession,</HI> is this, that it is a <HI>Popish Doctrine,</HI> and
<HI>gives Papists advantage over us.</HI></P>
<P>The Objection proceeds thus, we must not
assert the Necessity of this Succession, because
the Papists say it is only to be found with them.
I might add, because some mighty zealous Pro∣testants
say so too.</P>
<P>But if this be good Argumentation, we ought
not co tell the <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Deists,</HI> &amp;c. that there is any
Necessity of embracing Christianity, because the
<HI>Papists</HI> say Christians can only be saved in their
Church.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108"/>
Again we ought not to insist upon a true Fait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
because the <HI>Papists</HI> say, that a true Faith is on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in their Communion. So that there is just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
much Popery in teaching this Doctrine, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
asserting the Necessity of Christianity to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
or the Necessity of a right Faith to a <HI>Socinian,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I shall only trouble your Lordship with a Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
or two concerning another Point in my forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Letter. I there prov'd that your Lordship ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
put the whole of our Title to God's Favou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon Sincerity, <HI>as such,</HI> Independent of ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Thing else. That no Purity of Worship, no ex∣cellence
of Order, no Truth of Faith, no Sort o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Sacraments, no Kind of Institutions, or any
Church, <HI>as such</HI> can help us to the least Degree of
God's Favour, or give us the smallest Advantage
above any other Communion. And consequent∣ly
that your Lordship has set sincere <HI>Jews, Qua∣kers,
Socinians, Muggletonians,</HI> and all <HI>Hereticks</HI> and
<HI>Schismaticks</HI> upon the same Bottom, as to the Fa∣vour
of God, with sincere Christians.</P>
<P>Upon this, my Lord, I am called upon to
prove that these several Sorts of People can be
<HI>Sincere</HI> in your account of Sincerity. To which,
my Lord, I make this Answer, either there are
some sincere Persons amongst <HI>Jews, Quakers,
Socinians,</HI> or any kind of <HI>Hereticks</HI> and <HI>Schismaticks,</HI>
or there are not; if there are, your Lordship has
given them the same title to God's Favour, that
you have to the sincerest Christians, if you will say,
there are no sincere Persons amongst any of them,
then your Lordship Damns them all in the Gross,
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
for surely Corruptions in Religion, profess'd
with unsincerity, will never save People.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do to prove the Sincerity
of any of them, if they are Sincere, what I
have said is true, if you will not allow them to
be Sincere, you condemn them all at once.</P>
<P>Again, I humbly suppos'd a Man might be
sincere in his <HI>Religious Opinions,</HI> tho' it might be
owing to <HI>some ill Habits,</HI> or <HI>something Criminal</HI> in
Himself, that he was fallen into such or such
a way of Thinking. Bus it seems this is all <HI>Con∣tradiction;</HI>
and no Man can be sincere, who has
<HI>any Faults,</HI> or whose <HI>Faults</HI> have any <HI>Influence</HI> upon
his way of Thinking.</P>
<P>Your Lordship tells all the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> that
they may be easie, if they are sincere; and that it
is the only Ground for Peace and Satisfaction.
But pray, my Lord, if none are to be esteemed
<HI>sincere,</HI> but those who have no Faults, or whose
Faults have no Influence upon their Perswasions,
who can be assur'd that he is <HI>sincere,</HI> but he that
has the least Pretence to it, the <HI>Proud Pharisee?</HI>
If your Lordship or your Advocates were desir'd
to prove your Sincerity, either before God or
Man, it must be for these Reasons, because you
have no ill Passions or Habits, no faulty Prejudi∣ces,
no past or present Vices that can have any
Effect upon your Minds. My Lord, as this is
the only Proof that any of you could give of
your own Sincerity in this Meaning of it, so the
very Pretence to it would prove the Wane of it.</P>
