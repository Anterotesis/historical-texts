<HEAD>TO THE
Most Noble and Mighty PRINCE,
WILLIAM
Duke of DEVONSHIRE,
Lord STEWARD of Her Majesty's Houshold,
AND
Knight of the most Noble Order of the
GARTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF the following POEM had been written by a
Person who had a Genius equal to the Subject, it
would in a peculiar manner have belong'd to Your
Grace: For to whom should a Poet sooner ad∣dress
the Praises of a King, who will be eternally Glo∣rious
for the Restoring and Maintaining our Liberties,
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
and the common Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> than to Your
Grace, who has always appear'd so Great a Defender of
them, and has ventur'd, and done, and suffer'd for them
more than any Subject in <HI>England?</HI> The ardent Love of
Liberty and of Your Country, are some of the many
Heroick Qualities which You have inherited from Your
Noble Ancestors, and some of the many which Your
Grace has the Happiness to see deriv'd from Your
Noble Self by the other Hope of Your August Family.
The Wisdom, Foresight, Resolution, and Greatness of
Soul that the Brave Lord <HI>Candish</HI> so constantly shew'd in
the last Parliaments of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, will never
be forgotten as long as an <HI>Englishman</HI> remains alive.
Ev'n then when it was esteem'd by some an unpardon∣able
Crime to be thought one, even then Your Grace
and that Illustrious Friend, whose Memory shall always
be Dear to all the faithful Lovers of their Country, both
of You heroically dar'd to appear at the Head of <HI>English∣men</HI>
resolv'd to assert their Privileges. He gloriously
seal'd the Love of his Country with his Blood; but even
after the Loss of the best of Friends, Your Grace perse∣ver'd
with an undaunted Spirit in the Noble Cause of
Liberty. Nor could the just Grief which You paid
to his Memory, hinder You from paying that Duty
which You ow'd to Your Country, which has always
deservedly been Your first Affection. If some other
Persons at that time would have entred into the Wisdom
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
of both Your Counsels, You your selves had saved
us without the Help of the King; Your Noble Friend,
as Your Grace's Self, had been one of the living Orna∣ments
of Your delivered Country, and there had been
no need of the Revolution, nor perhaps of the long
War that succeeded it. It was neither His nor Your
Grace's Fault that You were not then sufficiently se∣conded,
and consequently that You did not save these
Nations all that Blood and Treasure which the War has
cost them. But when afterwards things were brought
to that Extremity that a Revolution was absolutely ne∣cessary,
no Man did more than Your Grace towards the
bringing it about, and working our Deliverance that
way. Your Grace was then the most Glorious In∣strument
of establishing the best of Kings upon the
Throne of <HI>England,</HI> and defending her present Majesty
at so dangerous a Juncture as that of the Revolution.
She wisely thought that She could have no where recourse
to a better Place for Her Safety, than where Your Grace
was known to direct by Your Counsels, and to animate
by Your Courage the Brave Assertors of Liberty.</P>
<P>I have a long time design'd to lay something of
mine at Your Grace's Feet, that it might live, and grow
and flourish under so Illustrious a Patronage. But the
Awe that I stood in of the Force of Your Judgment,
and the Fineness of Your Discernment, made me wait
for this Opportunity: For I know very well, that I ei∣ther
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
ought never to approach You this way at all
or to do it when I can be most secure of my self. And
tho what I offer You now is far from meriting so High a
Protection, yet I have less Mistrust of it than of any
thing I have done in Poetry. Besides, the Design and
the Immortal Subject may supply in some measure the
Weakness of my Performance: For I am confident
that Your Grace will not refuse to grant that Protection
to the Vindication of the King's Memory, which the
King at Your Grace's Request granted to the Rights and
Privileges of every <HI>Englishman.</HI> I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your Grace's most Humble;
most Dutiful, and
most Obedient Servant,

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem was writ without any manner
of Design of obliging or offending a Party. For in
all my Life-time I never designed either to please or of∣fend
any, and was always of Opinion that he who makes his Court
to any, is sure to do it to the wrong; for if all Men were for the
Publick Good, there never could be any Party, because a Patriot
designs the Good of his Country, but one of a Party intends his
own.</P>
<P>THE following Poem was writ with an Intention to do what
Service I could to my Country at this Conjuncture; which, as
Mr. <HI>Waller,</HI> has truly observed, is a Duty incumbent upon the
Muses Friend.</P>
<Q><PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
<L>THE Muses Friend unto himself severe,</L>
<L>With silent Pity looks on all that err.</L>
<L>But if a great, a publick Action shines,</L>
<L>That he rewards with his▪ Immortal Lines.</L>
<L>Whether it be in Council or in Fight,</L>
<L>His Countries Honour is his chief Delight:</L>
<L>Praise of great Acts he scatters as a Seed,</L>
<L>Which may the like in coming Ages breed.</L></Q>
<P>THIS is certain, that the late King delivered us from a de¦plorable
State. Now we who were once in a condition to want
Deliverer, may hereafter be in such a Condition again; for who
has happened may happen. But since, as Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> observes
most Heroes are incited to the noble Acts they perform by a De¦sire
of Praise, who will be at the Trouble to save or defend
People so ingrateful as to refuse them that?</P>
<P>I DESIRE that the Reader would take two Cautions along
with him: The one that he would not interpret that Love of Libe¦ty
which will be found in the following Poem, for an Aversion
Monarchy; for Liberty is as consistent with the Government
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
of One as with that of a Thousand. The other is, that he
would by no means mistake the Reflexions upon the Army which
he <HI>Dutch</HI> had in 1672. for a Satyr upon the Nation in ge∣neral.
For I have a long time known the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be a Va∣iant,
a Wise and a Great People, and their Country to be one
of the strongest Bulwarks of the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>IF any one happens to wonder that I have employed so many
Verses in describing the Battel of <HI>Seneffe,</HI> without dwelling
afterwards upon any other of the Glorious Actions of the King,
as the Battel of <HI>Mons,</HI> or that of the <HI>Boyn,</HI> or the Siege of
<HI>Namur:</HI> I desire him to consider that in Descriptions of all
Fights, there is something resembling; and by consequence, that
one such Description for so short a work is enough; and that
from among all the Actions of the King I chose the Battel of
<HI>Seneffe,</HI> because of the Brave Army opposed to Him, and
the Great Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> who headed them; and because
it is the greatest of all the Actions in which the King, or per∣haps
any other Captain ever has been engaged; and above all▪
because the Success of the Allies was undeniably due to the King's
Valour and Conduct.</P>
<P>THE following Poem was writ with a Design of showing the
King and not my self, and written in the Language not of the
Head but the Heart. 'Tis written in Blank Verse, and not
in Ryme, not only because I thought that the former would
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
give me the more Liberty, but for several other Reasons which
will offer themselves immediately to all who are Judges of Poetry,
and which signify nothing to the rest. I will only put the
Reader in mind that Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> looked upon Ryme as a Bon∣dage,
and my Lord <HI>Roscommon</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> as a
Barbarity. Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> tells us in his Preface to <HI>Paradise
lost,</HI> that Ryme is trivial to Judicious Ears, and of no true
Musical Delight; and Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> in his Verses before the
Essay upon translated Verse, that Poetry flourished in <HI>Greece</HI>
and <HI>Rome,</HI>
<Q><L>Till barbarous Nations and more barbarous Times,</L>
<L>Debas'd the Majesty of Verse to Rymes.</L></Q>
Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> threw it off in Dramatick Poetry, as Mr. <HI>Mil∣ton</HI>
had done in Heroick, and as my Lord <HI>Roscommon</HI> would
have done, if he had lived to write any more; of which the
following Lines in the Essay upon translated Verse, may be suffici∣ent
to satisfy us.</P>
<LG>
<L>OF many Faults Ryme is perhaps the Cause,</L>
<L>Too true to Ryme we slight more useful Laws;</L>
<L>For that in <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome</HI> was never known,</L>
<L>Till by <HI>Barbarian</HI> Deluges o'erflown,</L>
<L><PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
Subdu'd, undone, they did at last obey,</L>
<L>And change their own for their Invaders Way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I GRANT that from some Mossy Idol Oak,</L>
<L>In double Rymes our <HI>Thor</HI> and <HI>Woden</HI> spoke;</L>
<L>And by Succession of unlearned Times,</L>
<L>As Bards began, so Monks rung on the Chimes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT now that <HI>Phoebus</HI> and the Sacred Nine,</L>
<L>With all their Beams on our blest Island shine;</L>
<L>Why should not we their antient Rites restore,</L>
<L>And be what <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens</HI> were before?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O MAY I live to Hail the Glorious Day,</L>
<L>And sing loud <HI>Peans</HI> thro the crouded Way,</L>
<L>When in Triumphant State the <HI>British</HI> Muse,</L>
<L>True to herself, shall barbarous Aid refuse,</L>
<L>And in the <HI>Roman</HI> Majesty appear,</L>
<L>Which none no better, and none come so near.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB REF="11"/>
FROM what has been said it is plain, that three of our Poets,
who have been deservedly celebrated for the Fineness of their
Ears, have condemned and exploded Ryme, not only as an Ene∣my
to Art, and a Clog to Genius, and a Debaser of the Majesty
of Verse; but as a thing of barbarous Sound, and contrary to
true Musical Delight. And I am confident, that those three
Gentlemen, if they had been alive, would have been pleased to
have seen in the following Poem, an attempt to second that ge∣nerous
Design, which the first of them began, and which the
two others approved of; a Design to shake off a barbarous Cus∣tom,
and to shew the Harmony of our Mother Tongue (con∣trary
to Vulgar received Opinion) above that of our Neigh∣bours
the <HI>French,</HI> which is utterly incapable of producing
any thing like Poetical Musick without the assistance of Ryme.</P>

OF
William the Third.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>VVHAT sudden Damp has seiz'd upon my Soul?</L>
<L>Why are my Spirits chill'd, my Nerves unbent?</L>
<L>Why am I sad, as is the mournful Grave?</L>
<L>As if I never should know Comfort more.</L>
<L>Sure conscious Nature gives Presage that Death.</L>
<L>The Tyrant whom she most abhors, draws near.</L>
<L>Ah woe! 'tis now too plain; for a worse Death</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="13"/>
Has happen'd than alas thou fondly thought'st,</L>
<L>A Death in which the ruin'd World's concern'd,</L>
<L>A Death attended with the Fate of Nations.</L>
<L>Too plain, alas, I hear the doleful Sound,</L>
<L>The Good, the Great, the Godlike <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s dead.</L>
<L>Gone is his mighty Mind, for ever flown,</L>
<L>And nought but his Immortal Name remains:</L>
<L>Gone is Great Providence's Watchful Viceroy,</L>
<L>Gone the Great Soul that watch'd the Christian World,</L>
<L>As the good faithful Shepherd does his Sheep</L>
<L>Against the Prowlings of the nightly Wolf.</L>
<L>Who shall now guard us from the bloody Foe?</L>
<L>Mourn then, my Soul, th' irreparable Loss,</L>
<L>And with thee summon Human Kind to mourn,</L>
<L>With them too summon even th' Immortal Powers.</L>
<L>Thou first and chief, forlorn <HI>Britannia,</HI> mourn,</L>
<L>And with thee let thy faithful Sons keep time;</L>
<L>For thou and they, and all have lost in him</L>
<L>A Champion, Benefactor, Father, Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THOU next, <HI>Batavia,</HI> faln <HI>Batavia,</HI> mourn,</L>
<L>O let thy Eyes dissolve into a Stream,</L>
<L>For thou hast lost—(O what hast thou not lost?)</L>
<L>Thy Bulwark, thy Defence, thy lofty Mound</L>
<L>That kept out lawless Arbitrary Pow'r,</L>
<L>Which, like the Ocean, now surrounds thy Tow'rs,</L>
<L>With dreadful Inundation threatn'ng all.</L>

<L><HI>EVROP A</HI> Beautiful, in sadness mourn!</L>
<L>Thy Father, thy Defender's from thee torn,</L>
<L>And now the Lustful Bestial God once more</L>

<L>With thee let all thy Royal Sons lament,</L>
<L>Those martial Sons that were with <HI>WILLIAM</HI> join'd</L>
<L>In the Great Cause of Godlike Liberty:</L>
<L>Who shall your several Interests now unite?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND thou, Celestial Charmer, LIBERTY,</L>
<L>Daughter of Wisdom, and of Supreme <HI>Jove!</HI></L>
<L>Sister of Reason, and of Sovereign Law;</L>
<L>Now Goddess beat thy beauteous Breasts, and rend</L>
<L>The flowing Ringlets of thy golden Hair,</L>
<L>To mourn thy Mighty Benefactor's Fate;</L>
<L>For <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s Fate, O Liberty, was thine:</L>
<L>Thou and Religion here have room no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND thou the darling Daughter of the Skies,</L>
<L>Divine RELIGION, thou whose melting Eyes</L>
<L>Have always like perpetual Fountains stream'd</L>
<L>To mourn th' Offences of a sinful World,</L>
<L>O let them pour a Deluge now of Tears</L>
<L>To wail the dismal Consequence of Sin,</L>
<L>To mourn Great <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s and thy Flight to Heav'n.</L>
<L>He was thy Lover, and thy best belov'd,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="15"/>
He was thy Champion, and thy sole Defence</L>
<L>Against the Tyrants both of Earth and Hell.</L>
<L>His flaming Zeal, O Goddess, rouz'd thy Friends,</L>
<L>His charming Accents gain'd thy very Foes</L>
<L>To fight, O Goddess, and to die for thee,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND ye, O ANGELS and ARCHANGELS all,</L>
<L>Guardians of mighty Kingdoms, and of Kings,</L>
<L>Who could your Cares on <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s Breast repose,</L>
<L>Who could your several Charges all to him</L>
<L>Resign, while happily aloft ye tower'd,</L>
<L>And cut with golden Wings your blissful Heav'n;</L>
<L>Now mourn his Flight to the pure Realms of Day,</L>
<L>And mourn your own Return to a bad World;</L>
<L>For he is to your upper Regions flown,</L>
<L>Who equal to your selves your Cares below supply'd.</L>

<L>His Godlike Soul's for ever from us flown,</L>
<L>Whose Zeal could the divided Earth unite,</L>
<L>Whose wond'rous Zeal united Earth and Heav'n,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT let there be such Lamentation here</L>
<L>As ne'er was known for any Fate before,</L>
<L>And let the Grief be general, as the Loss;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="16"/>
For Human Kind has lost by <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s Death,</L>
<L>His People most, his first and chiefest Care.</L>
<L>He was the tender Father to his People,</L>
<L>A Friend and Brother to the rest of Kings;</L>
<L>(Alas, few Kings are Friends, or meet with Friends)</L>
<L>A Benefactor to the Race of Men.</L>
<L>Sure 'twas some Angel who forsook the Skies,</L>
<L>And out of wondrous Love to wretched Men</L>
<L>Vouchsaf 'd to dwell in Human Shape below.</L>
<L>For all his Life-time, he from Place to Place</L>
<L>Remov'd, dispensing Benefits to all;</L>
<L>And from their Gates the grand Destroyer drove.</L>
<L>For that alone he mov'd, he spoke, he thought.</L>
<L>As if th' important Business of his Life</L>
<L>Had been to sacrifice his own Felicity</L>
<L>To that of wretched Men, his Great Design</L>
<L>Extended to his most inveterate Foes:</L>
<L>He blest ev'n them, and would have done them good,</L>
<L>Because his Foes were still his Fellow Creatures,</L>
<L>From one Divine Original deriv'd.</L>
<L>His Foes his Justice and his Mercy knew;</L>
<L>And his inviolable Faith as firm</L>
<L>As are th' unchangeable Decrees of Fate.</L>
<L>For tho the wondrous Goodness of his Soul</L>
<L>Made him still sympathize in all our Joys,</L>
<L>And mourn and suffer in the Woes we feel;</L>
<L>Tho. He found something in his godlike Mind,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="17"/>
That answer'd to the Cries of the Distress'd,</L>
<L>And gave him Anguish, till they found Relief,</L>
<L>Which was the Source of all his wondrous Deeds,</L>
<L>And which distinguish'd his Heroick Life,</L>
<L>And set him far above all vulgar Heroes;</L>
<L>Yet was his Word so sacred and so sure,</L>
<L>He would not break it to preserve a World.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT when your vulgar Heroes we survey,</L>
<L>We find them the abhor'd Reverse of this.</L>
<L>They, by the Fever of Ambition fir'd,</L>
<L>Run frantickly about the frighted World,</L>
<L>And think to grow by mighty Mischiefs great,</L>
<L>While Horror marches in their dreadful Van,</L>
<L>And Death and Slaughter in their bloody Rear.</L>
<L>Whole Towns they plunder, lay whole Countries waste,</L>
<L>With grinding Want they make vast Kingdoms pine,</L>
<L>But their own Kingdoms into Deserts turn,</L>
<L>Where Famine lords it in its wild Domain:</L>
<L>For their own Kingdoms loudest cry to Heav'n,</L>
<L>And loudest under their Oppression groan.</L>
<L>If they make doubtful Peace or hollow Truce,</L>
<L>'Tis but for time to wage more dangerous War,</L>
<L>To weaken and divide their thoughtless Foes,</L>
<L>And lull them by Security to Fate.</L>
<L>To Friends deceitful, faithless to Allies,</L>
<L>Perfidious, perjur'd to their in-born Slaves;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="18"/>
Revengeful, cruel, bloody to Mankind:</L>
<L>A Sea of guiltless Blood they spill, a Sea</L>
<L>Of helpless Widows and of Orphans Tears,</L>
<L>Destroy their Enemies, their Subjects more:</L>
<L>Their Subjects chiefly feel their barbarous Hands;</L>
<L>For mad with Rage, their Enemies they tear,</L>
<L>But their poor Subjects coolly they destroy.</L>
<L>O fruitless Labour of fantastick Pride!</L>
<L>For while they thus would more than Men appear,</L>
<L>Their Breach of Faith, the Wrongs they do each Hour,</L>
<L>Their hateful Violences make them less;</L>
<L>Only by Fools and Impious Men admir'd,</L>
<L>Abhor'd by God, by all good Men despis'd.</L>
<L>Too faithful Copies of their proud Original,</L>
<L>The great Destroyer, and the Foe of Men,</L>
<L>The first and grand Artificer of Fraud;</L>
<L>The pow'rful Prince of all th' infernal Pow'rs;</L>
<L>Mighty to act, sagacious to contrive,</L>
<L>Who with capacious comprehensive thought</L>
<L>Sits brooding o'er his dark and damn'd Design</L>
<L>Of captivating all the Race of Men,</L>
<L>And fixing Universal Monarchy,</L>
<L>Which he sometimes with Violence and Rage,</L>
<L>Sometimes with Lies and Hell-born Arts pursues:</L>
<L>His Foes sometimes with open Force invades,</L>
<L>But most with secret Practice undermines,</L>
<L>And sows Dissensions to divide their Strength.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="19"/>
A dreadful and a dangerous Foe to all;</L>
<L>But sure Perdition to his fastest Friends:</L>
<L>And his Allies are lost, as are his Slaves;</L>
<L>Who in Infernal Pains for ever howl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS earthly Heroes copy him of Hell,</L>
<L>Those Tyrants whom the thoughtless World calls Heroes:</L>
<L>Such was not happy <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> but a Friend</L>
<L>To Men, and Servant of the most Supreme.</L>
<L>The chief and godlike Purpose of his Soul,</L>
<L>Was the restoring Quiet, Order, Peace,</L>
<L>And Universal Happiness to Men;</L>
<L>And like a faithful Servant to advance</L>
<L>His Master's universal great Design.</L>
<L>His Master would have all his Creatures blest,</L>
<L>He loves the miserable Sons of Men;</L>
<L>And with a Love so ardent and so high,</L>
<L>As never can be thought be finite Man.</L>
<L>Next his was <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s Love to all his Kind,</L>
<L>For Fiends and Tyrants only were his Foes;</L>
<L>And Tyrants he esteem'd no longer Men,</L>
<L>As cursed Fiends are Angels now no more,</L>
<L>Fal'n from their Natures and their Names by Pride.</L>
<L>He hated both, to both a mortal Foe,</L>
<L>Because they dar'd t' impeach his godlike Purpose.</L>
<L>For they make wretched all whom they make Slaves;</L>
<L>For what can be so dismal as to see▪</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="20"/>
Our Lives, our Fortunes, nay our ev'ry Action,</L>
<L>Nay ev'n our Virtue and Divine Religion,</L>
<L>All in a feverish frantick Tyrant's pow'r,</L>
<L>And to his boundless Passions all expos'd.</L>
<L>He look'd with Indignation and Disdain</L>
<L>Upon th' aspiring, vain, presumptuous Wretch,</L>
<L>Who thought it great t'enslave his Fellow-Creatures:</L>
<L>Dogs were not made to be control'd by Dogs.</L>
<L>Nor Horses over Horses to insult,</L>
<L>They rule not one another; nor ought Man</L>
<L>To controul Man; but God is to command,</L>
<L>Who governs still by Reason and by Law.</L>
<L>He loves the Sons of Men, and leaves them free,</L>
<L>As free as is his own Almighty Power.</L>
<L>For he himself makes Reason still his Guide,</L>
<L>And swerves not from his own Eternal Laws.</L>
<L>Since our Great Maker then has left us free,</L>
<L>On whom we so immediately depend,</L>
<L>In whom we live, and move, and ev'n exist,</L>
<L>Kings who are God's Vice-gerents too must leave</L>
<L>Those who are under their Subjection, free;</L>
<L>And govern them by Reason and by Law.</L>
<L>For tho like Gods they'r honour'd, they are Men,</L>
<L>And they must die like Men: So <HI>WILLIAM</HI> rul'd,</L>
<L>And look'd with Anger and with just Disdain</L>
<L>Upon the vain, the mortal, dying Wretch,</L>
<L>Who dares to make them Slaves whom God makes free;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="21"/>
Who by his lawless boundless Passions sways,</L>
<L>And sacrifices to his Lust of Power</L>
<L>A thousand greater worthier than Himself.</L>
<L>(For such are all the Good and truly Wise)</L>
<L>Which is renouncing Reason's sacred Rule,</L>
<L>Subverting th' Awful Government of God,</L>
<L>Deposing ev'n the World's Perpetual King,</L>
<L>As far as lies within a Mortal's Power,</L>
<L>T' assert the direful Government of Hell.</L>
<L>For if good Kings are God's Vicegerents, sure.</L>
<L>A Tyrant is Hell's Viceroy, and as such</L>
<L>A Christian's bound by his Baptismal Vow</L>
<L>Against him to denounce perpetual War.</L>
<L>So <HI>WILLIAM</HI> did, and seem'd design'd by Fate</L>

<L>He dy'd performing his Great Master's Will;</L>
<L>And as He knew no Fear, so Pain it self</L>
<L>Could not divert him from his Great Design.</L>
<L>If we give Credit to the Sons of Art,</L>
<L>His latest Hours in sharpest Pains were spent,</L>
<L>And yet he shew'd no smallest Sign of Pain,</L>
<L>Utter'd no loud Complaint, nor piercing Groan;</L>
<L>No Mark of Torment on his Face appear'd,</L>
<L>Only a more compassionating Look</L>
<L>For his lov'd People whom he left behind,</L>
<L>The best of Fathers for his Children felt,</L>
<L>But for himself appear'd insensible.</L>
<L>Yet his no fruitless vain Compassion was,</L>
<L>But made him eager to compleat those Acts</L>
<L>That dire impending Mischiefs might prevent,</L>
<L>And might our future Happiness secure.</L>

<L>O GREATNESS, never known to Man before!</L>
<L>Too great to be conceiv'd by Human Thought!</L>
<L>Behold a Man, who dies in sharpest Pain,</L>
<L>In his own Height of Misery intent</L>
<L>Upon providing Happiness for all,</L>
<L>Which makes the sole Imployment of a God,</L>
<L>In perfect Ease and full Felicity:</L>
<L>As much concern'd for the World's Liberty,</L>
<L>As if his Business ceas'd not with his Life,</L>
<L>As if our Guardian Angel had assum'd</L>
<L>That Royal Shape, and would not leave his Charge,</L>
<L>But only disappear to Mortal Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOT the least Trouble or Concern He shew'd,</L>
<L>That his Great Maker call'd him at a Time,</L>
<L>When the expecting World had all its Eyes</L>
<L>Intent on Him, the Darling Theme of Fame;</L>
<L>When all his vast Designs were just reduc'd</L>
<L>Within a certain Prospect of Success;</L>
<L>When humbled <HI>Gaul,</HI> and the deliver'd World</L>
<L>Had all advanc'd his Fame to such a height,</L>
<L>As never Human Glory rose before.</L>
<L>Not in the least concern'd at being snatch'd</L>
<L>From the transporting Joy, the vast Applause▪</L>
<L>Of all the Nations happy made by Him.</L>
<L>The Hero meekly bore it, tho He knew</L>
<L>That the World judges by the last Event;</L>
<L>But the World's Praise was what he could contemn.</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="58"/>
He like a faithful Servant had perform'd</L>
<L>What his Great Master destin'd him to do;</L>
<L>And so dy'd, pleas'd with this Heroick Thought,</L>
<L>That had that Master's absolute Decree</L>
<L>Allotted him a thousand times as much,</L>
<L>He would with Cheerfulness have done it all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OF all about him in that dreadful Hour</L>
<L>He was alone serene, the mournful rest</L>
<L>Felt all the fiercest Pangs of Grief and Fear,</L>
<L>Of ghastful Horror, and of wild Despair;</L>
<L>Their bloodshot Eyes, and their distracted Looks</L>
<L>Declar'd the inward Torments of their Souls;</L>
<L>They all like Wretches on the Rack appear'd,</L>
<L>Like the compassionate Spectator He.</L>
<L>At last one hearty Sigh he gives for all,</L>
<L>A Sigh that ended his Heroick Toils,</L>
<L>And brought that Rest which Virtue could not bring.</L>
<L>And now in loud and lamentable Wails</L>
<L>They vent their lawless Grief that knows no Bounds:</L>
<L>Some for their Royal Patron wring their Hands,</L>
<L>Their Benefactor some aloud deplore;</L>
<L>Some their Wise, Brave, Undaunted General;</L>
<L>Their Great Deliverer and Defender some;</L>
<L>Their Father, like poor helpless Orphans, all.</L>
<L>But turn thy View, my Soul, from that vast Grief,</L>
<L>Whose mortal Prospect is enough to blast</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="59"/>
Thy strongest and thy noblest Faculties.</L>
<L>Yet whither must I fly t' avoid that Grief?</L>
<L>All <HI>Europe</HI> catches the contagious Woe:</L>
<L>The Greatest Men on Earth his Fate deplore,</L>
<L>Those dauntless Souls who always scorn'd their own</L>
<L>Kings for that Loss not only grieve, but die.</L>
<L>But cease your Lamentations, O ye Kings;</L>
<L>Your loud Laments, y' afflicted Nations cease;</L>
<L>'Tis for your selves this vast Excess of Woe,</L>
<L>And not for Him, for He is surely blest.</L>
<L>Never a greater Subject was of Woe;</L>
<L>But still excessive Grief some Weakness shews,</L>
<L>But lofty Praise declares a Noble Mind,</L>
<L>The best Return for mighty Benefits,</L>
<L>And worthy to be offer'd up to Gods,</L>
<L>And to good Kings, who most resemble Gods.</L>
<L>Then change your Voices all with one accord,</L>
<L>Y' afflicted Nations, change your mournful Notes,</L>
<L>And praise your mighty Benefactor's Name;</L>
<L>Lift up your Voices all with one accord,</L>
<L>For the Great Theme requires your noblest Flights.</L>
<L><HI>WILLIAM</HI> the Great, the Good, the Just is gone;</L>
<L>Yet never, never shall He die entire,</L>
<L>But his Immortal Memory shall last</L>
<L>As long as Gratitude remains in Men,</L>
<L>As long as lovely Liberty remains.</L>
<L>For <HI>WILLIAM</HI> was the Greatest, Best of Kings,</L>

That e'er was sent from Heaven to rule the Earth,</L>
<L>Or will be sent when Golden Times return:</L>
<L>Who, persecuted and opprest by Fate,</L>
<L>Outpower'd, outnumber'd by the common Foe,</L>
<L>Deserted by some Friends, betray'd by some,</L>

<L>Than if the noblest Conquest he had gain'd:</L>
<L>And who, to sum all Praises up in one,</L>
<L>Maintains ev'n dead the Freedom of the World,</L>
<L>Both by his Conduct, which Confederate Powers,</L>
<L>By Him combin'd in mutual League, persue;</L>
<L>And by the Wisdom of that Mighty Queen,</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="61"/>
Who now adds Lustre to th' Imperial Crown:</L>
<L>Her Wisdom and her Virtues are the Gifts,</L>
<L>Which He upon these Happy Realms bestow'd.</L>
<L>Had it not been for his Heroick Toils,</L>
<L>The Golden Scepter She so mildly sways,</L>
<L>Had been in bloody Hands an Iron Rod.</L>
<L>And can we owe this Happiness to Him,</L>
<L>And yet refuse our Benefactor's Praise?</L>
<L>Where is our Honour? Where our Gratitude?</L>
<L>And where our boasted Loyalty to Her?</L>
<L>Can we be Foes to his Immortal Name,</L>
<L>Who gave us Her, who all his wondrous Steps</L>
<L>Persues, and seconds all his vast Designs?</L>
<L>And may she second all, till she attains</L>
<L>The Happy Glorious End which He propos'd.</L>
