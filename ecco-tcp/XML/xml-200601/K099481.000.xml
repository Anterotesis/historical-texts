<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>SO various and complicated are the
scenes of this life, that seven years
have elapsed since the following pages
were written, a period, perhaps, more
favourable for publishing than the
present; but timidity, or other hinder∣ances
have repeatedly prevented their
appearing before the public; during
which time the author hoped some more
able advocate would have taken up the
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
cause, to do justice to a subject of such
importance to society at large, and par∣ticularly
a much injured part thereof.
For, alas! it is too well known, that
female education, in general, is con∣fined
within very narrow limits, and
seldom permitted to extend to classical
accomplishments. The writer of this
volume being a female, with only a
female's education, is sufficiently aware
of her inadequacy to the undertaking,
but trusts the importance of the subject
will claim some attention ; at the same
time, reposing a full confidence in the
candour and unbounded goodness of
some part of her readers at least, she
is once more encouraged to resume the
pen, to add, or amend such remarks as
the nature of the times and circum∣stanccs
require, and, at length, has so far
surmounted her timidity, as to submit
the following sheets, with all their im∣perfections,
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
perfections, to the inspection of a ge∣nerous
public, who are more ready to
appreciate the works of individuals
from the rectitude of intention, than
the beauty of composition. The at∣tempt,
she must acknowledge, has cost
her many a painful emotion ; for a first
attempt, surrounded by all the disad∣vantages
peculiar to the sex, seems, to
her, to require no small share of cou∣rage,
and which, indeed, nothing but
the importance of the subject should
have induced her to encounter.</P>
<P>The subject of the following pages
is an attempt to delineate the situa∣tion
of those poor, helpless, females
whose sufferings, from a variety of
causes, are too grievous to be borne;
the sources and dire consequences of
which the exalted in life cannot form
the least conception, unless they con∣descend
to examine for themselves,
when, it is to be hoped, their griev∣ances
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
will be sought into and redressed.
The munificence of the people of Great
Britain, which is ever ready and adequate
to the support, aid, and comfort, of the
afflicted, when their troubles are fully in∣vestigated;
and the great number of un∣fortunate
women, who, doubtless, would
rejoice to become virtuous and useful
members of society, in some lawful em∣ployment,
have encouraged the author
to offer this feeble representation. Nor
can she despair of eventual success to
the cause she has engaged in, if she is
but so happy as to excite the attention
of those whose souls are enlarged with
the exalted ideas of Christian charity.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is a work which, as a duty
to our fellow creatures, she has long,
very long, wished to see executed by a
more able pen; but the silence of others,
the liberality of a generous public, and
a most ardent wish to see miscry allevi∣ated,
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
and virtuous industry crowned
with abundant success, have been the
principal motives to her engaging in so
arduous an undertaking. Conscious,
however, that whatever good may be
the result, the praise alone is due to
the benevolent principles of humanity.</P>
<P>The author, at the same time, wishes
it to be understood, that she has not
been stimulated, from vain and ambi∣tious
views, to appear in print, but ra∣ther
from the pure philanthropic mo∣tive
of throwing in her humble mite
towards the much-wished-for relief of
these most pitiable objects of distress;
numbers of whom, from the want of a
fair representation of their case, she
greatly fears, are unable to obtain shel∣ter
under the auspicious shade of Chris∣tian
charity; and, consequently, are
compelled to share the fate of the
most wretched of human beings. She
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
wishes to represent the case of those
who would be industrious, if they might,
but are held down by the most power∣ful
influence of custom and misrepre∣sentation;
and, consequently, are in∣capable,
without the kind assistance of
humanity, to find redress, or even again
to tread the paths of virtue. But, alas!
finding herself so feeble an advocate, she
can only hold the pen of Truth, whilst
Reason and Justice plead their cause.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>" Say, sirst of God above, or man below,</L>
<L>" What can we reason from, but what we know?"</L></Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LET not the fair fame of this country be
tarnished with an unnoticed appeal; in par∣ticular,
an appeal of such magnitude as to
involve, at once, the peace, the happiness,
and the welfare of every individual. The
author's design is by no means to contend
for power, but protection for this oppressed
people; imagining that to be the sirmest basis
on which to establish the happiness of both
sexes.</P>
<P>It must be allowed, however, when custom
has given permanency to any practice, how∣ever
evil in its tendency, it is next to impossi∣ble
to effect its removal, or to succeed in any
reasonable claim; therefore I contend not
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>
with the lords of the creation, for any other
privilege than that protection, which they
themselves avow to be the <HI>real rights of
women.</HI> I would not have it understood,
that the generality of women, any more than
men, are incapable of acquiring the same
degree of knowledge and improvement in
literature; and happy am I to learn, that
this state of prohibition is not general; and
that a classical education, in some parts, is
not confined to men alone; for, if the author
is not misinformed, it is upwards of seven
years since there was an establishment formed
in Philadelphia, where youth and innocence
find protection from the guardian genius, In∣struction,
whose emblematical trophy may
very well be formed of Knowledge gaining
the victory over Ignorance.</P>
<P>But these advantages, in Britain, being mo∣nopolized
by the male sex, permit me to ask,
if it is not their duty, at least, to afford pro∣tection
in their slead; for, surely, if they re∣fuse
to protect, they have no right whatever
to govern.</P>
<Q><PB N="xi" REF="12"/>
<L>"Britons, attend! be worth like this approv'd,</L>
<L>"And shew you have the virtue to be mov'd."</L></Q>
<P>Therefore I am led to keep firmly to the as∣sertion,
that it is not power, but protection,
which is required; for the generality of wo∣men,
<HI>natives of this country,</HI> are so perfectly
tamed, either through custom or compulsive
submission, that, let but the lenient hand of
protection be stretched out to their aid, and,
doubtless, content and happiness will resume
their seat, and cheerfulness form the leading
feature, to bespeak the tranquillity of those
souls, which have been so long depressed.</P>
<P>All women possess not the Amazonian spirit
of a Wolstonecraft. But, indeed, unremit∣ted
oppression is sometimes a sufficient apo∣logy
for their throwing off the gentle garb of
a female, and assuming some more masculine
appearance; yet, when the curtain of misre∣presentation
is once withdrawn, it is to be
hoped, (not donbted) that the cause of com∣plaint
will quickly be removed,</P>
<P>It seems, however, very necessary to call
in some able assistants, and consequently I
<PB N="xii" REF="13"/>
make my appeal to reason, justice, and truth,
which, in checking the spirit of malevolence,
should it rear its hydra head to the prejudice of
the cause, will also be the means of shielding
the writer from the common censure which the
narrow-minded, in general, bestow on a first
production.</P>
<P>A serious statement of facts, it is to be
hoped, will be productive of good to great
numbers, who would be happy to relieve
their fellow-creatures, but whose exalted situ∣ations
in life too generally preclude them the
opportunity of obtaining a knowledge of the
real wants of the wretched, or the causes of
their sufferings; by exhibiting, though feebly,
a complicated picture of misery and distress.</P>
<P>Yet, it may not be amiss to observe, that
having made my remarks chiefly on real, and
not imaginary grievances, should any thing in
these pages do violence to the critical abilities
of any of my readers, whose superior educa∣tion
exalts them above the level of the interior
ranks of society, it is the writer's request, that
the intention may be kept in remembrance.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="14"/>
Still, methinks, I hear the voice of reason
reproaching me, after the many acknowledged
disadvantages, for attempting to write on a
subject of such weighty importance. Indeed,
considering the great number of eminent
writers that are daily displaying their erudi∣tion
in a variety of subjects, and in styles so
very far superior to my poor abilities, the un∣dertaking
were presumption itself. But,
amidst the abundant shew of publications
which are daily ushered into the world, I have
not seen one on a subject similar to this.
This alone is the exciting cause to my under∣taking,
in which it will be my utmost am∣bition
to be the humble means of directing
the tender eye of benevolence to worthy ob∣jects
of commiseration; or, inducing some
more able advocate to take up the cause of a
much-injured and oppressed part of the com∣munity.</P>
<P>Doubtless, in their journey through life, a
number of my fellow travellers have made the
same observations with myself, though they
have not made them public; yet, willing to
suppose <HI>that</HI> silence did not proceed from a
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/>
want of those philanthropic dispositions which
have, at all times, distinguished Britons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
will suppose this great omission, for undoubt
edly great it will appear, when properly in
vestigated, cannot possibly have been occa∣sioned
from any other cause than the force o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
custom, by which the greatest part of the com∣munity
have been so long hoodwinked; and
those grievances passed by in silence, of which
I am about to speak. Many excellent chari∣ties
this country supports, and many worthy
individuals seem to exult in stepping forward
to the aid of the distressed ; nor is it to be
doubted, that many more would as cheerfully
contribute in support of the still unfortunate
and oppressed, were they made acquainted with
the real objects: but, alas! when keen adver∣sity
strikes its pointed dart into the bosom of
the afflicted, the pain is too great to admit of
an explanation ; and when past, their only en∣deavour
is to bury its remembrance in obli∣vion:
therefore, unless some friendly hand take
up the pen, how can those, who are enabled by
fortune and prompted by compassion, stretch
forth the hand of clemency to distresses, of which
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>
they never heard; or, like the good Samari∣tan,
pour oil into wounds which they never
saw. In the mean time, then, let mine be the
painful, though voluntary, task; and even,
should the design not immediately meet with
the desired success, no doubt, but in a short
time it may, by the kindly interference of the
great, powerful, and humane investigators of
human calamities, to the emancipation of this
oppressed part of the human kind.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the Magdalen
charity, it is true, an objection was started,
which was founded upon this candid question:
"What will you do with such poor creatures,
when you have them?" But the difficulty
was as soon solved by Robert Dingley, Esq.
the first humane proposer of the charity. Nor
is there a doubt, were a similar enquiry to
take place, it would as soon be solved; for
what undertaking is too bold for man to at∣tempt,
when a restoration of happiness to his
fellow creatures is the object. I shall, then,
cheerfully proceed to offer the following ge∣neral
hints, which, it is hoped, will be im∣proved
upon to the good of society.</P>

<HEAD>THE
FEMALE ADVOCATE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART FIRST. THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF MEN
TRADERS ENGROSSING WOMEN'S
OCCUPATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>TO detail human misery in all its various
shapes is not in the power of any individual:
so complicated and numerous are the ills of
this life, and so various its misfortunes, that
we need not have recourse to the airy regions
of fiction or romance, to find out objects of
distress, to pourtray the woes of our fellow
creatures; yet, from motives of delicacy,
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
beg leave to withhold names, lest the suf∣fering
objects should feel hurt at the me∣lancholy
recital of their tale of woe; and
shall therefore only select a few instances, and
leave the candid moralist to take a compara∣tive
view of the rest, through all the wonder∣ful
mazes and wide tracts, to which a part of
our fellow mortals have been condemned.—And
by what? not by divine law, which is,
or ought to be, the standing rule of all our
action, but by an evil precedent, which hap∣pens
to fall with all its force upon that part of
the community, whose feeble powers of re∣sistance,
joined to an habitual passive submis∣sion,
are the least able to defend them. Con∣sequently
it has never yet been thought a
business worth investigation, although so many
others, of much less moment, have been
sought out, and redressed.</P>
<P>When we look around us, nothing is more
conspicuous in the eyes of the world, than
the distresses of women. I do not say those
whom a kind Providence hath placed under
the immediate care of a tender father, or an
affectionate and kind husband; or, <HI>by chance,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
a friend, or brother. But these, alas! com∣prise
only one part of the community. Not∣withstanding
all are of the same nature, and
were formed by the same Divine Power, yet
their comforts differ very widely indeed. Still,
as women seem formed by nature to seek pro∣tection
from man, why, in the name of jus∣tice,
refuse the boon? Does it not become
highly worthy the attention of men in general,
to consider in what manner to redress the
grievances <HI>already within their notice?</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it may be said, and very justly,
that, considering human frailty, there is
amongst women, as well as men, a vast num∣ber
of vicious and undeserving. Granted;
still, is it not better to pass over a hundred
guilty, than let punishment fall upon one
innocent person?—Besides, IS THERE NOT
A POSSIBILITY OF FORMING A PLAN OF
DISCRIMINATION, FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THOSE ONLY WHO MERIT SUCH HUMANE
AND FRIENDLY INTERFERENCE?</P>
<P>Some years ago, who would have been
made believe, so many persons could be re∣stored
to life, as the Royal Humane Society,
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
for the recovering of drowned persons, has
effected? Yet so it is; which proves to a de∣monstration,
the practicability of this de∣sign.
But before I proceed with my Hint for
e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecting any established plan, for the restora∣tion
of peace and happiness to the, perhaps,
once happy, but now most miserable of be∣ings,
I cannot help making a remark, that,
in order to lay a good foundation, every
builder must find it necessary, first, to remove
the rubbish out of his way—So let us proceed
to the ground-work of the design; and. be∣fore
any further sleps are taken, ask, What
can be said in favour of men-milliners, men-manu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a-makers,
and men stay-makers? be∣sides
all the numerous train of other proses∣sions,
such as hair-dressers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; all of
which occupations are much more calculated
for women than men. But, thanks to the fa∣shions
of the times, for once, which have near∣ly
exploded that disgraceful custom of men
dressing ladies' hair, by the introduction of
all the brutuses and chignons, of every deno∣mination,
which have found their way to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lets of all descriptions of females.—</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21"/>
Where is there a Stevens now? was there
ever a wider field for the display of his ta∣lents?
Yet, if perukes are the fashion of the
day, what is to prevent a woman from display∣ing
her taste upon a lady's head as well as a
man, who seems much better calculated for a
more masculine employment.</P>
<P>"Look," says an observer, "to the shops
of perfumers, toymen, and others of a similar
occupation; and, above all, look to the ha∣berdashery
magazines, where from ten to
twenty fellows, six feet high, may be counted
in each, to the utter exclusion of poor females,
who could sell a tooth-pick, or a few ribbons,
just as well."</P>
<P>A tax upon these fellows would be very sa∣lutary,
so say I ; yet, for a poor female indi∣vidual
to attack so numerous a body of men,
however insignificant by custom, is a bold
stroke, no doubt; yet, having thrown these sen∣timents
together, in defence of the oppressed,
even the censure of malevolence itself <HI>will</HI>
not prevent the truth, which, like a hunts∣man's
whip, cannot give pain to any <HI>but</HI> those
it touches : for, as no rule can be established
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
without exceptions, so in this case more than
one must be granted, which shall be treated
of in a subsequent part of these pages. To
class the innocent with the guilty would be
doing injustice to the cause.</P>
<P>But, in the mean time, where are these fa∣thers,
husbands, brothers, and professed friends
to virtue and happiness, who step not forward
in the business? No doubt but there are many
men of great probity and humanity, and yet,
through the progressive course of custom,
have not adverted <HI>either</HI> to the cause or its
fatal consequences; or, in fine, are not aware
of the real distresses of our fellow-creatures;
from which idea it is so frequently wished a
reference to facts may take place, since neither
the sufferings of these poor women, nor the
cause of their sufferings can possibly be known,
but by investigation.</P>
<P>It is not to be supposed but all, in some de∣gree,
share the: common misfortunes in life;
and few there are, however wretched their
situations, who cannot single out other beings
as bad, if not in a more deplorable state.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/>
But, in the case of these poor women, where
is there a state nearly equal to theirs? borne
down by fate's afflicting hand, they are not
able to act, or seck redress; and this, by the
unfeeling part of the world, we have too great
reason to fear, is termed idleness and profli∣gacy.</P>
<P>What a littleness of mind ! what an un∣feeling
and despicable meanness must lurk in
the breasts of those, who can, with impunity,
insult over distress! Into what fits of despera∣tion
have numbers of helpless females fallen
through these contemptible insults and revil∣ings,
and even neglects! for, it is in those
dark moments of distress, when the senses are
all alive to the fine feelings of nature, that
every nerve is relaxed and ready to receive
the fatal dart.</P>
<P>Then indeed it is, that she stands exposed in
the field of adversity, surrounded by every dis∣advantage,
without the aid of education, or the
guardian hand of protection; that is to say,
without either weapon or shield of defence: a
situation which, it is natural to suppose, would
draw pity from the most obdurate hearts. Yet,
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
how many are the instances of the censorious
part of the creation, dastardly and cruelly
assassinating and murdering the character of
these poor unfortunate victims, and those of
all murderers are the worst under heaven.
The common and detected murderer stands
exposed to the laws of his country, but the
assassin, who, under a cloak of hypocrisy,
can persecute and desame the characters of
oppressed females, are no longer worthy the
invaluable title of Christian.</P>
<P>Then, pass no longer, so unconcernedly and
without notice, the distressed and wretched
situation of the most helpless part of the cre∣ation,
who are not impowered by any means
whatever to defend themselves; having, by
the strong power of custom, so long been
deemed unworthy of notice.</P>
<P>O! may that auspicious day arrive. when
the curtain may be withdrawn, and the tragic
scene exposed to open view; when every
true Briton who reveres his Maker, or his
king, may cheerfully exert himself in the
general cause.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="25"/>
What greater satisfaction can the good
heart feel, than to be the instrument of draw∣ing
distress from the dark shades of obscurity
and wretchedness? In addition to which, are
we not fully convinced, from the words of
our blessed Teacher, that a kind and chari∣table
disposition towards our fellow-creatures,
is one of the greatest precepts of our religion?
Does he not say, by this the world shall know
you to be my disciples, if you love one an∣other.
Then, on the strength of divine exhor∣tation,
let us comfort these poor women in
the words of the immortal Milton:</P>
<LG>
<L>"Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,</L>
<L>"That wont to be more cheerful and serene."</L>
</LG>
<P>But with joyful expectation wait a relief to
those trying hardships which the unfortunate
part of poor females have so long sustained; not
doubting but some friendly and humane well∣wisher
to the distressed, <HI>and the public in gene∣ral,</HI>
will zealously undertake the cause, whe∣ther
individually, or in general, matters not;
for it is not to be supposed, all men are in the
same mind at once, or can obtain a sull know∣ledge
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
of the case at first view; but when once
begun, doubtless others will as quickly join
in the grand cause, and from a serious sur∣vey,
discover some mode of regulating this
complex business, which carries such a vast
train of grievances after it, and which is deeply
interwoven with the happiness of the great∣est
part of the people, connected with the
whole, will manifest itself to every serious
enquirer, and shall be more fully enlarged
upon, as we explore the dreary scene. But
I can never force myself to a belief, that
woman, the mother of all mankind, was ever
intended by Divine Providence to become a
butt, or mark, to receive so many piercing
darts from the sons of her bosom, as her only
reward for all that maternal affection and
kindness which the helpless state of infancy
and childhood render so necessary: inde∣pendently,
does it not seem a social interest
in nature, to give aid and succour to one an∣other?</P>
<P>No: it was never intended that women
should be left destitute in the world, without
the common necessaries of life, which they
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
so frequently experience, even without any
lawful or reputable means of acquiring
them, through the vile practice of men fill∣ing
such situations as seem calculated, not
only to give bread to poor females, but
thereby to enable them to tread the paths of
virtue, and render them useful members, in
some lawful employment, as well as ornaments
to their professions and sex. This lovely ap∣pearance,
alas! is but too often thrown aside,
and, frequently, <HI>not</HI> from vicious inclinations,
but the absolute necessity of bartering their
virtue for bread.</P>
<P>Then, is it not highly worthy the attention
of men, men who profess moral virtue and the
strictest sense of <HI>honour,</HI> to consider in what
mode to redress these grievances! for wo∣men
were ultimately designed for something
better, though they have so long fared other∣ways.</P>
<P>That there should he a mixture of characters
in the world is, beyond a doubt, for wise and
good reasons, which we poor short-sighted mor∣tals
know not, more than that it is a principle
in which all reflecting persons have agreed,
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
that our present state, on this side the grave
is certainly designed for improvement, in or∣der
to fit us for a better. This being admit∣ted,
where can the well-disposed find a better
opportunity, than by desending the innocent
and unprotected, selecting them from the
noxious part of mankind, with whom they are,
through keen adversity, obliged to associate;
and placing them in such situations, as will
enable them, to pursue the paths of virtue, by
means of some honest employment?</P>
<P>But to accomplish so laudable a design
rests both with the humane and the opu∣lent,
by whose investigation, there is not a
doubt, but it will be found a work of the ut∣most
importance, not only in the present state
of things but in looking forward to a succes∣sion.
For in times like the present, is not the
aid and assistance of men required in the mi∣litary
and naval departments? And in more
peaceable times, which we have to look for∣ward
to, are not, or ought not, the manufac∣tories
of the country to be the first object con∣sidered?
In either of these cases, it evidently
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
appears, that men may be much better employ∣ed
than in filling women's occupations. For, in
the words of St. Luke, these poor females
may very justly say, "to dig I cannot, to beg
I am ashamed." From this evil precedent,
there is no other alternative for these poor
women, but beggary or vice !</P>
<P>Let us then, if you please, select one of
these distressed females, out of the prodigious
multitude, and pursue her through the humi∣liating
scene of beggary: I believe it is grant∣ed,
that pride is well known to be the pre∣dominant
passion of the human breast, and
consequently any comments on that head are
needless; but certain it must be, that after,
perhaps, a life of ease and affluence, to be
compelled to such a mortifying situation, re∣quires
more than a common share of forti∣tude
to support. Still this prevailing passion,
with all its train of attendants, must be sub∣dued,
in the dreadful situation of beggary
which cannot fail to bring down the spi∣rits
of these unhappy victims, with more
oppressive force than it is in the power of
words to express, or pen to paint, and can
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
only be conceived, <HI>in part,</HI> by the silent
sensations of those who can adopt another's
woes, and trace the passions of the human
mind. For what must not be the perturba∣tion
of a mind like this, when dire necessity
compels the poor, neglected victim to pursue
such degrading steps, in order to support a
miserable existence! See her trembling
limbs, which are scarcely able to support her
load of wretchedness, whilst she asks an alms
from the casual passenger. She who, perhaps,
a short time since, charmed her acquaintance
with her sprightly conversation and vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuous
example, by one adverse stroke, is neverthe∣less
so soon become the contempt, the scorn,
and the outcast of mortals! Nor is this
wretched doom confined to youth alone; but,
by the cruel hand of fate, the poor, dejected
mother, as well as daughter, is condemned to
share the same direful misfortunes, and be re∣duced
to the same low state of wretchedness,
from which their characters are stigmatized
with infamy, and to which they unavoidably
fall a sacrifice. In this miserable state
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
they must for ever remain, until the spirit
of oppression and mistaken prejudice is
eradicated, and the heavy cloud of misre∣presentation
cleared away, through a proper
investigation of the cause, which, doubtless,
will lead to a conviction; that the distress
and wretchedness of these poor, abandon∣ed
creatures originate chiefly from the ava∣ricious
and mercenary views of that set of
beings, who are "Eating the bread of the
hungry, and drinking the drink of the thirsty."
Nor are these poor women allowed "to pick
up the crumbs," which will appear in the se∣quel.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let us, if you please, take
another view of this poor mother and her mi∣serable
daughter, in this forlorn and distressing
state of beggary, and there see what relief they
obtain, from their piercing accents and bro∣ken
sighs—little more, it is to be feared, than
contempt or insults. Even the hand of cha∣rity,
accustomed to bestow on the needy, no
sooner observes the appearance of youth, or
a capability of industry, than it is instantly
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
withdrawn, and kept in reserve (as it is
thought) for some more proper object.</P>
<P>Good heavens, what a scene of woe! when
the poor mother and her helpless daughter
are turned adrist, to the mercy of an unfeeling
world ; which neither their genteel education,
or delicate constitutions, broken down by po∣verty
and hardships, can prevent. O! what
distress, in a situation like this! The mo∣ther,
the fond mother, in the full bitterness
of maternal affection, takes another, and ano∣ther
view of her darling child; perhaps the
only remaining pledge of a late kind partner!
sees her still laden with the fruits of a
pious education at least; views her with un∣utterable
fondness, "whilst all the soft pas∣sions
of her tender soul throb through her
breast with unavailing grief," at the near ap∣proach
of their destruction! In vain do they
supplicate their former friends, for the voice
of censure has pointed them out as infamous!
Good God ! what grief can equal this? Aban∣doned
by friends, and left to the reproach,
contempt, and censure of a cruel world,
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
without a provision, or any probable means of
gaining a subsistence, or even the smallest
glimpse of distant hope.</P>
<P>And, though shocking to relate, yet such is
the miserable situation of thousands of de∣senceless
women.</P>
<P>Nor let the unfeeling and censorious part of
mankind refute the assertion, until provision
is made for the relief of all those who would
be both industrious and virtuous, had they the
means. After which, the remaining few
may justly be reckoned in the class of incorri∣gible
sinners, and be a sufficient mode of form∣ing
a discrimination.</P>
<P>But until that provision is made, it is in∣human,
base, and cruel, and beneath the dig∣nity
of a Christian, to load with infamy the
poor, neglected female, who suffers through
misfortunes, and the continuation of an evil
precedent; and whose passive virtue is, per∣haps,
at the very instant of calumny, offering
up the divine petition of, "Father, forgive
them, they know not what they do;" and en∣deavouring
to arm with Christian fortitude
herself and beloved child, according to the
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
advice of the wise man, who says, "Has
thou children, instruct them from their youth."
She remonstrates with the child of her bosom
not with standing she is her partner in wretched∣ness,
and still encourages her to persevere i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
virtue, and live in joyful hope.</P>
<P>"Let us, my dear child,"; says she, "form
our estimation of the world and its objects at
they deserve; remembering we are pilgrim;
and strangers here. Let us keep in view the
glorious prize; and let us soar above the
crowd of human difficulties, and rejoice tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the hand which made us is divine. Then, let
not our feet tread in the muddy paths of vice
nor suffer the purity of our good intentions to
be stained with a single act of disobedience to
a Supreme Power."</P>
<P>And under these and such like reviving
comforts, the effects of a religious and pious
education, she still endeavours to persevere in
virtue, though in the midst of poverty; a state
which, without the interference of the hu∣mane,
not any thing can hide them from but
the silent grave. Oh! let not then our ears
be polluted by the envenomed breath of cen∣sure,
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
but endeavour to remove the cause, as
well as stigma, which, like the pendulum to a
clock, sets every wheel of wretchedness in
motion; and by seriously investigating the
cause, searching deeply into the state of facts,
and the origin of this tribulation, let the
censure rest where it is due. For, is it not
enough, enough indeed! for the innocent to
struggle with the hardships of penury and
want, without the double load of malevolence?
Alas! even in this despicable state, they
are still liable to sorrows they never yet felt,
nor are even aware of; for the very means
they are driven to use, to obtain the trisling
pittance which they sue for, renders them ex∣posed
to the merciless hand of any avaricious
russian, who may be base enough to drag these
poor victims they know not where.</P>
<P>What says the Vagrant Act?—"Persons
who beg in the streets are idle and disorderlv;
and any person who apprehends and carries
such a beggar before a justice, shall receive five
shillings, when the said justice may commit
them to a house of correction."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="36"/>
However shocking the sentence, what num¦bers
of these poor objects have been drag¦ged
away by the ruthless hand of the unfeeling
savage, to some loathsome prison, without re∣gard
to the more refined or delicate sensation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of one or another? Good heavens! there
surely needs no Siddonian powers to heighten
such a tragic scene. She who, perhaps, was
reared with all the gentle softness and mater∣nal
care of a fond parent; she, who so lately
was looked upon as an ornament to her sex,
until the pressure of misfortunes compelled
her to seek for bread, to be at once confined
in a dark prison, there to be obliged to hear
all the opprobrious language of the very low∣est
set of beings, and that under a storm of
oaths and imprecations, which, of itself, must
pierce her very soul. There to have her ears
grated with the rattling of bolts and bars, and
all the adamantine setters of misery. Good
God! is it possible we can see our fellow
creatures debased so low ! Can we see the ten∣der
and delicate frame, which was formerly
accustomed to ease and tranquillity, and which
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
was formed by nature to participate in others
misfortunes! can we let these innocent and
helpless beings pass unnoticed, and not com∣miserate
their distress, and ask, from whence
the cause?—No! it is impossible the eyes can
any longer be shut to their sufferings, or the
ears to their piercing cries of, "Have pity on
me! Oh! ye, my friends, have pity on me!"</P>
<P>Is not this real distress? Surely there can∣not
be any thing more wretchedly miserable
than the situation of these poor women, who
are prohibited from sharing in industry, or the
common necessaries of life, or even tasting
the very dregs of comfort. For let us but
figure to ourselves this wretched pair upon
their bed of straw, with all their innocence,
with all their tenderness, and quick sensations
of distress, still laden with the fruits of a pious
education,
<Q><L>"They shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,</L>
<L>"And wake to all the ills they left behind."</L></Q>
And thus they linger out a wretched exile in
this miserable dungeon, until the law hath
had its course, and they again are liberated.
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
When see, the fond mother, the poor mother,
taking another, and another review of her
wretched offspring, groaning out a miserable
existence on the narrow verge of life! her
sorrow surrounds her like the stern winter's
blast, and she feels her worn-out senses just
bordering upon desponding madness; for,
when Hope no longer offers her consolation,
despondency must take place; and with all
the bitter pangs of distress, she, like the poor
widow in sacred writ, sets about to prepare
her last handful of meal, that "they may
eat it and die." A release they most ardently
wish for, whilst in a state of innocence, rather
than keep life upon such wretched terms as are
now presented: for, alas! by this time, they
see that period near at hand, which must de∣termine
the great and shocking alternative be∣tween
vice or death. And what must be the
conflict at this long-dreaded moment, to a heart
which, in early youth, was taught to serve
its great Creator, and still retains an ardent
wish to be virtuous! Can any state under
heaven be more distressing to a delicate and
susceptible mind, than that between good and
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
evil? And, how shocking it must be, at length,
to hear these poor victims of wretchedness,
defend themselves, by exclaiming, "I sought
not redress in vice, till urged to it by self∣defence,
in order to support an existence,
which, though I no longer covet, it is my
duty to preserve: nor is there any other re∣medy
for ills like mine; for, as the wise So∣lomon
says, "extreme oppression maketh us
desperate!"</P>
<P>What a horrid and shocking state! to be
driven, by absolute necessity, to support a
wretched existence by the forfeiture of every
thing she holds most dear in this life, and at
the hazard of what is still more precious, her
immortal soul !</P>
<P>Besides, what must not be the agonies of
her soul in this wretched state, on the dreadful
approach of death? a death which, though so
much desired in innocence, is dreaded with
so great horror in guilt, when all her crimes
appear at once to her distracted view. Worn
out with intemperance and disease, she feels
the dreadful period near at hand, when she
must appear before the grand tribunal!
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
How many are her penetential tears in such a
horrid situation? She calls, and calls again,
upon her great Creator, "O Lord, rebuke
me not in thy fury, nor chastise me in thy
wrath ; for who can stand before the face of
thy indignation?" And thus surrounded
with all these dismal and heart-piercing sen∣sations,
without a friend to comfort, or the
still more invaluable consolations of a dying
Christian ; her every sense is racked with hor∣ror,
and little unlike the infernal regions is
her wretched situation.</P>
<P>Whilst her associates in vice are revelling
in drunkenness, in order to banish from their
reflections all ideas of the horrid scene, and
thus she lies, "Groaning out the poor re∣mains
of life," her limbs bathed in sweat, and
struggling with convulsive throws, pains in∣supportable
throbbing in every pulse, and in∣numerable
darts of agony transfixing her con∣science.</P>
<Q><L>"In that dread moment, how the frantic soul</L>
<L>"Raves round the walls of her clay tenement,</L>
<L>"Runs to each avenue and shrieks for help,</L>
<L>"But shrieks in vain. How wishfully, she looks</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="41"/>
"On all she's leaving, now no longer her's.</L>
<L>"A little longer, yet a little longer."</L></Q>
<P>Thus her exhausted breath expires, and
she dies in all the bitterness of woe. And this
alike must continue to be the fate (as it has
been so long to numbers) of both parents and
children, unless the kind hand of interference
shall sever the chain of misery, by which they
have so long been held down.</P>
<P>But will not a serious investigation into
these scenes of horror be sufficient to arouse
the most callous of mankind? for who would
not use their utmost endeavours to relieve such
unheard-of distress? Or, what is still better,
prevent such dire calamities, and all such
complicated scenes of misery and wretched∣ness:
for, is it not always granted, that pre∣vention
is better than cure?</P>
<P>Then let it not be said, that a country so
samed for its justice and humanity, should
suffer a continuance of such distress; or that
any of our fellow creatures should be compel∣led
to take shelter under the baneful shades
of vice, in order to support a miserable exist∣ence.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42"/>
Much, <HI>very much,</HI> indeed, may be said or
this subject, but it is not my wish or intention
to delineate, or dwell longer upon the tragica
history, than may serve to lead to the avenue
of investigation ; when a small part of these
ftriking truths, to a reflecting mind, will be
sufficient to conciliate, and cause them to ex∣ert
a cheerful readiness to serve our fellow,
creatures; by doing which we are well assure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it is performing a three-fold duty, viz. to God
to our neighbour, and ourselves. I am ful∣ly
persuaded, it will appear equally as politic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as humane; for the poor, miserable, and op∣pressed
creatures cannot say with <HI>Job,</HI> "I
have erred, mine error remains with myself."
No : their crimes are contagious, and their er∣rors
extend and spread their baneful influence
through cities, towns, and whole countries, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the utter destruction of families of all descrip∣tions;
in which case, is it possible unwary
youth should escape ?</P>
<P>What numbers of unguarded young men,
even with hearts inclined to virtue, have un∣happily
been drawn on to vice, by the power∣ful
insinuations of these poor abandoned fe∣males,
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
who, like Eve in Paradise, is no sooner
fallen herself, than, by deceitful artifice, she
spreads the net of destruction to catch others.
For example: need we go any farther than
the theatres, the resort of all, both good and
bad, and where abandoned females, of all ages
and degrees of profligacy, attend to make their
harvest, and gather in their unlawful plun∣der,
to supply the ordinary wants of the en∣suing
day ? And what can better answer the
purpose of decoy than the drama? for, should
it be comedy, the obscenity which prevails in
many of our modern plays, cannot fail to act
as poison upon the young mind : or is it tra∣gedy,
what can have a greater influence upon
the feelings of sensibility, or sooner awaken
the tender passions, which these miserable
women take special care to translate to their
own evil purposes ? Perhaps, in drawing a
simile of their own distress, or by some other
artful representation or pretence, by which
such numbers of innocent and inexperienced
young men are artfully led astray, in their
most unguarded moments, whilst seeking a
rational and innocent amusement, as a relax∣ation
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
from the toils of the day, from which
too many have found themselves, at once, im∣merged
in destruction, and ingulphed in the
quicksands of vice.</P>
<P>Horrid destruction! if all, or the greatest
part, of this originates from women being pre∣cluded
from supporting themselves by means
of some lawful employment, who will conti∣nue
to countenance a precedent, big with so
much destruction?</P>
<P>How many unhappy young men have fallen
a sacrifice, both in mind and body, to the dia∣bolical
artifices which these poor, miserable,
abandoned women are driven to practice for
bread! And how many Barnwells, who, not
able to support, by honest industry, the wants
of a favourite mistress, have forcibly pursued
such methods as have brought them to misery,
shame, and death, and their distracted parents
with sorrow to their graves! leaving behind
them the remainder of an unprovided family,
to toil up the steep of difficulty; and, <HI>if fe∣males,</HI>
with all the tribulations before them
which we have been just tracing in others!</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45"/>
Nor does the dreadful calamity end here;
for, notwithstanding so many unfortunate fe∣males
have been obliged to seek bread in the
paths of vice, and so many young men have
fallen victims to their solly and wickedness,
still the same devouring jaws of destruction
are open for its future prey; nor can they ever
possibly close, until the grievous precedent of
men usurping females' occupations is entirely
done away, <HI>or some proper substitute provided,</HI>
so as to enable women to share the common
necessaries along with their fellow-creatures:
till then, we need not wonder at the vast
number of pickpockets and housebreakers
which, at all times, infest the streets, to the
disturbance of all civil society; for we may
again repeat with Milton, when night
<Q><L>"Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons</L>
<L>"Oh Belial, flush'd with insolence and wine."</L></Q>
For when "young men, void of understand∣ing,"
are seduced by such lawless and licen∣tious
methods to squander away, in riot and
drunkenness, what they have obtained by un∣lawful
plander, it is no difficult talk to find
<PB N="46" REF="46"/>
out the cause of these nocturnal depredations;
for we may naturally suppose, these poor un∣happy
women are always ready to benumb
and drown their reflections with intoxicating
liquors, the effects of which must lead them,
with their wretched associates, into every ex∣cess
of sin and wickedness, to the utter demo∣lition
of public happiness and safety, as well
as incurring a heavy burden of expences upon
the inhabitants.</P>
<P>It is said, the city of London alone pays
upwards of twenty thousand pounds annually
to patrols, beadles, and watchmen; and it
may be a much greater sum; yet, that of itself
seems a vast sum indeed, to be raised by levy,
in which the honest trader must unavoidably
contribute a large share. Would not that
contribution answer a much better purpose in
providing for the necessitous poor, such as we
have just been treating of, and who are judged
unfit objects to be received into a parish work∣house;
being, <HI>as it is termed,</HI> able enough to
earn their own bread out of the house?</P>
<P>Yet, so long as there continues a prohibi∣tion
against women having an employment, it
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
is to be feared, double the sum already raised
by the inhabitants will be found inefficacious.
But such is the link of progression, arising
from this dreadful usurpation; which shews
the necessity of entering into the origin of
these melancholy truths, that so the chain of
connection may be found whole; otherways,
far be it from me to entertain a wish to offer
to the generous part of my readers a work
fraught with so many tragic representations:
but, least the want of a full narrative should
leave the subject dark to comprehend, I still
pursue my plan; and even should my zeal in
the cause of happiness lead into an eccentric
mode of writing, be it remembered it is an
eccentric cause, but with a most sanguine wish
to see all the inhabitants of this favoured isle
become useful and happy members of society,
instead of being the harpies of destruction.</P>
<P>That political and private happiness are in∣variably
connected, is beyond a doubt; and
that the morals of this nation are very cor∣rupt,
is but too visible, from the vast numbers
of disgraceful women who infest the face of
the country. As for the number of these mi∣serable
<PB N="48" REF="48"/>
serable beings, it cannot be an easy matter to
ascertain : but suppose, from the prodigious
numbers, that are seen scattered about, like
sheep having no shepherd, that in London, for
example, there are five or six thousand: Nay;
I have either read, or heard it said, ten thou∣sand!
but how that calculation can be made,
I shall not take upon me to say ; yet, sup∣pose
we call it half that number; are not five
thousand destitute females too many to suffer
through so poor a cause, and will not a much
less number suffice to contaminate the morals
of more than half the youths in town, and
prove a source of destructive oppression to a
vast number of inhabitants? for, without mo∣rals,
how can we expect happiness, or what is
to support the public good?</P>
<P>Then, what sort of beings are they, who
can, with impunity, oppress these unfortunate
women, to the entire destruction of all happi∣ness,
both national and domestic? Or where
is the breast, truly warm in the cause of virtue
and a country's good, who will suffer the con∣tinuance
of a precedent so destructively op∣pressive,
without exerting themselves in the
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>
cause? for granting it is a great part of the
Christian religion, to assilt our neighbours
as far as we are empowered. To neglect an
investigation of these grievances admits no
excuse, when once the clouds of obscurity
are dispersed; for enquiry is the great source
of knowledge.</P>
<P>From the holy scriptures we learn, that
"Wisdom is justified in all her children;"
and from what but wisdom and justice is de∣rived
the support of our common weal, by
investigating which, will not the judicious
quickly discover a numerous train of oppres∣sive
grievances not yet told. Let him but en∣quire
the cause of such vast numbers of con∣victs
having been sent abroad, to the great
expence of the nation; and see if their
connection with these necessitous women
has not been a great means of their mis∣fortunes:
for, alas! young men, upon their
first entrance into the world, are too often in∣ebriated
with the pleasing, but baneful, draught
of pleasures, till their senses are so much in∣toxicated,
that they run they know not where,
and at length find themselves ensnared in
<PB N="50" REF="50"/>
the net, which these poor abandoned women,
or rather the instigators of their misery, have
so artfully set to entrap the unwary.</P>
<P>Yet, a serious consideration, no doubt, will
prompt an enquiry, and a perseverance in the
pursuit; and surely we may hope, an under∣taking,
founded on such a basis as the laws of
humanity, and a general good, can never fail
of success. Nor will the more generous part
of men-traders, such as are before described,
delay to resign a privilege, maintained upon
such unjust principles; for far, very far, be it
from me to suppose, or entertain a with to
insinuate a supposition, that all effeminate
tradesmen are equally guilty of a known vio∣lation.
Nor is any individual accused for in∣voluntary
crimes: yet, does it not behove
every member of society to inform themselves,
especially when the object of enquiry is of
such great magnitude, as to extend beyond
the interest of individuals, and affect a whole
community?</P>
<P>It is beyond a doubt, that many men,
through the force of custom, are ignorant of
the injury they are doing their neighbour,
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>
and mankind in general, the details of which
I have very scrupulously collected, and may
say with Shakespeare, I have "nothing exte∣nuated,
nor set down aught in malice."</P>
<P>Indeed, I have not a wish to accuse, or call in
question, the conduct or motive of any indivi∣dual.
No: suffice it that Pappeal to their own
feelings, to humanity, and the gospel truths;
after which, let the inward monitor of the
guilty say,
<Q>Thou art the man.</Q>
But permit me to infer, this self accusation
only extends to one part of the oppressive
body; yet, what is to be said for the re∣mainder,
who shall still persevere in perfecut∣ing
these poor helpless women, to the subver∣sion
of all civil society? for, are we not told
by the inspired writer, "It is not the will of
our Father, which is in heaven, that one of
these little ones should perish." Then, in
compliance with our threefold obligation, are
we not strictly enjoined to exhort our bre∣thren
to turn from their evil ways. What
says St. Matthew, "If thy brother shall tres∣pass
<PB N="52" REF="52"/>
against thee, go and tell him his faults:
but if he will not hear thee, then take wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thee one or two more, that in the mouth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
two or three witnesses, every word may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
established; and if he shall neglect to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
them, tell it unto the church; but if he ne∣glect
to hear the church, let him be unto the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as an heathen man and a publican.</P>
<P>But by what means, less than enquiry, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
we to know who our offending brother is? o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
why, in this enlightened age, is a business of
so much consequence neglected! a business on
which nothing less than the ruin or prosperity
of a state depends; independent of Christiani∣ty
or humanity, the great characteristic of the
nation. Then, in a case where the whole is
so strongly connected, why delay a single mo∣ment
in the research. Indeed, it is a well∣known
maxim, and must be allowed, that those
who are not forward in a cause, may be justly
said to be against it; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her words, who∣ever
is not the encourager of virtue, must un∣advoidably
be the encourager of vice. But let
the breast of sympathy participate in the suffer∣ings
of their fellow creatures. Let the tender eye
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>
of pity, which can so soon dissolve at an ima∣ginary
tragedy, a me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mock representation in
a theatre, be truly melted into pity at real ca∣lamity.</P>
<P>That great numbers would be happy in
contributing to the aid and relief of those who
appear to be objects of distress, is beyond a
doubt: but, alas! for helpless, injured females!
the heavy clouds of prejudice and misrepre∣sentation
have thrown so dark a veil between
them and the pity of the world, that they are
despised by all. Yet, when the curtain is once
withdrawn, and the tragic scene exposed to
open view, leading these poor creatures from
obscurity into open light, then will be the
crisis, when every good Christian may be
impowered to soften the affliction of another's
woes; and though it may not be in the power
of every sympathising breast to contribute to∣wards
their temporal wants, they may still be
impowered to sooth their sorrows, rather than
drive the envenomed arrows of censure still
deeper into their afflicted bosoms.</P>
<P>What kind of monument did the immertal
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervey make choice of for himself? "Let
<PB N="54" REF="54"/>
me," says he, "leave a memorial in the breasts
of my fellow-creatures. Let surviving friends
bear witness, that I have not lived to myself
alone, nor been altogether unserviceable in
my generation. O! let an uninterrupted se∣ries
of beneficent offices be the insc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iption,
and the best interests of my acquaintance the
plate that exhibits it. Let the poor, as they pass
by my grave, point at the little spot, and thank∣fully
acknowledge, there lies the man, whose
unwearied kindness was the constant relief of
my various distresses; who tenderly visited
my languishing bed, and readily supplied my
indigent circumstances. How often were his
councils a guide to my perplexed thoughts,
and a cordial to my dejected spirits."</P>
<P>And why may not the same inscriptive mo∣nument
belong to many? It is in the power
of any one to merit it, even by the good offices
and tender concern for these poor objects,
who, like a foot-ball, are still rolling upon the
surface, ready to receive the next stroke, with∣out
being able to make the smallest resistance.
Nor is there any other set of being under the
heavens, who stand in greater need of conso∣lation,
<PB N="55" REF="55"/>
than these poor unfortunate women:
or who, through vile censure, receive less;
consequently, the more desperate and distre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing
the case, the sympathy and condo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence the
more welcome; and will always, in some de∣gree,
soften and alleviate afflictions.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is not any, but the luke-warm, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
misinformed, who requires to be reminded of
su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h distress; for, where is the breast, truly

the sensations of pity, when it appears, the

through a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icious or depraved disposition, but
absolute compulsion; through the encourage∣ment

there is for unfortunate women, who are turn∣ed

by keen adversity, naked and destitute, in the

<P>What is life? a bare existence, when com∣pared

neither of which do these unfortunate women
experience: for, notwithstanding, sometimes
even difficulties are instructive, and, in many
cases, may prevent a number of unforeseen

from their not being empowered to

exercise their talents. It is truly shocking
to see such numbers of miserable wretches
wandering about without employment, or any
human comfort, either dressed up at the cost
of their virtue and peace of mind, or in so
wretched, forlorn, and abject a state, that they
scarely retain an appearance of their sex;
thus dragging on a miserable existence, which
nothing but the effects of a religious edu∣cation
can induce them to preserve. For,
what is life without hope? and where is there
the smallest glimpse of hope for them? they

from its being a precedent of long stand∣ing;
a wilful blindness, through avaricious

The latter of which we hope is the case,
that it may rest in their favour; for, where lit∣tle

in its infancy might not, nor, perhaps, was
not attended with the evils it has since pro∣duced;
for, in those days, when manufactures
and commerce were not so extensive, every
situation and scene in life were in a more con∣tracted
state, and while the father and the bro∣ther
were employed in trade, the mother and
daughters were employed in the domestic con∣cerns
of the household. In fact, they were
then the manufacturers also, and consequently
were never at a loss for employment; they
found enough to do in spinning, knitting, and
preparing necessaries for the use of the family,
which, being common, was not looked upon
as any degradation.</P>
<P>But were the tradesman, in this refined age,
to employ his wife or daughters in any such
low capacity, what would the world suppose,
or where would be his credit? Therefore, in
exploring the case and its evil consequences,
shall we not be well convinced, it is not cus∣tom
alone which ought to constitute a right;
for what precedent or practice ought to be
supported upon unjust principles. Doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less
there have been various precedents, which
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>
seemed good at the beginning, and yet have
been productive of much evil in the end, as
the one in question; at the commencement of
which, as I before observed, it might be, and
was, a very laudable pursuit; for, in those
days, when all things were in a more contract∣ed
state, and trade not so universally extend∣ed,
the father of a family was glad to dispose of
his sons to such mechanical branches of trade as
first presented, that his son might be empowered
to improve or increase his little fund, and be able
to make a provision, not only for himself, but
for a wife which, in primitive times, he was
obliged to endow.</P>
<P>Alas! how much unlike our modern days,
when women endow their husbands, and, with
large portions, frequently purchase a very
heavy bondage.</P>
<P>In fact, the generality of things appear to
be diametrically opposite to what they were in
former times.</P>
<P>We need but look back about three cen∣turies,
and then see the vast change; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or ex∣ample:
What would be the consequence, were
a labourer, in the present times, to receive no
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
better wages than a penny a day, which used
to be the standard even in the reign of Hen∣ry
VII<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide stat. 11th of Henry VII. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tat. 6. of Hen∣ry VIII. concerning artificers.</NOTE> and in the reign of Henry VIII.
it did not exceed three halspence? Must
not every one allow, so small a recompence, in
the present times, insufficient to exist upon,
and much less to support a family. Still, in
those days, it was found a sufficient provision,
and they could live comfortably upon it; but
the reason is evident; every article of provi∣sion
at that time bore a very inferior price to
what it does now. Wheat, for example,
which we may call the first grand article of
provision, sold in King Henry VII.'s reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Baker's Chronicle.</NOTE>
at so low a price as three shillings per quarter,
and every other article equally cheap; which
enforces a conviction, that through time all
things alter. Therefore, to come to the point
in view, whilst all things cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge according to
the state of times and conting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncies, why ex∣clude
poor females from a small share in the
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>
improvements? it is well known they cannot
defend themselves.</P>
<P>Were a body of miserable women, be they
really virtuous or not, to assemble with a pe∣tition
to parliament, where is the person who
would be persuaded to present it, particularly
when they are all considered as worthless
wretches.</P>
<P>But were a body of men a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tificers (be their
conduct or morals as they may) to offer a re∣presentation
of grievances, doubtless their case
would be hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and considered, in every sense
of the word, both political and humane.</P>
<P>Yet I would gladly believe, these differences
must alone proceed from the defect of not
knowing the true state of grievances; for, in
every other case of oppression, except the one
in question, do we not always find a protec∣tion
from the police of the country? conse∣quently,
there is no fear, but a serious investi∣gation
will throw open the iron gates of mis∣representation,
and lead to the avenues of
happiness, both for these poor women and
the community in general.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68"/>
I acknowledge, we are too apt to call things
just, that have been long in practice; and,
through ancient custom, these oppressive
tradesmen act in open defiance of either equity
or conscience, thinking none will call them
to account, and they may still ride triumph∣ant
upon the stream of avarice. But let not
a precedent, abounding with so much mischief,
any longer disgrace the age; let not virtue
and happiness any longer be bartered, which,
in the present case, they evidently are, to the
abuse of all civil society, and disuniting the
very bands of mutual benefit and preserva∣tion;
nor suffer these men to monopolize
the whole from the female part of the crea∣tion,
unless there is a provision made to se∣cure
them from penury.</P>
<P>Nothing, it is presumed, can be more rea∣sonable
and just, than that those who deprive
others of subsistence should contribute to their
support. For what law, either divine or hu∣man,
will justify the continuance of a prece∣dent,
which has influence sufficient to prevail
over the virtue of individuals? What statute is
there, which grants that men alone shall live,
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
and women scarcely exist?—Is it not an
usurpation which every violator must blush at,
when considered in the light it ought to be,
as an act of the greatest injustice? Then, drive
hence all such distress: let it not be said, that
Britons can cherish a wish to oppress their sis∣ters,
wives, and mothers, but rather that they
are merciful to the fatherless and the widow;
and though the mischief of this iniquitous
precedent should lie too deep to be cured by
any thing less than a total suppression, can it
be called an invasion of right? No; it is only
the supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession of an usurped prerogative;
and cannot fail to be productive of every
good, not only in clearing the streets of pro∣stitutes,
but in providing a sufficient number
of proper and fit hands, <HI>in time of peace,</HI> for
the various manufactories which, it must be
granted, it is always the interest of Britain to
cherish; and in such calamitous times as these,
by having ready a sufficient number of soldiers
and sailors fit for service, without being dri∣ven
to so many expensive and oppressive ex∣pedients:
independent of the little need there
is of throwing any thing in the way to send
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>
such colonies abroad, to the prodigious ex∣pence
of the nation, or suffering such numbers
of men idling at the back of a counter, when
they might be employed to so much better
advantage. The enormous expence attending
all these things, must be visible to every one
who will take the trouble to look; therefore,
it is unnecessary to weary my readers with a
recital of these heavy expences or grievances,
far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her than is absolutely necessary; for a short
reflection must convince every enquirer, that
to countenance this evil precedent, is not only
robbing poor females of their birthrights,
which they are not empowered to contend for,
but is actually robbing the whole country of
its right, as well as safety and happiness, and
doubtless is tending to impoverish the nation.</P>

from Adam to Magna Charta, and
from thence to the present day; when, alas!
it is a female's province only (if a mother) to
nurse, cherish, and watch over her darling

foremost in adding to the weight of this op∣pressive
burden. "Art thou one of them!"
said Julius Caesar to his son, when he saw him
amongst those that murdered him. That went

feel, on the bare appellation of idle and disor∣derly,

<P>Under such a pressure of misfortunes,
they must bear their sorrows in silence, un∣known

pass their time in sorrow, till they meet the
<PB N="74" REF="74"/>
fatal alternative, either to be passive under the
horrors of a prison, or compound for their
preservation, by entering under the infernal
roof of vice for protection.</P>
<P>When such an alternative is presented, what
is to be expected? Should they evade the lat∣ter
by conforming to the former, what is to
be the advantage? I believe, it is generally al∣lowed,
that all prisons, or places of confine∣ment,
are but poor schools for virtue; and
that youth and inexperience, or even those

for it is not to be supposed, that these

should they even pass through these tracts

deep penetration and strict justice of such as
are in power, there is not a doubt, but some
plan will be adopted for the benefit of the

the avenue which leads to so much misery.
Doubtless, through the vicissitudes of human
affairs, neither great riches nor great happiness
<PB N="78" REF="78"/>
are always permanent; the dark and crooked
paths of fate are, by the unerring hand of Di∣vine
Providence, hid from mortal eyes: nor
can we see into futurity. "To-day we are here,
and to-morrow in the grave;" or, according
to the Proverbs, chap. xxvii. v. 1. "Who
knoweth what a day may bring forth?" For
how often does death, insatiable death, unex∣pectedly
snatch, in a moment, the indulgent
parent from the beloved child, who is at once
left at large in the wide world, perhaps in the

of artless youth, without a provision, or any

of her woeful loss, in parents and provision,
may, in some degree, be wiped away in the
benevolence of her new protectors, who not
only provide for her temporal, but also for her
spiritual concerns, in instructing her as a good
Christian and a useful member. But, alas!
small is the number which this institution
can admit, when compared with the vast num∣bers
left in similar situations. And for those,
who are more advanced in age, to what stand∣ard
can they repair? It is true, necessity will
teach people to exert themselves, who have no∣thing
but their own industry to depend upon,
and consequently they seek for a female occu∣pation.
But how great their surprise, and inex∣pressible
their grief, to find, like the rest, that
they are repulsed in every pursuit of industry,
whereby they might expect a maintenance!</P>
<P>Good Heavens! what course can a poor,
young creature pursue, when, from the quick
transition from good to evil, at that early pe∣riod
of life, when discernment has not made its
way to a knowledge of the world, she is at
once on the verge of the precipice, where so
many have unhappily been lost? Without a
<PB N="80" REF="80"/>
pilot, she finds herself launched out into the
ocean of the world, where she floats about so
awhile, until she perceives her danger, and
would gladly retreat; but neither meeting pro¦tection
nor aid, necessity drives her back, and she
shortly engages in the dissipation of the
age, and at once becomes the object of sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and contempt, and the real food for scandal
in which deplorable state she finds herself in¦volved,
even before she is aware of her dan¦ger,
which no sooner presents itself to he
view, but she endeavours to retreat and clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
away the black vapour; but, alas! though
short-lived the experiment, it is now too late
for the misty cloud of obloquy has discoloure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
her reputation, and she is now doubly distan
from a friend to defend her, or point out
mode of redress; for the unfeeling part of the
world exclaims, in the words of a much ad∣mired
writer,
<Q><L>"How shall I then your helpless fame defend?</L>
<L>"'Twill then be infamy to seem your friend."</L>
<BIBL>POPE</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>No: her supplication is not noticed, not
<PB N="81" REF="81"/>
withstanding "God hath given to every one
the charge of his neighbour."</P>
<P>This excellent charge being so very seldom
put in practice, superadded to her youth and
inexperience, she not being sufficiently armed
with that fortitude, which is so necessary in
her time of trial, and seeing the frowns of the
world against her, she naturally perseveres,
and even launches out still farther in the
stream of those false and mistaken pleasures,
which cannot fail to terminate in her destruc∣tion;
and, perhaps, at length, she triumphs
in obtaining (what she thinks) protection from
those whose acknowledged right it is to guard
the weaker sex.</P>
<P>But here, alas! under the specious name of
friendship, she too soon sees her mistake, and
finds herself the real object of distress, aban∣doned
by the world, and left to her own bit∣ter
reflections; until the kind hand of Provi∣dence
once more takes her under protection,
and admits her a member of that humane
charity, the Magdalen; where, in a small de∣gree,
she is once more permitted to taste a
portion of comfort, by the cheering rays of
<PB N="82" REF="82"/>
Christian charity; and her oppressed spirits
are somewhat enlivened by the following sweet
and comfortable discourse from the Matron,
on her admission into that most excellent cha∣rity.</P>
<P>"You cannot be insensible of the kindness
of providence in bringing you hither; the
wretched situation you are reduced to seems
to offer you no other relief. Your interest
and ours is the same; we mean to do you
all the good we can, and you to have good
done to you; we mean to render you happy
in this world, and what is of much greater
moment, in the next also<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Rules and Regulations of the Magdalen Cha∣rity.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>How can charity be better employed than
in taking care of the soul as well as the body?
This is, perhaps, the most comfortable dis∣course
she has heard since death closed the lips
of her dear parents. Yet how much greater
would be the charity for protecting the inno∣cent,
than in reclaiming the guilty? Preven∣tion
must certainly be better than cure; and
<PB N="83" REF="83"/>
were there a capacious establishment for indus∣try,
built upon such a basis as would form a
discrimination between the well-bred female,
who is reduced by the unseen hand of fate, and
the very poor and abject, whose birth has de∣prived
them of the knowledge of resinement or
delicacy; what crouds of unprovided women
would slock to the standard!</P>
<P>But, in the mean time, it cannot fail to af∣ford
infinite satisfaction to the humane con∣tributors,
by enabling the poor penitent to re∣peat
the following hymn of admission.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Rise, O my soul! the hours review,</L>
<L>"When aw'd by guilt and fear,</L>
<L>"Thou durst not heaven for mercy sue,</L>
<L>"Nor hope for pity here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Dried are thy tears, thy griefs are fled,</L>
<L>"Dispell'd each bitter care;</L>
<L>"See, heaven itself has lent its aid,</L>
<L>"To raise thee from despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Here then, O God! thy work fulfil,</L>
<L>"And from thy mercy's throne,</L>
<L>"Vouchsafe me strength to do thy will,</L>
<L>"And to resist my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="84" REF="84"/>
<L>"So shall my soul each power employ,</L>
<L>"Thy mercies to adore,</L>
<L>"Whilst heav'n itself proclaims with joy,</L>
<L>"One pardon'd sinner more."</L>
</LG>
<P>How nearly do the humane contributors to
this excellent charity imitate the compassion∣ate
sentence of our blessed Lord, when he
bade the offending woman "Go, and sin no
more?" For there is scarcely a period in
life, when the most irregular characters may
not be reclaimed. It is through misfortunes
and a want of employment, that such as
these poor, helpless, young creatures have
brought so great an additional load of heavy
misfortunes upon their guilty heads; yet, we
are told, there is joy in heaven at the repen∣tance
of a sinner:—What a blessed institution,
then, to provide a means for that purpose!</P>
<P>Human nature is undoubtedly liable to
corruption, yet it is impregnated with the
seeds of virtue; and when the mind is proper∣ly
cultivated, they will quickly grow up and
ripen into good works. It must afford a most
lively and pleasing sensation to the humane
and sympathising breast, in contributing their
<PB N="85" REF="85"/>
endeavours, to let the memory of former
woes be lost in the enjoyment of present bles∣sings.</P>
<P>Compassion is a heaven-born virtue, and
not only consoles the innocent, but is the first
step to reclaim the guilty: a kind and gentle
treatment must ever be efficacious, when harsh
proceedings, in general, drive to desperation.
For the truth of this, we need but scrutinize
our own hearts, (the golden rule is a most
excellent guide) and there see, on a serious
investigation, if any one of us is not more
ready to comply, in any case whatever, by le∣nient
means, than from the force of peremp∣tory
methods.</P>
<P>Yes: the most obdurate sinner, if possessed
of one single spark of grace, on the repeated
calm admonitions of a good Christian, cannot
suppress that spark from kindling into a flame
of gratitude, at least, and must blush at their
perfidy; whereas the hardened wretch, by
constant upbraidings and severe treatment, be∣comes
callous to every thing.</P>
<P>Therefore, these poor young women, who
have, through extreme necessity, been driven
<PB N="86" REF="86"/>
to criminal and unlawful pursuits, are not to
be despised or sunk beneath our care, but
cherished and supported, in order to reclaim
their wicked course of life. What says the
oracle of truth?—Whilst we have time, let
us do good, for the night cometh, when no
man can work.</P>
<P>For the opulent, and those in power, to
suppose they have done their part, in help∣ing
to relieve their spiritual wants only, is a
mistake; so long as the soul and body act
in unison, provision must be made for their
temporal necessities also. What says St.
James, chap. ii. v. 15 and 16. "If a bro∣ther
or sister be naked, and destitute of daily
food, and one of you say unto them, depart
in peace, be you warmed and filled, notwith∣standing
you give them not those things which
are needful to the body, what doth it profit?"</P>
<P>But in the humane charity of the Mag∣dalen,
as well as in others, the wants of the
needful are plentifully supplied, both as to
soul and body, and as many destitute objects
received as the foundation of the institution
will admit; and, in general, such as these it
<PB N="87" REF="87"/>
is of whom we have been discoursing (if in
London) who reap the benefit. Their ages
of admission being from sixteen to twenty-six
years, between which periods they, in general,
find their fatal mistake, and are happy to find
an asylum under so beneficent an institution.
Or if, unhappily, their situations in life are
too far distant, or other casual accidents pre∣vent
them from obtaining the benefit, they
must inevitably fall a victim to their misfor∣tunes
and vice, and the world's contempt.
Which brings to my remembrance a poem,
entitled The Country Church Yard.</P>
<Q><L>"Where the long grass obscures yon briery grave,</L>
<L>"And antique yews their branches sadly wave,</L>
<L>"A wretched female, with the silent dead,</L>
<L>"Unnotic'd, unlamented, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ests her head.</L>

<L>"Left thee alone in life's wide course to move."</L></Q>
<P>Notwithstanding the misfortunes of such
poor young creatures are truly pitiable, others
there are whose case is still more lamentable.
But to conduct my readers to the various ave∣nues
which lead to the destruction and misery
of the female part of the creation, would
swell this volume to a greater bulk than is in∣tended;
therefore shall content myself with
just touching upon a few characters, who have
been plunged into this dreadful pit of destruc∣tion,
by the known misconduct of connections,
or the mishap of human events. From such
as these it is we must gather our information.
Doubtless, imagination might lead to a num∣ber
<PB N="89" REF="89"/>
of visionary flights, but, by engaging with
personalities, the faculties are confined, and
external appearances must distinguish the ob∣jects.</P>
<P>Let us then commence with a gentleman of
small, independent fortune; for, as it is the
general maxim through life, that every one
should endeavour to outvie his neighbour, the
gentleman also must keep up appearances for
the benefit of his family (as he is pleased to
term it;) and, in the present day, where do
we see the father or mother of a family, with
an independent fortune, be it ever so small,
who would not be shocked at the bare idea of
placing their daughter in the world in such
situations as would enable them to rise, through
their own industry and merit, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it them for
becoming wives to some honest and industrious
tradesman?—No: that would be a degrada∣tion
which must not take place. It is the eti∣quette
of the times for the daughters to be bred
fine ladies, although it be without a fortune,
either dependent or independent, to support it.
As for trade, that is out of the question. The
sons indeed are differently provided: the el∣dest,
<PB N="90" REF="90"/>
in course, inherits the paternal estate
and the younger ones are placed in the church
the army, the navy, or at the bar; and others
again are genteelly situated in the mercantile
world: the whole of which are fit professions
for a gentleman, and by which, if they have
merit and success, they may acquire a com∣petency.</P>
<P>But for the female part of the family, what
appears in their favour? what prospects have
they in life?—The parents die, and leave
them, without a provision, a burden upon
their connections; which forms the first step
to deprive them of friends as well as subsist∣ence.
A miserable inheritance, to be their
best and only portion! What can be said in
behalf of such parents? can their easy compli∣ance
with the fashion of the times form any
apology for such a mistaken conduct?—This
surely cannot be called true paternal affection,
to entail upon these helpless young crea∣tures
such a succession of misery as must even∣tually
ensue. Is not this a sufficient definition
of the second divine commandment, that
"the sins of the father shall descend to their
<PB N="91" REF="91"/>
children, to the third and fourth generation."
Which under such circumstances is justly ve∣rified;
for, what less than a miracle can
destroy the entail of misery brought upon
helpless innocence, by the sins of their pa∣rents?
which, however harsh the term, is
worse than Herod's cruelty; that could only
affect the body, but by a compliance with this
mistaken folly of the day, there is a great
chance of its affecting the soul also.</P>
<P>What was it brought ruin upon the first dis∣tressed
female, who was admitted into the
Magdalen Charity; and what but a miracle
led her to taste comfort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a book, entitled The Magdalen, or a History of the First Penitents received into that charitable Asylum.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>What numbers of helpless and destitute
young women there are, who, seeing them∣selves
neglected and despised by their connec∣tions,
notwithstanding all the refined and de∣licate
ideas which their education and mode of
bringing up have possessed them with, would
gladly endeavour, through necessity, to make
up the deficiency of their parents' neglect, by
<PB N="92" REF="92"/>
putting themselves forward in the world, in
order to obtain a support. But, alas! to their
sorrow, they quickly see it is not in their
power; for, under their present circumstan∣ces,
"the world is not their friend, nor the
world's laws;" and what was not effected by
their parents, cannot possibly be obtained by
an inexperienced young woman.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is frequently said, the female part
of the creation are by far the most ready in
censuring their own sex. But permit me to
ask, would it not be highly reprehensible in
any lady to countenance even the appearance
of a guilty conduct? By so doing, it is not
only the means of encouraging vice, but must
unavoidably incur censure upon herself,
which, above all other misfortunes in life, is
the most to be dreaded, since a female charac∣ter,
once lost, is for ever irretrievable. But, in
justice to my own sex, I would gladly hope,
there is not a female, who really considers the
many horrid mischiefs which are the attend∣ants
upon censure, who will ever suffer the
smallest intimation thereof to escape the
<PB N="93" REF="93"/>
bounds of her own breast, unless through the
most flagrant proofs of guilt.</P>
<P>Out of the many, some there are, no doubt'
who, to colour their own vicious lives, are
ever ready to murder the character of any one,
without taking the smallest thought or concern
as to the consequences, nor even sparing the
innocent with any greater degree of lenity than
they would the guilty. But of this class we
hope there are but few; for, why should it
be supposed that female objects in distress,
particularly those who have youth and beauty
on their side, must unavoidably be objects of
contempt rather than pity? From what motive
can this certain part of the sex continue to
load the sufferings of these poor, helpless wo∣men
with reviling and contempt? None other,
must repeat it, but to draw a veil over their
own vicious lives; for neither religion nor vir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue
ever countenanced so much injustice. To
cad the poor sufferer with calumny, is cruel
indeed; suffice it, she has to struggle with
the hardships of penury!</P>
<P>Let them be traced along from the moment
that fate's afflicting hand is stretched out against
<PB N="94" REF="94"/>
them: trace them through every stage of life
and then see if they are not the most pitiab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of all mortals! Then, how can the time of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
opulent part of the sex be better employed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in searching into the source of their sorrow
and endeavouring to obtain redress? To in
vestigate the cause will be speak a remedy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
at hand. But for a continuation of the va∣rious
distresses which poor females are subject
to, we need but take a general review, an
represent the case as it evidently is, which
will save the unpleasant task of using names:
for, it is to be feared, few there are who have
any knowledge of life, but can reason upon
this subject, if not through fatal self-expe∣rience,
yet through experimental observations
on others. For example: how often do we
see whole families entirely ruined by the im∣proper
conduct of a husband or father, who,
through giving way to some predominant vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
at once overwhelms the whole of his family <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
ruin and distress, or, at least, the female <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of it, who, not being able to defend themselves,
or seek redress, are liable to every misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="95"/>
How far the wife was intended to be the
slave to her husband, I know not, but certain
we are, she was designed to be his friend, his
companion, and united part; or, according
to the gentlemen's phrase, his <HI>better part;</HI>
and yet how often do we see her sinking un∣der
the burden of a household load, whilst the
unfeeling husband is lavishing away the sub∣stance
which ought to be for the comfort and
support of a family? Yet such unnatural be∣ings
there are, who, by giving way to some
unlawful passion, can, without scruple or re∣morse,
trample under foot all laws, divine
and human, and with impunity bring wretch∣edness
upon those he is bound to support:
notwithstanding St. Paul tells us, "if any one
provide not for his own, and especially those
of his own house, he hath denied the faith,
and is worse than an infidel."</P>
<P>Let us but look at the many unhappy
females, who come to ruin through merce∣nary
marriages. How many are the instances
of young women, who have been brought up
in affluence, and reared with all the tender
care and attention, which are in the power
<PB N="96" REF="96"/>
of maternal affection to bestow; yet, perhaps,
through her youthful follies and credulity, she
is led away by the artifice and false pretensions
of one of these mercenary men, on whom she
cheerfully bestows her patrimony, whether
acquired by inheritance, or the smiles of for∣tune
upon the honest industry of her deceased
parents, avails not, for her expected happi∣ness
is vanished in empty air, and she is quick∣ly
exposed to all the ills of fate.</P>
<Q><L>"O thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate,</L>
<L>"Too soon dejected, and too soon elate.</L>
<L>"Sudden their honours shall be snatch'd away,</L>
<L>"And doom'd for ever this victorious day."</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>As leading to a further explanation, let us
represent a case which very frequently hap∣pens.
A gentleman's daughter, one of these
well-bred young ladies, which was spoken of at
the beginning of this discourse; or be it a
tradesman's daughter, it matters not, they be∣ing
equally trained up in the same liberal plan
of female education, married to a respectable
and worthy tradesman, who, we will say, ac∣cording
to the common run of the times, has
<PB N="97" REF="97"/>
made choice of a very proper partner for su∣perintending
the domestic concerns of his
household, and conducting a table with taste;
which, according to the beau monde, must un∣doubtedly
be complied with, since his credit
in trade so greatly depends upon appearances;
and however great may be his dislike to the
practice, yet <HI>he</HI> it is that is absolutely obliged
to comply with the custom of the times, and
make a figure in life, in order to support the
credit of his trade; a precedent big with every
evil consequence, yet he must comply, and act
like his neighbour, if he expects to receive
neighbour's fare. Therefore, before we cen∣sure
or condemn such conduct in any one
individual, let us, if you please, place choice
and necessity in the scales of justice, and see
which will preponderate.</P>
<P>I recollect an observation upon this subject
some time ago, made by a noble and very
learned man, the Earl of—. Says his lord∣ship,
"it is the tradesman and mechanic who
are under the necessity of making a figure in
life, in order to catch notice and obtain credit
in their line of business." But, continued his
<PB N="98" REF="98"/>
lordship, "for such as me there is no oc∣casion,
and consequently we can save whilst
they are obliged to spend: we can live as we
please, dress as we please, and, in fine, act as
we please; for our independence and ancestry
will always command respect, and enable us
to do as we like."</P>
<P>I must confess, I thought it was a hard case,
that so many sensible, clever men, of an infe∣rior
class, with regard to pecuniary matters,
should absolutely be held down for what was
not a fault; but, after a moment's considera∣tion,
I could not help joining in the validity
of his lordship's opinion. Although I knew,
at the same time, his lordship was frequently
ridiculed for the meanness of his table and
dress; yet, it occurred to me, that <HI>did not</HI>
erase any names from his lordship's rent-roll;
though the same conduct might occasion a
great deficiency in a tradesman's ledger.</P>
<P>In fine, need we advance any further than
Change-alley for a confirmation, that it is in
compliance with evil customs, and a confor∣mity
to destructive precedent, that bring on
such a train of misfortunes, with the greatest
<PB N="99" REF="99"/>
force, which is sure to fall where there is the
least resistance? How frequent and sudden
are the fluctuations in the stocks, owing to the
artifices of stock-jobbers, under some false
pretence or other: notwithstanding it is a
practice so highly detested, both by govern∣ment
and the generality of the parties con∣cerned,
yet appearances take the lead; so that,
however wrong the practice, since the trades∣man
finds the absolute necessity of acting like
his neighbour, no doubt but a generous public
will either point out an expedient, or absolve
<HI>him,</HI> at least, from censure, let the conse∣quence
prove how it may. Pope says.</P>
<Q><L>"True consciencious honour is to feel no sin,</L>
<L>"He's arm'd without that's innocent within:"</L></Q>
<P>and very justly so, <HI>with regard</HI> to men; but
for poor women, the weight of all these griev∣ances
must unavoidably rest upon them, as the
weakest sex; who, having struggled through
the labyrinth of misfortunes, no sooner arrive
at the gate of industry, viz. <HI>female occupa∣tions,</HI>
than they find it shut, and men, so much
stronger, and in power, the porters at the door.
<PB N="100" REF="100"/>
So, begging pardon for the digression, we will
leave these poor unfortunate women at the gate,
and peeping through the wicket to no effect,
till we proceed with our young couple, who
journey on a few years through this maze of
life, a life that seems calculated for felicity,
happy in each other, and blessed with a rising
progeny, which, in course becomes the mo∣ther's
care, whilst the father, attentive to the
interest of his family, endeavours to extend
his trade for the mutual advantage of all; and
thus tied with the silken bands of unity, they
pass their days in one continued round of
bliss, actuated by the amiable endearments of
the affectionate father, the fond husband, and
the generous friend. But, alas! how fre∣quently
does the malice of fate unseen, pur∣sue,
and often blast, the happiness of human
enjoyments.</P>
<Q><L>"Ah gentle pair! ye little think how nigh</L>
<L>"Your change approaches, when all these delights</L>
<L>"Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,</L>
<L>"More woe, the more your taste is now of joy."</L></Q>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL>
<PB N="101" REF="101"/>
<P>Next, let us suppose, which supposition too
is frequently realized, that the father of this
happy family. whom we have just left in the
sunshine of prosperity, and in the full enjoy∣ment
of conjugal and paternal bliss, is snatch∣ed
away by the hand of death, and leaves his
disconsolate widow, in the meridian of her
days, surrounded by her innocent offspring, who
must now look up to her alone for protection,
which even herself may stand in need of.</P>
<P>How keen, how poignant must be her grief
at such a separation, when, at once, she is
robbed of a tender husband, and her children
of an indulgent father! Yet, like a true
Christian, she endeavours to arm herself with
such fortitude as is necessary to support her in
the time of trial; and by the help of reason
and religion, she begins to revive, and slatters
herself with new hopes, in the many comforts
she is to receive from her darling children.</P>
<P>Short-fighted mortal! she now begins to
take new courage, from having subdued her
stubborn heart to submit, as she thinks, to her
greatest affliction; which, alas! is no more
than a prelude to her future misfortunes: for
<PB N="102" REF="102"/>
her late husband's concerns come next to be ad∣justed,
when it is found there is a very small
provision, if any, left for herself and helpless
children: for the deceased husband, having
been under the necessity of deceiving the
world by the vile pretext of appearances, has
now involved his family in the unavoidable
necessity of seeing the world had deceived
him; the dreadful consequences of which they
are now left to struggle with. These are real
trials: yet how frequently do they happen!
and now, at once, are all her expectations of
future happiness blasted; an intervening cloud
has darkened the scene, and that maternal
triumph which used to gladden the face of the
fond mother, is now done away by the dark
gloom of adversity; and her sorrows are like
the impetuous torrent. A family, brought up
and educated with the idea of being gentlemen
and ladies, who have just been figuring away
in the gaieties of life, to find themselves en∣tangled
in a wilderness of misery, without
money, and consequently without friends, or
any means of support, requires more than hu∣man
strength to combat; for, in such a me∣lancholy
<PB N="103" REF="103"/>
situation, independent of real want,
the struggles of reluctant nature are not easy
to suppress. The parent, the virtuous and
tender mother, sees her darling offspring, with
all their innocence about them, upon the
verge of destruction, yesterday, in the full en∣joyment
of all the happiness this world can
bestow, and to-day turned ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist into the wide
world, attended with all those fine and delicate
feelings which nature, education, and a pious
example could bestow. Yet, all cannot save
them from the cruel hand of fate, the die is
cast, and they must now bid adieu to the com∣forts
of life, and plunge forward in an ocean
of misery; for▪ by this time, their small fund
being nearly, if not quite, exhausted, the dis∣tressed
mother finds the absolute necessity of
making her unhappy situation known to some
relation, or former acquaintance, which she
had used to call friend. But, alas! she has
yet to learn, the world in general takes but
little concern for the fate of individuals, and
too oft, will sooner upbraid than relieve dis∣tress;
and so precarious is the possession of
friendship, that, <HI>in general,</HI> on the approach of
<PB N="104" REF="104"/>
distress, it dissolves like snow under the rays of
the sun, or evaporates, like ether, at the ap∣proach
of poverty: yet, such an unfeeling class
there are, who, in prosperity, used to extol her
conduct; and are, perhaps, at the very moment
decking out themselves, table, and family after
her example, and yet can be the first to brand
her name with obloquy.</P>
<P>O, cruel censure, are not the pangs of dis∣tress
and poverty enough to bear! is this
Christian charity! is this acting the part of the
good Samaritan! Yet, yet, it is past dispute,
that such distress does afflicted poverty expe∣rience,
although the cordial of friendship, and
the benevolent sympathy of fellow mortals
would so very much alleviate: however, by
woeful experience, beginning to see the world
in its true colours, she fees her only resource
is in the consolation of religion, and in an hum∣ble
submission to the Divine Will; and with
this shield, she endeavours to guard herself
and innocent suffering offspring from the
impending, storm which appears ready to
burst upon their unfortunate heads. Still
their pious and laudable endeavours will
<PB N="105" REF="105"/>
not alone supply the necessity of extreme
want; they are mortal, and consequently both
nature and duty press hard upon the un∣happy
mother, to look into the world for a
means of support; for now every prospect of
happiness to her future days is blackened
by anxious care, and, perhaps, at a period
which might have been expected the happiest
of her life: but since adversity has taught
her submission, and she finds she has to climb
up the sleep of difficulty, with her children
dragging after her like so many clogs at her
feet, to retard her progress, her first step is to
look out for situations for her sons, to whom
Providence having denied an education, so as
to command such situations in life as the ge∣nerality
of men are enabled to look up to, and
without the aid of connections, or friends, to
lead them out into the world; if the poor mo∣ther
can obtain for them a situation at the
back of a counter, it is the highest step in life
which she can sue for, <HI>or expect; and such as
these,</HI> indeed, are an exception as to filling
women's occupations; for, if nothing else pre∣sents,
what are they to do? But for the poor
<PB N="106" REF="106"/>
mother, who perhaps has not yet attained
her thirty-fifth year, and her still unfortunate
daughters, what is there in their favour? with∣out
money, friends, character, or means of in∣dustry,
they are unavoidably doomed to wretch∣edness,
if any thing on earth can be wretch∣ed,
notwithstanding her utmost exertions, as
well as her pious and exemplary conduct to
her children, who not insensible to her merit,
endeavour to soothe her sorrows by their ten∣der
regard and fond affections.</P>
<P>Alas! what can they do, they all seem to
look up to the poor mother for aid, who I as
it not in her power even to help herself. She
now takes a serious retrospect of her past <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie,
and the mode of education in which herself and
children have been trained, and most ardently
does she wish they had been reared with indus∣try
at least, instead of all those bright accom∣plishments,
which must unavoidably be lost in
their misfortunes. But, since there is no recall∣ing
past time, their only redress is, to try to get
into some situation where their endea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and
exertions, at least, will make up the deficiency
of their want of knowledge. What, but such
<PB N="107" REF="107"/>
distress as this, and the want of a proper edu∣cation,
<HI>or trade,</HI> is it which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill the papers
daily with wants of every kind? "Wants a
situation to superintend;" or, "A person who
has seen better days, would be glad to under∣take;" or, "Wants a situation, as companion
or assistant, &amp;c.;" little supposing how frequent∣ly
these advertisements get answered by that ar∣rogant
set of mortals we before spoke of, with
the common phrase of, "I want no gentle∣women,
or gentlewomen's daughters;" and
although this assertion may found harsh to the
ears of the humane and sympathising part of
the community, be assured, this and such like
unfeeling cruelty is exercised over the unfor∣tunate,
even by their own sex, and those whose
professed feelings are so sine, as to shed tears
over a novel, or saint at the rehearsal of a tra∣gedy;
however, of these we hope the num∣ber
is small.—Seeing these women are ex∣cluded
all benefit in trade, what else can they
have recourse to, but to seek an asylum under
the roof of the asslu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, in some menial capa∣city?
which brings to my memory the con∣tents
of the tenth letter of the first Magdalen
<PB N="108" REF="108"/>
who was admitted into that most excellent
charity.</P>
<P>"I was reduced," says she, "to the mani∣fest
danger of starving. I would have at∣tempted
the most laborious work, but no one
would try me, although I offered my labour
at half price; but even my industry was made
an argument against me: I must, they said, be
very bad to be reduced to that, and they sup∣posed,
I intended to steal the other part of my
wages.</P>
<P>"To be willing and able to work, and yet
to starve for want of employment, seemed a hard
fate, yet it touched no heart but my own."</P>
<P>What a miserable prospect for helpless in∣nocence!
What a shocking case, that poor
unfortunate females should be denied the pri∣vilege
of obtaining a support by servitude, af∣ter
being precluded earning an honest mainte∣nance,
by any other means of industry, merely
to make way for a set of beings who are much
better calculated for more manly employments;
and, in particular, at a time when so many
men are required in defence of their country.
Besides, if there is not employment for the
<PB N="109" REF="109"/>
whole, and some must feel the inconvenien∣cies,
are not men much better calculated to
bear hardships than women? at least, is it not
always supposed and considered by men, that
women are not equal to any thing great, then
surely they may be permitted to fill some in∣ferior
department in life, whereby, at least,
they may be prevented from becoming bur∣densome,
or pining away for want of real ne∣cessaries?
And, however shocking to the sym∣pathising
part of mankind may be the recital
of these melancholy truths, yet the vast num∣bers
of poor unhappy mothers and daughters,
who are daily labouring under the weight of
these cruel oppressions are innumerable. Nor
is it possible for words to express, or pen to
paint, the grief of one of these unhappy mo∣thers,
who, with her helpless children, is re∣duced
to such extreme misery and want: can
any thing be more distressful or pitiable!</P>
<P>O, that men would be wise unto salvation,
and not prefer fordid gain to the more sub∣stantial
happiness of conforming to the pre∣cepts
of the Supreme Judge, who cannot de∣ceive
nor be deceived! namely "Whosoever
<PB N="110" REF="110"/>
shall offend one of these little ones that believe
in me, it is better for him that a millstone wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hanged about his neck, and he were cast int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the sea." A sentence one cannot think upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
without horror, seeing so many little one
offended daily and hourly, and left helples<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and forlorn in all the storms and trials of the
world, to work their passage through morta∣lity,
still floating about, like a bubble upon
the surface, in all the delicacy and softness of
their sex, without money, friend, or prospect
of any human comfort, or even relief, to en∣able
them to drag on a miserable existence the
ensuing day; surely, there is not any thing
can equal the horrors of a state like this: yet
what numbers experience it all, before they
will condescend so low as to shrink from the
paths of virtue. Surely this does not men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
censure: yet, astonishing it is, the smallest
feature of poverty is almost sure to be branded
with the names of infamy and vice. What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
trying situation after a life of affluence! yet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
where is the mind of sensibility, under such
circumstances as these, who would not feel it
almost as great an affliction to discover their
<PB N="111" REF="111"/>
poverty as to sustain it; for, thus miserably
situated, to have any of their former acquaint∣ance
witness their wretchedness, must be a
very trying circumstance indeed, and espe∣cially
since, by woeful experience, they are
taught to know that little more than censure
will be derived from it.</P>
<P>Indeed, amidst the great variety of compli∣cated
ills which are attendant upon all man∣kind,
and from which not any are exempt,
there will appear several in the world, the ori∣gin
of whose woe is scarcely to be traced; and
who, as a much admired author (Dr. Gregory)
observes, will find none to compassionate, or
even understand their sufferings: witness
amongst the prodigious numbers of unhappy
females in the married state, whom the adver∣sity
of fate has left alone to wander through
all this labyrinth of difficulties, and, perhaps,
surrounded by a numerous train of children,
who alike must feel the supercilious sneers of
taunt and reprobation, for they know not
what. Indeed, this subject would alone open
a very wide and dreary field to range in, so
various and complicated are the calamities
<PB N="112" REF="112"/>
brought upon mortals by the unseen hand of
fate, to which all must submit, since it is not
in the power of human skill to prevent: but
all must allow, it is in the power of any one
to moderate these afflictions by our best aid,
or sympathy at least, instead of heightening the
sorrows of this unfortunate and oppressed part
of the community, and with that well-known
philanthropist, <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> may we say, and
firmly believe,
<Q><L>"Every want that stimulates the breast,</L>
<L>"Becomes a source of pleasure when redress'd:"</L></Q>
for what can add greater pleasure to the sen∣sations
of humanity, than to sympathise with
the distressed? consequently to them I need not
address this discourse, but chiefly to tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
whose feelings are less warmed by the misery
of their fellow creatures, for a mixture of both
sorts there is in the world, is beyond a doubt.
Witness a paragraph I have this day, the 17th
of August 1798, copied from a well-known
daily paper, the Morning Herald, which runs
exactly as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="113" REF="113"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Editor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My friend and self, a few days ago, hav∣ing
dined with an officer at his barracks, re∣turned
home between ten and eleven: in
Panton-street we were accosted by an unfortu∣nate
woman, who first solicited our charity in
English; but overhearing us, in our progress
speak French, she renewed her suit in that
language, probably thinking we might be fo∣reigners,
and therefore did not understand the
nature of her first application. You will own,
it is by no means astonishing, that hearing an
English mendicant, <HI>especially a female,</HI> beg in
different languages should excite our admira∣tion,
particularly as she spoke both fluently and
elegantly, the evident result of a liberal educa∣tion.</P>
<P>Under this idea, we listened to her petition
delivered in French, which, being now so
common an acquisition, made us desirous of
knowing whether her learning was confined to
that tongue only; my friend, therefore, re∣plied
to her in Italian, and we were not a lit∣tle
surprised to find her not only mistress of
that language, but also well versed in Latin.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="114"/>
Shocked to discover such extensive learn∣ing
in one who seemed to profit so little by its
possession, and conceiving her an object of the
greatest pity, probably abandoned by unfeel∣ing,
sordid relations, we delayed not instantly
affording her some temporary relief; but in
the moment of so doing, I was so unfortunate
as to be recognized by my parents, who were
returning from a friend's house, where they
had supped. In such a place, at such an hour,
and with a female, what could be thought?
We were immediately adjudged criminal;
and, upon our joining them, were accordingly
reproached, as if their suspicions had been
true. Such is the power of prejudice, that
it was in vain we protested our innocence, in
vain we informed them of the nature of our
conversation with this woman; these availed
us nothing: we were not only censured for the
immorality of the affair itself, but also despised
for the meanness and vulgarity of our taste.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, what tends to confirm
them in this their premature opinion, is the
circumstance of my friend's stepping aside im∣mediately,
on perceiving their approach. But
<PB N="115" REF="115"/>
how easy is that accounted for? in such a situ∣ation,
where all direct proof of the innocence
of the individual is, by the peculiar nature of
the circumstance, excluded, what avails, ex∣cept
to yourself, the cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious rectitude of the
heart.</P>
<P><HI>Mens sibi conscia recti?</HI> It is impossible
to impart to others the internal feelings, ex∣cept
by words; and when people are prede∣termined
to disbelieve every syllable you urge
in your own justification, how are you to ef∣fect
your own exculpation? This action,
therefore, of my friend is by no means a con∣firmation
of our guilt, as it was extremely na∣tural,
that he should with to avoid being seen
in such a situation, in which appearances were
so much against him. His motives being
now explained, I beg leave for once to differ
from that proverb, that <HI>Innocence hath nothing
to fear.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c. W. R.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>A striking proof indeed, in addition to the
many, that <HI>unprotected</HI> innocence has <HI>every
<PB N="116" REF="116"/>
human</HI> thing to fear. But whose conduct of
the four, think ye, was the most commend∣able,
or pleasing in the fight of God or man?</P>
<P>Supposing, or even admitting, this poor
unfortunate woman to be one of the wretched
tribe, of whom we have been speaking. is it
not evident, her education was not calculated
either for beggary or vice? Nor can it be
supposed, from the distress which always
seems attendant upon this abject state of beg∣gary
alone, that it can be by choice preferred
to some laudable and reputable employment.
No: it is not in nature.</P>
<P>Then, in the name of reason, justice, and
truth, permit me to ask, from whence origi∣nates,
and what is it that countenances, the
cause of all these evils? Are they incurable?
Are not women, by nature, of a more gentle
and delicate composition than men, and less
able to bear the hardships which so frequent∣ly
are forced upon them? Has it not, in
all ages, been the task, or rather the avowed
choice, of the male part of the creation, to
protect and defend the weaker sex? and is not
the male part of the creation better able to
<PB N="117" REF="117"/>
bear cold, hunger, fatigue, and hardships than
women are? Poor helpless women! who no
sooner meet the heavy fate of indigence, than,
from their appearance, they are bound to sup∣port
a load of infamous censure along with it.</P>
<P>Although, at the same time, permit me to
infer, there is not the least necessity for men to
undergo the smallest part of these handships,
even bad they relinquished their claim to wo∣men's
occupations, since there is such a num∣ber
of branches in trade, beside arts and sci∣ences,
which are only calculated for men.
Surely, then, women ought to be permitted to
occupy the remaining few, nor any longer
suffered to be bound down by these oppres∣sive
chains; for, does not generous Pity de∣mand
a hearing in their behalf? Does not
common decency forbid they should be insult∣ed
in the manner they are? Is it manly, is it
noble, is it generous, or humane? Would
not one think, from such oppressions, that
men had determined to exert themselves for
the misery and torture of their fellow-crea∣tures.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="118"/>
I allow this kind of reasoning, to the inte∣rested
parties, may sound rather grating to the
ear: but, be it remembered, I have not under∣taken
the task of panegyric, but plain truth,
which needs no high-slown language to ex∣press
it: nor have I a wish to make an invidious
remark upon the conduct or behaviour of any
man, and much less to include a whole body
of them▪ But what success in trade, if such
they have, can make the smallest atonement,
on a death-bed, or come nearly adequate to
the loss of a poor soul, whom they may have
been the means of casting into the utmost mi∣sery
and distress, and forcing to seek an asylum
in the jaws of perdition? Would but a mind,
capable of the smallest feelings of humanity,
reflect on the many sacrifices made to this vo∣luptuous
avarice, and, in time, spare them∣selves
that pungent remorse due to such severe
reflections.</P>
<P>But, says the reasonable enquirer, with re∣gard
to suppressing this ancient custom, which
is pointed out as productive o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so much evil,
supposing an expedient is found out, will it
not be attended with such a number of incon∣veniencies,
<PB N="119" REF="119"/>
as thereby to render the remedy as
bad as the disease. To which I beg leave to
reply: I do not presume to instruct the learn∣ed,
but simply to communicate my ideas; for,
a complicated business like this, which has
taken so deep root, requires a greater know∣ledge
in human affairs to discuss than the
writer is possessed of; and a general know∣ledge
of the causes which facilitate or ob∣struct
the happiness of the community is ab∣soloutely
requisite, which discovers the many
convincing reasons why a business of so much
consequence should be properly investigated;
and, upon these considerations, as all things,
whether great or small, must have a beginning,
I have taken some pains to be informed as to
the nature of the subject. But as it is not ex∣pected
a female can have much knowledge in
judicature, I go upon the grounds of common
sense and reason, and not actuated by any
other motive than a wish to see happiness pre∣vail,
I shall accordingly beg leave to proceed
to the following considerations; for, as in the
estimation and choice of things, it is always
granted we are to prefer better to worse, and
<PB N="120" REF="120"/>
such things as are grounded in reason, to
others that hold no comparison therewith:
we will, therefore, suppose the very worst sup∣position
on which the argument can be found∣ed,
which is, What are this body of men to
do, or how are they to be disposed of, if de∣prived
of their present employment? Which
may be briefly answered:</P>
<P>That although there may be some men, like
women, of a timorous disposition, and thereby
may experience some inconveniencies, yet it is
not possible the whole body of them can suf∣fer,
by reason that, as I before observed, men
can turn themselves so many ways in the
world, which, were a woman to attempt, she
would be pointed at as ridiculous and frantic:
independent of which, after having stated the
heavy grievances under which, not only the female
part of the creation are oppressed, but the
community in general, it may justly be replied,
that no man, or body of men can, in reason,
lay claim to a privilege that is absolutely re∣pugnant
to all civil society: after which, will
not all other reasons appear to have little
weight? In other cases, has it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad any weight
<PB N="121" REF="121"/>
with the police of the country? How many
repeated instances have we seen of men, and
even bodies of men, who, by certain obliga∣tions,
have been obliged to give up public or
private property, when a general good could
not be otherwise obtained?</P>
<P>Then, why is there any distinction to be
made between relinquishing property and pri∣vilege,
when the public good requires it,
which in all exigencies must confessedly be
just? for, if change of circumstances were to
have no weight with the legislature in direct∣ing
human affairs, what would the intercourse
of mankind end in, but contention between
private interest and public good? But so long
as we are blessed with a happy constitution,
and rulers possessing humanity united with
wisdom, what have we to fear?</P>
<P>Were the desire of procuring liberty or hap∣piness
for this, or any other set of people, at
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>azard of injuring the community, or any
part of it, the request would not only be un∣reasonable
but unjust: but after summing up,
under each respective head, all the evidences
I have collected, with a very gentle hint at the
<PB N="122" REF="122"/>
enormous expence, as well as danger, and
other inconveniencies attending a continuance
of this precedent, and considering the many
great advantages which would accrue, not only
to the community, but to themselves, by en∣gaging
in more manly employments, I shall
leave the impartial reader to draw the conclu∣sion,
and rest the basis of my observatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
with those in power, for there are few, if any,
precedents of arbitrary commitments, except
the one in question, which have not come un∣der
the watchful eye of the legislature, whose
vigilance and impartiality have, at all times,
been a strong barrier and shield against any in∣fringements
upon the rights and privileges of
the British nation; and, I presume, an investi∣gation
into the grievances of these poor suf∣fering
females will quickly be a means of
doing away the precedent of encouraging, or
countenancing, effeminate tradesmen, which, it
is evident, are not only the origin of such un∣heard
of distresses to poor helpless females,
and preventing parents, who may be desirous
of breaking through the fashions of the
times, from placing their daughters to trades,
<PB N="123" REF="123"/>
but is absolutely leading to the dissolution of
all good government.</P>
<P>Nor is there the smallest danger, when once
the business is commenced, that the deep pe∣netration
and humanity of the guardians of the
common weal will ever be baffled in so lauda∣ble
a pursuit. For, notwithstanding the sub∣tlety
of the enemy of mankind may invent a
number of false and artful reasonings, yet
what will all that avail, when the curtain is
drawn aside, for then the spirit of justice and
retribution is to be no longer appeased by
such artifice; for neither law nor equity will
admit of mending their fortunes by fraud or
violence. And, although some of the offen∣sive
body may endeavour, by little artful chi∣can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry,
to gloss over their crimes, and endea∣vour
to palliate them with idle excuses, yet
the only real plea these oppressive traders can
make, being that of private interest, as I be∣fore
observed, it has at all times been judici∣ously
ordered to be given up for a public good.</P>
<P>What can possibly be deemed a more effi∣cacious
good, than to relieve the oppressed,
and preserve so many poor miserable souls
<PB N="124" REF="124"/>
from perdition. Yet it is greatly to be feared
these considerations to men, who are grown
torpid by custom, or blind by ignorance, will
give but little room for reflection.</P>
<P>Have we not every reason to believe, to the
disgrace of such part of the community as
call themselves Christians, that there are some,
though we will hope but a small part, whose
hearts are too much contracted and bound
down by avarice, to admit of any humane sen∣sations,
which, in a quarter of the globe,
where the refinements of the age are cried up
by all nations, is unaccountably strange; for,
in a scrupulous search for facts, which con∣firms
the writer's opinion on this subject, cer∣tain
it is, there is not a single page in the New
Testament which does not explicitly, or on
the fairest inference, condemn such conduct,
either by the example or precepts of Christ
and his apostles.</P>
<P>Then, since these men have become apostates
from Christianity, why any longer suffer their
arbitrary power to be a subterfuge for fraud
and oppression? Let the falutary laws of
Great Britain provide means for suppressing
<PB N="125" REF="125"/>
a precedent, which, through time and unfore∣seen
events, has become productive of so
much mischief. Or let them appear and
shew cause, why they are entitled to oppress
these poor women, in order to enjoy indo∣lence
and ease. And let their claims to the
flagrant violation of the rights of our fair
countrywomen be developed.</P>
<P>Although, at the same time, permit me to
infer, I cannot flatter myself these modes of
proceeding are expected entirely to eradicate
the sin against the seventh commandment.
But, from the prodigious numbers, which are
by compulsion driven to the paths of wicked∣ness,
will it not be a means of saving thou∣sands
of miserable creatures from sin and sor∣row,
and enable magistrates, and men in pow∣er,
to exercise justice and authority over the
wicked, without fear of punishing the innocent
with the guilty? for, believe me, it is not the
incorrigible sinner I take upon me to commi∣serate,
but the encouraged, or rather the com∣pelled,
sinner; and still more those who suffer
in innocence, which is the hapless, wretched
fate of thousands. And although I cannot recal
<PB N="126" REF="126"/>
to my memory the trifling observations I have
made on this occasion, I am conscious they are
my real sentiments; and flatter myself, however
bad the composition, the design will be adopt∣ed
by the generous and humane; when there is
not a doubt, but the heavy burden, which these
children of misery have so long supported,
will quickly be thrown off, and the stumbling
block to virtue and happiness be rolled away.</P>
<P>Have we not had sufficient proofs, that the
happiness and welfare of mortals have at all
times been thought worthy the attention of
a Briton. Witness the poor slaves; wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
exertions have not been used by the humane
friends of liberty in their behalf? Yet less,
much less, are their sufferings to be lamented
than the poor females I speak of, who have
been bred up and educated in the school of
Christianity, and fostered by the tender hand
of Care.</P>
<P>The slave is little acquainted with the se∣vere
pangs a virtuous mind labours under,
when driven to the extreme necessity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣feiting
their virtue for bread. The slave can∣not
feel pain at the loss of reputation, a term of
<PB N="127" REF="127"/>
which they never heard, and much less know
the meaning. What are the untutored, wild
imaginations of a slave, when put in the balance
with the distressing sensations of a British fe∣male,
who has received a refined, if not a
classical, education, and is capable of the finest
feelings the human heart is susceptible of. A
slave, through want of education, has little
more refinement than cattle in the field; nor
can they know the want of what they never
enjoyed, or were taught to expect; but a poor
female, who has received the best instruction,
and is endowed with a good understanding,
what must not she feel in mind, independent
of her corporeal wants, after the adversity of
fate has set her up as a mark, for the ridicule,
the censure, and contempt of the world?
Her feelings cannot be described, nor her suf∣ferings
sufficiently lamented.</P>
<P>I recollect some observations, made some
years ago, by a late honourable, humane,
learned, and truly worthy member of the
House of Commons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke.</NOTE>, respecting the business
<PB N="128" REF="128"/>
of the slave-trade, which doubly confirms my
opinion of the great necessity there is for an
investigation into the grievances I have been
speaking of, since it leads to a clear demon∣stration,
that the most judicious and benevo∣lent
may still remain in the dark, as to the suf∣ferings
of our Christian slaves at home.</P>
<P>"There is," said the honourable gentle∣man,
"no state in human nature but had its
compensations. What was a slave? a happy
slave was a degraded man; his happiness con∣sisted
in having no thought of the past, or the
future, and this deficiency of mind it was
which lessened the dignity of man, and con∣serred
happiness on the African."</P>
<P>A very striking and just observation, with
regard to the African, it must be granted; yet
I cannot but differ in opinion, when it is said,
that all mankind are capable of a compensa∣tion.
For, admitting the same mode of rea∣soning
to stand good, if the oppressions of one
part of the creation are moderated through
their ignorance, how much must the other be
heightened by their sensibility and the refine∣ments
of education. Nor can I see the small∣est
<PB N="129" REF="129"/>
trait of compensation remaining for these
miserable females, since the very education
they have received in youth, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds to
their misfortunes in maturity.</P>
<P>Then, if an investigation into the business of
the slave-trade has been sounded on such hu∣mane
and generous principles, how much
greater pleasure must it give the feeling heart,
to patronize the poor, unfortunate women of
our own nation, who labour under the very
worst kind of slavery, and must continue to
languish under the fetters of a painful bondage,
till death, or the kindly hand of interference,
has severed the chain?</P>
<P>But the justice of retribution taking place,
shall we not see these poor, helpless, and for∣lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
women set on a level with their fellow∣creatures,
and not be under the shocking and
cruel necessity of starving in a land of plenty?
And when the face of sorrow is enlivened with
the smile of happiness and content, and the
weary tradesman can lie down in peace, with∣out
fear or danger of being annoyed, by the
lawless plunderer; when all are united in the
bands of mutual benefit and preservation, and
<PB N="130" REF="130"/>
the memory of former woes is lost in the
blessings of a future age; it is then we may
reasonably expect, that less than half the im∣mense
sums which are now required, will be
sufficient to encourage honest industry.</P>
<P>But to detail the extent of human woes in
so small a compass is impossible, so various
and so fluctuating are the events of human
life, and its ills so numerous: so many sud∣den
deaths, losses in trade, and other casual∣ties
daily happen within our knowledge, the
bare recital of which is not only painful to
the narrator, but revives the melancholy tale
of woe in the ears of the suffering parties;
therefore, as the fate of an unknown indivi∣dual
seems so much on a par with the rest of
mankind, permit the foregoing pages to suf∣fice;
and, instead of adding the distressing his∣tory
of the unfortunate Mrs—, the writer
begs leave to introduce the story of Fidelia,
which being picturesque, and well adapted to
the design, by permission, may serve as a kind
of back-ground to the piece, without wound∣ing
again the heart of sensibility, by the reci∣tal
of past misfortunes.</P>

<P>SAYS FIDELIA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The story of Fidelia made its first appearance in the Adventurer, No. 77, 78, 79.</NOTE>, I shall make no apo∣logy
for the trouble I am about to give you,
since I am sure the motives that induce me to
give it will have as much weight with you as
they have with me; I shall, therefore, without
farther preface, relate to you the events of a
life, which, however insignificant and unen∣tertaining,
affords a lesson of the highest im∣portance;
a lesson, the value of which I have
experienced, and may therefore recommend.</P>
<P>I am the daughter of a gentleman of good
family, who, as he was a younger brother,
purchased, with the portion that was allot∣ted
him, a genteel post under government.
My mother died when I was but twelve years
<PB N="132" REF="132"/>
old, and my father, who was excessively fond
of me, determined to be himself my preceptor,
and to take care that my natural genius, which
his partiality made him think above the com∣mon
rank, should not want the improvements
of a liberal education.</P>
<P>He was a man of sense, with a tolerable
share of learning. In his youth he had been
a free liver, and, perhaps, for that reason took
some pains to become a free thinker. But
whatever fashionable frailties he might former∣ly
have allowed in himself, he was now in ad∣vanced
life, and had, at least, worldly wisdom
enough to know, that it was necessary his
daughter should be restrained from those liber∣ties,
which he had looked upon as trifling
errors in his own conduct. He therefore la∣boured
with great application to inculcate in
me the love of order, the beauty of moral recti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ule,
and the happiness and self-reward of
virtue; but, at the same time, professed it his
design to free my mind from vulgar prejudices
and superstition, for so he called revealed re∣ligion.
As I was urged to chuse virtue and
reject vice, from motives which had no neces∣sary
<PB N="133" REF="133"/>
connection with immortality. I was not
led to consider a future state either with hope
or fear. My father, indeed, when I urged
him upon that subject, always intimated that
the doctrine of immortality, whether true or
false, ought not at all to influence my con∣duct,
or interrupt my peace, because the vir∣tue
which secured happiness in the present
state, would also secure it in a future state: a
future state, therefore, I wholly disregarded,
and, to confess the truth, disbelieved: for I
thought I could plainly discover, that it was
disbelieved by my father, though he had not
thought fit explicitly to declare his sentiments.
As I had no very turbulent passions, a ductile
and good disposition, and the highest reverence
for his understanding, as well as the tenderest
affection for him, he found it an easy talk to
make me adopt every sentiment and opinion
which he proposed to me, as his own, espe∣cially
as he took care to support his principles
by the authority and arguments of the best
writers against Christianity.</P>
<P>At the age of twenty, I was called upon to
make use of all the philosophy I had been
<PB N="134" REF="134"/>
taught, by his death; which not only deprived
me of a parent I most ardently loved, but
with him of all the ease and affluence to
which I had been accustomed. His income
was only for life, and he had rather lived be∣yond
than within it; consequently, there was
nothing left for me, but the pride and help∣lessness
of genteel life, a taste for every thing
elegant, and a delicacy and sensibility that has
doubled my sufferings. In this distress, a
brother of my mother's, who was grown rich
in trade, received me into his house, and de∣clared
he would take the same care of me as if
I had been his own. When the first transports
of my grief were abated, I found myself in an
easy situation, and from the natural cheerful∣ness
of my temper, I was beginning once
more to taste of happiness. My uncle, who
was a man of narrow understanding and illibe∣ral
education, was a little disgusted with me
for employing so much of my time in read∣ing;
but still more so, when happening to
examine my books, he found, by the titles,
that some of them were what he called blas∣phemy,
and tended, as he imagined, to make me
<PB N="135" REF="135"/>
me an atheist. I endeavoured to explain my
principles, which I thought beneath the dig∣nity
of virtue to disguise or disavow; but
as I never could make him conceive any dif∣ference
between a deist and an atheist, my ar∣guments
only served to confirm him in the
opinion, that I was a wicked wretch, who, in
his own phrase, believed neither God nor de∣vil,
As he was really a good man, and hear∣tily
zealous for the established faith, though
more from habit and prejudice than reason,
my errors gave him great affliction. I per∣ceived
it with the utmost concern; I perceiv∣ed
too, that he looked upon me with a degree
of abhorrence mixed with pity, and that I was
wholly indebted to his good nature for that
protection, which I had flattered myself I
should owe to his love. I comforted myself,
however, with my own integrity, and even
felt a conscious pride, in suffering this perse∣cution
from ignorance and folly, only because
I was superior to vulgar errors and popular
superstition. And that Christianity deserved
these appellations, I was not more convinced
by my father's arguments, than my uncle's
<PB N="136" REF="136"/>
conduct, who, as his zeal was not according
to knowledge, was by no means qualified to
"adorn the doctrine which he professed to be∣lieve."</P>
<P>I had lived a few months under the painful
sensibility of receiving continual benefits from
a person whose esteem and affection I had lost,
when my uncle one day come into my cham∣ber,
and after preparing me for some unex∣pected
good fortune, told me, he had just had
a proposal of marriage for me, from a man to
whom I could not possibly have any objec∣tion.
He then named a merchant with whom
I had often been in company at his table. As
the man was neither old nor ugly, had a large
fortune, and a fair character, my uncle
thought himself sufficiently authorised to pro∣nounce
as he did, that I could not possibly
have any objection to him. An objection,
however, I had, which I told my uncle was
to me insuperable; it was, that the person
whom he proposed to me as the companion,
the guide, and director of my whole life, to
whom I was to vow, not only obedience, but
love, had nothing in him that could ever en∣gage
<PB N="137" REF="137"/>
my affection: his understanding was low,
his sentiments mean and indelicate, and his
manner unpolite and unpleasing. "What
stuff is all this?" interrupted my uncle, "sen∣timents
indelicate, unpolite, his understand∣ing
forsooth, not equal to your own! Ah!
child, if you had less romance, conceit, and
arrogance, and more true discretion and pru∣dence,
it would do you more good than all the
fine books you have confounded your poor
head with, and, what is worse, perhaps, ruin∣ed
your poor soul. I own it went a little
against my conscience to accept my honest
friend's kind offer, and give him such a pagan
for a wife. But I know not, whether the
believing husband may not convert the unbe∣lieving
wife? As to your slighty objections,
they are such nonsense, that I wonder you
can suppose me fool enough to be deceived
by them. No, child, wife as you are, you
cannot impose upon a man who has lived as
many years in the world as I have. I see your
motive; you have some in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idel libertine rake in
your eye, with whom you would go headlong
to perdition. But I shall take care to have
<PB N="138" REF="138"/>
your soul to answer for, as well as your per∣son.
Either I shall dispose of you to an honest
man that may convert you, or you shall dispose
of yourself how you please for me; for I dis∣claim
all farther care or trouble about you.
So I leave you to consider, whether or no the
kindness I have shewn you, entitles me to
some little influence over you, and whether
you chuse to seek protection where you can
find it, or accept of the happy lot Providence
has cut out for you."</P>
<P>He left me at the close of this fine harangue,
and I seriously set myself to consider, as he
bade me, which of the two states he had set
before me, I ought to chuse.—To submit to
a legal sort of prostitution, with the additional
weight of perjury on my conscience, or to
expose myself to all the distress of friendless
poverty and unprotected youth. After some
hours of deliberation, I determined on the
latter, and that more from principle than in∣clination;
for, though my delicacy would
have suffered extremely in accepting a hus∣band,
at least indifferent to me, yet as my
heart was perfectly disengaged, and my tem∣per
<PB N="139" REF="139"/>
naturally easy, I thought I could have
been less unhappy in following my uncle's
advice than I might probably be by rejecting
it. But then I must have submitted to an ac∣tion
I could not think justifiable, in order to
avoid mere external distresses. This would
not have been philosophical. I had always
been taught, that virtue was of itself sufficient
to happiness; and that those things which are
generally esteemed evils, could have no power
to disturb the felicity of a mind governed by
the eternal rule of right, and truly enamour∣ed
of the charms of moral beauty, I resolved,
therefore, to run all risques, rather than depart
from this glorious principle. I felt myself
raised by the trial, and exulted in the oppor∣tunity
of shewing my contempt of the smiles
or frowns of fortune, and of proving the
power of virtue to sustain the soul under all
accidental circumstances of distress.</P>
<P>I communicated my resolution to my uncle,
assuring him at the same time of my everlast∣ing
gratitude and respect, and that nothing
should have induced me to offend or disobey
him, but his requiring me to do what my reason
<PB N="140" REF="140"/>
and conscience disapproved; that supposing
the advantages of riches to be really as great as
he believed, yet still those of virtue were great∣er,
and I could not reslove to purchase the one
by a violation of the other; that a false vow was
certainly criminal; and that it would be doing
an act of the highest injustice, to enter into so
solemn an engagement without the power of
fulfilling it; that my affections did not de∣pend
on my own will; and that no man should
possess my person, who could not obtain the
first place in my heart.</P>
<P>I was surprised that my uncle's impatience
had permitted me to go on thus far; but look∣ing
in his face, I perceived that passion had kept
him silent. At length the gathering storm
burst over my head in a torrent of reproaches;
my reasons were condemned as romantic ab∣surdities,
which I could not myself believe.
I was accused of designing to deceive, and to
throw myself away on some worthless fellow,
whose principles were as bad as my own. It
was in vain for me to assert, that I had no such
design, nor any inclination to marry at all. My
uncle could sooner have believed the grossest
<PB N="141" REF="141"/>
contradiction, than that a young woman could
so strenuously refuse one man, without being
prepossessed in favour of another. As I
thought myself injured by his accusations and
tyranny, I gave over the attempt to mitigate
his anger. He appealed to Heaven for the
justice of his resentment, and against my in∣gratitude
and rebellion; and then giving me
a note of fifty pounds, which he said would
keep me from immediate indigence, he bade
me leave his house, and see his face no more.
I bowed in sign of obedience, and collecting
all my dignity and resolution, I arose, thanked
him for his past benefits, and, with a low
curtsey, left the room.</P>
<P>In less than an hour, I departed, with my
little wardrobe, to the house of a person who
had formerly been my father's servant, and
who now kept a shop and let lodgings. From
thence I went the next day to visit my father's
nephew, who was in possession of the family
estate, and had lately married a lady of great
fortune. He was a young gentleman of good
parts, his principles the same as my father's,
though his practice had not been quite
<PB N="142" REF="142"/>
agreeable to the strict rules of morality. How∣ever,
setting aside a few of those vices which
are looked upon as genteel accomplishments
in young fellows of fortune, I thought him a
good sort of man; and, as we had always liv∣ed
in great kindness, I doubted not that I
should find him my friend, and meet with ap∣probation
and encouragement, at least, if not
assistance, from him. I told him my story,
and the reasons that had determined me to the
refusal that had incurred my uncle's displea∣sure;
but how was I disappointed, when, in∣stead
of the applause I expected for my heroic
virtue and unmerited persecutions, I perceiv∣ed
a smile of contempt on his face, when he
interrupted me in the following manner:</P>
<P>"And what in the devil's name, my dear
cousin, could make a woman of your sense
behave so like an ideot? What! forfeit all
your hopes from your uncle, refuse an excel∣lent
match, and reduce yourself to beggary
because, truly, you were not in love? Surely
one might have expected better from you even
at fifteen. Who is it, pray, that marries the
person of their choice? For my own part, who
<PB N="143" REF="143"/>
have rather a better title to please myself,
with a good fifteen hundred a year, than you
who have not a shilling, I found it would not
do; and that there was something more to be
sought after in a wife, than a pretty face or a
genius. Do you think I cared three farthings
for the woman I married?—No, faith; but
her thirty thousand pounds were worth hav∣ing;
with that I can purchase a seraglio of
beauties, and indulge my taste in every kind
of pleasure. And, pray, what is it to me,
whether my wife has beauty, or wit, or ele∣gance,
when her money will supply me with
all that in others? You, cousin, had an op∣portunity
of being as happy as I am. The
men, believe me, would not like you a bit
the worse for being married; on the contrary,
you would find, that for one who took notice
of you as a single woman, twenty would be
your admirers and humble servants, when
there was no danger of being taken in: thus
you might have gratified all your passions,
made an elegant figure in life, and have cho∣sen
out some gentle swain, as romantic and
poetical as you pleased, for your cecisbeo.
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
The good John Trot husband would have
been easily managed."</P>
<P>My indignation could be contained no lon∣ger,
and I was leaving the room in disdain,
when he caught me by the hand. "Nay,
prithee, my dear cousin, none of these violent
airs: I thought you and I had known one ano∣ther
better. Let the poor souls who are taught
by the priests and their nurses to be afraid of
hell-fire, and to think they shall go to the de∣vil
for following nature, and making life agree∣able,
be as outrageously virtuous as they
please, you have too much sense to be fright∣ened
at bugbears. You know that the term
of our existence is but short, and it is highly
reasonable to make it as pleasant as possible."</P>
<P>I was too angry to attempt confusing his ar∣guments;
but, bursting from his hold, told
him, I would take care not to give him a se∣cond
opportunity of insulting my distress, and
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ronting my understanding; and so left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
house with a resolution never to enter it again.</P>
<P>I went home mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ified and disippointed;
my spirits sunk into a dejection which took
from me, for many days, all inclination to
<PB N="145" REF="145"/>
stir out of my lodging, or to see a human
face. At length I resolved to try whether in∣digence
and friendship were really incompati∣ble,
and whether I should meet with the same
treatment from a female friend, whose affec∣tion
had been the principal pleasure of my
youth. Surely, thought I, the gentle Aman∣da,
whose heart seems capable of every tender
and generous sentiment, will do justice to the
innocence and integrity of her unfortunate
friend; her tenderness will encourage my vir∣tue,
and animate my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her praises
and endearments will compensate all my hard∣ships.
Amanda was a single woman, of a
moderate independent fortune, which I heard
she was going to bestow on a young officer,
who had little or nothing besides his commis∣sion.
I had no doubt of her approbation of
my refusing a mercenary match, since she her∣self
had chosen from motives so opposite to
those which are called prudent. She had been
in the country some months, so that my mis∣fortunes
had not reached her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, till I myself
related them to her.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="146"/>
She heard me with great attention, and an∣swered
with politeness enough, but with a
coldness that chilled my very heart.</P>
<P>"You are sensible, my dear Fidelia," said
she, "that I never pretended to set my under∣standing
in competition with yours. I know
my own inferiority, and though many of your
notions and opinions appeared to me very
strange and particular, I never attempted to
dispute them with you. To be sure, you
know best: but it seems to me a very odd con∣duct,
for one in your situation to give offence
to so good an uncle; first, by maintaining
doctrines which may be very true for ought I
know, but which are very contrary to the re∣ceived
opinions we are brought up in, and
therefore are apt to shock a common under∣standing;
and secondly, to renounce his pro∣tection,
and throw yourself into the wide
world, rather than marry the man he chose
for you; to whom, after all, I do not find you
had any real objection, nor any antipathy for
his person."</P>
<P>"Antipathy, my dear," said I, "are there
not many degrees between loving and honour∣ing
<PB N="147" REF="147"/>
a man preferably to all others, and behold∣ing
him with abhorrence and aversion. The
first is, in my opinion, the duty of a wife, a
duty voluntarily taken upon herself, and en∣gaged
in under the most solemn contract. As
to the difficulties that may attend my friend∣less,
unprovided state, since they are the conse∣quences
of a virtuous action, they cannot real∣ly
be evils, nor can they disturb that happiness
which is the gift of virtue."—"I am heartily
glad," answered she, "that you have found out
the art of making yourself happy by the force
of imagination. I wish your enthusiasm may
continue, and that you may still be farther
convinced, by your own experience, of the
folly of mankind, in supposing poverty and
disgrace to be evils."</P>
<P>I was cut to the soul by the unkind manner
which accompanied this sarcasm, and was go∣ing
to remonstrate against her unfriendly treat∣ment,
when her lover came in, with another
gentleman, who, in spite of my full heart,
engaged my attention, and, for a while, made
me forget the stings of unkindness. The
beauty and gracefulness of his person caught
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
my eye, and the politeness of his address, and
the elegance of his compliments, soon preju∣diced
me in favour of his understanding. He
was introduced by the captain to Amanda as his
most intimate friend, and seemed desirous to
give credit to his friend's judgment, by making
himself as agreeable as possible. He succeed∣ed
so well, that Amanda was wholly engrossed
by the pleasure of his conversation, and the
care of entertaining her lover and her new
guest. Her face brightened and her good hu∣mour
returned. When I arose to leave her,
she pressed me so earnestly to stay dinner, that
I could not, without discovering how much I
resented her behaviour, refuse. This, how∣ever,
I should probably have done, as I was
naturally disposed to shew every sentiment of
my heart, had not a secret wish arisen there to
know a little more of this agreeable stranger.
This inclined me to think it prudent to con∣ceal
my resentment, and to accept the civili∣ties
of Amanda. The conversation grew more
and more pleasing; I took my share in it; and
had more than my share of the charming
stranger's notice and attention. As we all grew
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
more and more unreserved, Amanda dropped
hints in the course of the conversation relating
to my story, my sentiments, and unhappy situ∣ation.
Sir George Freelove, for that was the
young gentleman's name, listened greedily to
all that was said of me, and seemed to eye me
with an earnest curiosity, as well as admiration.
We did not part till it was late; and Sir
George insisted on attending me to my lodg∣ings.
I strongly refused it, not without a sen∣sation,
which more properly belonged to the
female than the philosopher, and which I con∣demned
in myself, as arising from dishonest
pride.</P>
<P>I could not, without pain, suffer the polite
Sir George, upon so short an acquaintance,
to discover the meanness of my abode. To
avoid this, I sent for a chair, but was confus∣ed
to find that Sir George and his servants
prepared to attend it on foot, by way of guard.
It was in vain to dispute: he himself walked
before, and his servants followed it. I was
covered with blushes, when, after all this pa∣rade,
he handed me in at the little shop door,
and took leave with as profound respect, as if
<PB N="150" REF="150"/>
he had guarded me into a palace. A thousand
different thoughts kept me from closing my
eyes that night. The behaviour of Amanda
wounded me to the soul: I found that I must
look on her as no more than a common ac∣quaintance,
and that the world did not con∣tain
one person whom I could call my friend.
My heart felt desolate and forlorn. I knew
not what course to take for my future subsist∣ence.
The pain which my pride had just
given me, convinced me that I was far from
having conquered the passions of humanity,
and that I should feel too sensibly all the mor∣tifications
which attend on poverty. I deter∣mined,
however, to subdue this pride, and call
to my assistance the example of ancient sages
and philosophers, who despised riches and ho∣nours,
and felt no inconveniencies from the
malice of fortune. I had almost reasoned my∣self
into a contempt for the world, and fan∣cied
myself superior to its smiles or frowns,
when the idea of Sir George Freelove rushed
upon my mind, and destroyed, at once, the
whole force of my reasoning. I found that,
however I might disregard the rest of the
<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
world, I could not be indiffernt to his opi∣nion;
and the thought of being despised by
him was insupportable. I recollected that my
condition was extremely different from that of
an old philosopher, whose rags, perhaps, were
the means of gratifying his pride, by attracting
the notice and respect of mankind: at least,
the philosopher's schemes and wishes were ve∣ry
different from those which, at that time,
were taking possession of my heart. The
looks and behaviour of Sir George, left me
no doubt, that I had made as deep an impres∣sion
in his favour as he had done in mine. I
could not bear to lose the ground I had gained,
and to throw myself into a state below his no∣tice.
I scorned the thought of imposing on
him with regard to my circumstances, in case
he should really have had favourable intentions
for me; yet to disgrace myself for ever in his
eye, by submitting to servitude, or any low
way of supporting myself, was what I could
not bring myself to resolve on.</P>
<P>In the midst of these reflections. I was sur∣prised,
the next morning, by a visit from Sir
George. He made respectful apologies for
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
the liberty he took; told me he had learned
from my friend, that the unkindness and ty∣ranny
of an uncle had cast me into uneasy cir∣cumstances;
and that he could not know that
so much beauty and merit were so unworthily
treated by fortune, without earnestly wishing
to be the instrument of doing me more justice.
He entreated me to add dignity and value to
his life, by making it conducive to the happi∣ness
of mine; and was going on with the most
fervent offers of service, when I interrupted
him, by saying that there was nothing in his
power that I could with honour accept, by
which my life could be made happier, but that
respect which was due to me as a woman and
a gentlewoman, and which ought to have pre∣vented
such offers of service from a stranger,
as could only be justified by a long-experi∣enced
friendship; that I was not in a situation
to receive visits, and must decline his ac∣quaintance,
which, nevertheless, in a happier
part of my life would have given me pleasure.</P>
<P>He now had recourse to all the arts of his
sex, imputing his too great freedom to the force
of his passion, protesting the most inviolable
<PB N="153" REF="153"/>
respect, and imploring on his knees, and even
with tears, that I would not punish him so se∣verely,
as to deny him the liberty of seeing
me, and making himself more and more wor∣thy
of my esteem. My weak heart was but
too much touched by his artifices, and I had
only just fortitude enough to persevere in re∣fusing
his visits, and to insist on his leaving
me, which at last he did; but with such a
profusion of tenderness, prayers, and protesta∣tions,
that it was some time before I could
recal my reason enough to reflect on the
whole of his behaviour, and on my own situ∣ation,
which compared, left me but little doubt
of his dishonourable views.</P>
<P>I determined never more to admit him to
my presence, and accordingly gave orders to
be denied, if he came again. My reason ap∣plauded,
but my heart reproached me, and
heavily repined at the rigid determination of
prudence. I knew that I acted rightly, and I
expected that that consciousness would make
me happy; but I found it otherwise, I was
wretched beyond what I had ever felt, or
formed any idea of. I discovered that my
<PB N="154" REF="154"/>
heart was entangled in a passion which must
for ever be combated, or indulged at the ex∣pence
of virtue. I now considered riches as
truly desirable, since they would have placed
me above disgraceful attempts, and given me
reasonable hopes of becoming the wife of Sir
George Freelove. I was discontented and un∣happy,
but surprised and disappointed to find
myself so, since hitherto I had no one crimi∣nal
action to reproach myself with; on the
contrary, my difficulties were all owing to my
regard for virtue.</P>
<P>I resolved, however, to try still farther the
power of virtue to confer happiness, to go on
in my obedience to her laws, and patient∣ly
wait the good effects of it. But I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
stronger difficulties to go through than any I
had yet experienced: Sir George was too
much practised in the arts of seduction to be
discouraged by a first repulse, every day pro∣duced
either some new attempt to see me, or
a letter full of the most passionate protesta∣tions
and entreaties for pardon and favour: it
was in vain I gave orders that no more letters
should be taken in from him: he had so many
<PB N="155" REF="155"/>
different contrivances to convey them, and
directed them in hands so unlike, that I was
surprised into reading them, contrary to my
intentions. Every time I stirred out, he was
sure to be in my way, and to employ the most
artful tongue that ever ensnared the heart of
woman, in blinding my reason and awakening
my passions.</P>
<P>My virtue, however, did not yet give way,
but my peace of mind was utterly destroyed.
Whenever I was with him, I summoned all
my fortitude, and constantly repeated my
commands, that he should avoid me: his dis∣obedience
called for my resentment, and, in
spite of my melting heart, I armed my eyes
with anger, and treated him with as much
disdain as I thought his unworthy designs
deserved. But the moment he left me, all
my resolution forsook me, I repined at my
fate, I even murmured against the Sove∣reign
Ruler of all things, for making me
subject to passions I could not subdue, yet
must not indulge. I compared my own situ∣ation
with that of my libertine cousin, whose
pernicious arguments I had heard with horror
<PB N="156" REF="156"/>
and detestation; who gave the reins to every
desire; whose house was the seat of plenty,
mirth, and delight; whose face was ever cover∣ed
with smiles; and whose heart seemed free
from sorrow and care. Is not this man, said I,
happier than I am? and if so, where is the
worth of virtue? Have I not sacrificed to her
my fortune and my friends? Do I not daily
sacrifice to her my darling inclination; yet,
what is the compensation she offers me?
What are my prospects in this world but
poverty, mortification, disappointment, and
grief? Every wish of my heart denied, every
passion of humanity combated and hurt, though
never conquered! Are these the blessings
with which Heaven distinguishes it favourites?
Can the King of Heaven want power or
will to distinguish them? or does he leave
his wretched creatures the sport of chance,
the prey of wickedness and malice? Surely
no. Yet is not the condition of the virtuous
often more miserable than that of the vicious?
I myself have experienced that it is. I am
very unhappy, and see no likelihood of my
being otherwise in this world—and all beyond
<PB N="157" REF="157"/>
the grave is eternal darkness. Yet why do I
say that I have no prospect of happiness? does
not the most engaging of men offer me all the
joys that love and fortune can bestow? Will
not he protect me from every insult of the
proud world that scoffs at indigence? Will
not his liberal hand pour forth the means of
every pleasure, even of that highest and truest
of all pleasure, the power of relieving the
sufferings of my fellow-creatures, of changing
the tears of distress into tears of joy and grati∣tude,
of communicating my own happiness to
all around me? Is not this a state far prefer∣able
to that in which virtue has placed me?
But what is virtue? Is not happiness the laud∣able
pursuit of reason? Is it not then laudable
to pursue it by the most probable means?
Have I not been accusing Providence of un∣kindness,
whilst I myself only am in fault for
rejecting its offered favours? Surely, I have
mistaken the path of virtue: it must be that
which leads to happiness. The path which I
am in is full of thorns and briars, and termi∣nates
in impenetrable darkness; but I see an∣other
that is strewed with flowers, and bright
<PB N="158" REF="158"/>
with the sun shine of prosperity: this, surely,
is the path of virtue and the road to happiness.
Hither then let me turn my weary steps, nor
let vain and idle prejudices fright me from fe∣licity.
It is surely impossible that I should
offend God, by yielding to a temptation which
he has given me no motive to resist. He has
allotted me a short and precarious existence,
and has placed before me good and evil. What
is good but pleasure? What is evil but pain?
Reason and nature direct me to chuse the first,
and avoid the last. I sought for happiness in
what is called virtue, but I found it not: shall
I not try the other experiment, since I think
I can hardly be more unhappy by following
inclination, than I am by denying it?</P>
<P>Thus had my frail thoughts wandered into
a wilderness of error, and thus had I almost
reasoned myself out of every principle of mo∣rality,
by pursuing, through all their conse∣quences,
the doctrines which had been taught
me as rules of life and prescriptions for felici∣ty,
the talisinans of truth, by which I should be
secured in the storms of adversity, and listen
without danger to the syrens of temptation;
<PB N="159" REF="159"/>
when, in the fatal hour of my presumption,
sitting alone in my chamber, collecting argu∣ments
on the side of passion, almost distracted
with doubts, and plunging deeper and deeper
into falsehood, I saw Sir George Freelove at
my feet, who had gained admittance, contrary
to my orders, by corrupting my landlady. It
is not necessary to describe to you his arts, or
the weak effects of that virtue which had been
graciously implanted in my heart, but which I
had taken impious means to undermine by false
reasoning, and which now tottered from the
foundation: sussice it that I submitted to the hu∣miliation
I have so well deserved, and tell you,
that, in the pride of human reason I dared to
condemn, as the effect of weakness and pre∣judice,
the still voice of conscience, which
would yet have warned me from ruin; that my
innocence, my honour was the sacrifice to
passion and sophistry; that my boasted philo∣sophy,
and too much slattered understanding,
preserved me not from the lowest depth of in∣samy,
which the weakest of my sex with hu∣mility
and religion would have avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160"/>
I now experienced a new kind of wretch∣edness:
my vile seducer tried in vain to re∣concile
me to the shameful life to which he
had reduced me, by loading me with finery,
and lavishing his fortune in procuring me plea∣sures
which I could not taste, and pomp which
seemed an insult on my disgrace. In vain did
I recollect the arguments which had convinc∣ed
me of the lawfulness of accepting offered
pleasures, and following the dictates of incli∣nation.
The light of my understanding was
darkened, but the sense of guilt was not lost:
my pride and my delicacy, if, criminal as I
was, I may dare to call it so, suffered the most
intolerable mortification and disgust every time
I reflected on my infamous situation. Every
eye seemed to upbraid me, even that of my
triumphant seducer. O depth of misery! to
be conscious of deserving the contempt of him
I loved, and for whose sake I was become
contemptible to myself.</P>
<P>This was the state of my mind during a
year which I passed in Sir George's house:
his fondness was unabated for eight months of
the time; and as I had no other object to
<PB N="161" REF="161"/>
share my attention, neither friend nor relation
to call off any part of my tenderness, all the
love of a heart naturally affectionate centered
in him. The first dawnings of unkindness were
but too visible to my watchful eyes. I had
now all the torments of jealousy to endure,
till a cruel certainty put an end to them; I
learnt, at length, that my false lover was on
the brink of marriage with a lady of great for∣tune.
I immediately resolved to leave him,
but could not do it without first venting my
full heart in complaints and reproaches. This
provoked his rage, and drew on me insolence,
which, though I had deserved, I had not
learnt to bear. I returned with scorn, which
no longer became me, all the wages of my sin,
and the trappings of my shame, and left his
house in the bitterest anguish of resentment
and despair.</P>
<P>I returned to my old lodgings; but unable to
bear a scene which recalled every circumstance
of my undoing, ashamed to look in the fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of any creature who had seen me innocent,
wretched in myself, and hoping from change
of place some abatement of my misery, I p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
<PB N="162" REF="162"/>
myself into a post-chaise at two in the morn∣ing,
with orders to the driver to carry me as
far from town as he could before the return of
night, leaving it to him to chuse the road.</P>
<P>My reason and my senses seemed benumbed
and stupified during my journey. I made no
reflections on what I was about, nor formed
any design for my future life. When night
came, my conductor would have stopped at a
large town, but I bid him go on to the next
village: there I alighted at a paltry inn, and
dismissed my vehicle, without once consider∣ing
what I was to do with myself, or why I
chose that place for my abode. To say truth,
I can give no account of my thoughts at this
period of time: they were all confused and
distracted. A short frenzy must have filled up
those hours, of which my memory retains such
imperfect traces. I remember only, that with∣out
having pulled off my clothes, I left the
inn as soon as I saw the day, and wandered
out of the village.</P>
<P>My unguided feet carried me to a range of
willows by a river's side, where, after having
walked some time, the freshness of the air re∣vived
<PB N="163" REF="163"/>
my senses, and awakened my reason.
My reason, my memory, my anguish, and de∣spair
returned together. Every circumstance
of my past life was present to my mind; but
most the idea of my faithless lover, and my
criminal love tortured my imagination and
rent my bleeding heart, which, in spite of all its
guilt and all its wrongs, retained the tenderest
and most ardent affection for its undo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. This
unguarded affection, which was the effect of a
gentle and kind nature, heightened the anguish
of resentment, and compleated my misery.
In vain did I call off my thoughts from this
gloomy retrospect, and hope to find a gleam of
comfort in my future prospects. They were
still more dreadful: poverty, attended by in∣famy,
and want groaning under the cruel hand
of oppression, and the taunts of insolence were
before my eyes. I, who had once been the
darling and the pride of indulgent parents,
who had once been beloved, respected, and
admired, was now the outcast of human na∣ture;
despised and avoided by all who had
ever loved me, by all whom I had most loved!
<PB N="164" REF="164"/>
hateful to myself, belonging to no one, ex∣posed
to wrongs and insults from all.</P>
<P>I tried to find out the cause of this dismal
change, and how far I was myself the occasion
of it. My conduct, with regard to Sir George,
though I spontaneously condemned, yet, upon
recollection, I thought the arguments which
produced it would justify. But as my prin∣ciples
could not preserve me from vice, nei∣ther
could they sustain me in adversity: con∣science
was not to be perverted by the sophis∣try
which had beclouded my reason. And if
any, by imputing my conduct to error, should
acquit me of guilt, let them remember, it is yet
true, that in this uttermost distress, I was nei∣ther
sustained by the consciousness of inno∣cence,
the exultation of virtue, nor the hope of
reward: whether I looked backward or for∣ward,
all was confusion and anguish, distraction
and despair. I accused the Supreme Being
of cruelty and injustice, who, though he gave
me not sufficient encouragement to resist de∣sire,
yet punishes me with the consequences
of indulgence. If there is a God, cried I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="165" REF="165"/>
he must be either tyrannical and cruel, or re∣gardless
of her creatures. I will no longer
endure a being which is undeservedly miser∣able,
either from chance or design, but fly to
that annihilation in which all my prospects
terminate. Take back, said I, listing my eyes
to Heaven, the hateful gift of existence, and
let my dust no more be animated to suffering,
and exalted to misery.</P>
<P>So saying, I ran to the brink of the river,
and was going to plunge in, when the cry of
some person very near me made me turn my
eyes to see whence it came. I was ac∣costed
by an elderly gentleman, who, with
looks of terror, pity, and benevolence, asked
what I was about to do? At first I was sullen,
and refused to answer him: but by degrees the
compassion he shewed, and the tenderness
with which he treated me, softened my heart,
and gave vent to my tears.</P>
<P>"O, Madam!" said he, "these are gracious
signs, and unlike those which first drew my
attention, and made me watch you unobserv∣ed,
fearing some fatal purpose in your mind.
What must be the thoughts which could make
<PB N="166" REF="166"/>
a face like yours appear the picture of horror?
I was taking my morning walk, and have seen
you a considerable time: sometimes stopping
and wringing your hands, sometimes quicken∣ing
your pace, and sometimes walking slow,
with your eyes fixed on the ground, till you
raised them to Heaven, with looks not of sup∣plication
and piety, but rather of accusation
and defiance. For pity tell me, how it is that
you have quarrelled with yourself, with life,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay even with Heaven? Recal your reason
and your hope, and let this seasonable preven∣tion
of your fatal purpose be an earnest to you
of good things to come, of God's mercy not
yet alienated from you, and stooping from his
throne to save your soul from perdition?"</P>
<P>The tears which flowed in rivers from my
eyes while he talked, gave me so much relief,
that I found myself able to speak, and desirous
to express my gratitude for the good man's
concern for me. It was so long since I had
known the joys of confidence, that I felt sur∣prising
pleasure and comfort from unbur∣dening
my heart, and telling my kind deli∣verer
every circumstance of my story, and
<PB N="167" REF="167"/>
every thought of my distracted mind. He
shuddered to hear me upbraid the Divine Pro∣vidence,
and stopping me short, told me he
would lead me to one who should preach pa∣tience
to me whilst she gave me the example
of it.</P>
<P>As we talked he lead me to his own house,
and there introduced me to his wife, a middle∣aged
woman, pale and emaciated, but of a
cheerful placid countenance, who received
me with the greatest tenderness and humanity.
She saw I was distressed, and her compassion
was before hand with my complaints. Her
tears stood ready to accompany mine; her
looks and her voice expressed the kindest con∣cern;
and her assiduous cares demonstrated that
true politeness and hospitality, which is not
the effect of art but of inward benevolence.
While she obliged me to take some refresh∣ment,
her husband gave her a short account of
my story, and of the state in which he found
me. "This poor lady," said he, "from the
fault of her education and principles, sees
every thing through a gloomy medium. She
accuses Providence, and hates her existence
<PB N="168" REF="168"/>
for those evils which are the common lot of
mankind in this short state of trial. You, my
dear, who are one of the greatest sufferers I
have known, are best qualified to cure her of
her faulty impatience, and to convince her, by
your own example, that this world is not the
place in which virtue is to find its reward.
She thinks no one so unhappy as herself; but
i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she knew all that you have gone through,
she would surely be sensible, that if you are
happier than she, it is only because your prin∣ciples
are better."</P>
<P>"Indeed, my dear madam!" said she,
"that is the only advantage that I have over
you; but that indeed out weighs every thing
else. It is now but ten days since I followed
to the grave my only son, the survivor of eight
children, who were all equally the objects of
my fondest love: my heart is no less tender
than your own, nor my affections less warm.
For a whole year before the death of my last
darling, I watched the fatal progress of his dis∣ease,
and saw him suffer the most amazing
pains. Nor was poverty, that dreaded evil, to
which you could not submit, wanting to my
<PB N="169" REF="169"/>
trials: though my husband is, by his profes∣sion,
a gentleman, his income is so small, that
I and my children have often wanted necessa∣ries:
and though I had always a weakly con∣stitution,
I have helped to support my family
by the labour of my own hands At this time
I am consuming, by daily tortures, with a can∣cer,
which must shortly be my death. My
pains, perhaps, might be mitigated by proper
assistance, though nothing could preserve my
life; but I have not the means to obtain that
assistance." O, hold! interrupted I, my soul
is shocked at the enumeration of such intoler∣able
sufferings: how is it that you support
them? Why do I not see you, in despair like
mine, renounce your existence, and put your∣self
out of the reach of torment? But, above
all, tell me how it is possible for you to pre∣serve,
amidst such complicated misery, that
appearance of cheerfulness and serene com∣placency
which shines so remarkably in your
countenance, and animates every look and
motion.</P>
<P>"That cheerfulness and complacency," an∣swered
the good woman, "I feel in my heart.
<PB N="70" REF="170"/>
My mind is not only serene, but often experi∣ences
the highest emotions of joy and exulta∣tion,
that the brightest hopes can give." And
whence, said I, do you derive this astonishing
art of extracting joy from misery, and of smil∣ing
amidst all the terrors of pain, sorrow, po∣verty,
and death? She was silent for a moment,
then stepping to her closet, reached a Bible,
which she put into my hands: "See there,"
said she, "the volume in which I have learnt
this art. Here I am taught, that everlasting
glory is in store for all who will accept it
upon the terms which Infinite Perfection has
prescribed; here I am promised consolation,
assistance, and support from the Lord of Life;
and here I am assured, that my transient af∣flictions
are only meant to fit me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eternal
and unspeakable happiness. This happiness is
at hand. The short remainder of my life
seems but a point, beyond which opens the
glorious prospect of immortality: thus encou∣raged,
how should I be dejected? Thus sup∣ported,
how should I sink? With such pro∣spects,
such assured hopes, how can I be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther∣ways
than happy?"</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="171"/>
While she spoke, her eyes sparkled, and her
whole face seemed animated with joy. I was
struck with her manner, as well as her words.
Every syllable she uttered seemed to sink into
my soul, so that I never can forget it. I
resolved to examine a religion, which was
capable of producing such effects as I could
not attribute either to chance or error. The
good couple pressed me, with so much unaf∣fected
kindness, to make their little parsonage
my asylum till I could better dispose of my∣self,
that I accepted their offer. Here, with
the assistance of the clergyman, who is a plain,
sensible, and truly pious man, I have studied
the Holy Scriptures, and the evidences of
their authority. But after reading them with
candour and attention, I found all the intrin∣sic
arguments of their truth superfluous: the
excellency of their precepts, the consistency
of their doctrines, and the glorious motives
and encouragements to virtue which they pro∣pose;
together with the striking example I
had before my eyes of their salutary effects,
left me no doubt of their divine authority.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="172"/>
During the time of my abode here, I have
been witness to the more than heroic, the joy∣ful,
the triumphant death of the dear good wo∣man.
With as much softness and tenderness as
I ever saw in a female character, she shewed
more dauntless intrepidity than the sternest
philosopher, or the proudest hero. No tor∣ment
could shake the constancy of her soul,
or length of pain wear out the strength of her
patience. Death was to her an object not of
horror but of hope. When I heard her pour
forth her last breath in thanksgiving, and saw
the smile of extasy remain on her pale face
when life was fled, I could not help crying
out in the beautiful language I had lately
learnt from the Sacred Writings, "O Death!
where is thy sting? O Grave! where is thy
victory?"</P>
<P>I am now preparing to leave my excellent
benefactor, and get my bread in a service, to
which he has recommended me in a neigh∣bouring
family. A state of servitude, to
which once I could not resolve to yield, ap∣pears
no longer dreadful to me; that pride,
which would have made it galling, Christianity
<PB N="173" REF="173"/>
has subdued, though philosophy attempted it in
vain. As a penitent, I should gratefully sub∣mit
to mortification; but as a Christian, I find
myself superior to every mortification, except
the sense of guilt. This has humbled me to
the dust: but the assurances that are given me
by the Saviour of the world of the divine
pardon and favour, upon sincere repentance,
have calmed my troubled spirit, and filled
my mind with peace and joy, which the world
can neither give nor take away. Thus, with∣out
any change for the better in my outward
circumstances, I find myself changed from a
distracted, poor, despairing wretch, to a con∣tented,
happy, grateful being; thankful for,
and pleased with my present state of existence;
yet exulting in the hope of quitting it for end∣less
glory and happiness.</P>
<P>O! Sir, tell the unthinking mortals, who
will not take the pains of enquiring into those
truths which most concern them, and who are
led by fashion, and the pride of human reason,
into a contempt for the sacred oracles of God,
tell them this truth, which experience hath
taught me, that though vice is constantly at∣tended
<PB N="174" REF="174"/>
by misery, virtue itself cannot confer
happiness in this world, except it is animated
with the hopes of eternal bliss in the world to
come.</P>
