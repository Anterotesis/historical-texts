<SPEAKER>Beggar.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am sure No-body can dispute mine. I own my self of the Company of Beggars; and I make one at their weekly Fe∣stivals at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s. I have a small yearly Sallery for my Catches, and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I please, which is more than most Poets can say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Player.</SPEAKER>
<P>As we live by the Muses, 'tis but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit where-ever we find it. The Muses, contrary to all other Ladies, pay no Distinction to Drels, and never partially mistake the Pertness of Em∣broidery for Wit, nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness. Be the Author who he will, we push his Play as far as it will go. So (though you are in Want) I wish you Success heartily.</P>

<P>This Piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of <HI>James Chari∣ter</HI> and <HI>Moll Lay,</HI> two most excellent Ballad-Singers. I have introduc'd the Similes that are in all your celebrated <HI>Operas</HI>: The <HI>Swallow,</HI> the <HI>Moth,</HI> the <HI>Bee,</HI> the <HI>Ship,</HI> the <HI>Flower,</HI> &amp;c. Be∣sides, I have a Prison Scene which the Ladies reckon charmingly pathetick. As to the Parts, I have observ'd such a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies, that it is impossible for either of them to take Offence. I hope I may be forgi∣ven, that I have not made my Opera through∣out unnatural, like those in vogue; for I have no Recitative: Excepting this, as I have con∣sented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue, it must be allow'd an Opera in all its Forms. The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently re∣presented by our selves in our great Room at St, <HI>Giles</HI>'s, so that I cannot too often acknowledge your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage.</P>

<P>If none of the Gang take her off, she may, in the common course of Business, live a Twelve-month longer. I love to let Women scape.

<P>Without dispute, she is a fine Woman! 'Twas to her I was oblig'd for my Education, and (to say a bold Word) she hath train'd up more young Fellows to the Business than the Gaming-table.</P>

<P>Murder is as fashionable a Crime as a Man can be guilty of. How many fine Gentlemen have we in <HI>New∣gate</HI> every Year, purely upon that Article!

<P>The Captain keeps too good Company ever to grow rich. <HI>Mary-bone</HI> and the Chocolate-houses are his undoing. The Man that proposes to get Money by Play should have the Education of a fine Gentleman, and be train'd up to it from his Youth.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Peach.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew she was always a proud Slut; and now the Wench hath play'd the Fool and married, because forsooth she would do like the Gentry. Can you support the Expence of a Husband, Hussy, in gaming, drinking and whoring? have you Money enough to carry on the daily Quarrels of Man and Wife about who shall squander most? There are not many Husbands and Wives, who can bear the Charges of plaguing one another in a handsome way. If you must be married, could you introduce no-body into our Family but a Highwayman? Why, thou foolish Jade, thou wilt be as ill-us'd, and as much neglected, as if thou hadst married a Lord!</P>

<P>Let not your Anger, my Dear, break through the Rules of Decency, for the Captain looks upon himself in the Military Capacity, as a Gentleman by his Profession.

<P>The hard Times oblige me to go very near in my Dealing.—To be sure, of late Years I have been a great Sufferer by the Parliament.—Three thousand Pounds would hardly make me amends.—The Act for Destroying the Mint, was a severe Cut upon our Business—'Till then, if a Customer stept out of the way—we knew where to have her—No doubt you know Mrs. <HI>Coaxer</HI>—there's a Wench now ('till to-day) with a good Suit of Cloaths of mine upon her Back, and I could never set Eyes upon her for three Months together—Since the Act too against Im∣prisonment for small Sums, my Loss there too hath been very considerable, and it must be so, when a Lady can bor∣row a handsome Petticoat, or a clean Gown, and I not have the least Hank upon her!

<P>Consider, Mr. <HI>Peachum,</HI> that Watch was remark∣able, and not of very safe Sale.—If you have any black Velvet Scarfs—they are a handsome Winter-wear; and take with most Gentlemen who deal with my Customers.—'Tis I that put the Ladies upon a good Foot. 'Tis not Youth or Beauty that fixes their Price. The Gentle∣men always pay according to their Dress from half a Crown to two Guineas; and yet those Hussies make nothing of bilking of me.—Then too, allowing for Accidents.—I have eleven fine Customers now down under the Sur∣geon's Hands,—what with Fees and other Expences, there are great Goings-out, and no Comings-in, and not a Far∣thing to pay for at least a Month's cloathing.—We run great Risques—great Risques indeed.</P>

<P>But, honest Friend, I hope you don't intend that <HI>Macheath</HI> shall be really executed.</P>

<P>Most certainly, Sir.—To make the Piece perfect, I was for doing strict poetical Justice.—<HI>Macheath</HI> is to

be hang'd; and for the other Personages of the Drama, the Audience must have suppos'd they were all either hang'd or transported.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Play.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Friend, this is a down-right deep Tra∣gedy. The Catastrophe is manifestly wrong, for an Opera must end happily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Objection, Sir, is very just; and is easily re∣mov'd. For you must allow, that in this kind of Drama, 'tis no matter how absurdly things are brought about.—So—you Rabble there—run and cry a Reprieve—let the Prisoner be brought back to his Wives in Triumph.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Play.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this we must do, to comply with the Taste of the Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Through the whole Piece you may observe such a Similitude of Manner in high and low Life, that it is diffi∣cult to determine whether (in the fashionable Vices) the fine Gentlemen imitate the Gentlemen of the Road, or the Gentlemen of the Road the fine Gentlemen.—Had the Play remain'd, as I at first intended, it would have car∣ried a most excellent Moral. 'Twould have shown that the lower Sort of People have their Vices in a degree as well as the Rich: And that they are punish'd for them.</P>

<P>So, it seems, I am not left to my Choice, but must have a Wife at last.—Look ye, my Dears, we will have no Controversie now. Let us give this Day to Mirth, and I am sure she who thinks her self my Wife will testify her Joy by a Dance.</P>

<P>Ladies, I hope you will give me leave to present a Partner to each of you.
