<P>THE following <HI>POEM</HI> came into my Hands by Accident, if the general Approbation with which this little Piece has been spread, may be call'd by so slight a Term as Acciâˆ£dent. It is this Approbation which makes it unnecessary for me to make any Apology but to the Author: As he cannot but feel some Satisfaction in having pleas'd so many Readers already, I flatter myself he will forgive my communicating that Pleasure to many more.</P>

<HEAD>AN ELEGY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE <HI>Curfeu</HI> tolls the Knell of parting Day,</L>
<L>The lowing Herd winds slowly o'er the Lea,</L>
<L>The Plow-man homeward plods his weary Way,</L>
<L>And leaves the World to Darkness, and to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now fades the glimmering Landscape on the Sight,</L>
<L>And all the Air a solemn Stillness holds;</L>
<L>Save where the Beetle wheels his droning Flight,</L>
<L>And drowsy Tinklings lull the distant Folds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Save that from yonder Ivy-mantled Tow'r</L>
<L>The mopeing Owl does to the Moon complain</L>
<L>Of such, as wand'ring near her sacred Bow'r,</L>
<L>Molest her ancient solitary Reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<L>Beneath those rugged Elms, that Yew-Tree's Shade,</L>
<L>Where heaves the Turf in many a mould'ring Heap,</L>
<L>Each in his narrow Cell for ever laid,</L>
<L>The rude Forefathers of the Hamlet sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The breezy Call of Incense-breathing Morn,</L>
<L>The Swallow twitt'ring from the Straw-built Shed,</L>
<L>The Cock's shrill Clarion, or the ecchoing Horn,</L>
<L>No more shall wake them from their lowly Bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For them no more the blazing Hearth shall burn,</L>
<L>Or busy Houswife ply her Evening Care:</L>
<L>No Children run to lisp their Sire's Return,</L>
<L>Or climb his Knees the envied Kiss to share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft did the Harvest to their Sickle yield,</L>
<L>Their Furrow oft the stubborn Glebe has broke;</L>
<L>How jocund did they they drive their Team afield!</L>
<L>How bow'd the Woods beneath their sturdy Stroke!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not Ambition mock their useful Toil,</L>
<L>Their homely Joys and Destiny obscure;</L>
<L>Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful Smile,</L>
<L>The short and simple Annals of the Poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<L>The Boast of Heraldry, the Pomp of Pow'r,</L>
<L>And all that Beauty, all that Wealth e'er gave,</L>
<L>Awaits alike th' inevitable Hour.</L>
<L>The Paths of Glory lead but to the Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive, ye Proud, th' involuntary Fault,</L>
<L>If Memory to these no Trophies raise,</L>
<L>Where thro' the long-drawn Isle and fretted Vault</L>
<L>The pealing Anthem swells the Note of Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can storied Urn or animated Bust</L>
<L>Back to its Mansion call the fleeting Breath?</L>
<L>Can Honour's Voice provoke the silent Dust,</L>
<L>Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold Ear of Death!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps in this neglected Spot is laid</L>
<L>Some Heart once pregnant with celestial Fire,</L>
<L>Hands that the Reins of Empire might have sway'd,</L>
<L>Or wak'd to Extacy the living Lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Knowledge to their Eyes her ample Page</L>
<L>Rich with the Spoils of Time did ne'er unroll;</L>
<L>Chill Penury repress'd their noble Rage,</L>
<L>And froze the genial Current of the Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>Full many a Gem of purest Ray serene,</L>
<L>The dark unfathom'd Caves of Ocean bear:</L>
<L>Full many a Flower is born to blush unseen,</L>
<L>And waste its Sweetness on the desart Air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some Village<HI>-Hampden</HI> that with dauntless Breast</L>
<L>The little Tyrant of his Fields withstood;</L>
<L>Some mute inglorious <HI>Milton</HI> here may rest,</L>
<L>Some <HI>Cromwell</HI> guiltless of his Country's Blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' Applause of list'ning Senates to command,</L>
<L>The Threats of Pain and Ruin to despise,</L>
<L>To scatter Plenty o'er a smiling Land,</L>
<L>And read their Hist'ry in a Nation's Eyes</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their Lot forbad: nor circumscrib'd alone</L>
<L>Their growing Virtues, but their Crimes confin'd;</L>
<L>Forbad to wade through Slaughter to a Throne,</L>
<L>And shut the Gates of Mercy on Mankind,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The struggling Pangs of conscious Truth to hide,</L>
<L>To quench the Blushes of ingenuous Shame,</L>
<L>Or heap the Shrine of Luxury and Pride</L>
<L>With Incense, kindled at the Muse's Flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<L>Far from the madding Crowd's ignoble Strife,</L>
<L>Their sober Wishes never learn'd to stray;</L>
<L>Along the cool sequester'd Vale of Life</L>
<L>They kept the noiseless Tenor of their Way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet ev'n these Bones from Insult to protect</L>
<L>Some frail Memorial still erected nigh,</L>
<L>With uncouth Rhimes and shapeless Sculpture deck'd,</L>
<L>Implores the passing Tribute of a Sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their Name, their Years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,</L>
<L>The Place of Fame and Elegy supply:</L>
<L>And many a holy Text around she strews,</L>
<L>That teach the rustic Moralist to dye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For who to dumb Forgetfulness a Prey,</L>
<L>This pleasing anxious Being e'er resign'd,</L>
<L>Left the warm Precincts of the chearful Day,</L>
<L>Nor cast one longing ling'ring Look behind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On some fond Breast the parting Soul relies,</L>
<L>Some pious Drops the closing Eye requires;</L>
<L>Ev'n from the Tomb the Voice of Nature cries</L>
<L>Awake, and faithful to her wonted Fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<L>For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead</L>
<L>Dost in these Lines their artless Tale relate;</L>
<L>If chance, by lonely Contemplation led,</L>
<L>Some hidden Spirit shall inquire thy Fate,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,</L>
<L>'Oft have we seen him at the Peep of Dawn</L>
<L>'Brushing with hasty Steps the Dews away</L>
<L>'To meet the Sun upon the upland Lawn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'There at the Foot of yonder nodding Beech</L>
<L>'That wreathes its old fantastic Roots so high,</L>
<L>'His listless Length at Noontide wou'd he stretch,</L>
<L>'And pore upon the Brook that babbles by.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Hard by yon Wood, now frowning as in Scorn,</L>
<L>'Mutt'ring his wayward Fancies he wou'd rove,</L>
<L>'Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,</L>
<L>'Or craz'd with Care, or cross'd in hopeless Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'One Morn I miss'd him on the custom'd Hill,</L>
<L>'Along the Heath, and near his fav'rite Tree;</L>
<L>'Another came; nor yet beside the Rill,</L>
<L>'Nor up the Lawn, nor at the Wood was he.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<L>'The next with Dirges due in sad Array</L>
<L>'Slow thro' the Church-way Path we saw him born.</L>
<L>'Approach and read (for thou can'st read) the Lay,</L>
<L>'Grav'd on the Stone beneath yon aged Thorn.</L>
</LG>
<DIV2 TYPE="epitaph">
<HEAD>The EPITAPH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HERE rests his Head upon the Lap of Earth</L>
<L>A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown:</L>
<L>Fair Science frown'd not on his humble Birth,</L>
<L>And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Large was his Bounty, and his Soul sincere,</L>
<L>Heav'n did a Recompence as largely send:</L>
<L>He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a Tear:</L>
<L>He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No farther seek his Merits to disclose,</L>
<L>Or draw his Frailties from their dread Abode,</L>
<L>(There they alike in trembling Hope repose)</L>
<L>The Bosom of his Father and his God.</L>
