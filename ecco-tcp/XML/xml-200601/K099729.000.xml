<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT
Concerning the
LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>R. <HI>Dryden</HI> much admires <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s
Tempest; In that Comedy, new
PERSONAGES are introduced; for
whom, he thinks, the Poet has in∣vented
a Language equally uncom∣mon.
True it is, that such is the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>recept of a CRITICK, in no small repute. <HI>Be
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Language,</HI> says <HI>Quinctilian, alway suited to the</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>Matter.</HI> True it also is, that <NOTE PLACE="foot" N="†">See <HI>DION. HALICARN</HI>: who admires him on that Ac∣count.</NOTE> <HI>Homer</HI> used the
most rustick Words, drawn from the <HI>Beotians</HI>;
<HI>Virgil,</HI> from <HI>Ennius,</HI> in his HEROICKS, render'd his
Language uncommon; <HI>Milton, Shakespear, Spen∣cer,</HI>
and our contemporary <HI>Pastoral Writers,</HI> by
reviving the antiquated <HI>English</HI> terms, by chusing
and culling the finest Words of our Glorious AN∣CESTORS.
In the Steps of these, our Swain has
ventur'd to tread; and where the Phrase in use
was not suited to the softness and simplicity of
his CHARACTERS, as he is acquainted with the
Dialect of most Counties in <HI>England,</HI> has from
thence drawn the tenderest Expressions, as he
thought, and best adapted to the simplicity of his
sentiments. Induced, I suppose, to take these
Liberties in Pastoral, by what that excellent
Judge of Poetry Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> has laid down on
that Poem. How beautiful, says he, is the old
Pastoral BALLAD, beginning thus,
<Q><L><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Guardians.</HI> N: 22, 23, 30 and 40.</NOTE> <HI>RAGER</HI> go vetch tha <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Cows.</NOTE> Kee, or else tha Zun</L>
<L>Will quite be go, be vore c'have half a don.</L></Q>
And into Language how much finer than the Au∣thor's,
has he turn'd a Thought of <HI>Virgil.</HI>
<Q><PB REF="4"/><L>And what that hight, which girds the Welkin sheen,</L>
<L>Where twelve gay Signs in meet array are seen.</L></Q>
This great Man adds, that by imitating the ru∣sticity
of the <HI>Dorick,</HI> by the help of the old obso∣lete
<HI>Roman</HI> Language, <HI>Virgil</HI> might have attain'd
as much of the Air of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> as <HI>Phillips</HI> hath
that of <HI>Spencer,</HI> by using the antiquated ENGLISH.</P>
<P>Fewer Old-words, indeed, has our present Wri∣ter
admitted, than are found, either in <HI>Spencer,</HI> or
the incomparable <HI>Pastorals</HI> of Mr: <HI>Phillips</HI>: But in
return, has often made use of those once introdu∣ced.
As his CHARACTERS are particularly simple
and tender, much also has he imitated <HI>Spencer</HI>'s
manner, of changing the vulgar dress, as 'twere,
of his Words, yet leaving the Main Body so as to
be known. <HI>Homer</HI>'s manner of performing this
<HI>Aristotle</HI> shows in the 21 Chap. of his <HI>Poesie</HI>:
He used for <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and for
<GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c. Virgil</HI> did it, by changing
ILLI into OLLI, and the like. <HI>Milton</HI> by altering
HERMIT into EREMITE; ENTERPRIZE into EM∣PRIZE,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Spencer</HI> by affixing <HI>y</HI> and <HI>a</HI> before,
and <HI>en, et, ie,</HI> after his Words; which gives an
inexpressible softness to, without hiding the Lan∣guage.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
This Liberty every good heroick Writer has ta∣ken;
And well knew <HI>Spencer,</HI> that Pastoral still
more required it. He has given us, in his <HI>Fairy-Queen,</HI>
a new Language: The reason must be, be∣cause
his Scene lyes in a new Place. But how
much more has he done it in his Pastorals.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other places, in the Preface to her <HI>HOMER.</HI></NOTE> <HI>D'acier,</HI> and many Frenchmen, complain of
the penury and stiffness of their Language, thro'
the want of this. And Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> observes, that
the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> did the like. Yet must I con∣fess, that even among the Pastoral Writers, no
one but <HI>Theocritus, Spencer,</HI> and our present <HI>British</HI>
Swains, durst ever venture themselves in this Pa∣storal Path,
being affraid and unwilling to forgo
that Honour which either a refin'd Language or
a sublime one procures: But then must we add,
that from thence it is, that no Critick, but who
dares not stir a step without Leading-strings, as
<HI>Scaliger, Rapin,</HI> &amp;c, has ever allow'd any else to
be Pastoral Writers.</P>
<P>But is any One dissatisfied with our rural STILE,
read he a full Vindication of one much more so:
such he'll find before <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Folio Edition.</NOTE> <HI>Spencer</HI>'s Pastorals; and
by his Friend Mr. <HI>Harvey.</HI> For who knows not,
<PB REF="6"/>
that his Language was equally uncommon in his
Day, and in <HI>Our</HI>'s; Our TONGUE receiving no vi∣sible
Alteration in one hundred Years. This ap∣pears
from <HI>Ben. Johnson, Hooker, Our Common-Prayer Book,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Reader will observe I here only bring some
few <HI>Authorities</HI>; The reason that I my self de∣cline
laying down any thing concerning the true
Pastoral Language is, because we shall see, I be∣lieve,
a Discourse in a short time on the Nature
of this kind of Poetry. Where that TENDER in
the Language, which is agreeable to Pastoral, will
be considered; and distinguish'd from the TENDER
which is suitable to the Epick, and that which the
Tragick Poem requires.</P>
<P>Conclude we then with what the Learned <HI>Basil
Kennet</HI> says, in his Life of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> after
speaking of his rustick Stile. <HI>As for our selves,</HI>
SAYS HE, <HI>the</HI> SCOTCH-SONGS, <HI>which pass with so
much Applause, show, that it is not impossible to re∣vive
this old Conduct among Us with Success.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AS for the MORAL and ACTIONS in each of
the following <HI>Pastorals,</HI> (for Action is the
only <HI>Unity</HI> to be kept in that Poem) they lye ob∣vious
to every Eye. But as the Pastoral does not
paint the CHARACTERS so lively as the tragick or
epick Poem, those of our Shepherdesses are speci∣fied
in the <HI>Arguments.</HI> And this for the ease of
the SOFT-SEX, whose Favour and Approbation our
young SWAIN seems particularly desirous of.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>UBBIN,</HI> the Writer so call'd, was
acquainted, with <HI>PAPLET</HI> and <HI>SOFLIN.</HI>
All Young was <HI>PAPLET</HI> and ignorant of
Love; <HI>SOFLIN</HI> more experienc'd, but
equally tender and innocent. The first
eager to be let into the Nature and
Manner of Lovers and the other <HI>SEX</HI>; The other of
a Temper particularly free and inclining. These, as
<HI>CUBBIN</HI> was inform'd, were at Evening gone out to
a <HI>BUSH</HI> of a sweet and pleasant Scituation to tattle
of Love, and of <HI>COLLIKIN SOFLIN'S</HI> Lover. In
pain is <HI>CUBBIN,</HI> least the gentle <HI>PAPLET</HI> should fall
in Love with him too, and goes forth to skulk near
the <HI>BUSH</HI> to hear if it indeed was so. There does the
latter part of their Discourse, which alone he hears,
confirm the hear-say. When the gloom of Night
draws on, they go to bath and cool 'em in <HI>EDEN</HI> Brook. There is <HI>PAPLET</HI> solitary and musing; and thence, ig∣norant
<PB REF="9"/>
of her Ail, returns alone, by Moonshine to the
<HI>BUSH</HI>: For there <HI>COLLIKIN,</HI> that Morn, had loll'd
with his <HI>LOVE. CUBBIN</HI> soon discovers her uneasi∣ness;
forsakes hit Covert to attempt her relief; But
endeavouring to divert her thoughts from <HI>COLLIKIN,</HI>
is chid from her sight. So being averse to her Cure,
she falls intirely in Love.</P>
<P>The time, in this PIECE, is from <HI>Noon</HI> to <HI>Night</HI>;
The Season <HI>Summer</HI>; and the Scene on the
Banks of the Brook <HI>Eden</HI>; which runs out of
the <HI>Medway,</HI> some Miles West of TUNBRIDGE in

TO THE
Second PASTORAL.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Auney</HI> and <HI>Lallet</HI> had an equal Value
for each other. <HI>Fauney</HI> was Young,
and of a most taking Aspect: <HI>Lallet</HI>
beauteous and particularly tender-hearted.
These walk together to a <HI>GROVE</HI> at
hand; to tast the pleasance of the Season, and the
sweets of each othe's talk. There long they bay
<PB REF="36"/>
themselves in the soft Delices of the Morn; the
harmless Swain and gentle Shepherdess. <HI>Lallet,</HI> at
length, leaps up to gather <HI>STRAWBERRYS</HI> for her Lo∣ver;
while he, for her, sate plaiting Flowery Gyr∣londs,
and wishing her return. Long he sate, and
long he wish'd. But she, to raise his Love, de∣lay'd
her return. <HI>Fauney,</HI> as she was about to sur∣prize
and joy him with her sight, rises and runs to
<HI>Paplet</HI> to enquire for her. Then 'tis that <HI>Lallet</HI>'s
softness of heart appears. With watry Eyes she ram∣bles
thro' the <HI>GROVE</HI>; and accuses her self of Cruelty.
There find her another Lad and Lass, endeavour to
allay her Grief, and sing a chearful <HI>SONG</HI> for her Di∣version.
At length, <HI>Cubbin</HI> begs her to go home
with him. She declines it, lest it might occasion a se∣cond
Uneasiness to <HI>Fauney</HI>; and resolve's to punish
her self by staying where she was. She does so. Till
<HI>Fauney,</HI> at length doth come. He skulks behind the
<HI>CAVE</HI> she sat in, and hears how uneasy she was for
making him so. Anon he surprizes her with his sight,
drys up her Tears and conducts home in the height of
<HI>GOOD-HUMOUR.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Time, tho' it begins in the Morning,
the main of this Pastoral is in the EVENTIDE, and
the Moon-light Night that succeeds. The Sea∣son
