<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>PAGET.</HI></STAGE>
<LG>
<L>IN ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> the Infant <HI>Muse</HI>'s School,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Vice</HI> first felt the Pen of <HI>Ridicule,</HI></L>
<L>With honest Freedom and impartial Blows</L>
<L>The <HI>Muse</HI> attack'd each <HI>Vice</HI> as it arose:</L>
<L>No Grandeur could the <HI>Mighty Villain</HI> screen</L>
<L>From the just <HI>Satyr</HI> of the <HI>Comick</HI> Scene:</L>
<L>No Titles could the <HI>daring Poet</HI> cool,</L>
<L>Nor save the great <HI>Right Honourable Fool.</HI></L>
<L>They spar'd not even the Aggressor's Name,</L>
<L>And Publick <HI>Villany</HI> felt Publick <HI>Shame.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long hath this gen'rous Method been disus'd,</L>
<L>For <HI>Vice</HI> hath grown too great to be abus'd;</L>
<L>By Pow'r, defended from the Piercing Dart,</L>
<L>It reigns, and triumphs in the <HI>Lordly Heart</HI>;</L>
<L>While <HI>Beaus,</HI> and <HI>Cits,</HI> and <HI>Squires,</HI> our Scenes afford,</L>
<L><HI>Justice</HI> preserves the <HI>Rogues</HI> who weild the Sword;</L>
<L>All <HI>Satyr</HI> against her Tribunal's quash'd,</L>
<L>Nor lash the <HI>Bards,</HI> for fear of being lash'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the Heroick <HI>Muse</HI> who sings To-night,</L>
<L>Through these neglected Tracks attempts her Flight:</L>
<L><HI>Vice,</HI> cloath'd with Pow'r, she combats with her Pen,</L>
<L>And fearless, dares the <HI>Lyon</HI> in his Den.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then only Reverence to <HI>Pow'r</HI> is due,</L>
<L>When <HI>Publick Welfare</HI> is its only View:</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>
But when the <HI>Champions,</HI> whom the <HI>Publick</HI> arm</L>
<L>For their own Good with <HI>Pow'r,</HI> attempt their <HI>Harm,</HI></L>
<L>He sure must meet the <HI>general Applause,</HI></L>
<L>Who 'gainst those <HI>Traytors</HI> fights the <HI>Publick Cause.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And while these Scenes the conscious <HI>Knave</HI> displease,</L>
<L>Who feels within the <HI>Criminal</HI> he sees,</L>
<L>The <HI>Uncorrupt</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> must smile, to find</L>
<L>No Mark for <HI>Satyr</HI> in his <HI>Generous Mind.</HI></L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>MULLART.</HI></STAGE>
<LG>
<L><HI>RAPE upon Rape</HI>! what Author ever chose</L>
<L>A Name so sure to make the Fair his Foes!</L>
<L>And, Ladies, I can read in all your Faces,</L>
<L>Our Author is not much in your good Graces;</L>
<L>But pray, confess, does all this Fury fall,</L>
<L>Because these Scenes <HI>Rape upon Rape</HI> we call?</L>
<L>Or is it—that we have no Rape at all?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our modern Beaus in Vigour are so hearty,</L>
<L>And modern Dames so very full of Vartue,</L>
<L>So scarce immodest Women, Men so urging,</L>
<L>A Rape's almost as common as a—Virgin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! may our Youth whose Vigour is so parlous,</L>
<L>To <HI>Italy</HI> be wafted with <HI>Don Carlos</HI>;</L>
<L>There should one Victory but give them Scope,</L>
<L>They would not leave one Maidenhead for the Pope;</L>
<L>Or should some new Pope <HI>Joan</HI> the Chair possess,</L>
<L>They'd play the Devil with her—Holiness.</L>
<L>Rape upon Rape should follow Blows on Blows,</L>
<L>And New <HI>Rome</HI> fall, by what the Old arose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Lucretia</HI> surely, tho' her Fame has sounded,</L>
<L>With Ardour for her Country ne'er abounded;</L>
<L>Who so abhorr'd, what had her Country founded.</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
Heathenish Wretch! the Pious Christian Wife,</L>
<L>Tho' ravish'd, still contents herself with Life:</L>
<L>So zealous from Self-Murther we refrain,</L>
<L>We live, tho' sure of ravishing again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What need has She of Penance or Repenting,</L>
<L>Who undergoes it all without consenting?</L>
<L>She sure, tho' with her Sword <HI>Lucretian</HI> swagger,</L>
<L>Requires a Cordial rather than a Dagger.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But may no fear of Ravishing affright</L>
<L>The beauteous kind Spectators of To-night;</L>
<L>Safe to your Husbands Arms may you escape,</L>
<L>And never know that dreadful thing, a <HI>RAPE.</HI></L>

<SPEAKER>HILARET.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ELL, <HI>Cloris,</HI> this is a mad Frolick. I am horridly frighted at the Thoughts of throwing my self into the Power of a young Fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is natural to us to be frighted at first: I was in a little Terror my self on my Wedding-Day, but it went all off before the next Morning; a Husband, like other Bugbears, loses all his Horror when we once know him thoroughly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he should not prove a good Husband—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must not prove a good Wife—If he keeps a Mistress, do you keep a Gallant; if he
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
stay out with his Friends at a Tavern, do you be merry with your Friends at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You give fine Advice indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word, Madam, it was such as I fol∣lowed my self. I had a Rogue of a Husband that robbed me of all I had, and kept a Mistress under my Nose: but I was even with him: for it hath been ever my Opinion that a Husband, like a Courtier, who is above doing the Duties of his Office, should keep a Deputy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose you had been in Love with your Husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so I was, Madam, as long as he deserved it: but Love, like Fire, naturally goes out when it hath nothing to feed on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if it be possible to be assured of a Lover's Sincerity, I think I may be assured of <HI>Constant:</HI> at least it is adviseable to persuade my self of his Truth whom I should Love, tho' he wanted it:—Ah, <HI>Cloris!</HI> you may as easily remove a Rock as a Woman's Passion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet it is very often built on a sandy Foun∣dation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love is the same, whatever be its Object: We as often like Men for imaginary as real Perfections; we all look through a Prismatick Glass in Love, and whatever Beauties we have once fancied, we never lose the Opinion of—our Amorous Faith is as implicit as our Religious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have any Judgment in Mankind, and I am sure I have had some Experince in them, your Passion could have been no where better fixed: Capt. <HI>Constant</HI> hath all the Qualities any Woman can desire. He hath Youth, Beauty, Vigour, Gallantry, Con∣stancy, and as Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> says, a long <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Ay there it goes, tick tack, tick tack, like the Pendulum of a Clock. What Mischief are you hatch∣ing,
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
hey?—It is impossible that two Women should be together without producing Mischief.</P>
</SP>

<P>I always thought a Man and Woman the more likely to produce Mischief: and yet I think them the properer Company.</P>

<P>I do not believe the Head of Cardinal <HI>Fleury</HI> can be more perplexed, than mine is with this Girl. To govern your self, is greater than to govern a King∣dom, said an old Philosopher; and to govern a Woman is greater than to govern twenty Kingdoms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you would not perplex your self with Cardinals or Kingdoms, I wish you would mind your own Business, instead of the Publick's; dear Papa, don't give your self any more trouble about <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> un∣less you can get him for a Son-in-Law.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not if I were a King. I will make you a little sensible who <HI>Don Carlos</HI> is.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I do not understand one Word of your Politicks.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry you do not—A News-Paper would be a more profitable Entertainment for you than a Romance. You would find more in one half Sheet, than in the grand <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>

<P>More Lies very probably—You know I do read the Home Paragraphs in the <HI>Whitehail</HI> Evening Post: and that's the best of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you would be informed in these Matters, you must read all that come out: about forty every Day, and some Days fifty: and of a <HI>Saturday</HI> about fourscore. Would you continue in such a Course but one Twelvemonth, I do not question but you might know as much of Politicks as—any Man that comes to our Coffee-house. And I had rather see you a Politician, than a Woman of Quality.</P>

<P>If I may speak freely, it would have been bet∣ter for me that you had been less a Politician.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are deceived, very much deceived: but some Fool hath put this into your Head. You may live to see me one of the greatest Men in <HI>England.</HI> Did I not say at the Siege of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> that within one three Years, we should see whether we should have Peace or no. And yet I am an <HI>Ignoramus</HI>; I know nothing I warrant you: I had better have con∣tinued a Merchant no doubt: but then what had be∣come of my Projects? where had been all those twenty different Schemes which I have now ready to lay be∣fore the Parliament, greatly for my own Honour and the Interest of my Country? Harkye, I have con∣trived a Method to pay off the Debts of the Nation, without a Penny of Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you will not get a Penny by it, I dare swear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no certainly: tho' I would not take twenty thousand Pounds for the Advantage which will arise to me from it. It hath lain these three Years in a Friend's Hands of mine of the House of Commons; who assured me not many Days ago that it should be taken shortly into Consideration, tho' he believed it could not be this Sessions.</P>

<P>Before I go into a Tavern again with a Man who will sneak away after the first Bottle, may I be cursed with the odious sight of a Pint as long as I live: or become Member of a City-Club where Men drink out of Thimbles, that the Fancy may be heightened by the Wine, about the same time that the Understanding is improved by the Conversation: I'll sooner drink Coffee with a Politician, Tea with a fine Lady, or 'Rack Punch with a fine Gentleman, than thus be made a Whetstone of, to sharpen my Friends Inclinations, that some little Strumpet may enjoy the Benefit of that good Humour which I have raised.</P>

<P>Nay, if that be all you accuse me of, I will confess it freely, I have employ'd my Time pretty well: Tho' as I do not remember ever to have done you the Honour of Dubbing, Mr. <HI>Justice,</HI> I cannot see why you should be so incensed against me; for I do not i∣magine you any otherwise an Enemy to these Amuse∣ments, than a Popish Priest to Sin, or a Doctor to Di∣sease.</P>

<P>It is indeed a ticklish Point, and it were ad∣visable to make it up as soon as possible. The first Loss is always the least. It is better to wet your Coat than your Skin, and to run home when the Clouds begin to drop, than in the middle of the Storm. In short, it were better to give a brace of hundred Pounds to to make up the Matter now, than to venture the Con∣sequence. I am heartily concerned, to see a Gentleman in such a Misfortune.

An Intrigue with a rich Justice's Wife, is not to be slighted by a young Fellow of a desperate Fortune. I do not doubt but in a very short Time, when I am taken up for the next Rape, to bribe the Justice with his own Money.—Lend a Man your Gold, he may forget the Debt; venture your Life for him, he may forget the Obligation; but once engage his Wife, and you secure his Friendship.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, at my first Return to <HI>England,</HI> the Prospect of War was in every one's Eye, and not on∣ly the Reports of the People, but the Augmentation of the Troops assured us of its Approach; upon which, I resolved to embarque my small Remains of Fortune in the Service of my Country, and obtained the same Commission on that Occasion, which I had enjoyed in the <HI>Indies.</HI> My History is not very full of Adventures; I continued therein 'till the Reduction, when I shared the Fate of several unhappy brave Fel∣lows, and was sent a begging with a red Coat on my Back.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Faculty of the Cloth to be ragged.—Red is as apt to be ragged, as White to be soil'd.

<P>What, did she appear against you?</P>

<P>No; they said she was ill of some Bruises she had received, but desired I might be kept in Custody 'till the Afternoon, at which Time she would appear against me. But by what <HI>Hilaret</HI> hath told us, and by some Methods which have been used to extort Money from me, I am inclined to fancy it all a contrived Piece of Villany of the Justice, and not of the Woman's, as I at first imagined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be assured of it;—if there be Roguery, the Justice hath the chief Part in it.

I in the greatest Agony of Rage repelled him with my utmost Force; he redoubled his Attacks, I slackened my Resistance; he entreated, I raved; he sighed, I cry'd; he pressed, I swooned; he—</P>

Come drink the Justice's Health, as a Token of Amity; the Justice is a good honest drunken Fellow. But let me give you some wholesome Advice, <STAGE>[to the Justice]</STAGE> leave off fornica∣ting, leave the Girls to the Boys, and stand to thy Bottle: It is a Virtue becoming our Years; and don't be too hard on a wild honest young Rake. Thou hast committed a couple of the pretiest Boys to-day, don't do so any more.—Be as severe as you please to Whores and Gamesters, that offer to act without your License; but if ever you grant a Warrant for a Friend of mine again, you shall not only drink the Wine, but eat the Bottle too.

<P>SURE, never Child inherited less of a Father's Disposition than mine; her Mother certainly played me foul in the begetting her: I, who have been my whole Life noted for Sobriety, could ne∣ver have given Being to so wild a Creature: I begin to recollect having seen a tall Half-pay Officer at my House formerly: Nor do I think the Girl unlike him. I am sure she hath been ever wild enough, to have had any Officer in the Kingdom for her Father. Nature hath been kind to the Male of all Creatures but Man: The Bull, the Horse, the Dog are not encumbered even with their own Off-spring; that Care falls only to the Females: But Man, when once a gabling Priest hath chattered a few mischievous Words over him, is bound to have and to hold from that Day forward all the Brats his Wife is pleased to bestow on him. Yet I must own the Girl hath been ever dutiful to me, till she became acquainted with this cursed Fellow in a Red Coat. Why should Red have such Charms in the Eyes of a Woman? The <HI>Roman</HI> Senate kept their Armies abroad to prevent their sharing in their Lands at home, we should do the same to prevent their sha∣ring in our Wives. A tall lusty Fellow shall make more work for a Midwife in one Winter at home, than he can for a Surgeon in ten Summers abroad.</P>

<P>My dear <HI>Isabella,</HI> I am so overjoyed at this unexpected Meeting, that I do not ask for the Safety of our Treasure. Since the Sea hath refunded <HI>Isabella,</HI> let it take the Jewels.</P>

<SP>

<P>The Sea hath been even kinder than your Wish, it hath return'd you both.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Politick,</HI> I am heartily concerned at this Misfortune which hath befallen your Daughter.</P>
</SP>

<P>Mr. <HI>Politick!</HI>—By Heavens, his Fea∣tures are the same. Had you not a Son, Sir, once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I had; but I turn'd him out of Doors, and believe he was hanged long ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am his Ghost, just arrived from the <HI>Indies.</HI> When you turn'd me out of Doors, I got ad∣mitted into the <HI>East-India</HI> Company's Service; I changed my Name in order to escape your Disco∣very—and I hope you will now give us both your Blessing.</P>

<SP>

<P>Mr. <HI>Politick,</HI> I rejoice in the Union of our Families; this Lady, your Son's Wife, is my Sister—and if fourscore thousand Pounds can make the Match agreeable to you, it will be so.</P>

<P>Hath the wild Rogue made his Fortune at last! Well, Son, I give you my Blessing; and my dear Daughter I give you Joy, and I hope the Boy will give it you, ay, and lasting constant Joy—If he doth not make you a good Husband, I'll not own him; if he doth not make you blessed, he shall have no Blessing of mine.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have never been witness to such a Complication of Villany. Sir, <STAGE>[to Constant]</STAGE> I assure you, and all of you, you shall have sufficient Repara∣ton for the Injuries you have suffer'd. And Sir, by the Characters which I have had from my Sister of that Gentleman, I do not think your Daughter can be better disposed of, let the Difference of Fortune be what it please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, tho' his Estate be not equal now, it may become so; for no Man hath a better Insight into Politicks.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if his Studies bend that Way, no Man indeed can tell to what his Estate may come—Had I known this sooner, my Doors should never have been shut against him. Sir, I shall be glad to confa∣bulate with you at my House—and if you should set your Heart on my Daughter, I do not believe I shall do any thing to break it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, there is no Hour like the Present: This Hour hath proved lucky to your Family—Give me leave to present your Daughter to one whom if she deserves, I shall be proud of calling her Sister.</P>

<P>It is pity he should besot himself so. Your Character of him encourages me to employ some La∣bour in advising him, to quit so beastly a Pleasure.—Come Gentlemen, I desire you would celebrate this Day at my House to-morrow. I will proceed to take

all possible Measures to your receiving Satisfaction for your Injuries, and making publick Example of so great a Villain: for the Crimes of a Magistrate give the greatest Sanction to Sin.</P>
