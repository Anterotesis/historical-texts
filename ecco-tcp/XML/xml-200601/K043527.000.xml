<HEAD>The CONTENTS of PART V.</HEAD>
<P>AUthor addresses the <HI>GODDESS</HI> of <HI>LIBERTY,</HI> marking the Happiness
and Grandeur of <HI>GREAT-BRITAIN,</HI> as arising from <HI>HER</HI> Influence;
to Ver. 88. <HI>SHE</HI> resumes <HI>HER</HI> Discourse, and points out the chief
<HI>VIRTUES</HI> which are necessary to maintain <HI>HER ESTABLISHMENT</HI> there;
to Ver. 374. Recommends, as <HI>IT'S</HI> last Ornament and Finishing, <HI>SCIENCES,</HI>
<HI>FINE ARTS,</HI> and <HI>PUBLIC WORKS.</HI> The Encouragement of These urged from
the Example of <HI>France,</HI> tho' under a Despotic Government; to Ver. 549.
The Whole concludes with a <HI>PROSPECT</HI> of future Times, given by the <HI>GODDESS</HI>
of <HI>LIBERTY</HI>: this described by the Author, as it passes in <HI>VISION</HI> before
him.</P>
