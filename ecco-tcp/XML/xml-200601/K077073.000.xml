<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Essay owes its origin to a conversation with a friend, on the subject of Mr. Godwin's Essay, on ava∣rice and profusion, in his Enquirer. The discussion, started the general question of the future improvement of society; and the Author at first sat down with an intention of merely stating his thoughts to his friend, upon paper, in a clearer manner than he thought he could do, in conversation. But as the subject opened upon him, some ideas occurred, which he did not recollect to have met with before; and as he conceived, that every, the least light, on a topic so generally interesting, might be received with can∣dour, he determined to put his thoughts in a form for publication.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
The essay might, undoubtedly, have been rendered much more complete by a collection of a greater number of facts in elucidation of the general argument. But a long and almost total interrup∣tion, from very particular business, joined to a desire (perhaps imprudent) of not delaying the publication much beyond the time that he originally proposed, prevented the Author from giving to the subject an undivided attention. He presumes, however, that the facts which he has adduced, will be found, to form no inconsiderable evidence for the truth of his opinion respecting the future im∣provement of mankind. As the Author contemplates this opinion at present, little more appears to him to be neces∣sary than a plain statement, in addition to the most cursory view of society, to establish it.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
It is an obvious truth, which has been taken notice of by many writers, that population must always be kept down to the level of the means of subsistence; but no writer, that the Author recollects, has inquired particularly into the means by which this level is effected: and it is a view of these means, which forms, to his mind, the strongest ob∣stacle in the way to any very great fu∣ture improvement of society. He hopes it will appear; that, in the discussion of this interesting subject, he is actuated solely by a love of truth; and not by any prejudices against any particular set of men, or of opinions. He professes to have read some of the speculations on the future improvement of society, in a temper very different from a wish to find them visionary; but he has not acquired that command over his understanding which would enable him to believe what
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
he wishes, without evidence, or to refuse his assent to what might be unpleasing, when accompanied with evidence.</P>
<P>The view which he has given of human life has a melancholy hue; but he feels conscious, that he has drawn these dark tints, from a conviction that they are really in the picture; and not from a jaundiced eye, or an inherent spleen of disposition. The theory of mind which he has sketched in the two last chapters, accounts to his own understanding, in a satisfactory manner, for the existence of most of the evils of life; but whether it will have the same effect upon others, must be left to the judgment of his readers.</P>
<P>If he should succeed in drawing the attention of more able men, to what he conceives to be the principal difficulty in
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
the way to the improvement of society, and should, in consequence, see this dif∣ficulty removed, even in theory, he will gladly retract his present opinions, and rejoice in a conviction of his error.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Question stated.—Little prospect of a determination of it, from the enmity of the opposing parties.—The prin∣cipal argument against the perfectibility of man and of society has never been fairly answered.—Nature of the difficulty arising from population.—Outline of the principal argument of the essay.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE great and unlooked for discoveries that have taken place of late years in natural philosophy; the increasing dif∣fusion of general knowledge from the ex∣tension of the art of printing; the ardent and unshackled spirit of inquiry that pre∣vails throughout the lettered, and even un∣lettered world; the new and extraordinary
<PB N="2" REF="18"/>
lights that have been thrown on political subjects, which dazzle, and astonish the understanding; and particularly that tre∣mendous phenomenon in the political horizon the French revolution, which, like a blazing comet, feems destined either to inspire with fresh life and vigour, or to scorch up and destroy the shrinking in∣habitants of the earth, have all concurred to lead many able men into the opinion, that we were touching on a period big with the most important changes, changes that would in some measure be decisive of the future fate of mankind.</P>
<P>It has been said, that the great question is now at issue, whether man shall hence∣forth start forwards with accelerated ve∣locity towards illimitable, and hitherto unconceived improvement; or be con∣demned to a perpetual oscillation between happiness and misery, and after every
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>
effort remain still at an immeasurable distance from the wished-for goal.</P>
<P>Yet, anxiously as every friend of man∣kind must look forwards to the termina∣tion of this painful suspense; and, eagerly as the inquiring mind would hail every ray of light that might assist its view into futurity, it is much to be lamented, that the writers on each side of this momentous question still keep far aloof from each other. Their mutual arguments do not meet with a candid examination. The question is not brought to rest on fewer points; and even in theory scarcely seems to be approaching to a decision.</P>
<P>The advocate for the present order of things, is apt to treat the sect of spe∣culative philosphers, either as a set of artful and designing knaves, who preach up ardent benevolence, and draw capti∣vating
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>
pictures of a happier state of so∣ciety, only the better to enable them to destroy the present establishments, and to forward their own deep-laid schemes of ambition: or, as wild and mad-headed enthusiasts, whose silly speculations, and absurd paradoxes, are not worthy the at∣tention of any reasonable man.</P>
<P>The advocate for the perfectibility of man, and of society, retorts on the de∣fender of establishments a more than equal contempt. He brands him as the slave of the most miserable, and narrow prejudices; or, as the defender of the abuses of civil society, only because he profits by them. He paints him either as a character who prostitutes his under∣standing to his interest; or as one whose powers of mind are not of a size to grasp any thing great and noble; who cannot see above five yards before him; and who
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>
must therefore be utterly unable to take in the views of the enlightened benefactor of mankind.</P>
<P>In this unamicable contest, the cause of truth cannot but suffer. The really good arguments on each side of the question are not allowed to have their proper weight. Each pursues his own theory, little soli∣citous to correct, or improve it, by an at∣tention to what is advanced by his op∣ponents.</P>
<P>The friend of the present order of things condemns all political speculations in the gross. He will not even condescend to examine the grounds from which the perfectibility of society is inferred. Much less will he give himself the trouble in a fair and candid manner to attempt an exposition of their fallacy.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="22"/>
The speculative philosopher equally offends against the cause of truth. With eyes fixed on a happier state of society, the blessings of which he paints in the most captivating colours, he allows him∣self to indulge in the most bitter in∣vectives against every present establish∣ment, without applying his talents to con∣sider the best and safest means of removing abuses, and without seeming to be aware of the tremendous obstacles that threaten, even in theory, to oppose the progress of man towards perfection.</P>
<P>It is an acknowledged truth in philo∣sophy, that a just theory will always be confirmed by experiment. Yet so much friction, and so many minute circum∣stances occur in practice, which it is next to impossible for the most enlarged and penetrating mind to foresee, that on few subjects can any theory be pronounced
<PB N="7" REF="23"/>
just, that has not stood the test of ex∣perience. But an untried theory cannot fairly be advanced as probable, much less as just, till all the arguments against it, have been maturely weighed, and clearly and consistently resuted.</P>
<P>I have read some of the speculations on the perfectibility of man and of society, with great pleasure. I have been warmed and delighted with the enchanting pic¦ture which they hold forth. I ardently wish for such happy improvements. But I see great, and, to my understanding, unconquerable difficulties in the way to them. These difficulties it is my present purpose to state; declaring, at the same time, that so far from exulting in them, as a cause of triumph over the friends of innovation, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see them completely re∣moved.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="24"/>
The most important argument that I shall adduce is certainly not new. The principles on which it depends have been explained in part by Hume, and more at large by Dr. Adam Smith. It has been advanced and applied to the present sub∣ject, though not with its proper weight, or in the most forcible point of view, by Mr. Wallace: and it may probably have been stated by many writers that I have never met with. I should certainly therefore not think of advancing it again, though I mean to place it in a point of view in some degree different from any that I have hitherto seen, if it had ever been fairly and satisfactorily answered.</P>
<P>The cause of this neglect on the part of the advocates for the perfectibility of man∣kind, is not easily accounted for. I cannot doubt the talents of such men as Godwin and Condorcet. I am unwilling to doubt their
<PB N="9" REF="25"/>
candour. To my understanding, and pro∣bably to that of most others, the difficulty appears insurmountable. Yet these men of acknowledged ability and penetration, scarcely deign to notice it, and hold on their course in such speculations, with unabated ardour, and undiminished con∣fidence. I have certainly no right to say that they purposely shut their eyes to such arguments. I ought rather to doubt the validity of them, when neglected by such men, however forcibly their truth may strike my own mind. Yet in this respect it must be acknowledged that we are all of us too prone to err. If I saw a glass of wine repeatedly presented to a man, and he took no notice of it, I should be apt to think that he was blind or uncivil. A juster philosophy might teach me rather to think that my eyes deceived me, and that the offer was not really what I con∣ceived it to be.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="26"/>
In entering upon the argument I must premise that I put out of the question, at present, all mere conjectures; that is, all suppositions, the probable realization of which cannot be inferred upon any just philosophical grounds. A writer may tell me that he thinks man will ultimately be∣come an ostrich. I cannot properly con∣tradict him. But before he can expect to bring any reasonable person over to his opinion, he ought to shew, that the neeks of mankind have been gradually elon∣gating; that the lips have grown harder, and more prominent; that the legs and feet are daily altering their shape; and that the hair is beginning to change into stubs of feathers. And till the probability of so wonderful a conversion can be shewn, it is surely lost time and lost eloquence to expatiate on the happiness of man in such a state; to describe his powers, both of running and flying; to paint him in
<PB N="11" REF="27"/>
a condition where all narrow luxuries would be contemned; where he would be employed only in collecting the neces∣saries of life; and where, consequently, each man's share of labour would be light, and his portion of leisure ample.</P>
<P>I think I may fairly make two postu∣lata.</P>
<P>First, That food is necessary to the existence of man.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the passion between the sexes is necessary, and will remain nearly in its present state.</P>
<P>These two laws ever since we have had any knowledge of mankind, appear to have been fixed laws of our nature; and, as we have not hitherto seen any alteration in them, we have no right
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>
to conclude that they will ever cease to be what they now are, without an immediate act of power in that Being who first arranged the system of the universe; and for the advantage of his creatures, still executes, according to fixed laws, all its various operations.</P>
<P>I do not know that any writer has supposed that on this earth man will ultimately be able to live without food. But Mr. Godwin has conjectured that the passion between the sexes may in time be extinguished. As, however, he calls this part of his work, a deviation into the land of conjecture, I will not dwell longer upon it at present, than to say, that the best arguments for the perfectibility of man, are drawn from a contemplation of the great progress that he has already made from the savage state, and the difficulty of saying where
<PB N="13" REF="29"/>
he is to stop. But towards the extinc∣tion of the passion between the sexes, no progress whatever has hitherto been made. It appears to exist in as much force at present as it did two thousand, or four thousand years ago. There are individual exceptions now as there al∣ways have been. But, as these excep∣tions do not appear to increase in num∣ber, it would surely be a very unphi∣losophical mode of arguing, to infer merely from the existence of an excep∣tion, that the exception would, in time, become the rule, and the rule the ex∣ception.</P>
<P>Assuming then, my postulata as granted, I say, that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="30"/>
Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence in∣creases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will shew the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second.</P>
<P>By that law of our nature which makes food necessary to the life of man, the effects of these two unequal powers must be kept equal.</P>
<P>This implies a strong and constantly operating check on population from the difficulty of subsistence. This difficulty must fall some where; and must neces∣sarily be severely felt by a large portion of mankind.</P>
<P>Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds
<PB N="15" REF="31"/>
of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand. She has been com∣paratively sparing in the room, and the nourishment necessary to rear them. The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that impe∣rious all pervading law of nature, res∣trains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants, and the race of animals shrink under this great restric∣tive law. And the race of man can∣not, by any efforts of reason, escape from it. Among plants and animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and premature death. Among mankind, misery and vice. The former, misery, is an absolutely necessary consequence of it. Vice is a highly probable con∣sequence, and we therefore see it abun∣dantly
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>
prevail; but it ought not, per∣haps, to be called an absolutely neces∣sary consequence. The ordeal of virtue is to resist all temptation to evil.</P>
<P>This natural inequality of the two powers of population, and of production in the earth, and that great law of our nature which must constantly keep their effects equal, form the great difficulty that to me appears insurmountable in the way to the perfectibility of society. All other arguments are of slight and subordinate consideration in comparison of this. I see no way by which man can es∣cape from the weight of this law which pervades all animated nature. No fan∣cied equality, no agrarian regulations in their utmost extent, could remove the pressure of it even for a single cen∣tury. And it appears, therefore, to be decisive against the possible existence of
<PB N="17" REF="33"/>
a society, all the members of which, should live in ease, happiness, and comparative leisure; and feel no anxiety about providing the means of subsist∣ence for themselves and families.</P>
<P>Consequently, if the premises are just, the argument is conclusive against the perfectibility of the mass of man∣kind.</P>
<P>I have thus sketched the general out∣line of the argument; but I will ex∣amine it more particularly; and I think it will be found that experience, the true source and foundation of all know∣ledge, invariably confirms its truth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The different ratios in which population and food in∣crease.—The necessary effects of these different ratios of increase.—Oscillation produced by them in the con∣dition of the lower classes of society.—Reasons why this oscillation has not been so much observed as might be expected.—Three propositions on which the general argument of the essay depends.—The different states in which mankind have been known to exist proposed to be examined with reference to these three pro∣positions.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I SAID that population, when un∣checked, increased in a geometrical ratio; and subsistence for man in an arithmetical ratio.</P>
<P>Let us examine whether this posi∣tion be just.</P>
<P>I think it will be allowed, that no state has hitherto existed (at least that we have any account of) where the
<PB N="19" REF="35"/>
manners were so pure and simple, and the means of subsistence so abundant, that no check whatever has existed to early marriages; among the lower classes, from a fear of not providing well for their families; or among the higher classes, from a fear of lowering their con∣dition in life. Consequently in no state that we have yet known, has the power of population been left to exert itself with perfect freedom.</P>
<P>Whether the law of marriage be in∣stituted, or not, the dictate of nature and virtue, seems to be an early attach∣ment to one woman. Supposing a liberty of changing in the case of an unfortu∣nate choice, this liberty would not affect population till it arose to a height greatly vicious; and we are now supposing the existence of a society where vice is scarcely known.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="36"/>
In a state therefore of great equality and virtue, where pure and simple man∣ners prevailed, and where the means of subsistence were so abundant, that no part of the society could have any fears about providing amply for a family, the power of population being left to exert itself unchecked, the increase of the human species would evidently be much greater than any increase that has been hitherto known.</P>
<P>In the United States of America, where the means of subsistence have been more ample, the manners of the people more pure, and consequently the checks to early marriages fewer, than in any of the modern states of Europe, the population has been found to double itself in twenty-five years.</P>
<P>This ratio of increase, though short of the utmost power of population, yet
<PB N="21" REF="37"/>
as the result of actual experience, we will take as our rule; and say,</P>
<P>That population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio.</P>
<P>Let us now take any spot of earth, this Island for instance, and see in what ratio the subsistence it affords can be supposed to increase. We will begin with it under its present state of culti∣vation.</P>
<P>If I allow that by the best possible policy, by breaking up more land, and by great encouragements to agriculture, the produce of this Island may be doubled in the first twenty-five years, I think it will be allowing as much as any person can well demand.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="38"/>
In the next twenty-five years, it is impossible to suppose that the produce could be quadrupled. It would be contrary to all our knowledge of the qualities of land. The very utmost that we can conceive, is, that the increase in the second twenty-five years might equal the present produce. Let us then take this for our rule, though certainly far beyond the truth; and allow that by great exertion, the whole produce of the Island might be increased every twenty-five years, by a quantity of subsistence equal to what it at present produces. The most enthusiastic speculator cannot suppose a greater increase than this. In a few centuries it would make every acre of land in the Island like a garden.</P>
<P>Yet this ratio of increase is evidently arithmetical.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="39"/>
It may be fairly said, therefore, that the means of subsistence increase in an arithmetical ratio.</P>
<P>Let us now bring the effects of these two ratios together.</P>
<P>The population of the Island is com∣puted to be about seven millions; and we will suppose the present produce equal to the support of such a number. In the first twenty-five years the popu∣lation would be fourteen millions; and the food being also doubled, the means of subsistence would be equal to this increase. In the next twenty-five years the population would be twenty-eight millions; and the means of subsistence only equal to the support of twenty-one millions. In the next period, the popu∣lation would be fifty-six millions, and the means of subsistence just sufficient for
<PB N="24" REF="40"/>
half that number. And at the conclu∣sion of the first century, the population would be one hundred and twelve mil∣lions, and the means of subsistence only equal to the support of thirty-five mil∣lions; which would leave a population of seventy-seven millions totally unprovided for.</P>
<P>A great emigration necessarily implies unhappiness of some kind or other in the country that is deserted. For few per∣sons will leave their families, connec∣tions, friends, and native land, to seek a settlement in untried foreign climes, without some strong subsisting causes of uneasiness where they are, or the hope of some great advantages in the place to which they are going.</P>
<P>But to make the argument more ge∣neral, and less interrupted by the par∣tial
<PB N="25" REF="41"/>
views of emigration, let us take the whole earth, instead of one spot, and suppose that the restraints to population were universally removed. If the sub∣sistence for man that the earth affords was to be increased every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what the whole world at present produces; this would allow the power of production in the earth to be absolutely unlimited, and its ratio of increase much greater than we can conceive that any possible exer∣tions of mankind could make it.</P>
<P>Taking the population of the world at any number, a thousand millions, for instance, the human species would in∣crease in the ratio of—1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, &amp;c. and sub∣sistence as—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c. In two centuries and a quarter, the population would be to the means of
<PB N="26" REF="42"/>
subsistence as 512 to 10: in three cen∣turies as 4096 to 13; and in two thou∣sand years the difference would be almost incalculable, though the produce in that time would have increased to an immense extent.</P>
<P>No limits whatever are placed to the productions of the earth; they may in∣crease for ever and be greater than any assignable quantity; yet still the power of population being a power of a superior order, the increase of the human species can only be kept commensurate to the increase of the means of subsistence, by the constant operation of the strong law of necessity acting as a check upon the greater power.</P>
<P>The effects of this check remain now to be considered.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="43"/>
Among plants and animals the view of the subject is simple. They are all im∣pelled by a powerful instinct to the in∣crease of their species; and this instinct is interrupted by no reasoning, or doubts about providing for their offspring. Wherever therefore there is liberty, the power of increase is exerted; and the superabundant effects are repressed after∣wards by want of room and nourishment, which is common to animals and plants; and among animals, by becoming the prey of others.</P>
<P>The effects of this check on man are more complicated.</P>
<P>Impelled to the increase of his species by an equally powerful instinct, reason interrupts his career, and asks him whether he may not bring beings into the world, for whom he cannot provide
<PB N="28" REF="44"/>
the means of subsistence. In a state of equality, this would be the simple ques∣tion. In the present state of society, other considerations occur. Will he not lower his rank in life? Will he not sub∣ject himself to greater difficulties than he at present feels? Will he not be obliged to labour harder? and if he has a large family, will his utmost exertions enable him to support them? May he not see his offspring in rags and misery, and elamouring for bread that he cannot give them? And may he not be reduced to the grating necessity of forfeiting his in∣dependence, and of being obliged to the sparing hand of charity for support?</P>
<P>These considerations are calculated to prevent, and certainly do prevent, a very great number in all civilized nations from pursuing the dictate of nature in an early attachment to one woman. And this
<PB N="29" REF="45"/>
restraint almost necessarily, though not absolutely so, produces vice. Yet in all societies, even those that are most vici∣ous, the tendency to a virtuous attach∣ment is so strong, that there is a con∣stant effort towards an increase of popu∣lation. This constant effort as constantly tends to subject the lower classes of the society to distress, and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition.</P>
<P>The way in which these effects are produced seems to be this.</P>
<P>We will suppose the means of sub∣sistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population, which is found to act even in the most vicious societies, increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are in∣creased.
<PB N="30" REF="46"/>
The food therefore which be∣fore supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor conse∣quently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of pro∣visions would at the same time tend to rife. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. Dur∣ing this season of distress, the discourage∣ments to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that popu∣lation is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an in∣creased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to
<PB N="31" REF="47"/>
manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.</P>
<P>This sort of oscillation will not be re∣marked by superficial observers; and it may be difficult even for the most pene∣trating mind to calculate its periods. Yet that in all old states some such vi∣bration does exist; though from various transverse causes, in a much less marked, and in a much more irregular manner than I have described it, no reflecting
<PB N="32" REF="48"/>
man who considers the subject deeply can well doubt.</P>
<P>Many reasons occur why this oscilla∣tion has been less obvious, and less de∣cidedly confirmed by experience, than might naturally be expected.</P>
<P>One principal reason is, that the his∣tories of mankind that we possess, are histories only of the higher classes. We have but few accounts that can be de∣pended upon of the manners and customs of that part of mankind, where these retrograde and progressive movements chiefly take place. A satisfactory his∣tory of this kind, of one people, and of one period, would require the constant and minute attention of an observing mind during a long life. Some of the objects of enquiry would be, in what proportion to the number of adults was
<PB N="33" REF="49"/>
the number of marriages: to what ex∣tent vicious customs prevailed in conse∣quence of the restraints upon matrimony: what was the comparative mortality among the children of the most distressed part of the community, and those who lived rather more at their ease: what were the variations in the real price of labour: and what were the observable differences in the state of the lower classes of society, with respect to ease and hap∣piness, at different times during a certain period.</P>
<P>Such a history would tend greatly to elucidate the manner in which the con∣stant check upon population acts; and would probably prove the existence of the retrograde and progressive move∣ments that have been mentioned; though the times of their vibration must neces∣sarily be rendered irregular, from the
<PB N="34" REF="50"/>
operation of many interrupting causes; such as, the introduction or failure of certain manufactures: a greater or less prevalent spirit of agricultural enterprize: years of plenty, or years of scarcity: wars and pestilence: poor laws: the in∣vention of processes for shortening labour without the proportional extension of the market for the commodity: and, par∣ticularly, the difference between the nominal and real price of labour; a cir∣cumstance, which has perhaps more than any other, contributed to conceal this oscillation from common view.</P>
<P>It very rarely happens that the nomi∣nal price of labour universally falls; but we well know that it frequently remains the same, while the nominal price of provisions has been gradually increasing. This is, in effect, a real fall in the price of labour; and during this
<PB N="35" REF="51"/>
period, the condition of the lower orders of the community must gradually grow worse and worse. But the farmers and capi∣talists are growing rich from the real cheap∣ness of labour. Their increased capitals en∣able them to employ a greater number of men. Work therefore may be plentiful; and the price of labour would conse∣quently rise. But the want of freedom in the market of labour, which occurs more or less in all communities, either from parish laws, or the more general cause of the facility of combination among the rich, and its difficulty among the poor, operates to prevent the price of labour from rising at the natural period, and keeps it down some time longer; perhaps, till a year of scarcity, when the clamour is too loud, and the necessity too apparent to be resisted.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="52"/>
The true cause of the advance in the price of labour is thus concealed; and the rich affect to grant it as an act of compassion and favour to the poor, in consideration of a year of scarcity; and when plenty returns, indulge themselves in the most unreasonable of all com∣plaints, that the price does not again fall; when a little reflection would shew them, that it must have risen long be∣fore, but from an unjust conspiracy of their own.</P>
<P>But though the rich by unfair combi∣nations, contribute frequently to prolong a season of distress among the poor; yet no possible form of society could pre∣vent the almost constant action of misery, upon a great part of mankind, if in a state of inequality, and upon all, if all were equal.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="53"/>
The theory, on which the truth of this position depends, appears to me so extremely clear; that I feel at a loss to conjecture what part of it can be de∣nied.</P>
<P>That population cannot increase with∣out the means of subsistence, is a propo∣sition so evident, that it needs no illus∣tration.</P>
<P>That population does invariably in∣crease, where there are the means of subsistence, the history of every people that have ever existed will abundantly prove.</P>
<P>And, that the superior power of population cannot be checked, without producing misery or vice, the ample portion of these too bitter ingredients in the cup of human life, and the con∣tinuance
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>
of the physical causes that seem to have produced them, bear too con∣vincing a testimony.</P>
<P>But in order more fully to ascertain the validity of these three propositions, let us examine the different states in which mankind have been known to exist. Even a cursory review will, I think, be sufficient to convince us, that these propositions are incontrovertible truths.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The savage or hunter state shortly reviewed.—The shep∣herd state, or the tribes of barbarians that overran the Roman Empire.—The superiority of the power of po∣pulation to the means of subsistence—the cause of the great tide of Northern Emigration.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the rudest state of mankind, in which hunting is the principal occu∣pation, and the only mode of acquiring food; the means of subsistence being scattered over a large extent of territory, the comparative population must necessa∣rily be thin. It is said, that the passion between the sexes is less ardent among the North American Indians, than among any other race of men. Yet notwithstanding this apathy, the effort towards population, even in this people, seems to be always greater than the means to support it. This appears, from
<PB N="40" REF="56"/>
the comparatively rapid population that takes place, whenever any of the tribes happen to settle in some fertile spot, and to draw nourishment from more fruitful sources than that of hunting; and it has been frequently remarked, that when an Indian family has taken up its abode near any European settle∣ment, and adopted a more easy and civilized mode of life, that one woman has reared five or six, or more children; though in the savage state, it rarely hap∣pens, that above one or two in a family grow up to maturity. The same obser∣vation has been made with regard to the Hottentots near the Cape. These facts prove the superior power of population to the means of subsistence in nations of hunters; and that this power always shews itself the moment it is left to act with freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="57"/>
It remains to inquire, whether this power can be checked, and its effects kept equal to the means of subsistence, without vice, or misery.</P>
<P>The North American Indians, consi∣dered as a people, cannot justly be called free and equal. In all the accounts we have of them, and, indeed, of most other savage nations, the women are represented as much more completely in a state of slavery to the men, than the poor are to the rich in civilized countries. One half the nation appears to act as Helots to the other half: and the misery that checks population falls chiefly, as it always must do, upon that part whose condition is lowest in the scale of society. The infancy of man in the simplest state requires considera∣ble attention; but this necessary atten∣tion the women cannot give, condemned
<PB N="42" REF="58"/>
as they are, to the inconveniences and hardships of frequent change of place, and to the constant and unre∣mitting drudgery of preparing every thing for the reception of their tyran∣nic lords. These exertions, sometimes, during pregnancy, or with children at their backs, must occasion frequent mis∣carriages, and prevent any but the most robust infants from growing to matu∣rity. Add to these hardships of the women, the constant war that prevails among savages, and the necessity which they frequently labour under of expo∣sing their aged and helpless parents, and of thus violating the first feelings of nature; and the picture will not ap∣pear very free from the blot of misery. In estimating the happiness of a savage nation, we must not fix our eyes only on the warrior in the prime of life: he is one of a hundred: he is the gentle∣man,
<PB N="43" REF="59"/>
the man of fortune, the chances have been in his favour; and many ef∣forts have failed ere this fortunate be∣ing was produced, whose guardian ge∣nius should preserve him through the numberless dangers with which he would be surrounded from infancy to manhood. The true points of comparison between two nations, seem to be, the ranks in each which appear nearest to answer to each other. And in this view, I should com∣pare the warriors in the prime of life, with the gentlemen; and the women, children, and aged, with the lower classes of the community in civilized states.</P>
<P>May we not then fairly infer from this short review, or rather, from the accounts that may be referred to of na∣tions of hunters; that their population is thin from the scarcity of food; that it would immediately increase if food
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>
was in greater plenty; and that, put∣ting vice out of the question among sa∣vages, misery is the check that represses the superior power of population, and keeps its effects equal to the means of subsistence. Actual observation and ex∣perience, tell us that this check, with a few local and temporary exceptions, is constantly acting now upon all sa∣vage nations; and the theory indicates, that it probably acted with nearly equal strength a thousand years ago, and it may not be much greater a thousand years hence.</P>
<P>Of the manners and habits that pre∣vail among nations of shepherds, the next state of mankind, we are even more ignorant than of the savage state. But that these nations could not escape the general lot of misery arising from the want of subsistence, Europe, and
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>
all the fairest countries in the world, bear ample testimony. Want was the goad that drove the Scythian shepherds from their native haunts, like so many famished wolves in search of prey. Set in motion by this all powerful cause, clouds of Barbarians seemed to collect from all points of the northern hemis∣phere. Gathering fresh darkness, and terror, as they rolled on, the congre∣gated bodies at length obscured the sun of Italy, and sunk the whole world in universal night. These tremendous ef∣fects, so long and so deeply felt through∣out the fairest portions of the earth, may be traced to the simple cause of the superior power of population, to the means of subsistence.</P>
<P>It is well known, that a country in pasture cannot support so many inha∣bitants as a country in tillage; but what
<PB N="46" REF="62"/>
renders nations of shepherds so formida∣ble, is, the power which they possess of moving all together, and the necessity they frequently feel of exerting this power in search of fresh pasture for their herds. A tribe that was rich in cattle, had an immediate plenty of food. Even the parent stock might be devoured in a case of absolute necessity. The wo∣men lived in greater ease than among nations of hunters. The men bold in their united strength, and confiding in their power of procuring pasture for their cattle by change of place, felt, probably, but few fears about providing for a family. These combined causes soon produced their natural and inva∣riable effect, an extended population. A more frequent and rapid change of place became then necessary. A wider and more extensive territory was successively occupied. A broader desolation extend∣ed
<PB N="47" REF="63"/>
all around them. Want pinched the less fortunate members of the society: and, at length, the impossibility of supporting such a number together be∣came too evident to be resisted. Young scions were then pushed out from the parent-stock, and instructed to explore fresh regions, and to gain happier seats for themselves by their swords. <Q>The world was all before them where to chuse.</Q> Restless from present distress; flushed with the hope of fairer pros∣pects; and animated with the spirit of hardy enterprize, these daring adventu∣rers were likely to become formidable adversaries to all who opposed them. The peaceful inhabitants of the coun∣tries on which they rushed, could not long withstand the energy of men acting under such powerful motives of exertion. And when they fell in with any tribes like their own, the contest was a
<PB N="48" REF="64"/>
struggle for existence; and they sought with a desperate courage, inspired by the reflection, that death was the punishment of defeat, and life the prize of victory.</P>
<P>In these savage contests many tribes must have been utterly exterminated. Some, probably, perished by hardship and famine. Others, whose leading star had given them a happier direction, became great and powerful tribes; and, in their turns, sent off fresh adventu∣rers in search of still more fertile seats. The prodigious waste of human life oc∣casioned by this perpetual struggle for room and food, was more than supplied by the mighty power of population, acting, in some degree, unshackled, from the constant habit of emigration. The tribes that migrated towards the South, though they won these more fruitful regions by continual battles, rapidly increased
<PB N="49" REF="65"/>
in number and power, from the in∣creased means of subsistence. Till, at length, the whole territory, from the confines of China to the shores of the Baltic, was peopled by a various race of Barbarians, brave, robust, and enter∣prising; inured to hardship, and delight∣ing in war. Some tribes maintained their independence. Others ranged them∣themselves under the standard of some barbaric chieftain, who led them to victory after victory; and what was of more importance, to regions abounding in corn, wine and oil, the long wished for consummation, and great reward of their labours. An Alaric, an Attila or a Zingis Khan, and the chiefs around them, might fight for glory, for the same of extensive conquests; but the true cause that set in motion the great tide of northern emigration, and that continued to propel it till it rolled at
<PB N="50" REF="66"/>
different periods, against China, Persia, Italy, and even Egypt, was a scarcity of food, a population extended beyond the means of supporting it.</P>
<P>The absolute population at any one period, in proportion to the extent of territory, could never be great, on ac∣count of the unproductive nature of some of the regions occupied: but there appears to have been a most rapid suc∣cession of human beings; and as fast as some were moved down by the scythe of war, or of famine, others rose in in∣creased numbers to supply their place. Among these bold and improvident Bar∣barians, population was probably but little checked, as in modern states, from a fear of future difficulties. A prevail∣ing hope of bettering their condition by change of place; a constant expec∣tation of plunder; a power even, if
<PB N="51" REF="67"/>
distressed, of selling their children as slaves, added to the natural carelessness of the barbaric character, all conspired to raise a population which remained to be repressed afterwards by famine or war.</P>
<P>Where there is any inequality of con∣ditions, and among nations of shep∣herds this soon takes place, the distress arising from a scarcity of provisions, must fall hardest upon the least fortu∣nate members of the society. This dis∣tress also must frequently have been felt by the women, exposed to casual plunder in the absence of their hus∣bands, and subject to continual disap∣pointments in their expected return.</P>
<P>But without knowing enough of the minute and intimate history of these people, to point out precisely on what
<PB N="52" REF="68"/>
part the distress for want of food chiefly fell; and to what extent it was generally felt; I think we may fairly say, from all the accounts that we have of nations of shep∣herds, that population invariably increased among them, whenever, by emigration, or any other cause, the means of sub∣sistence were increased; and, that a fur∣ther population was checked, and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence by misery and vice.</P>
<P>For, independently of any vicious cus∣toms that might have prevailed amongst them with regard to women, which al∣ways operate as checks to population, it must be acknowledged, I think, that the commission of war is vice, and the ef∣fect of it, misery; and none can doubt the misery of want of food.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>State of civilized nations.—Probability that Europe is much more populous now than in the time of Julius Caesar.—Best criterion of population.—Probable error of Hume in one of the criterions that he proposes as as∣sisting in an estimate of population.—Slow increase of population at present in most of the states of Europe.—The two principal checks to population. The first or preven∣tive check examined with regard to England.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN examining the next state of man∣kind with relation to the question be∣fore us, the state of mixed pasture and tillage, in which, with some variation in the proportions, the most civilized nations must always remain; we shall be assisted in our review by what we daily see around us, by actual experience, by facts that come within the scope of every man's observation.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the exaggerations of some old historians, there can remain
<PB N="54" REF="70"/>
no doubt in the mind of any thinking man, that the population of the princi∣pal countries of Europe, France, Eng∣land, Germany, Russia, Poland, Sweden, and Denmark, is much greater than ever it was in former times. The ob∣vious reason of these exaggerations, is, the formidable aspect that even a thinly peopled nation must have, when col∣lected together, and moving all at once in search of fresh seats. If to this tre∣mendous appearance be added a suc∣cession at certain intervals of similar emigrations, we shall not be much sur∣prised that the fears of the timid na∣tions of the South, represented the North as a region absolutely swarming with human beings. A nearer and juster view of the subject at present, enables us to see, that the inference was as absurd, as if a man in this country, who was continually meeting on the
<PB N="55" REF="71"/>
road droves of cattle from Wales and the North, was immediately to conclude that these countries were the most pro∣ductive of all the parts of the king∣dom.</P>
<P>The reason that the greater part of Europe is more populous now than it was in former times, is, that the indus∣try of the inhabitants has made these countries produce a greater quantity of human subsistence. For, I conceive, that it may be laid down as a position not to be controverted, that, taking a suf∣ficient extent of territory to include within it exportation and importation; and allowing some variation for the prevalence of luxury, or of frugal habits; that population constantly bears a regu∣lar proportion to the food that the earth is made to produce. In the contro∣versy concerning the populousness of an∣cient
<PB N="56" REF="72"/>
and modern nations, could it be clearly ascertained that the average pro∣duce of the countries in question, taken altogether, is greater now than it was in the times of Julius Caesar, the dis∣pute would be at once determined.</P>
<P>When we are assured that China is the most fertile country in the world; that almost all the land is in tillage; and that a great part of it bears two crops every year; and further, that the people live very frugally, we may infer with certainty, that the population must be immense, without busying ourselves in inquiries into the manners and ha∣bits of the lower classes, and the encou∣ragements to early marriages. But these inquiries, are of the utmost importance, and a minute history of the customs of the lower Chinese would be of the greatest use, in ascertaining in what
<PB N="57" REF="73"/>
manner the checks to a further popu∣lation operate; what are the vices, and what are the distresses that prevent an increase of numbers beyond the ability of the country to support.</P>
<P>Hume, in his essay on the populous∣ness of ancient and modern nations, when he intermingles, as he says, an in∣quiry concerning causes, with that con∣cerning facts, does not seem to see with his usual penetration, how very little some of the causes he alludes to could enable him to form any judgment of the actual population of ancient nations. If any inference can be drawn from them, perhaps it should be directly the reverse of what Hume draws, though I certainly ought to speak with great dis∣sidence in dissenting from a man, who of all others on such subjects was the least likely to be deceived by first appear∣ances.
<PB N="58" REF="74"/>
If I find that at a certain pe∣riod in ancient history, the encourage∣ments to have a family were great, that early marriages were consequently very prevalent, and that few persons remain∣ed single, I should infer with certainty that population was rapidly increasing, but by no means that it was then ac∣tually very great; rather, indeed, the contrary, that it was then thin, and that there was room and food for a much greater number. On the other hand, if I find that at this period the difficulties attending a family were very great; that, consequently, few early marriages took place, and that a great number of both sexes remained single, I infer with certainty that population was at a stand; and, probably, because the actual popu∣lation was very great in proportion to the fertility of the land, and that there was scarcely room and food for more.
<PB N="59" REF="75"/>
The number of footmen, housemaids, and other persons remaining unmarried in modern states, Hume allows to be ra∣ther an argument against their popula∣tion. I should rather draw a contrary inference, and consider it an argument of their fullness; though this inference is not certain, because there are many thinly inhabited states that are yet sta∣tionary in their population. To speak, therefore, correctly, perhaps it may be said, that the number of unmarried per∣sons in proportion to the whole num∣ber, existing at different periods, in the same, or different states, will enable us to judge whether population at these periods, was increasing, stationary, or de∣creasing, but will form no criterion by which we can determine the actual po∣pulation.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="76"/>
There is, however, a circumstance taken notice of in most of the accounts we have of China, that it seems difficult to reconcile with this reasoning. It is said, that early marriages very generally prevail through all the ranks of the Chinese. Yet Dr. Adam Smith sup∣poses that population in China is sta∣tionary. These two circumstances ap∣pear to be irreconcileable. It certainly seems very little probable that the po∣pulation of China is fast increasing. Every acre of land has been so long in cultivation, that we can hardly con∣ceive there is any great yearly addition to the average produce. The fact, per∣haps, of the universality of early mar∣riages may not be sufficiently ascer∣tained. If it be supposed true, the only way of accounting for the diffi∣culty, with our present knowledge of the subject, appears to be, that the redun∣dant
<PB N="61" REF="77"/>
population, necessarily occasioned by the prevalence of early marriages, must be repressed by occasional famines, and by the custom of exposing chil∣dren, which, in times of distress, is pro∣bably more frequent than is ever ac∣knowledged to Europeans. Relative to this barbarous practice, it is difficult to avoid remarking, that there cannot be a stronger proof of the distresses that have been felt by mankind for want of food, than the existence of a custom that thus violates the most natural principle of the human heart. It appears to have been very general among ancient na∣tions, and certainly tended rather to in∣crease population.</P>
<P>In examining the principal states of modern Europe, we shall find, that though they have increased very con∣siderably in population since they were
<PB N="62" REF="78"/>
nations of shepherds, yet that, at pre∣sent, their progress is but slow; and instead of doubling their numbers every twenty∣five years, they require three or four hundred years, or more, for that pur∣pose. Some, indeed, may be absolutely stationary, and others even retrograde. The cause of this slow progress in po∣pulation cannot be traced to a decay of the passion between the sexes. We have sufficient reason to think that this natural propensity exists still in undimi∣nished vigour. Why then do not its effects appear in a rapid increase of the human species? An intimate view of the state of society in any one coun∣try in Europe, which may serve equally for all, will enable us to answer this question, and to say, that a foresight of the difficulties attending the rearing of a family, acts as a preventive check; and the actual distresses of some of the
<PB N="63" REF="79"/>
lower classes, by which they are dis∣abled from giving the proper food and attention to their children, acts as a po∣sitive check, to the natural increase of population.</P>
<P>England, as one of the most flourishing states of Europe, may be fairly taken for an example, and the observations made, will apply with but little varia∣tion to any other country where the population increases slowly.</P>
<P>The preventive check appears to ope∣rate in some degree through all the ranks of society in England. There are some men, even in the highest rank, who are prevented from marrying by the idea of the expences that they must retrench, and the fancied pleasures that they must deprive themselves of, on the supposition of having a family. These
<PB N="64" REF="80"/>
considerations are certainly trivial; but a preventive foresight of this kind has objects of much greater weight for its contemplation as we go lower.</P>
<P>A man of liberal education, but with an income only just sufficient to enable him to associate in the rank of gentle∣men, must feel absolutely certain, that if he marries and has a family, he shall be obliged, if he mixes at all in society, to rank himself with moderate farmers, and the lower class of trades∣men. The woman that a man of edu∣cation would naturally make the object of his choice, would be one brought up in the same tastes and sentiments with himself, and used to the familiar intercourse of a society totally different from that to which she must be re∣duced by marriage. Can a man con∣sent to place the object of his affec∣tion
<PB N="65" REF="81"/>
in a situation so discordant, proba∣bly, to her tastes and inclinations? Two or three steps of descent in so∣ciety, particularly at this round of the ladder, where education ends, and igno∣rance begins, will not be considered by the generality of people, as a fan∣cied and chimerical, but a real and es∣sential evil. If society be held desirea∣ble, it surely must be free, equal, and reciprocal society, where benefits are conferred as well as received; and not such as the dependent finds with his patron, or the poor with the rich.</P>
<P>These considerations undoubtedly pre∣vent a great number in this rank of life from following the bent of their in∣clinations in an early attachment. Others, guided either by a stronger passion, or a weaker judgment, break through these restraints; and it would be hard indeed,

if the gratification of so delightful a passion as virtuous love, did not, some∣times, more than counterbalance all its attendant evils. But I fear it must be owned, that the more general conse∣quences of such marriages, are rather calculated to justify, than to repress, the forebodings of the prudent.</P>
<P>The sons of tradesmen and farmers are exhorted not to marry, and generally find it necessary to pursue this advice, till they are settled in some business, or farm, that may enable them to sup∣port a family. These events may not, perhaps, occur till they are far advanced in life. The scarcity of farms is a very general complaint in England. And the competition in every kind of business is so great, that it is not possible that all should be successful.</P>

The labourer who earns eighteen pence a day, and lives with some degree of comfort as a single man, will hesi∣tate a little before he divides that pit∣tance among four or five, which seems to be but just sufficient for one. Harder fare and harder labour he would sub∣mit to, for the sake of living with the woman that he loves; but he must feel conscious, if he thinks at all, that, should he have a large family, and any ill luck whatever, no degree of fruga∣lity, no possible exertion of his manual strength, could preserve him from the heart rending sensation of seeing his children starve, or of forfeiting his inde∣pendence, and being obliged to the pa∣rish for their support. The love of in∣dependence is a sentiment that surely none would wish to be erased from the breast of man: though the parish law of England, it must be confessed, is a
<PB N="68" REF="84"/>
system of all others the most calculated gradually to weaken this sentiment, and in the end, may eradicate it com∣pletely.</P>
<P>The servants who live in gentlemens' families, have restraints that are yet stronger to break through, in venturing upon marriage. They possess the neces∣saries, and even the comforts of life, almost in as great plenty as their mas∣ters. Their work is easy, and their food luxurious, compared with the class of labourers. And their sense of depen∣dence is weakened by the conscious power of changing their masters, if they feel themselves offended. Thus com∣fortably situated at present, what are their prospects in marrying. Without knowledge or capital, either for business, or farming, and unused, and therefore
<PB N="69" REF="85"/>
unable to earn a subsistence by daily labour, their only refuge seems to be a miserable alehouse, which certainly offers no very enchanting prospect of a happy evening to their lives. By much the greater part, therefore, de∣terred by this uninviting view of their future situation, content themselves with remaining single where they are.</P>
<P>If this sketch of the state of society in England be near the truth, and I do not conceive that it is exaggerated, it will be allowed, that the preventive check to population in this country operates, though with varied force, through all the classes of the commu∣nity. The same observation will hold true with regard to all old states. The effects, indeed, of these restraints upon marriage are but too conspicuous in the
<PB N="70" REF="86"/>
consequent vices that are produced in almost every part of the world; vices, that are continually involving both sexes in inextricable unhappiness.</P>

<P>The second, or positive check to population examined, in England.—The true cause why the immense sum col∣lected in England for the poor does not better their con∣dition.—The powerful tendency of the poor laws to de∣feat their own purpose.—Palliative of the distresses of the poor proposed.—The absolute impossibility from the fixed laws of our nature, that the pressure of want can ever be completely removed from the lower classes of so∣ciety.—All the checks to population may be resolved into misery or vice.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE positive check to population, by which I mean, the check that represses an increase which is already begun, is confined chiefly, though not perhaps solely, to the lowest orders of society. This check is not so obvious to common view as the other I have mentioned; and, to prove distinctly the force and extent of its operation, would require, perhaps, more data than we are in pos∣session of. But I believe it has been
<PB N="72" REF="88"/>
very generally remarked by those who have attended to hills of mortality, that of the number of children who die an∣nually, much too great a proportion belongs to those, who may be supposed unable to give their offspring proper food and attention; exposed as they are occasionally to severe distress, and confined, perhaps, to unwholesome ha∣bitations and hard labour. This mor∣tality among the children of the poor has been constantly taken notice of in all towns. It certainly does not pre∣vail in an equal degree in the country; but the subject has not hitherto received sufficient attention to enable any one to say, that there are not more deaths in proportion, among the children of the poor, even in the country, than among those of the middling and higher classes. Indeed, it seems difficult to sup∣pose that a labourer's wife who has six
<PB N="73" REF="89"/>
children, and who is sometimes in abso∣lute want of bread, should be able al∣ways to give them the food and atten∣tion necessary to support life. The sons and daughters of peasants will not be found such rosy cherubs in real life, as they are described to be in romances. It cannot fail to be remarked by those who live much in the country, that the sons of labourers are very apt to be stunted in their growth, and are a long while arriving at maturity. Boys that you would guess to be fourteen or fif∣teen, are upon inquiry, frequently found to be eighteen or nineteen. And the lads who drive plough, which must cer∣tainly be a healthy exercise, are very rarely seen with any appearance of calves to their legs; a circumstance, which can only be attributed to a want either of proper, or of sufficient nourishment.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="90"/>
To remedy the frequent distresses of the common people, the poor laws of England have been instituted; but it is to be feared, that though they may have alleviated a little the intensity of indi∣vidual misfortune, they have spread the general evil over a much larger surface. It is a subject often started in conver∣sation, and mentioned always as a mat∣ter of great surprise, that notwithstand∣ing the immense sum that is annually collected for the poor in England, there is still so much distress among them. Some think that the money must be embezzled; others that the church∣wardens and overseers consume the greater part of it in dinners. All agree that some how or other it must be very ill∣managed. In short the fact, that nearly three millions are collected annually for the poor, and yet that their dis∣tresses are not removed, is the subject
<PB N="75" REF="91"/>
of continual astonishment. But a man who sees a little below the surface of things, would be very much more astonished, if the fact were otherwise than it is ob∣served to be, or even if a collection universally of eighteen shillings in the pound instead of four, were materially to alter it. I will state a case which I hope will elucidate my meaning.</P>
<P>Suppose, that by a subscription of the rich, the eighteen pence a day which men earn now, was made up five shil∣lings, it might be imagined, perhaps, that they would then be able to live comfortably, and have a piece of meat every day for their dinners. But this would be a very false conclusion. The transfer of three shillings and sixpence a day to every labourer, would not in∣crease the quantity of meat in the coun∣try. There is not at present enough
<PB N="76" REF="92"/>
for all to have a decent share. What would then be the consequence? The competition among the buyers in the market of meat, would rapidly raise the price from six pence or seven pence, to two or three shillings in the pound; and the commodity would not be di∣vided among many more than it is at present. When an article is scarce, and cannot be distributed to all, he that can shew the most valid patent, that is, he that offers most money becomes the possessor. If we can suppose the com∣petition among the buyers of meat to continue long enough for a greater num∣ber of cattle to be reared annually, this could only be done at the expence of the corn, which would be a very disadvantageous exchange; for it is well known that the country could not then support the same population; and when subsistence is scarce in proportion to the
<PB N="77" REF="93"/>
number of people, it is of little conse∣quence whether the lowest members of the society possess eighteen pence or five shillings. They must at all events be reduced to live upon the hardest fare, and in the smallest quantity.</P>
<P>It will be said, perhaps, that the in∣creased number of purchasers in every article, would give a spur to produc∣tive industry, and that the whole pro∣duce of the island would be increased. This might in some degree be the case. But the spur that these fancied riches would give to population, would more than counterbalance it, and the increased produce would be to be di∣vided among a more than proportion∣ably increased number of people. All this time I am supposing that the same quantity of work would be done as be∣fore. But this would not really take
<PB N="78" REF="94"/>
place. The receipt of five shillings a day, instead of eighteen pence, would make every man fancy himself compa∣ratively rich, and able to indulge him∣self in many hours or days of leisure. This would give a strong and imme∣diate check to productive industry; and in a short time, not only the nation would be poorer, but the lower classes themselves would be much more dis∣tressed than when they received only eighteen pence a day.</P>
<P>A collection from the rich of eighteen shillings in the pound, even if distri∣buted in the most judicious manner, would have a little the same effect as that resulting from the supposition I have just made; and no possible con∣tributions or sacrifices of the rich, par∣ticularly in money, could for any time prevent the recurrence of distress among
<PB N="79" REF="95"/>
the lower members of society whoever they were. Great changes might, in∣deed, be made. The rich might become poor, and some of the poor rich: but a part of the society must necessarily feel a difficulty of living; and this difficulty will naturally fall on the least fortunate members.</P>
<P>It may at first appear strange, but I believe it is true, that I cannot by means of money raise a poor man, and enable him to live much better than he did before, without proportionably depressing others in the same class. If I retrench the quantity of food con∣sumed in my house, and give him what I have cut off, I then benefit him, without depressing any but myself and family, who, perhaps, may be well able to bear it. If I turn up a piece of uncultivated land, and give him the produce, I then
<PB N="80" REF="96"/>
benefit both him, and all the members of the society, because what he before consumed is thrown into the common stock, and probably some of the new produce with it. But if I only give him money, supposing the produce of the country to remain the same, I give him a title to a larger share of that produce than formerly, which share he cannot receive without diminishing the shares of others. It is evident that this effect, in individual instances, must be so small as to be totally impercep∣tible; but still it must exist, as many other effects do, which like some of the insects that people the air, elude our grosser perceptions.</P>
<P>Supposing the quantity of food in any country to remain the same for many years together; it is evident that this food must be divided according to the
<PB N="81" REF="97"/>
value of each man's patent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Godwin calls the wealth that a man re∣ceives from his ancestors a mouldy patent. It may, I think, very properly be termed a patent; but I hardly see the propriety of calling it a mouldy one, as it is an article in such constant use.</NOTE>, or the sum of money that he can afford to spend in this commodity so universally in request. It is a demonstrative truth therefore, that the patents of one set of men could not be increased in value, without diminish∣ing the value of the patents of some other set of men. If the rich were to subscribe, and give five shillings a day to five hundred thousand men without retrenching their own tables, no doubt can exist, that as these men would naturally live more at their ease, and consume a greater quantity of provisions, there would be less food remaining to divide among the rest; and consequently each man's patent would be diminished
<PB N="82" REF="98"/>
in value, or the same number of pieces of silver would purchase a smaller quan∣tity of subsistence.</P>
<P>An increase of population without a proportional increase of food, will evi∣dently have the same effect in lowering the value of each man's patent. The food must necessarily be distributed in smaller quantities, and consequently a day's labour will purchase a smaller quan∣tity of provisions. An increase in the price of provisions would arise, either from an increase of population faster than the means of subsistence; or from a different distribution of the money of the society. The food of a country that has been long occupied, if it be in∣creasing, increases slowly and regularly, and cannot be made to answer any sud∣den demands; but variations in the dis∣tribution of the money of a society are
<PB N="83" REF="99"/>
not unfrequently occurring, and are un∣doubtedly among the causes that occa∣sion the continual variations which we observe in the price of provisions.</P>
<P>The poor-laws of England tend to de∣press the general condition of the poor in these two ways. Their first obvious tendency is to increase population with∣out increasing the food for its support. A poor man may marry with little or no prospect of being able to support a family in independence. They may be said therefore in some measure to create the poor which they maintain; and as the provisions of the country must, in consequence of the increased population, be distributed to every man in smaller proportions, it is evident that the labour of those who are not supported by parish assistance, will purchase a smaller quan∣tity of provisions than before, and con∣sequently
<PB N="84" REF="100"/>
more of them must be driven to ask for support.</P>
<P>Secondly, the quantity of provisions consumed in workhouses upon a part of the society, that cannot in general be considered as the most valuable part, diminishes the shares that would other∣wise belong to more industrious, and more worthy members; and thus in the same manner forces more to become de∣pendent. If the poor in the workhouses were to live better than they now do, this new distribution of the money of the society would tend more con∣spicuously to depress the condition of those out of the workhouses, by occasion∣ing a rise in the price of provisions.</P>
<P>Fortunately for England, a spirit of independence still remains among the peasantry. The poor-laws are strongly
<PB N="85" REF="101"/>
calculated to eradicate this spirit. They have succeeded in part; but had they succeeded as completely as might have been expected, their pernicious tendency would not have been so long concealed.</P>
<P>Hard as it may appear in individual instances, dependent poverty ought to be held disgraceful. Such a stimulus seems to be absolutely necessary to pro∣mote the happiness of the great mass of mankind; and every general attempt to weaken this stimulus, however benevo∣lent its apparent intention, will always defeat its own purpose. If men are in∣duced to marry from a prospect of parish provision, with little or no chance of maintaining their families in indepen∣dence, they are not only unjustly tempt∣ed to bring unhappiness and dependence upon themselves and children; but they are tempted, without knowing it, to injure all in the same class with them∣selves.
<PB N="86" REF="102"/>
A labourer who marries without being able to support a family, may in some respects be considered as an enemy to all his fellow-labourers.</P>
<P>I feel no doubt whatever, that the parish laws of England have contributed to raise the price of provisions, and to lower the real price of labour. They have there∣fore contributed to impoverish that class of people whose only possession is their labour. It is also difficult to suppose that they have not powerfully contributed to generate that carelesness, and want of frugality observable among the poor, so contrary to the disposition frequently to be re∣marked among petty tradesmen and small farmers. The labouring poor, to use a vulgar expression, seem always to live from hand to mouth. Their present wants employ their whole attention, and they seldom think of the future. Even when they have an opportunity of saving
<PB N="87" REF="103"/>
they seldom exercise it; but all that is beyond their present necessities goes, generally speaking, to the ale-house. The poor-laws of England may therefore be said to diminish both the power and the will to save, among the common people, and thus to weaken one of the strongest incentives to sobriety and indus∣try, and consequently to happiness.</P>
<P>It is a general complaint among master manufacturers, that high wages ruin all their workmen; but it is difficult to con∣ceive that these men would not save a part of their high wages for the future support of their families, instead of spend∣ing it in drunkenness and dissipation, if they did not rely on parish assistance for support in case of accidents. And that the poor employed in manufactures con∣sider this assistance as a reason why they may spend all the wages they earn, and
<PB N="88" REF="104"/>
enjoy themselves while they can, ap∣pears to be evident from the number of families that, upon the failure of any great manufactory, immediately fall upon the parish; when perhaps the wages earned in this manufactory, while it flourished, were sufficiently above the price of common country labour, to have allowed them to save enough for their support, till they could find some other channel for their industry.</P>
<P>A man who might not be deterred from going to the ale-house, from the consideration that on his death, or sick∣ness, he should leave his wife and family upon the parish, might yet hesitate in thus dissipating his earnings, if he were assured that, in either of these cases, his family must starve, or be left to the support of casual bounty. In China, where the real as well as nominal price of labour is
<PB N="89" REF="105"/>
very low, sons are yet obliged by law to support their aged and helpless parents. Whether such a law would be adviseable in this country, I will not pretend to determine. But it seems at any rate highly improper, by positive institutions, which render dependent poverty so ge∣neral, to weaken that disgrace, which for the best and most humane reasons ought to attach to it.</P>
<P>The mass of happiness among the com∣mon people cannot but be diminished, when one of the strongest checks to idel∣ness and dissipation is thus removed; and when men are thus allured to marry with little or no prospect of being able to maintain a family in independence. Every obstacle in the way of marriage must undoubtedly be considered as a spe¦cies of unhappiness. But as from the laws of our nature some check to popu∣lation
<PB N="90" REF="106"/>
must exist, it is better that it should be checked from a foresight of the difficulties attending a family, and the fear of dependent poverty, than that it should be encouraged, only to be re∣pressed afterwards by want and sick∣ness.</P>
<P>It should be remembered always, that there is an essential difference between food, and those wrought commodities, the raw materials of which are in great plenty. A demand for these last will not fail to create them in as great a quantity as they are wanted. The de∣mand for food has by no means the same creative power. In a country where all the fertile spots have been seized, high offers are necessary to encourage the farmer to lay his dressing on land, from which he cannot expect a profitable re∣turn for some years. And before the
<PB N="91" REF="107"/>
prospect of advantage is sufficiently great to encourage this sort of agricultural en∣terprize, and while the new produce is rising, great distresses may be suffered from the want of it. The demand for an increased quantity of subsistence is, with few exceptions, constant every where, yet we see how slowly it is an∣swered in all those countries that have been long occupied.</P>
<P>The poor-laws of England were un∣doubtedly instituted for the most benevo∣lent purpose; but there is great reason to think that they have not succeeded in their intention. They certainly mitigate some cases of very severe distress which might otherwise occur; yet the state of the poor who are supported by parishes, considered in all its circumstances, is very far from being free from misery. But one of the principal objections to
<PB N="92" REF="108"/>
them is, that for this assistance which some of the poor receive, in itself almost a doubtful blessing, the whole class of the common people of England, is sub∣jected to a set of grating, inconvenient, and tyrannical laws, totally inconsistent with the genuine spirit of the constitu∣tion. The whole business of settlements, even in its present amended state, is utterly contradictory to all ideas of free∣dom. The parish persecution of men whose families are likely to become chargeable, and of poor women who are near lying-in, is a most disgraceful and disgusting tyranny. And the obstruc∣tions continually occasioned in the mar∣ket of labour by these laws, have a con∣stant tendency to add to the difficulties of those who are struggling to support themselves without assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="109"/>
These evils attendant on the poor-laws, are in some degree irremediable. If assist∣ance be to be distributed to a certain class of people, a power must be given some∣where of discriminating the proper ob∣jects, and of managing the concerns of the institutions that are necessary; but any great interference with the affairs of other people, is a species of tyranny; and in the common course of things, the exercise of this power may be expected to become grating to those who are driven to ask for support. The tyranny of Justices, Churchwardens, and Over∣seers, is a common complaint among the poor: but the fault does not lie so much in these persons, who probably before they were in power, were not worse than other people; but in the nature of all such institutions.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="110"/>
The evil is perhaps gone too far to be remedied; but I feel little doubt in my own mind, that if the poor-laws had never existed, though there might have been a few more instances of very severe distress, yet that the aggregate mass of happiness among the common people would have been much greater than it is at present.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt's Poor-bill has the appearance of being framed with benevolent inten∣tions, and the clamour raised against it was in many respects ill directed, and unreasonable. But it must be confessed that it possesses in a high degree the great and radical defect of all systems of the kind, that, of tending to increase population without increasing the means for its support, and thus to depress the condition of those that are not supported
<PB N="95" REF="111"/>
by parishes, and, consequently, to create more poor.</P>
<P>To remove the wants of the lower classes of society, is indeed an arduous task. The truth is, that the pressure of distress on this part of a community is an evil so deeply seated, that no human ingenuity can reach it. Were I to pro∣pose a palliative; and palliatives are all that the nature of the case will admit; it should be, in the first place, the total abolition of all the present parish-laws. This would at any rate give liberty and freedom of action to the peasantry of England, which they can hardly be said to possess at present. They would then be able to settle without interruption, wherever there was a prospect of a greater plenty of work, and a higher price for labour. The market of labour would then be free, and those obstacles remov∣ed,
<PB N="96" REF="112"/>
which as things are now, often for a considerable time prevent the price from rising according to the demand.</P>
<P>Secondly, Premiums might be given for turning up fresh land, and all possible encouragements held out to agriculture above manufactures, and to tillage above grazing. Every endeavour should be used to weaken and destroy all those institu∣tions relating to corporations, apprentice∣ships, &amp;c. which cause the labours of agriculture to be worse paid than the labours of trade and manufactures. For a country can never produce its proper quantity of food while these distinctions remain in favour of artizans. Such en∣couragements to agriculture would tend to furnish the market with an increasing quantity of healthy work, and at the same time, by augmenting the produce of the country, would raise the compara∣tive
<PB N="97" REF="113"/>
price of labour, and ameliorate the condition of the labourer. Being now in better circumstances, and seeing no prospect of parish assistance, he would be more able, as well as more inclined, to enter into associations for providing against the sickness of himself or fa∣mily.</P>
<P>Lastly, for cases of extreme distress, county workhouses might be established, supported by rates upon the whole king∣dom, and free for persons of all counties, and indeed of all nations. The fare should be hard, and those that were able obliged to work. It would be desireable, that they should not be considered as comfortable asylums in all difficulties; but merely as places where severe distress might find some alleviation. A part of these houses might be separated, or others built for a most beneficial pur∣pose,
<PB N="98" REF="114"/>
which has not been unfrequently taken notice of, that of providing a place, where any person, whether native or foreigner, might do a day's work at all times, and receive the market price for it. Many cases would undoubtedly be left for the exertion of individual bene∣volence.</P>
<P>A plan of this kind, the prelimi∣nary of which, should be an abolition of all the present parish laws, seems to be the best calculated to increase the mass of happiness among the common people of England. To prevent the recurrence of misery, is, alas! beyond the power of man. In the vain endeavour to attain what in the nature of things is impossible, we now sacrifice not only possible, but certain benefits. We tell the common people, that if they will submit to a code of tyrannical regulations, they shall
<PB N="99" REF="115"/>
never be in want. They do submit to these regulations. They perform their part of the contract: but we do not, nay cannot, perform ours: and thus the poor sacrifice the valuable blessing of liberty, and receive nothing that can be called an equivalent in return.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding then, the institution of the poor-laws in England, I think it will be allowed, that considering the state of the lower classes altogether, both in the towns and in the country, the distresses which they suffer from the want of proper and sufficient food, from hard labour and unwholesome habitations, must operate as a constant check to incipient population.</P>
<P>To these two great checks to popula∣tion, in all long occupied countries, which I have called the preventive and
<PB N="100" REF="116"/>
the positive checks, may be added, vici∣ous customs with respect to women, great cities, unwholesome manufactures, luxury, pestilence, and war.</P>
<P>All these checks may be fairly resolved into misery and vice.</P>
<P>And that these are the true causes of the slow increase of population in all the states of modern Europe, will appear suf∣ficiently evident, from the comparatively rapid increase that has invariably taken place, whenever these causes have been in any considerable degree removed.</P>

<P>New colonies.—Reasons of their rapid increase.—North American Colonies.—Extraordinary instance of increase in the back settlements.—Rapidity with which even old states recover the ravages of war, pestilence, famine, or the convulsions of nature.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been universally remarked, that all new colonies settled in healthy coun∣tries, where there was plenty of room and food, have constantly increased with astonishing rapidity in their population. Some of the colonies from ancient Greece, in no very long period, more than equalled their parent states in numbers and strength. And not to dwell on re∣mote instances, the European settle∣ments in the new world bear ample testimony to the truth of a remark, which, indeed, has never, that I know of, been doubted. A plenty of rich land,
<PB N="102" REF="118"/>
to be had for little or nothing, is so powerful a cause of population, as to overcome all other obstacles. No settle∣ments could well have been worse ma∣naged than those of Spain in Mexico, Peru, and Quito. The tyranny, supersti∣tion, and vices, of the mother-country, were introduced in ample quantities among her children. Exorbitant taxes were exacted by the Crown. The most ar∣bitrary restrictions were imposed on their trade. And the governors were not be∣hind hand in rapacity and extortion for themselves as well as their master. Yet, under all these difficulties, the colonies made a quick progress in population. The city of Lima, founded since the conquest, is represented by Ulloa as containing fifty thousand inhabitants near fifty years ago. Quito, which had been but a hamlet of Indians, is re∣presented by the same author as in his
<PB N="103" REF="119"/>
time equally populous. Mexico is said to contain a hundred thousand inha∣bitants, which, notwithstanding the ex∣aggerations of the Spanish writers, is supposed to be five times greater than what it contained in the time of Mon∣tezuma.</P>
<P>In the Portuguese colony of Brasil, governed with almost equal tyranny, there were supposed to be, thirty years since, six hundred thousand inhabitants of European extraction.</P>
<P>The Dutch and French colonies, though under the government of exclusive com∣panies of merchants, which, as Dr. Adam Smith says very justly, is the worst of all possible governments, still persisted in thriving under every disad∣vantage.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="120"/>
But the English North American co∣lonies, now, the powerful People of the United States of America, made by far the most rapid progress. To the plenty of good land which they possessed in com∣mon with the Spanish and Portuguese settlements, they added a greater de∣gree of liberty and equality. Though not without some restrictions on their foreign commerce, they were allowed a perfect liberty of managing their own internal affairs. The political insti∣tutions that prevailed were favoura∣ble to the alienation and division of property. Lands that were not cul∣tivated by the proprietor within a li∣mited time, were declared grantable to any other person. In Pensylvania there was no right of primogeniture; and in the provinces of New England, the eldest had only a double share. There were no tythes in any of the States, and
<PB N="105" REF="121"/>
scarcely any taxes. And on account of the extreme cheapness of good land, a capital could not be more advan∣tageously employed than in agricul∣ture, which at the same time that it supplies the greatest quantity of healthy work, affords much the most valuable produce to the society.</P>
<P>The consequence of these favourable circumstances united, was a rapidity of increase, probably without parallel in his∣tory. Throughout all the northern colo∣nies, the population was found to dou∣ble itself in 25 years. The original num∣ber of persons who had settled in the four provinces of new England in 1643, was 21,200 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I take these facts from Dr. Prince's two volumes of Observations, not having Dr. Styles's pamphlet, from which he quotes, by me.</NOTE>. Afterwards, it is supposed,
<PB N="106" REF="122"/>
that more left them, than went to them. In the year 1760, they were increased to half a million. They had therefore all along doubled their own number in 25 years. In new Jersey the period of doubling appeared to be 22 years; and in Rhode Island still less. In the back settlements, where the inhabitants ap∣plied themselves solely to agriculture, and luxury was not known, they were found to double their own number in 15 years, a most extraordinary instance of increase <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In instances of this kind, the powers of the earth appear to be fully equal to answer all the de∣mands for food that can be made upon it by man. But we should be led into an error, if we were thence to suppose that population and food ever really increase in the same ratio. The one is still a geometrical and the other an arithmetical ratio, that is, one increases by multiplication, and the other by addition. Where there are few people, and a great quantity of fertile land, the power of the earth to afford a yearly increase of food may be compared to a great reservoir of water, supplied by a moderate stream. The faster population increases, the more help will be got to draw off the water, and consequently an increasing quantity will be taken every year. But the sooner, undoubtedly, will the reservoir be exhausted, and the streams only remain. When acre has been added to acre, till all the fertile land is occupied, the yearly increase of food will depend upon the amelioration of the land al∣ready in possession; and even this moderate stream will be gradually diminishing. But population, could it be supplied with food, would go on with unex∣hausted vigour, and the increase of one period would furnish the power of a greater increase the next, and this without any limit.</NOTE>.

would naturally be first inhabited, the period of doubling was about 35 years; and in some of the maritime towns, the population was absolutely at a stand.</P>
<P>These facts seem to shew that popula∣tion increases exactly in the proportion, that the two great checks to it, misery
<PB N="108" REF="124"/>
and vice, are removed; and that there is not a truer criterion of the happiness and innocence of a people, than the ra∣pidity of their increase. The unwhole∣someness of towns, to which some per∣sons are necessarily driven, from the na∣ture of their trades, must be considered as a species of misery; and every the slightest check to marriage, from a pros∣pect of the difficulty of maintaining a family, may be fairly classed under the same head. In short, it is difficult to conceive any check to population, which does not come under the description of some species of misery or vice.</P>
<P>The population of the thirteen Ameri∣can States before the war, was reckoned at about three millions. Nobody imagines, that Great Britain is less populous at pre∣sent for the emigration of the small pa∣rent stock that produced these numbers.
<PB N="109" REF="125"/>
On the contrary, a certain degree of emi∣gration, is known to be favourable to the population of the mother country. It has been particularly remarked, that the two Spanish provinces from which the greatest number of people emigrated to America, became in consequence more populous. Whatever was the original number of British Emigrants that in∣creased so fast in the North American Colonies; let us ask, why does not an equal number produce an equal increase, in the same time, in Great Britain? The great and obvious cause to be assigned, is, the want of room and food, or, in other words, misery; and that this is a much more powerful cause even than vice, appears sufficiently evident from the rapidity with which even old States recover the desolations of war, pestilence, or the accidents of nature. They are then for a short time placed a little in
<PB N="110" REF="126"/>
the situation of new states; and the ef∣fect is always answerable to what might be expected. If the industry of the in∣habitants be not destroyed by sear or ty∣ranny, subsistence will soon increase be∣yond the wants of the reduced numbers; and the invariable consequence will be, that population which before, perhaps, was nearly stationary, will begin imme∣diately to increase.</P>
<P>The fertile province of Flanders, which has been so often the seat of the most destructive wars, after a respite of a few years, has appeared always as fruitful and as populous as ever. Even the Pa∣latinate lifted up its head again after the execrable ravages of Lewis the Four∣teenth. The effects of the dreadful plague in London in 1666, were not percep∣tible 15 or 20 years afterwards. The traces of the most destructive famines in
<PB N="111" REF="127"/>
China and Indostan, are by all accounts very soon obliterated. It may even be doubted whether Turkey and Egypt are upon an average much less populous, for the plagues that periodically lay them waste. If the number of people which they contain be less now than formerly, it is, probably, rather to be attributed to the tyranny and oppression of the govern∣ment under which they groan, and the consequent discouragements to agricul∣ture, than to the loss which they sus∣tain by the plague. The most tremen∣dous convulsions of nature, such as vol∣canic eruptions and earthquakes, if they do not happen so frequently as to drive away the inhabitants, or to destroy their spirit of industry, have but a trifling effect on the average population of any state. Naples, and the country under Vesuvius, are still very populous, not∣withstanding the repeated eruptions of that
<PB N="112" REF="128"/>
mountain. And Lisbon and Lima are now, probably, nearly in the same state with re∣gard to population, as they were before the last earthquakes.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A probable cause of epidemics.—Extracts from Mr. Sus∣milch's tables.—Periodical returns of sickly seasons to be expected in certain cases.—Proportion of births to burials for short periods in any country an inade∣quate criterion of the real average increase of popula∣tion.—Best criterion of a permanent increase of popu∣lation.—Great frugality of living one of the causes of the famines of China and Indostan.—Evil tendency of one of the clauses in Mr. Pitt's Poor Bill.—Only one proper way of encouraging popnlaiion.—Causes of the happiness of nations.—Famine, the last and most dread∣ful mode by which nature represses a redundant popula∣tion.—The three propositions considered as established.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY great attention to cleanliness, the plague seems at length to be completely expelled from London. But it is not im∣probable, that among the secondary causes that produce even sickly seasons and epidemics, ought to be ranked, a crowded population and unwholesome and insufficient food. I have been led
<PB N="114" REF="130"/>
to this remark, by looking over some of the tables of Mr. Susmilch, which Dr. Price has extracted in one of his notes to the postscript on the controversy re∣specting the population of England and Wales. They are considered as very correct; and if such tables were general, they would throw great light on the different ways by which population is repressed, and prevented from increasing beyond the means of subsistence in any country. I will extract a part of the tables, with Dr. Price's remarks.</P>

<P><Q>In this instance the inhabitants ap∣pear to have been almost doubled in 56 years, no very bad epidemics having once interrupted the increase, but the three years immediately following the last period (to 1759,) were years so sickly that the births were sunk to 10, 229, and the burials raised to 15, 068.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="132"/>
Is it not probable, that in this case, the number of inhabitants had increased faster than the food and the accommoda∣tions necessary to preserve them in health. The mass of the people would, upon this supposition, be obliged to live harder, and a greater number would be crouded together in one house; and it is not surely improbable, that these were among the na∣tural causes that produced the three sickly years. These causes may produce such an effect, though the country, absolutely considered, may not be extremely crowded and populous. In a country even thinly inhabited, if an increase of population take place, before more food is raised, and more houses are built, the inhabi∣tants must be distressed in some degree for room and subsistence. Were the marriages in England, for the next eight or ten years, to be more prolifick than usual, or even were a greater number of
<PB N="117" REF="133"/>
marriages than usual to take place, sup∣posing the number of houses to remain the same; instead of five or six to a cot∣tage, there must be seven or eight; and this, added to the necessity of harder living, would probably have a very un∣favourable effect on the health of the common people.</P>

<Q>The years 1738, 1740, 1750, and 1751, were particularly sickly.</Q></P>
<P>For further information on this sub∣ject, I refer the reader to Mr. Susmilch's tables. The extracts that I have made are sufficient to shew the periodical, though irregular returns of sickly sea∣sons; and it seems highly probable, that a scantiness of room and food was one of the principal causes that occasioned them.</P>
<P>It appears from the tables, that these countries were increasing rather fast for old states, notwithstanding the occasional sickly seasons that prevailed. Cultiva∣tion must have been improving, and marriages, consequently, encouraged. For the checks to population appear to have been rather of the positive, than of the preventive kind. When from a prospect
<PB N="119" REF="135"/>
of increasing plenty in any country, the weight that represses population is in some degree removed; it is highly probable that the motion will be con∣tinued beyond the operation of the cause that first impelled it. Or, to be more particular, when the increasing produce of a country, and the increasing demand for labour, so far ameliorate the condi∣tion of the labourer, as greatly to en∣courage marriage, it is probable that the custom of early marriages will con∣tinue, till the population of the coun∣try has gone beyond the increased pro∣duce: and sickly seasons appear to be the natural and necessary consequence. I should expect, therefore, that those countries where subsistence was increas∣ing sufficiently at times to encourage population, but not to answer all its d mands, would be more subject to pe∣riodical epidemics than those where the
<PB N="120" REF="136"/>
population could more completely ac∣commodate itself to the average pro∣duce.</P>
<P>An observation the converse of this will probably also be found true. In those countries that are subject to pe∣riodical sicknesses, the increase of popu∣lation, or the excess of births above the burials, will be greater in the intervals of these periods, than is usual, caeteris paribus, in the countries not so much subject to such disorders. If Turkey and Egypt have been nearly stationary in their average population for the last century, in the intervals of their perio∣dical plagues, the births must have ex∣ceeded the burials in a greater propor∣tion than in such countries as France and England.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="137"/>
The average proportion of births to burials in any country for a period of five or ten years, will hence appear to be a very inadequate criterion by which to judge of its real progress in popu∣lation. This proportion certainly shews the rate of increase during those five or ten years; but we can by no means thence infer, what had been the in∣crease for the twenty years before, or what would be the increase for the twenty years after. Dr. Price observes, that Sweden, Norway, Russia, and the kingdom of Naples, are increasing fast; but the extracts from registers that he has given, are not for periods of sufficient extent to establish the fact. It is highly probable, however, that Sweden, Norway, and Russia, are really increasing in their population, though not at the rate that the proportion of births to burials for the short periods that Dr. Price takes
<PB N="122" REF="138"/>
would seem to shew <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Price's Observations, 2 Vol. Postscript to the controversy on the population of England and Wales.</NOTE>. For five years, ending in 1777, the proportion of births to burials in the kingdom of Naples, was 144 to 100; but there is reason to suppose, that this proportion would in∣dicate an increase much greater than would be really found to have taken place in that kingdom during a period of a hundred years.</P>
<P>Dr. Short compared the registers of many villages and market towns in Eng∣land for two periods; the first, from Queen Elizabeth to the middle of the last century, and the second, from dif∣ferent years at the end of the last cen∣tury, to the middle of the present. And from a comparison of these ex∣tracts, it appears, that in the former pe∣riod
<PB N="123" REF="139"/>
the births exceeded the burials in the proportion of 124 to 100; but in the latter, only in the proportion of 111 to 100. Dr. Price thinks that the registers in the former period are not to be depended upon; but, probably, in this instance, they do not give incor∣rect proportions. At least, there are many reasons for expecting to find a greater excess of births above the burials in the former period than in the latter. In the natural progress of the popula∣tion of any country, more good land will, caeteris paribus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say caeteris paribus, because the increase of the produce of any country will always very greatly de∣pend on the spirit of industry that prevails, and the way in which it is directed. The knowledge and habits of the people, and other temporary causes, par∣ticularly the degree of civil liberty and equality ex∣isting at the time, must always have great influence in exciting and directing this spirit.</NOTE>, be taken into cul∣tivation in the earlier stages of it than
<PB N="124" REF="140"/>
in the later. And a greater propor∣tional yearly increase of produce, will almost invariably be followed by a greater proportional increase of population. But, besides this great cause, which would naturally give the excess of births above the burials greater at the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, than in the middle of the present century, I cannot help thinking that the occasional ravages of the plague in the former period, must have had some tendency to increase this proportion. If an average of ten years had been taken in the intervals of the returns of this dreadful disorder; or if the years of plague had been re∣jected as accidental, the registers would certainly give the proportion of births to burials too high for the real average increase of the population. For some few years after the great plague in 1666, it is probable that there was a
<PB N="125" REF="141"/>
more than usual excess of births above burials, particularly if Dr. Price's opi∣nion be founded, that England was more populous at the revolution (which hap∣pened only 22 years afterwards) than it is at present.</P>
<P>Mr. King, in 1693, stated the pro∣portion of the births to the burials throughout the Kingdom, exclusive of London, as 115 to 100. Dr. Short makes it, in the middle of the present century, 111 to 100, including Lon∣don. The proportion in France for five years, ending in 1774, was 117 to 100. If these statements are near the truth; and if there are no very great va∣riations at particular periods in the pro∣portions, it would appear, that the po∣pulation of France and England has ac∣commodated itself very nearly to the average produce of each country. The
<PB N="126" REF="142"/>
discouragements to marriage, the conse∣quent vicious habits, war, luxury, the silent though certain depopulation of large towns, and the close habitations, and insufficient food of many of the poor, prevent population from increasing beyond the means of subsistence; and, if I may use an expression which cer∣tainly at first appears strange, supercede the necessity of great and ravaging epi∣demics to repress what is redundant. Were a wasting plague to sweep off two millions in England, and six mil∣lions in France, there can be no doubt whatever, that after the inhabitants had recovered from the dreadful shock, the proportion of births to burials would be much above what it is in either country at present.</P>
<P>In New Jersey, the proportion of births to deaths on an average of seven
<PB N="127" REF="143"/>
years, ending in 1743, was as 300 to 100. In France and England, taking the highest proportion, it is as 117 to 100. Great and astonishing as this dif∣ference is, we ought not to be so wonder∣struck at it, as to attribute it to the miraculous interposition of heaven. The causes of it are not remote, latent and mysterious; but near us, round about us, and open to the investigation of every inquiring mind. It accords with the most liberal spirit of philosophy, to suppose that not a stone can fall, or a plant rise, without the immediate agency of divine power. But we know from experience, that these operations of what we call nature have been conducted al∣most invariably according to fixed laws. And since the world began, the causes of population and depopulation have pro∣bably been as constant as any of the
<PB N="128" REF="144"/>
laws of nature with which we are ac∣quainted.</P>
<P>The passion between the sexes has appeared in every age to be so nearly the same, that it may always be con∣sidered, in algebraic language, as a given quantity. The great law of necessity which prevents population from increas∣ing in any country beyond the food which it can either produce or acquire, is a law, so open to our view, so ob∣vious and evident to our understandings, and so completely confirmed by the ex∣perience of every age, that we cannot for a moment doubt it. The different modes which nature takes to prevent, or repress a redundant population, do not appear, indeed, to us so certain and regular; but, though we cannot always predict the mode, we may with cer∣tainty predict the fact. If the propor∣tion
<PB N="129" REF="145"/>
of births to deaths for a few years, indicate an increase of numbers much beyond the proportional increased or acquired produce of the country, we may be perfectly certain, that unless an emi∣gration takes place, the deaths will shortly exceed the births; and that the increase that had taken place for a few years cannot be the real average increase of the population of the country. Were there no other depopulating causes, every country would, without doubt, be subject to periodical pestilences or fa∣mines.</P>
<P>The only true criterion of a real and permanent increase in the popu∣lation of any country, is the increase of the means of subsistence. But even this criterion is subject to some slight variations, which are, however, com∣pletely open to our view and observa∣tions.
<PB N="130" REF="146"/>
In some countries population appears to have been forced; that is, the people have been habituated by de∣grees to live almost upon the smallest possible quantity of food. There must have been periods in such countries when population increased permanently, without an increase in the means of subsistence. China seems to answer to this description. If the accounts we have of it are to be trusted, the lower classes of people are in the habit of living almost upon the smallest possible quantity of food, and are glad to get any putrid offals that European la∣bourers would rather starve than eat. The law in China which permits pa∣rents to expose their children, has tended principally thus to force the population. A nation in this state must necessarily be subject to famines. Where a country is so populous in proportion to the
<PB N="131" REF="147"/>
means of subsistence, that the average produce of it is but barely sufficient to support the lives of the inhabitants, any deficiency from the badness of sea∣sons must be fatal. It is probable that the very frugal manner in which the Gentoos are in the habit of living, con∣tributes in some degree to the famines of Indostan.</P>
<P>In America, where the reward of la∣bour is at present so liberal, the lower classes might retrench very considerably in a year of scarcity, without materially distressing themselves. A famine there∣fore seems to be almost impossible. It may be expected, that in the progress of the population of America, the la∣bourers will in time be much less liber∣ally rewarded. The numbers will in this case permanently increase, without a
<PB N="132" REF="148"/>
proportional increase in the means of subsistence.</P>
<P>In the different States of Europe there must be some variations in the propor∣tion between the number of inhabitants, and the quantity of food consumed, aris∣ing from the different habits of living that prevail in each State. The labourers of the South of England are so accus∣tomed to eat fine wheaten bread, that they will suffer themselves to be half starved, before they will submit to live like the Scotch peasants. They might perhaps in time, by the constant opera∣tion of the hard law of necessity, be reduced to live even like the lower Chinese: and the country would then, with the same quantity of food, support a greater population. But to effect this must always be a most difficult, and
<PB N="133" REF="149"/>
every friend to humanity will hope, an abortive attempt. Nothing is so com∣mon as to hear of encouragements that ought to be given to population. If the tendency of mankind to increase be so great as I have represented it to be, it may appear strange that this increase does not come when it is thus repeatedly called for. The true reason is, that the demand for a greater population is made without preparing the funds necessary to support it. Increase the demand for agricultural labour by promoting culti∣vation, and with it consequently in∣crease the produce of the country, and ameliorate the condition of the labourer, and no apprehensions whatever need be entertained of the proportional increase of population. An attempt to effect this purpose in any other way is vicious, cruel, and tyrannical, and in any state of tolerable freedom cannot therefore suc∣ceed.
<PB N="134" REF="150"/>
It may appear to be the interest of the rulers, and the rich of a State, to force population, and thereby lower the price of labour, and consequently the expence of fleets and armies, and the cost of manufactures for foreign sale: but every attempt of the kind should be carefully watched and strenuously resisted by the friends of the poor, particularly when it comes under the deceitful garb of benevolence, and is likely, on that account, to be cheerfully, and cordially received by the common people.</P>
<P>I entirely acquit Mr. Pitt of any sinister intention in that clause of his poor bill which allows a shilling a week to every labourer for each child he has above three. I confess, that before the bill was brought into Parliament, and for some time after, I thought that such a regulation would be highly beneficial;
<PB N="135" REF="151"/>
but further reflection on the subject has convinced me, that if its object be to better the condition of the poor, it is calculated to defeat the very purpose which it has in view. It has no ten∣dency that I can discover to increase the produce of the country; and if it tend to increase population, without in∣creasing the produce, the necessary and inevitable consequence appears to be, that the same produce must be divided among a greater number, and conse∣quently that a day's labour will pur∣chase a smaller quantity of provisions, and the poor therefore in general must be more distressed.</P>
<P>I have mentioned some cases, where population may permanently increase, without a proportional increase in the means of subsistence. But it is evident that the variation in different States,
<PB N="136" REF="152"/>
between the food and the numbers sup∣ported by it, is restricted to a limit be∣yond which it cannot pass. In every country, the population of which is not absolutely decreasing, the food must be necessarily sufficient to support, and to continue, the race of labourers.</P>
<P>Other circumstances being the same, it may be affirmed, that countries are populous, according to the quantity of human food which they produce; and happy, according to the liberality with which that food is divided, or the quan∣tity which a day's labour will purchase. Corn countries are more populous than pasture countries; and rice countries more populous than corn countries. The lands in England are not suited to rice, but they would all bear potatoes: and Dr. Adam Smith observes, that if pota∣toes were to become the favourite vegeta∣ble
<PB N="137" REF="153"/>
food of the common people, and if the same quantity of land was employed in their culture, as is now employed in the culture of corn, the country would be able to support a much greater population; and would consequently in a very short time have it.</P>
<P>The happiness of a country does not depend, absolutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing, upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unresricted population. This approximation is al∣ways the nearest in new colonies, where the knowledge and industry of an old State, operate on the fertile unappro∣priated land of a new one. In other cases, the youth or the age of a State is not in
<PB N="138" REF="154"/>
this respect of very great importance. It is probable, that the food of Great Britain is divided in as great plenty to the inhabitants, at the present period, as it was two thousand, three thousand, or four thousand years ago. And there is reason to believe that the poor and thinly inhabited tracts of the Scotch Highlands, are as much distressed by an overcharged population, as the rich and populous pro∣vince of Flanders.</P>
<P>Were a country never to be over-run by a people more advanced in arts, but left to its own natural progress in civiliza∣tion; from the time that its produce might be considered as an unit, to the time that it might be considered as a million, during the lapse of many hun∣dred years, there would not be a single period, when the mass of the people
<PB N="139" REF="155"/>
could be said to be free from distress, either directly or indirectly, for want of food. In every State in Europe, since we have first had accounts of it, millions and millions of human existences have been repressed from this simple cause; though perhaps in some of these States, an absolute famine has never been known.</P>
<P>Famine seems to be the last, the most dreadful resource of nature. The power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruc∣tion; and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epi∣demics,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Wallace.—Error of supposing that the difficulty arising from poupulation is at a great distance.—Mr. Condorcet's sketch of the progress of the human mind.—Period when the oscillation, mentioned by Mr. Con∣dorcet, ought to be applied to the human race.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO a person who draws the preceding obvious inferences, from a view of the past and present state of mankind, it cannot but be a matter of astonishment, that all the writers on the perfectibility of man and of society, who have noticed the ar∣gument of an overcharged population, treat it always very slightly, and inva∣riably represent the difficulties arising from it, as at a great and almost immea∣surable distance. Even Mr. Wallace, who thought the argument itself of so much weight, as to destroy his whole system of equality, did not seem to be aware that any
<PB N="143" REF="159"/>
difficulty would occur from this cause, till the whole earth had been cultivated like a garden, and was incapable of any further increase of produce. Were this really the case, and were a beautiful system of equality in other respects prac∣ticable, I cannot think that our ardour in the pursuit of such a scheme ought to be damped by the contemplation of so re∣mote a difficulty. An event at such a distance might fairly be left to provi∣dence: but the truth is, that if the view of the argument given in this essay be just, the difficulty so far from being remote, would be imminent, and imme∣diate. At every period during the pro∣gress of cultivation, from the present moment, to the time when the whole earth was become like a garden, the distress for want of food would be con∣stantly pressing on all mankind, if they were equal. Though the produce of the
<PB N="144" REF="160"/>
earth might be increasing every year, po∣pulation would be increasing much faster; and the redundancy must necessarily be repressed by the periodical or constant ac∣tion of misery or vice.</P>
<P>Mr. Condorcet's Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain, was written, it is said, under the pres∣sure of that cruel proscription which ter∣minated in his death. If he had no hopes of its being seen during his life, and of its interesting France in his favour, it is a singular instance of the attachment of a man to principles, which every days ex∣perience was so fatally for himself contra∣dicting. To see the human mind in one of the most enlightened nations of the world, and after a lapse of some thou∣sand years, debased by such a fermenta∣tion of disgusting passions, of fear, cru∣elty, malice, revenge, ambition, mad∣ness,
<PB N="145" REF="161"/>
and folly, as would have disgraced the most savage nation in the most barba∣rous age, must have been such a tremen∣dous shock to his ideas, of the necessary and inevitable progress of the human mind, that nothing but the firmest con∣viction of the truth of his principles, in spite of all appearances, could have with∣stood.</P>
<P>This posthumous publication, is only a sketch of a much larger work, which he proposed should be executed. It neces∣sarily, therefore, wants that detail and application, which can alone prove the truth of any theory. A few observations will be sufficient to shew how com∣pletely the theory is contradicted, when it is applied to the real, and not to an imaginary state of things.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="162"/>
In the last division of the work, which treats of the future progress of man to∣wards perfection, he says, that comparing, in the different civilized nations of Eu∣rope, the actual population with the ex∣tent of territory; and observing their cul∣tivation, their industry, their divisions of labour, and their means of subsistence, we shall see that it would be impossible to preserve the same means of subsistence, and, consequently, the same population, without a number of individuals, who have no other means of supplying their wants, than their industry. Having al∣lowed the necessity of such a class of men, and adverting afterwards to the pre∣carious revenue of those families that would depend so entirely on the life and health of their chief <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To save time and long quotations, I shall here give the substance of some of Mr. Condorcet's sen∣timents, and hope I shall not misrepresent them, but I refer the reader to the work itself, which will amuse, if it does not convince him.</NOTE>, he says, very justly, 
<PB N="147" REF="163"/>
<Q>There exists then, a necessary cause of inequality, of dependence, and even of misery, which menaces, without ceasing, the most numerous and active class of our societies.</Q> The difficulty is just, and well stated, and I am afraid that the mode by which he proposes it should be removed, will be found inefficacious. By the application of calculations to the probabilities of life, and the interest of money, he proposes that a fund should be established, which should assure to the old an assistance, produced, in part, by their own former savings, and, in part, by the savings of individuals, who in making the same sacrifice, die before they reap the benefit of it. The same, or a similar fund, should give assistance to
<PB N="148" REF="164"/>
women and children, who lose their hus∣bands, or fathers; and afford a capital to those who were of an age to found a new family, sufficient for the proper de∣velopment of their industry. These esta∣blishments he observes, might be made, in the name, and under the protection, of the society. Going still further, he says, that by the just application of calculations, means might be found of more completely preserving a state of equality, by pre∣venting credit from being the exclusive privilege of great fortunes, and yet giv∣ing it a basis equally solid, and by ren∣dering the progress of industry, and the activity of commerce, less dependent on great capitalists.</P>
<P>Such establishments and calculations, may appear very promising upon paper, but when applied to real life, they will be found to be absolutely nugatory. Mr.
<PB N="149" REF="165"/>
Condorcet allows, that a class of people, which maintains itself entirely by in∣dustry, is necessary to every state. Why does he allows this? No other reason can well be assigned, than that he conceives that the labour necessary to procure sub∣sistence for an extended population, will not be performed without the goad of necessity. If by establishments of this kind, this spur to industry be removed, if the idle and the negligent are placed upon the same footing with regard to their credit, and the future support of their wives and families, as the active and industrious; can we expect to see men exert that animated activity in bettering their condition, which now forms the master spring of public pros∣perity. If an inquisition were to be established, to examine the claims of each individual, and to determine whether he had, or had not, exerted himself to the
<PB N="150" REF="166"/>
utmost, and to grant or refuse assist∣ance accordingly, this would be little else than a repetition upon a larger scale of the English poor laws, and would be completely destructive of the true princi∣ples of liberty and equality.</P>
<P>But independent of this great objec∣tion to these establishments, and suppo∣sing for a moment, that they would give no check to productive industry, by far the greatest difficulty remains yet behind.</P>
<P>Were every man sure of a comfortable provision for a family, almost every man would have one; and were the rising ge∣neration free from the <Q>killing frost</Q> of misery, population must rapidly increase. Of this, Mr. Condorcet seems to be fully aware himself; and after having described further improvements, he says,</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="167"/>
<Q>But in this progress of industry and happiness, each generation will be called to more extended enjoyments, and in consequence, by the physical constitu∣tion of the human frame, to an in∣crease in the number of individuals. Must not there arrive a period then, when these laws, equally necessary, shall coun∣teract each other? When the increase of the number of men surpassing their means of subsistence, the necessary re∣sult must be, either a continual dimi∣nution of happiness and population, a movement truly retrograde, or at least, a kind of oscillation between good and evil? In societies arrived at this term, will not this oscillation be a constantly subsist∣ing cause of periodical misery? Will it not mark the limit when all further ame∣lioration will become impossible, and point out that term to the perfectibility of the human race, which it may reach
<PB N="152" REF="168"/>
in the course of ages, but can never pass?</Q></P>
<P>He then adds,</P>
<P><Q>There is no person who does not see how very distant such a period is from us; but shall we ever arrive at it? It is equally impossible to pronounce for or against the future realization of an event, which cannot take place, but at an aera, when the human race will have attained improvements, of which we can at present scarcely form a conception.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Condorcet's picture of what may be expected to happen when the number of men shall surpass the means of their subsistence, is justly drawn. The oscilla∣tion which he describes, will certainly take place, and will, without doubt, be a constantly subsisting cause of perio∣dical misery. The only point in which I differ from Mr. Condorcet with regard
<PB N="153" REF="169"/>
to this picture, is, the period, when it may be applied to the human race. Mr. Condorcet thinks, that it cannot possi∣bly be applicable, but at an aera ex∣tremely distant. If the proportion be∣tween the natural increase of popula∣lation and food, which I have given, be in any degree near the truth, it will appear, on the contrary, that the period when the number of men surpass their means of subsistence, has long since arrived; and that this necessary oscillation, this constantly subsisting cause of periodical misery, has existed ever since we have had any histories of mankind, does exist at present, and will for ever continue to exist, unless some decided change take place, in the phy∣sical constitution of our nature.</P>
<P>Mr. Condorcet, however, goes on to say, that should the period, which he
<PB N="154" REF="170"/>
conceives to be so distant, ever arrive, the human race, and the advocates for the perfectibility of man, need not be alarmed at it. He then proceeds to re∣move the difficulty in a manner, which I profess not to understand. Having ob∣served, that the ridiculous prejudices of superstition, would by that time have ceased to throw over morals, a corrupt and degrading austerity, he alludes, ei∣ther to a promiscuous concubinage, which would prevent breeding, or to something else as unnatural. To remove the diffi∣culty in this way, will, surely, in the opinion of most men, be, to destroy that virtue, and purity of manners, which the advocates of equality, and of the per∣fectibility of man, profess to be the end and object of their views.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Condorcet's conjecture concerning the organic per∣fectibility of man, and the indefinite prolongation of human life.—Fallacy of the argument, which infers an unlimited progress from a partial improvement, the limit of which cannot be ascertained, illustrated in the breeding of animals, and the cultivation of plants.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE last question which Mr. Condorcet proposes for examination, is, the organic perfectibility of man. He observes, that if the proofs which have been already given, and which, in their development will receive greater force in the work it∣self, are sufficient to establish the indefi∣nite perfectibility of man, upon the sup∣position, of the same natural faculties, and the same organization which he has at present; what will be the certainty, what the extent of our hope, if this organization, these natural faculties
<PB N="156" REF="172"/>
themselves, are susceptible of ameliora∣tion?</P>
<P>From the improvement of medicine; from the use of more wholesome food, and habitations; from a manner of liv∣ing, which will improve the strength of the body by exercise, without impairing it by excess; from the destruction of the two great causes of the degradation of man, misery, and too great riches; from the gradual removal of transmissible and contagious disorders, by the improvement of physical knowledge, rendered more efficacious, by the progress of reason and of social order; he infers, that though man will not absolutely become immor∣tal, yet that the duration between his birth, and naural death, will increase without ceasing, will have no assignable term, and may properly be expressed by the word indefinite. He then defines
<PB N="157" REF="173"/>
this word to mean, either a constant ap∣proach to an unlimited extent, without ever reaching it; or, an increase in the im∣mensity of ages to an extent greater than any assignable quantity.</P>
<P>But surely the application of this term in either of these senses, to the duration of human life, is in the highest degree unphilosophical, and totally unwarranted by any appearances in the laws of na∣ture. Variations from different causes are essentially distinct from a regular and unre∣trograde increase. The average duration of human life will, to a certain degree, vary, from healthy or unhealthy climates, from wholesome or unwholesome food, from virtuous or vicious manners, and other causes; but it may be fairly doubted, whether there is really the smallest per∣ceptible advance in the natural duration of human life, since first we have had
<PB N="158" REF="174"/>
any authentic history of man. The pre∣judices of all ages have indeed been di∣rectly contrary to this supposition, and though I would not lay much stress upon these prejudices, they will in some mea∣sure tend to prove, that there has been no marked advance in an opposite di∣rection.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be said, that the world is yet so young, so completely in its in∣fancy, that it ought not to be expected that any difference should appear so soon.</P>
<P>If this be the case, there is at once an end of all human science. The whole train of reasonings from effects to causes will be destroyed. We may shut our eyes to the book of nature, as it will no longer be of any use to read it. The wildest and most improbable conjectures may be advanced with as much certainty
<PB N="159" REF="175"/>
as the most just and sublime theories, founded on careful and reiterated experi∣ments. We may return again to the old mode of philosophizing, and make facts bend to systems, instead of establishing systems upon facts. The grand and con∣sistent theory of Newton, will be placed upon the same footing as the wild and excentric hypotheses of Descartes. In short, if the laws of nature are thus fickle and inconstant; if it can be affirmed, and be believed, that they will change, when for ages and ages they have ap∣peared immutable, the human mind will no longer have any incitements to in∣quiry, but must remain fixed in inactive torpor, or amuse itself only in bewilder∣ing dreams, and extravagant fancies.</P>
<P>The constancy of the laws of nature, and of effects and causes, is the founda∣tion of all human knowledge; though
<PB N="160" REF="176"/>
far be it from me to say, that the same power which framed and executes the laws of nature, may not change them all <Q>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.</Q> Such a change may undoubtedly happen. All that I mean to say is, that it is impossible to infer it from rea∣soning. If without any previous observa∣ble symptoms or indications of a change, we can infer that a change will take place, we may as well make any asser∣tion whatever, and think it as unreason∣able to be contradicted, in affirming that the moon will come in contact with the earth to-morrow, as in saying, that the sun will rise at its usual time.</P>
<P>With regard to the duration of human life, there does not appear to have exist∣ed, from the earliest ages of the world, to the present moment, the smallest permanent symptom, or indication, of in∣creasing
<PB N="161" REF="177"/>
prolongation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Many, I doubt not, will think that the attempt∣ing gravely to controvert so absurd a paradox, as the immortality of man on earth, or indeed, even the per∣fectibility of man and society, is a waste of time and words; and that such unfounded conjectures are best answered by neglect. I profess, however, to be of a different opinion. When paradoxes of this kind are advanced by ingenious and able men, neglect has no tendency to convince them of their mistakes. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d∣ing themselves on what they conceive to be a mark of the reach and size of their own understandings, of the extent and comprehensiveness of their views; they will look upon this neglect merely as an indication of poverty, and narrowness, in the mental exertions of their contemporaries; and only think, that the world is not yet prepared to receive their sublime truths.</P>
<P>On the contrary, a candid investigation of these subjects, accompanied with a perfect readiness to adopt any theory, warranted by sound philosophy, may have a tendency to convince them, that in form∣ing improbable and unfounded hypotheses, so far from enlarging the bounds of human science, they are con∣tracting it; so far from promoting the improvement of the human mind, they are obstructing it: they are throwing us back again almost into the infancy of knowledge; and weakening the foundations of that mode of philosophising, under the auspices of which, science has of late made such rapid advances. The present rage for wide and unrestrained speculation, seems to be a kind of mental intoxication, arising, perhaps, from the great and unexpected discoveries which have been made of late years, in various branches of science. To men elate, and giddy with such suc∣cesses, every thing appeared to be within the grasp of human powers; and, under this illusion, they con∣founded subjects where no real progress could be proved, with those, where the progress had been marked, certain, and acknowledged. Could they be persuaded to sober themselves with a little severe and chastized thinking, they would see, that the cause of truth, and of sound philosophy, cannot but suffer by sub∣stituting wild flights and unsupported assertions, for patient investigation, and well authenticated proofs.</P></NOTE> The observable effects of climate, habit, diet, and other
<PB N="162" REF="178"/>
causes, on length of life, have furnished the pretext for asserting its indefinite ex∣tension; and the sandy foundation on
<PB N="163" REF="179"/>
which the argument rests, is, that be∣cause the limit of human life is unde∣fined; because you cannot mark its pre∣cise term, and say so far exactly shall it go and no further; that therefore its ex∣tent may increase for ever, and be properly termed, indefinite or unlimited. But the fallacy and absurdity of this argument will sufficiently appear from a slight exa∣mination of what Mr. Condorcet calls the organic perfectibility, or degeneration, of the race of plants and animals, which he says may be regarded as one of the general laws of nature.</P>
<P>I am told that it is a maxim among the improvers of cattle, that you may breed to any degree of nicety you please, and they found this maxim upon ano∣ther, which is, that some of the offspring will possess the desirable qualities of the parents in a greater degree. In the
<PB N="164" REF="180"/>
famous Leicestershire breed of sheep, the object is to procure them with small heads and small legs. Proceeding upon these breeding maxims, it is evident, that we might go on till the heads and legs were evanescent quantities; but this is so palpable an absurdity, that we may be quite sure that the premises are not just, and that there really is a limit, though we cannot see it, or say exactly where it is. In this case, the point of the greatest degree of improvement, or the smallest size of the head and legs, may be said to be undefined, but this is very different from unlimited, or from indefininite, in Mr. Condorcet's accepta∣tion of the term. Though I may not be able, in the present instance, to mark the limit, at which further improvement will stop, I can very easily mention a point at which it will not arrive. I should not scruple to assert, that were the breeding
<PB N="165" REF="181"/>
to continue for ever, the head and legs of these sheep would never be so small as the head and legs of a rat.</P>
<P>It cannot be true, therefore, that among animals, some of the offspring will possess the desirable qualities of the parents in a greater degree; or that animals are inde∣finitely perfectible.</P>
<P>The progress of a wild plant, to a beautiful garden flower, is perhaps more marked and striking, than any thing that takes place among animals, yet even here, it would be the height of absur∣dity to assert, that the progress was un∣limited or indefinite. One of the most obvious features of the improvement is the increase of size. The flower has grown gradually larger by cultivation. If the progress were really unlimited, it might be increased ad infinitum; but
<PB N="166" REF="182"/>
this is so gross an absurdity, that we may be quite sure, that among plants, as well as among animals, there is a limit to im∣provement, though we do not exactly know where it is. It is probable that the gardeners who contend for flower prizes have often applied stronger dress∣ing without success. At the same time, it would be highly presumptuous in any man to say, that he had seen the finest carnation or anemone that could ever be made to grow. He might however assert without the smallest chance of being contradicted by a future fact, that no carnation or anemone could ever by cultivation be increased to the size of a large cabbage; and yet there are assign∣able quantities much greater than a cab∣bage. No man can say that he has seen the largest ear of wheat, or the largest oak that could ever grow; but he might easily, and with perfect certainty, name a
<PB N="167" REF="183"/>
point of magnitude, at which they would not arrive. In all these cases therefore, a careful distinction should be made, between an unlimited progress, and a progress where the limit is merely unde∣fined.</P>
<P>It will be said, perhaps, that the rea∣son why plants and animals cannot in∣crease indefinitely in size, is, that they would fall by their own weight. I an∣swer, how do we know this but from experience? from experience of the de∣gree of strength with which these bodies are formed. I know that a carnation, long before it reached the size of a cab∣bage, would not be supported by its stalk; but I only know this from my experience of the weakness, and want of tenacity in the materials of a carnation stalk. There are many substances in na∣ture
<PB N="168" REF="184"/>
of the same size that would support as large a head as a cabbage.</P>
<P>The reasons of the mortality of plants are at present perfectly unknown to us. No man can say why such a plant is an∣nual, another biennial, and another en∣dures for ages. The whole affair in all these cases, in plants, animals, and in the human race, is an affair of experi∣ence; and I only conclude that man is mortal, because the invariable experi∣ence of all ages has proved the mortality of those materials of which his visible body is made.</P>
<Q>What can we reason but from what we know.</Q>
<P>Sound philosophy will not autho∣rize me to alter this opinion of the mortality of man on earth, till it can be clearly proved, that the human race has
<PB N="169" REF="185"/>
made, and is making, a decided progress towards an illimitable extent of life. And the chief reason why I adduced the two particular instances from animals and plants, was to expose, and illustrate, if I could, the fallacy of that argument, which infers an unlimited progress, merely because some partial improve∣ment has taken place, and that the limit of this improvement cannot be precisely ascertained.</P>
<P>The capacity of improvement in plants and animals, to a certain degree, no per∣son can possibly doubt. A clear and de∣cided progress has already been made; and yet, I think it appears, that it would be highly absurd to say, that this pro∣gress has no limits. In human life, though there are great variations from different causes, it may be doubted, whether, since the world began, any
<PB N="170" REF="186"/>
organic improvement whatever in the human frame can be clearly ascertained. The foundations therefore, on which the arguments for the organic perfectibility of man rest, are unusually weak, and can only be considered as mere conjec∣tures. It does not, however, by any means, seem impossible, that by an at∣tention to breed, a certain degree of im∣provement, similar to that among ani∣mals, might take place among men. Whether intellect could be communicated may be a matter of doubt: but size, strength, beauty, complexion, and per∣haps even longevity are in a degree trans∣missible. The error does not seem to lie, in supposing a small degree of improve∣ment possible, but in not discriminating between a small improvement, the limit of which is undefined, and an improve∣ment really unlimited. As the human race however could not be improved in
<PB N="171" REF="187"/>
this way, without condemning all the bad specimens to celibacy, it is not probable, that an attention to breed should ever become general; indeed, I know of no well-directed attempts of the kind, ex∣cept in the ancient family of the Bicker∣staffs, who are said to have been very successful in whitening the skins, and increasing the height of their race by prudent marriages, particularly by that very judicious cross with Maud, the milk-maid, by which some capital de∣fects in the constitutions of the family were corrected.</P>
<P>It will not be necessary, I think, in order more completely to shew the im∣probability of any approach in man towards immortality on earth, to urge the very great additional weight that an increase in the duration of life would give to the argument of population.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="188"/>
Mr. Condorcet's book may be consider∣ed, not only as a sketch of the opinions of a celebrated individual, but of many of the literary men in France, at the begin∣ning of the revolution. As such, though merely a sketch, it seems worthy of at∣tention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Godwin's system of equality.—Error of attributing all the vices of mankind to human institutions.—Mr. Godwin's first answer to the difficulty arising from po∣pulation totally insufficient.—Mr. Godwin's beautiful system of equality supposed to be realized.—It's utter destruction simply from the principle of population in so short a time as thirty years.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN reading Mr. Godwin's ingenious and able work on political justice, it is im∣possible not to be struck with the spi∣rit and energy of his style, the force and precision of some of his reasonings, the ardent tone of his thoughts, and par∣ticularly with that impressive earnest∣ness of manner which gives an air of truth to the whole. At the same time, it must be confessed, that he has not proceeded in his enquiries with the caution that sound philosophy seems to require. His conclusions are often un∣warranted
<PB N="174" REF="190"/>
by his premises. He fails sometimes in removing the objections which he himself brings forward. He relies too much on general and abstract propositions which will not admit of ap∣plication. And his conjectures certainly far outstrip the modesty of nature.</P>
<P>The system of equality which Mr. Godwin proposes, is, without doubt, by far the most beautiful and engaging of any that has yet appeared. An amelio∣ration of society to be produced merely by reason and conviction, wears much more the promise of permanence, than any change effected and maintained by force. The unlimited exercise of private judgment, is a doctrine inexpressibly grand and captivating, and has a vast superiority over those systems where every individual is in a manner the slave of the public. The substitution of bene∣volence
<PB N="175" REF="191"/>
as the master-spring, and mov∣ing principle of society, instead of self∣love, is a consummation devoutly to be wished. In short, it is impossible to contemplate the whole of this fair structure, without emotions of delight and admiration, accompanied with ardent longing for the period of its accomplish∣ment. But, alas! that moment can never arrive. The whole is little better than a dream, a beautiful phantom of the imagination. These <Q>gorgeous pa∣laces</Q> of happiness and immortality, these <Q>solemn temples</Q> of truth and vir∣tue will dissolve, <Q>like the baseless fa∣bric of a vision,</Q> when we awaken to real life, and contemplate the true and genuine situation of man on earth.</P>
<P>Mr. Godwin, at the conclusion of the third chapter of his eighth book, speak∣ing of population, says, <Q>There is a
<PB N="176" REF="192"/>
principle in human society, by which population is perpetually kept down to the level of the means of subsistence. Thus among the wandering tribes of America and Asia, we never find through the lapse of ages that population has so increased as to render necessary the cultivation of the earth</Q> This principle, which Mr. Godwin thus mentions as some mysterious and occult cause, and which he does not attempt to investigate, will be found to be the grinding law of necessity; misery, and the fear of misery.</P>
<P>The great error under which Mr. Godwin labours throughout his whole work, is, the attributing almost all the vices and misery that are seen in civil society to human institutions. Political regulations, and the established admi∣nistration of property, are with him
<PB N="177" REF="193"/>
the fruitful sources of all evil, the hot∣beds of all the crimes that degrade man∣kind. Were this really a true state of the case, it would not seem a hopeless task to remove evil completely from the world; and reason seems to be the proper and adequate instrument for ef∣fecting so great a purpose. But the truth is, that though human institutions appear to be the obvious and obtrusive causes of much mischief to mankind; yet, in reality, they are light and su∣perficial, they are mere feathers that float on the surface, in comparison with those deeper seated causes of impurity that corrupt the springs, and render turbid the whole stream of human life.</P>
<P>Mr. Godwin, in his chapter on the benefits attendant on a system of equa∣lity, says, <Q>The spirit of oppression, the spirit of servility, and the spirit of
<PB N="178" REF="194"/>
fraud, these are the immediate growth of the established administration of pro∣perty. They are alike hostile to in∣tellectual improvement. The other vices of envy, malice, and revenge, are their inseparable companions. In a state of society, where men lived in the midst of plenty, and where all shared alike the bounties of nature, these sentiments would inevitably expire. The narrow principle of selfishness would vanish. No man being obliged to guard his little store, or provide with anxiety and pain for his restless wants, each would lose his individual existence in the thought of the general good. No man would be an enemy to his neighbour, for they would have no subject of contention; and, of consequence, philanthropy would resume the empire which reason assigns her. Mind would be delivered from her perpetual anxiety about corporal
<PB N="179" REF="195"/>
support, and free to expatiate in the field of thought, which is congenial to her. Each would assist the enquiries of all.</Q></P>
<P>This would, indeed, be a happy state. But that it is merely an imaginary picture, with scarcely a feature near the truth, the reader, I am afraid, is al∣ready too well convinced.</P>
<P>Man cannot live in the midst of plenty. All cannot share alike the bounties of nature. Were there no esta∣blished administration of property, every man would be obliged to guard with force his little store. Selfishness would be triumphant. The subjects of conten∣tion would be perpetual. Every indivi∣dual mind would be under a constant anxiety about corporal support; and not

a single intellect would be left free to expatiate in the field of thought.</P>
<P>How little Mr. Godwin has turned the attention of his penetrating mind to the real state of man on earth, will sufficiently appear from the manner in which he endeavours to remove the difficulty of an overcharged population. He says, <Q>The obvious answer to this objection, is, that to reason thus is to foresee difficulties at a great distance. Three fourths of the habitable globe is now uncultivated. The parts already cultivated are capable of immeasureable improvement. Myriads of centuries of still increasing population may pass away, and the earth be still found sufficient for the subsistence of its inhabitants.</Q></P>
<P>I have already pointed out the error of supposing that no distress and diffi∣culty
<PB N="181" REF="197"/>
would arise from an overcharged population before the earth absolutely refused to produce any more. But let us imagine for a moment Mr. God∣win's beautiful system of equality realized in its utmost purity, and see how soon this difficulty might be expected to press under so perfect a form of society. A theory that will not admit of ap∣plication cannot possibly be just.</P>
<P>Let us suppose all the causes of mi∣sery and vice in this island removed. War and contention cease. Unwhole∣some trades and manufactories do not exist. Crowds no longer collect toge∣ther in great and pestilent cities for purposes of court intrigue, of commerce, and vicious gratifications. Simple, healthy, and rational amusements take place of drinking, gaming and debauchery. There are no towns sufficiently large to have
<PB N="182" REF="198"/>
any prejudicial effects on the human constitution. The greater part of the happy inhabitants of this terrestrial pa∣radise live in hamlets and farm-houses scattered over the face of the country. Every house is clean, airy, sufficiently roomy, and in a healthy situation. All men are equal. The labours of luxury are at end. And the necessary labours of agriculture are shared amica∣bly among all. The number of persons, and the produce of the island, we sup∣pose to be the same as at present. The spirit of benevolence, guided by impar∣tial justice, will divide this produce among all the members of the society according to their wants. Though it would be impossible that they should all have animal food every day, yet vegetable food, with meat occasionally, would satisfy the desires of a frugal people, and would be sufficient to pre∣serve
<PB N="183" REF="199"/>
them in health, strength, and spirits.</P>
<P>Mr. Godwin considers marriage as a fraud and a monopoly. Let us suppose the commerce of the sexes established upon principles of the most perfect freedom. Mr. Godwin does not think himself that this freedom would lead to a promiscuous intercourse; and in this I perfectly agree with him. The love of variety is a vi∣cious, corrupt, and unnatural taste, and could not prevail in any great degree in a simple and virtuous state of society. Each man would probably select himself a partner, to whom he would adhere as long as that adherence continued to be the choice of both parties. It would be of little consequence, according to Mr. Godwin, how many children a woman had, or to whom they belonged. Provi∣sions and assistance would spontaneously
<PB N="184" REF="200"/>
flow from the quarter in which they abounded, to the quarter that was de∣ficient <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See B. S. Chap. 8. P. 504.</NOTE>. And every man would be ready to furnish instruction to the rising genera∣tion according to his capacity.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive a form of society so favourable upon the whole to popu∣lation. The irremediableness of marri∣age, as it is at present constituted, un∣doubtedly deters many from entering into that state. An unshackled inter∣course on the contrary, would be a most powerful incitement to early attachments: and as we are supposing no anxiety about the future support of children to exist, I do not conceive that there would be one woman in a hundred, of twenty three, without a family.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="201"/>
With these extraordinary encourage∣ments to population, and every cause of depopulation, as we have supposed, re∣moved, the numbers would necessarily increase faster than in any society that has ever yet been known. I have men∣tioned, on the authority of a pamphlet published by a Dr. Styles, and referred to by Dr. Price, that the inhabitants of the back settlements of America doubled their numbers in fifteen years. England is certainly a more healthy country than the back settlements of America; and as we have supposed every house in the island to be airy and wholesome, and the encou∣ragements to have a family greater even than with the back settlers, no probable reason can be assigned, why the population should not double itself in less, if possi∣ble, than fifteen years. But to be quite sure that we do not go beyond the truth, we will only suppose the period of doub∣ling
<PB N="186" REF="202"/>
to be twenty-five years, a ratio of in∣crease, which is well known to have taken place throughout all the Northern States of America.</P>
<P>There can be little doubt, that the equalization of property which we have supposed, added to the circumstance of the labour of the whole community be∣ing directed chiefly to agriculture, would tend greatly to augment the produce of the country. But to answer the demands of a population increasing so rapidly, Mr. Godwin's calculation of half an hour a day for each man, would cer∣tainly not be sufficient. It is probable that the half of every man's time must be employed for this purpose. Yet with such, or much greater exertions, a per∣son who is acquainted with the nature of the soil in this country, and who reflects on the fertility of the lands already in
<PB N="187" REF="203"/>
cultivation, and the barreness of those that are not cultivated, will be very much disposed to doubt, whether the whole average produce could possibly be doubled in twenty-five years from the present period. The only chance of success would be the ploughing up all the grazing countries, and putting an end almost entirely to the use of animal food. Yet a part of this scheme might defeat itself. The soil of England will not produce much without dressing; and cattle seem to be neces∣sary to make that species of manure, which best suits the land. In China, it is said, that the soil in some of the provinces is so fertile, as to produce two crops of rice in the year without dressing. None of the lands in England will answer to this description.</P>
<P>Difficult, however, as it might be, to double the average produce of the island in
<PB N="188" REF="204"/>
twenty-five years, let us suppose it effected. At the expiration of the first period there∣fore, the food, though almost entirely ve∣getable, would be sufficient to support in health, the doubled population of four∣teen millions.</P>
<P>During the next period of doubling, where will the food be found to satisfy the importunate demands of the increasing numbers. Where is the fresh land to turn up? where is the dressing neces∣sary to improve that which is already in cultivation? There is no person with the smallest knowledge of land, but would say, that it was impossible that the average produce of the country could be increased during the second twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what it at present yields. Yet we will suppose this increase, however im∣probable, to take place. The exuberant
<PB N="189" REF="205"/>
strength of the argument allows of almost any concession. Even with this conces∣sion, however, there would be seven mil∣lions at the expiration of the second term, unprovided for. A quantity of food equal to the frugal support of twenty-one mil∣lions, would be to be divided among twenty-eight millions.</P>
<P>Alas! what becomes of the picture where men lived in the midst of plenty: where no man was obliged to provide with anxiety and pain for his restless wants: where the narrow principle of selfishness did not exist: where Mind was delivered from her perpetual anxiety about corporal support, and free to expa∣tiate in the field of thought which is congenial to her. This beautiful fabric of imagination vanishes at the severe touch of truth. The spirit of benevolence, cherished and invigorated by plenty, is
<PB N="190" REF="206"/>
repressed by the chilling breath of want. The hateful passions that had vanished, reappear. The mighty law of self-pre∣servation, expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul. The temp∣tations to evil are too strong for hu∣man nature to resist. The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair pro∣portions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are imme∣diately generated. Provisions no longer flow in for the support of the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food. The rosy flush of health gives place to the pallid cheek and hollow eye of misery. Benevolence yet lingering in a few bosoms, makes some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint expiring struggles, till at length self-love resumes his wonted empire, and lords it triumphant over the world.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="207"/>
No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. God∣win ascribes the original sin of the worst men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. 8. C. 3. P. 340.</NOTE>. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, op∣pression, falsehood, misery, every hate∣ful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of all human regulations.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="208"/>
If we are not yet too well convinced of the reality of this melancholy pic∣ture, let us but look for a moment into the next period of twenty-five years; and we shall see twenty-eight millions of human beings without the means of support; and before the conclusion of the first century, the population would be one hundred and twelve millions, and the food only sufficient for thirty-five millions, leaving seventy-seven millions unprovided for. In these ages want would be indeed triumphant, and rapine and murder must reign at large: and yet all this time we are supposing the produce of the earth absolutely unli∣mited, and the yearly increase greater than the boldest speculator can ima∣gine.</P>
<P>This is undoubtedly a very different view of the difficulty arising from po∣pulation,
<PB N="193" REF="209"/>
from that which Mr. Godwin gives, when he says, <Q>Myriads of cen∣turies of still increasing population may pass away, and the earth be still found sufficient for the subsistence of its in∣habitants.</Q></P>
<P>I am sufficiently aware that the re∣dundant twenty-eight millions, or se∣venty-seven millions, that I have men∣tioned, could never have existed. It is a perfectly just observation of Mr. God∣win, that, <Q>There is a principle in hu∣man society, by which population is per∣petually kept down to the level of the means of subsistence.</Q> The sole ques∣tion is, what is this principle? Is it some obscure and occult cause? Is it some mysterious interference of heaven, which at a certain period, strikes the men with impotence, and the women with barrenness? Or is it a cause, open to
<PB N="194" REF="210"/>
our researches, within our view, a cause, which has constantly been observed to operate, though with varied force, in every state in which man has been placed? Is it not a degree of misery, the necessary and inevitable result of the laws of na∣ture, which human institutions, so far from aggravating, have tended consider∣ably to mitigate, though they never can remove.</P>
<P>It may be curious to observe, in the case that we have been supposing, how some of the laws which at present govern civilized society, would be successively dictated by the most imperious necessity. As man, according to Mr. Godwin, is the creature of the impressions to which he is subject, the goadings of want could not continue long, before some violations of public or private stock would neces∣sarily take place. As these violations
<PB N="195" REF="211"/>
increased in number and extent, the more active and comprehensive intellects of the society would soon perceive, that while population was fast increasing, the yearly produce of the country would shortly begin to diminish. The urgency of the case would suggest the necessity of some immediate measures to be taken for the general safety. Some kind of convention would then be called, and the dangerous situation of the country stated in the strongest terms. It would be observed, that while they lived in the midst of plenty, it was of little consequence who laboured the least, or who possessed the least, as every man was perfectly willing and ready to sup∣ply the wants of his neighbour. But that the question was no longer, whe∣ther one man should give to another, that which he did not use himself; but whether he should give to his neigh∣bour
<PB N="196" REF="212"/>
the food which was absolutely ne∣cessary to his own existence. It would be represented, that the number of those that were in want very greatly exceeded the number and means of those who should supply them: that these pressing wants, which from the state of the produce of the country could not all be gratified, had occasioned some flagrant violations of justice: that these violations had already checked the increase of food, and would, if they were not by some means or other prevented, throw the whole community in confusion: that imperious necessity seemed to dictate that a yearly increase of produce should, if possible, be ob∣tained at all events: that in order to effect this first, great, and indispensible purpose, it would be adviseable to make a more complete division of land, and to secure every man's stock against vio∣lation
<PB N="197" REF="213"/>
by the most powerful sanctions, even by death itself.</P>
<P>It might be urged perhaps by some objectors, that, as the fertility of the land increased, and various accidents occurred, the share of some men might be much more than sufficient for their support, and that when the reign of self-love was once established, they would not distribute their surplus produce without some com∣pensation in return. It would be ob∣served, in answer, that this was an in∣convenience greatly to be lamented; but that it was an evil which bore no com∣parison to the black train of distresses, that would inevitably be occasioned by the insecurity of property: that the quantity of food which one man could consume, was necessarily limited by the narrow capacity of the human stomach: that it was not certainly probable that he
<PB N="198" REF="214"/>
should throw away the rest; but that even if he exchanged his surplus food for the labour of others, and made them in some degree dependent on him, this would still be better than that these others should absolutely starve.</P>
<P>It seems highly probable, therefore, that an administration of property, not very different from that which prevails in civilized States at present, would be esta∣blished, as the best, though inadequate, remedy, for the evils which were pressing on the society.</P>
<P>The next subject that would come under discussion, intimately connected with the preceding, is, the commerce between the sexes. It would be urged by those who had turned their attention to the true cause of the difficulties under which the community laboured, that
<PB N="199" REF="215"/>
while every man felt secure that all his children would be well provided for by general benevolence, the powers of the earth would be absolutely inadequate to produce food for the population which would inevitably ensue: that even, if the whole attention and labour of the society were directed to this sole point, and if, by the most perfect security of property, and every other encourage∣ment that could be thought of, the greatest possible increase of produce were yearly obtained; yet still, that the in∣crease of food would by no means keep pace with the much more rapid increase of population: that some check to popu∣lation therefore was imperiously called for: that the most natural and obvious check seemed to be, to make every man provide for his own children: that this would operate in some respect, as a mea∣sure and guide, in the increase of popu∣lation;
<PB N="200" REF="216"/>
as it might be expected that no man would bring beings into the world, for whom he could not find the means of support: that where this notwithstand∣ing was the case, it seemed necessary, for the example of others, that the disgrace and inconvenience attending such a conduct, should fall upon that individual, who had thus inconsiderately plunged him∣self and innocent children in misery and want.</P>
<P>The institution of marriage, or at least, of some express or implied obligation on every man to support his own children, seems to be the natural result of these reasonings in a community under the dif∣ficulties that we have supposed.</P>
<P>The view of these difficulties, presents us with a very natural origin of the superior disgrace which attends a breach
<PB N="201" REF="217"/>
of chastity in the woman, than in the man. It could not be expected that women should have resources sufficient to support their own children. When therefore a woman was connected with a man, who had entered into no compact to maintain her children; and aware of the inconveniences that he might bring upon himself, had deserted her, these children must necessarily fall for support upon the society, or starve. And to pre∣vent the frequent recurrence of such an inconvenience, as it would be highly unjust to punish so natural a fault by personal restraint or infliction, the men might agree to punish it with disgrace. The offence is besides more obvious and conspicuous in the woman, and less lia∣ble to any mistake. The father of a child may not always be known, but the same uncertainty cannot easily exist with regard to the mother. Where, the evi∣dence
<PB N="202" REF="218"/>
of the offence was most complete, and the inconvenience to the society at the same time the greatest, there, it was agreed, that the largest share of blame should fall. The obligation on every man to maintain his children, the society would enforce, if there were occasion; and the greater degree of inconvenience or labour, to which a family would necessa∣rily subject him, added to some portion of disgrace which every human being must incur, who leads another into un∣happiness, might be considered as a suf∣ficient punishment for the man.</P>
<P>That a woman should at present be almost driven from society, for an offence, which men commit nearly with impu∣nity, seems to be undoubtedly a breach of natural justice. But the origin of the custom, as the most obvious and effec∣tual method of preventing the frequent
<PB N="203" REF="219"/>
recurrence of a serious inconvenience to a community, appears to be natural, though not perhaps perfectly justisiable. This origin, however, is now lost in the new train of ideas which the custom has since generated. What at first might be dictated by state necessity, is now sup∣ported by female delicacy; and operates with the greatest force on that part of society, where, if the original intention of the custom were preserved, there is the least real occasion for it.</P>
<P>When these two fundamental laws of society, the security of property, and the institution of marriage, were once esta∣blished, inequality of conditions must necessarily follow. Those who were born after the division of property, would come into a world already possessed. If their parents, from having too large a family, could not give them sufficient for
<PB N="204" REF="220"/>
their support, what are they to do in a world where every thing is appropriated? We have seen the fatal effects that would result to a society, if every man had a valid claim to an equal share of the pro∣duce of the earth. The members of a family which was grown too large for the original division of land appropriated to it, could not then demand a part of the surplus produce of others, as a debt of justice. It has appeared, that from the inevitable laws of our nature, some human beings must suffer from want. These are the unhappy persons who, in the great lottery of life, have drawn a blank. The number of these claimants would soon exceed the ability of the sur∣plus produce to supply. Moral merit is a very difficult distinguishing criterion, except in extreme cases. The owners of surplus produce would in general seek some more obvious mark of distinction.
<PB N="205" REF="221"/>
And it seems both natural and just, that except upon particular occasions, their choice should fall upon those, who were able, and professed themselves willing, to exert their strength in procuring a further surplus produce; and thus at once benefiting the community, and enabling these proprietors to afford assistance to greater numbers. All who were in want of food would be urged by imperious necessity to offer their labour in exchange for this article so absolutely essential to existence. The fund appropriated to the maintenance of labour, would be, the aggregate quantity of food possessed by the owners of land beyond their own consumption. When the demands upon this fund were great and numerous, it would naturally be divided in very small shares. Labour would be ill paid. Men would offer to work for a bare subsistence, and the rearing of families would be
<PB N="206" REF="222"/>
checked by sickness and misery. On the contrary, when this fund was increasing fast; when it was great in proportion to the number of claimants; it would be divided in much larger shares. No man would exchange his labour without re∣ceiving an ample quantity of food in return. Labourers would live in case and comfort; and would consequently be able to rear a numerous and vigorous off∣spring.</P>
<P>On the state of this fund, the happi∣ness, or the degree of misery, prevailing among the lower classes of people in every known State, at present chiefly depends. And on this happiness, or degree of misery, depends the increase, stationariness, or decrease of population.</P>
<P>And thus it appears, that a society con∣stituted according to the most beautiful
<PB N="207" REF="223"/>
form that imagination can conceive, with benevolence for its moving principle, in∣stead of self-love, and with every evil disposition in all its members corrected by reason and not force, would, from the inevitable laws of nature, and not from any original depravity of man, in a very short period, degenerate into a society, constructed upon a plan not essen∣tially different from that which prevails in every known State at present; I mean, a society divided into a class of pro∣prietors, and a class of labourers, and with self-love for the main-spring of the great machine.</P>
<P>In the supposition I have made, I have undoubtedly taken the increase of population smaller, and the increase of produce greater, than they really would be. No reason can be assigned, why, under the circumstances I have supposed,
<PB N="208" REF="224"/>
population should not increase faster than in any known instance. If then we were to take the period of doubling at fifteen years, instead of twenty-five years; and reflect upon the labour necessary to double the produce in so short a time, even if we allow it possible; we may venture to pronounce with certainty, that if Mr. Godwin's system of society was established in its utmost perfection, instead of myriads of centuries, not thirty years could elapse, before its utter de∣struction from the simple principle of population.</P>
<P>I have taken no notice of emigration for obvious reasons. If such societies were instituted in other parts of Europe, these countries would be under the same difficulties with regard to population, and could admit no fresh members into their bosoms. If this beautiful society were
<PB N="209" REF="225"/>
confined to this island, it must have de∣generated strangely from its original pu∣rity, and administer but a very small portion of the happiness it proposed; in short, its essential principle must be completely destroyed, before any of its members would voluntarily consent to leave it, and live under such govern∣ments as at present exist in Europe, or submit to the extreme hardships of first settlers in new regions. We well know, from repeated experience, how much misery and hardship men will undergo in their own country, before they can determine to desert it; and how often the most tempting proposals of embarking for new settlements have been rejected by people who appeared to be almost starving.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Godwin's conjecture concerning the future extinc∣tion of the passion between the sexes.—Little apparent grounds for such a conjecture.—Passion of love not inconsistent either with reason or virtue.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have supposed Mr. Godwin's sys∣tem of society once completely esta∣blished. But it is supposing an impos∣sibility. The same causes in nature which would destroy it so rapidly, were it once established, would prevent the possibility of its establishment. And upon what grounds we can presume a change in these natural causes, I am utterly at a loss to conjecture. No move towards the extinction of the passion between the sexes has taken place in the five or six thousand years that the world has existed. Men in the decline of life have, in all ages, declaimed against a passion which
<PB N="211" REF="227"/>
they have ceased to feel, but with as little reason as success. Those who from cold∣ness of constitutional temperament have never felt what love is, will surely be allowed to be very incompetent judges, with regard to the power of this passion, to contribute to the sum of pleasurable sensations in life. Those who have spent their youth in criminal excesses, and have prepared for themselves, as the com∣forts of their age, corporal debility, and mental remorse, may well inveigh against such pleasures as vain and sutile, and unproductive of lasting satisfaction. But the pleasures of pure love will bear the contemplation of the most improved rea∣son, and the most exalted virtue. Per∣haps there is scarcely a man who has once experienced the genuine delight of virtuous love, however great his intellec∣tual pleasures may have been, that does not look back to the period, as the sunny
<PB N="212" REF="228"/>
spot in his whole life, where his imagina∣tion loves to bask, which he recollects and contemplates with the fondest re∣grets, and which he would most wish to live over again. The superiority of in∣tellectual, to sensual pleasures, consists rather, in their filling up more time, in their having a larger range, and in their being less liable to satiety, than in their being more real and essential.</P>
<P>Intemperance in every enjoyment de∣feats its own purpose. A walk in the finest day, through the most beautiful country, if pursued too far, ends in pain and fatigue. The most wholesome and invigorating food, eaten with an unre∣strained appetite, produces weakness, in∣stead of strength. Even intellectual plea∣sures, though certainly less liable than others to satiety, pursued with too little intermission, debilitate the body, and
<PB N="213" REF="229"/>
impair the vigour of the mind. To argue against the reality of these pleasures from their abuse, seems to be hardly just. Morality, according to Mr. Godwin, is a calculation of consequences, or, as Archdeacon Paley very justly expresses it, the will of God, as collected from general expediency. According to either of these definitions, a sensual pleasure, not at∣tended with the probability of unhappy consequences, does not offend against the laws of morality: and if it be pursued with such a degree of temperance, as to leave the most ample room for intellec∣tual attainments, it must undoubtedly add to the sum of pleasurable sensations in life. Virtuous love, exalted by friend∣ship, seems to be that sort of mixture of sensual and intellectual enjoyment par∣ticularly suited to the nature of man, and most powerfully calculated to awaken
<PB N="214" REF="230"/>
the sympathies of the soul, and produce the most exquisite gratifications.</P>
<P>Mr. Godwin says, in order to shew the evident inferiority of the pleasures of sense, <Q>Strip the commerce of the sexes of all its attendant circumstances <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. 1. C. 5. P. 73.</NOTE>, and it would be generally despised.</Q> He might as well say to a man who admired trees; strip them of their spreading branches and lovely foliage, and what beauty can you see in a bare pole? But it was the tree with the branches and foliage, and not without them, that ex∣cited admiration. One feature of an ob∣ject, may be as distinct, and excite as different emotions, from the aggregate, as any two things the most remote, as a beautiful woman, and a map of Mada∣gascar. It is <Q>the symmetry of person,
<PB N="215" REF="231"/>
the vivacity, the voluptuous softness of temper, the affectionate kindness of feel∣ings, the imagination and the wit</Q> of a woman that excite the passion of love, and not the mere distinction of her being a female. Urged by the passion of love, men have been driven into acts highly prejudicial to the general interests of so∣ciety; but probably they would have sound no difficulty in resisting the temp∣tation, had it appeared in the form of a woman, with no other attractions what∣ever but her sex. To strip sensual plea∣sures of all their adjuncts, in order to prove their inferiority, is to deprive a magnet of some of its most essential causes of attraction, and then to say that it is weak and inefficient.</P>
<P>In the pursuit of every enjoyment, whether sensual or intellectual, Reason, that faculty which enables us to calculate
<PB N="216" REF="232"/>
consequences, is the proper corrective and guide. It is probable therefore that improved reason will always tend to pre∣vent the abuse of sensual pleasures, though it by no means follows that it will extinguish them.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to expose the fal∣lacy of that argument which infers an unlimited progress from a partial im∣provement, the limits of which cannot be exactly ascertained. It has appeared, I think, that there are many instances in which a decided progress has been ob∣served, where yet it would be a gross absurdity to suppose that progress inde∣finite. But towards the extinction of the passion between the sexes, no observable progress whatever has hitherto been made. To suppose such an extinction, therefore, is merely to offer an unfounded conjec∣ture,
<PB N="217" REF="233"/>
unsupported by any philosophical probabilities.</P>
<P>It is a truth, which history I am afraid makes too clear, that some men of the highest mental powers, have been ad∣dicted not only to a moderate, but even to an immoderate indulgence in the plea∣sures of sensual love. But allowing, as I should be inclined to do, notwithstanding numerous instances to the contrary, that great intellectual exertions tend to diminish the empire of this passion over man; it is evident that the mass of mankind must be improved more highly than the brightest ornaments of the species at present, before any difference can take place sufficient sensibly to affect popula∣tion. I would by no means suppose that the mass of mankind has reached its term of improvement; but the principal ar∣gument of this essay tends to place in a
<PB N="218" REF="234"/>
strong point of view, the improbability, that the lower classes of people in any country, should ever be sufficiently free from want and labour, to attain any high degree of intellectual improvement.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Godwin's conjectnre respecting the future approach of man towards immor∣tality on earth, seems to be rather oddly placed in a chapter, which professes to remove the objection to his system of equality from the principle of popula∣tion. Unless he supposes the passion be∣tween the sexes to decrease faster, than the duration of life increases, the earth would be more encumbered than ever. But leaving this difficulty to Mr. God∣win,
<PB N="220" REF="236"/>
let us examine a few of the ap∣pearances from which the probable im∣mortality of man is inferred.</P>
<P>To prove the power of the mind over the body, Mr. Godwin observes, <Q>How often do we find a piece of good news dissipating a distemper? How common is the remark that those accidents which are to the indolent a source of disease, are forgotten and extirpated in the busy and active? I walk twenty miles in an indolent and half determined temper, and am extremely fatigued. I walk twenty miles full of ardour, and with a motive that engrosses my soul, and I come in as fresh and as alert as when I began my journey. Emotions excited by some unexpected word, by a letter that is delivered to us, occasions the most extraordinary revolutions in our frame, accelerates the circulation, causes
<PB N="221" REF="237"/>
the heart to palpitate, the tongue to refuse its office, and has been known to occasion death by extreme anguish or extreme joy. There is nothing in∣deed of which the physician is more aware than of the power of the mind in assisting or retarding convalescence.</Q></P>
<P>The instances here mentioned, are chiefly instances of the effects of men∣tal stimulants on the bodily frame. No person has ever for a moment doubted the near, though mysterious connection, of mind and body. But it is arguing totally without knowledge of the na∣ture of stimulants to suppose, either that they can be applied continually with equal strength, or if they could be so applied, for a time, that they would not exhaust and wear out the subject. In some of the cases here noticed, the strength of the stimulus depends upon
<PB N="222" REF="238"/>
its novelty and unexpectedness. Such a stimulus cannot, from its nature, be re∣peated often with the same effect, as it would by repetition lose that pro∣perty which gives it its strength.</P>
<P>In the other cases, the argument is from a small and partial effect, to a great and general effect, which will in numberless instances be found to be a very fallacious mode of reasoning. The busy and active man may in some de∣gree counteract, or what is perhaps nearer the truth, may disregard those slight dis∣orders of frame, which fix the attention of a man who has nothing else to think of; but this does not tend to prove that activity of mind will enable a man to disregard a high fever, the small∣pox, or the plague.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="239"/>
The man who walks twenty miles with a motive that engrosses his soul, does not attend to his slight fatigue of body when he comes in; but double his mo∣tive, and set him to walk another twenty miles, quadruple it, and let him start a third time, and so on; and the length of his walk will ultimately depend upon muscle and not mind. Powel, for a mo∣tive of ten guineas, would have walked further probably than Mr. Godwin, for a motive of half a million. A motive of uncommon power acting upon a frame of moderate strength, would, perhaps, make the man kill himself by his exer∣tions, but it would not make him walk an hundred miles in twenty-four hours. This statement of the case, shews the fallacy of supposing, that the person was really not at all tired in his first walk of twenty miles, because he did not appear to be so, or, perhaps, scarcely
<PB N="224" REF="240"/>
felt any fatigue himself. The mind can∣not fix its attention strongly on more than one object at once. The twenty thousand pounds so engrossed his thoughts, that he did not attend to any slight sore∣ness of foot, or stiffness of limb. But had he been really as fresh and as alert, as when he first set off, he would be able to go the second twenty miles with as much ease as the first, and so on, the third, &amp;c. which leads to a palpable absurdity. When a horse of spirit is nearly half tired, by the stimulus of the spur, added to the proper manage∣ment of the bit, he may be put so much upon his mettle, that he would appear to a stander-by, as fresh and as high spirited, as if he had not gone a mile. Nay, probably, the horse himself, while in the heat and passion occasioned by this stimulus, would not feel any fatigue; but it would be strangely con∣trary
<PB N="225" REF="241"/>
to all reason and experience, to argue from such an appearance, that if the stimulus were continued, the horse would never be tired. The cry of a pack of hounds will make some horses, after a journey of forty miles on the road, appear as fresh, and as lively, as when they first set out. Were they then to be hunted, no perceptible abatement would at first be felt by their riders in their strength and spirits, but to∣wards the end of a hard day, the pre∣vious fatigue would have its full weight and effect, and make them tire sooner. When I have taken a long walk with my gun, and met with no success, I have frequently returned home feeling a considerable degree of uncomfortableness from fatigue. Another day, perhaps, going over nearly the same extent of ground with a good deal of sport, I have come home fresh, and alert. The
<PB N="226" REF="242"/>
difference in the sensation of fatigue upon coming in, on the different days, may have been very striking, but on the following mornings I have found no such difference. I have not perceived that I was less stiff in my limbs, or less foot∣sore, on the morning after the day of sport, than on the other morning.</P>
<P>In all these cases, stimulants upon the mind seem to act rather by taking off the attention from the bodily fatigue, than by really and truly counteracting it. If the energy of my mind had really counteracted the fatigue of my body, why should I feel tired the next morn∣ing? If the stimulus of the hounds had as completely overcome the fatigue of the journey in reality, as it did in ap∣pearance, why should the horse be tired sooner than if he had not gone the forty miles? I happen to have a very bad fit
<PB N="227" REF="243"/>
of the tooth-ache at the time I am wri∣ting this. In the eagerness of compo∣sition, I every now and then, for a mo∣ment or two, forget it. Yet I cannot help thinking that the process which causes the pain, is still going forwards, and that the nerves, which carry the in∣formation of it to the brain, are even during these moments demanding atten∣tion, and room for their appropriate vi∣brations. The multiplicity of vibrations of another kind, may perhaps prevent their admission, or overcome them for a time when admitted, till a shoot of ex∣traordinary energy puts all other vibra∣tions to the rout, destroys the vividness of my argumentative conceptions, and rides triumphant in the brain. In this case, as in the others, the mind seems to have little or no power in counter∣acting, or curing the disorder, but merely
<PB N="228" REF="244"/>
possesses a power, if strongly excited, of fixing its attention on other subjects.</P>
<P>I do not, however, mean to say, that a sound and vigorous mind has no ten∣dency whatever to keep the body in a similar state. So close and intimate is the union of mind and body, that it would be highly extraordinary, if they did not mutually assist each others func∣tions. But, perhaps, upon a comparison, the body has more effect upon the mind, than the mind upon the body. The first object of the mind is to act as purveyor to the wants of the body. When these wants are completely satisfied, an active mind is indeed apt to wander further, to range over the fields of science, or sport in the regions of imagination, to fancy that it has <Q>shuffled off this mortal coil,</Q> and is seeking its kindred element. But all these efforts are like
<PB N="229" REF="245"/>
the vain exertions of the hare in the fable. The slowly moving tortoise, the body, never fails to overtake the mind, however widely and extensively it may have ranged, and the brightest and most energetic intellects, unwillingly as they may attend to the first or second sum∣mons, must ultimately yield the em∣pire of the brain to the calls of hun∣ger, or sink with the exhausted body in sleep.</P>
<P>It seems as if one might say with certainty, that if a medicine could be sound to immortalize the body, there would be no fear of its being accom∣panied by the immortality of the mind. But the immortality of the mind by no means seems to infer the immortality of the body. On the contrary, the greatest conceivable energy of mind would probably exhaust and destroy
<PB N="230" REF="246"/>
the strength of the body. A temperate vigour of mind appears to be favoura∣ble to health; but very great intellec∣tual exertions tend rather, as has been often observed, to wear out the scab∣bard. Most of the instances which Mr. Godwin has brought to prove the power of the mind over the body, and the consequent probability of the immorta∣lity of man, are of this latter descrip∣tion, and could such stimulants be conti∣nually applied, instead of tending to im∣mortalize, they would tend very rapidly to destroy the human frame.</P>
<P>The probable increase of the volun∣tary power of man over his animal frame, comes next under Mr. Godwin's consideration, and he concludes by say∣ing, that the voluntary power of some men, in this respect, is found to ex∣tend to various articles in which other
<PB N="231" REF="247"/>
men are impotent. But this is reason∣ing against an almost universal rule from a few exceptions: and these ex∣ceptions seem to be rather tricks, than powers, that may be exerted to any good purpose. I have never heard of any man who could regulate his pulse in a fever; and doubt much, if any of the persons here alluded to, have made the smallest perceptible progress in the re∣gular correction of the disorders of their frames, and the consequent prolonga∣tion of their lives.</P>
<P>Mr. Godwin says, <Q>Nothing can be more unphilosophical, than to conclude, that, because a certain species of power is beyond the train of our present ob∣servation, that it is beyond the limits of the human mind.</Q> I own my ideas of philosophy are in this respect widely different from Mr. Godwin's. The only
<PB N="232" REF="248"/>
distinction that I see, between a philo∣sophical conjecture, and the assertions of the Prophet Mr. Brothers, is, that one is founded upon indications arising from the train of our present observa∣tions, and the other has no foundation at all. I expect that great discoveries are yet to take place in all the branches of human science, particularly in phy∣sics; but the moment we leave past experience as the foundation of our conjectures concerning the future; and still more, if our conjectures absolutely contradict past experience, we are thrown upon a wide field of uncertainty, and any one supposition is then just as good as another. If a person were to tell me that men would ultimately have eyes and hands behind them as well as before them, I should admit the usefulness of the addition, but should give as a reason for my disbelief of it, that I
<PB N="233" REF="249"/>
saw no indications whatever in the past, from which I could infer the smallest probability of such a change. If this be not allowed a valid objection, all conjectures are alike, and all equally philosophical. I own it appears to me, that in the train of our present observati∣ons, there are no more genuine indications that man will become immortal upon earth, than that he will have four eyes and four hands, or that trees will grow horizontally instead of perpendicularly.</P>
<P>It will be said, perhaps, that many discoveries have already taken place in the world that were totally unforeseen and unexpected. This I grant to be true; but if a person had predicted these discoveries, without being guided by any analogies or indications from past facts, he would deserve the name of seer or prophet, but not of philoso∣pher.
<PB N="234" REF="250"/>
The wonder that some of our modern discoveries would excite in the savage inhabitants of Europe in the times of Theseus and Achilles, proves but little. Persons almost entirely unacquaint∣ed with the powers of a machine, can∣not be expected to guess at its effects. I am far from saying, that we are at present by any means fully acquainted with the powers of the human mind; but we certainly know more of this in∣strument than was known four thousand years ago; and therefore, though not to be called competent judges, we are certainly much better able, than savages, to say what is, or is not, within its grasp. A watch would strike a Savage with as much surprize as a perpetual motion; yet one, is to us a most fa∣miliar piece of mechanism, and the other, has constantly eluded the efforts of the most acute intellects. In many
<PB N="235" REF="251"/>
instances, we are now able to perceive the causes, which prevent an unlimited im∣provement in those inventions, which seemed to promise fairly for it at first. The original improvers of telescopes would probably think, that as long as the size of the specula, and the length of the tubes could be increased, the powers and advantages of the instrument would increase: but experience has since taught us, that the smallness of the field, the deficiency of light, and the circumstance of the atmosphere being magnified, pre∣vent the beneficial results that were to be expected from telescopes of extraor∣dinary size and power. In many parts of knowledge, man has been almost con∣stantly making some progress; in other parts, his efforts have been invariably baffled. The Savage would not proba∣bly be able to guess at the causes of this mighty difference. Our further ex∣perience
<PB N="236" REF="252"/>
has given us some little in∣sight into these causes, and has there∣fore enabled us better to judge, if not, of what we are to expect in future, at least, of what we are not to expect, which, though negative, is a very useful piece of information.</P>
<P>As the necessity of sleep seems ra∣ther to depend upon the body than the mind, it does not appear how the improvement of the mind can tend very greatly to supersede this <Q>con∣spicuous infirmity.</Q> A man who by great excitements on his mind, is able to pass two or three nights without sleep, proportionably exhausts the vigour of his body: and this diminution of health and strength, will soon disturb the operations of his understanding; so that by these great efforts, he appears to have made no real progress whatever,
<PB N="237" REF="253"/>
in superseding the necessity of this spe∣cies of rest.</P>
<P>There is certainly a sufficiently mark∣ed difference in the various characters of which we have some knowledge, re∣lative to the energies of their minds, their benevolent pursuits, &amp;c. to enable us to judge, whether the operations of intellect have any decided effect in pro∣longing the duration of human life. It is certain, that no decided effect of this kind has yet been observed. Though no attention of any kind, has ever pro∣duced such an effect, as could be con∣strued into the smallest semblance of an approach towards immortality; yet of the two, a certain attention to the body, seems to have more effect in this respect, than an attention to the mind. The man who takes his temperate meals, and his bodily exercise, with scrupulous
<PB N="238" REF="254"/>
regularity, will generally be found more healthy, than the man who, very deeply engaged in intellectual pursuits, often forgets for a time these bodily cravings. The citizen who has retired, and whose ideas, perhaps, scarcely soar above, or extend beyond his little garden, pud∣ling all the morning about his borders of box, will, perhaps, live as long as the philosopher whose range of intel∣lect is the most exensive, and whose views are the clearest of any of his con∣temporaries. It has been positively ob∣served by those who have attended to the bills of mortality, that women live longer upon an average than men; and, though I would not by any means say that their intellectual faculties are in∣ferior, yet, I think, it must be allowed, that from their different education, there are not so many women as men, who
<PB N="239" REF="255"/>
are excited to vigorous mental exer∣tion.</P>
<P>As in these and similar instances, or to take a larger range, as in the great diversity of characters that have existed during some thousand years, no decided difference has been observed in the du∣ration of human life from the opera∣tion of intellect, the mortality of man on earth seems to be as completely established, and exactly upon the same grounds, as any one, the most constant, of the laws of nature. An immediate act of power in the Creator of the Uni∣verse might, indeed, change one or all of these laws, either suddenly or gra∣dually; but without some indications of such a change, and such indications do not exist, it is just as unphilosophical to suppose that the life of man may be prolonged beyond any assignable li∣mits,
<PB N="240" REF="256"/>
as to suppose that the attraction of the earth will gradually be changed into repulsion, and that stones will ul∣timately rise instead of fall, or that the earth will fly off at a certain pe∣riod to some more genial and warmer sun.</P>
<P>The conclusion of this chapter pre∣sents us, undoubtedly, with a very beau∣tiful and desireable picture, but like some of those landscapes, drawn from fancy, and not imagined with truth, it fails of that interest in the heart which nature and probability can alone give.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this subject without taking notice of these conjectures of Mr. Godwin and Mr. Condorcet, con∣cerning the indefinite prolongation of human life, as a very curious instance
<PB N="241" REF="257"/>
of the longing of the soul after immortality. Both these gentlemen have rejected the light of revelation which absolutely promises eternal life in another state. They have also re∣jected the light of natural religion, which to the ablest intellects in all ages, has indicated the future existence of the soul. Yet so congenial is the idea of immortality to the mind of man, that they cannot consent entirely to throw it out of their systems. After all their fastidious scepticisms concerning the only probable mode of immortality, they introduce a species of immortality of their own, not only completely con∣tradictory to every law of philosophical probability, but in itself in the highest degree, narrow, partial, and unjust. They suppose that all the great, virtuous, and exalted minds, that have ever existed, or that may exist for some thousands, per∣haps
<PB N="242" REF="258"/>
millions of years, will be sunk in annihilation; and that only a few be∣ings, not greater in number than can exist at once upon the earth, will be ultimately crowned with immortality. Had such a tenet been advanced as a tenet of revelation, I am very sure that all the enemies of religion, and probably Mr. Godwin, and Mr. Con∣dorcet among the rest, would have ex∣hausted the whole force of their ridi∣cule upon it, as the most puerile, the most absurd, the poorest, the most pitiful, the most iniquitously unjust, and, conse∣quently, the most unworthy of the Deity, that the superstitious folly of man could invent.</P>
<P>What a strange and curious proof do these conjectures exhibit of the incon∣sistency of scepticism! For it should be observed, that there is a very strik∣ing
<PB N="243" REF="259"/>
and essential difference, between be∣lieving an assertion which absolutely contradicts the most uniform experience, and an assertion which contradicts no∣thing, but is merely beyond the power of our present observation and know∣ledge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When we extend our view beyond this life, it is evident that we can have no other guides than authority, or conjecture, and perhaps, indeed, an obscure and undefined feeling. What I say here, therefore, does not appear to me in any respect to contradict what I said before, when I observed that it was unphilosophical to expect any specifick event that was not indicated by some kind of ana∣logy in the past. In ranging beyond the bourne from which no traveller returns, we must necessa∣rily quit this rule; but with regard to events that may be expected to happen on earth, we can sel∣dom quit it consistently with true philosophy. Ana∣logy has, however, as I conceive, great latitude. For instance, man has discovered many of the laws of nature: analogy seems to indicate that he will discover many more; but no analogy seems to indi∣cate that he will discover a sixth sense, or a new species of power in the human mind, entirely beyond the train of our present observations.</NOTE>. So diversified are the natural
<PB N="244" REF="260"/>
objects around us, so many instances of mighty power daily offer themselves to our view, that we may fairly pre∣sume, that there are many forms and operations of nature which we have not yet observed, or which, perhaps, we are not capable of observing with our pre∣sent confined inlets of knowledge. The resurrection of a spiritual body from a natural body, does not appear in itself a more wonderful instance of power, than the germination of a blade of wheat from the grain, or of an oak from an acorn. Could we conceive an intelligent be∣ing, so placed, as to be conversant only with inanimate, or full grown objects, and never to have witnessed the process of vegetation or growth; and were ano∣ther
<PB N="245" REF="261"/>
being to shew him two little pieces of matter, a grain of wheat, and an acorn, to desire him to examine them, to analize them if he pleased, and en∣deavour to find out their properties and essences; and then to tell him, that however trifling these little bits of mat∣ter might appear to him, that they pos∣sessed such curious powers of selection, combination, arrangement, and almost of creation, that upon being put into the ground, they would chuse, amongst all the dirt and moisture that surrounded them, those parts which best suited their purpose, that they would collect and ar∣range these parts with wonderful taste, judgment, and execution, and would rise up into beautiful forms, scarcely in any respect analogous to the little bits of matter which were first placed in the earth. I feel very little doubt that the imaginary being which I have
<PB N="246" REF="262"/>
supposed, would hesitate more, would require better authority, and stronger proofs, before he believed these strange assertions, than if he had been told, that a being of mighty power, who had been the cause of all that he saw around him, and of that existence of which he himself was conscious, would, by a great act of power upon the death and cor∣ruption of human creatures, raise up the essence of thought in an incorporeal, or at least invisible form, to give it a happier existence in another state.</P>
<P>The only difference, with regard to our own apprehensions, that is not in fa∣vour of the latter assertion, is, that the first miracle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The powers of selection, combination, and trans∣mutation, which every seed shews, are truely mira∣culous. Who can imagine that these wonderful fa∣culties are contained in these little bits of matter? To me it appears much more philosophical to sup∣pose that the mighty God of nature is present in full energy in all these operations. To this all powerful Being, it would be equally easy to raise an oak without an acorn as with one. The preparatory process of putting seeds into the ground, is merely ordained for the use of man, as one among the various other ex∣citements necessary to awaken matter into mind. It is an idea that will be found, consistent equally with the natural phenomena around us, with the various events of human life, and with the successive Revela∣tions of God to man, to suppose that the world is a mighty process for the creation and formation of mind. Many vessels will necessarily come out of this great furnace in wrong shapes. These will be broken and thrown aside as useless; while those vessels whose forms are full of truth, grace, and loveliness, will be wafted into happier situations, nearer the presence of the mighty maker.</NOTE> we have repeatedly seen,
<PB N="247" REF="263"/>
and the last miracle we have not seen. I admit the full weight of this prodigious difference; but surely no man can hesi∣tate a moment in saying, that putting Revelation out of the question, the re∣surrection
<PB N="248" REF="264"/>
of a spiritual body from a na∣tural body, which may be merely one among the many operations of nature which we cannot see, is an event inde∣finitely more probable than the immorta∣lity of man on earth, which is not only an event, of which no symptoms or indi∣cations have yet appeared, but is a posi∣tive contradiction to one of the most con∣stant of the laws of nature that has ever come within the observation of man.</P>
<P>I ought perhaps again to make an apo∣logy to my readers for dwelling so long upon a conjecture, which many I know will think too absurd and improbable, to require the least discussion. But if it be as improbable, and as contrary to the genuine spirit of philosophy as I own I think it is, why should it not be shewn to be so in a candid examination? A conjecture, however improbable on the
<PB N="249" REF="265"/>
first view of it, advanced by able and in∣genious men, seems at least to deserve investigation. For my own part I feel no disinclination whatever, to give that degree of credit to the opinion of the probable immortality of man on earth, which the appearances that can be brought in support of it deserve. Before we de∣cide upon the utter improbability of such an event, it is but fair impartially to ex∣amine these appearances; and from such an examination I think we may conclude, that we have rather less reason for sup∣posing that the life of man may be in∣definitely prolonged, than that trees may be made to grow indefinitely high, or potatoes indefinitely large <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though Mr. Godwin advances the idea of the indefinite prolongation of human life, merely as a conjecture, yet as he has produced some appearances, which in his conception favour the supposition, he must certainly intend that these appearances should be examined; and this is all that I have meant to do.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Error of Mr. Godwin in considering man too much in the light of a being merely rational.—In the com∣pound being, man, the passions will always act as disturbing forces in the decisions of the understand∣ing.—Reasonings of Mr. Godwin on the subject of coercion.—Some truths of a nature not to be commu∣nicated from one man to another.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the chapter which I have been exa∣amining, Mr. Godwin professes to con∣sider the objection to his system of equa∣lity from the principle of population. It has appeared I think clearly, that he is greatly erroneous in his statement of the distance of this difficulty; and that instead of myriads of centuries, it is really not thirty years, or even thirty days, distant from us. The supposition of the approach of man to immorta∣lity on earth, is certainly not of a kind to soften the difficulty. The only ar∣gument,
<PB N="251" REF="267"/>
therefore, in the chapter, which has any tendency to remove the objection, is the conjecture concerning the extinc∣tion of the passion between the sexes; but as this is a mere conjecture, unsup∣ported by the smallest shadow of proof, the force of the objection may be fairly said to remain unimpaired; and it is un∣doubtedly of sufficient weight of itself completely to overturn Mr. Godwin's whole system of equality. I will, how∣ever, make one or two observations on a few of the prominent parts of Mr. Godwin's reasonings, which will contri∣bute to place in a still clearer point of view, the little hope that we can rea∣sonably entertain of those vast improve∣ments in the nature of man and of so∣ciety, which he holds up to our admiring gaze in his political justice.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="268"/>
Mr. Godwin considers man too much in the light of a being merely intellec∣tual. This error, at least such I conceive it to be, pervades his whole work, and mixes itself with all his reasonings. The voluntary actions of men may originate in their opinions; but these opinions will be very differently modified in creatures compounded of a rational faculty and corporal propensities, from what they would be, in beings wholly intellectual. Mr. Godwin, in proving that sound rea∣soning and truth, are capable of being adequately communicated, examines the proposition first practically; and then adds, <Q>Such is the appearance which this pro∣position assumes, when examined in a loose and practical view. In strict con∣sideration it will not admit of debate. Man is a rational being, &amp;c <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B 1. C. 5. P. 89.</NOTE>.</Q> So far
<PB N="253" REF="269"/>
from calling this a strict consideration of the subject, I own I should call it the loosest, and most erroneous way possible, of considering it. It is the calculating the velocity of a falling body in vacuo; and persisting in it, that it would be the same through whatever resisting me∣diums it might fall. This was not New∣ton's mode of philosophizing. Very few general propositions are just in application to a particular subject. The moon is not kept in her orbit round the earth, nor the earth in her orbit round the sun, by a force that varies merely in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances. To make the general theory just in ap∣plication to the revolutions of these bo∣dies, it was necessary to calculate ac∣curately, the disturbing force of the sun upon the moon, and of the moon upon the earth; and till these disturbing forces were properly estimated, actual observations on the motions of these bodies, would have
<PB N="254" REF="270"/>
proved that the theory was not accu∣rately true.</P>
<P>I am willing to allow that every vo∣luntary act is preceded by a decision of the mind; but it is strangely opposite to what I should conceive to be the just theory upon the subject, and a pal∣pable contradiction to all experience, to say, that the corporal propensities of man do not act very powerfully, as disturb∣ing forces, in these decisions. The ques∣tion, therefore, does not merely depend, upon whether a man may be made to understand a distinct proposition, or be convinced by an unanswerable argument. A truth may be brought home to his conviction as a rational being, though he may determine to act contrary to it, as a compound being. The cravings of hunger, the love of liquor, the de∣sire of possessing a beautiful woman, will
<PB N="255" REF="271"/>
urge men to actions, of the fatal con∣sequences of which, to the general inte∣rests of society, they are perfectly well convinced, even at the very time they commit them. Remove their bodily cravings, and they would not hesitate a moment in determining against such actions. Ask them their opinion of the same conduct in another person, and they would immediately reprobate it. But in their own case, and under all the cir∣cumstances of their situation with these bodily cravings, the decision of the com∣pound being is different from the con∣viction of the rational being.</P>
<P>If this be the just view of the subject; and both theory and experience unite to prove that it is; almost all Mr. Godwin's reasonings on the subject of coercion in his 7th chapter, will appear to be founded on error. He spends some time in placing
<PB N="256" REF="272"/>
in a ridiculous point of view, the at∣tempt, to convince a man's understand∣ing, and to clear up a doubtful propo∣sition in his mind, by blows. Undoubt∣edly it is both ridiculous and barbarous; and so is cock-fighting; but one has little more to do with the real object of human punishments, than the other. One frequent (indeed much too frequent) mode of punishment is death. Mr. God∣win will hardly think this intended for conviction; at least it does not appear how the individual, or the society, could reap much future benefit from an un∣derstanding enlightened in this manner.</P>
<P>The principal objects which human pu∣nishments have in view, are undoubtedly restraint and example: restraint, or re∣moval of an individual member, whose vicious habits are likely to be prejudi∣cial to the society. And example, which
<PB N="257" REF="273"/>
by expressing the sense of the commu∣nity with regard to a particular crime, and by associating more nearly and vi∣sibly, crime and punishment, holds out a moral motive to dissuade others from the commission of it.</P>
<P>Restraint, Mr. Godwin thinks, may be permitted as a temporary expedient, though he reprobates solitary imprison∣ment, which has certainly been the most successful, and, indeed, almost the only attempt, towards the moral amelioration of offenders. He talks of the selfish pas∣sions that are fostered by solitude, and of the virtues generated in society. But surely these virtues are not generated in the society of a prison. Were the offender confined to the society of able and virtuous men, he would probably be more improved than in solitude. But is this practicable? Mr. Godwin's
<PB N="258" REF="274"/>
ingenuity is more frequently employed in finding out evils, than in suggesting prac∣tical remedies.</P>
<P>Punishment, for example, is totally reprobated. By endeavouring to make examples too impressive and terrible, na∣tions have, indeed, been led into the most barbarous cruelties; but the abuse of any practice is not a good argument against its use. The indefatigable pains taken in this country to find out a murder, and the certainty of its punishment, has powerfully contributed to generate that sentiment which is frequent in the mouths of the common people, that a murder will sooner or later come to light; and the habitual horror in which murder is in consequence held, will make a man, in the agony of passion, throw down his knife, for fear he should be tempted to use it in the gratification of his revenge.
<PB N="259" REF="275"/>
In Italy, where murderers by flying to a sanctuary, are allowed more frequently to escape, the crime has never been held in the same detestation, and has consequently been more frequent. No man, who is at all aware of the opera∣tion of moral motives, can doubt for a moment, that if every murder in Italy had been invariably punished, the use of the stilletto in transports of passion, would have been comparatively but lit∣tle known.</P>
<P>That human laws, either do, or can, proportion the punishment accurately to the offence, no person will have the folly to assert. From the inscrutability of motives the thing is absolutely im∣possible: but this imperfection, though it may be called a species of injustice, is no valid argument against human laws. It is the lot of man, that he will fre∣quently
<PB N="260" REF="276"/>
have to chuse between two evils; and it is a sufficient reason for the adop∣tion of any institution, that it is the best mode that suggests itself of preventing greater evils. A continual endeavour should undoubtedly prevail to make these institutions as perfect as the nature of them will admit. But nothing is so easy, as to find fault with human institutions; nothing so difficult, as to suggest ade∣quate practical improvements. It is to be lamented, that more men of talents employ their time in the former occu∣pation, than in the latter.</P>
<P>The frequency of crime among men, who, as the common saying is, know better, sufficiently proves, that some truths may be brought home to the conviction of the mind without always producing the proper effect upon the conduct. There are other truths of a
<PB N="261" REF="277"/>
nature that perhaps never can be ade∣quately communicated from one man to another. The superiority of the plea∣sures of intellect to those of sense, Mr. Godwin considers as a fundamental truth. Taking all circumstances into considera∣tion, I should be disposed to agree with him; but how am I to communicate this truth to a person who has scarcely ever felt intellectual pleasure. I may as well attempt to explain the nature and beauty of colours to a blind man. If I am ever so laborious, patient, and clear, and have the most repeated opportuni∣ties of expostulation, any real progress toward the accomplishment of my purpose, seems absolutely hopeless. There is no common measure between us. I can∣not proceed step by step: it is a truth of a nature absolutely incapable of demon∣stration. All that I can say is, that the wisest and best men in all ages had agreed
<PB N="262" REF="278"/>
in giving the preference, very greatly, to the pleasures of intellect; and that my own experience completely confirmed the truth of their decisions; that I had found sensual pleasures vain, transient, and con∣tinually attended with tedium and dis∣gust; but that intellectual pleasures ap∣peared to me ever fresh and young, filled up all my hours satisfactorily, gave a new zest to life, and diffused a lasting serenity over my mind. If he believe me, it can only be from respect and ve∣neration for my authority: it is credu∣lity, and not conviction. I have not said any thing, nor can any thing be said of a nature to produce real conviction. The affair is not an affair of reasoning, but of experience. He would probably observe in reply, what you say may be very true with regard to yourself and many other good men, but for my own part I feel very differently upon the subject. I have
<PB N="263" REF="279"/>
very frequently taken up a book, and al∣most as frequently gone to sleep over it; but when I pass an evening with a gay party, or a pretty woman, I feel alive, and in spirits, and truly enjoy my exist∣ence.</P>
<P>Under such circumstances, reasoning and argument are not instruments from which success can be expected. At some future time perhaps, real satiety of sensual pleasures, or some accidental impressions that awakened the energies of his mind, might effect that, in a month, which the most patient and able expostulations, might be incapable of effecting in forty years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Godwin's five propositions respecting political truth, on which his whole work hinges, not established.—Rea∣sons we have for supposing from the distress occasioned by the principle of population, that the vices, and moral weakness of man can never be wholly eradicated.—Perfectibility, in the sense in which Mr. Godwin uses the term, not applicable to man.—Nature of the real perfectibility of man illustrated.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF the reasonings of the preceding chap∣ter are just, the corollaries respecting poli∣tical truth, which Mr. Godwin draws from the proposition, that the voluntary actions of men originate in their opinions, will not appear to be clearly established. These corollaries are, <Q>Sound reasoning and truth, when adequately communi∣cated, must always be victorious over error: Sound reasoning and truth are capable of being so communicated: Truth is omnipotent: The vices and moral
<PB N="265" REF="281"/>
weakness of man are not invincible: Man is perfectible, or in other words, suscep∣tible of perpetual improvement.</Q></P>
<P>The first three propositions may be considered a complete syllogism. If by adequately communicated, be meant such a conviction as to produce an adequate effect upon the conduct; the major may be allowed, and the minor denied. The consequent, or the omnipotence of truth, of course falls to the ground. If by ade∣quately communicated be meant merely the conviction of the rational faculty; the major must be denied, the minor will be only true in cases capable of de∣monstration, and the consequent equally falls. The fourth proposition, Mr. God∣win calls the preceding proposition, with a slight variation in the statement. If so, it must accompany the preceding propo∣sition in its fall. But it may be worth
<PB N="266" REF="282"/>
while to inquire, with reference to the principal argument of this essay, into the particular reasons which we have for supposing, that the vices and moral weak∣ness of man can never be wholly over∣come in this world.</P>
<P>Man, according to Mr. Godwin, is a creature, formed what he is, by the suc∣cessive impressions which he has received, from the first moment that the germ from which he sprung was animated. Could he be placed in a situation, where he was sub∣ject to no evil impressions whatever, though it might be doubted whether in such a situation virtue could exist, vice would certainly be banished. The great bent of Mr. Godwin's work on political justice, if I understand it rightly, is to shew, that the greater part of the vices and weaknesses of men, procced from the injustice of their political and social
<PB N="267" REF="283"/>
institutions: and that if these were re∣moved, and the understandings of men more enlightened, there would be little or no temptation in the world to evil. As it has been clearly proved, however, (at least as I think) that this is entirely a false conception, and that, independent of any political or social institutions what∣ever, the greater part of mankind, from the fixed and unalterable laws of nature, must ever be subject to the evil tempta∣tions arising from want, besides other passions; it follows from Mr. Godwin's definition of man, that such impressions, and combinations of impressions, cannot be afloat in the world, without generat∣ing a variety of bad men. According to Mr. Godwin's own conception of the formation of character, it is surely as improbable that under such circum∣stances, all men will be virtuous, as that sixes will come up a hundred times
<PB N="268" REF="284"/>
following upon the dice. The great va∣riety of combinations upon the dice in a repeated succession of throws, appears to me not inaptly to represent the great variety of character that must necessarily exist in the world, supposing every individual to be formed what he is, by that combination of impressions which he has received since his first existence. And this comparison will, in some measure, shew the absurdity of supposing, that exceptions will ever be∣come general rules; that extraordinary and unusual combinations will be fre∣quent; or that the individual instances of great virtue which have appeared in all ages of the world, will ever prevail universally.</P>
<P>I am aware that Mr. Godwin might say, that the comparison is in one res∣pect inaccurate; that in the case of the
<PB N="269" REF="285"/>
dice, the preceding causes, or rather the chances respecting the preceding causes, were always the same; and that, there∣fore, I could have no good reason for supposing that a greater number of sixes would come up in the next hundred times of throwing, than in the preceding same number of throws. But, that man had in some sort a power of influencing those causes that formed character; and that every good and virtuous man that was produced, by the influence which he must necessarily have, rather increased the probability that another such virtuous character would be ge∣nerated; whereas the coming up of sixes upon the dice once, would cer∣tainly not increase the probability of their coming up a second time. I ad∣mit this objection to the accuracy of the comparison, but it is only partially
<PB N="270" REF="286"/>
valid. Repeated experience has assured us, that the influence of the most vir∣tuous character will rarely prevail against very strong temptations to evil. It will undoubtedly affect some, but it will fail with a much greater number. Had Mr. Godwin succeeded in his attempt to prove that these temptations to evil could by the exertions of man be re∣moved, I would give up the compari∣son; or at least allow, that a man might be so far enlightened with re∣gard to the mode of shaking his elbow, that he would be able to throw sixes every time. But as long as a great number of those impressions which form character, like the nice motions of the arm, remain absolutely independent of the will of man; though it would be the height of folly and presumption, to attempt to calculate the relative pro∣portions
<PB N="271" REF="287"/>
of virtue and vice at the fu∣ture periods of the world; it may be safely asserted, that the vices and moral weakness of mankind, taken in the mass, are invincible.</P>
<P>The fifth proposition, is the general deduction from the four former, and will consequently fall, as the founda∣tions which support it have given way. In the sense in which Mr. Godwin understands the term perfectible, the perfectibility of man cannot be asserted, unless the preceding propositions could have been clearly established. There is, however, one sense, which the term will bear, in which it is, perhaps, just. It may be said with truth, that man is always susceptible of improvement; or that there never has been, or will be, a period of his history, in which he can be said to have reached his possi∣ble
<PB N="272" REF="288"/>
achmè of perfection. Yet it does not by any means follow from this, that our efforts to improve man will always succeed; or even, that he will ever make, in the greatest number of ages, any extraordinary strides towards perfection. The only inference that can be drawn, is, that the precise li∣mit of his improvement cannot possibly be known. And I cannot help again reminding the reader of a distinction, which, it appears to me, ought parti∣cularly to be attended to in the pre∣sent question; I mean, the essential dif∣ference there is, between an unlimited improvement, and an improvement the limit of which cannot be ascertained. The former is an improvement not ap∣plicable to man under the present laws of his nature. The latter, undoubtedly, is applicable.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="289"/>
The real perfectibility of man may be illustrated, as I have mentioned before, by the perfectibility of a plant. The object of the enterprizing florist, is, as I conceive, to unite size, symmetry, and beauty of colour. It would surely be pre∣sumptuous in the most. successful im∣prover to affirm, that he possessed a carnation in which these qualities existed in the greatest possible state of perfec∣tion. However beautiful his flower may be, other care, other soil, or other suns, might produce one still more beautiful. Yet, although he may be aware of the absurdity of supposing that he has reached perfection; and though he may know by what means he attained that degree of beauty in the flower which he at present possesses, yet he cannot be sure that by pursuing similar means, rather increased in strength, he will obtain a more beautiful blossom. By endea∣vouring
<PB N="274" REF="290"/>
to improve one quality, he may impair the beauty of another. The richer mould which he would employ to increase the size of his plant, would probably burst the calyx, and destroy at once its symmetry. In a similar manner, the forcing manure used to bring about the French revo∣lution, and to give a greater freedom and energy to the human mind, has burst the calyx of humanity, the res∣training bond of all society; and, however large the separate petals have grown; however strongly, or even beautifully a few of them have been marked; the whole is at present a loose, deformed, disjointed mass, without union, symmetry, or harmony of colour∣ing.</P>
<P>Were it of consequence to improve pinks and carnations, though we could
<PB N="275" REF="291"/>
have no hope of raising them as large as cabbages, we might undoubtedly ex∣pect, by successive efforts, to obtain more beautiful specimens than we at present possess. No person can deny the im∣portance of improving the happiness of the human species. Every, the least advance in this respect, is highly valu∣able. But an experiment with the hu∣man race is not like an experiment upon inanimate objects. The bursting of a flower may be a trifle. Another will soon succeed it. But the bursting of the bonds of society is such a se∣paration of parts as cannot take place without giving the most acute pain to thousands: and a long time may clapse, and much misery may be endured, be∣fore the wound grows up again.</P>
<P>As the five propositions which I have been examining may be considered as
<PB N="276" REF="292"/>
the corner stones of Mr. Godwin's fan∣ciful structure; and, indeed, as expres∣sing the aim and bent of his whole work; however excellent much of his detached reasoning may be, he must be considered as having failed in the great object of his undertaking. Be∣sides the difficulties arising from the compound nature of man, which he has by no means sufficiently smoothed; the principal argument against the perfec∣tibility of man and society remains whole and unimpaired from any thing that he has advanced. And as far as I can trust my own judgment, this ar∣gument appears to be conclusive, not only against the perfectibility of man, in the enlarged sense in which Mr. Godwin understands the term, but against any very marked and striking change for the better, in the form and struc∣ture of general society; by which I
<PB N="277" REF="293"/>
mean, any great and decided ameliora∣tion of the condition of the lower classes of mankind, the most numerous, and, consequently, in a general view of the subject, the most important part of the human race. Were I to live a thou∣sand years, and the laws of nature to remain the same, I should little fear, or rather little hope, a contradiction from experience, in asserting, that no possible sacrifices or exertions of the rich, in a country which had been long inhabited, could for any time place the lower classes of the community in a situation equal, with regard to cir∣cumstances, to the situation of the com∣mon people, about thirty years ago, in the northern States of America.</P>
<P>The lower classes of people in Eu∣rope may, at some future period, be much better instructed than they are
<PB N="278" REF="294"/>
at present; they may be taught to employ the little spare time they have in many better ways than at the ale∣house; they may live under better and more equal laws than they have ever hitherto done, perhaps, in any country; and I even conceive it possible, though not probable, that they may have more leisure; but it is not in the nature of things, that they can be awarded such a quantity of money or subsistence, as will allow them all to marry early, in the full confidence that they shall be able to provide with ease for a nume∣rous family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Models too perfect, may sometimes rather impede than pro∣mote improvement.—Mr. Godwin's essay on avarice and profusion.—Impossibility of dividing the necessary labour of a society amicably among all.—Invectives against la∣bour may produce present evil, with little or no chance of producing future good.—An accession to the mass of agricultural labour must always be an advantage to the labourer.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Godwin in the preface to his En∣quirer, drops a few expressions which seem to hint at some change in his opi∣nions since he wrote the Political Justice; and as this is a work now of some years standing, I should certainly think, that I had been arguing against opinions, which the author had himself seen reason to alter, but that in some of the essays of the Enquirer, Mr. Godwin's peculiar mode of thinking, appears in as striking a light as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="296"/>
It has been frequently observed, that though we cannot hope to reach perfection in any thing, yet that it must always be ad∣vantageous to us, to place before our eyes the most perfect models. This observa∣tion has a plausible appearance, but is very far from being generally true. I even doubt its truth in one of the most obvious exemplifications that would occur. I doubt whether a very young painter would receive so much benefit, from an attempt to copy a highly finished and perfect picture, as from copying one where the outlines were more strongly marked, and the manner of laying on the colours was more easily discoverable. But in cases, where the perfection of the model, is a perfection of a different and superior nature from that, towards which we should naturally advance, we shall not only always fail in making any progress towards it, but we shall
<PB N="281" REF="297"/>
in all probability impede the progress, which we might have expected to make, had we not fixed our eyes upon so perfect a model. A highly intellectual being, exempt from the infirm calls of hunger or sleep, is undoubtedly a much more perfect existence than man: but were man to at∣tempt to copy such a model, he would not only fail in making any advances towards it; but by unwisely straining to imitate what was inimitable, he would probably de∣stroy the little intellect which he was en∣deavouring to improve.</P>
<P>The form and structure of society which Mr. Godwin describes, is as es∣sentially distinct from any forms of so∣ciety which have hitherto prevailed in the world, as a being that can live with∣out food or sleep is from a man. By improving society in its present form, we are making no more advances to∣wards
<PB N="282" REF="298"/>
such a state of things as he pic∣tures, than we should make approaches towards a line, with regard to which we were walking parallel. The question, therefore is, whether, by looking to such a form of society as our polar star, we are likely to advance or retard the improve∣ment of the human species? Mr. God∣win appears to me to have decided this question against himself in his essay on avarice and profusion in the Enquirer.</P>
<P>Dr. Adam Smith has very justly ob∣served, that nations, as well as indivi∣duals, grow rich by parsimony, and poor by profusion; and that, therefore, every frugal man was a friend, and every spend∣thrift an enemy to his country. The rea∣son he gives is, that what is saved from revenue is always added to stock, and is therefore taken from the maintenance of labour that is generally unproduc∣tive,
<PB N="283" REF="299"/>
and employed in the maintenance of labour that realizes itself in valuable commodities. No observation can be more evidently just. The subject of Mr. Godwin's essay is a little similar in its first appearance, but in essence is as distinct as possible. He considers the mischief of profusion, as an acknowledged truth; and therefore makes his compa∣rison between the avaricious man, and the man who spends his income. But the avaricious man of Mr. Godwin, is totally a distinct character, at least with regard to his effect upon the prosperity of the state, from the frugal man of Dr. Adam Smith. The frugal man in order to make more money, saves from his income, and adds to his capital; and this capital he either employs him∣self in the maintenance of productive labour, or he lends it to some other per∣son, who will probably employ it in this
<PB N="284" REF="300"/>
way. He benefits the state, because he adds to its general capital; and because wealth employed as capital, not only sets in motion more labour, than when spent as income, but the labour is be∣sides of a more valuable kind. But the avaricious man of Mr. Godwin locks up his wealth in a chest, and sets in mo∣tion no labour of any kind, either pro∣ductive or unproductive. This is so es∣sential a difference, that Mr. Godwin's decision in his essay, appears at once as evidently false, as Dr. Adam Smith's position is evidently true. It could not, indeed, but occur to Mr. Godwin, that some present inconvenience might arise to the poor, from thus locking up the funds destined for the maintenance of labour. The only way, therefore, he had of weakening this objection, was to com∣pare the two characters chiefly with re∣gard to their tendency to accelerate the
<PB N="285" REF="301"/>
approach of that happy state of culti∣vated equality, on which he says we ought always to fix our eyes as our polar star.</P>
<P>I think it has been proved in the for∣mer parts of this essay, that such a state of society is absolutely impractica∣ble. What consequences then are we to expect from looking to such a point, as our guide and polar star, in the great sea of political discovery? Reason would teach us to expect no other, than winds perpetually adverse, constant but fruit∣less toil, frequent shipwreck, and cer∣tain misery. We shall not only fail in making the smallest real approach to∣wards such a perfect form of society; but by wasting our strength of mind and body, in a direction in which it is impossible to proceed, and by the frequent distress which we must necessarily occasion by
<PB N="286" REF="302"/>
our repeated failures, we shall evidently im∣pede that degree of improvement in so∣ciety, which is really attainable.</P>
<P>It has appeared that a society consti∣tuted according to Mr. Godwin's system, must, from the inevitable laws of our nature, degenerate into a class of pro∣prietors, and a class of labourers; and that the substitution of benevolence, for self-love, as the moving principle of so∣ciety, instead of producing the happy effects that might be expected from so fair a name, would cause the same pres∣sure of want to be felt by the whole of society, which is now felt only by a part. It is to the established administration of property, and to the apparently narrow principle of self-love, that we are in∣debted for all the noblest exertions of human genius, all the finer and more delicate emotions of the soul, for every
<PB N="287" REF="303"/>
thing, indeed, that distinguishes the ci∣vilized, from the savage state; and no sufficient change, has as yet taken place in the nature of civilized man, to ena∣ble us to say, that he either is, or ever will be, in a state, when he may safely throw down the ladder by which he has risen to this eminence.</P>
<P>If in every society that has advanced beyond the savage state, a class of pro∣prietors, and a class of labourers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It should be observed, that the principal argument of this essay, only goes to prove the necessity of a class of proprietors, and a class of labourers, but by no means infers, that the present great inequality of property, is either necessary or useful to society. On the contrary, it must certainly be considered as an evil, and every institution that promotes it, is essen∣tially bad and impolitic. But whether a government could with advantage to society actively interfere to repress inequality of fortunes, may be a matter of doubt. Perhaps the generous system of perfect li∣berty, adopted by Dr. Adam Smith, and the French oeconomists, would be ill exchanged for any system of restraint.</NOTE>, must
<PB N="288" REF="304"/>
necessarily exist, it is evident, that, as labour is the only property of the class of labourers, every thing that tends to diminish the value of this property, must tend to diminish the possessions of this part of society. The only way that a poor man has of supporting himself in inde∣pendence, is by the exertion of his bo∣dily strength. This is the only commo∣dity he has to give in exchange for the necessaries of life. It would hardly appear then that you benefit him, by narrowing the market for this commo∣dity, by decreasing the demand for la∣bour, and lessening the value of the only property that he possesses.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="305"/>
Mr. Godwin would perhaps say, that the whole system of barter and exchange, is a vile and iniquitous traffic. If you would essentially relieve the poor man, you should take a part of his labour upon yourself, or give him your money, without exacting so severe a return for it. In answer to the first method pro∣posed, it may be observed, that even if the rich could be persuaded to assist the poor in this way, the value of the assistance would be comparatively trifling. The rich, though they think themselves of great importance, bear but a small proportion in point of numbers to the poor, and would, therefore, relieve them but of a small part of their burdens by taking a share. Were all those that are employed in the labours of luxuries, added to the number of those employed in producing necessaries; and could these necessary labours be amicably divided
<PB N="290" REF="306"/>
among all, each man's share might in∣deed be comparatively light; but desire∣able as such an amicable division would undoubtedly be, I cannot conceive any practical principle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Godwin seems to have but little respect for practical principles; but I own it appears to me, that he is a much greater benefactor to mankind, who points out how an inferior good may be attained, than he who merely expatiates on the deformity of the present state of society, and the beauty of a different state, without pointing out a practical method, that might be immedi∣ately applied, of accelerating our advances from the one, to the other.</NOTE> according to which it could take place. It has been shewn, that the spirit of benevolence, guided by the strict impartial justice that Mr. God∣win describes, would, if vigorously acted upon, depress in want and misery the whole human race. Let us examine what would be the consequence, if the pro∣prietor were to retain a decent share for himself; but to give the rest away to
<PB N="291" REF="307"/>
the poor, without exacting a task from them in return. Not to mention the idleness and the vice that such a pro∣ceeding, if general, would probably create in the present state of society, and the great risk there would be, of diminishing the produce of land, as well as the la∣bours of luxury, another objection yet remains.</P>
<P>It has appeared that from the princi∣ple of population, more will always be in want than can be adequately supplied. The surplus of the rich man might be sufficient for three, but four will be de∣sirous to obtain it. He cannot make this selection of three out of the four, with∣out conferring a great favour on those that are the objects of his choice. These persons must consider themselves as under a great obligation to him, and as de∣pendent upon him for their support.
<PB N="292" REF="308"/>
The rich man would feel his power, and the poor man his dependence; and the evil effects of these two impressions on the human heart are well known. Though I perfectly agree with Mr. Godwin there∣fore in the evil of hard labour; yet I still think it a less evil, and less calculated to debase the human mind, than depend∣ence; and every history of man that we have ever read, places in a strong point of view, the danger to which that mind is exposed, which is intrusted with constant power.</P>
<P>In the present state of things, and particularly when labour is in request, the man who does a days work for me, consers full as great an obligation upon me, as I do upon him. I possess what he wants; he possesses what I want. We make an amicable exchange. The
<PB N="293" REF="309"/>
poor man walks erect in conscious in∣dependence; and the mind of his em∣ployer is not vitiated by a sense of power.</P>
<P>Three or four hundred years ago, there was undoubtedly much less la∣bour in England, in proportion to the population, than at present; but there was much more dependence: and we probably should not now enjoy our present degree of civil liberty, if the poor, by the introduction of manufac∣tures, had not been enabled to give something in exchange for the provi∣sions of the great Lords, instead of be∣ing dependent upon their bounty. Even the greatest enemies of trade and ma∣nufactures, and I do not reckon my∣self a very determined friend to them, must allow, that when they were in∣troduced
<PB N="294" REF="310"/>
into England, liberty came in their train.</P>
<P>Nothing that has been said, tends in the most remote degree to undervalue the principle of benevolence. It is one of the noblest and most godlike quali∣ties of the human heart, generated per∣haps, slowly and gradually from self-love; and afterwards intended to act as a general law, whose kind office it should be, to soften the partial deformities, to correct the as∣perities, and to smooth the wrinkles of its parent: and this seems to be the analogy of all nature. Perhaps there is no one general law of nature that will not ap∣pear, to us at least, to produce partial evil; and we frequently observe at the same time, some bountiful provision, which acting as another general law, corrects the inequalities of the first.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="311"/>
The proper office of benevolence is to soften the partial evils arising from self∣love, but it can never be substituted in its place. If no man were to allow him∣self to act, till he had completely deter∣mined, that the action he was about to perform, was more conducive than any other to the general good, the most en∣lightened minds would hesitate in per∣plexity and amazement; and the un∣enlightened, would be continually com∣mitting the grossest mistakes.</P>
<P>As Mr. Godwin, therefore, has not laid down any practical principle, according to which the necessary labours of agricul∣ture might be amicably shared among the whole class of labourers; by general in∣vectives against employing the poor, he appears to pursue an unattainable good through much present evil. For if every man who employs the poor, ought to be
<PB N="296" REF="312"/>
considered as their enemy, and as adding to the weight of their oppressions; and if the miser is, for this reason, to be pre∣ferred to the man who spends his income, it follows, that any number of men who now spend their incomes, might, to the advantage of society, be converted into misers. Suppose then, that a hundred thousand persons who now employ ten men each, were to lock up their wealth from general use, it is evident, that a million of working men of different kinds would be completely thrown out of all employment. The extensive mi∣sery that such an event would produce in the present state of society, Mr. Godwin himself could hardly refuse to acknowledge; and I question whether he might not find some difficulty in proving, that a conduct of this kind tended more than the conduct of those who spend their incomes to <Q>place
<PB N="297" REF="313"/>
human beings in the condition in which they ought to be placed.</Q></P>
<P>But Mr. Godwin says, that the miser really locks up nothing; that the point has not been rightly understood; and that the true development and defini∣tion of the nature of wealth have not been applied to illustrate it. Having defined therefore wealth, very justly, to be the commodities raised and fostered by human labour, he observes, that the miser locks up neither corn, nor oxen, nor clothes, nor houses. Undoubtedly he does not really lock up these arti∣cles, but he locks up the power of producing them, which is virtually the same. These things are certainly used and consumed by his contemporaries, as truly, and to as great an extent, as if he were a beggar; but not to as great an ex∣tent, as if he had employed his wealth, in turning up more land, in breeding more
<PB N="298" REF="314"/>
oxen, in employing more taylors, and in building more houses. But supposing, for a moment, that the conduct of the miser did not tend to check any really useful produce, how are all those, who are thrown out of employment, to obtain patents which they may shew in order to be awarded a proper share of the food and raiment produced by the so∣ciety? This is the unconquerable diffi∣culty.</P>
<P>I am perfectly willing to concede to Mr. Godwin that there is much more labour in the world than is really ne∣cessary; and that, if the lower classes of society could agree among themselves never to work more than six or seven hours in the day, the commodities es∣sential to human happiness might still be produced in as great abundance as at present. But it is almost impossible to
<PB N="299" REF="315"/>
that such an agreement could be adhered to. From the principle of population, some would necessarily be more in want than others. Those that had large families, would naturally be desirous of exchanging two hours more of their labour for an ampler quantity of subsistence. How are they to be prevented from making this exchange? It would be a violation of the first and most sacred property that a man pos∣sesses, to attempt, by positive institutions, to interfere with his command over his own labour.</P>
<P>Till Mr. Godwin, therefore, can point out some practical plan according to which the necessary labour in a society might be equitably divided; his invec∣tives against labour, if they were at∣tended to, would certainly produce much present evil, without approximating us

to that state of cultivated equality to which he looks forward as his polar star; and which, he seems to think, should at present be our guide in determining the nature and tendency of human actions. A mariner guided by such a polar star is in danger of shipwreck.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is no possible way in which wealth could, in general, be em∣ployed so beneficially to a state, and particularly to the lower orders of it, as by improving and rendering productive that land, which to a farmer would not answer the expence of cultivation. Had Mr. Godwin exerted his energetic elo∣quence in painting the superior worth and usefulness of the character who employed the poor in this way, to him who employed them in narrow luxu∣ries, every enlightened man must have applauded his efforts. The increasing
<PB N="301" REF="317"/>
demand for agricultural labour must always tend to better the condition of the poor; and if the accession of work be of this kind, so far is it from being true, that the poor would be obliged to work ten hours, for the same price, that they before worked eight, that the very reverse would be the fact; and a labourer might then support his wife and family as well by the labour of six hours, as he could before by the la∣bour of eight.</P>
<P>The labour created by luxuries, though useful in distributing the produce of the country, without vitiating the proprietor by power, or debasing the labourer by dependence, has not, indeed, the same beneficial effects on the state of the poor. A great accession of work from manufactures, though it may raise the price of labour even more than an in∣creasing demand for agricultural labour;
<PB N="302" REF="318"/>
yet, as in this case, the quantity of food in the country may not be pro∣portionably increasing, the advantage to the poor will be but temporary, as the price of provisions must necessarily rise in proportion to the price of labour. Relative to this subject, I cannot avoid venturing a few remarks on a part of Dr. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations; speaking at the same time with that diffidence, which I ought certainly to feel, in differing from a person so justly celebrated in the political world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Probable error of Dr. Adam Smith in representing every increase of the revenue or stock of a society as an increase in the funds for the maintenance of labour.—Instances where an increase of wealth can have no tendency to better the condition of the labouring poor.—England has increased in riches without a proportional increase in the funds for the maintenance of labour.—The state of the poor in China would not be improved by an in∣crease of wealth from manufactures.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE professed object of Dr. Adam Smith's inquiry, is, the nature and causes of the wealth of nations. There is ano∣ther inquiry, however, perhaps still more interesting, which he occasionally mixes with it; I mean an inquiry into the causes which affect the happiness of nations, or the happiness and comfort of the lower orders of society, which is the most numerous class in every na∣tion. I am sufficiently aware of the
<PB N="304" REF="320"/>
near connection of these two subjects, and that the causes which tend to in∣crease the wealth of a State, tend also, generally speaking, to increase the hap∣piness of the lower classes of the peo∣ple. But perhaps Dr. Adam Smith has considered these two inquiries as still more nearly connected than they really are; at least, he has not stopped to take notice of those instances, where the wealth of a society may increase (according to his definition of wealth) without having any tendency to increase the comforts of the labouring part of it. I do not mean to enter into a philosophical discussion of what con∣stitutes the proper happiness of man; but shall merely consider two univer∣sally acknowledged ingredients, health, and the command of the necessaries and conveniences of life.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="321"/>
Little or no doubt can exist, that the comforts of the labouring poor de∣pend upon the increase of the funds destined for the maintenance of labour; and will be very exactly in proportion to the rapidity of this increase. The demand for labour which such increase would occasion, by creating a compe∣tition in the market, must necessarily raise the value of labour; and, till the additional number of hands required were reared, the increased funds would be distributed to the same number of persons as before the increase, and therefore every labourer would live com∣paratively at his ease. But perhaps Dr. Adam Smith errs in representing every increase of the revenue or stock of a society as an increase of these funds. Such surplus stock or revenue will, in∣deed, always be considered by the in∣dividual possessing it, as an additional
<PB N="306" REF="322"/>
fund from which he may maintain more labour: but it will not be a real and effectual fund for the maintenance of an additional number of labourers, unless the whole, or at least a great part of this increase of the stock or revenue of the society, be convertible into a pro∣portional quantity of provisions; and it will not be so convertible, where the increase has arisen merely from the produce of labour, and not from the produce of land. A distinction will in this case occur, between the number of hands which the stock of the society could employ, and the number which its territory can maintain.</P>
<P>To explain myself by an instance. Dr. Adam Smith defines the wealth of a nation to consist in the annual pro∣duce of its land and labour. This de∣finition evidently includes manufactured
<PB N="307" REF="323"/>
produce, as well as the produce of the land. Now supposing a nation, for a course of years, was to add what it saved from its yearly revenue, to its manufac∣turing capital solely, and not to its ca∣pital employed upon land, it is evident, that it might grow richer according to the above definition, without a power of supporting a greater number of la∣bourers, and therefore, without an in∣crease in the real funds for the mainte∣nance of labour. There would, not∣withstanding, be a demand for labour, from the power which each manufac∣turer would possess, or at least think he possessed, of extending his old stock in trade, or of setting up fresh works. This demand would of course raise the price of labour; but if the yearly stock of provisions in the country was not increasing, this rise would soon turn out to be merely nominal, as the price of pro∣visions
<PB N="308" REF="324"/>
must necessarily rise with it. The demand for manufacturing labourers might, indeed, entice many from agri∣culture, and thus tend to diminish the annual produce of the land; but we will suppose any effect of this kind to be compensated by improvements in the instruments of agriculture, and the quan∣tity of provisions therefore to remain the same. Improvements in manufac∣turing machinery would of course take place; and this circumstance, added to the greater number of hands employed in manufactures, would cause the annual produce of the labour of the country to be upon the whole greatly increased. The wealth therefore of the country would be increasing annually, accord∣ing to the definition, and might not, perhaps, be increasing very slowly.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="325"/>
The question is, whether wealth, in∣creasing in this way, has any tendency to better the condition of the labour∣ing poor. It is a self-evident proposi∣tion, that any general rise in the price of labour, the stock of provisions re∣maining the same, can only be a no∣minal rise, as it must very shortly be followed by a proportional rise in pro∣visions. The increase in the price of labour therefore, which we have sup∣posed, would have little or no effect in giving the labouring poor a greater command over the necessaries and con∣veniences of life. In this respect they would be nearly in the same state as before. In one other respect they would be in a worse state. A greater pro∣portion of them would be employed in manufactures, and fewer, consequently, in agriculture. And this exchange of professions will be allowed, I think, by
<PB N="310" REF="326"/>
all, to be very unfavourable in respect of health, one essential ingredient of happiness, besides the greater uncer∣tainty of manufacturing labour, arising from the capricious taste of man, the accidents of war, and other causes.</P>
<P>It may be said, perhaps, that such an instance as I have supposed could not occur, because the rise in the price of provisions would immediately turn some additional capital into the chan∣nel of agriculture. But this is an event which may take place very slowly, as it should be remarked, that a rise in the price of labour, had preceded the rise of provisions, and would, therefore, impede the good effects upon agricul∣ture, which the increased value of the produce of the land might otherwise have occasioned.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="327"/>
It might also be said, that the ad∣ditional capital of the nation would enable it to import provisions sufficient for the maintenance of those whom its stock could employ. A small country with a large navy, and great inland accommodations for carriage, such as Holland, may, indeed, import and dis∣tribute an effectual quantity of provi∣sions; but the price of provisions must be very high, to make such an impor∣tation and distribution answer in large countries, less advantageously circum∣stanced in this respect.</P>
<P>An instance, accurately such as I have supposed, may not, perhaps, ever have occurred; but I have little doubt that instances nearly approximating to it may be found without any very laborious search. Indeed I am strongly inclined to think, that England herself, since the
<PB N="312" REF="328"/>
revolution, affords a very striking eluci∣dation of the argument in question.</P>
<P>The commerce of this country, in∣ternal, as well as external, has certainly been rapidly advancing during the last century. The exchangeable value, in the market of Europe, of the annual produce of its land and labour, has, without doubt, increased very consider∣ably. But, upon examination, it will be found, that the increase has been chiefly in the produce of labour, and not in the produce of land; and there∣fore, though the wealth of the nation has been advancing with a quick pace, the effectual funds for the maintenance of labour have been increasing very slowly; and the result is such as might be expected. The increasing wealth of the nation has had little or no ten∣dency to better the condition of the
<PB N="313" REF="329"/>
labouring poor. They have not, I be∣lieve, a greater command of the ne∣cessaries and conveniences of life; and a much greater proportion of them, than at the period of the revolution, is em∣ployed in manufactures, and crowded together in close and unwholesome rooms.</P>
<P>Could we believe the statement of Dr. Price, that the population of Eng∣land has decreased since the revolution, it would even appear, that the effectual funds for the maintenance of labour had been declining during the progress of wealth in other respects. For I con∣ceive that it may be laid down as a general rule, that if the effectual funds for the maintenance of labour are in∣creasing, that is, if the territory can maintain, as well as the stock employ, a greater number of labourers, this ad∣ditional number will quickly spring up,
<PB N="314" REF="330"/>
even in spite of such wars as Dr. Price enumerates. And, consequently, if the population of any country has been sta∣tionary, or declining, we may safely infer, that, however it may have ad∣vanced in manufacturing wealth, its ef∣fectual funds for the maintenance of la∣bour cannot have increased.</P>
<P>It is difficult, however, to conceive that the population of England has been declining since the revolution; though every testimony concurs to prove that its increase, if it has increased, has been very slow. In the controversy which the question has occasioned, Dr. Price undoubtedly appears to be much more completely master of his subject, and to possess more accurate information than his opponents. Judging simply from this controversy, I think one should say, that Dr. Price's point is nearer be∣ing
<PB N="315" REF="331"/>
proved than Mr. Howlett's. Truth, probably, lies between the two statements, but this supposition makes the increase of population, since the revolution, to have been very slow, in comparison with the increase of wealth.</P>
<P>That the produce of the land has been decreasing, or even that it has been ab∣solutely stationary during the last cen∣tury, few will be disposed to believe. The inclosure of commons and waste lands, certainly tends to increase the food of the country; but it has been asserted with confidence, that the inclosure of com∣mon fields, has frequently had a con∣trary effect; and that large tracts of land, which formerly produced great quantities of corn, by being converted into pasture, both employ fewer hands, and feed fewer mouths, than before their inclosure. It is, indeed, an acknowledged
<PB N="316" REF="332"/>
truth, that pasture land produces a smaller quantity of human subsistence, than corn land of the same natural fertility; and could it be clearly ascertained, that from the increased demand for butchers meat of the best quality, and its increased price in consequence, a greater quantity of good land has annually been employed in grazing, the diminution of human sub∣sistence, which this circumstance would occasion, might have counterbalanced the advantages derived from the inclosure of waste lands, and the general improve∣ments in husbandry.</P>
<P>It scarcely need be remarked, that the high price of butchers meat at present, and its low price formerly, were not caused by the scarcity in the one case, or the plenty in the other, but by the different expence sustained at the diffe∣rent periods, in preparing cattle for the
<PB N="317" REF="333"/>
market. It is, however, possible, that there might have been more cattle a hundred years ago in the country, than at present; but no doubt can be enter∣tained, that there is much more meat of a superior quality brought to market at present, than ever there was. When the price of butchers meat was very low, cattle were reared chiefly upon waste lands; and except for some of the prin∣cipal markets, were probably killed with but little other fatting. The veal that is sold so cheap in some distant coun∣ties at present, bears little other resem∣blance than the name, to that which is bought in London. Formerly, the price of butchers meat would not pay for rear∣ing, and scarcely for feeding cattle on land that would answer in tillage; but the present price will not only pay for fatting cattle on the very best land, but will even allow of the rearing many, on
<PB N="318" REF="334"/>
land that would bear good crops of corn. The same number of cattle, or even the same weight of cattle at the different pe∣riods when killed, will have consumed (if I may be allowed the expression) very different quantities of human sub∣sistence. A fatted beast may in some respects be considered, in the language of the French oeconomists, as an unpro∣ductive labourer: he has added nothing to the value of the raw produce that he has consumed. The present system of grazing, undoubtedly tends more than the former system to diminish the quantity of human subsistence in the country, in proportion to the general fertility of the land.</P>
<P>I would not by any means be under∣stood to say, that the former system ei∣ther could, or ought, to have continued. The increasing price of butchers meat,
<PB N="319" REF="335"/>
is a natural and inevitable consequence of the general progress of cultivation; but I cannot help thinking, that the pre∣sent great demand for butchers meat of the best quality, and the quantity of good land that is in consequence annually em∣ployed to produce it, together with the great number of horses at present kept for pleasure, are the chief causes, that have prevented the quantity of human food in the country, from keeping pace with the generally increased fertility of the soil; and a change of custom in these respects, would, I have little doubt, have a very sensible effect on the quan∣tity of subsistence in the country, and consequently on its population.</P>
<P>The employment of much of the most fertile land in grazing, the im∣provements in agricultural instruments, the increase of large farms, and parti∣cularly,
<PB N="320" REF="336"/>
the diminution of the number of cottages throughout the kingdom, all concur to prove, that there are not probably, so many persons employed in agricultural labour now, as at the period of the revolution. Whatever increase of population, therefore, has taken place, must be employed almost wholly in manufactures; and it is well known, that the failure of some of these manu∣factures, merely from the caprice of fashion, such as, the adoption of muslins instead of silks, or of shoe-strings, and covered buttons, instead of buckles and metal buttons, combined with the re∣straints in the market of labour arising from corporation, and parish laws, have frequently driven thousands on charity for support. The great increase of the poors rates, is, indeed, of itself, a strong evidence, that the poor have not a greater command of the necessaries and conve∣niences
<PB N="321" REF="337"/>
of life; and if to the considera∣tion, that their condition in this re∣spect is rather worse than better, be added the circumstance, that a much greater proportion of them is employed in large manufactories, unfavourable both to health and virtue, it must be acknow∣ledged, that the increase of wealth of late years, has had no tendency to in∣crease the happiness of the labouring poor.</P>
<P>That every increase of the stock or revenue of a nation, cannot be con∣sidered as an increase of the real funds for the maintenance of labour, and, therefore, cannot have the same good effect upon the condition of the poor, will appear in a strong light, if the ar∣gument be applied to China.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="338"/>
Dr. Adam Smith observes, that China has probably long been as rich, as the na∣ture of her laws and institutions will admit; but that with other laws and institutions, and if foreign commerce were had in honour, she might still be much richer. The question is, would such an increase of wealth, be an increase of the real funds for the maintenance of la∣bour, and consequently, tend to place the lower classes of people in China in a state of greater plenty?</P>
<P>It is evident, that if trade and foreign commerce were held in great honour in China; from the plenty of labourers, and the cheapness of labour, she might work up manufactures for foreign sale to an immense amount. It is equally evi∣dent, that from the great bulk of provi∣sions, and the amazing extent of her in∣land territory, she could not in return
<PB N="323" REF="339"/>
import such a quantity, as would be any sensible addition to the annual stock of subsistence in the country. Her im∣mense amount of manufactures, therefore, she would exchange, chiefly, for luxuries collected from all parts of the world. At present, it appears, that no labour what∣ever is spared in the production of food. The country is rather over peopled in proportion to what its stock can em∣ploy, and labour is, therefore, so abun∣dant, that no pains are taken to abridge it. The consequence of this, is, probably, the greatest production of food that the soil can possibly afford: for it will be generally observed, that processes for abridging labour, though they may ena∣ble a farmer to bring a certain quan∣tity of grain cheaper to market, tend rather to diminish, than increase the whole produce; and in agriculture, there∣fore, may, in some respects, be considered
<PB N="324" REF="340"/>
rather as private, than public advantages. An immense capital could not be em∣ployed in China in preparing manufac∣tures for foreign trade, without taking off so many labourers from agriculture, as to alter this state of things, and in some degree to diminish the produce of the country. The demand for manufac∣turing labourers would naturally raise the price of labour; but as the quantity of subsistence would not be increased, the price of provisions would keep pace with it; or even more than keep pace with it, if the quantity of provisions were really decreasing. The country would be evidently advancing in wealth: the exchangeable value of the annual pro∣duce of its land and labour, would be an∣nually augmented; yet the real funds for the maintenance of labour, would be stationary, or even declining; and, consequently, the increasing wealth of
<PB N="325" REF="341"/>
the nation would rather tend to depress, than to raise, the condition of the poor. With regard to the command over the necessaries and comforts of life, they would be in the same or rather worse state than before; and a great part of them would have exchanged the healthy labours of agriculture, for the unhealthy occupations of manufacturing industry.</P>
<P>The argument, perhaps, appears clearer when applied to China, because it is ge∣nerally allowed, that the wealth of China has been long stationary. With regard to any other country it might be always a matter of dispute, at which of the two periods, compared, wealth was increasing the fastest; as it is upon the rapidity of the increase of wealth at any particular period, that Dr. Adam Smith says the condition of the poor depends. It is evi∣dent, however, that two nations might
<PB N="326" REF="342"/>
increase, exactly with the same rapi∣dity, in the exchangeable value of the annual produce of their land and la∣bour; yet if one had applied itself chiefly to agriculture, and the other chiefly to commerce, the funds for the maintenance of labour, and consequently the effect of the increase of wealth in each nation, would be extremely different. In that which had applied itself chiefly to agri∣culture, the poor would live in great plenty, and population would rapidly in∣crease. In that which had applied itself chiefly to commerce, the poor would be comparatively but little benefited, and consequently population would increase slowly.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Question of the proper definition of the wealth of a state.—Reason given by the French Oeconomists for consider∣ing all manufacturers as unproductive labourers, not the true reason.—The labour of artificers and manu∣facturers sufficiently productive to individuals, though not to the state.—A remarkable passage in Dr. Prices's two volumes of observations.—Error of Dr. Price in attributing the happiness and rapid population of Ame∣rica, chiefly, to its peculiar state of civilization.—No advantage can be expected from shutting our eyes to the difficulties in the way to the improvement of society.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A QUESTION seems naturally to arise here, whether the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and la∣bour, be the proper definition of the wealth of a country; or, whether the gross produce of the land, according to the French oeconomists, may not be a more accurate definition. Certain it is, that every increase of wealth, according to the definition of the Oeconomists, will
<PB N="328" REF="344"/>
be an increase of the funds for the main∣tenance of labour, and consequently will always tend to ameliorate the condition of the labouring poor; though an in∣crease of wealth, according to Dr. Adam Smith's definition, will by no means in∣variably have the same tendency. And yet it may not follow from this con∣sideration, that Dr. Adam Smith's de∣finition is not just. It seems in many respects improper, to exclude the cloath∣ing and lodging of a whole people from any part of their revenue. Much of it may, indeed, be of very trivial and unimportant value, in comparison with the food of the country; yet still it may be fairly considered as a part of its re∣venue: and, therefore, the only point in which I should differ from Dr. Adam Smith, is, where he seems to consider every increase of the revenue or stock of a society, as an increase of the funds
<PB N="329" REF="345"/>
for the maintenance of labour, and con∣sequently, as tending always to ameliorate the condition of the poor.</P>
<P>The fine silks and cottons, the laces, and other ornamental luxuries, of a rich country, may contribute very consider∣ably to augment the exchangeable value of its annual produce; yet they con∣tribute but in a very small degree, to augment the mass of happiness in the society: and it appears to me, that it is with some view to the real utility of the produce, that we ought to esti∣mate the productiveness, or unproduc∣tiveness of different sorts of labour. The French Oeconomists consider all labour employed in manufactures as unproduc∣tive. Comparing it with the labour em∣ployed upon land, I should be perfectly disposed to agree with them; but not ex∣actly for the reasons which they give.
<PB N="330" REF="346"/>
They say, that labour employed upon land is productive, because the produce, over and above completely paying the labourer and the farmer, affords a clear rent to the landlord; and that the labour employed upon a piece of lace is unpro∣ductive, because it merely replaces the provisions that the workman had con∣sumed, and the stock of his employer, without affording any clear rent what∣ever. But supposing the value of the wrought lace to be such, as that be∣sides paying in the most complete man∣ner the workman and his employer, it could afford a clear rent to a third person; it appears to me, that in com∣parison with the labour employed upon land, it would be still as unproductive as ever. Though according to the rea∣soning used by the French Oeconomists, the man employed in the manufacture of lace would, in this case, seem to be a pro∣ductive
<PB N="331" REF="347"/>
labourer; yet according to their definition of the wealth of a state, he ought not to be considered in that light. He will have added nothing to the gross produce of the land: he has consumed a portion of this gross produce, and has left a bit of lace in return; and though he may sell this bit of lace for three times the quantity of provisions that he con∣sumed whilst he was making it, and thus be a very productive labourer with regard to himself; yet he cannot be considered as having added by his labour to any essential part of the riches of the state. The clear rent, therefore, that a certain produce can afford, after paying the expences of procuring it, does not ap∣pear to be the sole criterion, by which to judge of the productiveness or un∣productiveness to a state, of any parti∣cular species of labour.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="348"/>
Suppose, that two hundred thousand men, who are now employed in producing manufactures, that only tend to gratify the vanity of a few rich people, were to be employed upon some barren and un∣cultivated lands, and to produce only half the quantity of food that they themselves consumed; they would be still, more productive labourers with regard to the state, than they were before; though their labour, so far from affording a rent to a third person, would but half replace the provisions used in obtain∣ing the produce. In their former employ∣ment, they consumed a certain portion of the food of the country, and left in return, some silks and laces. In their latter employment, they consumed the same quantity of food, and left in re∣turn, provision for a hundred thousand men. There can be little doubt, which of the two legacies would be the most
<PB N="333" REF="349"/>
really beneficial to the country; and it will, I think, be allowed, that the wealth which supported the two hundred thou∣sand men, while they were producing silks and laces, would have been more usefully employed in supporting them, while they were producing the additional quantity of food.</P>
<P>A capital employed upon land, may be unproductive to the individual that employs it, and yet be highly produc∣tive to the society. A capital employed in trade on the contrary, may be highly productive to the individual, and yet be almost totally unproductive to the so∣ciety: and this is the reason why I should call manufacturing labour unpro∣ductive, in comparison of that which is employed in agriculture, and not for the reason given by the French Oeconomists. It is, indeed, almost impossible, to see
<PB N="334" REF="350"/>
the great fortunes that are made in trade, and the liberality with which so many merchants live, and yet agree in the statement or the Oeconomists, that ma∣nufacturers can only grow rich by de∣priving themselves of the funds des∣tined for their support. In many branches of trade the profits are so great, as would allow of a clear rent to a third person: but as there is no third person in the case, and as all the profits centre in the master manufacturer, or merchant, he seems to have a fair chance of grow∣ing rich, without much privation; and we consequently see large fortunes ac∣quired in trade by persons who have not been remarked for their parsimony.</P>
<P>Daily experience proves, that the labour employed in trade and manufactures, is sufficiently productive to individuals; but it certainly is not productive in the same
<PB N="335" REF="351"/>
degree to the state. Every accession to the food of a country, tends to the im∣mediate benefit of the whole society; but the fortunes made in trade, tend, but in a remote and uncertain manner, to the same end, and in some respects have even a contrary tendency. The home trade of consumption, is by far the most important trade of every nation. China is the richest country in the world, with∣out any other. Putting then, for a mo∣ment, foreign trade out of the question, the man, who by an ingenious manufac∣ture, obtains a double portion out of the old stock of provisions, will certainly not be so useful to the state, as the man who, by his labour, adds a single share to the former stock. The consumable commo∣dities of silks, laces, trinkets, and ex∣pensive furniture, are undoubtedly a part of the revenue of the society; but they are the revenue only of the rich, and
<PB N="336" REF="352"/>
not of the society in general. An in∣crease in this part of the revenue of a state, cannot, therefore, be considered of the same importance, as an increase of food, which forms the principal re∣venue of the great mass of the people.</P>
<P>Foreign commerce adds to the wealth of a state, according to Dr. Adam Smith's definition, though not according to the definition of the oeconomists. Its princi∣pal use, and the reason, probably, that it has in general been held in such high estimation, is, that it adds greatly to the external power of a nation, or to its power of commanding the labour of other countries; but it will be found, upon a near examination, to contribute but little to the increase of the internal funds for the maintenance of labour, and conse∣quently but little to the happiness of the greatest part of society. In the natural
<PB N="337" REF="353"/>
progress of a state towards riches, manu∣factures, and foreign commerce; would follow, in their order, the high cultiva∣tion of the soil. In Europe, this natural order of things has been inverted; and the soil has been cultivated from the redun∣dancy of manufacturing capital, instead of manufactures rising from the redun∣dancy of capital employed upon land. The superior encouragement that has been given to the industry of the towns, and the consequent higher price that is paid for the labour of artificers, than for the labour of those employed in husbandry, are probably the reasons why so much soil in Europe remains uncultivated. Had a different policy been pursued through∣out Europe, it might undoubtedly have been much more populous than at pre∣sent, and yet not be more incumbered by its population.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="354"/>
I cannot quit this curious subject of the difficulty arising from population, a subject, that appears to me, to deserve a minute investigation, and able discussion, much beyond my power to give it, with∣out taking notice of an extraordinary passage in Dr. Price's two volumes of Ob∣servations. Having given some tables on the probabilities of life, in towns and in the country, he says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 2. page 243.</NOTE> <Q>From this com∣parison, it appears, with how much truth great cities have been called the graves of mankind. It must also convince all who will consider it, that according to the ob∣servation, at the end of the fourth essay, in the former volume, it is by no means strictly proper to consider our diseases as the original intention of nature. They are, without doubt, in general our own creation. <HI>Were there a country where the</HI><PB N="339" REF="355"/><HI>inhabitants led lives entirely natural and virtuous, few of them would die without measuring out the whole period of present existence allotted to them; pain and distem∣per would be unknown among them, and death would come upon them like a sleep, in consequence of no other cause than gra∣dual and unavoidable decay.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I own, that I felt myself obliged to draw a very opposite conclusion from the facts advanced in Dr. Price's two volumes. I had for some time been aware, that population and food, increased in dif∣ferent ratios; and a vague opinion had been floating in my mind, that they could only be kept equal by some species of misery or vice; but the perusal of Dr. Price's two volumes of Observations, after that opinion had been conceived, raised it at once to conviction. With so many facts in his view, to prove the
<PB N="340" REF="356"/>
extraordinary rapidity with which po∣pulation increases, when unchecked; and with such a body of evidence before him, to elucidate, even the manner, by which the general laws of nature repress a re∣dundant population; it is perfectly in∣conceivable to me, how he could write the passage that I have quoted. He was a strenuous advocate for early marriages, as the best preservative against vicious manners. He had no fanciful concep∣tions about the extinction of the passion between the sexes, like Mr. Godwin, nor did he ever think of eluding the dif∣ficulty in the ways hinted at by Mr. Condorcet. He frequently talks of giving the prolifick powers of nature room to exert themselves. Yet with these ideas, that his understanding could escape from the obvious and necessary inference, that an unchecked population would increase, beyond comparison, faster than the earth,
<PB N="341" REF="357"/>
by the best directed exertions of man, could produce food for its support, ap∣pears to me as astonishing, as if he had resisted the conclusion of one of the plainest propositions of Euclid.</P>
<P>Dr. Price, speaking of the different stages of the civilized state, says, <Q>The first, or simple stages of civilization, are those which favour most the increase and the happiness of mankind.</Q> He then instances the American colonies, as be∣ing at that time in the first, and happiest of the states, that he had described; and as affording a very striking proof of the effects of the different stages of civiliza∣tion on population. But he does not seem to be aware, that the happiness of the Americans, depended much less upon their peculiar degree of civilization, than upon the peculiarity of their situation, as new colonies, upon their having a
<PB N="342" REF="358"/>
great plenty of fertile uncultivated land. In parts of Norway, Denmark, or Swe∣den, or in this country, two or three hun∣dred years ago, he might have found per∣haps nearly the same degree of civilization; but by no means the same happiness, or the same increase of population. He quotes himself a statute of Henry the Eighth, complaining of the decay of til∣lage, and the enhanced price of provi∣sions, <Q>whereby a marvellous number of people were rendered incapable of main∣taining themselves and families.</Q> The su∣perior degree of civil liberty which prevail∣ed in America, contributed, without doubt, its share, to promote the industry, hap∣piness, and population of these states: but even civil liberty, all powerful as it is, will not create fresh land. The Ame∣ricans may be said, perhaps, to enjoy a greater degree of civil liberty, now they are an independent people, than while
<PB N="343" REF="359"/>
they were in subjection to England; but we may be perfectly sure, that popula∣tion will not long continue to increase with the same rapidity as it did then.</P>
<P>A person who contemplated the hap∣py state of the lower classes of people in America twenty years ago, would naturally wish to retain them for ever in that state; and might think, per∣haps, that by preventing the introduc∣tion of manufactures and luxury, he might effect his purpose: but he might as reasonably expect to prevent a wife or mistress from growing old by never exposing her to the sun or air. The situation of new colonies, well governed, is a bloom of youth that no efforts can arrest. There are, indeed, many modes of treatment in the political, as well as animal body, that contribute to accele∣rate or retard the approaches of age:
<PB N="344" REF="360"/>
but there can be no chance of success, in any mode that could be devised, for keeping either of them in perpetual youth. By encouraging the industry of the towns more than the industry of the country, Europe may be said, per∣haps, to have brought on a premature old age. A different policy in this respect, would infuse fresh life and vigour into every state. While from the law of primogeni∣ture, and other European customs, land bears a monopoly price, a capital can never be employed in it with much advantage to the individual; and, there∣fore, it is not probable that the soil should be properly cultivated. And, though in every civilized state, a class of proprietors and a class of labourers must exist; yet one permanent advantage would always result from a nearer equali∣zation of property. The greater the number of proprietors, the smaller must
<PB N="345" REF="361"/>
be the number of labourers: a greater part of society would be in the happy state of possessing property; and a smaller part in the unhappy state of possessing no other property than their labour. But the best directed exertions, though they may alleviate, can never remove the pressure of want; and it will be difficult for any person who contem∣plates the genuine situation of man on earth, and the general laws of nature, to suppose it possible that any, the most enlightened efforts, could place man∣kind in a state where <Q>few would die without measuring out the whole pe∣riod of present existence allotted to them; where pain and distemper would be un∣known among them; and death would come upon them like a sleep, in con∣sequence of no other cause than gra∣dual and unavoidable decay.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="362"/>
It is, undoubtedly, a most dishearten∣ing reflection, that the great obstacle in the way to any extraordinary im∣provement in society, is of a nature that we can never hope to overcome. The perpetual tendency in the race of man to increase beyond the means of subsistence, is one of the general laws of animated nature, which we can have no reason to expect will change. Yet, dis∣couraging as the contemplation of this difficulty must be, to those whose ex∣ertions are laudably directed to the im∣provement of the human species, it is evident, that no possible good can arise from any endeavours to slur it over, or keep it in the back ground. On the contrary, the most baleful mischiefs may be expected from the unmanly conduct of not daring to face truth, because it is unpleasing. Independently of what relates to this great obstacle,
<PB N="347" REF="363"/>
sufficient yet remains to be done for mankind, to animate us to the most un∣remitted exertion. But if we proceed without a thorough knowledge, and ac∣curate comprehension of the nature, ex∣tent, and magnitude, of the difficulties we have to encounter, or if we un∣wisely direct our efforts towards an ob∣ject, in which we cannot hope for suc∣cess; we shall not only exhaust our strength in fruitless exertions, and re∣main at as great a distance as ever from the summit of our wishes; but we shall be perpetually crushed by the recoil of this rock of Sisyphus.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The constant pressure of distress on man, from the principle of population, seems to direct our hopes to the future.—State of trial inconsistent with our ideas of the fore∣knowledge of God.—The world, probably, a mighty process for awakening matter into mind.—Theory of the formation of mind.—Excitements from the wants of the body.—Excitements from the operation of general laws. Excitements from the difficulties of life arising from the principle of population.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE view of human life, which re∣sults from the contemplation of the constant pressure of distress on man from the difficulty of subsistence, by shewing the little expectation that he can reasonably entertain of perfectibility on earth, seems strongly to point his hopes to the future. And the tempta∣tions to which he must necessarily be exposed, from the operation of those laws of nature which we have been ex∣amining,
<PB N="349" REF="365"/>
would seem to represent the world, in the light in which it has been frequently considered, as a state of trial, and school of virtue, preparatory to a superior state of happiness. But I hope I shall be pardoned, if I attempt to give a view in some degree different of the situation of man on earth, which appears to me, to be more con∣sistent with the various phenomena of nature which we observe around us, and more consonant to our ideas of the power, goodness, and foreknowledge of the Deity.</P>
<P>It cannot be considered as an unim∣proving exercise of the human mind to endeavour to</P>
<Q>Vindicate the ways of God to man.</Q>
<P>If we proceed with a proper distrust of our own understandings, and a just
<PB N="350" REF="366"/>
sense of our insufficiency to comprehend the reason of all that we see; if we hail every ray of light with gratitude; and when no light appears, think that the darkness is from within, and not from without; and bow with humble defe∣rence to the supreme wisdom of him, whose <Q>thoughts are above our thoughts,</Q> <Q>as the heavens are high above the earth.</Q></P>
<P>In all our feeble attempts, however, to <Q>find out the Almighty to perfec∣tion,</Q> it seems absolutely necessary, that we should reason from nature up to nature's God, and not presume to rea∣son from God to nature. The moment we allow ourselves to ask why some things are not otherwise, instead of en∣deavouring to account for them, as they are, we shall never know where to stop; we shall be led into the
<PB N="351" REF="367"/>
grossest, and most childish absurdities; all progress in the knowledge of the ways of Providence must necessarily be at an end; and the study will even cease to be an improving exercise of the hu∣man mind. Infinite power is so vast and incomprehensible an idea, that the mind of man must necessarily be be∣wildered in the contemplation of it. With the crude and puerile conceptions which we sometimes form of this at∣tribute of the Deity, we might imagine that God could call into being myriads, and myriads of existences; all free from pain and imperfection; all eminent in goodness and wisdom; all capable of the highest enjoyments; and unnumbered as the points throughout infinite space. But when from these vain and extra∣vagant dreams of fancy, we turn our eyes to the book of nature, where alone we can read God as he is, we see a con∣stant
<PB N="352" REF="368"/>
succession of sentient beings, rising apparently from so many specks of mat∣ter, going through a long and some∣times painful process in this world; but many of them attaining, ere the ter∣mination of it, such high qualities and powers, as seem to indicate their fitness for some superior state. Ought we not then to correct our crude and puerile ideas of Infinite Power from the contem∣plation of what we actually see existing? Can we judge of the Creator but from his creation? And, unless we wish to exalt the power of God at the expence of his goodness, ought we not to con∣clude, that even to the Great Creator, Almighty as he is, a certain process may be necessary, a certain time, (or at least what appears to us as time) may be requisite, in order to form beings with those exalted qualities of mind which will fit them for his high purposes?</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="369"/>
A state of trial seems to imply a previously formed existence, that does not agree with the appearance of man in infancy, and indicates something like suspicion and want of foreknowledge, inconsistent with those ideas which we wish to cherish of the Supreme Being. I should be inclined, therefore, as I have hinted before in a note, to con∣sider the world, and this life, as the mighty process of God, not for the trial, but for the creation and formation of mind; a processs necessary, to awaken inert, chaotic matter, into spirit; to sub∣limate the dust of the earth into soul; to elicit an aethereal spark from the clod of clay. And in this view of the subject, the various impressions and ex∣citements which man receives through life, may be considered as the forming hand of his Creator, acting by general laws, and awakening his sluggish ex∣istence,
<PB N="354" REF="370"/>
by the animating touches of the Divinity, into a capacity of superior enjoyment. The original sin of man, is the torpor and corruption of the chaotic matter, in which he may be said to be born.</P>
<P>It could answer no good purpose to enter into the question, whether mind be a distinct substance from matter, or only a finer form of it. The question is, perhaps, after all, a question merely of words. Mind is as essentially mind, whether formed from matter, or any other substance. We know, from ex∣perience, that soul and body are most intimately united; and every appearance seems to indicate, that they grow from infancy together. It would be a sup∣position attended with very little proba∣bility, to believe that a complete and full formed spirit existed in every infant;
<PB N="355" REF="371"/>
but that it was clogged and impeded in its operations, during the first twenty years of life, by the weakness, or hebe∣tude, of the organs in which it was en∣closed. As we shall all be disposed to agree, that God is the creator of mind as well as of body; and as they both seem to be forming and unfolding themselves at the same time; it cannot appear in∣consistent either with reason or revela∣tion, if it appear to be consistent with the phenomena of nature, to suppose that God is constantly occupied in form∣ing mind out of matter, and that the various impressions that man receives through life, is the process for that pur∣pose. The employment is surely worthy of the highest attributes of the Deity.</P>
<P>This view of the state of man on earth will not seem to be unattended with probability, if, judging from the little
<PB N="356" REF="372"/>
experience we have of the nature of mind, it shall appear, upon investigation, that the phenomena around us, and the various events of human life, seem pecu∣liarly calculated to promote this great end: and especially, if, upon this sup∣position, we can account, even to our own narrow understandings, for many of those roughnesses and inequalities in life, which querulous man too frequently makes the subject of his complaint against the God of nature.</P>
<P>The first great awakeners of the mind seem to be the wants of the body <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was my intention to have entered at some length into this subject, as a kind of second part to the essay. A long interruption, from particular busi∣ness, has obliged me to lay aside this intention, at least for the present. I shall now, therefore, only give a sketch of a few of the leading circumstances that appear to me to favour the general supposition that I have advanced.</NOTE>.
<PB N="357" REF="373"/>
They are the first stimulants that rouse the brain of infant man into sentient activity: and such seems to be the slug∣gishness of original matter, that unless, by a peculiar course of excitements, other wants, equally powerful, are generated, these stimulants seem, even afterwards, to be necessary, to continue that activity which they first awakened. The savage would slumber for ever under his tree, unless he were roused from his torpor by the cravings of hunger, or the pinchings of cold; and the exertions that he makes to avoid these evils, by procuring food, and building himself a covering, are the exercises which form and keep in mo∣tion his faculties, which otherwise would sink into listless inactivity. From all that experience has taught us concerning the structure of the human mind, if those stimulants to exertion, which arise from the wants of the body, were removed
<PB N="358" REF="374"/>
from the mass of mankind, we have much more reason to think, that they would be sunk to the level of brutes, from a deficiency of excitements, than that they would be raised to the rank of phi∣losophers by the possession of leisure. In those countries, where nature is the most redundant in spontaneous produce, the inhabitants will not be found the most remarkable for acuteness of intellect. Necessity has been with great truth called the mother of invention. Some of the noblest exertions of the human mind have been set in motion by the necessity of satisfying the wants of the body. Want has not unfrequently given wings to the imagination of the poet; pointed the flowing periods of the historian; and added acuteness to the researches of the philosopher: and though there are un∣doubtedly many minds at present, so far improved by the various excitements of
<PB N="359" REF="375"/>
knowledge, or of social sympathy, that they would not relapse into listlesness, if their bodily stimulants were removed; yet, it can scarcely be doubted, that these stimulants could not be withdrawn from the mass of mankind, without pro∣ducing a general and fatal torpor, de∣structive of all the germs of future im∣provement.</P>
<P>Locke, if I recollect, says, that the endeavour to avoid pain, rather than the pursuit of pleasure, is the great stimulus to action in life: and that in looking to any particular pleasure, we shall not be roused into action in order to obtain it, till the contemplation of it has continued so long, as to amount to a sensation of pain or uneasiness under the absence of it. To avoid evil, and to pursue good, seem to be the great duty and business of man; and this world appears to be
<PB N="360" REF="376"/>
peculiarly calculated to afford opportu∣nity of the most unremitted exertion of this kind: and it is by this exertion, by these stimulants, that mind is formed. If Locke's idea be just, and there is great reason to think that it is, evil seems to be necessary to create exertion; and ex∣ertion seems evidently necessary to create mind.</P>
<P>The necessity of food for the support of life, gives rise, probably, to a greater quantity of exertion, than any other want, bodily or mental. The supreme Being has ordained, that the earth shall not produce food in great quantities, till much preparatory labour and inge∣nuity has been exercised upon its surface. There is no conceivable connection to our comprehensions, between the seed, and the plant, or tree, that rises from it. The Supreme Creator might, undoubtedly,
<PB N="361" REF="377"/>
raise up plants of all kinds, for the use of his creatures, without the assistance of those little bits of matter, which we call seed, or even without the assisting la∣bour and attention of man. The processes of ploughing and clearing the ground, of collecting and sowing seeds, are not surely for the assistance of God in his creation; but are made previously neces∣sary to the enjoyment of the blessings of life, in order to rouse man into action, and form his mind to reason.</P>
<P>To furnish the most unremitted excite∣ments of this kind, and to urge man to further the gracious designs of Providence, by the full cultivation of the earth, it has been ordained, that population should in∣crease much faster than food. This ge∣neral law, (as it has appeared in the for∣mer parts of this essay) undoubtedly pro∣duces much partial evil; but a little re∣flection
<PB N="362" REF="378"/>
may, perhaps, satisfy us, that it produces a great overbalance of good. Strong excitements seem necessary to create exertion; and to direct this exer∣tion, and form the reasoning faculty, it seems absolutely necessary, that the Su∣preme Being should act always according to general laws. The constancy of the laws of nature, or the certainty, with which we may expect the same effect, from the same causes, is the foundation of the faculty of reason. If in the or∣dinary course of things, the finger of God were frequently visible; or to speak more correctly, if God were frequently to change his purpose, (for the finger of God is, indeed, visible in every blade of grass that we see) a general and fatal torpor of the human faculties would pro∣bably ensue; even the bodily wants of mankind would cease to stimulate them to exertion, could they not reasonably
<PB N="363" REF="379"/>
expect, that if their efforts were well directed, they would be crowned with success. The constancy of the laws of nature, is the foundation of the industry and foresight of the husbandman; the indefatigable ingenuity of the artificer; the skilful researches of the physician, and anatomist; and the watchful obser∣vation, and patient investigation, of the natural philosopher. To this constancy, we owe all the greatest, and noblest ef∣forts of intellect. To this constancy, we owe the immortal mind of a Newton.</P>
<P>As the reasons, therefore, for the con∣stancy of the laws of nature, seem, even to our understandings, obvious and strik∣ing; if we return to the principle of po∣pulation, and consider man as he really is, inert, sluggish, and averse from la∣bour, unless compelled by necessity, (and it is surely the height of folly to talk of
<PB N="364" REF="380"/>
man, according to our crude fancies, of what he might be) we may pronounce, with certainty, that the world would not have been peopled, but for the su∣periority of the power of population to the means of subsistence. Strong, and constantly operative as this stimulus is on man, to urge him to the cultivation of the earth; if we still see that cultivation proceeds very slowly, we may fairly con∣clude, that a less stimulus would have been insufficient. Even under the ope∣ration of this constant excitement, savages will inhabit countries of the greatest na∣tural fertility, for a long period, before they betake themselves to pasturage or agriculture. Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is proba∣ble that man might never have emerged from the savage state. But supposing the earth once well peopled, an Alexander, a Julius Caesar, a Tamerlane, or a bloody revolution, might irrecoverably thin the
<PB N="365" REF="381"/>
human race, and defeat the great designs of the Creator. The ravages of a con∣tagious disorder would be felt for ages; and an earthquake might unpeople a region for ever. The principle, accord∣ing to which population increases, pre∣vents the vices of mankind, or the ac∣cidents of nature, the partial evils arising from general laws, from obstructing the high purpose of the creation. It keeps the inhabitants of the earth always fully up to the level of the means of sub∣sistence; and is constantly acting upon man as a powerful stimulus, urging him to the further cultivation of the earth, and to enable it, consequently, to sup∣port a more extended population. But it is impossible that this law can ope∣rate, and produce the effects apparently intended by the Supreme Being, without occasioning partial evil. Unless the prin∣ciple of population were to be altered,
<PB N="366" REF="382"/>
according to the circumstances of each separate country, (which would not only be contrary to our universal experience, with regard to the laws of nature, but would contradict even our own reason, which sees the absolute necessity of ge∣neral laws, for the formation of intellect;) it is evident, that the same principle, which, seconded by industry, will peo∣ple a fertile region in a few years, must produce distress in countries that have been long inhabited.</P>
<P>It seems, however, every way proba∣ble, that even the acknowledged diffi∣culties occasioned by the law of popula∣tion, tend rather to promote, than im∣pede the general purpose of Providence. They excite universal exertion, and con∣tribute to that infinite variety of situa∣tions, and consequently of impressions, which seems, upon the whole, favoura∣ble
<PB N="367" REF="383"/>
to the growth of mind. It is proba∣ble, that too great, or too little excite∣ment, extreme poverty, or too great riches, may be alike unfavourable in this respect. The middle regions of society seem to be best suited to intellectual im∣provement; but it is contrary to the analogy of all nature, to expect that the whole of society can be a middle region. The temperate zones of the earth, seem to be the most favourable to the mental, and corporeal energies of man; but all cannot be temperate zones. A world, warmed and enlightened but by one sun, must, from the laws of matter, have some parts chilled by perpetual frosts, and others scorched by perpetual heats. Every piece of matter lying on a surface, must have an upper, and an under side: all the particles cannot be in the middle. The most valuable parts of an oak, to a timber merchant, are not either the roots,
<PB N="368" REF="384"/>
or the branches; but these are absolutely necessary to the existence of the middle part, or stem, which is the object in re∣quest. The timber merchant could not possibly expect to make an oak grow without roots or branches; but if he could find out a mode of cultivation, which would cause more of the substance to go to stem, and less to root and branch, he would be right to exert him∣self in bringing such a system into gene∣ral use.</P>
<P>In the same manner, though we can∣not possibly expect to exclude riches, and poverty, from society; yet if we could find out a mode of government, by which, the numbers in the extreme re∣gions would be lessened, and the num∣bers in the middle regions increased, it would be undoubtedly our duty to adopt it. It is not, however, improbable, that
<PB N="369" REF="385"/>
as in the oak, the roots and branches could not be diminished very greatly, without weakening the vigorous circula∣tion of the sap in the stem; so in so∣ciety, the extreme parts could not be diminished beyond a certain degree, without lessening that animated exertion throughout the middle parts, which is the very cause, that they are the most favourable to the growth of intellect. If no man could hope to rise, or fear to fall, in society; if industry did not bring with it its reward, and idleness its punish∣ment, the middle parts would not cer∣tainly be what they now are. In reason∣ing upon this subject, it is evident, that we ought to consider chiefly the mass of mankind, and not individual instances. There are undoubtedly many minds, and there ought to be many, according to the chances, out of so great a mass, that, having been vivified early, by a peculiar
<PB N="370" REF="386"/>
course of excitements, would not need the constant action of narrow motives, to continue them in activity. But if we were to review the various useful disco∣veries, the valuable writings, and other laudable exertions of mankind; I believe we should find, that more were to be attributed to the narrow motives that operate upon the many, than to the ap∣parently more enlarged motives that ope∣rate upon the few.</P>
<P>Leisure is, without doubt, highly va∣luable to man; but taking man, as he is, the probability seems to be, that in the greater number of instances, it will produce evil rather than good. It has been not unfrequently remarked, that talents are more common among younger brothers, than among elder brothers; but it can scarcely be imagined, that younger brothers are, upon an average, born with
<PB N="371" REF="387"/>
a greater original susceptibility of parts. The difference, if there really is any ob∣servable difference, can only arise from their different situations. Exertion and activity, are in general absolutely neces∣sary in the one case, and are only op∣tional in the other.</P>
<P>That the difficulties of life, contribute to generate talents, every days experience must convince us. The exertions that men find it necessary to make, in order to support themselves or families, fre∣quently awaken faculties, that might otherwise have lain for ever dormant: and it has been commonly remarked, that new and extraordinary situations ge∣nerally create minds adequate to grapple with the difficulties in which they are involved.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The sorrows of life necessary to soften and humanize the heart.—The excitements of social sympathy often produce characters of a higher order than the mere possessors of talents.—Moral evil probably necessary to the production of moral excellence.—Excitements from intellectual wants continually kept up by the infinite va∣riety of nature, and the obscurity that involves meta∣physical subjects.—The difficulties in Revelation to be accounted for upon this principle.—The degree of evi∣dence which the scriptures contain, probably, best suited to the improvement of the human faculties, and the mo∣ral amelioration of mankind.—The idea that mind is created by excitements, seems to account for the existence of natural and moral evil.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE sorrows and distresses of life form another class of excitements, which seem to be necessary, by a peculiar train of impressions, to soften and humanize the heart, to awaken social sympathy, to generate all the Christian virtues, and to afford scope for the ample exertion of benevolence. The general tendency
<PB N="373" REF="389"/>
of an uniform course of prosperity is, rather to degrade, than exalt the cha∣racter. The heart that has never known sorrow itself, will seldom be feelingly alive, to the pains and pleasures, the wants and wishes, of its fellow beings. It will seldom be overflowing with that warmth of brotherly love, those kind and amiable affections, which dignify the human character, even more than the possession of the highest talents. Ta∣lents, indeed, though undoubtedly a very prominent and fine feature of mind, can by no means be considered as constituting the whole of it. There are many minds which have not been exposed to those ex∣citements, that usually form talents, that have yet been vivified to a high degree, by the excitements of social sympathy. In every rank of life, in the lowest, as frequently as in the highest, characters are to be found, overflowing with the
<PB N="374" REF="390"/>
milk of human kindness, breathing love to∣wards God and man; and though with∣out those peculiar powers of mind called talents, evidently holding a higher rank in the scale of beings, than many who possess them. Evangelical charity, meek∣ness, piety, and all that class of virtues, distinguished particularly by the name of Christian virtues, do not seem necessa∣rily to include abilities; yet a soul pos∣sessed of these amiable qualities, a soul awakened and vivified by these delight∣ful sympathies, seems to hold a nearer commerce with the skies, than mere acuteness of intellect.</P>
<P>The greatest talents have been fre∣quently misapplied, and have produced evil proportionate to the extent of their powers. Both reason and revelation seem to assure us, that such minds will be con∣demned to eternal death; but while on
<PB N="375" REF="391"/>
earth, these vicious instruments performed their part in the great mass of impres∣sions, by the disgust and abhorrence which they excited. It seems highly probable, that moral evil is absolutely necessary to the production of moral excellence. A being with only good placed in view, may be justly said to be impelled by a blind necessity. The pursuit of good in this case, can be no indication of virtuous propensities. It might be said, perhaps, that Infinite Wisdom, cannot want such an indication as outward action, but would foreknow, with certainty, whe∣ther the being would chuse good or evil. This might be a plausible argu∣ment against a state of trial; but will not hold against the supposition, that mind in this world is in a state of form∣ation. Upon this idea, the being that has seen moral evil, and has felt disappro∣bation and disgust at it, is essentially
<PB N="376" REF="392"/>
different from the being that has seen only good. They are pieces of clay that have received distinct impressions: they must, therefore, necessarily be in different shapes; or, even if we allow them both to have the same lovely form of virtue, it must be acknowledged, that one has under∣gone the further process, necessary to give firmness and durability to its sub∣stance; while the other is still exposed to injury, and liable to be broken by every accidental impulse. An ardent love and admiration of virtue seems to imply the existence of something oppo∣site to it; and it seems highly probable, that the same beauty of form and sub∣stance, the same perfection of character, could not be generated, without the impressions of disapprobation which arise from the spectacle of moral evil.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="393"/>
When the mind has been awakened into activity by the passions, and the wants of the body, intellectual wants arise; and the desire of knowledge, and the impatience under ignorance, form a new and important class of excitements. Every part of nature seems peculiarly cal∣culated to furnish stimulants to mental exertion of this kind, and to offer inex∣haustible food for the most unremitted inquiry. Our immortal Bard says of Cleopatra—</P>
<Q><L>—Custom cannot stale</L>
<L>Her infinite variety.</L></Q>
<P>The expression, when applied to any one object, may be considered as a poetical amplification, but it is accurately true when applied to nature. Infinite variety, seems, indeed, eminently her character∣istic feature. The shades that are here and there blended in the picture, give
<PB N="378" REF="394"/>
spirit, life, and prominence to her exu∣berant beauties; and those roughnesses and inequalities, those inferior parts that support the superior, though they some∣times offend the fastidious miscroscopic eye of short sighted man, contribute to the symmetry, grace, and fair proportion of the whole.</P>
<P>The infinite variety of the forms and operations of nature, besides tending im∣mediately to awaken and improve the mind by the variety of impressions that it creates, opens other fertile sources of improvement, by offering so wide and extensive a field for investigation and research. Uniform, undiversified perfec∣tion, could not possess the same awaken∣ing powers. When we endeavour then to contemplate the system of the universe; when we think of the stars as the suns of other systems, scattered throughout infinite space; when we reflect, that we
<PB N="379" REF="395"/>
do not probably see a millionth part of those bright orbs, that are beaming light and life to unnumbered worlds; when our minds, unable to grasp the im∣measurable conception, sink, lost and con∣founded, in admiration at the mighty in∣comprehensible power of the Creator; let us not querulously complain that all climates are not equally genial; that perpe∣tual spring does not reign throughout the year; that all God's creatures do not possess the same advantages; that clouds and tem∣pests sometimes darken the natural world, and vice and misery, the moral world; and that all the works of the creation are not formed with equal perfection. Both reason and experience seem to indicate to us, that the infinite variety of nature, (and variety cannot exist without inferior parts, or apparent blemishes) is admira∣bly adapted to further the high pur∣pose of the creation, and to produce the greatest possible quantity of good.</P>

The obscurity that involves all meta∣physical subjects, appears to me, in the same manner peculiarly calculated, to add to that class of excitements which arise from the thirst of knowledge. It is probable that man, while on earth, will never be able to attain complete satisfaction on these subjects; but this is by no means a reason that he should not engage in them. The darkness that surrounds these interesting topics of hu∣man curiosity, may be intended to fur∣nish endless motives to intellectual acti∣vity and exertion. The constant effort to dispel this darkness, even if it fail of success, invigorates and improves the thinking faculty. If the subjects of hu∣man inquiry were once exhausted, mind would probably stagnate; but the in∣finitely diversified forms and operations of nature, together with the endless food for speculation which metaphysical sub∣jects
<PB N="381" REF="397"/>
offer, prevent the possibility that such a period should ever arrive.</P>
<P>It is by no means one of the wisest sayings of Solomon, that <Q>there is no new thing under the sun.</Q> On the con∣trary, it is probable, that were the pre∣sent system to continue for millions of years, continual additions would be mak∣ing to the mass of human knowledge; and yet, perhaps, it may be a matter of doubt, whether, what may be called the capacity of mind, be in any marked and decided manner increasing. A Socrates, a Plato, or an Aristotle, however con∣fessedly inferior in knowledge to the philosophers of the present day, do not appear to have been much below them in intellectual capacity. Intellect rises from a speck, continues in vigour only for a certain period, and will not, per∣haps, admit, while on earth, of above
<PB N="382" REF="398"/>
a certain number of impressions. These impressions may, indeed, be infinitely modified, and from these various modi∣fications, added probably to a difference in the susceptibility of the original germs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is probable that no two grains of wheat are exactly alike. Soil undoubtedly makes the prin∣cipal difference in the blades that spring up; but probably not all. It seems natural to suppose some sort of difference in the original germs that are af∣terwards awakened into thought; and the extraor∣dinary difference of susceptibility in very young children seems to confirm the supposition.</NOTE>, arise the endless diversity of character that we see in the world; but reason and experience seem both to assure us, that the capacity of indi∣vidual minds does not increase in pro∣portion to the mass of existing know∣ledge. The finest minds seem to be formed rather by efforts at original
<PB N="383" REF="399"/>
thinking, by endeavours to form new combinations, and to discover new truths, than by passively receiving the impres∣sions of other men's ideas. Could we sup∣pose the period arrived, when there was no further hope of future discoveries; and the only employment of mind was to ac∣quire pre-existing knowledge, without any efforts to form new and original combinations; though the mass of hu∣man knowledge were a thousand times greater than it is at present; yet it is evident that one of the noblest stimu∣lants to mental exertion would have ceased; the finest feature of intellect would be lost; every thing allied to ge∣nius would be at an end; and it ap∣pears to be impossible, that, under such circumstances, any individuals could pos∣sess the same intellectual energies, as were possessed by a Locke, a Newton,
<PB N="384" REF="400"/>
or a Shakespear, or even by a Socrates, a Plato, an Aristotle, or a Homer.</P>
<P>If a revelation from heaven, of which no person could feel the smallest doubt, were to dispel the mists that now hang over metaphysical subjects; were to ex∣plain the nature and structure of mind, the affections and essences of all sub∣stances, the mode in which the Su∣preme Being operates in the works of the creation, and the whole plan and scheme of the Universe; such an ac∣cession of knowledge, so obtained, in∣stead of giving additional vigour and activity to the human mind, would, in all probability, tend to repress future ex∣ertion, and to damp the soaring wings of intellect.</P>
<P>For this reason I have never con∣sidered the doubts and difficulties that
<PB N="385" REF="401"/>
involve some parts of the sacred writings, as any argument against their divine original. The Supreme Being might, undoubtedly, have accompanied his re∣velations to man by such a succession of miracles, and of such a nature, as would have produced universal over∣powering conviction, and have put an end at once to all hesitation and dis∣cussion. But weak as our reason is to comprehend the plans of the Great Creator, it is yet sufficiently strong, to see the most striking objections to such a revelation. From the little we know of the structure of the human understanding, we must be convinced, that an overpowering conviction of this kind, instead of tending to the improve∣ment and moral amelioration of man, would act like the touch of a tor∣pedo on all intellectual exertion, and
<PB N="386" REF="402"/>
would almost put at end to the exist∣ence of virtue. If the scriptural denun∣ciations of eternal punishment were brought home with the same certainty to every man's mind, as that the night will follow the day, this one vast and gloomy idea would take such full pos∣session of the human faculties, as to leave no room for any other concep∣tions: the external actions of men would be all nearly alike: virtuous conduct would be no indication of virtuous dis∣position: vice and virtue would be blended together in one common mass; and, though the all-seeing eye of God might distinguish them, they must ne∣cessarily make the same impressions on man, who can judge only from ex∣ternal appearances. Under such a dis∣pensation, it is difficult to conceive how human beings could be formed to
<PB N="387" REF="403"/>
a detestation of moral evil, and a love and admiration of God, and of moral excellence.</P>
<P>Our ideas of virtue and vice are not, perhaps, very accurate and well-de∣fined; but few, I think, would call an action really virtuous, which was per∣formed simply and solely from the dread of a very great punishment, or the ex∣pectation of a very great reward. The fear of the Lord is very justly said to be the beginning of wisdom; but the end of wisdom is the love of the Lord, and the admiration of moral good. The denunciations of future punishment, contained in the scripures, seem to be well calculated to arrest the progress of the vicious, and awaken the attention of the careless; but we see, from repeated experience, that they are not accom∣panied
<PB N="388" REF="404"/>
with evidence of such a nature, as to overpower the human will, and to make men lead virtuous lives with vicious dispositions, merely from a dread of hereafter. A genuine faith, by which I mean, a faith that shews itself in all the virtues of a truly christian life, may generally be considered as an indica∣tion of an amiable and virtuous dispo∣sition, operated upon more by love than by pure unmixed fear.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the temptations to which man must necessarily be ex∣posed in this world, from the structure of his frame, and the operation of the laws of nature; and the consequent moral certainty, that many vessels will come out of this mighty creative fur∣nace in wrong shapes; it is perfectly impossible to conceive, that any of these
<PB N="389" REF="405"/>
creatures of God's hand can be con∣demned to eternal suffering. Could we once admit such an idea, all our natural conceptions of goodness and jus∣tice would be completely overthrown; and we could no longer look up to God as a merciful and righteous Being. But the doctrine of life and immorta∣lity which was brought to light by the gospel, the doctrine that the end of righteousness is everlasting life, but that the wages of sin are death, is in every res∣pect just and merciful, and worthy of the Great Creator. Nothing can ap∣pear more consonant to our reason, than that those beings which come out of the creative process of the world in lovely and beautiful forms, should be crowned with immortality; while those which come out mishapen, those whose minds are not suited to a purer and
<PB N="390" REF="406"/>
happier state of existence, should perish, and be condemned to mix again with their original clay. Eternal condemna∣tion of this kind may be considered as a species of eternal punishment; and it is not wonderful that it should be represented, sometimes, under images of suffering. But life and death, salva∣tion and destruction, are more frequently opposed to each other in the New Tes∣tament, than happiness and misery. The Supreme Being would appear to us in a very different view, if we were to consider him as pursuing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, instead of merely con∣demning to their original insensibility those beings, that, by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities suited to a purer state of hap∣piness.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="407"/>
Life is, generally speaking, a blessing independent of a future state. It is a gift which the vicious would not always be ready to throw away, even if they had no fear of death. The partial pain, therefore, that is inflicted by the Su∣preme Creator, while he is forming num∣berless beings to a capacity of the highest enjoyments, is but as the dust of the balance in comparison of the hap∣piness that is communicated; and we have every reason to think, that there is no more evil in the world, than what is absolutely necessary as one of the ingredients in the mighty process.</P>
<P>The striking necessity of general laws for the formation of intellect, will not in any respect be contradicted by one or two exceptions; and these evidently not intended for partial purposes, but
<PB N="392" REF="408"/>
calculated to operate upon a great part of mankind, and through many ages. Upon the idea that I have given of the formation of mind, the infringe∣ment of the general laws of nature, by a divine revelation, will appear in the light of the immediate hand of God mixing new ingredients in the mighty mass, suited to the particular state of the process, and calculated to give rise to a new and powerful train of impressions, tending to purify, exalt, and improve the human mind. The miracles that accompanied these reve∣lations when they had once excited the attention of mankind, and rendered it a matter of most interesting discussion, whether the doctrine was from God or man, had performed their part, had an∣swered the purpose of the Creator; and these communications of the divine will were afterwards left to make their
<PB N="393" REF="409"/>
way by their own intrinsic excellence; and by operating as moral motives, gra∣dually to influence and improve, and not to overpower and stagnate the fa∣culties of man.</P>
<P>It would be, undoubtedly, presump∣tuous to say, that the Supreme Being could not possibly have effected his purpose in any other way than that which he has chosen; but as the re∣velation of the divine will, which we possess, is attended with some doubts and difficulties; and as our reason points out to us the strongest objections to a revelation, which would force imme∣diate, implicit, universal belief; we have surely just cause to think that these doubts and difficulties are no ar∣gument against the divine origin of the scriptures; and that the species of evi∣dence which they possess is best suited
<PB N="394" REF="410"/>
to the improvement of the human fa∣culties, and the moral amelioration of mankind.</P>
<P>The idea that the impressions and excitements of this world are the in∣struments with which the Supreme Be∣ing forms matter into mind; and that the necessity of constant exertion to avoid evil, and to pursue good, is the principal spring of these impressions and excitements, seems to smooth many of the difficulties that occur in a contem∣plation of human life; and appears to me, to give a satisfactory reason for the existence of natural and moral evil; and, consequently, for that part of both, and it certainly is not a very small part, which arises from the principle of population. But, though upon this sup∣position, it seems highly improbable, that evil should ever be removed from
<PB N="395" REF="411"/>
the world; yet it is evident, that this impression would not answer the appa∣rent purpose of the Creator; it would not act so powerfully as an excitement to exertion, if the quantity of it did not diminish or increase, with the acti∣vity or the indolence of man. The continual variations in the weight, and in the distribution of this pressure, keep alive a constant expectation of throw∣ing it off.</P>
<Q><L>Hope springs eternal in the human breast,</L>
<L>Man never is, but always to be blest.</L></Q>
<P>Evil exists in the world, not to create despair, but activity. We are not pa∣tiently to submit to it, but to exert ourselves to avoid it. It is not only the interest, but the duty of every in∣dividual, to use his utmost efforts to remove evil from himself, and from as large a circle as he can influence;
<PB N="396" REF="412"/>
and the more he exercises himself in this duty, the more wisely he directs his efforts, and the more successful these efforts are; the more he will probably improve and exalt his own mind, and the more completely does he appear to fulfil the will of his Creator.</P>
