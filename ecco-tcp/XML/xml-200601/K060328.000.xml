<HEAD>THE
Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Treatise is but a
small part of a Volume of Cri∣ticism
intended to be publish'd
in Folio, in which in Treating of the works
of the most Celebrated English Poets De∣ceas'd,
I design'd to shew both by Reason
and Examples, that the use of Religion in
Poetry was absolutely necessary to raise it
to the greatest exaltation, of which so No∣ble
an Art is capable, and on the other side,
that Poetry was requisite to Religion in order to
its making more forcible Impressions upon
the Minds of Men.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
And this I thought would be an effectu∣al
way of Reconciling People to a Regu∣lated
Stage, in spight of the Grimaces of
some Spiritual Comedians; who have them∣selves
a mind to be the only Actors in
Vogue; and who in order to a total sup∣pression
of the Stage, have endeavour'd to
set up private Authorities against the
common Sense of Mankind, and the Er∣rors
of two or three Churchmen against
Divine Inspiration. For I appeal to any
impartial Reader, whether the constant
practice in all Ages of the best and the
bravest Nations in their most flourishing
States, may not pass for the common
Sense of Men: And we know very well
that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> whom we believe to be di∣vinely
inspir'd, has made use of Heathen
Poets nay ev'n Heathen Dramatick Poets,
for the Reformation of Mankind. Witness
that famous passage, <HI>Evil Communicati∣ons
corrupt good manners;</HI> which St.
<HI>Paul</HI> makes use of in his Second Epistle
to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and which <HI>Grotius</HI>
informs us that he borrow'd from the
<HI>Thais</HI> of the famous <HI>Menander.</HI> Now how
that which was the Language of the Holy
Ghost, in the Mouth of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> comes
to be the Language of the Devil in ours,
I believe our Bigots will find it a Difficult
matter to shew.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
It it plain then that these Persons by de∣signing
totally to suppress the Stage, which
is the only encouragement that we have
in these Islands of Poetry, manifestly in∣tended
to drive out so noble and useful an
Art from among us, and by that means
endeavour'd with all their might to weak∣en
the power of Religion, which has need
of Poetry to make its utmost Impression
upon the Minds of Men.</P>
<P>In short, almost all but the Ceremonial
and Historical part of the old Testament,
was deliver'd in Poetry and that is almost
Half of it. And a considerable part of the
Doctrine of the Gospel was deliver'd in Pa∣rables,
which, as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> has just∣ly
observ'd in his Advancement of Lear∣ning
<HI>Lib. 2 Chap.</HI> I. are a kind of Di∣vine
Poesy. I might here very truly ob∣serve,
that not only <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Song and part of the Prophets, but seve∣ral
too of our Saviours Parables, are tho'
not Dramatick Poems, yet Poesy that is
Dramatical, that is Poesy in which Persons
are introduc'd who are talking in Dia∣logue.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
From what has been said, this Conse∣quence
must undeniably follow, that either
they who deliver'd our Religion were mi∣staken
in the manner of doing it, which
will by no means consist with our Belief
of the Divinity of one of them, or the
Divine Inspiration of the Rest, or that
our Religion must be most powerfully pro∣pagated
by the same means, by which it
was at first deliver'd.</P>
<P>I believe that it would be an easie
matter to prove, that it was the use of
exalted Poesy, such as the lofty Hymn of
St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> that blew up the Flame of
Christian zeal to such a transporting
height, in the Primitive and Apostolical
times, and that the neglect of so Divine
an art, has not only in these latter Days
considerably lessen'd the force of Religion,
but has with some People among us gone
a very great way towards the making the
Publick Worship contemptible. But I leave
it to our Prelates and Pastors to consider,
whether, since they are satisfy'd that there
is a necessity, for an Harmonious and a
Numerous Style, in some parts of our Pub∣lick
Worship, they ought so long to have
remain'd contented with the vile Meetre
of <HI>Hopkins,</HI> and by that proceeding to
suffer the most Lofty and most Pathetick
<PB REF="6"/>
Divine Poetry to be Burlesqu'd and Ri∣dicul'd
in our Churches, which is all one,
as if each Sunday they should dress up a
Bishop in some Antick Habit, and ex∣pose
him in that merry Garb in Order to
raise the Veneration of the People.</P>
<P>That Poetry is necessary for the infor∣cing
Religion upon the Minds of Men,
may I think appear very plainly from
what has been said, and from what will be
said upon that Subject in the following
Treatise. But since our Clergy by their con∣stant
practise appear to be already satis∣fyed
of it, I leave it to them to consi∣der,
whether they ought not rather to
make it part of their business, to set Po∣etry
and consequently the Stage upon a
good Foot, than to endeavour with all their
might to drive out both from among us.</P>
<P>Since I mention'd my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> a∣bove,
I desire the Readers leave to lay
before him a most Beautiful Passage of
that great genius concerning the worth
and the use of Poetry, which he esteems
to be the Second principal Bruanch of
Learning.</P>
<P>As for Narrative Poesy (says he in
the 13 <HI>Ch.</HI> of the 2 <HI>Lib.</HI> of his Ad∣vancement
of Learning) or, if you
<PB REF="7"/>
please, Heroical, so you understand it
of the Matter, not of the Verse, it
seems to be rais'd altogether from a
noble Foundation, which makes much
for the Dignity of Man's Nature.
For seeing the sensible World is in
Dignity inferior to the Soul of Man,
Poesy seems to endow human Nature,
with that which History denies, and
to give satisfaction to the Mind,
with at least the Shadow of things,
where the Substance cannot be had.
For if the matter be throughly consi∣der'd
a strong Argument may be drawn
from Poetry, that a more stately
Greatness of things, a more perfect
Order, and a more beautiful Variety,
delights the Soul of Man, than can
be any way found in Nature, since
the fall. Wherefore seeing the Acts
and events, which are the Subject of
True History, are not of that ampli∣tude
as to content the Mind of Man,
Poesy is ready at Hand to fain Acts
more Heroical. Because true History
reports the Successes of Business not
proportionable to the merit of Vir∣tues
and Vices, Poesy corrects it, and
presents Events and Fortunes ac∣cording
to Desert; and according to
the Law of Providence. Because true
History, through the frequent Satiety
<PB REF="8"/>
and Similitude of things, works a
Distast and Misprision in the Mind
of Men, Poetry Cheereth and Refresh∣es
the Soul; Chanting things rare and
various, and full of Vicissitudes, so as
Poetry serveth and conferreth to De∣lectation,
Magnanimity, and Morality;
and therefore it may seem deserved∣ly
to have some Participation of Di∣vineness;
because it doth raise the
Mind, and exalt the Spirit with high
Raptures, by proportioning the Shews
of things to the Desires pf the Mind,
and not submitting the Mind to
things, as Reason and History do.
And by these Allurements and Con∣gruities,
whereby it cherisheth the Soul
of Men, joyned also with Consort of
Musick, whereby it may more sweet∣ly
insinuate it self, it hath won such
Access, that it hath been in Estima∣tion,
even in Rude Times, and Bar∣barous
Nations, when other Learning
stood excluded.</P>
<P>But because that Poetry which we call
Heroick, has been but barely neglected
among us, and the great Cry has been
against the Dramatick, let us see what the
same extraordinary Person says in De∣fence
of that.</P>
<P><PB REF="9"/>
Dramatick or Representative Poesy,
says he, which brings the World up∣on
the Stage, is of excellent use if it
were not abus'd. For the instructi∣ons
and Corruptions of the Stage may
be great; but the Corruptions in this
kind abound; the Discipline is altoge∣ther
neglected in our times. For al∣tho'
in Modern Commonwealths, Stage-Plays
be but esteemed a Sport or Pas∣time,
unless they draw from the Satyr
and be mordant; yet the Care of the An∣tients
was, that the Stage should in∣struct
the Minds of Men unto Vir∣tue.
Nay, wise Men and great Phi∣losophers,
have accounted it as the
Archet or Musical Bow of the Mind.
And certainly it is most true, and as
it were a Secret of Nature, that the
Minds of Men are more patent to
Affections, and Impressions Congregate
than Solitary.</P>
<P>In this last Observation which is per∣fectly
Beautiful, my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> has gi∣ven
a very solid Reason, why the Drama
must be more useful than History, and more
prevalent than Philosophy. And a little
lower he has given two more, though he has
applied them to a sort of Poetry which is
somewhat different, and those are, that
<PB REF="10"/>
Dramatick Fables are more sensible than
Arguments; and more fit than Examples.</P>
<P>At the same time, that extraordinary
Man declares like a most just and discern∣ing
Judge, that the Modern Stage was but
a Shadow of the Antient, and an imperfect
Shadow; that it had something of its Shew,
but nothing of its Reality; that is, that it
was not only a vain and an empty, but a
dangerous Amusement. And he plainly
taxes the Modern Policy with the Neg∣lect
of its Discipline. Indeed in this as
well as other things, there is as great a
difference between Antient and Modern
Policy, as there is between Antient and
Modern Extent of Empire.</P>
<P>But the Wisdom of the Queen can ne∣ver
be too much extolled, who has vouch∣safed
to take care of that which all Her
Predecessors neglected.</P>
<P>That Discerning Princess is resolved to
support the Stage, that it may be instru∣mental
to the Reforming Her People; and
She is resolved to Regulate it, that it
may no longer be justly accus'd of corrupt∣ing
their Manners.</P>
<P>The following Treatise, as has been said
above, is but a small Portion of a much
<PB REF="11"/>
larger which was design'd for the Improve∣ment
of Modern Poetry, and of the Dra∣ma
particularly. And here I desire the
Reader's Leave to do two things. First
to lay down the Design and Method of the
larger Treatise, and then to give an Ac∣count
to the World why no more is Pub∣lished.</P>
<P>The Design then, and the Method of
the whole Treatise, as they were deliver'd
in the Second Proposal, are as follows.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="proposal">
<PB REF="12"/>
<HEAD>THE
PROPOSAL.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FIrst,</HI> The Design is To restore
Poetry to all its Greatness, and
to all its Innocence.</P>
<P>That Poetry is miserably fall'n, is,
I suppose, granted: And, as there
never was more occasion for a just
and impartial <HI>Criticism</HI> on account
of the generality of the Writers;
so, there never was more necessity
for one on account of the Readers
and the Spectators. For the taste
of both the Readers and the Specta∣tors
was never so debauch'd as if is
<PB REF="13"/>
at present; of which we have given
the Reasons in another place. Some
of them would be thought to ap∣prove
of every thing that they
either Read or See, and value them∣selves
upon that; that is, upon their
want of Discernment to distinguish
right from wrong: Others are so
squeamish, that they like nothing,
and value themselves▪ even upon
that too; that is, upon the sickliness
and the unsoundness of their Minds;
because he who likes nothing tastes
nothing, and want of Taste is want
of Sense. But this is not all: even
they who pretend to like nothing,
will at the Play-houses be pleas'd
with ev'ry thing; and they who
would be thought to approve of eve∣ry
thing, like nothing long; For
nothing but Truth can be long e∣steem'd,
and Truth it self, to be
long esteem'd, must be distinguish'd
from Falshood. From these ran∣dom
ways of Judging it comes to
pass, that this Town, in the com∣pass
of ten Years, happens to have
one and the same Author in the
<PB REF="14"/>
greatest Admiration and in the ut∣most
Contempt; which is infinitely
a greater Satyr upon the Town,
than it can be on the Author; for
the Town is certainly in the
wrong in one of the Extreams at
least, and perhaps in both; whereas
the Authors, for the most part,
give no occasion for either of them.
This random or this partial way
of Judging, has been the cause
that Poetry is banish'd from the
rest of <HI>Europe,</HI> and is upon its last
Legs in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Design of the foresaid Trea∣tise
is, not only to retrieve so noble
an Art, and to fix the Rules both
of Writing and of Judging, that
both Readers and Writers may be
at some certainty; but, to raise it
to a height which it has never
known before among us, and to
restore it, as we said above, to
all its Greatness, and to all its
Innocence.</P>
<P><PB REF="15"/>
But whereas several may imagine
that the Design is chimerical, of
restoring Poetry either to its Great∣ness
or to its Innocence, we think
it proper to satisfie the Reader, in
as few words as we can, that
both may be easily effected.</P>
<P>1. Poetry may easily be restored
to its former Greatness, because
the discovering the Cause of a Di∣sease
is more than half the Cure
of it: but the true and almost
only Cause of the Declention of
Poetry, that Cause which has lain
hid for so many Ages, has been
already discovered in a little Tract
that was published two Years
ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Advancement and Reformation of Modern Poetry▪</NOTE>, for which I have the Opini∣on
of several of the best Judges
in <HI>England,</HI> and that matter will
be set in so clear a Light in the
beginning of the foresaid Treatise,
without repeating any thing that
was said before, or at least as little
as may be, as may satisfie the most
incredulous. But,</P>
<P><PB REF="16"/>
2. Poetry may easily be restored
to its Innocence by taking a pro∣per
Method, a Method that may
be more prevalent with the Wri∣ters
than either Law or Philosophy,
which have been us'd in vain. For
let us but consider the Character
that <HI>Horace</HI> has giv'n of a Poet,
<Q><L>Vatis avarus</L>
<L>Non temere est animus, versus amet, hoc studet unum,</L>
<L>Detrimenta, fugas servorum; incendia ridet.</L></Q></P>
<P>In short, a Poet will contemn
every thing but the acquiring the
Reputation of a good Poet. This
is what he makes his only Busi∣ness,
and the sole design of his Life;
and there is no Reprimand that
you can give him, and no Remon∣strance
that you can make him,
that he will not laugh at, until
you convince him that he is an ill
Poet. And indeed he is partly in
the right; for an ill Poet is ten
<PB REF="17"/>
times more ridiculous than a
Blockhead of any other Profession:
for an ill Physician, or an ill Law∣yer,
know their own Ignorance,
and make it their business to be
esteem'd by the People: but, on
the contrary, an ill Poet is found
out by every body, and admires
himself, than which nothing can
be more a Jest. So that there is
nothing he will refuse to do to
avoid the Infamy of that Reputa∣tion.
From whence it follows that
in the foresaid <HI>Criticism</HI> there is a
Motive that will work more strong∣Iy
upon them than the Censures
of our Reformers: for there we
clearly shew them, that Poetry, by
losing its Innocence, loses its very
Nature; for if Poetry be more
philosophical, and more instru∣ctive,
than History, as <HI>Aristo∣tle</HI>
is pleas'd to affirm of it, and
no Man ever knew the Nature ei∣ther
of Poetry, or of History, or
of Philosophy, better than he did;
why then that Art, or rather that
Artifice, with which a great ma∣ny
Writers of Verses and Plays de∣bauch
<PB REF="18"/>
and corrupt the People, is
a thing to which Poetry is as di∣rectly
contrary, as a Virgin is to
a Whore. And these People are no
more Poets, than those Empricks
are Physicians who make their <HI>Jack-Puddings</HI>
swallow Potions to re∣commend
them to the People,</P>
<P>In the foresaid Treatise we clear∣ly
shew them, that Piety and Vir∣tue
was not only the first Original,
but that it has been, is and will
be, the only solid Basis, nay and
the very Life and Soul of the Great∣er
Poetry. That the farther Poe∣try
declines from that, the farther
it recedes from its very Nature
and Essence; and that the true
Poetry is as inconsistent and as
incompatible with Vice, as the
Harmony, and Light, and Rap∣tures
of Heaven with the gloomy
Horrors of Hell; and the proving
this in so clear a manner as we
pretend to do, will oblige those
Poets who are never so profligate
in their Inclinations, to be virtu∣ous
at least in their Writings.</P>
<P><PB REF="19"/>
Both they and their Readers
will then be satisfied, that the true
Poetical Genius is a great and a
sacred thing; and, to quote an Ad∣mirable
passage from <HI>Milton,</HI> 'Is,
wherever it is found, the inspir'd
Gift of God, rarely bestow'd, but
yet to some (says he) in ev'ry
Nation, tho' most abuse it: and is
of power, beside the Office of a
Pulpit, to imbreed and cherish in
a great People the Seeds of Vir∣tue
and publick Civility, to allay
the Perturbations of the Mind,
and set the Affections in a right
Tune, to celebrate in glorious and
lofty Hymns the Throne and
Equipage of God's Almightiness,
and what he works, and what
he suffers to be wrought with
high providence in his Church; to
sing victorious Agonies of Mar∣tyrs
and Saints, the Deeds and
Triumphs of just and pious Na∣tions,
doing valiantly, thro' Faith,
against the Enemies of Christ; to
deplore the general Relapses of
<PB REF="20"/>
Kingdoms and States from Justice
and God's true Worship. Lastly,
Whatever in Religion is holy and
sublime, in Virtue amiable or
grave, whatever hath Passion or
Admiration in all the changes of
that which is call'd Fortune from
without, or the wily Subtleties
and Refluxes of Man's Thoughts
from within; all these things
with a solid and treatable Smooth∣ness
to point out and describe;
teaching over the whole Book of
Sanctity and Virtue, thro' all the
instances of example, with such de∣light,
to those especially of soft
and delicious temper, who will
not so much as look upon Truth
her self, unless they see her ele∣gantly
drest; that whereas the
paths of Honesty arid Good-life ap∣pear
now rugged and difficult,
tho' they be indeed easie and plea∣sant,
they would then appear to
all Men both easie and pleasant,
tho' they were rugged and diffi∣cult
indeed. And what a Bene∣fit
this would be to our Youth
<PB REF="21"/>
and Gentry (<HI>continues he</HI>) may be
soon guest by what we know of
the Corruption and Bane which
they suck in daily from the Wri∣tings
and Interludes of libidinous
and ignorant Poetasters, who ha∣ving
scarce ever heard of that
which is the main Consistence of
a true Poem, the Choice of such
persons as they ought to introduce,
and what is moral and decent to
each one, do for the most part lap
up vicious Principles in sweet
Pills to be swallow'd down, and
make the taste of virtuous Do∣cuments
harsh and four.' Thus
far goes <HI>Milton:</HI> And the Reader
may see that it was his Opinion,
That tho Poetry was in the main
miserably sunk among us; yet, that
it might be restor'd to its Inno∣cence,
and its Greatness. In or∣der
then to the doing this we
come to display,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Method that we
follow in the foremention'd <HI>Criti∣cism</HI>
<PB REF="22"/>
We begin then with a <HI>Criticism</HI>
upon Poetry in general; in which
we endeavour to shew its Nature,
and its End, and the means which
it ought to use for the attaining
that End. And then we come to,
divide Poetry into its two great
Branches, the (Greater and the Less.</P>
<P>1. We treat of the Greater Poe∣try,
shew what its Nature and its
End are; and that the only certain
Method for the attaining its End,
is, the keeping strictly up to its Na∣ture,
which seems to have been hi∣therto
not very clearly understood.
And here we shall lay down some
general Rules, which are both few
and short, but eternal and unal∣terable;
and for the want of ob∣serving
which, it will appear
throughout this whole Treatise,
that the very best among the An∣cients,
and among the Moderns,
have not only made gross Mistakes,
but have deviated sometimes, in a
great degree, from the Art.</P>
<P><PB REF="23"/>
And here too We endeavour to
shew the mutual Dependance that
the Greater Poetry has on Reli∣gion,
and Religion on the Greater
Poetry; and to make it appear,
that all those parts of the Old Testa∣ment
which were writ id Verse,
ought to be translated in Verse, by
Reasons which may have force e∣nough
to convince us, that Verse
translated into Prose is but half
translated.</P>
<P>When we have done this, We
come to Heroick Poetry; which
being a Branch of the Greater
Poetry, must have the same End,
and must participate of the same
Nature; and must besides, have
something particular in its Nature
to distinguish it from the other two
Branches, which are Tragedy, and
the Greater Ode. But because too
much bare Speculation may prove
tedious to several Readers, we
shew what every Poet who writes
an Epick Poem is oblig'd to do, to
make that Poem keep to the Nature
<PB REF="24"/>
of Epick Poetry in general, and to
its own: This, I say, we endeavour
to shew, not by laying down the
Rules after the common Method,
but by shewing what <HI>Virgil</HI> has
done; because that great Poet is so
exact, that he may be said to have
written a <HI>Criticism</HI> upon Epick
Poetry by Examples, and because
he is now, by Mr. <HI>Dryden's</HI> Tran∣slation,
to be reckon'd among our
own Poets; and so comes within
the compass of my Design.</P>
<P>When by doing this we have
laid down the Rules, we come
briefly to examine, Whether those
Rules are always to be kept invio∣lable;
and if they are not, in what
parts, and by whom, they may be
alter'd. Then we shew how <HI>Spencer,</HI>
by not following those Rules, fell so
very far short of the Ancients; And
afterwards we endeavour to make
it appear, how <HI>Milton,</HI> by daring
to break a little loose from them
in some particulars, kept up in se∣veral
others to the Nature of the
<PB REF="25"/>
Greater Poetry in general, and of E∣pick
Poetry in particular, better
than the best of the Ancients. Af∣ter
this we treat of the other <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Poets, who have written any
thing that comes near to Heroick
Poetry; and shew of them all, as we
go along, how they differ from one
another, how from the best of the
Ancient Poets, and the best of the
Moderns of other Countries.</P>
<P>The Branch of the Greater Poetry
which we consider next is Tragedy,
which we treat of after the same
manner with Heroick Poetry, and
shew what ev'ry one who writes a
Tragedy is oblig'd to do, to make
that Poem come up to the Nature
of the Greater Poetry in general,
and of Tragedy in particular, by
shewing what <HI>Sophocles</HI> has done in
his <HI>OEdipus</HI> (which will be there
translated) and for what Reasons;
where we endeavour to display the
Beauties of his admirable Conduct,
and to clear the Moral by a very
different Method from what <HI>Mon∣sieur
Dacier</HI> has taken. And af∣ter
<PB REF="26"/>
that by doing this we have
laid down the Rules, the first of any
length that were ever extant in Eng∣lish
we by those examine the Plays
of our most celebrated Tragick Poets,
in their Fables, Characters. Senti∣ments,
Expressions, Harmony; shew
what distinguishes them, from one
another, from the best of the Anci∣ents,
and the most famous Mo∣derns
of other Countries. And
here we make it our business to
shew how much the present <HI>English</HI>
Stage is degenerated from the Virtue
and Greatness of the Ancient Tra∣gedy,
and what is to be done to
restore Modern Tragedy first to the
Innocence, and secondly to the
Greatness of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Stage.
And here we examine whether it is
not possible to advance <HI>English</HI> Tra∣gedy
to a greater Height than ever
the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poets arriv'd.</P>
<P>In the next place we descend to the
third and last Branch of the Greater
Poetry, which is the Greater Ode,
which we treat of after the same
<PB REF="27"/>
manner with the two preceding, and
shew what the composer of such an
Ode is oblig'd to do, to make it keep
up to the Nature of the Greater Poe∣try
in general, and to its own. And
here we have occasion to take no∣tice,
that of these three Branches of
Poetry, the Ode is the most dege∣nerated:
For since the Nature of
Poetry consists in Passion; and that
of the Greater Poetry in great Passi∣on,
as we make it appear in the
foremention'd <HI>Crticism;</HI> and since
that which we commonly call Pa∣ssion
is very rarely to be found in
the Greater Ode, it follows that
the excellence of the Greater Ode
must consist in extraordinary Pa∣ssion,
which can be nothing but
strong <HI>Enthusiasm;</HI> but Religion is
the greatest, noblest, strongest
source of <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> as we very
clearly shew; so that the Modern
Ode, by for saking Religion, and be∣coming
for the most part prophane,
has parted with that from which
it deriv'd its greatest excellence.</P>
<P><PB REF="28"/>
And that the excellence of the
Greater Ode is deriv'd from Reli∣gion,
we make appear not only
by the Examples of those very
few which are admirable among
our own, but by those of <HI>Pindar</HI>
and <HI>Horace;</HI> and we shew that
the first of those great Masters
was so throughly convinc'd of this
at the same time, that he was
oblig'd, by the desire of Gain, to
celebrate the Triumphs of worth∣less
Coachmen and Jockeys, that
his numerous extravagant Digressi∣ons
are to be attributed, in a
great measure, to that Conviction
join'd with that Obligation. When
we have done this,</P>
<P>2. We descend to the other di∣vision
of Poetry, which is the
Less and shall treat of those
Branches of it in which our <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Poets are most concern'd, after
the same Method that we treated
of those of the Greater. Where
first we shall speak of the Little
<PB REF="29"/>
Ode, and shew for what Reasons
our <HI>English</HI> Poets have, for the
most part miscarried in it. Then
we shall give the Reader a large
<HI>Criticism</HI> upon Comedy, the first of
any Moment that will be extant
upon it in any Language. And
here we shall endeavour to make
it appear, that as the Moderns
have apparently the advantage of
the Ancients in Comedy, the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
have it of the rest of the Mo∣derns.</P>
<P>We shall end with a <HI>Criticism</HI>
upon Satyr, where we shall shew
the true difference between that
and a Libel or Lampoon; and the
usefulness of the one, and destru∣ctiveness
of the other.</P>
<P>Thus have we laid before the
Reader. the Design and Method of
the Work. But because the dis∣cerning
Reader cannot but see,
that it is impossible for any Book∣seller
to make it worth the Un∣dertaker's
Trouble in employing so
<PB REF="30"/>
much Time and Thought as so
great and important a Design re∣quires,
the lovers of <HI>Criticism</HI> are
therefore desir'd, at least those who
have Spirit enough to promote so
generous an Undertaking, to en∣courage
it by their Subscriptions at
the Rate of a Guinea a Book, pay∣ing
half a Guinea down at the
time of subscribing, and half at
the delivery of the Book in
Quires; the Undertaker at the
same time, promising, that not a
Book shall be printed more than
the number subscribed.</P>
<P>For the greater variety, the Lives
of the several <HI>English</HI> Poets will be
added in their proper places.</P>

<HEAD>SPECIMEN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being the Substance of what
will be said in the Begin∣ning
of the Criticism upon
Mil-ton.</HEAD>
<P>THE next Poet of whom
we shall treat is <HI>Mil∣ton,</HI>
one of the greatest and
most daring Genius's that
has appear'd in the World,
and who has made his Coun∣try
a glorious present of the
most lofty, but most irregu∣lar
Poem, that has been pro∣duc'd
by the Mind of Man.
That great Man had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> desire
to give the World something
like an Epick Poem; but he resolv'd
at the same time to
<PB REF="32"/>
break thro' the Rules of
<HI>Aristotle.</HI> Not that he was ig∣norant
of them, or contem∣n'd
them. On the contrary, no
Man knew them better, or e∣steemed
them more, because no
Man had an Understanding
that was more able to com∣prehend
the necessity of them;
and therefore when he men∣tion'd
them in the little
Treatise which he wrote to
Mr. <HI>Hartlib,</HI> he calls the
Art which treats of them, a
sublime Art. But at the same
time he had discrenemnt e∣nough
to see, that if he wrote
a Poem which was within
the compass of them, he should
be subjected to the same Fate
which has attended all who
have wrote Epick Poems e∣ver
since the time of <HI>Homer;</HI>
<PB REF="33"/>
and that is to be a Copyist
instead of an Original. Tis
true, the Epick Poets who
have liv'd since <HI>Homer,</HI> have
most of them been Originals
in their Fables, which are
the very Souls of their Po∣ems;
but in their manner of
treating those Fables, they
have too frequently been Co∣pyists,
They have Copyed
the Spirit and the Images of
<HI>Homer;</HI> even the great <HI>Vir∣gil</HI>
himself is not to be ex∣cepted.
<HI>Milton</HI> was the first,
who in the space of almost
4000▪ Years, resolved, for his
Country's Honour and his
own, to present the World
with an Original Poem;
that is to say, a Poem that
should have his own Thoughts,
his own Images, and his
<PB REF="34"/>
own Spirit. In order to this
he was resolved to write a
Poem, that, by vertue of its
extraordinary Subject, cannot
so properly be said to be a∣gainst
the Rules, as it may
be affirmed to be above them
all. He had observ'd, that
<HI>Aristotle</HI> had drawn his Rules
which he has given us for
Epick Poetry from the Re∣flections
which he had made
upon <HI>Homer.</HI> Now he knew
very well, that in <HI>Homer</HI> the
Action lay chiefly between
Man and Man: For <HI>Achilles</HI>
and <HI>Hector</HI> are properly the
Principals, and the Gods are
but Seconds. He was resol∣ved
therefore, that his Prin∣cipals
should be the Devil on
one side and Man on the
other: and the Devil is pro∣perly
<PB REF="35"/>
his Hero, because he
gets the better. All the per∣sons
in his Poem, excepting
two, are either Divine or In∣fernal.
So that most of the
Persons and particularly one
of the Principals, being so
very different from what
<HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Aristotle</HI> ever
thought of, could not possi∣bly
be subjected to their
Rules, either for the Cha∣racters
or the Incidents. We
shall now shew for what Rea∣sons
the choice of <HI>Milton</HI>'s
Subject, as it set him free
from the Obligation which
he lay under to the Poetical
Laws, so it necessarily threw
him upon new Thoughts,
new Images, and an Origi∣nal
Spirit. In the next place
we shall shew, that his
<PB REF="36"/>
Thoughts, his Images, and
by consequence too his Spirit,
are actually new, and dif∣ferent
from those of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
and <HI>Virgil.</HI> Thirdly,
We shall shew, that besides
their Newness, they have
vastly the Advantage of those
of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> And
we shall make this appear
from several things, but prin∣cipally
from the Description of
Hell, which has been describ'd
by those three great Poets
with all their Force and
with all their Art. After
that, we shall proceed to say
something of <HI>Milton's</HI> Expres∣sion
and his Harmony; and
then we shall come to mark
his Defects with so much
the more exactness, because
some of them ought to be
<PB REF="37"/>
avoided with the utmost
Caution, as being so great,
that they would be Insup∣portable
in any one who had
not his extraordinary Distin∣guishing
Qualities.</P>
<P>Thus have we laid before the Reader the
Design and Method, and Specimen of the
larger Treatise, It now remains that I
should give an Account why so small a
part of it is Publish'd. As soon as I set
about the Performance, I easily foresaw
that it would be a three Years Labour, and the
Judicious Reader, upon considering the Pro∣posal,
cannot but be convinc'd of it. Yet
after I had been for a whole Year Digesting
my own Thoughts, and considering other
Peoples, and making all sorts of Prepa∣rations
for the due Execution of so great a
Design: I saw that all the Persons who
had Subscrib'd, were they whose Names the
Reader will find in the Order of their Sub∣scribing.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Design of the following Treatise,
is, the Reestablishment of Poetry.</HEAD>
<P>THE design of the ensuing
Treatise, whether we consider
the Importance or the Extent
of it, is perhaps the Greatest in this
kind of Writing, that has been con∣ceived
by the Moderns; for 'tis no
less than an Attempt to restore
and reestablish the noblest Art in
<PB N="2" REF="47"/>
every Branch of it; an Art that by
the Barbarity of the Times is fall'n
and sunk in them all, and has been
driv'n and banish'd from every
Country excepting <HI>England</HI> alone,
and is even here so miserably fall'n
for the most part by the extrava∣gance
of its Professors, and by the
unskilfulness of its Admirers, that
we have reason to apprehend it to
be departing from hence too.</P>
<P>That Poetry is the noblest of all
Arts, and by consequence the most
instructive and most beneficial to
Mankind, may be prov'd by the
concording Testimony of the greatest
Men, who have lived in every Age;
the greatest Philosophers, the grea∣test
Heroes, and the greatest States∣men,
who have as it were unani∣mously
cherish'd, esteem'd, admir'd
it, and never has it been disesteem'd
or neglected by any but some pre∣tenders
to Wisdom, and by some
contemptible Politicasters, Persons
who have got into the management
of Affairs only by the weakness of
those who have employ'd them,
and who have utterly wanted Ca∣pacity
<PB N="3" REF="48"/>
to know what a glorious use
may be made of it, for the benefit
of civil Society: But in the sequel
of this Discourse, by discovering
the Nature of Poetry in general,
(which seems to me to have been
hitherto but little understood) I
shall clearly shew its Excellence,
and the Importance of this Under∣taking.
And by laying down ei∣ther
the general Rules of it, or by
tracing out that sublime Art, which
to make use of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Expression,
teaches what the Laws are of a true
Epick Poem, what of a Dramatick,
what of a Lyrick, what Decorum
is, what is the grand Master-piece
to observe. I shall not only lay a
good Foundation for the judging of
the Performance of the several Po∣ets,
whose Works I have underta∣ken
to examine, but shall as <HI>Milton</HI>
says in his Treatise of Education to
Mr. <HI>Hartlip,</HI> soon make the World
perceive what despicable Creatures
our common Rhymers and Play-Wrights
are, and shew them what
Religious, what Glorious and Mag∣nificent
Use may be made of Po∣etry,
<PB N="4" REF="49"/>
both in Divine and in Hu∣man
things.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. That Poetry is to be Establi∣shed,
by laying down Rules.</HEAD>
<P>THAT an Art so Divine in
its Institution, is sunk and
profaned, and miserably debased,
is a thing that is confest by all. But
since Poetry is fallen from the Ex∣cellence
which it once attained to,
it must be fallen either by the want
of Parts, or want of Industry, or
by the Errors of its Professors. But
that it cannot be for want of Parts,
we have shewn clearly in the Ad∣vancement
of modern Poetry; nor
can it be supposed to be for want of
Industry, since so many of its Pro∣fessors
have no other Dependance?
It remains then that it must have
fall'n by their Errors, and for want
of being guided right. Since there∣fore
<PB N="5" REF="50"/>
'tis for want of knowing by
what Rules they ought to proceed,
that Poetry is fall'n so low, it follows
then that it is the laying down of
those Rules alone, that can re-estab∣lish
it. In short, Poetry is either
an Art, or Whimsie and Fanaticism.
If it is an Art, it follows that it must
propose an end to it self, and after∣wards
lay down proper Means for
the attaining that end: For this is
undeniable, that there are proper
Means for the attaining of every
end, and those proper Means in Po∣etry,
we call the Rules. Again, if
the end of Poetry be to instruct and
reform the World, that is, to bring
Mankind from Irregularity, Extra∣vagance
and Confusion, to Rule and
Order, how this should be done by
a thing that is in it self irregular and
extravagant, is difficult to be con∣ceived.
Besides, the work of every
reasonable Creature must derive its
Beauty from Regularity, for Reason
is Rule and Order, and nothing can
be irregular either in our Concepti∣ons
or our Actions, any further than
it swerves from Rule, that is, from
<PB N="6" REF="51"/>
Reason. As Man is the more perfect,
the more he resembles his Creator:
The Works of Man must needs be
more perfect, the more they resemble
his Makers. Now the Works of God
tho' infinitely various, are extream∣ly
regular.</P>
<P>The Universe is regular in all
its Parts, and it is to that exact
Regularity that it owes its admi∣rable
Beauty. The Microcosm owes
the Beauty and Health both of its
Body and Soul to Order, and the De∣formity
and Distempers of both, to
nothing but the want of Order. Man
was created like the rest of the Crea∣tures,
regular, and as long as he re∣mained
so he continued happy; but
as soon as he fell from his Primitive
State, by transgressing Order, Weak∣ness
and Misery was the immediate
Consequence of that Universal Dis∣order
that immediately followed.in
his Conceptions, in his Passions and
Actions.</P>
<P>The great design of Arts is to
restore the decays that happen'd
to Humane Nature by the Fall,
by restoring Order: The design of
<PB N="7" REF="52"/>
Logick is to bring back Order,
and Rule, and Method to our Con∣ceptions,
the want of which causes
most of our Ignorance, and all our
Errors. The design of moral Phy∣losophy
is to cure the disorder that
is found in our Passions, from which
proceeds all our Unhappiness, and all
our Vice; as from the due order that
is seen in them, comes all our Ver∣tue
and all our Pleasure. But how
should these Arts reestablish Order,
unless they themselves were Regu∣lar?
Those Arts that make the Sen∣ses
instrumental to the Pleasure of
the Mind, as Painting and Musick,
do it by a great deal of Rule and
Order, since therefore Poetry com∣prehends
the force of all these
Arts of Logick, of Ethicks, of
Eloquence, of Painting, of Musick;
can any thing be more ridiculous
than to imagine, that Poetry it self
should be without Rule and Or∣der?</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="8" REF="53"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. What Poetry is, and that it
attains its end by exciting
of Passion.</HEAD>
<P>WE have said above, that as
Poetry is an Art, it must have
a certain end, and that there must
be means that are proper for the
attaining that end, which means
are otherwise call'd the Rules: But
that we may make this appear
the more plainly, let us declare what
Poetry is. Poetry then is an Art, by
which a Poet excites Passion (and
for that very cause entertains Sense)
in order to satisfie and improve, to
delight and reform the Mind, and
so to make Mankind happier and
better; from which it appears that
Poetry has two Ends, a subordinate
and a final one, the subordinate one
is Pleasure, and the final one is In∣struction.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="54"/>
First, The subordinate end of Poe∣try
is to please, for that Pleasure is the
business and design of Poetry is evi∣dent,
because Poetry unless it pleases,
nay and pleases to a height, is the
most contemptible thing in the
World; other things may be born
with if they are indifferent, but
Poetry unless it is transporting is
abominable: nay it has only the
Name of Poetry, so inseparable is
Pleasure from the very nature of
the Thing.</P>
<P>But Secondly, The final End of
Poetry is to reform the Manners;
as Poetry is an Art, Instruction
must be its final End; but either
that Instruction must consist in re∣forming
the Manners, or it can∣not
instruct at all, and consequent∣ly
be an Art; for Poetry pretends
to no other Instruction as its final
End: But since the final End of
Poetry is to reform the Manners,
nothing can be according to the true
Art of it which is against Religion,
or which runs counter to Moral Ver∣tue,
or to the true Politicks, and to
the Liberty of Mankind; and every
<PB N="10" REF="55"/>
thing which is against the last, tends
to the Corruption and Destruction
of Mankind: And consequently eve∣ry
thing against the last, must be ut∣terly
inconsistent with the true Art
of Poetry.</P>
<P>Now the proper Means for Poe∣try,
to attain both its subordinate
and final End, is by exciting Passion.
<HI>First,</HI> The subordinate End of Poe∣try,
which is to please, is attained
by exciting Passion, because every
one who is pleased is moved, and
either desires, or rejoices, or ad∣mires,
or hopes, or the like. As
we are moved by Pleasure which
is Happiness, to do every thing
we do, we may find upon a little
Reflection, That every Man is in∣cited
by some Passion or other, ei∣ther
to Action, or to Contemplation;
and Passion is the result either of
Action or of Contemplation, as
long as either of them please, and
the more either of them pleases,
the more they are attended with
Passion. The satisfaction that we
receive from Geometry it self comes
from the joy of having found out
<PB N="11" REF="56"/>
Truth, and the desire of finding
more. And the satiety that seises
us upon too long a Lecture, pro∣ceeds
from nothing but from the
weariness of our Spirits, and con∣sequently
from the cessation or the
decay of those two pleasing Pas∣sions.
But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Poetry attains its final
end, which is the reforming the
Minds of Men, by exciting of Passi∣on.
And here I dare be bold to af∣firm,
that all Instruction whatever,
depends upon Passion. The Moral
Philosophers themselves, even the
dryest of them, can never instruct
and reform, unless they move; for
either they make Vice odious and
Vertue lovely, or they deter you
from one by the Apprehension of Mi∣sery,
or they incite you to the other,
by the Happiness they make you ex∣pect
from it; or they work upon
your Shame, or upon your Pride, or
upon your Indignation. And there∣fore
Poetry instructs and reforms
more powerfully than Philosophy
can do, because it moves more pow∣erfully:
And therefore it instructs
<PB N="12" REF="57"/>
more easily too. For whereas all Men
have Passions, and great Passions of
one sort or another, and whereas
those Passions will be employed, and
whatever way they move, they that
way draw the Man, it follows that
Philosophy can instruct but hardly,
because it moves but gently; for the
violent Passions not finding their Ac∣count
in those faint emotions, begin
to rebel and fly to their old Objects,
whereas Poetry at the same time that
it instructs us powerfully, must re∣form
us easily; because it makes the
very Violence of the Passions contri∣bute
to our Reformation: For the
generality of Mankind are apparent∣ly
swayed by their Passions, nay, and
perhaps the very best and wisest of
them. The greatest Philosophers
and the greatest Princes are influ∣enced
by their Favourites, and so are
the wisest Magistrates. And 'tis for
this reason that not only the Devil,
who must be suppos'd to understand
human nature, corrupts Mankind
by their Passions; (for Temptation
is nothing but the inclining Men to
such and such Actions, by the rais∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="58"/>
such and such Passions in them)
but God himself, who made the Soul,
and best understands its nature, con∣verts
it by its Passions: For whereas
Philosophy pretends to correct hu∣man
Passions by human Reason, that
is, things that are strong and ungo∣vernable,
by something that is feeble
and weak, Poetry by the force of the
Passion, instructs and reforms the
Reason; which is the Design of the
true Religion, as we have shewn in
another place. So that we have here
already laid down one great Rule,
necessary for the succeeding in Poetry:
For since it can attain neither
its subordinate nor its final End,
without exciting of Passion, it fol∣lows,
that where there is nothing
which directly tends to the moving
of that, there can be no Poetry; and
that consequently, a Poet ought to
contrive every thing in order to the
moving of Passion, that not only the
Fable, the Incidents and Characters,
but the very Sentiments and the Ex∣pressions,
ought all to be designed
for that: For since Poetry pleases
and instructs us more, even than
<PB N="14" REF="59"/>
Philosophy it self, only because it
moves us more, it follows, that the
more Poetry moves, the more it
pleases and instructs; and it is for
this reason that Tragedy, to those
who have a Tast of it, is both more
pleasing and more instructing, than
Comedy. And this naturally brings
us to the dividing Poetry into the
greater and the less.</P>
<P>1. The greater Poetry is an Art
by which a Poet justly and reason∣ably
excites great Passion, that he
may please and instruct, and com∣prehends
Epick, Tragick, and the
greater Lyrick Poetry.</P>
<P>2. The less Poetry is an Art by
which a Poet excites less Passion for
the forementioned Ends; and in∣cludes
in it, Comedy and Satyr, and
the little Ode, and Elegiack, and
Pastoral Poems. But first we shall
treat of the former.</P>

<P>THE greater Poetry then, is an
Art by which a Poet justly and
reasonably excites great Passion, in
order to please and instruct, and
make Mankind better and happier;
so that the first and grand Rule in
the greater Poetry is, that a Poet
must every where excite great Passi∣on;
but in some Branches of the
greater Poetry, it is impossible for a
Poet every where to excite in a very
great degree, that which we vul∣garly
call Passion: As in the Ode
for Example, and in the Narration
of the Epick Poem. It follows then
that there must be two sorts of Passi∣on.
<HI>First,</HI> That which we call Vul∣gar
Passion, and <HI>Secondly,</HI> Enthusiasm.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Vulgar Passion or that
which we commonly call Passion,
is that which is moved by the Ob∣jects
<PB N="16" REF="61"/>
themselves, or by the Idea's
in the ordinary course of Life,
I mean that common Society which
we find in the World. As for
Example, Anger is moved by an
Affront that is offered us in our
presence, or by the relation of one;
Pitty by the sight of a mournful
Object, or the relation of one;
Admiration or Wonder, (the com∣mon
Passion I mean, for there is
an Enthusiastick Admiration, as
we shall find anon) by the sight
of a strange Object, or the relati∣on
of one. But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Enthusiastick Passion or
Enthusiasm, is a Passion which is
moved by the Idea's in Contem∣plation
or the Meditation of Things,
that belong not to common Life:
Most of our Thoughts in Medita∣tion,
are naturally attended with
some sort and some degree of Pas∣sion,
and this Passion if it is strong
I call Enthusiasm: Now, the En∣thusiastick
Passions are chiefly Six,
Admiration, Terror, Horror, Joy,
Sadness, Desire, caused by Idea's
occuring to us in Meditation, and
<PB N="17" REF="62"/>
producing the same Passions that the
Objects of those Idea's would raise
in us, if they were set before us
in the same Light that those Idea's
give us of them. And here I de∣sire
the Reader to observe, that
Idea's in Meditation, are often ve∣ry
different from what Idea's of
the same Objects are, in the course
of common Conversation. As for
Example, the Sun mention'd in or∣dinary
Conversation, gives the Idea
of a round flat shining Body, of
about Two Foot Diameter. But
the Sun occurring to us in Me∣ditation,
gives the Idea of a∣vast
and glorious Body, and the
top of all the visible Creation, and
the brightest material Image of the
Divinity. I leave the Reader there∣fore
to judge, if this Idea must
not necessarily be attended with
Admiration, and that Admiration
I call Enthusiasm. So Thunder men∣tion'd
in common Conversation,
gives an Idea of a black Cloud,
and a great Noise, which makes
no great Impression upon us. But
the Idea of it occurring in Medi∣tation,
<PB N="18" REF="63"/>
sets before us the most for∣cible,
most resistless, and conse∣quently
the most dreadful Phaeno∣menon
in Nature: So that this I∣dea
must move a great deal of
Terror in us, and 'tis this sort of
Terror that I call Enthusiasm.
And 'tis this sort of Terror, or Ad∣miration,
or Horror, and so of the
rest, which exprest in Poetry,
make that Spirit, that Passion, and
that Fire which so wonderfully
please.</P>
<P>Thus there are two sorts of
Passions to be rais'd in Poetry, the
Vulgar and the Enthusiastick, to
which last, the Vulgar is prefera∣ble,
because all Men are capable
of being moved by the Vulgar,
and a Poet writes to all: But the
Enthusiastick are more subtle, and
Thousands have no feeling and no
notion of them; but where the
Vulgar cannot be moved in a great
degree, there the Enthusiastick are
to be rais'd. Therefore in those
parts of Epick Poetry, where the
Poet speaks himself, or the Eldest
of the Muses for him, the Enthu∣siastick
<PB N="19" REF="64"/>
Passions are to prevail, as
likewise in the greater Ode. And
the Vulgar Passions are to prevail
in those parts of an Epick and
Dramatick Poem, where the Poet
introduces Persons holding Conver∣sation
together. And perhaps this
might be one Reason, for which
<HI>Aristotle</HI> might prefer Tragedy to
Epick Poetry, because the Vulgar
Passions prevail more in it, and
are more violently mov'd in it,
and therefore Tragedy must ne∣cessarily
both please, and instruct
more generally than Epick Poetry.
We shall then treat of the Vulgar
Passions when we come to speak
of Tragedy, in which Poem they
ought most to prevail; We shall
then more particularly shew the
surest and most powerful ways of
raising Compassion and Terror,
which are the true Tragical Pas∣sions.</P>
<P>We shall at present treat of the
Enthusiastick Passions, and how
they are to be rais'd. We have
taken notice above that they are
to be mov'd by Idea's occurring
<PB N="20" REF="65"/>
in Contemplation, that they are to
be mov'd in a great degree, and
yet justly and reasonably. We shall
now shew that the strongest En∣thusiastick
Passions, that are justly
and reasonably rais'd, must be rais'd
by religious Idea's, that is, by Idea's
which either shew the attributes of
the Divinity, or relate to his Wor∣ship.
And this we shall endea∣vour
to prove, <HI>1st.</HI> by Reason;
<HI>2ly.</HI> by Authority; <HI>3ly.</HI> by Ex∣amples.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We shall endeavour to
prove it by Reason. Since the fore∣said
Passions are to be moved in
a great Degree, and are to be
moved by their Idea's, it follows,
That to be justly and reasonably
moved, they must be moved by
great Idea's. And therefore the
stronger the Enthusiasm is, the
greater must the Idea's be. Now
those Idea's are certainly the grea∣test,
which are worthiest to move
the greatest and the wisest Men:
For there the Enthusiastick Passions
in Poetry are truly admirable, when
<PB N="21" REF="66"/>
the greater and more violent they
are, the more they show the large∣ness
of Soul, and greatness of Ca∣pacity
of the Writer. For Men
are moved for Two Reasons, either
because they have weak Minds and
Souls, that are capable of being
moved by little Objects, and con∣sequently
by little and ordinary
Idea's; or because they have great∣ness
of Soul and Capacity, to dis∣cern
and feel the great ones; for
the Enthusiastick Passions being
caus'd by the Idea's, it follows,
That the more the Soul is capable
of receiving Idea's whose Objects
are truly great and wonderful, the
greater will the Enthusiasm be that
is caus'd by those Idea's; From
whence it follows, that the greater
the Soul is, and the larger the Ca∣pacity,
the more will it be moved
by religious Idea's; which are not
only great and wonderful, but which
almost alone are great and won∣derful
to a great and wise Man;
and which never fail to move ve∣ry
strongly, unless it is for want
of due Reflection, or want of Ca∣pacity
in the Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="67"/>
Since therefore the Enthusiasm
in the greater Poetry, is to hold
Proportion with the Idea's, and
those Idea's are certainly the great∣est,
which are worthiest to move
the greatest and the wisest Men;
and Divine Idea's or Idea's which
shew the Attributes of God, or re∣late
to his Worship, are worthiest
to move the greatest and the wi∣sest
Men; because such Idea's be∣long
to Objects which are only
truly above them, and consequent∣ly
truly Admirable, Desirable, Joy∣ful,
Terrible, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it follows, That
the greatest and strongest Enthusi∣asm
that can be imploy'd in Poetry,
is only justly and reasonably to be
derived from Religious Idea's.</P>
<P>But here we desire the Reader's
leave to make this Observation,
That since Religious and Divine
Idea's, or Idea's which shew the
Attributes, or relate to the Wor∣ship
of the Divinity, are the wor∣thiest
to move the greatest and the
wisest Men; and the greater and wiser
the Men are, the more they must
move and raise them: As for Ex∣ample,
<PB N="23" REF="68"/>
The greater and more com∣prehensive
the Soul is, which re∣flects
upon the Idea of God, the
more that Idea must fill that Soul
with Admiration; it follows, That
as great Passion, only is the ade∣quate
Language of the greater Po∣etry;
so the greater Poetry, is on∣ly
the adequate Language of Reli∣gion;
and that therefore the great∣est
Passion, is the Language of that
sort of Poetry; because that sort
of Poetry is the worthiest Language
of Religion.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> We shall proceed
to prove by Authority, That the
strongest Enthusiastick Passions in
Poetry, are only justly and reason∣ably
to be rais'd by Religious I∣dea's:
And this we shall show by
the Authority of the greatest Cri∣ticks
among the Antients, <HI>Aristotle,
Hermogenes,</HI> and <HI>Longinus.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>Aristotle</HI> says, in the third
Book of his Rhetorick, <HI>Cap.</HI> II. and
III. That the frequent use of Me∣taphors,
Dialects, Epithets, is a
great deal fitter for Poetry than it
<PB N="24" REF="69"/>
is for Prose, because they are the
Language of Passion, and Poetry
is more Passionate or more Enthu∣siastick
than Prose, for this Reason,
because the Persons and the Things
of which Poetry treats, are many
degrees above those which are the
Subjects of Prose. Now all the
World knows that the Graecians,
treated of the greatest Human Per∣sons
and Things in their Prose, but
that Poetry was a Language which
they reserv'd for their Gods, and for
the Things which related to them.
And I am apt to believe, that Po∣etry
from hence was called, the
Language of the Gods, because when
ever the Graecians in the Poetical
times, introduc'd their God's Speak∣ing,
they were sure to speak in
Verse. But</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Hermogenes,</HI> in the VI.
Chapter of the First Book of his
Treatise, concerning the Forms of
Speech, tells us, That there are
Four kind of Thoughts or Idea's,
or Conceptions, which were proper
to give that elevation and gravity
to a Discourse, which by their uni∣on
<PB N="25" REF="70"/>
compose that quality in Wri∣ting
which we call Majesty.</P>
<P>1. The First and Principal of them
are, all such Thoughts or Idea's of
God, as are worthy of the Divi∣nity,
not like some of the Home∣rical
Conceptions of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which
says <HI>Hermogenes,</HI> being more Hu∣man
than Divine, and unworthy of
the Divinity, are contrary to true
Majesty.</P>
<P>2. Next to these the Concep∣tions
which give Elevation and
Gravity, and consequently Majesty
to a Discourse, are such Thoughts
or Idea's concerning the Works of
God, as are worthy the Divine
Workmanship.</P>
<P>3. The Third sort of Conceptions
are, of such Things as are indeed
themselves Divine, but they are
such Emanations of Divinity, as
are to be seen in Men, as Justice,
Temperance, Fortitude, Nature,
Law and the like, to which may
be added, Number, Power and
Might.</P>
<P>4. The Fourth sort are, of Things
that indeed are Human, but are
<PB N="26" REF="71"/>
reputed Great and Illustrious, as,
Conquest, Riches, Nobility, Place,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But here I desire the Reader
to observe, That <HI>Hermogenes</HI> is here
speaking concerning Peices of Elo∣quence,
and such Discourses as are
writ in Prose; for it is certain,
that these last Idea's as they are
of Things that are meerly Human,
can never afford the greatest Spirit
that can be imploy'd in Poetry.
For as the Objects themselves are
not truly great, because, as <HI>Longinuus</HI>
says, A Man who has it in his
Power to possess them, shows him∣self
Great by contemning them:
It is impossible that a Spirit that is
very great, can flow from these
Idea's, because the Spirit that is
very great, must hold proportion
with its Idea's, as the Idea's must
with their Objects; and therefore
these Idea's cannot be great, because
their Objects are not great. We
ought now in the <HI>Third</HI> Place, to
proceed to the Authority of <HI>Longi∣nus.</HI>
But that we may Diversifie
this Treatise the more, and make
it the more entertaining, we shall
<PB N="27" REF="72"/>
first shew Examples of the several
kinds of the foremention'd Thoughts,
producing that sort of Spirit in Po∣etry
which we call Enthusiastick
Admiration, and that we may show
the Reader more plainly how that
Spirit is produc'd, we shall set be∣fore
him as near as we can, such
kind of Thoughts as inspire the
Soul with Admiration alone, un∣complicated
with Terror, or any
other Passion.</P>
<P>These Thoughts, or Idea's, which
produce that Enthusiasm which we
call Admiration, are Thoughts or
Idea's which hold some proportion
with such Objects, as in their Na∣ture
are truly admirable. Those
Thoughts or Idea's are of Two
sorts, Idea's of Sounds, and Idea's
of Things. We shall then have
occasion to treat of Idea's of Sounds,
when we come to speak of Ter∣rour,
and some of the other En∣thusiastick
Passions; we shall at
present treat of such Idea's of
Things,, as are proper to excite
Admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="73"/>
We have shown that <HI>Hermoge∣nes</HI>
in the first Rank of these,
reckons those Thoughts and Idea's
of God, that are worthy of the
Creator: Such is the Invocation of
<HI>Milton,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Para∣dise
Lost.</HI></P>
<Q><L>And chiefly Thou, O Spirit! that dost prefer</L>
<L>Before all Temples, th' upright Heart and pure,</L>
<L>Instruct me, for Thou know'st, Thou from the first</L>
<L>Wast present, and with Mighty Wings o'erspread,</L>
<L>Dove-like Sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss:</L>
<L>And mad'st it pregnant what in me is Dark,</L>
<L>Illumin, what is Low raise and support,</L>
<L>That to the Height of this great Argument</L>
<L>I may assert, Eternal Providence;</L>
<L>And justifie the Ways of God to Men.</L></Q>
<P>And that it was these Divine
Idea's, that rais'd his Soul and fill'd
it with Admiration, and with a
noble Greatness, which Passion ex∣prest,
makes the greatness of the
<PB N="29" REF="74"/>
Spirit, the Reader who goes back
to the beginning of the Poem, will
find no manner of room to doubt.
For <HI>Milton,</HI> like a Master, begins
with a gentle Spirit, which he con∣tinues
for the Twelve first Lines:
In the Thirteenth where he speaks
of the boldness of his Attempt, he
begins to rise; and in the Nineteenth,
where he talks of the Power of the
Holy Ghost, he is quite upon the
Wing.</P>
<Q><L>Instruct me, for Thou know'st, Thou from the first.</L></Q>
<P>And such are the Thoughts con∣cerning
God, which are spread thro'
that Divine Dialogue, between God
and <HI>Adam,</HI> in the Eighth Book of
the same Poem; I believe the
Reader, will pardon the length if
I repeat it, which I am very much
inclin'd to do, not only because I
challenge the most zealous admirers
of Antiquity, to produce any thing
like it, from among all the Dia∣logues
in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> that are
between either a God or a Man, or
between one God and another:
<PB N="30" REF="75"/>
But because the Reader who sees
the inequalities in it, will easily
see that it derives its greatness and
its sublimity, from the becoming
Thoughts which it has of the Dei∣ty.
That the Reader may through∣ly
understand it, without turning
to the Book, the occasion of it is
this. <HI>Adam,</HI> relating the History
of the Creation to the Angel <HI>Ra∣phael,</HI>
tells him, how after he had
given Names to the Birds and the
Beasts, which God had brought
before him for that purpose; he
who understood their Natures, and
saw none of them was fit for his
Conversation, desir'd of God in the
following Words, a Partner fit for
Humane Society.</P>
<Q><L>O by what Name, for Thou above all these,</L>
<L>Above Mankind, or ought than Mankind higher</L>
<L>Surpassest far my Naming, how may I</L>
<L>Adore Thee? Author of this Universe,</L>
<L>And all this good to Man, for whose well being</L>
<L>So amply, and with Hands so liberal</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="76"/>
Thou hast provided all things. But with me</L>
<L>I see not who partakes; In Solitude</L>
<L>What Happiness? Who can Injoy alone?</L>
<L>Or all Injoying what Contentment find?</L>
<L>Thus I presumptuous; And the Vision bright</L>
<L>As with a Smile more brightned, thus reply'd.</L></Q>
<P>Here by the way, I desire the
Reader to observe, how the Spirit
of the Poem sinks, when <HI>Adam</HI>
comes from God, to himself; and
how it rises again, when he returns
to his Creator: But let us proceed
to God's reply.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>What call'st thou Solitude? Is not the Earth</L>
<L>With various living Creatures, and the Air</L>
<L>Replenisht; and all these at thy Command</L>
<L>To come and Play before thee? Know'st thou not</L>
<L>Their Language and their Ways? They also know</L>
<L>And reason not contemptibly; with these</L>
<L>Find Pastime, and bear Rule, thy Realm is large.</L>
<L>So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="77"/>
So Ordering: I with leave of Speech implor'd,</L>
<L>And humble deprecation, thus reply'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not my Words offend Thee, Heavenly Power<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>My Maker be propitious while I speak:</L>
<L>Hast not thou made me here thy Substitute,</L>
<L>And these inferiour far, beneath me set?</L>
<L>Among Unequals what Society</L>
<L>Can sort? What Harmony or true Delight,</L>
<L>Which must be mutual in proportion due,</L>
<L>Given and receiv'd; but in disparity</L>
<L>The one intense, the other still remiss,</L>
<L>Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove</L>
<L>Tedious alike; of fellowship I speak,</L>
<L>Such as I seek Fit to participate</L>
<L>All rational Delight; wherein the Brute</L>
<L>Cannot be humane Consort: They rejoice</L>
<L>Each with their Kind, Lion with Lioness;</L>
<L>So fitly them in Pairs thou hast combin'd:</L>
<L>Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowl</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="78"/>
So well converse; nor with the Ox the Ape;</L>
<L>Worse then can Man with Beast and least of All.</L>
<L>Whereto the Almighty answer'd not displeas'd,</L>
<L>A nice and subtle Happiness, I see</L>
<L>Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice</L>
<L>Of thy Associates, <HI>Adam,</HI> and wilt taste</L>
<L>No Pleasure, though in pleasure Solitary:</L>
<L>What think'st thou then of Me, and this my State,</L>
<L>Seem I to thee sufficiently possest</L>
<L>Of Happiness or not, who am alone</L>
<L>From all Eternity? For none I know</L>
<L>Second to Me, or like, Equal much less:</L>
<L>How have I then, with whom to hold converse</L>
<L>Save with the Creatures which I made, and those</L>
<L>To Me Inferior infinite descents</L>
<L>Beneath what other Creatures are to thee.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>The Reader may easily see, that
here is all that is great and su∣blime
in Reason, exprest with the
Spirit of that just Admiration, with
which such worthy Thoughts of the
<PB N="34" REF="79"/>
Deity must naturally fill the Soul.
But now let us see <HI>Adam</HI>'s An∣swer.</P>
<Q><L>He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd, To attain</L>
<L>The height and depth of thy Eternal Ways,</L>
<L>All Humane Thoughts come short, Supream of Things▪</L>
<L>Thou in thy Self art perfect; and in Thee</L>
<L>Is no deficience found; not so is Man</L>
<L>But in degree, the Cause of his desire</L>
<L>By Conversation with his Like to help</L>
<L>Or solace his defects: No need that Thou</L>
<L>Shouldst propagate already Infinite,</L>
<L>And through all Numbers absolute tho' One</L>
<L>But Man by Number is to manifest</L>
<L>His single Imperfection, and beget</L>
<L>Like of his Like, his Image multiplied.</L>
<L>In Unity defective, which requires</L>
<L>Collateral Love and dearest Amity:</L>
<L>Thou in thy Secresy altho' alone,</L>
<L>Best with thy Self accompanied, seekst not</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="80"/>
Social Communication; yet so pleas'd,</L>
<L>Canst raise thy Creature to what height thou wilt,</L>
<L>Of Union, or Communion DeiFi'd:</L>
<L>I by Conversing cannot these Erect</L>
<L>From Prone, nor in their ways complaisence find.</L></Q>
<P>What <HI>Milton</HI> saith of the Son of
God Hymn'd by the Angels, in the
Third Book of that Poem, is very
Lofty and Elevated.</P>
<Q><L>Thee next they sang, of All Creation First</L>
<L>Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,</L>
<L>In whose conspicuous Countenance, without Cloud</L>
<L>Made visible, the Almighty Father shines:</L>
<L>Whom else no Creature can Behold, on Thee</L>
<L>Imprest th' Effulgence of his Glory abides:</L>
<L>Tranfus'd in Thee his ample Spirit rests,</L>
<L>He Heaven of Heavens, and all the Powers therein,</L>
<L>By Thee created, and by Thee threw down</L>
<L>Th' aspiring Dominations, Thou that Day</L>
<L>Thy Father's dreadful Thunder didst not spare,</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="81"/>
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot Wheels that shook</L>
<L>Heaven's everlasting Frame, while o'er the Necks</L>
<L>Thou drov'st of Warring Angels dis-array'd.</L></Q>
<P>I have the rather mention'd these
Verses, to show that <HI>Milton</HI> was
a little tainted with Socinianism, for
by the first Verse 'tis evident, that
he look't upon the Son of God as
a Created Being. The last Thing
that I shall mention is, what God
says of Himself, in the Seventh
Book, for speaking of Chaos, he
says, that is boundless because He
is infinite.</P>
<Q><L>Boundless the deep, because I Am who fill</L>
<L>Infinitude, nor vacuous the space,</L>
<L>Tho' I uncircumscrib'd my self retire,</L>
<L>And put not forth My Goodnese, which is free</L>
<L>To Act or not; Necessity and Chance</L>
<L>Approach not Me, and what I Will is Fate.</L></Q>
<P>I could add an infinite number
of Examples, if it were not alto∣gether
<PB N="37" REF="82"/>
needless, for what has been
said, may suffice to show that a Poet
who intends: to give that Elevation,
and that Gravity to his Poem;
which Compose Majesty can fetch
his Ideas from no Object so proper
as from God. For as great Elevation
must be produced by a great Admi∣ration,
as every Passion which the
Poet excites, ought to be just and
Reasonable, and Adapted to its Ob∣ject,
it is impossible that any one,
who is not stupid, can seriously con∣template
his Maker, but that his
Soul must be exalted and lifted up
towards its Primitive Objects, and be
fill'd and inspired with the highest
Admiration. For 'tis then that the
Enthusiasm in Poetry is Wonderful
and Divine, when it shows the Ex∣cellence
of the Authors discernment,
and the largeness of his Soul; now
all the Ideas of God are such, that
the more large and comprehensive
the Soul of a Poet is; and the more
it is capable of Receiving those Idea's
the more is it sure to be raised and
fill'd and lifted to the Skies with won∣der;
The Spirit or the Passion in
<PB N="38" REF="83"/>
Poetry ought to be proportioned to
the Ideas, and the Ideas to the Ob∣ject,
and when it is not so it is ut∣terly
false. And therefore when ever
in Poetry there is a great Spirit
which is derived from Ideas, whose
Objects are unworthy to move the
Soul of a great and a wise Man,
there that Spirit is either false
or at least has nothing sublimely,
admirable in it. But nothing but
God, and what relates to God,
is worthy to move the Soul of a
great and a wise Man. But let us
proceed to consider the glorious
works of the Creator, which next to
Himself are worthy to move with
Admiration, all who are worthy to be
called wise, because these when they
are reflected upon, by the Great and
the Wise, never fail to declare his
Eternal Power and Godhead. Our
Religion tells us that the first,
the Greatest and most Glorious of
His works are the Angels, who whe∣ther
we consider their Power, their
Swiftness, their Science, or their
Sanctity, are fit Objects of our Ad∣miration
and Consequently of Lofty
<PB N="39" REF="84"/>
and Elevated Poetry. Let us see
then how <HI>Tasso</HI> describes the Angel
<HI>Gabriel</HI> and his descent, in the first
Canto of the <HI>Hyerusalemme.</HI></P>

<P>Where the Reader may take no∣tice,
that the Comparison of the Sun,
to <HI>Michael</HI> the Prince of the Arch-Angels,
is extreamly Just and Noble,
because the top of the Visible, is
admirably liken'd to the top of
the invisible Creation: But in the

been guilty of an Anticlimax.

<P>Thus the Reader may see by what
has been said, that the Idea's of An∣gels
are exceeding proper to raise En∣thusiastick
Admiration, as being the
most glorious and Admirable Beings
of the Creation, and which lead the
Soul immediately to its Creator.
Next to these come the other Crea∣tures
of the Immaterial World as
Daemons, Apparitions of all sorts,
and more particularly the Spirits
of Men departed, then follow Pro∣phecies,
Visions, Miracles, Enchant∣ments,
Prodigies, and all things
which have an Immediate Relation
to the wonders <HI>of another</HI> World, of
most of which we shall give exam∣ples,
when we come to Speak of
Terror, because they are rather
wonderful, than they are Admirable.
We Name those things wonderful
which we Admire with fear.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="90"/>
The next Ideas that are most
proper to produce the Enthusiasm of
Admiration, are the great Phaeno∣mena
of the Material World; because
they too lead the Soul to its Maker,
and shew, as the Apostle says, his E∣ternal
Power and Godhead: As the
Heavens and Heavenly Bodies, the
Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and the
immensity of the Universe, and the
Motions of the Heaven and Earth.
Witness what <HI>Milton</HI> says, of the Sun
when he describes the descent of Sa∣tan
from Heaven Gates to Paradise
Lib. 3.</P>
<Q><L>above them all</L>
<L>The golden Sun in Splendor likest Heaven</L>

<L>Thro' the calm Firmament, but up or down</L>
<L>By center or eccentrick, hard to tell</L>
<L>Or longitude, where the great Luminary</L>
<L>Aloof the vulgar Constellations thick</L>
<L>That from his Lordly Eye keep distance due</L>
<L>Dispences Light from far, they as they move</L>

<L>The Universe.</L></Q>
<P>But to show how very much
these fall short of the Immaterial
Creation, a Poet that he may make
them more Admirable contrives to
give Spirit and Soul to them.</P>
<L>Where the great Luminarie</L>
<L>Aloof, the Vulgar Constellations thick,</L>
<L>That from his Lordly eye keep distance due</L>
<L>Dispences light from far.</L>
<P>And in that Noble Apostrophe to

<L>What we, not to explore the Secrets, ask,</L>

<L>And longer will delay to hear thee tell</L>

<P>For the Stars and the immensity
of the Universe, I desire the Rea∣der
would give me leave to bring
an Example, from the Paraphrase
upon the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> where thus the
Angel speaks to God.</P>
<Q><L>Where e'er at utmost stretch we cast our Eyes,</L>
<L>Thro' the vast frightful Spaces of the Skies,</L>
<L>Ev'n there we find Thy Glory, there we gaze</L>
<L>On Thy bright Majesty's unbounded Blaze,</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="94"/>
On Thy bright Majesty's unbounded Blaze,</L>
<L>Ten Thousand Suns prodigious Globes of Light,</L>
<L>At once in broad dimensions strike our Sight;</L>
<L>Millions behind in the remoter Skies,</L>
<L>Appear but Spangles to our wearied Eyes:</L>
<L>And when our wearied Eyes want farther strength,</L>
<L>To pierce the Void's immeasurable Length,</L>
<L>Our vigorous towring Thoughts still farther fly,</L>
<L>And still remoter Flaming Worlds descry:</L>
<L>But even an Angel's comprehensive Thought,</L>
<L>Cannot extend so far as thou hast wrought:</L>
<L>Our vast Conceptions are by swelling, brought,</L>
<L>Swallow'd and lost in Infinite, to naught.</L></Q>
<P>The Idea of the World's im∣mensity
is very proper to produce
Admiration, as leading us to the
Glory of the Creator, the use that
<HI>Milton</HI> makes of it, in the Eighth
Book of Paradise lost.</P>
<Q><L>And for the Heavens wide Circuit, let it speak</L>
<L>The Maker's high Magnificence, who Built</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="95"/>
So spacious, and his Line stretch't out so far,</L>
<L>That Man may know he dwells not in his own;</L>
<L>An Edifice too large for him to fill,</L>
<L>Lodg'd in a small Partition, and the rest</L>
<L>Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known.</L></Q>
<P>And <HI>Tasso</HI> finely makes use of that
Noble Idea, to repress the Pride
and Ambition of Man. 'Tis in

<P>The following Verses of <HI>Milton,</HI>
in the Eighth of Paradise Lost,
concerning the Magnitude and the
Motions of the Heavens and Earth
<PB N="52" REF="97"/>
derive a Lofty Spirit from their
Subject for there says <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<Q><L>When I behold this goodly Frame, this World,</L>
<L>Of Heaven and Earth consisting, and compute</L>
<L>Their magnitudes, this Earth a Spot, a Grain,</L>
<L>An Atom with the Firmament compar'd,</L>
<L>And all her numbred Stars, that seem to roll</L>
<L>Spaces incomprehensible (for such</L>
<L>Their distance argues, and their swift return</L>
<L>Diurnal)</L></Q>
<P>I could here bring Examples of
the same kind of Spirit, derived in
due Proportion from Ideas of Sub∣lunary
Things, as of the Four Ele∣ments
Water, Earth, Air, Fire,
Winds and Meteors of all sorts,
Seas, Rivers, Mountains, but I am
afraid of running into Length, and
heaping too many Citations one
upon another. Besides it will be
very convenient to make two or
three Remarks here.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="98"/>
<HI>First,</HI> That the Wonders of the
Universe, afford the more admira∣ble
Ideas and a more admirable
Spirit, the more they shew the
attributes of the Creator or relate
to his Worship. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
Na ural Philosophy is absolutely
necessary to a Poet, not only that
he may adorn his Poem, with the
useful knowledge it affords, but
because the more he knows the
immense Phaenomena of the Uni∣verse,
the more he will be sure to
admire them. For the more we
know of Things that are never to
be comprehended by us, the more
that knowledge must make them
appear wonderful. The <HI>Third</HI> Re∣mark
that I shall make is this,
That they to whom Nature has
given that happy Elevation of
Thought, which alone can make
a great Poet, will often be di∣rected
by that tendency to great∣ness,
which they have within them
to Ideas, from which they may
derive a lofty Spirit, yet I shall
shew by the Example of <HI>Milton,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="99"/>
that they may often very grosly
fail, for want of a certain know∣ledge
of the Objects from which
they are to draw their Idea's, for
'tis for want of that knowledge
that <HI>Milton</HI> has done the most un∣artful
thing that perhaps ever was
done, in the two or three last Books
of the greatest Poem that ever was
written by Man. For whereas in
the First Eight Books, he had by
the Mouth of God or Angels, or of
Man the Companion of Angels,
divinely entertain'd us with the
wondrous Works of God, in the
latter end of his Poem, and more
particularly in the last Book, he
makes an Angel entertain us with
the Works of corrupted Man, from
which it is very plain by what
has been deliver'd above, concern∣ing
the Nature of Enthusiastick
Passion; that that Angel could draw
no sort of Enthusiasm, and least of
all that of Admiration and Terror,
which give the principal Greatness
and Elevation to, Poetry. For how
flat, how low and unmusical is the Re∣lation
of the Actions of fall'n Man, in
<PB N="55" REF="100"/>
the 10th. <HI>Lib.</HI> tho' deliver'd by the
voice of Divinity.</P>
<Q><L>On <HI>Adam,</HI> Last thus judgment He pronounc'd,</L>
<L>Because thou hast hearkned to the Voice of thy Wife,</L>
<L>And eaten of the Tree, concerning which</L>
<L>I charg'd thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof,</L>
<L>Curs'd is the Ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow</L>
<L>Shalt eat thereof all the days of thy Life:</L>
<L>Thorns also, and Thistles it shall bring thee forth</L>
<L>Untill'd, and thou shalt eat the Herb of the Field:</L>
<L>In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread,</L>
<L>Till thou return unto the Ground, for thou</L>
<L>Out of the Ground wast taken; know thy Birth,</L>
<L>For Dust, thou art, and shalt to Dust return.</L></Q>
<P>The Late Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> with a
great deal of Injustice, us'd to at∣tribute
the flatness of <HI>Milton,</HI> in this
and some other Passages, to his
getting into a tract of Scripture, as
he was pleas'd to express himself:
Whereas the thing that made him
<PB N="56" REF="101"/>
sink, was plainly the poorness and
lowness of the Ideas. For how
could the Works of corrupted Man,
afford any other to God or Angels?
But what lofty what glorious Ideas
does a religious mention of the
Works of God, afford to Man in
his primitive State in that in∣comparable
Hymn in the Fifth
Book of the same Paradise Lost:
A Hymn, which tho' it is intirely
taken from Scripture, for it is ap∣parently
the 148 <HI>Psalm,</HI> yet will al∣ways
stand alone, the Phoenix of
Lofty Hymns, and nothing equal to
it, no nor Second to it can ever be
produced from the Grecian Writers
of Hymns. It is impossible I can
do a greater Pleasure to the Rea∣der,
who either has not read or
do's not remember <HI>Milton,</HI> than to
insert it here.</P>
<L>These are thy glorious Works, Parent of good</L>
<Q><L>Almighty, Thine this Universal Frame,</L>
<L>Thus wondrous fair, Thy Self how wondrous then,</L>
<L>Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens,</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="102"/>
To us invisible, or dimly seen</L>
<L>In these thy lowest Works; yet these declare</L>
<L>Thy goodness beyond Thought, and power Divine:</L>

<L>Angels, for ye behold Him, and with Songs</L>
<L>And Chorall Symphonies, Day without Night</L>
<L>Circle His Throne rejoicing, ye in Heaven</L>

<L>With thy bright Circlet, praise Him in thy Sphere,</L>
<L>While Day arises that Sweet Hour of Prime:</L>

<L>Acknowledge Him thy Greater, sound His praise</L>
<L>In thy eternal Course, both when thou climb'st</L>
<L>And When high-Noon hast gained, and when thou fall'st:</L>

<L>And ye Five other wand'ring Fires, that move</L>

<L>His Praise who out of Darkness call'd up Light:</L>

<L>Perpetual Circle multiform, and mix</L>
<L>And nourish all things, let your ceasless Change</L>

<L>Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise</L>
<L>From Hill or Steaming Lake, dusky or gray,</L>
<L>Till the Sun paint your Fleecy Skirts with Gold,</L>
<L>In honour to the World's great Author rise,</L>
<L>Whether to deck with Clouds th' uncolour'd Skie,</L>
<L>Or wet the thirsty Earth with falling Showers;</L>
<L>Rising or falling still advance his Praise:</L>
<L>His Praise ye Winds that from Four Quarters blow,</L>
<L>Breath soft or loud, and wave your tops ye Pines</L>
<L>With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave:</L>
<L>Fountains, and ye that warble as ye flow</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="104"/>
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune His Praise:</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oin Voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds</L>
<L>That Singing up to Heaven Gates ascend;</L>
<L>Bear on your Wings, and in your Notes His Praise:</L>
<L>Ye that in Waters glide, and ye that walk</L>
<L>The Earth and stately tread, or lowly creep,</L>
<L>Witness if I be silent Morn or Even,</L>
<L>To Hill or Valley, Fountain or fresh Shades;</L>
<L>Made Vocal by my Song, and taught His Praise:</L>
<L>Hail Universal Lord, be bounteous still,</L>
<L>To give us only Good, and if the Night</L>
<L>Have gather'd ought of Evil or conceal'd,</L>
<L>Disperse it, as now Light dispels the Dark.</L></Q>
<P>'Tis easie to discern here, with
how much more Divinity <HI>Milton</HI>
makes a Man speak concerning the
Works of God, than he makes even
the Creator Himself speak concern∣ing
the Works of Man. But here
if the Reader will pardon a Digres∣sion,
I shall make an Observation
which may not be disagreeable to
<PB N="60" REF="105"/>
him. The Observation is this, That
all the Passages in Paradise Lost,
where God is introduc'd Speaking,
are flat to the reserve of those in
which he speaks of himself. Upon
enquiring into the Reason of it, I
found, That according to the Ac∣count
which I have given of Poeti∣cal
Enthusiasm, or of the Spirit of
Poetry, it is nothing but that Ad∣miration
and Terrour, and the rest
of those Enthusiastical Passions which
are produced by their proper Ideas,
and which are to hold Proportion
with their Ideas, as their Ideas, must
with their Objects. Now nothing
is more impossible than that God
should either Fear or Admire His
own Creatures. But where <HI>Milton</HI>
makes him speak concerning Him∣self,
or His Infinite Power, there
he makes him speak with a great
Spirit, as in that Passage of the
Sixth Book where He speaks to
His Son.</P>
<Q><L>Go then thou mightiest in thy Father's Might</L>
<L>Ascend My Chariot, guide the rapid Wheels,</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="106"/>
That shake Heaven's Basis, bring forth all my War,</L>
<L>My Bow and Thunder, My Almighty Arms.</L></Q>
<P>'Tis plain that here the Poet is
guilty of a Mistake, but indeed a
Mistake that is almost unavoida∣ble,
for 'tis the Admiration and
Terrour that make the Spirit in
the preceding Verses; and it is im∣possible
to conceive the Ideas with∣out
feeling the Passions; so that
<HI>Milton</HI> while he was rapt with
Admiration and moved with Ter∣rour
by the Ideas which he had
conceiv'd, shifts Persons insensibly,
and forgetting who speaks, expresses
himself with those Passions which
indeed are proper enough in the
Poet, but never can be so in the
Deity. For neither His Bow, nor
His Almighty Arms, His Thunder,
nor the rapid Wheels that Shake
Heavens basis, can be in the least
Admirable or Terrible to the Divi∣nity,
so that Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> is certain∣ly,
in the right in his Notes upon
his <HI>Davideis,</HI> where he tells us, that
<PB N="62" REF="107"/>
God is to be introduc'd speaking
simply. And this puts me in mind
of an extraordinary Argument of
Monsieur <HI>Paschal,</HI> proving the Di∣vinity
of our Saviour by the simpli∣city
of his Stile; for says he, our
Saviour speaks of the sublimest Sub∣jects,
even the glories of the King∣dom
of Heaven without being
moved at all, which shews that
he was really God; for suppose a
Peasant, says he, or an ordinary
Man shou'd be carried to the
Court of some Prince, as for Ex∣ample
the great Mogul, and there
be shewn all his Riches, his Pomp
and his Power; this Peasant at his
return would certainly speak of
these Things in extravagant terms,
in terms that would sufficiently
declare his transport. But if the
Mogul himself was to speak of them,
he who had been always us;d to
them, would speak without any
emotion. So says Monsieur <HI>Paschal,</HI>
if any one else had deliver'd any
Thing concerning the glories of the
Kingdom of Heaven, he would cer∣tainly
have done it with transport,
<PB N="63" REF="108"/>
nay tho' he had been a Fanatick
or an Impostor; For let those Di∣vine
Ideas come how they will,
'tis Impossible for Man to think of
them without being Ravish'd by
them. But our Saviour who was
God, and who consequently had
been us'd to them from all Eternity,
spoke of them unconcern'd.</P>
<P>But let us come to the <HI>Third</HI>
sort of Thoughts, which <HI>Hermogenes</HI>
says, are proper to give Elevation
and Gravity to a Discourse, and
those are Things which indeed are
Divine, says, but are often beheld
in Men. These Emanations of
Divinity are the Virtues such as
Temperance, Justice, Fortitude,
Magnanimity; or Nature, Law,
Power and the like. And we
shou'd never make an end, if we
shou'd give Examples of all the
Passages, whose greatness of Spirit,
is deriv'd from these Ideas. But
for the Readers Entertainment we
shall mention a few.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="109"/>
The Power of Ruling our own
Minds, which may be referr'd to
Temperance, gives noble Ideas and
consequently a noble Spirit, as we
may see by the Second Ode, of the
Second Book of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Latius regnes avidum Domando</L>
<L>Spiritum, quam si Lybiam Remotis</L>
<L>Gadibus Jungas, &amp; uter{que} Paenus</L>
<L>serviat uni.</L></Q>
<P>Which in English is thus.</P>
<Q>

<L>Thou a more absolute Command shalt gain,</L>
<L>A larger nobler Empire shalt obtain,</L>
<L>If thy wild Lust of Pow'r thou canst restrain:</L>
<L>Than if to <HI>Spain</HI> thy Conquernig Troops shou'd joyn</L>
<L>The Moors that fry beneath the parching Line,</L>
<L>And both the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> should be thine.</L></Q>
<P>And the Idea of Fortitude affords
too a noble Spirit, as we may see in
the Twelfth of the <HI>Aeneis,</HI> where

<P>The <HI>Fourth</HI> sort of Thoughts
which <HI>Hermogenes</HI> mentions, as Ri∣ches,
Nobility, Place, Office, Rank,
and the like, we shall purposely
pass by, without giving Examples
of them, because we shall have
a particular occasion to do it here∣after.
Let us now pass to the next
Enthusiastick Passion which is Ter∣rour;
than which if it is rightly
manag'd, none is more capable of
giving a great Spirit to Poetry.
This Passion scarce ever goes by it∣self,
<PB N="69" REF="114"/>
but is always more or less
complicated with Admiration. For
every thing that is Terrible is great
at least to him to whom it is Ter∣rible.
'Tis now our business to shew
two Things. First, what this En∣thusiastick
Terrour is? and Second∣ly,
from what Ideas it is chiefly to
be deriv'd.</P>
<P>First let us show what this sort of
Enthusiasm is, and in order to that,
let us shew as briefly as we can,
what the Common Passion is
which we call Terror. Fear then
or Terror is, a Disturbance of Mind
proceeding from the apprehension
of an approaching evil; Threatning
Distruction or very great trouble
either to us or ours. And when
the disturbance comes suddenly
with surprise, let us call it Terror,
when gradually Fear. Things then
that are powerful, and likely to
hurt, are the causes of Common
Terror, and the more they are
powerful and likely to hurt, the
more they become the causes of
Terror, which Terror, the greater
it is, the more it is join'd with
<PB N="70" REF="115"/>
wonder, and the nearer it comes
to astonishment. Thus we have
shewn what Objects of the Mind
are the causes of Common Terror,
and the Ideas of those Objects are
the causes of Enthusiastick Terror.</P>
<P>Let us now shew from what
Ideas this Enthusiastick Terror is
chiefly to be deriv'd. The greatest
Enthusiastick Terrour then must
needs be deriv'd from Religious
Idea's, for since the more their Ob∣jects
are Powerful, and likely to
hurt, the greater Terrour their
Idea's produce: What can pro∣duce
a greater Terrour than the
Idea of an Angry God? Which puts
me in mind of that admirable Pas∣sage
of <HI>Homer,</HI> about the Fight of
the Gods, in the Twentieth of the
Iliads, cited by <HI>Longinus</HI> in his
Chapter of the Loftiness of the
Conceptions.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>I now come to the Precepts of
<HI>Longinus,</HI> and pretend to shew from
them, that the greatest sublimity is
to be deriv'd from Religious Ideas.
But why then, says the Reader, has
not <HI>Longinus</HI> plainly told us so? He
was not ignorant, that he ought to
make his subject as plain as he
could. For he has told us in the
beginning of his Treatise, that every
one who gives Instruction concer∣ning
<PB N="77" REF="122"/>
an Art, ought to endeavour
two things. The first is to make
his Reader clearly understand what
that is which he pretends to teach.
The second is to shew him how it
may be attain'd. And he blames
<HI>Cecilius</HI> very severely for neglect∣ing
the Last, how then says the
Objector comes he himself to have
taken no care of the First: Is it
because <HI>Cecilius</HI> had done it before
him? If so, it was a very great
fault in <HI>Longinus,</HI> to publish a Book
which cou'd not be understood but
by another Man's Writings; espe∣cially
when he saw that those Wri∣tings
were so very defective that
they would not probably last. But
what, continues the Objector, if
<HI>Cecilius</HI> had not done it before
him? For <HI>Longinus</HI> tells us that
<HI>Cecilius</HI> makes use of a multitude
of Words to shew what it is;
now he who knows any thing clear∣ly
may in a few Words explain it
clearly to others; and he who does
not will make it obscure by many.</P>
<P>To this I answer, that tho' <HI>Lon∣ginus</HI>
did by long Study, and habi∣tude
<PB N="78" REF="123"/>
know the Sublime when he
saw it, as well as any Man, yet
he had not so clear a knowledge of
the Nature of it as to explain it
clearly to others. For if he had
done that, as the Objector says,
he would have defin'd it, but he
has been so far from defining it,
that in one place he has given an
account of it that is contrary to
the true nature of it. For he tells
us in that Chapter which treats
of the Fountains of Sublimity, that
Loftiness is often without any Pas∣sion
at all. Which is contrary to
to the true nature of it. The sublime
is indeed often without Common Pas∣sion,
as ordinary Passion is often with∣out
that. But then it is never with∣out
Enthusiastick Passion. For the
Sublime is nothing else but a great
Thought, or Great Thoughts mo∣ving
the Soul from it's Ordinary
Scituation by the Enthusiasm which
naturally attends them. Now <HI>Lon∣ginus</HI>
had a notion of Enthusiastick
Passion; for he establishes it in that,
very Chapter for the second Source
of Sublimity. Now <HI>Longinus</HI> by
<PB N="79" REF="124"/>
affirming that the Sublime may be
without not only that, but ordina∣ry
Passion, says a thing that is not
only contrary to the true Nature
of it, but contradictory of Himself.
For he tells us in the beginning of
the Treatise that the Sublime does
not so properly persuade us, as it Ra∣vishes
and Transports us, and pro∣duces
in us a certain Admiration
mingled with astonishment and
with surprise, which is quite ano∣ther
thing than the barely Pleasing
or the barely perswading; that it
gives a noble Vigour to a Discourse,
an invincible force which commits a
pleasing Rape upon the very Soul
of the Reader; that whenever it
breaks out where it ought to do,
like the Artillery of <HI>Jove,</HI> it Thun∣ders
blazes and strikes at once,
and shews all the united force of a
Writer. Now I leave the Reader to
Judge, whether <HI>Longinius</HI> has not
been saying here all along that Subli∣mity
is never without Passion.</P>
<P>That the foremention'd Disini∣tion
is just and good, I have reason
to believe, because it takes in all
<PB N="80" REF="125"/>
the sources of Sublimity which <HI>Lon∣ginus</HI>
has establish'd. For first
greatness of Thought supposes Ele∣vation,
they, being Synonimous
Terms: And secondly the Enthusi∣asm
or the Pathetique, as <HI>Longinus</HI>
calls it, follows of course; for if a
Man is not strongly mov'd by great
Thoughts, he does not sufficiently
and effectually conceive them. And
thirdly the Figurative-Language is
but a consequence of the Enthusiasm,
that being the natural Language of
the Passions. And so is fourthly the
nobleness of the Expression, suppo∣sing
a Man to be Master of the
Language in which he Writes.
For as the Thoughts produce the
Spirit or the Passion, the Spirit
produces and makes the Expression,
which is known by experience to
all who are Poets; for never any
one, while he was rapt with Enthu∣siasm
or Ordinary Passion, wanted
either Words or Harmony, and is
self evident to all who consider
that the expression conveys and
shows the Spirit, and consequent∣ly
must be produc'd by it.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="126"/>
Thus the definition which we
have laid down, being according
to <HI>Longinus</HI> his own Doctrine, the
true definition of the Sublime, and
shewing clearly the thing which he
has not done, nor given any defini∣tion
at all of it, it seems plain to
me, that he had no clear and di∣stinct
Idea of it; and consequently
Religion might be the thing from
which it is chiefly to be deriv'd
and he but obscurely know it;
but that Religion is that thing
from which the Sublime is chiefly
to be deriv'd, let us shew by the
Marks which he has given of the
latter; which will further strengthen
our Definition. First, says he, that
which is truely sublime has this pe∣culiar
to it, that it exalts the
Soul and makes it conceive a grea∣ter
Idea of it self; filling it with
Joy, and with a certain noble Pride,
as if it self had produc'd what it but
barely Reads.</P>
<P>Now here it is plain, that the
highest Ideas must most exalt the
<PB N="82" REF="127"/>
Soul, but Religious Ideas are the
highest.</P>
<P>The more the Soul is mov'd by
the greatest Ideas, the more it
conceives them, but the more it
conceives of the greatest Ideas, the
greater Opinion it must have of its
own Capacity. By consequence the
more it is mov'd by the Wonders of
Religion the more it values it self
upon its own Excellences. Again,
The more the Soul sees its Excel∣lence
the more it Rejoyces. Besides
Religious Ideas are the most Ad∣mirable,
and what is most Admi∣rable
according to the Doctrine of
<HI>Aristrotle</HI> is most delightful. Besides
Religious Ideas create Passion in
such a manner as to turn and in∣cline
the Soul to its primitive Ob∣ject.
So that Reason and Passion
are of the same side, and this Peace
between the Faculties causes the
Soul to Rejoyce, of which we
shall have occasion to say more
anon.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="128"/>
2. The Second Mark that <HI>Lon∣ginus</HI>
gives of the Sublime, is when
a Discourse leaves a great deal for
us to think. But now this is cer∣tain
that the wonders of Religion
are never to be exhausted, for they
are always new, and the more you
enter into them, the more they are
sure to surprise.</P>
<P>3. The Third Mark is, when it
leaves in the Reader an Idea above
its Expression. Now no Expressi∣ons
can come up to the Ideas
which we draw from the Atri∣butes
of God, or from His won∣drous
Works, which only the Au∣thour
of them can comprehend.</P>
<P>4. The Fourth Mark is, when it
makes an impression upon us, which
it is impossible to resist.</P>
<P>God who made Man for Him∣self,
and for his own Glory, and
who requires chiefly his Heart; must
by consequence have form'd him
of such a Nature as to be most
<PB N="84" REF="129"/>
strongly mov'd with Religious Ide∣as
if once he enters into them.
So that the Impressions which they
make are Impossible to be Resisted.</P>
<P>5. The Fifth Mark is when the
Impression lasts and is difficult to
be defac'd. Now that the Im∣pressions
which Religion makes up∣on
us are difficult to be defac'd is
plain from this, that they who
think it their Interest to deface
them can never bring it about.</P>
<P>6. The Sixth Mark is when it
pleases universally, people of diffe∣rent
Humours, Inclinations, Sexes,
Ages, Times, Climates. Now there
is nothing so agreeable to the Soul
or that makes so universal an Im∣pression
as the wonders of Religion.
Some Persons are mov'd by Love
and are not touch'd by Ambition,
others are animated by Ambition
and only Laugh at Love. Some
are pleas'd with a brave Revenge,
others with a generous Contempt of
Injuries, but the Eternal Power and
<PB N="85" REF="130"/>
the Infinite knowledge of God, the
Wonders of the Creation, and the
beautiful brightness of Virtue make
a powerful impression on all.</P>
<P>I must confess I have wonder'd
very much upon Reflection, how it
could happen that so great a Man
as <HI>Longinus,</HI> who whenever he met
a passage in any Discourse that
was lofty enough to please him,
had discernment enough to see that
it had some of the preceeding Marks,
should miss of finding so easie a
thing as this, that never any passage
had all these Marks or so much as
the Majority of them, unless it
were Religious.</P>
<P>But to return to Terrour, we
may plainly see by the foregoing
Precepts and Examples of <HI>Longinus,</HI>
that this Enthusiastick Terror con∣tributes
extreamly to the Sublime,
and Secondly that it is most pro∣duced
by Religious Ideas.</P>
<P>First Ideas producing Terrour
contribute extreamly to the Sublime.
All the Examples that <HI>Longinus</HI>
brings of the loftiness of the
<PB N="86" REF="131"/>
Thought, consist of terrible Ideas.
And they are Principally such Ideas
that work the effects, which he
takes notice of, in the beginning of
his Treatise, <HI>viz.</HI> that Ravish and
Transport the Reader, and produce
a certain Admiration mingled with
Astonishment and with Surprize.
For the Ideas which produce Ter∣rour
are necessarily accompanied
with Admiration, because ev'ry
thing that is terrible is great to Him
to whom it is Terrible; and with
Surprize without which Terrour
cannot subsist; and with Astonish∣ment,
because ev'ry thing which is
very Terrible is Wonderful and
Astonishing; and as Terrour is
perhaps the violent'st of all the Passi∣ons,
it consequently makes an im∣pression
which we cannot resist, and
which is hardly to be defac'd, and
no Passion is attended with greater
Joy than Enthusiastick Terrour,
which proceeds from our reflecting
that we are out of Danger at the
very time that we see it before us.
And as Terrour is one of the vio∣lentest
<PB N="87" REF="132"/>
lentest of all Passions if it is very
great, and the hardest to be re∣sisted,
nothing gives more force, nor
more vehemence to a Discourse.
But Secondly, it is plain from the
same <HI>Longinus,</HI> that this Enthusia∣stick
Terrour is chiefly to be de∣riv'd
from Religious Ideas. For
all the Examples which he has
brought of the Sublime, in his
Chapter of the Sublimity of the
Thoughts consists of most Terrible
and most Religious Ideas, and at
the same time ev'ry Man's Reason
will inform him, that ev'ry thing
that is Terrible in Religion is the
most Terrible thing in the World.</P>
<P>But that we may set this in a
clearer Light, let us lay before the
Reader the several Ideas which
are capable of producing this En∣thusiastick
Terrour, which seem to
me to be those which follow, <HI>viz.</HI>
Gods, Daemons, Hell, Spirits and
Souls of Men, Miracles, Prodigies,
Enchantments, Witchcrafts, Thun∣der,
Tempests, raging Seas, Inun∣dations,
Torrents, Earthquakes,
<PB N="88" REF="133"/>
Volcanos, Monsters, Serpents, Li∣ons,
Tygres, Fire, War, Pestilence,
Famine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now of all these Ideas none are
so terrible as those which shew
the Wrath and Vengeance of an
Angry God. For nothing is so
wonderful in its effects, and conse∣quently
the Images or Ideas of those
effects must carry a great deal of
Terrour with them, which we
may see was <HI>Longinus</HI> his Opinion
by the Examples which he brings
in his Chapter of the Sublimity of
the Thoughts. Now of things which
are terrible those are the most terrible
which are the most wonderful, be∣cause
that seeing them both threat∣ning
and powerful, and not being
able to fathom the greatness and
extent of their Power, we know
not how far and how soon they
may hurt us.</P>
<P>But further nothing is so terri∣ble
as the wrath of infinite Power,
because nothing is so unavoidable
as the Vengeance design'd by it.
There is no flying nor lying hid
<PB N="89" REF="134"/>
from the great universal Monarch.
He may deliver us from all other
Terrours, but nothing can save
and defend us from him. And
therefore Reason which serves to
dissipate our Terrours in some other
Dangers, serves but to augment
them when we are threatned by
Infinite Power; and that Fortitude
which may be Heroick at other
times is down right madness then.</P>
<P>For the other Ideas which we
mention'd above, they will be
found to be more terrible as they
have more of Religion in them.
But we shall have so many neces∣sary
occasions of giving Examples
of them, in the Sequel of this
Treatise, that it will be altogether
needless to do it now. But here it
will be convenient to Answer an
Objection. For how come some
of the foremention'd Ideas which
seem to have but little to do with
Religion, to be Terrible to great
and to wise Men, as it is plain that
such when they read the Descrip∣tions
of them in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI>
are terrify'd.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="135"/>
To which we Answer, that the
care which Nature has inrooted in
all of their own Preservation, is the
Cause that Men are unavoidably
terrify'd, with any thing that
threatens approaching evil. 'Tis
now our business to shew how
the Ideas of Serpents, Lions, Ty∣gers,
&amp;c. were made by the art
of those great Poets, to be terri∣ble
to their Readers at the same
time that we are secure from their
Objects.</P>
<P>'Tis very plain that it is the
Apprehension of Danger which
causes that emotion in us which
we call Terrour, and it signifies
nothing at all to the purpose whe∣ther
the Danger is real or imagi∣nary;
and 'tis as plain too, that
the Soul never takes the Alarm
from any thing so soon as it does
from the Senses, especially those two
noble ones of the Eye and the Ear,
by reason of the strict assinity
which they have with the Imagi∣nation;
and the Evil always seems
<PB N="91" REF="136"/>
to be very near, when those two
Senses give notice of it; and the
nearer the Evil is the greater
still is the Terror. But now let
us see how those two Poets, did
by Virtue of their Ideas, bring even
absent, Terrible Objects, within the
reach of those two noble Senses.
First then to bring an absent Ter∣rible
Object before our Sight, they
drew an Image or Picture of it;
but to draw an Image or Picture
of a Terrible Object, so as to
surprise and astonish the Soul by
the Eye, they never fail'd to draw
it in violent Action or Motion;
and in Order to that they made
choice of Words and Numbers,
which might best express the violence
of that Action or Motion. For an ab∣sent
Object can never be set before
the Eye in a true Light, unless it
is shewn in violent Action or Motion.
Because unless it is shewn so, the
Soul has leisure to reflect upon the
Deceit. But violent Motion can
never be conceived without a vio∣lent
agitation of Spirit, and that
<PB N="92" REF="137"/>
sudden agitation surptises the Soul
and gives it less time to Reflect;
and at the same time causes the
Impressions that the Objects make
to be so Deep, and their traces to
be so profound, that it makes them
in a manner as present to us as if
they were really before us. For
the Spirits being set in a violent
emotion, and the Imagination being
fir'd by that agitation; and the
Brain being deeply penetrated by
those Impressions, the very Objects
themselves are set as it were be∣fore
us, and consequently we are
sensible of the same Passion that
we should feel from the things
themselves. For the warmer the
Imagination is, the less able we
are to Reflect, and consequently
the things are the more present
to us of which we draw the Ima∣ges;
and therefore when the Ima∣gination
is so inflam'd as to ren∣der
the Soul utterly incapable of
reflecting there is no difference be∣tween
the Images and the things
themselves; as we may see for ex∣ample
<PB N="93" REF="138"/>
by Men in Raging Feavours.
But those two great Poets were not
satisfied with setting absent Objects
before our Eyes, by shewing them
in violent motion; but if their mo∣tion
occasion'd any Extraordinary
Sounds that were terrifying; they
so contriv'd their Numbers and
Expressions, as that they might be
sure to ring those sounds in the
very Ears of their Readers.</P>
<P>We ought now to treat of the
other Enthusiastic Passions, as Hor∣ror,
Grief, Joy and Desire. But to
the End that we may Diversifie this
Treatise as much as we can, and
not tire out the Reader with too
much Speculation at a time, we
shall omit speaking of them till we
come to the Epick Poets.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="94" REF="139"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Recapitulation; and that Reli∣gion
is the Basis and Foun∣dation
of the greater Poe∣try.</HEAD>
<P>BUT now let us Recapitulate:
We have shewn in the fore∣going
part of this Discourse, that
Passion is the Characteristical Mark
of Poetry, and that all Poetry is
pathetick; and then we divided it
into two Kinds, the greater and the
less; and shew'd that the greater
Poetry, comprehends Epick, Tra∣gick
and the greater Lyrick; and
that our Design was in the first
place to treat of that. Then we
proceeded to shew, that as Passion
is the Characteristical Mark of
Poetry, great Passion must be the
<PB N="95" REF="140"/>
Characteristical Mark of the grea∣ter
Poetry, and consequently that
this last must have every where
great Passion; but that since what
we commonly call Passion cannot
be ev'ry where, there must be
something distinct from ordinary
Passion, and that must be Enthusi∣asm.
Then we endeavour'd to
discover what Enthusiasm is, and
how many several sorts there are
of it; and that Admiration and
Terrour make the Principal great∣ness
of Poetry, and are the chief
of the Enthusiastick Passions; that
those two Passions are to bear pro∣portion
with the Ideas from which
they are deriv'd, and that conse∣quently
the greatest must flow
from Religious Ideas. We shall
shew too in the Sequel of this
Discourse, that not only the remain∣ing
Enthusiastick Passions, Horror,
Sadness, Joy and Desire; but that
ev'n the Ordinary Passions which
contribute most to the greatness
of Poetry as Admiration, Terrour
and Pitty are chiefly to be deriv'd
<PB N="96" REF="141"/>
from Religion; but that the Pas∣sions
of both sorts, must for the
most part flow greater from Re∣velation
than from Natural Reli∣gion,
because all Reveal'd Religion
whether true or pretended speaks to
the Senses, brings the wonders of
another World more Home to us,
and so makes the Passions which it
Raises the greater.</P>
<P>The Fundamental Rule then that
we pretend to lay down, for the
Succeeding, or Excelling in the
greater Poetry, is that the Constitu∣tion
of the Poem, be Religious that
it may be throughout Pathetick.</P>
<P>And we pretend to prove un∣deniably
that not only the Gentle∣men,
whose works we design to ex∣amine,
have succeeded and excell'd
no further than their Poems have
been so constituted; but that never
any Poets of any Nation or any
Age, ever did or can excel with∣out
it. I have already prov'd in
the Advancement of modern Poetry,
<PB N="97" REF="142"/>
beyond all manner of doubt, to those
who have Capacity enough to com∣prehend
the Arguments, that the
Ancient Poets excell'd the moderns
in the greatness of Poetry, for no
other reason, but because their Sub∣jects
were Religious in their con∣stitution.
And therefore all that I
shall say of it here is, that Poetry
is the Natural Language of Reli∣gion,
and that Religion at first pro∣duc'd
it, as a Cause produces its
Effect. In the first Ages of wri∣ting
among the Graecians, there was
nothing writ but Verse, because
they wrote of nothing but Religion
which was necessary for the Ce∣menting
the Societies which in those
times were but just united, and Na∣ture
had taught them, that Poetry
was the only Language in which
they could worthily treat of the
most Important parts of Religion,
or worthily perform its most Im∣portant
Duties: But as soon as Re∣ligion
was sufficiently imprinted in
the Minds of Men, and they had
jeisure to Treat of Human things
<PB N="98" REF="143"/>
in their writings they, invented
Prose, and invented it in Imitation
of Verse, as <HI>Strabo</HI> tells us in the
first Book of his Geography; but
after that Prose was invented, by
them; never any of them treated
of their Gods or their Religious
matters, in Prose, before the Age
of <HI>Socrates,</HI> because they found that
that way of writing, was by no
means proper for it. For the won∣ders
of Religion naturally threw them
upon great Passions, and great pas∣sions
naturally threw them upon
Harmony, and Figurative Lan∣guage,
as they most of Necessity
do, any Poet as long as he con∣tinues
Master of them. Which is
known by Experience to all who
are Poets, for never any one while
he was rapt with Enthusiasm or
with Ordinary Passion, wanted
either Words or Harmony, and there∣fore▪
Poetry is more Harmonious
than Prose because it is more Pa∣thetick.
Even in Prose your Ora∣tors
and all who pretend to move
the Passions, have more Harmonious
<PB N="99" REF="144"/>
Periods than they who barely speak
to the Reason. And in Poetry they
who write with a great deal of
Passion are Generally very Harmo∣nious,
whereas those who write
with but little are not so Musical.
<HI>Horace</HI> is an Illustrious Example of
this. No Man who has read his
Odes can doubt of the fineness and
the Delicacy of his Ear; and there∣fore
his Satyrs are often Harsh and
Rugged because the Spirit in them
is mean and little. No Man can
believe that <HI>Juvenal</HI> had a finer
Ear, than <HI>Horace,</HI> but yet his Satyrs
are more Musical because they have
a greater Spirit in them. At the
same time tis a little odd to con∣sider,
that Passion which disturbs the
Soul, should occasion it to produce
Harmony, which seems to emply
the Order and Composure of it.
Whether this proceeds from the
Secret Effort that the Soul makes, to
Compose it self or whatever the
cause is, the Effect is certain. But
as Passion, which is the Disorder of
the Soul; produces Harmony which
<PB N="100" REF="145"/>
is Agreement; so Harmony which
is Concord Augments and propa∣gates
Passion which is Discord. All
who are acquainted with Poetry
or Musick must be as sensible of
this, as Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> was fully con∣vinc'd
of it,
<Q><L>Well sounding Verses are the Charm we use,</L>
<L>Heroick Thoughts and Virtue to infuse;</L>
<L>Things of deep Sense we may in Prose unfold,</L>
<L>But they move more in lofty Numbers told;</L>
<L>By the loud Trumpet which our Courage aids,</L>
<L>We learn that Sound as well as Sense persuades.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus we may see by Mr. <HI>Waller</HI>
that Numbers are proper to move
Passion, and for that Reason are
inseperable from Poetry which has
no other Design. But we shall
have occasion to treat of Harmony
more at large when we come to
the particular sorts of Poems, in the
mean time let us Return to the bu∣siness
from which we may seem to
have digress'd.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="146"/>
As we have formerly undeniably
prov'd in the advancement of
Modern Poetry, that the Ancient
Poets deriv'd that Advantage which
they have over the Moderns to the
constituting their Subjects after a
Religious manner; so I shall make
it appear in the sequel of this Dis∣course,
that it was owing to the
same thing that the ancient Poets
very often excell'd themselves.</P>
<P>And I have Reason to believe
that one of the Principal Reasons,
that has made the Modern Poetry
so contemptible, is, that by divest∣ing
it self of Religion, it is fall'n
from its dignity, and its original
Nature and Excellence, and from
the greatest production of the Mind
of Man, is dwindled to an extra∣vagant
and a vain Amusement.
For the Modern Poetry being for
the most part Prophane, has either
very little Spirit, or if it has a
great one, that Spirit is out of
Nature, because it bears no man∣ner
<PB N="102" REF="147"/>
of Proportion to the Ideas from
which it is forcibly denv'd, nor the
Ideas very often to the Objects from
which they are taken; for as
Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> says,
<Q><L>In boundless Verse the Fancy soars too high</L>
<L>For any Object but the Deity.</L>
<L>What Mortal can with Heav'n pretend to share</L>
<L>In the Superlatives of Wise and Fair?</L>
<L>A meaner Object when with these we grace</L>
<L>A Giant Habit on a Dwarf we place.</L></Q></P>
<P>But that the Modern Poetry as
miserably as it is fall'n from the
Dignity of its original Nature,
might gloriously arise and lift up
its Head, surpassing ev'n that of
the Ancients, if the Poets would
but constitute their Subjects Reli∣gious,
I have formerly clearly shewn
in the Second Part of the Advance∣ment
of Modern Poetry; by shew∣ing
that the Design of the Chri∣stian
Religion is the very same, with
<PB N="103" REF="148"/>
that of Poetry, which can be said
of no other Religion, that the bu∣siness
of both is to delight and re∣form
mankind, by exciting the
Passions in such a manner as to re∣concile
them to Reason, and restore
the Harmony of the humane Facul∣ties.
And therefore that I may re∣peat
nothing at present that I have
formerly said there; I shall only
add, that if 'tis Religion that gives
the warmth and the Passion to
Poetry, it follows that the less mix∣ture
that Religion has of any thing
Prophane and Humane in it, the
greater warmth and Passion it must
give to Poetry; for that which
moves us in effect in a false Religion
must be the Imagination of that
which is true. As for Example in
the above mention'd passage of the
wrath of <HI>Neptune;</HI> the Anger of
<HI>Neptune</HI> is Fiction, and so is the
Stroke of His Trident; but that which
moves us at the bottom of this
Fiction is true, which is, that the
Anger of a Deity and the effects of
it are very terrible. The Rea∣son
<PB N="104" REF="149"/>
why Religion moves the Soul
so extreamly, is because the Soul
was Created by God, to find its
Happiness in Him, and all Happi∣ness
consists in Pleasure, and all
Pleasure in Passion. Now the less
mixture Religion has of any thing
of Human Invention in it, the more
Divine it is and the nearer it brings
us to God.</P>
<P>But that this may still appear
the more clearly, we shall Endea∣vour
to prove it by two very Sig∣nal
Examples, and shall produce two
passages from Scripture; the one
from the <HI>Psalms</HI> and the other from
<HI>Habbakuk;</HI> which we shall set against
the Two foremention'd Passages
which <HI>Longinus</HI> cited from <HI>Ho∣mer;</HI>
the one of the Wrath and the O∣ther
of the Power of <HI>Neptune;</HI> and
his awful march through his own
Element; and in setting these Pas∣sages
against one another we make
no doubt to shew, that not only
the Subjects are exactly the same,
but that the Advantage is clearly
ours.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="150"/>
Let us begin with that Passage
concerning the might of <HI>Neptune,</HI>
and his driving his Chariot thro'
the Sea.</P>
<Q><L>As from the shaggy Mountain He descends,</L>
<L>The Mountain Trembles and the Forest bends,</L></Q>
<P>And anon.</P>
<Q><L>His golden Chariot <HI>Neptune</HI> now Ascends,</L>
<L>And as He drives along the Watry Plain,</L>
<L>Huge Whales and all the Monsters of the Main</L>
<L>Tempest the Ocean to Salute their King,</L>
<L>Ocean Rejoycing yawns before his March</L>
<L>And lets him thro' a dreadful Chasm—</L></Q>
<P>Now to this Passage let us op∣pose
that of the Prophet <HI>Habbakuk</HI>
exactly upon the same occasion; only
the Prophet says of the True God,
what <HI>Homer</HI> says of <HI>Neptune.</HI></P>
<Q><L>When the Almighty from Mount <HI>Paran</HI> came,</L>
<L>The brightness of his Glory with its blaze</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="151"/>
Expanding fill'd the vast Abyss of Heaven</L>
<L>And the whole Earth Resounded with his praise</L>
<L>The Burning Pestilence before him march'd,</L>
<L>And from his Feet a Fiery Whirlwind flew,</L>
<L>He stood and Measur'd the Extended Earth,</L>
<L>Scattering the Trembling Nations with a Look,</L>
<L>At which the Everlasting Mountains fled,</L>
<L>And shaking the perpetual Hills did bow,</L>
<L>Against the Flouds was thy Fierce Anger then?</L>
<L>Against the Sea the burning of thy Wrath!</L>
<L>That thou didst thro' it with thy Flaming Steeds</L>
<L>And with thy Chariots of Salvation drive?</L>
<L>The Rocks their Sommets beetled o'er their base</L>
<L>To view the Terrours of thy wondrous March;</L>
<L>Then Shivering shrunk from the amazing Sigh.</L>
<L>The Flouds dividing shew'd a fearful Chasm,</L>
<L>And asthy Sounding Horses all on Fire,</L>
<L>Tro' Heaps of Congregated Waters flew,</L>
<L>The Deep his roaring Voice at all his. Mouths</L>
<L>Utter'd, and lifted all his Arms on High.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="107" REF="152"/>But now let us come to the
wrath of <HI>Neptune,</HI> and the effects
of it, in the Battel of the Twen∣tieth
of the <HI>Iliads,</HI> in which the
Gods were engag'd.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Jove</HI> flung his dreadful Thunder from on high,</L>
<L>Mean while Majestick <HI>Neptune</HI> from below,</L>
<L>The reeling Globe with his huge Trident strook,</L>
<L>Shook its vast Plains and made its Mountains smoak.</L>
<L>Mount <HI>Ida</HI> trembled from his Hoary Top,</L>
<L>And from his Nethermost Foundations Shook,</L>
<L>Troubling a Thousand Springs that from Him flow</L>
<L><HI>Pluto</HI> from Lowest Hell, both Heard and Felt,</L>
<L>And shivering Started from his Burning Throne;</L>
<L>Then Striking his Infernal Breast Cry'd out,</L>
<L>Least wrathful <HI>Neptune,</HI> with another Stroke</L>
<L>Of his Dread Trident, shou'd the Globe Divide,</L>
<L>Should to the Gaping Center, let in Light,</L>
<L>To Mortals, and Immortals should Display,</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="153"/>
The Dreadful Secrets of his dire Domain,</L>
<L>At the bare thought of which Ev'n Gods are wont (to shake,</L></Q>
<P>As the necessity of the Subject
has oblig'd us to repeat these Ver∣ses,
so we have the same Excuse
for the Repeating the Reflection, of
<HI>Longinus.</HI> Behold here says <HI>Longinus,</HI>
the Earth laid open to the very
Center, and Hell about to be
Expos'd to view, and all the vast
Machine of the World; Demo∣lish'd.
and overturn'd, to shew
that in that Important Conflict,
both Heaven and Hell, both Mor∣tal
and Immortal things, every
thing in Nature Engag'd with the
Gods and nothing was free from
Danger. Now let us see the Psalmist
Introducing the true God, actual∣ly
Demolishing and overturning
the Machine of the World only with
a Word and with a Look.</P>
<Q><L>In my Distress I call'd upon the Lord,</L>
<L>And to my God I cry'd, He from his Height</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="154"/>
Above all Heights, Strait heard my Mournful Voice,</L>
<L>And to my loud Complaint inclin'd his Ear.</L>
<L>Strait the Earth trembled and her Entrails shook</L>
<L>As Conscious of her Great Creators Wrath.</L>
<L>The Mountains from their fix'd Foundations ran,</L>
<L>And Frighted from their inmost Caverns Roar'd.</L>
<L>From out his Nostrils a Tempestuous Cloud</L>
<L>Of pitchy smoak in Spicy Volumes flew,</L>
<L>And from his Mouth there ran a Raging Flood</L>
<L>Of Torrent fire Devouring as it ran.</L>
<L>And then He Bow'd the very Heaven of Heavens,</L>
<L>And arm'd with fearful Majesty came down.</L>
<L>Under his Feet He plac'd Substantial Night</L>
<L>Which aw'd the Nations with its dreadful Gloom</L>
<L>Upon the Flaming Cherubim He Rode,</L>
<L>And on the Wings of all the Winds He flew,</L>
<L>Still Darkness usher'd his Mysterious way,</L>
<L>And a Black Night of Congregated Clouds</L>
<L>Became the Dark Pavillion of his Throne.</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="155"/>
The Clouds his Brightness could no longer bear,</L>
<L>But vanishing Rever'd the Sacred sourse of Light,</L>
<L>And as the Congregated Clouds Dispers'd</L>
<L>A Storm of Monstrous Hail came pouring: down,</L>
<L>Down the Red Lightning wing'd its Slanting way</L>
<L>But when his wrathful Voice was heard on High</L>
<L>Strait both the Poles Rebellow'd to the Sound,</L>
<L>In thicker sheets the Ratling Hail came down,</L>
<L>Down came the Lightning with repeated Flames</L>
<L>And Thunder bellowing thro' the boundless Space.</L>
<L>Astonish'd Nature with Redoubled Roars,</L>
<L>Earth could no longer bear the mortal fright</L>
<L>But shook it self from its perpetual Hinge</L>
<L>At thy Rebuke O Lord and at the Blast,</L>
<L>The Dreadful Blast of thy Revenging Breath,</L>
<L>Then upwards from the gaping Center cleav'd</L>
<L>With a prodigious wound;</L>
<L>The fix'd Foundations of the World display'd,</L>
<L>Display'd the Ghastful Caverns of the Deep,</L>
<L>A sight that blasted ev'n the World's Great Eye,</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="156"/>
And made the Starting Sun recoil</L>
<L>From his Eternal way.</L></Q>
<P>But here it will be Necessary to
answer an Objection, for it may be
urg'd perhaps that Common Expe∣rience
will Destroy these new Specu∣lations.
For several of the Moderns
have attempted Divine Poetry, and yet
some of them have been Contemp∣tible
to the last Degree, and not
one of them has excell'd the An∣cients.</P>
<P>To which we answer that <HI>Milton</HI>
has clearly the advantage of the An∣cients
in several points, as shall be
shewn in its proper place; and if the
rest of the Moderns who have attemp∣ted
Sacred Poetry have fall'n so very
much short of them, it has been either
for want of Genius or for want of
Art to know how to make use of
Religion. For Sacred Poetry ap∣parently
requires a greater capacity
than the Prophane does, because
the greater the Ideas are, the greater
<PB N="112" REF="157"/>
must the Capacity be that receives
them. But Sacred Ideas are greater
then the Prophane, as hath been
shewn above. And therefore if the
Rule of <HI>Horace</HI> be true, that a Poet
ought to proportion his Subject to
his Strength, it follows that a Man
may Succeed pretty well in Hu∣man
Poetry and yet be despicable in
the Divine. Besides as Religion
supplies us with greater Ideas than
any thing Human can do; so it re∣quires
greater Enthusiasm and a
greater Spirit to attend them, as
has been shewn above too. So that
Sacred Poetry requires not only a
very great Capacity, but a very
warm and Strong Imagination;
which is a happy mixture that is to be
met with in a very few, and ev'n of
those few not one in a Thousand per∣haps
applies himself to sacred Poetry.
And ev'n of those rare ones who have
apply'd themselves hardly one of the
Moderns has known the true use that
ought to be made of Religion in
Poetry. <HI>Milton,</HI> indeed happen'd
upon it, in his Paridise lost, I say hap∣pen'd
upon it, because He has err'd
<PB N="113" REF="158"/>
very widely from it in his Paradise
Regain'd, as shall be shewn in its pro∣per
place. The Rules for Employ∣ing
Religion in Poetry are Principal∣ly
these which follow.</P>
<P>1. The First is, That the Reli∣gion
ought to be one, that the
Poet may be mov'd by it, and
that he may appear to be in ear∣nest.
And the not observing of
this Rule, was one Reason why
<HI>Spencer</HI> miscarried as we shall shew
anon.</P>
<P>2. The Second Rule, That the
Religion which the Poet Employs
ought to be the Reigning one,
that both the Poet and the Rea∣ders
may be mov'd the more by
a Religion in which they were
bred. And this Rule may acquaint us
with one of the reasons why all who
have translated <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI>
have succeeded so very indiffe∣rently.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="159"/>
3. The Third is that it may run
thro' and be incorporated with the
Action of the Poem, and conse∣quently
that it may always be a
part of Action and Productive of
Action, for from the neglect of
this Third Rule, strange inequali∣ties
would follow in a Poem, as
shall be shewn more at large,
when we treat of <HI>Spencer</HI> and
<HI>Cowley.</HI></P>
<P>4. The Fourth Rule is, That the
Religion may be manag'd so as to
promote the violence of the En∣thusiastick
Passions and their change
and variety; and the constituting
his Subject contrary to this Rule,
was one great reason why <HI>Milton</HI>
did not succeed in his Paradise
Regain'd.</P>
<P>5. That it may not hinder the
Violence of the ordinary Passions,
nor the Change and Variety of
them; and the not constituting
his Subject according to this
<PB N="115" REF="160"/>
Rule is the chief reason, why
<HI>Homer</HI> in his Odysses fell so far
short of his Iliads; and <HI>Milton</HI> of
his Paradise Lost, in his Paradise
Regain'd.</P>
<P>6. That the Religion be manag'd
so as not to obstruct the violence
of Action, which is always attend∣ed
by the violence of ordinary
Passion; and the not observing of
this, was one great Reason of the
miscarriage of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI>
in the foremention'd Poems.</P>
<P>7. That the Divine and Humane
Persons if there be any, may have
Inclinations and Affections, which
<HI>Tasso</HI>'s Celestial Persons have not,
nor as I Remember <HI>Cowley</HI>'s.</P>
<P>8. That they be fairly distin∣guish'd
from one another, by those
Inclinations and Affections. And
this is the great Advantage that
the Grecian Machines, have for
the most part over those in our Re∣ligion.
Yet <HI>Milton</HI> has pretty well
<PB N="116" REF="161"/>
distinguish'd his Celestial Persons
from one another, and his Infernal
ones admirably.</P>
<P>4. That they be fairly distinguish∣ed
from the Human Persons, by
the same Inclinations and Affections.
And here <HI>Milton</HI> in his Infernal
Persons has undeniably the Advan∣tage,
both of Ancients and Moderns.
The Passions and Inclinations of
the Graecian Gods, are downright
Human Inclinations and Affections.
The Passions of <HI>Miltons</HI>'s Devils have
enough of Humanity in them to
make them delightful, but then they
have a great deal more to make
them admirable and may be said
to be the true Passions of Devils;
but the time to speak more largely
of this will be when we come to
the Epick Poets.</P>
<P>But now as we have shewn that
the Religion Reveal'd in the Old
and New Testament is proper, nay
Necessary to give the last force
and Elevation to Poetry; we shall
<PB N="117" REF="162"/>
now Endeavour to Convince the
Reader that Poetry is proper if not
Necessary, to give force to that
Religion. For indeed there are Du∣ties
in this Religion, which cannot
be worthily perform'd without the
a ssistance of Poetry. As the offe∣ring
up Praise and Thanksgiving
and several sorts of Pray'r to God;
and the Celebrating the Wonders
of his Might? Because if the Ideas
which these Subjects afford; are
exprest with Passion equal to their
greatness, that which expresses them
is Poetry, for that which makes
Poetry to be what it is, is only
because it has more Passion than
any other way of writing.</P>
<P>It is Ridiculous to Imagine that
there can be a more proper way to Ex∣press
some parts and Duties of a Re∣ligion
which we believe to be Di∣vinely
inspir'd, than the very way
in which they were at first deli∣ver'd.
Now the most Important
part of the Old Testament was
deliver'd not only in a Poetical
<PB N="118" REF="163"/>
Style but in Poetical Numbers. The
most Important parts of the Old
Testament to us are the Prophesies.
Because without them we could
never be satisfied that <HI>Jesus</HI> is
the Messiah, For the Prophets
were Poets by the Institution of
their Order, and Poetry was one
of the Prophetick Functions, which
were chiefly Three. 1. Predicting
or foretelling things to come. 2.
Declaring the will of God to the
People. And 3. Praising God with
Songs of the Prophets composing,
accompanied with the Harp and
other Instrumental Musick. From
whence it came to pass, that
praising God upon such kind of
Instruments, is often in the Scrip∣tures
call'd Prophecying, as Mr.
<HI>Mede</HI> has observ'd in his Diatribae;
and has prov'd it from several Pas∣sages
of the Old Testament, and
more particularly from the 3 First
Verses of the 25th Ch. of the <HI>Chro∣nicles,</HI>
which are as follows.</P>
<P>V. 1.Moreover <HI>David</HI> and the
Captains of the Host, seperated to
<PB N="119" REF="164"/>
the Service of the Sons of <HI>Asaph,</HI>
and of <HI>Heman,</HI> and of <HI>Jeduthun,</HI>
such as should Prophesie with Harps,
with Psalteries and with Cymbals, and
the Number of the Workmen accord∣ing
to their service was</P>
<P>V. 2. Of the Sons of <HI>Asaph; Zac∣car,</HI>
and <HI>Joseph,</HI> and <HI>Nethaniah</HI> and
<HI>Asarelah,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Asaph;</HI> under
the Hands of <HI>Asaph,</HI> which Prophesied
according to the Order of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>V. 3.Of <HI>Jeduthun,</HI> the Sons of
<HI>Jeduthun, Gedaliah</HI> and <HI>Zeri</HI> and <HI>Je∣shaiah,
Hashabiah,</HI> and <HI>Metithiah</HI>
Six, under the Hands of their Father
<HI>Jeduthun, who Prophesied with a Harp,
to give thanks and to praise the
Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was their Poetical Talent
confin'd to their Praise and thanks∣giving,
but is to be seen in their
Predictions too as we said before,
and in their declaring the Will of
God to the People.</P>
<P>As the Prophets were Poets by
their Institution, so when the Son
<PB N="120" REF="165"/>
of God himself, came down from
Heaven in order to reform the
Earth, He who was a Prophet as
well as a Priest and a King, did
by consequence discharge the Three
Prophetical Functions, of which
the Poetical has been shewn to be
one. And consequently tho' our
Saviour did not make use of a
Style, that was Figurative and
Enthusiastick; because he Instructed
the World as God, and as God He
could not feel either Admiration or
Terrour, or the rest of the Enthusia∣stick
Passions, yet we find that
He not only prais'd God with spi∣ritual
Songs, but that the Method
of His Instruction was entirely
Poetical, that is by Fables or Pa∣rables,
contriv'd and plac'd and
adapted to work very strongly up∣on
Human Passions.</P>
<P>Thus the Prophets among the
Jews were Poets, and the Divine
Institutor of the Christian Religi∣on
being a Prophet, by a Poetical
method instructed and reform'd the
<PB N="121" REF="166"/>
World. And ev'n the Graecian Poets
pretending to discharge the Three
Prophetical Functions, were not only
vulgarly reputed Prophets but were
ftyl'd so by St. <HI>Paul</HI> Himself, who
quoting a verse out of <HI>Epimenides</HI>
in the Epistle which He wrote to
<HI>Titus,</HI> calls that Cretensian Poet a
Prophet. <HI>As one of their own Pro∣phets
has said.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have made it very
plain, that not only the Predictions
but the Praise and Thanksgiving,
in the Inspir'd Writers were written
in Verse; as were likewise several
of the Prayers, and the Instructions,
and in short the Noblest and mostIm∣portant
part of the Old Testament:
Now if they were written in Po∣etry,
it could be for no other Rea∣son,
but because they who wrote
them, Believ'd that the Figurative
Passionate Style, and the Poetical
Numbers did by Right of Nature
belong to them, and Conse∣quently
were requisite to inforce
them upon the Minds of Men. And
<PB N="122" REF="167"/>
here we cannot as it were help ob∣serving,
that for the Scriptures to
make all the Impression that they
are Capable of making upon Men
of very good parts, and perhaps
too upon others, all those parts of
them that were written in Verse
ought to be translated in Verse; and
by Persons who are the most qua∣lify'd
to do it with Force and Har∣mony.
For if the Passion and
Harmony were thought requisite
by the Original Writers, who were
Divinely inspir'd to give force to
the Hebrew; why should not Spi∣rit
and Passion and Numbers in a
Translation give a Proportionable
force to that? For if Harmony of
it self is of force to lift up our
Thoughts to Heaven, as our
Clergy seem to Emply by the use
of it in our Churches; and may
be gathered from what happen'd
to <HI>Elisha</HI> in the Second of <HI>Kings,</HI>
when they would have had him
Prophesie at a time when the Spirit
of Prophesie Ch. 3. v. 15. was not upon
him. Where the Prophet says, <HI>now bring
me a Minstrel, and it came to pass
<PB N="123" REF="168"/>
as the Minstrel plaid that the Hand
of the Lord came upon him.</HI></P>
<P>If Harmony I say is of it self so ef∣ficacious,
what must it not be,
when Incorporated with a Religi∣gious
Sense, and a Poetical Style.
There can certainly be no better
way to Reform the World than
the reading of those Writings which
we believe to be divinely inspir'd;
But this is as certain, that the
greater the pleasure is with which we
Read them, we shall the more
frequently discharge that Duty, but
to make us read them with more
pleasure than we do, they must have
more of the agreableness of their
Originals, that is more Perspicuity,
more Force and more Harmony. This
would more particularly attract the
Gentry, and particularly those of
the most Extraordinary Parts among
them, whose examples would influ∣ence
the rest as the rest would influ∣ence
the People. For they of extra∣ordinary
Parts for the most part being
Extreamly delighted with Poetry,
<PB N="124" REF="169"/>
and finding the greatest and most
exalted Poetry upon Religious Sub∣jects,
would by degrees become more
us'd to be mov'd by Sacred Ideas
than they would by prophane; that
is would by degrees become re∣form'd.
That this is by no
means a Chimera, Experience may
serve to convince us. For I know
several Gentlemen of very good
Sense who are extreamly mov'd
by <HI>Miltons</HI> Hymn in the fifth Book
of Paradise lost, and hardly at all
stirr'd with the Translation of the
148 <HI>Psalm</HI> from whence that Hymn
is taken. But if Men of very good
parts are more mov'd by the Hymn,
it follows that they ought to be
more mov'd by it; because Men of
very good Sense are only mov'd to
that Degree by things by which
they ought to be mov'd. So that
we may Conclude that the Passi∣on
or Enthusiasm in that Hymn
is exactly in Nature, that is, that
the Enthusiasm, or Passion, or Spirit
call it what you will, flows from
the Ideas, and bears a just Propor∣tion
to them.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="170"/>
But from hence at the same
time it follows, that since those
Persons who are so much mov'd
by the Hymn, are not equally stirr'd
by the Translated Psalm, the Pas∣sion
or Spirit is less in the latter
and do's not come up to the Ideas;
and therefore we may conclude
that <HI>Milton</HI> by his Genius and Har∣mony
has restor'd that Spirit in
Composing the Hymn, which had
been lost by the weakness of the
Translation and the want of Poe∣tical
Numbers. Which last as we
have said before contribute very
much to the raising of Passion.</P>
<P>What <HI>Milton</HI> has done in relation
to the 148 <HI>Psalm,</HI> others may do
in a less proportion to other parts
of the Old Testament, till the Fa∣vour
of the Prince and publick En∣couragement
causes another <HI>Milton</HI>
to arise and apply Himself to so
necessary and so noble a work.
For this is certain that there are
not wanting great Genius's to every
Age. But they do not equally ap∣pear
<PB N="126" REF="171"/>
in every Age, sometimes for want
of knowing themselves; and some∣times
for want of Encouragement
and leisure to exert themselves. The
business of the following Treatise is to
shew them how they may try and
know, and form themselves, which
is all that I am capable of attempting
towards the Restoring so useful and so
noble an Art. If I were in a Condi∣tion
to give them Encouragement
too they should not be long with∣out
it. If they who so much ex∣ceed
me in Pow'r, did but equal
me in Will, we should soon see
Poetry raise up its dejected Head,
and our own might come to emu∣late
the Happiest of Grecian and
Roman Ages.</P>
<P>And thus much may suffice to
shew the Nature of Poetry, but
chiefly of the greater Poetry,
and the Importance of this De∣sign.
For since Poetry has been
thought not only by Heathens, but
by the Writers of the Old Testa∣ment,
and consequently by God
Himself who inspir'd them, to be
<PB N="127" REF="172"/>
the fittest method for the inforcing
Religion upon the Minds of Men,
and since Religion is the only solid
Foundation of all Civil Society,
it follows, that whoever Endea∣vours
to Re-establish Poetry, makes
a generous attempt to restore an
Art, that may be highly Advan∣tageous
to the Publick, and Bene∣ficial
to Mankind.</P>
