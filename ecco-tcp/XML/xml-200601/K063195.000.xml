<L>Or chill'd by age, their airy dance</L>
<L>They leave, in dust to rest.</L>
</LG>

<L>Methinks I hear in accents low</L>
<L>The sportive kind reply:</L>
<L>Poor moralist! and what art thou?</L>
<L>A solitary fly!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Thy Joys no glittering female meets,</L>
<L>No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,</L>

<L>On hasty wings thy youth is flown;</L>
<L>Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone—</L>

<L>Employ'd the power of Fairy hands</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To raise the cieling's fretted height,</L>
<L>Each pannel in achievements cloathing,</L>

<L>A House there is, (and that's enough)</L>

<L>A brace of Warriors, not in buff,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The other Amazon kind Heaven</L>
<L>Had arm'd with spirit, wit, and satire:</L>

<L>And tip'd her arrows with good-nature.</L>

<L>Fame in the shape of Mr. P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t</L>
<L>(By this time all the Parish know it)</L>
<L>Had told, that thereabouts there lurk'd</L>
<L>A wicked Imp they call a Poet,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who prowl'd the country far and near,</L>
<L>Bewitch'd the children of the peasants,</L>
<L>Dried up the cows, and lam'd the deer,</L>
<L>And suck'd the eggs, and kill'd the pheasants.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Lady heard their joint petition,</L>
<L>Swore by her coronet and ermine,</L>
<L>She'd issue out her high commission</L>
<L>To rid the manour of such vermin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Heroines undertook the task,</L>
<L>Thro'lanes unknown, o'er stiles they ventur'd,</L>
<L>Rap'd at the door, nor stay'd to ask,</L>
<L>But bounce into the parlour enter'd.</L>

<L>The trembling family they daunt,</L>
<L>They flirt, they sing, they laugh, they tattle,</L>
<L>Rummage his Mother, pinch his Aunt,</L>
<L>And up stairs in a whirlwind rattle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each hole and cupboard they explore,</L>
<L>Each creek and cranny of his chamber,</L>
<L>Run hurry-skurry round the floor,</L>
<L>And o'er the bed and tester clamber,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Into the Drawers and China pry,</L>
<L>Papers and books, a huge Imbroglio!</L>
<L>Under a tea-cup he might lie,</L>
<L>Or creased, like dogs-ears, in a folio.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On the first marching of the troops</L>
<L>The Muses, hopeless of his pardon,</L>
<L>Convey'd him underneath their hoops</L>
<L>To a small closet in the garden.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
<L>So Rumor says. (Who will, believe.)</L>
<L>But that they left the door a-jarr,</L>
<L>Where, safe and laughing in his sleeve,</L>
<L>He heard the distant din of war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Short was his joy. He little knew,</L>
<L>The power of Magick was no fable.</L>
<L>Out of the window, whisk, they flew,</L>
<L>But left a spell upon the table.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The words too eager to unriddle</L>
<L>The Poet felt a strange disorder:</L>
<L>Transparent birdlime form'd the middle,</L>
<L>And chains invisible the border.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So cunning was the Apparatus,</L>
<L>The powerful pothooks did so move him,</L>
<L>That, will he, nill he, to the Great-house</L>
<L>He went, as if the Devil drove him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
<L>Yet on his way (no sign of grace,</L>

<L>To Phoebus he prefer'd his case,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Godhead would have back'd his quarrel,</L>
<L>But with a blush on recollection</L>
<L>Own'd, that his quiver and his laurel</L>
<L>'Gainst four such eyes were no protection.</L>

<L>The Court was sate, the Culprit there,</L>
<L>Forth from their gloomy mansions creeping</L>
<L>The Lady <HI>Janes</HI> and <HI>Joans</HI> repair,</L>

<L>Thy philosophic Train be there</L>
<L>To soften, not to wound my heart,</L>
<L>The gen'rous spark extinct revive,</L>
<L>Teach me to love and to forgive,</L>
<L>Exact my own defects to scan,</L>
<L>What others are, to feel, and know myself a Man.</L>

<HEAD> ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH YARD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,</L>
<L>The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,</L>
<L>The plowman homeward plods his weary way,</L>
<L>And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
<L>Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</L>
<L>And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</L>
<L>Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,</L>
<L>And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r</L>
<L>The mopeing owl does to the moon complain</L>
<L>Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,</L>
<L>Molest her ancient solitary reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,</L>
<L>Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,</L>
<L>Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,</L>
<L>The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,</L>
<L>The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,</L>
<L>The cock's shrill clarion, or the ecchoing horn,</L>
<L>No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
<L>For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,</L>
<L>Or busy houswife ply her evening care:</L>
<L>No children run to lisp their sire's return,</L>
<L>Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,</L>
<L>Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;</L>
<L>How jocund did they drive their team afield!</L>
<L>How bow'd the woods beneath their study stroke!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,</L>
<L>Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;</L>
<L>Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,</L>
<L>The short and simple annals of the poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,</L>
<L>And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,</L>
<L>Awaits alike th' inevitable hour.</L>
<L>The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
<L>Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,</L>
<L>If Mem'ry o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise,</L>
<L>Where thro' the long-drawn isle and fretted vault</L>
<L>The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can storied urn or animated bust</L>
<L>Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?</L>
<L>Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,</L>
<L>Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid</L>
<L>Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire,</L>
<L>Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,</L>
<L>Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page</L>
<L>Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;</L>
<L>Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,</L>
<L>And froze the genial current of the soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
<L>Full many a gem of purest ray serene,</L>
<L>The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:</L>
<L>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</L>
<L>And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast</L>
<L>The little Tyrant of his fields withstood;</L>
<L>Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,</L>
<L>Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,</L>
<L>The threats of pain and ruin to despise,</L>
<L>To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,</L>
<L>And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their lot forbad: nor circumscrib'd alone</L>
<L>Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd;</L>
<L>Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,</L>
<L>And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
<L>The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,</L>
<L>To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,</L>
<L>Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride</L>
<L>With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,</L>
<L>Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;</L>
<L>Along the cool sequester'd vale of life</L>
<L>They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect</L>
<L>Some frail memorial still erected nigh,</L>
<L>With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,</L>
<L>Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,</L>
<L>The place of fame and elegy supply:</L>
<L>And many a holy text around she strews,</L>
<L>That teach the rustic moralist to dye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
<L>For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,</L>
<L>This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,</L>
<L>Left the warm precincts of the chearful day,</L>
<L>Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On some fond breast the parting soul relies,</L>
<L>Some pious drops the closing eye requires;</L>
<L>Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,</L>
<L>Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead</L>
<L>Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;</L>
<L>If chance, by lonely contemplation led,</L>
<L>Some kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,</L>
<L>'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn</L>
<L>'Brushing with hasty steps the dews away</L>
<L>'To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
<L>'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech</L>
<L>'That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,</L>
<L>'His listless length at noontide wou'd he stretch,</L>
<L>'And pore upon the brook that babbles by.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,</L>
<L>'Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he wou'd rove,</L>
<L>'Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,</L>
<L>'Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,</L>
<L>'Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;</L>
<L>'Another came; nor yet beside the rill,</L>
<L>'Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'The next with dirges due in sad array</L>
<L>'Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him born.</L>
<L>'Approach and read (for thou can'st read) the lay,</L>
<L>'Grav'd on the stone beneath you aged thorn.</L>

<HEAD>The EPITAPH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HERE rests his head upon the lap of Earth</L>
<L>A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown,</L>
<L>Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,</L>
<L>And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,</L>
<L>Heav'n did a recompence as largely send:</L>
<L>He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,</L>
<L>He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No farther seek his merits to disclose,</L>
<L>Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,</L>
<L>(There they alike in trembling hope repose)</L>
<L>The bosom of his Father and his God.</L>
