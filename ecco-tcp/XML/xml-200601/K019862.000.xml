<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Subject propos'd. Inscribed to Lady <HI>HERT∣FORD.</HI>
This Season is described as it affects
the various parts of Nature, ascending from
the lower to the higher; and mixed with Di∣gressions
arising from the subject. Its influence
on inanimate Matter, on Vegetables, on brute
Animals, and last on Man; concluding with a
Dissuasive from the wild and irregular passion
of love, opposed to that of a purer and more
reasonable kind.</P>

<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>OME, gentle SPRING, AETHEREAL
MILDNESS, come,</L>
<L>And from the bosom of yon dropping
cloud,</L>
<L>While music wakes around, veil'd in a shower</L>
<L>Of shadowing roses, on our plains descend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="5">O HERTFORD, fitted, or to shine in courts,</L>
<L>With unaffected grace; or walk the plain,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
With INNOCENCE and MEDITATION join'd</L>
<L>In soft assemblage, listen to my song,</L>
<L>That thy own Season paints; when NATURE all</L>
<L N="10">Is blooming, and benevolent like thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND see where surly WINTER passes off,</L>
<L>Far to the north, and calls his ruffian blasts;</L>
<L>His blasts obey, and quit the howling hill,</L>
<L>The shatter'd forest, and the ravag'd vale:</L>
<L N="15">While softer gales succeed, at whose kind touch,</L>
<L>Dissolving snows in livid torrents lost,</L>
<L>The mountains lift their green heads to the sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As yet the trembling year is unconfirm'd,</L>
<L>And WINTER oft at eve resumes the breeze,</L>
<L N="20">Chills the pale morn, and bids his driving sleets</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Deform the day delightless; so that scarce</L>
<L>The Bittern knows the time, with bill ingulpht</L>
<L>To shake the sounding marsh; or from the shore</L>
<L>The Plovers theirs, to scatter o'er the heath,</L>
<L N="25">And sing their wild notes to the listening waste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT last from ARIES rolls the bounteous sun,</L>
<L>And the bright BULL receives him. Then no more</L>
<L>Th' expansive atmosphere is cramp'd with cold,</L>
<L>But full of life, and vivifying soul,</L>
<L>Lifts the light clouds sublime, and spreads them thin,</L>
<L N="31">Fleecy, and white, o'er all-surrounding heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FORTH fly the tepid airs; and unconfin'd</L>
<L>Unbinding earth, the moving softness strays.</L>
<L>Joyous th' impatient husbandman perceives</L>
<L N="35"><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Relenting nature, and his lusty steers,</L>
<L>Drives from their stalls, to where the well-us'd plow</L>
<L>Lies in the furrow loosen'd from the frost.</L>
<L>There, unrefusing to the harness'd yoke,</L>
<L>They lend their shoulder, and begin their toil,</L>
<L N="40">Chear'd by the simple song, and soaring lark.</L>
<L>Meanwhile incumbent o'er the shining share</L>
<L>The master leans, removes th' obstructing clay,</L>
<L>Winds the whole work, and sidelong lays the glebe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHITE thro' the neighbouring fields the sower stalks</L>
<L N="45">With measur'd step, and liberal throws the grain</L>
<L>Into the faithful bosom of the Ground.</L>
<L>The harrow follows harsh, and shuts the scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BE gracious, HEAVEN! for now laborious man</L>
<L>Has done his due. Ye fostering breezes, blow!</L>
<L N="50"><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Ye softening dews, ye tender showers, descend!</L>
<L>And temper all, thou world-reviving sun,</L>
<L>Into the perfect year! Nor, ye who live</L>
<L>In luxury and ease, in pomp and pride,</L>
<L>Think these lost themes unworthy of your ear.</L>
<L N="55">'Twas such as these the rural MARO sung,</L>
<L>To the full ROMAN court, in all its height</L>
<L>Of elegance and taste. The sacred plow</L>
<L>Employ'd the kings and fathers of mankind,</L>
<L>In antient times. And some, with whom compar'd</L>
<L N="60">You're but the beings of a summer's day,</L>
<L>Have held the scale of justice, shook the lance</L>
<L>Of mighty war, then with descending hand,</L>
<L>Unus'd to little delicacies, seiz'd</L>
<L>The plow, and greatly independant liv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<L N="65">YE generous BRITONS, cultivate the plow!</L>
<L>And o'er your hills, and long withdrawing vales,</L>
<L>Let AUTUMN spread his treasures to the sun,</L>
<L>Luxuriant, and unbounded. As the sea,</L>
<L>Far thro' his azure, turbulent extent,</L>
<L N="70">Your empire owns, and from a thousand shores</L>
<L>Wafts all the pomp of life into your ports;</L>
<L>So with superior boon may your rich soil,</L>
<L>Exuberant, nature's better blessings pour</L>
<L>O'er every land, the naked nations cloath,</L>
<L N="75">And be th' exhaustless granary of a world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR thro' the lenient air alone, this change</L>
<L>Delicious breathes; the penetrative sun,</L>
<L>His force deep darting to the dark retreat</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Of vegetation, sets the steaming power</L>
<L N="80">At large, to wander o'er the verdant earth,</L>
<L>In various hues, but chiefly thee, gay GREEN!</L>
<L>Thou smiling NATURE's universal robe!</L>
<L>United light and shade! where the sight dwells</L>
<L>With growing strength, and ever-new delight!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="85">FROM the moist meadow to the brown-brow'd
hill,</L>
<L>Led by the breeze, the vivid verdure runs,</L>
<L>And swells, and deepens to the cherish'd eye.</L>
<L>The hawthorn whitens; and the juicy groves</L>
<L>Put forth their buds, unfolding by degrees,</L>
<L N="90">Till the whole leafy forest stands display'd,</L>
<L>In full luxuriance, to the sighing gales;</L>
<L>While the deer rustle thro' the twining brake,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
And the birds sing conceal'd. At once array'd</L>
<L>In all the colours of the flushing year,</L>
<L N="95">By NATURE's swift and secret-working hand,</L>
<L>The garden glows, and fills the liberal air</L>
<L>With lavish fragrance; while the promis'd fruit</L>
<L>Lies yet a little embryo, unperceiv'd,</L>
<L>Within its crimson folds. Now from the town</L>
<L N="100">Buried in smoke, and sleep, and noisom damps,</L>
<L>Oft let me wander o'er the dewy fields,</L>
<L>Where freshness breathes, and dash the lucid drops</L>
<L>From the bent bush, as thro' the fuming maze</L>
<L>Of sweet-briar hedges I pursue my walk;</L>
<L N="105">Or taste the smell of dairy; or ascend</L>
<L>Some eminence, AUGUSTA, in thy plains,</L>
<L>And see the country far diffus'd around</L>
<L>One boundless blush, one white empurpled shower</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Of mingled blossoms; where the raptur'd eye</L>
<L N="110">Travels from joy to joy, and hid beneath</L>
<L>The fair profusion, yellow AUTUMN spies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF brush'd from RUSSIAN wilds a cutting gale</L>
<L>Rise not, and scatter from his foggy wings</L>
<L>The bitter mildew, or dry-blowing breathe</L>
<L N="115">Untimely frost; before whose baleful blast,</L>
<L>The full-blown SPRING thro' all her foliage shrinks,</L>
<L>Into a smutty, wide-dejected waste.</L>
<L>For oft engender'd by the hazy north,</L>
<L>Myriads on Myriads, insect armies waft</L>
<L N="120">Keen in the poison'd breeze; and wasteful eat</L>
<L>Thro' buds, and bark, into the blacken'd Core,</L>
<L>Their eager way. A feeble race! scarce seen,</L>
<L>Save by the prying eye? yet famine waits</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
On their corrosive course, and kills the year.</L>
<L N="125">Sometimes o'er cities as they steer their flight,</L>
<L>Where rising vapour melts their wings away,</L>
<L>Gaz'd by th' astonish'd crowd, the horrid shower</L>
<L>Descends. And hence the skilful farmer chaff.</L>
<L>And blazing straw before his orchard burns;</L>
<L N="130">Till, all involv'd in smoke, the latent foe</L>
<L>From every cranny suffocated falls;</L>
<L>Or onions, steaming hot, beneath his trees</L>
<L>Exposes, fatal to the frosty tribe:</L>
<L>Nor, from their friendly task, the busy bill</L>
<L N="135">Of little trooping birds instinctive scares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE are not idle philosophick dreams,</L>
<L>Full NATURE swarms with life. Th' unfaithful fen</L>
<L>In putrid steams emits the livid cloud</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
Of Pestilence. Thro' subterranean Cells,</L>
<L N="140">Where searching sun-beams never found a way,</L>
<L>Earth animated heaves. The flowery leaf</L>
<L>Wants not its soft inhabitants. The stone,</L>
<L>Hard as it is, in every winding pore</L>
<L>Holds multitudes. But chief the forest-boughs,</L>
<L N="145">Which dance unnumber'd to th' inspiring breeze,</L>
<L>The downy orchard, and the melting pulp</L>
<L>Of mellow fruit the nameless nations feed</L>
<L>Of evanescent Insects. Where the pool</L>
<L>Stands mantled o'er with green, invisible,</L>
<L N="150">Amid the floating verdure millions stray.</L>
<L>Each liquid too, whether of acid taste,</L>
<L>Potent, or mild, with various forms abounds.</L>
<L>Nor is the lucid stream, nor the pure air,</L>
<L>Tho' one transparent vacancy they seem,</L>
<L N="155"><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Devoid of theirs. Even animals subsist</L>
<L>On animals, in infinite descent;</L>
<L>And all so fine adjusted, that the loss</L>
<L>Of the least species would disturb the whole.</L>
<L>Stranger than this th' inspective glass confirms</L>
<L N="160">And to the curious gives th' amazing scenes</L>
<L>Of lessening life; by WISDOM kindly hid</L>
<L>From eye, and ear of man: for if at once</L>
<L>The worlds in worlds enclos'd were push'd to light,</L>
<L>Seen by his sharpen'd eye, and by his ear</L>
<L N="165">Intensely bended heard, from the choice cate,</L>
<L>The freshest viands, and the brightest wines,</L>
<L>He'd turn abhorrent, and in dead of night,</L>
<L>When silence sleeps o'er all, be stun'd with noise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
<L>THE North-east spends his rage, and now shut up</L>
<L N="170">Within his iron caves, th' effusive South</L>
<L>Warms the wide air, and o'er the void of heaven</L>
<L>Breaths the big clouds with vernal showers distent.</L>
<L>At first a dusky wreath they seem to rise,</L>
<L>Scarce staining aether; but by fast degrees,</L>
<L N="175">In heaps on heaps, the doubling vapour sails</L>
<L>Along the loaded sky, and mingling thick</L>
<L>Sits on th' horizon round a settled gloom.</L>
<L>Not such as wintry storms on mortals shed,</L>
<L>Oppressing life, but lovely, gentle, kind,</L>
<L N="180">And full of every hope, and every joy,</L>
<L>The wish of nature. Gradual sinks the breeze</L>
<L>Into a perfect calm; that not a breath</L>
<L>Is heard to quiver thro' the closing woods,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>
Or rustling turn the many-twinkling leaves</L>
<L N="185">Of aspin tall. Th' uncurling floods, diffus'd</L>
<L>In glassy breadth, seem thro' delusive lapse</L>
<L>Forgetful of their course. 'Tis silence all,</L>
<L>And pleasing expectation. Herds and flocks</L>
<L>Drop the dry sprig, and mute-imploring eye</L>
<L N="190">The falling verdure. Hush'd in short suspense,</L>
<L>The plumy people streak their wings with oil,</L>
<L>And wait th' approaching sign to strike at once</L>
<L>Into the general choir. Even mountains, vales,</L>
<L>And forests seem, expansive, to demand</L>
<L N="195">The promis'd sweetness. Man superior walks</L>
<L>Amid the glad creation, musing praise,</L>
<L>And looking lively gratitude. At last</L>
<L>The clouds consign their treasures to the fields,</L>
<L>And, softly shaking on the dimply pool</L>
<L N="200"><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
Prelusive drops, let all their moisture flow,</L>
<L>In large effusion o'er the freshen'd world,</L>
<L>'Tis scarce to patter heard, the stealing shower,</L>
<L>By such as wander thro' the forest-walks,</L>
<L>Beneath th' umbrageous multitude of leaves.</L>
<L>But who can hold the shade, while HEAVEN descends</L>
<L N="206">In universal bounty, shedding herbs,</L>
<L>And fruits, and flowers, on NATURE's ample lap?</L>
<L>Imagination fir'd prevents their growth,</L>
<L>And while the verdant nutriment distills,</L>
<L N="210">Beholds the kindling country colour round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS all day long the full-distended clouds</L>
<L>Indulge their genial stores, and well-shower'd earth</L>
<L>Is deep enrich'd with vegetable life;</L>
<L>Till, in the western-sky, the downward sun</L>
<L N="215"><PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Looks out illustrious from amidst the flush</L>
<L>Of broken clouds, gay-shifting to his beam.</L>
<L>The rapid radiance instantaneous strikes</L>
<L>Th' illumin'd mountain thro' the forest streams,</L>
<L>Shakes on the floods, and in a yellow mist,</L>
<L N="220">Far smoaking o'er th' interminable plain,</L>
<L>In twinkling myriads lights the dewy gems.</L>
<L>Moist, bright, and green, the landskip laughs around.</L>
<L>Full swell the woods; their every musick wakes,</L>
<L>Mix'd in wild consort with the warbling brooks</L>
<L N="225">Increas'd, th'unnumber'd bleatings of the hills,</L>
<L>The hollow lows responsive from the vales,</L>
<L>Whence blending all the sweeten'd zephyr springs.</L>
<L>Mean time refracted from yon eastern cloud,</L>
<L>Bestriding earth, the grand aethereal bow</L>
<L N="230">Shoots up immense! and every hue unfolds,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="22"/>
In fair proportion running from the red,</L>
<L>To where the violet fades into the sky.</L>
<L>Here, mighty NEWTON, the dissolving clouds</L>
<L>Are, as they scatter round, thy numerous prism,</L>
<L N="235">Untwisting to the philosophic eye</L>
<L>The various twine of light, by thee pursu'd</L>
<L>Thro' the white mingling maze. Not so the swain,</L>
<L>He wondering views the bright enchantment bend,</L>
<L>Delightful, o'er the radiant fields, and runs</L>
<L N="240">To catch the falling glory; but amaz'd</L>
<L>Beholds th' amusive arch before him fly,</L>
<L>Then vanish quite away. Still night succeeds,</L>
<L>A soften'd shade, and saturated earth</L>
<L>Awaits the morning beam, to give again,</L>
<L N="245">Transmuted soon by Nature's chymistry,</L>
<L>The blooming blessings of the former day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
<L>THEN spring the living herbs, profusely wild,</L>
<L>O'er all the deep-green earth, beyond the power</L>
<L>Of BOTANIST to number up their tribes;</L>
<L N="250">Whether he steals along the lonely dale</L>
<L>In silent search; or thro' the forest, rank</L>
<L>With what the dull incurious weeds account,</L>
<L>Bursts his blind way; or climbs the mountain rock,</L>
<L>Fir'd by the nodding verdure of its brow.</L>
<L N="255">With such a liberal hand has NATURE flung</L>
<L>Their seeds abroad, blown them about in winds,</L>
<L>Innumerous mix'd them with the nursing mold,</L>
<L>The moistening current, and prolific rain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT who their virtues can declare? Who pierce</L>
<L N="260">With vision pure into these secret stores</L>
<L>Of life, and health, and joy? The food of man</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
While yet he liv'd in innocence, and told</L>
<L>A length of golden years, unflesh'd in blood,</L>
<L>A stranger to the savage arts of life,</L>
<L N="265">Death, rapine, carnage, surfeit, and disease,</L>
<L>The lord, and not the tyrant of the world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN the glad morning wak'd the gladden'd race</L>
<L>Of uncorrupted men, nor blush'd to see</L>
<L>The sluggard sleep beneath her sacred beam.</L>
<L N="270">For their light slumbers gently fum'd away,</L>
<L>And up they rose as vigorous as the sun,</L>
<L>Or to the culture of the willing glebe,</L>
<L>Or to the chearful tendance of the flock.</L>
<L>Mean time the song went round; and dance, and sport,</L>
<L N="275">Wisdom; and friendly talk successive stole</L>
<L>Their hours away. While in the rosy vale</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Love breath'd his infant sighs, from anguish free,</L>
<L>Replete with bliss, and only wept for joy.</L>
<L>Nor yet injurious act, nor surly deed</L>
<L N="280">Was known among these happy sons of heaven;</L>
<L>For reason and benevolence were law.</L>
<L>Harmonious nature too look'd smiling on.</L>
<L>Clean shone the skies, cool'd with eternal gales,</L>
<L>And balmy spirit all. The youthful sun</L>
<L N="285">Shot his best rays; and still the gracious clouds</L>
<L>Drop'd fatness down; as o'er the swelling mead</L>
<L>The herds and flocks commixing play'd secure.</L>
<L>Which when, emergent from the gloomy wood,</L>
<L>The glaring lion saw, his horrid heart</L>
<L N="290">Was meeken'd, and he join'd his sullen joy.</L>
<L>For musick held the whole in perfect peace:</L>
<L>Soft sigh'd the flute; the tender voice was heard,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
Warbling the joyous heart; the woodlands round</L>
<L>Apply'd their quire; and winds and waters flow'd</L>
<L N="295">In consonance. Such were these prime of days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS to the POETS gave the golden age;</L>
<L>When, as they sung in elevated phrase,</L>
<L>The sailor-pine had not the nations yet</L>
<L>In commerce mix'd; for every country teem'd</L>
<L N="300">With every thing. Spontaneous harvests wav'd,</L>
<L>Still in a sea of yellow plenty round.</L>
<L>The forest was the vineyard, where untaught</L>
<L>To climb, unprun'd and wild, the juicy grape</L>
<L>Burst into floods of wine. The knotted oak</L>
<L>Shook from his boughs the long transparent streams</L>
<L N="306">Of honey, creeping thro' the matted grass,</L>
<L>Th' uncultivated thorn a ruddy shower</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Of fruitage shed, on such as sat below,</L>
<L>In blooming ease, and from brown labour free,</L>
<L N="310">Save what the copious gathering, grateful gave.</L>
<L>The Rivers foam'd with nectar; or diffuse,</L>
<L>Silent, and soft, the milky maze devolv'd.</L>
<L>Nor had the spongy, full-expanded fleece,</L>
<L>Yet drunk the TYRIAN dye. The stately ram</L>
<L N="315">Shone thro' the mead, in native purple clad,</L>
<L>Or milder saffron; and the dancing lamb</L>
<L>The vivid crimson to the sun disclos'd.</L>
<L>Nothing had power to hurt the savage soul,</L>
<L>Yet untransfus'd into the tyger's heart,</L>
<L N="320">Burn'd not his bowels, nor his gamesome paw</L>
<L>Drove on the fleecy partners of his play:</L>
<L>While from the flowery brake the serpent roll'd</L>
<L>His fairer spires, and play'd his pointless tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
<L>BUT now whate'er these gaudy fables meant,</L>
<L N="325">And the white minutes which they shadow'd out,</L>
<L>Are found no more amid those iron times,</L>
<L>Those dregs of life! in which the human mind</L>
<L>Has lost that harmony ineffable,</L>
<L>Which warms the soul of happiness; and all</L>
<L N="330">Is off the poise within; the passions all</L>
<L>Have burst their bounds; and reason half extinct,</L>
<L>Or impotent, or else approving, sees</L>
<L>The foul disorder. Anger storms at large,</L>
<L>Without an equal cause; and fell revenge</L>
<L N="335">Supports the falling rage. Close envy bites</L>
<L>With venom'd tooth; while weak, unmanly fear,</L>
<L>Full of frail fancies, loosens every power.</L>
<L>Even love itself is bitterness of soul,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
A pleasing anguish pining at the heart.</L>
<L N="340">Hope sickens with extravagance; and grief,</L>
<L>Of life impatient, into madness swells;</L>
<L>Or in dead silence wastes the weeping hours.</L>
<L>These, and a thousand mix'd emotions more,</L>
<L>From ever-changing views of good and ill,</L>
<L N="345">Form'd infinitely various, vex the mind</L>
<L>With endless storm. Whence, inly-rankling, grows</L>
<L>The selfish thought, a listless inconcern,</L>
<L>Cold, and averting from our neighbour's good;</L>
<L>Then dark disgust, and malice, winding wiles,</L>
<L N="350">Sneaking deceit, and coward villany:</L>
<L>At last deep-rooted hatred, lewd reproach,</L>
<L>Convulsive wrath, and thoughtless fury, quick</L>
<L>To deeds of vilest aim. Even nature's self</L>
<L>Is deem'd, vindictive, to have chang'd her course.</L>

<L>HENCE in old time, they say, a deluge came;</L>
<L N="356">When the disparting orb of earth, that arch'd</L>
<L>Th' imprison'd deep around, impetuous rush'd,</L>
<L>With ruin inconceivable, at once</L>
<L>Into the gulph, and o'er the highest hills</L>
<L N="360">Wide-dash'd the waves, in undulation vast:</L>
<L>'Till, from the centre to the streaming clouds,</L>
<L>A shoreless ocean tumbled round the globe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE SEASONS since, as hoar TRADITION tells,</L>
<L>Have kept their constant chase; the WINTER keen</L>
<L>Pour'd out his waste of snows; and SUMMER shot</L>
<L N="365">His pestilential heats; great SPRING before</L>
<L>Green'd all the year; and fruits and blossoms blush'd</L>
<L>In social sweetness on the self-same bough.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="31"/>
Clear was the temperate air; an even calm</L>
<L>Perpetual reign'd, save what the zephyrs bland</L>
<L>Breath'd o'er the blue expanse; for then nor storms</L>
<L N="371">Were taught to blow, nor hurricanes to rage;</L>
<L>Sound slept the waters: no sulphureous glooms</L>
<L>Swell'd in the sky, and sent the lightning forth:</L>
<L>While sickly damps, and cold autumnal fogs,</L>

Of nutriment, and health, salubrious breathes,</L>

<L N="385">For, with hot ravine fir'd, ensanguin'd man</L>
<L>Is now become the lion of the plain,</L>

<L>Nor wore her warming fleece: nor has the steer,</L>
<L N="390">At whose strong chest the deadly tyger hangs,</L>
<L>E'er plow'd for him. They too are temper'd high,</L>
<L N="395">With hunger stung, and wild necessity,</L>
<L>Nor lodges pity in their shaggy breasts.</L>
<L>But MAN, whom NATURE form'd of milder clay,</L>
<L>With every kind emotion in his heart,</L>
<L>And taught alone to weep; while from her lap</L>
<L>She pours ten thousand delicacies, herbs,</L>
<L>And fruits, as numerous as the drops of rain,</L>

And beams that gave them birth: shall he, fair form!</L>
<L>Who wears sweet smiles, and looks erect on heaven,</L>

<L>'Tis true, deserves the fate in which he deals.</L>
<L N="405">Him, from the thicket, let the hardy youth</L>
<L>Provoke, and foaming thro' the awakened woods</L>
<L>With every nerve pursue. But you, ye flocks,</L>
<L>What have ye done? Ye peaceful people, what,</L>
<L>To merit death? You, who have given us milk</L>
<L N="410">In luscious streams, and lent us your own coat</L>
<L>Against the winter's cold? Whose usefulness</L>
<L>In living only lies? And the plain ox,</L>
<L>That harmless, honest, guileless animal,</L>
<L>In what has he offended? He, whose toil,</L>

<L><PB N="33" REF="34"/>
With all the pomp of harvest; shall he bleed,</L>
<L>And wrestling groan beneath the cruel hands</L>
<L>Even of the clowns he feeds? And that perhaps</L>
<L>To swell the riot of the gathering feast,</L>
<L N="420">Won by his labour? Thus the feeling heart</L>
<L>Would tenderly suggest: but 'tis enough,</L>
<L>In this late age, adventurous to have touch'd,</L>
<L>Light on the numbers of the SAMIAN sage.</L>
<L>High HEAVEN beside forbids the daring strain,</L>

Their food its insects, and its moss their nests.</L>

<L>Her sympathizing lover takes his stand</L>
<L N="620">High on th'opponent bank, and ceaseless sings</L>

<L>Th' informing gale; then steep-descending, cleaves</L>
<L N="760">The headlong torrents foaming down the hills,</L>
<L>Even where the madness of the straiten'd streams</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="57"/>
Turns in black eddies round: Such is the force</L>
<L>With which his frantick heart, and sinews swell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR, undelighted by the boundless SPRING,</L>
<L N="765">Are the broad monsters of the boiling deep:</L>
<L>From the deep ooze, and gelid cavern rous'd,</L>
<L>They flounce, and tumble in unwieldy joy.</L>
<L>Dire were the strain, and dissonant, to sing</L>
<L>The cruel raptures of the savage kind:</L>
<L N="770">How the red lioness, her whelps forgot</L>
<L>Amid the thoughtless fury of her heart;</L>
<L>The lank rapacious wolf; th' unshapely bear;</L>
<L>The spotted tyger, fellest of the fell;</L>
<L>And all the terrors of the LIBYAN swain,</L>
<L N="775">By this new flame their native wrath sublim'd,</L>
<L>Roam the resounding waste in fiercer bands,</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="58"/>
And growl their horrid loves. But this the theme</L>
<L>I sing, transported, to the BRITISH fair,</L>
<L>Forbids, and leads me to the mountain-brow,</L>
<L N="780">Where sits the shepherd on the grassy turf,</L>
<L>Inhaling, healthful, the descending sun.</L>
<L>Around him feeds his many-bleating flock</L>
<L>Of various cadence; and his sportive lambs,</L>
<L>This way, and that, convolv'd in friskful glee,</L>
<L N="785">Their little frolicks play. And now the race</L>
<L>Invites them forth; when swift the signal given,</L>
<L>They start away, and sweep the massy mound</L>
<L>That runs around the hill; the rampart once</L>
<L>Of iron war, in ancient barbarous times,</L>
<L N="790">When disunited BRITAIN ever bled,</L>
<L>Lost in eternal broil; e'er yet she grew</L>
<L>To this deep-laid, indissoluble state,</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="59"/>
Where WEALTH and COMMERCE lift their golden
head,</L>
<L>And o'er our Labours, LIBERTY and LAW</L>
<L N="795">Illustrious watch, the wonder of a world!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT is this MIGHTY BREATH, ye curious say,</L>
<L>Which, in a language rather felt than heard,</L>
<L>Instructs the fowls of heaven; and thro' their breasts</L>
<L>These arts of love diffuses? What, but GOD?</L>
<L N="800">Inspiring GOD! who boundless spirit all,</L>
<L>And unremitted energy pervades,</L>
<L>Adjusts, sustains, and agitates the whole.</L>
<L>He ceaseless works alone, and yet alone</L>
<L>Seems not to work, with such perfection fram'd</L>
<L N="805">Is this complex, amazing scheme of things.</L>
<L>But tho' conceal'd, to every purer eye</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="60"/>
Th' informing author in his work appears;</L>
<L>His grandeur in the heavens: the sun, and moon,</L>
<L>Whether that fires the day, or falling, this</L>
<L N="810">Pours out a lucid softness o'er the night,</L>
<L>Are but a beam from him. The glittering stars,</L>
<L>By the deep ear of meditation heard,</L>
<L>Still in their midnight watches sing of him.</L>
<L>He nods a calm. The tempest blows his wrath,</L>
<L N="815">Roots up the forest and o'erturns the main.</L>
<L>The thunder is his voice; and the red flash</L>
<L>His speedy sword of justice. At his touch</L>
<L>The mountains flame. He takes the solid earth,</L>
<L>And rocks the nations. Nor in these alone,</L>
<L N="820">In every common instance GOD is seen;</L>
<L>And to the man who casts his mental eye</L>
<L>Abroad unnotic'd wonders rise. But chief</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="61"/>
In thee, boon SPRING, and in thy softer scenes,</L>
<L>The SMILING GOD appears; while water, earth,</L>
<L N="825">And air attest his bounty, which instils</L>
<L>Into the brutes this temporary thought,</L>
<L>And annual melts their undesigning hearts</L>
<L>Profusely thus in tenderness, and joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>STILL let my song a nobler note assume,</L>
<L N="830">And sing th' infusive force of SPRING on man;</L>
<L>When heaven and earth, as if contending, vie</L>
<L>To raise his being, and serene his soul,</L>
<L>Can he forbear to smile with NATURE? Can</L>
<L>The stormy passions in his bosom rowl,</L>
<L N="835">While every gale is peace, and every grove</L>
<L>Is melody? Hence, from the bounteous walks</L>
<L>Of flowing SPRING, ye sordid sons of earth,</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="62"/>
Hard, and unfeeling, of another's woe,</L>
<L N="839">Or only lavish to yourselves; away.</L>
<L>But come, ye generous breasts, in whose wide thought,</L>
<L>Of all his works, CREATIVE BOUNTY, most,</L>
<L>Divinely burns; and on your open front,</L>
<L>And liberal eye, sits, from his dark retreat</L>
<L>Inviting modest want. Nor only fair,</L>
<L N="845">And easy of approach; your active search</L>
<L>Leaves no cold wintry corner unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Like silent-working HEAVEN, surprizing oft</L>
<L>The lonely heart with unexpected good.</L>
<L>For you the roving spirit of the wind</L>
<L>Blows SPRING abroad; for you the teaming clouds</L>
<L N="851">Descend in buxom plenty o'er the world;</L>
<L>And the sun spreads his genial blaze for you,</L>
<L>Ye flower of human race! In these green days,</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="63"/>
Sad-pining sickness lifts her languid head;</L>
<L N="855">Life flows afresh; and young-ey'd health exalts</L>
<L>The whole creation round. Contentment walks</L>
<L>The sunny glade, and feels an inward bliss</L>
<L>Spring o'er his mind, beyond the power of kings</L>
<L>To purchase. Pure serenity apace</L>
<L N="860">Induces thought, and contemplation still.</L>
<L>By small degrees the love of nature works,</L>
<L>And warms the bosom; till at last arriv'd</L>
<L>To rapture, and enthusiastic heat,</L>
<L>We feel the present DEITY, and taste</L>
<L N="865">The joy of GOD, to see a happy world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TIS HARMONY, that world-attuning power,</L>
<L>By which all beings are adjusted, each</L>
<L>To all around, impelling, and impell'd,</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="64"/>
In endless circulation, that inspires</L>
<L N="870">This universal smile. Thus the glad skies,</L>
<L>The wide rejoycing earth, the woods, the streams,</L>
<L>With every LIFE they hold, down to the flower</L>
<L>That paints the lowly vale, or insect-wing</L>
<L>Wav'd o'er the shepherd's slumber, touch the mind</L>
<L N="875">To nature tun'd, with a light-flying hand,</L>
<L>Invisible; quick-urging, thro' the nerves,</L>
<L>The glittering spirits in a flood of day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HENCE from the virgin's check, a fresher bloom</L>
<L>Shoots, less and less, the live carnation round;</L>
<L>Her lips blush deeper sweets; she breathes of youth;</L>
<L N="881">The shining moisture swells into her eyes,</L>
<L>In brighter flow; her wishing bosom heaves</L>
<L>With palpitations wild; kind tumults seize</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="65"/>
Her veins, and all her yielding soul is love.</L>
<L N="885">From the keen gaze her lover turns away,</L>
<L>Full of the dear ecstatic power, and sick</L>
<L>With sighing languishment. Ah then, ye fair!</L>
<L>Be greatly cautious of your sliding hearts;</L>
<L>Dare not th' infectious sigh; the pleading eye,</L>
<L N="890">In meek submission drest, deject, and low,</L>
<L>But full of tempting guile. Let not the tongue,</L>
<L>Prompt to deceive, with adulation smooth,</L>
<L>Gain on your purpos'd wills. Nor in the bower,</L>
<L>Where woodbines flaunt, and roses shed a couch,</L>
<L N="895">While evening draws her crimson curtains round,</L>
<L>Trust your soft minutes with betraying man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND let th' aspiring youth beware of love,</L>
<L>Of the smooth glance beware; for 'tis too late,</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="66"/>
When on his heart the torrent softness pours.</L>
<L N="900">Then wisdom prostrate lies; and fading fame</L>
<L>Dissolves in air away: while the fond soul</L>
<L>Is wrapt in dreams of ecstacy, and bliss;</L>
<L>Still paints th' illusive form; the kindling grace;</L>
<L>Th' inticing smile; the modest-seeming eye,</L>
<L N="905">Beneath whose beauteous beams, belying heaven,</L>
<L>Lurk searchless cunning, cruelty, and death:</L>
<L>And still, false-warbling in his cheated ear,</L>
<L>Her syren voice, enchanting, draws him on,</L>
<L>To guileful shores, and meads of fatal joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="910">EVEN present in the very lap of love</L>
<L>Inglorious laid; while musick flows around,</L>
<L>Perfumes, and oils, and wine, and wanton hours,</L>
<L>Amid the roses fierce Repentance rears</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="67"/>
Her snaky crest: a quick returning twinge</L>
<L>Shoots thro' the conscious heart; where honour still,</L>
<L N="916">And great design against th' oppressive load</L>
<L>Of luxury, by fits, impatient heave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT absent, what fantastick pangs arrous'd,</L>
<L>Rage in each thought, by restless musing fed,</L>
<L>Chill the warm cheek, and blast the bloom of life?</L>
<L N="921">Neglected fortune flies; and sliding swift,</L>
<L>Prone into ruin, fall his scorn'd affairs.</L>
<L>'Tis nought but gloom around. The darken'd sun</L>
<L>Loses his light. The rosy-bosom'd SPRING</L>
<L N="925">To weeping fancy pines; and yon bright arch</L>
<L>Of heaven, low-bends into a dusky vault.</L>
<L>All nature fades extinct; and she alone</L>
<L>Heard, felt, and seen, possesses every thought,</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="68"/>
Fills every sense, and pants in every vein.</L>
<L N="930">Books are but formal dulness, tedious Friends,</L>
<L>And sad amid the social band he sits,</L>
<L>Lonely and inattentive. From the tongue</L>
<L>Th' unfinish'd period falls: while, borne away</L>
<L>On swelling thought, his wafted spirit flies</L>
<L N="935">To the vain bosom of his distant fair;</L>
<L>And leaves the semblance of a lover, fix'd</L>
<L>In melancholy site, with head declin'd,</L>
<L>And love-dejected eyes. Sudden he starts,</L>
<L>Shook from his tender trance, and restless runs</L>
<L N="940">To glimmering shades, and sympathetick glooms,</L>
<L>Where the dun umbrage o'er the falling stream</L>
<L>Romantic hangs; there thro' the pensive dusk</L>
<L>Strays, in heart-thrilling meditation lost,</L>
<L>Indulging all to love: or on the bank</L>
<L N="945"><PB N="68" REF="69"/>
Thrown, amid drooping lillies, swells the breeze</L>
<L>With sighs unceasing, and the brook with tears.</L>
<L>Thus in soft anguish he consumes the day,</L>
<L>Nor quits his deep retirement, till the moon</L>
<L>Peeps thro' the chambers of the fleecy east,</L>
<L N="950">Enlighten'd by degrees, and in her train</L>
<L>Leads on the gentle hours; then forth he walks,</L>
<L>Beneath the trembling languish of her beams,</L>
<L>With soften'd soul, and wooes the bird of eve</L>
<L>To mingle woes with his: or while the world,</L>
<L N="955">And all the sons of care, lie hush'd in sleep,</L>
<L>Associates with the midnight shadows drear;</L>
<L>And, sighing to the lonely taper, pours</L>
<L>His idly-tortur'd heart into the page,</L>
<L>Meant for the moving messenger of love;</L>
<L N="960">Where rapture burns on rapture, every line</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="70"/>
With rising frenzy fir'd. But if on bed</L>
<L>Delirious flung, sleep from his pillow flies.</L>
<L>All night he tosses, nor the balmy power</L>
<L>In any posture finds; till the grey morn</L>
<L N="965">Lifts her pale lustre on the paler wretch,</L>
<L>Exanimate by love: and then perhaps</L>
<L>Exhausted nature sinks a while to rest,</L>
<L>Still interrupted by distracted dreams,</L>
<L>That o'er the sick imagination rise,</L>
<L N="970">And in black colours paint the mimick scene.</L>
<L>Oft with th' enchantress of his soul he talks;</L>
<L>Sometimes in crouds distress'd; or if retir'd</L>
<L>To secret-winding, flower-enwoven bowers,</L>
<L>Far from the dull impertinence of man,</L>
<L N="975">Just as he, credulous, his thousand cares</L>
<L>Begins to lose in blind oblivious love,</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="71"/>
Snatch'd from her yielded hand, he knows not how,</L>
<L>Thro' forests huge, and long untravel'd heaths</L>
<L>With desolation brown, he wanders waste,</L>
<L N="980">In night and tempest wrapt; or shrinks aghast,</L>
<L>Back, from the bending precipice; or wades</L>
<L>The turbid stream below, and strives to reach</L>
<L>The farther shore; where succourless, and sad,</L>
<L>Wild as a Bacchanal she spreads her arms,</L>
<L N="985">But strives in vain, borne by th' outragious flood</L>
<L>To distance down, he rides the ridgy wave,</L>
<L>Or whelm'd beneath the boiling eddy sinks.</L>
<L>Then a weak, wailing lamentable cry</L>
<L>Is heard, and all in tears he wakes, again</L>
<L N="990">To tread the circle of revolving woe.</L>
<L>These are the charming agonies of love,</L>
<L>Whose misery delights. But thro' the heart</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="72"/>
Should jealousy its venom once diffuse,</L>
<L>'Tis then delightful misery no more,</L>
<L N="995">But agony unmix'd, incessant rage,</L>
<L>Corroding every thought, and blasting all</L>
<L>Love's paradise. Ye fairy prospects then</L>
<L>Ye beds of roses, and ye bowers of joy,</L>
<L>Farewell! Ye gleamings of departing peace,</L>
<L>Shine out your last! the yellow tinging plague</L>
<L N="1001">Internal vision taints, and in a night</L>
<L>Of livid gloom imagination wraps.</L>
<L>Ay then instead of love-enliven'd cheeks,</L>
<L>Of funny features, and of ardent eyes</L>
<L>With flowing raptures bright, dark looks succeed,</L>
<L N="1006">Suffus'd, and glaring with untender fire,</L>
<L>A clouded aspect, and a burning cheek,</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="73"/>
Where the whole poison'd soul, malignant, sits,</L>
<L>And frightens love away. Ten thousand fears</L>
<L N="1010">Invented wild, ten thousand frantick views</L>
<L>Of horrid rivals, hanging on the charms</L>
<L>For which he melts in fondness, eat him up</L>
<L>With fervent anguish, and consuming pine.</L>
<L>In vain reproaches lend their idle aid,</L>
<L N="1015">Deceitful pride, and resolution frail,</L>
<L>Giving a moment's ease. Reflection pours,</L>
<L>Afresh, her beauties on his busy thought,</L>
<L>Her first endearments, twining round the soul,</L>
<L>With all the witchcraft of ensnaring love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="1020">Strait the fierce storm involves his mind anew,</L>
<L>Flames thro' the nerves, and boils along the veins;</L>
<L>While anxious doubt distracts the tortur'd heart;</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="74"/>
For even the sad assurance of his fears</L>
<L>Were peace to what he feels. Thus the warm youth,</L>
<L N="1025">Whom love deludes into his thorny wilds,</L>
<L>Thro' flowery-tempting paths, or leads a life</L>
<L>Of feaver'd rapture, or of cruel care;</L>
<L>His brightest aims extinguish'd all, and all</L>
<L>His lively moments running down to waste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT happy they! the happiest of their kind!</L>
<L N="1031">Whom gentler stars unite, and in one fate</L>
<L>Their hearts, their fortunes, and their beings blend.</L>
<L>'Tis not the coarser tie of human laws,</L>
<L>Unnatural oft, and foreign to the mind,</L>
<L N="1035">That binds their peace, but harmony itself,</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="75"/>
Attuning all their passions into love;</L>
<L>Where friendship full-exerts his softest power,</L>
<L>Perfect esteem enliven'd by desire</L>
<L N="1039">Ineffable, and sympathy of soul,</L>
<L>Thought meeting thought, and will preventing will,</L>
<L>With boundless confidence; for nought but love</L>
<L>Can answer love, and render bliss secure.</L>
<L>Let him, ungenerous, who, alone intent</L>
<L>To bless himself, from sordid parents buys</L>
<L N="1045">The loathing virgin, in eternal care,</L>
<L>Well-merited, consume his nights and days:</L>
<L>Let barbarous nations, whose inhuman love</L>
<L>Is wild desire, fierce as the suns they feel;</L>
<L>Let eastern tyrants from the light of heaven</L>
<L N="1050">Seclude their bosom-slaves, meanly possess'd</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="76"/>
Of a meer, lifeless, violated form:</L>
<L>While those whom love cements, in holy faith,</L>
<L>And equal transport, free as nature, live,</L>
<L>Disdaining fear; for what's the world to them,</L>
<L N="1055">Its pomp, its pleasure, and its nonsense all!</L>
<L>Who in each other clasp whatever fair</L>
<L>High fancy forms, and lavish hearts can wish,</L>
<L>Something than beauty dearer, should they look</L>
<L>Or on the mind, or mind-illumin'd face,</L>
<L N="1060">Truth, goodness, honour, harmony, and love,</L>
<L>The richest bounty of indulgent HEAVEN.</L>
<L>Mean-time a smiling Offspring rises round,</L>
<L>And mingles both their graces. By degrees,</L>
<L>The human blossom blows; and every day,</L>
<L N="1065">Soft as it rolls along, shews some new charm,</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="77"/>
The father's lustre, and the mother's bloom.</L>
<L>Then infant reason grows apace, and calls</L>
<L>For the kind hand of an assiduous care:</L>
<L>Delightful task! to rear the tender thought,</L>
<L N="1070">To teach the young idea how to shoot,</L>
<L>To pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind,</L>
<L>To breathe th' inspiring spirit, and to plant</L>
<L>The generous purpose in the glowing breast.</L>
<L>Oh speak the joy! you whom the sudden tear</L>
<L N="1075">Surprizes often, while you look around,</L>
<L>And nothing strikes your eye but sights of bliss,</L>
<L>All various nature pressing on the heart,</L>
<L>Obedient fortune, and approving HEAVEN.</L>
<L>These are the blessings of diviner love;</L>
<L N="1080">And thus their moments fly. The seasons thus,</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="78"/>
As ceaseleless round a jarring world they roll,</L>
<L>Still find them happy; and consenting SPRING</L>
<L>Sheds her own rosy garland on their head:</L>
<L>Till evening comes at last, cool, gentle, calm;</L>
<L N="1085">When after the long vernal day of life,</L>
<L>Enamour'd more, as soul approaches soul,</L>
<L>Together, down they sink in social sleep.</L>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The subject propos'd. Invocation. Address to Mr.
<HI>DODINGTON.</HI> An introductory reflection on
the motion of the heavenly bodies; whence the
succession of the <HI>SEASONS.</HI> As the face of na∣ture

of the poem is a description of a sum∣mer's
day. Morning. A view of the sun-rising.
Hymn to the sun. Forenoon. Rural
prospects. Summer infects describ'd. Noon-day.
A woodland retreat. A groupe of flocks
and herds. A solemn grove. How it affects
a contemplative mind. Transition to the pro∣spect
of a rich well-cultivated country; which
introduces a panegyric on <HI>GREAT-BRITAIN.</HI>
A digression on foreign summers. Storm of
thunder and lightning. A tale. The storm
over; a serene afternoon. Bathing. Sun-set.
Evening. The whole concluding with the praise
of Philosophy.</P>

<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>ROM yonder fields of aether fair disclos'd,</L>
<L>Child of the Sun! illustrious <HI>Summer</HI> comes</L>
<L>In pride of youth, and felt thro' Nature's depth.</L>
<L>He comes, attended by the fultry <HI>Hours,</HI></L>
<L N="5">And ever-fanning <HI>Breezes,</HI> on his way;</L>
<L>While, from his ardent look, the turning <HI>Spring</HI></L>
<L>Averts her blushful face; and earth, and skies,</L>
<L>All-smiling, to his hot dominion leaves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence, let me haste into the mid-wood shade,</L>
<L N="10">Where scarce a sun-beam wanders thro' the gloom;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="86"/>
And on the dark-green grass, beside the brink</L>
<L>Of haunted stream that by the roots of oak</L>
<L>Rowls o'er the rocky channel, lie at large,</L>
<L>And sing the glories of the circling <HI>year.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="15">Come, <HI>Inspiration!</HI> from thy hermit seat</L>
<L>By mortal seldom found: may fancy dare,</L>
<L>From thy fix'd serious muse, and raptur'd eye</L>
<L>Shot on surrounding heaven, to steal one look,</L>
<L>Creative of the poet, every power</L>
<L N="20">Exalting to an extasy of soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thou, the muse's honour! and her friend!</L>
<L>In whom the human graces all unite:</L>
<L>Pure light of mind, and tenderness of heart;</L>
<L>Genius, and wisdom; the gay social sense,</L>
<L N="25">By decency chastiz'd; goodness and wit,</L>
<L>In seldom-meeting harmony combin'd;</L>
<L>Unblemish'd honour, and an active zeal,</L>

<L>O <HI>Dodington!</HI> attend my rural song,</L>

Stoop to my theme, inspirit every line,</L>
<L>And teach me to deserve thy best applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With what a perfect world-revolving power</L>
<L>Were first th' unwieldy planets launch'd along</L>
<L>Th' illimitable void! Thus to remain,</L>
<L N="35">Amid the flux of many thousand years,</L>
<L>That oft has swept the busy race of men,</L>
<L>And all their labour'd monuments away,</L>
<L>Unresting, changless, matchless, in their course;</L>
<L>To night and day, with the delightful round</L>
<L N="40">Of <HI>Seasons,</HI> faithful; not excentric once:</L>

<L>When now no more th' alternate <HI>Twins</HI> are fir'd,</L>

<L>Short is the doubtful empire of the night;</L>
<L N="45">And soon, observant of approaching day,</L>

<L>At first faint-gleaming in the dappled east:</L>
<L>Till far o'er aether shoots the trembling glow;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="88"/>
And, from before the lustre of her face,</L>
<L N="50">White break the clouds away. With tardy step,</L>
<L>Brown night retires. Young day pours in apace,</L>
<L>And opens all the lawny prospect wide.</L>
<L>The dripping rock, the mountain's misty top</L>
<L>Swell on the eye, and brighten with the dawn.</L>
<L N="55">Blue thro' the dusk the smoaking currents shine;</L>
<L>And from the bladed field the fearful hare</L>
<L>Limps aukward; while along the forest glade</L>
<L>The wild deer trip, and often turning gaze</L>
<L>At early passenger. Musick awakes,</L>
<L N="60">The native voice of undissembled joy;</L>
<L>And thick around the woodland hymns arise.</L>
<L>Rous'd by the cock, the soon-clad shepherd leaves</L>
<L>His mossy cottage, where with <HI>Peace</HI> he dwells;</L>
<L>And from the crowded fold in order drives</L>
<L N="65">His flock, to taste the verdure of the morn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Falsly luxurious, will not man awake,</L>
<L>And, starting from the bed of sloth, enjoy</L>
<L>The cool, the fragrant, and the silent hour,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="89"/>
To meditation due, and sacred song.</L>
<L N="70">And is there ought in sleep can charm the wise?</L>
<L>To lie in dead oblivion, losing half</L>
<L>The fleeting moments of too short a life?</L>
<L>Total extinction of th' enlighten'd soul!</L>
<L>Or else to feverish vanity alive,</L>
<L N="75">Wilder'd, and tossing thro' distemper'd dreams?</L>
<L>Who would in such a gloomy state remain,</L>
<L>Longer than nature craves; when every Muse,</L>

<L>To bless the wildy-devious morning walk?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="80">But yonder comes the powerful king of day,</L>

<L>Tipt with aetherial gold, his near approach</L>
<L>Betoken glad: and now apparent all,</L>
<L N="85">Aslant the dew-bright earth, and colour'd air,</L>

<L>And sheds the shining day, that burnish'd plays</L>

High-gleaming from afar. Prime chearer Light!</L>

<L>Without whose vesting beauty all were wrapt</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis by thy secret, strong, attractive force,</L>

<PB N="9" REF="91"/>
<L>Informer of the planetary train!</L>
<L>Without whose vital and effectual glance,</L>
<L>They wou'd be brute, uncomfortable mass,</L>
<L>And not as now the green abodes of life!</L>
<L N="110">How many forms of being wait on thee!</L>
<L>Inhaling gladness; from th' unfetter'd mind,</L>
<L>By thee sublim'd, to that day-living race,</L>
<L>The mixing myriads of thy setting beam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The vegetable world is also thine,</L>
<L N="115">Parent of <HI>Seasons!</HI> from whose rich-stain'd rays,</L>
<L>Reflected various, various colours rise:</L>
<L>The freshening mantle of the youthful year;</L>
<L>The wild embroidery of the watry vale;</L>
<L>With all that chears the sense, and charms the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="120">The branching grove thy lusty product stands,</L>
<L>Diffus'd, and deep; to quench the summer noon,</L>
<L>And crowd a shade for the retreating swain,</L>
<L>When on his russet fields you look direct.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="92"/>
<L>Fruit is thy bounty too, with Juice replete,</L>
<L N="125">Acid, or mild; and from thy ray receives</L>

<L>By thee concocted blushes; and, by thee</L>
<L>Fully matur'd, into the verdant lap</L>
<L>Of <HI>Industry</HI> the mellow plenty falls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="130">Extensive harvests wave at thy command;</L>
<L>And the bright ear, consolidate by thee,</L>

<LG>
<L>Even <HI>Winter</HI> speaks thy power; whose every blast,</L>
<L>O'ercast with tempest, or severely sharp</L>
<L N="135">With breathing frost, is eloquent of thee,</L>
<L>And makes us languish for thy vernal gleams.</L>
<L>Shot to the bowels of the teeming earth,</L>

<L>Hence Labour draws his tools; hence waving War</L>

<L>Th' unfruitful rock itself impregn'd by thee,</L>

<L>Collected light, compact; that polish'd bright,</L>

<L>Shines proudly on the bosoms of the fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At thee the ruby lights his deepening glow,</L>
<L N="150">A bleeding radiance, grateful to the view.</L>
<L>From thee the saphire, solid aether, takes</L>
<L>His hue cerulean; and, of evening tinct,</L>
<L>The purple-streaming amethyst is thine.</L>
<L>With thy own smile the yellow topaz burns.</L>
<L N="155">Nor deeper verdure dies the robe of Spring,</L>
<L>When first she gives it to the southern gale,</L>
<L>Than the green emerald shows. But, all combin'd,</L>
<L>Thick thro' the whitening opal play thy beams;</L>
<L>Or, flying several from its surface, form</L>

<PB N="12" REF="94"/>
<L>The very dead creation, from thy touch,</L>
<L>Assumes a mimic life. By thee refin'd,</L>

<L>Projecting horror on the blacken'd flood,</L>
<L>Softens at thy return. The desart joys</L>
<L>Wildly, thro' all his melancholy bounds.</L>
<L>Rude ruins glitter; and the briny deep,</L>
<L N="170">Seen from some pointed promontory's top,</L>
<L>Reflects, from every fluctuating wave,</L>
<L>A glance extensive as the day. But these,</L>
<L>And all the much transported muse can sing,</L>

<L>How shall I then attempt to sing of him,</L>

<L N="185">And all th' extinguish'd stars, would loosening reel,</L>
<L>Wide from their spheres, and chaos come again.</L>

<LG>
<L>And yet, was every faultering tongue of man,</L>
<L><HI>Almighty Poet!</HI> silent in thy praise;</L>
<L>Thy matchless works in each exalted line,</L>

<L>In party-colour'd bands; till all unveil'd</L>
<L>The face of nature shines, from where earth seems,</L>
<L N="205">Far-stretch'd around, to meet the bending sphere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Half in a blush of clustering roses lost,</L>
<L>Dew-dropping coolness to the shade retires;</L>
<L>And tyrant heat, dispreading thro' the sky,</L>

<L N="210">On man, and beast, and herb, and tepid stream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who can unpitying see the flowery race,</L>

<L>Home, from his morning task, the swain retreats;</L>
<L N="220">His flock before him stepping to the fold:</L>
<L>While the full-udder'd mother lows around</L>
<L>The chearful cottage then expecting food,</L>
<L>The food of innocence, and health! The daw,</L>
<L>The rook and magpie, to the grey-grown oaks</L>
<L N="225">(That the calm village, in their verdant arms,</L>

<L>Where on the mingling boughs they sit embower'd,</L>
<L>All the hot noon, till cooler hours arise.</L>
<L>Faint, underneath, the homely fowls convene;</L>
<L N="230">And, in a corner of the buzzing shade,</L>

<L>Attacks the nightly thief, and one exults</L>
<L>O'er hill and dale; till, waken'd by the wasp,</L>
<L N="235">They bootless snap. Nor shall the muse disdain</L>
<L>To let the little noisy summer-race</L>
<L>Live in her lay, and flutter thro' her song,</L>
<L>Not mean, tho' simple; to the sun ally'd,</L>

<L N="240">Wak'd by his warmer ray, the reptile young</L>

<L>And secret corner, where they slept away</L>
<L>The wintry glooms, by myriads, all at once,</L>
<L N="245">Swarming, they pour: green, speckled, yellow, grey,</L>
<L>Black, azure, brown; more than th' assisted eye</L>

<L>Ten thousand forms! Ten thousand different tribes!</L>
<L>People the blaze. To sunny waters some</L>

<L>Often beguil'd. Some thro' the green-wood glade</L>

<L N="255">In the fresh leaf. Luxurious, others make</L>
<L>The meads their choice, and visit every flower,</L>
<L>And every latent herb; but careful still</L>
<L>To shun the mazes of the sounding bee,</L>
<L>As o'er the blooms he sweeps. Some to the house,</L>

Sip round the pail, or taste the curdling cheese:</L>

The thunder raises his tremendous voice;</L>
<L>At first low-muttering; but at each approach,</L>

<L N="855">The noise astounds: till over head a sheet</L>

He dies; and, like a statue grim'd with age,</L>

<L>His russet sing'd, and rent his hanging hat;</L>
<L N="875">Against his crook his sooty cheek reclin'd;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Guilt dubious hears, with deeply-troubled thought;</L>
<L N="895">And yet not always on the guilty head</L>
<L>Falls the devoted flash. Young <HI>Celadon</HI></L>

<L>They lov'd. But such their guileless passion was,</L>
<L>As in the dawn of time alarm'd the heart</L>
<L N="904">Of <HI>Innocence,</HI> and undissembling <HI>Truth.</HI></L>
<L>'Twas friendship, heighten'd by the mutual wish,</L>
<L>Th' enchanting hope, and sympathetick glow,</L>
<L>Struck from the charmsul eye. Devoting all</L>
<L>To love, each was to each a dearer self;</L>
<L>Supremely happy in th' awaken'd power</L>
<L N="910">Of given joy. Alone, amid the shades,</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="132"/>
Still in harmonious intercourse they liv'd</L>
<L>The rural day, and talk'd the flowing heart,</L>
<L>Or sigh'd, and look'd unutterable things.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus pass'd their life, a clear united stream,</L>
<L N="915">By care unrnffled; till in evil hour</L>
<L>The tempest caught them on the tender walk,</L>

<L>In vain assuring love, and confidence</L>

<L>Her frame near dissolution. He perceiv'd</L>
<L>Th' unequal conflict, and as angels look</L>
<L N="925">On dying saints, his eyes compassion shed,</L>
<L>With love illumin'd high. " Fear not, he said,</L>

"That wastes at midnight, or th' undreaded hour</L>

<L N="935">" 'Tis safety to be near thee sure, and thus</L>

<L>But who can paint the lover, as he stood,</L>

<L>As from the face of heaven the shatter'd clouds</L>

Diffusive, tremble; while, as if in sign</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L N="955">'Tis beauty all, and grateful song around,</L>
<L>Joyn'd to the low of kine, and numerous bleat</L>

<L>Gazing th' inverted landskip, half afraid</L>

To meditate the blue profound below;</L>
<L>Then plunges headlong down the circling flood.</L>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The subject propos'd. Address to Mr. <HI>ONSLOW.</HI>
A prospect of the fields ready for harvest.
Reaping. A tale. A harvest storm. Shooting
and hunting, their barbarity. A ludicrous
account of fox-hunting. A view of an orchard.
Wall-fruit. A vineyard. A description of
fogs, frequent in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> part of <HI>AUTUMN</HI>:
whence a digression, enquiring into the rise of
fountains, and rivers. Birds of season consi∣dered,
that now shift their habitation. The
prodigious number of them that cover the nor∣thern
and western isles of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> Hence
a view of the country. A prospect of the
dIscoloured, fading woods. After a gentle
dusky day, moon-light. Autumnal meteors.
Morning: to which succeeds a calm, pure,
sun-shiNe day, such as usually shuts up the
season. The harvest being gathered in, the
country dissolv'd in joy. The whole concludes
with a panegyric on a philosophical country
life.</P>

<L>When the bright <HI>Virgin</HI> gives the beauteous days,</L>
<L N="24">And <HI>Libra</HI> weighs in equal scales the year;</L>
<L>From heaven's high cope the fierce effulgence shook</L>
<L>Of parting <HI>Summer,</HI> a serener blue,</L>

With golden light irradiate, wide invests</L>
<L N="28">The happy world. Attemper'd suns arise,</L>
<L>Sweet-beam'd, and shedding oft thro' lucid clouds</L>
<L>A pleasing calm; while broad, and brown, below,</L>
<L>Unbounded harvests hang the heavy head.</L>
<L>Rich, silent, deep, they stand; for not a gale</L>
<L>Rolls its light billows o'er the bending plain;</L>
<L>A calm of plenty! till the ruffled air</L>
<L>Falls from its poise, and gives the breeze to blow.</L>
<L N="36">Rent is the fleecy mantle of the sky;</L>
<L>The clouds fly different; and the sudden sun</L>

<L N="40">A gayly checker'd, wide-extended view,</L>

<L>Convolv'd, and tossing in a flood of corn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These are thy blessings <HI>Industry!</HI> rough Power!</L>
<L>Whom Labour still attends, and Sweat, and Pain;</L>
<L N="45">Yet the kind source of every gentle art,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="156"/>
And all the soft civility of life:</L>
<L>Raiser of human kind! by <HI>Nature</HI> cast,</L>
<L>Naked, and helpless, out amid the woods,</L>
<L>And wilds, to rude inclement elements;</L>
<L N="50">With various powers of deep efficiency</L>
<L>Implanted, and profusely pour'd around</L>
<L>Materials infinite; but idle all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still unexerted, in th' unconscious breast,</L>
<L>Slept the lethargic powers; Corruption still,</L>
<L N="55">Voracious, swallow'd what the liberal hand</L>

<L>And still the sad barbarian, roving, mix'd</L>
<L>With beasts of prey; or for his acron-meal</L>
<L>Fought the fierce tusky boar: a shivering wretch!</L>
<L N="60">Aghast, and comfortless, when the red north,</L>
<L>With winter charg'd, let the mixt tempest fly,</L>
<L>Hail, rain, and snow, and bitter-breathing frost.</L>
<L>Then to the shelter of the hut he fled;</L>
<L>And the wild season, sordid, pin'd away.</L>
<L N="65">For home he had not; home is the resort</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="157"/>
Of love, of joy, of peace, and plenty, where,</L>
<L>Supporting and supported, polish'd friends,</L>

<L N="70">Even desolate in crouds; and thus his days</L>
<L>Roll'd heavy, dark, and unenjoy'd along;</L>
<L>A waste of time! till <HI>Industry</HI> approach'd,</L>
<L>And rous'd him from his miserable sloth;</L>
<L>His faculties unfolded; pointed out,</L>
<L N="80">Where lavish <HI>Nature</HI> the directing hand</L>
<L>Of <HI>Art</HI> demanded; shew'd him how to raise</L>
<L>His feeble force by the mechanic powers,</L>
<L>To dig the mineral from the vaulted earth,</L>
<L>On what to turn the piercing rage of fire,</L>
<L N="85">On what the torrent, and the gather'd blast;</L>
<L>Gave the tall antient forest to his ax;</L>
<L>Taught him to chip the wood, and hew the stone,</L>
<L>Till by degrees the finish'd fabric rose;</L>
<L>Tore from his limbs the blood-polluted fur,</L>
<L N="90">And wrapt them in the woolly vestment warm,</L>

Or bright in glossy silk, and flowing lawn;</L>

<L>The life-refining soul of decent wit:</L>
<L N="95">Nor stopp'd at barren, bare necessity;</L>
<L>But still advancing bolder, led him on,</L>
<L>By hardy patience, and experience slow,</L>
<L>To pomp, to pleasure, elegance, and grace;</L>
<L>And breathing high ambition thro' his soul,</L>
<L N="100">Set science, wisdom, glory in his view,</L>
<L>And bad him be the <HI>Lord</HI> of all below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then gathering men their natural powers combin'd,</L>

<L>Submitting, aiming, and conducting all.</L>
<L N="105">For this the <HI>Patriot-Council</HI> met, the full,</L>

<L N="110"><PB N="11" REF="159"/>
<HI>Imperial Justice</HI> at the helm; yet still</L>
<L>To them accountable: nor slavish dream'd</L>
<L>That toiling millions must resign their weal,</L>
<L>And all the honey of their search, to such</L>
<L>As for themselves alone themselves have rais'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="115">Hence every form of cultivated life</L>
<L>In order set, protected, and inspir'd,</L>
<L>Into perfection wrought. Uniting all,</L>
<L>Society grew numerous, high, polite,</L>
<L N="119">And happy. Nurse of art! the city rose;</L>
<L>And stretching street on street by thousands led,</L>
<L>From twining woody haunts, and the tough yew</L>
<L>To bows strong-straining, her aspiring sons.</L>
<L>'Twas nought but labour, the whole dusky groupe</L>
<L>Of clustering houses, and of mingling men,</L>
<L N="125">Restless design, and execution strong.</L>
<L>In every street the sounding hammer ply'd</L>
<L>His massy task; while the corrosive file,</L>
<L>In flying touches, form'd the fine machine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="160"/>
<L>Then <HI>Commerce</HI> brought into the public walk</L>
<L N="130">The busy Merchant; the big ware-house built;</L>
<L>Rais'd the strong crane; choak'd up the loaded street</L>
<L>With foreign plenty; and on thee, thou <HI>Thames,</HI></L>
<L>Large, gentle, deep, majestic, king of floods!</L>
<L>Than whom no river heaves a fuller tide,</L>
<L N="135">Seiz'd for his grand resort. On either hand,</L>
<L>Like a long wintry forest, groves of masts</L>
<L>Shot up their spires; the bellying sheet between</L>
<L>Possess'd the breezy void; the sooty hulk</L>
<L>Steer'd sluggish on; the splendid barge along</L>
<L N="140">Row'd, regular, to harmony; around,</L>
<L>The boat, light-skimming, stretch'd its oary wings;</L>
<L>While deep the various voice of fervent toil</L>
<L>From bank to bank increas'd; whence ribb'd with oak,</L>
<L>To bear the <HI>British</HI> thunder, black, and bold,</L>
<L N="145">The roaring vessel rush'd into the main.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="161"/>
<L>Then too the pillar'd dome, magnific, heav'd</L>
<L>His ample roof; and <HI>Luxury</HI> within</L>
<L>Pour'd out her glittering stores. The canvas smooth,</L>
<L>With glowing life protuberant, to the view</L>
<L>Embodied rose. The statue seem'd to breathe,</L>
<L N="151">And soften into flesh, beneath the touch</L>
<L>Of forming art, imagination-flush'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All is the gift of <HI>Industry</HI>; whate'er</L>
<L>Exalts, embellishes, and renders life</L>
<L N="155">Delightful. Pensive <HI>Winter</HI> chear'd by him</L>
<L>Sits at the social fire, and happy hears</L>
<L>Th' excluded tempest idly rave along.</L>
<L>His harden'd fingers deck the gaudy <HI>Spring.</HI></L>
<L>Without him <HI>Summer</HI> were an arid waste;</L>
<L>Nor to th' <HI>autumnal</HI> months could thus transmit</L>

<PB N="14" REF="162"/>
<L>Soon as the morning trembles o'er the sky,</L>
<L>And, unperceiv'd, unfolds the spreading day;</L>
<L>Before the ripen'd field the reapers stand,</L>
<L N="165">In fair array; each by the lass he loves,</L>
<L>To bear the rougher part, and mitigate</L>
<L>By nameless gentle offices her toil.</L>
<L>At once they stoop, and swell the lusty sheaves;</L>
<L>While, bandied round and round, the rural talk,</L>
<L N="171">The rural scandal, and the rural jest</L>
<L>Fly hearty, to deceive the tedious time,</L>
<L>And chearly steal the sultry hours away.</L>
<L>Behind the master walks, builds up the shocks;</L>
<L N="175">And, conscious, glancing oft this way and that</L>
<L>His sated eye, feels his heart heave with joy.</L>
<L>The gleaners spread around, and here and there,</L>
<L>Spike after spike, their sparing harvest pick.</L>
<L>Be not too narrow, husband-men! but fling</L>
<L N="180">From the full sheaf, with charitable stealth,</L>
<L>The liberal handful. Think, oh grateful think!</L>

How good the <HI>God</HI> of harvest is to you;</L>
<L>Who pours abundance o'er your flowing fields;</L>
<L N="184">While these unhappy partners of your kind</L>
<L>Wide-hover round you, like the fowls of heaven,</L>

<L>The lovely young <HI>Lavinia</HI> once had friends;</L>
<L N="190">And fortune smil'd, deceitful, on her birth.</L>
<L>For in her helpless years depriv'd of all,</L>

<L>She with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,</L>
<L>And poor, liv'd in a cottage, lost far up</L>
<L N="195">Amid the windings of a woody vale;</L>
<L>Safe from the cruel, blasting arts of man;</L>
<L>Almost on <HI>Nature</HI>'s common bounty fed,</L>
<L>Like the gay birds that sung them to repose,</L>
<L>Content, and careless of to-morrow's fare.</L>
<L N="200">Her form was fresher than the morning-rose,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="164"/>
When the dew wets its leaves; unstain'd, and pure,</L>
<L>As is the lilly, or the mountain snow.</L>
<L>The modest virtues mingled in her eyes,</L>
<L>Still on the ground deject, and darting all</L>
<L>Their humid beams into the blooming flowers:</L>
<L N="206">Or when the stories that her mother told,</L>
<L>Of what her faithless fortune flatter'd once,</L>
<L>Thrill'd in her thought, they, like the dewy star</L>
<L>Of evening, shone in tears. A native grace</L>
<L N="210">Sat fair-proportion'd on her polish'd limbs,</L>
<L>Veil'd in a simple robe; for loveliness</L>
<L>Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,</L>
<L>But is when unadorn'd adorn'd the most.</L>
<L>Thoughtless of beauty, she was beauty's self,</L>
<L N="215">Recluse among the woods; if city-dames</L>
<L>Will deign their faith. And thus she went compell'd</L>
<L>By strong necessity, with as serene,</L>
<L>And pleas'd a look as patience can put on,</L>
<L>To glean <HI>Palaemon</HI>'s fields. The pride of swains</L>
<L N="220"><HI>Palaemon</HI> was, the generous, and the rich,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="165"/>
Who led the rural life in all its joy,</L>
<L>And elegance, such as <HI>Arcadian</HI> song</L>
<L>Transmits from antient, incorrupted times;</L>
<L>When tyrant custom had not shackled man,</L>
<L N="225">And free to follow nature was the mode.</L>
<L>He then, his fancy with autumnal scenes</L>
<L>Amusing, chanc'd beside his reaper-train</L>

<L>Unconscious of her power, and turning quick</L>
<L N="230">With unaffected blushes from his gaze.</L>
<L>He saw her charming, but he saw not half</L>
<L>The charms her down-cast modesty conceal'd.</L>
<L>That very moment love and chast desire</L>
<L>Sprung in his bosom, to himself unknown;</L>
<L>For still the world prevail'd, and its dread laugh</L>
<L N="236">Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn,</L>
<L>Should his heart own a gleaner in the field:</L>
<L>And thus in secret to his soul he sigh'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="166"/>
<L>What pity! that so delicate a form,</L>
<L N="240">By beauty kindled, and harmonious shap'd,</L>
<L>Where sense sincere, and goodness seem'd to dwell,</L>
<L>Should be devoted to the rude embrace</L>
<L>Of some indecent clown? She looks, methinks,</L>
<L>Of old <HI>Acasto</HI>'s line; and to my mind</L>
<L N="245">Recalls that patron of my happy life,</L>
<L>From whom my liberal fortune took its rise;</L>
<L>Now to the dust gone down; his houses, lands,</L>
<L>And once fair-spreading family dissolv'd.</L>
<L>I've heard that, in some waste obscure retreat,</L>

<L>Far from those scenes which knew their better days,</L>
<L>His aged widow and his daughter live;</L>

<L>Romantic wish, would this the daughter were!</L>

Heard the winds roar, and the big torrent burst;</L>

<LG>
<L>To thee, the patron of her first essay,</L>
<L>The muse, O <HI>Wilmington!</HI> renews her song.</L>
<L>Since has she rounded the revolving <HI>Year</HI>;</L>
<L N="20">Skim'd the gay <HI>Spring</HI>; on eagle-pinions borne,</L>
<L>Attempted thro' the <HI>Summer</HI>-blaze to rise;</L>
<L>Then swept o'er <HI>Autumn</HI> with the shadowy gale,</L>
<L>And now among the <HI>Wintry</HI> clouds again,</L>
<L>Roll'd in the doubling storm, she tries to soar;</L>
<L N="25">To swell her note with all the rushing winds;</L>
<L>To suit her sounding cadence to the floods;</L>
<L>As is her theme, her numbers wildly great:</L>
<L>Thrice happy! could she fill thy judging ear</L>
<L>With bold description, and with manly thought.</L>
<L>For thee the Graces smooth; thy softer thoughts</L>
<L N="31">The Muses tune; nor art thou skill'd alone</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="226"/>
In awful schemes, the management of states,</L>
<L>And how to make a mighty people thrive:</L>
<L>But equal goodness; sound integrity;</L>
<L N="35">A firm, unshaken, uncorrupted soul,</L>
<L>Amid a sliding age; and burning strong,</L>
<L>Not vainly blazing, for thy country's weal,</L>
<L>A steady spirit, regularly free;</L>
<L>These, each exalting each, the statesman light</L>
<L N="40">Into the patriot; and, the publick hope</L>
<L>And eye to thee converting, bid the muse</L>
<L>Record what envy dares not flattery call.</L>

<LG>
<L>When <HI>Scorpio</HI> gives to <HI>Capricorn</HI> the sway,</L>
<L>And fierce <HI>Aquarius</HI> fouls th' inverted year;</L>
<L N="45">Retiring to the verge of heaven, the sun</L>
<L>Scarce spreads o'er other the dejected day.</L>
<L>Faint are his gleams, and ineffectual shoot</L>
<L>His struggling rays, in horizontal lines,</L>
<L>Thro' the thick air; as at dull distance seen,</L>
<L>Weak, wan, and broad, he skirts the southern sky;</L>
<L N="51">And, soon descending, to the long dark night,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="227"/>
Wide-shading all, the prostrate world resigns.</L>
<L>Nor is the night unwish'd; while vital heat,</L>
<L>Light, life, and joy the dubious day forsake.</L>
<L N="55">Mean-time, in sable cincture, shadows vast,</L>
<L>Deep-ting'd, and damp, and congregated clouds,</L>
<L>And all the vapoury turbulence of Heaven</L>
<L>Involve the face of things. Thus <HI>Winter</HI> falls,</L>
<L>A heavy gloom oppressive o'er the world,</L>
<L N="60">Thro' nature shedding influence malign,</L>
<L>And rouses all the seeds of dark disease.</L>
<L>The soul of man dies in him, loathing life,</L>
<L>And black with horrid views. The cattle droop</L>
<L>The conscious head; and o'er the furrow'd land,</L>
<L>Red from the plow, the dun discolour'd flocks,</L>
<L N="66">Untended spreading, crop the wholesome root.</L>
<L>Along the woods, along the moorish fens.</L>
<L>Sighs the sad genius of the coming storm;</L>
<L>And up among the loose, disjointed cliffs,</L>
<L>And fractur'd mountains wild, the brawling brook,</L>
<L>And cave, presageful, send a hollow moan,</L>
<L>Resounding long in listening fancy's ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="228"/>
<L>Then comes the father of the tempest forth,</L>
<L N="74">Striding the gloomy blast. First rains obscure</L>
<L>Drive thro' the mingling skies with vapour vile;</L>
<L>Dash on the mountain's brow, and shake the woods,</L>
<L>That grumbling wave below. Th' unsightly plain</L>
<L>Lies a brown deluge; as the low-bent clouds</L>
<L>Pour flood on flood, yet unexhausted still</L>
<L N="80">Combine, and deepening into night shut up</L>
<L>The day's fair face. The wanderers of heaven,</L>
<L>Each to his home, retire; save those that love</L>
<L>To take their pastime in the troubled air,</L>
<L>Or skimming flutter round the dimply pool.</L>
<L N="85">The Cattle from th' untasted fields return,</L>
<L>And ask, with meaning lowe, their wonted stalls,</L>
<L>Or ruminate in the contiguous shade.</L>
<L>Thither the houshold, feathery people crowd,</L>
<L N="89">The crested cock, with all his female train,</L>
<L>Pensive, and wet. Mean-while the cottage-swain</L>
<L>Hangs o'er th' enlivening blaze, and taleful there</L>
<L>Recounts his simple frolick: much he talks.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="229"/>
And much he laughs, nor recks the storm that blows</L>
<L>Without, and rattles on his humble roof.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wide o'er the brim, with many a torrent swell'd,</L>
<L N="96">And the mix'd ruins of its banks o'erspread,</L>
<L>At last the rous'd-up river pours along,</L>
<L>Resistless, roaring; dreadful down it comes</L>
<L>From the chapt mountain, and the mossy wild,</L>
<L>Tumbling thro' rocks abrupt, and sounding far;</L>
<L N="101">Then o'er the sanded valley floating spreads,</L>
<L>Calm, sluggish, silent; till again constrain'd,</L>
<L>Betwixt two meeting hills it bursts away,</L>
<L>Where rocks, and woods o'erhang the turbid stream;</L>
<L N="105">There gathering triple force, rapid, and deep,</L>
<L>It boils, and wheels, and foams, and thunders thro'.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Nature!</HI> great parent! whose continual hand</L>
<L>Rolls round the seasons of the changeful year,</L>
<L>How mighty, how majestie are thy works!</L>
<L>With what a pleasing dread they swell the soul!</L>
<L N="111">That sees astonish'd! and astonish'd sings!</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="230"/>
Ye too, ye winds! that now begin to blow,</L>
<L>With boisterous sweep, I raise my voice to you.</L>
<L>Where are your stores, ye subtil beings! say,</L>
<L N="115">Where your aerial magazines reserv'd,</L>
<L>Against the day of tempest perilous?</L>
<L>In what far-distant region of the sky,</L>
<L>Hush'd in dead silence, sleep you when 'tis calm?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Late in the lowring sky, red, fiery streaks</L>
<L N="120">Begin to flush about; the reeling clouds</L>
<L>Stagger with dizzy poise, as doubting yet</L>
<L>Which master to obey: while rising slow,</L>
<L>Blank in the leaden-colour'd east, the moon</L>
<L>Wears a wan circle round her sully'd orb.</L>
<L N="125">The stars obtuse emit a shivering ray;</L>
<L>Snatch'd in short eddies plays the fluttering straw;</L>
<L>Loud shrieks the soaring hern; and, skreaming wild,</L>
<L>The circling sea-fowl rise; while from the shore,</L>
<L>Eat into caverns by the restless wave,</L>
<L N="130">And forest-rustling mountain, comes a voice,</L>
<L>That solemn-sounding bids the world prepare.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="231"/>
Then issues forth the storm, with mad controul,</L>
<L>And the thin fabrick of the pillar'd air</L>
<L>O'erturns at once. Prone, on the passive main,</L>
<L>Descends th' ethereal force, and with strong gust</L>
<L N="136">Turns from the bottom the discolour'd deep.</L>
<L>Thro' the loud night, that bids the waves arise,</L>
<L>Lash'd into foam, the fierce, conflicting brine</L>
<L>Seems, as it sparkles, all around to burn.</L>
<L>Mean-time whole oceans, heaving to the clouds,</L>
<L N="141">And in broad billows rolling gather'd seas,</L>
<L>Surge over surge, burst in a general roar,</L>
<L>And anchor'd navies from their stations drive,</L>
<L>Wild as the winds athwart the howling waste</L>
<L N="145">Of mighty waters. Now the hilly wave</L>
<L>Straining they scale, and now impetuous shoot</L>
<L>Into the secret chambers of the deep,</L>
<L>The full-blown <HI>Baltick</HI> thundering o'er their head.</L>
<L>Emerging thence again, before the breath</L>
<L N="150">Of all-exerted heaven they wing their course,</L>
<L>And dart on distant coasts; if some sharp rock,</L>
<L>Or sand insidious break not their career,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="232"/>
And in loose fragments fling them floating round.</L>
<L>Nor raging here alone unrein'd at sea,</L>
<L N="155">To land the tempest bears; and o'er the cliff,</L>
<L>Where screams the sea-mew, foaming unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Fierce swallows up the long-resounding shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mountain growls; and all its sturdy sons</L>

<L>Loud rings the frozen earth, and hard reflects</L>
<L>A double noise; while, at his evening watch,</L>
<L>The village-dog deters the nightly thief;</L>
<L>The heifer lows; the distant water-fall</L>

<L>From pole to pole the rigid influence falls,</L>

<L N="611">The various labour of the silent night:</L>

Whose idle torrents only seem to roar,</L>

<L N="616">The liquid kingdom all to solid turn'd;</L>
<L>Wide-spouted o'er the brow, the frozen brook,</L>

<L>The forest bent beneath the plumy wave;</L>
<L N="620">And by the frost refin'd the whiter snow,</L>
<L>Incrusted hard, and sounding to the tread</L>
<L>Of early shepherd, as he pensive seeks</L>
<L>His pining flock, or from the mountain-top,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>On blithesome frolicks bent, the youthful swains,</L>
<L N="626">While every work of man is laid at rest,</L>
<L>Fond o'er the river rush, and shuddering view</L>
<L>The doubtful deeps below. Or where the lake</L>
<L>And long canal the cerule plain extend,</L>

In circling poise; or else disorder'd falls,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pure, quick, and sportful, is the wholesome day;</L>
<L>But soon elaps'd. The horizontal sun,</L>
<L>Broad o'er the south, hangs at his utmost noon;</L>
<L N="640">And, ineffectual, strikes the gelid cliff.</L>
<L>The mountain still his azure gloss maintains,</L>
<L>Nor feels the feeble touch. Perhaps the vale</L>
<L>Relents a while to the reflected ray;</L>
<L>Or from the forest falls the cluster'd snow,</L>
<L N="645">Myriads of gem, that, by the breeze diffus'd,</L>
<L>Gay-twinkle thro' the gleam. Heard thick around,</L>
<L>Thunders the sport of those, who, with the gun,</L>

<L>Worse than the season, desolate the fields;</L>

<L>But what is this? these infant tempests what?</L>
<L>The mockery of <HI>Winter:</HI> should our eye</L>
<L>Astonish'd shoot into the frozen zone;</L>
<L>Where more than half the joyless year is night;</L>
<L N="656">And, failing gradual, life at last goes out.</L>
<L>There undissolving, from the first of time,</L>
<L>Snows swell on snows amazing to the sky;</L>
<L>And icy mountains there, on mountains pil'd,</L>
<L N="660">Seem to the shivering sailor from afar,</L>
<L>Shapeless, and white, an atmosphere of clouds.</L>
<L>Projected huge, and horrid, o'er the main,</L>
<L>Alps frown on Alps; or rushing hideous down,</L>
<L>As if old Chaos was again return'd,</L>
<L>Shake the firm pole, and make an ocean boil.</L>
<L>Whence heap'd abrupt along the howling shore,</L>
<L N="667">And into various shapes (as fancy leans)</L>
<L>Work'd by the wave, the crystal pillars heave,</L>

The restless deep itself cannot resist</L>
<L>The binding fury; but in all its rage</L>

<L>In these fell regions, in <HI>Arzina</HI> caught,</L>

Immediate seal'd, he with his hapless crew,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Muttering, the winds at eve, with hoarser voice</L>
<L>Blow blustering from the south. The frost subdu'd,</L>
<L N="710"><PB N="37" REF="258"/>
Gradual, resolves into a trickling thaw.</L>
<L>Spotted the mountains shine; loose sleet descends,</L>
<L>And floods the country round. The rivers swell,</L>
<L>Impatient for the day. Broke from the hills,</L>
<L>O'er rocks and woods, in broad brown cataracts,</L>
<L N="715">A thousand snow-fed torrents shoot at once;</L>
<L>And, where they rush, the wide-resounding plain</L>

<L>Beneath the shackles of the mighty north;</L>
<L>But, rousing all their waves, resistless heave—</L>
<L>And hark! the lengthening roar continuous runs</L>
<L N="721">Athwart the rifted main: at once it bursts,</L>

<L>Ill fares the bark, the wretch's last resort,</L>
<L>That, lost amid the floating fragments, moors</L>
<L N="725">Beneath the shelter of an icy isle,</L>
<L>While night o'erwhelms the sea, and horror looks</L>

<L>Th' assembled mischiefs that besiege them round:</L>
<L>Heart-gnawing hunger, fainting weariness,</L>
<L N="730"><PB N="40" REF="259"/>
The roar of winds and waves, the crush of ice,</L>
<L>Now ceasing, now renew'd with louder rage,</L>
<L>And in dire echoes bellowing round the main.</L>
<L>More to embroil the deep, Leviathan,</L>
<L>And his unwieldy train, in horrid sport,</L>
<L>Tempest the loosen'd brine; while thro' the gloom;</L>
<L N="736">Far, from the bleak inhospitable shore,</L>
<L>Loading the winds, is heard the hungry howl</L>
<L>Of famish'd monsters, there awaiting wrecks.</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Providence,</HI> that ever-waking eye,</L>

<L>Thro' all this dreary labyrinth of fate.</L>
</LG>

<L>'Tis done!—dread <HI>Winter</HI> has subdu'd the year,</L>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S on the sea-beat shore <HI>Britannia</HI> sat,</L>
<L>Of her degenerate sons the faded fame,</L>
<L>Deep in her anxious heart, revolving sad:</L>
<L>Bare was her throbbing bosom to the gale,</L>
<L>That hoarse, and hollow, from the bleak surge blew;</L>
<L N="6">Loose flow'd her tresses; rent her azure robe.</L>
<L>Hung o'er the deep from her majestic brow</L>
<L>She tore the laurel, and she tore the bay.</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="283"/>
Nor ceas'd the copious grief to bathe her cheek;</L>
<L N="10">Nor ceas'd her sobs to murmur to the Main.</L>
<L>Peace discontented nigh, departing, stretch'd</L>
<L>Her dove-like wings. And War, tho' greatly rous'd,</L>
<L>Yet mourn'd his fetter'd hands. While thus the Queen</L>
<L>Of nations spoke; and what she said the Muse</L>
<L N="15">Recorded, faithful, in unbidden verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Even not yon sail, that, from the sky-mixt wave,</L>
<L>Dawns on the sight, and wafts the <HI>Royal Youth,</HI></L>
<L>A freight of future glory to my shore;</L>
<L>Even not the flattering view of golden days,</L>
<L N="20">And rising periods yet of bright renown,</L>
<L>Beneath the <HI>Parents,</HI> and their endless line</L>
<L>Thro' late revolving time, can sooth my rage;</L>
<L>While, unchastis'd, the insulting <HI>Spaniard</HI> dares</L>
<L>Infest the trading flood, full of vain War</L>
<L N="25">Despise my Navies, and my Merchants seize;</L>
<L>As, trusting to false peace, they fearless roam</L>
<L>The world of waters wild, made, by the toil,</L>
<L>And liberal blood of glorious ages, mine:</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="284"/>
Nor bursts my sleeping thunder on their head.</L>
<L>Whence this unwonted patience? this weak doubt?</L>
<L N="31">This tame beseeching of rejected peace?</L>
<L>This meek forbearance? this unnative fear,</L>
<L>To generous <HI>Britons</HI> never known before?</L>
<L>And fail'd my Fleets for this; on <HI>Indian</HI> tides</L>
<L N="35">To float, unactive, with the veering winds?</L>
<L>The mockery of war! while hot disease,</L>
<L>And sloth distemper'd, swept off burning crowds,</L>
<L>For action ardent; and amid the deep,</L>
<L>Inglorious, sunk them in a watry grave.</L>
<L N="40">There now they lie beneath the rowling flood,</L>
<L>Far from their friends, and country unaveng'd;</L>
<L>And back the weeping war-ship comes again,</L>
<L>Dispirited, and thin; her sons asham'd</L>
<L>Thus idly to review their native shore;</L>
<L N="45">With not one glory sparkling in their eye,</L>
<L>One triumph on their tongue. A passenger,</L>
<L>The violated Merchant comes along;</L>
<L>That far-sought wealth, for which the noxious gale</L>
<L>He drew, and sweat beneath Equator suns,</L>
<L N="50"><PB N="67" REF="285"/>
By lawless force detain'd; a force that soon</L>
<L>Would melt away, and every spoil resign,</L>
<L>Were once the <HI>British</HI> lyon heard to roar.</L>
<L>Whence is it that the proud <HI>Iberian</HI> thus,</L>
<L>In their own well-asserted element,</L>
<L N="55">Dares rouze to wrath the Masters of the Main?</L>
<L>Who told him, that the big incumbent war</L>
<L>Would not, ere this, have roll'd his trembling ports</L>
<L>In smoaky ruin? and his guilty stores,</L>
<L>Won by the ravage of a butcher'd world,</L>

<L>Or led the glittering prize into the <HI>Thames?</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>There was a time (Oh let my languid sons</L>

<L>When all the pride of <HI>Spain,</HI> in one dread fleet,</L>
<L>Swell'd o'er the lab'ring surge; like a whole heaven</L>
<L>Of clouds, wide-roll'd before the boundless breeze.</L>
<L N="67">Gaily the splendid Armament along</L>
<L>Exultant plough'd, reflecting a red gleam,</L>

Tall, gorgeous, and elate; drunk with the dream</L>
<L N="71">Of easy conquest; while their bloated war,</L>

<L>Of ages held in its capacious womb.</L>
<L>But soon, regardless of the cumbrous pomp,</L>
<L N="75">My dauntless <HI>Britons</HI> came, a gloomy few,</L>
<L>With tempest black, the goodly scene deform'd,</L>
<L>And laid their glory waste. The bolts of fate</L>
<L>Resistless thunder'd thro' their yielding sides;</L>
<L>Fierce o'er their beauty blaz'd the lurid flame;</L>
<L N="80">And seiz'd in horrid grasp, or shatter'd wide,</L>
<L>Amid the mighty waters, deep they sunk.</L>
<L>Then too from every promontory chill,</L>
<L>Rank fen, and cavern where the wild wave works,</L>
<L>I swept confederate winds, and swell'd a storm.</L>
<L>Round the glad isle, snatch'd by the vengeful blast,</L>
<L>The scatter'd remnants drove; on the blind shelve,</L>
<L>And pointed rock, that marks the indented shore,</L>
<L>Relentless dash'd, where loud the Northern Main</L>
<L>Howls thro' the fractur'd <HI>Caledonian</HI> isles.</L>

<L>Steril, and void; than of her trade depriv'd,</L>
<L><HI>Britons,</HI> your boasted isle: her Princes sunk;</L>
<L N="240">Her high-built honour moulder'd to the dust;</L>
<L>Unnerv'd her force; her spirit vanish'd quite;</L>
<L>With rapid wing her riches fled away;</L>
<L>Her unfrequented ports alone the sign</L>
<L>Of what she was; her Merchants scatter'd wide;</L>
<L N="245">Her hollow shops shut up; and in her streets,</L>
<L>Her fields, woods, markets, villages, and roads,</L>
<L>The cheerful voice of labour heard no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh let not then waste Luxury impair</L>
<L>That manly soul of toil, which strings your nerves,</L>
<L N="250">And your own proper happiness creates!</L>
<L>Oh let not the soft, penetrating plague</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="295"/>
Creep on the free-born mind! and working there,</L>
<L>With the sharp tooth of many a new-form'd want,</L>
<L>Endless, and idle all, eat out the heart</L>
<L N="255">Of <HI>Liberty</HI>; the high conception blast;</L>
<L>The noble sentiment, the impatient scorn</L>
<L>Of base subjection, and the swelling wish</L>
<L>For general good, erazing from the mind:</L>
<L>While nought save narrow Selfishness succeeds,</L>
<L N="260">And low design, the sneaking passions all</L>
<L>Let loose, and reigning in the rankled breast.</L>
<L>Induc'd at last, by scarce-perceiv'd degrees,</L>
<L>Sapping the very frame of government,</L>
<L>And life, a total dissolution comes;</L>
<L N="265">Sloth, ignorance, dejection, flattery, fear,</L>
<L>Oppression raging o'er the waste he makes;</L>
<L>The human being almost quite extinct;</L>
<L>And the whole state in broad Corruption sinks.</L>
<L>Oh shun that gulph: that gaping ruin shun!</L>
<L N="270">And countless ages roll it far away</L>
<L>From you, ye heaven-belov'd! may <HI>Liberty,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="296"/>
The light of life! the sun of human kind!</L>
<L>Whence Heroes, Bards, and Patriots borrow flame,</L>
<L>Even where the keen depressive North descends,</L>
<L N="275">Still spread, exalt, and actuate your powers!</L>
<L>While slavish Southern climates beam in vain.</L>
<L>And may a publick spirit from the <HI>Throne,</HI></L>
<L>Where every Virtue sits, go copious forth</L>
<L N="279">Live o'er the land! the finer Arts inspire;</L>
<L>Make thoughtful Science raise his pensive head,</L>
<L>Blow the fresh Bay, bid Industry rejoice,</L>
<L>And the rough Sons of lowest Labour smile.</L>
<L>As when, profuse of Spring, the loosen'd West</L>
<L N="284">Lifts up the pining year, and balmy breathes</L>
<L>Youth, life, and love, and beauty o'er the world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But haste we from these melancholly shores,</L>
<L>Nor to deaf winds, and waves, our fruitless plaint</L>
<L>Pour weak; the country claims our active aid;</L>
<L>That let us roam; and where we find a spark</L>
<L N="290">Of publick virtue, blow it into flame.</L>
<L>And now my sons, the sons of freedom! meet</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="297"/>
In awful senate; thither let us fly;</L>
<L>Burn in the Patriot's thought, flow from his tongue</L>
<L>In fearless truth; myself, transform'd, preside,</L>
<L N="295">And shed the spirit of <HI>Britannia</HI> round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This said; her fleeting form, and airy train,</L>
<L>Sunk in the gale; and nought but ragged rocks</L>
<L>Rush'd on the broken eye; and nought was heard</L>
<L N="299">But the rough cadence of the dashing wave.</L>
