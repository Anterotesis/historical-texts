<HEAD>TO
WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is, I hope, some propriety in my addressing a Com∣position
to you, which would never perhaps have existed, had
I not, amid the heavy pressure of many sorrows, derived
infinite consolation from your Poetry, and some degree of
animation and of confidence from your esteem.</P>
<P>The following performance is far from aspiring to be con∣sidered
as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, "<HI>THE
TASK</HI>;" I am perfectly sensible, that it belongs not to a
feeble and feminine hand to draw the Bow of Ulysses.</P>
<P>The force, clearness, and sublimity of your admirable Poem;
the felicity, almost peculiar to your genius, of giving to the
most familiar objects dignity and effect, I could never hope to
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
reach; yet, having read "The Task" almost incessantly from
its first publication to the present time, I felt that kind of
enchantment described by Milton, when he says,
<Q><L>The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear</L>
<L>So charming left his voice, that he awhile</L>
<L>Thought him still speaking.—</L></Q></P>
<P>And from the force of this impression, I was gradually led to
attempt, in Blank Verse, a delineation of those interesting ob∣jects
which happened to excite my attention, and which even
pressed upon an heart, that has learned, perhaps from its own
sufferings, to feel with acute, though unavailing compassion,
the calamity of others.</P>
<P>A Dedication usually consists of praises and of apologies;
<HI>my</HI> praise can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applause
of your country. She regards you with pride, as one of the
few, who, at the present period, rescue her from the imputa∣tion
of having degenerated in Poetical talents; but in the
form of Apology, I should have much to say, if I again dared
to plead the pressure of evils, aggravated by their long conti∣nuance,
as an excuse for the defects of this attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
Whatever may be the faults of its execution, let me vindi∣cate
myself from those, that may be imputed to the design.—
In speaking of the Emigrant Clergy, I beg to be understood as
feeling the utmost respect for the integrity of their principles;
and it is with pleasure I add my suffrage to that of those,
who have had a similar opportunity of witnessing the conduct
of the Emigrants of all descriptions during their exile in Eng∣land;
which has been such as does honour to <HI>their</HI> nation,
and ought to secure to them in ours the esteem of every liberal
mind.</P>
<P>Your philanthropy, dear Sir, will induce you, I am per∣suaded,
to join with me in hoping, that this painful exile may
finally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred so
unworthy of great and enlightened nations; that it may tend
to humanize both countries, by convincing each, that good
qualities exist in the other; and at length annihilate the pre∣judices
that have so long existed to the injury of both.</P>
<P>Yet it is unfortunately but too true, that with the body of
the English, this national aversion has acquired new force by
the dreadful scenes which have been acted in France during
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
the last summer—even those who are the victims of the
Revolution, have not escaped the odium, which the undistin∣guishing
multitude annex to all the natives of a country where
such horrors have been acted: nor is this the worst effect those
events have had on the minds of the English; by confounding
the original cause with the wretched catastrophes that have
followed its ill management; the attempts of public virtue,
with the outrages that guilt and folly have committed in its
disguise, the very name of Liberty has not only lost the charm
it used to have in British ears, but many, who have written,
or spoken, in its defence, have been stigmatized as promoters
of Anarchy, and enemies to the prosperity of their country.
Perhaps even the Author of "The Task," with all his good∣ness
and tenderness of heart, is in the catalogue of those,
who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cause, which
it was once the glory of Englishmen to avow and defend—
The exquisite Poem, indeed, in which you have honoured
Liberty, by a tribute highly gratifying to her sincerest
friends, was published some years before the demolition of
regal despotisin in France, which, in the fifth book, it seems
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
to foretell—All the truth and energy of the passage to which
I allude, must have been strongly felt, when, in the Parlia∣ment
of England, the greatest Orator of our time quoted the
sublimest of our Poets—when the eloquence of Fox did justice
to the genius of Cowper.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, dear SIR,
With the most perfect esteem,
Your obliged and obedient servant,
CHARLOTTE SMITH.</SIGNED>

<STAGE>SCENE, on the Cliffs to the Eastward of the Town of
Brighthelmstone in Sussex.</STAGE>
<STAGE>TIME, a Morning in November, 1792.</STAGE>
<L>SLOW in the Wintry Morn, the struggling light</L>
<L>Throws a faint gleam upon the troubled waves;</L>
<L>Their foaming tops, as they approach the shore</L>
<L>And the broad surf that never ceasing breaks</L>
<L>On the innumerous pebbles, catch the beams</L>
<L>Of the pale Sun, that with reluctance gives</L>
<L>To this cold northern Isle, its shorten'd day.</L>
<L>Alas! how few the morning wakes to joy!</L>
<L>How many murmur at oblivious night</L>
<L>For leaving them so soon; for bearing thus</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="11"/>
Their fancied bliss (the only bliss they taste!),</L>
<L>On her black wings away!—Changing the dreams</L>
<L>That sooth'd their sorrows, for calamities</L>
<L>(And every day brings its own sad proportion)</L>
<L>For doubts, diseases, abject dread of Death,</L>
<L>And faithless friends, and fame and fortune lost;</L>
<L>Fancied or real wants; and wounded pride,</L>
<L>That views the day star, but to curse his beams.</L>
<L>Yet He, whose Spirit into being call'd</L>
<L>This wond'rous World of Waters; He who bids</L>
<L>The wild wind lift them till they dash the clouds,</L>
<L>And speaks to them in thunder; or whose breath,</L>
<L>Low murmuring o'er the gently heaving tides,</L>
<L>When the fair Moon, in summer night serene,</L>
<L>Irradiates with long trembling lines of light</L>
<L>Their undulating surface; that great Power,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="12"/>
Who, governing the Planets, also knows</L>
<L>If but a Sea-Mew falls, whose nest is hid</L>
<L>In these incumbent cliffs; He surely means</L>
<L>To us, his reasoning Creatures, whom He bids</L>
<L>Acknowledge and revere his awful hand,</L>
<L>Nothing but good: Yet Man, misguided Man,</L>
<L>Mars the fair work that he was bid enjoy,</L>
<L>And makes himself the evil he deplores.</L>
<L>How often, when my weary soul recoils</L>
<L>From proud oppression, and from legal crimes</L>
<L>(For such are in this Land, where the vain boast</L>
<L>Of equal Law is mockery, while the cost</L>
<L>Of seeking for redress is sure to plunge</L>
<L>Th' already injur'd to more certain ruin</L>
<L>And the wretch starves, before his Counsel pleads)</L>
<L>How often do I half abjure Society,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="13"/>
And sigh for some lone Cottage, deep embower'd</L>
<L>In the green woods, that these steep chalky Hills</L>
<L>Guard from the strong South West; where round their base</L>
<L>The Beach wide flourishes, and the light Ash</L>
<L>With slender leaf half hides the thymy turf!—</L>
<L>There do I wish to hide me; well content</L>
<L>If on the short grass, strewn with fairy flowers,</L>
<L>I might repose thus shelter'd; or when Eve</L>
<L>In Orient crimson lingers in the west,</L>
<L>Gain the high mound, and mark these waves remote</L>
<L>(Lucid tho' distant), blushing with the rays</L>
<L>Of the far-flaming Orb, that sinks beneath them;</L>
<L>For I have thought, that I should then behold</L>
<L>The beauteous works of God, unspoil'd by Man</L>
<L>And less affected then, by human woes</L>
<L>I witness'd not; might better learn to bear</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="14"/>
Those that injustice, and duplicity</L>
<L>And faithlessness and folly, fix on me:</L>
<L>For never yet could I derive relief,</L>
<L>When my swol'n heart was bursting with its sorrows,</L>
<L>From the sad thought, that others like myself</L>
<L>Live but to swell affliction's countless tribes!</L>
<L>—Tranquil seclusion I have vainly sought;</L>
<L>Peace, who delights in solitary shade,</L>
<L>No more will spread for me her downy wings,</L>
<L>But, like the fabled Danaids—or the wretch,</L>
<L>Who ceaseless, up the steep acclivity,</L>
<L>Was doom'd to heave the still rebounding rock,</L>
<L>Onward I labour; as the baffled wave,</L>
<L>Which you rough beach repulses, that returns</L>
<L>With the next breath of wind, to fail again.—</L>
<L>Ah! Mourner—cease these wailings: cease and learn,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="15"/>
That not the Cot sequester'd, where the briar</L>
<L>And wood-bine wild, embrace the mossy thatch,</L>
<L>(Scarce seen amid the forest gloom obscure!)</L>
<L>Or more substantial farm, well fenced and warm,</L>
<L>Where the full barn, and cattle fodder'd round</L>
<L>Speak rustic plenty; nor the statelier dome</L>
<L>By dark firs shaded, or the aspiring pine,</L>
<L>Close by the village Church (with care conceal'd</L>
<L>By verdant foliage, lest the poor man's grave</L>
<L>Should mar the smiling prospect of his Lord),</L>
<L>Where offices well rang'd, or dove-cote stock'd,</L>
<L>Declare manorial residence; not these</L>
<L>Or any of the buildings, new and trim</L>
<L>With windows circling towards the restless Sea,</L>
<L>Which ranged in rows, now terminate my walk,</L>
<L>Can shut out for an hour the spectre Care,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="16"/>
That from the dawn of reason, follows still</L>
<L>Unhappy Mortals, 'till the friendly grave</L>
<L>(Our sole secure asylum) "ends the chace<REF TARGET="CT032633.NOTE1.1"><SUP>1</SUP></REF>."</L>
<L>Behold, in witness of this mournful truth,</L>
<L>A group approach me, whose dejected looks,</L>
<L>Sad Heralds of distress! proclaim them Men</L>
<L>Banish'd for ever and for conscience sake</L>
<L>From their distracted Country, whence the name</L>
<L>Of Freedom misapplied, and much abus'd</L>
<L>By lawless Anarchy, has driven them far</L>
<L>To wander; with the prejudice they learn'd</L>
<L>From Bigotry (the Tut'ress of the blind),</L>
<L>Thro' the wide World unshelter'd; their sole hope,</L>
<L>That German spoilers, thro' that pleasant land</L>
<L>May carry wide the desolating scourge</L>
<L>Of War and Vengeance; yet unhappy Men,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="17"/>
Whate'er your errors, I lament your fate:</L>
<L>And, as disconsolate and sad ye hang</L>
<L>Upon the barrier of the rock, and seem</L>
<L>To murmur your despondence, waiting long</L>
<L>Some fortunate reverse that never comes;</L>
<L>Methinks in each expressive face, I see</L>
<L>Discriminated anguish; there droops one,</L>
<L>Who in a moping cloister long consum'd</L>
<L>This life inactive, to obtain a better,</L>
<L>And thought that meagre abstinence, to wake</L>
<L>From his hard pallet with the midnight bell,</L>
<L>To live on eleemosynary bread,</L>
<L>And to renounce God's works, would please that God.</L>
<L>And now the poor pale wretch receives, amaz'd,</L>
<L>The pity, strangers give to his distress,</L>
<L>Because these strangers are, by his dark creed,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
Condemn'd as Heretics—and with sick heart</L>
<L>Regrets<REF TARGET="CT032633.NOTE1.2"><SUP>2</SUP></REF> his pious prison, and his beads.—</L>
<L>Another, of more haughty port, declines</L>
<L>The aid he needs not; while in mute despair</L>
<L>His high indignant thoughts go back to France,</L>
<L>Dwelling on all he lost—the Gothic dome,</L>
<L>That vied with splendid palaces<REF TARGET="CT032633.NOTE1.3"><SUP>3</SUP></REF>; the beds</L>
<L>Of silk and down, the silver chalices,</L>
<L>Vestments with gold enwrought for blazing altars;</L>
<L>Where, amid clouds of incense, he held forth</L>
<L>To kneeling crowds the imaginary bones</L>
<L>Of Saints suppos'd, in pearl and gold enchas'd,</L>
<L>And still with more than living Monarchs' pomp</L>
<L>Surrounded; was believ'd by mumbling bigots</L>
<L>To hold the keys of Heaven, and to admit</L>
<L>Whom he thought good to share it—Now alas!</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>
He, to whose daring soul and high ambition</L>
<L>The World seem'd circumscrib'd; who, wont to dream</L>
<L>Of Fleuri, Richelieu, Alberoni, men</L>
<L>Who trod on Empire, and whose politics</L>
<L>Were not beyond the grasp of his vast mind,</L>
<L>Is, in a Land once hostile, still prophan'd</L>
<L>By disbelief, and rites un-orthodox,</L>
<L>The object of compassion—At his side,</L>
<L>Lighter of heart than these, but heavier far</L>
<L>Than he was wont, another victim comes,</L>
<L>An Abbé—who with less contracted brow</L>
<L>Still smiles and flatters, and still talks of Hope;</L>
<L>Which, sanguine as he is, he does not feel,</L>
<L>And so he cheats the sad and weighty pressure</L>
<L>Of evils present;—Still, as Men misled</L>
<L>By early prejudice (so hard to break),</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
I mourn your sorrows; for I too have known</L>
<L>Involuntary exile; and while yet</L>
<L>England had charms for me, have felt how sad</L>
<L>It is to look across the dim cold sea,</L>
<L>That melancholy rolls its refluent tides</L>
<L>Between us and the dear regretted land</L>
<L>We call our own—as now ye pensive wait</L>
<L>On this bleak morning, gazing on the waves</L>
<L>That seem to leave your shore; from whence the wind</L>
<L>Is loaded to your ears, with the deep groans</L>
<L>Of martyr'd Saints and suffering Royalty,</L>
<L>While to your eyes the avenging power of Heaven</L>
<L>Appears in aweful anger to prepare</L>
<L>The storm of vengeance, fraught with plagues and death.</L>
<L>Even he of milder heart, who was indeed</L>
<L>The simple shepherd in a rustic scene,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="21"/>
And, 'mid the vine-clad hills of Languedoc,</L>
<L>Taught to the bare-foot peasant, whose hard hands</L>
<L>Produc'd<REF TARGET="CT032633.NOTE1.4"><SUP>4</SUP></REF> the nectar he could seldom taste,</L>
<L>Submission to the Lord for whom he toil'd;</L>
<L>He, or his brethren, who to Neustria's sons</L>
<L>Enforc'd religious patience, when, at times,</L>
<L>On their indignant hearts Power's iron hand</L>
<L>Too strongly struck; eliciting some sparks</L>
<L>Of the bold spirit of their native North;</L>
<L>Even these Parochial Priests, these humbled men,</L>
<L>Whose lowly undistinguish'd cottages</L>
<L>Witness'd a life of purest piety,</L>
<L>While the meek tenants were, perhaps, unknown</L>
<L>Each to the haughty Lord of his domain,</L>
<L>Who mark'd them not; the Noble scorning still</L>
<L>The poor and pious Priest, as with slow pace</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="22"/>
He glided thro' the dim arch'd avenue</L>
<L>Which to the Castle led; hoping to cheer</L>
<L>The last sad hour of some laborious life</L>
<L>That hasten'd to its close—even such a Man</L>
<L>Becomes an exile; staying not to try</L>
<L>By temperate zeal to check his madd'ning flock,</L>
<L>Who, at the novel sound of Liberty</L>
<L>(Ah! most intoxicating sound to slaves!),</L>
<L>Start into licence—Lo! dejected now,</L>
<L>The wandering Pastor mourns, with bleeding heart,</L>
<L>His erring people, weeps and prays for them,</L>
<L>And trembles for the account that he must give</L>
<L>To Heaven for souls entrusted to his care.—</L>
<L>Where the cliff, hollow'd by the wintry storm,</L>
<L>Affords a seat with matted sea-weed strewn,</L>
<L>A softer form reclines; around her run,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="23"/>
On the rough shingles, or the chalky bourn,</L>
<L>Her gay unconscious children, soon amus'd;</L>
<L>Who pick the fretted stone, or glossy shell,</L>
<L>Or crimson plant marine: or they contrive</L>
<L>The fairy vessel, with its ribband sail</L>
<L>And gilded paper pennant: in the pool,</L>
<L>Left by the salt wave on the yielding sands,</L>
<L>They launch the mimic navy—Happy age!</L>
<L>Unmindful of the miseries of Man!—</L>
<L>Alas! too long a victim to distress,</L>
<L>Their Mother, lost in melancholy thought,</L>
<L>Lull'd for a moment by the murmurs low</L>
<L>Of sullen billows, wearied by the task</L>
<L>Of having here, with swol'n and aching eyes</L>
<L>Fix'd on the grey horizon, since the dawn</L>
<L>Solicitously watch'd the weekly sail</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
From her dear native land, now yields awhile</L>
<L>To kind forgetfulness, while Fancy brings,</L>
<L>In waking dreams, that native land again!</L>
<L>Versailles appears—its painted galleries,</L>
<L>And rooms of regal splendour; rich with gold,</L>
<L>Where, by long mirrors multiply'd, the crowd</L>
<L>Paid willing homage—and, united there,</L>
<L>Beauty gave charms to empire—Ah! too soon</L>
<L>From the gay visionary pageant rous'd,</L>
<L>See the sad mourner start!—and, drooping, look</L>
<L>With tearful eyes and heaving bosom round</L>
<L>On drear reality—where dark'ning waves,</L>
<L>Urg'd by the rising wind, unheeded foam</L>
<L>Near her cold rugged seat:—To call her thence</L>
<L>A fellow-sufferer comes: dejection deep</L>
<L>Checks, but conceals not quite, the martial air,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
And that high consciousness of noble blood,</L>
<L>Which he has learn'd from infancy to think</L>
<L>Exalts him o'er the race of common men:</L>
<L>Nurs'd in the velvet lap of luxury,</L>
<L>And fed by adulation—could <HI>he</HI> learn,</L>
<L>That worth alone is true Nobility?</L>
<L>And that <HI>the peasant</HI> who, "amid<REF TARGET="CT032633.NOTE1.5"><SUP>5</SUP></REF> the sons</L>
<L>"Of Reason, Valour, Liberty, and Virtue,</L>
<L>"Displays distinguish'd merit, is a Noble</L>
<L>"Of Nature's own creation!"—If even here,</L>
<L>If in this land of highly vaunted Freedom,</L>
<L>Even Britons controvert the unwelcome truth,</L>
<L>Can it be relish'd by the sons of France?</L>
<L>Men, who derive their boasted ancestry</L>
<L>From the fierce leaders of religious wars,</L>
<L>The first in Chivalry's emblazon'd page;</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
Who reckon Gueslin, Bayard, or De Foix,</L>
<L>Among their brave Progenitors? <HI>Their</HI> eyes,</L>
<L>Accustom'd to regard the splendid trophies</L>
<L>Of Heraldry (that with fantastic hand</L>
<L>Mingles, like images in feverish dreams,</L>

<L>For Nature's genuine beauty; in the lapse</L>

Nor listens with delight to sighing winds,</L>

<L>If by that power impos'd, slavery no more:</L>
<L>For luxury wreathes with silk the iron bonds,</L>
<L>And hides the ugly rivets with her flowers,</L>
<L>Till the degenerate triflers, while they love</L>
<L>The glitter of the chains, forget their weight.</L>
<L>But more the Men<REF TARGET="CT032633.NOTE1.7"><SUP>7</SUP></REF>, whose ill acquir'd wealth</L>

Was wrung from plunder'd myriads, by the means</L>
<L>Too often legaliz'd by power abus'd,</L>

<L>When their ephemeral greatness, marr'd at once</L>
<L>(As a vain toy that Fortune's childish hand</L>
<L>Equally joy'd to fashion or to crush),</L>
<L>Leaves them expos'd to universal scorn</L>
<L>For having nothing else; not even the claim</L>
<L>To honour, which respect for Heroes past</L>
<L>Allows to ancient titles; Men, like these,</L>
<L>Sink even beneath the level, whence base arts</L>
<L>Alone had rais'd them;—unlamented sink,</L>
<L>And know that they deserve the woes they feel.</L>
<L>Poor wand'ring wretches! whosoe'er ye are,</L>

<L>O'er these bleak russet downs; where, dimly seen,</L>

The solitary Shepherd shiv'ring tends</L>
<L>His dun discolour'd flock (Shepherd, unlike</L>

<L>A while, suspend your murmurs!—here behold</L>
<L>The strange vicissitudes of fate—while thus</L>
<L>The exil'd Nobles, from their country driven,</L>
<L>Whose richest luxuries were their's, must feel</L>
<L>More poignant anguish, than the lowest poor,</L>
<L>Who, born to indigence, have learn'd to brave</L>
<L>Rigid Adversity's depressing breath!—</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="30"/>
Ah! rather Fortune's worthless favourites!</L>
<L>Who feed on England's vitals—Pensioners</L>

reflect invidiously on the Emigrant Clergy, 

whose steadi∣ness of principle excites

<STAGE>SCENE, on an Eminence on one of those Downs, which
afford to the South a View of the Sea; to the North of
the Weald of Sussex.</STAGE>
<STAGE>TIME, an Afternoon in April, 1793.</STAGE>
<L>LONG wintry months are past; the Moon that now</L>
<L>Lights her pale crescent even at noon, has made</L>
<L>Four times her revolution; since with step,</L>
<L>Mournful and slow, along the wave-worn cliff,</L>
<L>Pensive I took my solitary way,</L>
<L>Lost in despondence, while contemplating</L>
<L>Not my own wayward destiny alone,</L>
<L>(Hard as it is, and difficult to bear!)</L>
<L>But in beholding the unhappy lot</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="39"/>
Of the lorn Exiles; who, amid the storms</L>
<L>Of wild disastrous Anarchy, are thrown,</L>
<L>Like shipwreck'd sufferers, on England's coast,</L>
<L>To see, perhaps, no more their native land,</L>
<L>Where Desolation riots: They, like me,</L>
<L>From fairer hopes and happier prospects driven,</L>
<L>Shrink from the future, and regret the past.</L>
<L>But on this Upland scene, while April comes,</L>
<L>With fragrant airs, to fan my throbbing breast,</L>
<L>Fain would I snatch an interval from Care,</L>
<L>That weighs my wearied spirit down to earth;</L>
<L>Courting, once more, the influence of Hope</L>
<L>(For "Hope" still waits upon the flowery prime)</L>
<L>As here I mark Spring's humid hand unfold</L>
<L>The early leaves that fear capricious winds,</L>
<L>While, even on shelter'd banks, the timid flowers</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="40"/>
Give, half reluctantly, their warmer hues</L>
<L>To mingle with the primroses' pale stars.</L>
<L>No shade the leafless copses yet afford,</L>
<L>Nor hide the mossy labours of the Thrush,</L>
<L>That, startled, darts across the narrow path;</L>
<L>But quickly re-assur'd, resumes his task,</L>
<L>Or adds his louder notes to those that rise</L>
<L>From yonder tufted brake; where the white buds</L>
<L>Of the first thorn are mingled with the leaves</L>
<L>Of that which blossoms on the brow of May.</L>
<L>Ah! 'twill not be:—So many years have pass'd,</L>
<L>Since, on my native hills, I learn'd to gaze</L>
<L>On these delightful landscapes; and those years</L>
<L>Have taught me so much sorrow, that my soul</L>
<L>Feels not the joy reviving Nature brings;</L>
<L>But, in dark retrospect, dejected dwells</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="41"/>
On human follies, and on human woes.—</L>
<L>What is the promise of the infant year,</L>
<L>The lively verdure, or the bursting blooms,</L>
<L>To those, who shrink from horrors such as War</L>
<L>Spreads o'er the affrighted world? With swimming eye,</L>
<L>Back on the past they throw their mournful looks,</L>
<L>And see the Temple, which they fondly hop'd</L>
<L>Reason would raise to Liberty, destroy'd</L>
<L>By ruffian hands; while, on the ruin'd mass,</L>
<L>Flush'd with hot blood, the Fiend of Discord sits</L>
<L>In savage triumph; mocking every plea</L>
<L>Of policy and justice, as she shews</L>
<L>The headless corse of one, whose only crime</L>

<L>From spectacle so dire, her swol'n eyes;</L>
<L>And Liberty, with calm, unruffled brow</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="42"/>
Magnanimous, as conscious of her strength</L>
<L>In Reason's panoply, scorns to distain</L>
<L>Her righteous cause with carnage, and resigns</L>

<L>What is the promise of the infant year</L>
<L>To those, who (while the poor but peaceful hind</L>
<L>Pens, unmolested, the encreasing flock</L>

<L>Drowns the soft warbling of the woodland choir;</L>
<L>And violets, lurking in their turfy beds</L>

<L>There fall, at once, the spoiler and the spoil'd;</L>
<L>While War, wide-ravaging, annihilates</L>

The hope of cultivation; gives to Fiends,</L>
<L>The meagre, ghastly Fiends of Want and Woe,</L>

<L>Then, in an humble sphere, perhaps content,</L>
<L>Thou hadst been free and joyous on the heights</L>
<L>Of Pyrennean mountains, shagg'd with woods</L>
<L>Of chesnut, pine, and oak: as on these hills</L>
<L>Is yonder little thoughtless shepherd lad,</L>
<L>Who, on the slope abrupt of downy turf</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="47"/>
Reclin'd in playful indolence, sends off</L>
<L>The chalky ball, quick bounding far below;</L>
<L>While, half forgetful of his simple task,</L>

<L>High (as it seem'd) above the envious reach</L>
<L>Of destiny! Whate'er thy errors were,</L>

From sad experience, more than I, to feel</L>

<L>Of misery is thine, as once of joy;</L>
<L>And, as we view the strange vicissitude,</L>
<L>We ask anew, where happiness is found?—</L>
<L>Alas! in rural life, where youthful dreams</L>
<L>See the Arcadia that Romance describes,</L>
<L>Not even Content resides!—In yon low hut</L>
<L>Of clay and thatch, where rises the grey smoke</L>
<L>Of smold'ring turf, cut from the adjoining moor,</L>
<L>The labourer, its inhabitant, who toils</L>
<L>From the first dawn of twilight, till the Sun</L>

<L>Finds that with poverty it cannot dwell;</L>

For bread, and scanty bread, is all he earns</L>

<L>Attempt, with feeble effort, to resume</L>
<L>Some heavy task, above his wasted strength,</L>

<L>To the deserted mansion, where no more</L>

<L><PB N="52" REF="51"/>
Who made even luxury, Virtue; while he gave</L>
<L>The scatter'd crumbs to honest Poverty.—</L>
<L>But, tho' the landscape be too oft deform'd</L>
<L>By figures such as these, yet Peace is here,</L>
<L>And o'er our vallies, cloath'd with springing corn,</L>
<L>No hostile hoof shall trample, nor fierce flames</L>
<L>Wither the wood's young verdure, ere it form</L>
<L>Gradual the laughing May's luxuriant shade;</L>
<L>For, by the rude sea guarded, we are safe,</L>

<L>Shuddering, I view the pictures they have drawn</L>
<L>Of desolated countries, where the ground,</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="52"/>
Stripp'd of its unripe produce, was thick strewn</L>
<L>With various Death—the war-horse falling there</L>
<L>By famine, and his rider by the sword.</L>
<L>The moping clouds sail'd heavy charg'd with rain,</L>

<L>Where, thro' the sullen evening's lurid gloom,</L>
<L>Rising, like columns of volcanic fire,</L>
<L>The flames of burning villages illum'd</L>
<L>The waste of water; and the wind, that howl'd</L>
<L>Along its troubled surface, brought the groans</L>
<L>Of plunder'd peasants, and the frantic shrieks</L>
<L>Of mothers for their children; while the brave,</L>

<L>To these dire echoes, hopeless to prevent</L>

Which ever, as the people of one land</L>

<L>Than the gaunt monsters of the howling waste.</L>
<L>Oft have I heard the melancholy tale,</L>

Unable to endure<REF TARGET="CT032633.NOTE2.7"><SUP>7</SUP></REF>, often implor'd,</L>

All she could rescue of the innocent groupe</L>

<L>Is mark'd by wreaths of flame!—Then, overwhelm'd</L>
<L>Beneath accumulated horror, sinks</L>
<L>The desolate mourner; yet, in Death itself,</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="56"/>
True to maternal tenderness, she tries</L>
<L>To save the unconscious infant from the storm</L>
<L>In which she perishes; and to protect</L>
<L>This last dear object of her ruin'd hopes</L>
<L>From prowling monsters, that from other hills,</L>
<L>More inaccessible, and wilder wastes,</L>
<L>Lur'd by the scent of slaughter, follow fierce</L>
<L>Contending hosts, and to polluted fields</L>
<L>Add dire increase of horrors—But alas!</L>
<L>The Mother and the Infant perish both!—</L>
<L>The feudal Chief, whose Gothic battlements</L>
<L>Frown on the plain beneath, returning home</L>
<L>From distant lands, alone and in disguise,</L>
<L>Gains at the fall of night his Castle walls,</L>
<L>But, at the vacant gate, no Porter sits</L>
<L>To wait his Lord's admittance!—In the courts</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="57"/>
All is drear silence!—Guessing but too well</L>
<L>The fatal truth, he shudders as he goes</L>
<L>Thro' the mute hall; where, by the blunted light</L>
<L>That the dim moon thro' painted casements lends,</L>
<L>He sees that devastation has been there:</L>
<L>Then, while each hideous image to his mind</L>
<L>Rises terrific, o'er a bleeding corse</L>
<L>Stumbling he falls; another interrupts</L>
<L>His staggering feet—all, all who us'd to rush</L>
<L>With joy to meet him—all his family</L>
<L>Lie murder'd in his way!—And the day dawns</L>
<L>On a wild raving Maniac, whom a fate</L>
<L>So sudden and calamitous has robb'd</L>
<L>Of reason; and who round his vacant walls</L>
<L>Screams unregarded, and reproaches Heaven!—</L>
<L>Such are thy dreadful trophies, savage War!</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="58"/>
And evils such as these, or yet more dire,</L>
<L>Which the pain'd mind recoils from, all are thine—</L>
<L>The purple Pestilence, that to the grave</L>
<L>Sends whom the sword has spar'd, is thine; and thine</L>
<L>The Widow's anguish and the Orphan's tears!—</L>
<L>Woes such as these does Man inflict on Man;</L>
<L>And by the closet murderers, whom we style</L>
<L>Wise Politicians, are the schemes prepar'd,</L>
<L>Which, to keep Europe's wavering balance even,</L>
<L>Depopulate her kingdoms, and consign</L>
<L>To tears and anguish half a bleeding world!—</L>
<L>Oh! could the time return, when thoughts like these</L>
<L>Spoil'd not that gay delight, which vernal Suns,</L>
<L>Illuminating hills, and woods, and fields,</L>
<L>Gave to my infant spirits—Memory come!</L>
<L>And from distracting cares, that now deprive</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="59"/>
Such scenes of all their beauty, kindly bear</L>
<L>My fancy to those hours of simple joy,</L>
<L>When, on the banks of Arun, which I see</L>
<L>Make its irriguous course thro' yonder meads,</L>
<L>I play'd; unconscious then of future ill!</L>
<L>There (where, from hollows fring'd with yellow broom,</L>
<L>The birch with silver rind, and fairy leaf,</L>
<L>Aslant the low stream trembles) I have stood,</L>
<L>And meditated how to venture best</L>
<L>Into the shallow current, to procure</L>
<L>The willow herb of glowing purple spikes,</L>
<L>Or flags, whose sword-like leaves conceal'd the tide,</L>
<L>Startling the timid reed-bird from her nest,</L>
<L>As with aquatic flowers I wove the wreath,</L>
<L>Such as, collected by the shepherd girls,</L>
<L>Deck in the villages the turfy shrine,</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="60"/>
And mark the arrival of propitious May.—</L>
<L>How little dream'd I then the time would come,</L>
<L>When the bright Sun of that delicious month</L>
<L>Should, from disturb'd and artificial sleep,</L>
<L>Awaken me to never-ending toil,</L>
<L>To terror and to tears!—Attempting still,</L>
<L>With feeble hands and cold desponding heart,</L>
<L>To save my children from the o'erwhelming wrongs,</L>
<L>That have for ten long years been heap'd on me!—</L>
<L>The fearful spectres of chicane and fraud</L>
<L>Have, Proteus like, still chang'd their hideous forms</L>
<L>(As the Law lent its plausible disguise),</L>
<L>Pursuing my faint steps; and I have seen</L>
<L>Friendship's sweet bonds (which were so early form'd,)</L>
<L>And once I fondly thought of amaranth</L>
<L>Inwove with silver seven times tried) give way,</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="61"/>
And fail; as these green fan-like leaves of fern</L>
<L>Will wither at the touch of Autumn's frost.</L>
<L>Yet there <HI>are those,</HI> whose patient pity still</L>
<L>Hears my long murmurs; who, unwearied, try</L>
<L>With lenient hands to bind up every wound</L>
<L>My wearied spirit feels, and bid me go</L>
<L>"Right onward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>"—a calm votary of the Nymph,</L>
<L>Who, from her adamantine rock, points out</L>
<L>To conscious rectitude the rugged path,</L>
<L>That leads at length to Peace!—Ah! yes, my friends</L>
<L>Peace will at last be mine; for in the Grave</L>
<L>Is Peace—and pass a few short years, perchance</L>
<L>A few short months, and all the various pain</L>
<L>I now endure shall be forgotten there,</L>
<L>And no memorial shall remain of me,</L>
<L>Save in your bosoms; while even <HI>your</HI> regret</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="62"/>
Shall lose its poignancy, as ye reflect</L>
<L>What complicated woes that grave conceals!</L>
<L>But, if the little praise, that may await</L>
<L>The Mother's efforts, should provoke the spleen</L>
<L>Of Priest or Levite; and they then arraign</L>
<L>The dust that cannot hear them; be it yours</L>
<L>To vindicate my humble fame; to say,</L>
<L>That, not in selfish sufferings absorb'd,</L>
<L>"I gave to misery all I had, my tears<REF TARGET="CT032633.NOTE2.8"><SUP>8</SUP></REF>."</L>
<L>And if, where regulated sanctity</L>
<L>Pours her long orisons to Heaven, my voice</L>
<L>Was seldom heard, that yet <HI>my prayer</HI> was made</L>
<L>To him who hears even silence; not in domes</L>
<L>Of human architecture, fill'd with crowds,</L>
<L>But on these hills, where boundless, yet distinct,</L>
<L>Even as a map, beneath are spread the fields</L>
<L>His bounty cloaths; divided here by woods,</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="63"/>
And there by commons rude, or winding brooks,</L>
<L>While I might breathe the air perfum'd with flowers,</L>
<L>Or the fresh odours of the mountain turf;</L>
<L>And gaze on clouds above me, as they sail'd</L>
<L>Majestic: or remark the reddening north,</L>
<L>When bickering arrows of electric fire</L>
<L>Flash on the evening sky—I made my prayer</L>
<L>In unison with murmuring waves that now</L>
<L>Swell with dark tempests, now are mild and blue,</L>
<L>As the bright arch above; for all to me</L>
<L>Declare omniscient goodness; nor need I</L>
<L>Declamatory essays to incite</L>
<L>My wonder or my praise, when every leaf</L>
<L>That Spring unfolds, and every simple bud,</L>
<L>More forcibly impresses on my heart</L>
<L>His power and wisdom—Ah! while I adore</L>
<L>That goodness, which design'd to all that lives</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="64"/>
Some taste of happiness, my soul is pain'd</L>
<L>By the variety of woes that Man</L>
<L>For Man creates—his blessings often turn'd</L>
<L>To plagues and curses: Saint-like Piety,</L>
<L>Misled by Superstition, has destroy'd</L>
<L>More than Ambition; and the sacred flame</L>
<L>Of Liberty becomes a raging fire,</L>
<L>When Licence and Confusion bid it blaze.</L>
<L>From thy high throne, above yon radiant stars,</L>
<L>O Power Omnipotent! with mercy view</L>
<L>This suffering globe, and cause thy creatures cease,</L>
<L>With savage fangs, to tear her bleeding breast:</L>
<L>Restrain that rage for power, that bids a Man,</L>
<L>Himself a worm, desire unbounded rule</L>
<L>O'er beings like himself: Teach the hard hearts</L>
<L>Of rulers, that the poorest hind, who dies</L>
<L>For their unrighteous quarrels, in thy sight</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="65"/>
Is equal to the imperious Lord, that leads</L>
<L>His disciplin'd destroyers to the field.—</L>
<L>May lovely Freedom, in her genuine charms,</L>
<L>Aided by stern but equal Justice, drive</L>
<L>From the ensanguin'd earth the hell-born fiends</L>
<L>Of Pride, Oppression, Avarice, and Revenge,</L>
<L>That ruin what thy mercy made so fair!</L>
<L>Then shall these ill-starr'd wanderers, whose sad fate</L>
<L>These desultory lines lament, regain</L>
<L>Their native country; private vengeance then</L>
<L>To public virtue yield; and the fierce feuds,</L>
<L>That long have torn their desolated land,</L>
<L>May (even as storms, that agitate the air,</L>
<L>Drive noxious vapours from the blighted earth)</L>
<L>Serve, all tremendous as they are, to fix</L>
<L>The reign of Reason, Liberty, and Peace!</L>

It may be said of this monarch, that had all the 

French sovereigns resembled him, despotism 

would have lost its horrors; yet he had 

considerable failings, and his greatest virtues

the heavy and incessant rains during the last 

campaign, the armies were often compelled to march 

for many miles through marshes overflowed; 

suffering the extre∣mities of cold and fatigue. 

The peasants frequently misled them; and, after 

having passed these inundations at the hazard 

of their lives, they were sometimes under the 

necessity of crossing them a second and a 

third time; their evening quarters after such a 

day of exertion were often in a wood without 

shelter; and their repast, instead of bread, 

unripe corn, without any other preparation than 

being mashed into a sort of paste.</P>

remarkable, that notwithstanding the 

excessive hardships to which the army of the 

Emi∣grants was exposed, very few in it suffered 

from disease till they began to retreat; then 

it was that despondence consigned to the most 

miserable death many brave men who deserved a 

better fate; and then despair im∣pelled some to 

suicide, while others fell by mutual wounds, 

unable to survive disappointment and 

humiliation.</P>
