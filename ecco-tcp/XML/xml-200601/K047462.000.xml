Unknown Himself, and only introduced by the <HI>Muse,</HI> He yet ventures to approach You, with a modest Chearfulness: For, whoever attempts to excel in any Generous Art, tho' he comes alone, and unre∣garded by the World, may hope for your Notice, and Esteem. Happy! if I can, in any Degree, merit this Good Fortune: as every Ornament, and Grace of Polite Learning is yours, your single Approbation will be my Fame.</P>
<P>I DARE not indulge my Heart, by dwelling on your <HI>Public</HI> Character; on that exalted Honour, and Integrity which distinguish You, in that <HI>August Assembly,</HI> where You preside; that unshaken Loyalty to your <HI>Sovereign,</HI> that disinterested Concern for his <HI>People,</HI> which shine

out, united, in all your Behaviour, and finish the <HI>Patriot.</HI> I am conscious of my Want of Strength, and Skill for so delicate an Undertaking: And yet, as the Shepherd, in his Cottage, may feel and acknowledge the Influence of the Sun with as lively a Gratitude, as the Great Man, in his Palace, <HI>even I</HI> may be allowed to publish <HI>my Sense</HI> of those Blessings, which, from so many powerful Vertues, are derived to the Nation they adorn.</P>
<P>I conclude with saying, that your fine Discernment and Humanity, in your <HI>Private</HI> Capacity, are so con∣spicuous, that, if this Address is not received with some Indulgence, it will be a severe Conviction, that what I have written has not the least Share of Merit.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>EE! WINTER comes, to rule the varied Year,</L>
<L>Sullen, and sad; with all his rising Train,</L>
<L><HI>Vapours,</HI> and <HI>Clouds,</HI> and <HI>Storms:</HI> Be these my Theme,</L>
<L>These, that exalt the Soul to solemn Thought,</L>
<L>And heavenly musing. Welcome kindred Glooms!</L>
<L>Wish'd, wint'ry, Horrors, hail!—With frequent Foot,</L>
<L>Pleas'd, have I, in my cheerful Morn of Life,</L>
<L>When, nurs'd by careless <HI>Solitude,</HI> I liv'd,</L>
<L>And sung of Nature with unceasing Joy,</L>
<L>Pleas'd, have I wander'd thro' your rough Domains;</L>
<L>Trod the pure, virgin, Snows, my self as pure:</L>
<L>Heard the Winds roar, and the big Torrent burst:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
Or seen the deep, fermenting, Tempest brew'd,</L>
<L>In the red, evening, Sky.—Thus pass'd the Time,</L>
<L>Till, thro' the opening Chambers of the South,</L>
<L>Look'd out the joyous <HI>Spring,</HI> look'd out, and smil'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEE too, Inspirer of the toiling Swain!</L>
<L>Fair AUTUMN, yellow rob'd! I'll sing of thee,</L>
<L>Of thy last, temper'd, Days, and sunny Calms;</L>
<L>When all the golden <HI>Hours</HI> are on the Wing,</L>
<L>Attending thy Retreat, and round thy Wain,</L>
<L>Slow-rolling, onward to the Southern Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BEHOLD! the well-pois'd <HI>Hornet,</HI> hovering, hangs,</L>
<L>With quivering Pinions, in the genial Blaze;</L>
<L>Flys off, in airy Circles: then returns,</L>
<L>And hums, and dances to the beating Ray.</L>
<L>Nor shall the Man, that, musing, walks alone,</L>
<L>And, heedless, strays within his radiant Lists,</L>
<L>Go unchastis'd away.—Sometimes, a Fleece</L>
<L>Of Clouds, wide-scattering, with a lucid Veil,</L>
<L>Soft, shadow o'er th' unruffled Face of Heaven;</L>
<L>And, thro' their dewy Sluices, shed the Sun,</L>
<L>With temper'd Influence down. Then is the Time,</L>
<L>For those, whom <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and whom <HI>Nature</HI> charm,</L>
<L>To steal themselves from the degenerate Croud,</L>
<L>And soar above this <HI>little</HI> Scene of Things:</L>
<L>To tread low-thoughted <HI>Vice</HI> beneath their Feet:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
To lay their Passions in a gentle Calm,</L>
<L>And woo lone <HI>Quiet,</HI> in her silent <HI>Walks.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, solitary, and in pensive Guise,</L>
<L>Oft, let me wander o'er the russet Mead,</L>
<L>Or thro' the pining Grove; where scarce is heard</L>
<L>One dying Strain, to chear the <HI>Woodman</HI>'s Toil:</L>
<L>Sad <HI>Philomel,</HI> perchance, pours forth her Plaint,</L>
<L>Far, thro' the withering Copse. Mean while, the Leaves,</L>
<L>That, late, the Forest clad with lively Green,</L>
<L>Nipt by the drizzly Night, and Sallow-hu'd,</L>
<L>Fall, wavering, thro' the Air; or shower amain,</L>
<L>Urg'd by the Breeze, that sobs amid the Boughs.</L>
<L>Then list'ning <HI>Hares</HI> forsake the rusling Woods,</L>
<L>And, starting at the frequent Noise, escape</L>
<L>To the rough Stubble, and the rushy Fen.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Woodcocks,</HI> o'er the fluctuating Main,</L>
<L>That glimmers to the Glimpses of the Moon,</L>
<L>Stretch their long Voyage to the woodland Glade:</L>
<L>Where, wheeling with uncertain Flight, they mock</L>
<L>The nimble <HI>Fowler</HI>'s Aim.—Now <HI>Nature</HI> droops;</L>
<L>Languish the living Herbs, with pale Decay:</L>
<L>And all the <HI>various Family</HI> of Flowers</L>
<L>Their sunny Robes resign. The falling Fruits,</L>
<L>Thro' the still Night, forsake the Parent-Bough,</L>
<L>That, in the first, grey, Glances of the Dawn,</L>
<L>Looks wild, and wonders at the wintry Waste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<L>THE <HI>Year,</HI> yet pleasing, but declining fast,</L>
<L>Soft, o'er the secret Soul, in gentle Gales,</L>
<L>A Philosophic Melancholly breathes,</L>
<L>And bears the swelling Thought aloft to Heaven.</L>
<L>Then forming <HI>Fancy</HI> rouses to conceive,</L>
<L>What never mingled with the Vulgar's Dream:</L>
<L>Then wake the tender <HI>Pang,</HI> the pitying <HI>Tear,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Sigh</HI> for suffering Worth, the <HI>Wish</HI> prefer'd</L>
<L>For Humankind, the <HI>Joy</HI> to see them bless'd,</L>
<L>And all the <HI>Social Off-spring</HI> of the Heart!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH! bear me then to high, embowering, Shades;</L>
<L>To twilight Groves, and visionary Vales;</L>
<L>To weeping Grottos, and to hoary Caves;</L>
<L>Where Angel-Forms are seen, and Voices heard,</L>
<L>Sigh'd in low Whispers, that abstract the Soul,</L>
<L>From outward Sense, far into Worlds remote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, when the Western Sun withdraws the Day,</L>
<L>And humid <HI>Evening,</HI> gliding o'er the Sky,</L>
<L>In her chill Progress, checks the straggling Beams,</L>
<L>And robs them of their gather'd, vapoury, Prey,</L>
<L>Where Marshes stagnate, and where Rivers wind,</L>
<L>Cluster the rolling <HI>Fogs,</HI> and swim along</L>
<L>The dusky-mantled Lawn: then slow descend,</L>
<L>Once more to mingle with their <HI>Watry Friends.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="9"/>
The vivid Stars shine out, in radiant Files;</L>
<L>And boundless <HI>Ether</HI> glows, till the fair Moon</L>
<L>Shows her broad Visage, in the crimson'd East;</L>
<L>Now, stooping, seems to kiss the passing Cloud:</L>
<L>Now, o'er the pure <HI>Cerulean,</HI> rides sublime.</L>
<L>Wide the pale Deluge floats, with silver Waves,</L>
<L>O'er the sky'd Mountain, to the low-laid Vale;</L>
<L>From the white Rocks, with dim Reflexion, gleams,</L>
<L>And faintly glitters thro' the waving Shades.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ALL Night, abundant Dews, unnoted, fall,</L>
<L>And, at Return of Morning, silver o'er</L>
<L>The Face of Mother-Earth; from every Branch</L>
<L>Depending, tremble the translucent Gems,</L>
<L>And, quivering, seem to fall away, yet cling,</L>
<L>And sparkle in the Sun, whose rising Eye,</L>
<L>With Fogs bedim'd, portends a beauteous Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, giddy Youth, whom headlong Passions fire,</L>
<L>Rouse the wild Game, and stain the guiltless Grove,</L>
<L>With Violence, and Death; yet call it Sport,</L>
<L>To scatter Ruin thro' the Realms of <HI>Love,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Peace,</HI> that thinks no Ill: But These, the <HI>Muse,</HI></L>
<L>Whose Charity, unlimited, extends</L>
<L>As wide as <HI>Nature</HI> works, disdains to sing,</L>
<L>Returning to her nobler Theme in view—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
<L>FOR, see! where <HI>Winter</HI> comes, himself, confest,</L>
<L>Striding the gloomy Blast. First Rains obscure</L>
<L>Drive thro' the mingling Skies, with Tempest foul;</L>
<L>Beat on the Mountain's Brow, and shake the Woods,</L>
<L>That, sounding, wave below. The dreary Plain</L>
<L>Lies overwhelm'd, and lost. The bellying Clouds</L>
<L>Combine, and deepening into Night, shut up</L>
<L>The Day's fair Face. The Wanderers of Heaven,</L>
<L>Each to his Home, retire; save those that love</L>
<L>To take their Pastime in the troubled Air,</L>
<L>And, skimming, flutter round the dimply Flood.</L>
<L>The Cattle, from th' untasted Fields, return,</L>
<L>And ask, with Meaning low, their wonted Stalls;</L>
<L>Or ruminate in the contiguous Shade:</L>
<L>Thither, the houshold, feathery, People croud,</L>
<L>The crested Cock, with all his female Train,</L>
<L>Pensive, and wet. Mean while, the Cottage-Swain</L>
<L>Hangs o'er th' enlivening Blaze, and, taleful, there,</L>
<L>Recounts his simple Frolic: Much he talks,</L>
<L>And much he laughs, nor recks the Storm that blows</L>
<L>Without, and rattles on his humble Roof.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT last, the muddy Deluge pours along,</L>
<L>Resistless, roaring; dreadful down it comes</L>
<L>From the chapt Mountain, and the mossy Wild,</L>
<L>Tumbling thro' Rocks abrupt, and sounding far</L>
<L>Then o'er the sanded Valley, floating, spreads,</L>
<L>Calm, sluggish, silent; till again constrain'd,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="11"/>
Betwixt two meeting Hills, it bursts a Way,</L>
<L>Where Rocks, and Woods o'erhang the turbid Stream.</L>
<L>There gathering triple Force, rapid, and deep,</L>
<L>It boils, and wheels, and foams, and thunders thro'.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NATURE! great Parent! whose directing Hand</L>
<L>Rolls round the Seasons of the changeful Year,</L>
<L>How mighty! how majestick are thy Works!</L>
<L>With what a pleasing Dread they swell the Soul,</L>
<L>That sees, astonish'd! and, astonish'd sings!</L>
<L>You too, ye <HI>Winds!</HI> that now begin to blow,</L>
<L>With boisterous Sweep, I raise my Voice to you.</L>
<L>Where are your Stores, ye viewless <HI>Beings!</HI> say?</L>
<L>Where your aerial Magazines reserv'd,</L>
<L>Against the Day of Tempest perilous?</L>
<L>In what untravel'd Country of the Air,</L>
<L>Hush'd in still Silence, sleep you, when 'tis calm?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LATE, in the louring Sky, red, fiery, Streaks</L>
<L>Begin to flush about; the reeling Clouds</L>
<L>Stagger with dizzy Aim, as doubting yet</L>
<L>Which Master to obey: while rising, slow,</L>
<L>Sad, in the Leaden-colour'd East, the Moon</L>
<L>Wears a black Circle round her fully'd Orb.</L>
<L>Then issues forth the Storm, with loud Control,</L>
<L>And the thin Fabrick of the pillar'd Air</L>
<L>O'erturns, at once. Prone, on th' uncertain Main,</L>
<L>Descends th' Etherial Force, and plows its Waves,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="12"/>
With dreadful Rist: from the mid-Deep, appears,</L>
<L>Surge after Surge, the rising, wat'ry, War.</L>
<L>Whitening, the angry Billows rowl immense,</L>
<L>And roar their Terrors, thro' the shuddering Soul</L>
<L>Of feeble Man, amidst their Fury caught,</L>
<L>And, dash'd upon his Fate: Then, o'er the Cliff,</L>
<L>Where dwells the <HI>Sea-Mew,</HI> unconfin'd, they fly,</L>
<L>And, hurrying, swallow up the steril Shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Mountain growls; and all its sturdy <HI>Sons</HI></L>
<L>Stoop to the Bottom of the Rocks they shade:</L>
<L>Lone, on its Midnight-Side, and all aghast,</L>
<L>The dark, way-faring, <HI>Stranger,</HI> breathless, toils,</L>
<L>And climbs against the Blast—</L>
<L>Low, waves the rooted Forest, vex'd, and sheds</L>
<L>What of its leafy Honours yet remains.</L>
<L>Thus, struggling thro' the dissipated Grove,</L>
<L>The whirling Tempest raves along the Plain;</L>
<L>And, on the Cottage thacht, or lordly Dome,</L>
<L>Keen-fastening, shakes 'em to the solid Base.</L>
<L><HI>Sleep,</HI> frighted, flies; the hollow Chimney howls,</L>
<L>The Windows rattle, and the Hinges creak.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN, too, they say, thro' all the burthen'd Air,</L>
<L>Long Groans are heard, shrill Sounds, and distant Sighs,</L>
<L>That, murmur'd by the <HI>Demon</HI> of the Night,</L>
<L>Warn the devoted <HI>Wretch</HI> of Woe, and Death!</L>
<L>Wild Uproar lords it wide: the Clouds commixt,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="13"/>
With Stars, swift-gliding, sweep along the Sky.</L>
<L>All Nature reels.—But hark! the <HI>Almighty</HI> speaks:</L>
<L>Instant, the chidden Storm begins to pant,</L>
<L>And dies, at once, into a noiseless Calm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AS yet, 'tis Midnight's Reign; the weary Clouds,</L>
<L>Slow-meeting, mingle into solid Gloom:</L>
<L>Now, while the drousy World lies lost in Sleep,</L>
<L>Let me associate with the low-brow'd <HI>Night,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Contemplation,</HI> her sedate Compeer;</L>
<L>Let me shake off th' intrusive Cares of Day,</L>
<L>And lay the medling Senses all aside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND now, ye lying <HI>Vanities</HI> of Life!</L>
<L>You ever-tempting, ever-cheating Train!</L>
<L>Where are you now? and what is your Amount?</L>
<L>Vexation, Disappointment, and Remorse.</L>
<L>Sad, sickening, Thought! and yet, deluded Man,</L>
<L>A Scene of wild, disjointed, Visions past,</L>
<L>And broken Slumbers, rises, still resolv'd,</L>
<L>With new-flush'd Hopes, to run your giddy Round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FATHER of Light, and Life! Thou <HI>Good Supreme!</HI></L>
<L>O! teach me what is Good! teach me thy self!</L>
<L>Save me from Folly, Vanity and Vice,</L>
<L>From every low Pursuit! and feed my Soul,</L>
<L>With Knowledge, conscious Peace, and Vertue pure,</L>
<L>Sacred, substantial, never-fading Bliss!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
<L>LO! from the livid East, or piercing North,</L>
<L>Thick Clouds ascend, in whose capacious Womb,</L>
<L>A vapoury Deluge lies, to Snow congeal'd:</L>
<L>Heavy, they roll their fleecy World along;</L>
<L>And the Sky saddens with th' impending Storm.</L>
<L>Thro' the hush'd Air, the whitening Shower descends,</L>
<L>At first, thin-wavering; till, at last, the Flakes</L>
<L>Fall broad, and wide, and fast, dimming the Day,</L>
<L>With a continual Flow. See! sudden, hoar'd,</L>
<L>The Woods beneath the stainless Burden bow,</L>
<L>Blackning, along the mazy Stream it melts;</L>
<L>Earth's universal Face, deep-hid, and chill,</L>
<L>Is all one, dazzling, Waste. The Labourer-Ox</L>
<L>Stands cover'd o'er with Snow, and then demands</L>
<L>The Fruit of all his Toil. The Fowls of Heaven,</L>
<L>Tam'd by the cruel Season, croud around</L>
<L>The winnowing Store, and claim the little Boon,</L>
<L>That <HI>Providence</HI> allows. The foodless Wilds</L>
<L>Pour forth their brown <HI>Inhabitants</HI>; the Hare,</L>
<L>Tho' timorous of Heart, and hard beset</L>
<L>By Death, in various Forms, dark Snares, and Dogs,</L>
<L>And more unpitying Men, the Garden seeks,</L>
<L>Urg'd on by <HI>fearless</HI> Want. The bleating Kind</L>
<L>Eye the bleak Heavens, and next, the glistening Earth,</L>
<L>With Looks of dumb Despair; then sad, dispers'd,</L>
<L>Dig, for the wither'd Herb, thro' Heaps of Snow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, <HI>Shepherds,</HI> to your helpless Charge be kind;</L>
<L>Baffle the raging Year, and fill their Penns</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="15"/>
With Food, at will: lodge them below the Blast,</L>
<L>And watch them strict; for from the bellowing East,</L>
<L>In this dire Season, oft the Whirlwind's Wing</L>
<L>Sweeps up the Burthen of whole wintry Plains,</L>
<L>In one fierce Blast, and o'er th' unhappy Flocks,</L>
<L>Lodg'd in the Hollow of two neighbouring Hills,</L>
<L>The billowy Tempest whelms; till, upwards urg'd,</L>
<L>The Valley to a shining Mountain swells,</L>
<L>That curls its Wreaths amid the freezing Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, all amid the Rigours of the Year,</L>
<L>In the wild Depth of Winter, while without</L>
<L>The ceaseless Winds blow keen, be my Retreat</L>
<L>A rural, shelter'd, solitary, Scene;</L>
<L>Where ruddy Fire, and beaming Tapers join</L>

<L>Rush o'er the watry Plains, and, shuddering, view</L>
<L>The fearful Deeps below: or with the Gun,</L>
<L>And faithful Spaniel, range the ravag'd Fields,</L>
<L>And, adding to the Ruins of the Year,</L>
<L>Distress the Feathery, or the Footed <HI>Game.</HI></L>

<L>BUT hark! the nightly Winds, with hollow Voice,</L>
<L>Blow, blustering, from the South—the Frost subdu'd,</L>
<L>Gradual, resolves into a weeping Thaw.</L>
<L>Spotted, the Mountains shine: loose Sleet descends,</L>
<L>And floods the Country round: the Rivers swell,</L>
<L>Impatient for the Day.—Those sullen Seas,</L>
<L>That wash th' ungenial Pole, will rest no more,</L>
<L>Beneath the Shackles of the mighty North;</L>
<L>But, rousing all their Waves, resistless heave,—</L>
<L>And hark!—the length'ning Roar, continuous, runs</L>
<L>Athwart the rifted Main; at once, it bursts,</L>
<L>And piles a thousand Mountains to the Clouds!</L>
<L>Ill fares the Bark, the Wretches' last Resort,</L>
<L>That, lost amid the floating Fragments, moors</L>
<L>Beneath the Shelter of an Icy Isle;</L>
<L>While Night o'erwhelms the Sea, and Horror looks</L>
<L>More horrible. Can human Hearts endure</L>
<L>Th' assembled <HI>Mischiefs,</HI> that besiege them round:</L>
<L>Unlist'ning <HI>Hunger,</HI> fainting <HI>Weariness,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Roar</HI> of Winds, and Waves, the <HI>Crush</HI> of Ice,</L>
<L>Now, ceasing, now, renew'd, with louder Rage,</L>
<L>And bellowing round the Main: Nations remote,</L>
<L>Shook from their Midnight-Slumbers, deem they hear</L>
<L>Portentous Thunder, in the troubled Sky.</L>
<L>More to embroil the Deep, Leviathan,</L>
<L>And his unweildy Train, in horrid Sport,</L>
<L>Tempest the loosen'd Brine; while, thro' the Gloom,</L>
<L>Far, from the dire, unhospitable Shore,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="19"/>
The Lyon's Rage, the Wolf's sad Howl is heard,</L>
<L>And all the fell Society of Night.</L>
<L>Yet, <HI>Providence,</HI> that ever-waking <HI>Eye</HI></L>
<L>Looks down, with Pity, on the fruitless Toil</L>
<L>Of Mortals, lost to Hope, and <HI>lights</HI> them safe,</L>
<L>Thro' all this dreary Labyrinth of Fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TIS done!—Dread WINTER has subdu'd the Year,</L>
<L>And reigns, tremenduous, o'er the desart Plains!</L>
<L>How dead the Vegetable Kingdom lies!</L>
<L>How dumb the Tuneful! <HI>Horror</HI> wide extends</L>
<L>His solitary Empire.—Now, fond <HI>Man!</HI></L>
<L>Behold thy pictur'd Life: pass some few Years,</L>
<L>Thy flow'ring SPRING, thy short-liv'd SUMMER'S</L>
<L>Thy sober AUTUMN, fading ito Age,</L>
<L>And pale, concluding, WINTER shuts thy Scene, Strength,</L>
<L>And shrouds <HI>Thee</HI> in the Grave—where now, are fled</L>
<L>Those Dreams of Greatness? those unsolid Hopes</L>
<L>Of Happiness? those Longings after Fame?</L>
<L>Those restless Cares? those busy, bustling Days?</L>
<L>Those Nights of secret Guilt? those veering Thoughts,</L>
<L>Flutt'ring 'twixt Good, and Ill, that shar'd thy Life?</L>
<L>All, now, are vanish'd! <HI>Vertue,</HI> sole, survives,</L>
<L>Immortal, Mankind's never-failing Friend,</L>
<L>His Guide to Happiness on high—and see!</L>
<L>'Tis come, the Glorious <HI>Morn!</HI> the second Birth</L>
<L>Of Heaven, and Earth!—awakening <HI>Nature</HI> hears</L>
<L>Th' Almighty Trumpet's Voice, and starts to Life,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="20"/>
Renew'd, unfading. Now, th' Eternal <HI>Scheme,</HI></L>
<L>That Dark Perplexity, that Mystic Maze,</L>
<L>Which Sight cou'd never trace, nor Heart conceive,</L>
<L>To <HI>Reason</HI>'s Eye, refin'd, clears up apace.</L>
<L>Angels, and Men, astonish'd, pause—and dread</L>
<L>To travel thro' the Depths of Providence,</L>
<L>Untry'd, unbounded. Ye vain <HI>Learned!</HI> see,</L>
<L>And, prostrate in the Dust, adore that <HI>Power,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Goodness,</HI> oft arraign'd. See now the Cause,</L>
<L>Why conscious <HI>Worth,</HI> oppress'd, in secret long</L>
<L>Mourn'd, unregarded: Why the <HI>Good Man</HI>'s Share</L>
<L>In Life, was Gall, and Bitterness of Soul:</L>
<L>Why the lone <HI>Widow,</HI> and her <HI>Orphans,</HI> pin'd,</L>
<L>In starving Solitude; while <HI>Luxury,</HI></L>
<L>In Palaces, lay prompting her low Thought,</L>
<L>To form unreal Wants: why Heaven-born <HI>Faith,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Charity,</HI> prime Grace! wore the <HI>red</HI> Marks</L>
<L>Of <HI>Persecution</HI>'s Scourge: why licens'd <HI>Pain,</HI></L>
<L>That cruel <HI>Spoiler,</HI> that embosom'd <HI>Foe,</HI></L>
<L>Imbitter'd all our Bliss. Ye Good <HI>Distrest!</HI></L>
<L>Ye Noble <HI>Few!</HI> that, here, unbending, stand</L>
<L>Beneath Life's Pressures—yet a little while,</L>
<L>And all your Woes are past. <HI>Time</HI> swiftly fleets,</L>
<L>And wish'd <HI>Eternity,</HI> approaching, brings</L>
<L>Life undecaying, Love without Allay,</L>
<L>Pure flowing Joy, and Happiness sincere.</L>
