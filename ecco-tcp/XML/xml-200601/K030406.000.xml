<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>After the <HI>Danes</HI> had made themselves masters of <HI>Chippenham,</HI> the strongest city in the Kingdom of <HI>Wessex</HI>; <HI>Alfred</HI> was at once abandoned by all his subjects. In this uni∣versal defection, that Monarch found him∣self obliged to retire into the little isle of <HI>Athelney</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire</HI>; a place then rough with woods and of difficult access. There, habited like a peasant, he lived un∣known, for some time, in a shepherd's cot∣tage. He is supposed to be found in this retreat by the Earl of <HI>Devon</HI>; whose castle, upon the river <HI>Tau,</HI> was then be∣sieged by the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HERMIT.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>By silent wisdom, whose informing power</L>
<L>Works unperceiv'd: that seems in council slow;</L>
<L>But, when resolv'd and ripe for execution,</L>
<L>That parts like lightning from the secret gloom.</L>
<L>By ever seizing the right <HI>point</HI> of view,</L>
<L>Her truest interest; which she firm pursues,</L>
<L>With steady patience, thro the maze of state,</L>
<L>The storm of opposition, the mixt views,</L>
<L>And thwarting manag'd passions of mankind.</L>
<L>By healing the divisions of her people,</L>
<L>And sowing that fell pest among her soes.</L>
<L>By saving, from the vermin of a court,</L>
<L>Her treasure; which, when fair occasion calls,</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="32"/>
She knows to lavish, in protecting arts,</L>
<L>In guarding nations, and in nursing states.</L>
<L>By calling up to power, and public life,</L>
<L>Each virtue, each ability: yet <HI>she,</HI></L>
<L>Amid the various worthies glowing round her,</L>
<L>Still shines the first; the central sun that wakes,</L>
<L>That rules their every motion: not the slave,</L>
<L>And passive property of her own creatures.</L>
<L>But the great soul that animates her reign,</L>
<L>That lights it to perfection, is the love,</L>
<L>The confidence unbounded, which her wisdom,</L>
<L>Her probity and justice, shall inspire</L>
<L>Into the public breast. Hence cordial faith,</L>
<L>Which nought can shake; hence unexhausted treasure:</L>
<L>And hence, above all mercenary force,</L>
<L>The hand that by the freeborn heart is rais'd,</L>
<L>And guards the blended weal of prince and people.</L>
<L>She too shall rouse <HI>Britannia</HI>'s naval soul;</L>

<L>Known to myself alone, emerg'd at once</L>

<L>A generous few, the veteran, hardy gleanings</L>
<L>Of many a hapless fight. They with a fierce</L>
<L>And gloomy joy inspirited each other;</L>
<L>Resolv'd on death, disdaining to survive</L>
