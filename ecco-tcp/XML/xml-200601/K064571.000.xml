<HEAD>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in GOD
<HI>RICHARD,</HI>
Lord Bishop of St. DAVID'S.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N your <HI>Sermon</HI> before
the <HI>Society</HI> for Refor∣mation
of Manners,
you are pleased to give
<HI>Discourse on Christ's Miracles</HI>;
Notice of them; a <HI>Favour</HI> that
I have long'd for from a considera∣ble
<HI>Clergyman</HI>; but could nor flat∣ter
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
myself with the Hopes of receiv∣ing
it from so great a <HI>Prelate.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the inferior <HI>Clergy,</HI> whom
I despise for their Ignorance and
Malice, have before in their Con∣versation
represented me as an <HI>im∣pious</HI>
and <HI>blasphemous Infidel</HI>; and I
have met with Affronts for it: But
I never imagin'd that any, much less
your <HI>Lordship,</HI> would have ventur'd
such a Character of me from the
<HI>Press,</HI> for fear of a Resentment,
which would not be agreeable. Sure∣ly
your <HI>Lordship</HI> has not read my
<HI>Discourses,</HI> but has taken a Report
of them upon Trust, from some
Ecclesiastical <HI>Noodle</HI>; or you could
never have been so much mistaken
about my Design in them.</P>
<P>I took myself to be a Christian
of the same Faith with the Fathers
of the Church; and, without Va∣nity,
think, I have publish'd some
Tracts, in Defence of Christianity,
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
equal, if not superior to any Thing
this Age has produced. I repeat∣edly
also in my <HI>Discourses on Mira∣cles,</HI>
to obviate the Prejudices of an
ignorant <HI>Clergy,</HI> made solemn Pro∣testations
of the Sincerity of my
Design, not to do Service to Infide∣lity,
but to make Way for the De∣monstration
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiahship
from Prophecy: But all these Asseve∣rations
of the Integrity of my Heart,
it seems, stand for nothing (and I
don't wonder at it) with the <HI>Clergy,</HI>
who in their Principles, their Oaths,
and Subscriptions are so accustom'd
to prevaricate with God and Man.
I shall make no more serious Pro∣testations,
of my Faith, but expect
your <HI>Lordship</HI> should soon publish a
Defence of your foul Charge a∣gainst
me, that I may see what
Skill you have in the impious and
blasphemous Writings of an Infidel.</P>
<P>And if your <HI>railing Accusation</HI> be
not soon followed with a Disserta∣tation
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
of more Reason, I shall in∣sist
on a publick Reparation of the
Injury done to my Reputation by
your <HI>vile</HI> and <HI>slanderous</HI> Sermon;
and appeal to the worshipful <HI>Societies</HI>
for Reformation of Manners, whe∣ther
it be not just and reasonable,
you should do one or the other.</P>
<P>Now I have laid hold of your
<HI>Lordship,</HI> than whom I could not have
wish'd for an <HI>Adversary,</HI> that will
do me more Honour to overcome,
I will hold you fast; and you
must expect to be teaz'd and insul∣ted
from the <HI>Press,</HI> if you enter
not the Lists against me.</P>
<P>A clear Stage, <HI>my Lord,</HI> and no
Favour. If you have the Sword of
the Spirit in your Hand, cut as
sharply as you can with it. I had
conceiv'd a great Opinion of your
Learning, and should have been a
little apprehensive of the Power of it;
if you had not in your Sermon be∣tray'd
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
as great Weakness and Ig∣norance,
as could be in a poor <HI>Cu∣rat</HI>;
or you had never asserted that
the <HI>Greek</HI> Commentators adher'd
more strictly to the litteral Sense of
the Holy Scriptures, as if you knew
not, that St. <HI>Theophilus</HI> of <HI>Antioch,</HI>
and even <HI>Origen</HI> himself and others,
the greatest <HI>Allegorists,</HI> if a Com∣parison
may be made, were <HI>Com∣mentators</HI>
of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.</P>
<P>The sooner your Lordship appears
from the <HI>Press,</HI> the better, in as
much as you may possibly prevent
my Publication of more <HI>Discourses</HI>
of this Kind. And that it may not
be long first, I will accept of a
Dissertation from you, on any two
or three of the Miracles, I have
handled, as sufficient for all. Take
your Choice of them: but don't I
beseech you, touch the Miracle of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s driving the <HI>Buyers</HI> and <HI>Sellers</HI>
out of the Temple, because it is
a <HI>hot</HI> one, and may possibly burn
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
your Fingers. The Miracles, that
I have most ludicrously and of
consequence most offensively hand∣led,
are the two of this present
Discourse. If you please, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
let them be the easy and short
Task imposed on you. If you
can defend the Letter of the Stories
of these two Miracles, I'll quietly
give up the Rest to you.</P>
<P>So heartily thanking your Lord∣ship
for the Favour done me, in
taking Notice of my <HI>Discourses on
Miracles,</HI> which shall be turn'd to
good Use and Advantage, I sub∣scribe
myself,</P>

<HEAD>A THIRD
DISCOURSE
On The
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<HI>SAVIOUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y two former Discourses
having met with a favoura∣ble
Reception, I am encou∣rag'd
to go on and publish
another; which, without any
more Preface, I enter upon,
by a Repetition of the three general
Heads, at first proposed to be spoken to,
and they were,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="9"/>
I. To show that the Miracles of heal∣ing
all Manner of bodily Diseases, which
<HI>Jesus</HI> was justly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> neither are
they so much as a good Proof of his divine
Authority to found a Religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. To prove, that the literal History of
many of the Miracles of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as record∣ed
by the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> does imply Absur∣dities,
Improbabilities, and Incredibilities;
consequently they, either in whole or in
part, were never wrought, as they are
commonly believed now-a-days, but are
only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives of what would be mysteriously
and more wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P N="3">III. To consider, what <HI>Jesus</HI> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to
a Testimony and a Witness of his divine
Authority; and to show that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to those he
then wrought in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> but to those
Mystical ones, that he would do in the
<HI>Spirit,</HI> of which those wrought in the Flesh
are but meer Types and Shadows.</P>
<P>Tho' I have already spoken, what may
be thought sufficient, to the first of these
Heads; yet I have several Things still, both
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
from Reason and Authority, to add to it;
but having not here a convenient Place for
that Purpose, I defer it to a better Op∣portunity;
and so pass immediately to the
Resumption of my</P>
<P>II. Second general Head, and that is, to
prove, that the literal History of many of
the Miracles of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as recorded by the
<HI>Evangelists,</HI> does imply Absurdities, Im∣probabilities
and Incredibilities; conse∣quently
they, either in whole or in part
were never wrought, as it is commonly
believed now-a days, but are only related,
as prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what would be mysteriously and more
wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P>To this Purpose I have taken into Exa∣mination
six of the Miracles of <HI>Jesus, viz.</HI>
those,</P>
<P N="1">1. Of his driving the Buyers and Sel∣lers
out of the Temple.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of his exorcising the <HI>Devils</HI> out of
the Mad-men, and sending them into
the Herd of Swine.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of his Transfiguration on the Mount.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of his healing a Woman, that had an
Issue of Blood, twelve Years.</P>
<P N="5">5. Of his curing a Woman, that had a
Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen Years, and</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="4" REF="11"/>
6. Of his telling the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman
her Fortune of having had five Husbands,
and being then an Adulteress with another
Man.</P>
<P>Whether I have not prov'd the Storys
of these Miracles, either in whole or in
part, to consist of Absurdities, Improba∣bilities,
and Incredibilities, according to
the Proposition before us, I leave my <HI>Rea∣ders</HI>
to judge; and now will take in Hand</P>
<P N="7">7. A Seventh Miracle of <HI>Jesus</HI>; <HI>viz.</HI>
that <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> Chap. xxi. <HI>Mark,</HI> Chap. xi.</NOTE> <HI>of his cursing the Figtree, for not
bearing Fruit out of Season</HI>; which Miracle,
upon the bare mention of it, appears to be
such an absurd, foolish, and ridiculous, if
not malicious and ill-natured Act in <HI>Jesus,</HI>
that I question, whether, for Folly and Ab∣surdity,
it can be equalled in any Instance
of the Life of a reputed wise Man. The
Fathers, such as <HI>Origen,</HI> St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> St.
<HI>John of Jerusalem,</HI> and others, have all said
as smart Things, as the wittyest Infidels
can, against the Letter of this Story. St.
<HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hoc factum, nisi figuratum, stultum invenitur. <HI>In Serm.</HI> lxxvii.</NOTE> very plainly says, that <HI>this
Fact in Jesus,</HI> upon Supposition that it was
done, was <HI>a foolish one.</HI> If therefore I treat
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
this Story a little more ludicrously than
ordinary, and expose the Folly of the Fact
as well as of the modern Belief of it, I hope
their Authority and Example will plead
my Excuse for it.</P>
<P><HI>Jesus</HI> was hungary, it seems, and being
disappointed of Figs, to the Satisfaction of
his Appetite, cursed the Figtree. Why so
peevish and impatient? Our <HI>Divines,</HI>
when they please, make <HI>Jesus</HI> the most
patient, resign'd and easy under Sufferings,
Troubles and Disappointments, of any
Man. If he really was so, he could hard∣ly
have been so much out of Humour, for
want of a few Figs, to the Allay of his
Hunger. But to curse the Figtree upon it,
was as foolishly and passionately done,
as for another Man to throw the Chairs
and Stools about the House; because his
Dinner is not ready at a critical Time, or
before it could be got ready for him.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jesus</HI> was hungry, some will say,
and the Disappointment provoked him.
What if he was hungry? He should, as
he knew the Return of his Appetite,
have made a better and more certain
Provision for it. Where was <HI>Judas</HI> his
Steward and Caterer with his Bag of
Victuals as well as Money? Poor Fore∣cast
<PB N="6" REF="13" MS="y"/>
and Management amongst them, or
<HI>Jesus</HI> had nevet trusted to the uncertain
Fruits of a Figtree, which he espy'd at a
Distance, for his Breakfast.</P>
<P>And if <HI>Jesus</HI> was frustrated of a long'd∣for
Meal of Figs, what need he have so
reveng'd the Disappointment on the <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Nulla esset Ligni Culpa, quia Lignum sine sensu non habebat Culpam. Augustin <HI>in Serm.</HI> lxxxix.</NOTE> 
sensless and faultless Tree? Was it, be∣cause
he was forc'd to fast longer than usual
and expedient? not so, I hope neither:
Could not Angels, if he was in a desert
Place, have administred unto him? Or
could not he miraculously have created
Bread for himself and his Company, as
he multiplied or increased the Loaves for
his Thousands in the Wilderness? What
Occasion then for his being out of Hu∣mour
for want of Food? If he was of Pow∣er
to provide Bread for others on a sud∣den,
he might sure have supply'd his own
Necessities, and so have kept his Temper,
without breaking into a violent Fit of Passi∣on,
upon present Want and Disappointment.</P>
<P>But what is yet worse, <HI>the Time of
Figs was not yet,</HI> when Jesus look'd and
long'd for them. Did ever any one here
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
or read of any Thing more <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Quaerit poma; necesciebat tempus nondum esse? quod Cultor Arboris sciebat. Creator Arboris nesciebat? <HI>Augustini in Serm.</HI> lxxxix.</NOTE> unreason∣able
than for a Man to expect Fruit out of
Season? <HI>Jesus</HI> could not but know this be∣fore
he came to the Tree, and if he had
had any Consideration, he would not have
expected Figs on it, much less, if he had
regarded his own Reputation, as a wise
Man, would he have so resented the
Want of them. What, if a <HI>Yeoman</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI>
should go to look for <HI>Pipins</HI> in his Orchard
at <HI>Easter,</HI> (the supposed Time <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Hoc ideo probamus, quia Passionis Domini Dies propinquabat, et scimus quo tempore passus sit. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> that
<HI>Jesus</HI> sought for these Figs) and, because
of a Disappointment, cut down all his
Trees? What then would his Neighbours
make of him? Nothing less, than a <HI>Laugh∣ing-Stock</HI>;
and if the Story got into our
publick News, he would be the Jest and
Ridicule of Mankind. How <HI>Jesus</HI> salv'd
his Credit upon this his wild Prank;
and prevented the Laughter of the <HI>Scribes</HI>
and <HI>Pharisees</HI> upon it, I know not; but I can∣not
think of this Part of the Letter of this
Story, without smiling at it at this Day;
and wonder our <HI>Divines</HI> are not laugh'd
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
out of Countenance for reading it gravely,
and having <HI>Jesus</HI> in Admiration for it.</P>
<P>Again, I would gladly know, whose Fig∣tree
this was, and whether <HI>Jesus</HI> had any
legal Right to the Fruit, if haply he had
found any on it, or any Leave or Authority
to smite it with a Curse for its Unfruitful∣ness?
As to the Tree's being <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Pro∣perty,
that could not be. For he was so
far from being either Landlord or Tenant,
that it's said he had not where to lay his
Head. During the Time of his Ministry,
he was but a Wanderer, like a Mendicant
Fryar, or an itenerant Preacher, and before
that Time was no better than a Journey∣man
Carpenter (of whose Workmanship, I
wonder, the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has no holy
Relicks, not so much as a Three-footed-stool,
or a Pair of Nutcrackers;) conse∣quently
he had no House nor Land of his
own by Law, much less any Figtree, and
least of all <HI>this</HI> which he espy'd at a di∣stance
in his Travels. How then had he
any Right to the Figs, if he had met with
any? I hope he ask'd Leave beforehand of
the Proprietor, or <HI>Infidels</HI> will say of him,
that if he had had an Opportunity he
would have been a <HI>Rob-Orchard.</HI> And if
he had no Right to the Fruit, much less to
smite the Tree with a Curse; where was
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
his Honour, <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Arbor non est justé siccata. <HI>Johan Hierosol in Loc. Marci.</HI></NOTE> his Justice, his Good∣ness,
and his Honesty in this Act? The <HI>E∣vangelists,</HI>
if they would have us to think,
<HI>Jesus</HI> did no wrong to any Man, should
have left us somewhat upon Record, to Sa∣tisfaction,
in this Case; or <HI>Infidels,</HI> who
have here Scope for it, will think worse
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> than possibly he may deserve.
Whether <HI>Jesus,</HI> modestly speaking, met
with any Blame or Reprimand from the
Proprietor, for his Act of Execration, none
can affirm or deny. But if any one so
spitefully and maliciously should destroy
almost any other Tree, whether fruitful
or not, of another Man's, in this Coun∣try,
he would have good Luck, if he e∣scaped
the House of Correction for it.</P>
<P>And what now have our <HI>Divines</HI> to say,
to all this Reasoning against the Letter of
this Story? Nothing more than "That
the Act of cursing the Figtree, whe∣ther
it be at this Distance of Time re∣concileable
to Reason, Justice and Pru∣dence
or not, was a supernatural Work,
above the Power of Nature or Art to
imitate, consequently it was a Miracle,
and they will admire and adore <HI>Jesus</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
for it." And to agree with them at
present, that it was a real Miracle, and
a supernatural Event, yet I hope, they'll
acknowledge, that if <HI>Jesus,</HI> as St. <HI>Au∣gustin</HI>
 <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Si miraculum fuerat tantummodo commen∣dandum, et non alquid prophetice figurandum, multo clementiùs dominus et sua misericordia dig∣niùs fecerat, Si quam aridam invenerit, viridem red∣deret, sicut languentes sanavit. Tunc vero e con∣trario, quasi adversus Regulam Clementiae suae in∣venit Arborem virentem, praeter tempus fructus nondum habentem, non tamen fructum agricolae ne∣gantem, et aridam fecit. <HI>In Serm.</HI> lxxxix <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE> says, had, instead of cursing the
Figtree, made a dry, dead and withered
one, immediately to bud, flourish and re∣vive,
and in an Instant to bring forth
ripe Fruits, out of Season, it would have
pleased them much better. Such an In∣stance
of his Power had been an indis∣putable
Miracle: Such an Instance of his
divine Power had carry'd Goodness along
with it, and none of the foresaid Excep∣tions
could have been made to it: Such
an Instance of his Almighty Power, had
been a Demonstration of his being Lord
of the Creation, and Author of the Fruits
of the Earth for the Use of Man, in
their Season, or he could not have pro∣duced
them out of Season. In such
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
an Instance of Power, his divine Care
and Providence against Hunger and Want
would have been visible; and it would
have been an Admonition to us, to de∣pend
daily upon him for the Comforts
and Necessaries of Life: Such an Instance
of his Power would have been, as St.
<HI>Augustin</HI> says above, like his Miracles of
healing Diseases, of making the Languid,
<HI>Sound</HI>; and the Feeble, <HI>Strong</HI>; and we
might more certainly have infer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from
one with the other, that both were the
Operations of a good God. But this
Instance of his cursing the Figtree in this
Fashion spoils the Credit, and sullies the
Glory of his other Miracles. It is in its own
Nature of such a malevolent Aspect, that
its enough to make us suspect the Bene∣ficence
of <HI>Christ</HI> in his other Works, and to
question whether there might not be some
latent Poyson and diabolical Design under
the Colour of his fairer Pretences to Al∣mighty
Power. It is so like the malignant
Practices of <HI>Witches,</HI> who, as Stories go,
upon Envy, Grudge, or Distaste, smite
their Neighbours Cattle with languishing
Distempers, till they die, that it's hard,
if not impossible, to distinguish one from
the other in Spite and Malice. If <HI>Maho∣met,</HI>
and not <HI>Jesus,</HI> had been the Author
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
of this Miracle, our <HI>Divines</HI> would pre∣sently
have discover'd the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Foot
in it, and have said that <HI>Satan</HI> drew him
into a Scrape, in the Execution of this
mad and foolish Frolick, on purpose to ex∣pose
<HI>him</HI> for a <HI>Wizard</HI> and <HI>his</HI> Mussel∣men
of all Ages since for Fools in be∣lieving
on him. The Spirit of <HI>Christ,</HI>
who is all Love and Mercy, should, one
Would think, breath forth nothing but
Goodness and Kindness to Mankind; but
that such a pestilential Blast, like a morti∣ferous
North-East Wind in some Seasons,
should proceed from his Mouth, to the
Destruction of another Man's harmless and
inossensive Tree, is what none upon Earth
can account for.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Divines,</HI> one or other of them,
have publish'd several notable Notions a∣bout
Miracles, and have laid down good
Rules to distinguish <HI>true</HI> from <HI>false</HI> ones;
but none of them, as far as I perceive,
have taken any Pains to shew the Con∣sistence
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles to their own
Rules and Notions. Mr. <HI>Chandler,</HI>(who
as the <HI>Archbishop</HI> <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">See Arch-bishop <HI>Wake</HI>'s Letter to Mr. <HI>Chand∣ler,</HI> which is handed about Town and Country.</NOTE> says, has rightly
stated the Notion of a Miracle) among
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
his Rules of judging by whom Miracles
are perform'd, says, <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Vindication of the Christian Religion, p. 82</NOTE> <HI>That the Things
pretended to be done, are to be such, as that
it is consistent with the Perfections of God
to interest himself in</HI>; and again, <HI>they must
be such as answer to the Character of God
as a good and gracious Being</HI>; and again,
<HI>It seems reasonable to believe, that whenever
the first and best of Beings is pleased to send
an extraordinary Messenger with a Revela∣tion
of his Will, he will furnish him with
such Proofs of his Mission, as may argue
not only the Power of him in whose Name
he comes, but his Love to Mankind, and his
Inclination to do them good.</HI> I have no Dis∣like
to these Notions of Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI>;
but as it is not to be questioned, that he
(and the <HI>Archbishop</HI> too) had this Mira∣cle
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s cursing the Figtree, and
some others, as of <HI>his boisterous driving
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple</HI>;
of <HI>his sending the Devils into the Herd
of Swine</HI>; of <HI>his turning Water into Wine
for the Use of Men, who had before well
drank,</HI> &amp;c. in his View, when he gave
forth the foresaid Rules; for acute and
learned Writers in Theology are supposed
to have their Wits about them; so it is
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
to be hop'd that he or the <HI>Archbishop</HI> will
soon publish somewhat to reconcile these
Miracles of <HI>Jesus</HI> to their own Notions;
tho' I don't expect it before <HI>latter Lam∣mas.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, it may be questioned, if
Infidels should go about it, whether this
Work of <HI>Jesus</HI> was miraculous; and whe∣ther
there was not more of the Craft of
Man, than of the Power of God in it;
or to use Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> Words,
Whether it don't <HI>look like the little Tricks
and cunning Deceits of Impostors.</HI> St. <HI>Mat∣thew</HI>
says, <HI>presently the Figtree withered
away</HI>; but this <HI>presently</HI> is an indetermi∣nate
Time, and may be understood of a
Day, or a Week or two, as well as of the
Moment in which the Words were spoken;
<HI>Let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for
ever.</HI> St. <HI>Mark</HI> says, <HI>that in the Morning
as the Disciples passed by, they saw the
Figtree dry'd up from the Roots,</HI> which
was at least the Day <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Quod sequenti die viderint exa∣ruisse ficum. <HI>Theophylact. in Locum Marci.</HI></NOTE> after the Curse
was utter'd, so that there was certainly
four and twenty Hours for its withering;
and if it is said that the <HI>Tree dry'd up from
the Roots,</HI> it does not imply that the
Trunk of it perish'd or was reduc'd to
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
nothing; but only that the green Leaves
of the Whole, and of every Part of it,
were in a withering Condition: And might
not all this be done without a Miracle?
What if <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> should say, that
<HI>Jesus,</HI> being minded to impose on his Dis∣ciples
and Followers, took a secret Op∣portunity
beforehand to lay his Capen∣ter's
Ax to the Root of this Tree, and so
imperceptibly circumcised it, as that the
Leaves did, what they will do, wither in
a Night and a Day's Time. God forbid,
that I should think, <HI>Jesus</HI> did so; but as
to the Possibility of such a Fraud in an
Impostor, none can doubt of it.</P>
<P>I am so far from thinking there was any
such Fraud in this supposed Miracle of <HI>Je∣sus,</HI>
that I don't believe it was at all done
by him according to the Letter: And for
this I have not only a clear and intrinsick
Proof from the Story itself; but the Autho∣rity
of the Fathers. St <HI>Ambrose,</HI> treating on
the Parable of the Figtree in <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiii.</NOTE> St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> intimates, that what St. <HI>Matthew</HI>
and St. <HI>Mark</HI> write of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s cursing the
Figtree, is but <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Quid sibi vult, quod in Evangelio suo Dominus Fici Parabolam <HI>frequen∣ter</HI> inducit: Habes enim alibi, quod jussu Domini Viriditas omnis hujus Ligni frondentis aurerit. <HI>In Loc. Lucae.</HI></NOTE> Part of the same Pa∣rable.
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
And St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">Vidiamus, ubi alibi scriptum de ist a ficu; in Evangelio secundum Lucam legimus, &amp;c. <HI>In Loc. Marci. Hom.</HI> xii.</NOTE> 
says expressly enough, that the three <HI>E∣vangelists</HI>
write of one and the same Fig∣tree,
consequently parabolically, and that,
what St <HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Mark</HI> write of
it, was no more a literal Transaction, than
the Parable in St. <HI>Luke.</HI> Thanks to these
holy Fathers for their ridding us of the
Belief of the Letter of this Story, which
otherwise might have perplex'd us with its
Absurdities before urg'd. And to their
Opinion I desire it may be added and con∣sidered,
whether it be not as reasonable
in itself to take what the three <HI>Evange∣lists</HI>
write of this Figtree, as Part of one
Story, as well as, what they write of the
<HI>Woman with her Issue of Blood,</HI> and of
<HI>Jesus's casting the Devils out of the Mad∣men,</HI>
and of other Miracles which are but
several Relations of the same Story, Para∣ble
or Miracle. Neither is it any Argu∣ment
for a literal Transaction of this Mi∣racle,
that, the <HI>Evangelists</HI> speak of it, as a
Thing done: For, as <HI>Origen</HI> says, there are
some Things spoken of in the <HI>Evangelists,</HI>
as Facts, which were never transacted; so
it is of the Nature of Prophecy (and our
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
Saviour in his whole Life prophesied) to
speak of Things to come, as if they were
already past; because such Prophecies are
not to be understood till after their Ac∣complishment,
and then the Reason of
the Use of the <HI>praeter,</HI> instead of the <HI>fu∣ture</HI>
Tense, in Prophecy, will be visible.
But what, in my Opinion, is an abso∣lute
Demonstration, that there's no Truth
in the Letter of this Story, is, what our
Saviour adds, upon the Disciples wonder∣ing
at the sudden withering of the Figtree,
saying, <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> Chap. xxi. 21.</NOTE> <HI>that if they had Faith,</HI>
<HI>they should not only do what was done to the
Figtree</HI>; <HI>but should say to this Mountain,</HI>
(that was near him, I suppose) <HI>be thou
removed and cast into the Sea, and it shall
be done.</HI> But these Things were never lit∣terally
done by them, consequently <HI>Jesus</HI>
himself did not litterally curse the Figtree;
or the Disciples wanted Faith for the
doing the said Miracles, which is an Ab∣surdity
to suppose; or <HI>Jesus</HI> talked idly
of a Promise to invest them with a Power.
they were never to be possess'd of. But of
what ill Consequence to Religion, either
of these Suppositions is, let the old Ob∣jection
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
in <HI>Paschasius Ratbertus</HI> <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Quanquam igitur juxta Literam haec facta non legantur ab Apostolis, sicut quidam Paganorum calumniati sunt, et garriunt contra nos, etiam in suis scriptis asserentes Apostolos non habuisse fidem, quia montes non transtulerunt neque Ficulneas verbo exsic∣carunt. <HI>In Loc. Matth.</HI></NOTE> speak;
which I shall not stay here to urge and
revive; but only say at present, that if
<HI>Jesus</HI> actually cursed a Figtree, his Disci∣ples
ought to have done so too, and to re∣move
Mountains. If we adhere to the
Letter in one Case, we must in the other
also; but we are only to look to the
Mystery in both, or St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Legimus Apostolorum miracula, nusquam autem legimus arborem ab his are∣factam, aut montem in mare translatum; quaera∣mus ergo in mysterio ubi factum sit, non enim Verba Domini vacare potuerant. <HI>In Serm.</HI> lxxxix.</NOTE> will
tell us, that <HI>Jesus</HI> utter'd vain, empty and
insignificant Words and Promises.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> who believes no more
of the Letter of this Story, than I do, says,
that Works of <HI>Jesus</HI> are all figurative
and of a spiritual Signification, which is so
manifest from his Act of cursing the Figtree,
as Men must, <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Sed futurum aliquid Miraculo commendasse, multa sunt quae nos admoneant, nobis{que} persuadeant, imo ab <HI>invitis</HI> exterqueant. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> <HI>whether, they will or
not</HI> acknowledge it. But he is mistaken:
Tho' there might be none in his Time
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
who would question, that this supposed
Fact of <HI>Jesus</HI> had a mystical Significati∣on
yet if he had liv'd in our Days, he
would have met with <HI>Divines,</HI> who, for all
the foresaid Absurdities and their Cogen∣cy
to drive us to Allegory, do adhere to
the Letter only, whether the Truth, Cre∣dibility
and Reasonableness of it be defen∣sible
or not. But then to do Justice to
St. <HI>Augustin</HI>'s Assertion, he would have
met with others, who <HI>against their Wills,</HI>
interpret this Miracle figuratively, such
as Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> and Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> who
say, <HI>Jesus</HI> cursed the Figtree by way of
Type of the Destruction of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
State, which declined and wasted away
after the Similitude of this withering Tree.
But why then don't these <HI>Commentators</HI> al∣legorically
interpret and apply other Mi∣racles
of our Saviour? Because they think
the Letter will stand good and abide the
Test without an Allegory. And why do they
allegorise this Miracle only? Because of
the Dificulties and Absurdities of the Let∣ter,
which they can't account for. And
are these Reasons good? No, certainly:
The <HI>Evangelists</HI> should have made the Dis∣tinction
for them. They should have told
us, which Miracles are to be allegoris'd
and mystically applied, and which are not;
or we are to allegorise all or none at all.
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
how came these modern Allegorists of this
Miracle to apply it as they do, and to
make it a mystical Representation of the
Ruin of the <HI>Jewish</HI> State? Did they take
up this Notion of their own Heads, or did
they borrow it of the Fathers? Why in all
Probability they took the Hint from the
Fathers; wherefore then don't they, what
none of them do, cite and acknowledge
their Authors for it? Because, like Men
of Subtilty, they would be thought to
devise it of themselves; for if they had quo∣ted
the Fathers for it, the Fathers would
have oblig'd them, upon their Authority,
to allegorise the rest of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles,
in the way that I have interpreted some of
them; but this would not have agreed with
their Stomachs for many Reasons. No
Thanks then to the aforsaid <HI>Commenta∣tors</HI>
for their allegorical Application of this
Miracle, which they are again to desert,
or abide the Consequence of allegorising
others also, which for their Interests and
Reputations they will not do. Therefore
let them return again to the Letter of
this Miracle, and say for it, what is all
that is to be said for it, with <HI>Victor An∣tiochenus,</HI>
an Apostatical Writer of the
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
fifth Century, <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Porro quando in hunc locum incidimus. nemo curiosè inquirat, aut anxie disputet, justene an &amp; s;ecus factum sit; sed Miraculum editum contem∣pletur et admiretur.

Passage of Scripture concerning the Figtree</HI>
Jesus <HI>cursed we ought not curiously to en∣quire

and admire this Miracle, as well as
that of</HI> Jesus'<HI>s drowning the Swine, not∣withstanding
some think it void of the Face
of Justice.</HI> Ay, ay, our <HI>Divines</HI> must al∣legorise
all <HI>Jesus</HI>' s Miracles, or betake
themselves to this Opinion of <HI>Victor</HI>; which
this <HI>free-thinking</HI> Age will hardly let them
quietly rest in. So, supposing our <HI>Di∣vines</HI>
to be, what they generally are, still
Ministers of the Absurdity of the Letter,
I pass to the Consideration of the Autho∣rity
of the Fathers, and to see, whether
we can't learn of them this Parable of the
Figtree.</P>
<P>Who or what is meant by the Figtree
seems not to be agreed among the Fathers;
or, more properly speaking, they are not
agreed, all of them to apply it always to
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
one and the same Thing. Some, as <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Quid Arbor fici, nisi humanam naturam designet? <HI>In Homil.</HI> xxxi.</NOTE> 
<HI>Gregory</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> say Human Nature
or Mankind is typified by the Figtree.
Others, as <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">In Ficu, Sy∣nogogae positum Exemplum est. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Hilary,</HI> say the
<HI>Jewish</HI> Church or State is meant by it.
Others, as <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">Absit a nobis, ut, Jesu veniènte ad nos et vo∣lente manducare de ficu (<HI>Ecclesiae</HI>) non inveniatur Fru∣ctus in ea. <HI>In Matth. Tract.</HI> xxx.</NOTE> <HI>Origen</HI> say, it is a Type
of the Church of Christ. So do the Fa∣thers
seem to be divided in their Opinions;
but it is without any Difference or Incon∣sistency
with each other. For as there is,
according to the Fathers, Mystery upon
Mystery in all the Actions of <HI>Jesus</HI>; so
I believe the Figtree here, as a Type, may
be properly enough apply'd to the foresaid
three Purposes. And if the Fathers had
been ask'd their Opinion in this Case, I
dare say, they would have said so too.
This is certain that <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Pote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> autem ficus illa intelligi populus Circumcisionis. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> under∣stands
it as applicable to the <HI>Jewish</HI> as
well as the <HI>Christian</HI> Church. And St.
<HI>Augustin,</HI> as Occasion offers itself, takes
it in the foresaid three Senses. When they
understand it as a Type of all Mankind,
they say that the <HI>three Years</HI> of its Un∣fruitfulness
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
are to be interpreted of the
 <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Arbor ficulnea Genus humanum est,—Triennium autem tria sunt Tempora, unum aute Legem, alterum sub Lege, tertium sub gratia. <HI>St. Augustin in Serm.</HI> cx.</NOTE> <HI>three grand Periods</HI> of the World;
the <HI>one</HI> before the Law of <HI>Moses</HI>; <HI>another</HI>
under the Law; and the <HI>third</HI> under the
Gospel; at the Conclusion of which <HI>third</HI>
Period, as it was an ancient and common
Opinion, <HI>Jesus</HI> in Spirit would come to
his Figtree of Mankind, and animadvert
on them for their Unfruitfulness, not by
any Destruction of human Nature, but by
a Cessation of its Unfruitful State, which
then will wither away, and be turn'd into a
fruitful one against the grand Sabbath, or
acceptable Year, which is the Year signi∣fied
in the Parable, <HI>that it is to be let alone
to bring forth Fruit in.</HI> They that under∣stand
the Figtree as a Type of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
State, mean by the <HI>three Years Jesus</HI> came
to it, the <HI>three Years</HI> of his preaching a∣mong
the <HI>Jews</HI>; at the End of which, af∣ter
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Passion and Resurrection, the
<HI>Jewish</HI> State, like the Figtree, withered a∣way,
and, for its Unfruitfulness, was root∣ed
up. They that understand the Figtree
as a Figure of the Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> by
the <HI>three Years,</HI> mean the apocalyptical
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
<HI>twelve hundred and sixty Days</HI> (that is,
three Years and a half) of the Church's
barren and unfruitful State in the Wilder∣ness,
at the Conclusion of which, the Fa∣thers
say <HI>Jesus</HI> will come again to his
Church or Figtree, seeking Fruit on it.</P>
<P>Some perhaps may be ready here to
interpose with a Question, and say, how
will <HI>Jesus</HI> then come to his Church? I
have carefully perused the Fathers upon
this Question, and can't find that they
mean any more by <HI>Christ</HI>'s second or spi∣ritual
Advent, than that clear <HI>Truth,</HI> right
<HI>Reason</HI> and divine <HI>Wisdom</HI> (which are the
mystical Names of <HI>Jesus</HI>) will descend up∣on
the Church, on the Clouds of the
Law and the Prophets, to the Removal
of her unfruitful and unprofitable Errors,
and to enable her to bring forth the Fruits
of the Spirit, against the grand Sabbath.
Neither can any reasonable Man con∣ceive
how otherwise <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jude,</HI> ver. 14.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord should
come,</HI> (not <HI>with ten thousand of his Saints,</HI>
as our Translation has it, but) <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
that is, as <HI>Origen</HI> interprets, <HI>in
his holy thousands of</HI> Allegorists <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>to criticise upon all</HI> the Scripture, and
to convince <HI>Ministers of the Letter</HI> of their
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
abominable Errors, and of their horrid
Blasphemies spoken, preach'd, and prin∣ted
against the Holy (Ghost or) Spirit
of the Law and Prophets. As to that
litteral and common Pulpit-Story (with
all its Appendages) of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s second Com∣ing
on aetherial Clouds, as on a Wool∣sack,
in his human, tho' glorious and ma∣jestick
Appearance, for the Resurrection
of Mens Bodies, by Sound of a Trumpet,
in the Audience of the Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is the
most absurd, nonsensical and unphilosophi∣cal,
(such groundless and worthless Stuff
have the <HI>Clergy</HI> sold and preach'd to God's
People!) that ever was told against Reason,
against prophetick and evangelical Scrip∣ture,
and against other ancient and good
Authority. It is no Place here to multiply
Testimonies and Arguments to either of
these Purposes, which my Readers, if they
do but attend, will see no Occasion for.
But if our <HI>Divines</HI> should think I have
put a false Gloss on the Text of St. <HI>Jude</HI>
above, I have a Bundle of Arguments and
Testimonies to produce in Defence of it,
at their Service.</P>
<P>In the Parable of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> it is said,
<HI>Lo, these three Years come I seeking Fruit on
this Figtree</HI>; as if <HI>Jesus</HI> came annually and
successively for <HI>three Years</HI> together; but
according to the Original, it ought to be
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
read, <HI>Lo, it is three Years and 1 now come,</HI>
or <HI>Lo, the three Years are now past, and I
come.</HI> And here it is to be noted, that
whether we understand the Figtree, as a
Figure of the Church in particular, or of
Mankind in general; the mystical Num∣ber
of <HI>three Years</HI> will terminate about
the same Time, against the Evangelical
Sabbath, on which the Unfruitfulness of
the Church, or of Mandind, according to
the Fathers, is to have an End put to it.</P>
<P>And <HI>Jesus,</HI> when he came to the Fig∣tree:
<HI>found nothing thereon but Leaves on∣ly:</HI>
So <HI>Jesus,</HI> when he comes to his Church,
will find nothing in her but Leaves only.
And what is here meant by Leaves? Let
the Fathers, such as <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Inveniet infaecundam, foliis tantomodo vesti∣tam, id est Verbis inanibus gloriantem, sed fructi∣bus vacuam, Operibus quippe bonis sterilem. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Hilary,</HI> St.
<HI>John</HI> <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Habentem folia et non fructus; Verba, non Sensus; Scripturas, non intelligentiam Scripturarum <HI>In Loc.

Matt.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Theo∣phylact</HI>
tell us, who by Leaves understand
a vain and empty Appearance of Wis∣dom
and good Works, or the Words and
Letter of the Scriptures, which are the
Leaves of the Oracle, without any Figs of
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
spiritual Interpretations of them. And whe∣her
this ben't the Case of the Church at
present, our <HI>Divines</HI> are to consider. The
Figs that <HI>Jesus</HI> may be supposed to look
for at his Coming, are not only the Fruits
of the Spirit mention'd by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> but
 <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Quaerens non Sensiles Fructus sed intellecti∣lem ex Lege et Prophetis dulcem{que} Faecundiratem. <HI>Caesarii in Dialog.</HI> 40.</NOTE> <HI>spiritual Interpretations</HI> of the Scrip∣tures,
which St. <HI>Jerome</HI> <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Ficus sunt dona dulcissima Spiritus Sancti, Spiritualia dogmata et Scientia Scripturarum. <HI>In Agg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/> Cap.</HI> ii.</NOTE> says are
<HI>mystical Figs</HI>; because, as ripe Figs are
sweet to the Palate of our Mouths, so are
they no less delicious to the Soul of Man.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jesus</HI> is said to be <HI>hungry</HI> after
Figs: so will <HI>Jesus</HI> in Spirit <HI>hunger</HI> for
the mystical Figs of his Church, that is,
as <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">Esuriit autem Jesus semper in justis, volens manducare Fructum Spiritus Sancti in eis. <HI>In Matt. Tract.</HI> XXX.</NOTE> rightly interprets, he will
earnestly desire, like a Man that is hun∣gry,
the Fruits of the Spirit in his Church,
which will be as grateful to him as Figs
can be to a Man naturally. To understand
this Expression of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>Hunger</HI> literally, is
such a mean Circumstance of Life, that
unless it be, what's next to impossible, ne∣cessarily
introductory to some noble Trans∣action,
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
it's unfit to be remember'd of a
Saint in History. <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> would
have disdain'd to mention such a frivolous
Circumstance in the Life of a Philosopher
as <HI>this</HI> of <HI>Jesus.</HI> But if we understand
this <HI>Hunger</HI> in <HI>Jesus</HI> mystically, and fi∣guratively
of his Desires of the Fruits of
the Spirit in his Church, it is sublime
and noble; and the Emblem confessedly
proper and instructive.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jesus</HI> is said to come to the Fig∣tree
at an unseasonable Time; <HI>For the
Time of Figs was not yet</HI>; which Expres∣sion
has been the Perplexity of <HI>Commen∣tators,</HI>
who with all their Wit and Saga∣city
can't get well over it. I shall not
mention here all or any of their pretend∣ed
Solutions of this Difficulty; but let us
see whether we can't easily and at once
unlose it. St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Words are <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
which are and have been
commonly translated, <HI>for the Time of Figs
is not yet.</HI> But if we change the <HI>Point</HI>
into an <HI>Interrogation,</HI> and read thus, <HI>for
was it not the Time of Figs?</HI> the Difficulty
vanishes as certainly, as that it is absurd
to suppose <HI>Christ</HI> should come to his Fig∣tree
and look for Fruit, when he could
not reasonably expect any. This my So∣lution
of this Difficulty certainly serves
the Purpose of the mystical Interpretati∣on;
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
and if it does not the litteral, I an∣swer,
we are not to heed the Letter, which
seldom or never has any Sense or Truth
in it. But, by the by, it does the litte∣ral
too, since there are no Grounds from
the Text to think, what has been the
common Opinion, that it was about the
<HI>Jewish</HI> Passover that <HI>Jesus</HI> came to the
Figtree. If this my Solution of the Dif∣ficulty
don't please, I must say with <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Ad quem (Locum) intelligendum, ut opor∣tet, expectandum esse Eliae, ut nonnu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quam lo∣quuntur Veteres de Locis obscurissimis Adventum. <HI>In Exercitat. Sac. Lib.</HI> ii. <HI>cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> 
<HI>Heinsius,</HI> that it must be left as a Knot
for <HI>Elias</HI> to untie, who, according to the
 <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Fructus dulces omne genus de arbore Vitae comedendum praebebit Elias. <HI>Apud Buxtorf. Sy∣nag. p.</HI> 738.</NOTE> ancient <HI>Jews,</HI> is first to gather Fruits
off this mystical Figtree, and present them
to the intellectual Taste of Mankind.
But, that my Solution is good, will appear
by what follows.</P>
<P>And <HI>Jesus</HI> finding Leaves only says,
in St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> to the Figtree, <HI>Let no
Fruit grow on thee henceforward for e∣ver</HI>;
which (with its parallel Place in St.
<HI>Mark</HI>) is in my Opinion a false Transla∣tion:
The Original is, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and ought to be
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
englished, <HI>not as yet,</HI> or <HI>not untill now,</HI>
(that I came) <HI>against the</HI> (grand) <HI>Age</HI> (of
the Sabbath) has Fruit grown on thee. So
that the Miracle of <HI>Jesus</HI> was to make
the Figtree of the Church fruitful; and
if her preceeding unfruitful State, which
(in St. <HI>Mark</HI>) <HI>Jesus</HI> is said to curse, or ra∣ther
to devote to Ruin, wasted away, it
was by Consequence.</P>
<P>But what Time of Day was it that
<HI>Jesus</HI> came to the Figtree? It was in the
<HI>Morning.</HI> And of what Day? That is un∣certain
as to the Letter, but according to
the mystical Extent of the <HI>Three Years,</HI> whe∣ther
we understand the Figtree as a Type
of the Church, or of all Mankind of all
Ages, it will be on the <HI>Morning</HI> of the
great Sabbath, when, upon the Appearance
of the Light of Christ, like the Rising of
the Sun, an unfruitful and erroneous
Church must needs wither away. And
the Disciples on the said <HI>Morning</HI> will,
as <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">Oculis Spiritalibus viderunt Mysterium fici siccatae. <HI>Matt. Tract.</HI> xvi.</NOTE> says, with their intellectu∣al
Eyes behold her waste with Admirati∣on.
And then too, they under Christ
<HI>will do what is done to the Figtree,</HI> of the
Church, and <HI>remove Mountains</HI> of Anti∣christian
Power, that exalt themselves a∣gainst
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
him, as the Fathers interpret, and
I need not explain.</P>
<P>And what is meant by the Means, which
St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks of, to make the Figtree
of the Church fruitful on the Sabbatical
Year; <HI>the Year it is to be let alone to
bear Fruit in?</HI> There must be <HI>digging a∣bout
it,</HI> that is <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Effodientes Literam Legis. <HI>Cyril. Glaphyr.</HI> L. 1. P1.</NOTE> into the Earth of the
Letter of the Scriptures, and <HI>dunging</HI> of
it, that is calling <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">Mittitur ergo Cophinus Stercoris ad Radi∣cem Arboris, quando pravitatis suae Conscientia tan∣gitur memoria Cogitationis. <HI>Gregor. M. in Hom.</HI> xxxi.</NOTE> to Remembrance her
Sins and Errors of the Time past, which
rationally speaking will make the Church
to bring forth good Fruit.</P>
<P>After this Fashion is the rest of the Pa∣rable
of the Figtree to be allegorized out
of the Fathers. St. <HI>Gregory</HI> <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">Sed hoc significat Ficulnea infructuosa, quod Mulier inclinata; et hoc Ficulnea reservata, quod Mulier erecta. Hoc autem et octodecem Annorum Numero signatur, quod tertio die Dominus Vineae Ficulneam venisse perhibetur. <HI>In Homil.</HI> xxxi.</NOTE> the <HI>Great,</HI>
and St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> make these two Stories
or Parables, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Figtree, and of
the Woman with her <HI>Spirit of Infirmity,</HI>
as they are blended together in St. <HI>Luke,</HI>
to be Figures of the same Mystery. The
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
<HI>eighteen Years</HI> of the Woman's Infirmity
and the <HI>three Years</HI> of the Figtree's Un∣fruitfulness,
they will have to be mysti∣cally
synchromical. And the Woman's <HI>In∣curvity</HI>
to the Earth is, they say, signifi∣cative
of the same Thing with the <HI>Un∣fruitfulness</HI>
of the Figtree. And the <HI>E∣rection</HI>
of the Woman on the Sabbath is of
the same Import with the <HI>Reservation</HI> of
the Tree for Fruitfulness on that Day.
And let any one see, if they don't admi∣rally
agree, as I have interpreted these
two Parables.</P>
<P>Before I dismiss this Story of the Fig∣tree,
I can't but adore the Providence of
God, that the Miracle has been hitherto
placed in the withering away of the Tree.
If the Miracle had been a plain Story of
a dead and wither'd Tree's being made
to bring forth Leaves and Fruit on a sud∣den;
this would have been such a mani∣festly
supernatural Work, and so agreea∣ble
to modern Notionists about Miracles,
that Mens Thoughts would have been so
absorpt in the Consideration of the Letter,
as they would never have extended them
to the Contemplation of the Mystery. And
our Divines would have made such a Noise,
in our Ears of the Excellency and Mar∣vellousness
of such a Miracle, as that
there would be no bearing of it. But
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
But as the <HI>Evangelists</HI> have in a good
Measure suppress'd all mention of the af∣ter
Fruitfulness of the Tree; and the Sto∣ry,
by Misconstruction, is clog'd with the
foresaid Difficulties and Absurdities, we
are of Necessity driven to the search after
Mystery for good Sense and Truth in it.</P>
<P>And thus have I spoken enough to the
Miracle of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s cursing the Figtree,
which according to the Letter is a foolish
and absurd Story: But the mystical
Operation, of which the Letter is a
Shadow, will be ravishing, marvelous
and stupendous; and not only a Proof
of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Power and Presence in his
Church, but a Demonstration of his <HI>Messi∣ahship,</HI>
in as much as an infinite Num∣ber
of Prophecys upon Prophecys, will
thereupon be discern'd to be accom∣plish'd,
or the Church can't bring forth
the Fruits of the Spirit, that is Spiritu∣al
Interpretations of the Scriptures, like
ripe Figs. And so I pass to an</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Eighth</HI> Miracle of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and that
is, <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot"><HI>John,</HI> Chap. v.</NOTE> "of his healing a Man of an
Infirmity, of thirty eight Years Dura∣tion,
at the Pool of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> that had
five Porches, in which lay a great Mul∣titude
of impotent Folk, blind, halt,
withered, waiting the troubling of the
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
Waters, upon the Descent of an An∣gel,
who gave a Sanative Virtue to them,
to the curing of any one, be his Distem∣per
of what kind soever, who first
stept down into them."</P>
<P>This whole Story is what our Saviour
calls a <HI>Camel</HI> of a monstrous Size for
Absurdities, Improbabilities and Incredi∣bilities,
which our <HI>Divines,</HI> and their im∣plicit
Followers of these last Ages, have
swallowed without chewing; whilst they
have been straining at <HI>Knats</HI> in Theology,
and hesitating at frivolous and indifferent
Things of the Church, of no Conse∣quence.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracle in this Story,
which consisted in his healing a Man, of
no body knows what <HI>Infirmity,</HI> there nei∣ther
is nor can be proved any Thing su∣pernatural
in it, or there had been an
express Description of the Disease, with∣out
which it is impossible to say, there
was a miraculous Cure wrought. As far as
one may reasonably guess, this Man's <HI>In∣firmity</HI>
was more <HI>Lazyness</HI> than <HI>Lameness,</HI>
and <HI>Jesus</HI> only shamed him out of his
pretended Illness, by bidding him to take
up his Stool and walk off, and not lie a∣ny
longer, like a lazy Lubbard and Dis∣sembler,
among the Diseased, who were
real Objects of Pity and Compassion: Or,
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
if he was no Dessembler, he was only
fancyfully sick, and <HI>Jesus</HI> by some proper
and seasonable Talk touch'd his Heart, to
his Relief; and so, by the Help of his own
Imagination, he was cured, and went his
Way. This is the <HI>worst</HI> that can be
made of this <HI>infirm</HI> Man's Case; and the
<HI>best</HI> that can be said of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Power
in the Cure of him, as will appear, by and
by, upon Examination into it. But the
other Parts of the Story of the healing
Virtue of the Waters, upon the Descent
of an Angel into them, is not only void
of all good Foundation in History, but
is a Contradiction to common Sense and
Reason, as will be manifest after an In∣quiry
into the Particulars of it.</P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI> was the beloved Disciple of
our Lord, and I hope he lov'd his Master;
or he was worse than an Heathen, who
loves those who love him: But this Story,
and some others, that are peculiar to his
Gospel, such as, of <HI>Jesus's telling the Sama∣ritan
Woman her Fortune</HI>; of <HI>his healing
the blind Man with Eye-Salve made of
Clay and Spittle</HI>; Of <HI>his turning Water
into Wine for the Use of Men, who had
before well drank</HI>; and of <HI>his raising La∣zarus
from the Dead,</HI> are enough to tempt
us to think, that he wilfully design'd, ei∣ther
to blast the Reputation of his Master,
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
or to try how far the Credulity of Men,
who through blind Love were running a∣pace
into Christianity, might be imposed
on; or he had never related such idle Tales,
which, if the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> who should be the
philosophical Part of Mankind, had not
been amply hired into the Belief of them,
would certainly have been rejected with
Indignation and Scorn before now.</P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI> wrote his Gospel many Years
after the other <HI>Evangelists</HI>: What then
should have been his peculiar Business?
Certainly nothing more, than to add some
remarkable Passages of Life, to <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Ho∣nour,
which they had omitted; and to con∣firm
the Truths which they had before re∣ported
of him. But St. <HI>John</HI> is so far from
doing this, that the Stories, he has parti∣cularly
added, are not only derogatory
to the Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> but spoil his
Fame for a Worker of Miracles, which
the other <HI>Evangelists</HI> would raise him to.
By reading the other <HI>Evangelists,</HI> one
would think, that <HI>Jesus</HI> was a Healer of
all manner of Diseases, however incurable
by Art and Nature, and that where-ever
he came, all the sick and the maim'd
(excepting a few Infidels) were perfectly
cured by him. But this Story before us
will be like a Demonstration, that <HI>Jesus</HI>
was no such Worker of Miracles and
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
Healer of Diseases, as he is commonly
believed to have been, and that he wrought
not near the Number of Cures, he is sup∣posed
to have done, much less any great ones.
The best Conception that an impartial Rea∣der
of the Gospel can form of <HI>Jesus,</HI> is, that
he was a tolerable good natural <HI>Orator,</HI> and
could handsomely harangue the People
off hand, and was according to the Phi∣losophy
of the Times a good <HI>Cabalist</HI>;
and his Admirers finding him endewed
with the Gift of Utterance, which was
thought by them more than human, they
fancy'd he must have the Gift of healing
too, and would have him to exercise it;
which he did with Success, upon the Fan∣cies
and Imaginations of many, who mag∣nified
his divine Power for it. And the
Apostles afterwards, to help forward the
Credulity and Delusion of the People,
amplified his Fame with extravagant As∣sertions
and strange Stories of Miracles,
passing the Belief of considerate and wise
Men. Whether this Representation of the
Case, according to the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Gos∣pels,
be false and improbable, let my
<HI>Readers</HI> judge by the Story before us,
which I come now to dissect, and make
a particular Examination into the several
Parts of it. Accordingly it is to be ob∣serv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45"/>
<HI>First,</HI> that this Story of the <HI>Pool</HI> of
<HI>Bethesda,</HI> abstractedly considered from
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Cure of an infirm Man at it, has
no good Foundation in History: It merits
no Man's Credit, nor will any reasonable
Person give any heed to it. St. <HI>John</HI> is
the only Author that has made any
mention of this Story; and tho' his Au∣thority
may be good, and better than an∣other
Man's in Relation to the Words
and Actions of <HI>Jesus,</HI> in as much as he
was most familiar and conversant with
him; yet, for foreign Matters, that have
no immediate Respect to <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Life, he's
no more to be regarded than another <HI>Histo∣rian,</HI>
who, if he palm upon his <HI>Readers</HI>
an improbable Tale of sensless and absurd
Circumstances, will have his Authority
questioned, and his Story pry'd into by
the Rules of <HI>Criticism,</HI> and rejected or
received as it is found worthy of Be∣lief
and Credit. If there had been any
Truth in this Story before us, I cannot
think but <HI>Josephus</HI> or some other <HI>Jewish</HI>
Writers, it is so remarkable, peculiar and
astonishing an Instance of the Angelical
Care and Love to the distressed of <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI>
would have spoken of it: But I don't
find they have; or our modern <HI>Commen∣tators</HI>
would have refer'd to them, as to
a Testimony of the Credibility of the
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
Gospel-History. <HI>Josephus</HI> has professed∣ly
written the History of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
Nation, in which he seems to omit no∣thing
that makes for the Honour of his
Country, or for the Manifestation of the
Providence of God over it. He tells us
of the Conversation of Angels with the
Patriarchs and Prophets, and intermixes
Extra-Scriptural Traditions, as he thought
them fit to be transmitted to Posterity.
How came he then and all other <HI>Jewish</HI>
Writers to forget this Story of the Pool
of <HI>Bethesda?</HI> I think, we may as well
suppose that a Writer of the natural Hi∣story
of <HI>Somersetshire</HI> would neglect to
speak of the medicinal Waters of <HI>Bath,</HI>
as <HI>Josephus</HI> should omit that Story, which,
if true, was a singular Proof of God's di∣stinguishing
Care of his peculiar People,
or an Angel had never been frequently,
as we suppose, sent to this Relief of the
Diseased amongst them. Is then St. <HI>John</HI>'s
single Authority enough to convey this
Story down to us? Some may say, that
there are several Prodigies, as well as po∣litical
Events of ancient Times, that, tho'
they are reported but by one Historian,
meet with Credit; and why may not St.
<HI>John</HI>'s Testimony be equal to another
Writer's? I grant it; and tho' it is hardly
probable but that this Story, if true, before
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
us, must have had the Fortune to be told
by others; yet St. <HI>John</HI>'s single Authori∣ty
shall pass sooner than another Man's,
if the Matter be in itself credible and well
circumstanc'd. But were it is blindly Im∣perfectly
and with monstrously incredible
Circumstances related, like this before us,
it ought to be rejected. Which brings me,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To ask, what was the true
Occasion of the Angels Descent into this
Pool? Was it to wash and bath himself?
Or, was it to impart an healing Quality
to the Waters for some one diseased Per∣son?
The Reason, that I ask the first of
these two Questions, is, because some
ancient Readings of v. 4. say <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Vid, Milli. Nov. Test. <HI>In Loc.</HI></NOTE> the
Angel <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>was washed,</HI> which supposes
some bodily Defilement or Heat contract∣ed
in the Caelestial Regions, that want∣ed
Refrigeration or Purgation in these
Waters: But how absurd such a Thought
is, needs no Proof. To impart then com∣passionately
an healing Power to the Wa∣ters
for the Benefit of the Diseased was
the sole Design of the Angel's Descent in∣to
them. And God forbid, that any should
philosophically debate the Matter, and
enquire how naturally the Waters deriv'd
that Virtue from the Angel's corporal
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
Presence. The Thing was providential
and miraculous, our <HI>Divines</HI> will say, and
so let it pass. But I may fairly ask, why
one diseased Person only at a Time reap'd
the Benefit? Or why the whole Num∣ber
of impotent Folks were not at once
healed? I have a notable Answer pre∣sently
to be given to these Questions; but
I am afraid beforehand, our <HI>Divines</HI> will
not approve of it: Therefore they are to give
one of their own, and make the Matter
consistent with the Goodness and Wisdom
of God; or the said Questions spoil the
Credit of the Story, and make an idle
and ridiculous Romance of it. And when
their Hands are in, to make, what is im∣possible,
a satisfactory Answer to the
said Questions; I wish, that, for the sake
of <HI>Orthodoxy,</HI> they would determine, whe∣ther
the Angel descended with his Head
or his Heels foremost, or whether he might
not come swauping upon his Breast into
the Waters, like a Goose into a Horse∣pond.
But,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> How often in the Week, the
Month or the Year did the Angel
vouchsafe his Descent into the Pool?
And for how many Ages before <HI>Christ</HI>'s
Advent, and why not since and even <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Quare modo non movetur Aqua? St. <HI>Am∣bros. de Sacrament. Lib. C.</HI> 2.</NOTE> 
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
<HI>now,</HI> was this Gracious and Angelical Fa∣vour
granted? St. <HI>John</HI> should have been
particular as to these Points, which he could
not but know Philosophers would be cu∣rious
to enquire about. If it was but once
in the Year, as St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>In Serm. contra Eberictatem.</HI></NOTE> hints,
little Thanks are due to him for his Cour∣tesy.
One would think sometimes, that
his Descent was frequent; or such a Mul∣titude
of impotent Folk, variously dis∣order'd
had never attended on it. And
again at other Times, one would think
that his Descent was seldom, or the Dis∣eased
as fast as they came, which could
not be faster than the Angel could dabble
himself in the Waters, had been charita∣bly
dismissed with restor'd Health. Here
then is a Defect in St. <HI>John</HI>'s Story, and a
<HI>Block,</HI> at which wise and considerate Free-Thinkers
will stumble. But,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> How came it to pass, that
there was not better Care taken, either
by the Providence of God, or of the
Civil Magistrates of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> about
the Disposal of the Angelical Favour to
this or that poor Man, according to his
Necessities or Deserts: But that he, who
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
could fortunately catch the Favour, was
to have it. Just as he who runs fastest
obtains the Prize: So here the Diseased,
who was most nimble and watchful of
the Angel's Descent, and could first plunge
himself into the Pool, carried off the Gift
of Sanation. An odd and a merry Way of
conferring a divine Mercy. And one would
think that the Angels of God did this
for their own Diversion, more than to
do good to Mankind, Just as some
throw a Bone among a Kennel of Hounds,
for the Pleasure of seeing them quarrel
for it; or as others cast a Piece of Mo∣ney
among a Company of Boys for the
Sport of seeing them scramble for it: So
was the Pastime of the Angels here. It
was the Opinion of some Heathens, that
<HI>Homines sunt Lusus Deorum,</HI> the Gods
sport themselves with the Miseries of
Mankind; but I never thought, before
I considered this Story, that the <HI>An∣gels</HI>
of the God of the <HI>Jews</HI> did so too.
But if they delighted in it, rare sport
it was to them, as could be to a <HI>Town-Mobb.</HI>
For as the poor and distressed
Wretches were not to be supposed to
be of such a polite Conversation, as in
Complaisance to give place to their bet∣ters,
or in Compassion to make way
for the most miserable; but upon the Sight
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
or Sound of the Angel's Fall into the Pool,
would without Respect of Persons strive who
should be first: So those who were behind
and unlikely to be cured, would like an
unciviliz'd <HI>Rabble,</HI> push and press all
before them into it. What a Number
then, of some hundreds perhaps, of poor
Creatures were at once tumbled into the
Waters to the Diversion of the City Mob,
as well as of God's Angels? And if one
arose out of it, with the Cure of his Dis∣ease,
the rest came forth like drown'd <HI>Rats,</HI>
to the Laughter of the foresaid Specta∣tors;
and it was well if there was not some∣times
more Mischief done, than the heal∣ing
of <HI>one</HI> could be of Advantage, to those
People. Believe then this Part of the Story,
let him that can. If any Angel was con∣cern'd
in this Work, it was an Angel of
<HI>Satan</HI> who delights in Mischief; and if
he healed <HI>one</HI> upon such an Occasion, he
did it by way of Bait, to draw others
into Danger of Life and Limb. But as
our <HI>Divines</HI> will not, I suppose, bear the
Thoughts of it's being a bad Angel; so
I leave them to consider upon our Rea∣sonings,
whether it was credible that ei∣ther
a good or a bad Angel was concern∣ed,
and desire them to remember to give
me a better Reason, why but <HI>one</HI> at a
Time was healed.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="52"/>
If any Pool or Cistern of Water about
this City of <HI>London</HI> was so blessed with the
Descent of an Angel to such an End, the
Magistrates, such is their Wisdom, would, if
God did not direct, take care of the pru∣dent
Disposal of the Mercy to the best
Advantage of the Diseased. And if they
sold it to an infirm <HI>Lord</HI> or <HI>Merchant,</HI> who
could give for it most Money, to be distri∣buted
among other Poor and distress'd Peo∣ple,
would it not be wisely done of them?
To suppose they would leave the Ange∣lick
Favour to the Struggle of a Multitude,
is absurd and incredible. And why then
should we think otherwise of the Magi∣strates
of <HI>Jerusalem</HI>? Away then with
the Letter of this Story! And if this be
not enough to confute it. Then,</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Let us consider, to its farther
Confutation, who and what were the
impotent Folk, that lay in the Porches of
<HI>Bethesda,</HI> waiting the Troubling of the
Waters. St. <HI>John</HI> says they were <HI>Blind,</HI>
<HI>Halt, Withered,</HI> and as some Manuscripts
 <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">Vid. Milli. Nov. Test. <HI>In Loc.</HI></NOTE> have it, <HI>Paralyticks.</HI> And what did
any of these there? How could any of
them be supposed to be nimble enough of
Foot to step down first into the Waters,
and carry off the Prize of Sanation, be∣fore
<PB N="46" REF="53" MS="y"/>
many others of various Distempers?
Tho' the troubled Waters might be of
such medicinal Force as to heal a Man of
whatsoever Disease he had; yet none of
the foresaid Persons for want of good Feet
and Eyes could expect the Benefit of it.
Tho' the Ears of the Blind might serve
him to hear, when the Angel plump't
like a Stone into the Waters, yet through
want of Sight for the guidance of his
Steps, he would by others be jostled out
of the right Way down into them. And
if the Lame had good Eyes to discern the
the Descent of the Angel, yet Feet were
all in all to this Purpose: Consequently
these impotent Folk, specified by St. <HI>John,</HI>
might as well have slay'd at Home, as re∣sorted
to <HI>Bethesda</HI> for Cure. I know not
what Fools the Diseased of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> of
old might be, but if there was such a Prize
of Health to be strove for, by the Distem∣pered
of this City, I appeal to all Men
of common Sense, whether the <HI>Blind,</HI> the
<HI>Lame,</HI> the <HI>withered</HI> and <HI>Paralyticks</HI> would
offer to put in for it. St. <HI>John</HI> then for∣got
himself, or else blundered egregiously,
or put the Banter upon us, to try how
far an absurd Tale would pass upon the
World with Credit. There might be, if
there was any litteral Sense in the Story,
many of other Distempers, but there could
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
be neither <HI>blind, halt</HI> nor <HI>withered,</HI> with∣out
<HI>such an Absurdity,</HI> as absolutely dis∣parages
the Story, blasts the Credit of
the <HI>Relator,</HI> or rather brings to mind the
Assertion of St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> that the Letter
of the <HI>New</HI> as well as the <HI>Old Testament</HI>
lies abominably. If what I have here
said does not overthrow the Letter of this
Story; Then what I have,</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> To add, will do it more effect∣tually,
and that is, of the <HI>certain Man, that
had an Infirmity thirty and eight Years,</HI> and
lay at this Pool for an Opportunity to be
cured of it. Tho' these <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>eight</HI>
Years are, in our <HI>English</HI> Translation prae∣dicated
of this Man's Infirmity, yet more
truely, according to the Original, are they
spoken of the Time he lay there; and the
Fathers so understood St. <HI>John</HI>'s Words.
What this Man's Infirmity was, we are
uncertain: For <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Weakness</HI> or <HI>Infirmity</HI>
is a general Name of all Distermpers, and
may be equally apply'd to one as well as to
another: Whereupon, tho' we can't certain∣ly
say from this Man's Infirmity, that he
was a Fool to lay there so long, expecting
that Cure, which it was impossible for
him to obtain; yet what he says to our
Saviour, <HI>I have no Man, when the Waters
are troubled to put me into the Pool, but
while I am coming, another steppeth down</HI><PB N="48" REF="55" MS="y"/>
<HI>before me,</HI> does imply his Folly sufficient∣ly,
or rather the Incredibility of the whole
Story. What then did this <HI>infirm</HI> Man at
this Pool, if he had neither Legs of his
own good enough, nor a Friend to assist
him, in the Attainment of Sanarion? Was
he not a Fool, if it was possible for any
to be so great a one, for his Patience?
Would it not have been as wisely done
of him to wait, in the Fields so long, the
Falling of the Sky, that he might catch
Larks? The Fathers say, this Man's <HI>In∣firmity</HI>
was the <HI>Palsy</HI>; but whether they
said so for the Sake of the Mystery, or
to expose the Letter, I know not. But that
Distemper after <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>eight</HI> Years
Duration, and Increase, if it was more
curable than another at first, had in that
time undoubtedly so weakened and render'd
him uncapable to struggle with others
for this Relief, that it is without Sense and
Reason to think he should wait so long for
it. Our <HI>Divines,</HI> if they so please, may
commend this Man for his Patience, but
after a few Years, or rather a few Days
Experience, another Man would have
been convinc'd of the Folly and Vanity
of his Hopes, and returned Home. If
he could not put in for this Benefit, with
Prospect of Success in his more youthful
Days, when the Distemper was young too,
<PB N="49" REF="56" MS="y"/>
much less Reason had he to hope for it
in his old Age, after <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>eight Years</HI>
Affliction, unless he dream'd of, what was
not to be imagined, an Opportunity, with∣out
Molestation and Competition, to go
off with it. Whatever then our <HI>Divines</HI>
may think of this Man and his Patience,
I will not believe there ever was such a
Fool; and for this Reason will not sup∣pose
St. <HI>John</HI> could litterally so ro∣mance,
unless he meant to bambouzle
Mankind into the Belief of the greatest
Absurdity. A Man that Lies with a Grace
to deceive others, makes his Story so
hang together, as to carry the Face and
Appearance of Truth along with it;
which this of St. <HI>John,</HI> that for many
Ages has been swallowed, for the Reason
before us, has not. But what is the worst
of all against this Story is,</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly</HI> That which follows, and
absolutely destroys the Fame and Credit
of <HI>Jesus</HI> for a Worker of Miracles. <HI>And</HI>
V. 1, 2, 3, <HI>Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
where there was by the Sheep-Market, a
Pool, called Bethesda, having five Porches,
in which lay a great Multitude of impo∣tent
Folk, blind, halt, withered.</HI> Why then
did not <HI>Jesus</HI> heal them? Here was a
rare Opportunity for the Display of his
Healing and Almighty Power; and why
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
did he not exercise it, to the Relief of
that Multitude of impotent Folk? If
he could not cure them, there's an End
of his Power of Miracles; and if he
would not, it was want of Mercy and
Compassion in him. Which way soever
we take this Case, it turns to the Disho∣nour
of the Holy <HI>Jesus.</HI> What then was
the Reason, that of so great a Multitude
of diseased People, <HI>Jesus</HI> exerted his
Power, and extended his Mercy, on only
<HI>one</HI> poor Paralytick? St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">Tot jacebant et unus curatus, cum posset uno Verbo omnes erigere. Quid ergo intelligendum est, nisi quia Potestas et Bonitas illa magis agebat, <HI>&amp;c. In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> 
puts this Question and Objection into
my Mouth; and tho' neither He nor I
start it for the Service of Infidelity, but
to make Way for the Mystery; yet I
know not why <HI>Infidels,</HI> may not make Use
of it, till Ministers of the Letter can give
a satisfactory Answer and Solution to it.</P>
<P>The Evangelists, <HI>Matthew, Mark,</HI> and
<HI>Luke,</HI> tell such Stories of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s healing
Power, as would incline us to think he
cured all where-ever he came. He <HI>heal'd,</HI>
they say, <HI>all Manner</HI> of Diseases among
the People, and they make mention of
particular Times and Places, where all
the Diseased were healed by him, which
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
Assertions imply, that <HI>Jesus</HI>'s healing Pow∣er
was most extensive and (excepting to
an hard-hearted and unbelieving <HI>Pharisee</HI>
now and then) universal; so far that it
might be question'd, whether any died,
during the Time of his Ministry, in
the Places where he came: And our
<HI>Divines</HI> have so harangued on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Mi∣racles,
as would confirm us in such an
Opinion: But this Story in St. <HI>John</HI>
confutes and confounds all. St. <HI>John</HI> in
no Place of his Gospel talks of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
healing of many, nor of all manner of
Diseases, much less of all that were Dis∣eased;
which, if it be not like a Contra∣diction
to the other <HI>Evangelists,</HI> is some Di∣minution
of their Authority, and enough to
make us suspect, that they stretch'd much
in praise of their Master, and said more
to his Honour than was strictly true. But
this Place before us is a flat Contradicti∣on
to them, and <HI>Jesus</HI> is not to be sup∣posed
to heal many in any Place, much
less all manner of Diseases, or he had never
let such a Multitude of poor Wretches
pass without the Exercise of his Pow∣er
and Pity on them. Some good Rea∣son
then must be given for <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Con∣duct
here, and such a one as will adjust
it to the Reports of the other Evange∣lists;
or <HI>Infidels</HI> will think, that either

they romanc'd for the Honour of their
Master, or that St. <HI>John</HI> in Spite told
this Story to the Degradation of him.
I can conceive no better of this Mat∣ter
according to the Letter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield</HI> very remark∣ably
says, <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">Defence of Christianity, P. 415.</NOTE> <HI>that Jesus where-ever
he went, healed all that came to home with∣out
Distinction, the important, halt, wither∣ed.</HI>
He certainly had this Text of St.
<HI>John</HI> in his Eye, when he said so, because
<HI>Impotent, Halt, Withered,</HI> are only men∣tion'd
here, where Jesus cured <HI>none</HI> of
them: Whereupon if his <HI>Lordship</HI> had
made but a marginal Reference to this
Text, it would have been the best Jest and
Banter, with a, Sneer, that ever was put
upon <HI>Jesus</HI> and his Power of Miracles:
As it is, it's a very good one, and I
desire my Readers to take Notice of
it, that his Lordship may not lose the
Credit and Praise of it. It's sor such Cir∣cumspection
of Thought, Exactness of
Expression, and Acuteness of Wit, that
I admire that <HI>Prelate,</HI> and must needs say
of him, whether he ever be translated to
<HI>Canterbury</HI> or <HI>York,</HI> or not, that he's an
<HI>arch</HI> Bishop.
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
But to return and go on. The Con∣duct
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> to all Appearance, is not
only blameable, his Power of healing dis∣putable,
and his Mercy indefensible, for
that he cured but <HI>one</HI> infirm Man out of
a Multitude, at <HI>Bethesda,</HI> but,</P>
<P><HI>Eightly,</HI> and lastly, it may reasonably be
questioned, whether he wrought any Mi∣racle
in the healing of this <HI>one</HI> Man.
Miracles (to say nothing of the ridicu∣lous
Distinction between divine and dia∣bolical
ones) are Works done out of the
Course of Nature, and beyond the Imi∣tation
of human Art of Power. Now
whether the Cure of this infirm Man can
be brought under this Definition of a Mi∣racle,
may be doubted. What this Man's
<HI>Infirmity,</HI> which is a general Name for
all Distempers, was, we know not. How
then can we say he was miraculously
cured, unless, we knew his Disease to be
incurable by Art, which none can affirm?
The worst that we know of this Man's
Case, is, that it was of a long Conti∣nuance,
no less than of <HI>eight</HI> and <HI>thirty</HI>
Years: And the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield</HI> and
others in their florid Harangues of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Works, make the Cure of such Chroni∣cal
Diseases to be miraculous: But why
so? Many Instances may be given of In∣firmities
of human Nature, of a long Du∣ration,
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
which in Time, and especially in old
Age, wear off. If such Infirmites don't
occur to the Memory of our <HI>Divines,</HI> I
could put them in Mind of them. And
who knows but this was the Case of
this impotent Man, whose Infirmity <HI>Jesus</HI>
observing to be wearing off, bid him to
be gone, and take up his Couch, for he
would soon be made whole.</P>
<P>The Fathers indeed call this Man's
Infirmity the <HI>Palsy,</HI> which in truth is ge∣nerally
worse than better by Time, and
after <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>eight</HI> Years, must needs
be very deplorable, and incurable with∣out
a Miracle. But why do they call
it the Palsy? They have no Authority for
it from the Text, without which, as our
litteral <HI>Doctors</HI> will not subscribe to their
Opinions in other Cases; so why should
I here? In short, the Fathers had never
call'd it the <HI>Palsy,</HI> but for the sake of the
Mystery; and I am not bound to own
<HI>that</HI> to have been the Distemper, any
more than it was want of Legs; for that
would be making of Miracles for <HI>Jesus,</HI>
without Reason and Authority.</P>
<P>If <HI>Jesus</HI> here had healed the whole
<HI>Multitude of impotent Folk</HI>; without En∣quiry
what Numbers there might be of
them, I should have believed that he
wrought there many great Miracles, in as
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
much as in such a great Multitude, there
must needs, in all Probability, be some
incurable by Art or Nature: But since he
cured only this <HI>one</HI> Man, it affords Mat∣ter
of Speculation, whether he was the
<HI>most</HI> or the <HI>least</HI> diseased amongst them.
Our <HI>Divines,</HI> for the sake of the Miracle,
may possibly suppose him to be the most
grieviously afflicted of any; but <HI>Infidels,</HI>
on the other hand, will say, not so:
but with their Cavils will urge that this
infirm Man was either a Dissembler, whom
<HI>Jesus</HI> shamed out of his pretended Dis∣ease,
or that he was only hippish, and fan∣cyfully
more than really distemper'd of
a long Time, whom <HI>Jesus</HI> by suitable Ex∣hortations
and Admonitions, working up∣on
his Imagination, persuaded into a
Belief of his Cure, and bid him to walk
off. Certain it is, that <HI>Infidels</HI> will say,
it was not a Power of Miracles in <HI>Jesus</HI>
which heal'd him, or he had used it then
and there for the Sanation of others also.</P>
<P>And thus have I finish'd my Invective
against the Letter of this Story; which,
if any are offended at, they enjoy, what
is the most reasonable Thing in the World,
the same Liberty to write for the Letter,
which I have used against it: And so I
pass to the Consideration of the Opini∣ons
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
and Expositions of the Fathers on
this strange Story.</P>
<P>The Fathers, upon whose Authority
I form'd my preceding Invective a∣gainst
the Letter, so universally betake
themselves to the mystical Interpretation
of this Story, that it may be question'd,
whether any of them, more than myself,
believ'd any Thing at all of the Letter
of it. St. <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> who is as much a
litteral Interpreter of the Scriptures as
any of them, here intirely discards the
Letter, saying admirably thus, <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Quis hic Curationis modus? quid ho cnobis mysterium significatur? non <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> nec <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> haec, sed futura nobis, tanquam imagine et figura qua∣dam describuntur, ne res nimium incredibilis et in expectata, accedente fidei Virtute, Multitudinis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offenderet. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>what
a strange Way and Story of healing the
Diseased is here? but what is the Mystery
of it? that we are to look to. The Mat∣ter
could not be so simply and unadvisedly
transacted litterally, as it is related. There
must be somewhat future here, as by a Type
and Figure, signify'd</HI>; <HI>or the Story, it is
so incredible in itself, will give Offence to
many.</HI> St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> was certainly in
the right on't; and I wonder, for which
no Reason but want of Liberty can be
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
given, that <HI>Infidels</HI> have not before now,
with their Jests and Cavils, ridiculed this
Story. St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> to the same Purpose,
says, <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">Aqua turbata—credas hoc Angelica Vir∣tute fieri solere, non tamen sine significante aliquo Sacramento? <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Can any one believe, that these
Waters of Bethesda were wont to be
troubled in this Fashion, and that there
was not Mystery, and a spiritual Significa∣tion
in it?</HI> Yes, I could tell St. <HI>Augu∣stin,</HI>
that our modern <HI>Divines</HI> seem to
believe it, tho' he, if he was now alive,
would laugh at them for it. But to come
to the profound Mystery signified by
this Story, which to use the Words of
 <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Cujus Rei et cujus signi profundum mysteri∣um. quantum Dominus donare dignatur, loquar ut potero. <HI>Ibid</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> as God shall enable me,
I will now speak to.</P>
<P>Our <HI>English</HI> Version says, <HI>There is at
Jerusalem by the Sheep-Market, a Pool.</HI>
How our <HI>Translators</HI> came by the Notion
of a <HI>Market</HI> here, I can't imagine, since
there is nothing to favour it in the Ori∣ginal,
which stands thus, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:
By <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Fathers un∣derstand
 <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">Piscina illa Baptismum designat. <HI>Theophyl. In Loc.</HI> Quaenam igitur haec descriptio? Futurum erat Baptisma plenum maximae Potestatis et Gratiae purgaturum peccata. <HI>Chrysost. in Loc.</HI></NOTE> Baptism, or the spiritual <HI>La∣ver</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
of Regeneration; and who is that for,
but the Flock of Christ, signified by <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>?
So we have another and clearer
Interpretation of these two Words. And
as to <HI>Bethesda,</HI> that is a mystical Name
of the Church, which according to the
Signification of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> is the House
of Grace. And if it is said to be at <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI>
it is not to be understood of the
Old <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but of the <HI>New</HI> and Apo∣stolical
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> at the Entrance into
which the Flock of Christ will be baptiz'd
by the Waters of the Spirit, as in mysti∣cal
Laver.</P>
<P><HI>Bethesda</HI> is said to have five <HI>Porches,</HI>
that is, as the Fathers <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">Per quinque Porticus, quinque Libros Mo∣sis intelligo, St. <HI>Theophil. Antioch. in Loc.</HI> Quin∣que Porticus sunt quinque Libri Mosis. St. <HI>August. in Loc.</HI></NOTE> agree, the
five Books of <HI>Moses,</HI> which are as so
many Doors of Entrance into the House
of Wisdom, or of the Grace of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>At these <HI>five Porches</HI> of the five Books
of Moses lay <HI>a great Multitude of impo∣tent
Folk, blind, halt, withered.</HI> And who
are these mystically? The ignorant, er∣roneous,
and unstable in Faith and Prin∣ciple,
as the Fathers often understand them
spiritually. And what is the Reason of
these their mystical Diseases? Because, as
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">Mosis quinque Libros scripsit, sed in quinque Porticibus Piscinam cingentibus languidi jacebant, et curari non poterant. Vide quomodo manet littera, convincens eum non salvans iniquum. Illis enim quinque Porticibus, in figura quinque Li∣brorum prodebantur potius quam sinabantur aegroti. Ergo quicunque amatis litteram sine gratia, in Por∣ticibus remanebitis, aegri eritis, jacentes non con∣valescentes, de littera enim praesumitis. <HI>In Psal.</HI> lxx.</NOTE> and other Fathers say,
they rest on the Letter of the Law, which
throws them into various Errors, like
Diseases, of different Kinds, of which
they can't be cured without the Descent
of the Spirit, like an Angel, to instruct
them mystically to interpret.</P>
<P>With these impotent Folk lay <HI>a certain
Man who had an Infirmity.</HI> And who is
this infirm Man? Mankind in general,
say St. <HI>Cyril</HI> <NOTE N="52" PLACE="foot">Est Figura Populi in ultimis temporibus sanandi. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> and <NOTE N="53" PLACE="foot">Languidus ille, de quo in Evangelio legi∣mus, quia jacebat, Typum Generis humani habere videbatar. <HI>In Serm.</HI> cclxxiv, <HI>Append.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Augustin.</HI>
And what is his Infirmity? The Fathers
call it the <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">Paralyticum qui juxta Natatoriam jacebat. <HI>Irenaei. Lib.</HI> ii. Cap. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Palsy,</HI> because of his In∣stability,
and Unsteadiness in Faith and
Principles, which is now the Case of
of Mankind. St. <HI>John</HI> calls it <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<HI>a Weakness,</HI> which being a general Name
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
of all Distempers, we can't guess what
might be here the specifical one. But rea∣sonably
speaking, according to the Rule
of Interpretation, this Man's <HI>Infirmity</HI>
is the same with the Woman's <HI>Spirit of In∣firmity,</HI>
and that is a Weakness at the
Spirit of Prophecy, which Mankind, as
well as the Woman of the Church, is to
be cured of in the Perfection of Time.</P>
<P>And how long did this Man with his
Infirmity lay in these Porches of <HI>Bethesda?
Thirty eight Years:</HI> So has Mankind with
his Weakness at the Spirit of Prophecy
lay eight and thirty (hundred) <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot">Tempus et Annus sunt centum Anni. <HI>Tichonii in Reg.</HI> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Years,
reckoning two thousand under the Law,
and eighteen hundred since under the
Gospel. St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Quod autem triginta et octo Annos in Lan∣guoribus positus erat, do illo Quadraginta nume∣ro, quem supra diximus duo minus habens; et quae sunt ista duo. nisi duo praecepta, dilectio Dei et Proximi. Ista duo, in quibus tota Lex pendet et Prophetae, si non habuerit, languidus et Para∣lyticus jacet. <HI>In Ps.</HI> lxxxiii.</NOTE> has an ingeni∣ous
and more mystical way of Compu∣tation
of these <HI>thirty and eight Years,</HI>
which pleases me too, but possibly some
Readers may not so easily apprehend it,
unless they are well acquainted with the
Mystery of Prophetical Numbers.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="68"/>
And how is Mankind to be cured of
his Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy?
By being instructed, by the Spirit of
Truth, who is to come at the Conclusion
of the said thirty and eight mystical Years,
<HI>to arise and take up his bed and walk,</HI> that
is, to raise his Thoughts to the Contem∣plation
of the divine Mysteries of the Law,
and to lift up his Bed of the Letter, on
which he has hitherto <HI>rested,</HI> into a sub∣lime
Sense, and then he will walk up∣rightly
and steadily in the Faith, with∣out
wavering like a Paralytick.</P>
<P>And at what Season did <HI>Jesus</HI> come to
this infirm Man? It was at a Feast of the
<HI>Jews. Irenaeus, Chrysostom, Theophylact,</HI> and
<HI>Cyril</HI> call it the Feast of Penticost. And
the grand Feast of Penticost is, as St.
<HI>Cyril</HI> <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">Quod autem sub finem Hebdomadum Sanctae Pentecostes ipse revertitur Hierosolymam, figuratè et aenigmatice significat futurum nostri Sal∣vatoris Reversionem ultimis praesentis aevi tempo∣ribus. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> says upon the Place, at the
Perfection of Time, the Time of the E∣vangelical
Sabbath, and of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s spiritual
Advent, which will be a Time of feasting
on intellectual and divine Mysteries, of see∣ing
Visions and of dreaming Dreams; con∣sequently
at that Time, as the ancient <HI>Jews</HI>
and Fathers assert, Mankind will be cured of
this Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69"/>
And this too is the <HI>certain Season, that
the Angel will descend and trouble the
Waters.</HI> By Angel is here meant <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">Turbabat Angelus,—dictus est Domi∣nus magni consilii Angelus. <HI>Augustin in Serm.</HI> cxxv <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE> 
the Spirit of Christ. And by Wa∣ters
the Fathers understand, <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Turbavit Aquam, id est, turbavit Popu∣lum. <HI>Ejusdem in Ps.</HI> cii.</NOTE> the Peo∣ple
of all Nations. But how will the De∣scent
of the Spirit of Truth, like an An∣gel,
trouble these Waters, that is, give
any Molestations and Disturbance to
the People? Is there not a Mistake in
the Oracle? If the <HI>Clergy</HI> will be but
greater Lovers of Truth than of their In∣terests;
if they, who should be Teachers
of Forbearance of one another in Love,
will but keep their Temper, there would
be found a mistake in it. But alas!</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> The <HI>Jews,</HI> as is intimated,
seem to have been mov'd with Indignati∣on
at the Cure of the infirm Man, say∣ing
to him, v. 10. <HI>it is the Sabbath,
it is not lawful for thee to carry thy
Bed</HI>; which litterally could not be true.
The <HI>Jews</HI> were not such precise Obser∣vers
of the Sabbath; nor <HI>so stupid and
foolish,</HI> as St. <HI>Cyril,</HI> <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">Sabbatum est et Grabatum non licet tol∣lere. Quid stupidius aut inertius esse potest <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> says, as to
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
think the taking up and carrying a Stool
to be a Breach of it. But mystically, it
is to be fear'd, this will be most true,
and that the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who would be <HI>Jews</HI>
inwardly, and the Circumcision in Spi∣rit,
will be bitter Enemies to Man's
Exaltation of his Couch of the Letter of
the Scriptures on or against the Evangeli∣cal
Sabbath, and will make it, if possible,
an <HI>unlawful</HI> Work; because it will bring
to them Shame, Dishonour and Loss of
Interests along with it.</P>
<P>After this Manner is every other Cir∣cumstance
of this Story to be allegori∣cally
apply'd out of the Fathers. The
Moral or Mystery of the whole, in short,
is this, that at the Perfection of Time,
signified by the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the <HI>Pentecost,</HI>
the End of <HI>thirty eight Years,</HI> the Spirit
of Truth will descend on Mankind, to
their Illumination in Prophecy, and to the
healing of their <HI>Errors,</HI> call'd <HI>Diseases</HI>;
which is admirably represented by the
Parable before us, that according to the
Letter has neither Reason nor common
Sense in it.</P>
<P>And thus have I spoken to <HI>eight</HI> of the
Miracles of <HI>Jesus</HI>; and whether I have
not shew'd them, in whole or Part, ac∣cording
to the Proposition before us, to
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
consist of Absurdities, Improbabilities,
and Incredibilities; and whether they are
not prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what will be mysteriously, and more
wonderfully done by <HI>Jesus,</HI> I appeal to
my <HI>Readers.</HI></P>
<P>After another Discourse of some other
Miracles, I intend to take into Examinati∣on
the several Stories of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s raising of the
Dead as of <HI>Lazarus, Jairus</HI>'s Daughter,
and the Widow's Son of <HI>Naim</HI>; which
reputedly are <HI>Jesus</HI>'s grand Miracles;
but for all the seeming Greatness and Ex∣cellency
of them, I don't doubt but to
give the Letter of these Stories a Toss out
of the Creed of a considerate and wise Man;
at least show their Insufficiency for the Pur∣pose
for which they have been hitherto
apply'd. And if I should afterwards, by
the Leave and Patience of the <HI>Bishop</HI> of
<HI>London,</HI> give my Objection against <HI>Christ</HI>'s
Resurrection a Review, and some more
Force, then what will become of the
Argument of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Power, Authority,
and <HI>Messiahship</HI> from his Miracles?</P>
<P>But, besides <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles, I am, as
Opportunity serves, to take into Consi∣deration
some of the Historical Parts of
his Life; and shew them to be no less sense∣less,
absurd and ridiculous than his Mi∣racles.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="72"/>
And why may I not sometimes treat
on the Parables of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and show what
nonsensical and absurd Things they are,
according to the Expositions of our most
famous Commentators of these last Ages.
<HI>Jesus</HI> was certainly the absolute, and most
consummate Perfection of a <HI>Cabalist,</HI>
<HI>Mystist,</HI> a <HI>Parabolist</HI> and <HI>Enigmatist</HI>; but
according to modern Commentaries and
Paraphrases, he was the merest Ideot and
Blockhead that ever open'd his Mouth,
in that sort of Learning, to the Instructi∣on
of Mankind. And I am oblig'd a
little to speak to the Absurdities of <HI>Christ</HI>'s
Doctrine and Parables, because one Article
of the Prosecution against me was for say∣ing,
<HI>that any of the Philosophers of the Gen∣tiles,</HI>
or <HI>any rational Man</HI> (meaning accord∣ing
to modern Expositions) <HI>would make a
better Teacher, than Jesus was.</HI></P>
<P>What a great deal of Work have I up∣on
my Hands, which, if God spare my
Life and Health, I intend to go on with:
If what I have already done in it be not
acceptable to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> their Way to pre∣vent
the Prosecution of this great Un∣dertaking,
is to battle me upon what's
past. Who knows but they may write, if
they would try their Strength, so acutely
in Defence of the Letter of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Mi∣racles
already discuss'd, as may effectually
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
stop my Mouth, and prevent my giv∣ing
them any more Trouble of this Kind?
And I suppose I have now gotten an
Adversary in the <HI>Bishop</HI> of St. <HI>David</HI>'s,
Who has already discharg'd one Fool's Bolt
at me.</P>
<P>There has nothing been a more com∣mon
Subject of Declamation among the
the <HI>Clergy</HI> than the <HI>Reasonableness</HI> of Chri∣stianity,
which must be understood of
the History of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Life and Doctrine,
or the Application of the Word <HI>Reasona∣bleness</HI>
to the Christian Religion is im∣pertinent.
But if I proceed, as I have
begun in this Work, I shall shew Chistiani∣ty,
as it is understood, to be the most
unreasonable and absurd Story, that ever
was told; and our modern Systems of
Theology groundless and sensless in al∣most
every Part of them. <HI>Mahometanism,</HI>
without Offence be it spoken, is a more
<HI>reasonable</HI> Religion than the Christian, up∣on
modern <HI>Schemes</HI> and <HI>Systems.</HI></P>
<P>If what I here say is offensive to our
<HI>Divines,</HI> the <HI>Press</HI> is open for them as well
as for myself, and they may, if they can,
shew their Resentment of it. Thanks un∣to
God and our most excellent Civil Go∣vernment
for such a Liberty of the <HI>Press</HI>:
A Liberty that will lead and conduct us
to the Fountain of Wisdom and Philoso∣phy,
which Restraint is a down-right Enemy
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
to. And that this Blessing of Liber∣ty
may be continued, for all <HI>Bishop Smal∣brook</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Rogers's Hobbism,</HI> is, I dare
say, the Desire of the curious, inquisitive,
and philosophical Part of Mankind. If
this Liberty should be taken away, what
a notable Figure will our <HI>Divines</HI> make
from the <HI>Press</HI> and <HI>Pulpit,</HI> declaming
on the Reasonableness, Excellency and Per∣fection
of the Christian Religion, without
an Adversary; and telling their Congre∣gations,
that all, their bitterest and acutest
Enemies can object, is clearly answered!</P>
<P>The <HI>Press,</HI> of late Years, has been pro∣ductive
of so many cogent and persuasive
Arguments for Liberty of debate, and the
Advocates for this Liberty, in the Judg∣ment
of the impartial and considerate,
have so far gotten the better of their
Adversaries, that I wonder any one can
appear in behalf of Persecution. If I was
a <HI>Bishop</HI> or <HI>Doctor</HI> in <HI>Divinity,</HI> I shoud
think it a Disgrace to my Station and E∣ducation
to ask the Assistance of the Ci∣vil
Authority to protect my Religion: I
should judge my self unworthy of the
Wages and Emoluments I enjoy'd, for the
Preaching and Propagation of the Gospel,
if I was unable to give an Answer to a∣ny
one, that ask'd a Reason of my Faith:
Or if I was so Shallow-pated, as to
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
think Heresie and Infidelity punishable by
the Civil Magistrate, I should think my∣self
as much oblig'd to confute by
<HI>Reason,</HI> as he is to punish by the <HI>Sword.</HI>
If the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> had taken this
Course with me; if he had publish'd a
Refutation of my supposed Errors, as
well as endeavour'd at a Prosecution
of me for them, I had forgiven him the
Wrongs and Injuries done me, and made
no repeated Demands of Satisfaction for
them.</P>
<P>Christianity is, as I believe, founded
on a Rock of Wisdom; and what's more,
has an omnipotent and omniscient God
on its Side, who can incline the Hearts
of Men to believe, and open the Eyes of
their Understanding to discern the Truth
of it; consequently there can be no Dan∣ger
in the Attempts of our Adversaries,
whether <HI>Jews, Turks</HI> or Domestick <HI>In∣fidels,</HI>
against it. But Persecution implys
Weakness and Impotency in God to defend
his own Cause; or his Priests would not
move for the Help of the Arm of Flesh in
Vindication of it. And if, at this Time
of Day, after so many Treatises of <HI>lnfi∣dels,</HI>
and some of them as yet unanswered,
against our Religion, this good Cause
should be taken out of the Hands of
God, and committed to the Care of the
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
Civil Magistrate; if instead of Reason,
the Clergy should have Recourse to Force,
what will By-standers, and even Well∣wishers
to Christianity say? Nothing less
than that <HI>Infidels</HI> had gotten the better of
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Ministers, and beaten them at
their own Weapons of Reason and Argu∣ment.</P>
<P>The two great Pleaders for Persecu∣tion,
to the Disgrace of themselves and
Dishonour of our Religion, that have
lately arose are Dr. <HI>Rogers</HI> and the <HI>Bi∣shop</HI>
of St. <HI>David</HI>'s. Dr. <HI>Rogers</HI>'s chief
Reason against Liberty of Debate, is be∣cause,
as he says, it is pernicious to the
Peace and Welfare of the Community, by
unsettling the Minds of the People about
the Religion established: But here's no Con∣sequence, unless it could be proved, that
such as the great Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Scheme,</HI> have it in their Hearts to raise
Mobbs upon the Government, and to beat
out the Brains of the <HI>Clergy.</HI> All the
Harm, or rather Good, they aim at, is to
exercise the Wits of the <HI>Clergy</HI> with their
Doubts and Objections; and if the Passi∣ons
of our <HI>Ecclesiasticks</HI> are not raised up∣on
it, to the doing of Violence to these
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the Peace of the Publick will
never de disturb'd. As to myself, tho'
I have a vast and numerous Party on
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
my Side, no less than all the Fathers and
primitive Christians for some Ages; yet
as we were peaceable and quiet Subjects
of old, and passively obedient to the <HI>Empe∣rors</HI>
of <HI>Rome</HI>; so we will continue to the
Civil Authority of this Nation. We on∣ly
take the Liberty to awaken the Cler∣gy
out of a Lethargy of Dulness and Ig∣norance;
and hope the Civil Magistrate
will consider the Goodness and Charity
of our Intentions, and guard us against
their Insults for it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bishop</HI> of St. <HI>David</HI>'s <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Sermon before the Society for Reformation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 12.</NOTE> says,
"It is absurd to assert, that the Liberties
of any Nation will allow, with Impu∣nity,
a Set of distinguish'd Infidels to
insult and treat with the greatest Con∣tempt
and Scorn the most sacred and
important Truths, that are openly pro∣fessed,
by the whole Body of the Peo∣ple,
of whatever Denomination." By
a Set of Infidels, I suppose, he means me
and the Fathers: And by <HI>treating with
Contempt and Scorn the most sacred and im∣portant
Truths,</HI> he means, our burlesquing,
bantering and ridiculing the <HI>Clergy</HI> for
their Ministry of the Letter: And for <HI>this</HI>
he would, I conceive, have incensed the
<HI>Societies</HI> for Reformation of Manners to a
Prosecution of me. And if they had not
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
been wiser, and more merciful than their
Preacher, I must have gone to Pot. But
why should the <HI>Bishop</HI> dislike this way of
Writing? Don't he know, that the Fathers
of the Church used to jest and scoff at the
<HI>Gentiles</HI> and their Priests for their foolish
Superstitions? Don't he know, that our
<HI>Reformers</HI> banter'd and ridicul'd Pope∣ry
out of Doors, and almost within the
Memory of Man, it was reckon'd but
a dull Sermon, that was not well
humm'd for its Puns and Jests on the
Papists? why then should the <HI>Bistop</HI> be a∣gainst
that way of writing, which was of
good Use to the <HI>Reformers,</HI> and first <HI>Chri∣stians</HI>?
The grand Subject for <HI>Burlesque</HI>
and <HI>Banter,</HI> in my Opinion, is <HI>Infidelity</HI>;
and that <HI>Bishop,</HI> who can't break two Jests
upon <HI>Infidels</HI> for their one upon Christi∣anity,
has but a small Share of Wit. The
Christian Religion according to the <HI>Bishop,</HI>
will abide the Test of calm and sedate Rea∣soning
against it, but can't bear a Jest; O
strange!</P>
<P>But to leave these two Contenders for
Persecution to the Chastisement of acuter
Pens. What I have here pleaded for Li∣berty
is not through any Fears of Danger
to myself, but for the Love of Truth and
Advancement of Christianity, which, with∣out
it, can't be defended, propagated and
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
sincerely embraced. And therefore hope,
that the Controversy before us, between
<HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Apostates</HI> will be continued by
the Indulgence of the Government, till
Truth arises and shines bright to the Dissi∣pation
of the Mists of Error and Ignorance;
like the Light of the Sun to the Dispersion
of the Darkness of the Night. I will by
God's Leave, go on to bear my part in the
Controversy; And, if it was not more a∣gainst
the Interests than Reason of the
<HI>Clergy</HI> to believe me, would again solemn∣ly
declare that what I do in it is with a
View to the Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> our spiritual
<HI>Messiah,</HI> to whom be Glory for ever.
Amen.</P>
