<HI>Cowper</HI>'s Thoughts
are intent, (as they
have been, many Years) on
<PB REF="5"/>
the Good of his Countrey;
I know Your Ladyship de∣lights
in Reading; as often
as the Care of Your Family,
and the Ceremonies of Life,
allow You Leisure for an A∣musement,
too Elegant to
become Fashionable. The Two

the Accomplishments of
their Mother, are sensible of
the Advantages, arising from
<PB REF="6"/>
the early Use of Books;
which give such a Bloom to
the Mind, as the Prime of
Beauty discloses in the Fea∣tures.
Had I, therefore, been
able to make this Tragedy
(which, I humbly request,
may appear under Your Lady∣ship's
Protection) as Com∣pleat,
as it is Innocent; It
might have proved a lasting
Testimony of my sincerest Ac∣knowledgments
<PB REF="7"/>
for such Ob∣ligations,
as I can never forget,
nor disown.</P>
<P>I have had the Honour,
though I live concealed in
the utmost Privacy of Life,
long to enjoy Your Lady∣ship's
Favour. If You are
pleased to pardon this pub∣lick
Declaration of my Grati∣tude;
what has been the se∣cret
Boast of my Heart, will,

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. WILKS.</STAGE>
<L>VErtues, and Vices, are to Realms confin'd:</L>
<L>And, Climates give a Tincture to the Mind.</L>
<L>Still This, or That, Peculiar Inclination</L>
<L>Remains, Unalter'd;—and denotes a Nation.</L>
<L>Thus Rivers flow; thus Mountains, ever, stand;</L>
<L>The Marks, through every Age, of every Land.</L>
<L><HI>Britons,</HI> you'll see, when <HI>Vanoc</HI> comes before yee,</L>
<L>The Love of Freedom is your ancient Glory.</L>
<L>The <HI>Romans,</HI> first, this Native Vertue broke;</L>
<L>Made us Polite;—and bow'd us to the Yoke.</L>
<L>The <HI>Saxons,</HI> then, Unpolish'd,—greatly Rude,</L>
<L>Strangers to Luxury,—and Servitude,</L>
<L>Reviv'd the <HI>British</HI> Manliness of Soul,</L>
<L>That spurns at Tyranny, nor brookes Controul.</L>
<L>In Time, another Set of <HI>Romans</HI> came;</L>
<L>And brought worse Slavery:—Though they chang'd the
Name:</L>
<L>Tamed us with Luxuries of a different Kind;</L>
<L>And made plain Truth distasteful to the Mind.</L>
<L>By <HI>Nassaw</HI>'s Aid, at last, we drive Them, hence;</L>
<L>And, once again, return to <HI>common Sense.</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="10"/>
In <HI>Britain,</HI> ever may It keep Possession!</L>
<L>Establish'd, by the <HI>Protestant Succession.</HI></L>
<L>Blest in a Prince, whose high-traced Lineage springs</L>
<L>From the famed Race of our Old <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings;</L>
<L>Our Zeal for Liberty we, safely, own:—</L>
<L>He makes it the firm Basis of his Throne.</L>
<L>Remember, then, the Dangers, you have past:—</L>
<L>And, let your Earliest Virtue—be your Last.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. YOUNGER.</STAGE>
<L>WHAT Tragick Bustle in this <HI>British</HI> Play!—</L>
<L>But,—I am told, 'tis writ the <HI>ancient Way.</HI></L>
<L>Nay;—That it is not <HI>Modern,</HI> is plain Fact:—</L>
<L>There's not one <HI>Simile,</HI>—to close an Act.</L>
<L>But, let me see:—What other Art is wanting?—</L>
<L>In Tragedy, there ought to be some <HI>Ranting:</HI></L>
<L>Something, so Exquisite;—so very Good;—</L>
<L>It cannot, possibly, be understood!</L>
<L>But, <HI>Gwendolen's</HI> hard Fate I censure, most.—</L>
<L>The blooming Princess,—Fair,—as any Toast;</L>
<L>Captive to <HI>Valens; Yvor</HI>'s promis'd Bride;</L>
<L>Between Two, bashful Knights,—a Virgin died.</L>
<L>Three Hours, unblest,—with an <HI>Italian,</HI> pass'd!</L>
<L>No warbling Lover could have been more chaste.—</L>
<L><PB REF="12"/>
Our keener Sportsmen would have seiz'd the Quarry:—</L>
<L>But, thus it is,—when Men design—to marry.</L>
<L>Still harder Fate!—If <HI>Druid-Songs</HI> be true,</L>
<L>She must,—for ever!—Her first Flame renew.</L>
<L>Such monst'rous Constancy let <HI>Heathen</HI> Schools</L>
<L>Injoin:—We, <HI>Christian</HI> Maids, are no such Fools.</L>
<L>One Month,—at most,—we can a Husband bear:—</L>
<L>There's not <HI>Two Honey-Moons,</HI> in any Year.</L>
<L>Then; what a Brute is <HI>Vanoc!</HI>—What a Pother!—</L>
<L>How could she help it, if—she lov'd another?</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Cartismand!</HI>—There's not a Man,—now living,</L>
<L>But would have seem'd, at least, far more forgiving.</L>
<L>What?—Not connive at One?—or Two?—or Three?—</L>
<L>Well!—<HI>Britain</HI> never, till of late, was Free!</L>
<L>How would his <HI>British</HI> Blood be set a madding,</L>
<L>Had he, in <HI>Masquerades</HI> beheld her, gadding!</L>
<L>But, why does <HI>Vellocad</HI> not, once, appear?</L>
<L>He was a pretty Fellow!—you may swear!</L>
<L><HI>And, what though</HI> Vanoc <HI>says,</HI> He could not fight?</L>
<L>Is that the Way to do a Lady, Right?</L>
<L><PB REF="13"/>
Since those rude Times, <HI>Husbands</HI> are more discreet;</L>
<L>And know their <HI>Cue,</HI> to wink at—<HI>what is meet.</HI></L>
<L>Then, take us as we are.—'Tis no great Matter:—</L>
<L>For Women will be frail, while Men can flatter.</L>

<L>At <HI>Rome,</HI> indeed, the <HI>Britons</HI> are allow'd</L>
<L>To dare in War;—perhaps, even more than <HI>Romans:</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Caradoc,</HI> their captive Chief, was prais'd,</L>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh, <HI>Didius,</HI> had you prov'd their martial Rage;</L>
<L>The desperate Fury of their wild Assault!—</L>
<L>Not <HI>Scythians,</HI> not fierce <HI>Dacians,</HI> onward rush</L>
<L>With half the Speed:—Nor, half so swift retreat.</L>
<L>In Chariots, fang'd with Scythes, they scour the Field;</L>
<L>Drive through our wedged Batalions with a Whirl;</L>

<L>While this Alliance held, we stood secure.</L>

<L>Her Subjects, most, revolt:—Distress'd; pursued;</L>
<L>She begs Protection from the <HI>Roman</HI> Arms:</L>
<L>And vows perpetual Homage, for the Service.</L>
<L><HI>Ostorius</HI> interposed—No Terms of Peace</L>
<L>Would satisfy the Conquerour.—Then we,</L>
<L>To balance <HI>Vanoc</HI>'s Power, receive the Queen;</L>
