<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S soon as I had resolved to address the follow∣ing Treatise to one of the Gentlemen who was abused, together with myself, in the late infamous Libel, more than one Motive induced me to
<PB REF="3"/>
make Choice of You: For as no one was so flagrantly in∣jur'd as Yourself, the infa∣mous Aspersion was so open and so manifest, that there remained not the least Doubt who was the Person meant by it. An Insinuation equally base and groundless, which could have enter'd into the Head of no one who had either Sense, Honour, or Na∣ture in him; into the Head of no one, but one whose Mind was equally out of Na∣ture, and equally crooked and deformed with his Body. This base Insinuation was not only contrary to Truth and Justice, but even contrary to common Fame; for You are known
<PB REF="4"/>
to have that Respect, Esteem, and Affection for the most beautiful Part of the Creation, which God and Nature de∣sign'd we should have: But You have Qualities to re∣commend You to them, which have not been given to all, as Truth, Faith, Honour, Justice, and a Conversation, at the same time, entertaining, and instructing: These are Quali∣ties which have recommended You to a very fine Lady, to whom You have been married many Years, and by whom You have had Eight Chil∣dren, who are now living: And these are Qualities, which, as they have gain'd You the Affections of the Fair Sex,
<PB REF="5"/>
have equally recommended You to the Esteem and Re∣spect of Ours; and more par∣ticularly of,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was towards the latter End of the Reign of Queen ANNE that I wrote Remarks upon the first hundred Lines of the late Transla∣tion of <HI>Homer,</HI> upon the <HI>Windsor Forest,</HI> upon the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> and upon the infamous <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> provok'd and urg'd to it by the Folly, the Pride, and the Petulancy of that little Gentleman <HI>A. P-E</HI>; Qualities which at that Time made me foresee and foretell, that there was no Person what∣ever whom he apprehended to be above him, whether by Station, Power, or Merit, but he would come impudently one Day to fly in his Face, if timely Care were not taken to chastise and correct his soaring Insolence.</P>
<P>It was in the Beginning of the Reign of the late KING that I order'd three of the fore∣mention'd Treatises to be publish'd, <HI>viz. Remarks</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="7"/>
on the <HI>Translation of Homer,</HI> on <HI>Wind∣sor Forest,</HI> and on the <HI>Temple of Fame</HI>; which was done with a Design to hold a faithful Glass to this little Gentleman, and to cure him of his vain and his wretched Conceited∣ness, by giving him a View of his Ignorance, his Folly, and his natural Impotence, the un∣doubled Causes of so many Errors and so ma∣ny Imperfections.</P>
<P>But at the same Time that I order'd three of them to be publish'd, I took care to keep back the ensuing Treatise purposely <HI>in Terro∣rem</HI>; which had so good an Effect, that he endeavour'd for a time to counterfeit Humility and a sincere Repentance: And about that Time I receiv'd a Letter from him, which I have still by me, in which he acknowledg'd his Offences past, and express'd an hypocritical Sorrow for them.</P>
<P>But no sooner did he believe that Time had caus'd these Things to be forgot, than he re∣laps'd into ten times the Folly and the Mad∣ness that ever he had shewn before. He not only attack'd several Persons of far greater Me∣rit than himself, but, like a mad <HI>Indian</HI> that runs a muck, struck at every Thing that came in his Way, without Distinction of Friend or Foe, Acquaintance or Stranger, Merit or Un∣worthiness, Wisdom or Folly, Vice or Virtue; like a blind Beetle, that in its blundering Flight bruises itself against every Object it meets, and
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>
does not fail to knock itself down by the im∣potent Blows which it gives to others.</P>
<P>He has not only struck at very different Persons, without any manner of Distinction, but has thrown his rhetorical Flowers, of Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, Scoundrel, promiscuously at them all; as if he wisely thought, that he was the only foul-mouth'd Fellow in <HI>England,</HI> or had so much of the Fool, Blockhead, Dunce, Scoundrel within him, that they have the same Effect on his Mind that Jaundice would have upon his Eyes, and make every Thing without him be to him in Appearance, what in Reality is within him.</P>
<P>Nothing is more easy than to give foul Lan∣guage, which a Fool is more capable of giving to a wise Man, than a wise Man to a Fool; because nothing incapacitates a Man so much for it as good Sense, good Nature, good Breed∣ing, and common Discretion; and nothing qualifies a Man more for it, than his being a Clown, a Fool, a Barbarian, and a Brute. The calling a Man Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, Scoun∣drel, if it does not find him so, it does by no means make him so. But if it does not find him so, it gives him who calls him so, an un∣questionable Title to those Terms himself. As this is the Language of the Rabble of Mankind, the more any one brings himself to use it, the more he sets himself upon an infamous Le∣vel with the Scum and Off-scouring of Things.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="9"/>
Before I take my leave of this Subject, I cannot help reminding this little Gentlemen, <HI>en passant,</HI> that tho' his Adversaries were as many Fools, Blockheads, Dunces, as he is pleas'd, in Hononr to them, to call them; yet is he most unjust, and most ungrateful, to reflect upon any Persons for their Want of Capacity: since 'tis to People who want Understanding that he owes most of his little Fortune and all his little Reputation. For I will venture to affirm, that Mr. <HI>A. P-E</HI> has no Admirers among those who have Capacity to discern, to distinguish, and judge; and I will venture to foretell, that Time will make this Affirmation good.</P>
<P>Not but that I am oblig'd in Justice to own, that there are several Persons of very great Merit who subscrib'd to his Translation of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>; but then they were Persons most of them who were induc'd to expect a very different Performance to what they found: And some were importun'd and teaz'd into that Subscrip∣tion, some were drawn in by their Complai∣sance to their Friends, and others sacrific'd their Judgment to their Interest.</P>
<P>The calling a Man of the best Understand∣ing Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, is the easiest Thing in the World (as we observ'd above) to him who is really all this himself: But for such a one to prove what he says, is absolutely impossible. Therefore in the Remarks above∣mention'd, upon the Translation of <HI>Homer,</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="10"/>
upon <HI>Windsor-Forest,</HI> upon the <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> I have given none of these Appellations to the little facetious Gentleman at whom those Pieces were levelled; but then I have prov'd in them, by convincing Reason and by undeniable Fact, that he has a greater Right to the Possession and Property of them than any other Person in <HI>Great Britain</HI> whatever. I have shewn that he was equally a Stranger to the Character, the Language, and the Meaning of <HI>Homer</HI>; that nothing qualify'd him to en∣ter the Lists against Sir <HI>John Denham,</HI> but Im∣pudence and Stupidity; and that the <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> will, as long as 'tis remember'd, be to <HI>A. P-E</HI> the <HI>Temple of Infamy.</HI></P>
<P>I propose to do the same Thing in the sub∣sequent Remarks. I shall call him neither Fool, nor Dunce, nor Blockhead; but I shall prove that he is all these in a most egregious man∣ner. 'Tis justly observ'd by the Duke of <HI>Roch∣foucault,</HI> <Q>That a Man may be a very great Fool notwithstanding his <HI>Wit</HI>; but that he never can be so if he has <HI>Judgment</HI>: For <HI>Imagination</HI> is common to Man with Beasts, but he enjoys <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> in com∣mon with God and Angels.</Q> The impartial Reader, who knows the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> and who will read the following <HI>Remarks,</HI> will be able to determine whether <HI>A. P-E</HI> has shewn one Dram of Judgment, either in the Choice of this trifling <HI>Subject,</HI> or of his more senseless <HI>Machinery,</HI> or in the <HI>Manners</HI> and
<PB N="viii" REF="11"/>
<HI>Behaviour</HI> of his fine Lady, who is so very rampant, and so very a Termagant, that a La∣dy in the Hundreds of <HI>Drury</HI> would be se∣verely chastis'd, if she had the Impudence in some Company to imitate her in some of her Actions. The impartial Reader is to determine whether the <HI>Sentiments</HI> are not often exceeding poor, and mean, and sometimes ridiculous; and whe∣ther the <HI>Diction</HI> is not often impure and un∣grammatical.</P>
<P>But if the Author has not shewn one Dram of Judgment in the Piece that has been so much applauded by Readers more light than the Subject, what shall we say of the insipid <HI>Profund?</HI> What shall we say of the fulsome <HI>Dunciad?</HI> Were they not writ in perfect Spight to good Sense, to Decency, to Justice, to Gratitude, to Friendship, to Modesty? And can such a Creature as this be deserving of the noble Name of a POET, the Name and the Function which he has so much blasphem'd? Nay, can he deserve even the Name of a Versifyer, whose Ear is as injudicious and un∣distinguishing as the rest of his Head? The Commendation which <HI>Tasso</HI> so justly and so judiciously gives to <HI>Lucretius,</HI> is, <HI>Nobilissimo Versificatore,</HI> a <HI>most noble Versifyer:</HI> For <HI>Lu∣cretius</HI> knew all the Variety, the Force, and the Power of Numbers; so that his Harmony in some Parts of him has never been surpass'd, not even by <HI>Virgil</HI> himself. But <HI>A. P-E</HI> has none of these distinguishing Talents, nor
<PB N="ix" REF="12"/>
Variety, nor Force, nor Power of Numbers, but an eternal Monotony. His <HI>Pegasus</HI> is no∣thing but a batter'd <HI>Kentish</HI> Jade, that neither ambles, nor paces, nor trots, nor runs, but is always upon the <HI>Canterbury</HI>; and as he ne∣ver mends, never slackens his Pace, but when he stumbles or falls. So that having neither Judgment nor Numbers, he is neither Poet nor Versifyer, but only an eternal Rhimer, a little conceited incorrigible Creature, that like the Frog in the Fable, swells and is angry be∣cause he is not allow'd to be as great as the Ox.</P>
<P>But if Judgment, Reason, and Numbers are wanting to his Rhimes, if we take a View of his prosaick Rhapsodies, 'tis there a thou∣sand times worse: Not only Judgment and Reason are wanting there; but Veracity, Inte∣grity, Honour, and Faith are wanting. <HI>A. P-E</HI> sets up for a Knight of the Post, a frank Affi∣davit-Man of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> falsifies Matter of Fact at Pleasure, and invents the basest Calumnies, to expose Men of Sense to Fools. In the Height of his Professions of Friendship for Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> he could not bear the Success of <HI>Cato,</HI> but prevails upon <HI>B. L.</HI> to engage me to write and publish Remarks upon that Trage∣dy: Which after I had done, <HI>A. P-E,</HI> the better to conceal himself from Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> and his Friends, writes and publishes a scanda∣lous Pamphlet, equally foolish and villainous, in which he pretends that I was in the Hands
<PB N="x" REF="13"/>
of a Quack who cures mad Men. So weak is the Capacity of this little Gentleman, that he did not know that he had done an odious Thing; an Action detested even by those whom he fondly design'd to oblige by it. For Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> was so far from approving of it, that he engag'd Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> to write to me, and to assure me that he knew nothing of that Pamphlet till he saw it in Print, that he was very sorry to see it, and that whenever he should think fit to answer my Remarks on his Tragedy, he would do it in a manner to which I should have no just Exception. Thus Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> acted like a Man of Honour, and like one who foresaw what he himself had to expect from a Wretch who was capable of so much Baseness. What he foresaw and expected happen'd: <HI>A. P-E</HI> libell'd him in Manu∣script while he liv'd, and in Print after he died.</P>
<P>'Tis a sure Sign that we live in a poor, un∣discerning, degenerate World, when one who has writ and acted as this little Gentleman has done, has been able to delude it so long. But as he got such Favours by ungenerous Arts, he has work'd himself out of it, by his Weak∣ness and his Baseness, by which he has made, by a modest Computation, a <HI>Hundred Thou∣sand</HI> Enemies, and rais'd Indignation and Dis∣dain in the Breast of every generous and sen∣sible Reader. He has not only attack'd such Numbers of People at one Time as no one
<PB N="xi" REF="14"/>
before him ever did in any Nation or any Age, but has grosly abus'd several very inge∣nious Men; and some of them for no other Reason but because they had shewn an Under∣standing, and Discernment, and a Sagacity greatly superior to his own: Among whom I am oblig'd, in Justice, to name Mr. <HI>Theobald,</HI> who by delivering <HI>Shakespear</HI> from the Injuries of Time, and of lazy, or ignorant and stupid Editors, has oblig'd all who are concern'd for the Reputation of so great a Genius, or for the Honour of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It was for no other Reason that he has libell'd Mr. <HI>Theobald,</HI> Mr. <HI>Phillips,</HI> and several others, than that they have surpass'd him. He has been so far from making that Distinction which he ought to have done, that his Malice has been levell'd most at those who have most Merit; which is a certain Proof, that this little envious Creature knows nothing of the Nature of Sa∣tire, which can never exist where the Censures are not just. In that case the Versifyer, in∣stead of a Satirist, is a Lampooner, an infa∣mous Libeller. None of the antient Satirists, neither <HI>Horace,</HI> nor <HI>Persius,</HI> nor <HI>Juvenal,</HI> ever attack'd Merit: And <HI>Boileau</HI> declares, <Q>That Merit is always precious to him; and that he has a greater Esteem for <HI>Patru</HI> in the midst of Indigence, than for one who has amass'd the greatest Treasure by base and unjustifiable Means.</Q> He did not only say this, but shew'd, by a very generous Action, that it was his real
<PB N="xii" REF="15"/>
Sentiment. <HI>Patru</HI> had a very noble Library, consisting of a great Number of Volumes, and all of them very well chosen. He was reduc'd by his Circumstances to part with this Library, in order to satisfy his Creditors. <HI>Boileau</HI> hearing of this, came and paid down the full Price for it, and never remov'd a Volume, but gave <HI>Patru</HI> the Enjoyment of the whole during the Remainder of his Life.</P>
<P>But the little Gentleman, who wrote the <HI>Dunciad</HI> and the <HI>Profund,</HI> does not only, with infinite Baseness, reproach Authors with Pover∣ty, who have deserv'd a thousand times better both of their Country and the Commonwealth of Learning, to both which he is an open and a mortal Enemy; but he has the Impudence to infer their Want of Merit from their Want of Fortune. At this rate, <HI>Spencer,</HI> the renowned Lord <HI>Bacon, Butler,</HI> and <HI>Otway</HI> were Dunces; and <HI>A. P-E,</HI> and <HI>Ned Howard,</HI> and two or three rich and noble Lords, are Poets and great Wits. At this rate <HI>Horace</HI> too was a Dunce, because he was not only poor, before <HI>Augustus</HI> and his first Minister cast a favour∣able Eye upon him, but his Poverty made him a Poet. Such is the Account that he gives of himself in the second <HI>Epistle</HI> of <HI>Book</HI> II.</P>
<Q><L>Quem dimisêre Philippi</L>
<L>Decisis humilem pennis, inopémque paterni</L>
<L>Et laris &amp; fundi; paupertas impulit audax,</L>
<L>Ut versus facerem.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="16"/>
If <HI>Horace</HI> was poor, <HI>Virgil</HI> was not rich, before the same magnanimous Prince, and his wise and discerning Minister, took him into their Protection. Yet he was so far from contemning Poverty, that he rather had a Con∣tempt for Riches: Witness what he makes <HI>Evander</HI> say to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> in the 8th <HI>Aeneid,</HI> when he introduces him into the homely Pa∣lace where <HI>Hercules</HI> had lain before.</P>
<Q><L>Ut ventum ad sedes; haec, inquit, limina victor</L>
<L>Alcides subiit; haec illum regia cepit.</L>
<L>Aude, hospes, contemnere opes, &amp; te quoque dignum</L>
<L>Finge Deo, rebusque veni non asper egenis.</L></Q>
<P>And in his Praise of a Country-Life, at the latter End of the second <HI>Georgic,</HI> he seems to make Poverty the Foundation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Greatness.</P>
<Q><L>Agricola incurvo terram dimovit aratro;</L>
<L>Hinc anni labor; hinc patriam, parvosque ne∣potes</L>
<L>Sustinet; hinc armenta boum, meritosque ju∣vencos.</L></Q>
<P>Now what follows a little after this?</P>
<Q><L>Hanc olim veteres vitam coluere Sabini,</L>
<L>Hanc Remus &amp; frater; sic fortis Etruria crevit,</L>
<L>Scilicet &amp; rerum facta est pulcherrima Roma.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="17"/>
Which his Friend <HI>Horace</HI> seems to have done before him, in the Ode to <HI>Augustus,</HI> Lib. I.</P>
<Q><L>Regulum &amp; Scauros, animaeque magnae</L>
<L>Prodigum paulum, superante poena,</L>
<L>Dicam &amp; insigni referem Camoena,</L>
<L>Fabriciumque.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Hunc &amp; incomptis curium capillis</L>
<L>Utilem bello tulit, &amp; Camillum</L>
<L>Saeva paupertas, &amp; avitus apto</L>
<L>Cum cure fundus.</L></Q>
<P>This I will venture to say, that there never was a great Poet in the World but he had a Contempt for Riches. Of which Opinion likewise is <HI>Horace:</HI></P>
<Q><L>—Vatis avarus</L>
<L>Non temere est animus, versus amat, hoc stu∣det unum.</L></Q>
<P>And there never was a little Poetaster, but he lov'd them, valu'd himself upon the Possession of them, and did base Things to acquire and to augment them.</P>
<P>Nothing can shew any one more weak or more base, than to prefer Fortune to Merit, or vainly and vilely to endeavour to extol Fortune and to decry Merit. God has given extraordi∣nary Merit to few, but he has subjected all to the Vicissitudes of human Affairs, as well as to Diseases
<PB N="xv" REF="18"/>
and Death. The greatest and most power∣ful of Monarchs are not exempted from the Power of Fortune, that is, from the unchange∣able and irresistible Decrees of Providence: Nay, the greater and more powerful any one is, the more deplorable Misfortunes is he subjected to. And therefore the Calamities of the Great ge∣nerally supply the fittest Subjects for so noble a Poem as Tragedy.</P>
<P>Considering the Vicissitude of human Affairs, Men of the greatest Fortune and Power ought not to value themselves upon either: But for this little Gentleman to strut and be conceited upon his having a Hundred a Year, to pretend to look down upon those whom he never had Capacity to look up to; to call their good Sense and their Reasoning Railing, because nei∣ther of them are his Talent; to say he will answer what they urge against him when he is as much <HI>in Debt</HI> as they are, at the same time that he owes his little Substance to a <HI>vile Trans∣lation</HI> of a <HI>poor</HI> but <HI>excellent</HI> Poet, who if he was not <HI>in Debt,</HI> it was because no Body would trust him: To do all this, entertains the Publick with the most ridiculous Farce in the World. Notwithstanding this, as long as he writes so scandalously as he has lately done, in so degenerate an Age he will not be without Readers: For all Fools are fond of Scandal, because all Fools are Levellers. But for the same Reasons that he has their Approbation, he is contemn'd by Men of sound Understanding.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="19"/>
And now I appeal to every impartial sensible Reader, who shall have read this, and the fol∣lowing Remarks, and who has formerly read those upon <HI>Homer, Windsor-Forest,</HI> and the <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> if I have not prov'd, both by convincing Reason and by undeniable Fact, That <HI>A. P-E</HI> has himself a just and inde∣feasible Right to all those noble Appellations and Titles, which he so foolishly, and so wrong∣fully to himself and Company, squanders away upon others.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> SHALL now, according to my Promise, send you some <HI>Observa∣tions</HI> upon the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> which is one of the last Imitations of the little mimicking Bard, and one of the most impertinent; to so high a Degree impertinent, that I am afraid of being
<PB N="2" REF="21"/>
accus'd of writing a <HI>Satire</HI> upon <HI>Nothing,</HI> as my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> wrote a <HI>Panegyrick.</HI></P>
<P>The Faults of this ridiculous Poem begin at the Title-Page. I will not insist upon the fantastical Composition of the Word <HI>Heroi∣Comical</HI>; but I desire Leave to dwell a little upon the Thing. What can this Author mean by creating in his Readers an Expectation of Pleasantry, when there is not so much as one Jest in his Book? Of all Blockheads he is the most emphatically Dull, who, to an insipid tedious Tale, prefixes this impertinent Pre∣lude; <HI>Now, Gentlemen, expect a very good Jest! Now, my Masters, prepare to laugh!</HI> Instead of <HI>Heroi-Comical,</HI> it should have been <HI>Heroi Tragical,</HI> since it seems there was a Necessity for a fantastical Word: For there is a great deal of <HI>Tragedy</HI> in this Poem, but not one Jot of <HI>Comedy.</HI> But at the same Time there is nothing so <HI>Tragical</HI> in it, as what the Author <HI>designs</HI> for <HI>Comedy:</HI> For when∣ever he aims at a <HI>Jest,</HI> 'tis such sad deplora∣ble Stuff, that he never fails to move <HI>Compas∣sion</HI> by it.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, to pass from the <HI>Title-Page</HI> to the <HI>Dedication</HI>; he need not have been at the Trouble of acquainting his fair Patroness, that he publish'd what he calls his <HI>Poem,</HI> be∣fore he had thought of what he calls his <HI>Ma∣chinery:</HI> For the Book would have told her that, without the Epistle. For what he calls
<PB N="3" REF="22"/>
his <HI>Machinery</HI> has no Manner of Influence upon what he calls his <HI>Poem,</HI> not in the least promoting, or preventing, or retarding the Action of it; as we shall shew more plainly when we come to treat of the <HI>Machines.</HI> He has taken his <HI>Machines,</HI> he tells us, from the <HI>Rosycrucians</HI>; and 'tis with them, he tells his fair Patroness, that he must bring her ac∣quainted. And how bring her acquainted? Why, he must tell her what the Count <HI>de Ga∣balis</HI> says of them, who has given, it seems, the best Account that he knows of them. If he had not too much Pride, the natural ne∣cessary Consequence of his Capacity, to be in∣structed; (for my Lord <HI>Roscomon</HI> is certainly in the Right, when he tells us, that</P>
<Q><L>Pride, of all others, the most dang'rous Fault,</L>
<L>Proceeds from Want of Sense, or Want of Thought:)</L></Q>
<P>I would direct him to a better Account of them, which is to be found in a Writer of our own, who is infinitely a better Judge both of Persons and Things, than the fantastick Count <HI>de Gabalis:</HI> and That is the most ingenious and most judicious Author of <HI>Hudibras,</HI> who has given this short Account of the <HI>Rosycrucians,</HI> in his Comment upon two Lines which are to be found in the Character of <HI>Ralpho,</HI> the facetious Squire of <HI>Hudibras, Canto</HI> I. <HI>Part</HI> 1.
<PB N="4" REF="23"/>
and which two I have chosen for the Motto to these <HI>Letters.</HI></P>
<Q><L>In <HI>Rosycrucian</HI> Lore as learned</L>
<L>As he that <HI>verè Adeptus</HI> earned.</L></Q>
<P>The short Comment upon which is this:</P>
<Q>The Fraternity of the <HI>Rosycrucians</HI> is very like the Sect of the antient <HI>Gnostici</HI>; who called themselves so from the excellent Learn∣ing they pretended to, although they were really the most ridiculous Sots of all Mankind.</Q>
<P>And then upon the Words <HI>Verè Adeptus,</HI> says he,</P>
<Q><HI>Verè Adeptus</HI> is one who has commenc'd in their Phanatick Extravagance.</Q>
<P>Thus, if we will believe <HI>Butler,</HI> who, as we said before, is an admirable Judge both of Books and of Mankind, this judicious Author of the <HI>Rape</HI> has taken what he calls his <HI>Ma∣chinery,</HI> from the <HI>Phanatick Extravagance</HI> of the most ridiculous of all modern Sots; as their Predecessors the <HI>Gnostici</HI> were the most con∣temptible ones of all the Antient; a Sect that is as becoming of this <HI>merry little Gentleman,</HI> as it was of the facetious Squire of <HI>Hudibras.</HI> And now tell me in good Earnest, Sir, is not the <HI>Fair Lady</HI> infinitely oblig'd to him for her new Acquaintance?
<PB N="5" REF="24"/>
an Acquaintance very <HI>unbecoming Her,</HI> tho' very <HI>becoming</HI> of <HI>Him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I done with the <HI>Title-Page</HI> and the <HI>Epistle.</HI> I shall proceed to Morrow upon the Body of the Book. In the mean time I will assure you for your Comfort, that you shall never have a Letter of above a Sheet of Paper at a Time upon this <HI>impertinent Sub∣ject.</HI> I am, Sir,</P>

<P>I HOPE mine of the first of this Month came to your Hands, which contain'd some Reflections upon the <HI>Dedication</HI> and <HI>Title∣Page</HI> of the <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI>; which latter creates an Expectation of <HI>Pleasantry</HI> in us, when there is not so much as one <HI>Jest</HI> in the Book.</P>
<Q><L>Quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur ineptè?</L></Q>
<P><PB N="6" REF="25"/>
How much more judiciously does <HI>Boileau</HI> ap∣pear in the <HI>Title-Page</HI> of his <HI>Lutrin?</HI> In a sottish Emulation of which, <HI>this</HI> and seve∣ral late <HI>fantastick Poems</HI> appear both to you and me to have been writ. <HI>Boileau</HI> calls his <HI>Lutrin</HI> an <HI>Heroick Poem,</HI> and he is so far from raising an <HI>Expectation</HI> of Laughter, either in the <HI>Title,</HI> or in the <HI>Beginning of the Poem,</HI> that he tells Monsieur <HI>de Lamoignon,</HI> to whom he addresses it, that 'tis a <HI>grave Subject,</HI> and must be read with a <HI>grave Countenance.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Garde toy de rire en ce grave sujet.</L>
<BIBL>Lutrin, Chant. I.</BIBL></Q>
<P><HI>Butler</HI> modestly calls his <HI>Poem,</HI> by the Name of his Hero, <HI>Hudibras</HI>; and without endeavouring to prepossess his Reader, leaves the <HI>Poem</HI> itself to work its natural Effect upon him.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, since I have said that the <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> seems to be writ in Imita∣tion of the <HI>Lutrin,</HI> (I mean so far in Imitation, that the Author had a Mind to get Reputa∣tion by writing a great many Verses upon an <HI>inconsiderable Subject,</HI> as <HI>Boileau</HI> appears to have done before him;) I believe it will not be disagreeable to you, if I shew the Difference between the <HI>Lutrin</HI> and this <HI>fantastick Poem.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> is a very <HI>empty Trifle,</HI> without any <HI>Solidity</HI> or <HI>sensible Mean∣ing</HI>; whereas the <HI>Lutrin</HI> is only a <HI>Trifle</HI> in
<PB N="7" REF="26"/>
<HI>Appearance,</HI> but under that Appearance car∣ries a very grave and very important Instruc∣tion: For if that <HI>Poem</HI> were only what it ap∣pears to be, <HI>Boileau</HI> would run counter to the <HI>fam'd Rule</HI> which he has prescrib'd to others.</P>
<Q><L>Auteurs, prêtez l' oreille à mes instructions,</L>
<L>Voulez vous faire aimer vos riches fictions?</L>
<L>Qu' en sçavantes leçons votre muse fertile,</L>
<L>Par tout joigne au plaisant le solide &amp; l' utile?</L>
<L>Un lecteur sage fuit un vain amusement,</L>
<L>Et veut mettre à profit son divertissement.</L></Q>
<P>And which <HI>Horace</HI> has given before him.</P>
<Q><L>Centuriae seniorum agitant expertia frugis:</L>
<L>Celsi praetereunt austera poemata Ramnes.</L>
<L>Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci,</L>
<L>Lectorem delectando, pariterque monendo.</L></Q>
<P>And the Rule which my Lord <HI>Roscomon</HI> has given for <HI>Translations,</HI> is certainly more strong for <HI>Originals.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Take then a Subject proper to expound,</L>
<L>But moral, great, and worth a Poet's Voice,</L>
<L>For Men of Sense despise a trivial Choice,</L>
<L>And such Applause it must expect to meet,</L>
<L>As would some Painter busy'd in a Street</L>
<L>To copy Bulls, and Bears, and every Sign,</L>
<L>That calls the staring Sots to nasty Wine.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="8" REF="27"/>
Now since 'tis impossible that so judicious an Author as <HI>Boileau</HI> should run counter to his own, and to the Instructions of his Master <HI>Horace,</HI> the <HI>Lutrin</HI> at the Bottom cannot be an <HI>empty Trifle.</HI> 'Tis indeed a noble and im∣portant satirical Poem, upon the Luxury, the Pride, the Divisions, and Animosities of the Popish Clergy. 'Tis true indeed the <HI>admirable Address</HI> of the Poet has made it in Appear∣ance a <HI>Trifle</HI>; for otherwise it would not have been suffer'd in a bigotted Popish Country. But yet <HI>Boileau</HI> in some Places seems to have given broad Hints at what was his real Mean∣ing; as in the following Passage.</P>
<Q><L>La Deesse en entrant, qui voit la nappe mise,</L>
<L>Admire un si bel ordre, &amp; reconnoit l'eglise.</L>
<BIBL>Lutrin, Chant. I.</BIBL></Q>
<P>And this other Passage is still more bold.</P>
<Q><L>Pour soutenir tes droits, que le ciel autorise,</L>
<L>Abime tout plutôt, c' est l' esprit de l'eglise.</L>
<BIBL>Lutrin, Chant. I.</BIBL></Q>
<P>As <HI>the Rape of the Lock</HI> is an <HI>empty Trifle,</HI> it can have no <HI>Fable</HI> nor any <HI>Moral</HI>; whereas the <HI>Lutrin</HI> has both <HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI> 'Tis true, indeed, the <HI>Allegory</HI> under which that <HI>Moral</HI> is conceal'd, is not so perspicuous as <HI>Boileau</HI> would have made it, if it had not been for the Apprehension of provoking the
<PB N="9" REF="28"/>
Clergy. But, on the other Side, 'tis not so obscure, but that a penetrating Reader may see through it. The Moral is, <HI>That when Chri∣stians, and especially the Clergy, run into great Heats about religious Trifles, their Animosity proceeds from the Want of that Religion which is the Pretence of their Quarrel.</HI> The Fable is this; <Q>Two Persons being deserted by true Piety, are embroil'd about a religious Trifle, to the Perplexity and Confusion of them and theirs: Upon the Return of Piety, they agree to set aside the Trifle about which they dif∣fer'd, and are reconcil'd, to the Quiet and Satisfaction both of themselves and their Partizans.</Q></P>
<P>If you will be pleased to compare the Be∣ginning of the Sixth <HI>Canto</HI> with the rest of the Poem, you will easily see that this Ac∣count which I have given of the <HI>Lutrin</HI> is not without Foundation. But you know very well, Sir, that there is not the least Shadow of a Mo∣ral or Fable in the <HI>Rape.</HI></P>
<P>As nothing could be more ridiculous than the writing a full, an exact, and a regular Cri∣ticism upon so empty a Business as this trifling Poem; I will say but a Word or two con∣cerning the <HI>Incidents,</HI> and so have done with what relates immediately to the <HI>Design.</HI> The Intention of the Author in writing this Poem, as we find in the Title-Page, is to raise the Mirth of the Reader; and we find by the Ef∣fects which <HI>Hudibras</HI> and the <HI>Lutrin</HI> produce
<PB N="10" REF="29"/>
in us, that <HI>Butler</HI> and <HI>Boileau</HI> wrote with the same Intention. Now you know very well, Sir, that in a Poem which is built upon an Action, Mirth is chiefly to be rais'd by the <HI>Incidents.</HI> For Laughter in <HI>Comedy</HI> is chiefly to be excited, like Terror and Compassion in Tragedy, by Surprize, when Things spring from one another against our Expectation. Now whereas there are <HI>several</HI> ridiculous In∣cidents in the <HI>Lutrin,</HI> as, The Owl in the Pul∣pit frighting the nocturnal Champions; The Prelate's giving his Benediction to his Adversa∣ry, by way of Revenge and Insult; The Bat∣tle in the Bookseller's Shop, &amp;c. And where∣as there are a thousand such in <HI>Hudibras</HI>; There is not so much as <HI>one,</HI> nor the <HI>Shadow of one,</HI> in the <HI>Rape of the Lock:</HI> Unless the Au∣thor's Friends will object here, That his <HI>perpe∣tual Gravity,</HI> after the <HI>Promise</HI> of his Title, makes the whole Poem one continued <HI>Jest.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE>May 8. 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I COME now to the <HI>Characters</HI> and the <HI>Machines.</HI> The Characters in the <HI>Lutrin</HI> are well mark'd. They are the true Resem∣blances of Men, of active Men, who pursue earnestly what they are about. But there is no such Thing as a Character in the <HI>Rape of the Lock. Belinda,</HI> who appears most in it, is a Chimera, and not a Character. She is repre∣sented by the Author perfectly <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>well-bred, modest</HI> and <HI>virtuous.</HI> Let us now see how he sustains these Qualities in her, and then we shall discover what Taste he has of <HI>Nature</HI> and of <HI>Decorum.</HI></P>
<P>First then he represents her perfectly <HI>beau∣tiful:</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Sol</HI> thro' white Curtains did his Beams display,</L>
<L>And op'd those Eyes which brighter shone than they.</L></Q>
<P>And thus in the next Page the Sylphs ac∣cost her:
<PB N="12" REF="31"/></P>
<Q><L>Fairest of Mortals, thou distinguish'd Care</L>
<L>Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air.</L></Q>
<P>And yet in the latter End of this very <HI>Canto</HI> he makes her owe the greater Part of her Beau∣ty to her Toilette:</P>
<Q><L>Unnumber'd Treasures ope at once, and here</L>
<L>The various Offerings of the World appear;</L>
<L>From each she nicely culls with curious Toil,</L>
<L>And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring Spoil,</L>
<L>This Casket <HI>India</HI>'s glowing Gems unlocks,</L>
<L>And all <HI>Arabia</HI> breathes from yonder Box.</L>
<L>Now awful Beauty puts on all its Arms,</L>
<L>The Fair each Moment rises in her Charms,</L>
<L>Repairs her Smiles, awakens every Grace,</L>
<L>And calls forth all the Wonders of her Face,</L>
<L>Sees by Degrees a purer Blush arise,</L>
<L>And keener Lightnings quicken in her Eyes.</L></Q>
<P>Nay, the very <HI>favourite Lock,</HI> which is made the Subject for so many Verses, is not shewn so desirable for its native Beauty, as for the con∣stant Artifice employ'd about it. Witness what <HI>Thalestris</HI> says to <HI>Belinda</HI> just after she had lost it:</P>
<Q><L>Was it for this you took such constant Care</L>
<L>The Bodkin, Comb, and Essence to prepare?</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="32"/>
For this your Locks in Paper Durance bound,</L>
<L>For this with torturing Irons wreath'd around?</L>
<L>For this with Fillets strain'd your tender Head,</L>
<L>And bravely bore the double Loads of Lead?</L></Q>
<P>Such Artifice must deface the Lustre of Locks which were naturally lovely; and the Toilette must of Necessity detract from perfect Beauty. The Toilette indeed may add to some who are call'd Beauties, or to some who would be thought such. A decay'd superannuated Beau∣ty may receive Advantage from her Toilette, may <HI>rise</HI> in her Charms, and by the Help of <HI>Spanish Red,</HI> a <HI>purer Blush may arise.</HI> But her <HI>counterfeit Charms</HI> can please none who have a Taste of <HI>Nature</HI>; according to that of <HI>Ti∣bullus:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Heu serò revocatur amor, seròque juventa,</L>
<L>Cum vetus infecit cana senecta caput.</L>
<L>Tum studium formae est, coma tùm mutatur ut annos</L>
<L>Dissimulet, viridis cortice tincta nucis.</L></Q>
<P>But for her who has Youth and Beauty;</P>
<Q><L>Illa placet quamvis, inculto venerit ore,</L>
<L>Nec nitidum tardâ compserit arte caput.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="14" REF="33"/>
Such a one wants neither <HI>Flounce</HI> nor <HI>Furbe∣low,</HI> nor <HI>torturing Irons,</HI> nor <HI>Paper Durance.</HI> When God and Nature design a Face to please, the Fair-one, on whom they bestow it, can ne∣ver add to Workmanship Divine. She may spoil it indeed by Industry, but can never im∣prove it. They, who made it, alone know the certain Ways of going to the Heart of Man, and alone can give it those resistless inimitable Graces which Industry does but spoil, and which Artifice does but hide.</P>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> was as fond of his Mistress's Hair as any modern Lover can be: Witness what he says to <HI>Maecenas</HI> in the twelfth Ode of the se∣cond Book;</P>
<Q><L>Num tu, quae tenuit dives Achaemenes,</L>
<L>Aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes</L>
<L>Permutare velis crine Licymniae,</L>
<L>Plenas aut Arabum Domos?</L></Q>
<P>And yet as he and the rest of the antient Poets had an admirable Taste of Nature, they had quite another Taste of Beauty than what this Author discovers; and believ'd that the brightest Ornament, either of the Hair or Face, was Simplicity and a becoming Negligence.</P>
<Q><L>Cui flavam religas comam</L>
<L>Simplex munditiis?</L></Q>
<P>Says <HI>Horace</HI> to <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> Ode V. Lib. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="34"/>
And in the eleventh Ode of <HI>Lib.</HI> 2.</P>
<Q><L>Quis Devium scortum eliciet domo</L>
<L>Lyden? Eburna dic age cum lyrâ</L>
<L>Maturet, incomptam Lacenae</L>
<L>More comam religata nodum.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Terence,</HI> who every where so exactly imi∣tates Nature, takes a quite different Course from this Author to shew a touching Beauty. The Passage is in the first Act of his <HI>Phormio:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Virgo pulchra! &amp; quo magis diceres,</L>
<L>Nil ad erat adjumenti ad pulchritudinem:</L>
<L>Capillus passus, nudus pes, ipsa horrida:</L>
<L>Lacrymae, vestitus turpis, ut ni vis boni</L>
<L>In ipsa inesset formâ, haec formam extin∣guerent.</L></Q>
<P>Here was no Care, neither of Hair, nor Face, nor Shape, and yet how much more charming does this <HI>Terentian</HI> Virgin appear, ev'n in Rags and Misery, than <HI>Belinda</HI> does at her Toilette? I mean to those who have a Taste of Nature. For she, who ev'n in this miserable Plight mov'd all Beholders with Pleasure, and <HI>Anti∣pho</HI> with Love, what might she not justly be suppos'd to do, adorn'd with a cleanly Negli∣gence and Simplicity? I say, <HI>adorn'd</HI> with them; for it may truly be said of every ac∣complish'd Beauty, what <HI>Tasso</HI> says of one of his:
<PB N="16" REF="35"/></P>
<Q><L>Di natura, d' amor, del cielo amici,</L>
<L>Le negligenze sue sono artifici.</L></Q>
<P>And our Ladies who spend so much Time at their Toilettes would do well to consider, that, after all the Pains which they take in adorning themselves, they who are most charm'd with their Persons, endeavour to retrieve their natu∣ral Beauty in Imagination at least, by divesting them of their borrow'd Ornaments, and cloathing them in the Simplicity of the rural Habit, when in their Sonnets they transform them to Shepherdesses.</P>
<P>But the Author has not only shewn <HI>Belinda</HI> an accomplish'd <HI>Beauty</HI>; he represents her likewise a fine, modest, <HI>well-bred</HI> Lady:</P>
<Q><L>Favours to none, to all she Smiles extends.</L>
<BIBL>Canto II.</BIBL></Q>
<P>And a little below,</P>
<Q><L>With graceful Ease and Sweetness, void of Pride.</L></Q>
<P>And yet in the very next <HI>Canto</HI> she appears an arrant Ramp and a Tomrigg;</P>
<Q><L>The Nymph exulting fills with Shouts the Sky;</L>
<L>The Walls, the Woods, and long Canals reply.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="17" REF="36"/>
Must not this be the legitimate Offspring of <HI>Stentor,</HI> to make such a Noise as that? The Nymph was within Doors, and she must set up her Throat at a hellish Rate, to make the Woods (where, by the by, there are none) and the Canals reply to it. Let us turn to the fifth <HI>Canto,</HI> and we shall see her there as loud with Anger, as she is now with Joy:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Restore the Lock,</HI> she cries, and all around</L>
<L><HI>Restore the Lock</HI> the vaulted Roofs rebound;</L>
<L>Not fierce <HI>Othello</HI> in so loud a Strain</L>
<L>Roar'd for the Handkerchief that caus'd his Pain.</L></Q>
<P>Well, but his Friends will object here, that this is an <HI>Hyperbole</HI>; and an Hyperbole is de∣sign'd to carry us beyond the Truth, only that it may make us enter more justly into it: and that when <HI>Virgil</HI> says of <HI>Camilla,</HI></P>
<Q><L>Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret</L>
<L>Gramina, nec teneres cursu laesisset aristas;</L>
<L>Vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tu menti,</L>
<L>Ferret iter, celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas;—</L></Q>
<P>He means only that <HI>Camilla</HI> was exceeding swift of Foot: Why, be it so. But then by the same Rule, must not the Author of the <HI>Rape</HI> mean, that <HI>Belinda shouted</HI> and <HI>roar'd</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="37"/>
very loud; and that, in short, she made a <HI>diabolick Din?</HI> Now is <HI>Shouting</HI> and <HI>Roaring</HI> proper for a well-bred Lady? Are they not below the Modesty and the Decency even of those <HI>sonorous</HI> Nymphs of the Flood, who haunt the Banks of the vocal <HI>Thames</HI> between the <HI>Bridge</HI> and the <HI>Tower?</HI></P>
<P>Let us look once more upon the last <HI>Canto, p.</HI> 44. Is she not a terrible <HI>Termagant</HI> there, and the exact Resemblance of <HI>Magnano</HI>'s Lady in <HI>Hudibras?</HI></P>
<Q><L>See <HI>fierce Belinda</HI> on the Baron flies,</L>
<L>With more than usual Lightning in her Eyes—</L>
<L>Now meet thy Fate, th' <HI>incens'd Virago</HI> cry'd,</L>
<L>And drew a deadly Bodkin from her Side.</L></Q>
<P>But <HI>Belinda</HI> is not only shewn <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>well-bred,</HI> she is represented <HI>virtuous</HI> too:</P>
<Q><L>Favours to none, to all she Smiles extends.</L></Q>
<P>And yet in the latter End of the fourth <HI>Canto</HI> she talks like an errant <HI>Suburbian:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Oh, hadst thou, Cruel, been content to seize</L>
<L>Hairs <HI>less in Sight,</HI> or <HI>any</HI> Hairs but these.</L></Q>
<P>Thus, Sir, has this Author given his fine La∣dy <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>good Breeding, Modesty</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> in Words, but has in Reality and in Fact made her an <HI>artificial dawbing Jilt</HI>;
<PB N="19" REF="38"/>
a <HI>Tomrig,</HI> a <HI>Virago,</HI> and a <HI>Lady of the Lake.</HI></P>
<P>There is no other Character in this Poem worth taking Notice of. I should now come to the <HI>Machines,</HI> in which you might expect to be entertain'd with something more curious and more ridiculous. But I have already de∣tain'd you too long, and must defer it till the next Opportunity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE>May 9. 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to the Promise made in my last, I am now to treat of the <HI>Machines</HI>; in the doing which I shall lie under a great Dis∣advantage: For before I come to those of the <HI>Rape,</HI> it is necessary to say something of <HI>Ma∣chines</HI> in general, of the <HI>Reason</HI> of introdu∣cing them, of the <HI>Method</HI> us'd by the antient Poets in employing them, and of the <HI>Prac∣tice</HI> of the greatest and best of the Moderns.
<PB N="20" REF="39"/>
'Tis necessary to say something to all these, in order to shew the Absurdity of our Author's <HI>Machines,</HI> and his utter Ignorance of the Art he pretends to. But to treat of all these in as ample a Manner as the Subject deserves, would require a Volume: And on the other Side, it would be extravagant to spend a great deal of Time to so insignificant an End. But when I consider that I write to a Gentleman who is perfectly well vers'd in these Matters, and who consequently will comprehend a great deal by a little, I find to my Comfort that it will be easy to avoid both those Inconveniences, of saying a great deal, and of saying no∣thing.</P>
<P>The Reasons, that first oblig'd those Poets which are call'd Heroic to introduce <HI>Machines</HI> into their <HI>Poems,</HI> were,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> To make their <HI>Fable</HI> and their <HI>Action</HI> more instructive: For, says <HI>Bossu,</HI> <Q>Lorsque les poetes sont devenus philosophes moraux, ils n' ont pas cessé d'etre theologiens. Au con∣traire, la morale quils traitent, les oblige indispensablement, de méler la divinité dans leurs Ouvrages; parceque la conoissance, la crainte, &amp; l' amour de Dieu, en un mot, la piete, &amp; la religion sont les premiers, &amp; les plus solides fondements, des autres vertus, &amp; de tout la morale.</Q></P>
<P>By introducing Machines into their Fables, the Epic Poets shew'd two Things, 1. That the great Revolutions in human Affairs are influenc'd
<PB N="21" REF="40"/>
by a particular Providence. 2. That the Deity himself promotes the Success of an Action form'd by Virtue, and conducted by Prudence. But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Heroic Poets introduc'd <HI>Ma∣chines</HI> into their Fables in order to make those Fables more <HI>delightful:</HI> For the employing <HI>Machines</HI> made the Actions of those Poems <HI>wonderful</HI>; now every Thing that is <HI>wonder∣ful</HI> is of course <HI>delightful.</HI> Let us see what one of the greatest Masters among the Mo∣derns says to this:</P>
<Q><L>Qu' Aenee &amp; ses vaisseaux par les ventes ecartez,</L>
<L>Soient aux bords Affricains d'un orage em∣portez,</L>
<L>Ce n' est qu' une avanture ordinaire &amp; com∣mune,</L>
<L>Qu' un coup peu surprenant, des traits de la fortune.</L>
<L>Mais que Junon constante en son aversion,</L>
<L>Poursvive sur les flots les restes d' Ilion,</L>
<L>Qu' Eole on sa faveur les chassant d' Italie,</L>
<L>Ouvre aux vents mutinez les prisons d Eolie,</L>
<L>Que Neptune en couroux, s'elevant sur la mer,</L>
<L>D'un mot calme les flots, mette la paix dans l' air,</L>
<L>Deliure les vaisseaux, des Syrtes les arrache,</L>
<L>C' est la ce qui surprend, frappe, saisit, at∣tache,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="41"/>
Sans tous ces ornamens le vers tombe en lan∣gueur</L>
<L>La poësie est morte, ou rampe sans vigueur;</L>
<L>Le poete n'est plus, qu'un orateur timide</L>
<L>Qu' un froid historien d'un fable insipide.</L></Q>
<P>This says the most judicious M. <HI>Despreaux</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>; and the four last Lines remind me here of what I have at large discours'd upon other Occasions, <HI>viz.</HI> That as the Epic Poets by their <HI>Machines</HI> made the <HI>Actions</HI> of their Fables more <HI>wonderful</HI> and more <HI>delightful,</HI> as well as more <HI>instructive</HI>; they likewise made the <HI>poetical Expression</HI> more <HI>wonderful</HI> and more <HI>delightful,</HI> since 'tis from them that they chiefly derive that Greatness of Expression which renders their Works so Divine.</P>
<P>I shall now come to the Practice of the an∣tient Poets, and the Method which they made use of in introducing their <HI>Machines,</HI> in order to render their Poems more <HI>instructive</HI> and more <HI>delightful.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They took their <HI>Machines</HI> from the Re∣ligion of their Country, upon which Account these <HI>Machines</HI> made the stronger Impression, and made their Fables, and the Actions of them, <HI>probable</HI> as well as <HI>wonderful</HI>; for no∣thing was more natural than for those antient Heathens to believe that the Powers which they ador'd were wont to intermeddle in human
<PB N="23" REF="42"/>
Affairs, and to promote the Success of those Designs which they favour'd; and nothing could be more natural for them, than to be∣lieve that that Design must prosper which was espous'd by <HI>Jupiter.</HI> But this was not all; for the <HI>Machines,</HI> by making the Actions of their Poems <HI>probable,</HI> made them <HI>wonderful</HI> to Men of Sense, who never can admire any Thing in Humanity which <HI>Reason</HI> will not let them believe. But,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The antient Poets made their <HI>Machines</HI> allegorical, as well as their human Persons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They oppos'd them to one another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They shew'd a just Subordination among them, and a just Proportion between their Functions. While one was employ'd about the greatest and the sublimest Things, ano∣ther was not busied about the most trifling and most contemptible.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. They always made their <HI>Machines</HI> in∣fluence the Actions of their Poems; and some of those <HI>Machines</HI> endeavour'd to <HI>advance</HI> the Action of their respective Poem, and others of them endeavour'd to <HI>retard</HI> it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. They made them infinitely more power∣ful than the human Persons.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But, Secondly, The Practice of the greatest modern Heroic Poets is conformable to that of the antient.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="24" REF="43"/>
<ITEM>1. They take their <HI>Machines</HI> from the Re∣ligion of their Country; witness <HI>Milton, Cow∣ley, Tasso.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They make them Allegorical.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They oppose them to one another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They shew a just Subordination among them, and a just Proportion between their Functions.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Rape</HI> has run counter to this Practice both of the Antients and Moderns. He has not taken his <HI>Machines</HI> from the Religion of his Country, not from any Religion, nor from Morality. His Machines contradict the Doctrines of the Christian Re∣ligion, contradict all sound Morality; there is no allegorical nor sensible Meaning in them; and for these Reasons they give no Instruction, make no Impression at all upon the Mind of a sensible Reader. Instead of making the Ac∣tion wonderful and delightful, they render it extravagant, absurd, and incredible. They do not in the least influence that Action; they neither prevent the Danger of <HI>Belinda,</HI> nor promote it, nor retard it, unless, perhaps, it may be said, for one Moment, which is ridi∣culous. And if here it be objected, that the Author design'd only to <HI>entertain</HI> and <HI>amuse</HI>; To that I answer, That for that very Reason he ought to have taken the utmost Care to
<PB N="25" REF="44"/>
make his Poem <HI>probable,</HI> according to the im∣portant Precept of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Ficta voluptatis causâ sint proxima veris.</L></Q>
<P>And that we may be satisfy'd that this Rule is founded in <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> we find by constant Experience, that any thing that shocks <HI>Probability</HI> is most insufferable in Comedy.</P>
<P>There is no Opposition of the <HI>Machines</HI> to one another in this <HI>Rape of the Lock. Um∣briel</HI> the <HI>Gnome</HI> is not introduc'd till the Action is over, and till <HI>Ariel</HI> and the Spirits under him, have quitted <HI>Belinda.</HI></P>
<P>There is no just <HI>Subordination</HI> among these <HI>Machines,</HI> nor any just <HI>Proportion</HI> between their <HI>Functions. Ariel</HI> summons them together, and talks to them as if he were their Em∣peror.</P>
<Q><L>Ye <HI>Sylphs</HI> and <HI>Sylphids,</HI> to your Chief give ear,</L>
<L><HI>Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves,</HI> and <HI>Daemons,</HI> hear;</L>
<L>Ye know the Spheres and various Tasks as∣sign'd,</L>
<L>By Laws eternal, to th' aerial Kind.</L>
<L>Some in the Fields of purest <HI>Aether</HI> play,</L>
<L>And bask and whiten in the Blaze of Day.</L>
<L>Some guide the Course of wandring Orbs on high,</L>
<L>Or roll the Planets thro' the boundless Sky—</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="45"/>
Or brew fierce Tempests on the watry Main,</L>
<L>Or o'er the Glebe distil the kindly Rain.</L>
<L>Others on Earth o'er human Race preside,</L>
<L>Watch all their Ways, and all their Actions guide:</L>
<L>Of these the Chief the Care of Nations own,</L>
<L>And guard with Arms Divine the <HI>British</HI> Throne.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, give me leave to ask you one Question: Did you ever hear before that the Planets were roll'd by the aerial Kind? We have heard indeed of Angels and Intelli∣gences who have perform'd these Functions: But they are vast glorious Beings, of <HI>Celestial</HI> Kind, and <HI>Machines</HI> of another System. Pray which of the <HI>aerial</HI> Kind have these <HI>sublime</HI> Employments? For nothing can be more ri∣diculous, or more contemptible, than the Em∣ployments of those whom he harangues</P>
<Q><L>To save the Powder from too rude a Gale,</L>
<L>Nor let th' imprison'd Essences exhale.</L></Q>
<P>There is a Difference almost infinite between these vile Functions and the former sublime ones, and therefore they can never belong to Beings of the same Species. Which of the aerial Kinds are the Movers of Orbs on high, or the Guardians of Empires below; when he who calls himself their Chief, is only the Keeper of a vile <HI>Iseland Cur,</HI> and has not so
<PB N="27" REF="46"/>
much as the Intendance of the Lady's <HI>Favourite Lock,</HI> which is the Subject of the Poem? But that is entrusted to an inferior Spirit, con∣trary to all manner of Judgment and De∣corum.</P>
<P>The <HI>Machines</HI> that appear in this Poem are infinitely less considerable than the <HI>human Per∣sons,</HI> which is without Precedent. Nothing can be so contemptible as the <HI>Persons,</HI> or so foolish as the <HI>Understandings</HI> of these <HI>Hob∣goblins. Ariel</HI>'s Speech, for the first thirty Lines, is one continu'd Impertinence: For, if what he says is true, he tells them nothing but what they knew as well as himself before. And when he comes at length to the <HI>Point,</HI> he is full as impertinent as he was in his <HI>Ramble</HI> before; for after he has talk'd to them of <HI>black Omens</HI> and <HI>dire Disasters</HI> that threa∣ten his Heroine, these Bugbears dwindle to the breaking a Piece of <HI>China,</HI> the staining a <HI>Pet∣ticoat,</HI> the losing a <HI>Necklace,</HI> a <HI>Fan,</HI> or a Bot∣tle of <HI>Sal Volatile.</HI> But we shall consider this Passage further when we come to examine the <HI>Sentiments</HI>; and then we shall see, that <HI>Sawny</HI> takes the Change here, and 'tis <HI>He,</HI> a little <HI>Lump of Flesh,</HI> that talks; instead of a little <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>That which makes this Speech more ridicu∣lous, is the Place where it is spoken, and that is upon the Sails and Cordage of <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Barge; which is certainly taken from the two Kings of <HI>Brentford</HI> descending in Clouds, and
<PB N="28" REF="47"/>
singing in the Style of our modern Spirits.</P>
<Q><L N="1"><HI>1 King.</HI> O stay, for you need not as yet go astray,</L>
<L>The Tide, like a Friend, has brought Ships in our Way,</L>
<L>And on their high Ropes we will play.</L></Q>
<P>But now, Sir, for the <HI>Persons</HI> of these Sylphs and Sylphids, you see what Ideas the Threats of <HI>Ariel</HI> give us of them, when he threatens them, that for their Neglect they shall</P>
<Q><L>Be stopt in Viols, or transfix'd with Pins,</L>
<L>Or plung'd in Lakes of bitter Washes lie,</L>
<L>Or wedg'd whole Ages in a Bodkin's Eye.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Discord</HI> is describ'd by <HI>Homer</HI> with her Feet upon the Earth, and Head in the Skies: Upon which <HI>Longinus</HI> cries out, That this is not so much the Measure of <HI>Discord,</HI> as of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Capacity,</HI> and <HI>Elevation</HI> of <HI>Genius.</HI> Ev'n so these <HI>diminutive Beings</HI> of the intellectual World, may be said to be the <HI>Measure</HI> of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Capacity</HI> and <HI>Elevation</HI> of Genius. They are, indeed, Beings so <HI>diminutive,</HI> that they bear the same Proportion to the rest of the intellectual, that Eels in Vinegar do to the rest of the material World. The latter are only to be seen thro' <HI>Microscopes,</HI> and the former only thro' the false Optics of a <HI>Rosycrucian</HI> Under∣standing.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="48"/>
I shall mention but one or two more of the numerous Defects which are to be found in the <HI>Machines</HI> of this Poem; the one is, The Spirits, which he intends for <HI>benign</HI> ones, are <HI>malignant,</HI> and those, which he designs for <HI>malignant,</HI> are <HI>beneficent</HI> to Mankind. The <HI>Gnomes</HI> he intends for <HI>malignant,</HI> and the <HI>Sylphs</HI> for <HI>beneficent</HI> Spirits. Now the <HI>Sylphs</HI> in this Poem promote that <HI>Female Vanity</HI> which the <HI>Gnomes</HI> mortify. And Vanity is not only a great Defect in Human Nature, but the Mother of a thousand Errors, and a thou∣sand Crimes, and the Cause of most of the Misfortunes which are incident to Huma∣nity.</P>
<P>The last Defect that I shall take notice of, is, That the <HI>Machines</HI> in this Poem are not ta∣ken from <HI>one System,</HI> but are <HI>double,</HI> nay <HI>tre∣ble</HI> or <HI>quadruple.</HI> In the first <HI>Canto</HI> we hear of nothing but <HI>Sylphs,</HI> and <HI>Gnomes,</HI> and <HI>Sa∣lamanders,</HI> which are <HI>Rosycrucian</HI> Visions. In the second we meet with <HI>Fairies, Genii,</HI> and <HI>Daemons,</HI> Beings which are unknown to those Fanatick Sophisters. In the fourth, <HI>Spleen</HI> and the <HI>Phantoms</HI> about, are deriv'd from the Powers of <HI>Nature,</HI> and are of a separate System. And <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Jove,</HI> which we find in the fifth <HI>Canto,</HI> belong to the Heathen Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, in treating of these Matters, I have, before I perceiv'd it, transgress'd the
<PB N="30" REF="49"/>
Bounds which I prescrib'd to my self, which I desire that you would excuse.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now shewn that there is no such Thing as a <HI>Fable</HI> or <HI>Characters</HI> in the Poem of the <HI>Rape,</HI> and that what he calls his <HI>Machinery</HI> is most extravagantly chosen. I now come to the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> which are more absurd than the rest, and of such an odd Com∣position, that they are at one and the same Time both <HI>trivial</HI> and <HI>extravagant.</HI></P>
<P>The Absurdity of the <HI>Sentiments</HI> begins with the Book, and the Author stumbles at the Threshold.</P>
<Q><L>What dire Offence from amorous Causes springs,</L>
<L>What mighty Quarrels rise from trivial Things,</L>
<L>I sing—This Verse to <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Muse is due.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="31" REF="50"/>
Where in three Lines there are no less than two Errors in the <HI>Sentiments.</HI> For, in the first Place, tho' the Author has neither <HI>Fable</HI> nor <HI>general Action,</HI> yet he proposes to sing something <HI>general,</HI> rather than that <HI>particular Action</HI> which is the <HI>Subject</HI> of his Poem, and he begins as if he design'd to make the Rea∣der expect a <HI>Treatise</HI> of Love-Quarrels; which Proceeding is just contrary to the Practice of <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and to the Dictates of <HI>right Reason. Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> had <HI>ac∣complish'd Fables,</HI> and their <HI>Actions</HI> at the Bottom were <HI>universal</HI> and <HI>allegorical:</HI> Yet they each of them propos'd to sing these <HI>Actions,</HI> as they had <HI>particulariz'd</HI> them by the Imposition of Names. <HI>Homer</HI> begins thus:</P>
<Q><L>Muse, sing the baleful Fury of <HI>Achilles.</HI></L></Q>
<P>And <HI>Virgil</HI> thus:</P>
<Q><L>Arma virumque cano, Trojae qui primus ab oris</L>
<L>Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinaque venit</L>
<L>Littora.—</L></Q>
<P>In the third Line he does not invoke the Muse to sing, but proposes to do it himself: And tho' he names the Muse immediately af∣terwards, he does it, forsooth, to acquaint her, that 'tis not she, but <HI>Belinda,</HI> that is to in∣spire him:</P>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="51"/>
<L>—This Verse to <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Muse is due,</L>
<L>This ev'n <HI>Belinda</HI> may vouchsafe to view:</L>
<L>Slight is the Subject, but not so the Praise,</L>
<L>If she inspire, and He approve my Lays.</L></Q>
<P>So that he has desir'd no Assistance from the <HI>Muse,</HI> and none she has afforded him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muse</HI> indeed could not possibly assist him in this Case. The <HI>Muse</HI> is a Machine like <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Jove,</HI> belonging originally to the <HI>Ethnic</HI> System, and transferr'd sometimes to the Christian Religion only allegorically; and the <HI>Muse</HI> cannot be suppos'd to bring him acquainted with <HI>Rosycrucian</HI> Spirits, which would destroy her own Divinity, either as Heathen or Christian, since they are Beings utterly unknown, either to the <HI>Ethnic</HI> System, or to the Christian Religion: So that 'tis <HI>Be∣linda,</HI> and not the <HI>Muse,</HI> that is to inspire him. He introduces <HI>her</HI> into the Acquaintance of the <HI>Sylphs</HI> and <HI>Sylphids</HI> in his Epistle, and she is to bring <HI>him</HI> acquainted with them in the Body of the Book. And now, Sir, is not this very <HI>ingeniously,</HI> and very <HI>judiciously</HI> contriv'd? He has desir'd no Assistance from the <HI>Muse,</HI> and, as I said before, none he has had from her. The whole Poem seems to have been infus'd by a <HI>Coquette,</HI> and not inspir'd by a <HI>Muse.</HI></P>
<P>I have already acquainted you, Sir, that I would not in the <HI>Examen</HI> of this Poem confine my self to an exact and regular Method: For neither is the Subject worth the while, nor
<PB N="33" REF="52"/>
ought a Letter to a Friend to be writ with any Restraint. I shall therefore take the <HI>Sentiments</HI> of this Poem as they come in my way, without pretending to rank them under their respective Classes, excepting perhaps the <HI>Puns,</HI> which are numerous, and by which the Author fre∣quently shocks not only the Dictates of <HI>Good Sense,</HI> and the Rules of <HI>true Pleasantry,</HI> but those of <HI>Grammar</HI> and <HI>common English.</HI> But those we shall omit till we have done with the rest.</P>
<P>There is in this first <HI>Canto, pag.</HI> 4. a very unlucky Imitation of a Passage in the sixth Book of <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Quae gratia currûm</L>
<L>Armorumque fuit vivis, quae cura nitentes</L>
<L>Pascere equos; eadem sequitur tellure repostos.</L></Q>
<P>Which the Author of the <HI>Rape</HI> has thus imi∣tated:</P>
<Q><L>Think not, when Woman's transient Breath is fled,</L>
<L>That all her Vanities at once are dead,</L>
<L>Succeeding Vanities she still regards,</L>
<L>And tho' she plays no more o'erlooks the Cards:</L>
<L>Her Joy in gilded Chariots when alive,</L>
<L>And Love of Ombre, after Death survive.</L></Q>
<P>Now there is this remarkable Difference be∣tween these two Passages, that what <HI>Virgil</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="53"/>
says of the Souls in the <HI>Elysian</HI> Fields, that they were pleas'd with the same Diversions after Death, of which they were fond in their Life-times, does by no means contradict any Doctrine of that Religion which the <HI>Romans</HI> deriv'd from the <HI>Grecians</HI>; but the Passage in the <HI>Rape</HI> shocks the fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Religion, and is therefore a most absurd Imitation.</P>
<P>I have already shewn, in speaking of the <HI>Characters,</HI> how injudicious all that Passage is, in the 8th and 9th Pages, which relates to the Toilette: And as I do not pretend to shew all his Errors, but only some few which are very gross ones, I shall now pass to the second <HI>Canto</HI>; in which <HI>Canto,</HI> pag. 11. there is a Remark that cannot but be the Effect of ve∣ry <HI>wise</HI> and very <HI>deep</HI> Observation:</P>
<Q><L>With hairy Springes we the Birds betray,</L>
<L>Slight Lines of Hair surprize the finny Prey,</L>
<L>Fair Tresses Man's impertal Race insnare,</L>
<L>And Beauty draws us with a single Hair.</L></Q>
<P>That is to say, <HI>Birds</HI> are caught by the <HI>Heels,</HI> and <HI>Fish</HI> by the <HI>Jaws,</HI> with <HI>Horse-Hair</HI>; and <HI>Men</HI> are hamper'd by the <HI>Souls</HI> with <HI>Wo∣man's Hair.</HI> Tell me truly, Sir, is not this the Effect of very <HI>wise</HI> and very <HI>deep</HI> Obser∣vation? I have been so taken with these four Verses, that I could not forbear making the four following in Imitation of them.</P>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="54"/>
<L>With jingling Bells Night-Fowlers Birds betray,</L>
<L>With these Night-Anglers catch the finny Prey:</L>
<L>Small Poets hamper Fools by jingling Rhimes,</L>
<L>And Nonsense draws them by its senseless Chimes.</L></Q>
<P>In this second <HI>Canto, pag.</HI> 12. we have ano∣ther Imitation of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and one ten times more unhappy than the former in the first <HI>Canto.</HI> The Passage of <HI>Virgil</HI> is in the second Book of the <HI>Aeneis:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Dolus, an virtus, quis in hoste requirit?</L></Q>
<P>That is to say, If a Captain obtains a Victory, few enquire whether he ow'd it to Stratagem or open Force.</P>
<P>The Imitation is included in the following Lines:</P>
<Q><L>Th' adventurous Baron the bright Lock admir'd,</L>
<L>He saw, he wish'd, and to the Prize aspir'd;</L>
<L>Resolv'd to win, he meditates the Way</L>
<L>By Force to ravish, or by Fraud betray:</L>
<L>For when Success a Lover's Toil attends,</L>
<L>Few ask, if Fraud or Force attain'd his Ends.</L></Q>
<P>Now the Mischief of it is, that if a Lover ob∣tains his Ends by <HI>Force,</HI> the whole Country makes a very severe Enquiry into it, by their
<PB N="36" REF="55"/>
Representative, a <HI>petty Jury</HI>; and if he hap∣pens to be convicted of it, in that Case poor Culprit passes his Time but scurvily.</P>
<P>In the Letter, which I lately sent you con∣cerning the <HI>Characters,</HI> I mention'd several of the <HI>Sentiments</HI> which are to be found in <HI>Ariel</HI>'s Speech: But I know not how I omitted that which follows:</P>
<Q><L>To fifty chosen Sylphs of special Note</L>
<L>We trust, th' important Charge, the Petticoat:</L>
<L>Oft have we known that sevenfold Fence to fail,</L>
<L>Though stiff with Hoops, and arm'd with Ribs of Whale.</L></Q>
<P>Where, Sir, 'tis easy to observe, that as 'tis <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Petticoat of which he commits the important Charge to the Sylphs; 'tis the Pet∣ticoat of the same <HI>Belinda,</HI> according to all <HI>English</HI> Meaning, and all true grammatical Construction, that he has known so often to fail in spight of the Hoops of Whalebone. And now I leave you to judge if there was not Reason for telling Mrs. <HI>Arabella,</HI> in the Epistle, that Madam <HI>Belinda</HI> was not like her.</P>
<P>There seems indeed to be a <HI>terrible Shock</HI> made upon the same Petticoat, in the Begin∣ning of the fifth <HI>Canto,</HI><HI> pag.</HI> 42.</P>
<Q><L>All side in Parties, and begin th' Attack,</L>
<L>Fans clap, Silks rattle, and tough Whale-bones crack.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="37" REF="56"/>
By <HI>tough Whalebones</HI> he cannot mean those of the <HI>Fans,</HI> for they are <HI>limber</HI> enough. Be∣sides, <HI>Fans</HI> were mention'd in the Beginning of this last Verse. The <HI>tough Whale-bones</HI> then, at he latter End of it, are those of the <HI>Petticoat,</HI> and could not possibly be heard to <HI>crack,</HI> unless a <HI>violent Attack</HI> had been made upon it.</P>
<P>At the Bottom of <HI>Pag.</HI> 15. <HI>Canto</HI> III. there is a very notable Thought:</P>
<Q><L>Coffee, which makes the Politician wise,</L>
<L>And see through all Things with his half-shut Eyes,</L>
<L>Sent up in Vapours to the Baron's Brain</L>
<L>New Stratagems the radiant Lock to gain.</L></Q>
<P>Now what was this <HI>new Stratagem,</HI> or these <HI>new Stratagems?</HI> Why, the Baron comes <HI>be∣hind Belinda</HI> as she was drinking her Coffee, and, snap, off goes the <HI>Lock.</HI> Now if this was the <HI>new Stratagem,</HI> what in the Name of <HI>Impertinence</HI> could be the <HI>old one?</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>profoundest</HI> and <HI>wisest</HI> Reflections of all, are at the End of this third <HI>Canto.</HI></P>
<Q><L>What Time would spare, from Steel receives its Date,</L>
<L>And Monuments, like Men, submit to Fate:</L>
<L>Steel did the Labour of the Gods destroy,</L>
<L>And strike to Dust th' imperial Tow'rs of <HI>Troy</HI>▪</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="57"/>
Steel could the Works of mortal Pride confound,</L>
<L>And hew triumphal Arches to the Ground.</L>
<L>What Wonder then, fair Nymph, thy Hair should feel</L>
<L>The conquering Force of unresisting Steel?</L></Q>
<P>Why, who the Devil, besides this Bard, ever made a Wonder of it? What! before <HI>Troy</HI> Town, and triumphal Arches were built, was the cutting off a Lock of Hair a <HI>miraculous</HI> Thing? But we may very properly apply what he says of Steel, and the cutting off a Lock of Hair to <HI>Fire,</HI> and the burning of a <HI>Faggot.</HI></P>
<Q><L>What Time would spare, from <HI>Fire</HI> receives its Date,</L>
<L>And lofty Piles, like Men, submit to Fate;</L>
<L><HI>Fire</HI> did the Work of Demi Gods consume,</L>
<L>And laid in Dust th' imperial Tow'rs of <HI>Rome</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>Fire</HI> could the Works of mortal Pride confound,</L>
<L>And level this proud City with the Ground:</L>
<L>To <HI>Fire</HI> a Victim sacred <HI>Paul</HI>'s could fall,</L>
<L>And eke the regal Turrets of <HI>Whitehall</HI>:</L>
<L>What Wonder, one poor <HI>Faggot</HI> should expire</L>
<L>By the resistless Force of conqu'ring <HI>Fire?</HI></L></Q>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Complaint which you make of my long Silence, and the Interruption of this <HI>weighty</HI> Affair, seems to be a Return to that Compliment which I design'd to make you, by discontinuing my Observations upon these arrant <HI>Bawbles.</HI> It was in Complaisance to you that I began to make them; and it was out of Respect to your Judgment that I left them off. They began to run into Length, and I thought I might as reasonably entertain you with voluminous Remarks upon <HI>Mites</HI> in <HI>Cheese,</HI> or upon <HI>Eels</HI> in <HI>Vinegar,</HI> as with te∣dious Observations on Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Poems.</P>
<P>But since 'tis your Desire that I should make an end of what I have begun. I am resolv'd to comply with it, as far as my Indisposition, and my Affairs, and the Satiety which I have con∣tracted in saying so much already, will permit me. For the Difficulty here does not lie in <HI>making Remarks,</HI> but in <HI>Reading.</HI> The Faults are so gross and so numerous, that there is no more Pleasure in finding them, than there is in hunting in a Hare-Warren.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="59"/>
I am now come to the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> which are to be found in the fourth and fifth <HI>Cantos</HI> of this notable Poem. I shall only take no∣tice of a very few, by which you and your Friends may judge of the whole.</P>
<P>The first Thing I shall take notice of, is the impertinent Journey of <HI>Umbriel</HI> the <HI>Gnome,</HI> who</P>
<Q><L>Down to the central Earth, his proper Scene,</L>
<L>Repairs to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen.</L>
<BIBL>Pag. 3.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Now to what Purpose does this fantastick Being take this Journey? Why, to give <HI>Be∣linda</HI> the Spleen. In order to which, <HI>Spleen</HI> equips him with a <HI>Bottle</HI> and a <HI>Bag,</HI> as a Country Dame does her <HI>Plough-Jobber,</HI> to equip him for his Day's Work.</P>
<Q><L>A wondrous Bag with both her Hands she binds,</L>
<L>Like that where once <HI>Ulysses</HI> held the Winds;</L>
<L>There she collects the Force of female Lungs,</L>
<L>Sighs, Sobs, and Passions, and the War of Tongues.</L>
<L>A Viol next she fills with fainting Fears,</L>
<L>Soft Sorrows, melting Griefs, and flowing Tears.</L></Q>
<P>Now what could be more impertinent than this Journey of <HI>Umbriel,</HI> or more vain and
<PB N="41" REF="60"/>
useless than this Gift of <HI>Spleen,</HI> whether we look upon the <HI>Bag</HI> or the <HI>Bottle?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Umbriel</HI> descends to the <HI>central Earth</HI> to give <HI>Belinda</HI> the <HI>Spleen.</HI> Now 'tis plain, that before his Descent he leaves her <HI>mad,</HI> and up∣on his Return, finds her in a <HI>Fit of the Mother.</HI></P>
<P>That before his Journey he leaves her <HI>mad,</HI> is I think pretty plain, from <HI>pag.</HI> 28.</P>
<Q><L>Then flash'd the livid Lightning from her Eyes,</L>
<L>And <HI>Screams</HI> of <HI>Horror</HI> rend th' <HI>affrighted</HI> Skies.</L>
<L>Not <HI>louder Shrieks</HI> by Dames to Heaven are cast—</L></Q>
<P>That upon his Return he finds her in a <HI>Fit of the Mother,</HI> is manifest from <HI>p.</HI> 35.</P>
<Q><L>Sunk in <HI>Thalestris</HI>' Arms the Nymph he found,</L>
<L>Her Eyes dejected, and her Hair unbound.</L></Q>
<P>How absurd was it then for this <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> to take a Journey down to the <HI>central Earth,</HI> for no other Purpose than to give her the <HI>Spleen,</HI> whom he left and found in the Height of it? And why does this impertinent Devil, who <HI>sees</HI> this, give himself the Trouble which he takes in the following Lines:</P>
<Q><PB N="42" REF="61"/>
<L>Full o'er their Heads the swelling Bag he rent,</L>
<L>And all the Furies issu'd at the Vent,</L>
<L><HI>Belinda</HI> burns with more than mortal Ire. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>Now, pray, what were the <HI>Furies</HI> enclos'd in this Bag? Why we were told what they were a little higher, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Force</HI> of <HI>female Lungs,</HI> and <HI>Bedlam Passions,</HI> and the <HI>War</HI> of <HI>Tongues.</HI> Now could <HI>Belinda</HI> have more of those than she had before the <HI>Gnome</HI> took his Journey?</P>
<Q><L>Then flash'd the livid Lightning from her Eyes,</L>
<L>And Screams of Horror rend th' affrighted Skies.</L></Q>
<P>And as for the <HI>Bottle,</HI> that seems like <HI>Trinca. lo</HI>'s, rather to <HI>comfort</HI> her, than to <HI>ferment</HI> her more. For let us but consider the Condi∣tion in which <HI>Umbriel</HI> found her upon his Return;</P>
<Q><L>Sunk in <HI>Thalestris</HI>' Arms the Nymph he found,</L>
<L>Her Eyes dejected, and her Hair unbound.</L></Q>
<P>That is to say, she was <HI>stark mad.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us compare this Condition with that in which she appears after she has a <HI>Dram</HI> of the <HI>Bottle?</HI></P>
<Q><L>But <HI>Umbriel,</HI> hateful Gnome, forbears not so,</L>
<L>He breaks the Viol whence the Sorrows flow.</L></Q>
<P>Now, pray, what is the Consequence? Why <HI>Be∣linda</HI> of a sudden comes to herself, holds up
<PB N="43" REF="62"/>
her Head, and is calm enough to make Re∣flections.</P>
<P>The next Thing I shall take notice of, is the <HI>Equipage</HI> of <HI>Spleen,</HI> and this Author's giving her <HI>two Handmaids,</HI> the one of which ought rather to be her <HI>Mother</HI> than her <HI>Maid,</HI> and the other can have nothing at all to do with her.</P>
<Q><L>Two Handmaids wait the Throne, alike in Place,</L>
<L>But diff'ring far in Figure and in Face.</L>
<L>Here stood Ill-Nature, <HI>like an</HI> antient <HI>Maid</HI>—</L></Q>
<P>Here the Author, with a great deal of Judg∣ment makes a <HI>Universal</HI> subordinate to a <HI>Par∣ticular. Ill-Nature</HI> may with some Colour be said to be the <HI>Mother</HI> of <HI>Spleen,</HI> but she can never be call'd her <HI>Maid,</HI> without shocking common Sense. The <HI>Nature</HI> of a Man must be <HI>coeval</HI> to the <HI>Man,</HI> and must far <HI>precede</HI> any Thing that the World calls <HI>Spleen</HI> in him. But let us take a View of her other Hand∣maid, <HI>pag.</HI> 32.</P>
<Q><L>There <HI>Affectation</HI> with a sickly Mien,</L>
<L>Shews in her Cheeks the Roses of eighteen.</L></Q>
<P>Now <HI>Affectation</HI> can never have any Thing to do with <HI>Spleen. Spleen</HI> is the <HI>Mother</HI> of <HI>Passion,</HI> which is <HI>Nature</HI>; <HI>Affectation</HI> is the <HI>Child</HI> of <HI>Tranquillity,</HI> and for the most part is nothing but <HI>counterfeit Passion.</HI> Now he, who has violent Passions of his <HI>own,</HI> is hardly
<PB N="44" REF="63"/>
at leisure to counterfeit those which are <HI>foreign</HI> to him; and therefore it has been often seen, that when too much <HI>Felicity</HI> has made a Fop <HI>affected, Spleen</HI> and <HI>Adversity</HI> have brought him back to <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>I will not take notice of the various Er∣rors in the Description of what he calls the <HI>Palace of Spleen.</HI> I shall content myself with the Mention of one of them, which may not improperly be call'd the <HI>impossible Transfor∣mation.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Unnumber'd Throngs on ev'ry Side are seen</L>
<L>Of Bodies chang'd to various Forms by Spleen;</L>
<L>Here living Tea-pots stand, one Arm held out,</L>
<L>One bent; the Handle this, and that the Spout.</L>
<L>A Pipkin there, like <HI>Homer</HI>'s Tripod walks,</L>
<L>Here sighs a Jar, and there a Goose-pie talks:</L>
<L>Men prove with Child, as pow'rful Fancy works,</L>
<L>And Maids, turn'd Bottles, call aloud for Corks.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, I appeal to you and your Friends, if ever there was such execrable Stuff, such la∣mentable, such deplorable Pleasantry! What says <HI>Horace?</HI></P>
<Q><L>Scribendi rectè sapere est &amp; principium &amp; sons.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Good Sense is the sole Foundation of good Wri∣ting.</HI> And, according to him, <HI>Boileau</HI>;</P>
<Q>


<L>Quelque sujet qu' on traite, ou plaisant, ou sub∣lime,</L>
<L>Que toujours le bon sens s'accorde avec le rime.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="45" REF="64"/>
<HI>Good Sense is the only Foundation both of Pleasantry and Sublimity:</HI> But that which is out of <HI>Truth,</HI> is certainly out of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Good Sense.</HI> Now was ever any Thing more out of <HI>Truth</HI> than the foregoing Description? Instead of giving <HI>Spleen</HI> a Power to bring <HI>me∣lancholy Delusions</HI> upon Mortals, and to cheat them with <HI>false Appearances,</HI> this Author gives her the Power really to <HI>transform Bodies,</HI> and makes <HI>Umbriel</HI> the <HI>Gnome,</HI> who, as a Spi∣rit, is suppos'd to see Things as they are, <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>really</HI> to behold that <HI>extravagant Trans∣formation.</HI> But so much for the Sentiments of the fourth <HI>Canto.</HI></P>
<P>As the fifth is very short, and very insipid, and as your humble Servant is very much tir'd, I shall make but two Observations upon it.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of it there is a <HI>rampant Scuffle,</HI> which I suppose our Author took from the <HI>Rankness</HI> of a <HI>Buttock-Ball,</HI> so little is it becoming of Persons of Condition.</P>
<Q><L>All side in Parties, and begin th' Attack,</L>
<L>Fans clap, Silks rustle, and tough Whale-bones crack,</L>
<L>Heroes and Heroines Shouts confus'dly rise,</L>
<L>And bass and treble Voices strike the Skies:</L>
<L>No common Weapons in their Hands are found,</L>
<L>Like Gods they fight, nor dread a mortal Wound.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="46" REF="65"/>
The latter Part is something odd in the Mouth of the Translator of <HI>Homer,</HI> who ought to know, that both <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> had been wounded by <HI>Diomedes.</HI> But if no <HI>common Weapons</HI> are found in the Hands of these Combatants, pray what Weapons are they which make the <HI>Silks to rustle,</HI> and the <HI>Whale∣bones to crack?</HI> But let us consider what follows:</P>
<Q><L>So when bold <HI>Homer</HI> makes the Gods engage,</L>
<L>And heavenly Breasts with human Passions rage,</L>
<L>'<HI>Gainst</HI> Pallas, Mars, Latona, Hermes <HI>arms,</HI></L>
<L>And all <HI>Olympus</HI> rings with loud Alarms:</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI>'s Thunder roars, Heav'n trembles all around,</L>
<L>Blue <HI>Neptune</HI> storms, the bellowing Deeps resound,</L>
<L>Earth shakes her nodding Tow'rs, the Ground gives way,</L>
<L>And the pale Ghosts start at the Flash of Day.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, who says that this Passage is not very justly applied to a <HI>Catterwauling?</HI> But the latter Part of it is not taken from <HI>Homer,</HI> but from his most impertinent Imitator Mon∣sieur <HI>De la Motte,</HI> and neither the one nor the other Trifler seem to have known any thing in this Passage, of the Solemnity, and the dreadful Majesty of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>In the Beginning of the next Page the fol∣lowing Lines are full of miserable Pleasantry:</P>
<Q><PB N="47" REF="66"/>
<L>While thro' the Press enrag'd <HI>Thalestris</HI> flies,</L>
<L>And scatters Death around from both her Eyes,</L>
<L>A Beau and Witling perish'd in the Throng,</L>
<L>One died in Metaphor, and one in Song.</L>
<L>O cruel Nymph! a living Death I bear,</L>
<L>Cry'd <HI>Dapperwit,</HI> and sunk beneath his Chair.</L>
<L>A mournful Glance, Sir <HI>Fopling</HI> upwards cast,</L>
<L>Those Eyes are made so killing!—was his last.</L></Q>
<P>So that here we have a <HI>real Combat</HI> and a <HI>metaphorical dying.</HI> Now is not that, Sir, very ludicrous? What, did he fight, or make Love, as Professors read, or as Popes fulmi∣nate <HI>ex Cathedrâ?</HI> I cannot imagine how he could do that, unless he had got <HI>Belinda</HI> or <HI>Thalestris</HI> upon his Lap.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I gone thro' several of the <HI>Sentiments</HI> upon the <HI>Rape,</HI> which are either <HI>trifling,</HI> or <HI>false.</HI> But there are a great many Lines, which have <HI>no Sentiment</HI> at all in them, that is, no <HI>reasonable Meaning.</HI> Such are the <HI>Puns</HI> which are every where spread throughout it. <HI>Puns</HI> bear the same Propor∣tion to <HI>Thought,</HI> that <HI>Bubbles</HI> hold to <HI>Bodies,</HI> and may justly be compared to those gaudy Bladders which Children make with Soap; which, tho' they please their weak Capacities with a momentary Glittering, yet are but just beheld, and vanish into Air. Of this Nature is that Pun in the 5<HI>th Canto, p.</HI> 44.</P>
<Q><PB N="48" REF="67"/>
<L>See fierce <HI>Belinda</HI> on the Baron flies,</L>
<L>With more than usual Lightning in her Eyes,</L>
<L>Nor fears the Chief th' unequal Fight to try,</L>
<L>Who sought no more than <HI>on</HI> his Foe to die.</L></Q>
<P>That is to say, <HI>He wish'd for nothing more than to fight with her, because he desired no∣thing more than to lie with her.</HI> Now what sensible Meaning can this have, unless he takes her for a <HI>Russian,</HI> who is to grow pas∣sionately fond of him by the extraordinary Gallantry of a lusty Bastinado? Such like∣wise is that <HI>Quibble</HI> in the following Page:</P>
<Q><L>Boast not my Fall, (he cry'd) Insulting Foe,</L>
<L>Thou by some others shalt be laid as low.</L></Q>
<P>Now we heard nothing before of the Baron's lying low. All that we heard is, that by a dextrous Toss of this <HI>modest Virgin,</HI> his No∣strils were fill'd with Snuff. So that he seems here to say the same thing to her, that <HI>Nykin</HI> says to <HI>Cocky</HI> in the <HI>Old Batchelor</HI>; <HI>I have it in my Head, but you will have it in another Place.</HI> What follows seems to be very ex∣traordinary:</P>
<Q><L>Nor think to die dejects my lofty Mind,</L>
<L>All that I dread is leaving you behind:</L>
<L>Rather than so, ah! let me still survive,</L>
<L>And burn in <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Flames, but burn alive.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="33" REF="68"/>
Now, Sir, who ever heard of a dead Man that burnt in <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Flames?</P>
<P>Of the same Nature are those numerous Banters in Rhyme, which are to be found throughout this Poem, which are so uniform, and so much of a piece, that one would swear the Author were giving a Receipt for dry Joking: For by placing something important in the Beginning of a Period, and making something very trifling follow it, he seems to take pains to bring <HI>something</HI> into a Conjun∣ction Copulative with <HI>nothing,</HI> in order to be∣get <HI>nothing.</HI> Of this there are divers Instances in <HI>Ariel</HI>'s Speech in the 2<HI>d Canto</HI>;</P>
<Q><L>This Day black Omens threat the brightest Fair</L>
<L>That e'er deserv'd the watchfull'st Spirit's Care;</L>
<L>Some dire Disaster, or by Force or Sleight,</L>
<L>But what, or where, the Fates have wrapt in Night:</L>
<L>Whether the Nymph shall break <HI>Diana</HI>'s Law,</L>
<L>Or some frail <HI>China</HI> Jar receive a Flaw,</L>
<L>Or stain her Honour, or her new Brocade,</L>
<L>Forget her Pray'rs, or miss a Masquerade,</L>
<L>Or lose her Heart, or Necklace at a Ball</L>
<L>Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that <HI>Shock</HI> must fall.</L></Q>
<P>Which, by the way, I suppose is design'd as a bitter Bob for the <HI>Predestinarians.</HI> Raillery apart, we pretend not to deny, that the very minutest Events are foredoom'd by eternal Pre∣science; but that Heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should give notice of the Death of a vile Dog, by what he calls black Omens, is a great deal too strong. Hea∣ven could do no more for <HI>Caesar</HI> himself, the
<PB N="34" REF="69"/>
very Top of the human Creation, and the Fore∣most Man of the Universe.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, give me leave to ask you one Question: Is <HI>Ariel</HI> in Jest or in Earnest, in haranguing the Spirits at this rate? Is he in Earnest? Why then even <HI>Robin Goodfellow</HI> himself is not a more senseless insignificant Hobgoblin. Is he in Jest? Why then all this is a very grand Impertinence, since it does not so much as aim at any thing: For how can the Spirits be any ways influenced by these dry Jokes of their Leader?</P>
<P>Of the same Stamp and the same Contri∣vance are these Lines in the Beginning of the 3<HI>d Canto</HI>:</P>
<Q><L>Here <HI>Britain</HI>'s Statesmen oft the Fall foredoom</L>
<L>Of foreign Tyrants, and of Nymphs at home;</L>
<L>Here Thou, great <HI>Anna,</HI> whom three Realms obey,</L>
<L>Dost sometimes Council take, and sometimes Tea;—</L>
<L>One speaks the Glory of the <HI>British</HI> Queen,</L>
<L>And one describes a charming <HI>Indian</HI> Screen.</L></Q>
<P>As I said above, Sir, is not here a Receipt for dry Joking? and can any thing be more easy than to be a Wit at this rate?</P>
<P>But so much for the <HI>Sentiments</HI> in this <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI>; I should now come to the <HI>Expression.</HI> But I have already transgress'd the Bounds I prescribed to myself, and 'tis Time to take Pity of myself and you. I am, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I am heartily tired with what I have already sent you, and am really ashamed of having pass'd a Week in thinking on such an empty jingling Trifle as the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> a wretched Rhapsody, writ for the Amusement of Boys, and Men like Boys; and tho' I am both very much indisposed at present, and very busy, yet since I have re∣ceived your Commands to send you some Re∣marks upon the <HI>Expressions</HI> in that Bawble, in order to compleat the Conversion of Mrs. <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>; I will, in Obedience to those Com∣mands, do myself a little more Violence, and will do it in as short a Time, and as small a Compass as I can; for I will confine myself to the first twelve Lines, that by the numerous Faults which will be seen in them, any one to whom you may happen to shew this Letter, may be able to judge of the rest.</P>
<P>This Rhapsody begins with Absurdity;</P>
<Q><L>What dire Offence from amorous Causes springs,</L>
<L>What mighty Contests rise from trivial things,</L>
<L>I sing—This Verse to <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Muse is due,</L>
<L>This ev'n <HI>Belinda</HI> may vouchsafe to view:</L>
<L>Slight is the Subject, but not so the Praise,</L>
<L>If she inspire, and he approve my Lays.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="36" REF="71"/>
The two first of these Lines, and the Begin∣ning of the third, are out of all Grammatical Construction: For here the Verb Active <HI>sing</HI> has no Accusative Case depending on it; as the Nominative Case is without a Verb in the Be∣ginning of the Prologue to <HI>Cato,</HI> which Pro∣logue was writ by the same little whimsical Gentleman.</P>
<P>The Word <HI>Muse</HI> is a mere Expletive, and can have nothing to do here, since 'tis <HI>Belinda</HI> only that is to inspire him.</P>
<P>There are no less than six Faults in the six Lines which he calls his Invocation:</P>
<Q><L>Say, what strange Motive, Goddess, cou'd compel</L>
<L>A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle?</L>
<L>O say, what stranger Cause, yet unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord.</L>
<L>And dwells such Rage in softest Bosoms then?</L>
<L>And dwells such daring Souls in little Men?</L></Q>
<P>Now all this, if it were not for the Rhyme, would appear, even to Fools as well as to Men of Sense, the poorest and most contemptible Stuff that ever laid the gentle Reader asleep. I would fain know what the Word <HI>Goddess</HI> in the first Line <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Muse, or <HI>Belinda. Goddess,</HI> by the usual Signification of the Word, relates to <HI>Muse,</HI> but according to Grammar and Construction, it relates to <HI>Belinda,</HI> because she was mention'd last, and she is the inspiring Person. The Word <HI>compel</HI> in the first Line likewise is a Botch for the sake of the Rhyme, the Word that should naturally have been used
<PB N="37" REF="72"/>
was either <HI>induce</HI> or <HI>provoke.</HI> The Word <HI>com∣pel</HI> supposes the Baron to be a Beast, and not a free Agent. Now, Sir, what a pretty Sense these two first Lines make:</P>
<Q><L>Say, what strange Motive, Goddess, cou'd compel</L>
<L>A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle?</L></Q>
<P>That is, what could <HI>force</HI> a <HI>well-bred</HI> Man to be damnably rude, and to shew himself an er∣rant Clown and a Brute? As for the Terms <HI>gentle Belle,</HI> they are too affected, too weak, and too low, and by no means come up to what is said to <HI>Belinda</HI> in the very next Page by <HI>Ariel</HI> the Sylph:</P>
<Q><L>Fairest of Mortals, thou distinguish'd Care</L>
<L>Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air.</L></Q>
<P>For <HI>Belle</HI> and <HI>Beau,</HI> as we have made them, as it were, <HI>English</HI> Substantives, do not signify so much as Beautiful, tho' as they are <HI>French</HI> Adjectives they have that Signification. No Man when he calls another <HI>Beau,</HI> means, that that other is handsome, but only that he takes a great deal of Poppish Care about his Dress, and gives himself a great many fantastick Airs, in order to please superficial People, and ren∣der himself ridiculous to Men of Sense. <HI>Belle</HI> has much the same Signification, and accord∣ing to the present Use and Acceptation of the Word, no more signifies a beautiful Woman than <HI>Coquette</HI> does, but only one that takes a great deal of fruitless Pains to make herself
<PB N="38" REF="73"/>
more agreeable than God and Nature have made her. But let us go on to the next Couplet:</P>
<Q><L>Oh say, what stranger Cause, yet unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?</L></Q>
<P>The Cause was, because she did not like him; a strange Cause indeed, and which required a great deal of Sagacity to find it out. But to what Purpose is the Word <HI>reject? Belinda</HI> granted him every thing that he ask'd of her. He desired to wait upon her to <HI>Hampton∣Court,</HI> and she granted it. He desired her to make one at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and she complied with that Request likewise. If she granted no more, it was because he ask'd no more: For, if we may believe herself, by what she says at the Beginning of the <HI>fourth Canto,</HI> she would have refused him nothing unless it was her <HI>favou∣rite Lock:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Oh hadst thou, cruel, been content to seize</L>
<L>Hairs less in Sight, or any Hairs but these.</L></Q>
<P>For she, who seems inclin'd to sacrifice her Mo∣desty to her Vanity, would, in all likelihood, have sacrificed it to her Pleasure. In short, the Baron is so far from making Love in this Rhapsody, that he plainly shews, by the rude Affront which he puts upon <HI>Belinda,</HI> that he expected no particular Favour from her. And indeed this Party of Pleasure at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> seems to me to look more like Catterwauling, than the Behaviour of Persons who went thither
<PB N="39" REF="74"/>
with any amorous Design. But let us proceed to the next Couplet:</P>
<Q><L>And dwells such Rage in softest Bosoms then?</L></Q>
<P>Yes, most certainly does it; and if this little Gentleman had not had a Head more soft than <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Bosom, he could never have been ca∣pable of asking so simple a Question. The softer Sex are much more subject to violent Passions than Men. <HI>Virgil</HI> shewed a Softness in <HI>Dido,</HI> which this little Gentleman is utterly incapable of comprehending; a Softness which obliged a Sovereign Queen, whose Understand∣ing was equal to her Supreme Power, or to her Greatness of Mind, to grant the last Favour to the <HI>Trojan</HI> Hero, and yet that Softness was immediately succeeded by a Rage, to whose Force, and whose noble Enthusiasm, this little Creature, who is as diminutive an Author as he is an Animal, is as utterly incapable of rai∣sing himself, as an earthly Vapour is of ascend∣ing to Heaven. But tho' nothing is more plain than that <HI>Rage</HI> may dwell in <HI>softest Bosoms,</HI> yet had it no more to do here than <HI>reject,</HI> and indeed had the less to do here because of <HI>reject:</HI> For cannot a Lady deny a Gentleman who makes a civil Request to her, but she must sall immediately into as raving a Fit, as she could have done, if he had extorted the Favour from her. <HI>Reject</HI> shews <HI>Contempt</HI> rather than <HI>Rage:</HI> It shews that she did not esteem the Baron enough to be at all angry with him. But let us come to the second Line of the Couplet:</P>
<Q><PB N="40" REF="75"/>
<L>And dwells such daring Souls in little Men?</L></Q>
<P>Yes certainly, <HI>daring Souls</HI> dwell often in <HI>little Men,</HI> and for that very Reason, because they are <HI>little Men.</HI> Did he never hear of what <HI>Statius</HI> says of little <HI>Tydeus:</HI></P>
<Q><L>—totosque infusa per artus</L>
<L>Major in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus.</L></Q>
<P>I myself know a little Monster, who, I dare venture to prophesy, will one Day shew as <HI>daring</HI> a Soul as a mad <HI>Indian</HI> who runs a muck. But what Occasion is there for <HI>daring Souls</HI> here? The Baron shews a good deal of <HI>Bru∣tality,</HI> and a good deal of <HI>Perfidy,</HI> but no <HI>Daring.</HI> He shew'd a great deal of <HI>Courage</HI> indeed, in coming treacherously behind a Lady and cutting off her favourite Lock!</P>
<P>But all this Piece, is, like <HI>Windsor Forest,</HI> or the <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> below Criticism; and there∣fore I take my Leave of you. It would be un∣reasonable to expect that you should read Re∣marks with Pleasure which I write with Pain; Remarks which may be made by the most ordi∣nary Reader, without any Penetration or any Sagacity. Besides, I have given a sufficient Sample to enable Mrs. <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> to judge of the rest. For as a Lion is known by his Claws, an Ass is known by his Ears.</P>
