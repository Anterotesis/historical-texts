<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE I am allow'd the honour, and
Privilege of so easy Access to Your
Royal Highness, I dare say, I shall not
be the worse receiv'd for bringing <HI>Ovid</HI>
along with me. He comes from Ba∣nishment
to the Fautress of Liberty;
from the Barbarous to the Polite; and has this to recom∣mend
him, which never fails with a Clemency, like Your's;
He is Unfortunate.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
Your Royal Highness, who feels for every one, has
lately been the mournful Occasion of a like Sensibility
in many Others. Scarce an Eye, that did not tell the
Danger You were in: Even Parties, tho'different in Prin∣ciples,
united at that time in their grief, and affectionate
concern, for an event of so much consequence to the In∣terest
of Humanity, and Virtue; whilst Your Self was
the only Person, Then, unmov'd.</P>
<P>It was remarkable, That She, who, with a Manner
most engaging, taught the innocent Pleasures to appear
more desirable, than the criminal; who was every day
the Life of some new agreeable Diversion; should be∣have
Her Self, upon that cruel Tryal, with a Magnanimi∣ty
so unshaken, that those who were Witnesses might
have imagin'd, She scarce ever had done any thing, but
study how to Dye.</P>
<P>It is the greatest Happiness can attend an Age un∣der
a long depravation of Morals, to be blest with Ex∣amples,
where Virtue is set off by the advantage of Birth.
Such Qualifications, when united, do not only persuade
an Imitation, but Command it. Humane Nature is al∣ways
more affected by what it sees, than what it hears of:
And as those Ideas, which enter by the Eye, find the su∣rest
passage to the Heart; so the more the Object, what∣ever
it be, seems desirable to the One, the longer it con∣tinues
in the Other.</P>
<P>There are Perfections so shining, that one must be the
very Worst of Mortals, or the very Best, not to admire
in all Those who possess them. To be blest with a dispo∣sition
to Charity, not confin'd by any other Limits, than
the Modesty of those who ask It: To know, and be rea∣dy
<PB REF="6"/>
to excuse Faults; yet, so strict in Life, as not to want
the like Indulgence; To have a Superiority of Genius
capable of judging of the highest Affairs, and an Appli∣cation
so observant, as to penetrate into the most Minute:
To be easy to lay down Grandeur upon familiar Occasi∣ons,
and discerning to take It up, when Dignity of Sta∣tion
requires; To know the politer Languages of the
present Age, as a Native, and the greater Occurrences,
and Periods of the Past, as an Historian, make up a Cha∣racter,
which is so obvious, that Every one will know
where to apply it, except the Person, whose it really is:
and if in this Your Royal Highness be at a Loss, I think
it is the only thing within the Province of Your Sex
You are ignorant of.</P>
<P>I shall take up no more of Your time in this Dedicati∣on;
because, to do every thing that may be most accep∣table
to You, shall always be the Endeavour of,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Method I propose in writing this Preface, is to take
Notice of some of the Beauties of the <HI>Metamorphoses,</HI> and
also of the Faults, and particular Affectations. After which
I shall proceed to hint at some Rules for Translation in ge∣neral;
and shall give a short Account of the following
Version.</P>
<P>I shall not pretend to impose my Opinion on others with the magisterial
Authority of a Critic; but only take the Liberty of discovering my own
Taste. I shall endeavour to show our Poet's Redundance of Wit, Justness
of Comparisons, Elegance of Descriptions, and peculiar Delicacy in touch∣ing
every Circumstance relating to the Passions, and Affections; and with
the same Impartiality, and Frankness, I shall confess the too frequent Pueri∣lities
of his luxuriant Fancy, and the too great Negligence of his some∣times
unlabour'd Versification.</P>
<P>I am not of an Opinion, too common to Translators, to think that One
is under an Obligation to extoll every thing he finds in the Author he un∣dertakes:
I am sure one is no more oblig'd to do so, than a Painter is to
make every Face that sits to him handsome. 'Tis enough if he sets the
best Features he finds in their full, and most advantageous Light. But if the
Poet has private Deformities, tho' Good-breeding will not allow to expose
him naked, yet surely there can be no Reason to recommend him, as the
most finish'd Model of Harmony, and Proportion.</P>
<P>Whoever has this undistinguishing Complaisance, will not fail to vitiate
the Taste of the Readers, and misguide many of them in their Judgment,
where to Approve, and where to Censure.</P>
<P>It must be granted, that where there appears an infinite Variety of ini∣mitable
Excellencies, it would be too harsh, and disingenuous to be severe on
such Faults, as have escap'd rather thro' want of Leisure, and Opportunity to
correct, than thro' the erroneous Turn of a deprav'd Judgment. How
sensible <HI>Ovid</HI> himself was of the Uncorrectness of the <HI>Metamorphoses,</HI> ap∣pears
from these Lines prefix'd before some of the Editions by the Care of
his Commentators;<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trist. El. vi</NOTE><L>Orba parente suo quicunque Volumina tangis,</L>
<L>His saltem veslrâ detur in urbe locus.</L>
<L>Quò{que} magis saveas; non sunt haec edita ab Illo,</L>
<L>Sed quasi de domini funere rapta sui.</L>
<L>Quicquid in his igitur vilii rude carmen habebit,</L>
<L>Emendaturus, si licuisses, erat.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="8"/>
Since therefore the Readers are not solemnly invited to an Entertainment,
but come accidentally; they ought to be contented with what they find:
And pray what have they to complain of, but too great Variety? where,
tho' some of the Dishes be not serv'd in the exactest Order, and Politeness,
but hash'd up in haste; there are a great many accommodated to every par∣ticular
Palate.</P>
<P>To like every thing, shows too little Delicacy; and to like nothing, too
much Difficulty. So great is the Variety of this Poem, that the Reader,
who is never pleas'd, will appear as monstrous, as he that is always so. Here
are the Hurries of Battles for the Heroe, tender Emotions of Soul for the
Lover, a Search, and Penetration into Nature for the Philosopher, Fluency
of Numbers, and most expressive Figures for the Poet, Morals for the Seri∣ous,
and Plaisantries for Admirers of Points of Wit.</P>
<P>'Tis certain a Poet is more to be suspected for saying too much, than too
little. To add is often hazardous; but to retrench, commonly judicious.
If our Author, instead of saying all he could, had only said all he should;
<HI>Daphne</HI> had done well to fly from the God of Wit, in order to crown his
Poet: Thus <HI>Ovid</HI> had been more honour'd, and ador'd in his Exile, than
<HI>Augustus</HI> in his Triumphs.</P>
<P>I shall now attempt to give some Instances of the Happiness, and vast Ex∣tent
of our Author's Imagination. I shall not proceed according to the
Order of the Poem, but rather transcribe some Lines here, and there, as
my Reflection shall suggest.</P>
<Q><L>Nec circumsuso pendebat in aere tellus</L>
<L>Ponderibus librata suis—</L></Q>
<P>Thus was the State of Nature before the Creation: And here it is obvi∣ous,
that <HI>Ovid</HI> had a discerning Notion of the Gravitation of Bodies. 'Tis now
demonstrated, that every Part of Matter tends to every Part of Matter with
a Force, which is always in a direct simple Proportion of the Quantity of
the Matter, and an inverse duplicate Proportion of the Distance; which Ten∣dency,
or Gravitating is constant, and universal. This Power, whatever it be,
acting always proportionably to the solid Content of Bodies, and never in any
Proportion to their Superficies; cannot be explain'd by any material Impulse.
For the Laws of Impulse are physically necessary: There can be no
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or arbitrary Principle in meer Matter; its Parts cannot move unless
they be mov'd; and cannot do otherwise, when press'd on by other Parts in
Motion; and therefore 'tis evident from the following Lines, that <HI>Ovid</HI>
strictly adher'd to the Opinion of the most discerning Philosophers, who
taught that all things were form'd by a wise, and intelligent Mind.</P>
<Q><L>Jussit &amp; extendi campos, subsidere valles,</L>
<L>Fronde tegi sylvas—</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Fiat</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Law-giver is not more sublime, than the <HI>Jussit</HI>
of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet, who goes on in the same Elevated, and Philosophical
Style.</P>
<Q><PB N="iii" REF="9"/>
<L>His super imposuit liquidum, &amp; gravitate carentem</L>
<L>Aethera—</L></Q>
<P>Here the Author spreads a thin Veil of <HI>Aether</HI> over his Infant Creation;
and tho' his asserting the upper Region to be void of Gravitation, may not,
in a Mathematical Rigour, be true; yet 'tis found from the Natural Enquities
made since, and especially from the learned Dr. <HI>Hally</HI>'s Discourse on the
<HI>Barometer,</HI> that if, on the Surface of the Earth, an Inch of Quicksilver in
the Tube be equal to a Cylinder of Air of 300 Foot, it will be at a Mile's
height equal to a Cylinder of Air of 2700000: and therefore the Air at so
great a Distance from the Earth, must be rarify'd to so great a Degree, that
the Space it fills must bear a very small Proportion to that which is entirely
void of Matter.</P>
<P>I think, we may be confident from what already appears, as well as from
what our Author has writ on the <HI>Roman</HI> Feasts, that he cou'd not be total∣ly
ignorant of Astronomy. Some of the Criticks wou'd insinuate from the
following Lines, that he mistook the annual Motion of the Sun for the
Diurnal.</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Met. B. 2.</NOTE><L>Sectus in obliquum—</L></Q>
<P>Tho' the Sun be always in one or other of the Signs of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> and
never goes by either Motion more Northward, or Southward, than is here
describ'd; Yet <HI>Phaeton</HI> being design'd to drive the Chariot but one Day,
ought to have been directed in the <HI>Aequator,</HI> or a Circle Parallel to it, and
not round the other Oblique one of the Ecliptick: a Degree of which, and
that by a Motion contrary to the Diurnal, he was obliged to go in that
length of Time.</P>
<P>I am inclin'd to think, that <HI>Ovid</HI> had so great an Attention to Poetical
Embelishments, that he voluntarily declin'd a strict Observance of any Astro∣nomical
System. For tho' that Science was far from being neglected in
former Ages; yet the Progress which was made in it, by no means equall'd
that of our present Time.</P>
<P><HI>Lucretius,</HI> tho' in other things most penetrating, describes the Sun scarce
bigger, than he appears to the Eye.</P>
<Q><L>Nec nimio solis major rota, nec minor ardor</L>
<L>Esse potest, nostris quam sensibus esse videtur.</L></Q>
<P>And <HI>Homer,</HI> imagining the Seats of the Gods above the fix'd Stars, re∣presents
the falling of <HI>Vulcan</HI> from thence to the Isle of <HI>Lemnos,</HI> to conti∣nue
during a whole Day.</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> B. 1.</NOTE><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 lines" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Poet aims here to give a surprising Idea of the height of the
Celestial Mansions: but if the Computation of a modern Astronomer be
<PB N="iv" REF="10"/>
true, they are at so much a greater Distance, that <HI>Vulcan</HI> wou'd have been
more Years in falling, than he was Minutes.</P>
<P>But least I shou'd exceed the usual Length of a Preface, I shall now give
some Instances of the Propriety of our Author's Similes, and Epithets; the
Perspicuity of his Allegories; the Instructive Excellence of the Morals; the
peculiar happy Turn of his Fancy; and shall begin with the Elegance of his
Descriptions.</P>

<P>Some of the Lines, a little foreign to the present Subject, are omitted; but
I shall make the most admirable Author amends by transcribing at length
his next Description. 'Tis of a Stag, which gave the first Occasion to the
War betwixt the <HI>Trojans</HI> and the <HI>Rutulians</HI>: I chuse this, because my De∣sign
is to have these two great Poets seen together, where the Subject hap∣pens
to be almost the same, tho' the Nature of the Poems be very different.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has also touch'd on the two last; in the one he had <HI>Lucretius</HI> in
View; in the other, <HI>Homer</HI>: and I think it will not be to the Disadvantage
of our Author to appear at the same time.</P>
<P>There are many other Descriptions scatter'd in the <HI>Metamorphoses,</HI> which,
for just Expression of Nature, and Majestick Modulation of Words, are on∣ly
Inferior to those already transcrib'd, as they are shorter; which makes
the Objection, that his Diction is commonly loytring into Prose, a great
deal too severe.</P>
<P>The <HI>Metamorphoses</HI> must be consider'd, as is observ'd before, very un∣correct;
and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Works as finish'd: tho' his own Modesty wou'd not
allow the <HI>Aeneids</HI> to be so. It seems it was harder for him to please himself,
than his Readers. His Judgment was certainly great, nor was his Vivacity
of Imagination less; for the first without the last is too heavy, and like a
Dress without Fancy; and the last without the first is too gay, and but all
Trimming.</P>
<P>Our Author's Similitudes are next to be consider'd, which are always re∣markably
short, and convey some pleasing Idea to the Imagination. 'Tis
in this Branch of the Poem, that he has discover'd as just a Judgement, as a∣ny
of the Classicks whatever. Poets, to give a Loose to a warm Fancy, are
generally too apt, not only to expatiate in their Simile's, but introduce them
too frequently; by doing the first, they detain the Attention too long from
the principal Narration; and by the latter, they make too frequent Breaches
in the Unity of the Poem.</P>
<P>Those two Errors <HI>Ovid</HI> has most discerningly avoided. How short, and
significant are generally his Comparisons! he fails not, in these, to keep a
stiff Rein on a High-mettled <HI>Pegasus</HI>; and takes care not to surfeit here, as
he has done on other Heads, by an erroneous Abundance.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="13"/>
His Simile's are thicker sown by much in the Fable of <HI>Salmacis,</HI> and <HI>Her∣maphroditus,</HI>
than in any other Book, but always short.</P>
<P>The Nymph clasps the Youth close to her Breast, and both insensibly
grow one.</P>

<P>The Objection to <HI>Ovid,</HI> that he never knows when to give over, is too
manifest. Tho' he frequently expatiates on the same Thought, in different
Words; yet in his Simile's, that Exuberance is avoided. There is in them
all a Simplicity, and a Confinement to the present Object; always a Fecun∣dity
of Fancy, but rarely an Intemperance: nor do I remember he has err'd
above once by an ill-judg'd Superfluity. After he has describ'd the Labyrinth
built by <HI>Daedalus,</HI> he compares it thus,<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 8.</NOTE><L>Non secus ac liquidus Phrygiis Maenandros in arvis</L>

I see no Reason for the last Line: Tho' the Poet be justly celebrated for a
most consummate Judgment, yet by an Endeavour to imitate <HI>Homer</HI>'s
Simile's, he is not only very long, but by introducing several Circumstan∣ces,
he fails of an applicable Relation betwixt the principal Subject, and
his new Ideas. He sometimes thinks fit to work into the Piece some diffe∣ring
Embroidery, which, tho' very rich, yet makes at best but glorious Patch∣work.
I really believe his excellent Poem had not been the less so, if, in
this Article, he had thought fit to have walk'd on in his own regular and
Majestick Grace, rather than have been hurry'd forward through broken
By-ways by his blind Guide.</P>
<P>I shall transcribe one of his Simile's which is not cull'd out, but exactly of
the same Texture with all the rest in the four last Books of the <HI>Aeneids.</HI></P>

<P>It does not seem to be at all Material, whether the Rock was blown, or

<P>But to return to <HI>Ovid</HI>; the Reader may take Notice how unforc'd his
Compliments, and how natural his Transitions generally are. With how
much Ease does he slide into some new Circumstance, without any Violation
of the Unity of the Story. The Texture is so artful, that it may be com∣par'd
to the Work of his own <HI>Arachne,</HI> where the Shade dyes so gradually,
and the Light revives so imperceptibly, that it is hard to tell where the
one ceases, and the other begins.</P>
<P>When he is going off from the Story of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and <HI>Daphne</HI>; how hap∣pily
does he introduce a Compliment to the <HI>Roman</HI> Conquerors.</P>

<P>The Author in the two first Lines shows the Affectionate Condescention
of the Father; in the three last, the pious Gratitude of the Son.</P>
<P>The Compliments to <HI>Augustus</HI> are very frequent in the last Book of the

<L>Julius—</L></Q></P>
<P>The Compliments have a great Sublimity, and worthy of the Grandeur
of the Heroes, and the Wit of the Poet.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid</HI> as much deserves Praise, for saying a great deal in a little, as Cen∣sure
for saying a little in a great deal. None of the Classick Poets had the
Talent of expressing himself with more Force, and Perspicuity.</P>
<P><HI>Phaeton</HI> desires some Pledge of his Father's Tenderness, and asks to be

<P>However, the latter complies with his Importunity: the Consequence is

<HI>Apollo</HI> courts <HI>Daphne,</HI> and promises himself Success, but is disappointed.<Q><L>Quodque cupit, sperat; suaque illum Oracula sallunt.</L></Q></P>
<P>And again,</P>

<P><PB N="x" REF="16"/>
<HI>Ovid</HI> never excells himself so much, as when he takes Occasion to touch
upon the Passion of Love; all Hearts are in a manner sensible of the same
Emotions; and, like Instruments tun'd Unisons, if a String of any one of
them be struck, the rest, by consent, vibrate.</P>
<P><HI>Procris</HI> is jealous of <HI>Cephalus</HI>; she endeavours to be confirm'd in her
Fears, but hopes the contrary,<Q><L>—Speratque miserrima falli.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next is not less Natural,<Q><L>—Sed cuncta timemus amantes.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Biblis</HI> is in love with <HI>Caunus.</HI> The Struggle is betwixt her unlawful
Flame, and her Honour.</P>
<P>She's all Confusion at the Thoughts of discovering her Passion—<Q><L>—miserere fatentis amorem.</L></Q></P>
<P>She attempts to write,<Q><L>Incipit &amp; dubitat: scribit, damnatque tabellas,</L>
<L>Et notat, &amp; delet: mutat, culpatque probatque</L></Q></P>
<P>In the End, Inclination, as it does always, gets the better of Discretion.</P>
<P>This last Fable shows how touchingly the Poet argues in Love Affairs, as
well as those of <HI>Medea,</HI> and <HI>Scylla.</HI> The two last are left by their Heroes,
and their Reflections are very Natural, and Affecting. <HI>Ovid</HI> seem'd here to
have had <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Passion of <HI>Dido</HI> in his Eye, but with this difference; the
one had convers'd much with Ladies, and knew they lov'd to talk a great
deal: The other consider'd no less what was natural for them to say, than
what became them to say.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has, through the whole Management of this Rencounter, discover'd
a most finish'd Judgment. <HI>Aeneas,</HI> like other Men, likes for Convenience,
and leaves for greater. <HI>Dido,</HI> like other Ladies, resents the Neglect, enu∣merates
the Obligations the Lover is under, upbraids him with Ingratitude,
threatens him with Revenge, then by and by submits, begs for Compassi∣on,
and has recourse to Tears.</P>
<P>It appears from this Piece, that <HI>Virgil</HI> was a discerning Master in the
Passion of Love: And they that consider the Spirit, and Turn of that inimi∣table
Line—<HI>Qui Bavium non odit</HI>—cannot doubt but he had an e∣qual
Talent for Satyr.</P>
<P>Nor does the Genius of <HI>Ovid</HI> more exert on the Subject of Love,
than on all others. In the Contention of <HI>Ajax, Ulysses</HI> his Elocuti∣on
is most nervous, and perswading. Where he endeavours to disswade Man∣kind
from indulging carnivorous Appetites in his Pythagorean Philosophy,
how emphatical is his Reasoning!</P>

I think <HI>Agricolam</HI> had been stronger, but the Authority of Manuscripts
does not warrant that Emendation.</P>
<P>Through the whole Texture of this Work, <HI>Ovid</HI> discovers the highest
Humanity, and a most exceeding good Nature. The Virtuous in Distress
are always his Concern; and his Wit contrives to give them an Immortali∣ty
with himself.</P>
<P>He seems to have taken the most Pains in the first, and second Book of
the <HI>Metamorphoses,</HI> tho' the Thirteenth abounds with Sentiments most
moving, and with calamitous Incidents, introduc'd with great Art. The
Poet had here in View, the Tragedy of <HI>Hecuba</HI> in <HI>Euripides</HI>; and 'tis a won∣der,
it has never been attempted in our own Tongue. The House of <HI>Pri∣am</HI>
is destroy'd, his Royal Daughter a Sacrifice to the <HI>Manes</HI> of him that
occasion'd it. She is forc'd from the Arms of her unhappy Friends, and hur∣ry;d
to the Altar, where she behaves herself with a Decency becoming her Sex,
and a Magnanimity equal to her Blood, and so very affecting, that even the
Priest wept.</P>
<Q><L>—Ipse etiam flens, invitusque sacerdos, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>She shows no Concern at approaching Death, but on the Account of her
old, unfortunate Mother,<Q><L>Mors tantum vellem matrem mea fallere possit.</L>
<L>Mater obest, minuitque necis mea gaudia; quamvis</L>
<L>Non mea mors illi: verum sua vita gemenda est.</L></Q></P>
<P>Then begs her Body may be deliver'd to her without Ransom,<Q><L>—Genetrici corpus inemptum</L>

<P>The unhappy Queen laments, she is not able to give her Daughter roy∣al
Burial,<Q><L>Non haec est fortuna domûs—</L></Q></P>
<P>Then takes the Body in her decrepid Arms, and halts to the Sea to wash
off the Blood,
<Q><L>—Ad littus passu processit anili</L>

<P>The animated Thoughts, and lively Images of this Poem, are numerous.
None ever painted more to the Life, than our Author, tho' several Gro∣tesque
Figures are, now and then, seen in the same Groupe. The most

endeavour to mollify his Criticks, when they give him no quarter for his

as—<HI>si quis—si non, &amp;c.</HI> and as I think he cannot be excus'd

<P>There are a great many Endings of Lines in this manner, and more in∣deed
than seems consistent with the Majesty of Heroick Verse. When Lines
are design'd to be <HI>sermoni propiores,</HI> this Liberty may be allowable, but not
so when the Subject requires more sonorous Numbers. <HI>Virgil</HI> seems to en∣deavour
to keep up his Versification to an Harmonious Dignity; and there∣fore,
when fit Words do not offer with some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, he'll rather break off in
an Hemistick, than that the Line shou'd be lazy, and languid. He well
knew how essential it was in Poetry to flatter the Ear; and at the same time
was sensible, that this Organ grows tir'd by a constant Attention to the same
Harmony; and therefore he endeavour'd now and then to relieve it by a
Cadence of Pauses, and a Variation of Measures.</P>

<P>The learned, and Reverend Dr. <HI>Clark</HI> has observ'd, (as he tells me) that
tho' there be several short Vowels made long in <HI>Homer,</HI> yet there is no In∣stance
on the contrary, of a long Vowel (such as the first Syllable of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and the like) made short, except in such a Case as that I have ci∣ted,
where the next Word begins with a Vowel; which shows, that there is
no such thing as a <HI>Poetica licentia,</HI> properly so call'd.</P>
<P>Certainly no body can imagine but these two celebrated Authors under∣stood
their own Tongue better, than the scrupulous Grammarians of After∣ages,
who are too Dogmatical, and Self-sufficient, when they presume to
censure Either of them for not attending strictly enough to Syntax, and the
Measure of Verse. The <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue is a dead Language, and none can
decide with Confidence on the Harmony, or Disonance of the Numbers of
these Times, unless they were thoroughly acquainted with their Pauses, and
Cadence. They may indeed pronounce with much more Assurance on
their Diction; and distinguish where they have been negligent, and where
more finish'd. There are certainly many Lines in <HI>Ovid,</HI> where he has been
downright Lazy, and where he might have avoided the Appearance of
being obviously so by a very little application. In recording the Succession
of the <HI>Alban</HI> Kings, thus,<Q><L>Epitus ex illo est, post hunc Capetusque, Capysque,</L>

is too much run down at present by the critical Spirit of this Nation; I
dare say, I cannot be more effectually so, than by comparing him in many

<P>I shall finish my Remarks on our Author, by taking Notice of the Just∣ness,
and Perspicuity of his Allegories; which are either Physical or Natural;
Moral; or Historical. Of the first Kind is the Fable of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and <HI>Python</HI>;
in the Explanation of this all the <HI>Mythologists</HI> agree; Exhalations and Mists
being the constant Effects of Inundations, are here dissipated by the Rays
of the Sun.</P>
<P>Of the Second Kind, are <HI>Acteon</HI> torn to Pieces by his own Pack of Dogs,
and <HI>Erisicthon</HI> starv'd by the Disease of Hunger. These two Allegories
seem to signify, that Extravagance and Luxury end in Want.</P>

a Bull in the Stern, in order to be marry'd to one of their Kings nam'd
<HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>This Explanation gives an Occasion for a Digression which is not alto∣gether
foreign to the present purpose, because it will be of Use to justify
<HI>Ovid</HI> on some other Occasions, where he is censur'd for being too free with
the Characters of the Gods. I was once representing the <HI>Metamorphoses,</HI> as
an excellent System of Morality; but an illustrious Lady, whose least
Advantage above her Sex, is that of being one of the greatest Princesses in
<HI>Europe,</HI> objected, that the loose and immodest Sallys of <HI>Jupiter</HI> did by
no means confirm my Assertion.</P>
<P>One must consider, that what appear'd an Absurdity in <HI>Ovid,</HI> is not so
much his own Fault, as that of the Times before him. The Characters of
the Gods of the old Heroick Age represented them unjust in their Actions;
mutable in their Designs; partial in their Favours; ignorant of Events; scur∣rilous
in their Language. Some of the superior Hierarchy treating one a∣nother
<PB N="xvi" REF="22"/>
with injurious Brutalities, and are often guilty of such Indecencies
and Mis-behaviour as the lowest of Mortals would blush to own. <HI>Juno</HI>
calls <HI>Diana,</HI> the Goddess of Chastity, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Brazen-fac'd Bitch.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. Il. 1. B. 21. l. 481.</NOTE> <HI>Jupi∣ter</HI>

<P>The Commentators may endeavour to hide those Absurdities under the
Veil of Allegories; but the Reader that considers the whole Texture of
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> will find, that the Author's Meaning, and their Interpretation are
often as unlike, as the imaginary Heroes of his time, are to the real ones
of Ours.</P>
<P>Allegories should be obvious, and not like Meteors in the Air, which re∣present
a different Figure to every different Eye. Now they are Armies of
Soldiers; now Flocks of Sheep; and by and by, nothing.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Criticks of a more exalted Taste, may discover such Beau∣ties
in the antient Poetry, as may escape the Comprehension of us Pigmies
of a more limited Genius. They may be able to fathom the Divine Sense of
the Pagan Theology; whist we aim at no more, than to judge of a little
common Sense.</P>
<P>It is, and ever will be a Rule to a great many, to applaud and condemn
with the general Vogue, tho' never so ill grounded. The most are affraid
of being Particular; and rather than strive against the Stream, are proud
of being in the wrong with the Many, rather than desirous of being in the
right with the Few: and tho' they be convinc'd of the Reasonableness of
dissenting from the common Cry, yet out of a poor fear of Censure, they
contribute to establish it, and thus become an Authority against others,
who in reality are but of their own Opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid</HI> was so far from paying a blind deference to the venerable Name
of his <HI>Grecian</HI> Predecessor, in the Character of his Gods; that when <HI>Ju∣piter</HI>
punishes <HI>Andromeda</HI> for the Crimes of her Mother, he calls him <HI>in∣justus
Ammon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Met. B. 4.</NOTE> and takes commonly an honourable care of the Decorum of the
Godhead, when their Actions are consistent with the Divinity of their Cha∣racter.
His Allegories include some Religious, or instructive Moral, wrap'd up
in a peculiar Perspicuity. The Fable of <HI>Proserpina,</HI> being sometimes in Hell,
and sometimes with <HI>Ceres</HI> her Mother, can scarce mean any thing else than the
sowing and coming up of Corn. The various Dresses, that <HI>Vertumnus,</HI> the
God of Seasons, puts on in his Courtship of <HI>Pomona</HI> the Garden Goddess,
seem plainly to express the different and most proper times for Digging,
Planting, Pruning, and gathering the Increase. I shall be shorter on this
Head, because our Countryman Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> has, by a laborious Search a∣mongst
the Mythologists, been very full. He has annex'd his Explanations to
the end of each Book, which deserve to be recommended to those, that are
Curious in this figurative Learning.</P>
<P>The Reader cannot fail of observing, how many excellent Lessons of Mo∣rality
<HI>Ovid</HI> has given us in the course of his Fables.</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Deucalion,</HI> and <HI>Pyrrba</HI> teaches, that Piety and Innocence
cannot miss of the divine Protection, and that the only Loss irreparable is
that of our Probity, and Justice.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="23"/>
That of <HI>Phaeton</HI>; how the too great tenderness of the Parent proves a
cruelty to the Child; and that he, who wou'd climb to the Seat of <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
generally meets with his Bolt by the way.</P>
<P>The Tale of <HI>Baucis</HI> and <HI>Philemon</HI> is most inimitably told. He omits
not the minutest Circumstance of a Cottage Life; and is much fuller than
<HI>Virgil,</HI> where he brings in his contented old Man <HI>Corycius.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">G. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Ovid</HI> repre∣sents
a good old Couple; happy, and satisfy'd in a cleanly Poverty; hospi∣table,
and free of the few things, that Fortune had given them; moderate in
Desires; affectionate in their conjugal Relation; so religious in Life, that
when they observ'd their homely Cabbin rising to a Temple, all the Boun∣ty
they ask'd of the Gods they had entertain'd, was, that they might do
the Office of Priesthood there; and at their Death, not survive one another.</P>
<P>The Stories of <HI>Lycaon,</HI> and <HI>Pentheus,</HI> not only deter from Infidelity, and
Irreverence to the Gods; but the last also shows, that too great Zeal produ∣ces
the same Effects, as none at all; and that Enthusiasm is often more cruel,
than Atheism.</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Minos,</HI> and <HI>Scylla</HI> represents the Infamy of selling our Coun∣try;
and teaches, that even they who love the Crime, abhor the Criminal.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cippus</HI> we find a noble Magnanimity, and Heavenly Self-denial: he
prefer'd the Good of the Republick to his own private Grandeur; and chose
with an exemplary Generosity, rather to live a private Free-Man out of
<HI>Rome,</HI> than to command Numbers of Slaves in it.</P>
<P>From the Story of <HI>Hercules</HI> we learn, that Glory is a Lady, who, like ma∣ny
others, loves to have her Admirers suffer a great deal for her. The
Poet enumerates the Labours of the Heroe; shows how he conquer'd eve∣ry
thing for Others, but nothing for himself: Then does him the Poe∣tical
Justice of an Apotheosis; thinking it most fit that one, who had born
the Celestial Orbs on his Shoulders, shou'd have a Mansion amongst them.</P>
<P>From the Assumption of <HI>Romulus</HI>; that when War is at an end, the chief
Business of Peace should be the enacting good Laws; that after a People
are preserv'd from the Enemy; the next care shou'd be, to preserve them
from themselves; and therefore the best Legislators deserve a Place amongst
Heroes, and Deities.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ariadne</HI> being inhumanly deserted by <HI>Theseus,</HI> and generously re∣ceiv'd
by <HI>Bacchus</HI> we find, that as there is nothing we can be sure of, so
there is nothing we ought to despair of.</P>
<P>From <HI>Althea</HI> burning the Brand; that we shou'd take care least under the
Notion of Justice, we shou'd do a Cruelty; for they that are set upon Re∣venge,
only endeavour to imitate the Injury.</P>
<P>From <HI>Polyphemus</HI> making Love to <HI>Galatea</HI> one may observe, that the
most deform'd can find something to like in thier own Person. He examines
his Face in the Stream, combs his ruful Locks with a Rake, grows more
exact, and studious of his Dress, and discovers the first Sign of being in
Love, by endeavouring at a more, than usual Care to please.</P>
<P>The Fable of <HI>Cephalus,</HI> and <HI>Procrys</HI> confirms, that every Trifle contri∣butes
to heighten the Disease of Jealousy; and that the most convincing
Proofs can scarce cure it.</P>
<P>From that of <HI>Hippomenes,</HI> and <HI>Atalanta</HI> we may discover, that a gene∣rous
Present helps to persuade, as well as an agreeable Person.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="24"/>
From <HI>Medea</HI>'s flying from <HI>Pelias</HI>'s Court; that the offer'd Favours of the
Impious should be always suspected; and that they, who design to make eve∣ry
one fear them, are afraid of every one.</P>
<P>From <HI>Myrrha</HI>; that Shame is sometimes hard to be overcome, but if
the Sex once gets the better of it, it gives them afterwards no more Trouble.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cenis</HI>; that Effeminacy in Youth may change to Valour in
Manhood, and that as Fame perishes, so does Censure.</P>
<P>From <HI>Tereus</HI>; that one Crime lays the Foundation of many; and that
the same Person, who begins with Lust, may conclude with Murther.</P>
<P>From <HI>Midas</HI>; that no Body can punish a Covetous Man worse, than
he punishes himself; that scarce any thing wou'd sometimes prove more fa∣tal
to us, than the Completion of our own Wishes; and that he who has
the most Desires, will certainly meet with the most Disappointments.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Philosophy, it may be observ'd, that Man is the
only Animal who kills his Fellow-Creature without being angry.</P>
<P>From <HI>Proteus</HI> we have this Lesson, that a Statesman can put on any
Shape; can be a Spaniel to the Lyon, and a Lyon to the Spaniel; and that
he knows not to be an Enemy, who knows not how to seem a Friend; that
if all Crowns shou'd change their Ministry, as often as they please, tho' they
may be call'd other Ministers, they are still the same Men.</P>
<P>The Legend of <HI>Aesculapiu</HI>'s Voyage to <HI>Rome</HI> in form of a Snake,
seems to express the necessary Sagacity requir'd in Professors of that Art,
for the readier Insight into Distempers: This Reptile being celebrated by
the ancient Naturalists for a quick Sight.</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hor. Sat. 3. L. 1.</NOTE><L>Cur in amicorum vitium tam cernis acutum</L>

<P>The venerable <HI>Epidaurian</HI> assum'd the figure of an Animal without
Hands to take Fees; and therefore, grateful Posterity honour'd him with
a Temple. In this manner shou'd wealthy Physitians, upon proper Oc∣casions,
practise; and thus their surviving Patients reward.</P>

<P>This Prediction has so far prov'd true, that this Poem has been ever
since the Magazine, which has furnish'd the greatest Poets of the following

and Designs. Nor has his Poetical Predecessors, and Contemporaries
paid less Regard to their own Performances.</P>

<P>The whole Ode is in a manner a continu'd Compliment to his own Wri∣tings;
nor, in Imitation of this celebrated Author, want we Poets of our
present Age, who have been pleas'd to rank themselves amongst their own
Admirers.</P>
<P>I have done with the Original, and shall make no Excuse for the length
of the Preface, because it is in the power of the Reader to make is as short
as he pleases. I shall now conclude with a Word or two about the Ver∣sion.</P>
<P>Translation is commonly either Verbal, or Paraphrase, or Imitation; of
the first sort is Mr. <HI>Sands</HI>'s, which I think the <HI>Metamorphoses</HI> can by no
means allow of. It is agreed, the Author left it unfinish'd; if it had under∣gone
his last Hand, it is more than probable, that many Superfluities had
been retrench'd. Where a Poem is perfectly finish'd; the Translation, with
regard to particular Idioms, cannot be too exact; by doing this, the Sense
of the Author is more entirely his own, and the Cast of the Periods more faith∣fully
preserv'd: But where a Poem is tedious through Exuberance, or dark
through a hasty Brevity, I think the Translator may be excus'd for doing
what the Author upon revising, wou'd have done himself.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> had been of this Opinion, perhaps other Translations of
the <HI>Metamorphoses</HI> had not been attempted.</P>
<P>A Critick has observ'd, that in his Version of this Book, he has scrupu∣lously
confin'd the Number of his Lines to those of the Original. 'Tis fit
I should take the Summ upon Content, and be better bred, than to count
after him.</P>
<P>The Manner that seems most suited for this present Undertaking, is nei∣ther
to follow the Author too close out of a Critical Timorousness; nor aban∣don
him too wantonly through a Poetick Boldness. The Original should always
be kept in View, without too apparent a Deviation from the Sense. Where
it is otherwise; it is not a Version, but an Imitation. The Translator ought
to be as intent to keep up the Gracefulness of the Poem, as artful to hide
its Imperfections; to copy its Beauties, and to throw a Shade over its Blemi∣shes;
to be faithful to an Idolatry, where the Author excells; and to take
the Licence of a little Paraphrase; where Penury of Fancy, or Dryness of
Expression seem to ask for it.</P>
<P>The Ingenious Gentlemen concern'd in this Undertaking seem to be of
this Opinion; and therefore they have not only consulted the Reputation
of the Author, but their own also. There is one of them has no other
Share in this Compliment, than by being the Occasion of engaging them
that have, in obliging the Publick. He has also so just to the Memo∣ry,
<PB N="xx" REF="26"/>
and Reputation of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> as to give his incomparable Lines the
Advantage of appearing so near his Own.</P>
<P>I cannot pass by that Admirable <HI>English</HI> Poet, without endeavouring to
make his Country sensible of the Obligations they have to his Muse. Whe∣ther
they consider the flowing Grace of his Versification; the vigorous Sal∣lies
of his Fancy; or the peculiar Delicacy of his Periods; they'll discover
Excellencies never to be enough admir'd. If they trace him from the first
Productions of his Youth, to the last Performances of his Age, they'll find,
that as the Tyranny of Rhyme never impos'd on the Perspicuity of the
Sense; so a languid Sense never wanted to be set off by the Harmony of
Rhyme. And as his earlier Works wanted no Maturity; so his latter want∣ed
no Force, or Spirit. The falling off of his Hair, had no other Con∣sequence,
than to make his Lawrels be seen the more.</P>
<P>As a Translator he was just; as an Inventer he was rich. His Versions of
some parts of <HI>Lucretius, Horace, Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> throughout, gave him
a just pretence to that Compliment which was made to <HI>Monsieur d'Ablan∣court,</HI>
a celebrated <HI>French</HI> Translater; <HI>It is uncertain who have the great∣est
Obligations to Him, the Dead or the Living.</HI></P>
<P>With all these wondrous Talents, He was Libell'd in his Life-time by the
very Men, who had no other Excellencies, but as they were his Imitators.
Where he was allow'd to have Sentiments superior to all others, they charg∣ed
him with Theft: But how did he Steal? no otherwise, than like those, that
steal Beggars Children, only to cloath them the better.</P>
<P>'Tis to be lamented, that Gentlemen still continue this unfair Behaviour,
and treat one another every Day with most injurious Libels. The Muses
should be Ladies of a chaste and fair Behaviour: when they are otherwise,
they are Furies. 'Tis certain that <HI>Parnassus</HI> is at best but a barren Moun∣tain,
and its Inhabitants contrive to make it more so by their un-neighbour∣ly
Deportment; the Authors are the only Corporation that endeavour at
the Ruin of their own Society. Every Day may convince them, how much a
rich Fool is respected above a poor Wit. The only Talents in Esteem at
present are those of <HI>Exchange-Ally</HI>; one Tally is worth a Grove of Bays;
and 'tis of much more Consequence to be well read in the Tables of Inte∣rest,
and the Rise and Fall of Stocks, than in the Revolution of Empires.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> is still a sad, and shameful Instance of this Truth: The Man, that
cou'd make Kings immortal, and raise triumphant Arches to Heroes, now
wants a poor square Foot of Stone, to show where the Ashes of one of the
greatest Poets, that ever was upon Earth, are deposited.</P>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F Bodies chang'd to various Forms I sing:</L>
<L>Ye Gods, from whom these Miracles did
spring,</L>
<L>Inspire my Numbers with Coelestial Heat;</L>
<L>Till I, my long laborious Work compleat:</L>
<L>And add perpetual Tenour to my Rhimes,</L>
<L>Deduc'd from Nature's Birth, to <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Times.</L>
<L>Before the Seas, and this Terrestrial Ball,</L>
<L>And Heav'ns high Canopy, that covers all,</L>
<L>One was the Face of Nature; if a Face,</L>
<L>Rather a rude and indigested Mass:</L>
<L>A lifeless Lump, unfashion'd, and unfram'd,</L>
<L>Of jarring Seeds; and justly <HI>Chaos</HI> nam'd.</L>
<L>No Sun was lighted up, the World to view;</L>
<L>No Moon did yet her blunted Horns renew:</L>
<L>Nor yet was Earth suspended in the Sky;</L>
<L>Nor pois'd, did on her own Foundations lye:</L>
<L>Nor Seas about the Shoars their Arms had thrown;</L>
<L>But Earth and Air and Water were in one.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="33"/>
Thus Air was void of Light, and Earth unstable,</L>
<L>And Waters dark Abyss unnavigable.</L>
<L>No certain Form on any was imprest;</L>
<L>All were confus'd, and each disturb'd the rest.</L>
<L>For hot and cold were in one Body fixt;</L>
<L>And soft with hard, and light with heavy mixt.</L>
<L>But God or Nature, while they thus contend,</L>
<L>To these intestine Discords put an end:</L>
<L>Then Earth from Air, and Seas from Earth were driv'n,</L>
<L>And grosser Air sunk from Aetherial Heav'n.</L>
<L>Thus disembroil'd, they take their proper place;</L>
<L>The next of kin, contiguously embrace;</L>
<L>And foes are sunder'd, by a larger space.</L>
<L>The force of Fire ascended first on high,</L>
<L>And took its dwelling in the vaulted Sky:</L>
<L>Then Air succeeds, in Lightness next to Fire;</L>
<L>Whose Atoms from unactive Earth retire.</L>
<L>Earth sinks beneath, and draws a numerous throng</L>
<L>Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy Seeds along.</L>
<L>About her Coasts, unruly Waters roar;</L>
<L>And, rising on a ridge, insult the Shoar.</L>
<L>Thus when the God, whatever God was he,</L>
<L>Had form'd the whole, and made the parts agree,</L>
<L>That no unequal Portions might be found,</L>
<L>He moulded Earth into a spacious Round:</L>
<L>Then with a breath, he gave the Winds to blow;</L>
<L>And bad the congregated Waters flow.</L>
<L>He adds the running Springs, and standing Lakes;</L>
<L>And bounding Banks for winding Rivers makes.</L>
<L>Some part, in Earth are swallow'd up, the most</L>
<L>In ample Oceans, disembogu'd, are lost.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="34"/>
He shades the Woods, the Vallies he restrains</L>
<L>With Rocky Mountains, and extends the Plains.</L>
<L>And as five Zones th' Aetherial Regions bind,</L>
<L>Five, Correspondent, are to Earth assign'd:</L>
<L>The Sun with Rays, directly darting down,</L>
<L>Fires all beneath, and fries the middle Zone:</L>
<L>The two beneath the distant Poles, complain</L>
<L>Of endless Winter, and perpetual Rain.</L>
<L>Betwixt th' extreams, two happier Climates hold</L>
<L>The Temper that partakes of Hot and Cold.</L>
<L>The Fields of liquid Air, inclosing all,</L>
<L>Surround the Compass of this Earthly Ball:</L>
<L>The lighter parts lye next the Fires above;</L>
<L>The grosser near the watry Surface move:</L>
<L>Thick Clouds are spread, and Storms engender there,</L>
<L>And Thunder's Voice, which wretched Mortals fear,</L>
<L>And Winds that on their Wings cold Winter bear.</L>
<L>Nor were those blustring Brethren left at large,</L>
<L>On Seas and Shoars, their fury to discharge:</L>
<L>Bound as they are, and circumscrib'd in place,</L>
<L>They rend the World, resistless, where they pass;</L>
<L>And mighty marks of mischief leave behind;</L>
<L>Such is the Rage of their tempestuous kind.</L>
<L>First <HI>Eurus</HI> to the rising Morn is sent,</L>
<L>(The Regions of the balmy Continent;)</L>
<L>And <HI>Eastern</HI> Realms, where early <HI>Persians</HI> run,</L>
<L>To greet the blest appearance of the Sun.</L>
<L><HI>Westward,</HI> the wanton <HI>Zephyr</HI> wings his flight;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the remnants of departing light:</L>
<L>Fierce <HI>Borcas,</HI> with his Off-spring, issues forth</L>
<L>T' invade the frozen Waggon of the <HI>North.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="35"/>
While frowning <HI>Auster</HI> seeks the <HI>Southern</HI> Sphere;</L>
<L>And rots, with endless Rain, th' unwholsom Year.</L>
<L>High o'er the Clouds and empty Realms of Wind,</L>
<L>The God a clearer space for Heav'n design'd;</L>
<L>Where Fields of Light, and liquid Aether flow;</L>
<L>Purg'd from the pondrous dregs of Earth below.</L>
<L>Scarce had the Pow'r distinguish'd these, when streight</L>
<L>The Stars, no longer overlaid with weight,</L>
<L>Exert their Heads, from underneath the Mass;</L>
<L>And upward shoot, and kindle as they pass,</L>
<L>And with diffusive Light, adorn their heav'nly place.</L>
<L>Then, every void of Nature to supply,</L>
<L>With forms of Gods he fills the vacant Sky:</L>
<L>New Herds of Beasts, he sends the Plains to share:</L>
<L>New Colonies of Birds, to people Air:</L>
<L>And to their Oozy Beds, the finny Fish repair.</L>
<L>A Creature of a more exalted Kind</L>
<L>Was wanting yet, and then was Man design'd:</L>
<L>Conscious of Thought, of more capacious Breast,</L>
<L>For Empire form'd, and fit to rule the rest:</L>
<L>Whether with particles of heavenly Fire</L>
<L>The God of Nature did his Soul inspire,</L>
<L>Or Earth, but new divided from the Sky,</L>
<L>And, pliant, still, retain'd th' Aetherial Energy:</L>
<L>Which wise <HI>Prometheus</HI> temper'd into paste,</L>
<L>And mixt with living Streams, the Godlike Image cast.</L>
<L>Thus, while the mute Creation downward bend</L>
<L>Their Sight, and to their Earthy Mother tend,</L>
<L>Man looks aloft; and with erected Eyes</L>
<L>Beholds his own hereditary Skies.</L>
<L>From such rude Principles our Form began;</L>
<L>And Earth was Metamorphos'd into Man.</L>

<HEAD>The GOLDEN AGE.</HEAD>
<L>The Golden Age was first; when Man yet New,</L>
<L>No Rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:</L>
<L>And, with a Native bent, did Good pursue.</L>
<L>Unforc'd by Punishment, un-aw'd by Fear,</L>
<L>His Words were simple, and his Soul sincere:</L>
<L>Needless was written Law, where none opprest:</L>
<L>The Law of Man was written in his Breast:</L>
<L>No suppliant Crowds before the Judge appear'd,</L>
<L>No Court erected yet, nor Cause was heard:</L>
<L>But all was safe, for Conscience was their Guard.</L>
<L>The Mountain-Trees in distant prospect please,</L>
<L>E'er yet the Pine descended to the Seas:</L>
<L>E'er Sails were spread, new Oceans to explore:</L>
<L>And happy Mortals, unconcern'd for more,</L>
<L>Confin'd their Wishes to their Native Shoar.</L>
<L>No Walls were yet; nor Fence, nor Mote, nor Mound,</L>
<L>Nor Drum was heard, nor Trumpet's angry sound:</L>
<L>Nor Swords were forg'd; but void of Care and Crime</L>
<L>The soft Creation slept away their time.</L>
<L>The teeming Earth, yet guiltless of the Plough,</L>
<L>And unprovok'd, did fruitful Stores allow:</L>
<L>Content with Food, which Nature freely bred,</L>
<L>On Wildings, and on Strawberries they fed;</L>
<L>Cornels and Bramble-berries gave the rest,</L>
<L>And falling Acorns furnisht out a Feast.</L>
<L>The Flow'rs unsown, in Fields and Meadows reign'd:</L>
<L>And <HI>Western</HI> Winds immortal Spring maintain'd</L>
<L>In following Years, the bearded Corn ensu'd,</L>

<L>The Sun his Annual Course obliquely made,</L>
<L>Good days contracted, and enlarg'd the bad.</L>
<L>Then Air with sultry heats began to glow;</L>
<L>The wings of Winds were clogg'd with Ice and Snow;</L>

<L>Those Houses, then, were Caves, or homely Sheds;</L>

<L>Trees rudely hollow'd, did the Waves sustain;</L>

<L>An impious, arrogant, and cruel Brood;</L>

<L>A way there is, in Heav'n's expanded Plain,</L>

<L>This Place, as far as Earth with Heav'n may vie,</L>

<L>For tho' the Foe was fierce, the Seeds of all</L>
<L>Rebellion; sprung from one Original;</L>
<L>Now, wheresoever ambient Waters glide,</L>
<L>All are corrupt, and all must be destroy'd.</L>
<L>Let me this Holy Protestation make,</L>

<L>There dwells below, a Race of Demi-Gods,</L>
<L>Of Nymphs in Waters, and of Fawns in Woods:</L>
<L>Who, tho' not worthy yet, in Heav'n to live,</L>
<L>Let 'em, at least, enjoy that Earth we give.</L>

<L>The fall of <HI>Caesar,</HI> and in him of <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>The Nations trembled with a pious fear;</L>
<L>All anxious for their Earthly Thunderer:</L>

<L>Their Murmurs, then resum'd his Speech again.</L>

<L>Cancel your pious Cares; already he</L>

<L>Yet what his Crimes, and what my Judgments were,</L>

<L>The Clamours of this vile degenerate Age,</L>
<L>The Cries of Orphans, and th' Oppressor's Rage</L>

<L>The World, and more than what I heard, I found.</L>

<L>Just at my entrance, I display'd the Sign</L>
<L>That somewhat was approaching of Divine.</L>
<L>The prostrate People pray; the Tyrant grins;</L>
<L>And, adding Prophanation to his Sins,</L>
<L>I'll try, said he, and if a God appear,</L>
<L>To prove his Deity shall cost him dear.</L>
<L>Twas late; the graceless Wretch my Death prepares,</L>
<L>When I shou'd soundly sleep, opprest with Cares:</L>
<L>This dire Experiment he chose, to prove</L>
<L>If I were Mortal, or undoubted <HI>Jove</HI>:</L>

Some Legates, sent from the <HI>Molossian</HI> State,</L>

<L>And lays the mangl'd Morsels in a Dish:</L>
<L>Some part he roasts; then serves it up, so drest,</L>
<L>And bids me welcome to this humane Feast.</L>
<L>Mov'd with disdain, the Table I o'er-turn'd;</L>

<L>The Tyrant in a fright, for shelter gains</L>
<L>The neighb'ring Fields, and scours along the Plains.</L>
<L>Howling he fled, and fain he wou'd have spoke;</L>

<L>About his Lips the gather'd Foam he churns,</L>
<L>And, breathing slaughters, still with rage he burns,</L>
<L>But on the bleating Flock his fury turns.</L>
<L>His Mantle, now his Hide, with rugged Pairs</L>
<L>Cleaves to his Back; a famish'd Face he bears;</L>
<L>His Arms descend, his Shoulders sink away</L>

<L>He grows a Wolf, his hoariness remains,</L>
<L>And the same Rage in other members reigns.</L>
<L>His Eyes still sparkle in a narr'wer space:</L>
<L>His Jaws retain the grin, and violence of his Face.</L>
<L>This was a single ruin, but not one</L>

<L>Mankind's a Monster, and th' Ungodly times</L>
<L>Confed'rate into Guilt, are sworn to Crimes.</L>
<L>All are alike involv'd in ill, and all</L>

Yet still with pity they remember Man;</L>

<L>And what he durst not burn, resolves to drown.</L>
<L>The Northern Breath, that freezes Floods, he binds;</L>
<L>With all the race of Cloud-dispelling Winds:</L>
<L>The South he loos'd, who Night and Horror brings;</L>

With Rain his Robe and heavy Mantle flow:</L>
<L>And lazy Mists are lowring on his Brow;</L>

<L>He squeez'd the Clouds, th' imprison'd Clouds resist:</L>

<L>Is <HI>Jove</HI> content to pour his Vengeance down;</L>
<L>Aid from his Brother of the Seas he craves,</L>

A Mountain of stupendous height there stands</L>
<L>Betwixt th' <HI>Athenian</HI> and <HI>Boeotian</HI> Lands,</L>
<L>The bound of fruitful Fields, while Fields they were,</L>

<L>Already <HI>Triton,</HI> at his call, appears</L>

<L>And in his hand a crooked Trumpet bears.</L>
<L>The Soveraign bids him peaceful sounds inspire;</L>

<L>His writhen Shell he takes; whose narrow vent</L>

Then gives it breath; the Blast with doubling sound,</L>

<L>The Waters, listning to the Trumpet's roar,</L>
<L>Obey the Summons, and forsake the Shoar.</L>
<L>A thin Circumference of Land appears,</L>

<L>And to <HI>Cephysus</HI> Brook their way pursue:</L>
<L>The Stream was troubled, but the Foord they knew;</L>
<L>With living Waters, in the Fountain bred,</L>
<L>They sprinkle first their Garments, and their Head,</L>
<L>Then took the way, which to the Temple led.</L>
<L>The Roofs were all defil'd with Moss and Mire,</L>
<L>The desart Altars void of Solemn Fire.</L>
<L>Before the Gradual, prostrate they ador'd;</L>
<L>The Pavement kiss'd, and thus the Saint implor'd.</L>

<L>If yet they can forgive, and yet be kind;</L>

<L>Mankind, and people desolated Earth.</L>
<L>Then thus the gracious Goddess, nodding, said;</L>
<L>Depart, and with your Vestments veil your head:</L>

<L>They ponder'd the mysterious words again,</L>

<L>This Earth our mighty Mother is, the Stones</L>
<L>In her capacious Body, are her Bones:</L>
<L>These we must cast behind. With hope and fear</L>
<L>The Woman did the new Solution hear:</L>

<L>And doubts the Gods; yet both resolve to try.</L>
<L>Descending from the Mount, they first unbind</L>
<L>Their Vests, and veil'd, they cast the Stones behind:</L>
<L>The Stones (a Miracle to Mortal View,</L>
<L>But long Tradition makes it pass for true)</L>
<L>Did first the Rigour of their Kind expel,</L>
<L>And suppled into softness, as they fell;</L>

<L>And took the Rudiments of Humane Form.</L>
<L>Imperfect Shapes: in Marble such are seen,</L>
<L>When the rude Chizzel does the Man begin;</L>
<L>While yet the roughness of the Stone remains,</L>
<L>Without the rising Muscles, and the Veins.</L>
<L>The sappy parts, and next resembling juice,</L>
<L>Were turn'd to moisture, for the Bodies use:</L>

<L>The rest, too solid to receive a bent,</L>

Converts to Bones; and what was once a Vein,</L>
<L>Its former Name and Nature did retain.</L>
<L>By help of Pow'r Divine, in little space,</L>
<L>What the Man threw, assum'd a Manly Face;</L>
<L>And what the Wife, renew'd the Female Race.</L>
<L>Hence we derive our Nature; born to bear</L>
<L>Laborious Life; and harden'd into Care.</L>
<L>The rest of Animals, from teeming Earth</L>

<L>The native moisture, in its close retreat,</L>
<L>Digested by the Sun's Aetherial Heat,</L>

<L>Then swell'd, and quicken'd by the vital Seed.</L>
<L>And some in less, and some in longer space,</L>
<L>Were ripen'd into form, and took a sev'ral face.</L>
<L>Thus when the <HI>Nile</HI> from <HI>Pharian</HI> Fields is fled,</L>

<L>The temper that results from either Kind</L>

<L>Of polish'd Iv'ry was the Cov'ring wrought:</L>

Tho' various Features did the Sisters grace,</L>
<L>A Sister's Likeness was in ev'ry Face.</L>
<L>On Earth a diff'rent Landskip courts the Eyes,</L>
<L>Men, Towns, and Beasts in distant Prospects rise,</L>
<L>And Nymphs, and Streams, and Woods, and rural Deities.</L>

<L>On either Gate were six engraven Signs.</L>
<L>Here <HI>Phaeton,</HI> still gaining on th' Ascent,</L>
<L>To his suspected Father's Palace went,</L>
<L>Till pressing forward through the bright Abode,</L>
<L>He saw at Distance the illustrious God:</L>
<L>He saw at Distance, or the dazling Light</L>

<L>The God sits high, exalted on a Throne</L>
<L>Of blazing Gems, with Purple Garments on;</L>

<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> beheld the Youth from off his Throne;</L>

<L>He saw the Boy's Confusion in his Face,</L>

The tender Sire was touch'd with what he said,</L>
<L>And flung the Blaze of Glories from his Head,</L>
<L>And bid the Youth advance: " My Son, said he,</L>
<L>" Come to thy Father's Arms! for <HI>Clymenè</HI></L>

<L>The Youth transported, asks, without Delay,</L>
<L>To guide the Sun's bright Chariot for a Day.</L>
<L>The God repented of the Oath he took,</L>
<L>For Anguish thrice his radiant Head he shook;</L>
<L>" My Son, says he, some other Proof require,</L>
<L>" Rash was my Promise, rash is thy Desire.</L>
<L>" I'd fain deny this Wish which thou hast made,</L>
<L>" Or, what I can't deny, wou'd fain disswade.</L>
<L>" Too vast and hazardous the Task appears,</L>
<L>" Nor suited to thy Strength, nor to thy Years.</L>
<L>" Thy Lot is Mortal, but thy Wishes fly</L>
<L>" Beyond the Province of Mortality:</L>
<L>" There is not one of all the Gods that dares</L>

<L>" The Steeds climb up the first Ascent with Pain,</L>
<L>" And when the middle Firmament they gain,</L>
<L>" If downward from the Heav'ns my Head I bow,</L>
<L>" And see the Earth and Ocean hang below,</L>

"Ev'n I am seiz'd with Horror and Affright,</L>

<L>" But you perhaps may hope for pleasing Woods,</L>

<L>" Nor wou'd you find it easie to compose</L>

<L>" The scorching Fire, that in their Entrails glows.</L>
<L>" Ev'n I their head-strong Fury scarce restrain,</L>
<L>" When they grow warm and restif to the Rein.</L>
<L>" Let not my Son a fatal Gift require,</L>
<L>" But, O! in time, recall your rash Desire;</L>
<L>" You ask a Gift that may your Parent tell,</L>
<L>" Let these my Fears your Parentage reveal;</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="73"/>
"And learn a Father from a Father's Care:</L>
<L>" Look on my Face; or if my Heart lay bare,</L>
<L>" Cou'd you but look, you'd read the Father there.</L>
<L>" Chuse out a Gift from Seas, or Earth, or Skies,</L>
<L>" For open to your Wish all Nature lies,</L>

<L>" Nay hang not thus about my Neck, my Son:</L>
<L>" I grant your Wish, and <HI>Styx</HI> has heard my Voice,</L>
<L>" Chuse what you will, but make a wiser Choice.</L>
<L>Thus did the God th' unwary Youth advise;</L>
<L>But he still longs to travel through the Skies.</L>
<L>When the fond Father (for in vain he pleads)</L>
<L>At length to the <HI>Vulcanian</HI> Chariot leads.</L>
<L>A Golden Axle did the Work uphold,</L>
<L>Gold was the Beam, the Wheels were orb'd with Gold.</L>
<L>The Spokes in Rows of Silver pleas'd the Sight,</L>
<L>The Seat with party-colour'd Gems was bright;</L>
<L><HI>Apollo</HI> shin'd amid the Glare of Light.</L>
<L>The Youth with secret Joy the Work surveys,</L>
<L>When now the Morn disclos'd her purple Rays;</L>
<L>The Stars were fled, for <HI>Lucifer</HI> had chase't</L>
<L>The Stars away, and fled himself at last.</L>
<L>Soon as the Father saw the rosy Morn,</L>
<L>And the Moon shining with a blunter Horn,</L>
<L>He bid the nimble <HI>Hours,</HI> without Delay,</L>
<L>Bring forth the Steeds; the nimble <HI>Hours</HI> obey:</L>
<L>From their full Racks the gen'rous Steeds retire,</L>
<L>Dropping ambrosial Foams, and snorting Fire.</L>
<L>Still anxious for his Son, the God of Day,</L>
<L>To make him Proof against the burning Ray,</L>
<L>His Temples with Celestial Ointment wet,</L>
<L>Of sov'raign Virtue to repel the Heat;</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="74"/>
Then fix'd the beamy Circle on his Head,</L>
<L>And fetch'd a deep foreboding Sigh, and said,</L>
<L>" Take this at least, this last Advice, my Son,</L>
<L>" Keep a stiff Rein, and move but gently on:</L>
<L>" The Coursers of themselves will run too fast,</L>
<L>" Your Art must be to Moderate their Haste.</L>
<L>" Drive 'em not on Directly through the Skies,</L>
<L>" But where the <HI>Zodiac</HI>'s Winding Circle lies,</L>
<L>" Along the midmost <HI>Zone</HI>; but sally forth</L>
<L>" Nor to the distant South, nor stormy North.</L>
<L>" The Horses Hoofs a beaten Track will show,</L>
<L>" But neither mount too high, nor sink too low.</L>
<L>" That no new Fires, or Heav'n, or Earth infest;</L>
<L>" Keep the mid Way, the middle Way is best.</L>
<L>" Nor, where in radiant Folds the Serpent twines,</L>
<L>" Direct your Course, nor where the Altar shines.</L>
<L>" Shun both Extreams; the rest let Fortune guide,</L>
<L>" And better for thee than thy self provide!</L>
<L>" See, while I speak, the Shades disperse away,</L>
<L>" <HI>Aurora</HI> gives the Promise of a Day;</L>
<L>" I'm call'd, nor can I make a longer Stay.</L>
<L>" Snatch up the Reins; or still th' Attempt forsake,</L>
<L>" And not my Chariot, but my Counsel take,</L>
<L>" While yet securely on the Earth you stand;</L>
<L>" Nor touch the Horses with too rash a Hand.</L>
<L>" Let Me alone to light the World, while You</L>
<L>" Enjoy those Beams which you may safely view.</L>
<L>He spoke in vain; the Youth with active Heat</L>
<L>And sprightly Vigour vaults into the Seat;</L>
<L>And joys to hold the Reins, and fondly gives</L>
<L>Those Thanks his Father with Remorse receives.</L>
<L>Mean while the restless Horses neigh'd aloud,</L>
<L>Breathing out Fire, and pawing where they stood.</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="75"/>
<HI>Tethys,</HI> not knowing what had past, gave way,</L>
<L>And all the Waste of Heav'n before 'em lay.</L>
<L>They spring together out, and swiftly bear</L>
<L>The flying Youth through Clouds and yielding Air;</L>
<L>With wingy Speed outstrip the Eastern Wind,</L>
<L>And leave the Breezes of the Morn behind.</L>
<L>The Youth was light, nor cou'd he fill the Seat,</L>
<L>Or poise the Chariot with its wonted Weight:</L>
<L>But as at Sea th' unballass'd Vessel rides,</L>
<L>Cast to and fro, the Sport of Winds and Tides;</L>
<L>So in the bounding Chariot toss'd on high,</L>
<L>The Youth is hurry'd headlong through the Sky.</L>
<L>Soon as the Steeds perceive it, they forsake</L>
<L>Their stated Course, and leave the beaten Track.</L>
<L>The Youth was in a Maze, nor did he know</L>
<L>Which way to turn the Reins, or where to go;</L>
<L>Nor wou'd the Horses, had he known, obey.</L>
<L>Then the Sev'n Stars first felt <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Ray,</L>
<L>And wish'd to dip in the forbidden Sea.</L>
<L>The folded Serpent next the frozen Pole,</L>
<L>Stiff and benum'd before, began to roll,</L>
<L>And rag'd with inward Heat, and threaten'd War,</L>
<L>And shot a redder Light from ev'ry Star;</L>
<L>Nay, and 'tis said <HI>Bootes</HI> too, that fain</L>
<L>Thou wou'd'st have fled, tho' cumber'd with thy Wane.</L>
<L>Th' unhappy Youth then, bending down his Head,</L>
<L>Saw Earth and Ocean far beneath him spread.</L>
<L>His Colour chang'd, he startled at the Sight,</L>
<L>And his Eyes Darken'd by too great a Light.</L>
<L>Now cou'd he wish the fiery Steeds untry'd,</L>
<L>His Birth obscure, and his Request deny'd:</L>
<L>Now wou'd he <HI>Merops</HI> for his Father own,</L>
<L>And quit his boasted Kindred to the Sun.</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="76"/>
So fares the Pilot, when his Ship is tost</L>
<L>In troubled Seas, and all its Steerage lost,</L>
<L>He gives her to the Winds, and in Despair</L>
<L>Seeks his last Refuge in the Gods and Pray'r.</L>
<L>What cou'd he do? his Eyes, if backward cast,</L>
<L>Find a long Path he had already past;</L>
<L>If forward, still a longer Path they find:</L>
<L>Both he compares, and measures in his Mind;</L>
<L>And sometimes casts an Eye upon the East,</L>
<L>And sometimes looks on the forbidden West.</L>
<L>The Horses Names he knew not in the Fright,</L>
<L>Nor wou'd he loose the Reins, nor cou'd he hold 'em right.</L>
<L>Now all the Horrors of the Heav'ns he spies,</L>
<L>And monstrous Shadows of prodigious Size,</L>
<L>That, deck'd with Stars, lye scatter'd o'er the Skies.</L>
<L>There is a Place above, where <HI>Scorpio</HI> bent</L>
<L>In Tail and Arms surrounds a vast Extent;</L>
<L>In a wide Circuit of the Heav'ns he shines,</L>
<L>And fills the Space of Two Coelestial Signs.</L>
<L>Soon as the Youth beheld him, vex'd with Heat,</L>
<L>Brandish his Sting, and in his Poison sweat,</L>
<L>Half dead with sudden Fear he dropt the Reins;</L>
<L>The Horses felt 'em loose upon their Mains,</L>
<L>And, flying out through all the Plains above,</L>
<L>Ran uncontroul'd where-e'er their Fury drove;</L>
<L>Rush'd on the Stars, and through a pathless Way</L>
<L>Of unknown Regions hurry'd on the Day.</L>
<L>And now above, and now below they flew,</L>
<L>And near the Earth the burning Chariot drew.</L>
<L>The Clouds disperse in Fumes, the wond'ring Moon</L>
<L>Beholds her Brother's Steeds beneath her own;</L>
<L>The Highlands smoak, cleft by the piercing Rays,</L>
<L>Or, clad with Woods, in their own Fewel blaze.</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="77"/>
Next o'er the Plains, where ripen'd Harvests grow,</L>
<L>The running Conflagration spreads Below.</L>
<L>But these are trivial Ills: whole Cities burn,</L>
<L>And peopled Kingdoms into Ashes turn.</L>
<L>The Mountains kindle as the Car draws near,</L>

<L>High <HI>Pindus, Mimas,</HI> and <HI>Parnassus,</HI> sweat,</L>

<L>Ev'n <HI>Scythia,</HI> through her hoary Regions warm'd,</L>

<L>And <HI>Caucasus,</HI> and proud <HI>Olympus,</HI> shine;</L>
<L>And, where the long-extended <HI>Alpes</HI> aspire,</L>
<L>Now stands a huge continu'd Range of Fire.</L>
<L>Th' astonisht Youth, where-e'er his Eyes cou'd turn,</L>
<L>Beheld the Universe around him burn:</L>
<L>The World was in a Blaze; nor cou'd he bear</L>
<L>The sultry Vapours and the scorching Air,</L>
<L>Which from below, as from a Furnace, flow'd;</L>
<L>And now the Axle-tree beneath him glow'd:</L>

<L>And white with Ashes, hov'ring in the Smoke,</L>

<L>Walk'd the wide Circuit of the Heav'ns above,</L>

<L>But all was Safe: The Earth he then survey'd,</L>

<L>Her Fields he cloath'd, and chear'd her blasted Face</L>

<L>His Teeth stood jaggy in Three dreadful Rows.</L>
<L>The <HI>Tyrians</HI> in the Den for Water sought,</L>
<L>And with their Urns explor'd the hollow Vault:</L>

<L>The <HI>Tyrians</HI> drop their Vessels in the Fright,</L>

<L>Spire above Spire uprear'd in Air he stood,</L>

<L>In vain the <HI>Tyrians</HI> on their Arms rely,</L>

<L>In all its Lustre, to the Noon-day Sky;</L>
<L>When, anxious for his Friends, and fill'd with Cares,</L>
<L>To search the Woods th' impatient Chief prepares.</L>
<L>A Lion's Hide around his Loins he wore,</L>
<L>The well-poiz'd Jav'lin to the Field he bore</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="109"/>
Inur'd to Blood; the far-destroying Dart;</L>
<L>And, the best Weapon, an undaunted Heart.</L>
<L>Soon as the Youth approach'd the fatal Place,</L>
<L>He saw his Servants breathless on the Grass;</L>
<L>The scaly Foe amid their Corps he view'd,</L>
<L>Basking at Ease, and feasting in their Blood.</L>
<L>" Such Friends, he cries, deserv'd a longer Date;</L>

<L>But nothing here th' unweildy Rock avails,</L>
<L>Rebounding harmless from the plaited Scales,</L>
<L>That, firmly join'd, preserv'd him from a Wound,</L>

<L>The pointed Jav'lin more successful flew,</L>
<L>Which at his Back the raging Warriour threw;</L>
<L>Amid the plaited Scales it took its Course,</L>
<L>And in the spinal Marrow spent its Force.</L>
<L>The Monster hiss'd aloud, and rag'd in vain,</L>
<L>And writh'd his Body to and fro with Pain;</L>
<L>And bit the Spear, and wrench'd the Wood away;</L>
<L>The Point still buried in the Marrow lay.</L>
<L>And now his Rage, increasing with his Pain,</L>
<L>Reddens his Eyes, and beats in ev'ry Vein;</L>
<L>Churn'd in his Teeth the foamy Venom rose,</L>
<L>Whilst from his Mouth a Blast of Vapours flows,</L>
<L>Such as th' Infernal <HI>Stygian</HI> Waters cast.</L>
<L>The Plants around him wither in the Blast.</L>
<L>Now in a Maze of Rings he lies enrowl'd,</L>
<L>Now all unravel'd, and without a Fold;</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="110"/>
Now, like a Torrent, with a mighty Force</L>
<L>Bears down the Forest in his boist'rous Course.</L>
<L><HI>Cadmus</HI> gave back, and on the Lion's Spoil</L>
<L>Sustain'd the Shock, then forc'd him to recoil;</L>
<L>The pointed Jav'lin warded off his Rage:</L>
<L>Mad with his Pains, and furious to engage,</L>
<L>The Serpent champs the Steel, and bites the Spear,</L>
<L>'Till Blood and Venom all the Point besmear.</L>
<L>But still the Hurt he yet receiv'd was slight;</L>
<L>For, whilst the Champion with redoubled Might</L>
<L>Strikes home the Jav'lin, his retiring Foe</L>
<L>Shrinks from the Wound, and disappoints the Blow.</L>
<L>The dauntless Heroe still pursues his Stroke,</L>
<L>And presses forward, 'till a knotty Oak</L>
<L>Retards his Foe, and stops him in the Rear;</L>
<L>Full in his Throat he plung'd the fatal Spear,</L>
<L>That in th' extended Neck a Passage found,</L>
<L>And pierc'd the solid Timber through the Wound.</L>
<L>Fix'd to the reeling Trunk, with many a Stroke</L>
<L>Of his huge Tail, he lash'd the sturdy Oak;</L>
<L>Till spent with Toil, and lab'ring hard for Breath,</L>
<L>He now lay twisting in the Pangs of Death.</L>
<L><HI>Cadmus</HI> beheld him wallow in a Flood</L>
<L>Of swimming Poison, intermix'd with Blood;</L>
<L>When suddenly a Speech was heard from high,</L>
<L>(The Speech was heard, nor was the Speaker nigh)</L>
<L>" Why dost thou thus with secret Pleasure see,</L>
<L>" Insulting Man! what thou thy self shalt be?</L>
<L>Astonish'd at the Voice, he stood amaz'd,</L>
<L>And all around with inward Horror gaz'd:</L>
<L>When <HI>Pallas</HI> swift descending from the Skies,</L>
<L><HI>Pallas,</HI> the Guardian of the Bold and Wise,</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="111"/>
Bids him plow up the Field, and scatter round</L>
<L>The Dragon's Teeth o'er all the furrow'd Ground;</L>
<L>Then tells the Youth how to his wond'ring Eyes</L>
<L>Embattled Armies from the Field should rise.</L>
<L>He sows the Teeth at <HI>Pallas</HI>'s Command,</L>
<L>And flings the future People from his Hand.</L>
<L>The Clods grow warm, and crumble where he sows;</L>
<L>And now the pointed Spears advance in Rows;</L>
<L>Now nodding Plumes appear, and shining Crests,</L>
<L>Now the broad Shoulders and the rising Breasts;</L>
<L>O'er all the Field the breathing Harvest swarms,</L>
<L>A growing Host, a Crop of Men and Arms.</L>
<L>So through the parting Stage a Figure rears</L>
<L>Its Body up, and Limb by Limb appears</L>
<L>By just Degrees; 'till all the Man arise,</L>

<L><HI>Cadmus</HI> surpriz'd, and startled at the Sight</L>

<L>" To mingle in a blind promiscuous War.</L>
<L>This said, he struck his Brother to the Ground,</L>

<L>Nor did the Third his Conquest long survive,</L>

"And e'er to Morrow's Sun begins his Race,</L>

<L>They all consent, and in a chearful Train</L>
<L>The jolly Huntsmen, loaden with the Slain,</L>
<L>Return in Triumph from the sultry Plain.</L>
<L>Down in a Vale with Pine and Cypress clad,</L>
<L>Refresh'd with gentle Winds, and brown with Shade,</L>
<L>The chaste <HI>Diana</HI>'s private Haunt, there stood</L>
<L>Full in the Centre of the darksome Wood</L>
<L>A spacious Grotto, all around o'er-grown</L>
<L>With hoary Moss, and arch'd with Pumice-stone.</L>
<L>From out its rocky Clefts the Waters flow,</L>
<L>And trickling swell into a Lake below.</L>
<L>Nature had ev'ry where so plaid her Part,</L>
<L>That ev'ry where she seem'd to vie with Art.</L>
<L>Here the bright Goddess, toil'd and chaf'd with Heat,</L>
<L>Was wont to bathe her in the cool Retreat.</L>
<L>Here did she now with all her Train resort,</L>
<L>Panting with Heat, and breathless from the Sport;</L>
<L>Her Armour-bearer laid her Bow aside,</L>
<L>Some loos'd her Sandals, some her Veil unty'd;</L>
<L>Each busy Nymph her proper Part undrest;</L>
<L>While <HI>Crocale,</HI> more Handy than the rest,</L>

<L>Bound it together, whilst her own hung loose.</L>

<L>Fetch up the Water, and unlade their Urns.</L>
<L>Now all undrest the shining Goddess stood,</L>
<L>When young <HI>Actaeon,</HI> wilder'd in the Wood,</L>
<L>To the cool Grott by his hard Fate betray'd,</L>
<L>The Fountains fill'd with naked Nymphs survey'd.</L>
<L>The frighted Virgins shrick'd at the Surprize,</L>
<L>(The Forest echo'd with their piercing Cries.)</L>
<L><PB N="81" REF="114"/>
Then in a Huddle round their Goddess prest:</L>
<L>She, proudly eminent above the rest,</L>
<L>With Blushes glow'd; such Blushes as adorn,</L>
<L>The ruddy Welkin, or the purple Morn;</L>
<L>And tho' the crowding Nymphs her Body hide,</L>
<L>Half backward shrunk, and view'd him from aside.</L>
<L>Surpriz'd, at first she would have snatch'd her Bow,</L>
<L>But sees the circling Waters round her flow;</L>
<L>These in the Hollow of her Hand she took,</L>
<L>And dash'd 'em in his Face, while thus she spoke:</L>
<L>" Tell if thou can'st the wond'rous Sight disclos'd,</L>
<L>" A Goddess naked to thy View expos'd.</L>
<L>This said, the Man begun to disappear</L>
<L>By slow Degrees, and ended in a Deer.</L>
<L>A rising Horn on either Brow he wears,</L>
<L>And stretches out his Neck, and pricks his Ears;</L>
<L>Rough is his Skin, with sudden Hairs o'er-grown,</L>
<L>His Bosom pants with Fears before unknown.</L>
<L>Transform'd at length, he flies away in haste,</L>

<L>But as by Chance, within a neighb'ring Brook,</L>
<L>He saw his branching Horns and alter'd Look,</L>
<L>Wretched <HI>Actaeon!</HI> in a doleful Tone</L>
<L>He try'd to speak, but only gave a Groan;</L>
<L>And as he wept, within the watry Glass</L>
<L>He saw the big round Drops, with silent Pace,</L>
<L>Run trickling down a savage hairy Face.</L>
<L>What should he do? Or seek his old Abodes,</L>
<L>Or herd among the Deer, and sculk in Woods?</L>
<L>Here Shame dissuades him, there his Fear prevails,</L>
<L>And each by turns his aking Heart assails.</L>

As he thus ponders, he behind him spies</L>
<L>His op'ning Hounds, and now he hears their Cries:</L>
<L>A gen'rous Pack, or to maintain the Chace,</L>
<L>Or snuff the Vapour from the scented Grass.</L>
<L>He bounded off with Fear, and swiftly ran</L>
<L>O'er craggy Mountains, and the flow'ry Plain;</L>
<L>Through Brakes and Thickets forc'd his Way, and flew</L>
<L>Through many a Ring, where once he did pursue.</L>
<L>In vain he oft endeavour'd to proclaim</L>
<L>His new Misfortune, and to tell his Name;</L>
<L>Nor Voice nor Words the brutal Tongue supplies;</L>
<L>From shouting Men, and Horns, and Dogs he flies,</L>
<L>Deafen'd and stunn'd with their promiscuous Cries.</L>

<L>Close at his Heels, and sprung before the rest,</L>
<L>Had fasten'd on him, straight another Pair</L>
<L>Hung on his wounded Haunch, and held him there,</L>
<L>'Till all the Pack came up, and ev'ry Hound</L>
<L>Tore the sad Huntsman grov'ling on the Ground,</L>
<L>Who now appear'd but one continu'd Wound.</L>
<L>With dropping Tears his bitter Fate he moans,</L>
<L>And fills the Mountain with his dying Groans.</L>
<L>His Servants with a piteous Look he spies,</L>
<L>And turns about his supplicating Eyes.</L>
<L>His Servants, ignorant of what had chanc'd,</L>
<L>With eager Haste and joyful Shouts advanc'd,</L>

<HEAD>The Story of PYRAMUS and THISBE.</HEAD>
<L>In <HI>Babylon,</HI> where first her Queen, for State</L>
<L>Rais'd Walls of Brick magnificently great,</L>
<L>Liv'd <HI>Pyramus,</HI> and <HI>Thisbe,</HI> lovely Pair!</L>
<L>He found no Eastern Youth his Equal there,</L>
<L>And she beyond the fairest Nymph was fair.</L>
<L>A closer Neighbourhood was never known,</L>
<L>Tho' two the Houses, yet the Roof was one.</L>
<L>Acquaintance grew, th' Acquaintance they improve</L>
<L>To Friendship, Friendship ripen'd into Love:</L>
<L>Love had been crown'd, but impotently mad,</L>
<L>What Parents could not hinder, they forbad.</L>
<L>For with fierce Flames young <HI>Pyramus</HI> still burn'd,</L>
<L>And grateful <HI>Thisbe</HI> Flames as fierce return'd.</L>
<L>Aloud in Words their Thoughts they dare not break,</L>
<L>But silent stand, and silent Looks can speak.</L>
<L>The Fire of Love the more it is supprest,</L>
<L>The more it glows, and rages in the Breast.</L>
<L>When the Division-wall was built, a Chink</L>
<L>Was left, the Cement unobserv'd to shrink.</L>
<L>So slight the Cranny, that it still had been</L>
<L>For Centuries unclos'd, because unseen.</L>
<L>But oh! what thing so small, so secret lies,</L>
<L>Which scapes, if form'd for Love, a Lover's Eyes?</L>
<L>Ev'n in this narrow Chink they quickly found</L>
<L>A friendly Passage for a trackless Sound.</L>
<L><PB N="105" REF="139"/>
Safely they told their Sorrows, and their Joys</L>
<L>In whisper'd Murmurs, and a dying Noise.</L>
<L>By turns to catch each other's Breath they strove,</L>
<L>And suck'd in all the balmy Breeze of Love.</L>
<L>Oft as on diff'rent Sides they stood, they cry'd,</L>
<L>Malicious Wall, thus Lovers to divide!</L>
<L>Suppose, thou should'st awhile to us give Place</L>
<L>To lock, and fasten in a close Embrace:</L>
<L>But if too much to grant so sweet a Bliss,</L>
<L>Indulge at least the Pleasure of a Kiss.</L>
<L>We scorn Ingratitude: To thee, we know,</L>
<L>This safe Conveyance of our Minds we owe.</L>
<L>Thus they their vain Petition did renew</L>
<L>Till Night, and then they softly sigh'd Adieu.</L>
<L>But first they strove to kiss, and that was all;</L>
<L>Their Kisses dy'd untasted on the Wall.</L>
<L>Soon as the Morn had o'er the Stars prevail'd,</L>
<L>And warn'd by <HI>Phoebus,</HI> Flow'rs their Dews exhal'd,</L>
<L>The Lovers to their well-known Place return,</L>
<L>Alike they suffer, and alike they mourn.</L>
<L>At last their Parents they resolve to cheat,</L>
<L>(If to deceive in Love be call'd Deceit)</L>
<L>To steal by Night from home, and thence unknown</L>
<L>To seek the Fields, and quit th' unfaithful Town.</L>
<L>But to prevent their wand'ring in the Dark,</L>
<L>They both agree to fix upon a Mark;</L>
<L>A Mark, that could not their Designs expose:</L>
<L>The Tomb of <HI>Ninus</HI> was the Mark they chose.</L>
<L>There they might rest secure beneath the Shade,</L>
<L>Which Boughs, with snowy Fruit encumber'd, made:</L>
<L>A wide-spread Mulberry its Rise had took</L>
<L>Just on the Margin of a gurgling Brook.</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="140"/>
Impatient for the friendly Dusk they stay;</L>
<L>And chide the Slowness of departing Day;</L>
<L>In Western Seas down sunk at last the Light,</L>
<L>From Western Seas up-rose the Shades of Night.</L>
<L>The loving <HI>Thisbe</HI> ev'n prevents the Hour,</L>
<L>With cautious Silence she unlocks the Door,</L>
<L>And veils her Face, and marching thro' the Gloom</L>
<L>Swiftly arrives at th' Assignation-Tomb.</L>
<L>For still the fearful Sex can fearless prove;</L>
<L>Boldly they act, if spirited by Love.</L>
<L>When lo! a Lioness rush'd o'er the Plain,</L>
<L>Grimly besmear'd with Blood of Oxen slain;</L>
<L>And what to the dire Sight new Horrors brought,</L>
<L>To slake her Thirst the neighb'ring Spring she sought</L>
<L>Which, by the Moon, when trembling <HI>Thisbe</HI> spies,</L>
<L>Wing'd with her Fear, swift, as the Wind, she flies;</L>
<L>And in a Cave recovers from her Fright,</L>
<L>But drop'd her Veil, confounded in her Flight.</L>
<L>When sated with repeated Draughts, again</L>
<L>The Queen of Beasts scour'd back along the Plain,</L>
<L>She found the Veil, and mouthing it all o'er,</L>
<L>With bloody Jaws the lifeless Prey she tore.</L>
<L>The Youth, who could not cheat his Guards so soon,</L>
<L>Late came, and noted by the glimm'ring Moon</L>
<L>Some savage Feet, new printed on the Ground,</L>
<L>His Cheeks turn'd pale, his Limbs no Vigour found:</L>
<L>But, when advancing on, the Veil he spied</L>
<L>Distain'd with Blood, and ghastly torn, he cried,</L>
<L>One Night shall Death to two young Lovers give,</L>
<L>But she deserv'd unnumber'd Years to live!</L>
<L>'Tis I am guilty, I have thee betray'd,</L>
<L>Who came not early, as my charming Maid.</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="141"/>
Whatever slew thee, I the Cause remain,</L>
<L>I nam'd, and fix'd the Place, where thou wast slain.</L>
<L>Ye Lions from your neighb'ring Dens repair,</L>
<L>Pity the Wretch, this impious Body tear!</L>
<L>But Cowards thus for Death can idly crie;</L>
<L>The Brave still have it in their Pow'r to die.</L>
<L>Then to th'appointed Tree he hastes away,</L>
<L>The Veil first gather'd, tho' all rent it lay:</L>
<L>The Veil all rent, yet still itself endears,</L>
<L>He kist, and kissing, wash'd it with his Tears.</L>
<L>Tho' rich (he cry'd) with many a precious Stain,</L>
<L>Still from my Blood a deeper Tincture gain.</L>
<L>Then in his Breast his shining Sword he drown'd,</L>
<L>And fell supine, extended on the Ground.</L>
<L>As out again the Blade he, dying, drew,</L>
<L>Out spun the Blood, and streaming upwards flew.</L>
<L>So if a Conduit-pipe e'er burst you saw,</L>
<L>Swift spring the gushing Waters thro' the Flaw:</L>
<L>Then spouting in a Bow, they rise on high,</L>
<L>And a new Fountain plays amid the Sky.</L>
<L>The Berries, stain'd with Blood, began to show</L>
<L>A dark Complexion, and forgot their Snow;</L>
<L>While fatten'd with the flowing Gore, the Root</L>
<L>Was doom'd for ever to a purple Fruit.</L>
<L>Mean time poor <HI>Thisbe</HI> fear'd, so long she stay'd,</L>
<L>Her Lover might suspect a perjur'd Maid.</L>
<L>Her Fright scarce o'er, she strove the Youth to find</L>
<L>With ardent Eyes, which spoke an ardent Mind.</L>
<L>Already in his Arms, she hears him sigh</L>
<L>At her Destruction, which was once so nigh.</L>
<L>The Tomb, the Tree, but not the Fruit she knew,</L>
<L>The Fruit she doubted for its alter'd Hue.</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="142"/>
Still as she doubts, her Eyes a Body found</L>
<L>Quiv'ring in Death, and gasping on the Ground.</L>
<L>She started back, the Red her Cheeks forsook,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Nerve with thrilling Horrors shook.</L>
<L>So trembles the smooth Surface of the Seas,</L>
<L>If brush'd o'er gently with a rising Breeze.</L>
<L>But when her View her bleeding Love confest,</L>
<L>She shriek'd, she tore her Hair, she beat her Breast.</L>
<L>She rais'd the Body, and embrac'd it round,</L>
<L>And bath'd with Tears unfeign'd the gaping Wound.</L>
<L>Then her warm Lips to the cold Face apply'd,</L>
<L>And is it thus, ah! thus we meet, she cry'd!</L>
<L>My <HI>Pyramus!</HI> whence sprung thy cruel Fate?</L>
<L>My <HI>Pyramus!—</HI> ah! speak, e'er 'tis too late.</L>
<L>I, thy own <HI>Thisbe,</HI> but one Word implore,</L>
<L>One Word thy <HI>Thisbe</HI> never ask'd before.</L>
<L>At <HI>Thisbe</HI>'s Name, awak'd, he open'd wide</L>
<L>His dying Eyes; with dying Eyes he try'd</L>
<L>On her to dwell, but clos'd them slow, and dy'd.</L>
<L>The fatal Cause was now at last explor'd,</L>
<L>Her Veil she knew, and saw his sheathless Sword:</L>
<L>From thy own Hand thy Ruin thou hast found,</L>
<L>She said, but Love first taught that Hand to wound.</L>
<L>Ev'n I for thee as bold a Hand can show,</L>
<L>And Love, which shall as true direct the Blow.</L>
<L>I will against the Woman's Weakness strive,</L>
<L>And never thee, lamented Youth, survive.</L>
<L>The World may say, I caus'd, alas! thy Death,</L>
<L>But saw thee breathless, and resign'd my Breath.</L>
<L>Fate, tho' it conquers, shall no Triumph gain,</L>
<L>Fate, that divides us, still divides in vain.</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="143"/>
Now, both our cruel Parents, hear my Pray'r,</L>
<L>My Pray'r to offer for us both I dare:</L>
<L>Oh! see our Ashes in one Urn confin'd,</L>
<L>Whom Love at first, and Fate at last has joyn'd.</L>
<L>The Bliss, you envy'd, is not our Request;</L>
<L>Lovers, when dead, may sure together rest.</L>
<L>Thou, Tree, where now one lifeless Lump is laid,</L>
<L>E'er long o'er two shalt cast a friendly Shade.</L>
<L>Still let our Loves from thee be understood,</L>
<L>Still witness in thy purple Fruit our Blood.</L>
<L>She spoke, and in her Bosom plung'd the Sword,</L>
<L>All warm and reeking from it's slaughter'd Lord.</L>
<L>The Pray'r, which dying <HI>Thisbe</HI> had preferr'd,</L>
<L>Both Gods, and Parents with Compassion heard.</L>
<L>The Whiteness of the Mulberry soon fled,</L>
<L>And rip'ning, sadden'd in a dusky Red:</L>
<L>While both their Parents their lost Children mourn,</L>
<L>And mix their Ashes in one golden Urn.</L>
<L>Thus did the melancholy Tale conclude,</L>
<L>And a short, silent Interval ensu'd.</L>
<L>The next in Birth unloos'd her artful Tongue,</L>
<L>And drew attentive all the Sister-Throng.</L>

<L>How <HI>Salmacis,</HI> with weak enfeebling Streams</L>
<L>Softens the Body, and unnerves the Limbs,</L>
<L>And what the secret Cause, shall here be shown;</L>
<L>The Cause is secret, but th' Effect is known.</L>
<L>The <HI>Naïds</HI> nurst an Infant heretofore,</L>
<L>That <HI>Cytherea</HI> once to <HI>Hermes</HI> bore:</L>
<L>From both th' Illustrious Authors of his Race</L>
<L>The Child was nam'd; nor was it hard to trace</L>
<L>Both the bright Parents thro' the Infant's Face.</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="150"/>
When fifteen Years, in <HI>Ida</HI>'s cool Retreat,</L>
<L>The Boy had told, he left his Native Seat,</L>
<L>And sought fresh Fountains in a foreign Soil:</L>
<L>The Pleasure lessen'd the attending Toil.</L>
<L>With eager Steps the <HI>Lycian</HI> Fields he crost,</L>
<L>And Fields that border on the <HI>Lycian</HI> Coast;</L>
<L>A River here he view'd so lovely bright,</L>
<L>It shew'd the Bottom in a fairer Light,</L>
<L>Nor kept a Sand conceal'd from Human sight.</L>
<L>The Stream produc'd nor slimy Ooze, nor Weeds,</L>
<L>Nor miry Rushes, nor the spiky Reeds;</L>
<L>But dealt enriching Moisture all around,</L>
<L>The fruitful Banks with chearful Verdure crown'd,</L>
<L>And kept the Spring Eternal on the Ground.</L>
<L>A Nymph presides, nor practis'd in the Chace,</L>
<L>Nor skilful at the Bow, nor at the Race;</L>
<L>Of all the Blue-ey'd Daughters of the Main,</L>
<L>The only Stranger to <HI>Diana</HI>'s Train:</L>
<L>Her Sisters often, as 'tis said, wou'd cry</L>
<L>" Fie <HI>Salmacis,</HI> what always idle! fie,</L>
<L>" Or take thy Quiver, or thy Arrows seize,</L>
<L>" And mix the Toils of Hunting with thy Ease.</L>
<L>Nor Quiver she nor Arrows e'er wou'd seize,</L>
<L>Nor mix the Toils of Hunting with her Ease.</L>
<L>But oft would bathe her in the Chrystal Tide,</L>
<L>Oft with a Comb her dewy Locks divide;</L>
<L>Now in the limpid Streams she views her Face,</L>
<L>And drest her Image in the floating Glass:</L>
<L>On Beds of Leaves she now repos'd her Limbs,</L>
<L>Now gather'd Flow'rs that grew about her Stream</L>
<L>And then by chance was gathering, as she stood</L>
<L>To view the Boy, and long'd for what she view'd.</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="151"/>
Fain wou'd she meet the Youth with hasty Feet,</L>
<L>She fain wou'd meet him, but refus'd to meet</L>
<L>Before her Looks were set with nicest Care,</L>
<L>And well deserv'd to be reputed Fair.</L>
<L>" Bright Youth, she cries, whom all thy Features prove</L>
<L>" A God, and, if a God, the God of Love;</L>
<L>" But if a Mortal, blest thy Nurse's Breast,</L>
<L>" Blest are thy Parents, and thy Sisters blest:</L>
<L>" But oh how blest! how more than blest thy Bride.</L>
<L>" Ally'd in Bliss, if any yet ally'd.</L>
<L>" If so, let mine the stoln Enjoyments be;</L>
<L>" If not, behold a willing Bride in me.</L>
<L>The Boy knew nought of Love, and toucht with Shame,</L>
<L>He strove, and blusht, but still the Blush became:</L>
<L>In rising Blushes still fresh Beauties rose;</L>
<L>The sunny Side of Fruit such Blushes shows,</L>
<L>And such the Moon, when all her Silver White</L>
<L>Turns in Eclipses to a ruddy Light.</L>
<L>The Nymph still begs, if not a nobler Bliss,</L>
<L>A cold Salute at least, a Sister's Kiss:</L>
<L>And now prepares to take the lovely Boy</L>
<L>Between her Arms. He, innocently coy,</L>
<L>Replies, " Or leave me to my self alone,</L>
<L>" You rude uncivil Nymph, or I'll be gone.</L>
<L>" Fair Stranger then, says she, it shall be so;</L>
<L>And, for she fear'd his Threats, she feign'd to go:</L>
<L>But hid within a Covert's neighbouring Green,</L>
<L>She kept him still in sight, herself unseen.</L>
<L>The Boy now fancies all the Danger o'er,</L>
<L>And innocently sports about the Shore,</L>
<L>Playsul and wanton to the Stream he trips,</L>
<L>And dips his Foot, and shivers, as he dips.</L>
<L><PB N="118" REF="152"/>
The Coolness pleas'd him, and with eager haste</L>
<L>His airy Garments on the Banks he cast;</L>
<L>His Godlike Features, and his Heav'nly Hue,</L>
<L>And all his Beauties were expos'd to View.</L>
<L>His naked Limbs the Nymph with Rapture spies,</L>
<L>While hotter Passions in her Bosom rise,</L>
<L>Flush in her Cheeks, and sparkle in her Eyes.</L>
<L>She longs, she burns to clasp him in her Arms,</L>
<L>And looks, and sighs, and kindles at his Charms.</L>
<L>Now all undrest upon the Banks he stood,</L>
<L>And clapt his Sides, and leapt into the Flood:</L>
<L>His lovely Limbs the Silver Waves divide,</L>
<L>His Limbs appear more lovely through the Tide;</L>
<L>As Lilies shut within a Chrystal Case,</L>
<L>Receive a glossy Lustre from the Glass.</L>
<L>He's mine, he's all my own, the <HI>Naïd</HI> cries,</L>
<L>And flings off all, and after him she flies.</L>
<L>And now she fastens on him as he swims,</L>
<L>And holds him close, and wraps about his Limbs.</L>
<L>The more the Boy resisted, and was coy,</L>
<L>The more she clipt, and kist the strugling Boy.</L>
<L>So when the wrigling Snake is snacht on high</L>
<L>In <HI>Eagle</HI>'s Claws, and hisses in the Sky,</L>
<L>Around the Foe his twirling Tail he flings,</L>
<L>And twists her Legs, and wriths about her Wings.</L>
<L>The restless Boy still obstinately strove</L>
<L>To free himself, and still refus'd her Love.</L>
<L>Amidst his Limbs she kept her Limbs intwin'd,</L>
<L>" And why, coy Youth, she cries, why thus unkind!</L>
<L>" Oh may the Gods thus keep us ever join'd!</L>
<L>" Oh may we never, never part again!</L>
<L>So pray'd the Nymph, nor did she pray in vain:</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="153"/>
For now she finds him, as his Limbs she prest,</L>
<L>Grow nearer still, and nearer to her Breast;</L>
<L>Till, piercing each the other's Flesh, they run</L>
<L>Together, and incorporate in One:</L>
<L>Last in one Face are both their Faces join'd,</L>
<L>As when the Stock and grafted Twig combin'd</L>
<L>Shoot up the same, and wear a common Rind:</L>
<L>Both Bodies in a single Body mix,</L>
<L>A single Body with a double Sex.</L>
<L>The Boy, thus lost in Woman, now survey'd</L>
<L>The River's guilty Stream, and thus he pray'd.</L>
<L>(He pray'd, but wonder'd at his softer Tone,</L>
<L>Surpriz'd to hear a Voice but half his own)</L>
<L>You Parent-Gods, whose Heav'nly Names I bear,</L>
<L>Hear your <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI> and grant my Pray'r;</L>
<L>Oh grant, that whomsoe'er these Streams contain,</L>
<L>If Man he enter'd, he may rise again</L>
<L>Supple, unsinew'd, and but half a Man!</L>
<L>The Heav'nly Parents answer'd, from on high,</L>

<L>The bashful Goddess turn'd her Eyes away,</L>
<L>Nor durst such bold Impurity survey;</L>
<L>But on the ravish'd Virgin Vengeance takes,</L>
<L>Her shining Hair is chang'd to hissing Snakes.</L>
<L>These in her <HI>Aegis Pallas</HI> joys to bear,</L>
<L>The hissing Snakes her Foes more sure ensnare,</L>
<L>Than they did Lovers once, when shining Hair.</L>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HILE <HI>Perseus</HI> entertain'd with this Report</L>
<L>His Father <HI>Cepheus,</HI> and the list'ning Court,</L>
<L>Within the Palace Walls was heard aloud</L>
<L>The roaring Noise of some unruly Crowd;</L>
<L>Not like the Songs which chearful Friends prepare</L>
<L>For nuptial Days, but Sounds that threaten'd War;</L>
<L>And all the Pleasures of this happy Feast,</L>
<L>To Tumult turn'd, in wild Disorder ceas'd:</L>
<L>So, when the Sea is calm, we often find</L>
<L>A Storm rais'd sudden by some furious Wind.</L>
<L>Chief in the Riot <HI>Phineus</HI> first appear'd,</L>
<L>The rash Ringleader of this boist'rous Herd,</L>
<L>And brandishing his brazen-pointed Lance,</L>
<L>Behold, he said, an injur'd Man advance,</L>
<L><PB N="142" REF="176"/>
Stung with Resentment for his ravish'd Wife,</L>
<L>Nor shall thy Wings, O <HI>Perseus,</HI> save thy Life;</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Jove</HI> himself; tho' we've been often told</L>
<L>Who got thee in the Form of tempting Gold.</L>
<L>His Lance was aim'd, when <HI>Cepheus</HI> ran, and said,</L>
<L>Hold, Brother, hold; what brutal Rage has made</L>
<L>Your frantick Mind so black a Crime conceive?</L>
<L>Are these the Thanks that you to <HI>Perseus</HI> give?</L>
<L>This the Reward that to his Worth you pay,</L>
<L>Whose timely Valour sav'd <HI>Andromeda?</HI></L>
<L>Nor was it he, if you would reason right,</L>
<L>That forc'd her from you, but the jealous Spight</L>
<L>Of envious <HI>Nereids,</HI> and <HI>Jove</HI>'s high Decree;</L>
<L>And that devouring Monster of the Sea,</L>
<L>That ready with his Jaws wide-gaping stood</L>
<L>To eat my Child, the fairest of my Blood.</L>
<L>You lost her then, when she seem'd past Relief,</L>
<L>And wish'd perhaps her Death, to ease your Grief</L>
<L>With my Afflictions: Not content to view</L>
<L><HI>Andromeda</HI> in Chains, unhelp'd by you,</L>
<L>Her Spouse and Uncle; will you grieve that he
Expos'd his Life the dying Maid to free?</L>
<L>And shall you claim his Merit? Had you thought</L>
<L>Her Charms so great, you shou'd have bravely sought</L>
<L>That Blessing on the Rocks, where fix'd she lay:</L>
<L>But now let <HI>Perseus</HI> bear his Prize away,</L>
<L>By Service gain'd, by promis'd Faith possess'd;</L>
<L>To him I owe it, that my Age is bless'd</L>
<L>Still with a Child: Nor think that I prefer</L>
<L><HI>Perseus</HI> to thee, but to the Loss of her.</L>
<L><HI>Phineus</HI> on him, and <HI>Perseus</HI> roul'd about</L>
<L>His Eyes in silent Rage, and seem'd to doubt</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="177"/>
Which to destroy; till, resolute at length,</L>
<L>He threw his Spear with the redoubled Strength</L>
<L>His Fury gave him, and at <HI>Perseus</HI> struck;</L>
<L>But missing <HI>Perseus,</HI> in his Seat it stuck.</L>
<L>Who, springing nimbly up, return'd the Dart,</L>
<L>And almost plung'd it in his Rival's Heart;</L>
<L>But he, for Safety, to the Altar ran,</L>
<L>Unfit Protection for so vile a Man;</L>
<L>Yet was the Stroke not vain, as <HI>Rhaetus</HI> found,</L>
<L>Who in his Brow receiv'd a mortal Wound;</L>
<L>Headlong he tumbled, when his Skull was broke,</L>
<L>From which his Friends the fatal Weapon took,</L>
<L>While he lay trembling, and his gushing Blood</L>
<L>In crimson Streams around the Table flow'd.</L>
<L>But this provok'd th' unruly Rabble worse,</L>
<L>They flung their Darts, and some in loud Discourse</L>
<L>To Death young <HI>Perseus</HI> and the Monarch doom;</L>
<L>But <HI>Cepheus</HI> left before the guilty Room,</L>
<L>With Grief appealing to the Gods above,</L>
<L>Who Laws of Hospitality approve,</L>
<L>Who Faith protect, and succour injur'd Right,</L>
<L>That he was guiltless of this barb'rous Fight.</L>
<L><HI>Pallas</HI> her Brother <HI>Perseus</HI> close attends,</L>
<L>And with her ample Shield from Harm defends,</L>
<L>Raising a sprightly Courage in his Heart;</L>
<L>But <HI>Indian Athis</HI> took the weaker Part,</L>
<L>Born in the chrystal Grottoes of the Sea,</L>
<L><HI>Limnatè</HI>'s Son, a Fenny Nymph, and she</L>
<L>Daughter of <HI>Ganges</HI>; Graceful was his Mein,</L>
<L>His Person lovely, and his Age Sixteen.</L>
<L>His Habit made his native Beauty more;</L>
<L>A purple Mantle fring'd with Gold he wore;</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="178"/>
His Neck well-turn'd with golden Chains was grac'd,</L>
<L>His Hair with Myrrh perfum'd, was nicely dress'd.</L>
<L>Tho' with just Aim he cou'd the Javelin throw,</L>
<L>Yet with more Skill he drew the bending Bow;</L>
<L>And now was drawing it with artful Hand,</L>
<L>When <HI>Perseus</HI> snatching up a flaming Brand,</L>
<L>Whirl'd sudden at his Face the burning Wood,</L>
<L>Crush'd his Eyes in, and quench'd the Fire with Blood;</L>
<L>Thro' the soft Skin the splinter'd Bones appear,</L>
<L>And spoil'd the Face that lately was so fair.</L>
<L>When <HI>Lycabas</HI> his <HI>Athis</HI> thus beheld,</L>
<L>How was his Heart with friendly Horror fill'd?</L>
<L>A Youth so noble, to his Soul so dear,</L>
<L>To see his shapeless Look, his dying Groans to hear!</L>
<L>He snatch'd the Bow the Boy was us'd to bend,</L>
<L>And cry'd, With me, false Traytor, dare contend;</L>
<L>Boast not a Conquest o'er a Child, but try</L>
<L>Thy Strength with me, who all thy Pow'rs defy;</L>
<L>Nor think so mean an Act a Victory.</L>
<L>While yet he spoke he flung the whizzing Dart,</L>
<L>Which pierc'd the plaited Robe, but miss'd his Heart:</L>
<L><HI>Perseus</HI> defy'd, upon him fiercely press'd</L>
<L>With Sword unsheath'd, and plung'd it in his Breast;</L>
<L>His Eyes o'erwhelm'd with Night, he stumbling falls,</L>
<L>And with his latest Breath on <HI>Athis</HI> calls;</L>
<L>Pleas'd that so near the lovely Youth he lies,</L>
<L>He sinks his Head upon his Friend, and dies.</L>
<L>Next eager <HI>Phorbas,</HI> old <HI>Methion</HI>'s Son,</L>
<L>Came rushing forward with <HI>Amphimedon</HI>;</L>
<L>When the smooth Pavement, slippery made with Gore,</L>
<L>Trip'd up their Feet, and flung 'em on the Floor;</L>
<L><PB N="145" REF="179"/>
The Sword of <HI>Perseus,</HI> who by chance was nigh,</L>
<L>Prevents their Rise, and where they fall they lye:</L>
<L>Full in his Ribs <HI>Amphimedon</HI> he smote,</L>
<L>And then stuck fiery <HI>Phorbas</HI> in the Throat.</L>
<L><HI>Eurythus</HI> lifting up his Ax, the Blow</L>
<L>Was thus prevented by his nimble Foe;</L>
<L>A golden Cup he seizes, high embost,</L>
<L>And at his Head the massy Goblet tost:</L>
<L>It hits, and from his Forehead bruis'd rebounds,</L>
<L>And Blood and Brains he vomits from his Wounds;</L>
<L>With his slain Fellows on the Floor he lies,</L>
<L>And Death for ever shuts his swimming Eyes.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Polydaemon</HI> fell, a Goddess-born;</L>
<L><HI>Phlegias,</HI> and <HI>Elycen</HI> with Locks unshorn</L>
<L>Next follow'd; next, the Stroke of Death he gave</L>
<L>To <HI>Clytus, Abanis,</HI> and <HI>Lycetus</HI> brave;</L>
<L>While o'er unnumber'd Heaps of ghastly Dead,</L>
<L>The <HI>Argive</HI> Heroe's Feet triumphant tread.</L>
<L>But <HI>Phineus</HI> stands aloof, and dreads to feel</L>
<L>His Rival's Force, and flies his pointed Steel:</L>
<L>Yet threw a Dart from far; by chance it lights</L>
<L>On <HI>Idas,</HI> who for neither Party fights;</L>
<L>But wounded, sternly thus to <HI>Phineus</HI> said,</L>
<L>Since of a Neuter thou a Foe hast made,</L>
<L>This I return thee, drawing from his Side</L>
<L>The Dart; which, as he strove to fling, he dy'd.</L>
<L><HI>Odites</HI> fell by <HI>Clymenus</HI>'s Sword,</L>
<L>The <HI>Cephen</HI> Court had not a greater Lord.</L>
<L><HI>Hypseus</HI> his Blade does in <HI>Protenor</HI> sheath,</L>
<L>But brave <HI>Lyncides</HI> soon reveng'd his Death.</L>
<L>Here too was old <HI>Emathion,</HI> one that fear'd</L>
<L>The Gods, and in the Cause of Heav'n appear'd,</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="180"/>
Who only wishing the Success of Right,</L>
<L>And, by his Age, exempted from the Fight,</L>
<L>Both Sides alike condemns; This impious War</L>
<L>Cease, cease, he cries; these bloody Broils forbear.</L>
<L>This scarce the Sage with high Concern had said,</L>
<L>When <HI>Chromis</HI> at a Blow struck off his Head,</L>
<L>Which dropping, on the royal Altar roul'd,</L>
<L>Still staring on the Crowd with Aspect bold;</L>
<L>And still it seem'd their horrid Strife to blame,</L>
<L>In Life and Death his pious Zeal the same;</L>
<L>While, clinging to the Horns, the Trunk expires,</L>
<L>The sever'd Head consumes amidst the Fires.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Phineus,</HI> who from far his Javelin threw,</L>
<L><HI>Broteas</HI> and <HI>Ammon,</HI> Twins and Brothers, slew;</L>
<L>For knotted Gauntlets matchless in the Field;</L>
<L>But Gauntlets must to Swords and Javelins yield.</L>
<L><HI>Ampycus</HI> next, with hallow'd Fillets bound,</L>
<L>As <HI>Ceres</HI>' Priest, and with a Mitre crown'd,</L>
<L>His Spear transfix'd, and struck him to the Ground.</L>
<L>O, <HI>läpetides,</HI> with Pain I tell</L>
<L>How you, sweet Lyrist, in the Riot fell;</L>
<L>What worse than brutal Rage his Breast could fill,</L>
<L>Who did thy Blood, O Bard Celestial, spill?</L>
<L>Kindly you press'd amid the Princely Throng,</L>
<L>To crown the Feast, and give the Nuptial Song:</L>
<L>Discord abhorr'd the Musick of thy Lyre,</L>
<L>Whose Notes did gentle Peace so well inspire;</L>
<L>Thee, when fierce <HI>Pettalus</HI> far off espy'd,</L>
<L>Defenceless with thy Harp, he scoffing cry'd,</L>
<L>Go; to the Ghosts thy soothing Lessons play;</L>
<L>We loath thy Lyre, and scorn thy peaceful Lay:</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="181"/>
And, as again he fiercely bid him go,</L>
<L>He pierc'd his Temples with a mortal Blow.</L>
<L>His Harp he held, tho' sinking on the Ground,</L>
<L>Whose Strings in Death his trembling Fingers found</L>
<L>By chance, and tun'd by chance a dying Sound.</L>
<L>With Grief <HI>Lycormas</HI> saw him fall from far,</L>
<L>And, wresting from the Door a massy Bar,</L>
<L>Full in his Poll lays on a Load of Knocks,</L>
<L>Which stun him, and he falls like a devoted Ox.</L>
<L>Another Bar <HI>Pelates</HI> would have snatch'd,</L>
<L>But <HI>Corythus</HI> his Motions slily watch'd;</L>
<L>He darts his Weapon from a private Stand,</L>
<L>And rivets to the Post his veiny Hand:</L>
<L>When strait a missive Spear transfix'd his Side,</L>
<L>By <HI>Abas</HI> thrown, and as he hung, he dy'd.</L>
<L><HI>Melaneus</HI> on the Prince's Side was slain;</L>
<L>And <HI>Dorylas,</HI> who own'd a fertile Plain,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Nasamonia</HI>'s Fields the wealthy Lord,</L>
<L>Whose crowded Barns could scarce contain their Hoard.</L>
<L>A whizzing Spear obliquely gave a Blow,</L>
<L>Stuck in his Groin, and pierc'd the Nerves below;</L>
<L>His Foe beheld his Eyes convulsive roul,</L>
<L>His ebbing Veins, and his departing Soul;</L>
<L>Then taunting said, Of all thy spacious Plains,</L>
<L>This Spot thy only Property remains.</L>
<L>He left him thus; but had no sooner left,</L>
<L>Than <HI>Perseus</HI> in revenge his Nostrils cleft;</L>
<L>From his Friend's Breast the murd'ring Dart he drew,</L>
<L>And the same Weapon at the Murd'rer threw;</L>
<L>His Head in halves the darted Javelin cut,</L>
<L>And on each Side the Brain came issuing out.</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="182"/>
Fortune his Friend, his Deaths around he deals,</L>
<L>And this his Lance, and that his Faulchion feels:</L>
<L>Now <HI>Clytius</HI> dies; and by a different Wound,</L>
<L>The Twin, his Brother <HI>Clanis,</HI> bites the Ground.</L>
<L>In his rent Jaw the bearded Weapon sticks,</L>
<L>And the steel'd Dart does <HI>Clytius</HI>' Thigh transfix.</L>
<L>With these <HI>Mendesian Celadon</HI> he slew;</L>
<L>And <HI>Astreus</HI> next, whose Mother was a Jew,</L>
<L>His Sire uncertain: Then by <HI>Perseus</HI> fell</L>
<L><HI>Aethion,</HI> who cou'd things to come foretell;</L>
<L>But now he knows not whence the Javelin flies</L>
<L>That wounds his Breast, nor by whose Arm he dies.</L>
<L>The Squire to <HI>Phineus</HI> next his Valour try'd,</L>
<L>And fierce <HI>Agyrtes</HI> stain'd with Parricide.</L>
<L>As these are slain, fresh Numbers still appear,</L>
<L>And wage with <HI>Perseus</HI> an unequal War;</L>
<L>To rob him of his Right, the Maid he won,</L>
<L>By Honour, Promise, and Desert his own.</L>
<L>With him, the Father of the beauteous Bride,</L>
<L>The Mother, and the frighted Virgin side;</L>
<L>With Shrieks and doleful Cries they rend the Air:</L>
<L>Their Shrieks confounded with the Din of War,</L>
<L>With clashing Arms, and Groanings of the Slain,</L>
<L>They grieve unpitied, and unheard complain.</L>
<L>The Floor with ruddy Streams <HI>Bellona</HI> stains,</L>
<L>And <HI>Phineus</HI> a new War with double Rage maintains.</L>
<L><HI>Perseus</HI> begirt, from all around they pour</L>
<L>Their Lances on him, a tempestuous Show'r,</L>
<L>Aim'd all at him; a Cloud of Darts and Spears,</L>
<L>Or blind his Eyes, or whistle round his Ears.</L>
<L>Their Numbers to resist, against the Wall</L>
<L>He guards his Back secure, and dares them all.</L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="183"/>
Here from the Left <HI>Molpeus</HI> renews the Fight,</L>
<L>And bold <HI>Ethemon</HI> presses on the Right:</L>
<L>As when a hungry Tiger near him hears</L>
<L>Two lowing Herds, awhile he both forbears;</L>
<L>Nor can his Hopes of This, or That renounce,</L>
<L>So strong he lusts to prey on both at once;</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Perseus</HI> now with That, or This is loath</L>
<L>To war distinct, but fain wou'd fall on Both.</L>
<L>And first <HI>Chaonian Molpeus</HI> felt his Blow,</L>
<L>And fled, and never after fac'd his Foe;</L>
<L>Then fierce <HI>Ethemon,</HI> as he turn'd his Back,</L>
<L>Hurried with Fury, aiming at his Neck,</L>
<L>His brandish'd Sword against the Marble struck,</L>
<L>With all his Might; the brittle Weapon broke,</L>
<L>And in his Throat the Point rebounding stuck.</L>
<L>Too slight the Wound for Life to issue thence,</L>
<L>And yet too great for Battle, or Defence;</L>
<L>His Arms extended in this piteous State,</L>
<L>For Mercy he wou'd sue, but sues too late;</L>
<L><HI>Perseus</HI> has in his Bosom plung'd the Sword,</L>
<L>And, e're he speaks, the Wound prevents the Word.</L>
<L>The Crowds encreasing, and his Friends distress'd,</L>
<L>Himself by warring Multitudes oppress'd;</L>
<L>Since thus unequally you fight, 'tis time,</L>
<L>He cry'd, to punish your presumptuous Crime;</L>
<L>Beware, my Friends; his Friends were soon prepar'd,</L>
<L>Their Sight averting, high the Head he rear'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Gorgon</HI> on his Foes severely star'd.</L>
<L>Vain Shift! says <HI>Thescelus,</HI> with Aspect bold,</L>
<L>Thee, and thy Bugbear Monster I behold</L>
<L>With Scorn; he lifts his Arm, but e're he threw</L>
<L>The Dart, the Heroe to a Statue grew.</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="184"/>
In the same Posture still the Marble stands,</L>
<L>And holds the Warrior's Weapons in its Hands.</L>
<L><HI>Amphyx,</HI> whom yet this Wonder can't alarm,</L>
<L>Heaves at <HI>Lyncides</HI>' Breast his impious Arm;</L>
<L>But, while thus daringly he presses on,</L>
<L>His Weapon, and his Arm are turn'd to Stone.</L>
<L>Next <HI>Nileus,</HI> he who vainly said he ow'd</L>
<L>His Origin to <HI>Nile</HI>'s prolifick Flood;</L>
<L>Who on his Shield seven silver Rivers bore,</L>
<L>His Birth to witness by the Arms he wore;</L>
<L>Full of his sev'n-fold Father, thus express'd</L>
<L>His Boast to <HI>Perseus,</HI> and his Pride confess'd:</L>
<L>See whence we sprung; Let this thy Comfort be</L>
<L>In thy sure Death, that thou didst die by me.</L>
<L>While yet he spoke, the dying Accents hung</L>
<L>In Sounds imperfect on his Marble Tongue;</L>
<L>Tho' chang'd to Stone, his Lips he seem'd to stretch,</L>
<L>And thro' th'insensate Rock wou'd force a Speech.</L>
<L>This <HI>Eryx</HI> saw, but seeing wou'd not own;</L>
<L>The Mischief by your selves, he cries, is done,</L>
<L>'Tis your cold Courage turns your Hearts to Stone.</L>
<L>Come follow me; fall on the stripling Boy,</L>
<L>Kill him, and you his magick Arms destroy.</L>
<L>Then rushing on, his Arm to strike he rear'd,</L>
<L>And marbled o'er, his varied Frame appear'd.</L>
<L>These for affronting <HI>Pallas</HI> were chastis'd,</L>
<L>And justly met the Death they had despis'd.</L>
<L>But brave <HI>Aconteus, Perseus</HI>' Friend, by chance</L>
<L>Look'd back, and met the <HI>Gorgon</HI>'s fatal Glance:</L>
<L>A Statue now become, he ghastly stares,</L>
<L>And still the Foe to mortal Combat dares;</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="185"/>
<HI>Astyages</HI> the living Likeness knew,</L>
<L>On the dead Stone with vengeful Fury flew;</L>
<L>But impotent his Rage, the jarring Blade</L>
<L>No Print upon the solid Marble made:</L>
<L>Again, as with redoubled Might he struck,</L>
<L>Himself astonish'd in the Quarry stuck.</L>
<L>The vulgar Deaths 'twere tedious to rehearse,</L>
<L>And Fates below the Dignity of Verse;</L>
<L>Their Safety in their Flight Two Hundred found,</L>
<L>Two Hundred, by <HI>Medusa</HI>'s Head were ston'd.</L>
<L>Fierce <HI>Phineus</HI> now repents the wrongful Fight,</L>
<L>And views his varied Friends, a dreadful Sight;</L>
<L>He knows their Faces, for their Help he sues,</L>
<L>And thinks, not hearing him, that they refuse:</L>
<L>By Name he begs their Succour, one by one,</L>
<L>Then doubts their Life, and feels the friendly Stone.</L>
<L>Struck with Remorse, and conscious of his Pride,</L>
<L>Convict of Sin, he turn'd his Eyes aside;</L>
<L>With suppliant Mein to <HI>Perseus</HI> thus he prays,</L>
<L>Hence with the Head, as far as Winds and Seas</L>
<L>Can bear thee; Hence, O quit the <HI>Cephen</HI> Shore,</L>
<L>And never curse us with <HI>Medusa</HI> more,</L>
<L>That horrid Head, which stiffens into Stone</L>
<L>Those impious Men who, daring Death, look on.</L>
<L>I warr'd not with thee out of Hate or Strife,</L>
<L>My honest Cause was to defend my Wife,</L>
<L>First pledg'd to me; What Crime cou'd I suppose,</L>
<L>To arm my Friends, and vindicate my Spouse?</L>
<L>But vain, too late, I soe was our Design;</L>
<L>Mine was the Title, but the Merit thine.</L>
<L>Contending made me guilty, I confess,</L>
<L>But Penitence shou'd make that Guilt the less:</L>
<L><PB N="152" REF="186"/>
'Twas thine to conquer by <HI>Minerva</HI>'s Pow'r;</L>
<L>Favour'd of Heav'n, thy Mercy I implore;</L>
<L>For Life I sue; the rest to thee I yield;</L>
<L>In Pity, from my Sight remove the Shield.</L>
<L>He suing said; nor durst revert his Eyes</L>
<L>On the grim Head: And <HI>Perseus</HI> thus replies;</L>
<L>Coward, what is in me to grant, I will,</L>
<L>Nor Blood, unworthy of my Valour, spill:</L>
<L>Fear not to perish by my vengeful Sword,</L>
<L>From that secure; 'tis all the Fates afford.</L>
<L>Where I now see thee, thou shalt still be seen,</L>
<L>A lasting Monument to please our Queen;</L>
<L>There still shall thy Betroth'd behold her Spouse,</L>
<L>And find his Image in her Father's House.</L>
<L>This said; where <HI>Phineus</HI> turn'd to shun the Shield,</L>
<L>Full in his Face the staring Head he held;</L>
<L>As here, and there he strove to turn aside,</L>
<L>The Wonder wrought, the Man was petrify'd:</L>
<L>All Marble was his Frame; his humid Eyes</L>
<L>Drop'd Tears, which hung upon the Stone like Ice.</L>
<L>In suppliant Posture, with uplifted Hands,</L>
<L>And fearful Look, the guilty Statue stands.</L>
<L>Hence <HI>Perseus</HI> to his native City hies,</L>
<L>Victorious, and rewarded with his Prize.</L>
<L>Conquest, o'er <HI>Praetus</HI> the Usurper, won,</L>
<L>He reinstates his Grandsire in the Throne.</L>
<L><HI>Praetus,</HI> his Brother dispossess'd by Might,</L>
<L>His Realm enjoy'd, and still detain'd his Right:</L>
<L>But <HI>Perseus</HI> pull'd the haughty Tyrant down,</L>
<L>And to the rightful King restor'd the Throne.</L>
<L>Weak was th' Usurper, as his Cause was wrong,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Gorgon</HI>'s Head appears, what Arms are strong?</L>
<L><PB N="153" REF="187"/>
When <HI>Perseus</HI> to his Host the Monster held,</L>
<L>They soon were Statues, and their King expell'd.</L>
<L>Thence, to <HI>Seriphus</HI> with the Head he sails,</L>
<L>Whose Prince his Story treats as idle Tales:</L>
<L>Lord of a little Isle, he scorns to seem</L>
<L>Too credulous, but laughs at That, and Him.</L>
<L>Yet did he not so much suspect the Truth,</L>
<L>As out of Pride or Envy hate the Youth.</L>
<L>The <HI>Argive</HI> Prince, at his Contempt enrag'd,</L>
<L>To force his Faith by fatal Proof engag'd.</L>
<L>Friends, shut your Eyes, he cries; his Shield he takes,</L>

Once, I remember, in the Summer's Heat,</L>
<L>Tir'd with the Chase, I sought a cool Retreat;</L>
<L>And, walking on, a silent Current found,</L>

And, as fierce Hawks the trembling Doves pursue,</L>

<L>And soon had <HI>Psophis</HI> and <HI>Cyllene</HI> in Sight;</L>

<L>Unweary'd I till now o'er Hills and Plains,</L>

<L>Often upon the Bank their Station take,</L>

<L>Still, void of Shame, they lead a clam'rous Life,</L>
<L>And, croaking, still scold on in endless Strife;</L>
<L>Compell'd to live beneath the liquid Stream,</L>
<L>Where still they quarrel, and attempt to skream.</L>
<L>Now, from their bloated Throat, their Voice puts on</L>
<L>Imperfect Murmurs in a hoarser Tone;</L>
<L>Their noisy Jaws, with Bawling now grown wide,</L>

<L>Whom nor a Parent's strict Commands could move,</L>

<L>Now, with Remorse his Conscience deeply stung,</L>

<L>Tears, unavailing, but defer our Time,</L>
<L>The stabbing Sword must expiate the Crime;</L>

<L>A Weapon more tormenting can invent.</L>
<L>O Sister! I've prepar'd my stubborn Heart,</L>
<L>To act some hellish, and unheard-of Part;</L>
<L>Either the Palace to surround with Fire,</L>

Then her tempestuous Anger was allay'd,</L>

What unseen Pow'r does this Disorder move?</L>

<L>To me too hard?—But so indeed they are.</L>
<L>Why shou'd I for a Stranger fear, lest he</L>
<L>Shou'd perish, whom I did but lately see?</L>
<L>His Death, or Safety, what are they to me?</L>
<L>Wretch, from thy Virgin-Breast this Flame expel,</L>

<L>Discretion this, Affection that perswades.</L>
<L>I see the Right, and I approve it too,</L>

<L>Why, Royal Maid, shou'dst thou desire to wed</L>
<L>A Wanderer, and court a foreign Bed?</L>
<L>Thy native Land, tho' barb'rous, can present</L>
<L>A Bridegroom worth a Royal Bride's Consent:</L>

<L>His Earth-born Foes to fiercer Fury move,</L>

<L>The Gods forbid—But Pray'rs are idle Breath,</L>
<L>When Action only can prevent his Death.</L>
<L>Shall I betray my Father and the State,</L>

<L>But no such Symptom in his Looks I read.</L>
<L>Nature wou'd ne'er have lavish'd so much Grace</L>

<HEAD>The Story of Ants chang'd to Men.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. STONESTREET.</BYLINE>
<L>A dreadful Plague from angry <HI>Juno</HI> came,</L>
<L>To scourge the Land that bore her Rival's Name;</L>
<L>Before her fatal Anger was reveal'd,</L>
<L>And teeming Malice lay as yet conceal'd,</L>
<L>All Remedies we try, all Med'cines use,</L>
<L>Which Nature cou'd supply, or Art produce;</L>
<L>Th' unconquer'd Foe derides the vain Design,</L>
<L>And Art and Nature foil'd, declare the Cause Divine.</L>
<L>At first we only felt th' oppressive Weight</L>
<L>Of gloomy Clouds, then teeming with our Fate,</L>
<L>And lab'ring to discharge unactive Heat:</L>
<L><PB N="239" REF="276"/>
But e're four Moons alternate Changes knew,</L>
<L>With deadly Blasts the fatal <HI>South-wind</HI> blew,</L>
<L>Infected all the Air, and poison'd as it flew.</L>
<L>Our Fountains too a dire Infection yield,</L>
<L>For Crowds of Vipers creep along the Field,</L>
<L>And with polluted Gore, and baneful Steams,</L>
<L>Taint all the Lakes, and venom all the Streams.</L>
<L>The young Disease with milder Force began,</L>
<L>And rag'd on Birds and Beasts, excusing Man.</L>
<L>The lab'ring Oxen fall before the Plow,</L>
<L>Th' unhappy Plow-men stare, and wonder how:</L>
<L>The tabid Sheep, with sickly Bleatings, pines;</L>
<L>Its Wooll decreasing, as its Strength declines:</L>
<L>The warlike Steed, by inward Foes compell'd,</L>
<L>Neglects his Honours, and deserts the Field;</L>
<L>Unnerv'd and languid, seeks a base Retreat,</L>
<L>And at the Manger groans, but wish'd a nobler Fate:</L>
<L>The Stags forget their Speed, the Boars their Rage,</L>
<L>Nor can the Bears the stronger Herds engage:</L>
<L>A gen'ral Faintness does invade 'em all,</L>
<L>And in the Woods and Fields promiscuously they fall.</L>
<L>The Air receives the Stench, and (strange to say)</L>
<L>The rav'nous Birds and Beasts avoid the Prey:</L>
<L>Th' offensive Bodies rot upon the Ground,</L>
<L>And spread the dire Contagion all around.</L>
<L>But now the Plague, grown to a larger Size,</L>
<L>Riots on Man, and scorns a meaner Prize.</L>
<L>Intestine Heats begin the Civil War,</L>
<L>And Flushings first the latent Flame declare,</L>
<L>And Breath inspir'd, which seem'd like fiery Air.</L>
<L>Their black dry Tongues are swell'd, and scarce can move,</L>
<L>And short thick Sighs from panting Lungs are drove.</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="277"/>
They gape for Air, with flatt'ring Hopes t'abate</L>
<L>Their raging Flames, but that augments their Heat.</L>
<L>No Bed, no Cov'ring can the Wretches bear,</L>
<L>But on the Ground, expos'd to open Air,</L>
<L>They lye, and hope to find a pleasing Coolness there.</L>
<L>The suff'ring Earth, with that Oppression curst,</L>
<L>Returns the Heat which they imparted first.</L>
<L>In vain Physicians would bestow their Aid,</L>
<L>Vain all their Art, and useless all their Trade;</L>
<L>And they, ev'n they, who fleeting Life recall,</L>
<L>Feel the same Pow'rs, and undistinguish'd fall.</L>
<L>If any proves so daring to attend</L>
<L>His sick Companion, or his darling Friend,</L>
<L>Th' officious Wretch sucks in contagious Breath,</L>
<L>And with his Friend does sympathize in Death.</L>
<L>And now the Care and Hopes of Life are past,</L>
<L>They please their Fancies, and indulge their Taste;</L>
<L>At Brooks and Streams, regardless of their Shame,</L>
<L>Each Sex, promiscuous, strives to quench their Flame;</L>
<L>Nor do they strive in vain to quench it there,</L>
<L>For Thirst and Life at once extinguish'd are.</L>
<L>Thus in the Brooks the dying Bodies sink,</L>
<L>But heedless still the rash Survivors drink.</L>
<L>So much uneasy Down the Wretches hate,</L>
<L>They fly their Beds to struggle with their Fate;</L>
<L>But if decaying Strength forbids to rise,</L>
<L>The Victim crawls and rouls, till on the Ground he lies.</L>
<L>Each shuns his Bed, as each wou'd shun his Tomb,</L>
<L>And thinks th' Infection only lodg'd at home.</L>
<L>Here one, with fainting steps, does slowly creep</L>
<L>O'er Heaps of Dead, and straight augments a Heap;</L>
<L><PB N="241" REF="278"/>
Another, while his Strength and Tongue prevail'd,</L>
<L>Bewails his Friend, and falls himself bewail'd:</L>
<L>This with imploring Looks surveys the Skies,</L>
<L>The last dear Office of his closing Eyes,</L>
<L>But finds the Heav'ns implacable, and dies.</L>
<L>What now, ah! what employ'd my troubled Mind?</L>
<L>But only Hopes my Subjects Fate to find.</L>
<L>What Place soe'er my weeping Eyes survey,</L>
<L>There in lamented Heaps the Vulgar lay;</L>
<L>As Acorns scatter when the Winds prevail,</L>
<L>Or mellow Fruit from shaken Branches fall.</L>
<L>You see that Dome which rears its Front so high:</L>
<L>'Tis sacred to the Monarch of the Sky:</L>
<L>How many there, with unregarded Tears,</L>
<L>And fruitless Vows, sent up successless Pray'rs?</L>
<L>There Fathers for expiring Sons implor'd,</L>
<L>And there the Wife bewail'd her gasping Lord;</L>
<L>With pious Off'rings they'd appease the Skies,</L>
<L>But they, e're yet th' attoning Vapours rise,</L>
<L>Before the Altars fall, themselves a Sacrifice:</L>
<L>They fall, while yet their Hands the Gums contain,</L>
<L>The Gums surviving, but their Off'rers slain.</L>
<L>The destin'd Ox, with holy Garlands crown'd,</L>
<L>Prevents the Blow, and feels an unexpected Wound:</L>
<L>When I my self invok'd the Pow'rs Divine,</L>
<L>To drive the fatal Pest from Me and Mine;</L>
<L>When now the Priest with Hands uplifted stood,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to strike, and shed the sacred Blood,</L>
<L>The Gods themselves the mortal Stroke bestow,</L>
<L>The Victim falls, but They impart the Blow:</L>
<L><PB N="242" REF="279"/>
Scarce was the Knife with the pale Purple stain'd,</L>
<L>And no Presages cou'd be then obtain'd,</L>
<L>From putrid Entrails, where th' Infection reign'd.</L>
<L>Death stalk'd around with such resistless Sway,</L>
<L>The Temples of the Gods his Force obey,</L>
<L>And Suppliants feel his Stroke while yet they pray.</L>
<L>Go now, said he, your Deities implore</L>
<L>For fruitless Aid, for I defie their Pow'r.</L>
<L>Then with a curst malicious Joy survey'd</L>
<L>The very Altars, stain'd with Trophies of the Dead.</L>
<L>The rest grown mad, and frantick with Despair,</L>
<L>Urge their own Fate, and so prevent the Fear.</L>
<L>Strange Madness, that, when Death pursu'd so fast,</L>
<L>T' anticipate the Blow with impious Haste.</L>
<L>No decent Honour to their Urns are paid,</L>
<L>Nor cou'd the Graves receive the num'rous Dead;</L>
<L>For, or they lay unbury'd on the Ground,</L>
<L>Or unadorn'd a needy Fun'ral found:</L>
<L>All Rev'rence past, the fainting Wretches fight</L>
<L>For Fun'ral Piles which were another's Right.</L>
<L>Unmourn'd they fall, for who surviv'd to mourn?</L>
<L>And Sires and Mothers unlamented burn:</L>
<L>Parents and Sons sustain an equal Fate,</L>
<L>And wand'ring Ghosts their kindred Shadows meet.</L>
<L>The Dead a larger Space of Ground require,</L>
<L>Nor are the Trees sufficient for the Fire.</L>
<L>Despairing under Grief's oppressive Weight,</L>
<L>And sunk by these tempestuous Blasts of Fate,</L>
<L>O <HI>Jove,</HI> said I, if common Fame says true,</L>
<L>If e'er <HI>Aegina</HI> gave those Joys to you,</L>
<L><PB N="243" REF="280"/>
If e'er you lay enclos'd in her Embrace,</L>

<L>Paternal Care, nor yet disown the Name;</L>
<L>Grant my Petitions, and with Speed restore</L>
<L>My Subjects num'rous as they were before,</L>
<L>Or make me Partner of the Fate they bore.</L>
<L>I spoke, and glorious Lightning shone around,</L>
<L>And ratling Thunder gave a prosp'rous Sound;</L>
<L>So let it be, and may these Omens prove</L>
<L>A Pledge, said I, of your returning Love.</L>
<L>By chance a rev'rend Oak was near the Place,</L>
<L>Sacred to <HI>Jove,</HI> and of <HI>Dodona</HI>'s Race,</L>
<L>Where frugal Ants laid up their Winter Meat,</L>
<L>Whose little Bodies bear a mighty Weight:</L>
<L>We saw them march along, and hide their Store,</L>
<L>And much admir'd their Number, and their Pow'r;</L>
<L>Admir'd at first, but after envy'd more.</L>
<L>Full of Amazement, thus to <HI>Jove</HI> I pray'd,</L>
<L>O grant, since thus my Subjects are decay'd,</L>
<L>As many Subjects to supply the Dead.</L>
<L>I pray'd, and strange Convulsions mov'd the Oak,</L>
<L>Which murmur'd, tho' by ambient Winds unshook:</L>
<L>My trembling Hands, and stiff erected Hair,</L>
<L>Exprest all Tokens of uncommon Fear;</L>
<L>Yet both the Earth and sacred Oak I kist,</L>
<L>And scarce cou'd hope, yet still I hop'd the best;</L>
<L>For Wretches, whatsoe'er the Fates divine,</L>
<L>Expound all Omens to their own Design.</L>
<L>But now 'twas Night, when ev'n Distraction wears</L>
<L>A pleasing Look, and Dreams beguile our Cares.</L>
<L><PB N="244" REF="281"/>
Lo! The same Oak appears before my Eyes,</L>
<L>Nor alter'd in its Shape, nor former Size;</L>
<L>As many Ants the num'rous Branches bear,</L>
<L>The same their Labour, and their frugal Care;</L>
<L>The Branches too a like Commotion found,</L>
<L>And shook th'industrious Creatures on the Ground,</L>
<L>Who, by degrees (what's scarce to be believ'd)</L>
<L>A nobler Form, and larger Bulk receiv'd,</L>
<L>And on the Earth walk'd an unusual Pace,</L>
<L>With manly Strides, and an erected Face;</L>
<L>Their num'rous Legs, and former Colour lost,</L>
<L>The Insects cou'd a Human Figure boast.</L>
<L>I wake, and waking find my Cares again,</L>
<L>And to the unperforming Gods complain,</L>
<L>And call their Promise and Pretences vain.</L>
<L>Yet in my Court I heard the murm'ring Voice</L>
<L>Of Strangers, and a mixt uncommon Noise:</L>
<L>But I suspected all was still a Dream,</L>
<L>'Till <HI>Telamon</HI> to my Apartment came,</L>

The Guest then interrupts him—'Twou'd produce</L>
<L>Still greater Wonder, if you knew its Use.</L>
<L>It never fails to strike the Game, and then</L>
<L>Comes bloody back into your Hand again.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/></HI> each Particular desires,</L>
<L>And th' Author of the wond'rous Gift enquires.</L>
<L>To which the Owner thus, with weeping Eyes,</L>
<L>And Sorrow for his Wife's sad Fate, replies,</L>
<L>This Weapon here (O Prince!) can you believe</L>
<L>This Dart the Cause for which so much I grieve;</L>
<L>And shall continue to grieve on, 'till Fate</L>
<L>Afford such wretched Life no longer Date.</L>
<L>Would I this fatal Gift had ne'er enjoy'd,</L>
<L>This fatal Gift my tender Wife destroy'd:</L>
<L><HI>Procris</HI> her Name, ally'd in Charms and Blood</L>
<L>To fair <HI>Orythia</HI> courted by a God.</L>
<L>Her Father seal'd my Hopes with Rites Divine,</L>
<L>But firmer Love before had made her mine.</L>
<L>Men call'd me blest, and blest I was indeed.</L>
<L>The second Month our Nuptials did succeed;</L>
<L>When (as upon <HI>Hymettus</HI>' dewy Head,</L>
<L>For Mountain Stags, my Net betimes I spread)</L>
<L><HI>Aurora</HI> spy'd, and ravish'd me away,</L>
<L>With Rev'rence to the Goddess, I must say,</L>
<L>Against my Will, for <HI>Procris</HI> had my Heart,</L>
<L>Nor wou'd her Image from my Thoughts depart.</L>
<L>At last, in Rage she cry'd, Ingrateful Boy</L>
<L>Go to your <HI>Procris,</HI> take your fatal Joy;</L>
<L>And so dismiss'd me: Musing, as I went,</L>
<L>What those Expressions of the Goddess meant,</L>
<L>A thousand jealous Fears possess me now,</L>
<L>Lest <HI>Procris</HI> had prophan'd her Nuptial Vow:</L>
<L><PB N="247" REF="284"/>
Her Youth and Charms did to my Fancy paint</L>
<L>A lewd Adultress, but her Life a Saint.</L>
<L>Yet I was absent long, the Goddess too</L>
<L>Taught me how far a Woman cou'd be true.</L>
<L><HI>Aurora</HI>'s Treatment much Suspicion bred;</L>
<L>Besides, who truly love, ev'n Shadows dread.</L>
<L>I strait impatient for the Tryal grew,</L>
<L>What Courtship back'd with richest Gifts cou'd do.</L>
<L><HI>Aurora</HI>'s Envy aided my Design,</L>
<L>And lent me Features far unlike to mine.</L>
<L>In this Disguise to my own House I came,</L>
<L>But all was chaste, no conscious Sign of Blame:</L>
<L>With thousand Arts I scarce Admittance found,</L>
<L>And then beheld her weeping on the Ground</L>
<L>For her lost Husband; hardly I retain'd</L>
<L>My Purpose, scarce the wish'd Embrace refrain'd.</L>
<L>How charming was her Grief! Then, <HI>Phocus,</HI> guess</L>
<L>What killing Beauties waited on her Dress.</L>
<L>Her constant Answer, when my Suit I prest,</L>
<L>Forbear, my Lord's dear Image guards this Breast;</L>
<L>Where-e'er he is, whatever Cause detains,</L>
<L>Who-e'er has his, my Heart unmov'd remains.</L>
<L>What greater Proofs of Truth than these cou'd be?</L>
<L>Yet I persist, and urge my Destiny.</L>
<L>At length, she found, when my own Form return'd,</L>
<L>Her jealous Lover there, whose Loss she mourn'd.</L>
<L>Enrag'd with my Suspicion, swift as Wind,</L>
<L>She fled at once from me and all Mankind;</L>
<L>And so became, her Purpose to retain,</L>
<L>A Nymph, and Huntress in <HI>Diana</HI>'s Train:</L>
<L>Forsaken thus, I found my Flames encrease,</L>
<L>I own'd my Folly, and I su'd for Peace.</L>
<L><PB N="248" REF="285"/>
It was a Fault, but not of Guilt, to move</L>
<L>Such Punishment, a Fault of too much Love.</L>
<L>Thus I retriev'd her to my longing Arms,</L>
<L>And many happy Days possess'd her Charms.</L>
<L>But with herself she kindly did confer,</L>
<L>What Gifts the Goddess had bestow'd on her;</L>
<L>The fleetest Grey-hound, with this lovely Dart,</L>
<L>And I of both have Wonders to impart.</L>
<L>Near <HI>Thebes</HI> a Savage Beast, of Race unknown,</L>
<L>Laid waste the Field, and bore the Vineyards down;</L>
<L>The Swains fled from him, and with one Consent</L>
<L>Our <HI>Grecian</HI> Youth to chase the Monster went;</L>
<L>More swift than Light'ning he the Toils surpast,</L>
<L>And in his Course Spears, Men, and Trees o'er-cast.</L>
<L>We slipt our Dogs, and last my <HI>Lelaps</HI> too,</L>
<L>When none of all the mortal Race wou'd do:</L>
<L>He long before was struggling from my Hands,</L>
<L>And, e're we cou'd unloose him, broke his Bands.</L>
<L>That Minute where he was we cou'd not find,</L>
<L>And only saw the Dust he left behind.</L>
<L>I climb'd a neighb'ring Hill to view the Chase,</L>
<L>While in the Plain they held an equal Race;</L>
<L>The Savage now seems caught, and now by Force</L>
<L>To quit himself, nor holds the same strait Course;</L>
<L>But running counter, from the Foe withdraws,</L>
<L>And with short Turning cheats his gaping Jaws:</L>
<L>Which he retrieves, and still so closely prest,</L>
<L>You'd fear at ev'ry Stretch he were possess'd;</L>
<L>Yet for the Gripe his Fangs in vain prepare,</L>
<L>The Game shoots from him, and he chops the Air.</L>
<L>To cast my Jav'lin then I took my Stand;</L>
<L>But as the Thongs were fitting to my Hand,</L>
<L><PB N="249" REF="286"/>
While to the Valley I o'er-look'd the Wood,</L>
<L>Before my Eyes two Marble Statues stood.</L>
<L>That, as pursu'd, appearing at full Stretch,</L>
<L>This barking after, and at point to catch.</L>
<L>Some God their Course did with this Wonder grace,</L>
<L>That neither might be conquer'd in the Chase;</L>
<L>A sudden Silence here his Tongue supprest,</L>
<L>He here stops short, and fain wou'd wave the rest.</L>
<L>The eager Prince then urg'd him to impart,</L>
<L>The Fortune that attended on the Dart.</L>
<L>First then (said he) past Joys let me relate,</L>
<L>For Bliss was the Foundation of my Fate.</L>
<L>No Language can those happy Hours express,</L>
<L>Did from our Nuptials me and <HI>Procris</HI> bless:</L>
<L>The kindest Pair! What more cou'd Heav'n confer?</L>
<L>For She was all to me, and I to her.</L>
<L>Had <HI>Jove</HI> made Love, great <HI>Jove</HI> had been despis'd;</L>
<L>And I my <HI>Procris</HI> more than <HI>Venus</HI> priz'd:</L>
<L>Thus while no other Joy we did aspire,</L>
<L>We grew at last one Soul, and one Desire.</L>
<L>Forth to the Woods I went at Break of Day,</L>
<L>(The constant Practice of my Youth) for Prey:</L>
<L>Nor yet for Servant, Horse, or Dog did call,</L>
<L>I found this single Dart to serve for all.</L>
<L>With Slaughter tir'd, I sought the cooler Shade,</L>
<L>And Winds that from the Mountains pierc'd the Glade:</L>
<L>Come, gentle Air, (so was I wont to say)</L>
<L>Come, gentle Air, sweet <HI>Aura</HI> come away.</L>
<L>This always was the Burden of my Song,</L>
<L>Come 'swage my Flames, sweet <HI>Aura</HI> come along.</L>
<L>Thou always art most welcome to my Breast;</L>
<L>I faint; approach, thou dearest, kindest Guest!</L>
<L><PB N="250" REF="287"/>
These Blandishments, and more than these, I said,</L>
<L>(By Fate to unsuspected Ruin led)</L>
<L>Thou art my Joy, for thy dear sake I love</L>
<L>Each desart Hill and solitary Grove;</L>
<L>When (faint with Labour) I Refreshment need,</L>
<L>For Cordials on thy fragrant Breath I feed.</L>
<L>At last a wand'ring Swain in hearing came,</L>
<L>And cheated with the Sound of <HI>Aura</HI>'s Name,</L>
<L>He thought I had some Assignation made;</L>
<L>And to my <HI>Procris</HI>' Ear the News convey'd.</L>
<L>Great Love is soonest with Suspicion fir'd,</L>
<L>She swoon'd, and with the Tale almost expir'd.</L>
<L>Ah! wretched Heart, (she cry'd) ah! faithless Man!</L>
<L>And then to curse th' imagin'd Nymph began:</L>
<L>Yet oft she doubts, oft hopes she is deceiv'd,</L>
<L>And chides herself that ever she believ'd</L>
<L>Her Lord to such Injustice cou'd proceed,</L>
<L>Till she herself were Witness of the Deed.</L>
<L>Next Morn I to the Woods again repair,</L>
<L>And, weary with the Chase, invoke the Air;</L>
<L>Approach, dear <HI>Aura,</HI> and my Bosom chear:</L>
<L>At which a mournful Sound did strike my Ear;</L>
<L>Yet I proceeded, 'till the Thicket by,</L>
<L>With rustling Noise and Motion, drew my Eye;</L>
<L>I thought some Beast of Prey was shelter'd there,</L>
<L>And to the Covert threw my certain Spear;</L>
<L>From whence a tender Sigh my Soul did wound,</L>
<L>Ah me! it cry'd, and did like <HI>Procris</HI> sound.</L>
<L><HI>Procris</HI> was there, too well the Voice I knew,</L>
<L>And to the Place with headlong Horror flew;</L>
<L>Where I beheld her gasping on the Ground,</L>
<L>In vain attempting from the deadly Wound</L>
<L><PB N="251" REF="288"/>
To draw the Dart, her Love's dear fatal Gift!</L>
<L>My guilty Arms had scarce the Strength to lift</L>
<L>The beauteous Load; my Silks and Hair I tore</L>
<L>(If possible) to stanch the pressing Gore;</L>
<L>For Pity begg'd her keep her flitting Breath,</L>
<L>And not to leave me guilty of her Death.</L>
<L>While I intreat she fainted fast away,</L>
<L>And these few Words had only Strength to say;</L>
<L>By all the sacred Bonds of plighted Love,</L>
<L>By all your Rev'rence to the Pow'rs above,</L>
<L>By all that made me charming once appear,</L>
<L>By all the Truth for which you held me dear,</L>
<L>And last by Love, the Cause through which I bleed,</L>
<L>Let <HI>Aura</HI> never to my Bed succeed.</L>
<L>I then perceiv'd the Error of our Fate,</L>
<L>And told it her, but found and told too late!</L>
<L>I felt her lower to my Bosom fall,</L>
<L>And while her Eyes had any Sight at all,</L>
<L>On mine she fix'd them; in her Pangs still prest</L>
<L>My Hand, and sigh'd her Soul into my Breast;</L>
<L>Yet, being undeceiv'd, resign'd her Breath</L>
<L>Methought more chearfully, and smil'd in Death.</L>
<L>With such Concern the weeping Heroe told</L>
<L>This Tale, that none who heard him cou'd with-hold</L>
<L>From melting into sympathizing Tears,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Aeacus</HI> with his two Sons appears;</L>
<L>Whom he commits, with their new-levy'd Bands,</L>
<L>To Fortune's, and so brave a Gen'ral's Hands.</L>

<L>On whose grey Head a Lock of Purple Hue,</L>

Six Moons were gone and past, when still from far</L>
<L><HI>Victoria</HI> hover'd o'er the doubtful War.</L>
<L>So long, to both inclin'd, th' impartial Maid</L>
<L>Between 'em both her equal Wings display'd.</L>
<L>High on the Walls, by <HI>Phoebus</HI> vocal made,</L>
<L>A Turret of the Palace rais'd its Head;</L>
<L>And where the God his tuneful Harp resign'd,</L>
<L>The Sound within the Stones still lay enshrin'd.</L>
<L>Hither the Daughter of the Purple King</L>
<L>Ascended oft, to hear its Musick ring;</L>
<L>And, striking with a Pebble, wou'd release</L>
<L>Th' enchanted Notes, in Times of happy Peace.</L>
<L>Now too, from thence, the curious Maid beheld</L>
<L>Rough Feats of Arms, and Combats of the Field:</L>
<L>And, since the Siege was long, had learnt the Name</L>
<L>Of ev'ry Chief, his Character, and Fame;</L>
<L>Their Arms, their Horse, and Quiver she descry'd,</L>
<L>Nor cou'd the Dress of War the Warrior hide.</L>
<L><HI>Europa</HI>'s Son she knew above the Rest,</L>
<L>And more, than well became a Virgin Breast:</L>
<L>In vain the crested Morion veils his Face,</L>
<L>She thinks it adds a more peculiar Grace:</L>
<L>His ample Shield, embost with burnish'd Gold,</L>
<L>Still makes the Bearer lovelier to behold:</L>

<L>And his fine Limbs a manly Posture show,</L>
<L>Compar'd with <HI>Phoebus,</HI> he performs so well,</L>
<L>Let her be Judge, and <HI>Minos</HI> shall excell.</L>
<L>But when the Helm, put off, display'd to Sight,</L>

When, vaulting to his Seat, his Steed he prest,</L>
<L>Caparison'd in Gold, and richly drest;</L>
<L>Himself in Scarlet sumptuously array'd,</L>
<L>New Passions rise, and fire the frantick Maid.</L>
<L>O happy Spear! she cries, that feels his Touch;</L>
<L>Nay, ev'n the Reins he holds are blest too much.</L>
<L>Oh! were it lawful, she cou'd wing her Way</L>
<L>Thro' the stern hostile Troops without Dismay;</L>
<L>Or throw her Body to the distant Ground,</L>
<L>And in the <HI>Cretans</HI> happy Camp be found.</L>
<L>Wou'd <HI>Minos</HI> but desire it! she'd expose</L>
<L>Her native Country to her Country's Foes;</L>
<L>Unbar the Gates, the Town with Flames infest,</L>
<L>Or any thing that <HI>Minos</HI> shou'd request.</L>
<L>And, as she sate, and pleas'd her longing Sight,</L>
<L>Viewing the King's Pavilion veil'd with White,</L>
<L>Shou'd Joy, or Grief, she said, possess my Breast,</L>
<L>To see my Country by a War opprest?</L>
<L>I'm in Suspense: For, tho' 'tis Grief to know</L>
<L>I love a Man that is declar'd my Foe;</L>
<L>Yet, in my own Despite, I must approve</L>
<L>That lucky War, which brought the Man I love.</L>

<L>Oh! with what Joy I'd wear the Chains he gave!</L>
<L>A patient Hostage, and a willing Slave.</L>
<L>Thou lovely Object! if the Nymph that bare</L>
<L>Thy charming Person, were but half so fair;</L>
<L>Well might a God her Virgin Bloom desire,</L>
<L>And with a Rape indulge his amorous Fire.</L>
<L>Oh! had I Wings to glide along the Air,</L>
<L>To his dear Tent I'd fly, and settle there:</L>

There tell my Quality, confess my Flame,</L>
<L>And grant him any Dowry that he'd name.</L>
<L>All, all I'd give; only my native Land,</L>
<L>My dearest Country, shou'd excepted stand.</L>
<L>For, perish Love, and all expected Joys,</L>
<L>E're, with so base a Thought, my Soul complies.</L>
<L>Yet, oft the Vanquish'd some Advantage find,</L>
<L>When conquer'd by a noble, gen'rous Mind.</L>

<L>And will, with Victory, his Arms reward:</L>
<L>We must be conquer'd; and the Captive's Fate</L>
<L>Will surely seize us, tho' it seize us late.</L>
<L>Why then shou'd Love be idle, and neglect</L>
<L>What <HI>Mars,</HI> by Arms and Perils, will effect?</L>
<L>Oh! Prince, I dye, with anxious Fear opprest,</L>

His Boy, young <HI>Icarus,</HI> that near him stood,</L>

<L>Then thus instructs his Child; My Boy, take Care</L>
<L>To wing your Course along the middle Air;</L>
<L>If low, the Surges wet your flagging Plumes,</L>
<L>If high, the Sun the melting Wax consumes:</L>

<L>Nor South <HI>Orion</HI> turn your giddy Eyes;</L>
<L>But follow me: Let me before you lay</L>
<L>Rules for the Flight, and mark the pathless Way.</L>

<L>T' expel the Shaft from her contracted Bow:</L>

<L>And from the Wound appear'd the trickling Blood.</L>
<L>She blush'd for Joy: But <HI>Meleagros</HI> rais'd</L>
<L>His Voice with loud Applause, and the fair Archer prais'd.</L>
<L>He was the first to see, and first to show</L>
<L>His Friends the Marks of the successful Blow.</L>
<L>Nor shall thy Valour want the Praises due,</L>

<L>Stand on a mod'rate Rise, with Wonder shown,</L>

<L>To <HI>Phrygian</HI> Realms, my Grandsire's Government.</L>
<L>Not far from thence is seen a Lake, the Haunt</L>

<L>Not one of all the thousand but was lock'd.</L>
<L>At last an hospitable House they found,</L>
<L>A homely Shed; the Roof, not far from Ground,</L>
<L>Was thatch'd with Reeds and Straw together bound.</L>
<L>There <HI>Baucis</HI> and <HI>Philemon</HI> liv'd, and there</L>

<L><HI>Pallas</HI> began the Feast, where first was seen</L>

<L>A Garden-Sallad was the third Supply,</L>

<L>And new-laid Eggs, which <HI>Baucis</HI>' busie Care</L>
<L>Turn'd by a gentle Fire, and roasted rare.</L>
<L>All these in Earthen Ware were serv'd to Board;</L>
<L>And next in place, an Earthen Pitcher stor'd,</L>
<L>With Liquor of the best the Cottage cou'd afford.</L>
<L>This was the Table's Ornament, and Pride,</L>
<L>With Figures wrought: Like Pages at his Side</L>
<L>Stood Beechen Bowls; and these were shining clean.</L>
<L>Varnish'd with Wax without, and lin'd within.</L>
<L>By this the boiling Kettle had prepar'd,</L>
<L>And to the Table sent, the smoaking Lard;</L>
<L><PB N="286" REF="323"/>
On which with eager Appetite they dine,</L>
<L>A sav'ry Bit, that serv'd to rellish Wine:</L>
<L>The Wine itself was suiting to the rest,</L>
<L>Still working in the Must, and lately press'd.</L>
<L>The second Course succeeds like that before,</L>
<L>Plums, Apples, Nuts; and of their wintry Store</L>
<L>Dry Figs, and Grapes, and wrinkled Dates were set</L>
<L>In Canisters, t'enlarge the little Treat:</L>
<L>All these a Milk-white Honey-comb surround,</L>
<L>Which in the Midst the Country-Banquet crown'd:</L>
<L>But the kind Hosts their Entertainment grace</L>
<L>With hearty Welcome, and an open Face:</L>
<L>In all they did, you might discern with Ease</L>
<L>A willing Mind, and a Desire to please.</L>
<L>Mean time the Beechen Bowls went round, and still,</L>
<L>Though often empty'd, were observ'd to fill;</L>
<L>Fill'd without Hands, and of their own Accord</L>
<L>Ran without Feet, and danc'd about the Board.</L>
<L>Devotion seiz'd the Pair, to see the Feast</L>
<L>With Wine, and of no common Grape, increas'd;</L>
<L>And up they held their Hands, and fell to Pray'r,</L>
<L>Excusing, as they cou'd, their Country Fare.</L>
<L>One Goose they had, ('twas all they cou'd allow)</L>
<L>A wakeful Centry, and on Duty now,</L>
<L>Whom to the Gods for Sacrifice they vow:</L>
<L>Her, with malicious Zeal, the Couple view'd;</L>
<L>She ran for Life, and limping they pursu'd:</L>
<L>Full well the Fowl perceiv'd their bad Intent,</L>
<L>And wou'd not make her Master's Compliment;</L>
<L>But persecuted, to the Pow'rs she flies,</L>
<L>And close between the Legs of <HI>Jove</HI> she lies:</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="324"/>
He with a gracious Ear the Suppliant heard,</L>
<L>And sav'd her Life; then what he was declar'd,</L>
<L>And own'd the God. The Neighbourhood, said he,</L>
<L>Shall justly perish for Impiety:</L>
<L>You stand alone exempted; but obey</L>
<L>With Speed, and follow where we lead the Way:</L>
<L>Leave these accurs'd; and to the Mountain's Height</L>
<L>Ascend; nor once look backward in your Flight.</L>
<L>They haste, and what their tardy Feet deny'd,</L>
<L>The trusty Staff (their better Leg) supply'd.</L>
<L>An Arrow's Flight they wanted to the Top,</L>
<L>And there secure, but spent with Travel, stop;</L>
<L>Then turn their now no more forbidden Eyes;</L>
<L>Lost in a Lake the floated Level lies:</L>
<L>A watry Desart covers all the Plains,</L>
<L>Their Cot alone, as in an Isle, remains.</L>
<L>Wondring with weeping Eyes, while they deplore</L>
<L>Their Neighbours Fate, and Country now no more,</L>
<L>Their little Shed, scarce large enough for Two,</L>
<L>Seems, from the Ground increas'd, in Height and Bulk to grow.</L>
<L>A stately Temple shoots within the Skies,</L>
<L>The Crotches of their Cot in Columns rise:</L>
<L>The Pavement polish'd Marble they behold,</L>
<L>The Gates with Sculpture grac'd, the Spires and Tiles of Gold.</L>
<L>Then thus the Sire of Gods, with Looks serene,</L>
<L>Speak thy Desire, thou only. Just of Men;</L>
<L>And thou, O Woman, only worthy found</L>
<L>To be with such a Man in Marriage bound.</L>
<L>Awhile they whisper; then, to <HI>Jove</HI> address'd,</L>
<L><HI>Philemon</HI> thus prefers their joint Request:</L>
<L>We crave to serve before your sacred Shrine,</L>
<L>And offer at your Altars Rites Divine:</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="325"/>
And since not any Action of our Life</L>
<L>Has been polluted with Domestick Strife;</L>
<L>We beg one Hour of Death; that neither she</L>
<L>With Widow's Tears may live to bury me,</L>
<L>Nor weeping I, with wither'd Arms may bear</L>
<L>My breathless <HI>Baucis</HI> to the Sepulcher.</L>
<L>The Godheads sign their Suit. They run their Race</L>
<L>In the same Tenour all th'appointed Space:</L>
<L>Then, when their Hour was come, while they relate</L>
<L>These past Adventures at the Temple Gate,</L>
<L>Old <HI>Baucis</HI> is by old <HI>Philemon</HI> seen</L>
<L>Sprouting with sudden Leaves of spritely Green:</L>
<L>Old <HI>Baucis</HI> look'd where old <HI>Philemon</HI> stood,</L>
<L>And saw his lengthen'd Arms a sprouting Wood:</L>
<L>New Roots their fasten'd Feet begin to bind,</L>
<L>Their Bodies stiffen in a rising Rind:</L>
<L>Then, ere the Bark above their Shoulders grew,</L>
<L>They give, and take at once their last Adieu.</L>
<L>At once, Farewel, O faithful Spouse, they said;</L>
<L>At once th' incroaching Rinds their closing Lips invade.</L>
<L>Ev'n yet, an ancient <HI>Tyanaean</HI> shows</L>
<L>A spreading Oak, that near a Linden grows;</L>
<L>The Neighbourhood confirm the Prodigy,</L>
<L>Grave Men, not vain of Tongue, or like to lie.</L>
<L>I saw my self the Garlands on their Boughs,</L>
<L>And Tablets hung for Gifts of granted Vows;</L>
<L>And off'ring fresher up, with pious Pray'r,</L>
<L>The Good, said I, are God's peculiar Care,</L>

<HEAD>The Story of ERISICHTHON.</HEAD>
<L>In various Shapes thus to deceive the Eyes,</L>
<L>Without a settled Stint of her Disguise,</L>
<L>Rash <HI>Erisichthon</HI>'s Daughter had the Pow'r,</L>
<L>And brought it to <HI>Autolicus</HI> in Dow'r.</L>
<L>Her Atheist Sire the slighted Gods defy'd,</L>
<L>And ritual Honours to their Shrines deny'd.</L>
<L>As Fame reports, his Hand an Ax sustain'd,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Ceres</HI>' consecrated Grove prophan'd;</L>
<L><PB N="290" REF="327"/>
Which durst the venerable Gloom invade,</L>
<L>And violate with Light the awful Shade.</L>
<L>An ancient Oak in the dark Center stood,</L>
<L>The Covert's Glory, and itself a Wood;</L>
<L>Garlands embrac'd its Shaft, and from the Boughs</L>
<L>Hung Tablets, Monuments of prosp'rous Vows.</L>
<L>In the cool Dusk its unpierc'd Verdure spread,</L>
<L>The <HI>Dryads</HI> oft their hallow'd Dances led;</L>
<L>And oft, when round their gaging Arms they cast,</L>
<L>Full fifteen Ells it measur'd in the Waste:</L>
<L>Its Height all under Standards did surpass,</L>
<L>As they aspir'd above the humbler Grass.</L>
<L>These Motives, which would gentler Minds restrain,</L>
<L>Could not make <HI>Triope</HI>'s bold Son abstain;</L>
<L>He sternly charg'd his Slaves with strict Decree,</L>
<L>To fell with gashing Steel the sacred Tree.</L>
<L>But whilst they, lingring, his Commands delay'd,</L>
<L>He snatch'd an Ax, and thus blaspheming said:</L>
<L>Was this no Oak, nor <HI>Ceres</HI>' fav'rite Care,</L>
<L>But <HI>Ceres</HI>' self, this Arm, unaw'd, shou'd dare</L>
<L>Its leafy Honours in the Dust to spread,</L>
<L>And level with the Earth its airy Head.</L>
<L>He spoke, and as he poiz'd a slanting Stroak,</L>
<L>Sighs heav'd, and Tremblings shook the frighted Oak;</L>
<L>Its Leaves look'd sickly, pale its Acorns grew,</L>
<L>And its long Branches sweat a chilly Dew.</L>
<L>But when his impious Hand a Wound bestow'd,</L>
<L>Blood from the mangled Bark in Currents flow'd.</L>
<L>When a devoted Bull of mighty Size,</L>
<L>A sinning Nation's grand Atonement, dies;</L>
<L>With such a Plenty from the spouting Veins,</L>
<L>A crimson Stream the turfy Altar stains.</L>
<L><PB N="291" REF="328"/>
The Wonder all amaz'd; yet one more bold,</L>
<L>The Fact disswading, strove his Ax to hold.</L>
<L>But the <HI>Thessalian,</HI> obstinately bent,</L>
<L>Too proud to change, too harden'd to repent,</L>
<L>On his kind Monitor his Eyes, which burn'd</L>
<L>With Rage, and with his Eyes his Weapon turn'd;</L>
<L>Take the Reward, says he, of pious Dread:</L>
<L>Then with a Blow lop'd off his parted Head.</L>
<L>No longer check'd, the Wretch his Crime pursu'd,</L>
<L>Doubled his Strokes, and Sacrilege renew'd;</L>
<L>When from the groaning Trunk a Voice was heard,</L>
<L>A <HI>Dryad</HI> I, by <HI>Ceres</HI>' Love prefer'd,</L>
<L>Within the Circle of this clasping Rind</L>
<L>Coeval grew, and now in Ruin joyn'd;</L>
<L>But instant Vengeance shall thy Sin pursue,</L>
<L>And Death is chear'd with this prophetick View.</L>
<L>At last the Oak with Cords enforc'd to bow,</L>
<L>Strain'd from the Top, and sap'd with Wounds below,</L>
<L>The humbler Wood, Partaker of its Fate,</L>
<L>Crush'd with its Fall, and shiver'd with its Weight.</L>
<L>The Grove destroy'd, the Sister <HI>Dryads</HI> moan,</L>
<L>Griev'd at its Loss, and frighted at their own.</L>
<L>Strait, Suppliants for Revenge, to <HI>Ceres</HI> go,</L>
<L>In sable Weeds, expressive of their Woe.</L>
<L>The beauteous Goddess with a graceful Air</L>
<L>Bow'd in Consent, and nodded to their Pray'r.</L>
<L>The awful Motion shook the fruitful Ground,</L>
<L>And wav'd the Fields with golden Harvests crown'd.</L>
<L>Soon she contriv'd in her projecting Mind</L>
<L>A Plague severe, and piteous in its Kind,</L>

<HEAD>The Description of FAMINE.</HEAD>
<L>Where frozen <HI>Scythia</HI>'s utmost Bound is plac'd,</L>
<L>A Desart lies, a melancholy Waste:</L>
<L>In yellow Crops there Nature never smil'd,</L>
<L>No fruitful Tree to shade the barren Wild.</L>
<L>There sluggish Cold its icy Station makes,</L>
<L>There Paleness, Frights, and aguish Trembling shakes.</L>
<L>Of pining Famine this the fated Seat,</L>
<L>To whom my Orders in these Words repeat:</L>
<L>Bid her this Miscreant with her sharpest Pains</L>
<L>Chastise, and sheath herself into his Veins;</L>
<L>Be unsubdu'd by Plenty's baffled Store,</L>
<L>Reject my Empire, and defeat my Pow'r.</L>

<L>Should with the Toil, and long Fatigue dismay,</L>
<L>Ascend my Chariot, and convey'd on high,</L>
<L>Guide the rein'd Dragons thro' the parting Sky.</L>
<L>The Nymph, accepting of the granted Carr,</L>
<L>Sprung to the Seat, and posted thro' the Air;</L>
<L>Nor stop'd till she to a bleak Mountain came</L>
<L>Of wondrous Height, and <HI>Caucasus</HI> its Name.</L>
<L>There in a stony Field the Fiend she found,</L>
<L>Herbs gnawing, and Roots scratching from the Ground.</L>
<L><PB N="293" REF="330"/>
Her Elfelock Hair in matted Tresses grew,</L>
<L>Sunk were her Eyes, and pale her ghastly Hue,</L>
<L>Wan were her Lips, and foul with clammy Glew.</L>
<L>Her Throat was furr'd, her Guts appear'd within</L>
<L>With snaky Crawlings thro' her Parchment Skin.</L>
<L>Her jutting Hips seem'd starting from their Place,</L>
<L>And for a Belly was a Belly's Space.</L>
<L>Her Dugs hung dangling from her craggy Spine,</L>
<L>Loose to her Breast, and fasten'd to her Chine.</L>
<L>Her Joints protuberant by Leanness grown,</L>
<L>Consumption sunk the Flesh, and rais'd the Bone.</L>
<L>Her Knees large Orbits bunch'd to monstrous Size,</L>
<L>And Ancles to undue Proportion rise.</L>
<L>This Plague the Nymph, not daring to draw near,</L>
<L>At Distance hail'd, and greeted from afar.</L>
<L>And tho' she told her Charge without Delay,</L>
<L>Tho' her Arrival late, and short her Stay,</L>
<L>She felt keen Famine, or she seem'd to feel,</L>
<L>Invade her Blood, and on her Vitals steal.</L>
<L>She turn'd from the Infection to remove,</L>
<L>And back to <HI>Thessaly</HI> the Serpents drove.</L>
<L>The Fiend obey'd the Goddess's Command,</L>
<L>(Tho' their Effects in Opposition stand)</L>
<L>She cut her Way, supported by the Wind,</L>
<L>And reach'd the Mansion by the Nymph assign'd.</L>
<L>'Twas Night, when entring <HI>Erisichthon</HI>'s Room,</L>
<L>Dissolv'd in Sleep, and thoughtless of his Doom,</L>
<L>She clasp'd his Limbs, by impious Labour tir'd,</L>
<L>With battish Wings, but her whole self inspir'd;</L>
<L>Breath'd on his Throat and Chest a tainting Blast,</L>
<L>And in his Veins infus'd an endless Fast.</L>
<L>The Task dispatch'd, away the Fury flies</L>
<L>From plenteous Regions, and from rip'ning Skies;</L>
<L><PB N="294" REF="331"/>
To her old barren North she wings her Speed,</L>
<L>And Cottages distress'd with pinching Need.</L>
<L>Still Slumbers <HI>Erisichthon</HI>'s Senses drown,</L>
<L>And sooth his Fancy with their softest Down.</L>
<L>He dreams of Viands delicate to eat,</L>
<L>And revels on imaginary Meat.</L>
<L>Chaws with his working Mouth, but chaws in vain,</L>
<L>And tires his grinding Teeth with fruitless Pain;</L>
<L>Deludes his Throat with visionary Fare,</L>
<L>Feasts on the Wind, and banquets on the Air.</L>
<L>The Morning came, the Night and Slumbers past,</L>
<L>But still the furious Pangs of Hunger last;</L>
<L>The cank'rous Rage still gnaws with griping Pains,</L>
<L>Stings in his Throat, and in his Bowels reigns.</L>
<L>Strait he requires, impatient in Demand,</L>
<L>Provisions from the Air, the Seas, the Land.</L>
<L>But tho' the Land, Air, Seas Provisions grant,</L>
<L>Starves at full Tables, and complains of Want.</L>
<L>What to a People might in Dole be paid,</L>
<L>Or victual Cities for a long Blockade,</L>
<L>Could not one Wolfish Appetite asswage,</L>
<L>For glutting Nourishment increas'd its Rage.</L>
<L>As Rivers pour'd from ev'ry distant Shore,</L>
<L>The Sea insatiate drinks, and thirsts for more;</L>
<L>Or as the Fire, which all Materials burns,</L>
<L>And wasted Forests into Ashes turns,</L>
<L>Grows more voracious, as the more it preys,</L>
<L>Recruits dilate the Flame, and spread the Blaze;</L>
<L>So impious <HI>Erisichthon</HI>'s Hunger raves,</L>
<L>Receives Refreshments, and Refreshments craves.</L>
<L>Food raises a Desire for Food, and Meat</L>
<L>Is but a new Provocative to eat.</L>

<L>A Daughter worthy of a better Sire:</L>
<L>Her too he sold, spent Nature to sustain;</L>

<L>His Muscles with a furious Bite he tore,</L>
<L>Gorg'd his own tatter'd Flesh, and gulph'd his Gore.</L>
<L>Wounds were his Feast, his Life to Life a Prey,</L>

<L>I too my self can to new Forms translate,</L>

<L>Not distant far a watry Lotos grows;</L>
<L>The Spring was new, and all the verdant Boughs,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with Blossoms, promis'd Fruits that vye</L>
<L>In glowing Colours with the <HI>Tyrian</HI> Dye.</L>
<L>Of these she cropt, to please her Infant Son,</L>

<L>The violated Blossoms drop with Blood;</L>

<L><HI>Lotis</HI> the Nymph (if rural Tales be true)</L>
<L>As from <HI>Priapus</HI>' lawless Lust she flew,</L>
<L>Forsook her Form; and fixing here, became</L>
<L>A flow'ry Plant, which still preserves her Name.</L>
<L>This Change unknown, astonish'd at the Sight,</L>
<L>My trembling Sister strove to urge her Flight;</L>
<L>Yet first the Pardon of the <HI>Nymphs</HI> implor'd,</L>
<L>And those offended <HI>Sylvan</HI> Pow'rs ador'd:</L>
<L>But when she backward would have fled, she found</L>
<L>Her stiff'ning Feet were rooted to the Ground:</L>
<L>In vain to free her fasten'd Feet she strove,</L>
<L>And as she struggles, only moves above;</L>
<L><PB N="312" REF="350"/>
She feels th' incroaching Bark around her grow,</L>
<L>By slow Degrees, and cover all below:</L>
<L>Surpris'd at this, her trembling Hand she heaves</L>
<L>To rend her Hair; her Hand is fill'd with Leaves;</L>
<L>Where late was Hair, the shooting Leaves are seen</L>
<L>To rise, and shade her with a sudden Green.</L>
<L>The Child <HI>Amphisus,</HI> to her Bosom prest,</L>
<L>Perceiv'd a colder and a harder Breast,</L>
<L>And found the Springs, that ne'er 'till then deny'd</L>
<L>Their milky Moisture, on a sudden dry'd.</L>
<L>I saw, unhappy, what I now relate,</L>
<L>And stood the helpless Witness of thy Fate;</L>
<L>Embrac'd thy Boughs, the rising Bark delay'd,</L>
<L>There wish'd to grow, and mingle Shade with Shade.</L>
<L>Behold <HI>Andraemon</HI> and th' unhappy Sire</L>
<L>Appear, and for their <HI>Dryopè</HI> enquire;</L>
<L>A springing Tree for <HI>Dryopè</HI> they find,</L>
<L>And print warm Kisses on the panting Rind;</L>
<L>Prostrate, with Tears their Kindred Plant bedew,</L>
<L>And close embrac'd, as to the Roots they grew.</L>
<L>The Face was all that now remain'd of thee;</L>
<L>No more a Woman, nor yet quite a Tree:</L>
<L>Thy Branches hung with humid Pearls appear,</L>
<L>From ev'ry Leaf distills a trickling Tear;</L>
<L>And strait a Voice, while yet a Voice remains,</L>
<L>Thus thro' the trembling Boughs in Sighs complains.</L>
<L>If to the Wretched any Faith be giv'n,</L>
<L>I swear by all th' unpitying Pow'rs of Heav'n,</L>
<L>No wilful Crime this heavy Vengeance bred,</L>
<L>In mutual Innocence our Lives we led.</L>

If this be false, let these new Greens decay,</L>
<L>Let sounding Axes lop my Limbs away,</L>

<L>Let some kind Nurse supply a Mother's Care;</L>
<L>Yet to his Mother let him oft be led,</L>
<L>Sport in her Shades, and in her Shades be fed;</L>
<L>Teach him, when first his Infant Voice shall frame</L>
<L>Imperfect Words, and lisp his Mother's Name,</L>
<L>To hail this Tree, and say with weeping Eyes,</L>
<L>Within this Plant my hapless Parent lies;</L>
<L>And when in Youth he seeks the shady Woods,</L>
<L>Oh, let him fly the chrystal Lakes and Floods,</L>
<L>Nor touch the fatal Flow'rs; but warn'd by me,</L>
<L>Believe a Goddess shrin'd in ev'ry Tree.</L>
<L>My Sire, my Sister, and my Spouse farewel!</L>
<L>If in your Breasts or Love or Pity dwell,</L>
<L>Protect your Plant, nor let my Branches feel</L>
<L>The browzing Cattle, or the piercing Steel.</L>
<L>Farewel! and since I cannot bend to join</L>
<L>My Lips to yours, advance at least to mine.</L>
<L>My Son, thy Mother's parting Kiss receive,</L>
<L>While yet thy Mother has a Kiss to give.</L>
<L>I can no more; the creeping Rind invades</L>
<L>My closing Lips, and hides my Head in Shades:</L>
<L>Remove your Hands; the Bark shall soon suffice,</L>
<L>Without their Aid, to seal these dying Eyes.</L>
<L>She ceas'd at once to speak, and ceas'd to be;</L>
<L>And all the Nymph was lost within the Tree:</L>
<L>Yet latent Life thro' her new Branches reign'd,</L>
<L>And long the Plant a human Heat retain'd.</L>

<HEAD>The Passion of BYBLIS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN HARVEY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></BYLINE>
<L>Let the sad Fate of wretched <HI>Byblis</HI> prove</L>
<L>A dismal Warning to unlawful Love;</L>
<L>One Birth gave Being to the hapless Pair,</L>
<L>But more was <HI>Caunus</HI> than a Sister's Care;</L>
<L>Unknown she lov'd, for yet the gentle Fire</L>
<L>Rose not in Flames, nor kindled to Desire;</L>
<L>'Twas thought no Sin to wonder at his Charms,</L>
<L>Hang on his Neck, and languish in his Arms;</L>
<L>Thus wing'd with Joy, fled the soft Hours away,</L>
<L>And all the fatal Guilt on harmless Nature lay.</L>
<L>But Love (too soon from Piety declin'd)</L>
<L>Insensibly deprav'd her yielding Mind.</L>
<L>Dress'd she appears, with nicest Art adorn'd,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Youth, but her lov'd Brother, scorn'd;</L>
<L><PB N="317" REF="355"/>
For him alone she labour'd to be fair,</L>
<L>And curst all Charms that might with hers compare.</L>
<L>'Twas she, and only she, must <HI>Caunus</HI> please,</L>
<L>Sick at her Heart, yet knew not her Disease:</L>
<L>She call'd him Lord, for Brother was a Name</L>
<L>Too cold, and dull for her aspiring Flame;</L>
<L>And when he spoke, if Sister, he reply'd,</L>
<L>For <HI>Byblis</HI> change that frozen Word, she cry'd;</L>
<L>Yet waking still she watch'd her strugling Breast,</L>
<L>And Love's Approaches were in vain address'd,</L>
<L>Till gentle Sleep an easy Conquest made,</L>
<L>And in her soft Embrace the Conqueror was laid.</L>
<L>But oh too soon the pleasing Vision fled,</L>
<L>And left her blushing on the conscious Bed:</L>
<L>Ah me! (she cry'd) how monstrous do I seem?</L>
<L>Why these wild Thoughts? and this incestuous Dream?</L>
<L>Envy herself ('tis true) must own his Charms,</L>
<L>But what is Beauty in a Sister's Arms?</L>
<L>Oh were I not that despicable she,</L>
<L>How bless'd, how pleas'd, how happy shou'd I be!</L>
<L>But unregarded now must bear my Pain,</L>
<L>And, but in Dreams, my Wishes can obtain.</L>
<L>O Sea-born Goddess! with thy wanton Boy!</L>
<L>Was ever such a charming Scene of Joy?</L>
<L>Such perfect Bliss! such ravishing Delight!</L>
<L>Ne'er hid before in the kind Shades of Night.</L>
<L>How pleas'd my Heart! in what sweet Raptures tost?</L>
<L>Ev'n Life itself in the soft Combat lost,</L>
<L>While breathless he on my heav'd Bosom lay,</L>
<L>And snatch'd the Treasures of my Soul away.</L>
<L>If the bare Fancy so affects my Mind,</L>
<L>How shou'd I rave if to the Substance join'd?</L>
<L><PB N="318" REF="356"/>
Oh, gentle <HI>Caunus!</HI> quit thy hated Line,</L>
<L>Or let thy Parents be no longer mine!</L>
<L>Oh that in common all things were enjoy'd,</L>
<L>But those alone who have our Hopes destroy'd.</L>
<L>Were I a Princess, thou an humble Swain,</L>
<L>The proudest Kings shou'd rival thee in vain.</L>
<L>It cannot be, alas! the dreadful Ill</L>
<L>Is fix'd by Fate, and he's my Brother still.</L>
<L>Hear me, ye Gods! I must have Friends in Heav'n,</L>
<L>For <HI>Jove</HI> himself was to a Sister giv'n:</L>
<L>But what are their Prerogatives above,</L>
<L>To the short Liberties of humane Love?</L>
<L>Fantastick Thoughts! down, down, forbidden Fires,</L>
<L>Or instant Death extinguish my Desires,</L>
<L>Strict Virtue, then, with thy malicious Leave,</L>
<L>Without a Crime I may a Kiss receive:</L>
<L>But say shou'd I in spight of Laws comply,</L>
<L>Yet cruel <HI>Caunus</HI> might himself deny,</L>
<L>No Pity take of an afflicted Maid,</L>
<L>(For Love's sweet Game must be by Couples play'd.)</L>
<L>Yet why shou'd Youth and Charms like mine despair?</L>
<L>Such Fears ne'er startled the <HI>Aeolian</HI> Pair;</L>
<L>No Ties of Blood could their full Hopes destroy,</L>
<L>They broke thro' all for the prevailing Joy;</L>
<L>And who can tell but <HI>Caunus</HI> too may be</L>
<L>Rack'd and tormented in his Breast for me?</L>
<L>Like me, to the extreamest Anguish drove,</L>
<L>Like me, just waking from a Dream of Love?</L>
<L>But stay! Oh whither wou'd my Fury run!</L>
<L>What Arguments I urge to be undone!</L>
<L>Away fond <HI>Byblis,</HI> quench these guilty Flames;</L>
<L><HI>Caunus</HI> thy Love but as a Brother claims;</L>
<L><PB N="319" REF="357"/>
Yet had he first been touch'd with Love of me,</L>
<L>The charming Youth cou'd I despairing see?</L>
<L>Oppress'd with Grief, and dying by Disdain?</L>
<L>Ah no! too sure I shou'd have eas'd his Pain?</L>
<L>Since then, if <HI>Caunus</HI> ask'd me, it were done;</L>
<L>Asking my self, what Dangers can I run?</L>
<L>But canst thou ask? and see that Right betray'd,</L>
<L>From <HI>Pyrrha</HI> down to thy whole Sex convey'd?</L>
<L>That self-denying Gift we all enjoy,</L>
<L>Of wishing to be won, yet seeming to be coy.</L>
<L>Well then, for once, let a fond Mistress woe,</L>
<L>The Force of Love no Custom can subdue;</L>
<L>This frantick Passion he by Words shall know,</L>
<L>Soft as the melting Heart from whence they flow.</L>
<L>The Pencil then in her fair Hand she held,</L>
<L>By Fear discourag'd, but by Love compell'd;</L>
<L>She writes, then blots, writes on, and blots again,</L>
<L>Likes it as fit, then razes it as vain:</L>
<L>Shame and Assurance in her Face appear,</L>
<L>And a faint Hope just yielding to Despair;</L>
<L>Sister was wrote, and blotted as a Word</L>
<L>Which she, and <HI>Caunus</HI> too (she hop'd) abhorr'd;</L>
<L>But now resolv'd to be no more controul'd</L>
<L>By scrup'lous Virtue, thus her Grief she told.</L>
<L>Thy Lover (gentle <HI>Caunus</HI>) wishes thee</L>
<L>That Health, which thou alone canst give to me.</L>
<L>O charming Youth, the Gift I ask bestow,</L>
<L>E're thou the Name of the fond Writer know;</L>
<L>To thee without a Name I would be known,</L>
<L>Since knowing that, my Frailty I must own.</L>
<L>Yet why shou'd I my wretched Name conceal?</L>
<L>When thousand Instances my Flames reveal▪</L>
<L><PB N="320" REF="358"/>
Wan Looks and weeping Eyes have spoke my Pain,</L>
<L>And Sighs discharg'd from my heav'd Heart in vain;</L>
<L>Had I not wish'd my Passion might be seen,</L>
<L>What cou'd such Fondness and Embraces mean?</L>
<L>Such Kisses too! (Oh heedless lovely Boy)</L>
<L>Without a Crime no Sister cou'd enjoy:</L>
<L>Yet (tho' extreamest Rage has rack'd my Soul,</L>
<L>And raging Fires in my parch'd Bosom roul)</L>
<L>Be Witness, Gods! how piously I strove,</L>
<L>To rid my Thoughts of this enchanting Love.</L>
<L>But who cou'd scape so fierce and sure a Dart,</L>
<L>Aim'd at a tender and defenceless Heart?</L>
<L>Alas! what Maid cou'd suffer I have born,</L>
<L>E're the dire Secret from my Breast was torn;</L>
<L>To thee a helpless vanquish'd Wretch I come,</L>
<L>'Tis you alone can save, or give my Doom;</L>
<L>My Life or Death this Moment you may chuse,</L>
<L>Yet think, Oh think, no hated Stranger sues,</L>
<L>No Foe, but one, alas! too near ally'd,</L>
<L>And wishing still much nearer to be ty'd.</L>
<L>The Forms of Decency let Age debate,</L>
<L>And Virtue's Rules by their cold Morals state;</L>
<L>Their ebbing Joys give Leisure to enquire,</L>
<L>And blame those noble Flights our Youth inspire:</L>
<L>Where Nature kindly summons let us go,</L>
<L>Our sprightly Years no Bounds in Love shou'd know,</L>
<L>Shou'd feel no Check of Guilt, and fear no Ill;</L>
<L>Lovers and Gods act all things at their Will:</L>
<L>We gain one Blessing from our hated Kin,</L>
<L>Since our Paternal Freedom hides the Sin;</L>
<L>Uncensur'd in each others Arms we lye,</L>
<L>Think then how easy to compleat our Joy.</L>
<L><PB N="321" REF="359"/>
Oh pardon, and oblige a blushing Maid,</L>
<L>Whose Rage the Pride of her vain Sex betray'd;</L>
<L>Nor let my Tomb thus mournfully complain,</L>
<L>Here <HI>Byblis</HI> lies, by her lov'd <HI>Caunus</HI> slain.</L>
<L>Forc'd here to end, she with a falling Tear</L>
<L>Temper'd the pliant Wax, which did the Signet bear:</L>
<L>The curious Cypher was impress'd by Art,</L>
<L>But Love had stamp'd one deeper in her Heart;</L>
<L>Her Page, a Youth of Confidence and Skill,</L>
<L>(Secret as Night) stood waiting on her Will;</L>
<L>Sighing (she cry'd) bear this, thou faithful Boy,</L>
<L>To my sweet Part'ner in eternal Joy:</L>
<L>Here a long Pause her secret Guilt confess'd,</L>
<L>And when at length she wou'd have spoke the rest,</L>
<L>Half the dear Name lay bury'd in her Breast.</L>
<L>Thus as he listned to her vain Command,</L>
<L>Down fell the Letter from her trembling Hand.</L>
<L>The Omen shock'd her Soul: Yet go, she cry'd;</L>
<L>Can a Request from <HI>Byblis</HI> be deny'd?</L>
<L>To the <HI>Maeandrian</HI> Youth's this Message born,</L>
<L>The half-read Lines by his fierce Rage were torn;</L>
<L>Hence, hence, he cry'd, thou Pandar to her Lust,</L>
<L>Bear hence the Triumph of thy impious Trust:</L>
<L>Thy instant Death will but divulge her Shame,</L>
<L>Or thy Life's Blood shou'd quench the guilty Flame.</L>
<L>Frighted, from threatning <HI>Caunus</HI> he withdrew,</L>
<L>And with the dreadful News to his lost Mistress flew</L>
<L>The sad Repulse so struck the wounded Fair,</L>
<L>Her Sense was buried in her wild Despair;</L>
<L>Pale was her Visage, as the ghastly Dead,</L>
<L>And her scar'd Soul from the sweet Mansion fled;</L>
<L><PB N="322" REF="360"/>
Yet with her Life renew'd, her Love returns,</L>
<L>And faintly thus her cruel Fate she mourns:</L>
<L>'Tis just, ye Gods! was my false Reason blind?</L>
<L>To write a Secret of this tender kind?</L>
<L>With female Craft I shou'd at first have strove,</L>
<L>By dubious Hints to sound his distant Love;</L>
<L>And try'd those useful, tho' dissembled, Arts</L>
<L>Which Women practise on disdainful Hearts:</L>
<L>I shou'd have watch'd whence the black Storm might rise,</L>
<L>E're I had trusted the unfaithful Skies.</L>
<L>Now on the rouling Billows I am tost,</L>
<L>And with extended Sails, on the blind Shelves am lost.</L>
<L>Did not indulgent Heav'n my Doom foretell,</L>
<L>When from my Hand the fatal Letter fell?</L>
<L>What Madness seiz'd my Soul? and urg'd me on</L>
<L>To take the only Course to be undone?</L>
<L>I cou'd my self have told the moving Tale</L>
<L>With such alluring Grace as must prevail;</L>
<L>Then had his Eyes beheld my blushing Fears,</L>
<L>My rising Sighs, and my descending Tears;</L>
<L>Round his dear Neck these Arms I then had spread,</L>
<L>And, if rejected, at his Feet been dead:</L>
<L>If singly these had not his Thoughts inclin'd,</L>
<L>Yet all united wou'd have shock'd his Mind.</L>
<L>Perhaps, my careless Page might be in fault,</L>
<L>And in a luckless Hour the fatal Message brought;</L>
<L>Business, and worldly Thoughts might fill his Breast,</L>
<L>Sometimes ev'n Love itself may be an irksome Guest:</L>
<L>He cou'd not else have treated me with Scorn,</L>
<L>For <HI>Caunus</HI> was not of a Tygress born;</L>
<L>Nor Steel nor Adamant has fenc'd his Heart,</L>
<L>Like mine 'tis naked to the burning Dart.</L>
<L><PB N="323" REF="361"/>
Away false Fears! he must, he shall be mine,</L>
<L>In Death alone I will my Claim resign;</L>
<L>'Tis vain to wish my written Crime unknown,</L>
<L>And for my Guilt much vainer to attone.</L>
<L>Repuls'd, and baffled, fiercer still she burns,</L>
<L>And <HI>Caunus</HI> with Disdain her impious Love returns.</L>
<L>He saw no End of her injurious Flame,</L>
<L>And fled his Country to avoid the Shame.</L>
<L>Forsaken <HI>Byblis,</HI> who had Hopes no more,</L>
<L>Burst out in Rage, and her loose Robes she tore;</L>
<L>With her fair Hands she smote her tender Breast,</L>
<L>And to the wondring World her Love confess'd;</L>
<L>O'er Hills and Dales, o'er Rocks and Streams she flew,</L>
<L>But still in vain did her wild Lust pursue:</L>
<L>Wearied at length, on the cold Earth she fell,</L>
<L>And now in Tears alone cou'd her sad Story tell.</L>
<L>Relenting Gods, in Pity, fix'd her there,</L>

<L>Of so great Charges, and so little Use,</L>
<L>(Bear witness, Heav'n, with what Reluctancy)</L>
<L>Her hapless Innocence I doom to dye.</L>
<L>He said, and Tears the common Grief display,</L>
<L>Of him who bad, and her who must obey.</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Telethusa</HI> still persists, to find</L>
<L>Fit Arguments to move a Father's Mind;</L>
<L>T' extend his Wishes to a larger Scope,</L>
<L>And in one Vessel not confine his Hope.</L>
<L><HI>Lygdus</HI> continues hard: Her Time drew near,</L>
<L>And she her heavy Load cou'd scarcely bear;</L>
<L>When, slumb'ring, in the latter Shades of Night,</L>
<L>Before th' Approaches of returning Light,</L>
<L>She saw, or thought she saw, before her Bed,</L>
<L>A glorious Train, and <HI>Isis</HI> at their Head:</L>
<L>Her moony Horns were on her Forehead plac'd,</L>
<L>And yellow Sheaves her shining Temples grac'd:</L>
<L>A Mitre, for a Crown, she wore on high;</L>
<L>The Dog and dappl'd Bull were waiting by;</L>
<L><HI>Osyris,</HI> sought along the Banks of <HI>Nile</HI>;</L>
<L>The silent God; the sacred Crocodile:</L>
<L>And, last, a long Procession moving on,</L>
<L>With Timbrels, that assist the lab'ring Moon.</L>
<L>Her Slumbers seem'd dispell'd, and, broad awake,</L>
<L>She heard a Voice, that thus distinctly spake.</L>
<L>My Votary, thy Babe from Death defend,</L>
<L>Nor fear to save whate'er the Gods will send.</L>
<L><PB N="325" REF="363"/>
Delude with Art thy Husband's dire Decree;</L>
<L>When Danger calls, repose thy Trust on me:</L>
<L>And know thou hast not serv'd a thankless Deity.</L>
<L>This Promise made, with Night the Goddess fled;</L>
<L>With Joy the Woman wakes, and leaves her Bed;</L>
<L>Devoutly lifts her spotless Hands on high,</L>
<L>And prays the Pow'rs their Gift to ratifie.</L>
<L>Now grinding Pains proceed to bearing Throws,</L>
<L>Till its own Weight the Burden did disclose.</L>
<L>'Twas of the beauteous Kind, and brought to Light</L>
<L>With Secrecy, to shun the Father's Sight.</L>
<L>Th' indulgent Mother did her Care employ,</L>
<L>And pass'd it on her Husband for a Boy.</L>
<L>The Nurse was conscious of the Fact alone;</L>
<L>The Father paid his Vows as for a Son;</L>
<L>And call'd him <HI>Iphis,</HI> by a common Name,</L>
<L>Which either Sex with equal Right may claim.</L>
<L><HI>Iphis</HI> his Grandsire was; the Wife was pleas'd,</L>
<L>Of half the Fraud by Fortune's Favour eas'd:</L>
<L>The doubtful Name was us'd without Deceit,</L>
<L>And Truth was cover'd with a pious Cheat.</L>
<L>The Habit shew'd a Boy, the beauteous Face</L>
<L>With manly Fierceness mingl'd female Grace.</L>
<L>Now thirteen Years of Age were swiftly run,</L>
<L>When the fond Father thought the time drew on</L>
<L>Of settling in the World his only Son.</L>
<L><HI>Ianthe</HI> was his Choice; so wondrous fair,</L>
<L>Her Form alone with <HI>Iphis</HI> cou'd compare;</L>
<L>A Neighbour's Daughter of his own Degree,</L>
<L>And not more bless'd with Fortune's Goods than he.</L>
<L>They soon espous'd; for they with Ease were join'd,</L>
<L>Who were before contracted in the Mind.</L>
<L><PB N="326" REF="364"/>
Their Age the same, their Inclinations too;</L>
<L>And bred together, in one School they grew.</L>
<L>Thus, fatally dispos'd to mutual Fires,</L>
<L>They felt, before they knew, the same Desires.</L>
<L>Equal their Flame, unequal was their Care;</L>
<L>One lov'd with Hope, one languish'd in Despair.</L>
<L>The Maid accus'd the ling'ring Days alone:</L>
<L>For whom she thought a Man, she thought her own.</L>
<L>But <HI>Iphis</HI> bends beneath a greater Grief;</L>
<L>As fiercely burns, but hopes for no Relief.</L>
<L>Ev'n her Despair adds Fuel to her Fire;</L>
<L>A Maid with Madness does a Maid desire.</L>
<L>And, scarce refraining Tears, Alas, said she,</L>
<L>What Issue of my Love remains for me!</L>
<L>How wild a Passion works within my Breast,</L>
<L>With what prodigious Flames am I possest!</L>
<L>Cou'd I the Care of Providence deserve,</L>
<L>Heav'n must destroy me, if it wou'd preserve.</L>
<L>And that's my Fate; or sure it wou'd have sent</L>
<L>Some usual Evil for my Punishment:</L>
<L>Not this unkindly Curse; to rage and burn,</L>
<L>Where Nature shews no Prospect of Return.</L>
<L>Nor Cows for Cows consume with fruitless Fire,</L>
<L>Nor Mares, when hot, their Fellow-Mares desire:</L>
<L>The Father of the Fold supplies his Ewes;</L>
<L>The Stag through secret Woods his Hind pursues;</L>
<L>And Birds for Mates the Males of their own Species chuse.</L>
<L>Her Females Nature guards from Female Flame,</L>
<L>And joins two Sexes to preserve the Game:</L>
<L>Wou'd I were nothing, or not what I am!</L>
<L><HI>Crete,</HI> fam'd for Monsters, wanted of her Store,</L>
<L>Till my new Love produc'd one Monster more.</L>
<L><PB N="327" REF="365"/>
The Daughter of the Sun a Bull desir'd,</L>
<L>And yet ev'n then a Male a Female fir'd:</L>
<L>Her Passion was extravagantly new,</L>
<L>But mine is much the madder of the two.</L>
<L>To things impossible she was not bent,</L>
<L>But found the Means to compass her Intent.</L>
<L>To cheat his Eyes she took a different Shape;</L>
<L>Yet still she gain'd a Lover and a Leap.</L>
<L>Shou'd all the Wit of all the World conspire,</L>
<L>Shou'd <HI>Daedalus</HI> assist my wild Desire,</L>
<L>What Art can make me able to enjoy,</L>
<L>Or what can change <HI>Ianthe</HI> to a Boy?</L>
<L>Extinguish then thy Passion, hopeless Maid,</L>
<L>And recollect thy Reason for thy Aid.</L>
<L>Know what thou art, and love as Maidens ought,</L>
<L>And drive these Golden Wishes from thy Thought.</L>
<L>Thou canst not hope thy fond Desires to gain;</L>
<L>Where Hope is wanting, Wishes are in vain.</L>
<L>And yet no Guards against our Joys conspire;</L>
<L>No jealous Husband hinders our Desire:</L>
<L>My Parents are propitious to my Wish,</L>
<L>And she herself consenting to the Bliss.</L>
<L>All things concur to prosper our Design;</L>
<L>All things to prosper any Love but mine.</L>
<L>And yet I never can enjoy the Fair;</L>
<L>'Tis past the Pow'r of Heav'n to grant my Pray'r.</L>
<L>Heav'n has been kind, as far as Heav'n can be;</L>
<L>Our Parents with our own Desires agree;</L>
<L>But Nature, stronger than the Gods above,</L>
<L>Refuses her Assistance to my Love;</L>
<L>She sets the Bar that causes all my Pain;</L>
<L>One Gift refus'd, makes all their Bounty vain.</L>
<L><PB N="328" REF="366"/>
And now the happy Day is just at hand,</L>
<L>To bind our Hearts in <HI>Hymen</HI>'s holy Band:</L>
<L>Our Hearts, but not our Bodies: Thus accurs'd,</L>
<L>In midst of Water I complain of Thirst.</L>
<L>Why com'st thou, <HI>Juno,</HI> to these barren Rites,</L>
<L>To bless a Bed defrauded of Delights?</L>
<L>But why shou'd <HI>Hymen</HI> lift his Torch on high,</L>
<L>To see two Brides in cold Embraces lye?</L>
<L>Thus Love-sick <HI>Iphis</HI> her vain Passion mourns;</L>
<L>With equal Ardour fair <HI>Ianthe</HI> burns,</L>
<L>Invoking <HI>Hymen</HI>'s Name and <HI>Juno</HI>'s Pow'r,</L>
<L>To speed the Work, and haste the happy Hour.</L>
<L>She hopes, while <HI>Telethusa</HI> fears the Day,</L>
<L>And strives to interpose some new Delay:</L>
<L>Now feigns a Sickness, now is in a Fright</L>
<L>For this bad Omen, or that boding Sight.</L>
<L>But having done whate'er she cou'd devise,</L>
<L>And empty'd all her Magazine of Lies,</L>
<L>The Time approach'd; the next ensuing Day</L>
<L>The fatal Secret must to Light betray.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Telethusa</HI> had recourse to Pray'r,</L>
<L>She, and her Daughter with dishevell'd Hair;</L>
<L>Trembling with Fear, great <HI>Isis</HI> they ador'd,</L>
<L>Embrac'd her Altar, and her Aid implor'd.</L>
<L>Fair Queen, who dost on fruitful <HI>Egypt</HI> smile,</L>
<L>Who sway'st the Sceptre of the <HI>Pharian</HI> Isle,</L>
<L>And sev'n-fold Falls of disemboguing <HI>Nile</HI>;</L>
<L>Relieve, in this our last Distress, she said,</L>
<L>A suppliant Mother, and a mournful Maid.</L>
<L>Thou, Goddess, thou wert present to my Sight;</L>
<L>Reveal'd I saw thee, by thy own fair Light:</L>
<L><PB N="329" REF="367"/>
I saw thee in my Dream, as now I see,</L>
<L>With all thy Marks of awful Majesty:</L>
<L>The glorious Train that compass'd thee around;</L>
<L>And heard the hollow Timbrels holy Sound.</L>
<L>Thy Words I noted, which I still retain;</L>
<L>Let not thy sacred Oracles be vain.</L>
<L>That <HI>Iphis</HI> lives, that I my self am free</L>
<L>From Shame and Punishment, I owe to thee.</L>
<L>On thy Protection all our Hopes depend:</L>
<L>Thy Counsel sav'd us, let thy Pow'r defend.</L>
<L>Her Tears pursu'd her Words; and while she spoke</L>
<L>The Goddess nodded, and her Altar shook:</L>
<L>The Temple Doors, as with a Blast of Wind,</L>
<L>Were heard to clap; the Lunar Horns that bind</L>
<L>The Brows of <HI>Isis,</HI> cast a Blaze around;</L>
<L>The trembling Timbrel made a murm'ring Sound.</L>
<L>Some Hopes these happy Omens did impart;</L>
<L>Forth went the Mother with a beating Heart:</L>
<L>Not much in Fear, nor fully satisfy'd;</L>
<L>But <HI>Iphis</HI> follow'd with a larger Stride:</L>
<L>The Whiteness of her Skin forsook her Face;</L>
<L>Her Looks embolden'd, with an awful Grace;</L>
<L>Her Features and her Strength together grew,</L>
<L>And her long Hair to curling Locks withdrew.</L>
<L>Her sparkling Eyes with manly Vigour shone,</L>
<L>Big was her Voice, audacious was her Tone.</L>
<L>The latent Parts, at length reveal'd, began</L>
<L>To shoot, and spread, and burnish into Man.</L>
<L>The Maid becomes a Youth; no more delay</L>
<L>Your Vows, but look, and confidently pay.</L>
<L>Their Gifts the Parents to the Temple bear:</L>
<L>The Votive Tables this Inscription wear;</L>
<L><PB N="330" REF="368"/>
<HI>Iphis</HI> the Man, has to the Goddess paid</L>
<L>The Vows that <HI>Iphis</HI> offer'd when a Maid.</L>
<L>Now when the Star of Day had shewn his Face,</L>
<L><HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Juno</HI> with their Presence grace</L>
<L>The Nuptial Rites, and <HI>Hymen</HI> from above</L>
<L>Descending to compleat their happy Love:</L>
<L>The Gods of Marriage lend their mutual Aid;</L>

<L><HI>Hymen</HI> departs, thro' Air's unmeasur'd Space;</L>

<L>But with ill-omen'd Augury descends;</L>
<L>Nor chearful look'd the God, nor prosp'rous spoke,</L>
<L>Nor blaz'd his Torch, but wept in hissing Smoke.</L>
<L>In vain they whirl it round, in vain they shake,</L>
<L>No rapid Motion can its Flames awake.</L>
<L>With Dread these inauspicious Signs were view'd,</L>
<L>And soon a more disastrous End ensu'd;</L>
<L>For as the Bride, amid the <HI>Naïad</HI> Train,</L>
<L>Ran joyful, sporting o'er the flow'ry Plain,</L>
<L>A venom'd Viper bit her as she pass'd;</L>
<L>Instant she fell, and suddain breath'd her last.</L>

When long his Loss the <HI>Thracian</HI> had deplor'd,</L>
<L>Not by superior Pow'rs to be restor'd;</L>
<L>Inflam'd by Love, and urg'd by deep Despair,</L>
<L>He leaves the Realms of Light, and upper Air;</L>
<L>Daring to tread the dark <HI>Tenarian</HI> Road,</L>
<L>And tempt the Shades in their obscure Abode;</L>
<L>Thro' gliding Spectres of th'Interr'd to go,</L>
<L>And Phantom People of the World below:</L>
<L><HI>Persephonè</HI> he seeks, and him who reigns</L>
<L>O'er Ghosts, and Hell's uncomfortable Plains.</L>
<L>Arriv'd, he, tuning to his Voice his Strings,</L>
<L>Thus to the King and Queen of Shadows sings.</L>
<L>Ye Pow'rs, who under Earth your Realms extend,</L>
<L>To whom all Mortals must one Day descend;</L>
<L>If here 'tis granted sacred Truth to tell:</L>
<L>I come not curious to explore your Hell;</L>
<L>Nor come to boast (by vain Ambition fir'd)</L>
<L>How <HI>Cerberus</HI> at my Approach retir'd.</L>
<L>My Wife alone I seek; for her lov'd sake</L>
<L>These Terrors I support, this Journey take.</L>
<L>She, luckless wandring, or by Fate mis-led,</L>
<L>Chanc'd on a lurking Viper's Crest to tread;</L>
<L>The vengeful Beast, enflam'd with Fury, starts,</L>
<L>And thro' her Heel his deathful Venom darts.</L>
<L>Thus was she snatch'd untimely to her Tomb;</L>
<L>Her growing Years cut short, and springing Bloom.</L>
<L>Long I my Loss endeavour'd to sustain,</L>
<L>And strongly strove, but strove, alas, in vain:</L>
<L>At length I yielded, won by mighty Love;</L>
<L>Well known is that Omnipotence above!</L>
<L>But here, I doubt, his unfelt Influence fails;</L>
<L>And yet a Hope within my Heart prevails,</L>
<L><PB N="333" REF="371"/>
That here, ev'n here, he has been known of old;</L>
<L>At least, if Truth be by Tradition told;</L>
<L>If Fame of former Rapes Belief may find,</L>
<L>You both by Love, and Love alone, were joyn'd.</L>
<L>Now, by the Horrors which these Realms surround;</L>
<L>By the vast Chaos of these Depths profound;</L>
<L>By the sad Silence which eternal reigns</L>
<L>O'er all the Waste of these wide-stretching Plains;</L>
<L>Let me again <HI>Eurydice</HI> receive,</L>
<L>Let Fate her quick-spun Thread of Life re-weave.</L>
<L>All our Possessions are but Loans from you,</L>
<L>And soon, or late, you must be paid your Due;</L>
<L>Hither we haste to Human-kind's last Seat,</L>
<L>Your endless Empire, and our sure Retreat.</L>
<L>She too, when ripen'd Years she shall attain,</L>
<L>Must, of avoidless Right, be yours again:</L>
<L>I but the transient use of that require,</L>
<L>Which soon, too soon, I must resign entire.</L>
<L>But if the Destinies refuse my Vow,</L>
<L>And no Remission of her Doom allow;</L>
<L>Know, I'm determin'd to return no more;</L>
<L>So both retain, or both to Life restore.</L>
<L>Thus, while the Bard melodiously complains,</L>
<L>And to his Lyre accords his vocal Strains,</L>
<L>The very bloodless Shades Attention keep,</L>
<L>And silent, seem compassionate to weep;</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Tantalus</HI> his Flood unthirsty views,</L>
<L>Nor flies the Stream, nor he the Stream pursues;</L>
<L><HI>Ixïon</HI>'s wondring Wheel its Whirl suspends,</L>
<L>And the voracious Vultur, charm'd, attends;</L>
<L>No mroe the <HI>Belides</HI> their Toil bemoan,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sisiphus</HI> reclin'd, sits list'ning on his Stone.</L>

Then first ('tis said) by sacred Verse subdu'd,</L>
<L>The Furies felt their Cheeks with Tears bedew'd:</L>
<L>Nor could the rigid King or Queen of Hell,</L>
<L>Th' Impulse of Pity in their Hearts, repell.</L>
<L>Now, from a Troop of Shades that last arriv'd,</L>
<L><HI>Eurydice</HI> was call'd, and stood reviv'd.</L>
<L>Slow she advanc'd, and halting seem'd to feel</L>
<L>The fatal Wound, yet painful in her Heel.</L>
<L>Thus he obtains the Suit so much desir'd,</L>
<L>On strict Observance of the Terms requir'd:</L>
<L>For if, before he reach the Realms of Air,</L>
<L>He backward cast his Eyes to view the Fair,</L>
<L>The forfeit Grant, that Instant, void is made,</L>
<L>And she for ever left a lifeless Shade.</L>
<L>Now thro' the noiseless Throng their Way they bend,</L>
<L>And both with Pain the rugged Road ascend;</L>
<L>Dark was the Path, and difficult, and steep,</L>
<L>And thick with Vapours from the smoaky Deep.</L>
<L>They well-nigh now had pass'd the Bounds of Night,</L>
<L>And just approach'd the Margin of the Light,</L>
<L>When, he mistrusting, lest her Steps might stray,</L>
<L>And gladsom of the Glimpse of dawning Day,</L>
<L>His longing Eyes, impatient, backward cast</L>
<L>To catch a Lover's Look, but look'd his last;</L>
<L>For, instant dying, she again descends,</L>
<L>While he to empty Air his Arms extends.</L>
<L>Again she dy'd, nor yet her Lord reprov'd;</L>
<L>What cou'd she say, but that too well he lov'd?</L>
<L>One last Farewel she spoke, which scarce he heard;</L>
<L>So soon she drop'd, so suddain disappear'd.</L>
<L>All stunn'd he stood, when thus his Wife he view'd</L>
<L>By second Fate and double Death subdu'd:</L>
<L><PB N="335" REF="373"/>
Not more Amazement by that Wretch was shown,</L>

<L>Nor <HI>Ollenus</HI> cou'd more astonish'd look,</L>
<L>When on himself <HI>Lethaea</HI>'s Fault he took,</L>
<L>His beauteous Wife, who too secure had dar'd</L>
<L>Her Face to vye with Goddesses compar'd:</L>
<L>Once join'd by Love, they stand united still,</L>
<L>Turn'd to contiguous Rocks, on <HI>Ida</HI>'s Hill.</L>
<L>Now to repass the <HI>Styx</HI> in vain he tries,</L>
<L><HI>Charon</HI> averse, his pressing Suit denies.</L>
<L>Seven Days entire, along th' infernal Shores,</L>
<L>Disconsolate, the Bard <HI>Eurydice</HI> deplores;</L>
<L>Defil'd with Filth his Robe, with Tears his Cheeks,</L>
<L>No Sustenance but Grief and Cares he seeks:</L>
<L>Of rigid Fate incessant he complains,</L>
<L>And Hell's inexorable Gods arraigns.</L>
<L>This ended, to high <HI>Rhodopé</HI> he hastes,</L>
<L>And <HI>Haemus</HI>' Mountain, bleek with Northern Blasts.</L>
<L>And now his yearly Race the circling Sun</L>
<L>Had thrice compleat thro' watry <HI>Pisces</HI> run,</L>

<L>And all soft Union with the Sex declin'd.</L>
<L>Whether his ill Success this Change had bred,</L>
<L>Or binding Vows made to his former Bed;</L>
<L>Whate'er the Cause, in vain the Nymphs contest,</L>
<L>With rival Eyes to warm his frozen Breast:</L>
<L>For ev'ry Nymph with Love his Lays inspir'd,</L>
<L>But ev'ry Nymph repuls'd, with Grief retir'd.</L>
<L>A Hill there was, and on that Hill a Mead,</L>

<L>Where, now, the Muse's Son no sooner sings,</L>
<L>No sooner strikes his sweet resounding Strings,</L>

But distant Groves the flying Sounds receive,</L>
<L>And listning Trees their rootes Stations leave;</L>
<L>Themselves transplanting, all around they grow,</L>

<L>Here, tall <HI>Chaönian</HI> Oaks their Branches spread,</L>

<L>Here, brittle Hazels, Lawrels here advance,</L>

<L>Here, Silver Firs with knotless Trunks ascend,</L>
<L>There, Scarlet Oaks beneath their Acorns bend.</L>
<L>That Spot admits the hospitable Plane,</L>
<L>On this, the Maple grows with clouded Grain;</L>
<L>Here, watry Willows are with <HI>Lotus</HI> seen,</L>
<L>There, Tamarisk, and Box for ever green.</L>
<L>With double Hue here Mirtles grace the Ground,</L>

<L>Wild <HI>Ornus</HI> now, the Pitch-tree next takes root,</L>

<HEAD>The Fable of CYPARISSUS.</HEAD>

A Tree, which once a Youth, and heav'nly fair,</L>
<L>Was of that Deity the darling Care,</L>
<L>Whose Hand adapts, with equal Skill, the Strings</L>
<L>To Bows with which he kills, and Harps to which he sings.</L>
<L>For, heretofore, a mighty Stag was bred,</L>
<L>Which on the fertile Fields of <HI>Caea</HI> fed;</L>
<L>In Shape and Size he all his Kind excell'd,</L>
<L>And to <HI>Carthaean</HI> Nymphs was sacred held.</L>
<L>His beamy Head, with Branches high display'd,</L>
<L>Afforded to itself an ample Shade;</L>
<L>His Horns were gilt, and his smooth Neck was grac'd</L>
<L>With Silver Collars thick with Gems enchas'd:</L>
<L>A Silver Boss upon his Forehead hung,</L>
<L>And brazen Pendants in his Ear-rings rung.</L>

Their God the <HI>Delphic</HI> Priests consult in vain;</L>

<L>O'er hanging Cliffs swift he pursues the Game;</L>
<L>Each Hour his Pleasure, each augments his Flame.</L>

<L>It cleft the Air, and whistled as it flew;</L>
<L>It reach'd the Mark, a most surprizing Length;</L>
<L>Which spoke an equal Share of Art, and Strength.</L>
<L>Scarce was it fall'n, when with too eager Hand</L>

<HEAD>The Story of PYGMALION, and the STATUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. DRYDEN.</BYLINE>
<L><HI>Pygmalion</HI> loathing their lascivious Life,</L>
<L>Abhorr'd all Womankind, but most a Wife:</L>
<L>So single chose to live, and shunn'd to wed,</L>
<L>Well pleas'd to want a Consort of his Bed.</L>
<L>Yet fearing Idleness, the Nurse of Ill,</L>
<L>In Sculpture exercis'd his happy Skill;</L>
<L>And carv'd in Iv'ry such a Maid, so fair,</L>
<L>As Nature could not with his Art compare,</L>
<L>Were she to work; but in her own Defence</L>
<L>Must take her Pattern here, and copy hence.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with his Idol, he commends, admires,</L>
<L>Adores; and last, the Thing ador'd, desires.</L>
<L>A very Virgin in her Face was seen,</L>
<L>And had she mov'd, a living Maid had been:</L>
<L>One wou'd have thought she cou'd have stirr'd, but strove</L>
<L>With Modesty, and was asham'd to move.</L>
<L>Art hid with Art, so well perform'd the Cheat,</L>
<L>It caught the Carver with his own Deceit:</L>
<L>He knows 'tis Madness, yet he must adore,</L>
<L>And still the more he knows it, loves the more:</L>
<L>The Flesh, or what so seems, he touches oft,</L>
<L>Which feels so smooth, that he believes it soft.</L>
<L>Fir'd with this Thought, at once he strain'd the Breast,</L>
<L>And on the Lips a burning Kiss impress'd.</L>
<L>'Tis true, the harden'd Breast resists the Gripe,</L>
<L>And the cold Lips return a Kiss unripe:</L>
<L>But when, retiring back, he look'd again,</L>
<L>To think it Iv'ry, was a Thought too mean:</L>
<L><PB N="344" REF="382"/>
So wou'd believe she kiss'd, and courting more,</L>
<L>Again embrac'd her naked Body o'er;</L>
<L>And straining hard the Statue, was afraid</L>
<L>His Hands had made a Dint, and hurt his Maid:</L>
<L>Explor'd her Limb by Limb, and fear'd to find</L>
<L>So rude a Gripe had left a livid Mark behind:</L>
<L>With Flatt'ry now he seeks her Mind to move,</L>
<L>And now with Gifts, (the pow'rful Bribes of Love:)</L>
<L>He furnishes her Closet first; and fills</L>
<L>The crowded Shelves with Rarities of Shells;</L>
<L>Adds Orient Pearls, which from the Conchs he drew,</L>
<L>And all the sparkling Stones of various Hue:</L>
<L>And Parrots, imitating Human Tongue,</L>
<L>And Singing-birds in Silver Cages hung;</L>
<L>And ev'ry fragrant Flow'r, and od'rous Green</L>
<L>Were sorted well, with Lumps of Amber laid between:</L>
<L>Rich fashionable Robes her Person deck,</L>
<L>Pendants her Ears, and Pearls adorn her Neck:</L>
<L>Her taper'd Fingers too with Rings are grac'd,</L>
<L>And an embroider'd Zone surrounds her slender Waste.</L>
<L>Thus like a Queen array'd, so richly dress'd,</L>
<L>Beauteous she shew'd, but naked shew'd the best.</L>
<L>Then, from the Floor, he rais'd a Royal Bed,</L>
<L>With Cov'rings of <HI>Sydonian</HI> Purple spread:</L>
<L>The solemn Rites perform'd, he calls her Bride,</L>
<L>With Blandishments invites her to his Side;</L>
<L>And as she were with vital Sense possess'd,</L>
<L>Her Head did on a plumy Pillow rest.</L>
<L>The Feast of <HI>Venus</HI> came, a solemn Day,</L>
<L>To which the <HI>Cypriots</HI> due Devotion pay;</L>
<L>With gilded Horns the Milk-white Heifers led,</L>
<L>Slaughter'd before the sacred Altars, bled:</L>
<L><PB N="345" REF="383"/>
<HI>Pygmalion</HI> off'ring, first, approach'd the Shrine,</L>
<L>And then with Pray'rs implor'd the Pow'rs Divine;</L>
<L>Almighty Gods, if all we Mortals want,</L>
<L>If all we can require, be yours to grant;</L>
<L>Make this fair Statue mine, he wou'd have said,</L>
<L>But chang'd his Words for Shame; and only pray'd,</L>
<L>Give me the Likeness of my Iv'ry Maid.</L>
<L>The Golden Goddess, present at the Pray'r,</L>
<L>Well knew he meant th' inanimated Fair,</L>
<L>And gave the Sign of granting his Desire;</L>
<L>For thrice in chearful Flames ascends the Fire.</L>
<L>The Youth, returning to his Mistress, hies,</L>
<L>And impudent in Hope, with ardent Eyes,</L>
<L>And beating Breast, by the dear Statue lies.</L>
<L>He kisses her white Lips, renews the Bliss,</L>
<L>And looks, and thinks they redden at the Kiss;</L>
<L>He thought them warm before: Nor longer stays,</L>
<L>But next his Hand on her hard Bosom lays:</L>
<L>Hard as it was, beginning to relent,</L>
<L>It seem'd, the Breast beneath his Fingers bent;</L>
<L>He felt again, his Fingers made a Print,</L>
<L>'Twas Flesh, but Flesh so firm, it rose against the Dint:</L>
<L>The pleasing Task he fails not to renew;</L>
<L>Soft, and more soft at ev'ry Touch it grew;</L>
<L>Like pliant Wax, when chafing Hands reduce</L>
<L>The former Mass to Form, and frame for Use.</L>
<L>He would believe, but yet is still in Pain,</L>
<L>And tries his Argument of Sense again,</L>
<L>Presses the Pulse, and feels the leaping Vein.</L>
<L>Convinc'd, o'erjoy'd, his studied Thanks, and Praise,</L>
<L>To her who made the Miracle he pays:</L>
<L><PB N="346" REF="384"/>
Then Lips to Lips he join'd; now freed from Fear,</L>
<L>He found the Savour of the Kiss sincere:</L>
<L>At this the waken'd Image op'd her Eyes,</L>
<L>And view'd at once the Light, and Lover with Surprize.</L>
<L>The Goddess present at the Match she made,</L>
<L>So bless'd the Bed, such Fruitfulness convey'd,</L>
<L>That e're ten Months had sharpen'd either Horn,</L>
<L>To crown their Bliss, a lovely Boy was born;</L>

<L><HI>Cupid</HI> denies to have inflam'd thy Heart,</L>
<L>Disowns thy Love, and vindicates his Dart:</L>
<L>Some Fury gave thee those infernal Pains,</L>
<L>And shot her venom'd Vipers in thy Veins.</L>
<L>To hate thy Sire, had merited a Curse;</L>
<L>But such an impious Love deserv'd a worse.</L>

<L>Contend in Crowds, ambitious of thy Bed:</L>

<L>Except but him, thou canst not chuse, alone.</L>
<L>She knew it too, the miserable Maid,</L>
<L>E're impious Love her better Thoughts betray'd,</L>

<L>Ye Gods, ye sacred Laws, my Soul defend</L>

<L>Have dash'd a Spice of Envy in the Laws,</L>

<L>Yet some wise Nations break their cruel Chains,</L>
<L>And own no Laws, but those which Love ordains;</L>

<L>O that I had been born in such a Clime,</L>

<L>Pardon the Crime, in Pity to the Cause:</L>
<L>This said, about her Neck the Noose she draws,</L>
<L>The Nurse, who lay without, her faithful Guard,</L>
<L>Though not the Words, the Murmurs over-heard,</L>
<L>And Sighs, and hollow Sounds: Surpriz'd with Fright,</L>
<L>She starts, and leaves her Bed, and springs a Light;</L>
<L>Unlocks the Door, and entring out of Breath,</L>
<L>The Dying saw, and Instruments of Death;</L>
<L>She shrieks, she cuts the Zone with trembling Haste,</L>
<L>And in her Arms her fainting Charge embrac'd:</L>
<L>Next, (for she now had Leisure for her Tears)</L>
<L>She weeping ask'd, in these her blooming Years,</L>
<L>What unforeseen Misfortune caus'd her Care,</L>
<L>To loath her Life, and languish in Despair!</L>
<L>The Maid, with down-cast Eyes, and mute with Grief</L>
<L>For Death unfinish'd, and ill-tim'd Relief,</L>
<L>Stood sullen to her Suit: The Beldame press'd</L>
<L>The more to know, and bar'd her wither'd Breast,</L>
<L>Adjur'd her by the kindly Food she drew</L>
<L>From those dry Founts, her secret Ill to shew.</L>
<L>Sad <HI>Myrrha</HI> sigh'd, and turn'd her Eyes aside;</L>
<L>The Nurse still urg'd, and wou'd not be deny'd:</L>
<L>Nor only promis'd Secresie, but pray'd</L>
<L>She might have Leave to give her offer'd Aid.</L>
<L>Good-will, she said, my want of Strength supplies,</L>
<L>And Diligence shall give what Age denies:</L>
<L>If strong Desires thy Mind to Fury move,</L>
<L>With Charms, and Med'cines I can cure thy Love:</L>
<L>If envious Eyes their hurtful Rays have cast,</L>
<L>More pow'rful Verse shall free thee from the Blast:</L>
<L><PB N="352" REF="390"/>
If Heav'n offended sends thee this Disease,</L>
<L>Offended Heav'n with Pray'rs we can appease.</L>
<L>What then remains, that can these Cares procure?</L>
<L>Thy House is flourishing, thy Fortune sure:</L>
<L>Thy careful Mother yet in Health survives,</L>
<L>And, to thy Comfort, thy kind Father lives.</L>
<L>The Virgin started at her Father's Name,</L>
<L>And sigh'd profoundly, conscious of the Shame:</L>
<L>Nor yet the Nurse her impious Love divin'd,</L>
<L>But yet surmis'd that Love disturb'd her Mind:</L>
<L>Thus thinking, she pursu'd her Point, and laid,</L>
<L>And lull'd within her Lap the mourning Maid;</L>
<L>Then softly sooth'd her thus; I guess your Grief:</L>
<L>You love, my Child; your Love shall find Relief.</L>
<L>My long-experienc'd Age shall be your Guide;</L>
<L>Rely on that, and lay Distrust aside:</L>
<L>No Breath of Air shall on the Secret blow,</L>
<L>Nor shall (what most you fear) your Father know.</L>
<L>Struck once again, as with a Thunder-clap,</L>
<L>The guilty Virgin bounded from her Lap,</L>
<L>And threw her Body prostrate on the Bed,</L>
<L>And, to conceal her Blushes, hid her Head;</L>
<L>There silent lay, and warn'd her with her Hand</L>
<L>To go: But she receiv'd not the Command;</L>
<L>Remaining still importunate to know:</L>
<L>Then <HI>Myrrha</HI> thus; Or ask no more, or go:</L>
<L>I prithee go, or staying spare my Shame;</L>
<L>What thou would'st hear, is impious ev'n to name.</L>
<L>At this, on high the Beldame holds her Hands,</L>
<L>And trembling both with Age, and Terror stands;</L>
<L>Adjures, and falling at her Feet intreats,</L>
<L>Sooths her with Blandishments, and frights with Threats,</L>
<L><PB N="353" REF="391"/>
To tell the Crime intended, or disclose</L>
<L>What Part of it she knew, if she no farther knows.</L>
<L>And last; if conscious to her Counsel made,</L>
<L>Confirms anew the Promise of her Aid.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Myrrha</HI> rais'd her Head; but soon oppress'd</L>
<L>With Shame, reclin'd it on her Nurse's Breast;</L>
<L>Bath'd it with Tears, and strove to have confess'd:</L>
<L>Twice she began, and stopp'd; again she try'd;</L>
<L>The falt'ring Tongue its Office still deny'd.</L>
<L>At last her Veil before her Face she spread,</L>
<L>And drew a long preluding Sigh, and said,</L>
<L>O happy Mother, in thy Marriage-bed!</L>
<L>Then groan'd, and ceas'd. The good old Woman shook,</L>
<L>Stiff were her Eyes, and ghastly was her Look:</L>
<L>Her hoary Hair upright with Horror stood,</L>
<L>Made (to her Grief) more knowing than she wou'd.</L>
<L>Much she reproach'd, and many things she said,</L>
<L>To cure the Madness of th'unhappy Maid,</L>
<L>In vain: For <HI>Myrrha</HI> stood convict of Ill;</L>
<L>Her Reason vanquish'd, but unchang'd her Will:</L>
<L>Perverse of Mind, unable to reply;</L>
<L>She stood resolv'd, or to possess or die.</L>
<L>At length the Fondness of a Nurse prevail'd.</L>
<L>Against her better Sense, and Virtue fail'd:</L>
<L>Enjoy, my Child, since such is thy Desire,</L>
<L>Thy Love, she said; she durst not say, thy Sire:</L>
<L>Live, though unhappy, live on any Terms;</L>
<L>Then with a second Oath her Faith confirms.</L>
<L>The solemn Feast of <HI>Ceres</HI> now was near,</L>
<L>When long white Linnen Stoles the Matrons wear;</L>
<L>Rank'd in Procession walk the pious Train,</L>
<L>Off'ring First-fruits, and Spikes of yellow Grain:</L>
<L><PB N="354" REF="392"/>
For nine long Nights the Nuptial-Bed they shun,</L>
<L>And sanctifying Harvest, lie alone.</L>
<L>Mix'd with the Crowd, the Queen forsook her Lord,</L>
<L>And <HI>Ceres</HI>' Pow'r with secret Rites ador'd:</L>
<L>The Royal Couch, now vacant for a Time,</L>
<L>The crafty Crone, officious in her Crime,</L>
<L>The first Occasion took: The King she found</L>
<L>Easie with Wine, and deep in Pleasures drown'd,</L>
<L>Prepar'd for Love: The Beldame blew the Flame,</L>
<L>Confess'd the Passion, but conceal'd the Name.</L>
<L>Her Form she prais'd; the Monarch ask'd her Years;</L>
<L>And she reply'd, The same thy <HI>Myrrha</HI> bears.</L>
<L>Wine and commended Beauty fir'd his Thought;</L>
<L>Impatient, he commands her to be brought.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with her Charge perform'd, she hies her home,</L>
<L>And gratulates the Nymph, the Task was overcome.</L>
<L><HI>Myrrha</HI> was joy'd the welcome News to hear;</L>
<L>But clogg'd with Guilt, the Joy was unsincere:</L>
<L>So various, so discordant is the Mind,</L>
<L>That in our Will a diff'rent Will we find.</L>
<L>Ill she presag'd, and yet pursu'd her Lust;</L>
<L>For guilty Pleasures give a double Gust.</L>
<L>'Twas Depth of Night: <HI>Arctophylax</HI> had driv'n</L>
<L>His lazy Wain half round the Northern Heav'n,</L>
<L>When <HI>Myrrha</HI> hasten'd to the Crime desir'd:</L>
<L>The Moon beheld her first, and first retir'd:</L>
<L>The Stars amaz'd, ran backward from the Sight,</L>
<L>And (shrunk within their Sockets) lost their Light.</L>
<L><HI>Icarius</HI> first withdraws his holy Flame:</L>
<L>The Virgin Sign, in Heav'n the second Name,</L>
<L>Slides down the Belt, and from her Station flies,</L>
<L>And Night with sable Clouds involves the Skies.</L>
<L><PB N="355" REF="393"/>
Bold <HI>Myrrha</HI> still pursues her black Intent;</L>
<L>She stumbled thrice, (an Omen of th'Event;)</L>
<L>Thrice shriek'd the Fun'ral Owl, yet on she went,</L>
<L>Secure of Shame, because secure of Sight;</L>
<L>Ev'n bashful Sins are impudent by Night.</L>
<L>Link'd Hand in Hand, th'Accomplice, and the Dame,</L>
<L>Their Way exploring, to the Chamber came:</L>
<L>The Door was ope, they blindly grope their Way,</L>
<L>Where dark in Bed th'expecting Monarch lay.</L>
<L>Thus far her Courage held, but here forsakes;</L>
<L>Her faint Knees knock at ev'ry Step she makes.</L>
<L>The nearer to her Crime, the more within</L>
<L>She feels Remorse, and Horror of her Sin;</L>
<L>Repents too late her criminal Desire,</L>
<L>And wishes, that unknown she cou'd retire.</L>
<L>Her, lingring thus, the Nurse (who fear'd Delay</L>
<L>The fatal Secret might at length betray)</L>
<L>Pull'd forward, to compleat the Work begun,</L>
<L>And said to <HI>Cinyras,</HI> Receive thy own.</L>
<L>Thus saying, she deliver'd Kind to Kind,</L>
<L>Accurs'd, and their devoted Bodies join'd.</L>
<L>The Sire, unknowing of the Crime, admits</L>
<L>His Bowels, and profanes the hallow'd Sheets;</L>
<L>He found she trembled, but believ'd she strove</L>
<L>With Maiden Modesty, against her Love,</L>
<L>And sought with flatt'ring Words vain Fancies to remove.</L>
<L>Perhaps he said, My Daughter, cease thy Fears,</L>
<L>(Because the Title suited with her Years;)</L>
<L>And Father, she might whisper him again,</L>
<L>That Names might not be wanting to the Sin.</L>
<L>Full of her Sire, she left th' incestuous Bed,</L>
<L>And carry'd in her Womb the Crime she bred.</L>
<L><PB N="356" REF="394"/>
Another, and another Night she came;</L>
<L>For frequent Sin had left no Sense of Shame:</L>
<L>Till <HI>Cinyras</HI> desir'd to see her Face,</L>
<L>Whose Body he had held in close Embrace,</L>
<L>And brought a Taper; the Revealer, Light,</L>
<L>Expos'd both Crime, and Criminal to Sight.</L>
<L>Grief, Rage, Amazement, cou'd no Speech afford,</L>
<L>But from the Sheath he drew th' avenging Sword:</L>
<L>The Guilty fled: The Benefit of Night,</L>
<L>That favour'd first the Sin, secur'd the Flight.</L>
<L>Long wandring thro' the spacious Fields, she bent</L>
<L>Her Voyage to th'<HI>Arabian</HI> Continent;</L>
<L>Then pass'd the Region which <HI>Panchaea</HI> join'd,</L>
<L>And flying, left the palmy Plains behind.</L>
<L>Nine times the Moon had mew'd her Horns; at length</L>
<L>With Travel weary, unsupply'd with Strength,</L>
<L>And with the Burden of her Womb oppress'd,</L>
<L><HI>Sabaean</HI> Fields afford her needful Rest:</L>
<L>There, loathing Life, and yet of Death afraid,</L>
<L>In Anguish of her Spirit, thus she pray'd.</L>
<L>Ye Pow'rs, if any so propitious are</L>
<L>T'accept my Penitence, and hear my Pray'r;</L>
<L>Your Judgments, I confess, are justly sent;</L>
<L>Great Sins deserve as great a Punishment:</L>
<L>Yet since my Life the Living will profane,</L>
<L>And since my Death the happy Dead will stain,</L>
<L>A middle State your Mercy may bestow,</L>
<L>Betwixt the Realms above, and those below:</L>
<L>Some other Form to wretched <HI>Myrrha</HI> give,</L>
<L>Nor let her wholly die, nor wholly live.</L>
<L>The Pray'rs of Penitents are never vain;</L>
<L>At least, she did her last Request obtain:</L>
<L><PB N="357" REF="395"/>
For while she spoke, the Ground began to rise,</L>
<L>And gather'd round her Feet, her Legs, and Thighs;</L>
<L>Her Toes in Roots descend, and spreading wide,</L>
<L>A firm Foundation for the Trunk provide:</L>
<L>Her solid Bones convert to solid Wood,</L>
<L>To Pith her Marrow, and to Sap her Blood:</L>
<L>Her Arms are Boughs, her Fingers change their Kind,</L>
<L>Her tender Skin is harden'd into Rind.</L>
<L>And now the rising Tree her Womb invests,</L>
<L>Now, shooting upwards still, invades her Breasts,</L>
<L>And shades the Neck; when, weary with Delay,</L>
<L>She sunk her Head within, and met it half the way.</L>
<L>And though with outward Shape she lost her Sense,</L>
<L>With bitter Tears she wept her last Offence;</L>
<L>And still she weeps; nor sheds her Tears in vain;</L>
<L>For still the precious Drops her Name retain.</L>
<L>Mean time the mis-begotten Infant grows,</L>
<L>And, ripe for Birth, distends with deadly Throws</L>
<L>The swelling Rind, with unavailing Strife,</L>
<L>To leave the wooden Womb, and pushes into Life.</L>
<L>The Mother-Tree, as if oppress'd with Pain,</L>
<L>Writhes here, and there, to break the Bark, in vain;</L>
<L>And, like a lab'ring Woman, wou'd have pray'd,</L>
<L>But wants a Voice to call <HI>Lucina</HI>'s Aid:</L>
<L>The bending Bole sends out a hollow Sound,</L>
<L>And trickling Tears fall thicker on the Ground.</L>
<L>The mild <HI>Lucina</HI> came uncall'd, and stood</L>
<L>Beside the strugling Boughs, and heard the groaning Wood:</L>
<L>Then reach'd her Midwife-Hand to speed the Throws,</L>
<L>And spoke the pow'rful Spells that Babes to Birth disclose.</L>
<L>The Bark divides, the living Load to free,</L>
<L>And safe delivers the Convulsive Tree.</L>
<L><PB N="358" REF="396"/>
The ready Nymphs receive the crying Child,</L>
<L>And wash him in the Tears the Parent-Plant distill'd.</L>
<L>They swath'd him with their Scarfs; beneath him spread</L>
<L>The Ground with Herbs; with Roses rais'd his Head.</L>
<L>The lovely Babe was born with ev'ry Grace,</L>
<L>Ev'n Envy must have prais'd so fair a Face:</L>
<L>Such was his Form, as Painters when they show</L>
<L>Their utmost Art, on naked Loves bestow:</L>
<L>And that their Arms no Diff'rence might betray,</L>
<L>Give him a Bow, or his from <HI>Cupid</HI> take away.</L>
<L>Time glides along with undiscover'd Haste,</L>

<L>So swift are Years. The Babe whom just before</L>
<L>His Grandsire got, and whom his Sister bore;</L>
<L>The Drop, the Thing, which late the Tree inclos'd,</L>
<L>And late the yawning Bark to Life expos'd;</L>
<L>A Babe, a Boy, a beauteous Youth appears,</L>
<L>And lovelier than himself at riper Years.</L>

<L>For <HI>Cytherëa</HI>'s Lips while <HI>Cupid</HI> prest,</L>

<L>The Goddess felt it, and with Fury stung,</L>
<L>The wanton Mischief from her Bosom flung:</L>
<L>Yet thought at first the Danger slight, but found</L>
<L>The Dart too faithful, and too deep the Wound.</L>
<L>Fir'd with a mortal Beauty, she disdains</L>

<L>On rosie Beds beneath the Myrtle Shade,</L>
<L>Whose pleasing Care was to improve each Grace,</L>
<L>And add more Charms to an unrival'd Face,</L>
<L>Now buskin'd, like the Virgin Huntress, goes</L>

<L>Seal'd the soft Accents with a softer Kiss.</L>
<L>Perhaps thou may'st have heard a Virgin's Name,</L>
<L>Who still in Swiftness swiftest Youths o'ercame.</L>
<L>Wond'rous! that female Weakness should out-do</L>
<L>A manly Strength; the Wonder yet is true.</L>
<L>'Twas doubtful, if her Triumphs in the Field</L>
<L>Did to her Form's triumphant Glories yield;</L>
<L>Whether her Face could with more Ease decoy</L>
<L>A Crowd of Lovers, or her Feet destroy.</L>
<L>For once <HI>Apollo</HI> she implor'd to show</L>

<L>A Rival now to all the Youths, who run,</L>
<L>Envious he fears, they should not be undone.</L>

<L>See! what a Virgin's Bloom adorns the Boy!</L>
<L>Why wilt thou run? and why thy self destroy?</L>
<L><HI>Hippomenes!</HI> O that I ne'er had been</L>
<L>By those bright Eyes unfortunately seen!</L>
<L>Ah! tempt not thus a swift, untimely Fate;</L>
<L>Thy Life is worthy of the longest Date.</L>
<L>Were I less wretched, did the galling Chain</L>
<L>Of rigid Gods not my free Choice restrain,</L>
<L>By thee alone I could with Joy be led</L>
<L>To taste the Raptures of a Nuptial Bed.</L>
<L>Thus she disclos'd the Woman's secret Heart,</L>
<L>Young, innocent, and new to <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Dart.</L>
<L>Her Thoughts, her Words, her Actions wildly rove,</L>
<L>With Love she burns, yet knows not that 'tis Love.</L>
<L>Her Royal Sire now with the murm'ring Crowd</L>
<L>Demands the Race impatiently aloud.</L>
<L><HI>Hippomenes</HI> then with true Fervour pray'd,</L>
<L>My bold Attempt let <HI>Venus</HI> kindly aid.</L>
<L>By her sweet Pow'r I felt this am'rous Fire,</L>
<L>Still may she succour, whom she did inspire.</L>
<L>A soft, unenvious Wind, with speedy Care,</L>
<L>Wafted to Heav'n the Lover's tender Pray'r.</L>
<L>Pity, I own, soon gain'd the wish'd Consent,</L>
<L>And all th' Assistance he implor'd I lent.</L>
<L>The <HI>Cyprian</HI> Lands, tho' rich, in Richness yield</L>
<L>To that, surnam'd the <HI>Tamasenian</HI> Field.</L>
<L>That Field of old was added to my Shrine,</L>
<L>And its choice Products consecrated mine.</L>
<L>A Tree there stands, full glorious to behold,</L>
<L>Gold are the Leafs, the crackling Branches Gold.</L>
<L><PB N="365" REF="403"/>
It chanc'd, three Apples in my Hands I bore,</L>
<L>Which newly from the Tree I sportive tore;</L>
<L>Seen by the Youth alone, to him I brought</L>
<L>The Fruit, and when, and how to use it, taught.</L>
<L>The Signal sounding by the King's Command,</L>
<L>Both start at once, and sweep th'unprinted Sand.</L>
<L>So swiftly move their Feet, they might with Ease,</L>
<L>Scarce moisten'd, skim along the glassie Seas;</L>
<L>Or with a wond'rous Levity be born</L>
<L>O'er yellow Harvests of unbending Corn.</L>
<L>Now fav'ring Peals resound from ev'ry Part,</L>
<L>Spirit the Youth, and fire his fainting Heart.</L>
<L><HI>Hippomenes!</HI> (they cry'd) thy Life preserve,</L>
<L>Intensely labour, and stretch ev'ry Nerve.</L>
<L>Base Fear alone can baffle thy Design,</L>
<L>Shoot boldly onward, and the Goal is thine.</L>
<L>'Tis doubtful whether Shouts, like these, convey'd</L>
<L>More Pleasures to the Youth, or to the Maid.</L>
<L>When a long Distance oft she could have gain'd,</L>
<L>She check'd her Swiftness, and her Feet restrain'd:</L>
<L>She sigh'd, and dwelt, and languish'd on his Face,</L>
<L>Then with unwilling Speed pursu'd the Race.</L>
<L>O'er-spent with Heat, his Breath he faintly drew,</L>
<L>Parch'd was his Mouth, nor yet the Goal in view,</L>
<L>And the first Apple on the Plain he threw.</L>
<L>The Nymph stop'd sudden at th'unusual Sight,</L>
<L>Struck with the Fruit so beautifully bright.</L>
<L>Aside she starts, the Wonder to behold,</L>
<L>And eager stoops to catch the rouling Gold.</L>
<L>Th'observant Youth past by, and scour'd along,</L>
<L>While Peals of Joy rung from th' applauding Throng.</L>
<L><PB N="366" REF="404"/>
Unkindly she corrects the short Delay,</L>
<L>And to redeem the Time fleets swift away,</L>
<L>Swift, as the Light'ning, or the Northern Wind,</L>
<L>And far she leaves the panting Youth behind.</L>
<L>Again he strives the flying Nymph to hold</L>
<L>With the Temptation of the second Gold:</L>
<L>The bright Temptation fruitlesly was tost,</L>
<L>So soon, alas! she won the Distance lost.</L>
<L>Now but a little Interval of Space</L>
<L>Remain'd for the Decision of the Race.</L>
<L>Fair Author of the precious Gift, he said,</L>
<L>Be thou, O Goddess, Author of my Aid!</L>
<L>Then of the shining Fruit the last he drew,</L>
<L>And with his full-collected Vigour threw:</L>
<L>The Virgin still the longer to detain,</L>
<L>Threw not directly, but a-cross the Plain.</L>
<L>She seem'd a-while perplex'd in dubious Thought,</L>
<L>If the far-distant Apple should be sought:</L>
<L>I lur'd her backward Mind to seize the Bait,</L>
<L>And to the massie Gold gave double Weight.</L>
<L>My Favour to my Votary was show'd,</L>
<L>Her Speed I lessen'd, and encreas'd her Load.</L>
<L>But least, tho' long, the rapid Race be run,</L>
<L>Before my longer, tedious Tale is done,</L>
<L>The Youth the Goal, and so the Virgin won.</L>
<L>Might I, <HI>Adonis,</HI> now not hope to see</L>
<L>His grateful Thanks pour'd out for Victory?</L>
<L>His pious Incense on my Altars laid?</L>
<L>But he nor grateful Thanks, nor Incense paid.</L>
<L>Enrag'd I vow'd, that with the Youth the Fair,</L>
<L>For his Contempt, should my keen Vengeance share;</L>
<L><PB N="367" REF="405"/>
That future Lovers might my Pow'r revere,</L>
<L>And from their sad Examples learn to fear.</L>
<L>The silent Fanes, the sanctify'd Abodes</L>
<L>Of <HI>Cybelé,</HI> great Mother of the Gods,</L>
<L>Rais'd by <HI>Echion</HI> in a lonely Wood,</L>
<L>And full of brown, religious Horror stood.</L>
<L>By a long painful Journey faint, they chose</L>
<L>Their weary Limbs here secret to repose.</L>
<L>But soon my Pow'r inflam'd the lustful Boy,</L>
<L>Careless of Rest he sought untimely Joy.</L>
<L>A hallow'd, gloomy Cave, with Moss o'er-grown,</L>
<L>The Temple joyn'd, of native Pumice-stone,</L>
<L>Where antique Images by Priests were kept,</L>
<L>And wooden Deities securely slept.</L>
<L>Thither the rash <HI>Hippomenes</HI> retires,</L>
<L>And gives a Loose to all his wild Desires,</L>
<L>And the chaste Cell pollutes with wanton Fires.</L>
<L>The sacred Statues trembled with Surprize,</L>
<L>The tow'ry Goddess, blushing, veil'd her Eyes;</L>
<L>And the lewd Pair to <HI>Stygian</HI> Sounds had sent,</L>
<L>But unrevengeful seem'd that Punishment.</L>
<L>A heavier Doom such black Prophaneness draws,</L>
<L>Their taper Fingers turn to crooked Paws.</L>
<L>No more their Necks the Smoothness can retain,</L>
<L>Now cover'd sudden with a yellow Mane.</L>
<L>Arms change to Legs: Each finds the hard'ning Breast</L>
<L>Of Rage unknown, and wond'rous Strength possest.</L>
<L>Their alter'd Looks with Fury grim appear,</L>
<L>And on the Ground their brushing Tails they hear.</L>
<L>They haunt the Woods: Their Voices, which before</L>
<L>Were musically sweet, now hoarsly roar.</L>

Hence Lions, dreadful to the lab'ring Swains,</L>
<L>Are tam'd by <HI>Cybelé,</HI> and curb'd with Reins,</L>

<L>The Savage, which not shuns thee, timely shun,</L>

<L>The callow Hero show'd a manly Heart,</L>
<L>And pierc'd the Savage with a side-long Dart.</L>
<L>The flying Savage, wounded, turn'd again,</L>

<L>Down with swift Flight she plung'd, nor Rage forbore,</L>
<L>At once her Garments, and her Hair she tore.</L>
<L><PB N="369" REF="407"/>
With cruel Blows she beat her guiltless Breast,</L>
<L>The Fates upbraided, and her Love confest.</L>

<L>Short time ensu'd, till where the Blood was shed,</L>
<L>A Flow'r began to rear its purple Head:</L>

<L>These Reasons mov'd her starlike Husband's Heart,</L>
<L>But still he held his Purpose to depart:</L>
<L>For as he lov'd her equal to his Life,</L>
<L>He would not to the Seas expose his Wife;</L>
<L>Nor could be wrought his Voyage to refrain,</L>
<L>But sought by Arguments to sooth her Pain:</L>
<L>Nor these avail'd; at length he lights on one,</L>
<L>With which so difficult a Cause he won:</L>
<L>My Love, so short an Absence cease to fear,</L>
<L>For by my Father's holy Flame, I swear,</L>
<L>Before two Moons their Orb with Light adorn.</L>
<L>If Heav'n allow me Life, I will return.</L>
<L><PB N="392" REF="430"/>
This Promise of so short a Stay prevails;</L>
<L>He soon equips the Ship, supplies the Sails,</L>
<L>And gives the Word to launch; she trembling views</L>
<L>This Pomp of Death, and parting Tears renews:</L>
<L>Last with a Kiss, she took a long Farewel,</L>
<L>Sigh'd with a sad Presage, and swooning fell:</L>
<L>While <HI>Ceyx</HI> seeks Delays, the lusty Crew,</L>
<L>Rais'd on their Banks, their Oars in order drew</L>
<L>To their broad Breasts, the Ship with Fury flew.</L>
<L>The Queen recover'd rears her humid Eyes,</L>
<L>And first her Husband on the Poop espies,</L>
<L>Shaking his Hand at Distance on the Main;</L>
<L>She took the Sign, and shook her Hand again.</L>
<L>Still as the Ground recedes, contracts her View</L>
<L>With sharpen'd Sight, till she no longer knew</L>
<L>The much-lov'd Face; that Comfort lost supplies</L>
<L>With less, and with the Galley feeds her Eyes;</L>
<L>The Galley born from View by rising Gales,</L>
<L>She follow'd with her Sight the flying Sails:</L>
<L>When ev'n the flying Sails were seen no more,</L>
<L>Forsaken of all Sight, she left the Shoar.</L>
<L>Then on her Bridal-Bed her Body throws,</L>
<L>And sought in Sleep her weary'd Eyes to close:</L>
<L>Her Husband's Pillow, and the widow'd part</L>
<L>Which once he press'd, renew'd the former Smart.</L>
<L>And now a Breeze from Shoar began to blow,</L>
<L>The Sailors ship their Oars, and cease to row;</L>
<L>Then hoist their Yards a-trip, and all their Sails</L>
<L>Let fall, to court the Wind, and catch the Gales:</L>
<L>By this the Vessel half her Course had run,</L>
<L>And as much rested till the rising Sun;</L>
<L><PB N="393" REF="431"/>
Both Shoars were lost to Sight, when at the Close</L>
<L>Of Day a stiffer Gale at East arose:</L>
<L>The Sea grew white, the rowling Waves from far,</L>
<L>Like Heralds, first denounce the wat'ry War.</L>
<L>This seen, the Master soon began to cry,</L>
<L>Strike, strike the Top-sail; let the Main-sheet fly,</L>
<L>And furl your Sails: The Winds repel the Sound,</L>
<L>And in the Speaker's Mouth the Speech is drown'd.</L>
<L>Yet of their own Accord, as Danger taught</L>
<L>Each in his Way, officiously they wrought;</L>
<L>Some stow their Oars, or stop the leaky Sides,</L>
<L>Another bolder yet the Yard bestrides,</L>
<L>And folds the Sails; a fourth with Labour laves</L>
<L>Th' intruding Seas, and Waves ejects on Waves.</L>
<L>In this Confusion while their Work they ply,</L>
<L>The Winds augment the Winter of the Sky,</L>
<L>And wage intestine Wars; the suff'ring Seas</L>
<L>Are toss'd, and mingled as their Tyrants please.</L>
<L>The Master would command, but in despair</L>
<L>Of Safety, stands amaz'd with stupid Care,</L>
<L>Nor what to bid, or what forbid he knows,</L>
<L>Th' ungovern'd Tempest to such Fury grows:</L>
<L>Vain is his Force, and vainer is his Skill;</L>
<L>With such a Concourse comes the Flood of Ill:</L>
<L>The Cries of Men are mix'd with rattling Shrowds;</L>
<L>Seas dash on Seas, and Clouds encounter Clouds:</L>
<L>At once from East to West, from Pole to Pole,</L>
<L>The forky Lightnings flash, the roaring Thunders roul.</L>
<L>Now Waves on Waves ascending scale the Skies,</L>
<L>And in the Fires above the Water fries:</L>
<L>When yellow Sands are sifted from below,</L>
<L>The glitt'ring Billows give a golden Show:</L>
<L><PB N="394" REF="432"/>
And when the fouler Bottom spews the Black,</L>
<L>The <HI>Stygian</HI> Dye the tainted Waters take:</L>
<L>Then frothy White appear the flatted Seas,</L>
<L>And change their Colour, changing their Disease.</L>
<L>Like various Fits the <HI>Trachin</HI> Vessel finds,</L>
<L>And now sublime, she rides upon the Winds;</L>
<L>As from a lofty Summit looks from high,</L>
<L>And from the Clouds beholds the neather Sky;</L>
<L>Now from the Depth of Hell they lift their Sight,</L>
<L>And at a Distance see superior Light:</L>
<L>The lashing Billows make a loud Report,</L>
<L>And beat her Sides, as batt'ring Rams a Fort:</L>
<L>Or as a Lyon bounding in his way,</L>
<L>With Force augmented, bears against his Prey,</L>
<L>Sidelong to seize; or unapal'd with Fear,</L>
<L>Springs on the Toils, and rushes on the Spear:</L>
<L>So Seas impell'd by Winds, with added Pow'r</L>
<L>Assault the Sides, and o'er the Hatches tow'r.</L>
<L>The Planks (their pitchy Cov'ring wash'd away)</L>
<L>Now yield; and now a yawning Breach display:</L>
<L>The roaring Waters with a hostile Tide</L>
<L>Rush through the Ruins of her gaping Side.</L>
<L>Mean time in Sheets of Rain the Sky descends,</L>
<L>And Ocean swell'd with Waters upwards tends;</L>
<L>One rising, falling one, the Heav'ns and Sea</L>
<L>Meet at their Confines, in the middle Way:</L>
<L>The Sails are drunk with Show'rs, and drop with Rain,</L>
<L>Sweet Waters mingle with the briny Main.</L>
<L>No Star appears to lend his friendly Light;</L>
<L>Darkness and Tempest make a double Night;</L>
<L>But flashing Fires disclose the Deep by turns,</L>
<L>And while the Light'nings blaze, the Water burns.</L>
<L><PB N="395" REF="433"/>
Now all the Waves their scatter'd Force unite,</L>
<L>And, as a Soldier, foremost in the Fight,</L>
<L>Makes way for others, and an Host alone</L>
<L>Still presses on, and urging gains the Town;</L>
<L>So while th' invading Billows come a-breast,</L>
<L>The Hero Tenth advanc'd before the rest,</L>
<L>Sweeps all before him with impetuous Sway,</L>
<L>And from the Walls descends upon the Prey;</L>
<L>Part following enter, Part remain without,</L>
<L>With Envy hear their Fellows conqu'ring Shout,</L>
<L>And mount on others Backs, in hope to share</L>
<L>The City, thus become the Seat of War.</L>
<L>An universal Cry resounds aloud,</L>
<L>The Sailors run in Heaps, a helpless Crowd;</L>
<L>Art fails, and Courage falls, no Succour near;</L>
<L>As many Waves, as many Deaths appear.</L>
<L>One weeps, and yet despairs of late Relief;</L>
<L>One cannot weep, his Fears congeal his Grief,</L>
<L>But stupid, with dry Eyes expects his Fate:</L>
<L>One with loud Shrieks laments his lost Estate,</L>
<L>And calls those happy whom their Fun'rals wait.</L>
<L>This Wretch with Pray'rs and Vows the Gods implores,</L>
<L>And ev'n the Skies he cannot see, adores.</L>
<L>That other on his Friends his Thoughts bestows,</L>
<L>His careful Father, and his faithful Spouse.</L>
<L>The covetous Wordling in his anxious Mind,</L>
<L>Thinks only on the Wealth he left behind.</L>
<L>All <HI>Ceyx</HI> his <HI>Alcyone</HI> employs,</L>
<L>For her he grieves, yet in her Absence joys:</L>
<L>His Wife he wishes, and would still be near,</L>
<L>Not her with him, but wishes him with her:</L>
<L>Now with last Looks he seeks his native Shoar,</L>
<L>Which Fate has destin'd him to see no more;</L>
<L><PB N="396" REF="434"/>
He sought, but in the dark tempestuous Night</L>
<L>He knew not whither to direct his Sight.</L>
<L>So whirl the Seas, such Darkness blinds the Sky,</L>
<L>That the black Night receives a deeper Dye.</L>
<L>The giddy Ship ran round; the Tempest tore</L>
<L>Her Mast, and over-board the Rudder bore.</L>
<L>One Billow mounts; and with a scornful Brow,</L>
<L>Proud of her Conquest gain'd, insults the Waves below;</L>
<L>Nor lighter falls, than if some Giant tore</L>
<L><HI>Pindus</HI> and <HI>Athos,</HI> with the Freight they bore,</L>
<L>And toss'd on Seas; press'd with the pond'rous Blow,</L>
<L>Down sinks the Ship within th' Abyss below:</L>
<L>Down with the Vessel sink into the Main,</L>
<L>The many, never more to rise again.</L>
<L>Some few on scatter'd Planks, with fruitless Care,</L>
<L>Lay hold and swim, but while they swim, despair.</L>
<L>Ev'n he who late a Scepter did command,</L>
<L>Now grasps a floating Fragment in his Hand;</L>
<L>And while he struggles on the stormy Main,</L>
<L>Invokes his Father, and his Wife's, in vain.</L>
<L>But yet his Consort is his greatest Care;</L>
<L><HI>Alcyone</HI> he names amidst his Pray'r;</L>
<L>Names as a Charm against the Waves and Wind;</L>
<L>Most in his Mouth, and ever in his Mind.</L>
<L>Tir'd with his Toil, all Hopes of Safety past,</L>
<L>From Pray'rs to Wishes he descends at last;</L>
<L>That his dead Body, wafted to the Sands,</L>
<L>Might have its Burial from her friendly Hands.</L>
<L>As oft as he can catch a Gulp of Air,</L>
<L>And peep above the Seas, he names the Fair;</L>
<L>And ev'n when plung'd beneath, on her he raves,</L>
<L>Murm'ring <HI>Alcyone</HI> below the Waves:</L>
<L><PB N="397" REF="435"/>
At last a falling Billow stops his Breath,</L>
<L>Breaks o'er his Head, and whelms him underneath.</L>
<L>Bright <HI>Lucifer</HI> unlike himself appears</L>
<L>That Night, his heav'nly Form obscur'd with Tears,</L>
<L>And since he was forbid to leave the Skies,</L>
<L>He muffled with a Cloud his mournful Eyes.</L>
<L>Mean time <HI>Alcyonè</HI> (his Fate unknown)</L>
<L>Computes how many Nights he had been gone,</L>
<L>Observes the waning Moon with hourly View,</L>
<L>Numbers her Age, and wishes for a new;</L>

<L>New-dress'd to meet her Lord returning home,</L>
<L>Flatt'ring her Heart with Joys that never were to come:</L>
<L>She fum'd the Temples with an od'rous Flame,</L>
<L>And oft before the sacred Altars came,</L>
<L>To pray for him, who was an empty Name.</L>
<L>All Pow'rs implor'd, but far above the rest</L>
<L>To <HI>Juno</HI> she her pious Vows address'd,</L>

<L>And no pretending Rival share a Part;</L>
<L>This last Petition heard of all her Pray'r,</L>
<L>The rest, dispers'd by Winds, were lost in Air.</L>
<L>But she, the Goddess of the Nuptial Bed,</L>
<L>Tir'd with her vain Devotions for the Dead,</L>
<L>Resolv'd the tainted Hand should be repell'd,</L>
<L>Which Incense offer'd, and her Altar held:</L>

<HEAD>The House of SLEEP.</HEAD>
<L>Near the <HI>Cymmerians,</HI> in his dark Abode,</L>
<L>Deep in a Cavern, dwells the drowzy God;</L>
<L>Whose gloomy Mansion nor the rising Sun,</L>
<L>Nor setting, visits, nor the lightsome Noon;</L>
<L>But lazy Vapours round the Region fly,</L>
<L>Perpetual Twilight, and a doubtful Sky:</L>
<L>No crowing Cock does there his Wings display,</L>
<L>Nor with his horny Bill provoke the Day;</L>
<L>Nor watchful Dogs, nor the more wakeful Geese,</L>
<L>Disturb with nightly Noise the sacred Peace;</L>
<L>Nor Beast of Nature, nor the Tame are nigh,</L>
<L>Nor Trees with Tempests rock'd, nor human Cry;</L>
<L>But safe Repose without an Air of Breath</L>
<L>Dwells here, and a dumb Quiet next to Death.</L>
<L>An Arm of <HI>Lethè,</HI> with a gentle Flow</L>
<L>Arising upwards from the Rock below,</L>
<L>The Palace moats, and o'er the Pebbles creeps,</L>

<L>Around its Entry nodding Poppies grow,</L>
<L>And all cool Simples that sweet Rest bestow;</L>
<L><PB N="399" REF="437"/>
Night from the Plants their sleepy Virtue drains,</L>
<L>And passing, sheds it on the silent Plains:</L>
<L>No Door there was th' unguarded House to keep,</L>
<L>On creaking Hinges turn'd, to break his Sleep.</L>
<L>But in the gloomy Court was rais'd a Bed,</L>
<L>Stuff'd with black Plumes, and on an Ebon-sted:</L>
<L>Black was the Cov'ring too, where lay the God,</L>
<L>And slept supine, his Limbs display'd abroad:</L>
<L>About his Head fantastick Visions fly,</L>
<L>Which various Images of things supply,</L>
<L>And mock their Forms; the Leaves on Trees not more,</L>
<L>Nor bearded Ears in Fields, nor Sands upon the Shore.</L>

But fled, returning by the way she went,</L>
<L>And swerv'd along her Bow with swift Ascent.</L>
<L>The God, uneasy till he slept again,</L>
<L>Resolv'd at once to rid himself of Pain;</L>
<L>And, tho' against his Custom, call'd aloud,</L>
<L>Exciting <HI>Morpheus</HI> from the sleepy Crowd:</L>
<L><HI>Morpheus,</HI> of all his numerous Train, express'd</L>
<L>The Shape of Man, and imitated best;</L>
<L>The Walk, the Words, the Gesture could supply,</L>

<L>Another Birds, and Beasts, and Dragons apes,</L>

<L>This Demon, <HI>Icelos,</HI> in Heav'ns high Hall</L>
<L>The Gods have nam'd; but Men <HI>Phobetor</HI> call.</L>
<L>A third is <HI>Phantasus,</HI> whose Actions roul</L>

And pale as Death, despoil'd of his Array,</L>

<L>Know'st thou not me? Not yet, unhappy Wife?</L>
<L>Or are my Features perish'd with my Life?</L>
<L>Look once again, and for thy Husband lost,</L>

<L>Thy Vows for my Return were all in vain;</L>
<L>The stormy South o'ertook us in the Main,</L>

<L>Rise, wretched Widow, rise; nor undeplor'd</L>
<L>Permit my Soul to pass the <HI>Stygian</HI> Ford;</L>

<L>Thus said the Player-God; and adding Art</L>
<L>Of Voice and Gesture, so perform'd his Part,</L>
<L>She thought (so like her Love the Shade appears)</L>
<L>That <HI>Ceyx</HI> spake the Words, and <HI>Ceyx</HI> shed the Tears:</L>
<L>She groan'd, her inward Soul with Grief opprest,</L>
<L>She sigh'd, she wept, and sleeping beat her Breast;</L>
<L>Then stretch'd her Arms t' embrace his Body bare;</L>
<L>Her clasping Arms inclose but empty Air:</L>
<L>At this, not yet awake, she cry'd, O stay;</L>
<L>One is our Fate, and common is our Way!</L>
<L>So dreadful was the Dream, so loud she spoke,</L>
<L>That starting sudden up, the Slumber broke:</L>
<L><PB N="402" REF="440"/>
Then cast her Eyes around, in hope to view</L>
<L>Her vanish'd Lord, and find the Vision true:</L>
<L>For now the Maids, who waited her Commands,</L>
<L>Ran in with lighted Tapers in their Hands.</L>
<L>Tir'd with the Search, not finding what she seeks,</L>
<L>With cruel Blows she pounds her blubber'd Cheeks;</L>
<L>Then from her beaten Breast the Linnen tare,</L>
<L>And cut the golden Caul that bound her Hair.</L>
<L>Her Nurse demands the Cause; with louder Cries,</L>

<L>No more <HI>Alcyonè</HI> she suffer'd Death</L>

<L>I saw, I saw him manifest in View,</L>
<L>His Voice, his Figure, and his Gestures knew:</L>
<L>His Lustre lost, and ev'ry living Grace,</L>
<L>Yet I retain'd the Features of his Face;</L>
<L>Tho' with pale Cheeks, wet Beard, and dropping Hair,</L>
<L>None but my <HI>Ceyx</HI> could appear so fair:</L>
<L>I would have strain'd him with a strict Embrace,</L>

<L>There, ev'n just there he stood; and as she spoke,</L>
<L>Where last the Spectre was she cast her Look:</L>
<L>Fain wou'd she hope, and gaz'd upon the Ground,</L>
<L>If any printed Footsteps might be found.</L>
<L>Then sigh'd and said; This I too well foreknew,</L>
<L>And my prophetick Fears presag'd too true:</L>
<L>'Twas what I begg'd, when with a bleeding Heart</L>
<L>I took my Leave, and suffer'd thee to part;</L>

So had my <HI>Ceyx</HI> still been living here,</L>

<L>The Storms were not so cruel; should I strive</L>
<L>To lengthen Life, and such a Grief survive;</L>
<L>But neither will I strive, nor wretched Thee</L>
<L>In Death forsake, but keep thee Company.</L>
<L>If not one common Sepulcher contains</L>
<L>Our Bodies, or one Urn our last Remains,</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Ceyx</HI> and <HI>Alcyonè</HI> shall join,</L>

<L>No farther Voice her mighty Grief affords,</L>

<L>Soft Tears, and Groans, and dumb Complaints supply'd.</L>
<L>'Twas Morning; to the Port she takes her way,</L>

<L>Where last he stood: And while she sadly said,</L>
<L>'Twas here he left me, lingring here delay'd</L>
<L>His parting Kiss, and there his Anchors weigh'd.</L>
<L>Thus speaking, while her Thoughts past Actions trace,</L>
<L>And call to mind, admonish'd by the Place,</L>
<L>Sharp at her utmost Ken she cast her Eyes,</L>
<L>And somewhat floating from afar descries:</L>

<HEAD>The Story of CYGNUS.</HEAD>
<L>From these first Onsets, the <HI>Sigaean</HI> Shore</L>
<L>Was strew'd with Carcasses, and stain'd with Gore:</L>
<L><HI>Neptunian Cygnus</HI> Troops of <HI>Greeks</HI> had slain;</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> in his Carr had scour'd the Plain,</L>
<L>And clear'd the <HI>Trojan</HI> Ranks: Where-e'er he fought,</L>
<L><HI>Cygnus,</HI> or <HI>Hector,</HI> through the Fields he sought:</L>
<L><HI>Cygnus</HI> he found; on him his Force essay'd:</L>
<L>For <HI>Hector</HI> was to the tenth Year delay'd.</L>
<L><PB N="411" REF="450"/>
His white man'd Steeds, that bow'd beneath the Yoke,</L>
<L>He chear'd to Courage, with a gentle Stroke;</L>
<L>Then urg'd his fiery Chariot on the Foe;</L>
<L>And rising shook his Lance; in act to throw.</L>
<L>But first he cry'd, O Youth, be proud to bear</L>
<L>Thy Death, ennobled by <HI>Pelides</HI>' Spear.</L>
<L>The Lance pursu'd the Voice without delay,</L>
<L>Nor did the whizzing Weapon miss the way;</L>
<L>But pierc'd his Cuirass, with such Fury sent,</L>
<L>And sign'd his Bosom with a Purple Dint.</L>
<L>At this the Seed of <HI>Neptune</HI>; Goddess-born,</L>
<L>For Ornament, not Use, these Arms are worn;</L>
<L>This Helm, and heavy Buckler, I can spare;</L>
<L>As only Decorations of the War:</L>
<L>So <HI>Mars</HI> is arm'd for Glory, not for Need.</L>
<L>'Tis somewhat more from <HI>Neptune</HI> to proceed,</L>
<L>Than from a Daughter of the Sea to spring:</L>
<L>Thy Sire is Mortal; mine is Ocean's King.</L>
<L>Secure of Death, I shou'd contemn thy Dart,</L>
<L>Tho' naked; and impassible depart:</L>
<L>He said, and threw: The trembling Weapon pass'd</L>
<L>Through nine Bull-hides, each under other plac'd,</L>
<L>On his broad Shield; and stuck within the last.</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> wrench'd it out; and sent again</L>
<L>The hostile Gift: The hostile Gift was vain.</L>
<L>He try'd a third, a tough well-chosen Spear;</L>
<L>Th' inviolable Body stood sincere,</L>
<L>Though <HI>Cygnus</HI> then did no Defence provide,</L>
<L>But scornful offer'd his unshielded Side.</L>
<L>Not otherwise th'impatient Hero far'd,</L>
<L>Than as a Bull, incompass'd with a Guard,</L>
<L>Amid the <HI>Circus</HI> roars, provok'd from far</L>
<L>By sight of Scarlet, and a sanguine War:</L>
<L><PB N="412" REF="451"/>
They quit their Ground, his bended Horns elude;</L>
<L>In vain pursuing, and in vain pursu'd.</L>
<L>Before to farther Fight he wou'd advance,</L>
<L>He stood considering, and survey'd his Lance.</L>
<L>Doubts if he wielded not a wooden Spear</L>
<L>Without a Point: He look'd, the Point was there.</L>
<L>This is my Hand, and this my Lance, he said;</L>
<L>By which so many thousand Foes are dead.</L>
<L>O whither is their usual Virtue fled!</L>
<L>I had it once; and the <HI>Lyrnessian</HI> Wall,</L>
<L>And <HI>Tenedos,</HI> confess'd it in their Fall.</L>
<L>Thy Streams, <HI>Caicus,</HI> rowl'd a Crimson-Flood;</L>
<L>And <HI>Thebes</HI> ran red with her own Natives Blood.</L>
<L>Twice <HI>Telephus</HI> employ'd their piercing Steel,</L>
<L>To wound him first, and afterward to heal.</L>
<L>The Vigour of this Arm was never vain:</L>
<L>And that my wonted Prowess I retain,</L>
<L>Witness these Heaps of Slaughter on the Plain.</L>
<L>He said; and, doubtful of his former Deeds,</L>
<L>To some new Trial of his Force proceeds.</L>
<L>He chose <HI>Menaetes</HI> from among the rest;</L>
<L>At him he lanch'd his Spear, and pierc'd his Breast:</L>
<L>On the hard Earth the <HI>Lycian</HI> knock'd his Head,</L>
<L>And lay supine; and forth the Spirit fled.</L>
<L>Then thus the Hero; Neither can I blame</L>
<L>The Hand, or Javelin; both are still the same.</L>
<L>The same I will employ against this Foe;</L>
<L>And wish but with the same Success to throw.</L>
<L>So spoke the Chief; and while he spoke he threw;</L>
<L>The Weapon with unerring Fury flew,</L>
<L>At his left Shoulder aim'd: Nor Entrance found;</L>
<L>But back, as from a Rock, with swift Rebound</L>
<L><PB N="413" REF="452"/>
Harmless return'd: A bloody Mark appear'd,</L>
<L>Which with false Joy the flatter'd Hero chear'd.</L>
<L>Wound there was none; the Blood that was in view,</L>
<L>The Lance before from slain <HI>Menaetes</HI> drew.</L>
<L>Headlong he leaps from off his lofty Car,</L>
<L>And in close Fight on Foot renews the War.</L>
<L>Raging with high Disdain, repeats his Blows;</L>
<L>Nor Shield nor Armour can their Force oppose;</L>
<L>Huge Cantlets of his Buckler strew the Ground,</L>
<L>And no Defence in his bor'd Arms is found.</L>
<L>But on his Flesh, no Wound or Blood is seen;</L>
<L>The Sword it self is blunted on the Skin.</L>
<L>This vain Attempt the Chief no longer bears;</L>
<L>But round his hollow Temples and his Ears</L>
<L>His Buckler beats: The Son of <HI>Neptune,</HI> stunn'd</L>
<L>With these repeated Buffets, quits his Ground;</L>
<L>A sickly Sweat succeeds, and Shades of Night;</L>
<L>Inverted Nature swims before his Sight:</L>
<L>Th' insulting Victor presses on the more,</L>
<L>And treads the Steps the Vanquish'd trod before.</L>
<L>Nor Rest, nor Respite gives. A Stone there lay</L>
<L>Behind his trembling Foe, and stopp'd his Way:</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> took th' Advantage which he found,</L>
<L>O'er-turn'd, and push'd him backward on the Ground.</L>
<L>His Buckler held him under, while he press'd,</L>
<L>With both his Knees above, his panting Breast.</L>
<L>Unlac'd his Helm: About his Chin the Twist</L>
<L>He ty'd; and soon the strangled Soul dismiss'd.</L>
<L>With eager Haste he went to strip the Dead:</L>
<L>The vanish'd Body from his Arms was fled.</L>
<L>His Sea-God Sire, t'immortalize his Frame,</L>
<L>Had turn'd it to the Bird that bears his Name.</L>

<L>The chief invited Guests were set around:</L>

<L>The mellow Harp did not their Ears employ:</L>

<L>Nor wanted I: The Roofs with Joy resound:</L>

<L>Rais'd Altars shone with holy Fires; the Bride,</L>

The Monster nought reply'd: For Words were vain;</L>
<L>And Deeds cou'd only Deeds unjust maintain:</L>
<L>But answers with his Hand; and forward press'd,</L>
<L>With Blows redoubled, on his Face and Breast.</L>
<L>An ample Goblet stood, of antick Mold,</L>
<L>And rough with Figures of the rising Gold;</L>
<L>The Hero snatch'd it up, and toss'd in Air,</L>
<L>Full at the Front of the foul Ravisher.</L>
<L>He falls; and falling vomits forth a Flood</L>
<L>Of Wine, and Foam and Brains, and mingled Blood.</L>

<L>Bold <HI>Amycus,</HI> from the robb'd Vestry brings</L>

<L>Of precious Weight: A Sconce, that hung on high,</L>
<L>With Tapers fill'd, to light the Sacristy,</L>
<L>Torn from the Cord, with his unhallow'd Hand</L>
<L>He threw amid the <HI>Lapythaean</HI> Band.</L>
<L>On <HI>Celadon</HI> the Ruin fell; and left</L>
<L>His Face of Feature and of Form bereft:</L>
<L>So, when some brawny Sacrificer knocks,</L>

<L>His Eye-balls rooted out, are thrown to Ground;</L>
<L>His Nose, dismantled, in his Mouth is found;</L>
<L>His Jaws, Cheeks, Front, one undistinguish'd Wound.</L>
<L>This, <HI>Belates,</HI> th' Avenger, cou'd not brook;</L>
<L>But, by the Foot, a Maple-board he took;</L>
<L>And hurl'd at <HI>Amycus</HI>; his Chin it bent</L>
<L>Against his Chest, and down the Centaur sent:</L>

Whom sputtring bloody Teeth, the second Blow</L>
<L>Of his drawn Sword, dispatch'd to Shades below.</L>
<L><HI>Grineus</HI> was near; and cast a furious Look</L>
<L>On the Side-Altar, cens'd with sacred Smoke,</L>
<L>And bright with flaming Fires; The Gods, he cry'd,</L>
<L>Have with their holy Trade our Hands supply'd:</L>
<L>Why use we not their Gifts? Then from the Floor</L>
<L>An Altar-Stone he heav'd, with all the Load it bore:</L>
<L>Altar and Altar's Freight together flew,</L>
<L>Where thickest throng'd the <HI>Lapythaean</HI> Crew:</L>
<L>And, at once, <HI>Broteas</HI> and <HI>Oryus</HI> slew.</L>

<L>The votive Horns of a Stag's branching Head:</L>
<L>At <HI>Grineus</HI> these he throws; so just they fly,</L>
<L>That the sharp Antlers stuck in either Eye:</L>
<L>Breathless and Blind he fell; with Blood besmear'd;</L>
<L>His Eye-balls beaten out, hung dangling on his Beard.</L>
<L>Fierce <HI>Rhaetus,</HI> from the Hearth a burning Brand</L>
<L>Selects, and whirling waves; till, from his Hand</L>
<L>The Fire took Flame; then dash'd it from the right,</L>
<L>On fair <HI>Charaxus</HI>' Temples, near the Sight:</L>
<L>The whistling Pest came on, and pierc'd the Bone,</L>
<L>And caught the yellow Hair, that shrivel'd while it shone.</L>
<L>Caught, like dry Stubble fir'd; or like Seerwood;</L>
<L>Yet from the Wound ensu'd no Purple Flood;</L>
<L>But look'd a bubbling Mass, of frying Blood.</L>
<L>His blazing Locks sent forth a crackling Sound;</L>
<L>And hiss'd, like red hot Iron within the Smithy drown'd.</L>

The wounded Warrior shook his flaming Hair,</L>
<L>Then (what a Team of Horse cou'd hardly rear)</L>
<L>He heaves the Threshold-Stone; but cou'd not throw;</L>
<L>The Weight it self forbad the threaten'd Blow;</L>
<L>Which dropping from his lifted Arms, came down</L>
<L>Full on <HI>Cometes</HI>' Head; and crush'd his Crown.</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Rhaetus</HI> then retain'd his Joy; but said,</L>

<L><HI>Rhaetus</HI> prevents what more he had to say;</L>
<L>And drove within his Mouth the fiery Death,</L>
<L>Which enter'd hissing in, and choak'd his Breath.</L>
<L>At <HI>Dryas</HI> next he flew: But weary Chance,</L>
<L>No longer wou'd the same Success advance.</L>
<L>For while he whirl'd in fiery Circles round</L>
<L>The Brand, a sharpen'd Stake strong <HI>Dryas</HI> found;</L>
<L>And in the Shoulder's Joint inflicts the Wound.</L>
<L>The Weapon stuck; which, roaring out with Pain,</L>
<L>He drew; nor longer durst the Fight maintain,</L>

<L>And <HI>Mermcros,</HI> in the late Race renown'd,</L>

<HI>Pholus</HI> and <HI>Melaneus</HI> from Fight withdrew,</L>

<L>Mean time strong <HI>Dryas</HI> urg'd his Chance so well,</L>

<L><HI>Lycus,</HI> and <HI>Chromys</HI> fell, by him oppress'd:</L>

<L>And crush'd an Ash beneath, that cou'd not bear his weight.</L>
<L>The shatter'd Tree receives his Fall; and strikes,</L>

And leaps aside; by <HI>Pallas</HI> warn'd, the Blow</L>

<L>Thy Sire, with grieving Eyes, beheld his Fate;</L>
<L>And cry'd, Not long, lov'd <HI>Crantor,</HI> shalt thou wait</L>

<L>His Ashen-Spear; which quiver'd, as it flew;</L>

<L>The sharp Point enter'd in the Centaur's Side:</L>
<L>Both Hands, to wrench it out, the Monster join'd;</L>

<L>And two, his Sword had slain, in closer War.</L>

His Hand it pass'd; and fix'd it to his Brow:</L>

<HEAD>The Fate of PERICLYMENOS.</HEAD>
<L>This Tale by <HI>Nestor</HI> told did much displease</L>
<L><HI>Tlepolemus</HI> the Seed of <HI>Hercules</HI>:</L>
<L>For, often he had heard his Father say,</L>
<L>That he himself was present at the Fray;</L>
<L>And more than shar'd the Glories of the Day.</L>
<L>Old Chronicle, he said, among the rest,</L>
<L>You might have nam'd <HI>Alcides</HI> at the least:</L>

<L>I wou'd have lost; but you renew the Wound:</L>
<L>Better to pass him o'er, than to relate</L>
<L>The Cause I have your mighty Sire to hate.</L>
<L>His Fame has fill'd the World, and reach'd the Sky;</L>
<L>(Which, Oh, I wish, with Truth, I cou'd deny!)</L>
<L>We praise not <HI>Hector</HI>; though his Name, we know,</L>

<L><HI>Elis,</HI> and <HI>Pylos</HI>; That a neighb'ring State,</L>

<L>All Youths of early Promise, had they liv'd;</L>

To him, our common Grandsire of the Main,</L>
<L>Had giv'n to change his Form, and chang'd, resume again.</L>
<L>Vary'd at Pleasure, every Shape he try'd;</L>
<L>And in all Beasts <HI>Alcides</HI> still defy'd:</L>
<L>Vanquish'd on Earth, at length he soar'd above;</L>
<L>Chang'd to the Bird, that bears the Bolt of <HI>Jove</HI>:</L>
<L>The new-dissembled Eagle, now endu'd</L>
<L>With Beak and Pounces, <HI>Hercules</HI> pursu'd,</L>
<L>And cuff'd his manly Cheeks, and tore his Face;</L>
<L>Then, safe retir'd, and tour'd in empty space.</L>
<L><HI>Alcides</HI> bore not long his flying Foe;</L>
<L>But bending his inevitable Bow,</L>
<L>Reach'd him in Air, suspended as he stood;</L>
<L>And in his Pinion fix'd the feather'd Wood.</L>
<L>Light was the Wound; but in the Sinew hung</L>
<L>The Point; and his disabled Wing unstrung.</L>
<L>He wheel'd in Air, and stretch'd his Vans in vain;</L>
<L>His Vans no longer cou'd his Flight sustain:</L>
<L>For while one gather'd Wind, one unsupply'd</L>
<L>Hung drooping down, nor pois'd his other Side.</L>
<L>He fell: The Shaft that slightly was impress'd,</L>
<L>Now from his heavy Fall with weight increas'd,</L>
<L>Drove through his Neck, aslant; he spurns the Ground,</L>
<L>And the Soul issues through the Weazon's Wound.</L>
<L>Now, brave Commander of the <HI>Rhodian</HI> Seas,</L>
<L>What Praise is due from me, to <HI>Hercules</HI>?</L>
<L>Silence is all the Vengeance I decree</L>
<L>For my slain Brothers; but 'tis Peace with thee.</L>

<L>His boiling Rage, he rowl'd his Eyes around</L>

<L>When I from <HI>Hector</HI>'s Hands redeem'd the flaming Prey.</L>

<L><PB N="436" REF="476"/>
By diff'rent Methods we maintain our Right,</L>
<L>Nor am I made to Talk, nor he to Fight.</L>
<L>In bloody Fields I labour to be great;</L>
<L>His Arms are a smooth Tongue, and soft Deceit:</L>
<L>Nor need I speak my Deeds, for those you see.</L>
<L>The Sun and Day are Witnesses for me.</L>
<L>Let him who fights unseen, relate his own,</L>
<L>And vouch the silent Stars, and conscious Moon.</L>
<L>Great is the Prize demanded, I confess,</L>
<L>But such an abject Rival makes it less;</L>
<L>That Gift, those Honours, he but hop'd to gain,</L>
<L>Can leave no room for <HI>Ajax</HI> to be vain:</L>
<L>Losing he wins, because his Name will be</L>
<L>Ennobled by Defeat, who durst contend with me.</L>
<L>Were my known Valour question'd, yet my Blood</L>
<L>Without that Plea wou'd make my Title good:</L>
<L>My Sire was <HI>Telamon,</HI> whose Arms, employ'd</L>
<L>With <HI>Hercules,</HI> these <HI>Trojan</HI> Walls destroy'd;</L>
<L>And who before with <HI>Jason,</HI> sent from <HI>Greece,</HI></L>
<L>In the first Ship brought home the Golden Fleece:</L>
<L>Great <HI>Telamon</HI> from <HI>Aeacus</HI> derives</L>
<L>His Birth (th' Inquisitor of guilty Lives</L>
<L>In Shades below; where <HI>Sisyphus,</HI> whose Son</L>
<L>This Thief is thought, rouls up the restless heavy Stone.)</L>
<L>Just <HI>Aeacus,</HI> the King of Gods above</L>
<L>Begot: Thus <HI>Ajax</HI> is the third from <HI>Jove.</HI></L>
<L>Nor shou'd I seek Advantage from my Line,</L>
<L>Unless (<HI>Achilles</HI>) it were mix'd with thine:</L>
<L>As next of Kin <HI>Achilles</HI>' Arms I claim;</L>
<L>This Fellow wou'd ingraft a Foreign Name</L>
<L>Upon our Stock, and the <HI>Sisyphian</HI> Seed</L>
<L>By Fraud and Theft asserts his Father's Breed:</L>
<L><PB N="437" REF="477"/>
Then must I lose these Arms, because I came</L>
<L>To fight uncall'd, a voluntary Name,</L>
<L>Nor shunn'd the Cause, but offer'd you my Aid,</L>
<L>While he long lurking was to War betray'd:</L>
<L>Forc'd to the Field he came, but in the Reer;</L>
<L>And feign'd Distraction to conceal his Fear:</L>
<L>Till one more cunning caught him in the Snare;</L>
<L>(Ill for himself) and dragg'd him into War.</L>
<L>Now let a Hero's Arms a Coward vest,</L>
<L>And he who shunn'd all Honours, gain the best:</L>
<L>And let me stand excluded from my Right,</L>
<L>Robb'd of my Kinsman's Arms, who first appear'd in Fight.</L>
<L>Better for us, at home had he remain'd,</L>
<L>Had it been true the Madness which he feign'd,</L>
<L>Or so believ'd; the less had been our Shame,</L>
<L>The less his counsell'd Crime, which brands the <HI>Grecian</HI> Name;</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Philoctetes</HI> had been left inclos'd</L>
<L>In a bare Isle, to Wants and Pains expos'd,</L>
<L>Where to the Rocks, with solitary Groans,</L>
<L>His Suff'rings and our Baseness he bemoans:</L>
<L>And wishes (so may Heav'n his Wish fulfill)</L>
<L>The due Reward to him who caus'd his Ill.</L>
<L>Now he, with us to <HI>Troy</HI>'s Destruction sworn,</L>
<L>Our Brother of the War, by whom are born</L>
<L><HI>Alcides</HI>' Arrows, pent in narrow Bounds,</L>
<L>With Cold and Hunger pinch'd, and pain'd with Wounds,</L>
<L>To find him Food and Cloathing, must employ</L>
<L>Against the Birds the Shafts due to the Fate of <HI>Troy.</HI></L>
<L>Yet still he lives, and lives from Treason free,</L>
<L>Because he left <HI>Ulysses</HI>' Company:</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Palamede</HI> might wish, so void of Aid,</L>
<L>Rather to have been left, than so to Death betray'd:</L>

The Coward bore the Man immortal Spight,</L>
<L>Who sham'd him out of Madness into Fight:</L>
<L>Nor daring otherwise to vent his Hate,</L>
<L>Accus'd him first of Treason to the State;</L>
<L>And then for proof produc'd the golden Store,</L>
<L>Himself had hidden in his Tent before:</L>
<L>Thus of two Champions he depriv'd our Host,</L>
<L>By Exile one, and one by Treason lost.</L>
<L>Thus fights <HI>Ulysses,</HI> thus his Fame extends,</L>
<L>A formidable Man, but to his Friends:</L>
<L>Great, for what Greatness is in Words and Sound,</L>
<L>Ev'n faithful <HI>Nestor</HI> less in both is found:</L>
<L>But that he might without a Rival reign,</L>
<L>He left this faithful <HI>Nestor</HI> on the Plain;</L>
<L>Forsook his Friend ev'n at his utmost Need,</L>
<L>Who tir'd, and tardy with his wounded Steed,</L>
<L>Cry'd out for Aid, and call'd him by his Name;</L>
<L>But Cowardice has neither Ears nor Shame:</L>
<L>Thus fled the good old Man, bereft of Aid,</L>
<L>And, for as much as lay in him, betray'd:</L>
<L>That this is not a Fable forg'd by me,</L>
<L>Like one of his, an <HI>Ulyssean</HI> Lie,</L>
<L>I vouch ev'n <HI>Diomede,</HI> who tho' his Friend,</L>
<L>Cannot that Act excuse, much less defend:</L>
<L>He call'd him back aloud, and tax'd his Fear;</L>
<L>And sure enough he heard, but durst not hear.</L>
<L>The Gods with equal Eyes on Mortals look,</L>
<L>He justly was forsaken, who forsook:</L>
<L>Wanted that Succour he refus'd to lend,</L>
<L>Found ev'ry Fellow such another Friend:</L>
<L>No wonder, if he roar'd that all might hear;</L>
<L>His Elocution was increas'd by Fear:</L>
<L><PB N="439" REF="479"/>
I heard, I ran, I found him out of Breath,</L>
<L>Pale, trembling, and half dead with fear of Death.</L>
<L>Though he had judg'd himself by his own Laws,</L>
<L>And stood condemn'd, I help'd the common Cause:</L>
<L>With my broad Buckler hid him from the Foe;</L>
<L>(Ev'n the Shield trembled as he lay below;)</L>
<L>And from impending Fate the Coward freed:</L>
<L>Good Heav'n forgive me for so bad a Deed!</L>
<L>If still he will persist, and urge the Strife,</L>
<L>First let him give me back his forfeit Life:</L>
<L>Let him return to that opprobrious Field;</L>
<L>Again creep under my protecting Shield:</L>
<L>Let him lie wounded, let the Foe be near,</L>
<L>And let his quiv'ring Heart confess his Fear;</L>
<L>There put him in the very Jaws of Fate;</L>
<L>And let him plead his Cause in that Estate:</L>
<L>And yet when snatch'd from Death, when from below</L>
<L>My lifted Shield I loos'd, and let him go;</L>
<L>Good Heav'ns, how light he rose, with what a bound</L>
<L>He sprung from Earth, forgetful of his Wound;</L>
<L>How fresh, how eager then his Feet to ply;</L>
<L>Who had not Strength to stand, had Speed to fly!</L>
<L><HI>Hector</HI> came on, and brought the Gods along;</L>
<L>Fear seiz'd alike the Feeble and the Strong:</L>

<L>Him, flesh'd with Slaughter, and with Conquest crown'd,</L>
<L>I met, and over-turn'd him to the Ground;</L>
<L>When after, matchless as he deem'd in Might,</L>
<L>He challeng'd all our Host to single Fight;</L>
<L>All Eyes were fix'd on me: The Lots were thrown;</L>
<L>But for your Champion I was wish'd alone:</L>
<L><PB N="440" REF="480"/>
Your Vows were heard; we fought, and neither yield;</L>
<L>Yet I return'd unvanquish'd from the Field.</L>
<L>With <HI>Jove</HI> to friend th' insulting <HI>Trojan</HI> came,</L>
<L>And menac'd us with Force, our Fleet with Flame:</L>
<L>Was it the Strength of this Tongue-valiant Lord,</L>
<L>In that black Hour, that sav'd you from the Sword?</L>
<L>Or was my Breast expos'd alone, to brave</L>
<L>A thousand Swords, a thousand Ships to save?</L>
<L>The hopes of your return! And can you yield,</L>
<L>For a sav'd Fleet, less than a single Shield?</L>
<L>Think it no Boast, O <HI>Grecians,</HI> if I deem</L>
<L>These Arms want <HI>Ajax,</HI> more than <HI>Ajax</HI> them;</L>
<L>Or, I with them an equal Honour share;</L>
<L>They honour'd to be worn, and I to wear.</L>
<L>Will he compare my Courage with his Sleight?</L>
<L>As well he may compare the Day with Night.</L>
<L>Night is indeed the Province of his Reign:</L>
<L>Yet all his dark Exploits no more contain</L>
<L>Than a Spy taken, and a Sleeper slain;</L>
<L>A Priest made Pris'ner, <HI>Pallas</HI> made a Prey:</L>
<L>But none of all these Actions done by Day:</L>
<L>Nor ought of these was done, and <HI>Diomede</HI> away.</L>
<L>If on such petty Merits you confer</L>
<L>So vast a Prize, let each his Portion share;</L>
<L>Make a just Dividend; and if not all,</L>
<L>The greater part to <HI>Diomede</HI> will fall.</L>
<L>But why for <HI>Ithacus</HI> such Arms as those,</L>
<L>Who naked and by Night invades his Foes?</L>
<L>The glitt'ring Helm by Moonlight will proclaim</L>
<L>The latent Robber, and prevent his Game:</L>
<L>Nor cou'd he hold his tott'ring Head upright</L>
<L>Beneath that Morion, or sustain the Weight;</L>
<L><PB N="441" REF="481"/>
Nor that right Arm cou'd toss the beamy Lance;</L>
<L>Much less the left that ampler Shield advance;</L>
<L>Pond'rous with precious Weight, and rough with Cost</L>
<L>Of the round World in rising Gold emboss'd.</L>
<L>That Orb would ill become his Hand to wield,</L>
<L>And look as for the Gold he stole the Shield;</L>
<L>Which, shou'd your Error on the Wretch bestow,</L>
<L>It would not frighten, but allure the Foe:</L>
<L>Why asks he, what avails him not in Fight,</L>
<L>And wou'd but cumber and retard his Flight,</L>
<L>In which his only Excellence is plac'd?</L>
<L>You give him Death, that intercept his Haste.</L>
<L>Add, that his own is yet a Maiden-Shield,</L>
<L>Nor the least Dint has suffer'd in the Field,</L>
<L>Guiltless of Fight: Mine batter'd, hew'd, and bor'd,</L>
<L>Worn out of Service, must forsake his Lord.</L>
<L>What farther need of Words our Right to scan?</L>
<L>My Arguments are Deeds, let Action speak the Man.</L>
<L>Since from a Champion's Arms the Strife arose,</L>
<L>So cast the glorious Prize amid the Foes;</L>
<L>Then send us to redeem both Arms and Shield,</L>
<L>And let him wear who wins 'em in the Field.</L>
<L>He said: A Murmur from a Multitude,</L>
<L>Or somewhat like a stifled Shout ensu'd:</L>
<L>Till from his Seat arose <HI>Laertes</HI>' Son,</L>

<L>And not without prepar'd Attention spoke:</L>
<L>Soft was his Tone, and sober was his Face;</L>
<L>Action his Words, and Words his Action grace.</L>

<L>Nor let my Wit, and wonted Eloquence,</L>
<L>Which often has been us'd in your Defence,</L>
<L>And in my own, this only time be brought</L>
<L>To bear against my self, and deem'd a Fault.</L>
<L>Make not a Crime, where Nature made it none;</L>
<L>For ev'ry Man may freely use his own.</L>
<L>The Deeds of long descended Ancestors</L>
<L>Are but by grace of Imputation ours,</L>
<L>Theirs in Effect; but since he draws his Line</L>
<L>From <HI>Jove,</HI> and seems to plead a Right Divine;</L>
<L>From <HI>Jove,</HI> like him, I claim my Pedigree,</L>
<L>And am descended in the same Degree:</L>
<L>My Sire <HI>Laertes</HI> was <HI>Arcesius</HI>' Heir,</L>
<L><HI>Arcesius</HI> was the Son of <HI>Jupiter</HI>:</L>
<L>No Parricide, no banish'd Man, is known</L>
<L>In all my Line: Let him excuse his own.</L>
<L><HI>Hermes</HI> ennobles too my Mother's Side,</L>
<L>By both my Parents to the Gods ally'd;</L>
<L><PB N="443" REF="483"/>
But not because that on the Female Part</L>
<L>My Blood is better, dare I claim Desert,</L>
<L>Or that my Sire from Parricide is free;</L>
<L>But judge by Merit betwixt Him and Me:</L>
<L>The Prize be to the best; provided yet</L>
<L>That <HI>Ajax</HI> for a while his Kin forget,</L>
<L>And his great Sire, and greater Uncle's Name,</L>
<L>To fortifie by them his feeble Claim:</L>
<L>Be Kindred and Relation laid aside,</L>
<L>And Honour's Cause by Laws of Honour try'd:</L>
<L>For if he plead Proximity of Blood;</L>
<L>That empty Title is with Ease withstood.</L>
<L><HI>Peleus,</HI> the Hero's Sire, more nigh than he,</L>
<L>And <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> his undoubted Progeny,</L>
<L>Inherit first these Trophies of the Field;</L>
<L>To <HI>Scyros,</HI> or to <HI>Phthia,</HI> send the Shield:</L>
<L>And <HI>Teucer</HI> has an Uncle's Right; yet he</L>
<L>Waves his Pretensions, nor contends with me.</L>
<L>Then since the Cause on pure Desert is plac'd,</L>
<L>Whence shall I take my rise, what reckon last?</L>
<L>I not presume on ev'ry Act to dwell,</L>
<L>But take these few, in order as they fell.</L>
<L><HI>Thetis,</HI> who knew the Fates, apply'd her Care</L>
<L>To keep <HI>Achilles</HI> in Disguise from War;</L>
<L>And till the threatning Influence were past,</L>
<L>A Woman's Habit on the Hero cast:</L>
<L>All Eyes were cozen'd by the borrow'd Vest,</L>
<L>And <HI>Ajax</HI> (never wiser than the rest)</L>
<L>Found no <HI>Pelides</HI> there: At length I came</L>
<L>With proffer'd Wares to this pretended Dame;</L>
<L>She, not discover'd by her Mien or Voice,</L>
<L>Betray'd her Manhood by her manly Choice;</L>
<L><PB N="444" REF="484"/>
And while on Female Toys her Fellows look,</L>
<L>Grasp'd in her Warlike Hand, a Javelin shook;</L>
<L>Whom, by this Act reveal'd, I thus bespoke:</L>
<L>O Goddess-born! resist not Heav'n's Decree,</L>
<L>The Fall of <HI>Ilium</HI> is reserv'd for Thee;</L>
<L>Then seiz'd him, and produc'd in open Light,</L>
<L>Sent blushing to the Field the fatal Knight.</L>
<L>Mine then are all his Actions of the War,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Telephus</HI> was conquer'd by my Spear,</L>
<L>And after cur'd: To me the <HI>Thebans</HI> owe</L>
<L><HI>Lesbos,</HI> and <HI>Tenedos,</HI> their overthrow;</L>
<L><HI>Syros</HI> and <HI>Cylla</HI>: Not on all to dwell,</L>
<L>By me <HI>Lyrnesus</HI> and strong <HI>Chrysa</HI> fell:</L>
<L>And since I sent the Man who <HI>Hector</HI> slew,</L>
<L>To me the noble <HI>Hector</HI>'s Death is due:</L>
<L>Those Arms I put into his living Hand,</L>
<L>Those Arms, <HI>Pelides</HI> dead, I now demand.</L>
<L>When <HI>Greece</HI> was injur'd in the <HI>Spartan</HI> Prince,</L>
<L>And met at <HI>Aulis</HI> to avenge th' Offence,</L>
<L>'Twas a dead Calm, or adverse Blasts, that reign'd,</L>
<L>And in the Port the Wind-bound Fleet detain'd:</L>
<L>Bad Signs were seen, and Oracles severe</L>
<L>Were daily thunder'd in our Gen'ral's Ear;</L>
<L>That by his Daughter's Blood we must appease</L>
<L><HI>Diana</HI>'s kindled Wrath, and free the Seas.</L>
<L>Affection, Int'rest, Fame, his Heart assail'd;</L>
<L>But soon the Father o'er the King prevail'd:</L>
<L>Bold, on himself he took the pious Crime,</L>
<L>As angry with the Gods, as they with him.</L>
<L>No Subject cou'd sustain their Sov'reign's Look,</L>
<L>Till this hard Enterprize I undertook:</L>
<L><PB N="445" REF="485"/>
I only durst th' Imperial Pow'r controul,</L>
<L>And undermin'd the Parent in his Soul;</L>
<L>Forc'd him t'exert the King for common Good,</L>
<L>And pay our Ransom with his Daughter's Blood.</L>
<L>Never was Cause more difficult to plead,</L>
<L>Than where the Judge against himself decreed:</L>
<L>Yet this I won by dint of Argument;</L>
<L>The Wrongs his injur'd Brother underwent,</L>
<L>And his own Office, sham'd him to consent.</L>
<L>'Twas harder yet to move the Mother's Mind,</L>
<L>And to this heavy Task was I design'd:</L>
<L>Reasons against her Love I knew were vain;</L>
<L>I circumvented whom I could not gain:</L>
<L>Had <HI>Ajax</HI> been employ'd, our slacken'd Sails</L>
<L>Had still at <HI>Aulis</HI> waited happy Gales.</L>
<L>Arriv'd at <HI>Troy,</HI> your Choice was fix'd on me,</L>
<L>A fearless Envoy, fit for a bold Embassy:</L>
<L>Secure, I enter'd through the hostile Court,</L>
<L>Glitt'ring with Steel, and crowded with Resort:</L>
<L>There, in the midst of Arms, I plead our Cause,</L>
<L>Urge the foul Rape, and violated Laws;</L>
<L>Accuse the Foes, as Authors of the Strife,</L>
<L>Reproach the Ravisher, demand the Wife.</L>
<L><HI>Priam, Antenor,</HI> and the wiser few,</L>
<L>I mov'd; but <HI>Paris</HI> and his lawless Crew</L>
<L>Scarce held their Hands, and lifted Swords; but stood</L>
<L>In Act to quench their impious Thirst of Blood:</L>
<L>This <HI>Menclaus</HI> knows; expos'd to share</L>
<L>With me the rough Preludium of the War.</L>
<L>Endless it were to tell what I have done,</L>
<L>In Arms, or Council, since the Siege begun:</L>
<L><PB N="446" REF="486"/>
The first Encounter's past, the Foe repell'd,</L>
<L>They skulk'd within the Town, we kept the Field.</L>
<L>War seem'd asleep for nine long Years; at length</L>
<L>Both Sides resolv'd to push, we try'd our Strength.</L>
<L>Now what did <HI>Ajax</HI> while our Arms took Breath,</L>
<L>Vers'd only in the gross mechanick Trade of Death?</L>
<L>If you require my Deeds, with ambush'd Arms</L>
<L>I trapp'd the Foe, or tir'd with false Alarms;</L>
<L>Secur'd the Ships, drew Lines along the Plain,</L>
<L>The Fainting chear'd, chastis'd the Rebel-train,</L>
<L>Provided Forage, our spent Arms renew'd;</L>
<L>Employ'd at home, or sent abroad, the common Cause pur∣su'd.</L>
<L>The King, deluded in a Dream by <HI>Jove,</HI></L>
<L>Despair'd to take the Town, and order'd to remove.</L>
<L>What Subject durst arraign the Pow'r Supream,</L>
<L>Producing <HI>Jove</HI> to justifie his Dream?</L>
<L><HI>Ajax</HI> might wish the Soldiers to retain</L>
<L>From shameful Flight, but Wishes were in vain:</L>
<L>As wanting of Effect had been his Words,</L>
<L>Such as of Course his thundring Tongue affords.</L>
<L>But did this Boaster threaten, did he pray,</L>
<L>Or by his own Example urge their Stay?</L>
<L>None, none of these, but ran himself away.</L>
<L>I saw him run, and was asham'd to see;</L>
<L>Who ply'd his Feet so fast to get aboard as He?</L>
<L>Then speeding through the Place, I made a stand,</L>
<L>And loudly cry'd, O base, degenerate Band,</L>
<L>To leave a Town already in your Hand!</L>
<L>After so long Expence of Blood, for Fame,</L>
<L>To bring home nothing but perpetual Shame!</L>
<L>These Words, or what I have forgotten since,</L>
<L>(For Grief inspir'd me then with Eloquence)</L>
<L><PB N="447" REF="487"/>
Reduc'd their Minds; they leave the crowded Port,</L>
<L>And to their late forsaken Camp resort:</L>
<L>Dismayd the Council met: This Man was there,</L>
<L>But mute, and not recover'd of his Fear:</L>
<L><HI>Thersites</HI> tax'd the King, and loudly rail'd,</L>
<L>But his wide opening Mouth with Blows I seal'd.</L>
<L>Then, rising, I excite their Souls to Fame,</L>
<L>And kindle sleeping Virtue into Flame.</L>
<L>From thence, whatever he perform'd in Fight</L>
<L>Is justly mine, who drew him back from Flight.</L>
<L>Which of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Chiefs consorts with Thee?</L>
<L>But <HI>Diomede</HI> desires my Company,</L>
<L>And still communicates his Praise with me.</L>
<L>As guided by a God, secure he goes,</L>
<L>Arm'd with my Fellowship, amid the Foes;</L>
<L>And sure no little Merit I may boast,</L>
<L>Whom such a Man selects from such an Hoast;</L>
<L>Unforc'd by Lots I went without affright,</L>
<L>To dare with him the Dangers of the Night:</L>
<L>On the same Errand sent, we met the Spy</L>
<L>Of <HI>Hector,</HI> double-tongu'd, and us'd to lie;</L>
<L>Him I dispatch'd, but not till undermin'd,</L>
<L>I drew him first to tell what treach'rous <HI>Troy</HI> design'd:</L>
<L>My Task perform'd, with Praise I had retir'd,</L>
<L>But not content with this, to greater Praise aspir'd.</L>
<L>Invaded <HI>Rhesus,</HI> and his <HI>Thracian</HI> Crew,</L>
<L>And him, and his, in their own Strength I slew:</L>
<L>Return'd a Victor, all my Vows compleat,</L>
<L>With the King's Chariot, in his Royal Seat:</L>
<L>Refuse me now his Arms, whose fiery Steeds</L>
<L>Were promis'd to the Spy for his Nocturnal Deeds:</L>
<L>And let dull <HI>Ajax</HI> bear away my Right,</L>
<L>When all his Days out-balance this one Night.</L>
<L><PB N="448" REF="488"/>
Nor fought I Darkling still: The Sun beheld</L>
<L>With slaughter'd <HI>Lycians</HI> when I strew'd the Field:</L>
<L>You saw, and counted as I pass'd along,</L>
<L><HI>Alastor, Chromius, Ceranos</HI> the Strong,</L>
<L><HI>Alcander, Prytanis,</HI> and <HI>Halius,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Noemon, Charopes,</HI> and <HI>Ennomus</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>Coon, Chersidamas</HI>; and five beside,</L>
<L>Men of obscure Descent, but Courage try'd:</L>
<L>All these this Hand laid breathless on the Ground;</L>
<L>Nor want I Proofs of many a manly Wound:</L>
<L>All honest, all before: Believe not me;</L>
<L>Words may deceive, but credit what you see.</L>
<L>At this he bar'd his Breast, and show'd his Scars,</L>
<L>As of a furrow'd Field, well plough'd with Wars;</L>
<L>Nor is this Part unexercis'd, said he;</L>
<L>That Gyant-bulk of his from Wounds is free:</L>
<L>Safe in his Shield he fears no Foe to try,</L>
<L>And better manages his Blood than I:</L>
<L>But this avails me not; our Boaster strove</L>
<L>Not with our Foes alone, but partial <HI>Jove,</HI></L>
<L>To save the Fleet: This I confess is true,</L>
<L>(Nor will I take from any Man his due:)</L>
<L>But thus assuming all, he robs from you.</L>
<L>Some part of Honour to your share will fall,</L>
<L>He did the best indeed, but did not all.</L>
<L><HI>Patroclus</HI> in <HI>Achilles</HI>' Arms, and thought</L>
<L>The Chief he seem'd, with equal Ardour fought;</L>
<L>Preserv'd the Fleet, repell'd the raging Fire,</L>
<L>And forc'd the fearful <HI>Trojans</HI> to retire.</L>
<L>But <HI>Ajax</HI> boasts, that he was only thought</L>
<L>A Match for <HI>Hector,</HI> who the Combat sought:</L>
<L><PB N="449" REF="489"/>
Sure he forgets the King, the Chiefs, and Me:</L>
<L>All were as eager for the Fight as He:</L>
<L>He but the ninth, and not by publick Voice,</L>
<L>Or ours preferr'd, was only Fortune's Choice:</L>
<L>They fought; nor can our Hero boast th' Event,</L>
<L>For <HI>Hector</HI> from the Field unwounded went.</L>
<L>Why am I forc'd to name that fatal Day,</L>
<L>That snatch'd the Prop and Pride of <HI>Greece</HI> away?</L>
<L>I saw <HI>Pelides</HI> sink, with pious Grief,</L>
<L>And ran in vain, alas! to his Relief;</L>
<L>For the brave Soul was fled: Full of my Friend</L>
<L>I rush'd amid the War, his Relicks to defend:</L>
<L>Nor ceas'd my Toil till I redeem'd the Prey,</L>
<L>And, loaded with <HI>Achilles,</HI> march'd away:</L>
<L>Those Arms, which on these Shoulders then I bore,</L>
<L>'Tis just you to these Shoulders should restore.</L>
<L>You see I want not Nerves, who cou'd sustain</L>
<L>The pond'rous Ruins of so great a Man:</L>
<L>Or if in others equal Force you find,</L>
<L>None is endu'd with a more grateful Mind.</L>
<L>Did <HI>Thetis</HI> then, ambitious in her Care,</L>
<L>These Arms thus labour'd for her Son prepare;</L>
<L>That <HI>Ajax</HI> after him the heav'nly Gift shou'd wear!</L>
<L>For that dull Soul to stare, with stupid Eyes,</L>
<L>On the learn'd unintelligible Prize!</L>
<L>What are to him the Sculptures of the Shield,</L>
<L>Heav'n's Planets, Earth, and Ocean's watry Field?</L>
<L>The <HI>Pleiads, Hyads</HI>; less, and greater <HI>Bear,</HI></L>
<L>Undipp'd in Seas; <HI>Orion</HI>'s angry Star;</L>
<L>Two diff'ring Cities, grav'd on either Hand;</L>
<L>Would he wear Arms he cannot understand?</L>

Beside, what wise Objections he prepares</L>
<L>Against my late Accession to the Wars?</L>
<L>Does not the Fool perceive his Argument</L>
<L>Is with more Force against <HI>Achilles</HI> bent?</L>
<L>For if Dissembling be so great a Crime,</L>
<L>The Fault is common, and the same in him:</L>
<L>And if he taxes both of long delay,</L>
<L>My Guilt is less, who sooner came away.</L>
<L>His pious Mother, anxious for his Life,</L>
<L>Detain'd her Son; and me, my pious Wife.</L>

<L>But grant me guilty, 'tis not much my Care,</L>
<L>When with so great a Man my Guilt I share:</L>
<L>My Wit to War the matchless Hero brought,</L>
<L>But by this Fool I never had been caught.</L>
<L>Nor need I wonder, that on me he threw</L>
<L>Such foul Aspersions, when he spares not you:</L>
<L>If <HI>Palamede</HI> unjustly fell by me,</L>
<L>Your Honour suffer'd in th' unjust Decree:</L>

<L>That <HI>Philoctetes</HI> is on <HI>Lemnos</HI> left,</L>
<L>Wounded, forlorn, of human Aid bereft,</L>
<L>Is not my Crime, or not my Crime alone;</L>
<L>Defend your Justice, for the Fact's your own:</L>
<L>'Tis true, th' Advice was mine; that staying there</L>

<L>He took the Counsel, and he lives at least;</L>
<L>Th' Event declares I counsell'd for the best:</L>

Though Faith is all, in Ministers of State;</L>
<L>For who can promise to be fortunate?</L>
<L>Now since his Arrows are the Fate of <HI>Troy,</HI></L>
<L>Do not my Wit, or weak Address, employ;</L>
<L>Send <HI>Ajax</HI> there, with his persuasive Sense,</L>
<L>To mollifie the Man, and draw him thence:</L>
<L>But <HI>Xanthus</HI> shall run backward; <HI>Ida</HI> stand</L>
<L>A leafless Mountain; and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Band</L>

Not only through a hostile Town to pass,</L>

<L>I ask'd no Friend, nor had, but him alone:</L>

<L>And Conduct were of War the better part,</L>
<L>And more avail'd than Strength, my valiant Friend</L>

<L>Which I have now reduc'd to Certainty;</L>

<HEAD>The Story of ACIS, POLYPHEMUS, and GALATEA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. DRYDEN.</BYLINE>
<L><HI>Acis,</HI> the lovely Youth, whose loss I mourn,</L>
<L>From <HI>Faunus</HI> and the Nymph <HI>Symethis</HI> born,</L>
<L>Was both his Parents Pleasure; but, to me</L>
<L>Was all that Love could make a Lover be.</L>
<L>The Gods our Minds in mutual Bands did join;</L>
<L>I was his only Joy, and he was mine.</L>
<L>Now sixteen Summers the sweet Youth had seen;</L>
<L>And doubtful Down began to shade his Chin:</L>
<L>When <HI>Polyphemus</HI> first disturb'd our Joy;</L>
<L>And lov'd me fiercely, as I lov'd the Boy.</L>
<L>Ask not which Passion in my Soul was high'r,</L>
<L>My last Aversion, or my first Desire:</L>
<L>Nor this the greater was, nor that the less;</L>
<L>Both were alike, for both were in Excess.</L>
<L>Thee, <HI>Venus,</HI> thee, both Heav'n and Earth obey;</L>
<L>Immense thy Pow'r, and boundless is thy Sway.</L>
<L>The <HI>Cyclops,</HI> who defy'd th' Aetherial Throne,</L>
<L>And thought no Thunder louder than his own,</L>
<L>The Terror of the Woods, and wilder far</L>
<L>Than Wolves in Plains, or Bears in Forests are,</L>
<L><PB N="471" REF="511"/>
Th' inhuman Host, who made his bloody Feasts</L>
<L>On mangl'd Members of his butcher'd Guests,</L>
<L>Yet felt the force of Love, and fierce Desire,</L>
<L>And burnt for me, with unrelenting Fire.</L>
<L>Forgot his Caverns, and his woolly Care,</L>
<L>Assum'd the Softness of a Lover's Air;</L>
<L>And comb'd, with Teeth of Rakes, his rugged Hair.</L>
<L>Now with a crooked Scythe his Beard he sleeks;</L>
<L>And mowes the stubborn Stubble of his Cheeks:</L>
<L>Now in the Crystal Stream he looks, to try</L>
<L>His Simagres, and rowls his glaring Eye.</L>
<L>His Cruelty and Thirst of Blood are lost;</L>
<L>And Ships securely sail along the Coast.</L>
<L>The Prophet <HI>Telemus</HI> (arriv'd by chance</L>
<L>Where <HI>Aetna</HI>'s Summets to the Seas advance,</L>
<L>Who mark'd the Tracts of every Bird that flew,</L>
<L>And sure Presages from their flying drew.)</L>
<L>Foretold the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> that <HI>Ulysses</HI>' Hand</L>
<L>In his broad Eye shou'd thrust a flaming Brand.</L>
<L>The Giant, with a scornful Grin reply'd,</L>
<L>Vain Augur, thou hast falsely Prophesy'd;</L>
<L>Already Love his flaming Brand has tost;</L>
<L>Looking on two fair Eyes, my Sight I lost.</L>
<L>Thus, warn'd in vain, with stalking Pace he strode,</L>
<L>And stamp'd the Margine of the briny Flood</L>
<L>With heavy Steps; and weary, sought agen</L>
<L>The cool Retirement of his gloomy Den.</L>
<L>A Promontory, sharp'ning by degrees,</L>
<L>Ends in a Wedge, and over-looks the Seas:</L>
<L>On either Side, below, the Water flows;</L>
<L>This airy Walk the Giant Lover chose.</L>
<L>Here, on the midst he sate; his Flocks, unled,</L>
<L>Their Shepherd follow'd, and securely fed.</L>
<L><PB N="472" REF="512"/>
A Pine so burly, and of Length so vast,</L>
<L>That sailing Ships requir'd it for a Mast,</L>
<L>He wielded for a Staff, his Steps to guide:</L>
<L>But laid it by, his Whistle while he try'd.</L>
<L>A hundred Reeds, of a prodigious Growth,</L>
<L>Scarce made a Pipe, proportion'd to his Mouth:</L>
<L>Which, when he gave it Wind, the Rocks around,</L>
<L>And watry Plains, the dreadful Hiss resound.</L>
<L>I heard the Ruffian-Shepherd rudely blow,</L>
<L>Where, in a hollow Cave, I sat below;</L>
<L>On <HI>Acis</HI>' Bosom I my Head reclin'd:</L>
<L>And still preserve the Poem in my Mind.</L>
<L>Oh lovely <HI>Galatea,</HI> whiter far</L>
<L>Than falling Snows, and rising Lilies are;</L>
<L>More flowry than the Meads, as Crystal bright,</L>
<L>Erect as Alders, and of equal height:</L>
<L>More wanton than a Kid, more sleek thy Skin</L>
<L>Than Orient Shells, that on the Shores are seen.</L>
<L>Than Apples fairer, when the Boughs they lade,</L>
<L>Pleasing as Winter Suns, or Summer Shade:</L>
<L>More grateful to the Sight, than goodly Plains;</L>
<L>And softer to the Touch, than Down of Swans;</L>
<L>Or Curds new turn'd: and sweeter to the Taste</L>
<L>Than swelling Grapes, that to the Vintage haste:</L>
<L>More clear than Ice, or running Streams, that stray</L>
<L>Through Garden Plots, but ah! more swift than they.</L>
<L>Yet, <HI>Galatea,</HI> harder to be broke</L>
<L>Than Bullocks, unreclaim'd, to bear the Yoke,</L>
<L>And far more stubborn than the knotted Oak:</L>
<L>Like sliding Streams, impossible to hold;</L>
<L>Like them fallacious, like their Fountains cold.</L>
<L>More warping than the Willow to decline</L>
<L>My warm Embrace, more brittle than the Vine;</L>
<L><PB N="473" REF="513"/>
Immoveable and fixt in thy Disdain;</L>
<L>Rough as these Rocks, and of a harder Grain.</L>
<L>More violent than is the rising Flood;</L>
<L>And the prais'd Peacock is not half so proud.</L>
<L>Fierce as the Fire, and sharp as Thistles are,</L>
<L>And more outragious than a Mother-Bear:</L>
<L>Deaf as the Billows to the Vows I make;</L>
<L>And more revengeful than a trodden Snake.</L>
<L>In Swiftness fleeter than the flying Hind,</L>
<L>Or driven Tempests, or the driving Wind.</L>
<L>All other Faults, with Patience I can bear;</L>
<L>But Swiftness is the Vice I only fear.</L>
<L>Yet if you knew me well, you wou'd not shun</L>
<L>My Love, but to my wish'd Embraces run:</L>
<L>Wou'd languish in your turn, and court my Stay;</L>
<L>And much repent of your unwise Delay.</L>
<L>My Palace, in the living Rock, is made</L>
<L>By Nature's Hand; a spacious pleasing Shade:</L>
<L>Which neither Heat can pierce, nor Cold invade.</L>
<L>My Garden fill'd with Fruits you may behold,</L>
<L>And Grapes in Clusters, imitating Gold;</L>
<L>Some blushing Bunches of a Purple Hue:</L>
<L>And these and those, are all reserv'd for you.</L>
<L>Red Strawberries, in Shades, expecting stand,</L>
<L>Proud to be gather'd by so white a Hand.</L>
<L>Autumnal Cornels, latter Fruit provide;</L>
<L>And Plumbs to tempt you, turn their glossy Side:</L>
<L>Not those of common kinds; but such alone</L>
<L>As in <HI>Phaeacian</HI> Orchards might have grown:</L>
<L>Nor Chestnuts shall be wanting to your Food,</L>
<L>Nor Garden-Fruits, nor Wildings of the Wood;</L>
<L><PB N="474" REF="514"/>
The laden Boughs for you alone shall bear;</L>
<L>And yours shall be the Product of the Year.</L>
<L>The Flocks you see, are all my own; beside</L>
<L>The rest that Woods, and winding Vallies hide;</L>
<L>And those that folded in the Caves abide.</L>
<L>Ask not the Numbers of my growing Store;</L>
<L>Who knows how many, knows he has no more.</L>
<L>Nor will I praise my Cattle; trust not me,</L>
<L>But judge your self, and pass your own Decree:</L>
<L>Behold their swelling Dugs; the sweepy Weight</L>
<L>Of Ewes that sink beneath the Milky Freight;</L>
<L>In the warm Folds, their tender Lambkins lye;</L>
<L>Apart from Kids, that call with human Cry.</L>
<L>New Milk in Nut-brown Bowls, is duely serv'd</L>
<L>For daily Drink; the rest for Cheese reserv'd.</L>
<L>Nor are these Houshold Dainties all my Store:</L>
<L>The Fields and Forests will afford us more;</L>
<L>The Deer, the Hare, the Goat, the Salvage Boar.</L>
<L>All sorts of Ven'son; and of Birds the best;</L>
<L>A pair of Turtles taken from the Nest.</L>
<L>I walk'd the Mountains, and two Cubs I found,</L>
<L>(Whose Dam had left 'em on the naked Ground,)</L>
<L>So like, that no Distinction cou'd be seen:</L>
<L>So pretty, they were Presents for a Queen;</L>
<L>And so they shall; I took 'em both away;</L>
<L>And keep, to be Companions of your Play.</L>
<L>Oh raise, fair Nymph, your Beauteous Face above</L>
<L>The Waves; nor scorn my Presents, and my Love.</L>
<L>Come, <HI>Galatea,</HI> come, and view my Face;</L>
<L>I late beheld it, in the watry Glass;</L>
<L>And found it lovelier than I fear'd it was.</L>
<L><PB N="475" REF="515"/>
Survey my towring Stature, and my Size:</L>
<L>Not <HI>Jove,</HI> the <HI>Jove</HI> you dream that rules the Skies,</L>
<L>Bears such a Bulk, or is so largely spread:</L>
<L>My Locks (the plenteous Harvest of my Head)</L>
<L>Hang o'er my manly Face; and dangling down,</L>
<L>As with a shady Grove, my Shoulders crown.</L>
<L>Nor think, because my Limbs and Body bear</L>
<L>A thick-set Underwood of bristling Hair,</L>
<L>My Shape deform'd; what fouler Sight can be,</L>
<L>Than the bald Branches of a leafless Tree?</L>
<L>Foul is the Steed, without a flowing Mane:</L>
<L>And Birds, without their Feathers and their Train.</L>
<L>Wool decks the Sheep; and Man receives a Grace</L>
<L>From bushy Limbs, and from a bearded Face.</L>
<L>My Forehead with a single Eye is fill'd,</L>
<L>Round as a Ball, and ample as a Shield.</L>
<L>The glorious Lamp of Heav'n, the radiant Sun,</L>
<L>Is Nature's Eye; and she's content with one.</L>
<L>Add, that my Father sways your Seas, and I,</L>
<L>Like you, am of the watry Family.</L>
<L>I make you his, in making you my own;</L>
<L>You I adore; and kneel to you alone:</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI> with his Fabled Thunder, I despise,</L>
<L>And only fear the Lightning of your Eyes.</L>
<L>Frown not, fair Nymph; yet I cou'd bear to be</L>
<L>Disdain'd, if others were disdain'd with me.</L>
<L>But to repulse the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> and prefer</L>
<L>The Love of <HI>Acis,</HI> (Heav'ns!) I cannot bear.</L>
<L>But let the Stripling please himself; nay more,</L>
<L>Please you, tho' that's the thing I most abhor;</L>

<L>These Giant Limbs endu'd with Giant Might.</L>
<L><PB N="476" REF="516"/>
His living Bowels, from his Belly torn,</L>
<L>And scatter'd Limbs, shall on the Flood be born:</L>
<L>Thy Flood, ungrateful Nymph; and Fate shall find</L>
<L>That way, for thee and <HI>Acis</HI> to be join'd.</L>
<L>For oh! I burn with Love, and thy Disdain</L>
<L>Augments at once my Passion, and my Pain.</L>
<L>Translated <HI>Aetna</HI> flames within my Heart,</L>
<L>And thou, Inhuman, wilt not ease my Smart.</L>
<L>Lamenting thus in vain, he rose, and strode</L>
<L>With furious Paces to the neighb'ring Wood:</L>
<L>Restless his Feet, distracted was his Walk;</L>
<L>Mad were his Motions, and confus'd his Talk.</L>
<L>Mad as the vanquish'd Bull, when forc'd to yield</L>
<L>His lovely Mistress, and forsake the Field.</L>
<L>Thus far unseen I saw: when fatal Chance</L>
<L>His Looks directing, with a sudden Glance,</L>
<L><HI>Acis</HI> and I were to his Sight betray'd;</L>
<L>Where nought suspecting we securely play'd.</L>
<L>From his wide Mouth a bellowing Cry he cast,</L>
<L>I see, I see; but this shall be your last:</L>
<L>A Roar so loud made <HI>Aetna</HI> to rebound:</L>
<L>And all the <HI>Cyclops</HI> labour'd in the Sound.</L>
<L>Affrighted with his monstrous Voice, I fled,</L>
<L>And in the Neighb'ring Ocean plung'd my Head.</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Acis</HI> turn'd his Back, and Help, he cry'd;</L>
<L>Help, <HI>Galatea,</HI> help, my Parent Gods,</L>
<L>And take me dying to your deep Abodes.</L>
<L>The <HI>Cyclops</HI> follow'd; but he sent before</L>
<L>A Rib, which from the living Rock he tore:</L>
<L>Though but an Angle reach'd him of the Stone,</L>
<L>The mighty Fragment was enough alone,</L>
<L><PB N="477" REF="517"/>
To crush all <HI>Acis</HI>; 'twas too late to save,</L>

<L>And rowl, among the River Gods, his Urn.</L>
<L>Straight issu'd from the Stone a Stream of Blood;</L>
<L>Which lost the Purple, mingling with the Flood.</L>
<L>Then, like a troubl'd Torrent, it appear'd:</L>
<L>The Torrent too, in little space, was clear'd.</L>
<L>The Stone was cleft, and through the yawning Chink</L>
<L>New Reeds arose, on the new River's Brink.</L>
<L>The Rock, from out its hollow Womb, disclos'd</L>
<L>A Sound like Water in its Course oppos'd.</L>
<L>When, (wondrous to behold,) full in the Flood,</L>
<L>Up starts a Youth, and Navel high he stood.</L>
<L>Horns from his Temples rise; and either Horn</L>
<L>Thick Wreaths, of Reeds, (his Native Growth) adorn.</L>
<L>Were not his Stature taller than before,</L>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> KING is sought to guide the growing State,</L>
<L>One able to support the Publick Weight,</L>
<L>And fill the Throne where <HI>Romulus</HI> had sate.</L>
<L>Renown, which oft bespeaks the Publick
Voice,</L>
<L>Had recommended <HI>Numa</HI> to their Choice:</L>
<L>A peaceful, pious Prince; who not content</L>
<L>To know the <HI>Sabine</HI> Rites, his Study bent</L>
<L>To cultivate his Mind; to learn the Laws</L>
<L>Of Nature, and explore their hidden Cause.</L>
<L>Urg'd by this Care, his Country he forsook,</L>
<L>And to <HI>Crotona</HI> thence his Journey took.</L>
<L>Arriv'd, he first enquir'd the Founder's Name</L>
<L>Of this new Colony; and whence he came.</L>
<L>Then thus a Senior of the Place replies,</L>
<L>(Well read, and curious of Antiquities)</L>
<L><PB N="510" REF="552"/>
'Tis said, <HI>Alcides</HI> hither took his way</L>
<L>From <HI>Spain,</HI> and drove along his conquer'd Prey;</L>
<L>Then, leaving in the Fields his grazing Cows,</L>
<L>He sought himself some hospitable House:</L>
<L>Good <HI>Croton</HI> entertain'd his Godlike Guest;</L>
<L>While he repair'd his weary Limbs with Rest.</L>
<L>The Hero, thence departing, bless'd the Place;</L>
<L>And here, he said, in Time's revolving Race,</L>
<L>A rising Town shall take his Name from thee.</L>
<L>Revolving Time fulfill'd the Prophecy:</L>
<L>For <HI>Myscelos,</HI> the justest Man on Earth,</L>
<L><HI>Alemon</HI>'s Son, at <HI>Argos</HI> had his Birth:</L>
<L>Him <HI>Hercules,</HI> arm'd with his Club of Oak,</L>
<L>O'ershadow'd in a Dream, and thus bespoke;</L>
<L>Go, leave thy Native Soil, and make Abode</L>
<L>Where <HI>Aesaris</HI> rowls down his rapid Flood:</L>
<L>He said; and Sleep forsook him, and the God.</L>
<L>Trembling he wak'd, and rose with anxious Heart;</L>
<L>His Country Laws forbad him to depart:</L>
<L>What shou'd he do? 'Twas Death to go away,</L>
<L>And the God menac'd if he dar'd to stay.</L>
<L>All Day he doubted, and when Night came on,</L>
<L>Sleep, and the same forewarning Dream, begun:</L>
<L>Once more the God stood threatning o'er his Head;</L>
<L>With added Curses if he disobey'd.</L>
<L>Twice warn'd, he study'd Flight; but wou'd convey,</L>
<L>At once, his Person and his Wealth away:</L>
<L>Thus while he linger'd, his Design was heard;</L>
<L>A speedy Process form'd, and Death declar'd.</L>
<L>Witness there needed none of his Offence;</L>
<L>Against himself the Wretch was Evidence:</L>
<L>Condemn'd, and destitute of human Aid,</L>
<L>To him, for whom he suffer'd, thus he pray'd.</L>
<L><PB N="511" REF="553"/>
O Pow'r, who hast deserv'd in Heav'n a Throne,</L>
<L>Not giv'n, but by thy Labours made thy own,</L>
<L>Pity thy Suppliant, and protect his Cause,</L>
<L>Whom thou hast made obnoxious to the Laws▪</L>
<L>A Custom was of old, and still remains;</L>
<L>Which Life or Death by Suffrages ordains:</L>
<L>White Stones and Black within an Urn are cast;</L>
<L>The first absolve, but Fate is in the last.</L>
<L>The Judges to the common Urn bequeath</L>
<L>Their Votes, and drop the Sable Signs of Death;</L>
<L>The Box receives all Black, but, pour'd from thence,</L>
<L>The Stones came candid forth; the Hue of Innocence.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Alemonides</HI> his Safety won,</L>
<L>Preserv'd from Death by <HI>Alcumena</HI>'s Son:</L>
<L>Then to his Kinsman-God his Vows he pays,</L>
<L>And cuts with prosp'rous Gales th' <HI>Ionian</HI> Seas:</L>
<L>He leaves <HI>Tarentum,</HI> favour'd by the Wind,</L>
<L>And <HI>Thurine</HI> Bays, and <HI>Temises,</HI> behind;</L>
<L>Soft <HI>Sybaris,</HI> and all the Capes that stand</L>
<L>Along the Shore, he makes in sight of Land;</L>
<L>Still doubling, and still coasting, till he found</L>
<L>The Mouth of <HI>Aesaris,</HI> and promis'd Ground;</L>
<L>Then saw where, on the Margin of the Flood,</L>
<L>The Tomb that held the Bones of <HI>Croton</HI> stood:</L>
<L>Here, by the Gods Command, he built and wall'd</L>
<L>The Place predicted; and <HI>Crotona</HI> call'd.</L>
<L>Thus Fame, from time to time, delivers down</L>
<L>The sure Tradition of th' <HI>Italian</HI> Town.</L>
<L>Here dwelt the Man divine, whom <HI>Samos</HI> bore,</L>
<L>But now Self-banish'd from his Native Shore,</L>
<L>Because he hated Tyrants, nor cou'd bear</L>
<L>The Chains which none but servile Souls will wear:</L>
<L><PB N="512" REF="554"/>
He, tho' from Heav'n remote, to Heav'n cou'd move▪</L>
<L>With Strength of Mind, and tread th' Abyss above;</L>
<L>And penetrate, with his interior Light,</L>
<L>Those upper Depths, which Nature hid from Sight:</L>
<L>And what he had observ'd, and learnt from thence▪</L>
<L>Lov'd in familiar Language to dispence,</L>
<L>The Crowd with silent Admiration stand,</L>
<L>And heard him, as they heard their God's Command;</L>
<L>While he discours'd of Heav'n's mysterious Laws,</L>
<L>The World's Original, and Nature's Cause;</L>
<L>And what was God; and why the fleecy Snows</L>
<L>In Silence fell, and rattling Winds arose;</L>
<L>What shook the stedfast Earth, and whence begun</L>
<L>The Dance of Planets round the radiant Sun;</L>
<L>If Thunder was the Voice of angry <HI>Jove,</HI></L>
<L>Or Clouds, with Nitre pregnant, burst above:</L>
<L>Of these, and Things beyond the common Reach,</L>
<L>He spoke, and charm'd his Audience with his Speech.</L>
<L>He first the Taste of Flesh from Tables drove,</L>
<L>And argu'd well, if Arguments cou'd move.</L>
<L>O Mortals, from your Fellows Blood abstain,</L>
<L>Nor taint your Bodies with a Food profane:</L>
<L>While Corn and Pulse by Nature are bestow'd,</L>
<L>And planted Orchards bend their willing Load;</L>
<L>While labour'd Gardens wholsom Herbs produce,</L>
<L>And teeming Vines afford their gen'rous Juice;</L>
<L>Nor tardier Fruits of cruder Kind are lost,</L>
<L>But tam'd with Fire, or mellow'd by the Frost;</L>
<L>While Kine to Pails distended Udders bring,</L>
<L>And Bees their Hony redolent of Spring;</L>
<L>While Earth not only can your Needs supply,</L>
<L>But, lavish of her Store, provides for Luxury;</L>
<L><PB N="513" REF="555"/>
A guiltless Feast administers with Ease,</L>
<L>And without Blood is prodigal to please.</L>
<L>Wild Beasts their Maws with their slain Brethren fill;</L>
<L>And yet not all, for some refuse to kill;</L>
<L>Sheep, Goats, and Oxen, and the nobler Steed,</L>
<L>On Browz, and Corn, and flow'ry Meadows, feed.</L>
<L>Bears, Tygers, Wolves, the Lyon's angry Brood,</L>
<L>Whom Heav'n endu'd with Principles of Blood,</L>
<L>He wisely sundred from the rest, to yell</L>
<L>In Forests, and in lonely Caves to dwell;</L>
<L>Where stronger Beasts oppress the Weak by Might,</L>
<L>And all in Prey and purple Feasts delight.</L>
<L>O impious Use! to Nature's Laws oppos'd,</L>
<L>Where Bowels are in other Bowels clos'd:</L>
<L>Where, fatten'd by their Fellow's Fat, they thrive;</L>
<L>Maintain'd by Murder, and by Death they live.</L>
<L>'Tis then for nought that Mother Earth provides</L>
<L>The Stores of all she shows, and all she hides,</L>
<L>If Men with fleshy Morsels must be fed,</L>
<L>And chaw with bloody Teeth the breathing Bread:</L>
<L>What else is this, but to devour our Guests,</L>
<L>And barb'rously renew <HI>Cyclopean</HI> Feasts!</L>
<L>We, by destroying Life, our Life sustain;</L>
<L>And gorge th' ungodly Maw with Meats obscene.</L>
<L>Not so the Golden Age, who fed on Fruit,</L>
<L>Nor durst with bloody Meals their Mouths pollute.</L>
<L>Then Birds in airy Space might safely move,</L>
<L>And tim'rous Hares on Heaths securely rove:</L>
<L>Nor needed Fish the guileful Hooks to fear,</L>
<L>For all was peaceful; and that Peace sincere.</L>
<L>Whoever was the Wretch (and curs'd be he)</L>
<L>That envy'd first our Food's Simplicity,</L>
<L><PB N="514" REF="556"/>
Th' Essay of bloody Feasts on Brutes began,</L>
<L>And after forg'd the Sword to murder Man.</L>
<L>Had he the sharpen'd Steel alone employ'd</L>
<L>On Beasts of Prey, that other Beasts destroy'd,</L>
<L>Or Man invaded with their Fangs and Paws,</L>
<L>This had been justify'd by Nature's Laws,</L>
<L>And Self-defence: But who did Feasts begin</L>
<L>Of Flesh, he stretch'd Necessity to Sin.</L>
<L>To kill Man-killers, Man has lawful Pow'r,</L>
<L>But not th' extended Licence, to devour.</L>
<L>Ill Habits gather by unseen Degrees,</L>
<L>As Brooks make Rivers, Rivers run to Seas.</L>
<L>The Sow, with her broad Snout, for rooting up</L>
<L>Th'intrusted Seed, was judg'd to spoil the Crop,</L>
<L>And intercept the sweating Farmer's Hope:</L>
<L>The covet'ous Churl, of unforgiving Kind,</L>
<L>Th' Offender to the bloody Priest resign'd:</L>
<L>Her Hunger was no Plea: For that she dy'd.</L>
<L>The Goat came next in order, to be try'd:</L>
<L>The Goat had cropt the Tendrills of the Vine:</L>
<L>In vengeance Laity and Clergy join,</L>
<L>Where one had lost his Profit, one his Wine.</L>
<L>Here was, at least, some Shadow of Offence:</L>
<L>The Sheep was sacrific'd on no Pretence,</L>
<L>But meek and unresisting Innocence.</L>
<L>A patient, useful Creature, born to bear</L>
<L>The warm and woolly Fleece, that cloath'd her Murderer;</L>
<L>And daily to give down the Milk she bred,</L>
<L>A Tribute for the Grass on which she fed.</L>
<L>Living, both Food and Rayment she supplies,</L>
<L>And is of least Advantage when she dies.</L>
<L>How did the toiling Oxe his Death deserve,</L>
<L>A downright simple Drudge, and born to serve?</L>

O Tyrant! with what Justice canst thou hope</L>
<L>The Promise of the Year, a plenteous Crop;</L>
<L>When thou destroy'st thy lab'ring Steer, who till'd,</L>
<L>And plough'd with Pains, thy else ungrateful Field?</L>
<L>From his yet reeking Neck to draw the Yoke,</L>
<L>That Neck with which the surly Clods he broke;</L>
<L>And to the Hatchet yield thy Husband-man,</L>
<L>Who finish'd Autumn, and the Spring began!</L>
<L>Nor this alone! but Heav'n it self to bribe,</L>
<L>We to the Gods our impious Acts ascribe:</L>
<L>First recompence with Death their Creatures Toil;</L>
<L>Then call the Bless'd above to share the Spoil:</L>
<L>The fairest Victim must the Pow'rs appease,</L>
<L>(So fatal 'tis sometimes too much to please!)</L>
<L>A purple Fillet his broad Brows adorns,</L>
<L>With flow'ry Garlands crown'd, and gilded Horns:</L>
<L>He hears the murd'rous Pray'r the Priest prefers,</L>
<L>But understands not, 'tis his Doom he hears:</L>
<L>Beholds the Meal betwixt his Temples cast,</L>
<L>(The Fruit and Product of his Labours past;)</L>
<L>And in the Water views perhaps the Knife</L>
<L>Uplifted, to deprive him of his Life;</L>
<L>Then broken up alive, his Entrails sees</L>
<L>Torn out, for Priests t'inspect the Gods Decrees.</L>
<L>From whence, O mortal Men, this Gust of Blood</L>
<L>Have you deriv'd, and interdicted Food?</L>
<L>Be taught by me this dire Delight to shun,</L>
<L>Warn'd by my Precepts, by my Practice won:</L>
<L>And when you eat the well-deserving Beast,</L>
<L>Think, on the Lab'rer of your Field you feast!</L>
<L>Now since the God inspires me to proceed▪</L>
<L>Be that, whate'er inspiring Pow'r, obey'd.</L>
<L><PB N="516" REF="558"/>
For I will sing of mighty Mysteries,</L>
<L>Of Truths conceal'd before, from human Eyes,</L>
<L>Dark Oracles unveil, and open all the Skies.</L>
<L>Pleas'd as I am to walk along the Sphere</L>
<L>Of shining Stars, and travel with the Year,</L>
<L>To leave the heavy Earth, and scale the Height</L>
<L>Of <HI>Atlas,</HI> who supports the heav'nly Weight;</L>
<L>To look from upper Light, and thence survey</L>
<L>Mistaken Mortals wandring from the Way,</L>
<L>And wanting Wisdom, fearful for the State</L>
<L>Of future Things, and trembling at their Fate!</L>
<L>Those I wou'd teach; and by right Reason bring</L>
<L>To think of Death, as but an idle Thing.</L>
<L>Why thus affrighted at an empty Name,</L>
<L>A Dream of Darkness, and fictitious Flame?</L>
<L>Vain Themes of Wit, which but in Poems pass,</L>
<L>And Fables of a World, that never was!</L>
<L>What feels the Body when the Soul expires,</L>
<L>By Time corrupted, or consum'd by Fires?</L>
<L>Nor dies the Spirit, but new Life repeats</L>
<L>In other Forms, and only changes Seats.</L>
<L>Ev'n I, who these mysterious Truths declare,</L>
<L>Was once <HI>Euphorbus</HI> in the <HI>Trojan</HI> War;</L>
<L>My Name and Lineage I remember well,</L>
<L>And how in Fight by <HI>Sparta</HI>'s King I fell.</L>
<L>In <HI>Argive Juno</HI>'s Fane I late beheld</L>
<L>My Buckler hung on high, and own'd my former Shield.</L>
<L>Then, Death, so call'd, is but old Matter dress'd</L>
<L>In some new Figure, and a vary'd Vest:</L>
<L>Thus all Things are but alter'd, nothing dies;</L>
<L>And here and there th' unbody'd Spirit flies,</L>
<L><PB N="517" REF="559"/>
By Time, or Force, or Sickness dispossest,</L>
<L>And lodges, where it lights, in Man or Beast;</L>
<L>Or hunts without, till ready Limbs it find,</L>
<L>And actuates those according to their Kind;</L>
<L>From Tenement to Tenement is toss'd,</L>
<L>The Soul is still the same, the Figure only lost:</L>
<L>And, as the soften'd Wax new Seals receives,</L>
<L>This Face assumes, and that Impression leaves;</L>
<L>Now call'd by one, now by another Name;</L>
<L>The Form is only chang'd, the Wax is still the same:</L>
<L>So Death, so call'd, can but the Form deface;</L>
<L>Th'immortal Soul flies out in empty Space,</L>
<L>To seek her Fortune in some other Place.</L>
<L>Then let not Piety be put to flight,</L>
<L>To please the Taste of Glutton Appetite;</L>
<L>But suffer inmate Souls secure to dwell,</L>
<L>Lest from their Seats your Parents you expel;</L>
<L>With rabid Hunger feed upon your Kind,</L>
<L>Or from a Beast dislodge a Brother's Mind.</L>
<L>And since, like <HI>Typhis</HI> parting from the Shore,</L>
<L>In ample Seas I sail, and Depths untry'd before,</L>
<L>This let me further add, That Nature knows</L>
<L>No stedfast Station, but, or Ebbs, or Flows:</L>
<L>Ever in Motion; she destroys her old,</L>
<L>And casts new Figures in another Mold.</L>
<L>Ev'n Times are in perpetual Flux, and run,</L>
<L>Like Rivers from their Fountain, rowling on.</L>
<L>For Time, no more than Streams, is at a Stay;</L>
<L>The flying Hour is ever on her Way:</L>
<L>And as the Fountain still supplies her Store,</L>
<L>The Wave behind impels the Wave before;</L>
<L><PB N="518" REF="560"/>
Thus in successive Course the Minutes run,</L>
<L>And urge their Predecessor Minutes on,</L>
<L>Still moving, ever new: For former Things</L>
<L>Are set aside, like abdicated Kings:</L>
<L>And every moment alters what is done,</L>
<L>And innovates some Act, till then unknown.</L>
<L>Darkness we see emerges into Light,</L>
<L>And shining Suns descend to Sable Night;</L>
<L>Ev'n Heav'n it self receives another Dye,</L>
<L>When weary'd Animals in Slumbers lie</L>
<L>Of Midnight Ease: Another, when the Gray</L>
<L>Of Morn preludes the Splendor of the Day.</L>
<L>The Disk of <HI>Phoebus,</HI> when he climbs on high,</L>
<L>Appears at first but as a bloodshot Eye;</L>
<L>And when his Chariot downward drives to Bed,</L>
<L>His Ball is with the same Suffusion red;</L>
<L>But mounted high in his Meridian Race</L>
<L>All bright he shines, and with a better Face:</L>
<L>For there, pure Particles of <HI>Aether</HI> flow,</L>
<L>Far from th'Infection of the World below.</L>
<L>Nor equal Light th'unequal Moon adorns,</L>
<L>Or in her wexing, or her waning Horns.</L>
<L>For ev'ry Day she wanes, her Face is less;</L>
<L>But gath'ring into Globe, she fattens at Increase.</L>
<L>Perceiv'st thou not the Process of the Year,</L>
<L>How the four Seasons in four Forms appear,</L>
<L>Resembling human Life in ev'ry Shape they wear?</L>
<L>Spring first, like Infancy, shoots out her Head,</L>
<L>With milky Juice requiring to be fed:</L>
<L>Helpless, tho' fresh, and wanting to be led.</L>
<L>The green Stem grows in Stature and in Size,</L>
<L>But only feeds with Hope the Farmer's Eyes;</L>
<L><PB N="519" REF="561"/>
Then laughs the childish Year with Flowrets crown'd,</L>
<L>And lavishly perfumes the Fields around,</L>
<L>But no substantial Nourishment receives;</L>
<L>Infirm the Stalks, unsolid are the Leaves.</L>
<L>Proceeding onward whence the Year began,</L>
<L>The Summer grows adult, and ripens into Man.</L>
<L>This Season, as in Men, is most repleat</L>
<L>With kindly Moisture, and prolifick Heat.</L>
<L>Autumn succeeds, a sober tepid Age,</L>
<L>Not froze with Fear, nor boiling into Rage;</L>
<L>More than mature, and tending to Decay,</L>
<L>When our brown Locks repine to mix with odious Grey.</L>
<L>Last, Winter creeps along with tardy Pace,</L>
<L>Sour is his Front, and furrow'd is his Face;</L>
<L>His Scalp if not dishonour'd quite of Hair,</L>
<L>The ragged Fleece is thin; and thin is worse than bare.</L>
<L>Ev'n our own Bodies daily Change receive,</L>
<L>Some Part of what was theirs before, they leave;</L>
<L>Nor are to-Day what Yesterday they were;</L>
<L>Nor the whole Same to-Morrow will appear.</L>
<L>Time was, when we were sow'd, and just began,</L>
<L>From some few fruitful Drops, the Promise of a Man:</L>
<L>Then Nature's Hand (fermented as it was)</L>
<L>Moulded to Shape the soft, coagulated Mass;</L>
<L>And when the little Man was fully form'd,</L>
<L>The breathless Embrio with a Spirit warm'd;</L>
<L>But when the Mother's Throws begin to come,</L>
<L>The Creature, pent within the narrow Room,</L>
<L>Breaks his blind Prison, pushing to repair</L>
<L>His stiffled Breath, and draw the living Air;</L>
<L>Cast on the Margin of the World he lies,</L>
<L>A helpless Babe, but by Instinct he cries.</L>
<L><PB N="520" REF="562"/>
He next essays to walk, but downward press'd</L>
<L>On four Feet imitates his Brother Beast:</L>
<L>By slow Degrees he gathers from the Ground</L>
<L>His Legs, and to the rowling Chair is bound;</L>
<L>Then walks alone; a Horseman now become,</L>
<L>He rides a Stick, and travels round the Room:</L>
<L>In time he vaunts among his youthful Peers,</L>
<L>Strong-bon'd, and strung with Nerves, in Pride of Years,</L>
<L>He runs with Mettle his first merry Stage,</L>
<L>Maintains the next, abated of his Rage,</L>
<L>But manages his Strength, and spares his Age.</L>
<L>Heavy the third, and stiff, he sinks apace,</L>
<L>And tho' 'tis down-hill all, but creeps along the Race.</L>
<L>Now sapless on the Verge of Death he stands,</L>
<L>Contemplating his former Feet, and Hands;</L>
<L>And, <HI>Milo</HI>-like, his slacken'd Sinews sees,</L>
<L>And wither'd Arms, once fit to cope with <HI>Hercules,</HI></L>
<L>Unable now to shake, much less to tear, the Trees.</L>
<L>So <HI>Helen</HI> wept, when her too faithful Glass</L>
<L>Reflected on her Eyes the Ruins of her Face:</L>
<L>Wondring what Charms her Ravishers cou'd spy,</L>
<L>To force her twice, or ev'n but once t'enjoy!</L>
<L>Thy Teeth, devouring Time, thine, envious Age,</L>
<L>On Things below still exercise your Rage:</L>
<L>With venom'd Grinders you corrupt your Meat,</L>
<L>And then, at lingring Meals, the Morsels eat.</L>
<L>Nor those, which Elements we call, abide,</L>
<L>Nor to this Figure, nor to that, are ty'd:</L>
<L>For this eternal World is said of Old,</L>
<L>But four prolifick Principles to hold,</L>
<L>Four different Bodies; two to Heav'n ascend,</L>
<L>And other two down to the Center tend:</L>
<L><PB N="521" REF="563"/>
Fire first with Wings expanded mounts on high,</L>
<L>Pure, void of Weight, and dwells in upper Sky;</L>
<L>Then Air, because unclog'd in empty Space,</L>
<L>Flies after Fire, and claims the second Place:</L>
<L>But weighty Water, as her Nature guides,</L>
<L>Lies on the lap of Earth; and Mother Earth subsides.</L>
<L>All Things are mix'd of these, which all contain,</L>
<L>And into these are all resolv'd again:</L>
<L>Earth rarifies to Dew, expanded more,</L>
<L>The subtil Dew in Air begins to soar;</L>
<L>Spreads as she flies, and weary of her Name</L>
<L>Extenuates still, and changes into Flame;</L>
<L>Thus having by degrees Perfection won,</L>
<L>Restless they soon untwist the Web they spun,</L>
<L>And Fire begins to lose her radiant Hue,</L>
<L>Mix'd with gross Air, and Air descends to Dew;</L>
<L>And Dew condensing, does her Form forego,</L>
<L>And sinks, a heavy lump of Earth, below.</L>
<L>Thus are their Figures never at a stand,</L>
<L>But chang'd by Nature's innovating Hand;</L>
<L>All Things are alter'd, nothing is destroy'd,</L>
<L>The shifted Scene for some new Show employ'd.</L>
<L>Then, to be born, is to begin to be</L>
<L>Some other Thing we were not formerly:</L>
<L>And what we call to Die, is not t'appear,</L>
<L>Or be the Thing that formerly we were.</L>
<L>Those very Elements which we partake,</L>
<L>Alive, when Dead some other Bodies make:</L>
<L>Translated grow, have Sense, or can Discourse;</L>
<L>But Death on deathless Substance has no Force.</L>
<L>That Forms are chang'd I grant; that nothing can</L>
<L>Continue in the Figure it began:</L>
<L><PB N="522" REF="564"/>
The golden Age, to Silver was debas'd:</L>
<L>To Copper that; our Mettal came at last.</L>
<L>The Face of Places, and their Forms, decay;</L>
<L>And that is solid Earth, that once was Sea:</L>
<L>Seas in their Turn retreating from the Shore,</L>
<L>Make solid Land, what Ocean was before;</L>
<L>And far from Strands are Shells of Fishes found,</L>
<L>And rusty Anchors fix'd on Mountain-Ground:</L>
<L>And what were Fields before, now wash'd and worn</L>
<L>By falling Floods from high, to Valleys turn,</L>
<L>And crumbling still descend to level Lands;</L>
<L>And Lakes, and trembling Bogs, are barren Sands:</L>
<L>And the parch'd Desart floats in Streams unknown;</L>
<L>Wondring to drink of Waters not her own.</L>
<L>Here Nature living Fountains opes; and there</L>
<L>Seals up the Wombs where living Fountains were;</L>
<L>Or Earthquakes stop their ancient Course, and bring</L>
<L>Diverted Streams to feed a distant Spring.</L>
<L>So <HI>Lycus,</HI> swallow'd up, is seen no more,</L>
<L>But far from thence knocks out another Door.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Erasinus</HI> dives; and blind in Earth</L>
<L>Runs on, and gropes his way to second Birth,</L>
<L>Starts up in <HI>Argos</HI> Meads, and shakes his Locks</L>
<L>Around the Fields, and fattens all the Flocks.</L>
<L>So <HI>Mysus</HI> by another way is led,</L>
<L>And, grown a River, now disdains his Head:</L>
<L>Forgets his humble Birth, his Name forsakes,</L>
<L>And the proud Title of <HI>Caicus</HI> takes.</L>
<L>Large <HI>Amenane,</HI> impure with yellow Sands,</L>
<L>Runs rapid often, and as often stands,</L>
<L>And here he threats the drunken Fields to drown;</L>
<L>And there his Dugs deny to give their Liquor down.</L>
<L><PB N="523" REF="565"/>
<HI>Anigros</HI> once did wholsome Draughts afford,</L>
<L>But now his deadly Waters are abhorr'd:</L>
<L>Since, hurt by <HI>Hercules,</HI> as Fame resounds,</L>
<L>The Centaurs in his Current wash'd their Wounds.</L>
<L>The Streams of <HI>Hypanis</HI> are sweet no more,</L>
<L>But brackish lose the Taste they had before.</L>
<L><HI>Antissa, Pharos, Tyre,</HI> in Seas were pent,</L>
<L>Once Isles, but now increase the Continent;</L>
<L>While the <HI>Leucadian</HI> Coast, main Land before,</L>
<L>By rushing Seas is sever'd from the Shore.</L>
<L>So <HI>Zancle</HI> to th' <HI>Italian</HI> Earth was ty'd,</L>
<L>And Men once walk'd where Ships at Anchor ride.</L>
<L>Till <HI>Neptune</HI> overlook'd the narrow Way,</L>
<L>And in Disdain pour'd in the conqu'ring Sea.</L>
<L>Two Cities that adorn'd th' <HI>Achaian</HI> Ground,</L>
<L><HI>Buris</HI> and <HI>Helice,</HI> no more are found,</L>
<L>But, whelm'd beneath a Lake, are sunk and drown'd;</L>
<L>And Boatsmen through the Chrystal Water show,</L>
<L>To wond'ring Passengers, the Walls below.</L>
<L>Near <HI>Traezen</HI> stands a Hill, expos'd in Air</L>
<L>To Winter-winds, of leafy Shadows bare:</L>
<L>This once was level Ground: But (strange to tell)</L>
<L>Th' included Vapours, that in Caverns dwell,</L>
<L>Lab'ring with Cholick Pangs, and close confin'd,</L>
<L>In vain sought Issue for the rumbling Wind:</L>
<L>Yet still they heav'd for Vent, and heaving still</L>
<L>Inlarg'd the Concave, and shot up the Hill;</L>
<L>As Breath extends a Bladder, or the Skins</L>
<L>Of Goats are blown t'inclose the hoarded Wines:</L>
<L>The Mountain yet retains a Mountain's Face,</L>
<L>And gather'd Rubbish heals the hollow Space.</L>
<L>Of many Wonders, which I heard or knew,</L>
<L>Retrenching most, I will relate but few:</L>
<L><PB N="524" REF="566"/>
What, are not Springs with Qualities oppos'd,</L>
<L>Endu'd at Seasons, and at Seasons lost?</L>
<L>Thrice in a Day thine, <HI>Ammon,</HI> change their Form,</L>
<L>Cold at high Noon, at Morn and Evening warm:</L>
<L>Thine, <HI>Athaman,</HI> will kindle Wood, if thrown</L>
<L>On the pil'd Earth, and in the waning Moon▪</L>
<L>The <HI>Thracians</HI> have a Stream, if any try</L>
<L>The Taste, his harden'd Bowels petrify;</L>
<L>Whate'er it touches it converts to Stones,</L>
<L>And makes a Marble Pavement where it runs.</L>
<L><HI>Crathis,</HI> and <HI>Sybaris</HI> her Sister Flood,</L>
<L>That slide through our <HI>Calabrian</HI> Neighbour Wood,</L>
<L>With Gold and Amber dye the shining Hair,</L>
<L>And thither Youth resort; (for who would not be Fair?)</L>
<L>But stranger Virtues yet in Streams we find,</L>
<L>Some change not only Bodies, but the Mind:</L>
<L>Who has not heard of <HI>Salmacis</HI> obscene,</L>
<L>Whose Waters into Women soften Men?</L>
<L>Or <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Lakes, which turn the Brain</L>
<L>To Madness, or in heavy Sleep constrain?</L>
<L><HI>Clytorian</HI> Streams the Love of Wine expel,</L>
<L>(Such is the Virtue of th' abstemious Well,)</L>
<L>Whether the colder Nymph that rules the Flood</L>
<L>Extinguishes, and balks the drunken God;</L>
<L>Or that <HI>Melampus</HI> (so have some assur'd)</L>
<L>When the mad <HI>Proetides</HI> with Charms he cur'd;</L>
<L>And pow'rful Herbs, both Charms and Simples cast</L>
<L>Into the sober Spring, where still their Virtues last.</L>
<L>Unlike Effects <HI>Lyncestis</HI> will produce;</L>
<L>Who drinks his Waters, tho' with moderate Use,</L>
<L>Reels as with Wine, and sees with double Sight:</L>
<L>His Heels too heavy, and his Head too light.</L>
<L><PB N="525" REF="567"/>
<HI>Ladon,</HI> once <HI>Pheneos,</HI> an <HI>Arcadian</HI> Stream,</L>
<L>(Ambiguous in th' Effects, as in the Name)</L>
<L>By Day is wholsome Bev'rage; but is thought</L>
<L>By Night infected, and a deadly Draught.</L>
<L>Thus running Rivers, and the standing Lake,</L>
<L>Now of these Virtues, now of those partake:</L>
<L>Time was (and all Things Time and Fate obey)</L>
<L>When fast <HI>Ortygia</HI> floated on the Sea;</L>
<L>Such were <HI>Cyanean</HI> Isles, when <HI>Typhis</HI> steer'd</L>
<L>Betwixt their Streights, and their Collision fear'd;</L>
<L>They swam where now they sit; and firmly join'd</L>
<L>Secure of rooting up, resist the Wind.</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Aetna</HI> vomiting sulphureous Fire</L>
<L>Will ever belsh; for Sulphur will expire,</L>
<L>(The Veins exhausted of the liquid Store:)</L>
<L>Time was she cast no Flames; in time will cast no more.</L>
<L>For whether Earth's an Animal, and Air</L>
<L>Imbibes; her Lungs with Coolness to repair,</L>
<L>And what she sucks remits; she still requires</L>
<L>Inlets for Air, and Outlets for her Fires;</L>
<L>When tortur'd with convulsive Fits she shakes,</L>
<L>That Motion choaks the Vent, till other Vent she makes:</L>
<L>Or when the Winds in hollow Caves are clos'd</L>
<L>And subtil Spirits find that Way oppos'd,</L>
<L>They toss up Flints in Air; the Flints that hide</L>
<L>The Seeds of Fire, thus toss'd in Air, collide,</L>
<L>Kindling the Sulphur, till the Fewel spent</L>
<L>The Cave is cool'd, and the fierce Winds relent.</L>
<L>Or whether Sulphur, catching Fire, feeds on</L>
<L>Its unctuous Parts, till all the Matter gone</L>
<L>The Flames no more ascend; for Earth supplies</L>
<L>The Fat that feeds them; and when Earth denies</L>
<L><PB N="526" REF="568"/>
That Food, by length of Time consum'd, the Fire</L>
<L>Famish'd for want of Fewel must expire.</L>
<L>A Race of Men there are, as Fame has told,</L>
<L>Who shiv'ring suffer <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Cold,</L>
<L>Till nine times bathing in <HI>Minerva</HI>'s Lake,</L>
<L>Soft Feathers, to defend their naked Sides, they take.</L>
<L>'Tis said, the <HI>Scythian</HI> Wives (believe who will)</L>

<L>Smear'd over with an Oil of wond'rous Might,</L>

<L>But this by sure Experiment we know,</L>

<L>Hide in a hollow Pit a slaughter'd Steer,</L>
<L>Bees from his putrid Bowels will appear;</L>
<L>Who like their Parents haunt the Fields, and bring</L>
<L>Their Hony-Harvest home, and hope another Spring.</L>
<L>The Warlike-Steed is multiply'd, we find,</L>

<L>Cut from a Crab his crooked Claws, and hide</L>
<L>The rest in Earth, a Scorpion thence will glide,</L>
<L>And shoot his Sting, his Tail in Circles toss'd</L>
<L>Refers the Limbs his backward Father lost:</L>
<L>And Worms, that stretch on Leaves their filmy Loom,</L>
<L>Crawl from their Bags, and Butterflies become.</L>
<L>Ev'n Slime begets the Frog's loquacious Race:</L>
<L>Short of their Feet at first, in little space</L>
<L>With Arms and Legs endu'd, long Leaps they take</L>
<L>Rais'd on their hinder Part, and swim the Lake,</L>
<L>And Waves repel: For Nature gives their Kind,</L>

<L>The Cubs of Bears a living Lump appear,</L>

<L><PB N="527" REF="569"/>
Their Mother licks 'em into Shape, and gives</L>
<L>As much of Form, as she her self receives.</L>
<L>The Grubs from their sexangular Abode</L>
<L>Crawl out unfinish'd, like the Maggot's Brood:</L>
<L>Trunks without Limbs; till time at leisure brings</L>
<L>The Thighs they wanted, and their tardy Wings.</L>
<L>The Bird who draws the Carr of <HI>Juno,</HI> vain</L>
<L>Of her crown'd Head, and of her Starry Train;</L>
<L>And he that bears th' Artillery of <HI>Jove,</HI></L>

<L>Which in the Spine, while he was living, ran;</L>
<L>When dead, the Pith corrupted will become</L>
<L>A Snake, and hiss within the hollow Tomb.</L>
<L>All these receive their Birth from other Things;</L>
<L>But from himself the <HI>Phoenix</HI> only springs:</L>

<L>In which he burn'd, Another and the Same;</L>

<L>While yet in tender Dew they drop their Tears.</L>
<L>He, (his five Centuries of Life fulfill'd)</L>
<L>His Nest on Oaken Boughs begins to build,</L>
<L>Or trembling Tops of Palm, and first he draws</L>
<L>The Plan with his broad Bill, and crooked Claws,</L>
<L>Nature's Artificers; on this the Pile</L>

<L>First catches, then consumes the costly Frame:</L>
<L>Consumes him too, as on the Pile he lies;</L>
<L>He liv'd on Odours, and in Odours dies.</L>
<L>An Infant-<HI>Phoenix</HI> from the former springs,</L>
<L>His Father's Heir, and from his tender Wings</L>
<L>Shakes off his Parent Dust, his Method he pursues,</L>
<L>And the same Lease of Life on the same Terms renews.</L>
<L>When grown to Manhood he begins his Reign,</L>
<L>And with stiff Pinions can his Flight sustain,</L>
<L>He lightens of its Load, the Tree that bore</L>
<L>His Father's Royal Sepulcher before,</L>
<L>And his own Cradle: This (with pious Care</L>
<L>Plac'd on his Back) he cuts the buxome Air,</L>

Nations and Empires flourish, and decay,</L>

<L>Thus <HI>Troy</HI> for ten long Years her Foes withstood,</L>

<L>And to the Gods directs these pious Pray'rs.</L>
<L>If this Portent be prosp'rous, O decree</L>
<L>To <HI>Rome</HI> th'Event; if otherwise, to me.</L>
<L>An Altar then of Turf he hastes to raise,</L>
<L>Rich Gums in fragrant Exhalations blaze;</L>

The panting Entrails crackle as they fry,</L>
<L>And boding Fumes pronounce a Mystery.</L>
<L>Soon as the Augur saw the Holy Fire,</L>
<L>And Victims with presaging Signs expire,</L>

<L>And views the horny Honours of his Head;</L>
<L>Then cry'd, Hail Conqueror! thy Call obey,</L>

<L>Better that I in Exile live abhorr'd,</L>

<L>Design'd by Destiny the Bane of <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>Two Horns (most strange to tell) his Temples crown;</L>

<L>A wasting Plague infected <HI>Latium</HI>'s Skies;</L>

<L>When <HI>Jove</HI>—In vain, fair Daughter, you assay</L>
<L>To o'er-rule Destiny's unconquer'd Sway:</L>
<L>Your Doubts to banish, enter <HI>Fate</HI>'s Abode;</L>
<L>A Privilege to heav'nly Powers allow'd;</L>
<L>There shall you see the Records grav'd, in length,</L>
<L>On Ir'n and solid Brass, with mighty Strength;</L>
<L>Which Heav'n's and Earth's Concussion shall endure;</L>
<L>Maugre all Shocks, eternal and secure:</L>
<L>There, on perennial Adamant design'd,</L>
<L>The various Fortunes of your Race you'll find:</L>
<L><PB N="546" REF="588"/>
Well I have mark'd 'em, and will now relate</L>
<L>To thee the settled Laws of future Fate.</L>
<L>He, Goddess, for whose Death the Fates you blame,</L>
<L>Has finish'd his determin'd Course with Fame:</L>
<L>To thee 'tis giv'n, at length, that he shall shine</L>
<L>Among the Gods, and grace the worship'd Shrine:</L>
<L>His Son to all his Greatness shall be Heir,</L>
<L>And worthily succeed to Empire's Care:</L>
<L>Our self will lead his Wars, resolv'd to aid</L>
<L>The brave Avenger of his Father's Shade:</L>
<L>To him its Freedom <HI>Mutina</HI> shall owe,</L>
<L>And <HI>Decius</HI> his auspicious Conduct know:</L>
<L>His dreadful Powers shall shake <HI>Pharsalia</HI>'s Plain,</L>
<L>And drench in Gore <HI>Philippi</HI>'s Fields again:</L>
<L>A mighty Leader, in <HI>Sicilia</HI>'s Flood,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Pompey</HI>'s warlike Son, shall be subdu'd:</L>
<L><HI>Aegypt</HI>'s soft Queen, adorn'd with fatal Charms,</L>
<L>Shall mourn her Soldier's unsuccessful Arms;</L>
<L>Too late shall find, her swelling Hopes were vain,</L>
<L>And know, that <HI>Rome</HI> o'er <HI>Memphis</HI> still must reign:</L>
<L>What name I <HI>Afric</HI> or <HI>Nile</HI>'s hidden Head?</L>
<L>Far as both Oceans roll, his Power shall spread:</L>
<L>All the known Earth to him shall Homage pay,</L>
<L>And the Seas own his universal Sway:</L>
<L>When cruel War no more disturbs Mankind;</L>
<L>To civil Studies shall he bend his Mind,</L>
<L>With equal Justice guardian Laws ordain,</L>
<L>And by his great Example Vice restrain:</L>
<L>Where will his Bounty or his Goodness end?</L>
<L>To Times unborn his gen'rous Views extend;</L>
<L>The Virtues of his Heir our Praise engage,</L>
<L>And promise Blessings to the coming Age:</L>
<L><PB N="547" REF="589"/>
Late shall he in his Kindred Orbs be placed,</L>
<L>With <HI>Pylian</HI> Years and crowded Honours graced.</L>
<L>Mean time, your Hero's fleeting Spirit bear,</L>
<L>Fresh from his Wounds, and change it to a Star:</L>
<L>So shall great <HI>Julius</HI> Rites divine assume,</L>
<L>And from the Skies eternal smile on <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>This spoke; the Goddess to the Senate flew;</L>
<L>Where, her fair Form conceal'd from mortal View,</L>
<L>Her <HI>Caesar</HI>'s heav'nly Part she made her Care,</L>
<L>Nor left the recent Soul to waste to Air;</L>
<L>But bore it upwards to its native Skies:</L>
<L>Glowing with new-born Fires she saw it rise;</L>
<L>Forth springing from her Bosom up it flew,</L>
<L>And kindling, as it soar'd, a Comet grew;</L>
<L>Above the Lunar Sphere it took its Flight,</L>
<L>And shot behind it a long Trail of Light.</L>
