<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Dresses of this nature are but
too often Petitions for Favours
to come. But the Intention
of this is to return thanks to your
Grace for the Favour you did me the
Honour to confer upon me in <HI>Novem∣ber</HI>
last. Your Grace, perhaps, may
inclin'd to believe, that my Ac∣knowledgment
comes somewhat of the
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
latest. I therefore being concern'd to
vindicate the Reputation of my Gra∣titude,
take the Liberty to assure your
Grace, that I knew nothing certainly
of the Favour, which by your Order
was conferr'd upon me in <HI>November</HI>
last, till within this Fortnight. And
as I had heard nothing certain of it,
till so long after your Grace had com∣manded
it; for that very Reason, I had
believ'd nothing of it, when I did hear
of it, if a Gentleman of undoubted
Honour had not assur'd me, that he
was present, when you were pleas'd to
give Directions about it. As I knew
nothing of it till within this Fortnight,
so all I know of it now, is the assurance
which that Gentleman has given me
that your Grace has ordered it. For,
tho, depending upon that Gentleman's
Honour and his Integrity, I have en∣deavour'd
to have Evidence of Sense
in the Case, as much as I could en∣deavour
it with any manner of De∣cency,
and without subjecting my self
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
to be treated, in my Messengers, with
repeated and intolerable Insolence, by
that Servant who receiv'd your Grace's
Command, to convey your Favour to
me, I have found to my infinite Sur∣prize,
that, at the very time that I
have been, labouring to unmask and
expose an Hypocritical, Wretch, who
has had the Impudence and the Ingra∣titude
publickly to affront your Grace,
as far, as Animals of his Species can
affront you; at that very time one of
your own Domestick Servants, your
errant Creature, who subsists entirely
by your Bounty, has been diligent
and industrious, in giving me all the
Disappointment, and all the Distur∣bance,
that, it has been in his, Power
to give me; and consequently all the
Diversion that he could possibly give
me in favour of your Grace's declar'd
and mortal Enemy.</P>
<P>But as your Grace's conferring this
Favour consisted in your ordering it to
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
be done, and not in my receiving
it, I am obliged to return you my
humble Thanks for it, as much as if
I were in actual Possession of it.</P>
<P>I am Very sorry that upon Addres∣sing
my self twice to your Grace af∣ter
this manner, I have been oblig'd
each time, to make a Complaint to
you. But I cannot absolutely des∣pair
of your Pardon for it, when I
consider that your Grace's Honour has
been more concern'd in each Com∣plaint
than any Inrerest of mine. Since
I made the first Complaint to you,
I have had the Satisfaction to see, that
your Grace has retriev'd the Jurisdi∣ction
over our <HI>Theatres,</HI> which is an∣nex'd
to your Office, as <HI>Lord Chamber∣lain</HI>
of his Majesty's <HI>Houshold;</HI> and
have had the Pleasure to hear that
you have mortify'd four Insolent Wret∣ches,
who had dar'd to usurp it from
you.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="7"/>
As for the Complaint which I lay
before you at present, I must leave it
to be determin'd by your Grace's Wis∣dom
and Justice, whether the Insolence
of the late <HI>Separate Ministry,</HI> whether
the Insolence of Sir <HI>John Edgar</HI> him∣self,
was ever so flagrant or so insup∣portable,
as that of your Domestick
and Menial Servant, who has presum'd
to abuse your Grace's Service in the
most Injurious Manner; to treat a Per∣son
insolently, whom you had treated
favourably; to intercept and retain
your Favour, and betray the Trust
repos'd in him, and to controul you
in your very Domain; where because
you are most independent, you ought
to be most uncontroulable.</P>
<P>My Lord, if your Grace should be
in the least surpriz'd at the uncom∣mon
Method of conveying this Com∣plaint
to you, I am inclin'd to believe
that you will have the Goodness to
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
consider, that the subject Matter of it
is a great deal more strange and more
extraordinary, than the manner of con∣veying
it to you. For I appeal to all
those Persons of Condition, who have
been us'd to receive Addresses of this
nature, if they ever knew, or ever
heard of any thing like it, in any of
their Servants before.</P>
<P>Besides, I had a great deal of Rea∣son
to believe, that I had no other
way of approaching your Grace. For
he who has had the Assurance for
four Months together, to intercept and
retain your Grace's Favour, would
certainly have ventur'd to intercept
any Letter that should have come
from me, or to hinder my having any
personal Access to you. But I believe
he dare hardly do that by the little
Book to which this is prefix'd, and
which I have here the Honour to send
you. If his Presumption should ex∣tend
so far, my Comfort is, that your
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
Grace will hear of the Contents of
this Epistle from a Hundred of your
Humble Servants.</P>

My Lord,
Your Grace's most obedient,

<HEAD>LETTER III. TO Sir John Edgar.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear KNIGHT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE I perceive that there is like
to be a long Commerce of Paper
Civilities between us two, I think
we could not do better, for the mak∣ing
the Correspondence perfectly
easie to us both, than to continue, as we have
begun, to throw off all manner of Ceremony,
and to treat each other with that Familiarity,
which is so becoming our long and old Acquain∣tance.
This is then one branch of the Cartel
establish'd between us, that thou should'st seem
not to remember that the King has made me a
Gentleman, and that I should not fail to forget
that he ever made thee a Knight. So that for
the future I shall be downright <HI>What d'ye call</HI>
with thee; and thou my dear Knight shalt be
plain <HI>Jack Edgar</HI> with me. In which branch of
the Cartel, thou hast by much the Advantage
of me. For my diminutive Honour was esta∣blishd
by no less than two Patents, the one
granted by the late Queen, and the other by His
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
present Majesty; whereas thine was conferr'd
only by a transitory Blow given upon Shoulder-blade;
which when some jeering malicious Per∣sons
heard of, they said, they rejoyc'd that Ho∣nour
was got so near as within a Foot of thy
<HI>Pericranium.</HI></P>
<P>But now to enter upon business; how agreea∣bly
was I surpriz'd with that notable Distinction
in the beginning of thy eleventh Paper, which
makes thy Apology for thy going by an <HI>Alias.</HI>
And that is, that when a Man goes by an <HI>alias,</HI> in
order to commit a Robbery, or a Murther, or lye,
with his Neighbour's Wife, why that is not so
well: But when an old Soldier of the Queen
takes up a <HI>nom-de-guerre,</HI> only for the promotion of
Virtue; why that is a laudable Action. Now here
cannot I forbear for my Life using the same ex∣pression
to you, which was formerly us'd to an∣other
old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thraso</HI> in the Eunuch of <HI>Terence.</HI></NOTE> Soldier. <HI>Dî vostram Fidem! Quanti
est sapere! Nunquam accedo, Quin abs te abeam Do∣ctior.</HI>
For my part, I have all along been weak
enough to believe, that to go by an <HI>alias</HI> is a ma∣nifest
Cheat, and that every Impostor means In∣terest
and not Virtue. But this notable Distin∣ction
has almost convinced me, that if the writer
of a Libel puts but a sham Name to it, he has a
Dispensation by that <HI>alias</HI> to injure, slander, and
threaten all that is Powerful and Noble in <HI>Great
Britain.</HI> But that if any one pretends to write
ev'n a just Satire, upon the vilest Poetaster
or Politicaster, between <HI>Dover</HI> and the <HI>Orcades</HI>
without putting any Name at all to it; why the
Action is abominable, it cries aloud for the ex∣tremest
Vengeance, and deserves Death without
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
Mercy. But, honest <HI>Jack Edgar,</HI> I have one
scruple in my Head. <HI>Boileau</HI> was certainly a
Man of true Judgment, of nice Honour and a
very just and admirable Satirist. His Censures
were always just, and so were his Praises, if you
except a very few addrest to his Great Monarch.
Merit and Virtue were always Sacred to him,
and Vice and Folly the objects of his Scorn and
Hatred. Now when he publish'd a Book of Sa∣tires,
which were chiefly levell'd at the <HI>Edgars</HI> and
<HI>Ironsides,</HI> who flourish'd then at <HI>Paris,</HI> that is, at a
number of Coxcombs who dar'd to appear upon
<HI>Parnassus,</HI> without any lawful Summons thither,
or in plain <HI>English,</HI> without either Genius or
Judgment, you know very well, <HI>Jack Edgar,</HI> that
he put no name to his Book.</P>
<P>The violence and virulence of the contending
Parties in <HI>England,</HI> have, I am afraid, been one
great cause, why we have had no just Satire in
<HI>England,</HI> since the Author of <HI>Hudibras</HI> publish'd
his, which seems to me, to be a very just one on
Hypocrisy. But you are not to be told, that the
Author of it put no Name to it. We have since
had Libels which have pass'd for Satires, as <HI>Absa∣lom</HI>
and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> the <HI>Medal, Mac Fleckno,</HI> and the
<HI>Dispensary.</HI> They are indeed, if you please,
beautiful Libels, but they are every where full
of Flattery or Slander, and a just Satire admits
of neither. In the two first, how many were
abus'd only for being true to the Religion and
Liberties of their Country? And on the other
side, some were extoll'd only for being false to
both. The attempt to lessen <HI>Shadwell</HI> in <HI>Mack∣flecno,</HI>
is every whit as unworthy of Satire. For
<HI>Shadwell</HI> pretended to no Species of Poetry but
the Comick, in which he was certainly very
much superiour to <HI>Dryden;</HI> as the latter acknow∣ledges
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
by a very fair implication in his <HI>Preface</HI> to
the <HI>State of Innocence,</HI> which was writ before
the Quarrel between them began. The business
of Sir <HI>Samuel Garth</HI> in his <HI>Dispensary</HI> was to ex∣pose
much better Physicians than himself, for no
other reason but because they were not of his Opi∣nion
in the affair of the <HI>Dispensary.</HI> Now tho'
these were Libels, and very injurious, yet the
Authors justly thought it more creditable to suf∣fer
them to be publish'd without any Name ra∣ther
than to make use of false ones.</P>
<P>I am heartily glad, my dear Friend, that I
have pleas'd thee so, by saying that thou hast
done more harm to the Stage, than any hundred
Men in all <HI>England.</HI> For say'st thou, the World
is so Wicked, that tis hardly a Disparagement to
be great ev'n in Ill. But I am afraid, honest <HI>Jack,</HI>
thou mistakest me. For when I accus'd thee of
doing this harm to the Stage, I did not affirm,
that thou didst it altogether through a sinister De∣sign,
or a wicked Motive of Interest; but that
there was always a mixture with the other two,
of want of Knowledge and Judgment. And
tho' it may be reputable in this wicked World to
be great in Ill, I believe it will hardly ever
be creditable to be great in Folly. I do not say,
but that there may be a very wise Man, who
may know nothing of Theatrical matters. But
then this Person who does not know them, must
not pretend to know them, nor to dictate to the
World in an affair which he does not at all un∣derstand.
For there is a wise and a knowing Ig∣norance,
an Ignorance that reflects upon its self,
and restrains him who has it from exposing or
hurting himself or others, by undertaking things
which he does not in the least understand.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14"/>
And now, my dear Friend, thou art for mount∣ing
that War Horse a-fresh, from which I shew'd
thee descending. Methinks I see thee upon him
in all thy Accoutrements, thy cock'd Hat, thy
broad Sword, thy Shoulder Belt, and thy Jack
Boots, and a hugeous merry Figure thou makest
upon him. But when thou talkest of planting
thy self behind King <HI>William</HI> the Third, against
<HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth, does not thy Memory fail
thee a little? If thou meanest planting thy self
behind the Coach of King <HI>William,</HI> I have no∣thing
to say against that. But I never heard a
great deal of thy attendance on him, when he
got on Horse-back. He seldom <HI>held</HI> the Honour
of thy Company, to express my self in the quaint
Dialect of thy elder Brother of <HI>Brentford,</HI> either
on the <HI>Boyne</HI> or the <HI>Shannon,</HI> or the <HI>Maese,</HI> or the
<HI>Sambre.</HI> Thou hadst that aversion for the effu∣sion
of Christian Blood, that rather than go into
the Field with thy broad Sword, and thy dead
doing Hand, to make piteous Slaughter of the
Enemy, thou mad'st it thy choice to stay here at
Home, and make wicked Jokes with thy <HI>Irish</HI>
Goose Quill, upon the Funerals of thy Friends.</P>
<P>But here my dear Friend, thou art in a terri∣ble
fuss about going to Law. Thou pretend'st to
be even Mad, that thou art hinder'd from going
to Law; the Law is not open to thee; thou hast
not the freedom of the Law. But, <HI>Quaere pere∣grinum
vicinia rauca reclamat.</HI> For do not we all
know that thou art up to the Ears in Law; that
thou hast been up to the Ears in Law these twenty
Years; and wilt be up to the Ears in Law, if thou
shouldst live these hundred Years? Can we for∣bear
laughing then, to hear thee cry out, that
thou shouldst be the happiest Man in the World,
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
if thou couldst but go to Law? Ah, my dear
Friend, I could name some certain Persons, who if
they were no more restrain'd from going to Law
than thou art, would be happy indeed. But
what is it that hinders thee from going to Law?
The Gate of Madam Justice, like that of Hell,
is open at all Hours. Free ingress is denyed to
none that have but Money to pay their Entrance;
Egress, I must confess, is not altogether To easie.
What is it then that thou pretendest should re∣strain
thee from going to Law? Hast thou not
Money to pay thy Lawyers? Or art thou suing
some unaccountable Debtors, who having Mo∣ney
to spare for their Liberalities and their Profu∣sions,
have that irregular greatness of Soul, that
they scorn to pay a just Debt till it comes to Ex∣ecution;
and who instead of discharging, or so
much as owning the Obligation they have to
thee, pretend to keep thee at Arms length, and
bid thee open Defiance? Should that be the Case,
I believe I can give thee wholsome Advice.
Know then, that there is a certain notable Ser∣jeant
at Law, with a hard Name, who, if thou
repairest to him, will instruct thee in an admira∣ble
Method of dealing with such Persons. But
at the same time I cannot help acquainting my
dear Friend, that he ought to be asham'd to
have the word Law in his Mouth, as long as he
pretends to undo an Act of the Legislature, by
an Act of the Executive Power.</P>
<P>We are come now from Law, by a Whirl of
Imagination, to Conjurers and Hoop Petticoats.
But why will you go abroad for Intelligence,
which you may have at home; or go for Coun∣sel
to the Deputy, when you may be advis'd by
the Principal? For does not every Mortal who
reads your Papers, say, the Devil in Hell is in
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
you? Besides, how come you so earnest to get
a Patent for the Hoop, which you were so
eager to demolish in your wonderful Specula∣tions?</P>
<P>But, my dear Friend, thou hast been pleas'd
in this thy eleventh Paper, to return the Title of
Pedant, by which I saluted thee in one of my
former, according to thy usual Method of giv∣ing
what is thy own, to those who do not in
the least deserve it. Tho' I plainly perceive that
thou art not quite so proud of this Title, as thou
art of that of <HI>Knight;</HI> yet to shew thee that I
saluted thee with proper Greeting, I shall en∣deavour
to prove, that however disagreeable
the Sound of Pedant may be to thee, thou art
certainly the Thing; and in order to this, will
endeavour to shew thee what a Pedant, and
Pedantry are, of which in thy Lucubrations and
Speculations thou hast so often treated
<Q><L>In proper terms, such as Men smatter,</L>
<L>When they throw out and miss the matter.</L>
<BIBL>Hud.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Pedant then is, literally and originally
speaking, he who has the Instruction of Boys;
and the Pedant in the figurative Appellation,
which is now come to be the common one, is
he who in his Conversations with Men, or in
his Writings to Men, shews the qualities of an
Instructor of Boys. Now Boys not being come
to the use of their Judgment, nor the force of
their Imagination, are chiefly instructed by Me∣mory.
Their Instructors therefore never argue
with them, but only dictate to them, and make
use of Authority instead of Reason with them.
And to exert their Authority the more, and to
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
cause it to make the stronger Impression, they
dictate with a haughty and imperious Air, which
sometimes is augmented to such a Degree, by
Weakness, Ill-Breeding, Pride and Choler, that
it becomes insupportable, even to their dearest
Friends and Relations. And if their Pupils are
backward in receiving their Instructions, or give
them the slightest Provocation, they treat them
with all those Flowers of Rhetorick, with which
those Persons are always inspir'd, who frequent
the sonorous Nymphs of the Floud, that haunt the
Banks of the vocal <HI>Thames</HI> between the <HI>Bridge</HI>
and the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I shewn, that the Pedant, in the
Acceptation in which the Word is commonly
us'd, has the same qualities with an Instructor
of Boys; the chief of which qualities are a dog∣matizing
Spirit, a presumptuous Arrogance, and
a soaring Insolence.</P>
<P>Now the Man of Sense, and the Gentleman,
being diametrically opposite to the Pedant, must
be one, who in his Conversations and in his Wri∣tings,
has the qualities of one who converses
with or writes to Men. Now he who knows
the World, and converses with, or writes to
Men, always Argues, and never Dictates; as
well knowing, that reasonable Creatures are to
be convinced by Reason, and not by Authority.
And as Reason and Truth are calm and modest
things, he never assumes the Dictatorian Air, is
never Haughty, never Insolent.</P>
<P>But if at any time, he barely asserts, he does
it with Modesty, if not with Diffidence; as very
well knowing, that, tho' a Man by an insolent
decisive Air, may pass upon those who are go∣vern'd
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
by Fancy or Opinion; it never fails to
render him suspected to those who are resolv'd
never to submit to any Opinion till they be con∣vinced
by Reason; which latter sort only may
be truly said to be Men. He therefore treats
his Companion or Reader with respect, and
would look upon it as a scandalous Indignity,
the breaking out into those Tropes and Figures
which are so much in use, with those who con∣verse
with, or who write to Boys, of what Age,
or Rank, or Condition whatsoever those Boys
are; whether they are in Infancy, or Youth, or
Virility, or Gravity or Decrepitude; whether they
are Ignorant or Learned Boys, of the Lees of the
People, or of Equestrian Dignity.</P>
<P>And now by applying all this to my very wor∣thy
Friend, I make no doubt but to make it ap∣pear,
not only that thou hast the Spirit of Pedan∣try
in thee, equal to any of thy Contemporaries
or Predecessours; but that thou hast by Nature
and Genius, what they have acquir'd by Indu∣stry
and hard Labour; (for thou art certainly an
illiterate Pedant) and art the very Cock Pedant
of all the Nest of Pedants. For besides, that in
all thy Writings, whether Papers or Pamphlets,
whether <HI>Lucubrations, Speculations, Guardian, Lo∣ver</HI>
or <HI>Englishman,</HI> I hardly ever knew thee argue
once; thou hast carried Authority to a more ri∣diculous
Height, than ever Pedant before thee
did. For if the rest of thy Brethren have had
the Extravagance, and the Presumption, to bear
down Human Reason, by downright Human Au∣thority,
they have still had so much shadow of
Modesty left, as to attempt it by the Authority
of others, and not by their own. If shoals of
modern Pedants have arriv'd to that height of
Extravagance, as to pretend to decide Disputes,
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
where Reason alone ought to prevail, by an <HI>Ipse
dixit;</HI> yet none before thy self has had the Ar∣rogance
and the Impudence to do it by an <HI>Ipse
dixi.</HI> But thou hast often set up thy own Autho∣rity,
not only against Human Reason, but a∣gainst
all other Human Authority. Thou hast
thought thy own dogmatick Assertion, enough
to establish any Opinion, which thy private In∣terest
requir'd; and like an Absolute Monarch
upon the Throne of Pedantry, hast believ'd it
sufficient to say, <HI>Car tel est notre plaisir.</HI></P>
<P>I must confess that several of the <HI>Tatlers</HI> have
Wit and Humour in them, a fine Raillery, and
an agreeable Pleasantry; and some of the <HI>Spec∣tators</HI>
likewise have some of these good Quali∣ties;
but I have powerful reasons to believe, that
for the most part the good Qualities in those
Writings are deriv'd from thy Correspondents,
and that only the Pedantry of them is thine. For
when thou endeavourdst to entertain the World
with a Paper call'd the <HI>Guardian,</HI> after that Mr.
<HI>Addison</HI> had abandon'd thee, and Mr. <HI>Manwaring</HI>
was entirely employ'd against the <HI>Examiner,</HI> I
found nothing in that Paper of the Qualities of
the other, but only thy eternal Dogmatizing,
and the haughty and pedantick Air of a School∣master.
Nay in this Paper thou wert dwindled
into a Pedant, even according to the Litteral
Acceptation of the Words; and appear'dst every
Morning with thy formal Instructors amidst thy
Boys and thy Girls.</P>
<P>I come next to the Vindication of thy Beauty.
But here, my dear <HI>Jacky</HI> Boy, let us be se∣rious
a little. Thou knowest I am thy Friend,
and wish thee well, I would not have thee make
thy self a Jest and a By-word, and a Butt to all
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
the World. Thy Beauty, Man! Why thou mayst
as well brag in thy old Age of thy Dancing a
Jig. I never heard thee mention'd by any Wo∣man,
for these three Years last past, but thou
either wentst by the Appellation of the Black
Knight with her, or she said she could resemble
thee to nothing so nearly as to the Knave of
<HI>Clubs.</HI> I receiv'd the following Letter from a
Friend, immediately upon the publication of the
11th and 12th <HI>Theatre.</HI></P>

write Letters to himself like other old Beaux,
from suppos'd Ladies, to vindicate what he

thee; I mean in the number of thy Creditors.
Thou hast ow'd me these two Years twelve <HI>Gui∣neas,</HI>
for the first Payment of twelve certain Re∣ceipts,
which upon taking the Receipts, thou
didst promise to pay in a Week. But since that
time, I never could see either the Money or the

the answer that <HI>Snug</HI> thy Servant would make,

<HEAD>LETTER IV. TO Sir John Edgar.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Excellent FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Come now to consider thy
twelfth Paper, in which thou
pretendst to Draw Pictures;
for which thou art just as much
Qualifyed as thou art to Cri∣ticize;
for to draw Characters,
and to Criticize, requires the
same Talent, that is, Judg∣ment,
which God and Nature have never vouch∣safed
to endow thee with. And therefore, all
who know thee an errant Bungler, that is, all who
do know thee, are very well satisfyed, that they
are no more to expect any more Resemblance
in thy Draughts, than from a Sign Post Painter,
nay, not the twentieth part so much. For no Sign
Post Painter was ever yet such a Blockhead, as
to Draw the Picture of a <HI>Rat,</HI> when he design'd
that of an <HI>Elephant;</HI> or to Draw the Figure of
an <HI>Elephant,</HI> when he design'd that of a <HI>Rat.</HI> But
now to whom is it not known, that thou hast gi∣ven
us the Picture, of a <HI>Wren,</HI> instead of that of
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
an <HI>Eagle;</HI> and the Picture of an <HI>Eagle,</HI> instead of
that of a <HI>Wren.</HI> And after thou hast call'd thy
dead Friend <HI>Wren,</HI> and thy self <HI>Eagle,</HI> does not
every Body know, that thou hast not the know∣ledge
of <HI>Adam</HI> in thee, nor art qualified to give
Names to Creatures agreeable to their Natures?
But as thou art able to draw no body, no body
can have any occasion to draw thee. Thy
Name alone is thy Picture, and comprehends as
severe and as entire a Satire in it as <HI>Boileau</HI> says
that of the <HI>Ass</HI> does.</P>
<Q><L>Dont le nom seul en soy comprend une Satire.</L></Q>
<P>Thou canst draw no Picture, but it wants a
Name to distinguish it; no one who names thee
has occasion to draw any Picture of thee.</P>
<P>What! art not thou the famous Distinguisher,
the celebrated Knower of the World, and of Me∣rit,
who art continually endeavouring to bes∣patter
and expose Ministers of State, of admi∣rable
Abilities; and who have done the most im∣portant
Services for their King, their Country,
and the whole Christian World; and among
whom, I have convincing Reasons to believe,
there are such, who are as much thy Superiours
in solid Learning, or in Polite Litterature; in
Wit, and graceful Court-like Behaviour, and the
fine Conversation of Gentlemen; as they are
above thee in Sagacity and Penetration, in the
profoundness of State Affairs, and the depths of
Politicks? Art thou, I say, the famous Distin∣guisher,
the celebrated Knower of the World,
and of Merit, who at the same time that thou
art vainly and impertinently endeavouring to ex∣pose
and ridicule these Illustrious Patriots, art
most ridiculously attempting to make two or
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
three paultry Players, pass upon the World
for Men of Manly, Generous, Elegant, Or∣namental
Qualities? After this need any one
care whom 'tis thou Censurest, and whom 'tis
thou Commendest? And yet to make thy Judg∣ment
manifest still further, at the same time
that thou art endeavouring to expose those whom
the King most confides in, and whom he most
values; thou art at every turn printing thy. insi∣pid
Madrigals in the Praise of His Majesty;
and still the Burthen of thy Song is the same with
that of an old <HI>Starling,</HI> who is moulting his bor∣row'd
Plumes in a Cage, Dick <HI>is a Bird for the
King!</HI> Dick <HI>is a Bird for the King!</HI> But how
much preferable to thine is the Song of the <HI>Star∣ling?</HI>
Tho it does not mean what it says, like
thee; yet it does not like thee, mean something
contrary to it. The Bird itself is not such a Beast
as not to know, that a Libel upon all a Man's
best Friends, can never be interpreted a Pane∣gyrick
upon the Man. Thus we see, that thou
never Censurest, and never Commendest by
Reason and by Judgment, because Reason and
Judgment are things which thou never hadst.
But thy Dislike, or Approbation, proceeds per∣petually
from thy Passions, thy Malice, and thy
Interest; but especially from the last, which is
thy great <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to an Error of thy Understand∣ing,
about which I shall use the more Words,
because thou sayst thou hast so often repeated it;
and that is, <HI>'tis generally for want of Judgment,
that Men set up for the Character of being Judicious.</HI></P>
<P>And here I cannot for my Soul forbear talk∣ing
to thee in the Language of thy Brother of
<HI>Brentford; Thou art mighty Ignorant poor Man, my
dear Friend is very Silly, I gad he is.</HI> For to what
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
purpose can this jingle of Words serve, but to
rattle in the Noddle of a <HI>wrong-headed</HI> Fellow?
For was there ever any Mortal who was not rec∣kon'd
a Beast and an Idiot by his own, Acquain∣tance,
but who set up for the Character of being
Judicious in the Profession which he had embra∣ced?
Does not a <HI>Shoe-maker,</HI> a <HI>Taylor,</HI> a <HI>Hosier,</HI>
set up for the Character of being Judicious in the
nature and fashion and make of Shoes and Stoc∣kings,
and Coats and Breeches and Cloaks?
Does not a <HI>Mercer</HI> set up for the Character of
being Judicious, in the nature, and fashion of
Stuffs and Silks, and Brocades? Does not a <HI>Stock∣Jobber,</HI>
or an <HI>Exchange Broker</HI> set up for the Cha∣racter
of being Judicious, in the Turns, the Rise
and Fall of the Publick Funds? When ten or
more <HI>Clergy-men</HI> Preach for a vacant Benefice,
does not each of them pretend to be more skil∣ful
and Judicious in the ways of Salvation, than
his other Antagonists? Wouldst thou Fee a Law∣yer
in an important Cause, who should tell thee
seriously, that he did not set up for having more
Judgment than his Neighbours in Statute and
Common Law? Wouldst thou trust thy Life up∣on
a dangerous Crisis, in the Hands of a Physi∣cian,
who should assure thee, that he had no
more Judgment in Physick than one of his Pa∣tients?
But to come to Authors, does not every
one who publishes a Book in any Art or Science,
pretend to instruct at least some of his Readers?
But which of his Readers can he pretend to In∣struct,
but those who are more Ignorant than
himself in the matters of which he treats? But
if he supposes that some of his Readers are more
Ignorant than himself in the matters of which
he treats, does not he set up for the Character
of being more Judicious in those matters than
they are?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="27"/>
When <HI>Copernicus</HI> publish'd his System of the
World, did not he pretend to a little more Judg∣ment
in <HI>Astronomy,</HI> than some who had gone be∣fore
him, and others who liv'd at the same time
with him, and who still adher'd to the <HI>Piolemaick</HI>
System? When <HI>Des Cartes</HI> publish'd his System of
Natural Philosophy, did not he by those won∣derful
Discoveries of the motion of the Earth,
and others, pretend to a little more Judg∣ment
in that Science, and to penetrate fur∣ther
into the Secrets of Nature than those who
had gone before him? When the Celebrated
<HI>Harvey</HI> gave the World his Treatise of the Circu∣lation
of the Blood, could he have oblig'd and
adorn'd the Common-wealth of Learning by that
noble and useful Discovery, if he had not set up
for the Character of having more Judgment in
<HI>Anatomy,</HI> than either his Predecessours, or his
Contemporaries? And when Sir <HI>Isac Newton,</HI>
whose Merit is above what the Muses themselves
can Commend, oblig'd and astonish'd the Learn∣ed
World by his Immortal and unparallel'd Trea∣tises;
those Treatises which have made him an
Honour to his Country, An Advancer of the no∣blest
Learning, and an Enlarger of the Empire
of the Mind; what, did he pretend to no more
Judgment in <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> than the herd of Ma∣thematicians?,</P>
<P>Is it not now most apparent, that every one
sets up for the Character of being Judicious in
his own Profession, and his own Art? Why then
should not that be allow'd to a Poet, which is
granted to all the rest? And why should it be
denyed by thee of all Men; and be denyed in
a Paper, in which you are doing the very same
thing which you pretend to ridicule in others?
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
For are not you pretending to write a Paper
here for the Improvement of-the Stage? And
how doest thou pretend to Improve it, by en∣deavouring
to impose upon the World according
to thy laudable Custom, and setting up for the
Character of being more Judicious in Theatri∣cal
matters, than most of your Readers; or by
speaking the Truth, and telling the World that
thou art a very Silly Fellow, and an eternal
Jabberer about, matters of which thou under∣standest
not a Syllable? What is become now of
that fine Maxim, <HI>that 'tis generally for want of
Judgment that Men set up for the Character of being
Judicious?</HI> Why thou errant Trisler! Thou ri∣diculous
<HI>Maxim Monger!</HI> Thou hast a hundred
such pretty Jingles in thy wonderful Specula∣tions,
I mean the Speculations which are pecu∣liarly
thine, and to which thou, hast let thy
Mark; Maxims which are calculated for Under∣standings
of the same Latitude with thine, and
which are under the same Elevation of Pole;
Maxims which shew'd thee as blind as <HI>Hector,</HI> or
<HI>Pompey,</HI> or <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Offspring, that came into the
World but Yesterday. But as I have now some
leisure to consider them, I will try, if by my lit∣tle
Art I can Couch the Cataracts of thy Under∣standing.</P>
<P>But the mischief of it is, that there is this dif∣ference
between a four Leg'd Puppy, and a two
Leg'd one; that whereas a four Leg'd one is Blind
but for nine Days, a two Leg'd one does not only
come into the World Blind, but for the most part
continues to be Blind, when he comes to be an
old Dog.</P>
<P>To this blessed Maxim, thou art pleas'd to
subjoyn these Words, <HI>Every body of any standing in
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
Town, knows that the dullest and most stupid Writers
we have had, have set up for Criticks;</HI> why yes
truly, this has been the Cant for forty Years, to∣gether,
among Persons of thy noble Under∣standing.
The Cry has gone round, that 'tis
impossible for any one who has shewn himself a
Critick by his Prose, to shew himself a good
Poet by his Verse; which was occasion'd first,
by the late Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s publishing a very dull
Tragedy of <HI>Edgar,</HI> after he had publish'd a Book
in Prose, in which there was a great deal of good
and just Criticism. 'Tis true indeed, <HI>Edgar</HI> was
so absurd a Monarch, that he seem'd to be a fore∣running
Type of thy self, who wert to strut up∣on
the Stage in the, succeeding Century, under
the same Heroick Name. From this accident,
the Poetasters of the Age, who believ'd it their
Interest to fix a Brand upon Criticism, immedi∣ately
cryed out, and made all their Disciples re∣peat
after them, that no Critick could be a Poet;
not considering that one of the greatest of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Poets, and, one of the greatest of the
<HI>French,</HI> were Criticks by Professon, as well as
Poets; <HI>and set up for the Character of being Judicious
in their own Art;</HI> nay, and had the Impudence
to appear publickly out of Humour with some
Popular Scriblers, who had had Success. But
to return to Mr. <HI>Rymer;</HI> whether that Gentle∣man's
ill Performance proceeded from his want
of Imagination, without which no Man can
make a Poet, let him have what Judgment he
will; or from his want of Exercise and Practice,
we should have been better able to determine,
if that Judicious Gentleman had writ more. If
Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s Tragedy is an ill one, neither <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>'s
or <HI>Ben. Johnson</HI>'s first Damatick Poems were
Master-pieces; and neither <HI>Ben</HI> nor <HI>Shakespear,</HI>
they had left nothing behind them but these,
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
would have pass'd with Posterity tor great Poets.
But whatever was the Reason of Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s Mis∣carriage,
if these Authors had only infer'd from
it, that a Man may sometimes have the Theory
of an Art, which yet he may not be fully qua∣lifyed
to practice with Success, nothing could
have been more just. But for them to draw not
only a general Inference from a particular Fact,
but an Inference so very absurd, as that a Man
cannot Practice an Art with Success, for no o∣ther
reason, but because he has shewn that he
Understands it, was Bestial and Abominable.
I am afraid, my dear Friend, that it will be found
upon enquiry, that the very contrary of this is
an eternal Truth. He who Practices an Art with
Success, which he does not understand, is most
infallibly an ill Artist, notwithstanding all his
Success; and is indebted for that Success, to the
gross Ignorance and Barbarity of those whom he
has the Luck to please.</P>
<P>If ever that Assertion, that the dullest and
most stupid Writers which we have had, have
set up for Criticks is prov'd it must be by thy Ex∣ample.
For as there is not one Author alive,
who has set up for Criticism so much as thou
hast, there is not in all <HI>Great Britain</HI> so stupid and
so dull a Writer as thou art, when thou art left to
thy self.</P>
<P>To make good both the Branches of this As∣sertion:
when old <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> publish'd his <HI>Tatlers,</HI>
did he set up for a Critick, did he set up for the
Character of being Judicious or not? Let us see
what he says himself in his Dedication to the late
Mr. <HI>Maynwaring.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31"/>
The general purpose of this Paper is to expose
the false Arts of Life, and to pull off the Dis∣guises
of Cunning, Vanity, and Affectation; and
to recommend a general Simplicity in our Dress,
our Discourse, and our Behaviour. No Man
has a better Judgment for the Discovery, or a
nobler Spirit for the Contempt of all Imposture,
than your self; which Qualities render you the
most proper Patron for the Author of these
Essays.</P>
<P>Thus far old <HI>Bickerstaff.</HI> Now this as I take
it, is setting▪ up for something more than the
Character of being barely Judicious; tis setting
up for Sagacity, tis setting up for Penetration,
which are the Accomplishments, and the Per∣fections
of Judgment. Now if it be true, that
'tis generally for want of Judgment, that a Man
sets up for the Character of being Judicious;
what shall we say of the Man who sets up for
the Character of Sagacity, for the Character of
Penetration? For such a one arrogates a hun∣dred
times more to himself, than one who sets up
for the Character of being barely Judicious in
passing his Judgment on the Works of Authors.
To know the Hearts of Men requires infinitely
more Capacity, than barely to know Books. A
Book alas, has but one meaning; whatever it
speaks it thinks. But the Heart of Man has Folds
and Doubles, and Recesses innumerable. Yet
thro' all these hast thou pretended to pierce, and
consequently hast pretended to Criticism, of a
nobler and more difficult Nature, than any Au∣thor
living. But though thou didst pretend to do
all this, what thou really didst of it was by the
Sagacity and Penetration of others. And when
thou hadst got ingenious Tools to write thee into
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
an Income of two Thousand Pounds a Year,
thou coulst not be satisfyed, till like the most
dull and stupid of all Writers thou hadst writ
thy self out of it again.</P>
<P>The Courtship which Sir <HI>Martin Mar-all</HI> made
to Mrs. <HI>Millesant,</HI> and that which thou didst
formerly make to Dame <HI>Fortune,</HI> and to Madam
<HI>Fame,</HI> will certainly make a Parallel that will
run upon all Four. Sir <HI>Martin</HI> had a mind to
Mrs. <HI>Millesant,</HI> but not having Capacity, nor Ad∣dress
to gain her, he prevail'd upon <HI>Warner</HI> to do
that for him, but to do it in such a way that Sir
<HI>Martin</HI> was to have the Credit and the Benefit of
it. Now the Lady being a Lover of Musick,
Sir <HI>Martin</HI> was to give her a Lesson upon the
<HI>Theorbo,</HI> and a Song. In order to this Sir <HI>Martin</HI> is
to appear in a Balcony, at a distance from her,
with a Lute in his Hand, and the Motions of a
Thrummer, and the Grimaces of a Singer, while
<HI>Warner</HI> is to Sing and to Play for him behind the
Curtain. Well! All this was very well concer∣ted;
but the Success of all was to depend upon
the Signal agreed upon between them, and that
was, that Sir <HI>Martin</HI> should leave off his Grima∣ces,
and his Thrummings upon his dumb Lute, up∣on
the Ringing of a Bell. But the foolish Knight
was so full of his Mistress and himself, that tho'
the Bell rung twice, yet his Hand and Jaws still
went, and expos'd him to the Scorn of his Mi∣stress
and the Chambermaid.</P>
<P>I will leave thee, my dear Friend, to apply all
this to thy self. But I cannot forbear taking no∣tice,
that it was very imprudent in thee not to
leave off upon the Bells ringing twice; that is,
upon the Bell that rung for Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s,
and Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Funeral.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="33"/>
I come now to some of the pretended Facts of
which thou hast been pleased to accuse me; and
I will begin with that which relates to Mr. <HI>Con∣greve</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> upon whom thou sayst I
have been more severe than upon any other Per∣sons.
As for being severe upon Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI>
tis a figure in Speech, which <HI>Jeremy</HI> says in <HI>Love
for Love,</HI> interlards the greatest part of his Con∣versation.
As for Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> I must confess,
I did write the <HI>Remarks upon Cato;</HI> but I did not
basely flatter and sawn upon Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> while
he was living, and then more basely insult him
as soon as he was Dead. I did not while he was
living, write a flattering fulsom Dedication to
him, in which I made him a Thousand times
greater than my self; and then as soon as he was
Dead write a flattering fulsom Dedication to my
self, in which I made my self a Thousand times
greater than him. A little below there is ano∣ther
extraordinary Figure, where thou pretendst
to insinuate that I have been us'd by some Peo∣ple
so as a Man of Honour ought not to be us'd.
Who are those People? Thou canst not, thou
darest not name them. Because then the Lye
would appear too gross and palpable. I'll tell
thee whom I have us'd at that rate, and that is,
thy Friend, thy Priest, thy Worshipper, thy
Viceroy. Thou either knowest or oughtest to
know that I have beat him; and I do not know
but I might have been provok'd to do as much
by his Wooden God, if he had dar'd to offer to
my Face, what he has basely writ. Thou sayst
that my Pamphlet is so cruel, that it could be
writ by none but a Coward. I believe I have gi∣ven
other sort of Proofs of my Courage, than
one who in the time of a Bloody War, for twen∣ty
Years together, took the King's Pay as a Sol∣dier
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
and never was in any Action; than one
who for twenty Years together fought as he writ,
by Proxy. The Cruelty of a Coward consists not
in Words but Actions: Then, then, was the
Cruelty, then was the Cowardice, when upon a
certain Night in <HI>November</HI> last, three villanous
Foot-Pads rob'd a poor defenceless Passenger of
all that he had, and said that they did it by a
Deputation from thee. And thou wert afterwards
pleas'd to abet this Action, and call those Foot-Pads,
Men of Manly, Elegant, Generous, Or∣namental
Qualities. <HI>Hinc illae Lachrymoe.</HI> From
hence arose those <HI>Crocodile</HI> Tears, which thou
hast shew'd in some of thy Papers.</P>
<P>Didst thou not snew thy Courage in a notable
manner, by giving such Language in thy <HI>Thea∣tres,</HI>
after having declar'd against single Combat
by thy Lucubrations, and against Siege and Bat∣tle
by thy Conduct? Was it not Bravely and He∣roically
done to call upon both the Living and the
Dead to revenge thy Cause upon one of Sixty
Five; and to endeavour to set both the <HI>King</HI>'s
Horse and Foot Guards upon one of Sixty Five?
For my part, I have always firmly believ'd, that
I have more true Courage than any one, than
whom I have more Understanding. For if For∣titude
is a Virtue, of which I know no Man who
doubts, it must depend upon the Reason and not
upon the Complexion; but if it depends upon
the Reason, then the stronger the Reason is, the
stronger must be the Virtue. And I have always
thought, that as God and Nature have given to
Man the Dominion over Beast, they have so far
given to reasonable Men the Dominion over
Blockheads, that they are rather born to scorn
them than to fear them. And I appeal to all my
Acquaintance in Town, of whom there are se∣veral
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
living of 30 and 40 Years standing, if these
Sentiments were ever contradicted by any Action
or Accident of my Life.</P>
<P>But if by the continual Fears thou hast given
me, thou meanst, as thou seemst to insinuate, my
apprehensions of Persons to whom I may owe
Money; thou of all Men hast as little reason to
upbraid me with these Fears as the others. For
who was it that lay skulking so many Years, at the
<HI>Tilt-yard Sutlers,</HI> when he was so strongly possess'd
with Fear, that he could not think himself in
safety, unless he had the Horse and Foot-Guards
for his Security? When the late facetious <HI>Daniel
Purcel</HI> gave him the name of Major General
<HI>Hide;</HI> and the chief Maxim of his Life seem'd to
be, <HI>Qui latuit bene vixit.</HI> If I had the Misfortune
to be an Insolvent Debtor, I should have this A∣pology
to make for my self, that my Insolvency
would not be owing to any Extravagance or
want of taking Pains, but to the hard, not
to say the unjust Usage which I have met with
in the World; and in great part to your Injustice
and Barbarity, and the Injustice and Barbarity
of those who deriv'd their Power from you. The
being an Insolvent Debtor, is rather to be pitied
than condemn'd, when it has not been occasion'd
either by Profuseness or Idleness, but tho being
in Debt is both odious and contemptible in one,
who is at the same time a Squanderer, a Bank∣rupt,
and an Oppressor. But yet to shew you
that I am not in the condition which you ima∣gine,
I have for these last four Years lodg'd con∣tinually
in the Neighbourhood of <HI>White-hall,</HI> and
I appeal to the Honourable Board of Greencloth,
if during that time, so much as one Complaint
as been preferr'd against me.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="36"/>
I should now say something of the Falshoods,
of which you accuse me, in my two former Let∣ters,
and of the Ingratitude of which thou pre∣tendest
to accuse me, for writing against those,
who have endeavour'd to serve me. As these
two Letters will be shortly follow'd by a <HI>Fifth</HI>
and a <HI>Sixth,</HI> I shall endeavour to shew in them,
who are the Lovers of Truth, and who are
the Slanderers, who are the Benefactors, and
who the Unjust and Oppressors. And then, if
with thy little Understanding, thou hast not lost
all Sense of Shame, I shall cause thy dusky Coun∣tenance
to turn Red, as the Morning does, or as
a <HI>Lobster</HI> boil'd.</P>
<P>But having said more already than I design'd
to do at present, and you having heard more
than thou hadst a mind to hear, I shall take my
leave for a little time; only adding, that as thou
hast form'd a Fantom in thy Mind, which thou
wouldst pass upon the World for thy Friend, and
which every impartial Man who has seen it, has
declar'd to be just as like to me, as a <HI>Wren</HI> is like
to the late Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> or as thou art like to an
<HI>Eagle;</HI> I shall, by way of Gratitude or Ac∣knowledgment,
subjoin to these Letters, the
Picture of my dear Friend; and I appeal to all
who shall see it, if I am not the happier Painter
of the two, and draw the livelier Resemblance.
And so at present, my very worthy Friend, I
heartily bid thee Farewel.</P>

<HEAD>THE

Sir John Edgar.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR <HI>John Edgar,</HI> the County of

broad Shoulders, thick Legs,
a Shape like the Picture of <HI>somebody</HI>
over a Farmers Chimney, a short
Chin, a short Nose, a short Forehead, a broad
flat Face, and a dusky Countenance. He us'd
to compare himself to an <HI>Eagle;</HI> and to oblige
the first Fool that he met with, to give it under
his Hand that he was so. But neither his Nose,
nor his Eyes, nor his Discernment, nor his
broad flat Face, nor his dusky Countenance
were held to be Aquiline. He was believ'd to
be in all these more like to another Bird than an
<HI>Eagle.</HI> Yet with such a Shape, and such a Face,
he discover'd at Sixty that, he took himself for a
Beauty, and appear'd to be more mortify'd upon
his being told he was Ugly, than he was by any
reflection that was ever made upon his Honour
or his Understanding.</P>

Country upon his Face, his Understanding,
his Writings, his Actions, his Passions, and above
all his Vanity. The <HI>Hibernian</HI> Brogue is still up∣on
all these, tho long Habitude and length of
Days have worn it from off his Tongue.</P>
<P>He is the greatest Pretender but one, of the
Age in which he lives; a Pretender both to Un∣derstanding
and Virtue, but especially to the lat∣ter,
But some malicious People have thought, that
he made constant Court to that venerable Lady,
not out of any Affection which he had for her
Person, but because he was struck by the Charms
of the Joynture which he believ'd might follow
her. And they were confirm'd in this Opinion,
by observing the Quarrels, which he had every
Day with one or other of her four Daughters.
Yet this pretended Passion did him great Service.
It was to him <HI>Major Domo, Factotum, Housekeeper,
Cook, Butler, Taylor</HI> and <HI>Sempstress;</HI> because we
live in a noble Climate, where Persons who are
universally known to be Cheats and Sharpers,
keep their Coaches by being so.</P>
<P>Yet to one of the Daughters of that venerable
Lady, he paid great respect in Publick, <HI>vide∣licet,</HI>
to Madam <HI>Justice.</HI> And to gain her Favour,
and obtain her Protection, he thought it not be∣neath
him, to admit the meanest of her Servants
and Officers into the greatest familiarity with
him. So that there was no respect of Persons a∣mong
them. But it was <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Tom,</HI> and
<HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Hal,</HI> and <HI>Dick</HI> with them. But he al∣ways
combin'd with these her Servants to injure
and abuse her in Private, and unknown to her
play'd a hundred Pranks with them to the preju∣dice
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
of her Interest and Reputation; which were
not long kept so very Private, but the World
took notice that neither he nor the Servants
car'd one Farthing for the Mistress they preten∣ded
to serve. He would very often do Extrava∣gant
things, very seldom Generous ones, and
never by his good will Just ones. Yet was he a
great pretender to Generosity; but Generosity
with him was squandring away his Money upon
Knaves and Fools who flatter'd him. Thus a
Bubble is a very generous Creature to the <HI>Shark</HI>
who preys upon him; and a Beggar is generous
to the Vermin that feed upon him.</P>
<P>He had that seeming respect for the Laws of
his Country, and appear'd to be so delighted
with them, that tho' he had the Happiness of
enjoying them as much as the most zealous of
his Fellow Subjects, even as those to whom one
may say, the Zeal of the Law hath eaten them
up; yet that he might be sure the Correspon∣dence
between them might be for Life, he had,
thro' a greatness of Soul peculiar to him, assum'd
a noble Resolution that would never suffer him
to pay any one a Farthing, 'till it came to Exe∣cution.
Yet notwithstanding all this he was not
satisfy'd; but was always crying out Law, Law,
more Law, more Law.</P>
<P>He appears to be mighty zealous for the Rights
of the People, and to be terribly afraid of the
return of the old Aristocracy, by which he has
got the nick Name with some of <HI>Aristocracy
Edgar.</HI> No Man had ever so much in his Mouth,
Benevolence and Beneficence to Mankind, as he;
which to his Creditors seems a great Fable: For,
say they, since he hates us who have most oblig'd
him, to that degree, that he cannot endure to
see our Faces, how can he possibly love the rest?
He us'd one while to call himself the <HI>Christian
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
Heroe,</HI> till it grew a publick Jest. For the Peo∣ple
would not allow him to be a Heroe, because,
tho he had been a Soldier so many Years in the
time of a Bloody War, he never had been present
either at Siege or Battle; and he could not possi∣bly,
they us'd to say, be a Christian, because he
us'd constantly to spend the Mornings in Cursing
<HI>the Houshold of Faith,</HI> tho' they came in shoals to
his Levees, out of pure Zeal to exhort him to
do his Duty.</P>
<P>He valued himself exceedingly, upon being a
great Improver, and a great Reformer, tho' the
truth of the matter is, that he never had half Skill
enough to improve any thing, nor half Virtue
enough to reform any thing. During the time
that he was Governour of the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> the
Diversions of that place were more Stupid and
Barbarous than ever they were known to be be∣fore,
and the wild Beasts more mischievous and
untractable. And he was especially so far from
Reforming any thing, that it was generally ob∣serv'd,
that the greater part of those who had
been most intimate with him, were very far from
being more Virtuous than their Neighbours;
tho' he never fail'd of doing one thing in order
to the making them so, and that is, entring them
in the School of Adversity.</P>
<P>Now as for <HI>Temperance,</HI> another Daughter of
the abovementioned venerable Lady, he caresses
and courts her all the live-long Day; and com∣pliments
her as the Queen of Morals, and the
Empress of Life. But as soon as the Night
approaches, then sparkling Champaign puts an
end to her Reign.</P>
<P>He judiciously believes, that by preaching Ab∣stinence
up by Day-light, he has made an ho∣nourable
Composition for his drinking three
Bottles by Candle-light.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="41"/>
We may say of his Fortitude, What <HI>Butler</HI> said
of <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s Wit; He may be Master of a very
great deal, but thro' abundance of Modest'y is
shie of making any Parade of it, but reserves it
for an occasion which no body can diving. For
he has declar'd against single Combat by his
Writings, and against Siege and Battle by his
Conduct and Actions, that is, by staying at home
in a time of War, with a Commission in a Penny∣less
Pocket, and choosing rather to run the Risk
of being taken Prisoner by the <HI>English,</HI> than of
being kill'd by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Now as for <HI>Prudence,</HI> the fourth Daughter, he
has a Magnanimity which teaches him utterly
to despise her, and to regard her as an abandon'd
Person, that prostitutes her self to the lowest
Mechanicks. He therefore makes it the business
of his Life to Affront her, and abuses her in all
his Conversation, his Writings and his Actions;
of which there can be ho stronger Testimony,
than his mortally disobliging his cordial tho' par∣tial
Friends who rais'd him, and going over to
a Party whom he had exasperated beyond any
possibility of a sincere Reconcilement.</P>
<P>He is so great a Friend to Union, that al∣most
all Orders and Ranks of Men are united in
his Person. For he has been Poet, Orator, Sol∣dier,
Officer, Projector, News-monger, Casuist,
Scribe, Politician, Fish monger, Knight▪ and
Gold finder; and what is never enough to be ad∣mir'd,
he has been all these, by virtue of other
Mens Capacities. Like a very Patentee, he has
perform'd the Functions of all these by Proxy,
and by Deputy. As an Author he Writ by Pro∣xy;
as a Soldier by proxy he fought; He is so
given to do every thing by Proxy and by De∣puty,
that one would swear he lies with his Mi∣stress
by Proxy and by Deputy, as several honest
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
worthy Gentlemen of his Antiquity are us'd to
lie with theirs.</P>
<P>Tho no Man in <HI>Great Britain</HI> is so fit a Subject
for Satire as himself, yet has he been always wri∣ting
Waggish Lampoons upon others. And when∣ever
he exposes a Lord in one of his Libels, he
has got a trick of affronting him ten times more
by way of begging his Pardon.</P>
<P>He has been always begging something of the
Government; and tho he has obtain'd ten times
more of it than he deserv'd, yet he grumbling
thinks they have given him nothing, because he
has retain'd nothing; and is outragiously angry
with some of the great Officers of the Crown, be∣cause
they have refus'd to wast the whole time of
their Administration in <HI>pouring Water into a Sieve.</HI></P>
<P>He had one while, as I hinted above, obtain'd
a Patent to be Governour of the, <HI>Bear-Garden;</HI> tho
that Patent was invalid and void, by vertue of a
previous Statute. Yet when he thought himself
establish'd in that Post, he chose a <HI>Bear,</HI> a <HI>Baboon,</HI>
and a <HI>Wolf</HI> for his Deputy Governours; but part∣ly
growing Lazy, and being partly convinc'd,
that the Deputies were fitter for Government than
the Principal, he abandon'd all to them; who con∣ducting
themselves by their Bestial Appetites,
play'd such Pranks, that both Governours and
Deputies were all remov'd, and the <HI>Bear-Garden</HI>
turn'd into a <HI>Theatre.</HI> Which Conduct of his puts
me in mind of one <HI>Sempronius</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Knight,
who was made Director of the <HI>Ludi Fescennini,</HI> a
rough sort of <HI>Bear-Garden</HI> Drama, in use among
the uncultivated <HI>Romans,</HI> before they were po∣lish'd
by the <HI>Grecian</HI> Arts; into which Employ∣ment
he introduc'd three Wretches as his Depu∣ties,
who were the utter ruin of that Diversion.
For thess four Persons had not among them all
as much Judgment as a <HI>Ballad maker.</HI> And yet
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
upon having this paultry Office conferr'd upon
him, <HI>Sempronius</HI> most vainly and impertinently
usurp'd the name of <HI>Censor;</HI> which coming to a∣larm
the true <HI>Censors,</HI> they enquir'd into his Life,
upon which finding him to be the greatest <HI>Fourbe,</HI>
and the greatest Impostor, that had appear'd a∣mong
them since the Foundation of the City,
they turn'd him with Disgrace out of his Govern∣ment,
dismounted him, and took his Horse from
him; and not contented with this, banish'd him
from <HI>Rome</HI> it self; and upon his Departure, caus'd
the same general Lustration to be made, that was
us'd, when a certain boding, broad, flat, dusky∣fac'd
Prodigy had been hooted from out the
Walls.</P>

<P>IF upon perusing this piece of Painting, or
upon reading, the preceeding Letters, any
honest impartial Gentlemen shall say, as they
did upon reading the two Former, that I ought
not to enter into the private Concerns of Life;
I desire them to consider, that these Letters, tho
written in Prose, were design'd to be Just and Le∣gitimate
Satires; and that the private Concerns
of Life are the just and adaequate Subjects of
Satire, and make the chief Beauties of the an∣cient
Satirists, that is, of <HI>Lucilius, Horace, Per∣sius</HI>
and <HI>Juvenal.</HI></P>
<P>The unmasking of Hypocrites is the great bu∣siness
of Satire, according to that of <HI>Horace</HI> in
the first Satire of his Second Book.</P>

<L>—Est Lucilius ausus</L>
<L>Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem,</L>
<L>Detrabere &amp; pellem, nitidus quâ quisque per ora</L>
<L>Cederet, introrsum Turpis.—</L></Q>
<P>But how is it possible, for the most part, to
unmask a Hypocrite without entring into the
private Concerns of Life?</P>
<P><HI>Juvenal</HI> tells us in his first Satire, that all Hu∣man
Actions, all the Passions of Men, all their
Desires, and all their Inclinations, are the con∣stant
Subjects of his Satire.</P>
<Q><L>Quidquid agunt Homines, votum, timor, ira voluptas,</L>
<L>Gaudia, Discursus, nostri est farrago Libelli.</L></Q>
<P>Now will any one pretend that the private
Concerns of Life are not included in these
Verses?</P>
<P>I must confess the celebrated <HI>French</HI> Satirist has
been a little more retentive; but yet they must
know very little of him, who are to be told that he
sometimes enters, into the private Concerns of
Life; which once more are the just and adaequate
Subjects of Satire. But then the Satirist ought
to take care that the Censures are always Just,
and that either the Vices Satiriz'd are very Fla∣grant,
and of pernicious Example, or the Per∣sons
egregious Hypocrites.</P>
